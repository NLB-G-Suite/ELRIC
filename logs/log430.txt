11,01FlareChaser: You know Activision had made CoD a yearly franchise.
Rock MJ
Alister: Now now, don't troll the incompetents.

Rarity would be proud
swag level: trixie
"I'm sexy and I know it"

Rarity would approve
Reikim : the poor kid never stood a chance
03they're lazy?

03I'm asking that
03not saying it
TheHoodyMaid: Next level: Socks.

/me pushes hoodedxmasskills into the volcano just to annoy him
I'm not cold! I'M WEARING A SWEATER!
Ugh i spit it out
Sweaters are cool
TheHoodyMaid: Vinyl Scratch is best DJ. Hands. Down.
02probably, if they made the game you're talking about
i don't think you can't sacrifice a bot Shamroc
Wasted money
Goes to show that kindness and generosity are the two best elements and ponies.
03they diod
otakon: nah it was adventure time reference

TheHoodyMaid: USE THE BASS CANNON

mickey mouse in sorcerer hat
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QESXBoKpBA&feature=fvwrel

Alister: are you honestly upset? I'm not really implying homsexuallity on your part
the hey?
Twi_Fi: yum
TheHoodyMaid: Use the Bass Cannon! You can win this in one shot!
also HOLY SHIT MARIO PARTY 2!
MARIO PARTY!
3This is not emulation
the end of the courage and dilbert hours
scoundrel, ruffian!
11,01Look at those volume bars!
HOLY SHIT SON mario party 2!
02A lot of developers do, it's very hard to up port xBox games to the PS3. So a lot of them just port it over sometimes even making it look worse
Mario Party?:O
Reikim: Check my recent post
Wario you evil person!
Alister: and even if you were it wouldn't bother me in the least
03that's my point
oh streaming from your tv?
seriously the HELL is this
@Maid_Discord : I'm kinda tired of all the things fapplebloom is saying to me. Can you warn him ?
03so herp derp saying PS3 is better
/me hides
Maid_Discord: IKR
TheHoodyMaid: Oh my God you win
oh so this weekend's brony movie night looks AMAZING
all the fighinh
Mario Party 2 is the best one
otakon, Mario party
SlurryMoon: Mario party?
only mario party I've played was 4
nope
SO MANY. FEELS
02PS3 is better, it's just that a lot of developers are too lazy
ikr
03exactly.
Dken2021: ONLY PARTY I PLAYED WAS 1
Silence of the Lambs/Troll 2 Movie Night will be one of the best EVAR
03GameCube was better than PS2, but nobody did anything with it so most people think PS2 is better.
03:P
hiya RAWRity
and mario still gets the name, princess totally objective right ?
hey otakon
:3
RAWRity!!!! :D
hai RAWRity!
02Rayman origins and Final fantasy prove that. They both look better on the PS3
ALL OF THE FEELS.
Nope
I WEEP!
Twilight wants to play too. :3
Hai RAWRity
I played Mario party 8 before.
ok so to all of those who dont beleive me watch this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDPPaDbrsE

Shamroc: fraid not
Wait. This is after Mario 64. Why did they go back to referring to Peach by the wrong name?
AAAHHH I KEEP GETTING STUCK
Cello RAWRity

Alister: would it help if i gave you a heartfelt apology?
03that game is such a lie

SlurryMoon on a N64?
fapplebloom : no I don't want your apology. I just want you to stop speaking to me
anyone agree?
11,01FlareChaser is best chaser.
Celloooooooooo LadyCanary :D
...whos second..
TheHoodyMaid: D:
Questions: You guys ever see something in fiction that hits just a little too close to home? Like, even if it's well done, it's a little too..relateable to be totally uncomfortable?
oh you got someone playing with ya

/me huggles LadyCanary
/me has returned after switching computers
Who are you playing with?
o/////o oh vinyl...
:3

TheGreatAndPowerfulT..hmm?
I have to go now bye peoples
Maid_Discord: i find it hard to not interpret that as erotic
03I ran into that with a few DS and Wii games
Which Mario Party is this one?
11,01It's not.
03after wasting $50 on Pokémon Battle Revolution I stopped buying Wii games >_>
k
TGAPT Thist Shamtastic
Sham Howdy
03as that was just STUPID

11,01I'm never erotic.
Everlasting_Joy: 2
Kandarihu Gratzi.
Nittany_Discord: but you are saucy at times
so you are asexual?
FlareChaser: Bitch please
lol
Maid_Discord isnt erotic?:O
02I paid $10 for it at Wal-mart :'D
bai TheHoodyNinja
I would hope not, Nittany_Discord is a dude.
......what the hell is happning!
TheHoodyNinja: I counter! http://www.gamesprays.com/files/resource_media/preview/fluttershy-medic-5619_preview.jpg
Kandarihu: oh,you answer Everlasting_Joy and not me
02was on sell

Worst Spacesuit Design Ever.

02Wal-mart is stupid like that
That's it ! I've made up my mind ! FlareChaser might have Colgate but Nightmare Moon is all mine
:3
:D
Reikim: I have to leave, so whatever man
Hi Kencolt! Didnt see you there ^_^

Or rather .. I'm all her's
03screw actual gameplay, I bought it so I can rip the audio
Awww LTB XD
fapplebloom..makin fun of his mom lol
Alister: What about Twilight? She seems a little lonely right now.
Is this a recording?
imjustaderper: sorry
Kencolt: live.
Shamroc: ...huh?
Kencolt nope, live.
Kencolt: I do believe it's live
this part is derpy-riffic!
02tell me, what is "this game" you keep talking about? D:
Grats SlurryMoon
fapplebloom..peach is the streamers mother
Reikim : Twilght i great and even the best but she's not aggresive enough
lol yoshi died
Weeegeeee
oh gog this game bring back nostalgia and its hitting me right in the childhood
yay
Yoshi Nuuuuuu......I mean.....yay Sweetie :)
and onkey kong ran away holding his butt
6lost it
03you're going to ew it
11,01Who's playing with SlurryMoon?
03but
3heheh, SlurryMom is
03Def Jam Rapstar
I was not prepared for Luigi's high-pitched voice.
haha
6never heard of it
03it's like a Rock Band type game in which you rap along to songs
03:P
02lmao
03but
Shamroc: i highly doubt that's true but ok
03the songs are stored as instrumental+acapella
NOSTALGIA!
02never heard of it either
11,01Tell your mom I said hi.
03>Rare rap instrumentals
Nittany_Discord his mom :)
6ah
03well worth the $1 I paid
ikr
SlurryMoon: your lucky you've got a mom that plays vidya games with ya!
lol ninja
fapplebloom..ask SlurryMoon then
03they had all 3 versions, Xbox 360/Wii/PS3 for $1
Its just me, TheHoodyNinja, and Reikim.....
http://derpy.me/EGJcS
otakon: ikr
03so I got the 360/PS3 as ew Wii, that's not going to help get good quality rips at all
Reikim: You just sent me to Funnyjunk.
SlurryMoon: The fact that your mom gave birth to you instantly makes her awesome
LIKE A BOSS
I DONT EVEN REMEBER OWNING THIS...but im still hit by nostalgia
03but if you go into practice mode, you can just say "vocals off" and play the entire song instrumental. xD
FalreChaser: What? I...what?
Shamroc: fictional characters cannot have corporeal children
02EW wii version of a PS3/xBox game
03Exactly
gotta do my homework D:
03Rock Band was fun on the Wii, but only because of homebrew
03that lets you add custom songs
I think funnyjunk is an unreliable site to link from.
i still own it
Good luck with that scootminer
03in terms of audio quality it's terrible
Tends to link just to homepage.
homework is overrated
FlareChaser: Damn, sorry 'bout that
.....question fapplebloom if he is fictonal and therefore not real..how is this being played streamed and how is he typeing?
just drop out
Bowl over
fapplebloom Agreed.
02Didn't know the wii had bad audio quality too
03that's the thing
I LOVE THIS MINGAME
03I think it can output CD-quality (as in, 44.1kHz)
FAP FAP FAP
03but nobody does it
no
03even games lik Brawl
03are 32kHz
Hmm. I need to find something super happy to get my mind off of this. Who'd have thought a visual novel would have managed to bug me out this much?
03which sounds terrible on a computer
10x9=90
dat math
3oh gog...
Shamroc: ...then he is a real person masquerading as a fictional woman's offspring?
3Diod you see that? o.o
THE CHAMP IS HERE
THE CHAMP IS HERE AFTER A VERY LONG LEAVE, BEEN EXTREMELY BUSY
11,01fapplebloom: It's a bit late for me. I graduated.
03so Rock Band was originally CD quality on Xbox 360/PS3 (literally the EXACT SAME files, as I said) and then they made it crap for Wii
slick
Donkey Kong isn't happy.
SlurryMoon: yah hahahaha
(O_O)/" Hallo thar bronystate

FlareChaser: Funny, I also found something to make up for that dead link: http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/58b12221d148279d4b31e796b21e0071/66824%20-%20fluttershy%20mechanical_wings%20robot.png
Randall1160: welcome back champ
fapplebloom: 2 cpus 2 humans...EXPLAIN THAT TO ME MY GOOD SIR!
hey Bobeh
Shamroc: i honestly can't, im so confused...
nighty hoodedxmasskills
Yay Slurry!
YO Bobeh
Im dying from nostalgia right now
2 human players. Who's the other guy?
02the 3DS has pretty good audio quality. (I've plugged it into my speakers before through the headphone jack)
11,01I'm still working on my thesis work. I'm taking it to a publication.
Brushing Powers activated, Bringing more Reinforcements.
RAWRity what novel ?
Shamroc: say again?
im pretty sure i dont have a single one now..
/me has become a noob again.
also hi RAWRity ~
Shamroc: 2 cups 2 what?
Did my chat derped ?
imjustaderper: HI
DAMMIT !
03until the 3DS is hacked I'll have no way of knowing what sampling rate it is
11,01I need to optimize a very slow program.
03I'm going to bet it's not 44.1
Back
N64 was, imo, the greatest console Nintendo put out
02LOL probably not
fapplebloom...i think you need contacts or glasses
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: visual novel called "Katawa Shoujo". Played it yesterday, and there are some parts that kind of...got to me.
Ewww
Nittany_Discord what language?
03since you're more of an artsy person I'll explain it like this: sampling rate is to audio as pixel depth (or rather, the amount of "bits" in an image) is to images
11,01C.
11,02http://macromeme.com/cat/diglet-tooth-wut.jpg
03like, difference between an 8-bit bitmap and a 24-bit one
03:P
RAWRity: I've heard of that actually, been meaning to check it out
It also had the best controller
03CDs are 44.1kHz, DVDs are 48
dat SuperSaxyMaid64
i want a car with my head on it
my mothers freinds daughter has it and i cant get it back becaues my mom and her stoped talking..
11,02O.O
Shamroc: i am currently wearing contacts. But what are we talking about again?
03crappy web streams are usually 22 or less
/me runs
wat
Gosh Darn it SuperSaxyMaid64
02ah
dang it SuperSaxyMaid64, now can't unsee
SunderlandPony89: you should. it's really, really well written.
XD
god i hate this minigame...
fapplebloom...yeah makes sesne
If you need any help with that just call Nittany_Discord :)
Hai SuperSaxyMaid64
Ah...
11,02Hai ^-^
Moo
Reikim: How about we do different catogories?
Shamroc:it doesn't to me...
SuperSaxyMaid64 :3
SuperSaxyMaid64. WHAT IS THIS? Are you SuperBrony64, or Saxy, or...what?
RAWRity: It was in development for 5 years, so it damn well better be :P
I'll be back later. I must accomplish some things so I can feel like I have a reason for living. Cya later all!
oh he superbrony
/me huggles SuperSaxyMaid64
FlareChaser: Sounds good. Two minutes to find image?
well next time dont drop outa school then fapplebloom..
RAWRity iirc correctly is the one with the disabled girls ?
G'night Twi_Fi, and good luck
Reikim: What should we do first?
nighty Twi_Fi
I LOVE face lift!!!
Later Twi_Fi.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Yeah, it is
Shamroc: noted
FlareChaser: Let's ask the chat!
02are Blu-rays more than DVDs?
Reikim: k
...I MISS IT SO!
Reikim ask what?
I remember this game
Shamroc: i am ending this discourse, farewell
?
03for blank ones, yeah
*minigame
03to produce? Who knows
SunderlandPony89: well, it IS an indipendent game, and each story path is a good 8 hours, so It's not surprising it took so long.
03Sony is stupid like that
/me hugs Shamroc
/me huggles LunaTheBeloved back :3
anypony else know that if you pres sthe arrows up and down on your keybord you can see your previous comments
oh god i loved this minigame
Dken2021: We're having an image war, because. We're looking at different categories.
WTF is with Dk's face
so many memories
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: you would be correct.
Why does DK have to be the victim of the face lift?
RAWRity: DAMN man, 8 hours?! I thought it would be much shorter!
I really wanna play some Donkey Kong 64 now.....
03that's one reason I wanted HD-DVD to win the format war, it was an open format
...thanks...even thou you wanted to sacrafise me not more then 5 minutes ago
02and the fanboys are even dumber
/me runs
RAWRity: Rin's good ending actually made me cry
i used to have the 4th or 1st of the games
Everlasting_Joy: cause he kidnapped princes speach before,heres his punishment
03Blu-Ray on the other hand, Sony makes royalties off of every one sold, regardless of what brand/movie studio is it
03>_>
03*it is
:D
3yay~
RAWRity: Which VN are you playing?
i'm it's been a long time since i played that and it was indeed sad
03one reason why Xbox 360 will never have Blu-Ray support
anypony else know that if you pres sthe arrows up and down on your keybord you can see your previous comments
03Microsoft isn't going to just give money to Sony LOL
Hey, I said save the Chicken
Grats grats
SunderlandPony89: and that's just for ONE path. There's a total of 5 paths, with good and bad (and sometimes neutral) endings.
it's LONG
/me is reminded of his days playing Mario Party 4, and all the frustrations he had while playing
Reikim: Hurry go
3oh my frik...
HAHAHAHA
hi FlareChaser
lol...
3I just got a star xD
hi FlareChaser
FlareChaser: ?
hi FlareChaser
AHAHAA
hi FlareChaser
02probably the same reason the wii U won't use it
RAWRity: what game are you playing?
:D
imjustaderper: go way
i call haxxx on luigi
11,02LunaTheBeloved: Dat 64 ping
CupcakeWarrior: I chose Hanako's path and...let's just say there were some parts that were a little TOO relateable.
RAWRity: Ok, now I gotta play this game
FLARECHASER!!!!
HAX
03Wii is weird
!HAX HAX HAX!
otakon: Katawa Shoujo
03as it uses DVDs, but they aren't *called* DVDs
i dont know who you are
heheh
Too many exclamation points!
03they're called "Wii Optical Discs"
RAWRity: um, come again?
flarechase:
i wonder hwo much dings flarechaser got :D
WHY IS EVERYONE SAYING MY NAME? What...
03Why? So that Nintendo doesn't have to pay to use the DVD trademark
03>_>|
flarechaser:
FlareChaser:
03but format wise they're the same thing
/me 11,01gives SlurryMoon a star.
D:
FlareChaser FlareChaser FlareChaser
02Nintendo like to make their own stuff .-.
Look at the link FlareChaser
FlareChaser: i was just going along with the crowd
ding ding ding ding ding
03they don't though
02likes*
So SlurryMoon! Yeah.......*cough* Come on Yoshi *cough*
Alister: I did, awesome.
*Go
03they just steal the technology and rename it
03:P
otakon: that's the game's name, Katawa Shoujo.
3nooooo ;n;
Honestly, the only bad thing about Katawa is that you have sex with disabled girls
02LOL true
3Mommy died :<
FlareChaser: What were we doing again?
And thats gross
:(
03DVDs are different from Blu-Rays in that nobody collects royalties
RAWRity: and once again what?
Nuuuuuu
Flarechaser is hearign ding dign
LunaTheBeloved..who do you play charcter wise on all the mario games?
3or at least lost all her coins >>
03But, in order to call something a "DVD", technically, you have to pay to use the trademark
hi FlareChaser
Reikim: ummm Catorgories.
03as the DVD logo has a little ® after it
hi FlareChaser
Yoshi
03so Nintendo was like "OK, let's just not call them DVDs"
03>_>
Always
imjustaderper: go away Austin
hi FlareChaser
CupcakeWarrior: is that...really all that bad a thing? Also, you can turn off the 18+ setting.
hi FlareChaser
SlurryMoon, who are you?
Yoshi is best dinosaur
hi FlareChaser
thingy
/me pats SlurryMoon's mom on the back
yay
Everlasting_Joy: he's Wee Gee I think
3I'm luigi
Everlasting_Joy, Luigi
02kind of smart if you think about it XD
yeah
Alister: lol
3Mother is Peach
I knew it WEE GEE!
RAWRity: Wasnt that game made by 4channers?
03which is probably the main reason the Wii can't play DVD videos
otakon: Katawa Shoujo. Translates roughly "Cripple Girl"
i do dry-bones when able..
Gotcha, thank you.
03or else they'd be sued for using the format without paying
03there are Japanese ones that can play DVDs, but they cost more obviously :P
02yeah
waluigi
Alister: We're doing an image showdown, and we need a category. I'm Fluttershy, FlareChaser is Colgate. Suggestions?
Silly Peach :3
11,01SlurryMom, why you go in circles?
CupcakeWarrior: yes, actually. And I was surprised that it wasn't offensive in the least.
in this one luigi
03(Whereas if you hack your Wii it can play DVDs just fine, albeit really crappy quality because LOL GAMECUBE HARDWARE)
Ikr
02wait, really?
RAWRity: oh that one, the dating sim where you go out with girls with physical disabilities
03YUes.
03-u
02do want
I've always been with Yoshi since I started playing Mario Parties
03dude why
03Wii is terrible
Reikim : I'm Nightmare Moon
Bye guys, gonna call it a day
lolwut.
otakon it was made by 4channers
otakon :D, Weegee.
bye cutenesskitteh take care
Night cutenesskitteh
Night everypony
02that just would be neat to have XD
bye cutenesskitteh
Maybe to set the trap
03and you can buy upscaling DVD players for like $20
CupcakeWarrior: um not from what I heard
03I fail to see why people want their video game consoles to play DVDs
haio everypony
Twilie!
03The TV that my Wii is attached to
3heheh..
MASH THA BUTTON!
hey hey everypony
FlareChaser: I have been invalidated.

DAT DANCING
wha wha whaaaa....
I Call HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAX on luigi !
Howdy tetra.
otakon: I heard it was made by a group of 4channers, actually
owned
heheheh
otakon: eeyup. It was made by posters on 4chan, after a post on there back in 2007 with pictures of ideas for a dating sim with disabled girls.
yeah i did too but the second that drybones came out i was on that shit lika SuperBrony64 on dairy products
SunderlandPony89: I will look this up

02well, I use an actual DVD player
RAWRity: I hear it's interesting

Fail
Alister: But that was indeed badass.
/me waves bye to everypony :)
otakon: you really should.
Careful SuperBrony64, you might kill us with that pic
A Wild SuperBrony64 appears
03I use the PS3 because of upscaling
11,02:<
SB: HNNNNG!
I wonder if we'll ever get a decent ponies text game
SB dose eyes ;u;
how is everypony
03the regular DVD player is crap and from years ago
SuperBrony64: so CUTE!
03doesn't do HD at all
02my brothers PS3 is used for blu-rays (he thinks it's his) :D
hai tetra, doing good
/me throws poke-ball at wild SuperBrony64
PLATFORM PERIL!<3
danke
03I use the PS3 for playing anything video
03and NOT for gaming :D
otakon: well, somebody's working on a pony Dating Sim atm iirc
wait a moment
this is basically a quick time event
Go Yoshi!
hi tetra, doing great, u?
RAWRity: It better not have 34 in it
RAWRity: yeah but I hear it was........*shudders*
<3 Platform Peril
what are we watchibg
CupcakeWarrior: I've heard of one in the works
:3
03though the PS3 does one thing that bugs me
02in terms of gaming I only play Rayman origins and Final fantasy on it
03it doesn't upscale videos stored on BLu-Rays
otakon: Would you play a pony dating sim?
Hello.
hahah yoshi
03like when the video discs have standard-def special features
RAWRity: That's... interesting. And unsurprising.
otakon: CupcakeWarrior I believe they also have a setting where you'll be able to turn off the 18+ stuff.
03it'll output them at 480
colgate is good toothpaste
03which looks terrible on my TV
oh good
^
Reikim: well it depends if it's well written really
03the Xbox 360 will upscale non-HD stuff on HD-DVDs
03so eh
Jeez, all that work for nothing Slurry.
3heheh...
sooo someponys playing mary poarty
Hai MahBoi777 !
*mario party
/me is captured :O

tetra: is your keyboard underwater or something?
hello...Troll!:D
Be free my son!
BE FREE
02oh and Dawn of the Dragon, but I got sick of it for now
haha
/me uses net on SuperBrony64
Which, in Katawa Shoujo, I was surpsied that they actually deliberately made the sex scene with Hanako as awkward an unarousing as possible. Makes sense too.
no im switching beetween laptop and desktops often
RAWRity: same with Misha.
/me uses knife on net
And Ibarazaki.
03I bought Little Big Planet because everybody told me it was the best game ever, it was really boring and I stopped afte ra day
.. LunaTheBeloved i was gonna set him free after i renamed him..
03and I have Katamari Forever because LL told me to get it, but eh.
so we watch podcasts??
03Beautiful Katamari on Xbox 360 is better IMO :P
Of course you were...
oh god this one
This game
RAWRity: Same thing with the deaf one
02when was it made?
tetra: Games and movies
03which

03Release date(s)

Throw him in the day care with a ditto and comeback later
I mean........................Yay Slurry!
Reikim: um WHAT IS THAT!?!
im so lazy when it comes to drawing
Oh my....
02oh that's why.
otakon: An MLP dating sim project.
02Most games looked better on the xBox 360 until later
LunaTheBeloved..why wont you belive me!
03hm?
sounds fun
Reikim: it was Fluttershy Wing Gundam
dk you suck
i got this great pinkie pie but i have yet to put the finishing touches on
otakon: Okay what the hell
Friend of mine had a track coach in high school who would constantly yell at the runners. Eventually "Dammit, get your head in the game!" became a running joke for us.
I wonder how Absolute Balance it coming along
Reikim: I got that too
I do...
02Back then was when developers were being the laziest towards the ps3
I said "Of course you were" and "Mhmm"
i think im good at pinkie pies voice i could make good impressions
02which is why you say Beautiful Katamari looks better on xBox
otakon: I think my computer is acting up
RAWRity, Booooooo
so this one time i had a nightmare where pinkie pie molested me
03you mean like how older DVDs look better than newer ones because they weren't intentionally making crappy transfers on DVDs in order to make people want Blu-Rays? :P
tetra: record a bit on soundcloud and give us the link
RAWRity: I c wat u did thar
otakon: THIS is the site for the MLP dating sim http://www.gentlecolts.org/
ah
soundcloud???
03and no
:3
......bu...but but your being sarcastiv
02pretty much
03Beautiful Katamari is 360 only
sarcastic*
02oh
03Katamari Forever is PS3 only
03they're similar games, different titles
SunderlandPony89: I actually didn't do anything. That pun was a happy accident.
11,01Dance, SlurryMoon, Dance!
why i must remembere Katawa Shoujo that novel was good
02same age?
XD
i will whenever i get my computers wireless antena
03uh, lemme check?
Man you never had a chance.
12Katamari <3
tetra: online recording site, you can import sound files and record stuff and upload it online as long as you have a mic
03Release date(s) 	
03JP July 23, 2009[1]
03EU September 18, 2009[2]
03NA September 22, 2009[3]
03newer
sarcasm ? on my internets ? i don't think so
ooooooohhh
02ah, it would be hard to tell
Come on Yoshi
tetra: you have a mic?
derp
12NS, Danny's right
:3
yeah
02the newer the title the harder it is to know
tetra wait, use this http://vocaroo.com/ faster
Lawlz
tetra: well there you go
03LOL
03well
03like I said
03each one is exclusive to that system
Peach wins XD
12^
03so it has nothing to do with "lazy developers"
/me changes back from troll to Lopy
03I just prefer BK because it doesn't start with crappy graphics
12none of the Katamari games are cross-platofrm
03Supposedly in KF you can unlock them
03but I"m lazy
02so the PS3 one might look better
03and yeah
Ok Forget about Nightmare Moon , It's Season 2 Luna now (back to the start ?)
03well
SuuuuP everypony!
I'm baaaaaaaack~
Guys. Guys! This. http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/05/introducing-brony-thank-you-project.html

Hai MahBoi777 :)
Come on Yoshi!
03Beautiful Katamari lists it as "720p/1080i/1080p"
11,01Yay SlurryMoon
Weegee's voice is so wrong. . .

/me runs

Everlasting_Joy and those legs O_O
Hm

I dunno
DaringDude: The best
02inb4: 1080i 1080p 720p
Thwomp! :3
Dken2021 Yeah no kidding.
03720p is better than 1080i
Yoshi is a baws
02true
031080i should be avoided at all costs unless you actually need it
03or if it's 60fps
03but it's usually not
03XD

dat theme song
CupcakeWarrior: O U

So this show is what show?
http://macromeme.com/dog/double-standard-computer.html
zo i decided to emu it on my PC, the PS3 controller drivers are a bit troublesome though, but it works eventually
watch sum archer!
also, gotta say. I still kind of want to punch Misha in the face when she talks.
Whahaha!
RAWRity: it gets better though the route.
Wahahahahaha~.
Black woman says sit down, you sit down
Midnight_Tempest: hahaha pwn
Wait, stop looking at me with that glare, RAWRity
I swear, her text uses so many god damn tildes, I think Nyria wrote this route.
http://macromeme.com/dog/aint-gettin-no-sleep.html
Misha is Rarity in disguise, WahaHA!
http://macromeme.com/dog/booping-dog.html
Midnight_Tempest how could you. /sob
RAWRity: no, Nyria is Misha. (Maybe)
i might see if i can find a 2ndhand copy of Katamari Forever for PS3 for cheap, though i put my PS3 back in the box because i don't really have a permanent place for it
lol
Is that the dude?
Mutterguy: because im an evil canadian... and yes, they do exist
WallDives: unless Misha turns out to be a guy in the end, I don't think that fits.
Midnight_Tempest: lmao

"Oh, this girl who I'm not totally sure about my feelings for is bearing her soul to me, bringing me into her traumatic past, and I'm the first person she's ever told it to, even before her only other friend? CLEARLY THIS MEANS WE SHOULD FUCK."
Hanako isnt even attractive

Hanako is kind of cute, imho

VIRUS IS TURNING THEM INTO ALIENS

Shizuka: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Af_9oOHn-k
Hello WallDives!
thats alot of ppl
RAWRity: I'm not giving you any ideas because I LIKE you or anything. Got that? :|
13exactly rawrity <3
/me gives SuperBrony64 a.... GREAT BUG HUG
Big*
/me glomps SuperBrony64
Polydunami: you don't pull of Tsundere well.
/me hugs Chrysalis and Midnight_Tempest back
yay!
11,02All the hugs ^-^
Who?
i think meanwhile would be a good Tsundere character
Polydunami: Tsundere, like the character trait?
rly cows
pony control panel
13n-not that Polydunami WANTED to pull off tsundere well
Yeah I know. Just trying to save face :$
Tsundere is a person that acts all tough on the outside but is a big softy inside
ewww
Polydunami: basically a character archetype that likes somebody, and acts like a dick to them to hid it."
03I don't do the D and F in my name in cursive
03just print XD
think Helga from Hey Arnold
13tsun tsun, dere dere
13asuka is the classic~
lol
RAWRity beat me to it.
I need to lie down for the night, I'll talk to you all tomorrow.
NOOOO
I know all of this, everypony
13:3
when does the next EVA movie come out...
BUILDINGS ARE LIVING
RAWRity if i get choosed do i get to see the game simulator before it comes out ?
6ew cursive Ds
13next year i believe
shes just a bitch though
13or was this fall
6mine is half cursive, half print
13i forget..
Fine. Don't give me the tsundere personality. See if I care
13^ X3
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: even better, you get to MAKE IT :D
6I hate that little loop on the bottom left
/me can't wait for them to bring over the new Berserk movie
is the wall evryone that died?
we cant tell otakon about it though. it'll be a surprise.
Actually, PLEASE don't make me a tsundere... Please?
Eva 3.0 is out this fall
RAWRity i could give a hand at making it once this courseworks over
RAWRity xD
13yay~
also, to get Meanwhile's route, you have to do something with Trixie.
13that means the dvd will be out in 2014 >>
you guys have all lost me :P
Polydunami: don't worry, Meanwhile will be the Tsundere
fluttershy is so moe
That's a better tsundere by far
RAWRity and locked to always be with trixie?
Shizuka: what, was it licensed by Viz? those fuckers take forever.
11,02Silk worms actually have their salivary glands replaced with the silk glands so their silk fibers are produced near their mouth.
hang on... if all the targets are bronies... is the charachter a female?
:|
which one of the mane six would b tsundere?
13funimation
pegasiss666: probably Rarity.
03of what, D?
oh, yeah, I heard that the Paradise Kiss manga is getting rescued. neat.
Rainbow Dash would be the Tsundere type, I think.
id think rd
6yeah
pegasiss666: Hmm... I would probably say Rainbow Dash
funimation takes pretty long to release things too...
11,02Shizuka's name starts with the letter S.
just look at how she responds to books.
6and F is just a horrible cursive letter
SuperBrony64: NAWWWWW
SuperBrony64: NO WAY!
6you knwo what cursive letter is fun
Chrysalis nope you will be the gay option /joke
6capital Z
SuperBrony64: I thought her name was Zhisuka
You pulling my leg, SuperBrony64?
its a tundra
13it does?
Well too bad, I got three legs to stand on
6doesn't look like a Z, I hate cursive in general, but it's so fun
13well how bout that
03it looks like a 2
lol
6ikr
03I hare cursive in gener...you said that
03OK}
i always thought it was a 5
11,01I start with the letter *Explodes*
6xD
RAWRity question humans or ponies simulator?
6stupid requirements to learn it
6it's stupid
6ugly
03yeah
13BOOM i t t a n y....
03"You'll need it in high school" Um, no you won't
6and as pretty as it's supposed to look, NO ONE writes like that
lol
TheGreatAndPowerfulT there are several questions for this game which worry me
6my cursive is just.....
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Either or. you can choose either
that is one of them
11,02If I could rearrange the alphabet...
Polydunami starts with the letter pie
/me is back from karate. "Hello everypony" :>
RAWRity, male or female
6you look at it, your eyes burn out of their sockets
dat scares me
11,02I'd be God :I
Chrysalis: either or, again you can choose.
o.0
hi XAX
Oh hey XAX :3
At Bronystate academy, everyone swings both ways
wb XAX
man there is going to be ALOT of routes in that game
wb XAX.
i used to do a signature of my initials, now it's my full name in scribbles
11,01Game?
13http://screensnapr.com/v/NnB3M9.png halfway there
6same
6scribble signatures ftw
Let me rephrase that. HIYAAAH XAX!
RAWRity, that is a lie... i only like the ladies...
Nittany_Discord: joking about making a Bronystate dating sim
RAWRity awww joking?
Midnight_Tempest: not in this game you don't
that would of been amusing
Such enthusiasm, Polydunami :)
11,01Lol.
Chrysalis: I have nowhere near the skill or determination to make this for real.
Nittany exploding would be a loading screen or something
we could make otakon the default route
11,01Someone might go out and make it real.
RAWRity: well im not in that game... am I? HOW DID I GET IN THAT GAME!
RAWRity well you can make Midnight_Tempest the one who is in denial
Chrysalis: otakon is the playable character.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: that would be Meanwhile... you know he loves Trixie XD
6NOOOO
WallDives i like that solution
Midnight_Tempest about his sexuality
6I need to be in bed hahaha
03so do I but I'm not tired
03as usual
Midnight_Tempest we already know he is in denial about trixie
/me wants to be in the dating sim
6I could just not go to class tomorrow
Midnight_Tempest's route eventually leads to him admitting he's attracted to otakon, and then share a passionate night in a field of fireflies and sunflowers. Then, as the morning sun peeks over the horizon, they spend several minutes just staring into one another's eyes.
http://macromeme.com/dog/studying-test-troll.html
03that's what I did today
03XD
Wrek is the librarian who always kicks otakon out
6my teacher loves me and she knows how much work I have to do
03I was freaking out so bad last night though
^
03because I was like
They don't neet to say anything because...it's already been said.
6if I didn't show up, she'd be like "oh, are your animations going ok?"
to all nighter or not all nighter
6sure, animating, that's wat I was doing.
that is the question
03"This is midterm week... did our teacher announce the midterm? What if it's tomorrow?"
/Good End
RAWRity: for the love of... HAVE YOU BEEN READING MY DIARY! <_< >_> uh... never mind that... .////.
6all nighters are ok unless class is the next day
Sumica is the assistant librarian
03but then I pulled up the syllabus from my phone while I was lying in bed panicking
03and it said "midterm is 6th week"
Will the bronystate dating sim have sex scenes?
03this is 5th week
03so I was like OK and skipped
13just passed 15000 frames rendered
03and slept until 7PM even
03XD
6because there's that hour or so around 10am after an all nighter
6that just sucks.
03yep.
all the frames?
03that's what I ran into yesterday
03hence sleeping until 7 today :P
CupcakeWarrior: Yes, but you will have the option to turn them off
6if you make it throgh that, you're good
hello everypony
6but I always seem to get stuck in it
hey YamaTHou
Oh hey YamaTHou :)
So, you guys here about the controversy with "The Hobbit" film?
http://screensnapr.com/v/lUuGTT.jpg
RAWRity: I would be okay with them
this right here
dat filly twilight
*hear
is going on my wallp
wall*
i think im gonna play a little DoW: DC before bed...
what is this?
YamaTHou: This is Dilbert
THIS IS BRONYSTATE!
RAWRity and what's my route, story thingy ?
03I made it through that
apparently, Peter Jackon's filming it at 48 FPS. This has had the unfortunate side-effect of making the sets look like shit in the final product.
03gbut I know what you mean
03-g
Midnight_Tempest, it is?
03and then when I was done with class around noon, I was liek "Why am I not tired, I should actually sleep now"
Polydunami is a background character
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Haven't thought of it yet.
Twi_Fi: nope, this is my basement and you're my prisoner ^__^
:O
The one who is slightly loopy, I guess
me flees.
should i be scared ?
RAWRity: so, how far along are you in Mishizune's route~?
Can I be your prisoner too, Midnight_Tempest?
cause I scared
NINJAZZ :D
13ping
Ohai XAX
Ohai Shizuka
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I'm thinking "wild sex while bungie jumping off a bridge, and then one of you breaks a leg while doing it."
XAX: hmmm... sure... the more the merrier
Ninjazz: Dat rarity epilogue ;_;
13it is pitch dark
13you are likely to be glomped by a superbrony
XAX: Yeah.....................................

http://macromeme.com/dog/magnification.html
XAX: I don't know man... That was really powerful...
XAX: I'm just not sure...
Chrysalis...is that a real game??? I hope so :)

aaawww...:S

03and then I set my alarm so I'd only take a 5 hour nap
Hey, if people made Katawa Shoujo a reality, why not that?

Ninjazz: I read your comment. I always go looking for your comment after I read a chapter of that story :)

What an odd game. But it works. O_O
Ninjazz: Tbh, I'm actually only a third of the way through the Celestia epilogue. I had to go to karate before I could read all of it. I'm having dinner right now, but I'll read it afterwards :)

/me slips into the shadows and begins stalking people in the chat.
Tbh I barely read EqD. I probably should more...
80,000 words? I better charge my iPad

So much better.
Would be hard-pressed to call My Little Dashie the best pony fanfic ever

Polydunami, I still owe it alot.
I've already read fics that I like better than MLD, although it's still a good read

Well, it used to be
I certainly wouldn't want to see this be messed up by lottery for the first time. But I would also like to give people a good reason to come see this sweet intermission.
I only wish I knew who this Indian Stallone.
Goodnight, SlurryMoon.
HA!
Liked and faved Shizuka.
/me ALWAYS forgets to remove the color codes from things when he copies something a mod says.

Shane377: what's that?

Always makes me stomp my feet in beat.

13hope it's dub
MahBoi777: coach said holy crap shane cause when i served it was like death from above
Ninjazz: Hoofstomp

13yay~

13<3 batou's VA
Mica
Erryday ahm dubbin
dubdubdubdub
14
OHH myyy
Shane377: Lol nice
13oh my X3
00,10one of the few animes that I think is way better dubed
13^
Better than last time.
MahBoi777: he said my serves were unreturnable
Srry
agreed Sumica
dat.... ghost in the shell?
I already saw the dub of this. And while I recognize that the dub was likely done respectfully, I'm curious about the original.
I wouldn't know since I only watched the dub.
Phase4: I think so
It is.
13that's true... especially solid state society where they jump like four major plot threads over the course of the movie <3
00,10I realy am pissed I lost my 2.0 version of the movie
I've never seen Ghost in a Shell, looks interesting
00,10you ever seen 2.0 Shizuka?
MahBoi777: Same too
13innocence right? haven't seen yet
00,10no they remastered the first movie
13saw the original movie... felt so terribly slow compared to SAC
13oh
13i will have to track that down~
00,10using sac cgi for bits
00,10it's like 30min longer
13pug man!
SSS goes by the same continuity as SAC, right?
Lopy: okay good, not alone lol :P
00,10yeah
haha
13yeah it's like two years after 2ndGiG
Hey look! They actually use their lips to talk for once.
00,10SSS is around 1-2 years after second gig
Talking with lips is overrated
Ninjazz: GASP
13one of the very few dubs where the lip sync almost never falls apart
13compare speed racer where they have to cram everything in
lol
Everybody run, its Godzirra!
Lol
/me takes a deep breath
00,10yes i see
Fat guy is fat
Orly.
Redundant guy is redundant
hehe
13home affairs minister looks like a man with a pug for a head
13or a pig
13OINK
/me is sad no one got the joke
lol
13i got it sumi~<3
I didn't :(
First you wiggle your home affairs, oink oink oink
/me hugs Shizuka
Nope.
WHOAA
WHOAH
Did somebody say Sumi?!
I did.
xD
13the word sumi's client cannot hear!
13now i've said it!
00,10btw those that dont know they are like a swat team only more so.
Sumica is the knight that says yay.
13they're swat with +5 to tactics
00,10superswat
13THANK YOU EXPOSITION TOGUSA
00,10which looks realy dirty
Damn it, can't come up with a good SWAT acronym.
Off formpainting and texing again
lol
00,10So tonight was fun at work. IBM had a huge party
Party wooo
13actually... come to think of it, this dub gets to be so amazing cause they do a lot of their exposition where you can't see their lips
00,10Super Wub and Tacos
Somepony got drunk?
13or over comms where they aren't moving
00,10but yeah we had the goo goo dolls and red hot chili peppers
You're making me apprecaite the lip movement in a dub for once, Shizuka.
13it's so good <3
00,10dem normal swat guys suck
Dat Bass
00,10and yes gits has a great ost
13hello? terrorists? pay no attention to the camera hanging from the vent
Gotta get me this OST
00,10dat modem hack
wow
13haaaaaaaax
Did he just got ^
oh shit
O_o
Man down.
00,10sat boob shot
"All natural"
Too bad it was too short for a Mica
Nice dialogue timing.
13dat timing X3
lol
oh myyyyyy
Gotta love Takei
Ninjazz: I saw what you commented on 'The Heart Of A Dragon' and I shit my pants. That is ONE LONG AS COMMENT!!!
:$
Hi~ Hazard. How did like Heart of the Dragon?...
Amazing.
13kayabuki gets thrown under the bus so much this season
00,10i am so bummed out to find out Through the eyes of another is gonna end on a cliffhanger till he can rewrite the whole story
And... Which comment? I kinda wrote like 1 huge ass comment on every chapter past 6
00,10"cart blanch"
Ninjazz: I honest to god cried.
Blart canch
Ninjazz: everyone of them :D
LOL
Me too man.. :'(
Infact... I'm still kinda down from the Rarity epilouge
I still can't shake it off.
I was like "WHOA! wut." Then I was like "..." THEN I cried.
because of the Authors Notes
Cried from the authors notes?
13nice parking togusa... right in the middle of a lane

00,10good action in this ep
Bye MahBoi777

I know that feel, Hazard. It was so sad to finally see it end.
Dat awkward moment where you can't sneeze even though you feel like you have to.
Night MahBoi777
/me hugs chat:)
Ow.
Ninjazz: ending was kinda sudden with the time skip and crap but other than that it was PERFECT! absolutely FLAWLESS
Hazard: look at a bright light.
Betrayal.
00,10hacked
Hazard: I know man.... I know...
13so much for one shot one kill
lol
Dat cloak
and THATS why you don't do Mentats
Outlaw Star. Insomnia is being nice to me!
Dat tackle.
Hazard: I'm probably going to go read it again with the music Razorbeam told us not to listen to it with.
13i was never heeeeere~
No-- it's Ghost in the Shell. Still nice enough. \
Dat everything.
THATS how you play HARDCORE PARKOUR FOOTBALL!!
Ninjazz: sounds legit
You know what? The difference between the blood and gore in GiTS and in Metalocalypse is that here, there is a mature storyline, where over there, the gore is there for sight gags.
00,10crowning moment of awsome
>is warned not to do something >Does it anyway
13it's a shame this short version of I Can't Be Cool isn't on the OSTs
Ded.
Hazard: I'm probably going to cry my eyes out...
Holy shit...
00,10totaly riped from the first movie
Is there a longer version?
That was gory in every glorious way.
02derp!
Ninjazz: it will be GLORIOUS :')
That was cool haha
squeeee!
13the full version is later in the season
Oh, okay.
02someone, say derp now
13at least i think
13i forget..

I'm glad you liked it, Hazard. But all I am is a dude that got mentioned in the credits. :$
02derpy derp
02brb, shower
Still feels amazing to be actually named in the fic...
Hazard: U furry U
no fucking way! didnt see it! HAVE TO GO BACK!!!
YOU DIDNT?!
13PONIES
13oh... close enough
Touch coma?
The tachikomas are back!
13they're aliiiiiiiive <33
Oh my...
What the fudge.
O.o
00,10another good song
13really only makes sense if you saw season 1
thachi's best part of show
Oh man this song....
They're like teletubby versions of ED-209
This freakin good song...
The Dinner has been eaten!
00,10I used to use this song as my alarm
You remember when she decommissioned them because she was afraid their growing individualities would make them unsuitable as weapons? She was right. They're not here as weapons but as soldiers.
God damn this song...
Tachikoma. They are friendly, cute, happy, and only kill you under orders.
Sumica: Why the hell didn't i think of that?!
Ninjazz: you are my new Hero. Y U NO SAVE EARF FRUM MEATOR?!
:D
I'm no celebrity man. Just a rabid Rarity fan.
02*WB03(Ray03)02WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
Ninjazz: and im a rabid Luna fan
00,10oh btw this also has the shorts

Oh, this is a part that was NEVER shown on Adult Swim
Comrades
Ninjazz: woah....just read the first chapter...that was...sad *sniffs*

13i used this on my second mix <3
/me glomps Ninjazz , Hazard

Hazard: Understandable. But if you witnessed how Rarity was treated in the comments and replace her with Luna, you would flip a fuckin table.

I did.
/me receives the glomping with much... uh... nvm

You are very welcome, Go to bed. :|
/me still charges ipad
Ninjazz: do u wanna get the link a truly AWESOME fiction? its all animated on youtube!
:O
Actually...
It's amazing what I miss out of my anime when I'm at least partially asleep and am watching it for the first time with my mom. It takes a LOT of the goodness out of it.
I'm still kinda bummed out right now.
how come Ninjazz ?
Shit... This fucking good song...
00,10here is one I like alot
Dat song
And I pretty much blamed that entire circumstance for why I couldn't enjoy Bleach.
00,10soon as this ends that is =p
13velveteen is good
Ninjazz: want the link?
d3rb, my favorite fic finally ended. I was named in the credits as a motivation. The ending basically turned me into a sad sad sad little girl and made me cry my eyes out. For the first time might I add.
00,10indeed it is
Sumica's playing Lupin III again? *goes to Bronystate*
re through the eyes. Sumica, the rewrite is pretty good thogh
00,10Friday Tovler
Sure, Hazard. I'll get to it sometime.. .But right now... I kinda need to take a break from shit...
so bitter sweet
/me just read chapter 2.2
00,10oh it's great, just bummed to no end that it's gonna be clifhannered cause he wont continue it till rewrite is done
d3rb: Do you know which fic I am talking about?

Heart of a Dragon, d3rb. I recommend it.
d3rb: eeyup... READ IT OR DIE
:O IM READING IM READING!
:D
00,10shame the opening never realy has any ep to it
00,10cause it looks like it would be a great ep
You know how Japanese OPs are...
00,10well yeah as the OP has to sell the show

d3rb: I also recommend reading the comment sections. Alot of bronies (myself included) really opened up to it.
00,10it's not like US tv where you get get like 6new shows a year

Not just some tiny high damage pistol.
Phase4 didn't say hi to me :( i am hurt
Its a real goddamn magnum.

He kinda makes being a Cyborg sound bad...
What a story guy.
Did my IRC crash?
d
00,10that implys that there was a necular world war 4
Phase4: tee eff 2?
Hat, welcome.
Hai
"And when they realize what their going through... give them cake."
Who would have thought that there would still be a world after a world war 4.
It must take a while to draw these shows
inb4 Fallout
Just because he's an obvious conspiracy nut-- in this show-- does not mean he isn't right.
Ture...
XAX, school work sry :(
True...
Hat.
Phase4: Ok then :)
Hat Hat.
School > games
Hazard

Damn it, this guy doesnt get the Hub.
:D
Deagles
touche
00,10this ep reminds me of Taxi cab
Ninjazz, nah... if the major cities blow up You can probably build elsewhere. Nuclear winter is quite hard to achieve i think
Everytime a gun moves in a show, it clicks
i hate that i am a paranoid skitz, and i hate that my doctor thinks this medicine works......
inb4 he shoots the mirror' it bounces off' and he nooters himself.
I see.
00,10forthe record they have nano tech
The Neigh
Dat Che poster. He sees what's probably only part of the problem. He thinks he has the answer, but all he has is more problems.
Thats some deep fucking shit...
00,10and said nanotech has been used to scrub radiation
Well now...
Sumica: sounds easy really
Jeez, this guy should write poety...
This guy talks too much
Even if it is inside his own head
^
He thinks a lot. He says almost nothing.
We can hear it... He talks to much.
Meanwhile: care if I remove him sire? *cocks shotgun and sheaths balistic knives*
And we move from possibly right conspracy nut to possibly right stalker conspiracy nut.
/me bonks Hazard with a cinderblock.

Y U NO FUK MEH SUNNA
00,10december 25th

Tomorrow that guy is gonna get shot doing something stupid
This guy is crazy.
noooo. according to wikipedia ( and presumely the articles it cites) nuclear winter is actually a real threat.
What if he can duel wield
And it's official. That's the DEFINITION of a Conspiracy Nut.... "Only I know the truth."
War?...
RUN FROM THE PLANE
dat feel when you miss a backstab by 0.1 milliseconds right in a crowd of enemies
:()
I'm not saying he's not a conspiracy nut. Were you saying he's on the right wing?
Spy is hard class to master.
Rape Face
00,10day dreams of telling his boss off
He's on no known wing.
RAPE
He daydreams too much.
Perhaps, he's just crazy.
maybe he has a brain tumor
Oh, I realize. He sees everything as a right-wing conspiracy. Sorry.
-_(

Maybe even Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome.
Mornin' everypony x)

Airpuff, welcome.
Chances are he actually forgot.
hes drunk
What are we watching? =O
He sees EVERYTHING as a conspiracy-- RIght, left, and center.
00,10Ghost in the shell
13sleepy time for me~
Probably because he's, you know, a chairman, he does important stuff. And you're basically the taxi driver
Acctually I could see that Humanity in desperation to prevent global warming... they set of a whole bunch of nukes
=O

Mutterguy: the whole climate change thing is falling apart by it's hinges now. It won't be all of humanity struggling to fight this. Just the ones who benefit from the histeria.

But you're welcome.
Oh, the blood is easy. HE's NUTS.
did he kill someone?
inb4 barney
00,10it was all in his head.
ewwww
Nope.
I'd honestly like to think that Motoko and Batau clandestinely counselled him out of crossing the line.
00,10she was diveing in to his brain
Meanwhile: it does not matter you still got ninja'd
mental.... =s
He caught an STD? and he lost his legs from it?
pretty much
Daayuum.
Maybe he lost more.
Well, it was a NASTY STD
Sucks to be you, dude.
into you're pants? :D
fo sho
00,10lost every thing from the belly down
God, this song....
That guy is pathetic. Thanks for reaffirming something we figured out in five minutes lady.
00,10So you all want more of this?
thats how the episode ends i couldnt follow it at all
Go for it.
I didn't know all these good shows existed before bronystate
I would have to say, yes. Yeah, Sumi.
yesh please :D
WAKE UP
i dont give a FUCK!!!
:D
Damn this song.
00,10it was a stand alone ep
YEEAAAH!!
00,10no real impact on the meta story
Bronystate can open your eyes, true. We aren't ENTIRELY about Ponies.
It's kind of a profile of one of many people in this world.
The beauty within the shell.
The shell is also perty!
Kencolt: Amen, brother.
But I still gotta say.

Guess I should go find something resembling breakfast.
/me eats shrimp coctail
Hmmm.
How do you say that french saying?
I ate leftover pizza with honey bbq sauce as my breakfast xD
Bon apetite, Meanwhile?
Invi: the Tachikomas are the comic relief of the whole series. AIs who express far more humans than most cyborgs in the series.
Ihonestly preferred the First GIg OP, and song tho.
can someone give me a basic plot description of this series
Er, express far more humanity than most of the cyborgs in the series.
Plot?
Is that even possible?
PLOT?!
00,10they are an elete team of somthing akin to swat
Kandarihu so they are human simulated AI ?
PLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOTT?!
Wounder woman?
No. Its the Commander.
Oh.. xD
The Major and her amazing "I'm not naked but I might as well be" camo suit.
Ninjazz: in these types of anime giving a plot description is hard but not impossible
shit
Major
Mirror'edge to the extreme
Not without some major thinking first, xmasskills.
im a little pony clippity CLOP clippity CLOP

Although this is a lot less revealing than her usual battlesuit from season 1.
such a TEASE
perfect place to keep stuffs ^^
Sooo harcore.
xD
Dat Railgun
using a coin
No. Their AIs aren't even made to be humanlike. They're "Think Tanks" designed to carry a crew of one, or fight autonomously without a pilot inside. After every deployment, they all synchronize their combat data with each other.
Cloak mode also negates fall damage
O///O
00,10she is a cyborg
anyone else feel the old guy is a perv
00,10that fall is noting\
00,10dem pants

Whoa.
haha xD
Dem perv eyes
But I won't tell you where it is
Pervert lol
boobs- good place to put additional hardware
http://derpy.me/O36yx
Hat is it under your hat
One does not simply look away from the boobs.
:O
Batau loved them like crazy, and singled out one of them as his "personal" tachikoma and gave it natural oil instead of synthetic oil. This eventually caused normally disconnected parts of it's AI to become connected, and it became self-aware. When it synchronized it's data with the other, they all became self-aware.
Phase4: Double Bass Cannon is ganna be OP as hell!
00,10long story short he's holding a pervert party
After that, they'd spend every day in the hanger discussing at length the nature of the meaning of life and death.
pervert party is best party
Plot.
Oh god... this guy
00,10he's horny for love dolls
Giggity
haha xD
Well, considering what Major looks like.. Can't really blame the guy.

Pretending to betray your allies is certainly double dealing. But pretending to lose or die, that's a bit less treacherous.
The Japanese often write EDs in English-- it's cool.

/me rolls over and hugs Invi while wrapped in blankets like an egg roll
Well, Malavolent. My favorite fic just ended. I am about to turn 18 in a few hours. My grades suck. And a whole bunch of other problems.
o.o
Atleast my name was in the credits...
Ninjazz what was the fic
Heart of a Dragon.
I dunno...
First, let me congratulate you in advance :) Second: grades doesn't really matter, your knowledge is more important, though I imagine your parents may not agree on this.
No they do not...
I agree with Malavolent
Ninjazz, dont stress too much dude, 18 may feel old but you got LONG time to worry about age.
Ninjazz: just continue being awesome and everything will be fin
^
Heh. Me being awesome? Yeah right...
But.. but Ninjazz, you are awesome <3
^
-///-
yea Ninja you are awesome
we wuv you Ninjazz
^^
There's no need to be worried about you being 18. I had my 18th birthday two months ago and I still don't feel mature or old at all. :)
^
well actually 1 month here..
You guiz :'(
Oh, hello everypony.:)
/me squeezes Ninjazz
awww
/me hugwubbles Ninjazz :)
hey TheRainbowDash
Ninjazz: And why are you crying?
/me cannot contain all thish wub
moin TheRainbowDash
glomps Ninjazz
Ohai TheRainbowDash
TheRainbowDash good ta see ya
Well, if your grades aren't good, you won't be able to make it into college. But maybe this is a good thing. Young adults who go to college tend to come back brainwashed.
O_O
digletxmas: And as of you too, how are you today?
Well, that takes alot off my mind Kandarihu.
And if you must know TheRainbowDash, I haz problems and everyone is cheering me up.
Kandarihu: that isnt true he can still make it to college just not fancy pancy colleges like hardvard
There are lots of people who didn't get through college, yet they became succesful at their lives.
Ninjazz: What kind of problems are these now?
TheRainbowDash idk the day hasnt even started its 3 am right now but im good
Welp. My favorite fic ended. I am about to turn 18 in a few hours. My grades suck. And a whole bunch other things.
Hello again :>
Ninjazz why are you so worried about turning 18
Ninjazz: Hey, today is your birthday or something?
Responsibilyu, digletxmas.
the fancy pancy universities get all the private projects and research investments...the community colleges can't even afford to send students to scientific conventions in the same state
Responsibilty*
I'm going to bed
TheRainbowDash: Almost. in about 3 hours.
later everypony
Cya tr
just remember Ninjazz, life was never meant to be easy, just need to try and overcome these challenges, learn and grow from them
There are too many college professors who make it their goal in life to widen the generation gap as much as possible. If you go to any college at all, be very careful when you are tempted to abandon the values that your parents raised you on.
Cya tr
d3rb xD life is easy as hell in a industrial country
catcha tr, thanks for the attempted help
lol
I will do that. Both of you, Kandarihu and d3rb.
Lmao!
DEAD
Bye tr! (kisses you)
Ninjazz: Fic complete. Authors notes and all.
Reading of fic*
Ninjazz i guess responsibility can be scary but im sure you can handle it and turnin 18 doesnt make you responible for everything immediatly
Did you see me? :>
Of course :>
I hope so, digletxmas.
you still get some noob protection
except if you act like a jerk
Your responsibility officialy begins by getting kicked out of your parents house. Needless to say, some people are 30 and they're not responsible yet.
Ninjazz: always hope for the best cuz in the end hope is what keeps us going
:)
Ninjazz who cares about responsibility? as long as you don't kill nobody or crush everything it's fine ^^
6_9
*somebody
Ninjazz: Your fic. How long until you might release abit of it? :<
Heh. I don't know... Until I am happy with it.
Good point.
I need to make sure that I actually make sense with it.
Ninjazz: whats your fic about can i read it when its ready???
/me would happily proof-read/edit.
a general liability insurance might be a good idea. just in case. they are cheap. I pay 6€ per month.
What I am trying to do is fill in gaps between the show.
For me about writing that story, I'll get it finished by 5/6, but will have to delay any more stories because of finals.:P
Of course, digletxmas. Its about Pinkie Pie.
Ninjazz let us preread it!
^
:D I can't right now. Its still in like its... 6th revision.
preread all the stories!
Ninjazz: ah well say no more when its ready ill be glad to read it
Ninjazz: Wow, 6th revisions?:D
Yep. :{
:P*
/me says again that he would happily proof-read/edit.
I've been really lazy though.
Ninjazz: More revisions!:[ - Pinkie Pie
Ninjazz: making sense of things is good and important. But understand that there's always going to be something that doesn't make perfect sense, especially to one who is obsessed with reason and logic.
aeiou
True...
I just want to make sure that it would make sense WITHIN the canon.
For my reasons Ninjazz, very cynical and reality touched, I just accept my problems and just fix them.
Ninjazz what in the name of heck makes sense in pinkie pie's world
Oh, you're talking about a fanfic.
TheRainbowDash: o hai
Pinkie Pie can do whatever she want. She's Pinkie.
digletxmas: Something that properly needs to be written.
Hello Shane377! (waves and hugs) How are you today?
I thought you were talking about your rl future.
lol
/me waves back "good"
Nahhh. I'm the kind of person that thinks too far into the future.
not*
/me facehoof
u know whats hard about gt5 trying to pick a car u want to drive for the low end races
Ninjazz thats a good trait
Shane377: Good to hear then. If you ask me, I'm doing just ok. Goddamn finals....:|
sumica has dickshep been a dick latley
lol TheRainbowDash
but i love dickshep
Literary in 15 days Shane377.
Funny that its only around 2k words...
thegt90, just use redbull car on everything :D
TheRainbowDash: lol
low end races for the seasonal events
Ninjazz: For my first fanfic, it would be about 10-15k words, it that a little too much for my first ever story?
Well, diplomacy is the name of this game. It's hard to be a jerk when you're trying to win everyone's favor.
I wonder how hard are these finals in the US. Everyone keeps talking about them.
It's hard to win everyone's favor when you're being a jerk.
TheRainbowDash: Just make sure its interesting to read and nothing should ever "too long"
I'm going back to bed. It's 7am here and I want to get as much sleep as possible in the next 3 to 4 hours. See you guys later this week or whenever I can get on.
Ninjazz: Oh, yeah, hmm, about Rainbow Dash getting into the WonderBolts and her arrogance leaves her dream secluded with her other friends, I'll try to make that interesting the whle way.
Bye AttackWithHugs
Ninjazz: sometimes, you might have to read the not-so-fun and really-long th... oh, you're talking about fics again.
http://static3.fjcdn.com/thumbnails/comments/Rainbow+Dash+3+_b12b45c4cb0d3a48139d90bcd1b4e63f.jpg wow sucha good wallpaper

Cya AttackWithHugs
Yeah, Kandarihu. :D
/me huggles Meanwhile and d3rd and Invi and TheRainbowDash and Ninjazz and the rest of the chat
Time to talk about somethinga a bit more cheerful.
That's something I don't like about ME3 biotics, the pull throw combo causes an explosion instead of the infinitely more fun space cannon effect.
Well, I still have 2 cats left.
Ninjazz i know lets talk about.... wait for it ponies
I miss my cats... :'(
/me crosses fingers and hopes i havent broken what i was fixing
Wait, what is this Bronyquest Fundraiser? Is anypony here participating in it
I can't think of a single original idea for a fic.
I think they've all been used up...
Well it works doesn't it Sumica.
XAX: I got loads of ideas....:D
Dashie... I hope I don't see too much clop from you.
Dat Twilight armour.

http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-bronies-change-everything.jpg
I've called her Lüra earlier ^^
Epicpwntime I think its Mass effect 3
So true Shane377
but there is still that veeeery small chance that it won't happen :P
Based on the pronounciation of lyre, I think Lie-rah would be the technically correct one.
Shane377 dats true
Shane377: Hmm, completely true. Without us, the show may be exitinct already.
mass effect 3 huh? maybe i should take a look on wikipedia and see.
We must be very proud of ourselfs
indeedn Meanwhile, but let's ask google ^^
Shane377: i dont even think there would be a season 2
/me taps on shoulder
A dead guy is you!
Meanwhile: In my country, Lyre is Lyra, so I pronounce it that way I pronounce the musical instrument.
And how do you pronounce the instrument?
Also, the more you say Lyra, the wierder it gets 6_9
In-stru-ment
6_9
O u.
Do i deserve a cookie now?
/me hands Frank a biscuit.
Alright silly filles, sorry that I have to go right now. Bye everypony, and I hope to see you here later today.:
:)
it is officially to pronounce Lyra as: [lahy-ruh]
Bye TheRainbowDash.
Oh thanks Meanwhile

BRAINSSS
:[
http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/lyra

Invi: Im so rebel I don't pronounce it the way government want us to.
Meanwhile wait!
Which server?!
Which realm?
Which Race?
Which Faction?!
TELL ME
Dat kick.
Which game?
Malavolent it's not the government, its the international community.

*Kick*
lol
Steamwheedle Cartel, Night Elf, Alliance, Rogue, 85, High end raiding.
Invi: I was just kidding, english pronounciation is weird sometimes.
Puh
Alliance
Good luck anyways
Malavolent every pronounciation seems weird sometimes
im to quik to inlude "cs"
Tell it to my Saviour of Azeroth title you goblin.
Blood elf

what happens if you scan Sumi?
Can't tell if fake or real tbh :l
epic spaceship battles?
It's quite abit of effort to make a fake trailer like THAT
looks safe...almost 10% left
I've never played Black Ops though. So I have no idea :p
oh. nice ^^
...
God Bless Treyarch
It looks like Syndicate with Battlefield.
fight, coward!
Gotta say... Looks better than MW3 already
Ninjazz: All dem vechiles in the trailer :o
And Treyarch always makes better stories than IW... So yeah... Might be good.
God that noise is terrifying
XAX: IKR. IT IS IN THE REAL FUTURE

But... I usually get excited for CoD games but get very very disappointed later on.

WOODS! : D
But that still doesn't change the fact that Treyarch actually manages to make good story line and a decent multiplayer experience.
Decent, mind you.
I've never played the tryarch cods
bleh, dat spelling
Don't play CoD 3.
a futuristic COD?
:O
Yay for easy exams!
Yeah. Way more futuristic than MW3.

I was one so its easier for me.
whats the best ponieh episode to show a friend

From General to King in one day,
Hmmm.
I would say Swarm of the Century
s2e3 is good
But some of the fan vids we made are good too.
but alot of the fan stuff you only get if you've seen the show, epic cupcake time is an excewption though

It kinda sucks that Shep has been trying to warn everyone since the beginning. And now that he has been vindicated. He STILL has to do all the work.
Well, they certainly have the largest set of huge b- no

Ingwaz, welcome.
Hello Ingwaz.

hello Twi_Fi
Green magic = evilz
WHO GOES THERE?!

AWW
00,10Flutershy just flashed Twi
we watching the finale again?
THEIR DEAD
LOL
Mica
ofna01: Yeah, but I mean if they have to actively raise the Moon and Sun, if it's something happening just by them willing it without performing a spell. I haven't even decided on whether or not they "magnetically" shove each other away, and if so, how eclipses work!
I must know!
uh
Kammerjunk: Leave it up to the fanon to fill in the gaps.
Tl:dr : Magnets, how do they work.
00,10you are asuming there are eclipses
Ninjazz: I AM THE FANON!
Kammerjunk: its magic, magic doesnt give a crap about what you want to know. it doesnt have to explain itself
Spike
OBJECTION!
I OBJECT!

Here comes Siblings.mp4
Ingwaz, but consistency is a mark of a good magic system
rapeface
Dem Derpy eyes.
you know... something should have clicked
Celestia is just like Wut
http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_liwvb3yfZp1qdgu7s.jpg
Gotta love Twi's rape face.
serious pony face
00,10So does twi have a reputation of lieing?
bluff skill level 23
Sumica: No.
Nope.
nope
Twilight, calling the best foalsitter of all of foalsitter history EVER being evil should have ... sent up some sort of warning :)
How is using magic not casting spells?
But she has been known to jump the gun before, Sumica.
:(
No, but Twi does have a reputation for overreacting.
00,10and yet none of her friends and family even considder her concerns at all
Not even Celestia. So much for protegé.
Celestia especially...
ikr
Weddings bring out the worse in ponies.
she sat there like a beaten dog
Her words hurt like hell for some reason.
Trollestia much?
Ninjazz: I know, right.
but she said at the start how annoyed she was at her brother for not telling her
oh this part gives me shivers
so maybe they all thought she was just jealous
And then goes and makes me cry... dat face she makes...
still... calling her most favorite foalsitter and possibly the 5th most respected pony in Twi's foalhood as an evil soulsucking demon is kinda.... much ... even for Twi :)
Ingwaz, well, if it is inconsistent it just leads to a world where any random thing can happen at any time without any explanation. That is detrimental to good storytelling.
and now the awesome part starts
WAT
agree...but then again, its easy enough for people to not see something when theyre particularly involved in something. plus, they did not know cadance as twilight did, so they have nothing to base their opinion on either. they were probably just trying to love and tolerate her even if she was being a bit difficult, she is the bride after all
ssssgh
:O
Here comes the Disney...

Everypony should have called upon the sea ponies.
00,10hey dont dis my people
ofna01: So... Did you look at Cadence's magic colour?
Sumi,do the next part please!
Sea ponies are awesome
Still Twilight was overprotective towards Shining Armor. You know... calling Cadence evil. That was just a random throw.
They are just blind still, Sumica.
G4 needs more sea ponies
Soon.
i wonder who thought this up...
i wont be able to do anything else if you just leave it at that
i really do
Soon...

Eyup.

Are we watching part 2?
Yup.

i'm kind of surprised twilight didnt just blast her...but that would make for a bad story...
Likely story, Mark
this is so cute but so sad...

This part... :'(
Ingwaz: that's what fanfictions are for :)

Cadence is a POW.

i think smile smile smile rated just slightly higher on EQD poll for favorite song of the season
<3 this song
O___O
^_^ LOVE those eyes!
no it's other way around Ingwaz
I am still learning the high parts in this song.
I like the cadence thing they did in this song.
Ingwaz, if every pony was like Pinkie Pie in a world of discord, that humor would fall flat.
:|
RainbowAsh: indeed, but when pinkie is around, you can't count on anything to be constant
go play pokemon
Kinda hurts to have a guys sometimes.

I kind of fought her twice in a day accidentally
So yeah... I have a dude's voice.
Ninjazz: What range are you?
Mylittlefailure:Pleaseignoremedia
Ninjazz: LIES!
No idea. I just speak.
Ninjazz: secrets and lies, its all secrets and lies
00,10love CMC's in this, they look so cute
>:|
and then 6 minuts of commercials!
But people have told me that I have an amazing voice. Singing and speaking.
Won the first time, went and healed my Pokémon, went to talk to her again, pressed A too fast, suddenly another battle with her
And I won both times
Sumica: cmc are always cute. particularly scoots
And yes, the CMCs were incredibly DAAAAAAWWW
:O
zombies!!!
Amazing voice, eh?
inb4 zombie ponies
y u no use teleportation again
Ninjazz: People can barely understand my voice because it's "just a rumble to [them]". And I sing like manure.
OBJECTION!
Kammerjunk: Yet, you type like an angel..
I could sing... I choose not to ^///^
LemonJuice: that would have been pure win
I type like a sdfgasg
*gasp*
MAgic
You ponies could have used teleportation
sfdgasg is the new asdf.
LAWL
ofna01: Look at Cadence's magic colour.
its green
i know
you know...i just thought...that bouquet was probably thrown to their death
Chrysalis!
yes
INB4 best pony.
Ready for the new best villain?
:O

/me fangirl squeal
00,10A ponys magic colr matches their cutiemark.
Hmmm.
:'(
That's right...
I was going to request a wetmane Chrysalis, but what's the point?
Does changelings have cutiemarks?
But Chrysalis doesnt have one?
evil fillys have a reverb in their voice...
Jim: No.
nope
:O
Assuming direct controll
And btw. That is Trixie's VA.
Time for epic fight! Go Celestia!
Ninjazz: Yup. So Trixie was in the final anyway!
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-17924190
mfw
ORLLY?
Though - reminder to self - when using Lucario against her Lucario, use Close Combat to down it.
Yep.
Sumica: i suspect its more along the lines of it matches the central color of the cutie mark
00,10I never said main color
dat Celestia fail
>YFW Trixie was Chrysalis in disguise.
So Trixie fans get something...
00,10just the color matches
GOOOO CELESTIA!
No love for Gilda :/
Celestia wins,=!
WAT
Sumica: indeed, i'm just attempting to further clarify to see if its correct. which it seems to be
and this is how celestia died
:O
dat slomo
damn.
I gated this part.
IMPOSSIBRU!

Holy shit bucks

*swish*
Thats not a kiss
it never happened
i misssed the supposed "smooch" sound
don't get your hopes up
it's a kiss. it even has the sound affect
Hello everypony. :)
effect
It's no kiss sadly, we analyzed the scene with great detail.
it is inevitable, mr. anderson..
I have been frame by framing it so many times.
FAKE
00,10negitiv
hai PinkiePry
It's just a sound effect.
lol
Hey PinkiePry.
Her face never touches Fluttershy's.
!:D
inb4 party cannon canon :)
no kiss, freeze frame it, youll see it doesnt happen
00,10dash was smileing the whole time and sound came after they seprated
PArty cannon as a weapon?
Buts its odd aint it?
AWESOME!
If in human world, it's called humanity, is it called ponity in this pony world?
Twilight cannon is canon.
Well, Twilight is now Cannon.
Can I say it?
no
oh noes
HAX
go on Litwick
But humanity sounds better Simon :P
mildy awkward way to wake up
ZERG RUSH!
Ninjazz: I see what you did there. ._.
GG
mighty-pumpkin: so you prefer human over pony huh?
.-.
my ears
Wow, They actually had to hold Dash by herself.
that voice
I wonder, even if the mane 6 got to the door that houses the elements, how would they retrieve them if the door could only be unlocked by Celestia?
00,10oh the poligmay?
send away all the guards....
dat weak apology
and no Simon
don't be silly simon
Cypresswolf: twi can probably unlock it too
Ehhh Twilight is used to it by now.
dat Whooves
Cypresswolf: Oh, that wasn't Celestia unlocking it. It was just Celestia x keyhole.
The Great and Powerful Cheysalis!
also this episode I learnt that applejack has hat space
Such a good voice.
mighty-pumpkin : fuck you I do what I want
looks like cadence can only use heart magic
AJ has always hat magic hat powers
00,10all ponys have mallet space
Daaaw
had*
Cypresswolf, maybe security measures were revamped after Discord was easily able to steal the elements.
In Return of Harmony 1 - Celestia says only she knows the spell that unlocks that door
And its Hammerspace
Dat love power/
Love saves the day
:(
Cypresswolf: Well, yeah. She didn't want the Mane 6 to know of her affair with the keyhole.
was that Doc whooves?
yep
:D
dat love
queue Power of Love son
Cypresswolf: they likely updated it so Twi can get in
And by Meanwhile's sources, Shining Armor is also Braeburn's VA
*song
ummm
Ninjazz: Stupid, sexy Shining Armor.
They share the same VA
Ninjazz but there's no hammer! *empathic arm flail*

Cadence is now best princesss.
Ninjazz: wha? she didnt even apologize.
I still don't like Pinkie Pie
Serriously.

twilight_sprinkle: Implied.
:O
dem singing birds
00,10more CMC dawwwww
daww
Ninjazz: implied is weak, she should have at least said sorry
twilight_sprinkle: Who says she didn't?
Only Applejack apologised, didn't she?
Simon2: well, she'll still try to be your friend
My is a chicken droping flowers
?
Im out as soon as this is over...can't stall much longer
On-screen, that is.
I like your sister, let's marry!

Dammit, now I can hear the braeburn in his voice!
i dont get this moment

Stupid sexy Shining Armor
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjRvkPazwAI
that scrunch face :)
Oh come on. Serriously? Hate on her for not appologizing? Give her a god damn break.
twilight_sprinkle: Rarity probably didn't want her putting her hat on.
celestia is a priest?
how do other ponys get married?
She is the "goddess"
if they dont have horns....
She's as official as one can get
derpy_pony: She's a Princess. She can do whatever the hay she wants.
hoof rings?
anyway even if celestia did apologize, she still sucks
00,10kinda like the captan of a ship
ear rings maybe?
What Susu said.
twilight_sprinkle: Right...
A lesson to be learned.
go dash go!
YEAAAH
anklets? or maybe hooflets?

PinkiePry: stop ruining the joke
damn you lag
I DEMAND IT
ofna01: They're magenta or something.
Ninjazz: at least luna doesnt act high and mighty
All considered, Twilight's case against deceptive Cadence was weak. Shining's explanations held up. Twilight was just incredibly lucky that she really was evil.
you will for a second or so
Did I just hear that love is blue? wat
twilight_sprinkle: What does that mean?
just a split second tough
:$
Love is in bloom
Fuck you lag
Ninjazz: That boy needs therapy?
YES
Season 3 - Applejack sings! She's the only one who hasnt yet
Kammerjunk: He sure does..
dat face
The Element of Generosity....
i thought Lyra wuld catch it XD
Everyone please look at RainbowAsh's comment.
HEY FLARE. COLGATE GOT THE BOUQUET.
Kammerjunk, someone argued that they are actually are reddish, because you have to take the blue tint of the whole scene into account
Just shutup and think for five seconds and read it.
twilight_sprinkle Are we even talking about the same Celestia?
bit late spike!
And then Rarity married Applejack.
Spike,thats supposed to be BEFORE the wedding....
THE END!
I see someone supports RariJack.
/me facehofs
Spike is a slowpoke
RainbowAsh: Fair 'nuff.
Well, he is a BABY dragon
Ninjazz: what about trust?
The greatest episode in My Little Pony series so far
next ep? oh wait.....sigh
pony bachelor parties, how do they work, ponies are (generally) already naked :)
Spike will have one in Shining's honor
YES!!!!!
?
Ninjazz: they couldve not bitched at Twilight who was just doing a good thing
Best song
Who supports RariJack?
twilight_sprinkle: Twilight has been known to jump the gun. Celestia should know this.
d3rb: :(
RyunosukeKnT: use your imagination
I support nothing!
/me flips over table
twilight_sprinkle: Its a wedding. Twilight was giving off the sense of being jealous.
that yellow pony look like twi to anyone else?
<_<
I'd say "Dat heil", but it's probably been said.
>_>
xD
twilight_sprinkle: Remember the beginning? She was pissed off already.

pinkie arrow
Ugh, not that video again. :/
Yup, killing people. Pinkie's perfect role
LOL
Work time!
Ninjazz: good intentions, but nobody cared, and barely apologized
Goodbye.
pinkie,Y U SO BRUTAL?
Wait, mini-Pinkies as weapons and arrows?
Not sure if like.
twilight_sprinkle: Could you blame them? We knew from the start. But no pony else.
eeyup
yep :D
twilight_sprinkle: All this a god damn apology?
its the best xD
LOL

Can't you stream shed.mov instead? It's clearly the lesser evil.

Nopony likes a party pooper.

I prefer brony's singing over Pinkie's singing
O_O

twilight_sprinkle: Please don't take this the wrong way, man. But please get over it. Details, details.
This video is too well made to hate.
damn pinkie
could they have for what ever crazy reason mean that

This and hearing it during tf2 with giblets everywhere only makes me associate this song with some sadistic thoughts now

MORNIN VINYL!
damn neighbors with their damn dubstep
Ninjazz: I agree. I like Luna more because I do, but excluding all the fanon representations of her, I still think Celestia's awesome.
Dat interview.

Thank you, Kammerjunk.

WUBUBUWBUBUBUWBUWBUWBUBWUBUWBUWBUBUBW
wubwub
And Vinyl is Nowacking.
:(
makes me sad
Vinyl is awesome, no doubt about it.
Is This real life?
O_O
Dat mugsmash.
I mean, obviously Luna is better because... Well, she actually gets SOME character develoment. But what does Celestia get? Memes. Bad ones too.
Or is this just fantasy?
Vinyl reminds me of myself
Ninjazz: memes are memes, theyre just jokes.
i like to jam my music
twilight_sprinkle: Tell that to the rest of the fanon.
IM BACK
Ninjazz: I hate it how Luna is more popular then AJ
wb ghos
mighty-pumpkin: And I hate how everypony is more popular than Rarity :/
CHALLENGE ACCEPTED
wat
DAMN
Ninjazz: nobody takes them seriously. thats a petty reason to think she needs more love
lol
:(
twilight_sprinkle: Oh, you would be surprised.
my vid is lagging
Rarity is like... second best pony in poles
cumcakes?
Ninjazz: I think AJ is the least popular of the mane 6 sadly
lol
Vinyl saved Octavia from that guy
lol
LOL
Ninjazz: yeah, the rest 4 of the mane six
dat apple
Yeah, screw the iPhone.
She is... Unforutately.
RX-78-SweetieBot, really?
eeyup
Not in my book.
Wait Wait Wait. Rarity is rising in rank?
but whatever I like Luna still
Oh hi, Discord.

FRIENDSHIP IS DELICIOUS
;-;
is it weird that i like Vinyl as much as any of the mane 6?
:'(
I love Vinyl now.
In most polls I see RD as most popular, followed by either twi or pinkie for second, then fluttershy, then rarity, then AJ
ofna01: Not at all. Vinyl is awesome.
ofna01, yes
Never did before this.
D:
ofna01, nah, I guess it's cool.
noooeesssss
Where can I find tutorials for making dubstep?
RX-78-SweetieBot: Oo RD most popular? when was that
she might be my 2nd favorite pony
RX-78-SweetieBot: Sound about right.
Vinyl is unquestionably, even objectively awesome.
RX-78-SweetieBot: nowadays its twi usually
she has the D'aww factor going for her
True.
