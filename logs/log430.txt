6never heard of it
03:P
02lmao
03but
03the songs are stored as instrumental+acapella
02never heard of it either
03>Rare rap instrumentals
6ah
03well worth the $1 I paid
ikr
03they had all 3 versions, Xbox 360/Wii/PS3 for $1
http://derpy.me/EGJcS
03so I got the 360/PS3 as ew Wii, that's not going to help get good quality rips at all
LIKE A BOSS
03but if you go into practice mode, you can just say "vocals off" and play the entire song instrumental. xD
03Exactly
gotta do my homework D:
03Rock Band was fun on the Wii, but only because of homebrew
03that lets you add custom songs
I think funnyjunk is an unreliable site to link from.
i still own it
03in terms of audio quality it's terrible
Tends to link just to homepage.
homework is overrated
just drop out
Bowl over
02Didn't know the wii had bad audio quality too
03that's the thing
03I think it can output CD-quality (as in, 44.1kHz)
FAP FAP FAP
no
03even games lik Brawl
03are 32kHz
10x9=90
dat math
3oh gog...
3Diod you see that? o.o
slick
http://img.ponibooru.org/images/d0/d06fa0e95ee2c334db599e5e5ec0283c
Hi everypony.
11,01Nope.
02the 3DS has pretty good audio quality. (I've plugged it into my speakers before through the headphone jack)
11,01I'm still working on my thesis work. I'm taking it to a publication.

DAMMIT !
11,01I need to optimize a very slow program.
03I'm going to bet it's not 44.1

11,02http://macromeme.com/cat/diglet-tooth-wut.jpg
03like, difference between an 8-bit bitmap and a 24-bit one
03:P
It also had the best controller
03CDs are 44.1kHz, DVDs are 48
11,02O.O
03crappy web streams are usually 22 or less
/me runs
wat
02ah

Shamroc:it doesn't to me...
02are Blu-rays more than DVDs?

*minigame
03Sony is stupid like that
WTF is with Dk's face
Why does DK have to be the victim of the face lift?
I really wanna play some Donkey Kong 64 now.....
03that's one reason I wanted HD-DVD to win the format war, it was an open format
...thanks...even thou you wanted to sacrafise me not more then 5 minutes ago

03Wii is weird
!HAX HAX HAX!
03as it uses DVDs, but they aren't *called* DVDs
heheh
Too many exclamation points!
03>_>|
03but format wise they're the same thing
D:
ding ding ding ding ding
03they don't though

*Go
03they just steal the technology and rename it
03:P
Honestly, the only bad thing about Katawa is that you have sex with disabled girls
3Mommy died :<
And thats gross
:(
Nuuuuuu
3or at least lost all her coins >>
03But, in order to call something a "DVD", technically, you have to pay to use the trademark
03as the DVD logo has a little ® after it
03>_>
Always
thingy
yeah
3Mother is Peach
I knew it WEE GEE!
03which is probably the main reason the Wii can't play DVD videos
i do dry-bones when able..
Gotcha, thank you.
03or else they'd be sued for using the format without paying
02yeah
waluigi
Silly Peach :3

03Beautiful Katamari is 360 only

03LOL
03well
03like I said
03each one is exclusive to that system
Peach wins XD
12^
03so it has nothing to do with "lazy developers"
03I just prefer BK because it doesn't start with crappy graphics
12none of the Katamari games are cross-platofrm
03Supposedly in KF you can unlock them

You remember when she decommissioned them because she was afraid their growing individualities would make them unsuitable as weapons? She was right. They're not here as weapons but as soldiers.

Sooo harcore.
xD
Dat Railgun
using a coin
No. Their AIs aren't even made to be humanlike. They're "Think Tanks" designed to carry a crew of one, or fight autonomously without a pilot inside. After every deployment, they all synchronize their combat data with each other.
Cloak mode also negates fall damage
O///O
00,10she is a cyborg
00,10that fall is noting\
00,10dem pants
constantley watching her chest,,,
Whoa.
haha xD
Dem perv eyes
But I won't tell you where it is
boobs- good place to put additional hardware
http://derpy.me/O36yx
One does not simply look away from the boobs.
:O
Batau loved them like crazy, and singled out one of them as his "personal" tachikoma and gave it natural oil instead of synthetic oil. This eventually caused normally disconnected parts of it's AI to become connected, and it became self-aware. When it synchronized it's data with the other, they all became self-aware.
Plot.
Giggity
haha xD
yup
00,10it's not just her
