I got TF2 with the Orange Box, but still never played it >_>
TheRandomkid321: Why?
And I got the orange box since it first came out
when* it first came out
I bought the orange.box.for ps3
OtakuTom: It's fun! :D
Then as soon as i heard TF2 went f2p i went and download it
plot demands a victim
This just turned VERY VERY GRIMDARK
I bought the orange box for PC and got Portal 2 for PS3 it came with a code to give me a free PC version :)
I'm turning it into a youtube series soon where I'll undoubtedly fail at playing the game (I suck at FPS games)
BTW TheRandomkid321 did I add you on Steam?
I just bought baby maket xtreme 2

Today sucked at work, I didnt get anything done. And I get paid by units instead of hours so... And today was the day I set aside to remodel my room. I got a wall mount from my brother like a week ago and I figured that today would be the day I move my TV center out of my room. I trashed my room, drilled holes looking for the studs, and in the end, the wall mount ended up being to small for my tv. Worst of all, its late so there

Whoa,Mario Party?
Mario party gets worse every year
Best mario party is.4
Well you can build your own ponyville
11,02This is actually the best Mario Party game that's come out in a while
I think 2 is best Mario Party
00,02luigi is best player
The series died on number 6
11,02And yes, Mario Party 4 was the best :3
XD hi every 1
I leave for 2 minutes to go potty and you guys have already gone all mario in here
11,02The series died on 5
11,02Hai Dark_of_Max :3
cachi01|mobile: They tried to make a change :\
Phase4 Heck yeah!
Hello Dark_of_Max
I'm sorry, SB, but I have to greatly disagree with you. I thought 9 was the single worst Mario Party game ever.
C:
Now fortune street
Thats a piece of
hi SuperBrony64
CRAP
OH I know what this is. Its "Luigi wins by doing absoulutely nothing" !
lol
I just wished you had the normal stars instead of "mini stars"
Troll Card
Chat is ded :(
11,025 was the worst Mario Party game.
hey Ponies47
Well I just gave a TF2 F2Per their first hat...
5 was meh
Hey oni_link
3I really loved 5 :<
I think 8 was the worst
what just happed there
Ponies47: how ya been?
38 is the worst
i just it was 11:34 i fell sleep and is now 2:04 XD
Also I'm not sure how the game will be but it is coming out this year. Gameloft refuses to reveal details and hasbro is giving them license thor the creation as well as helping them create the game
5 was the first mario party I got :(
3eight is the worst imo
I feel like I have commited a crime of sorts...
Weegee wins by doing absolutley nothing
oni_link: Good thank you. You? :3
3I enjoyed my time with 5
3I did not enjoy my time with 8
5 was fun
I ahve played the original mario party
I had a ton of fun playing 8.
13vivi ist not worst :<<<
00,02SlurryMoon, dat colour script
/me sees title... ooooooooh
Guys, guys. Its LITERALLY Luigi wins by doing absolutely nothing, its a youtube series :D
3nothing I can do to fix that problem Phase4
5 had 3 special games
3Unless there is
00,02SlurryMoon, there is
3No one has told me
00,02depends on how your colouring though
Which i had shitload.of fun with them
Wait whos streaming?
00,021 mine handles numbers just fine :P
What is the difference between + and @?
Ponies47: Ah, well today could have been better but it all good now that Im comfy cozy and on Bronystate :P
+ is.voice
SuperBrony64: thats you in the middle right?
@ is.mod
oni_link: Goodie ^^
I really hated 9, 'cause I felt the minigames were bad, plus the change to how you navigate the board. It no longer has that "board game" feel it used to have, which is where it really excelled in the past.
00,02"* SlurryMoon has quit (Excess Flood)" and this is why we dont copy paste scripts via irc :P
Who is sttreaming?
3but I like to
Lol
11,02Spectrum_Rush|: Yesh
Ponies47: i dont wanna go to work tomorrow
Dont go
Get some beer
Just trying to unlock the extra boards and characters in 9 is a huge pain in the butt, to the point where I never finished it. I got screwed over so many times by the "random" numbers that I was repeating boards constantly due to a single roll.
Burn your pants
/me Hugs oni_link "It will be ok"

Bye Dovah
Ponies47: I wish you the best XD
Dat sign
Ponies47: which reminds me, what is the brony shirt? rainbow dash? :s
oni_link: This is gonna be FUN. :3
Ponies47: hahaha i know!
Chrysalis, I'm getting a laptop with Windows 7, 1TB hard drive, 8GB RAM, Nvidia GeForce GTX 660M graphics, and 17 inch 1920x1080 display for $1,200. That's comparable to my current gaming rig and will cost me LESS.
noname: It just says BRONY and has Rainbow Dash is on it. She's just black I think it's like her shadow or somthing. The only that has colors is her cutie mark but I like it ^^
and how olds the rig
Including bluray drive. Forgot to mention that, too.
Less than a year old.
OtakuTom: Wow
Ponies47: i've seen it before, somewhere, it looks cool :)
noname: Got mine at Hottopic also got a DJ PON-3 shirt and brony wristband :P
ooh yeah you heard how were fucking up the olympics already?
https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/7/25/o-bBEcngZ0eIQ9GBkS8Uvw2.jpg
Chrysalis: Yep saw it in the news today
http://cheezburger.com/6411160576
Am I missing something in the pic that Chrysalis just linked?
OtakuTom thats a north korrean footballer
05i dont get it Chrysalis...
Ah
next to a south korrean flag
05oh
they refused to play
05tough luck
Yea, once you said North Korean, I understood the mistake :P
/me Chrysalis joke --> my head V
hmm http://cheezburger.com/6453349888
what happens if you take an opening ceremony
and throw up british
I don't know. I think the report that security is supposedly supposed to prevent access to anyone wearing clothing advertising products that compete with the sponsors was pretty bad...
OtakuTom theyv been doing that at wimboldon for YEARS
Ok for real I'm going to bed now. But before I go you may say your goodnights and tell me a bed time story :P
Ponies47: haha, night, hope you have a fun day tomorrow :)
Oh I will :P
Ponies47: There was once a lad who had a brother who he very much disliked his brother. He made it his life goal to be a sucess and never have to take any of his crap anymore. That kid is you. goodnight. :)
Wrek: who's currently playing?
I wasn't aware of that happening at Wimbledon. I think that's kinda crazy. Someone wearing a Pepsi shirt where Coke is a primary sponsor doesn't detract from Coke getting all their normal advertising (using Coke as an example since they're a sponsor for the Olympics)
lol dat repeat
oni_link: :3
but youre gonna go far kid :D
05Spectrum_Rush|: sabaton
Spectrum_Rush|: Sabaton
danke Wrek OtakuTom :)
oni_link: is there a conclusion to that story? whats gonna happen to the brother? The suspence is killing me.
http://cheezburger.com/6402008832

i like redheads
>My life sucks > 3 girls want to date me > Does not compute
Malmortius: is there a redhead amongst these 3?

Oh, I didn't notice that in the first image.
The RAM fairty visited you

TheGreatAndPowerfulT send the rest my way
Wrek don't have one for myself, talking about what Malmortius said
OtakuTom: yeah that is what got my jimmes rustled

it aint any less plausible than god lolo
05i only heard 3 girls
heres why desktops are awesom ehttp://theadmin.co.uk/img/ZldeWR.png
Either way, your card still meets requirements.
although, its reading my gpu mem wrong, i have more than that
Wrek [03:21] <Malmortius> i hate my life right now, sucks so bad. 3 girls wanna date me but i dont know which one to choose
OtakuTom: Yeah it does. but Im confused o.o
If I had the new laptop, I'd outperform that. I'll still outperform it once I get to my gaming desktop, Chrysalis :P
Chrysalis: I cant see it
OtakuTom youd outperform a 5.9ghz overclock
on a quadcore
I haven't overclocked, but I have a quadcore
OtakuTom i don't trust systemreq, everytime i run a scan it says that i'm using xp :p
id watch it http://cheezburger.com/6377433088
I wonder what it would say on this laptop (running Linux Mint)
also, i have decent cooling in my rig
youll never get that in a laptop
05sweden: where most of the hardcore heavy metal bands are gay
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: That might explain why it says I have 869.5 MB when I have 256MB :D
05xD
Wrek: lmao
it says i have 751 i have 2048
Wrek cani move to sweden ?
Chrysalis: is there a better site? hahaha
CPU power isn't everything, Chrysalis. I've got a cooling system in my desktop that would allow me to overclock my quadcore to 4.0 Ghz safely, but I just haven't done it.
though ram wise, it says i have 8.2gb somehow?
OtakuTom look at my gpu specs then
but realise its a 2gb card not a 768
Yea, I have a Nvidia GeForce GTX 670, what's the big deal?
oni_link the page gives you an idea but never trust it completly
you get those specs in a laptop they catch fire
or crash in under a minute due to overheating
Yea, which is exactly why the gaming rig I'm getting has exactly that...
though i should actually replace my cooling system
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: lmao yeah this isnt gonna be my primary pc anyways, im gonna be spending a cool $1200 for the tower
i cant actually play games with my cpu clocked like that
No one streaming? :(
Malmortius: Wrek is streaming
It says offline ;O
Malmortius: yeah wrek is
refresh?
Wrek, you gonna play that dungeon game?
Laptops are more than able to do graphic-heavy applications now. Companies like Nvidia have developed mobile graphics processors and have been using them for years now. I've had no problems playing high-end games even on this laptop, with the only limiting factor being the other hardware.
dungeons of...
grimrock..?
http://cheezburger.com/6375284992
i think its called that
Malmortius legend of grimrock
yeah but a) they run hot reducing the overall life of the chips
b) theyre still slower than the desktops and have to run at reduced settings
thegt90: this needs to happen
yes
Aw hell yea! Primo Victoria!
My name is pinkie pie, and i am here to say! Im gonna make you cum all night, and i will make you gaaayyy!
It doesnt matter now!
If you are sad or blue
i guess he left his computer unattended
/me jumps
Malmortius: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/6212/
Chrysalis, I've been using this laptop for 3 years with no problems. It's just getting outdated. I've been able to play everything from Minecraft to Diablo III with no overheating and no slowdown aside from the limits of the older hardware.
at what settings
the one they come with
or can you turn em up
Again...this laptop is older now, so I had to use reduced settings. It only has 4 GB of RAM and and 4-year-old graphics processor. Plus, the display is only 1366x768. Once I get the new laptop, I'll be able to play at much higher settings at 1920x1080 with no problems, and I'm sure of it.
you know what, this is a redundant argument overall
pc > laptops > consoles > poo > mobiles
PC are still the master race
but laptops are better than any of the consoles
I wasn't trying to say that they weren't. I was just trying to point out that laptop's aren't bad (at least anymore)
Chrysalis: I think mobiles are better than poo and yes, PC is on top
Oh, yeah. FUN FACT: The MLP:FiM intro song is 95 syllables long.
and nintendo staying behind the times as usuall means the wiiu is only just catching up to 360/ps3
i miss the days when nintendo did stuff original
I still use my desktop almost exclusively at home unless I have company over.
/me crosses fingers for 40:1
Chrysalis: yeah but theyve always been about software
nintendo lost me the moment i saw the wii controler
oni_link which is just as unoriginal nowadays
mariokart 7
mario is getting old
and has never gotten any good
oooh fireworks
Chrysalis: Well yeah, nothing topped SM64 but idk Zelda is alright
euch, i dont like zelda
Super Mario Galaxy and Galaxy 2 were great. New Super Mario Bros was also a great return to 2D. The franchise that I think really has started to stagnate is Zelda (though I still really love the franchise)
its overrated though
mario is the next sonic bound to die slowly
did he just..
http://cheezburger.com/6363290880
P4ngya yes he did
Chrysalis: ... http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5806/
rofl
Hi! and whats this?
05this is WCH currently showign Sabaton Live :3
oni_link no, i heard it was a really good game, and was severly dissapointed when i played it
They need to do something to breathe new life into the Mario franchise, I agree, but the games are still good. Mario and Zelda both transitioned into 3D well, and Nintendo really cared about the lives of both franchises. Sonic's first couple of 3D games were decent, but then Sega really dropped the ball, and that's really what led to Sonic's downfall.
OtakuTom: Skyward Sword was hit and miss. Im hoping the WiiU game will be good.
Chrysalis: Even the N64 games?
http://cheezburger.com/6358152704
On a side note, if they had made sonic generations minus the "cutscenes and having his annoying friends (excluding tails), it would have been awesome/
i meant "cutscenes
damnit....
05enjoy guys
05its time for the heavy stuff
"cutscenes" there.
I actually haven't heard Therion yet...
Wrek: ooh what is this?
nice set
/me can't hold it
its too heavy
:P

ah thank u
So how do you guys feel about Sonic 4?
i dont know many ibreviations or how to spell that word
I hated Sonic 4
OtakuTom: Just curious but why?
haven't play it
I really would have rather it not be episodic, and have them focus on an actual linear game. I really didn't like the ability to select the stages individually.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: They have demos, try for yourself. I'd like to hear how you feel about it.
http://cheezburger.com/6349964800
05hot opera chicsk 12 o'clock
OtakuTom: Well, it being episodic was kinda cheap but i think the stage select is being a bit nit picky isnt it?
I was excited to the return to 2D, but I just felt like they dropped the ball.
05or if i am to be proper: 2 very fine ladies~
ehh i dunno the only sonic i really miss is sonic adventure 2 and that is for the chao garden
^ ^ ^ ^
I don't really think I'm being nit-picky about it. If they had made it linear instead, they could have really focused on making early stages easier than later stages, forcing the player to improve over the course of the game.
/me shares the same interests as Wrek
OtakuTom: Yeah, it was a bit easier than earlier games. Are you basing all of this off of Ep1, 2 or both though?
I didn't like 1, so I never got 2
http://cheezburger.com/6340208896
Wrek did you finish the robo rarity?
05not yet
OtakuTom: I have yet to get 2, one wasn't bad IMO. A hell of a lot better than the 3D games. 06 left a bad taste in my mouth for all of eternity
thegt90: CANNOT BE UNSEEN D:
i know so want to find that book now
^ ^ ^
4 was really the nail in the coffin for me with Sonic. I really had high hopes for it, but I just plain didn't like it.
http://cheezburger.com/6317276672
http://cheezburger.com/6322845440
05d'aaw
OtakuTom: Thats probably why I actually had fun with it then. I didn't have high hopes. I just wanted it to play good and it did. But they need work still. Far from perfect but not bad. I don't think I'll ever get another 3D Sonic game though. I heard great things about Colors but never got it because I was afraid it would suck. And Unleased drove me away with that fowl "werehog". *shivers*
Story is too thick too...
05the one to the right
05<3
Wrek: totally :3
Yea. The older games, such as Mario and Sonic, really are best with as little story as possible. They need to be just pointlessly fun and simple yet challenging platforming (or whatever genre it was originally made for :P)
http://cheezburger.com/5821911296
05the original point of the story in both sonic and mario was to say "this isthe bad guy at the end"
05when they derrived form that is where it went wrong
05from*
05and yeah
Exactly, Wrek. It just needs to be Mario vs. Bowser or Sonic vs. Robotnik. Nothing more.
OtakuTom: And that isnt so hard. Hi speed, platforming and little to no story. Just imply things, we dont need long, un inspired cutscenes and stories...
05im totally having a crush on her to the right
Wrek: She is soo cute <3 and I totally agree. Bad guy is bad, good guy is good. Good stops bad. That way they have no reason but to focus on making it fun and challenging.
i didnt need that but there at the end. oh well...
actually it belongs there :D
05where is sumica when you need him
http://cheezburger.com/6309625088
Wrek: Sleeping most likely?
05he'd totally dig the brunette aswell :P
thegt90: dat logic
05oni_link: she jsut looks so regal n cute and all xD
05:3
this is one of my faveorite cars and it has this on it so freakin want now http://cheezburger.com/6309221888
oh more concerts , what did i miss so far ?
Wrek: I know, I cant help myself XD
05TrixieMuffin: Sabaton
05and right now Therion
i think id go for the brunette as well
05and after Therion some more avantasia
awww i like sabaton
thegt90: take all my monies! the elise is soo sexy and it being ponified makes it even better
yes and make it red ill love it forever
http://cheezburger.com/6310436864
thegt90: you read my mind :O and rofl at that other pic :D

Wait have you thought of getting a 3d print?

00,02:kickbot

00,02wat
00,02oh yeah
00,02bold 2
00,02:kickbot 6 10
Phase4: Must be op
00,02excelent
you all have kick counters now?
and then drake bell turned into a brony
00,02hmm
00,02not sure which op to ping
TheGreatAndPowerfulT that names familar what stuff has he been in
drake and josh
oh him
the beiberconda
lol ^
hello
hi
It's so quiet here...
/me shouts and screams
better?
:P
O_o
why not?
ancient music again
wacken?
oh Fu... i think i'm lost i need to open my twitter more often ._. i hope tara is trolling
she trolls the bronies all the time
/me checks Twiiter
what did she write?
ehhhh something about beiber being a brony
well, he is a little girl, so technically he belongs to the target audience
lawl that picture as fake
*was
the whole bieber tweet is fake
hrafn...why so sexist?
derpy_pony: I'm just kidding of course :)
didn't mean to offend <3
teenage boys and their bieber...you talk about the guy all the time...
pretending to hate him...as if we wouldn't see what's really going on
00,02Wrek, can you type :kickbot 6 10
i hope so ._. i just can't stand his fan base ._.
what is really going on then?
you are part of his fanbase
you spread the word whenever you can
I have one reason to hate him, And it has nothing to do with he is a person but rather the fact he hardly if not even makes good music
you wouldn't talk about ponies that much
Whom?
do you hate?
killerpony7733: is he your neighbour or something?
derpy_pony to who are you talking to if it's okay to ask ?
no one in particular. except you :P
uhmmm you know sometimes this chat gets weird
when bieber becomes a brony, bronies aren't cool anymore and we go to another fanbase!
derpy_pony: Hah, Hardly i don't live in the US. I just don't like JB's music due extreme overuse of words over and over again more or less repeating them, Even worse he sings about teen love which is to say never good
derpy_pony never said that
hai everyone
00,02Wrek, Ping
Phase4: Wreky is napping
I know, TheGreatAndPowerfulT
hi Thrackerzod
I'm still bored
derpy_pony watch ponies ?
arguing with haters is stupid
seen them all, TheGreatAndPowerfulT
need new ponies
and that's a problem because ?
if you have to ask, then you wouldn't understand
http://ponypic.com/i/hrmRn.jpg
this would make a good pirate song
didn't listen to the text though
yeah
:)
cant wait till movie night
the fat lady has sung yet?
what will we watch this night? die hard and star wars are over
this movie night is gonna be great :)
which one?
never heard of dark crystal
I remember Dark Crystal from when I was very, very young
been wanting to see it again for AGES
you will probably be disappointed
it's not the same anymore
nah, I try to keep an open mind about movies I haven't seen in a long time
hmhm
doesn't work for me :(
Hey everypony
I'm also looking forward to Flash Gordon :P
hi Very_Silly_Filly
I had the wierdest dream last night
retrofuture is best future
Guess I was playing Portal a bit much :P
I love cheesy old sci-fi and horror :3
I dreamed of chess last night...
Basically, I came into a test chamber, was confusing as hell.
But, me being me, I'm armed
:P
haha
i dreamed i was killed by a seraial killer, becasue im normal
6:20 sun is out, Time to sleep
So I pretty much made 2 portals facing turrets
Goodnight/day everyone
Good night TheGreatAndPowerfulT :)
Then I shot them with rocket launchers
good night, TheGreatAndPowerfulT :)
Sleep well
sleep well TheGreatAndPowerfulT
Then I just so happened to of found a pair of gunboats, so Iput them on and rocketjumped to the exit
I went down the elevator and woke up :3
I want portal dreams too
Mine was portal: My way
I had a TF2 related dream a while back :P
I do get the most retarded dreams in the world
But that's only because how screwed up my life is :)
I get the most retarded dreams
what do you mean Underpony
I was back at my old school, and my boyfriend was there for some reason, and he let me stab him so I could disguise as his team, it was all kinds of messed up
you don't even want to know about my dreams XD
I have roughly 2 dreams a week
So I probably won't get any more this week, since I had one on Monday
I have a dream every day
actually, I've read that everyone dreams several times a night, you just don't remember most dreams :3
Hrafn yup excepted i remeber all of them
true ladies have no last name ^^
I haven't dreamt in ages until last night
I've had tons of zombie dreams... probably due to my extreme interest in horror movies and whatnot :P
Then it started to sleet, and I slipped off, fell down and woke up.
this week 50% pony 20% zombie 30% random 20% cool
I presume I woke up because I was killed
that's more than 100% Thrackerzod O.o
Which actually would of been the first fatality in a while
I never dreamed of ponies. It would probably take several hours of massive pony exposure to get such dreams...
ekyps how much more :P
don't know if it's worth it
I've never dreamt of ponies either that I can remember, which is actually a bit odd
wtf is thi
I don't think I had a death until last week since ages ago when I was testing my new weapon which at that point, I hadn't invented
wacken, ninja
I accidently shot and blew up the building near me
was walking away, and it suddenly ended
I *presume* I was hit be debris
derpy_pony: an awesome band or something
what are the NSFW rules here?
This site is 13+
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wacken_Open_Air
LOL
I have no idea who this band is
What does Nsfw stand for ^^?
Underpony: You cannot post explicit material in this channel nor talk about anything
Not safe for work
ah crap!
kk
i accidently uploaded a video to the wrong account
I know what Nsfw is but i dont know the meaning Of those letters
3 hours to put it on the wrong one :(
Underpony: So if you want to you need to find a channel that allows it
not safe for work
I was just wondering, is all
Heya everypony!

Heyup, MaidWhite

Zelda
alexxm: Restarted my iPod quickly
ok then XAX
Shit another bird just flew into my window
lol
did it die?
no
owh
that would have been funny
but it happens at least once a week
Corrupt well at least you have dinner now
any idea why they keep doing that
Zelda
nope
they probably don't understand how windows work Corrupt dont think the window will stop them
but I always thought it would be funny if like, a pigeon flew head-first into a window died
but the shades are down as far as they are concerned it's a wall
idk what the deal is but they have already cracked the glass
Ohai Bronystate! Different computer, and Steam games work! :$
zelda
mora zelda
aww nostream
ZeLdA
hello everypony
!
hello?
anypony?
hey LoGaN how've you been
good i thought i was the only pony here
hi
well mid day in the middle of the week isn't the best time
Phase4: it shat itself
Can't tell if chat is ded or my internet just ded.
00,02AdamTheDuck, ded chat
Holy crap mates. I just saw a guy pretending to be mickey mouse on a TF2 server.
Wow... CHat sure is dead Phase
Phase4: cartridge crashed
So no stream going on?
00,02JRP2234[Web], kinda distracted
And I'm guessing lack of chatting = lack of dtream
IT TOOK A DUMP
lolwut?
who had a shit
00,02Wrek, ping
D:
my zelda cartridge crashed while i was streaming
Well this is... fun... yay...
Ever get Fallout to... well... not crash Phase4?
00,02AdamTheDuck, not yet
That's a pitty
00,02i think new vegas might work
Yeah but New Vegas didn't have the epic moments and story like Fallout 3...
hello dead chat
hi
New Vegas ending was epic
Hey there d3rb. ._
Corrupt, as good as fallout 3 ending?
Corrupt: Then you haven't tried Fallout 3 then...
yes
I beat them both
thats a big call but i might have to buy it and find out
Was it that good? I thought it was too simple.
Fallout 3 had a epic ending too, just a different kind
Never played them myself.
BronyJenkins, do yourself a favour, get fallout 3
In NV I love how all the factions you get on your side come to help you at the end
Will do in future. :/
its pretty good, i doubt youll regret it
As long as it doesn't crash as much as it did with Phase xD
lol yeah, maybe get the physical copy, i never had a problem with mine
Mkay, no money at the mo, but I'll bear it in mind. :3
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqRwFyoGgQ&feature=plcp DO YOU!?
Yes.
i'm sceptical
d3rb good not everone should
I'm going to have to reinstall Fo3
I play consoles... :/
TheRandomkid321: No mods for you :/
i've already played it through 3 times but i wanna play it again after thinking about it
AdamTheDuck I cant install em anyways.
I overdid the mods for fallout 3
Corrupt: Lol who didn;t?
/me has never modded fallout 3 and plays it on pc...
the shame!
haha, modding
For NV I got more perks and perks every level best thing I ever did
wouldnt that just make the game super easy Corrupt ?
^
not if you a good modder
<----
Yeah, I just install the realism mods
a little but a lot of the perks don't do too much
so you can counter the mods by making it harder?
I always beat the game before I go mod crazy
ah good
Corrupt likewise
No. 1 rule, beat game on vanilla or get bored of vanilla before attempting to mod...
so its just screwing around and having a bit of fun with it
yep
Pretty much
poni poni?
pudi pudi?
I have been trying to get one of the mods that let you put your own songs into the radio to work but I can't get it to work
corrupt thats easy
i would have thought that would be one of the easier things to do
My brain just messes up on one part
there's litteraly the radio mp3 file that you can find lol
link?
AFTER A WEEK OF SEARCHING I HAVE FOUND IT AGAIN! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AACPUsgO_e0

though i did it for my xbox
Explode it twice?
fat music stor and an ntfs main store
00,02i did it to install ubuntu
00,02ntfs is a bad idea for solid state
external hdd
00,02but yeah
00,02the guest modules caused a kernel panic
00,02um
Use more duct tape?
00,02actually i think virtualbox crashed
00,02yeah
it would be faster to upload to a remote host and download it
00,02i crashed virtualbox
that go through all this
/me has all the strength of the raging fire
00,02Chrysalis, i need to wipe the partition table
00,02it'd be quicker to reboot to linux
Liokin: It's funny how it's actually true :D

00,02i killed virtualbox
00,02and its still running
00,02wat

Hush now quiet now it's time to lay your sleepy heads

Whoa, what's this song?
08,01so i was visiting my parents
08,01and my mother insisted on making me lunch
08,01she asked what i would like to drink
Apple juice!
AdamTheDuck: its the theme song of the sherlock holmes movies
Apple cider?
08,01and i've been in an exceptionally silly mood all morning
08,01so i almost shouted out "PENIS!"
00,02lets have another go at fallout 3
*yay*
08,01as some of you might know, my mother is a very conservative little old woman, who was brought up in india
Lol and thought the mods were mature adults xD
/me reads up chat
Oh
Never mind :|
08,01shouting this out would not have gone down well
I though*
08,01so i shouted out "MOTHBALLS!" instead
08,01was still not amused
mothballs
08,01but at least it wasn't penis.
._.
o.o
Doesn't feel the same...
Mothballs...
I like apple juice for two reasons
1) It is tasty and refreshing
2) It looks like pee and this amuses me
08,01i brought my ukulele with me
lol.
JARATE
08,01much to the dismay of everyone else
^
00,02wow
00,02that did not last long
Yay?
Lol still at the intro phase?
08,01i was actually banned from taking the ukulele to my best friend's house when i lived in edinburgh
Phase4: 2 steps forward and then crash eh?
^
00,02Spectrum_Rush|, a few to the right as wel
08,01because i kept singing dirty drinking soungs to the tune of, say, Greensleeves...
00,02i'd play mass effect but i just watched star trek
00,02so not in a mass effect mood
00,02want to try kotor but it breaks too
00,02oh

00,02Spectrum_Rush|, i cant remember the title
08,01probably
00,02next generation, a student becomes a q
00,02and de lancie shows up
08,01heh, aparently, i'd "ruined Greensleeves forever for everyone"
00,02it was a good episode
Phase4: True Q is the episode title :)
00,02Spectrum_Rush|, theres an episode on right now actually

Phase4: Speak. Vocalize. Project your vocal language over the stream. Talk aloud.
TheRandomkid321: and what is your weapon?
08,01there's probably a fundub sitting around somewhere
Phase4: I know the feel, Living in a tiny tiny apartment with 3 family members doesn't help

Phase4: The Olol guy. He is the same guy plugging the same bull everytime. And now he says he has a dying friend so he is trying to get minecraft for.
Hello, Underpony
00,02strange
00,02different hostname
Underpony: Sup bro /)
Hi
(\
warm welcome today :3
I do have a friend in hospital dying, who had always wanted minecraft..
00,02Olol, he's advertizing a thing
00,02at least a kick
AttacktheAndalite: It's not a phone. It's an iPod touch.
Olol: He must be a Nigerian prince. Yeah, okay.
How am I advertising?
XAX: I know. :D
Olol: Make a better story next time ya' dick.
Ello All.
Hi, Nephy
Nephy: Sup bro /)
Oh, he's back
Olol: you just posted an add for an app website or something
Just found out about this site.
I just wondered if the brony community would be kind enough to help with this..
Nephy: Sweet, and welcome~
Nephy: Welcome to the herd.
Thank you very much! :D
0,5Olol this isn't an advertising room. It's against our rules, no matter what it's for.
Olol: Your plugging BS in our chat. Why in THE HELL did you think that would just be kool?
0,5Heh, plugging BS in #BS
0,5:3
how you doing Nephy
BaconMane: :3
Liokin, BaconMane: Dat pun /)
It doesent exactly seem like it's a scam link. It's just a referral.
How do you mean "Plugging BS"?
Nephy: Welcome! How's stuff?
I clicked it on my iPod.
I'm doing much better now that i have vacation time.
still against the rules
^
Yeah.
YOU BROKE THE RULES
O.O
MAN
o_O
:3
RUURUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUS
:3
AttacktheAndalite: -lawl /)
the cyber police are gonna backtrace you
0,5Scam, virus, legit, whatever, it's still not allowed.
Query: What does plugging mean? (Newbie to IRC)
EggWhite: Advertising
EggWhite: I love the way you worded that.
Nephy: Welcome to the stream :D
I'm sorry. I just wondered if you would want tot make someone who's sorta half dying a bit happy... I thought the Brony community would have a heart for that (Seeing as they've been kind to me in the past...
EggWhite: are you Data
Oh ok danke Liokin
Thank you :D
*want
dat 2 person net split.
EggWhite: Das ve dania comrade :3
olol ask for help and get people to pm
Wait. YOU CAN PM ON HERE?!?!?!?!?!? O:
Olol: how do we know your not lieing to us to get money its happened to many people before
Nephy: Double click the persons name from the names on the list to the right of the chat.
Nephy: That list of people on the right. Double click a name to open a PM box.
Spectrum_Rush|Sleepy: No misa is is HK-47 from KOTOR
Because I'm a truthful person...
DAMNIT Liokin.
Nice!
Nephy: Or type /query then the persons name you want to talk to
XAX: :3
Liokin: Is ninja
Olol: well i guess if you say your a truthful person...\
Olol: you cant afford minecraft yourself? surely you can afford 27$ for a dying friend
Olol: You want minecraft for your friend so bad? Pirate it
I have barely any money...
Olol: Or download it fro youtube
Thank you all for being so kind. :D
Olol: Its just that simple
lol download it from YouTube
when did minecraft become $27?
XAX: Yeah >:3
Can you really do that?
Olol: I had a self updating pirated copy once so get that if you can't afford it
Olol: get it on xbox or something
MegaMoonShine: Yes! -lol
it only 20$
Because every FREE 100% DOWNLOAD video on YouTube is legitimate.
Wait, you can download Minecraft from YouTube? Whut? That seems impossible.
0,5Olol, truthful or not, it's simply against our rules to advertise it here. If I had a bacon strip for every time someone wanted to spam or advertise here I'd have a truckload of bacon.
^Pretty much
I don't want to do anything illegal
AttacktheAndalite: I did it! >:3
Bacon please
Olol: I don't know who you are, I don't know what you want. If you're looking for money, I can tell you that I don't have any. But what I do have is a very particular set of skills. Skills I have aqcuired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you don't link that again, that will be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not persue you. But if you do, I will look for you, I will find you, a
nd I will tell on you.
Olol: We realized. But read what BaconMane just said.
BaconMane: You forgot those that come in trying to "troll" us
Olol: Well it's your call, Just saying that it's possible to get
Spectrum_Rush|Sleepy dunno i just looked at the official page
Underpony: I laughed.
seems legit
Liokin: Whuuuu?
Underpony: Dat reference
Unerpony: lol
XAX: Thats true. Not everyone has a legit download. But if you want it bad enough you'll find it -lol
Underpony: Dat wall of text
AttacktheAndalite: I can link you to a legit download of a copy if you want it.
:3
What movie is that even from? :S
Liokin: ...it is true that i have found some helpful shit on YouTube.
Hey everypony, managed to cut myself on a latch :/
But what I don't understand is how it's advertising?
MegaMoonShine: Taken
Hey Very_Silly_Filly :)
Liokin: PM me. I don't have to pay for it once I launch it, do I?
twilight_sprinkle: eh me no care really since i already have it 6_9
XAX: So you kinow how easy it is to get something if you REALLY want it.
how'd that happen Very_Silly_Filly
AttacktheAndalite: Not a cent
Sorry Very_Silly_Filly
AttacktheAndalite: Gimme one sec to find the video again.
Olol: if it is asking for money its advertising
Hmm...
Olol: You were asking for money to get minecraft or someone to buy it for you correct?
I remember one time my friend from Maine texted me at like 7 in the morning just to tell me that he had Minecraft. I was like "Dude, are you fucking serious?"
If BaconMane got a bacon strip for the people that have came on here in an attempt to troll, would it be a planet of bacon?
Liokin: Mmmm
alexxm: I was trying to take off one of the top parts of a gun, and it was wedged
EggWhite: More like a small galaxy
So I used a knife to get it off and slit myself with it
EggWhite we don't get that many trolls do w
It's not money.. It gives me a point everytime the link is clicked, I'm on 3 points right now, and a minecraft code is 6 points
0,5EggWhite yes, the size of jupiter
Mmm Jupiter tasty
Bacon? Bleeghh
O.O
^ wut
Olol: http://www.bronystate.net/rules/ i suggest clicking and reading the 4th bullet down
YOU DARE "BLEEGHH" AT BACON?!?!?!?!
Now I have a craving for bacon. Thanks BaconMane :>
0,5heehee
Nephy: I'm vegetarian
Olol: you said you didn't want to do anything illeagal so get a game that is soposed to be payed for is illegal even if you say it is legit youre still breaking the law
I would go and grill some bacon. If it weren't 3am.
And I weren't in bed.
You guys keep me from getting irritated early in the morning. I love you guuuuuuyysss *hugs the chat*
Ahhhhhhhhh
Olol: In the end you are advertising cause it's helping YOU, You are asking people to help YOU get a copy of minecraft through it,
For free is suposed to be there some where
Awwwww :)
/me hugs AttacktheAndalite back
tell Olol why dont you just use a proxy site and click it yourself?
Why bother? Minecraft isn't worth buying anymore
BaconMane: Do you taste like bacon?
*tell me
BEcause I don't know how to.
EggWhite taste hom and find out

Sorry
EggWhite like egg... whites... uh
BaconMane: he'll have a simpler name than that and keep advertising his crap
AttacktheAndalite: the only legit site like that is that locker one where you make an account and it takes a billion clicks to afford anything
I dunno alexxm
Amazing!
Who'd thought!
BaconMane: Act as if it's for a good cause:In reality the guy just lies to get the game by playing a lie
twilight_sprinkle: Putlocker?
Don't cry BaconMane!
EggWhite: He mean't it sarcasticly :D
I remember a site called Lockerz or something
*gasp*
AttacktheAndalite: no, some other site, it wasnt a file sharing one, it was like a store where you got points for inviting people and watching their videos
It was invite only lol
twilight_sprinkle: Seems legit
Very_Silly_Filly: it is tho, it just takes forever to afford anything

There already is an otakon fic.

Yes
otakon's so special he gets his own rule
Wut?
No clue where it is though.
Hmm, okay

The tower itself can survive around 140'c
11,01Thanks!
killerpony7733: How much is it? :o
RaveBrony: F2P buddy
05its a f2p game
What!?!?
On steam??
05yes
O.O
my old video card couldn't survive 28°C, seems that my new one's fan does a good job
I like free games :D
you can buy a starter pack if you want to get it
Time to ponify my computer again, brb
Gets you some good starter level stuff
05i got the starter pack jsut casue it was 75 off on the summer sale :P
05havent played since beta thoguh
05xD
Damn it!
:D
05im already likign this band more and more
I dont usually listen to this kind of music, and i like it :D
Wrek: I bought the starter pack and one thing i loved was the extra gold and MIRV launcher
05some will recognize this >:3
Theres no way im spending $20 on that :D
$5 wouldve been nice tho...
RaveBrony: Should'a gotten it for cheap during sales
05well yeah RaveBrony: got it for 5 myself due to sale :P
i used to have this game
hm.. I've heard it before.. What song is it?
I didnt know about this game then :(
05i played their concert earlier this morning
Hopefully the game is just as good without the starter pack :(
All right, I need to take off. I hope to be back on in short time!
Cya Everlasting_Joy!
I wasn't here then. What is the band called?
RaveBrony: It good either way, Though buying some gold to get life time 50% xp booost is a very good idea
:(
Shiiiiiz
RaveBrony: You can get a extremely small gold pack for very little and still get premium
05implyign it takes time anyways to level up
05:|
^I know that wreky
Haha :D
It just looked like a battle/PvP game. O.o
Or is that how you level up?

It seems fairly simple
Gun, grenades, run, jump
thats about it
Ah, ok.
No special classes or anything?
IDK about that

Zanon: Did you draw that? :o

Oh, I see. It says, Please enter a new tag that is at most most 4 characters.
not me caumen
Ah :P
But it seems to have no problem letting me enter in Bronystate.
It also doesn't get in the way of me making BrSt
See a tree, go right through it! :D
he will be doing some artwork for my oc soon
Zanon: did you draw that? if you did, i must say the shading added makes the picture seem like you could touch it.

RaveBrony: OH GOD ITS SMOOTH I CANT TAKE IT

i dont hate idiots. if someone is born stupid i dont think its fair to hate him for it
RIP chat
/me Ponies47 has gained +50 Respect

Underpony: 20th century

Bronysith: eh, i suppose it could get old. but it hasnt for me yet
cachi01|phone: GMod in a nutshell

I think the game Rhythm Heaven is so easy, you can do it with your eyes closed
twilight_sprinkle: im just saying that i like it but i dont like how everyone and their mothers tits know about it and even non gamers know about it
Hi everypony.
kidzrul434: Mmmmhmmm

twilight_sprinkle: i dont hate skyrim. i hate the fanboys and such lol
I hate Skinram
Bronysith: i kno, i dont really care about em
Oblivions better :3
You used to hate fanboys

twilight_sprinkle: the guys who say "IT is the best game in the seires and best game ever" when they obviously havent played the greatest RPG ever which is DnD tabletop gaming
Ohh
But then you took an arrow to the knee
Rebel scum
/me grabs gun
o_o

Bronysith: yeah, but every community has people who say "this thing is best evah", it can get annpyong to me as well, i justtry to ignore them
Hey I have one of those machines
Bitches please greatest rpg is MW3
cachi01|phone: I concur
/me grabs cachi01|phone s neck
cachi01|phone: U srs? :|
/me lightly squeezes cachi01|phone s neck
Final Fantasy you say? Does it have killstreaks?
cachi01|phone: I much prefer using the AT4
My neck is a pie
I CANT DIE
/me buries cachi01|phone alive
cachi01|phone: enjoy eternity underground
So you have no asphofagus? Fuck me, no idea how to spell
Bronysith: btw how many shouts have you founf? ive found one besides the fusrodah
twilight_sprinkle: the ice breath
69
no i hate the RPG-7 i was just making a bad joke about mw3 being an rpg lol
Bronysith: did you find it underground or on a mountain?
MW is one of the worst games in existance
Explicit instructions?
Fail
twilight_sprinkle i think i have about 5
twilight_sprinkle: mountain
i found the second word for it too
Not worst but repetitive
skyrim is fun but i need to play more deus ex 1
Bronysith: ah good, i hate zombie burials :I youd think theyd burn corpses instead of giving them the chance to become zombies
I always remember that name as deu sex
alexxm: where did you find most of them? underground or outside?
I am still waiting for the amazing RPG. i want it where you can make your own backstory for your character
Skyrim is so fucking fun when you are lvl 81 with everythin daedric and improved
well good night everypony
Bronysith it's called ANY PnP RPG

Evening SirGanjalf :)

So you guys already played lollipop chainsaw?
twilight_sprinkle i think most of the zombies were people who were chosen to guard the tombs and i found the words by shouting in areas in the game wait about a ingame day and a courier will send you a letter about a dragon shout location
NO one is really willing to read a setting primer b4 playing a game
nope
Guys, did you know: I need a new computer
Cause i fucking love it
who wants me to cuddle them?
El shitbox can't run bloody Portal
El shitbox tresientossetenta
alexxm: ohhhh so thats what the courier is for
nor are most RPGs open enough for full backstory fun
/me cuddles Scoot-Scootaloo
Very_Silly_Filly I know what you mean.

Very_Silly_Filly: thans

Very_Silly_Filly Well look on the bright side. El shitbox can work as a bomb if you try to run Crysis 2
05this movie is to lower your expectaions for later
/me hugs Scoot-Scootaloo

GarrettBrony: Lets try and make it run Crysis 3
Kaworu they would all be OVER 9000!!!!

Scoot-Scootaloo: hey man. there was an alternate ending to cupckaes fic where dashie survived. it is kind of sad....

Wrek: Oh I recall the first one, Überbiscuits.

Shooeie in a way

I don't care whether people are atheist or religious, or which religion they follow, as long as they don't have a "I'm right and you're wrong" attitude, or try to tell me how to live my life
05yadda yadda

hai BronyInstrumental
hi BronyInstrumental, we're watching the second Arn movie
did he ded
Arn?
Yeah but dont they usually have like a main force leading them like the french or english? Dermathil
ShadowStep: I don't know which it is
05last grand master was english
Most likely english
05the current one i think was french
ehhh doesnt matter :) good viewin
it's called Arn  The Kingdom at Road's End, I believe
thats why they lost wrek... the frinch only won against one other people, and that was the french :)
ok i have learned something new
that's a good thing
poisoned
alright so tommorow is the day when they show pony episodes correct?
i'm calling it
shaggypenguin: yed
shaggypenguin in between movies yes.
*yes
It's at 7pm right?
alright sounds good
7pm eastern, yes
Cool. EST for the win
i just look at the timer thing
Hello people
yes, 7PM EST
it tells you when
hi Imperios
kinda
I consider making a pony OC
Hey ya Imperios
I wonder
howdy Imperios
so many douchebags
Should a pony engineer be a unicorn or an earth pony?
So, have other people seen the latest Planetside 2 trailer? (Death is No Excuse)
He went to go get his nunchukus
Uhh earth Imperios
Imperios: earth ponies. unicorns are better for artsy things
Imperios: or science
Imperios: Earth cause AJ
Pegasi are better for bad assery
a real quick shout out for sea ponies lol
I have designed him
backstory: Saladin and Arn are... .rivals, not really mortal enemies, but closer to friends
Lets not forget: Griffons can do it all, probably better.
i dont like griffons anymore
He's a muted brown tall but skinny male pony with a tophat with engines in it
oh shit son
the whole fluttershy thing
Ryunosuke: Was Arn a historical figure?
and making her cry
And probably a gear cutiemark
He is fictional I believe
But his environment was factual
Guy looks like a Jesus....
Can he use mechanical steam-punkish wings for locomotion?
Don't hate the griffons just becuase of Gilda. She is only one sentient being after all.
it was stated in the last movie
Is that jesus?...
true
hate produces more hate
looks an awful lot like jesus
Emocakes: He sure looks like him
^
thats what I thought too
Imperios: I wouldn't recommend pushing it too far with the unique little snowflake stuff. Otherwise your stuff will end up being as fun as a black and red alicorn OC.
Would a pony with mechanical wings be stupid?
GOLD
monez
ok ill give them a chance but gilda better stay out
Well damn
What do you mean by unique snowflake
Imperios: Not, it would be awesome:)
:)
jesus be takin bribes sence 1ad
*no

I think they are saying "WOOHOO WE WON!"
Hi everypony
:p
hi Groogle
hello Groogle
Fair enough. Still, if it's half the episodes this season, season 4 out faster? maybe?
WAIT he lived!? what kind of no twist ending is that!?
hi Groogle
and nobody bet he'd live :D
hi Groogle
What film is this?
05the "we cant afford another sequel" kidn ShadowStep :P

poop
LOLOLOL http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6hxx66m3U1rw70wfo1_500.png
I lost 7 bits
8,6my bet is on a movie to coincide with the 30th anniversary
what wrek isnt telling you is twilight has been translating the inter time
0,14maybe not faster, but it can give 'em more time to plan what direction to take for the future
I bet u they die of starvation
WINNERS! TIME FOR FAMILY REGROUPING!!!
wait, who bet hed liive?
no one
no one XD
8,6I'd rather see the show end before it jumps the shark
damn lost 10 bits
mishia need more death pony, death pony of freindship
lol then we keep our bits
is not going to be the last season that's for sure
cachi01: ha
Good jack approves of all the inssuing hugs
Everpony thought he would die
Well I hope not, that'd suck.,
moar hugs >3
actually, i bet on lived. just didnt say anything
were so bad
05hollywood have spoiled you all
well if it goes to half the episodes, maybe it will be twice as long episodes?
Dark_Horst: that doesnt count
i'm still rigth B)
05TWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEST
wait
WAIT

WHAT!?
uh-p
unlikely
HA
That wouldn't make sense for the network.
oh shit, he died
hes just tired

Awww what.
He was back home for fucks sake.
Thrackerzod: yeah death ponies of friendship are important!
dammit what a tease
bucket has been kicked. many bets have been won today
05well duh its the medieval
HE DED

RELIGOUSSYMBOLBLASPHMY
05medicine is basicalyl non existant

now he ded? do i get my 7 bits back?
well he sure can drag it out cant he
05but it probably got infectedin the cold
lol final fantasy XXVII
nvm
0,14might be harder to write for as well
05and in the end took his life
Wrek: medince that isnt' just brews they THINK solve problems. or soultions like blood/fluid draining
at least the kind of medicine that doesnt involve old men with beards dancing around you waving dead chickens
05for him to die in his wifes arms
0,14big difference between a 1 hour show and a 30 minute show
Well everyone won the bet :D
Except Dark_Horst
yeh but all the popular eps are the 2 parters
theres like no dialouge, and yet i feel sad
can you cure a sword to the stomach with medicine?
ooooooooooo
*SNIFFFFFF*
0,14you'd have to change around pacing, and that probably would mess with the formula we've enjoyed
FouLou: actually, he survived the battle
Mekapix2: medi gun
Thrackerzod: are you laughing...?
even made it home
Wrek: it sucks they dont have the medi gun
05Mekapix2: aye. needle and thread to seal the wound. and desinfectant to keep it clean
*sniff* im not crying....:'(
Dark_Horst: he actually didnt. He may not fell in it but got mortaly wounded.
:'(
ok but he did keep it hidden, kind of his own fault really
we are gathered here dearly beloved...
fun thing is, the romans already had invasive surgery
but it got lost with the fall of the empire
05that ivory cross adn his swords he has carried with him since he first left the monastery many years ago
Inb4 it ends faster than we hoped it would.
05they followed him into the end
damn
to bear witness to what happens when many people make a bet that
Mekapix2: they have no disinfectint. in fact, most people die in thouse times from an infection due to the medical equiment's qaulity
Hi dont understand anything. but it is so good
0,14;__;
He's gone off to join his loyal horse
Bronysith: i agree

Hello everypony.

Thank you Wrek

So many people made bets he would die
they are probably aiming for the movie anyway
/me applauds Wrek
Thank you Wrek
Mekapix2: though around thouse times people were realizing if they took alittle of a virus*or somthing it produces, like a fluid/scab, and snort/ingest a small amount of it, they can get a lighter verison of the sickness and began to work up an immunity

regular hard drives are huge spinning disks with magnetic bits...
agreed
ssds i'm not sure about
this is one of the better parts in the movie
Fou_Lou: quite possibly
AttacktheAndalite: hard drives can hold alot more space , ssd or solid state drives hold alot less , but have crazy load times
ssd? Solid state
owloysius: So?

hi mr fire :3
ALL THE GASLINES
00,10still expecting there to be 26 with the other 13 being done by studio B
Sumica: Top Draw said they were making 13 eps, that didn't mean s3 was only going to be that.
Sumica: wait...Studio B isn't doing them?
micheal bay folks
^
StinkomanFan: ALL the gaslines?

it's a good thing they arent running away from cold air like stupid 2012

NO! THIS IS THE END!
yo dawg i heard you like fire
micheal just came
EQD has been wrong before anyways
Studio B isn't doing them!
and thats the sound of michael bay having an orgasm
why would just sending the gas there leading into the explosions? what ignited the gas?

oh God WHY!?
vb§hiya Michael
Dat kick
inb4 goddammit 3
kabooom!
explosions, explosions eveywhere
Soooooo... An explosion near a car does not blow it up?
Does it really matter how many episodes there are?? Bronies will MAKE the episodes Thmeselves if theres only 13!!! :D
Barbetos: Hollywood logic
GOD DAMN IT ALL TO BUCKING TARTARUS!
If that car was empty or had bad guys in it I am sure it would of blown then.
See?
RaveBrony: its true
Heeheehee
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4032/
lol
Barbetos: seeing as it was Meghan McCarthy, the show runner of S3, who said it...I'd say it's more or less confirmed.
00,10wrek are you on 5 in 10 again?
RaveBrony: that is not the problem, the problem is that Studio B is not doing all of them.
Unless Hasbro's working on a 2nd set of episode that nobody knows about.
Star Wrek 12 the P files
Sumica: it says he's 6/10
00,10the text says what ever we tell it to say
otakon: Oh, i see
otakon: have you seen the animation for the released songs? Looks pretty good to me.
Luna is still asleep in the corner
otakon, the script loves you extra today
~yay~~
RAWRity how much does Meghan really know though? Nothings official untill it comes from the company footing the bill imo.
RAWRity: it's not all Studio B though

KID getting my ass kicked is part of my job, LET ME DO IT

Barbetos: Again, seeing as she's the one in charge of MAKING the episodes, she has a pretty good idea.
uh oh
ALL THE POWER
Well if it is true wouldn't McCarthy still write them all? I mean it would still have the same VAs anyways right?
her daughter
yh
Or still be the show runner. Not write them all. My mistake
anyway brb need some drinkage
lol warlock
season 3 is supposed to be more brony oriented right?
05a new hope
Y u no go see Shaman?
otakon: except one thing: The WRITERS are the same. It's a different animation studio.
cachi01: no idea.
gigity
RAWRity: nope still don't trust them.
05inb4 animation quality is noticably different

it's the end, THE END I SAY!
lol
05hasbro try to take the cheap route
well there are some leaked season 3 songs
05we say fuck no
otakon: you want to see if the animation's different? There have been TWO songs released with animation by the new studio. Go look it up.
and the animation is the same
better than CoD flying
otakon: just wait and judge them when they are out
at least they got off the ground :)
Ill wait and see
RAWRity: they look the same for me
cachi01: exactly.
00,10of corse the animation is the same it's all software
Does he have his own generator?
I gotta go. G'night everypony.
RAWRity: isnt the animation studio in charge of the backrgounds too? I mean BG pony placements and stuff
So it wasn't Studio B that did the animation for those? It was another studio?
what if MLP was animated by pixar
Heas getting past you because he has access to ALL ELECTRONICS!
Night, ZappyTheUnicorn
Fou_Lou: yes, but seeing as Derpy was a scripted BG character, I don't imagine she'll disappear.
