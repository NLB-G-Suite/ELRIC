hmm http://cheezburger.com/6453349888
I don't know. I think the report that security is supposedly supposed to prevent access to anyone wearing clothing advertising products that compete with the sponsors was pretty bad...
I wasn't aware of that happening at Wimbledon. I think that's kinda crazy. Someone wearing a Pepsi shirt where Coke is a primary sponsor doesn't detract from Coke getting all their normal advertising (using Coke as an example since they're a sponsor for the Olympics)

on a quadcore
I haven't overclocked, but I have a quadcore
id watch it http://cheezburger.com/6377433088
also, i have decent cooling in my rig
youll never get that in a laptop
05xD
it says i have 751 i have 2048
though ram wise, it says i have 8.2gb somehow?
but realise its a 2gb card not a 768
Yea, which is exactly why the gaming rig I'm getting has exactly that...
though i should actually replace my cooling system
i cant actually play games with my cpu clocked like that
No one streaming? :(
It says offline ;O
refresh?
Laptops are more than able to do graphic-heavy applications now. Companies like Nvidia have developed mobile graphics processors and have been using them for years now. I've had no problems playing high-end games even on this laptop, with the only limiting factor being the other hardware.
dungeons of...
grimrock..?
http://cheezburger.com/6375284992
i think its called that
b) theyre still slower than the desktops and have to run at reduced settings

*was
didn't mean to offend <3
pretending to hate him...as if we wouldn't see what's really going on
you are part of his fanbase
you spread the word whenever you can
I have one reason to hate him, And it has nothing to do with he is a person but rather the fact he hardly if not even makes good music
you wouldn't talk about ponies that much
Whom?
do you hate?
no one in particular. except you :P
hai everyone
00,02Wrek, Ping
arguing with haters is stupid
and that's a problem because ?
if you have to ask, then you wouldn't understand
http://ponypic.com/i/hrmRn.jpg

Hey everypony
I had the wierdest dream last night
retrofuture is best future
I dreamed of chess last night...
But, me being me, I'm armed
:P
haha
6:20 sun is out, Time to sleep
Goodnight/day everyone
Sleep well
I had a TF2 related dream a while back :P
I do get the most retarded dreams in the world
I get the most retarded dreams
you don't even want to know about my dreams XD
I have roughly 2 dreams a week
I have a dream every day
actually, I've read that everyone dreams several times a night, you just don't remember most dreams :3
I haven't dreamt in ages until last night
Pretty much went on the roof and sniped zombies with the one shot one kill sniper rifle
I presume I woke up because I was killed
Which actually would of been the first fatality in a while
I never dreamed of ponies. It would probably take several hours of massive pony exposure to get such dreams...
ekyps how much more :P
don't know if it's worth it
I've never dreamt of ponies either that I can remember, which is actually a bit odd
wtf is thi
I accidently shot and blew up the building near me
was walking away, and it suddenly ended
I *presume* I was hit be debris
This site is 13+

mothballs
08,01but at least it wasn't penis.

Victims*

hahahaha
he werent doin anything wrong
C++ or Java.
in my experience, slow booting isnt caused by defrag, but by some update or other software inserting itself on boot (especially adobe)
BRB
i dont like this movie. to much horse killing
05jsut FYI, that horse has been following him since he was raised at the monastery
05and served him faithfully during his time at the war
05up untill now
That makes it even sadder... :'(
I Dont remember the horse

^
05im a pagan apparently
/me is indifferent to all beliefs
I'm silly
I like sacrificing goats
anybody know the name of this movie?
Arn 2
I respect people for their beliefs as long as they respect me
really
Allo everypony, what're we watching?
Arn
even athieim
Lol
atheism is not a belief
05its the lack of a belief
something tells me he is not fit to lead
no its a religion of non religion i get it i get it
athiesm is the absence of belief
Oh chat's not talking about religion is it?
look how they have inslaved these horses this is outragous
05stop turnign this into a matter of definition, there is no point.
is it a lack of belief
05Meanwhile: part 2 of the Arn movies on stream
What's this?
Is this movie about religion?
Kinda
05no
okay then
05its about one man having to flee his country due to christianity and is forced into becomign ac rusader
05yadda yadda
Htafn i agree
ehhh could be but i already shutdown anything i don't want to startup on boot

I consider making a pony OC
He went to go get his nunchukus
I have designed him
backstory: Saladin and Arn are... .rivals, not really mortal enemies, but closer to friends
i dont like griffons anymore
oh shit son
the whole fluttershy thing
and making her cry
He is fictional I believe
But his environment was factual
Can he use mechanical steam-punkish wings for locomotion?
it was stated in the last movie
hate produces more hate
^
Would a pony with mechanical wings be stupid?
monez
Well damn

I think they are saying "WOOHOO WE WON!"
Hi everypony
:p
Fair enough. Still, if it's half the episodes this season, season 4 out faster? maybe?
i lost 5 bits! nooooo
8,6if there is a s4
I lost 7 bits
8,6my bet is on a movie to coincide with the 30th anniversary
I bet u they die of starvation
WINNERS! TIME FOR FAMILY REGROUPING!!!
no one
no one XD
8,6I'd rather see the show end before it jumps the shark
damn lost 10 bits
lol then we keep our bits
is not going to be the last season that's for sure
Good jack approves of all the inssuing hugs

05but it probably got infectedin the cold
nvm
0,14might be harder to write for as well
05for him to die in his wifes arms
0,14big difference between a 1 hour show and a 30 minute show
Well everyone won the bet :D
yeh but all the popular eps are the 2 parters
theres like no dialouge, and yet i feel sad
ooooooooooo
*SNIFFFFFF*
0,14you'd have to change around pacing, and that probably would mess with the formula we've enjoyed
even made it home
05Mekapix2: aye. needle and thread to seal the wound. and desinfectant to keep it clean
:'(
ok but he did keep it hidden, kind of his own fault really
we are gathered here dearly beloved...
fun thing is, the romans already had invasive surgery
but it got lost with the fall of the empire
05that ivory cross adn his swords he has carried with him since he first left the monastery many years ago
Inb4 it ends faster than we hoped it would.
05they followed him into the end
