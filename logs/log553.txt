i have no idea whats going on
08,01just as hairy skin is diferently sensitive to non hair skin

You know, the sad part is, it wasn't even a bad song. In fact it was kind of good.
it's not bad at all
11,01otakon: He came in, advertised, then PM advertised me. Got kicked. Advertised some more.

well...
pony... that is all
Speaking of which... this weekend, I'm going to a convention, meeting up with my friend, who's getting married on the 20th.
Already have, 50 times.
Eugh
Bad colour
WELP GUYS!
http://i.crackedcdn.com/phpimages/photoshop/6/7/9/136679_slide.jpg?v=1
I guess linking ANY site is advertising now
They have come! The Elder Gods!
Other than EQ.
even if it's this one
We'll be at a convention, but it's not appropriate to ask the ladies to assist.
8,6there is a difference between people that have contributed to the conversation linking videos for others to see in order to expand interest in subjects, and people entering the channel for the -sole purpose- of advertising
ANY outside site
And We're not into strippers.
/me was an altar boy.
My friend doesn't even drink :-/
XD
Yeah, bad colours
Hmm
So...let's talk about something else then.
Like ponies.
Derpy is best pony

08,01urgh

That's all right.
08,01so i'm sneezing all over the fuckign place

Saturn Thats why I never leave the house ^_^ Hay fever

Take some tissues.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wlov2cV1F0 ya'll probably seen it already but have some hnnng

Saturn: a sneeze is 1/7th of an orgasm
08,01FairysHuff: i'm fine when i have anti-histamines

^That has been dubbed dirty Rarity colour. :P
08,01prince-dari: you may want to unhtmlentity yhat
poor Saturn why is he dubbed dirty rarity ?
unhtmlentity
wat
Bonus colour:
:P
Choose
1+2 = BURNING EYES. 3 = Too "normal" To not stand out. 4 = It's the best....sadly.. <.<
My vote's on Dirty Rarity.
TO MUCH COLOR! D:
Dirty Rarity...
It's a TRICK!
Saturn: Oh well
he WANTS you to vote Rainbow
Last one
DON'T DO IT!
I vote 3
my plan has a flaw
THREE I SAY!
dirty rarity
Not gonna lie, I think it's hilarious that those messages read "New BS Post".
Raaaaiiiinbooooows
IDC
If they're gonna be "BS" posts they should be brown.
knew someone would make the BS post joke
Considering I already did...

But imagine rainbow text on a rainbow background.
I vote Rainbow =P
creepiness is jsut one of the fine services I provide.
i vote 3rd or 4th
Someday.
is the stream still having difficulties?
I vote rainbow on cyan
oh

11,01Lo
11,01:p
I KNEW IT!
0.9999... (repeating infinitely) is exactly equal to 1.0. You can't explain that.

HOW DO YOU
let a = 0.99999....
ARGGH
11,01hen3ry: I can.

RIGHT I'll break it down to...Elementary Math School
Oh great a math debate
IF we speak of terms for irrational numbers
http://youtu.be/xr6L7-yVp0s I found the right link!
i'm great at math debating!
11,0110*0.999 - 0.999 = 99.999.. - 0.9999... = 99 =/= 1.
Ow my eyes.
3PINK
Dirty Rarity has spoken.
ESCAPE IT YOU FOAL
SEE
*UNESCAPE
0.999...^infinity tends to 0
1^infinity = 1
Therefore not equal.
....
:D
11,01But there are a bunch of proofs for 0.9999 = 1.
ALL THIS MATH IS HURTING my braaaain

well, you'll think of something, right
hi guys
Eeeeeeh. Break.
08,01BUCK: Our venue is 20% less flamable than other conventions
/me 11,01is a complete store
and then everyone launched left4dead
hungry....food time!!
You're confusing the standard English meaning of "theory" with the scientific meaning.
Then why does everyone say that Theories creates facts when proven to be?
Except those of us that don't have it.
"Scientific theories are the most reliable, rigorous, and comprehensive form of scientific knowledge. This is significantly different from the word "theory" in common usage, which implies that something is unproven or speculative."
Amen.
I have a theory, they might be bunnies....
That's...weird..
you need supporting evidence and predictions for theory
How comes Scientific Theories outvalue Religious theories then...?
Shrug ANYWAY
wat are you guys talking about?
08,01Vordox: scientific theories get validated by evidence and peer reviewed
I'll just say this, our very foundation of standing can be flipped within one single find of evidence that our understand of how the universe work. How can it be rigourus then?
08,01ones that are provably wrogn are jun.ked
hmm
it isn't really flipped most of the time. Newtonian physics is a very good approximation of Einstein's physics.
http://derpiboo.ru/35836 Megasweet y u look similar to J. Joseco
at low velocities, anyway
don't take it too seriously guys
08,01Vordox: rigorous means thourough
and... ok, I'm gonna go get some food, since my grammar is getting atrocious.
Oh that meaning of it.
...Only when you...fail?
...
That's how it's supposed to work anyway.
Relativity is still called "The Theory of"
It happens cause it happens, why
Part of it was accepting when you're wrong
For example: If you throw an apple in the air, it'll eventually fall and return to Earth. That's a law. The explanation for this (gravity) is a theory.
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3384/
orbit!
Or rather, an equation if I recall last time I read about it.
ya''ll http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aaubVlhNK4
That I understand.
the terminology is not consistent, you just have to deal with that.
Thus, theory is not inherently unproven.
I thought a "scientific law" referred to something that could be described and predicted using equations.
Saturn: Maybe someday.
example?
I'm not native to any english language. =P Just saying
brb
08,01and my thumbs already hurt from a rather lengthy rp session tonight
Still...
Saturn O_____o
08,01panda-drawing: yes?
A lot of times, theories/laws predict statistical rather than exact outcomes.
Saturn <3 wubs?
I AM SCIENCE!!!!1
It'll happen, no doubt.
Hah
08,01panda-drawing: all the wubs
11,01RPing a planet takes a lot of thumb work.
11,01:p
It's happened before.

Welcome to reality?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AHHOTDzWuM did someone say wubs? :D
It's not a lie, mind.

pff.
There is a theory stating that all we learn we are relearning and that in fact we used to know it
ok, citation for that?
08,01whoops
08,01dropped my phone
11,01XD
Don't type while calling someone :P
Saturn: You silly :P

Saturn rooted?
FOR SCIENCE1!!
08,01panda-drawing: of course :P
and I still say, it must be bunnies.
Saturn hehe /) over clocked?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ShACteRduY
I'm too dumb to live
The ding when you type my name/ other peoples names :P
<--- is a Meta Physic realist philosopher, YES THAT KIND
08,01i and a few others in here are de facto scientists
De Facto?
De facto?
SEE
FACTS FROM THEORIES
Thank you Saturn :P
I have an M.S. in Chemistry. I think I qualify as de jure.
I just like knowledge
i should look up de facto, actually...
08,01de facto means "in practice" or "in fact"
Ohm's Law? Resistance Theory?
11,01Yeah.
De faco is french then?
11,01There are exceptions to Ohms law.
Ohm's law is an approximation at low voltages
Saturn: But fact is meant to be "The real".
How can facts comes from Theories that cannot be disapproven?
Nittany: Laws are the authority within specific circumstances.
08,01a law is a model of an observation
/me is very into this discussion, SPONGE MODE
08,01a theory is an explanation of why that model fits the observation
Let's just theorize that food
11,01There are some materials that don't obey Ohms law at all.
08,01cleared up for you?
Saturn fact is proven theory
:D
a theory is never "proven"
11,010.9999... = 1.
it's merely accepted in the absense of contrary examples.
08,01science changes
I find one real particle able to exceed the speed of light, and I disprove Einstein.
That's the part that confuses me the most, Saturn. :) But it makes sense but at the same time, it's just..bleh
therefore, 0.999... < 1
11,01Math theorems show an exact equation.
08,01for example, it was thought for ages that ovaries only have a certain amount of eggs
No, it is exactly equal.
BUT NOW IVE FOUND YOU
don't they?
08,01but this was proved false a few months ago
08,01this also happens a lot in cosmology
Saturn: Well Cosmology is just a heap of questions mostly.
08,01Vordox: ha! yes...
KERBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL
Stream!
Biology is based on Biochemistry. Biochemistry is applied Organic Chemistry, which itself is simply Chemistry of Carbon. Chemistry is a special case of Physics, and Physics is just Math.

Physics is maths when you have a point to all the numbers
00,02goddamnit
00,02what shappening
The proof you used earlier was
brb
00,02is it still doing it?
10x = 9.9...
11,01It was someone else's proof.
It's just beeping repeatedly every time you get pinged
9x = 9
wubwubwub
00,02ok
Therefore 0.9... = 1
11,01You made an assumption at step 3 dari.
But...
Yeah
FFFFFUUUUUUUUU-
Exactly
That's why that's not a proof.

1/9 = 0.111... multiply each side by 9.
00,02Ryunosuke, we've probably all seen that
/me facehooves
08,01Vordox: i have this whole rant about the Halting Problem and Effective Computability just lined up for you
do you mean all numbers
ya
11,01Another one is 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 = 0.333... + 0.333... + 0.333... = 0.9999.... = 1.
probbably
still... PHYSICS, HOW DOES IT WORK
:p
you're getting tripped up on the idea that there an "infinitieth" digit. There isn't.
11,01It does.
00,02stream working?
You're making the assumption that it does
.9999- Repeating. There -is- a method by which you can show any repeating decimal as a fraction.
no it doest
LOGIC!!!
00,02prince-dari, 1/3 ~/ 0.333
00,02~='
When you apply that method to .99999-, you get 1.
1/3 of 1 does = .333~
*Countable
11,01Long division says 1/3 = 0.333...
08,01Science_Brony: well, there are countable infinities
but... 1/3 or 3 = 1
If you assume 1/3 = 0.333... then you are automatically saying 1 = 0.999...
00,10Pi is exactly 3!
Wait...Countable infinite? HOW THE FUCK?!
00,02Sumica, D:
heh
Proof 1/3 = 0.333...
11,011/3 = 0.3333... is shown by long division.
11,01Sumica: *gasp*
Prove it :P
/me Brain explodes
it depends
Irrational Numbers are such because they cannot be expressed as the division between two whole numbers.
It has no size
Play amnesia. Get cursed by teleporting naked guys.
there are infinite different sizes of infinity
08,01Science_Brony: infinity comes in different sizes
infinity of rational numbers is same as integers but different from reals
08,01Science_Brony: you can have one infinity provably larger than another
alephs.

11,01prince-dari: You never proved that 1/3 =/= 0.3333....
There is no 5.
right, that's why i say absurd
Cowbell?
Is this Real Myst?
0.333... != 1/3 automatically if 1 != 0.999...
11,010.999... = 1 though.
11,02Biglaw: AWESOME :D
There is no proof

or he hates cats. i forget which
Bye everyone and have fun enjoying the stream or doing something else.
yes
=.(\
oh this is Myst
I still say the same thing
and annoying sometimes
Agreed, but the cat still isn't proof that mathematics is invalid.
00,10seems to be made of rust
it can
No, it can only give us the closest possible
memetic?
>_>
Proof that 1 = 2
AA-BB = BA-BB :: Factor both sides
(A-B)(A+B) = B(A-B) :: Divide out (A-B)
Thanks dari
I'll disprove it. :P
Second Half:
11,01Ugn.
11,01*Ugh
Thus, 2 = 1
00,02an infninite series of 9's is infinitely close to one
How does our lack of observation affect the state that the cat is in?
00,02Kandarihu, its a metaphore
00,02in reality there exist particals that simply do not have state untill you interact with them
Schrodinger's cat is a philosophical excercise. It shouldn't be taken as a proof of anything.
11,01I wish I could get paid for this.

Direction you have to follow in this part of Myst is based on the sound you hear when you reach each intersection.

Except for the couple I set off by accident.

11,01I can't get jobs in retail because I have non-existent social skills. I'm fucked.
00,02and then suddenly sound changes
00,02:/
8,6Nittany, with some of the people I work with, you don't particularly need social skills to work retail
It's like a belief based on things that exist but we cannot prove it.
...

hello
If you are living some things have to be real
11,01She won't answer my phone texts, but she'll condescend my grad school decision and all of the shit I went through.
Can we agree on evolution?
Nitt: Meteorology?
Well 2+2 always equals 4
11,01Yep.
it assumes -1 < r < 1
wut is dis?
I
I'm not even following anymore.
the math it BURNS ME
I don't even
you can't
:'( no one responds to me
>_>
I don't know how you figure that it's not.
wait MYST?
I HAVE TALKED BUT EVERYPONY IGNORES ME
"science" of circles?
Correct.
>geometry
11,01I have a bachelors in Physics and masters in Meteorology.
HI merc sorry I'm daydreaming
Merx_Xephos yeah but we're all busy getting our minds blown by this ongoing argument
Until then we just take it as working
11,01But having anxiety issues that are hurting me making money.

DAMN IT DANIEL INGRAM http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-poor-guy-daniel.jpg
Because my laptop has no wifi
Also, mini applejack met my roommate!
Are you sure, you seem to be all about proving math=religion
Phone
11,01Doubt I can reason with her.
But over time, due to it evolving, it became more and more about getting the most possible closest answer, which is nice and all, but...
It's over, he/she's out
11,01Everyone supports me.
Depending on of course where the formula is used.
11,01But I think coldly posting that is derogatory.

oops. assume the same as 90% by default.
11,01Actually am on meds, but trying to come off of them because of bad side effects.

Sometimes the answer is not worth dying for
a lumberjack!
/me puts on a lab coat. "Where do I begin!"
Then hit the button.
Unless you're just aiming for the fastes possible run, in which case you can do that I guess. :P
13like i've said before
13myst was my childhood
:)
/me would make a lousy teacher
13forgot myst makes you do it yourself
13because we are lazy players
Make sure you write down that clue, by the by.

Yea, the astromony thing is for a different age book.
13quantum conundrum, already got and finished
11,01She supports me doing anything but nothing.
it's a FLUTTERSHY!
In other words, total confusment. :P
looks like myst or some sequel
11,01Yeah.
13QC was about five hours
BIRDS
13victory for phase~
11,01Some of my anxiety may be me, but it's easier said than done to overcome.
11,01Bad experience on my last job hurts a lot.
11,01Also ADHD.
Ahhh, fun puzzle time.
11,01And the move.
ADHD can be something good.
11,01Painting apartments.
ADHD alot of people had ADHD cases, where they were able to put it to good use
11,01And I can't shake anxiety on the job now.
11,01And I'm easily overwhelmed by large amounts of work.
Awww, he had it right.
And then he brokeded it.
beyond all sanity
13there it is :3
But once they do, it's devestating
11,01And that was washing dishes.
13time for mechanical age~

sorry for the wall.
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-the-meaning-of-life.png
13mechanical doesn't really have any
11,01otakon: I don't know if I could do that.
11,01It /sounds/ easy.
11,01But if I try to do that, anxiety.
11,01It's fucking frustrating.
13get realmyst
seriously, you CANNOT live on a few hours of sleep a day
for a month
neat
School from 7AM to 7 PM, BrS from 9 PM to 3 AM, Sleep till 6 AM.
Games later than Riven didnt offer any merch - I think I still have that brochure
And that was included in the 3 hour each way commute
/me Hates school -_-
/me finished school
Page, Get!
13only problem with realmyst is it's hard to find the interesting bits, since there aren't nodes to tell you "i can stand here therefore something useful"
School is booooooooooring!
i know right
then suddenly went from full time to 15 hours A WEEK
and get to mess around and have a good time with a little bit of homework
Plus. I start high school this year -
-__
How I made fun in my school, Friends, Got a club for gaming starting(We even had Tournaments in the Amphietheater of the High School!)
13nah
yeah
13google didn't exist
/me Had pretty much no friends at all in middle school
same here. Middle School was... beh
hi everypony
I hate schoolmand I always have. The End -_-
*school and
hi
If I had the money at age 11, I would have bought every item in that thing
hey everypony
hi
this pony needs a challenge
11,01I might inquire about getting a teaching certificate.
ya teaching is fun
especially if u teach comm tech or tv/video
But it'll be interesting
High school is cool when you know a lot of ppl there
wat
Though if you stay at university level, weird things happen when it comes to getting jobs
easiest marking ever
11,01Not community college I think.
11,01I wish I could go into a university.
11,01Hard work, but high pay.
11,01And research!!!!
Community College is a good extra chunk of change
11,01I'm going to do that.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
11,01Tomorrow, I'm going to teach myself Java and continue some research from my master's thesis.
http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html
I'm certain when I move out from upstairs later this year, Ill find that Riven replica brochure - I know I have it somewhere!
11,01Yes, Java.
11,01It's not that hard.
I tried to learn it...for 3 fricking years!
11,01So I can put it on my resume that I know it.
(This was back in Early 2000s)
I still can't do Java today =P
11,01I can do simple sorting in Perl.
dat music
Java is easy to pick up quickly, particulalry with all it standard libs
11,01I learned Matlab over time with help.
11,01Coding comes pretty easy to me.
oh
ugh i need something productive to do
Q_Q
/me knows VB and...yeah, that's about it.
Gaaaames.
11,01I wish I could draw. I would do commissions.
11,01Make some money.
same here
They were only in limited supply
11,01No-one wants tutoring.
but not anymore
needs moar games with ponies
11,01Reikim: Why?
i wish i had something to dodododo
11,01Why?
argh I am not PLAYING TF2 WHY DO YOU NEED TO VALIDATE THE FILES FOR IT?
11,01I don't mean making a living.
11,01But it's money.
http://derpy.me/VpAOF
Yes, but tutoring 8th grade I was able to pull down 20$ an hour
I am too much of an idealist :(
for doing algebra
13the mechanical age
11,01I'm looking into tutoring.
13no no that's channelwood silly
a couple million
but it's a professional
How?
HOW IS THIS PROFFESIONAL?
argh just argh
and / or improvement over a prior score
get it right
:P
the point is..I COULD DO THAT
:D
all hand painted
but you didn't
Realmyst
Shit, I'll paint that tomorrow
00,10winde it till it's head pops off
Okay I'm LAYING DOWN SOME RULES HERE when it comes to the term "modern art".
the motion in this version is much smoother - my versions were point and click - the only animations were the elavators
but if you are good at doing SAT Tutoring you can easily charge 100$ and hour
"Are you afraid of red"
13Cypresswolf: realmyst does that :3
Sadly ,he cannot use the mouse.
I hope everypony was paying attention - you should have memorized those symbols :P
Triangle?
we are in the crazy world of postmodernism
Really?
Another thing, Myst always had the same puzzle solutions - Riven was different every time - then Myst 3: Exile followed the same formula as Myst
Like a women putting paint on her bossom and push herself against a canvas...
And selling millions?
Massurealism, for example
Riven drove me crazy
LOOK
or altermodernism
THERE
ON THE WALLS
Wombo Tri Combo
11,01Ow.
I think the technical term for the modern movement is Metamodernism
and done oh agile one
whats on the stream
which itsself is a reaction to post-post modernism
11,01I have two OCs.
it was post-postmodern for a while
write*
but its slowly morphed to metamoderism
11,01OK
Everytime I see some "easy done paint" i just get angry
>_>
11,01My draq OC may be a maid canon.
to come out
wat
00,10this network is screwy at times
and was allowed much, much more freedom
In a weird sense. :P
I just can't stand a lot of things about today's pop music scene.

Man the frog trap puzzle was the one I never really got
Also closing the doors to get to somewhere but uh
13i learned to get the frog you set the trap and lower it, and at least have to get down the ladder outside
13then it'll catch
whos computer
don't think the frog trap is actually essential
iirc there's SOME redundancy in the animal hints
13not really but helps you make the connection for the moiety book
I'd place the bait, then go to another island, come back after a few hours and there still wouldnt be a frog in it

13they published realmyst
00,02Polydunami, they were fun when they were made
Rain I know, but why did he do that? And why are the credits rolling? I missed something
13i think they evolved from broderbund, where myst was published originally
I have no idea :p
13and one of broderbund's spinoffs published riven
00,02i liked that
13yay~<3
00,02was definantly worth buying
did you win?
00,02i clicked the about realmyst button
I'll get the ipad version
00,02i won
00,02kinda

i really need to move my pron to an external drive(to free up space)
00,02i finished it
I have a terrabyte of memory on my computer
90% of my drive is allocated to anime and games.
sonovabitch i missed it
00,028 hours of gameplay
oh i see!
realmyst leads up to riven
am i right
13yes myst led directly into riven
:)
13or rather, riven, when it was released 4 years later, picks up immediately where myst leaves off
13exile is some 10 years later, revelation 10 years after that
13uru and 5 are present day, some 200 years after the first four
00,02gota stand up for a while

Saturn how come
08,01okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration
08,01but it still hurts like buggery
Oh noes Saturn! :(
00,02java is absurdly multithreaded
08,01Phase4: i think that is an adverb i'd use a lot when talking about java
00,02true
08,01er
08,01adjective, even
00,02lol
00,02?
08,01right, now i need to find someone with a colour inkjet printer

thanks
00,02very business-y site
00,02tells you crap all about their tech

Eh wuz greht!
BRB
00,02distracted
08,01i'll need to find time for it, though
O_O
08,01this reminds me of a song
00,02needs more spike
ikr
gives me a headache
08,01# dae yer tats hang lo, dae they wabble tae an' fro? / kin ye tie 'em inna knot, kin ye tie 'em in a bow? #
08,01read it out loud
08,01it's just scottishised english
I'm afraid some of that is getting lost even after saying it out loud. :D My english knowledge is declining rapidly... :(
08,01heh
08,01this is linguistically interesting
00,02what am i doing
Saturn: now I cant make out even one bit from it :D
00,02well i intend to replace it with ajax
dae yer = they are?
08,01tats = funbags
00,02suddenly it makes sense
do they wobble back and forth?
can you tie them in a knot, can you tie them in a bow?
00,02unless
08,01pronounced like "week", but with the "ch" as in "loch"
08,01as in "jobby weecha"
Saturn: never heard that word before.
bye guys
Uncylopedia
just like wikiped
hmm
/me is drawing
00,02http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Gentoo#Installation
I suddenly realize,
08,01that's a song about flinging sandwiches out the window of a high-rise flat
00,02Saturn, an excelent reason for a song
08,01it's relevant
08,01if you're streaming, i mean
00,02Saturn, not at all
08,01that's a point
08,01http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e-omkUFUk0
08,01but let me give you a brief backgroudn
08,01i'm from a place called Fife
08,01which is a county in Scotland
08,01directly north of Edinburgh
08,01people from Edinburgh hate Fife
08,01hell, even *i* hate Fife
:D
08,01even though i'm from there, i'm at heart an adopted Edinburgher
08,01it's called the Kingdom of Fife, technically
08,01and Fifers are very proud
08,01except me
08,01i hate the place
08,01basically, if you've read Discworld, it's like Scrote
08,01it's where all the counry's produce comes from
08,01they're all farmers there, basically
08,01and people on the dole
08,01oh, yes, and St Andrews...
08,01oh frankie boyle...
:D
00,02lolsound
08,01haahaha
08,01i did for a while
00,02Saturn, any good?
08,01haaahahahaha
hello every pony
08,01no.
08,01when i used it there was no dependency calculation in the package manager
00,02Saturn, o_O
00,02then again this is the same company that makes java
08,01until... *sigh*, Oracle
00,02and they were open source friendly
00,02at the very least, they were the lesser of two evils when compared to oracle
00,02which as far as i can tell is doing nothing but suing right now
08,01nice!
hmm
08,01well folks, it's time for me to have a shower.
bye Saturn
hmm ok then. thanks ^
00,02cloudflare says its all ok

00,02i'm on 81.166.125.12:20300
00,02Saturn, dont think i'm ever going to get haskell
00,02just a little too different
go lisp!
haven't seen much haskell outside of academia
/me 08,01works in academia
08,01this is why i like haskell :P
/me is a student
08,01hahaha <3
I can implement many algorithms in it..
but beyond that..
you still there
can't think how I'd implement some application in a 'pure' way
08,01shana: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Purely-Functional-Structures-Chris-Okasaki/dp/0521663504
08,01AMAZING book
08,01examples in ML *and* Haskell!
00,02yeah
00,02hmmm
00,02i just realised that being > 18
00,02i have access to money
00,02and can buy books
I don't know any graphical haskell application except xmonad
whats the ip for the server?
81.166.125.12:20300 maybe
08,01shana: there are some *excellent* graphic and animation drawing libraries for Haskell
that aint the ip
Saturn: do you use haskell for software projects?
00,0281.166.125.12:20300
00,02i think
tried it already
00,02nope
00,02203.34.186.32:27075
08,01shana: sometimes
08,01i wrote an implementation of RSA in Haskell
isn't that hard then ^_^
00,02XAX, but soo much download
Allos all!
08,01eeyup
00,02DAT SLAPS ME ON DE KNEE
08,01and, to be honest, writing RSA in haskell was beautiful to write
Anyone got any advice for Apps to get for Android? Not games.
yup it is
00,02thats a heck of a turn you have to make on this map
00,02XAX, yeah
00,02yay

If I could just get 10 people together to start such a society it would be something.
Well, I'm all for an equal society, but I'm 16.
and that makes people arrogant and self-centered
I want to change that.
Ever sat down, and think to yourself "What has lead to this?"
Societies today are all "everyone are entitled their own opinions" until two people disagrees.

I visited the first starbucks in Seattle

*Nods* I hate bullies with a passion.
why can't schools recognize the difference?
THAT'S the real problem with bullying
bullies are horrible ._.
and that is why I was taught some self defence in TKD...
same
wasn't saying you used the wrong word - i meant society has been using the wrong word
Ok all is good...Ignore me
versus "Oh, he just tried to kill that kid"
makes you.......a little..........CrAZy........
you talking those Keurig things?
and here's the best part of working where i do...
these songs man make u think
free coffee and soda all day long
free is my favourite flavour :3
yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
i made u a pie
I had a few bullies in school, but I also had close friends
but my coworker keeps a 12-pack in his overdesk shelf at any given point
if i was feeling desperate for one, i'd know exactly where to find them
I gave 0 bucks in high school... I made myself such a target and just brushed off everything
well shit
Tranq is rebooting
Something to note, bullying doesnt end once you leave school. >_>
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-my-faith-in-humanity-not-pretty.png
Actually, bullying kind of stopped at my end when I left high school
^
^
hi there
Hi Evarlasting_Joy!
I don't think people would find my much of a target, I don't ever change my facial expression, I never say anything and if someone attempts to bully me all they get is an emotionless stare, that and the only person I do talk to is about 6' 7" and not many people are willing to mess with him.
/me cracks knuckles and glares menancingling
OMG NO FUCKING WAY http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-cranky-captain-ginyu.jpg
Nowadays I'd be ALL over that
as did i
but REALLY think about it
I liked watching G1 with my cousin when I was little :P
but I doubt I'd enjoy it today
I'll be right back.
G1 is not bad at all actually
The only thing "girly" that I really liked was the Powerpuff Girls when I was a kid
Am I the only one that didn't have a tv when they were a kid and would run to a friends house just to watch baby looney tunes?
I've still yet to watch Sailor Moon, I mean I have watched atleast 700 hours of anime, yet not a single episode of Sailor Moon...I'll get round to it one day
G1 was supposed to be wuite good. atleast it had a sense of adventure in it.
