Bronysith i just trolled with the How I Met Your Mother joke, but i really wa- wait if it ends here i will still be curius how i started the techinically things.
555 episodes of One Piece. Why is it so awesome? 12 years that anime has been running.
where is this song from
No, not FF
FairsHuff|Busy: it is good
FairsHuff|Busy: but it is so fucking long
LILO AND STICH?!
FairsHuff|Busy: Man, those tankeboun of 32. A manga going on for over 25 years, why is it so awesome.
Great music mate, but I gotta go, cya.
Bronysith Doesn't matter. I've watched it 3 times already

This is wonderful.
06He needs a little time ponies, I will play some musik for you in the meantime (:
Vordox Watched the anime. Too disturbing. It has rape in it.
VioletVanilla: Are you playingthe piano!?
Phase4: /)
/me giggles
FairsHuff|Busy: Nono, the MANGA; not the anime. ._. the anime is meh
dari: that's surprisingly accurate.
06I would like to learn this song. .
I know...
00,02Bronysith, (\ suprise brohoof
06how could I type while playing though? c;
/me 00,02hugs VioletVanilla
VioletVanilla: ....Derp
Phase4: almost as good as the other surprise stuff. lolo
I'm still here. I'm just doing other stuff
8,6you could type while playing because Vi is OP
/me goes do a speed drawing of Phase and Vivi sitting in a tree
While Shizuka is furiously trying to climb it.
VioletVanilla: 4th wall breaking
08,01VioletVanilla: use your nose
00,02lol Vordox
Think I will go back and watch the Battle of CP9 story arc. That was probably the best one.
08,01hmm
FairysHuff: You missed out...
FairysHuff: Go watch movie 10
Or the one with the Green plant eating humans :P
08,01i've been having an interesting discussion about the sensitivity of unicorn horns
Vordox Why?
08,01and pegasus wings
FairysHuff: Recommend them
08,01i think the pegasus wings are the most interesting
The Green plant one is AMAZINGLY grimdark for One Piece
08,01it's often said in fanfictions that they're more sensitive, but i'd disagree
08,01i'd think that feathered skin would be diferently sensitive
i have no idea whats going on
Vordox I tend to not watch the movies as they aren't all that good. But I shall give it a go I suppse
08,01just as hairy skin is diferently sensitive to non hair skin
Green Plant, you mean movie 6?
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-discords-chaotic-work-force.jpg
08,01because feathers are more rigid than hair, moving them would feel diferent, as feeling is derived from nerve endings on the skin
08,01as far as i'm aware, feathers contain no nerve endings
/me 11,01glomps kirzstryfe
FairysHuff: Trust me...Let me get the names
/me smooths to the jazz
08,01which would mean that, if anything, the control surfaces of wings would be *less* sensitive
08,01as they'd be mostly feathers
Vordox No need. The chat moves too fast I'd miss them ^_^
08,01Vordox: this had better be clean
11,01Wings are fun.
08,01Vordox: shorten the links; i can't get to it
08,01*link

Meanwhile: You clever bastard you.

CCCP dem ponies going crazy for faust
CCCP : I think the brony community is very accepting in art, sometimes even too much, liking stuff even when not effort has been put into it, but too nice is better than too mean !
BronyState a place where Bronies ask questions and they don't get answered O_O

Well, we don't have a stream up. So is it even against the rules?
Now that was an awkward DC. Did anything happen while I was gone?
CCCCCCCP: they gonna ban ya.

You need a valid reason why he should be banned?
eyo WallDives you there?

But false advertising tags
I havent been talking much guys

Ergh, I'm 50% /50%
see you never
TheNebulaBrony See ya
sorry bout that
that is a TERRIBLE idea.
ohh kirz is fast
11,01Dammit kirzstryfe
OH goddammit
RAWRity: Commonly this is known as the "idiot plot". The entire plot revolves around the cast being singlemindedly retarded.
11,01Gotta give him the repeal e-mail.
did you kick him or just ban him?
WallDives: holy crap these grand finals are hype
YOU BANNED HIM?
11,01Ban.
8,6not with that one
Damnit Nebula... You're on a fine edge but he actually made some minor effort in this song... ._.
11,01He's banned.
just got Red Dead Redemption a couple days ago and it is awesome /)^3^(\
otakon: yuhuh
oh goddammit
11,01And I'm keeping him banned.
not like you care though
Oh, TF2 clan match - see ya
Fine kirzstryfe give him a chance then. >.>
11,01Because I doubt he'll learn.
Reikim: first, I know TV Tropes, don't quote them at me. 2nd, it's more that these people refuse to accept the fact that they cannt have some magical happy ending without some blood loss.
Nittany_Discord: so, he's done this before?
RAWRity hehe ^_^ What do you expect? It's TV, tv people are stupid. Just like screaming women running in horror films.
on the other hand that song wasen't that bad
8,6I'll log it Nittany_Discord
11,01OK.
You know, the sad part is, it wasn't even a bad song. In fact it was kind of good.
Reikim: I'm listening to it now
FairysHuff: because it's incredibly easy to make characters who aren't stupid. That's why I expect it of writers.
Wait, you gave him the ban anyway, mods?
it's not bad at all
Vordox: they did
11,01otakon: He came in, advertised, then PM advertised me. Got kicked. Advertised some more.
Nittany_Discord: Ah... crap.
Nittany_Discord: did anyone explain or just automatic kick?
11,01I'd say that he's here just to advertise and do nothing else.
Damnit, I liked his simple style. ._.
okay bye everypony!!!
RAWRity: Yes, I know you know which is why I use it for witty effect because I know that you will get it. On another note, it's entirely possible that the show could be construed as a metaphor for society.
bye CCCP take care
RAWRity I want a games publisher that won't water down their games to reach "A wider audience" but we caqn't get everything we want ^_^
otakon: :D
I'll PM him and ask him what he'll do with Bronystate, I feel that he's just trying. ><
I FUCKING KNEW IT http://derpy.me/BRnwS
11,02otakon: We know what we're doing, what he did was against our rules and we dealt with it appropriately.
oh hi SuperBrony64|BUSY
fine
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKOPYO_Kt0 <-- We should totally watch this series.
right on SB64! /)
SuperBrony64|BUSY: What if he sends a formal apology then?
FairysHuff: but again, we can have that, because it's entirely within our power to have it. Thus, people who are not able to achieve this are considered failures.
Are you, Bronystate, mind giving him a chance to become a part here, if he does apologize or show some guilt?
soooo mechas ?
11,02Vordox: He'll be reviewed and decided whether to lift his ban.
What'd I miss?
5,14New BS Post
14,5New BS Post
RAWRity: TV reflects culture. Our culture can't accept that we can't have a magical happy ending without sacrifices.
11,01If he wanted to advertise with us properly, he would have e-mailed us or PMed us asking for permission.

Who was banned and why?
15,14New BS Post
RAWRity: Perhaps it's allegorical.
Got it. I feel that this guy might go somewhere, and hey, any music talent that knows how to link notes together in a better way is a waste to lose.
unless you know he just rushed in like MOST people do
Ill come back later
and didn't read the rules like MOST people do
also, NO STREAM

Vordox: His talent isn't lost. It's just on hold until he learns how to interact with a community better.
15,1New BS Post
so what does it matter if he even LINKED a YT vid?
Who has been banned?
5,1New BS Post
Reikim: no, it's mostly that these characters are poorly written.
RedPegasus|Soviet: TheNebulaPony
8,6if he can find the email address to make an appeal on his own, formulates a coherent and sincere appeal, and doesn't attempt to ban evade before a decision is made, then he may be able to return
What'd he do?
11,01Exactly.
1,5New BS Post
11,01And he linked his work more than once.
RedPegasus|Soviet: advertised his YT channel during no stream.
11,01And forcefully linked it.
8,6otakon, the issue is he came into the channel for the sole purpose of advertising himself
Oh.
RAWRity: Well in that case it's par for the course when it comes to television in general.

RAWRity: approve
well...
nice Cadence
pony... that is all
Ugh, I hate it when someone gets banned. I know it's completely justified and all, but it always leaves a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach.
11,02We're done discussing our process for determining who gets banned and why. If you need to know more, please feel free to review our rules on the main page.
Speaking of which... this weekend, I'm going to a convention, meeting up with my friend, who's getting married on the 20th.
Already have, 50 times.
Eugh
What to do, in lieu of a bachelor party?
Bad colour

We'll be at a convention, but it's not appropriate to ask the ladies to assist.

AWESOME ONE!
Actually that is genius and should be a definite option.
Spectrum_Rush I got shipped with my R63 self
Dirty Rarity™
-_(\
Now if you could just back it with Nittany colour, it would be perfect.
so did Sumica and SuperBrony64
Yeah, clearly. Even if Rainbow Dash is worst mane 6.
dat 
Canadian_Brony: .... ok tmi
They aren't bad singers...
I'm liking it!
11,02o-o
Canadian_Brony: everypony gets shipped with their r63 selves

I would never get along with myself, though

I do not fear you
/me isn't afraid of you
I get banned I get banned for what I was doing what I think was right
I could never be shipped with my r63 version. we'd kill each other.
:(
I love all mane 6 equally.
:P
hen3ry: probably
Anyway
08,01my god, so i think i got my mother into Black Sabbath

08,01imagine this
Petrified_Discord: YES ON WITH IT
You guys get to pick the colours for the new script.
I do not fear anyone, or anything. Nothing scares me. ._.
That shows the latest BronyState post.
kk
:P
hmmmm
Rainbow dash
hey superbrony64 you here bro?
otakon: No, certainly. I have a plan for eliminating any alternate reality version of myself quickly and effectively. A R63 version of me would have the same file. Thus...
So out of these, which are the best:
how about yellow on grey?
08,01my mother jis a 5'2 little old fat indian lady
hen3ry: ah
it's easy to not get kick
just don't talk

Dirt Rarity will win 'cuz it's funny
Rainbows of course
:P
Choose
Where was Gondor when dirty Rarity?
and then rainbows
1+2 = BURNING EYES. 3 = Too "normal" To not stand out. 4 = It's the best....sadly.. <.<
Yellow on black. Also, unescape the HTML Characters!
My vote's on Dirty Rarity.
TO MUCH COLOR! D:
Dirty Rarity...
It's a TRICK!
he WANTS you to vote Rainbow
Last one
DON'T DO IT!
I vote 3
my plan has a flaw
THREE I SAY!
So many rainbows
the last one was broken
dirty rarity
Not gonna lie, I think it's hilarious that those messages read "New BS Post".
Raaaaiiiinbooooows
IDC
x kick
Rainbows that are doubled
Bronystate is best BS
If they're gonna be "BS" posts they should be brown.

hen3ry: DO HO HO
Considering I already did...
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-whoops-wrong-slide1.png
But imagine rainbow text on a rainbow background.
hen3ry: that's just creepy yo
I vote Rainbow =P
I think they should be IWS posts if you're going that route, hen3ry.
Bronysith LoLz
creepiness is jsut one of the fine services I provide.
The rainbows would be doub-twice as eye destroying as usual.
Iron Will S<squee>
i vote 3rd or 4th
Someday.
Bronysith: wait wait, was that in the actual show? I swear it was for some reason...
is the stream still having difficulties?
I vote rainbow on cyan
superretroworld: nope, just off
otakon: possibly
superretroworld: No difficulties, just not on.
oh
To be honest whatever the colours are people will complain at me.
superretroworld: you sadly missed VioletVanilla and her brother Gigabit streaming wonderful fun music

pi isn't an integer
pi is not an integer
pi is NOT a whole number that is for sure
It's not an integer.
hey some go to omegle and stream it on the air
it isn't even a fraction
Pi is an irrational number.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBYGTEj7s0w evil version of party with pinkie
Er... Dari
but it's not a whole number
You can't say PI has a number
He asked me if the number I was thinking of was an integer.
its also a trancendental number
owlicious: of course not... its a decimal :p
The number I was thinking of was not an integer.
Pi is NOT a number, it's a THEORY of a number based on an endless decimals
Honey_Sprinkles: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2637/
It's not a FINALIZED number
still
Vordox: You mad coz you lost
he got it
Vordox: Actually it's an irrational number. It's still a number.

hen3ry: what do you want to pick? Rainbow or Dirty Rarity?
Get it right
:P
Reikim: You better talk some sense into that number
:p
Vordox: Pi fits within the Reals, and is therefore a number.

The new Bronystate colours are Dirty Rarity. May Celestia help us all.
No definiate answer, but it's an answer
Spectrum_Rush, eyesh. :3c
Implying that this will end :D
Best POny is Best Pony = Pi is Number. <--- YOU SEE THE LOGIC HERE?!?!?!?!?
Argh Headache...Humans...
agreed
seems legit http://derpy.me/9q3Te
Best pony is Pinkie-diepie
Vordox: They're both true statements, technically, so the entire statement is true.
What the Buck?
Vordox: Logic merely allows one to be wrong with authority.
Dirty Rarity is a color now?
Litwick: Yep.
Technically..!?

Reikim: no, it is exact.

How can a fact by a theory when it's based on several perspectives to understand the world, IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
uhh i need to find something to do ...
Because "theory" doesn't mean what you think it means.
Vordox: No it's not. All math aside from postulates is based on proofs. There are proofs for 1+1=2 and even 1=1, and they are really old and really long. Read them if you get a chance :)

Theory does not mean unproven in that context. A vast majority of scientific understanding is based on theories. This isn't fricking School House Rock, where a theory sits on the steps in front of the White House and sings about how he becomes a law. Theories do not work that way. ._.
Spectrum_Rush: It's okay. Mare Do Well and Spiderman saved us all!
You're confusing the standard English meaning of "theory" with the scientific meaning.
Then why does everyone say that Theories creates facts when proven to be?
Except those of us that don't have it.
8,6because I need a break from stuff, and shooting zombies helps
"Scientific theories are the most reliable, rigorous, and comprehensive form of scientific knowledge. This is significantly different from the word "theory" in common usage, which implies that something is unproven or speculative."
8,6and a campaign relieves a lot more stress than a vs
Amen.
Petrified_Discord: spidaman to save the day http://derpiboo.ru/28431
I have a theory, they might be bunnies....
hen3ry: hypothesis
That's...weird..
you need supporting evidence and predictions for theory
How comes Scientific Theories outvalue Religious theories then...?
Shrug ANYWAY
Vordox: You might be thinking of postulates. Postulates are things that we believe to be true but cannot actually prove to be true.
wat are you guys talking about?
08,01Vordox: scientific theories get validated by evidence and peer reviewed
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Math
God dammit im bored.
I'll just say this, our very foundation of standing can be flipped within one single find of evidence that our understand of how the universe work. How can it be rigourus then?
08,01ones that are provably wrogn are jun.ked
hmm
It's more like "This is what we believe, therefor it is" <---
So who wants to watch Twin Peaks with me?
Vordox: Because it's incredibly easy to change a situation with only a little more information.
True CriticKitten
08,01Vordox: you contradict yourself. im not sure rigorous means what you think it means.
it isn't really flipped most of the time. Newtonian physics is a very good approximation of Einstein's physics.
Vordox: No, scientific theories are based on what we observe, not what we believe.
http://derpiboo.ru/35836 Megasweet y u look similar to J. Joseco
at low velocities, anyway
The very base of what our understanding is, like the "ground" For what we based those theories on.
these days most scientific theorys depend on whose funding the study anyway.
Isn't that what Rigorous means?
don't take it too seriously guys
08,01Vordox: rigorous means thourough
and... ok, I'm gonna go get some food, since my grammar is getting atrocious.
Oh that meaning of it.
Vordox: Yes, science is rigorous because in order for something to be accepted as true, you must first try everything within your power to disprove it. Only when you fail can you being to prove it's truth.
science is a thing were you do stuff to proof a thing...
...Only when you...fail?
Vordox: Fail to disprove it
...
Reverse science, I like that. :P
Spectrum_Rush: no, it's to find out how something works
That's how it's supposed to work anyway.
It's deduction. Let "x" be your theory. Find "not x" - if you succeed, x is false.
Technology (n): Anything that's really cool but you have no idea how it works and if it breaks you have to buy a new one.
Vordox: You're also confusing law with theory. Law is, most simply put, "what" is happening. A theory is the explanation behind it.
owlicious: exactly to proof that a thing works because of stuff :p
Law has no formal definition in science really. It's just a theory that's venerable.
oops, i thought you meant you had in mind what you wanted to prove ahead of time.
CriticKitten: That I did not know, I assume you mean things like Newton's Law etc
Relativity is still called "The Theory of"
It happens cause it happens, why
Part of it was accepting when you're wrong
For example: If you throw an apple in the air, it'll eventually fall and return to Earth. That's a law. The explanation for this (gravity) is a theory.
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3384/
CriticKitten: not if you throw it hard enough

Actually it does owlicious, It's a logic number

Canadian_Brony: IQ Discussion over 200!!!
derpy i love you... STAY OUTTA MY PC
ya''ll http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aaubVlhNK4
So scientific law forms the "what" and theory is the "how".
That I understand.
the terminology is not consistent, you just have to deal with that.
Thus, theory is not inherently unproven.
The "What" to the "why" to the "how" CriticKitten.
I thought a "scientific law" referred to something that could be described and predicted using equations.
Vordox I dont' even know my IQ

If it involved alicorns, i will hunt you down.
Science?
owlicious: Laws are more restricted than theories because the related equations and such are limited to specific circumstances.
08,01panda-drawing: yes?
Canadian_Brony: SCIENCE!
A lot of times, theories/laws predict statistical rather than exact outcomes.
I AM SCIENCE!!!!1
I'll say this, there is a chance one day our whole understanding, a single thing, can overturn our whole universal understanding of the science we have today
It'll happen, no doubt.
Hah

Don't get tripped over the term "Law" vs "Theory" in science. They can be interchanged freely
Yes Vordox indeed
It's not a lie, mind.
or fairly freely anyway

Human language is less exact than reality.
CriticKitten Reality is what has been, what will be, and what is, not our perception of the afforementioned.
DeadpoolDash: awesome
Funfact: The universe is big. Really big. Really fucking big. Trying to understand everything is like trying to do something impossible. Because it is. But keep trying anyway, because you've got nothing better to do.
CriticKitten: Theory of Relativity, Law of Gravity. Those two should be reversed, if Law is stronger than Theory.
So guys, lets talk about how fucking creepy the Ns Room theme is in Pokemon Black and White 2!

Petrified_Discord: In more common words, yes

De facto?
SEE
FACTS FROM THEORIES
Marco De Facto
hen3ry: The misconception that Wiki (a place which is obligated to cite its sources) is less reliable than other websites (which rarely if ever cite sources for their information) is just a lie your English teacher told you to keep you from using it.
where? I see a musician/computer scientist...
I have an M.S. in Chemistry. I think I qualify as de jure.
Im gonig into stream deprivation. Thank god for tumblr.
I just like knowledge
i should look up de facto, actually...
Sorry im not a physisist or anything just psychologist.... so... this stuff flies over my head ^-^
11,01Laws are stronger than theory though I question why Ohms' Law is called a law.
CriticKitten: I didn't say it was less reliable than other websites in general. Just that it's not the final word or authority, given that any idiot can edit it.
08,01de facto means "in practice" or "in fact"
Ohm's Law? Resistance Theory?
11,01Yeah.
hen3ry: Yes, but it's easily reversed. >_>
De faco is french then?
Nittany_Discord: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJiYrRcfQo
11,01There are exceptions to Ohms law.
Ohm's law is an approximation at low voltages

How can facts comes from Theories that cannot be disapproven?
hen3ry what i meant ^^;
Nittany: Laws are the authority within specific circumstances.
08,01a law is a model of an observation
/me is very into this discussion, SPONGE MODE
How much SCIENCE(!!!!1!!1) did I miss?
So outside of those circumstances, they stop being true.
08,01a theory is an explanation of why that model fits the observation
Science_Brony: About....25+ pages
Let's just theorize that food
11,01There are some materials that don't obey Ohms law at all.
08,01cleared up for you?
Vordox o_O
Science_Brony: You missed ALOT, the very FOUNDATIONS of Science has been shaken :P
And what everyone should take away from this is that 0.999... != 1
:D
a theory is never "proven"
11,010.9999... = 1.
it's merely accepted in the absense of contrary examples.
08,01Science_Brony: id say "accepted science", because fact is too rigid
08,01science changes
I find one real particle able to exceed the speed of light, and I disprove Einstein.
hen3ry: You wouldn't be the first...
Nittany_Discord no. 0.999... is infinitely close to 1, but never reaches it
therefore, 0.999... < 1
IVE BEEN ALONE FOR SO LONG
11,01Math theorems show an exact equation.

11,01I have a physics degree and almost minored in math.
x = 0.9...
brb
00,02is it still doing it?
Physics is math, Nitt. It's just what happens when you take math and bloat it significantly. :p
Phase4: Restart Firefox
10x = 9.9...
physics = science, math - science thush physics = math :)
11,01It was someone else's proof.

wubwubwub
x = 1

11,01x = 0.999... , 10x = 9.9...., 10x - 9.9... = 9.9 - 9.9 = 0 therefore x = 1? (Which I see a fault).
Ok, try this.
Please don't. I prefer if it is started at the beginning if explained
Vordox it is impossible to prove or disprove any number to be irrational
/me almost minored in physics, but ended up with Biochem and a minor in EECS

do you mean all numbers
08,01Vordox: so ask me about it when im on a sensible computer next
ya
Vordox: Pi may not be a rational number, but it is a real number, unlike the square root of -1 which is a rational number but not a real one ("real" in the mathematical sense and not the literal)
11,01Another one is 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 = 0.333... + 0.333... + 0.333... = 0.9999.... = 1.
probbably
Science_Brony: I know, but yet you still use it, while not being final to get an answer that's closest as possible when you search for other mathemathical
still... PHYSICS, HOW DOES IT WORK
:p
you're getting tripped up on the idea that there an "infinitieth" digit. There isn't.
an irrational number has no pattern and continues without pattern for infinity. HOWEVER, it is impossible to count to infinity
11,01It does.
00,02stream working?
/me gets torch
What the hell is this?
a number can be proven rational, but not irrational
You're making the assumption that it does
.9999- Repeating. There -is- a method by which you can show any repeating decimal as a fraction.
no it doest
LOGIC!!!
<3 coutnable vs uncountable infinities
00,02~='
When you apply that method to .99999-, you get 1.
1/3 of 1 does = .333~
*Countable
11,01Long division says 1/3 = 0.333...
08,01Science_Brony: well, there are countable infinities
Why does stream lag so hard?
but... 1/3 or 3 = 1
Hey can you play a scary game? I kind of want to jump a little or at least have something try and make me jump
If you assume 1/3 = 0.333... then you are automatically saying 1 = 0.999...
Phase4 1/3= o.333...
00,10Pi is exactly 3!
Science_Brony: Logic merely enables one to be wrong with authority
Wait...Countable infinite? HOW THE FUCK?!
00,02Sumica, D:
heh

11,011/3 = 0.3333... is shown by long division.
11,01Sumica: *gasp*

Sumica: :O
/me Brain explodes
it depends
Irrational Numbers are such because they cannot be expressed as the division between two whole numbers.
Infinity is a theoretical number
Science_Brony: Which?
It has no size
Play amnesia. Get cursed by teleporting naked guys.
there are infinite different sizes of infinity
Science_Brony: Depends. How large is a mathematical concept?
08,01Science_Brony: infinity comes in different sizes
Why did I laugh at that Science_Brony .. :P
infinity of rational numbers is same as integers but different from reals

EspyLacopa: I KNOW!
.9~5, which is absurd.
Ah, but the 9 repeats to infinity.
There is no 5.
right, that's why i say absurd
EspyLacopa: x = 1/0.9
Cowbell?
Is this Real Myst?
0.333... != 1/3 automatically if 1 != 0.999...
That would still have to be a number between 0.999... and exactly 1.
11,010.999... = 1 though.
11,02Biglaw: AWESOME :D
such a number cannot exist.
NOW comes the shock here....
There is no proof
Air Compression releasing?
what is this game?
SCIENCE gets us CLOSE to what we want, but it CANNOT give us the exact.
1 = 0.999... + 0.0...1
:P
11,01Look up proof. I can't type proof into IRC.
All the proofs that exist make assumptions
there is no "infinity-ith" digit
what are we watchonG?
watching*?
Are we still debating this?

Assumptions are part of how math works, though.
argument over a joke?
SERIOUSLY why are we talking about this?
Still, I know the answer to science, why we have science, and why we cannot live without it :P
and WHAT GAME IS THIS?
3otakon, I'm sorry, but we're now banning all people we kick now. Dari is just trying to make it easier on you.
Phase4: is best at lost
You break the method by showing how either an assumption is wrong, or how it was applied was wrong.
XD SlurryMoon
SlurryMoon: O_O
EspyLacopa: Yes, all maths is based on some fundamental basic assumptions
O_o
3I hope you don't get spam kicked ota
But I say those assumptions are wrong.
I really had no idea that X-Chat was going to do that.

Reikim: YES
Phase4: you seem .....FUCKING CLUELESS to what ur doin
If you truly believe so, and can -prove- that they are. . .Then spread it so that the collective knowledge of math becomes better.
That is how science works.
Sumica: Oh u
why is the streamers version of bronystate so different?
EspyLacopa: So it's like Linux?
JRP2234[Web]: its the minecart puzzle
its a bit... evil
I think we can all assume that all statements are either true or false?
not as bad as the rocket later, but still evil
Reikim: I disagree.
superretroworld, there's a bit of a delay from the streamer's computer to mips.tv to all of our computers.
00,02JRP2234[Web], not quite
00,02i have an idea

No, godel hates you.

Simple what + what becomes what. =P
Vordox: EXACTLY
With Schrödinger's cat.
Lol
Where it's both dead and alive at the same time.
Something can be true and false at the same time.
Prick: Until proven =P
that was just an excuse he used to justify killing cats.
It seems especially pronounced when Phase4 is streaming. He's in Australia.
hen3ry, Portal 2 ftw
i know a australian <3
I'm leaving the stream is getting a little "Boring" and I want to go play some games.
i know many
00,02^ Kandarihu
I think Schrodinger gave that example as an absurd conclusion of quantum mechanics and many world theory or something
00,02too many things start with ka
or he hates cats. i forget which
Bye everyone and have fun enjoying the stream or doing something else.
is the cat alive or dead
Phase what are you playing?
Phase4: have you died yet?
yes
Now what should I do, I 've destroyed maths.
yes the cat is dead and alive
Phase4: Anyway, the cat isn't really both dead and alive. From our perspective it might as well be either, because we don't know. But the cat is one or the other, and saying "the cat is dead" or "the cat is alive" will be correspondingly true or false depending on the cat's state.
Bai Honey_Sprinkles come back any time
=.(\
oh this is Myst
I still say the same thing
and annoying sometimes
Agreed, but the cat still isn't proof that mathematics is invalid.
Science is a close answer, but never the correct one.
Vordox: Oh, is that the problem? Your problem is that you think of Science as ANSWERS.
00,10seems to be made of rust
Reikim: In our world, there is either true or false.
Today's forcast: a 70% chance of science
However, science cannot give us the answers.
it can
Vordox: Those two sentences are so far from each other that I don't even
No, it can only give us the closest possible
theres like nobody in that game
I agree with Reikim on Schrodinger's cat's theory. The only redeeming factor to that theory is the memetic quality.
00,10Science gave me a heavy backpack
memetic?
Science gave me a freaking headache
Vordox: Science is not the work of providing answers to questions.
11,01Geometric series sum: s = a/(1 - r). (look up geometric series). You can cast 0.9999... as 0.9 + 0.09 + 0.009 + ... = 0.9 * (1 + 1/10 + 1/100...), or a geometric sum where a = 0.9 and r = 0.1. Put that in the sum formula I gave, that gives 0.999.... = 1.
Science interests me
Vordox: Science is the work of observing the way the universe works around us.
Science only brings up more questions.
I saw an image macro reading Schrodinger's gonna kill you like a cat in a box... or not.
00,02Reikim, the point of the cat is we dont know if its dead of alive
11,01The sum formula has been proven, so there you go.
00,02and we CANT know untill we open the box
Vordox: And as dari has stated quite accurately, it tends to raise more questions than answers.
>_>
Reikim: But we're using a mathematical terms and solutions for it, but Math is exact, while Reality is not. Well our realit
What is this box you speak of?
Phase4: Yes, but dari was using it to disprove mathematics, which it doesn't.
Proof that 1 = 2
A = B :: Multiply both sides by A
AA-BB = BA-BB :: Factor both sides
(A-B)(A+B) = B(A-B) :: Divide out (A-B)
Thanks dari
00,02its not both dead and alive, its one of the other, but because we cant observe it, its in a state where its effectively both
FUND IT FOR THE LOVE OF CELESTIA FUND IT http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-portal-to-equestria.jpg
yay always the worse accuaracy!
Gimme a minute Nittany_Discord
I'll disprove it. :P
Bronysith: >.>
Second Half:
A+B = B :: Observe that A = B
B+B = B :: Combine terms on left
2B = B :: Divine non-zero B
11,01Ugn.
11,01*Ugh
Phase4: Effectively, from our perspective, but on a universal level it is one or the other.
Thus, 2 = 1
00,02an infninite series of 9's is infinitely close to one
Welcome back. We're arguing math and science.
How does our lack of observation affect the state that the cat is in?
00,02Kandarihu, its a metaphore
00,02i spell bad
It's a fairly simple error in the 1=2 proof.
00,02in reality there exist particals that simply do not have state untill you interact with them
Schrodinger's cat is a philosophical excercise. It shouldn't be taken as a proof of anything.
and that's my cue out :p
11,01I wish I could get paid for this.
Reikim: I'll say this, Science is close possible, Math is Exact, you're trying to mix both = Causing chaos. =P
Dammit whe did otakon leave???????
Reikim: i agree
I'm surprised I had any accuracy at all given that I spent most of the game harassing witches with a shotgun.
When*
At least it isn't a crawling chaos.
Vordox: Science isn't about giving answers! Science is about observation!

Vordox: Science is the observation of Nature, while mathematics is the study of numbers. They are not equivalent.
science is about confusing the fuck outta you
Reikim: But why do everyone turn to Science for answers?
Direction you have to follow in this part of Myst is based on the sound you hear when you reach each intersection.
Vordox: technology advancements
Reikim: But we are using Math for it, for example physics.
00,02so ding meens north and splurg meens left
Except for the couple I set off by accident.
00,02west'
Vordox: Because for many questions, the best answer is achieved through observation. And mathematics just happens to coordinate well with the way the universe works.
Haaaaai
ll
lol

11,01I can't get jobs in retail because I have non-existent social skills. I'm fucked.
Vordox: Science is not about giving answers to anything. Science is about studying the universe, often through investigating a specific question.
00,02and then suddenly sound changes
00,02:/
Reikim: ... Weird
8,6Nittany, with some of the people I work with, you don't particularly need social skills to work retail
Nittany_Discord :( same here... but you gotta try ^-^
Wait, what the hay are we watching?
Phase4: i has finished new song
11,01And don't get me started on assessment surveys.
Am I watching the chat?
Science is a mess. ._.
It's like a belief based on things that exist but we cannot prove it.
...
Wait that sounds familiar
Vordox: A lot of people don't understand what science actually means. Unfortunately, this includes a lot of scientists.
is this the part where we all watch a MLP episode together and stop arguing what science is?
11,01kirzstryfe: I need them to lie on assessment surveys (or do I need less anxiety)?
Well we can prov esome science
*prove some
Nittany_Discord well.. wanna know what helps me?
if you say MLP ill slap you >.<
Vordox: Look, if I really wanted to, I could claim that nothing can be completely proven and that the universe's very existence is questionable.
Reikim: Isn't it?
Vordox: All things are based upon belief eventually. Including your beloved mathematics.
but i cbs writing it all fully :P
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG directed at me?
Reikim: ....
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-nasa-is-just-a-cover.jpg
otakon! Ur back! Help!
Reikim: Are you saying Math is not exact?
Vordox: Where is the fun in claiming nothing is real, if you believe that why not just kill yourself?
yes panda-drawing
panda-drawing: what?
otakon i need ur OC again! Stat!
hello
Vordox: Math is based upon assumptions. Granted, they are simpler than most, but they are still assumptions.
mitamaking: Hell no, living is too fun :P
panda-drawing: okay, hold on
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG no... that doesnt really help here...
Vordox: I think I see where you're trying to go but I hope I'm wrong. Because if you're trying to argue that science and religion are functionally equal because both are based on "belief", I'm honestly not sure what to say to that.
If you are living some things have to be real
Vordox: And even with math there is the inexact, and things we jsut can't investigate.
Reikim: But it's based on an abstractness, therefor math is an exact.
11,01My mom gives me an article on why my meteo degree was a waste of time. Real supportive, mom!!!!
Vordox: ...You're claiming that an abstraction is exact? Okaaaay...
http://postimage.org/image/65fecvohr/ panda-drawing
Reikim: Indeed, cause the abstraction was made to have an exactness.
Can't we prove science with math, but not religion, unless fractals were done by a higher power
if you are a fan of SOUL EATER http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-the-mustache-is-uneven.jpg
Reikim: Math is a exact science..or law we can call it
Vordox: Now you're starting to sound like every other priest I've met.
otakon arigato gozaimasu!
11,01She won't answer my phone texts, but she'll condescend my grad school decision and all of the shit I went through.
panda-drawing: np
Reikim: Math is an abstract understanding to prove things.
Can we agree on evolution?
Nittany_Discord: dudd that's not right
Vordox: Even math is inexact in places.
otakon hm... give me about 45 minutes for lining and such ^-^
Hm, to disprove it I think I need to find the derivation for the equation s = a/(1-r)
panda-drawing: no worries man
Because it's based on some assumption, but I don't know what it is
Nitt: Meteorology?
But once we incorporate terms from science into Math it causes a differentialty, therefor "destroying" the very basis of why math exists.
Well 2+2 always equals 4
11,01Yep.
it assumes -1 < r < 1
wut is dis?
This includes numbers like Pi, M, E, S etc etc
I
What
the hay is this game?
Nitt: Ah. That's a vicious field from what I've heard.
I'm not even following anymore.
Quick_Thinker: Real Myst
How does it destroy math
the math it BURNS ME
I don't even
I thought for sure you were going to say i Vordox
sup yall:)
you can't
Reikim: Math is a exact abstraction, it HAS answers, Correct and simple, Fact answers.
Nitt: I had a friend who was going into it, but bailed. Couldn't handle the course work. Props to you for completing it.
Vordox: Square root of negative one.
:'( no one responds to me
there ain't no rest for the wicked :D
Nittany_Discord: wait, study of the weather basically right?
Merc_Xephos: you haven't said anything, plus math.
Which is what Reikim ?
Merc_Xephos The game is Myst
Vordox: Pi is a mathematical concept.
>_>
I don't know how you figure that it's not.
wait MYST?
CriticKitten: Pi was based of the science of Circles, correct? =P
Vordox: Which is a logical impossibility. Therefore mathematicians throw their arms in the air and call it i.
I HAVE TALKED BUT EVERYPONY IGNORES ME
Pi can be proven if we ever get to the end of it
"science" of circles?
Correct.
>implying that circles aren't mathematical
>geometry
Vordox: What part of that is exact?
11,01I have a bachelors in Physics and masters in Meteorology.
mitamaking: Correct, Mita.
Reikim: Which one? I'm having 3 convos at once here
HI merc sorry I'm daydreaming
Merx_Xephos yeah but we're all busy getting our minds blown by this ongoing argument
Until then we just take it as working
11,01But having anxiety issues that are hurting me making money.
Vordox: Square root of negative one.
So yeah, that's kind of a dumb thing to say. Circles are geometric, thus math. Pi is a mathematical number.
Vordox: Anyway, I think we should stop here because otherwise I'm going to start delving into the philosophy of questions.
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-a-not-so-bad-time.jpg
Reikim: That's where I live :P
Ok, so the sum of 0.9*0.1^r from r to infinity = 0.9*(1-0.1^infinity/1-0.1)
Here is my deal, there may be a higher power, but religion got it wrong, he is hands off except when he created stuff, that is the only higher power I can even except as possible
11,01And mom posts this in PM in facebook: http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2012/06/14/five-graduate-degrees-that-dont-pay-off/
Vordox: What is a question? What question are we asking? What's the right question to ask? How can we be sure of an answer
Therefore the proof you used works under the assumption that a 0.1^infinity = 0
CriticKitten: Geometric is not a science that got incorporated to math?
Dammit my universe is falling apart again.
11,01It's like "Gee! Wasted your time there. You should have gone to work!"
So unless you can prove that, the proof is invalid.
:D
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-hey-what-else-are-minions-good-for1.png
11,01Instead of grad school.
Now math, like I said 2+2 always equals 4, I know that my blood is red, etc.
Guess Whois back!
lyncast: back again
Yup
whats going on
What is this game, seems dull?
11,01Thanks mom!
So, anyone want to prove that 0.1^infinity = 0?
what are we watching
Vordox: WHAT?!? Geometry is a core field of mathematics. You cannot be serious right now.
I has news from my old roommate
We are all watching a game called Myst
Geometric is based on forms that are already proven to be impossible to hamper out due to that base of the math for exacting the formulas that come from Pi causes the answer to be false.
night pon ies
This is Myst, man it seems dull
what is about

He went to a Texas meet up while I was confined on post
11,01I guess I fucked my brain up from Lithium for nothing.
hiya Shizuka
night friends~
Dari lives?
Reikim: If you're saying that, you're saying that 1 != 0.9...
....okay, now say that again but in English, Vordox.
night Derpy_Hooves
lyncast: yeah he's alive
Ohai lyncast
night Derpy_Hooves sleep well
Vordox: Isn't that only circles?
Yay
So you're with me, us against the world Reikim? :P
And so far I haven't been banned again
1 = 0.9...
CriticKitten: Math started out as an exactness, but the more we got terms into it based on non exact answers, including Pi etc etc, the answers became not exactness
Things seem to be going well
It's the way how we adapted Math.
Vordox: That's nonsense.
This game seems evil
Vordox: Geometry is a core math.
So we have established 1 != 0.9...
Vordox: It's not an "evolved" fake science.
lyncast: well it's not like you come in that often and no trouble so why bother?
DAMN IT DANIEL INGRAM http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-poor-guy-daniel.jpg
Vordox: It doesn't mean all math is wrong though
Nittany_Discord: Have you tried reasoning with your mother?
Because my laptop has no wifi
mitamaking: Never said that, only with terms that has no exact answer.
Vordox: Geometry is the mathematics of physical constructs. >_>
Vordox: Look, I love math, but life is inherently inexact. And please don't claim that math gives "answers". That particular bit depends on what question you're asking.
lyncast: wait if it has no wifi how are you here?
Also, mini applejack met my roommate!
Are you sure, you seem to be all about proving math=religion
Reikim: Aye I know.
Phone
Vordox: Distance, shape, etc.
11,01Doubt I can reason with her.
mitamaking: Never said that, math if anything, was created on the abstract idea of being exact
lyncast: ah, well your roomate I remember (poor fellow) but who is mini applejack?
RAwr!
Vordox: So it's impossible for you to suggest that geometry is some sort of "fake" math evolved from science.
Nittany_Discord: That sucks. Does anyone else in your family support you at least?
But over time, due to it evolving, it became more and more about getting the most possible closest answer, which is nice and all, but...
A guy who goes here
It's over, he/she's out
ah
11,01Everyone supports me.
Depending on of course where the formula is used.
lyncast: well you've been doing well lately yes?
Vordox: Just going to say this because I can...your world is built on the assumption that your sensory inputs are all true.
11,01But I think coldly posting that is derogatory.
I have a new paradox
00,02feels good man
Betcha diddnt know my roommate is an army medic too! But different company :(
hen3ry's omelette is either runny or burnt, and you can't tell until you get the salmonella

So, did Phase leave that myst world without bringing back a Red or Blue page?
Phase4 should come play CSS.

Got to basic around same time I did, I was so happy to hear he got the same post as me
00,02EspyLacopa, i got a blue page
Nittany_Discord: Well try not to worry about it too much, even though that's hard to do. If you have the support of everyone else, then you schould ontinue doing what YOU want to do
Reikim: But you see where my point is?
I think philosophy is a joke field actually, so yeah, this argument...
00,02XAX, NUUUU, MORE MYST
Reikim: Wether it's right or wrong.
Vordox: Okay. Just dumping that because it's my standard method of screwing around with people's brains, and I wanted to check and see if it worked on everyone.
Phase4: okayface.jpeg
Vordox: Unfortunately no because I haven't been here until recently.
Philosophy helped define who we are today
Computer derp back -_-

lyncast: you might want to get out of here for now eh?
Vordox: Dump it in PM with a bit more organization and I'll give it a look-over.
Ohai crazy blue guy.
Wait.. how to formulate this. ><
Pyst is best Myst.
Vordox: Pi is a real number because it represents the exact number of times that a circle's diameter can be wrapped around its circumference. Just because the number continues on forever doesn't mean it's "fake" or "inexact". It means technology is incapable of measuring infinite digits. >_>
O_O Myst - Dont know who's streaming atm, but you're now BEST MOD ^_^
11,02lyncast O.O
but how do we know it's infinite?
CriticKitten: Then isn't it time to make a new math science for it?
But wy otakon?
Cypresswolf: it's Phase4
Hai an
lyncast: saxy is on to you
SB64
Vordox: I'm becoming increasingly convinced that you're spouting gibberish.
Oh noes
/me hugs lyncast
Vordox: Math is math. Science is science. They happen to have overlap. All done.
Vordox: That sentence makes no sense.
Reikim: Indeed.
<3
o.O
/me dusts hands and puts away the convo
11,01I know, but it's not easy when you feel like everyone in your family expects you to work when you're not confident that you can and struggling with work anxiety.
well that's ominous
That's...pretty damn close to what I meant...more or less Reikim
Now to argue about something more amusing.
bye!

whaaaaat
lyncast: good to see you again take care eh?
otakon: he's gone
CriticKitten: I'm not easily understood, sorry.
owlicious: she, that was a girl
Went to Walmart while I was out - havent checked for ponies there in a few weeks - got some individual ponies I didnt have
So uh, how about that cat?
Reikim: what cat?
00,02wonder what these gears do
Reikim: The Dead/Alive one?
Nittany_Discord: Have you tried meditation of some kind to ease the anxiety?
oops. assume the same as 90% by default.
owlicious: well it's a long story
Vordox: Mebbe. But if we discuss it we try to keep math out of the issue.
The cat is dead. While we were arguing about it, it starved to death
00,02SuperBrony64, lyncast == Lyra?
11,01Actually am on meds, but trying to come off of them because of bad side effects.
hen3ry: How can you say that
11,02Phase4: Yup
11,01Plus, I can't afford them.
hen3ry: If we cannot prove that the cat is alive or dead, we cannot prove if it had food or not. =P
don't know wat game this is :S
Vordox: WHAT. Genius.
wow.
owlicious: but basically troll that was not mean spirited and messed around here, got banned and went to the join the militayr. even gave us a big send off vid before she went. she pops in from time to time. Very odd girl, but nice overall.
Go apply for your nobel prize now.
Plumsweet, Cherry Pie, & 4 glitter wings - Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie, Ploomette, & Daisy Dreams
:D
Nittany_Discord: *giant hugs*
Reikim: Well we cannot open the box. *shrug*'
otakon: oh.
Vordox: 'sfine, I just had no clue what you're talking about or how to explain the concepts to you, because I haven't figured out what your misconceptions are yet.
celestia is in charge of day. luna is in charge of night, cadance is in charge of TWILIGHT
CriticKitten: Aye, I have most of the terms in Swedish...
And some of the more harder ones...Well I don't know the English Terms for them. ><
Vordox: Clearly we must open this box. (this is the part where Science happens)
No, Cadence used to be in charge of Twilight, but Twily doesn't need a foalsitter anymore.
Reikim: More like trying to get a glimpse but we cannot see still. :P
/me 11,01hugs AttackAndalite
Nittany_Discord: Hugs alll over!
Y U NO WORK BUTTON
I only get a few ponies at a time so I dont have trouble finding new ones, but Im about to run out of current toys at the pace Im going
Vordox: Aye, but this underlines the difference between Science and Philosophy. Philosophy wonders whether or not the cat is alive. Science opens the damn box (with proper precautions of course).
XD
advice from shizuka?
Hahaha
That's a very easy understandble point you made there
yay for advice from Shizuka!
if that ain't cheating I don't know what cheatcodes are
I'm a person who would open it. :P personally
Precautions or not.
Philosophy is hilarious sometimes.
Vordox: Congrats, you're a scientist.
Vordox: poisonous gas inside the box
CrimsonPhoenix: Shizuka is hax, pure and unadulterated.
owlicious: So? I get an answer before I die. :P
i need new game to play
get a gas mask. That's what may or may not have killed it.
Wait... I'm a scientist.O.o
any recomendations
lol
otakon, she played the game before
many times
ChronoClutch: Free to Play?
You know you can just buy kitties that are definitely alive
Vordox is now a scientist.
/me 13has myst memorized...
Vordox doesnt matter
Shizuka: u dont say?
ChronoClutch: Iji
I don't want to be a scientist anymore. I want to be...
Sometimes the answer is not worth dying for
a lumberjack!
/me puts on a lab coat. "Where do I begin!"
ChronoClutch: SCP Containment Breach.
im sorry but what is this game about?
I first played Myst at 11, took me over a year to figure it out for myself - Rocket was the toughest puzzle for me :)
I'll go fuck up science, brb
it depends. If trixies was inside the box...
Shizu: And that's the one thing I dislike about puzzle games. The replay factor is....not there. >_>
13riven does better
CrimsonPhoenix: Play more Tetris
Vordox: But anyway, yeah, I excel at roughly two things: putting complicated terms into plain speech, and putting simple ideas into overly eloquent phrases.
Phase: Close the door first.
13at least until you memorize the number system
Then hit the button.
WILL DO
Reikim: Teacher?
I LOVE TETRIS
otakon one last thing... blank flank?
Unless you're just aiming for the fastes possible run, in which case you can do that I guess. :P
Shizuka: you like puzzle games dont' you?
00,02EspyLacopa, i can close the door?
13like i've said before
Vordox: I am the lousiest teacher ever seen. Especially in math.
panda-drawing: it's a Pick Axe actually, he's a miner
13myst was my childhood
Reikim: Yet you have those two traits, odd.
13ohhhh yes door must close first
Shizuka is fangasming atm. :P
ChronoClutch: Check up the Iji trailer
13forgot that part, too used to games that automatically close the door when you use an elevator
Shizuka: I never liked them too much, unless it was something like MOnkey Island that was funny and had good writing
otakon hm... guess the armstrong was a perfect fit then ^-^
panda-drawing: yeah :_
ChronoClutch Well killing floor is half price if you're into survivial shooters
:)
im looking :P
Shizuka: Oh you mean "Quick time events"? :P
Vordox: But I prefer the latter, therefore I fail. And on top of that, I have zero patience.
Reikim: ...You should become a teacher
13no no like say source engine, you push an elevator button and the door closes for you
/me would make a lousy teacher
13forgot myst makes you do it yourself
13because we are lazy players
Shizuka: Agreed.. DO YOUR SHIT,:P
only game in Myst series I havent played is 5 - got most of the way through URU before my computer crash in December
Vordox: Besides, the job market for teachers is absolutely atrocious right now.
Make sure you write down that clue, by the by.
Reikim: I know...
00,022:40 2,2,1
135 is.. eh
13yay phase~
00,02and cause the doors open themselves i assume they close themselves
/me 11,01closes
Reikim: Still...Why cannot I be a philosopher ANd a scientist...Would that cause an impossibility?
meh
I am more on the lines looking for a mmo game :P
ChronoClutch: MLP Online
doesnt have to be competitive
11,01AttackAndalite: Don't think bad of my mom, please.
mlp online?!
132:40 2,2,1
Vordox: Nah, not really. They don't tend to get along, but that's not saying it's impossible. And both fields have special areas for impossibilities, anyway.
lolwut mlp online?
13what is 2:40 :3
TIME MACHINE!
11,01A time.
11,01It's Shizuka time!
OMG A CLOCK
Shizuka: The exact time at which I was born.
Reikim: Beyondtrue. ._. I've seen some convos.
/me 11,01dances with Shizuka.
When this thing hits 88 mph...
OH NO JC, A BOMB!
back to the future nostalgia moment?
Im grateful to have the experience of Myst before I ever knew what the internet was - couldnt look much of anything up in its early days
Reikim: You want to know something weird about me? :P
Vordox: I wouldn't mind, per se.
Nittany_Discord: I won't, even though she should support your decision. I'm incapable of thinking wrong or hating anyone, period. It's just not in me.
Cypresswolf: Ever play return to zork?
Reikim: My very name is based on confusement
Paradoxial Vortex.
Love that music ^_^
Cypresswolf: so, banging your head against the wall to figure out shit for 5 months eh?
ParaDOXial VORtex <--
13i know totally spoiling..
Shizuka: gonna get Quantum ..whatits?
Hey, everypony, what are we watching?
The Internet. The repository of all human information. Especially Disinformation.
11,01She supports me going to voc rehab.
Yea, the astromony thing is for a different age book.
Red_Pegasus|Soviet: Real Myst
How everything can be everything but at the same time being a paradox in itself.
we're watching Half life episode 3
13quantum conundrum, already got and finished
otakon: Yep, that's how everypony played games back then :)
Shizuka: wow that quick?
13phase that was a tree
Is that a scary game?
11,01She supports me doing anything but nothing.
it's a FLUTTERSHY!
In other words, total confusment. :P
i now hate otakon
looks like myst or some sequel
Shizu, you go through these games way too fast o_O
Nittany_Discord: well that's good right?
Well, something interesting I found: If CollegeHumer's FB page gets 1,000,000 likes, one of their guys will wear a beard of bees.
11,01Yeah.
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: but I love Fluttershy!
13QC was about five hours
then say its a tree >.>
BIRDS
13victory for phase~
11,01Some of my anxiety may be me, but it's easier said than done to overcome.
Reikim: As you see.... That name has alot of meaning to me. :P
11,01Bad experience on my last job hurts a lot.
11,01Also ADHD.
Ahhh, fun puzzle time.
11,01And the move.
cant wait for mlp fighting is magic to come out
Nittany_Discord: dude, all you can do is just pull yourself up by the bootstrapsn and keep going man.
Nittany_Discord: We have faith in you.
what was your last job Nittany?
ADHD can be something good.
11,01Painting apartments.
I am a pro at fighting game like SS4 MVC3 MK
ADHD alot of people had ADHD cases, where they were able to put it to good use
Nittany_Discord: you can do it :)
so I will be a natural at mlp fim :)
11,01And when they started making me work overtime and weekends, I had a panic attack due to hating the thought of doing that.
Vordox: And if I remember correctly, ADHD is often accompanied by increased capacities in other areas.
Reikim: If handled, yes
11,01And I can't shake anxiety on the job now.
11,01And I'm easily overwhelmed by large amounts of work.
Nittany_Discord: wait why? it's work, you need to work man
Nittany_Discord: ah
Awww, he had it right.
And then he brokeded it.
Otakon, because overtime and weekend work is draining
Nittany_Discord: dude, the only thing you can do is what you can that's all there is to it.
beyond all sanity
otakon: How old are you?
What, we're asking about ages now?
Unnr: I've been there, a MONTH of getting about 2 hours of sleep a night and working damn near 18 hours a day with a 3 hour commute back and forth.
Vordox: 27 going on 28 this month.
otakon: Happy Birthday!
Ah, that schedule, how I know ye well.
Reikim: Understanding the drain of the psyche in a work you love causing it to become less and less of interest over due time is something most people do not experience...
13there it is :3
11,01The next interview, I became overwhelmed because the guy was pointing out all of these things I might have to do. Blew the interview. I didn't even get the job, and I was getting anxiety.
But once they do, it's devestating
otakon: what frustrated me most about this game - wont give too much away - involved mazing along a track
ohai shizu!
11,01And that was washing dishes.
13time for mechanical age~
Nittany_Discord: Any news from your brother about his opportunity?
Vordox: Ah, I see. I'm glad that I've managed to avoid that thus far.
Reikim: Dang meant this to Otakon =P
11,01Vordox: Not really. He's being worked hard and hasn't had a chance to talk to his manager.
Tv book?
I was working at Dunkin' Donuts morning shift, had to leave my house 4 am every day and then I had to go to work as a Deli slicer but didn't have enough time to go home and catch nap or shower or nothing bc no car. Then i worked to 11 pm at night average and sometimes I didn't get home until the next morning bc the buses and trains stopped running and it was too far to walk and I had no ride.
11,01He was working all weekend.
sorry for the wall.
Nittany what does he do?
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-the-meaning-of-life.png
13this will be good
So, did Phase read and take notes from those books in the main island library?
13mechanical doesn't really have any
11,01otakon: I don't know if I could do that.
13dat useless throne~
Shizuka: which version of myst should i get?
11,01It /sounds/ easy.
11,01But if I try to do that, anxiety.
otakon: I would kill myself before succumbing to a schedule like that.
11,01It's fucking frustrating.
13get realmyst
otakon: Was working...?
Nittany_Discord: I did it for a month, but it was goddamn tiring me out. Couldn't do it anymore, had to take one job over the other.
Vordox: this was several years ago
ty Shizu
otakon: Ah
seriously, you CANNOT live on a few hours of sleep a day
for a month
I wish I had the soundtrack to this game - Riven if I remember right, came with a little brochure with actually replica merchandise from costumes to weapons seen in game
neat
otakon: I sleep like...what..3 hours a night? =P
Vordox: yeah, but not from NOT being home to do it
School from 7AM to 7 PM, BrS from 9 PM to 3 AM, Sleep till 6 AM.
Vordox: I had to walk 3 miles a day any weather to get to these jobs.
Games later than Riven didnt offer any merch - I think I still have that brochure
otakon: And how did you feel abotu the jobs?
And that was included in the 3 hour each way commute
/me Hates school -_-
Ponies47: School is EASY :P
/me finished school
Ponies47: Aw, don't be like that!
Page, Get!
13only problem with realmyst is it's hard to find the interesting bits, since there aren't nodes to tell you "i can stand here therefore something useful"
Vordox: they were jobs, they were paying the bills. One cut my hours too much though, so I had to switch jobs.
School is booooooooooring!
i know right
I started as a Deli Slicer and it was going well, plenty of hours.
Ponies47: Make it fun then
Ponies47: Then you're not doing it right.
Ponies47: But it will be usefull when you grow up >.<
then suddenly went from full time to 15 hours A WEEK
honestly school is the best time of a persons life you get to be in an environement filled wiht friends
and get to mess around and have a good time with a little bit of homework
Plus. I start high school this year -
-__
Shizuka must had googled a bunch of stuff when she played Myst
so I HAD to find another job or a second one to afford my bills
yeah but school gets alot of trouble and dramma
13nah
yeah
:| They're not in the box anymore
13google didn't exist
/me Had pretty much no friends at all in middle school
Ponies47: I mean when your like 20.
Vordox like a boss
otakon: Ah...work cut
Ponies47: You will either love or hate high school. The trick is realizing that the difference between the two is largely based on your own choices.
Shizuka: o_o sounds scary
same here. Middle School was... beh
ChronoClutch: We turned the boring sitting in the library when free and having a chat, to just BLOW it out and do some fun instead.
Dat kerbal desktop
hi everypony
I hate schoolmand I always have. The End -_-
hi Crazyhippie
*school and
hi
Hey CrazyHippie
YOU CONTROL YOUR LIFE; DO IT TO WHAT YOU WANT
If I had the money at age 11, I would have bought every item in that thing
Ponies47: Then you will continue to do it wrong and you will continue to be miserable and that's terrible.
Reikim: That's school...
what are we watching?
Lollipop Chainsaw is strangely amusing to watch, and not just because it sounds like Twilight Sparkle snapped one day and started taking a chainsaw to everyone.
hey everypony
Vordox my school did the same thing except they would only play halo 3 and ssbb, I love both games but I was way out of tjeir league skill wise so I stopped going
Reikim: The quicker people learn that they can DO alot of fun, in their words, it becomes way better.
hi
Vordox: yeah, sucked man. I did it for a month, I eventually told the my boss at the deli "I WILL be off on SUNDAY, I cannot make it to work and I need sleep" and after that I gave him my two weeks and switched to Dunkin' DOnuts full time. I liked DD, it was interesting and was there 3 years.
this pony needs a challenge
ChronoClutch: Awww.
What are we watching?
Vordox: Life is my bitch. If it starts getting uppity I smack it around a bit until it settles down.
Reikim: I hated middle school and pretty much had no friends at all -_-
Press random red buttons, it'll help
11,01I've love to stay in academia to teach.
Reikim: XD
Reikim oh god thats wat she said
Nittany_Discord: You have a teaching permit?
11,01I might inquire about getting a teaching certificate.
ya teaching is fun
Ponies47: That's not high school. Go. Search. Make friends.
Nittany_Discord: It MAY be low paid work...
especially if u teach comm tech or tv/video
But it'll be interesting
High school is cool when you know a lot of ppl there
wat
Though if you stay at university level, weird things happen when it comes to getting jobs
easiest marking ever
11,01Not community college I think.
Nittany_Discord: Oh specialized teaching?
11,01I wish I could go into a university.
13now i have confused phase :3
11,01Hard work, but high pay.
teh bombs
11,01And research!!!!
Community College is a good extra chunk of change
Ponies47: Besides, I've gone through most of my life with only a circle of maybe five good friends, less than that at times. You don't need much more.
Nittany_Discord: Yeah Research during free time :P
11,01That's what I want to do.
11,01I'm going to do that.
Nittany_Twilight is that you???
Nittany_Discord: If you want to do it, DO IT.
im back from my horrible week from home to go to my ants wedding
Nittany_Discord: Sure it'll be hell at first... >.>
Reikim: School doesn't start until the end of August. Plus I hate the fact since I'm a freshman I have to go in 1 day earlier before everybody else does -_-
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
11,01Tomorrow, I'm going to teach myself Java and continue some research from my master's thesis.
11,01It's stuff that'll be published.
Phase loves pressing that button
Nittany_Discord: ..wait...Java ._.
V
http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html
I'm certain when I move out from upstairs later this year, Ill find that Riven replica brochure - I know I have it somewhere!
Ponies47: Repeat: Go. Search. Find the friends that are there but haven't been discovered yet.
11,01Yes, Java.
DEAR GOD, WHY JAVA
11,01It's not that hard.
Ponies47: Find whatever you love doing and do it. You'll meet people.
I tried to learn it...for 3 fricking years!
11,01So I can put it on my resume that I know it.
(This was back in Early 2000s)
11,01I taught myself Perl in a few weeks or so.
I still can't do Java today =P
Vordox: See, this was your problem.
once you get to know java, the other stuff you learn is easy to do
11,01I can do simple sorting in Perl.
dat music
Java is easy to pick up quickly, particulalry with all it standard libs
11,01I learned Matlab over time with help.
I can do partial C++, Flash AS3, GML, URCS.
Ponies47: Also, try some of the arts. In my experience, bronies tend to congregate in the arts.
11,01Coding comes pretty easy to me.
Reikim: I suck at art but yet I signed up for it. I'm not doing anything like sports. -_-
why is that game keep poping you out like that?
xxMoopyxx: Chatting :P
Ponies47: Art is good. Try one. Music, visual, drama even.
oh
Ponies47: You might want to try to form an intermural team if your HS offers it.
Ponies47: Visual art tends to attract the most bronies, on average.
ugh i need something productive to do
Your team can suck, but you can play to have a good time
Q_Q
/me knows VB and...yeah, that's about it.
and you will meet a bunch of other people
My art = FRIENDSHIP AND LOVE AND TOLERANCE AND games...yes games.
ah games
Gaaaames.
11,01I wish I could draw. I would do commissions.
11,01Make some money.
same here
They were only in limited supply
Reikim: No I signed up for art art. We're you paint (squee) like that. -_-
11,01No-one wants tutoring.
I used to able to scribble a bit
Nittany_Discord: Ahahahaha you're not serious are you.
but not anymore
Ponies47: So visual art. Good.
needs moar games with ponies
11,01Reikim: Why?
i wish i had something to dodododo
Nittany_Discord: Doing commissions for money. Pffft.
11,01Why?
Reikim: Heard of Freelancers who makes millions?
11,01It's better than my current options.
Nittany_Discord: Art and making money don't generally find themselves in the same sentence.
Nittany_Discord: The money in tutoring is SAT and highschool/ private grade/middleschool turoring
argh I am not PLAYING TF2 WHY DO YOU NEED TO VALIDATE THE FILES FOR IT?
Nittany_Discord: Slave over a canvas for eighteen hours to make maybe forty bucks.
11,01I don't mean making a living.
Reikim: Yeah. But I suck at art. Plus it's only fresh man year. I'm not telling anybody I'm a brony until I'm settled down, have friends, ect -_-
just stuff on the sie
11,01But it's money.
http://derpy.me/VpAOF
Yes, but tutoring 8th grade I was able to pull down 20$ an hour
Vordox: About as easy to find as my soul.
I am too much of an idealist :(
for doing algebra
13the mechanical age
you'd be surprised what people would pay for for a half descent drawing.
13full of red herrings
11,01I'm looking into tutoring.
Unnr: ...My god that's good.
Reikim: http://www.artnet.de/Images/magazine/features/ortland/ortland09-26-06-2.jpg <--- Guess how much this is worth?
Shizuka: cut the tree with the herring
13no no that's channelwood silly
a couple million
but it's a professional
Correct owlicious
How?
HOW IS THIS PROFFESIONAL?
Vordox: I've taken formal art training, I'm aware of the successes. I'm also aware of the success/failure ratio on "pure" artists.
THE HELL
a professional did it. Style and appearance? I don't get modern art.
Reikim: Indeed... I know
it's just a RED CANAS
otakon: it's partly blue
SAT tutoring can double, but you have to be good and advertise a minimum score
argh just argh
otakon: no... it's a blue bit, a red bit, and a tiny gold bit on the end
its not just A red canvas
and / or improvement over a prior score
it is THE Red Canvas
Tassadork: THAT is not the point
get it right
otakon: oh look, a bit of yellow!
:P
the point is..I COULD DO THAT
11,01I applied to a job teaching MCAT training classes, but I didn't pass the entrance exam.
:D
all hand painted
otakon: I'd explain that except that would mean dredging up several records on non-objective art and I wouldn't believe half of it anyway.
but you didn't
11,01And it was a physics test.
hello everypony, what game is this?
Realmyst
Shit, I'll paint that tomorrow
00,10winde it till it's head pops off
DashieMusic2: myst
hiya DashieMusic2 this is Real Myst
Reikim: Should we draw in the Art Paradox into this discussion? :P
Okay I'm LAYING DOWN SOME RULES HERE when it comes to the term "modern art".
The flat red canvases and such? That was modern art...twenty years ago or so.
the motion in this version is much smoother - my versions were point and click - the only animations were the elavators
but if you are good at doing SAT Tutoring you can easily charge 100$ and hour
It has its own name now, which I can't remember for the life of me.
"Are you afraid of red"
from what I remember a friend in the states was able to do
and the gear road for the clock on Myst island
Modern art nowadays is a lot flashier and is heavily influenced by culture. Global warming is an incredibly current theme.
13Cypresswolf: realmyst does that :3
Vordox: Red?
Red_Pegasus|Soviet: yES
13hmmm when will phase pull out the notebook :3
:) Oh how many times did I run around in cirlces in this game....
Reikim: I still look 30+ to Infinite years before Modern art, and I am proud, I turn my head to today and just sigh
Vordox: Have you actually seen any of today's art? Not an accusation, just asking.
Sadly ,he cannot use the mouse.
Reikim: I dropped Modern art out of my area of interest way over 15 years ago
I hope everypony was paying attention - you should have memorized those symbols :P
Triangle?
But Modern art refers to the period between 1850 and 1970
we are in the crazy world of postmodernism
otakon uh... you have skype right?
Vordox: Modern art has actually expanded. What the term is used to refer to is its own era, and I'll be damned if I can remember it now but it only lasted through the nineties. The current art world is a lot more varied.
panda-drawing: yeah i do, it's otakon1984
Really?
panda-drawing: why?
Another thing, Myst always had the same puzzle solutions - Riven was different every time - then Myst 3: Exile followed the same formula as Myst
If i put water in a cardboard box, is that art?
Like a women putting paint on her bossom and push herself against a canvas...
And selling millions?
Vordox: Yeah. A lot of it is hippies complaining about the environment.
11,01I forget who asked permission to draw my OC yesterday. I'd like to see what he's drawing.
otakon im on mobile, you have to add me ^-^ so i can send you the drawing silly ^-^
Vordox: Not that, that was a weird one.
panda-drawing: ah
Reikim: That sold...
Massurealism, for example
Riven drove me crazy
Nittany_Discord: Wasn't me. =/
otakon its "theagilepanda"
LOOK
or altermodernism
ART
THERE
Vordox: There are actually serious painters still! And sculptors. Lot of sculptors who work in prefabs. And performance art.
ON THE WALLS
/me 11,01draws panda-drawing
Damnit, who wrote the last ping, I got kicked. :P
:( I am dieing here from boredom wat to doooo Q_Q
GOD DAMN YOU WREK
Vordox: That would be me.
Wombo Tri Combo
11,01Ow.
Nittany_Discord drawception xD
I think the technical term for the modern movement is Metamodernism
and done oh agile one
whats on the stream
Dat aint Vordox
Nittany_Discord: You have an OC? May we see?
^-^ thank you otakon
which itsself is a reaction to post-post modernism
pony_7007: it's Real Myst
panda-drawing: np
Okay, who pinged me last before I got kicked, I couldn't read, Was it you Reikim ? Or Unnr ?
Unnr: I thought it was postmodernism still.
otakon: thanks
11,01I have two OCs.
Vordox: Me.
nope
Reikim: What did you wrote?
it was post-postmodern for a while
write*
Nittany_Discord: Is one a maid?
Nittany_Discord may i have the links again? ^-^
Vordox: Something about serious painters still existing. And prefab scultors.
but its slowly morphed to metamoderism
I loved reading the books in this series - the ones in game - though the Myst Reader is my favorite series next to Redwall
Reikim: The thing is, I see art where effort was put into the canvas.
REAL TO GOD DAMN EFFORT
Nittany_Discord pm though :/ pwease???
Vordox: What's the canvas, though?
11,01OK
Vordox: :)
Everytime I see some "easy done paint" i just get angry
oh god the disscussion on art is still going
Reikim: That canbe anything
me = cliff jump
Anywhere where the art(Drawing Art now) can be done is the canvas.
Reikim, in regards to your previous comment about "slaving away" on a canvas for 18 hours to make $40: professional artists can usually draw commissions in a relatively small amount of time and make a decent amount of money. The industry standard is actually quite high. Obviously an artist has to be quite skilled and well known but the point still stands that one can be quite successful while doing commissions.
ChronoClutch: Its just a postmodernist reaction to the earlier science and maths discussion
>_>
Vordox: Right then. Anyway, that was modernism, now (as Unnr has explained) we have gone through two more movements and ended at metamodernism. Which is a lot of complaining about society.
1st season of MLP in 1080p done now for season 2
Vordox: Correction: Art has almost always been complaining about society. Sorry about that.
11,01My draq OC may be a maid canon.
Reikim: Hehe
I have already watched all the mlp episodes like 3 times I need more Q_Q
Reikim: http://www.twcenter.net/forums/showthread.php?t=145621 <-- Might be something of interest to you
00,10did I just see Vordox get kicked 3 times in a row?
ChronoClutch: Go Tyoutubing
Yes Sumica...
You too Unnr, that link
i mean like more new episodes
to come out
Are their people in this game?
wat
The thing is that with the advent of photography, art was free to break free from the constraints of the real
00,10this network is screwy at times
and was allowed much, much more freedom
That being said, there is some art that is just lazy.
:P Reikim
Unnr: As I said, when I see effort, I like it, when I see no effort I hate it
I can FEEL art.
In a weird sense. :P
Vordox: So I guess you're like me and hate the majority of pop music then.
Reikim: ...urgh...
Reikim: 4 Chord songs has a hit or miss, depending on how it's done
Thank God, finally someone who relates.
Reikim: Good enough answer?
What you mean Thank god? ASK EVERYONE here.
This game angers me greatly
I just can't stand a lot of things about today's pop music scene.
what we watchin'?
Starting with lyrics, working up into the gradual assimilation of dubstep
Realmyst
Reikim: Pop Music, Hip Hop, "Bitchy" rap.
realmyst
BRB
Vordox: Screw it all. This is why I stopped using a radio long ago.
Right, attention now being paid to stream, what's going on?
Reikim: Radio, wazzat? :P
Meanwhile: Stuff
panda-drawing: you still there man?
Reikim: words of wisdom.
Vordox: Very helpful, thanks for that.
Meanwhile: Real Myst
Meanwhile: Minor discussion about art. Nothing important.
skeleton

Meanwhile: also in chat, discussion on art and the math.
Meanwhile: And gears, elevators...
otakon: That's the one Shizu is constantly plugging right?
eeyup
13i would constantly plug riven
well I think so
13but even less ponies here would get it..
Art and math. Wild conversation I'm sure.
It suddenly occurs to me that I haven't drawn anything in forever.
BORIING:O
13need more vivi x me art
More science types should learn about art, and vice versa
Bronies! What should I draw?
Reikim: jarnomiedema <--- Check this user's post

A pony
On the link I gave you before Reikim
Reikim: A squid eating a boat.

Well that's creepy.
Vordox: Impressionism is my favourite style. It suits my personality.
moustache ftw
Sirrus!
with a party wave cannon
Can't tell if suppost to be like that, or lip syncing is bad
Reikim: Impressionism is probably the most weird category in art
Vordox: Lies, non-objective and abstractionism.
Reikim: It has such a varying opportunistic ways =/
00,02red is sirus
00,02blue is achniea
00,02i cannot spell
00,02but yes
evening, everypony! :)
Vordox: No, wait. Dadaism. Clearly dadaism is the way to go for weirdness.
Achenar
00,02i figured that
Dadaism?
Phase4: I was expecting a poem there.
00,02XD
Vordox: I shit you not that was an art movement.
Reikim: ...What the fuck is Dadaism?
it's aiming for absurdity, Vordox
Oh
i forget what else.
those are stars eight?
That's fine, I like those. :P
It's like Bizzaro
right*
Or Monthy Python
BOOM
Keeeku
.......................................... I am trying to have a CONVERSATION here
Bustah keeku
Vordox: Intentionally nonsensical art. I think it took place around WWII, and was in part a form of protest against the war. You think modern art was weird? Dadaism laughs in the face of modern art.
:O I just remember I have Myst on DS - *runs to retrieve it* ^_^ Sleep is over rated!
Auto kick has nothing but scorn for your desire to talk to people.
How long is this game?
Vordox: I think Picasso may have shown up right at the tail end of it.
Red_Pegasus|Soviet: Got any examples?
Cypress I heard the DS port was like so tiny you couldn't see anything.
Reikim: Got any examples?
13depends how long it takes you to work out puzzles
Sorry Red_Pegasus|Soviet . Miseplled the tab
13you can speedrun it in like two minutes
13but that's because the last puzzle is a shortcut around most of the game if you know it from the start
Hm
yeah, it is - but its Myst
yup
Vordox: Flash crashed, shoot. So how do you like dadaism for strange?
Did you know it?
Raise your hand if you're sure you're safe from the DNS bug that'll affect people monday morning

I think this game si also available for ipad
Sumica?
00,10no, Phase4
Oh
Vordox: The world doesn't deserve art! We shall give it...anti-art!
Lightning-QUill: I think thats 100 floors
Reikim: You mean New Age modern art or what Unnr called it?
Mornin bronystate :3
Vordox: No, that was Dadaism. Also, Surrealism (which followed) is just as strange but with more point.
/me dat dari bot
Phase4: How much games do you have?
Reikim: I would call the New modern art...anti art if anything
00,02Red_Pegasus|Soviet, too many
Sho be do! - http://i46.tinypic.com/28lq4vt.png
Reikim: Absurdity of Dadaism has a point of being not anti art in itself.
Nope it is right here in the app market for ipad. I'm staring at it
00,10back to the rust moble again I see
It's bacon and Applejack!
Vordox: Then look at surrealism and be terrified.

All these message sounds remind me of my ex... :(
ponies in sweaters especially Twily
Vordox: And then there's postmodernism http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostModernism which came after modern but before the art you hate and which is why calling the art you hate modern art is inaccurate.
Reikim: I like surrealism...

I still have scars inside my mouth from the crappy braces I had...
stupid wires
Shizuka: might want to get that checked out

Oh but I do

Ponies47: Got a rare mount on WoW! :$
13previous two wisdom teeth did it too for the first week ish
Rave|Happy: Cool :3
13they get smoothed down with use and my cheek learns to get out of the way
11,01I never had my wisdom teeth removed. Never bothered me.
This would be a fun rollercoaster
Ah, time to calm down....
11,01In fact, one never formed.
/me takes a deep breath
Nittany_Discord, I haven't had any removed either
13yeah all four of mine have been coming in perfect
did u guys see the crush! Kill! Destroy! Swag! chant at bronycon?
Are we talking about wisdom teeth now?
I have scars in my lip too. One from getting hit by a car at 4 years old. And a dog almost ripped my bottom lip off
I had to get metal teeth
Everypony coping with the end of the internet?
Mine are all slanted, but don't cause trouble
College starts in 10 hours

It's been awhile since I dusted you! You must be diryt!

Shizuka: If it was then it was an art reference and I am happy.

Vordox: It's just a painting?
Hotdiggetydemon said on his Tumblr that he's releasing SWAG.MOV at the end of the year, you know what else is suppossed to happen at the end of the year (hint: it's the end of more than just the year)
Reikim: It's still abit of nudity to it. :P
13Phase4 is playing realMyst
Vordox: Ah, I'm sure the mods won't mind. Much. I mean, it's all artistic really.
00,10this reminds me of that time I comuted to black mesa
Reikim: Also...where the fuck did he come up with all these ideas and poses...
its the end of teh world
I checked RealMyst is available for ipad
Ohh that commuter train took FOREVER!
Vordox: Eh, Bosch was...not all there, to put it gently.
Shizuka, Ah, that's the game your raving on about?
13i rave for all the mysts
13except 3 and 5..
LightningDashFast I always knew the MOV series would have a hand in it somehow
13and 4 is stupid hard
I rode a TARDIS train once, it took me 20 years to get off... of course GMAN was driving but still...
eeyup
Reikim: No..
00,10that reminds me it's been almost a year i should check on mind of freman see if it has a new ep again.
You went in Statis?
I think I can see some of the things he wishes to put through
13Sumica: up to 42 now i think
00,10oh so 2 new eps
00,02two more
13think so
ha 42
/me is confuzzled
00,02THIS
Shizuka: I like 5. 4 apparently gets dumb at the end
whatcha playin?
Vordox: Yeah. He's kind of like that. By the way, that painting? The centre is supposed to be Heaven.
I enjoyed 3 - gave more insight on why Sirrus & Achenar's history
00,02is the kind of game that would benefit from todays tech and knowladfe
And turns into a Peter Gabril music video while you play Bejeweled.

Vordox: Left is the Garden of Eden.

Exile is really easy for most of it which is sort of :(
Vordox: Right is Hell.
Although Saveedro's story was a sad one
00,02if you were to put the same people on a game like this today
Reikim: Yeah, I figured that out
I really like Uru except for like
13Mesh: yeah the last pussle in revelation is just stupid...
00,02it would be that much better
that stupid firefly puzzle
13puzzle is spelled with Zs..
Lunar_Brony which is in the video game genre of...
00,02s/z/s/
13ah ja eder gire/kemo
00,10so this is just first myst with better framerate
13that one's easier on uru live
Z's???
13since you can get friends to gather the fireflies for you
00,02Sumica, yes
Reikim: I like the ear motif of pain. :D
IshBestPony Puzzle? IDK, ask a mod
Sumica: RealMyst? RealMyst is Myst 1 in like, real time, with not static rendered stuff
00,02i'm gona miss the ability to walk around in riven
Uru got creepy as hell.
Is Releeshan world shown in 5?
Vordox: The theory is that he suffered from tinnitus, much like Van Gogh.
Phase: Dude Riven's puzzles are so
amazing
Oh...
13at the end of 5 yes if you do the right ending
So I was right
O.o
the way they all come together
13yay the mysties are coming out of the woodwork :3
RealRiven would be amazing
13i have always been disappointed how little crossover there is between bronies und mysties
I feel the need to draw The Doctor-Derpy saying "Allons-y"
00,02Mesh, so i've been told, but static images is going to feel a little less real than realmyst
Okay, so me and a couple of friends are trying to do a podcast for youtube, and our first episode is about the Mane 6. We really want to make it a podcast that integrates our viewers more than just reading messages, and one of our "segments", if you will, is Questioneighre (Working titles). We call one of our contacts on our phone and ask them easy questions about the show to see if they're smart enough to guess r
Riven's static images look REALLY good though
So much purple
13hold that thought phase
00,02its not a dealbreaker
Also they're not static. A lot of them have animation
With the doctor and the Timepony metacrisis doctor
00,02Mesh, that will help a lot
Shizuka: :) Did you ever do the slide in Riven?
OrpheusAntony__: Erm...Are you new to Bronystate?
allons-y indeed
13http://tkj.vortalcord.net/imgbox/lvs08/39
Vordox: On a similar note, have you heard of Salvador Dali?
OrpheusAntony: I'm sorry, I can't go to it right now.
00,10one of theese days i will show the charicter creater on Tera just for chat reactions.
Reikim: Rings a bell
13the slide..

I'm renaming my self.
13i have memorized riven as well but i do not remember a slide..

Yes, Shizuka there's a slide in Riven - Let me make sure I get the island's name right...
OrpheusAntony__: I don't recall your name before, and advertising is kinda illegal here without a base of not being in the proxmity often enough. :P
yeah
i'm not advertising
13oh oh you mean the cart ride to crater island
00,02so
00,02two more
13where you get dumped into a dead wood chipper :3
i'm really just trying to get some questions to ask
OrpheusAntony__: Oh
OrpheusAntony welcome to bronystate, come and stay, unless you are a regular here disguised as a n00b in which case REVEAL YOURSELF!!!
Reikim: Ah, okay.
OrpheusAntony__: Well, go on, I kinda like the idea you are going for her. Might be some simple fun in that. :)

Holy crap...that's a lovely image

Better name than my old one
OrpheusAntony: Q1: What is the current gen of Mlp?
13not quite as much fun as jungle island, but let me explore my protagonist a bit
Reikim: It's just that you previously posted that you had "formal art training". My bad.
Shizuka: I never did catch that darn frog 6_9
Vordox: Salvador Dali also had one hell of a moustache. It's even better than Meanwhile's! http://www.mibba.com/data/images/content/people/men/salvador-dali.jpg
Man the frog trap puzzle was the one I never really got
has any pony seen AgentKalim on yet this week ?
Also closing the doors to get to somewhere but uh
13i learned to get the frog you set the trap and lower it, and at least have to get down the ladder outside
13then it'll catch
whos computer
don't think the frog trap is actually essential
iirc there's SOME redundancy in the animal hints
Can somepony tell me what the *yay* is going on?
13not really but helps you make the connection for the moiety book
Wormwood: Gosh no. That must have been a mistake on my part, my apologies. I haven't had formal training beyond the high school level, unfortunately. Art is not, I think, something I want to do as a career.
I'd place the bait, then go to another island, come back after a few hours and there still wouldnt be a frog in it
00,10Doom......er I meen myst
It has been forever since I played Doom
so no pony has seen AgentKalim yet
hey guys, how about...a CMC spin-off series??
Shizuka can you please give me a brief explanation of what's happening?
the music is scaryer thanjj abriggs
OrpheusAntony__: So this podcast, how far ahead on the plans are you?
Oh my gosh - the Whark! I just remembered the Whark ^_^
Lost Brony we are talking about Riven
Phase4: Do you have Spiral Knights?
Shizuka: Do you have references to your OC and Vivi's? Because I'll still draw them if you want.
derp
13Lost_Brony: Phase is wandering around looking for the marker switch to get access to Stoneship
whos this girl tara strong is talking about on her twitter?
Shizuka: Oh god stoneship
g´morning all
wait - is it Whark of Wharf?
I had my monitor brightness down too far in that
Reikim: Heh, I was just curious about your background in it art, being an artist myself.
checked a walk through
kiki?
13wahrk
Shizuka oh. What's Stoneship?
WHAT FUCKING SWITCH!!!?!?!?
13you will see
It's a girl with cancer
what firetrucking game is this
she personally know her
00,02Red_Pegasus|RedSpy, nope
Acknowledge me, give me attention and feed my ego if you didn't do that FBI check and still have internet
13i LOVE stoneship in realmyst
poor thing :(
Phase4: You should get it, it's a fun game.
It's sort of a shame that most of the companies trying to rip off myst missed the point completely
hey guys!
seriously
Wormwood: My background isn't as much as I'd like, but I still enjoy art as one of the few things that keeps me sane. What training do you have?
have any of yu heard of BAND OF BRONIES
I love this verion - the room isnt pitch dark

hey Shizuka, I sang a seapony parody of "Strawberry fields" would u like to listen to it?
Phase4 or Shizuka: we should play Elevator Source on Gmod one day.
Yes I have most of their music I might be missing one or two songs
*tries to remember how to raise the ship* Its been a couple years since I played this game
Reikim: Yes, It's really the only thing I want to do with my life.
may the best pet win won a award for most liked children song
I start College in 10 hours
good luck
I'll need it?
SUCCESS!!
Wormwood: Then do it! I considered art, but finally I decided that I'd rather pursue it as a hobby rather than a career. Much like my writing, actually. They provide counterbalances that maintaini my sanity.
bring derpy she will help u out
I unwrapped my chocoalte
:) Oh yeah, I remember now
THE DOCTOR FROM back to the future had a pony

Myst is also interseting in how metafictional it was
13my cutie mark is on my profile page
Myst 1 and 3 were basically about the relation between the writer and their art. In a very... literal way.
Thanks Shizuka. Your profile page?
YES panda-drawing thank you very much!
But there's also this... meta videogame thing going on.

13now...
13that door isn't waterproof...
Phase4: hes on a boat and its not moving at all and ive run out of things to say and
13how in the world did the book survive...
00,02Shizuka, magic
13snort snort
00,02blue pages
/me turns LightningDashFast into a taco
:D
also, Doesnt the solar system kind of move up and down? or the sun rather - while we spin around, we're also kind of wobbly
00,10time is an illiusion, lunch time doubly so
Shizuka SCIENCE!!!!1!!1
It's made of Nokia
nuuu i dont want to be a taco
SCIENCE!!!!1!!1 does things
00,10i am onna boat
You all are being ridiculous... the book is obviously a water bender
13take a look~
13it's in a book~
13a reading rainbow daaaaaash~
:) ^
XD
nuu i dont want to be a taco i want to be snacky though
father are you Science
(Rimshot)
:P
yes son, now we are a family
Shizuka I remember that old "Reading Rainbow" commercial. It was stupid
:D
sheee can be anythinggggg
scieeeeeeeeennnnnnnccccccceeeeee
Sumica: You mean "Amon a Boat"
Spaaaaaaaaaaaace
00,10till it exploded

/me is still very lost
/me also killed the chat

13look look
13it's rain rain <3
00,02o_O
Shizuka THANK YOU FOR BREAKING THE SILENCE!
13phase is starting to see the bad FOV now
00,02i pressed a button
/me hugs Shizuka
indeed
13dat button
wat am i hearing?
xD
13dat pump actually
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG I hope it wasn't what I first thought it was
:) And the water isnt a still picture ^_^ That makes my night complete
13unfortunately i don't think any of the water levels drop slowly enough for you to see them, you push the button and POOF water gone
Shizuka seems legit
13makes sense though, the pump station is far enough removed from the three things it pumps out and the tech at the time you wouldn't render water draining
13i love this bgm
it sounds nice
SCIENCE!!!!1!!1
I never saw a single drop of rain fall - all this was still pictures - only the sound of rain while the water drops were frozen in mid air :D
so whats the point of Myst again?

reminds me of Zelda
^
Quite Mysty in here, isn't it?

Inb4: My dad see's me wearing a brony. His first questions "Where did you get it, Who got it, what's with the horse and what's a brony? I tell him he either gets upset or is fine with it. He wouldn't dis own me but thats the way I see him reacting :3
hi Tassadork
hello Very_Lost_Brony how are you this evening

Tassadork kinda bored, so I'm gonna liven things up with . . .

<Ponies47> Inb4: My dad see's me wearing a brony.

Shit if I saw someone wearing a brony I'd have a LOT of questions.
Not becoming lost?
Mesh: Opise shirt
I derp. ALOT! -_-
Alpha-Omega I can never be lost with SCIENCE!!!1!!1
So science and lost brony are one in the same
Ponies47, is this a hypothesis or did it actually happen?
Polydunami|DoctorWho: My hypothesis
Alpha-Omega eeyup. I'm also Lunar_Brony, Canadian_Brony, and Zombie_Brony
anyhoo . . .
Y u so many names?
I'm going to wear this shirt on the first day of school

Science_Brony also multiple personality brony, apparently
My goodness. I'm Lightning-Quill I decided to change names. I like this one more
wow dat FOV
13i don't know why they thought it was a good idea to make it look like you're running around with a telescope on your face
Must have that shirt >:(
Tassadork I like to change my name often. Noramally, I'll use Lunar_Brony or Canadian_Brony. I use Zombie_Brony whenever I kill the chat (which is often)and Science_Brony for a good excuse to yell SCIENCE(!!!1!!1) randomly

Polydunami|DoctorWho not smokey, but PG is known as "The Bowl City" for a good reason
there are 3 pulp mills in the bowl, too
I see.

Just don't get too high you might not come down for days XD
You know, I have some friends who just recently moved to PG.
air is bad
they are saying 33C for me tomorrow... but work has AC at least
roads are worse
13you're looking for a switch up there, it's towards the middle of the huts
we have the 4th worst roads in the province
13it's just a bit of a maze up there, made worse by the narrow FOV
10th in Canada
Oh my
my area is getting better, though
... Well it's getting better for jobs up there...
I think
1 bad intersection and 3 awful roads got torn up in the past 2 months

11,02O.O
BRONY_4_LIFE that depends on what kind of fic you're looking for
11,02I could drive to his house and wake him up :P
*ahem* Shamroc... A SEXY FEMALE SWORDSMAN WITH A HUNK OF MEAT JUST SHOWED UP.

well i just reed my little dashie:'(
BRONY_4_LIFE tis the saddest story ever.
BRONY_4_LIFE: I actually could not finish it
BRONY_4_LIFE oh . . . *sniff*
I finished it
It's sad, yet I didn't cry.
It made me mad and sad
/me trys to navigate her way to the fireplace without bumping her nose against anything while she tries to rub her eyes
i did
There is a sequel but it is not made by the same person. Although I liked it
do what now?
You haven't shown up at Vancouver lately, Rain. That's very strange for Vancouver weather :S
hey a guy i know told me to read cupcakes it any good
O_O
NO.
[23:12] [wutweeaboo(+ix)] [1:ponychat/#geek(+JPgntz)]
eh, someone from Vancouver insulted my mum he did
I think it is the evil one about Pinkamena
so I just said "fine" and decided to not hang out with that guy
i got a tiny bit of rainfall...but it was a sprinkle..not allot
BRONY_4_LIFE do NOT read Cupcakes! It is the one thing that will ruin any happiness left in you and make you fear the sight of Pinkamena Diane Pie!
It probably wasn't me, I don't think I'd like to insult anypony's mum.
BRONY_4_LIFE: reading cupcakes is kind of a rite of passage for most bronies. but recommending it would be like hazing ...
BRONY_4_LIFE Listen to Canadian_Brony man... Just don't do it.
and it has pinkie pie
No I love Pinkie too much to let something like thgat change my image of her
proble a not a good idear i like pinkie pie
BRONY_4_LIFE all I can say is read at your own risk. It's rated Mature for a good reason on FimFiction.net. It has serious gore and a sick twist
i wonder why its called cupcakes
*shutters* ...you don't wanna know...
Buck that I'm not into that crazy *yay*
Flesh that is all
BRONY_4_LIFE you do not want to know
okey dokey lokey
/me shudders
I liek cupcakez :3
I've herd about it
:D
pinkie pie or rainbow dash is my fav pony
... but I'm not too big on the fic.
Just saying
I love everypony! :3
:O
a really funny story would be "Pinkie Learns a New Word". Basically, Pinkie learns the word f*ck. That is all I can say
the rest is history
They all hold a specail place in my heart :D
Oh my god, that's cute and quite vulgar xD
Ponies47 woo hoo! x3
i allmost forgot about drepy derpy is one of my favs 2
http://www.redbubble.com/people/stinkehund/works/7383789-i-have-a-crush-on-rainbow-dash-with-text?p=t-shirt
Canadian_Brony: To lazy to read it. So lets seee if I can find a reading of it :P
Yep, so I'm going to bed. SuperBrony64, I'm looking forward to the Back To The Future Trilogy this week.
Oho!
13ahh pattern 158
You mean this? http://www.fimfiction.net/story/24755/Pinkie-Pie-learns-a-new-word
13i know you well
wow
Ponies47 what, "Pinkie Learns a New Word"? Doubtful. Besides, it's only 3000 words
SparklyWaffles that be the one! ROFL, amiright?
dose anypony here like luna
Let's see... Phase4 plays and Shizuka directs... hmm?
YES
eeyup
LUNA!

I'm Canadian_Brony
Good morning Bronystate!
/me passes out and falls on Rain
Whoa, it's a flying yay!
Lunar_Brony: FOUND SOME READINGS! :D
Polydunami|DoctorWho I read that in the voice of Carrel Channing
Oh my
Good Night those that are falling asleep
Ponies47 really? Nice.
oof
lunar_brony who is your fav pony
...
Lunar_Brony: Ye. I'm gonna listen to it right now :3
BRONY_4_LIFE http://www.redbubble.com/people/stinkehund/works/7383789-i-have-a-crush-on-rainbow-dash-with-text?p=t-shirt
/me hugs Sumica
*yes
I'm falling awake :D
I'll be back in a couple of minutes.
/me hugs Rain back
Oh yeah. That's Carol Channing.
13rain rain~<3
if you are of a sciency bent and would like a good laugh, I highly recommend a little fanfic called "Naked Singularity" on fim fiction
Polydunami|DoctorWho the reason I heard it in the voice of Carol Channing was because it was from "Whose Line is it Anyway?"
/me hugs Shizuka tightly
I know, I saw that one xD
.....what is goin on in this chat..
Tassadork|melting I was considering that!
Shamroc EVERYTHIIING.
HEY Who wants to see an epic magic duel between Trixie and Twilight?
Shamroc: people falling asleep and early birds awakening :D
ok i have a question fo everypony
Shoot.
no
Hay away
Science_Brony: you can't go wrong
Shamroc well, I yelled "SCIENCE(!!!1!!1)" in your ear, put fresh bacon under your nose, and Fus Ro Dah'd you to wake you up. Nothing worked
On youtube how do these guys see ponies in real life?
Science_Brony: oh i know..if you looked the bacon is gone...;p
xxMoopyxx, video editing
xxMoopyxx Photoshop]
oh ok
how old are you?
You know, CrimsonPhoenix, that wouldn't be a very fair battle. Twilight would KILL Trixie.
he20
Polydunami|DoctorWho, http://i.imgur.com/wNT0W.jpg
i mean 20
No murder in MLP
im 20
Egad
Shamroc did you like it? It was Canadian bacon
brain activity slowly decreasing
So it was ham
... How do I know who's winning?
trixie playing aggro, twi playing control...
I know nothing about Magic.
13seems legit
Polydunami|DoctorWho, you know the magic rules
13x100
It would be a curbstomp battle. Trixie wouldn't stand a chance.
Polydunami|DoctorWho nobody knows who's playing in Magic. Especially the players
really?
madness i play healer
Heh i wish i can see ponies in real life without the photoshop stuff
... I know nothing about Magic.
dose anypony like g1 mlp
nope
xxMoopyxx yeah, me too . . .:'(
I dunno, haven't seen too much of it, BRONY_4_LIFE
Shizuka: both of the brothers in the books are lying, right?
BRONY_4_LIFE SHOO BE DOO. SHOO SHOO BE DOO.
I know plenty about magic... but not enough to ID those cards just by the card pictures
i want to go to ponyville so bad for real guys
Call on the Sea Ponies!
13what was your first clue :3
The animation is a little wack
BRONY_4_LIFE, SHOO BE DOO SHOO SHOO BE DOO

Shizuka: maybe we should find that father that they keep dissing!
Go green :D
13sirrus' rooms are the more lavishly decorated
13achenar is a bit nutty
BRONY_4_LIFE: indeed. the warning was given.

00,02k
00,02Shizuka, is there video for the green book?
13it's part of the book

ithat totaly ruined pinkie pie she killed rainbow dash
13you will see
BRONY_4_LIFE we warned you.
xxMoopyxx: in private chat you can post videos whenever you want
fanfic does have it's darkside
13oops
13um phase..
13you're supposed to listen to him first
i know that but does it count as a spam
13he specifically tells you not to come yet
BRONY_4_LIFE hey, I've read a story that turned RD into a psychotic shell of a killer
and you know me and RD
wow that is an amazing 2d slide
was it rainbow factory
BRONY_4_LIFE *cries*
13Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2: it's a video mapped onto a 3d model
D:
Canadian_Brony: I hate ALL grimdark fanfics
Shizuka: O_O
13kind of, his model is fairly low poly at this point
sweet, I got a strange Rainblower to go with my Strange Lolichop
i did not want to read that
13in myst 5 they way ramped up the technology
13and crashed into the uncanny valley >>
00,02interesting
13so yeah phase lost again :3
00,02very interesting
GG
00,02'le thinking'
WUT
13he specifically tells you not to come yet when you listen to him on the green book~

/me fluffs up her wings and lays her head down
Canadian_Brony: if you enter the green book right away, yes
/me 13curls up next to rain~
Nuts

/me smiles and drapes a wing over Shizuka~
13anyway there is one page left in the world~
Hey Flyboy!
00,02hopefully that wont happen every time
what were we playing?
shizu........
00,02Shizuka, i know where, lets see if i cant figure
That is Myst.
13:3
LOL
kablooie
13i have the clue photoshopped on my myst journal if you want to skip past the age hopping
it looked like doom :D
Not quite similar to my eyes...
Flyboy: not really
brb.
oh nvm then
Phase4: can u gift me counter strike source because a washing machine burnd me
... Yeah, that's nothing like Doom :S
i only saw it for a second though
Phase4: listen to what the green book says?
if it was Doom there would be guns,mars atmosphere, demons. i dont see any of that o_o
And hellfire.
and dont forget a BFG
And, of course, the HUD.
and no vertical look
00,02hmmm
00,02wait
13ding? :3
00,02Shizuka, you have to go through the ages to get it?
Dong?
is anypony else craving cuppcakes
13there was a torn clue
Dat fanfic was awesome :3
13one half in stoneship, the other in channelwood
Hm?
00,02Shizuka, i remember that
00,02cahnnelwood is...
13the trees
00,02ah
00,02Shizuka, link me?
13want to skip to my photoshopped version, it's just the two halves together
00,02dont realy want to run through channelwood again
By the way, i dont have much time on here
13http://tkj.vortalcord.net/imgbox/lvs06/00
13ding!
00,02Shizuka, is that the page or do i read it somehow?
13now listen to atrus first :3
00,02ah
13atrus who is in fact not murdered by either of the brothers :3
00,02yeah
00,02red guy said he wasnt, blue guy never actually said he was but implied it
um, did the chat just die?
._.
its always dead at this time
it's just very quiet...
fluttershy is so adoraball
BRONY_4_LIFE IKR?
Sorry I want to see the outcome
alls i see is a wall of phase and shizuka, and i thought something was up
*adorable
Rarity is fabulous :3
13doh
did it just go real time?!?!
13impatient phase...
13well anyway
I'm so hungry... ;-;
13atrus explains how the red and blue books were traps for greedy explorers, and always told his sons they were off limits
00,02and then we waited there forever
Magic 'Snort' 'Snort'
00,02the end
i cant decide who my fav pony is its to impossible
13nope still more
13also you missed his speech at the book
BRONY_4_LIFE They're all the best!
13here he sets up riven
eyeep
hmm
The Plot Thickens
13he's also unlocked rime for you which is pretty much exploration for exploration's sake, though there's an easter egg pointing at riven at the end
._.
13when sirrus and achenar started getting power crazy, they tricked atrus into coming here to D'ni with an incomplete myst book
so much pink.
13with atrus out of the way, they destroyed the library until the red and blue books remained
TOO MUCH PINK.
13and then WHOOOPS got themselves trapped
ARRRGH
Hi guys!! ^^

I didn't mind Derpy's new voice but I didn't like it when they changed her name and her eyes.
g'night Shamro
Morning everypony. What we watching?
Rather, REMOVED her name.
Hey FairysHuff, Phase4 is playing Myst :3

Okay, back to Doctor Who land I go.

I prefer Pyroland
Phase4: ill be back around 7 your time. Think you'd wanna play something then? :D
13pyroland has more rainbows~
i prefer the british isles ;)
Shizuka: and cute sounding soldiers and heavies and stuff.
I prefer sexy pony harem land. With socks.
heheh. it says erected
pyroland is bexst land
00,02z-fighting in the book XD
13lol that corrupted page
Flyboy It depends on my mood. I like both. Thigh high socks? Yum.
13iirc they're bink videos in this version, that would be video artifacts messing it up :3
FairysHuff: i prefer nothing at all :S
What're we playing?
13dat cot that gets reused how many times in uru...
00,02i know where 3 of those are
00,02not sure where last two are
13you touch the pads under the imager
FairysHuff ... really?
13let me save you the trouble http://tkj.vortalcord.net/imgbox/lvs06/22 http://tkj.vortalcord.net/imgbox/lvs06/23
13cause they're really finicky
AdamTheDuck Hey I didn't create it ^_^
-.(\
the internet never ceases to amaze me...
13phase is gonna play god for a while now :3
Flyboy this is a facehoof: -_(\
-_(\
I'm gonna play perverted old man for while.
o_o
FairysHuff that will get you kicked and banned
Canadian_Brony ...Does it matter? 6_9
I prefer human shapes, myself :/
and this is a hoofpunch: /)*(-.-)
SparklyWaffles not really.
13i like how the books aren't a pile of ash on the floow but a crater in the wall
Canadian_Brony I'm joking silly filly ^_^
/)_(\
13did atrus hadouken them to death?
hmm?
wut?
Canadian_Brony /)^3^(\
13anyway phase that second pic is a shot from riven, it's a continuity nod
00,02Shizuka, three of the crystals are on the age with the rotating fort right?
00,02ah
SparklyWaffles I can't think of anything else
13basically the crystal viewer takes five crystals of certain shapes and colors
Canadian_Brony Yes, i win!
13you click the pads to change the shape, and mouseover to change color
SO CONFUSING!
00,02oh
00,02i see
13when you recreate the combination on the note it gives that image, but it's stupid finicky
Flyboy is U confuzzled?
13revelation does the concept better
chat derp, or serious lag?
Canadian_Brony: maybe a bit confuzzled, yeah
/)^3^(\
-_(\
just here to check on you all anything new?
/) * ︵ ┻━┻
xD
I feel like glomping somepony . . .
I just found a pic of Twilight thats even more disturbing but I won't link it. ^_^
hey look i put my name in
o_o
Glomping?
hi Zach
Alpha-Omega yes. The attack-hug
/me glomps Alpha-Omega
13like i said it's just stupid finicky, you can barely tell the difference between green and cyan and that's enough to break the puzzle
FairysHuff: oh no go ahead, i can bet you ive seen worse
somepony better prepare themselves...
I haven't been on bronystate for a while~ Hi everypony :)
Hey Custard
SparklyWaffles for what?
most ppl know me as ChronoClutch but I didn't feel like typing it in except nao
Hi Custard :)
hi Custard
well have fun :P
Also, Hey Zaxh
*Zach
ahh assault
Canadian_Brony nothing. ;)
Flyboy More than likely. I remember the *ahem* Special anantomically correct plush that was linked here.
Zach I see. I am also known as Lunar_Brony, Zombie_Brony, Science_Brony, and Very_Lost_Brony
aaah... rught
right*
/me glomps SparklyWaffles
Canadian_Brony a man of many names
Zach that's me!
:O
This pic is nothing compaired to that plush pic.
SCIENCE!!!1!!1
00,02not sure if worked
k I will be back gunna watch season 2 episode 4 wof mlp fim
:O I was glomped.
13Phase4: in Riven, the Star Fissure is implied to be a void between Ages
That's a good episode.
13so presumably if you've entered a crystal combo that doesn't point anywhere
13you get the stars
SparklyWaffles yes. Yes you were.
What is this game?
Myst
00,02colours!
my name didn't change
00,02y u no more saturated
13this is the very end of realmyst
13ikr phase
Hmm... seems I can't link it as I get redirected to another site before it loads O-o Fucking internet.
Lunar_Brony Really? That looks way different from the Myst of my youth.
Language, my friend!
that might be a problem with your router FairysHuff
13Phase4: i think the second crystal is supposed to have a cut top, not the pointy one you have
far right
/me is too tired to care
AdamTheDuck Nah. It's only doing it with this one pic
ah ok
AdamTheDuck So more likely the site
far right to purple
Just as well I suppose.
Polydunami|DoctorWho Ahh, I see.
It's on steam.
00,02i love how the screen trolls you
13far right one needs to be purple
*gives Lunar_Brony energy pill* Stay awake!
00,02its soo close to purple
13ikr
13they didn't think this one through very well
its blue...
I just saw something I didn't need to see. ~_~ Rarity with all the girly parts added.
13there's riven~
click it!
13specifically
cliiick iiiiit!
13http://tkj.vortalcord.net/imgbox/lvs07/10 there
13but yeah that's realmyst~
SparklyWaffles what? Did I say I was tired?
Then stop looking it up
00,02so thats it?
00,02huh
00,02was kinda hoping for more in that last thing
13yup, myst kind of.. ends..
Uhh, is that pony-shaped or human-shaped, FairysHuff?
13riven picks up immediately after
00,02not bad
Lunar_Brony you said you were too tired to care. Thus, PROOF YOU'RE GETTING SLEEPY!
Polydunami|DoctorWho Kinda both.
13not bad for 1993 :3
00,0293?
!lottery glomp
Polydunami She's reclining on a bed
00,02this game is as old as me
13when original myst was done ja
"Glomp" is not registered .. .
It's older than me
-_(\
00,02for a 93 game to feel fun in 2012
00,02you know its a good game
well... that was very anti-climactic...
o.o
13<3
!lottery give Coca-Cola
00,02AdamTheDuck, was a bit
00,02but its a very calm game
why won't "!lottery" work?
13for you ponies who "myst" realMyst, plug plug! http://tkj.vortalcord.net/
I'm 13 years older than the game.
00,02Lunar_Brony, gameserv is turned off in here afaik
Phase4 aww, okay
You mean older games aren't usually fun, Phase4?
Polydunami I disagree with that statement.
well he didnt say that
Me too.
what about mario
13can you imagine how much power must be flowing through those things
13to make arcs that huge
why is he making the Aurora Borealis?
HAH HAH!! I found a safe one ^_^

again?
must be giving off a lot of radiation too/
it is exciting the molicules in the air, Lunar_Brony
13rime is so cold the ocean is like one big superconductor, iirc
00,02mattel interactive?
13they published realmyst
00,02Polydunami, they were fun when they were made
Don't forget the electro megnetism.
Rain I know, but why did he do that? And why are the credits rolling? I missed something
13i think they evolved from broderbund, where myst was published originally
I have no idea :p
did the game end?
13and one of broderbund's spinoffs published riven
00,02i liked that
13yay~<3
00,02was definantly worth buying
Phase4 I missed something. What was with the credits?
did you win?
00,02i clicked the about realmyst button
I'll get the ipad version
00,02i won
00,02kinda
00,02i solved the puzles and wasnt trapped there forever
13impatient ponies can go here http://tkj.vortalcord.net/journal/lvs07
hmm i said My Little pony on Cleverbot, it said thats a fantastic show O_O
13yes i am relentlessly plugging my writing...
I wonder if the cases of people who live under power lines getting cancer and other health issues are true. There has been quite a lot of them so not all of them can be fake. And not all of them can be flukes. CUrious.
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2 clever
Hallo Kammerjunk
00,02bit low on space
FairysHuff it's possible there could be a connection, but IDK
00,02theres 5GB left on that partition
13oh my
13how can you stand it ><
I don't feel like scincing right now
http://logs.omegle.com/88b322
Lunar_Brony Yes. It takes study that companies aren't willing to invest in.
*sciencing
00,02Shizuka, ~90% of my drive is alocated to linux
gtg in 7 minutes
13oh there is that
i really need to move my pron to an external drive(to free up space)
so did you finish it?
00,02i finished it
I have a terrabyte of memory on my computer
90% of my drive is allocated to anime and games.
sonovabitch i missed it
00,028 hours of gameplay
13cause shizu kept spoiling .-.
oh i see!
realmyst leads up to riven
am i right
13yes myst led directly into riven
:)
13or rather, riven, when it was released 4 years later, picks up immediately where myst leaves off
13exile is some 10 years later, revelation 10 years after that
13uru and 5 are present day, some 200 years after the first four
Correct me if I'm wrong but power lines create a strong electro magnetic field right? Not too strong but strong enough.
00,02gota stand up for a while
/me 00,02hugs Shizuka
/me 13hugs phase~
13glad you liked~<3
silly FairysHuff, only magic can create forcefeilds :)
Anyone mind if I link a youtube music video? Not mines.
sure
nope
http://youtu.be/liHq08Cayp4

So you re not the one pretending to be BronyState?
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG why? You can post video links when there's no stream
its Shed.Mov
Alpha-Omega no. I saw the name, though
Interesting
It's a CONSPIRAMACY!
I'm guessing because of the gore/violence?
Hrafn that will do it
*sneeze*
Hey I have a question to the people who stream here. What do you use to stream to mips.tv? Because I am trying to use xsplit and its not registering mips as a site it can stream to

Hello everypony!

00,02top gear is on tv
00,02distracted
08,01i'll need to find time for it, though
08,01because until BUCK, I can't, then after BUCK, i'm planning on going to Sweden for a week or so
08,01so that Wrek can draw me like one of his French fillies
O_O
08,01this reminds me of a song
00,02needs more spike
Ugh... The repetition! :|
ikr
well this gets boring after a few seconds
gives me a headache
08,01# dae yer tats hang lo, dae they wabble tae an' fro? / kin ye tie 'em inna knot, kin ye tie 'em in a bow? #
I dont speak scottish
08,01read it out loud
08,01it's just scottishised english
hey Alchemist hows your day bene
I'm afraid some of that is getting lost even after saying it out loud. :D My english knowledge is declining rapidly... :(
08,01heh
/me hugs Alchemist
hi alexxm :) its been, uneventful...
08,01which bits are you having trouble with?
08,01this is linguistically interesting
alexxm: was about to go to a job interview but the interviewer moved the appointment to wednesday.
Alchemist whats the interview for
Alchemist: Need some help with your english? :D
alexxm: chemical engineer assistant at a fur and leather factory. Hope PETA wont find me... :)
well Alchemist good luck wednesday then
Alchemist: Sounds pretty neat :)

08,01Phase4: nothing; i've never really had cause to use flash for anything
00,02well i intend to replace it with ajax
dae yer = they are?
08,01dae yer = do your

00,02suddenly it makes sense

yep thats what i got
yay :)
08,01# kin ye weech 'em past yer shoulder, like a giant wi a boulder, dae yer taaats haaang looo #
00,02what i want to know is wether a flash embed considers its local domain to be the domain its hosted on or the domain its embeded in
08,01weech = to chuck
00,02problem is i have no way to test
00,02unless
08,01pronounced like "week", but with the "ch" as in "loch"
08,01as in "jobby weecha"
bye guys

Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: uuh couldnt see that from your name ;P
08,01that's a song about flinging sandwiches out the window of a high-rise flat
XAX: Me and my roommates dont clean that often either...
Alchemist: Nah, it's just really thin and hard. Like it is as old as the house.
08,01# I'm a skyscraper wean; I live on the nineteenth flair / But I'm no' gaun oot tae play ony mair / 'Cause since we moved tae Castlemilk, I'm wastin' away / 'Cause I'm getting' wan meal less every day #

08,01this probably isn't as funny to you lot
08,01but let me give you a brief backgroudn
08,01i'm from a place called Fife
08,01which is a county in Scotland
08,01directly north of Edinburgh
08,01people from Edinburgh hate Fife
apparently Canterlot Gardens is near where i live, sucks im not gunna go
08,01hell, even *i* hate Fife
:D
08,01even though i'm from there, i'm at heart an adopted Edinburgher
08,01it's called the Kingdom of Fife, technically
08,01and Fifers are very proud
08,01except me
08,01i hate the place
08,01basically, if you've read Discworld, it's like Scrote
08,01it's where all the counry's produce comes from
08,01they're all farmers there, basically
08,01and people on the dole
08,01oh, yes, and St Andrews...
08,01my god: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5n0psmQdMo

hi Phase4. Somehow I can't get on bronystate; Error messege ''502 Bad Gateway''|cloudflare-nginx

but yeah, I have the link if anyone's interested, but it's all in Swedish :P
08,01i'll be thinking about you.

00,02DeadpoolDash, webserver
00,02huh
Ooh, better talk with my parents and see if we can work it out :D
00,02leave it for a few minutes, that might be its anti-bad stuff thing

all teh tabs
00,02DeadpoolDash, its absurdly few actually
how many is alot?
00,02~400
00,02average is around 200
why would you have that many open?
00,02most of them not needed of course
00,02lazyness
00,02cbf closing them and its quicker to have one in memory and use the navbar to jump to it than load it again
00,02 long l = System.currentTimeMillis();
00,02 long l2 = l + 0x5265c00L;
00,02 long l3 = l + 0x36ee80L;
00,02yay for.... whatever that is
I try to stay below 10, fiefox gets all buggy with more then that and starts eating memory
00,02odd,
Phase4, how do I stay on the things when on a surf map?
00,02on my old laptop it took at least 50 tabs to break 700MB
they like to just let me slide off to my death
00,02Rain, use left and right
00,02push into the angle
I do :|
00,02i'ma join your server

08,01Phase4: rewrite the entire thing in Haskell
00,02i'm on 81.166.125.12:20300
00,02just a little too different
08,01i love haskell
go lisp!
haven't seen much haskell outside of academia
/me 08,01works in academia
08,01this is why i like haskell :P
/me is a student
yup love haskell as a language :D
08,01hahaha <3
I can implement many algorithms in it..
but beyond that..
you still there
can't think how I'd implement some application in a 'pure' way
Good morning everyone
08,01AMAZING book
08,01examples in ML *and* Haskell!
Phase4: you still there
00,02yeah
00,02hmmm
00,02i just realised that being > 18
00,02i have access to money
00,02and can buy books
I don't know any graphical haskell application except xmonad
whats the ip for the server?
81.166.125.12:20300 maybe
Morning my pumpernickle ponys.
Well its morning kind of for me as I just got up
08,01shana: there are some *excellent* graphic and animation drawing libraries for Haskell
Hi FairysHuff!
MadSurge Holla
MadSurge Hows yee?
that aint the ip
Phase4: you got the ip for the server your on?
00,0281.166.125.12:20300
00,02i think
tried it already
00,02nope
00,02203.34.186.32:27075
08,01shana: sometimes
08,01i wrote an implementation of RSA in Haskell
hmm doesn't haskell have a native bignum library?
Phase4: There's bound to be something on CSS you'd like. Theres craploads of gamemodes.
isn't that hard then ^_^
00,02XAX, but soo much download
Allos all!
08,01eeyup
00,02DAT SLAPS ME ON DE KNEE
Phase4: Not every server has store and all that crap. It's only maps really.
08,01and, to be honest, writing RSA in haskell was beautiful to write
Anyone got any advice for Apps to get for Android? Not games.
08,01i love writing algos in haskell
But yeah, some maps are big :$
yup it is
00,02thats a heck of a turn you have to make on this map
Phase4: You back on TF2 again?
00,02XAX, yeah
00,02yay
00,02level change
Phase4: Oh yeah, Surfing started in CSS. I could find a decent Surf server tomorrow. An Australian one :p
00,02:D
00,02that'd be good
Wait. Not just CSS. It started in the valve engine in general.
Rather quiet today no?
I like a good mix of functional programming and imperative
There were CS 1.6 surf
/me maps
Dafuq why did that /me
well what did you type?
XAX: lol
oh god that Holy mackeral head glitch
Oh by the way Phase4, you'd be surprised how much skill that skill surf maps actually take. They're fucking impossible some of them.
00,02yeah
00,02like the previous one
When you have time, YouTube search "surf_overgrowth"
that shit's amazing
00,02XAX, HOLY
00,02i'm jelly
00,02dat guys got skills
00,02allso not posible to do that on touchpad
Yeah.
I've actually talked to the guy who made that map
00,02very precise
Deepest voice you'll ever hear lol
00,02he's screwign up actually, the video i have
00,02lol
Phase4: I asked him what sensitivity he used to surf. 0.3 apparently.
His mousepad must take up half his desk.
00,02huh
00,02yeah
00,02need the precision
Another CSS video I'd recommend is "phoon too much for zblock"
that's the definition of rape via "game mechanic abuse", according to Shamrocs lol
00,02huh
00,02getting 100fps while streaming
00,02dats new
mmm CSS source engine abuse
Unnr: You watching it? :o
00,02dat sllaps me on the knee
=_=
00,02i have k bound to explode

Morning, everyone
Hiya AttacktheAndalite. Welcome back Princess_Molestia.
He, XAX
Why is the chat dead?
ded
=_=

Boobs

/me begins the process of making Spaghetti and cheese toasties.

Good morning everypony
Good morning Twilight_S

Atler_Tempest: try google
00,02i'ma stop streaming soon
Dead? Who told you that?
Atler_Tempest: what phase was streaming.
Unnr|Shower: i dont watch the stream anymore...
Its pretty much a game play mode based on abusing physics
btw was bronystate down earlier today?
Bronysith said your little brother told him, then Bronystate.
Im going to kill him!
sprinkle_GS17: The CS GO beta makes me scared for the next generation of CS. T__T

He's lucky he's on vacation, or Id kill him!
...
hiya guys!
Wel........ok
Unnr|Shower: hm i never played that, how long has it been out?
my second day :)
never liked CS... never will... another FPS that i can do without...
Well, I gotta go, I just wanted to say hello to everypony before I left
sprinkle_GS17: is still in closed beta
see ya Twilight_S
Chat is beginning to come to life I see. Was completely dead for a long while.
Unnr|Shower: howd you get your hands on it?
Goodbye Twilight_S
sprinkle_GS17: Magic. *snort* *snort*
Atler_Tempest: CS is better than most fps today. and it was made by valve!
Unnr|Shower: i smell shenanigans
not so much better as more brutal and a bit more rewarding for precision play
^
sprinkle_GS17: just cause it was made by valve, doesnt mean i have to like it... ive played it and i hate it... feels a bit to CoD at time to me...
yeah, CS is fun and balanced
Atler_Tempest: lol except that its been out way before COD
CS... balanced? Do we play the same game?
so...who likes pie :D
morning, everypony! :) *yawns*
G´Morning! o/
hai Sylandest
sprinkle_GS17: -shrugs- its just another FPS that people over glorify... im not saying it bad, i just dont like it...
howdy, Unnr|Shower, sprinkle_GS17

Atler_Tempest: im not a big fan of shooters, but i do enjoy a bit of it occasionally
so Unnr|Shower i take it you didnt like cs:go? why not?
hi everyone
/me noms on Phase4
hi Lil_B and EVERYPONY
howdy, Lil_B, and Bronysith
Good morning everypony.
sprinkle_GS17: and that new CS: GO... well... why are they making that and not Episode 3... CS: GO might turn into a BF style game, and that could be bad...
/me nuzzles Phase4[nommed].

Hi
hi
lawl
/me trows random lawls around
=_= seriously... why is there all this drama over something that was probably some shitty prank to begin with... how about everyone stop giving a fuck about this and get on with important shit...
Atler_Tempest: they did cause teh chat is dead
this is why i tend to only lurk now... too much drama and too much attention whoring... ffs...
Atler_Tempest: indeed
It wouldn´t be BS without drama, though. BS is like the highschool cafeteria of ponychat
Unnr: well its still anoin for many people
well for me not
cause i dont care
but others
that care
http://www.damnyouautocorrect.com/25192/time-to-move-out/

^More like anarchy central
awww... I just watched the coffee machine get taken by the training group - how am I supposed to make it through the day today...
04Hello once more
hi Ghosties
morning, sir Ghosties
/me nuzzles Ghosties.
Morning, Ghosties
indeed Ghosties
hi Ghosties
Ghosties: you got somethin i should draw you yet? :P
04Not yet, Violet
04But thanks again
04So, how is everyone?
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-tell-me.jpg
fine Ghosties and you?
04I just killed an innumerable amount of people in Deus Ex Human Revolution. This morning started off well.
08,01lulz
Ghosties: pretty well, just writing some code here at work (bummed that the coffee machine was stolen my training)
04Writing code? Where do you work?
Ghosties: The company is rather small, but I write code.
Bronysith: gender issues, dumb male is better than klutzy female
Morning in Paris, the city awakes to the bells of Notre Dame. The fisherman fishes, the bakerman bakes to the bells of Notre Dame.
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-ill-stick-with-ponies-thanks.jpg
Kammerjunk: good song is good
Bronysith: I concur.
(no offence Ghosties... I'd just rather not say, I hope you understand)
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-what-is-this-i-dont-even.png
04Lol is it another brony site or something?
Ghosties: no, it has nothing to do with MLP sadly, but that doesn't mean I don't wear my brony wristband and have RD on top of my monitor...
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-that-awful-moment-when-paranoid-parrot-kicks-in.jpg
04So then you must work for some super serious company :o
Ghosties: he works for unatco
Bronysith: I heard they only get lemon lime and not orange in their soda machines
04So he either never asked for it, or it's a shame he did.
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-i-guess-it-was-too-important-to-rename.jpg
Bronysith: Ghosties You two get 100 internets eachs
each*
WOOT Ghosties /)
04(\
04Is there a stream going?
Nope
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-you-love-ponies-too.png
this happened to me before actually
eek
/me glomps and licks Jim
Bronysith: people humming pony songs? :D
Ohai!
I got a brohoof at the airport once (in front of my parents - they were very confused)
Hullo Jim!
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-rainbow-scout.jpg SCOUT
Dashie is best Scout.
yes she is
or is it scout is best rainbow dash?
or is scout best pony?
04So anyways
04http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc6PommZKWQ
Bronysith: a chick I know tagged me into an FB Fluttershy pic as a joke and I was like "so you like them, huh? :$"
Ghosties: dont spoil anything for me on deus ex
Ghosties: still playing it
Ghosties: Yeah R.I.P
I never asked for this
hi everyone, does somebody want to hear a arrangement I made?
04No no, it's just a parody music video for Deus Ex
04To be fair, I've never even beaten the original
The old Deus Ex, even (There were only 2)
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-feel-the-love-and-tolerance-welling-up-inside-you1.jpg
Ghosties: should i get human revolution? i am enjoying the original
04YES
04HELL YES
it will most likely go on sale on the steam summer sun celebration sale
then ill get it
I have beaten all three games
hows the new pony going
:D
04You can't do a completely pure pacifist run like in the original Deus Ex, unfortunately, but aside from the bosses you don't have to kill anybody.
can't wait for the sales
hey everypony
hi TheKoreanBrony1354
04The biggest setback for me is lack of New Game+
hi TheKoreanBrony1354
Steam Summer Sale, the Bringer of Poverty
my wallet is not prepared
whats streaming
Kammerjunk: you mean the fixer of the economy
Ghosties: same for Shadows of the Damned :D
The bringer of candy bars to Gabe Nevel
i like apples
reminds me... I wanted to play Killing Floor for the Summer Sideshow :/ that game is really fun XD
Never got into it.
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-well-we-know-it-starts-with-a-p.png PORTAL
Bronysith: twitroll :D
Oh, but didn't you watch the video from Equestrian Innovations? There is a portal.
On the Moon.
The cost for getting there "falls in the ballpark of a lot of money."

Assuming the multiverse exists, though, there is a universe for every possible situation.
eat some doritos and muffins
Bronysith and according to the angle of which Twilight actually sees the nebula, Equestria is somewhere directly between earth and horsehead nebula
Bronysith: that's some badass Fluttershy <3
Again, theory of multiverse.
fluttershy the BAMF
these guns remind me of the shotgun in Teeworlds
Lil_B: It's a "WST-EM Combat Shotgun".
Seriously, that picture is DETAILED.
is he like playing call of duty
Kammerjunk: WOO WREK that's the best thing he's ever done :D
MadSurge: Seriously, if you zoom in, you'll see imprints on the goddamn cartridges.
That's attention to detail.
Or shells, or whatever.
04Wrek loves guns
Kammerjunk: I wish he made more of that and less fishnet ponies :D Only a little less
great, wrek is not only good at drawing on a Tablet, hes also skileld in Vectors :( why do I not have a Telent :(
04He's crazy about 'em
Ghosties: you dont say
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-you-dont-attack-the-scootaloos-in-zelda.jpg zelda
Bronysith: Revenge of the Scootabuse.
Wreks gotta gun fetish?
Ghosties: I love only impractical guns that shoot crazy stuff :D
Litwick: everypony has a gun fetish
Bronysith: I GET IT :D
04I wonder if Wrek has Borderlands
04He'd probably cherish that game
yea
most likely
04I've got the GOTY edition and I've only completed one DLC for it
04It's pretty damn expansive, gotta admit
yea
borderlands was pretty good
Played it once over at a friend's place, didn't really catch me.
its just diablo with guns
have a very fun gun http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BfU-wMwL2U
04Unlike most people I've talked to or most reviews I've read I actually preferred Single Player instead of Co-Op or Multiplayer
Ghosties: I finished the whole package, it's a pretty good game! My fav gun is a machinegun that shoots really fast and has infinite ammo :D
Hey, I played Mass Effect 3. I want a goddamn harpoon gun in real life.
Ghosties i beat borderlands single player

Just felt the need to share this
/me noms on FairysHuff
Bronysith Holla
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-even-the-most-interesting-man-in-the-world-cant-hide-his-bronyism-forever.jpg
howdy, FairysHuff!
Sylandest Hallo
Ghosties Thugification?
/me snuggles FairysHuff "How are you today?"
04It's a term being used by many legitimate anthropologists today, though it was coined originally by Tupac
Sylandest Angry but trying not to be.
04"Thugification" is when a man or woman has to turn to street crime just to get by
Why are all my Valve games recieving updates? Even the ones I haven't installed?
/me holds FairysHuff "Why are you angry? :O If I may ask"
08,01Ghosties: i love language
Lil_B: its the awesome update
Ghosties Ah yes... I know that well. It's getting more common here.
Lil_B: whenever you download valve games. they update the awesomeness
08,01i love how new words can come from surprising places
04Yeah, linguistics can be fun. My best friend is getting his Master's in it
Bronysith but I don't have Half live our counter strike installed? how can they be updating?
08,01who here knows what i mean when i say "polari"?
Lil_B: valve is just that awesome. enjoy
08,01aye
08,01well
Sylandest Just humans and their bullshit. If I could I would wipe them out. Start over.
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-words-of-wisdom.png
08,01polari is gay slang used in the 50s and 60s in britain
08,01because homosexuality was still illegal at this point
08,01so they had this sort of in-code dialect to tlak about gay stuff
/me cuddles FairysHuff and nuzzles "I'm sorry that you're mad...you gonna be alright?"
08,01it's actually where many commonly used words today came from
im going to get some bacon jalapeno cheese bread./ brb
Sylandest Yeh thanks. *Cuddles* I've been angry a lot lately. Don't really know why
hmmm... Legend of Pegasus is ready for Pre-Ordering on Steam... I have seen Trailers and they looked interesting... must observe
FairysHuff: You should totally play "I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream". I think you'd like it.
FairysHuff: If you ever need somepony to vent to, I have an ear to listen :)
Ghosties Can't say I blame them.
04Kammerjunk: FUCK YES
08,01i'm trying to think of an example
nvm. my asshole of a dad is up there
08,01but i actually can't
04Great story
Ghosties: I love that game.
Hey guys, sup?
Ghosties: hate? let me tell you how much i hate humans
Sylandest Thanks ^_^ *Hugs*
08,01Kammerjunk: i love that story
go to hell DarkStar
/me hugs FairysHuff back tight :)
04HATE. LET ME TELL YOU HOW MUCH I HATE HUMANS.
Wha?
Ghosties: if you were to write HATE
You lied about my death, thats low
good damnit, now I have "Night of Nights" Stuck in my head :(
.......
Ghosties: there are over 500 million miles of paper (sorry forgot exact number) in my circutry
I REGRET NOTHING!!
Ghosties: if you were to write HATE on every nano strand upon those hundreds of millions of miles of paper with HATE, that would not equal 1 1 billionth of how much i hate humans right now
04So much hate~
Love and Talerate ;)
Yah know I often wonder about how to create a new sort of society or rebuild one that was better than our current one. But I'm just one pony, I can't do it alone and I don't have the faith in other ponies to get over their own greed.
if you havent already. heres the link to that great story http://www.surfturk.com/endoftheworld/ihavenomouth.html
I get the feeling Meanwhile would like AM.
Bronysith Right there with you.
im re reading this story
I try not to think about these things as I know theres nothing I can do and I'm ashamed by that.
04It's good, I'm a big fan of "I Have No Mouth, And I Must Scream"
04AM is just the most evilest, vilest, most purest form of hate ever
Ghosties: id rather have skynet take over than AM any day
Ghosties: wait? he only feels hate...
04Yes
04He's sentient but he hates that all he feels is hate
/me has the realization rage face
ill brb after some breakfast
04I wouldn't be surprised if he's jealous of the humans for being able to feel something other than hate
FairysHuff Since some years I'm wondering how to make a state in which everyone has the same chances, the problem just is that there are way to much people on earth to tread each and everyone correctly and to net let them hate each other...
Ghosties: dont spoil the rest of the story. havent read it in a while
04I won't
ITT hate
FairysHuff but I think we can agree that it is defenetly possible to make the earth at least a little bit better so it doesn't get worse
Kammerjunk: except worse
Well, yeah.
http://youtu.be/TQmz6Rbpnu0
FairysHuff: You killed the chat :O
who
killerpony7733 Needed to be done.
00,03Gentlemen...
I smell chicken
hey Scoot-Scootaloo mlmg
GentleScoot
04Mentlegen
gentledragons
Yet even after such a speech nothing changed. Why am I not surprised.
/me nuzzles Scoot-Scootaloo.
FairysHuff: Human nature in it's best
killerpony7733 Yup. *Sigh* Makes me sick.
master Scoot-Scootaloo, welcome
Once a week, we throw a party here in chat. Once a week, BronyState will stream this and that! Ev'ry mod's anew and all anons are mods! That's the way on Penny Pony day!
...I'm watching the Hunchback from Notre Dame again.
Kammerjunk: youdontsay.jpg
04I dunno what planet you come from, Kammer, but I don't think "Penny Pony Day" is gonna happen on this site :p
hai guys
btw that video is from 1992
Yeah, me either.
ohai Chrysalis
Topsy Turvy just didn't fit.
Kammerjunk: Well you come from the same country as me :D
Oh right, there are actually other Danish bronies.
What, 2 dozen?
Kammerjunk: From what i get we are the only two actual regular danes here
Figures. For all our freedom, this country is so condemning.
How many of you would be willing to give up what you have, move to a new area and help build a new society with nothing in return but a place in that new society? I'm serious. I've been thinking about it a lot over the years.
Or maybe that's just society in general.
FairysHuff: Depends on the society.
FairysHuff: If you can make a actual fair and equal society i would do that
Kammerjunk A society that looks and plans long into the future and not for the immediate personal gain.
Ha ha. Humans treating each other fair.
^
04^^
04Seriously, ain't gonna happen
^^^
04As long as two people with separate opinions exist, it ain't gonna happen
If I could just get 10 people together to start such a society it would be something.
04You're already asking for too much. Ten? Yeah, there's so much room for disappointment there :/
This is why i'm intrigued by the idea Deus ex 1 had and it's not so successful sequel has
Well, I'm all for an equal society, but I'm 16.
imo its more cuz of egoism. people focus too much on good life, for us life has become about pleasure
and that makes people arrogant and self-centered
life has become more about ponies
Our society is all about what we can get NOW and screw what happens later.
I want to change that.
Ever sat down, and think to yourself "What has lead to this?"
Jim Greed
<Jim>	life has become more about ponies
Societies today are all "everyone are entitled their own opinions" until two people disagrees.
FairysHuff: Yeah you should see the current danish goverment everyone is bashing everyone and our prime minister cause ALL want a god damn piece of the pie to make changes to the tax law that's currently in play
Then it becomes a battle on who is most right.
killerpony7733 Yes. I try so hard not to think about it.
killerpony7733 Yet it's on my mind constantly. I can't get rid of it
Princess_Molestia: darkstar is the same person
Princess_Molestia and darkstar or whoever it is have been trolling me the whole time
to both of you
i say go to hell
killerpony7733: But hey, the Danish government is not all bad. I've had many fits of laughter from Villy Søvndal.
why do cats have such sharp clwas? theyre painful:S
Dovah: Because they love to sink them into soft human flesh when you just want to pet them.
Dovah: better than dogs with jaws that can kil lyou
But I am serious about starting a new society. I'm not arrogant or foolish enough to believe that I could lead it. Is it so wrong to want change that your willing to do it yourself no matter how bad you may think you'll be at it?
Kammerjunk: Not all bad sure, It's just how stupid and idiotic everyone is our goverment was made on a steady idea of being friends despite different ideals even within the current ruling goverments body
FairysHuff: you cant do it without finding another planet or creating a revolution on this one
Oh, what hath mankind wrought?
sprinkle_GS17 Or buying a small plot of land to start with.
"only the dead have seen the end of war" plato
"If you are young and not liberal, then you have no heart; but if you are old and not conservative, then you have no brain" winston churchill
"I hate war as only a soldier who has lived it can, only as one who has seen its brutality, its stupidity" Dwight D. Eisenhower
FairysHuff: wont work for long, that tiny little microcommunity will be dependant on the world around it
wait FairysHuff is planning on starting a revelution and starting a new country/sociaty? awesome I wanna help!
revelution...cant tell if wrong spelling or awesome new word
sprinkle_GS17 True, which is why I am scared to trust others to help. Some will have goo intentions while others will want to twist it to their own ends.
sprinkle_GS17: thats ok niether can i
FairysHuff: Actually, it's possible to buy your own island.
Costs a metric ton of cash, though.
Kammerjunk Yes. If you have millions.
...It's also possible to buy an abandoned nuclear silo.
And live there.
FairysHuff: i meant more along the lines of food n stuff being shipped from the mainland, the microcommunity will still be completely controled by the other countries
Kammerjunk I looked into that last year
and back.
Kammerjunk Too much money
Quite.
sprinkle_GS17 Such things take time to establish unless you intend to start a war.
FairysHuff: time wont even help, youll still have either a very small amount of people, or a tiny microcommunity which will require materials from the mainland
FairysHuff: and by small amount of people i mean like 10-20 max
sprinkle_GS17 Not if it's done right. It would mean sacrificing much of our modern luxuries.
sprinkle_GS17 Like medicine.
FairysHuff: lolwut.
FairysHuff: medicine is hardly a luxury
FairysHuff: without medicine your island will just die and thatll be that
Speaking of medicine, are there any actual good arguments against health care in the US?
Kammerjunk Apparently it's socialist and therefore evil according to the republicans.
sprinkle_GS17 As would I. But thats your view. Not mine.
FairysHuff: Well, anything is socialist if you look deep enough.
Silly republicans.
Kammerjunk You'd be charged with treason ^_^
Mea maxima culpa.
i can barely see twi there
Come on guys, stop with the cynism! One can dream right?
MadSurge Not in this day and age
i liked Nagatos(Pain) views on life
thoughtpolice says no!
hi bronies! :)
AM will be all the madder for that. It makes me a little happier. And yet … AM has won, simply … he has taken his revenge …I have no mouth. And I must scream.
Hope is the equivalent of sticking your head in the sand these days.
hoi derpy_pony
hi derpy_pony :)
derpy_pony: RUN AWAY, CYNISM TOOK OVER
is this live?
Speaking of Latin, I'm starting to get the feeling governments are doing malum gratia malis.
That image, dawww
I invented cynism, MadSurge
adorable
Cynicism today is just Realism.
The two aren't mutually inclusive, though.
^
cynism just means desillusionment
can be healthy from time to time
but...life goes on, new things happen
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-untitled.png
derpy_pony: The show must go on.
and it's awesome :D
Kammerjunk Until the curtain comes down
Speaking of nothing relating to anything we've talked about today, I am surprised at how tired I'm not.
/me Freddie Mercury stance
mfw when im in a good mood for once and suddenly everyone around me is cynical. is it opposite day or someth
Whos streaming btw? VioletVanilla?
sprinkle_GS17: I'm never in a bad mood!
Oh hey, Daft Punk.
Digital Love?
Kammerjunk: im always in a bad mood...except today
being in a bad mood is boring
sprinkle_GS17 Nah. I'm always like this. I just don't voice it much cause people get angry when faced with the truth.
Or maybe Something About Us.
Kammerjunk: cause Roger won Wimbledon yay
I always mix the two together.
sprinkle_GS17: ...Pardon?
derpy_pony: Ikr, you can be cynical, but not all the time!
Kammerjunk: nevermind, its tennis :3
funky
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-condescending-brony-wonka.jpg
also, making long term plans or societal analysis in bad mood always fails
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-my-little-mass-effect1.jpg
Yeah, I'm fairly certain this is Digital Love.
Except it's not.
hi guys!
hi Flyboy :)
It's totally Something About Us.
hi Flyboy
who's as
hi Flyboy :)
who'se streaming*
I take it that it's VioletVanilla streaming?
The Discovery version, I'd wager.
sounds like vivi, yes
And not that Musqiue Volume whatever piffle.
yeah, i thought it might be vi
Well VioletVanilla if your the one streaming thanks for choosing this soft music. I feel a little better. ^_^
This track is so relaxing.
I can actually focus on writing code with this music... this is unacceptable!
I'm just sliding out of this chair.
Kammerjunk Yup.
I usually listen to Too Long when I'm mining, though.
What time would it be where Vi is anyway?
I'd love to see the tracklist somewhere on the site
Now there's a good Daft Punk number.
16:51, FairysHuff
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-new-fluttershy-in-a-nutshell.png
derpy_pony Ah just 1 hour ahead of me then
Consarnit, Vivi, you're reminding me how tired I am.
FairysHuff: UK?
Kammerjunk Yes
Right-o.
If it wasn't for this liquid energy sitting next to me, I'd be asleep...
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-as-celestia-is-my-witness.png
PonyNegZero Huh?
I think I read a fanfic or three centered around this Spike growing up thing once.
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-cut-in-line-ill-take-whats-mine1.png
Heya everypony!
FairysHuff: there is a can of magic sitting next to me...
hi EggWhite|TERA
owaw, apparently Bear Grylls follows tennis.
PonyNegZero Aaah. That never helps me ^_^
this is good music to eat breakfast to :)
Heya EggWhite|TERA :)
woot Roger Federer
FairysHuff: believe me, I'm already tired... I have hours of work still, a big dinner, and then a ranked TF2 match tonight...
EggWhite|TERA: TERA - Now there's an interesting game I never got into.
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-silly-person.jpg
>2012
>Trolling bronies
PonyNegZero Maybe you should switch to the Espresso's.
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-portal-pie.jpg
PonyNegZero: You know what you need? A Dolce Gusto machine.
FairysHuff: well, they took the keurig machine to the training room...
Dolce Gusto machines make such good coffees.
PonyNegZero Once again - Huh? ^_^
Bronysith: does naht compute
FairysHuff: I know... I hope this isn't a weeklong training thing again...
Kammerjunk: Tis a fun game, a bit too easy to level up on but the combat is good
I concur,.
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-that-awesome-moment.png
/me Sudden power slide into the alley of different topics.
Kammerjunk: ever tried italian coffe?
MadSurge: What, like cappucino?
Anyone have any recommendations of Android Apps?
PonyNegZero: Actually, I have an idea. You know those energy drinks you can get in shot size?
Take 8.
just think of something, there's an app for that
Kammerjunk: my job doesn't provide those...
Kammerjunk And then he can watch his heart explode
Kammerjunk: yep, the kind that fits in a small cup but is really concentrated
PonyNegZero: Neither did my school. Didn't stop my from rocking in my chair all day.
FairysHuff: explode twice
MadSurge: Oh yeah, I know those. My dad drinks them every morning before work. I'm not in such a rush, though.
Kammerjunk: I do have this starbucks refresher thing...
I don't really like energy drinks, it's like drinking bubblegum :s
Brb everypony I'm going to try something on my PC and it may disconnect my IRC
Actually, in retrospect, 8 energy drink shots was probably a bad idea.
I like Hazelnut Lattes myself. Don't have them often though. Makes my heart tremble.
I just derailed the whole conversation... score 1 for me
In the I-can't-sit-still-right-now-for-god's-sake-help kind of way.
I've been in Starbucks in Madrid, but all I bought was chocolate muffins :D
Kammerjunk: for-celestia's-sake
Hello everyzebra
lol MadSurge
I visited the first starbucks in Seattle
FairysHuff: I have a nice cup of mocha at least once a day. Had 3 today to keep me awake.
Anyone else still pissed off at their parents answer to everything as a child being "Cause I said so"
Hello mitamaking :)
FairysHuff: I never did get over that
FairysHuff, No
FairysHuff: :[
mitamaking Jim Your lucky then.
Right now I'm questoning if doing the Radio Tower Team Rocket segment with a level 48 typhloshion is overkill
I got that evertime I asked something.
MegaMoonShine: mind you, I've been there more than 3 years ago :D so no ponies involved, just chocolate craving :D
FairysHuff: Nope. My parents didn't do that. Instead, my dad tried to explain it to me in baby words, and I always ended up misunderstanding it.
Wait I said I was and Jim said he didn't
hi everyone :3
Kammerjunk Well at least your parents tried.
hi Hrafn
Hrafn: Salve!
New Trixie vs. and The Wotch this morning, yay
hi Hrafn :)
Maybe I should buy a coffee machine to make myself HazelNut lattes.
FairysHuff: Yeah, good intentions and everything, but one particular episode made me terrified of the washing machine because I thought the little holes could suck my skin through them.
o_o
Kammerjunk hehe thats cute ^_^
No, it was terrifying D:
FairysHuff: Also, yeah, you should totally get a Dolce Gusto machine. It also makes chococcinos!
And really bad tea.
FairysHuff: Oh, childhood imagination.
You so silly.
FairysHuff: did you zoidberg woop woop woop across it?
FairysHuff: Awwww :)
PonyNegZero No. I just closed my eyes and ran as hard as I could till I reached the otherside ^_^
FairysHuff: don't trip~
cupcakes
I'm just going to go downstairs, for I fear I'll burst from all this caffeine.
...wait, what song is this?
Kammerjunk: lucky me, my parents always treated me like a thinking being and tried to explain me everything without too much babytalk
God, this music!
It's so chill...
PonyNegZero I obviously don't do it anymore. ^_^ Though a bully did almost throw me off that bridge once as a child. I would have died had he succeeded.
dat music
FairysHuff: Don't die, dying is bad
FairysHuff: and he would be in a madhouse
FairysHuff: a bully almost choked me to death once. thankfully i had a friend with me and i was able to tell him to call our parents who were close
FairysHuff: i think i was like 7-8 at the time
*Nods* I hate bullies with a passion.
sprinkle_GS17 - that's not bullying, that's assault
why can't schools recognize the difference?
THAT'S the real problem with bullying
bullies are horrible ._.
MirrorImage: well its probably my english, not my native language. he wasnt a school bully, he was some teen on a playground
and that is why I was taught some self defence in TKD...
Testing testing 1 2 3
If I could go back in time and re-live my life, I'd start by breaking the limbs of every bully I come across
and yeah, I agree, a lot of things that kids do to other kids tends to be written off as "bullying", but if an adult were to do the same thing, it would be a serious crime
Well being bullied almost most of your school life really takes a toll on you
same
wasn't saying you used the wrong word - i meant society has been using the wrong word
Ok all is good...Ignore me
"Oh, they're just kids in school. He's a big bully"
versus "Oh, he just tried to kill that kid"
killerpony7733 I've been there.
Alright, so I was obviously not jacked enough, so I made another cup of coffee.
makes you.......a little..........CrAZy........
Kammerjunk - cup? make the whole pot
Kammerjunk: you wouldn't believe what I'd do for a chai latte right now...
MirrorImage: Oh no, doesn't work like that. I pop in capsules and it makes me a cup.
I know someone who was bullied as a child. Now he's 50-something years and is the nicest person I know
FairysHuff: So have i, I still very much carry the scar's of it
PonyNegZero: I think I have a few capsules with that. Not really my cup of tea.
you talking those Keurig things?
You see what I did there.
yayayay
Kammerjunk: well, if I had a keurig machine... -glares down hallway...-
killerpony7733 As do I. *Cuddles* ~_~ It's not something you just get over.
i has new songy
and here's the best part of working where i do...
these songs man make u think
free coffee and soda all day long
course, i ignore the coffee and go straight for the Pepsi Max
free is my favourite flavour :3
yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
So far in school I have yet to be bullied, but that is probably because I completly withdraw myself from anyone in school, there is only one person I will talk to there, I refuse to talk to anyone else.
Good morning everypony! :)
hai RaveBrony
i made u a pie
Morning, RaveBrony
MirrorImage: same for me, but it also includes red bulls, BOTTLES or root beer, and other stuff
Yellop RaveBrony
hmmm... we don't get red bull
I had a few bullies in school, but I also had close friends
Best part of working here, free breakfast, lunch, dinner
EggWhite: I used to be bullied. Then I just kinda stopped caring, and bullying halted in its wake.
soup
EggWhite I tried that in HighSchool. Still got bullied badly
/me waves to Jim, AttacktheAndalite, and EggWhite! :)
but my coworker keeps a 12-pack in his overdesk shelf at any given point
Who is streaming? :o
if i was feeling desperate for one, i'd know exactly where to find them
Okay, so should I buy a wireless headset so I can listen to music while making tea, or should I just spend money on actually BUYING Skyrim and then having extra dosh for Steam Summer Sale?
I gave 0 bucks in high school... I made myself such a target and just brushed off everything
well shit
Tranq is rebooting
PonyNegZero: That's kind of what I do. The way I see it, if I'm able to make fun of myself for my own shortcomings, why should I care if others do so?
Something to note, bullying doesnt end once you leave school. >_>
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-my-faith-in-humanity-not-pretty.png
Kammerjunk - and that's the perfect reason why Bronies are so "meh" about trolls
my high school life would've been so much better if i had become a brony 8 years ago
FairysHuff: Please punch me in the gut if I'm using this incorrectly, but man's inhumanity to man.
Actually, bullying kind of stopped at my end when I left high school
MirrorImage, With G3,6? yeah, good luck with that
im go to love and tolorate the buck out of u
Jim - the modern definition of "brony" i mean
8 years ago, i was still rolling my eyes at MLP toys
^
Kammerjunk I have no idea if thats right or not. Doesn't sound wrong though.
^
Howdy y'all!
Hi Everlasting_Joy
hi there
Howdy Everlasting_Joy :)
FairysHuff - punch him anyways
Hi Evarlasting_Joy!
MirrorImage I'll let you do it.
I don't think people would find my much of a target, I don't ever change my facial expression, I never say anything and if someone attempts to bully me all they get is an emotionless stare, that and the only person I do talk to is about 6' 7" and not many people are willing to mess with him.
/me cracks knuckles and glares menancingling
Hey Jim, Hrafn, MegaMoonShine, and Flyboy!
True story, I watched some G1 out of boredom when I was 7-8, didn't think it was that bad o__o
MadSurge: Nothing wrong with that.
OMG NO FUCKING WAY http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-cranky-captain-ginyu.jpg
oooh, that made me think of something. A few years back, I was at a friends house. His little sister had a huuge collection of MLP toys and figurines. I thought it was the worst waste of money ever
MadSurge - i think that's half the reason a not-insignificant number of us "liked" Sailor Moon back in the 90s
Nowadays I'd be ALL over that
MirrorImage: but I DID like Sailor Moon :D
as did i
but REALLY think about it
I liked watching G1 with my cousin when I was little :P
but I doubt I'd enjoy it today
I'll be right back.
Never cared about "girly" labels, the sailors kicked some serious ass :D
G1 is not bad at all actually
The only thing "girly" that I really liked was the Powerpuff Girls when I was a kid
Jim: g1 wasnt that bad, but then there was g3 'shiver'
Jim: I was spending a week out of town because silly pipe leaks, and I used the room of the 8-ish daughter of my mum's friend. She had an MLP toy.
Am I the only one that didn't have a tv when they were a kid and would run to a friends house just to watch baby looney tunes?
...It was Nightmare Fuel Pinkie Pie.
MadSurge - "Do you beliee-ve in the power of love?"
Jim: only g3 was unsavageable :D
Indeed it was ^
I might give G1 another chance sometime
I love baby looney tunes!
SO CUTE
I've still yet to watch Sailor Moon, I mean I have watched atleast 700 hours of anime, yet not a single episode of Sailor Moon...I'll get round to it one day
G1 was supposed to be wuite good. atleast it had a sense of adventure in it.
MirrorImage: In the name of the moon, I will punish you! :D
G1-G2, from what I've heard, it's okay. Now G3, that's the one you should worry about lol
hiya everypony :)
I'm back.
Everlasting_Joy: hey man
Seriously, nightmare fuel Pinkie Pie is terrifying.
what little I've seen of G3 has given me permanent brain damage
the doctor is in
maaaan I hate Disney
Howdy Bronysith!
Why they have to be stupid now
doc-tor... THE DOC-TOR?!
I hate disney too Insane
EXTERMINATE!
Insane: Disney was pretty cool when they made good films.
/me waves a plunger around
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GOOD SHOWS?
MAAAAN
Insane: Ikr

NOW I MISS EVERY SINGLE SHOW FROM MY CHILD HOOD
inb4 "Dammit Jim, I'm a doctor not a x"
Insane: Coproration, my freind
Hrafn: I've seen Newborn Cuties, my psyche is still intact but I'm still nauseated :D
Corperation*
oh god, I saw an episode of that :P
/me hugs Insane "I know that feel bro"
Insane - i know, where's someone who can stream us some raw nostalgia?
I still suffer from post traumatic stress disorder
Madsurge: i didnt even dare to watgh it
R.i.p best days ever
What?
Insane: they're coming back, in new franchises!
:D
Flyboy: I can take insanity OuO
i whent on a phycotic killing spree
Duck Tales was probably the most memorable from my childhood
"What happened to the good shows?"? It really depends on what your taste is. I found some shows passable, but didn't watch. MLP:FiM was the first that I loved
MadSurge: then you sir, are a god
The show has gained a COLT following
Jim - Woo oo
Yay netsplits?
Flyboy: no, just insane to begin with :D
dat jammerKunk
Or no, probably just my Internet being silly.
Legend of Korra was the 2nd :P

Madsurge: "Youve got a lot of spunk, i like that in a man." Honeydew Inc, 2012

Flyboy: Aye. Weird is in the eye of the viewer.
eye of the beholder *
It all depends what you define is weird
Theres thousands of soccer moms in my neighbor hood!

FairysHuff: Probably. Figured I'd just play it safe.
Insane Kill them all.

FairysHuff: That's nothing. MW3 is still €60.
Heart
Kammerjunk Thats not a surprise. People are stupid and keep buying that crap
games are cheaper in amarica
It's still retarded, though.
The shows kids watch these days
yes, which is why Modern Warfare 2 was still $55 as Black Ops was being released...
There's nothing on!
Insane - that's cause they don' thave the Hub
