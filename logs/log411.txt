I just got a new battery for my own laptop today
now it will not die in less than 10 minutes
1212like the 3DS?
/me runs
Eenope.
yea
then again I tried that too in Walmart
1212For that reason I had to buy a car charger for my 3DS
by cranking the 3D slider only half way up I did not get a headache!
Shouldnt you be doing something with TGaPT?
nor disorientation
wut ?
1212nice
1212I got used to it so now I almost always have it on full blast :x
The Great and Powerful Trixie of course
/me bonks RX-78-2-SweetieBot upside the head.
:P
I did at one point
I got dizzy and disoriented
1212ah
but then again this was with the 3D slider cranked all the way up
03yeah, I have to have the 3D *off*
halfway to about three quarters of the way up is fine
03so it's basically a waste of a console
13Aren't you supposed to use the slider so that you can let your eyes slowly adjust to it over time anyway?
1212drf, the 3DS isn't only about 3D :P
1212and yeah AE
don't know and to be honest don't care
1212that would be like saying the wii is only about that remote derp
03you mean it's not?
1212drf
1212http://images.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/10576698.jpg
03the Wii is essentially a GameCube with wireless remotes...
1212XD
sure seems that way
1212well, everything Nintendo makes is really about the content
not really
more about the gimmicks
03^
1212That’s an opinion
1212:P
its not an opinion
its the truth
they have been all about gimmicks since the release of the DS
12[16:42] well, everything Nintendo makes is really about the content
12So you’re saying they have all that exclusive content like Zelda and Mario for no reason?
pretty much
03Since the release of the DS
03Originally they were good
03but since maybe 2007
03they've kinda sucked
Sony and Microsoft have exclusive stuff too
1212people don't really buy those just for the content though
where r LL
mostly because the systems are true innovation
1212Nintendo would go under if they didn't have good content.
03why
12That's the ONLY reason anyone bothers playing Nintendo's stuff
because their systems suck
the Wii was outdated as soon as it was released
same with the
Gameboy Color
1212drf, Halo doesn't have as many fans as say Mario Pokemon and Zelda
03orly?
03go join some Halo 3 matches on Xbox Live, I dare you
/me hides
04lolhalo3
04Play Reach n00bs
/me runs
03same idea.
in the time it took Nintendo to come out with a full color portable they had already been beaten by Atari, Sega, and NEC
03LOL NEC
poor meanwhile, soon he will truly embrace his feelings
Shaddup you.
in their case its true
NEC came out with the Turbo Express aka the PC Engine Game Tank
1212see, Nintendo has same of the best selling franchises of all time.
12Mario has sold more than 220 million units before, and Pokmon 210 million
03key word on franchise
03I'm pretty certain that Halo 2 holds the record for fastest selling out of a game
03LOL
03or most preorders, something like that
03I know Pokémon Yellow has a similar record but yeah
1212no, Pokemon Black and White had the most pre-orders
1212nope, all games
03according to who
1212just google "black white preorders" :P
03oh it was Halo 3
03GameSpot reported 4.2 million units of Halo 3 were in retail outlets on September 24, 2007, a day before official releasea world record volume.[142][143] Halo 3 broke the previous record for the highest grossing opening day in entertainment history, making US$170 million in its first twenty-four hours.
1212that's 2007 drf LOL
03dude that's only comparing to other games released around the same time
03not every game ever made
03learn to do better research
03I'm referring to the Guinness Book of World Records so don't question me
1212Guinness Book of World Records from 2007? derp
/me runs
03no
03from like 2010 or something
03I can check the newest one
03but I'm lazy
03I don't think ti was preorders, I think it was opening day sales
03but regardless
03those are still only recent games
03from 2011

1212there
03hey look, #1 isn't BW, your argument is invalid
/me runs
1212derp
1212I said it had the most pre-orders, not sales XD
03and I said you're an idiot
03problem?
1212but as you can see, most of the top games on that page are Nintendo
03read the bottom
03Just like PG-13 movies inherently make more money than R-rated moviesbecause they are accessible to a much wider audiencegames that appeal to a wide age range always outsell even the most successful mature titles. Thus, until Master Chief starts tangling with Pikachu, Halo 3 will carry much more marketing heft than it does sales clout.
1212It’s the only reason Nintendo still exist
1212well, I never said why those get so many sales derp

1212another reason E-T games get more sales is because they also appeal to a lot of people who buy M games
1212XD
1212but really, I don’t think anyone buys a wii because they think it has better graphics than everyone else
03that's the point LOL
1212the 3DS did for a few weeks (Compared to portables) , but that was very short lived
03Not...really
03the PSP has better graphics than the 3DS

1212well yeah
03:P
03it's not so much the hardware but what you do with it.
lolwut
1212PSP has a better resolution
03Nintendo has always made crap-horrible hardware and then programmed accordingly, making the best of their hardware
03hence the whole "Genesis does what Nintendon't" thing
03it was true, too
03GameCube supposedly had better graphics than PS2, but did they actually use it? Nope.
03Wii is essentially GameCube hardware with wireless, so...
1212and widescreen
1212Native widescreen
03there's no such thing as native widescreen
1212they were both 480p
03it's called anamorphic
03and it's no different
03:P
03"native widescreen" is essentially 720 and 1080p
03480 doesn't have it
03it's still 720x480

12ohai
admittedly, I've yet to see one good reason for the GTA series
6so while M games might not be to blame
02GTA can be fun
6that game is stupid and pointless really.
02but I fell off a tree nd died once
12GTA?
02Grand Theft Auto
6oh yeah, lets break every law possible since we can't do that irl
12ah
12EW Grand Theft Auto
02I have't played it in a couple of years
02and it was always someone else's copy
12Need for speed is much more fun and you're not killing anyone
!touhou
I, am a 7Shizuha Aki.
02Midtown Madness 3 is fun
^who dis
6it's a typical racing game
12yep
6GTA is just a crap pile really
unfortunately, MM3 is only xbox :\
02yep
12indeed
02my dad only has an Xbox
02I have an Xbox 360 though
12However, as much as I don’t like most M games, I don’t think they’re to blame for most crimes
12someone's not going to kill someone because they were playing a game
03I said this last night
03it's more the fact that those games desensitize people
03than actually cause them to do things
03if you see a crime you might just be like "eh" and walk away
12yeah
12some kills someone. They find out they had a M game. >:@@@@@@ THAT'S WHY
12someone*
Yeah.. There's been more people coming on ever since the new mods came on~
12but like every other person has a M game of some kind XD
Don't know why though~
12So of coarse some of those people are going to have a M game
we seem to have retained a lot from this past weekend for some reason
03there's a difference between *having* a M-rated game and playing it on a regular basis
12true
OLd Man DRF and his M rated games
rather, which is wierd considering there wasnt an episode
12I dislike almost all M games
03I honestly think most T-rated games are more fun, just because the M-rated ones tend to be solely BASED ON blood and gore and not actual storyline
03stuff like Left 4 Dead is fun until you overplay it
03and get tired of it
03:/
12T games tend to be my favs
That might kinda of be why, they showed up for the episode, but since there wasnt a new one, they stayed a bit and liked the weirdness of the streams or something
12and E +10
1212Because most games have a E+10 rating XD

What is in that box ?
:p
03I usually keep it in my car, since it has all sorts of different screwdriver heads

> Finding SNES screwdrivers
So difficult :|
02O.o
03I got one, umad?
03it was like $10
03on eBayu
03-u
10Ain't even mad bro
03I have both a NES/SNES and a GB game one
03both are reverse-torx bits
02SNES screwdrivers?
03the NES/SNES one is bigger
03yerah
03-r
03it's the reverse of a torx (star-shaped) screw
03where there's a star in the middle with a circle around it
02You need specific screwdrivers to take apart the consoles?
Yeah
02makes sense I guess
well
Only if you're Nintendo :D
02heh
03correction
03Only if you're Nintendo or Chinese
/me runs
03because guess who made imitation screwdrivers quickly and started selling them :P
/me has a mental image of herself taking apart an Xbox. O.o
03I've taken apart an Xbox.
03It broke, too
03but not because of me >_>
02was it fun?
03yeah
I took apart one as well
03until the stupid thing broke XD
O-o
Hm
02D:
but because it was non functional
03my friend still owes me a replacement
03>_>
LOL
03he sent me a hacked Xbox that had about 2 days worth of life lefty
03-y
02ugh
03I plug it in, play about a day and it red rings
02idiot
03I was like WTF?
03I send it back
03he's like "oh yeah, it's fried"
03I was like ... dude... you should have checked it first
If Nintendo's carts were Unibody
That would be raegtasic
02I've never had an Xbox red ring before
03well
Me neither
03I sorta got scammed on eBay :/
BEcause I've never owned one.
:D
03like
03I wanted an Xbox hacked for me
02I guess that's a good thing
03so my frined was like
03*friend
03"Send me one and I'll hack it"
03well I only have one
02my dad's Xbox is hacked
03didn't want to mess with that one
02it's always orange-ringed
03so I went on eBay, found a used Xbox 360 for around $80
03had it sent to him
03turns out the reason the guy was selling it
03is because he attempted to hack it himself and BROKE the thing
03and was like "Uh, whoops"
03>_>
02ugh
03but by that time I had already left positive feedback so nothign I can do
03w/e
03my friend still owes me an Xbox LOL'
02:/
03he's literally got about 12 of them
02O.o
0312 *entire* ones, plus parts of others
03he hacks consoles for a hobby
02that's crazy
03of all types
02oh
03Xbox, PS3, a few Wiis
03though he hates Wii
02well that explains it
03and would prefer not to XD
03yeah
02Wii is childish. >.<
03I'm gonna ask him to help me hack my PS3 sometime
Wii ftw :|
I will agree
butthurt wii haters can't take the awesome hackability

03it has good ideas behind it but Nintendo, like usual, doesn't do much to use that potential
03hence why the homebrew is better tha most games

02tLoS DoD is annoying on the Wii
02not that I've played it on anything else
tlos dod?
the legend of suck dawn of disaster?
:p
I don't catch the acronym
and LOL HML
A lot of Wii games do suck
Same with the new Spyro :c
03oh hey this is a good deal
>Xenoblade Chronicles
03for Linkin Park's new album coming out in June
enough for me
03Remixes? OK
03Though ew paying $16 for a DIGITAL DOWNLOAD
03the actual disc is $10
03*20
03I'd do that, but I don't know what my address will be in June :/
02tLoS killed Spyro
02but not as badly as Skylanders
/me shudders
ohno
03Skylanders is a retarded concept.
6I loved TLoS lol...
03Ironically, LL actually thought it was a good idea
03I was like "u srs?"
6skylanders /seems/ cool
03>Making you buy cheap plastic figurines to play a game
03>no thank you
02yeah
6until you realize it's more spending money than pokemon cards were
03it's what most people call "physical DRM"
02and Spyro LOOKS LIKE A FREAKING PUG
03As if REGULAR DRM is bad enough
6yeah I wasn't happy with the art team for that game
03OK I don't know who the frick Spyro is and what the fuss is, I'm commenting on the fact that you have to buy stupid figurines to play the game
02BREATHING PROBLEMS ANYONE
03I don't actually play most game series, I just follow the stupid copy protection methods companies are using
03it's part of WHY I Don't play most games :P
02The original PS1 Spyro games were the best
03though I did laugh quite a bit when Ubisoft ragequit the PC gaming industry
02they did?
03"Fine, you guys keep complaining about our DRM? Instead of doing the sensible thing and FIXING it, we're just going to stop"
03Yep.
03they made some press statement about how PC gaming is "too much of a hassle" and how they were only going to deal with consoles from now on
02so no more Assassin's Creed games on the PC?
03it's because the entire world basically HATED their DRM
03apparently not.
02D:
03I don't follow their stuff, again, I just know about the stupid crap they pull
Not a loss
LOL
02I prefer PC controls
03when I play games on the PC, I use a wired Xbox 360 controller. LOL
<Aurora> yeah I wasn't happy with the art team for that game<---I'm not a Spyro fan, but yes, my god yes
I'm not really that judgemental in terms of art design but I HATED skylanders
03am I the only one who hates the game because it requires you to buy collectible stuff in order to play it, having nothing to do with the art or lack thereof?
02I finished Portal 2 on the PC, then months later I played co-op briefly on the Xbox
02the controls were too sensitive
04>Spyro Skylands
if the game was good I wouldn't care, but I don't plan on playing it anytime soon
03I played the Portal 2 co-op on the PC and then the single-player on Xbox 360 and later played the co-op again with LL on Xbox 360
04At least it unifies TLoS/Old Gen fans
04Skylanders*
04GODDAMNIT
so for all I know it might be, but that art design .___.
03has anybody pirated it yet? :D
03inb4 make your own figurines
02I don't plan to play Skylanders EVER
03^
02heh
Never
Ever
03I've never played a single Spyro game
03and have no idea what the fuss is about
03but again
03>PHYSICAL DRM
/me vomits
Sticking with the PS1 games and/or a random PS2 one
BRICK DRAGON! ACTIVATE!
LOL
:D
I have hunger.
03really, *any* DRM is awful
brb
03inb4 people misspelling my initials for DRM >_>
DRF, the worst DRM
03LOL.
Is when you gotta have a disk in the drive
:D
03the only acceptable DRM is that which can be easily removed
02I've got tLoS tEN on my DS and I hate it
03like iTunes
03I can just strip the DRM right off
"Please insert the disk into the drive so you can play"
03as long as the Requiem project doesn't die off
02because I can't beat Terrador
But, I'm on a laptop
03HML
02CURSE YOU EARTH ELDER DRAGON
03you ever played the original Backyard Baseball?
03That thing was the most legit game ever
Nope
03No isntalling
:<
03You just pop the CD in
03and it starts
03:D
02sounds good
02but
02baseball?
03I hate most sports games, but that game was awesome
03it's actually really fun
03trust me XD
02O.o
03there's a backyard soccer too but I hated that
02o...k?
03mainly because soccer is too chaotic
02eh
03baseball, at least you're only playing one person at a time
03at least when you're at bat
03and not trying to control an entire team
02I like soccer irl
03they later made like, a Backyard Basketball and some other spinoffs
03but the original was the best by far
02but sports games on consoles? forget it.
03There's a Backyard Baseball 2003, I didn't like it
03not console
02k
03Backyard Baseball is a series of children's games for the Game Boy Advance, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Wii, iOS, and the PC. It is the original game in the Backyard Sports series. Currently all the games in the series have been developed by Humongous Entertainment and published by Atari. It is one of six Backyard Sports games.
03really?
03GBA, PS2, even iOS?
02Is there an appropriate umbrella term I can use?
03Pssh, I only have it for PC
03http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backyard_Baseball
03the 1997 one is the one I'm referring to
03back when I had Windows 95
03that game was awesome
02stupid thing automatically opens links in IE
02I'm using Chrome, dammit
03it opens in whatever your default browser is.
02:I
02I should change that
02IE sucks
03so HML
03I actually sorta want a Chromebook
03Just for lulz
Haha
Well,
03but they're a bit expensive for what they're worth
ChromeOS/Chromium OS
03do they have CHrome OS as an installable ISO I can play with in a VM?
Runs on a regular laptop
;D
uh
Bad idea
03why
I tried the VM version
and
No support
for anything
03ethernet doesn't work I'm guessing?
like, mouse + drivers
03wtf?
Not exactly
hey guys, how can i msg from irc client into #bronystate?
03did you use VMWare or VBox

that will be done later
or i could include #bronystate
that would be pointless
it evens out the grid and doesnt include this room
thats basically giving the mods their own space during the recording
03TigerDirect.com
03Hit LIKE if you ? Sony!
03How about no
03that ? is a heart
somethings gota be in that space
might as well be the mods

...Howabout a FAKE regulars room :3333
03my sister just gave up on trying to get the mouse to work
real problem is the irc client will most likely be kicked with sendq exceeded
03I should have just had her get a USB moise.
03*mouse
03as much as laptops usually don't have many USB ports and it takes up one, at least it WORKS
03:/
or excess flood, either way it'll pull too much from the irc server
Yay for 4 USb ports?
03hers has 3
03and one of them is a 3.0
03mine also has 3, one of which is a hybrid eSATA
03but I've actually used all 3 at once before
Lucky USB#
I have once
As
Whats this recording for? the new ep?
I turned my laptop into a PC
> USB keyboard, mouse, external HDD and wireless game controller
:D
i turned my PS3 into laptop

03hey, you're the one who brought it up

10when I saw "BURN IT DOWN"
right?
10not recognizing the title
each client is a connection
10I thought, wait wat
03also wait what, if you're on your PC, why not just connect the iPod to the PC...
lemme try
03to rename it
02Oh, and I learned how to use a bass guitar amplifier, mixing table and DJ decks last night.

10I am on laptop
I thought it was multi pop-outs

or...
10I didn't get iTunes on my laptop
multiple windows
not sure...

it's brainf
03that
it's worse than bf though
since bf has 8 operatives
this only has 3

03I think vSphere is FINALLY ALMOST STARTED
o-o
lmao
03it takes like
03hours
just wait another few hours
03but supposedly only at first run
03yeah
03basically what I'm doing
03I installed Windows 7 natively (Why 7? because I'm too lazy to mess with server), + drivers, and then did the experience index benchmark
03then I'm gonna install 7 inside the VM
03give it the full CPU/RAM
03and benchmark again
03see how it compares
03if it's close enough
03I'll run it on my server
03and you can have Linux via that
03good? :P

cool

03I can get 3GB for Windows
03and if it takes like 512MB or so for vsphere
03you're fine with the rest? :P
it'll probably eat like 512mb or something
sure
03OK
if you can, it'd be nice to get 2 extra IPs, I'll pay for them
03yeah if I get it to work I can just give you the vsphere admin pasword
don't think 2 IPs needs justification
03we'll deal with that later XD
Yeah lmao
03since I'm gonna need the LARA console again
03at elast
03*least
03they left that flash drive plugged in
and then i'll add your server to a botnet and then I'll be happy

03ISOLINUX
03to load
03so I can easily just use unetbootin
they left it plugged in?
03yep.
03same with the USB floppy drive
/me facepalms
03that has drivers
03THE WRONG DRIVERS TOO MIGHT I AD
>floppy
03*ADD
what
03you know how Windows wasn't seeing the hard drives?
yeah
03due to the RAID controller?
03yeah
yeah I saw
03they're like
03"We connected them"
lmao
03they put a USB floppy drive
03it had the WRONG F'ING DRIVERS
FLOPPY
03so I had to go find them mysel
03f
/me snaps the floppy and flops it around
03then use the Linux recovery console
03to put them on the USB
03meanwhile PAYING FOR THE GOD DANG LARA CONSOLE
03I'm a bit mad still
03but whatever
._.
03FMA says that VSphere is based on Linux (I don't doubt it) so
still, hetzner's uptime is quite awesome
uhh my head -_-
probably is
03it SHOULD "just work" with the RAID controller?
03and not neeed drivers?
03-e
a lot of things like that are based off linux or unix
should
linux generally works
or doesn't
03XD
new trick backfire?
other http://www.linux-drivers.org/
otherwise
03I've had more experience with it not workin
03g
if it doesn't have it installed already
derp
03uh
03search for 3ware? I'm lazy
/me runs
more like i think i'm getting sick
lmao
That sounds much worse
you should get some juice and crackers and rest then, instead of being on a computer
03oh my god
03I thought I'd reboot it to see if it went any faster
03Nope.
03Not at all.
03give me like 2 more hours to test >_>
i did fell asleep a few hours ago, so now i can't sleep -_-
._.
03I guess that's the one downside to vSphere
it shouldn't be taking that long to boot
03is stupidly long reboot times
03I learned that from work
ah
03when I accidentally unplugged it
03it took like half an hour to come back online

Want me to play it in Chrome? </troll><
ah
03the whole idea to vSphere
then watch some ponies :3
03is that you leave the physical machine running
03and just reboot the VMs as needed
03so yeah
ah
03but when I bumped the power cord
03and had to restart it
03my GOD LOL
03so we just gotta hope Hetzner doesn't lose power

lmao
tis' a dedi
pretty sure they run their own generators
03can we hire some random troll to go cut the power and find out?

lmao
thnx Late
Redundant

My story is too much for me to explain atm.
My life is just F**KING PEACHY atm.
04Well, explain it when you can.
okaaayyyy
JUST BLOODY DIDDILY DANDY.
04And maybe we can help comfort you.
6um
6if a girl is causing you to be this rage-y
6no offense man
6but that's not healthy
i might just write a document in note pad, dropbox it and link it in here.
Sure
02I swear I didn't do it
Do that please
:s
actually
04Shiny
screw posting it in here
04how dare you cause this
ill PM it to a select few of you.
04rightio
6dude you need to
Okay :c
028C
6relax
6a bit
6stress literally isn't healthy, and drives people /away/
I'm trying.
well its driven my gf away...again
6what did you do?
apparently i was taking a little joke "too far". when i was clearly just playing around.
i didnt know any better.
she didnt tell me to stop.
6in which case it's not your fault
6well
6more like both your faults
yeah.
thats how i saw it
6but one thing that relationships seem to dwell on a lot is what's "offensive"
6relationships, you're supposed to be best friends, so when you're mad, you're not supposed to leave and ragequit basically
and that offensive list is massive with her i think
6you should be able to handle it maturely and decide what went wrong
i can barely go a day w/o being in tears.
EVEN ON THE DAY OF MY SHOWS I CANT GO W/O CRYING.
04"You're and @$$" may be totally acceptable, but on the other hand "I don't like those shoes" may turn her into an eldritch horror.
she throws a fit for that too.
6um
;-;
6wait how old are you?
18 why?
-.-
`-`
6just wondering
sigh.
anyway. im like
6cuz you're making it sound like you're not getting anyhting positive out of the relation.
atm im not
6a girl who makes you cry no matter what, yeah
6I see people root themselves into relationships and they suffer for it, I don't know why they stay
6so as long as you find something to hold onto
6it's worth it if you deem it worthy
6but you need to measure that against how miserable you are in the bad times
6"partners are there to drag you out of the bad times" can only go so far.
04A small high isn't worth abysmal downtimes.
04Why am I giving relationship advice when I've never had a girlfriend
/me shuts up now.
6lol
02Relationship in a friend way possibly?
well i'm not in a PROPER relationshop
...
relationship*
o-o
6I wouldn't really be considered "experienced" in this, and yet people always seem to come to me for it, so I tend to be fairly good at it
I'm in a LD ne.
one*
6if it's not a proper relationship
04Aurora, so do all my IRL friends to me.
04It's weird.
6you really shouldn't value it so highly
6unless you can see yourself marrying said person
6think it through before causing more grief
02I'm that general advice person too.
04I think TST is made of general advice people.
SIGH
/me doodles on the back of Roara's head
6it's not always the best
/me doodles on the back of Shiny's head.
6but I do advise you take a look at where you are right now
12Shiny~
6and decide what's worth it and what's not.
6if you are depressed that often...
02Hey LL
02Sorry I can't stay and draw on anyone else's heads, but I have to sleep
6night
ow my ribs are hurting alot ;_;
04Night Shiny
/me hugs
i know Drake.
12Nick alert
12XD
/me removes Night from nick alert
12[21:43] <Drake> I think TST is made of general advice people. <-- Best thing ever said
I can't....let...her...go... ;_;
I've been with her for over a year ;_;
6um
.,.
6that right there is the most dangerous and destructive thing I've heard a person say
i know ;_;
If i did let her go...well...she'd kill herself ;_;
6are you willing to stay with a person who makes you cry on a daily basis, who clearly doesn't understand your humor, all because you'e been with her for only a year?
6..
she nearly attempted it.
04...
04I have no words.
6then have a psychologist when you do it
6again, you are rooting yourself to something that is not your responsibility
12wait
what can i do
12what did I miss?
i dont want to ruin her trust ;_;
6are you content marrying her?
6or worse, having her think she'll marry you and then you say no?
12O_O
12O_o*
6SS, does her parents know she's semi-suicidal?
12did you meet her online or IRL?
no matter what, you should do what you think in your heart should do...in other words, what you truly feel will make you happy
bwaaaaaaa
online GL. and yes Roara.
6then let them know
actually wait
12ah
6if anything, talk to them first
6as awkward as that sounds
i misread that as my parents
no her mom doesnt.
and she hates her mom.
6dad?
12why does she make you cry?
her dad is in cali.
she lives in WA
i dont even know her dad.
6ok well
GL: long story.
6that makes it somewhat harder
6but the fact remains that you're basically chained to a person and you don't seem to have a say in anything
^pretty much
04^Seconded
if you took all the worry of what she will do out of the equation
6as I've had to say to several people (believe me, the suicidal thing isn't the first time I've heard it), whatever happens to the other person IS NOT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY
12v downed
is she really worth the effort? think about that long and hard
/me runs
6I hate being this blunt, but if she were to injure herself, that's not something you should be responsible for and so you should not worry about it
sigh
this is too overwhelming atm ;-;
6I mean, feel sad yes, but not because it was your fault
6I'm only trying to help
6because you've mentioned this trouble before
04:/
12and why does he want to leave her?
i dont want to leave her.
if i did she'd kill herself GL.
sigh
12then why are you upset? derp
i know you guys are trying to help and many thanks for it ;_; but im just really overwhelmed on what to do atm.
6allow yourself to remain in a suffering position, or free yourself and perhaps it wont be as bad as you think
READ UP DUDE IM TIRED OF EXPLAING IT.
6there's your two choices
o-o
/me lazy
dude...
04And stop yelling at people trying to help.
6drake
i was yelling at GL.
6that was NS's fault
6not SS's
04Ok
12so I'm the bad guy? lmao
NS, that was very insensitive of you to say that
:|
that aside
6I think it's been pointed out to you several times, you don't really think
SS, it's important to collect your nerves and work through things one step at a time
12I think :|
6yeah
6when you see a conversation going
6try reading first
6repeating oneself is rather annoying, especially when something like this is being discussed
12like I said, lazy :'D
04...
6then no sh*t, get out of the conversation
/me sighs
6it's one thing to be in a conversation, but if you're going to help, you can't really be lazy
04I honestly don't have anything to say that accurately portrays my sheer disbelief at such callousness.
its all my fault.
i brought this crap into SW
6the whole moving channels thing seems to be rather difficult, it's never happened once lol
no it's not SS
6no its not
12Aurora, I was joking. I'm already reading up
you need help, we're here
NS it isn't a joke at all
yes... everyone needs a venting every once in awhile
6right
12about being lazy
6NS, remember when you made me rather pissed off?
6thats where i'll leave it
6anyways
12derp
SS I feel that way too a lot
6SS, we are all here obviously, we've shown that. Your decision is ultimately your decision
derpies derping derpidly
there's absolutely nothing wrong with talking with people and trying to communicate your emotions
that's actually the best thing you can do
as a starting point to solve this whole thing
6if you really do want people to talk to, then like Rukario said, maybe a separate channel would be better
/me nods
keeping things inside
never works out very well
6^
6it eases tension to tell people, even more tension when people are able to help
i've kept my feelings bottled up for months.
Well I can say from experience that wanting to talk to people makes me feel like a self-centered drama <censored>, but Rukario and Aurora are right.
i've tried VERY HARD
to keep it hidden on my show
6yeah that's probably why you're so upset
04You need to talk to people.
then you probably have a lot to deflate then
a hell of a lot.
6if you want to migrate that to another channel, I'm sure people will listen
6you might need a night to do that
sadly :/
yeah, a seperate channel would be best
but again
i don't feel qualified to talk about relationships
we're here for you
but i'll be here if you need me
I'll prove that right now

well
i have a class next year that is focused all on SQL
oh god what my eyes
lol sql
and Umbreon, CLI is fun
it's more fun than GUI
not when you are graded on it
yeah
03and dude what
lol
03CLI is not fun
CLI is fun
03not really
btw
03it's only fun
if you know how to use it
03if you're spamming numbers
i got an 81% on my linux test
03and have green text
nice Umbreon
03n a black screen
03+o
lmao
most of the points i lost was because of dumb stuff that he didn't like
03and then fullscreen it
but it worked
03and say you're in teh Matrix
03I*the
drf, that's my computer
like not putting my full name in the commenting section of the programs
03XD
(I used my initials)
then he hated my variable names and marked me off on even more points
lmao
wtf
that's retarded
bash scripting or something?
it was a test on 3 different ones
bash scripts
ah
perl
oh god perl
and c
lol c
that's fine at least
LOL PHP
at least you're not doing assembly yet
LOL HTML
i did MIPS ASM
i had to make a program that asked the user to insert 2 numbers
03oh hm
that all?
yo
03my computer has 8GB of RAM
then have the program output a sum of both those numbers
03and
yah
using all 3 of those languages
03VSphere says it recommends 8168MB
03for the VM
in one sitting
03how much smaller is that
03thyan 8GB
uh
03@calc 8*1024
= 8192
8GB is 8192
03@calc 8192-8162
so that's 24
= 30
03er
03yeah
03@calc 8192-8168
= 24
03that's not bad at all
0324MB of RAM
03for vsphere
03XD
was that he went through each one so fast
niiiice lmao
bash scripts we went through in a day
._.
we went through perl in a day
^ was there ever any doubt
srs?
then we went through c and c+ at the sametime in one day
...
then we reviewed then we had a test
C++ and C?
the fudge
yes
bash scripting is easy
and he wonders why the class average for the test was 60%
perl is fairly okay apparently
03well
03now I need to figure out
03how the frick to install an OS
but C AND C++?
that's not easy
03it has this weird datastore thing
03I can't just toss it an ISO
03I don't think anyway
C++ is retarded in more ways than I can comprehend
and it's not even in minimal english either
like python or perl
o_O
huh
ask Xanbreon
c+ wasn't really in the test
03oh wait
i learnt C++ before c
03I can upload the ISO to it
`-`
03for Windows
i think the only question that even regarded c+ was what was the compiler for it
surprised something saying somethign bad about trixie got posted on EQD....
12same
i don't know either
i only made it through because the test was openbook
03God dang it
03I can't figure out how to get the stupid ISO loaded
i love how the teacher made it a scantron as well
03OMG
03this wants to take forever to load the ISO

03now we install WIndows on the virtual server and see how it runs
03hm
uh
how much do you have?
03500GB total
03I'd like at least 400 for WIndows
03vsphere eats about 4-5GB
I don't need 100GB...
03for itself
03XD
03right
03so how much do you need
0325? 50? LOL
o_O
03100MB?
/me hides
lmaaaaaaao
03no but seriously
03about how much would you want
03I'm just thinking this through
I'll go with 20GB at least
20-30
03OK
up to you
0325?
I don't really mind
03that's probably easiest
sure
03alright
though
linux will need swap space
just saying
03then I'd get around 460-470 for me
03eh
03well
03if I give you 512MB of RAM
03then that's 512MB of swap ;P
that's 512mb of swap
yeah that's fine
XD
03exactly
25 is fine
03LOL
03alright
03LOL it taking forever to expand Windows files over the network
03but whatever
lmao
03It was going to take me over an hour to transfer an ISO from here to there
03I was like [You're f***ing kidding me.jpg]
03I tried inserting the f'ing disc itself, but nooooo
03it kept trying to boot from LAN

hey drf, give me 784mb of ram too!
/me hides
nah 512mb is fiiiiine
/me then explodes the server with memory leaks
oops
03LOL
03I'm still testing if it's efficient with the RAM in the first place
drf do u hav axs to hoshibox?
03yes, why
oh how i love platinum notes

cow334: Hey, does this rag smell like chloroform?
/me (laughs out loud thinking on what he's going to do and..) licks alexxm

fluttercry: :O
otakon: its hard to not look at it when its being streamed...which is why i turned off stream when i saw it
I think Chrysalis might be a little bit hyped...
I hate fanfics. Now clopfics on the other hand
CCCP: Well, I think that Season 2 finale is the best and my most favorite episode of the show so far. Ending the season with a bang like that is perfect. (Season 2 finale grade=A++++++, 100/0) (Season 2 grade=A, 9.5/10):)
Dken2021 More great and powerful ta
I like them if they're well written...
inb4 Chrysalis clopfic.

pablez94: You're welcome!:D
Since Edd Gould died, there's been a new green pony in town with a British accent. Could it be...?
Sorry Wrek|Observing that song creeps me the hell out
/me frowns at Glitch. "Go do your homework."
Meanwhile, what did you name your other kid? Felch?

08,01GabeMoist: that means the motes are dead
I was close.
pablez94: O_O...ok....
08,01i.e., they're not sending readings
I like this music
/me glomps Meanwhile
08,01motes are an example of a mesh network
EVERYONE, you need to look at this
08,01there are field motes, lots of them, and 1 sink mote
HEY! NO Hate.....hate is bad
DeathStar sis us still here yay :D

/me glomps on Meanwhile too
Shane377: eeyup :)
/me is hit by a low flying Trixie.
08,01the sink mote is connected to a compueter, and reads in all the data sent to it wirelessly from the field motes

I thought I got rid of these
Chrysalis: midnight in our time zone,right?
/me punches Shane377 back :)
Meanwhile: doges it wow WOW chill bro throw a knife when you turned back around
(pursing)
08,01so basically, the motes will all act as routers, routing reading packets to the sink mote
Rainbow: I mean not here. As in absent. As in in a location that is somewhere other than this one.
08,01it's kinda awesome
/me ties meanwhile legs together
08,01mesh network.

Rainbow: It is a kick for just giggles, nothing serious.:)
Hey all
lulzbuck?
/me uses Drake as an armchair
Hello Anotherguy! (waves)
TheRainbowDash: Oh, lol
:D
Makes sense
FlareChaser: Pinkie Pie.
Of cause there is, theres just a well set gline
pavarkian: cuz physics r fun
And forget
What are we watching?
03yeah but eventually somebody becomes nice and removes the bans
/me pokes LunaTheBeloved with a feather duster.
03:P
2oh fine, I'll remove it :(
GabeMoist: i would like to give you one million dollars but i would get kicked by Wrek if i did so ill just take take that prize then
/me is now a chair D:
Pinkeh Piey
03I've been "perma banned" from TST several times, umad?
/me giggles
Meanwhile: K, so Meanwhile x Trixie it is!
/me Welcomes Anotherguy with a firm handshake
This is why you get people like me to ban people
Anotherguy: Wrek being awesome
I wouldnt have unbanned you
whats a luzsback
>;[
Question for everypony: Which pony do you think you are most like IRL?
FlareChaser: Yeah, I figured.
03because you're a heartless jerk?
03:D
Raynboh Dahshh
Rainbow: I remember I got three of those on the same day, the mods were just trolling for fun...:D
Rainbow Dash tier of awesome?
Depends if i like you or not
(in the good way)
10Xan has a heart that only an eon can reach
/me dusts LunaTheBeloved.
I feel I am a fluttershy person
03an eon is a unit of time
03so I suppose that makes sense
/me rolls around laughing
TheRainbowDash: what is a luzs link
Meanwhile: Learn to love your ships, and deal with it.
I'm a Twilight person
13AN EON IS ME
pavarkian: which is why i asked her?...
Wait... Meanwhile... you dont like Trixie? O.o
10eon as in Eeveelution
That tickles!
/me runs
banning someone just for having a different outlook than you do is unethical
...without the books, oddly enough
derp
Anotherguy: Yes, it's true. I'm awesome!
I luv propane so ill be like applejack :D
Which pony am I most like irl? Pinkamena.
cow334: Actually, I don't know..maybe just a link to make ponies laugh for the sole purpose of...toast?
/me is unrelenting.
rocklobster: lol :)

03http://chzautocowrecks.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/mobile-phone-texting-autocorrect-dont-you-just-hate-rating-bisexuals.png
Meanwhile: Then maybe I should stay away from you.
Would never have guessed. :P
banning someone for being an idiot is valid
Biglaw: Applejack minus the accent :P
Meanwhile no need to worry more about me saying it ~ i think it's getting boring now ~
Meanwhile is scary pony
TheRainbowDash: well my mind was blown from hearing that
/me hops up and tries to escape
I am most like Twilight Sparkle/Rainbow Dash, in real life.
nope
/me twiddles his moustache.
Ohai Shosties
2nope
you are calling someone who has a different opinion than you do an idiot
I dont really think ethics come into banning people from resources
Actually, scratch that.
Which pony am I most like in real life? umm...Half Pinkie and Half Twilight Sparkle.
that is pretty shallow
03who I think is an idiot other people would disagree
03:P
/me dances on Meanwhile s moustache
Twi/Pinkie
whats the enforce command
I think, I dont know.
Most like Fluttershy in real life.:)
This past weekend i found out i look good in a cowboy hat... What Rarity fan looks good in a cowboy hat!?!? :'(
/me follows LunaTheBeloved, dusting constantly.
I was checked at the airport and when they asked if i had anythin else i say "oh i have this here propane tank"
TheRainbowDash: I'm most like RD, mostly 'cause I AM RD!
yeah, twi/pinkie...
06depends if you mean idiot as in lacking in knowledge, or a gigantic ignorant .. well, idiot.
03XD
/me jumps off a cliff
1,3.
twi/pinkie= twinkie spai
03I mean, I've seen both
/me Finally got Desktop Ponies and will never go back.

Xiodine: Wait...what...
inb4 death
inb4 kick
03but I still won't just ban someone for no reason
Cobellanez: ikr
I dont really care
/me jumps off after LunaTheBeloved and dusts in mid air.
desktop ponies wont work for me
GabeMoist: Oooo (\
06being all "LOL you don't kno <insert irc command here>? gtfo stupid noob >permaban" would be so dumb I would probably die from high blood pressure just seeing it
Holy Crap! I forgot how hideous I look without a beard.

Biglaw: (\

Wrek|Observing: can i fav you its up to you
I just read the ratings post on ED, Mother of Celestia.
I think the "what pony are you most like" kind of fits, but even then I'm torn between several ponies
/me rolls off the couch and lands on LunaTheBeloved's box.
/me gets smooshed
im most like all the ponies...
:o
Wrek what is the name of this programm ?
/me snores.
Paint SAI
I like to have fun like Pinkie but I'm passive in decisions like Fluttershy. I think logically like Twilight. The other ponies I don't relate to.
Brb, time to pirate Paint SAI
/me crawls out from under Meanwhile as flat as a pancake
1,3Xiodine, colors are reserved for channel mods
Powny Paint SAI
^
/me slaps FlareChaser around a bit with a large trout
03ugh brb
I relate to all of them except for applejack
What?
kirzstryfe: and IRC cops and I'm back again
/me dances
05buy a fuckign lisence its no photoshop
How much does Paint SAI cost again?
/me would wonder how high this couch is, since he's probably shorter than LunaTheBeloved.
Fine, I wont pirate it...
05its a fraction of the price
Wrek|Observing How much was it?
okay now i have the name of this programm now the next question where can i buy this awesome painting skills ?
but pirating ist fun
Not a hard worker. Not confident or honest about yourself. Yeah... totally not me.
How tall are you?
Wrek|Observing: well, a fraction of any price is still too much for one that is broke as the Ponyville Town Center
/me dances
/me is powerful but internet is shit
He's about the same height as Trixie
/me snuggles meanwhile
So about 4ft
I make 10k a year. My budget is limited.
/me dances
Seeing him painting reminded me of how much I suck at it
/me is 5'4.
08,01

/me stops snoring, remains asleep.
/me cries where is meanwhile gone :'(

12doubt they'd sell the game on its own in the shop though
icybeauti: yup its an mestory
03none of these songs have any profanity in them XD
Hahaha:D
04It's just a way to curb resales and get more money
yep
12pretty much
I thought Spike was holding a pack of ciagarettes
that's an adorable picture. and hello, everypony!
anyone heard Ich Will before
gotta admit, uncolored jewel looks like a condom
12but I still like it
Its the onion, its just silly
12so no problems
I thot it was a pack of cigs in Spikes hand at first :o but then i came to my senses :P
I have located the complete United States CFR or code of federal regulations
(O )_____(o) wy would yall think that
Hello Sylandest! (waves)
Hello Sylandest.
TBH I thought twilight compared to a human would've been taller
cow334 I've been messed up since little. Around 10, I discoverd the other side of stuff.
/me waves at TheRainbowDash and ZappyTheUnicorn
03I'm fine paying for *good* games, but I absolutely refuse to buy crap with DRM
including CFR 47 which is the FCC portion
Humans would be freaking giants in equestria then O_o
everyone doing good today?
icybeauti: oh god im sorry
icybeauti You found your butt?
icybeauti: Only a few months ago, I discovered it. Now, I'm hooked to that stuff.
hello Sylandest
2Drf, I don’t mind piracy, I even pirate a few things myself but I don’t like it when you try to get other people to.
03I think the only regulations for this station is that we have to say the name of the station every X amount of minutes
TheRainbowDash: please dont do that
howdy, cow334!
every hour
Sylandest: Eeyup. Are you doing good?
wrek u streaming music aswell
hello Sylandest how are you
at the very least
05y
cow334: Wait, what...
03I think it's more often for ours
03as the shows are only an hour long
that is called the top of hour legal ID
damn it i hate getting cut and not realizing im cut
Hahaha, now that's a nice jewel :D
Needs more Flare Chaser x Colgate... <.< >.> Nah, I already got enough pics of that, haha...
cow334 It's cool. Anotherguy: Sorta :/ TheRainbowDash Ga-ross!
or remember getting cut
05Biglaw: its the angle
But, Wrek this is so..D'awww
TheRainbowDash: nothing moooooo
Aww....:D
03not sure if it's different for a low-power station
Its just...so...D'aww
who want's to watch an awesome series ? you do ? here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUDfoZGhLjE
Well, the show is called My LITTLE Pony. They should logically be smaller in stature than a human.
I calculated I've been a Brony for about 9 weeks, the first episode being Daring Do *most recent at the time*
Well, actuall, it was...5 years ago, my bad.
I operate under CFR 47 part 97 and there are reduced ID times for that
i dont no who would clop to ponys that is just sick
05my headcanon is that a normal pony is between knee and waist height of a human
What, I didn't want to flood accidentally.
every ten minutes
Wrek|Observing ah makes sense
03yeah that's probably right
part 97 by the way is amateur radio
03I was thinking every 10 or 20
cow334: I'm doing pretty good, working on an essay for Communications. how about you?
2that's up to you if you want to take the risk of pirating things
03"risk"
03just don't be an idiot and you'll be fine
Wrek|Observing: I have the same prediction.
03so yeah, I can understand why you're scared
/me hides
I've been a brony since june of last year. It'll be my 1 year anniversary this year.
05asskisser.
btw i'm bored so expect random things at random times
Wrek u should try Ich Will
icybeauti: Happy anniversary! :D
2hm? I'm just as bad as you when it comes to that XD
And frankly, keep in mind that some of the G1 cartoons featured humans. Compare the ponies to the human children they worked with, and compare the children to adult humans, and that's how tall we would be to the ponies.
Shane377 ehmagawd I love that song!!
05i dont take requests, besides i dont feel liek rammstein atm
Sylandest: i was in a fight today cause high schoolers dont no when to shut up but other than that i pass my ultra hard teas
*test
Awesome then icybeauti!
theres rammstein sonne pmv
Well, I was able to stop listening to This Day Aria....because I got this stuck in my head ALL DAY LONG http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29-q7YnyUmY
2but I'd never ask someone eles to
03well
cow334 shoukda loved and tolerated the S*yay*t out of them
Sylandest: and you are the first person i told that to on here
2else*
cow334: ooh, i see. I hope you're alright?
cow334: wtf dont fight people.
We would probably be too big to actually ride them.
03I'm not telling people to pirate games, but I';m against blindly throwing money away because the developers tell you to.
03Case in point, Ubisoft
speaking of songs, this day aria was best
mhmm. They should hide famous people as backround ponies, the way they did with "The Big Lebewski"
Cookie monster singing Du Hast is the best
Biglaw: no i couldnt i tryd to but no i couldnt
Anyway, I need to restart my computer.
Kandarihu Don't
im still trying to get winter wrap up outta my head
03You actually get a better experience if you pirate the game due to their stupid DRM :P
im sorry twilight_sprinkle
12they don't
cow334: actually, if you take a look at the human mind and take into account the sexualization of cute that our society has going on all the time, it's the only logical conclusion.
Krakass /)
and the best pet
http://tinyurl.com/7u88jf3
12I know what stuff is going on
cow334 that's okay
(\
12I know they're charging a lot for such
12but I enjoy it
12done
12=>
cow334: it better not happen again, or ill kick yo ass
03they make you buy stupid plastic figurines to unlock features
pony_1900: It was an awesome song, indeed, but not my favorite. That title goes to Smile or Winter Wrap Up.:)
Dark_Horst: well okay
this day was going to be perfect?
03that's as bad as it gets
03>_>
I had to shave this off. I cannot wait for my beard to grow back right and proper.
nothing good on right now... Ill be back for movie night on friday
twilight_sprinkle: well i didnt win the fight
12...
hmm i turned on my desktop ponys last night with 2 random ponys and trixies stage... now i have 9 different ponys and the 2 i started with are gone :P
12doood
13These "stupid plastic figurines" also happen to be collectibles to some people, deal with it :P
12play the game before you get to know it
I'm truly amazed at how fast the songs of the finale were remixed/used, just a few hours after the the second part there was already an Archie remix of love is in bloom :O
ha
but i didnt cry ethier i never cry
03I don't WANT to play it because >DRM
Anotherguy: don't what? Don't think of riding them (which I shot down) or don't restart (which I need to do more often)
2drf, what if they made you pay that and you didn't get them? XD
03I've said this ehough
?
We should make PMV out of wolfmother songs. They have one song called "White Unicorn" and it'd be a perfect rarity vid.
Mmm Cadence Aria.
12you can literally beat the game with the figures they provide you when you get the game
cow334: that said, it is quite surprising how many are supposedly repelled by the thought.
cow334: i wouldnt expect you to, obviously it was a provocation and you fell for it
05ok 1 last song
and suddenly Twilight
03yeah but there's obviously stuff ou can't do without buying more
03*you
....
Kandarihu Both?
>Randomnerd has biker beard
bottom line: people lie B)
03:P
smexy twi
12if you're OCD 100% everything then yes
TheGreatAndPowerfulT im watching it now its good
12you would need
Thats just silly and awesome
12roughly
wrek then whats happening after the last songZ?
Alright then Wrek|Observing, do you know who would be streaming next after you?
twilightlicious
125 more figures at the least
I know this song
03Let me put it this way
Yup. I was a space-trucker this weekend, lol
I'm hoping SuperBrony64 will
03Ubisoft games
03are like
Brushie Brushie Brushie.
05no clue
He, twilight's nice with glasses, never though of that
Oh....
03"You can't even play single player if you're disconnected from our servers for 'anti piracy reasons'"
03OK finme
03well
12> Your opinion
03their servers die for a day
get ready to use 3 hours of your life part 2 and 3 are about one 1:30 long and part 4 is not out muahahaha
is SuperBrony64 even there
12> Not mine
03You can't play the game
03that YOU PAID FOR
(I was in a scenario paintball game based on "Spaceballs"
03because THEIR servers died
twilight_sprinkle: what i won the last time the only reason and i say the only reason he won is cause he got his little bic_ of friends and they jumep me i lasted for a while but i couldnt do it they are mean and i dont like them
03Greatest idea ever, right?
SuperBrony64: You there?
12whut
12LOL
03But if you just pirated the games, no problems.
Narolas: Well, it gives her the more...'Sexy' look.
03Soital, true story
I noticed Dr.Whoove getting attacked by the changlings in the episode. I thought he was goign to bust out the screwdriver and kill them :D.
03it's why Ubisoft basically rage-quitted the PC gaming industry
03because everybody complained about THEIR stupid policies
03:P
cow334: last time? wtf is with all the fighting
Kinda, it's the nerdy feeling it gives that i like
FlareChaser: I really like that sexy looks of Twilight....so...inviting to me.... - Dash
12this isn't ubisoft though
03It still makes me laugh how idiotic they ewre being
03*were
12Meh
2it's Activision
03but the point still stands, you can't play the game without having extra addons that require you to pay money
twilight_sprinkle: well last tim is cause he wouldnt shut up about me likeing the show so i told him to box it out
icybeauti, Dr. Whooves doesn't kill.
03say I were to borrow the game from a friend
12> Judging game even though not played it
12;3
TheRainbowDash Did you hit that?
03they didn't want to loan me the figures because "they're collectibles"
Well usually he doesn't
03that means I can't play the stupid thing
12Nope
and Dark_Horst well okay its not my opion
Aww yeah, this song!:)
TheRainbowDash: That reminds me... *googles Colgate* Alright, time to find socks.
03catch my drift?
12you can play the game
Krakass Or drive them away in that case.
*opionion
12to the end
Well...... see ya later.
Anotherguy: Aww yeah, sure I did!
03without having any of the figures?
12if you want to 100% collect the smaller items
05yes twilight, I'd love to read you a bedtime story
12then you have to get the figures
/me licks Wrek
cow334: youre mad at a guy cuz he made fun of you being a brony?..
:O
Wrek|Observing: I'm sorry, Twilight already left....:P
Pluse Dr. Whooves still hasn't figured out how to hold his screwdriver.
stay away from Twi, Wrek...
12and its 5 more
i dont trust you with her.
Krakass Oh right. Doesn't he hold it in his mouth?
This day aria gives me chilles EVERY time i hear it
Hm, not sure i like those pony faces, they're cool but i like my normal faces too :-O
03you can finish the game without having any of the figurines?
10Okay yeah, you guys have all made your points. DRF, no need to further drag it out
Yup
twilight_sprinkle: no not only that he was talking a lot of trash and wouldnt shut up and he spit in my food and called me garbage so i had to do it he got on my nervers i couldnt ignore him
yd u kick me wrek
pony_1900 diarhhea?
12No, but the figures go with the game dood o_O
05guess 3 times
03> say I were to borrow the game from a friend
03> they didn't want to loan me the figures because "they're collectibles"
03> that means I can't play the stupid thing
12You buy, they come with and such
cause u h8 me
3 times what?
or i licked u
Shane377: dont ask him that
12but yeah I'm gonna go play it now
05WRONG
like a euphoric diarhhea
1 down.
cow334 Ouch. Someone out staples in my hair today during my study hall. At least I'm not out of the stable in school.
05,15so, have I missed anything good?
2 to go
Shane377: dont do it Wrek|Observing has good reasons to kick poeple like me lol
12what kinda friend would say that
12but in responce
i kno y he kicked me
12> once you put the figure in the game
cow334: why not tell someone
12> it stays there until you switch out
im sorry icybeauti
05,15I got absorbed in Blue Planet
cow334: well in that case, facepunch
I remember back in the day in high school so idiot put a staple in my finger.
05fluttercry:
fluttercry: You missed epic drawings.
cow334 Still not as bad as what happened to you.
it works miracles
05,15Oceans are fraking awesome man
03yeah but then I'd need their entire Xbox or whatever
03I'm not talking about the 3DS
12for 3DS you can have up to 2 figures at a time
i want GTA 5
icybeauti: its okay
TheGreatAndPwerfulT i never played phoenix wright is it pretty good
Krakass : Ouch

Yeah the worst part was the idiot was me.
03I swear I saw that as a still image, but that also works
i havent even been able to play gta 4 succesfully, it didnt work good on my pc
Krakass: Bwahaha
CCCP i got bad news and goodnes about gta 5 for u wat do u want first
Kids, don't let your friends play with staplers. They're not toys.
icybeauti: what da faq who would do that!
twilight_sprinkle: well no i dont want no one to worry for stuff about me so i just fought him and one
never cared for GTA myself
*won
Shane377: bad news first
05,15Dat Twilight
twilight_sprinkle: i had to put him in his place
/me yawns
2I got both, the XBox 360 and the 3DS Versions
05there we go
icybeauti, no it doesn't. If it did, more people would enjoy it.
Morning everypony.
Krakass some kid in my brother's grade put a staple in his toungue. mario_pony I've been the scapegoat for my entire school career
05,15yes
05,15very
05final song is sung,
icybeauti: i know i wish it would have an end to it
Hello XAX.
03right, and on the Xbox 360 you'd have to transfer the entire save for something like that LOL
03also
05hope ya liked
03>Gamefly or similar services
like a sexy librarian
its for the ds right
it's
03if I were to get the game as a rental
03it's not going to come with figurines
03LOL
cow334: with painfull touches to the nose and mouth area, i hope?
bad news is that knowing rockstar they'll stick to their normal release dates of mayish which means next may
Spectacular Wrek|Observing. Also nice job with the wood carving.
Any movies/series planned for tonight ? (or whatever time of fay it is for you) ?
I sure did Wrek|Observing, and thanks for leaving at this picture! That Twilight....no!:D Black screen!
cow334: id just tell someone
12why would they even put that game in rentals
icybeauti: oh my god im so sorry if i was there would have done something for him im sorry
CCCP u want goodnews now?
BLAKKA BLAKKA
cow334, it does stop.
icybeauti: wow that is messed up
03that's my problem with it.
Dark_Horst: worst i made him cry and bleed
Once you get out of high school people are still just as stupid.
cow334: how long till graduation
03They're effectively saying "pay us lots of money or gtfo"
But they don't take it out on others.
Krakass: no it will never
I hope SuperBrony64 grabs the stream....
cow334: you go, bro!
can we switch back to mips now?
12your best bet is to try it at a friends
cow334 It stops in college. But the reason he stapled his tongue was because he did it himself.
thanks for the stream Wrek|Observing ~
03so how about this, you want me to play the game first before I judge it? You buy it for me then :P
^^
03because if I Can't just rent the stupid thing
03then no
Dammit cow334. Don't make me beat you up.
hey
/me is still very jealous of Wrek.
Shane377: well thats a given XD
Krakass: People are stupid everywhere, from the beginning to the end, doesn't matter where, what age, what type of job, stupid people everywhere
Dark_Horst: thanks but i didnt like it
12I don't really care
cow334: Woah, what is happening now?
Shane377: wuts the good news?
Krakass: lol
13How about just stay neutral to it altogether :P
12just don't attack something you don't really know too much about
2drf, would you rather if there was NO game? :/
and icybeauti oh im sorry
Night everypony. Awesome pictures Wrek|Observing.

cow334 Still, remeber you have an entire community to back you up :)

rdibp: I lol'd
I'm such a noob on this chat, How do i respond to someone in particular ? just type the name ?

Night ZappyTheUnicorn don't let NMM or Molestia bite
cow334: i ignored, worked out fine.
Woohoo, ValtheJean is going to stream pure awesomeness.

Deal, on it.
Narolas, if you type their name it pings them.

icybeauti: yup thank you
cow334 /me hugs cow334
12Skylanders <3
cow334: did the tip you?
2Skylanders
twilight_sprinkle, if its really sexy they just link to it and don't show the image
thats why i use a knife
2:3
Ham Sandwiches*
12They're making a sequel =)
because you are :$
jk

CCCP: lol seriously?
oh
mario_pony: no
*hugs back icybeauti

so this is a nub question: how do you type a reply to someone here?
ha flavors of ice cream
CCCP for what?
RaveBrony: Aw dude! You're not BAD!you just need more Practice, and thats exactly what you're doing with the Pic your making me.
CCCP its okay
I am loyal to my ponies...:P
/me vomits
apparently you just type the name pony_1900 , it pings them
pony_1900: begin typing name and press tab
FlareChaser: Of course! :D
pony_1900: in private?
i was kicked
Here, have this song. Keeps me up everytime: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVPvzX-AeSM&list=FLaKCn8LyYp3lQWFAHcm9znA&index=28&feature=plpp_video
mario_pony: what tip
2Drake :|
12Personally I can't wait~ <3
04What?
RaveBrony: Work harder, and you will someday will be good as Wrek!
03being somebody who wants to go into the computer industry, I won't stand for things like digital rights management. The actual game itself is irrelevant. If Pokémon made a game that required you to buy crappy figures in order to play it, I'd be every bit against it
:P
04I expressed my opinion of Skylanders.
CCCP: lol boom headshot
Hellllllllllllllo everypony!
wait icybeauti no links or you can get banned
http://fav.me/d4xfkf5b Here is the awesome poster for Season 2!:)
04In the form of bowel movements.

Narolas: kk i think i got it thanks! :$
What...
cow334: you know tip you
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4495/
Dat broken link
Why you no work?!:[
mario_pony: i loled at that
cow334 opss.....Still learning ropes.
cow334: cause your a cow
03what I'm against isn't so much the game itself but the *concept* of it
rdibp: O_O
12I don't recall asking people's opinions on this game
/me hugs Wrek|Observing
12just that I was happy to get cynder
forget it
I'm baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack!
Krakass: well you can say that i got my ass kickd bye four guys
-_-
rdibp: Wat.
:$
...
12I already know half of tst don't like the game
03>implying that one needs to ask opinions in a public channel
04>public channel;
12=/
mario_pony: well you can say that
04CYNDER HAS BOOBS
04HOW IS THAT GOOD AT ALL
There you go.
icybeauti: lol i

This clip loops, doesn't it, RX-78-3-SweetieBot ?
ooooh, more chrysalis
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4519/
12yeah point being I already know you don't like it
2It’s one thing to not like something, it another to try getting other people to not like it
12LOL
is that still wrek?
the fukkireta one?
13How about this k
04Honestly, if I played Skylanders I'd probably like
04it
Mine is a white screen
04But those design choices urgh
I mean, after ten minutes.
13and discuss something better
Lucky I'm a girl. I don't get beat up.
it doesnt for me
12Fair enough Drake =)
http://www.redbubble.com/people/brann/works/8362036-colgate I bought this shirt, am I awesome yet?
Dat Shadeless VinylScratch
04Like Eons
13;3
Maybe we'll see ponies, maybe we'll see curses. Who knows?
04Eons are always fun to discuss
I can tell the song is looped, of course.
yes
Scenario paintball games are sweet. I haven't been to one in years. Last one I was at was 1500 vs 1500 or so.
12meh
12;3
03One eon is approximately 400 years
03or so
03what else is there to discuss
/me hides
FlareChaser 20% cooler
her eyes were the same color as her glasses right?
Krakass: Lemme guess: Invasion of Normandy?
besides, if you want it nearly endless theres a 10 hour long version
TheRainbowDash: It's... Bootiful.
04Eons are also floofy, for the most part.
icybeauti: yes you can
04hey drf
12Hmm
icybeauti: by other girls
... an eon is not a unit of time
04We could get into an argument about plane and plain as well if you want
twilight_sprinkle: tommorow if i see him im going to go up to him and fight him one on one
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/04/season-2-finale-sets-rating-records.html Ponies has set records and higher standards!:)
You won't see curses if you don't piss off Val
03"You keep using that word, I don't think you know what it means" is my response to people referring to "eons" as something other than a unit of time
03:P
FlareChaser: You make that shirt 20% cooler
Randomnerd, I can't remember what the scenario was. Wayne Dollack put it on.
mario_pony Where I live, girls don't beat up each other. It's more verbal stuff.
Biglaw: Exactly!
its an Aeon
03Xanbreon it's representative of a long time
13Why do I keep typing twitter instead of imgur into the url
not eon
04LOL ANGEL
>___<
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4507/
06yeah because it totally isn't a rather wwidely used word for eeveelutions
cow334: don't do it
Girls are so cruel to one another :(
FlareChaser Btw thanks for the comment /)^3^(\
cow334: whatever. it wont solve anything, but do what you want.
Randomnerd ikr
03also Espeon, the only place I've ever heard it used as such is in this channel. LOL
/me math and science geek
2I have all the starters so far :3
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4502/
eon =! Aeon
Biglaw: You're welcome
12For both Xbox and 3DS?
You're down south, then?
04drf
2yep
03it's pronounced the same way o_O
mario_pony: but wy he one bye cheating he cant do that its not fair
12<3
when I see two girls fightin' I do this face :[
Unless ur spelling it weirdly
04maybe that's because you don't really hang out with people who use it elsewhere?
CCCP: lol
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sob1t-iUCmE :V
:D
twilight_sprinkle: :3
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzsxfO7dBlA "This Day Aria":)
cow334: you're just gonna make it worse
I saw girls fighting for a shirt. Srsly.
TheRainbowDash: i looooooove that song :D
Anotherguy wow...
Hell yeah, Cadence Aria.
Aww yeah CCCP!:D
excuse me for a moment
03I'm on other IRC channels too, just because they aren't all "OMFG EEVEELUTIONS ARE THE BEST THING KNOWN TO MAN AND YOU'RE A SINNER IF YOU DIAGREE" doesn't mean I don't hang out with other POkémon fans.
Anotherguy: JB shirt?
03and nobody else uses it as such.
:$
12and I don't see problems asking a question about something I was talking about dood
12but I digress
Context
12too many eons ;3
A shirt you could get anywhere
03also wtf, each version of the game has its own figurines?
/me vomits even more
CCCP: It is that time of the day where you listen to this song non-stop for 24 hours?:D
mario_pony: fine i wont do it your right ill be the bigger person and let go of it
AWWWWWW YEEEEAH
12?
03that's just plain abusive.
You ponies have seen the interrobang pie version of This day aria ?
2no drf, just the 3DS

You're*
cow334: pinkie promise?
06the last 20 minutes or so various things like irony and such has just been OFF DA CHARTS
otakon: no he is still streaming
so im getting this tiny video window saying i dont have the right plugin, should i click that or close it?
Biglaw: It's AWWWWW YEEEEAH for the Aria.
He is?
05no im not
I find you equating physical objects to DRM to be tenuous at best
that's weird, I've got nothing on LimeV
mario_pony: yes i give you my pinke promise
12I kinda understand what people mean now anyway
03it IS though
aha
cow334 recite it
13[18:30] [@ValtheJean] alright everyone, give me some time to set up
O_o How in the world did I sleep for 2.5 hours?
03you have to have the figurines to beat the game, plain and simple
I bet he's from Georgia
pony_1900 Is it a ad?
Biglaw: okay
Okie Dokie Lokie!
yay!
Hell yeah, valthejean
eeeyup
03It would be one thing if they were just collectable and didn't actually affect the agme in any way
yay Shizuka thank you love
That was a question for Krakass though
12> can't talk about something you'd like to talk about with others if majority of people dislike it
Buck Yeah!
03but they're forcing you to buy stuff in order to beat a game you already paid for
04drf, Skylanders is different to other games by the use of figures.
1,3lol
06isn't the solution simple anyay
eeeyup
04Don't like it? Don't play the game.
06don't like it, don't play it
I'm originally from PA and now I'm in ND
Its part of the way the game works, its not something simply designed to limit your ability to use the game
{o{
04Espeon
Can we watch G4 ponies?
04Hivemind
;._>+_>__._>_
mario_pony: i cross my heart hope to fly stick a cupcake in my eye
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R90qzCl5m8 If you like pnies and Minecraft together, this might be of intrest to you.:)
I can guess what we're gonna watch
03Espeon, that's like saying "Don't like what Kony is doing in Africa? Don't support him"
PA so you've played at Skirmish USA?
03but yet
03Look at the Internet
good evening all.
Yup

Im sorry for posting this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__HeE6NWmDE
(ponies)
2,14 unfortunate
12thats fine and everything if you don't like it, just don't want to hear it 100 times
2,14 well, I WAS gonna show off my new audio cable and stream my PSP
When you say physical DRM, what comes to mind are dongles for example for highend CAD software
aw
:'(
Guys....
06yeah because the kony situation is the same as VIDEO GAMES
2,14 but for some reason getting the audio now disables the video
ValtheJean: wy
The game got paused at 2am because someone twisted their ankle in a groundhog hole
that feel when you know you were supposed to do something but need to rest your eyes first, then forget whatever it was you were supposed to do....
06i know you meant it as an example but
06wtc
ValtheJean: no stream it please
2Okay so, some people like Skylands and others don’t. We’re going to leave it at that.
04"Look at X someone has to be against it". Ok sure.
cow334: yaay~
Also that Kony <censored> was so funny
Ow.
Sweetie Belle: OH COME ON!
03hey, neither situation is personally affecting me
2Anyone who wants to talk about talk about it and people who have a problem with that need to keep to themselves
BRONYSTATE, WHY DO YOU HAVE PORNOGRAPHIC ADS?! This is WAY too severe.
CCCP: Wait, what the hay is this? I never seen this before.:P
04That's like
wait, what?
mario_pony: yaay
ValtheJean why not record from a mic?
05we dont
cow334: no sound or no video, he can't
04completely logical way to look at the world.
2,14 Otakon: I can only stream the video or the sound
Cypresswolf: Dat feel...
03>Freedom of speech
People really though that anything would actually change
Vordox Wrong site I believe
that sucks
Vordox: Wait, you see those on your screen now?
otakon: oh okay
lols
You just had a pornographic add.
Hi everypony :)
2,14 and recording from my mic would record my annoying family
Stuff like that happense from time to time, seeing as it's a all outdoors.
03if you're allowed to say how much you love something
ValtheJean: I know, cow334 asked
03I'm allowed to say how much I hate it
05the streamprovider may have, but thats not us. if thats the case, get some fucking adblock
Hello Bobeh! (waves)
TheRainbowDash: its some crappy music video that is worse than friday
12Just can't believe I can't talk about something I was probably going to discuss with others who may like it for 5 mins and get rar'd at LOL
03It's plain and simple.
howdy, bobeh
04god
Hey Bobeh1
04you know
2,14 Vordox: the adds are based on the computer that visits
04I'm gonna shut up
Hey Bobeh!
04because
hi Bobeh.
06you know i
Ads are linked to your searches and visited websites, probably ... lawl
otakon: hehe troll face
04this is playing hell
06100% predicted that
I'm not adblocking this site, it would not benefit the cause of the stream.
:D
04on my mood
Wrek|Observing: I never heard of fuking adblock, is it any good?
2,14 so it must have seen your browsing history and played you pornographic sites
Lololol
05Vordox. yes it would
Ouch
lol
But the ads is a revenue, no?
05cause it would keep people complainign liek you are now out of the chat
Vordox: yep, ads are dependant on what you visit
05not to us
05its not oru adds
Vordox, bronystate doesn't have ads for revenue
i never seen a single add on bronystate o right i have add block on ifrefox lol
freedom of speak does not mean you have the right to force people to hear your speech
05our*
2,14 the ads don't generate us money
2,14 at all
CCCP: Holy hay, this is bad.:D
2,14 we make a grand total of 0 dollars
06freedom of speech, #1 get out of jail free card besides "Joke's on you I was only pretending to be retarded, i troll u!"
13we do it out of pocket
04We're not getting any money
TheRainbowDash: ikr
2drf, so you're saying if it's okay to hug someone it's also okay to punch them?
Ah, geezus. ><
03um, what?
The mods come now....out of their lurking areas...:D
I thought it was that.
happens*
13we make a grand total of -{cost of internet for 19+ mods}
03how is physically hurting someone relating to just saying things o_O
10Espeon, lolMonopoly
Vordox: delet your cookies
Also, I have never visted that ad, should probably do a virus scan also.
0 dollars are better than no dollars
...
Shizuka, have thought of accepting ads from Stallionbate?
RoflBot: 0 dollars is no dollars...
RoflBot not really
fire mods for cheaper stream
lol
agreed Roflbot...wait 6_9
Well, you may not get paid, but we love to be here with you guys and see all the streams! :)
06yeah when someone else use far-fetched examples you point it out
2What you’re saying is, if you can do say something, it’s okay to do the opposite of that as well
Does the website even cost that much a month/year anyway?
13okay guys, seriously stfu now cuz it's getting you nowhere
So the ads are..for what exactly?
06my sides are moving on their own
1,3Vordox, make sure you check to see if something loaded a win32 file onto your computer, that's very serious virus you should get removed as soon as possible
guys guys guys
13please
dat bass canon
Sylandest: right we love them no matter what
Isn't love and hugs a currency ? ;(

Vordox: Really, its a huge virus that could destroy everything!
10etc.
1,3Vordox, make sure you check to see if something loaded a win32 file onto your computer, that's very serious virus you should get removed as soon as possible
/me just said out loud "Finally the moment has arrived for me to be one lucky bride"
05FlareChaser stay out
2[17:40] Okay so, some people like Skylands and others don’t. We’re going to leave it at that.
2[17:40] Anyone who wants to talk about talk about it and people who have a problem with that need to keep to themselves
Alright Kirz, I'll check now.
When season 2 hits netflix, are they going to change Derpy?
2I'm not going to say it again
Good for you Randomnerd

icybeauti: God I hope not...
Most likely

This song is too catchy!
Pray!!1
06hang on I know what we need here
This scene.. gets me every fucking time.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4JvFtqfjmQ
It's a moo point
05Shizuka: perhaps we should clarify that somewhere?
Lol
12-w-
ah
/me gets a camera
05hmm...
06everyone, watch http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0la5DBtOVNI 50 times
03but it's not rape if they want it too
04That wouldn't be rape though/.
2O_o
03:D
06then 100 more
I think I'm gonna go now, I'm gonna play L4D2 single player...
06THEN COME BACK
Dashie_Dashie Same....
/me runs
03yeah exactly
03XD
06Thanks
10Drake
Still,I asked, why is there ads here if it's not..for nothing?
10Oh, so you want it?
04But of course
Must keep listening to fukkireta to fully purge it from my head.
CupcakeWarrior: Funny....
hmm
MUST
2,14 it's because the software we USE to stream creates ads
2this place is looking like a random Pokemon Online server right now
NOT
STOP
Yes!!
Vordox, the add is from the company providing the stream
it worked
12I tried Pokemon Online
ad*
or serebii chat
/me run
12EW
s
13only during movie night and live episodes, it distributes chat load
04Espeon
03you know what's worse than Serebii chat
04that video is win
03is #PocketMonster
03s
Aha, so it's the STREAM maker that gets revenue...weird.
@ValtheJean I only see ads when I'm accessing the site in school. I might be because they don't have ad block in school.
12nothing can be worse
13the stream service
03#PM is definitely worse
And that is why you use ABP
03because half of #SPP is in #PM
03LOL
12I don't think I want to try
06In my ideal world that owuld be part of the first time startup of every internet browser in the world.
I don't
Aye. Weird. So it's a linked revenue, based on who uses the stream.
Origin of the phrase moo point. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLwYpSCrlHU
I find that very...erm...cheating?
Or illegal, even.
Vordox I guess so.
I was in there for a while
13operating a connection with enough bandwidth to support the hundreds to thousands of people we get every week is obscenely expensive
even had voice
03I was too
06damn you W key go climb a wall of... suggestively shaped objects
13that's why we outsource it to streaming services
04XD
Aha, so it's a minor evil.
03uso was a fricking half-op in there
03and then got bannd

Okay. You see, I appreciate the irony of the actor complaining about there being too much blood in movies, and immediately dying in a bloody mess. I don't appreciate all the blood and gore, especially when he's spewing more blood than could possibly be in the average adult body.
Whatever happened to the autokick?
Not the worst movie I've seen.
Kandarihu: the gore is part of the show
/me 11,01licks Xiodine

Network lag in that case ^
1860s are best 60s

Shizuka: sorry dear, wasn't trying to. But Polydunami was having issues and then I was as well so I thought it might be the case
Some mod should stream 60s spidey sometime
dat dubbing

Where?
To play this game, go to MapCrunch, select “hide location”, make sure you have all countries unselected, and click go. What this will
do is drop you in a random part of the world. It’s as if you woke up on the side of a road in an unfamiliar country. The goal of the
game is to find your way to an airport so you can return home.
Bonus Hard Mode: No using outside sources, and that includes using google maps to figure out your location from signs or landmarks
actually, there is a nathan explosion pony
let me get it for you
Pika pika kawaii desu sugoi

Thank god the real VA's didnt do this
Id say the G4 live show definately could be better. But its not horrifying
Ghosties: aww Yeah!

That kid
Gun_Dealer_Xephos: can you rent me a gun and may I buy a single bullet?
TheRainbowDash: YOY WHATS SUP

Live action G4 ponies have left me in despair!
How long is this? Just curious.

/me no longer has head........yet is still alive
I'll never be able to look at MLP the same way again MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
Shane377: Yeah, not during a livestream.
03so I was talking to this guy who works there
dear lord
That moment you imagine a spider crawling next to you...
03like "Yeah we need people to host shows"
...........(goddammit)
ohai LadyCanary, how are you doin?
no
03I told him I was interested
oooooh, i get it. this is cleverly disguised stage porn
my teacher tried to tell us that IIS is better than apache
oh ok so i can link a website or something right?
I wonder if people paid to see this
03and their weekly meetings are Tuesdays at 8PM
lol
CupcakeWarrior: they did
oh god that awful acting
nope

Price=1 soul

...
Heheh
03the guy liked the name, too
*shots otakon with spas*
03"DRF super show" :P
Also, you guys, Im just saying, ponies 24/7 gets a wee bit boring, and honestly, Im getting sick of people complaining. Enough already.
No. This is a stage show of FiM that caters EXCLUSIVELY to the target demographic, which most of us are NOT
OH U!
Same price as a Metroid hug
:D
SCOUT: I would say me, but I lack a head atm, I'm communicating through telepathy
03unless someone can think of something better
ded yet?
would http://cristgaming.com/pirate.swf be allowed? or do i need permission for that?
I give him permission.
03I had to come up with a name on the spot
Southerners and Rednecks, Know the difference
03so I used that

@Ghosties. I thought that ''Also Sprach Zarathrustra'' reference would help
This is going to be a very bad season for NY Apples. It was too warm, so the trees weren't dormant long enough.
2,14 I am immune to kind-hearted requests

Okay. Lister woke up 200 years in the future, after something (I forgot) stole Red Dwarf and hid it on one of many earthlike planetoids.
x-x

B-but Ima canary, Val :(

oh, stfu Rimmer
If you're in trouble he will save the day, hes brave and he's fearless come what may, without him the mission would go astray....

LadyCanary: how are you today dear?
03he said keep it in the green, maybe touching yellow a tad
13was ist this acid trip i am watching

03but not in the rred
03*red
Remember, he woke up in deep sleep with long hair and fingernails.
:D
13is this aquabats?
Any one got my Also Sprach Zarathrustra joke
their processing should be similar to mine
03but you're saying the radio station should automatically normalize?
XD PACE
i have my gun shop open
Shizuka: it's Red Dwarf
Kandarihu: it is intentionally not explained
...*SPACE
03because if it's too *quiet*...
/me is dead agaib
03I'd have to manually boost it
04OH SHI-
Red dwarf Shizuka. it's a classic
my AM stereo station uses a five band compressor/limiter along with AGC
lol
:D
they can't normalize
lol
you should
otakon: Really great :3 finished a research paper early. And you?
DeathStar Wheres my Scones SiS?
but they can compress
IN SPAAAAAAAAACE
just listen to the air monitor if you have any doubts
wait, I think my dad's home. It's probably him
actually they can
I rather prefer CARTOON my little pony friendship is magic. Is that specific enough?
LadyCanary: okay, but the "trolling"
Okay.
04Val should show Max Headroom after this
that is what an AGC does
Shane377: I ate them :)
hehe
uses FACE FLASH to revive twilight_sprinkle
...
13ja he-he-he should
GRRR sis
Ghosties: if he has it
it automatically compensates for loud or soft passages in songs
normalize requires future knowledge
eeyup
2,14 Oh Ghosties, you know I never take requests :P
Face FLASH!
13i thi-thi-think that's a good idea
lie mode
nyyyope
HEY found my ball
/me is revived
Thats just mean DeathStar
The Finale didn't have enoug Luna
Max Headroom?
rdibp: have you not learnt that the mods show what they want yet?
eeyup
lol
/me hands Shane377 scons "jk here they are"
/me is revived
Whats that?
:D
/me shrugs "It would be neat to watch though

CupcakeWarrior: Who the heck said that?

CupcakeWarrior: Because who doesn't want a Luna inspired blackberry-jasmine ceylon blend tea?
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
CupcakeWarrior: I thot it was only 13 Confirmed episodes O.o
CupcakeWarrior: Nope. 26. 13 by one studio, 13 by another.
Aircrafter : Maybe if they didn't look like animu monsters
in fact I recommend trying that during the music to be sure you are not distorting
Oh
WHAT
Yay!!
NO Tom, you must know
Alister: Ya...Too uh...Shiney.

That makes me very sad, Tom
