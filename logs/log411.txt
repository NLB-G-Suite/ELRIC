10k then
10I WAS TOO DISTRACTED THINKING ABOUT PUELLA MAGI, FORGIVE ME
10:P
1212XD
1212like the 3DS?
/me runs
Eenope.
yea
then again I tried that too in Walmart
by cranking the 3D slider only half way up I did not get a headache!
Shouldnt you be doing something with TGaPT?
nor disorientation
wut ?
1212nice
:P
03nickstr, you need to try it for more than like 10 minutes LOL
I did at one point
1212ah
but then again this was with the 3D slider cranked all the way up
03yeah, I have to have the 3D *off*
halfway to about three quarters of the way up is fine
03so it's basically a waste of a console
1212drf, the 3DS isn't only about 3D :P
1212and yeah AE
don't know and to be honest don't care
1212that would be like saying the wii is only about that remote derp
03you mean it's not?

03the Wii is essentially a GameCube with wireless remotes...
1212XD
sure seems that way
not really
more about the gimmicks
03^
1212That’s an opinion
1212:P
its not an opinion
its the truth
they have been all about gimmicks since the release of the DS
12[16:42] <nickstr> not really
pretty much
03Since the release of the DS
03Originally they were good
03but since maybe 2007
03they've kinda sucked
1212people don't really buy those just for the content though
1212Nintendo would go under if they didn't have good content.
03junh1024-XD she's at work
03why
because their systems suck
03<NightSeas> people don't really buy those just for the content though <- ahem, Halo
the Wii was outdated as soon as it was released
same with the
Gameboy Color
03orly?

03you could run a still image on both and it'll look the same

1212they have it for both PSP and 3DS

1212they were both 480p

03it's still 720x480
03your TV just stretches it./

/me vomits
Sticking with the PS1 games and/or a random PS2 one
LOL
:D
I have hunger.
03really, *any* DRM is awful
brb
03inb4 people misspelling my initials for DRM >_>
DRF, the worst DRM
03LOL.
Is when you gotta have a disk in the drive
:D
03the only acceptable DRM is that which can be easily removed
02I've got tLoS tEN on my DS and I hate it
03like iTunes
03I can just strip the DRM right off
02because I can't beat Terrador
But, I'm on a laptop
03HML
03No isntalling
:<
03You just pop the CD in
03and it starts
03:D
02sounds good
02but
02baseball?
03it's actually really fun
03trust me XD
02O.o
03there's a backyard soccer too but I hated that
02o...k?
03mainly because soccer is too chaotic
02eh
03baseball, at least you're only playing one person at a time
03at least when you're at bat
03and not trying to control an entire team
02I like soccer irl
03they later made like, a Backyard Basketball and some other spinoffs
02but sports games on consoles? forget it.
03There's a Backyard Baseball 2003, I didn't like it
03not console
02k
03really?
03GBA, PS2, even iOS?
02Is there an appropriate umbrella term I can use?
03http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backyard_Baseball
03the 1997 one is the one I'm referring to
02stupid thing automatically opens links in IE
02:I
02I should change that
02IE sucks
03I actually sorta want a Chromebook
Haha
Well,
ChromeOS/Chromium OS
Runs on a regular laptop
;D
uh
Bad idea
03why
I tried the VM version
and
No support
for anything
03ethernet doesn't work I'm guessing?
like, mouse + drivers
03wtf?
Not exactly
hey guys, how can i msg from irc client into #bronystate?
03did you use VMWare or VBox
Both
I think
But
03LOL
03well
03because my laptop currently has no hard drive
03:/
yeah
I did that actually
LOL
03where do you download it? :P
03hard drive broke
and I believe you can run it natively
03hence why it has no hard drive
again>
03yes
Ouch
03remembe rI said
Without installing
037200RPM is a trap
03in laptops
http://chromeos.hexxeh.net/
03because at that high of a speed, even the slightest movement can damage it
03:/
03which I USUALLY do
http://chromeos.hexxeh.net/download.php?track=vanilla&build=2149.0.2012_04_16_1651-r3602abe2&type=usb

it evens out the grid and doesnt include this room
03TigerDirect.com
03How about no

might as well be the mods
03sigh
03my sister just gave up on trying to get the mouse to work

Yeah lmao
03since I'm gonna need the LARA console again
03at elast
03*least
03so I can just dump this onto that
/me hides
03it's only like a 400MB ISO
lmao
03and it uses uh
03ISOLINUX
03to load
03so I can easily just use unetbootin
they left it plugged in?
03yep.
/me facepalms
03that has drivers
03THE WRONG DRIVERS TOO MIGHT I AD
>floppy
03*ADD
what
yeah
03due to the RAID controller?
03yeah
yeah I saw
03they're like
03"We connected them"
lmao
03it had the WRONG F'ING DRIVERS
FLOPPY
03so I had to go find them mysel
03f
/me snaps the floppy and flops it around
03I'm a bit mad still
03but whatever
._.
still, hetzner's uptime is quite awesome
uhh my head -_-
probably is
03it SHOULD "just work" with the RAID controller?
03and not neeed drivers?
03-e
should
or doesn't
03XD
other http://www.linux-drivers.org/
otherwise
03I've had more experience with it not workin
03g
if it doesn't have it installed already
derp
03uh
03search for 3ware? I'm lazy
/me runs
more like i think i'm getting sick
lmao
you should get some juice and crackers and rest then, instead of being on a computer
03Ascendant I am an idiot
03I thought I'd reboot it to see if it went any faster
03Nope.
03Not at all.
._.
03I guess that's the one downside to vSphere
it shouldn't be taking that long to boot
03is stupidly long reboot times
03I learned that from work
03when I accidentally unplugged it
03it took like half an hour to come back online

Well
03the whole idea to vSphere
then watch some ponies :3
03is that you leave the physical machine running
03and just reboot the VMs as needed
03so yeah
03but when I bumped the power cord
03and had to restart it
03so we just gotta hope Hetzner doesn't lose power

My story is too much for me to explain atm.
04Well, explain it when you can.
okaaayyyy
04And maybe we can help comfort you.
6um
6if a girl is causing you to be this rage-y
6no offense man
6but that's not healthy
i might just write a document in note pad, dropbox it and link it in here.

02I swear I didn't do it
Do that please
actually

screw posting it in here

6dude you need to

6relax
6a bit
6stress literally isn't healthy, and drives people /away/
I'm trying.
well its driven my gf away...again
6what did you do?
apparently i was taking a little joke "too far". when i was clearly just playing around.
she didnt tell me to stop.
6well
yeah.
thats how i saw it
6but one thing that relationships seem to dwell on a lot is what's "offensive"
i can barely go a day w/o being in tears.
EVEN ON THE DAY OF MY SHOWS I CANT GO W/O CRYING.
04"You're and @$$" may be totally acceptable, but on the other hand "I don't like those shoes" may turn her into an eldritch horror.
she throws a fit for that too.
6um
;-;
6wait how old are you?
18 why?
-.-
`-`
6just wondering
sigh.
6cuz you're making it sound like you're not getting anyhting positive out of the relation.
6I see people root themselves into relationships and they suffer for it, I don't know why they stay
6so as long as you find something to hold onto
6it's worth it if you deem it worthy
6but you need to measure that against how miserable you are in the bad times
04Why am I giving relationship advice when I've never had a girlfriend
/me shuts up now.
6lol
02Relationship in a friend way possibly?
well i'm not in a PROPER relationshop
...
relationship*
I'm in a LD ne.
one*
6if it's not a proper relationship
04It's weird.
6unless you can see yourself marrying said person
6think it through before causing more grief
SIGH
6it's not always the best
6but I do advise you take a look at where you are right now
12Shiny~
6and decide what's worth it and what's not.
6if you are depressed that often...
02Sorry I can't stay and draw on anyone else's heads, but I have to sleep
6night
ow my ribs are hurting alot ;_;
/me hugs
12Nick alert
12XD
6<SilverSonic>	i can barely go a day w/o being in tears. <-this in particular has me worried
/me removes Night from nick alert
I can't....let...her...go... ;_;
I've been with her for over a year ;_;
6um
.,.
6that right there is the most dangerous and destructive thing I've heard a person say
i know ;_;
If i did let her go...well...she'd kill herself ;_;
6..
she nearly attempted it.
04...
04I have no words.
6then have a psychologist when you do it
12wait
i dont want to ruin her trust ;_;
6are you content marrying her?
6or worse, having her think she'll marry you and then you say no?
12O_O
12O_o*
6SS, does her parents know she's semi-suicidal?
bwaaaaaaa
6then let them know
actually wait
12ah
6if anything, talk to them first
i misread that as my parents
6dad?
12why does she make you cry?
she lives in WA
6ok well
GL: long story.
6that makes it somewhat harder
6but the fact remains that you're basically chained to a person and you don't seem to have a say in anything
^pretty much
04^Seconded
12v downed
is she really worth the effort? think about that long and hard
/me runs
sigh
this is too overwhelming atm ;-;
6I'm only trying to help
04:/
12and why does he want to leave her?
i dont want to leave her.
if i did she'd kill herself GL.
sigh
12then why are you upset? derp
6allow yourself to remain in a suffering position, or free yourself and perhaps it wont be as bad as you think
/me lazy
dude...
04And stop yelling at people trying to help.
6drake
i was yelling at GL.
6that was NS's fault
6not SS's
04Ok
6nightseas...
NS, that was very insensitive of you to say that
that aside
6I think it's been pointed out to you several times, you don't really think
6yeah
6when you see a conversation going
6try reading first
6repeating oneself is rather annoying, especially when something like this is being discussed
12like I said, lazy :'D
04...
6then no sh*t, get out of the conversation
/me sighs
this shouldn't really be in #silverwings in the first place
6it's one thing to be in a conversation, but if you're going to help, you can't really be lazy
04I honestly don't have anything to say that accurately portrays my sheer disbelief at such callousness.
6...again, things evolved into silverwings once again
its all my fault.
i brought this crap into SW
6the whole moving channels thing seems to be rather difficult, it's never happened once lol
6no its not
12Aurora, I was joking. I'm already reading up
you need help, we're here
NS it isn't a joke at all
yes... everyone needs a venting every once in awhile
6right
12about being lazy
6NS, remember when you made me rather pissed off?
6thats where i'll leave it
6anyways
12derp
that's actually the best thing you can do
as a starting point to solve this whole thing
/me nods
keeping things inside
never works out very well
6^
6it eases tension to tell people, even more tension when people are able to help
i've kept my feelings bottled up for months.
i've tried VERY HARD
to keep it hidden on my show
04You need to talk to people.
then you probably have a lot to deflate then
6you might need a night to do that
sadly :/
yeah, a seperate channel would be best
but again
i don't feel qualified to talk about relationships
we're here for you
but i'll be here if you need me
I'll prove that right now
there, now he won't be going anywhere.

LOL PHP
at least you're not doing assembly yet
LOL HTML
03oh hm
that all?
yo
03my computer has 8GB of RAM
then have the program output a sum of both those numbers
03and
yah
using all 3 of those languages
03VSphere says it recommends 8168MB
03for the VM
in one sitting
03how much smaller is that
03thyan 8GB
uh
03@calc 8*1024
= 8192
8GB is 8192
03@calc 8192-8162
= 30
03er
03yeah
03@calc 8192-8168
= 24
03that's not bad at all
0324MB of RAM

bash scripts we went through in a day

we went through perl in a day

yes
bash scripting is easy
perl is fairly okay apparently
03well
03now I need to figure out
03how the frick to install an OS
that's not easy
03it has this weird datastore thing
03I can't just toss it an ISO
03I don't think anyway

and it's not even in minimal english either
like python or perl

huh
03oh wait
03I can upload the ISO to it

03no but seriously
03about how much would you want

I'll go with 20GB at least

03OK
up to you
0325?
I don't really mind
03that's probably easiest
sure
03alright
though
just saying
03then I'd get around 460-470 for me
03eh
03well
03if I give you 512MB of RAM
03then that's 512MB of swap ;P
that's 512mb of swap

Trixie: Looks at you; shuffles.

O_o Brock is in Saturn's programming team
Rainbow: Not here.
Back
And thank you
/me throws a cinderblock at cow334's face.
Saturn's motes are DEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAD
/me takes away Meanwhile's cinderblock
08,01the field motes don't need to be able to see the sink mote direclty; they just need a path to it through active motes
I thought I got rid of these
(pursing)
Rainbow: I mean not here. As in absent. As in in a location that is somewhere other than this one.

03it basically requires you to spend money on basic functionality
Aw, why u no stay on Rarity pic! D:

04It's just a way to curb resales and get more money
yep
12pretty much
I thought Spike was holding a pack of ciagarettes
that's an adorable picture. and hello, everypony!
12but I still like it
Its the onion, its just silly
12so no problems
I thot it was a pack of cigs in Spikes hand at first :o but then i came to my senses :P
I have located the complete United States CFR or code of federal regulations
(O )_____(o) wy would yall think that
03I'm fine paying for *good* games, but I absolutely refuse to buy crap with DRM
including CFR 47 which is the FCC portion
Humans would be freaking giants in equestria then O_o
everyone doing good today?
every hour
at the very least
05y
03I think it's more often for ours
03as the shows are only an hour long
that is called the top of hour legal ID
or remember getting cut
05Biglaw: its the angle
Aww....:D
03not sure if it's different for a low-power station
Its just...so...D'aww
Well, actuall, it was...5 years ago, my bad.
I operate under CFR 47 part 97 and there are reduced ID times for that
every ten minutes
03yeah that's probably right
part 97 by the way is amateur radio
03I was thinking every 10 or 20
2that's up to you if you want to take the risk of pirating things
03"risk"
03just don't be an idiot and you'll be fine
03so yeah, I can understand why you're scared
/me hides
05asskisser.
2hm? I'm just as bad as you when it comes to that XD
05i dont take requests, besides i dont feel liek rammstein atm
*test
Well, I was able to stop listening to This Day Aria....because I got this stuck in my head ALL DAY LONG http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29-q7YnyUmY
2but I'd never ask someone eles to
03well
2else*
03Case in point, Ubisoft

03they make you buy stupid plastic figurines to unlock features
03>_>
I had to shave this off. I cannot wait for my beard to grow back right and proper.
12...
12doood
13These "stupid plastic figurines" also happen to be collectibles to some people, deal with it :P
ha

03I don't WANT to play it because >DRM
03I've said this ehough

Oh....
03"You can't even play single player if you're disconnected from our servers for 'anti piracy reasons'"
03OK finme
03well
03their servers die for a day
12> Not mine
03that YOU PAID FOR
03because THEIR servers died
03Greatest idea ever, right?
12whut
12LOL
03But if you just pirated the games, no problems.
I noticed Dr.Whoove getting attacked by the changlings in the episode. I thought he was goign to bust out the screwdriver and kill them :D.
03because everybody complained about THEIR stupid policies
03:P
Kinda, it's the nerdy feeling it gives that i like
12this isn't ubisoft though
03It still makes me laugh how idiotic they ewre being
03*were
12Meh
12;3
03they didn't want to loan me the figures because "they're collectibles"
Well usually he doesn't
03that means I can't play the stupid thing
12Nope
Aww yeah, this song!:)
*opionion
12to the end
Well...... see ya later.
03without having any of the figures?
12if you want to 100% collect the smaller items
12then you have to get the figures
:O
12and its 5 more
i dont trust you with her.
This day aria gives me chilles EVERY time i hear it
Hm, not sure i like those pony faces, they're cool but i like my normal faces too :-O
Yup
05guess 3 times
03> they didn't want to loan me the figures because "they're collectibles"
03> that means I can't play the stupid thing
12You buy, they come with and such

Any movies/series planned for tonight ? (or whatever time of fay it is for you) ?
BLAKKA BLAKKA
03that's my problem with it.
Once you get out of high school people are still just as stupid.
03They're effectively saying "pay us lots of money or gtfo"
But they don't take it out on others.
12your best bet is to try it at a friends
03because if I Can't just rent the stupid thing
03then no
hey
12I don't really care
I live
i hunger

04Honestly, if I played Skylanders I'd probably like

06hahahahahaha
06sorry but
You're*

I find you equating physical objects to DRM to be tenuous at best
that's weird, I've got nothing on LimeV
03it IS though
aha
13[18:30] [@ValtheJean] alright everyone, give me some time to set up
O_o How in the world did I sleep for 2.5 hours?
I bet he's from Georgia
03It would be one thing if they were just collectable and didn't actually affect the agme in any way
12> can't talk about something you'd like to talk about with others if majority of people dislike it
04drf, Skylanders is different to other games by the use of figures.

they can't normalize

you should
but they can compress
IN SPAAAAAAAAACE
just listen to the air monitor if you have any doubts
