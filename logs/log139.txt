Everyone wears skates? Put in stairs.
Rollerblade bakers are best bakers.

forty cakes? That's like four times ten cakes! That's terrible!
(I'm not watching btw)
what's our best movie?
Can I have my gun back now Luna? PLZ
my vote is for DS2
Spiders Web was beyond horrendous. It is unspeakable.
they are doing both
This film didn't beat my spider situation Luna why didn't it?!
04MLP wasn't that bad
04But THIS
2,14 dude, DS2 was awesome
06,15THPS is our best movie, of course....
I don't know how to riff this
07,1RHPS!
THPS?
>(hard I might add)
06,15RHPS, I mean
DS2?
/me hugs both the luna's

04DS2 was a good film
07,1this is a ZZZZZ movie
DS2 was amazing
But I won;t say

Damn it!
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH
The worst klind of thief.
Rotten tomamtoes gave it a 48%
*kind
I couldn't riff Se7en. I had to watch it full screen.

It's the complete oppisite of this movie.
Se7en was great, though.

07,1ThePretender not yet

is there a list of all the movies we've seen somewhere?
04Oh...

10Haters be hating. I liked across the universe.
04"That" film
Eddie Izzard was the best bit.
Ahh, the other Beatles movie.
06,15lawl
economy that runs on sweets...
you guys say 34 but I say rule 34D
We need to see The Wall.
/me refuses to talk about "that" film
why
If we're going to watch movies based on bands.
If i won the lottery we'd be watching footage of blenders.
lol
why has nopony picked Dogma yet?
This movie if full of larded scenes.
04But I like the idea of a Mel Brooks night
07,1we need to see LABYRINTH
We need to watch Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
I'd rather watch an actual wall now.
Across the Universe was the best musical we watched.
yeah
Yes Luna
Dogma ftw
heck yeah
Luna,Hell yea
Nittany_Dischord I am all for that idea!
Or someone could megatroll and suggest Never Say Never.
History of the World
don't forget that
Never Say Never... Again? Hey I'm down with that.
Wait, there money is also lisences?
and Producers
toyland has suddenly become dystopian
If i win the a movie I'd pick Screamers (1995)
because brooks did that too
Luna sheds a single tear.
Bring Keanu back in his leather coat and shades.
and naked gun
07,1so this movie is 2 cd's

I sense an underlying political statement.
OBJECTION
Beatles songs helped it.
Let's gooooooooooooooooo
/me skips to the gun store.
this movie is an elaborate metaphor for the holocaust
Keanu Reeves took 40 cakes!
OBJECTION!
This is a very political movie.

Is the stream on? I can't see anything
07,1without a gun?
:/
you're not missing anything important
can we just cut back to the girl in a coma?
Horror movie directors should watch this. It'll teach them how to make something that's actually terrifying.
I still say use the soundboard, make an exception just this once :P
this a remake?
Its more likely the you think
ginerbrony666 switch to low quality if you cant see anything
it wouldn't be
/me realises his jetpack is hammerproof
It would be 20% cooler.

At least this song is tollerable
I hope if I ever have a concussion-induced hallucination where I create a fantasy world

Wat the...?
aUGH! Brain in pain! Make it end!
>this is all a dream
>this wedding doesn't actually happen
>this movie blows
This is all a story made up by Lisa while she is in the ER in the real world.Because she never felt like a kid she made up this story to feel like a kid once b4 she dies irl from brain damage.

I guess I missed something besides the episodes and the movies
I'm scared, guys
hi how do i use another irc client for this
Someone hold me...
T^T!!!!!
oh gosh oh gosh..
Oh, that story is not sc- YAHHHHHHH!!!!
I wan't to hear the full story :/
inb4 cannabalism
rarity and applejack are totally avoiding their feelings for each other
suddenly, cannibalism
Canibalism!!
but then that's no fun
One flag.
Confirmed: Rarity is OCD
/me page refreshed and cant read old posts
hi natelyn
Welcome back everypony that left because of the movie that caused widespread depression!
the tale of BABES IN TOYLAND!
Ya just eat em
04Yes, Spider's Web over Babes in Toyland. At least with Spider's Web I laughed
eeehaa, Just eat em!
Rarity is NOT OCD
2PM EST
Rarity is good with Marshmallows
Pardon.
with Babes in Toyland we just cried
OCD is totally different
04I *NEVER* laughed at Babes in Toyland
I cried a few times.
Anyone getting the audio derpy?
you know we never did see a single babe in toyland
/me hands out smores to everyone!
being careful and neat is not OCD, neither is not like getting dirty
http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2011/223/7/0/cannibal_lolocaust_by_pixelkitties-d466hh1.png
2,14 I laughed...uncomfortably....you know, the kind where you laugh because the only other option is cry hysterically
twilight's clueface
/me blends his smore.
I mean, I only came a few minutes at the end, and I felt it was too long
I killed myself 3 times I think during that movie.
Yay~
granted they can be manifest in OCD sufferers
S0pider's web is the one with the pig lying right?
04Web is "So bad it's good." Babes was "So bad it's deadly"
:)
"I know! Jail break! YAAAAAAAAY"
ME!?
Oh, my bad. Re: Dirt - Mysophobia, then. :P
Deadly like me T^T
Luna, are you guys streamming tomorrows episode?
>Pony Thread Simulator 3
Timmy Turner and Da Rules
There's another one?
Does this look like an iPhone herospirit?
AHAHAHAHAAHAH
Oh noes! I disconnected! I missed part of an episoded I've only seen forty times!
It depressed me too.
:D
Where did she find that?
Hawt
lol
Applejack's huh huh huh laugh

lol
drunklestia yes there is. and it's just as scarring
Like, it really did.

Cannon!
/me chucks a pillow at everyone!
wanted to do it
most epic pillow fight ever
This is the pillow fight to end all pillow fights!
/me hugs everyone
INCOMING! GET DOWN!
Pillow "fight"? Still looks more like pillow warfare to me
BOOM HEADSHOT
TWILIGHT NO!!
/me then its eveeryone with pillows
2,14 please refrain from things like that
pew
TWILIGHT'S DOWN]
pew pew
/me blends a pillow
Pony Down!!!!
neck dodge
*Smacks EVERYONE!*
/me hits Luna with a pillow
Is tomorrow's episode going to be streamed?
Submarine Twilight!
gentlemen
Twilight caught in the crossfire.
Twilight with pillow on head is best Twilight.
Fu- *WHAP*
>pillowhead
oof
and, arguably, in episode 25
<3
Where did Applejack's hat go? D:
2,14 I was refering to zach's image
I'm also ill. I get really depressed when I'm sick. Sometimes I know I'm going to get sick because of the depression. And then that horrible, horrible movie....
time for a reverse striptease, everypony
YES
rohirrim probably a hat rack
Like this
/me charges at Thunder_Dash with a pillow
YESSSSSSSSSSSS
snuggly
clopclopclopclop
do not fap to ponies!
also, Rarity has OCD
Eeeyah
CAN'T HEAR YA, AH'M ASLEEP
Yes. I understand. I sincerely apologize.
I do not belive in hat racks.
yeah?
dat honesty
Clop
/me charges everypony with a pillow
CHUU.
aaaashew
shoo
why does this fandom need to make me constantly see shipping in EVERYTHING now?
2,14 it's alright, just keep it in mind next time ;)
NOT
supprised they did't rip that blanket in half.
lol
Twilight spoke, and they were silenced
Why does Applejack look naked without her hat?
wait...
Wait, did anyone count how many times Twilight said fun?
The book knows all
I should sleep, but I'm going to be depressed if I don't have ponies to cheer me up.
that sounded wrong
Fun... fun... fun... fun...
She just have to say that
yep
Because she is nake dwithout her hat
Well, I alwayas am :P
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG
aww, she's cute in bad
bad.
I think I'm going to sleep.
Lights on
OOOAAAHH T^T
Wait.
but I can't decide
...that's not a loose branch
Suddenly rainstorm
I agree, happypony
bad idea
inb4 CoD reference
GENIUS
Should I?
GENIOUS
applefail
treeception?
thats not a branch applejack
Treeception!
TREECEPTION!
and now twilight loses it lol
*BRRRRRRRRMMMMMMM*
HAH! Beat you to it
Yo dawg, I herd u liek trees.
LOOK IN THE BOOK
Fine
i dont get where thecod4 reference was
A Leaf/branch/tree turducken.
*AJ shifty eyes*
and, as much as it shames me to admit it as a Rarity fanboy
Applejack is the bigger pony here
Please, I got the book, and the first page says: PAGES
Thunder_Dash: That just means it was a good night. :3
first: where's her hat?
She is looking in the "B"s
it... blew off?!
I wish
yea
I am now that that mvoei is over
I know i am
but I thought the staples would stop
that's how bad it rattled me
I am
It'll be okay
THAT WAS THE DOOSY!
Babes in toyland was a F-Movie
You need some shoo be doo recovery
I missed the lottery, what's the next set of movies?
I kinda wish we just had 2 A movies
Incredibles and Yellow Submarine
it was a -Z movie
Incredibles is good.
makes a minimal amount of sense
seeing as how it was a rainstorm
and if my suspicions are correct
Incredibles is pretty awesome.
I don't know but it is epic.
Yeah.
Yellow Submarine, Incredibles
there's a special event?
still dont get the cod4 reference
Rarity. How did you get that dirty
Never mind Lord.
?
Yellow Submarine is also hard to sit through.
okay
How has no one heard of the Yellow Submarine?
Awwwwwhh
silly Twilight
no
Not in the book = mass confusion
Where did that come from...REALLY?
no
except perhaps inception
Do ghostbusters count as an A movie?
but everyone's heard of Babes
what's DS2?
YES
How has no one herad of Yellow Submarine?
in during twilight being a huge aspie
deathstalker TOO
I've heard OF it
I haven't
epic faces
wasn't yellow submarine a cartoon?
Hi everybody!
>ass
nah
wow...
a really really trippy cartoon?
Epic guesses.
Ghostbusters is a AAAA
That depends, the beatles?
I still say that our B-Movie sometime NEEDS to be "Nudist Colony of the Dead"
yes the Beatles Movie
I'm only familliar with the song.
Pain in the Patootie
>argue with each other over who's more annoying
or Hot Fuzz
WE ALL LIVE IN A YELLOW SUBMARINE, YELLOW SUBMARINE, YELLOW SUBMARINE.
What's NCotD?
Hot Fuzz? Make it happen.
nope.zvi
AAAHH SHE SAID FUN AGAIN
:)
Bring on Alien damnit.
Pillow Hat is best hat.
considering the way twilight's books are treated
A Serbian Movie, I think not
they must have a GOOD printing press in Equestria
AJ's left and Rarity's left were the same left...
Hot Fuzz would be a great movie to show here.
And a quite profitable one.
*wap*
CAUGHT BY THE FUZZ, WHILE I was-STILL ON THE FUZZ
A Serian Movie is probably illegal in most countries anyway.
Aw no more...
I wasn't suggesting it ;_;
night
Wait
seriously, seeing that thing once was enough for me
te "yeah" reminds me of the WACKY INFLATABLE ARM FLAILING INFLATEABLE TUBEMEN
I was just saying that no
2,14 oh I needed that cheer up :P
aww, no more requests
Night everyone

Night everypony.

This does not seem promising.
Night Mean
something worse than G3.5
wtf?
THESE ARE THE WRONG TINY HORSES
Meanwhile*

THESE ARE NEITHER PASTEL, MAGICAL OR CUTE
Uhh....WTF is this?!?!
wtf is this?
good news this has a song too.
I dont think it is from Equestria...
please tell me one of these breaks its neck
yes, yes he did
"heavier than the rest of us, she has massive body image issues"
noooooooooooooooo! you b*****
But it is bad all the same.
SNAP
problem? :D
.....
luna still
the animation sucks
/me mutes the stream
"I'm not ready?" Rarity?
Well this Draconequus needs rest, see everypony in 8 hours
LET'S ALL MOCK OUR FRIENDS

I keep thinking this'll take a bad turn somewhere
I SEE A CAT! I SEE A RAT! I SEE A MAN WIV A BASEBALL BAT!
WTH
WTF
I CAN SEE A LADDER LEANING ON A LOG
I've no idea.
Anyone know wtf this is?
Well if the stream magically explodes, I can just watch the episode recording on my DirecTV. :3
Damn morbid curiosity...

I don't like this very much...
but this is much, much worse
MY BRAIN! IT IS MELTING!
come on guys let's GET CREATIVE
It's the Sea Ponies shell!
=/
> mfw dat laugh
GGgale you barely made it
I'm going to go out on a limb and say "British".
I would be ashamed to be caught watching this
don't be cross with us
This is the kind of thing that having opposable thumbs would really help with.
fuck you
or useful mouths
or horns
with happiness
hes going to mount you
is their a request section?
lol
should be #vinyl_scratch
yes, yes you are different
Accents?
YES!
^
yes, it was
Ponez?
lol
but it was still bad
Ponez!!
Pinkie and the Brain.
This is brilliant!
:D
WINWINWINWINWINWINWINWINWINWINWINWINWIN!!!!!!!!
*breathes in relief*
this is win
I'm out for now guys, won't be able to catch ep 2 with you guys (catching it at BroNYCon)

TWILIGHT
Brain Brain Brain Brain Brain Brain
byyye!

That was beautiful.
Hey, it's this again.

I like where this is going.

thankee
More songs? :D
that's some impressive redstone
The time has come to welcome spring, and all things warm and green~!
this is win
didn't we watch all of these earlier?
agreed :3
Haha, coincidence much?
Wow.
how serendipitous
WINTER WRAP UP
this must have taken a week, at least
Cus tomorrow spring is here!
Winter wrap up!
So...how many hourse do you think it took to make this?
some of the notes are slightly off but there's no helping it
at least, yeah
It got a bit lazy in the later part. beats are off a tiny bit.
quite a few
over 9000
it could have been made by a program
except he transcribed it by ear
oh, okay then
Win
I've seen that
Mineception
lol
lolwut
mineception?
I'm going to guess this took a LOT of work.
how's that work
ya i saw that
Using redstone he made a computer that could play it
Ha! :D :D
Clop clop clop clop clop!
clapclapclap
:D
This is awesome
I can't believe I didn't realize it was him
found it
popout*
I thought about using the popout, but this just feels right.
This was my song when I was like 15.
2,14 fillies and gentlecolts
2,14 that is all
like we haven't already been doing that
/me glomps Luna again
luna still here?
I am not sure, but I do have a copy of the album this is from right next to me, and I can check if you'd like?
oh I DO, trixie, I do
All ready for epp 2 tomorrow?
#vinyl_scratch
He did.
alrighty then
/me laughs at lightirc
It would appear that is is "Polkarama"
I just realized how dirty these lyrics are
the popularity of certain characters seem to be a direct inverse of their screen time
now I ain't saying she's a goooold digger
No problem! ;)
haha censoring
much classier
oh boy
yeah^
I think if a pony showed up for ONE frame with a distinguishing feature, the fans would be making 34 of her before the episode was over
YES
I guess
/me prepares his tissues
aaaaaaah
I dont know where this is going, but I think I like it
she still aint messing with no broke *****s
oh nvm
i have
i haven't
Okay. I just switched to French... for some reason.

why?
I used to live in France when I was a kid.
*eee* :p
I was that for about three weeks, then suddenly LAWL I'm headed to toys 'r us
I prefer to just keep my bronyism to myself
yes
"Are You Proud to be a Brony"
song name
other than when i watch it with my little sister at my house
NSFW language, watchout
It happens occaisionally. Though I can't help it.
Oh, and loving the pony emoticons, whomever implemented these.
I'm planning on being more open about my bronyness once I've got napowrimo done.
"live it down"
as if it's something to live down
I don't even speak it fluently anymore though.
This song?
Yeah
Yeah, it's "Proud to be a Brony"
Excellent, thank you! :D
You're welcome! ;)
