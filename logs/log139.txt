2,14 needless to say, it will not happen again
Why doesn't Batman just wear a Gasmask?
lol
wow. He just woke up for the first time in days, and now he's off to save the city again.
07,1Lottery / excuses / anything else?
I mean in real life
cuz, then he would have worse throat cancer
because he's batman
07,1and of course the youtube vid
04Yep
did you lose one?
Illegal? or Awesome?
U MAD?
like a baa-a-aa-at?
YOu can't fire god
04Fired?
Because he can hold his breath reeeeeeally long
04Go work for Bruce
problem?
D'aww.
ujelly
Fire? Morgan Freeman?
You can't fire God
Morgan Freeman's gonna have to choke a bitch
we phased out memos years ago
HA
You can't fire Morgan Freeman
didn't you get the memo?
scaaaaarecrow
Bruce Wayna should like…buy the company :P
I *would* like to announce the DA competition, but me and Octy need to get the finer details worked out now that the poll has been opened
in soviet russia, god fire YOU.
batman doesn't rebreathe. rebreathers batman!
04You can't fucking fire Morgan Freeman
no not morgan freeman how could you
Wayne*
he just fired batman arms dealer
Morgan Freeman owns your ass
04Morgan Freeman is GOD
sounds like a good idea...
^
Morgan Freeman can work for The Electric Company
Ya well thats the mob for you
If you fire Morgan Freeman, you're firing yourself
07,1Alright, anything else?
That's okay, Morgan Freeman is being re-hired as the president.
It's a jungian archetype
MORGAN BUCKING FREEMAN cannot be fired.
scarecrow
played by Cillian Murphy
Morgan freeman will go back to his job as god
07,1Who picked the B movie?
or he can go become nelson mandela
07,1tis horrible...
04If Morgan agrees with you, much less WORKS for you, you best damn bow down for a full day to have one of the greatest actors in the history of mankind working with you and for you
07,1>.<
Morgan Freeman gets fired, goes through a low point as Miss Daisy's driver
2,14 don't know
Or a prisoner at Shawshank
gets rehired, becomes god
07,1it was'nt a movie for starters..
finds mexico.
Ghosties: Amen.
07,1it was a tv series
Or as a civil war soilder
settles down and retires to be president of some african country
still more intelligent about mental illness than Sucker Punch
His low point isn't prison?
;x
apparently there are like, 3 versions'
DRUG TIME!

Batman-related trivia: Bruce Wayne doesn't drink alcohol, in social gatherings, he drinks apple juice.
TOO SOON: I was thinking that if Troy Davis had an outrageous moustache, he wouldn't have gotten framed/would obviously be the killer. Troy Davis has no remarkable features outside of being black.
Jedi mind tricks
O:
He's the bad guy
That's like, Black Pony thick plot

It's 2006 and I'm excited about the Idea
Goes off to do homework.... Feels bad man
04I'm sure people wouldn't be happy, Tovler
07,1btw.. about the lottery if someone picks s2ep1 do we allow it?
Hopefully, they do Bane right and make him a super-genius

Is this music from Simcity?
Kenny G?

Turn the radiator on.
I'll see what I can find. Thanks valthejean
Was that loud blast of sound intentional?
silent Thata's a good B movie, but I hope it's the "Recobbled" cut.
RobotPinkie: By letting kids do all the dangerous work? :P
Val why don't you have a woman make it for you
FreezeFrame: they already showed it once

Need more booze
LT'S ALL GO TO THE LOBBY,LET'S ALL GO TO THE LOBBY,LET'S ALL GO TO THE LOBBY AND GET ORSELVES A SNACK!

I actually hate when this friend of mine raid leads.
Mr. Streamer, was that loud blast of sound intentional?
half the chat gouged their eyes out as a result, FF.
wielding*
Val said it was Civ 3 Dashite
06,15A pony is not a baby horse, or something...
/me starts to slowly rock her head.

O: Dinky!
mhpf....4AM already >.<
^_^
07,1alright ready for intermission announcements?
06,15Well, true, but they ARE the elements of harmony, SuperBrony64 :P
Imean :O
the mane 6 are adults, half of them run businesses
pls amddude, i'd skip all my homework if it meant missing ponies
B movie should be Barney's Bit adventure
or something
SuperBrony64: they are young adults to avoid things like school
I might miss it since dinner is about to be ready
So they are 17~22
6 min 40 sec left of intermission
I peg 'em around that range, too.
lottery? uhoh my mind is full of only pony right now! V_V
something really childish and crazy
06,15Celestia doesn't have the power to stop Discord, for example.
RobotPinkie: Which they don't have at the moment :P
mane 6 ages lol, I peg them at around 18-20
ready when you are, I have my sandwich

LUNA BETTER BE IN EP 2
/me is READY

/me 's body is ready
SuperBrony64: That may come up.
06,15I think they're about brony age, all of them!

This is all a dream she's having while freezing to death.
Cookie communism.

its food or currency, not both
I would rather swim through a mile of smooze than watch this
edible currnecy sounds a bad idea
04Was Shosties
Goodbye movie, see you in Hell!!
inb4 the Cookie bubble bursts
lol cookie communism
Smooze and flutterponies would've been improved with a blender.
so the cookie factory is like a bank?
Cookie no money, cookie FOOD.
NOM NOM NOM
cookie currency? Pinkie is a millionaire
Pssh…you need to be 21 even in Toyland for doing stuff...
At least smooze was interesting
cookies for communists!
This makes G1 ponies look like amazing cartoon
All the black people died from diabetes

/me begins to shoot herself.
oh shi- Is that Keanu?

Flutterpony musk defeats smooze, though.
>mfw I realized this was filmed in a shitty amusement park named toyland
300 YEARS OLD!!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAJSZsZYnrE&feature=related
it's the only explanation
/me takes the gun away from LunaTheForgotten
so,toyland proper is just the apple family barn?
2,14 no links please
this in a town where Insulin is like gold, thanks to a cookie based economy
/me sends Barnabe Barncale to the MOOOOOOOON
So luna, how many cheesecakes must i make for you to end this?
I told you, shoot the movie, not yourself!
Everyone wears skates? Put in stairs.
Rollerblade bakers are best bakers.
problem solved
ValtheJean, mybad
LunaTheForgotten don't do it yet, you have to endure so you can say you've witnessed the worse
oh hey, why is the Toyland economy like the real world's economy?
WHY Luna! WHY must it go on..
Do you like mmmmblenders
lol
because both seem to crumble rather easily

THIS WILL MAKE US STRONGER
RobotPinkie - same here
time to spike the cookies
Not even keebler elves made this movie better
I want to go into a mint now and yell "money break!"
/me still hasn't seen a single Babe in toyland
I love when I come in like at a random time and have no idea what is going on
"wanna Cookie" has a whole new meaning
And now he shits on the cookies ..... like a BAWS?
From now on Intermission will be called Cookie Break.
and then they stole forty cakes
04Folks, I think this may be a contender for worst film ever in Brony State
See what happens.
actually, this movie WOuLD be better with Pinkie Pie
/me slowly losing his English class and sanity.
His evil plan involves them all getting diabeetus.
Oh yeah, listen to the obvious evil man...
if we can endure this, then 4chan has no chance of stopping us
ghosties it's easily up there
07,1yep I think so too
Ghosties,I agree
cookie embezzlement
No the pig movie has this beat hands down
this is BFE levels of unwatchable
07,1this beats spider's web!
Ghosties: MLP?
06,15Haha, true...
I get in from a night drinking to this...
Oh hell no.
forty cakes? That's like four times ten cakes! That's terrible!
(I'm not watching btw)
So are they robbing the place or staving the people?
what's our best movie?
Can I have my gun back now Luna? PLZ
my vote is for DS2
Spiders Web was beyond horrendous. It is unspeakable.
Ultimate Drinking Game: While watching Babes in Toyland, take a shot every time something stupid happens.
huhuh... what?
they are doing both
This film didn't beat my spider situation Luna why didn't it?!
followed by True Romance
>Carefully sets cake in box
Man that guy owns and hitting cake with a stick
04MLP wasn't that bad
Oh good, everyone leaves so they can steal. The villain declaring a lunch break is very unsupicious.
04But THIS
2,14 dude, DS2 was awesome
>Drops Box
06,15THPS is our best movie, of course....
I don't know how to riff this
/me hugs LunaTheForgotten sorry dear.. we have to sit through it both..
I'm going to bed
07,1RHPS!

/me goes into a bank and shouts "Money-break. Money-break"
DEATHSTALKER TOO

Why do i get the feeling that everypony who worked on this movie hated themsevles?
Don't worry Luna, have a blender.
what is that?
2,14 RHPS rivals for the BEST movie shown on BMN :P
04Everytime I see RHPS, I think of RHCP
MASTER PLAN. STEAL COOKIES.
/me sobs on Luna's shoulder.(Why must it go on?)
STARSCREAM'S PLAN,starting....now
Aponymous: Best drinking game: See who can pass out from alcohol poisoning first
Night
Goodnight cry!

RHPS?
HEE HEE HEE
Oh
Nvm
06,15Yup, Luna, and who picked it?
This definitely a B movie... ._.
07,1I don't know.. this is evil Discord magic
Creon, that's because they did.
Some cookies. I'LL STEAL THEM! NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW!
DS2 had everything: stupidity, boobs, a hilarious script, more boobs, and THAT SOUND
no this iis a C movie!
/me stands defiantly against the horros of this movie. JOIN ME BRONIES, WE SHALL ENDURE
lol
04DS2 was a good film
C for Cookies that is
Will it blend...time warp?
07,1this is a ZZZZZ movie
I remember who picked it.
CONFOUND THAT LISA
04It had everything a guy would love
DS2 was amazing
But I won;t say
dat cleavage
6Best movie by far was Black Dynamite.
04Nah
Yes.
ds2?
lol
I'm not watching, but is this seriously WORSE than MLP - The Movie?
04No thanks
07,1nah
07,1yes it is Zephirdd
I can't watch this
DYNO-MITE.
really
I can't
06,15Black Dynamite is best A movie
o_o
04Evil Dead II is best film shown so far
Black Dynamite was hilarious
This is definitely worse than MLP the movie
My favorite A movie is True Romance.[/bias]
07,1all wrong
wat
07,1RHPS was
We need Dogma on one week
Oh dear
06,15clearly
I missed Evil Dead II
Evil Dead II is a classic
soooooooooo many children...want some?
06,15:P
I CANT FREAKIN STAND ANY MORE OF THIS. I'll be on my ps3 for the next half hour or so.
Black Dynamite was fun.
So much old mother hubbard sex.
I especially liked the animated series on Adult Swim.
God,These names!!!!
WHY DO I MISS ALL THESE GOOD MOVIES
What I saw of True Romance i liked
Black Dynamite was better than that week's A movie (Jaws)
I forget my kids names
04Se7en
06,15Luna picked RHPS, so it MUST be best movie.
Lol, teacher owned
Tovler: Agreed
But you'll figure it out
If I get picked, I may have to go with Death Bed: The Bed That Eats People
/me nods
Your mother doesn't love you. NOW WHAT.
100 rules of the internets
Se7en/Charlotte's web. My first night.
evil dead iii is a classic
/me nods
You all watched Se7en
but DS2 was a gem
07,1yep
04Se7en is best A film
04Easily
death bed, boy, that's a snoozer
You shoulda married him, now he's a cookie thief.
Damn it!
What about Inception?
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH
The worst klind of thief.
Rotten tomamtoes gave it a 48%
I love that movie!
*kind
Evil dead is the one where Bruce cambell puts a blender on his arm right?
Number 34. There is naughty things about it. Period.
I couldn't riff Se7en. I had to watch it full screen.
A MATOOR MAN
man, I just realised how bad the toot spam must have been for those in the new chat.
Ma-tour
It's the complete oppisite of this movie.
Se7en was great, though.
lawl new chat
04"Wanting people's attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder anymore. You have to hit them with a sledgehammer. And then you'll notice you've got their strict attention" - John Doe
mibbit, mibbit
has Spaceballs been aired here?
Se7en was the one with the blender in the box right?
we should have a mel brooks night sometime
06,15Ehhh, probably the A-movie I enjoyed the most was Across the Universe, but if I say that I will get kicked from the channel. :P
07,1ThePretender not yet
YES HAPPYPONY
so slavery?
Producers-Spaceballs-History of the world
Se7en was great. I think that may have been my favorite A movie.
10RobotPinkie, h8rz gonna h8
I just want to torture everbody with Barney
10XD
ah, Across the Universe
I skipped Across The Universe :(
unleash the horror
04That quote by John Doe are so true
so....
is there a list of all the movies we've seen somewhere?
so nifty
04Oh...
I ditched for across the universe :P
10Haters be hating. I liked across the universe.
04"That" film
Eddie Izzard was the best bit.
where we all NANANANANA'D, and Ghosties was mad
Ahh, the other Beatles movie.
Across the Universe is legit. Wasn't watching bronystate at that time though. Sadface
06,15lawl
economy that runs on sweets...
you guys say 34 but I say rule 34D
If I won the lottery, I would pick Stranger Than Fiction.
We need to see The Wall.
that car noise
/me refuses to talk about "that" film
why
If we're going to watch movies based on bands.
If i won the lottery we'd be watching footage of blenders.
lol
why has nopony picked Dogma yet?
This movie if full of larded scenes.
04But I like the idea of a Mel Brooks night
07,1we need to see LABYRINTH
We need to watch Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
these cars run on bubbles
I'd rather watch an actual wall now.
Across the Universe was the best musical we watched.
06,15Pffft, Ghosties has no taste
yeah
Yes Luna
Dogma ftw
heck yeah
Luna,Hell yea
Nittany_Dischord I am all for that idea!
Or someone could megatroll and suggest Never Say Never.
04Spaceballs, Robin Hood, Dracula: Dead and Loving It
07,1Love me some David Bowie
History of the World
don't forget that
make it so, Ghosties
Never Say Never... Again? Hey I'm down with that.
Wait, there money is also lisences?
and Producers
toyland has suddenly become dystopian
04All great films, though Dracula gets my vote out of those three
6...what the hell are they talking about?
If i win the a movie I'd pick Screamers (1995)
Nittany_Discord: Oh god...
I loooooved Dracula: Dead and Loving It as a kid
and then for lulz we could pick Elephant Man
because brooks did that too
DERPDERPDERPDERP: The Justin Beiber flick.
Here here ThePretender
Luna sheds a single tear.
04I've seen Dracula: Dead and Loving It about 8 times now
Ah. Right.
Bring Keanu back in his leather coat and shades.
and naked gun
07,1so this movie is 2 cd's
lol
04It's THAT good

Dead and Loving is like only Leslie Neilsen movie I haven't scene.
07,1:D
I'm with Ghosties
Babes in Trollland

IM afraid to ask what tis the 8-'s (or 90's?) brings us this time in the name of cinema
DAT OPENING
georgie porgie
what happens when theres a hole in me pocket and it still works?
I can't beleve this was not made on drugs
80's
Across the Universe was okay, the plot at the beginning was paper thin though.
>silent hill. 'film'. NO
how's my summer, did it cure your mind?
Barnaby Barnacle head.
Keanu trying to act in this shit
There is no toy spoon.
He already knows of the matrix
MAAJOR!
millions of cookies
so just bake more?
07,1I wonder where the babes are...
MILLIONS
I think I might make a trip to the gun store.
COOKIES!
OBJECTION
06,15Yeah, I wouldn't say it's the BEST movie we've had as A-movie, Aponymous, but it's definitely the one that surprised me the most
I know why keanu reeves is sad now...
6 months of cookies.
WHO WANTS TO COME ALONG!!
06,15I enjoyed it a whole lot
woh I steal cookies?
LOL
what happens when theres a hole in me pocket and it still works?
LOOOOOOOOOL
I do, I do!
Toyland economy.
Mr. Anderson, what use are the cookies when you're unable to eat?
yaaaay, guns!
HOLD IT!
wait, so you pay for cookies with cookies?
wtf?
how can you drive up the price of a currency?
they arent using real economics on coockies,right?
I sense an underlying political statement.
OBJECTION
Beatles songs helped it.
COOKIES FOR A CURRRENCY? WHAT NIGHTMARE IS THIS?!
Let's gooooooooooooooooo
/me skips to the gun store.
this movie is an elaborate metaphor for the holocaust
Keanu Reeves took 40 cakes!
will there be
OBJECTION!
This is a very political movie.
/me hops in her car
episode 2 tonight
06,15Well, yeah, without the Beatles songs it would have been... I don't even know.
Thats 4 tens!
Toyland is a Capitalist state?
Hop in everypony!!
U LYING I NEVER LOST THEM
Yeah, it would have sucked.
These actors are just blowing me away with their line delivery
but cookie sare persihiable anyway so a million cookies going missing is like a weeks pay or something?
/me hops in
and thats horrible!
capitialism = bad
:)
GONE
I AM!
/me hops in as well.
if there is no cookies i guess he stole them. :->
GONE?!
will there be season2 episode 2 today?
the bastard he took cookies and hid them in the bank.
Terrible movie + Beatles Music : Awesome Movie
/me begins to drive to the gun store.
TO MUCH
ITS TO MUCH
the thought of all those poor little furries going hungry
TOO MUCH
will there be a season 2 episode 2 tomorrow?
hes also being sued for abuse of cookie breaks
NOT ENUFF
NOOOOOOOOOO
Seriously, I've seen a lot of Keanu movies where I THOUGHT "Wow, he doesn't give a shit" but this movie, I KNOW he doesn't give a shit.
oMG Hand cuffs lol
06,15Pretty much, Crickettwb!
grand cookie larceny
GRAND THEFT COOKIE
LOl
LOOOOOOOL
that's it
Dat close up
Martial Arts Zoom

That sounds super cereal.
...oh good god
I love this judicial system
NO TRIAL?
WTFD IS THIS?
/me buys a brand new pistoll
TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOON
You can really see the emotion.
Capitalism sucks much, but there aren't many other alternatives.
/me buys a jetpack and a giant hammer
can I post shipping in this dire time?
YOU WON'T TAKE THIS ONE!!!!HAHAHAHA
2,14 Suspicion on the grounds of lack of evidence...yeah...that makes sense
/me buys a Winchester repeater!
Unless a mid-spectrum economy.
They're really getting into the roles.
SONG
/me aims the pistol.
oh no
and song time comes
song?
The Economy Brazil has is better.
Urrrr
nooo
All you had to do was follow the damn cookie, Jack.
because I keep it cowboy-ish
GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENCE, MOTHER FRACKER!
my ranting got the better of me LOL
now?
My brain is dieing
06,15This movie is genuinely horrifying.
/me flies in the sky and aims hammer at pack
awww piss
SUDDENLY HAPPY MUSIC
this song would be awesome if ponies sang it, don't lie
give us back the smooze song please
/me activates Dead-Eye level 3.
just say the word mods
This song makes me want to pull the trigger more
OMG, my parents are telling me they heard of this movie before (this isn't the original)
Is the stream on? I can't see anything
07,1without a gun?
:/
Trust the guy in black! Trust the mean guy! He's never wrong!
/me remembers this is all a hallucination lisa is having after concussing herself on a tree and falling into a coma
you're not missing anything important
The original is in Black and White.
can we just cut back to the girl in a coma?
Horror movie directors should watch this. It'll teach them how to make something that's actually terrifying.
I still say use the soundboard, make an exception just this once :P
Consider yourself lucky, gingerbrony666
Ponies make any song better
/me must blow self up jetpack why you no KABOOM?!
this a remake?
Its more likely the you think
LunaTheForgotten forget the gun, have a blender.
Jigglysaint, I wonder if this movie would be awesome if it was a pony movie.
ginerbrony666 switch to low quality if you cant see anything
it wouldn't be
/me realises his jetpack is hammerproof
It would be 20% cooler.
lolwut
This gun I hav....oh. Damn it!
A jailbreak! Yipee!
Prison Break
A JAILBREAK
Whoah, brilliant idea.
I still have my gun!
OH TEH NOES
this one is 1986,there is another one from 1961
Girl's not in a coma. There was a nuclear war and she happened to jump through some dimensions.
That totally will work.
That was hilarious.
Jailbait!
I'LL STEAL IT NOONE WIL-wait what
yes jail break much better then finding out the true robber.
what would happen if someone brought a gu to toyland?
imdb says,at least
/me opens fire on this movie!

Really?
06,15Stop right there, criminal scum!
PEW PEW, PEW PEW

what's a Jailbait?
/me jailbreaks ipod so we can be together
why not jailrape!
LOL
07,1the tardis would raise the quality of this movie
Jailbreak != sex
It didn't work. The screen just says: The Broadcast is offline, even if I switch to low quality
Tonight, there's going to be a jailbreak! Somewhere in the town!
lol happypony
jailrape = way of showing love
verry little
I GOT THE JOKE

Bullshit.

lol, Cincinnati is magic

Spoilers: It sucks because it's actually a metaphor for the opening scene at the store
oh,i missed the italian
ThePretender Is your username referring to the Pretenders by any chance?
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
No god damnit
Not more music.
Cincinatti has murder, prostitution, extortion, and more. Theft is the least of your worries.
That's how you spell Cincinnati?

THANK YOU, EMOTICONS!

Wait. It helps you so you blind it....
This is pretty grimdark.
Bird is resentful for Barnaby telling him he'd grow up to be beautiful, obviously.
that's just sick
And that was on my first Brony Movie Night.
Did Santa just suggest they poke its eye out
what blinding it was't enough?
And stay in there you eyeball bastard
PUSH IT IN THERE
next thing you know they'll bury him alive
our heroes!
and set fire to him
it was supposedly attacking them
That bird's got one serious Black Eye.
they're going to release it into the wild, blinded

Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story
6_9 My face, every day all day
This film could be saved if there's a big bloody battle between the trolls and the teddy police force.
/me glomps Luna
/me descends from Brony Heavon.
is it wrong that I'm supporting the bad guy
saved...not
Arms being ripped off everywhere
made better,yes
they did blind his pet and lock it in a cabinet
Heads being devoured
The dreams of the bronies we left behind, and the ones of the bronies that are yet to come wind together in a double helix, forging a path to Season 2!
I can now watch this movie with no pain.
I'm not high ENOUGH to understand this
/me likes how the amount of viewers has been dropping throughout the movie.
That little girl get's all her limbs pulled off by a train
wishful thinking.
I'm out at midnight end of movie or not.
And dump it un the woods
I /will/ make it all the way through this movie
I wonder what Mcguffin they will use to save the day?
whoa... what was that?
PPG are here?
/me thinks he would have to be on at least two drugs to understand and follow this
lol cincywhatski
2,14 ......he just involved the awesomeness in PPG to this abomination
the power of love
even though he properly called it cincinnati already
2,14 BURN THE HERETIC
I have no problem understanding this
I could be watch Power Puff Girls Z
or captain planet
Lol
USE YOUR FAT GEORGIE
Just a hop skip and jump georgie
irc crash...
that pretty much sums it up
wait was there a mareathon tonight? you guys did not answer durring the intermition
if they can find the heart ring for the chinese guy
A 300 lb Genius
But Tovler, PPGZ is tarbl
PPGZ?
2,14 why would there be a marathon?
Power Puff Girls Z
2,14 the marathon was last week
The PPG anime
PPGZ is PPG and that's all that matters to me
What about PSG?
PPGZ, that was a silly, silly invention.
I can't believe it's still on.
PSG was awesome
Wow...didnt know that the PPG had an anime version
There's another website doing a mareathon.
PSG is awesome though
I like how he tosses the vine back to him
Be an hero Georgie
^what
instead of going double like with the girls
k thight might have an impropt to thing.
Georgia dies the end
*insert pinkie jump song*
YOU CAN DO IT CHUNK
your fat won't break the vine, we promise
I hope they make a season 2 of PSG
PSG has that scorched earth ending. Who does that?!! *Gainax*
> mfw look back at chat and see "be an hero"
same
But there probably won't be
It's just a hop skip and a jump!
Ever
It's going to be a one season wonder
/me brohoofs Meanwhile.The Goonies
but there's a poster promoting a season 2
Its called a gainax ending for a reaso :P
There is
nopony knoooows the trouble I seen
/me does the Truffle Shuffle.
But it's from February
nopony knooooows but Jesus
follow a girl in a dress up a ladder
The Goonies was amazing. This on the other hand is a deep fried spunk lollypop.
This new pony season seems wrong without PSG
We need some Goonies up in here.
Didn't that door lead to a tube?
fuck this movie
intermission
Thatll hold em!
playing burnout
PSG?
WHY IN EQUESTRIA is this movie named "Babes in Toyland"?? There is only 1 babe, a little girl, and an old hag.
AND I THINK ITS GONNA BE A LONG LONG TIME
Oh come on! The villians will have an easier time getting to Santa if they go that way!....dang plot
I want Notepad back.
nopony knooooows
all Iknow is that I need more RRRRUUUURRRUUUUU in my life
MLP and PSG just seem so similar to me
BEFORE TOUCHDOWN BRINGS ME 'ROUND AGAIN TO FIND
dat plot
Maybe it's because I'm drunk
Turned over table with an empty barrel. Stops army of trolls.
But they just seem similar
I'M A ROCKET MAN
man those cars are utterly ridiculous
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang was slow, but this is a whole nother level
ugh
Little 5 mph bubble cars.
HEEEEEEEERRREEE AM I SITTING IN A TIN CAAN
PERFECT transportation.
I HATE those cars.
One is a parody of Lauren Fausts work the other is actually Lauren Fausts work :P
What happened last week btw? During the premiere. The stream kinda crashed
Why can't it just die?
FAAAAARR ABOVE THE MOOON
Ahhhhhhhhhh
Did someone just compare MLP:FiM to PSG?
D:
WHY?
They'd go faster if they'd lay off the cookies.
I would so dig a PSG parody of MLP
Pimpsmack
Man, it's been years since I saw Chitty Chitty Bang Bang too... Internet, y u make me feel so nostalgic?
/me shudders
cuz theres so many similarities
PSG had epic Background music.
twilight cars!
I'll kick their ass!
agreed, Drunklestia
The only thing PSG had going for it was the music.
o_o
this guy is not a credible villain for some reason
So slow
If there was an S2 of PSG there'd probably be one
Epic chase scene is a go
Best. Chase Scene. Ever.
I hope not.
It's hard to take a villain seriously in a car like that.
Wow, even the chase scene sucks
Chuck and Spike both got messages from higher powers
07,1this is epic?
Have to laught

i loved PSG
But I don't thing MLP airs in Japan
Toyland Kart!
Mario Kart, Not released version!
he wants her
I hated it.
:3
WOO BUMPER CARS!
PSG had a transformers Parody. Season 2 could've had a MLP parody
He wants a little one.
pedo much?
Epic chase scene has failed miserably
It's that or maiming my self.
i hope PSG makes another season =p
GET IN MA BELLY!
WOO BUMPAH CARS!
One of the worst series I've watched.
:x
Hey guys i have an idea
what if the climax for this movie
:D
oh come on
Its a widget series
"I'll get you you fat f**k!"
This is probably a really dumb question, but... what show is this PSG?
he needs more leverage
At least it's somewhat entertaining
was a bumper car deathmatch?
Where did this film get the funding for this shit?
running on the spot car chase scene?
...
I'm waiting for the track manager to come out and say, "Hey! No bumping!"
Ah.
with Garterbelt
Best....Chase....Scene....Never....
I second derpderpderpderp
except, no one ever bumpos
BAIL
It's an anime that's styled a lot like cartoons
*bumps
Okay. I've heard of that, never saw it though.
Now I want to play Putt-putt and Pep's Balloon-o-rama
owned by a tree
lol
It's all parodies of popular cartoons
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEpy0znKHWs
I bet this film bombed! RUSSIAN STYLE!
That's the one with the girl who looks like twilight?
Music and animation style, I liked it.
were do you watch PSG?
Yeah, that one
2,14 no video links please
Beat up by Fluttershy
Otherwise, the humor was too blunt for my tastes.
:|
western cartoons and potty humor
DEATH
all the time
I think this was a made for tv movie
DIE
this is why we wear seatbelts kids
Even crude humor can be clever.
me?
:p
Damn it
Just look it up on a torrent site
Did he die?
why?
lucky for me, I love western cartoons
If this showed up in cinemas the cinemas would go out of buisness
6_9 < my face right now
Automotive accidents carry a life sentence in Toyland.
except TUFF Puppy
What was that sound effect???

So many western show referances

The trolls win,everryone dies,the end.
Man...those costumes suck, they look decent in the dark
HURT THE NICE PEOPLE
luna how much more of this
the troll army is maybe the best looking thing of the movie
wait they're trees
I used to have a link to all the PSG episodes on megaupload
that says a lot
/me goes back to the 80s.
Lets all forget this movie and talk about psg, agreed?
Sculptures you say
No
:x
But unfortuately this is September
I'm an old man
Leave me alone
Those Discords are nice
They sort of look like really bad cosplays of the tree warriors from LOTR
and not December '10
Lol XD
PSG is crazy, enjoyable, but crazy.
Toymaster says,"Meh."
Lolol
Santa! The useless man in the world!
Don't know about PSG.
That Chocolat song on PSG made me cry gurly tears
toymaster is a stoner
that's the moral
YOU!!!!
THAT'S THE MORAL
the audiance.
like man
believe in toys
The soundtrack is awesome, Tovler
Dumb eleven year old.
Tovler: Huh.
Asian Santa...
Toymaster is a zen master.
are you fucking kidding me
like a man*
the fight guy is thinking it's him...
oh my god, this was 2 and a half hours to get to this?!
Soundtrack is pretty cool.
Damn it Lisa
...so awkward
Theres a fucking moral to this?
I thought I saw a bug walking around on his hat
oh,the "be a child,dont ask to be an adult too soon" morale
Nope. It's you Georgie.
I got my ex into PSG. Lo and behold, she turns out to be more like Panty than I thought.
Toys are real, someone smack those kids
Is the Toymaster analagous to the Wizard of Oz?
no, Georgie is a manchild
"Life made her grow too fast" What are you talking about, I'm a boy, not a girl. I'm not even in this film either.
kind of missed it so far
Loved garterbelts back in time music
He's just bigboned, guys. Come on.
This scene feels like the ending of The Wizard of Oz.

Glory glory aleluiah
Also I think the mods have died in horror

MAIMING IS FUN!!

2,14 I'm cheering for whichever side will make the movie end sooner

indeed, the actual marvel character is more or less immune to everything except fire, acid, and certain herbicides
its not over
so... they're just standing there
meh ok im gonna zap some bitches in infamous =p
Luna this is worse
What a fight scene. The soldiers are walking up to the trees and the trees are backpeddling.
Told you guys. The tree monsters are all Leafing.
I'm going with ValtheJean
our minds will never grasp this movies true form...
/me is still looking forward to the day he will win one lottery.
The costume designers for this movie were overpayed.
Pacifist Acheivement!
Much worse than a spiders tale
And harsh criticism.
Yeah, the sooner it ends the better.
Also, how did you do that
bonk
Eh, needed more shooting.
300lb badass
And Swamp Thing is DC.
and punches were thrown...
Now stab them
Go Georgie.
AND STAY OUT!
Good Lord, how did this movie ever get green-lit? Really.
2,14 do what?
I hate live action shows/movies that shove in cartoon sound effects.
We will never grasp this movies true form...
Close
/me stabs them
I'm beginning to wonder if I'm not stoned myself
I agree with the movie...BOOOOOO!
AND.......FIREEEEEE
Toyland does not take prisoners. They will all be executed.

let's watch Spider's Web to purge the memory of this film
what? then there must be a marvel character that's similar because I recall him showing up in the civil war arc

04AND YOU WERE THERE, AND YOU WERE THERE, AND YOU WERE THERE
Attack of the Giant Crab Monsters is better than this.
/me hugs Meanwhile

NO PLACE LIKE HOME, NO PLACE LIKE HOME
I wish you all could have met the Wizard of Oz.
/me will kill this movie to death!
keanu drove through a blizzard and she got thrown out the back of his jeep
04Seriously, I may have hated this film but I downright despise the utter atrocity it committed of ripping off a much, MUCH better film
it is B
This is god damn z
Hi Luna :)
Wait
This is below a B movie, it deserves a new catagory! Its a C mov- *punched*
Flying out from the jeep?
Nice hallucination!
Is she dead?
Damn, this soundtrack is manipulating me.
Bjust,the B in NBC danger
The length is what really destroyed my mind
Z-list movie
Better than you guys
/me begins to beat up the movie
oh gosh
you gell out of the car and smashed your head, good thing you are fine.
This ending makes no sense?!
DIE!!!
04JUST SHUT UP
This isn't a B Movie, it's a shit movie
2,14 no, it's a B movie, B for "BURN IT TO THE GROUND"
my song senses are tingling
OH SHUT UP! We get it! There is no place like home!
04SHUT UP
04SHUT UP
04SHUT UP
Then they all died
I think I'm going to pass out if this goes on much longer, and I'm not even listening to it anymore
/me retract his fist from Darf14's cheek whilist grumbling.
04SHUT UP
WHY WONT YOU DIE
1 more song inc
No mother is that stupid! Right?!
END
Oh gosh this is Bull

Well he should have gone back in time in that phone booth and slapped himself upside the head for thinking about driving in a blizzard.
/me is slowly crying
and always
Leave some for me LunaTheForgotten
Seriously this is just dragging me out
They won't even end this, will they?
PLEASE END
And nuclear war.
TO HELL WITH LOVE AND TOLERANCE

Ponies? Oh, I am so here now

THANK GOD
Itd over
Thabk you Luna, without you I would be in a grave right now.
I only saw the last 5 minutes, and I wanted to strangle myself from that ending
FUCK, that ending manipulated me.
The shift in tone has given me nausea
We need to kill the trees before they kill us!
Yes, now this I can get behind
*Thank*
Needs higher quality but Im ok with this
04It's actually Sumica who's streaming
WE DID IT, WE DID IT EVRYONE
Adorable little mashmellows and dark matter <3
/me glomps Sumica
Old musicals ending always get me.
Ah do I get my medal now
we made it through guys
wut?
07,1it's not
good night every pony see you in 7 hours. sorry I'm out.
:P
What was the movie?
time for sleep before part 2, have a good night
/me hugs Sumica
applejack has a whole lot of ranks in use rope
2,14 okay people, since this keeps happening I'm going to tell you all now
Well i'm actually going to blender someone.
/me hugs Rainbow_derp goodnight
Bye
we're babes in toyland veterans now
2,14 do NOT flood the chat
Sleep well!
Anything is higher quality after that trainwreck of a movie
nothing can phase us
I'm off, good night all.
2,14 there is a bot in place that will kick for it
it's not me.
faze
even
04Val, I'm sure we'll be fine now
/me and party gains 15k exp! *fanfare*
I will never let anyone forget that movie.
07,1night derpy
I often confuse Derpy with Cloud Kicker
2,14 if you trigger it too much, it WILL ban you
We made it...
/me hugs DERPDERPDERPDERP goodnight
OH GOD! HER MANE T^T!
Lol true
Goodnight Kirzstryfe.
/me hugs Luna
The blender shall live on.
2,14 I am warning you all now, so that way you are aware
06Goodnight Derpy~
04Since that...abomination...ended, I think everyone is back to normal now
I'm not sure how to feel about surviving though...
What about Manos?
Notepad... never forget
non MST3K?
I'm out
manos is just...
snorefest
And Applejack is maxed out on strength as well.
there's no songs at least
Notepad will live in our hrearts forever
I will never be normal again
well im gonna play all the luna.exe's in a row back to back now...
Notepad...?
And the movie was actually post Reagan.
Rarity's accent is weak
....
But then again...I wasn't normal to begin with...
okay
there's songs in that
/me wishes everyone who's leaving a good night.
well I'm gonna head out for the night. Night everyone
Notepad was the best actor in that shitfest.
0_0 just opened high quality stream popout... PONIES IN STEREO!
Infinity plus one is just one.
Better than this gabe.
07,1notepad was awesome
/me hugs Cobalt goodnight
That ending just seemed way too clingy, in fact, it seems almost like a parody of child movie endings: It's like the Doogal Movie ending, where they cannot let us assume that they ended happily ever after
Notepad could have saved us all.
Or so I've been told.
really? it feels like early 80's, early 70's
/me hugs ThePretender goodnight
Hay guys. :)
This is that bad and 140 min long
I admit that drugged up carrie fisher singing is pretty damn funny
i want t nominate notepad for s grammy
..you were told wrong
1986
but adding infinity to anything is silly
XD I'm not leaving yet
Their arguments arent making any sense
And fast.
The ONLY reason I made it through that movie
Is SHOO BE DOO
So tired, fuu
but I appreciate the gesture
can I get unbanned now that the movie's done? :/
Hmm....after only watching a minute of ponies I completely forgot what we watched last ...oh well
My Little Pony, My Little Pony~
Oh.Sorry,I miss read
SHOO BE DOO SHOO SHOO BE DOO
Now this is a good song!
I used to wonder what friendship could beee~
Luna y u no fluttershy room!? I miss you.
04Dear god, it's like an antidote being poured straight into my ears...now THIS is a fucking song
Suddenly, no more Dash

Seriously, this just utterly destroyed my depression.
Imma have to download Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. Now THAT is a nostalgic Musical

Also, I am saddened by this news
/me hugs herospirit and swings him around
Oh god, it's Spike up there holding up the POLE!
2,14 dude, you need to stop breaking up your chat into pieces
2,14 that's considered spam
Why can't it be a regular lightning rod? :c
I think that movie made me depressed.
a magical lightning rod? does it really need to be magic?
ooooh, guys
If this was 6 am, I could get them to do that
Aliens.
2,14 organize your thoughts into one sentence
Rohirrim, herdmind
IT's MAGIC, I AIN'T GOTTA EXPLAIN SHIT.

I mean it's the same channel

THE LEGEND OF THE SCAT MAN
/me is tired
Love it.
Huh?
Ghosties: u mad?
04I would like to invoke the Worst Movie clause
T^T
Headless horse fell into a blender.
Love al the episodes, but this one especially.
I'm confused :/
I guess I missed something besides the episodes and the movies
Ghosties: It's okay, I'd be mad too
fun fact: twilight is making the lightning happen on cue
I'm scared, guys
hi how do i use another irc client for this
Someone hold me...
Ghosties, so it's official: Spider's Web > Babes in Toyland
04That if the entire chat despised the film, then we don't re-stream it
T^T!!!!!
Bruce Wayne was afraid of Scat... thus
oh gosh oh gosh..
Sounds like timmy now
Oh, that story is not sc- YAHHHHHHH!!!!
I wan't to hear the full story :/
Wait. what time did Luna say?
Where'd that lantern go?
/me would like to tell the story of a movie. A movie that terrorized bronies for two hours. Teeth were gnashed, tears were shed, guns were shot!
inb4 cannabalism
/me hugs RAWRity
rarity and applejack are totally avoiding their feelings for each other
suddenly, cannibalism
mib_8z7f8r The server is rainbowdash.ponychat.net and the channel is @bronystate.
Canibalism!!
but then that's no fun
One flag.
Confirmed: Rarity is OCD
hooves == magnets?
Sweetie Bell got blended -> smores.
Om nom nom.
/me page refreshed and cant read old posts
hi natelyn
That movie was so bad not even the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 group would watch it.
Welcome back everypony that left because of the movie that caused widespread depression!
the tale of BABES IN TOYLAND!
Flutterguy: thanks
Ya just eat em
04Yes, Spider's Web over Babes in Toyland. At least with Spider's Web I laughed
eeehaa, Just eat em!
Rarity is NOT OCD
2PM EST
True
Pardon.
with Babes in Toyland we just cried
OCD is totally different
04I *NEVER* laughed at Babes in Toyland
At least Spiders Web didn't drag on for so long
I cried a few times.
Anyone getting the audio derpy?
you know we never did see a single babe in toyland
@Ghosties Agreed entirely! Plus Spider's Web was short!
/me hands out smores to everyone!
being careful and neat is not OCD, neither is not like getting dirty
I laughed once, Ghosties
twilight's clueface
I cried at Babes in Toyland such nostalgia
/me blends his smore.
I mean, I only came a few minutes at the end, and I felt it was too long
I killed myself 3 times I think during that movie.
Yay~
granted they can be manifest in OCD sufferers
S0pider's web is the one with the pig lying right?
/me went to play SC2 and returned to see MLP: FUCK YEAH
ValtheJean: This.
04Web is "So bad it's good." Babes was "So bad it's deadly"
:)
"I know! Jail break! YAAAAAAAAY"
ME!?
Oh, my bad. Re: Dirt - Mysophobia, then. :P
Deadly like me T^T
Luna, are you guys streamming tomorrows episode?
>Pony Thread Simulator 3
Timmy Turner and Da Rules
Ghosties: The movie literally made me depressed.
Or however you spell it, I'm tired
There's another one?
Does this look like an iPhone herospirit?
Oh god

Pillow "fight"? Still looks more like pillow warfare to me
/me smacks Thepretender with a pillow
BOOM HEADSHOT
TWILIGHT NO!!

2,14 please refrain from things like that

Rarity settling into bed time!
and, arguably, in episode 25
<3
/me throws a pillow at ThePretender
Where did Applejack's hat go? D:
I'd sleep past the premiere. Youtube will upload it super fast anyway.
2,14 I was refering to zach's image
I'm also ill. I get really depressed when I'm sick. Sometimes I know I'm going to get sick because of the depression. And then that horrible, horrible movie....
time for a reverse striptease, everypony
YES
heil sleepover nazi
Ponies, why do you need such a big bed?
rohirrim probably a hat rack
Like this
/me charges at Thunder_Dash with a pillow
YESSSSSSSSSSSS

Eeeyah
M. Bison: YES! YES!
I prefer AppleJacks method getting into bed
CAN'T HEAR YA, AH'M ASLEEP
Yes. I understand. I sincerely apologize.
I do not belive in hat racks.

Clop
/me charges everypony with a pillow
CHUU.
So much for element of generosity
aaaashew

why does this fandom need to make me constantly see shipping in EVERYTHING now?
2,14 it's alright, just keep it in mind next time ;)
NOT
RAWRity, Right?
supprised they did't rip that blanket in half.
lol
Twilight spoke, and they were silenced
Why does Applejack look naked without her hat?
She sounds so cute with her mouth stuffed
The number one thing to do at a slumber party is blend things.
wait...
Wait, did anyone count how many times Twilight said fun?
:D Will do!
The book knows all
flutterz, you're right 0.o
I should sleep, but I'm going to be depressed if I don't have ponies to cheer me up.
that sounded wrong
Fun... fun... fun... fun...
She just have to say that
yep
Because she is nake dwithout her hat
Well, I alwayas am :P
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG
aww, she's cute in bad
Twilight. Stop jinxing stuff

I think I'm going to sleep.
Lights on
It's like, I've been writing a fic and every time I write a scene with AJ and RD talking, I'm constantly on the lookout for anythign that could be made into a double entendre
OOOAAAHH T^T
Wait.
/me climbs into his bed.
still that's fascinating how she can seem so unclothed without her hat
but I can't decide
...that's not a loose branch
Suddenly rainstorm
I agree, happypony
How is the rope just staying there?
bad idea
inb4 CoD reference
GENIUS
>Tree in a tree
Should I?
GENIOUS
applefail
treeception?
Ramirez get me a tree
/me claims the top bunk of an vacant bunk bed
thats not a branch applejack
gonna finish this episode then go to bed to catch the next episde this morning
And a blender
Treeception!
TREECEPTION!
where did she get the rope from?
RAMIREZ
RAMIREZ
Flutterguy AWE YEEE
and now twilight loses it lol
*BRRRRRRRRMMMMMMM*
HAH! Beat you to it
wait till the end of ep, LunaTheForgotten
CUT THAT TREE DOWN WITH YOUR FLASHLIGHT
Yo dawg, I herd u liek trees.
LOOK IN THE BOOK
Fine
i dont get where thecod4 reference was
lagmobile you say that, and then you stay up all night like I did last week.
LordCelestia soon
So even if her room gets destroyed... If the book says so, it's okay..>?
Ramirez, take out that gunship with this freshly caught mackerel!
A Leaf/branch/tree turducken.
*AJ shifty eyes*
and, as much as it shames me to admit it as a Rarity fanboy
RAMIREZ! HAVE FUN AT THIS SLUMBER PARTY RIGHT NOW!
Applejack is the bigger pony here
Please, I got the book, and the first page says: PAGES
BUCK THAT TREE HARD, AJ!
Thunder_Dash: That just means it was a good night. :3
first: where's her hat?
She is looking in the "B"s
Is everyone having fun at this BronyState sleepover? :3
it... blew off?!
I wish
yea
I am now that that mvoei is over
I know i am
AJ used apology! It's super effective! Rarity friendshipped!
ThePretender: Yes. :3
but I thought the staples would stop
i couldn't even spell movie
that's how bad it rattled me
I am
Babes in Toyland was one Doozy of a B movie
I'm sure almost being smashed by a tree is not a small detail.
yay!
/me hugs Meanwhile
It'll be okay
THAT WAS THE DOOSY!
close call AJ
She should be looking in OMFG THERE IS A TREE IN MY HOUSE!. She would probably find what she is looking for.
b movie? more like -z movie
Babes in toyland was a F-Movie
You need some shoo be doo recovery
I missed the lottery, what's the next set of movies?
I kinda wish we just had 2 A movies
who does the music score for this anyway
There are no staples. It was water soluble glue.
it was a -Z movie
next week's special event had better be spectacular to make up for that travesty
Incredibles is good.
makes a minimal amount of sense
seeing as how it was a rainstorm
and if my suspicions are correct
Incredibles is pretty awesome.
I don't know but it is epic.
Yeah.
1 obvious A movie and one unknown A movie.
there's a special event?
it will bee (tee-hee, pun)
Is there some rule for picking A and B movies? Like the B movies has to be worse or something?
What IS next weeks special event?
still dont get the cod4 reference
How about Short Circuit?
Rarity. How did you get that dirty
Never mind Lord.
?
okay
oooh, Short Circuit is awesome
B movie doesn't have to be worse, per se
a B movie is either "So bad it's good" or a cult classic
I think B movies are less reknowned movies.
Awwwwwhh
flutterz no rule like that, it's just that B-movies are generally lower quality
Johnny 5
I mean, DS2 was better than whatever else we watched that night
I love Applejacks face when she is about to kick the tree trunks.
DS2 was better than anything we've watched so far period
silly Twilight
no
Not in the book = mass confusion
Where did that come from...REALLY?
no
except perhaps inception
she would have sent that clear to canterlot lol
but everyone's heard of Babes
what's DS2?
YES
in during twilight being a huge aspie
deathstalker TOO
I've heard OF it
Tovler: I haven't'.
Dude, what are you two talking about?
I haven't
epic faces
Hi everybody!
>ass
nah
I'm not sure if I asked before, I think I have, but what about Castle in the Sky? Would that be A or B?
wow...
Nope
a really really trippy cartoon?
Epic guesses.
It's chuck testa
That depends, the beatles?
I still say that our B-Movie sometime NEEDS to be "Nudist Colony of the Dead"
That's a telescope, silly Twi
Yes...that movie has no dick
that sounds better
yes the Beatles Movie
I only wonder what their first 17's guesses are
AJ you instigator!
Or Shawn of the dead
I'm only familliar with the song.
Pain in the Patootie
>argue with each other over who's more annoying
SHAWN OF THE DEEEAD
or Hot Fuzz
anypony here seen NCotD?
they all were Chuck Testa
Shawn of the dead is amazing
What's NCotD?
brohoof!
Hot Fuzz? Make it happen.
nope.zvi
and so is Hot fuzz
AAAHH SHE SAID FUN AGAIN
Can movies like Ken Park and A Serbian Movie be played here?
:)
Bring on Alien damnit.
Love the directors commentary
urgh, am I the only one who gets a little creeped out by that thing they do where they go "yeaaah!"
Pillow Hat is best hat.
Edgar Wright should co-direct the next MLP movie
Nudist Colony of the Dead, a musical zombie comedy
considering the way twilight's books are treated
I can't decide if I like Shawn of the Dead or Hot Fuzz better.
A Serbian Movie, I think not
they must have a GOOD printing press in Equestria
the yeeeah thing is so 80s
AJ's left and Rarity's left were the same left...
Hot Fuzz would be a great movie to show here.
ThePretender, no thanks, I like having a soul
And a quite profitable one.
*wap*
thepretender I don't think anypony would be left after THAT
CAUGHT BY THE FUZZ, WHILE I was-STILL ON THE FUZZ
A Serian Movie is probably illegal in most countries anyway.
Aw no more...
I wasn't suggesting it ;_;
night
Wait
seriously, seeing that thing once was enough for me
te "yeah" reminds me of the WACKY INFLATABLE ARM FLAILING INFLATEABLE TUBEMEN
I was just saying that no
Night Jigglysaint!
2,14 oh I needed that cheer up :P
No secret butt fun?
aww, no more requests
Night everyone
Now that my soul and mind have been blended.
aww...no more ponies
THE CLOUDS ARE MOVING ON THEIR OWN WHAT THE*shot*
tovler no illegal, just awufl
be back for the s2 stream
we should watch Lord of War for some serious soulcrushing
Now what
May your dreams be filled with ponies.
yay
I haven't seen it, but I know what happens
Rarity should have told AJ to go to the OTHER left :D
ValtheJean: It's like the weight of the world was lifted from my shoulders...
I needed Ponies after... That.
see you all tomorrow
Alright, goodnight bronies, see ya for season 2!
But Nic Cage is in that movie.
Lord of War is the only Nic Cage movie I can take seriously
Bye guys
Aponymous: We all needed ponies after that. >_>

Pease. No more pre-G4.
Do I need to get my cyanide pills ready?

I do not want to know.
Oh no...no....please no..
/me has a bad feeling about this
Bye ThePretender!
Night everypony.
Sea Ponies are decades ahead of all our cell phone technologies.

Something new i found today.
This does not seem promising.
/me hugs ThePretender goodnight
Night Mean
something worse than G3.5
wtf?
attack the crab's weak point for massive damage
THESE ARE THE WRONG TINY HORSES
Oh, hi Natleyn!
Meanwhile*
WHAT IS THIS
this... this can't be real
What is this?
THESE ARE NEITHER PASTEL, MAGICAL OR CUTE
What in Equestria is this?
/me hugs Natleyn good night!
Uhh....WTF is this?!?!
wtf is this?
What is this? It looks weird.
good news this has a song too.
A stream waiting for a new episode of MLP. You will never find a bigger hive of ponies and friendship.
I'm 18 and what is this.
SEASON 2 SPOILER WARNING!! The episode will be 20 minutes and will involve some or all of the following ponies: Twilight, Rainbow Dash, Rarity and Fluttershy
>mfw this is actually better animated than newborns
I dont think it is from Equestria...
Did he just call her fat?
I don't get what this is. . . . .
please tell me one of these breaks its neck
yes, yes he did
"heavier than the rest of us, she has massive body image issues"
noooooooooooooooo! you b*****
But it is bad all the same.
AAGHAHH FLUTTERZ YOU LIT-*shot*
SNAP
problem? :D
crunch
who is streaming
.....
no really what is this?
luna still
the animation sucks
They.. They have no cutie marks. They can't be ponies...
it's hell
/me mutes the stream
seriously what the HELL am I watching
"I'm not ready?" Rarity?
Well this Draconequus needs rest, see everypony in 8 hours
oh god make it stop
Does anypony know what this is?
LET'S ALL MOCK OUR FRIENDS
stream is gonna crash 5 minutes before the show
/me mocks RAWRity
YAY
man, these ponies are ass*****!
I keep thinking this'll take a bad turn somewhere
I SEE A CAT! I SEE A RAT! I SEE A MAN WIV A BASEBALL BAT!
WTH
ThePretender Same here..
/me mocks himself
I dont know what this is, but I'm sure I hate it.
WTF
I CAN SEE A LADDER LEANING ON A LOG
I've no idea.
Anyone know wtf this is?
Well if the stream magically explodes, I can just watch the episode recording on my DirecTV. :3
Damn morbid curiosity...
So is this, like British MLP?
I thought Discord was the nightmare fuel
think you're getting the HANG OF IT NOW
I don't like this very much...
Its a Holy Shell
but this is much, much worse
uugh. I have to play all my old Wii games so I can sell my Wii with no regrets
what the fuck did i just walk into
inb4 musical number
MY BRAIN! IT IS MELTING!
come on guys let's GET CREATIVE
It's the Sea Ponies shell!
CALL THE SEAPONIES!
=/
> mfw dat laugh
Oh no, RAWRity. It would have more PUDGY PONI
GGgale you barely made it
I'm going to go out on a limb and say "British".
I would be ashamed to be caught watching this
What the **** am I watching?
"Look what we got you. a present made from Beach Trash!"
What is this?!
don't be cross with us
This is the kind of thing that having opposable thumbs would really help with.
DAT SCOTTISH ACCENT
SEASON 2 SPOILER WARNING: The plot may or may not be related to Seaponies!
fuck you
Why is the chat derping?
or useful mouths
or horns
I don't think Hasbro made this
flutterz if seaponies appear
Lol at Flutterz
I will explode
ok, what is this>
with happiness
hes going to mount you
is their a request section?
you now have crabs
lol
Dang it! Their so hard to get rid of.
So was that made on like a 5 dollar budget?
should be #vinyl_scratch
eee, it's a little funny
Why does nopony know what this is?
I'm going too, need some sleep.. good night everyone, hope to see you tomorrow morning.
yes, yes you are different
guys say what you will, this was better animated than newborn cuties
Accents?
YES!
^
yes, it was
Ponez?
lol
Much better
but it was still bad
Ponez!!
After Babes in Toyland, that wasn't so bad.
aaaaah, sweet FiM
Pinkie and the Brain.
This is brilliant!
:D
WINWINWINWINWINWINWINWINWINWINWINWINWIN!!!!!!!!
*breathes in relief*
Pinkie and the Twi
this is win
I'm out for now guys, won't be able to catch ep 2 with you guys (catching it at BroNYCon)
Tee hee :D
Twi Twi Twi Twi
but I hope you guys have fun and enjoy it!

TWILIGHT
Brain Brain Brain Brain Brain Brain
So Twilight want's to take over the world....OF COURSE!
byyye!
NARF

omg what
NARF.
aaah nice Minecraft
That was beautiful.
Hey, it's this again.
HOLY CRAP
bye, and have fun! :D
Yay!
I like where this is going.
yay minecraft!
wat
thankee
More songs? :D
that's some impressive redstone
The time has come to welcome spring, and all things warm and green~!
I watched this 2 days ago. It is alittle off but it is still good
Minecraft....there will be someone better than us at this game :(
this is win
didn't we watch all of these earlier?
agreed :3
same PL LordCelestia
Haha, coincidence much?
Wow.
how serendipitous
Neat! What program or game is this from?
WINTER WRAP UP
this must have taken a week, at least
vinyl is the request channel, right?
Cus tomorrow spring is here!
sometimes I think they plan that stuff
Minecraft
Im in love with this song
happypony I believe so
Winter wrap up!
Ah. Thank you. I should have known. It felt like something Minecraft, though I've never played.
So...how many hourse do you think it took to make this?
some of the notes are slightly off but there's no helping it
at least, yeah
It got a bit lazy in the later part. beats are off a tiny bit.
quite a few
over 9000
it could have been made by a program
except he transcribed it by ear
i remember something about one that converts midi to minecraft maps
I think this guys youtube said something like 20+ hours
zach, there's seriously no helping it, redstone and jukeboxes aren't dynamic enough to do the short notes properly
AJ Solo :3
oh, okay then
Win
If nothing else, you can't say Bronies aren't dedicated.
I envy anypony who can do this, I suck at using redstone XP
Heck, I have seen a video where someone made a Minecraft game inside of Minecraf...yes I am serious this time
Im bobing back and forth uncontrolably
Hey guys, what was the second pony episode?
I've seen that
Mineception
lol
awsome
lolwut
mineception?
I'm going to guess this took a LOT of work.
how's that work
ya i saw that
look it up, a guy made minecraft in minecraft
I know I know. Just so much win and then there's a bit of just spottyness.
He made a 2d minecraft in minecraft
I... wait, what?
No kidding. It boggles the mind the time some people put into the stuff ont this game
yes they made a sidescrolling minecraft in minecaft
How much time did it take to make this, I wonder?
Its an 8-bit game if I remember it, I think the vid is still in Youtube
Using redstone he made a computer that could play it
Ha! :D :D
yay pony polka
yeaaah some Weird Al!
I agree, pony and OMG Weird Al!
Clop clop clop clop clop!
the graphics in his game compared to the graphics in minecraft are similar to minecraft graphics compared to irl
clapclapclap
:D
This is awesome
Weird Al ftw.
Bah, I had to change names to use the chat popput
I can't believe I didn't realize it was him
found it
popout*
minecraft in minecraft
I thought about using the popout, but this just feels right.
This was my song when I was like 15.
2,14 fillies and gentlecolts
2,14 I would like to direct your attention to #Vinyl_Scratch, where we will be taking youtube requests
2,14 that is all
I think this one's Polka your eyes out?
AND Let's all have a round of applause for Luna, who was kind enough to stay up with us!
like we haven't already been doing that
we put your minecraft in your minecraft so you can mine your craft in minecraft!
/me glomps Luna again
luna still here?
I am not sure, but I do have a copy of the album this is from right next to me, and I can check if you'd like?
oh I DO, trixie, I do
Yes. Weird Al. I wish my girlfriend was more like you.
All ready for epp 2 tomorrow?
Hey ValtheJean, what was the second pony episode tonight?
eeyup
(wait, did valthejean use M+ right there? I got absolutely no way of knowing)
That would be great. I moved and since then can't find my Weird Al albums.
#vinyl_scratch
He did.
We're Russian around
alrighty then
/me laughs at lightirc
eeep. I requested a musical number from a certain movie... heh heh
luna went to bed already LordCelestia
It would appear that is is "Polkarama"
I just realized how dirty these lyrics are
Hello LordCelestia
Ah. I must have it confused with his "Bad Hair Day" album. Thank you. :D
ALRIGHT EVERYBRONY, GNIGHT. Cyall for the premiere of S2E2!!!!!!!
heello discord
i didn't realize weird al did versions of these songs
the popularity of certain characters seem to be a direct inverse of their screen time
now I ain't saying she's a goooold digger
No problem! ;)
haha censoring
derpy, dj pon3, luna
Also, Rarity is NOT a gold digger. She's a gem digger.
much classier
oh boy
yeah^
I think it's because we want to see their characters explored more. We don't have the screen time so we make things up.
this video.
I think if a pony showed up for ONE frame with a distinguishing feature, the fans would be making 34 of her before the episode was over
YES
I guess
/me prepares his tissues
aaaaaaah
I was about to go watch the MC in MC video, but...
I dont know where this is going, but I think I like it
she still aint messing with no broke *****s
This may be the official unofficial Brony anthem. Well, at least I think so. :D
ive never seen this video
I agree and support your first statement completement.
oh nvm
i have
i haven't
what song is this?
Okay. I just switched to French... for some reason.
What's the title of this vid
Are you proud to be a Brony?
Canadian?
Proud to Be a Brony
yrd
feeding ferrets fish?
oops, I mean yes *facehoof*
I'm ashamed to be a brony ;-;
Proud to be a brony
whyy!?
don't worry Tovler you'll get over it :P
why?
I used to live in France when I was a kid.
Seriously, the guy who made this song? GET HIM A MUSIC CAREER
*eee* :p
ah
I was that for about three weeks, then suddenly LAWL I'm headed to toys 'r us
I prefer to just keep my bronyism to myself
yes
"Are You Proud to be a Brony"
What happypony said. :P
song name
I was thinking that the "unofficial" theme was this, Pony Swag: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1HZp4ClFXY
other than when i watch it with my little sister at my house
NSFW language, watchout
I'm proud to be a brony, but nobody irl would ever let me live it down if I told them
It happens occaisionally. Though I can't help it.
Oh, and loving the pony emoticons, whomever implemented these.
I'm planning on being more open about my bronyness once I've got napowrimo done.
"live it down"
as if it's something to live down
I don't even speak it fluently anymore though.
Do you offhand, know what the name of the song currently on the stream is?
"Pony Swag" is good, though I'm not big on the language (as if I have room to speak).
oh I love this part!
This song?
Yeah
I have buddies on campus who are bronies
Yeah, it's "Proud to be a Brony"
This guy has a good voice, give him a career!
I'm proud of myself. I converted a guy to MLP:FIM at my college.
Excellent, thank you! :D
True_Dischord You're lucky. I haven't found a single one.
darf14 that's what I'm saying
So I don't have to worry about hiding being a brony
What song is this?
You're welcome! ;)
I was sitting in my engineering class the other day
wouldn't it be funny if they replaced the term C-mark with boobs?
bored
Btw i have already ordered better internets, sadly they furbared my order

Oh. Thanks convenient end.

This is my mment everypony
So should we start calling telling people you're a brony "Coming ou of the Stable"?
I remember seeing this on NG

Who more of a Troll, Me or Celestia
True_Dischord Yup, only one pegasis that I already knew before school starts.
Of my internet friends, all but... three of them are bronies, of my IRL friends one of them's a brony, another one knows, and I dunno about anypony else
