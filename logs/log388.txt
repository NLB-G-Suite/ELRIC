guess*
Hmm, should i get Guild wars 2 or mists of pandaria... What to choose
i can see again
Wrek should wrek wrek
then it lagged
His name on steam is GURGAMESH
I would choose GW2
SayWhat: Not much of a choice there
Welll
I'd choose neither.
GW>WoW
LAST D'AWW PIC FOR A WHILE: http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lla4vpWyE61qh979ko1_500.png
GW has the no monthly payment
have you ever had a pizza, covered in chocolete and suger? 'cause I have
dafuq whas the white shit?
WoW is killing WoW and Blizzard knows it. Best to go with GW2.
But wow has better dungeons and what not
my little fillys~
We don't know that yet
PILLs
PEELZ
the daww must be countered
Well, Blizzard seems pretty hyped about making that new MMOFPS.
>better dungeons
GW2 is supposed to be based a lot on PVP too though
NOOOOOOOOOOO
/me *cough*
ORRRRR, should i get Borderlands 2 or Guild Wars 2
Don't counter the D'aww
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/137775
o_o
oh look, i got a steam message..
whoever is a younge derp say I
borderlands 2!
lol
wat
brb
Cracked up at that since there's really not a lot of footage of GW2 dungeons, but what I *have* seen is pretty awesome. >_>
blow all the shit up
blizzard MMOFPS? tell me more
lol asshats
:>
Can anyone tell me tips on how to not screw up when talking to a girl?
Dark_Horst: It's an MMOFPS. It's called Titan.
I would get both GW2 and Borderlands 2
That's all we know.
imma google dat
Also, Torchlight 2
HEY DOES ANYONE LISEN TO ME
Violet?
no we don't listen
Dark_Horst: Or, rather, it's a "next-generation MMO".
Wrek.. y u no accept
But that basically means MMOFPS.
Hi all :)
OMG Eulshy that's too much counterd'aww
in other words, buy my shit, and I'll let you in.
ohai Paradise92
pfsh, blizzard and innovation, right
I know, right.
But they're not the only ones.
/me tackles Jim
Diablo 3 is best game.
*flys away to neverland*
then no more daww shall be posted
CCP are making Dust 516 or whatever.
Diablo 3, pft
Blizzard is making an FFA game :)
This = best image ever: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/59540229/GM.jpg
not FFA
Taze her!
F2P
you mean like pokepark?
sry
I would play that all day
GabeMoist: Exquisite
so basically a pokemon FPS?
YES!
AllisZero drew it :3
somepony streaming?
Wrek is
Wreks to busy to save you.
you'll need moar boom
he just shoots instead
Send out bloodwing!
GabeMoist: What the hay am I looking at?
and this is why i upgraded mag size on that thing
Diablo 3 is a single player RPG that wants to be an MMO so badly that it dresses slutty like one, hangs out with a bad crowd like one, and demands exorbent amounts of your money like one.
O.K i'm back and I got you a suvennire want it?
Bloodwing!
Bloodwing is best wing
somepony send wrek an MLD quote
boom
it'll be funny
Dashie_Dashie I sent you a steam fr
finally my computer is starting to lag less
use BOOMvolver for massive damage
SCOOT SCOOTALOO?
Wow, these guys have the most overdramatic deaths ever.
or, well, that... thing
Not bloodwing but that works
BRB
Melee kills seem to be more effective than guns
Why do they run liek they're straigh from GMod
maybe the virus got programmed in gmod?
Still alive~
Anypony here who has steam add the player PinkiePieCopy
This was a triumph
SayWhat|FlutterWisp: they are being driven insane by their implants, and Wrek is NOT going to have enough ammo to finish this
Oh jees

1,3we did Terraria a while back too
HALF LIFE
fallout 1!
00,03NEW VEGAS!

amnesia!
/me goes back to watching ghost stories
amnesia
00,03Don't kill Rex! D:
Whatever floats your boat, Wrek.
1,3fallout would be in the same vein as skyrim

ooooh terraria
amnesia
Wrek: Amnesia do it man, please!
whats not fun about watching a guy cowering in a corner
We should play terraria
i once played 8 hours in one session. the KI noted that it was worried for my health xD
wrek: Play half life PLEASE
Wrek: YES!
this is gonna be GOOD!

but we have to make you play amnesia
YES I LOVE ALL THE HALF LIVES
every single 2 games
unless you count the broken up episode
s
00,03I prefer Half Life: Synergy
i liked Opposing Force the most
or the first game spin offs
i'm sure a lot of people heren never saw the original half life. might be good for some advertising
long credits are long
god how long are these credits
I played the shit out of the first half life
Dark_Horst, these people should be made to watch freemans mind
Anyone played Moonbase Alpha and how is it?
unfoundbug: i actually picked up on that. it's awesome
first update in 6months a few days ao

much obliged

Question: Does anyone else think it would be a good idea to stream the entire Indiana Jones series over a period of days like when that Miyazaki film came up in the lottery?
curse you WINDOWS UPDATE!
delete system32.exe
lol delete system 32 your game will run much smoother
pinke pie broke the 4th wall again
problem solved
NS is on the prowl
0,14If you get a 3-win streak in Quick Battle, Algol becomes a fightable character
delete system 32 that will run faster
GoddamitVistabot
Midnight_Fyre: it would be a GREAT IDEA!
.-.
:O
Deleting system 32 would make your computer 20% faster
I told Wrek that he accidentaly the stream
oh happy birthday NS :P
0,14so, what I did was get a 3 win streak, and just kept searching until Algol showed up
ffs stop spamming him
I think we should do it
...
Maybe we can skip the 4th one :$
del system32.exe
I think he did/...
lol
oh ShadowofPony708
Just delete the sandvich
is anyone else in a white screen
/me goes to do what saxypretender said
It attracts heavy virususes
yep
ja
hello
everyone telling him to delete system 32 shut the hell up you arent funny or cute
0,14just a heads up, that Algol is either an A or B level opponent, so it won't be an easy dight, BUT still easier than Legendary Souls

You can't simply pick a favorite pony

If they wanted to be assholes they would've simply cancelled the show
So... Half-life?
Hasbro is unfucked
and not think about us
I can pick a favorite pony
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: cheerelie, though not sure if she's still secondary after h&h
Nu
dont hate we gotta tolerate this isnt that our motto pointing fingers never solved anything
i can pick a fav
/me favorite pony is Twilight Sparkle >.>
yep i think she is
DaringDude: agreed
Trixie BTW~
I guess they cant have a lawsuit over a pony even if it is our favorite
/me Rainbow pony is best pony
I love Trixie
but if you dont pick celestia you get sent to the moon regardless if you like bananas or not
Favorite pony is Sweetiebelle.
the only thing u can hate is Gilda
Nice
metoo
;) <---- best ^__^
what'd they do to RD?
Everypony is best pony
Remember folks, it could be just iTunes doing this. Hasbro might have just given iTunes an edited version, but Hasbro could still use the unedited version.

WOOHOO i cant wait for monday
MEDIC SPAM
dShould i get a bronynet account?
Yes but it's hard to get more.
well, if those "friends" are willing to so easily throw away a friendship over difference of interests, maybe they arent very good friends to begin with
Oh I see TOY_PON3. But you know, hes the one being silly.

/me freaking out that Wrek might be ragequitting all drawings.

goodnight kirzstryfe
Take care kirzstryfe

05haha
night kirzstryfe ~ Sleep Well
Night Kirz
wtf is an AFK?
Hello there fillyfillyy ^__^
love that drawing
hi
hi Polydunami
away from keyboard
Hai
You know, this stuff really is awesome
lol CCCP
^^
AFK= away from keyboard
I want that pic
CCCP: You do have a valid point that I obviously missed. I'm referring to the ones that dislike bronies simply because they feel it's "wrong". Much like gay marriage: they say it "destroys the institution of marriage" but look at all these celebrities getting married and then divorcing like a month or week later, meanwhile everybody gets their panties in a wad when they see two men or women that truly love each other
thanks fillyfillyy for reminding me that i used to be sad....
dat wall of text
/me begins to google for Pinkie popcorn.
tl;dr
im sowwy TOY_PON3 you want a hug?
DAT ACTIVITY STACK
Gmod?
i'm all good
Well, i'm going to bed, night everypony!
AttackWithHugs: i totally agree
night BrownCowDie
Wrek you must watch Serious luna!
CCCP: And if you're against gay marriage, then I apologize for offending you.
/me hugs TOY_PON3 anyways
type in gilda shut up
sleeps well BrownCowDie
/me hugs fillyfillyy back
AttackWithHugs: im not
:)
/me violently bobs head
Type in shut up Gilda
Forgivness and apologies all around.
shut up gilda!!
shut up Gilda
AttackWithHugs: What happened to the celebrity couples that are actually happily married?
SHUT UP GILDA
Challenge clear
i dont understand how some one in this day and age can be against gay marraige
Samuel L Jackson is happily married
So, I'm not the only one pondering around the Internet bored at midnight, and click on BronyState?
I don't mind the new "Stride like Applejack" video. Still think "Play like Pinkie Pie" is best video
/me is fond of the gay community
SHUT UP GILDA!!!
05stop spamming
shut the fuck up gilda!
:p
sorry wrek
Samuel Jackson: is the man
I've been on bronystate about 50 hours in the last week
Indeed
I'm on bronystate a majority of my day.
Dashie_Dashie: Same here
^
for the past month and a half
I'm only on during the evening or late night
/me stays on bronystate for the rest of my life
When I have nothing else to do
I'm only on the weekends.
FRIDAY NIGHT, YO
Dashie_Dashie: Are we considered Regulars then?
Polydunami: I wasn't referring to the celebrities that actually have loyal and true marriage. I'm actually talking about these "marriage" like Kim Kardashian had.
my cat came to say hi. Can't type...
Eeyup TOY_PON3
:O
Ugh, don't remind me of that :D
MIKE WANT
mfw AttackWithHugs is still ranting on about marriage xD
IT'S NOT SPAM it's a request....... ;(
There a way of determining regulars here...

^TOY_PON3
awesome music is awesome
TOY_PON3: i am on mane chat most of the time
daw
TOY_PON3: It disappoints me that that kind of marriage is accepted yet two men who love each other are scorned upon. And it's because of how people are raised to believed.
<3
I've met people because of this chat
fillyfillyy: But I never see you talk during... :(
TOY_PON3: To me, love has to color or gender.
no*
im a quite person
Oh..

flutter_spin: I think so..
flutter_spin: did the who do what now?
kat im back couldnt connect to site
what did i miss
I'm on ze site
13give it a few refreshes, maybe a ping
um, i think 000host might be down
yeah, it stated that it was down and couldn't connect
13they aren't down, just slow
so is the stream still dead?
dead on my end
/me yawns
000host is down
well my router tends to die between 11 and 12, but I could connect elsewhere
13bed.. hmm...
09,01funny thing with DJMAX

Nuuuuu.
/me gets sleepy
13000web isn't down
Im not tiiiiired

Sorry, chat derped out again
I'm back now
well this is odd
bed...sounds good right about now
Anyone else think my cat is perty?
the refresh button is not working
09,01I spent like thirty hours on it, just for my reflexes to catch up with the note speed. Then, mastering 4Buttons. I've spent like 100 hours in the series, and I still can't tackle 5B or 6B. 4B still gives me trouble.
wrek sleeps?
sleep..sounds even better
09,01It's...MERCILESS.
um guys
Anyway, why does Polydunami like thigh high socks? It's mind-boggling
mfw Bronystate won't refresh
oh god..

11,01Wrek gets off stream so late that it's too late for me to stream anything.

Same to you Eulshy
11,01And I wanted to stream a game event with a really special guest Sunday, but we couldn't get things together.
well keep ourselves entertained
13i would stream but too tired .-.
13be restreamed rather
Nittany_Discord: Who was it? If I may ask
09,01so you guys can make fun of my absolute inability to keep up with the note charts
Really special? Who?
yeah guys something is wrong here
is no one going to stream then
11,01It was going to be with FimFlamFilosopher.
/me frowns
I tried opening Bronystate in another tab
13otakon: the nameservers for bronystate.net are slow
argh
11,01I don't own the games he wants to play.
13not within our control
Shizuka: nameservers are fine
or has the ip changed
fantastic
11,01That's why I was asking for DoW and Civ4.
13000web is not down
so Bronystate is down or what?
Oh nvm
13because i just checked it
11,01If I can get those games, we can make the event happen.
it's not down, but the connection keeps resetting on me
flutter_spin: :3
Can't tell if lag or no stream is on now.
Dat MSP3K
11,01But I can't buy them because I'm in a financial crisis.
brb, have to reload chat
P=whaddayathink?
good thing the chat is on a different domain
^
yeah
but I'm using the irc client
http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/www.bronystate.net
I'm on the site itself
also this
bronystate.net resolves to 31.170.160.83
mother of god..
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9s-VkwSfNA
...
Oh god
Oh good lord Ive seen that.
I should have asked Wrek where to find that mlp pic
i sware vince is doing that deliberatly
lol new scout cross over soon
Shit I shouldn't of done that..it won't let me back on..
what the HELL was that?
suddenly anon
also, mfw I'm suddenly a random pony
oh well
yh, just me on ponychat directly
sry. I was just brainstorming what Wrek should draw next
Shizuka: i cant get to bronystate.net at all, 31.170.160.83 is unrechable
bc it seems bronystate stream is DEAD
it's DED jim
13probably in the middle of shuffling IPs
Bronystate is ded for me too
0,14...Everyday it's shuffling?
guys
didn' you SEE the link I posted before?
13shared hosts don't typically give you statis addresses, that's why it's usually godawful expensive to get an SSL cert on them
http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/www.bronystate.net
Shizuka: do you know what dns server 000host uses?
soooo what i do should i read or play tf2 ?
Dang it, human ponies
How does that even work.
what's wrong with humanized ponies?
13they tell me to point at..
i know that artist. not irl, seen his work before
im tryint to turn my sister into a pegasister. i think its working.
13ns01.000webhost.com and ns02.000webhost.com
Nothing, it's just a little unsettling
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Let's play tf2
I was just looking at the outfits. They look nice.
I don't see how
I'll get used to it I'm sure
that resolves to 31.170.163.18
unless it's in a graphic sense or some such
13and yfw mtr-spamming bronystate.net gets through fine
I'm just happy they're dressed up, to be honest
I'm weird that way. Sometimes I feel like Rarity, looking at only the outfits
this video omg if you like bfbc3
mtr?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcuUqlXKJQ
Wow..how long is Bronystate gonna be down?
13fancier tracert
until someone decides to stream

I think Twilight's Mane6 theme is best
Yeah, you really do have to be tough for G3
flutter_spin: I agree
hehe
/me checks G3
I did agree Rarity's theme might be a bit quiet for a fighting game
So....how about that Derpy?
no 4th wall
dont do it
0,14RD's theme for fighting is Magic: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wFCwuTiwAo

Derpy NEVER happened
13this chat is too depressing
/me does Applejack pokerface

Applejack's theme really got a good oomf in the music, but I didn't care too much for that banjo
they did not get rid of Derpy
Derpy will NEVER be forgotten

That feel when your awating SuperBrony64 to magically appear and start streaming.

That's awesome
And Italian intro is still boss
I dunno
extended intro is good, still i like the Italian opening the most
fine.
mfw my parents didn't show up on the local news :D
i agree flutter_spin
Nostalgia, for me
wtf Hasbro changed Derpy in the iTunes verion :(
yup
I found it funny that while watching a reaction video, the guy said "oh hey, did you see that new intro. It was the bomb"
you don't say...
Wait, WHAT!?
late to the party bro
That is how I found out.
DERPY got changed?!?!?!?! :O :O :O
thas so gay
lol. Yeah, we knew that when EQD posted it 5min in
dont remind me TOY_PON3 :'(
i found out from bronystate too
Derpy is gone!!! Noooooooo
but a long time ago
yep
/me snickers evilly
The puns They Burn !!!!!!!
Oh god, the puns
:D
O.o
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gwObcjGCVA&feature=related I shall repost my reaction of the situation
also intro needs more trixie
fuck people need to lighten up how does Derpy make fun of mentally challaged people
mfw I can't play the extended intro cause my brother's wife is here :(
O.o??
she'll make fun of me i know it
Oh...
thats when having headphones rule
is anyone going to stream something?
nope
she's looking at my direction...
/me likes Derpy's new voice, but the character redesign was entirely uncalled for
eeyup
tell her hi from me ~
I just had a random thought; what would the cast of Futurama do if they suddenly found themselves in Equestria?
and THE FULL THEME KICKS ASS
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Will do
xD
:D
/me yells to his step sister, "HEY THE GREAT AND POWERFUL TRIXIE SAID HI!"
HI TOY_PON3's brother's wife!
:D
so much more to it now so when the kids watch the opening video they might appreciate the animation
TOY_PON3, what is your steam?
CrimsonFoxx: Zoidburg would bunk with Pinkie, Leela would scoff at it but hang out with Twi, Bender would end up hugging Fluttershy and I don't know what els
you mean this?
Hi her i said hi too!! :$
RaveBrony: TOY_PON3 :d
*Tell her
no not ponies flutter_spin
Have some italian intro http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dchiYx5Hzo
Oh, lol, ill look it up now :P
as in the crew of Planet Express ends up IN EQUESTRIA
/me yells to step sister, "HEY A BRONY THAT RAVES SAYS HI!"

/me wonders what'll happen if a human winds up in Equestria and DOESN'T TURN INTO A PONY :O
Hilarity ensues
then he will be shot on sight
I guess
Oh god....this theme O___o
lyra would be happy
Polydunami: The universe explodes, and then explodes again.
I wouldn't mind being a pony.
^
dear god dem puns....
I dunno
I'd be the most badass pegasi around.
/me eyes grow wide
Polydunami: they will try to hug Fluttershy ofc
i like hands though
I'd even beat rainbow dash in a race.
lol
I know I would
Yea, Lyra would flip out
I'm getting major Mary Sue vibes here
Speaking of humans in Equestria, has anyone here seen Turnabout Storm?
what would you rather be as a pony unicorn,pegasi, or earth pony
Pegasi
does anyone else just want to scream out FRRRRRIIIIIEEEENDSSSS everytime the intro ends?
Pegasi
no one wants to be a earth pony resulting in a flame war
unicron
Sooo...this is my reaction to the extended intro
I know i do, flutter_spin :)
pegasi
/me makes Hugh Jelly face "ME GUSTA!"
If I HAD to be a pony, I'd go with unicorn
Lol!!
flutter_spin: i do
the feeling of flight is what most people want to experience
ever since I saw that bronycon video, I scream it
That intro is nice, but it IS rather cheesy :D
I would so be a unicorn
I am sad :(
RaveBrony: Indeed :D
i think pegasi is the obvious choice
mmmmm cheesy
I would be a unicorn.
Applejack of my eye :D
a Rarity to come across :P
as easy as pinkie pie
I would be a unicorn. And then I would find a way to fly with magic.
Hurrican of puns
/me returns to painting
I think id be pissed if i got sent to a equestria and became an earth pony :D
Once bitten

I should really work on my Sonic crossover fic some more...
you're too slow~
eventuslly
I should really work on this pony drawing i have in front of me...
lol i just had to do that pun
No, eventually

I can't wait till everpony stops mourning about the loss of Derpy
I assume there isnt a single one of those fics where he doesnt go back.
/me is no longer sad
I can
OneTrickPony: Good, good

i hope
I hope she stays... i wasnt ahuge 'OMFG Derpy' fan, but its still nice to spot her now and again :P
damn song creppy as hell but i can't stop listening it
yfw's when Derpy will be given back same voice and be called her name again

hi Mutterguy
It's midnight on here
You must draw TOY_PON3, draaawww!!
I was trying to think of a story related to the tails themselves since nopony in Equestria knows what he was in his world, so I was trying to think of some kind of story of him befriending a fox
RaveBrony: But I need to do homework first :(
aw, never gets old. Just love hearing every sing the intro
Tomorrow will be DRAW day
What!?!
Homework
Besides, he already saved Angel earlier in the story.
Are you shitting me they cut out the word Derpy from the last round up?

Then wtF are you doing on bronystate? :[ get your homework done right now Mister!

She sounds like a girl now
randall must die'

Ah! No buts about Derpy!
New episode is next Saturday
there was no new episode this week
TOY_PON3 NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
*this
he's gone
Why the fuck did they cut derpy out?
bc
no he cant be
because she sounded ... derpy
it offened somebody
Its there still a downloadable episode where she SAYS Derpy?
no
she still lives in my heart
because it "offended" people
unless you rip it from Youtube
torrent-wise i mean
Bullshit
it should still be on the dvd?
Because people were making a mountain out of a molehill
ha ha ha. this I already knew! I fooled you.
How would Derpy offend people

You are ASSUMING THAT not that its true

I want the video!! :(

I didn't care for Derpy's old voice too much
Im pissed that they said Derpy would be fine
They lied to me!
well it was the first voice
LIEZ
it was the one they decided to stickt with
I mean I don't mind the new voice
but the edit is really badly done
/me might need to find a room that will let us bring a dice bot though
Fucking bullshit hasbro, lieing to the lot of us saying she was fine
how is it badly done?
Where do i get the old 'The Last Roundup'?
and they basically take out ALL the significance of the scene

Night flutter_spin ~
the youtube version of derpy is fine, and even with hasbro changing her she's still my favorite wall-eyes pony
night flutter
It didn't sound like they put their heart into it when they did the reedit of Derpy's scene.
Now that pisses me off even more that makes it look like they didnt give a shit
Bye flutter_spin! Have a good sleep :)
thnx for the youtube vids :)

LOL
MFW ponies make me listen to kesha ~
hiya AndyTheGeeky
/me whispers,"mods asleep; post ponies."
Yea but the fact is they lied ot us and they said she would be fine
ohai AndyTheGeeky
They way they said fine would imply she would be Derpy name and all
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWUdX4yhgK0 look at the top comments
It probably was fine until shit hit the fan.
I mean only over protective over sensitive soccer moms would automaticly assume derpy was mocking mentally challenged people
Ohai
you mean until shit hit the "fans"
at least we know there was that moment RD said Derpy, LOL
People need to fucking grow a back bone and stop being over sensitive
Indeed
Oh, hey o.o
Not everything is mocking someone you over sensitive twats
Let's stick to love, though
Im doing this keepvid thing whatever it is
lol
tolerance, babe
^
indeed
Oh someone is acting stupid it must be mocking retarded people!
Guys if you really wish to act send a Respectful letter to hasbro and itunes, keep the love & tolerance please
guys
seriously... lets stop talking about this, im getting pissed off at the people that are pissed off about the situation... she was changed for the DVD to keep the idiot whiners in check so LETS DROP IT!
I have to show you this
Wow, I haven't used this laptop since Rarity went to Canterlot - and left IRC open
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg-_HeVNYOk&feature=g-u-u&context=G2751c51FUAAAAAAAAAA
outlaw derpy talk
:'(
O.o
drop it *music plays*
They left the episode unchanged in the DVD, Midnight
Let's talk about cupcakes instead.
G3's weird
chocolate cupcakes I hope?
T~T
I like those
T_T
I liek chocolate
it better be food or someones gonna be kicked for naughtiness
pie is best dessert
damn it why'd I have to watch that damn video
Le sigh
now I can't see!
Damn otakon|PONYCHAT Really ? killing my mood like that ... :'(
Cheesecake is my personal favorite.
stupid emotion
no naughtiness, that would be nauuuuuuggghhhhty
Today, I had chocolate cake with buttercream icing at my little cousin's birthday party.
DAMN YOU EMOTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i like the fanfic. i thought it was pretty funny.
Omg...this vid.....omfg....
just bottle it away otakon
Damn it otakon why are you making me cry
^
Im tearing up....wtf!!
I told you that it must be seen

/me covers his eyes and looks away from the chat
you mean these cupcakes Twi_Fi http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-mane-six-cupcakes.png
Buck this i'm going to hear smile smile smile for 20 minutes
Those cupcakes are epic!
/me bursts into flames out of anger
Cupcakes!
As it should be.
WAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH:'(
Now I really want cupcakes.
But do those people not relise the voice actor for derpy thought derpy was a boy
G3 Pinkie Pie sounds weird
They even have gay bacon strips for the RD ones!
really otakon|PONYCHAT you killed my mood completly ...
dat typo ^
Yeah, Tabitha didn't realize she was voicing a girl pony
irs airhead strips CrinsonFoxx
Because, you know, girls can't have disabilities :|
yeah she didn't but she got the idea for how Derpy should sound from her neighbors kid
I know, but that's what they call them in Epic Meal Time
lets have something more... not sad, like this http://derpy.me/yhsDC
yh
dat typo made me laugh way more hatder than it should lol
harder*
I want to see a Derpy themed cupcake. And note I said themed and implied nothing else!

Midnight_Tempest: would make the best BLT ever
:D
oh and hi otakon|PONYCHAT
On Food Network, I found out that there's a place that sells maple apple bacon doughnuts.
A BLT salad?
its slogan is 'When everything has to taste like bacon'
Baconaise, Bacon, lettuce and cheese on toast
delicious
feh
wb Jaketehsnake
Borderland 2 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh98sWNvXBA&list=FL-Hazup7yAgQIdVzXNI0AJg&index=3&feature=plpp_video
and damn it all
You forgot the tomato, Otakon
when you put bacon on a salad, it becomes a game of find the bacon in the letuce
I can't stopp watching that one vid
Oh Hai Bronystate. Thank Otakon! Whats going about!?
CrimsonFoxx: I don't like tomato
hi Jaketehsnake
http://www.thinkgeek.com/images/products/zoom/c87a_baconnaise.jpg
Jaketehsnake: the site is being weird atm, no stream
Borderlands 2 is gunna rock
Still up Jaketehsnake?
hello TheHoodyNinja
I'm just saying, it's just a BL without the tomato
oh god i hear firetrucks
CrimsonFoxx: that's waht the toast is for
Bacon, Lettuce on Toast
BLT
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHiCWvDiHhA&feature=related
Still up, but the circut to the router cuts out at midnight (le 7 minutes) And I havent figureded a way around it yet. I will have to leave soon sadly.
That baconnaise is a lie.
its real
Butter Toast?
It's both kosher and vegetarian.
Its really real
fo realz!
about what?
It thinks its real and it's for sale but it isn't bacon, therefore a lie.
Indeed
G3 spike breaks me so much
Fun Fact: Most bacon bits are made from soy
Remember when portal used to be about portals?
Really?
artificial bacon?? what is this crime against bacon??
Maybe tomorrow Midnight_Tempest me you and a few other guys (Maybe toy pony or count Doofus) should play L4D2 on expert realism again, that was amazing
Anyway, got to catch up on some sleep

SuperBrony64: How do I sober up?
Eat a lot alot a lot of bread
Seriously?
Yup I know from past experiences
When that day comes, the day they execute Derpy, we will fight back. Even if we lose, we will still have our pride. They can take all of our ponies, they can take our lives, but the last thing that we will say... with pride and vigor is... Derpy Hooves...
TOY_PON32 time, that is all
wait why eat bread?!
MOAR BEER
eat some waffles!!

So about Derpy....there is this new petition right
yea im getting kinda depressed about it now
10,02That's the best way
SuperBrony64: Good idea..
Waffles its supposed to soak up the alcohol, it doesn't though, because it can't absorb the alcohol already in your blood and brain
SuperBrony64: Speaks from experience.
or drink more beer till you pass out
No more alcohol
Woah.... .-.

Come mothers and fathers all over the land, and don't criticise what you can't understand.
ahh okay then Snuffsis
thank you Dashie_Dashie
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command. Your old role is rapidly aging.
i see now and i think awesome Dashie_Dashie
what's going on, a couå d'etat against parents?
Times They Are A Changing, actually.
i said hey! what's going on?
and i said
Heeyayyyaayyaya

Hey arthur

Snuffsis: I can't believe I didn't notice the å before now.

You mean the å?
The å.
Coming after æ and ø.

Im soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo bored
No, å before ä before ö
:'(
applejack096: Sweetie belle!
I used to be bored like you.
But I'm watching Watchmen now.
then i took a pony to the face
:S Im sooooooooooooooooo bored
I used to be bored, just like youk, but then i started creating MLP Pixel art in Terraria.
08,01my body doesn't like me
I really like the style Watchmen has.
Then assault your body with cake
LOL wats that im about to search for the mlp fim minecraft now lol
08,01i have papillary conjunctivitis in my eye, some kind of fungal infection/eczema on my arms, nose, and... another place, the tendonitis in my wrist just flaired up, and now it looks like i've got a worm living inside my gut
Jim: Like this?
I didn't understand most of that, but it sounds bad.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvG_LKVrFe8
08,01oh body, y u so fooked?
worm, gut? TAPE WORM.
.___.
08,01looks like it's time to go to the doctor
08,01i blame living in this disgusting house
Doctor Whooves is a very qualified doctor, i suggest you see him.
Fun fact: Human tape worms can grow up to 22.9 meters.
http://derpy.me/eFW7L
Fun Fact: Tape worms were used a method of diet in olden times.
08,01valoreins: i see your gay he-man, and i raise you the full 2 minute extended intro of Friendship is Magic: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4By8YHOnILo
That intro is so awesome
thx!
>gay he man
<3
Isn't that redundant?
yeah the extended intro is awesome
He Man isn't gay!!
>:(
he's just happy
Good morning everypony
gay=happy
Oh, no. It just constantly makes unintented jokes about it.
hulloo CupcakeWarrior
hiya
You mean like MP makes unintended jokes about... uhm, yea.
:D
Also, holy crap
@ the eextended intro
Good, innit?
I wonder who is singing it
extended intro reminds me of WWU
it has a little feel of WWU arrangement
Not realrly a fan of long intros in general though, so i don't really hope it's a 2 minute long intro every episode.
Wasn't the original intro sung by Tara Strong, or at least Twilight Sparkle's singing voice?
08,01# when i was young i was too busy too make any friends #

KwakLad: yes yes it is
Hi guys can someone stream??
Plz
Hello?
Hellooooo?
Helloo
good day Coolbluemidnite
-tumbleweed- :D
?can someone stream?
hey guys did i miss much
not really alexxm
My tounge has gone purple ....
just chat
Coolbluemidnite: held your breath too long?
ok what movies do we have friday
Noh its those sweets that dye your mouth diffrent colors i mixed the red and the blue
xD
ahhh sweet
i love those
Same :)
CCCP the guy doing the physics presentation is a bit of a dick but hes funny
boooored
I've seen that video :O
Makes me lol
'What video?
KwakLad: lol
how do u stream??
Physics presontation about MLP
applejack096 by being a mod with the correct software
MLP physics http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muVfidujxRg
Ohhh can someone PLZ STREAMMMMM!!!!!! SOOOO BOOOORRRREEEDDD!!!
Go on youtube and listen to music thats what im doing (:
^
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=fvwp&v=OEPSd5vho7Y&NR=1
there music ^_^
OR help me with my math
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQysdRTDIYE&feature=related CCCP
Snuffsis what level of maths?
Grr stop reminding me about meh maths GCSE next week T_T
i alreaddy know im going to fail it
x£
KwakLad: who is doing the presentation?
CCCP dunno i just found another video
atm i'm doing repetitions of equations with sqr roots
-derp-
like sqrtx-7 = x-5
and such
Okay
wanna try pm? Snuffsis?
Well, it was mostly a joke hu hu hu, i knwo how to do the math, it's just so boring to do repetitions
for the exam
lol fair enough Suffsis
And in that case, you just do it like so : x-7 = (x-5)^2 which is x-7 = x^2-10x+25
and yea
yup
algebra is the most fun part of maths
Maths is fun?
Which is (x+5)(x-5)
nope EspyLacopa
Well, almost.
(x-5)(x-5)
:)
....
...
They're the same thing, Kwaklad.
nope EspyLacopa
gah
Coolbluemidnite: Yea, it's really fun. :D
xD if you say so
Maths is great
Thought you had just swapped the + and -
way more useful than you give it credit for
(x+5)(x-5) would make X^2-25
Its useful but i dont find it fun cus i always get confused
hate differentiation though
maths is all i do
What is evn more fun, albeit annoying, is trigonometry
maths and physics but physics is the application of maths
trigs really easy though
Well it's offical... Rarity is best pony.
http://i.imgur.com/dyOJv.png
08,01woohoo! BUCK IS ON EQD!
proof
Doesn't help though, since it's got that annoying x-7 on the side, and you have to solve for 0 in this type of equation.
08,01http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/02/nightly-roundup-250_26.html#more
Becomes 0 = x^2 - 9x + 32
lol
Actually it becomes a -x so its -11x
wb wrek
05my internet is fucked
Which still doesn't have handy factors you can fiddle with, so you've gotta break out the ever fun quadratic equation
08,01EspyLacopa: are you trying to find the roots?
05oh well
Yea, PQ-formula is easy though
Well, I'm assuming you're trying to solve for x.
08,01EspyLacopa: yeah, the roots
Yea, find the two xs and see if they fit in with the original one.
08,01use Newton's Method
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=I-BtmZPc9Uc
im reading but i dont understand .. i feel dumb :(
08,01EspyLacopa: it's dead easy; start here, come to me if you have trouble: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg-_HeVNYOk&feature=player_embedded
x=11/2 +- sqrt (-11/2)^2 - 32
Snuffsis i hope this isnt your homework
IT is repetition for an upcoming exam this saturday.
08,01and i like turing computable functions
Snuffsis good luck on the exam :)

http://i.imgur.com/P28Gs.png
:'(
T_T
for some reason, I say Brazzle Nut even though I say Brazil correctly when I speak of the country.
well...that was odd. I lost my ring that i wear probably a month or more ago, have looked for it a few times and could never find it, look to my left today and there it is on the floor
lol x3
To much Brazziers
glad i finally found it, my finger has been feeling rather naked without it
XD
THe ring trolled you.
:D
x]
i'm just happy i actually found it, it must have been hiding somewhere and got shuffled aroudn so it fell out
Its always in the last place you look
/me goes to youtube to see how people say Brazil Nut.
Coolbluemidnite: literally, yes
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-again.jpg
Im bored
/me has no idea what a Brazil Nut is
xD
Its a type of nut
borrred
Do you know about the Brazil Nut effect?
Again
Nope what is it?
yes Snuffis
Morning all, what's up?

08,01it's great
brazil nuts are nasty
08,01oh, bugger
08,01Ingwaz: brazil nuts ARE. THE. SHIT.

Pies and beans?

I like brazil nuts, they're a little on the big side.
08,01took weeks to get the stains out...
Ohhh i want somepony to stream!!!
Had to grav a roll of toiletpaper. xD
:'(
Snuffsis: yh, I can't stop watching it either myself.
08,01but i'm not allowed to talk about that
But you arer talking about it
so, what happens now?
Damn you nature, screwing with my mind, it actually doesn't mix things up for me when i shake ranomd things together, but rather aligns them in layers!
hahaha
Unbelievable ignorance, big, small, light, heavy................. bollox.
God moves the Brazil? nuts to the top because they taste the best.
I don't like nuts.
Neither do I
08,01pumba sounds like nappa from DBZ Abridged
Hey 8D
Aside from Vince's nuts.
You're gonna love his nuts.
^
I love my own nuts, thank you
...I walk into this convo.
Yes.
And my reaction...."wtf"
Vince is the Shamwow guy, you know.
Yeah
asiudfhui
+__0
man, I wonder why I tolerated the Timon and Pumbaa cartoon as a kid?
is it sad that ive only told one person i know im a brony?
IT's okay derpy, it isn't your fault!! It's those damn haters! :(:(
I know man, I know.
CCCP ive told my family and some of my friends
Lion King is awesome.
CCCP: nah, but it is if you only know that one guy however
it is
lol
I SWEAR there's a "line" bit in it though
I can hear someone faintly say "brother" before Mufasa does when Scar has him by the paws

hiya Wrek
o.o
No youtube links during streams...
oh the streams up now!
05lets see how this works
/me headbangs
there's a stream?
I thought so.
o.e
Great choice of music Wrek.
Applejack096 I think it's too late.
awesome music! :D
HOLY SHIT A STREAM!!!
applejack096 wow i did not know there was a website on saving Derpy
You know, I never really cared about the whole Derpy thing
alls i know is im watching something and it sounds like metallicas playing in the backround im like wha 0_o
I cared, I'm still angry about it.
Yep have u watched the derpy vid??
But...I mean she's not DEAD or anything.
ponies?
ya made me shed manly tears
its soo sad
But she was forced to change her personality because people didn't accept her the way she was!!
08,01http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-sopa-be-gone.jpg
i kno!
That is not what you should teach kids
DashingRainbow: she's all but dead, Hasbro has basically said doing this"NO, SHE NEVER HAPPENED". If Studio B thought it was good to show, and they showed it I stand behind their decision.
who framed rogger rabbit!
Okay...?
SIGN THE PETITON NOW SAVE DERPYS LIFE!!!!! 6_9
I mean her first showing ofc, the one that everyone loved and cheered for
I CAN'T IT WON'T LET ME!!!
omfg
What's this? On the stream?
...Whoa
I have no idea
but this should be good
people are poking at the situation to much.
da phoque?
damn, but I need moar coffee
lol
I refreshed browser soo wat have i missed?
what you mean Otakon, the first showing of derpy being called erpy and such never happened?
Snuffsis: yes. They are basically saying now, that Derpy never happened.
DOCTOR WHO TUNE!!!!!!
Time for em to go
me*
That is a load of bollocks honestly. :(
Seeyaaa
i'm still waiting on some official word, there are possible other reasons why it happened otakon
they can't deny
Constant buffering on my end.
not sure if me.
Yeah I'm with Ingwaz...
but i'm still supporting all of the petitons and movements to bring her back
It buffers quite a bit for me as well
But anyway, I gotta go.
See you guys later
Ingwaz: they haven't ever gone back and changed around any OTHER scenes in the show before now.
Guys it is okay Hasbro just changed on DVD ans on iTunes but it pisses me off that they wont show her talk in future episodes
and yet NO ONE found the rythming zebra offensive
cya DashingRainbow
Its still on Youtube guys
LOL I wanna watch Doctor Who know prefferabally the weeping ajgels with matt smith!! :P
No, it's the fan named Derpy Hooves, mare of a thousand adventures
Well, Zecora was portrayed in a positive light.
I think the only other pony that's more popular is Octavia
even if it is the worst case scenario otakon, it wont cause me to abandon MLP, i will simply be disappointed on hasbro and put them on a sort of "probation"
Ingwaz: I'm not abadoning MLP, Studio B didn't do this, it was whatever group of haters managed to whine and roar loud enough.
So much buffering..
-_-
brb
05oh?
otakon: thats part of why i think there may be some other reason, i've heard very very few people voice an opinion against derpy
something seems to be going on, as some have said, its possible its itune's decision, apparently they are notorious for being strict on the content they allow sometimes
Hell, even emangamer thought the scene was pandering and he's not happy with this change of events either.
That's quite possible.
lol
Revised plan: Let's go find where Itunes is based and burn it down, first.
whos streaming??
hmmm maybe
is it lagging for anyone else
Wrek is
yeah
I think he's fiddling with the embed
Hi :)
But The Hub had an episode that was basically Dan Vs Apple.
05better?
looks fine Wrek
DONT BAN ME!
Cole: calm down
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzMq5_thk4o play this on stream plz
Banish him to the moon!
I'm getting more buffering then I should on my end.
BronyinJapan: I don't think Wrek is taking requests
lol
:(
haha
The yogscast?
Anything but Gmod ponies please
Yea, pickle barrel kumquat!
Definitely the sane thing to say before storming normandy
05jsut for testign the stream this is
NOT FLUTTERSHY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
noooooooooooooo Fluttershy
05lag gone?
did dashie just put up a psychic shield?
dat dead Fluttershy
It's fine on my end Wrek

SMILE FOR ANIME
05old news
Derpy is a Radical Girl Scout. We must put a stop to her.
derpy is kind
05srsly im pissed as hell on my ISP right now
08,01Derpy is Element of Calamity
05RAEG
05>dubstep
05>not sure if lag or part of the song
^
What wrong with Derpy Hooves?
lmao
08,01Wrek: "we have replaced your internets with dubstep. all day. every day."
lol wrek
inb4 Derpy is replaced with Screwball using her propellor beanie to fly.
That'd be no fun.
08,01i think discord got to hasbro
08,01fucked up derpy
08,01+[yay]
so he's still alive
The cross-eyes are what hold all of Derpy's charm.
08,01i don't think the derp eyes are changed
oooo are we doing something now
08,01just the voice and the name
R.I.P Derpy Hooves 2010-2012. May the muffins be with you!
they are
Discord got out?
Shit.
08,01SonicRainboom: yes i di-- er, he did
Get my Orbital Friendship Cannon.
AND IIIIIIIIIII EE IIIII WILL ALWAYS LOOOOVE YOOOOOOOOOOU!!!
Twilight, grab my wub wubs
/me eats a bagel in honour of Derpy.
is the music laggy?
I know love and tolerate, but I'm seriously sick of how they always let the villian go.
a bit for me
What is he doing?
doom2?
lmao
AWW YEA
Honestly, I don't see why it's a huge deal with derpy.. She went back to the way she was before she became canon, minus the eye edit.
She is still canon
Dashie_Dashie: its a huge deal because if hasbro is willing to go back and change something that a very small minority supposedly complained about, they will go back and change everything
There will still be fanfics about her at least
zecora? the apparently african pony? she could easily be changed. Barking pony from the hospital? changed
Also, because she was "Different" :O
any number of things could be complained about, and all of them changed
go use rickroll doom!
Give all muffins and flowers to a grave of Derpy Hooves.
(Melissa Harris-Perry is having too much fun on her show. I'm glad I can watch her show Saturdays at 10am now)
also, as Snuffsis said, the complaint was apparently because shes different, if thats the case, thats beyond intolerant
I'm so shameless
dat doom music
I've got a better idea. Someone, go invent a muffin that explodes.
08,01Snuffsis: i love the anme
08,01*name
The name, of the picture?
i missed the part where equestria was a place where only cookie cutter perfect ponies could exist and everypony who happened to be different physically wasnt allowed
SonicRainboom: but Derpy LIKES muffins!
ah cool playing Doom
I <3 Derpy Hooves. Now he dead.
BFG 9000!
Ingwaz: it's Bridle Gossip IRL!
I bet someone working at Hasbro is eating a muffin right now without caring.
Derpy invented a muffin that's also child pony doctor.
08,01i don't believe in prayer, but... i will admit to maybe having wished upon a star to luna a time or two...
otakon: i dont get the reference?
Doom
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRv59GJVSlQ can we watch just this part of docter who and then thats it u have wat everyone else wants!! I mean it plz
Ingwaz: in Bridle Gossip everyone was afraid of Zecora for being different i.e. a Zebra.
08,01SonicRainboom: make life take the muffins back?
omg a mancubus on the very first level
The Twilight movie ruined Muffins for me forever.
Kirakura: it's a high difficulty mod.
ahh i see, bsically yes, derpy is different, so we fear what we do not understand
ultraviolence?
eeyup agains DEMONS!!!!!!
nice
nice, my little portal
perhaps we should get a group together for MM8BDM sometime
08,01Snuffsis: that was the sound of my brain imploding with adorableness
:D
is it just the itunes version that was changed?
The New Derpy Hooves at Hasbro? "Derpy Hooves X! with Old voice and name!"
LUNA
♥
Dashie_Dashie: we're unsure on that, hasbro has yet to clarify
imps still alive
if it was JUST itunes, then it wasn't hasbro behind it.
Sweetie Belle says SOUP.
apple hired their own editors to cover their ass against a lawshuit
revenants! omfg
lawsuit*
Hey people! Returning from speeds stack practice
i heard it was just the itunes version
Dashie_Dashie: indeed, but they have yet to say, and they've been silent the entire time this has been happening, so, no on knows but it does not look good on hasbro's part to keep everyone int he dark like this
Dashie_Dashie: atm yes. but we'll only know for sure when The Last Roundup is shown on TV again as a rerun.
So outside of TV and iTunes, she's still Derpy… man, f**k that
Reeeeeeeeeeeerun!!!!!!!!
Yay.
ThatsAShinySky: how'd it go, and what's Speed Stacks?
Shotguns now shoot lasers?
What?
this is boring something else plz
It went fine otakon.
i remember the DBZ Doom
i believe the last roundup is still available on my free dvr unchanged, but most likely they would not have changed it and just waited until it came around again
Tovler isn't that the way it used to be no offense
It's just basically stacking cups in specific combinations.
08,01i wish portal 2 had a Tourettes Core
^
You're back sky?! :O
oh I've heard of that before. I couldn't do that, I'm not quick enough
Who survived the first night on Minecraft?
alexxm: the problem is that theyre changing something because supposedly some people found it offensive because derpy was different
okay, brb need MOAR COFFEE
05oo
05minecraft
if theyre willing to do that, they'll change anything
05who's up for some?
no ammo's!
is it lagging for anyone else

The only mod you need it Technic Pack. :D

otakon: eenope.
and I have the "connection powered by cockney orphans, made of wood" as Meanwhile puts it.
otakon: Let's say that hypothetically, your phone can run Java. You run Minecraft on it.
i dislikke technic pack
Your phone would hate you forever.
i would join you guys, but i dont have minecraft, i'm not really a sandbox type of guy
didnt get permission off mod authors
Kammerjunk: omg, it CAN run Java
Wood from the future..
Wrek you're name is "Player" on MC

Punch me a tree!
How to join the server, if possible? :O
