lets walk INTO the desert, in the midle of the day... BRILLIANT!
grizzly bear tracks
Om: he would be interesting to go camping with :)
I mean granted it's salt water, but you can do things to separate the salt out. >_>
looks like whoof tracks...
that buffering
Live on water I can't.
Yeah, but Bear Grylls is ex Special Forces
Panda: Not if he monologs like that -_-
Bufferus maximus
That's why he's so badass
^
Panda: if you went camping with him, I'm sure that you would be in for one hell of a trip, lol
05i cant follow his dialogue
Sylandest: And what's wrong with that?
Om: i have stream muted :) and ill bring music
05too much buffer cap'n!
Sylandest1: :) i know, would be fun though...
Water that's take to it the brountain to the miles trek
Ikr~ So much buffering~
Everlasting_Joy: nothing at all! It'd be quite exciting is my point! :D
>ex Special Force
>went crazy from drinking his own piss; resigned.
No wake it it without water HQ
Dat buffer
Roll after wheat.
Panda: I'm not sure what you consider camping if you can mute the stream xD
ALL THE BUFFER!
Panda: I say go for it if you get the chance
This is like a youtube poop.
bear grylls?
Hate to break it to you, dari, but Bear was caught "cheating" on these little survival expeditions years ago. :P
Hey guys brb im going to bring up 2 chatrooms 1 on the wii and my computer cause for the nickname on the wii its going to be P#ANUTSMUGGLER and my usaul gamertag name for this one so brb
^
Just curious, anyone ever play the Megaman Starforce games or Battle Network games?
I can't even understand him at this point. He just says random words, buffers, and repeats :D
No he wasn't
Meanwhile: :D Now that you mention it.
That was a bullshit media story
has be drank piss yet?
Bear Grylls is now splicing
Om: you just have to learn how to mute real life ;)
Panda: Rub some bacon on it?
He just needs a little Glitter!
And then made up a load of bullshit
He didn't cheat on anything.
Better?
Much :)
05dari's custom ytp's :P
Physcially impaired 50% but I keep movin use your motorboat you can frighten this seed.

ALL THEBUFFER
Er, according to the stories I read, the news channel actually confirmed it.
need to go! btw check this out! http://fav.me/d547kyo
Every day I'm buffering
Er, the channel that hosts his show confirmed it, rather.
I can't even tell what Bear is trying to accomplish with that snake :/
SNAAAAKE
So are they lying too? >_>
Take out men puff adder or people any other snake.
It's a Sporedotcom YTP.

Sounds like "One bite will disinfect a shark"
Petrified_Discord: piss on it, of course
and then Crab Battle
well... vhanging the Lightbulb caused my PC to shut down... :/
Snake? SNAKE!!
Lil_B: welcome back
SNAAAAAKE :'(
Beat a snake with a stick
is this lagging for anyone?
Now eat it.
05Sundaysmile yes
Sylandest: Or in it, most likely. Then he can drink out of it later

:O
nom nom nom
(See him eating snake raw). . . I'd do that.
Om, thats a very peculiar way to mute life, but... bacon is the answer to anything :)
Everlasting_Joy: apparently snakes are good to eat
Hey, don't have to believe me, go google it if you don't. Either way I don't care. I still get enjoyment out of this guy's absurd show. :p
It's not true CK
Panda: Everything?
I heard about the story ages ago
Om well..... nearly everyting
05dari: switch to limeV mayhaps?
Panda: Awww :(
MORE LAG FOR THE LAG GOD
Panda and Om: what we cant answer with bacon, we answer with 42
Om: i mean it cant cure cancer, that we know of
"Day 3. Stream still buffering really badly. I'm not sure what to do anymore. I'm running low on piss to drink. I'm going to have to punch some sharks soon if I want to survive."
More buffer for the buffer throne
Tastes like eating delish
Petrified_Discord: rofl
Sylandest1: :) really?
Panda: Maybe they havent used enough?
http://i.imgur.com/uvPon.jpg
my chat derped
Panda: but of course! :)
Sylandest: 42 pices of bacon
M Bison : Of course!
Raw snake with a glass of chardonnay... yes that means piss
instead of mlp we watch bear grylls
Om Sylandest1 I think.... im gonna go 10 years in the medical field just so i can rub bacon on cancer, lets hope i dont get sued for malpractice xD
SHIT DOUBLE BUFFERING
its the stream lagging, not the video
"Let's try this." Immediate buffering.
ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE SKY
omnipony: Ofc!!
buffers within buffers!
The video was lagging
Panda: Good idea!
much better dari
Om: YES!
bufferception!!!!
Yay!
Pertified: Now you're in the spirit of the show!
Panda: nah, you'll do fine! :D
http://inception.davepedu.com/

Deadly cacti semen

No, they weren't...
Damn!
Well it depends on what you mean by faked any way.

its the white flued from the Tree in "The Fauntain"!
The bear attack?
He made me go to bed and got pissy when I went to get something to drink
05the cacti milk corroded his throat and stomach
Dat carcass.
alexxm: It's what's coming up, you'll see it.
Dat carcASS

So how does he know what mosquito repelent tastes like?
Keledo looks like a interesting pokemon
Everlasting_Joy: My survival instinct doesn't extend far beyond "I'm hungry, think I'll order pizza"
Panda: The windy lady did.
Probably means tastes like the smell of it
Panda: Seems legit *joins the equalists*
Suddenly crome
Petrified_Discord: WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Ninjazz: Sleep well!

Quick, get some pepper!
Robots don't have to worry about food, water, or that stuff.

Everlasting_Joy: i wouldnt know if yoou did silly
You might think this is a cactus. But it isn't.
Wow, a cactus.
Nope chuck testa
Rule Nr X of the wildness: Never drink water thats crystal clear
If it's white and milky, don't drink it.
Spectrum_Rush: True, but you know what I mean.
Ow
Om, Panda: I...I...I didnt get to say goodbye...
Lil_B: Why?

Everlasting_Joy: indeed
Meanwhile: lul
Sylandest: That hurts mang...

DED
How cheery
That story has got to be fake.
:(
then who was phone?

Have you ever read the disclaimer at the start of each episode CK|Catnap?
dat parkour jump doe!
Coins! Coins everywhere!
Dollar bush <3.
Nom
is that bear grylls on livestream????
yes
Malavolent that often means that something is in this water that prevents other animel or microorganisms to life in there (poison or too much salt) so you shouldn't drink it as well
Spy: yep!
Does it say anything about how parts of the show are bullshitted in order to make the show look more dramatic? :P
Bear Grylls and the crew receive support when they are in potentially life threatening situations, as required by health and safety regulations. On some occasions, situations are presented to Bear so he can demonstrate survival techniques. Professional advice should always be sought before entering any dangerous environment."
lol
well it's no coconut but its good enough
12back
Suddenly disclaimer
ta-da
and wall of text
it's all fake
dat disclaimer :D
13front
bear grylls bears all
See, second sentence.
>_>
13c:
12side
Some of the situations that come up are set up so he encounters them, but the way he deals with them is real.
12to
12side
12:3
Fuck that shit, Imma go fight some tiger sharks!
Lies and deciet!
Not only that, but would we want Bear dead? I think not.

GilDash: Ello der
/me hugs GilDash
Better drink my own piss. :S
when did this happennn
GilDash: howdy! :) *hugs*
LOL HOT
Dari: Setting up the situation and then "reactions are real"? Sounds like a typical reality show.
12><::::::::::::::
hey GilDash hows your day been
NY is an oven right now
Bullshit
MEh, fake or not, I still like watching this sutff :)
!w 11754
GilDash: hello, you should... dammit you typed it before me
Kings Park, NY: Mostly Cloudy and 87°F(31°C)
12^^^
And those are real right?
Setting it up so in his path there is a river he has to cross
13it happened the day you became a pancake :D
but.....i wanted to chat about ponies...not bear grylls :'(
Panda: hehe, too slow on the draw there :D
And he makes a raft to cross it
Isnt most of wresteling fake?
12I stepped outside for a moment
And has to deal with crocodiles on the way across
I de-flatted myself
numbnuts
Sylandest1: there is a first time for anything huh?
12and my leg started melting
also yeah
They might have fixed it so he has to cross that river
13YOU'RE STILL A PANCAKE TO MEEE
But the way he does it is real
f*** outside
Yeah, its not like they give him a raft :D
Not some stage bullshit
12^^
Wanna eat me, AE?
Panda: aye...that was the first time i didnt get to say bye to Nin for example
12omai
Panda: Around me, I always catch first place. ;)
/me runs
LOL
/me hides
xD
13also LOL at your hot weather
So its semi legit?
So if you're saying that what he does isn't real, that's shut idiotic
13so just because I can
Plain and simple.
Sylandest: Ninjazz was just on? :(
13!weather Scarborough, UK

13;D
evil england
Crimson-Dragon its more like the matches are predetimened but the moves can hurt or injure if they're done wrong
13u jelly
He has real knowledge, which he demonstrates to us.
12;-;
GilDash: yeah he just left :(
very
I didn't say EVERYTHING isn't real.
GilDash: he just left for the day :( I didnt get to say goodbye either
12DO WANT
take me with you
GilDash: And he wont be on for a while. He is on a plane
;w;
what is he doing?
I said that parts of the show are faked.
12I'll trade!
13Sure but you gotta get yourself over here yourself :3c
xD
Om: A plane? A plane to where?
all this is filmed in a studio
The Sand-bushmen walk single-file to hide their numbers
Nothing is 'faked'
O.o
/me steals 63 degree F weather
GilDash: he's going to the states for a time
GilDash: See reletives here in the states
13:<
GilDash Ninjazz just went off, hes a way for some time now, but trys to come online when he can
Om: wait what
As I said, they might set it up so he has to encounter a certain obstacle.
But the way he deals with it is real.
no edible bugs in the states
Not fake.
this is real, my uncle knows this guy
Panda: What?
and these blaster marks, too accurate for sand-bushmen, only imperial troopers are so accurate :)
I wish there was a way to like
displace the heat
So, Ninjazz is going to the states. Fair does.
earthworms are edible Derpy_pony
NINJAZZ DIDNT TELL ME HE WAS LEAVING FOR A WHILE! :[ Om im le sad
So the north was equally cold
Storm troopers are accurate?
Ryunosuke: Imperial troopers? Accurate?
/me hugs Panda
The Equator equally humid
etc
:U
/me shrugs
And again, setting up the scenario and allowing people to deal with it "real" is how reality shows can claim they are "real life"
What bullshit are you speaking?
12heh
/me hugs Alchemist
05y u persist to imply its fake CK|Catnap?
oops
Panda: He will have internet at times.
Panda: Hey, I haven't seen him in a couple of days...
:);):D:P:(:$:O:|:'(:S:[<36_9
Om: :(
GilDash: well i talked to him last night ;)
SPY IN IN THE BASE
Dat emote spam
/me hugs GilDash
yay smiley faces
Spy: Warned you about that...
/me hugs Sylandest1.
Did anyone kill a red spy on the way here?
05Spy no emote spam
Panda: Well aren't you peachy. :|
13mabe we could somehow balance out the temperature difference between us so we can both have 24C or something? :'D
GilDash: well, we'll just have to keep each other occupied while we watch for him, hmm?
I want to see him scream for help in delirium because he lost his water reserve
aw but emote spam is preeetty
I talk to im everyday?
these things happen
derpy_pony: :|
Sylandest1: I think I can handle that...
Om: Do you go to work when you have to? Got nothing better to do...
Ok so my wii console doesn't have java script cause it won't show some of the stuff
I'm so thirty now... better drink my own water
Lil_B: :).
Wrek: Like I said, I don't deny parts are probably legit, but other parts are faked. Or staged, if you prefer. Point is that the show does have some portions that are set up for him for the sake of making the show informative.
GilDash: What?
thirsty
12._.
05staged is a better word than faked
xD
Lil_B: Dat typo.
Om: Sorry, more Megadeth. \m/
Oh no, they've set it up so that he has to climb the highest peak in Namibia.
cold earth
:U
oh wait no
that'd be hot
So clearly that's all fake and needs no skill or strength at all
05but i think arranged is a better word right?
And is absolute bullshit
12LOWER
CK|Catnap: That sounds different to what you were originally saying.
or warm IDK
GilDash: I see. You like that group of musical artists :S
well LL
why does he HAVE to climb a mountain? :)
I love Bear
we need tropics to stay tropic
the leopard didn't eat him again
ok now im going to bring up another chatroom on my computer hang on real quick
12yush
or the plant life there will die
05Rain: i met him irl :D
COME AT ME BRO :[
plus we lose beach babes
;A;
CK|Catnap: It's like saying nuclear fission in an nuklear power station is faked because it's set up and happens under controlled circumstances...
Om: Megadeth could be better described as Dave Mustane with backing musicians. :D
pootea
/me RUNS
GilDash: um... im always peachy :(
12but NY needs to chill ou-
Random Trivia: There is a Bar in Namibya called "Blitzkrieg-Bunker"

>A>
13LOL JK they're full of chavs and fat women
Bear is my hero!
GilDash: OH, right. Cuse I understand that reference :$
Aaaand now that I've got four different people arguing with me over whether a partially faked show is partially faked, I think I'll just shut up. >_>
HAHA
that sucks
He's so English :).
05it was on the end of a world scout camp here in sweden. on the last night on the big stage he dropped in with a parachute.
they make this tea only for tourists
Panda: U be fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine Mm mmh
12thats national pride for you :"D
Panda: It was a joke. :D
doesnt one of demomans domination clips say anything about "soupcan"?
/me hides
You clearly don't know the meaning of faked.
XD~
Random Trivia: Namibia translated means something along the lines of "Land with nothing on it"
bushmen trolled bear
*!
also people who say he is fake because sinarios are set up for him are just stupid
Hi everypony
Because nothing in this show is faked
13You have a hair on your chin :D
GilDash: :) yayy
Om: No, but that's why I'm teaching you. :)
howdy, MegaMoonShine!
Wrek: scout? camp?... were you a Boy scout
hey MegaMoonShine hows your day been
Parts of it might be set up
"you can live off of it, but it tastes like shit" )
But nothing is fake.
12lolwat

http://derpy.me/2NCUG this picture makes me smile
Dari: Or you're not willing to admit the possibility of any portion of the show being faked.
GilDash: Oh. Well alright, that makes sense I guess.

Tactical lagnuke inbound!
Refreshing the page
*Peanut Butter has joined chat*
Sylandest1: Same old, same old. I've found a toll road I'm thinking of using on the way back as it cuts 20+ minutes off of the traffic.
Ping
hey Peanut hows your day been
him climbing a near vertical clif in the rain is fake because someone told him there was a good cave at the top?
GilDash: oooh, nice! How much is the toll though?
05Rain: it was the same afterparty Europe held a live performance

Good i just brought up 2 chatrooms on my computer

Always wanted to meet him.
Om: we all do
Internet fight!
Om, we all do.
Sylandest1: It's better then being sat in traffic for a half hour.
Om: he died?
Om: I know that feel bro
And for the third time, not going to argue with the entire channel over something so stupid. At least have the politeness to stop arguing when I stop, please.
whos streaming?
GilDash: aye, I'd be bored out of my skull if I was stuck for a half hour in traffic. I'd start leaping over cars or something XD
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG3: Dari.
ah
nice straw
Well I think it's rude to call it fake when he's actually doing all of this.
Where did he get that straw from lol
He had a part in Finding Nemo, before he died. They cut it out obviously
Sylandest1: That's why I bring my best metal CD's. :D
13did somebody say weird?
13solve this:

The argument in a nutshell http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2459/

GilDash: hehe, nice! Knowing me I'd be packing a book or maybea portable dvd player even XD
GilDash: Mettle head :D

spoiler: he will die by stingray poisoning
>porcupine

It's a porcupine Crimson-Dragon
where did he get the shovel?
They are not the same thing
BAT
that's so funny I forgot to laugh
The bushmen brought the shovel
Sylandest1: The problem is it isn't quite still traffic. It's moving, just really slowly, so eyes have to be on the road. :S
12the nose knows
He used two sticks and stone to make it
13its meant to be not funny
they have a hardware store in their camp
dat ass
lol
ew anti-jokes
Spikes.

Cube

Reach in there and pull it out by the legs.
LOL NEW MSN

Of course pizza is a vegetable. Also peanut butter is a vitamin.
Italian pizza is best pizza
GilDash: Im more into stuffed crust :P
GilDash: and without tons of shit on it :D

Scientist are cruel

Dis
This
03god dang I can't type right now
Meanwhile: sand tower wont help agaisnt spiders tho
GilDash: I figured you would find it cute :D
wouldve been 20% better if it didnt include skyrim
07I thought you were gonna go to the boardwalk
Bronysith: Skyrim is what makes it good :p
03apparently not o.o
twilight_sprinkle: It does when you build a house on top of it.
6freeway
6either 101 or 1
I can not stand this song. >_<
ACS13123: skyrim is the lamest game of 2011 along with COD MW3 and BF3
6oh right
03yeah I dunno
07from santa cruz, it's 1 isn't it
6so are you guys flying to LA?
It's a very nice PMV otherwise though.
03no
03we're driving
03:P
GilDash: I kinda like it >_>;
6...
.... y would u say that bronysith
6which route
Meanwhile: spiders can still get up
03no idea
Why it fits so well? http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l273/BlackFox_02/thecheatrave.gif
GilDash: the music is good for me but the message in it nope
6ok ask your parents
twilight_sprinkle: Spiders can't get over lips.
Bronysith: At least Skyrim was more entertaining than CoD
03"Capitola next 3 exits"
GilDash: either that or sexy :D
03we just passed
6being from the area, I might be able to uh
SirGanjalf: i miss homestar
6save your butts
Bronysith: TBH, I like those games, I dont see why they're taken the piss of so much *COUGH COUGH MW3 kids COUGH COUGH*
03we're on freeway 1 right now
03is what my mom said
And BF3 wasnt bad
6yeah 1 is pretty
03honestly all we do is punch addresses in the GPS
03:P
oh god Homestarrunner
6ask them what highway they're taking to LA though
ACS13123: cause it is the same exact game every single year
03honestly all we do is punch addresses in the GPS <- this
6I wouldn't be surprised if you take 101/PCH
killerpony7733: I wouldn't know. I always mute the stream everytime its on.
03whatever highway it tells us to
6since tourists tend to
You know what upsets me?
Meanwhile: hm, they can cross the lips from ground to wall
Bronysith: BF3 and MW3 are COMPLETELY different
MW3 is the definition of cashcow
Soooooooo potentially three more months til new MLP episodes
GilDash: Fair enough
00,03GilDash :(
Sequels arent made due to how a game plays
6I-5 is faster, but it's literally 4-5 hours of nothing
its how much it sells
07101 is a much better drive down to LA anyways
twilight_sprinkle: They can't climb upside down.
Irish_Pony: I could reply with great detail to that, but I won't.
6plus, it's ridiculously hot
ACS13123: i mean every year COD is released the same exact game every year
Scoot-Scootaloo: Don't listen to that sour puss
Scoot-Scootaloo: Hey, nothing personal. I just really dislike the song. :$
6it was 113 on sunday, and I was stuck in an hour of traffic
GilDash: Please? :(
so a shitty game that sells like CoD will get sequel AFTER SEQUEL AFTE SEQUEL
07and once you're as far down as monterey, I think it's faster
Scoot-Scootaloo: As I said, the actual video is fantastic. :)
HEY EVERYPONY! :)
6so, I'd reccommend 101 even though it's stupidly long
Scoot-Scootaloo: do i need to smack someone? who made you cry"?
Meanwhile: you sure about that? i think i mightve seen it
03I think we're doing 101
6wait, you're staying in monterey?
YES!
YES
03if that's the one along the ocean
at least skyrim tried putting new stuff
Yet the good games dont get anything because of "sales"
wool"
THIS!
03nah

So is it on ground or constantly in flight?
Oh noes, WoW talk again. Don't take me wrong, I used to be a hardcore player, but WoW is pretty much a joke now and not worth anyone's time, imo

How would it effect you?
GilDash: wut?
welcome to my world Junh

Meanwhile: Such a simple thing, of knowing the importance of what you really think you want, is the things you miss the most, but if you have no focus on your life's things, what deems your time worthy of being with it?
The lack of SuperBrony64 is starting to concern me...
Bunny_Maid_Luna: Oh, mine would never kill anything. He's too damned dopey and soft for that. We keep saying that if someone broke in, he'd either run off or sit there and demand to be petted. :D

Legally Blonde reference?
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Barbie's line, "Authority should derive from the consent of the governed, not from threat of force!" is based on a quote from Thomas Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence. "Governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed." But it is also a nod to Michael Palin's line in Monty Python and the Holy Grail: "Supreme
1,11executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony!"

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: By the time Toy Story 3 was made, Pixar animators had figured out how to animate things like water and fur. Although being able to realistically animate fur was originally a concern for Toy Story 3 animators, the real animation challenge was trying to animate the trash bags in the movie. Because trash bags have special properties such as how it reflects light,
1,11animators spent weeks trying to get the trash bags correct.

The other day my aunt accused me of going through a second childhood cause I collect MLP toys and I politely told that is impossible because I never left my first childhood :D
I CRIED MANLY TEARS
I SHALL CRY...WHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: At the end of the original Toy Story, Rex said he hoped Andy would get another dinosaur, preferably a "leaf eater" so he could act as the dominant carnivore. In Toy Story 3 he gets his wish because his new owner, Bonnie, has Trixie.
/me high fives Shizuka

Evil Doctor Porkchop is best pig.

Calcos323 it will damn it! :'(
Ooooooo
oh god the references touch my heart
If i was writing this, the movie would end with Andy taking the toys back from the little girl, telling her "YOU'RE PLAYING WITH THEM WRONG!"
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: A piece of concept art found in the book 'The Art of Toy Story 3' shows that originally, Trixie the blue dinosaur was envisioned to be part of Lotso's gang at the daycare center. However, in the final movie she is one of Bonnie's toys and is a friendly character.
Rexie x Trixie is now canon
thiose aliens are collectors items
05gotta watch buzz lightyear the movie again

Isn't it implied that Trixie is made from the same company as Rex
Pizza Planet is now closed :'(

Heart melting in 3...2... *RRRIP* Oh...it blooms. My heart's a flower now...

Agreed 4 is too many, Star Wars has 4 (then 6), Indy has 4, but Toy Story and BTTF are the blacksheeps of 4s.
Silverscreen what about Star Wars?
1,11~yay~
everyone spam yay
PaladinDrakkenwolf: awwww

12yes
Silverscreen: The Godfather? Back to the future?
dat Dashie wingboner

YAY
BTTF had a 4th?
oops
that doesn't count it was a porady
BTTF has ONLY three movies
I can't read
Unless contemporary tastes change and TS4 is made after a huge time skip to reflect those tastes.
Irish_Pony: Don't forget "The LAst Crusade
Yeah
SlurryMoon: Can we have a moment of silence for him?
IshBestBullseye: Starwars is a 7 part series. When he mean trilogy he means a series with only 3
I suppose the videogame doesn't count as the fourth Back To The Furture film
No Hasbro toys were licensed in the making of this film.
SlurryMoon: damn really?

I'm going to take a guess
ohai slurry OC
1,11Starwars, Godfather and Back to the Future all had some issues in one way or another in at least one of their films. Toy Story had a solid plot throughout all three films.
Even better than the Ocean's Trilogy
Ghosties had you not seen it before?
How about LotR?
IshBestBullseye: Ethier I am worng or there where lots of starwars
STOP YAYING!
The current streamer is totally... Wrek.
Best trillogy ever, two hoofs down!
god father 3 was crappy
11,01Ghosties: What movie?
zoo
04That was the first time I ever saw the film
04Toy Story 3
BttF was great besides 3 was meh
awww
K_A: no its Tom
more Yays
What do you expect from a time travel movie trilogy, Silverscreen?
Ghosties for a family film it is incredibly heavy
|Discord| then you're wrong
Im going to sleep good night everypony :)
05ping?
Ghosties: You like? :3
So, what's the next trilogy to be streamed?
Ghosties: :O
Okay, I should go now.
Rainbow: Godpony Part3 :)
DocSane: Terminator
04It doesn't get heavy until the end
you actually felt for the toys and the kid
G'night Sakari.
Well Ghosties I hope you enjoyd it
ish
Wrek: I was saying the streamer was totally you.
Suddenly slurry OC -lol
They had an ad campaign with "Take your toys to college"
night Sakari
huh?
@lunac Lol
04I did like it
BECAUSE THERE ARE ONLY 3 TERMINATOR FILMS
modern films dont let you get that attatched
if we did Star wars would we do all 6 or just a single trilogy?
04I shed three tears
Cya Sakari!
:'(
Could be Godfather or BTTF, you'll never know.
SALVAWHATNOW?
is it looping?
Me, too, Fluttershy
there's a trailer for it on You Tube Rainbow
11,01It isn't sad.
3one sec, trying to set up the shorts
1,11Toy Story also had a great overlaying story and message about growing up, which was a hell of a thing to learn and it enabled itself to grow with its audience.
13RAWRity: you mean two
IshBestBullseye: THere where 5 different starwars
yep
May I suggest we watch "The Pixar Story" documentary as well? =) It's acctually a great documentary for history about Pixar, Disney and animation in general
11,01Don't forget the parody.
is that pic getting bigger
I usually save this for Friday, so watching this without a pony ep following is a bit surreal.
04That's the most they'll get out of me, I refuse to outright b'aww
It should be on youtube
Whats next?
|Discord| there was one trilogy, thats all there ever was
Shorts
Nittany_Discord: this movie was not meant for parodys :'(
Silverscreen it was incredibly well timed for the kids that grew up with one and 2, were leaving home about the time of 3
IshBestBullseye: Nope look it up
oh
And then Ghosties cried after signing off
04I've only outright b'aww'd for one work, and that was Metal Gear Solid 4, had me crying like a babe

11,01Not a Toy Story parody.
hi IshBestBullseye *hugs* :3
|Discord| all evidence otherwise is just lies
/me 11,01hasn't cried in years...or decades.
8,6Ghosties shed 3 tears, but failed to mention there were because he stubbed his toe
