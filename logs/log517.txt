Okay, before I go, is there a stinger?
BEST THING I HAVE SEEN! 9000000000/10 :')
A STINGER
3They did however make some Toy Story Toons
12nini-OMG typo in-game!
Time for the theme
Time for the gym!!
I actually cna't remember if there's a stringer here
Bbl!
12"They're leader's finished"
Is there a STINGER.
stinger*
... No.
lets watch em all again right bucking now :D
AT LEAST PIXAR CAN COUNT TO THREE..... VALVE!
and then they all go eat Schwarma
3I'll be showing the one that played before Cars 2
ended too strong? I thought sequals ended when the response was weak?
Pixar beeter then Diosney even to it;s own employees
HEH
11,01Milk it too much.
brb
ended too strong emotionally
Rainbow: Woe is us
you cant sequal this
stay outta my butt you kids
i everyone :)
See ya everypony. Have to go for today. Night.
stay outta my plot
hi*
real genius ends it when its right
it would be like milking Aliens
th
there's no way to follow this movie up without ruining the entire franchise
I can't feel my heart anymore
...
Fluttershy, of course
:)
1,11~yay~
12yes
BTTF had a 4th?
oops
that doesn't count it was a porady
BTTF has ONLY three movies
I can't read
Unless contemporary tastes change and TS4 is made after a huge time skip to reflect those tastes.
Yeah
3Steve Jobs was president of Pixar in 95 if you didn't know
I suppose the videogame doesn't count as the fourth Back To The Furture film
dat jazz
wow
11,01Zoo
11,01Zoo
11,01Zoo
Story wars was always going to be 6 once he used episode 4 in the title
11,01Zoo
04Now I get it
ZOO
11,01Zoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
zoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Star Wars is 7 parts?
11,01Zoo zoo zoo
6
BEST MOVIE EVAR
In which universe?
no
doesnt count
NO
I'm going to take a guess
1,11Starwars, Godfather and Back to the Future all had some issues in one way or another in at least one of their films. Toy Story had a solid plot throughout all three films.
How about LotR?
STOP YAYING!
Best trillogy ever, two hoofs down!
zoo
04That was the first time I ever saw the film
04Toy Story 3
BttF was great besides 3 was meh
awww
more Yays
05ping?
Okay, I should go now.
Rainbow: Godpony Part3 :)
you actually felt for the toys and the kid
Suddenly slurry OC -lol
huh?
04I did like it
BECAUSE THERE ARE ONLY 3 TERMINATOR FILMS
modern films dont let you get that attatched
if we did Star wars would we do all 6 or just a single trilogy?
04I shed three tears
:'(
Could be Godfather or BTTF, you'll never know.
SALVAWHATNOW?
is it looping?
Me, too, Fluttershy
there's a trailer for it on You Tube Rainbow
11,01It isn't sad.
3one sec, trying to set up the shorts
13RAWRity: you mean two
yep
11,01Don't forget the parody.

04That's the most they'll get out of me, I refuse to outright b'aww
Whats next?
Shorts
