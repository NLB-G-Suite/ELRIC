Also, where is this main stream you speak of? (Not mainstream but the non-Friday stream).
how rude
They don't sell prepaids out there?
Well that kind of sucks hard.
Although constantly posting images can strike some ire from the mods as well.
....did that tank just drive up the stairs?
Hello my Minnesotan friend even though I don't know you (yet).
i thought it was a vid
That pretty much happens to all of us :/
it'S also a 4chan link
sorry :P
Maybe you can get others from the forums to join us :P
lol
oh

Whose presently streaming?
idk I just read some random posts, they might have been old
Oh alright
Oh, any stream then. Okay!
/me is inharently not a nice person
the theaters are just the chatrooms
We are just trying to keep this place alive :)
But right now all the chatrooms are the same right?
We do have regulars coming here now.
hard when you don't have a wide audience
DEM SUNGLASSES :D
right now yes
I think its because we haven't been targeting the skylanders audience
Is this room still open during movie night?
Yes
Haven't played any of it lol
^:S
no differance between the theaters aside from movie nights then they're just different chats
I stopped after Dawn
you see the room youre in down there in the tabs. #bronystate is the mainroom
heard it's fun though
I'm assuming that until the skylanders fans find out we are here, it probably wont change much in this place
It's Gamecube. :P
Yes I am :P
after that I got enticed by my buds to play TOR
