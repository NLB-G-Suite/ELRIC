00,10wreky has been flying them for some time
Er 9.0
Sumica: put that instead of Twilight :D
The inside view flying this thing is so nausiating

Ya know... I thought wreks voice was a little more gruff... but... its kinda soothing with this music XD

Oh yeah, that too.

this song seems familiar
Wrek must have dual screens or one large screen.

I'm guessing dual screens. One for the game and the othe for observing the chat
oh right
star craft
DOY
XD
Who doesn't run dual monitors these days.
Jmo I dont
I could never go back to a single monitor ;~;
I don't either
Jmo I dont have a need for it ^^ I'm distracted as it is :)
i either need 2 monitors or 1 huge one
Jmo: I have dual monitors, but that's because I have two computers. :P
i can just get more shit done with 2
Oh you demona.
and when i mean get shit done. you know what i mean
MUHAHAHAH
There's not enough room in my sister's place for a desktop.
And the one monitor is the whole computer. LOl XD
Furniture in my room takes up all the space so there's little walking room
Wrek, you a dick XD
Climb on the walls.

exactly!!!!!
So is that Wrek's real face we're seeing in the upper right corner?
yes
Yep

So the icons in the lower right of the screen... they indicate rage and "choice" words? =P
Dunno?
I signed up for the beta a long while ago and i haven't gotten a invite at all
They should be sending out more. They just wiped the servers
Last friday?
Also it helps if you had an account and played the first one too.
I doubt i'll get any key but if i do yay but i'm not setting my hopes high
Eh. Anything that gets done right now gets reset anyways. It will be f2p on launch so you will get to play for sure.
Just a matter of time
Maybe
Wow
So much lag.
Hello
Hi FiMFlamFilosophy :)
Hey FiMFlamFilosophy
ello FiMFlamFilosophy
Hiyo FiMFlamFilodophy
Love the videos from that channel XD
If I were to play as Soldier from TF2, what weapons do you recommend (Primary, Secondary, etc.)?
hi FiMFlamFilosophy
hi
AJIsAwesome|Tired: you would want to play the Heavy class. They are more akin to the Engi class from BF3 though.
hey guys
Except.. minus the repairs, and the Heavy in PS2 gets an extra shield
Hi alexxm
AJIsAwesome|Tired: Just use default weapons at first
Hm....seems interesting. Considering that I'm new to TF2, I would use Soldier since he seems simple to use.
Hi, alexxm :)
hi alexxm :)
Honestly though just starting out AJIsAwesome|Tired I would recommend either light assault or medic, better survivability all around for those classes
hi
Okay. Thanks.
Light assualt can get C4 for pretty cheap too
how are things AJIsAwesome|Tired thelonepony and Applejack2011
Pretty good. How about you, alexxm?
great alexxm and you?
I'm fine
who thinks im an imposter
Hm?
i'm good thelonepony
Huh, it's only $40 to get instant access...
'Tis a shame I need to get a computer that is capable of running this game.
FiMFlamFilosophy Thing is when using a name of someone popular in a said community and since this site has a easy ability to change nicks it's very doubtful due to how easy it is try and act like said person
You can be everyone on the internet

back to the randy newman song:
hey everyone
Heya trollhunter
/me (cue Short People)
I am digging this music.
what we watching
Planetside 2.
I should probably buy this game some time.
how much is it?
05f2p
O:
05but if you want isntant beta access
0540 bucks
Aw damn :D
Which is about £25
05(those 40 bucks will give you a shitlaod of ingame stuff at launch)
Wrek Should I buy it and then save up for a better computer?
05yeh
05to test if you can run it ;O
/me has no money and feels bad man.
True.
Wish games would do performance demos, only something small to see if your computer can handle the full game.
Well, ain't that a kick in the head.
I'll go see how much is in my bank.
I know what's in my bank. Approximately squat diddle.
Or diddly-squat.
DashWithRainbows I could easily buy this game with all the money from my birthday but idunno not sure with this game as of yet. Plus i have no beta access so i can't really decide
Well, Wrek has told me quite a bit of what the game contains and I can only say that it would be a worthy purchase if you love FPS's.
no stream?
Streams on for me
ok
Getting some buffers on my end but that is due to me playing C&C:TA as well.
DashWithRainbows Oh C&C 3 right?
Aye, Command and conquer 3: Tiberium alliance :3
Used to play a whole lot of Generals.
I still do.
Then I forgot where I put the disc.
DashWithRainbows Damn i want to play multiplayer with ya!
And when I see disc, I mean virtual copy.
say*
killerpony7733 Well, if you see me playing C&C3 on steam, just hit me up with a message
We can do some comp stomps :3
DashWithRainbows Got kanes wrath?
Consarnit, why is tea so good.
05those that can should gett planetside 2
05asap
051st battalion broyn brigade needs more people
Nah, had it on Xbox though.
Wrek I'm checking my bank as we type.
just by looking it i can tell i will not be able to run it
DashWithRainbows Well....i could buy a copy of kanes wrath for ya
Nah, don't.
DashWithRainbows Alright :)
13http://i.imgur.com/flhDB.jpg
I liked it but I prefer the original.
Lol, Shizuka :D
30 EUR? Not so bad. Might buy it next month.
People would go with Black Hand and just spam Purifiers.
Shizuka well thats one way of dealing with kids
Shizu a worker must love kids
Shizuka I see that they forgot the spikes at the bottom.
tsk tsk.
Must be a rookie.
I usually went with Zocom or GDI.
hi
Welp, it's decided then. Soon, Planetside will be MINE.
hi flutterbrony
DashWithRainbows I used zocom, steel talons, Chosen of kane, etc and the reaper faction in scrin god reaper was god damn powerful
Well, I've got £31 in the bank, enough for that instant access :3
im back
:O is it thursady?
Nope.
lol
It's Wednesday.
:(
soo
How 'bout them apples?
i like apples
DashWithRainbows Well if my internet keeps up should have C&C 3 downloaded within a hour and a half
How about that local sports team?
I like pears more than apples
Nice one.
Apples are good. Sour apples are best.

I wish I was any good in shooter games >.>
Takes time to get used to the controls.

mentallyeffedguy Wrek is playing it on the stream. Alpha squad bonus basically gives you some awesome stuff when the full game is released.
so the game is planetside 2, i though it was battlefield XD
oh you were? how long ago was it?
This place changed admins a few times this year, mostly because the channel became unregistered
mentallyeffedguy: Battlefield has no sci fi :D
There is a sci fi Battlefield MadSurge
MadSurge: they have one sci fi game
back
ekips: mybe, but this is not battlefield anyway
MadSurge why'd you ask :$

Sorry, I should probably stop being derpy and just go read up on the site.
Don't know who that is :p

donutpop365: also, don't put up video links during streams
PONYPOKEY IS AWESOME
Oh, so they default to here any other day.
Okay.

apparently nobody else gets yelled at for that
Pony that pokey some where else please. There are children in the room.

nice tie
bai CCCP
cya CCCP
Oh, so it's not majority then, thanks!
Have you decided wether or not to do Ultramarine dash yet Wrek?
Seems nice.
Shizuka: i get it :D
Er. wat?
Wait a minute.
fahrenheit sucks!
Let me look at that again.
Well, I mean more people choosing the same thing ups the probability, but it's not based on majority.
Twighlight moment :P
Planet loading screen 2
lol
I guess he is preparing to fly?
like a boss Wrek
Barbetos|AtWork: one might think that
Dovah: What's the joke/
*?
Fly into the DANGER ZONE
dat sc2 terran soundtrack
AJIsAwesome|Tired: look at the high temps
donutpop365: there are also limits to what you can chose. has to be at least 6 months fora movie to be replayed, and one movie is a high-budget and/or have good ratings, whereas as b movie is a cult movie
Okay
now he only needs to fire off random dropship quotes during the game
NOW I get it. :D
donutpop365: a vs b is pretty confusing though, at times. theres more on the faq
brb, going to reheat some food
Speaking of food, brb.
Obsidian: so we'll be flying towards the enemy, into what you could call, a zone...
Pretty much
Obsidian: And that zone, is filled with danger...
so, violence, cursing and 3+. seems legit
Alright then, looking at the backlog seems useful.
Not to mention discrimination twilight_sprinkle.
ah, so thats what the third one is
twilight_sprinkle: Its fun for the whole family!
lol :D
twilight_sprinkle: WOAH! What's a movie in the C category?
donutpop365: i think thats WMC-worst movie clause
probably homevideo
Oh and that reminds me of this pony http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110301021551/mlp/images/thumb/b/b1/Madden.jpg/150px-Madden.jpg
donutpop365: first time ive heard of c-movie tbh
HA! he did it!
gonna idle for a bit
Landed?
Wrek: have you decided to do or not to do ultramarine dash yet? Im not pressing Im just curious.
Barbetos|AtWork, he's called Madden?
Oh :P Okay than.
Barbetos|AtWork: no, said it
JOHN MADDEN
CrimsonPhoenix: apparently
C movies is something So increadibly Horrible that it is banished to one million year s dungion, like Epic Movie
Snakes? Snakes!
Wrek: WHo doesn't
Now I am hungry

PINKIE SENCE WORKED AGAIN

donutpop365: yup

donutpop365: just timezones
I am king of bad puns today.
so he prolly just got busy with real life
donutpop365: same movies shown twice
Except that was a good pun and therefore I am not king of bad puns.
donutpop365: firday for usa, saturday for europe
punny king then
does that count as baserape?
I usually watch the first movie on Friday Night, even though I'm EU^^
i need a credit card...

Also, where is this main stream you speak of? (Not mainstream but the non-Friday stream).
how rude
it's no non-image links flutterbrony123
They don't sell prepaids out there?
flutterbrony123: are you completly fucking retarded?
flutterbrony123: that is an image.
nope
Well that kind of sucks hard.
Although constantly posting images can strike some ire from the mods as well.
....did that tank just drive up the stairs?
Hello my Minnesotan friend even though I don't know you (yet).
i thought it was a vid
if they did my steam library would be a lot bigger
That pretty much happens to all of us :/
I'm pretty sure mchsi is Iowa too.
flutterbrony123: it says jpg at the end
it'S also a 4chan link
sorry :P
Maybe you can get others from the forums to join us :P
lol
Wrek: What is it you have against Spongebob?
I haven't been on the forum in forever
oh

Oh alright
Oh, any stream then. Okay!

We are just trying to keep this place alive :)
But right now all the chatrooms are the same right?
We do have regulars coming here now.
hard when you don't have a wide audience
becasue it gets qite full here during movie night
DEM SUNGLASSES :D
right now yes
donutpop365: yeah
I think its because we haven't been targeting the skylanders audience
Is this room still open during movie night?
nic sunglasses dude streaming ya look like a coper xD
Yes
Is this super nintendo?
Haven't played any of it lol
^:S
Dovah: inherently is spelt with an e
I stopped after Dawn
donutpop365: yes
Tomatos nope, it's NES
you see the room youre in down there in the tabs. #bronystate is the mainroom
heard it's fun though
I'm assuming that until the skylanders fans find out we are here, it probably wont change much in this place
im back
Oh, hello donutpop365! New?
It's Gamecube. :P
ekips: looks like amiga to me
Dawn of the dragon? I played through it, loved the game
Yes I am :P
My pet peeves: 1) Not knowing things. 2) people who dont use common sence. 3) people who correct the littlest things.
it was alright for what it was
MadSurge: Yes, yes I am.
after that I got enticed by my buds to play TOR
Dovah: that's nice
guys, its clearly sega
Dovah sense*

Dark_Horst: sure it's not atari?
TOR?
I knew someone would correct Dovah :D
donutpop365: welcome to Bronystate then! :)
So, we watching Call of Duty?
DashWithRainbows: thanks! :)
The Old Republic, it's that STar wars MMO

No problem brah.
Tomatos: Planetside 2
Tomatos yes
Garettbrony: Wrek!

Dovah: It looked like thinly veiled sarcasm to me...
so thats what wrek looks like
Yep!
Tomatos It's a Halo and CoD crossover.
and now it's Guild Wars 2
cowvarkian: what did?
So then this is an Xbox game.
MadSurge: Thanks!
Dovah: oh. nothing
Tomatos: PC
Garettbrony ikr, I've imagined him completely different from what he actually looks like :D
Nah, It's Planetside 2.
so did I
DashWithRainbows: actually, it's halo/battlefield
cod is somethign compeltely different
donutpop365: did you read the rules?
I don't know...I don't think PC has this kind of graphics.
read the rules
Tomatos It does.
he looks like a top gun fighter pilot Wrek
You
Hi bronystate :)
Naruto: "Believe It!"
Tomatos: You would be surprised
Computers can have way higher specs than consoles.
Apparently most of my friends get "watcha doin?" and "How is you?" confused
hi cachi01|phone
the next time Wrek dies, I have to go to bed >.>
MadSurge: I am right now.
Hello cachi01|phone
Last game I played on PC was Doom.
Dark_Horst: no, I'm saying it looks like the gameplay is that, not the actual game
Hi AjIsAwesome and Obsidian :)
You're right Wrek, it's for the Wii.
Dark_Horst: overall
The Wii couldn't render that gun by itselg.
itself*
:d
The Wii is pretty cool.
Wrek you look like a top gun fighter pilot
Meanwhile: when did you get here?
I AM ALWAYS HERE.
He lurks.
Meanwhile: mmk

Friendly fire is on in this?

Its been Mass Effect for me lately
Tomatos: That's wrek.
Well, guess that's one incentive to improve your aim.
Dark_Horst: # 43 then?
that window doesnt want to get trespassed
I havent actually played the third game yet, havent had the time
Everlasting_Joy: I don't think he looks like a wreck, he looks awesome.

wrek sure is getting murdered alot
We just..really need the population
thats all part of the plan]
cowvarkian: I don't think he's trying.
Garettbrony: the plan to die?
Everlasting_Joy: I never said he was
all part of the plan
We have had a few new names show up this week but they seem to leave right away if they just see a few names
cowvarkian: I think you mean marklar sure is getting marklared a lot.
Iirc Wrek plays a sort of infiltrator stealth support type, he's not really built for all the close up engagement he's doing.
cowvarkian: touche.
cowvarkian are you the doctor of death?\
Everlasting_Joy: indubiadly
Garettbrony: sure
ALL PART OF THE PLAN. http://denver.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw1235_Discord_go_on.gif

NEVER mind sorry.

What's with those icons in the bottom-right corner of the screen?

Mozdoc: planetside 1
*2
Yep, A Linux, Apache, MySWL, Python or PHP server is the first enemy of earthbound :P
Tomatos: that icon is a warning label for Discrimination. :P

So donutpop365, do you have a favorite pony?

MadSurge: Sayin' okeydokeylokey doesn't count as roleplaying does it? I've kinda made a habit out of using that.
Brony is a unisex term anyway.
Did you end up collecting it?

05flutterdash: your sex doesnt matter here, we treat everyoen equally
^^
yay
it's her choice on what to be called

Also hi, I'm back.
MadSurge: I don't have a favorite, but I do have favorites :D

Wrek: god?

WREK WHO IS BEST PONY
Meanwhile: :D.
We always try to get his attention when hes here but so far nothings worked
Meanwhile: SO HANDSOME!
Meanwhile: pfft
lol
XD
Wrek's favourite pony is Twilight.
Wow
I think he has a buddy
I'm guessing wrek is terran, right
@wrek who is best pony?
Big Awesomeface McLargeHuge of house Squid
who is that in the corner? :D
trust me he knows how to talk :P
flutterloves: He'd say Twilight/.
Derpy_Hooves: Wrek.
donutpop365: I like Pinkie and Fluttershy, but everyone here has their favorites :D
oh sorry
my bad
cowvarkian: nope. New Conglomerate.
I know one of these days hes suddenly going to start talking all sorts of stuff
Barbetos|AtWork: ah, ok

Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Sun and Moon: A Pony Strategy Game
wrek: HOW MUCH for those shades?!
Screw you too Planetside.
They have such a lame back story
out of the three types of ponies who would you be?
That's a slap to the face when you die. Game tells you "STOP KILLING YOURSELF!".
hi
Oh I wouldn't worry about it
It basically goes like this "We are fighting for our liberty!"
hi everypony :)
Howdy flutterdash!
I'm not
flutterloves: What about alicorns?
Anyone who makes an alicorn OC needs a kick in the teeth.
donutpop365: dont even go there
^^
Meanwhile: That.
^
so who made you admin here then?
i love alicorns /)
Alicorns are essentially "gods", is that the assumption, since we've only seen four so far?
^
Noone really...
That's true.
four?
Three.
nobody? lol it just fell out of the sky
its a bit of a long story
ill start from the beginning :)
ah
yeah, i'd say i counted 3 too
huh, aparently theres going to be a live performance of 'gangnam style' in melbourne
Luna, Cadence, Celestia, and do ya count uh the evil one.
Wait, Chrysalis.
donutpop365: alicorn OCs are frowned upon here :D
Forgot her name.
There's an alicorn in Twilight's "magic kindergarden" scene in S2E3.
05nightmare moon
Nvm, FOur.
Earlier this year, this place was still owned by Spryrocks
There ya go, Chrysalis.
donutpop365, chrysalis?
05OH adn my OC
Same pony, Wrek :P
Nightmare is just Luna though, realistically.
Wait really?
/me kicks Wrek in the teeth.
nightmare moon was just luna biting the nut
donutpop365, also technicaly a changling :P
But when he disappeared the channel will stay owned as long as he shows up here within 60 days
Wrek: I think we'd all like to see you try and pilot a plane : )
same pony.... kinda
Wrek does your OC get all da mane 6?
Yea.
Wrek: Liar, yours is an earth pony
I don't think Changelings count as far as Alicorns are concerned
I always saw Nightmare Moon as an eldritch abomination who just took over Luna's body, tbh.
Since they aren't really the same species.
everyone whats your favorite episode?
Phase4: how is it technically when she's the queen of changelings :P
Well he didnt show up for ages and the channel became unregistered
True.
Spectrum_Rush, i assume we were talking about alicorns
DashWithRainbows: He would only want Twilight
I have no favourite, I hate them all <_< >_>
Comment was directed towards Meanwhile.
FillyFlam: nah, it's Luna being evil.
Spectrum_Rush, chrysalist != pony
also i cant spell her name twice
Python?
FillyFlam: i think it was just a severe case of multiple personality disorder. emotional stress can do that
Phase4: Python? :D
he also went inactive and the channel became unregistered again
is dashwithrainbows and wrek the only people answering my questions?
Hmmmm Dari you sneaky bastard
yes
Dark_Horst: Hmm. Alright then. I coulda sworn I read that somewhere, though.
lose*
I guess
donutpop365, o_O
Still, anyone who makes their OC an alicorn is being incredibly pretentious.
I'm not going to answer that.
donutpop365: also, NEVER ask for ponies, as you're likely to get all generations except the current one :D
I don't answer questions, I raise them.
or they just love alicorns
No.
there really wasnt anyone in charge
You don't get an excuse.
FillyFlam: i tink faust commented on her da on that. but i completely forgot what it was
By then I decided to register it
You don't get a "Oh don't worry about it"
that was two weeks ago.
You are a tool and shall be regarded as such.
^
IC
hi
Meanwhile: only Lauren Faust is allowed to have an alicorn OC
Hey Adjeca
And if it's an Alicorn that's black and red I'm going to skip pleasantries and just cave your head in with bricks.
do you have a facebook wrek?
Dark_Horst: Ah, yeah, right. I should look that up.
flutterloves: Don't have a favorite episode really, too many.
how goes you?
Too many awesome ones that is.
http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/232/img20120504154626.jpg/ this is what i work with, on a daily basis
I'm just trying to keep this place alive
lol
what game?
I'm doing ok
ok
Meanwhile: but black and red means cool and mysterious and slightly dangerous! isnt it totally cool?
Giant slinkies?
http://www.ebay.com/itm/271065857589
Dark_Horst: You're kidding ight?
lol
Derpy_Hooves: WOAH, macaroni!
:P
According to Gen's mom, liking something that you don't like makes that person creepy 8)
I'm surprised nobodys placed a bid on that yet
i dont like stalking
i need to make a black/red alicorn with a trollface for a cutie mark
Dark_Horst: Not as much as it means "Teen angst"
AJIsAwesome|Hungry: you cant see it, by my sarcasm is showing
what game?
Derpy_Hooves: :O PIPES
Dark_Horst: Oh, really? :P
yes MadSurge
YA, really!
red and black means lack of imagination and no sense in colour combinations
^
black red looks good on cloth.
dat gunshot
I guess.
:? WHAT GAME!
black goes with almost anything
Crystaline_Shard: Planetside 2
planetside 2 sheesh
Thank you Obsidian
np
put black and red on your car. put black and red on your jacket if you want. put black and red on a pony, you deserve to get your shit slapped back in order
Allicorn has really got it out for Wrek.
put it on an alicorn adn listen to the crowd cock the shotguns
ok im convinced. as soon as i get the time im making a black red alicorn with fangs and a trollface cutie mark
lol
isn't this game still in the alpha phase?
weeping_pegasi82: He got a code for the Beta
Apparently beta.
weeping_pegasi82:beta
twilight_sprinkle: Don't forget the massive amounts of scars. That
i wonder if they have dragon wing sof rponies
11,01Fighting Pinkie Pie: http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg607/scaled.php?server=607&filename=pvppinkiepie.png&res=landing
I'd take a shotgun to be honest.
oops my mistake
how do you make a pony with the same animation from the show?
twilight_sprinkle: AND BATWINGS
You learn to draw.
Nittany_Discord dem bookmarks.
AJIsAwesome: i'll be using the OC maker for bonus rage, idk if they have scars
i meant online
Battle on got into the pony action....
twilight_sprinkle: DO IT. :D
You learn to draw with a tablet.
Nittany_Discord: ponies and ponies and ponies and ponies
let's play it!
:| f you
11,01The game calls her Princess Pink Pie and not Pinkie Pie though.
flutterloves: There are ponymakers online. I highly recommend that you make one yourself thoguh.
*though
twilight_sprinkle: for binus rage, edit the scars on with paint
Nittany_Discord: Hooray XKCD.
where do you find one?
flutterloves: google
flutterloves: Just search for one.
twilight_sprinkle: for maximum rage, just recolor celestia. with paint
You learn to google.
ok
Dark_Horst: lol thats a good idea
Nittany_Discord: You're a gamer, or so it would seem from your bookmarks.
twilight_sprinkle: Also don't forget an incredibly stupid fanfic to go with your OC.
twilight_sprinkle: If you want to make it truly ragetastic try and make it look like you mean it.
AJIsAwesome: eh, gotta keep the balance of no effort/rage inducing, fanfic sounds like a lot of work
11,01donutpop365: I am.
twilight_sprinkle: Okay. :D
past sins. there, i said it
That overrated fanfic?
...you could simply rip off past sins
that would hit hard
08,01the Portal 2 OST is EPIC on fancy shmancy reference monitor earphones
donutpop365: he also hates EA for their terrible profit politics over videogames
ive never read past sins
Past Sins, was alright.
I hear it's highly overrated.
there is always another one Wrek.
same here twilight_sprinkle
11,01Don't hate EA anymore. Got too cynical with them.
What do the icons in the lower right of the stream mean?
I made my mac and cheese wrong ;___;
08,01Kandarihu: but... the cake is a lie
past sins. the fic that got way more flak than it deserved. also way more love than it deserved
Hey Wrek, what kinda system do ya have?
Mozdoc: from left to right, discrimination, rated for ages 3 and above, strong language, and violence.
08,01MadSurge: i prefer the Bach
Dark_Horst: *Looks at My Little Dashie*
the fanfic that caused a way too large shitstorm that it should have
Meanwhile: seems legit
what AJIsAwesome said
Mozdoc: But they're just there for giggles, they don't actually correspond with content.
Wrek self rates his stream?
also *than it should have
11,01Did that with Activision as well. Not my proudest moment.
Mozdoc: yes :D
Wrek is still doing planet side?
Cupcakes can go die in a fire. It's one of the HIGHEST overrated and stupid fanfics out there. There are much better gore fics out there besides Cupcakes.
Is it true that EA tried to buyout valve?
Yes
back
Mozdoc, I was doing some research on that. It's symbols from the PEGI rating system.
When did that happen?
front
A while ago, I think.
XD
Is it me or do matches in this game drag on for veeeery long?
probably some time this year
MadSurge: they never stop
MadSurge: Big game
i beleive it was a month ago
Didnt EA try to copy steam and it was utter crap?
Is that musin ingame, or is he just overlaying some music?
that was origin
music*
11,01Yeah. Origin. I can't judge it based on the fact that I never used it.
11,01EA would have been fine if they didn't try to be control freaks with Origin.
night guys
Night.
I tried it. Its crap.
night alexxm
night alexxm :)
Define controlfreaks
bye alexxm
Goodnight alexxm
oh yah i'm back
Hai everypony
11,01Night alexxm.
From left to right, they stand for "Contains discriminatory content or promotes discrimination" "Suitable for users 3 and up" "Contains foul language" "Contains violence"
hi DerpyMuffins
donutpop365: Wrek likes to bring in his own music
hi DerpyMuffins
Who is streaming?
wrek
Wrek is
Wrek.
DerpyMuffins: Wrek
yeah. the terms of agreement in EA origin basically said nothing else than "hey buddy, the anus of your ahrddrive now belongs to us. yours too"
DerpyMuffins: and as you can see, there he is! :D
Dark_Horst: Wait what
11,01Steam scans your HD as well. Also, EA changed that part of the EULA.
Man you look good for someone who smokes Wrek
11,01I just disagree with EA's banning policies.
Hory shoot iz dat sum Sumica onscreen?
SpadeMagnes[School]: yes. looked like themeanest kind of spysoftware. they basically gave themselves the right to do whatever the fuck they want
How bad are they Nittany?
Kurra: nope, Wrek
Kurra: No that's Wrek.
Kurra: Wrek
Nittany_Discord wait what does Steam scan on your HD??? D:
11,01I think it does.
SpadeMagnes[School]: it got changed in later versions, but of course nobody trusted them after the first version
Wrek is stylin' btw |v
Inb4 spy sappin' his sentry.
SpadeMagnes[School]: i still dont
Kurra: agreed, those sunglasses are smashing!
What determines how much lag is generated when you play online games? Your connection speed?
and brb again :p
11,01SpadeMagnes[School]: It was to the point where bans from EA-run forums meant that you lost your Origin account. It was really due to EA tying accounts in. It was a bad move since forum bans carried draconian punishments now.
This is your captain speaking lol.
Draconian?
hi all :D
If I heard that inflight...
hi FlutterMEDIC
Hello FlutterMEDIC
SpadeMagnes[School]: look it up
11,01I think even now, forum bans means bans from MP.
SpadeMagnes[School]: think he meant draconic. as is evil
Is it okay to post an off topic image?
11,01Game bans should be handed out by at least the game dev, not the publisher.
Ok... only forum I ever browse is the WoW forum
11,01donutpop365: As long as it's within the rules.
Okay.
11,01Should say at most the game dev.
Any of you XKCD fans?
Besides editing game settings is there a way to increase how much fps you get for online games?
donutpop365: just post the pic
Dark_Horst: he means draconian, or of great severity
Wrek opened his map, and I started trying to zoom it out. =|
donutpop365: whatsitnow?
Dont crash
donutpop365: not me, but we post that too :D
http://xkcd.com/1112/ Any of you seen him before? Hatguy.
cowvarkian: well, my foreign language skill improved today
my WoW tends to lag when there is ALOT of shit on my screen
Dark_Horst: and draconic means relating to dragons
donutpop365: basically, it boils down to no porn and no gore.
cowvarkian: yep. i had them dwapped around
<+swapped

I never under stand why Hollywood started the whole getting shot knocks you back
Obsidian: What is wrek playing
How did that guy not see that
Oblivious.
cow334: Planetside 2
SpadeMagnes[School]: because it looks cool
donutpop365: also, youtube links are fine, but they're not allowed during a stream.
:)
Barbetos|AtWork: Tunnel-vision?
Obsidian: oh
hi Shadi
Hello!~
it also DOES knock you back
It defies the law of equal and opposite reaction
hi Shadi
hu Shadi
sonuvabitch
Wassap?
SpadeMagnes[School]: >.> what are they getting shot with?
Thats some crazy tunnel vision. Its kind of hard to miss a bright blue sheild found on that mounted turret.
which movie?
what's your prime example?
Highly intelligent shade of blue he is not.
cow334, you see that chilled-out guy in the upper-righthand corner who looks like Wrek's Desktop Pony? That's Wrek
i lik thta rifle
Okay then.
Barbetos|AtWork: from my experiences in TF2, i've seen pyros be oblivious to HEAVIES
Geh I don't remember, I just saw Mythbusters test it
we shall call it flarple rifle
it sound spretty
Kandarihu: Really??
SpadeMagnes[School]: myth busters don't always do the science right
cow334, yeah
Wait,is this live-streaming?
Kandarihu: I didnt no that lol he looks pretty chilled
ANd that guy, he seriously thought he could win?
Shadi: Yes
Shadi: live stream
Cool!~
ill be right back
I guess I understand. I have been in that auto pilot mode before.
btw, any of you guys live in Minnesota?
Brain off with w + m1 all the way
And I see he's gone New Conglomerate since the last wipe.
FlutterMEDIC: Yus.
Crap.G2G. b back tomorrow,mebbe. :P
FlutterMEDIC: Why?
and i still think the flight physics in there dont look very flighty
We should stream Kaizo Mario :P
looks like the aircraft is moving on rails
donutpop365: need to find more bronies in the state
Dark_Horst: I still think the flight physics look bvery in beta
SpadeMagnes[School]: YESH
*very
SpadeMagnes[School]: DO IT FILLY
Barbetos|AtWork: then I guess I'm a slightly better noob pyro, I like to sneak with my Pyro :D
FlutterMEDIC: Do you?
Live that is.
MadSurge: your doing it right,
donutpop365: i wouldn't of asked if i didnt live in Minnesota
What is W + M4 or what ever it is?
.__.
Bronysith: DAT REFERENCE
Ganon's mom doesn't care that he's bi and according to Gen's mom, that's wrong
SpadeMagnes[School]: W + M1 = Forward and FLAME with pyro
Crystaline_Shard: I get killed all the time, but hey, people are surprised to see me sometimes :D
And she won't tell me why that's wrong
Woah, in beta and they're already selling ingame upgrades? What?
Bronysith: Fluttershy would never use a sword. She'd kill it with her terminal cuteness.
Need to leave for thte moment. bbl everypony.
Everlasting_Joy: or stare it to death :D
Everlasting_Joy: the sword is the only thing that CAN kill a colossus man
Later Obsidian.
Ciao.
Everlasting_Joy: I've even seen the Soldier from TF2 get Diabeetus from her.
Bronysith: Now that I think of it, why would she kill it?
sorry
flutterloves: nice
Got it, thanks.
so i gotta ask, who here speaks spanish?
Dovah: you, presumably
cowvarkian: nope
ah, ok
flutterloves: that is a bad creator

My parents decided to be dumbasses and go with a morgage group or something that turns out to have a very bad credit rating...they didn't bother to fucking thorughly check it
KoL A game about D and D and being constantly on a quest to be drunk.
<3
11,02O.O
So they withdrew all the money and we were supposed ot get paperwork, we didnt the paper work
SpadeMagnes[School]: hmm
DAT NewSuperBronyU :O
Dat NewSuperBronyU! MOOO
11,02Moooooo ^-^

Wrek
Buytoast: Wreky is!
My parents are so god damn stupid sometimes...

they could've been abusive alcoholics
Buytoast: true dat
We probably cant even get the money back, so we just fucking conned
Feels like a hot wing night.
awwww yeaaaah

SpadeMagnes[School]: yeah, probably you did get conned
Okay, so, my band's bigges fan from Pirot, Serbia, sent me this message on skype: yo Ian,because you are so cool,you'il get shoutout in my new show so go see my new video. I feel like a role model
link?
String_Shredder: what band?
nvm
Well thats whathappens when my parents dont fucking thorugly check a morgage group before signing up with them
so i guess nobody can help me out with spanish homework? well how bout biology?
try not to let it bother you
cowvarkian: You've probably never heard of us
Dovah: i know a few things about biology
String_Shredder: that's why im asking

donutpop365 RainBro simply goes by a male version of RD.
donutpop365: there's a few mods that I haven't met myself, though RainBroDash's OC kinda looks like a male RD
We try to keep this place alive

donutpop365: I mean seen them in chat :D

I dont even know where my wii is
/me 11,01turns on stream and sees Wrek doing a PnP. Nice.
or any of my game systems
Oh ok.

11,01Picture-in-picture.
\something like that...
=============================================================whata
Wrek, is the OC that Bacon is resting his head on belong to Slurry by any chance?
he would just randomly argue with people.
true my english was horrible, it still is actually, but back then I was a dutch 14 years old kid
argue?.. mash them more like it
dont they teach english in NL
Hope it wasnt taken personally
not a big deal
i wish i had a paint program :/
no thats not bacon
well I am pretty strange too so...
I'm pretty sure the program Panda told me he uses (Sai) is free, isn't it?
robotdragon9 They are not hard to find.
if you do its a bonus.
donutpop365 its free for 30 days...
I don't believe anyone is normal these days..
robotdragon9^

Bet we'll have at least 1.5X or 1.7X that amount for Season 3 premiere.
Scoot-Scootaloo: I'm going on memory, which is terrible, so you're probably correct.
Hey wrek your uniform thats hanging there it looks like a spy uniform there dude

Dat Wrek partying soft
....right?
Nitty is your OC in a maid outfit?
11,01No.

There was a show for it in the 90s
Hows everyone :3
This is perfect reading music!
Hi, Thrackerzod :)
11,01I'd like less art of my OC in a maid outfit really.
00,03I'd like more art of Fluttershy with Mew Hair!
13i spy mit mein little eye somepony that looks like me <3
Nittany_Discord: I wonder why 6_9.
i have to many pictures of my OC R63 >_<
the one in that pink mane there
._. i'm 12
11,01While there isn't much art of my OC, there's more of him in a maid outfit than not.
11,01My fault really.
Maybe I should contribute to that Nittany_Discord.
How about a janitor uniform?
:P
11,01I think the proportion is 60/40 give or take. I'll have to count.
If I was good at art I would draw Nittany's OC
Come to think of it, I haven't seen any non-maid art made for Nittany_Discord's OC.
You know whats fun getting minecraft to work on 10 computers that only have about a gig of ram for a LAN party
What?
And getter the server for it to work
Jeez my DA has art I made like a year or more ago, kinda bad.

OOH!

Shizuka >.> shizu pony... coming soon?
I dunno
XD
DRUMS
I do some art, but I'm more of a computer addict .-.
What kind of music would this even be classified as?

hey guys I'm looking for a good computer drawing program with tablet and stylus which one should I get?
SAI
it's what everyone use
never heard of it
well the only drawing pad i have use right now is bamboo so i cant really give you a pick weeping_pegasi82
Paint Tool Sai
weeping_pegasi82, how long have you been drawing?
To make a stallion ya just make their snouts taller right?
well I've loved drawing my whole life but I've only had 1 official class but I excell at cartoon characters
CrimsonPhoenix: what was that program called i use just paint because i dont no any art programs
Hey wheres AdamTheDuck?
13they start switching things up in the final area, plus some stupidly painful mobs that i had to summon minion after minion to not die
13and just when you think you're done, turns out there's still like three bosses to go
weeping_pegasi82, you might need some time to get used to the tablet at first but I heard bamboo is good enough and cheap
This music isn't even with English lyrics is it? What nationality is it even?
Also Paint Tool Sai, google it

Freefall29: Well the Gamecube controller works with the VC
What What What?
Is there ponified version of that???
Of what?
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4881/
Fat Albert.
Everlasting_Joy: oooh...okay okay i do say good guess
FOUND ONE!
wut
I guess because it was made for n64, it just feels more better to play on n64.
Dumb lag
after playing skyward sword. I love navi so much more then I used to
Dovah: For some reason, I read that in Sweetie Belle's voice.
Everlasting_Joy: Good
Freefall29: I don't care what anyone says, the Water Temples in all Zelda games are awful!
hello
Hey Wahahaha
08,01Everlasting_Joy: for some reason, I read *that* in Applebloom's voice
Love everything about Skyward Sword except main villain boss fights and Fi.
how's it going
i swear Wrek looks like the guy from video game highschool i think his name was
THE LAW
That poster is a spy!
Everlasting_Joy: I've played zelda 1, no water temple... link to the past, the water temple was a lot of fun. you must be refering to oot's water temple.
00,03His chin looks like... mine o_o
Sleepy?
Dat Wrek with no sunglasses
You need sleep, Wrek. :D
Looks quite nice!
Yes, you do, you oughta sleep.
woah, whats all this?
You look like you need some sleep Wrek
05its not sleep i need
Ummmm. Dat bone cracking O_O
Everlasting_Joy: you talking about just the temples... not the game as a whole. correct
he needs his motor oil
Wrek: you need some of them coffe
or eat some pickes
pickles
Freefall29: Yes, the water temples in those games are terrible.
He needs an E-Tank.
Arabica or Robusta?
Freefall29: The games themselves are some of my most cherished video game memories.
They say Arabica is better, but to be honest Robusta just sounds so much better.
Everlasting_Joy: its been a while since I played TP, I don't remember the water temple there having any problems for me
Everlasting_Joy: The Water Temple's easier on the 3DS since the Iron Boots are a C-Button item, plus they added more direction stuff to make it easier to see where to go
Wrek you looks like a sane Tom Cruise
look*
So, is this just outliing everything, or his he going for a cartooish look?
took so long :|
J_E_Smith71: Fair enough. The only good that ever came out of any water temple was in OoT, Dark Link.
well what ahppend to their glasses?
Prince_Lightboom: thats quite good though
Not sure if that's yours.
^
Freefall29: I suppose you're like me, only played TP once or twice.
Prince_Lightboom: why are Rainbow's eyes red?
i copied vinyls eyes and putted them there
They are indigo
srry i got a bit lazy
i think
Everlasting_Joy: man. I want midna to return, she's one of the reasons I love the game
Someone else did the same thing you did about a month ago and they just copied someone else's drawing and called it their own.
I need to go guys, see yous
that's still pretty nice Prince_Lightboom
Who is streaming Wrek?
Yes.
Rustymeat: Yesh
Freefall29: Agreed.
Rustymeat: Yep
Kewl
Again, still not sure if that's your drawing.

Austin: Aye. Xbox. :P
Klumzeedragon: xbox?

Everlasting_Joy: I am a bit over weight but I did lost some of it during summer. I look much better but my face makes me look like a junkie
Scoot-Scootaloo: Oh? That was your OC? I saw that the other day on his blog. :D
11,01Better keep it down Ponies47.
08,01my OC's CM is really a cornucopia

...What is this about- oh it's a Wrek stream.
Though PSY said the dance was basically riding on a horse, so that's kinda redundant?

Yep.

Nittany_Discord: seems pretty nice
CCCP: you couldnt post links if you were on the phone
It's a good time waster.

Nittany_Discord: eh okay then
CCCP: what
What is it - moreover what is wrong with my mind
Nittany_Discord, you get what you pay for >:)
technically, I'm a pegasister, but I like brony better anyway
you found out that im actually on my PC Bronysith
You can buy Sparkle Gems for stuff, but you don't need them.
Brony is unisex anyway.
Nittany_Discord: so any upgrade in the game
05hwo you like the song? :D
but my stream is down for reasons Bronysith
LOVE IT
I'm a opne brony but I'm only a high school freshman and only abot 3 weeks in. I would have to be a comeplete idiot to wear a brony shirt to school
CCCP: anyone with at least .00001% of a brain could figure out you were on the pc
I like this channel.
*open
Yeah. You can earn SG in battle if you have an SG battle, or you can buy them.
Wrek: It's awesome :>
Bronysith no they couldnt they'd probably be ded
Ponies47: my first day of school i weared a dj pone shirt
actually met some bronys
CCCP: no, snooki is still alive
Nittany_Discord: sounds pretty cool
Really, it's a puzzle game. You battle by completing matches in a board.
lol
ACTUALLY There's a very good chance CCCP is on a phone look: meuycxuykn@tdzo-11-383-07-396.bos.east.verizon.net
Spoonfulthought: :).
Spoonfulthought: I has dat shirt. I might wear it to school at some point :P
That's CCCP
Hm?
wT
WHy would you point that out for CCCP?
Ponies47 nobody in my new school except for 1 friend (he lived in san antonio for 4 years) knows what a brony is. So i can use my shirt anytime =D

Who watched My Little Pony this morning?
Met some bronies at my university. We're trying to get a Brony Club started there.

donutpop365: wouldnt you have to compare it with his usual one
zombidash. that is a scary thought
Yeah, I think someone's impersonating CrimsonPhoenix.
yuppies
twilight_sprinkle: I don't know his usual one, I just checked what his username is.
Wrek I am very sorry to bother you but please ban me
wy dose he want to get ban
red spy is in base
twilight_sprinkle: I don't know if that's the usual one though, so I wouldn't know, I just made the assumption.
Dat CrimsonPhoenix is a Spai
SPAI
fun fact: it takes the same amout of force to bit a carrot, as it does to bite off the tip of your pinkie finger.

Well, there you have it.
05you stay here and man up

He's not banning you.
fun fact--- it takes fewer muscles to punch people in the face than to smile; so you should always punch people in the face
CrimsonPhoenix dude you are not an attention whore :/ u r awesome
I deserve a ban
:S
CrimsonPhoenix: But why?
yes you do, crimson

While I'm at it - heard a good one about a janitor and some Jr High aged girls :) - This group of girls would put on make up in the morning, lipsitck included - they'd kiss the mirror leaving a lip imprint - this went on for about 2 weeks until the Janitor complained about how hard it was to clean their makeup off the mirror...
Cypresswolf|URU: eeww
them girls are nasty then
Cypresswolf|URU: why would they do that?
kissing the restroom mirros
like seriously
thats actually kind of hawt
I am sorry, I cant seem to get over the fact that Wrek is going to Fly into the Danger Zone with those 80's aviator glasses :p
hey hey hey

Oh Wreky he looks fucking AWESOME
CCCP: although i respect your opinion, how si that hawt?
CCCP: lets say there was ....lets just say whats if there was stuff on the mirros
etc
LadyCanary, I didnt say he looked bad
just... 80's :p
Cypresswolf|URU: Wow. . . And here I thought middle schoolers couldn't sink any lower.
The next morning the priciple gathered the girls up so the janitor could give a demonstration of how hard that make up was to clean - he turns around, picks up a squee-gee, dips in the toilet, and wipes the mirror :D
Ryunosuke: I was talking about the pony, silly XD
oh :p
I didnt say you said he looked bad XDD
Dashie20Percent: it wont let me watch it it says this video is unavalible
Cypresswolf|URU: :D

Reikim: dwarf fortress?
Never heard of it.

Hold on, I'll get a description.

Also, SUDDENLY Reikim :O
We are the new friendly. We are the bitter bucolic. If i have to share friendchips you can have them. We are the pulse of the bronies......yeah i had to do it
Dwarf Fortress has you managing seven psychotic, manic-depressive, retarded alcoholic midgets dropped in the middle of nowhere. If you're good, you get more. And then you try to keep them from killing themselves, being killed, or otherwise spiraling into insanity.
That's Dwarf Fortress.
........sounds......interesting
<3 Dat candybar bumtaze
Anybody in Regs interested in Dwarf Fortress?
sounds cool! where is it?
Sounds like taking care a psychiatric ward in a hospital
(delt with too many screamers in life)

Would you be willing to play a game about dwarves?
http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/405/490/62b.gif u know it goes great

ChangelingSlayer: i should write a fanfic about that
I ask about Dwarf Fortress because I have decided that it would be awesome to create a narrative-styled Bronystate Dwarf Fortress Community Fort. I'm currently taking volunteers. Join the madness so you can say you were on the bus before it got cool!
Maybe...
Nope :(
i c dis guy is a tf2 fan
Reikim: is it free?
Austin: Indeed.
NO
Reikim: im in!
NO PARTY ROCK
Austin: THAT WHOULD BE SWEEEEEEEET
Reikim, do you have any idea about what Dwarf Fortress is?
ChangelingSlayer: i should do that! now!
On the live broadcast. :I
cachi01|phone: Just go watch a parody of it or something.

A strange little game.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT, really involved rts
rock it wrek!
WREK.
Wrek.gif
OH LORD.
Badass.
Meanwhile: :D
Phase, you want in? We're doing a community fort.
Meanwhile make it happen
Except, you are wearing sunglasses, indoors.
YES.
Implying I know how to do that.
I used t be an artist like him. then i took an arrow to the knee
"We" being me, RX, and anyone else I can recruit.
....
otakon's already signed up.
Canary cry? Canary cry time.
WOW.
SO MUCH BADASSERY.
Reikim, i could never wrap my head around the game
You don't need knees to draw.
Bah
You should be laid, on a regular basis, Wrek.
It's not that hard once you learn the hotkeys.
I use to make pointless references to skyrim then I shot myself
Everybody died :(
if u only wear sunglasses outside u aint got swag
Who says that?
if only people would actually do that
thats the other issue, so many hotkeys
It has hotkeys?
SWAG needs to die.
Only about twenty, max.
Maybe more.
^
if someone says one more arrow to the knee joke, you got an ax to the head!
*makes list to be a badass artist*
XDDDDD
^^
XD
Wreky <3333
i'm not a wow player i can't handle over 10 hotkeys
Reikim, its multiplayer?
Go wrek! Go wrek! It's your birthday! It's your birthday!

Wrek Dem tf2 prints
At the one-year mark, you are required to save it, zip it, and send it to the next person in line.
Reikim, yeah, i'd probably screw it up, interesting concept though
The whole point is to screw it up.
That's the beauty of it!
so ten bucks say that Sir Dragonherkers Land of Depravity will take this and lable it as skyrim
Some of the chaos from such forts is legendary.
XD
Buytoast you mean EQD
along with the other drooling masses that swarm it
Anyway, we do that, and at the same time, we write a narrative around the madness.
i'll give it a shot i supose

Yay~

Fun Fact: All the characters in the ray-man series Speak in pig latin.
^
piglatin?
Instead of saying good job
They say
Isn't it only in this game?
odd bog
or ood bog
Can I post picture links?
Nope
ood gay ob jay?
They speak the same way throughout the entire series.
AJIsAwesome|Busy: Yup.
But anyways..
How are you?
What abot Rayman 3? Don't they speak normally?
Nope
Hm.
Pig latin :3
Okay.
Of course you read it out normally but listen to there speech and you can actually make out there words.
I remember playing Rayman 2: the great escape...loved that game
Hodlum havoc was my favorite.
I could never get into Rayman as a kid.
I wonder if they'll ever let it be downloadable for the Wii...
Then this game made me love it.
Sylandest: Its a sony production
Sylandest: Wait not the n64 -lol
Sylandest: I kinda doubt it.
Sylandest: It was originally supposed to be downloadable, but then they changed it to purchase nly.
um hope I didnt gross you out
Oh, wait. wrong game. :D
I'm tripping on the song here....
11,02:D
11,02D:*
6_9
lol-ed
lol no you didn't
ouch :/
Mega_Milk, AJIsAwesome|Busy: so with that said, Rayman 2: potential download for the wii?
Sylandest: Doubtfull.
Hm....... I'm not sure.
Probably not.
cuz I would love it if it was. I replayed it so much, I prolly broke the old cartridge :D
I do know that Rayman 1 is downloadble via PSN.
It will heal though
Sylandest: You could always just install the Wii64 emulator on your wii and download the rayman 2 rom and pkay it that way.
so anyways...looks like its just us two again for tonight
Are you still awake Adjeca?
Mega_Milk:...that went completely over my head. :$
Sylandest: You know what an emulator is right?
http://www.n-europe.com/news/latest-3ds-update-blocks-95-of-flash-cards
Mega_Milk: I'm familiar with it...but I fear if you tried to explain now, it'd be useless. im heading off to bed. :$
NIght, Sylandest :)
Get some rest!
bai Sylandest
11,02Night Sylandest :)

A troll milestone usually
on my perifirel vision there's a yellow orb flying around
dat aim assist
flutterchu: It could be eye fluid causeing that
I dont mind kids playing
o-oh okay
as long their muture..
i do. you wont believe the "colorful" language they spout
LightTrooper105: I dont either until you get online and they discover cursing...
11,02:<
mature kid playing cod? http://www.funnydictionary.com/img/entry_images/900/vr7KUExgR8r.jpg
then you report them t-to trollark
Mega_Milk i play online for many years I know couple of kids who are muture and fun to play with
11,02brb ><
LightTrooper105, lol most teenagers are Muture
i'll wait

Tiberium126 most indeed
im surprised i haven't seen any borderlands 2 on this stream yet :(
LightTrooper105: I played online for like a month. And just couldnt take it. There worse than on TF2
Mega_Milk i know how you feel
h-happy birthday google *starts shaking*
o.o
so which pony would stand best chance in a mw3 campaign? i'd say twilight cause she's got a shield to deflect bullets
hmm still need to beat bf3's campaign
at least i think it would
LightTrooper105, I would always mute people on CoD
i wouldnt. i could use the comedy whenever i play a match
thisguy, the best pony is MANE 6
Not unless if your in a part chat
did SB beat that other game?
Tiberium126 so far on PC i rarely do as some most of my match people just shut up and play
LightTrooper105, sold my xbox because of the people on it and PC gaming is cheaper
cheaper? have you noticed prices for computer parts? it's craaaazy x.x
thisguy so?
Good evening BronyState :)
wow you soold your xbox because people wow dude it doesn't matter if theres people holy hell dude get used to it
AdamTheDuck hello

don't mind
its better then doing nothing yes?
yup
Heh really dude.........you had to that?
i enjoyed it last time :)
11,02You guys don't think of it as 'Hey, some guy is opening up packs of cards on stream so I'm super jealous and upset at him for doing that, how dare he'?
Nope.
Anypony here fish for a hobby?
i use too
i always have mt own cards :3
^^^
NewSuperBronyU, enope :D
I used to. I LOVED it.
i dont really care about cards o3o
Have some relaxing music. :) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--A8i8-vy4M
What cards? Pony cards?
MadSurge: Yep.
now if only target stocked up on cards :|
11,02ikr ><
even if I do have pony card i'll use it as a weapon :3
guess ill have to go to hot topic since they have them
11,02I'm getting a 30-pack box in the mail sometime, I hope to stream the opening of which o3o
Hot topic has pony cards?
11,02Yeah
11,02Though they charge $3.50 each for it
^ :O
11,02The cheapest is at Target, which is $1.99 a pack
$3.50?! :O
11,02Second cheapest is Toys R Us where it's $2.50 a pack
We dont have hot topic in Australia :'(
i can only buy pont=y stuff online T-T
my friend said last time they were selling them for 50 cents :|
Tiberium126 well they can deliver too you
but the shipping fee..
^
hoping wal-mart will carry dem cards soon
or get a winning code on one of the cards
I'm happy there isnt a wal-mart here
me too
wal-mart would kill all the little shops
my walmart just upgraded to a super center
holy frijoles, 3.50 for mlp card pack? thats kinda absurd
So who's queued up next?

SB!

I prefer German cause ther tanks...
LightTrooper105, yup
LightTrooper105: Oh yeh, they had great tanks, right?
eeyup
Oh wait... he went to sleep :(
when i was allies I saw a King Tiger I just panic and tell all my friend this "TAKE IT OUT FIRST!!"
What game is this Caramel?
MadSurge, the tiger tank a had no other tank to really worry about in WW2 but the pershing but they would still own them
Panda Company of Heroes
Thank you LightTrooper105 :)
the German know how to make tanks
Do you have airstrikes or anti-tank bombs in this game?
yes
its for support only
LightTrooper105, the 3rd reich were very smart
indeed
first to use Jet plane and assault rifle
Not enough smart to lay off Russia though
well make an opertaional Jet
the helicopter and sleath bomber
just blame the mad guy with the mustache
Yep
if they just leave their general at their best the war could be different
LightTrooper105, me no understand
if the mad guy with the mustache leave his general alone
well history might change
LightTrooper105, without hitler most of the world wouldnt be like it is now
true
I wouldnt be here
im just saying lol o3o
The nazis were far too willing to please Hitler to win :D
well they have to follow him
like it ot not
or*
MadSurge, OH you dont understand how they saw him. he was a god to them
LightTrooper105: yes, but they followed his wishes even when they were suicides
indeed
Only the soldiers. Officers and generals had a slightly more human perception of him
yup
History is History
Also they could have easily wiped out the D-Day forces with their brand new tanks, but they required Adolf's authorization to do that and he was napping at the time :D
MadSurge, YER LOL
and the assualt rifle was reject by Hitler at first
i look back at the stream I thought he was losing lol
Nope, winning
yeah I know
both
oh

Hello Gold_Demona :$
Time for me to go grab some coffee, because I'm not completely awake yet.
ohai MadSurge
I'm watching bad anime being riffed on
Stabber fleet issue = Minmatar, Minmatar = Projectile turrets ( Autocannons and Artillery) this ... put Energy Turrets (a different race, which the Stabber Fleet has NO bonuses to) wasted said 70 billion isk on a fit that doesnt work :)
let me dig up a linky
What game is this?
http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Stabber_Fleet_Issue --- Minmatar Cruiser Skill Bonus: 5% bonus to Medium Projectile Turret firing speed and 10% bonus to Medium Projectile Turret tracking speed per level.
not only did this person put energy turrets on it, it put SMALL energy turrets, not even medium ones
Who stream now?
Caramel
oh.
oh, 70 million, 50 million is the cost of the ship itself :p
didn't notice the pone in the corner.

"i am goign to wear a box. and it's full pf posion lobsters"
Is that better or worse than stuffing a bag full of crabs in your mouth?
http://www.memecreator.org/static/images/memes/567389.jpg
omg, I remember those things. XD
earlier today a gift code for a ti dev bord circled the internet, $200 board for $4
Mine had tetris on it. :3
Gold_Demona, i want something as powerfull as the ti software but on a ds
Well, it wasn't really mine. It was my husband's. (back when he was just my boyfriend)
it has 10 hours rechargable battery life and wont lag so much
Programming stuff's all over my head, sadly. =/
Better playing games than making them, eh?
lol, I couldn't make a game if my life depended on it. XD
i have a phobia of needels. not lie geting poked wit hthem and what not. i am scared of them going in then breaking.
taoumi, odd phobia
The closest I come to it is maybe some SUPER simple code modification if I stare at a code long enough to figure out what does what.
yeah. don't step on them
So, what game is this?
I wouldn't anyway. That shite hurts. =/
ever stepped on a thumbtack?
taoumi: Well, needles are made of metal, so it takes quite a hit to break them inside someone's skin
um... actualy alot less then you think
needles are so hard that they are supper brittle
you can break one with less force then it takes to break a pencil wit hoen hand
That said, I don't really like needles either. Nothing to be scared about though
Night everypony im off to bed its 6 over here i'll see you guys in the morning ok..........peace
nighty
eeyup
hmm game looks interesting
bye moopy
Doctor needles are also hollow. So I imagine they'd be easier to break than a solid needle.
05mornin
Hiyo Wrek
actualy they are harder to break
morning wrek
because they are halllow
Mornin' Wrek
what game is Caramel playing?
taoumi: yeah, but to be a doctor you need a steady hand, so there's very little chance of that happening. It's just like a bee sting, and those are ridiculous :P
ever tryed to bend a pipe vs the same width of soild
much easyer to bend soild
Hey Wrek! :)
Ryunosuke: Company Of Heroes
ah
oh i'm not afrid of hyperdermic needles
05comment and fave if you havent <3
05also hi Caramel :D
just needel that are o nthe floor
2,14 I'll ban everyone who doesn't favorite his viking pony -_-
05hehe
05you liked it val?
Wrek: will you publish the mods picture too?
2,14 twas good
05MadSurge: you'll see that one soon enough MadSurge ;3
Yay! :$
05yay rts :D
/me faves the viking pony
Even ponies look manly with a beard
This song
So, what game is this?
oh mig gawd
DESTROY DEM NAZIES
LOL
i came last in the team
MadSurge: he was commanding german tanks^^
Oh, Company of Heroes. I swear, I didn't see the title bar earlier.
lol
for a sec there I thought we're going to loss
:D
Dark_Horst: Well then, the coloring of units is inconsistent :D
Allies should always be blue and nazis red
im thinking maybe i should get this game
05ooo its the troublemaker
05time to be on my watch >:3
Troublemaker? Did a troll enter the chat?
Troll? Where? *pulls out tray of cookies*
05troll =/= troublemaker
Oh, My bad. *throws cookies away*
I heard trolls
That's my cue to bring out the hugging arms :$
/me wonders if Wrek was talking about him?
05nope Kandarihu <3
Oh, thank you
05believe it or not you've grown on me
05sometiems you're jsut fun to mess with ^_^
05but yeah
05no hard feelin's
Thanks. No hard feelings from me either
Now we are a family again. :D
/me puts away his hugging arms :<
05my light sorry excuse for a beards is actualyl grabbable now :3
05personal achivement x3
Wrek Yay? mines still extremely soft and everything but you can take it by a few fingers and yank it
05probably beats mine :P
05downside to being semi-blond
05your chin hairs stay blond for quite a while
Wrek Maybe not sure tbh. Oh and i'm actually gold blond ish so yeah but i have enough to actually have it visible ish :D
Would it be wrong of me to giggle at your man problems? :P
05not really
hispanic jew. all the brown currly hair :/
05im sure we'd giggle ourself silyl at menstruation anyways
Yeah probably. XP
omg, dah craaaaaamps! D:
Egh, I only manage to get stubble on my face .__.
I'm not a hairy guy
i never saw the advantages of black hair until today
05though apparently shaving ones face is about as sensitive as a mix of shaving genitalia and armpits (in terms of skin sensitivity) so the argumetn "we dotn know how it is" doesnt really fit that
Having dark hair is a DISadvantage for me. Makes my leg hairs painfully visible after shaving. :<
05based of the seterotype now though
05not saying you said that
05etc etc
05disclaimers
That must be because I have a semi-afro on my head :D
half-fro ftw :D
well another problem is, irregularities inbeard growth are also very visible
05yay for being akward!
THERE'S A HOLE IN MINE!
05and yeah
Wrek Nah not awkward if you ask me it's good discussion material :P
05i have a sligth scar on the center of my jaw
if genetic history is any indicator, that will atch up when i'm 25
05so not as beardy there as on the sides of said scar
There's a spot on my husband's face that refuses to grow with the rest of his beard, so any time he goes without shaving for a while, it looks really weird.
05so i kidn have an inverted hitler stache but on the otehr side of the mouth :|
I'm curly, so long hair means big puff of hair :D think Pinkie-like hair
Off-topic, I'm really diggin' this music. =)
Gold_Demona: :D
nemnemnem
BYE EVERY PONY
this talk of pinkie hair makes me feal tempted to find a picture of my pinkie costume from dragoncon
when i go without shaving, i just end up looking like a terrorist
Jmoooo!
nighty
Gold_Demona~
Night taoumi!
How are yas Jmo?
oh i'm not going to sleep for liek another 20 min :3
/me is late, is late, for a very important date!
i need bacon intake
problem is.. i have no bacon on hand
taoumi: Pinkie is awesome :$
good morning everypony
Hey DoctoDoctorWho@

I'm good thanks, yourself Gold_Demona?
I'm doing alright.
After my hubby finishes work today, he'll be on vacation for a week. So yay!~
Tis good.
Yay for vacation.
I apologise for my unforgiable lateness
So, fair warning, you guys won't be seeing very much of me next week. lol XD
The horror D:
Gold_Demona: how so? :(
05we'll miss ya Gold_Demona :D
05have a good time ^_^
heÄs got a tanky little problem there
Oh, I see Gold_Demona :D
MadSurge: I'm usually in here when my hubby's at work. If he's on vacation then he's home all day. :P
We will, thanks Wrek. ^^
At least we'll try. XD
if we know what she means
Gold_Demona: so, week going around with your husband? :3
We're not planning on going anywhere. Most of the week we'll just be sitting around at home.

Maybe have a special dinner cuz his birthday's in that week.
Gold_Demona: so next week you'll be preoccupied, http://derpy.me/TwAEp
i just finished my 2nd video
Bahaha, wink wink, DoctoDoctorWho
Gold_Demona: and watch movies? :D
Yes, we'll have a nice time indeed. :D
Wh's streaming?
Who
caramel
*
MadSurge: Maybe. We'll probably just watch Star Trek. Or PLAY Star Trek (Online)
Or both
Wrek Oi you got the C&C games right?
moo- oh h/she's not here
05not isntalled
he broke the bridge
Wrek plays C&C?!?!
:O
05didnt botehr past tiberium
RA3
best red alerts ever
I love you man!
05btw DoctoDoctorWho: you missed me sketchign adeptus mechanicus as pony yesterday
dammit, is it on DA?
tiberium... there was a c&c shooter planned to come out under that name
and then they canned it
05its jsut a sketch
becasue they "couldnt meet the expectations"
Dark_Horst: there is an fps for it
why did this show up when i was looking for "pinkie pie dragoncon 2012"
DoctoDoctorWho: yes, renegade
Gold_Demona: be sure to watch at least one Disco-I mean, Q episode :D
Wrek Ah so you really didn't play after C&C 2?
05i played all RAs
MadSurge: We've already past most of them. XD
05played the 2 first C&Cs
05pirated the 3rd
MadSurge: I think we only have 1 Q episode left to watch
Wrek: generals?
05i got generals aswell
Wrek Ah makes sense.
05i dont have zero hour though
CHAOS CHAOS CHAOS CHAOS CHAOS!!!!! Discord will come soon :3
Gold_Demona: in which series? Deep Space 9 or whatever it's called?
Hello everyone.
Next Generation. DS9 only has 1 Q episode.
I have the first decade and tiberium twilight
I see C&C Generals talk.
i think we had deja-q already, didnt we?
And the Q episode in DS9 is pretty uneventful, actually. :P
Gold_Demona: just him going for a golden egg, right?
I only got twilight so I could say I had it, the game itself sucks balls actually
MadSurge: Mostly it's just him trying to convince whats-her-face not to leave him.
oh yeah, tiberian twilight.... that abomination
In Next Generation, we've yet to get the the episode where whats-her-face goes with Q.
Gold_Demona: also, do you like Picard? :3
Heh, those parachutes looked like falling boulders
rape of the franchise and a kick in the face for every c&c fan on the planet
MadSurge: Picard is best captain. Sisco is most badass captain.
05^^^^^^
I really want C&C 3 and kanes wrath
cant get over cisco's weird way of talking
TIME WARP
Dark_Horst: I could listen to Sisco talk all day. :3
LET'S DO THE TIME WARP AGAAAAAAIINNNN~
Gold_Demona: it's probably becasue i gre up with the gemrna dub, he doesnt do that there
LOL, I think of this song everytime time warp is activated in KSP. XD
Above all else, I cant wait to use an epic unit
I've read so much about them:)
mammoth mkII was most epic unit
Dark_Horst: Yeah. I could see where it would be a little jarring, lol.
DaringDerpy: MARV still better tho...:)
hm?
tab fail, sorry
hm...
Dark_Horst: MARV is way better than the mkII
oh that was fun
2,14 you little fucker
well that was close..
2,14 denying me my revenge
lol
Haha :D
what did I do to you? D:
Caramel: what are you playing?
COH
2,14 Company of Heroes
Again?
kewlio

well im ok with them
Up for another?
2,14 mmm, think I'm done with CoH for now
same here I need to order pizza :P
Ok cheers for playing with me
yeah good game
Caramel: In the event that I come into ownership of a pc game that people are okay with streaming, and say, a mod is streaming that very same game, how would I go about playing a match with said mod?
2,14 uh...
Racing them and reporting your progress every 6 minutes.
:/
2,14 you ask if they want to play with you...?
Caramel: that simple?
2,14 pretty much
DoctoDoctorWho Well for example i played tribes ascend with wrek quite a bit back in the summer and we owned the score boards in most matches so yes if they want you can ask
2,14 though I'm going to say this now
2,14 don't buy a game just to get streamed
2,14 that wont end wel
^
eeyup
unless it's crash bandicoot
Caramel: definitly not, that would be a waste of time and money
Reminds me of Phase with Magicka.
Lol did you buy Magicka Jmo? :D
The only reason I come here is to stalk the mods in the games they play! :/

It looks silly but I have to admit they are adorable -lol
Caramel: is there really that big of a differance?
MadSurge depending on which mode..
yes put the child in a box hide it's uglyness!
Old Rainbow Dash was already a slut :D
2,14 you really don't know crimson?
lip sink is worse than anime
2,14 allow me to educate you
what lip sync?
2,14 this is G3
i meant anime lip sink
Is this Machinima where they just bob their heads?
This is the BEST
oh...'
THEIR MOUTHS DON'T MOVE :D

FUUUUCCCKKK NOOOOOOO
There as to be a lip sink attempt for there to be lip sink.

This is called the Core 7.
2,14 this is G2
Finally.
flutterchu: because these cartoons came after G3
I WANT G1
OH NO
adrea dos the voice of 2nd best pony on gen3
:O
I REMEMBER THIS ONE
Caramel: You are incorrect sir. This is the second series of G1. G2 had no cartoon
Once again, mistaking G1.5 for G2
MY
FAVORITE
I LIKE THIS SONG
this song <3
Hehe, what's this song again? :3
:D poor George Harrison
No caramel this is G2
pmv's on gen 2?
MY MUM PLAYS THIS SONG
huh?
2,14 Gold_Demona yeah no, but try harder
My favorite song ever!
HUH?
flutterchu, at that point it would be AMV
Gold_Demona, whoever made this video is making the same mistake
I love it!
AdamTheDuck: it's "Here comes the sun" :D
The G2 toys came out AFTER this cartoon. This is still G1
:'(
2,14 and this is G1
MadSurge, I should've guessed :D
NOOOOOO
legend has it if you type "Sea ponies" 5 times in chat the mods will be forced to play it. But it's only a legend so....
Why!!!!
G1 had megan G2 was trying to get the now teenagers who used to watch the show back watching it focused around school and boys and shit.
cant tell the diffrence
>not showing seaponies for G1
Thank God moopy isn't here right now. He would be bitching away as always about the other G's -_-
Shoo be doo~
G1! :3
gen 1 is actually not bad
ISHYGGIDY
OH YER
G2 had no cartoon. Only toys
MORE
2,14 there, now you can tell the difference
Crystaline_Shard, that's G1.5
ahh the pilot episode of gen 1
G3 was the direct to video stuff.
the ponies that started it all
Gold_Demona, there was also a computer game
Caramel: teach these foolish ignorants
2,14 so now when I troll you with newborn cuties, I expect to see "Oh god not G3.6!"
G4 is FIM duh.
anyone else remember the gmod video that had this song in it?
the G2 toys hadn't started yet when Pony Tales came out
we need some g4
Look ppl, its the origional rarity!
It was still G1
Caramel: now go back to rainbow sex :D

Ninjazz, maybe some of the non-streamers can answer your question
Genderswap yay :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-By6LgCufDc
ok..
Very well. This "open stream" thing on iTunes. This is an audio thing and what is the url to input?
Ninjazz, are you trying to watch the stream from iTunes?
Kandarihu, trying to find better options to watch the stream at all.
Cya everypony
Later DerpyMuffins.
later DerpyMuffins
Bye DerpyMuffins
Ninjazz, well the stream is an embed from one of several streaming video sites such as mips.tv, limev, veemi and others.
take care DerpyMuffins
If you go directly for the video in your iTunes, I doubt it would make things better.
nice, AdamTheDuck
bye DerpyMuffins
Hmmm. That's unfortunate.
I guess I'll still be missing the steams then. -_-

Magnum > Rex
I like how Rarity is a Lady and yet can kick some serious ass :D
DINKY :D

Adam
mfw Dinky kills everypony
RaveBrony, yes.

Ninjazz: Rarity Forever! (\

Trixie put on her robe and wizard hat
goddamn magic shield
XD
/me puts on his robe and wizard hat...
RaveBrony: she's still the same annoying pony she was at the start. infact any charactor groth she has is quickly dropped between episodes.
If anything, i would say FS needs more character growth :( shes still so shy even after that one ep.
Wait.. How'd you die Phase4? o.o
AdamTheDuck, i have no clue
it said trixie had a sentry...
Hax
Flutter does need more but at least she had some.

Ohai PinkieSpice
On site embedded's too laggy for me to watch.
hello
So looking for alternatives that /might/ work better.
/me gives Kurra another hoof rub
/me noms on Dark92Enigma
Ninjazz, what media players do you have installed?
Phase4, basic Windows Media Player 3 or so, VLC, and QuickTime and all that stuff iTunes came with, off the top of my head.
/me is actually curious to see if there is any other alternative to site's stream as well
i'm winning
rtmp://mips.tv/live/bsmipsbackup
put that in vlc
Hmmm. Where?
Ninjazz, 'open network stream'
Okai. I'll look.
Phase4, can't be opened.
Ninjazz, try bsbackupmips

Can't be opened as well.
Hang on. I'll update this thing first then retry.
