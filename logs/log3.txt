Rawr, Skype appears full of fail.
y?
Does not allow to download without an account and is apparently unable to register me on the website <.<
sawie
So it tells me to register through the client, which I can not download, since I do not have an account D:
make one
I can't, I need the client to register. <.<
:|
|:
when i did it i just went to www.skype.com then downloaded and etc
I go to download, which does not download, but redirects me to registering D:
i dunno
i'm not a tech person
Then I try to register, which tells me that it failed to do so and tells me to download the client and register through that instead, which continues to the same loop.
Anyone willing to make me $2? ^^
No.
Noone is.
Aww, but they'd get $20 D.
D:
Nyuu
I don't want it
Okay!

07What's required for it?
An exam that in 2 hours
starts*
I should probably do some decentish artstuffs >:3
07Hm
07Well
07"Birth of Venus" <-
07this one, I'm slightly familiar with
oooo aaaaah
14you're name
07Yes?
14it's lowered case for once ._.
07Oh meep
07I should change that xvx
14you didn't notice?
14LOL
07thanks for letting me know
07No LOL
14eh, no problem :3
14hmm Kipi?
Oh and it was made in freso/Italian Renaissance style
14the Renaissance, lots of art depicting Greek/Roman myths and legends
14yes
14that, it beautiful :3
:o
that's looks awesome sir!!
/me likes it
14<Kipi> Some of the art we'll be going over included the "Crucifixion", "Holy Trinity", "Birth of Venus", "Gate of Paradise", "Santo Spirito", "Last Supper", "David", "The Sistine Chapel", "School of Athens", Tempietto", Tempest", "Villa Rotunda", "Madona with the Long Neck", "Garden of Early Delights", "Isenheim Altarpiece", "Tres Riches du Duc de Berry", and the "G <-- oh yeah?
D: i want a picture!
oh
14Last Supper, Da Vinci
You want a picture? :o
Ghend Altarpiece
XP I know the obvious ones
ya :3.
14ghend altarpiece?
14never heard of that one
That's the last one that was cut off
14hmm
It's a triptych piece. The only one at the time that opens up twice.
07Gate of paradise.
14I've seen Ghend Altarpiece, but I can't recall where
14but I've definiately seen it
14in a book or something
The gates of paradise were sculpted by.... Barricianno, I think. About 1460, and.... it was named such because some guy said the doors were so beautiful, they "could be the very gates to paradise".
I was wrong
Mew D.
Ghibertu built it between 1424-1452
:q
Next one?
14Tempest
X.x
Giorgianno
No idea on what the date could be
14check your answer?
After I answer
It was done in the Northen Italian Renaissance style. One important fact about it was that the picture symbolized that everything must come to an end, except... Jesus and Mary; from Mary, comes life
o~
Woo
I was right-ish
Except his name is spelled "Giorgione
1505-1510
Next? :3
hi, still at work so busy but reading anyway ^v^

14you're an Espeon

14lol
6stupid cheese
Yay :)
/me 6grabs Espeon and flophugs
6witches need cats
nuh D:
6I HAS ONE
6although

6I can never decide if espeon is a cat or fox |D
:)
This makes se- BLASPHEMY
/me love candies

twizzlers riiiigggghht? :3
14and if you can't really decide
lol
14there's me ._.
and he can eat her LIKE A CANDY :p
but really, the other Eeveelutions are rather "what are they?" to me as well, but Espeon is definitely a cat to me xD
6it's very catish, but the rest of the eeveelutions are foxish
xD
14eh
but i would melt in the sun
and get all sticky
14I say they're Norweigan
6and espeon's GSC sprite always seemed more foxish
6but yeh
Norwegian lolwut
6espeon can be a cat all it wants, it's still awesome
14norweigan cats
Norwegian forest cats = floof
that simple
8D

Fun.
14yes
6brees could chase their tails if they wanted D:
7are you /sure/ you're not Death?
6espeons would just catch theirs
/me chases Espeon's tail
The two tips makes it difficult you see, confusing to say the least.
7also, I just saw an add for a Guardians of Ga'Hoole movie and I get how cool it looks and everything, but dude... they're /owls/
7 /owls/

12lol drf, i love how the tracker for the HDMI cables states that it left california, then the next place it stopped was in wisconsin
but I see where your confusion comes from, it's really not that obvious
/me murrs
14Let's see, I've found where to lock a thread.
14:P
12for some reason i highly doubt it made a straight trip from california to wisconsin without stops by car
02First, you need to be mean to everybody who doesn't agree!
D:
/me hides
6all of the modding buttons are on the bottom
I disagree.
& Aurora
Aurora: Nothing on the bottom for me, only like modify/delete any post o.O
6you should see a merge button
but then again, non-global moderators != moderators, technically we're normal users with extra permissions.
/me gives Espeon some glasses
6but merge doesn't work atm |D
14uhh
02Cool
14what
6wait
/me puts on his Shades
6board mods might not have merge
oh lol WUT
it is all the way at the bottom
but my point still stands.
sort of
14Buh? O.o
02Cookies are evil?
14Merge is where?

12i know it doesn't even make sense
6espeon has it apparently
02prove it!
14Arti, maybe I wasn't expecting it where it was.
14For example, my moderator adjustments in the sprite gallery:
14It was pretty obvious from the main page
6sometimes obvious isn't the answer
6you do have the powers though, right?
It should be when it comes to interfaces
/me dies
12Oh um, check any topic in the boards you mod
again
12See if you have options to lock tc.
128etc

14I want to go to a gay pride parade
02Ne neither....
03though tbh
03why do they use the term "phobic"
03that's supposed to mean *afraid of*
14because
03not *dislikes*
03that's just stupid
14drf
02It is afraid...
03no it's not
14think of the mormons for a sec
Back!
03homophobic is a term for hating gays
6NO
6ABSOLUTELY NOT
14they're highly against gays and lebians
6we are not bringing religon in here
02ORLY...?
03that's like saying clausterphobic means you hate being in small spaces
6considering that's pretty much /my/ religion
6thank you
03the term "phobic" means *afraid of*
whut
14because it ruins their plans of their erm
03but somehow the term homophobic doesn't mean that o.o
14well I dunno what's it called
02Whut?
14but in jehovah witness term, their "great ressurection"
:D
6>.>
14I guess
4People hate that which they fear, people fear that which they do not understand.

14yes
02:(
02o3o

14you know
14my mom was the same way
I prefer short haired girls.
14and you both happen to be the same height
hyphen.
02PUBERTYSUCkS
/me hides
14blonde as can be when young, then your hair turns brown
My hair's been the same for about nineteen years or so lol.
And I've only existed for some of that time.
02same with my sisters
12My hair's always been the same too :3
02Me too
12and I'm just back to say I'm going for longer XD
12Seeya soon ^v^
6awww
02Hm?
14I've always been a natural brown :3
03wait ARti's leaving? :<
02I've always had black
02Or dark
6oh and then my hair can't decide if its wavy or straight
My hair's pretty black lol
/me can't decide on his hair colour
Same color as my eyes, I think.
12hmm
6the top hairs are straight, the hair underneath though is wavy as heck
02Same here
It's just like those imitation leather seat coverings.
6as soon as I do my usual hair style, you see the curls lol
It looks black at first, then you shine a really bright light at it
and then discover it's just dark purple.
02Dark Brown at the "fringe"
My hair's like that only less expensive.
02My hair costs 25$ every three months
Ten dollars every three or four months versus a car.
02Or 4 months
lol
02I went over 6 months once...
02It was LOONG
02Too long
Once mine reaches a certain length it gets ridiculous to comb.
I hate it.
Because then I have to spend ten bucks.
I don't know how people deal with hair over like, two centimeters long.
02HML HAIR PIC
02-1 min
My sanity is inversely proportional to my hair's length.
14Roara

6I work on open offic these days
6*office
10They never offered foreign languages in high school for you, Aurora?
/me teaches Aurora the awesome language of the bree
14open office?
02I have to learn Spanish
o_o
6skylands, it's required to learn a new language
yeah I was gonna say
if Roara didn't have to learn a new language
6as for whether or not I actually learned it, I at least /passed/
"FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF!"
10Oh
6I never caught on though
02I can't learn a new language....
6I could learn enough for the tests, but my mind doesn't connect the language well
10you meant fluently
02I just remeber it all
14yeah.. new language
02why not HML?
14feh
14they offer NO FRENCH
14and only Spanish
14I consider this racisit
6although, I'm pretty decent reading and writing it
02EWWWW FRENCH CLASSS
6more reading though
10Most people have to be surrounded around the given language to understand it well
10BACK
02reading too
6I know terms better than actually putting them into sentences
02Same
10Same here
6yeah, my friend is majoring in spanish now, she learned pretty well
02:(
6she just got home from study abroad in spain
10but Spanish 3 requires alot of sentences, so I'm steadily learning new things

02Eeeek...

10I find it easy so far
02Oh boy...
02same, im practicing my grammar on a NOT school course
10then again, it's only first semester
6the hardest thing is learning conjugations that DON'T EXIST in english
10Mostly review from last year's class
02my schools english teacher... is badd
02Conjugating isn't too hard
02Well in M3/Grade 8 it wasn't
10I just wish they'd offer Japanese at my school
02LOL me 2
6I wouldn't take japanese anyways
6I'd still take spanish
10I might do better in that class, because I happen to be more interested in Japanese culture
6far more useful
I wish my high school didn't fail.
lol
02:o
02My high school is Hard
/me rubs Umbreon

10High school > Middle > Elementary
I did nothing for four years and graduated.
02<---------------------->
02LOL
02Middle was the best
02LOOOL
02Primary was Awsomeness
6I never went to elementary school
02And High School is a mental sanity test
02..........
6and i only had one year of middle
10Middle was too... cliquey
6so
6I dunno what to say about either
I don't remember middle school.
02You didn't?
hi
It might not have happened.
10Students were more concerned about their social life than anything else in middle
High school I hated.
6skylands, sounds like high school lol
12hi there quil
10At least, for my high school, people matured a bit
02Still hatin from day 1
02yeah, you are right sky
how is?
6see, once you get out of high school, everyone worries about classes again
I think I hated the world more in high school than I do now.
Which says a lot.
6it's awesome
02Everybody Dematured
:\
12i dunno
12on the bright side i got the epic deckbox
02:(
12:3
6see, in college, you can be cool outside of high school standards
10College sounds amazing from who I've heard from
6POKEYMANZ YES
02LOL
In college, you can be cool period. lol
Pokemon rocks ^^
6I can't explain how many people play pokemon lol
No one's allowed to be cool in high school.
02LOOOOOOOOL
02I know...
They ban you.
do not
6it was awesome walking into my flash animation class and hear "POKEMON BLACK AND WHITE JUST GOT ANNOUNCED" first thing
6I laughed
10lol
02I tried to make my friend look at the TST today....she didn't
02Tooo geeky for her
04lolRoara
10well, I think there are more Pokemon fans
04in that case
meh at high school
02Hi Kipi
10they just hid themselves
04I can't wait until college/university
/me sits on may
02:o
6you know
02I'm afraid
10or are the very old fans, and don't keep updated with the new stuff
6I had an image that describes this situation perfectly
College is where life stops sucking, imo.
02Really...?
You get to do stuff.
And people aren't retards.
It's great.
02STUFF?? NO RETARDS??
Well, most people.
lol
02What world do you live in?
6there we go :>
'w'
10I love that comic site
02LOL
04Saw that Roara XD
02So true...
6but see
6it's true LOL
12hmm
6because when you're in college
02Middle School was...
10College = rebirth
6everyone's way more expressive about pokemon
6so much more awesome
/me lays ontop of umbreon
Most of the idiots drop out if they do join
!umbreo
:o
!umbreon
:3
02I don't know how Pokemans was in Middle School
6"So far I've noticed that college is a lot like kindergarten, except everyone has a way higher capacity to seriously hurt themselves. " <-yep
!shipping
14Lol Roara
12eep
02Nobody really talked about it
02XD
14are they serious about that?
oh my :o
04XD
14is it REALLY what's it's like?
6about what?
14Pokemon. Ew Pokemon. POKEMON.
6dude, may, college is amazing
*shocked*
14I wanna go D:
02YEAH
02well at least the pokemon fans are low, but loyal at my school
6high school literally is its own world
14forget High school
02I know...
lol
:O
02And I have 4 years left
02:(
lol
02NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
OHMYGODIFORGOT
6in high school, you worry about popularity, what makes you "an outcast", clique stuff, etc
6graduating high school is entering life
04in college
04you don't give a damn
It's cool, eventually you'll forget all about high school.
Like me.
02I'm always a "outcast"...
6college, life 101, it's all different
trust someone to ave the same nick :3
It's like putting your hand on a hot stove for four years.
!shipping
Eventually you'll stop feeling it.
6my advice is DON'T SECLUE YOURSELF
6*seclude
oh meh god :o
02Maybe somebody will hate Apple, like Retro Stuff and ...
dammit.
14yeah, k
6be outgoing in college, and it wont matter what you like lol
02But it's my nature....
/me hides
I can't play some games because my computer came with an outdated graphics card
:3
Go to the right college.
I promised my highschool principal that I'd make a presentation at school about how highschool sucks and life gets better when you graduate and go to college
02<%Aurora> in high school, you worry about popularity, what makes you "an outcast", clique stuff, etc <--- FAKE, for me at least. i don't even care of other peoples think abaut me
02Me neither
14Aurora
14stay in college when I graduate
14so we can raid it
02XD
6you see, most people /say/ that, but in fact people /do/care
You won't have to seclude yourself if you hang around the right people.
6whether or not they admit it actually can't be helped sometimes
Thing is, in high school there's no such thing as the right people.
But college is different.
Because you can choose.
02"Right People" are hard to find here...
6the right people is however you decide you can trust
6I found that in people younger than me -_-
There are wrong people to trust.
02I have some old friends
Those are everywhere.
Like me!
:D
02They're NICE
Old friends don't always last. You need new ones once in a while.
02And the ocasionall Spanish Kid who says "Hola" every now and then

03that one's the best IMO
02....
14^
03but most people like 2003 so that's the one I'm hosting
I also found floppies of the suite before it was Office
02Thats better
just Powerpoint, Word, etc
I liked 03. After that they started being Apple.
14drf
2000 was the best
Awesome.
14PM me directions, actually
Fancying everything up and making it unusable.
I didn't really like 2K. It just felt rather... clunky.
02Just like Paint
02MICROSOFT OFFICE 2003 FTW!!!!!!!!!!
The new menu thing was pointless
02YEAH
2K3 is the one pour moi.
02I HATE WINDOWS 7 Paint
lol
03So do I HML
02XP is soo much better

02?>?
hm

02But I did do a small bit of spritetings with it
02Only a bit...
02Want to see my *fail*?
Paint is amazing for sprites.
I enjoy the woefully inadequate MS Paint that's in Windows XP. :P (That... and Adobe Photoshop CS3...)

-!- Newbie is a slang term for a newcomer to an Internet activity, for example online gaming. It can also be used to indicate an individual inexperienced in any other activity. It can have derogatory connotations, but is also often used for descriptive purposes only, without a value judgment.

Wouldn't that be conflict of interest? ;)
She thinks she's soooooooo cool because she's running that she doesn't have to talk to the little people
that makes it sound like you dom't like her =/
So why do you want to date her then? o.O
*don't
Oh, I'm being sarcastic :3
I tried to talk to her on the Facebook IM thingy and she didn't respond

02back
02</randomtopicthantnoboycarestime>
To Kill A Mockingbord is such a boring book.
02I'm at #16 on the chatstats now! MUAHAHA
When he went back in time and had a new chance at life, his best friend who he later slept with told him that he was incorrigible :3
02:)
Hopefully not the third definition
02Cool!
10Chatstats becoming a competition, lul
02lol
"Difficult or impossible to control or manage: an incorrigible, spoiled child."
02Yup...
02Ever since I came here
But when he had a chance to do things over again, he ended up as a junior officer for his whole career, never really taking the intiattive
:P
Captain Picard = spoiled child?
02My #1 Prioity was to get to a decent level...
10Don't worry, it's been going on for a long time before you came into the picture
He was 1 and 2

Probably because profile changes only update in pairs.

/me pulls out a flamethrower
02YOU Roll over >:O
:3
No u!
I mean really
It's frikkin' ridiculace
12so i can start round 3 XD
Why?
Because
I know you do, glac
/me jumps into TG, and rolls all over hime
Greed is costing people's lives
12doesn't everyone?
easy as that
We HAVE resources
Who will I face in round 3 if I win?
lol
02ME
12dunno yet
12it's random
We just use oil instead of other products
you think the rich and powerful give a fuck if we 'have' resources?
Which is retarded
K
No
Unfortunately
12no guarentees
the claiming of more resources, and profits for their markets is that concerns them
But someone, SOMEONE should step up and say that it's enough
if people die, then they die
12or you will randomly be paired down
just that then we're viewed as 'extremists'
'terrorists'
12since there will be 3 undefeated people
if one person steps up and says no, 100 others will step up and try to kill them
the correct term being 'communists' :P
Dude, they die BECAUSE OF THE WAR
and lol
How about this
which happens repeatedly
Mmhmm
and no
We take a look at our damn constitution
12but yeah
and our 'god give rights' ;p
12if you won
And tell the polititions that they're blinded by greed
but really, when has the constituion been...good?
Don't you love how you always kill the main chat when you talk to me?
In fact I say we make a mile-long petition
A lot of times actually
12don't give me too much credit
Just noticed
After amended
before?
12it's a bad time
Protecting rights and what not
No
lol
02XD....
protecting rights?
:P
Yeah
It's written there
But nobody cares >_>
Yea, tell that to the Japanese prisoners, or African civil right leaders, or even muslims today
Honestly
about how they are 'protected'
in a true word we have 10 privilges
which can be easily taken away if we are a threat to their regime o3o
Someone should get a polotition and make him feel pain like death
*politition
a right, can not be taken away
a privilge, can
12hmm
12only 2 people haven't won a match yet
thats the difference
Lol
True
12that makes pairings easier XD
Still
Higher ups seem to think this: $
Is more valuable than this
<===
thats how class conflict works
they dont care about you as a person
object
or tool
Exactly
you're just a thing to be used
They care about money
untill your done
And that's fvcked up
Amirite?
been that way for 500 years
its been fucked up
Yep
12it's hard to keep this tournament managed, i have to keep track of who has fought who, and what everyone's battle record is
That REALLY needs to be changed
12after round 4 i have to calculate everyone's resistence
night all
Well you wont find it in a president
reformism =/= change
Unfortunately -_-
02Night
Ya know
reformism = being the dogs to the higher class
nighttt.....
or cats
I think everyone's gonna die soon
or whatever animal suits the position
Really
Gee, I wonder who that is
what, think that a nuclear apoloclypse will come?
^
Because we're gonna end up killing ourselves through lack of common sense :E
02I don't know?
night everyone....im off
No
02Bye
02Definatly not LL
Bye...?
I think people will go to war until every man is drafted
Good, for that'd be silly
yes :)
02Oh...
And resources will be deminished
Thats only if the war is important enough to the goverment
02Interesting
...i pretty amazing..soo im told
Lol
03LOL
They think anything with money is importaint
02?.?
02Huh?
they know this
AS OF RIGHT NOW PEOPLE ARE KILLING EACHOTHER FOR LAND
HOW STUPID IS THAT
they'll just leave them to die
nvm
02Byez
well consider the south o3o
12sigh
night
12i wish i had a problem who would do this for me
12XD
?
the South killed mexicans for more land and slaves
12oh well not very often i hold tournaments
thats how Texas was formed
And is that good?
Bo
*no
Never said it was
You're destroying lives for your own personal gain
just an example of people killing for land
03hm, lame
That's been going on for years and it's both sick and pointless
12?
03I can only get $13 Amazon credit for this Mastering Physics code?
03They're worth $40 >_>
02Lame...
I really hope my generation has some brains that will fix up our planet
12x-x
03I want to sell mine
If not
12take it somewhere else/
12?
03as I didn't realize I don't need *another* code sinice I paid last year
I don't care what the hell happens to me
03yeah but who randomly buys access codes?
I'm blowing up the white house
/me shot
Nah
12if amazon would take it
02Codes for what?
12you should be able to find it somewhere else
03Mastering Physics
03it's a physics thing for universities
03where we do online homework
But I do want action to be taken
/me is sick of the world :E
02Why is that so?
Because people keep killing eachother for their own gain
And it makes me sick
o3o
Drake; so hows the lulz?
04?
04haven't read it
04busy
See: Iraq, Iran, and Afganistan
Why the frik are we there in the first place?!

Ask bush :p
02yeah....
Obama doesn't care either.
02He should watch Pokemon 2000...
02</badkjoke>
No
He should listen to War Pigs
And evey other anti-war song
Because those address how RETARDED the office is
03dude, they're politicians
03end of story
03politicians can't be smart, it defies all laws of physics
XD
02XD
Well then
Let's pull a french
/me shot
(completely reshaping our government)
Seriously
*SOMETHING* has to change
02We need... I don't know
I say everyone who's IQ is below 100 is sent off to a different area of the world
Preferrably a large area like Russia :P
02AND WE RENAME IT Genoica
Then we rehash our government and make it so we don't suck so horridly

03no it's not
12i heard of so many chefs in that show
Drugs are detrimental
12double dipping as well
03and ownership scripts are detrimental to one's IO
The owning script is someone having a pet for a while
03*IQ
03Your point?
12they'll taste their food with a spoon or something then put the spoon back in the dish
That

03<LeeSD> yeah, gotta work down the addiction ladder
03<LeeSD> she's been clean for 4 years, it was before we met
03<Godzilla> Ooh wow, then I was kidding bout my oxycontin joke… -_- WoW that was bad of me
03<LeeSD> haha, whatever, doesn't bug me in the slightest
03<LeeSD> she needed something to concentrate on because she couldn't go outside and see anyone, because everyone she knew was into dope
03<tueidj> WoW - perfect for someone who doesn't have a job, friends or family

Make the tetris script give no line pieces :=

I think all the fanboys/girls hate it because it was diverted too much. But it's a book-to-film adaptation, what do you expect?

2drf: okay, so I installed OpenSUSE on my laptop, its a dual boot with Windows 7
yeah, it's gonna blow up the world
If it exists.
2but now, thing is, when I use OpenSUSE to try and connect to my wifi. it doesnt connect at all
:O
Even then, we won't be alive to see that. The supervolcanoes will get us first. xD
but, but, but, the TV said it did!
03that's a driver issue
Quiet
2oh, I see.
2hm..I suspected so
Or the dinosaurs
They're not sure if it actually exists.
If it does, our concept of mass and photons is all wrong.
2hm..do you know how to get ndiswrapper configured then? sorry I'm a bit of a beginner at Linux~
03not really :/
03I have an Intel wi-fi chip and it just works
2ouch,kays~
2thanks tho
/me has a wirless dongle
2the only thing I dislike about Linux is its wi-fi issues. other then that its awesome
12O_O
12Hyper
02From Amazon of course
02What LL?
12I misread that...
so would that make that app a scam?
Haha, it /always was/ a scam.
App?
I heard app
Itouch app
An app used to create matter
LOL!!
02Of course you did...
didn't you know about it?
I have Wi-Fi work perfectly
I use Ubuntu
yes, you can touch this app
:P
2oh, I see..
On an OLD LAPTOP
:E
2is Ubuntu good?
Yes very
You can even taste it.
Yes
02Nao?
2okay..
Every app on this iPod is eatable, even I am eatable.
2I might be tempted to switch to that~ :D
Except for the fact that apple hates it
You can use it for pretty much anything
I can't see why a lot of people say it's bad though
02:(
no
That makes it good
03it does XD
02It's too niche'
No iTunes syncing
03EW ITUNES
The earbuds taste like earbuds!
XD
That's why I didn't like it
02EWWW
Yeah
2Apple=money grubbers
03Ubuntu 10.04 supports iPods, therefore it fails in my eyes :(
Earbuds are eatable?
iPod touch
Shut up drf LOL
/me is nommed~
02O_0
Nummy
Like I said, everything is eatable.
It works as a perfect alternative
And drf realize this
But eating other people is called cannibalism, my dear children...
Are pancakes eatable?
2lol
...and is frownded upon in civilized nations.
12he doesn't mind the fruit
*frowned
If a product doesn't appeal to almost every end user
2Umbreon: O.o. I see
You lose customers
031. Ubuntu is free
Even though Ubuntu is free LOL
/me returns
03what "customers"
03they arne't paying
... XD
/me gets shot
12i don't know what he thinks about big macs from mcdonalds though
032. Linux hardly appeals to anyone but hardcore techies anyway
02XD
03and what the frick hardcore techie likes Apple
02True
Awww
03therefore I rest my case.
02Nobody
Good point
Hehe, flapjacks.
D:
but...
I like pancakes
2drf: so basically, Linux are for hardcore techies only? O.o
What if they're chocolate chip?
02OF COURSE
I just ate them for breakfast this morning
It's for the great good, people!
/me shot
*greater
2LOL! Okay..
doesn't chocolate make all that was once eatable into something that is eatable?
*uneatable
:P http://www.theonion.com/articles/un-appoints-first-ambassador-to-aliens,18195/
02Why would you want a pengiun to be the mascot of your OS?
Chocolate certain has leverage in this argument, but I'm not sure it can overturn the Law Of Eatable Properties.
*certainly
Hm
Well Ubuntu IS free
So
Since people would want an OS they don't need to pay for
They could probably get that
And then use whatever MP3 player they have with it
Preferrably NOT an iPod but still xD
"In the past, the aliens had to take themselves out to Red Robin, and that is just unacceptable."

!Umbreon

12lol
PASTA?
Spycheck!!!!!!!11
PASTAAAAAAAA?
02Take that
02PIZZAPIE
I have a foolproof meathof of recording videos and proving them to be real
Record using 2 cameras
02OLRY?
/me runs
No
12remember them?
12and say what happened
03dude
2 of them
03you could photoshop a camera
03that proves nothing
LISTEN!
03NO
MY GOD
>_>
F*ck you
/me flees
03I know what you're getting at but you could easily fake that
12speak your mind
K
You record the event with both cameras
When the event is over turn off ONE camera
And show yourself uploading the video to Youtube
Or something
03which then involves uploading the second video
03which could easily be faked
Then end the proof video and upload that
:E
...
03to make it look like you filmed a video of you filming a video
It shows the process of you filming
03yeah but you could easily fake that
And then uploading RIGHT WHEN IT'S DONE
no
I mean
03.....
03OMG you are so naive
03Have you ever heard of PAUSING?
Thw second the video is done you upload it
Yes
03yeah and what I'm saying is the second video could be entirely fake
03as in
... YOU DO THAT
12and that is the lapse that has no video evidence
03yea
03h
03Umbreon knows what I'm getting at
Gah
03I could shoot a video of myself taking a camera, taking the memory card, putting it in my computer and uploading it
02I haz a Coolpix P1
I mean no pausing in the video whatsoever
LOL: *picture of Obama* Black Guy Asks Nation For Change.
12even if you turn the first camera on
03I could also put an entirely fake video on that memory card
03therefore FAKING THE ENTIRE THING
12there is still a moment where one of the cameras is off
02Hmm...
MY FFFFING GOD
12and you can't prove only like 5 seconds passed between turning a camera on and off
THE WHOLE VIDEO HAS NO PAUSE
we saw a bumper sticker like that the other day
03HOW CAN YOU PROVE THAT YOU DIDN'T USE PAUSE
02NO pAUSE... MADNESS
12then even if you do
okay
02!madness
"When he's done all you'll have left is change"
Tell me how I can pause perfectly
:P
On both videos
Tell me that
03you only need to pause on one
Still
03you pause as soon as you turn the camera off...
03the first camera
03then go edit the video
03and resume
12the best way to prove something
03it's really not rocket science
Tell me how the transition can be 100% accurate
03Did you not hear what I JUST said
...
Yes
12is to say what happened and have video evidence, don't go out of your way to try breaking people will call it fake, its their loss if they don't believe you
03you use a video editing program
But
03make an entirely fake video
03put it on your camera's memory card.
I have to be in the same position
03Then make a video of you supposedly filming it
Same EVERYTHING
03and you show you putting the memory card in your computer
03which has a *FAKE* video on it
but what if the proof video is attached to my shirt or somethig?
Well, I must heet hay.
12why are we even arguing this guys?
night Neeawn
2Objection
12the thing is
12that there is ways to look at a video
Because people seem to think anything and everything is fake
Which is sad
See ya
12and tell if it was tampered with or not
03because it IS fake
/me runs
12people can actually analyze that
Shut UP drf
I MEAN IT
And yes Umbreon
/me coughs *oversensitive*
No
STFU
12there are professionals who make a living doing that sort of
You just don't know when to be quiet sometimes
02MAN SHADDIUP....
Yes bree
/me throws a cup of STFU at drf
Now listen
I never let the proof video be still
rawr
So if it's paused in the slightest you'd be able to make that out
03you're underestimating just how easy it is for someone to find flaws
Drf
What the hell makes you think there WOULD be flaws?!
03because no video is 100% guaranteed to be not fake
03for example
03you say you never sit still... I'd hate to see you upload a video to YouTube
03say you sit down in your chair
03pause the second camera
03go edit the first video
03on another computer
03then just sit back down, resume
03it's really not rocket science...
07because the harder someone tries to make it look as real as possible, that just raises more suspicion that it's fake
07o3o
'Night, jive turkeys.

>_>
03minus teh face
02XD
Seeya on the flipside.
02{}3{}
x)
Night code monkeys
02[]3[]
Gah
No see
The problem is
There's always a skeptic
Like DRF
:p
/me fleea
Anyway
07you know that old saying
03I'm just saying you're naive about the whole "I CAN PROVE I DIDN'T FAKE IT"
07haters gonna hate
07=P
well, just Lady....only ever had the one girlfriend
CODE MONKEY
03because it's easy to fake even a 'proof' video
and not even she calls me Mr. Snuggles
03most of those are fake...
03does anyone care? No, they're still entertaining
02:o
I'm trying to develop a meathod that breaks that
-_-
Not that damn it
03well you just keep trying
03because it's not gonna happen
I mean other stuff
07basically the best way to say it isn't fake is to just tape it, upload it, and say nothing at all
But you know what?
Neverming
*d
03who's with me
/me hides
02:LOL
07that's the only way to get the smallest amount of people who would say it's fake
>_>
03yeah exactly
ooooh
03like the guy who filmed the video of that PS3 Jailbreak thing
03he made a second video showing his first one wasn't fake
03what happens
03more people say it's fake
03XD
is mr. snuggles the g-rated version? :o
:p
But why
That's just stupid
12and verify that all the games are there
03but why what?
depends on the amount of clothing involved
Snuggling has no set requirements
You're trying to prove something real so people won't act retarded goin "LOL FAKE."
12i would be extremely greatful if you can provide this for me
What's the problem in that
03no, people thought his first one was fake because he never showed the PS3 during the process
12people will always be ignorant
12even with all the proof in the world
07it would just be EXTREMELY difficult to pull it off
12they will still choose to call it fake because they don't want to believe it
07but it could still be faked
12and nothing but
i see, i see.
Indeed, glac
03basically, the only way to prove that it's not fake, is to see it with your own eyes.
Why does Adobe's products have to exist
03Period.
03who the frick uses Adobe for video editing?
Or any video editing software for that matter
>_>
Ahhhhhh!!!!! Spider!!!!

12and stopped reading them
oh :o

isnt 8 legged freak a movie?
10have you even TRIED reading? XD
yes
03yeah but see
03Yeah I have
03and what ends up happening
glad you know of it
That's why I wanted to find a meathod to somehow prove it to be real without some idiots claiming it fake
:|
03is I zone out and go "WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?>!>!?!?!?!?!?"
03so instead I prefer listening to someone read it to me
02!ew Books
12EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW BOOKS
03No zoning out, etc.
:3
03and then I can multitask
10You must be speed reading then
10or just bad at reading LOL
12i have a hard time following some literature
pretty decent movie from what I remember, bout on par with Evolution

Do not! D:<
12we see the planet with 5 senses
/me brbs
02we are fakers
Do TOO!
12however each of these senses can be fooled
03Just do what everyone else does and just upload the stupid thing
12one way or another
And science can't explain everything
I just don't want to upload something that's true and have eeryone go "you f***ot" "f*** you liar"
Etc
02What was he going to upload again?
That happens on a LOT of vids
03ever heard of deleting comments?
12don't let them get to you
07pfft
12you aren't uploading the video to please everyone
12because pleasing everyone is impossible
07even people who do believe it's real would post those things just to be jerks lol
02What is the video about???
nini :3
12use reverse psychology
I call that the trololo theory.

Things!
12the deck has been climbing and climbing in price
Poor Things
He's so mistreated
12if you buy it at 100, and the price rises to say 110, you just made a 10 dollar profit
is it even awaketime in Aussieland?
things is currently impersonating elvis atm. leave a message at the tone and he will never get back to u
6you wont sell it though, you just want it |D
12true

You'll wake him up
almost afternoon?

If you disagree with my beliefs that dragons exist[ed], you can keep your
opinions to yourself instead of trying to argue against me. Not like you're
going to change my beliefs anyways, so don't waste your time trying.
Raaaaaaaaaa
"I have a right to my opinion, but if you disagree SHUT UP!"
totally
6raaaaaaaaa
6aa
that's how over half the internet is
I dont even think they were talking about religion in that thread
he just likes to bring it up whenever he wants
Yeah
yip
but of course if someone else brings it up, he says that talking about religion isn't allowed
because he's a [censored]ing moron
"IF YA DISAGREE WIT MEH TEHN YA CAN KEEP QUIET AND WHATEVER"
then it's OK
no, that's SR
10-.-
:o
Oh yeah
xP

41 of which from me
6oh yeah I saw that |D

He definitely hasn't read it then
because he obviously hasn't read it
Where are they?
:P
the other is from the authorities they're onto you
Ah right
:P
run things!!!!
so he's not as faithful to his religion as he's pretending to be, or that's how I see it
lmao
Uh oh
I think that if he thinks so strongly about it he should actually know what it's about
oh hai where
/me has forgotten where he put Things
Hey where
Things!
:D
I agree

My teacher st school wants me to make him one, I've bought the domain and stuff

6my TV is a beast
12so i can get behind and switch the power tap with one of those surge protectors you gave me
12XD
6I'm scared to move it
:D
03*heavy
03well

03the one I have here is a 32" LCD
03I hate LCDs but :/
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlBiLNN1NhQ
03anything else was "too big" and tooe xpensive
03I got this thing for $400
12400 isn't bad
03at home we've got a 50" plasma, that's seriously amazing
03yeah
03I love ABC Warehouse for that
o___o;
03you can barter with them XD
12lol
03their list price was like $450
:o
03and I was all "eh, that's a bit pricy" and the guy was like "tell you what, I'll give it to you for $400"
03I was like OK
12i'm curious what happens
Preggers are very dangerous creatures
12if you plug a surge protector into a surge protector
12lol
You can't be too careful
03absolutely nothing
03I'm doing it right now
12you never know until you get a power spike
03LOL
03well I'm in a dorm, I doubt we're gonna have that problem
apparently there'sa huge lice breakout here
I love not going to school
Eww
especially for stuff like that
:D
12i'm just curious if you double them up, if it doubles the amount of spike that will go through
One of my friends in 5th grade had lice
03it shouldn't
She didn't come in for a few days
>.<
03I mean, if you plug like, 15 of them in to each other
03then yeah
03but just plugging one into another should be fine
Apparently now they're saying you should still go to school if you have lice
Bleh
Who has Skype?
lol people are [censored]ing idiots
XD
12lol
03I'm serious
/me read that in a newspaper
03all my lights are plugged into one outlet
I can just imagine it in like 3 years
03which is then connected to a timer
03and we haven't had a fire yet so I'm good XD
IF YOU HAVE A DEADLY DISEASE THAT'S CATCHABLE YOU SHOULD STILL GO TO SCHOOL!!!!!
I don't see any situation where I could not go to school
Deadly?
Lice are deadly
12imagine the horror drf, when parallel circuits weren't invented yet
in a couple years
oh they are?

interesting
Lol no

12XD
03LOL
03dude
A little bit
03they are o.o
:O
Our attendance policy punishes people who don't go to class, no matter what reason it is
MAYBE IF THEY GET TO THE PUBES
03until VERY recently
03think about it
/me is shot from everyone in the room
03when you pull a light out
03the whole strand dies
03that's proof that they're wired in series
Someone last year got out of class by emailing the teacher and saying he had Swine Flu
12hmm i never had that happen
when I was in elementary school my mom would just pull me out saying I had a doctor appointment
12the the fact that "darnit... i have this cord of like 300 light bulbs, one of them is out...
I love elementary school getting outs
12"
03I'm not talkinga bout burned out
12i know
03I mean if you straight up pull a bulb out
"Life's a piece of [censored], when you looke at it. Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true. You'll see it's all a show, keep 'em laughin' as you go, just remember that the last laugh is on you! So always look on the bright side of life!"
12taking it out
*Look
I remember 5th grade there were only like 3 days a week that I'd actually stay the full day
o/
03k
12my electronics teacher was so fun
03like I know why they used to go out if a bulb burned out
I remember I hated my music teacher and my gym teacher
03and why they don't know XD
03*now
12i remember when he made us take apart old VCRs
Skype!
12mine still had a VHS tape in it and he saw me struggling to get the tape out
12he just walks upto me, picks up the VCR and drops it on the ground XD
/me is about to sleep
Damn.
I never liked my gym teacher either
or in high school
12ever watched national lapoon
I didn't like that gym teacher either
03some of them
lol like EVERYBODY hated my music teacher
03yeah
The only teacher I ever hated was my web design teacher
who made me use dreamweaver
:<
he thought that drumming on your stomache saying "teekee teekee tah tah" was music
we all [censored]ing hated him so much omg hahahah
XD
we had a pure evil librarian
All music teachers think that :P
my friend and I had theories about her evil plans to kidnap our other friend
I LOVED my librarian, during the summer when they had summer library checkout I'd stay at the school all day reorganizing the books people brought in and labelling the new ones
I never had any friends in school it was a great hobby for me
That would be a fun job I think

I only joined yesterday, Reshiram.

6I told myself i'd go to bed early tonight :/
6ok, I thought you might have been someone who name changed lol
/me 6hates that D:
6name change bugs me when people do it without warning me first >.<
12drat
07Reshiram, yeh
07Oh!
07I remember you
12maybe i should change back to umbreon D:
I don't think you've seen me.
I only joined yesterday.
03anyway Reshiram uploading this .zip to MegaUpload
03has like, 20 minutes left
07Well I saw you
Although, if you visit other networks, you might have seen me.
07but we didn't talk
Oh, yes, I used that nickname yesterday.
07So hi :>
6LOL 20 MINUTES
03my upload speed sucks :/
6think you can send that in a memo then? I really need sleep >.<
03um
Hi :)
03actually nvm
03lemme just do it this awy
6don't you have like awesome speed o-o
03*way
03I do
03but
03they make the upload go reeeeaaaally slowly unless it's in an email or for a university purpose
03stupid evil MAFIAA >_>
6....mafia lol
03it's MPAA and RIAA
03combined
03I call them MAFIAA
03so yeah
6legit
03there
03might go slowish
6I saw some car plastered with mafia stickers
6I had to laugh
03that's downloading it directly from my hard drive
6I'd never seen that before
6omg that speed x-x
03is it going slow?
6quicker results.....how exactly to pieced rars work?
03you need all the parts
03and you extract part 1
03it relies on the other ones
6I downloaded each rar and extracted them
6eh
03the reason why
03is it's extracting all 6
03each time
03XD
03you did download all 6, right?
Nah.
6ok, so I essentially just have to extract from one then, right?
03yes
6just have all 6 downloaded
6ok
6that makes way more sense
Meh!

Helping a company with a bad reputation get a good one by helping them find problems with their latest product. Well, threads about unhappy customers.

I'm reporting threads with unhappy customers to another person who will do his best to make the customer happy.
I've seen this, Proto how much do they offer?

02What did you say?
14huh?
just told her a ridiculous story about today's school adventure that im mad about >.>
02BILL! I mean hi May
14D:
/me dubs HML as Sookie and is on her way~
/me runs
02I was owned by a spider yesterday..
this boy in my health class decided he was gonna be funny and take WhiteOut and see what happens when he wipes the brush on my BLACK hoodie, (now this hoodie, is by far, MY FAVORITE hoodie, its a black monster hoodie what says MD in monster lettering -Maryland-) and now i have a giant white line on my black hoodie
14lol
/me was Quoting Star Fox 64...
Ohai May </late>
02:(
my solution? i took whats left and dumped it aaaaall over his pants ^_^
02Poor hoddie
02LOL
/me doesn't have a single hoodie
then he got slapped XD
14I mean
not really May :/
14I probably would have done that
02But he needed "JUSTICE"!
14but, still
14there's more ways than just revenge
/me uses /me to type in roleplay format.
;o
in my school, when you do something to someone cause THEY did something to you, it registers in there head NOT to mess with you
/me wonders why
14well that's just silly, because, that's what high school to be everywhere
but IF you snitch, then more crap comes your way, half the highschoolers in my school are idiots anyway
02Oh high school...
/me answer with a simple 1I'm gunna go get my cocoa pebbles now.
02LOL
14you don't get back at them as a message "don't mess with me" it just gets worse, because it provokes for more annoyance >>
02Control K and black in a desciptor
14that just means responding is not the best thing
I know alot of stuff from my good ol' java user days ;D
14snitching is a choice, yes, but it doesn't mean trouble
02Or just quote the Terminator...
14or you can simply ignore him
14or tell him to back-off
14but it's way better than the way you responded to his acts
Beat the taturz out of him. :D
14just sayin'
02Should of done a...
lol hence why in 8th grade someone kept throwing crap in my hair, i told him to stop, he kept doing it, so i reached around grabbed his gatorade bottle on his desk and smacked him in the face with it ^_^ and the cap was open so it went AAAALL over him :D
02NO barrelrolls?
14trust me, I know
no
i had a problem, i took care of it
14I used to go to a school in the freaking valley
On blast from the past day last year an annoying kid who sat behind me kept balancing a ruler on my afro T~T
02Not really...
14that the worst part of anywhere to go to school
02LOL AFRO
02AFROBISION
14than new york in the ghetto
02It's evil...as we all know
14you just made it worse >>
I wonder if I still have that afro.... o-o *searches*
the teachers basically TELL you to do that XD, teachers quote: "Solve your own problems with students. I don't have the time i must teach" So, i solved my problem
02:o
*turns around* OH NO IT'S GONE D:
02:O
02X.X
14they teach you things for a reason
it IS though
14you don't waste time time of irritating fools just so you can be an irritating idiot right back at them
/me shrugs "i solve my problems and it works fine :D
14>>
/me shrugs.. I just ignore them ALL
/me goes back to the debate board
If you beat the taturz out of them they wont mess with you anymore.
EXACTLY
/me is 12Testing 4COLOURIES
Therefore stopping a continuous cycle of you getting annoyed
EXACTLY!!!
if they are afraid of you, they wont do it
/me isn't a fighter...
Gir knows what he is talkin about! :D
Neither am I :D
/me isn't meanie...
I get beat up all the time >:3
02almost done, just a few minutes more Gir
im not bullying anyone either, bully's fight you for being "stupid" or for no reason, i have a reason for everything
14and you know what Gir, most all bullies pick on other people continuosly because they're afraid of losing respect and power over one and another
k
14a wonderous cycle, isn't it?
/me is 4GOING TO KNOCK THEM ALL DOWN THE STAIRS!!
then dont be like that
14>>
14nevermind
just beat them up when they bug the taturz out of you over and over
14you boys be boys, no one ever listens to advice nowadays
I'm a pacifist, but I have supreme anger issues
02Girls be girls... never thinking about what the boys think correctly...
/me hides
14HML, stfu
14seriously
exactly, i dont care for "power" or "respect" i dont ever have em in school anyway, i learned that from my years from school >.> so i changed to work with my mind, it works fine how i do it now
14getting into fights ruins your chance of being IN school
DONE :D
14yay :D
THATS WHY YOU DONT FIGHT XD
My excuse would be 'The teachers said to take care of it myself, so I did.'
/me stuffs a large item into his mouth
/me sighs
14you guys are hopeless if you think that way
No, i merely dumped a bottle of whiteout on his jeans
/me doesn't think that way
I'm not trying to start an arguement, I'm just saying, that would be my excue. o. o
14which is highly RUDE
and thats EXACTLY what the teachers tell you XD
excuse*
How would that be rude? xD
i care why? im tired on, i took it into my own hands
02You know what's ruder?
tired of being picked on*
farting
oh
in tired on... xD
14well you know what, think about it, I come from a place where ALL THE SCHOOLS have fights, disrespectful students, gangs, grafitti, "pranks" and murders every so couple of years
02Nope, being constantly push around the stair case by Girls...!
im*
14just think about it :>
lol I just put my hairclip on Polo (dog)
02hey gir, Feather? are you gonna wait me?
Sure
:D
14lol Feath
I have to wait
02:D
cause
14take a picture
02You should give it a carrot
02Carrots are HORRI- Good
my mom wont tell me where the 8-digit number I am searching for is
ok? and i do what i gotta do, and nothing more

02and hi Gir
Finally back online D:
That's what happens when I mess with the router. :D
02what happen'd?
02lol
02is your Wi-Fi finnaly fixed?
Just checked.
Nope. x.x
02X_x
My mom's friend accessed the wireless last night and, me knowing instantly because I got cut off wi-fi, changed the security settings.
the password works but it still wont let me on.
Atleast, that's my moms theory as to why it wont connect.
If you ask me, the little internet symbol on the router not being lit up might have something to do with it.
anyway, imma bounce, so peace everybody
bai

Muwahahahaha
/me sits
12at least you aren't like some people i know
12who throw temper tantrums when i don't change the script so they are always the owner
02:o
02Oh him...
12i really wish i can ban him
02Ask somebody like...
12i can do it myself
12it's just that given the situation it would be a misuse of my power
03ban who? o.o
12kipi
02KIPI
03why?
02Or kick
03what did he do o.o
12he's a childish selfish spoiled brat
02He's annoying Umbreon
12drf
02and that
12he literally threw a fit at me because i wouldn't change my ownership script
12so that he's always the owner
03o_O
03LOL fail
02Yeah...
03not sure why he likes those so much
12months before drf
02I know, almost everytime
12he also got a fit at me because i wouldn't voice him here
02FAIL

12he's a pest that should be banned
/me never complians about being voiced...
03he seems fine in here, dunno about in private o.o
02o.o
o.o
12i understand that drf, which is why i'm a bit irritated
rule number 7 o-o
12i can't prove my case he should be banned
- 7. Respect other people's wishes. If they want you to leave them alone, please le
- ave them alone.
02Oh, #7...
Log it? o.e
12he's not breaking any rules
So he isn't bothering you?
._ .
02Moddel Dellima...
12he's not bothering me
12just being a spoiled rotten brat
and that bothers you.. xD
12even then, it still isn't enough to ban him
12it's my word against everyone elses
02But what about kicking him?
everyone else likes him? ._ .
12also a misuse
12i like being known as someone who doesn't abuse their power
If everyone else likes that person I wouldn't be...wherever this is taking place ;x
02Abuse is use with a +Ab

12meow
02Hi
12sorry
03since when is Umbreon a cat
12i mean your nick
02Since yesterday?
02HSX
02HML
02Very alike
12it shames me to say it but i really don't think umbreon is canine or feline
12but an odd mix of the two
02:o
03XD
12lol
02LOL
12it has both feline and canine features
12so it would just be easier to say its a combination of both
It's a programed piece of coding
12oh
12?
12and literature is just words on a piece of paper
02Good one TG
12lol
02D
It exists because it's developers needed a sprite for said character
12if i remember right
12the anime came before the game
02Say What?
12the animated series came before the video games
12meaning that it's a drawing first, and a programmed sprite 2nd
02Interesting
12i could be wrong though
12i have no way to prove it
02Use the power of Wikipedia!
Or bulbapedia.
02Either will do
02well, night everyone

12basically you have 4 chefs in a 3 round course
12premeal, meal, and dessert
12they are given odd ingredients that don't usually go together and are forced to cook a meal that involves all those ingredients
12judges taste the meal and pick one cook to be taken out, then the other chefs go onto the next round
lol readysteadycook
12this one guy cut his finger open
12and instead of stopping the food to tend to the wounds he digs back into the food and starts rolling his mixture into a ball while blood was dripping into the dish

10o.o
10o.o
Wow that's fail
6o.o
All I said was DCC Send
:P
12o-o
it was an old spamfilter placed to protect peoples connections being killed
there is another variation of it which results in a gline
/me 6missed this
/me rawrs to Reshiram
Even so, how does just simply saying "DCC Send" get you killed
6forgot the name lol
12you want to protect peoples connections from being killed but then you have !pipe
well, that gets you killed because there is a spamfilter telling the server to kill you ;p
Pfff XD
12lol
Umbreon, apply some logic ;p
/me goes back to working on his bot
12i do
12it's 1AM almost
!umbreon
6:50am here :D
well then, !pipe does not let you kill other people, only yourself
[!umbreon vars reset]
D:
no one cares if you do that ;p
12okay okay
12can't you take a joke?
Whut
/me hides
I have trouble figuring out what from you is humour, and whats an actual question ;p
Who? Me?
/me hopes Lyon gets on soon, tired Lugia
lol
LOGIC!
if no one here has old sucky router gear, I can remove the simple dcc spamfilter variant
I don't
I has NetGear routers so :3
I'll not test in here because you lot would likely start pasting back and forth ;p

you ay be disconnected for a bit if it works ;p

12my cat scratched me D:
12pretty good
he/she demands more attention!
12he scratched me
12because i was giving him attention
... okay, then he probably doesn't want it xD
12lol
12anyway it's a shame Espeon
12i thought it'd be more fun if we had matching Avatars on TST XD
xD
12Umbreon and Espeon have to stick together afterall lol
12darnit
12this dusty guitar is making my cat scratch sting
That is true. And I'm sure we can find something that matches, also o.O
12lol

D:
12lol
127 hour time zone difference hurts sometimes

02Hi Kreidt
Hello peoples
Hyper: What lang are you programming in?
02Overly Basic C++
02And it's purpose is to...
Speaking of programming, I'm going to do some programming now.
02EPIC BGM IS FREAKING EPIC </random>
02I'm mauling my .txt Reader into a *IT*
02I've finsihed the first one, but I'm wondering if I should make another one...
C++ is slightly weird.
Too many brackets and semicolons to take care of. It's rather complicated.
Hyper: Okay... now remake that exact same program... in assembler.
02It is fussy about the caps, and case of the Variables
It is, and assembler...no way.
02And those darn bracets
Ruby script is more annoying :P
02I'm only going to compile it into a .exe
Fortran is also something I'd rather stay away from.
Ruby script isn't that good.
The one problem with C and C++. Yeah... compilers usually have a modicum of "SIEG HEIL!" when writing the code. :P
I classify it as a "Python clone".
02XD
Python is good, though.
03physics exam time...
Fortran is easy actually.
03Wish me luck everyone
Good luck drf
Good luck, drf.
02"Good Luck!:

printf('Good luck drf!');
WRITE(*,*) 'GOOD LUCK, DRF'

Amphenol connectors always cost a lot. How much is the one you're looking at?

They're just massive ports for cables
02O3o?
Also, I am looking for two specific plugs actually.
03Damn it
(Which I need just two... each costs $15.80. *grumble*)

That's a reasonable price for an Amphenol connector, you know.
(A 14-S9P and a 14-S1P.)
Although it really depends on the size
Ah
The main reason I need them: I own an... ancient dissovled oxygen meter. And no stirrer or way of interfacing it's "data" port to a PC.
Now... I can get a stirrer made easily... I just need a plug (14-S1P). And the data out is essentially a DAC connected to a serial port (i.e. I have the parts for it... save the connector (14-S9P)).
And you, Skylands.
Ah, I know what you mean...good luck with it, then.
Oh... and also I forgot I need a third, which is a 38999 connector.
(Which is - for some reason that eludes me - the plug for a "ruggedized" wi-fi router.)

14way harsh than being a vegetarian
02I have a vegtarian friend
sssh
02She's not too whiney about what she eats
02And every lunchtime, we ask her if she wants a meat related product
14how old is she?
0214
6tbh
14how long has she been vegetarian?
6I think vegetarianism is stupid
02All her life
6unless you naturally can't eat meat
02One of her parents is a VEGAN
02Or both are vegatarians...
10I agree Aurora

14but people just got problems
14with nearly everything
It depends on why you're a vegetarian, really o3o
6we are natural omnivores, so it's technically going against nature to NOT eat meat
02:o
Aurora, Anita made that point
i would like to but i have to clean and shower and do hwk
/me lols

14it does go against our nature, yeah
I know
12Roara
6although
but she gets all rant-y and scary at times eAe
6I do have this to say about those who think slaughtering is cruel
14but it's cruel to hang a pig upside down and suddenly slash its stomach wide open and let it bleed out
6HOW ELSE DO YOU GET THE MEAT LOL
and supports PETA
12as long as *I* don't have to do the hunting, I'm ok with eating meat~
/me flees
14that's cruel
03same LOL
14we should just kill them naturally or something
02I also ask her, if you're a vegetaian what's the point of canine teeth?
Aurora
03Reminds me of that one funny comment I saw on failbook
you can...
14instead of playing sadistic with it
eat it while it's alive
6for those who drag death out though by bleeding them, fine, that's wrog
just make it worse
/me shot
6wrong
02XD

Stupid home internet has cut out again
02o.o
04:|
And the laptop just overheated -v-
and lolol
people need to figure out how to properly design laptop cooling
The fan on that laptop doesn't work
and in a few cases figure out whether it's actually necessary. In EeePCs it makes 6 degrees difference when far below overheat temp and uses extra battery to be run, totally unnecessary
Anyway i have phone IRC so cya tomorrow maybe

07that sounds boring o.o
I think it's interesting. 'w' The professor is funny 'n' quirky too, so that helps.
/me murrs o.o
Besides the art, we also go over how religion had an impact on the art at the time
/me blush
02yeah Good Class + Good Profesor = GREAT!
Like during the Protestant Reformation, "Greenwood" made an altarpiece specifically to annoy the protestants because they were calling Catholics idol-worshippers. He drew God dressed as the Pope, Mary as a Queen
No need to blush, it's a natural reaction ;)
x3
12it is?
The murr part~
02LOL
It's a really good painting too
12oh
Look up "Ghent Altarpiece" owo

That right there is a triptych though so it can open and close in on itself. When it closes, the people who commissioned it can be seeing kneeling before statues- which again, was meant to annoy the Protestants.
02i try'd at least :3
Oh, that's another sort of interesting thing about art done in the Renaissance. XD 99% of the time, when someone commissions a picture to be donated to the church, said donners are usually put into the picture and they're usually shown at the Crucifixion.

02That is it..
Lawl
02When A Nintendo Console has Sega games
...
02And they will not be judged by the quality of the rendering, but the quailty of the games themselfs...
Gamecube- Sonic Adventures DX and Battle 2
02That was *HIS* dream...
/me runs
Wii- SatSR, SatBK, Unleashed, Colors, 4
02DREAMCAST + Original SA2 = EPIC FREAKING WIN!
Yes
02NAH SA2B is bettah
VMU editor ftw
/me flees
02It has moar Polygons, and is better for multiplayer!
Lol
Polygons don't matter
Look at Brawl
02But that's NOT a port!
Its polygons are less than Sonic Unleashed
02I'm comparing one version to another
But its graphics are amazing
So polygon count doesn't matter
Unless it's horribly low
Then you got a problem :P
02Well it's still better on the Gamecube
Whatever

02Random Worthless remake (for the ones who played the original) is worthless
02Well, I never owned the Orgional, but after playing through BOTH versions of SA2 (SA2B Disk, SA2 ISO), I still think the GC is better in it's own ways... End of Discussion Round
02OBJECTION!
02-Please post your final comments and change-
Ray
02ugh well, i give up to try to defend a classic game
What about the fact the Dreamcast is discontinued?
And has no support anymore?
02yeah, that makes the game even better
02that's the bad
...not really
02thingy
02but find one of those games in this time
If they didn't make the GC versions
They'd have to buy off of e-bay
02I wont be cheap (for colletionists)
02Barely anybody would have it
And that's not really fair :|
Exactly
02Without Pirating
HML is right on this one
02well, he got that one
02but, lets remenber that old times, where THAT was inovating... making a remake just destroys the magic of the original game
02Well.. Super Mario All Stars is still a exception
02It has all 4 Mario NES games on 1 cartridge
02All having significant (at the time) upgrades all around
02SNES?*
02*NES
02The All Stars Collection for SNES...?
02oh rly, i thinked that was for th-----WAIT that was for SNES...
02Yeah, I got it in my Suitcase of SNESTUFFS
02But the battery is failing on me
02:(
02But anyway, there IS HOPE of a SA3 game...
02Could it be... Colours...?
02HECK NO!
...
SA3
I would like that
But eh
02I doubt that they'll ever make another SA game, and I hope they don't
Actually
Unleashed was supposed to be SA3
Aka Sonic World Adventre
*Adventure
:P
02sadly, most of the people now, think that the only thing that CAN save sonic, is that game
02And sonic 4...
02AND sonic 4 your right HML
02Comparsion - Windows 7 is Colours While Unleased is like Vista
02TOTALY AGREE WITH THAT!
La
*Lawl
Yeah
That's actually true
Sonic Unleashed was a beta that was alright but iffy
Colors is improving on that engine

02Crabckaes
02ooook. it's a bit hard to ignore since my sister husband is named like that
o.o
/me returns laughing uncontrollably - "Most. Epic. Boss music. Ever!"
I'm on 113 channels, across 18 networks. I have 11 olines, 24 owners, 43 admins, 56 ops, 4 halfops, and 20 voices. I have abusive power over 407 people.
02What was the song?
02xD
Well, I'll set up the thing first. I was finishing yet another mod for Deus Ex. Which - prior to the final boss - has an elevator ride where you get to see a nice skyline of future Tokyo.
02LOL
And well the music in the cinematic started and I went: "Hey I've heard this before..."
02And..?
And then I realized: "Holy <bleep> it's the theme from the Rocky movies! EPIC!"
02EPIC WIN FTW
/me wants that playing every time he walks home
Unfortunately, the final boss was /not/ as epic as the soundtrack suggested.
/me plays a collection of random videos made by him
02That's a letdown...
02But you did beat the game!
Yay mechanics \o/
"This is gonna be sweet. There's gonna be a giant robot. Or several giant robots. And people with machine guns and all that awesome stuff." *bing* "Let's see the aweso-- dude. It's a dude with a pistol. Oh wait, he probably has uber health, let's go!" *thump* *rocket goes whoosh* *BLAM* "...or not. EPIC FAIL!"
02Wow, it is almost 1am...
02FAIL BOSS
02The teased you throught the game..!
02Just like that evil cake in Portal...
Hi
Not really. This mod was strange. "Ooh, what's this mission, cool we're in Russia we're... invading a commune of hippies?"
02:3
(At least that part was hilarious.)
(As it absued the "drug" effects of the game. :P )
02XD
*runs into a hazy room* "IT'S TIME TO KICK-- Dude... like... crunchy music dude... DUDE! My hands are HUGE!" :P
/me found BROCOLLI in his drink...!
02It's the Non-Deadly Neurotoxin!
Then there was the mission involving blowing up a brewery.
02Did you steal some drinks?
/me plays Terra's story on Critical Mode @-@
Yes. One of the things you can get in the base game is lots of beer, whiskey, and wine. I ended up filling my inventory with beer. :P (Which happens to restore player health so awesome.)
(Only problem... if you drink all thirty you can carry at a time. Welcome to drunk for five minutes. :P )
02I was going to ask that :p
finally
-_-
/me plays BBS
/me now has a Tounge Hudralics problem!

To explain how Deus Ex handles imbibing health restoring alcoholic beverages: "I'm sotally tober!" *blam* "Boo... I'm wit the hall!" :P
02Ell eing unk isss not eh bst wa to in eh ame :p!
/me wonders why is tounge is interfearing with his speach modules...
12o.o

02his upose o apen
My cat loves chasing the laser sight on it. \o/
/me goes and fetches his "Repair Kit"
/me is taking his friend paintballing for the first time
FINALLY he decides he wants to come with me
02o-o
Seriously. My first time paintballing, I tried to be accurate and not use up a lot.
I sucked.
/me sics some 23rd century Starfleet engineers on Hyper - "Go my minions... repair! Or you go on security duty."
Then, I decided to go Rambo, and I got 2 people out the first round.
I'll give him my own advice: DAMMIT, you've only got 500 paintballs to last the whole 8 hours, STOP SHOOTING
8 hours? D:
/me takes his shiny and slippery head out of the bucket
Haha
I was there for probably an hour and a half.
How long did you play for?
How much did that cost you?
/me shrugs.
Dad paid.
What could possibly last 8 hours? D:
02Re u in el me?
Search and Destroy with..50 people? D:
Dozens of games
Ah.
Field's open from 10am to 6pm, I'm there the whole day every weekend
But yeah, first time, I tried to be as accurate as possible.
02:p
I took aim (I had one of the guns that actually had a sight), and fired once.
Hit nobody.
Here's a tip: get closer
But then we moved to the inflatable course.
/me bangs his jaw against a wall
My favorite.
12why do i get a bad feeling about this?
I would hide behind the very first one, and peek out the sides.
02Hmmm?
02hut ould e o ad?
If I saw someone, it was firefirefirefirefirefirefirefirefireohsnapthey'realreadyout.
12what are you saying
/me continues hitting the wall
12please use english -.-
02-What could be so bad?-
Haha
I was just glad I had a few re-filling tubes strapped around my waist.
Pods?
'Coz my hopper ran out.
/me shrugs.
Dunno the term.
I just had a fanny-pack-like thing that held four tubes full of paintballs.
That's what I use
I run out, I pull one of them out, pop the lids, pour them in, and fire again.
Basically it means I'm always trying to get closer or around them to get a better shot.
...10? D:
15 at the most
[10:39] <%Aurora> I kick/kill for the enjoyment
02Wb Lyon
04ty
I usually end up getting two or three eliminations per game
02- I need some assistance, my jaw and tounge has become stuck-
We actually played 'president' once; a game where one person was the president, and the others had to cover him and get him to the other side without him dying. A game involving a lot of running, which makes me sick.
Guess who was the president.
But that's playing 5ish people on each team in an urban field
Haha
We sometimes do games like that
12wheee wild Drake is back, wb
04ty
But, the other way aroun
d
My dad stuck with me, and I was sick halfway across the field.
One person's the hostage
12how goes
He starts with the terrorist team
/me hits his head against the wall so hard, that it falls off!
And he has to escape
If he's shot, terrorists win
The terrorists have to get to the other side of the field with him
CTs have to touch him to win
Oh, boy. XD
/me has always wanted to do paintball D:
Wait
That's a fun game to watch
But anyway, my hopper actually fell out while I was running.
Haha, tighten your feedneck :P
Why not shoot the hostage straight away?
02At least I can talk properly now!
:o
:o
/me confused
It's to stop the CTs from shooting the hostage
Oh
02But I seem to have a disconnection
So, whoever shoots the hostage, the other team wins?
Wait, never mind, it was actually a tie game
oh
Usually someone would grab the hostage and use him as a human shield
If he gets shot, the hostage would make a run for it
Then every single terrorist would start shooting at him
02So, if you could kindly climb up me (and not get imapaled) and reattach my head?
My dad gave me his gun and ran out to get it, and we actually ended up winning. I was about to throw up by the time I got to the other side of the field.
The other team
Erm.
The other team's president hadn't moved.
That sucks.
I'm constantly running when I play, I need to be :P
Drake; and I need help
04?
I mean like, dead sprint the entire time I'm not shooting at someone.
12i'm lost in dawn of the dragon D:

02I did!
:O
I have L4D1, to answer your question.
Nuuuu
I don't Dx
Not Curly!
Dx
I just got it when it was on sale for $6.80
I have L4D1!
We should play some time!
:O
Was gonna get L4D2.... but :/
Buuuuut?
D:
/me points to his country
Mhm.
I still think they're going to end up releasing all of the L4D campaigns on L4D2
Oh
Australia?
Mmmhmmm
D:
/me drags where to the US.
D:
:D
you should have payed someone to gift you from somewhere else :O
But yeah. We should play L4D1 some time. :3
I was thinking of that
I was going to buy an extra copy. >.>;
But does it work?
yes
:/
and if you gift someone you give them the censored version too
Nasty.
so it works both ways
Horrible, horrible present.
Which works for some people
probably not
But it wouldn't go through D:
because your account says your location :P
when you sign up.
It apparently only checks the country/city/state/postcode bit when you buy a game
Apparently works, but not for me.

Halo: Reach is dreadful
Halo 3 was the last 'good' one
ODST was kinda meh
Though I love the magnum on ODST
03it looks like an interactive movie to me LOL
It has a scope XD

XD
o.o
03bedtime
04blah
04I want to play that Mausoleum fight in Halo 2 again :<
04it was epic
04but it takes so long to get too and it's too quick
lol
I would play it, but my Halo 2 disc is damaged :<
04:<
04that SUCKS
Yeah, it's the limited edition disc too :(
04D:
04me and a friend were playing on Heroic last night
04needless to say
04it took a while to kill those damn Hunters
Funnily enough Hunters are easy to kill if your accuracy is perfect
04I just walked up behind those Ultras, like I always do, and whack them in the back before hitting them with a Fuel Rod shot
04yeah, I don't have perfect accuracy
They have an open spot on there necks
04ah
04oh, and I saw the Honour Guard Councillor for the first time last night
lol Honour Guards
04Honour Guards are pushovers tbh
One's with Swords on Legendary are a pain in the ass
They don't know how to die >>
04lol
04btw, is it even possible to kill Regret without boarding his floating chair and meleeing him?
I pummeled one with 4 Beam Rifle shots to the head, still lived :<
Yes
Takes a lot of ammo though
04I tried to do it without boarding, because it makes it too easy, and I could NOT kill him
04:\
04Normal difficulty as well
Preferably dual wielding Needlers work best
8 clips of needlers should do the trick
if you're playing legendary though, you HAVE to board kill him
04that sucks
Tartarus is worse
04it'd be a nice challenge to kill him without that on Legen-
04FFFFF
04don't get me STARTED on him
You have to take his shield off yourself on Legendary
That's a b*tch
04so I've heard
especially when you can't find decent plasma weapons
I suggest Dual Brute Plasma for the shield, then a sword for the kill
04yeah
04two lunges to his back kills him
Not on legendary anyway
04if you get 3 shots to his head in a row with the Beam rifle works
04I saw it work, and not by Johnson
Johnson doesn't help at all on Legendary :<
04I know
In fact only a Co-op player can be of any use
Tis rather annoying doing all the work alone though XD
04lol
I did have fun with a Brute Shot and a Shotgun though
04Brute Shpt <3
04Shot*
04epic melee
Shotgun had 7 shells left
Brute Shot had 1
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Bring it tartarus 8D
04XD
04me and my friend often both get brute shots, then just go on a melee rampage together against Brutes
04less effective on higher difficulties but it works :3
XD
Plasma Pistol VS Tartarus = PAIN
XD
10o.o
10That's odd

but sex IS healthy
like masturbation
04lol
12how is it healthy?
google it
12no
apparently it allows males to make "new seed" or something
Articuno can't google
and for girls idk
8D
but apparently it's healthy
make new sperms for you to take? :D
04lol
yeah
that
04so it's like
04training you?
12of course, girls get nothing good out of it

Yeah it's just
Common sense

04XD
I remember feeling my bro's dick once
04lolWUT NS?
when I was innocent
How'd that turn out
4lol
it just looked interesting
04'when'
for he's a bastard
04when was that?
when she was 3
after 3 she wasnt innocent
and I didn't even know about sex
xD
04that was like
042 years ago for me
I knew it
04how quickly that has changed
since 10 o3o
it's been two years for me
Xeli corrupted me like
Dude I started doing shit since like
1-2 weeks or months after I joined TST
7
04and how long did it take for you to corrupt me?
o_O
04a couple of months?
Sup
02WB Aurora
07as for the suggestive language you guys
That's because
07even if you dont say it outright
You're a horny cockfucker
07don't
I am
I am indeed
We know
he fucks cocks too?
04apparently
Sure why not
pen0r
and Drake
that was because
I wasn't corrupt myself back then
I was still embarassed about that sort of stuff
04lol
Apparantly
Still though
Bullshitblasphemy
I remember I still used to be scared of the word "fuck"
well
I just didn't like swearing at all
especially the f word
I have come to the mindset
04lol
yes I am
And so are all of you
except I'm not exactly a fucker
I'm probably horny
but I don't fuck
well
but they can'y deny cock was in the Bible
my school doesn't hold sex classes
Which is why I'm indeed happy that NS introduced me to the server
unlike in the US
XD
neither does mine
o3o
well
I learnt sex in 6th grade
the more the merrier
and just asked my parents
19-way 8D

10No wai
03totally a surprise knowing me I'm sure
14it's really really weird
6drf
02Not that Pic..
6how many times you gonna show that?
03...
6I've seen it like 10 times now
03That's my *REAL COMPUTER*
03That's not VMWare
yawai
03it's a different picture
6ah
6well then
6congrats lol
03I have a spare laptop hard drive
03that I thought I'd try to install OSX on
03it works too
03just no Wi-Fi yet. I need to fix that. LOL
14I wish I had Mac software
03EW why?
6why?
14because
02WhY?
03I don't actually want to USE OSX
6don't say it looks good
03I just wanted to install it to prove I'm better than Mac owners
02He did it for teh fanbois
03because my laptop is easily twice as good as a macbook
14I don't think so at all lol
03costs about as much
03so yeah
14I want a Mac for music and art
6drf, better than people who WANT macs, not technically mac owners
03and since I can now run OSX on it
03etc
/me 6runs
03well
03yeah
03but
6may
03my computer is higher powered than yours
03basically
6here's the thing
14?
6most art classes and universities require macs for some stupid reason
10k
03anything you can do on a Mac you can do on Windows...
14because of art
6they use them, mac is everywhere in schools
02Yup...no
03because
6it's kida stupid though
14Macs are highly recommended for it
6because I can do all that on winxp
02Yes it is...
03students are the only ones dumb enough to fall for the RDF
03taht's why
03*that's
/me fangirls over Repede
03therefore Apple pays a crapton of money to universities to endorse their products

02What's wrong with Detroit?
14uhh
14oh wait

/me has seen it
03...
03Detroit is a fricking huge ghetto
14yeah
for I'm just the person for old games
Uh huh
5Eastern parts of where I live are pretty ghetto. The city officials just hide it really well.
14Detroit, also, has a lot of car production industries, right?
lol idk where to get one
So why do you need a virtual box for that
03yeah
14okay yeah
14pretty much everything out on the east shore, especially where New York area is, has a lot of ghetto from the Great Immigration back in the late 1800's/ early 1900's
14even in the northwest area
Yeah, that's it. :D
14no Washington, oh no, not there

Windows XP vista
02I never use WMP, or any audio program to play my music

02-I have NO music to play!-
02Hi Guessert
Before you say it, glac, the match never happened.
And hello
02She's not here
Ah, it is a vista
heh
not an XP
I think you mean he.
well
for an old game, you'd want something like win98
02Woops, presses NOOOO button
or winxp
32bit
02-Not again.. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO-
I have a 63 bit so...yeah
*64

/me already passed 10:10:10 10/10/10
02I did that 2 hrs ago
02Well, kinda
Same happened here approx 2 hours ago.
02It's 12 am over there>
hey Drake
02And to steal my "heart" you would need to tear me to pieces
12not really
02Yes really!
02Oh well, you can't argue with the Unversed
12XD
12yush, we indirectly become Heartless! :O
12and then Nobodies break off somewhere in there too
02You need some love
/me gives LL a huge Plushei

12even as a being created by negative emotions, I am still nonviolent o3o
02How ironic...
12not really
By the way... don't push the button marked "PUSH FOR SUPER HAPPY FUNTIME" or at least don't push it until I'm somewhere on the other side of the planet with a good alibi. :P
02Why did you say that?
/me pokes the White Mushrooms, the Rare Truffles, and now the Unversed who are very similar to the above mentioned
12all nonviolent
02Did you say HAPPY FUNTIME?
12White Mushroom Heartless only want to play Charades
/me presses the button!
12Rare Truffles want to fly
12and the new ones give gifts
02Interesting
/me laughs manicaly as he flies off
/me transports to Brazil before SUPER HAPPY THERMONUCLEAR EXPLOSION FUNTIME happens
/me follows
/me hides in *her* bubble (since Idk if Unversed have genders)
/me hides in his "Time Bubble"

03DESPITE the filter I Made
03>_>
12o-o
03it's almost like they go "zomfg attachments *SPAM*"
03which is usually true, except that when my mom emails me something...
03and like, today, she didn't tell me she was gonna send pix of my dog
03so I didn't know to look in trash, as why would I?
o
03it wasn't until she went "did you get the pictures?" that I was like OH and looked
03it is
Now that works

02o-o
the only good thing i can think of about nikki being all hurt like she is is that she can't kick me. i swear she takee some sort of perverse pleasure from kicking me when i least expect it
/me is back.
02fff
wb
02annoying script
/me growls.
Ari guess what!
and she always gets me at exactly the moment i let my guard down for even a splitsecond
whats up
/me is back.
02.
/me is back.
02stupid script
What Kitten? :o
/me sits quietly.
/me is back.
02wtf
o3o;
02whatever
02afk
I'm pissed off enough that I'm considering going back into total isolation. Great. >.<
nonononononononono
i'm pregnant!
uhwhaa?
Yay, congratulations Kitten!
when did this happen?
and i can't remember how old kitten is
17 :3
/me giggles
nikki says congrats
lol
and i second that sentiment
i'm kidding, i'm not pregnant.. yet
xD
:o
i'm going to have a baby on November 12, 2013
nikki thinks that wasn't funny
Hmm
/me has all kinds of questions
The world'll be over by then, though.
i'm laughing so hard and i'm sooo thankful she can't kick me XD
if she could she'd be kicking me repeatedly
/me wonders why Kitten wants to have a baby on that exact date
because!
randomness?
Hmmm
great now she wants a beer
/me has a guess
i think it'd be cool to have a baby at 9:10am on the date 11-12-13
lol that would be
Ohhhhhhh
so i'm going to try..
thanks Kitten you just helped me dodge a bullet
you distracted her
Kitten: Why not on 11:11:11 11/11/11?
lmao that would be cool too
how'd i do that?
ooooooh, or, 06:07:08 09/10/11
and Ari because! i'd only be 19.. and well 11/11/11 is so cliche
06:07:08 09/10/11 <--- not cliche
i'd only be 18 at that date Ari!
you distracted her with the baby birthdate thing long enough for me to get out of reach of her good arm
Oh
:D
Kitten: How old do you want to be?
mine i'd be 21
i dunno.. but not 18..
okies
/me grabs the shovel of doom
And so we have to find you a boyfriend in time too
/me digs a hole and buries things in it
:P
Things! Perfect!
Things: Would you like to be a father?
:o
Things: Just do everything Kitten tells you to do
Erm, probably not quite yet :3
oi! i just planted him
/me turns bright red
Too late, we already formed a committee
i;'m waiting to see if he grows into a burrito tree
no not yet Things.. i'm waiting atleast 2 years..
/me fluffles Kitten
Perfect, okay then, it's settled :3
Kitten: What are you going to name him/her? :o
decide where i'm planting you
/me thinks Kitten is really good at naming :3
i'm going for a spaghetti taco tree this time
I want to be a candy tree :3
nope! i want a spaghtetti taco tree
ooooooooh, pretty :3
/me likes Miyuki Sun
nice names ^_^
thank you!
lotsa fertilizer there for growing a good spaghetti taco tree
If it's a boy, you should name him Mark Antony or Prometheus
imma brb getting nikki munchies b4 she eats all of mine
kk
Prometheus is a cool name
nooooo
Prometheus was the guy who stole fire from the gods and gave it to the humans :3
That's like the most gutsy thing you could do :3
And he failed and got caught.
Lame.
no the most gutsy thing you could do is steal something from chuck norriss
*norris
..... Mark Antony almost re-conquered the Roman Republic during its transition into the Roman Empire?
nikki corrected me -_-
....... Octavian beat Antony though
Almost!
Still fail.
Sure.
chuck norris defeats all
I'm too sleep deprived to know who I'm bashing.
crap she jacked my coke ;-;
another new user?
I always pictured Octavian as kind of a nerdy guy though
i think if its a boy i'll name him Akira Kain or Nailo James
or not lol
cool names too :)
/me bumps tatu
Kitten: Nice names :)
I think Kitten would be a good mother
i second that
Alright, the motion is on the table
/me blushes
oh Ari! did i tell you i proposed to someone the other day?
nikki wanted to vote until i pointed out she doesn't know Kitten
cool :)
hey there
Hai! :D
Kitten: ooooooo, nope!
yep!
/me hugtackles LightLie! <3
Cool!
/me huggles
no she's busy trying to steal my pickle before i eat it even tho she has 3 of her own
:S
hmm
lol i think she MY munchies and hers
is she preggers?
that got a wicked smile. my stomach is doomed :/
nope
you know you should get her ice cream
/me nudges them together
just recovering from her ex bf beating her up and throwing her down a flight of stairs
get her ice cream then
she already ate it all
get her more.
last night
Well get her some more!
i'm out
/me high-fives Kitten
buy some!
/me giggles
and she ate my entire cake i made earlier. i didn't even get a crumb ;-;
so?! she's hurt
i think i made the mistake of promising to share it
eatting makes ppl feel better when they're hurting
so go get her ice cream or i'll kick you too
and i'll use my lovely new steal toed boots
/me smiles
lol she's content with my pickles. i gave in and just gave them to her, she was gonna end up with them anyways
ice cream is better
lol
she's shaking her head
ohhh! get her mint chocolate chip ice cream and pretzels..
pickles are her favorite food
they compliment eachother very well
then by her pickle ice cream
they make that?!?!?!?!?!
and yes, they make that
:o
/me has never come across it
i've had fish flavored ice cream before tho
i didn't like it so i gave it to nikki and she went back for 4 more helpings
eeeew
there's a ice cream shop.. can't remember the name of it for the life of me atm though, thats in chicago that cells pickle ice cream
sells*
she devours that stuff every chance she gets lol
hahaha i'm emperor of the pickles
i gots the jar
let's see how long that lasts tho
she just jacked my beer ;-;
she's even worse than me today when it comes to being a human garbage disposal
she's eating her food and anyone else's she can get her hands on
and she weighs 50 pounds less than me
i take that back. 45 pounds less than me
lmao distraction isn't effective on just small children, it works quite well on nikki too
i got her attention with a bag of peppermint sticks
she's busy with that, so maybe i can finally eat a pickle without it being snatched before my second bite
she wants another cig now, even tho i just carried her out for one not that long ago
-_-
/me is bored
same
but
I need sleep
03so do I but w/e
bbiaf i'm taking her out to smoke before she comes up with some new way to get my munchies

/me nuzzles Ari
12i felt sick at league
12and my legs felt so weak i could barely go down the stairs
Bai, Stew.
ok we're back and she's gloating over her prize, i gave up on eating pickles and just gave her the whole jar
she'll eat them 'till she makes herself sick off them and there'll be a couple left for me to eat while she's busy feeling miserable from eating most of the jar
:D
/me tosses Kitten a fresh warm cookie
:)
hmm chat is dead here
:P
only kass and me
yea basically
nikki's busy laying on the other end of the futon feeling sorry for herself
:X
i told her not to eat so many lol
she never listens when pickles are involved
that you did

I had to leave for History class :3
She's reaaaaaaaaaaally cute though >.>
Like, intimidatingly cute >.>
/me wishes he was able to have conversations with people he doesn't know
:O OMG!!!!!!
yes? :o
/me wishes the same :(
I would be like "So... um.... .... what do you think of internet neutrality?"
LoL
Of course, she could say "OMG!! Internet service providers should NOT interfere with the freedom of the internet!!!!!!!!"
And I will know I have found my soul mate :3
:3
:)
What is this fascination about talking to people one does not know? D:
You can't just pick them up and carry them away most of the time
Really? o.o
They have looked quite happy afterwards D:
Yeah, they usually don't like that in the U.S.
/me is obviously just being silly though and just usually has crushes on people that just hate him and such ^^
hehe
/me nods
/me is scared most of the times talking to girls that he don't know.! But know that my friends said COMM'ON man you are in university OK ? just do whatever you want
But still i kinda freeze when she come in front of me..!
All the times i wanted to say just a Hi to her... but couldn't make even that
:(
I don't freeze, I really don't care what people think of me, but I just don't know what to talk about
:3
'w';;
I can talk like a talking machine as long as I am talked to first :p
I'd just lean in and start kissing her if I didn't think she'd be offended
I can't find the teacher's blog site.
/me is a good listener but not a good spontaneous talker
I even have to imagine a conversation and know what I'm about to say before I talk to someone
:3
07aaaaaaa
07How are you?
Just buy one from Russia.
Uhmm
Good in most ways
Can't find the blog site where my teacher posts homework though
XP
Or Pakistan
Scarryy...1!!
what if i say something.. and she doesn't like it :O
I am who I am and if the girl doesn't like then she prolly isn't for me :3
:3
07Ugh
07Sounds annoying
Yeah, but first you have to win her.! and then....
you know...
Indubitably.
:D

Claim her, rawr!
This is what my friend said to me..
/me swings around his battle axe!
:D

Or from other countries?
.-.
There is no need to be so discriminative about girls, there are hawt gals everywhere \o/
/me rolls around like a silly.
Pakistan == exotic from my point of view
:3
/me has to search this word EXOTIC in detail.
/me appoligizes for his weak vocabulary :(
It's okay
I might've misspelled it
The spelling is right but is this a bad word
?
no
mhm
Exotic = alien: being or from or characteristic of another place or part of the world; "alien customs"; "exotic plants in a greenhouse"; "exotic cuisine"
It means foreign, different, but exciting -- it's always used in a good way
Oh!
Hehe
/me loves girls who are exotic and unique :3
And stuff :3
:D
Well, its something in our veins, you know..! Guyz love Girls ;) :P

12but things seem slim for her
12well she's already lost a match
12and one of her opponent's hasn't won a match yet
hm
12?
12for the brawl tournament
I see kind of "hm" :P
12i'm sure you haven't seeen a tournament run like this that often though
12so you probably are at least a little bit confued
12*confused
I haven't, I dunno what system you use but it looks more fun than STRIKE, YOU'RE OUT
Welcome back, Stewery!
12basically
12even though roara lost a match
12she is still capable of winning the whole tournament
I see
12all she has to do is make 2nd place after 4th round
12but to get 2nd place easier she needs to get good resistence
Thanks :3
12basically the better her opponents do the stronger her resistence is
Okay o.o
12basically right now her resistence is 66.5%
^_^
:O
12it's hard to explain
xD but it seems to work

12i'm not a mod anymore
oh

RaptorJesusfloof
We gave everyone this oxygen stuff
So they could breath underwater
Then we went to a sunken city
Since, ya know, if you're underwater you don't get pain from a wave
:P
How long do we all last untill we die of pressure?
12hmm
Well
The wave came at 10:01 or somethig
or lack of oxygen
It was LOUD
And everyone kinda flew up and down as the waves came
I almost got completely out of the surface xD
wouldnt we..
drown instead?
When we realized that we needed to hold onto something we held hands
since I dont personally know anyone who can fully break from the pressure and strenght of the waves
and manage to break out
After 4 or 3 more waves the flood stopped
lol holding hands can stop anything o3o
except nuclear holocausts
True xD
But yeah
That's wat happened
i was heroah

apperently only cockroaches holding hands can survive that

yes use large disk support, and hmm
er how?
and to your question
idk
:/
i've never used the program
but i will say this
if you running the program from vpc
the game needs to be running from vpc as well
I'm running cheat engine on my computer, and the game on VPC
you can't run the game from the host OS, and expect the emulated PC to see it
vpc being the virtual box
that won't do
:/
the cheat engine needs to be on VPC
with the game
ok
yes enable it

7if you were twenty six, no doubt you would be a mere child compared to our brilliance
WELL UR A STUPID IDIOT WHO DOESNT HAVE A LIFE!
SO FUCK YOU
7go, cry about your shame
07Espeon
07its so silly
07one of the differences between chat and rl
07is the degree
07of
07affection LOL
07sure I'm getting used to you but XP
12I do have a life, and a girlfriend, and friends, and a dog named Buddy.
the day internet based chat can offer that sort of thing, that's the day "social life" becomes an ancient term
and I know what you mean
12Ah Buddy, I love that dog.
7I have no life, but I like it that way
7I'm a rather asocial person
07I dont want social life to ever become ancient.
12True, when you have no life, you have no worries.
07but yeah o3o
07I mean
07I dunno, I hold onto everyone but I'm seriously afraid of holding onto you for support .-.
07See
07when we're walking somewhere
07I ALWAYS
07worry
MY SIS IS GETTING ON BYE
07'don't walk into Espeon, just DON'T walk into Espeon'
07like
07constantly
07silly disability
12Not as fun as others, but I'll take it.
aww x3
You seem to do well at that though :P
Hiii
07then again I'm a bit nervous to ask if I can hold onto your arm ^^; I do with most of my friends here but its just you
07Espeon I try really hard but
/me glomps
07It's challenging and very tiring
07after we've been out for a few hours I'm always exhausted
:>
i dont think anyone is here
/me happeh kitteh
o.o; no need to be nervous ^^
07You sure..?
12Hey.
07I just dont want to intrude on your personal space
um hi...
Yes?
12Nothing dear...
holding onto my arm isn't intruding my personal space :P
-_- dont call me "dear"...
I mean, if it was just the first time we met like *GRAB* then it would be o-O wut but
07lolol
07well okay ^^
07You might've noticed I sometimes lightly brush you or something
07all that
12*touches*
07is just so I can orient myself
*slaps*
07I manage fairly well, but even if you walk on one side, then switch, can be confusing XD
07takes a few for it to register in my mind
12Never said you! D:<
I see, never really thought of it like that though ^^
07Meeps
07I've honestly been afraid of bringing it up
07always hesitated because
07I don't want to come across as silly/clingy/weird LOL
Listen
I'm not even ALLOWED to call people weird because that would make me a hypocrite... in a way
/me dies
07well most people aren't you .-.
07I've gotten some weird responses
07to the disability and holding onto people for support
07MOST people are OK with it
07but
07not everyone
07anyway like
07PEOPLE LOL
I see ^^
07TALK TO ME XD
07meep^^
meow~
/me pokes shadow
whats the product key?
126666666666666666666
o3o
thats lucifer
I dont own him yet
12noooo
12it's drf D:
12hi
LOL
Umbreon: I don't want to.
lol
Umbreon: Check back later and see if I learn the answer to that one.
wait
nvm
03http://dillyeo.com/r-c-desktop-forklift <- LOL wut
12You really know when to show up Dari...
wait...
what would it be?
Yep, perfect timing as always. :P
for I only get 3 boxes
and theres 4
bbsclass
12You should be a time king or some shit like that. o.o
7OR, Thor!
7Thor has great timing
12Holy shit! Dari is Thor?!
7The Asgard, not the god
7the Asgard being an alien race in this context
12Oh I see.
7the egg came first btw
*5 boxes
and the serial key inside the folder, only has 4
12No, two parent are needed to make an egg.
12Unless it's asexual
12guess
7hold on, this is a bitch to describe. I'll c/p my answer from a paradox thread I made
7"evolution provides us with the answer: the creature we consider 'chicken' was obviously hatched out of an egg by its evolutionary ancestor divergant enough to NOT be considered 'chicken.' Therefore, the egg was first."
I concur. Egg first.
12Put where did the egg come from?
Two just-not-chicken-chickens.
7... it says that, in my answer
7read it again
12Oh I see now.
7it came from the chicken's evolutionary ancestor, we'll call them pre-chickens
12From a single-celled organism perhaps....
7OH shit. I forgot my history homework
12Homework is pointless in my school, as long as you write down something, you get credit.
7... I hate you

03really
03all that's wrong with it is I physically broke the plastic tabs off

so, I successfully made some really bad mistakes today at the register |D
02:X
6my supervisor is gonna kick my butt, but it's my 3rd day so...
10D: what happened?
02How many did you make?
6money problems
2D:
6a few of them were me entering the wrong amount (I gave the right amount of change, yay for mental math)
02Oh no, I remeber my first day as a Cashier...
6but my register will show up with the wrong amount when they count it tonight and compare to the computer
2Also, Roara
6the worst one was something I don't even know what happened
02:o
well that was accidental
6but we had to void the payment, redo it, void it again, redo it, my supervisor came at this point and helped, voided it again, redid it, and I think we wound up paying the customer more than she payed us >.>
02Ouch...
02How did it go?
6so yeah, thankfully I'm new at this
6or my supervisor would probably have killed me on the spot
Mew
Hi Roara
03so yeah
03that test
03was pretty impossible
03x.x
wow this chat is dead

Wanna know what's impossible?
These leaderboards
03I got lucky enough to have a fairly smart person sitting in front of me though

03Pokémon Ranger 2 was nowhere near as good as the first
03they over-simplified iot
03*it
Lul

03maybe I'll go pirate it
I liked 2

03I basically distrust everything on that site
02Not really...
What

6well
6this isn't the forum
03Serebii is basically known to have crap info
03like
03their B/W names
03are half wrong
Everything on that site is legit isn't it? o_O
mike's getting me some ramen to go with my pickles
03the translation from Japanese
6I trust the game mechanics pages and the game summaries
And orly
6drf
6they had to change the names
2Whoa
2Kyu is alive
6because of nintendo's warning
03um, what
03no
02CD>>>2>3>1>
7o.o
7Hai again.
HML
03I'm not talking about the pictures
6half of the names were changed because of it
hi ._.

6neither am I
03well then Serebii is just stupid
Why ._. face?
I'm talking about the genesis ones
6pokebeach did it too
pickles and ramen...interesting
03I'd be like "send me a real C&D or I won't "
02That is a Genisis one
No
02Sega CD addon FOR genisis
It's Sega CD
6shanderaa, the correct name for the chandelier, was changed to chandelar
Derp
02Fien then
because my teachers gonna be sad and disappointed at me again :(
/me hugs
Lolz
03regardless, point of my arguement is that the 5th gen Pokémon suck regardless of name
/me runs
.-.
Drf
:o hi :3
Your argument was that Serebii failed
02Stop hatting Gen 5
Which reminds me, I was supposed to re-write an essay....

:|
03but yes

03Feather, you say anything that fails is good
/me rus
03*runs
/me gets the Popcorn
03no but seriously, Serebii sucks
That's because the page editors are lazy
10But it's only your opinion though
03and the fact that they're in association with #PM helps
I mean really
ouch ;-;
10Apple doesn't really suck :D
do you have a lizard? :O
03because #PM is evil and that's not just my opinion
02ORLY
i'm already all hurty ;-;
Does an alligator count?
02!ew Apples and Oranges
03EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW APPLES AND ORANGES

7Ya know, it's hard to draw your fangirl'd characters when you're... well, fangirling over them every few seconds.
XD
ikr?
7X3
02mew :3
asdf
02asdfdsad
7And.... hrm...
7Now that I'm drawing it, it's hard to see my three fan'd characters ever interacting well together. O_o
02O.o
02Then, they should all go!
/me 7needs to stop rambling about her fan'd characters.
02Rambling should only be done by me!
7Okay, back to my train of thought:
7Because two of my fan'd characters are like... mysterious and serious. O_o
7The third is adorkable.
02Then let's make a match!
7One is a villain, one is an antihero, and one is a... not really a villain.
02Teh LOL mix
02AKA. Shadow, Eggman and Charmy Bee...?
02LOL, oppisite atraction?
/me hides
7O_o
02Well that is a decent example
7I don't know those characters all that well, but yes to the Shadow, yes to Charmy Bee, and no, not really an Eggman-like character.
7Perhaps when it comes to calculating...
02Rouge?
/me hides
7No, HML. :|
02www.nooooooooo.com
7I'm not sure if there's a character in Sonic I know that's such a threat as my fan'd character.
02Then your character must be really bad
7Well, he's second to an almighty deity of destruction. :P
7But he's not standard Chaotic Evil.
02Will... Sephiroth do...
/me hides
7Sephiroth... O.o
7Possibly, lawl.
02HE KILLED______-----
7Minus the bishonen aspect.
7Hey, Ryuusei killed Galrick. :P
02But ----____--- was a important character!
7And?
02IT HAD GOOD CGI AT THE TIME!!
02</random>

bye Proto :x
02Woops, I forgot to add </badexample> to it
Except the ship looks like someone basically took the Soverign class... added a few decks to the saucer section... and replaced the sleek streamlined warp nacelles with something that looks like it should be used to move starbases. :P
And it does have extremely powerful phasers... that you can't aim. :P
bye Proto!
Bye!

The blue is more epic
And my Golden Armour :P
Which is King Calians armour (Dragon Age Origins)
03hm

240MSP
125 hour energy makes you insane

125 hour energy doesn't work with me

02!umbreon
03on the shop?
12and i think it makes me sick
03I mean, I don't care about the armor

/me runs

Pfft boring Gnomes XD
02TRAVELOCITY
/me runs
The marketplace...
aaaaw sis left :(
02Time to go!
Does it unlock new items if you buy different games?
bai
O.o
Well
/me gives the Muzzled Latias a pat and leaves
I'm here ^^
You can unlock Avatar items by playing certain games
So I can get a light saber without getting a Star Wars game?
XD
Ah
Duh
Yay
You can get everything in the marketplace without the games
Like the L4D2 avatar items
04:<
if you don't have the game you can still buy the items
Instead of unlocking them ingame
03LOL you can get a lightsaber?
Yep
03aha
03I'm so gonna get a dragon and a lightsaber
03together
/me runs
You can only have one prop
+equipped
03How to train your dragon: Threaten it with a saber
/me RUNS

03wtf a dragon counts as a prop?
Yes
Yeh
Oh yeah
Oricle
As a prop
:3
omg
lol
You're talking about the lightbulb from Halo right? XD
i love acros~
Yep

That thing SUCKS as a prop
My friend has him as a prop
XD
Why
It's small and cuteish
/me flees
Because everyone has it
Ah
I have 4 different props
So it sucks because it's overused? XD
/me nods
and here's the explanation :p
i want a nuke
XD
I used to use it, when I unlocked it
Hm
/me ...
But then I gots my blue dragon :3
/me stifles a yawn
night all
Night LL~
I wonder if SEGA made any props for Xbox Live
Cya
Chao floating around you
|3
Anyway bed soon
But I KNOW for a fact there isn't a Chao
When I dc, that means bed
then i could turn it into a birdbath and all the birdies would fly by and go "oooh a birdbath" and when they land in it they'll be like "what a nice bath. blargh i'm dead"
XD
k
that's the explanation
any questions?
nuke as in nuclear?
mike is sitting here laughing really hard
yeah as in a nuclear bomd
er bomb
Poor birdies! D:

10I hope a design like this wins
hahaha nope
Multiplayer, social slayer playlists
03so where's training?
10unless they mean a whole new dragon
/me nods
he and i have rubbed off on each other ^-^
There isn't training as such
6a whole new design
03...
It's a level system online
03there's no multiplayer setting
03on the menu
03all I see is
when you spend as much time together as we have you rub off on each other
03that's it

03And then what
6but you see fetaher
i'm where he got his crazy side ^-^

6that was drawn for a contest with the same name
Set the Playlist to Social Slayer
6but the contest was advertised along with the "Legend of the Boneknapper Dragon" on CN this thursday
6so
6I dunno lol
03and then how do you get the achievement?
Play until you level up
Should take 1-4 games
03oh
03so why does it say "or complete basic training"?
I dunno
03k
03my friend's too lazy now XD
OH!
WAIT
Basic Training is that beginning thing when you start the campaign crap
03...
03my friend was like, definitely not o.o
03because he beat the whole thing
03on campaign
03and didn't get that achievement
/me is listening to kiss or kiss

03he stood 2" from him
I think she just went to do homework
03with that gun that shoots pink pointy things

Your double needlers wouldn't affect me with a Sword
03and watched him fall in the water

6my dad, my uncle, and I used to have halo wars all the time
or she was creeped out because I'm a cyborg :O
03er yeah that
6the two of them hated me because I ran straight for the needlers
03I totally can't picture Aurora playing Halo
Needlers suck on Halo 3
03my friend likes needlers
6what did they do D:
They don't lock on properly and you can only wield one
Easily avoided
03FFS I wish this canker sore would go away
6...
Some dude online was needling me (or trying to) the last weapon I had was a plasma pistol
I won
6geez halo 2 ftw then
03my friend recommended salt water but...
6double needlers is the only way I play
/me 6runs
03meh I don't really care for Halo in general;
Fail
6no, I was pretty decent with all the weapons
03I prefer Left 4 Dead and whatnot

Aurora you wouldn't stand a chance against me then XD

02you do have talent
04my uncle even wants me to design tatoos for him o-o

04lol
02you are pretty good
02game designer?
04yeah
02not bad
04that's what she called it
02you'd probably do better as an animation artist

04I know
04and I don't mind it at all
04dunno why you thought I'd be upset about that
02except you're probably less of an asshole I am
04tbh I admire you
04lol
02both IRL and on the internet
04only because I don't have the courage to be an asshole

04or rather the blatant disregard
well at the human race is rather complex parser
/me hides

04WHY DO YOU KEEP SPEAKING?
02the "don't care" approach
02it's a script
04I know
04but it's weird
02yah
02anyway
02yeah
02most of what I do is because of my "I don't care" approach
02dunno whether I do things out of courage or whatnot
04surprisingly, I DO care alot about what people think
04just not what my family thinks
02similar to me
02very similar in fact
02just about the same
04we're so made for each other
02Hensh is going to kill me for that
02It's my philosophy discussion board post
02It's very badly structured and argued
02and there's a shitload of flaws
02and probably less time
02but it's what I think
04well
04tbh I don't have much of an opinion on laws other than they suck and are annoying
i suck at level 70 in the flawed masses
04but I'm not great at debating to whoo for me!
04but it's weird
04...
04STOP TALKING
02neither am I
02but hey
02Hensh is still going to kill me
04why?
02it's pretty badly argued
04my existance is badly argued
04do I care

How are you
12unchanged :|
Hmm... I take it that isn't a good thing
12no
12its not
I've fallen into a real rut as well
join #vore
oops
Uh how about no
:|
12O.o
no i was trying to go there
Oh right I see now
/ is important
sure is
Who are you anyways
Anyways ruts suck
12yah
I'm hoping to get some new games to break this rut
I've heard great things about super scribblenauts
12i like it
12sort of
12i'm annoyed how it takes me 60 minutes to complete a puzzle that people on average takes 8 minutes to do
12lol
My mind is exploding with ideas to try first
heh
You should look into it LL great for boredom killing
12o3o
12mebbie
It's cheap, $30
12that's cheap? >_<
Yea :D
/me would rather get Dead Rising 2, tbh o3o
12which is $60 yes
That costs WAY more
Twice
12but it's for the 360, which I need more games for o3o
12plus, I get discounts~
I need more ds games
But also to save for 3DS
12same
12but
/me has like: $500 lol
Oh lucky
You can afford 3DS !
12no
12not lucky
12a hard worker v-v
:P
/me flees
I'm going into eBay selling
And I'm sorry I'm sure you worked very hard for that
02back :3
12lol
12and wb
And for that I commend you
12tys o3o
What color 3DS you getting ?
12Idk, blue?
12?
I'll probably wait for twilight black again
I dunno
I'm not a big fan of solitare games
12Twilight o3o
Ugh not that one
12yush <3
that series can go burn
12lol
12is it really solitare?
12its japanese so it must be good D:
12D:
12and
/me LOLS!
solitare is a game you play by yourself >.>
so.. yes
12I just broke Ven's hold XD
12and am heading to the winner podium
12in my opinion there is no such thing as a true solitare game
12...and rolled a 1 v-v
12because you can always have friends there helping you out with advice
Also I'm now against piracy
then you're cheating
12lolz
12dun let drf hear that o3o
12when in the rules does it say getting advice is cheating?
I intend to buy everything I wish to play
12actually come to think about it, it doesn't say in the rulebooks that cheating isn't allowed either
02NOOOOOOOOO
02PIRACY HERE IS A GOD, just like the companion cube
So Nintendo can get back to real updates
12Companion Cube <3
02here things AAAAAAAAAAARRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEE WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY TOOOOOOOO MUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCH EEEEEEEEEXPENSIVE!
I'm even reporting some of my old rom sites I used to visit
I thought that was a given
12oh blah
Piracy is NOT good
02here a normal ds game with the dollar change, is 150$ us FOR JUST ONE GAME, not worth it >_>
12lol
12I forgot that poem >_<
12if its not in writing you have a good excuse
in that case I can finish any puzzle in 0 seconds... assuming I can start the timer the moment I finish solving the puzzle
12about the Companion Cube
because nobody said its not allowed
12exactly
02>_<
Do we really want Nintendo to keep up with these "updates"
12and nao moar Kingdom Hearts Party~
I for one want real new features
that's stupid logic :|
thats like the guy yesterday
02yeah you are right Kuro, But understand Here IS WAY TO MUCH EXPENSIVE
who yelled at me for not breaking up a fight
because nobody told him not to start one >.>
Starting with a new wii menu
12heh
12i'll try to take any advantage i can get
02well, my wii is hax free, so yeah why not/
02not?
More Mii Options
GB/GBC/GBA VC
>.>
/me is downloading mabi's client atm
12yay
i'm getting on just to amuse myself
12:3
Actual wii demos maybe
not to take it serious
12i know
12who is going to get HTTOD?
12*HTTYD
12there are some Wii Demos
12and as for VCs of handhelds
why do I have to think about what that acronym is every time I see it >.>
12why not make those DSi exclusive
Downloadable demos I mean
12same
02dsiware are exclusive
3DS is getting GB/GBC VC
12really?
02yeah
:)
12good
Yes
02+ NES/SNES
its too long, thats why
02as DLC
^ huh ?
12there's really no need to make old handheld games become Wii VC games
That's not confirmed
12handhelds should stay handhelds
02yeah they 3DS has NES and SNES too
I want a source
02Confirmed also...
12but old home consoles becoming handheld=FTW
Source please
02wait.. let me find something
12like the ROMs
12the acronym reminds me too much of YTMND
my acekard is packed with old games
12same, Kuro
Every NES/SNES title out there
I don't know what that really is either
12some dumb site
What emu you using for NES ?
12me?
12NES DS
Yea
Did they feed Sparx too? :o
I love the rewind feature
With delicious butterflies!
your the man now dog
that's the extent of my knowledge
12XD
12that's win~
mmmm butterflies
Old game roms imo aren't pirating
12i know what it stands for
There time for profit came and went

/me anime'ing
waiting on the slow download of mabi to get done
weird how i can download 8GBs of anime, in an hour but this mabi client says it's going to take 2-3 hours
7I was tempted to comment that his lisp was 'adorable.' Decided to just mention Anonymous
when it's only 1g
o.o
Lol fail. Thinks he's clever. "I CAN HAZ IP ADDRESS"
a) Proxy b) No exact locations. Idiot.
12bad server
7His uncle works for the FCC. He can 'type in our IP' and get 'all our information'
Make this a reality Nintendo please !
heh
Hahaha, good luck to him.
Those were just tech demos
7and, apparently, they have connections with the NSA, the FBI and such. none of them have any jurisdiction outside of the USA, right?
02yeah, but there is HIGH probably of those becoming real games, like all other ones
7heh
12eesh
OMG Super Mario World 3D :D
02Maybe just as DLC, but still, classics making come back
12the fact that Nintendo seems to be gambling all of this on a handheld says something
02SMW + 3D > Chuck Norris
Lol, talking about getting other people's information, his yt acc is a name and he just posted his face all ove he internet.
xD don't let chuck hear you say that
7Yeah. 4chan will crush him before he can even decide which shade of pink to do his site.
just a sec
LOL
12?
Castlevania in freakin 3D :O
That kid kind of looks like me when i was in 6th grade
I love how he assumes that everyone who hates Justin Bieber likes metal.
7heh
7it's his message, really, you want to focus on
This is going to be epic
7he is declaring war on Anonymous. poor bastid
02yeah, see it's almost done
02:3
I'll buy all the 3D nes/snes remakes
I don't care the cost
02*coughiwillhaxemcough*
How much did 3d add to file size
022GB per game.. max
Will SMB minus world be 3D ?
02yeah i think soo
02and i hope soo 2
i see
02:3
Are these true ports
OK
I have aproblem
the laser cutter i was going to get was $955 shipped
I want to see mini fire Mario glitch in 3D
but theres a better one that costs more
Is gameboy going to be 3D
02LOOOOOL, me 2
02GB... idk :\
but is easier to operate and has more features and has a bigger cutting bead.
Pokemon blue + 3D = win

Word - tazes
	*Hypertize*	Definition - When a girl gives you a blowjob and also licks your balls
	*Hypertize*	Example - That bitch gave me the tazes last night.

XD wowzah
/me goes back to innocent corner
and don't use urbandictionary
that site has all sorts of pervy things
Word - Tazer
	*Hypertize*	Definition - A sexual act involving taking the "shocker" (two in the pink, one in the stink) and dual-wielding. It is preformed by taking both hands and doing the "shocker" while your hands are crossed so the backs of your hands are touching. Then the tazer is finished by swiftly alternating hands back and forth while keeping your pinky fingers separated slightly to loosen up a...
...female's sphincter to cause an
	*Hypertize*	electrifying sensation.
	*Hypertize*	Example - So I was about do this chick in the butt last night, but she was a little uncooperative, so I just gave her the tazer to loosen her up instead.

He is/was my best friend.
I'm sure you can't be that bad ascendent
I keep trying to make an effort and not get entirely pissed off at him
But he's toeing the line now.
Traquilizer dart in his butt, that'll give you some peace for a time.

/me hugs back
14It's been such a long time :/
Hi floof~
She's here but may be in class atm xD
Are you on XP? XD
02Hi Auroraawr

I've already said this >.>
who are you again.?
02You have?
hm?
6yes
6many times
Well it's almost 11am for her xD
14I don't believe I've met you, you must be pretty new
07Auroraaaaaaaaaa
/me never heard that before
eh..
14But maybe not
how I got here is a story filled with drama
You don't like nick names aurora ?
/me 6is setting up for a livestream, amy be a tad idle
07how goes?^^
6I like nicknames
07ah
07Ok
6but changing my name bugs me
o.o
Ah ok
k
6I go by roara, rora, and Aurora
14maybe I know you by another name. Ah yes, she'll be in class probably
Mind if I call you floof? XD
6floof works too
k :3
07LOL
07Floof
6because that's kinda become synonimous with me
6synonymous
07Hahah
kay
~
07Aurora
07I am floofy too >/
Ok from now on you're floof to me then
07YOU
/me runs away^^
07oh Aurora
07I feel sooo silly
07you know when you were livestreaming that paw tutorial
07I was watching
/me hugs back?
07but fell asleep on the laptop straight on in the middle
07z.z
07SORRY
6LOL
6it's fine
I'm also known as
"Brother"
6it's actually recorded
Hey floof having a good day so far ?
6so you can watch at any time
07Ahhh
07Ok =D
6ok well
6just calling me floof, like seriously, wont get my attention
6just fyi
07KIK
07dfg
07f
07LOL*
Aurora it is then
14Doesn't ring any bells. When did you start coming to HoR?
/me is tired because he just woke up from a nap :3
some months ago..
14Haha, I guess I've been away for quite some time...
/me is happy to see Newberry back :3
:O
meew
*mew
I'll still call you floof if you're active, Aurora
XD
6well yeah
Should try to come here more often ^^
6if I'm around and active, I'll see it
/me curls in his corner
6but I can't respond if it doesn't call up my nick alert
No you won't, your colorblind to floof
:<
/me flees
6which only happens if you say my current name, but i'm more prone to seeing "roara" than floof
6if I chack in here and all
yah
So like
6I'm not a colorblind dog :P
I assume you're on your mac, correct?
6yep
asdfghjkl
6because of livestream
k
/me nods
6in like 5 minutes
makes sense |3
6also
?
6don't rush me
i'm not |D
6I have it on reminder now
oh k
:>
6one of my peeves os being rushed
6is
6asdfg
14Awwh thanks :)
Next time don't offer an option you won't respond to
6all is better now
:3
14i've missed everyone, but I needed a good break. Not for any particular reason. I just kinda did. You know?
6what, kuro?
6I didn't say I wont respond to it >.>
:o
Ok I'm confused now
6I said that if I happen to be idle, when I check in here I'm more often going to notice "roara" than "floof"
6because floof is used for a lot of things
alot of stuff tbh
6but roara is pretty obvious as to what it's referring to
Yeah :<
6but if I'm active and talking, like right now
6you can call me floof all you want
6and I'll assume you're talking to me

Roara
/me likes to rant when he is angry
a few minutes ago
I brb-ed to "move a few books"
:O
02They all fell down?
5min later I was starting to puck up random things from the floor
and moving them to their respective homes
02Homes LOL
then I was like "whoops" and had to tear myself away to return to here lol
02BRB, I need to get some papers
nikki just stole my steaks :(

/me stares ah her clean, neat, uncrowded bookcases "Must....RE-ORGANIZE!"
<random>
02I SEE PILLOW TALK

02Very dangerous

02Just at your other nick
12anymore time in my room and I would have been up till 4am cleaning it top perfection
12a project I am saving till tomorrow morning/afternoon
Evening.
12hai Guesst
02Hi guesst
Project you say?
/me nods
12anymore time in my room and I would have been up till 4am cleaning it top perfection
12a project I am saving till tomorrow morning/afternoon
12*to
Yeah, my room needs cleaning too
Game consoles and junk everywhere
/me lols
02I had to clean my room last 2 weeks
Broken stuff, useless stuff
And books x_x
02Just like my room!
Jk I dint mind the books
12I've had no ambition to clean my room to perfection in a few months v-v
02TOO ALIKE
12then
12I was moving books earlier
12and the urges started o3o
02I got rid of most of my old books
/me thinks drf will love this trait once we move in toget...nvm
/me HIDES
I have a few still lying around
._. don't bring me to into this
02I have a bookcase, still filled up
Whatever you do
12Hyper
12I have multiple shelves
12ALL filled up >_<
I have no space left
None
02Wow... Bookworms
12AFTER I donated about 50ish books to the library ._.
Not even for a book
12AND I have more downstairs
I have drawers full
Shelves lined
Closets piled
You name it
And that's with mostly games not books
02My whole left side of my room is filled with my Computer, and bookcase
Huh... it appears as though Amphenol has made the most unkillable Ethernet switch in human history.
http://www.rjswitch.com/IP67-Military-switch-en.htm
Same setup as mine, hml
I have 2 rooms to my room
/me hmms
The back room is where my bed is
12game and tv space
And where I am now
02LOL
124sq ft
Right next to the shelf
12book space
1220sq ft
02I only have 1 big decent sized room
12o3o
02With a built in closet
Ahead of that is a radiator/work desk
At my home, I "own" three rooms.
The effective closet of a bedroom.
At least our rooms are different.
02A very big built in closet filled with clothes, wires, cables, and my telescopes, and games
02I can barely get into it
The "room of work" which contains my piano, computer, TV, and is essentially the room I need to do stuff in related to my studies and my "clean" hobbies.
Any games you aren't using?
I might take them off your hands.
02It's all Junk
02Literally
Mine is 1/2 junk and 1/2 insanity
:p
02Bit of pieces of robot kits, cases, toys and just random things
And then half the furnace room. Which is filled with a wide variety of electronic bits and bobs, once house a full Wall of Computing Power, but is now recuded to File Cabinet of Computing Power. And lots of electronics cruft that I need to clean out/toss out sometime. :P
02Youre insane
/me only needs 1 room for all of his stuff
(Wall of Computing Power: A real live PDP-11/70. Holy bleep did it make the power bill explode.)
Well I'm sleep deprived
If you consider that insanity then yes
Curly!
Hi
and yay xchat didn't reset the beep sound for once ^^
how's you?
02Though I to takeover the main bedroom, and the livingroom has been "Hypertised"
(File Cabinet of Computing Power: A MicroVAX3100 M40 with a VT013 sitting on top and a cheap PC clone running FreeDOS beside it.)
02*do
I'm okay.
You?
All I need is mah room.
hungry
/me just got up and showered
I /could/ move all of my stuff into one room.
slept for aaaages
Before I forget, is Men of War good? :o
yes!
Awesome. :3 I passed out earlier today, so I'm getting some sleep back. xD
However, the end result would be a grand total of .5 square metres of open floor space. :P
02All my stuff is in 1 room, since I compact all my stuff into my closet
I could imagine...
It is? I noticed it's on sale on Steam nao, so I was wondering.
MoW's an RTS though
so it depends if it's your thing or not
MoW's an extremely detailed RTS ^^
:O
o.o
Hi Curly!
I love RTS games.
every unit has their own inventory, ammo, and the vehicles need fuel and ammo too
and there's physics!
12o3o
o.o
02Then I have all my bathroom door taken up by my closet door, and my XPS 700
D:
That's... different.
I tossed an AT grenade at var's tank once and he shot the floor in front of my guy and the AT grenade went flying a hundred feet
My grandfather's entire home is even worse.
hey where ^^
:D
12lolz
OCD doesn't do what he does
that moment's in my gamer hall of fame :3
I'm sure if a tank got a good shot at another tank it could roll it over even
12chronic messiness is a male thing Guesst
12so I'm not suprised
/me has had tanks bounce away from explosions
02So I have to not knock over anything while trying to reach it
/me hides
:o
Do I need the expansion pack, too? Or can I save my money? XD
02Hatter
/me hugs where
/me explodifies.
no
:D
you don't need it
/me doesn't have it
Okay, I must go now :O
So that can be said
already? D:
Epic.
bye T_T
Curly!
Wait
S:
D:
/me hugs where
DX
D:
And okie, thanks Curly.
And my room(s) are excessively tidy.
02I need to find the measurements for my room again
I have a bit of a compulsion with that.
/me hugs where.
D:
02My room is somewhat tidy
/me is now splattered all over the channel ):
D:?
D:
02But I cannot stand it when anybody touches my room's arrangement
D:!
/me pours Curly into a Curly-shaped mould and puts it in the fridge
/me keeps his computer halfway out into his room
/me unsplatters kari-chan
"And this is the work roo- YOU HAVE MOVED MY CHAIR ONE INCH TO THE LEFT! I WILL KILL YOU!" :P
My room is neat enough to function and Organize, but not to store things
/me opens the fridge, notices the mould and eats it.
DX
D:
It's a single player only expansio...Ewwww
02Storing is now impossible
Not worth it?
Oh psh
/me pëw pëws Strÿkër wïth döts
>:O/
;_;
02And I will never throw anything away
D:
I think I'll be going now, night all.
/me makes a Curly from the old bits
The missions in it are better than MoW, but multiplayer is really much better, especially when playing with friends
heh.
12packrat o3o
/me waves goodbye to Proto
I'm off too.
You have to
good night Proto o/
See you all in a few hours, i hope D:
Bye where.
Maybe I'll get it later.
bye where~
\o Bai Curly. :)
>:D
;_;
/me curls up and dies, then.
D:
I can't get passed the second level
/me was only joking
6Feather
Or... just avoid singleplayer. XD
10?
6I have to give up on use sharing that avatar XD
02To make it even harder to move around, I have my Wireless dongles on a stand right next to the middile of the "walkway"
/me thinks that might be a better idea.
:O
I get rid of stuff all the time
If it doesn't work, take it apart and salvage what's left
Throw the rest away
6because a bunch of people are gonna have one >.>
/me 6runs
you're defending with one tank, three AT guns, and a bunch of dudes again like dozens of tanks and a hundred men >.>
10?!
6unless
6wait
/me is revivified
10already? DDDDD:
lol
6no
6ok
6so
make more weapons
6here's the thing
02soo
6Xai has one
10Yeah..
and they can shoot at the thing you're supposed to be defending
MoW doesn't work that way
And watch TychoCelchuu's MoW videos to learn how to play
not the singleplayer anyway
6and kyu's been buggering me
6for one
12o3o
6and i'm like stfu
okay bye <3 everyone
6but
10Just say no LOL
bye where ^^
6i was gonna draw one
yes :O
/me salutes.
6then I realized
6I can draw something else
Help, I'm drowning in a sea of fangirls!
/me 6runs
By- Fine.
Tycho's videos are great ^^
12Feather
10XD
:p
o>
12that made me think
10Also, Aurora, PM?
12of those vids we were shown in school
6of course
12about stranger safety
12"Just say no!"
12o3o
02NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I guess I'll get out right now c
Need sleep
02But were all talking to strangers
/me hides
Sleep
oh, and if you ever go against me, don't use mines DX
mines are the most tediously annoying things ever >_>
hehe
and you basically end up winning because it takes like 10 minutes to get rid of them <_<
/me places mines.
I remember from kindergarten those "Beware of stranger" videos.
/me lays lotsa mines around Curly to protect her
I was thinking that a mortar or artillery might clear mines better
in a game with a time limit >_>
12No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
O:
12one for each of you
I didn't think about that
/me flees
/me is dumb
And the joke the teacher made to the parents when the came to pick us up. :P
are not
Damnit. I can't autowin now.
am too D:
D:
Curly is smarts
She is.
/me runs away
/me lols
12btw
"Well... if all else fails, apply boot, knee, or sledgehammer to the crotch area."
But she's silly and doesn't think often enough. :D
12LOL!
12anyway
that makes me dumb D:
No.
/me hits.
/me runs from the TST, since everybody will attempt to kidnap hime
I'm trying to help.
02NO
02NOOO
12my teacher told us that strangers could very easily be drug dealers
02:o
12so like:
12my mom
12told me to tell her
02Are you a drug dealer?
/me shot
12that since SHE is a stranger
12she must be one too XD
T_T
12(coming from an innocent 5yr old btw) XD
02DRUGGIES
02XD
D:

mmm, I think I ran out once with a truck, that'd be it
I run out all the time with my trucks :(
and even then only on the big maps
and I just buy a new truck when one runs out xD
I never found out how to refuel properly, I know how to scavenge fuel from another vehicle though
I do so love repairing and looting tanks

07Hey Andrew
07How are you
comrade BF
welcome
hey
how are you?
good, in college atm
are you?
writing the first draft of a presentation about rifles
we have one guy in my team who never appears
SO
12yay Nick :D
we've decided to offload all the hard tasks on to him, so that when we haven't done them we can just say that we agreed that he would do them
hi Umbreon o//
what college jou at?
lol?
and Rifles?
yes
rifles
you at a military college or somethign?
rifling
shooty things
hey Umbreon!
no, I'm not
lol
we just have to do the presentation for product design
I'm doing the "history" of rifles
so anyway how you like Jardie land like
ah
it's alright
a lot of homeless people
how far back you going?
err
15th century germany, apparently
if its like WW1/WW2 I could be able to shed some light
ugh too far back
I have one book saying rifling was invented in Nuremburg, another in Augsburg
so I'm just saying "probably invented in 15th century germany, but nobody really knows lol"
hmm
15th century sounds a bit far back for rifles
and even then, only becuase people had to
or, that's what my two-page article on rifles says <.<
but it was found that they were actually decent for killing people as well as hunting, so the British army began developing it's own military rifles in retalliation
before then rifles weren't really used for warfare becuase the projectiles of the time were smooth lead balls that quickly degraded the rifling and the gunpowder of the time quickly clogged a weapon's rifling
neither of which really mattered too much when you're hunting, apparently
lol
muskets caused terrible injuries they were like mini cannon balls
yeah
but woefully inaccurate hence why they turned to rifles
hmm my lesson starts in 15 mins best get some food down me
laters

so small black birds normally nosedive?
eh?
*do
14not sure
14maybe not
because one just nosedived into the library roof
14HAHA
and I have a sneaking suspicion it just died
14awesome
14well
o-O
14it probably just passed away and missled at the roof
14that's what I think
14if it like, did that
14because I'm sure only birds of prey can do that

6!Umbreon
/me now belongs to Aurora for 19 minutes
6<3

148D
12lol
12what i wanted Quilava to see it
mike's compy is all slow today. it was waaaay faster before it updated itself
6because I disapprove of the ownership script
149th time now ^^
6except for the bree and espeon ones
6because for me, owning them is practically a meme
6<3
x3
12hi Aurora
12:3
14I'm getting PS btw
It's worth infinite reposts.
12stop saying PS May
14no D:
6lol why
12i keep thinking you are saying playstation at first
12XD
lol
14LOL
same
14silly
6pleasde don;t tell me you're buying it
14because, PS is good for spriting
14no lol
14pirating
14always
6....ABSOLUTELY NOT LOL
12May
6PS IS CRAP FOR SPRITING
14is not
12i think MS Pain is perfect for spriting
i woke up this morning and nothing was open on it. there was a little bubble thingy by the system tray saying it had updated
6use MS paint
14noway
squeak
6yeah
14I animate stuff
12i only use photoshop
12to make the sprites transparent backgrounds
then get adobe fireworks for easymode animations
/me dies
6using PS for spriting is like buying a Ferrari and driving 10mph on open highway
14lol
well, look at it this way
14well, I tried GIMP2 for sprites
/me :3
14didn't like it
6and I'm being serious lol
it's really like stealing a ferrari and doing so
6well yeah
12~slang espeon
because she doesn't buy it
i might play some games in a little bit
:D
6GIMP fails
14but PS is good for drawing

07Hi
14yes
6hi
/me looks at the prince
12lol typo
lol.
14I have MSPaint
does he ever say anything?
07LOL
14and I don't exactly like it
07I like Photoshop
07but
07I also
07edit photographs
07so yeah
14yes
07thats my main reason
and is he a frog?

07I liked SAI too honestly
:з / :З / :3 / :³ / є: / E: / :Э / Є: / :э
07Would have stuck with it
6for that you usually get PS essentials
/me sings along
07if it had a bloody text feature
07Ah
6because essentials is like photoshop, just not as expensive
6but it has photo editing
6i hated it though because I wanted to draw
well, the expensive part isn't really a factor...
most of the time
but I'll zip it
6lol
07Espeon
as in, my mouth
not
07ESPEON
07when do you
07want to meet up
07wheeeeeeeeeen
14well the thing is, Aurora
14I can't find crap
14to edit the brushes
14to my liking
through the fire and the flames we carry ooooooon!
12~slang umbreon
when does it fit for you to meet? o3o
06Word -04 Umbreon
0406Definition -04 Umbreon has a great advantage against psychic Pokemon but has a great disadvantage against fighting Pokemon. Unlike espeon, it's more like a fox type Pokemon.
0406Example -04 If you want eevee to evolve into this, train it at night. It must always win in battles and gain experience points ONLY at night to evolve into an Umbreon.

03hence PAL is correct
No. :o
03honestly, PAL *is* better quality than NTSC, just most stuff isn't made in that format
03and it's just converted
03but for European bands, when the videos are shot in that format..
Nah, it was Iggy after.

So why dislike shooters?
well its mainly 1st person shooters Just really hate that mode. I do like some shooters though like sin and punishment star successor
12I like third-person shooters.
12Like Starwars battlefront, and war for cybertron
So you don't like CoD? There is a 3rd person mode in it.
call of duty..... pass
On 6 anyway.
12.....

14LOLOLOL

/me likes Win98 better than Vista
brb
02Nope The suckish Book
02A WHOLE CHAPTER
5I like Emmett. But no one else. <3
5Have you actually READ Twilight, HML?
I like all computers
besides

5At least one book?

Hell I like WinME better than Vista
I can be a successful pirate nao :D
14I tried
its a vista
14set it down
02Nope, and never planning to
14after
Hell I like WinME better than Vista..
14sparkling
10Everyone uses the excuse "I read the first few pages and got bored"
021 word
14but you know
anything but a fucking mac OS is better then it
14then again
10same for the movie
damn up arrow
/me likes this girl at his school :3
02But I don't like books anyway
5Well you can't really say it sucks if you've never read one. ;P
10which is pretty lame if you ask me
5I read the first book, so I can.
03you know what else is lame
hell
02So it doesn't make much difference
07I've watched the movies
maybe even a Unix is better
but its too old
03the fact that Twilight totally stole their cover image from Snow White.
5I do nooooooooot. D:
07but I can't stay awake through them
02You Lived?
07=P
and didnt have a mouse
02Phew
so
03I saw Vampires Suck :P
Vista > Unix
Vista froze and gave me BSODs like everyday
5I don't fangirl over Edward Cullen. /runs
02Cool
07ha
Worse than ME
14yes you doooooooooo

02I smell a !fangirl
MEWTWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Dun have it now
10if you've seen every Twilight saga book and movie, then you can come complain to me that you hate it
5I fangirl over Emmett because he's too cool.
5WHERE
5WHERE IS HE
14LOL
it only freezes during some games
10but until then, keep your mouth shut :U
5 /armed with Master Ball
in which I made it not freeze
5MIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINE.
since I did something wrong with the mods
14I'm glad I added him in
14;3
02!Fangirls are so silly sometimes
have 3 Linux OSes and 2 XP's and 1 Win2000 now
DEMYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYX!
5lolololol
*wasan00bbackthenwithmods*
And I think she likes me back but I can't tell....... she's very logical about everything
/me waves Emmett around RP4L
3 XP's
HIBARIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!
o-o
07you don't have to look at all of something to decide you don't like it
14fangirls lol
02CHHHHHHHHHEEEEEESSSSSSSEEEEE
5He's too cool to be in Twilight
5but I don't obsess over him like I obsess over..
oooooh!
5um...
07you just have to find one thing you don't like about it lol
5Mewtwo
/me help?
Win7 is awesome though
14indeed
5or Odo. From DS9. <33333
14EXCALIBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUR
14<3
02XD
02BURN
14YOU BURN
/me punts HML
yay for girls
Hmmm
D:
10well Kyu
They actually improved instead of degraded
/me glows red hot
10many people honestly don't care either way about twilight
/me charges at May
10they just claim to hate it, since it's overrated
5But I'm not one of those fangirls that thinks Mewtwo is worth my affections. HAHAHAno. I actually think those kind of fangirls are kind of creepy. He's fictional and he's a mutant kitty.
14...Waaaaait
02You admited it!
Kitten: Thank you very much Kitten, but I'm actually talking to her and being honest with her, so I don't think I need help quite yet :3
5Admitted what what?
/me hides
14people write stories of little girls falling in love with Mewtwo?
erm, talking with her and being frank with her**
02Yup
14are you serious?
5I HATE THOSE STORES
02Just like SANTA CLAUS
5OMIGOSH I HATE THEm
/me runs
5**THEM
/me shot
14THAT IS SO WRONG
5They do, May, they do. DDD:
where would I find the disk?
Frank is a pretty cool name
ij C:?
14BUT I KIND OF WANT TO READ THEM JUST TO SEE
Why not frank?
07you're confusing opinions and facts DRF
/me flails
5Well usually they're not that little... like 16-25 years old...
02Just like a werewolf and a girl
oops
03regardless. LOL
so so you should not be being frank with her
02Not the best match
07you only need one error to have a bad opinion of something
/me will have to correct the situation then
03Fact: Apple products are overpriced
I could be frank if I felt like it
Thank you for the advise :)
5May, just look at FF.net and search "Mewtwo". HE NEVER TRAVELS WITH MALES. WTH. D|

02Hi
12darnit
12does someone here want to do me a favor?
6what kind
02What is it?
12figure out what time i DCed
12actually that's silly
6I can't tell
12why am i asking
12[16:16:32] * Skylands breaks all sunglasses in existence
12[19:13:18] * Disconnected
12i'm pretty sure i DCed somewhere between that time line lol
6....
02Hmmm...
6lol 3 hour dead period
02That is a good question..
02Since they both are ON a Planet
03SKynet.
12i'm not sure what is happening
02And Skynet has ME
14hmm
14brb
02HAL is well next to jupiter
02And he can't even fight\
Yes. But HAL also can't get nuked or flung through a portal.
(Or more hilarious the "infinitely falling nuclear missile" :P
/me fluffles the kitten, snuggles her and gives her a treat ^-^
:)
:p
noooooo
you smell funny though :p
I need to go out with this girl first :3
/me thinks she caught herself a cute girl :3
02Wow, david after dentist has 69,940,167 views....
o-o
3o.o
Well, assuming Aperture Science is in the US.
Then Skynet needs to send Russian missiles.
02Or Geneva...
02Or whereever the LHC is
Which can give thirty minutes warning.
More then enough time to have fun with portals. :P
02But, they haven't told us how large the RANGE of the Portals are, or how far away from their source they can be
02It also appears that Only 2 Portals can be active at a time
02So a large assult of missles, from different directions would be a problem
02To add to the problem, they also have to be on a specific surface and angle
/me wonders if he is thinking about this too much

02But that cutscene solves it all
iblame the pod of eyes
And hello HML
02Hi
LL
What exactly was bad about Other M?
12I haven't played it yet
02Everybody seems to dislike it
12but
12what I've heard
/me shudders
:/
I've heard it appeals to the new school gaming crowd.
That means it's easy
02I want hard SNES style games
Lol
Along with that, the story turns the series on it's head
Same HML
I want a hard but not stupidly hard game
:|
That's why I skipped it
Sonic 4 tried to balance that
First nintendo wii game I ever skipped.
12lolz
Still failed
12I'm skipping it too
Sonic 4 is uber easy
Levels were either easy or just mindblowingly difficult
And heh
02Though MMX was the perfect dificulty
Moving on...
12because I want to keep the Samus from MP in my head
Final boss
That is HELL.
02I know
ORLY
02I took me 9 tries
9 of your 60
02All on camera I recored the Ending
02I was so happy
I'll skip it until I can get it for a lower price.
02Quote: " I beat DE GAME YO I BEAT DE GAME!!"
OK, I'll be done now
:P
The game I'll get next within the next few days is super scribblenauts
/me dances to the rolling of rick
Better in every way possible.
02I totally forgot about that
It came out yesterday
After that it's goldeneye on November 7th
Then skyward sword
Then MvsC3
Then portal 2
Then the 3rd
02Oh boy..another zelda which I won't get

Do you hate the series, HML?
12Portal 2 <3
02You mean march 2011
12Skyward Sword <3 <3 <3
02No, I just Fail at itXD

02But I did beat Wind Waker
12Hyper

02The game wasn't too difficult until I made the mistake
12Hyper
12there is a Key
12that not many know about
12unless they already played thru once
12did you get the one in the VERY first toom?
12*room
02I've checked all the rooms... that I can reach
02And the main area was practally cleared, And the well
There are only 4 unwinnable situations in OoT
Yours ain't one
/me lols
12Guesst
12I found an unwinnable situation for trying to 100% the game
12in my friend's OoT
12and Hyper
Meow
12in the VERY first room
12with the Wolfos
I want Portal 2
|D
02Yeah?

Don't we all
12go up it and there's a key on top
12and same Chime~
LL is now awesome for <3ing Portal 2
02Where do I put it again?
/me flees
12umm
02I went as far as the tunnel that moves from the FLOOR to the Roof
12on the way through the twisty hallways
02AKA the twisty
02Okay
12go that way
12if I'm right
02There is a chest?
12you'll get the bow in the next room
12wait
02I was looking for that too
12did you get PAST that twisty room into a hallway with paintings of a Poe?
02I Might of have...
12it has stairs
12that lead down
02I havent played it in a while
12to a locked door next to a torch
12well PLAY EET!
02OOT
/me is going to get kicked and knows it o3o
12(EET meaning it)
03kicked for what? O.o
12flooding XD
/me ish saying a lot quickly
02I also have my wii in my closet
02I'll try to play on the weekend
12just remember where the Key is
02Oh, does anybody have Muramusia- The Demon Sword?
12first room, on the right
12no
/me thought that was me o-o
It's the demon blade
Not sword
02Woops
/me is bored
I know someone who plays it
That's about it
02Anyway, is it good, becuase that is the ALT. gift for Okami if my friends could not find it
/me hopes they did find a copy of Okami
/me is watching a movie
It's an amazing game.
For a sidescroling beat-em-up
02I've seen some gameplay already
Amazing art style, great battle mechanics
Oh so you know
:p why ask?
12Okami o3o
/me should kidnap her Wii into her room
12to finish Okami ><
02LOL
14indeed
14finish if
14*it
Yet another game I'm ashamed to have never played
02Thats another reason why I might not want Okai'
:(
02Since I may stop after a while...
02And NEVER finish it
That's rare for me to do
When I start a game, finishing it is a requirement for life as I know it.
12lolz
12Guesst
02I still need to finish SMG2 and nSMBwii
12that's why I'm playing HL2 and BS2 o3o
12and Hyper
If I don't finish it, I keep the game to go back to in a year or so
12dun bother with SMG2 ><
12the last 120 stars are EWWW
I've just finished nsmbwii 100% a month ago
02I MUST FINISH IT

Lemme guess. On Windows?
NO.

Hai, Kitteh!
It's slower on Windows, I've noticed.
Snow Leopard / BootCamp: Windows 7.
:D
I'd need a DVD to do that, as much as I'd want to
Why?
Because Windows 7 is larger than a CD.
lol
a kitten hm?
True.
Speaking of DVD's, etc....
My DVD drive in my MacBook Pro died... lol
I sent it to Apple, and they asked me if I wanted to upgrade to a slot-load Blu-Ray drive.
I'm like YES! :D

Windows 7 is weird. It doesn't even support telnet.
07Hm
It does
07telnet?
You need to install it
Anyway, off to work again. Bye.
By default, it doesn't, and it should.
07Ok!
Now, I'll see you all in a few hours.
telnet isn't something 99% of users will even be aware of
07Ok ^v^
never mind use
K bye
07I know of it
07but
07uh
Not many people use Telnet
depends on what it's set up to use I believe
though to simplify it it's an outdated form of remote access
07I accidentally used it once
07but what IS it
I only installed it just to see this: http://lifehacker.com/373571/watch-star-wars-in-text-via-telnet

Class in 20 minutes. :q I feel like I have some vital homework that I need to be doing today for the other classes, but nothing's comin' to mind...
i'rpowpo'wc'huú :>
07lol
What is (f+g)(x) if f(x)=x+4 and g(x)=x-4?
07Hey
(x-4)+4... so... I thought it'd be x
07ew
But it's wrong. :<
07I hate f of x equations D:
XP They were easy yesterday. I'm almost certain it should be just x, but it didn't give me the point.
Well, apparently it was 2x, but I don't see how...
07oh
07that's because you were thinking f(g(x))
07(f+g)(x) is just addition
07o3o
Ffffrazz. XP
Oh, okay, I see now.
Well, I don't feel like doing any more of these. XP This math homework's not due till the 16th anyway.

14Feather, I've been doing the sunglasses since we started spamming it
10no, because everyone is taking Aurora and my meme :/
07HAH

07then you don't get what a meme is at all.
14^
you must realize
if it's oon the internet
it's everyone's
/me flees
also isn't a maeme making fun of something in media, like TV or something?
o.o

wut
10I was lagging
wb?
k
10had to restart
14Feather
07[13:32:52] <May> ^
07XD
14saying that to everyone is like saying a certain color belongs to someone and only them
14trends happen
yus
10I don't want to start an arguement <.< I just wish people would leave the sunglasses thing alone
you can say you started the trend
:3
Oh snaps
10because it was a Featheroara thing
03what sunglasses thing>?
10and you guys are ruining it :/
07Roara's having a good time with it
14well lol, but no offense of anything, exclusions are not nice
Worry not, Lady Feather. I don't even like so I shan't partake. :3
07you're just being a dip XP
14and everyone shares
10Even Aurora is getting annoyed
10It's not just me >.>
14well, she needs to learn that people copy one another
10It's such a simple request though
07we've gone through how many years of copydrama here and you guys still get ticked off?
03Feather
03it's like
03I request that people don't use o3o
03but nobody listens
03so
14oh I'm sure it is, like how telling someone just to stop is just going to work
03:|
/me trows *sunglasses* into the ocean, then eated by a whale
I AM THE BARBER
10I'm not getting ticked off, just annoyed
/me misread Barber for Barbie
03I'm getting annoyed too :
03*:P
07there isn't much of a difference
10Yes there is
wait wtf
03but the point is this is the Internet, people do what they want
14if she seriously is getting annoyed by it, then the both of you need to go read past arguments
Kyu
[10:39] <%Aurora> I kick/kill for the enjoyment
As long as it doesn't break the rules, people can do as they please.
you make the WIERDIST INSULTS

Hi
04morning
14hi Lyon
02morning Lyon
You call people food
04hi May
07hush, tacocat!
04hey Xeli
10Yeah, well
:3
XD
LIKE THAT LOL
04hello Feather, Chime, HML and everyone
10there is a "respect other people's wishes" rule
anyone can render something?
04hey Xeli
;x
/me hugs
07and what happened to "I don't want to start an argument"
If everyone respected everyone's wishes people couldn't say anything in case someone got annoyed. There's a difference between reasonable wishes and not so reasonable :P
/me flops
14and people don't just stop insatnly Feather
14Aurora would know that by now
10I'm trying best not to start an arguement
07because it's gone down to that already
10I'm staying calm
10but you calling me a dip doesn't help :/
07people can argue calmly
Yes
....
and arguement IS arguing calmly
this is a bunch of fail.
otherwise it's just stupidity
:3
14tbh, this wish is highly unreasonable
14everyone can use it
04whoa, what's going on o-o
I mean
14if you didn't want it used in the first the place
14then you shouldn't have been using it all over
14people are going to catch on to it lol
10Ok, wow, it was only a simple request, but I guess you guys don't give a crap
10now I'm not in the mood to be here v_v
YAY for defensive mode instantly.

How long?
7And FFF.
hi Kipi
7Do realize whatshisname, the creator of said media, says that he doesn't really change physically.
7Stop lagging, me. D:
7And May?
14so you're saying Yugi had a split-personality?
7No.
14because I don't think getting taller and more deadly is a split personality
14so he is changing physcially
7Well, you know the story.
7He doesn't actually grow a foot and vocal cords lengthen.
7And eyes... and hair... and clothes...
7It's all artistic.
7May, am I lagging?
14well, that seems odd to me
14no, not really
Kinda like in DBZ?
/me hides
7O_o
cuz it's true
7Puh-lease.

How they change hair, size, and voice
DBZis awesome ^^

07Heya Kipi ^c^

/me hugs Ray back!
7And May:
Either way, they still transform kinda the same. XD
7About the lack of Dan Green in later series:
7This is one reason I prefer GX over 5Ds.
7They reference the original series ALL THE TIME.
14I never watched the rest of the series
14I stopped as soon as I discovered there was no Yugi
7o.o
7Lol
7No, Yugi's still in GX.
Lawl
14hmm
14well
14it must have been way later then
7Bakura appears in one scene.
7Tristan and Tea in the last episode.
7And Ra is used.
02Every time that kaiba smiles one more puppy is dead T.T
7Uhh...
14but no one else
7Ushio is in 5Ds.

02Not moar fangirlism
/me hides
7O_o
7No, that was not fangirlism.
7My source of fangirlism is lagging.
7KYU
XD
02XD
02I want a turn!
WHAT
7About that topic above about people not realizing Dan Green changes... :P
lolwut
5EW DAN GREEN.

:з <-- this face looks cute LOL
02Is it really all artistic?
/me runs
/me shot
7Yes, HML. :|
7And maybe for something for fangirls to look at.
7That's the reasoning for Riku's inclusion in Coded, anyway.
02I AM A bIG BOI NOW
02That is Yugi
02AKA. Mr. Deep Voice
07Quan
07why wouldn't all the stuff happen?
7And NOW here comes the fangirlism, HML.
07it's called "magic"
07o3o
7Well, there's that, but why would people not realize it, then?
Wat
Quan no
7In the early manga, Tea realizes that not-Dan Green changes, but in voice only, when she's blindfolded.
03:з
yeah
but nobody else does
Wasn't something like that on the TV once?
7ô.o
Like, a more child-friendly version XD
erm
7Explain?
well
on the TV show
7You mean anime?
YEP
7Hmm...
*caps
It showed Yugi and Tia at a restaraunt
7Tea*
7X3
k
X3
7Ah, this is after Duelist Kingdom.
She ended up getting blindfolded
7The date, right?
7No?
I think
7That's the first anime series.
I DUN REMMEBER
DUN JUDGE ME
/me flees
7Same thing--manga adapted to anime.
7Same event. D:
7Pre-Duelist Kingdom.
/me 7releases a spurt of fangirlism stuff.
02-Fangirl Filter Activated-
/me wonders why the chat is empty....
7LOL
7And Kyu.
7About the Orichalcos arc... :|
07it was lame D:
7Why? D:
02Hmm, do YOU know why it is soo empty?
7Wangst, I'm assuming?
7Character supposed flanderization and exaggeration?
07because it was too off from the main storyline
^
7So... what about Noah's arc or the KC Grand Championship? Same thing?
07noah's was lame too lol
07and i forget the kc arc o.o
07what was that one again
7Right after Orichalcos.
7With the Marluxia Expy.
7*trope*
14MY GOD WHAT'S WITH THIS ORANGE WALL
7XD
02What wall?
7I'd say that the Grand Championship was mostly pointless, except that the antagonist reminded me of Marluxia.
ew
02All I see is blanks
Noah's Arc
that was confusing
7It's Kaiba fanservice.
7Good for whoever likes him.
7:3
7Oh, yeah:
07me
07XP
7Noah himself is an expy of season zero Kaiba.
7Green hair, white clothes.
Hello peoples
7Jerkier than he normally is.
7Oh, yeah:
7Noah's arc has one good thing to it, though: soundtrack.
(And that sans serif fonts must die and long, horrible and painful death.)
7And the puns, I guess. Even if they're sorta lame.
7And a stupid yet fascinating jarring of edutainment and genre switching.
7And that scene with Kaiba throwing cards at Tristan while a robot monkey attacks him and they run away on motorcycles.
5And it's only /his words/ ahahaha.
7Really. O_o
02?.?
Ah.
Well, again, people being artsy is the explanation.
And they deserve a very rapid, and very firm application of a boot to the head.
Quan
7:|
that monkey
it made me wat XD
also Quan
Wasn't that the same series with the Lavyathin?
(jewish creature lol)
7Leviathan? Yes.
5But it could be worse.. Font's not too bad as long as I pause.
heh
7I particularly liked the Orichalcos arc because it was darker than the rest of the series.
7AND IT WASN'T IN ANY TOURNAMENT.
7Oh, yeah. And Dan Green fanservice.
(Unless you could those MadTV sketches that parody Korean soap opreas. :P )
07well I'm off
7Don't get me wrong, the fanservice isn't the only reason I liked the Orichalcos arc. XD

7Well, the manga I'm reading is chopped off at this point and skips 10 chapters forward.
02:(
5What are you reading?
7Guess.
7From the above fantopic, guess.
5Oh, heh.
7O_o
02Darnit
7Hey there.
7And ooh.
7If this side manga occurs at the same time the 'filler' arcs in Yu-Gi-Oh do...
/me pounces Curly
/me falls over
hey Ari~
/me <-- tiredface
/me 7now has two sources why the gist of the Orichalcos arc is not bad. :P
02Interesting
cig time ^-^
is it just me or is it annoying when everyone thinks you're an immigrant :I
i still haven't made mike help me get dressed yet today
<--- tiredface and happyface
We finally elected new representatives
/me bets if she was white people wouldn't assume she was an immigrant
:o
oh well _-_
/me tickles Curly
are you by any chance asian? :D
Curly: Yeah, being white is pretty cool, unfortunately
/me rolls away
yes I am
XD
Hehe
I'm 100% Canadian though >_>
My sister is asian \o/
Because Canadian is obviously a race
:P
it's a culture!
you're hairy :P
like a bear
or a lack of culture maybe
7xlz;faskldrjas
/me 7needs to find chapter 41 of the manga somewhere. D:
Curly, do you know mandrin
no
that sucks.
I don't know any Asian languages >.>
I need someone who knows mandrin.
/me knows English and French
French sucks too.
/me squeeks and squirms
it does DX
/me would have rather learned Japanese :I
well maybe i'll give you one :p
why do we need to learn french when only one province speaks it and that province wants to seperate from canada
it was French immersion Spyro
I did it voluntarily
4 years of French immersion >.>
why don't we have Japanese immersion D:
I like the Spanish language much more than French
I dont know anything about the issue.
if Quebec seperated they'd be taking the second biggest city with them >.>
whats in quebec we need anyways
Nothing.
I have no idea
/me has never really paid attention
just angry french canadians.
me either
ontario has a lot of manufacturering.
so we need them./
I think one of the best universities in Canada is in Montreal
quebec probably has lots of bread.
02Mah Cherri
/me runs
My aunt when to university in quebec.
5lolwut?
we should just get a lot of huge drilling machines and seperate quebec and push them off into the ocean. they can be their own little continent.
02Look, the moon! The moon! The moon came out!
/me points to the Half Moon ouside
Canada probably needs the population, resources, and military personell from Quebec
I think you guys should lose Quebec and annex part of the U.S.
/me 7blinks.
Washington, Montana, just whatever's touching the U.S. border
I am french! I surrendor!
we want alaska back.
That way, everything's a little more even
we should invade washington
7Well, that figures; something odd musta've happened for not-Dan Green's LP counter to go to 98. O_o
and take over your costco.
and Target.
You don't want Alaska
Trust me
I went to alaska
its cool.
14how's the moon doing?
14TROLOLOOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
02Let's rock, baby!
/me runs
Every Canadian stereotype from the U.S. actually is accurate in Alaska
They really do use phrases like "don't cha know?" and "eh?" and stuff
it's kind of funny how Canada is the States upside down
02-A *Hyper* Metal Lugia appeared-
south is the US north and north is the US south
alaskians love their guns as much as people from the south
02-The HML wants to battle!-
More so
They have the most liberal gun laws in the nation
id actually move to alaska.
The Washington Examiner seems to be rather... stupid: http://failblog.org/2010/02/09/news-fail-4/
I don't know about Alaska but I know a few people who've worked at the Arctic
they don't recommend it >.>
alaska is the only place id ever move away from bc
and I dont really want to move that badly.
02Like the Spanish Kid taking Spanish class
I don't think there are many places I'd trade Vancouver for <.<
/me really would like to move to BC
Vancouver is too much city for me.
I'm planning on visiting in the winter
02There going to do well anyway
I've always lived in big cities
/me was born in Winnipeg
except maybe Duncan... but I barely remember that city :X
chilliwack is good, we can go to vancover if we need to.
5So I wouldn't call the Washington Examiner all that fail after all.
/me is hoping to get Canadian citizenship while the laws are pretty cool about it
if I could id move up past whistler.
canada is a free for all for immigration.
5There are native speakers in my AP Spanish class after all. ;P
so I've been watching old pokemon episodes all day
and I'm convinced that ash is a [censored]ing moron
you basically have to buy from the gangsters.
my uncle is getting an awesome toy
I don't mind strict gun laws
7Hmm...

7Well, I finished that unfinished manga. :|

03Target will prob...oh hey
03do you know if Target is having an "exclusive" set?
03as in, they do that a lot
03where there's some bonus disc that comes with it
03or a fancy cover
03or somethign
6As far as I know, there's no exclusives for this movie
12huh?
03hm, OK
03well anyway I'll prolly just buy it at Target when I'm home this weekend

03Aurora, you said it'll be $25 at Target?
03for how long, do you know? Like the first week?
6no
6I don't know
03OK
6I can't imagine it dropping in price for several weeks
03it's prolly the first week
03no
03it won't drop price
03it'll get more expensive
03I almost know more about Target than you do since I used to shop there so much
/me runs
03usually when stuff comes out, they have it at a special "sale" price for a week, then it geos up $5-10 to make it closer to "list" price
03hence why I try to buy stuff right away XD
6I never pay attention
6if i'm ever in a hurry like that
6I don't pay attention to price

03<bluesun> if it's anything like the JP one the ID will be something like 'Progress'

6what
6no
6dropped
03just multiply it by 0.92
03erm
03..oh
6so 1990 should be higher
02Well times 13.64 by .92 or 1.18
03ah yeah OK

03then multiply it by 1.08

I forget I was online here it was so quite o.o
02How are you both?
you're welcome :3
I'm doing pretty good
02glad to hear that ^^
4Ray, I've been all right. Excited for the big Texas - Nebraska game today, but unfortunately I can't watch it... I have a marching band competition the same time. ><
03hm
03you're trying to watch the football game?
03I know the U of M game is at the same time as that one, XD
4Ugh, I wish I could DRF. But I CAN'T. I'll be on the FIELD. In an UGLY UNIFORM. ><;;
03LOL
03well
03there's a site called espn3.com
4Game's at 2:30, performance at three. And we have to stay and watch other baaands.
4I don't have a smartphone.
03They keep replays of all the football games for at least a week
03no no
03I mean
03when you get home
4IT'S NOT THE SAME FFFFFF
4IT'S TO BE
03o.o
4IN
4THE
4MOMENT.
03um
03OK?
4This is literally the biggest game of the YEAR.
03I'm not a sports person myself so I don't care. XDV
03-V
03Want me to call you and spoil who wins?
/me HIDES
4Even if we go to the national championship there's nothing quite as big as this.
4LOL, I'll be getting score updates, don't worry. T
03you know, I remember when I was in high school
03someone wanted to know what was happening
03so they literally marched with earbuds in
03and they had a little radio in their pocket
03and they were listening to the game via that LOL
4The people who run OMI (where I'm going) always call out score updates and time updates.
03that would be good enough for me
03I honestly don't get what there is to like about watching football
4Because they know we're all sacrificing our gametime to be there.
03I was at a game once
03and someone was all "OMG THAT PLAY, DID YOU SEE THAT???"
03and I was like "Um, sure?"
03it was just some dude getting tackled, IMO nothing special XD
03I really only care when someone scores
03then it's like whee
4It's just big because at the Championship game last year, Texas basically cheated and won at the last minute. So this year, here in Nebraska, it's been OMGREVEEEEEEEEENGE since December 1st last year.
03Heh
03yeah, we lost to our rivals last week. :(
4Dudes getting tackled is the best. D: Nebraska thrives on defense. They even get special practice jersies that are black. Thus, Blackshirts.
03People from the rival school were going crazy, they pretty much vandalized the place >_>
4Oh, um, I meant to see that game but I didn't, DRF. ><
4What was the score?
03um
03I don't remember exactly
03MSU won
03like 32-10 or something crazy
4GWAAAAAAH ok.
4Eh, that's not that bad.
03it was a pretty big victory
03...
03well IMO if it's more than 14 apart it's big XD
4My school slaughtered the other school like 56 - 7. ^^;
03oh woah

12lol Quilava
HMMMM???
12if i had a nickle for everytime i wished i had a fixed die
fixed die?
12i die
not right now. they're on my laptop
12that always flips heads
/me nods
12sorry i should explain first
12in pokemon instead of flipping coins you are allowed to use dice to flips instead
02|Bye Nick
12basically the way it works is you flip a die, if it lands on an even number its considered heads
i've just been using mike's computer
12if it lands on an odd number its considered tails
12ah XD
You should link them when you get your laptop -- I bet you two are adorable together ^^
12<random>
12it'd be nice to have a dice that is tampered with so it will likely flip heads
maybe i will ;)
i'll have to upload them though
Do you both use the same wireless router?
we used to
i moved into an appartment in town
:o
lol
and right now i'm living with mike while he's taking care of me
Ah.

12ohhhhhh~
12what's not to love about THIS song~?
12well
12D:
12it's repetitive
12except that almost ALL of TP's songs are almost exactly the same >-<;
12the same melody, at least
12and yes
12I just criticized a LoZ game o3o
12lol
12you didn't
12you crited the music
12not the game itself
12even if the music can make or break a game
12music is part of the game
12just imagine if guitar hero had no music
12XDDD
12and criting a part means criting the who-LOL
12*sits there holding a guitar and nothing else* "did i beat the game yet?"
12XD
12then GH would be GOOD! :O
/me flees
12hai Guesst
12you missed it
12I criticized a LoZ game o3o
/me flees
Okay, nobody and I mean nobody will believe what happened today to me
I'm still in shock
12o-o
no really, I nearly got killed
12try me
'Someone attempted to hit my head with 2 apples in a car
02What?
12o-O wow
So they were stalking me and targeting me specifically
12O_O
12WHAT
02Ouch..
I was on my bike as well
12someone put a hit out on you
12did you take down the license plate number?
02THose evil monsters
Fell off and scraped my knee up good
I was in shoch both times, so no
shock*
/me faceclaws
12the rule of thumb
I did absolutely nothing
12maybe it wasn't intentional but simply a matter of bad luck
12if an idiot tries something in a car
12get the plate >_<
12still, Umbre
12it shows that person should be less careless
12i know
12i know
02Throwing apples is not normal
what
12after much resistence
I tried
12thinking it's going to be a horrble deck and it's not worth my time
12i built eeveelutions XD
I'm not in the mood right now
02Guesst WILL Live
I'm getting paranoid about everything again
02:o
02What are you paranoid about?
I get paranoid whenever I'm stressed
12now you know
12get the plate if it EVER happens again >_>
And nearly getting struck in the head by a 70 mph speeding apple counts as stress
TWICE
in different spots
12was it a whole apple?
12or a core?
yep
whole thing
02Whole...
12O_O
02Did you go to the hospital?
12then it wasn't an accident -_-
the second time I fell off my bike, scraped my knee and was so afraid that I asked a friendly stranger to help escourt me home
He was kind enough to do so
it a Draje
02Well, luckily you wern't severly injured
Afterwords, I cleaned up my knee, patched myself up and turned on my laptop to tell someone
12:/
you guys happened to be the closest people since my friends are busy and another group is running a charity
12how about your parents?
02Did you tell them?
I did tell them

they said I would be fine

12how fun do you think guitar hero would be, if it had no music
Hi hi ^^
Hey Proto
12lolz
Hi.
Well it's just a rythum game like DDR
those games need gimmics
02It would be better without the music
12XD
02So all you did was press randombuttons
It would be more competitive, that's for sure
Hello people
12you just sit there holding a guitar doing nothing else saying "i'm i done yet?"
02Hi Kredit
12am i*
02I saw big peaches in the beginning of the game, and the 52IN TV and upconversion to 720P made them look even better
/me runs
Blah... went to Fallsview Casino today (on account of getting into the $20.01 buffet for $12 bus fare.
Their food is ungood, my stomach feels rather bleg.
02Let's just hope you're not posioned
If I was... yay free PAC points.
12o.o
/me calls Pac-Man?
(Which means jack nothing since I have a grand total of... 7 PAC points. :P
/me hideshotdies
PAC = 04Player's 04Advantage 04Club.
Thanks for standing still, wanker
12D:
/me hides
I have however discovered the way to get lots of "free" PAC points.
Although to do so does, in the long run, lose money. And takes roughly a bloody day. :P
02XD
25 cent roulette + bet on red and black + keep hitting the "Spin/Rebet" button.
You will - on most spins - neither win nor lose anything.
(Duh... you lose one of the bets, with the other bet, which pays back itself and the other bet.)
Keep doing that and you'll eventually end up racking up the PAC points, becuase, each spin loses you 25 cents, and you get a PAC point every 40 dollars (and since you win back that 25 cents, you're essentially losing nothing).
Except on 0.
Then you lose fifty cents outright. :P
12what color would you call cynder
12dark purple
12violet?

12ok
6*fangirlism*
04hi Quan
6Hey, Lyon.
6'sup?
(Also, as an aside on that "free PAC point method"... in the 160 spins of the wheel you need, to get the $40.00; you - if the wheel acted "perfect" would zero out a total of 4 times. So, you get 1 PAC point - which costs $40.00 - for a grand total price of $2.00; which is not bad, eh?)
04nothing much, you?
6Well, fangirlism. :P
04over whom this time?
6Going through the third season of you-know-what.
12XD
6And screenshotting each time Kazunori(?) makes the animation.

02hey, sky may i ask you something?
10Sure
02Who started the FLOOF fad?
02http://i55.tinypic.com/6tjyao.jpg
04...
04lol
02Deal with it
10Well
/me sunglasses
10it dates back to even before I was on TST
04that is ANCIENT times
10I'm not sure who started it
/me hides
10might've been Kyu, dunno
02xeli may know...
02Still a stupid fad
It started in ancient times
02With the romans?
In the ancient years of the early 2000's, I think'
10Xeli is only a month older than me (TST registration date-wise) @Ray
02o.o
10So I doubt he'd know any different
02so Drf ma-- no i don't think that he cares erm... arti?
02Err, still on vacatio n
I'm gonna reheat some dinner, brb
10That's the thing, no one here started 'floof'
10Seeing as it's a real definition
03sorry my IRL friend is here so I'm gonna be idle
12rawr
02ok
12ok
02wait, how can a Umbreon Rawr?
10It was merely brought here by an unidentified person at the moment
12i can
kk
/me can make almost every sound ever made
02!umbreon
02:\ so, the origin of FLOOF is unknow?
12it is my understanding
10Pretty much
10most creators remain anonymous
02hmm.. well that anonymous creator, earned my ethernal respect... he started a great fad :3
02I think it's stupid now
10It's not any different than to be fluffy, so eh
02Must of been the vodka in my torillni....
02lol HML, that's one person who says that vs almost all TST
02Or was it the vodka in the sauce...
02Oh well, I'll like it in the morning
02XD
10You drink vodka, HML? o.o
02No..
10Ok, just checking
:O
02I saw VODKA in the recipie for the sauce I "drank" tonight
02o.o
02It was delicous
10Did it say how much?
02BRB, i'll check the list!
12doesn't matter
12the sauce was probably boiled\
12which evaporates all the alcohol
10True, but I'm curious
Uh oh
02The recipie was tripled
we're all doomed
02So it's now 3 cups of Vodka
mwahahahahahaha
and i'm installing nikki as my empress
10Heh
can I be the jester?
02I wondered why it tasted weird...
you can be the imperial plumber :P
02They said it was the spices/ pepper

LMFAO DARCHOODS
THIS JUST MADE MY HOUR
...
BECAUSE MY DAY HAS ALREADY BEEN GREAT BUT THIS MADE IT GREATER
what about darchoods?
http://www.owlpages.info/fantasy/viewtopic.php?p=122333#122333
BATTLE OF DARCHOODS...:D
...XDD
:D
or are they trollin'?
if they are then you're trollin' trolls
which is supposedly impossible
well that is cool man i dont want to bother you.
I have acheived the impossible!
*achieved
And WTF
why have they not activated my account yet??
Can it really take /that/ much time?
I pmed the admin asking him what's up
just now
ok ok no need to become hostile here. :s
...what just happened?
My computer screen blanked out and then came back on 5 times brighter than before
O.o
Hostile is fun
graphics card updating?
lol
maybe
yeah right
:P
not likeyl, I know
well if you say so human.
*likely
Hehe human huh?
I used to think SR knew what he was talking about and just believed whatever he said about computers without question
But I really don't think that's what's going on here. =/
:P
I'm no SR
when I say stuff like that, I'm just speculating
Oh, I thought you were referencing that one time he said that
also when I said updating, I meant it was switching from the weaker one to the brighter one like it sometimes does
....OK, and now it's back to normal
not outright patching itself
My computer is weird
though awesome
it's probably just becoming self-aware and trying to mess with me
D:
nothing to worry about
what do you mean "nothing to worry about"?
/me 12licks his dragoness
12Come now... we have important stuff to do.
XD
that';s a whole lot to worry about
xP
Sorry, we do
12Hehe ^.=.^
ksdjflsdjflasjdfadfs
oh i understand ok goodbye
I just tried re-registering and it says my username has been taken
with the same username as last time you tried?
Yeah, it's taken, by me the first time I tried to register. -.-
4>)
12>;P
Oh well
lazy admin maybe?
seems that way
I have, but he hasn't been online since then
niiiight all ^-^
night
im so happy cuz imma gummy bear gummy bear!!!
.....
12FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUu
/me is sick of lazy admins and hopes the admin of this site isn't one <.<
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
would you say this guy's lazy?
I think she's afk
yeah
well
I can assume from what we have seen that either
a) it's a lazy admin
or b) the site's new member system sucks and it didn't go through
which still implies lazy admin
YUP!
true
because you think they'd have figured it out by now and fixed it
since the site's been around since 2004
/me 12shoots himself
So much for not wasting time on assholes like us
yup u talked 2 me first so ha!!! :P
I'm hoping it's just that they haven't been on the computer today
yeah
but that can't be, because why did yours go through then?
BITCH!!!
I registered before you
Run like the little scared insect you are
maybe he came on but didn't have much time, and mine was the most recent request so he just got it out of the way quick
wich means lazy admin
*which
sorry going back and forth between computer and the house
only half the members end up getting accepted, I'm not sure why.
deane isn't very lazy though whenever I email him I get a reply within 15 minutes
I'll bring it up in the Mod Forum.
k I made a post in there, hopefully I'll get a reply back soon.
nini
that is really weird
if a lot of people have that problem the forum might have double the members it does now
well I remember back in 07 when my cousin was registering it took him 2 times
yeahh
I think deane has the mod forum on alert and he's always around so hopefully he'll reply back in a bit
hopefully he can get this figured out
Meow
no battle of Darchoods reuniun is complete without our commanding officer
:P
*reunion
Reonion
ReOnion
an old onion that has been reborn
http://www.youtube.com/user/jacksfilms#p/u/10/thXrVlRORM4
/me actually read the word "union" as "onion" out loud once
haha, nice
so basically we dont like her
:P
lol
she a member there?
yep
I'm bored so I'll blab about all the members
:P
AND SHE'S 20!
:P
ancientwinds is a n00b that tries too hard to not be optimistic, hate on everything that is happy, and expects all of the members to be excited and/or know about some book she's writing, but like all 12 year olds that "are writing a book" she's never ACTUALLY gonna finish.
and yeah sooty uses her age a lot to prove her points even though she's not really 20
I am totally right because I'm 20]
exactly.
you know what'd be funny?
04hi
if she had been a member for four years and all four year's she's "been 20 years old"
*years
LMFAO no she joined in like 08 I think and she said she was "18" then
ah
:P
what word does koj use?
p u s s y
:P
ah
ffffffffffffffff let's see who are some other active members...
theowlette is the other active moderator, and owlpages/deane is the admin
the old mods that aren't with us on there anymore are High tyto soren, twilight and adain
wow, a lot of people have GoG names
well, I guess it is a fanpage, but still :P
....duh
:P
02Going out for a performance so bbl
what about all the people with "cynder" in their name on spyroforum
oh true
lol
same deal
Cynder28397e29
Did you know my SF username was gonna be Cynder666
ahahahaha
minus the e, I'll bet that's a real name
*Cyndork

After watching these two videos, if you still love meat you are less than an organism.
/me hides
10I'm not a big meat person, tbh
I used to love meat
10McDonald's ruined hamburgers for me
But after seeing a roadshow where they showed how today's chickens grow unnaturally fast, I swore off it
Then, that.
Also, that
10I haven't eaten that crap for many years
10The stuff they put in the food is horrid, not to mention the food in general tastes appalling
I hardly step into a fast food establishment nowadays
Skylands: Opinion
Sorry, but it's like a pet peeve of mine when people make it seem like they take it for granted that their opinion is the only right one xD
10But that's what I was doing lol
The stuff they put in the food is horrid, not to mention the food in general tastes appalling
/me doesn't see anyone going against her opinion at the moment anyway
but okay, just shows how much of a pet peeve of sorts it is to me xD
and I don't mind McDonalds at all, nothing more nor less so

So might not reply
I will see how far I can go
I do still occasionally visit some
Mos Burger has a Potato Patty burger which I can eat
Then again, as I said, not often
Their items are usually more expensive than food I can get elsewhere

Quick question...I'm out of work...should I wait until I find something I like or take a job I hate because I need the money to pay my bills?
I think the latter is best for now
02Hi
02<<
07I agree with you
07Besides
07Work experience.
Yeah just I end up either quitting or worse in those types of jobs
I'll just have to keep saying to myself it's for the money and I can find something better later lol
07Yeh.
07Honestly
I've got 4 years of work experience. I would go to uni but I can't pay the rent and bills with nothing
07Work fails like that I've noticed. And yeh...
yeah, I never should have left my good job but I needed to move up here to be with Burnett, and I don't regret that at all
07thing is if you're away from work too long people might be all 'and why weren't you working during that time' z.z and indeed.
I just wish I'd saved up a heck of a lot more
07I never said you did regret the move either
I always put on my CV 'looking for work which takes a lot of time'
I know :)
/me nods ^^
07I'm so proud of you RN.
07No seriously, your dedication to finding work and such.
I'm not going to volunteer because it means working for nothing and less time to look for work....I would volunteer if I had a job and spare time though. And thanks but I've been feeling really down being out of work again.
02Well, good luck with you temp job
/me nods.
07RN I'm still proud of you though, even though it seems really difficult for ya.
07I can't say I've ever experienced the same but honestly, yeh.
07Redundancies?
07can you explain?=
I left college early because I was sick of never having any money...don't follow my example xD as I ended up in a poorly paid job and still no money. But a few years later I was in very good jobs.
Yeah every law firm I have worked in has laid people off because they're in financial difficulty...like the one I had just now.
I left some of the law firms though to move.
Anyway I'm not whining :) I won't talk about jobs much more today haha
07Back
07Just uploaded some photos on facebook x3;
07*;>
07but yeah. Good luck.
Yeah I just thought I was, lol.
02XD
07How is life with Burnett?
02Perserver mah Ninetails, and yoou will have success
It's good thanks ^^
Got to go for a bit, back later!
02bye
07Hm
07Its so quiet here LOL
02It appears to be DEAD again!

Yeah, haha. Hey.
02Apple did a good thing?
Apparently
See
You can download .pdf files
Free
Hahaha
Off the internet
XD
But
/me wonders if they're /still/ actually buying this
Since I respect Rick Riordan
I'll buy all his other books
02:3
AncientWinds posted the EXACT same greeting to you as she did to me
I just CAN'T FIND this ONE book!
typos and all
So I'll "rent" it |P
/me flees
Hahahahaha
But we've gone all out with the fantasy, so I doubt any of dim enough to believe now.
nn -_-
a war that ended years before any of us were born
*are dim
Yeah, XD
The same exact post, basically.
And the war of Darchoods and purple dragons
I corrected her spelling of liar.
XD yeah
if anyone asks
I wasn't even trying to troll I thought it was so obviously a joke
the Purple Dragons were our code name for the Viet Cong :P
It is.
Not our fault for being fooled.
*them being fooled
lol yeah
we were clearly joking
Dude
*belch*
Yes?
you completed my LOTR quote
I cannot believe it
02XD

Well, the part before it anyway.

Hullo, Sir Ray.
/me nods.
I've evolved into a jerk.
Haha
nice
and a mod oddly enough
It goes hadn in hand.
*hand

AW is so irritating.
I feel the need to smite her.
Although she does say "WOT" a lot, ironically.
haha
I hate aw shes a dumb [censored] I think I'll take her precious [censored]ing book and shove it up her [censored]ing ass
just
[censored]
[censored] her
I'm just going to respond with Captain soon.
And she's 12.

she's a dumb[censored]
Too young for me.
xD
ah.
not in a laughing mood sorry.
Nah.
But she's done nothing wrong, technically.
she still irritates the [censored] out of me
Can't even muscle my way in with bias to get her in trouble.
Burpy kippeh

I'm not sure of its origin, but it's noice.
Lolwow
My friend rubbed off Caps Lock from his keyboard and wrote Billy Mays in its place.
Apple made a brightness slider for iBooks
hahaha
02Sounds like a 3D slider
But they prevent other apps from modifying brightness
SO USEFUL >_>

No it doesn't
02Oh well, a slider is a slider
Well, I have to retire for the night.

02MMhmm
12Gradius III
12I have NEVER beaten that o-o;
02Good! I can't get past the 3rd level
LL~
/me has so far gotten to the 5th
12Chime~
12Hyper
12the 4th is all Faces o3o
12the fifth is literally Hell
12Michigan
/me shot
02Fire?
02XD
12anyway-yah
12and the boss is Twin Fire Dragons >_<
02Gawd...
12btw
02Now I'll never beat it
12Kirby Epic Yarn~
/me got it today o3o
02Is it really Epic?
12it's rather fun ^^
12but
12blah
12it's SO different from ANY previous Kirby titles .-.
02Just like Canvas Curse
12never played it
12o.o
02But everybody liked it in the end
12I still think the best one is Kirby 64
12then Super Star (and Ultra) closely behind
02But Adventure was the best
12never played it o3o
02It looked AMAZING on the NES
/me shrugs
12did he have the copy ability?

/me <3 Kirby 64 anyway
02Kirby 64 was good, but I can't seem to defeat the final boss (pre-all shards one)
12ah yes
12Miracle Matter
12the only thorn in that game >_<
02I nearly beat it once...
/me lols
12I've tried
12and have NEVER beaten Boss Battles in K64
12because of HR-E and Miracle Matter...
02LOL I think they're easy
12they are
02HR-E, that robot in the ice factory
/me nods
12HR-E is the one that chases you
02Best boss in the game
12once I get to 02, then I know I win
12huh o.o
/me disagrees o3o
02Other than the first 3
1202 takes the top spot for overall perfection
12best music, mood, atmosphere, fight, etc.
12but since you haven't fought it yet...nvm ^^;
12the first 5 bosses...
/me hmms
12Whispy Woods: enjoyable. Pix: annoying
12Acro: annoying but fun
12Magman: fun
02I thought the acro was cool, but the last seqence was annyoing
02Same
12HR-H/HR-E: not bad, but a little long
Criticizing Kirby 64 now?
12Hyper
02Yup
12easy to K-O Acro:
12suck up one of the arrow fish and hold it above your head
I haven't played it in ages so I wouldn't be able to pass fair judgment
12it keeps shooting arrows
I need another vacation
12I can USUALLY get past the first 4 bosses without damage in Boss Battles
12but HR-E and Miracle Matter...
12and Guesst, what brought this up
02Magman was the hardest for me, other than MM
12is that I have nao played Epic Yarn o3o
12really?
02Kept falling
I personally haven't played it yet
12I take a point on him at worst
I'd rather rent the game
12and blah
$50 for the whole thing?
12now I want to try K64's Boss Battles again >_<;
02Ehh...
02So do I
Same with DKC returns
/me o-o
/me hopes thats good...
I do too
12but I'll be enjoying Portal 2 ^^
02Some Wii games are 70-75$ here
12WAT
02WHAT?
I need to move my wii into my room
But that would just Make me lazy
Won't we all
And coop
/me has never seen a Wii game(by itself) over 50 o-o
Wut?
12ah
Highway robbery!
02Nah..
02The wii's are about 325-350$ here
12anyway
So do you guys get paid in gold for that stuff pr something?
12the only reason I got Epic Yarn on the release date
Or*
12is because of a deal from work ^^
02Just the shipping and taxes raise it up
12buy Epic Yarn, you get $20 off Metroid Other M
02Remeber Him?
02Samus Does
12and then the Employee Discount takes 10% off that
12hmm?
02Lucky
Indie game store?
Remember me?
Yep
12and THEN I got another coupon for 20% off ANY game purchase o3o
So where is it that you work that does that? Gamestop or a local place?
12err
Or a retail store
12*$20
Oh yeah
Best buy
12Kmart
Same thing :p
/me eyes Dead Rising 2...
02I got my Wii (in 2007) on sale
12nice :o
I need to get away from my pc
12lolz
02Why?
02Stay with us Forever
02FOREVER AND EVER
/me shot
Because it's taking my attention away from other games
12this is how I'm going to be the next few weeks/months:
12<random>
All I've been playing lately is super scribblenauts, tf2 and l4d2
02I use my laptop, so it doesn't matter
I want to stop playing tf2 for awhile, but trading
Oh the trading
12finish BS2>play then finish Okami>play then finish Other M> play then finish Epic Yarn(with Co-Op)>buy, play, then finish Dead Rising 2
The trading that tripled my hat count
1210% of 40 is...
That's a good plan, LL
124
12so I'll get DR2 for $36 o3o
02Only 36$
02Nice price
/me nods
12I have to wait till the coupon activates in a few days
12but w/e
I still need to finish castlvania rebirth, Phoenix Wright, and blaster master overdrive
I have no time to
Too much pc gaming
I should move my laptop into my room where my wii is or something
Not my room
02Continue Okami< finsh SMG2< Start Muramasa< Get Get another game
More like the dining room
Good luck with the second one
02just to finsih the first final boss
02I never aim for 1000%

02SSShh, it's a good game!
12yes
I stopped at the first
Yes it is
12but the last 120 are RIDICULOUS!
02I paused at the 67th
I mean, why?
Why would you do it again
/me dresses the Green Stars up in red and white stripes with a matching hat
12Where's Waldo: SMG edition
/me flees
HATSHATSHATS!

12Other M
02THERES THE OTHJER M!
12I got it for a discount
12but eh

12not really looking forward to it
It's too new school for me
12I've heard it's not as good
Can you give it to me?
:3
12as the Prime 4
12no XD
02?.?
12meaning Metroid Prime 1-3 and Hunters
02I perfer the first prime ( NEED TO FINSIH)
It reeks of easy modern game
02Too many unfinished games...
12XD Hyper
12here's a spoiler |3
I beat them all in the collectors disk
02Almost done anyway
12Prime 1: not too hard but the final boss is NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE
And no spoilers
Eh
Final boss was easy
12Prime 2: VERY DIFFICULT, but the final bosses are easy
Took 3 tries
But still easy
12took me like: 7 >_<
Prime 2 is evil
02At the Phazon place, can't beat the Prime Pirates
12XD Guesst
12no
02I was stuck after the first 2 hrs
yes
12the Boost Ball Guardian is evil >_<
02YESH
The original one is evil
12NO SAFE ZONES in a MINI BOSS FIGHT o3o
They made everything easier in the wiiboot
12lolz
I mean, why? I love a challenge
02I have to deal with the GC versions
That's hy I'm a gamer
And that's why your life sucks
12btw
12Metroid 1
12is
Live with it
12OMGHARD
02I'm only a gamer for teh lulz
I beat 1
...
12O_O
With narpas sword
:p
02Never going to try to beat it
12I beat Zero Mission, which is technically beating 1...
I think I really did beat it, though
12and Fusion is <3
12ohai drf
When I as like, 11 or something
02Hmm...
12lolz
I really want to play fusion
12Guesst
12at first
12before I got Zero Mission
I played a store demo
12I was actually DRAWING A MAP
And wanted it ever since
12of the first Metroid XD
/me nods
/me isn't kidding o-o
As many did
In the 80s, maps and passwords on paper were common
02Same with my SNES games
12lolz
They made gaming extend outward
12Super Metroid was excellent~
02All those darn MMX passwords
Anyone remember the startropics letter?
12no
12and D:
12dun change the topic D:
02Dun dun dun
Too bad this is cool
12>3<;
12but Samus is the first lady of gaming!
12so she's cooler! D:<
02ORLY?
It was a letter that came in the instructions that you had to put in water to reveal a code on order to progress in the game.
12YARLY
12wait
12what
02Wow
There, now we can get back on topic
And by we I mean I
12lolz
/me still hasn't finished Metroid 2
12also confuzzling
I did
Just a year ago
12maybe it's the lack of map in the first 2...
02I haven't finsihed a single metroid game yet
It's short
12lolz
12still
/me ASDF
02Never plan to
02fds
But it's large for a gameboy game
12I haven't beaten Hunters >_<;

99.999% of the time
02My 7 came "free" with my PC
02Since XP was already on it
03my laptop came with Vistrash
:q
02Ewww
Then I shall patiently for that .001%
There's a four and a half hour long version of hamlet that has every line in it.
03my desktop, since I built it myself, came with nothing.
03actually, technically, I paid for Vista.
03because this was custom too
Oh god no
Not that sort of movie.
Hehe.
03the guy was like "If you're gonna wait for Windows 7 I can just not give you an OS, but if you pay for Vista you get a
I know what you mean. ;D
03free upgrade to 7"
03so i was like OK why not
I prefer it to be done and gone in an hour and a half to two hours.
:o
03but then I ended up discovering MSDNAA and not needing the upgrade one
...
D:!
:3
You're mean
I'm telling Ari next time he's around here!
:o
D:
:O
He's being mean to me. ._.
Awww, there there
:3
</late>
02So you're keepin the upgrade one for later?
:O
02SELL IT FOR 100$
Bullies are just mean because they don't have self-esteem or something like that
Proto foiled my plans!
>:O
I saw that on a culturally relevant sitcom so it has to be true
:3
03LOL
Haha
02YOU MAKE PPPRROFIT
/me prods where's supposed lack of self-esteem.
03Dude, you can buy your own Home Premium upgrade for only slightly more
/me curls up in a ball crying
;-
;-;
/me counter-bullies where.
02But it has XP mode!
:O

02But it's still fun to play with
/me büllïës Strÿkër ïn thë fäcë

/me curls up and just dies, instead.
/me obliterates where.

02-Random- My Vista PC gets a BSOD everytime it shuts down, so we never shut it down, since it'll stay on unless somebody waits 2 mins until they can
/me liquifies away
:o
:3
/me wins.
/me dribbles away and congeals
/me declares a 360 win over the lowly PC gamer.

That sort of behaviour is what I'd expect of a console gamer.
:D
:|
Okay, fine.

/me thinks you are silly and smell bad
:3
You're the one who went all "IdunwannafriendhernomoarcuzsheplayconsolesD:!"

After all, when have I said we're friends? :3
._.
/me cries.

/me was only joking about that last bit D:
/me kicks where in the shin for being mean
Dx
/me hides behind Proto, 'cuz he's nice to her.

hey Ari, hi Lu ^^
07Heya
Hai, Curly! :3
so I had this horrible dream :(
D:
my roommate and I were in the army or something
and we were there with like 100 other men all in a big grassy park type thing
and we were setting up camp or something
>.<
and all I really remember was when the plane was coming
and there was a little bomb and we were all running for cover
hoi burd :D
and we started heading for the one really tall tree
and then I hit the deck and felt this blast wave
and I looked back and my friend's leg was gone and his guts were all over
it was soooo gorey
gory
>.<
anyhow, thought I'd share that
I also had a dream!
07^v^
I don't remember it though, but I am sure it somehow involved setting the world on fire ^^
with matches?
No. D:
Oh! I just remembered, as he laid there dying, he told me, "I'm going to hell"
and then I kept reassuring him he was a good person and that
God would forgive him etc

/me reminded of the time she accidentally swore >_<;
/me is thoroughly amused
12it was to my sister .-.

07Yeah
07Sometimes
07UK/US conversions
07are a bit weird
Fanny honestly doesn't have a place at all in my mental dictionary :P
6I wonder if the english language took these words from you for this exact reason
07Espeon, fanny to me sounds sorta... posh
07XD
07but yeah
07Aurora, english is SUCH a weird language

oO
07so when Arrow said that to us
07Mum thought he swore at us XD
6I was about to say "people who speak chinese don't say that though"
Whuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut.
07we then procceeded to laugh our tail off 8D

When they do, it knocks them out and rifles throught heir pockets looking for spare vocabulary.

patio?

Farewell, Sky Templars~
07Byes!
or at least
that's what I call a patio xD
mhm
/me looked up patio on wikipedia and is a bit confused now
A patio is like a raised flat paved area, isn't it?
/me has to go to speak to the freshmen now
that's what I thought
I'll bbl :3
according to Wikipedia a patio is like a backyard though...
bye Ari o/
byeee o/
so it's a paved area used for dining
I always called patios the balcony type thing at the back of a house >.>
isn't that a porch?
or a veranda
is it? I thought porches were lower down and were made for like benches and stuff
a veranda is like a ground floor balcony type thing
Curly: you've made me confused too.. <.<
yeah, I was right, a porch is at the front of the house
:S
so whats a patio?
a paved area used for dining
http://www.schaeferfan.com/images/ZC-Z12-horiz.patio.w.jpg
without a roof
isn't that a patio?
i don't think it is
Silly crashes D:
what is it then? O_o
a deck?

/me is pretty sure people call decks patios too though... >.>
I think the main difference is that patios have stone floor, and decks have wooden floor
and decks are usually raised off the ground
yes
D: People still refuse to tell me what I missed :(
you didn't miss much
If I had a mansion, I would want the middle to be a greenhouse practically D:
just us talking about patios/decks/porches >.>
That'd be awesomeish ^^
why the middle? O:
So I could have an oak in the middle of the house
I don't think oaks need to grow in a greenhouse >.>
12blah
12g2g v-v
12BBL tonight~
/me is pretty sure a greenhouse would be too hot for an oak tree
Myes, but I would like it to be warm there year-around D:
07Espeon
07so like
07My classnmate used
07the computer
07to log into the school website
put a big sauna somewhere in your house then O:
07he accidentally wrote his password into the username field
07and it autosaved
07LOL
07so now I know his password z.z
or a steam room if you want it humid
07its very random LOL!
/me practically just meant a garden with a roof on it :3
oh
nevermind me then >.>;
Glass roof of course :o
lol o.o
Air conditioning would be required in the winter and the summer D:
/me is eating popcorn.
/me knows he will pay for it later with gas.
Or I would just not need a roof if it was in somewhere like California or sumtin warm like that.
07yeah
07LOL
is it sunny where you live a lot of the time?
Yeah
And windy enough for the forest to keep losing trees.
okays, I was just wondering, because a glass roof would get really cold if there wasn't sunlight >.>
I was mostly just being sillyish though :3
~
13A bloody spider just scared me half to death >_>
Plus, we need to heat our buildings pretty much year-around anyways, so if I would be able to afford a building like that, I could probably afford heating it D:
lol you and the
spiders
13I've seen way too many of them recently e.o
:<
dari is that beautiful tranny quote still on your chat from last night
13This one came running towards me from under one of the cupboards in the kitchen whilst I was washing my plate, so I screamed and left the room
Yes.
13Refused to go back and clean my plate until I knew it was gone =<
o-o
yes
:'D
well, it's gone for now it seems
6looool

12i've been sick so blah
07also
07Umbreon
07Yes
07what is terminal velocity
12it sounds... familiar
!define terminal velocity
12lol no tst bot?
12the constant maximum velocity reached by a body falling through the atmosphere under the attraction of gravity
07which means?
12velocity.... hmm
12i believe is speed
03I totally just woke up
12drf is an expert ask him
/me 6explodes
/me cleans up the pieces
Asploding Roara
6!espeon !umbreon
/me now belongs to Aurora for 20 minutes
Watch out for flying floof
12eep
12noooo
And um
Terminal Velocity
13Isn't terminal velocity something like the maximum speed that something reaches when it's falling, when the kinetic energy converts into sound and heat energy?
03Aurora/Chimever, whoever
13or am I thinking of something else
That's like, the maximum speed of an object when falling
It won't get any faster
Actually it's not really speed
Velocity is like, speed x distance...?
Also drf
You
Are
Awesome

LOL on facebook "Anyone know a very easy pumpkin pie recipe?" Me: "Yeah, buy it from the shop"
6OMG PUMPKIN PIE
6I looooove it
I've never had it
the pumpkins are too hard to dig out and carve
6well
6I buy them from the market too
6so
6|D
6my friend and I bought a full one last year and split it between us
6best pie ever, gonna go back to that store this year
nice! I've never tasted it, I'll have to some time
6I was so full after though ._.
I was always told by people that pumpkin pie doesn't taste of anything, strange
6...nah, it definitely has a taste
6and it's sooo goood
03back
03also LOL
03this reminds me of
03a few years ago
03my mom had heard from a few people that Meijer had the best pumpkin pies ever, better than home made ones
03(Meijer is a local superstore chain)
I'll have to try it - I can't cook much so I'll see if they sell good ones at the shops.
03so she bought one, and she made one herself, then didn't tell us which is which
03and we had a slice of each
03and we all basically said we liked the Meijer one better than hers XD
Meow
haha
6lol
See I'd look which one she handled carefully, that's the homemade one xD people always do that
cos they know theirs might break into bits
Wow drf
rawr
meow
mrawawr
oh Ari, did you hear? I found a skelespider in minecraft O:

I just decided spider mounted skeletons was too annoying to say so I stuck with skelespiders :O

I love pizza :3
I'm not much of a fan of sweet things
In regards to food
/me pours a pound of sugar into a jar of molasses and passes it to Curly.
O:
thinking about making one in a little bit if I don't fall asleep from exhaustion first
molasses is chewy?
I thought molasses was like honey
thick and goopy
little thicker
I figured by being really thick it would be inherently chewy.
if it doesn't stick in your teeth it's not chewy :O
try shoe fly pie sometime
wanna talk about thick and kinda chewy
/me mixes in some taffy then! D:<
that would work ^^

This book series
<33333
Rick Riordan deserves £5,000,000,000,000,000
RP :D
07Heya ^v^
5Rick /who/?
07Articuno!!!!!!!!!!!!
02Astley
Author of Percy Jackson
Riordan
5Oheh.
5He's probably a rich man already, lol.
Yep
A genius at that
o.o
/me noms
5Underrated authors like Diane Duane and Amelia Atwater-Rhodes and Peter David need more love. D:
5Because they're all SO GOOD.
:<
5..And the last one in that list wrote a parody of Twilight with his daughter:
5POTATO MOON
/me 5fleeeeeeeeeeeeee!!
LOL
Name some of their books?
Didn't Diane Duane write /a lot/ of of the better Star Trek novels?
Mewmew
5Uh, yes, YES SHE DID. <3
5And so did Peter David. /fleeee!!
5But he also wrote a whole bunch of amazing fantasy novels.
5And I loved Duane's Young Wizards series when I was young.
\o/
Heh
5http://www.peterdavid.net/index.php/2009/04/24/potato-moon-part-1-by-ariel-david-and-her-dad/#more-2615 <--- I lol'd.
I should read some of her books
And x3
I know P. David wrote a bunch of the 'Trek novels.
5THEY'RE REALLY GOOD.
5Ahhh I can't get over how much I love David. I mean his books are just OMG.
Didn't both collaborate on that "Starfleet: Year 1" serial novel? (Or whatever it was called,)
(With a few of the other "big name" 'Trek authors.
5"...“Great,” he thought aloud, “there must be something deeply symbolic with me taking a bite out of a potato that looks like Bela.” He threw the potato behind him. A crash resounded resoundingly as the potato shattered the window. ..." LOL.
WTF LOL
Okay, now that's funny. :P
5I never really read the Starfleet novels...
I'll read that later
XD
5That's actually kind of how she writes. Minus the amusing dialogue.
Heh
02Twilight is silly
Amusing dialogue ftw tho :<
5Tootally.
02Creepy stalker vampires are nto
/me is making book
I hope it'll be as good as PJ :E
But of course
5Chime, have you ever read Dan Bergstein's awesomeness, "Blogging Twilight"?
02How big is it>
That can't happen
:<
no
Sounds interesting tho
5You should. It is SO FUNNY.
5I'll link you to it.
5http://community.sparknotes.com/index.php/2009/07/16/blogging-twilight-index-page/
I've found something funny.
If you dramatically read a technical manual to a Twilight fan... they won't know the difference from their bland drivel of a book. :P
5Lol, true that.
02XD
:3
/me coughs
heh
no D:
/me likes it in here
But I can't hug you like that :x
oh yeah :o
:D hi where!
Hi, where!

/me will take it
Howdo you DRAMATICALLY read a tech manual?
Yay!
02You be ME
02I read manuals Dramaticlly
^-^
Hi!
/me is ask
Er
afk
<.<
03brb/bbl putting my TV tuner back in my PC
02I wonder if I could hook my GC or SNES to that
Heya there. (=
hi :D
that was very late D:
What was very late? D:
:D
Oh, that.
it's ok Cat :p.
Cat, do you have an awesome idea for on what day to make regular blog posts? ^^
every wednesday
I have about 30 interiors to bloggify
Okies!
:D
30?
I meant 60 D.
Thewhat
What order to use? :o
From newest to oldest?
07fff
oldest first
D:
But that would cut in to the flow :o
huh?
12Who, the guy with the twitchy ear? Nope! I was just thinking... You're really good friends!
12ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
12Why don't you love me Yun whyyyyy
12;v;
02What?
12VDex.
02Fangirls....
I already have 5 posts, it would be easier to flow backwards from the first one that I did post.
12:|
12I'm trying to max him out to get Mewtwo.
but beginning at the oldest ones gives a background to build from, and then you can explain design decisions that were based on earlier posts
plus, they would appear to be evolving as you kept on blogging
But they are all unrelated to eachother :o
but your mind was the link all along
But, I suppose I can start from the beginning and such.
on
Not really, it is seriously inconsistent.
But I suppose the interiors that were made before I lost my mind might have slight relations...
huh.. well I have no idea what you're talking about, so why not do themes instead?
like, this week is "purple" day
or some such things
are you like, an architect?
Modder
oh cool
/me is paralyzed
I am using the Elder Scrolls Construction Set, if that is what you mean :p
I only mod this one silly game :3
yeah. you are the one I remember in #tamriel
02Evil leg cramp...

12I could've said it a lot harsher.
o-o
7Or frank.
I have some wensleydale cheese, and am considering eating some :O
dude, Lu..you are missing out.
7Harsh does not have to equal mean.
/me sneezes
yeah, I wonder if maybe there are different kinds of onions with dramatically different flavors too,.
there are a couple
not alot, alot.
purple onions i can handle.
dang, I'll never get to be a good cook at this rate T_T
heh
Cooking is for boobed ones!
curry powder improves a lot of thing
*things
/me is being silly of course.
/me cries and cries and cries, and wonders where all these onions came from
10TR, what's with all the clones?
Cat, curry is a mixture of like 100 spices isn't it?
Idk
<______<
Cat, I'm thinking there are numerous variety of said powder in powdered form
I exit out for one sec
I can't make pancakes, but I can make some mean chicken and rice >:3
I have a thing of hot curry powder next to me
and now there is reeds everywhere!

I'm guessing a lot
02WB DRF
What'll do? D:
/me hugs back.
10Exit out, what do you mean exactly?
Coriander, cumin seed, ginger, salt, fenugreek, garlic powder, chilli powder, cinnamon, pepper, paprika, bay leaf, cardamom and caraway seed

minimize
I need to find the lyrics to this songthing that I do not particullary like, but keeps being played on this radio station :/

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry_powder
10Probably

At night
While cycling
At different spots 2 times
12What.
12:O
12Attacked by Apple?
12Ovo?
/me can't tell if we are being serious or not
Blocks away from each other where you would have to wait for a specific person to ride by to tell if it was them
It was the stalking that scared me
I scraped my knee and broke my chain while in a panic.
12I don't even get it
12I'm lost..
12^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It would be best if I explained it from the beginning
Brb
02It's okay Arti, only a few know the story
/me 7is curious on what's chatting.
7I'm listening to a soundtrack.
....
/me ...

anybody know how to get rid of the bing bar that came with my mirc?
12in this order: hai, nothing good, and fun ^^;
12and hai Sky and Hyper
02You have to EX-Terminate it
BBS is awesome
02Or just use the right click in IE
how do i do that?
Okay, now that I'm at my keyboard I can better explain these events
12o.o
02He'll explain what you missed LL
how do I EX-Terminate it?
02What broswer are you using?
12IE, why?
02*Chrome, IE or Firefox
02@ TR
Idk how do i find out?
02....................
02Wow...
10o.O
12Chrooooooooooooooooooome.
/me uses Chrome
12...
02FTW
I was riding my usual route to my home after about 1 hour and 30 minutes of biking. All of a sudden an unknown object passed by me and missed me by an inch. I went back to check what it was and it happened to be what I believe was an apple. It was too dark to tell really as I've never been riding this late before.
10When you open your browser, what does the icon say, TR?
12TR
12those are my initials.
/me hurr
10Taylor
/me runs
02Murrherr

3:3
12fu
It doesn't say anything
10Er, how do you get on the Internet, then?
12Is the icon thing a big dumb E thing
12a fox wrapped around a globe
12or something else.
/me is now away - Reason : Auto-Away after 30 minutes
10Lol, dumb E thing
02GAWD.. how hard is it to- Rages

02FAIL'
12download Chrome.
12:OOOOO
02Yup
didnt know that is what you meant
epic fail
so now what?
From there I realized my chain was broken and tried to hide in a ditch where I tried to fix my chain un-noticed . When That failed as I was in a state of shock I flagged down a friendly bystander to help fix it and watch for any more projectiles or the assaulting vehicle.
07Following sample line ended a 6-minute conversation and was followed by 6 minutes of silence:
07O___o lol.. drf
7O3o
12o.o
/me 7blinks at something else entirely.
07that's terrible..
7DAGNABB YOU, DAN GREEN
02Sounds bad huh
dumb bing bar
I managed to get home from there where I then took a shower to wash some of the blood of my knee. Afterwords I was patched up and that knee keeps reminding me of the terror and pain I felt 2 days ago
No I did not
10Personally, I would call the police to scan that area
10Especially if it happens again someday
3E:3
That just added to my weekly regiment of stress and panic which lead to another depression case for the week
its a strange fish
10feesh
10feesh
10FEESH
thoughts of suicide, no desire to work towards goals, forgetfullness... just usual stuff to me

feesh

10Eh, did you tell your parents?

or panic at them

12~Kero Kero Kero Kero Keroro Kero Kero Kero Kero Keroro~
03A blonde walks into a bank in New York City and asks for the Loan officer.
03She says she's going to Europe on business for two weeks and needs to borrow $5,000.
03The bank officer says the bank will need some kind Of security for the loan, so the blonde hands over the keys to a new Mercedes Benz SL 500.
03The car is parked on the street in front of the bank, she has the title and everything checks out. The bank agrees to accept the car collateral for the loan.
03The bank's president and its officers all enjoy a good laugh at The blond for using a $110,000 Benz as collateral against a $5,000 loan.
03An employee of the bank then proceeds to drive the Benz into the bank's underground garage and parks it there. Two weeks later, the blonde returns, repays the $5,000 and the interest, which comes to $15.41.
03The loan officer says, "Miss, we are very happy to have had your business, and this transaction has worked out very nicely, but we are a little puzzled. While you were away, we checked you out and found that you are a multimillionaire.
03What puzzles us is, why would you bother to borrow $5,000?"
03The blonde replies, "Where else in New York City can I park my Car for two weeks for only $15.41 and expect it to be there when I return?"
03Finally... a smart blonde joke.
02LOL

03That's all.
Oh
Wait whay
03Anything you buy on iTunes will be mp4
*what
Last time I checked
5!ew itunes
13EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW ITUNES
03some people think mpeg 4 is more efficiant than mp3
.mp3 files were like
03I honestly don't hear a difference
03and I prefer mp3

03but I don't MIND m4qa

K
What's mpeg layer 3 video, then? o.o
WHAT.
02A 3ds game FTW?
03doesn't exist.

03they skipped right over 3. LOL
PHOENIX WRITE IN A PROF. LAYTON GAME

Hi again all
02Hi RN
hi RN
hay
what's up
/me wonders why she's still CootieMonster
I just saw some trailer for an owl movie. Is it based around a series of books that you've read?
Can't remember what you said they were called.
02BRB Dinner
Legend of the Guardians? yup
I think it just came out in theatres over there, it came out here at the end of september
/me has seen it 3 times so far :D
Lol. Well at least we get HP first. :P
I've never read HP or seen any movies so XD
bye eat well
That's pretty shocking, most people I talk to in the UK have seen all the films and read at least some of the books.
yeah I'm the only person that's never seen or read any of them I bet :P
Don't eat a well, it'll hurt your teeth :/
/me gives the Hungery Lugia a fish
not the only, but you get my point
13and a cookie
and a watermelon
Yeah, I know what you mean. XD
xD
07How are YOU
/me 7needs help. o3o
07Oh telescope?
Help with what?
07and good^^
7File types.
7In the mass of a soundtrack, there's one file which isn't opening properly.
What type is it?
7It's supposed to be an MP3, but..
Sometimes it's a WMA and people have just typed mp3 to the end of it
I've had that problem, but it might not be that.
Curly!
Ari O:
:D
7How do I change the file type?
I usually use a sound file convertor but there may be other ways
03LOL you can't just type something at the end RN
03that doesn't actually work
03What type of file is it Quany?
13actually you can
13like this
03no...
13I like pie.
/me runs
03that doesn't change the filetype
lol ok xD but I have had that problem before where it's been reading as an MP3 file but is actually a WMA file
No I meant people just type it on the end and make other people think it's an MP3 when it isn't
7DRF; it's supposed to be an MP3.
02Back
03but what type is it?
02Thanks for the cookies and watermelons
02And a fish
What I meant is, there's a possibility it's a WMA which someone has just typed .mp3 at the end and people think it's a MP3, not that it changed the file type :) sometimes that has happened to me
7No, I mean, it's an MP3.
wb
7But it's not opening.
03then it's probably corrupted
ok fair enough, different problem to mine then
Hi LL
03or upload it to sendspace and I'll look at it
7How to fix it, then?
03ohai
02WB LL

/me give LLy a gentle hug
13and a cookie
03um.
03The fact that it's 18KB
/me huggles back gently and noms?
03I'm going to take a guess and say that's not a valid file.
03It probably didn't download all the way.
That's like when a torrent that should be 1GB is 18mb and you just know it's a virus or not uploaded properly xD
7Hrm. Let's see, the original file's supposed to be 3.03MB...
7The link given had to be adjusted, as it had one too many spaces...
7And the download itself was cut short. O_o
03gimme the link then
12Liiiiink
7Well, the improper link...
7I'll PM you it.
7Nothing bad, just fangirlistic. Sorta.
I've got to go now guys, bye, hope you get your file sorted, Quan.
7Thanks, RN.

/me 12has a brilliant idea
7Monomer?
!define Monomer
-!- a simple compound whose molecules can join together to form polymers
XD
yay
02Don't forget about this
02I might send you there

oh
well then

7Hydrolysis?
!define saturated fat
-!- Saturated fat is fat that consists of triglycerides containing only saturated fatty acid radicals. There are several kinds of naturally occurring saturated fatty acids, which differ by the number of carbon atoms, ranging from 3 carbons (propionic acid) to 36 (Hexatriacontanoic acid). ...
O_o
!define hydrolysis
-!- a chemical reaction in which water reacts with a compound to produce other compounds; involves the splitting of a bond and the addition of the hydrogen cation and the hydroxide anion from the water

its odd
7Biochemistry?
/me kills her evil Bio teacher
O_o yeah!
!define unsaturated fat

One of the videos I watched had like three pages of comments that were all 'this is a good video'
Haha

Curly, they all had dates of three-four years ago and were ahead of comments from only a few days before.

why would you play valve games on a console in the first place D:
cause you don't have a computer that can do it
well, dumb question, but you get my point >.>
>_<
thats what I was thinking
Valve are releasing on the ps3 again now I think
given I would never waste my money again on a console
they said portal 2 would be on ps3
interesting
I just want the ps3 for console games

/me jots that down too
/me likes peeling off stickers
lol Curly
Cat *
no moar stickers!
:D
wd40 works best Cat
and does not hurt paint
my fingernail did fine
ok :P
also, how many students do you know to have WD40?
well wd40 is for leftovers if there had been
idk I have like 3 cans and a pen
so sue me D:
a pen of wd40?
it might be useful for when I next buy some used cds
because those always have stickers that leave residue
but I can't leave well enough alone D:
02Hi kipi, sorry afk-ness
yes Curly
that must be handy O:
/me finds a creaky door and wd40s it!
and Curly saves the day again
/me closes the curtains

I still want that gigantic computer case with the 10" case fan in the roof >.>
awesomeoppossum
I want a more solid and decent-looking case
mine was fairly cheap D:
I have one Curly :P
O:
BRAWLLL
well its not a full 10 inch
actually, perhaps stick my case under the desk for now
02Oooh
its 240mm I think
that's pretty close
ya
6cm off of a foot :O
yea I like overkill :3
02want*
when I get a computer it's going to be overkill too >.>
I would, lol, but I'm playing Monster Hunter Tri with Shiny right now. Sorry, haha.
then I'm probably going to use it for the next 10 years >.>
02haha XD
I'm a Brawl addict, lol.
I should have got the massive-est cooler when I had the chance
when you * build *
I got the second massive-est D:
not get :P
yes, that's what I mean O:
/me would never buy a computer off the shelf
thank god
I learned how to take computers apart a long time ago, I just haven't been able to put that to any use ):
welcome back Ari ^^
:/
shelf computers are evil abominations D:
yea that sucks Curly
agreed Cat
02*WB03(Feather03)02WB* - <Feather> 10Kiddyland :D
Hey, my computer is a shelf computer :<
and thankfully I know an awesome computer shop
also, I have chocolate swiss rolls :D
02Hi Feather
/me waits...
a computer shop that sold me a 19" LG lcd monitor for only $69 with no tax <3
nice o_O
niice
brb gotta wash my face
incomingggg
02!espeon
I saw my 22" monitor in a high street shop once
02Enemy
I just bought my parents a Dyson vacuum
it was £40 more than I got it for from an online store D:
I want a dyson O:
$400 regularly I got it for $232
high street stores are so not good
with all my discounts ;P
yeah, but online shopping has huge shipping prices for me ):
yea that sucks
brb
don't they do free shipping over a certain price?
02Hi FEAAAAAAAAAATHHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRR
for me it's over £50 with Novatech
which is nice
well
All the things I like cost uber$ to ship. :<
it wasn't with the laptop I was looking at
it was like $100 of shipping -_-
srs? ow
02LOL
that included a bag though
you should see the shipping of *watches* on Ebay to Canada
$40 shipping
isn't there some local canadian firm that ships the parts to you for cheap?
for a watch!
There's an engraver I'd like, found out about it from a friend, $655 for the cutter/engraver.
maybes. I haven't really looked into it that far Cat
Ray used roar
owo
I had to pay £1.24 for the cheapest shipping for a cd the other week
/me hasn't exactly kept up with things since she gave up on buying a new computer
02Ray used Angryface
$300 for the shipping, or was it $600 for the cutter, $355 for the shipping? Either way, at least $300 shipping. ._.
the cd itself cost about 40p D:
used on amazon
how big is a cutter/engraver?
02*WB03(Feather03)02WB* - <Feather> 10Kiddyland :D
Ehm...this one isn't that big, but it's probably insured shipping.
Thin glass tube and whatnot.
how big is not that big? <.<
Can fit on a desk.
/me tactically sits on Kipi
Noel Fielding comes on wearing a cape or poncho or something! o.O
And smaller than my friends' schools' Universal VLS.
"oh bristol you... cheeky little otters, how are you??"
meep ._.
/me squirms under Espeon
Hi
he's such a strange guy
:D
meepkipi
/me lies on Kipi too
oh well
02Fuzzy
RP left
otters are adorable <3
fuzzy indeed
I cannot be kitty hat
:~
:<
they're like sea kittens!
not the PETA approved version >.>
02http://punditkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/49c4f55c-25e8-4b76-a322-08a42fbe57f6.jpg
And what is this about fuzzy Kipi
02So that's where they come from...
PETA can gdiaf.
eww, peta
they are smelly
/me has no opinion about the PETA but thinks sea kittens is dumb
How's that insulin, hipocrite?
Heh.
02Espie sat on him
Lol Bramuda Triangle
02LOL What, where?
Their leader, that creepy woman, called a terrorist a fine young man.
I think they did when they first developed it.
Kipi
:3
/me hides Kipi under him
Yuush?
/me still has no opinion on the PETA
all I know is that their campaigns are a bit weird
although if they're aiming for attention they've got it
5Hi peoples~
What about supporting a group that breaks into animal labs, destroys them, sets fires to them and spray paints their slogans all over the place?
02Hi RP
Hi (again oo3)
Because they've done that.
5 8D
sometimes I feel kind of like that's necessary
sometimes
it depends though
5I actually was hoping to ask Aurora a quick question, but I'll wait 'til she comes in..
:3
5So how're you two?
I don't know things about PETA
07she's here o3o
?
me neither
Tired rtololol
well
5Oh huh. xD I thought maybe you were busy.
I need to leave really soon
like
2 minutes
so hurry?
insulin is cultured from bacteria nowadays
D:
I'd totally have broken into the lab of the guy who did the pit of despair experiments and set it on fire though >.>
5Okay, um, in DRP, what's the reference to "the rocky outcropping" and "Konek" that Cygnus makes?
Yeah, their leader called a terrorist a fine young man, he's admitted to starting like seven fires and been charged with arson twice, is all I
'm saying.*
um
it used to be made by taking pig's pancreases and crushing them up and extracting it from that
that doesn't exactly mean anything
5Like, i just didn't understand that. o-o
the rocky outcropping is the rocky outcropping I made up in one of my posts
where konek, his employer, is waiting
the United States started as "terrorists" too
yep ^^
5Where is it in relation to where the fight is?
um
Our founders were terrorists <3
it's where cygnus is flying
so
dead ahead
5(Drevnij is basically useless right now and I want to drag him into a fight or something lol.)
Yes, but we didn't burn down animal testing labs.
most countries started that way >.>
5Thus why I haven't posted yet.
ok well
I think that we should respect Finland way more than we do.
5I'll send him after Cygnus?
Curly: You're supposed to call them freedom fighters though
squish it
5Ohhh right~ 8D I can work with that.
now
I'm gonna go to work
generally any group that calls themselves freedom fighters are just as bad as everyone else >.>
5Bye~
02Huh... girls and ther DRPs...
5 /late lol
/me eyes the "freedom fighters" in Africa
5It's fun!
who knows though
/me rolls his shiny eyes
02-shiny
maybe those freedom fighters will start up the next USA
the United States of Africa >.>
02Shiny is bad
5Besides, my name here IS kind of RP4L... thus I would join the most popular roleplay on TST, yes?
02OF COURSE
5It's only /logical/.
Meh, I ain't too fond of the United States of Amurikuh.
I would *so* love seccession.
seccession from what?
the united states of antarctica!
:D
The North.
oh okays
The USA actually had a pretty nice revolution -- it was peaceful and principled and we got so lucky to have the leadership that we had
5But no, it's not the name on my birth certificate. ;P
George Washington actually had a lot of people encouraging him to become a dictator among his army
wasn't the civil war one of the bloodiest wars in history?
And he was in a position to do so
5Uh, well I'm not. x3;
02Even though I haven't met any
ok I am back
welcome back ^^
Curly, heh, yeah.
5I have. And they're nothing like me.
Over 600,000 men died.
you're just in time for history class!
Curly: WWII had more people killed than the Civil War had people alive
I knows
Millions and millions died in WWII
She didn't say THE bloodeist.
12 8D
She said ONE of.
but that doesn't cross the Civil War out as one of the bloodiest wars in history
12Homework... dune
12done
12hai rp4l
somewhere on the top 20 list I think
But seriously, guys, what are we going to do if Finland attacks?!
The US hasn't had that many wars
02Oh Hi Starlitzone
I really think we need to disband like 90% of the US military tbh
I was just poking at the "peaceful and principled" bit
I don't like what we've become
12hello HML
12Im still tired
12bed soon
omg http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_and_anthropogenic_disasters_by_death_toll
it's not on there
I said top 20 list >.>;
oh wait
that is 20 xD
maybe top 50 then :p
:p
but that's still pretty high up
Curly: The Civil War had the most people killed on US soil than any other war
RP
:D
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_War
/me lazytime time
Cya
The US is in a position where it really doesn't need to worry about threat of invasion
or rather, "gather enough sleep to be able to function tomorrow/later today"
oh well
02Night
I'd be more worried about our own government.
Cya xF
Yeah
02Timing
Gimme a rifle and I'll defend my home to the death, come hell or high water.
Canada doesn't really need to worry either and probably needs to worry less
Dunno
Well
Not doing it tonight
why not have a smaller, more elite army like the UK?
But I dunno if I'll continue streaming at all :E
You're the only person that watches >.>;
Because, obviously, more guns = better.
Duh.
12XD
12wait
Canada needs to protect its borders though!
12that was fail
much more sensible
the US's nukes are like 50 years old
who knows if they'll even fire anymore
:p
I'm more than twenty percent sure they'd fire.
I'm sure some of them will
I'm sure some of them won't too :p
It's not like they're just sitting in the dirt alone, military techs and whatnot.
that's pretty awesome
12night
12i have to go to sleep now
02bye
12see you guys... tomorrow?
12night
hi
things can't just sit there unused forever and still work though, they can't replace everything
._.
Hai.
D:
/me hides.
Okay. I get it.
xD
D: Jeez.
sorry, I'm a bit hyper or something :p
I noticed. :p
I'm sleepy, but I've had a lot of soda. So I really don't know what I am right now.
/me tackles Cat to the ground.
Lukewarm? :D
/me clings to Strkyer's side
:3
:O
/me can't stand up, due to being unbalanced now.
:O
/me would have used string, so as to not hurt cat and give him something to play with, like yarn or somesuchthing.
you have to learn to cooperate, it's the only way you can save yourselves, and then save the world D:
Strycat or sumthin'
;_;
/me rolls forever!
I don't do teams well.
/me rolls too!
see? teamwork!
^^
My name would be far too long.
Strykat! :D
or Strykar! >_>
Or run away!
/me runs.
/me fails due to being attached to a rolling Cat.
/me yawns
/me bites Curly.
I think I ran out of hyper juice
/me is nommed
/me injects Curly with caffeine.
/me twitches
/me falls backwards into her bed
D:
/me pokes Curly with a stick.
Is it still alive?
/me does not know!
I need to sleep soon D:
I suggest staying back a few feet though.
No you don't, Cat.
/me twitches
I do though
got lectures tomorrowise
I'm going to sleep in around 2 hours
noooooooo
yeeeeeeees O:
I have stuffs to do tomorrow
like shopping and going out with friends to eat and an appointment
Pfft.
Friends!
PFFT, I say!
I gots ta learn more programmin'
but it's food!
oh
speaking of which...
/me transfers $300 to her chequings account
can't forget that >_>
so yeah
sleeptiem
bai!
Bai!
bye O:
D:
/me cuts the tape
I'm adopting my English teacher as an imouto
xD
now I have to imagine her as a bubbly eyed anime character :p
:3
/me nods
http://gallery.mobile9.com/f/1579939/
She's awesome though
my friend Thomas was friends with his grade... 11 English teacher
http://gallery.mobile9.com/f/1264991/ Better!
he sent her text messages about random things
liiike... smoking weed >.>
xD
College is cool
"hey ms. T, I'm getting high!"
I'm on a first name basis with a lot of the people there
I have no idea what he referred to her as
/me is just guessing
I'm on first name basis with all my teachers though
but... that's normal at my college
everyone's on first name basis with the teachers >.>
/me has no teachers.
/me wins.
I call my teacher by his last name, no mr, but that's common with him
Because he is Father Time.
Father Time?
your teacher's god? O:
/me grabs the shotgun.
Where is he?
No, he's just older than everything ever.
it's kind of funny how the list of oldest people alive is totally filled with women ^^
/me wonders why though
and it's not olive oil >.>
'cause they nagged their husbands to death!
/me runs
/me chuckles.
>.>
/me wonders if any of them were lesbians
/me doubts it though
the lifespan of lgbt people is pretty low on average :I
/me is going to die young!
I am horrible at authoring.
/me is too.
I think the most I've ever written in one book is like...four pages?
that sounds about the same as my writing dedication
I wrote 200+ pages.
For one story.
Plus I am not good at writing, I feel like I am rambling on. D:
/me gives Curly some of it.
So it's not stealing. :p
even better :D
/me wants to try being a lesbian
It sounds so cool
It is.
I want to try not being me, it sounds fun.
I'd like to try not being me too :O
No. D:
I can't decide on a ringtone I want.
I need to buy more things from Gamestop. >.<
*^-^*
Psh. :p
Hmm
Two more days.
D:
Why less? ._.
why more D:
Why not? D:
buy from Steam instead, unless you're poking at console games at least
Because they just launched their rewards program. So I want free(ish) things. :p
I'm talking about console games.
I never buy PC games outside of Steam.
okays, nevermind me then!
I want a ps3
Come here and you can have mine. :p
O:
/me coaxes Curly into visiting.
what State do you live in again?
Michigan.
/me drops by Michigan
:3
/me gives Curly her PS3.
lol, I wouldn't actually take it
;_;
/me just visits
You hate me. ._.
but.. wouldn't visiting you just to take your ps3 be worse? D:
That isn't the point. Let's pretend you visit me and I make the PS3 a gift, just because I can. :o It all works out.
I don't even play on the PS3. <.<
that works then :O
/me is still iffy on taking the PS3
It does! :o
D:
Why now? ;_;
I don't know, I've never been good at accepting gifts >.>
It's afraid of Canadia!
/me throws the PS3 at Curly.
xD
Take the damn PS3. D:<
fine fine :p
/me runs away before she can reject it.
/me intercepts it and hands it gently to Curly
:o
/me wonders where Michigan is on the map
Somewhere!
It's uh
lol
Somewhere.
See? :D
/me wikis
Do it.
oh right! lake Michigan
/me forgot
I could drop by on my road trip :O
^_^
/me is still planning to road trip across the continent
We can make a lesbian only club with just us three as starting members
you have to bring DT too, Ari!
yea really :P
four*
mhm
unless we get a wig ? o_O
/me is a lesbian becuase he said so
/me gets a knife
xD
There's a few other modifications needed for that to work
>:|
Drag queens can be bothersome. That's a no go, man.
:X
I am going to be a male guy and I'm going to still be a lesbian
o.o;
Good luck with that.
xD
/me sharpens his bayonet
:3
hmmm going to go crawl in the bed and get on the laptop brb
I wish I could crawl into bed with a laptop :I
I wish I had a laptop.
/me throws his netbook to Curly
And a good bed.
And my own room.
you don't have your own room?
/me gets his toolbelt
Not really.
that sucks :I
I share it with my three step sisters.
It's... bleh. <.<
hi Lulu!
Ow
:o
/me equips sunglasses.
welcome back DT~!
._. Please don't break them.
thanks Curly
I didn't break them, I tapped them D:
/me hides again.
hmmm
/me isn't sure if she's going to last another hour and a half before going to sleep :X
I kind of wish I could shuffle :<
Sure you will.
shuffle? liiike dragging your feet on the ground or like shuffling cards or something completely else?
I think he means like an MP3 player.
Clearly.
I wish I could play songs with having no screen, yes, right from my face.
Curly, like the hardstyle dancing.
That'd be epic, Proto.
Indeed :D
HI
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfSIcx1YgVE
jumpstyle makes you look rather seizureistic imo.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGAatCB4KCw&feature=related Good one also.
Although them dancing infront of traffic to disrupt it at the end is kinda stupid an rude.
if a car decided not to stop and hit them they'd be at fault too :O
the dancers I mean
for standing in the middle of the road of course
I like Fluro's pants
and it would be awesome if you could make music right from your face xD
it's called singing!
AHA!
hi :O
/me leaps out and startles everyone
hello
there is a lot of people that think music comes out of there A** Curly :P
Nawt teh saem! D:
^Curly
well, judging by some people's singing *coughs and points at herself* I wouldn't be too surprised >.>
just got done with building my theoretical parts list, and I think I am happy
TeeHee, Curly.
how is everyone else?
alright
you ?
happy
Horrible.
:O
why are you horrible?
:O
/me hugs back.
Just not feeling well, health wise.
Sleep takes care of that
go sleep
Plus having a problem with a friend doesn't help. ._.
D:
No
I will keep your spot warm for you
I'm not slee- *falls asleep*
oh, you are having issues with a friend?
Yeah.
:p Not quite to that extent.
Just some mindless arguing.
what are you two fighting bout?
It's to the point where I'm not even sure anymore.
do you know how it started?
It started with us both being in a bad mood, so we both got set off by stupid things. Minor disagreements.
/me pokes Cat
Escalated into... now. He's pissed, I'm just sitting there listening. He provokes me, moar arguing. Calm down. Repeat.
oh, thats never good
/me pets Cat
My ex, Ari.
sleeping is apparenly failing
Possible boyfriend, but I'm not sure. Eh.
:O
noooooo
/me thinks that sounds like her relationship with Kata
mien
>_<
/me offers...something?
/me bans Curly from contacting Kata ever
/me puts Kata on the blackballed list
I haven't talked to that jackass in ages.
well, you should explain to him that because he is a male, he should be sorry and apologize. Also note how he needs to apologize at random points in the day, for anything or nothing, just to cover all his bases
the urge to talk to Kata has gone away
Okay good
/me puts Kata on a tiny spaceship and shoots him into deepsace.
All we did was argue because he thought I shouldn't talk to Gareth. And so he got pissed.
sometimes the girl needs to apologize too you know, it's not like girls can't handle responsability
He won't apologize. :p No matter what.
It even makes me cringe when I see people talking about talking to Kata
and obviously some guys can't either
I'd apologize but... uh...
who is Kata?
I'm not sure what I did anymore. :/
some person
anyone care to tell me via PM?
A dick.
Drama queen.
Well, no
There, I summed it up in two words. :D
Basically, he has BPD
I forgot emo, but I guess that falls under drama queen.
BPD people are messed up
Bi-Polar Disorder?
It's not his fault, his personality is just wired wrong
/me supposedly has BPD. <.<
borderline personality disorder
Oh
Pfeh.
Borderline Personality .... yeah, what Curly said
:/
He has bipolar too, no?
You really need to stay away form people who have BPD -- always
it's pretty much on the same level as sociopathy in psychiatric circles
Or so was his claim.
incurable
and hard to deal wiht
That's what I said before people realized he was messed up
I know this is wrong, but people with mental issues should be put on a no breed list. they can bang, they just can't breeed
I was like, don't talk to him, he's BPD
But does anyone listen to me? noooooooo
I listen to you Ari
:)
/me snuggles up to ari
^_^
those kinds of mental illnesses aren't genetic
Agreed, Annual. >.>
And Ari
Where were you when I was 'friends' with him? D:
and they're not really illnesses
sure its not BDP big dumb prick ?
Hah.
pretty much xD
sure works for him :P
This gum has lost it's flavor :<
:(
psychiatric "disorders" are really just personalities that aren't compatible society
Proto needs moar gum, STAT!
not illnesses
I forget what someone told me I had
But it made me interesting :D
oh, hell, I have a personality "disorder" then. If I said half the things I thought I would be carted off to prison for life as a preventative measure
So would everyone. lol
it's not a disorder if it doesn't actually harm anything
hmm
that's the definition of disorder :O
well
sociopathy itself isn't inherently a disorder
my thoughts tend to psychologically harm others
since many socipaths are very sane
maybe *too* sane
yeah
I was bout to say that
Sociopatha are way too damned logical
:3
sociopaths*
I'm probably a little sociopathic
we all are
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKp1c9qVWxI&feature=related
LOL
oh hai capslock
well, if you empathize with anybody, or feel sorry for something you've done, you're not a sociopath
wait, would being able to rationalize all of your feelings be sociopathic?
because the definition of sociopath is pretty much somebody that doesn't have a conscience
hmm
aka somebody who doesn't feel guilt
Oh cool, I'm not a sociopath.
Since I feel bad for *everything* I do.
sociopaths are rare
I am just barely not a sociopath
Even if it doesn't harm anyone. :p
it's just sociopathy :p
kitties are cute!
yay, kitties
people...not so much
I feel bad for taking up space and food that could go to people who need it.
well, that means you have a conscience somewhere
I try and not be one of them dicks that throws away most of their food, which is why I will force myself to eat everything on my plate and not throw away leftovers unless they are clearly bad or I am told to
I buried my conscience a long time ago :P
/me hands DT a shovel
start digging
no no :X
I can't stand to see food thrown away either
D:
leave it
I am ok without it
/me insists
/me digs for DT.
/me offers some Taco Bell to everyone
thar be buried treasure next to it
:D
mmm, food
:D
:D
omg Taco Bell
TACO BELL!!!!
/me noms the taco hell
^_^
/me eats it ALL
xD
my desk seems like, 4 times bigger since i put my tower on the floor o.O
/me demands driving directions to Ari's location
lol
/me comes back and sees he missed free food :<
anybody build a lot of PC's?
I can build a PC
but I don't build lots of them >.>
I built mine and have upgraded various others
:3
I built mine.
/me just takes apart her computers and maintains them and puts them back together again
I build a lot yea
/me steals Curly's disc drive.
that's okay, I have like 10 of them :X
too many to the point its a drain on my wallet >_<
D:
/me steals 9 of them.
D:
Annual, I can turn on my netbook, does that count? :D
And a half.
9 1/2
I'm using like 6 T_+T
DT might know whether or not this case is useable then
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811147098
lol
for what purpose ?
time to rip some cds
generally you don't need a gigantic case unless you're doing crazy cooling rigs or recording stuff
oh
that's decent for like a home computer for office and chatting
Multimedia, with occasional RTS gaming
it's microATX, just buy a motherboard to that standard
well if you are doing a basic computer I am sure its fine, you gotta ... what cat said
the graphics card I want to slip in it is low profile and has HDMI out
does it have a slot for a pci-e graphics card?
>_<
I feel like I'm going to be sick
it probably won't even be able to fit a good graphics card :I
yea it does
has to be a low profile
it is
is that like, a single-slot card?
mine takes up two D:
but I don't know how much I would trust that Power supply with a vid card
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814141119
the cheap PSUs they put in some of these cases can't handle all that much
I can give it a better powersupply
oh, yeah, generally you'd want like a 500watt power supply for gaming
my graphics card is pretty much the opposite of low-profile
at least
I think
same Cat lol
/me hasn't been keeping up to date
/me is waaaay behind.
/me shuts up.
should be ok
I think I'll just stick to lasers.
I'd like a bigger case with more cooling
Annual, were you considering buying that rosewill case?
as long as the PSU is not total crap
yes, I was, why?
I guess check up on the reviews and see if you see a lot of complaints about it
the PSU that is
Annual, it's a piece of crap, don't.
wouldn't a slim computer case be worse at cooling?
why?
Annual, if you're getting a decent PSU, why pay for the $50 shitty case?
yea of course Curly
yeah, Lu's right >.>
Annual, because rosewill makes crappy cases.
especially if you're going to game
And mice.
yea I gotta agree with Lu, I only will buy high end cases though :X
my case is by Coolermaster!
same
not gonna game, I would not consider Rise of nations or Dawn of War one gaming
and cost me £30
well both of my main ones are
D:
the case I was looking at was a coolermaster one too >.>
and a Antec
and a AeroCool
:X
does having the tower on top of the desk or below the desk make any difference to airflow?
under the desk picks up a LOT more dust :P
trust me on this one lol
but, the other cases are soooooo much more expensive!
lemme read the reviews
besides, not like the power drain will be all that much
I opened a case today and there was more dust in there than I've ever seen in one spot :X
/me points at the dust mines
it wasn't actually the interior of the case itself, that was fine, but I took the front cover off it and it was just crammed >.>
the worst I have ever seen is the computer I built for my ex .... a year later
yeah, this was like a 15 year old computer
she never cleaned it and it looked like a cat or something blew up in there xP
and I'm sure no one's *ever* taken the front cover off it
XD
my pc isn't even a year old!
so much dust and nasty
he is young
Hahahahahahahah.
o/ guys

/me passes the link on
/me blinks at huge link
I like how that case looks ^^
That link isn't large.
Really.
youtube has some crazy long links
It is on my screen D:<
Agreed Curly
Youtube?
oooh, minimalist
I wants
/me stares at Curly.
mmhm
anything with a door to me is yuck anymore
How did Youtube get into the conversation? D:
I was looking at this http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811119230
links?
I am never think they are made well enough
liiike
D:
that link wasn't long at all!
Doors would probably get annoying for me
yea I have the HAF 922 RED
YouTube's failed me T_T
even if I barely use the drive bays
Or this thing
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811103039
Ewwww the fans change colors
yuck I don't like the xclios
I worked on one a year or so ago
Annual, http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817190027
was junk all around
Heh, I was pointing out the overninethousand fans
that's the cheapest good PSU on the site.
I don't like the super flashy cases
/me has always been a fan of elegance
http://www.coolermaster-usa.com/product.php?category_id=19&product_id=2986 <-- yea thats my main case
well, it is 12V, so it should work with what I want to stick in the case
nice case, but a bit bright D:
hey O:
Haha there's a <5" 12v psu
I think that's the exact same case I was looking at
yeah, it's like 3 feet tall and nearly a foot wide >.>
yea its a awesome case
and that power supply is totally overkill for someone running a low end system, sorry to say
I still think level ten is the stupidest case ever.
I like tight aluminum cases with a smooth finish
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811133089
I like everything to be black
yea I had thought about a aluminum Lian Li
http://www.mini-box.com/s.nl/it.A/id.417/.f
That PSU :D
/me adds the improved PSU to his list and stands back
oh god the pico PSUs
>_<
http://www.silentpcreview.com/article601-page1.html
/me prances away from DT.
not too bad still, just $570
lol
Annual, hey, did you get that link I put there for you?
yes, that price I just listed is with the PSU added
This is where I first saw it: http://short-circuit.com/product/picoPSU-90.html
Annual, and if you think $100 is too much for a PSU, then you shouldn't pay more than $300 for the entire system.
I was looking for a 3.5A, 36V PSU.
I never said 100 is too much for a PSU
I am going for quality with a minimal profile without sacrificing functionality too much
I said 700 watt is overkill for someone that is running a system that will pull 350 watt max
and there is a lot of good PSUs for under $100
given I would not buy anything under $50 for the life of me
Annual, minimal profile? why is that a good thing?
http://thepcmdaz.com/images/hpa305w.JPG
there's my case :D
well, I am looking at it this way: if I get a 100 dollar 700 watt PSU, then that should last me quite a long time, and even allow me to stick it into a larger and more powerful system
my old case (the one I dumped a year ago) was one of those 1990s white box style cases >.>
my power button glows bright blue ^^
yea I remember Curly it was a old Dell XPS T system lol
yes I realize it's super old
Annual, the wattage isn't as important as the efficiency rating
Annual, so yes, it's a good lasting PSU, but anyways, why is minimal profile a good thing?
/me supposes a 200watt psu with super conductors would probably be as good as a 500watt with copper wires >.>
Amperage is the main thing your looking for
minimal profile means it can sit on the glass shelving units above my HDTV and not look unsightly
http://pastebin.com/4RQdYHvf
that is the full parts listing
Annual, ahh, a set-top box, makes sense now
yeah
I think if a slim case best suits your needs, go for it
and according to you you won't even be doing high performance stuff
so it shouldn't matter
I hope to build it to replace the need for a Blu-Ray player and be able to play RTS games on the 52 inch screen, as well as do web browsing and everyday computing
is the 52-inch screen 1080p?
52" would make it kinda pixelated unless you can AA the hell out of it right?
yes
most big screens seem to be
Goodbye.
it'd be nice if they could have higher resolutions and just keep 1080p for 22-24" screens really
if the visual quality seems to be suffering, I will just turn the 4:3 ratio on
wait
no, I watch a lot of things in 1080P, does not seem to suffer much
if at all
when you're sat on a sofa you're far away enough to not see any aliasing anyway
Yeah
I sit within 4 feet of the screen
off to the side
seeya Proto
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813121399
why not just buy a computer monitor for a 22"-24" screen?
they have better than 1080p >.>
the first time I saw a "high definition" monitor I was kind of disappointed
I've not seen any monitors with a higher resolution than 1920x1080 that wasn't ridiculously expensive :/
ugh I have used Atom boards they are not powerful enough for a lot of stuff, specially if he wants to do some gaming ..... but anyway I gotta go
job early in the morning
Cat, 1920x1080 isn't the same thing as 1080p
I dunno, Intel Atom runs Morrowind quite nicely
really Curly?
I don't know anything about tvs D:
there's a reason computer monitors aren't termed in something p
p stands for progressive scan
most computer monitors don't even work that way
my two monitors are 1920x1080, then
one is 22", the other is 24"
so do computer monitors generally do it better?
yeah
:/ but why would I go off and buy a new screen when I have one already around?
there's a reason why an 80" computer monitor is $50,000 and an 80" tv monitor is only $1000 :p
god knows who would buy an 80" computer monitor though but apparently there's a market for it
Annual, I was just talking about Cat's comment
you can buy 80" computer monitors??
yes
$1,000 is a lot of money. ._. (</back for a bit>)
you'd have to crane your neck to see the whole thing, surely?
o.O
there was one on NewEgg
well
you'd probably sit it far away
I'm quite happy with 3840x1080, thanks
DX
I didn't notice DT leave >_<
poor Curly
/me was reading scrollback when DT left
reading and replying to >_>
The 65" monitors are averaging $,7000
D:
about 15 minutes ago, apparently
18 past
yeah Proto, big computer monitors are insanely expensive >.>
<Lu> Annual, hey, did you get that link I put there for you?
<Annual> yes, that price I just listed is with the PSU added
This is where I first saw it: http://short-circuit.com/product/picoPSU-90.html
2 12W speakers
for a 70" monitor
Fail

Damn mIRC.
I dun wanna register.
:3
And I'm gone again.
D: why Proto ?
Because.
hi :)
:p
Goodbye, Curly.
hi Curly c:
/me greets the channel.
hi hi Proto :D
._.
But I like the channel, anyways.
lol
time to try sleeping again I think
I fail at this
srsly
Sleeping is bad, though.
bye Cat, again :p
bye!
And so it dies once Cat leaves.

nuuuuh uuuuh
yeah, thats not true
I hate cows.
/me sees cows eat all the time
HEATHEN!
I doubted it but it's still funny to cite Cracked as fact :p
In the sothern hemisphere, do they eat facing south?
xD
Cracked. <3
:/
:o

I love Cracked :O

heeeey
I was just preparing my application =D

Curly is thinking she might go to bed in 5 minutes
**10minutes
/me bounces a banana off var's head
xD
/me chases after the nana
/me really wants to make a long and complicated friend application paper for being his friend, and have it look a lot like a phone contract
I have a busy day tomorrow though, so I don't really have a choice >:
Do it.
:o
No.
Bad Curly.
Stay. Forever. Never leave us.
**15minutes
Or that.
lol
but... I have an appointment, and a shopping trip, and stuff D:
noooo
I don't care.
**20mintues
D:
2000 minutes.
either agree to the terms or stay longer v_v
I'd stay longer if I had an alarm clock >.>
such things are not important. why visit prior committments or buy physical objects when you can sit in front of your computer screen all day and all night, sipping on Dr Pepper and nomming Ramen?
/me fashions him into an alarm clock.
:o go get one on ur shopping trip
oh right, I was meaning to
/me begins beeping
/me jots that down
DR. PEPPER AND RAMEN
There.

/me chews on the chew
/me short circuits D:
D:
yay! that means I get to sleep
no u still gots some minz left ma'am
I AM the man! then again, I am not sure if there is a single other male in this channel
/me turns into an alarm clock, too.
/me beeps louder than var did.
a few, var's the only one talking at the moment I think
so I might be The last man on Epic-Chat
oh
Var's the only one beeping at the moment*
xD
/me nuzzles var <3
/me cuddles Curly <3
hmm
I refuse to acknowledge an alarm clock as a member of my gender
Get a room.
/me anti-pokes Lu
Can't sleep
/me grumbles
Also, <3 the /clear feature
hey, we usually keep it private D:
:P
it's not like we're making out or something
Proto, get to bed now before I come and tuck you into bed, then sit in a wood chair across the room and watch you sleep
do eet
Not that you would mind that.
/me hides.
that wasn't the point :p
ouch
hmmm
that would be a new sensation
lets do it
Would be a quick sensation
does not matter
as long as it is new and exciting
D:
/me isn't sure what's going on now.
you cant do that Proto
I can to
\o/
/me flows.

weeeeeeeeeee
go with the flow of blood from my caratoid
Let's all flow!
eeewww

I spell that right?
Close
no i
damn
/me spins around on his barstool
weeeeeeee!

:/ that could be read a wrong way
/me chuckles.

not that I mind or anything
/me is being crushed
/me dies
/me dies
/me dies
o.o

somebody loves april
Uhoh.
I hate April.
So cold
not cold :o
Well
April is kinda hot in the last half

I must go to sleep now :(
/me hugs everyone goodnight
I am too! Goodnight everyone. [:
D:
noooz
I must! my workplace is evil and oddly frowns upon coming in late
you cant leave :c.
I have to be up at 5:30. :x
I'll be online throughout the day tomorrow
no you dooooonnt
I has Jmirc
i dunno what that is :o
\o/ success!
Jmirc is a mobile phone IRC application that works on pretty much any phone
lmfao. I'm on the phone though, so don't expect me to talk much.
There's a DANCE? :D
if your phone has mobile java, it can run Jmirc
oh ya
heh
Wait I am using webOS
/me can has teh Jirc? :D
it is kinda hard to download, you gotta type in the url into your browser, they dont make it clickable
Fml...
:c
RUN!
:o oh hai
Hai. :o
goodnight :o
/me wants a hug, too! D:
/me hugs
http://jmirc.sf.net/jmIrc.jad (case sensitive
type that into your phones browser
\o/
>:| be gone you fowl sleepy beasties.
D:
/me feels unwanted. ._.
D:
/me hugged though D:
CURLY
RAWR
D:
She left!
DL
D:(
D:**
/me leaves too
sorry, no I haven't D:
._.;
:O CURLY CANT LEAVE
mwahaha
/me is just distracted by researching piercings
ooo
I figured if I'm going to go get one soon I should know what I'm doing >.>
/me was thinking she'd go by the same rules as looking for a tattoo parlour and she's pretty much right
I didn't know tongue piercings healed so fast though
Blargh.
i didnt think they did
they heal in like a month
I'm too much of a wimp for piercings. lol
lol that doesnt sound very fast
/me thought Curly meant a week or 2 :p
nuh uuh
uh huh!
I guess if you're gonna create a hole in yourself... That's a pretty good amount of time.
/me pierced her ear
me too!
it healed in a couple of days
/me didn't not!
/me is odd. ._.
and my right ear still isn't totally healed
I didn't either D:
:O
We can be odd together!
the average healing time for an ear lobe piercing is about 4-6 monhts
:O NOOOWAAAAY
yesway
show me :o
well I could tell you from experience
http://www.youngwomenshealth.org/body-piercing.html
there's also that
so could i :o
Pfft. Experience doesn't mean anything.
I had to clean my piercings every single day for like a month or else they'd get crusty from blood
idk about when i first got them pierced but when i did it myself it was like a couple of days
i did the same but not for as long :o
maybe i am superhuman :p
Huh, the male genitalia is faster than the navel
...
o.o
Wha...
now that i find hard to believe
In healing time D:
lots of blood going around there
Oh
>.>
>_<
XD
I don't want to know how else that sentence could be read =P
<.<
/me coughs.
/me didn't think there'd be any other ways to read it ._.;
There probably aren't
But I'm getting tired.
If they didn't click the link it might not make sense.
oooh
what you said
But... I clicked the link...
well yeah that would have been weird if it was out of context :p
pfft, you can pierce ur own body.
if the thing about ear cartilage is true i dont wanna do it anymore
I don't understand how your piercing healed in a few days >.>
mmz i dunno
i pierced one ear one day and the other the next
then it was healed in approx a week
:3
So
I hate songs that bring back memories
For no obvious reason.
/me too
http://wimp.com/petowl/
I hate the song best friend by Jazon Mraz.
That works too. \o/
:3
And I was like......
Baby baby baby OHHHHHHHHHHH
. . .
I'm sorry
Forget I said that
D:
okays, research complete!
I don't know you anymore.
noooooo
/me is going to go to bed now
/me cries
/me clings to Curly.
/me is decided on a belly piercing for tomorrow
B-But... I'll be lonely if you leave!
DL
D:
Goodnight, Curly.
I was just saying it ironically :3
Sleep well, friend.
I have to go to sleep sometime >:
But you're not Curly! D:
it's okay if it's done ironically, that counters it :3
._.
Fine. *sulks* I don't mind.
I'm here?

D:
D:

:o
/me huggles MOAR

Bai. ._.; Sleep well.
/me highfives Curly
Oh god no.
/me highfives

/me goes back to Off The Chain.
:<
D:
I don't like that single he had. >.< It was like... on the radio a lot
And I completely forgot the name, so I look stupid.
idk if i like all of his songs
/me prob doesnt
i like one of them at least tho :3
I'm Yours.
I hated that one.
Yeah that's it
With a firey burning passion.

Well... because then it's three-way relationship. And three is a pretty cool number
LoL
But two's company, three's a crowd, and I don't want to be just another face in the crowd.
/me is building an awesome Hlaalu manor \o/
/me would like to know about the cute girl

/me sings "I get lost... I get lost... I get lost in crowds, if I can, I remain invisible..."

what pizza places do they have around your area?
The only sport I like is swimming :D
And then of course, I do not like watching it D:

I'm done with math
for the rest of the semester

For the rest of my college experience in GCC
o.o
I finished with a B so I don't have to take the final. The professor said I could and if I did, the Final would replace my lowest test
however
02o.o
If I took the final, I would need to get at least a 95% to jump to an A, so I decided it's not really worth it.
So she said if we're satisfied with our grade, we're free to...
OMG

Ive got something cool to show you soon.
3ILL TELL ICY!
I heard alot of bad things about it though
No
yeah
7WoW, lol?
World of warcraft
7Well, it certainly drains it.
:P
depends on the server you go on
3oj :D
And ill kill you
I dont like the idea of pay to play
If you dont play
10World of Warfail
3that's right! :D
Lol
they just need to lower the monthly payment
Oj?
Your money goes down the drain
3(only joking)
yeah XD that's the only problem
But I heard some very bad stories about it
if they removed that part, Im pretty sure Skylands would take back what she said since she probably never played the game before :P
Like this one
A bf and gf
The bf is addicted to WoW
oh and its easily addicting
He even left to go play WoW and left his Gf in the hospital while shes giving birth
:/
wow
If you've never played a game maybe
/me 14murrs.
3"Dude, stop pervin' on my tomato soup!!@
I hate it when poeple start insulting the game when they never actually played it
if you are gonna insult it, atleast have some expirience of actually PLAYING the game.
kthxbai.
/me hides
lol
WoW is mediocre at best. I think its only popular because it happens to be online
lol
When did it first start anyway?
I like oj
Oh
:P
Good
Hi
/me bites a little harder
runescape sucks in my opinion. And before you asked, yes, I've played it.
7D:
7RS.
Yeah I quitted lmao
7I played it until Java borked on my computer.
3omg, its veefa!
Its so grindy :(
http://www.cracked.com/article_18461_5-creepy-ways-video-games-are-trying-to-get-you-addicted.html
10I stopped playing due to boredom
3*runs for the hills*
7Grindy, meh.
And the community too
7Do you want to speed through a game?
In my opinion
Warcraft then Warcraft II then Warcraft III then World of Warcraft then WoW: Burning Crusade then WoW: Wrath of the Lichking and now WoW: Cataclysm
which comes out tomorrow
The most important attribute to a game is it's community
If the community is so bad
Full of hacker/scammers
The in-game economy takes a hit
7LOL
7LAWL
The only "progress" is leveling up and finding nifty items & mounts.
I played mabinogi
7Hackers? XD
People still do that dragon cave thing?
Yeah, hi
7People can't hack RS.
I know lol
7And economy, LOLOLOL.
But just saying
:P
How are you?
In mabinogi
it changed so much
7It has one of the most complex economies in MMORPGs.
since I played
Pretty good, you?
Muffler robes are worth
I'm good thanks.
10k now
I'd rather play TES
I saved up for 5 months on it
xD
1m~
Where've you been lately? :p
Plus I got scammed a few times
You*
7In Mabinogi?
3DUDE, WTF ARE U DOING ON MY ASS?
mhm
You disappeared again
You ever seen Russel Howard's Good News? "Edward Cullen had never been more hungry for blood in his life, Bella was on her period".
7Scammed how?
Well
You know me
Im too nice
lololol
Computer problems.
I lend things to newbies and bam
:P
ah
7RS has a lending system. :P
But sometimes I just get ripped off lmao
But I dont mind
3...
Its the newbies that sicken me the most
7The economic price for goods allows you so you can't get too much or too little for something.
Well in mabinogi
There isnt really a stock market
its just based on other people's judgement lol
Lol ;P
Yeah
He gave me his name and i stayed
I probably should change it...

Greed?

Curly, what phone do you have'
I can't access anything without signing in or something >_>
an htc mytouch (aka magic)
3g, not the slide
rogers?
I had a magic once.

Ive owned a lot of android phones.
no, it's a t-mobile
are you using it on wind mobile?
I bought it specifically because the mytouch (but not the magic) is compatible with... yeah

I just got it today
why else would you get an incompatible phone lol

it's good enough for me
'and you will pay out of the ass to use it anywhere else in canada

Daft Punk is hawt so far. xD
because I can't even access my wifi settings without signing in
XD
you can
Can never like it.
how?
ive done it a hundred times
:(
Don't even try to force it on me
you should be able to access wifi settings by clicking menu
I'll shrug it off like sc2
Human after all is my favorite song of theirs
and selecting wifi settings
so you can activate it.
if not do a 4 corner tap
but there is no menu button for wifi in there
4 corner tap?
It's so simple, yet...so chill. o:
technologic, something about us, da funk, harder better faster stronger, around the world, and one more time are my other favorites. <3
when I hit menu and go into the wireless settings it just shows me "find network" and "automatically choose network"
as in 3g networks
hmm
strange

there shouldbe an option to skip it

I'm just waiting for Tron 2's soundtrack.

isn't bromine a nonmetal?
I know it's found in iron ores and stuff

Yeah, but its melting point is room temperature-ish.

I think my favorite element though

is technetium.
it's like
cooool
For just no reason.
XD
like, there's WAY more dense elements that still have stable isotopes
but technetium is like "yeah whatever :|"
as if nature doesn't like the number 43 or something lol
lol

isn't alpha radiation just electrons?
no
helium nucleuses, i believe
ah, then I have it backwards. lol
beta radiation is the electrons
yeah
some elements decay so quickly when created it's sad
really. :'(

Tc-99 should be my new gaming moniker.

Bohrium

:'(
lol :(
Poor Bohr.
Never stood a chance.
and it's named after one of the most important guys in all of chemistry
created the bohr model that I used all the time.
irony ftw. lol
XD
worse
its WAY more stable
then it's suceeding elements
*succeeding
lol
I heard some isotopes have half-lives of like, a few milliseconds maybe. rofl
Of the synthetic elements.
typos
ugh
oh yeah
that's what I was talking about
that's why you can discover prolly thousands upon thousands of isotopes/elements
and have it not mean much
lol inorite
It's like
since the more elections you add, and the more you add to the nucleus
some guys out there are just making elements for the heck of it.
the less and less it will last
XD
They're sitting at expensive computers
operating their atom smashers
nerds.
the lot of them.
taking really big atoms and fusing them with other really big atoms
and making a bigger one
just long enough to say it existed

Good for them, I hope they create some neutrinos that could potientally INTERACT WITH REAL MATTER AND DESTROY US ALL UGH NOOOOOO
lol neutrinos
they are amazing
I really have to wonder what the point is for making synthetic elements lol
I should make an element
that breaks down before it's even made. XD
rofl
a half life of -9.8 seconds
Well better hurry, or the guys at CERN will beat you to it. XD
Too late. :(
They've already made MendelBohorCopernicusium
that lasts exactly 3.2 X 10 ^-4444444 seconds
XD
too bad, I had some hope there
Add one more proton and name it something else.
That's what they've been doing lol
Or neutron, and make a new isotope. XD
But then it's still considered the same element :(
i know
but it would last even LESS
which is why its so amazing
lol
8)
I'm a nerd with tons of money and something to prove
so, I'll make all the elements I want
I'm just a nerd, so you've got me beat there. rofl
and be my own master.
True story. :P
I was being facetious about the money thing XD
but if I did have all the money i could want
rofl
i would just start disspointing aspiring scientists
I'd pay for college XD;
by constantly raising the bar
and crushing their hopes and dreams
you know
I'd want my own space program too.
ethical goals with no conflict of interest. :D
F*cking black holes, how do they work?
lol, yes
I'd have someone check on my crack theories.
I know how they work, but I were to actually explain it to you, it'd take a few decades
like how black holes aren't really holes in the universe and there's no such thing as an event horizon.
literally. @_@
true
they aren't holes
they are collasped stars with practically infinite density
My theory is that the speed of light inside a black hole is different from the speed of light in zero gravity.
:D
So there is no real "point of no return"
since it's already been proven that black holes emit energy and even lose mass.
so it's like
if the escape velocity is greater than the speed of light, then how fast does stuff go once it's in there?
well
anything with mass that starts to approach the speed of light
My guess is it still moves at the speed of light, but the speed of light changes because of the spacetime dilation.
would become heavier and heavier, and denser
but light itself inside a black hole, I'm not sure
02oh well, Im tired now

We will be nerds without you. lol
lol, yeah.
02good night kosovo
Something interesting too:
There IS a solution to division by zero
I'm pretty sure the speed of light must change inside a black hole, because the black hole distorts space, and whenever space is distorted, time is distorted too.
it's just that it's like saying you can solve for a negative radical
02WAT?
So any measure of speed as a function of distance over time must be super relative.
Yep, that's prolly it
time is a dimension
so it can be distorted
And yes ray
it's technically infinity
But infinity isn't a number so :(
but anything can become finite if you are an ultra genius. :P
well
8 + 5i isn't a number either. :P
but it's a solution
if an imaginary one
lol, true
then again
but some super genius has defined i for us
and no one's done that yet for 1/0 :(
Well
i itself is generally defined as the radical of negative one, or i^2=-1
but i isn't a real number, obviously
much like infinity isn't.
oo
But any operation on infinity is infinity, whereas you can still perform operations on i.

And get something that's not i, I mean.
like i^2 or i^4
True, I was just gonna say. lol
lol
well, those come out to real numbers
like
!voice
Dang it.
if you took -50^1/2
you could simplify it
using both real and imaginary numbers
I guess inf/inf could evaluate to 1, but inf * inf would be like lolwut.
same with something like (-7^1/2 X 4)(-8^1/2 X -8) is
-is
lol, true
I don't think inf X inf would be possible. XD
rofl yeah
or inf/inf for that matter
plus it could lead to some weird stuff.
Like, if inf * x would evaluate to inf, where x is any given number
you could divide both sides by inf and get x = 1.
Which I'm pretty sure would blow up the universe.
that's the problem, I don't think you can divide by infinity
XD
rofl
even with itself
since
infinity has no exact value
it's just the largest possible number imaginable
The largest possible number, factorial. XD;
then again, mabye
LOL
factorial FTW
seriously
like
just writing 240! creates an UNGODLY number
but like
I think my calculator overflows at like 70! rofl
5 X 10^5555 ! is prolly like infinity in itself. XD
Which is exactly why infinity can't be defined, lol :(
'Cause no matter how big the number is, you can always add 1.
or divide by 1. XD
or multiply by 1.
Unless you're a 32-bit CPU and can't count higher than 4294967295.
now I'm just spewing basic algebraic properties, lol
lol
XD
supercomputers that can perform trillions of calculations per second
still can't even get close to factorial
lol, yeah
let alone GRAHAM's NUMBER. XD
XD
THAT is a beast, man.
I honestly can't even read Graham's number XD
it's a number so big they had to come up with a new writing system for it.
you can't, because it is so large it literally can't be written.
lol yeah
not even using exponents raised to exponents
the most you can do
is list the ten digits or something. XD
lol yeah
And the up arrows.
it's like
"yeah, take this number and make it bigger. Then make it bigger again."
that's all I get out of it lol
I can't even comprehend that system. O_Oo
the best i can do is exponents raised to exponents, lol
same here, hence why I can't read it. lol
All I see is arrows.
but again, it's so large that system is useless
Graham's number is awesome
googol doesn't even cut it
googol is like nothing lol
it shivers before grahams number
10^10, lol
Googol is like nothing next to Graham's number
Child's play
yeah
Even Googolplex is nothing
even like 344353453453453! is nothing
10^googol
Even everything is nothing on Graham's number.
It's probably as close to infinity as we've gotten lol
not even
our universe is so pathetic
Indeed
when we think of numbers like googol
that
I can't think of any quantity in the universe
of like
ANYTHING
Only my hatred of the military is larger than Graham's Number
that equals googol
even the amount of atoms that exist
The amount of atoms observable, at least. lol
not counting neutrinos and stuff, lol
Atoms plus other stuff.
and antimatter/dark matter, i guess
lol yeah
Things that aren't atoms.
by a magnitude so large Graham's Number itself could look smaller than something of a Planck's volume
Wonder how many neutrinos are in the universe.

Maybe those can compare to G's number then. lol
"Every second, about 65 billion solar neutrinos pass through every square centimeter on the part of the Earth that faces the Sun."
o.o
O_o
65 billion ONLY?
Apparently. lol
I could have expected a Graham's Number of them passing through a Planck's Volume of the part of Earth that faces the Sun
...what
Maybe that might tear apart the universe
I love you, Cone
you do your patriotic duty
Uh, Cone doesn't link *every* new post on the forums now, does it? .-.
to update us on every new post
yes
apparently it does now XD
I'm already sick of it lol
Bed soon
lol
it is interrupting our nerdular nerdence.
It's like double the pain
spam the fourms
and you spam the chat too, lol
inb4 destruction of both. XD
we should not let cone disturb our nerdy discussion. XD
lol
but anyway
like
log (-1)
=best expression ever
lol
I've never really thought about what my favorite expression would be.
/me ponders
Sigma's a cool looking operator. lol
I pretty much like anything with that in it.
lol yeah
how about e
e gets no love. D:
no one ever talks about it
e or Euler's number? :(
I always get those mixed up lol
yes, i think
where e is about 2.71
ah, that one.
where when written as log base e or LN
I never learned much about logs, so I don't work with e too much :(
it is the natural logarithm
All I know is that like, every other digit is an 8. lol
Oh wait, the other one is Euler's *constant*.
because having two different things named Euler's number and Euler's constant isn't confusing at all.
:|
whats up
...
anyone on?
lol
Logarithms are awesome.
.....
:/
Especially about condensing/expanding them
The only experience I have with them is with bit calculations. lol
And even then I didn't know it was a logarithm.
like you can write log3 (x+1) - log3 (y-8) as log3 (x+1/y-8)
and that's the extremely simple example, lol
I think it was b = log(n-1), where n is the highest number you can represent with b bits.
Or I'm probably mixing that up somehow because I never really learned it XD
...yeah according to my calculator I'm like ass wrong on that. lol
XD
calculators can be totally retarded sometimes, lol
uhmmm...
Well I know all the powers of 2 up to 10 by heart, so whatev. lol
:s
bogus domain errors out the ass all the time. XD
That should be as high as I need to go without some kind of tool.
At which point I can just do 2^n or something.
I like how most of the math I know is related only to programming. lol
I need to learn some l33t programming skills from you, lol.
I aim to either compose music for games or be a history professor
so
rofl
Do you play any instruments?
not particularly, besides like a harmonica and clarinent, lol
rofl
That's one more instrument than me XD
I can play the piano to some degree, but only because it's a lot like typing. rofl
or rather, I think of it like typing.
Being an audio programmer could be something else I could get into, so maybe you can come and work with me then =P
I have a friend who can program wiimotes and I've heard Kinect is pretty easy to wire into a program too.
XD
am i the only one on?
Hmm ... Is anyone here?
that's awesome
whats up
physics?
Hey.
like a phsyics engine in a game or phsysics in general?
Only physics as it relates to games, mind you XD
are you a Spyro fan?
Just playin' around with an Xbox Arcade Indy game.
ah
Yes, I am.
I love Spyro.
NICE almost everyone on this site hardly is
Yeah.
I don't get why, though.
i k now right
Still way more advanced than what I did in high school, but probably not too similar to physics at a regular college.
This is called "SpyroChat
"
haha yeah
RK4 integration and stuff.
oh so you got an Xbox?
Yes, I do.
nice
also RK4 is like my favorite name for a formula ever.
I love these things.
what things?
Xbox 360
oh
Sorry man.
about what?
The confusion.
oh
ha dont trip
I won't
anyway iv got a PS3 and please dont mistake me for a fanboy
I just ate a big block of cheese. I'm happy, heheh.
lol
Aah, a PS3.
nice i just got home from walmart
your high school must have had actual options.
lol you dont like ps3s?
unlike mine.
Do you play it?
yeah
Mine has been rendered absolutely pathetic by budget cuts
from time to time im sometimes bussy
Alright.
right now im kinda working but im almost done
even core academic classes are being cut. :/
so i think ima finish up tommarow
Working where?
let alone classes for, like programming
*like,
Or is it school related?
i make invatations
lol :(
Sweet.
Doesn't mean I didn't hate high school lol
yeah the pay isnt amazing but it gets me by
What's your age?
18
In fact I think I hated it because it was too easy.
You should be fine, then.
*mean
Wow, I need to update my age on my profile.
yeah for a while im about to turn 19
how old r u?
It says 17[3/4] years old. I'm 19.
nice
I meant actually being able to start attaining skills for a career in high school
when ur birthday?
I haven't updated my profile in about 1.25 years.
That I didn't do at all XD
dang
and yeah, high school is too easy for the most part. lol :/
Sep. 9th
9-9-91
My high school(s) were like, soooo boringly easy and pointless.
oh so you just turned
ha thats kinda tipy
ABout 3 months ago, yes.
Most everything I learned during those four years I was just learning on my own time. lol
ima turn on april 4th
That's an odd date.
y?
'Cause I sure as heck didn't spend that time doing homework. XD
April fools jokes would hit you like a hammer.
.'/
ha
sometimes not always
Great.
lol
what?
College is cool and I'm actually kinda sad that I'm almost done. lol :(
That would suck having your birthday while everyone keeps making those stupid jokes.
:/
I know this is unrelated with regards to education
haha i dont mind Im a pretty strong guy people dont really like to mess with me so its cool
but is the college atmosphere the same as high school?
God no. XD
Not this college, that's for sure at least.
Oh, alright.
The people here have personality, for one thing.
yeah, so im just wondering for the sake of asking, How big of a spyro fan are you?
I'm going to update my profile in a second.
How big?
ight
I've loved Spyro and the Spyro games since I was 9.
yeah like- kinda/big fan/EXTREAM
I began playing them when I was 8 or 9.
We don't have those annoying one-armed desks either.
Extreme.
I hated those.
ha same here i played Spyro from a demo Pizza hut gave out
I guess you could say.
...and still do lol
nice same here i just dont like the 1st ps2 spyro games
My first Spyro game is Spyro: Year of the Dragon. I torrented Spyro 1 and 2 earlier this year.
lol
because
like
bbl
oh
So you like the "The Legend of Spyro" series?
if people in college developed that same stupid-as-hell social ladder that exists in high school
then I wouldn't even bother
Yeah i dont hate it, i like the story... kinda
i think i could have written a better story and made a better gameplay enviornment
Then what's your favorite Spyro game?
There's still a bit of a social ladder here, but it's more like
if you're smart enough to know it's there, you're probably at the top of it.
spyro year of the dragon and Spyro Eternal Night
Aah, yes.
This Broken Soul is a beautiful song.
From The Eternal Night's ending credits.
YEAH
It's a law of the universe that there's always "that guy" wherever you go, but it's a lot easier to put up with idiots when you're around more people who aren't idiots.
i got it on my ps3
true.
Even the teachers here aren't all that much different from the students.
If it was released on Xbox Original, I would play it more often, but the only console it is on that my family owns is the Wii. I really don't like Wiis.
You can talk to them and joke around with them just like anyone else.
haha i understand not liking the wii
So I play it every once in a while.
lol, I'd always imagine my professors being these strict old white man that are all stiff and have a long cane to smack people in the face with. XD
rofl, not at this school XD
But that's cool that you had professors that were relatable
yeah i got Spyro 1 2 and 3 for the ps1 on the ps3
In fact only one of my teachers was even over 50.
Sweet.
Most are probably in their 30s or younger.
Wow, really? O_o
Really XD
had it on my psp but i cant play games while i am moving i get sick
I play them on my laptop using an outstanding program called ePSXe, which is pretty much a PS1 console on your computer.
You seriously can't spot them in a crowd.
That's the age range at my school for the most part actually
but in a college?...I didn't expect that. O_o
i bet you need some kind of gaming computer or a high tec computer
So I play all of my PS1 games using it.
If it weren't for the color of their lanyards, they'd blend in perfectly with the students.
for teachers, i mean
I don't.
then what do you use?
i got a toshiba Laptop so i dought i can use it
Heck, some of the supervisors there *are* students XD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8v7UOXxF0c&feature=related
lol
that was how i got my 1st spyro
that sounds like a very well blended community to me
where people are easily relatable to one another
regardless of age/position
yeah, it's awesome here.
That's basically my dream college, lol
Like, one of my teachers this month just reformatted his computer
I have a Dell laptop with an i3 Processor. Not sure how much RAM it has.
and then the class had a nice discussion over what he should have installed first, Minecraft or WoW.
its cool i dont get a tec into computers anyway
just photoshop
"Embedding disabled by request."
Like, before he even installed his work software or an antivirus.
He installed Minecraft.
aww wack
XD
Wow
that is awesome.
like
I can't imagine my spanish teacher EVER doing that. XD
*past
rofl
I clicked "Pop Out" and I got to watch it.
Sweet, it's Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage.
yea
Well
And Tetris.
Awesome.
I love my school and all
in terms of hertiage and blah blah
I don't think any of my high school teachers even played games.
How old were you when you first got your Spyro game?
but the atmosphere sucks
and so do a lot of the people. :/
not sure
lol :(
Oh, alright.
I know you live in Florida and all
but
Wait ... are you in the British Isles?
When people say there are budget cuts in californian schools
they MEAN it to the highest degree
Oh, so it's night time.
D:
I should know, I'm in our school's asb.
Alright.
yeah its 10:37
I take part in managing our fiances and whatnot.
It's 12:37 AM here in Texas.
ah :(
We have almost nothing to work with, at all. :/
TX??/!!! WHAT PART
??
!!
a lot of the money actuallly comes from our own pockets
What? ... What state are you in?
fail D:
yeah
Ca but i used to live in HOUSTON TX
it's that bad
Oh.
I'm about 2 hours SouthWest.
like
i also lived in Tomball tx
San Antonio.
it's part of the reason why people nowadays don't even care. :/
the droppout rate is increasing rapidly
I'd imagine so lol :(
I never got involved with anything in grade school because I never cared enough.
iv been there i was in citywalk, when to sea world and saw the alamo
I never felt like school was doing anything for me.
its dope
yeah
same here
Granted I didn't drop out, but I did hate it enough to want to. lol
all of them
i move... ALOT
but i love the City most then Country
What I mean is, whixh do you like most?
Aah, okay.
and you??
D:
In fact
just today, we were totally yelled at in our asb period
I'm a naturalist. I love being around nature.
ha same i hate country (besides Johny Chase's song Wont Back Down)
And Cration.
because we had an event on saturday where a lot of our staff left early
because they were fed up
yeah i like nature but i also know it has a deadly side and i can never keep that out of my head
XD :(
that's awesomely horrible lol
lol, yeah.
Yes, true. But if you know where to go, it's very nice.
the president herself even started crying over it
and she blamed us for the whole school's problems
or at least partly
lol
Not like you'd hop onto a raft and chill out in an alligator-infested swamp.
I know what kind of job I don't want lol :(
haha i have (believe it or not) IN SAN ANTONIO
no joke complete accident
12switching to DSi
same, but I'm in this job, and I gotta commit to it. lol
12BBLs
12<again>
not raft tho it was a cano
You can try coming to this college XD
XD
i will
when i get the money to move to the other side of the country. XD
That's the spirit 8D
Oh, I was getting worried.
ha
Sorry I had a late reply. I just finished installing a mod for my PC game.
:B
oh
It was in three separate parts for its installation. Three separate downloads.
or I can move to, like, nepal
They took about an hour + each to download for that one mod.
and learn yoga
and meditate for the rest of my life
lol
but nah
DANG Mod for what game?
sounds boring :P
Or you could just find a place in your town that teaches it :(
Battlefield 1942.
oh neverplayed it
do you know how to hack COD: MW2
?
In the city I live in, there are TONS of yoga classes/centers
First file was 1.3 Gig, second was 899 Mega, and third was about 1.2 Gig
I just don't wanna spend the money. XD
/me hates Call of Duty.
rofl, fair enough.
I can just use Thisgamesux to hack it if I wanted to.
/me back
/me thinks its alright and is guessing you hate COD because of Activision
wb LL
I did actually want to get back into martial arts sometime.
Not because of Activision.
tys
and o-o
Since the most exercise I get nowadays is carrying groceries to my house XD;
servers? lack of creativity?
perks?
I know tae known doe myself. :B
I've played it and clocked many hours of gameplay in them before figuring out that I hate them.
I'm a brown belt.
/me lols
haha same here
Never got to white or black, lol
CoD 2, 3, 4, and 6.
I never got past green. XD
i dont hate them i just think that its not all that good
*kwon
XD
wb kipi
Cod:MW- WAW- MW2-Black ops
I dabbled in tang soo do at one point too.
'lo, Kosovo.
And hap ki do.
and like a ton of other things
but never got far XD
Think of it this way [and this is a small reason I don't like them]: They have terrible servers, they have too many glitches, and they are too easy to hack into.
BLACK ops is the best because if all the customs
/me growls
XD
it froze
on me 2 times
>>;
anyway
Just being a yellow belt proves you've tried, at least.
idk how to hack into it but i heard its easyer to hack into it on Xbox360
I'm a black-belt
but
... But I do like the Zombies mode.
physically weak oxo
My muscles get all tight now because I don't practice.
the worst we get is elevating
lol
i suck at Zombies
I'm flexible tho~
I actually USED my tae kwon do knowledge once.
Wellm skilled or not, it could be quite fun. But I enjoy Halo's "Flood" more.
I can kick about as high as my face but that's it. lol
It was hilarious/terrifying
I punched a guy once, it was just hilarious.
you got halo Reach?
Yes.
I was actually being pinned down in this alley
Me and my friend play that game alot
and when I was able to break free
/me ...
It's a great game, other than the Matchmaking.
one
last
I side kicked a guy in the face. XD
chance
im alright but if i dont constantly play i get rusty fast
rofl :(
/me o-o
Indeed.
I agree.
I always carry a knife when I go out.
I think I saw blood.
I got bruises every night
I was @karate
Never seen him again
lol
its cool but i hate how only the alians can dodge row
I had no idea why he pinned me down in the first place, lol
Well, that's what martial arts are for :D
row?
maybe it was because he wanted my groceries. XD
rofl
if they had that spartens should have also had an exclusive
evade
yams are pretty valuable
Oh.
hey, muggers need to eat too :P
yams are awesome.
true.
YES.
Elites had evade since Halo 1.
Yams=best thing ever
Heck, I'd mug a guy in a back alley for a bag of yams.
lol
It's part of their character and personality.
Spartans just run in with guns blazing.
lol
yeah but what do the spartens have that elites dont?
Very fast bullets.
elites can do that too
elites can take human weapons
Excluding the Needle Rifle.
I'm making canolis tomorrow
(love that gun)
for fun. :B
*cannolis
:o
I'm gonna try my hand at mochi again once I get the proper tools.
do you play FallOut: New Vegas?
ie, cheese cloth and a real mortar and pestle.
I think Spartans just have more brute force, but I have always like elites more.
or FallOut: 3
XD
No, sorry.
But i do like them.
Mortar and pestle=epic
WHAT!!!!!???
FALLOUT FTW!!!
Even if I fail at it, those things make a heck of a kitchen ornament.
I have watched my friend play them quite a few times, and have played it myself a few times.
like "check me out, I have a f*cking MORTAR AND PESTLE because I'm such a gangsta."
its diffrent when its your game tho
XD
Yes, it is.
I should tell that to the gangs that live in my neighborhood, lol.
I like how Fallout NV provides iron sights for weapons.
i got my fallout New Vegas with the Limited Edition box
rofl
"Hey, motherf******s"
"What?"
"guess what I got?"
yeah FallOut 3 didnt have that
"What?"
real useful
"A MOTHERF****** MORTAR AND PESTLE."
SH*T JUST GOT REAL
God forbid rice gets involved
anyway so your 19, how many fights have you been in?
Rice is awesoooome.
THEN sh*t gets escalated man
again just asking for the sake of asking
lol, so true.
I wonder what happens if I try to grind white rice instead of mochi rice.
Theoretically it should still taste like rice.
I frown upon people who fight. But to answer your question, I was dragged into about three in my life.
All in middle school.
theoretically, of course.
oh, i used to be a real big fighter (not my choice)
We all know how theories end up working out. lol
I have better, more productive things to do with my life then to waste time fighting people.
lol
you never know. :o
Theoretically I should have been able to grind rice with my hands. XD
ouch that hurt lol
I did NOT know what I was up against there. XD
Not to be mean to you.
You cannot deny the rice.
It will only deny you.
The above statement is true.
XD
wana at least know what drove me to be a fighter?
Some people grow up in an environment like that. I feel bad for those people.
I was denied by the rice
Sure, I'll listen.
it asserted its authority over me and I was powerless to resist.
well i was born in San Branidino CA
lived in the getto then moved to Fontana Lived in the not so getto
But, it was a fierce and delicious struggle.
indeed
if resistance was actually possible
[read]
but when i turned to a teen ager i moved to tombal tx
the rice would have to take sh*t into it's own hands. :/
but it doesnt have to.
its own very sticky and pasty hands.
indeed.
thats when i was introduced to Racism
Oh, alright.
I wonder if you could make glue out of that stuff.
white people where the majority they hated me
Possibly, lol.
black people hated me
I know you can probably make chaulk out of it. XD
I should order a larger bag of it next time and play around with it more. lol
and on the 1st day of school i got in a fight with a popular Mexican so Hispanics HATED me
lol
That's terrible.
Two pounds just isn't enough it seems.
yeah sucked
Nope.
So what is it like now?
You need a googol amount of it.
anyway my parents broke up and i moved
in kilograms.
to Houston Tx
Is your life better now?
yeah
More stuff needs to be measured in SI units :\
in Houston the majorty of people where Black
That's nice at least.
XD
Yes, it's like that.
they had a gang or click
nope
Nope?
I only think of things using customary units, even when I know the metric system. lol
to get in you had to Jump a lot of mexicans or stab 1 mexican to get in
miles>kilometers in my brain
My skin color made me a target
lol
You didn't try to get in, did you?
Oh.
sorry for cutting off short
Well, miles > kilometers in a mathematical sense too =P
true, actually XD
but it was my homie puff that got stabed
Did he live?
I gotta get some sleep. It's getting late here. @_@
thats what opend my eyes even more to my hostal contentment
lol :(
envornment
and I have to get to school earlier than usually tomorrow...so... XD
not contentment
lol, I can relate
School sucks, honestly.
for the most part
High school yeah D:
It would do the same for me. I would probably just leave that place.
well, g'night bromine o/
lol
so i always jumped people who put red cloths on and i was jumped and nearly stabed many times
/me shot
XDDDDDDDDDDDD
I will remember to use that IRL
that is hilarious
rofl
Thank God you never got stabbed.
my homies and me always stuck close to one another
Yeah.
i know right :)
night lol
so other Hispanics started to want to get in our group
soon we became known and people started to Say that Me my homie puff and my other homie Chito where the HEADS of this Click
Of that gang?
man word gets by quick in the streets let me tell you that
not a gang
or at least i didnt mean to make one
That sucks.
yeah
the worst part was when i was going out with my 1st love
Diana
she was everything to me
Because you're 18, are you in college, out of school, or still in Senipr High
?
im in HS
Okay.
Back to what oyu were saying?
So Diana became a BIG target (i didnt know)
and those low life scum actually put their hands on them
her not them
sorry im getting emotional and my typing starts to l suk
Get the gun.
didnt have one
but that does come into play later
Take your time, brother.
i looked at her... i saw the mess they made out of someone i truly cared about
the blood falling from hur eye
No ... .'/
the anger that manifested in side me was uncontrollable
the next day i was at the park (Crying so know one sees me at home)
and i saw a black guy wearing red.
he started to call out soowoo (their gang word or something)
i turned to him and he reconized me even tho p i had vever seen him in my life
.'/
he pulled a knife on me but he was holding it wrong so i knocked it out of his hand before he got a good grip on it
i beat the living shit out of im
: )
hitting him on the head on the same spot for what felt like hours
i thought he was dead he stoped moving
It's wrong to take revenge on someone, but I understand your feelings and what caused you to do that.
he didnt even straggle anymore
i dragged him to a ditch and left him there, i didnt hear about it, but i still asumed he was dead
i was scared out of my mind thinking every cop as out looking for me
but he lived it was just my mind pushing my worst fear
He may have been found by his friends.
yeah he was...
weeks later
Now I'm worried again.
i was walking down the same park to go home
late at night might i add
... even worse.
with my younger brother
we had just left a little party with my homies
but the park is still kind of far. so anyway we saw a car pass by we didnt think much about it untill it stopped
I'd be runnung.
*running
when in turned the corner and drove slowly
then not when
the passenger shot at us
me and my brother got low laying down taking cover from some hills
i thought the bullet was going to go through the grass like butter and kill me but it didnt
as soon as the driver drove away i told my brother to run and call the homies, i didnt need to tell him twice
They must've been 9mm rounds.
i got up and ran the other direcition
they followed me took a few other shots and got out of they car
(im guessing they ran out of ammo
)
They could have ...
i was so enraged i turned around and started fighting the closest one
i should have thought about it, but i didnt
It's hard to think in a situation like that. I know I wouldn't be able to./
I might have died.
i soon found my self out numbered my body on the hard street
they all took shots at my jaw and ribs
(my jaw is still messed up and pops out of place from time to time)
my ribs werent broken but they felt like they where
Internal bruising.
Lucky for my my brother showed up with my homies
yeah i had that
as soon as those chicken shits saw a truck full of mexicans they got in their car and left
my friends came to my aid
took me to a hospital and everything
the doc said my jaw was dislocated and my ribs had internal bleeding
Crap.
oh and something hit my right eye
What?
so i was blind from my right eye for about 3 weeks
Was it bleeding?
ha i was soo f'ed up That the doc said
" you might be perminatly blind from your right eye"
my responce was
"aww shit for how long?
I'm just glad they didn't shoot you ... the gang.
yeah i think thats what hit my eye, not the bullet but maybe the bullet hit the floor and some concret or something hit my eye
Was it automatic or semi-auto?
[the weapon]
it was a pistol 9mm im sure cuz it wasnt so loud when the shots fired
Oh.
anyone still here
yo
but i didnt get a good look at the gun i just saw that it was black
Where was your family during all of this?
oh hi
what's up
home
Great.
bleh
essay
you?
I'm sicker than ever
my mom found out about the shotting cuz of the hospital bill
I was throwing up all morning and now I keep getting too warm and I'm afraid to eat and I'm still coughing from bronchitis
That's what I figured.
so
and she moved me out to Ontario Ca with my sister
yeah
To a safer place.
D:
yeah way safer but i wasnt in my envornment any more
I'm glad you got moved out of there, personally.
thanks
and as weired or stupid as it sounds...
Who knows ... you could have holes in you right now ...
i still want to go back
What do you miss?
my friends... they where like brothers to me...
It's such a hard life to live, though.
and revenge is another thing on my list... Mexicans out there still getting gutted for that stupid gang
Wow.
I understand.
life is hard but i always felt i had a warrior inside of me, and this warrior wants blood through sweet revenge no matter what the coast is
but my vision is starting to fade the warrior is dying im starting to make a new life...
as hard as it is to admit im not the same person, im not as strong, im not as fast and i dont know much about the Houston Streets anymore
Maybe that's a good thing.
i just get updated by my homie chito everytime someone dies.
a goodthing, im not even sure what that is anymore
after what happend to Diana im to scared to love anyone anymore
2 or 3 years now... but im starting to get over it
slowly the wound heals
I hope you don't mind me sharing this.
Hold a sec ...
alright
http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205:38-42&version=NLT
There's always Forgiveness, though.
and i knew you would give the the word of the bible
Is that a bad thing?
nope
Oh.
Sweet.
Indeed.
but its something i TRULY need
what is?
Jesus
i used to say "im not Jesus i wont forgive"
but i am his follower
I hear you. I have thought that before. I've hated someone, unfortunately.
But decide to let it go.
good
yeah and I had a prescription for the medicine last week but it didn't work so now I have to see the doctor again tomorrow ughh
I've put saws up to people's neck. It's not something to enjoy talking about.
i still live with guilt and it feels bad to pray knowing i hate and as for GOD to forgive me
have you killed?
In my head, yes. In the material world, I'm glad I have not.
Here's something I am glad about:
I grew up in a family of worship leaders.
Nice
I was [and still am] an Introvert, so I kept all of my feelings inside of me.
I went to public school my whole life until high school.
I have one sibling, a sister. She joined her first worship band in her high school year before I joined my first band.
in elementary school,
I was a nerdy kid who never got respect and had only two friends. They have been my friends since they were born.
Middle school, I was just a normal kid who cursed in every sentence.
i think we all go through that stage
Yeah.
High School was when my life began to turn around.
Crap, forgot.
When I was young, My best friend was Spyro.
Anyway ...
.'/
I joined my private school's worship band.
what spyro was my friend to and so was Crash and Later on Jak and Dexter
I got my first guitar when my grandfather died from a stroke. He passed it on. It's an old Gibson from the early '70s.
Dang!
So I decided to learn guitar. I eventually joined the youth band and the Sunday worship band that plays for the main service.
So I was in three worship bands until I graduated high school and left the school band.
I plan on going to college and becoming a worship pastor or something related to that.
nice
My sister grew up with me as my role model.
She was always showing me how to be nicer to people.
well I'm gonna try and attempt to sleep so seeya
She would hit me, I would hit her, and she would be the one that gets in trouble.
Wait ... I was the one that enjoyed hitting her. Crap.
jst askin but is ur sister still alive?
/me can't think straight
Yes.
She's 20
/me understands
My main point ...
She began dating my friend's brother a few months back, then about two weeks ago found that she was pregnant.
:S
:s
My parents and I then found out that most of her relationship was a sexual relationship. Not only do I distrust her now, but I lost my role model.
dang
So she's officially stupid ... heh.
that sucks
She had a miscarriage.
Never have i been in any situation like that with family
NO...
Apparently.
She was bleeding a lot last week.
do you think it was a miscarriage?
Then found out that she had a miscarriage. I think God said to her, "Oh, no. It's not your time yet."
yeah pregnacy makes people vonarable
Heheh.
how many mounts was she in?
My mother was scared, though. She told me that my sister could have serious pregnancy issues the first three weeks of pregnancy. So I am somewhat glad it was a miscarriage.
Mounts?
im guessing around 3-5
yeah
What do you mean?
how many mounts was your sister pregnet?
Not sure. All I know is that she got prego and lost the baby.
dang that sucks...
She's fine now. She's working as a baby-sitter and going to college to later become a math teacher.
oh
Yeah.
Math Teacher :(
i dislike mather teachers....
lol
On a side note, I plan on buying myself a Springfield Armory M14 or M1A rifle when I move out. But I've been planning on that before the whole deal with my sister.
i want a shotgun
any shotgun will do
Why not a rifle? they pack more of a punch.
i like to get close and personal and on top of that its better for a house
True.
dude i got to get some sleep i got school tomarrow
Remington makes reliable 12-guages.
(school sucks)
Remington is a GOOD gun brand
You need to get some sleep. Thanks for sharing your story. I'm glad to hear that you are fine now.
I need sleep too.
I have nothing to do tomorrow.
: )
alright then man, and thank you for letting me in on your life
It's what I do, brother.
oh btw i get in this chat room often,
NOT always but i do from time to time
I have not been here in a few weeks. Something was telling me to get on.
Or someone.
Anyway, good night.
yeah maybe
L8er

http://www.orientalmodelbuses.co.uk/Xtra/Other-HK-NLB-YoungMan.htm <- WTF A bus manufacturer called Young Man
China is fail
What's next?
A train manufacturing company called Old Woman?
eXALR: I agree with you to that
/me hides
china is definitely full of fail
:DD
yay
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEpeDoO5KvM&feature=related 1:05 <- BULLSHIT
You know
yup?
SMRT recently tried out a China-made bus
omg
seriously?
But then things kinda failed
ah, okay.,
Bus drivers hated it I hear
believe me, China things always fail
So they send it packing
BUT
thats good. :)
yeah?
They are buying 30 more supposedly
a different brand though
They are, insane
/me pets Ray. ^^
I won't bet on them lasting more than a year before they melt
Here's how they look like, so you can avoid them:

BEWARE
okay
Why?
Coming soon to a bus stop near you
oh, these fail buses
A bus that is made from fail
I'm NEVER GOING TO sit on one of them
eva
Why?
Lead-paint
Poor-quality plastic
Glass that scratches easily
Lead paint feels good on the skin.
Engines that will die randomly for no reason
It's a healthy aternative to lotion.
air-conditioning that blows poisonous air that is worse than Koffing's toxic gas
It's...
lol, good one
A CHINA BUS
/me RUNS
China=FAIL
:D
I don't understand
Even India is BETTARU
/me hides
hell yeah, I agree. anything beats China
Sadly, yes
yeah
You know, I don't know if you seen them before but in the early 1990's, it was all European and Japanese buses
And we all know
Japan > China
I second that
you shouldnt even be comparing Japan to a piece of crap country with crap people living in it. :o
Well, not all of them are crap
MOST of them
well, to me they all are crap
I pity the few who aren't
who cares about em. :D

These Japanese buses were win back in those days
There were both air-conditioned and non-air-conditioned versions
Old-fashioned, but reliable

I recognise that
But I have met a LOT of them who are fail

I see that the biggest problems with China are
1. They steal, but don't innovate
2. They are generally lazy leeches
3. They have no qualms in harming the environment...
4. ...and supporting tyrant regimes like Burma's
truely, they deserve to be annihilated, every single one of em
Ancient China was OK-awesome
I don't think they need to be destroyed
But rather
then? o.o
relearn their old ways
and from Taiwan and Hong Kong
their too lazy too, I believe

Taiwan, not quite
Hong Kong too

/me runs
You're supposed to kill someone while hiding in a haystack
/me points out that's because volcanic ash is maintained at a much higher temperature and exposed to heat longer than regular ash, making it more dangerous
But to do that you're supposed to wait in one spot till your target comes
and hope someone hunting you doesn't come first.
02wb Angel
Isn't that what you're able to produce?
And even if your target comes, they have to be right next to the haystack

02i have seen that, but how does that works?
I need the codes though
Where do I get the codes?
You can find lots background codes if you type in "myspce backgrounds" on your search provider
*myspace
/me 7is back.
kk
Thanks :D
Wb Quan btw
After you find a code to a background you like, just copy and past it to "Customization:"
The code of course
7Apparently, Beiber is a whale.
7*random find from TV Tropes*
I will see if I can find you a good website for codes
/me makes a fishie
You poked too hard!
:O
Ebil.
?
anyone here with some knowledge about irc?
12where he goes YAYYYYYYYYYYYY Ipods
12or whatever
/me has knowledge about inspircd >.>
curly,
i have a question
yes?
i am running mIRC on my server running windows 7
and i have xBOT on it
as a script
ok?
you might want to talk to Ari about server issues
it keeps saying: ping timeout
its not the server
ping timeout means the internet's disconnected
yeah
but its not
12http://notalwaysright.com/an-open-and-shut-case-2/8891
12...
!ew ipods
10EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW IPODS
the internet is fine
:]
http://notalwaysright.com/an-open-and-shut-case-2/8891
it's just your bot that d/cs like that?
ChainSaw?
wait
what do you mean?
i dont know much about this
um, what's timing out?
the bot
d/c means disconnect
then yeah
and its on the same connection
I don't suppose your timeout duration is shorter than normal is it?
nope
120 s
it went once to 121
you wanna take a look?
I'm not sure if I can think of anything that could cause that issue ._.;
other than like
an unstable router
are you hosting the bot on the same computer?
linksys E3000 running latest version of DD-WRT
no
different computer
is that computer on a wireless connection or something?
yes
is yours?
yes
mine is on 5GhZ
well, I can only guess it's the wireless adapter on your bot's computer that's doing it
and the other is on 2.4
hmm
do you have team?
teamviewer*
no
would you download it for me?
(:
I don't think I could help you beyond basic stuff anyway
for networking I mean
i have an idea
hmmmm hey vulcan
its only when there is nothing going on in the channel when the bot ping timeouts
so
what i was thinking
is that
mew
14*pounces and clings to*
/me swims with Umbreon
maybe i can install another bot on that comp
12^^
and get the two constantly pinging each other
12guess ecco doesn't have much choice
/me >.<!
not really, xP
but i need a script?
otherwise
This is going to take a little more time then I thought :/
i could maybe change the ping interval?
I will pm you the site in the forums after I find you a good site for codes
that's odd, your computer should be, as far as I know, constantly sending packets
regardless of your bot
/me .... its good to see you too.....
my computer is fine
I think you'd have to ask Ari or something though
doesnt disconnect ata ll
at all
Alright Lugia
not your computer, the bot's computer
/me 14smiles and cuddles. "Heya."
Thanks :]
yeah
the bots computer
doesnt diconnect from the WAN
Well I have to leave for now so seeya ^^
aka the router
that really is odd. it could be an issue with your ports
/me *squirms to get free* whats up
what ones should be forwarded for this?
i have
/me 14releases and smiles. "Nothing much, you?"
hang on

I'm looking it up
thanks

(:*
oh right
um
oh nevermind
/me keeps looking it up
02FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF ANGEL STARR!!!!!!!
um, I have no idea which ports that would be ._.
02That witness never gives up >_<
it could be anything from 6660 to 6669 I think
but I'm not sure if that's only servers or the actual client too
you could look it up on command prompt
14Oh god. x.=.x
oh
how do i do that?
e.e
im connecting through 6667
/me ....... I was forced to since... dark absorbed several dark crystals and came to kill us........
fyi, this is a bit above my head, one moment
/me forwarded 6667
o3o
03EW THAT FACE
o3o
I don't think it's actually the default server ports that you need to forward, I'm still looking it up >.>
oh
/me lies down on the floor
um.... I'm not sure which port it is ._.
/me just tried looking into her router's configs but there was nothing special there
speaking of dark...... where is he
you should give Ari a poke later, he's sick right now though
oh

I played an Epic Mickey demo the other day
it was epic
XD
02brb foodz
How long was the demo?
It never stopped
Grrrr
The siginal is almost dead. ;.;
I had to leave before it was over
oh
Last week it was fine
but I played for a pretty long time
/me slaps dark with a sea urchin
but maybe that was because I was playing with the paint and thinner on everything
lol, that's one of the best parts of the game
is testing out the effects of paint and thinner on everything
and finding hidden unlockables and paths
yeah
so fun
I'm definately getting it now
Getting what?
/me is getting Epic Yarn
Epic Mickey, HML
Epic Mickey
Oh, that game which I haven't really paid much attention to
Rune Factory Oceans
^
I've heard of that game.
you should
Rune Factory Oceans
It's on both the PS3 and Wii in Japan I believe
yes
Heard, but never wondered
I wondered
because I'm a Harvest Moon/Rune Factory fanboy
....
I tend to like series that have their share of faults
So I'm assuming you've played Rune Factory Frontier on the Wii, then? XD
Because I actually plan on picking up that game soon
no
!Umbreon
sadly not
ah.
I don't have any Rune Factory games,yet
which is strange, me being a fanboy of it and all
lol
I've played Rune Factory 2 on the DS
it's a pretty decent rpg
but I hope to get 3, Frontier, and Oceans soon
cool
I'll have to get it as well
I plan on getting super mario all stars this sunday
I have the original on my snes
although apparently no one knows that it's coming out besides me, judging from the reactions of people I tell that to. XD
I knew it was coming out
That was one of the first games I ever played.....
02back
RAYYYYYYYYYY!
:3
ahhh memories
also SMAS had to be one of the best deals ever back then

4 games in one cartridge...unheard of at the time
OH, I have that~
4 games that were actual games that didn't suck, I mean. XD
XD, so true
wb HML
has anyone ever played lawnmower man?
having some connection issues? :/
I haven't, heard of it though
Yeah, Beach (other wireless) is acting up with a low siginal again
And I'm afraid that it has been moved slightly
it's pretty fun
I gotta go
bye everyone

So...
...how is everyone?
Good good
Just webcamming with my friends on Fb
:3
cool
I went and got a new bike today
since the gears got all messed up when i was riding it this morning
kinda messy, but after school I was able to go to wal mart and get a new bike for $85
at least now I won't have to worry about my bike for a while. XD
:o
What kind of bike is it?
mountain bike, apparently. XD
there weren't a lot of options, lol
/me hides in the rafters..
!umbreon
/me now belongs to Kosovo for 18 minutes
!pokemon
lol
Its so quiet today
D;
yep.
Quiet chats are depressing. :/
Btw
How come you can "own" people but I cant? xD
02hey kosovo, brawl later?
02:3
!ray
/me does a barrel roll and avoids ownership, nice try!
lol
Sure thing, ray. :D
You can own people, jet
you just have to own the right ones. XD
!kosovo
xD
None of them work
:(
I think the only people you can own in the chat now is umbreon, and I have him atm. >:3
wb HML
Wb Hml
:o
huh;..
What a nice week.. :|
Also, gotta type at a horrible angle to get this through
/me would say what is wrong but...
HML
I think Kefka used the light of judgement on your computer.
Yeah?
FFFFFFFF
I think you might have displeased him.
Aaaaah ;.;
I never beat the game
And now, my right arm still hurts
.__.
That's prolly why
he wants to prevent you from climbing his tower and killing him by crippling your connection. XD
Then again, if you have an snes and an snes copy of ff 6, you can avoid that problem, lol
:(
Not funny
Yeah, I'm in that of a bad mood today
I wasn't trying to be funny.
Oh.
Alrighty, then. My bad.
Oh well, it's just mostly me and my reaction to simmple 'criticism' or statements
And the mass of homework I need to do too
Homework sucks, lol.
And worrying about 'finding' a way to fix "our" DSL or internet... even when no one seems to be listening to yo
Well, try doing the "Berkeley Project" assignments without internet
And my laptop is going to die soon, but I cannot move it
:/
Oh well, better forget about my arm that my friend bit into 5 times in a little 'fight', she's such a vampire
O_o
Yeah, love hurts ;.;
Your friend physically bites you?
Well, yeah..
,,,
See, she was IM'ing at school at lunchtime
*...
/me runs
And I kinda talked in there, we fought over the laptop, she bit; and I bit back; then she had to get a bit of my tasteless geek blood out of her mough

03oh
03I just got my cardstock today so yeah
07didn't you use regular paper last year? |D
03Yes
03but last year I used quarter-fold cards
03this year they're half fold
03mainly I did that because I needed envelopes, regardless what size
03and I was like, if I'm gonna use fancy paper, I'm making bigger cards XD
07lol
03gives me more room to write
03also hm
03I wonder if my laser printer can print card

03They don't write themselves
OK
Back to tidying the room for me
03actually they could if I told them to. that's not the point
/me runs
03wow you can tell I'm tired, I accidentally wrote on this card upside down x.x;.
what
anyway bbl
03as in, I wrote on the wrong part of it so when you open the card it looks upside down
03I fixed it, I just had to waste more cardstock reprinting it
03After this card I'll have all the non-US people's cards done, and I'll go put them in the mailbox before going to bed, so they'll go out sooner. I work on the US people's later this week

lol Facebook. There's a local Mormon church that sent out a bunch of invitations to random people
Well, at least it's better than a foot in the door.
Kinda.
I said, "Can't go; I'll be busy having premarital gay sex while drinking alchohol, looking at pronz, and teaching evolution to orphans."
:P Maybe, but now I don't have a door to shut in their face, Espeon.
12o-o
hmm
"Too bad. I think you would like the lights"
Since whoever sent those invitations knows how to operate a computer he/she SHOULD take the joke. But oh well, jokes on the internet never fails to... fail
And LOL at the evolution thing.
if it'll load
It be a you
"Oh ho hoo there will be plenty of lights where I'll be, I assure you. ;3"
Lol seems like the site is slow atm
XD That doesn't make any sense, I'll admit it, but I wonder how they'll take it.

You'll be waiting for them in a warm and lightened up place it seems.

stupid karaoke
2Too bad Nintendo decided to stop making games after XD Gale of Darkness. The whole idea of snagging and purifying Shadow Pokemon was awesome.
The way to purify them in XD was confusing I found
I prefered the original way of doing that
2It was more difficult to purify them in Colosseum. :/ That stupid Shadow Rush had that recoil to it.
speaking of which, I should finish the game xD

I like a lugia plushie xD
Added*
Thanks
Also I'm looking at bids on YT on how to EV train
13o3o
6friggin lugia plush
6it's so big
How the he'll did that guy get his weaviles speed stat to rise by 23 points?!
13EV train is easy, but it can be hard to understand at first |D
6it eats up like my entire bed
04lul
04Aurora
04you plush eats your bed
04scary stuff
You have the giant lugia plush ROARA?
6nick, I MADE the giant lugia plush
6well
6A giant lugia
Oh no wait you mean the one you made?
13Nick, I've had my Lugia get +48 points in sp attack from EV training :P
6yes that one
13Also, brb
What you said
6and yeah, I got my absol's attack to go up 32 in one level
Yeah I saw that :)
Great stuff
6yep
/me -$ test
04...
04>>
6lol
@ angel Espeon HOOOOOOOOOOOOWWW?!
;-;
13I can try to explain when I get back, if someone else doesn't beat me to it xD
it's doing my nut in on this ev training lark
Anyway I watched a clip of best wishes too, well, abridged series rather
6well
That dudes first ever pokemon Tsutarja/Snivy beat Ash's pikachu...
DOES
NOT
COMPUTE!!!
04aww fff
6getting up that many points involves held items, nature, characteristic, base stats, and level
It's like my starter totodile beating lances dragonitr XD
rawr
Hmm ok
I'm thinking of getting the speed raising brace with my BP
but I only have 16 BP
Wb
13brought my food with me :P
hiya Ari
here ya go!
13For EV training, I just use a macho brace and pokerus
/me needs to find out what natures his team are
13because I happen to have a lot of Pokemon with pokerus on my games xD
:o
^^
I can't get my pokemon to get damn pokerus ><
13Well
13I have a baby Pokemon giveaway thread on TST
I do have a macho brace tho
13and I'm offering to give anyone pokerus with each trade as well :P
/me hugs
Does your pokemon have to have pokerus tho? In order to ev train?
13Nah, pokerus is just an added bonus that makes EV training go by a lot faster
Hmm ok
13I know what you mean about not understanding Pokerus, it took me forever to teach myself about it by looking online xD
13it's easier to understand when you have someone explain it to you, as a few of my friends have told me
13wait
13I mean
13EV training
13xD
13but yeah
13I'm generally bad at explaining stuff, but I can at least try :B
I thought what you had to do was level up against a pokemon with the stat you want
13well, that's basically it :P
Pokerus is an STD that's beneficial to you.
Creepy I know
So I fitted Lucario with Macho brace and levelled up just fighting golbat at mt silver
/me flops
13every Pokemon gives a certain number of EV points in what would be considered that Pokemon's best stat
But when I levelled up I got only two ev points :/
13You can have a max of 510 total EV points on a Pokemon altogether, and a total of 255 in one stat
13I've noticed it starts off slow, but you make more progress the more you keep it up
I know all that but I just don't seem to be doing it right
13Oh, you also need to know if your Pokemon isn't already maxed out in EV points
Hmm my Lucario is 170 something in speed
So I doubt it's mazes
Maxed
13If you go to the person who gives out effort ribbons to Pokemon, you can find out if your Pokemon is maxed on EV points or not
13if they give you an effort ribbon, you're maxed out
13if they don't, you still have EV points to spare :P
Where are they?
13What game are you playing?
In SS?
13Blackthorn City
K
13house to the right of the pokemon centre
13Also it's normally best to EV train a Pokemon as soon as you first get, since all Pokemon start off with 0 EVs
13if you've been training up your Pokemon randomly in the past then you've probably picked up EVs that have been spread randomly throughout all of the Pokemon's stats
Yeah
I got a few lvl 80 ones now:/
So I wanna try ev training them now
13Have you checked with the woman in Blackthorn City if your Pokemon are already maxed out or not
13Because if they are, you might want to get some EV-reducing berries to take off points in certain stats
Anyway gonna go watch tv now
Thanks for help angel
13xD Have fun
Ty bye all
6ok bbl
hey lighting
yo
lightning you there
are you mad at me
I'm sorry
no i'm not mad why would you think that? i'm just multitasking while online
oh
well because you didn't answer me the first time i was worried that you wouldn't talk to mt until i said sorry
13...In all honesty, I wasn't finished explaining |D and something tells me he didn't get the fact that if his Pokemon are already maxed out then there's no point EV training them
It's always confusing beyond belief the first time you hear about EV's
:3
thats normal for me unless there are a lot of people in here
have you wondered what i've been doing all the time i've been gone
ehhh no
13then one day it suddenly makes sense
just wait before you say something i gotta put on some music
13and then you're like "OMG I UNDERSTAND NOW"
13etc
i'm good
well i've been playing wizard 101
Yes, like many other things
hey do like sonic the hedgehog
nice I'm just resetting the friend codes on several of my wii games
13Like the fact that your catchphrase seems to change often
13up until recently it was "or something"
13now it's "it seems"
yeah big fan of sonic i'd even say my favorite video game character
13:P
i writting a couple of sonic fanfics\
you wanna hear about one
ehhh perhaps another time
why what'cha doing
Why not mix them? :3
replaying a 3rd of my wii game library after having to restart the games over....
hey did ever beat super metriod
nope never played it not really a fan of metroid although i did play through zero mission several times
oh hoping you could help me
although i've seen the entire game played before
yeah but on the computer not on the wii
wouldn't it be exactly the same though since i'm guessing your running it on an emulator
wow...there are actually others here!
because there's this one level that i can't get past because the floor breaks underneth me but if i jump i get by spikes
what game?
super metroid
ah
that one was a true pain for me,.
i'm guessing knowing the metroid games you might be short of a upgrade
did you get through it
not all the way, unfortunately
Mother Brain always killed me.
not unless you get boost ball in super
no the level where you have to run be fore fall through the floor but if jump there's spikes
hmm....don't remember...sorry. ^^;
hmm perhaps it might require the charge boots or whatever that power up is called *to run very fast*
hey lightning how about we meet here tomorrow at four and tell you about sonic fanfictions
ok i'll most likely be online during that time
ok see you then
peace
oh, you want to know about SOnic Fanfics?
ehh nope lol that user just wanted me to see a couple that they're writing
ah
kay.
I WAS writing a Spyro Fanfic
got a while into it....then just lost motovation...
and I killed the chat.....I've a knack of doing that...
lol I used to read them frequently but don't really anymore

Umbreons must play nice I guess
we still have finals D:
we're off on the 23

yay
I actually don't know the exact date we're off. <.<
you must not completely hate school like me than XD
Oh, I hate classes
But I don't hate college :P
Ah
you wanna see? *shot*
I seriously can't wait for the new semester though
no more putting up with my annoying liberal honors teacher
pass :p
Lol
that must be fun
Very
He's also obsessed with bees
/me fluffs Espeon
Is it the same one that said that Disney was evil or something?
...bees?
No, that was last year. XD
...freaking liberals
:P
/me fluffs Skylands
That teacher was OK though; he didn't try to preach politics during class like this one does
lol, yeah
probably have job security so he can say whatever the heck he wants
this guy is a bee keeper and manages to bring bees into almost every discussion we have
*has
Yeah >_>
That's really random
I made sure to give him a bad evaluation though, haha
Very nice.
10Fluff chain
"Brings irrelevant political opinions into the conversations." "Doesn't keep students on topic." "Brings students off topic."
12yes
12..Ecco is dinner now?
12but i don't want to eat dolphin D:
If you had any friends in that class you couldve got them to write similar things too
they did
yes
We complain about him all the time actually
put him in his place! XD
I actually did once! :D
How so?
/me pets
wut
Despite the fact that that had /nothing/ to do with the text we were reading
Yeah, apparently we have friends because it helps us survive.
because checking facebook is definitely a survival instinct
So he kept interrupting everything we said and talking about bees
/me stacks Umbreons
/me latefluffs someone too it seems.
Like "bees do this, therefore humans do this"
o.O
So finally I just told him, "I think we would be able to make our points a lot better if you would stop interrupting us."
...and he actually stopped
I think he's probably over simplifying things just a little bit
:D
Haha nice
Someone in the class brought up online relationships
Their existance proves that humans don't solely choose their friendships based on pheremones like bees do
But he completely ignores that point and starts talking about bees again
*facepalm*
Despite the fact that we kept bringing it up over and over
/me floofs Espeon
sounds like a typical internet argument to me
Exactly!
/me falls in love?
/me is confused.
well at least thee whole calss isnt agreeing with everyting he says
Yeah, but some people were
*the class
one girl brought up the stupidest argument I've ever heard in my life
good.
She said he's right, and friends are needed for survival because we'd commit suicide without them
/me used Confusion on Espeon?
O_o
-___-
lol
/me offers a fish then
better then dolphin
somehow if bees didnt live togther I don't think they would commit suicide
it doesnt really correlate
Yeah, exactly
So that point makes no sense

12it was a little rushed
12so i didn't bother sharing it XD
And of course, he accuses us of "knee-jerk responses" and asks /us/ to come up with an answer for the question he couldn't answer himself

okay, I'll keep that in mind
Bye Umbreon
I got something about honors inthe mail the other day
what exactly is that class about anyway?
It's basically a class that you take instead of their normal Lasallian Core Traditions
You read books that the teacher assigns and talk about them during class
Floofbutt
!define godes
-!- Gode (ጎዴ; Godey) is a city in the Ethiopian part of the Ogaden. Located in the Gode Zone of the Somali Region, the city has a latitude and longitude of . ...
every so often you'll have to write short interpretive papers about what you read
hm, but Mr. Beekeeper gets to choose all the books?
It's great because it covers a lot of useless classes you'd have to take if you were in LCT
10Love the background
Yeah, but only if you have him for first semester sop[censored]re year
"sop[censored]re"
Hah
that system does sound good though
10(as usual)
Thanks, I made sure to give it more of a B&W look
12He and the other first semester sopho12more teacher get to choose the books for that semester
It's the same thing
Yus
and bai
You'll have a different teacher every semester, and there will be two to choose from
Lol, filter
I forgot about that thing
It doesn't censor muffins anymore though :(
but but...the censoredins...
:(
I know... D:
cucesoredbers?
cucumber
nope
Aww
6oh that was yours?
13Lol wut
why can't you say "[censored]" though?
6saw it show up in the club, awaiting approval
13I'm halfway through the second Best Wishes episode
13Has Ash seriously forgotten how to catch Pokemon? =w=
6the name looked familiar I wondered if it was you
6of course he has
what was the "censored"
Yes, I worked all day on it, lol
6he loses his memory each season
in sop[censored]re
because it says ho2mo
=/
I know, just wondering why you cant say it
I guess because people use it as an insult
Oh, I figured out that epic-chat has the exact same filter as spyroforum
XD
the SF filter has the most random words ever and they're all censored here too
do you still go to SF?
Heck no
ok
just wondering...
I had an email from bmah from a long time ago from when he was complaining about the filter
I actually go to darkspyro now. lol
really?
Yeah
I wouldnt stoop that low...
:P
there are some really immature people there, but it's OK for the most part
There's this guy there who pretty much attacks anyone who says they have a religion
Reshiram is a very time consuming pokemon to draw, lol
it's ridiculous
wow
do yuo ever post there?
it's like, yeah, I get that you're an atheist, but why do I have to explain my religion to you when you've already made up your mind about it again?
I post sometimes
If Ash was in the game world he would be reminded how to catch Pokemon once a month by some random old man anyway.
whoo
I started going there when I heard about the new Spyro game that's supposed to be coming out in 2011
Have you heard about it?
o.o
no
is it LoS or what?
There’s so many fine
We don't know yet
details on it that you have to be
careful not to miss
Activision hasn't actually announced anything
But someone found some leaked information
just speculation mostly?
And apparently the working title is "Spyro's Kingdom"
And it's supposed to be on just DS and Wii
huh
13Lol wow, Team Rocket are actually awesome for a change
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_HIWdicVSQ
Spyro's supposed to be a Playstation exclusive
6yeaaaaah-
6not for long
or it was 10 years ago
It hasn't been ETD
XD
:P
13...oh dear |D
That was only because insomniac only developed for playstation, I think
/me sits on Kipi
Getting the colors right was hard to, because Reshiram isn’t solid white
People are speculating that they might keep it in the LoS universe, take off the "dark and edgy" stuff, and make it more lighthearted and fun
That wouldnt be so bad
maybe
Since Nintendo is more well-known for family games
but the working title is kind of lame
I agree
As some people think, same thing with Lugia
I'm very disappointed by darkspyro's poll
remember when we were first hearing about ANB?
the working title was "Spyro: Legend"
XD
Hah, yeah
Is it still the music poll?
yep
I can't believe people voted for DotD over StD
=/
in know right?
I just dowloaded some Spyro songs the other day actually
13Omg Mijumaru is so cute in the anime
13It's been a while since I last enjoyed myself watching Pokemon |D
Misty bog, dry canyon, toasty
EPIC
:P
You downloaded them?
where?
o.o
that one kh something or other site
oh khinsider
I could find it if you want
Enjoy it while it lasts
I used to have them from there, but then I deleted them all after I found out they were supposedly illegal
I really find myself enjoying watching it. Even though it’s in Japanese XD
:/
But it's not like they were released anywhere else
Or anyone's making a profit off them
=/
somehow I doubt that Stewart Copeland woukld care 11 years later
exactly
Probably not
Can’t wait for the shows to be in English
Now I won't get them because I'm too paranoid about viruses from that site. >.>
it gave you viruses before?
No, but you never know
:P
13Shows are nearly always better in Japanese anyway :B
I have no idea where all those viruses came from
you could use your old laptop, and then tranfer the files
or would that not do anything?
I don't know
but my old laptop won't even power on now. XD
that poor thing
abused
:P
the battery died from sitting in the computer without being used for so long
That happened when dad took it away
So now I'll have to buy another new battery and another new AC adapter.
-_-
I wouldn't wate the money if I had your nice laptop
*waste
it was good for taking to classes though
and I could leave it on all the time
Do you have a laptop yet? You're going to want one for college
not yet
(right)
Well, you're not me
So for you, it might be possible
:P
I can only hope
So you could have her old one!
....yay?
...with the metal bolt holding the screen together...!
yeah.......\
too many periods..
.....seriously, i think I hear crickets! xD
I'll wait as long as possible before buying myself one
just in case
/me crickets chirp
Well if you don't get one, I'll buy the AC adapter and battery for mine and give you that one for $150
really?
Sure
Yay
thanks
No problem
I bought it for about $350, so ...
computers lose a lot of their value after they've been used for a while
how much do new ones sell for
lol
Anywhere from the price I got my old one for to like, $3000
but those are Apple
the really expensive ones
I know if I get a cheap one, I won't be able to fix all the problems very well
but I'd rather not pay 1000 bucks
There shouldn't really be problems with the cheap ones
they just won't be as fast

"1) No known species of reindeer can fly, but there are 300,000 species of living organisms yet to be classified. While most of these are insects and germs, this does not COMPLETELY rule out flying reindeer which only Santa has ever seen."
"2) There are 2 billion children in the world (persons under 18), but since Santa doesn't (appear) to handle Muslim, Hindu, Jewish, or Buddhist children, that reduces the workload by 85% of the total - leaving 378 million according to the Population Reference Bureau. At an average (census) rate of 3.5 children per household, that's 91.8 million homes. One presumes there is at least one

To mah PC
Its about getting to know the community, making your own channel, and having people to trust
stuff like that (:
mew
And kitties
yuppp
7Who here knows Latin? D:
pretty much
We focus on the people on the network — everything else is secondary.
This comes from Google's statement of principles and is perhaps the most important guiding principle that we have. With every strategic change we make on Epic Chat, we have to ask ourselves if this is in the best interest of the core community and of the people of the network as a whole.
Shhhhhh, he can read it!
Hush, you.

Why? :o
/me hugs mibbit users

I dislike mibbit too

You can ban mibbit in your channels
yeah,
*!Mibbit@*
i know,
does her hostmask change?
lol i thought you were joking
lolfail
That's a real command :3
how do you unban ?
hi :0
its stefan
Or *is* it?
it is ari
/me sighs

i tried that, nothing happens
just a lot to do.. and i have to do it by myself :(
fix it
done
thanks
6*icypoke*
Aristoe
i need help
Okies
when i ban *!MIBBIT@*
it sais that its banned, and it works
Okay
So....
but when i unban a certain mibbit hostmask, it sais that that hostmask is not banned
How do you unban it/
?*
??
Right... you banned *!Mibbit@* .... "unbanning" isn't what you think it is -- to unban something, you're just removing the host you set before
Exceptions...how do you do exceptions
Oh my god...
*dies*
yes, i want an exception
6What? D:
maybe like a +I HOSTMASK?
You poked my brain
/mode #channel +e host
what is +e?
lol
Really?
=exception
+*
and it works?
one sec
It should
Just be careful with exceptions
Don't wanna make them too liberal
6I poked your arm.. D:
That's where my brain is! D:
lol
There's no fantasy command set up for exceptions, I'm afraid ;_;
6Why? D:
yay
it works (:

hi
12hey drf right on time
12I have a problem with loading that winamp program to mIRC
He's using WIN7- 64
o.o
And I tried to set it up, but the folders are confusing, so I couldn't get mIRC to load the directory
Even with exact address
Doesn't work, being updated
directorty?
-t
you just put the files in the mirc folder
Yeah, that's what I mean
TeamViewer would be the best choice, but you don't have it on your home pc
12I do have it on my pc.
I was taking about DRF
12oh
yeah I don't have it on here
wait
you derps
/me read logs
XD
I'm reading them too
if you get /load: no such file 'C:\Program' then you put quotes around the address
o.o;;;
"C:\Program Files (x86)\mirc\...<etc>" WITH quotes
just do /load -rs gtsdll.ini
why would you even give it the path?
that generally goes to %appdata%\mIRC I find
Well, I needed to; since it was in my other HDD XD
it doesn't on 6.21.
