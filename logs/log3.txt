6omg you're seriously gonna tell me you took that offensively...
03I'm totally straight but that doesn't mean I'm homophobic
14I want to go to a gay pride parade
02Ne neither....
03though tbh
03why do they use the term "phobic"
03that's supposed to mean *afraid of*
14because
03not *dislikes*
03that's just stupid
14drf
02It is afraid...
03no it's not
14think of the mormons for a sec
Back!
03homophobic is a term for hating gays
6NO
6ABSOLUTELY NOT
14they're highly against gays and lebians
6we are not bringing religon in here
02ORLY...?
6considering that's pretty much /my/ religion
6thank you
03the term "phobic" means *afraid of*
whut
14because it ruins their plans of their erm
03but somehow the term homophobic doesn't mean that o.o
14well I dunno what's it called
02Whut?
14but in jehovah witness term, their "great ressurection"
:D
6>.>
14I guess
4People hate that which they fear, people fear that which they do not understand.
02She is a Jehova....?

14I consider this racisit

I don't remember middle school.
02You didn't?
hi
It might not have happened.
High school I hated.
12hi there quil
10At least, for my high school, people matured a bit
02Still hatin from day 1
02yeah, you are right sky
how is?
6see, once you get out of high school, everyone worries about classes again
I think I hated the world more in high school than I do now.
Which says a lot.
6it's awesome
02Everybody Dematured
:\
12i dunno
02:(
12:3
6see, in college, you can be cool outside of high school standards
6POKEYMANZ YES

In college, you can be cool period. lol
No one's allowed to be cool in high school.
02LOOOOOOOOL
02I know...

!umbreo

02I don't know how Pokemans was in Middle School

!shipping
12eep
02Nobody really talked about it

02I'm always a "outcast"...
trust someone to ave the same nick :3
!shipping
Eventually you'll stop feeling it.
6my advice is DON'T SECLUE YOURSELF
6*seclude
dammit.
14yeah, k
02But it's my nature....
/me hides
I can't play some games because my computer came with an outdated graphics card
:3
Go to the right college.
02Me neither
14Aurora
14stay in college when I graduate
14so we can raid it
02XD
6you see, most people /say/ that, but in fact people /do/care
You won't have to seclude yourself if you hang around the right people.
6whether or not they admit it actually can't be helped sometimes
Thing is, in high school there's no such thing as the right people.
But college is different.
Because you can choose.
02"Right People" are hard to find here...
6the right people is however you decide you can trust
6I found that in people younger than me -_-
There are wrong people to trust.
02I have some old friends
Those are everywhere.
Like me!

02YOU Roll over >:O
:3
No u!
I mean really
It's frikkin' ridiculace
12so i can start round 3 XD
Why?
Because
I know you do, glac
Because America needs more resources
Greed is costing people's lives
12doesn't everyone?
easy as that
We HAVE resources
lol
02ME
12dunno yet
12it's random
We just use oil instead of other products
Which is retarded
K
No
Unfortunately
12no guarentees
the claiming of more resources, and profits for their markets is that concerns them
But someone, SOMEONE should step up and say that it's enough
12but probably aero or manlyguy
if people die, then they die
just that then we're viewed as 'extremists'
'terrorists'
the correct term being 'communists' :P
Dude, they die BECAUSE OF THE WAR
and lol
How about this
which happens repeatedly
Mmhmm
and no
We take a look at our damn constitution
12but yeah
and our 'god give rights' ;p
12if you won
And tell the polititions that they're blinded by greed
12you would be 2/0, aero would be 2/0, and manlyguy would be 2/0
but really, when has the constituion been...good?
In fact I say we make a mile-long petition
A lot of times actually
12don't give me too much credit
Just noticed
After amended
before?
12it's a bad time
No
lol
02XD....
protecting rights?
:P
Yeah
It's written there
Yea, tell that to the Japanese prisoners, or African civil right leaders, or even muslims today
Honestly
about how they are 'protected'
*politition
a right, can not be taken away
a privilge, can
12hmm
12only 2 people haven't won a match yet
thats the difference
Lol
12that makes pairings easier XD
Still
Higher ups seem to think this: $
Is more valuable than this
<===
they dont care about you as a person
object
or tool
Exactly
you're just a thing to be used
They care about money
And that's fvcked up
Amirite?
been that way for 500 years
its been fucked up
Yep
That REALLY needs to be changed
12after round 4 i have to calculate everyone's resistence
night all
Well you wont find it in a president
reformism =/= change
Unfortunately -_-
02Night

:O
but, but, but, the TV said it did!
Quiet
2oh, I see.

They're not sure if it actually exists.
If it does, our concept of mass and photons is all wrong.
2hm..do you know how to get ndiswrapper configured then? sorry I'm a bit of a beginner at Linux~

12I misread that...
Haha, it /always was/ a scam.
App?

Itouch app
An app used to create matter
LOL!!
02Of course you did...
didn't you know about it?
2yeah Chimy?~
I have Wi-Fi work perfectly
I use Ubuntu
yes, you can touch this app
:P
2oh, I see..
On an OLD LAPTOP
2is Ubuntu good?
Yes very
You can even taste it.
Yes
02Nao?
2okay..
Every app on this iPod is eatable, even I am eatable.
2I might be tempted to switch to that~ :D
Except for the fact that apple hates it
You can use it for pretty much anything
I can't see why a lot of people say it's bad though
02:(
no
That makes it good
03it does XD
02It's too niche'
No iTunes syncing
03EW ITUNES
The earbuds taste like earbuds!
XD
That's why I didn't like it
02EWWW
Yeah
2Apple=money grubbers
03Ubuntu 10.04 supports iPods, therefore it fails in my eyes :(
Earbuds are eatable?
iPod touch
/me eats Lambda's earbuds
/me is nommed~
02O_0
Nummy
Like I said, everything is eatable.
Doesn't work with ios devices
And drf realize this
But eating other people is called cannibalism, my dear children...
Are pancakes eatable?
2lol
...and is frownded upon in civilized nations.
12he doesn't mind the fruit
*frowned
2Umbreon: O.o. I see
You lose customers
031. Ubuntu is free
Even though Ubuntu is free LOL
/me returns
03what "customers"
03they arne't paying
... XD
02XD
02True
Awww
03therefore I rest my case.
02Nobody
Good point
Hehe, flapjacks.
/me huggles Kipikipo back~
D:
but...
I like pancakes
02OF COURSE
It's for the great good, people!
/me shot
*greater
2LOL! Okay..
doesn't chocolate make all that was once eatable into something that is eatable?
*uneatable
:P http://www.theonion.com/articles/un-appoints-first-ambassador-to-aliens,18195/
Chocolate certain has leverage in this argument, but I'm not sure it can overturn the Law Of Eatable Properties.
*certainly
Hm
Well Ubuntu IS free
Since people would want an OS they don't need to pay for
They could probably get that
And then use whatever MP3 player they have with it
Preferrably NOT an iPod but still xD
Haha yeah

02OLRY?
/me runs
No
12remember them?
03dude

LISTEN!
03NO
>_>
F*ck you
12Chimera
/me flees
K
You record the event with both cameras
When the event is over turn off ONE camera
Or something
03which could easily be faked
...
It shows the process of you filming
And then uploading RIGHT WHEN IT'S DONE
no
I mean
03.....
03Have you ever heard of PAUSING?
Yes
03as in
... YOU DO THAT
03yea
03h
Gah
02I haz a Coolpix P1
12even if you turn the first camera on
03therefore FAKING THE ENTIRE THING
12there is still a moment where one of the cameras is off
02Hmm...
12and you can't prove only like 5 seconds passed between turning a camera on and off
we saw a bumper sticker like that the other day
03HOW CAN YOU PROVE THAT YOU DIDN'T USE PAUSE
02NO pAUSE... MADNESS
12then even if you do
okay
02!madness
"When he's done all you'll have left is change"
Tell me how I can pause perfectly
:P
On both videos
Tell me that
03you only need to pause on one
Still
03you pause as soon as you turn the camera off...
03the first camera
12Chimera
03and resume
12the best way to prove something
Tell me how the transition can be 100% accurate
...
Yes
But
I have to be in the same position
Same EVERYTHING
Well, I must heet hay.
12why are we even arguing this guys?
night Neeawn
2Objection

02MAN SHADDIUP....
Yes bree
Now listen
03you're underestimating just how easy it is for someone to find flaws
Drf
03for example
03pause the second camera
03on another computer
03then just sit back down, resume
07o3o
'Night, jive turkeys.

12and verify that all the games are there
depends on the amount of clothing involved
Snuggling has no set requirements
12i would be extremely greatful if you can provide this for me
What's the problem in that
12Chimera
12even with all the proof in the world
07it would just be EXTREMELY difficult to pull it off
07but it could still be faked
12and nothing but

/me is shot from everyone in the room
03when you pull a light out
03the whole strand dies
03that's proof that they're wired in series
12hmm i never had that happen
12the the fact that "darnit... i have this cord of like 300 light bulbs, one of them is out...
12"
03I'm not talkinga bout burned out
12i know
03I mean if you straight up pull a bulb out
12taking it out
*Look
12i was changing the subject :P
o/
03k
03like I know why they used to go out if a bulb burned out
I remember I hated my music teacher and my gym teacher
03and why they don't know XD
03*now
12i remember when he made us take apart old VCRs
Skype!
12mine still had a VHS tape in it and he saw me struggling to get the tape out
12he just walks upto me, picks up the VCR and drops it on the ground XD
/me is about to sleep
Damn.
I never liked my gym teacher either
or in high school
12ever watched national lapoon
I didn't like that gym teacher either
03some of them

03yeah
The only teacher I ever hated was my web design teacher
:<
12christmas lights mania
XD
we had a pure evil librarian
All music teachers think that :P
my friend and I had theories about her evil plans to kidnap our other friend
I never had any friends in school it was a great hobby for me

12it has both feline and canine features
12so it would just be easier to say its a combination of both
It's a programed piece of coding
12oh
12?
12and literature is just words on a piece of paper
02Good one TG
12lol
02D
It exists because it's developers needed a sprite for said character
12if i remember right
12meaning that it's a drawing first, and a programmed sprite 2nd
02Interesting
12i could be wrong though
12i have no way to prove it
02Use the power of Wikipedia!
Or bulbapedia.

12basically you have 4 chefs in a 3 round course
12premeal, meal, and dessert
12they are given odd ingredients that don't usually go together and are forced to cook a meal that involves all those ingredients
12judges taste the meal and pick one cook to be taken out, then the other chefs go onto the next round
lol readysteadycook
12and instead of stopping the food to tend to the wounds he digs back into the food and starts rolling his mixture into a ball while blood was dripping into the dish

Hello, Creideiki.
Hello peoples
02Overly Basic C++
02And it's purpose is to...
Speaking of programming, I'm going to do some programming now.
02EPIC BGM IS FREAKING EPIC </random>
02I'm mauling my .txt Reader into a *IT*
02I've finsihed the first one, but I'm wondering if I should make another one...
C++ is slightly weird.
Too many brackets and semicolons to take care of. It's rather complicated.
Hyper: Okay... now remake that exact same program... in assembler.
It is, and assembler...no way.
02And those darn bracets
02I'm only going to compile it into a .exe
Fortran is also something I'd rather stay away from.
I classify it as a "Python clone".
02XD
Python is good, though.
03physics exam time...
Fortran is easy actually.
03Wish me luck everyone
Good luck drf
Good luck, drf.

02Byez
They're just massive ports for cables
02O3o?
Also, I am looking for two specific plugs actually.
03Damn it
(Which I need just two... each costs $15.80. *grumble*)
/me trying te program a remote to work with a different TV
That's a reasonable price for an Amphenol connector, you know.
(A 14-S9P and a 14-S1P.)
Although it really depends on the size
Oh... and also I forgot I need a third, which is a 38999 connector.
(Which is - for some reason that eludes me - the plug for a "ruggedized" wi-fi router.)

02Komrad BlakcWing
/me runs
14<Aurora> I think vegetarianism is stupid <-- it isn't stupid at all. most vegetarians are vegetarians not because of "SAVETHEANIMALS" it mostly because they hate how the slaughter houses work around the world. it isn't nice, and you wouldn't feel to pleased about being a natural meat-eater and thinking about how pigs get killed in the slaughter houses
14I personally just don't think about it
14but some people got problems have their heads full of ideas
6ok

/me flees

Not really. This mod was strange. "Ooh, what's this mission, cool we're in Russia we're... invading a commune of hippies?"
02:3
(At least that part was hilarious.)
02XD
/me found BROCOLLI in his drink...!
Stryker :D
Then there was the mission involving blowing up a brewery.
02Did you steal some drinks?
/me plays Terra's story on Critical Mode @-@
(Only problem... if you drink all thirty you can carry at a time. Welcome to drunk for five minutes. :P )
02I was going to ask that :p
finally
-_-
/me plays BBS

My cat loves chasing the laser sight on it. \o/
/me goes and fetches his "Repair Kit"
/me is taking his friend paintballing for the first time
FINALLY he decides he wants to come with me
LoopyDood, give him this advice from me: Don't stop pulling the trigger!
02o-o
Seriously. My first time paintballing, I tried to be accurate and not use up a lot.
I sucked.
/me sics some 23rd century Starfleet engineers on Hyper - "Go my minions... repair! Or you go on security duty."
8 hours? D:
Haha
I was there for probably an hour and a half.
How long did you play for?
How much did that cost you?
/me shrugs.
Dozens of games
Field's open from 10am to 6pm, I'm there the whole day every weekend
But yeah, first time, I tried to be as accurate as possible.
02:p
I took aim (I had one of the guns that actually had a sight), and fired once.
Here's a tip: get closer
But then we moved to the inflatable course.
/me bangs his jaw against a wall
My favorite.
12why do i get a bad feeling about this?
I would hide behind the very first one, and peek out the sides.
02Hmmm?
If I saw someone, it was firefirefirefirefirefirefirefirefireohsnapthey'realreadyout.
12what are you saying
/me continues hitting the wall
12please use english -.-
Haha
I was just glad I had a few re-filling tubes strapped around my waist.
Pods?
/me shrugs.
Dunno the term.
I just had a fanny-pack-like thing that held four tubes full of paintballs.
Look at how many paintballs this holds: http://i348.photobucket.com/albums/q330/loopydood_photos/IMG_4685.jpg?t=1286596798
...10? D:
15 at the most
[10:39] <%Aurora> I kick/kill for the enjoyment
04ty
02- I need some assistance, my jaw and tounge has become stuck-
But that's playing 5ish people on each team in an urban field
Haha
We sometimes do games like that
04ty
But, the other way aroun
d
One person's the hostage
12how goes
He starts with the terrorist team
And he has to escape
If he's shot, terrorists win
The terrorists have to get to the other side of the field with him
CTs have to touch him to win
Oh, boy. XD
/me has always wanted to do paintball D:
/me slaps YpeMalUgia around a bit with an iPhone 4G
Wait
But anyway, my hopper actually fell out while I was running.
Why not shoot the hostage straight away?
02At least I can talk properly now!
/me pëw pëws LaptopAristeo
:o
LaptopAristeo: They lose, then
:o
Oh
02But I seem to have a disconnection
oh
02So, if you could kindly climb up me (and not get imapaled) and reattach my head?
The other team
Erm.
Stitch: Running makes you sick?
The other team's president hadn't moved.
That sucks.
I'm constantly running when I play, I need to be :P

o.o
03bedtime
04blah
04I want to play that Mausoleum fight in Halo 2 again :<
04it was epic
lol
I would play it, but my Halo 2 disc is damaged :<
04:<
04that SUCKS
Yeah, it's the limited edition disc too :(
04D:
04me and a friend were playing on Heroic last night
04needless to say
04it took a while to kill those damn Hunters
04I just walked up behind those Ultras, like I always do, and whack them in the back before hitting them with a Fuel Rod shot
04but playing Sniper is fun :D
They have an open spot on there necks
04ah
04oh, and I saw the Honour Guard Councillor for the first time last night
lol Honour Guards
04Honour Guards are pushovers tbh
They don't know how to die >>
04lol
04btw, is it even possible to kill Regret without boarding his floating chair and meleeing him?
I pummeled one with 4 Beam Rifle shots to the head, still lived :<
Yes
Takes a lot of ammo though
04I tried to do it without boarding, because it makes it too easy, and I could NOT kill him
04:\
04Normal difficulty as well
Preferably dual wielding Needlers work best
8 clips of needlers should do the trick
if you're playing legendary though, you HAVE to board kill him
04that sucks
04it'd be a nice challenge to kill him without that on Legen-
04FFFFF
You have to take his shield off yourself on Legendary
That's a b*tch
04so I've heard
04yeah
Snipers don't do much
04two lunges to his back kills him
Not on legendary anyway
04if you get 3 shots to his head in a row with the Beam rifle works
04I saw it work, and not by Johnson
Johnson doesn't help at all on Legendary :<
04I know
In fact only a Co-op player can be of any use
Tis rather annoying doing all the work alone though XD
04lol
04Brute Shpt <3
04Shot*
04epic melee
Brute Shot had 1
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
04XD
04less effective on higher difficulties but it works :3
XD

if she could she'd be kicking me repeatedly
/me wonders why Kitten wants to have a baby on that exact date
because!
Hmmm
great now she wants a beer
/me has a guess
i think it'd be cool to have a baby at 9:10am on the date 11-12-13
lol that would be
Ohhhhhhh
thanks Kitten you just helped me dodge a bullet
you distracted her
Kitten: Why not on 11:11:11 11/11/11?
lmao that would be cool too
how'd i do that?
ooooooh, or, 06:07:08 09/10/11
06:07:08 09/10/11 <--- not cliche
you distracted her with the baby birthdate thing long enough for me to get out of reach of her good arm
Oh
:D
Kitten: How old do you want to be?
mine i'd be 21
i dunno.. but not 18..
okies
/me grabs the shovel of doom
/me digs a hole and buries things in it
:P
Things: Would you like to be a father?
:o
Things: Just do everything Kitten tells you to do
Erm, probably not quite yet :3
oi! i just planted him
no not yet Things.. i'm waiting atleast 2 years..
/me fluffles Kitten
decide where i'm planting you
/me thinks Kitten is really good at naming :3
if its a Him.. i have no idea.. if its a her then i'm going to name her either Mercy Raine, or Miyuki Sun
ooooooooh, pretty :3
/me likes Miyuki Sun
nice names ^_^
thank you!
/me digs a hole behind the channel outhouse and plants LaptopAristeo
oh if Things decides not to be the father between now and time then I nominate Stitch!
/me thinks LaptopAristeo reads too many old books :P
kk
nooooo
That's like the most gutsy thing you could do :3
And he failed and got caught.
Lame.
*norris
nikki corrected me -_-
....... Octavian beat Antony though
Still fail.
Sure.
crap she jacked my coke ;-;
or not lol
cool names too :)
/me bumps tatu
Kitten: Nice names :)

/me blushes
nikki wanted to vote until i pointed out she doesn't know Kitten

they compliment eachother very well

she just jacked my beer ;-;
she's eating her food and anyone else's she can get her hands on
and she weighs 50 pounds less than me

Andres: you are from America right?
Pakistan == exotic from my point of view
:3
/me has to search this word EXOTIC in detail.
/me appoligizes for his weak vocabulary :(
It's okay
I might've misspelled it
The spelling is right but is this a bad word
?
no
mhm
Exotic = alien: being or from or characteristic of another place or part of the world; "alien customs"; "exotic plants in a greenhouse"; "exotic cuisine"
It means foreign, different, but exciting -- it's always used in a good way

I see
12all she has to do is make 2nd place after 4th round

03EW SEREBII
XD
03I basically distrust everything on that site
02Not really...
6lol
6well
6this isn't the forum
03Serebii is basically known to have crap info
03like
03their B/W names
03are half wrong
Everything on that site is legit isn't it? o_O
mike's getting me some ramen to go with my pickles
03the translation from Japanese
And orly
6drf
6they had to change the names
2Whoa
2Kyu is alive
6because of nintendo's warning
03no
02CD>>>2>3>1>
7o.o
7Hai again.
03I'm not talking about the pictures
6half of the names were changed because of it
hi ._.
03...
6neither am I
03well then Serebii is just stupid
Why ._. face?
6pokebeach did it too
pickles and ramen...interesting
03I'd be like "send me a real C&D or I won't "
02That is a Genisis one
No
02Sega CD addon FOR genisis
It's Sega CD
6shanderaa, the correct name for the chandelier, was changed to chandelar
Derp
02Fien then
because my teachers gonna be sad and disappointed at me again :(
/me hugs
03regardless, point of my arguement is that the 5th gen Pokémon suck regardless of name
/me runs
.-.
Drf
:o hi :3
02Stop hatting Gen 5
Which reminds me, I was supposed to re-write an essay....

10you say anything that's good fails lol
Don't care. lol.
Um
I think
03Feather, you say anything that fails is good
/me rus
03*runs
03no but seriously, Serebii sucks
That's because the page editors are lazy
/me pokes LizardGirl
03and the fact that they're in association with #PM helps
I mean really
ouch ;-;
10Apple doesn't really suck :D
03because #PM is evil and that's not just my opinion
02ORLY
i'm already all hurty ;-;
Does an alligator count?

Oh
:DDDDD
D: More than I expected.
6btw

03Chimera, that's my point
/me hides more.

02Wow... Bookworms
Not even for a book
12AND I have more downstairs
I have drawers full
Shelves lined
Closets piled
You name it
And that's with mostly games not books
02My whole left side of my room is filled with my Computer, and bookcase

02With a built in closet
Ahead of that is a radiator/work desk
At my home, I "own" three rooms.
The effective closet of a bedroom.
At least our rooms are different.
02I can barely get into it
Any games you aren't using?
02It's all Junk
02Literally
:p
And then half the furnace room. Which is filled with a wide variety of electronic bits and bobs, once house a full Wall of Computing Power, but is now recuded to File Cabinet of Computing Power. And lots of electronics cruft that I need to clean out/toss out sometime. :P
Well I'm sleep deprived
Curly!
Hi

I'm okay.
You?

/me just got up and showered
slept for aaaages
Before I forget, is Men of War good? :o
yes!
I could imagine...
(And would feel like a WWII submarine not a place to live in. :P )
MoW's an RTS though

o.o
Hi Curly!
every unit has their own inventory, ammo, and the vehicles need fuel and ammo too
and there's physics!

That's... different.
My grandfather's entire home is even worse.
:D
12lolz
that moment's in my gamer hall of fame :3
/me cuddles Curly and throws a grenade at Stryker
I'm sure if a tank got a good shot at another tank it could roll it over even
12chronic messiness is a male thing Guesst
12so I'm not suprised
/me has had tanks bounce away from explosions
02So I have to not knock over anything while trying to reach it
/me hides
:o
02Hatter
/me hugs where
/me explodifies.

It's a WWII sub because he was in the navy

/me is now splattered all over the channel ):
D:?
D:
02But I cannot stand it when anybody touches my room's arrangement
D:!
/me pours Curly into a Curly-shaped mould and puts it in the fridge
/me keeps his computer halfway out into his room
/me unsplatters kari-chan
My room is neat enough to function and Organize, but not to store things
/me opens the fridge, notices the mould and eats it.

D:
It's a single player only expansio...Ewwww
02Storing is now impossible
Not worth it?

Throw the rest away

welcome
hey
how are you?
good, in college atm
are you?
writing the first draft of a presentation about rifles
12yay Nick :D
12and Bloatedfish as well
lol?
and Rifles?
yes
rifles
you at a military college or somethign?
rifling
shooty things
no, I'm not
lol
we just have to do the presentation for product design
I'm doing the "history" of rifles
it's alright
a lot of homeless people
how far back you going?
err
15th century germany, apparently
if its like WW1/WW2 I could be able to shed some light
ugh too far back
I have one book saying rifling was invented in Nuremburg, another in Augsburg
hmm
well rifles weren't really used for war until the american war of independence
and even then, only becuase people had to
before then rifles weren't really used for warfare becuase the projectiles of the time were smooth lead balls that quickly degraded the rifling and the gunpowder of the time quickly clogged a weapon's rifling
neither of which really mattered too much when you're hunting, apparently
lol
muskets caused terrible injuries they were like mini cannon balls
yeah
but woefully inaccurate hence why they turned to rifles
hmm my lesson starts in 15 mins best get some food down me

12what i wanted Quilava to see it
mike's compy is all slow today. it was waaaay faster before it updated itself
6because I disapprove of the ownership script
6except for the bree and espeon ones
6because for me, owning them is practically a meme

12:3
It's worth infinite reposts.

6use MS paint
14noway
squeak
6yeah
12i only use photoshop
12to make the sprites transparent backgrounds
/me dies
6using PS for spriting is like buying a Ferrari and driving 10mph on open highway
14lol
well, look at it this way
14well, I tried GIMP2 for sprites
/me :3
14didn't like it
6well yeah

because she doesn't buy it
i might play some games in a little bit

More then enough time to have fun with portals. :P
02But, they haven't told us how large the RANGE of the Portals are, or how far away from their source they can be
02It also appears that Only 2 Portals can be active at a time
02So a large assult of missles, from different directions would be a problem
/me nuzzles into LizardGirl

14tbh, this wish is highly unreasonable

7Wait.
/me 7glances above.
7SQUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.
How long?
hi Kipi
7Not-here Dragonite, I liked the Orichalcos arc. D:
7Do realize whatshisname, the creator of said media, says that he doesn't really change physically.
7Stop lagging, me. D:
7And May?
14so you're saying Yugi had a split-personality?
7No.
14because I don't think getting taller and more deadly is a split personality
14so he is changing physcially
7Well, you know the story.
7He doesn't actually grow a foot and vocal cords lengthen.
7And eyes... and hair... and clothes...
7It's all artistic.
7May, am I lagging?
14well, that seems odd to me
14no, not really
Kinda like in DBZ?
/me hides
7O_o
7Puh-lease.
:o
02DBZ FTW!!!!
7DBZ has too much filler.
14god no
02:3
How they change hair, size, and voice
07.
7Kipi, no, saiyans are not the same.
02Hawkie!!! <3
07Hey XD
XD
Hullo, Lady Irene.
07Heya Kipi ^c^
07*^v^
7And May:
Either way, they still transform kinda the same. XD
7This is one reason I prefer GX over 5Ds.
14I never watched the rest of the series
14I stopped as soon as I discovered there was no Yugi
7o.o
7Lol
7No, Yugi's still in GX.
Lawl
14hmm
14well
14it must have been way later then
7Bakura appears in one scene.
7Tristan and Tea in the last episode.
7And Ra is used.
7Uhh...
14but no one else
7Ushio is in 5Ds.

02Is it really all artistic?
/me runs
/me shot
7And maybe for something for fangirls to look at.
7That's the reasoning for Riku's inclusion in Coded, anyway.
02That is Yugi
07Quan
07it's called "magic"
07o3o
7Well, there's that, but why would people not realize it, then?
Wat
Quan no
03:з
yeah
Wasn't something like that on the TV once?
7ô.o
Like, a more child-friendly version XD
erm
7Explain?
well
on the TV show
7You mean anime?
YEP
7Hmm...

k
X3
7Ah, this is after Duelist Kingdom.
She ended up getting blindfolded
7The date, right?
7No?
I think
7That's the first anime series.
I DUN REMMEBER
/me flees
7Same thing--manga adapted to anime.
7Same event. D:
7Pre-Duelist Kingdom.
02-Fangirl Filter Activated-
7LOL
07it was lame D:
7Why? D:
02Hmm, do YOU know why it is soo empty?
7Wangst, I'm assuming?
7Character supposed flanderization and exaggeration?
^
07noah's was lame too lol
07and i forget the kc arc o.o
07what was that one again
7Right after Orichalcos.
7With the Marluxia Expy.
7*trope*
7XD
02What wall?
7I'd say that the Grand Championship was mostly pointless, except that the antagonist reminded me of Marluxia.
ew
02All I see is blanks
Noah's Arc
that was confusing
7It's Kaiba fanservice.
7Good for whoever likes him.
7:3
7Oh, yeah:
07me
07XP
5Gaaah. Why in this sub do they have to put Mewtwo's words in STRANGE, DIFFICULT-TO-READ FONT. >< It's bad enough it's in another language lol~ /complaaaaain
5Hiya Creideiki!
Hello peoples
7Jerkier than he normally is.
7Oh, yeah:
Roleplay4life: They put it in a hard to read font because they're being artsy. And don't realze that not everyone has a 700 metre TV. :P
7Noah's arc has one good thing to it, though: soundtrack.
(And that sans serif fonts must die and long, horrible and painful death.)
7And the puns, I guess. Even if they're sorta lame.
7And a stupid yet fascinating jarring of edutainment and genre switching.
5And it's only /his words/ ahahaha.
7Really. O_o
5I think it's a fansub.
02?.?
Well, again, people being artsy is the explanation.
And they deserve a very rapid, and very firm application of a boot to the head.
Quan
7:|
it made me wat XD
also Quan
Wasn't that the same series with the Lavyathin?
(jewish creature lol)
7Leviathan? Yes.
5But it could be worse.. Font's not too bad as long as I pause.
heh
7I particularly liked the Orichalcos arc because it was darker than the rest of the series.
7AND IT WASN'T IN ANY TOURNAMENT.
07well I'm off
7Don't get me wrong, the fanservice isn't the only reason I liked the Orichalcos arc. XD

LizardGirl smoking is bad :P

/me tickles Curly
/me rolls away

Hehe

7xlz;faskldrjas
/me 7needs to find chapter 41 of the manga somewhere. D:

if Quebec seperated they'd be taking the second biggest city with them >.>
Nothing.
I have no idea
/me has never really paid attention
just angry french canadians.
5If I see the words "más fuerte" one more time in the subtitles...
me either
ontario has a lot of manufacturering.
quebec probably has lots of bread.
/me runs
My aunt when to university in quebec.
5lolwut?
we should just get a lot of huge drilling machines and seperate quebec and push them off into the ocean. they can be their own little continent.
02Look, the moon! The moon! The moon came out!
/me points to the Half Moon ouside
I think you guys should lose Quebec and annex part of the U.S.
/me 7blinks.
Washington, Montana, just whatever's touching the U.S. border
I am french! I surrendor!
we want alaska back.
That way, everything's a little more even
we should invade washington
7Well, that figures; something odd musta've happened for not-Dan Green's LP counter to go to 98. O_o
and Target.
You don't want Alaska
Trust me
I went to alaska
its cool.
14how's the moon doing?
14TROLOLOOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
/me runs
Every Canadian stereotype from the U.S. actually is accurate in Alaska
south is the US north and north is the US south
They have the most liberal gun laws in the nation
id actually move to alaska.
The Washington Examiner seems to be rather... stupid: http://failblog.org/2010/02/09/news-fail-4/
I don't know about Alaska but I know a few people who've worked at the Arctic
they don't recommend it >.>
alaska is the only place id ever move away from bc
and I dont really want to move that badly.
/me really would like to move to BC
I'm planning on visiting in the winter
02There going to do well anyway
/me was born in Winnipeg
chilliwack is good, we can go to vancover if we need to.
5So I wouldn't call the Washington Examiner all that fail after all.
/me is hoping to get Canadian citizenship while the laws are pretty cool about it
and I'm convinced that ash is a [censored]ing moron
you basically have to buy from the gangsters.
I don't mind strict gun laws
7Hmm...
a used USA army helicopter
with gattling guns :)
5Was it worth it?
wow!!!

7Considering I missed huge plot points, I wish it was finished.

03that would be good enough for me
4Because they know we're all sacrificing our gametime to be there.
03and someone was all "OMG THAT PLAY, DID YOU SEE THAT???"
03and I was like "Um, sure?"
03it was just some dude getting tackled, IMO nothing special XD
03I really only care when someone scores

Hello people
12you just sit there holding a guitar doing nothing else saying "i'm i done yet?"
02Hi Kredit
12am i*
/me runs
Blah... went to Fallsview Casino today (on account of getting into the $20.01 buffet for $12 bus fare.
Their food is ungood, my stomach feels rather bleg.
02Let's just hope you're not posioned
12o.o
/me calls Pac-Man?
(Which means jack nothing since I have a grand total of... 7 PAC points. :P
/me hideshotdies
PAC = 04Player's 04Advantage 04Club.
/me pulls back the sniper and waives
Thanks for standing still, wanker
12D:
/me hides
I have however discovered the way to get lots of "free" PAC points.
02XD
(Duh... you lose one of the bets, with the other bet, which pays back itself and the other bet.)
Keep doing that and you'll eventually end up racking up the PAC points, becuase, each spin loses you 25 cents, and you get a PAC point every 40 dollars (and since you win back that 25 cents, you're essentially losing nothing).
Except on 0.
Then you lose fifty cents outright. :P
12what color would you call cynder

Are they all really /that/ gullible?

which is supposedly impossible
well that is cool man i dont want to bother you.
I have acheived the impossible!

Oh, I thought you were referencing that one time he said that
also when I said updating, I meant it was switching from the weaker one to the brighter one like it sometimes does
....OK, and now it's back to normal

YUP!
because you think they'd have figured it out by now and fixed it
since the site's been around since 2004
I'm hoping it's just that they haven't been on the computer today
yeah
but that can't be, because why did yours go through then?
BITCH!!!
I registered before you
Run like the little scared insect you are
*which
sorry going back and forth between computer and the house
only half the members end up getting accepted, I'm not sure why.
deane isn't very lazy though whenever I email him I get a reply within 15 minutes
I'll bring it up in the Mod Forum.
k I made a post in there, hopefully I'll get a reply back soon.

I think the latter is best for now
and Hi HyperMuzzledLugia
02Hi
02<<
07Rocket_Ninetales
07I agree with you
07Besides
07Work experience.
Yeah just I end up either quitting or worse in those types of jobs
07Yeh.
07Honestly
I've got 4 years of work experience. I would go to uni but I can't pay the rent and bills with nothing
07Work fails like that I've noticed. And yeh...
yeah, I never should have left my good job but I needed to move up here to be with Burnett, and I don't regret that at all
I just wish I'd saved up a heck of a lot more
07I never said you did regret the move either
I always put on my CV 'looking for work which takes a lot of time'
I know :)
I'm not going to volunteer because it means working for nothing and less time to look for work....I would volunteer if I had a job and spare time though. And thanks but I've been feeling really down being out of work again.
02Well, good luck with you temp job
/me nods.
07RN I'm still proud of you though, even though it seems really difficult for ya.
07I can't say I've ever experienced the same but honestly, yeh.
07Redundancies?
07can you explain?=
I left college early because I was sick of never having any money...don't follow my example xD as I ended up in a poorly paid job and still no money. But a few years later I was in very good jobs.
Yeah every law firm I have worked in has laid people off because they're in financial difficulty...like the one I had just now.
I left some of the law firms though to move.
Anyway I'm not whining :) I won't talk about jobs much more today haha
07Back
07and Rocket_Ninetales, I never said you were whining. You're having a positive attitude and that I like/respect M>
07*;>
07but yeah. Good luck.
Yeah I just thought I was, lol.
02XD
/me huggles Rocket_Ninetales^^
Got to go for a bit, back later!

Apparently

You can download .pdf files

Hahaha

But
/me wonders if they're /still/ actually buying this
Since I respect Rick Riordan
I'll buy all his other books
02:3
AncientWinds posted the EXACT same greeting to you as she did to me
I just CAN'T FIND this ONE book!
typos and all
It's weird. The Gwendolyn chick keeps saying she's some kind of academic genius, yet she was gullible enough to think we all knew each other through war...
/me flees
nn -_-
a war that ended years before any of us were born
*are dim
Yeah, XD
The same exact post, basically.
And the war of Darchoods and purple dragons
I corrected her spelling of liar.
XD yeah
if anyone asks
the Purple Dragons were our code name for the Viet Cong :P
It is.
Not our fault for being fooled.
*them being fooled
lol yeah
we were clearly joking
if they believe it then they are just outright gullible
Dude
*belch*
Yes?

I cannot believe it

And she's 12.
she's a dumb[censored]
Too young for me.

02Sounds like a 3D slider
But they prevent other apps from modifying brightness
No it doesn't
02Oh well, a slider is a slider
Well, I have to retire for the night.

12but
12blah
02Just like Canvas Curse
12never played it
12o.o
02But everybody liked it in the end
12I still think the best one is Kirby 64
02But Adventure was the best
02It looked AMAZING on the NES
/me shrugs
12did he have the copy ability?
02Yup
12kay
02http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCywgJt2EOQ

/me lols
12I've tried
12and have NEVER beaten Boss Battles in K64
12because of HR-E and Miracle Matter...
02LOL I think they're easy
12they are
/me nods
12HR-E is the one that chases you
12once I get to 02, then I know I win
12huh o.o
02Other than the first 3
1202 takes the top spot for overall perfection
12best music, mood, atmosphere, fight, etc.
12the first 5 bosses...

12Whispy Woods: enjoyable. Pix: annoying
12Acro: annoying but fun
12Magman: fun
02I thought the acro was cool, but the last seqence was annyoing
02Same
12HR-H/HR-E: not bad, but a little long
Criticizing Kirby 64 now?
12Hyper
02Yup
12easy to K-O Acro:
I need another vacation
12I can USUALLY get past the first 4 bosses without damage in Boss Battles
12but HR-E and Miracle Matter...
02Magman was the hardest for me, other than MM
12really?
02Kept falling
I personally haven't played it yet
12I take a point on him at worst
12and blah
$50 for the whole thing?
12now I want to try K64's Boss Battles again >_<;
02Ehh...

12ah
Highway robbery!
02Nah..
02The wii's are about 325-350$ here
12anyway
12the only reason I got Epic Yarn on the release date
Or*
02Just the shipping and taxes raise it up
02Remeber Him?
02Samus Does
12and then the Employee Discount takes 10% off that

Because it's taking my attention away from other games
12this is how I'm going to be the next few weeks/months:
12<random>
I want to stop playing tf2 for awhile, but trading
Oh the trading
The trading that tripled my hat count
1210% of 40 is...
124
02Only 36$
02Nice price
/me nods
12but w/e
I have no time to
I should move my laptop into my room where my wii is or something
Not my room
More like the dining room
Good luck with the second one
02I never aim for 1000%
Only 100%
XD
Why dis I do that?
12lolz

I stopped at the first
Yes it is
12but the last 120 are RIDICULOUS!
02I paused at the 67th
I mean, why?
Why would you do it again
12Where's Waldo: SMG edition
/me flees
HATSHATSHATS!

Sorry, reflex

12meaning Metroid Prime 1-3 and Hunters
02I perfer the first prime ( NEED TO FINSIH)
02Too many unfinished games...

02Almost done anyway
And no spoilers
Eh

02Never going to try to beat it
12I beat Zero Mission, which is technically beating 1...
I think I really did beat it, though
12and Fusion is <3
12ohai drf
When I as like, 11 or something
02Hmm...
12lolz
I really want to play fusion
12Guesst
12at first
12before I got Zero Mission
I played a store demo
12I was actually DRAWING A MAP
And wanted it ever since
12of the first Metroid XD
/me nods
As many did
In the 80s, maps and passwords on paper were common
02Same with my SNES games
12lolz
They made gaming extend outward
12Super Metroid was excellent~
02All those darn MMX passwords
Anyone remember the startropics letter?
12no
12and D:
12dun change the topic D:
02Dun dun dun
Too bad this is cool

/me still hasn't finished Metroid 2

02Never plan to
02fds
12I haven't beaten Hunters >_<;
I need to leave for the night

He reads books though!
D:
I just wait for the movies.
Where's the harm in that?
02LOL
Movies do horrible things to books
99.999% of the time
02Since XP was already on it
03my laptop came with Vistrash
02Ewww
Then I shall patiently for that .001%
03my desktop, since I built it myself, came with nothing.
03actually, technically, I paid for Vista.
03because this was custom too
/me patpats Stryker
Not that sort of movie.
Hehe.
03free upgrade to 7"
03so i was like OK why not
I prefer it to be done and gone in an hour and a half to two hours.
/me throws a dotted compy of Hämlët at Stryker when she's not looking

A patio is like a raised flat paved area, isn't it?
/me has to go to speak to the freshmen now
I'll bbl :3
according to Wikipedia a patio is like a backyard though...
byeee o/
I always called patios the balcony type thing at the back of a house >.>
isn't that a porch?
or a veranda
a veranda is like a ground floor balcony type thing
yeah, I was right, a porch is at the front of the house
a paved area used for dining
http://www.schaeferfan.com/images/ZC-Z12-horiz.patio.w.jpg
without a roof
isn't that a patio?
i don't think it is
Silly crashes D:
a deck?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deck_%28building%29
oh
I guess it is a deck then... I think
07ROFL

/me is pretty sure people call decks patios too though... >.>
and decks are usually raised off the ground
yes
If I had a mansion, I would want the middle to be a greenhouse practically D:

Oh, that.
it's ok Cat :p.
every wednesday
I have about 30 interiors to bloggify
Okies!
:D
30?
I meant 60 D.
Thewhat
From newest to oldest?
07fff
oldest first
02Hi TG and irene
D:
But that would cut in to the flow :o
huh?
12ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
12;v;
02What?
12VDex.
02Fangirls....
I already have 5 posts, it would be easier to flow backwards from the first one that I did post.
12:|
but beginning at the oldest ones gives a background to build from, and then you can explain design decisions that were based on earlier posts
plus, they would appear to be evolving as you kept on blogging
But they are all unrelated to eachother :o
But, I suppose I can start from the beginning and such.
on
Not really, it is seriously inconsistent.
But I suppose the interiors that were made before I lost my mind might have slight relations...
like, this week is "purple" day
or some such things

03She says she's going to Europe on business for two weeks and needs to borrow $5,000.
03The bank's president and its officers all enjoy a good laugh at The blond for using a $110,000 Benz as collateral against a $5,000 loan.
03An employee of the bank then proceeds to drive the Benz into the bank's underground garage and parks it there. Two weeks later, the blonde returns, repays the $5,000 and the interest, which comes to $15.41.
03What puzzles us is, why would you bother to borrow $5,000?"

Hi again all
02Hi RN
hi RN
hay
what's up
/me wonders why she's still CootieMonster
I just saw some trailer for an owl movie. Is it based around a series of books that you've read?
Legend of the Guardians? yup
bye eat well
That's pretty shocking, most people I talk to in the UK have seen all the films and read at least some of the books.
yeah I'm the only person that's never seen or read any of them I bet :P
not the only, but you get my point
and a watermelon
07Rocket_Ninetales!
Irene!

07How are YOU
Oh no you've just reminded me of my nosey neighbour Irene with the telescope again xD and I'm fine thanks!
07Oh telescope?
07and good^^
7File types.
7In the mass of a soundtrack, there's one file which isn't opening properly.
7It's supposed to be an MP3, but..
Sometimes it's a WMA and people have just typed mp3 to the end of it
I've had that problem, but it might not be that.
Curly!
:D
7How do I change the file type?
I usually use a sound file convertor but there may be other ways
03LOL you can't just type something at the end RN
03that doesn't actually work
03What type of file is it Quany?
13actually you can
13like this
03no...
13I like pie.
/me runs
03that doesn't change the filetype
lol ok xD but I have had that problem before where it's been reading as an MP3 file but is actually a WMA file
No I meant people just type it on the end and make other people think it's an MP3 when it isn't
7DRF; it's supposed to be an MP3.
02Back
02And a fish
7No, I mean, it's an MP3.
wb
7But it's not opening.
03then it's probably corrupted
ok fair enough, different problem to mine then

02Ray used Angryface
$300 for the shipping, or was it $600 for the cutter, $355 for the shipping? Either way, at least $300 shipping. ._.
the cd itself cost about 40p D:
02*WB03(Feather03)02WB* - <Feather> 10Kiddyland :D
Thin glass tube and whatnot.
Can fit on a desk.
/me tactically sits on Kipi
Noel Fielding comes on wearing a cape or poncho or something! o.O
And smaller than my friends' schools' Universal VLS.
"oh bristol you... cheeky little otters, how are you??"

/me squirms under Espeon

otters are adorable <3
I cannot be kitty hat

02So that's where they come from...
PETA can gdiaf.
eww, peta
they are smelly
/me has no opinion about the PETA but thinks sea kittens is dumb
How's that insulin, hipocrite?
Heh.
02Espie sat on him
Lol Bramuda Triangle
Their leader, that creepy woman, called a terrorist a fine young man.
I think they did when they first developed it.
Kipi
:3
/me hides Kipi under him
Yuush?
/me still has no opinion on the PETA
all I know is that their campaigns are a bit weird
although if they're aiming for attention they've got it
5Hi peoples~
02Hi RP
Hi (again oo3)
Because they've done that.
5 8D
sometimes I feel kind of like that's necessary
sometimes
it depends though
:3
5So how're you two?
I don't know things about PETA
?
me neither
well
5Oh huh. xD I thought maybe you were busy.
I need to leave really soon
like
2 minutes
insulin is cultured from bacteria nowadays
D:
'm saying.*
um
it used to be made by taking pig's pancreases and crushing them up and extracting it from that
that doesn't exactly mean anything
where konek, his employer, is waiting
5Where is it in relation to where the fight is?
um
Our founders were terrorists <3
5Thus why I haven't posted yet.
ok well
I think that we should respect Finland way more than we do.
thrush has an insect on his back
Curly: You're supposed to call them freedom fighters though
squish it
5Ohhh right~ 8D I can work with that.
now
I'm gonna go to work
generally any group that calls themselves freedom fighters are just as bad as everyone else >.>
5Bye~
02Huh... girls and ther DRPs...
5 /late lol
/me eyes the "freedom fighters" in Africa
5It's fun!
02-shiny
the United States of Africa >.>
02Shiny is bad
5Besides, my name here IS kind of RP4L... thus I would join the most popular roleplay on TST, yes?
02OF COURSE
5It's only /logical/.
Meh, I ain't too fond of the United States of Amurikuh.
the united states of antarctica!
:D
The North.
oh okays
5But no, it's not the name on my birth certificate. ;P
02You sound like a christie...
George Washington actually had a lot of people encouraging him to become a dictator among his army
wasn't the civil war one of the bloodiest wars in history?
5Uh, well I'm not. x3;
02Even though I haven't met any
ok I am back
Curly, heh, yeah.
5I have. And they're nothing like me.
Over 600,000 men died.
Every single one an American.
Curly: WWII had more people killed than the Civil War had people alive
I knows
Millions and millions died in WWII
She didn't say THE bloodeist.
12 8D
She said ONE of.
but that doesn't cross the Civil War out as one of the bloodiest wars in history
12Homework... dune
12done
12hai rp4l
somewhere on the top 20 list I think
The US hasn't had that many wars
02Oh Hi Starlitzone
I really think we need to disband like 90% of the US military tbh
I was just poking at the "peaceful and principled" bit
12bed soon
I don't like America much at all, military or not.
omg http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_and_anthropogenic_disasters_by_death_toll
it's not on there
I said top 20 list >.>;
oh wait
that is 20 xD
maybe top 50 then :p
:p
but that's still pretty high up
Curly: The Civil War had the most people killed on US soil than any other war
RP
:D
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_War
/me lazytime time
Cya
The US is in a position where it really doesn't need to worry about threat of invasion
or rather, "gather enough sleep to be able to function tomorrow/later today"
oh well
02Night
I'd be more worried about our own government.
Cya xF
Yeah
02Timing
Canada's kind of comfily sitting on top of America's military
Dunno
Well
Not doing it tonight
why not have a smaller, more elite army like the UK?
You're the only person that watches >.>;
12XD
12wait
12that was fail
much more sensible
http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101020/ap_on_sc/us_sci_oldest_galaxy
the US's nukes are like 50 years old
:p
I'm sure some of them won't too :p
It's not like they're just sitting in the dirt alone, military techs and whatnot.
that's pretty awesome
12night
12i have to go to sleep now
02bye
12see you guys... tomorrow?
12night
hi
Hi stryker!
hi Stryker

Hai.
hi Stryker!
HI STRYKER!
D:
/me hides.
HIII STRYKER! :O
Okay. I get it.
xD
D: Jeez.
sorry, I'm a bit hyper or something :p
I noticed. :p
/me licks Stryker
/me tackles Cat to the ground.
Lukewarm? :D
/me clings to Strkyer's side
/me tapes Cat and Stryker together
:3
:O
/me can't stand up, due to being unbalanced now.
A Cat-Stryker hybrid!
:O
Strycat or sumthin'
/me pushes Stryker and Cat off the hill of adventure
;_;
I don't do teams well.
/me rolls too!
see? teamwork!
My name would be far too long.
Strykat! :D
or Strykar! >_>
Or run away!
/me runs.
/me fails due to being attached to a rolling Cat.
No I meant me to run to avoid the wrath of the Stryker/cat D:
/me yawns
/me bites Curly.
/me is nommed
/me injects Curly with caffeine.
/me twitches
D:
/me pokes Curly with a stick.
Is it still alive?
/me does not know!
I need to sleep soon D:
I suggest staying back a few feet though.
No you don't, Cat.
/me twitches
I do though
got lectures tomorrowise
I'm going to sleep in around 2 hours

Bai!
bye O:
D:
/me cuts the tape
I'm adopting my English teacher as an imouto
xD
now I have to imagine her as a bubbly eyed anime character :p
:3
/me nods
http://gallery.mobile9.com/f/1579939/
She's awesome though
he sent her text messages about random things
xD
College is cool
"hey ms. T, I'm getting high!"
I'm on a first name basis with a lot of the people there
/me is just guessing
I'm on first name basis with all my teachers though
but... that's normal at my college
everyone's on first name basis with the teachers >.>
/me has no teachers.
/me wins.
cheater D:
Because he is Father Time.
Father Time?
Where is he?
No, he's just older than everything ever.
/me wonders why though
and it's not olive oil >.>
/me runs
/me chuckles.
>.>
/me wonders if any of them were lesbians
/me doubts it though
the lifespan of lgbt people is pretty low on average :I
/me is going to die young!
I am horrible at authoring.
/me is too.
I think the most I've ever written in one book is like...four pages?
I wrote 200+ pages.
For one story.
Plus I am not good at writing, I feel like I am rambling on. D:
/me steals some of Stryker's motivation
/me gives Curly some of it.
/me wants to try being a lesbian
It is.
Stryker: May I be a lesbian with you and Curly?
I'd like to try not being me too :O
No. D:
I can't decide on a ringtone I want.
I need to buy more things from Gamestop. >.<
*^-^*
Psh. :p
Hmm
[19:20] <Stryker> I need to buy less things from Gamestop. >.< <-- fixed O:
D:
Why less? ._.
why more D:
Why not? D:
I'm talking about console games.
I want a ps3
Come here and you can have mine. :p
O:
/me coaxes Curly into visiting.
Michigan.
/me drops by Michigan
:3
/me gives Curly her PS3.
lol, I wouldn't actually take it
;_;
/me just visits
You hate me. ._.
That isn't the point. Let's pretend you visit me and I make the PS3 a gift, just because I can. :o It all works out.
I don't even play on the PS3. <.<
that works then :O
/me is still iffy on taking the PS3
It does! :o
D:
Why now? ;_;
I don't know, I've never been good at accepting gifts >.>
It's afraid of Canadia!
/me throws the PS3 at Curly.
xD
Take the damn PS3. D:<
fine fine :p
/me runs away before she can reject it.
/me intercepts it and hands it gently to Curly
:o
/me wonders where Michigan is on the map
Somewhere!
It's uh
lol
Somewhere.
See? :D
/me wikis
Do it.
/me forgot
/me tags along with LaptopAristeo.
I could drop by on my road trip :O
^_^
/me is still planning to road trip across the continent
We can make a lesbian only club with just us three as starting members
yea really :P
four*
and LaptopAristeo I am not seeing you as a lesbian :P
mhm
unless we get a wig ? o_O
xD
There's a few other modifications needed for that to work
>:|
Drag queens can be bothersome. That's a no go, man.
o.o;
Good luck with that.
xD
except for Stryker <3
/me is a girl for Stryker
/me sharpens his bayonet
:3
I wish I had a laptop.
/me throws his netbook to Curly
/me steals a netbook for Stryker
And my own room.
Not really.
that sucks :I
I share it with my three step sisters.
It's... bleh. <.<
Ow
:o
/me equips sunglasses.
/me taps Stryker's sunglasses
/me casts Heal on Stryker's eyes.
welcome back DT~!
._. Please don't break them.
thanks Curly
I didn't break them, I tapped them D:
/me hides again.
hmmm
I kind of wish I could shuffle :<
I think he means like an MP3 player.
Clearly.
I wish I could play songs with having no screen, yes, right from my face.
/me shuffles Stryker
That'd be epic, Proto.
HI
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfSIcx1YgVE
jumpstyle makes you look rather seizureistic imo.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGAatCB4KCw&feature=related Good one also.
Although them dancing infront of traffic to disrupt it at the end is kinda stupid an rude.
the dancers I mean
for standing in the middle of the road of course
I like Fluro's pants
it's called singing!
AHA!
hi :O
/me leaps out and startles everyone
hello
there is a lot of people that think music comes out of there A** Curly :P
^Curly
well, judging by some people's singing *coughs and points at herself* I wouldn't be too surprised >.>
TeeHee, Curly.
how is everyone else?
alright
you ?
Horrible.
:O
/me hugss Stryker
why are you horrible?
:O
/me hugs back.
Just not feeling well, health wise.
Sleep takes care of that
go sleep
Plus having a problem with a friend doesn't help. ._.
D:
No
I'm not slee- *falls asleep*
oh, you are having issues with a friend?
Yeah.
:p Not quite to that extent.
Just some mindless arguing.
It's to the point where I'm not even sure anymore.
/me pokes Cat
oh, thats never good
/me pets Cat
Possible boyfriend, but I'm not sure. Eh.
:O
/me keeps her Stryker all to herself
mien
>_<
/me offers...something?
/me bans Curly from contacting Kata ever
/me puts Kata on the blackballed list
I haven't talked to that jackass in ages.
well, you should explain to him that because he is a male, he should be sorry and apologize. Also note how he needs to apologize at random points in the day, for anything or nothing, just to cover all his bases
the urge to talk to Kata has gone away
Okay good
/me puts Kata on a tiny spaceship and shoots him into deepsace.
sometimes the girl needs to apologize too you know, it's not like girls can't handle responsability
It even makes me cringe when I see people talking about talking to Kata
I'd apologize but... uh...
some person
anyone care to tell me via PM?
Drama queen.
Well, no
There, I summed it up in two words. :D
Basically, he has BPD
I forgot emo, but I guess that falls under drama queen.
BPD people are messed up
Bi-Polar Disorder?
It's not his fault, his personality is just wired wrong
/me supposedly has BPD. <.<
borderline personality disorder
Oh
Pfeh.
:/
He has bipolar too, no?
it's pretty much on the same level as sociopathy in psychiatric circles
incurable
and hard to deal wiht
I know this is wrong, but people with mental issues should be put on a no breed list. they can bang, they just can't breeed
I was like, don't talk to him, he's BPD
But does anyone listen to me? noooooooo
:)
Be quiet, LaptopAristeo. :P
^_^
those kinds of mental illnesses aren't genetic
Agreed, Annual. >.>
Where were you when I was 'friends' with him? D:
and they're not really illnesses
Hah.
pretty much xD
sure works for him :P
This gum has lost it's flavor :<
:(
psychiatric "disorders" are really just personalities that aren't compatible society
Proto needs moar gum, STAT!
not illnesses
But it made me interesting :D
it's not a disorder if it doesn't actually harm anything
hmm
that's the definition of disorder :O
well
sociopathy itself isn't inherently a disorder
my thoughts tend to psychologically harm others
since many socipaths are very sane
maybe *too* sane
yeah
I was bout to say that
Sociopatha are way too damned logical
:3
sociopaths*
I'm probably a little sociopathic
we all are
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKp1c9qVWxI&feature=related
LOL
oh hai capslock
well, if you empathize with anybody, or feel sorry for something you've done, you're not a sociopath
hmm
Oh cool, I'm not a sociopath.
Since I feel bad for *everything* I do.
sociopaths are rare
I am just barely not a sociopath
Even if it doesn't harm anyone. :p
my not sociopathathy(sp) applies only to animals
it's just sociopathy :p
kitties are cute!
/me hands DT a shovel
start digging
I can't stand to see food thrown away either
D:
leave it
I am ok without it
/me insists
/me digs for DT.
/me offers some Taco Bell to everyone
thar be buried treasure next to it
:D
mmm, food
:D
:D
omg Taco Bell
TACO BELL!!!!
^_^
/me eats it ALL
xD
my desk seems like, 4 times bigger since i put my tower on the floor o.O
/me demands driving directions to Ari's location
lol
/me comes back and sees he missed free food :<
anybody build a lot of PC's?
but I don't build lots of them >.>
I built mine and have upgraded various others
:3
I built mine.
/me just takes apart her computers and maintains them and puts them back together again
I build a lot yea
/me steals Curly's disc drive.
too many to the point its a drain on my wallet >_<
D:
/me steals 9 of them.
D:
Annual, I can turn on my netbook, does that count? :D
And a half.
9 1/2
I'm using like 6 T_+T
DT might know whether or not this case is useable then
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811147098
lol
time to rip some cds
oh
Multimedia, with occasional RTS gaming
it's microATX, just buy a motherboard to that standard
the graphics card I want to slip in it is low profile and has HDMI out
does it have a slot for a pci-e graphics card?
>_<
I feel like I'm going to be sick
it probably won't even be able to fit a good graphics card :I
yea it does
has to be a low profile
it is
is that like, a single-slot card?
mine takes up two D:
but I don't know how much I would trust that Power supply with a vid card
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814141119
the cheap PSUs they put in some of these cases can't handle all that much
oh, yeah, generally you'd want like a 500watt power supply for gaming
my graphics card is pretty much the opposite of low-profile
at least
I think
same Cat lol
/me hasn't been keeping up to date
/me is waaaay behind.
/me shuts up.
should be ok
I think I'll just stick to lasers.
I'd like a bigger case with more cooling
Annual, were you considering buying that rosewill case?
as long as the PSU is not total crap
yes, I was, why?
I guess check up on the reviews and see if you see a lot of complaints about it
the PSU that is
Annual, it's a piece of crap, don't.
wouldn't a slim computer case be worse at cooling?
why?
Annual, if you're getting a decent PSU, why pay for the $50 shitty case?
yea of course Curly
yeah, Lu's right >.>
Annual, because rosewill makes crappy cases.
And mice.
my case is by Coolermaster!
same
and cost me £30
well both of my main ones are
D:
the case I was looking at was a coolermaster one too >.>
and a Antec
and a AeroCool
does having the tower on top of the desk or below the desk make any difference to airflow?
trust me on this one lol
but, the other cases are soooooo much more expensive!
lemme read the reviews
it wasn't actually the interior of the case itself, that was fine, but I took the front cover off it and it was just crammed >.>
the worst I have ever seen is the computer I built for my ex .... a year later
yeah, this was like a 15 year old computer
she never cleaned it and it looked like a cat or something blew up in there xP
and I'm sure no one's *ever* taken the front cover off it
XD
he is young
Hahahahahahahah.

/me passes the link on
/me blinks at huge link
That link isn't large.
Really.
It is on my screen D:<
Agreed Curly
oooh, minimalist
I wants
/me stares at Curly.
mmhm
I was looking at this http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811119230
links?
I am never think they are made well enough
liiike
D:
that link wasn't long at all!
Doors would probably get annoying for me
YouTube's failed me T_T
even if I barely use the drive bays
Or this thing
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811103039
Ewwww the fans change colors
yuck I don't like the xclios
Annual, http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817190027
was junk all around
Heh, I was pointing out the overninethousand fans
that's the cheapest good PSU on the site.
subtlety people!
http://www.coolermaster-usa.com/product.php?category_id=19&product_id=2986 <-- yea thats my main case
hey O:
Haha there's a <5" 12v psu
I think that's the exact same case I was looking at
yeah, it's like 3 feet tall and nearly a foot wide >.>
yea its a awesome case
and that power supply is totally overkill for someone running a low end system, sorry to say
I still think level ten is the stupidest case ever.
I like tight aluminum cases with a smooth finish
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811133089
http://www.mini-box.com/s.nl/it.A/id.417/.f
That PSU :D
/me adds the improved PSU to his list and stands back
>_<
http://www.silentpcreview.com/article601-page1.html
/me prances away from DT.
not too bad still, just $570
lol
Annual, hey, did you get that link I put there for you?
yes, that price I just listed is with the PSU added
This is where I first saw it: http://short-circuit.com/product/picoPSU-90.html
Annual, and if you think $100 is too much for a PSU, then you shouldn't pay more than $300 for the entire system.
I was looking for a 3.5A, 36V PSU.
I never said 100 is too much for a PSU
I am going for quality with a minimal profile without sacrificing functionality too much
and there is a lot of good PSUs for under $100
Annual, minimal profile? why is that a good thing?
http://thepcmdaz.com/images/hpa305w.JPG
there's my case :D
Annual, the wattage isn't as important as the efficiency rating
minimal profile means it can sit on the glass shelving units above my HDTV and not look unsightly
http://pastebin.com/4RQdYHvf
that is the full parts listing
excluding input devices and software
yeah
is the 52-inch screen 1080p?
yes
Goodbye.
it'd be nice if they could have higher resolutions and just keep 1080p for 22-24" screens really
wait
no, I watch a lot of things in 1080P, does not seem to suffer much
if at all
when you're sat on a sofa you're far away enough to not see any aliasing anyway
Yeah
I sit within 4 feet of the screen
off to the side
seeya Proto
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813121399
why not just buy a computer monitor for a 22"-24" screen?
the first time I saw a "high definition" monitor I was kind of disappointed
I've not seen any monitors with a higher resolution than 1920x1080 that wasn't ridiculously expensive :/
because I do not need a desktop computer? I want this to be my home theater comp
Cat, 1920x1080 isn't the same thing as 1080p
really Curly?
I don't know anything about tvs D:
there's a reason computer monitors aren't termed in something p
p stands for progressive scan
most computer monitors don't even work that way
my two monitors are 1920x1080, then
one is 22", the other is 24"
yeah
there's a reason why an 80" computer monitor is $50,000 and an 80" tv monitor is only $1000 :p
Annual, I was just talking about Cat's comment
you can buy 80" computer monitors??
yes
$1,000 is a lot of money. ._. (</back for a bit>)
o.O
there was one on NewEgg
well
you'd probably sit it far away
DX
poor Curly
/me was reading scrollback when DT left
reading and replying to >_>
wait, when did Stryker leave? D:
The 65" monitors are averaging $,7000
Stryker left?
D:
about 15 minutes ago, apparently
18 past

http://jmirc.sf.net/jmIrc.jad (case sensitive
\o/
/me hugs Stryker?

DL
D:(
D:**
/me leaves too
sorry, no I haven't D:
._.;
:O CURLY CANT LEAVE
mwahaha
/me is just distracted by researching piercings
ooo
/me was thinking she'd go by the same rules as looking for a tattoo parlour and she's pretty much right
i didnt think they did
they heal in like a month
I'm too much of a wimp for piercings. lol
lol that doesnt sound very fast
/me thought Curly meant a week or 2 :p
nuh uuh
uh huh!
I guess if you're gonna create a hole in yourself... That's a pretty good amount of time.
/me pierced her ear
me too!
/me didn't not!
/me is odd. ._.
and my right ear still isn't totally healed
I didn't either D:
:O
We can be odd together!
the average healing time for an ear lobe piercing is about 4-6 monhts
:O NOOOWAAAAY
yesway
show me :o
well I could tell you from experience
http://www.youngwomenshealth.org/body-piercing.html
there's also that
Pfft. Experience doesn't mean anything.
I had to clean my piercings every single day for like a month or else they'd get crusty from blood
i did the same but not for as long :o
maybe i am superhuman :p
Huh, the male genitalia is faster than the navel
...
o.o
Wha...
now that i find hard to believe
In healing time D:
lots of blood going around there
Oh
>.>
>_<
XD
I don't want to know how else that sentence could be read =P
<.<
/me coughs.
/me didn't think there'd be any other ways to read it ._.;
There probably aren't
If they didn't click the link it might not make sense.
oooh
But... I clicked the link...
well yeah that would have been weird if it was out of context :p
pfft, you can pierce ur own body.
mmz i dunno
i pierced one ear one day and the other the next
then it was healed in approx a week
:3
I hate songs that bring back memories
/me too
http://wimp.com/petowl/
I hate the song best friend by Jazon Mraz.
That works too. \o/
:3
And I was like......
Baby baby baby OHHHHHHHHHHH
. . .
I'm sorry
Forget I said that
D:
okays, research complete!
I don't know you anymore.
/me cries

and I can't access my wifi settings without signing in or something
Hm, maybe I should throw on some tunes
I can't access anything without signing in or something >_>
an htc mytouch (aka magic)
3g, not the slide
rogers?
I had a magic once.
/me is listening to One Step Closer by Linkin Park from Hybrid Theory (Bonus Track Version).
Ive owned a lot of android phones.
no, it's a t-mobile
I bought it specifically because the mytouch (but not the magic) is compatible with... yeah
I'm planning to
figured
I just got it today
why else would you get an incompatible phone lol
/me is listening to ~Never Turn Back - Crush 40~
wind's coverage sucks though,
Nice
it's good enough for me
I'm just trying to figure out how to get into my phone without signing in >_>
because I can't even access my wifi settings without signing in
XD
you can
Can never like it.
how?
ive done it a hundred times
:(
Don't even try to force it on me
you should be able to access wifi settings by clicking menu
I'll shrug it off like sc2
and selecting wifi settings
if not do a 4 corner tap
but there is no menu button for wifi in there
4 corner tap?
when I hit menu and go into the wireless settings it just shows me "find network" and "automatically choose network"
as in 3g networks
hmm
strange
thats the only song most people know about from daft punk. XD
or the kayne west remix
when it tells you to signin
>_<
there shouldbe an option to skip it
skip the signin after the tutorial
ive done that before
ther's no skip button there
02yeah
I'm assuming the mytouch has a different version of the os
1.5 i think
I'm just waiting for Tron 2's soundtrack.
/me now belongs to Kosovo for 5 minutes
I think the mytouch is supposed to be upgradeable to 2.2
that'll be their first "album" in a while
@ IdleRPG
I can't wait
Thumbed up, and faved, Kosovo. Now to Inspiration (RECON remix). :P
/me runs
Also ff
02but my favorite song of all timez is: ~Escape from the city - Crush 40~ , and ~TTFAF (If you don't knoe i'll kill you ;D)~
oh hang on O:
just found a section to add an APN.. does that include wifi networks?
No.
rofl
Of course, yeah. xD
XD
/me is poking around in there
No, you f***ing idiot, it was the worst thing ever, you suck, and I hate you for subjecting me to this FLITH.
XD
That's the thing with music
no
apn != wifi

Me too.
Mercury lol

And bromine sometimes.
yes
But mercury is cooler.
isn't bromine a nonmetal?
but I didn't think it had any metallic properties. O_o
Yeah, but its melting point is room temperature-ish.
Or wait

Mecury is poisonus

right, it's bromine.

Br-
Halogen is a cool word.
lol
I think my favorite element though
"wanna get up on some halogens tonight bro?"
is technetium.
it's like
cooool
It has both an awesome name and it's radioactive.
For just no reason.
XD
but technetium is like "yeah whatever :|"
lol
sad

pfffffffffffft
you can block that with a piece of paper. :P

lol yeah
no
yeah
really. :'(
like
bh
Bohrium
:'(
lol :(
Poor Bohr.
and it's named after one of the most important guys in all of chemistry
created the bohr model that I used all the time.
irony ftw. lol
XD
worse
its WAY more stable
*succeeding
lol
I heard some isotopes have half-lives of like, a few milliseconds maybe. rofl
typos
ugh
oh yeah
that's why you can discover prolly thousands upon thousands of isotopes/elements
and have it not mean much
lol inorite
It's like
since the more elections you add, and the more you add to the nucleus
XD
They're sitting at expensive computers
nerds.
the lot of them.
and making a bigger one
just long enough to say it existed
02http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcBm78rpbnI
then it breaks down.
lol neutrinos
they are amazing
I should make an element
that breaks down before it's even made. XD
rofl
They've already made MendelBohorCopernicusium
XD
too bad, I had some hope there
But then it's still considered the same element :(
i know
but it would last even LESS
lol
8)
I'm a nerd with tons of money and something to prove
and be my own master.
I was being facetious about the money thing XD
but if I did have all the money i could want
rofl
i would just start disspointing aspiring scientists
I'd pay for college XD;
by constantly raising the bar
and crushing their hopes and dreams
you know
ethical goals with no conflict of interest. :D
lol, yes
I'd have someone check on my crack theories.
I know how they work, but I were to actually explain it to you, it'd take a few decades
literally. @_@
they aren't holes
they are collasped stars with practically infinite density
:D
well
anything with mass that starts to approach the speed of light
My guess is it still moves at the speed of light, but the speed of light changes because of the spacetime dilation.
would become heavier and heavier, and denser
02Night
lol, yeah.
02good night kosovo
Something interesting too:
There IS a solution to division by zero
02WAT?
Yep, that's prolly it
time is a dimension
it's technically infinity
but anything can become finite if you are an ultra genius. :P
well
but it's a solution
if an imaginary one
then again
and no one's done that yet for 1/0 :(
Well
much like infinity isn't.
oo
But any operation on infinity is infinity, whereas you can still perform operations on i.
And get something that's not i, I mean.
like i^2 or i^4
lol
well, those come out to real numbers
like
!voice
Dang it.
if you took -50^1/2
you could simplify it
using both real and imaginary numbers
I guess inf/inf could evaluate to 1, but inf * inf would be like lolwut.
-is
rofl yeah
or inf/inf for that matter
Which I'm pretty sure would blow up the universe.
that's the problem, I don't think you can divide by infinity
XD
rofl
even with itself
since
infinity has no exact value
then again, mabye
LOL
factorial FTW
seriously
like
but like
I think my calculator overflows at like 70! rofl
Which is exactly why infinity can't be defined, lol :(
or divide by 1. XD
or multiply by 1.
Unless you're a 32-bit CPU and can't count higher than 4294967295.
now I'm just spewing basic algebraic properties, lol
lol
XD
supercomputers that can perform trillions of calculations per second
still can't even get close to factorial
lol, yeah
XD
lol yeah
not even using exponents raised to exponents
the most you can do
is list the ten digits or something. XD
lol yeah
And the up arrows.
it's like
that's all I get out of it lol
I can't even comprehend that system. O_Oo
the best i can do is exponents raised to exponents, lol
same here, hence why I can't read it. lol
All I see is arrows.
googol doesn't even cut it
googol is like nothing lol
10^10, lol
Child's play
yeah
Even Googolplex is nothing
even like 344353453453453! is nothing
10^googol
It's probably as close to infinity as we've gotten lol
not even
when we think of numbers like googol
that
I can't think of any quantity in the universe
of like
ANYTHING
that equals googol
even the amount of atoms that exist
The amount of atoms observable, at least. lol
and antimatter/dark matter, i guess
lol yeah
Things that aren't atoms.

65 billion ONLY?
Apparently. lol
Maybe that might tear apart the universe
yes
apparently it does now XD
I'm already sick of it lol
lol
it is interrupting our nerdular nerdence.
spam the fourms
inb4 destruction of both. XD
And yes, Armads
we should not let cone disturb our nerdy discussion. XD
lol
but anyway
like
log (-1)
=best expression ever
lol
/me ponders
Sigma's a cool looking operator. lol
I pretty much like anything with that in it.
lol yeah
no one ever talks about it
I always get those mixed up lol
yes, i think
it is the natural logarithm
All I know is that like, every other digit is an 8. lol
Oh wait, the other one is Euler's *constant*.
whats up
...
anyone on?
lol
Logarithms are awesome.
.....
:/
Especially about condensing/expanding them
The only experience I have with them is with bit calculations. lol
And even then I didn't know it was a logarithm.
like you can write log3 (x+1) - log3 (y-8) as log3 (x+1/y-8)
and that's the extremely simple example, lol
Or I'm probably mixing that up somehow because I never really learned it XD
XD
calculators can be totally retarded sometimes, lol
uhmmm...
That should be as high as I need to go without some kind of tool.
At which point I can just do 2^n or something.
I like how most of the math I know is related only to programming. lol
I need to learn some l33t programming skills from you, lol.
rofl
Do you play any instruments?
not particularly, besides like a harmonica and clarinent, lol
rofl
That's one more instrument than me XD
I can play the piano to some degree, but only because it's a lot like typing. rofl
or rather, I think of it like typing.
XD
am i the only one on?
Hmm ... Is anyone here?
that's awesome
whats up
physics?
Hey.
Only physics as it relates to games, mind you XD
Yes, I am.
Yeah.
I don't get why, though.
i k now right
This is called "SpyroChat
"
haha yeah
Yes, I do.
nice
also RK4 is like my favorite name for a formula ever.
Xbox 360
oh
Sorry man.
The confusion.
oh
ha dont trip
I won't
anyway iv got a PS3 and please dont mistake me for a fanboy
lol
Aah, a PS3.
nice i just got home from walmart
lol you dont like ps3s?
unlike mine.
Do you play it?
yeah
Mine has been rendered absolutely pathetic by budget cuts
Alright.
Working where?
let alone classes for, like programming
*like,
Or is it school related?
i make invatations
lol :(
Doesn't mean I didn't hate high school lol
18
In fact I think I hated it because it was too easy.
You should be fine, then.
I didn't mind hating high school necessarily
*mean
Wow, I need to update my age on my profile.
how old r u?
It says 17[3/4] years old. I'm 19.
nice
I meant actually being able to start attaining skills for a career in high school
when ur birthday?
I haven't updated my profile in about 1.25 years.
That I didn't do at all XD
dang
and yeah, high school is too easy for the most part. lol :/
Sep. 9th
9-9-91
My high school(s) were like, soooo boringly easy and pointless.
ha thats kinda tipy
ABout 3 months ago, yes.
Most everything I learned during those four years I was just learning on my own time. lol
That's an odd date.
y?
'Cause I sure as heck didn't spend that time doing homework. XD
.'/
ha
sometimes not always
Great.
lol
:/
I know this is unrelated with regards to education
but is the college atmosphere the same as high school?
Not this college, that's for sure at least.
Oh, alright.
The people here have personality, for one thing.
I'm going to update my profile in a second.
ight
I've loved Spyro and the Spyro games since I was 9.
yeah like- kinda/big fan/EXTREAM
I began playing them when I was 8 or 9.
We don't have those annoying one-armed desks either.
Extreme.
I hated those.
ha same here i played Spyro from a demo Pizza hut gave out
I guess you could say.
...and still do lol
nice same here i just dont like the 1st ps2 spyro games
lol
because
like
bbl
oh
if people in college developed that same stupid-as-hell social ladder that exists in high school
then I wouldn't even bother
Yeah i dont hate it, i like the story... kinda
There's still a bit of a social ladder here, but it's more like
Aah, yes.
YEAH
i got it on my ps3
Even the teachers here aren't all that much different from the students.
You can talk to them and joke around with them just like anyone else.
haha i understand not liking the wii
rofl, not at this school XD
But that's cool that you had professors that were relatable
yeah i got Spyro 1 2 and 3 for the ps1 on the ps3
In fact only one of my teachers was even over 50.
Most are probably in their 30s or younger.
Wow, really? O_o
Really XD
had it on my psp but i cant play games while i am moving i get sick
You seriously can't spot them in a crowd.
That's the age range at my school for the most part actually
but in a college?...I didn't expect that. O_o
i bet you need some kind of gaming computer or a high tec computer
If it weren't for the color of their lanyards, they'd blend in perfectly with the students.
for teachers, i mean
I don't.
Heck, some of the supervisors there *are* students XD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8v7UOXxF0c&feature=related
lol
that was how i got my 1st spyro
where people are easily relatable to one another
regardless of age/position
yeah, it's awesome here.
That's basically my dream college, lol
Like, one of my teachers this month just reformatted his computer
its cool i dont get a tec into computers anyway
just photoshop
"Embedding disabled by request."
Like, before he even installed his work software or an antivirus.
aww wack
XD
Wow
that is awesome.
like
I can't imagine my spanish teacher EVER doing that. XD
*past
rofl
I clicked "Pop Out" and I got to watch it.
yea
Well
And Tetris.
Awesome.
in terms of hertiage and blah blah
I don't think any of my high school teachers even played games.
but the atmosphere sucks
not sure
lol :(
Oh, alright.
I know you live in Florida and all
but
When people say there are budget cuts in californian schools
they MEAN it to the highest degree
D:
I should know, I'm in our school's asb.
Alright.
yeah its 10:37
I take part in managing our fiances and whatnot.
It's 12:37 AM here in Texas.
??
!!
a lot of the money actuallly comes from our own pockets
fail D:
yeah
Ca but i used to live in HOUSTON TX
it's that bad
Oh.
I'm about 2 hours SouthWest.
like
i also lived in Tomball tx
San Antonio.
it's part of the reason why people nowadays don't even care. :/
the droppout rate is increasing rapidly
I never got involved with anything in grade school because I never cared enough.
iv been there i was in citywalk, when to sea world and saw the alamo
I never felt like school was doing anything for me.
its dope
yeah
Are you a city person, suburbs person, or country person?
same here
Granted I didn't drop out, but I did hate it enough to want to. lol
all of them
i move... ALOT
Aah, okay.
and you??
D:
I'm more of a country person, but dislike country music and live in the suburbs.
In fact
just today, we were totally yelled at in our asb period
ha same i hate country (besides Johny Chase's song Wont Back Down)
And Cration.
because they were fed up
yeah i like nature but i also know it has a deadly side and i can never keep that out of my head
XD :(
that's awesomely horrible lol
lol, yeah.
and she blamed us for the whole school's problems
or at least partly
lol
Not like you'd hop onto a raft and chill out in an alligator-infested swamp.
haha i have (believe it or not) IN SAN ANTONIO
no joke complete accident
12switching to DSi
same, but I'm in this job, and I gotta commit to it. lol
12BBLs
12<again>
not raft tho it was a cano
You can try coming to this college XD
XD
okay armads
when i get the money to move to the other side of the country. XD
Oh, I was getting worried.
ha
oh
It was in three separate parts for its installation. Three separate downloads.
or I can move to, like, nepal
They took about an hour + each to download for that one mod.
and learn yoga
lol
but nah
Battlefield 1942.
oh neverplayed it
do you know how to hack COD: MW2
?
In the city I live in, there are TONS of yoga classes/centers
I just don't wanna spend the money. XD
/me hates Call of Duty.
rofl, fair enough.
I can just use Thisgamesux to hack it if I wanted to.
/me back

I did actually want to get back into martial arts sometime.
tys
Since the most exercise I get nowadays is carrying groceries to my house XD;
servers? lack of creativity?
perks?
I've played it and clocked many hours of gameplay in them before figuring out that I hate them.
I'm a brown belt.
/me lols
haha same here
CoD 2, 3, 4, and 6.
i dont hate them i just think that its not all that good
*kwon
XD
wb kipi
Cod:MW- WAW- MW2-Black ops
I dabbled in tang soo do at one point too.
'lo, Kosovo.
And hap ki do.
and like a ton of other things
but never got far XD
/me growls
XD
it froze
on me 2 times

anyway
Just being a yellow belt proves you've tried, at least.
I'm a black-belt
but
... But I do like the Zombies mode.
physically weak oxo
the worst we get is elevating
lol
i suck at Zombies
I'm flexible tho~
I actually USED my tae kwon do knowledge once.
Wellm skilled or not, it could be quite fun. But I enjoy Halo's "Flood" more.
I can kick about as high as my face but that's it. lol
It was hilarious/terrifying
you got halo Reach?
Yes.
I was actually being pinned down in this alley
and when I was able to break free
/me ...

rofl :(
I agree.
I think I saw blood.
I got bruises every night
I was @karate
Never seen him again
lol
its cool but i hate how only the alians can dodge row
I had no idea why he pinned me down in the first place, lol
row?
maybe it was because he wanted my groceries. XD
rofl
if they had that spartens should have also had an exclusive
evade
yams are pretty valuable
Oh.
hey, muggers need to eat too :P
yams are awesome.
YES.
Elites had evade since Halo 1.
Yams=best thing ever
lol
It's part of their character and personality.
lol
Very fast bullets.
elites can do that too
Excluding the Needle Rifle.
I'm making canolis tomorrow
(love that gun)
*cannolis
:o
I'm gonna try my hand at mochi again once I get the proper tools.
I think Spartans just have more brute force, but I have always like elites more.
XD
No, sorry.
But i do like them.
Mortar and pestle=epic
Even if I fail at it, those things make a heck of a kitchen ornament.
I have watched my friend play them quite a few times, and have played it myself a few times.
like "check me out, I have a f*cking MORTAR AND PESTLE because I'm such a gangsta."
XD
Yes, it is.
I should tell that to the gangs that live in my neighborhood, lol.
rofl
"Hey, motherf******s"
"What?"
"What?"
real useful
"A MOTHERF****** MORTAR AND PESTLE."
SH*T JUST GOT REAL
Rice is awesoooome.
again just asking for the sake of asking
Theoretically it should still taste like rice.
All in middle school.
theoretically, of course.
We all know how theories end up working out. lol
lol
you never know. :o
Theoretically I should have been able to grind rice with my hands. XD
ouch that hurt lol
Not to be mean to you.
You cannot deny the rice.
XD
Some people grow up in an environment like that. I feel bad for those people.
I was denied by the rice
Sure, I'll listen.
it asserted its authority over me and I was powerless to resist.
well i was born in San Branidino CA
But, it was a fierce and delicious struggle.
if resistance was actually possible
[read]
but when i turned to a teen ager i moved to tombal tx
the rice would have to take sh*t into it's own hands. :/
but it doesnt have to.
its own very sticky and pasty hands.
thats when i was introduced to Racism
Oh, alright.
Possibly, lol.
I know you can probably make chaulk out of it. XD
I should order a larger bag of it next time and play around with it more. lol
lol
That's terrible.
Two pounds just isn't enough it seems.
yeah sucked
You need a googol amount of it.
anyway my parents broke up and i moved
in kilograms.
to Houston Tx
yeah
That's nice at least.
XD
Yes, it's like that.
they had a gang or click
I only think of things using customary units, even when I know the metric system. lol
miles>kilometers in my brain
My skin color made me a target
lol
You didn't try to get in, did you?
Oh.
but it was my homie puff that got stabed
Did he live?
lol :(
envornment
and I have to get to school earlier than usually tomorrow...so... XD
not contentment
lol, I can relate
School sucks, honestly.
for the most part
High school yeah D:
It would do the same for me. I would probably just leave that place.
well, g'night bromine o/
lol
/me shot
XDDDDDDDDDDDD
that is hilarious
rofl
anyway, night armads XD
my homies and me always stuck close to one another
Yeah.
i know right :)
night lol
Of that gang?
not a gang
or at least i didnt mean to make one
That sucks.
yeah
Diana
she was everything to me
Because you're 18, are you in college, out of school, or still in Senipr High
?
Okay.
her not them
Get the gun.
didnt have one
but that does come into play later
i looked at her... i saw the mess they made out of someone i truly cared about
No ... .'/
.'/
: )
he didnt even straggle anymore
i was scared out of my mind thinking every cop as out looking for me
but he lived it was just my mind pushing my worst fear
He may have been found by his friends.
yeah he was...
weeks later
Now I'm worried again.
i was walking down the same park to go home
... even worse.
with my younger brother
I'd be runnung.
*running
when in turned the corner and drove slowly
then not when
the passenger shot at us
me and my brother got low laying down taking cover from some hills
i thought the bullet was going to go through the grass like butter and kill me but it didnt
They must've been 9mm rounds.
)
They could have ...
i should have thought about it, but i didnt
It's hard to think in a situation like that. I know I wouldn't be able to./
I might have died.
i soon found my self out numbered my body on the hard street
they all took shots at my jaw and ribs
(my jaw is still messed up and pops out of place from time to time)
Internal bruising.
yeah i had that
my friends came to my aid
took me to a hospital and everything
Crap.
Was it bleeding?
my responce was
"aww shit for how long?
I'm just glad they didn't shoot you ... the gang.
Was it automatic or semi-auto?
[the weapon]
Oh.
anyone still here
yo
oh hi
what's up
home
Great.
bleh
essay
you?
I'm sicker than ever
and she moved me out to Ontario Ca with my sister
yeah
To a safer place.
D:
yeah way safer but i wasnt in my envornment any more
I'm glad you got moved out of there, personally.
thanks
i still want to go back
my friends... they where like brothers to me...
and revenge is another thing on my list... Mexicans out there still getting gutted for that stupid gang
Wow.
I understand.
Maybe that's a good thing.
i just get updated by my homie chito everytime someone dies.
slowly the wound heals
I hope you don't mind me sharing this.
Hold a sec ...
alright
http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205:38-42&version=NLT
There's always Forgiveness, though.
and i knew you would give the the word of the bible
Is that a bad thing?
Oh.
but its something i TRULY need
but i am his follower
I hear you. I have thought that before. I've hated someone, unfortunately.
But decide to let it go.
good
I've put saws up to people's neck. It's not something to enjoy talking about.
have you killed?
In my head, yes. In the material world, I'm glad I have not.
Here's something I am glad about:
I grew up in a family of worship leaders.
Nice
I have one sibling, a sister. She joined her first worship band in her high school year before I joined my first band.
in elementary school,
i think we all go through that stage
Yeah.
Crap, forgot.
When I was young, My best friend was Spyro.
Anyway ...
.'/
Dang!
I plan on going to college and becoming a worship pastor or something related to that.
nice
My sister grew up with me as my role model.
She was always showing me how to be nicer to people.
Wait ... I was the one that enjoyed hitting her. Crap.
jst askin but is ur sister still alive?
/me can't think straight
Yes.
She's 20
/me understands
My main point ...
She began dating my friend's brother a few months back, then about two weeks ago found that she was pregnant.
My parents and I then found out that most of her relationship was a sexual relationship. Not only do I distrust her now, but I lost my role model.
dang
that sucks
She had a miscarriage.
Never have i been in any situation like that with family
NO...
Apparently.
She was bleeding a lot last week.
do you think it was a miscarriage?
yeah pregnacy makes people vonarable
Heheh.
how many mounts was she in?
Mounts?
yeah
Not sure. All I know is that she got prego and lost the baby.
dang that sucks...
She's fine now. She's working as a baby-sitter and going to college to later become a math teacher.
oh
Yeah.
Math Teacher :(
i dislike mather teachers....
lol
Why not a rifle? they pack more of a punch.
dude i got to get some sleep i got school tomarrow
Remington makes reliable 12-guages.
(school sucks)
I need sleep too.
I have nothing to do tomorrow.
: )
NOT always but i do from time to time
I have not been here in a few weeks. Something was telling me to get on.
Or someone.
Anyway, good night.
yeah maybe
L8er

You know, I don't know if you seen them before but in the early 1990's, it was all European and Japanese buses
And we all know
Japan > China
I second that
you shouldnt even be comparing Japan to a piece of crap country with crap people living in it. :o

Above my Pokémon collection too D:
i see
Amyway
yup?
I see that the biggest problems with China are
1. They steal, but don't innovate
2. They are generally lazy leeches
3. They have no qualms in harming the environment...
and killing animals
4. ...and supporting tyrant regimes like Burma's
truely, they deserve to be annihilated, every single one of em
Ancient China was OK-awesome
I don't think they need to be destroyed
But rather
then? o.o
relearn their old ways
and from Taiwan and Hong Kong
their too lazy too, I believe
to&

Taiwan, not quite
Hong Kong too
and, their good at cheating people, you forgot to add that
Oh yes that
I got scam calls from China before

How long was the demo?
It never stopped
Grrrr
I had to leave before it was over
oh
Last week it was fine

and finding hidden unlockables and paths
yeah
I'm definately getting it now
/me is getting Epic Yarn
Epic Mickey
Rune Factory Oceans
^
you should
Rune Factory Oceans
It's on both the PS3 and Wii in Japan I believe
yes
Heard, but never wondered
I wondered
because I'm a Harvest Moon/Rune Factory fanboy
....
I tend to like series that have their share of faults
no
sadly not
I don't have any Rune Factory games,yet
which is strange, me being a fanboy of it and all
lol
I've played Rune Factory 2 on the DS
it's a pretty decent rpg
but I hope to get 3, Frontier, and Oceans soon
cool
I'll have to get it as well
although apparently no one knows that it's coming out besides me, judging from the reactions of people I tell that to. XD
I knew it was coming out
That was one of the first games I ever played.....

:(
Yeah, I'm in that of a bad mood today
Oh.

Also I'm looking at bids on YT on how to EV train
13o3o
13EV train is easy, but it can be hard to understand at first |D
04lul
04Aurora
6well
Oh no wait you mean the one you made?
6yes that one
13Also, brb
Yeah I saw that :)
6yep
04...
04>>
6lol
@ angel Espeon HOOOOOOOOOOOOWWW?!
;-;
13I can try to explain when I get back, if someone else doesn't beat me to it xD
it's doing my nut in on this ev training lark
6well
DOES
NOT
COMPUTE!!!
6getting up that many points involves held items, nature, characteristic, base stats, and level
It's like my starter totodile beating lances dragonitr XD
Hmm ok
I'm thinking of getting the speed raising brace with my BP
but I only have 16 BP
Wb
13brought my food with me :P
here ya go!
13For EV training, I just use a macho brace and pokerus
:o
13Well
I do have a macho brace tho
13and I'm offering to give anyone pokerus with each trade as well :P
/me hugs Raine
/me hugs
13Nah, pokerus is just an added bonus that makes EV training go by a lot faster
Hmm ok
13it's easier to understand when you have someone explain it to you, as a few of my friends have told me
13wait
13I mean
13EV training
13xD
13but yeah
13well, that's basically it :P
Pokerus is an STD that's beneficial to you.
Creepy I know
/me flops
But when I levelled up I got only two ev points :/
13I've noticed it starts off slow, but you make more progress the more you keep it up
I know all that but I just don't seem to be doing it right
Hmm my Lucario is 170 something in speed
Maxed
13if they don't, you still have EV points to spare :P
Where are they?
13Blackthorn City
K
Yeah
I got a few lvl 80 ones now:/
13Because if they are, you might want to get some EV-reducing berries to take off points in certain stats
Anyway gonna go watch tv now
Thanks for help angel
13xD Have fun
Ty bye all
6ok bbl
hey lighting
yo
are you mad at me
I'm sorry
no i'm not mad why would you think that? i'm just multitasking while online
oh
well because you didn't answer me the first time i was worried that you wouldn't talk to mt until i said sorry
It's always confusing beyond belief the first time you hear about EV's
:3
thats normal for me unless there are a lot of people in here
13It's one of those subjects that make you go "wat" at first
ehhh no
13then one day it suddenly makes sense
just wait before you say something i gotta put on some music
13and then you're like "OMG I UNDERSTAND NOW"
13etc
i'm good
Yes, like many other things
nice I'm just resetting the friend codes on several of my wii games

...and he actually stopped
I think he's probably over simplifying things just a little bit
:D
Haha nice
Their existance proves that humans don't solely choose their friendships based on pheremones like bees do
But he completely ignores that point and starts talking about bees again
*facepalm*
Despite the fact that we kept bringing it up over and over
/me floofs Espeon
Exactly!
well at least thee whole calss isnt agreeing with everyting he says
Yeah, but some people were
good.
She said he's right, and friends are needed for survival because we'd commit suicide without them
/me used Confusion on Espeon?
O_o
-___-
lol
/me offers a fish then
somehow if bees didnt live togther I don't think they would commit suicide
it doesnt really correlate
Yeah, exactly
animals don't commit suicide

Lol, filter
I forgot about that thing
but but...the censoredins...
:(
I know... D:
cucesoredbers?
cucumber
Aww
6oh that was yours?
13Lol wut
why can't you say "[censored]" though?
6saw it show up in the club, awaiting approval
6the name looked familiar I wondered if it was you
6of course he has
Yes, I worked all day on it, lol
6he loses his memory each season
in sop[censored]re
because it says ho2mo
=/
I know, just wondering why you cant say it
I guess because people use it as an insult
Oh, I figured out that epic-chat has the exact same filter as spyroforum
XD
the SF filter has the most random words ever and they're all censored here too
do you still go to SF?
Heck no
ok
just wondering...
I had an email from bmah from a long time ago from when he was complaining about the filter
I actually go to darkspyro now. lol
really?
Yeah
I wouldnt stoop that low...
:P
there are some really immature people there, but it's OK for the most part
it's ridiculous
wow
do yuo ever post there?
I post sometimes
whoo
Have you heard about it?
o.o
no
We don't know yet
details on it that you have to be
But someone found some leaked information
just speculation mostly?
And apparently the working title is "Spyro's Kingdom"
And it's supposed to be on just DS and Wii
huh
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_HIWdicVSQ
Spyro's supposed to be a Playstation exclusive
6yeaaaaah-
6not for long
or it was 10 years ago
It hasn't been ETD
XD
:P
13...oh dear |D
That was only because insomniac only developed for playstation, I think
/me sits on Kipi
maybe
but the working title is kind of lame
I agree
I'm very disappointed by darkspyro's poll
remember when we were first hearing about ANB?
the working title was "Spyro: Legend"
XD
Hah, yeah
Is it still the music poll?
yep
I can't believe people voted for DotD over StD
=/
in know right?
I just dowloaded some Spyro songs the other day actually
EPIC
:P
You downloaded them?
where?
o.o
that one kh something or other site
oh khinsider
I could find it if you want
Enjoy it while it lasts
I used to have them from there, but then I deleted them all after I found out they were supposedly illegal
I really find myself enjoying watching it. Even though it’s in Japanese XD
:/
But it's not like they were released anywhere else
=/
somehow I doubt that Stewart Copeland woukld care 11 years later
exactly
Probably not
Can’t wait for the shows to be in English
Now I won't get them because I'm too paranoid about viruses from that site. >.>
it gave you viruses before?
No, but you never know
:P
I have no idea where all those viruses came from
or would that not do anything?
I don't know
but my old laptop won't even power on now. XD
that poor thing
abused
:P
-_-
*waste
it was good for taking to classes though
and I could leave it on all the time
Do you have a laptop yet? You're going to want one for college
not yet
(right)
Well, you're not me
:P
I can only hope
yeah.......\
too many periods..
.....seriously, i think I hear crickets! xD
I'll wait as long as possible before buying myself one
just in case
/me crickets chirp
Well if you don't get one, I'll buy the AC adapter and battery for mine and give you that one for $150
really?
Sure
thanks
No problem
computers lose a lot of their value after they've been used for a while
lol
Anywhere from the price I got my old one for to like, $3000
but those are Apple
the really expensive ones
I know if I get a cheap one, I won't be able to fix all the problems very well
but I'd rather not pay 1000 bucks
There shouldn't really be problems with the cheap ones
they just won't be as fast

12I have a problem with loading that winamp program to mIRC
He's using WIN7- 64
o.o

Doesn't work, being updated
directorty?

you just put the files in the mirc folder
I was taking about DRF
12oh
yeah I don't have it on here
wait
/me read logs
XD
I'm reading them too
if you get /load: no such file 'C:\Program' then you put quotes around the address
o.o;;;
"C:\Program Files (x86)\mirc\...<etc>" WITH quotes
just do /load -rs gtsdll.ini
why would you even give it the path?
that generally goes to %appdata%\mIRC I find
Well, I needed to; since it was in my other HDD XD
it doesn't on 6.21.
not everyone uses 6.21
02Okay, reloaded; and I use 7.1
bye all I g2g

12loaded
