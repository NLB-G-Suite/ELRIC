I didn't like the original ME, so I haven't even played 2 yet, despite having it.
CountDoofus: gt it for free by pirating
not everyone is a pirate, Horst
Count is here?
there's always a first time for everything
... no. *spy cloak*
shouldent the lightsabers destroy the instruments?
I See you!
ME3 will be distributed via origin. that alone is reason enough to tell ea to fuck themselves
Okay...why haven't I seen this before...I love it!
horst while i can agree its shit and a failed attempt to be steam
i can accept to use it for certain games
Hi pony
Same here, 7733
LOL
darth vader
I think I'll wait a while to see if it is worth, buy the game and then pirate it so I do not have to use origin
epic vader
pirating doesnt help PC gaming ekips
If I get ME3, I'll get it for the 360, since that's what I've got 1 and 2 for.
pony_7733 i repeat "buy the game and then pirate it"
well
oh lol
LLLLLLLOOOOOOOLLLLOLOLlolooOLOLOLO LOL!
I don't think EA, I think Bioware. plus I'm getting it for XBox, so I can't pirate it even if I wanted to
that way I support bioware but don't have to use origin
tha chewbacca
i love this vid
ekips
yes you can
you support EA by buying a copy anyway
XD
you can download xbox games too, you know?
since publishers get a deal of the money
this vs shamisen bros
@_@ must obey
lol
That's what ekips is saying, 7733. Buying it supports ea, but the pirating of it allows him to bypass origin.
huh what's that
Maybe derpy has a twin....
THE BUCK!?
I guess its a somewhat validpoint
valid point*
08,01AAARGH
piracy is a crime. I'd rather not risk a criminal record, ever
oh god this song
who is streaming?
i learned my shit with BF3. EA isn't worth my money, so they won't get it anymore
Way to finish off my class
08,01seriously, *fuck* one of my lecturers.
Personally, I'm with you on that, Count.
08,01he insists on calling me "andy"
anyway, I'll just wait if the game is worth the price
BF3 is alright but it wasnt any previous BF game
heyheyhey
08,01and has sent a document for an event i'm helping out with, with my name as "Andy Bell"
has some stuff the old games would benefit from
08,01i *HATE* people calling me Andy
08,01i hate it so much
lol
08,01my name... is *Andrew*
Ok...
08,01it's not hard, stupid fuck face lecturer...
08,01sorry, i'll calm down
that happend to my friend to
dat warning
i'm not complaining about BF3 itself. it's an awesome game. i'm complaining about software that openly told me it could to whatever the fuck it wants and the absolutely STILL not working webbrowser based server lobby
some of my teachers keep calling me Daniel (my brother's name) >.<
08,01it's one of the only things that gets me really riled up
ok...
oh yes
I dont really care what people call me as log as i know its me they mean
08,01ekips: i got that at school, but mainly because i'm a twin

Like studying instead of goofing around
No kidding Snuffsis.. I have alot of shit I regret.

But sweet Dashie_Dashie, wish it was that good for me... I'm re taking the year so I should really pay more attention
This song got me f**king pumped back in the Halo 2 days when I used to play in tournaments.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FtzaDxHgLk
can't listen to any songs now, I'm caught in the Heroes VI soundtrack >.<
I don't know why but 70% of the bands I listen too come from the UK.
their always pure awesomeness.
Coldplay?
nein.
pah.
Pink Floyd?
aye
Haven't heard that one Dashie.
Good
Pink Floyd is one awesome band
Is hawkwind British I can't remember?
I listened to these all the time back in the day, when they were actually good. :D
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVTXPUF4Oz4
and when exactly did LP go bad?
When they lost their sound, and make it more "mainstream"
darn flash game.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV5-B-368vU&
"Mainstream" Hipster much?
that concert is boos
Minutes to Midnight is where it started going downwards for them.
heh, MtM is my favorite album
guess I'm a mainstream beeyetch then
Jim: yes, very. I'm to hipster for Mainstream. :P
ahhh comfort :p
I rather hate Google chrome sometimes
I don't really like the sound they adopted for Minutes to Midnight, nothing special about it.
random derps.
why Dashie_Dashie ?
ohh
Kwaklad, help!
so... Iridescent = junk?
Snuffsis: did they use the 4 chords?
alright Snuffsis pm then
Im in school right now
No idea what iridescent actually means. :P
Snuffsis: it means it glows
Teacher cant see me
Well, yea i know that ingwaz, but we're talking music. :P
Showing luminous colors that seem to change when seen from different angles.
oh....uhh...iridescent doesnt really apply to music..i dont think
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLYiIBCN9ec&ob=av2e
Oh, that one.
Alright, time to watch MLP
Dashie_Dashie: its always time to watch mlp
No, i don't like that CountDoofus. xD
/me opens up torrent files
/me trollface
I did enjoy the first Transformer song. But that one is just extremely cheesy, and NOT linkin park
To me that is
well... I do, a lot, but who am I to judge you, right?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysSxxIqKNN0 this one is pretty good.
:P
and then she looked around and was like WOO WOO WOO WOO WOO WOOO
So it has come to this.
/me falls over
I wub you pinkie :3
Oh yeah, New Divide is awesome
when LP played this song when I saw them live, I lost it
But usually i don't really judge bands for their overall performance, i judge songs seperately.
hmm..
swarm of the century or winter wrap up
tough choice.
It's stupid to say that an artist is bad and never listen to that artist, when he/they can have perfectly good songs.
Why not Lesson Zero?
Don't have season 2 yet
What a shame.

we talk about being violated by molestia.
We talk about MY shed, slight nicer than Fluttershys
and possibly trixie..
yes... definately trixie
Violating Celestia is what I'll do for my birthday.
My shed is very shabby

Trixie uses want/need spell on you
>ohshit.jpeg
I don't resist.
I switched bodies with Mayor Mare
what is that kammerjunk
Snuffsis: Your fate.
ok who here besides me.. surfs 4chan /mlp/
OH NO
Started a gang with Princess Luna. And no, you can't join.
I get the pedo one...
KKK WAZZUP
Switched Body with: Apple bloom. :(
*KK
The problem is that my brother is born the 30th of June.
AKA, created battle clones of Gilda.
Be afraid, be very afraid
Sorry, did I say brother?
I meant cousin.
started a gang with Soarin
Flutterstalker is best 4chan fanfic.
just had to throw that out there.
wat
/mlp/ fanfic
also Taurus, Kwak? good man
I repeat my last message.
wat
Indeed CountDoofus
Why is living toombstone so awesome?
flutterstalker.
wut about her?
Snuffsis cus why shouldnt he be?
Because I've lost control of my life.
Kwaklad: He's distracting me
Kammerjunk is curious yes?
Oh hi, emangamer.
Dashie_Dashie: ...Does it mean I can read more stuff?
hey Kammerjunk
haha Snuffsis does the same to me :p
sup guys
Depends.
hey hey emangamer
/me is at school'
^_^
Well, is it a fic?
whats your take on Fluttershy basically being depicited as Molestia.
emangamer: then PAY ATTENTION!
Dashie_Dashie: TIS A LIE!
but with fluttershys sillyness.
otakon: bleh...
shyness.
goofyness
ect
TIS
A
LIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
inb4 I link it to the chat.
well
I have a screen cap of it.
xD
is it SFW?
he, I was expecting: TIS
A
SPARTAAA!!
YFW I'd put it at the back of my to-read list.
lemme read over it, anons on 4chan /mlp/ tend to take the "Actual" fanfic out of boundries.
Because that list is so long, anyway.
the original poster did it very well
CountDoofus i do hope you dont believe in astrology though :p
lemme just skim it really quick otakon.
eh... I read my horoscope from time to time, but don't really pay much attention to it
That's your horoscope for today.
more than i do :
p
oh really? what sign?
:$
It's fun being born as cancer, actually.
birthdays during summer sounds pretty cool
Well, I suppose there's that.
But it makes being called cancer more fun.
Being born with cancer is hardly fun
otakon, some parts are a littl NSFW other than that it's some what of a funny read.
Alright, fine.
Being born under cancer.
Kammerjunk: you are a cancer of the internet!
according to some people
anyone who wants flutterstalker semi-fanfic PM me
That must have been a big cancer tumour, to be born under it
I have a friend who was born cancer. Kinda ironic because of the way she died.
Snuffsis: oh u
:D
Eaten by a giant crab
Jim that is just...............
So, Snuffsis, have you ever had a 'what the WTF' moment?
O___o
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkmFgQ9fM94 /me will continue to read MLD while this music plays.
Quite a few actually
Why you ask?
...
goddammit
'tis a joke
who's reading MLD:
I feel bad for them
Not right now.
just saw that Flutterstalker tumblr... mfw dafuq
emangamer: Tovler is
Tovler: you poor bastard
The fanfic is now 20% more kosher
I've read MLD... didn't do anything for me
Anyone want to see how it " kinda" looks like where i live?! :D
Why the hay not.
sure why not Snuf
Why not
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0iCR4scRxE This was the first day though, lots more right now
xD
/me hugs Tovler and hands him a kleanex
you'll need it
So very boring
Dat Ã¶.
kinda dark :p
it gets lighter further in. :P
I hate snÃ¶.
It's too cold.
SnÃ¶ is awesome
That day it was around -20
I cried when reading MLP after the first like 2 pages...IDK why but I felt so bad for the main character
-20 C or F?
however, 2 days ago it was -32.
celsius ofcourse
Good Goddesse.
SnÃ¶ is good if you dont get it much or if you like/love winter sports
Goddesses*
silly Snuffsis all the cool people use kelvin
emangamer: Kelvin is for silly scientists.
Kelvin is the RIGHT tempature measuring scale
Kwaklad: We have about, where they haven't plowed ofcourse, 2 meters snow
Celcius is good for everyday use.
Fahrenheit is just silly.
i think Snuffsis will be talking C not F Kammerjunk
Yeah.
Kammerjunk: do you want to know the origion of Fahrenheit?
Kelvin is great, yea. But it's mostly used for science
I can tell you a story
For science!
emangamer: Would my answer matter?
Kammerjunk: no
I thought so.
Proceed, then.
Does anyone know of Rankin for temperature
But, if you want i could say it was -241 if you'd like emangamer
No, wait, that's wrong
30 degrees Celsius = 545.67 rankine
that would be +241 only, just 241k
xD
Kammerjunk: Fahrenheit was made so that 100 degres was supposed to be body tempature. I'm assuming it could be used for medical reasons. However when he was making measurements there was an error and thats why 98.6 degrees is body tempature
K damnit!
actually the most persice measurement of temparture is in Joules
What a silly filly who did that.
Wasn't it also used as the boiling point for Mercury or something silly like that?
its 10000 joules outside ^_^
Snuffsis: umm...no
Hmm, ok.
:P
http://img269.imageshack.us/img269/7562/img2455b.jpg Fear my mediocre cleanliness and yet somewhat messiness!
emangamer: i understand that farenheit is based on the boiling and meting points of two totally different chemicals
Thought i heard someone say sometihng about mercury when it comes to temperature
KwakLad: well your wrong
which is what makes it even more stupid (if i remember right)

/me divides Snuffsis by 0. And I also did math.
That isn't math. That is Fringe-science
go away. :(
/me arrests Midnight_Tempest
FREEZE
MATH POLICE
HALT HAMMERZEIT
O.o um... science is just advanced math
No, science is simplified math.
Math is advanced science.
Midnight_Tempest: actually ^
science is math put into words
... holy crap, welovefine added a Princess Luna in nouveau art style
http://www.welovefine.com/product.php?id_product=1801
Also, fringe-science = hokus-pkus like cold fusion.
OMG AWESOME
Maybe buy one sometime
So awesome!
Le plaisir a Ã©tÃ© doublÃ©!
thats cool CountDoofus
Snuffsis: fringe-science?
Yea, Fringe-science, like alchemy and such
basic science is simplfied math... other REAL science is more advanced, like physics... effin physics... >_< screw gravity
if they do Luna, they gotta add a Celestia some day
Snuffsis: well, conparitavely the sun could count as cold fusion
you have to heat hydrogen up to 100 times the sun's tempature to get fusion to begin
The energy isn't extracted from cold though.
energy isnt extraced from anything... :/
No, it's converted
correct
want to learn physics? watch Pinkie pie in every episode of MLP
get your masters degree.
But Cold Fusion hasn't been able to be duplicated, or proven. Which makes it a fringe science.
Like Science fiction
That's how you break physics
but the energy is leaving its original locationg sometimes with out direction so it is arguably acceptable to say that energy is extracted
our* not out*
Kwaklad: One could say extracted when talking with regular people, but scientifically it's wrong.
Snuffsis: cold is a relative term
cold fusion is still a possibility
someone really tried to explain physics in MLP, in class. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muVfidujxRg
emangamer: Ofcourse. that i know.
so the sun IS cold fusion
:P
CountDoofus: yea that video is great
Not to us thought.
though*
dark matter AJ?
Snuffsis: I ment compared to the tempature requred to get hydrogen fusion to start
ah
QUANTUM TUNNELING GO

Also, his expression in that picture is hilarious.
I'm gonna see if i can get toys before the promotion starts.

I can't wait till fall. White Celestia and Vinyl toy? DO WANT
Tovler: How nice of him.

I will not be surprised if the toys take a while to arrive in Denmark.
Tovler I'm now your best friend. Give me money
Tovler, how much you got, lets see who is richest?!
CountDoofus: thx for watching my da, but i watch others, i'm not an artist
I'll be happy to combine a Gilda toy with a magnifying glass and the sun.
I can't wait until March 6th now.
CountDoofus: lol
Now I can get that used Prius I've always wanted.
Right. I'm going to go install ME2. About time I downloaded that game.
naah, it was only 100 dollars.

Eulshy: lol
I meant $50 WORTH of alcohol
Oh.
try 80 bucks for a bottle of Everclear
50 bucks of alcohol to get my day going
I was actually hoping Snuffsis would pick up on it.
do you not understand i can not get any
if i could i would have drank it
Why can't you get any?
im 16
I got quite a lot i can share with you.
and in the us
16 is legal in denmark.
Then Aspirin it is then
You should totally move to Denmark.
i wish
am I the only one that doesn't like alcohol?
yup
possibly
Ethanol by itself is probably not much to like
I don't really drink
Hell, we can't be worse at the economy than you!
But mix it with things and it's awesome
hey guys did i miss much

sounds cool

naw, let's watch another episode of G3.5 ponies >.<
naw let's say we did, and don't
is that the original syndicate?
meow meow meow
moar sea ponies!
Eye : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7ljjOTbLjg just for you
no.....
so, you like syndicate Wrek?
G3.5 ponies has no sea ponies
no sea ponies PLZ
G3.5 (animation) only has earth and nothing else
05loved the original
05havent played the new one yet but ogt it isntalled
RainBowJack: :{
G1 is the one that sumica showed us
05if the new one which i plan on streaming turns out to flop
05i switch to either the calssic one, or art
I just realized something we bronys must do
Eye : what?
I hope it's a decent game atleast, but i don't think it will live up to the old one.
go on Eulshy
We bronys must have Chuck norris as a brony
/me is watching some MLP
and sounds like a good plan Wrek
RainBowJack: Old ponies are horrible D:
05the impression i got is that the artstyle is the same, but other than that its a different game ocmpletly
/me is watching brony kid raps fast
You doing single or multiplayer Wrek?
Eulshy: i think a chuck norris pony has already been drawn loads of times
no
05not drawn
Yea, the setting is the same as well. Tried the multiplayer demo (which was boring) but singleplayer might be fun
05converted
05no demos were released for PC
I mean we have to make chuck norris a brony
05fuckign EA
Yea, i tried it on PS3.
05i bet its because we would know how bad it was
05>:P
/me cant wait on Fighting is magic
:D
/me me too
05if you ask me
But the first syndicate was also a console title so... :P
05FiM will end up a great game, which alot of fun on meetups and between bronies in general
05but
05i cant see it keeping people entertained for extremly long periods
i hope it will have a online battle
I think that's the point of the dlc packages
MLP online?
the pony RPG should be good though
05i still have my original Mac OS 8 syndicate CDrom
They're releasing em in stages
and take a long time to play through
05the MLP Online i can see going far if they pull it off properly
Wait, you talking about Fighting is Magic?
yes
05if being MLP beign the ONLY thing keepign it alive it wont last too long
no i heard it has some things going
I wanna play MLP online :3
It's going to have dungeons i think
me too
And ponykarts
wanto play ponykarts so badly
http://www.mlponline.net/ <- this?
yup
05I also hope MLP Online will have a bit more grimdark approach than the series
aww fluttershy is with a puppy
05not in the way of like
they haven't updated recently though
05UBERGORE
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD1TcUzhb9o&feature=related NO!!!
05but like
05gah
05you know what i mean
they have a combat system
A little gore but not ott mass killing?
has anyone seen the new nostagila critic
What is MLP online going to be?
MMORPG?
05yes
Probably
go to the site and read
i love the way the animation in FiM is done
yea MMORPG
cba. xD
05you can never be assed >:3
I'm looking forward to Fighting is Magic the most
05youre from skellefteÃ¥
05xD
Wrek: I'm from SÃ¶dertÃ¤lje, i just moved here last year. so HAH!
05FUUU
Somehow i doubt they'll manage to pull off something like mlp online
05but seriously no grudge!
/me brohoof's Snuffsis
MLP online it will come
05:3
will the servers handle it? Will the design/balance be alright?
/)
05(\
Fighting is magic is much more likely to succeed though
I take it Silent Ponyville's been canned?
I'm relaly hoping they pull off what they're talking about, trying to make it as smooth and with a high skill cieling so it could be competitive
not seen an update in like forever
I love FiM seeing the videos of it
Well, from the videos and streams they've released so far it looks nice. Every pony has fitting moves/style, the designers care about balance, etc.
Yea
That's what i hope they will keep up all the time. Would be amazing.
I loved when they showed pinkie and she did her jump attack going "WIIIIEE" :D
The "brb" attack :p
Really digging the animation too

T_T im scared of spiders
eye: I saw the URL, and I clicked anyway.
welp, seeing as I'm already drop dead tired, I'm going to try and lucid dream when I go take a nap.
Spiders are awesome.
hopefully ponies will be involved.
eye, go away, thats not daw :(
It is so daw!
Snuffsis: evolution at its finest
I dreamed of a spider last night. woke up in a pool of sweat
Dashie_Dashie: lucid dreaming is lots of fun
You're wrong
Cockroaches = evolution at its finest
got to hug celestia :p
this luna here is pretty cute too http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXUzM4bSSUI
If I saw that shit in my vecinity, it'd get shot with a shotgun.
cockroaches are eww T_T
Ponies = Evolution at it's best.
I hate spiders.
08,01spiders are <3
^
Lies
Spiers are amazing creatures, i agree, but they're hardly cute.
You guys are weird.
how does one learn to lucid dream?
/me is scared.
I sat on a spider once
Wrek might like this, http://youtu.be/cKpK4Wc5TvI
Dark_Horst, first thing is to get a notepad and a pen, and start writing down every dream you can remember once you've had them.
I really hope that within my lifetime the neuroscience will become advanced enough to cure arachnophobia ._.
Dark_Horst: I'd link you to a copypasta picture I have of it, but it's on my harddrive and I'm a lazy git.
Dark_Horst: lots of deep meditation practice, shifting your sleep pattern, and having a tell
After a while you'll be able to be aware that you are dreaming, and thus control your dreams
Spiders are scary but dogs are worse o_o
welp, time to try
Ohhhhh lucid dreams :3
It takes lots of practice, as in months, unless you are really able to do it.
basically, to lucid dream, rem has to be the first cycle
Spiders are adorable, I don't know what you guys are talking about.
I was on the brink of Lucid dreaming the other night, goddamned cat woke me up.
What a party pooper your cat is.
Dashie_Dashie: that's always the worst
eye: actually yes
09,01no but really, can anybody link me to pics of yesterday's shit. I wanna show them to somebody
there are many methods of induction
many rages were given.
What's yesterday's shit?
the cycles being shifted is key though
NewDCD you looked funny being all hyper on cam with the Pirat Rangers and stuff
hmm anyone wanna listen to a nice ost
if you don't start off with rem, you won't be able to remember
Ever had a dream in a dream? where you wake up but your still dreaming
rem?
the actual lucid dreaming does not usually occur during the first rem cycle
Oh, C&CG:ZH. Why you so awesome?
09,01yesterday's shit was
09,01some camwhoring shit I
Coolbluemidnite: my record is going three levels down
Aha.
I decided to try it one day
which one the the shit you are referring to precidels?
*precisely
NewDCD i think it was Tovler that frapsed it, he isn't here though i think
apparently you can go to sleep in your dreams
09,01did to distract you guys while an episode of Gokaiger downloaded
Nice one.
09,01and then, inception
MakerDusk i've only had one because someone threw me out a window in my dream and it woke me up o.O
ah, that
Also, regarding lucid dreaming. the BEST thing you can do while doing it is to fly
The sensation is so awesome
I had lucid dream once.
Let's all get to the limbo and build ponyville there
hmm http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R18kR48oYzE&feature=related
It was trippy.
I panic when i fly in dreams
If I make myself fly, it better damn well be with Rainbow dash
Frapsed?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNAdtkSjSps
Tovler: Wasn't it you that filmed NewDCD?
<3
Snuffsis: I disagree, make a jet out of think air while jumping off a building and control it with your mind
Snuffsis: Nope
MakerDusk: Well, there are lots of things that are awesome, but i personally love just flying in the dreams. i get chills down my spine
i'm just lucky if i can even remember the chaotic bullshit that i dream once in a lue moon
or take on a dragon with an smg on a snowmobile
xD
anyone seen the new nostagila critic yet
nope
show
I have a recurring dream where i see a shadow in a red cape and it runs at me and then i wake up
I didn't mean to make the dragon... but once it was there it was kinda too late >_<
I once dreamt i was fighting with some bullies, so i gave myself super powers. xD
xD
The only lucid dream I recall was that I was in this canyon made of clouds. Suddenly, A WILD FLOOD APPEARS! It takes me with it, and then there was an alligator for some reason. I kicked it and woke up.
Dreaming is Crazy
I've drempt of falcon pawnching so much shit.
It was trippy.
Best dream i ever had was when i was a dinosaur
06Dashie_Dashie <3
rawr :[
ViVi <3
what does that mean? probably that itt's a good thing i quit WoW
then what happened o.o
I once dreamt of being able to take off the skin of my hand like it was a glove D:
Eww...
Asides from that, I really can't remember my dreams.
but still, My cat waking me up on the brink of Lucid dreaming...
really russled my jimmys
Not consciously, at any rate.
Well, tbh it was kinda cool
heh
well here's something
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b44KGOIqzRg
Dashie_Dashie: That whippersnapper, eh?
Why would you dream of just falcon punching stuff dashie? xd
damn whippersnappers.
Dashie_Dashie that's why you keep cats on the other side of the door to your room
dumb fabric.
mfw I left my window open.
You actually do HAVE to say "whippersnappers" as if you were an old man.
cats all HUR DUR IMA JUMP IN HUR
Else, you're doing it wrong.
HAI WUTS GOIN ON IN HUR DASHIE.
wat
cats are wird
weird even
Cats > Dogs.
This is my cat http://i.imgur.com/BCJeg.jpg
i like cats. they're able to care about their own shit

I like your cat, Jim.
thanks Kammerjunk :)
Jim: D'awwwwww
it's real naggy when it comes to food though
Jim: but, no pony.
nice cat Jim
it likes to watch ponies
I have some orange cat. All he does is sleep and and eat.
sleep and eat*
did you call it garfield Kammerjunk
He's not that fat.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHwu-H_KtfU&feature=related
Oh, yeah. He sleeps, eats, and is outside.
and dunno if it's just me, but really, isn't it just the cutest thing ever if you open your door in the morning and your little buddy sits there with a mouse in his mouth that he caught JUST for you?
I promise it's not a spider this time
Dark_Horst: That is kind of cute, yeah.
i d'aaaaw so hard everytime
eye: lol
eye: I laughed.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mNB_VG_shc

but i'm afraid my cat has a beard fetish
that's a nice cat Dashie_Dashie
Cats aren't spoiled though, they just do what they want Dashie. :P
Cats actually think you are their servant, not their master.

I have never played Sim City.
oi?
sim city 5 not as cool as baldurs gate would have been

I remember playing Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance.
That was fun.
Baldurs Gate is kinda meh. Good for it's time, but now not really. :P

You know, I have never played DnD.
Jim: damnit jim, stop being so damn level-headed, logaical and reasonable!
My friends just never cared to play it with me.
i'd probably give it a try if i'd know any DnDers
Jim: if you look at it as if a designer would, it has many flaws in its gameplay
i'm curious

hey, shizuka, wanna stream something?
by today's standards, i mean
I remember when Spore looked to be awesome, but then it wasnÃ¤t
So much cool octavia music RoseyPony :)
heh :)
Snuffsis: Eeyup.
I think I would have played Spore more if it was multiplayer.
OH YEA Octacia drum n bass! :D
Not necessarrily MMO, just multi-player.
It was kind of multiplayer, you shared creations... :P
Yeah, true
Asides from that, though.
I liked the space age of Spore
Then they made Dark Spore, which i laughed at
so what have you guys voted for this week
managed to get to the centre of the universe once too
i played spore
Snuffsis: Yeah, that was pretty weird.
two days later i wondered why the fuck i did
Jim: What you get there is pretty neat, I suppose.
I was hoping for something better, though.
Dark Spore was decent, but lots of things ruined it. Boosting being impossible was one thing. :P
I don't mean Dark Spore, either. I just want to play Spore with a friend.
Also, I never managed to find Earth in Spore.
I did!
ive never seen dark spore
I found earth, but it was lame
It was on a solar system named Sol
You can't even see Denmark, the way I understand it.
Though I suppose that's fair enough.

Snuffis: Eeyyyup.
What's being streamed is kinda random, because it's basicly what the streamer feel like at the moment
Big mac :O

MURDEREEED
Zzrtsh
Why did the games industry fall out with health bars?
I am just a jester jiving jokes
if have a riddle for you slowpokes
Go for it
a health bar slept with the games industry's girlfriend
YoU ZZZZZTT had ZZTTTT toZZZT the buttonZZT?
Back
if you can befuddle this fool, it will be a punishment most cruel
took yerr time
I hatch from a roosters egg,attack me with sword and mage.But if you look into my eyes, you will meat a stone demise.what am I?
Cockatrice
basalsik
Basilisk
cockatrice
Is this a game of hide and seek with 20% more guns?
cockawhat cockaduce cockatrice! The answer is the third
OH WHAT FUN
I ZZZT was ZZZT right
shoot everything
Dont you love games
The animus?
kill them. kill them all
But whooves, both basilisk and cockatrice is the correct answer!
CAn ZZZZTT someone ZZZZT fix the copyZZZT machine so ZZZt I can be fixed...??? ZZZZ
Snuffsis: basilisk is a lizard and does not hatch from the egg of fowl
/me sends BrokenPinkiePieCopy to service
true
but they are hatched from eggs
when did this become assassins creed
STONE demise
How romantic
batman now
LOL
basalisk kills with a single glance
batman seems to be in a coat
bless you
a cockatrice turns you into stone
Aaah
and swallowed a gravel beach
WHo will accept my challenge of wit
hes gonna kiss you wrek
But wouldn't being turned into stone actually kill you though?
so does a basilisk
I swear
/me comes back fixed
Actually Kwaklad: The book says that the basilisk was first created by Herpo the Foul, a wizard who hatched a chicken egg beneath a toad
that guy looks like Sheperd
but as stated the basalisk's gaze kills but no stone
Dr. Drew
yea
sharklion: no basilik only kills or petrifies not converts to stone
I'm back but I might have some errors
Snuffsis: okay
And the fact I have a red cyborg eye
dammit mythology! y u no simple!
Very small difference there, but i stand corrected. You have outsmarted me dr-whooves
PinkiePieCopy 9000?
But, can you outsmart bullet?
i think not
Snuffsis: a basilisk is also a real creature and is quite small and poses nearly no threat to a human
KwakLad, but the mythological basilisk. xD
A bullet has not a brain. i can outsmart metal i cannot out runone
Yeah, it acts as a scouter. And now I use windows, so I might craaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
turn into mare do well -presses button-
BING.

CCCP: Hip hip HURRAH for the USSR!
6.At night they come without being fetched. By day they are lost without being stolen. What are they?
and Wrek is playing syndicate.

Kammerjunk: YAY!!!!
At night they come without being fetched. By day they are lost without being stolen. What are they?
we are sending our men to outta space
Coolbluemidnitee: ponies
I love that video
Coolbluemidnitee: With free will?
CCCP then you obviously dont agree with communism fully
Teenagers! They're teenagers!
IDK i just read the thing
sleep
and no cccp ponies dont get lost
Furbies
nope
sleep is lost
nope
KwakLad: it has its flaws (just like any other form of government)
its in the sky
the moooon
nope
stars!
CCCP if you believed in the reality of what communism SHOULD be then you should not like defining seperate nations as all should belong to everyone
The Stars
KwakLad: Knowing humans, communism would never work anyway, no matter how good it is.
Sharklion got it 1st
:)
yay!
do I get a prize?
DED
We've seen this before.
KwakLad: i guess u are right
communism works in equestria
^
Kammerjunk: hence my putting 'SHOULD' not 'should' or 'is' or whatever else would fit grmatically but essentially be wrong
Equestria isn't populated by humans.
There was a green house. Inside the green house there was a white house. Inside the white house there was a red house. Inside the red house there were lots of babies. What is it?
or is it......
Equestria is the only place where communism works, cause' you know.
everyone happy.
Coolbluemidnitee: 4chan
sharklion: not really because they trade using coin and they have a ruling monarch
Lmao no
CCCP: :D

A man was found dead in his study. He was slumped over his desk and a gun was in his hand. There was a cassette recorder on his desk. When the police entered the room and pressed the play button on the tape recorder they heard: "I can't go on. I have nothing to live for." Then there was the sound of a gunshot. How did the detective immediately know that the man had been murdered and it wasn't a suicide?
Vell hello thar.

The bellhop sees this as an opportunity to make $2 as he reasons that the three friends would have a tough time dividing $5 evenly among them; so he decides to tell them that the clerk made a mistake of only $3, giving a dollar back to each of the friends. He pockets the leftover $2 and goes home for the day! Is the cutoff part

You are walkin down a path that turns into a fork in the road. One path leads to heaven and one path leads to hell. You don't know which is which. Both paths are guarded by an angel. One angel always lies. The other angel always tells the truth. However, you don't know which angel is which either. If you can only ask one question to one angel, what question can you ask to figure out which path leads to heaven?
Answer my question

something like "which path would your brother say is the path to heaven?"

RainbowcrashNBurn: Yes, "If I was to ask the other angel what path leads me to heaven, what would he say?" By doing this it doesn't matter which angel is which because you will always get the same answer (the lie). The angel of truth will tell you what the liar would say (the lie) and the angel of lies would lie about what the truth teller would say (the lie). So you just an angel and then take the opposite path of what th

yep next episode is a fluttershy heavy episode
www.@Tom.comrobogerbil and CCCP will like this site
It seems this was the only Fluttershy episode this season.

Hi Jim!
You have no weapons Wrek, you have to shoot his missles back at him
What most consider to be weeds are native plants that grow naturally, but dont look good in the modern standard of a "nice lawn"
hehe
I went to El Zorro! The Musical! Twas weird having my theatre teacher be in it. She was a gypsy and a t one point, "Seduced" another character. Perspective of my teacher=Blown
What i consider to be weed is a nice green blunt that can be burnt and inhaled for recreative purposes. :D
or not
:D
vinyl, pick up
Oh Wrek don't worry ^^ I just know this part from a rooster teeth video c;
I let them grow in abundance in the back yard, they look pretty when theyre all in bloom
This is like Ganon tennis
yellows, blues, purples, lots of green, and they attract a beautiful array of insects
except with breach instead of sword

Is that your cutie mark?

no
it's not
at least not yet
need to try first, see how it goes,
super mario was made in 1885
i think....
no
1985
Wasn't that nintendo?
Nintendo was made back in the 1800s
1885.
lol
They made cardgames
first game featureing mario was donkey know
his original name was jumpman
Jumpman!
in the donkey kong game
Because he could jump
http://derpy.me/tijTk
get it?
He is a man. Who can jump.
Then Yu-Gi-Oh tried to one up them by making CARD GAMES ON MOTORCYCLES
He is our only hope.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Please? I want that demoaxe
Snuffsis: that is true
PinkiePieCopy: xD
No one can beat nintendo when it comes to handhelds/cardgames. :P
eh, Pokemon TCG sucks
PinkiePieCopy: there you go ~
lol, sony
It sells like butter in sunshine though
Snuffsis: weren't they a playing card company or toy company?
Yea, they were
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Now I can make the Headless Horsemans Axe Thing
because kids, and that game is only good when you're a kid
/me laments on how yugioh was ruined
PinkiePieCopy: Awesome ~
Whaaa?
ounded on September 23, 1889[2] by Fusajiro Yamauchi, it produced handmade hanafuda cards.[6]
Wow....toootally lost power for a bit :D
Synchro Summons
Yu-Gi-Oh!
Punk ass.
Yugioh is nothing but swarm/synchro
Anti Synchro Summons
duels end in 3 turns
So, as i was going to ask awhile ago, what game is this? :P
Syndicate
Apparently.
Old Yugioh went through the entire deck
:o
Wrek Wreks: Syndicate
syndcate, for like the 100th time xD
this is not desu ex?
Though it could be Deus Ex.
by shigeru miyamoto
I don't really know.
new is just "I can summon 3 monsters this turn"
00,03Meanwhile: i never asked for that...
No no, if anything deus ex could be syndicate, syndicate came first
!
Scoot-Scootaloo: Too bad, you're gettting it.
yaay~ i started a combersation
yes yes you did
00,03Darth Vader: NOOOOOOO

She's amazing
SuperBrony64: you are all pale
I like this type of music
^same
SuperBrony64: They changed her voice, her name, and made her eyes straight
Only on iTunes though right?
edenfalls
Violins are so beautiful
You should check out Lindsey stirling aka Lindseystomp on youtube
SuperBrony64: No
Jim never likes violins at home...
She is the one playing the music atm
lol
Tictac - they didn't change her name, but they removed the reference to it
Lol! :D
OU :D
Really? What article did you read about it?
Tictac - where else did they change it?

mlp coming on ch 65 in a couple minutes BEWARE !!!!
the legal department would've caught anything to be sued over before that episode went out in the first place
hello everypony
heck, there's lawsuits going on right now to overturn the FCC's obscenity filters for tv anyways
i.e. the 2004 Super Bowl incident
A spokeswoman for Hasbro came out and said:
"Some viewers felt that aspects of the episode 'The Last Roundup' did not stay true to the core message of friendship which is the heart and soul of the series. Hasbro Studios decided to make slight audio alterations to this single episode."
...scratch that, not the 2004 super bowl

who's drawing?
but things like profanity would be legit

I dunno, defamation, I guess.
Basically saying "She wasn't normal and fitting in, so we changed her"

defamation implies that you ruined the reputation of an actual person or company maliciously

how can they call derpy a mock to retard when they keep spongebob and patrick and many other stupid characters from different shows derpy only said 5 words compared to them and shes censored
Well, some people are stupid.
because those shoes are popular
Tragic fact of life.
in general, you can get away with less in live-action TV than you can in animated shows, even more so in the case of fantasy settings
*shows

*know how big
big enough to protect its uder
buckler, body, kite?
Depends on the model.
*user
Meanwhile: Eh I was afraid at first. Then I watched relieve videos and I started laughing.
RaveBrony: depends of the type
Hmmm....
That brings many more questions...
sound dead
/me walks at a steady pace to google
A buckler is small and round like a large dinner plate, smallest sheild
a kite is the largest usually bigger than the person having to be carried on back and placed in front
Ah, a kite then! :)
you sure?
what are you making it out of?
Im drawing it for my oc :P
oh
Ohai.
Wrek drawing I presume?
kite sheilds are heavy, usualy to protect against thrown spears
RaveBrony: can u send link when ur done?
yep ~
Not as good as the masterpiece being streamed, but meh.... i at least want to try :P
Jaketehsnake: You presume right
http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=GB&hl=en-GB&v=zVNTdWbVBgc
I presume correctly
CCCP, maybe, depends on ho it looks, its kinda weird drawing a stallion standing up :\
*how
alexmm REPOST

I saw that lion on Cracked.
RaveBrony: thats okay :)
Cracked is best website
WRONG.
oh
I like gizmodo as well
Bronystate is best website.
dat pandering
My question earlier in the week was answered that i should use plate armor instead of chain
^.^
But yes Bronystate beats them all
RaveBrony Kite sheilds are usually used by armies so that they may hold them above their heads to protect from incoming arrows

/me begins attempting to insert video suggestions directly into Wrek's head
Yeah, I know. I've sort of got that obsessive personality that let's worry get the better of me when I hear about something upsetting, and I recently read an article about one of Hasbro's toy manufacturers.
I'll be the pony to ask you, "Who's our favorite pony?" randomly and without warning
05this next one shouldnt be too hard
CupcakeWarrior: Entertaining us in the most epic way possible in IRL
NullRadix: you'd think so, but nope. I can be energetic and lively whether I've been up all day with little sleep, or early in the morning.

RAWRity: yea? thats bitttersweet I guess
05i wonder if you will get this one
who was everyponies favorite super mario villain?
Luigi
mine was princess shroob
....Aaaaargh~
/me lives in CT and hates the winters here
RAWRity: luigi?
Weeeegeeeee.
tough decision
Beause Luigi is secretly Bowser in disguise
So familiar...OISJF
Sounds familiar
RAWRity: do you mean Mr. L?
at school today i acidentally said everypony when reffering to everybody multipul times.
nice
mario_pony: Mine is Fawful
Kipkat07: I used to live in CT, I was born there. I'd love to change places with you!
you r teh best
mario_pony: no. I mean Luigi.
I think this might be Luigi's Mansion music?
CCCP: How did people react?
AUGH MY EARS
O'Chunks and Dimentio were pretty cool
Luigi is the secret mastermind behind all of the troubles that strike Mario
I cam back to earrape
my favorite mario villian is Huff n Puff
mario_pony: u mean the villian version of Luigi in Super Paper Mario?
either that or chat is corrupting my mind while I'm trying to place it
Pretty much every villian in the RPG spinoffs really
CCCP: yeah
TT_TT I dont knoooow what this iiiis
Bowser will always have a special place in my heart.
I should really turn down volume before entering a new stream with headphones XD. Anyway, anypony up for some FREGGIN VIDEPOGAMES?
Sounds like heavy metal.
/me is moving to Florida liek a bau5
CupcakeWarrior: they didn't seem to notice it that much but they thought it was weird. I dont think any one in my town even knows what a brony is.
its a heavy remix and it is awesome
Jaketehsnake: naw
actually guys, brb need to clean the kitchen
my favorite villian tie between Smithy and the Axem Rangers from super mario R+RPG and Huff n Puff from paper mario
05no one guessed it yet!?
Darn Otakon. Have fun cleaning~
05wow
taco bell
otakon: with help from pinkie pie
It's sooo familiar.
CCCP: I wish
Axem Rangers were good. Smithy... didn't really have much "Villain interaction" with him
05MM3
LadyCanary: it's um..... I know what it is
I KNEW what it was
It is?
lolwut
Which stage?
Smithy was the big boss at the end of Super mario RPG
whats with all the MM's and FF's do you really love the consistency that much?
MM3? I should have gotten that one
Ahh MegaMan3
05bonustrack inbound
I've never played MW3, so I'm unfamiliar with it.
the Princess shroob boss battle was epic!
how are you tonight LadyCanary?
omg yay
kenne: bc, they have the BEST SOUNDTRACKS EVER!
i got bf3, not mw3
Oh yes
Well wanting to speak to a certain somepony, emangamer. And you?

Rainbow dash always dressed in style.
if you think transformers, you're right
funny... I was reading about N64's being used as doorstops earlier...
ive played super mario rpg
......stupid boss cake
paper mario has the highest replay value of all the super mario RPG's
i liked partners in time better
backround voices remind me of castlecrashers =P
VNES.com
Virtual nes
paper mario is good because it KNOWS it's a single player game and can throw balance and risk/reward factors to high hell
transformers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
robots in disguise
freaking badge system...
What song is this?
more than meets the eye
i recently did paper mario with max bp and 20 hp and 10 fp, and i beat it
:D
What game is this from?
NullRadix: in which game bowsers inside story?
"game" he says
has any one seen Chuggaconroy?
I have!
He's so silly :3
CupcakeWarrior: it's from the cartoons!
dat chuggaconroy
i love his lets plays
cupcake, this is the transformers theme
I stopped liking Chuggaconroy after his LPs stopped becoming LPs and became walkthroughs
13http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Why%3F&lk=2
LPs are basically walkthroughs
emangamer: i havn't seen any of his new stuff
i looved dark bowser he looked awesome!
/me bursts into flames
the koopa kids were also cool in super mario bros 3
and now i go to work on chapter 8, i bid you ponies farewell for now, as i assume i should be able to reingauge you later and if not, i bid the goodnight
hi Midnight_Tempest
mario_pony: they had a bigger role in Super Mario World imo
I REALLY like mario and luigi superstar saga
^
damnit... stupid boss hit me, and it didn't have enough hits left for me to get the stars back from bounced red eggs...
CCCP: yeah i know
Pokemon?
Did I just hear Pokemon?
Aww.
YES.
CCCP: but i loved super mario bros 3 more
whoa more mussic? awesome
Oh wells.
emangamer: me too
x-men
mario_pony: both games are tied for me
This guitar makes Canary a happy girl :3
If you like Transformers , you should listen to this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5U8ho40YFo&feature=related the Ballad of Optimus Prime
who are we listening to?
05i loved this show as a kid
band's powerglove
Apparently a pony is a unit of measure
the old 90's x-men was awesome
This is Powerglove?!
NullRadix: what are you playing?
A measure of awesomeness
Yoshi's Island
thanks, gonna look them up
sup bronystate.
I know this song...
oh right, x-men
ohai CuddlyKittens11
Is this Powerglove?! THE WHOLE TIME?!
My bro was a Transformers fan. I think I was too late to get into it
LadyCanary: I love the powerglove, its so bad
hi CuddlyKittens11 what is you favorite super mario villain?
=_=
As in the band, dumdum.
lol
mario_pony: Never really had a fancy for mario actually.
mario_pony: might be able to come up with one if you give me time
/me heartbreaks
And I never read the Xmen/DC/Spiderman comics. Funny that I first learned about them through the tv series
Powerglove as band, awesome... powerglove as controller -_- why...
^
Powerglove ist sexy.
this is awesome... got a craving for the Protomen now
mario_pony: the most any "Mario Game," that I ever played was Mario Tennis (for the GBC), which barely featured Mario at all
05i have a craving for..
05.
And if you really wanted to know - Prof Xavier is my favorite xman
CuddlyKittens11: but but mario.....it was.....it was awesome!
mario_pony: infact, he was sort of the "grand nemisis," in the game
For what Wrek?
05a LNS with my daily vlogs
mario_pony: therefore... Mario is my favorite Mario villian
"We hate your politics, we hate your problems, and we hate the way you smell, 1 2 3!"

05yeah

Yaaaay~
I left hearing this song and I enter hearing it again

RAWRity: WHAT?!
^
DONT REMIND ME RAWRity.

RAWRity: ...
that video makes me happah
CuddlyKittens11: eeyup. Sasha Baron Cohen is playing Freddie Mercury in the Queen movie.
RAWRity: U TROLLIN?
CCCP: I wish.

Baron Cohen can only play assholes. Freddie Mercury was many things, but he was not an asshole. Nor did he ever throw an urn of ashes onto Ryan Seacrest.
i don't CCCP
I don't think I'd want Derpy driving
:P
RAWRity: Yeah, but have you ever seen him sing?

20% more is 1.2 times extra
not 20
And 1.2 times 0 is 0.
Yeah, once simplified
I DIVIDE MY 0
Lags make me mad
it would make my day :)
however, RD does add extra coolness

Moshakra: but at least it's not speaking in fancy
Everypony elses too

RAWRity: too bad clash of the titans had almost nothing to do with canon greek mythology
:)
the stream is offline... there isnt anything wrong with it
I'm buffered
im not :(
?
emangamer: eeyup, but it was FUN!! The original, not the crap remake
play you! play!
is there a stream?
emangamer: "Coming up next week on The Adventures of Captain Obvious...."
stream down now? awww
Nnnope
RAWRity: supposedly the one that just came out is more canon
RAWRity: lol
Good Morning. 2am to be exact,
otakon: yfw a sequel to the remake is coming in a couple months.
emangamer: it's not. at all.
RAWRity: a sequel to what?
I played 2 hours of terraria and 1 hour of Gmod
RAWRity: ohgods WHY!?
Wrath of the Titans
mario_pony: Clash of the Titans remake
Rise and shine, Mr.Freeman.....
otakon: because money.
CCCP: that would be neat
RAWRity: YES!!!
CCCP, then they will know the truth
RAWRity: I don't like it
mario_pony: yes? That thing sucked donkey ass

RAWRity: you suck donkey ass
PinkiePieCopy: true
seems DDO finally got the hint and theyre adding the druid
What's this? A DDO expansion? Are they finally going to add GNOMES?!
CCCP
and I know damn well "Wrath of the Titans" is going to suck just as much redundant ass.
Clash reminded me of Transformers - plenty of action shots, characters just jammed together to make a story
RoboGerbil: huzzah! now if I could only get my gamepad to work with it

05lessen the allcaps
I believe you are reffering to my ROYAL CANTERLOT SINGING VOICE
^
*swuee* :$
Those 2 moments were what I liked. I did like hearing a little FAQ from the VAs. The hug was kind of weird. The episode was weird. Fighting is Magic was a neat promotion they threw in. So was Equestria Online (3d style).
how about some bass canon?
just a sec
flutter_spin: um, we are BRONIES! We are the STANDARD of weird at this point. And I'm damn proud of it.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u0t8ZIlwuQ
Power up the bass canon....
FIRE!!!
were is evrypony?
hiding
*shifty eyes*
/me hides
am i the only one that thinks this basscannon thing is way overrated?
Hiding from dubstep x.x
dubstep rules!!!!!!
moo
<--- Is thinking of space is 20 percent cooler video because of the screen picture
salvation is reserved for those who pass the test,
Dubstep is horribly overrated ear rape.
I guess the 3rd one was when the VA says "Well fluttershy is sweet and kind sounding... AND PINKIES CRAZY" and that is when I flipped in knowing she does both voices
you are ear rape!!
sure, there'S good dubstep, but this one is.... meh
very much so
I was going to link it, but I didn't want to dig for it
flutter_spin: which video?
at bronycon
If you really want me to find it, it might take me a few minutes
oh i saw it already
is the stream still up?
/me tries to make dubstep with mouth

still nobody :/
It sort of reminded me of Blizzardcon actually

Brave looks rather interesting
and the scotts! SO MANY SCOTTS!
I know. I just wanted to point it out.
I like scotts, so that's ok
Oh no. Women are figuring out there is a war against women.

I only found out about this place after the derpy post on youtube
Yeah, I didn't like Fable 3 that much either
heh. Reminds me of Zero Punctuation review of Fable 3
I found out about this place after watching Ballad of a Brony
Does he mention us there?
yes
heh, neat
i found out watching the chat reaction vids
/me flips
Much better
Should have kept the fight style from 1, you could still have dual casting, but a dozens of combinations to flip through
I found bronystate from equestriadaily
found out from bronies reaction to derpy

I really enjoy seeing reactions, since I seem to miss out on a lot of the details in an episode. It also makes it more enjoyable to pretend you are watching with them.
But fanfics I just don't quite get. I haven't read a single one.

I honestly like derpy's new voice. i always imagined it higher than they made it. But the remake of the episode was dubbed SO HORRIBLY
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7448cY8jXYw Why am I just now finding this video? Some parts are funny, others are... well odd

Nopony ever accused me of being mentally stable :P
Wish me luck.
LadyCanary act aloof
00,03LadyCanary: DO It, FILLY!
LadyCanary: good luck
08,01LadyCanary: if you don't, one day you might move away, and have to stay somewhere you hate for 4 years while you do a computer science degree at a crap university
NO! Made me remember - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBny9H8Yd2I
So much ping.
trust me being aloof is the best strategy for friend making and dating
NOOOOOO he's invisible on FB now TT_TT
he he, facebook
LadyCanary: demand that he talk to you!
yo
BronyCon: yo
Eulshy: only works if your friend/love interest isn't also aloof
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
08,01LadyCanary: the worst that can happen is he could epxlode, then you could explode, then everyone explodes again
08,01and that's really unlikekly
fuck off science
Well I exploded twice.
seems legit
KernalCobb it's worked on everyone at my school
08,01LadyCanary: already? busy night for you, tehn
Also, we might do a guitar/singing duet together :3
I can honestly say no one at my school feels no bad will towards me
09,01Canary
LadyCanary: woooooooo!
09,01now that you're here
09,01I can show my rustled jimmies

NewDCD: do it filly!
08,01NewDCD: you could at least take her out to dinner first
XD
Cypresswolf, NOW DO IT AGAIN!
In english, aloof works with people that want to know everything
:P WHASUP BRONIES
Eul is refering to being distant and secluded and letting people come to you
not letting, nearly forcing
00,03... bathroom music?
they can't help but be interested in you because you will not let them know anything about you
CHALLENGE COMPLETED

09,01Okay enough whoran
<3
OH GOD, THE INTRO
IT MAKES NO SENSE
/me feels like self whoran.
Eulshy: once they feel they know you, they will lose interest in you. The only way to keep them interested is to not let them into your life in any way as long as possible. That is not a very healthy way to hold a relationship with anyone.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzX7unM9Lfw&feature=related
swag
DAT TRU
What's up mah bronies?
I just wasted FIFTEEN FRIGGING MINUTES facing some terrible, terrible demon and I come back to people ignoring me!
:|
KernalCobb it's how i've been holding all of mine for the past year, when someone takes a genuine interest then they get let in
Eulshy: that also means that the only way to keep them is to let them into your life, causing them to lose interest, resulting in a breakup
lol
08,01NewDCD: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmf0oEjVigE
herp-a-derp: I have watched all 15 minutes of that wretched G 3.5 video. Just to let you know, It wasn't easy...

IngloriousPony89: Ponies are the best high.

I don't have very good memories of having crushes
CCCP: got all that?
Sry. I avoid the hot topics of tiny applejack, or rarity's outhouse, or twilight eating oranges
winter wrap up is still my favourite song
Zappy: ponies = high? who needs to be sober
mario_pony: yes
I still can't stand my previous crush for that rejection message
good
i've never fallen in love..... someday im going to be rich =)
the amount of money i would pay for it on itunes...... 8 bits

But still awful
Epic [FAIL] Movie
Tear his leg off at his knee
It's the day people celebrate my birthday by dancing around a festive Maypole, and doing other pagan festival-ish things.

Pinkie Pie gets the Mask
tissue?
What happens?
SssssssmOken!
they ruined the mask with the second one
Oh God WoW. So many memories :D
HNNNNNNG
Pinkie Pie doesnt already wear the mask!?!? Oh god o.o
We do not accept the fact there was a "second" one
Ingwaz: my heart exploded
Same reason why we do not accept Mulan had a sequel
^
SHUSH
THAT DIDNT EXIST.
what didn't exist :P
RaveBrony: cud u imagine Pinkie with the mask? oh gawd
Nor the Matrix
Ikr?? :D
just like the super mario bros mov.....ooppps
Actually, the Nostalgia Chick did a top 10 worst Disney Sequels.
Dang it, why do I like Rarity? I didn't like her when I first got into this show
Huh, i never thot of Fluttershy's parents O.o
^
;) Rarity is sexiest poni
^
no
super mario bros the movie
Next to Spitfire and Braeburn
?me shivers
NO TALK OF SEXY and PONY in same sentence!
/me shivers
Why are we saying that ponies are sexy in the first place?
Actually Rainbow Dash is sexiest pony
mario_pony: that was awful
Weve seen Twilight's, Pinkie's and Rarity's parents O.o
IngloriousPony89: I don't know
...but RD is sexiest pony
MahBoi777: ikr
Spike was kiddnapped i guess
I'm not one to classify ponies based on attractiveness
^
^^
^^^
^^^^
I think everyone agrees that Rarity is the most complex pony and the most mysterious. It is why we love her.
RaveBrony: but not AJ's or Flutters......I'm worried.
... Yeah...
RD is definitely not sexiest pony
Twilight Sparkle is Spike's mom
Yeah O.o
DUH
lies
flutter_spin: um maybe. I've certainly come to like her more now
Hello
they need an episode were they meet eachothers parents that would be fun.
the vdieo isnt loading for me
AJ... must not have parents anymore D: Fluttershy.... disappears as a filly and nobody cares?...RD O.o
apparnetly lauren fausts original intentions for AJ's parents is that they were dead i believe
I will still side with the more sexy = not sexy, but I find her very random like Pinkie sometimes.
Cue Fluttershy's parents being a Pro Wrestler and an Announcer, respectively
who you gonna call?
:(
^lol
OH YEAH FLUTTERS YOU NEVER SHOWED ME YOUR LITTLE FREINDS
StinkomanFan: i actually read a fanfic that had fluttershy's mom as some massive pegasus brute that was a royal guardsman
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9We2XsVZfc&feature=endscreen&NR=1
Brb, i need something to eat x_x
WHy video no play for me???
Because there is no stream
Naw. There was an interview somewhere. I think they said that Applejack parents are traveling around the earth to find seeds like Granny Smith
Voiced by Hulk Hogan and that old chick from the Red Carpet thingies
flutter_spin: i've never heard of that interview
/me swoons with joy
StinkomanFan: I saw a comic where Flutters dad was imagined as basically a loud but well meaning stallion version of Rainbow Dash
Obviously Fluttershy's parents are in the SH.....
Have you ever noticed how much no one likes AppleJack?
fuck i hate TSA
I don't think its "official" but there was a discussion
:L
/me likes Applejack...
CupcakeWarrior: I like her
CupcakeWarrior: i like applejack
it's she's the most grounded pony
pinkie pie is best pony, everypony else is second best pony
she's got ............
AppleJack is worst pony for me
horse sense
Yes Cupcake I have. My friend said that AppleJack was her favorite pony, but recently she switched to Rarity
No wonder AJ was the Mare-Do-Well HER PARENTS ARE DEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD
when theres an invicible man sleeping in your bed who you gonna call?
Dang it, Applejack has no emoticon :[
the cops!
Origionally Twilight was best pony, now its RD
Applejack was my favorite, but I'm getting a little bored of her.
Polydunami: yh, she has no love
also
besides, AJ trolled celestia
Gilda is best Pony
Celestia needs more love!
she does
IDK AJ got 3 eps this season
Indeed
/me slaps Krakass
Polydunami: I just noticed that (>_(\
Hello
Ingwaz: That IS pretty badass I suppose
hiya Swordsman
They need a Celestia episode, where She learns something :D
Hello there Swordsman ^__^
eeyup
RaveBrony: now THAT would be good
Dear Me, today I learned...
RaveBrony: then she wouldnt be the God-King
RaveBrony: Who would she write to at the end?
I am pretty new to IRC but I figureed out how to get here on a client so I guess that's pretty good
Celestia is not that bad, she just seems a bit too busy to deal with all of Ponyville's problems
Hey guys, I have an announcement: My friend, who was a devote pony hater, recently joined the herd.
CupcakeWarrior: she would write to Twilight
/me hugs SlurryMoon
IngloriousPony89: hurray! show them in, we have CIDER!
Twilight! you know? i nice Apprentice better than the master episode kind of thing? :D
Okay, that is so ironic it's funny
hiya SlurryMoon
:D
I want to go to #brony but I'm only 16 :(
??
Oh my...
guys, the video wont load for me. is nothing being streamed?
"Dear Twilight Sparkle, today we had a new recruit to the force and he USER WAS BANNED FOR THIS POST
By #brony you mean Bronycon?
Bronycon?
What is that?
#brony is a channel.
^wut?
No I meant the #brony IRC channel
+18 and up babby!
It says 18+
Bronycon is a literal convention for bronies.
yh
it's +18
do NOT go into it
oh gawd...
if you are not prepared for NSFW
Lyra's over there
Oooook, how do i leave a channel then?
why too late
Well now I'm intrigued.
RaveBrony: use /quit
RaveBrony: RUN
or right click the channel
EW Otakon does that mean its a room for the cloppers?
I'm never intrigued by 18+
September: yeah
And I turn 22 on Pinkie Pie day
At least I TOTALLY don't want to go to #stupidsexytwilight (scrunch face)
ohgawdew.
I'm a clopper but I'm still here
No seriously I don't think I'd like it there
Swordsman: no outside chat links please
Ok, good
I have popped in from time to time
Does anypony actually talk in that channel? O.o
they aren't a bad bunch
Otakon- how do I knew what that meant?
Here we go... taken from the FAQ page
inc text
Q: Where are Applejack's parents?To put it bluntly, we just never figured it out. I just liked the feeling of them living with their Granny, but keeping the family dynamic tight and small. To be honest, I would like to simply say that they passed away somehow, but it's just it would have likely been deemed too sad for a kids' show and I don't think it would have ever been approved. There was brief discussion of them being t
So, how about something poni poni poni
Swordsman: bc it's #
good lord, so many freaky channels, lol
Brb, I should probably go read a FAQ of some sort
yh
Swordsman: the rules would be good
also, one rule they STILL HAVEN'T PUT IN THE MAIN PAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Spoilers of ANY KIND=BAN
You know, Sesame Street had an episode about death
No talking about bronystate?
no cupcakes?
whuzzat?
Nope.
actually, i'm pretty sure thats in the rules otakon
LadyCanary!
/me hugs LadyCanary
Yes....
that place was weird
Ingwaz: nope I have checked
Youre so right, otakon
there is NO mention of Spoilers=Ban
And we've actually seen a funeral in the show itself
StinkomanFan, so Ash's dad was like Cartman's?
lol
For three seconds, yes
In theory yes
Krakass: you mean his mom?
and do not spoil the movie for others
Yup
taken from the rule page
The funeral is there, it is NOT explicitly called out
Before i go to bed. I lost the game.
who was it that got banned for spoilers? I forgot.
well goodnight everypony it was fun!
Ingwaz: no, it means ANY kind of spoiler
:( video still isnt playing, IM depressed and want Ponies
Just like AJ's parents aren't there, but the fact isn't explicitly called out
Night Mario.
MahBoi777: I remember when it happened
i'm aware otakon
gnight mario_pony
Right, but it's still there
later mario_pony
night mario_pony sleep well
night mario_pony
Maybe AJ is AJ's parents...
Shizuka: you still there dear?
Paradox?
opera
Ash's Dad should be the Pokemon Champion in the Black and White 2.
13eeeeeeeyup
Sweetie Belle interupts a funeral to point out the minister I'm fairly sure IT'S AN EFFING FUNERAL
turret opera
It would be like a soap opera
There is a coffin there
Shizuka: just wondering, sorry to bother you, go back to being an awesome ninja of lurkiness
where??
It is kinda odd that there was a funeral there during a happy song
"We have ways of knowing if you are Ban evading" - Bronystate confirmed for secret intelligence agency
Lost the game lost the game lost the game lost the game lost the game lost the game lost the game lost the game lost the game lost the game lost the game lost the game
MahBoi777: far right of the shot
but it's not explicitly called out, it's just there, and it's not like it's a Grim Reaper or a murder
Damn it!
/me rolls around on the ground aimlessly
What would happen if The Game itself loses the game?
Eulshy: Why? Just... why?
hiya Midnight_Tempest how you feeling today?
play the Benny Hill theme at a funeral and let the chaos unfold
also, I don't play The Game
I play That Game
and I never lose That Game
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rToK2i9hGNI
We should play Calvin Ball
IngloriousPony89 spreading the love
That Game is The Game's less fun cousin
CupcakeWarrior: That be like dividing by zero. Dont even think about it. To dangerous
Well im going to head to bed everypony! As always, take care and have fun!! Cya tomorrow :)

I am convinced that Midnight_Tempest is a fire demon
I don't fear Molestia at night
/me waves bye to everypony :$
RoflBot: or do, if your into that sort of thing.....
/me grabs Midnight_Tempest and throws him under the soda machine, pushing ALL the buttons
bye~
Why are the definitions of "A" and "B" movies in the rules? Were they a source of constant arguing cloging up the channels?
/me waves back
I fear her in the dat
I remembered something! I was going to watch the latest episode of Alcatraz
CupcakeWarriot, who you calling a demon?
CupcakeWarrior: Flame Atronach... lol skyrim
Swordsman: it's kind of a flexible thing
Dang typo

ME3?
night everyone
The problem I have with the ME3 MP is that it's going to all reset when you get the real game.
gnight emangamer
Still a week till the Silent Hill HD Collection
emangamer: night :)
http://i.imgur.com/afxiG.png
2 DAYS!

Silent Hill HD Collection > ME3
I thought it was released in May Inglourias
Me3?
Silent Hill probably be too scary for me
Mass Effect 3
/me has felt really left out these past few days
Oh, Mass Effect 3, am i right?
They came out with a demo
I just guessed that after asking
So the new broadcast time for Friendship is Magic is what again?
1pm est
Dead Island looks cool
Right
Yup Swordsman
There are a ton of reasons why people HATE talking about Mass Effect 3, but its good enough on its own
Sweet thats 10 am for me
COLNOL SHEPARD'S WACKY SPACE ADVENTURES
Indeed
I'm currently working on a method for determining the area of irregular shapes
I wonder how good Dead Island is
Calculus?
RainbowJack: Yeah but it's nowhere as good as it could of been
Swordsman: its call a tub of water
Geometry Wars?
fluttershy being a tree = fanon or canon?
canon
Both@
fanon
I don't know. I might either be independently re-inventing calculus, or inventing an alternative to it
Fluttershy would LIKE to be a tree
fluttershy said she wanted to be a tree; anything where she IS a tree is fanon (FO:E and Past Sins are two examples)
emangamer- that's for volume, Professor
I miss the Smash fandom, writing and reading about the Smash Mansion was so much fun
flutter_spin: well that settles it
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iQiAHjXa74 (for reference)
Even got a mention on Wikipedia's artical for Fanon we did
I wonder if it's still there
But enough about my old bros
How are you guys

/me shrugs
Good
I'm still waitin for Indian Stallone to become a meme
If Fluttershy is a tree, then any piece of paper could be made from her
Pretty good StinkomanFan
http://i43.tinypic.com/2pyt1dl.jpg
Can't complain, the situation I got myself stuck in is madness, and I knew it was madness before I did it, but I did it...
MANLY
/me hugs Mahboi777
LOL
ohai RainbowJack
ARe you pushing it to be a meme MahBoi777?
hi
IngloriousPony89: no, just waitin
eveypony happy Derpy hooves day
HUZZAH
MahBoi777: Lazy :P
So why is March first Derpy Hooves day??
Just wondering
Why is it Derpy day again?
I've had Lazyitis for years, don't mock me
No its Ditzy Day now
So do I MahBoy777. No shame
lol
Well? What's the significance?
CupcakeWarrior i like derpy hooves day more
I mean we still have the original footage of Derpy, it's not like we lost every shred of her
my friend like her alot
Shes not a tree Dashie xD http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSLvjfrxynA
Dashie <3
Canon Derpy is still Derpy I do believe
there has to be an episode where FS becomes a tree now, lol
Question - Is it against the rules to shamelessly self-advetise by posting a link to my YouTube channel if I don't spam it?
Or just frowned upon
ppfpft. I started reading a document and at the beginning of the paragraph starts "Huzzah!"
Secretly a brony me thinks
HUZZAH
Fluttershy Lament
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4uDJ6KoBDQ

Soarin lieks pie
Fluttershy grows a pear in the next episode xD

Huzzah is more Cave Story than Princess Luna to me

Cave Story is so awesome
In cave story on dsiware, he says OH YEAH! now

hai guys
Besides I plan on buying Stock in Hasbro so you dips best not screw it up for me
luttershy puts her hoof down in the next episode xD
I feel like a newfriend for having heard about it only after my sister downloaded a Demo for the Wii
im probably gonna be up all night
Cupcake- same for the Wii
Why would you buy Cave Story on Wii and DSI if the game was free in the first place?
At least you HAVE homework to do
Ignorance CupcakeWarrior?
Like Meat Boy, it has more stuff in it
Thursday. Day off for me. Huzzah. Gotta' do taxes though

Competition afoot.
So today, I got a girlfried
named Celeste
WAT
Geuss what i call her
I don't have to
I want to see if anyone out there is just as good at fluttershy as http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfri55l_HfM&feature=channel is with Rarity
Haku, a life-sized Celestia cut-out isn't a GF
...
Not sure if trolling or not
Even if you ride her
Oh, I 'ride' her alright
Has the stream not been working?
no current stream, for like 4 hours?
Nope.
There was none this morning
Good morning!

HAPPY DERPY DAY
Oh my...
Derpy day in an hour and 4 minutes for me
i would love to have a pony plushie to hug
March First is Derp day...why?
mornin BritishBrony!
I made Bacon Muffins that Ima pass out during school

I would like a plushie, but I'm afraid it would look weird for anyone that comes in my room
Hey MahBoi777
/me is falling asleep

I have an RD doll, but I don't like to interact with it much...
BronyState: NOPE
^
SO....
ded
How was ya'lls days?
Especially after that College Humor video
flutter_spin: i just bought 6 MLP shirts, and i'm a 6'4" male, i think that probably looks pretty weird
ded
Same old boring stuff
StinkomanFan: That was actually pretty funy
My friend got me a '20 percent cooler shirt'
O.O we didnt get a little girl at all....
then she returned it
It got... creepy
Kiiiiiiiillllll meeeeee
the fleshlight thing in the video was just wrong
later
Dont temp me CupcakeWarrior
D:
the rest of it, i could have taken in stride, that, that was just not right
Ingwaz, in what video?
CupcakeWarrior Later
not that I have anything against you
*Close up on a scarred Rarity* "Help me..."
That ending was funny
Are they updating the website?
maybe
MelaPonie: college humor's comedy video on bronies
possibly
oh gawd college humor, LOL
So ima try and write this fanfic that may never be posted
Ingwaz, link?
because it may never be finished
"And I'm going to talk to my online girlfreind from Korea."
If only they made pony toys like that in the college humor video
That seems a bit forced
:D
MelaPonie: dont have one

My name is Bluestrom_S and I'm addictate to ponies
Computer says no
flutter_spin i know that feel...
Hi Bluestrom_S
It was just so perfect from the video I saw. I don't have homework, but I know many here do
You too Bluestorm_S? I thought I was the only one!
did you see the eq post by Amy Keating Rogers?
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/02/amy-keating-rogers-response-to-derpy.html#more
Yep
yes
Discords milk explodes? ... WHAT? How could I miss that?
Mmhmm
can I get a summary?
I haven't read it yet
It's not that long Bluestorm_S.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&feature=endscreen&v=yymqbgD_PqU
I felt sorry for Ms. Rogers. I don't blame her for changing it.
tl;dr is for slackers :D
fair enough :P
I have to write an essay about Jim from Huck Finn, due friday and the frigging teacher wasted half the hour giving people suggestions on there OPENING SENTANCES
I'm reading it now
I know your pain StinkomanFan
You're kidding.
You're not kidding
StinkomanFan dude you don't have to write about a freaking chair
a FREAking chair!!!
This chair
How's that coming along TheGreatAndPowerfulT?
lol does anyone remember the iron pony competition between AJ and RD
Don't get me wrong, I like Jim. He's a good guy, but it was either him or a bunch of retards. It's not exactly a difficult choice
Yeah, it was an episode
don't ask ... i have a little close to 2 pages
Well, PART of an episode
i saw a comment on the video: Pony Stark is the best iron pony
Okay, that is funny
The most fun I have is watching the reaction videos, especially of those that are blind - chat logs or voiced
Indeed
I need to know why teachers make things so complicated
I got here because of the Derpy reaction video
When people comment outside of those, it loses its flavor.
You dont konw complicated until you've meet my Spanish teacher StinkomanFan
:O
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK02kxc5zu4
Senior Elroboto
I have an Aviation teacher that still uses an old school projector.. That's about as far from "Complicated" as it gets.
She's swtiched up the requirements and standards for a research project several times so far. And we've only began a couple days ago
That's ok. My computer programming teacher was my worst teacher. His name was Mr. Mellon. We nicknamed him Mellonhead
You can't "Just read" The Great Gatsby. 'GIVE ME A RECAP ON WHAT COLOR SHIRT TOM WAS WEARING WHEN HE CONFRONTED GATSBY IN CHAPTER 8'
Will you stream the Aquabats show to see what the MLP surprise is?
We dont know if that will be this week or not
'Tell me why TJ Eckleburg is important'
'Write an alternate ending to the novel'
StinkomanFan: One does not simply "read" The Great Gatsby.
On and ON
What is the great gatsby?
A novel
I've heard of it
I'm sorry, I got lost after 'tell me'
Lost as in lost interest or confused?
I think the most interesting thing an English teacher did was have a trial over the Scarlet Letter
My english class just got done with Lord of the Flies
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlABSdfuWo&feature=related
It was boring as hell
CupcakeWarrior: I read that book by myself. I actually liked it
ohai
PIGGY DIES
Ohai Hazard
NO WAY!
Hey there Hazard
And dang it, I was gonna read that :[
THERE'S ALSO A PLANE CRASH
charolettes web is hilarious when its abridged XD
A pony with a conch for a cutie mark
Just kidding
I thought Piggy was annoying
Anypony ever read The Divine Comedy?
No, but I've heard of it
i thought Piggy was exciting
Anyone ever read The Crucible?
I couldn't stand Roger
You know what I did? Dig up any movie. If not, dig up any spark notes. If not, dig up any summary online. If not, make it all up.
who here has a fanfic?
StinkomanFan: No but I have to next year
Yup StinkomanFan. Had to for school a few months ago
I've got one
Not bad eh inglourious?
... Piggy? Miss Piggy?
John is one bad Motha-
Lord of the Flies Piggy
oh, Lord of the Flies
speaking of books does anyone have a fanfic?
Not bad. Also watched the movie tied to it. Also not bad for the type of book-to-movie movie
I wrote a fanfic and am writing one now
movieception
/me is reminded of the upcoming Hunger Games movie now
as am i StinkomanFan
whats urs called?!
/me has never read the Hunger Games, nor is interested
now that I've got you right where I want you......
I'd like to buy all of your chocolate
'The Next Conversion'
A sequel to my last fanfic, but only in name :|
You know what got me super upset in school? The one book I would have LOVED to read was never assigned: The Hobbit
TopHat: :O
/me reels in a unmentionable toy on a fishing line "Ohai look at this!"
TopHat: *shits chocolate bricks*
Hey SuperBrony64 you online?
He might be trying to sleep! Shhh!
hey StinkomanFan Would you make me a sandwich?
I hate that I have to read two books at once in order to pass my class
But anywhere from Scarlet Letter, Iliad, Crime & Punishment, Pelican Brief --- I seriously just went online for a summary
No Hazard
XD
NO
BAD DAG
*DOG
flutter_spin: Woah Woah woah, The Illiad? You actually got to read that?
I don't like reading. Yes, it was assigned.
im going to write on my fic...its called Fallout Legacy btw...brb!
Lucky bastard. I'm actually planning to read that book one day.
No I didn't read it.
I wanted to read Tom Sawyer but NOOOOOOO I got the not as good sequel
XD
Never read Tom Sawyer. It wasn't assigned.
Hey Hazard just wanted to thank you for linking me that finfic it was really good
that's wallpaper wrothy right there
I just recall that every year there were 4 main books we had to read. I think the only one that I tried to read was Wuthering Heights
Plus it completely spoiled the ending of the one book I WANTED to read
Hmm Wuthering Heights... that rings a bell...
I like reading in Latin
We got assigned Of Mice and Men at one point
www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqKdH569OwQ
Polydunami: I hated that book
I stopped reading Picture of Dorian Gray after the first chapter
Seriously screw Huck Finn, terrible book
It was an okay book for me
Kind of boring and ended on a bad note
Not my cup of tea at all
Lord of the Flies was never assigned
I like Tom Sawyer
It's a good song
Not reading the Cambridge Latin course? You all make me sad
RoboGerbil http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7ljjOTbLjg
I was able to skip reading Lord of the Flies by moving to another school :p
Cambrige Latin course? What's that? :P
I think Utopia was assigned once? The class objected.
RainbowJAck: YAY!
It's a series of Latin story books disguised as textbooks that teach you Latin as you read
GOAL
hehe
The only book I read that wasn't assigned was, wait for it.....
Land of the Unicorns
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD1TcUzhb9o&feature=related lol
My school only offers Spanish as a foreign language class :(
yeh they got those for all the mane 6 and some others
Forget you,i can eat all these apples http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7YA5F5EWwI&feature=related
I'm homeschooled. i'm taking Spanish in co-op and Latin in my online school
I do not care for today's Family Guy
I do not care for Family Guy at all
nice rainbow. I remember that
Family Guy was at its best when it first started out
I don't have cable so I don't get to see the bad TV nowadays
*Takes Spanish while already taking Latin*...*Three Spanish Lessons Later* "AH DIOS PORQUE"
I never got into the show, but recently the few episodes that I see aren't all that good
www.youtube.com/watch?v=un1_EEuASqs
I also don't get to see HUB, so it's a double edged sword
It is probably why I like MLP. Land of the Unicorns was a good book.
Sometimes biases can be good :P
Though I've heard the book is likened to Narnia
zomg epic http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRTt4rymw2A&feature=related
