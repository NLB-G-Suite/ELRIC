who are just AFK
I'm far too nice for that
also lol
im on android on my desktop via logmein
but SB is a mod and reg on LS so there is only 10 people over there
apparently the year 8/9/10s and others have been telling the year 7s to stay away from me

lmfao Drake

I'm not /that/ scary IRL
does anybody use the livestream chat?
apparently I also walk around glaring at my laptop screen
04You're not actually
with a "I'm going to kill anyone who talks to me" expression
yes
exactly
yus
which is why I don't see why people think I'm scary
04In fact you actually look rather meek
pretty much
04Probably because you're tiny
04Tiny little NS
hah
yet I'm a black belt in taekwondo
Not sure if serious
04Pretty sure she's serious
04but she can't even bowl properly

Don't see how bowling and martial arts are connected, besides perhaps balance

I'm planning to do something about Rhy/Nathan/Leo
04I figured I'd use Monday's emo-ness and turn it into a story
04OH SWEET
I just don't know what
04Make them go to a theme park
essentially it IS a relationship
nah
04Then get into trouble
you did that
I need to think of something else
04Then Rhy and Nathan fall on each other
04and it's awkward
maybe I'll get them to go to a sweet shop
/me runs
Rhy'll get high
04yessssssssssss
dunno
it's autobiographical
must involve a real relationship
has to be a completed story
explores insights into the relationship
displays creative writing skills
04wat
04autobiographical
04why
04By "relationship" does it mean lovey-dovey or any sort of relationship?
well
04If it's the latter, do you and the Hensh
/me RUNS
it doesn't have to be about myself
and
FUCK NO
it's any sort of relationship
04Do May and I then
fuck no
04That would be amusing
I'll just do Rhy/Nathan/Leo
since that's TECHNICALLY real
because they're essentially me, you and Xeli
and we have a relationship of sorts
04sweet
04Just say you used alias' due to sensitive information
yeah
04aliases
04alias'
I was planning to do that
04w/e
autobiographical though
anything that entails?
04We all fucked at some point
hah
04Start at how w first met
04we*
it's 1000-1200 words
which is technically easy for this genre
04Write a lemon
04About us and Xeli
04But in all seriousness do us three
what I'm mostly concerned about is the creative writing thing
...
04Start with how you met Xeli
I'm handing this in to my english teacher
04Then how you met me
I'm sure he wants to read lemons
04And what we we've been through
04XD
it's 1000-1200 words
04Not too hard
I can't write /that/ much in that many words
04Just don't expand upon the details
fuck, you know how much I struggle with short stories
and I need details for this
04And cover "introduced me to 4chan" with "showed me wondrous new sights"
I'm concerned about the "showing not telling" thing though
hell no
04NS
04Help me then
what
04I need to write a creative writing piece
04excess of 600 words
write a drabble
but urgh
04Either about "Going Home," "The Best Summer Ever," or with the opening line "Everywhere they went people seemed to chat with them"
04It needs to be about a journey
/me headdesks
that's easy
write a drabble
how about you write mine and I write yours :D
04Hmm
04Tempting
well
I'm more suited to what you're writing
I can think of a few things with going home
or the last opening line thing
04So
04Autobiographical
04About relationships
041000-1200 words
XD
I'm not sure we should
since technically school rules and misconduct shit
but it'd be fun
04How would they find out?
>internet
04That's why we don't post them on the internet
04:I
hey I knoooooooooow
04But I dunno
I'll write about our bowling experience
04I'm not sure what relationship to write from your perspective
04YES
04DO IT
not sure /how/ to write it though
04And now I have 9 more exercises to do
04by Friday
04fuck me
04at least this stuff is easy
04"Evaluate: -2 + 3"
/me fucks Drake
04GEE I DUNNO
/me cums
lmao
1!
dunno Drake
it needs to have a real plot
so the bowling thing is a bit hard
?
and I have a feeling this should be the sort of thing which has ZOMG WRITING SKILLZ instead of humourish dialogue
ohai Radu
Hi Placebo c:
which is /not/ fun
http://www.livestream.com/superbrony64
Link to the stream.
10,02Thanks for tuning in everypony ^_^
Good morning everyone
10,02Morning Jim
04That was easy.
Bed time, Sb?
10,02FOOD TIME
oh. rite.
It's already 1:40.. your an hour late.
10,02:<
Go eat your tacos. You deserve 'em.
well
10,02You're mah friend :3
/me hugs
my teacher was like
And get your sibling to go to sleep.
04I hate how I can't pull off Purple Prose when I write seriously like I can when I don't even try.
...
Mah Boi
No
Now this chat is active again
/me is going to a funeral tomorrow
Busy day
Sorry to hear that.
I feel like I'm at a pool and adult swim just ended.
Oh, take care Polydunami
I miss the old Adult swim pool commercials :$
wrong face >.>
I miss the old adult swim
I'm gonna go and rest up for the big day
Sealab 2021? lol
Polydunami: Sleep tight. Hope everything goes smoothly.
"the leaves fell forlornly as the wind howled through the branches, and rain poured in torrents, drenching the figure huddled beneath the tree, her legs drawn to her chest in a withdrawn demeanour. tears cascaded down her cheeks, washed away by the heavy rain and sinking into the soft mud like a tremendous weight."
and then he was like
"the girl was sad"
Everything will be fine
04Why are you always so depressing
I'll be back
04XD
mfw my roommate sounds like a motorboat
10,02I'm going to stram some TV shows :3
yay
04That's actually a good contrast
and then he was like "which one's better? the first one is showing and the second is telling but they both have the same meaning"
and well the first one was similar to his but I can't remember what he said so I just made that up
and yeah it is
so basically
04Have a really profligate paragraph, then next paragraph have a single, simple line like that
this is about writing SKILLZ
eh
Why do I always forget my headset at home? ^^
04JUXTAPOSITION
true
but still
I'm going to write this in 3rd person
can't stand 1st person
041st person is alright
04But I hate anything other than past tense
04I can /somewhat/ do present tense
04But not very well
present tense is HARD
but it's really effective if you can pull it off
04MMM
04Goddamn caps
Peace.
It is the very epitome of the world that young Dantius Palpatine lives in. He knows not to take it for granted, for it is a lost concept amongst the beings of the galaxies, but Naboo is one of the planets that treasures it, and keeps it safe in the confines of its knowing mind. His homeworld is a peaceful planet indeed; war has never been seen before, at least not on it.
But of course, Dantius has seen war. He has seen it destroy entire planets, and ravage the once beautiful landscapes that encompassed their very cores. The battle-weary warriors who sought refuge on his planet were always granted refuge and promised safety amongst its beautiful green fields and clear blue skies.
04AAAAAAAAAAH STAR WARS FANFICS AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
04Yes I remember this one
well
04You wrote it
that's old
I barely got halfway through the first chapter
present tense isn't my style
too hard
past tense and present tense are very different
anyway Drake
I think I have an idea
Story: Rhy in the cupboard
moping
10,02Alright, new channel
04...
BRO
04Rhy in the cupboard
04GOOD LORD MY MIND
Suddenly, siblings.
link?
/me watches
10,02Go to http://www.livestream.com/sillyfilly123
Did we break bronystate?
04but hey
04Continue
Basically
Hmm.. My internet is too poor to view the stream it seems. If it's up that is
Rhy is upset and depressed and runs away and hides in a cupboard and mopes
while Nathan and Leonard try to find her
No wait, I just got it
04:O
04Why is Rhy upset
dunno
I'll decide that later
I am apparently writing this in present tense
04LEO CALLED HER FAT
XD
She listens to their footsteps as they echo through the corridor.
The cupboard is full of dust and grime and mould and it makes her sneeze but she is too afraid to and she just doesn't want to be heard or seen. The darkness inside is comforting and a safe haven from the prying eyes and ears of the world outside, but the constant fear of that one comfort taken away from her is oh-so-terrifying.
ohai
er
10,02Ohai
need to fix the last sentence
but that's what I have so far
10,02Go to http://www.livestream.com/sillyfilly123
^
ohai Phase4
04The first sentence needs more commas
probably should have a being in the last sentence
no Drake, I intentionally left no commas to make it have a rushed effect
awww, still on the livestream
04ah
like you read/say it in one breath
to make it sound like she's on the verge of panic
thus all the and's
04nicely done
xD thanks
04I need to put more techniques like that into my writing
04I'm too rigid in my style
haha
The cupboard is full of dust and grime and mould and it makes her almost sneeze but she is too afraid to and she just doesn't want to be heard or seen. The darkness inside is comforting and a safe haven from the prying eyes and ears of the world outside, but the constant fear of that one comfort being taken away from her is oh-so-terrifying. It is quite musty inside.
last sentence
04Show don't tell
04:I
it's just like zomg serious and then suddenly "it's musty"
04But eh
04hah
well
dunno
04And
04As a question
it's already implied that it's old
04How old is Rhy because she sounds really young here
04Just the language used
dunno
probably 7 in this
04H-uh
04Didn't realise they knew each other as kids
this is a severe exaggeration of me snapping in china 2-3 years ago
everyone say SuperBrony64 2:30 c:
04:/
SuperBrony64: 6:30 c:
...
NO D:<
Placebo: You are not my friend.
:(
You are the weakestlink, goodbye
:O
make me!
ohai HeavyMetalDash
XD
hey Jim whats goig o?
'twas silly really
*on?
Sitting at school, not having any classes for a cupple of hours
04You still wanna tell me about it so I don't worry?
sounds neat
lol
damn it's like four in the morning over here :D
It's 6pm
^
11 am
it was nothing Drake
I just got pissed and threw a tantrum
I was pretty much just checking in on everypony but chat seems dead and I'm kinda tired from working all night :P
then locked myself in the bathroom/toilet
http://www.livestream.com/sillyfilly123 << sb's streaming here, i need to reboot. brb
04Using the word "snap" doesn't ooze confidence, but I'll take your word for it.
well goodnight HeavyMetalDash
Going to sleep now then?
lol yeah I'm thinking i'll try despite my avid and relentless insomnia
I kinda wanna play my gee-tar but I'll wake the neighbores if I do...curse my limited options!!!
Haha :D
XD
yay Drake
She shivers with fear as the 'thump-thump' of footsteps draw ever closer. She can feel her heart racing as they are silenced, then there is another 'thump', and then more silence. There is a loud clattering of pots and pans and then a curse and the feet move away and she releases the breath she didn't realise she has been holding.
"Come on, Nathan, Rhy isn't here. She probably ran outside."
She shrinks back as the deep baritone voice cuts through the silence in her mind, and then perks up as the next voice replies. "I know she's here, Leo, I saw her come in. I know Rhy well, she'll be in here somewhere. The question is where."
might change the last sentence in that first paragraph that I posted just then
don't really like it
and I don't really like that paragraph but eh
04change "and" to "as"
04?*
ah
well, as isn't that suited for that sentence
I'll probably rewrite it
and lol Xeli's voice as baritone
well I'm off for a few hours to try and sort things out it was nice talking with you all even if it was a short lived experience :)
I just can't really be bothered to list it as something else
goodnight
good night heavy
04XD
Still
it's amusing
I've worked out a semi-storyline
Rhy is pissed at Leonard and ran and hid somewhere
and then Leo and Nathan go to find her
Leo goes outside to look because he thinks she isn't in the kitchen/cellar/whatever but nathan looks
and then Rhy thinks about it, gets angry, squashes a bug against the wall and thus revealing her position
'it' being the series of events that occurred beforehand
and then Nathan finds her
she tries to hit him
but eventually calms down enough to talk
04'naaaaw
XD
oo
Sleep tight everyone.
hm Drake
04You ARE capable of writing something cute
04Also hi Xeli
what could Leo have said that would have offended Rhy?
hah
I'm capable of a lot of things
doesn't mean I like doing them though
good night plac
/me slaps Drake
04I dunno
need to go in a minute
04Rhy is roughly 7 here so
/me avoids
04D:
/me hugs
She can imagine Nathan nodding and Leonard going outside, and thinks that the latter ought to have tried harder to find her. After all, he had told her that she shouldn't
04Maybe Leo looked at her diary?
oh yeah
that's a good one
and it relays the fact that my mum once looked at something private of mine
so it makes sense in relations to real-world stuff
thanks Drake
04No prob
After all, he had gone into her room and taken her little book of all-her-secrets and then read it and then laughed.
/me removes the laugh bit
After all, he had gone into her room and taken her little book of all-her-secrets and then read it and taken it again.
that's a bit better
as little sense as that makes
04XD
It Worked!
What worked?
She wants the little book back with all its pretty drawings and stickers but Leo won't be giving anything back after he has taken it.
fixing windows from linux
the last part is a bit weird Drake
any suggestions?
damn tense
i ran the recovery image in qemu and set the vm's hard drive to mine
04XD
ooh, neat
Oh no, she knows that Leonard has it and will keep it until she gives him what he wants which she does not know about and would not like to know about.
04"She wants the little book back with all its pretty drawings and stickers but Leo won't be giving anything back after how she acted/after he takes it."
04Not sure
hm
I'll figure it out later
04:/
10,02Now Playing: Futurama
futurama is on here too
But oh, she so wants the little book back!
The fly's remains hit the wall.

Hey everyone
why are there no emoticons of AJ?
Hi jim
im the only one here :\
It can't ALWAYS be a riot of conversation moop.
Lasharus: were u here the whole time?
we're all here
and yet, we're not
yah
oh
It's the way of the ninjas, don't question your sensei moop-san.
Lurking, level 100
MirrorImage: is your name refering to when Pinkie Pie looks into the mirror in episode 3?
episode 3?
of season 1
Ticket Master, I believe, right?
^
i know which episode it is, i just don't remember that scene
(which makes the answer "no," btw)
then why are u called that?
Why are you called moop, then?
because i pulled a name randomly from my brain and this is what came out
i remeber hearing about a band called moop but i've never seen them or heard their music but i like the name :3
Google moop then, perhaps you'll like their music
i'll try that

Hi everypony

>26 pound gummy bear
>$150
HOLY SHIT WHO BUYS THIS STUFF
Ohai Dari
Hey
ohai Dari
I've seen this huuuge gummy worm too
Now I wanna nom gummy stuff :c
Mane 6 rooms - Y U invite only?
Dat Kammerjunk
Hi Kammerjunk
ohai Kammerjunk
hello everypony
ohai dashiee
Oh hi.
Hi dashiee
Avê, dashiee.
broadcast offline :(
Oh lawd, I found that gummy bear. 32000 calories o_O
But seriously. I liked the conversations in #Twilight_Sparkle D: And now it's an invite only room.
invite only room?
Really?!
It says so to me in the console.
Kammerjunk - the pony rooms are being turned off during the week
Yeah, according to the news letter it will be so FOREVER. Except for during the new episodes stream
not enough moderators to cover them all
ForEVEEERRRR
I thought that was why they hired new mods?
Oh, well. The conversations weren't always THAT good, anyway.
Why can't i go into the twilight chat?
Nah, like 4-5 of the old mods were inactive
yes, but they didn't hire enough mods to cover 7 different channels 24/7
I'm stuck in the main chat
When does streaming start again?
Thunderpony - Pony Chats are turned off during the week now
Thunderpony: Apparently, the Mane 6 are invite-only except for new episode streams.
pony_3583 - when one of the streamers finally wakes up
:[ WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT
Radu: Speaking of which, where IS Vi anyway?
there's not enough moderators to cover 7 different channels
so instead, those 6 are being turned off and everyone gets shunted here during the week
eeeeeyup
Meh, the Mane 6 rooms were awkwardly quiet
Why not just have 1 mod for each?
At least the RD room
And when that mod goes to sleep turn the room off
I remember some quite good conversations in the Twilight room at BMN.
Hmm
For example, we ended up talking about the nature of the universe for some reason at that film with John Coffey the Magical Black Man.
Atleast activating them for BMN would be nice
well its twilight room they all need to be wise in there :P
hello bronystate!
Oh hi, otakon.
hi otakon
Hi otakon
hi otakon !
damn
it MUST be slow
hello otakon
hi guys
What must be slow you say?
When I was a child, I had a fever. My hands felt just like two balloons.
Hi everypony
Now I've got that feeling once again. I can't explain, you would not understand this is not how I am.
Avê, TOY_PON3.
Kammerjunk: I love that song
:3
Indeed.
ohai TOY_PON3
Though my favourite in the album is still The Trial.
hiya TOY_PON3
I'm going to school today! :)
um
yay?
I just came back from school.
I don't have school no more
I got home a while ago
I miss it
^
I'm a junior :/
i hate school :(
I'm not sure if what I'm in would be elementary school.
I might be conscripted into the army this autumn
I don't hate it, I just hate homework
Big difference
I have no idea for how long elementary school goes on, nor what high school is about.
Here, we just go to one school for 10 years, and then we're free to choose.
US schooling is just confusing
Trust me I'm from the US
Kammerjunk - elementary school typically consists of up to either 5th or 6th grade (year 5/6), depending on the district
MirrorImage: Ah, thanks.
Jim: Like I said, too complicated.
What the school system in the US wants is for all of us to become Professors but not all of us want that.
IMO that is
I'm going to finish primary school this year, and then I plan to attend HTX.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7HrijDkfHc&feature=player_embedded#!
Which is a lot simpler, in my opinion.
watch that and laugh your ass off
I feel pretty bad sometimes though..because while most students nowadays hate school and such kids in Mexico or some other foreign place would beg to be given school
/me deeply thinks
^
So true
;'(
i hate school but also i will hate it if i stay home the whole year
dashiee: We all have our opinions my friend
when 1) not everyone wants to know everything and 2) not everyone needs to know everything
just finished MLD
:'(
Don't spoil please
MirrorImage: That's so true
i won't
moop: How you holding there buddy?
TON_PON3: i cried alot like alot ore than i expected
moop : aww now go listen to this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=if4RJd7UF30

moop: You'll be okay give it about a day or two
TOY_PON3, I read that in engi's voice
Radu: Not sure if funny
No, really.

Well I need to go now take care everypony :)

im a closet brony
^
ofna01: she's a young girl though, it's not odd for her to like MLP : FiM
understandable
Closet brony?
What is that
basically
noone besides me knows
I don't know if an 11 year old female qualifies as a brony. That's kinda the target demographic isn't it?
My friends know I am a pegasister and I even watch a episode sometimes with one of my friends
did they really censor a dummy?
no one around you know your a brony
Krakass: yh
Oh...
Radu: a brony that hasn't told their family they watch the show
actually I told my younger brother
hay everypony
he's 15 and an idiot atm
My younger brother is 7 months lol
HEY
im 25
but he was surprisingly cool about it
15*
hey VioletGreysha
Ever thinking of coming out of the stable?
ofna01: teenagers are different all over

yes Pegashy?
I'm good, I like it in here
I am really smart for a 11 year old :3

Pegashy: oh no doubt

I like that kid
any brony/pegasister is smart
well....
hmmm seems that way
yeah she's pretty cool ota

Being stoned wears off after a while.
Then you're just hungry.
11,01otakon: Decoy.

anyone wanna play TF2?
TFhats*

11,01Note: Link to my steam games on the list.
So far.
whoa...
TF2 has 3 votes in the lad
um Krakass that might be a bit much
*lead
00,10pushing it a bit there Krakass
we should make a Bronystate group on steam
that's.....strange
I wrote TF2 first c:
ofna01: there is I think
00,10we have one ofna01
ofna01: we have one
11,01I can't even view the image because of a mature filter.
link nao
yh
It has been around for months
Basically a cream pony with aliens coming out the cutie mark
Krakass: if it's something like that, screen it by one of the mods first
Just contains slight gore
that's borderline
11,01Any images with gore is a no-no here.
just blood spatter really
indeed
but rules are rules
Someone removed the options on https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvgUisrDwyh9dGk2V0RJWVIyVlV4RVdVV3NCS0ozaWc#gid=0
and they NEVER stopped using that line
11,01What?
am i missing.....an eyebrow?
"Am I missing.....an eyebrow?"
lol
can I add a suggestion on the list?
it's Adam's catchphrase
I think I heard this one
11,01Freezing the list.
Yes, I heard this myth many a time
yeah XD
hi
BOOM HEADSHOT
:3
ooh mythbusters
11,01No offense, but everyone's screwing with it.
stream will be watched
Sumica: true, but it's not his
Nittany_Discord: sorry, I was trying to vote on the wrong bit at first
ahh this one was alright
^
if there was ever a zombie outbreak
these guys would be set
get a bucket of pennies
and dump it off
Get a bucket of gold
and drop it :)
they have enough firepower and inventions for it
and keep it
ota
ota, your gonna get kicked again
Basically, TF2 got 3 votes
unfoundbug: why?
first place i would be heading is to to adam and hamie
that's ofna01 posting all that
ah, 5 not 6
in 10 seconds
one more message and dari would of cuased rage
are you counting now?
um no
but they're spaced out enough I don't have to worry about it for the moment
I was going to vote for battlefield
hell no
what is there a vote on?
battlefield is boring for livestreams
11,01I'll likely take Battlefield off. I'm not a fan of the game honestly.
/)
Battlefield and CoD - parp
00,10*pat pat* that's great
-_-
Do what you want, Nittany
I support taking Battlefield out of it...

lol
11,01I've rarely had fun in a BF game.
only reason i play BF3 is for vehicles
When you live comment and are very good it can be fun,
11,01Steep difficulty curve.
Nittany_Discord: bad company 2 was fun
11,01I didn't like i.t
but otherwise it sucks
11,01More rage than fun for me.
BF: BC 2 was a GREAT game all over for me
I should get it again
bf3 wasnt very good
but I'm afraid the MP is dead by now
Assassins Creed Brotherhood,now THAT'S a good game
11,01Honestly, Battlefield's MP has not been friendly to me.
never played it
same here nittany
Nittany, replace Battlefield with Super Meat Boy in the list pl0x
no
please NO
nope
NO MORE SMB!
happy wheels
^_^
Meat boy = the game that makes you rage
I tired of speed perfection games!
Happy Wheels is good too!
00,10watching SB fail at it was enough =p
HAPPY WHEELS
Sumica: agreed so MUCH
11,01I rage less over SMB than BF:BC2.
QWOP gives rage
SMB streams are pretty good if a mic lets you hear the rage
Sumica: SB sucks at it. You should so watch me.
Happy wheels - meh
faz
u haz no taste
yaaaaay
I'm a fan of the classics
ya can't beat the classics

Don't they have the replicator things that make food?
limited torpedos

00,10I dont think it works with people
NO NO REPLICATORS!
stargate is on brake
Silver_Rush: LulSG1
Silver_Rush: wrong series
http://youtu.be/yp_l5ntikaU

00,10limited power and supplys to replicat from.
Ahh
squee
awww
huzzah
Can you eat holographic food? :<

holographic food= weight loss program
Also, how awesome would it be to have video games on the holo-deck?
lolol
they don't even have a full surveillance system on a warship?
ahh yea tetris forever
everybody could board them
derpy_pony: that's pretty much how the Enterprise works most of the time.
00,10Holodeck would be the end of mand kind
Eww
>go to holodeck
and yet they rely on eyewitnesses
>make enterprise within holodeck
>go into holodeck enterprise holodeck
really?
00,10they did that one
yo dog i heard you like holodecks
They did? Aww. :<
LOL
13vgeeeeeeer
>go to holodeck
>receive ponies

>????
Good idea.
>profit
13>go to vger holodeck
anyone else hearing an annoying click?
13>play pool with ponies

oh you KNOW if holo-deck existed they would make a pony mod for that in an instant.
Isn't there an episode where stuff in the holodeck becomes real?
well i just got my provisional license
there's a pony for that
but just imagine, racing games in the Holodeck.
00,10voyger did that alot
so whats up everypony?
hey Rain
i know whats going on
alians
I wish they played a random episode of ponies
aliens*
13well you had the doctor way later
So why can't you make Earth, then make the stuff in the holodeck real?
00,10also great idea dari, make equestria in a holodeck
13i can only think of a couple times where holodeck characters got out
awesome idead
not much just got my provisonal licencse
idea*
I'm not saying it was aliens, but it was aliens
he's a sleeper! shoot him!
which mean we've essentially figured out how to create life in the future. Star Trek has killed off God. WOOT!
00,10the stuff that they make real still pulls from the replecator supplys
Yoooow :)
back :3
no
wb Pegashy
but again, with proper energy supplies, WE CAN CREATE LIFE ARTIFICIALLY.
no replecators pleaassee
so, is there a show on? if so who is the host?
how come they never did a doctor who crossover
13ohhh this episode~

"Wait... Klingon?"
This fandom pumps out content faster than I can read, and it's fantastic,
I like how in this nobody cares about the background extras
Teleports are instant.... no time???
Kammerjunk: ikr?
background extras? What am i looking for?
kammer, it can be annoying to try to keep up when deadlines loom
yet in mlp, there's speculation and TONNEs of backstory even for ones that don't have names
it was the red shirt
00,10no time I have to make a death speach
and then she was human FOREVER
Stallion_of_War - the way Teleporters work, in theory it has to superheat your body to several million degrees farenheit...
ever heard of a System Shock check from dungeons and dragons?
unfoundbug: But then afterwards, you have so much to read!
eh, I liked her when she was half breed
I love reading!
ah
not really, i tend to find work gets forgotten as the reading takes over
All this is reminding meof Galaxy Quest
ah the status quo
eeyup
she never gets rid of that part of her
Well, on to the incomplete 19-chapter sequel.
This is going to be a fun evening.
now she'll be that quirky hybrid we all know and love
00,10it's supposed to Galaxy quest is a paridy of Trek
lol i know
Stallion_of_War: no idea
Anti-aging?
Pantene Pro V

8D
then I came and now look ;p

00,10nah these are not the off the wall flavors
Wait, being high and having sex?
These sound like good things

lol
00,10It is Jelly belly. But not the crazy flavors ones
Im still pretty blotto
And you're not sure which it is?
Well, do you like it or not?
Presea WHY
Jelly bean conversation?

Sardines were great.
00,10i havent tryed it yet, I am warry it might be licorice
/me RUN
Placebo: what class was that?
Licorice = blah. Grap = Win
the vomit one was supposed to be pizza flavored, but it messed up and they just decided to name it Vomit
moop: Our science teacher got like, a butt load of them.
So we watched a jelly belly documentary, tasted 'em, etc.
that sounds wrong
good times good times

Vomit really was atrocious.

u want this cake?

TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I'm not that that young sounding
Midnight_Tempest: agreed
PONY :|

this is... not science, this is high school randomness
Ok guys, if this works I call first dibs on the swing and you are gunna make me do a 360
watch it fail
I wonder if South Park did this
emangamer: dat standar wheel positioning in britain

It feels like something they'd do
that poor dummy
Finally!

Kenny lived!
OK now you guys hit me with a car. I wanna do a 360
this was flagged by the government for dummy abuse
thats not beuatiful
yeah, all it took was a dummy and a car
ITS AMAZING

all u need is a friggin car
ok... so now they should do it with a live person
They call it an xbox 360 because when you see it, you do a 360 and walk away

WHY?!
/me misses his fro
i must get rid of my 1000 pennies
well you just need iron oxide and aluminium in the form of a powder. you also need something ti start the reaction. i think magnesium and barium oxide is typically used
Placebo imma go with that
Afro= power, it's a fact
Hazard3: I probably don't really look like a guy, mind you...
Sumica:why? is it coz the loss of money in circulation messes up part of economy?

emangamer- I don't really know how to explain... Up until last year, I absolutely HATED Chucky. Then I realized how much he reminded me of Rainbow Dash. So, dozens upon dozens of listening to "Giggle at the Ghosties" and 10+ pages of notes, I became a Chucky fan on August 28th, 2011.
:O+???=$$$

Nittany_Discord: we'll have to connect via the commant prompt
Half Life 3 will destroy the competition
Well, you'd think you'd think whether or not ;p

11,01Half Life 3 will be the best game ever.

11,01And it'll be from Valve, so I won't feel bad about buying it.

The mane 6 channels are closed outside episodes ehh? That's ok, I exit them and come here anyhow 99.99% of the time
Nittany_Discord: do you want to host or do you want me to?

11,01Whichever works for you.
I heard Gabe Newell ate Half-Life 3 bcause he thot it was a donut
Nittany_Discord: you probably should, PM me your ip address
1,3Valve doesn't make games with 3 in the title
!!
Elder Scrolls VI is gonna have to be Elswer
what about Portal 2 OST part 3?
that would be super cool
I wish I was Dutch... I wanna go to a brony meet-up
