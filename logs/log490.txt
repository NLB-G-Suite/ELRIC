well, I've gotta get up early tomorrow. I'm showing a bunch of my friends my collection of awful anime!
its as if these people don't like shows that are really half-hour long toy commercials. :D
Now we get to see the three Zentradi spies discover the joys of dating.
wait, Rick led?
lady facepalm
First off, Garzey's Wing. Next, Eiken! Then... MASTER OF MARTIAL HEARTS
Rick was the team leader protecting Lisa.

annnd they think sexx is icky
we must get the proto-culture
get the SLDF-1
The officers on the SDF1 are models of professionalism
dramatic pipe
macross/robotech has aways had silly plot...cool mecha though
always
Hang on. Protoculture was explained in these liner notes I got with my fansubs.
lol
Protoculture in Robotech is a biologically-derived energy source.
-_(\
As in the first culture.
lol
Sooooo the same energy that's extracted from the Matrix? I mean di the Wachowiskys still more material?
Someone's read the novels, I see,'
In both it's hardly ever really explained.
*steal
she looks high all the time
to punish them for their evil ways, we shall expose them to the singing of our greatest weapon
*u
Have all the novels. Most are pretty good, I could slap McKinzey-- BOTH OF THEM-- for the Zentraedi Rebellion.
Oh my
ha lol thay angry
Let's hear her ONE SONG!
the power of music
I saw the novels only once. Never could find em again, but whatev
And I'm here now, scared stiff/My name is not Biff
Does she only know that one song?
at this point in the story, yes.
i drew my OC anyone wanna see? http://deathstardances.deviantart.com/#/d52t1oo
Actually, she's got more than one. Unfortunately, they are all sung by Reba West.
I think in Macross she had more different songs.
Robotech was really damn cheap with the music in these early episodes.
Good, cuse this one is. Not. Great.
music is the worst part of robotech/macross
00,10if you want
Oh, but you haven't heard "To Be In Love" yet.
Actually, at the time, it was pretty close to most J-Pop of the era. :P
Brrrr....
Thanks.
:)
does anybody have a copy of macross dyrl?
Okay. Where did that get cut off?
DeathStar...STILLLL SNOOOOW!
why does she like shes from a minstrel show? (noo offense)
