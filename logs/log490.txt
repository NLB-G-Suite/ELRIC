/me is watching Fight Club
http://i.imgur.com/ogYgN.png I added a healthbar and rain!
When I came back, I saw Painttool SAI, but since it was a background being drawn, and not a saucy pony, I wasn't sure if it was Wrek or not. So it wasn't. OKay.
sagas you broke the first 2 rules
need stream
The rain is still not done, the texture is a place holder
alexxm: Damnit...
We are breaking the rules about Masculinity!
what is that, Very_Silly_Filly?
That is a little screenie of a game I'm making
alexxm: Oyus
Actually, I think that Masculinity changes every so often, and bronies are a sign of that change, not the cause, but anyway...
cool
what the fuck alexxm
But yeah, we made PBS :)
Randomnerd: We did? where?
oh yeah we did make pbs, suck it haters
Twilight Sparkle would approve! Fluttershy, not so much, since Nature keeps showing footage of bunnies being eaten.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Est3UNs-LIk
^sagas
i saw that
I did not know that was PBS. Now if it would just make it on tv...
Wow. Reasonably slow morning...
weve taken the internet next, mtv
Comet: Can we not? I feel they would just bash us
:P
Ponies are too good for MTV.
we will concor
They don't have gel in their manes.
A HUGE amount of fan-art... Like HUGE huge
Bronies Unite /)

Pink was masculine til the 1920s TIL....

Kandarihu: i never learned the skill bash
:3
No lets aim higher........let take KONAMI
owlicious: Bash is a terminal program for Linux. Come to think of it, he probably doesn't even need it. He's too leet for desktop environments.
Even though it's quarter to nine in the morning, i'm going to bed bronystate.
Kandarihu: we've seen pictures of his linux desktop. His external is /media/TARDIS.
I really oughta tell my mum I'm a brony soon. >_<
That moment when your realize there are only 10 minutes left of work.
UUUGGGGHHH
and then Nintendo
Oh, okay.
Kandarihu: that was a lame joke, i know. still don't remember what $< $> $$ etc do.
You're better at Linux than I am. I have a crippling addiction to Windows.
And that's not a good thing.
Gnight Scarlet
omg WRECK IT RALPH is amazing
The world will end when Bill gate has no money
Night time
Bye everypony
Bye Very_Silly_Filly
Gnight Very_Silly_Filly
Bill Gates already retired.
im back :)
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
In any case, I hear that Windows 8 has an always-on DRM like Diablo III
Kandarihu: windows 8 sucks
Comet: he retired but he still has money
Kandarihu: Im not buying it. Windows never really cared much about DRM
thank luna
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTnOGaFmUDw&feature=related
what do we do now
alexxm: nothing
wait
Either the final version of Windows 8 is going to be DRM free, or we're going to one day see an update to Windows 7 and XP that will implement that DRM on those computers as well.
Michael: awesome
desktop ponies.......every where
Kandarihu: Windows 8 will likely have the same DRM as other versions of Windows
Hi
hi BroadWay_Pony101!
I'm back.
im front
hey BroadWay_Pony101 hows your day bene
What's going on?
Imagine being REQUIRED to be on the internet just to boot your computer, and imagine what it's going to be like after a natural (or terrorist) disaster ravages the internet.
:S
Kandarihu: no not my porn!
Kandarihu: Im telling you its not going to happen
I'd better hit the hay. It's nearly midnight. Goodnight.
brb
bye GlutenFreeJenkins!
sagas: why do you think that?
Shadowbolt: "Were the best ariel-flight tem in the everfree forest" Me:"Arent ypu the only ariel-flight tem in the everfree forest?"
Kandarihu:cause microsoft isnt that stupid
Kandarihu: They have no reason to. Microsoftis pretty chill about pirated copies of windows
indeed
the only thing thy do is get a black wallpaper
Oh, I thought you said the EMP wouldn't happen. But Microsoft isn't chill about that.
and a this windows copy is not original
and thats all
BUT WE FIND IT AAAL
mmmm dis silence
why are we talking about microsoft?
/me starts new topic
porn!
porn
god damnit
xD
glorious porn
In any case, Microsoft wants to stop the piracy of their OSes at all costs. If Blizzard is effective at stopping the piracy of Diablo III with their DRM, then Always-On DRM is going to be the flavor of the day.
pr0n? where?!
BACK
back
porn
Pony porn
porn, wat?
Kandarihu: you'd have to have worldwide wireless coverage for that to work. It's also difficult to get computers without windows installed by default right now anyway.
uh, i mean, porn
If we get an EMP attack while that DRM scheme is used by Microsoft, then every copy of Windows that uses that DRM will never boot again.
:|
Um, hi....?

BroadWay_Pony101: hi!

THING AINT LOADING
:$
pornographic amazeballs
:[
how about a pornographic broadway play
I messed up something :(
owlicious there are two ways to get computers without Windows by default. One is to build your own computer yourself, or find a small computer shop that does it for a fee and can honor your request to not have Windows.
mmm i like pornographi porn better
10So mentally tired
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWEjvCRPrCo
03made it more upbeat, since the regular one has this stupid slow section after the first verse
Kandarihu: i cant see the word porn over there :|
Kandarihu: laptops?
cachi01: agreed XD
It would have to be a desktop.
/me likes adult humour.

alexxm: Because i find it funny :D
I CANT TAKE IT ANYMORE!
Kandarihu: u mean........ PONIES :O
ponify everything
No power means running water will no longer run either.

07lol
6california adventure is worth the visit imo
So who's streaming?

03I always call the Spaceship Earth ride at Epcot "the giant golfball"
03this comes from when we were in Orlando and I was like 4 years old
03and it looked like a giant golfball
Yep!
03never mind that the thing spikes out instead of inwards, that's petty details :P
Sumica: I here's ya :)

Oh my, this will be a very HARD game.
Nittany_Discord: you missed a good game of ravaging Mars.
What game is this?
03I could just do a 2x4 matrix, but then... why wouldn't she just write it as a 2x4 matrix? There's obviously something else
11,01Kandarihu: I saw that.
Sumica: Are you saying Luna is "wide"? :P
Oh, okay. Well that's what I came back to.
02hurr
Eddmario: Dungeon Defender
03Linear algebra is so confusing
Oh fuuu

03When the semester started I was like LOL THIS IS EASY
03because we did matrices in algebra and stuff
03but my god
So, did you guys see that ponies invaded E3?
03it just got impossible out of nowhere
And then you all died
:) Enchiladas are gonna be the death of me - if the alcohol doesn't do me in
VAL!
Eddmario: seriosly?
03and given that this assignment can mean the difference between passing and failing the class
03I kinda don't want to screw it up
I am doing something illegal right now :)
Sumica is like a green megaman
Sumica: gooby pls
Eyup. One of the booths included pony stuff

Yes, more people should get dungeon defenders
Sumica: why are we not friends on steam?
NOPE, 14,99 $ right now ._.

TheRainbowDash: If you guys are looking to set up a server mind if I join in with you? ^-^
03well
03it's like HTML
Someone is hitting on me ._.
cachi01: Everypony got a tavern in this game, derp.
lol
FlareChaser: is it me?
03IRC is a standard just like HTTP, FTP, etc etc
emangamer: yes
03it was established back in the 80s like everything else IP-related
/me winks are FlareChaser
alright, no
D:
TheRainbowDash: oh lol xD
03programs themselves can add stuff, like bold/underline is something mIRC invented, IRC protocol itself doesn't have it
so can anything be a pet in this game
FlareChaser: Who?:D Iron_Edge I only got the single-player restricted version as of right now, but plan to buy the preminum version tomorrow.
03but stuff like /me is built into IRC
Good afternoon everypony. How are we?
03don't ask why I know this much, I'm just a nerd
XAX: Good, and you?
Sumica, after this, I reccomend playing LSD: Dream Emulator.
Is this a matter of whoever's hosting the game is the owner of the tavern?
05Ponies47: so what was your question?
TheRainbowDash: lolwut? I bought Minecraft since...who knows when?

Considering the past two times I was at Disney World I didn't get a chance to ride Space Mountain (they have one in Disneyland too), I was hoping to get a chance - same with Splash Mountain which is only in California.
03But I guess it depends on everybody else. I don't need to change the plans if nobody else wanted to, did the girls care one way or the other?
dat k-line
This video confuses me, not because its confuseing. Its because I don't know how to feel about it...
Can I come?

Wrek: Okie doki loki. Mine is Ponies47 no avatar picture. But the problem is I tryed to look up some of the other ponies here it wouldn't let me for some odd reason :(
THe area where the back legs connect to the bodies looks fucked up
dat shuffeling song sucks :l
its okay :P I play Battleship all day.
What ever happened to a good ol game of monopoly
I was thinking of making a bronystate "Caramella Dansen" thing. But ehhh....not enough OC's/ships and too much time for all that animation. Just to get minor appreciation.

ponibas: You bought the Lyra plushie...
I have no plushies
execept for the WoW ones..

Meanwhile: some stuff from the shipping got some people seriously offended, and that, plus the stuff a while back with people taking the otakon shipping too far, led me to decide the shipping stuff, while funny, was more trouble than it was worth.
ponibas: yet...it's being shipped
Ok what is all this talk about this Lyra plushie!?! :o
.....
ponibas wowowow u won the plushie? O_o
RAWRity: Who gets seriously offended by that?

SayWhat: Step 1. Make a sign, and write Fluttershy. Step 2. Go to the Park and put it on a Tree. Step 3. Run like Hell. Step 4. Profit
Jspang1: hes overconfident
Shank-you for trying to bring my memory back~
I hate cats
Stallion_of_War: dawww. :(
Jspang1: It's in his programming. He prints his commands to the console :D

Shamroc: maybe too overconfident...

Ponies47: unwise decision, the cats will begin plotting against you if there is more than one of them
Needs to be about 95% more accurate

Mutterguy: shizuka is
who else thinks its a good idea to deprive myself from sleep, only because i want to hallucinate ponies?
I don't have XBOX I has PS3 it's my bro's but still :(
SayWhat: because 180 was already taken
SayWhat: ummmm, that is a good question
Winter_Shadowhooves: Nah, just do LSD
admittedly theres a whole newgrounds section on relevent thingies
CBA
that costs money
SayWhat: because ppl keep buying the same type of call of dutys for Xbox aka a full cycle
halo 4
MahBoi777: It's actually because when you look at it, you turn 360 degrees and walk away
Owwie
halo4 > COD

BRB :)
ohhh
SayWhat: well , in the totaliatarian states we live , I'd say it's quite the contrary
SayWhat: brilliant Lol
Who else thinks that this movie sucked?
This is Amareica!

Prepare to be terminated
Lol if you look in the Background.. YOU CAN SEE A FERRIS WHEEL

Jspang1: IKR
In my opinion, Phantom Mennace was one of the better Star Wars films
XD
lol the Unerminer
star wars=crap?
*underminer
Eddmario: you shittin' me ?
Eddmario: if by "better" you mean "it wasn't attack of the clones"
why didnt they make incredibles 2?
The first 3 were good
In B4 a Spray and Pray Fight
The prequels sucked
Incredibles is almost eligible again isn't it...?
:P
Eddmario: you trololo
Winter_Shadowhooves: too busy making Cars 2
NullRadix: dat movie
wasnt the underminer taken out in liike two seconds?
The Accuracy must be amazing =/
Oh my god. The ":P" face is Derpy! <3

RARRity oh god
The amount of badassery going on right now is over the GOD chartsw

that movie
nope
THE LIGHTSABER DUELS IN THE PREQUELS SUCKED
there wasnt
pew pew
DERP SPAM BULLETS
woosh
That's a lot of wasted rounds
Phantom Mennace = Empire Strikes Back > New Hope > Return of the Jedi > Revenge of the Sith > Attack of the Clones > Crappy CGI series/movie
*haters in a nutshell when ponies are entering*
Jspang1: He was at the end of the film
Bronysith: The Lightsaber duels int eh prequels were overchoreographed pieces of shit
fucking trigger happy noobs
shoot INFRONT of the robots
Bronysith: The Lightsaber duels in the prequels were overchoreographed pieces of shit
TRANSFORMERS.. DRILLS IN DISGUISE
CriticKitten: its a movie logic does not apply
Eddmario: that sure is a horrible misuse of mathematic symbols.
The old ones actually reminded me of actual sword duels
u shud have shot where he was going to be
^
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Transformers! Robots in the skies!
hobo abuse
XD
why is there a lot of black ppl doing the more impossible jobs?
...
idk
two reasons
"I do find my mind drifting to thoughts of Socrates....in that I want to drink hemlock and die."
XD
you put the rockets in the thing, then pull the trigger. its not hard
black people are awesome
black people die in movies
Eat dat wa'ermelon!
try !dice
Winter_Shadowhooves: not there evil counterparts
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: they racist
Winter_Shadowhooves: i do like black people
Drink dat purple drank!
same
Jspang1: nope, they have to get a good shot.. with all those robots flying around it
movies kill them too easily
wait, the women did something useful?
Bronysith: The original fights reminded me of actual saber duels
WHAT?
13careful..
A useful woman?
Bronysith: Like fencing.
sorry
Jspang1: wut...
13does shizu have to smack a colt?
i feel bad
Shizuka: depends
/me 13puts her smacking gloves on
These robots seem really...ineffectual. They're like turrets that are really hard to aim :|
MahBoi777: bad joke, nevermind
There's actually a series of macros taht goes over the entire light-saber duel in Phantom Menace, and how the actors NEVER actually swing at eachother.
sorry
Funny thing... There are some scenes during this where sentinels have a very good shot at attacking a robot... but they just dodge it instead
I would like to see colt smacking
^
ZUKO
Bronysith: I can't remember the last time I pulled a B-Twist in a fight
Shizuka: I imagine htat with that snapping back sound when you let go of the gloves when you stretch them into your hand
this is me
Oshit
13ze smacking leaves little time for ze wubbing
At this time.. Robots are just trolling the ppl
its just like galaga
13you know, as bad as the film is
13good effects
SayWhat: Hoof!
ZEEEEEEEEEEEERG RUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUSH
Shizuka: but the wubbing is needed
True
Very shiney
11,01Lol.
they need a bass cannon
Wait a sec......why don't they just use wate guns to short-circuit the robots?
badly
CriticKitten: Lol, sorry master
13especially after watching the making of, and just how much green screen there is
Shizuka: decent CG, but I miss the practical set pieces from the first.
Shizu is filly, remember, so they're smacking gloves for hooves. :p
I get it now. THIS IS THE BIRTH OF TOWER DEFENCE!
theres so many robaots, and as many as you shoot, theres stil; 40000000000000000000000000 more
use a super soaker
NO! they need pocket sand
13CriticKitten: but i am filly unicorn
How does it fire?
13i can smack with magic :3
or a water type pokemon
mutterguy LOL
Squirtle!
OH SH**
yeah
Shizu: Truedat
Shizuka: You're a silly filly
Winter_Shadowhooves: How did you place him like that ?
13also fun fact
the oc?
Like that shoutout in the office lobby in Matrix 1? FUCKING AMAZING. The playground scene in matrix 2: OH GOD THE CG.
13the mythbusters crew worked on this movie
yes
Shizuka: haha
*shootour
Shizu: OH! In that case you should smack with an iron glove like in Robin Hood: Men in Tights.
YES MORE DRILLS!
Lobby scene in Matrix 1 <3
Shizuka: Seems Liget
*shootout
looking at scenes from the show
13it's true
original vector
13tori is in the making of at once point iirc
13adam too
Winter_Shadowhooves: so you drwan it ?
drawn*
sorta
11,01Fun fact: Fun facts are fun.
03!dice
Winter_Shadowhooves: what do you mean ?
So if we get enslaved by these set prop, we can forever blame mythbusters....
Micheal bay made this before he became obsessed with explosions
How do they have so much ammo?
indeed Nittany_Discord
Nittany_Discord: unless I'm making those funfact.
Nittany_Discord: AND factual!
no colour
This is better than the Shamalamadingdong movie about a kid fighting off human flamethrowers
XD
i cant draw for shit. I used a puppet i made
Mythbusters can make good stuff, but writers they are not.
yes mr robot, when you get to the ship, land directly on the electrical pad
Dem philosophical quotes
Fun fact: I have a 5 inch Scootaloo
BACK :)
just placed the peices together
it alwalys works
13well sentinels are clearly very VERY expendable
Maybe if each gunner didn't have 9 monitors it would be easier to aim? :|
Its a movie, there is no ammo limit
Bronysith: Hahaha, I'll bet it was xD
and designed of that
13so better to zerg rush ALL the things
^
Shizuka: they're mostly suicide attackers
look at my gallery
Winter_Shadowhooves: do you think you coulkd give some pose that gives life to my OC ?
Has no learned from Commando
for instance, Funfact: after the "bloodbending" episode in A:TLA, the first fic to feature it was one where Katara used bloodbending to...*ahem* force a response from Zuko.
sure
like i said Shizuka... tower defence
KEKEKEKEKE
I would be happy to
Kek
13RAWRity: but zuko fell off the bridge
WoW fans will get this
Acheron187: unless your hawkeye, but no one cares about him
/me 11,01defends
its 4:49am so i cant do anything now
Winter_Shadowhooves: also Y U NO USE REPLY
Shizuka: that didn't stop her.
KATARA'S LUST CANNOT BE SATED
why is there no halo movie...
...
alister sorry
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: They're making one
RAWRity: dat lust
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: because Video Game movies kind of suck?
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Not even kidding
can haz rawket lawnchairs
13Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: you do know they cancelled the halo movie so that District 9 could be made right?
Her luck sucks.
XD
Alistar could I have a link to your oc?
SayWhat: i know but 343 made a trailer for halo 4 that could have been a movie =/
I've seen enought hentai to know where this is going...
also, do we really NEED a Halo movie? You have the cut scenes and story from the game itself.
I've seen enough hentai
damnit
i love all the pings i instantly got
seen too much hentai to know where robot tentacles is going
....wait, srsly Shizu?
13yep
Alister thanks
IMPOSSIBRU
np
That man is playing Galaga!
Uh. I think the Halo movie might have ended up BETTER than District 9. So I don't consider that a fair trade. ;_;
Ba-Bakana! :O
13neil blomkamp was working on a halo movie, i think it was cancelled and peter jackson approached him to do blomkamp's student film as a full thing
SayWhat: LOL
UAV ONLINE
MahBoi777: If ya know hat I mean
13and yeah halo at least makes a try for worldbuilding, would have worked better than district 9's LOOK LOOK APARTHEID BUT WITH ALIENS
Bronysith: Yeah , cuz a SITH LORD would fit right in , in equestria
SayWhat: I know what you mean - Nice
jk
Shizu: Agreed.
It's not like when you have a comic book or a film, where part of the experience is seeing the things described or drawn put into motion. A video game serves no purpose other than to shove a game's story into 2 hours, often with worse visuals.
SIR, DROP THE HAMER
SayWhat: nice indeed
Alister: non canon. Not part of The OT so... spiderman.mp4
stop, it's hammer time
Alister I will have a vector done by tommorow
Still an hour left of the movie?
13now granted i never played 3, but halo is also a very colorful series from what i recall
Yeah.
Winter_Shadowhooves: really ? many thanks
13would have been better than district 9's brown and grey
You know what I wonder?
Shizuka: Its what made the Xbox 360 what it is
FOR GOD SAKE OPEN THE SILO DOOR! ITS OUR ONLY WAY OUT
o.o
Shizuka: it is, yes. Hopefully Halo 4 keeps that up.
How different would this movie be if Neo took both the red and blue pill at the same time?
Shizuka: without halo for the original Xbox.. it would had crashed and failed
Alister Thats ok. I dont have that much to do anyway, it will be fun
STAY OUTTA MY SILO
13well there's that
bobody got that reference
I love Halo
MahBoi777: tf2 better... sry
GenaricBrony375 He would have choked on them
All shooters are bad, the end!
that zerg rush
SayWhat: i used to think that... then i played tf2
:D Chiropratic bots
lol
Shizu: Yeah, District 9's visuals were just atrocious. They felt like a brown-grey video game with less plot and a less likeable main character. Halo might not have been a great movie but UI imagine it would've been interesting at aleast. >_>
*least
Armored Core all the way.
MahBoi777: your not alone man
13yeah
HOW DO YOU STILL HAVE AMMO?
RAWRity: I'd want to see that movie
Om: Oh my god Armoured core
almost spit my beer :D
Bronysith: Meh, TF2 is kinda fun but still. I just don't like the genre at all
SPRAY AND PRAY
Jspang1: I'm not ashamed lol
He has been shooting for like thirty minutes
I'm just hearing Flight of the Valcyries while watching this
neither am I
District 9 couldnt decide what stlye it was
CriticKitten: they got their bullet magazines from the guy who made Legolas' arrow quiver in LotR
SayWhat: well yea. considering most of them nowadays want to be cod and shit and RPGS ARE BETTER... except skyrim
Om: I remember playing Last Raven all the time
11,01Lo.
i swear to god if that cart tips
11,01Lol.
Om: And then I remember 4 and 4Answer sucked.
Nittany_Discord: wat
oh hai level 3 sentry gun
11,01*cart tips* *Movie over*
RAWRity: Oh, so "it's magic, bitch"?
Nittany_Discord: haha
Fair enough
sentry down!
:'( Red Hots!
Bronysith: Finally another RPG enthusiast that doesn't like Skyrim like me
CriticKitten: more like the machine reloads every time they cut away from it.
Nittany_Discord: Train doesnt come for Neo. Roll Credits
Om: Played 5 yet?
Bronysith: I play RPG's and stuff, but to be honest, too many of them are trying to be WoW. Too many horrible flashbacks and memories
so they have only one good mech solider
Alister: I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE
of course its jammed
lol
what is going on?
I noticed none of the ammo carriers returned
TROLL SENTINELS
Alister: /)
Things being ded
Just like how Legolas suddenly gets a full set of arrows every time the camera turns away from him.
Bronysith: Please tell me you hated Mass Effect 3 too ?
why are the robots trying to kill them?
NOM NOM NOM
Alister: never played it
NNOOOOOOOOOO!
Winter_Shadowhooves: who knows
SENTRY DOWN
Bronysith: /)
Winter_Shadowhooves: the robots want to enslave humanity because...reasons.
xD
Om: Oh, I was wondering if someone has played it yet.
of course
Winter_Shadowhooves: robots are evil
Just Die plox
you know, if the robots would come at him from different directions, maybe their results would be different
yeah
Don't you hate it when that happens to you? Trying to mind your own business and all thse robot bugs swarm you. Happens to me daily
Winter_Shadowhooves Watch all of the "Animatrix" for the reason why
11,01Evil are robots.
CriticKitten: He tried to bathe you!
WAIT! Which gate am I opening?
't have it from lack of money :$
Robots = EVIL! :o
i saw the first movie
Nittany_Discord: kek
If Sentinels werent so synchronized... this fight would have lasted 3 minutes
HIS OWN DAMN FAULT. I dun want a bath. D:<
Realistically
I has tongue for that.
When I heard that for the first time
I was like
"Whut"
Yay! Things doing things!
CriticKitten: but your tongue licks your asshole all the time!
This hour of internet is always so boring :U
CriticKitten: you are spreading poop all over your body!
FOR GODS SAKE OPEN THE SILO DOOR! ITS OUR ONLY WAY OUT! #nobody gets that reference

Cypresswolf: wat now?

Is thst kid gay for Neo?

Bronysith: Bed? It's 11:00 PM :P
Eddmario: that's not R34
RAWRity: Why.
03that's because you suck
Nittany_Discord: good for you
Bronysith: you might not like them , They offer the same amount of RPG goodness but it's a dungeon crawler instead of a FPS
RARRity NO>JPEG
CriticKitten: it's adorable. and it's not r34.
Alister: okay
She's in R34 events though
BE BACK IN A BIT BYE! :)

Om: Hahaha I bought it 'cause I used to play it with my friend
Huray! 2!
Lol
I love a happy ending
50 mins?
She must be Zelda
Link?
zelda?
08,01my god, i am knackered
The number of players has been doubled!
not over yet people
13of course
11,01Z!
Did you find the Triforce?
Wait... Where are the negatives?!
Shizuka: now you're concerned? not when I was writing a story about meanwhile doing mature things with trixie?
13you realize what we still have to get through
LInk sauseges > Sausege patties
Q
13op first THEN speak :3
13silly filly

Well , this is all for me good night Everypony !

Sooo, there is a 50 minutes of falling action?
Bronysith: am I screwed? :D
Alister: good luck with her
FlareChaser: with what?
XD
good night Alister
Thanks
Om: yes
You PPL
wow
what now that they wasted there entire special effects budget
Bronysith: you know...that thing.. >.>
08,01i was on Sketchy Sounds' stream again tonight, and then BUCK stuff happened, and then I was jamming and chatting with Sketchy
13oh no
Jspang1: That sounds like poor planing on the movies part.
Om: yes, get ready to experience the full unbridled glory of gravity
08,01and now it's 5am
13they have plenty of effects budget to burn left
Om: Lol, that's nothing. In "A Seperate Peace," a 200 page book, the climax is on page 60
the funny thing is.. they're going to reuse the machines for bullets
Om: yes
haha
08,01Bronysith: what?
FlareChaser: oh the yaying?
MahBoi777: Hurray! Gravity
seal the shaft =/
Bronysith: ...you can say that.
my shaft is sealed
YAY
08,01Shizuka: apparently, i'm now glomped into you
TROLL MACHINES
08,01clearly, we're some kind of Gundam now
Welp ded

08,01i should tune in
MahBoi777: Okay...now what?
To Bee or not to Bee, that is the question
he will not have a single scrap of acting talent
08,01Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: i'm not watching it at the moment
rifftrax, pretty sure mum fell asleep through these
11,01Sucks that I missed the original rifftraxed.
Funfact: There's still like another hour of poorly paced fight scenes left
08,01because ZOMG, suddenly everyone is contacting me
as long as he shall ever leave
08,01i'm scared to open skype
13first one is way way stretched though
WHERE DID NEO GET THE BLINDFOLD?
Petrified_Discord: oh damn....didn't think you'd get this far.... hang on
Look at all those Queen Injects

I'm a bee now
Micro Zergs
/me consults "coin flipping for dummies"
Oh Hai Striders
MahBoi777: Fuck it!
/me glomps MahBoi777

13bees?
13no no
Not the bees!
13berries!
wuts with neo now?
08,01berries are bees, thouhg
Acheron187: he took crack
He can see them! Even though he's no longer in the Matrix! Because reasons so shut up!
They're in my eyeeeees! Not that it matters but still! :O
/me 08,01points to the topic
Lol
That makes sense
Why not both?
"Not the bees" Funny quote from an Asian dad... and some movie
11,01Screw berries and bees. It's time to clean!
CriticKitten: this movie's logic in a nutshell
oh gawd
Keanu has had exactly 2 believable performances in movies. And those movies both begin with "Bill and Ted's"
Not the things!
13duelling nicktrends!
Maid_Discord: ಠ_ಠ
-_-
anything but things!
08,01BeeChaser: it's 'greystripe', with an 'e'
Well its 5:06am Friday. I need to go
Seeya later
08,01BeeChaser: i used to be known as that in the furry community
None what so evah
gnight Winter_Shadowhooves! sleep well
gmorning
CriticKitten: The idea is basically that, after what happened in the end of Reloaded, he's got a wireless connection to the Matrix
Winter_Shadowhooves: may the force keep you from nightmares
XD
/)
08,01BeeChaser: what?
It's Lee Sin!
RAWRity: That's interesting. Too bad it makes no sense and wasn't really explained.
Oh my gog!
Neo was years ahead of Wireless 4G hotspots.
this movie has the weirdest plot
Winter_Shadowhooves: (\
skype**
did you guys ever see back to the future? only 3 more years til flying cars!
It's like a video game!
BeeChaser: Skype too manestream?
Dark and dismal!
BeeChaser: gotta use Slype?
13dunno about you guys
All it needs is a field of chest high walls
13but i want defenses like that
My real name is:
Shizuberry: BUK YEA
Look Broodlings
Frodo BAggins
It really is Lee Sin!
NEO the jedi
/me explodes
I know the force

11,01Pooping bomb guns?
Acheron187: false
So now he has superpowers in real life?
Dat metaphor
Bronysith: true.
11,01Or bomb-pooping guns?
Acheron187: he is not a jedi cause jedi are actually kewl
08,01i want to hug everyone
Bronysith: you have a point there
lol
wat?
/me is glad his seed of dispaiir has been planted in the minds of the mods
He obsorbed a squid soul!
Muhahahahahaha
and then Bill shows up in the phone booth and has tells Neo how to defeat the machines.
mutterguy_: OH GOD
13EXCELLENT

Bronysith: ..do you like starcraft?
BeeChaser: wow you have to basiccally have a second job
Bronysith: kek
Don't stare at it!
Acheron187: o god I cant unthink that now

Again.

"You can't die!" Well actually, she's been stabbed in several places so yeah, she's probably going to bleed out from that and....oh, metaphorically.
keanu, just stop. you arent convincing anybody
08,01Gurren Langan
11,01XD
Oh How I love these guy
You should have riffed FLCL. The squid episode alone would have broke him.
tom servo is gonna hurt himself
GET ON WITH IT :)
this guy is awesome
I really want to see there commentary on Twilight
11,01Them poles.
He's kinda annoying =/
He feels strongly about those poles
and just see them ruin it
FUCKING DIE ALREADY! WHAT IS THIS COD!
13you'll have to convince someone else to grab that riff :3
that feeling
08,01RAWRity: at some point, i'd love to riff FLCL, actually
maid, so if she gets up and starts dancing, she'd be a ... pole dancer... YEEEAAAAHHH
08,01i should record it at some point
08,01oh, also!
DIE ALREADY!!!! OR ...........CUUUUUUUUT

08,01i might test it on you all later
What commentary is this? It's hilarious!
YOU ARE DED... NOT BIG SURPRISE!
and then he started jerking it over her comatose body.
08,01once i've fleshed it out
LOOOOOOOOOOL
Now he is blind.
She's dead, Jim!
yay stand-up
13VOGUE
Oh wait, that's a DIFFERENT disappointing ending to a classic Sci-fi series.
never mind.
Acheron187: because everyone knows when you get gutshot you have 30 minutes to kill the antag and then make a speech
They all have aspergers
13RAWRity: well... they did cut away
13and neo is a bit powerful but doesn't know how to use it...
Shizuberry: yeah, but the boobs wouldn't do anything for him now.
this works
13and just spent that scene all moody...
has Zoolander been aired yet?
13dear god this is eva
This works? right? :D
Shizuberry: too bad Keannu can't pull off the SHinji scream.
So Rule 3 then?
Hey guys can anyone tell me what this commentary is?
08,01only thing is, one of the thigns i started writing evolved into a rap with a misdirect about doing naughty things to a certain actor...
13right down to the mind destroying philosophy
11,01So many tubes an cylinders.
Derpy i love you... PLEASE STAY OUT OF MY COMPUTER
OH LOOK, HE CAN SEE AGAIN, THAT'S CONVENIENT
/me noms on crushed ramen noodles
08,01so i can't do it at BUCK
Hoo?
pff, Keanu can barely pull "walk"
Q?
CriticKitten: He can see robot stuff, not real stuff.
Thanks
11,01XD
I cant but think of the RED,GREEN,BLUE thing
YAY PLOT CONVENIENCE!
lol!
LOOK NEW JERSEY
those robots are, uh, real within the context of the movie tho
I would not mind a fondue city
Pertified_Discord: And yet he couldn't see on board the large machine-y starship?
Videofreak1127: i concur

hey teh|PheonixWright
that name was long :3
a face
OH HAI PROPHET
13oh my KMPlayer, brought out that bass real nice here
Shizuberry: Meh, Eva was more mind-breaking contemplation. An examination of Shinji's many, many personality flaws. This is more obtusely talking about high concepts while completely misunderstanding technology.
08,01anyhoos, i'm rambling now
Hey all.
ZERG RUSH KEKEKEKEK
08,01i've drank way too much Irn Bru, and eaten not enough pizza
hey Randomnerd
Bronysith: omgilovejennidashsomuch
HAY GUYZ, NEO CAN SEE WITH THE LIGHT, BUT CAN HE SEE WHY KIDS LOVE THE GREAT TASTE OF CINNAMON TOAST CRUNCH?!
13i love that they're from minnesota cause they make so many good jokes only minnesotans get :3
11,01XD
Shizuberry: They never mention Garrison Keillor, though!
FlareChaser: she is awesome. i already got her working on my next one
08,01all that's missing with this night is smoking, booze, and special hugs
OH GOD
wtf?
Shizuberry: I agree
and then Tenticle rape
I've seen enough Zone to know where this is going...
Tentacle rape
08,01not that i advocate any of those things.
I haz a doughnut!
13they mention lake woebegone at one point though
We've seen enough hentai to know this
...ew.

13go tip over a sentinel!
08,01Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: what's hentai?

MahBoi777: NOT

11,01XD
NEO FIGHTS FOR THE USERS
call apon the sea ponies when you're in distress
call upon the sea ponies, when you're in distress.
Though to be fair. As boring as Neo is as a character, he's still more likeable than Shinji.
Something Wicked This Way Comes
08,01mutterguy_: i love the stuff, but then again i'm rather scottish
Look at all the Geico ppl
Bronysith: nice! whats it look like? :)

Is this a fight scene of absurdity?
Acheron187 no it's a western rip off
What the kitteh?!?! How did you get on my screen?!?!!
It's air fu
MahBoi777: Spike at the very end of Magic.mov
Is there a Rifftrax of Dragonball: Evolution?
not the glass unicorns!
Mozdoc: yes
God I just...I am happy ._.
I am happy now.
13Eddmario: yes, done by TeamFourStar
13ded srs
you cant kill me, i know kung fu
FlareChaser: yay.
SayWhat: Oh yeah Lol
You know, if Neo's supposed to be able to do anything in the Matrix...couldn't he just move faster than Smith can percieve and destroy him?
I mean done by these guys Shizuberry
FlareChaser: don worry be happy
Shizuberry, I need to investigate...
:D I think I might play WoW for victory.
13not these guys
MahBoi777: Jk, my catch phrase is SayWhat. Guess why
the finger
RAWRity: you have WoW?
FlareChaser: kek?
/me loops mortal kombat theme
FlareChaser: nope.
aww
Hello!
13so Team FourStar did Dragonball, ThatGuyWithTheGlasses did Lion King (which I have)
SayWhat: why's that?:P
I have become the DJ PON-3
13and there's others
11,01Are they done by others?
hey Love_n_Tolerance
MahBoi777: Seems.... fitting
13yep
Mowing a flaming lawn must be awesome.
INB4 Guile's Theme
13ROUND 4
11,01It'd be funny if the rifftrax guys did the fan ones.
I know they'e goofing around, but the martial arts scenes in this fight are the best parts of the fights because the actually look real.
SayWhat: it IS very fitting, how strange
FlareChaser: I used to have WoW, then I quit for heroin. It was a lot more fun and a lot less addicting
this is the most wierd ass fight scene ever
wait, why are the other smiths just sitting on their asses again?
Course they can fly.
Acheron187: i agree
When did Smith learn how to fly?
13smith is so certain of his victory
I dont know why everyone says WoW is addicting, its not you just let yourself become addicted because you think everyone else is..
13that's my favorite shot in the movie
RAWRity: o
Wow
11,01XD
Smith is a Water Bender =/
well then
13the one big slomo
RAWRity: I don't remember that O_o
FlareChaser: WoW is a giant slot machine
GIMME A HUG
11,01Well, Smith has psychic powers.
SONIC RAINBOOM!!!
Plus, you know, he beats ONE smith, still got an entire world of them to stop.
awww
no pretty colors
NullRadix You're thinking of TF2
Shizuberry have you been to the biggest ball of twine in your lifetime?
Love_n_Tolerance: you new?
13nope

FATALITY
Big_Macintosh_1992: kinda
...or not
that was anti-climactic
well... mmo anything tends to boil down to giant slot machines
then agian, i have yet to Bungijump
Acheron187: you think THAT was anticlimactic? JUST WAIT
flawless victory, smith wins, FATALITY
GET UP ATOM!!!!
Love_n_Tolerance: welcome

noooo
GET UP!
Big_Macintosh_1992: thanks
NullRadix: Nope, only the priest shoulders dropped
but was just checking out
God, these sequels pissed me off.
no, its so i can punch you and yell "FALCON PUNCH"
hey Big_Macintosh_1992!
sure, there are game aspects, and they can be fun... but at the end of the day most people get drawn in by power lust, which is fueld by slot machine mechanics
Love_n_Tolerance: ok.
NullRadix: /roll *SayWhat rolls a 72 (1-100)
13at least here smith's character is showing well
11,01I didn't mind the sequels.

Aahahahah Noo No NO It's not fair....
11,01So shiny!
awww, those shades were the best part about this movie
00,10buhahahaha
That's right everybody: Neo, the hero of the ENTIRE FRANCHISE ultimately ammounts to a Trojan malware that beats the bad guy.
"Every now and then I fall apart..."
prep the friendship beam....
KABOOM!
that total eclipse of the heart
FIRE!
Looks like a bad case of constipation.
11,01Lol.
13best riff ever right here
I've been waiting to say that
oh he dead
XD
ENOUGH WITH THE RAIN
Neo's ENTIRE PLAN would have failed if Smith had updated his Avast Anti-Virus.
I swear
I find it hilarious for her to be wearing a full body catsuit :P
Oh look, it's that woman who should be dead.
HOORAY FOR NORTON ANTI VIRUS
If I see any more water, I'm gonna strangle somepony
"Let's blow this taco stand!"
so what happened?
Acheron187: no clue
no idea
lol
Shizuberry: ...what kind of berry is the best berry?
For he loved mankind so much, yadda yadda yadda.
mmmmm Tacos

So Neo sacrificed himself to save everything...but how the hell did he even come to that realization?
he guessed?
I paid my dues....WEEEE ARE THE CHAMPIIONS, MY FRIEEENDS!

i love how this guy is the only one announcing it
Viviberry? Sounds nummy.
he saved us by not destroying the machines
Mozdoc: apparently right before he went into the Matrix to fight Smith.

Stop screaming!
/me 11,01is over

This is worst than the Mass Effect 3 ending
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4808/
why was will smith not neo, he would be amazing for it
THE WAR IS OVER! And now we really don't have anything to do because that's all we had, and... crap.
Now we can try to clear the damn clouds from the sky.
11,01Censorship?
No time for LOSERS, cause we ARE THE CHAMPIONS.....OF THE WORRRRRRRLLLLDDD!!
Ha
11,01XD
Jspang1: he decided to do "Wild Wild West" instead.
LOL
I think somehow it was revealed in the second movies confusing as fuck jargon and peoples roles as programs and computer...stuff. Because that's about all I remember of the second movie.
oh sh--- he's me????
wooo
Petrified_Discord: lol
RAWRity: really?
I like this song
11,01XD
no joke, Will Smith was slated to be Neo, but instead chose to be in the movei with the giant Steampunk spider.
Little else about this movie
oh god no more tentacles plz
RAWRity: which, lets face it, had better writers than this
Jspang1: look at how well that turned out
awesome
Soooo, neo. Is the machines now?

Your Reign of Rain is over, Rain!
:D what is this commentary?
Copied.
Why is it that the actors and actresses in these movies are good, it's just the fucking mateiral!!?!
11,01The Matrix still exists, but the war is over.
MOOO
Mutterguy: dafuq?
11,01They struck a truce.
This ending sucks!
It's a brand new day

inb4 Matrix 4
ha nice
now i wonder why
...In the online MMORPG
But she is a daugher, not a sun.
and then the machines realized the truce sucks and attacked again
This ending leaves room for a sequal
its a brand new day
We will find Neo :P
11,01The Matrix ended on a MMO sadly.
CriticKitten: they're planning a matrix remake, so...it could happen.
Beeeelliiieeeeeeeved

Has anyone ever noticed that the Soviet Union's anthem is very similar to the SSBB theme?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_Online Lol someone on wiki put Gay 13 instead of May 13
14 minutes seems legit, when they show one name at a time for EVERY CREW MEMEBER!
:)
Videofreak1127: Mind = Blown
are you saying the russians battle on fantasy platforms?! Videofreak1127:
I've never heard the Soviet Union's anthem
Mr. ANnndeeeeerrsssooon.

08,01derpy_pony: my god, please no
Mr Anderson....
08,01no no no, they're gonna fuck it up... please holywood, stop destroying books i love
Like I said, Keannu Reaves has 2 good performances in his repetoir: Excellent Adventure, and Bogus Journey
Ya know, wouldn't it have been awesome if Agent Smith didn't call Neo 'Mr. Anderson' until the third movie?
I HAVE SINGLEHANDEDLY MADE NINTENDO SEEM EVIL!
if it's bad, it will be ignored anyway

08,01derpy_pony: like Golden Compass

That entire section with the Quarter Quell was completely pointless, and just a reason to shove more actions scenes in. To the point where Mockingjay had to SHOVE its storyline into a single book just to accomadate the need for a "twist" ending.

Instead of the Quarter Quell, just have Katniss and Peeta be abducted at the capitol when they finish the world tour. Then have the rebels arrive THEN to rescue Katniss, and reveal Heveansbee as a rebel conspirator. Then the second half is Katniss going to D13. Hell, you can even have the surprise ending! Just end the story with the scene in Mockingjay where they rescue Peeta.

I'm going off a bit for some Amnesia, I'll be back later. See every
well, I've gotta get up early tomorrow. I'm showing a bunch of my friends my collection of awful anime!
sexy love interest check
MahBoi777: Hush now quiet now, its time to let me steal your things
its as if these people don't like shows that are really half-hour long toy commercials. :D
Now we get to see the three Zentradi spies discover the joys of dating.
wait, Rick led?
lady facepalm
First off, Garzey's Wing. Next, Eiken! Then... MASTER OF MARTIAL HEARTS
Rick was the team leader protecting Lisa.
He was technically commander, althout Lisa was the ranking officer.
00,10did't earth command say dont go home yet.
yes they did
Om: Lol
tf2 noob spies in a nutshell
Holy shit, I've been gone from here almost 2 weeks now, Hey guys, how is everyone?
I'm going to have to marathon like a baws to get ahead so I can give the kind of commentary I want to.
Oh, My name
Dere
00,10speed change
nekkid powers
And the rule of logic begins to FAIL the spies.
oh in oblvin
Crossdressing powers activate!
this needs someone to riff it
08,01cupcakes, so sweet and tasty
actually it's not irrational... "there are clothes in that room"
So anyway, I'm off everybody.
SUIT UP
lockpicking fsail FOrce open?
See you later!
08,01cupcakes, don't be too hasty
later RAWRity take care
08,01cupcakes! cupcakes, cupcakes, cupcakes!
13sandvich! I'M COMING FOR YOU
so many blank looks
Kencolt: they really don't know any better.
his moustache and accent make him the leader
and u never get your FILLA
00,10wait, did't the camera break?
annnd they think sexx is icky
we must get the proto-culture
get the SLDF-1
The officers on the SDF1 are models of professionalism
what exactly is protoculture?
the internet
dramatic pipe
gee i wonder whos the villian
macross/robotech has aways had silly plot...cool mecha though
always
protoculture sounds like something from cthulhumech
Protoculture in Macross is totally different from what it is in Robotech.
Windlash, how fun is Cthullumech?
lol
Protoculture in Robotech is a biologically-derived energy source.
what is protoculture in macross?
-_(\
Protoculture in Macross was just the name of the first makor galactic civilization that created the Zentradi.
As in the first culture.
In Macross, Protoculture was a pre-existing society that scared the HELL out of the Tzentradei. IN RObotech, it's a energy source that is reponsible for both power and mechamorphosis.
lol
geeky-brony: how are you?
Sooooo the same energy that's extracted from the Matrix? I mean di the Wachowiskys still more material?
Someone's read the novels, I see,'
In both it's hardly ever really explained.
*steal
MahBoi777: ima good
she looks high all the time
geeky-brony: gooood
MahBoi777: how r y
to punish them for their evil ways, we shall expose them to the singing of our greatest weapon
God, those eyes.
*u
geeky-brony: I'm fine lol
MahBoi777: lol
Alright kids! Flare is gonna go to bed! <3 you all night!
Have all the novels. Most are pretty good, I could slap McKinzey-- BOTH OF THEM-- for the Zentraedi Rebellion.
I like Macross 7, where Max is captain of the ship.
Oh my
ha lol thay angry
Kencolt: I read those things in high school.
Let's hear her ONE SONG!
the power of music
I generally like macross when is isn't harmony gold or robotech.
DocSane: NO
I saw the novels only once. Never could find em again, but whatev
And I'm here now, scared stiff/My name is not Biff
Sumica: permission for text dump on Protoculture?
Does she only know that one song?
at this point in the story, yes.
Om: THey write more for her later on.
Actually, she's got more than one. Unfortunately, they are all sung by Reba West.
I think in Macross she had more different songs.
im......... dieing..... i.............. need ... metal
Robotech was really damn cheap with the music in these early episodes.
Good, cuse this one is. Not. Great.
DeathStar: awesome
that looks good DeathStar!
...WHY CAN'T SHE SING LIKE JIGGLYPUFF>
DeathStar: cutetasticly fantastic
music is the worst part of robotech/macross
00,10if you want
Mutterguy: agred
Oh, but you haven't heard "To Be In Love" yet.
Actually, at the time, it was pretty close to most J-Pop of the era. :P
Brrrr....
Thanks.
DeathStar: Makes me wana dance
MahBoi777 geeky-brony Spectrum_Rush thanks guys ^-^
:)
does anybody have a copy of macross dyrl?
Om: awesome :D
Okay. Where did that get cut off?
DeathStar...STILLLL SNOOOOW!
why does she like shes from a minstrel show? (noo offense)
The Supervision Armies (aka The Reconnaisances Forces) had a good reason to fight.
she always looks so tired...or high
Mutterguy: no snow where i am
As they had ben taken over by eldrich horrors from another dimension.
all the orders
That is a great overview of sdf macross, except for a couple details.
hes a ass
Evening, everypony! :) how are we all tonight?
hi Sylandest
evenig Sylandest
drive up closer, I want to hit it with my sword!
Sylandest: You are late!
hi sylandest. doing just fine
00,10now slam on the breaks and watch them try to stop
/me hugs DeathStar, geeky-brony, Om, Starlight_Phoenix
evenin Sylandest! how are you?:D
man if he popped that collar it would destroy the universe
Om: I have good reason to be, lol
Where in RObotech, Protoculture is a organic energy source derived from the Flowers of Life-- unique to one planet originally, but scattered by a mysterious being called Haydon. It's unusual properties make clean and abundany energy possible, as well as making transformations possible-- something only Humans managed to really make work. Being of such potency, wars erupted over this power source, when the Master Zor stole the flo
i just noticed that ship has a bunch of bridge bunnies
Sylandest: Excuses.
I love how the SDF-1's bridge looks like an actual aircraft carrier bridge.
MahBoi777: tired but alright. to be honest, not in the best of mental well-beings
Vermillion? But that's... Rick's squadron.
Kencolt: that got cut off with "when the Master Zor stole the flo"
Om: believe what you will, lol. Its what im going with
/me looks over at his big Veritech toy on the mantelpiece.
Sylandest: Alright. Fair enough.
I have some Masterpiece Macross fighters, they are pretty sweet
00,10and then the spys died
Om: I would debate it in a comical fashion, but my current state of mind...I just can't do it. I'm sorry
DeadpoolDash: I own a VF-1A with Super Valkyrie armore.
me too
Stoile tyhe flowers from another race-- thus starting the RObotech Wars. When Zor sent the SDF-1-- and the last Protoculture Matrix-- to Earth (and he planned it that way) well... this all started up.
idots are idots
more than meets the eye
IS THIS WHAT I THINK IT IS? :o
Sylandest: Perfectly fine.
panda: You are late too!
00,10I have the VT1 Super ostrich
DeadpoolDash: I wanted an Alpha fighter with Beta, but could never justify the cost.
hey panda!
Om: :( am not! at least im here!
MahBoi777: :D whatsu p
deliberately yes, swiftly no
and shit is about to get real
/me jumps into chat
00,10that's the one with the extra boosters on top
panda: I'm watching you >.>
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: howdy!
Om: :( what did I do now?
heya All :D :P

panda: >.>
Suddenly, back in ship mode
http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y218/KristofBowen/case/10.jpg
This episode was one of those that Studio Nue and Artland farmed out to Tatsunoko Production studios-- who in turn farmed it out to its offshoot Anime Friend, who farmed it out yet again to Star Pro.
panda: not much, u?
If you notice that a certain episode is not quite up to par, chances are good that you'll find Star Pro in the credits
panda, he's been singing 'every breath you take'....
I didn't have to split that up
didn't macross have a full barrier?
eat my potatos!!!
Starlight_Phoenix: not at this point
Starlight_Phoenix: Later on in the series.
And when they did have one-- well...
00,10you had only one ship they have fleet
Gladly!!
I thought so
Starlight_Phoenix: Its use had...consequences.
00,10you are always outnumbered
http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y218/KristofBowen/case/2.jpg
Sumica: Which automagically means you win.
like in nadesico?
DeadpoolDash: is tha ur stuff
yes
wooooow
DeadpoolDash: awesome
Om: you are singing to me?
old pics though, have way more stuff now
MahBoi777: same... sleepy though
00,10seems like a great shape to make reintry in
panda: What?
11,01Sumiyay stream again?
panda: me too, long day lol
I love this Ulpio Minucci music.
Om: why are you watching me :(
http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y218/KristofBowen/case/8.jpg
/me glomps panda "PANDA!!!!"
The Lone SHip agains insane odds was really pioneered in Uchu Senkan Yamato-- AKA Star Blazers. Macross and Nadesico both had aspect of the theme.
Aye all
panda: You and Sylandest were both late. Verry suspicous.
belly all the flops
Sup Mutterguy. How's the weather? :l
XAX: aye
the nostalgia critic should definitly review this
Om: wait what? I just got home!
00,10who knew it could float
Om: my being late was due to my television and dealing with people, lol
DeathStar: I DIDNT SEE YOU!
/me hugs DeathStar
panda: You admit it!
Sylandest: People like panda!?
XAX collllllllld but sunny
Need.To.Do.Own.Work
Fuck the rules, I'm smoking my damn pipe!
Om: admit what?

And damn it, he's gonna smoke, bridge or not!
Om: nah...worse :D I kid, panda's not bad at all
panda: You were out doing things >.>
mutterguy_: Aye. It's average here. But god it gets chilly at nights now
Sylandest: So now you admit it!
Just a pile of rust/was all they found on that isle...
00,10meanwhile they just wiped out the wset coast with a titalwave caused by the landing
lol
mutterguy_: Though you got it worse though, I guess.
Om: yes? though I'm not quite sure what I'm admitting to, lol
10 years later, super fortress Macross would rise/Guardian of you and of me!
Sumica: no one will notice that problem a few episodes from now
Sylandest: I see. Very interesting indeed....
Om: :/ i needed help on my homework and I requested a friend help me... it was completely innocent :(
very suspicious
panda: Likeley story.
XAX, yeah could be still snowing
Om: you confuzzle me on this late evening, sir..and MahBoi777, not you too!
And now for those who don't understand what went before-- the obligatory clip episode.

Amazing that the song that made Eduard Khil so famous in the last years of his life only became what it was because of censorship.

He had lyrics for that song, but the government wouldn't allow him to use them because they were too "un-Soviet"

Sumica: Wet Mane Hour is the hour when theres no stream and wet mane pics are posted
Oh my god

But before I watch this, I want to watch all of Avatar since I've only seen a few stray episodes on TV. Anyone know if there's a place I can watch it online?

00,10seems legit
This one was good.
twilight_sprinkle: LOL just what I was thinkin

Ma mi-mi ^-^
04He left in September
11,01So, Maid Hour, Wet Mane Hour, and Fruit Hour.
11,01Hmm.
occupy ALL the hours
THis series actually sonsists not only of two or three animes, but a series of PS2 games, in which you play a gamer playing a MMORPG-- which is simulated in a single player console based CRPG. Yes, it's wierd. And you don't understand everything without playing the game inside the game.
I've heard this story, Ghosties
Strawberry_Discord: WET MANE HOUR?!?!?!?!
00,10maids with wet fruit hour
shes lvl 85
13and bees for a short bit there
Sumica: uh oh

I DON'T NEED MY MANE WET! I SPENT 2 HOURS BRUSHING IT TODAY! :o
2 hours?
Anime
00,10love the ost for this show
That was right when i got on. why'd he leave this fun place?

Is this Yuki Kajiura?
Oh, the soundtrack to these are nice~
Pinkies4thGrape: smells like Strawberrys doent it
/me hugs Ghosties
I know Kajiura's style. This is hers?
kitteh?
11,01Not sure whether to play games or sleep. It's almost 2:30 AM here.
00,10could be
04Thanks, panda
Has he popped back in here at all?
Strawberry_Discord: ikr
I'm making my first twilight sparkle plushie
twilight_sprinkle: HA! I'm a dude! Why would I spend 2 hours brushing it! :D I only spend less than a minute like 5 seconds :P
1) Volenteers do NOT have that kind of powers, only devs, GM's, and Internal security
damn Abra with their teleports
If you look closely, there's an anime behind the words
(crimson knights are vols)
/me bugs off
00,10you never played Eve did you RyunosukeKnT?
11,01I resigned from Gamefront since I wasn't active there anymore.
I remember that this anime tends to put me to sleep.
Is that song supposed to be playing with the episode?
Polyflower: :O
Ponies47: lol like i said, im a dude, and i only brush it for 5 secs per 2 months
AFK
For 10-20 minuts
I wish I was good at art. I have a DA but haven't put (squee) on it :p
twilight_sprinkle: LOL :D
11,01I wish I had 47 ponies.
Is this the first episode, by the way?
08,01i spend about half an hour brushing my hair, once every week
Sumica, I do, but generally speaking, ISD does not have the those kinds of powers that the crimson knights are supposedly having :)
00,10ISD and Polaris had alot of power
name check
08,01normally, i just untangle it with my fingers
Ghosties: you know... you dont pop in often... why is that?
08,01because my hair is super curly
that seems like GM/Dev level powers :)
name check
if you listen closely you can hear yays in the wind
08,01anyhoos, bed for realsies now
There
11,01My hair is so thick that I can't grow it out.
lol
00,10but then again ISD did kind of abuse said power before they were wattered down in to Polaris
Whick .hack is this, anyway?
@Polyflower: I haven't seen this in a long time, but I think it is.
I forget
00,10.//hack.Sign

00,10I was one of the few ISD rolled over to Polaris
oooo I wish my computer wouldn't suck so I could play TF2 :(
This is really confusing.
dat pokeball sound
I knew it, the soundtrack was done by Yuki Kajiura. That explains the awesomeness
04There's always a red spy in BronyState :D

Applejazz: thats not DT Woona
04Or Super
00,10true
04One of them does
This is .hack//sign
00,02why do i keep hearing pokeballs?
Is this .hack?
Also, hey there CupcakeWarrior :)
Tomato_Rush: I meant little Luna.
00,02oooo, .hack
CupcakeWarrior: it is
/me glomps Polydunami
Phase4: someone must be trying to capture yo!
00,02XD
00,102,12 is this blue spy enough?
I saw this show a very long time ago
Sumica: I think not.
hard to read sumi
Phase4: cause POmf is a fun sound effect
That blue is kind of hard to read
What was that? I can't hear you
so much blue
Sumica: nope i can still read it
Sumica: needs to be about 20% more blue
maybe black on blue?
Therefore, successful spy.
Sumica: Looks good :)
/me blue blue blue
04OH MY GOD
Applejazz: -lol- nice fruit choice...
04SUMI
black on black
04DAT...GAWD
04UGH
00,02Sumica, BLUE SPY IN THE BASE
Iron_Apple: It's got some cleverness behind it. :D

If they logged out of the computer, wouldnt the series be over with much faster?
A BLUE SPY IN THE BASE!?! :o
Ghosties: is obviously red spy
HUTHUTHUTHUTUHUT
/me join the happy happyists and experiance blu blue blue
Sumica... that hurts my face
00,10that's the hook, emo mage, cant log out
They're trapped in the game?
even if his mom calls him to dinner?
00,10no just him
the mage is
Oh
8,6at this point it's just him
When I play spy, I disguise myself as members of my own team for MAXIMUM WTF EFFECT
8,6then the internet explodes again and gets everyone
Sumica: To be fair, the mage has every reason to be a bit on the emo side.
00,10it's a discriptive term so people know who I am talking about.
she is annoying
Was this show ever on toonami?
Minimum amount of manners on the internet. I honestly wish that was held as a standard in real life.
why doesn't he kill her?
/duel
00,10yes
Wizards have an excuse for being secluded and kind of crazy. Sorcerers do not.
lose 1 hp
/me self destructs
kirzaloupe: that isnt till .hack//infection(?)
SLAP HER BACK
00,10iirc his class is called a "wave master"
he has kill rights now. she attacked him ^^
AzulaSurge: Lol
Sumica: sine or cosine?
For some reason, this wizard pisses me off.
Whiny?
Yeah, Wave Master. Kind of sounds like some sort of specialized mage.
As I see neither a monocle nor a spellbook on him, that must be a sorcerer prestige class.
oh god... Dot Hack?
Yeah
sign
yup
Kandahiru: a water mage probably
Also, hey there Midnight_Tempest :3
i never liked the show that much, though i loved the games... oh... and the music is freaking amazing
00,10sign =p
oh well off to work
Womb level D:
cya later
ahh is hard for me not to spoil this.... i love this anime
See you red_ony :)
question to pose: when there is a data crash, and the server reboots, what happens to tsukasa :)
bye red_ony
lol
Apparently The World never shuts down for regular maintenance.
OPEN THAT CHEST
what if the server crashes
Well, he'd best be glad he's not stuck in LoL...
nah. Pause the clock function, save all active memory to disk, reboot, reload, resume
00,10the world migrates data to secondary servers for matanatnce
That makes sense.
00,10is how they hand wave it
oooooh i know how she can get out, she should piss off a mod and get banned xD
hmm
*insert Zelda music*
dat epitaph of twilight
It's the 11th thru 15th commandments!
Google never goes down for maintenance. They have backups upon backups. And never will every backup be down at the same time.
who is tsukasa talking to at this point?
Im assuming I missed fruit hour or something
Is trolling his cat :P
00,10I need to get the kinda chibi looking .hack whos name eleudes me.
CupcakeWarrior: nah
For all intents and purposes, the OS tat includes the World is the internet, all OS, and ... well, everything computational.
What, no random encounter?
For the World to be structured like that makes perfect sense.
/me noms on KiwiBoi777
inb4 haxxxxx
/me hugs CupcakeWarrior
/me dances to the music
/me loves the music
ded
00,10oh yeah as part of the whole not being able to log out, he feels the world
So are these helmeted guys supposed to be mods?
why do they keep on traslating the word interesting as fun?
the guardian
haaaaxx
so much fun

He's dead, Jim.
Oh my
kirzstryfe: like gaming companies?
well that was creepy
This is a vicious game
kirzstryfe: damn that sounds dark..
00,10best song here
obviously they havent played EVE at this point
:p
8,6series has a great soundtrack
Isn't this the first epi+
wtf is this?
I liked 'In the Land of Twilight' the most from this show
.hack//sign
there was only UO
so waht came first the anime or games
debugging
save the bug!
Tomato_Rush The anime.
+1 exp
the anime, iirc
00,10so yeah guy in armor that died. was little girl
DAT POOR BUG
Sumica: pffffttttt
damn dat dark
Wait, so does dying in the game make you die irl?
usually it's the other way around online
00,10no
Sumica: You sure it wasn't Tsukasa?
CupcakeWarrior: no think that was the mage in real life
one never knows who is behind the character :p
00,10but the barbell of death is specal exception
This song is quite enjoyable
that girl was technically a mod, trying to keep the peace in the game... then got pwned by unexpected hax
I forgot if this ran on Toonami or what. I'm pretty sure it was never Adult Swim. But they kept the OP so it couldn't be Toonami.
So you just get permanently logged out?
The OP is in ENGLISH.
Midnight_Tempest: how tragic
Midnight_Tempest iirc they where just players, who wanted to act like mods
Come to think of it, I believe Cartoon Network aired this in an unbranded block of anime.
Yuki Kajiura never fails to impress
I tried accessing the total list of commands for real life, but many of them are derivative copies of one another.
Sumica: I am pretty certain it WAS Tsukasa's body that laiddown on the ground.
@Kandarihu: I think before Adult Swim, Toonami had some sort of midnight run thing.
00,10could be
YAY
I think that's where it was played
Sumica: That or the editing person would be HEAVILY confused on why that was there to begin wtih
GrimGrape: yes. But Toonami always strips out the OP themes and replaces it with their own.
i wish they had done a proper show version of .hack//GU... that would have been awesome
I love this one. ^^
/me drops it
ALL da fads
ALL THE MUSICAL MEMES, THROW THEM IN
what is this video called
ESPECIALLY THIS ONE!

CupcakeWarrior: Pendulum? lol

KiwiBoi777: It was on a tiarawhy animation 0_0

Whoa. A female Twin Blade. New to me!
00,10quantium is a one off ova

This is how I play Diablo III on Inferno. Run away, get cornered, and beg for help.
kiaruuuu
Applejazz, ;)
Oh, okay. But how long is this then?
i dont usaully watch anime/cartoons apart from MLP lol what is this?

Sumica: explains the sudden action
there are three stories to this?
:D
this one doesn't seem to have the good music
00,10yess still .hack
Ok where's my baseball bat? I've just about ahd it with this computer :|
*had
learn to keep the aggro knight :p
xmasskills: yup.
I would suck at this game if it were real
/me hands Ponies47 a bat
Sumica: why is the animation so different
Rainbow_Crash: it's an anime counterpart to a series of PS2 RPGs about a fictional MMORPG
00,10the kite, balmung and black rose look became favs of the shows createres after the games so they kept them
aww.... no wings. that sucks
If you get lost on a straight path, you're probably Zoro
CupcakeWarrior: -lol- the .hack game in the series is played using a standard gaming controller. "AB X Y" system.
^
00,10cause this was made like 12 years after
GrimGrape: I'm serious. I'm jsut about ready to samsh my computer to piece's. This thing is almost 10 years old and it hasen't died yet :|
Polydunami: One Piece :D
Neeeko
oh
*just
Cat. This means trouble.
*smash
Iron_Apple: or Ryoda :D
dat kitty
make sure to order a new one first
Kandarihu not sure i know what you mean by any of that exept for ps2 but thanks anyway :)
/me hugs Phase4
/me 00,02hugs CupcakeWarrior
isn't black rose some epic character at this point?
That cat reminds me of a chibi-Mio.
Out of the big three Shonen Jump series, One Piece is the only one I am currently reading
00,10all 3 of them are epic
no
00,10dat dragon
Nooo, I refuse
That blue haired girl is so cute!
CupcakeWarrior: And you use the virtual reality helmet to communicate and see were your going. So in truth the game wouldnt be much harder than a base 1st person shooter -lol-
Ponies47: If it's already making you rage, I wouldn't wait for it to die completely to replace it :P
Kill It!
ooo guilds
8,6look, it's Midnight_Tempest with pigtails
is that the one sin?

Also, I'm reading Hajime no Ippo, which is nearing 1,000 chapters

Even so, it's rather idiotic for me

Some are genious though.

And deadmau5 is part of the herd as well
genious sounds ironic lol
that smile
Heh.
Well, the animation quality in GMod Idiot Box rose dramatically over the course of it's run. And yet I've seen a few GMod videos that are better animated than what Idiot Box has yet to attain. So there is still room for improvement.

Night TheGreatAndPowerfulT :)
DeathStar: I was wondering one thing though: Where do you register for a nick, so only you can use the nick? :P
BP has gone to 2nd place on Bandcamp front page but there is also an album that's just remixes of scientist quotes on spot 5 xD
Can't wait to see derpy_pony on the stream
Wait
wut?
/me looks around for the cameras
DeathStar: With that nick somepony might get the impression your a star wars fan :P
http://www.bronystate.net/2012/06/05/bronystate-newsletter-642012/ See the A movie
and ooa hele natten is.. ooa all night basically.. lol, it's a bit difficult because direct translations make no sense and it's been a long time since i did that :p
anyway
pony_2369: umm you do something in the shat I can't remember what though try asking a mod when they come on
Okay
abstract concepts are fine
oh
We are watching derpy_pony soon :D
Caramell is the group, so the song is about their dance, and how everyone is going to be sooo enthusiastic about it
basically
03LOL
And afterward, we're going to see RyunosukeKnT :3
03That's amazingly shallow
it is XD
Rainbow_Crash: me like star wars? NEVER <.< >.>
I'm ok with this
03it's fricking catchy though
03well
03the other ones, Caramelldansen itself is annoying
03but the Supergott CD is really nice XD
for 90 minutes, you get to hear me monologue :)
It's a Discorded newsletter :S

DeathStar: i sometimes cant enjoy it because all the lazers sound the same sometimes LOL :P
loosely
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
03the song or the CD?
directly it's "good and mixed" - the CD
In a most delightful way
Rainbow_Crash: I don't mind that
