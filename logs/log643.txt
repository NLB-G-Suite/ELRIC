dat music
yeah I'm sure THE PILOT would win in a fight against a infantryman.
Such hapy music
xDDDDD
happy*
ideal music for battle
We need to watch the awful Starship Troopers anime after this.
lasers coool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hi everypony. Just got back frm practice...and feel ded.
the infantryman has only basic training
dat music
:D
the problem with this is
dat theme.
All personnel, report for Operation Deadmeat!
They try to swarm the bugs...
and this is the scene that alone makes this movie worth watching
moves out wise more games where like that
These guys seem like stupid teenagers than soldiers
poor dogs
they are
do it for the dogs!
First Wave? "WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE!!!"
That would be becuase they *are* stupid teenagers weho happen to be soldiers, too.
weeeeeeeeeeeee
;)
no halfway sane person would sell his body as meatshield for the government
That music. It reminds me of Robocop.
But Rico's a raw recruit straight out of bootcamp. Why do you think he has more than basic hand to hand training?
also, idiots
you're....UGGHHHH*
dabuck?
that's soem fucking sphincter power right there
Alright. All these ships are clustered together. That's not a good tactic.
Lotto happen yet?
did some one call for 25 pie boxes?
A million years of buttpower evolution.
that do NOT cover fighting gianting insectoids
2,14 now I wish I had starcraft II installed on this machine
FAILLLLL
fail spaceship!
How come the EarthFed ships are always, like, 20m apart?
i gues that explains it
ded
pizza is here!
Quite a shot.
yeah swarm the bugs
why not just vaporize the whole planet with nukes?
/me waves his Bugs Flag, for support of his favourite Race in this movie.
This reminds me of Earth Defence Force :P
It's thundering here...I'm just thinking that the pegasi missed a downpour last week.
FOR THE MOTHERLAND.
ZERG RUSH
uraaah!

well the Bugs are cooler in this movie
30% losses guaranteed
Fürs Vaterl... Muttershiff!

No air support, no basic tactics...
Do bullets stop anything?
they're DOOMED
FALL BACK YOU IDIOTS
You have to cut off the limbs!

Storms are cool, but I don't like the noises.

Explode ALL the things
We really enjoyed the buffering last night.
00,10yes is was as if the buffer was being controlled
flips like a boss on ship going down
SUPAHNOVA
Or are they wasting massive amounts of energy on making themselves easier targets by holding still?
maybe the bugs have a thinner atmospher on there planet letteing in more light energy and have more efficent means of light to energy conversion
>Ship that houses hundreds
2 man esacpe pods not that good
