Hats are popular back then
Pretty big favour, pretty close...
Ah, mime, kill it!
Darf14: They still are!
so when was this set the 40's or the 80's
Darf14: Many people still wear hats you know
n extra big bag of SMASH with me while watching this movie. im gonna get fat!
eeyup
suspense music for the mime
Darf14: i got one of those hats :) i wish they still worn those :'( now when i use them in my school everyone laughs at me...
people aren't wearing enough hats
lol
wb Discord
damn mimes
this movie is why mimes scare me
alexxm: 80's stylized on 40's
Bob!!!1
I haven't been on in a few weeks o.o
Nothing suspicious of that mime
"Maybe these mimes will speak up about Batman."
seems legit
Kencolt, MoP?
Suddenly Joker is the Penguin
Joker!!!
Safarimonkey I haven't been on in a few weeks.
xXQuickSC0pezXx
ded
Basically, 80's, with Burton trying for a Film Noir (40's) with a freakish supefuture (as he saw it-- 2020's) mix.
Discord: Then you don't have a registered nick I guess
epic kill
dat joke:)

DED
Its always the quiet ones

Stallion_of_War: the puns,the puns :D
I thought mimes use silencers
Umm, Bruce... You don't have your bulletproof suit on, you know?
Got QUILLED by the Joker
Darf14: :D that would make way to much sense
This Batman is really quite gobless
haha good one Darf14
JESmith71: terribly good joke
:D
Partycannon!
i want that gun
:)
I wonder if the festival will be long
you know there is a better way to turn off the tv, right?
Wow he really made a dent on that tv
The pen is mightier than the sword, but bringing a few machineguns for backup don't hurt
lol
dat line:D
:D
enema
That's one way to turn off the tv
Kandarihu: Mist of Pandaria, the new Expac for WoW-- for some reason, when I pre-ordered my copy of the new expansion, the clerk added, "oh, and'd here's your Beta Key, so you can get the hang of it." Ou tof NOWHERE.
Classic scene
Yum. Enemas.
eneamas for everyone
Hey guys
Mimes don't use props. They'll hold out their hands as if they're holding a gun, then behave as if they're facing some big recoil as they pretend they're firing their imaginary guns.
I have a feeling he's going to screw Gotham.
I'm back on the computer
Kencolt, I see.
PillowPoni: good, enjoy the movie!
i winder where shibaru is
Kandarihu: And it's a trip. I can see the final being just plain amazing.
nahhhh stalion what ever gave you that idea?
mentallyeffedguy: Wee~
we call this furry nowadays....and thousands of people do it
"Alfred, remember to get me some sand. And if they grade it...... coarse."
6Same..
hey PillowPoni
Hey Pearly

Joker really hates txs
Dark92Enigma: elephants
They sure go through a lot of TVs...
tvs
This is why remotes were invented
brb gonna go make some music
That's one wa yto turn off the tv
How to turn off your TV in one simple step: shoot it.
6k ^^
Dat giant revolver
It also works with lightbulbs
actually never mind, ill just take my phone with me lol
Darf14: I prefer the jokes remote, it's more entertaining
And one more ding for you Ponies47. :)
6xD
Canadian_Brony or use the remote infront of you
Have one from me Ponies47
mentallyeffedguy: I ALREADY told you after they got in the batcave, where the sound of bats could be heard. It's not much of a spoiler
i bought you a rose, fuck me right?!
Ding Dong
he went cheep on the flowers for a rich guy
Canadian_Brony: it only works one way, though
Dark92Enigma: i was sure it was just soundeffects
MrMalk but that isn't one simple step! You have the gun, so you pull the trigger. With the remote, you'll have to lean over, pick it up, and push the button.
6DAMN MOSQUITOS! -.-
Im bored :(
Dark92Enigma I said turn it off, not on.
how dare you its batman
"I'm the joker"
mentallyeffedguy: in that case, i'm sorry

6I haven't been bitten for the whole of August and now all of a sudden I'm full of bites.. -.-
ScarecrowGanjalf: What a twist that would be!
MrMalk are you telling me you don't have a gun in your hand at all times?!? What are you, sane?
thelonepony: that could work :) probably will do that later :P

Canadian_Brony: you cant denie it....batman gave the kill order lol
6Meh..kinda feel like drawing but I'm not sure who to draw.. ._.

TDK Joker is best Joker
back in the day, Jack was pretty kirkin' young and cool
my wifi adapter keeps shutting off randomly
Batman botched his stealth roll
Jack Nicholson is actually an awesome joker, and the best at the time

Dark92Enigma: Gasp and shock

No one can resist Joker
I was about to kick him. Oh well.

Hi Kandarihu.
BAT-COCKBLOCK!
Thanks, otakon1.
Hey Nittany_Discord
np
Hey DerpyMuffins.

/me Hello, my name is Amigo Toyota,.....WHATEVER YOU KILLED MY PARENTS!!!!
poor crazy joker
windows error? anyone
Stupid Joker.
Prepare to die.
:D DAT NO SELL
/me does a George Takei "Oh mai"
MY PARENTS ARE DEAD
PURPLE IS BEST COLOR
Yes.
I made you, you made me first.
:D
PinkieSpice, can't tell if jokesteal.
Yes he would
AAAH
that would be a yes
grab
im sorry but Joker being the one who killed his parents is lame
HE WOULD :D
:D
Kinda
:D
How the hell did the Joker know what batman was refering to when he said he killed his parents?
pinke pie
Don't listen to the Joker vicki.
One thing though, Nicholson does the Joker laugh PERFECT.
Azuredragon: it's the same in the Batman TAS too
AAAAAH
Straaaaaight outta from looney toones
I dont know.
that girl is STUPID
Troll
DAT F*CKING LAUGH! Yes, Korra, thanks for telling me.
Dark92Enigma: it IS Warner Bros.
*TUNES
*Kurra
while he busy playing around, he could have stepped on thier hands
PinkieSpice: not his style
otakon1: Thanks for reminding me
One, I could be the aquatic Avatar too, that's okay. |3
DAT GARGOYLE
there we go
Inb4 Disney Villain Death
is this batman begins or why does this scene looks similiar
BaneSurge: hush!
brony90: no it's Batman
damn windows error
Sure thing, Kurra.
Foreshadowing.
idiot -_- paints joker more like a fool than a clown
The joker's fall is physics-free
brony90: It's the classic 1989 Batman, the first movie
famous last words
I smell foreshadowing
FAMOUS LAST WORDS
Epic Foreshado- OH FOR GOD'S SAKE IT COULDN'T BE MORE OBVIOUS!
lol
Then Frolo falls on him.
should have kicked them off while he could
I wonder though WHY his leg didn't just cut off
Remember at the beginning, Joker was danging, and Batman tried to save him? Batman's doing the opposite here.
scary
There is NO WAY he could hold that if it was real stone.
dat leg
Yikes.
love this fall
dat weight
that's like a Fiat 500's worth of rock.
he falls to death now?
Eyeup.
DED
Alright, RAISE YOUR HAND if you think the musician did a brilliant job for this movie.
BaneSurge: no
that stone statue must weigh several hundred pounds
I guess now hes just....Dead weight
Derpy: I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT WENT WROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG
AAAAH
One: agree
/me raises hand
Thereby, Batman gave Joker enough clues to uncover his secret identity. If the Joker lived long enough to put 2+2+2+2 together, he WOULD uncover Batman's secret identity.
his wrists and arms woulda snapped like rubber bands. O_O
/me raises hand
Batman dosent kill? Ookay?
*raises hand*
he did not leave a smile
if he wasn't soo cocky, whe would have lived
The gargoyle killed him
...........
Obsidian: Ba dum tss
Goliath killed The Joker
quit screamin you bitch"!
Some times i can kill myself best famouse last words
It's elfman who made the music, so the awesomeness is a given
she is Lady screams-alot
TRIVIA: That GARGOYLE was Actually Goliath
......creepy
once more creepy ass music
Hahahahahaha Hahahahahaha

AH AH AH AH
spike has an awesome style
yay trixie
I love this show, anyone here heard of it?
I'm best pony
Big adventure
The great and powwerful trixie is hear :|
My thoughts, even for it's time, it still holds up as a timeless classic. The music plays very well with the enviroment, and sometimes, it's silenced so we can appreciate the atmosphere........even though other characters outside the Joker and Batman were less memorable, this still hoilds up. 8/10
Kurra, It's a pretty tame show without any sex or violence. It's good for comedy, you should try it out if you like that kind of stuff
twilight_sprinkle: EXACTLY.
trixe is just a big show off
Fraaaance
Best pony
whats that pony in the corner?
i would love to be with rainbowdash
BIG ADVENTURES!!!!
Twilight's soft casual giggle, makes me wanna dedicate myself to her.

So much testosterone.
STURODS
/me gives Wirisme a bucket
Nyst: even between women
A bucket? for me!?
/me eats steroids
bullshit!!! hes drinking redbull
Use it wisely
MadSurge, you saw this movie. It's a one-world government. There IS only one country. And it runs contrary to values that were still held sacred when this movie was made.
get RoidRage!
yeaaaaah
yeaaaaaaaah
:)
Yep. Arena football.
Kandarihu: Yep
Ohai Nittany_Discord
Hey Nittany_Discord! :$
HAI
Some of the values this movie runs contrary to are STILL held sacred even today.
Hi Nittany_Discord
Kandarihu: this is like fascism to the extreme
Lashes huh.
because normal discord was too mainstream
Professor Sam Fisher.
Hipster-Pony: MANEstream :P
Hi HoodyNinja, MadSurge, and Obsidian.
Colorless by choice?
wait this idiot is going to havard?
lol
Petrified_Discord: LOL :D
Dat Sam Fisher.
It's a pretty interesting concept that such a violent and power driven civilisation could flourish. If you look at the buildings or tech things look pretty good.
Who needs Harvard when you can go to war?
Kandarihu: that's why I keep saying it too :D
im gay!
I yell that to my friends
And -everyone- looks handsome.
works for the usa too, Nyst. they're always at war, but never in their own soil
on
Buytoast: We know. :)
Nyst: Thats how most great countries flourished in the old days, like Rome, Greece, and all those other empires. They looked out for numero uno
slut
im gay just like nph
DaringDerpy: I like to imagine that the USA isn't quite at that level yet.
6_9
Buytoast: just like or for?
Kandarihu: probably the richest country's lifestyle is the one that takes on in a totalitarian one-nation world
is there Boobs on here?
we r never at war on usa soil cuz no one dares to fuck with us
HURHUR HAY GURL
there os snowflake
we woop there ass
Redhead
HoodyNinja: Well if you look at say the Spartans, they were culturally dead, instead having their slaves do all things art, music, technology and the like.
some epic buffers last night
MadSurge: yum
is there a admin to repeat it over and over :D LOL
Nyst: recruiting stupid school boys? being at constant war?
I hate my computer...
Snowflake: funny how you asked that :D
DaringDerpy: public lashings?
my name's Bonshaquitalafondria
Snowflake: an admin to repeat what over and over?
Nyst: ok, this one is different
LOL
Oh lawd. I just went and got a cup of coffee, put two spoons of vanilla ice cream in it, and am now experiencing orgasmic feelings in my stomach.
XD

so here he's a cockblock instead of a wingman,huh?

hello Ninjazz
Oh my
suddenly erection
\Hi Ninjazz
Hey, Dusky. All be well?
MadSurge, Italy's stereotypes are not grounds for condemnation and bigotry.
Hey, thelonepony.
Suddenly "music"
that was a classic cockblock move
BRAIN WASHING in actioj
all is swell ^_^
"Italy never ended a war on the side it began it with. Except if it changed sides twice."
MURCA

DaringDerpy: sad but true
That's greaaat

All end up in the same Fleet.
00,03Did you guys know that Neil Patick Harris is into Men? I was confuzzled when i heard..
Nyst, citizens get the prosthetics, because the civilians are the ones who aren't serving in the military.
I WONT QUIT I WONT TO HAVE NO LEGS AND ONE ARM
and in the end... everyone of them is a powerRanger...
Scoot-Scootaloo: How does that matter?
WONT *WANT

Scoot-Scootaloo: Slowpoke news?
Kandarihu: oh yeah, I got the two mixed up.

Gruesome. :/

ponyremix: They're tending to the retard heavies.
Asking for ponies during an official movie stream will probably have no effect. Outside of an official stream, it will result in trolling.

Next week im going to Walmart to pick up another pony toy (brushable, not blind bag)... I have Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash, so should I get Twilight, Rarity, Applejack, or Fluttershy?
And the guy who's streaming now (or at least as of the last movie) is a master at trolling us when someone asks for ponies.

HOLD on, everypony. I'M TRYING TO GET TOMBSTONE ON BRONYSTATE!
pretty good alexxm|colt just playin some Dark Souls
Cause Scoot-Scootaloo is MLG enough to handle anything. :)
Fl00t4hSh41: because plot
Shouldn't that wait untill AFTER the pilots get their liscences?
Fl00t4hSh41, probably because the simulators don't give the full experience.
I just realized they call those soldiers "mobile infantry". Is there an "immobile infantry"?
Snowflake: Do what ever you want but dont make fluttershy cry :'(
One: WHAT?
00,03Damnright, son~
Okay their spaceships look amazing. I love their design.
Whose Tombstone?
Kandarihu: But that wasn't supervised or as part of an exercise
Alchemist: standard infantry has to walk to the front

Vordox: look him up on youtube...
brony_90: Nah, his name is...
05last he needs is the whole chat explodign cause hejoined
who?
He will drown in the amount of pings he will get.
One, this isn't a good time for that. Not while we're watching Starship Troopers
Wrek: I know right? Ponies goin crazy up in here today.
i really want calamari tonight
00,03If he actualy joined, I would know anyway~
Wrek: this is no place for "celebrities" :D

Okay. She's been through the simulations, and she aced them.

05i jsut personally think its for both the best of the chat and the celeb in question to use an alias
nailed it
holy shit that was close
but a broney is all ways loved by snowflake
A woman can drive ^^
Alchemist: There was a SimGretina in here last night. :D
Wrek: And not say a thing.

what's mLG?
ded
This tactic would never work, since No one is REALLY that good.
YEA@
Wrek: It would meeken the suspicion.
05but i dotn trust this chat enough to safely say that join here as a celeb will prove a good experience
the third wasn't that good
pony_300: Minor League Gaming. :P
the third was utter crap
nope it wouldent One
those merauders wer meh
the third movie?
05One: an alias is more than enough to dull any suspicion
Wrek is wise on his words
6I want more barbecue saus
6sauce! D:
was AFK has it been the hand scene yet?
no dark_host the second was utter crap
And yet we have Mr. Poniator.
Wrek: Let him join and his fans praise him
What if he just goes as a pony_*?
Klumzeedragon: well, I dont know that much brony celebrities. I know woodentoaster, alexs, tombstone, h8seed, aviators and that's about it
05Vordox: by all means

05i just dont want him to feel smothered
Wrek: Depends on WHAT fans... >.>
JT: the seconds was plain boring the third was utter crap. especially since the bug animation got a downgrade to "hoby animator"
Wrek: Skype says he's busy anyways.
what could go wrong? celeb gets a bad impression?
00,03Then again, there are floozy impersonatrs, which can get you banned!

i dont think he needs a medic
Yeah they're not going to be able to patch that up.
dat headshot lol
Wrek: Absolutely nothing.
HUMILIATION.
Hank from Breaking Bad?
Should have called cease fire. :/
Alchemist: I was just about to say that. And yes it is. :D

Friendly Fire was on.

Or move him off the course.
Jeez, that woman has to live with that.
that has to hurt
dat freshadowinh
oh god
Ninjazz, not her fault entirely.

Nittany_Discord, it's a live-fire exercise. Calling a cease-fire here is bad training.
Lashings. All the lashings!

00,03DocSane: I said YOUR NAME IS TOBY!
Ineed wrek xD
Kunta! Kunta Kinte!
00,10had to call it out did't you wrek
Wrek, I was about to say that.
trollghost: He was agreeing and saying it would be worse. :P
That's ten lashes
05Sumica: of course
Wrek: Oh god :D haha
:p
this is over too fast for a decent punishment
05im not morally guilty over anything
00,03We should stream Roots sometime :D
05i have no reason to
05be
Wrek: for all it's faults, in this future race or gender no longer matter.
00,03imagine the butthurt!
coffe ?
i'll see u guys later
well
i'll be back in a few
Bye ponyremix
2,14 Scoot: I'd be inclined to agree, but you saw how chat reacted to the boobies
see ya
ponyremix: Following ya mate.
Just dumped Nice Guy Rico and gets with Not-Quite-Asshole That guy.
Goodbye ponyremix
00,10but yeah, that guy sucks, He wiped too fast.
peace
ponyremix: later :D
00,03I know... then again i streamed boondocks and chat was sort of fine~
Sumica: yea he wiped to fast, but that whipping was a pretty good speed
00,10you are supposed to wait for the sting to die down before you do it again
00,03sort of...
Wow my fanfic is doing better than I thought
00,10othere wise they are still numb from the first few
Nyst, there is still discrimination. Mormons are discriminated against. And so are people who don't serve in the military.
because the move is full of chat megs
you seems to know a lot about this Sumica
wait.. i meant whipping cream
derpymuffins
What the hell is that rotating thing in back supposed to be?
whats your fanfic?
http://cheezburger.com/6564465920
2,14 Sumica was in the army *applejackface*
sting? numb? what are you talking about Sumica ?
Scoot-Scootaloo: Sorry I missed that. Boondocks is pretty funny. :D
DerpyMuffins: link
Scoot-Scootaloo, only because I kept quiet when by all rights, I shouldn't have.
trollghost: lashings
Kandahiru: Yup. All discrimination distilled into citizen and civilian.
00,03yeah yeah~
Can I show fic links during stream?
00,10we have an emote for that now Caramel
this is like star trek. starfleet controls everything. non members are second class citizens
Cosmic Cockblock
A gravity FIELD?
00,10>_> and <_<
then why arnt they being dragged into the side of the ship?
2,14 I know, but I'm not using the embed client anymore :P
00,03only image lnks DerpyMuffins~
run!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
And even when I spoke up, I was shouted down by everyone who loved Boondocks.
Wait, is it an asteroid or a wormhole?
Guess not
Maybe later
D:
it's both
00,10dont need to use it to type them =p
DerpyMuffins: Just PM the link
why yes, we have this convenient button with exactly the right maneuver for precisely this one rock
Hey Bronies! The Newest Episode of PWAAMLP is on youtube right now!
Also gotta wonder why that rock is so slow
wait till last sec retards
Dark_Horst: and even then it didnt work
:T
wat? just push down the steering wheel? what are you, an amateur? we have buttons
Should have avoided sooner?
"so how many men did we lose?", "all of them sir"
Screw those guys on the...star destroyer bridge or whatever that was.
Kandarihu: you don't like Boondocks, we get it. You DO realize the humor of it is poking fun at racial stereotypes correct?
Probably should have.
lost the canteen
But they were trying t o show off.
kidzrul434, what is that acronym?
Nittany_Discord: and that is why you will never become a pilot
that engine just HAPPENED to be the communications centre too
thats pretty cool
good job
Kandarihu Pheonix Wright Ace Attorney My Little Pony
all the booze was in there
God dman, I hate the Nazi athetic of this movie
hi mommy!!!!!!!!!
oh hai johnny
hi daddy!!!!!!!!!!!!
otakon1, the stereotypes presented there about black people aren't very condemning in nature. The stereotypes presented about white people tend to be quite condemning.
We're the whitest people in Buenos Aeries
Kandarihu: so? you're point? it's funny
We love you
and then dead
DocSane: this has nothing to do with nazis...it's normal military culture
Hello mother, hello father!
otakon1: what do you know, agro is alive
DocSane: pssst, it'S part of the parodying take on propaganda this movie has, but dont tell anyone. it's a secret
wow, what a coincidence that just at the time he calls, rain kills them
DaringDerpy, it's not a military culture that happens every day.
Bronysith: yeah but YOU didn't know that
The sky is going dark because the sun is being blocked by A GIANT FIERY BALL
Bronysith: lol
05of course they often are Kandarihu. its becasue its enoucraged and seen as accepted to be racist agaisnt white people
oooooh, take THAT!
/me nick otakon
DaringDerpy: No, the costumes are intentionally designed to be reminicent of Nazi uniforms
Shouldn't they have seen a GIANT SPACE ROCK coming at them? Like they have people in the government for that, right?
Klumzeedragon: Here I am at, camp Granada
tehre we go
not in the book, DocSane
otakon: Nice
05DocSane: say what you want about the nazis, but their uniforms were fucking gorgeous
otakon: oh there we go, thats much better
/me throws a rabid tonberry at otakon
run
/me dodges
run and you dont know why
otakon: it is a homing tonberry
free beer!
WAR! Murika!
One of the few things Hitler made right, Wrek.
DaringDerpy: I know, but Verhoeven made the usual lazy mistake of assuming Starship Troopers is a Fascist story.
why yes, they had awesoem uniforms. hugo boss designed them
/me leads the homing tonberry BACK to Bronysith
the hell is wrong with the nazis? they were just following orders.. :|
ohai everypony :D
Wrek, but is it right? Regardless of what the tone in the media and blogs and academia say, is it right to be racist against white people?
hi Michael
/me grabs otakon and attaches the tonberry to his back
Wrek done by hugo boss apparently
oodly specific tragetory
AH!
good aim
/me hugs thelonepony
We know the bugs can aim and shoot asteroids.
Hi Bronies/Ponies :) im feeling dizzy :P
GETITOFF!GETITOFF!GETITOFF!
05Kandarihu mhm
Hello Michael :)
Hello Pikachu
foreshadowing!
/me hugs MLP_Brovakiin
hit a city from the other end of the galaxy
hi Pikachu
Hey Pikachu
Though we don't know why.
ohai Pikachu
6:3
/me hugs Michael back :3
how are things Pikachu
DaringDerpy: 50K light years away....which means they launched it 50K years ago
There are some rumors, that the Federation did that themselves to get the morale for the Klendathu Attack.
Nyst: I've been playing with the idea that he bugs traveling by asteriod is propaganda in order to engage the war. *conspiracy Keanu*
OBJECTION!
so I'm pretty sure it WASN'T INTENTIONAL
lol
There was a time where it was popular to be racist against black people. Those times are over, although there are people who keep dredging up those terrible memories for personal gain. Holding white people of today responsible for the crimes of the distant past.
this is starship troppers if i am not wrong
Dat bro sarge.
pony_300: maybe, but they can actually do that. it's how they colonize other planets.
otakon: It had to be launched a lot earlier than that, it wasn't relatavistic
and that day boomer died
no my dog
Doggy :'(
otakon: everything is moving, even to hit earth they had to aim very precisely. it was intentional
Fl00t4hSh41: well it wasn't traveling even at the speed of light
NotBoomer!
is there any boston pizzas in ur area?
boomer died
alexxm|colt: Good i feel dizzy from going on a fast ride 10 time
boomer must live!
s
Michael, troppers, lol
s
fauckers showed us a dead dog fuck them
otakon: That's what I said
again, why do they not just blow up the planet?
Why are they so afraid to make technology-using non-humanoid aliens?
DaringDerpy: but it wasn't traveling at the speed of light for one.
Nyst: Yea, that's only what we've been told, but we haven't really seen them *do* it
KYF
thanks Kandarihu
Dat NPH.
DocSane: bc then we can sympathize with them
know your foe :)
troll :D
and it doesn't seem like the bugs riding on that meteor that destroyed that town survived
6Boston pizzas?
pony_300: no bugs on it
dat propaganda
ahahaha
just like dead space.... aim for something and kill it
omg
god so much propaganda
2,14 otakon: in the book/tv show there were
hahaha
90% Less Bugs!
pony_300: I think they did. The've seen bugs on other planets, plus they quarantained the planet's asteroid belt.
Caramel: hmmm
i guess not then
this movie is getting interesting
Nyst: those are spores ON the asteroids that hatch after planet fall
YUM YUM SLUT
maybe its only in canada
somehow i like this movie more than Bedman
The only good bug is a DEAD BUG!
otakon: ahh
Genocide! Genocide!
Bonk bonk on the head!
brony_90: Batman
You know what would be funny, If the Bugs saw this tv channel
yes
yes it would
kill all the bugs
"Lets all get cut together" <---wtf?
otakon: ah know :3
the slut dumped you,r emmember?
wait, how do you qurantine an asteriod belt?
Michael: Kill ALL the bugs!
pony_300: very carefully
is she really this dumb?
wtf
women
eeyup
put bug spray around the rock done
he is best for him too
whelp
BYE EVERYPONY
otakon: so the bugs aren't allowed near the asteriod?
kick his ass
:T
bye Hipster-Pony
who needs bug spray if we have nuke's on missle launchers
byebye
bye Hipster-Pony
Goodbye Hipster-Pony
Here comes a fight.
nye Hipster-pony
pye hipster-pony! :)
cya hipster
pony_300: no not the bugs, humans.
owned :D
all them pings
kick your ass
Fight, fight, fight, fight.
oh shit
2 head shots :D
bug spray= upgardes
Alchemist, welcome to the universe of Starship Troopers. Most of the time, if you have to ask "Is X really that stupid?", the answer is yes.
otakon: why would theyy be worried about humans going near the belt?
dat music
yeah I'm sure THE PILOT would win in a fight against a infantryman.
Such hapy music
xDDDDD
happy*
ideal music for battle
We need to watch the awful Starship Troopers anime after this.
if a flight officer can win a fight against an infantry soldier, there are some serious problems in training
lasers coool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hi everypony. Just got back frm practice...and feel ded.
the infantryman has only basic training
otakon: Pilots do need a lot of physical training due to G forces they have to withstand
pony_300: BC THE BUGS SPORES ARE IN THE BELT AND COULD CONTAMINATE any ships flying through, allowing the bugs to "piggyback" on the ship.
Hello Kawaii_icybeauti
ohai Kawaii_icybeauti
Hello Kawaii_icybeauti :)
dat music
:D
the problem with this is
Fl00t4hSh41: that doesn't mean hand to hand combat though I wouldn't think beyond basic
heya Obsidian Michael MLP_Brovakiin
hello crazypony
dat theme.
im pretty sure this is the scene that inspired the ODST in Halo
I love this Music
All personnel, report for Operation Deadmeat!
They try to swarm the bugs...
So good.
ah yeah THIS scene
and this is the scene that alone makes this movie worth watching
moves out wise more games where like that
These guys seem like stupid teenagers than soldiers
DerpyMuffins: that's the point
poor dogs
they are
Hell Jumpers away
otakon: ahh, finally it makes some sense
DerpyMuffins: where is the difference?
I saw a list from some feminist site on "Most empowering girl's shows," and MLP was on it :$
DerpyMuffins, they're both teenagers and soldiers.
do it for the dogs!
thelonepony: Feet first into hell!
First Wave? "WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE!!!"
WE get you sir! haha
That would be becuase they *are* stupid teenagers weho happen to be soldiers, too.
weeeeeeeeeeeee
Kawaii_icybeauti: but feminist site...
mlp is a girls show?
No powered suits = no chance in hell
;)
no halfway sane person would sell his body as meatshield for the government
That music. It reminds me of Robocop.
But Rico's a raw recruit straight out of bootcamp. Why do you think he has more than basic hand to hand training?
DocSane: no artillery or heavy vehicle support either
Love the power suits. Missed them when I first saw the movie.
otakon: Your right...But at least they can't say one thing isn't horrible..
true
also, idiots
DaringDerpy: the media paints it as a fun adventure.
you're....UGGHHHH*
hey guess what? the bugs are pooping at you. from the planets surface
dabuck?
Sumica: Its applejack appreciation day at EqD
otakon: Like I said, they removed the powered suits and didn't realize they needed to add the other stuff back in.
GIANT BALLS OF HOT PLASMA
that's soem fucking sphincter power right there
Alright. All these ships are clustered together. That's not a good tactic.
Lotto happen yet?
nobody makes it back alive
did some one call for 25 pie boxes?
Also, why is the space fleet parked so densely they can almost spit from one ship to the next?
REMEMBER YOUR TRAINING AGAINST HUMAN TACTICS AND INTELLIGENCE
A million years of buttpower evolution.
Nyst: that's how they get their recruits. adventure. unusually much money for unskilled work helps too.
that do NOT cover fighting gianting insectoids
Kandarihu: Human tactic 101: "The Zerg Rush"
how come human starships always look like crap
so much fail
big goddamn mistake
they didnt expect bugs to be able to hit stuff
so MUCH goddamn fail
2,14 now I wish I had starcraft II installed on this machine
FAILLLLL
So, the bugs are dumb? WRONG!!
fail spaceship!
Atheist: cuz theyre funded by corporations with outside interests :P
How come the EarthFed ships are always, like, 20m apart?
Wait a sec, who in tarnation picked this?
2,14 I'm in a real god damn bug killing mood right now
i gues that explains it
Dark_Horst: and yet they said the bugs hit EARTH from 50K light years away
ded
DocSane; because the literally wanted to blanket the planet with bombs and troops.
pizza is here!
Caramel: then go play Skyrim and uninstall all the patches :P
DocSane: Yeah, they should be easily 100km from eachother
Quite a shot.
yeah swarm the bugs
why not just vaporize the whole planet with nukes?
Human zerg rush!!
/me waves his Bugs Flag, for support of his favourite Race in this movie.
pewpewpew
This reminds me of Earth Defence Force :P
It's thundering here...I'm just thinking that the pegasi missed a downpour last week.
FOR THE MOTHERLAND.
ZERG RUSH
uraaah!
FUS RO DAH!
Alchemist: not enough glory and sense of superiority.
Kawaii_icybeauti: they're kicking up a wind storm over here
lol
human wave tactics
Alchemist: ikr? Its yonkers all over again. Zeds dont give a hoot about infantry tactics, and neither do bugs
well the Bugs are cooler in this movie
dat is a huge bug
Alchemist: They need a publicrelations stunt?
30% losses guaranteed
05Caramel: id play you but region lock :o
Alchemist: Exactly. In the book, there were several races at war and they needed to capture and hold, not just destroy.
Fürs Vaterl... Muttershiff!
ZERG STUFF
2,14 wrek: IKR?
Colt_Silver: except WE are intelligent and THEY work on instinct
Maybe after this movie, I'll just get on PSO2. The overarching enemies are basically giant dark bugs collectively known as Darkers. But they are clearly evil.
00,03Operation Human Sheild is a go~
otakon: Well, the storm is passing through where I live, going east. Did it hit you guys yet?
alian butt lazers
^
05otakon: not the rbain bugs
Dat buttlazer
/me grabs Scoot-Scootaloo
Alchemist: And infantry on the ground looks better in the propaganda than a spaceship nuking some random rock
alien butt plasma you mean.
05the zerglings maybe
otakon: What they lack in intelligence, they make up for with a hivemind and vast numbers
Kawaii_icybeauti: it got REALLY windy heavily here
05but not the brainbugs
Nuke's For the win ^^
move up Space Marines!!!
Colt_Silver: vast is an understatement
well,THERE's a design-flaw...
05SPAEC MUHREENS
nah Imperial gaurd XD
one bug
Yeah, I always forget that this movie was a recruiting tool
why didnt they just use the DEATH STAR to destory the entir eplanet
ded
zerlings!
takes 12 guys to kill
om nom nom
ded
Atheist: troopers r cheaper
AND 100's of rounds
Kawaii_icybeauti: storms are cool. :)
They´re always using Rocket-Launchers...Why not Zoidberg
otakon: I had to cheer a football game this morning, and it started puring like hell where it was taking place. Thank gawd we left early. But it was nice for most of the afternoon until I got home just now.
antlion!
zerg rush o shit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
No air support, no basic tactics...
Do bullets stop anything?
Jesus....
they're DOOMED
counterattack ^^
FALL BACK YOU IDIOTS
You have to cut off the limbs!
otakon, I'd say both sides lack intelligence. They BOTH run on instinct.
fail tactics
Storms are cool, but I don't like the noises.
docsane no tanks...just a zerg rush of infantry
concentrated fire
troops may be cheaper but are a 100,000,000X less affective
DocSane: they're first wave, they're cannon fodder and defenseline-stresstest
DocSane: they approached this comepletely confident they'd win instantly.
and then THIS moron
and hope they die
MLP_Brovakiin: its not dead spce
noob down
in the balls
Ow.
XD
I HOPE EVERYONE DIES
dead
Pedro NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
Translation from arachnid <FOOD!>
idior
and ofc the body armor does NOTHING
idiot*
the media guy in this battle scene is awesome XD
00,03apparently grenades don't exist in this time period...
pwned
brony_90: My point still stands :D
Dude just can't get a break.
O_O
he's like Carbine from Gears of war!
welcome to war
That was probably a COD fanboy anyways
Scoot-Scootaloo: oh they do
this is only the beginning
MLP_Brovakiin: :D
ded
They have nukes and future M-16s. And that's it.
dead
Gotta not love how violent this movie is.
otakon: prolly cuz a bug bite has more punch than a bullet
00,03Needs more Ben Carmine
Scoot: I think only 3 exist in this world
Scoot-Scootaloo, they were firing grenades from RPG launchers... the thermonuclear grenades.
come with papa
2,14 Scoot: rofl
In the books they also had mechsuits.
true
she ded
Scoot-Scootaloo: Grenades are for MLG only. They arent MLG enough.
05what would work here? a heavy caliber sabot shotgun
Scoot-Scootaloo, Clay Carmine is best Carmine.
00,03Ih yeah that's right...
these people are diots
05preferrably drum magazined
how about some ARTILLERY COVER?
Everytime someone enters the rage-badass-mode je dies....
IDIOTS
yeah, they reserved the heavy ordinance for the bug artillery
05almsot liek an AA12
IDIOTS
IDIOTS
I really want to see this scenario in the Alien franchise
We're watching pony after this, right?
wut
nom
See what I wouldve done first is carpet bomb the place. Heck GLASS the entire planet like the covenant would
The camera guy xD
00,10would not mind some sc2 my self
nom nom nom
Wrek: I would go with an M60
oh man xD

nom nom nom
Hi, everyone!
nom
2,14 >LET'S FILM IT
*best
hiya Joy
WHY DID WE SEND GROUND TROOPS
And now we are back to the scene from the intro
hi Joy
were are the planes
05Major: too little a punch for the ammo cost
ohai Joy
00,03Joy came back to the chat! :D
Atheist: military intelligence
I say lots of grenade launchers. Equip their entire front line with grenade launchers and they'd be fine
05you're not fighting a human here
Wrek: the morita actually has an integrated shotgun that fires the rifle ammo in bulk, the game usses that
/me is now Joyful.
the sonar invisble jet fighters
Hello again Joy :)
drop the camera!!
pony_300: flamethrowers too
:)
haha
why do we fail so much
Wrek: this movie just seems to forget a lot of things
dumb
I feel so loved!
Infantry shoot with their guns. That camera guy is press, not infantry. He shoots with his camera.
and stnd on a mountain
ded
hit with his dead buddy
2,14 See, this is why you don't nuke Hiroshima, because if Japan were a stronger figure in this they'd be sending Gundams
yummi human
Wrek: from what heard M60 rounds can tear a man in half
man, dem effects....
colt_silver ikr?
facehoof
Caramel: they would HAVE giant robot mechs!
Dumbass.
how about some grenade launchers?
and STILL NOT DEAD
lol
@caramel : yes,and Ninjas
00,10AJ plushies! I want one'
idiots
dat gotta hurt
2,14 Otakon: Just amazing Mazinger punching the shit out of these guys
therse no plains no mech infantry no tanks no planetry bombardment EVRYTHING IS MISSING
05still a human
shot gun rounds ^^
The bugs are knows for staying lethal even with several limbs missing.
05and you're not fightign a human here
Last Stand!!
Reload once in a while will ya?
how many shots do they take O_o
2,14 In fact, I'm rewriting Z2, they aren't dimensional beasts, they're bugs
05you are fightign a thick carapaced bug
Wrek: ah, see? THERE is the built in shotgun
Original book had power suits that could fly and had very heavy weapons compared to these. :P
00,03shotguns are for n00bs -_-
Why are you so violent Rico, it was only trying to hug you
The powered suits in Starship Troopers aren't "giant". They're only 8ft tall.
05with instict to eat your guts
Wrek: eeyup and brb
Nyst: according to neil patrick harris. Neil patrick harris has never led us wrong
Caramel, the Gundam was produced by the Earth Federation, another global government that isn't quite as evil as this government... but is stil pretty bad.
05Scoot-Scootaloo: shotgusn are SOOO MLG man
oh really
most retarded army ever
yep
^
Poor arachnids
ded
They're more like exosuits then mechsuits.
00,03Wrek: Awww HELLL naw!
"I'm sorry,we made a whoopsie."
00,10shotguns can fire more then just buckshot
They where only trying to greet their new neighbors with hugs
05Sumica: grenades!
I hate this part. Somehow the bugs having brains is impossible?
05love shotgun grenades
00,10yep
00,03except Spas-12's, they are totally for pros~
Wrek: Frag Rounds? :P
05that guy needsa bat to the head
lol this guy
no brains
xDX
And thus, not possible. :P
that dude is an idiot
00,10I just so happen to have one too scoot
Sure, they where trying to hug the humans with their jaws, but they ARE insects...
And thus we see the mindset of modern conservatives.
Spas-12's were the only /actual/ shotgun.
just sex
Scoot-Scootaloo: Especially in MW2! :P
limping back.
Ya..the only thing that put the bug down were those shotgun slugs
00,10for home defence
the thing is, the rifles the mobile infantry here uses is compeltely sufficient for bugs. armor piercing, high capacaty magazine and built in shotgun. these kids are just too dumb to use it right
the fail in that intercourse was just epic
Nyst yep :D
What is this?
Arn't they illegal?
she survived an inferno with just a cut?
In the US?
Alchemist: Plot Armor
She needs that one cut to look badass.
Funny how some of those ships got there w/o engines.
Alchemist: plot armor
she's a main character ofcourse she did
00,02morning
Mornin', Phase4.

Hello Phase4
Nittany_Discord: u can drift in space with no powah
Phase4: hey lad :)
Hello Phase4
Nittany_discord: intertia.
00,02Sumica, did the date get anounced?
Uh, do they have lasers to shoot at orbiting ships or something? XD
oh hai phase
mornin' Phase4
Phase4:
Hey Phase4
Nittany_Discord: funny how some of those ships got there withoutn EVERYTHING
how can the spaceships lie on top of each other? there's no gravity
ded
he ded!
Dark_Horst: Yea but if you don't hit them in the right spot, they can still be a strong threat. In any case for the huge numbers they face, they need something with higher destructive capacity IMO
Hello Phase4
they left them all behind
2,14 "Oh no, the boyfriend who's heart I broke on the eve of battle died"
05meh
Sure, blame your own lousy medical evacs screwing up on the bugs
05the acress is hot
05albeit annoyign sometimes
wia??
pony_300: thatÄS what i said, theyÄre too dumb to use them right
:o
Meanwhile, in the bacta tank...
05actress*

Oh thank god he had pants on
He's undead now. :p

u ded
you are dead, but you are alive?
he ded
my god this is much work
I have a confession
My hand is starting to hurt
Healing and limb regen in The Forever War was worse.
Bright Eyes is best pony
00,10just had a great idea as to how they could increse viewereship over the short term
he died but then came back to life
05welcome to my works Sonny
05i dont use a wrist support for nothing
why you gonna leave a kiss for me and wipe it off slut
CrimsonPhoenix: who's bright eyes?
thanks wrek
why dont these ships have sheilds
Take two.
05wold*
Dark_Horst: I don't think it's dumb so much as the situation. Don't have time to aim for brain stems or whatever on things that are as active and mobile as those things and attack enmasse
05world*
haha wrek :p didn't know that
They had to shut down your immune system to make it work, so the patients would form cancer tumors that each had to be treated as the limb was being regrown.
Atheist: shields r science fiction obviously. :P
I'll consider all your advise tough Wrek
Atheist: Shields don't exist in this Sci fi universe
it's like asking for a bullseye shot on all 100 of the rushing bugs coming at you
right back to work
pony_300: let'S call it inexperienced then
PAWNCHED
one does not simply talk about him
Already a bad first impression.
Ironside

Lt. Sam Fisher here.
fuc ya iron man
Ironside is naturally badass
Here's robo-Sam Fisher.
It's the terminator!
Damn I want a robot first thingy
NOT ONE STEP BACK

05you should totalyl fidn me an US accoutn to use
no plant life
GOD WHY DIDNT THOSE COME IN FIRST
finally air support
WHAT DO BUGS EAT?
One would assume THIS wouldve been a good opening move.
die !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
JT, problem with that is that you'd have to lose your real hand, and you'll have incomplete senses in a robot hand.
05or vice versa
00,10use Val's
Yes
incinerate!
oh, NOW they have airsupport...
Should have brought those fighterbombers when they hit klendathy
see? need more of that, lots more of that
Atheist: yeah, why XD
That is what they should have done FIRST.
2,14 >:(
Why didnt they just do that in the first place?
^
yep
why were they even on the surface?
But I would still have a super bad ass looking robot hand
00,10heheh
its stupid to be on the surface
i love roast bugs in the mornin'!
00,10and when Val wants to play with wrek he can use mine
we should bomb the planet from orbit
Wrek: if i felt like it i could lend you mine
Hey! Not now! We can hear your SCII

Good thing they NEVER have to reload :P
Waste all the ammo
Sounded just like a head crab.

Atheist: That requires a huge amount of energy
6:P
so its the future
6There are a lot of things we don't have here..
concentrated fire from 4 man to bring down one without losses....the humans need better weapons...
haha xD
we probably solved the energy crisis

One down, seven hundred million more to go.
05otakon: ofc, its weekend

Dat medic

Next episode air time is unknown.
Wrek: you crazy swede you
Scoot-Scootaloo, the only hand grenade ever used. The stuff they fire out of the RPG launchers are also grenades. Just not hand grenades.

Bugs going to return soon-Party
Fortunate they had someone there who knew how to plat it
they promoted him?
eeyup
Fl00t4hSh41: they seem to be favoured hobby instruments in the future. we saw the guy who grabbed it play one earlier in the barracks
bc the black lady was taken out of dutey
05nah script said no bugs, so they planned their strategy aroudn that
dat Dixie in Background.
Caramel: your streaming right?

So bro.
Caramel: Neil patrick harris would be proud
2,14 Let me play you the song of my people
Dark_Horst: But we haven't seen anyone else play violins
that means he's gonna go the way of Goose It hink
atheist: These guys arn't the Imperial gaurd xD
Seriously

Caramel, the song of your people is very pretty

05DerpyMuffins: yeah can you believe that guy? WHAT A WHORE
Ninjazz, NEVAAAAAH
Begin the kill clock
2,14 Ninjazz: that's like telling the sea to stop making waves
AdamTheDuck, CURSES!
those barely count as boobs
Is he cheating on his girlfriend here?
BUG CANIBALISM
that movie shows more boobs than game of thrones...
Kandarihu: they broke up
Caramel, I just wanted to try. :<
he has no girlfriend
I almost thought they were both guys for a second there
2,14 Kandarihu: she broke up with him the night of the battle
Eli: now i have to watch game of thrones dont i?
Married to pair like that. trust me, plenty there.
what did pegi say again`?
and his ex thinks he's dead
where tits
Eli: hahaha I don't think so :P
Dark_Horst: I just wonder why some supply officer thought a company of soldiers would need a violin with their R&R supplies
Colt_Silver, oh, okay. I missed that part.
Aaand my mum walks in
didn't the book this was based on have mechs
Axel_Dash: yeah, maybe you're right
Percy_Vee: lol I didn't mean anything by it but I think larger is more attractive in my opinion.

2,14 Good guy Razack
gotcha
Make it 20 minutes
A minute or so ago
20 minutes?
XD

Best. Sarge. Ever.
YOUTHG
THEY CAN DO IT
hahaha
20 mins!
war can wait
Best leader ever
fuck no i need a hr
ummm hai nudityscene soon as i log in
and then they bucked
alexxm|colt: Yup, that book was the trope namer for power armor and space marines
DaringDerpy: FUCK YA War can wait!
Sarge is like "...nice."
20 minutes? I guess he is giving them time for pillow talk.
wb Herostar
Big wasps for the win ^^
once again
I would follow that leader to hell and back :D
Hello Herostar
Haha, hello Herostar :P
Wb Herostar
hi Herostar
DESERT PLANET, NO VEGETATION, NO OTHER LIFE BESIDES THE BUGS
ello Herostar
well, if he isn't planing to get the girl off in any way, i guess 20's enough
This doesnt look like an ambush at all
perfect ambush area
what do bugs even eat?
love the welcoming committee -w-
is the movie going to end soon?
incoming!
this scene is my favourite mission in the game
05JT: rocks
nomnomnom
05pop rocsk to be exact
see something moving, don't tell your platoon
maybe the bugs eat rocks.Plenty of those there...
JT: anything but the point is there is NOTHING to eat on their planets
It just wanted to give him a hug
you sit in the outpost and get to shoot lots of shit
Yeah
00,03Sc0p3zzz
how can you not notice a 7 meter buzzing bug?
no one even fires
Maybe the bugs are a silicone based lifeformt that can metabolize minerals?
And he shoots his own dude instead of the bug
dat teamkiller
otakon: Are the bugs autotrophic? What do they eat?
and now you know what the bugs eat
00,03Friendly fire :|
Needs more quick scope.
well otakon maybe its just they know that those humans come xD
mercy
00,03also dat hard scope
SafariMonkey: no idea, but it's shown that they eat anything(cow, humans).
dam
As I said: Rico, The Master of Field Promotion.
Best leader ever
otakon: They live off of the flesh of their enemies
Scoot-Scootaloo, I think that was meant as a mercy kill.
Scoot-Scootaloo: Only noobs quick scope.
MLP_Brovakiin: the humans ONLY just got there
:P
otakon: They aren't silicium based if they can walk in the same atmosphere a carbon based lifeform can
Kandarihu: Eeyup
Whiskey outpost ^^ best battle scene ever
otakon: Yeah, but any biosphere needs autotrophs.
Fl00t4hSh41: they could be it's science fiction
also best mission
if everyone dies does that make rico fleet master of the enitre federation?
otakon: They have many enemies
a bug just killed everyone here... lets move in!
Some damn fort this is :/
SafariMonkey: what's an autotroph?
all the corpses
Eeyup
all corpses
NONE eaten
JT: You know the HL2 Mod based on this battle? With the real Theme?
What is the point of the enclosed base. The bugs can fly.
do you know what rank he has in the third movie xD
HL2?
otakon: No they can't, silicium can't make the right chemical compounds to be used to make life at room temperature
isaac702: not many flyers
JT: Half Life 2
hl2 is awesome
seeing as this whole planet is a complete wasteland, i guess the bugs eat anything. it's actually a realistic picture of our future. the bugs are a lot like us i suuppose
Fl00t4hSh41: true I guess
I don't play half life so nope
Actually, quickscoping ain't that hard. Just takes practice.
Wrek: Exactly. I like the way you think sir.
/me puts a muffin on otakon s ravaged face
throw a nuke down that hole
otakon: A primary producer: something that gets its own energy from non-organic sources
a bug
it's not dead O-O
ewwwww
they sucked his brain out!
xD
Zombie bugs :|
otakon: It would have to be hot enough for liquid Silicium or cold enough to liquid amonia to dislove the silicium in
odd thing is
ewww
bugs nomz brains!
best line ever
brain slushy yum
the wound is OUTWARD facing
zombie bugs
NOT inward facing like a puncture SHOULD be
They eat brains now?
Thats either -100 degrees celcium or several hundred degrees above boiling
on... deck? you relize you LEFT the spaceship, right?
Well brain bugs do :P
otakon: maybe the bugtentacle had barbs on it.
What movie is this?
otakon: yes, but not energy. They'd need a lot of mineral to get all that energy they're using.
Scootsy_Pie: starship troopers
Starship Troppers Scootsy_Pie
Thank you~
crazy man bursts out and says you're gonna be heroes. my reaction= :D yey /)^3^(\
otakon: ^Hc for most minerals is very low
2,14 your faces when you realize those mormon colonists probably fed them the location of earth
stfu
...whacks the man...
lol
WERE ALL GONNA DIE!!!! ;~;
SafariMonkey: they are the ONLY lifeform on the planet and it shows that they dig MANY MANY MANY miles under the planet in hives.
when does this movie end???
BUUUUUUUUUGS :O
... ._.

I WANNA LIVE FOREVER
here they come!

YOU WANNA LIVE FOREVER?!
Where did they put all that airsupport and those nuclear RPGS?

Nooooo. What gave them away? The grenade in the grub hole?
05oh look sumica
Caramel, why would Mormons do that?
BUUUUUUUUUGS :O
Get Rambo in here NOW!!!!!!
either would have been awfully useful here
05the zerg player massed swarm hosts
ZERG RUSH
Kandarihu: bc Mormons are weird
Its a trap....
2,14 Kandarihu: brain bug
Wrek: SO MANY LOCUSTS
dont these people know that helions counter zerG???????\
yatatatatatatatata
Derpymuffins: Admiral Ackbar ^^
What no nukes?
it's strange, i think i'm more scared of an everyday but than i would be of a 6 meter one... i think they would just disgust me in that size
otakon: They'd use more energy eating than they'd get. There just isn't that much enrgy available via chemical processes, so unless they're nuclear...
2,14 needs more ORAORAORAORAORA
00,10such a noob terren, he for got to tech for mech
otakon, that's some bad reasoning there.
bug*
Wrek: Swarm hosts are OP
Derpy_Hooves: and no airsupport either
noobs cant throw grenades
what?
00,10he dont even have hellions
i think these bugs are plants
2,14 Sumica: look at this newb, 3 missile turrets and only 1 bunker
God reload atleast
05MUTALISKS!
Need more Dakka
SafariMonkey: remember they DO have bugs that can crap out PLASMA BALLS
05HOW THE FUCK DID HE TECK SPIRE ALREADY

Decapitation
SafariMonkey: so maybe they ARE nuclear
Ofcourse not fl00t who do you thinkt they are? important people ?XD
05TECH*

decapitation!
whack
Atheist: If they where plants, they wouldn't have enough energy to move
hahaha
ded
pwned
Wow.
they have a freaking great aim these bugs...
00,10he would probably set his seage's in front of the bunkers too Caramel
He should have moved.
Welp, the general got boned
Premotion
IF they wernt plants then they couldnt exist theres nothing to eat
2,14 Sumica: >implying he wouldn't try to use SCVs as tanks
derp bugs
planet PENIS! CLEAR!
PLanet penis? Whut?
hey Wrek do you have TV 3 SWEDEN?
Atheist: They may have some other food supply?
00,10hey SCV's are usefull in heart of the swarm
bug ramp
WHERE ARE THE MORTARS?
WHERE ARE THE GRENADES?
the only answer is is that these bugs are an advanced form of plant life that somehow gains enough solar enrgy to survive and move around
i luv blasting bugs :3
well shit
ive seen this movie before actually
00,10make hellions in to battle mechs with them Caramel
otakon: plasma is just superheated, it can't cause nuclear effects (nuclear is unaffected by temperature) but maybe the plasma is nuclear in origin...
Im half expecting teh LT. to punch a bug in the face
Atheist: They could be growing mushrooms or fungy bellow the ground
dat swarm
they could do Legolas and Gimlis game here
shit another zerg rush -_-
SafariMonkey: well that's what I meant
yes run, let them catch you
00,10nice catch
impalement
and also mobile plants isn't completely out of the question either
Eli: Haha
got ya
otakon: Thought so. You might be right
Sumica: more like nice stab :P
First and last time they need to reload in the starship trooper series.....
Aww, the bugs just wants to give them a big hug
00,10where was gondor
why are they on that planet anyways? :P
2,14 >mfw as the bugs start climbing the walls, the people living below me play their music so loud the ground shakes
dat giant scope
*The bugs are nuclear!*
if there was fungal or plant life below then a visble ocean would definantly be noticeably on the surface and the planet would be greener
MLP_Brovakiin: 21. 22. 23. that one still just counts as one!
Caramel: lol
Caramel, dat ambience.
Finally
proper mobile infantry should have vehicles and drones
weee
backup!!!
Atheist: no ocean, it's literally a desert planet
hallo you wonderful peolpe!
Wow, Caramel.
make them count lolz
Hello Dken2021
Hi Dken
yes which is why the bugs must be Plants
Hey, Dken2021.
ohai Dken2021
hi Dken2021
00,10yeah for being moble infintry they sure are dependant on navy
yo Dken2021
Eli: A dwarf with an axe would fuck shit up in this situation :D
Carmbine NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
Atheist: The bugs could have brought the spores for the fungi with them
the hell?
Hey Dken2021
yeah shooting into the ground does NOT work
That's because they don't have heavy support.
EWW
Atheist: Either they're photoautotrophs or have nuclear reactors in them
Fl00t4hSh41: the spores are their eggs
Gimli would rip them all apart!
ewwwwww
2 AN A HALF MEN :3
its funny cause it just is
I thought he didnt have legs already?

SafariMonkey: well plasma "bugs" so second?
He can get new legs

uh
they are definatly Plant life
Mabye she can respawn
so... starship troopers eh?
how about instead of standing there and calling her name, you shoot the bug
her lung is pierced... how can she still scream
hello everypony
Hello FillyFlam

FLAMETHROWER
why does my bucking stream stop at the good parts, i missed the WHOLE fight
00,10yeah they do wrek
Zerg > Bugs
toasty bug :D
2,14 Sumica: Airforce- he's a dick
He is spraying hot cheese everywhere!
GET ME A MEDI-GEL
Herostar: That bug just had a lot of chili for breakfast
GET ME A GODDAMN MEDI-GEL!
Yeah. At this time last night, I was already back with dinner.
Does anyone know, what happened to Carmen between the first and the third Movie?
gets this girl some bacta
so has there been more "accidental" buffers?
00,03Wait, what happened to Barney?
Atheist: I agree, I just can't see them living underground if the're photoautotrophs
slut with her dreams man
yay
Dken2021: enope
They could have given the LT. new legs
NOooo... she was pregnant!
noooooooooooooo
ded
Scoot-Scootaloo: Ded/
00,10would have realy sucked if she coughed up blood all over his face
robot legs
bacta tanks (uncheck)
00,03NOO :'(
and then she voided her bowel
Awkward
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. The wingman died?
Scoot-Scootaloo: Wait, Barney was metal hand right?
Ninjazz: no the chick did
00,10soooooo, they are like the best damn bridge crew fleet has.
Oh. Damn. :/
00,03He's neil patrick harris :P
00,10why are they doing combat drop sorties?
he got promoted again
what other plans?
lol
Scoot-Scootaloo: oh him? He's still on earth
2,14 Sumica: I was thinking the same thing
I think he is LT. now
Sumica: Why else you they be flying a shuttle into a warzone?
ITS JUST A GODDAMN DESERT
05as they said
00,10operation stupid fleet formation 2 is a go
05they needed a crasy good pilate to land and pickem up
Scoot-Scootaloo: Oh. :P I don't know. I dont think they've shown him for the last hour.
lol
well just because they live undergorund doesnt mean they spend all their time under the ground
otakon: maybe theres more to it? :P
2,14 it just shows how much they think of the MI: "Send in the best for trivial work? Sure thing"
Hey, guys, look! A body we can actually bury for once!
so she died about 15 minutes after. estimate was wrong rfrom last night
Pilot lady doesnt have a scar over her eye anymore?
/me salutes
Ninjazz: One has to be the first
Ninjazz, and then they shoot it into space.
/me plays trumpet
launched into space
was gored to all hell. no bloodstains in coffin. seems legit
2,14 Klumzeedragon: and Rico doesn't have a giant hole in his leg. Advanced medicine
SPAAACCCE
BUCKIN LAAG!
spaaaaaceeee
the dude does not have hole leg to owwww
Kandarihu, they need space for the living people. >.>
besides it couldnt be anything else amyway, there is no other life on the desert planet they couldnt get energy any other way other than being canibals which i dought highly due to the ature of life to be programmed to preserve it
05a thosuand years later it will burn up at reentry
Neil!
cool uniforms
so they must be plants
00,02Fightclub!
Fl00t4hSh41, I'm suprised they only got one now.
Nazi?
Caramel: True. But why waste super medicine on a little eye scar? :D
is that NPH!?
Dat gestapo trenchcoat
Scoot-Scootaloo: See, he's alive
I would laugh if the coffin became a meteor and wiped out a city :D
2,14 Klumzeedragon: BECAUSE SHE GOTTA LOOK PRETTY
00,03yaay!
who names a planet P?????
Wow. Guess who's evil.
lame
FINALLY he figured it out
05MI: population control. not for the bugs, but for the uman speices
Atheist: I guess maybe they're really efficient, or they have solar farms
Human*
00,03that actually seems legit!
He gets new promotions every other week now
Caramel: Dudes dig scars though. :P
Dark_Horst: You'd think that stasi uniform would have been a deadgiveaway
lol, nickname of 'Atheist'
Atheist, since this movie was made, NASA discovered a real Earthlike planet that's about 20 light years away or something. They literally named it Planet C.
bound to invite trouble
ther helmets are stiofoam
Wrek is shwasted. Stop correcting his spelling. :D
Klumzeedragon: if only Meanwhile was here
Klumzeedragon: that's more of an opinion, right?
thats stupid nameing a planet by a letter is really really lame
Fl00t4hSh41: 1) i was talking about rico^^ 2) that'S a waffen-ss uniform
there is a KID in the front line
12yo
00,10what if his name was bob?
SERIOUSLY
KID
omfg like 14 year olds
Thats a kid
i is have BROWNIES
otakon: Why's that? :D
00,10more like earth Scoot-Scootaloo
Eli: I suppose it is. :P
What was the name of this again?
EVASIVE MANUVERS
Hey. He has the right to fight as much as anyone else.
Klumzeedragon: bc he's British and he LOVE being a spelling/grammar nazi.
05same mistake twice
05with the formation
again the humans fall for the same tricl
aaaaand closed fromation again. becasue that was SUCH a good idea the first time
Dark_Horst: It's still a blatantly evil looking trenchcoat
Atheist: Remember they can only capture the energy from light that hits them. That's 1kw/m^2 on earth, not a lot for something like that
FOR EARF!
Wrek: I know
Starship troopers
00,03In the future, Earth is renamed: Amearth
Major: Starship Troopers.
Holy crap if my stream cant play the movie for more than 5 seconds i out
'MEARTH.
why are they attacking the planet in the first place
Why don't they park their fleet further away from the planets?
?
And THiS is why you don't cluster ships together if the enemy has Surface to Orbit bombardment capabilities.
fire in space@@@@@
humans are idiots. they deserve to die
Like outside the range of those plasma bugs
who was here for the buffering problems last night?
Fl00t4hSh41: dropship range
05eli: to fidn a bainbug, you not payign attention?
wow dat was a direct hit
05its sooooo obvious
00,10would have been funny if the rear half went to warp
Well shit.........
Snowflake, they have oxygen on that ship
DaringDerpy: very sad, but just as much true
Dusty: me
death, death everwhere
I for one welcome our new bug overlords!
Humans: YEY we're going to escape! :D bug: NOPE.AVI
abandon ship!
on the oputside and that air still would not be that much to make a big fire
maybe the bugs skin is made of a chemical that has an 83% effeciency at caputuring light energy, making it more effecient than all photosynthesizing lifeorms
eyeyey
that sucks
Why do the spaceships "sink" when hit?
00,10there were no buffering problems last night, it was buffering awsome
JESUS
Wrek: ... not so much
ahhh
abandon ship!
Fl00t4hSh41 gravity?
she ded
Fl00t4hSh41: Gravity of the planet
05eli: jstu keep in midn peopel might not be so keen on explainign when you've been given the answer and ignored it
Sumica: made the movie beter
this is wreck not a ship
Fl00t4hSh41: They are in Low Orbit.
scotty could fix it
lol i just read starship troopers
Sumica: true, the buffer was on fire!
But they are in a stable orbit, no?
and watched it
gravity fields are shaky
Explode ALL the things
We really enjoyed the buffering last night.
00,10yes is was as if the buffer was being controlled
Not after impact... throws off speed and trajectory
Fl00t4hSh41: ... space physics? they should float backwards actually
Fl00t4hSh41: they had engines to keep them at an orbit
flips like a boss on ship going down
SUPAHNOVA
Or are they wasting massive amounts of energy on making themselves easier targets by holding still?
2,14 Sumica: LIES! WE WOULD NEVER FORCEFULLY BUFFER OUR STREAMS <.< >.>
maybe the bugs have a thinner atmospher on there planet letteing in more light energy and have more efficent means of light to energy conversion
>Ship that houses hundreds
Sumica: yeahhhh...^_-
2 man esacpe pods not that good
>Escape Pods only fit TWO people
Atheist: so that's up to 2 kw per bug, when it's on the surface.
Bridge escape pod.
idiots
Atheist: ok, 3kw
this movie has SO MUCH IDIOCY
otakon: logic not found
Caramel: really? because sometimes, you just hit THE perfect second for buffer
isnt that the escape pod from screamers?
Caramel: shenanigans
Sumica: Like our Batman buffer earlier? :D
Dark_Horst: and then re-used assets too
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIGHCoVzqtk have a soundtrack
I'm not sure flying a life shuttle to the planet full of bugs is a good idea.
no vid links
inb4 no vid links herpderp
No vid links
damn im too slow
no video links during stream
00,10I have no idea what you meen Klumzeedragon >_>
so...this movie's still going....
What they said.
watch it robotdragon9
sorry bout that forgot
AND BOOOM
05robotdragon9: good
nop[e
otakon: yeah, lots of the equipment reappears in the movie world. especially armor and guns
oh god ik this scene
05next time you forgettign will not save your ass
Sumica: Oh you know what? I must be mistaken. <_<
00,10da shit is this, starcraft trys to optamise now/
shit this won't end well ;~;
By this point in the movie, half of the community wanted Carmen's head on a silver platter.
Wrek: the mod with no mercy
:)
Do they not have airbags in the future?
3kw is + to 2581261.9502868 calories so thats wayyy more than enough to suport the buglife
bugopolis
>Fighting giant goddamn bugs
05Sumica: yeah they otimize to remove uneeded files and tidy up the isntall to take less spaec
stay i nthe space proof glass!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I wonder if they will make a movie of "Old man's war"
>takes a LITTLE damn K-Bar knife
brb
situation is somewhere
Dark_Horst: Quite right. The Starship Troopers guns and armor reapear in Firefly as Alliance infantry kit
awww shit i was right >~<
00,10I just installed it how dose it know what it dont need?
I think the bugs can speak better for the humans' situation than Carmen.
damn
there goes the leg
up dat *ss
butt stab
awww yeah
Right in the ass.... ._.
All the ded.
and ded
not the best way to go
Woah. That guy took it in and OUT the butt
surprise fun
rescue party? LETS PARTAAAY
GOLD TEAM RULES.
he smiled
00,03what a trooper~
3kw is more than enough to suppport buglige
Sumica: it requires Battle.net to run, start it up and it'll auto update
life
"Sorry buddy."
:'(
she's not already dead
he was right, she was good as dead
she acts well
Atheist: No, it's 62000 cal/day
braaaainzzzz!
little bugs!
thus the little bug children will feast
the book wasnt much like this actually
o_O
there was a book of this movie?
He seems remarkably calm for someone who has a giant alien arm sticking through his leg
is that per bug SafariMonkey
and a game
There was a book first.
the movie was originally a book
2,14 the book came WAY before the movie
05other way around pony_300
pony_300: no. there was a movie of this book
00,10just seems silly that before I even patched the game it's deleting parts of it
hah, well the more you know
00,03Yes, movies based on books tend to some out after the movie -_-
00,03come*
00,10did you know they did an anime that folows the book closly Caramel?
Atheist: assuming 3m^2 area
2,14 I heard, but never saw it
Scoot-Scootaloo it worked for twilight
00,03...anime?
00,10yep
gotta watch dat anime
Earth Defence Force?
The book was from back in the 70'ies or some such
00,10they did a good job on the anime
2,14 was it any good?
the question "there was a book of this movie" is surprisingly hilarious... when is there ever a book made from a movie?
05Sumica: i love the way the marauders were in that
00,03I have a feeling the aliens have more tentaces in the anime...
and here comes the giant vagina bug
Caramel: you should stream the game some time :P
Quite frequently.
2,14 what I've always wondered:
00,10and yeah the marauders were good
Scoot-Scootaloo: don't got here
Caramel: yes?
2,14 why the hell doesn't he keep the knife for himself?
its the advisor
tha brainbug...
Eli It happens very often,actually
you also play a marauder in the game
Eli: Theres a lot of books based on the star wars movies
Caramel: no idea
brainsucker
dat fat bug
dat boner
a peace offering?
vagina face vagina face vagina face haahah
nope
eeeeeeeeewwwwwwwwwwwww
05vagina spiiike of heeeell
well that doesn't look suggestive
bug boner
dear god it's disgusting
mind rape time
ewwwwwwwwwwwww
Fl00t4hSh41: apart form fanfiction
Eww.
and then PENETRATION
It just wants to give hima hug
Dken2021: if your peace involves holes in your head
A brain hug mind you
I,for one,should still have my book of Pokemon:The first movie lying around somewhere
bug want to nomz brains
But a hug none the less
ded
Sweetjeesusthat'sterrifying.
and STAB
not again
if each bug produces enough light energy to make the equivlent of just 2000-4000 calories then the bugs
mindfuck redefined
omg
brain eater
again?
same spot
O_O
another accidentall buffer
AGAIN!
as yesterday
Oh, it buffered here last night, too.
Eww.
great special effects
slurrp sluuuurrrrrrp
actually that should be damn near painless
Like a juice box. :)
we sure that buffer wasn't intentional?
the brain can't feel ANYTHING
that has to hurt like a bitch
mm brain slushie
Yum.
tastes liek chicken
Herostar: brain has no nerve endings
But the hole in the skull probably smarts a bit.
otakon: But the skull around it can
and now they're saved
00,10other then the part where it punches a hole throught your skull otakon
otakon your other senses would go to crap anyways
Fl00t4hSh41: only for a second
Atheist: You mean recieves
what if...there really is no buffer actually...
why didnt he keep the brain for himself lol
I mean the knife
its a puhhhh
not the brain xÇD
looks like a piggy
otakon: Your bones are covered in quite a lot of nerve endings
Big, fat, smart bug.
otakon: That includes your skull
And the sensation of your brain, your entire throught processes being horribly disrupted.
why is this war even happening again....WHY did the bugs launch the meteor?
what we watchin?
Fl00t4hSh41: yeah well that's like saying there is something akin to a painless death
robotdragon9: they didn't
robotdragon9: it just happened
05otakon: yes they did
05they said it even
The trauma alone would make you scream your lungs out though.
05with bug plasma
robotdragon9, if the bugs even did launch it, it was billions of years ago.
00,10amazing how the 4 of them can kill so many bugs
Wrek: the MEDIA
shoulda thrown the damn bomb to kill it when they leave
._.
Wrek: FOX News says a LOT of stuff
05otakon: THE MEDIA IS THE TRUTH
00,03Propoganda FTW~
yeah
Sumica: they're max level.
00,10when you know whole armys are cut to shreds by the bug before
i dont know anything any more ._.
M-M-M-M-Monster kill!
robotdragon9: mankinds expansion into space intruded on their territory. being a hive, they were not so cool with that
The guns go from 10+ to kill one bug
2,14 Knowledge is power Sumica :P
to 4 to kill a few
Sumica: well perhaps it's the funnel tactic working to their advantage
Hero units, Sumica.
It's a global government run media that said it.
oh well now i know
run !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
to 4 to kill dozens
run!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
damit run
GOODBYE COOL WORLD
Nice of the bugs to give them time to say their goodbies before they rush them
Tatical nuke ready for launch repreat tatical nuke ready for launch................tatical nuke inbound!
they like that?
to my question, about books made from movies, forget it, i just remembered "50 shades of grey" but i guess that counts as a fanfiction too
otakon: Better aim?
SafariMonkey: yeah I guess
yes i do but the point is is that the bugs could probably generate enough energy to support there life, i mean they must generate enough energy photosynetically to survive because there is no other way for them to survive
oh thank you cave
00,10just just out run the fire, no worry about the air presure wave or the radiation
Movies
they eat there own poo
Welp now to wait forever until the finale of turnabout storm
bye Atheist?
I don't have time to worry 'bout dat.
Sumica: Or the way the cave would focus the blast to amplify it
what no i just refreshed
Sumica it worked for every other action protagonist
wat
Atheist: random cutout on yor part
Sumica: also, every kid knows that you can outrun a fire wave in a tunnel
You can tell the thing is terrified.
yes
Victory music~
they catched it!
After all, humans are the invaders here.
explosion 10/10 lol
eeyup
does that mean they won?
technically yes
the future is now kill the giant brain
how did they do that so fast?
vagina face hahahah!
it's still alive
There are several brains.
still has the oozy slimy gina face
giant vagina bug whisperer
lol
mentallyeffedguy, the brain bug survives to the 3rd movie, from what I read.
lol
00,10it's thinking " I CAME!"
"its scared"......well that was a hard job
d'aww how cuuuute <3
00,03Barney knows his way around women~
I would think so
:D

yeah? wohoo someone is afraid of us? like the doctor said once: the human race is a monster
Well, we're not going to be watching the sequels anyway, right?

From way back.

Private
Degraded himself to Private.

We need SOLDIERS
So we're the anal probers
they censore so funny things, but never how people are ripped apart
WE NEED YOU
lETSS ROOOCKKKK!!!!!
We need more MEDICS
Eli: that's the point
ya more medics
SERVICE GUARANTEE'S CITIZENSHIP
that actually sounded more like russian propaganda
we want you for medic!
GET TO THE CHOPPAS
You need more medics
they're gonna need some medics
00,10this movie would have been so much better if they had the muraders in it from the start
that was amazing
i'm a medic :P
What if tht was the brain's anus?
00,03MLG/10
i feel like joining right now xD
is that a dutch guy?
Eli: the censored parts are national propaganda tv. it'S in-lore
me and my bro rate the movie 1000/10
paul verhoeven
redhead tits/10
lol
Flesh_Wound/10
brainz/10
its kinda inhumane to tourtue that creaturelike that but i can find rest in the fact th brain bug did thatsame kinda stuff to thousandsof humans
Scoot-Scootaloo, this is uncomfortable enough without you tieing my country into the worst of this.
are we goinng to watch the second one?
05manwhore reco/10
explosion 10/10
6/10 casue it just seems like filler to me
i got to pee

Normal penalty.

then Dash starts cheating
JT: he does that a lot. he also seems to be progressing in direction of her bug with every episode
DAAMMMM

JT: eeyup

Eeyup
JT: *butt

Eeyup.

Spike wishes Rarity would buck him.
MEDIC
yes, i relly liked starship trooper,s why you ask?

2,14 it is a little unfair that they have RD go immediately after spike is worn out
animal abuse
Poor spike :(

Caramel: true

Welcome back ponyfromPR

Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Discussion: Give Applejack an Episode
ohai ponyfromPR
poor spike

dragons can't feel pain
lol puns
dat pun
when will the lottery be held?
how is everybody?
so an actual AJ epside eh?
Alchemist: yesterday

we know RD is a ball boucing champeen
>no derpy distraction

KArma
twilight wins the episode
ponyfromPR: Quite well. :) Yourself?
it nearly hit Lyra
GET TO COVER
derpy ^^
im good thx :)
inb4 hax
and then RD starts to cheat
All of a sudden Twilight was blind.
00,10so was that blueberry punch?
I'm more disappoint in the "judges" that they didn't catch ANY of that.
seriously, THIS one is cheating
They can already do more than me
why you cheatin rd
peeps!
geez, they sure can jump far
dat cheats
so nopony else sees dash is cheating?
well this one isn't cheating really
but the flying in the long jump and this for sure
00,03Sc0p3zzz-
this one is XD
00,10and then we all understood why Scoot-Scootaloo likes Dash so much
SEE?
She should have lost
00,03...noooo
Oh come on
JT: cheating? >_> who's cheating? <_<
00,03I'm more of an Applejack kind of guy~
Shenanigans
XD
Now this should have been obvious.
Dken2021: AJ doesn't have wings and FLYING to improve your long jump is DEFINITELY cheating
00,10it's called a long jump Dken2021
so basically pegasi are as athletic as earth pnies PLUS they have wings
this episode needs more Rarity
Dken2021: not short flight
...
twilight_sprinkle: only RD
twilight_sprinkle: yeah but they suck at growing plants usually
Would somepony be nice and help with a hair-colour decision?
Unnr: for what?
Queen Chrysalis custom
....
still, no set rules
Eli: theyre bost one of the best athletes. they both won in equestria competitions
Trying to decide between : http://imgur.com/nMxIf or http://imgur.com/FfpoC
00,10Unnr, plad. You can never go worng with plad
light emerald green, flat should work
Unnr: go for rainbow. always use rainbow
brohoof
Sumica: plaid
BROHOOF
only 4 ponies< RACIAL DISCRIMINATION
Unnr, for tail?
poor spike
haha
Mane and tail, but tail is easiest to plan with
Caramel, I see you're using the 1080p version. Back to a good computer?
non-ponies not allowed to compete.
Unnr: second choice
Unnr second one kinda looks better
Pinkiepie with her random comments ^^
THE EYES!
was that trixie?
derpy
LOOK AT HER EYES
derpy ^^
2,14 ...when have I been on a bad computer...?
I was fearing that...
there a pony in a bucket on my screen
I suppose the lighter blue
>_<
Unnr: why?
dat smile
ooo
:P
and then they were into bondage
Unnr not enough hari?
kinky
otakon: that is a custom blend between a really violent turquoise and the darker colour
acourding to ajs back shes in 8th place
*hair
and it has to be mixed by hand
Unnr: well that's what works
Unnr, lighter blue just looks better in my opinion
00,10and then every one said pinkie was a bad comentater because she only talked about her friends
lol pinkiepie
pinkie is biased
fire her
Caramel, you were around but not using colors. I asked you why and you were understandably upset with me over that.
Unnr: custom man, they take time and effort but if you want it to look good you need to do that
2,14 My Little Announcer: Favoritism is Magic
dat 42
42 yay!
stretching eye muscle's!
dat answer
Caramel: Favoritism?
lol
GO TWI
2,14 Yes, because the computer I was on died and I didn't have mIRC on this one until today
RD laughs now
/me facehof
42
but then she loved Daring Do
inb4 twi pwns them
why is she friends with rainbow anyway
mmm dat 42
I see.

Hai everypony! :)

Rainbow is such a jerk

Hello PinkiePry

Atheist: well you've never joked around with your friends before on stuff like that?
Hey PinkiePry :3

hiya PinkiePry
Obsidian: Twilight is the awnser to life, the universe and everything
ohai PinkiePry

TITLE DROP
Well, I've just disrespected two mods in close succession.
title drop
42 is actually a reference to Alice in Wonderland
...
I've never heard that
Kandarihu: do three and you win a prize!
no i havent, but then agian i dont have any friends -__-
lazy ass leaves
MLP_Brovakiin: except for the question "what's the best book?"
her freckles were gone
and then Spike was speechless
I LIKE FUDGE

Eli: Haha true

Poor Spike.

inb4 barack
SafariMonkey: 63.7% more nose.
FACEPLANT
well, greta, now we have to shoot her
I've honestly wondered if I'd be permabanned by the time S3 premiers. It's looking more and more like I will.
annoyingly the flat dark blue that was 1 is actually closest to Chrysalis blue doing an averaged colour sample
mmmmm dat 42
so many dead trees....its beautifuuul

00,10barock o bam a

why you stop RD?

Atheist: that sucks
hiya Lyra` what's up?
2,14 The difference between AJ and RD:

owned
ohai Lyra`
just watching adult films with the sgt
2,14 AJ sees she was mistaken, tries to catch up anyway
2,14 RD doesn't see, and starts cheating
like blade runner
eye derp incoming
not really hating everything is kinda fun then u get to complain alot
Lyra`: ah
and saving private ryan
it's only a game
Atheist: <.<
....
And that is where Discord gets his little jab at AJ from...
really movies that shouldnt been seen by chilodren
seems legit
suddenly hotdogs
its just for adults :3
this is one of the moments i really dislike RD
Lyra`: agreed
I would consider AJ and dash to be red oni, blue oni
She's so loyal to her promise not to cheat
Caramel, the difference between loyalty and honesty widens.
wut hotdogs?
Welcome back where pinky?
i hate everything exluding things i like
...
HEADSHOT
2,14 yeah, don't really think "Loyalty" is covered in this episode
inb4 lonney tonnes

pullll
backfired again...
2,14 true, yeah
cartoons physics
dat hax
taz
I was planning on starting a Bronystate Team on PSO2 next week. This is going to complicate matters greatly.
aj is really bad at this
i'm calling hax
It's more like "eye for an eye", imo.
2,14 though I can't say I wouldn't act the same if I had to deal with RD
But tempers run pretty hot.
its a difrent dimension
lmao
00,10aye, AJ shows alot of signs of being a scorpio

Scoot-Scootaloo: Background pony that they neglect to mention through out the whole race. :P

and everyone else leaving
night*
Gnight, everyone.
Most cases of races where a major character is racing is presented by only the character being covered by the professional sportscasters without any regard to other racers. It's just like here, but in MLP, it was justified by Pinkie Pie and Spike only talking about the ponies they personally know.
Scoot-Scootaloo: Server code? :3

It's said that any generation that's known freedom and lost it will never see it again.
Badassness achieved
I mean DAMN
I bet we all watched one episode of g3
What is this?
Hipster-Pony: have you heard of the cake?

Heavy cousin!
He's a prisonerer. Therefore he has been selected to star in the next Elder Scrolls game. :D

Not bad. Renegade was an alright shot as an FPS in my opinion.
armor up
fluttershyFTW multiplayer?
thats jail and today's his day
I ran out the door
They should try again, but EA would make so much of the campaign and weapons as DLC.
Good gae graphics or bad movie graphics?
Hipster-Pony: you only watched one episode of what?
yikes he's being SEALED IN HIS SUIT
*game
mentallyeffedguy: I was young at that time

killerpony7733: i lost my c&c renegade game a year ago. so cant
Sumica: or fart :P
Hipster-Pony: what do you mean?
Sumica:DONT JINX IT

hes locked in there foreve pretty much
Okay, I change my mind.
I -need- to buy this game.

Hipster-Pony: have you watched the FIM mlp?
killerpony7733" i did and apperently im decent most of the time i just pray and spray

Dovah: why do you think we're discussing suicide
Atheist: if you hate everything, it is!
SirGanjalf, yeah. I'll gladly suicide in games if there's a good reason for it. Only because I can respawn.
/me sets fire to Private
You can't learn and grow and find reasons to live if you kill yourself.
/me burps
..why are talking about killing ourselves
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-sU6foM5ws
Kinixys: if you respawned, yeah
its relevent
oh derp, I saw can
sorry
name, ask the people who are pro-suicide over here.
<.<
shit
/me throws bronysith to the endless abyss and closses up hole
Cause we're all sadistic people ;D
...
pay no attention to the man behind the curtain
xD
:'( BUT IM TOO YOUNG TO DIE
cowvarkian: Video games teach life lessons!
Nife: im not sadistic. that was an insult! im just mentallyeffed!
name: No, sleep my child...you shall be young forever...
Nife: sadism is much less "dying" and much more "pleasure from pain"
...
....
why are we talking about this?
cowvarkian: Exactly..
... :(
i think i hate everything because nothing has a point
Atheist and cowvarkian. PinkaPie was talking about it earlier as well.
because boredom
/me is asleep
Atheist: Wouldn't that mean everything has a point?
Atheist: well thats your own fault
It's not much of a sadism if you're hurting yourself...
Atheist, maybe your world view is all screwed up.
Petrified_Discord: there i fell asleep
name: Good job
i cutt my self whit knifeH for pleasure, sadistic
Atheist: wouldnt the point in life be that nothing has a point?
Atheist: No, the world isn't call based on spheres. I see some points here and there.
now excuse me as i potty train myself
mentallyeffedguy: Y U MENTION MY USERNAME
cowvarkian: Pencils have points
Petrified_Discord: tru fax
a meaning
Look what we have done: Because of this talk stream commited suicide D:
dont play with my words
meaning of life is living it.
Atheist: but thats what makes this fun
mentallyeffedguy: Stop advertising my stuff! XO
Nife: i ment knifeh
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyIiixA0ez0&list=PL37AFDCDEC17BD619&index=44&feature=plpp_video
:O words have turned into a vedeo games
video
Nife: never

Nife: ever
back

otakon: i want
Atheist: Oh atheist. All joking aside. If the world has meaning, it's because we must give it such.
MaxTheBrony: it is? i thought it was about dying D: guess i should put away this knife...
enope
im out guys, or else my dad is going to beat me and i have to cry myself to sleep!
Heya otakon

/me entering douche mode
D:
Ruuun
Dovah: i did that ages ago
g'night mentallyeffedguy
Allo everyone.
heyo Meanwhile !
hey
mentallyeffedguy: Surprised you recognized me with my handicapped k and h dropping off my name
how are things Meanwhile
Is steam over?
yes the world has a meaning but only from an individuals perspective but try to see things as existance and nothing more and youll see the irellivance of existance itself
Atheist, everyone dies. And there's a time and place for everything. I take it that you're a materialist?
back
Atheist: the world would be a great place and have plenty of meaning if you werent around so please do us all a favore
the stream is temporarly down
cause no host.
HAY GUYS
Atheist- it all depends on your point of view, a compleatly materialistic point of view indeed has no point. Doesnt meen death has a point either. I hope you dont kill yourself but i dont know what I can say to change your mind, you seem hell bent on hoplessness.
Oh boy, I really didn't show up at a good time did I.
evryone dies but no one knows how or when
hai Meanwhile
hey Flootahshy
Allo T.
Meanwhile: not exactly
Relegious debate?
no
I honestly would give a raging crap if someone suicided
hopelessness doesnt mean death, that wouldbe equally irellivant
Flootahshy: Not quite. meaning of life and shit
suicide debate
fucking hasbro, raised the price 2.5 times on amazon for sparkly twi
Flootahshy, better than a suicide debate.
Ah.
Suicide debate is worst debate.
Worse than best pony debate
not nearly, Petrified_Discord
:p
suicide debate is one of my top 5 debates
Petrified_Discord, best pony debates are much nicer than this.
Why we talking about suicide , it only makes me depressed...
suicide is never on my debates
/me points gun at myself
am i holding this the right way
Suicide debate? What's there to debate about?
Kandarihu: id rather have a suicide debate than best pony debate
/me points gun at name "Put the gun down or I'll shoot"
>.>
/me jumps of a cliff
Guys this is a pony chat and we are discussing suicide.....
Guys, two weeks ago one of my friends did that, so please change topic. Seriously.
/me remembers blazing saddles
Everyone just shush and listen to some relaxing music :3 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tCgxhsz8tM
Meanwhile, Atheist and cowvarkian are talking about killing themselves.
HOW ABOUT WE JUST TALK ABOUT HOW PINKIE PIE IS THE BEST PONY
Kandarihu: Right, and?
Kandarihu: how the fuck am I talking about killing myself?
Flootahshy: YES PLEASE
/me points at Petrified_discord shoots"oops"
im not gonna kill myself that would be meaningless
Flootahshy: >:I
DISCORD IS THE BEST ANTAGONIST
i agree name
Flootahshy: seems to be an odd spelling of Discord but i'll roll with it
name: villain
name: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBaSxHVPYyA
APPLEJACK NEEDS MORE EPISODES
everything is meaningless so i simply divulge in the pointlessness of the universe
Atheist- That reminds me of a quoet ""Thales was proclaiming that death isn't any different than life. 'So, why don't you die?' someone asked. 'Because there is no difference' he replied."
he gives chocolate rain i have to give kudos to that
it would be hilarious if AJ doesnt get a song in s3
Well I can agree with that one.
Atheist: C'mon man...this isn't philosophical anymore. It's just...kinda bleh.
Atheist: please just die so everyone else may lead a happy existance?
Dovah: WOA DUDE c'mon
happyness is irrelivant
<<< WJATCHA SAY
/me Is worried about Toy_PON3 now :S
twilight_sprinkle: a solo song you mean?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POlRUxMpd64&list=UUT2SpyOpcX7nt6VAfmiQdzg&index=9&feature=plcp
yay, douche bag dovah to the rescue....
Anyone in here know how to both, make a gif, And set it as your spray?
MadSurge: yeah or lead
I SAY IT BEACUSE ITS CAKE
best song ever there
twilight_sprinkle: That would be even more depressing than this debate.
Dovah: Not cool
Petrified_Discord: did you miss my message about me entering douche mode?
cowvarkian, sorry. I misunderstood.
Problem with atheists Dovah?
Dovah: No
http://askprincessmolestia.tumblr.com/image/12816795637 SHUT UP AND LOOK AT THIS
Atheist: OK dude, your just bumming me out. Is this some form of trolling?
Dovah: I mean yes
best song ever in my child hood http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POlRUxMpd64&list=UUT2SpyOpcX7nt6VAfmiQdzg&index=9&feature=plcp
its fine, Kandarihu
Apathy is pretty low on the list of qualties to cultivate.
Petrified_Discord: ah i see
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwL65cvzK0s
Hrm
Not hard at all
Eli O.o wrong ping or?
max woops nevermind, my chat stuck derp
ah
yeah
:)
Meanwhile: oh no my view on religion is extreamly flexible
no im not trolling
I dont have a silly spray...
/me is apathetic...
Make a gif, no. But the spray settings are in the options menu.
I don't think that sprays take gifs, though. Do they?
/me douche mode over
Kinixys, apathy is not a quality. It's a vice.
Bronysith: never tried waffles, are they sweet or salty?
Oh, you're looking for an animated gifd.
*gif
MadSurge: Depends if you put salt on 'em
Ive seen moving sprays :o
Snowflake, you had the best childhood
Kinixys: true, apaty is just...kinda sad
Yeah
*apathy
Oh, yeah
Atheist: Than why spread your negative influence on everypony else?
well, I'm not really apathetic I guess
MaxTheBrony: it was about your pic you posted, but i guess that's hours ago. my chat stuck :P
Kandarihu: Nice one!
in truth i think most of my hatred for everything is BASED ON THE LACK OF A STREAM:D
i better get into uniform for the live show at BFF
Supposedly it's possible to take an animated gif and convert it into a VGA format to use it.
Misery loves company Flootahshy.
If you have the original I can try.
Atheist: The meaning in life is stream
I just could give no fucks
Petrified_Discord: ah, it's sorta like pancakes?
Atheist: HEY! DONT TALK ABOUT THE BUFFER SHOW LIKE THAT!
MadSurge: Pancakes are salty?
I'm actually quite entertained by all this
Hey guys. What's going on?
CrimsonPhoenix transformrs baby the movie ani
WHAT IS LOVE
Atheist: Its mah favorite show :3
http://i.imgur.com/JwwqF.jpg

PillowPoni: AND I SAY HEEYYAA

Snowflake, he died for your sins
Stream killed itself long time ago - see, that
DONT HURT ME NO MORE
That's starting in 5 minutes. I wanted to work on troubleshooting some networking.
name: wrong song
Petrified_Discord: eh, I might be talking nonsense. :D
CrimsonPhoenix ???
Meh, a friend an i were chatting and he wants "buffering" sprays.
Snowflake, come on
*and i
CrimsonPhoenix ?
You know what's after that song
Atheist, don't kill yourself. Good things to you if you hold on to life.
Okay I'm going to harass my mom all night until she agrees to watch MLP with me. XD
twilight_sprinkle: I SAY HEY, WHAT'S GOIN' ON
eh nvm
Good luck with that.
Well
Meanwhile: DID IT BUFFER RIGHT THERE? REALLY? :D
It wouldn't be that hard, when you think about it.
Like the Windows one.
alexxm: I'm fine. Played some MvM today. Twas awesomesauce
The problem is getting the right resources.
yeah cowvakian
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_ULg4RSy5Y

He died for our sins
MadSurge: Lagship troopers buffered 16 times and I have caps of all of them.
CrimsonPhoenix no i rember that song and the movie contructions bots and and the boy rideing on a hover borad

http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/35kdgt/

Alright Atheist, here is the scoop. Secular Materialism has no point that gives anything inherrant meaning. Im sorry, there is nothing I can say to make things better for you except suggesting change your belifes.
whoo!
If you can actually find an animation of it, it shouldn't be too hard to dump into VGA.

Allegr0: !!!!!!1

Allegr0 WE MISSED YOU SO MUCH! YOU LEFT AN THEN I DIDNT KNOW WHAT TO DO AND NOW ITS A WEEK LATER AND I FOUND YOU
Eli: I actually dont know the characters at all from Kingdom hearts only knew it existed, and it suppose to be Riven from LoL :3
its not like pointlessness is depressing (at least for me) its kinda nice actually
how bout some good ol fashioned secular humanism....
Hey Allegr0. See I can say hi without sounding like a kissass.
Bronysith: Epic!
cowvarkian: /)
Kinixys: those instincts can be bad
Howdy everypony!
cowvarkian, we've had more than enough of that. No thanks.
cowvarkian: Secular humanism is humanism without a pont

Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Wallpaper Compilation #64
Atheist: Materialism+the belife that the physical world is all there is.

GigabitHarmonie: Allegr0 i am going to have to give you guys the biggest glomping of your life, i missed last weeks show due to dragoncon
twilight_sprinkle: the movie 9
that could have a large number of meaning
So many buffer memes...
http://j.wigflip.com/38NBZ060/roflbot.jpg
Alright. Confusing Atheist's views with materialism was my mistake. Sorry about that.
Awww, did you have fun Bronysith?
Major: k thx
Petrified_Discord: http://i.imgur.com/B8KkZ.jpg
I saw the picture of you and Tara!
Bronysith: its fine dude, we didn't do an official show last week :P

GigabitHarmonie: Allegr0 also there was a little brony get together ...
PillowPoni: Still better than NASCAR
thx CrimsonPhoenix... i have nothing against gay relationsships, but it kinda creeped me out, and it ruined my search
PillowPoni: OmgNoWayMineToo!
if you guys can hold it for a sec, we're about to go live :P
Atheist: its the inherrant stance most atheists have, that there is nothing like 'God' and stuff.
Petrified_Discord: I know, right.
Allegr0: GigabitHarmonie and this happend... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bqAagn8RGc
Flootahshy: I wonder what episode this is *watches*

GigabitHarmonie: What's happening in this show?

I think the Rina-chan hate flash is called "Streat fighter"... something. Its NSFW if I remember correctly. Appearently, she gets lots of hate because she takes all the female voice acting gigs and makes non-funny flashes.

I'll use this site here and draw a ship by random
Ponymon-Anarchy: She voiced Firefly in G1 mlp.
It'll be useful for IT, or just to have.
ah ok
Shizuka: added it to my "learning" playlist , yes i have that. i'll watch it later
13alternatively those of you with gmod should look up "the elements of computing systems" and build a cpu with wiremod
Your mission if you choose to accept it is to do a ship fic of what I will post
As a weaboo would probably say it: "OMG THE OLDER GENERATIONS ARE NICE BUT THEY'RE NOT REALLY KAWAII DESUUUUUUUU"
Kinixys: Really? Then have her play Rainbow Dash's mother.
everypony ready?
Has everyone here watched the CR retrospective of MLP? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K2aIA6nOiw
