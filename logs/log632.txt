twilight_sprinkle: the game is as scary as Resident Evil 4 :D
i found the ending to be damn cool being sucked out into space
I wanna go to space
Alister, I hope you're lying
/me mind returning to normal
That's the power of editing
twilight_sprinkle: I hope you're being sarcastic like I was
Kawaii_icybeauti: not actually
I still cant find this

MadSurge: never played that either :$
well im off, cya later
oh dis
You guys know name of this?

twilight_sprinkle: great action game but not very scary :D

Alister: no, they do scare me. not continuosly, but if i dont expect it, the sudennes makes me jump
Was hoping to download it

why pinkie is so cute when she's sad?
00,10dont know
Oh dang.

Why Sumica?
copyright issues probely
oh cool
00,10but that is why I save videos
hey shibaru lol
When I watch something horror, I expect the scary stuff to happen at any time. Horror films don't scare me.
Aw, man.........
don't all you have to say is "This belongs to hasbro?"
twilight_sprinkle: I like more the Silent Hill scares, not zombies going ooga booga from the other side of the room :D
Mike made a playlist for his let's play but he put the videos on backwards xD
00,10some day i should just upload my archive
Woot Tara Strong pops up everywhere! Just reading about the new Metal gear solid. She is giving voice to 'Paz'

well hasbro is fine with us but some arent
*facepalm*
Sumica: Not a bad idea
You see her in lolliop chiansaw massacre?
i knew i should have downloaded the video Ponyfad, but its deleted D:
Sumica: That's a great idea!
ponies!
MadSurge: zombies dont scare me until i start dreaming about them <.< when i was a kid i had 3 straight years of the same nightmare every night
Kawaii_icybeauti Yeah
00,10put a link here
Chat needs more G2
Ponyfad got deleted?
Sumica: :O yeeees! And give the password only to us Bronystaters!
yup

Who's copyright did that violate if not Hasbro's?
FlutterMEDIC: Bye!
stay safe out there FlutterMEDIC
We should stream documentaries in here.
/me is watching College Football
twilight_sprinkle: sorry to hear that. My dreams are like a B movie, only zombies or natural disasters :D
at first i thought this was ttrixie the troll pony
00,10might have been an account closeuer too Kandarihu
I have an idea!
That makes sense.
Sumica: it probably doesnt work for youtube admins though, if they choose to search for it
We should stream Football!
What is the name of this video anyways?
TALKING ASS
MadSurge: lol b-movie dreams :D
sagas: BEST.IDEA.EVAR! THEY SHOULD STREMA GIANT GAMES!
00,10probably not twilight_sprinkle, but they tend to not give fucks about videos unless they are reported
Kawaii_icybeauti: NO! ITS COLLEGE FOOTBALL SEASON!
sagas: NFL is better@
Okay... Enough for me. Good night
THIS VIDEO
when i was about 5 years old my neighbor invited to see a movie called Dawn of the Dead over at his house with his buds (i was not very social at the time so it SOUNDED AWESOME) after we started it i asked why its called that and he said it has Zombies and i asked "whats a zombie?" and he said just watch it so i did. After that i had TO WALK AN ENTIRE MILE HOME IN PITCH BLACK DARKNESS... i was making up excuses
Sumica: yeah but there seems to be an excessive amount of video nuking lately, they might be doing some cleaning up
twilight_sprinkle: I swear, zombie killing spread are fun in a dream :D
dis music is... rather familiar
i must stay awake, i wanna catch gigabit's show :)
Imma watch the let's play part 11 to part 1 8B
00,10yes but those are reported videos
Sumica what is the name of this video?
i have copied my reccent wall
lol
what game is he playing again? i forget
00,10trolls cant report what they cant find
Kabaka, Dash's Determination
I didn't catch the a movie
Sumica: eeyup :D
Katalenic, Dash's Determination
dude failures scares me more then speechs
Sumica: i thought maybe the adsmins were doing the clean ups and searches themselves, idk tho
faliure doesn't really scare me too much...
Failure is not a factory installed option.
00,10admins dont do any investagative work
Kawaii_icybeauti, but this is RD we're speaking
what sucks about failure is its bound to happen
CrimsonPhoenix: Of course.
00,10they just look in to reports
There for, failure is unacceptable.
im what they call a perfectionist
Bunny Must Die
and its a bitch to fail
MadSurge: the one good thing about those 3 years of nightmares is that it gave me lucid dreaming, which was fun after the nightmare ended, i could even wake up at will :P
Chills
everytime
Kawaii_icybeauti: Never!
for me at least
why this reminds me of anime?
twilight_sprinkle: :D
if i was a perfectionist, i woulda died by now. i fail publicly....all the time :)
THIS is a great example of a good PMV
MadSurge: i actually ended the nightmare streak by using lucid dreaming in the nightmare :P
does it involve killing bunnies?
Rainbow-creption
I'm not too much of a perfectionist actualy.
What is the name of the video?
dat ponyfad
0,14liking this song
that big map
twilight_sprinkle: I'm very sensible to light, but noise can't wake me :D
i fail at public things as well but i try to ignore that i fialed and find it as a how do i say success in my own way
Unaacceptable, you fail, you repeat, you keep doing what ever it is until death. If it is irrepearable, you replace it.
dat derpy
12your mom does
everyday I'm derpying
/me hides

You play as a bunny, but with how many times he's died, I guess so XD

Petrified_Discord: the only thing thats bad i my park has been sold so me and my parents are probably moving

Hey GigabitHarmonie, are you playing $20 mode?
Pootis_Spencer: totally
DJ_POn-3: That sucks, man

This is so catchy
Hug him!
Slendy hugs

twilight_sprinkle: You'd be surprised
AAAAH

I wonder what the cost is to produce one MLP episode.
HoodyNinja: no because they cant sing, even if the yDo manage to talk this fast
aaaaghhh my brain is ringing an rattilin

NO MUSIC...........

GigabitHarmonie: now put scary music on

What song is it?
for music
MUFFINS, YUM YUM YUM YUM
Right behind you.
GigabitHarmonie: put the twilight want it need it song
twilight_sprinkle: true, but they are rappers, and rap is a form of poetry, not song
brb
HoodyNinja: poetry? bahahaha....sorry but...bahahaha
So. In this game, do you lose if you encounter Slenderman for too long or too many times?
whooo retro!
http://derpy.me/rW8SE
lesss tango!
/me starts slow dancing
CiderIsForDrinking: behind me there's a closed window .__.
/me dances
twilight_sprinkle: Whats funny about the truth?
lol
ggaay
Polydunami: Only until he catches you.
twilight_sprinkle: Its true, modern rap isn't excactly what you think of when someone mentions poetry, but it still is
why you restart =(
Oh. Kay then
silly slendy
Slenderman has horrible handwriting.
PLAY THE SONG OF DAY!
HoodyNinja: you mean technically?
modern 80s music? neat
SO 80S
<3
im back what happened
GigabitHarmonie: put something scary on
and I really like the concept too
:(
"Let me play for you the song of my people."
twilight_sprinkle: Yeah, technically, though it doesnt matter
so where is Slendy anyway?
Polydunami: He'll start teleporting, as you collect more pages.
Oh my
And in that bog there was a Slenderman.
Polydunami: If you stare at him too long, the game is over.
CrimsonPhoenix: nowhere and everywhere at the same time
he gives you hugs
Slenderman's gay cousin tenderman
Polydunami: I'm not sure what happends when you collect all 8 pages, though.
Daygon: lmao what :D
Daygon: And Splendorman
So what, do you become insane?
Rap isn't all "I be up in da club smoking chemically altered marijuana plants with my female dogs and my gardening tools"
HoodyNinja: well certainly nothing poetic about the lyrics, even if it could technically be classified as poetry...i just generally classify it as saying stupid things with a beat
THIS SONG IS MY JAM
allright leaving now for real, no need to ping me , see y'all tomorrow :)
/me dances like a boss
I believe when you collect 8 pages you have to escape from the foresty thing however I have been told you just die
HoodyNinja: a lot of it is though.
Bye MaxTheBrony
Petrified_Discord: what about artificially sweetened SplendaMan?
Bye MaxTheBrony
u just die
:)
twilight_sprinkle: I only like meaningful rap, with lyrics that mean something

AJIsAwesome: not your fault, cheating AI is cheating
Wirisme: I was 2 at that time. :P
Yeah, the audio and video have desynchronized for me :S
I was 3 :D
Silver_Spoon: The AI cheats on all of them...well maybe except for MK 64 where they can't use Blue Shells
Dem sexy bucking graphics...
JESmith71: this is true
this one was just...egrigious for those of us who got it at release
Refresh worked :3
Im feeling dizzy lol
now to play video games while watching someone play video games
Wirisme: gameception
back in the day... when rainbow road had no walls
11,02^
^^
^^^
Oh yeah, I remember those days :3
snes Rainbow Road was hardcore
^^^^^
back in the day.. Where i didnt existed
c-c-c-c-combo breaker.
spent HOURS trying to get a perfect rainbow road run on time trial
NullRadix: only hours?
I was maybe two years of age when this game was first released :P
/me is playing 3d Land while watchin Mario Kart
Isnt this the mario kart game with the uber cheating ai?
*shrug* at least a day
I was born in 1998 so........fuck........
I still have the original cartridge :3
not sure if days though
SpadeMagnes[R]: yes, yes it is
but they -all- do it
HOP!! SPAM HOP TO TURN BETTER
Hey I hear if you eat Toadstool's mushrooms, you lose weight :3
lol bowser
God damn bowser
You suck
Silver_Spoon: Well they don't really cheat in 64 since they don't shoot Red Shells or use any of the hardcore items
Bowser XDDD
Poor luigi
Whoa that was close
That was close........
Dat Comeback. Hot Damn.
64's the easiest Mario Kart because of that
JESmith71: wasn't there still some rubber-banding going on?
And those two dont even finish
dat buffer
JESmith71 they are a pain in the ass in MK wii and 7
I always found DD to be the easiest.
its all about double dash <3
I honestly like DD over 64, IMO.
TheRandomkid321: There is no buffer.
DS was the easiest
Which rainbow road is the hardest?
Drawing Fate without his hat on... he looks so different...
DD was not so easy
this one >_>
Also, Mario Kart 64 is the only game in the MK series to have its special cup stages available from the start. :P
Spade this one
And I played the HECK out of 64.
dem bucking flying blueshells -.-
Its fucking hard to drift in that one in 7
Also you know whats a bad idea to do in that stage in 7?
Get the drifting boost
/me still needs to get MK 7...........
You fly right off
ah, the feather. so semi-useless
how about mk ds
And bowser still being a noob
same here AJIsAwesome
Move your ass Bowser
Silver_Spoon: That shortuct's about the only use for it
11,02Fuuuuuuuuu

11,02Sumica: Yeah
00,10can tell
11,02Why?
You know whats really bad about 7?
AJIsAwesome: It's better to play with someone else anyway
00,10deinterlaced video
Blues are SUPER COMMON
Spade IFKR
If SuperBrony64 doesn't win this one, he gets silver.........
I got a blue shell in my first mushroom 50cc track
U R ABOUT TO WIN THE FUCKING RACE
It was the first track I did when I first got it
AND SUDDENLY SOMEONE GETS THE BLUE FUCKER
I flipped someone out taking the shortcut once against someone who didn't know about it. He was like "What the...!?" and everyone in the room laughed
I remember rage quitting any time I didn't do it perfectly
ah...my youth
JESmith71: What shortcut?
I am bored
...but I'm totally just a filly...yeah >_>
help me
What MK games had the blue shells that could hit everyone?
64
SpadeMagnes[R]: 64.
AJIsAwesome: That one that SB just did where he used the feather to jump over that pit
JESmith71: Oh yeah, that one.
Didnt 7 do it too?
No seriously...... Dafuq bowser xd
SpadeMagnes[R]: THat shell was BROKEN.
Spade nope
lap'd
YOU LAPPED HIM
11,02Just lapped Bowser :3
YOU FUCKING SUCK BOWSER
wow bowser is bad at this :D
AJIsAwesome: It's even more broken in the later games since it takes your items away
nothing quite like lapping someone in star cup :3
Bowser, close your mouth! You'll catch flies.......
I have to say this
Bowser failed at his own castle...
the 7 item is a clusterfuck
It causes so much chaos
SpadeMagnes[R]: How?
Tom kick Phase4| 13,15testing colours
You get 7 items at once
7 item is kinda useless........
lolwut
SpadeMagnes[R]: 7 items?!:O
can someone make me not-bored?
Those colours. X.x
fml it didnt work -_-
the bot it talks :o
Wait.... DID BERRY PUNCH TALKED?
ples
A red shell, a green shell, a star, a bomb, a blooper, a mushtoom
00,10ow phase
Hi BerryPunch
The 7 item was like... item roulette. you get a BUNCH of items that rotate around you
wanna hang out?
we must give sacrafice to the bot so it doesntr kick us
you "use" whicehver is in front of you when you hit the item again
And other players can steal the items
I think my heart stopped....
and yeah, people can just run into the items
SpadeMagnes[R]: WOw.............
You can actually steal the star and mushrooms
7 item was.... Bad
It is a clusterfuck
I return to nes mariokart?
HoodyNinja: SNES
SpadeMagnes[R]: But at least it helps you overlap people.........
Me gusta
I hink this game was trying to be ahead of it's time.
Also nothing is more humiliating than getting hit by a blue shell and when your about speed up get hit by a bullet bill
Oh hey. I remember this track from double dash :)
Maybe you need to get something replaced?
im gonna say it, no one will agree but i think its the truth, crash team racing was better than mario kart 64

The way the AI chooses the loser is based entirely on what *you* pick
Its sad I abused the Maku Wuhu glitch to get the very best time trial online
What the hell!?
pick bowser: mario is prolly gonna be the "champion"
My desktop was having a lot of BSOD's and random shutdowns and everyone thought I had a virus, but then I took it to school and someone looked at it and told me there weren't enough... pins? and I needed a new power supply and motherboard
http://chzvideogames.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/video-game-memes-blues-shells-are-the-bane-of-my-existence.jpg fucking blue shells
with toad or koopa being the loser
Didn't know Toad could sprout a vine out of a champagne bottle O_O
cachi01|phone: yes
Leastfavorite Mario char?
lol whats a pin?
wii
Daisy
wii everywhere
sm64!
Daisy gives me cancer
I think he meant the connections from the power supply to the motherboard? I dunno
All the games!
I have a sudden urge to own a blue shell plushy. and throw it at people
Hi I'm Daisy
Daisy really needs to be in a non-party game...............
Least? prolly larry
http://www.mariowiki.com/Larry_Koopa
No one will get my reference I bet..
NullRadix: me and some of my co-workers threw angry birds plushies at eachother
Those eggs have hitboxes the size of garbage trucks
& hate hammer bros
meh... angry birds
not really chars tho
SpadeMagnes[R]: pick a mario sprts game, any sports game
I'd say my least favourite Mario character is Bowser Jr.
Spade she was in the movies <_<
tennis
n64
I wonder if you can avoid a blue shell at all
no
there are better games of the same genre than angry birds
I prefer Power Tennis over 64 tennis.
SpadeMagnes[R]: you can in 7 if you have perfect timing and a mushroom
unless you 300cc hex edit
i dont think its that, it was working fine earlier today. my computer was being retarded to i restarted it, and every time i try to go on, it freezes at the desktop lol
SpadeMagnes[R] I once did.
i prefer real tennis :D
I did
SpadeMagnes[R]: Do you have god-like reflexes? then yes you can
it only works in safe mode, but safe mode it retarded
So you can but you have to be fucking precise
luck works, too
oh and Federer is best tennis player of all time. REMEMBER THAT
SpadeMagnes[R]: Use a mushroom when it pauss to go down.
or 300 cc
Angry birds is a piece of shit
twilight_sprinkle: +1 for Reality
OR 30- CC
300CC
Crush the castle ftw

HoodyNinja: Save your money :P
HoodyNinja: how long have you played tf2, cause for some reason mines getting less laggy?

SuperBrony64: Sry brony, i dont got a wii. No pun intended
Ponies47: oh
superretroworld: Not that long, under 20 hours of playtime
recently got it :p
the fighting game logic, more characters = better

I wish I could but that whole bad lag issue keeps me from doing it
all of the yes
....Show of hooves..Who's still in highschool in here?..

I could just use my grandmothers wii, and get brawl again
also, was the new DR who episode any good anyone?

/)
It'd be easier to count the people not in high school
/me knows not to ask dark about that
but then i'd need to unlock all the characters again!
Man, I need to stop hanging around kids. :|
ugh

dari*
Travis Touchdown for next Super Smash Bros. Game.:D
I come on this early and see this

Colt_Silver: Imma kid, gotta problem with it?
Why cant people my age enjoy ponies as wel??!
I'm gonna start doing this from now on
Gotta go! :)

lol
hammertime
Colt_Silver: What's your age range?
la la la~
oh damn
AJIsAwesome: Probably one of the older people on chat...*sigh*
dat 9!
Teh epicness
WE need to recruit more older bronies
Colt_Silver: Like 20's old?
i'm 15
btw i'm 23
Use the boost to get through Derps!
im 21
I'm 18.
my money is on.....mr.game&watch
16
superretroworld: It runs games fine, just that its not a brand spanking new computer, and it does have its bugs, but i love it :)
14 and proud
Wirisme: :D Finally! Someone not in gradeschool!
16
I must be the oldest here...
13 more days till im 15
turning 16 in 3 months
I turn 200 in a few days
why do people give a fuck how old you are?
apparently brony study is full of crap - average age of 21 my hoof
HoodyNinja: well thats good, mines my acer, terrible mistake
octo 31 I will be 17 excited
Age groups tend to get along better,
SpeedyBolt: thinking in non-base 10...I like you already
ugh, dont bring up age, i feel old now
emangamer: Nobody does, we just like to feel seen
Sketch_Toku_Brony: is it just me, or is your name some sort of convoluted Neopets reference?
I'm 30
superretroworld: well the older ones push it further up than we drag it down
HEY d3rb, HOW OLD ARE YOU?
24
You're not old :<
im not getting younger
emangamer: I got nothing against the younger people in chat, its just nice knowing Im around people my own age for a change you know?
I just feel really old in this chat lol
Hot, steamy game and watch on game and watch action!
Colt_Silver: I never said you did, but what I'm asking is, why the hell it matters
He hates ALL the young ones.
why only mr game and watch
Athgaar4: what do you mean?
Colt_Silver no lol im kinda suprised thats still going on :D
I remember seeing an 8 year old in here, and while she was, everyone watched their fucking tongue around her
emangamer: I must've not been in here lol
TENTACLES
emangamer: Well theres this connection thing. Its awkward trying to socialize with people young enough to be your own kids for example.
I would have said as many words as i know
Colt_Silver: not really
emangamer: Well i guess you have to be there.
Colt_Silver: so you cant connect to people when you're 80?
I dont think people here have kids at the age of...20-30
emangamer: Not what I meant.
SpeedyBolt: youd be surprised.
superretroworld: the younger ones that make up the majority are teenage, 3-8 years below 21, but the older ones can be older than 29
emangamer: Not when all we are is just a bunch of floating texts, then you can imagine your talking to anyone, but irl its better to hang around your own age
guess who's back
SpeedyBolt, i got a mate my age with 3 kids
back again
3!!!
Oh my
Gamefreak324: NOT YOU MUTHAFUCKA!
HoodyNinja: that is a falsehood
gamefreak's back
So I WAS wrong.
tell a friend
HoodyNinja: I concur.
one of them is 5 or 6! what the hell!?
XD
MORE TENTACLES
That counter
*breaks down in epic rap*
:3
11,02fuuuuuu
gg
also
11,02gg :)
emangamer: Im speaking genrally here, I get along with all age groups, but thats just me
Athgaar4: to me its 13-18 teenager 19-over adult
is mr game and watch the new fox or something
Whos Dr.Hooves?
HoodyNinja: I don't remember you
some people might not socialize as well as i do
superretroworld: 13-18 = 3-8 years below 21
Gamefreak324: And that is why your not on fire right now
HoodyNinja: age isnt a restrictive aspect to anyone unless you see age as a limiter
so who's streaming?
the only mod who actually plays Wii
Wub
emangamer: I think youre kinda missing the point. But oh well, its not so important.
HoodyNinja: you has confused gamefreaknismness
emangamer: Its not specifically age, more like a maturity aspect
As in, how mature someone thinks you are or how mature they are
Moo ^.^
superretroworld: what I meant is that the ones younger than the average of 21 aren't younger by as many years as the ones over 21 are older
emangamer: then who was playing skylanders a few months ago?
HAX
SBG4 ripping it up with the trashtalk!
Dat cheap Ray Gun kill
Mooo~
HoodyNinja: everyone likes to act immature
nice save
SuperBrony64: friend code? :3
ded
If you acted mature, nobody would really like you.
lol ya want coffee or milk? EITHER
superretroworld: so even though there are fewer older than 21, each one can contribute more to dragging the average up because they can be further from it
superretroworld: Dunno, but unless a new mod has joined, I think if you see a wii game, it's safe to assume it's SB
Derps ftw! XD
ded
lol i wanna play
emangamer: that would mean everyone is still a kid, and we can all get along
Athgaar4: yeah you got a point
who missed me!!!!!!!!
?
HoodyNinja: we can, but some people are just stuck up egotistical jerks
Anyways, the oldest guys here are 21-23. Who said they were that old again?
Gamefreak324: who are you
curry=hax
items=hax
Colt_Silver: I'm 30
items make the game fun
not(no items, fox only, final destination) = hax

Vordox: Dats. Wut. She. Said.
/me is still mad as SB for never playing xbox with him
SuperBrony64 If you do play minecraft I may join you.
Gamefreak324: Nor do I, good sir

SuperBrony64: Should have gone Kirby
morning everypony
lol if only ya got Shadow Moses and did the cdec :D
HoodyNinja: but what about when i first join..... fuck it
Hi NocturnalBlade
Forget Kirby
trying to say anything in chat disconnects me
SuperBrony64: Dude you gotta play ness. Like you gotta.
Ness is where its at.
it's stopped happening now for some reason
Derpy's jacking off in SuperBrony64's face
Eddmario Dafaq?
Eddmario: ....what the fuck?
snake is the most annoying bot
Actually, he shouldve picked the Ice Climbers.
^
11,02Eddmario: Watch the language please
6
SpeedyBolt: No man, Olimar's where its at. <_<
^
SpeedyBolt: But SuperBrony64's not sexist...
>Olimar
was I just kicked/banned or something
Please, Jigglypuff.
11,02If you wouldn't dare say it in public, then it's not welcome here.
SuperBrony64: I would say anything in public
SuperBrony64: Challenge. ACCEPTED>
anything
SuperBrony64: I LOVE MY LITTLE PONIES!
SuperBrony64: HA, hows THAT for not daring to say in public?
SuperBrony64: If I can say it around my dad without getting in trouble, then can I say it here?
MICHEAL JACKSON RAPED ME WHEN I WAS SEVEN!
SB, thats not a particularly wise rule. some poeple would say anything in public. maybe face to face with a little child?
and some people would say nothing in public. it's a guideline, not a rule
Hey kid, I ***** to Applejack.
HoodyNinja: omg u tooo??????
...Would you really say that to an innocent mind?
Gamefreak324: IKR!?
Well this went down the gutter rather quickly.
HoodyNinja: time for sex
/me remembers a tiem where SpeedyBolt would have gotten kicked for that
SpeedyBolt: Do i know the kid?
No.
Colt_Silver: It's BronyState. It IS the gutter...
If Wrek was here....
Then probably
he'd probably start drawing
Wrek would murder us all.
SuperBrony64: *sigh*, could you please just play using Ness so I can get out of here. :/
TheRandomkid321: Wrek IS here
Well, it all depends on who im saying the stuff too
Eddmrio really?
Colt_Silver: NOBODY uses Ness...
Colt_Silver: can you please just quit bugging him and let him do what the fuck he wants
Eddmario: I use Ness.
I DO
TheRandomkid321: See the names on the side?
thank you emangamer
I do wish people would just stop spamming.
Eddmario: My friend will kill EVERYONE with ness
/me hugs Rain <3
Eddmario I thought the mods names where always there
HoodyNinja: Impossible. Ness sucks.
Ness is awesome.
Ness is better than you.
no, they are not there when the mods are not on
Eddmario: BULLshit he abuses ness, and beats me almost every. single. time
HoodyNinja: You suck then.
Dont ask why I use Peach, just dont.
SpeedyBolt: How about Meta-knight?
SpeedyBolt: personally, I'd quit bragging so much if I were you
I dont like Meta Knight, really.
emangamer: calm down buddy.
Well, I love him, but I dont use him often.
Colt_Silver: I dont know you...why are you calling me buddy?
SNAKE SNAKE SNAAAAAAAAAKE
Ice Climbers, either Link, Pikachu, Peach, Bowser, Ike, Marth, Lucario, Mr. GamenWatch are about all im good with
YOUR TAUNT, IS, ANNOYIIIIIING
SpeedyBolt: Because you can time the camera at the right time?
That Snake AI is good..
*MGS2 Colonel voice* Good work Raide- I mean Snake :D
Everything is better during online matches
Colt_Silver: I don't think it's an AI...
Eddmario: ooooh. Ya.
Kirby as well
kirby is OP as fuck
Kirby is OP?
SuperBrony64: Next match you should try and do Snake's secret taunts
HoodyNinja: kirby is OP? really?
To everyone complaining about what is on the stream: Shut the fuck up, or leave.
When I used him
People are complaining?
Im not
Rain ^
a
Oh my, I didn't know people were complaining :S
Jesus I was in a coma-
OH GOD ENTEI
SpeedyBolt: Unlimited flight, and has pretty much everyone's power attack? Definatly OP, which is why he's so fun to use.
awesome I didn't disconnect again
Poly's on!
Eddmario: Falcawn pawnch spam ftw
Eddmario: No, Pit is unlimited flight
3 1 2
WHO SHALL WIN?
Eddmario's on O_O
Just the regular spam about how stream isn't ponies or something related to it.
HoodyNinja: Nope, Pit is NOT
thirty-two is number one
Which reminds me, i kill everyone with Pit
Or what they want.
Polydunami: Did you catch the new Doctor Who episode?
exactly, Ninjazz
and they need to shut up or leave
So SuperBrony64, how about some Ness gameplay?
damn....
I didn't really care to :P
Eddmario: As many jumps as Kirby followed by a flight up special
Thing is, Rain, they never do. :c
he can fly anywhere
Now its just SB64 and the Snake.
Colt_Silver, shut up and just let him do as he wants. :v
I'm usually really good with Kirby, but becuase I hadn't played in MONTHS I'm rusty as fuck.
OMG why is a site called Bronystate not playing ponies 24/7 despite having tried that once and it getting really old quick???? I'm just gunna complain for the next 2 hours
I've seen enough hentai...
and SB64 is the winner.
gg
Rain: Theres no harm in asking. :)
11,02gg :)
gg
Snake? Snake?! SNAAAAKE!! :D
Oh nuts
11,02I'll play one quick one more for Colt_Silver >>
no there isnt, Colt_Silver. but you are not asking. you are spamming.
..
It's not really spamming.
SuperBrony64: ;~; I love you bro.
SuperBrony64: Go after someone's secret taunt next match.
/me chews on RainbowDash90's hair
Hair nomming?
isn't that a disorder
SpeedyBolt: I DON'T HAVE ANY FOOD
no, SpeedyBolt, that is spamming. its continuously asking over and over and over again for the same damn thing.
Seems legit.
Ive been eating hot dog buns for the past 3 days
So, I ate 20 boneless wings at Buffalo Wild Wings in 1 sitting today...
Well, Rain, he could be doing it so obnixously annoying that we'd all be getting mad.
SuperBrony64: XD for a second there....
and then rage would happen.
KFC, Eddmario?
WOuld have eaten more, but my dad "stole" 2 and my jaw had hurt near the end
SpeedyBolt: implying rage isnt already happening
and then there would be cake, lots of Toadstool-made cake.
OKAY
Polydunami: Nope, Buffalo Wild Wings.
dat music is BOOPIN'
Oh :P
Specifically the Sweet BBQ sauce
the rain is now bullets
Dad
Surprisingly, their "mild" sauce isn't that mild...
Y u laugh so loud.
the tickets are now diamonds?
What am I watching?....
Although, I'm gonna get the Buffalo Chicken Wrap next time...
ponies
Colt_Silver: the same thing you've been watching for the past 2- minutes
shouldve grabbed the curry
20*
Sketch_Toku_Brony: The BOOPINEST!
I go for the spice, myself :3
emangamer: theyre just taunting though..Im so confused. :(
ikr Klumzeedragon
Polydunami enjoys spicy food very much :3
Last time I tried eating 24 wings from Buffalo Wild Wings in a single sitting, I did the traditional. BIG mistake, as there's practically no meat on them.
It's easy to understand, Colt_Silver
The friendship lesson here is, be careful what you wish for.
Colt_Silver: well then dont beg for another round and then complain when they are actually having fun, which is what the game is about
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Brohoof for a fellow Groomp. :P
SuperBrony64: HIt yourself with thunder, you turn into a missle
NOW STARSTORM THIS PLACE
emangamer: I never said that. Im just wondering why they were taunting a lot.
Also, if you get the Ultimate Nachos, be prepared to sit in the bathroom most of the night.
A price to pay for Ultimate things.
gg
11,02gg :)
Nights of Bathrooms.
SpeedyBolt: And hurt assholes...
Klumzeedragon /) did ya see the Golden Eye VS? "This game is a bunch of JOHN WAYNES!" *Egoraptor* :D
Ouch!
Indeed.
And with that i must sleep, gn ponies
well, ultimate does mean last
Aww
Bye HoodyNinja
SuperBrony64: *golf clap* Good show ole bean
11,02Moo :3
/me huggy hugs SuperBrony64 \:3/
Holy shit
What is so funny back there :I
THeir ultimate nachos are just tortilla chips COVERED in their chili and their queso dip. So good.
They will not shut the heck up.
speedybolt: who
No, they're dipped in Laxative.
SuperBrony64: Y U NO HAVE INTERNET CHANNEL?
/me hugs Derpy_Hooves back ^-^
Sketch_Toku_Brony: (\ I did! :D Or todays episode? "Oh lets see what the message board says! *insert loud elephant*"
so thats where he lives
11,02Eddmario: I has internet channel on my SD card :<
>Internet Channel
>Despite having a PC
Santa Rosa
It seems all too useless to me. :p
Klumzeedragon: You saw the new episode of Doctor Who? What did you think?
11,02I don't like in Santa Rosa >>;

i put Halo 4 on my x-mas list. I'll also put the MLP toy set that includes a Nightmare Moon toy on there when it gets time to send it out.
well yeah but im waiting for halo 4 dude
we need consoles to be made out of Nintendium...
amped was and call of duty 3 was .. there were others but thats all i know
There are only 2 good Call of Duty games: Modern Warfare and a destroyed one
MW3 is for noob tubers

I've never actually played a kirby game.
Look out
All I know is taht this game has not got the ammount of sucking and blowing I would assume would be in a kirby game.

Games where you gant die arn't fun just agrivating in my opinion.
brb
Torso
mayby go for his talons/
can you absorb the bombs?
like can you eat the bombs and shoot em at em
ah
IN this game, he lost that ability :S
It' not a kirby game at all!

hot wings
Hot Wings

05and basicalyl replied "and i thought they were for little girls"
Oh god
Nice
Has she even watched Mlp?
05nope
00,10so you have now impressed both parents eh wrek
05and thats not in dollars Prick
Wrek: Euros?
05nope
Wrek do you have a DA account or something where you upload your art?
00,10thought I linked it to you yesterday morning Rommulus
I musnt of seen it in my very tired state XD
I just got here, and so I'm wondering what it is that Wrek impressed both his parents with, according to Sumica :<
Wrek: gunna give er shorts? more clothing?
00,10ponies XAX
05Prick: need a body to follow first
XAX, Oh just the fact that his parents thought ponies were for little girls :3
Wrek: ah wait nvm you have the prop
and ohai there
I convinced my sister to watch it
Sumica: Figured that. But was it with an episode? Art? Persuasive argument?
Now she's unstoppable
Wrek: You should have replied that yes you were cause they're so cutsie wootsie~ :D
00,10his art
Ah.
Awesome :D
Hai :)
00,10[03:35] <@Wrek> my mom dropped by asking if im drawing my cuddly ponies again
hi
^^
lol
00,10[03:35] <@Wrek> and basicalyl replied "and i thought they were for little girls"
00,10after seeing Aj there
hey, i gotta question. is the streamer using a mouse or a tablet?
They so cuddly
table
tablet*
No
Hes using a table
Like he said
my folks gave me a MLP pony for my birthday last month, was suppose ta be a joke to em....but i kept it
00,10and as I recall his dad is glad wrek is't drawing just guns and such any more
:o
Wrek: Caravan Palace? <3
05though he did say "did you have to take it to such an extreme when you went from guns etc?" sumi
05also
05this band is awesoem
05you probably never heard of 'em /hipster
05yes its CAravan Palace <3
00,10lol ah ok
swing baby!
00,10I thought he was cool with it
05he is
05but he still found it to be one extreme to the other xD
00,10ah gotcha
00,10so the happy middle is ponies with guns =p
05so whats on stream right now could be called the equilibrium of both
i gotta find more artist that are maybe similar to parov stelar i just love that swing with a beat
00,10inb4 wrek makes another drawfriend with this one
Wrek: I love your great taste in music. It's pretty much the same as mine. :D Ranging from the Metal, Swing, and Electronica. I have to say you're the streamer with the best musical taste. :P
05Sumica: its not even shaded and is already looking fabulous
Wrek: marvelous*
And everything Wrek does looks fabulous. :)
00,10you do know you made today drawfriend yes wrek>
00,10and the day before
05damn
05that guy can scat
00,10http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/09/drawfriend-stuff-551.html check number 14
05what?

Dayum
so since i got banned for asking this earlier and still never got a good answer
who in the bloody hell is rinachan?
05"#14 Why did I look? "
05lol'd
00,10Buytoast, a VA. Does Twi's voice in alot of fan works
05ah so THATS why i spiked away about 30 watchers in a day :|
00,10has done alot of stuff on Newgrounds as well and some game called "skullgirls" iirc
ah
00,10hey wrek "#14. That's not really what is meant by adult education "
ah the great wonders of Newgrounds :)
05ofc it is..
00,10"do ponies have belly buttons?"
yes
If Wrek drew one, then yes! :P
00,10#14 Aw, man, it looks like I failed my paper again! I totally didn't fail it on purpose to get "detention"
Sumica: I did though. ;)
may wanna study up on Animal Anatomy
05bellybutton logic: is it a mammal?
00,10I bet if you get Aj done here today she will be posted up as well
Wait How do ponies get bon in mlp?
born*
Magic
"Whenever someone calls me ugly, I get super sad and hug them, because I know how tough life is for the visually impaired."
Then I guess not
00,10oh hold on I have a link for that
really you wanna get there, their Horses so just imagion a horse giving birth
I'd rather not XD
Sumica... Im afraid to know how you got a link for that. :D
oh my... i've entered to a clop conversation
I'm okay with this.
Funny how these things pan out...
Accidentally_Octavia: IKR
well sorry if it grosses you out, i had to learn that stuff and know it so i can successfully become a vet
05the light at the end of the tunnel
00,10gonna post a video link now, the horror
05is jsut your next motehrs vagina
00,10http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZkZb589HrI
Wrek: wat?
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Flare: faust posted in a DA comment that they get born via good ol mammalian reproduction
Wrek: ...mother of god
Ok
oh holy shit you've exposed us to the danger zone son
00,10watch that and you will know where ponies come from
But Rainbow dash didn't seem to have one
Wrek: Oh sweet Celestia!
buckle up
Sumica: i shouldnt have clicked that
So I guess they get born somehow a little different from us
Sumica: i REEEEAAALLY shouldnt have
00,10go to around 4 min in
Why can't I look away from it?!
Brb, deleting history.
Flare: how would mammallian reproduction inply any difference from us? you now what ammammal is, right?
Yes
Sumica: i dont want to, but i must watch it. to prove my streangth and honor kmy fami- OH DEAR GOD WHAT ARE THEY DOING
I'm just saying that I saw Rainbow Dash without a belly button so...
00,10you know they are covered in fur right Flare?
i've never hated rainbow dash but... well...
So.... Babies come from rainbows?
00,10exactly
Sumica... Never show that to anyone... ever... again...
00,10but only double rainbows
You got a point Sumica
if they show bellybuttons on MLP the age rating would go up
00,10crash
^
Sumica: That was touching and magical.
Prick: Lol'd. True, though...
that was torture
yet i enjoyed it slightly
It was painful
i dont know why
00,10and just think that is just one ep
And normally Sweetie Belle is awesome....
So does Dragon Porn Daily just go around looking for art to use in their drawfiends or do they at least need to ask
00,10I have links for many many more eps
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
DONT DO IT
00,10they dont ask
Buytoast: I had no idea such a website existed...
ohlook
aka equestria daily
00,10they just hit up poniebooru and now derpybooru
and they don't?
OH!
someone who shares my disdain for eqd
AHAHA
00,10if you check the recent post on derpybooru before drawfriends are posted
http://derpy.me/bpFeo
i dont hate Eqd i just really, really, really, really dislike it
00,10you will see like all of the same art
I just hate it, Flyboy
whyfor?
this song :)
What's with all the hate for EqD?
that's shameful
00,10well for one he protects his cash cow and will out right blacklist any thing that might threaten his abilty to make cash from it
who? lord Dragon Fucker of Trixieshire?
Morning guys :)
don't know who dat is, probably serves lemonade
00,10eeee yup
boy oh boy sethisto
you are a sad strange little thing
05this was a nice song
05added to faves
00,10he quit school and work to run the site
whats with all the hate on dragon-fucking?
wait
he did?
00,10mmmhmm
oh wow
that's a new level of pathetic
I love Caravan Palace and Wrek's drawings, but I can't stay up any longer. x.X So tired.
I feel really depressed. Basically i'm not even sure if I am making the right decisions in life. I suddenly realise I am no more than a small puppet. Destined to die. I won't be remembered for any longer than 1 or 2 generations after I die. I wonder if I still feel entertained by MLP anymore. I look over at my MLP set I got a couple of days ago and know my father will say it's a waste of money despite the fact that he wasted
o-o
^not reading that
00,10Flyboy, he has a thing for some female dragon from the spyro games
Prick I never asked you to
welcome to reality kid
Buytoast: if someone has a hobby, its their choice of what to do with that hobby. not anyone elses. so dont hate someone for thier hobbys, whatever they do with them
00,10it's not a hobby for him any more Flyboy
Hey everypony!
I'm back :)
Sumica: so? its not your choice what he does
Flare: alrith were in public *still shaking*
Welcome back Flare
it's his precious
00,10when it became his job eqd started showing favortisim to thigns that can bring in more incom
Thanks you
well im sorry my friend i dont read paragraphs, i only read a summerized sentence or quote....or otherwise its useless knowledge
fluttershy: Don't worry they wont bite :D
Sumica: thats called economy
So basically you're all bashing someone who quit school and makes money from his own website?
Its not really knowledge...
Its something he just wanted to say
He sit's upon his Equestria Daily throne, stroking his Ring of Draconus Dildous, lusting for ultimate power
Sumica: he needs money, so he can find a fun way to earn it. easy
00,10it's not his website it's a blogger
Huh? Eqd runs on blogger?
Jobs...there nowhere...for now
geez art is long i dont think i should make one.............actually mabye a should
wow Wrek that looks awesome
hey what happend to the blade thing on his hoof
her*
Hidden layer, I suppose.
He hidit so he could work on her leg
00,10the sword is on another layer
You get one chanch. One mere chanch at life. Every step can mean your last one on two legs. I have come to the realisation that I have near all the information man has ever known at my fingertips. Yet I waste it looking at stuff that "entertains" me. I sit here infront of my computer. Wasting my life. I could die tomorrow and what would I have to show I ever walked this earth. A mesely gravestone that my family could probably
00,10he turned the layer off to detal the glove
why would you waste money on a gravestone
TheRandomkid321 I know what you mean
00,10not sure if you are quoteing or venting TheRandomkid321
you could get a small rock or something with your name written on it
so he/she remember - derp
be remembered*
Sumica venting.
I mean I for particular haven't done anything that might extend the human edge or tat's inspiring
hell, get two piece of wood
that's*
and you have a cross or something
http://derpy.me/sgCyi
Your attitude is amazing, guys.
You alway spend too much time thinking about death so you waste your life.
oh hey, is this fort knox?
Flyboy: um the rules are no video's during stream
flutterchu: what they dont know, wont hurt them
there is a german beer commercial with this song
I'm not depressed or anything but I know that my life wont matter even if I try, all thigns will com to an end.
hello
i remember this song
i spend my time watching Bronystate, hanging with friends, playing WoW or TF2, help family....i think ill die happy
If life were a game I would've already played the story line about 1000 times
these annoying little bastards back in my vidya games club spammed this song every damn meeting
but even so I try to create new things
So don't worry to much about it :)
Buytoast: must be one ell of a song
In a few years I shall be on my own. Needing to worry about bills and my job. I am on the verge of ending my life now when I live in basic luxery. I have no skills though. I cant draw, dance, sing, play sports, do ANYTHING taht requires coordination, nd cooperate.
i think they just thought the music video was LE SO RANDUM
Malavolent: :) I don't feel that way. I enjoy everything I do. Wether it be for friends or strangers, I put my needs last and it makes me like a decent person.
i know a few contradiction's in the show itself
00,10heh, trying to hide a youtube link
TheRandomkid321, is this what has been depressing you the past few days? :/
BANNU TIME?
one way to avoid depressed death, Don't think about it just keep moving/trotting forward.
Sumica who was doing this?
im afraid of living on my own
AdamTheDuck pretty much.
Just keep in mind why you should live on forward
living on your own is spectacular
nobody around to bother you
it's so quiet and you can have the house freezing if you want it
i never get bothere in my room though ;_;
TheRandomkid321: dont worry i had worse i cant even fly even tohugh i have wings
if you let it control you, your just another fool that shot themself and not know the meaning of life...Moving Foward is you Future the past is forever gone.
flutterchu of for the love of god. Sorry but I would appreciate it if you pulled your head out of that fantasie realm this isnt a roleplay room.
Klumzeedragon: That's the way. I don't care what happens after I die, since I won't be able to change it. I've got my goals to achive and I don't have time to waste thinking about negative stuff.
05steampunk inspiration is suprisingly hard to come by
TheRandomkid321: aiight *still shaking*
Wrek, how about some steampunk MLP music? :P
Anyway, I think Wrek has done a marvellous job so far
bloody ell this was all a rp...boy didnt i get trolled
Prick what do you mean? I'm not RPing
...meh
Prick is confused.
Malavolent: Exactly? Why think about the negative when it's just going to make you feel crappy. :) Getting out and just doing what I love makes me feel great. If I start to feel down or anything, the best thing that I can do is go out with music and walk through the neighboorhood. Simply, relaxing and wonderful.
He hurts himself in confusion.
Exactly!**
it was super effective
Klumzeedragon: I completely agree with you.
used confusion Prick
is now immune to confusion
Pricks Prick with a prick.
FINALLY THE STORM STOPPED!!!!!!!!!!!!!:$ *stop's shaking*
hey dont used evil words
yay
try using it as a name
Has the school already started at your place, guys?
tomorrow for me
Same here.
4 days for me
:)
Malavolent: i cant fly so i cant go to flight school
3rd of Sept when the children rise to learn
I cant help but think about how mankind, although we think of ourselfs as the strongest force on earth, are merely puppets to the force that is nature. All there needs to be is one natural desease and the whole earth could be wiped out. All our great structure would crumble. The streets would be filled with chaos, the few survivors would probably be insane cannibals, nature can and probably will destroy us eventually. We are
I think school has, but I didnt sign up for any college classes this semester. :P I'm more focused on trying to get a job.
ENOUGH WITH THE PHILOSOPHY!
Prick: Depends on where do you live. Some schools in the US start sooner/later.
TheRandomKid321 We dicide what we do in our lives, many have forgotten that. We're just being supressed by the NORMS
TheRandomkid321: Its best not to think about...dont worry the Reapers will be coming in the next 38,000 yrs
i wish my wings will flap someday
Malavolent: I live up north
Prick: North of the US?
I say do whatever you want
AdamtheDuck I appreciate your humour but, alas, I am in no mood.
Malavolent: ja
i wonder how big the word document he's copy pasting from is
Prick: So basically Canada :D
Ok then TheRandomkid321... I'm just usually in a cheery mood most of the time. :/
Buytoast I am honoured you think I am plagarising this. I truly am.
Malavolent: close but no
i didn't say you're plagarising it
i said you're copy pasting from some word document
be right back, I'm getting somthing to drink
Buytoast Oh, well I am not. I am merely saying what comes to my head
Prick: Close enough for me. Never been that good in geography :D
Flare: i can only drink sink water all that's in the frige is beer
Wrek: i wanna see that leg prop again :)
TheRandomkid321: Man, the way to look at it is that it's out of our hooves. We can't stop something like that if that's what decides to happen. So we deal with it when it comes. The weak will die, the strong will flourish, and those who stick together will flourish. We do what we must and we have to enjoy what we got while we have it.
I know you people probably see me as spamming but I am merely discussing the source of my depression that I have regretfully taken out on you for a few days.
Wrek: very well done, do you think on making another steampunk animatronic
And that's all I'm saying about this. I font want to flood the wall of text anymore.
HELLOOOOOO BRONYSTATE!!! Did ya miss me?
hello one
And I'm back as well
Hello there One I dont believe we have had the pleasure of meeting until now
Welcome back Flare
One: I haven't met you. :) But hello and welcome back!
Hello One
thanks
Well then, Rommulus, nice to meet you. And you too Klumzeedragon.
I'm excited to see season 3
If Only I had the artistic talents wrek does. Or a similar talent. Or any talent at all.
I actually thoroughly enjoy this song Wrek what is it?
Wish I knew.
i hate how they will have 13 episode's that are an hour long
i am waiting patiently for that leg to finish...
flutterchu, then again. ONE HOUR LONG.
It's not that bad
TheRandomkid321: You. Like me just have yet to find it mate. But I dont let it get to me. You shouldnt either. You'll find something someday. Just never lose sight of who you are. :)
At least we have them ponies.
I think they should feature a pony that makes chocolate
Klumzeedragon: Yep. I for one have found a passion for the pianah.
or is addicted to it :p
Flare: Tense.
One: How long have you been playing? :)
I love the sound of the piano and I have for the longest wanted to play one however I have had no such luck with finding one.
Hello Bronystate! :$ I see badass AJ, viva Wrek!
my brother deont hit me he just hugs me in a special way that i dont understand http://asksweetiepoo.tumblr.com/image/10042475646
Greetings MadSurge
MadSurge: Greetings and Salutations!
So what are you ponies up to?
WELL, Klumzeedragon, about a year and a half is when I stated actually playing. I gingerly played around before that time, then realized how nice it sounds.
Oh oh oh Is there a site where we could like, tell the staff of my little pony our ideas
is there?
Just relaxing and listening to the fantastic musical choices of Wrek.
05how about some...
MadSurge: you do know we're not ponies, right?
MadSurge: Listening to awesome music and philosophical discussions have just ended.
05lets see
Hello there MadSurge, just admirin' wrek's art and listening to wonderful music.
Inb4 metal.
did somthing happen
05havent listened to heavy techno in ages
Agreed
Can you like do that?
Prick: What else could you be? Humans? :D
Heavy techno ey?
There is such thing as a heavy techno?
*CHK CHK* Lock and Load, bronies. Here comes the Drums!
This will be interesting.
Indeed
MadSurge: no i am a person, but we all are Humanoids
05ok got some techno queued
Wrek: I will enjoy almost anything you play. I havent seen you play anything bad yet. :P
05after that
05some calssics
Why do you have that name, Prick?
One: guess
I completely agree Klumzeedragon.
Prick: Damn.
maybe cuz im Lovable :3
When you say classics how classical are we talking? as in Motzart and Beethoven classics?
Is there any chance that you can tell mlp staff idead for an episode?
ROCKtavia of course.
ideas*
One: Oh? Well that's good! Do you play shows or just play around on a personal piano?
oh my...we can do a duet i can always get my violin
Klumzeedragon: I have humongous stage fright, so I keep it to myself.
I guess not
Rommulus: Im glad that I'm not the only one who loves Wreks music choices. :D
PENDUMLUM!!!
Wrek you should make like a little support for the blade
Blood Suger?
Fasten your seatbelts.
I have gone full relaxation mode right now
Must not mention tiarawhy...
One: Aw. As long as you have fun playing, I suppose that's all that matters. :) Sharing a talent like that is always nice though. I have a friend that plays a lot of piano.
One: tiarawhy...im pretty sure everyone seen it
Klumzeedragon. That is so nice of you.
i need to leave now THANK YOU EVERYPONY
bye
Sadly, Prick.
One: oh now you think about it...thank you One
Bye, Flare.
Bye flutterchu
Bye Flutterchu!
not me fluttershu :)
bye
Have a good one
Ohhhh...
Whooops.
If anypony needs me I'll be drawning abit myself
If you wonder why I have been silent I ahve been sitting here pondering. Wondering just why I was placed on this earth. If there is even a reason. What if I am in a comatised state and all this is just a dream. What if this is an afterlife. And when we die we merely move onto the next one.
just mention my name when you need me
If anyone nees me, I'll be walking into Mordor.
I bet you made that name simply for that joke.
One does not simply walk into Mordor
haha :p
Buytoast: Touché. Actually, I did NOT.
Wrek: I was thinking about where I've heard this from... and now it hit me. :S
Buytoast: I wanted to do "One Trick Scotsman" Buuuut. Appearently I need underscores instead.
05oh? where from Klumzeedragon?
Klumzeedragon where?
Wrek: ah ha! its a Rapier!
Rapiers Rock.
I feel like a rapier really doesnt fit in with the steampunk style however I do adore rapiers so I am torn
But I think it's a cutlass.
Some r34 Chrysalis thing. It was on 4chans flash. X.x Just brought back the visions with that song.
This sort of reminds me of the Imperial Guard from Warhammer 40k
Klumzee!!! WHY?! WHYYY?!
XD
05love this song
that and does anyone know what the name of that hat is called?
Klumzeedragon: oh you mean Chrysalis with Pinkie Pie and Twilight :O oh ya that was funny
Is anyone getting agrivated by me posting these "walls of text" some may call them?
AdamTheDuck: Officer's hat. I'm not sure if has an official name.
Because I can stop
not really doesnt mind me I dont know about the others however
brb
One: Cause 4chan is evil and doesnt have room for proper title videos. :D And aye Prick. That's the one. :P
Hello!
Nice support Wrek
looks awesome
I feel like I get SWALLOWED up by text. In the vacuum. Where nopony hears me scream. That's why I wanna be a picture perfect pony.
Ho GentleHeaven
Hi*
Oh damn One, oh damn!
One: That fluidity.
Heya everypony.
anyone know what happened to paintchat?
Hi Zanon
No Idea
we burned it
Oh me!
be right back
oh, shame... i really liked it
Wrek: can you tilt the blade a bit
why tilt?
if thats what ur asking
Wrek: How long are you going to stream? Debating on sleeping and just using your streamed music as my lullabys.
Shit... I have earplugs on. That bass is busting my brain. AND I LIKE IT.
I am glad Wrek is streaming earlier then yesterday because for me I was up at 2am watching, thankfully now its only 9:49pm
if you tilt a blade towards light it flickers and makes it look less fat
oh I get what you mean
Prick knows a thing or two about ZE MAGICKS of art.
but i dont think you can put 3D modeling in a 2D picture
Its just really the illusions of 3d
otherwise its just fine the way it is
done by the manipulation of highlights and lowlights
I don't have awesome speakers or headphones. Best pair of headphones I got is a $40 pair of turtle bitches. :D Don't do anything justice.
WELL! *crack knuckles* I'm goin' to Omegle. Gonna do improvs and Brony hunts. CATCH ALL OF YOU LATER!!!
I have $100 Turtle beaches however they are of course made for gaming so they dont have very good bass etc not good for music sadly
Rommulus: Lucky... It's 4:52am for me.
i like to see thing visually ahead but i cant, i have to move it to that point to where its at, if i dont like it I move it back and redo it, but i can think ahead but not visually
Ouch
I have been sitting here thinking and I have come to no conclusion besides what I was at at first... we are nothing... mankind is nothing... the meaning on life? Non existant... we live, we die, we rot. There is no afterlife, no second chanches. Although you have one chanch to make a temporary dent in history. Bujt it eventualy will be wiped out with the human race.
you doing anything important well I guess it would be today for you so you doing anything important today?
You have been doing a lot of thinking lately TheRandomkid321
Why not sit and take a rest and enjoy life instead. :)
AdamTheDuck of course. It is what the human brain was created to do is it not?
/me hugs TheRandomkid321, Rommulus, Prick, Flare, Wreck, AdamTheDuck and Wrek. Bye!
/me licks One
Why does everyone taste like a rainbow?
/me Hugs one
Because Rainbows taste awesome and we are all awesome
This is so cool
I'll be back later.
I like this song espedcially the beat
Bye One
Rommulus: Yeah. I guess thats the same thing with these. They sound fine, but they have no bass. And yeah, ouch is right. :P Cause I'll probably be woken up at 9:30am - 10am.
I have no idea how you do this stuff
another i like ta see is an illusion in a 2D photo
AdamTheDuck Enjoy life? Yes, I suppose one could do that. Or they could attempt to make the world a better place for the later inhabitants. We may even be able to post pone our destoned end.
Geeze Klumzeadragon, I would say go to bed if it wasnt for the amazing art and music going on
BUZZ LOOK AN ALIEN!
Rommulus: But no, nothing important. Chores. Maybe a beach party. And being woken up super early. I don't know what's more valuable~ :O
However TheRandomKid321 why cant one enjoy ones self by making the world a better place?
One does enjoy refering oneself as one. :$
Awesome then you are good to stay up if you want XD
Rommulus every time you enjoy yourself. Every second you do so. Could have a major impact on your accomplishments.
Dat cutie mark
well im off to Wonderland, once Wrek finish this I might use this for my next wallpaper
Bye Prick, say hello to Cheshire for me
TheRandomkid321: But if we only have one chance, then we need to make the absolute most of that chance. :) Why say "Only one chance, so fuck it." why not, "Only one chance? Fuck it, I'll do everything I can to make it worth it!". But of course you don't know if there
Work and life does not have to be one giant arguise journey filled with hardships and pain take africa for example and volunteering, people volunteering to help the poor dont have to look at it as a chore or a pain they could see it as a fun adventure of helping the world and through this feel proud that they are doing so and through this feel happiness to help
TheRandomkid321: is nothing afterwords or if it keeps going.
happiness does not hinder us it makes us world harder and looking a life through such a funnel of bleakness does nothing but depress us and make us want to stay inside and craddle ourselves away from the pain
Happiness is what keeps us driving forward and moving toward a better future, in science, in medicine, in art and in all other fields of life
Apologies for text walls
i cant believe you havent been auto kicked for spam, nicely done :D
Sophisticated talks over the internet come rarely in this day and age. :3
TheRandomkid321: I think you got your point across well. :)
I understand where you come from but what I have come across shal haunt me to my end... Mankind is nothing.... Everything we build will oneday be in ruin.... In this day of age we have created stuff to make lives longer but also inventions taht could potentialy end the world as we know it.
I agree D3rb XD
That was for Rommulus. :P
05thsi is pinkamenas themesong..
This is what wrek's drawing reminded me of http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb58378/warhammer40k/images/4/45/Company_Command_Squad.jpg
AJ would look good in a coat like that :$
/me opens IRC again and reads all the talk about life and happiness
Damn it's srs in here :o
Internet is srs business
:P
some kid is bitching about life and crap
nothing really serious
^
I see, Buytoast.
Back
and welcome back Flare
I have also come across many things that have and will continue to haunt me in my dreams and in my wake if I ever let them in and give way to the sorrow and pain however I refuse to let it in and I persurvere into a better tomorrow because I know yes we have made things to make us live longer and things to kill eachother however the things that kill eachother also stop us from using them and stop others from making us use t
thanks you
TheRandomkid321: Aye. But you know what. That's our own damn fault. We build and we take care of what we build. When we die the next generation steps in and takes care of it as a gift, or they remove it and make something better. Progress. We keep moving forard.
/me trouts Jmo with a large slap!
Please use a private party when you're discussing somthing phillosific
XAX
bronystatwe can be deep cant it?
I really can't be bothered to awnser all of the questions nor read them :(
philiosofical is the word you're looking for
I will get SB onto you bro.
Jmo: D:
Wrek: But yes. Happy Pink Nightmares. :D Definitely Pinkamina material.
I know I'm not from the U.S or U.K
AJ moustache?
I live in Belgium
Jmo: You wouldnt :o
oh belgium, great electronic music has come out of that country
I guess I'm the only one who lives in Belgium
Really?
Think of it also this way, the nuclear bomb we have thousands upon thousands in the world and due to this threat we do not drop them, yes we have the fear of them but because of them there hasnt been a war for around 41 years or so now, the world is actually a better place due to that bomb and Im not saying its good that we can destroy on such a large scale I am saying because of it be have learned not to use them at all.
yeah really Flare
Also Jmo, anything else to report about the Steam skin?
Well I made a vew songs on my previous youtube account
But it got deleted for copyright or somthing
I made the songs myself...
I have come to the conclusion that with my report cards even though I try my hardest I am still failing. I believe my fate is sealed. I shall be another speck of dust on this floor we call earth. I shant be remembered by many. My fate won't be for a good cause. Not to mention if one of the other sperm was to fertalise my mothers egg they could have been much more than me.
I'm aware of the ingame chat text not having the blue highlight, making it hard to read. I'll fix that soon. Anything else?
I didn't even copy anything
XAX, I'm not using any skins. They're all broken until the community comes out of beta.
My corpse shall rot in the ground.
Wrek: Is that going to be a robotic Weenona?
Dude, Bill gates dropped out of highschool and in 2008 and 2009 he was the richest man in the world
Jmo: Hmm... I'm using it.
All your community tabs are working?
Friends/profile/Game Hubs/Workshop
@All ponies who are discussing imprtant matter such as phillosophie. Mankind is being supressed. You can do whatever you want
I need to go eat now
bye
Bye Flare
again
Bye Flare
I don't know, I never really liked this band... :S
I shant become famouse. I shant be a scientist who discovers a cure for cancer. I shant create a time machine. I shant grant dreams.
Jmo: ._. I'm still using the old version. Store/Library/something :|/Community
Ah
I'm using the new one lel
I see.
I am a 13 year old male whos strength is rivaled by taht of a 10 year old girl.
You can grant dreams because even the smallest speck of sand can become a beautiful shining pearl with time
it is not the scale of what you do something it is how the simplist things can affect even one person in the biggest of ways
Huh. When I left the stream yesterday this drawing was being made.
TheRandomkid321, you have a perculiar way of talking and wide vocabulary compared to others to your generation :3
Glad to know not all hope is lost for humanity.
such as for me on a personal scale I feel as if I will remember this moment for a very long time because of Wrek, talking with friends, listening to great music made by simple people and watching amazing art being made right infront of me
TheRandomkid321: Everyone will rot in the ground. Some though, aren't that lucky. :/ And that's the thing, you're 13. You have so much you haven't seen or done. It can only get better from there. And you really don't know if any other sperm would have been better than you. So stop that.
Strength does not = importance
AdamTheDuck of course. I never go on facebook because of all these people who I used to know from primary school using horrid grammar and simple words like they are 7 years of age.
look at albert Einstein he was a weak man however he is remembered even to this day
Heil Grammar! :P
AdamTheDuck: I was going to say I talked like that on the net when I was 13, but then I remembered I was actually a textlanguagefag :<
Just like Motzart
TheRandomkid321: Look at that. AdamTheDuck see's something in you. With grammar and knowledge like that, you can be a fantastic writer. :)
I agree
Sometimes all it takes is practice and a bit of initiative
and a little enjoyment.
Always look on the bright side of life~
this is making me want to learn to draw
any one of us in this chat could be the next great artist, musician, revolutionist, scientist, writer, sculptor.
AdamTheDuck when you know as much as I know that isn't easy.
it could always be worse, make the most of what you got
Random do tell what is so horrifying that could cause such bleackness in ones self?
TheRandomkid321, it isn't knowledge that makes a man, it is how persistant you can be.
is mr dark and edgy still copy pasting his essay?
people with less than you have achived alot, no excuses, gotta just go for it
AdamTheDuck I am 13 and I know many MANY fact about how war is. How much suffering there is in the world.
Wow that is really looking great Wrek.
AdamtheDuck and many other things that would haunt anyone my age.
Do tell Random what are these other things
oh god
this is funny shit
Buytoast what is?
you
let me play you a ballad
TheRandomkid321: Which everyone learns about eventually. :/ It's only harder for you because you're young. Pretty much you're just angsting so hard right now.
CRAAAAAAWLING IIIIIIIIN MY SKIIIIIIIIIIIIN
Buytoast and you obviously have a limited vocabulary for you swear in a basic sentence.
/me grabs a chair and popcorn
oh man, mr i have a dictionary saying that my limited vocabulary means that my point is less valid
Nothin' wrong in being a Sweetie Belle. :/
Buytoast well i'm pretty sure I have supirior intellect. I do not insult people who are crying every night.
I can't wait for wrek to do the eyes :)
boy, i should really get that router fixed
Whats wrong with the router?
Wya re there two Buytoasts?
*Why
*are
I feel so inspired :D
can never have enough toast
because my connection is shitty sometimes
Dat shading. :) Looking great Wrek.
Wrek does have that effect on people Wirisme :D
:| I still cant get into my Uru live account - Darn system doesn't recognize my name
Just keep trying Cypress it will work eventually ^.^
if not ive it some time and try again
Shake your fist at it angrily and demand it let you in cause you're great and powerful.
Cypresswolf: Solution: Use duct tape. :P
This song is making me cry :'(
I cant remember my password for it - they cant send it to me because they have no record of my name or email
ouch
been trying since friday to get in
Just keep trying different passwords you have used in the past then
then use more duct tape. Problem solved :P
or try contact their help system and explain your predicament
Back!

I tasted dillecious :3

If I would be able to purr I would Klumzeedragon
Zoidberg used dodge, it was super effective.
How can a dodge me extra eefecive :p?
effective* :s
You dodge with style

Oppa Gundam style that is
*scratches behind Flares ear* If I can purr, you can purr~ ;)
I need to go to bed now...

;)
he's too dark and edgy to need goodbyes
^w^
Oh well he is going through puberty, emotions run high at that point in time
Buytoast2 apparantly so. But everyone has a bad day now and then.
Wrek your drawning is really nice :)
Klumzeedragon, only his is more like a bad week :/
dat wavy hair gone +(
=(*
i'm just dissapointed i couldn't link him "Crawling" by Linkin Pak
:'(
Wait
AdamTheDuck: Aye. But with all the stuff on his mind, it's no surprise.
Buytoast2: thatfeel
Wrek?
Doesn't AppleJack have like a ponytail on her mane?
Buytoast2: You could have always sent him a link via private chat. 6_9
I dont think Wrek can see the chat, just a guess though probably got sai on fullscreen
Flare, Yeah but wavy hair = 20% more badassness
AdamTheDuck, you're right, just mentioning it :)
Did I miss someone being moody?
looks cool
Yes
MadSurge: I thought you were here for some of it. :D
Klumzeedragon: I'm looking at tons of other stuff :D
Flare: *plays with his ears* :)
TheRandomEmo was crying about life being unfair or something
ahh
No not unfair, just more pointless iirc
05its on a separate screen
oh he's redoing her hair
05and sometimes i cba to look right
He was sad about how the world is crap at the start then went onto say how he did not think he could make a difference in the world because he is failing all his classes and that he would amount to nothing.
whatever it was
Also thats pritty awesome Wrek
yes it is
MadSurge: Ah makes sense then. :P
AdamTheDuck: BIG DEAL. Life itself is pointless, so why not have some fun in the meantime? :D
05whelp
05metal anyone? :D

MadSurge, That's pretty much what I've been trying to get across to him :D
Wrek: YESH
Yes metal :D

Cypresswolf: Congrats by the way. :P

Applejack stares into your soul. :(
Wirisme: What's so funny about Alestorm? ;O

AdamTheDuck: Nah, she just has control of the elements this time. :O

Wirisme: They sure are! :) I've seen them in concert once too. The had a man in a bear suit dance on stage with them.

Welcome back Rommulus~
ye they're epic
I wish I could of seen how Wrek did them just wow.
mabby he'll put it on youtube?
:o
I hope so
Rommulus: Lines~ ;)

Ohai :)
Hello MaxTheBrony
Wrek's eyes are just awesome <3
that looks amazing Wrek :D
I could of never guess Klumzeadragon<_<
MaxTheBrony: Howdy~ :)
Hi MaxTheBrony
Rommulus: I just guessed! >_>
MaxTheBrony: Needs more Spok.
Hello Everypony :)
Hello BronyInstrumental
heya BronyInstrumental
Spock xD?
Hello BronyInstrumental
MaxTheBrony maby you should give him more then 2 legs it looks a bit two dimmencial :)
But I like the rest
Ah true
Steampunk Ponies? nice! :D
One part caught my attention Max, on the stomach I guess you can call it, there is the basic light and then the highlight ontop of that and I feel like you got it right with the basic highlight but not with that main highlight if you know what I mean
:o
hmm il try figure out what you mean :P
MaxTheBrony: And you may need to show the other arm coming from behind the head, otherwise it looks like he only has the one arm.
Let me explain better you got the hair colour which is the darker brown then you have the light blue which is the basic highlight and then the really light blue which is the main highlight
I feel like it shouldnt have the really light blue (main highlight) on the stomach if the light is coming from directly behind the centaur
however having the basic highlight there is all good
just my opinion
Ahh
I see waht you mean
what*
yeah that sounds reasonalbe
thats all I can pick out from it
ble*
Thank you :)
Rommulus: .-. the lighting is on it's back.
Rofl MaxTheBrony
:P?
Needs more messages

?
does Wrek tries Steampunk style?
CrimsonPhoenix what derpy animation project? What does it include?
does wrek tries?
Flare, it's a bunch of mini-skit involving Derpy and her misadventure
I think you just accidentally the whole grammar there, CrimsonPhoenix
the thing about it is that he'll be soing the whole video in pen and paper
So basicly you could make an animation about derpy and her misadventures?
05the steampunk prosthetic is growign on me
Hell yeah Steampunk

I only came in around midway through the euronight, 'cause I was here during us night
The epicness is overflowing
but- I didn't see it
I showed up at the meetup and I was the only one there aside from the guy oganizing the event
Awww
So it was just the two of us
We met at an arcade and still had plenty of fun though
Had fun anyway?
aah hehe

So I wasn't the only one on a meetup yesteray eh? XD
Wow
Wrek that looks awesome
I live that Steampunk leg
So I'm not allowed to chare any kind of link right?

I thought pics were allowed, but it always depends on the mods
oh ok
... I have a stupid question :/
Lil_B: I'm pretty sure pics are allowed anytime as long as they conform to the rules.
sure
ask away Lil_B
I wonder if Wrek would kick me for linking to his own art :)
I don't know :p
If I were a pony
I would look like this
http://i.imgur.com/stOho.png
I want to make a second youtube account and it says in the name "only letters, numbers and periods are allowed" , what are periods? Lack of basic knowledge here or maybe I'm just derping right now
Lil_B: periods as in "."
here comes Gods punnishment *shakes...*
ok, I thought so, but when I tested it it still dodn't except it, thats what confused me
Just a little something I made
_ and such is not allowed
back from shaving my neckbeard
dat progress
I have a ponytail in real life ^^
oh oh, Wrek!
Mabby you could make like a belt thingy to hold her metal leg?
(just a suggestion o:))
If anyone needs le I'll be watching... somthing
Got pretty quiet.

hi FillyFlam and CrimsonPhoenix
I can't find it
it's usually bottom right
from the video?
on the screen or bellow it?
next to small, large, fullscreen, watch later button
yeah
CrimsonPhoenix: The same button that controls video quality?
yeah
It might only work on certain videos. I just checked it on the one I'm listening to now and it doesn't give any other options

ji Gamer_Luna
'ello Gamer_luna
Gamer_luna: Holla! :)
hai Gamer_luna
:O Gamer_luna! It's been some time!
so why is Predator in League of Legends?
Invi: Well, it's made of rock so I can't exactly color it. Actually, the pics don't do it justice. The rock looks very pretty close up
Madsurge
Stuff happened....
Gamer_luna: bad stuff?
Midnight_Fyre, oh ok then ^^ you could do another one and experiment around with the details like hair and eyes
I got shot two times,lost my eye and voice in a crash AND need brain sugery...so yeah...
Gamer_luna: O__O
Invi: Yes, I'd like to do another. Maybe not for a while though because that took a long time and I'm pretty busy now that summer is over
you, you did?
Midnight_Fyre, you still have the weekends ^^
It's been horrible.my room mate Matt died yesterday also...
Gamer_luna, I am extremely sorry but I find your story hard to believe
true, but i work every other weekend and i have a feeling i'll need the others to catch up on classwork
CrimsonPhoenix: I'm alright with that,the internet is about trust.So you trust me or not :)
It's your choice,I know it unbelieveable,I bearly believe it/
But hey,stuff happens,right?
hello Gamer_luna <3
Gamer_luna: explain in great detail if it takes longer than 3 minutes your lieing
DoctoDoctorWho i dont think it works like that
DoctoDoctorWho, yeah me neither
CCCP: does now
It takes me 5 minutes to even write HI sometimes,my shoulder broke >:(
08,01my god guys, you could maybe just initially give him the benefit of the doubt...
I'm back

Gamer_luna im so sorry :(

Goddammit mips, why you so unstable these days

I can't wait to season 3. c:
Wrek?
We all can't.
MadSurge i think mips is always bad
I can.
Pegasister me either
I'm doing it right now :$
I really really want to see the commander applejack picture when it's done
but I can't seem to load it
:'(
Pegasister: Are you excited? We're all so excited! :D
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LkJ3_nVq8s
05Masdragonflare: hm?
Pegasister: are you new?
MadSurge: Nope.
*suddenly a stream!*
I can't see the streaming :c
Heya
Stream died O__o
Hey Pinkie_Brony!
Pinkie_Brony Howdy.
Why is it just a wheel of death?
*sudddenly, buffer every five sec*
Pegasister: Heller
08,01Pegasister: you just earned yourself a permaban
Hey MadSurge !!!
permaban?
Permaban, for what?
S3 spoiler YT link
08,01permanent ban for posting season 3 spoilers
What is that?
08,01rules are rules
Oh, I see... do what you think prudent
if some one is knew you shouldnt ban
new*
08,01and it says clearly in the topic
"S3 Spoilers are not permitted. Discussion of anything related to S3 will result in a ban. "
Hullo all
hi Unnr
Turn a blind eye
Hai CCCP
o/
he or she can appeal later, probably
DoctoDoctorWho thats mean
CCCP: On the one hand, sure, on the other hand, you should read the rules if you're new.
^
not new user though
tSparx yeah i know, but it really wasnt somthing harmful
Did Anyone even present the rules to Pegasister?
Oh wait, Pegasister did say she wasn't new.
you could of just seen the link and clicked out of it
I just got back here, what did Pegasister do?
does looking at the title of that video ruin season 3 for you?
Rex_Mundi: Link S3 material
She get kicked?
CCCP: She's a veteran here, and them's the rules. I again bow down to "what mods say goes"
rules are rules, appeal can be sent and she'll probably be back in a few days
Rex_Mundi, banned
08,01CCCP: the rule is no s3 spolleers. that was an s3 spoiler. she should know better
Rex_Mundi: Permabanned
Rules are rules though. There isn't really an excuse not to know them. :S
morning everypony
GilDash exactly
Allos Pearly
Pearly: Mornin' Pearly :)
How serious of a spoiler?
mornin' Pearly
killerpony7733: Long time no see! How're you doing? :)
Rex_Mundi: That admittedly doesn't matter.
and the blasphemer is silenced...
08,01CCCP: noits not
she got Appeal mail adress in the kick message, so it's not that harsh
GilDash pretty average been a tiny bit busy with school, but else i have been on lurking around and all
08,01some people dont want to know anything anout s3
08,01at all
killerpony7733: Ah, lurking. I've been busy that I've had to lurk, I'm afraid. :(
/me raises hand as one of those people
08,01including some mods
And the mods made it clear that THIS chan would involve no spoilers, at all, period
Same here. I abhor spoilers.
heh, still interested, was it like a plot summary, or was it something small?
CCCP: Drop it.
CCCP: What the mods say goes
as killerpony7733 lurks in the night because he´s... TROGDOR!~
Why should we have to? It's in the rules, clearly stated as bannable
/me raises hand with Vivix
all I saw for season 3 is what they presented with 2 songs, but that is is... I think season 3 will be a surprise for us all
okies :s
HAI :)
CCCP: You don't have to like it, but...
I didn't even see the two songs, or their titles
but they were shown at comic con
Pearly: as it should be
Pearly: There's no reason for her to post them here though.
GilDash well i haven't been purely lurking. Been either playing games or purely just checking back and forth on the stream talking with random ponies here and there
Ijust can't wait for it if it is a surprise
08,01CCCP: it was agreed by all the mods that s3 spoilers are a bannable offence, so its not going to change
I didn't want to know what the songs are about, what they sound like, who sings in them , or anything, so I avoided the EQD post, and I don't want to know anything about it even if they were on comiccon
Oh I didn't post them here, I just said last time someone stopped me. I was looking for online lyrics for the orher songs
killerpony7733: I know what you mean. I've been busy with things elsewhere, so I can relate to that. :)
08,01CCCP: well, you have the right to disagree,but rules is rules
I sense it will be a surprise on what is or what has not showin in s2
08,01and the rule abouts3 spoilers stands
CCCP: Then apply as mod next time there is an open casting call. The Rules are Da Rules
Mods have to apply rules they don't agree with, so that wouldn't really help
is the streaming back on?
BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD! SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE! BANNS FOR THE BAN HAMMER!
Unnr i could never be a mod lol
i they posted anything onit, they should just block those site, glad I have not seen anything about ir
did some dumbass post shit about season 3?
DoctoDoctorWho: That last one... is it bad I dread that most? XD
Mm, then I could type in purple... xD
Buytoast2 yep
ahahaha
Unnr i dont even know what client im using!
I could have the most obnoxious colours ever,
Pegasister did
GilDash: no, thats just common sense
CCCP
Magic?
DoctoDoctorWho: Good to know it's common sense to fear a ban then to worry about blood and skulls being taken from people. XD
I fear the Ban Hammer not; the Ban Hammer's here to protect me. As long as I stay with the mods, the mods will stay with me :$
Is the streaming back on? :)
lol
08,01tSparx: cometobed.png
tSparx: Problem is when you're not exactly best friends with the mods... :D
GilDash: I'm more than used to getting along with people I don't like :)
tSparx: Same here. Doesn't mean it always works in reverse though. :D
Yes, just because one disagrees or dislikes eachother, doesn't mean one has to pitch a fight
There should be a chat revolution somday
CCCP: I'd RP that xD
lol
Morning, guys
PillowPoni: Mornin' :D
guys?
Masdragonflare what?
well
ohhaibtw!
I was just wondering if anyone can see the streaming?
How you doing tSparx?
Hello GilDash! :D
Masdragonflare: There's still a stream, but man oh man can I not watch it xD
MadSurge: Holla! :)
Does everypony have the same problem?
Masdragonflare the exciting world of gray dots geting chased by white dots is on.
Masdragonflare: Too choppy on this end, buffer for 20 sec every 5 sec :/
So yes.
jow you doing MadSurge
PillowPoni: I'm great, how 'bout chu?
jow
alright tell me when it's back on
I'll refresh then
05dayum the prosthetic turned out good
alexxm: better than the last two days
It is by mods alone the hammer´s set in motion. It is by power of OP that users acquire kicks, kicks acquire bans, the bans a warning. It is by mods alone the hammer´s set in motion.
Wrek: Aw is this a KiwiBlitz!Pony :P
tSparx : I'm doing fine. Saw that there was a ban.
*hugs PillowPoni*
Ohai PillowPoni
05tSparx: what?
Wrek: All I can see wright now is a prosthetic limb, and I now want to see a pony based off the main char in KiwiBlitz (webcomic)
oh hey streem,long time no see
right* now
so wrek, is this 40k AppleCreed?
DoctoDoctorWho: Applejack would make a horrible Creed
PillowPoni: Yeah, sad times :/
Unnr: maybe, but dayum can she make it look good
05no warhamemr here
tSparx: sad times indeed. I remember my first actual ban.
Good morning, everypony! :)
PillowPoni: I've only been auto-kicked for spam once.
Ravebrony: Hey there :)
Mornin' Ravebrony :)

Good evening
/me waves to tSparx, thelonepony, and Applejack2012

DoctoDoctorWho: "I... am a ma-an of constant bannage..."
I love abortion edits
o_o
PillowPoni why were you banned?
PillowPoni: What'd you do, silly poni?
I was once banned for multiple accounts when me and my cousin lived in the same house using a reuter
on a forum
I've never been banned in here
MLG PRO
This is my first time on here.. I feel like a noob. XD
pegasister96, read the rules, about us, FAQ and staff
pegasister96: So, hm, wait, let's be clear, no relation to the pegasister who was on here eariler, ja?
links are above the stream
No, that wasn't me.
PillowPoni: Oh xD
Is there a stream?
Or did it go off?
PillowPoni, should've been permanant
buffer = :(
I just finished browsing the top links on the page. :3
cause you bet your life in a Russian Roulette
pegasister96: We'd all appreciate it if you familiarized yourself with teh rules, but maybe the most important that you couldn't guess: 1) nothing about Ssn 3 in here, 2) no non-image links during streams
pegasister96, you've gain some of my respect points
tSparx: We thought you was turned into a banne´d toad.
pegasister96: Yay, a n00b who reads the rules!
CrimsonPhoenix: lolol I lasted a good while. About 15 minutes.
Unnr: Who, me?
pegasister96 hi! :)
Sure thing! ^^
tSparx: >_>
how are you pegasister96?
I'md doing great, thanks! And you?
Unnr: Waht, you ping'd me, now I'm just confused :/
G'day pegasister96 :)
pretty good pegasister96 :)
Hello Ravebrony!!!
tSparx: Never mind....
How are you, pegasister96?
Hiya CCCP!!! :$
05*sigh* pegasister96: you posted a season 3 spoiler which on this chat leads to an isntant ban. Had you read our rules you would know this. I URGE you to read them and send an appeal to our email so that we will unban you. BUT! becasue you now ban evaded I am to put you on the PErmanent Ban list. however i am willing to look past that this once IF you go read the rules and send an appeal.
5got it?
pegasister96: so, howdja enjoy the ban hammer?
08,01Wrek: different person
CrimsonPhoenix: BETTER ART THAN TIM BUCKLEY'S :D

pegasister96: unfortunately pegasister might be one of those common nicknames :D
oh my gosh...
wait...What happened?
that was funny
brb
I miss all the good stuff that goes down in here :(
08,01Wrek: <3
I guess I should change my nickname. xS
pegasister96: Nah, don't worry bout it :P
pegasister96: anyway, welcome aboard!
I'm glad to be so cordially welcomed. :D
OH!... shoot, i had stream for about 3 seconds :D
and here I was told to give a benefit of doubt
morning
Darn you, Miiiipppsss!!!
pegasister96: If anyone else gives you a hard time for your username, we'll sort it out :)
Hey Derpy_Hooves!
Oh, thank you tSparx. :)
05here it is
pegasister96: if you feel like it, type /nick at the start of a sentence and then insert the new nick. Your nick is still fine :D
05large as fuck
Alrighty then. ^^
Wrek: Sehr awesome!
aren't the ears a bit big?
05you are a bit big
does the stream keep buffering for anyone else
ban him for being a darn dirty troll
I like Wrek's new earstyle
Actually I'm underweight
alexxm: I gave up trying to watch it xD
Yea, it buffers for me too. :\
Buytoast: You are ban-thirsty aren't ya xD
alexxm: Yeah, i get stream for about 3 seconds :D
Wrek: that looks awesome
pegasister96: so tell us, who's your favorite pony? :D
Wrek: nice Applejack. Permission to add to my favorites?
I'd say Fluttershy ^^
lawl
You need permission to add to favorite?
well, at least this time i wasn't banned for asking who rinachan is
08,01who is rinachan?
I dunno.
Some girl
please guys
pegasister96: excellent choice :D
Everytime I see that "Mode #bronystate +b" go up
My heartrate doubles :$
He's out of control! :O
Buytoast: how'd you get banned for asking who rinachan is?
08,01you whore <3
Aha, thank you MadSurge!
05you lvoe it
tSparx I could imagine you waking up in the middle of the night screaming becuase you ahd a dream about bronystate chat syaing your banned.
pegasister96: Certainly a pony or two 'round these parts that share that opinion
05but yeah guise!
05its done
05commetn and fave :3
/me shudders at what Barbetos suggested
05probably not 56k friendly
damn internet
I dont think ive ever commented on Wreks work O.o
people still use 56k?
^
Oh I like that shading a lot more
CrimsonPhoenix in texas, yes
woooow
morning bronystate :3
Woo, Texas! xD
56K is still around
The company I work for still signs up people for dial up
I wish Fluttershy was real...
so is the lack of in ternet
internet*
We generally try to avoid it
hello everygrasshopper
I can get lack of internet
ohai :)
/me takes a deep breath of air
I'm going to cosplay as a human fluttershy xD
I know people that can't afford it
Evening, everybrony.
pegasister96: you texan? :D
Hey Malavolent
good evening
Sure am!
Hello MaxTheBrony mitamaking nameless pony #7007 and Malavolent
Heya tSparx :)
but I'm surprised there are ISP that still offers 56k
pegasister96: then do you love or hate Applejack? :D
CrimsonPhoenix: It's surprisingly widespread
Oh God, I'd say it's more of a love-hate kind of thing. xD
05CrimsonPhoenix: makes sense to me, you get lots of money for a shitty service
hai wrek :3
how you doing Malavolent
Ope
Wrek not if the competitor offers a beter deal
alexxm: It's K. School starts tommorow, but it's K. What about you?
i'm good Malavolent
School should start on Tuesday
ITS REALLY fun to PM yourself
pegasister96: least favorite pony?
MadSurge who is your favorite pony?
pegasister96: You of course shouldn't feel required to answer these if you're worried someone'll troll you for disliking their favorite pony
mitamaking: Also no
To bad the internet did not come out around the time phones did. We would have awesome interent everywhere by now.
mitamaking: A lot of places do the Fall to Spring system we do
CCCP: Pinkie of course :D
That is a surprise
pegasister96: But I won't troll you for disliking my favorite pony :)
MadSurge wrong! the anwswer is every pony is equal
Ah, I'm afraid I'd be spammed with hate. But I don't really care for Rarity. :X
CCCP: No, the answer is [pony(ie)]
(ies*)
D: Rarity is best pony
MadSurge: Pinkie more like Stinkie, am I right? :$
CCCP: she's my favorite, not the best. Everyone is best pony!:D
so is AJ
Rarity, pinkie and Fluttershy are my favourites
mitamaking: more like Spittie Pie :D
though I love the rest, even if RD grates me sometimes
/me surreptitiously high-fives pegasister96
xD
Though I love Rarity too <3
I find it so sad how well Fluttercry fits Fluttershy
mitamaking: But then she wrestles a BEAR
I love Rarity, and Applejack of course
tSparx: Then she is scared of a butterfly
pegasister96: as you can see no mane six is really hated here :D so feel free to talk about your preferences!
Oh. ^^
mitamaking: Then she out-stares a cockatrice
Well I don't like :D that much
Flutter is bipolar
Is it weird that my 9 year old cousin thinks that My Little Pony : Friendship Is Magic is for babies, like i was watching it and she said it was for babies and stupid
Trassalderen
kids that age haate everything even slightly childish it seems
mitamaking Fluttershy is best pony
Ohai again , what are you talking about?
CCCP: Some kids fight kid-stuff because they wanna grow up. I was that kid :/
CCCP: but also worst pony
CCCP: nope, he's just a silly kid that knows no better because he still thinks girls suck :D
apparently me and my sister hated childrens tv at that age
05there we go
MadSurge actually i forgot to say its a she
05tail added
Look at Disney, most people love it from birth to about 10 then again aroun 20 to death
MadSurge: she*
05cant believe i forgot that one
05again xD
mitamaking lies!
tSparx i guess
Wrek: Oh, haha, i was just about to ask :D
Fluttershy is a pony.
CCCP: I present Toy Story 3 as proff
CCCP: :D maybe she likes Arnold style action :D
*proof
mitamaking wat
05problem is the file is 13 Mb
05take ages to upload to DA
maybe..
She reallyy like Anime
Look at how many 20 year olds or so loved Toy Story 3, and look what they said about animation before then, note I am talking on majority not indivdual people
likes*(
Liking anime doens't mean you don't like ponies, I would know
mitamaking oh i thought you were taliknng about Fluttershy still
dat tail <3
pretty much all my friends know i like ponies now...
mitamaking: I like cartoons regardless of provenience
I prefer western animation
Me too MadSurge but I was in the minority
CCCP: and what di they think of it>
I don't have anything against anime, but usually the story and animation don't captivate me
I luff Anime and Western Cartoons
i like both to be honest
05who wanted a wallpaper version?
y'know what else I love?
Food.
I prefer Western Cartoonsa
I mean look at the return of Toonami or The 90s were All That, all trying to play up on nostalgia
Vivix: then you've been watching the wrong ones
I'm off to get food, later y'all!
Dark_Horst, maybe, I've only seen what was offered to me by anime nerds
Wrek: i think we'd all like one
I prefer Japanese cartoons, with a few exceptions(Ponies, Avatar, Word Girl)
MadSurge well they dont really care much, like a few of my friens really hate bronies and a few like the show a bit.. but thats all.
not everyone will like it, no matter how well made it is
Inb4 90s nostalgia storm
Vivix: i think we found the reason
Hehe
But look, even if it's rated 99/100 by people, someone will hate it

Applejack2012: The amount of people who love the 90's but were born in like 1998 is TOO DAMN HIGH

/me actually goes away now
tSparx|Lunch lol
i find it hard to find anime i like myself, but once in a while something pops up
ghost in the shell for example, which has been streamed here
love that one
I've seen it, but didn't quite like it, saw it here aswell
I watch more Western cartoons than anime
of course I'm sure theres some anime out there that I might love, but I don't prefer it
i was born in 1996 and i dont remember the 90's i dont ever remeber any thing before 2005
except breaking my tooth
I was born in 1989, I remember the 90s, but not 90s TV
or well I remember Micheal Jackson being on TV, but I was too young during most of it
