*shifty eyes* ...yes
of course you are
Survivors are left to become horribly mad
reapers kill you, rape you and eat you, and not in that order
I've always wondered why "technically living zombies" like the ones from 28 days later and other material never turn on each other. If they are so uncontrollanbly violent and agressive, why do they alwasy seem to be able to work together in some sort of strange pack instinct?
Fenr: 0.1% of 30,000,000 is 30,000

AND everyone lived happily ever after!
So they did manage to kill the Reaver fleet if they got through
fus ro stab?
Most of the character development, and the basic plot synopsis are in the series. But understanding the plotline of the film doesn't require it.
everyone that lived
looks inda like the girl from FEAR lol
KwakLad: I meant the girl that just owned the reapers. I said a line she should've said. I never saw this movie before.
lul
13now that's a headstone
actually all three of the main male characters were in ODST(and previous Halo games)
Dem futurey tombstones.
REAVERS, GUYS
Exactly
rexivan except for all those people who died
I wanna holograpic tombstone when i die.
ha!
I know it wasn't relevant to the movie, but I stil kind of wish they would have had a bonus showing the Alliance vs. Reaver battle
excepte wash, shepard, and mr. universe
Awesome gravestones.
Holographic headstones, NICE!
You know, except, Mr Universe, Shepard Book and Wash
Those headstones look more...gaudy than memorable.
00,03Ah!
so were those people who died main characters in the series?
0,14Mal was Buck, Jayne was Butch, and Wash was Mickey
I want my body launched into space :V
I think

No idea. Never watched the series.
September, yeah I know I'm sorry, I'm only on text so i didn't realise you were at that part, I'm sorry for calling you out
the pilot certainly is though
quick, Knights of Cydonia video! =)
KwakLad Its k dawg.
Aye.
somehow the only death i feels sorry for is the pilot's
I think Mr Universe was the equivalent of a questgiver
lol repair da ship
Sheepard too
he treminded me of joker
My entire thing got to a standstill
dat ending
don't give any plot as to what happened after????
SEXY
Am I the only one who seese the moral questions this movie raises?
DAT SEXEH TIEM
Go kill ten space boars.
looked like a Flak-88
bow chika bow wow
00,03Buck gets ALL the ladies!
peek a boo!
0,14Ceiling River is watching you. :3
oh snap sexy time
Tap Dat ass
IngloriousPony89: not at all.
at least she moves on fast
Happy ending
and sex
lol
wait, how'd they get the money to repair the ship?
That's not Buck
Celiling River watches you
/me distributes moar Rallys/Checkers fries
oh god
magiv
LOL
magic
who was in the vent?
Buck had the big machineguns
HAHAH
Origin of celing cat
07,01your welcome, I hope our techies are able to identify the problem
ceiling derpy is watching...always watching
River!
00,03So, Mickey?
dat ceiling River Tam
lol so what happenedddddd
Wow he's STILL alive? Kill him.
whats on after this?
*Deep Voice* FINISH HIM.
13fillion reminds me of... brad pitt crossed with....
Ponies
0,14nope, Buck was Mal
13i've been trying all movie to think who else he reminds me of
is the Black Guy a main character in the series?
Arrest him. Arrest him! Please arrest him? Simon says arrest him.
Shizuka: me
Defeat means friendship, September
brad pit crossed with ponies?
don't go there
no he is onlly in the moive
/me 07,01tried to understand the movie but failed ;_;
so... who is worst pony?
CriticKitten Defeat means revenge.
What if the Alliance continued there testing on creating a "gas" that made it so everyone is calm? Would it be worth it? And is worth having very little crime and chaos if it means that people will be partially mindless zombies?
Btw, Last Roundup is back on iTunes
Same here, Luna
"Do you want cake or death?" "Cake!"
Luna, how?
Discord is best pony.
/me helps luna understand the movie, in song! :Y
Yes, but Redemption means Death.
This is harder to understand than Inception...
there is no worst pony
0,14the ODSTs' roles in Halo: ODST mirror their roles in Firefly
^ Luna
they had to kill wash
i understands it
I haven't seen Firefly and mostly understand the movie
Remove free will to begin downfall of society.
Pinky noooooooooooooooooooooooo
god damn why the hell is it lagging and yet I can load 1080p videos without it having to buffer?
INCEPTION WASN'T AHRD TO UNDERSTAND
not mindless zombies, just... controlable.
IT WAS FUCKIGN SIMPLE
Eh, I got most of it. But for some reason my computer sucks at streaming. Probably Flash.
sorry there is no more cake
Yes they do... That's one reason why Halo is awesome
what is this firefly everyone keeps talking about???
Inception isn't that hard, once you understand the levels
Inara <3
Makes ya think dont it?
IngloriousPony89: eenope. It's not. That's pretty much what this film says. By trying to make society "better" they doomed it.
BALDWIN
0,14Buck/Mal is the leader, Dutch/Jayne are the heavy weapons guys, and Mickey/Wash are goof with vehicles
/me makes more cake magically appear
This movie, I mean.
inceptions is NOT AHRD AT ALL
You need a 8 in INT to understand Inception
I haven't even watched Inception.
firefly is the series the movie is based on
I don't get the movie reviewers who said Inception was hard to understand
Buck isn't mal
the hoice is or death
Makes me think about shooting zombies. Philosophy can buck off.
07,01so the question is speed creds or normal creds?
inception was just kinda dumb
NOrmal
00,10othere then backstorys of charicters Firefly adds little to the movie.
choice*
Luna: normal
speed
just wondering when the sequel is, Incipio means beginning
Buck and Jayne share Adam Baldwin
normal creds
buck is mal
Normal for the music
Luna: the music is wonderful
2x creds
nad why does MY KEYBOARDING SUCK SO MUCH?
wHAT IS FIREFLY
I didnt understand Inception. Then again I wasnt really paying attention
07,01okidokie
"we have found this land and we shall call it... This land."
08,01Luna: i also vote normal creds
Is Summer Glau a main character in the series?
Space: Inception is pertaining to the important element of the plot
Firefly is a great series
08,01because msuic
yes she is
Dark_Horst, Imma vote Carbon based error
07,01@ grayhoof watch it another time ;)
speed creds
Sure they might think it's deranged But they won't give it a thought After they have no free will
Who's Summer Glau?
the cake is a lie
everybody on the ship is a main character
dat fail at lyrics
lol
Meanwhile: actress who plays River
why do I get the feeling something is about to go wrong?
Creds?
0,14Buck IS MAl
Meanwhile the hot chick
/me has still got to see inception
i saw it
Back in time for movie night... sorta :p
Buck's VA is Jayne
0,14nope
Ponibas: could also be the blended scotch whiskey
1st rule of flying is Do a Barrel Roll!
they even modeled the characters faces of the actual people
River isn't that attractive
We don't accept creds here I need something more real
0,14Buck's VA is Nathan Fillion
Is better
The crazy psychic?
sorry guys, was playing some Dark Souls and getting my ass kicked
MUCH BETTER
PRESS Z OR R TWICE
Saxy: I checked IMDB
is it at least Glenfiddich?
You should see her in a different roll. she is well nice.
Yup Meanwhile
Meanwhile: yes
Bucks VA is Nolan North
but shes adorkable
theres an easter egg with the cake in an empty room
Ah.
otakon oh you.
oh cool, last roundup is back on itunes
so did everyone revolt and overthrow the government or what happened next!!!!?????
nope
Love, not engines, make ships fly
0,14IMDB lies, check Fillion's wiki
sadly no. soemthing named Teacher's
Love kepsher in the air? I could have sworn that was duct tape.
never heard of it
...
unless they derped or a troll flash-updated it, then it says that it is Buck
Love conqures all, Nature protects the innocent
13inception's pretty easy to follow once the rules of dreaming click for you
die End
not attractive? Did you not see her murdering all those Reavers? if that isn't hot I don't know what is.
Snakeeeeees: Nothing, they go back to their life of crime
Dken2021 haz it been modified?
My Little Serenity: Engines are Love
and then they explode
OMG he did a barrel roll.
the end
Indeed :P
/me 13giggles <3
the end
yaaaaay
0,14Buck cameos in Halo: Reach, and it's Nathan Fillion's voice
... i so did not read Click

*claps* 8.47/10
that was....one of the best films ive seen in a while....even without understanding the context due to not watching the series
9000/Power Level
coolstorybro/10
I give it a 7.5 for a FIRST TIME WATCHER if you NEVER saw the series
as a fan of firefly this did ruin it a bit for killing off some off wash
didn't get to see it all
I rate this movie Muffins / Muffins :P
They are giving it well high ratings in the mane chat

PONIES MAKE EVERYTHING BETTER
GOnna make noms for Ponies
08,01because i LOVED firefly
Pretty good actually. Were it easier for non-Firefly people to access I'd say excellent, as is....7 or 8 outta 10 probably.
yeah, its not canon to the series
Gumri: they give everything high ratings in the chat.
But 10/10 also bc Firefly is awesome
PONIES
08,01and then it was ZOMG SERENITY
Time for Season Shit.
I imagine that if I had watched Firefly I'd know the characters better and have more context and all that. But it was still neat.
Snakeeeeees: thats part of what makes it good
ponies ponies ponies ponies ponies ponies
Because her badassness doesn't make up for her lack of attractivness. Thus, she is not hot in my opinion
13interesting choice of font for credits..
put ur ranking in terms of an arithmetic series
WHY DO PEOPLES LOVES THIS
08,01and i though they were gonna bollocks it up
Better than Wingdings =p
wait is it movie night atm?
08,01BUT THEY DID THE OPPOSITE! \o/
it had the potential to go 4 seasons
0,14I dunno, I've never seen Firefly before, and I nuunderstood it
I personally think this movie was space monkeys with a side of muffins and Clopfiction with a side of Spam and cake on that. It was ok. I guess.
00,03^^^
otakon: i give it a 8/10 for being very good movie and being relatively hard Sci-Fi
It always makes me moist when you say my name, [GOLD]GabeMoist ~~
or are we just running through random crap?
at the least
jffry890: yep
13never saw firefly either
I give it a 7, only because I had no clue who those people were
IngloriousPony89: no, I'm saying how was that whole scene not absolutely hot?
This reminds me, I need to finish my Confederacy game on Victoria 2.
0,14*understood
the movie cant hold a candle to the series though
Luna: there an innermishun?
Watching firefly helps to make lotsa sense to this movie
im with Dermathil ~
0,14true
I haven't seen you get kicked lately, Bjornfot
I think I'm gonna go out for cupcakes.
13but this story seemed pretty straightforward
<-- wants to see a remake of Serenity starring the guys from MST3K.
07,01yush after the ponies
Stinkomanfan: space smugglers
I give it a "I didnt see any of it and its lagging incredibly massive"/10
0,14yeah, the movie works well as a standalone
I'm losing contact with the movie
Ummm......Bjornfot,don't try to get banned!
im gonna go to bed now, got to be up in the morning for my first brony meet, good night all
what happened?
DeadpoolDash Agree 100%
http://backsidepotential.com/wp-content/uploads/summer-glau-gq-01.jpg I'm sorry did someone ay she isn't hot?
Saxy: I did too, but it still contained a great deal of things that were probably from the show and you sorta needed the show to fill it out entirely
RAWRity: Oh that scene. Yeah that was pretty hot ill admit
two by two hands of blue
13i don't think they've rifftraxed serenity

RAWRity Ugh, yeah no kidding on that one.
ugh, I forgot how rich Ice Cream is. It's like pure fat and Sugar.
I have always felt the single gretest scene in this flick was the very ending--- long, dramatic, and slightly cheesy speach... and then, "Whta was that?"

Spike out did the element of generousity
she bounced like pinkie pie does.

She didn't mean to be manipulative. She's just that charming.
IT'S SUPER EFFECTIVE
Rarity makes me hot :$
Besides, he did get something good for it

It's super effective.

I like flowers
Paladin_Drakkenwolf: I can hear it now.
I think its quite amazing that spike has a female VA, with all those real masculine like laughs of his

Greed is now canon
His special talent is CHOLESTOROL!

Cheerilee - She's only unintentionally started events that nearly destroyed the town once... and nearly took down the kingdom by releasing Discord once.
Transparent eyelids
She gave it to him.
00,10getit cause spike is also the mayor
Lickety split is kinda cool, because some think he's a filly because he has eyelashes, and some thinks hes a foal because he's a bit small, but eh, he has a cutie mark so at least he's hit puberty~
pimpin time!
who doesn't like ice cream?
I WILL NEVER LOSE MY PRECIOUS

He's gonna be dead pony soon from diabeties though
this is probably one of my least favorite eps, when i see things like this it just gives me pangs of frustration
Why Cheerilee and not Lickety Split? And Cheerilee gave him that without him asking. I will never get that one scene.

3A dear mine is nearing homelessness and desperately needs our support. You should know her as Octavia; the former mod of BronyState, and the same girl that first came up with the name Octavia for the pony. So I have formed a group made up of some friends to stream a weekend long event to raise money for her which will hopefully help her get a place to stay; from now until 7:00pm CST Sun.
3This might be her last chance left with these tough times. I ask that you please watch our stream, have fun, and donate at www.bronyfunds.com on behalf of our dear friend Octavia.

BTW, who were the lottery winners?

might as well play part 2
So... we're in great danger, because Calgon is still alive.... Um... without any support, everyone will shoot him on sight, and he's probably crippled now. Suddenly that seems... almost as pointless as the rest of the movie.
I think we might have got some of the mods stuck with journey in their head

MEALS DON'T WORK THAT WAY
13spike is so uncouth
DEEsert
and then spike hurled
A lot of people complained that Pinkie didn't take the situation seriosly enough, even for her, but really she reacted the same way when NMM appeared
Celestia-sama!
Get on the train!
The castle needs more railings
otakon: I doubt that-- she'd have used that in Lesson Zero if that was the case.
Shizuka: what was that failsafe spell supposed to do...and why hasnt she used it since
Midnight_Fyre: eeyup
he can't help it
Or teleport.
Ah this episode
if burping scrolls was like throwing up he desserves WAY more respect
Aww, I feel so bad for Spike in part two when he can't stop getting letters.
13many more railings
pffff Celestia.
censor ponies: ***you twilight **** you all
Oh, there's a railing
Celestia sent a letter, shit is serious
one of these days Spike would #2 a scroll
The start of this episode is rather fast paced..
IngloriousPony89: well, I'd hope Pinkie wouldn't be as enamored with white milk.
No, Celestia is gonna rape you all
I hope space horses don't need to be milked because that would be a dealbreaker
princess celestia, we came as fast as we could.. because we knew you wouldnt do shit
There's not enough railing on those stairs
09,01Unlimited Rail Works.
so what movies got picked for next week?
11,01Canterlot has an unstable foundation.
Molestia!

Shizuka, they also need more signs
Pinkies a wizard, nothings move powerful than her
Do not want to see lunarletic

Next season: Celestia VS. Kefka - Battle to the Death!

wait...why does discord get a stained glass? come on now trollestia
Discord, I'm howling at the moon/And sleeping in the middle of a summer afternoon
good morning everypony
and each origiunally represented an element
She didn't explain that point.
00,03HEY! I;m the king of Puns here!
I love the background music in this whole segment
StormChaser: bc Luna was coming back one day
...She gets... her servents to do that for her :s
morning derpy
the helaments of armory?
Celestia needs to shut up and let more interesting ponies their job.
/me has fallen head over railing for Luna
So, who here is wondering if they've been dropping hints about the season finale through season two?
Stormchaser: Seems to be magical auto history.
magic stained glass
discord?
13celestia is amused by that..
EARTH
The "no longer connected" part and what Discord is about to say to Celestia I believe will be the focal point of the S2 finale. Calling it now.
The power is YOURS!
the elements of harm
DocSane how so?
hey twilight, hey hey twiglight
:Y
Jigglysaint: enope, only Luna and Celestia at that point, they each represented three elements apices
Worth the promotion out of that job

princess celestia is very knowledgable and inspirational yet very clueless at the same time
11,01A box!
They see me trollin, they hatin.
le gasp!
Twilight is the captain planet of equestria
Celestia, you done goofed!
fluttershy broke the fourth wall

I also wonder if Starswirl the Bearded was mentioned twice for a reason
......I have my eye on you Pinkie
okay have fun pinkie

They should've protected that box with some railing and moats
oh pinkie, how you troll more than trollestia

Why are we having this conversation?

Hello Q
/me FAN FILLY SQUEEL
Q-gasm
i missed u too
and by "dominant" he means "You'll need to scream the safeword at the top of your lungs"
I missed Q
Oh hai Q
Discord is so swag.
no he turns them into glass!
will discord ever appeared on another episode?
discord is just Q when he decides to mix it up by messing with the heads of ponies instead of Picard for a change.
I was surprised last season when I realized they'd done a story arc with the Gala
hoof stomp
Tovler wants to make love to Princess Luna
hoof bump
So she's very raepie?
why didn't Celestia do shit?
discord is best villain
00,10wananannananan
oh shit celeste hoof stamped
what fun is there in making sense? --- discord bein epic
And I'm trying to talk him out of it
that's pretty strong glass
those are some hard ass windows
Celestia can't do anything.
I can't sit idly, no, I can't move at all~ I curse the name, the one behind it all...~ Discord~
He wants to make sweet, sweet love down by the fireplace.
must be bulletproof
Those are pretty awesome windows
magic windows
o-o
lol nopony insults the princess - thank god were not ponies
She's not strong enough to challenge Discord without the EoH
No access to the Elements anymore, remember?
I really think some of this dialog is foreshadowing.
Personally, Ican't equate Discord with Q. Q always has a reason for what he does-- even if we can't figure the bucking thing out-- where Discord just want to spread pointless chaos at random.
lol ^
Well our relationship would be legal here in North Carolina. (u mad, gays)
13Q read the episode synopsis from last season
dat flutter face
Wait, Rarity is generous? When did that happen?

What's a more violent term for Rape?

oh pinkie pie youre so racist

ery day
awww pinkie
discord is so much like q
Everyday I'm shufflin'

Moonwalker
Celestia is such a stick in the mud.
Discord is just a red herring
every time i have to say something someone beats me to it
Tovler: actually, I think NC has some pretty strict beastiality laws.
q is a brony!
Because that describes her
best part
Everyday I'm discordin'
Pinkie Pie is the true god of chaos
Q: U MAD?

Humpslam?
Well its a good thing we have a labarynth, or this plot would have never happened
She's busy playing X-Box
I still say Pinkie is directly related to a pony that was REALLY messed up by Discord's magic many years ago
Welp im done for this episode
pomf?
See, Discord failed because he didn't use any railings.
wing fail
Nope.avi
GOOD GOD WHY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THIS!?
thats what she said
Midnight_Fyre that's true, but how often does she give anyone anything without an ulterior motive?

Big_Jakeintosh: Space Mutiny, the MST3K version
Not at all
trippy
apple creeps
I like how Discord emulates thier cutie marks to corrupt them
there no way you can eat all those fucking apples
unfortunately, i don't know how to write the word "Minotaur" in red with a striked line through it on this chat...
pinkies excuse for flying
I still think Plan 9 beats it, otakon.
Speaking of bad innuendo… heh heh heh.
anybody remember creeps from Final Fantasy 1?
she ate too many apples
Thick McRunfast
ooh! ooh! Got a good one! Crotch slam!
To be fair, I've rarely tried to talk people out of it. But as your freind I think that maybe I can hook you up with one of the Wonderbolts

he would never do that, it would destroy the rainbow factory
yfw SlurryMoon can read the chat log

There's a clip on YouTube

They totally weren't tlaking about some... explicit things
USE FLUTTERSHYS FUS RO DAH!

so who won the lottery?
6_6 we will miss you
otakon: what?
Waffles: they aren't really anything
Actually, I kinda like her tomboyish voice better. :O
Luna, Marry me!!
Luna: is Danny Phanton too soon to be nastalgia?
.-.
I haven't seen this in years!
00,10I wont belive they changed the ep till I see the whole thing.
IngloriousPony89 call me Shirly, but mebe Apple itself modified it and got permission from Hasbro.
and what's this about derpy?
They changed derpy because a soccer mom got pissed.
what that voice ....
April 1st came early
night everypony
Dashie_Dashie: what???
mw too
00,10be it on hub or be it on itunes
fuck soccer moms
emangamer: they edited Derpy in "The Last Roundup", her eyes are normal, her voice is different and RD doesn't call her ANY name.
So, experiencing mixed feelings right now on the edited Derpy.
:'(
eisenhower?
:'(:'(:'(:'(:'(:'(:'(:'(
no
So while Hasbro itself won't change Ep14, Apple can.
RUN
is bad bad i say!!!
THIS ISN'T FAIR
RUUUUUUUN
otakon: umm...
what's derpy's name now?
War
Ehh, I like edited Derpy better.
ugggh
00,10oh hey that's right i have hub indemand.
but it's NOT DERPY
They... they didn't...
I think that we need to email 'The Hub' to start syndicating this.
WWI
animation+manias=animaniacs
everyone gets offended
my god...that voice, its so sexy
me too dashie
....I do not want to live on this planet anymore
maniacs*
the first one was Derpy
awwwww yeah dem pigeons
.-.
Orginal derpy was way better
Not sure if its apple or hasbro
Everybody hates their own country you know
/me is not buying the dvd/bluray if its that version
why do people think that derpy is offensive?
hope its not hasbro
this one is like some sad imitation
wat, dat history
I already hate apple
did he just say bitch
oh gosh what really Big_Jakeintosh
yeah
hi
badda bing!
yes
otakon: I thought they werent doing anything to derpy
my helmet
well......at least we have the unedited version
i've got ep 14 localy so origional derpy is preserved
EQD post
yup
for now
well maybe not apple as whole but the itunes store
no more derpy
listen you fat fuck-- o wait
you fat ffffffowl
fucking hasbro
Uh, perhaps I'm the only one, but I never thought they should've named her Derpy in the show at any point anyways. She was already named Ditzy. >_>
I demand an answer!
cool whip somethings up
.-.
00,10Coo it
meh map
is the last roundup still uneditied in the dvd coming out?
The Derpy nickname should have *stayed* a fan nickname.
why you no listen to fanbase when telling you not to change, and listen to a retard who is offended
that's all I'm gonna say.
honestly
I got my HD version of it already but I want to buy the DVD to show support
can anypony explain the derpy thing to me?
anyhoo. I'm out. Gonna work on more of my D&D campaign and then get some sleep.
its a pretty bad edit
probably not even gonna open it
otakon: are you SERIOUSLY blaming me for this
aw man, and I feeling sleepy too. stupid rage.
so much awkward silence in it
night guys
its more offensive that the offended people think that mental handicaps can't speak for themselves
because if so I'm about to get mad
Her voice is missing the adorable drawl, now.
emangamer: no, but I'd figure YOU'D be happy now
otakon: are you beign serious right now
emangamer: now there IS no pandering
bc it's not Derpy
ok i'm gonna say this. i love derpy and i'm a mental person. yeah
and it never will be again
I dont know if the dvd is gonns be changed I think I remember hearing it isnt hopefully not that would suck
night everypony.
Original Derpy. Never Forget.
ngiht Pale_Horse sleep well
07,01nighty
f
night pale_horse
nite
oh crap
night
nevar forget!
is original derpy still good on the dvd coming out at the end of the month?
damn this is actually really disheartening
StormChaser: I doubt it
Big_Jakeintosh, the people behind the Friendship Express said they weren't chaning it.
otakon: if you are really being serious, then you dont understand what I was complaining about and you being so accuitory is starting to make me mad
Hey guys, how's the picture coming?
http://i.imgur.com/Zsu0m.jpg
haven't seen this in ages
Well guys I gotta take a shower. It was really fun. Ciao!
Well, I doubt they'd have been able to change the episode on the DVD, seeing as they've already MADE them.
Everlasting_Joy: ok thats good
a gyro
woah love the drawing
that progress
Alright night everypony
Night everypony
good drawing
Night LunaTheBeloved.
maybe I should order it now just in case, I dont geel like they would change it that fast
emangamer: I'm not blaming you but I'd figure you'd be HAPPY that the scene is basically made moot
night LunaTheBeloved
Night Luna
LunaTheBeloved: g'night
00,03I'm the hero that Gotham needs...
LunaTheBeloved: night sleep well
voice change is acceptable imo, shame they removed the name though :'(
night LunaTheBeloved
Have fun with the post-show
CuddlyKittens11 its fantastic
....
otakon: you REALLY thought that...
rainbowdashing: htanks.
lol dictionary
Haeleus: they also fixed her eyes
wtf
/me watched the new version.
07,01night LTB
Night LunaTheBeloved
You can't have this bomb. It's mine.
/me sees nothing wrong with the new voice honestly
seriously?
they would have had to have done a recall of all of them, and reprint them. Lotta money and time, which means they'd have to delay release to accomplish it.
that pigeon gets pissed off
oh damn didn't notice that!
it is fitting that this gets rescinded... the whole derpy thing seemed to make peoplle think that we actually have some form of creative control over the show
stinkin hole!
emangamer: you didn't like the original scene, they CHANGED it so now it's NO type of fanservice whatsoever
which we dont
It's not the best VA but it's not all that awful.
no it's NOT THAT'
yes it's awful
00,10Gonna check indemand and see if that version is changed too.
now the voice doesnt match the video
at least that hamburger pizza slice I had was orgasmic.
00,03Something about that voice seemed... bad
CriticKitten - it's a more appropriate VA for the kind of character we all imagind Derpy to be
they went back and CHANGED IT that's the point
And the reference to her as Derpy should never have existed period. >_> It was a fan nickname and that is how it should've stayed.
I liked her original voice. I found it really adorable
holy crap this is pretty grim for a cartoon :P
This isn't as extreme, though, as Rose/Roseluck from last ep.
Scoot-Scootaloo: both voices, its a cheep hack
K_A - "Rose" short for "Roseluck?"
it's like if they went back and removed Porkie Pig's stutter
The fact that Derpy has crossed eyes is fanservse.
At the least, they edited the scene to fit the new lines, but still...
K_A - same "Dash," "AJ," "Pinkie," "Twi," etc etc etc
heh didn't imagine something like this could possibly "offend" any group. Guess it did somehow...
MirrorImage: Rose is her canon name as far as we know; Roseluck is her fan name.
Nothing will replace our reactions on that fateful day.
i feel kind of dissapointed thaat they removed derpy's name, it's like our pleas to leave her the way she is was kinda ignored
I love the entire main pony cast
otakon: you are accusing me of things that are unfair to me and its starting to get annoying...do you want me to go into pun mode?
or they rescinded all teh cartoons where Bugs Bunny dressed up like a girl
otakon: cuz I'll do it
hmm...whats going on right now ???
Thank god I wasn't banned
well I'm gonna buy the dvd but not open it just gonna sit on shelf I got all the episodes on my laptop pc and Ipod so yeah
Like DJ PON-3 vs. Vinyl Scratch (although both were fan-given).
Waffles - rage over them changing the Derpy scene
Ponies are flipping out over nothing.
oh
otakon: isn't that the majority of bugs bunny's stuff?
actually, they chengd the end of the Daffy Duck "Scarlet Pumpernickle" episode
Ohey Animaniacs
00,10Has any one actaly downloaded the new version of the ep and seen it yet?
^
Sumica - Seth put a youtube of the clip in question
It's on EQD
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/02/derpy-has-been-modified.html#more
i think derpy will continue to be derpy in ours and most of the creators minds though (they just had to remove the name because a select few flipped their shit) tl;dr nothing has changed
i didnt
eqs has'
your beaking the 4th wall
Sumica - it's first post EQD right now
00,10and seth always puts up 100% truthfull and fact checked news?
thats a shame
1,3heh
<_<
Sumica - he has a youtube of the scene in question
I'm going ot have a field day with this Derpy stuff. . . and here I thought I was done with it.
If the original episode had aired exactly like this new version, not ONE of you would be pissy right now. You'd still be thrilled she took an actual speaking role in an ep and this nonsense about "they changed it so it sucks now" wouldn't even be
I was fine with her staying as an Easter Egg, or remaining a silent character. But I feel bad now that they changed it.
Lunarletic: that's the point
I really apreciated the goodfeathers as a kid but now they are awesome
ooh god, they really wrecked it :(
CriticKitten: yh, but it DIDN'T
scene wasnt modified at all, and theres no post preduction on the new voice
why god whyyyyyyy
sigh
00,10like I said.
Everlasting_Joy: Good point.
HER NEW VOICE
i meant Never really lol derpy
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
CriticKitten: it's like changing history books or something
So forgive me if I'm not at all sympathetic to the whining of people who have overdramatized this into a Han Shot First moment. WHEN IT ISN'T.
00,10has any one seen it for them selves or just a clip?
general admission?
oh god i cant type tonight
wait who new voice huh?
13just the clip so far
At least we'll have a new episode tomorrow to makes us forget about this news… oh...
CriticKitten: I agree, but I don't like changing original material like this after the fact.
otakon, they do that akll the tine
haha war haha
all the time*
Tovler: no new episode 2morrow
yea i agree... its feeling a bit like communist china in here all the sudden
next week
Sumica: I saw the clip. I liked her original voice better. It was really adorable.
well, han solo didnt shoot first , regardless it changes the fan service of the episode because of political correctness gone too far
dat censorship
I feel like they are pandering to a vocal minority.
K_A: Neither do I but it's not our call. And honestly, it's not a bad change.
Ponibas: they don't do it to Disney cartoons, or old Looney Tunes cartoonns. damn stupid PC crap
man that voice i just can't.. damn i think it just dont fit her
they are pandering to a vocal minority
The voice change is somethign else, naturally.
To be perfectly fair, the original version probably never should have aired.
i said earlier, i know for a fact they chanced a Looney Tunes Episode
Cream colored ponies and crisp apple strudels
Doorbells and sleighbells
And schnitzel with noodles
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
These are a few of my favorite things
Also they cut some of RD's lines
I heard the voice and that is not derpy
holy shit
This whole Derpy thing is so wrong. I can hardly express my hatred of it.
that pidgeon is like pinkie pie after discord go to her
Yeesh what's with the politics
00,10Yes we have all seen the clip. But I dont buy it till I see the changed vesion in it's entirity. from the sorce.
eqd post has 200 comments already
your opinion is wrong critickitten
and she never said derpy
They edited Fantasia.
Her old voice was better
It was racist.
oktakon: Oh, lod looney toons? Got changed ALL the time-- and there's still a lot you can't find in the original form.
Sumica: Doesn't matter to me either way.
/me still explodes with rage.
Sumica - it's on iTunes right now. be my guest and go download it
this is going to be the new thing: first bronies react to derpy, then bronies react to derpy being changed
I'll still have a copy of the original.
00,10And for the record the version from indemand and hubworld are unchanged.
oh god they did underp her eyes, its either a Very good fake or real
same
you just got Sarge'd
Why did they make a WAR episode anyway?
Though I must say that I don't think this is a bad change.
lol that about covers the options phase4
also, Seth said he was redownloading the HD version to check himself
RvB reference FTW
And I think ponies are being way too whiny here.
<_<
someone with an itunes account check this and write an angry letter if its real
seth does have the bad habit of posting things before confirming however
She likes older men
00,10exactly maxderp
If they keep messin with derpy I might just forgot about my tolerant nature
not sure if it will actually let me grab the ep, but ill look
poynchan and /mlp/ are in a uproar though.
chaos, chaos everywhere.
ponychan*
whiny? this is the worst thing ever ;)
I have an iTunes copy of the original, too.
dat watch
And then Hasbro was picketed
The brony community is raging right now.
Yakko is a relative of Discord
ok I am done venting for the night gonna go play some tf2 blow of some steam later guys
K_A: backup that and then redownload
inb4 large portions of the fandom send angry letters to Hasbro and thus make the situation worse and negatively impact the fandom
Hold the protest rage people, it might not be them.
Oh wait.
Voice change? ok. NO LONGER called by name? yeah...
Awkward
Fleabath
DOUBLE ZIGGERS
discord approved chaos
Marx: Her name is Ditzy Doo.
>_>
That's the canon, in-show name.
bald bald!
And you just know these complainers were anonymous.
Derpy was a *fan* nickname.
DERPY, ITS DERPY
That may be her new official name now...
man they probably will get angry letters over the change
I'm not sure why people need this explained to them still.
:'(
what happened to derpy?
truly angry
and then they will realize ithat you cant make everyone happy.. it will be a moment of maturity and growing up
O_O
FUCK ditzy do, ITS DERPY HOOVES AND ITS CANNON SO NOP
I like how all the voices in this show are impressions that no kid would ever understand.
But srsly, why did they make an army episode?
CriticKitten: I was shocked it aired, myself. I thought it would be Ditzy Doo. I mean the word "derp" originates from South Park, and it's only as ableist as "klutzy" or, well, "ditzy."
diapers
No, canon was Ditzy. Derpy was canon in all of one episode, and writing canon that violates prior canon is kind of not smart
why not?
tattos
tatoos**
But I can live with it.
Good point
derp
woo still got my 1080p download with her called derpy
i am making so many backups
eww 1080p
They never indetified who was Ditzy do though
Ditzy was mentioned in one episode too critickitten
I think every early 90s cartoon ever did that.
Phase4: Will do. I want to see this in higher quality from a trustworthy source.
00,10Dat postal joke
I don't know if I'm late, but Justin Bieber has been converted and he's singing in a future episode.
Twilight, get my rope.. we're going to Yamino's house.
Mailmen FTW
CriticKitten-- Technically, Ditzy Doo was NEVER defined. Merely mentioned in one episode. Many assumed a certain background pony was said pony-- many others named her Derpy-- but Ditzy was never confirmed or canon. Derpy, in a nod to the fans, was.
K_A: Same. I was excited when they said it, and as time passed I grew disappointed because it meant that they'd thrown out older canon.
CriticKitten - canon was a pony named Ditzy Doo. It WASN'T canon that Derpy and Ditzy were one in the same
i'm not pointing finger yet Everlasting_Joy that was probably itunes but i can't be sure of that
That's splitting hairs and you all know it.
we never actually saw who Ditzy was
You're trying much too hard to deny reality.
all the way to china
CriticKitten - when you consider that Derpy wasn't able to be formally acknowledged until episode 15, not really
Your wrong critic
I've got this episode on DVD, I'ma go watch Retsupurae
>reality
Bye guys
>a cartoon
anypony still watching the show:(?
also i still have my 1080p original so~
nope
00,10I am
Take care StinkomanFan.
episode 11 was shipped and printed before they had a chance to make Derpy intentional
im watching kinda
No, I'm not. The original presentation of the character was as Ditzy. This "well technically we didn't SEE her" nonsense is just denial.
That's the worst thing about it, they never came to the fandom, they just went straight to Hasbro.
to late now
Night Stink and he left
HA HA HA HA
TheGreatAndPowerfulT I agree.
If you want to believe denial, that's fine, but don't perpetuate it as fact.
Never mind, twas a troll.
It's not.
They never confirmed who ditzy was and derpy was confirmed
yea wtf.. i remember on eqd they had a post from some guy who worked at the dvd printing place saying that there was no changes
Groan.

00,10some white guyyyyyyyyyyyy
Pool Toys
:$
Derpy was NEVER confirmed.
but why
YES SHE WA
*WAS
;A;
uh huh, sure critic
????0/10
When Apple changed their iTunes logo everyone complained and apple was all "I think it looks good". Why couldn't Hasbro do that?
I LIKE CHEESE
The new episode was the first canon use of her name EVER.
poor derpy
dont u try to deny what i saw with my own eyes!!! 6_9
CriticKitten is absolutely right :P
EXACTLY CANON USE
<__<
however
You are really hotly in denial here.
THEY SAID DERPY
I don't if she called dizty though
Scootaloo
I love animaniacs, even though i haven't seen them in years
mind*
oh CriticKitten stop trollin'
scootaloo<<
http://youtu.be/X2CRjPO73Dg?t=1m22s eyes are still a little derped here
not a pony
but they had to change her voice?
Tovler: sadly we can't be sure it was hasbro
naaah it's Pinkie pie
this is epic
vid links, whats the verdict in this situation?
00,03dem pings
Chicken boo
the voice wasnt too bad, the original VA wasnt fully informed
chicken boo?! what the hell I never saw no fucking chicken boo
but the eyes and name is just plain wrong
Hasbro requested that the episode be taken down.
:D
i still think of the derpy from the doctor whooves videos
the new voice is unemotional
She was called Ditzy in an episode before that. She was called Derpy by the fanbase, and they CHANGED HER NAME to Derpy to please the fans in a S2 episode. To keep suggesting that they are somehow different when they aren't is just....dishonest.
Scoota-loo
chicken boo, youre not a man youre a scoota-loo
damn that poor video so much dislikes
Itunes is now not canon
Chicken
WHERE THE CHICKEN
never seen that many on a pony video
CriticKitten, which episode
oops, I forgot to dislike it. brb
all og them
/me puts quarters in the mods-do-something jar
give me the actual episode shes called ditzy
thats not how it worked... ditzy never explicitly refered to 6_9
Bjorn: If the truth is trolling, I'll stick to trolling. :p
theres Scootaloo
Ditzy was never confirmed and to prove my point AEIOU
i dont lke this whole derpy thing
Dude! What are we watching?
ahahaha
Winter Wrap Up?
this is why i've always held the personal belief that her name is Ditsy "Derpy" Doo :3 derpy is a nickname!
Cornel sanders :D
SHE is never called ditzy
Animaniacs
AH
Like food
I can't listen to that voice. It's so wrong. Derpy's voice is suppose to be silly. If the original came out, the original is canon.
VinylScratch: theres nothing to say thats not how itis
South Lost cause of Scootaloo
^
Ugh, new blood is in deeeeeeep denial here. Unfortunately I'm not going to keep repeating myself ten thousand times only to have you keep shouting "NO YOUR WRONG" when we both know I'm not.
simila idear here, but no confirm either way so meh
this episode is racist as hell
down with the yankees
Bon Bon?
How
big earss!!
Dem ears
That guy has huge ears
CriticKitten: It's not truth because you do not have any absolute facts.
The I just don't know what went wrong was delivered horribly.
racist? how
Animniacs as never know for being PC
The dude with big ears is a classic cameo in WB cartoons. Forget his name.
By your logic I'm going to go ahead and name her Happy Gilmore
Nobody here has "absolute facts", that's the whole reason the debate is occurring in the first place
:|
Racist against chickens?
O cornel sanders you so silly
What about Bon Bon? her voice hasn't stayed the same between episodes, much less seasons.
Ugh, forget it. You ponies are being ridiculous and it's not worth my time.
are you bucking kidding me
that Scootaloo
Sure
holy crap that is a big chicken
leave Scootaloo alone!
*sigh* im back, sorry all that Derpy talk kinda made me sad :(
silly scootaloo dad, you cant fly
iTunes wont sell me the MLP eps if i actually show im from UK
o-o
and that's how KFC got started
yes!!! animaniacs!!!!
who's pickin on scootaloo?
/me looks at name "Oh, lemme fix that".
00,10i might still ad it's only the itunes version that was changed if at all.
I vote Courage next
Nerd_Sixpack but Bon Bon hasn't been acknowleged in canon.
good night bronies I'm goin to bed
critickitty your a fuckign idiot
I never KFC was formed by a confederate cornel
Darf14: i'm still crying inside...
ah man it's over :S

If you want to rage and whine and moan about a change that, frankly, isn't that offensive and probably wouldn't have been necessary if they just hadn't bothered making the changes in the first place, be my guest.
you know whats annoying? relating the term Derp with a mental problem THATS ANNOYING
Sumica: Has it recently broadcasted on The Hub?
That's better.
Well at least The DVD have the original
badda boom!
"Stay coo" :D
Derp is just Derp
well....at least its only I tunes so
i wouldnt be to against changing it to a female voice, whats on the itunes copy is just wrong. doesnt match the situation
also derpy was a shout out to the brony community
00,10K_A i have the indemand loaded right now.
yay:(
oh nvm more animaniacs
00,10it's unchanged.
Yay :)
ill brb....
The internet will still have the correct version floating around.
Sumica: Ah, yes, I forgot about that thing.
:D
00,10as is the hubworld version
Can I request a kick on the newblood who is incapable of talking in a civil tone without throwing cursing at me, please?
hello bronystate!
huzzah!!
the 1st version is still downloadable and on youtube so y u so bitchy
so it might be an apple covering their own asses version
work always makes me miss the movie night :'(
dottie <3
We just have to see which version of the last roundup will air on TV
i saw a cupcake
epic sax guy
as opposed to a change of episode
:O
Bill clinton is epic sax guy:O
00,10exactly rigth now it looks like it's just apple covering there flanks
YES
yeah!!!
PInkie:O
narf!
OH FUCK YES!
I guess we'll still have possible red-eyed Vinyl or canonized names to look forward to.
YAY
boo apple
Pinkie pie, you are so random
OF COURSE
K_A: is it downloading?
PINKIE AND THE BRAIN!
hmm.... I wonder....*googles Pinkie pie and brain*
WOOOHOOOO
this im still annoyed at cause i cant get the real episode if i want to give them money
hmm
insane. yup thats pinkie
.....dang, that has already been done
Magic?
it actually could just be that if the hubworld version is unchanged
Aw, I thought this was the episode where the Warners went to Hell.
that would also explain why the acting is just horrible
dat bold
as is the soundwork
O-O
HOW MAKE BOLD
oh, sorry, i can't do that either? xD; habit
Camelot
VinylScratch: yeah, whats with rd's voice
Tovler Yeah, I'm hoping they canonize some of our fanon names to background ponies in future episodes.
look out, a LV 90 wizard
Phase4: Not yet. Let me just go ahead and admit that until I get money from my new job, I can't actually go on iTunes and buy ponies.
did anyone confirm that the episode is unchanged in the itunes version?
horrific EQ on the new voice, and RD's voice is painlfully redone
Those names.
apple threw someone with a semi-decent voice in to change things around
YOKO ONO...da fuck
chip n dale
lol
Oh hiliarry clinton, still relevant
PAULA ABDUL

its hard to tell with the audio problems on youtube copy
maxderp, the only place it HAS changed is itunes

The VA is fine.
Ohfour how funny that is if you ask me.
everywhere else is still showing the original ep
"Derpy is no longer Derpy" post - 379 comments in 33 minutes

K_A: awww, fair enough though
Oh yeah, and whenever I do get on iTunes, i will NOT put it on my Windows machine directly. I'll use a virtualized environment.
I have original ep
I didnt listen to the change, I couldnt bring myself to see it
The hackjob on RD's voice....a bit weaker though.
discord approved shitstorm
PIE
pie
LOL
K_A: linux brony?

Magic creates PIE!!!!
But it's not "painful". Why are ponies trying to turn this into something it's not?
Equestrian Pie
apple pie
PIE
penguin pony?!
The pie is Pinkie Pie flavor!
K_A, i have a 2nd os install for that, so nothing apple based ever goes through my main install even virtually
Phase4: Yeah, I'm using Linux Mint Debian Edition on my server and laptop on Win7 on my desktop.
wow, i'm about 10 seconfs behnd everyone else
still love Pinkie's accent
CriticKitten - it's the principle of the matter
About the only characters I know they can't name is Colgate and Dr. Hooves.
dat tail
But now derpy also belongs to these nameless complainers.
00,10This is my pie and I'am gonna eat it!
Hasbro is too afraid of controversy over "Derpy"
/me hugs K_A "linux bronies are best bronies"
QUICK EVERYONE RIP EPISODE 14 before hasbro decides to replace them.
I forgot that I set "linux" tp ping me o.o

I was under the impression that all versions were changed, lol
Hooray! I succedded at winning the missioN!
Mirror: No, Han shot first was a "principle of the matter" thing. This is just a change in VA and a poor hackjob on a prior voiceover.
this is going to sound so bad but now she is just... a stereotypical blonde ... ._.
magic? in pinkie and the brain? what madness is this
eeyup
i have no idea what everyone's talking about...
we can't even fight these egocentric people who think "derpy" is addressing them.
dat music
Sumica - Sethisto has viewed the episode himself
Sumica, it's just the principal that ONE person managed to get this changed.
Pinkie songs are best songs :D
sorry, Linux, you didn't meet all the mission requirements
is the dvd with that ep out yet?
Why does 614 sound familiar...I feel like that I a reference to something
Like I said, its only itunes, so as long as the others dont change then im happy
She will always be Derpy to us. No matter what happens, Derpy is ours.
that pisses me off.
Pinky is best Minstral
Now and forever.
Did I just hear my name?
I've tried a LiveUSB of Linux when my hard drive didn't have a boot sector. Never again.
(hmm, troll Hasbro by saying Derpy offends them as a blonde)
/me pings Rain
/me glomps TopHat
oh wait he said BBrain
00,10So far it's the itunes version changed.
isnt it 613

isn't it 616?
apple have done something very dangerious if it really is covering their own asses

It doesn't change anything about the character at all. >_>
I'm still ripping the original eiposde
hello Ponibas and emangamer
I want it to Rain!
Um... Underped eyes...?
boom
lol, ohai
They strightened out her eyes man
Rain: everything is coming along nicely
Except that she's not explicitly called Derpy, which is....not meaningful.
HER EYES.
dat dent
RD: Is this some kind of cruel joke?!
thats good emangamer
Oh, you mean like how they were originally?
Hey bronystate.
Am I the only one who thinks of Pinkie Pie everytime Pinkie is mentioned?
Marx: 1m22s is not underped
oh... hasbro is going to get a shitstorm for this in the morning
but then we'd have a green haired derpy.
They underped her eyes.
hey Placebo
hey, Placebo
hey fakedrug
Placebo: hi Placebo
Don't forget to bring Fluttershy:'(
CriticKitten - they "originally" were not straightened, a la Season 1 Episode 1
Sounds liek a mission for fluttershy
that's what enraged me
You mean Pinky?
i'm a little teapot short and stout
Executive Professional Integrity sucks
pinkie pie and twilight
I just don't know what went wrong..
Are ponies just not aware of the fact that her "derp eyes" was an animation error and they were originally perfectly normal, only changed by fan request?
CriticKitten thats not the point thats causing so much anger, derpy is seen as a big shout out to the brony community from the makers themselves
charlie sheen?!
^
winning
CriticKitten - and Feeling Pinkie Keen was an animator error too?
Regardless I'm still ripping the original episode before hasbro shits over youtube.
CriticKitten: The change in itself is not a big deal. The problem is that people were pressuring for this change in a way that I'm afraid may have bothered the show producers. There were some violent hate mails sent that started this whole thing.
they're retconning now
Because changing them back to normal eyes pretty much just changes nothing
Charlie SHeen
Tovler yeah, that's what I meant :$
Unicorn
Unicorn!
unircorn!!!
Aw
retconning is extremely dangerous with a ravid fanbase

I'm surprised they won't/ haven't changed that.

And yes, it was a shout-out of appreciation, which alone made it a significant event. It really is the principle of the thing.
my god, animaniacs + mlp:fim
witch
Because that's what ponies in here are suggesting.
haha!
lol
CriticKitten: that was the REASON she got noticed, the Derpy Eyes and now it's gone. It's basically saying "Hey bronies, fuck you"
Because THAT will totally fix it.
burned! *rimshot*
I know that Bugs Bunny ep!

Ya know, folks, when you go to bed tonight.....

hiay Phase1 you a friend of Phase4?

dearprincess :i didnt learn snything
When she looks in on Dash in the hole, the eyes are underped.

verata!
AttackWithHugs: inb4 someone posts that same link to the EqD thread

My Black History Month picks were Man on Fire and The Last Dragon, but alas.
telling pinkie to be quiet. thats impossibru
they're also underped when she knocks down the poll, and when RD comes out of the hole.
doing that right now and sadly you're right
people in the yayponies channel are saying its changed
CriticKitten: Exactly
Fight it
Cheeeseeee
though I supposed "fixed" isn't the right word.
cheese
they're "altered
Heck, somepony should. May as well be a kitty.
throw the cheeeese
"
altered is a good term
fixed implyis an improvment
Brain put his faith in blast hardcheese
also, I have to go apologize to a yt commenter I think
err....that wasnt my movie otakon, it was someone else
asfd
CriticKitten: I mean I'm upset about the Derpy change as well, but I'm not losing my balls over it. Yes, I do prefer the original voice but that's because it added to her clumsiness , that's how I always saw her.
:D
Darf14: oh really? oh well nvm
haha hes the big cheese now!
cheese head
I say we ignore this development, and any time we play Last Roundup, we use the original version. Because fuck this.
Wisconsinite
agreed
GO PACKERS!
indeed
packers won the super bowl!
agreed again.
ROGERS! Discout double check
XD
COURAGE
but why do I have a feeling they aren't going to put Derpy in any more episodes now
AttackWithHugs: I don't mind the new voice. It does seem catered to better match what fanon voiceover work had assumed her voice might sound like.
PONKIE PIE
:o
:D
:) dat enthusiasm
Now I can finally go to bed, c ya bronies
CriticKitten: I don
Though it may not be the best VA who did it, it's not quite as bad as the non-mane VAs.

IS OVER
NONOONONONONONONo! The ranndom drawing already happened!

i dislike it just for the fact aht it was fan service and had to change it on the grounds of one person complaining
c ya bronies I'm goin to bed
I'm gonna get the cheapest IF front-end I can get for my PC and build a TRNG myself.
otakon I think the best thing to do in that regard is see how this plays out.
BYE
maybe they will but for very shorts seconds and without any major role
so whats the showing next week?
they WILL
otakon: I get the feeling Studio B is still going to slip her in in the background. But as far as speaking roles in the future? Shit out of luck.

DERPY
and now derpy partially belongs to these random complainer whom we can't confront.
My deoderant must smell great to him. >.>
I'm off to watch the late late show now
inb4 Hasbro claps down on Studio B
I still think the Roseluck VA change was far more insane.
CriticKitten, that's hillarious.
dem birds
couragecouragecourage
CriticKitten: damn typo. I like the new voice as well, but the old one is sticking to me because of how adorable she sounds. My friend's sister was blind from birth, but when the episode first came out, I didn't find it offensive at all. A little weird, yes. But not offensive.
...can't blame him, it DOES smell pretty good
STALKROO
But it's a bit weird.
Also, I actually wish they kept Bon Bon's first voice. It was *perfection.*
clamps damn it
YA
my dog did that too
Magnets, how do they work? :S
hey Luna you still streaming dear or is that all for tonight?
07,01goodnight everypony that's all for me... can't keep me eyes open :)
the poor pegasus sounded deaf.
Night, Luna
A friend and I have agred on this long ago... Trying to amuse the bronies is a losing propistion. It gets the Studio in trouble, and frankly, we liked the show just fine bfore they knew about us.
seriously, It's not even that I think the whole "derpy is offensive" think is bullshit. It's that it's out-and-out censorship.
Bye Luna.
night
night luna!
Gnight
0,14later Luna
good night luna
night Luna
How do magnets work? Easy, this is how they work...... Aliens
night luna!
Luna: sleep well dear, take care of yourself and feel better soon!
I should get some sleep, too, though I get the feeling I'll be up coding again.
Night Luna. Thanks for the stream.
Wow, I am typo king.
/me hugs Luna goodnight
00,03Goodnight Luna!
night Luna
nite Luna
night loonya
They trap negative and positive gravity on both ends
hurr durr
You can change as much as you want before you put something out there, but when you go back because some people got pissy? Fuck that. Fuck that hard.
o-o no more cartoons?
AttackWithHugs: I will say the hackjob on RD's voiceover in that scene is a bit weak, and the VA isn't perfect. But it's not badVA , the animation still looks quite clean for having been adjusted, and I was of the opinion that the name change was a poor idea from the start anyways. So I'm sorta like "yeah I can see why ponies might be mad, but srsly, chill"
i consider the stereotypical blonde more offensive than derpy ... ._.
'night luna, thanks for the stream :D
It could've been worse

night Luna
yes
florence and the machine!
:) Love this vid!
red line!
Luna: thanks for the stream dear
whos streaming now?
00,03You just HAD to put this before I went to sleep...
yay:[
what the buck was that?
Cosmic Love
RAWRity: It sucks, but let's be honest. The show has to go to lowest common denominator. They are ni the business of making money. The quality is higher than damn near any cartoon of its ilk.
Then we'd have to complain that Twilight shot first.
my god...this PMV IS AMAZING!!!!!
this pmv is so good
CriticKitten: It does, though it was weird not hearing RD say "Derpy". Like it was a LITERAL last-minute job
whats wrong Scoot-Scootaloo
lawl, no sleep for the scoots is there
twilight sparkle ....... twilight... twilight eclipse
you dont like this song?
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/51948537/Screenshot%20-%20250212%20-%2016%3A18%3A27.png
Twilight Princess. :o
like I said
00,03I love this song...
^_^
This PMV is awesome!
me too
yeah yeah. the sqeaky wheel gets the oil.
they even "corrected" her eyes
twilight sparkle reduces my hate for twilight mums, i pretend theyr actually big MLP fans
LOL
I wonder how long till RD gets some kind of dye job
AttackWithHugs: Yeah. It's a bit odd. The scene is still pretty charming and adorable though.
so whats the streaming schedule for next week?
rofl
So hardcore (hardcore meme guy)
<3
bc somebody complains of the rainbow coloring and her tomboy behaviour loud enough
But it wasn't the best part of that ep anyways, that episode belonged to Pinkie Pie
btw... heres the persona meme if anyone bored http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/ponysona.png
ALTAIR
Well, a person with an actual face complained about RD and she survived.
wuna
otakon Oh no. . .
yh, but she was a reviewer
CriticKitten: "I just don't know what went wrong!" meanwhile, the ice castle is fully engulfed in flames
and rd's tone is completly wrong
hi
its g3 tone
03o:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Pinkie Twinkle?
<3
When people talk about being big fans of Twilight, I first think of Twilight Sparkle. My mind FancultManager class applies an automatic filter to the returned QuerySet of possible references.
pinky you made me think it was about the game
and that was in the early days of the show
03:o!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
/me runz
before it became popular really
ALTAIR
/me cant wait for the third Fluttershy ep in the history of FiM
what
/me hugs
the heck
whut...
haven't seen you for ages
I...have returned.
So, what's the movie?
Simple. RD is not an object of ridicule. The idiots complaining took Derpy as an object of ridicule.
Its livess
Buytoast alraedy finished

Buytoast you are a little late
poniponiponiponiponiponiponiponiponiponiponiponiponiponiponi

According to the name chart, my name is Purple Candy

Oh i was so hyped
:S

03Crap D:
looks like it
So, I think I'm a bit in the dark. I know that Derpy's name was something other people was like "Raglfraglgrabl change it a grglbrgl!", but was it any particular group that did it?
The Worst Possible Thing;)
aww... :'(
ah well i can wait
we are being a bit pessimistic right here we don't know for sure what will happen next
Anybody read/listened to the reading of Equestrian Pie?
so whos streaming now

At least I can sleep in tomorrow.
StormChaser: no one atm

:(
but thats cause i turned it down to do something quick
/me sigh
*gives a hug to YourLittleDashie*
:D:):(:S:P
anyone want to see my da page- dang the graphics are awesome for its age
alright
i saw derpies scene....
<3 Swordfish
D'aww Zappy
i cried
TheGreatAndPowerfulT well it's not like it's a small plot hole.
inb4 20,000 bronys draw pictures of derpy and mails them to Hasbro.
00,10Um parallellogic|dA Same VA
anyway let's just watch this anime thingy cow boy space guy and talk about it later~
but yeah, "New derpy" isn't derpy. It's a robot trying to replace derpy.
Yamino?
hazzah, thanks
SilverStreak: not just you bro..
look at this
lol Cylon Derpy
i'm crying too
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZjmVk_9UNI&feature=endscreen&NR=1
These ragers could kill the show for us if their not careful.
SilverStreak: when I heard Rainbow Dash say Derpy's name, It made my Saturday.
00,10Also voiced Roger smith in Big O
I kinda liked Yamino's art though...albeit hypocritical on the artist
I watched the episode when it first aired on the TV.
Random question
what downside(s) is there to an open relationship?
and the Season 3 Opener will be the Mane 6 realizing this, and going on a quest to find Derpy in all her wall-eyed glory.
Preggers
it made my life
00,10Hey guys good news. We have the un changed ep here so stop fretting over it.
ooh, i should dowload Big O
Video I found http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZDyCT8yJR8&feature=related
i'm insulted they changed it all. they're saying it
I'm just saying that people who rage too much, might kill the show for us.
Big O...
s not ok to be different
literally.
i should download that to..
maby thats why ep is delaied, give us time to cool down
Who's Yamino?
Pervy old men
dat ass
so RAWRity how is your fic going ?
00,10And at this point only Itunes has changed it. So rage at them not at Hub or hasbro.
Red Eye
Even if they delete the scene, won't change the fact that it originally was like how it was.
yep maybe
Im not worried about the change, since I pira- *cought* torre- *hack wheeze* err...borrowed the episode from a unknows source :)
YourLittleDashie: Mr.Poniator makes some pretty funny videos IMO.
People should jsut keep that in mind instead of raging and making asses out of everyone.
heh
now would be a good time to announce that Season 3 is the final season and is only 13 episodes. y'know since we're already feeling down.
Sumica, that's what these enraged bronies aren't understanding.
Meanwhile, gunfight
it looks like apple covering their asses, not hasbro bowing to pressure from people quick to write letters
poor applejack http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzDs4HHh96g
/me brohoofs Darf14
*brohoof*
So they changed Derpy's voice.
Tovler: Like a crip said, "i got way too many blues for anymore bad news."
PinkySpice no vid links during stream
which is why I'm fearing the shows production because of these idiots.
Beserk mode on
Ah ha. welp.
unfoundbug: oh, sorry
creepy face
Dat Face
And they even removed any instance of Derpy's name.
Dat sand
:( I knew I should have had that hamburger pizza.
RAWRity: let me know as soon as you have it online~ i could use a good reading~
What a shame.
i'm disabled and OFFENDED that they changed it
Rawket: You mean all one of them?
what happened?
RawketLawnchair: we agreed not to talk about it for now
this is going to be a very repetitive weakend isnt it
o.o
00,10eeyup
Also, this might just be me being paranoid...but on the altered line, where RD no longer says Derpy's name...does it sound like a different voice actress?
if u hang around any place which discusses mlp, yes
or u could wait it out
Tovler: i havent opened my twi pinklestia set, perhaps i'll keep it like this for a few days
Blank_Flank: Derpy has been "corrected" in The Last Roundup, that is all I will say.
bunker down for the weekend and this will all have blown over
RAWRity that's what I thought too.
maxderp - no it won't
00,10otakon a line like that is why people are jumping to conclusions
They even removed her derp eyes. . .
I swear, I should just not be in chat for the entire weekend. I'm going to get annoyed eventually from people getting way too upset about something so pointlessly minor. >.>
Shesh.
I think they just added a weary sigh and changed the mouth animation
Sumica: okay, altered
sigh
im afraid
bang there heads
D:
yay
if they indeed say that season 3 is the las one i could get a good money for pinklestia ._.
.-.
no like, listen to it, and then the original. SOunds like a different voice.
yay
Blank_Flank: just don't worry about it for now.
<3 Swordfish
wow, that line made me hungry
fluttershy? where is that coming from?
Sumica: where you get this version of Bebop, the picture quality is REALLY good
RAWRity: i think it's another voice indeed
ok
Speaking of hunger, I need to get a midnight snack. brb.
Colt_Magnum: Sumica's ping, he's streaming
we are now at 74 minutes since the announcement, and the post has gained 736 comments
00,10It's the remastered dvd's
yay :)
Bionic Comando?

"Derpy has been corrected" is garnering 1 comment every 6 seconds
Sumica: nice man, very nice
heh, they should have announced White lestia toy today.

yay
what do u mean by sumicas ping?
yays are out of sync
so...what the hell? Did they rush it with Asleigh in the studio real quick, or did they get another VA to try and copy her?
too much yay :()
its when people say sumic@ get it?
What exactly did Yamino say? >_>

00,10you say my name my irc say yay~
ooh ic.
I think it might be the second case
lol
dem choco flakes
and I didnt say it because stop killing the stream audio XD
RAWRity if they got someone else to do it, then that would mean one thing
Sumica. :P
ahaha
want it back?
because honestly I'm not sure that, even rushing, Asleigh would sound THAT different.
I guess Ashleigh forgot the pitch of the original line. An easy mistake to make.
dont be a dick Colt_Magnum :p
i knew it he was gonna steal
thieves guild
Either that or it wasn't her.
Ace thief
yay
the gray fox

if you know what i mean
00,10it's ok Rain if they abuse it i turn it off.
iTunes hired someone to cover it.

about 10s lag here too
D'aww *heart starts to melt*
dat boost
when you ping Sumi, atleast have something to say
MY HEADPHONES!!
it's not the audio quality. Like, the BG music sounds perfectly fine, as do the sound effects.

it is bad or that just youtube messing with the quality
lets call sumi, sumi unless we want to hear flutters
or does that trigger ping too?

lol my nick for Sumi is now being used because people keep spaming him
