AND everyone lived happily ever after!
Most of the character development, and the basic plot synopsis are in the series. But understanding the plotline of the film doesn't require it.
everyone that lived

This is harder to understand than Inception...
there is no worst pony
^ Luna
they had to kill wash
i understands it
INCEPTION WASN'T AHRD TO UNDERSTAND
not mindless zombies, just... controlable.
IT WAS FUCKIGN SIMPLE
Yes they do... That's one reason why Halo is awesome
Inception isn't that hard, once you understand the levels
Inara <3
Makes ya think dont it?
BALDWIN
This movie, I mean.
inceptions is NOT AHRD AT ALL
You need a 8 in INT to understand Inception
I haven't even watched Inception.
inception was just kinda dumb
NOrmal
choice*
Luna: normal
speed
just wondering when the sequel is, Incipio means beginning
normal creds
Normal for the music
Luna: the music is wonderful

Is Summer Glau a main character in the series?
08,01because msuic

Back in time for movie night... sorta :p
Buck's VA is Jayne
0,14nope
they even modeled the characters faces of the actual people
River isn't that attractive
We don't accept creds here I need something more real
0,14Buck's VA is Nathan Fillion
The crazy psychic?
PRESS Z OR R TWICE
Saxy: I checked IMDB
is it at least Glenfiddich?
You should see her in a different roll. she is well nice.
Bucks VA is Nolan North
but shes adorkable
oh cool, last roundup is back on itunes
0,14IMDB lies, check Fillion's wiki
sadly no. soemthing named Teacher's

I'm american, and I honeslty hate my country.
ugggh
00,10oh hey that's right i have hub indemand.
but it's NOT DERPY
They... they didn't...
I think that we need to email 'The Hub' to start syndicating this.
WWI
animation+manias=animaniacs
....I do not want to live on this planet anymore
maniacs*
the first one was Derpy
awwwww yeah dem pigeons

Everybody hates their own country you know
/me is not buying the dvd/bluray if its that version
yeah AMERICA
this one is like some sad imitation
wat, dat history
I already hate apple
did he just say bitch
yeah
hi
badda bing!
yes
my helmet
well......at least we have the unedited version
EQD post
yup
for now
well maybe not apple as whole but the itunes store
no more derpy
I demand an answer!
cool whip somethings up
.-.
00,10Coo it
meh map
is the last roundup still uneditied in the dvd coming out?
everything in america always offends someone.
that's all I'm gonna say.
honestly
I got my HD version of it already but I want to buy the DVD to show support
anyhoo. I'm out. Gonna work on more of my D&D campaign and then get some sleep.
its a pretty bad edit
probably not even gonna open it
aw man, and I feeling sleepy too. stupid rage.
night guys
Her voice is missing the adorable drawl, now.
bc it's not Derpy
I dont know if the dvd is gonns be changed I think I remember hearing it isnt hopefully not that would suck
night everypony.

Hey guys, how's the picture coming?
http://i.imgur.com/Zsu0m.jpg
haven't seen this in ages
Well guys I gotta take a shower. It was really fun. Ciao!
Well, I doubt they'd have been able to change the episode on the DVD, seeing as they've already MADE them.
a gyro
that progress
Alright night everypony
Night everypony
good drawing
maybe I should order it now just in case, I dont geel like they would change it that fast
Night Luna
00,03I'm the hero that Gotham needs...
voice change is acceptable imo, shame they removed the name though :'(
Have fun with the post-show
....
lol dictionary
wtf
07,01night LTB
You can't have this bomb. It's mine.
seriously?
they would have had to have done a recall of all of them, and reprint them. Lotta money and time, which means they'd have to delay release to accomplish it.
stinkin hole!
which we dont
It's not the best VA but it's not all that awful.
no it's NOT THAT'
yes it's awful
00,10Gonna check indemand and see if that version is changed too.
at least that hamburger pizza slice I had was orgasmic.
00,03Something about that voice seemed... bad
they went back and CHANGED IT that's the point
This isn't as extreme, though, as Rose/Roseluck from last ep.
it's like if they went back and removed Porkie Pig's stutter
The fact that Derpy has crossed eyes is fanservse.
heh didn't imagine something like this could possibly "offend" any group. Guess it did somehow...
i feel kind of dissapointed thaat they removed derpy's name, it's like our pleas to leave her the way she is was kinda ignored
hmm...whats going on right now ???
Ponies are flipping out over nothing.
oh
Ohey Animaniacs
^
It's on EQD
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/02/derpy-has-been-modified.html#more

eqs has'
thats a shame

<_<
I really apreciated the goodfeathers as a kid but now they are awesome
sigh
00,10like I said.
i meant Never really lol derpy
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
00,10has any one seen it for them selves or just a clip?
haha war haha
all the time*
yea i agree... its feeling a bit like communist china in here all the sudden
next week
dat censorship
I feel like they are pandering to a vocal minority.
man that voice i just can't.. damn i think it just dont fit her
they are pandering to a vocal minority
The voice change is somethign else, naturally.
i said earlier, i know for a fact they chanced a Looney Tunes Episode
Cream colored ponies and crisp apple strudels
Doorbells and sleighbells
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
These are a few of my favorite things
Also they cut some of RD's lines
I heard the voice and that is not derpy
Yeesh what's with the politics
00,10Yes we have all seen the clip. But I dont buy it till I see the changed vesion in it's entirity. from the sorce.
eqd post has 200 comments already
and she never said derpy
They edited Fantasia.
It was racist.
/me still explodes with rage.
00,10And for the record the version from indemand and hubworld are unchanged.
same
you just got Sarge'd
Why did they make a WAR episode anyway?
Though I must say that I don't think this is a bad change.
RvB reference FTW
And I think ponies are being way too whiny here.
<_<
someone with an itunes account check this and write an angry letter if its real
She likes older men
If they keep messin with derpy I might just forgot about my tolerant nature
poynchan and /mlp/ are in a uproar though.
ponychan*
whiny? this is the worst thing ever ;)
dat watch
Hold the protest rage people, it might not be them.
Oh wait.
Voice change? ok. NO LONGER called by name? yeah...
Awkward

That's the canon, in-show name.

DERPY, ITS DERPY
I'm not sure why people need this explained to them still.

O_O
I like how all the voices in this show are impressions that no kid would ever understand.
But srsly, why did they make an army episode?
why not?

But I can live with it.
Good point

That's splitting hairs and you all know it.
You're trying much too hard to deny reality.

07,01goodnight everypony that's all for me... can't keep me eyes open :)
Night, Luna
seriously, It's not even that I think the whole "derpy is offensive" think is bullshit. It's that it's out-and-out censorship.
Bye Luna.

You can change as much as you want before you put something out there, but when you go back because some people got pissy? Fuck that. Fuck that hard.

These ragers could kill the show for us if their not careful.
I watched the episode when it first aired on the TV.
Preggers
i'm insulted they changed it all. they're saying it
literally.
i should download that to..
maby thats why ep is delaied, give us time to cool down
Who's Yamino?
Pervy old men
Even if they delete the scene, won't change the fact that it originally was like how it was.
yep maybe
heh
poor applejack http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzDs4HHh96g
*brohoof*
which is why I'm fearing the shows production because of these idiots.
Beserk mode on
creepy face
Dat Face
And they even removed any instance of Derpy's name.
Dat sand
:( I knew I should have had that hamburger pizza.
i'm disabled and OFFENDED that they changed it
this is going to be a very repetitive weakend isnt it
o.o
00,10eeyup
Also, this might just be me being paranoid...but on the altered line, where RD no longer says Derpy's name...does it sound like a different voice actress?
or u could wait it out
00,10otakon a line like that is why people are jumping to conclusions
They even removed her derp eyes. . .
Shesh.
I think they just added a weary sigh and changed the mouth animation
sigh
bang there heads
