I learned the theory, did some sketches, and then kind of just...stopped.
Yeah
There's one, two, and three point, generally.
Any more and it's too complicated.
you can, but they still have to follow the horizon most of the time
00,10and that's the tomslavh
They always do
13gave more depth
The only time, though, that the point isn't on the horizon, is in three-point.
thanks Ninjazz|Blood :'(
Then you get one to the bottom to simulate depth.

PONY. EYES.
Freaking annoying.
but its running on XP
/me parents still have a computer from 2003
/me 13is going in
/me is to
meh perspective annoys me more
/me 11,01is as well
Krypskytt
XP is good not 98 though...
Perspective is easy.l
1398 was okay
Perspective is rules.
first time I've seen someone use steam's ..translation
13ME was where it failed
aparently my work computer is still on =o
I'd join but i'd need to boot my desktop... and i really dont want too
if*
On my way :3
But for whatever God-unknown reason, eyes
13it's good that ME failed as hard as it did
I've been in Wrek's crosshairs before. He's one good sniper.
They elude me.
I used 98 SE for years after XP was released
13millenium edition
never used it
No stream? ;~;
Shizuka:the problem is this computer was designed for 98 ONLY
05its first joined first served
hello everyone
i see Wrek's Streaming
and full up
00,0295 and 98 i give leway to, they had a lot of limits to deal with and had some clever solutions
hello every one
oh too slow in joining
/me school still uses XP
eww
Hello everypony! :)
i used an ISO of it
I still maintain that perspective is easier.
I bought W7 for DX11
KEEEEL EEET
why are you using the bazaar Bargain?!!!
/me likes Vista and hopes people wont start crashing in o him
on
I would like to play tf2 but my laptop is out of commission
/me 11,01turns computer back off :<
He is.
brb
hi guys
11,01XP was solid.
hello every one
whose streaming
11,01I hope W8 fails.
?*
W8?
I hope W8 is JUST for tablets, and that it STAYS that way
/me laughs at Wrek's accuracy
00,10they are empty but yeah
W8 is just too ment for tablets
Sucks for every other platform
I'm currently joining Phase's other server. Well, one of them.
11,01Chrysalis wanted to do a Mann Up match.
I'll hop on that train.
hiding?
00,10I am cool with some mann up
My team fortress two just updated
woot woot
00,02or that
EA*
...
back
00,02cow334, valve has talked about the problems on xbox
i'm already in the other server :p
00,02microsoft litteraly wont let them
My TF2's just booting up
Talk of some Mann Up in manechat
11,01Phase4: Even if Valve made it paid DLC?
00,02cow334, not a clue, you'd have to look it up
00,02Nittany_Discord, i think thats the issue, valve dont wan to release it paid
I DONT HAVE A TABLET D:
00,02want'
/me enjoys EA's console games
I DONT WANT THAT TO HAPPEN
00,02cow334, they really should
11,01cow334: They're too greedy and too strict with the 360.
00,02and the fanbase of tf2 is MASSIVE
00,02sagas, its the same as when it was released
00,02sagas, that
it would be awesome
*table
00,10Chrysalis did you want to try mann up?
00,02Ponies47, they've already made it slow enough
00,10ah ok
Ponies47s computer then destroys itself with a fjnal message of "umad trolol"
yea i am not doing mann up mode like...ever, cause i dont want to pay
/me wonders why the sniper adds a laser sight to his rifle. Just gives position away
11,01But Valve doesn't want fans to pay for this.
05and that is why snipers are godlike
11,01M$ does.
00,02Vivix, they used to be a good company, now its full of morons
I haven't payd attention to the last few years- but that may be the case eyah-
yeah-
00,02make vista look like a success
... ._. i dont get it
/me laughs
Whos playing?
I kinda hope W8 is marketed as a tablet thing, and that they really don't think they can stop producing things for--work computers and such, that would just- hurt the company

well Dust514 is going to be Free to play, rather its going to be ... microtransactioned

just wondering
^
00,02all my terminals broke
00,02all of them
of course
00,02why are they broke
11,01It's just with Gamestop coming along that made them start punishing people for it.
i think EAS trying to improve the games but they arent doing a very good job
they should rather go after gamestop
On numerous levels.
00,10room for more in other server
Squallken:live
cool thnx
11,01EA is too stuck punishing and milking their fanbase for me to care about them.
00,02Kandarihu, computing power in tablets is incredible
00,02nowhere near pc's but still a fair ammount
Some thigns just aren't made for Tablets
DAWS are the modern age

00,02sonicandmario85, np ^_^
We are simsing togewther
Nittany_Discord:spore and pogo games are fun well atleast some of them are
11,01CriticKitten: Good luck. Can't even get gamers to boycott MW2.
00,10are you joining or not nitt?
11,01Sumica: Yes.
its like boy but cott
and its like pie
Hey, there are good Indie games. A lot of them are much more fun than mainstream titles.
It's expensive to release them fully
Indie is good- but a lot of it is hrr
consider valve, they need massive amounts of money to keep producing HL3
Money is Stupid!!! we must burn it and start a revolution!
Right now lets start a revolution
00,02they've done work to cause the problem
i wish i could play tf2 sadly i have no internets till i get a job
00,10yep
00,02cow334, nyx.ariscop.net spitfire.ariscop.net or applebloom.ariscop.net
00,02not sure how many people are on them
00,02cow334, password is ponies
deadspace
00,02ToR is aparently freking massive
$300 million dollars, man.
NONE.
11,01Dammit. TF2 is glitching again. Won't let me in.
They're doing it on spare time with tiny manpower, and cheap methods
00,02EA would charge you for a licence to run a server
11,01Don't have to pay for auth servers.
in*
00,02Nittany_Discord, http://derpy.me/bZPe2 some critisizim of ToR
i played TOR it was different
pretty standard mmo but i liked how they had full voice acting and environmental damage
11,01I think someone stole my spot/.
11,01Says 6/32 on both server.
Frankly, I think some games are getting the indie label without really deserving it. I don't know Torchlight, but Bastion comes to mind.
11,01*servers
00,02well, theres a third server
00,02not sure which two you guys are using
!
00,02Nittany_Discord, applebloom' :P
00,10again? he has not joined till just now
An indie company would probably be in some guys flat, while they all have jobs, in their spare time
TF2?
lol
"that was easy?"
=D
I've only heard bad things abou their worker relations-
00,02applebloom seems empty
sorry
11,01Unless they're sadists, they'd probably like to be working elsewhere.
No shit @Pal
11,01cratorkid: Or that.
00,02cow334, applebloom.ariscop.net , password is ponies
11,01Since they represent the company.
BLEH
of course in valves case you have several games being worked on by several people of intermingling groups
Dis song.
dat Rammstien
05this aint rammstein
11,01Yeah.
11,01Activision, too.
11,01Especially back in 2009.
11,01When Kotick "joked" about how he treated his developers.
that's why movies, games, tv shows are all estimated production costs
I haven't heard anything too bad from Lionhead Studios
"Joked"?
:(
That's not good at all
11,01Kotick is an asshole.
._. that is mean
even if he said it was a joke
hello everypony
WATS UP EVERYBODY!
11,01Trying to.
00,10FFS nitt while you rant you have 5 people waiting on you
11,01Sumica: I keep trying to join.
MvM/
?
My team fortress is still loading
11,01Don't worry about me and just play.
No we didn't, we're waiting for you.
My bucking computer won't run TF2
piece of sh*t
11,01Suffering from depression doesn't help.
did the grey man getted you?
I made excuses for why other companies NEED us to pay
Same here, Nittany_Discord.:(
Cave story beats Minecraft~
>o>

/me hugs Nittany
How do you become a mod?
To be honest, I wouldn't be surprised if EA's profits aren't trhough the roof
I'm in a lobby bymyself
._.
OH.
i think it should be there
ooo 224
Which might have been seen as "defending EA"
hello cute anthros http://derpy.me/iyTrH
11,01Thanks for the hugs.
Supposedly.
/me 11,01is still sad
/me 11,01likes, but is still sad
/me ruffles Nittany_Discord's mane :3
I'm horrible at it because I forget what's going on and just say things
BRB.
But they're loosing money because of it right?
wait some dlc is 20 bucks
THat's the best signal we can give, until something happens
thats kinda a lot
I'm not spending much money on games at all
Why are we aguring about this?
Goodgood-
Well, lemme correct myself.
We're just talking, I think
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m91kbtp1Yx1qzih6bo1_500.png
They actually produced a $60 product.
but that's mostly because I'm half out of gaming, and just waiting for thigns I recognize
11/11/11
Oh yeah, Skyrim
the last 3(?) games i bought we're all from Atlus
I did buy Inversion? even if it looks kinda bad, I liked that it had no subtitles
It's an issue that's often on Nittany_Discord's heart.
same XD
Skyrim is fun, though I don't actually have it
nice shot
I'm beginning to understand the issue around it, but I tend to go off on "Businesses deserve money" tangents when it's brought up
<_<
00,02Nittany_Discord, http://derpy.me/ZpvTy

00,02PillowPoni, fix laptops with duct tape

00,02cow334, its different
Spyyroooh
Frankly, I like the exploratory aspect of piracy. Download it if you're interested. If you like it, buy the official release. If you don't like it, don't.
I laughed at the valve one
00,02cow334, but even on the easy modes it would be epic hard
11,01I really should play it more.
00,02cow334, also not sure if it allows you tro
00,02to;
o.o
Hello all. :)
00,02LunarSS, probably right
:p
with 3 people it was damn near impossible
For some reason I never buy used games- I don't really like used thigns unless they're over 20-30 yers old
._. lol i fail
00,02PillowPoni, pull the hard drive from the one without a charger, problem solved :P
00,02cow334, i think you need 3
11,01Phase4: Saw that before.
11,01The pic you linked.
ugh
that i can join
Well, this isn't usually my type of music, but I kinda like it 0.o
00,02cow334, you could try the autojoin thing but its usualy full
00,10figures
00,02soo much time is spent on 'making games more profitable' (project $10, on disk dlc, normal dlc, blah)
00,02when the actual problem is SELLING games
^
Yeah
I'm back.
00,02CriticKitten, D:
Valve is usually pretty cheap
but cheaper games, cheaper production value
05Kandarihu: price of a mile :)
then again, most modern games don't look very fun or good
valve is pretty much win
05this one
00,02CriticKitten, issue is they price things at $90 and still need to ship 5 million copies to make money
00,02and now i must go
*genre)
It is possible, but dicking around with engine makes it more expensive than it perhaps have any business being
But like most products, I don't know how much a dev company has to say about pricing compared to the publisher
00,02CriticKitten, it does a bit
I don't like most indie games, but some indie games are good, some AAA companies mimic indie games, creating worse games than they used to-
but some being 70$, that's rediculous
it's like the corn
Price Lower= More buyers!
yeah
Price
derp
harvest more= less money harvest less more money
The explosion of the tablet and iOS market is another example.
Have you SEEN some of the games on those things?
i remember when people hated gamers...those same people now play skyrim
AWw
It can't play Limbo D:
!
I can't play TF2
And it's a sidescroller!!!!
I had a P4 3.2 ghz 2gb ram computer, and I could play metro2033 and GTA4, wtf guys?
!
of*
Oh wow yeah thats low
Yeah....
I recently upgraded to 16gb ram and 3.44 ghz I7
My netbook has 0.99G of RAM
dat change in music
:3
why would you need 16Gb of ram
music
okay
but still 16 seem a bit much
>.<
!
KILL THE SCOOTABABY
Yeah, that's not a typo.
Six dollars.
Six dollars.... Dats cheap
Did you know: MP3 creatores Fraunhofer Society made 150 million dollars on licenses in 2009 (might need to doublecheck on wiki)
and we as users never pay for MP3 license
well- kinda not
ill be right back
Oh :p
So....yeah. This is kind of an exciting time actually. The lines between indie and AAA are really blurring now. We may eventually reach a point where there isn't a line or at least not one of significant measure.
FoNV Music Ftw
too many people on too few projects = inflated prices and stupid decisions
and Fo3 music
wait
never mind
yeah FNV
nno?
FoNV> Skyrim
I don't want to break down that into why
(\
still like skyrim though
meh
BUt yeah here's another industry thing, animation industry
750 000 dollars per simpsons episode, how much of that is actors, and how much is production company?
If you'd asked me and given me no hint, I would estimated its costs at less than half that.
Honestly.
Because it just does not show.
Morrowind is my favourite
I just played MOrrowind this year, loving it
It's probably because Skyrim is one of the only AAA RPGs out there.
it has it's issues too, but I like it
Try to name the last AAA RPG before Skyrim.
See if you can.
It was The Witcher 2.
Now the real challenge, try to remember the one before that.
I didn't like witcher-
05fallout ftw
Two. Total.
I just didn't enjoy it, it's not bad though
That's just unfair. :P
Hehe
05id rather play F:NV than skyrim
^
WTF IS THAT?!?!
a tank I presume
oh
The genre's not quite rolled over and died, but it's close enough. Most of the RPG makers have rolled over into the MMO genre. >_>
jinjle janle
cause i can KILLE VERYONE
HAHAHAHAHAH
Hehehe
F1 is <3
Quest givers
come to think of it, I don't think I've played a WRPG yet
DED
See? They just don't show up like they used to.
PEOPLE DED
F1 and F2 are WAY darker than Fo3, FNV is also darker, but a bit less focused
sorry
Fractions.... PFFFFT
They're actually a lot harder to find now because RPG as a genre has sorta mixed itself into every other genre.
Fo3 had some issues, like weak drugs, no real penalty for addiction, not enough junkies, no negative effects from abusing JET- cheap items and "Forest = legend" and 3DOG--
But very few "pure" RPGs
I know that JRPGs kinda flocked from consoles to handhelds
yeah-
/me waits for it
but really RPG is a strange term
05then sides with the fiends
05GOOD JOB THERE!
I mean, in F1 I was hated in Junktown, and loved everywhere else, cause I fucked up bad
without cheats?
D:
if you have to have cheats or mods...it doesnt count
No I nevr killed kids in F2, but I could
here you are in a supposedly realistic world
Why cant i put a .44 magnum through a kids skull?
Hehehe
But yeah, the option is enough
Hello everypony.
00,10cause the kinds can still call the guards
Hehe
ALL THE AMMO
:3
KILL ALL THE QUEST GIVERs
i hate the mutants >_>
dat close call
^
You guys don't get it?
i made a role and played it
Yeah, they're evil in many situations
Hehe
I never really killed innocent in F2, but sometimes you play and--they steal from you or something, and you just snap
I got negative Karma for killing the ghouls that tried to kill people in pentenny poteorwe
and the evil spam
penptne..spelling
05never liekd the fatboy
once I murdered an entire village
05the concept of miniature nukes
05never liked it
same
I like my rifles
There is no such thing as a "mini" Nuke
FINALLY IT"S STREAMING AGAIN
Is tf2 free to play just a demo?
Yeah
yeah-
Of course in NV too it is kinda fruitless to abandon house and join Ceasar, but you CAN
hehe
If I decide I'm going to enact a policy of killing everyone in Skyrim, I should be allowed to, damnit. :p
youre doomed
victory, then squish
They killed me, while they were immortal
FATALITY

I really want to be able to KILL people if I decide they need to die, kplzthx

back then i didnt know bstate well enough i guess
ADHD is measurable though, but not everyone reacts the same as its an umbrella term
You hang around the IRC long enough and all the chats tend to flow together.

BREAKING NEWS! The biggest news we've ever had about the series, why we haven't gotten much info on season 3, and why there's only 13 episodes: http://derpy.me/rSOUb
it doesn't matter about character depth and all that shit
it's about the joke going too far like it did with ponies
lol
and if this barbros thing lasts too long there's going to be terror abounding
/me is drinking Beer
Idk, no need to argue I guess. I'm just more optimistic, you're not. That's okay ;D
well the flames may rise again

00,10we finished the match
00,10the mann up items did work
00,10the squad item worked
00,02yeah, not worth the money
00,10but we did not get charged them
The PS version got a way lower score too

phases servers are awesome
00,10and oddly enough we get "engien block" acheavment
X3
I don't need to spend to name tag
I have 4 sitting in my backpack
13i'm betting that's because the waves we won we never let them get that far
13when they did get that far, they always capped
That's like...almost a dollar.
11,02DUN DUN DUN DUN DUUUUUUN
Totally screwed
13sure it was hard but
13meh
13it was more luck
11,01So, that means their mountain is as "Explosive" as Yellowstone.
13so long as the wrong people didn't die at the wrong time, we handled it easy
11,01Which could cause global catastrophe.
