Oh.. Now I want to get that shown here
SpadeMagnes[R]: I love NicoCW's music. Nice choice of guitar.
I wonder if it is an A movie
I like that movie
I'm still in shelter island.
oh yea defiunate A, had budget of 16 mill, and made 235 grand
daaaaamn i want the infinity enchantment for my bow
anyone ever seen Space Sheriff Gavan? the new movie coming out looks EPIC http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sGOSUMqvg8
Probably one of the greatest revision of one of the greatest zones in Sonic history. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NN9R7pZAons&feature=channel&list=UL
er... I mean 235 million
00,10sounds like a flop to me Dken2021

00,10the page wont work unless we have an actave survay up

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvERHiTfx9w&list=PL55BC4FB9EA2BE577&index=24&feature=plpp_video This shall forever be Robotnik's theme
Michael: Green Hill Zone is overrated IMO. It's not that I hate it or anything, it's just that it gets too much hype.
And this Newsletter, we can use this to raffle a movie?
mmhmm
AJIsAwesome: yeah, but is just classic
Is it bad that I like this theme of Eggman the best? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SITtJDz5X0&feature=related
That one's good too
Wait! I found a theme that tops all of these! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO_z2nO3ByM&list=PL97014DD4B55FFBC5&index=33&feature=plpp_video
AJIsAwesome: Hah! Excellent!
I always managed just fine with a hole in the ground...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j763zxQfrfc <3 this music too
I think you guys might be overthinking this.
Green Hill Zone is overated.
00,03I don't >: (
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycSJZS5VJIo&feature=BFa&list=PL55BC4FB9EA2BE577 I love the Project Chaos remix of the Final boss from Sonic 3 and K
_
I'm probably the only one who didn't have trouble in Labyrinth Zone...:D
so much sonic music
gotta have somewhere to hold your stuff :P
Obsidian: bring all the sonic music!
Labyrinth wasnt that hard
So I heard something about Sonic boss music, and of course the first theme to pop in my head was http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIYnkOF7V7E
good lord
It's disappointing that the Sonic fanon has gone so far downhill, but at least the games and music are still fantastic.
Hello, hobbit friend, explain to these good folks the merits of a hole in the ground.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYZFwPRlQqc&feature=BFa&list=PL55BC4FB9EA2BE577 Go Big Arm music!
so true AJIsAwesome
Reikim: Favorite monster next to Perfect Chaos.
I haven't seen or heard Sonic (other than comments) since the mid 90s
Man, the biolizard. I didn't even mind fighting it seventeen times, because the music was that good.
I fucking love Live and Learn
What U Need
has anyone heard the Metal Hero series from Japan? like Gavan,Shaider,Sharivar,ect.?
Reikim: To be honest, my brother and I were stuck on Biolizard for weeks. Until we realized we had to maneuver towards the brain in the last segment of the fight.:D
The Blaze version of What U need is amazing
lol
And best stage theme: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6NaZrPQGfY
We wasted over 100+ lives trying to kill this guy.:D
ah I remember first fighting the biolizard, took me awhile when he was near dead
The last bit is fine if you circle around with the orbs. To be honest, I had more trouble with the final boss.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gPBmDptqlQ&feature=BFa&list=PL55BC4FB9EA2BE577 Best Final boss music EVER
Dunno, I liked SUpporting Me better.
BANANA
Sonic 3 Final Boss or S & K Final Boss
One thing remains consitant through out the sonic series
But City Escape remains one of the best first stage themes I've ever heard.
I like Sonic Colors's final boss music more, sorry.:$
No matter the game the music is awesome
Reikim: Oh, most definitely.
...
SpadeMagnes[R] true dat, even for sonic 096
*06
SpadeMagnes[R]: You're right about that.
Sonic Generations last boss I hate so much. Time Eater is worst boss.
The final boss for Generations should have had a bit from every final boss in sonic history
Yo.
MASF123: IKR? Strategy is Boost to Win. What kind of strategy is that?
Well the major cannoical ones
allo DemoPegono
DemoPegono: Hello!
Sonic Colours...the only problem I had was how it repeated boss fights only harder, instead of making you fight new bosses.
WOOH!
Hello DemoPegono

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1roK9-ujaN8&feature=BFa&list=PL55BC4FB9EA2BE577 I love Open Your heart so much including this mash up

Ryunosuke: I'm not a hardcore Sonic fan, so I don't mind.:)
okay... entering conversation
Better cure that condition real quick, or you'll get kicked for spam.
Just ask otakon.
Lol.
wat
huh?
..... okay.
oh
kickspam
Nothign otakon, just using you as an example to deter shenanigans.
kicks if you enter 6 messages in 10 seconds
Reikim: thanks -____-
I am a fan of the firs 3 game (I consider S&K an expansion)
Ryunosuke: Same here.
I say that pretty much anything after that... SUUUUUUUUCK
so... what's happining?
Hey, every god needs to smite a couple idiots now and then so that people don't start doubting his existence.
Just got bored, so I used le Royal Canterlot voice.
You just happen to be convenient, otakon.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th0EcC-5CA4&feature=BFa&list=PL0F49B3DB40DC9397 And for no reason I shall post the final boss music to Megaman Zero 4
Let's not try to go overboard on the Sonic debate, though.
I like toast!!
Asdfjkl;
SpadeMagnes[R]: ugh, why not Megaman 2 Wily Stage 2?
Okay, show of hands, has anyone (legitimately) beaten the first Zero game?
or Megaman X Opening Highway
I have
otakon: That theme is HIGHLY overrated.
otakon I think we know why no wily stage 1
or Storm Eagle
I have1
SpadeMagnes[R]: The final boss is an asshole.
STORM EAGLE!
Its storm eagle!
Storm Eagle is great.
Reikim: IKR?
Reikim: Took me forever to kill him.
I had to quite literally grind for crystals until I maxed all my elves JUST to beat that bastard.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sayGb0MMS_k
/me ragesw
eh, storm eagle isn't that hard compared to Toad man
LISTEN TO IT AND WEEP WITH JOY
not difficulty
Reikim: Wow.:O
AWESOMENESS
If you die to toad man you fail at life
Lol Toadman is easiest boss.
But
CAN YOU BEAT AIRMAN!?
Pff yes
goddammit Wrek|BUCK bot
Can you ever PERFECT Toad Man's Stage?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zmvm8zW0toE&feature=BFa&list=PL0F49B3DB40DC9397
otakon: Of course.
Can you beat Megaman 1? No? Didn't think so.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ja5QUTlgZ3Y&feature=relmfu
I've tried
I've REALLY tried
can't beat it
I've beaten 6
8
Oh otakon
X, X4 and Command Mission
I've beaten 1-8
dont you ever learn
GODDAMMIT Wrek|BUCK BOT!
lol
/me smacks Chrysalis with a halibut"
I've beaten X1-8 and command mission
otakon: You can't beat Megaman X? Have you tried the Hadouken strategy?
Need to go for the moment. Later everpony.
I HAVE BEATEN X!
Obsidian: Bye1
seeya Obsidian
I beat Megaman X, 2, 3, 5 but not Megaman 1-10 :/
bye Obsidian
lol otakon Its okay. I pretty much have only beaten x =P
and the Hadouken strategy doesn't work for me since I suck at the down, down-forward, forward motion
I've beaten 1-5, 6 I just find boring to play,m still on last boss of 7
I love the remix of the megaman 4 boss music http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Oz-QULJp4&feature=BFa&list=PL0F49B3DB40DC9397
But really, none of you - NONE OF YOU - are allowed to complain until you can best this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rKhIo1-F6A
my problem with the sonic series, is that they tried to be mario and it failed... hard. Every Sonic game after sonic 3 was essentially, a rail shooter. Super mario 64, was NOT a rail shooter, Super Mario Sunshine was NOT a rail shooter, Super mario galaxies 1&2 was NOT a rail shooter.
otakon: So what's the problem, otakon?
And now for something completely different - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRtzHxE17NE&feature=plcp
bullet hells DO NOT COUNT
AJIsAwesome: there is none
Ryunosuke: You have a point.
hi
THEY DO SO
Sonic runs in Mario's footsteps that's why.
ah, nice pic there kirz
otakon: What can't you beat, though?
otakon couldn't beat Mountain of Faith on Easy Modo.
kirz|art: hai, and nice bread :p
shut up
But kirz, where's the bread raptor?
wat?
ello DaringDerpy
dat stream
the bread raptor is hiding :P
kirz|art: Ooh! Can I have some?
finally finished her birthday present eh kirz|art
kirz|art thats awesom!
O_o
hai DaringDerpy
otakon couldn't beat Imperishable Night on Easy Modo with three continues.
Fluttershy <3
damn medic!
medic- cave johnson
DO NOT MAKE FLUTTERSHY CRY OR I KILL MEDIC
Medic
Reikim: it's a BULLET HELL I couldn't even see the character
u made fluttershy CRY, u must die
The hell?
LOL!
medic will die a painfull death
Also kirz, I think the perspective on the left wall and floor line is a bit off...potentially.
Dat EthioMod.
Who da streamer? :3
I love Micheal Rosen poops....:D
the hell?
awkward
otakon: NO. EXCUSES.

SpadeMagnes[R]: I was talking about when Heavy was skipping along...
SpadeMagnes[R]: GOD couldn't make sense of Rubberfruits videos
We watching any movies tonight or is it just a lets f*** around night?
i knew it was something metroid lol
Chrysalis: I'm not spamming

Coney Island.... :(
how much your getting spam kicked
At that height

SpadeMagnes[R]: what's sense? Just enjoy the madness!

A survival mode would be nice.
Well thanks to a few bronystaters last night I found the perfect combination of classes/weapons to win at MvM
Considering I can see the sky
Moar rubberfruit!
Rubberfruit makes best videos
Sumica: well dont trade for them, they want Hats/Misc items for them :/
Instead of having to defend the base.
The vanishing point is supposed to be on the horizon line.
Willy!
05but yeah anyone that met me at BUCK, it was awesoem metting thy
seems legit
Yay, Rubberfruit!
Chrysalis: how do you get mann up tickets?

Hello Applejack
bad dragon huh
otakon: a furry porn site...
seems so
00,10starts like it though
last I saw was Shizuka saying magic
Sumica I like that one
InB4 the Season 3 finale is done entirely in Source Film Maker
Anyway, kirz, moral of the story is the the vanishing point should be smack dab in the middle of the canvas.
otakon: some of my best friends are furries, I've seen many things
Chrysalis: IT'S SO FLUFFY!
Chrysalis: that person behind her does not look happy
Damn furries
pf, its just a furry site? nothing beats 4chan stuff
anker
wanker
looks like Shy put Spy into Cardiac *puts on shades* DAWresst. YEEEAAAHHH :D
Chrysalis, Fluttershy is suddenly the Witch
Although feel free to disregard me; I'm not exactly the most qualified artist.

Kudos for ever actually trying.

KILL YOURSELF YOU POOR BASTARDS
Play us some Kitty0706 next
MASF123: agreed
13you can have other vanishing points though
I learned the theory, did some sketches, and then kind of just...stopped.
MASF123: Saying that is like Bronies are pedophiliac freaks. It's not true, so leave them alone. They're who they are.
Yeah
There's one, two, and three point, generally.
Any more and it's too complicated.
you can, but they still have to follow the horizon most of the time
13like ten years ago in my last art class i tended to make the main point more to the left of canvas
well I don't give a damn what people like
00,10and that's the tomslavh
They always do
hell yeah AJIsAwesome /)
13gave more depth
Sketch_Toku_Brony: (\
The only time, though, that the point isn't on the horizon, is in three-point.
thanks Ninjazz|Blood :'(
Twily!
Then you get one to the bottom to simulate depth.
lol
Or top, either way.
dat twilight
We're not pedos, AJIsAwesome
I NEVER TIRE OF THE SQUEES

It is a major pain in the flank, however.

Besides, we're bronies. We need to accept each other for who we are.
Sumica not always
sometimes its the original
d' aww
PONES
00,10no I get that but it's like always that one
MASF123: freaks are only people who dont match stereotypes formed in society. we're also freaks
The only furr I'm ok with are brony furries
dat derpy
I'm okay with everyone who don't kill people
:o
MASF123: All furries are not bad. So let's stop talking about it.
AJIsAwesome: true but all I ask is don't flail it about
im ok with every furry... i dont judge people for their choices

I bought W7 for DX11
ok so UnfoundBug, Wrek, Buytoast, who else cant make out names
KEEEEL EEET
For some reason, MSSE never let go of 1/3 of my CPU when it finished it's virus scan. So I really should restart my computer
it was..cheap ish anyway
Cmon you damn server load! :[
why are you using the bazaar Bargain?!!!
KILL NEWBORN CUTIES SCOOTALOO
/me likes Vista and hopes people wont start crashing in o him
on
I would like to play tf2 but my laptop is out of commission
It's fine Trix, we'll try the other server
PaladinDrakkenwolf because Wrek pulls of loads of headshots.
/me 11,01turns computer back off :<
DashWithRainbows: I hope he's that good
wow thats a crowded game
He is.
brb
Imagine an invasion of robot newborn cuties Scootaloo...
Ponies47: try puting it below 50.000000
00,10damn I was slow, did't realise they started
Get a game of our own started.
i'd love to play too buy yall got full quick
Man, MvM totally overshadowed Portal 2's PTI Co Op
DashWithRainbows: normally with that many bots in a row I'd unload with the Machina
hi guys
There's a new portal 2 thing?
11,01XP was solid.
hello every one
whose streaming
Kandarihu: What about Portal 2?
11,01I hope W8 fails.
?*
wrek is
You can do Co op maps in the Perpetual Testing Initiative now.
PaladinDrakkenwolf Yes, the machina would be more useful, too bad I have really yet to see its devastation first hand.
W8?
well Sumica Nittany_Discord theres always the other servers, wont be on stream but....
I hope W8 is JUST for tablets, and that it STAYS that way
/me laughs at Wrek's accuracy
Spectrum_Rush|Sad: Okie doki loki. I still have the screen that says Preparing to launch Team Fortress 2" it takes FOREVER :|
00,10they are empty but yeah
If not, it will fail like ME
W8 is just too ment for tablets
Vivx:nahhh its for both pc and tablets you failed
Sucks for every other platform
that's what I thought
I'm currently joining Phase's other server. Well, one of them.
11,01Chrysalis wanted to do a Mann Up match.
I'll hop on that train.
The thing with W8 is that it's like a mobile O/S, it would be horrible to have that on PC, like installing those mobile ubuntus
00,02just think, if ea released this, it would be an entirely new game sold at $60 and they wouldnt be making soo much money off of mann up tickets
hiding?
Ponies47: well when ya get to it just change the number before the .
00,10I am cool with some mann up
My team fortress two just updated
woot woot
Vivx:ITS ALREADY ON PC ITS FOR BOTH TABLETS AND PCS
Wow, I guess we're all worried about Windows 8? I agree with everyone's dislike of it on PCs
mann up tickets? what are those?
Spectrum_Rush|Sad: Which it what I'm gonna do
11,01Phase4: EA would charge for Mann Up mode.
00,02or that
/me is just fine for Windows 7
EW would want to be your ISP
EA*
11,01And charge $20 for this or like you said, make it a $60 game.
...
EA would also make all the weapons purchase-only.
That would be cool if mann vs. machine came out for xbox Dlc
back
i would so bye it
WHAT ARE MANN UP TICKETS?
Kandarihu: I'm not really worried, but I really hope it does well on mobile things, and tablets, and stays away from--PC's, W7 is working just fine there
00,02cow334, valve has talked about the problems on xbox
i'm already in the other server :p
11,01TF2 Premium anypony?
The computer I'm using was made in 2002 and upgraded to Windows 7. WORST IDEA EVER :|
Pft, what are you talking about?
00,02microsoft litteraly wont let them
/me laughs because of a funny coincidence with his last name
My TF2's just booting up
EA would make it a free to play game....and then charge you money to do EVERYTHING.
sagas: Tickets to play a harder version of the Mann vs Machine co-op mode from TF2
Talk of some Mann Up in manechat
A'right me fillies, gotta sleep now. See you tomorrow for more BUCK fanboying!
Phase4: D: wy wont xbox alow it
Vivix, according to Microsoft, we're all going to be moving off PCs, and we'll all be using tablets in the future.
11,01Phase4: Even if Valve made it paid DLC?
Alister: Thanks
00,02cow334, not a clue, you'd have to look it up
11,01cow334: Microsoft are control freaks.
sagas: Anytime
/me is still angry at EA, yes, thanks for asking. :D
Bye MaidSurge
00,02Nittany_Discord, i think thats the issue, valve dont wan to release it paid
Kandarihu: yeaah- I don't think that's gonna happen, but I hope their tablets do well
I DONT HAVE A TABLET D:
00,02want'
/me enjoys EA's console games
I DONT WANT THAT TO HAPPEN
Oh? What are we angry about this time, CriticKitten? Because EA's got a long list to choose from.
I would never want to do my job or hobby on a tablet, too weak, too small, too portable
11,01Phase4: I know, and Microsoft forces almost all DLC to be paid.
Phase4: Okay then Nittany_Discord microsft should alow it wouldnt hurt nothing
00,02cow334, they really should
PCS ROCK
11,01cow334: They're too greedy and too strict with the 360.
Reikim: They ruined Command and Conquer. ;_;
EXEPT THEY LAG
00,02i'm sure there are many people who want tf2 on their xbox
What did they do, CriticKitten?
CnC used to be great ;__;
00,02and the fanbase of tf2 is MASSIVE
Phase4: :D it already is
Phase4: I don't. I don't even have Xbox
Phase4: Its just abandoned and empty
00,02sagas, its the same as when it was released
I know otakon would loooove TF2 on Xbox because he is a fool and uses controller.
00,02sagas, that
Phase4: I would be awesome Nittany_Discord it would boost up there money if they alowed it cause I'm pretty sure that would do something for them if they alowed it
/me Flips a tbale "CAN THIS COMPUTER BE ANY SLOWER!?" :[
Reikim: C&C Generals 2 is now a F2P MMO which has yet to announce its monetization plans, but given that it's EA they have no doubt already screwed the pooch.
it would be awesome
11,01If M$ can't make a buck from it (or make a buck twice over), they don't want it to happen on their console.
*table
CriticKitten: ...Goddamit.
I have a friend at church who does all his gaming on his 360 and plays Portal 2 and Skyrim. He wishes he could have Skyrim on PC just for the mods.
00,02Ponies47, dont say that, microsoft might hear you
00,10Chrysalis did you want to try mann up?
ah shizu as the Pyro :3
00,02Ponies47, they've already made it slow enough
Phase4: O.O
Microsoft are greddy
Reikim: Oh, and they want to do this to EVERY C&C title. They want to make a C&C Red Alert and a C&C Tiberium using the F2P model.
Nittany_Discord: Ide be willing to pay for an updated TF2
Sumica im in this game atm
00,10ah ok
Ponies47s computer then destroys itself with a fjnal message of "umad trolol"
I like Microsoft, but they're best as a corporation, not as a distributor or game company, they should leave xbox rules to a marketing company or something
Nittany_Discord, thats why CCP decided to go with the PS3 for Dust514, because of updates and expansion costs that MS would have incured
yea i am not doing mann up mode like...ever, cause i dont want to pay
Phase4: Ok then
11,01But Valve doesn't want fans to pay for this.
PillowPoni: O.O
CriticKitten: I just find the idea of a F2P EA title hilarious. You'd be paying out your nose for EVERYTHING.
11,01M$ does.
Reikim: And that's why my blood boils with rage and my spirit burns with righteous fury at them.
00,02Vivix, they used to be a good company, now its full of morons
It says I'm in game. I'm not! The game hasen't even booted up yet
I haven't payd attention to the last few years- but that may be the case eyah-
people didnt like it, saying the 360 was better, etc. but it came down to the business models of CCP vs Sony/MS
Nittany_Discord: I thought they just wanted the most people to enjoy it as possible
00,02windows 8 will fail hard, tbh microsoft will pull through but it will hurt really bad
I really hope they don't drop support for W7 with W8 release, and--just stay true to waht they used to be
yeah-
00,02make vista look like a success
You know what else suck I think from what I'm hearing o play online on skate 4 you need a pass code to get on it ... that kinda sucks i hate those things cause if you dont have one you need to pay another 800 microsoft points to play online FOR SOMETHING YOU ALREADY BOUGHT
... ._. i dont get it
Nittany_Discord: and making it buyable on live for cheap would do that
Reikim: Well, look at SWTOR. That's what they consider "free to play".
11,01cow334: Online pass?
/me laughs
im eating pizza right now :3
Whos playing?
wrek
I kinda hope W8 is marketed as a tablet thing, and that they really don't think they can stop producing things for--work computers and such, that would just- hurt the company
cool
SirGanjalf: [SWAG]Haku Wrekky
Reikim: So guess we get to enjoy a pay-to-win F2P C&C. Aren't you so excited? *eyetwitch*
Nittany_Discord: yeah the online passes where you put it in to play online they did it for deadspace 2
11,01Those are free to new game users. It's just EA punishing the consumer for Gamestop being greedy.
/me Taps his hoof waiting for TF2 to boot up
well Dust514 is going to be Free to play, rather its going to be ... microtransactioned
Phase4: I liked Vista and still use it....
no more movie trilogies?
11,01EA does it to every game with MP now.
00,02sagas, :<
just wondering
SirGanjalf: Sorry.:$
00,02its EA thinking used games are evil
I have my laptop so I can play team fortress easyily now
I bought W7 so I would hate for them to DROP it
woot woot ^^
/me pats CriticKitten consolingly; "If we're lucky perhaps they'll screw up so bad they'll be forced to sell the rights to someone else to make a profit. Hopefully."
[SWAG]Haku: Wrek is.
11,01And Sony, THQ (Who invented online passes), and Ubisoft also punish consumers for used game sales.
00,02they cant shift new copies, so they blame the used copies
Once the game boots up it will take about anthor 5 minutes just to load the main menu
inb4 otakon rages :P
^
11,01Publishers have always hated the used game market.
00,02all my terminals broke
00,02all of them
of course
Reikim: Oh, did I mention they've also dragged out the corpse of Ultima and they're making a F2P out of that franchise too?
I sold my mw3 copy....I got so bored of it, it's the same every game every year like here is a example
00,02why are they broke
11,01It's just with Gamestop coming along that made them start punishing people for it.
i think EAS trying to improve the games but they arent doing a very good job
they should rather go after gamestop
CriticKitten: They're still beating that dead horse? That's just...wrong.
Twisted.
video or live?
On numerous levels.
00,10room for more in other server
/me wonders what we will acheive complaining like this....
If tablets are really going to replace PCs, then are we going to all rely on cloud computing for the stuff that requires a lot of processing power, like games and video editing?
11,01Let me in Sumica
Nittany_Discord: ponies
Kandarihu: that's what a lot of apple nerds think, but iamgine how horrible that would make many workplaces
Squallken:live
cool thnx
On mw3 they gave out a free map called terminal and that map was on mw2 you see when I played it look like mw2 so basiclly it showing you how much of the same game it's ... I sint bying nothing from then no more
Kandarihu: could we not just shrink thinks down to tablet someday? Quantum Computing someday?
11,01EA is too stuck punishing and milking their fanbase for me to care about them.
Kandarihu, RIAA/MPAA wants to shut down cloud computing because of "Piracy"
hey shibaru
Reikim: Best part though? The thing that really twists the knife wounds in hard? EA's name isn't the only one on both of those projects. Bioware's name is on both the F2P Ultima and the F2P C&C.
not to mention people who do not want to have internet
00,02Kandarihu, computing power in tablets is incredible
sagas I don't want my DAW to be a tablet, it would just be horrible
Sumica: u got room in a sever?
00,02nowhere near pc's but still a fair ammount
Vivix: They do not belong in the modern age
CriticKitten: Oh Bioware's fine. EA just has them by the balls and forces them to do stupid things. *coughME3DLCcough*
Some thigns just aren't made for Tablets
11,01CriticKitten: Bioware is EA's puppet developer now.
Reikim: So it's looking like EA has turned Bioware into their F2P cash cow.
ANYPONY WACHT ADVENTURE TIME
DAWS are the modern age
Vivix: DAW?
00,02in time you will have graphics on a tablet competitive with todays pc's
00,10some room yes
Digital audio workstation, music studios
Vivix, I can honestly imagine a corporate computing cloud restricting tasks to only things that are good for productivity. That would be a good thing.
wow thɐt wɐs odd
so fkdusidjflifns
TheKoreanBrony1354: I FREAKIN HATE THAT SHOW! :[
Vivix: Ah
Sumica: could i join ya?
00,10I think Nitt is filling last spot
TheKoreanBrony1354: I do. It's a very critically acclaimed show.
awww
Nitt's taking last spot, yeah
Kandarihu: programing would always be better on a stationary or laptop, with internal cloud or something, never conneted to internet
ANY OTHER PONY WACTH ADVENTURE TIME
Game companies should never hook their computers to the internet
ɐɐɐ
11,01I really, really hate the corporate attitude in gaming. It's ruined the art.
00,02Kandarihu, people have done studies on that, aparently people get bored and become less productive (cant cite refferences unfortunately, it was a while ago when i read it )
Sumica: oh ok then, its cool
11,01And created the worst business practices of the 21st century.
00,10are you joining nitt or are you on your games suck thing?
wy are companys getting so greedy now and days
...
00,02Sumica, why not both?
Nittany_Discord its evil like all capitalism
TheKoreanBrony1354: You already asked that. You might get kicked for spam.
11,01I'm coming.
When I say companie and studios should not have internet, it's not just lazy workers, but hackers, viruses, work leaks and loosing code, and such
Reikim: So yeah. I'm just fuming with anger at it. They've destroyed so many franchises and it's just never enough. ;_;
Phase4:Nittany_Discord:well some games from EA are good
cow334: It's all about money, unfortunately.
11,01Games don't suck. I love games.
00,02sonicandmario85, i dont contest that
/me 00,02<3 mirrors edge
<3 communism
11,01If games sucked, I wouldn't play them.
^^
Phase4:i accidently pinged you sorry :P
Hai
11,01sonicandmario85: Even the good EA games are ruined by publisher bullshit.
I have a friend over
00,02but ea's buisness model is a failure to understand how things work
00,02sonicandmario85, np ^_^
AJIsAwesome: Money dosent mean anything cause at the end of the day what is money paper and metal simple meteriouls....wer is the luvs in the companys any more
We are simsing togewther
teh luv
Money is super important
Reikim: I'm hoping the rumors of EA being on the sales block are true. I wish we could coordinate the world's gamers and buy heavy stakes in the company.
00,02if there are used games, then there are people who dont want to play your game
Nittany_Discord:spore and pogo games are fun well atleast some of them are
Vivix: Im talking more on the consumer side. I can see why you would want a PC for your DAW. but there is no reason why not for personal use
consider how expensive it is to make and publish things, EA is doing it wrong, but if companies don't think about money we will only get crappy indie games
11,01CriticKitten: Good luck. Can't even get gamers to boycott MW2.
00,02you lost sales because your product sucked
00,10are you joining or not nitt?
sagas of course, but tablets wont last forever- I think
11,01Sumica: Yes.
Nittany_Discord cus boycotting is bad
11,01I'm starting steam.
its like boy but cott
cow334: I sympathize with you. But money is a form of exchange/barter in this world, and most people can't get enough of it.
and its like pie
Hey, there are good Indie games. A lot of them are much more fun than mainstream titles.
especially with MS thinking it will replace computers? If they stop making professional os for businesses to use, it will--suck
Vivix: same was said about PCs
Vivix: It's not that expensive to make good products.
AJIsAwesome: Today generation is become greedy ._.
It's expensive to release them fully
Vivix: The problem isn't the expense, it's how the money is spent.
Indie is good- but a lot of it is hrr
Vivix: EA fails because it spends its money in shitty ways.
when microsoft makes tablets the new pcs everyone will probaly switch to mac or linux
consider valve, they need massive amounts of money to keep producing HL3
oh wow you really did use that shep as your icon sumi XD
Giant Soldiers next wave
Money is Stupid!!! we must burn it and start a revolution!
Developement costs are so big these days
00,02all microsoft needed to do to NOT get horribly critisized with windows 8 was to NOT remove the traditional start menu
CriticKitten: true, very true
Right now lets start a revolution
00,02they've done work to cause the problem
11,01[19:48:00]	CriticKitten	Vivix: EA fails because it spends its money in shitty ways. <- this.
Phase4: Is there a server that not is full so I can play on it cause i would realy liek to plaay mann vs machine
i wish i could play tf2 sadly i have no internets till i get a job
00,10yep
cow334: I know that feel. We can't even tell the difference between buying what we paid for and getting ripped off.
Vivix: Dead Space 3 needs to sell 5 million copies? Whose fault is that? It's sure as hell not ours. It's THEIRS for spending way too damn much on their game.
11,01It doesn't take 5 million $60 sales to make Dead Space 3 good.
00,02cow334, nyx.ariscop.net spitfire.ariscop.net or applebloom.ariscop.net
Sumica: also if ya lose anyone, i'm on standby to join
00,02not sure how many people are on them
AJIsAwesome: I feel you man ...today lifes suck wy cant peope be nice
CriticKitten: truue, true, but I mean other companies, they need to pay their bills, so we need to pay them, ea is abusing that and creaitng a bad name for the entire business
Phase4: thanks
Vivix: "Pay their bills"? Dude, do the math for a sec
11,01Dunno if EA lost money on ToR, but I won't be surprised if they did.
00,02cow334, password is ponies
deadspace
I'm not talking EA when money
00,02Nittany_Discord, EA lost money
00,10well you could probably observe too Spectrum_Rush|Sad
oh man that game was so good
thanks Phase4
11,01They spent way too much creating that game.
Vivix: 5 million copies of Dead Space 3 means that they claim they need to make $300 million dollars on the game in order for it to be financially successful.
00,02ToR is aparently freking massive
$300 million dollars, man.
CriticKitten: I'm not talking EA, as said, they creat a bad name by abusing that
but honestly i feel bad for EA
Remember how many employes do EA have?
cow334: Because people believe that the characteristics of ever-changing society makes them cool when it obviously doesn't.
NO GAME should need to make $300 million dollars to survive.
NONE.
11,01Dammit. TF2 is glitching again. Won't let me in.
x years pay, insurance, rent, computers, maintenance
Vivix: None of those things cost $300 million combined.
A game might suddenly cost 100 million dollars
Vivix: You vastly overestimate the costs.
One simpsons episode cost 750 000 dollars, what does a game cost?
Vivix: If the costs of making video games were so high, how are there indie developers at all?
11,01EA would save money by allowing 3rd-party servers.
They're doing it on spare time with tiny manpower, and cheap methods
Vivix: Because in your hypothetical world, they couldn't exist
11,01And not wasting it on their shitty online pass scheme.
00,02EA would charge you for a licence to run a server
11,01Don't have to pay for auth servers.
CriticKitten: It's not hypothetical, and I'm not talking EA
k i'll observe sumi
The scale between EA games and indie games is like the scale between Lord of the Rings and Clerks.
Team means lag is sweden o_O
Vivix: It's entirely hypothetical, because the reality is very different. The reality is that EA is just run by morons who don't know how to spend their money properly.
in*
how about i just set EA on fire?
hey cow334 think i could join ya?
Kandarihu: Torchlight 2?
CriticKitten: are you even listening? EA is abusing that to get more money than they need, I'm not talking abou them AT all
i played TOR it was different
Torchlight 2... is that an indie game with high production values?
Hj cratorkid
PillowPoni: nice skilz :D
pretty standard mmo but i liked how they had full voice acting and environmental damage
Kandarihu: It's an indie game which looks like a highly polished Diablo 2.
00,10you must have the slowist log in to steam in all of creation
Nittany_Discord: Too buggy to play, or should we keep waiting a bit more?
cratorkid I can see when you get on :)
how you doing cratorkid
sure NocturnalBlade
Kandarihu: You can bet it didn't cost them $300 million to make it either. :p
00,02Nittany_Discord, http://derpy.me/lO8M7 little bit more from the same guy, this ones about the art style
PillowPoni: must know all your sewcrets
00,02$200 Million spent on the game
11,01I think someone stole my spot/.
NocturnalBlade: add me on steam my name is cow224
if Nittany_Discord cant play, i'm on standby
hi alexxm ,im doing fine, how are you
cow334: cool, it'll be a little bit and i shall add you
11,01Says 6/32 on both server.
cratorkid I have mIRC. ;)
Frankly, I think some games are getting the indie label without really deserving it. I don't know Torchlight, but Bastion comes to mind.
11,01*servers
i'm good cratorkid
PillowPoni: ohh ok
NocturnalBlade: awesome
cow334: it'll also take a bit to join
Nittany_Discord Yeah, spectrum rush just joined the server.
Indie is basically a game without publisher, therefore Minecraft is not indie anymore, since they started a publishing company or osmethin
NocturnalBlade: it's okay i am fixing my settings right now woot woot
00,02well, theres a third server
oh crap Nittany_Discord that might be my fault, i'll disconect for ya
00,02not sure which two you guys are using
Vivix: The problem with your argument is that you're suggesting that maybe it's because of costs, but it's been proven that it's not. There are a LOT of developers out there who are not spending 9 digits on their games, EA is the ONLY ONE.
11,01I have Nyx an Applejack on favorites.
Nittany_Discord: Sorry, Spectrum_Rush seems to have slipped in.
And it's sure as hell not showing in game quality, that's for sure
Vivix, if lacking a publisher means indie, then Bastion is DEFINITELY not indie, thanks to WB Games.
if i have a good working computer and i put the settings to low would it make it even better cause with high setting it can still play good
!
so would that make it better\
Kandarihu: thats how it started at least ,yeaah-
00,02Nittany_Discord, applebloom' :P
Nittany_Discord: try join again
CriticKitten: I know, and EA is abusing more money than they would need, but take games like Half Life, they most definitely cost something around 100 000 000, purely based on the years pay of the workers and amount of time in dev and maintenance of office and rents
00,02Nittany_Discord, theres a spot on nyx
00,10again? he has not joined till just now
Uhhh.
An indie company would probably be in some guys flat, while they all have jobs, in their spare time
TF2?
lol
11,01I don't think anyone is happy to work at EA.
"that was easy?"
=D
I've only heard bad things abou their worker relations-
00,02applebloom seems empty
Phase4: can you give me the server name again
sorry
Nittany_Discord: maybe the senior staff
11,01Unless they're sadists, they'd probably like to be working elsewhere.
No shit @Pal
11,01cratorkid: Or that.
Vivix: That assumes the workers are being paid from start to finish. That is not actually how pay is set up in most cases.
00,02cow334, applebloom.ariscop.net , password is ponies
Phase4: thanks
11,01But everyone hates the senior staff.
CriticKitten: I'm just using a n unresearched assumption that certain amount of people get payed for their work
11,01Since they represent the company.
BLEH
Vivix: Otherwise any game which takes more than two years would never be released because costs would be much too high.
of course in valves case you have several games being worked on by several people of intermingling groups
Nittany_Discord: but all they really care about is money , if they cared about people hating them they would have changed their games
and im back
Dis song.
hi sagas
dat Rammstien
No, because they don't pay the cost at the end of game production, the cost of production is the money spent while making the game CriticKitten
ok now im observing sumi
Vivix: Pay is distributed differently in game development.
05this aint rammstein
Wrek: really? sounds like them
Nittany_Discord: I think Bronysith told us he had a friend whose dad quit EA to work for Valve. Apparently flipped them off on the way out.
11,01Yeah.
Reikim: Wow.
Vivix: Then lemme ask you something: how do they pay for the production costs of a game before it's released? ;)
Reikim: i wouldve
I think EA is pretty mean to their workers
Reikim: LIKE A BOSS
11,01Activision, too.
Technically, a game can be published by a small business and count as an indie game. It's made professionally, but the publisher just doesn't have the resources to press DVDs, so they rely on the internet for distribution. They don't have the resources to sell web ads, so they rely on social media, sympathetic news sources, and word-of mouth for promotionals.
11,01Especially back in 2009.
CriticKitten: the production cost = amount of money spent during production
not somethign you PAY anyone specific, just your budget for that game
11,01When Kotick "joked" about how he treated his developers.
that's why movies, games, tv shows are all estimated production costs
I haven't heard anything too bad from Lionhead Studios
"Joked"?
11,01"Taking the fun out of making games" and "keeping them in the deep depression."
:(
IMO, the line between indie and major publishers is how large the publisher is.
That's not good at all
Vivix: I'm aware of what the term means, I'm pointing out that you don't understand how the pay is divided.
Nittany_Discord: wy would he say that
11,01I boycotted Activision for years over that.
11,01Kotick is an asshole.
CriticKitten: how it's divided doesn't matter, I'm not calculating the cost, only hearing estimates
._. that is mean
even if he said it was a joke
hello everypony
WATS UP EVERYBODY!
Nittany_Discord leave EA alone and go to TF2 :p
Vivix: Actually yes it does matter, because you're arguing a case that isn't true.
Canadian_Brony: Hi!:)
11,01Trying to.
Bunny_Striker I just got here. Hi!
Bunny_Striker: Hi!:)
00,10FFS nitt while you rant you have 5 people waiting on you
Nittany_Discord boycotting is bad..
CriticKitten: This is my argument: games cost money to make, so we need to pay.
11,01Sumica: I keep trying to join.
Vivix: You're saying "they have to pay for people's work across the entire development time" which is *not* how development pay is distributed
I have no idea what you're arguing about
hello Bunny_Striker and Canadian_Brony
11,01When I did join, you had the game going.
MvM/
?
My team fortress is still loading
and one who keeps takeing your spot accidently Nittany_Discord
11,01Don't worry about me and just play.
No we didn't, we're waiting for you.
My bucking computer won't run TF2
CriticKitten: No, that's not really what I mean, but as I am an idiot with language that might be how I come across
piece of sh*t
The thing is, indie games aren't perfect either. Magicka is an excellent example. The game came out with horrible bugs which Arrowhead worked hard and fast to fix. Nowadays, the game is STILL glitchy, but not entirely horribly broken. But they don't want to work on bugfixing anymore. They just want to make more DLC.
Sumica: i'll join
Vivix: I have no idea.
Reikim: yes that is true
Kandarihu: yeees, its soo broken to me-
/me dusts Nittany_Discord and cleans him squeaky clean "calm down dude and enjoy your game"
Vivix: And here's my argument: we shouldn't have to pay for people's moronic development mistakes. If EA is shoveling out nine digits for their games then they are doing something very very wrong, because their quality is being matched by people spending MUCH LESS.
11,01Suffering from depression doesn't help.
CriticKitten: yes, I agree with you. When didn't I?
Cave Story is best indie game. Just saying~
did the grey man getted you?
Vivix: When you started making excuses for why it costs that much. :p
Reikim what about MineCraft?
I made excuses for why other companies NEED us to pay
Same here, Nittany_Discord.:(
Cave story beats Minecraft~
>o>
^
/me hugs Nittany
/me hugs Nittany_Discord too
How do you become a mod?
Vivix: No, what companies need to do is spend their money wisely and make a good product. It's up to us if we pay for it or not.
To be honest, I wouldn't be surprised if EA's profits aren't trhough the roof
Reikim, Cave Story is the poster child of indie games. Made by a single visionary over the course of five years.
Vivix: They're not.
I'm in a lobby bymyself
/me also hugs AJIsAwesome
._.
Pinkielover123: Magic. It happens whenever they are looking for, which is not now.
/me Hugs nittany_Discord
Sumica: I see what you see O_O
Vivix: They're actually doing very very badly right now.
Kandarihu: And I love it with all my heart.
PillowPoni: Thanks.
OH.
Kandarihu: Pixel is my role model.
cratorkid: as it should be
AJIsAwesome you're welcome :)
hey cow334 i cant find you on steam
Sumi exactly :D
NocturnalBlade: Serch Cow224
i think it should be there
ooo 224
I'm not sure what I'm arguing atm, I just don't like people thinking they're entitled to free games, just because a company is big
Vivix: They've shelled out several titles that haven't fully recouped their costs, and investors have been pulling their cash from the company, causing a stock slide. They're worth less than half as much now as they were ~a year ago.
Vivix: I....don't think anyone said that.
CriticKitten: Ah- they really need to--rethink their management
there we go cow334
No I don't think any did, but I kinda twisted into that with a nonspecific rant
Which might have been seen as "defending EA"
hello cute anthros http://derpy.me/iyTrH
NocturnalBlade: woot woot ^^
i think theyre selling stock for 7 or 10 right now CriticKitten
Vivix: What I remember saying is that I'm not obligated to pay for their shitty mistakes. If they fuck up, they deserve to pay for it themselves. And hopefully eventually they'll learn how to spend their money properly and will produce a product worth buying. :P
EA is stupid.
11,01Thanks for the hugs.
oh yea, isn't EA up for sale now?
Supposedly.
/me puts Nittany_Discord in a maid corset and pulls the strings
I see no purpose in making the same game ever year, just making the graphics a smidge better
CriticKitten: Yes, but they will try to recopurate their loss in any way possible, including fucking up the market for other businesses, I mean EA's crap is turning people against hte industry, right? That's not good for valve, Zenimax, or any of those
cratorkid: Wow, that's even lower than before.
Vivix, I just did a find for pirat and piracy on the log. There's been virtually no talk of it in the past few hours, especially in regards to games.
/me 11,01is still sad
Vivix: No, all they're doing is turning people against THEM.
/me slaps Nittany_Discord
NocturnalBlade: i do warn you i'm new to this so i might not be te best on it
/me 11,01likes, but is still sad
Kandarihu: I know, I just kinda went to that spot in my money rant
/me huggles Nittany_Discord :D
Nittany_Discord: it all gonna be k promise
/me Gives Nittany_Discord a muffin.
cow334: its cool
/me ruffles Nittany_Discord's mane :3
Nittany_Discord: watch smile smile smile, is eriously cannot frown while watching that
NocturnalBlade: looks awesome
Bronysith : not too hard, you don't want to choke or suffocate him
CriticKitten: But it's splashing over, or am I totally wrong on that?
Vivix, I understand. I kinda go off into tangents sometimes too, I guess.
I'm horrible at it because I forget what's going on and just say things
11,01Bronysith: It's true.
couldn't you keybind a toggle Sumica ?
Vivix: The whole industry is suffering, but it's not specifically because of EA being a bunch of idiots. Rather it's because almost everyone is being a bunch of idiots.
BRB.
Bronysith: I frowned at smile smile smile ._.
Vivix: And it's to be expected when everyone recognizes that $60 and $10+ DLC is too much to spend on a game, but they keep making games at that price anyways.
CriticKitten: I don't know much about any of the other publishers, but that might be true. We can't really do anything about it other than spend our money wisely.
But they're loosing money because of it right?
wait some dlc is 20 bucks
NOPE.
THat's the best signal we can give, until something happens
Vivix: 'tis why I rarely spend my money on any games any more, except for indie titles.
CriticKitten: The only game I am willing to pay 60$ for is Assassin's Creed
thats kinda a lot
I'm not spending much money on games at all
Vivix: lately yes , people are starting to wise up
Why are we aguring about this?
Goodgood-
Well, lemme correct myself.
We're just talking, I think
I have spent $60 on one game.
But that game was Guild Wars 2. They earned it.
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m91kbtp1Yx1qzih6bo1_500.png
Wow, Wrek just reapawned and fired the winning rocket.
Pinkielover123 who the buck knows. Last time I was here, I left a conversation about oil
Major: Gouda to hear!
They actually produced a $60 product.
I think I want to buy --actually I'm only waiting for one game, HL3, and Black mesa source
Major didn't know there was a cheese gender
CriticKitten: Ubisoft is one developer that delivers
but that's mostly because I'm half out of gaming, and just waiting for thigns I recognize
We talk about the politics of the game industry a lot here.
Vivix: i havent boght a game since... skyrim
11/11/11
Oh yeah, Skyrim
the last 3(?) games i bought we're all from Atlus
NocturnalBlade: ia it still looading
the last game I bought was "Poker Night at the Inventory" IIRC
the last game I bought was metroid prime 3, in 2011
Biglaw: yes , not a single game for like , 7 months?
It's an issue that's often on Nittany_Discord's heart.
same XD
Skyrim is fun, though I don't actually have it
cratorkid: eeyup
nice shot
I'm beginning to understand the issue around it, but I tend to go off on "Businesses deserve money" tangents when it's brought up
The last game I bought was from Rock Star, Rock Band 2
<_<
00,02Nittany_Discord, http://derpy.me/ZpvTy
>_>
hi Phase4
last game i bought was minecraft for the xbox
Its 8:13pm, both of my laptops are out of commission, I don't feel lime watching the anymore until 10 tonight and I'm broke. Wat do?
00,02ohai
allo Phase4 :D
PillowPoni: Watch TV?
PillowPoni ponies
00,02PillowPoni, fix laptops with duct tape
ugh. i want a chocolate muffin
PillowPoni: take a walk, throw cans at passing cars
Im going to tart a match by myself on mann vs machine is it any hard?
PillowPoni: play video games?
i think i can do it by my self
00,02cow334, its different
00,02oh, on your own?
Thelonepony the only game I have is spyro
Spyyroooh
Phase4 depends on how it's broken. Not even ductape can repair a fried motherboard
00,02it wouldnt be Imposible to complete the game on your own
Frankly, I like the exploratory aspect of piracy. Download it if you're interested. If you like it, buy the official release. If you don't like it, don't.
I'm afraid of playing Spyro because of nostalgia
I laughed at the valve one
11,01Last $60 game I bought was Skyrim.
00,02cow334, but even on the easy modes it would be epic hard
11,01I really should play it more.
Kandarihu: That's the same positive effect piracy has on music, but soome people don't do that
Phase4: I can try to do it Woot woot ^^
Vivix I have a four year old niece, and she's sleeping.
Nittany_Discord: nah, play new vegas
00,02cow334, also not sure if it allows you tro
00,02to;
Kandarihu: And- since demos are rare now, why not, right?
If the official release is bogged down with DRM, enjoy your pirated copy.
PillowPoni: FUS RO DAH! *waaah*
/me slaps Biglaw
o.o
PillowPoni: Aah-well- you could get some paint and paint?
Canadian_Brony I don't have the hub
Hello all. :)
Phase4: hmm well lets find out woot woot How much you wanna bet i can beat the first one by myself
Phase4: i think the tank is impossible by yourself
/me gives Bronysith a chocolate muffin
lali-ho pony_607890
Biglaw: thank you
Kandarihu: I have payed for games, and used pirate because of DRM before- jeez--drm is just fuck
00,02LunarSS, probably right
Biglaw lolol don't have rimming of the sky
:p
here we gose it are tims tu dies robots from outer space
00,02fully upgraded heavy MAYBE
PillowPoni neither do I, but all the episodes are on Youtube
00,02i dont think it scales to number of players
i wannz sleep, but it's so interesting talking to you all :'(
I buy almost all my games used, except for one new game a year
And I also have another rule of thumb. Only buy a game on discount if you HAVEN'T been pirating it. Pay full price if you've made up your mind that it's worth the money.
with 3 people it was damn near impossible
For some reason I never buy used games- I don't really like used thigns unless they're over 20-30 yers old
Phase4: one laptop needs a new batter or charger.,neither of which I can afford. My other laptop needs a new hard drive
there's been a few DS games I pirate that I want to buy
Kandarihu: Ahh, that's actually a nice rule
And if this happens with games, DRM will be COMPLETELY obselete.
Phase4: what do you press to ready up?
that one problen bout observing Sumica , ya get kicked for inactivity
._. lol i fail
00,02PillowPoni, pull the hard drive from the one without a charger, problem solved :P
Music industry is benefiting from Spotify, Youtube allowing music, and piracy, and noDRM or crazy shit, gaming industry COULD as well- Demos, no DRM's, less online content
Vivix I love the trilogy but I need riptos rage and yotd again
00,10love that error of hl2 crashing
PillowPoni: Trilogy? Ah--Spyro?
/me glomps Sumica s frustration
Demos don't give a complete vision of how the game will pan out. It's like an interactive movie trailer.
Phase4: you where right i need at least more then one person to start the game ._.
00,02cow334, i think you need 3
11,01Phase4: Saw that before.
11,01The pic you linked.
ugh
Kandarihu: true, but it would allow people who get a glimpse if they want, the best demo I've tried waas HL1 demo, didn't have anything to do with Half LIfe at all, but was great- made me buy it
00,02Nittany_Discord, ah
Phase4: is there a lobby with people in it
that i can join
Well, this isn't usually my type of music, but I kinda like it 0.o
00,02cow334, you could try the autojoin thing but its usualy full
Phase4: yeah it was already full
Phase4 I would but I need a really smal screwdriver to take the casing off the hard drive and if I managed that, I would have to format the drive and install the drivers and all because one is an Acer and the other is a dell
heh val took your spot Sumica
Demos have less of a tendancy to lie than trailers do. But the danger is there nonetheless.
00,10figures
Vivix : yep the one made by Insomniac
Yeah, what was nice about Hl1 demo was that it was it's own mission, not related to the game
00,02soo much time is spent on 'making games more profitable' (project $10, on disk dlc, normal dlc, blah)
00,02when the actual problem is SELLING games
^
00,02not wringing more money out of those who are still buying
but you know, demo would be like a spotify, and piracy would be like youtube, it would probably increase sales or maintain sales
Yeah
00,02not to mention the cost of development these days, which is just stupid
Mom's liking Wrek's music. What was that last song?
Phase4: Now here's a radical notion and stop me if you've heard it before, but what about if they just....priced games cheaper? :o
I'm back.
00,02CriticKitten, D:
Valve is usually pretty cheap
WB AJIsAwesome
but cheaper games, cheaper production value
allo AJIsAwesome
05Kandarihu: price of a mile :)
CriticKitten: they wont do that
then again, most modern games don't look very fun or good
05wonder if whe lieks the one i queue now
valve is pretty much win
05this one
Canadian_Brony Dken2021 Thanks you guys.:)
00,02CriticKitten, issue is they price things at $90 and still need to ship 5 million copies to make money
Bronysith true that
00,02the numbers for dead space 3 are around somewhere
00,02and now i must go
I remember the days when my parents and I would go rent a movie and possibly a video game.
seeya Phase4
Phase4: your planet needs u?
Vivix: I again feel it necessary to point out that Torchlight 2 has production quality that is actually quite astonishing for a smaller developer (it's been compared to D2 and D3 in terms of quality since it's the same genre_, and the game is priced at $20.
take care Phase4
see ya later Phase4!
*genre)
bye Phase4
Canadian_Brony: I remember when you could rent video game consoles.
CriticKitten: I haven't seen that- but yeah, valve was also a ble to price games that low, episodic, but still-
Phase4: Which suggests that somebody misspent the money, don't it? :P
Bye Phase4
It is possible, but dicking around with engine makes it more expensive than it perhaps have any business being
bye bye Phase4
But like most products, I don't know how much a dev company has to say about pricing compared to the publisher
00,02CriticKitten, it does a bit
It's possible and honestly preferable. The only reason companies still get away with $60 games is because the indie market isn't as big as they are yet. But it's getting there.
I don't like most indie games, but some indie games are good, some AAA companies mimic indie games, creating worse games than they used to-
If games were 40$ new, I wouldn't mind
but some being 70$, that's rediculous
Biglaw: that would be fantastic if it cost that much
Thing is, if a company is doing bad, their games will be expensive, most of the time
it's like the corn
Price Lower= More buyers!
yeah
Price
derp
I wonder if Wrek has a Beggar's Bazzoka. Set it's clip to max and pair it with a Buff Banner to destroy anything instantly
I'm not at economical--business man, so I don't know how pricing works, but its not just one dude sitting there
indie market could make it, if some of the devs don't try an make a game that feels 8-bit and artsy, sure it's less lostly to use sprites, but I want to be able to play something, not feel
harvest more= less money harvest less more money
CriticKitten: True, indie is getting better and bigger, like a medium between truly indie and truly mass market
I remember when computer games came in an actual cardboard box, with a printed manual, for 20 bucks.
The explosion of the tablet and iOS market is another example.
Vivix: I prefer to buy games on Boxing day, I saw SR3 for 20$, though I didn't grab it, I regret it D:
Have you SEEN some of the games on those things?
if game wouldnt cost that much they would make a fortune think about it all of the cod peopel they already bought there games but if they made it even lower then they would by them even more not me do I dont bye games like that they dont do that probaly cause it will waste money or they aint that smart
i remember when i paid full price for a game and the game itself was complete
Biglaw: I bought it for 10bucks during steam sales- oh god- I was glad I bought it cheap cause I didn't like it at all
Sumica: whats down that hatch behinf you?
Vivix: I don't have it yet :p
i remember when people hated gamers...those same people now play skyrim
I would give it to you if I could but- steam
I just did not enjoy SR3, so yeah-
Vivix: my computer couldn't play it anyways :p
AWw
It can't play Limbo D:
!
I can't play TF2
And it's a sidescroller!!!!
any one want to play mann vs machine
I had a P4 3.2 ghz 2gb ram computer, and I could play metro2033 and GTA4, wtf guys?
Vivix: My desktop has 504MB or RAM
!
of*
Oh wow yeah thats low
Yeah....
I recently upgraded to 16gb ram and 3.44 ghz I7
My netbook has 0.99G of RAM
dat change in music
:3
i love games so much, it is my passion. along with reading and writing
So smooth
I used to have 4gb ram, and Cubase would crash on long songs
why would you need 16Gb of ram
music
okay
On more than one minute track the input would lag and ruin my take
but still 16 seem a bit much
>.<
so I upgraded to 16- cost about 120 bucks? 900kr
I mean, you wanna talk about the lines blurring? Let's talk about fricking Infinity Blade. iOS market game that has AMAZING production quality, costs....$6.
!
KILL THE SCOOTABABY
Yeah, hopefully it iwll make big companies realize htey need to change to survive
Yeah, that's not a typo.
Six dollars.
Six dollars.... Dats cheap
With production quality that makes it look like it's pretty close to a console game.
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m92vwohqDM1rxho9uo1_1280.png <-- Love <3
isnt that game just a tech demo
Valve and Bethesda make hteir own engines, so they need to pay for that aswell, and they pay fraunhofer and JPEG lib(? do they?) and all that
not to mention both pay Havok
Major nice pick of luna
The second game is apparently only $3 at the moment, too. So they're doing well enough that they can put their $6 game ON SALE.
Major: Wow.:O That's amazing.
Did you know: MP3 creatores Fraunhofer Society made 150 million dollars on licenses in 2009 (might need to doublecheck on wiki)
Major lovely
and we as users never pay for MP3 license
Bronysith whose tumblr is it
well- kinda not
Vivix: Pirates, pirates everywhere >_>
ill be right back
i love molestia
damn it i mean Major
Biglaw: nono, it's because- we don't have to pay mp3 license, since we aren't making things with MP3 code
Oh :p
JJ makes funny comics
So....yeah. This is kind of an exciting time actually. The lines between indie and AAA are really blurring now. We may eventually reach a point where there isn't a line or at least not one of significant measure.
whilst Valve would have to pay Fraunhofer for using mp3 system to create sounds in their engine
FoNV Music Ftw
And if they can do this while selling their games for less, it begs the immediate question of what the hell our current AAA devs are doing wrong.
love the FoNV music
too many people on too few projects = inflated prices and stupid decisions
and Fo3 music
thelonepony: nope
wait
never mind
thelonepony: golddinosaurs :3
yeah FNV
Vivix: one good game I enjoyed on the original xbox was Fable
NEW VEGAS> FO3
Biglaw: ooh yeah
Well, Vivix, here's another thing to make you think. Have you heard how much SWTOR cost to make?
Vivix: I got the expansion :3
Biglaw: that game was good, but waaaaay overphyped
nno?
Bronysith: It's still one of my most replayed games, replayed at least 7 times, always awesome
"Although BioWare has not disclosed development costs, industry leaders and financial analysts have estimated it to be between $150 million and $200 million. If accurate, this would make it the most expensive video game ever developed."
and skyrim had the same effect. except that skyrim is so fucking OVERATED
CriticKitten: wooo-
FoNV> Skyrim
I don't want to break down that into why
Metronome: /)
Fallout > all rpg's I've played
(\
still like skyrim though
meh
BUt yeah here's another industry thing, animation industry
Skyrim was a big disappointment for me :/
skyrim is just reallly overated and gets more love than it deserves
Makes your brain hurt though, don't it? Does SWTOR look like a nine-digit game, honestly?
750 000 dollars per simpsons episode, how much of that is actors, and how much is production company?
Bronysith: yes it does, I like it, but the animation is cheap- some models are horrible- bugs and the ai is kinda shoddy- it's not amazing, but it's fun
"Oh yes, i love the elder scrolls series, skyrim is my favorite....wahts morrowind?"
Fall out 3 has an interesting story but New Vegas...I find it boring :/
If you'd asked me and given me no hint, I would estimated its costs at less than half that.
Honestly.
I played Fallout 3, it's a good game, don't have it though
Because it just does not show.
Major, Bronysith: Thank you. I don't know why Skyrim gets such a high reputation than it already needs.
Major: new vegas is an overall better game
Morrowind is my favourite
I just played MOrrowind this year, loving it
It's probably because Skyrim is one of the only AAA RPGs out there.
Vivix what about the cost for guest stars?
it has it's issues too, but I like it
AJIsAwesome: its because skyrim is soooo fucking popular because IT IS EASY
but the fighting parts of the game is poopy
Ooh Dken2021 yeah, Guests and Music licenses, probably in the tens and tens of thousands
Bronysith: Nope. It's because think of how many AAA RPGs get released.
I wonder how much MLP costs, 40 000?
Bronysith: in what way? You hunt for a guy, let him live or die, and then you do whatever. Thats it, in FO3 it has a bit more story to it
Try to name the last AAA RPG before Skyrim.
CriticKitten: where was the love for morrowind or oblivion?
See if you can.
Do you remember what it was?
It was The Witcher 2.
i love morrowind
Major: there are over 90 endings to new vegas, even though 3 has a better story, new vegas is just the overall better game
Now the real challenge, try to remember the one before that.
Bronysith: oblivion was just as easy as skyrim...
Fallout NV is way closer to the originals, but I liked F3 story more, FNV mechanics and openness more. I hated optimus prime in F3 though
LunarSS: still more complex and deep than skyrim though
If you succeed, you've got me beat because even *I* don't remember the last big RPG before Witcher 2.
Bronysith: wow 90 endings that really makes it better than FO3 :/
I didn't like witcher-
Major: i said thats one reason, but can you mod weapons in FO3?
So think about that. That's only two big full-blown RPGs in recent memory.
my all time favourite rpg series ever is Fallout, including the originals
Major: ooh, how about alternate ammo?
05fallout ftw
Major: hardcore mode. do you get hardcore mode?
Two. Total.
Wrek: /)
how come Vivix whats so bad about witcher never played it
So with the movie trilogy feature over, I take it you guys are just going to spend your weeknights doing TF2 for the time being?
fallout 3 had the best choices that fallout new vegs
I just didn't enjoy it, it's not bad though
Bronysith: who needs that stuff when the game is challenging enough?
That's why Skyrim is getting praise. Look at what it has to compete with, guys. It's either Witcher 2 or Skyrim. That's not even a competition.
That's just unfair. :P
Hehe
aaahhh!! NEWBORN CUTIE!
05id rather play F:NV than skyrim
^
I was hooked on fallout unvierse in 1999, and I've never really been able to fully love another series
Wrek: exactly
F3 had a better story than FNV in my opinon
WTF IS THAT?!?!
Vivix: FO3 had the better story yes
is what?
but the overall gameplay in NEW vegas is better
Wrek: You wouldn't be alone, but I'm talking more fantasy-style WRPGs. There really aren't that many released. So Skyrim gets everyone's praise because....well, it's like one of the only ones
THAT GIANT BLUE THING
Bronysith: but wouldnt it be better than to FIND those things instead of just going to the store and buying it?
a tank I presume
oh
Bronysith Oh yes, yes that it is. I wish I could take FNV mecahnics and correct canon and transfer it into Fo3
The genre's not quite rolled over and died, but it's close enough. Most of the RPG makers have rolled over into the MMO genre. >_>
Major: also factions in new vegas. it is awesome so much. just like the original fallout games
that is one big tank
jinjle janle
CriticKitten: Fantasy WRPG? Oh man, you're right-- Skyrim is the only one I've seen other than witcher-
O-O
i still like FO1 Better than new vegas or FO3
cause i can KILLE VERYONE
HAHAHAHAHAH
Hehehe
F1 is <3
Quest givers
come to think of it, I don't think I've played a WRPG yet
DED
See? They just don't show up like they used to.
Oh. This song. I love Icky's remix of this.
PEOPLE DED
Bronysith why kill them>_>
F1 and F2 are WAY darker than Fo3, FNV is also darker, but a bit less focused
sorry
Bronysith: the fractions seem the same to me :/
Fractions.... PFFFFT
They're actually a lot harder to find now because RPG as a genre has sorta mixed itself into every other genre.
So you get all these other games with "RPG elements".
Fo3 had some issues, like weak drugs, no real penalty for addiction, not enough junkies, no negative effects from abusing JET- cheap items and "Forest = legend" and 3DOG--
But very few "pure" RPGs
Major: it just goes back to the heart of the original fallouts with seperate reputations
I know that JRPGs kinda flocked from consoles to handhelds
Major: also, FO1>FO3
yeah-
/me waits for it
Bronysith: but of course, every first game is the best game :P
05says will play F:NV and do whats best for mojave
but really RPG is a strange term
Dken2021: Doesn't help that they're starting to suck really bad, too. Look at Final Fantasy :P
05then sides with the fiends
05GOOD JOB THERE!
I mean, in F1 I was hated in Junktown, and loved everywhere else, cause I fucked up bad
Major: can you kill kids in fallout 3?
Bronysith: yes, with cheats :3
without cheats?
Major: doesnt count
Bronysith: You evil pony
D:
In F2 you can kill children, and they will steal things from you
if you have to have cheats or mods...it doesnt count
05you cant kill kids withotu mods in any recent bethesta game
nope
Fallout is--darker, F3 is kinda light compared to the original series, and got some aspects of the universe wrong
Bronysith what way will u kill them?
butthurt soccer moms
Bronysith: who wants to murder kids? Oh wait your mind does :/
Major: it just ruins the immersion of a game
No I nevr killed kids in F2, but I could
CrimsonPhoenix mmmyea could agree with ya there, some series seem to be in a rut
here you are in a supposedly realistic world
that was enough- especially since the thieving bastards woultd take stuff from me
Bronysith: you are a evil, evil person :/
Why cant i put a .44 magnum through a kids skull?
Bronysith: Craft a shield made of children, they're impenetrable
Hehehe
But yeah, the option is enough
Hello everypony.
if not, why not remove the kids from game?
Major: what? how is wanting to be fully immersed in a game evil?
Hay Pudge!
hai Pudge
in F3 you can't even sell kids into slavery, or inform the slavers of their escape plan
Bronysith: why would you want to kill kids in the first place, if you dont attack them it doesnt ruin the immersion
Wrek: do you play F:NV fullscreen or windowed?
Bronysith: Im more of a saint....
I got on steam and saw everyone playing TF2
Major: ha. thats a good joke
00,10cause the kinds can still call the guards
Major: I steal everything >.>
I STEAL ALL THE FRESH WATER
Hehe
ALL THE AMMO
Biglaw: and there can be forgivness for that :D
:3
KILL ALL THE QUEST GIVERs
F2 UK could not kill kids, F2 elsewhere you could, because kids aren't nice in that game, they steal, they lie- and sometimes- shit happens
Sumica: yeah, thats annoying...but still, rarely would you want to seriously kill people in a city anyway
DOMINATED! But I still love ya
i hate the mutants >_>
dat close call
Pudge: you lie, i'm not playing tf2 :P
I attack ghouls on sight, since I'm from a vault
Bronysith: you monster
^
twilight_sprinkle: so what? its a ROLE PLAYING GAME
Spectrum_Rush|Sad: dat fallout
You guys don't get it?
Vivix: I hate ghouls
i made a role and played it
Vivix: false gamers my friend
Yeah, they're evil in many situations
Hehe
Bronysith: if i ever play with you im killing you before you eat me :I
I never really killed innocent in F2, but sometimes you play and--they steal from you or something, and you just snap
twilight_sprinkle: Can I join you? :3
so does anyone have the mann vs machine update yet?
twilight_sprinkle: what? i only am like that in the game cause i want to play that way
05favorite moment in FO3 was when i discovered how powerful the combat shotgun was
Major: yesh :D
you get karma for each ghoul kill too so its a good deal
Wrek: Well it is a COMBAT Shotgun :D
Bronysith: evil!
Bronysith: EVIIIIIL
I got negative Karma for killing the ghouls that tried to kill people in pentenny poteorwe
and the evil spam
penptne..spelling
Wrek: not the mini nuke launcher?
05never liekd the fatboy
Bronysith ur evil and u love it
once I murdered an entire village
05the concept of miniature nukes
thelonepony: sith
05never liked it
same
thelonepony: OF COURSE IM EVIL
I like my rifles
and pistols
that was a different game though
There is no such thing as a "mini" Nuke
thing is, i cant bring myself to be evil in any karma based game, i cant even feel joyful when AI'm doing bad stuff in game, its like "oh im so naughty" and yet I dont enjoy it
FINALLY IT"S STREAMING AGAIN
ello Slenderman
PaladinDrakkenwolf: Obviously you haven't played Fable 2
the fat boy is like the a god weapon on Fo3
I almost never play bad, but --restrictions aren't fun
my first run through fallout NV i went pure 10mm handgun
Is tf2 free to play just a demo?
like IN skyrim, I genuinly disagreed wit hthe blades, yet can not attack them or leave them or join hrothgar or the dragons? Wtf?
Biglaw: I've played every fable, i have 3 on steam
pwny it's free
FUN FACT, you can make any weapon a god weapon depending on your weapon skills
i love killling fiends, mercs and mutants with it
pwny: F2P but you have to make a purchase in the store to get premium mode
Vivix: handholding
Yeah
Vivix: That's one of Skyrim's biggest flaws. For a world that presents itself as open and with lots of freedom and choice, you have very little actual freedom and choice.
I mean, why can't I disagree with the main storyline? I can in FNV
yeah-
Of course in NV too it is kinda fruitless to abandon house and join Ceasar, but you CAN
Vivix: free massive openworld gaming nowadays are "you can, but why would you want to?"
hehe
If I decide I'm going to enact a policy of killing everyone in Skyrim, I should be allowed to, damnit. :p
I tried to attack stormcloaks after joining imperial army
youre doomed
victory, then squish
FATALITY
dem fall
OOO! Wrek I have an idea for you, equip the Sword and ride the tank :D
05never liekd the concept of essential enteties in both fallout and elders crolls
I really want to be able to KILL people if I decide they need to die, kplzthx
u mean the quest dudes
yeah- it just makes no sense- I mean one of the most fun times in FNV was when I attacked ceasars legion, AGES spent just hiding and shooting and healing-
it was--awesome, I can't even look at a stormcloak camp?
05if a crucial character for the main storyline is brutalyl murdered by a random guy, then there should be a different story path coverign that
yeah
Vivix: is it too much to ask for the combat and open worldness of new vegas with the complexity and killing of everything in FO1?
05essential enteties=quest guys etc
hehe, yeah-
I mean- if you kill ceasar in FNV, a more brutal guy takes over
shame i wanted to play fallout, but i cant remember the keybinds
you never see him, because he's not near mojave
but--yeah, something happens
pony up boys
why?
05Vivix: yeah but thats not a problems sicne caesar isnt an essential
05then again
but I`m a bunny
05NV didnt have any afaik
Sumica i think the server stop responding
13morrowind did it best
13kill vivec
13take a brutal back path
00,10looks that way
no NV had no essentials, which was nice
ah the you cant kill them even if ya nuke them guys eh Wrek
/me just learned of these 2 new emotes >_> <_<
Vivix: well FO1s motto is great. "you can...dont know why you want to but go nuts kid"
lol
yeah, I loved that
it made me replay and replay so many times-
11,01Server crash?

Yes, otakon's connection is a zombie.
zombie hobbit!
Yup
Hi dari
alexxm: it's Caramel most likely
'cause it is for me
Because of the way it lurches, geddit?
and I made lobby bitches
Hey guys, somehow my login "Rainbow-Crash" is stuck logged in. Any idea how to disconnect it?

Woot, got it

Just like I always missed Luna's streams-
What are we watching?
hiya Dumori

It's Professor Duncan
I know kirzstryfe but that was ONE week
:P
I'm disguising my voice
in a MINI EGG
that's because they've shut during the week now, they used to be open full time
The hubby and I just got nack from Expendables II

side rooms kindo had weirdness and lots of newbiews not getting the oldguards injokes
DerpStar: you poor bastard
I imagine that was a pain to mod.
DerpStar how was it?
I enjoyed it
DerpStar: also didn't know you were married :P
mr Oliver always makes me think og Louis Theroux
DerpStar: good :)
Engaged
not too hard, just a lot to have open at once
We STILL have newbies not getting the injokes.

greetings ladies and gentlecolts, I am oni_link, and I am sunburnt.
0.o wat
wow that was a turnabout
hi oni_link
/me rubs oni_link
11,01Does anyone here know about the moderate-lived Leverage meme?
started visiting BS a couple of weeks before s2 aired
uh oh
and he finds out that he's been had out
Hi Everypony :)
I got Leverage explained to me once upon a time.
hi oni_link
Vivix: it hurts!!! D:
O.O
11,01kirzstryfe: Meaning I've been here longer than you.

/me cackles
Assburgers
I know of leverage
"I was a lawyer. I was paid to lie."
Community
but I wasn't present that week
I actually have Aspbergers
AJIsAwesome: Community?
assburgers
I have Asburgers .....
Hi there Canadian_Brony and CCCP
11,01I actually enjoyed Battlefield: Earth.
He's been had!
Oh look, Nitt has seniority.
I KNEW IT!
booyah
FREAK!
burned
So many people today claim they have so many different mental things :3
But seriously, Asperger's isn't cool to laugh at.
mfw all the people that say they have Aspergers
IIRC I have seniority ove like 70% of current mods
Yet can't spell it
Bronyhawk: I was diagnosed when I was 2
IKR
11,01I have membership seniority, not staff seniority.
well
X3
Yes, but mod status overrides regular member seniority.
me neither
otakon, not saying you specifically don't have it, I'm just saying alot of people use it as an easy out
/me knows all about your hiarachy...
11,01I think kirz got in around the October hires. I joined in January.
yeah
nah, I was last round of hires in January
All of us naked clods are all the same, really.
Vivix how do you slepp?
I was Diagnosed with ADHD and MBD as a kid, teachers told me to "Take a run outside" rather than- try to help me
its generally high functioning autism though
sleep? pfffffffffffffttttttttt.................
I sleep well, you?
I didn't do this right, OPH I have dyslexia and aspergers...OH and I'm Autistic
http://www.seriouseats.com/images/20100225-tacocat.jpg yummy
Then who was phone Canadian_Brony??
So many people it's sad
Oh, are we comparing disorders?
ADHD isn't so bad, maaany people use it as an excuse though
I missed out on the august hires last year
The white, uncoloured masses.
"I can't help throwing shit at you! I GO ADHD!"
oni_link . . . I don't get it.
/me hugs Canadian_Brony
He was had
/me glomps CCCP
/me huggies Bronyhawk
/me was hugged
and then my email got hacked for a few months
/me hugs erryday
Tourette's Syndrome here, no I don't swear all the time, thanks much.
:)
so I could read my reply
That dick scammed him?
Reikim: I knew someone that had that
Yeah, I know of some tourette people who never curse- just ticks
...Bronystate is watching community...:) It's beautiful
lol
SpadeMagnes[R]: not really, he gave back the keys
lol
otakon: What degree?
still i think that us aspies are just wired differently than other people
Reikim: it was minor, he had muscle twitches really
I think that's part of the diagnose, I'm not sure
I'm no--psychologist
LightningDashFast: oh definitely
The eye tics cause people to doubt your sanity. But really, that's not the reason they ought to doubt mine. They have plenty of others to choose from~
Reikim: I don't know why people associate Tourettes with swearing. It's mostly twitching, really.
Jokes, mostly
AJIsAwesome: Tourette's guy, whom I cannot hate because he's damn funny.
la
AJIsAwesome: they associate it with swearing because of south park
yeah
for whatever reason i just didnt bother applying in December...
Caramel: dude before that I'm sure
Back I hope
Reikim: I was going to say that, too.:D
I didn't apply because...I did not exist.
they say that Albert Einstien was an aspie
I am marked as needing extra time in school for ADD, but I never need it because I don't have it. Doctors these days will just say someone has this and that or people will self diagnose because it's easy.
BY then I'd decided I'd rather not
Caramel another good reason why I will never watch it.
wb DerpStar did you have to put yer hubby to bed?
Oh did I miss the end?
i'm back. dad nag me to leave
DerpStar: yh just barely
back then i didnt know bstate well enough i guess
ADHD is measurable though, but not everyone reacts the same as its an umbrella term
11,01You were Jan kirz? My memory fails me again.
WB thelonepony
thelonepony: Welcome back!:)
He didn't need much convincing he was tired
I don't have anger or..anything, I just can't focus very well
thelonepony: well that sucks
Canadian_Brony: ah ill send you the corresponding link when I get home, Chrome derps when I copy paste...
You hang around the IRC long enough and all the chats tend to flow together.
lol
my dad has to see his futbol
okay . . .
every ten minutes
4th wall broken much?
or in english soccer
Otakon you're sweet for asking
DAT 4th wall reference
I just idle these days
yeah, but I'm sneaky like that
Abed is best pony
^
wasnt SuperBrony an October hire?
Ahahahaha
https://images.4chan.org/x/src/1345516548690.png
thelonepony: wait you watch futbol on the same screen as your computer?
plus I cba with BMN atm
The only annoying bit about Tourette's is the fact that I broke my damn mouse due to finger tics.
!
Yeah
sometime i feel obsessed on certain things like MLP but sometimes thats a good thing
Abed would be a great pony
yeah so i thought
I'm banned from 4chan :( can't go to that link
hmm... is anything on atm? im on my phone
CCCP: the fuck is that in the background
Lawl
Spoilers
oni_link: it's Community being streamed by Caramel
otakon Slenderman :3
Brony I hope it was for posting ponies
no i'm using my latop an i was in the the LIving room
Bronyhawk I'm going to regret this. How did you get banned from 4chan?
DOn't spoil my news !!
CCCP: fuck me that gave me chills
CNN is my favorite show!!
Back from mah shower
oh thanks otakon
otakon oh sorry! *hugs*
Canadian_Brony: I got banned for trying to spam out certain threads that shouldn't be online. Of course I used ponies to spam :3
/me Has never been on 4chan

Ponies47 nice shower i hope
Cirno News Network? oh wait nobody else will get that meme...
Ponies47: Welcome back!:)
They denied my appeal xD
Bronyhawk: much respect

Bronyhawk: howd that happen?
Bronyhawk Mods are awake. Post ponies.
Bronyhawk: you were a pony spammer

oni_link: Some people just don't like ponies.:(
thelonepony: Shower was good. YES

Thanks AJIsAwesome
Bronyhawk: I raise my drink to you *cheers*
haters gonna hate
I think we've had some "who would make an okay mod" discussions
Well guys, I'm gonna go lay down now, gnyte!
those fortune tellers are fun
One or two, maybe.
It's funny because they ban me for ponies but not the people who post HIGHLY illegal stuff. So I take it as a small victory I suppose.
I used to make those in highschool
g'night Vivix
Vivix: Night!
Vivix you should go sometime
/me waves to all and to none
night Vivix

So anyone who uses Chrome on ICS know why it force closes when I try to cut, copy or paste?
13so protip for those of you that use screensnapr
I have a MLP shot game with the hubby
13apparently they've been so horribly flaky lately because they're being massively DDOSed
hi Shizuka
confound these ponies they drive me to drink
13like massively massively DDOSed
Shizuka: I was wondering about that!
0_o
wub
what does that mean?
Like, massively?
Shizuka: Did they piss the wrong people off?
I had an image I made on that that I loved
but I haven't been able to access it for weeks
well, someone else made
but the point still stands
:O
13caught their twitter a couple days ago, they're trying to figure out how to fend it off
13but clearly it's been going on for weeks
yeah a DDoS attack can cripple severs horribly for hours
Canadian_Brony: It's when the server goes down via hacking or overexertion
servers*

this community?
yes
yes it is
it's hilarious
So lets say I know somepony who's in love with their supervisor at work who is 3 years older than him, and probably already has a boyfriend, but shes so nice, intelligent, and cute, it's tearing him up to keep silent
Was that pinkie's party sounds?
Yes!:D
/me is out of cookies, and glass of milk is empty
IshPonyPony: dude just ask her
IshPonyPony: at the very least you'll get it off your chest
lol wut
00,10he can write in wingdings
otakon no
can you play tf2 with vista?
IshPonyPony, Seize the day
IshPonyPony: Your "friend" should pony up and ask her to a movie :)
lol da hell did he write?
IshPonyPony: yeah the whole "my friend' deal NEVER flies.
is there no way to join a survival game right ?
IshPonyPony: TELL HER and AWAIT THE RESULTS
stoner tree
Need I remind you "supervisor" and "probably has a boyfriend"
If she says no then so what? Plenty more ponies in the barn.
IshPonyPony: just ASK
no
Friendzoned
IshPonyPony: if she has a boyfriend, move on. if not just ask.
IshPonyPony: This sounds cliche, but tell her how you feel. Even if you get shot down, you'll still have closure.
^then dont ask what to do
The doctor!
I should know.
Its not asking her out that I need advice on, it's moving on
IshPonyPony, Women like to be hit on anyway
while keeping silent
IshPonyPony: say "Hey, I need to get this off my chest but I've grown to really like you and for my own sake I need to know two things: Do you have a boyfriend, and if not could we work?"
I love John Oliver
he's damn funny
otakon: Well put, otakon.
...Just remembered why I hate drawing technology on a large scale.
IshPonyPony: Just keep your mind busy in other stuff...trust me it's the easiest way to get over someone. And never I repeat NEVER actively look for someone. It will bring bad results, trust me.
lol
13what you mean trixie?
Ahahaha
ugh im gonna go watch TV then fall asleep
lol
also make sure to take the spaghetti out of your pocket before hand
Looks like Ohura's headset
from Star Trek
just to get this straight, otakon is giving shipping advice?
lol
Yeah, you don't want all that spaghetti spilling out of your pockets.
otakon is best shipping advisor.
dating =/= shipping
Troy is an accurate depiction Tumblr
shipping is just mindless stupidity fans throw on characters
I'm not telling her, I don't want to have to leave work in order to prevent creating an uncomfortable environment for the both of us
like people joining the game i currently playing
And he's Pheobe
13oh
/me has a whip
13not unless you open to LAN... which opens to LAN
the hipster...it's too much...
IshPonyPony: It's only uncomfortable if you make it that way.
13or copy the world folders to a server
I'm not one to ship, but if you do more power to you. I don't really care.
13like i did
oookay
13basically the open to lan button would let people on your network join in, but not the internet
well i cant play tf2, my computers lags, just great
IshPonyPony: Then your best option is to get over her.
IshPonyPony: If she says no then both of you just drop it and move on with your lives.
13running a server would take port forwarding and blah blah blah but that would be open to internet
Just got here, what is this?
00,10did't they do this on that british sudo science show?
Dovah gives good advice
me as well? what is this
probably
i gues hamachi is my friend in this one
13also i just realized wandering around my cabin i'm pretty much out of ideas for minecraft...
Dovah is best pony
also after this ep I think I'm gonna go to bed
Bronyhawk It will be uncomfortable because she probably won't be sure she wants to be around me fully knowing my feelings for her
Applechip: Community

I like paintball

DB_Brony: actually you're right

Canadian_Brony: (\
Fawlty Towers is best game over
I mean I know what Fawlty Towers is
aside from Mornington Crescent
Sumica: Well I don't really much watch BBC (expect for Doctor Who), but yeah, he does sound british.
13zombie pigmen spawn near nether portals now
but I don't get the joke
I don't
Canadian_Brony You don't what?
Fawlty Towers should be streamed here at some point
what is Fawlty Towers? Is it a tower defense?
Boulder?
Also, Keeping Up Appearances!
I went there in Fallout New Vegas
Canadian_Brony sorry :$ if i could i would ya some. plus my sis' homemade meatloaf,AWESOME
Polydunami as well as Blackadder
IshPonyPony what Fawly Towers is
Canadian_Brony: it was a british sitcom
is the spawn point dependant on the random seed, or is it different even if the seed is the same?
didn't know that i guess i should move the portal from the top of my house
I love british sitcom
Is cratorkid still typing the story?:)
Canadian_Brony Bwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa?
Sketch_Toku_Brony my sister is too young to cook
Dat face
13i think
otakon no wonder.
AJIsAwesome i already typed it
tiny piece of paper
Polydunami owns two copies of Fawlty Towers on DVD :3
Blackadder goes forth!
13it starts from 0,0 but can be like within 500 blocks in any direction
lol
Kumar
kumar
lol kumar
cratorkid: Oh. :$
wait waht?
creepy
Canadian_Brony you have failed us with your lack of knowledhe
I loved Blackadder Unnr
he can't do that
*knowledge
Zehhhro
00,10So just retest
that's not fair
AJIsAwesome: its a huge wall cant mis it
13i'm not sure if the initial spawn point is tied to the seed now or if it's still random separate from the seed
oh my sis is in her 30's :$ im the youngest,my bro is middle
lol
DerpStar: Blackadder is such a great weasle
suddenly caricature
otakon its called abluff?
so Dari, the next show I stream after this, should it be Yes Minister, or Black Books?
IshPonyPony you have failed me with your fail spelling of "knowledge"
Caramel: I vote yes minister
Do you know who John Cleese is, Canadian_Brony?
Roll a die
:P
lol
Quote of the year
cratorkid: It didn't finish for me. PM me?
Once I first saw Blackadder, It instantly made number 2 on my list of funniest things
lol
what?
sure AJIsAwesome
Caramel: Black books!!!!!
it was Brita
Polydunami . . . . . . nope.
but if we're playing that Dari, I have to rape House Bannister
Oh
I'm guessing
How about Monty Python?
Blackadder, was written by a fox who went to oxford and got a degree in cunnning plans
not the rape jokes...
I know him
Polydunami number 1
Him?
Or THEM!? :3
well, funny story
Anyone watch Red Dwarf?
Moo ^-^
lol
LiarAbed
Bronyhawk lol nope
YES
You're a bloody smeg head Bronyhawk
Bronyhawk: I streamed them a few months ago
Bronyhawk YES!!
the seed "Shizuka" drops you into a tundra biome to start :3
We saw Red Dwarf here on Bronystate at one point

Maid_RainBow: Famous for the * Vacation series, and SNL
Make me fool!
La Mooseeka
It was that one guy

0_o
otakon : it was on the tip of my tongue
I bet it was the teacher
otakon: im not in college yet
lol
:D
superretroworld: well good luck when you get there
:D
so she got failed?
and he became a professor how?
IshPonyPony: I have no idea
otakon: sorry i thought youre other comment was to me
"We are mature!" The class threw crumpled paper at her.
goddammit
that's it
I never did that
and he became a dean how?
I'm getting Minecraft
Like a University
The dean is awesome
when I get a chance to add funds to paypal
^
hah, I'm going to university instead of college
Its still amazing that Rowan Atkinson took a MSc in electrical engineering
isn't ath the same thing?
Dean ya later
minecraft does not take paypal anymore as far as i know

:D
It isn't working.

I didn't mean ME :S

Canadian_Brony: you a fan of this show?
Lol

Well, the show

superretroworld this is the first time watching this.
WEASLEY IS OUR KING!
ZING
HE DIDN'T LET THE QUAFFLE IN! WEASLEY IS OUR KING!
:D
I'd probably go with Blackadder, even though Mr. Bean has more nostalgia for me
The bald guy is the principal from that disney sitcom, Phill of the Future?
SO MUCH CANTERLOCK
I do have a credit card
VenHur: Eeyup
IshPonyPony: While Blackadder had a clever and witty plot, it lacked the cultural impact that Mr. Bean has
I just channel it through paypal to make online purchases
Old man Scootaloo can't write music
I remember Mr. Bean fondly
Canadian_Brony: then probaly my computers slow cause i keep seeing your phrases on the show before show says it
DerpStar Cultural impact is not a factor in this
who's blackadder?
just who you think is better
superretroworld my stream is a bit behind too. Refresh often
IshPonyPony: Blackadder after the first season
Mr. Bean playing with the nativity scene, anypony? :3
chiness nsjdf haha
I've never seen Blackadder
^
Polydunami: lol I did
otakon: O_O

Why is an asian guy a spanish teacher instead of a spanish guy?
pfft, sanity
IshPonyPony: bc it's FUNNY
THAT is why
otakon: no excuse, its blackadder
I only caught Blackadder on Youtube :P
11,01Question: How would you all feel about more Bronystate staff doing live Q and As?
I've never even heard of it
IshPonyPony: Blackadder was a great show for the educated and those with a strong graso of history, Mr. Bean appealed to all

omg Twins....;)
Canadian_Brony: God is Princess Celetia
Celestia'
I AM Captain Universe!
DerpStar she is a goddess, as is Derpy.
MASF123: :D
We're talking about Zodiac signs and boobs.
?? :S
glorious boobs
Polydunami seems legit
the mega church
"I'm the best and finished on top" sounds like my mom HEY-O
Canadian_Brony: You saw that post, too?
Final stage
chat derped, did i miss anything?
Zodiac signs are what give boobs their power over us men.
Saxoffender 0_o lol
Canadian_Brony: Celestia, is the only God/Godess thus God
NocturnalBlade: talk of boobs
<DerpStar>Celestia'
<MASF123>I AM Captain Universe!
NocturnalBlade: Not really
That's pretty much it :P
Without them boobs are powerless to stop us.
MASF123: how?
AJIsAwesome the one with 6 ponies and their blessings, in which it says Derpy is the Goddess of Chance?
THIS ONE
Canadian_Brony: Yeah.
WE STARTED WITH THIS ONE!
dat 4th wall
Ladies and gents the 4th wall is gone....
dat tiny trophy
DAT 4TH WALL BREAK
He is breaking it so hard.
DerpStar tell that to anyone who knows about Hylian mythology. (AKA me)
XD
lol
Uploading first sketch
He learned from the best.....:O
twilight_sprinkle: what 4th wall? it dissapeard
It's very rough, with only the most basic of detaisl
Suddenly the chat shifts.from bewbs to zodiac
Canadian_Brony: Ok I'm telling you Celestia is God
Milky Ways, Mars Bars, and pancakes.
The 4th Wall has been broken
OWNED!
it's her's
by Pinkie
DerpStar:
DAMMIT
:p
sorry!
lol
and now from zodiac to 4th wall breaking
boobs that break the fourth wall
chat derp
nope
Oh my
otakon: *facehoof*
Lol.
MASF123: now we can hug the ponies
This may sound stupid, but I was never explained nor told why girls go to the bathroom together.....:S
just me going insane
Girls talk. Isn't that enough?
AJIsAwesome: no idea, they always seemed to travel in packs
lol
otakon that would be ground breaking.
AJIsAwesome: They are talkative creatures. They need the time to talk.
dam i wanted to hear that raant
MASF123: only if they were big enough
:P
I talk, its never enough Polydunami
Also some lines scanned better than others, unfortunately.
superretroworld...I would hug Pinkie
Allright. I feel so dumb....:$
Or erect enough
MASF123: better question is who wouldn't?
I just noticed. Birtta and Troy are the two halfs of Tumblr. The Activist Side and the Immature Side.
Oh Choose the Village people
they can cut glass
I'm not very talkative IRL :P
tends to happen
Or here, for that matter
Oh I am
MASF123: group hug from the main would be a dream
lol
http://i.imgur.com/y8tSA.jpg ;-;
Well, part of it is that it's a very rough sketch
Living in Equestria would be my dream.
That I did in maybe half an hour?
DerpStar because there is only one divine and holy figure (IE the goddess Celestia) does not automatically entitle them as God. Princess Celestia is the Goddess of the Sun and ruler of Equestria. AKA not god
everfree was awsome:D

11,02Sketch_Toku_Brony: Indeed :D
Could you tell us what music you're playing?
Never mind, there's a pony with the name of DeathStar who is from New Zealand :P
11,02twilight_sprinkle: Can you send me a pic of it? :)
No Polydunami I'm from a sane country
aw man now i wanna get some :D
JRP, what's the reasoning for that number?
Polydunami: you called?
00,02i hear pistons
Just kidding Kiwis are awesome
DerpStar . . . AHA! I saw the flag!
Lol Wormwood, you're getting played with.
00,10Mentlegen, I belive it's time to Mann up
SuperBrony64: i guess i could try, but that would take some time
hi Phase4. Shizuka is streaming Minecraft. That was her elevator
Yeah, two different people, DerpStar and DeathStar x3
Pony cards are $2, what a deal!
Sumica: Whuzzat?
Sumica not for me. TF2 won't run on my computer
00,02looks like a zip elevator
DerpStar: oh hey there :D
Jmo, I'm just curious if there actually is a reasoning to what he's saying.
There isn't.
11,01Sumica: You have a ticket?
00,10yeah
11,01Or a Squad ticket?
I would be all for manning up. Testosterone shots are fun stuff.
He's just bored.
DeathStar: Hai hun *hugs*
This is bitchin mincreaft
00,10single use atm
This music is so ambient <3
Jmo, oh, alright then.
/me hugs DerpStar back " I haven't seen you in a while"
the music is relaxsing
Wtf
Sumica all tickets are single use if you win IIRC.
This song's title must be made known.
00,02Sumica, i has tickets
unless you mean you only have 1 ticket
DeathStar: I've been wicked busy
How does Mann Up Mode work anyway?
00,10then log in Phase4, if yah want
DeathStar: fair enough
also I got Civ V
Dat self ping.
Amazon pissed me off today. Or rather a seller on Amazon. :[
/me is confused
that eats up time
00,02i got beta access to the steam community
Mystic River, huh?
Whoa, that's impressive
11,02I want a beta access Phase4 O.O
I've heard of Rozen Maiden
This guy wants this dream gaming computer with 2gb VRAM and 16 g ram quad core. Just for msword
its a nice anime about dolls
Reikim a team of 6 fights off waves of bots who drop cash when they die. The cash can be used to upgrade your weapons and skill. Ammo capacity, clip size, firing speed, movement speed, resistance, blah blah blah.
I thought everyone got it SuperBrony64 >.>
well he'll type like a boss JRP
thats a cool room
00,02SuperBrony64, if i can i'll send you one
00,02was gifted it
00,10So we got 3 on the team, got room for 3 more
I know how MvM works, I was asking about Mann Up SPECIFICALLY.
11,02Oh wait, I actually got one now.
Sumica: I need a ticket to play, don't I?
>.>
00,10aye
11,02Nvm :)
Silly SuperBrony64
00,02XD
/me has no tickets, unfortunately
I don't play MC
Sumica: yall doin Mann Up Mode?
00,10yeah
i now where u could get tickets>_>
Reikim: in the same boat
thelonepony: Buy them.
Dat Minecraft :3
this reminds me. anyone got a link to a minecraft fill mod?
Reikim oh. Mann Up Mode is significantly harder than the usual "Boot Camp". You need a ticket to enter and it's only used if you win. If you leave before winning, the ticket will not be spent
'gulp' i going for my license tommorow
00,02you can get the 'advance' modes on normal servers
00,02only difference is item drops
lol this mincrafft is reminding me of the funny but creepy animated vid where this creeper gets rape 0_o :D
Jmo: which ones?
AWPer hand.
00,02aparently mann up is full of loot
What type of blocks are those?
Beautiful
Apparently. If you win.
Jmo: oh
What type of blocks are those?
00,10indeed it is
I really enjoy music
Sorry, too cheap to buy items.
Eulshy: Legos.
Eulshy: Jk jk.
VenHur, You should do stand up
Well I'm off everypony, *hugs DeathStar and Canadian_Brony* leaves cookies for everypony else, I'm going to slip in bed with the hubby
Oh, hey Shizu, I see you got your portal system working.
Goodnight DerpStar
Phase4 depends on if you use vouchers. The more vouchers used, the more loot you win at the end. If you complete a whole tour, you get a botkiller.
g'night DerpStar
bye DerpStar
Great, I gotta pay for shipping now because someone tried ripping me off on Amazon...
nite DerpStar
Reikim: are tickets drop-able?
night DerpStar
bye DerpStar
NocturnalBlade: Not that I know.
NocturnalBlade no, you buy them
He can swing his sword sword
$1 each
Canadian_Brony: damn
Bye DerpStar
00,02you dont loose a ticket unless you complete a round
IIRC, traded for a little over 2 ref.
Bloody Valve. At least they're nice enough to let us use them until we win.
Phase4 same for surplus vouchers
Whats that gold looking stuff?
00,02Canadian_Brony, in that case
/me 00,02has two
did stream derp for u guys?
...?
I should look this anime up someday; I've heard a lot about it
Phase4 wait . . . I'm not entirely sure. Gimme a minute.
thelonepony: Nope.
I'm sure about tickets, but I have second thoughts about vouchers
well refresh for me
cooool
brb
Reikim: i heard steam doesnt support vista, do you know if thats true?
You can use a squad ticket in Mann Up
you broke the world shizuka...
Steam should support Vista
every time asian women ads
Where did my world go? :S
Found the end of the minecraft map finally? =P
Polydunami: Hm, which anime?
f the ads
then probaly my computers slow :[
I don't know what's with the whole ticket thing, but I don't have one yet.
Rozen Maiden, Reikim
fuck the ads
00,02Barbetos, there is an end :P lookup 'farlands'
Ah, Rozen Maiden
00,02thelonepony, adblock
Which has been mentioned on stream, actually
Oblivion soundtrack
Wait, official Oblivion music?
Barbetos: Probably not for a while :P http://www.crackajack.de/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/scale.jpg
Phase4 "If the mission is not cleared successfully, the voucher will not be consumed and no item will be redeemed."
suddenly, fire hazard!
I stopped using Firefox because of memory leaks... I really miss ABP though
00,02Canadian_Brony, awesome
Oblivion: Skyrim before Skyrim was cool
Petrified_Discord that is a cool program
Scale of the Universe
Polydunami: Yup :)
VenHur: don't you mean Elder Scrolls before it was cool

Ponies47 IKR? And I can't figure out why! I know my graphics card can play it because I used it on my old computer and played it there. I have 3GB of RAM which is more than enough, but I think it's because I'm running Vista. The only other option I can think of would be to scrap Vista for XP or find a 64-bit Vista and get more RAM.
hey! Minecraft!
I was just playing that
Polydunami . . . okay . . .
VenHur: It hasen't but it looks like it's gonna soon
and then shizuka killed every living being in the world
Canadian_Brony - 3gb of ram should be more than enough
Is SuperBrony64 streaming
?
My ads think I'm creepy
Pinkies4thWall|NOM - shizuka
I'm telling you, Endermen scare me everytime
Canadian_Brony: Intresting. Maybe you should

Speaking of Windows, who here has seen/used the beta release of Windows 8? To me, it looks nothing like Windows at all. :(
i have to sit here to see what this building becomes
VenHur - that's cause it's nothing like windows as we know it
VenHur: Im not liking Windows 8

/me is now depressed
win9 may fail too :P
Win 8 does have a desktop
00,02Shizuka, assuming theres a 9

NocturnalBlade: i have the same problem, dont worry
Ponies47: no prob
Reikim: aeris

00,10well I have a couple spare tickets I could trade if people are willing to try.
MrEvergreen: WOW. JUST. WOW. I knew something happened at EFNW, but I didn't know it would escalate to something like this. :O
And it's the good piano mix, too.
NocturnalBlade: Steam can't find you :/
Aaaah, what do I have to trade...
Sumica: Hold that thought, gotta look at my inventory
Sumica: that would be cool...what you want for them?
Ponies47: try goku30024
My dog always fights me for my blanket
And he's THIRTEEN :S
Hmm... I feel like playing MvM but I hate waiting to find a lobby
Polydunami: My cat always takes my bed
Sumica: Is there an easy way for me to check what I have to trade?
My brother and I found an abandoned mine in Minecraft. We only played maybe 3 nights. It's cool going through it
I'm not in my bedroom atm, actually
Reikim: go to google and type TF2 Backpack, that should work
NocturnalBlade: I've got my backpack open, I've got to see whether or not they're tradable.
Reikim: oh
sleepy time, have a good night everypony :)
00,10well get on steam so I can invite first
nite kirzstryfe
MrEvergreen: And considering the fact that people are insulting her for her opinion disturbs me even more. She does bring up a valid point, though. There is a certain extent you will reach before it starts to offend people, even if it's just a joke. Thank you so much for posting this here. It's kind of disappointing how low they went.:(
computer crashed
NocturnalBlade: Find ya! Added you and I'l lsend you an invite to both the bronystate groups
night kirzstryfe
Whoa
g'night kirzstryfe. That's a really good drawing BTW
Canadian_Brony: nuuuuuuu

All of a sudden
kirzstryfe: Night!
oni_link yeah. Piece of sh*t
Why do I know this song?
Dovakhin
Skyrim ^^
tthis song is from morrowind
Oh, Morrowind
aw
Well, they all have it :P
MrEvergreen: Well, it's not a good thing to see, but thanks for showing me. It depresses the hell out of me, but it's better to know than not ot.
*to
Canadian_Brony: I feel that way with my laptop. its been crapping out on me alot more
Sorry, I'm not well versed in Elder Scrolls :S
00,02There it is
I think I has a hunch Shizuka is a harcore Elder Scrolls fan.
00,02the elder scrolls 'corous'
NocturnalBlade: I invited you to BOTH of the bronystate groups :P
00,02love that <3
Sigh...
Phase4: 999999999999999999999999
Immaturity is still rampant it seems.
00,02MrEvergreen, ?
Ponies47: again, thanks ^_^
I loved Morrowind so much!<3
/me Has never played Skyrim
NocturnalBlade: Your welcome ^_^
Phase4: Bad behaviour at the con. Someone complained, and got hatemail. It is depressing.
Anypony wanna play MvM? otherwise I might hop on Halo 2 and try to beat campaign.
I don't has Skyrim yet, but I did seen some gameplay of it...do want.
Anyone can recommend me a good fanfic?
Dang it ads, why do you show me Russian women xP
MASF123|afk: mine :P

Polydunami: maybe its telling you something?

Wait, Knytt Stories!?

Poke
Pppppp
"world's largest..." what?
Phase4 IIRC you have a reputation for being good at tech stuff. Do you think you could give me some sense of why I can't run TF2 on Vista with 3GB of RAM when XP will run it with 2GB?
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/6515/Days-of-Wasp-and-Spider I was impressed with
Phase4 Google isn't giving me anything useful and
Canadian_Brony - does it give any specific error messages?
or does it just crash
00,02Canadian_Brony, define 'cant run'?
JRP: So what happend to dem numbers you had in your nick before? :P
Canadian_Brony: It might just be a compatability issue. Im not familiar with Vista but is there an option to run it in compatibilitymode?
Canadian_Brony: im having the same problem, does it run slow or something?
Lazy
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/26633/Twilight-needs-a-new-Quill too
MINECRAFT
The only 2 fanfics I've kind of read :P
oni_link - compatibility shouldn't be an issue; windows 7 x64 can run it as is
as can xp x32
MASF123|afk look up "The Best Night Ever" by Capn_Chryssalid
MirrorImage Phase4 superretroworld I start up TF2 and I get as far as the "Valve" screen before my computer crashes
JRP: Ah. Also. I sent you a friend request on Steam :P
Ok
I'm at work ATM
http://www.fimfiction.net/index.php?view=category&user=30937 my stories of course
computer as in Blue Screan of Death, or computer as in just the game and you go back to desktop?
I got it to work once, but I had lag beyond playability
00,02Canadian_Brony, bizare, you have teamviewer?
So cant accept yet
Prince Blueblood experiences the Grand Galloping Gala. Over and over again.
Phase4 I don't know what that is, so probably not
JRP: Just letting you know :P
MirrorImage: yeah but I think that Vista wasn't tested for compatibility. I know alot of XP stuff didn't work on Vista as is.
/me 11,01explodes
Canadian_Brony: i can only go to he loading screens
Nittany_Discord O U
00,02Canadian_Brony, have steam verify the game files
Canadian_Brony - is it your entire computer that crashes (blue screen of death) or just the game?
aw man, its midnight. I better get to bed
00,02Canadian_Brony, also try opening cmd.exe as administrator then run sfc /scannow
MirrorImage the entire computer
flutter_spin: Night!
...so blue screen of death? ouch
I have to be up early tomorrow; local food bank needs volunteers :P
Phase4 how do I do that?

Sumica: Absolutely zilch to trade, sorry
Pinkies4thWall: So cute.:)
Pinkies4thWall: catch it. now.
Not quite, PillowPoni :3
00,02Canadian_Brony, open the start menu, type cmd.exe, then right click what shows up and click run as administrator
Polydunami :3
00,10I said dont wory about it
Hm?
You know, i looked at the time and wondered to myself, "Why am I still watching this?"
Pinkies4thWall: Get. a Pokeball. NOW.
k thx
With my computer be such a piece of junk and such. My mother seems to wanna give me a hand with getting me a new one. She says when she gets payed she's gonna use some of her money to get me a new computer or give me some money to help me save for a new computer! :3
This song is awesome
Pinkies4thWall: did you make that?
/me catches female Pikachu pony
Ponies47: Huzzah!!!!!
I love this song you're playing.
superretroworld: no
what is the IP for this server?
/me can't art
oni_link: IKR? I'm so excited! : D
oh
Ponies47: build a custom built computer if you can swing it ^^
Pinkies4thWall same. I can build a decent house in Minecraft, but that be it
or a rollercoaster
in RCT
Ponies47: Freakin awesome man, do you know what you wanna get?
Basenji: My mom's boyfriends brother did. It looked pretty cool buy the Internet wouldn't work on it :/
00,02Guys: we need 2 more players for mann up, you need a ticket
Canadian_Brony - next time your tf2 crashes and you get a blue screen, take note of what the error message is - should be a short phrase that uses underscores instead of spaces
Canadian_Brony: :) RCT3 is epic
does shizuka know the goal to minecraft?
Phase4: i did the same thing, will that do the trick or do i need to do more?
that helps to figure out exactly what caused the crash - i almost want to bet memory
oni_link: IDK yet. I hoep a good computer that will ast and will be able to paly TF2 and such. But i can't decide on a laptop or desktop :/
Phase4 I have a ticket
MirrorImage the blue screen stays around for all about 5 seconds until it automatically restarts
and survive at night time in a house
00,02superretroworld, it may or may not do anything, its the 'fix simple problems' command
00,02Eulshy, ^_^ want to join?
This song
oh
Phase4 sure
00,10do I have you on steam Eulshy?
Shizuka ist best awesome architect
Ponies47: *succeskid.jpg*
Canadian_Brony - all i can say then is look quick - it should be the second paragraph at the top if its laid out like i think it is
minecraft didnt have creative mode when alpha came out
00,02Eulshy, add me, i'm Phase4 on steam
I'm not much for RT3. I'm old school and like RCT and RCT2 more B)
*RCT3
00,02Sumica, i'll invite, easier for me to part and rejoin than re-add everyone
Pinkies4thWall IKR? I've seen stuff on Youtube and I've played a demo before. I can't wait for RCT for the 3DS. /)^3^(\
kaykay
00,10can you add?
Phase4: I love your avatar! :3
Phase4: Same here, i'll add ya.
yay the ports work it seems :D
Phase4, which Phase4?
Ponies47: You can build a desktop on websites and they mail that configuration pre-built to you. Also, Desktops are cheaper but I dont know if you want that or something you can take on the go
/me 00,02hugs Ponies47
VenHur: IKR?
Canadian_Brony: i was talking about RCT3 for PC
00,02Eulshy, theres more tha one?
Phase4, alot
/me Hugs Phase4 back
00,02Eulshy, thats suprising
THOSE FUCKING ENDERMEN
00,02Shizuka, also, lot of snowmen back there
Pinkies4thWall I know. There will also be one for the 3DS.
Whelp, seems Valve doesn't like f2p for once...or they just don't like ticket trading.
Phase4 Ironically thers only 4
I want both!
oni_link: you can have websites that build it but I find its cheaper buying the parts your self and building it your self its also alot of fun only if you know what your doing though i guess
I have all 3 of the Rollar Coaster Tycoons nad all the add on packs. My favorite is still the first one :3
Phase4: Your avatar the ones with Derpy, right?
00,02i'm the one with a derpy avatar
Oh.
I bid you all good luck on your tour of duty through robotic hell, and I wish you all a good night.
Canadian_Brony: sadly, my disc of RCT3 snapped
*and
00,02VenHur, yes XD
00,10Phase4, will it let you add?
I added you Phase4
/me bows and exits
00,02Sumica, yeah

Basenji: yeah I know. I wanna build one myself next year but I was just letting Ponies47 know for simplicities sake :P
00,02hmm, seems i'm seeing the same bug
00,02Sumica, re-invite me after i part
is there a way to move that exit portal?
On Steam, I'm VenHur, my avatar is the Bat Credit Card.
00,10oki
Eulshy and VenHur I add you guys on STeam correct?
oni_link: Ok then :P
Phase4, so...?
Ponies47: Eeyup.
Pinkies4thWall ouch. I'm just going to get a download code online. I haven't seen RCT3 locally in 7 years atleast
00,10the interface is clunky Eulshy
And seriously, my avatar is the Bat Credit Card, your arguement is invalid.
VenHur: Sorry to ask. But sometiems I can't remeber. XD
RCT needs to go 4.
Ponies47: TBH, Im gonna get a laptop sometime this year and next year I save up for a desktop :P
00,10people just added to friends list wont show up un less you exit and rejoin party
00,02there we go

superretroworld: I think I forgot to add you on Steam last night. Steam name please?
Polydunami: Clannad :'(
USHIO!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ponies47: no i got you
Ponies47 not that I think about it, my friend's list is way bigger than yours, but he's a mass-trader.
Do you know what I'm talking about, oni_link? The song that plays in the illusionary world.
Ponies47 therefore I don't count most of them as "friends" so to speak
OMG FUS RO DAWW: http://derpy.me/reOK7
superretroworld: Oh yeah. I forget these things! xP
Or whatever it's called
Canadian_Brony: I see.

/me throws a muffin at YourLittleDashie
YourLittleDashie - there's an easy way to fix that
Canadian_Brony: Thanks for the free muffin!
go to fimfiction, find a highly rated fic with the Random tag, and read it in the voice of Morgan Freeman
/me om nom nom nom
11,01oni_link: It helps my figure. Want one?
11,01:p
MirrorImage . . . Naked Singularity.
I need to see more of this anime.
that's the first one that comes to mind
Shizuka: You really make some good Minecraft stuff. I apperciate your work on it.
Nittany_Discord: oh my... well, yes. Ill take one :D
/me Dumps a dump truck full of cookies onto Nittany_Discord
I've heard how introspective Haibane Renmei can me, actually
lol Scoots
anything read in the voice of Morgan Freeman is entertaining :D
The cart riding reminds me a little bit of Super Mario RPG for a moment.
Hmm... now how does one repay a pony for a free muffin...?
00,02Sumica, that was fast
00,10yeah it was
Polydunami what anime? tell me!!:[
oni_link . . . 50 Shades of Gray

I just said it, thelonepony :P
Haibane Renmei
Sumica - ...That's what she said?
11,01Sumica: 30 seconds for what?
00,02Sumica, we are paying for the game, quick loading times is the least they can do
00,10true
I just thought of another anime; Aria the Animation
00,10queue time Nittany_Discord
Hmmm. I wonder if Scoots has Steam :/
<_> derp
which is why i don't bother with Boot Camp or Mann Up
11,01Queue for Mann Up mode?
i'll just make my own server
Polydunami: ever seen angel beats
Yep
yeah thats a really good one
YourLittleDashie: its also a twilight fanfiction gone horribly wrong
MirrorImage: MvM server?
Get chance and luck!
oni_link - well, TF2 server in general
but mostly MvM, yeah
00,02we'
MirrorImage: oooh I wanna play :3
00,02derp
Nittany_Discord whenever you try to enter a Mann Vs Machine mach, they give you an estimated time in minutes depending on how many servers are how full. It's very wrong most of the time.
don't have the server up right now
00,02we got through the queue fast, its loading slow though
Polydunami: Angel Beats :D
Unnr: Still a better love story than... wait
it's just one of the ingame servers - you see that + icon by the Server button? that's create server
i just do that
Polydunami: omg totally :D
But you know whats a MLP fanfic gone wrong?
Polydunami: The one with the pinkish hair?
Yeah
YourLittleDashie: What?
Shizuka - considering how often we got steamrolled on Advanced, i would imagine so
MirrorImage: i thought that only made a local server?
I can't remember most of their names :S
NocturnalBlade - that's what sv_lan 0 is for
AJIsAwesome: Scootaloo's Love For Pain *shudders*
Except Otonashi, I believe
what server is this?
And TK
Yay Meanwhile.
"This is all Meanwhile" *BUFFER STRIKE*
MirrorImage: you should invite me :) steamID: _oni_link_

Is there any easy DIY steam theme maker anywhere?
Oh it is
BROW = cat+dog
that was cool
superretroworld: Danke
11,01VenHur: Have you hit your limit on that card yet?

wouldn't the Bat Credit Card be a major security hole to Batman's not-so-secret identity?

Polydunami: I liked the show alot, I cried when Ushio died :(
/me glomps SuperBrony64
thats best can doo
00,02Vordox, yeah
Woooo SuperBrony64 you eat all those cookies and your gonna get a wicked bad tummy ack!
13despite volunteering for moderation of internet communities, i'm not a masochist..
Phase4: Is it the ticket stuff? Not sure I can join then
Dj_Cyber-4G what's your OC?
I didn't cry but I was near to tears when Ushio and Tomoya made up :(
Shizuka - i'm sure it's been easier since the end of season 2
i don't have one yet
Shizuka I'll keep you updated
Dj_Cyber-4G . . . OS, sorry.
00,02Vordox, you need a ticket
-_(\
Phase4: Bleh =P
YourLittleDashie: Me too. :)
13i'm pretty sure you can't trade tickets until a few days after purchase
OH im a little slow im with music but not CPUs can ya explain
13which is lame squared
i think that's how it is with all paid item Shizuka
I was able to trade a ticket after buying it, I thought I had to wait a few days.
Shizuka you can't trade anything from the store until a few days of purchase IIRC
probably to ensure against account thefts
Might of been a glitch or something.
so someone can't steal an account, drain it of money in items, then quick trade those items
what tickets are we talking about?
Polydunami: by then I was still worked up but I choked up a bit :( its the only show thats ever made me genuinly sad. It brought my innocence out. I literally thought to myself, "Wait, shes so young! Why did she die???" :'(
superretroworld - Mann Up tickets, which get you access to dedicated valve MvM servers on super hard difficulty
11,02Ponies47: Did you read mah Twitter feed? :P
oh
11,01There has to be a logical reason why you can't trade bought things to other things right away.
Nittany_Discord - someone steals your account, buys tf2 items, and quick trades them off before you can notice
Nittany_Discord: its kinda like a cool off period
with the time limit, those items have to sit there for a few days
SuperBrony64: I don't have Twitter silleh.
Welp, I gotta go guys. *blasts off to the moon*
11,01MirrorImage: That makes sense.
bai VenHur
night VenHur !
which gives you a chance to notice "hey, why did my account buy all these items" before those items get traded off
Night VenHur :)
night VenHur
11,02Ponies47: Awww :<
/me thinks he should make a twitter. one day.

>_>
00,10till busters show up
SuperBrony64: <_<
13Phase4: a protip i guess.. if you switch classes, it seems the class upgrade tab carries over, and weapons will be there if you switch back
SuperBrony64 - boy... you sound like my company's security head
11,01Should I ask people to follow me on Tumblr as well?
LMAO SB
Sumica: Bustes are easy to avoid if you place your sentries wisely.
lol, SB
Wait MASF123|afk why did they block you and how do you know?
11,02Nittany_Discord: NO :<
11,01Aww :<
it's funny, about once a month we get a company wide email showing us an example of a phishing email that someone in the company has gotten
I was JUSt watching toby when i saw this comment:
I thought you'd never know if somepony blocked you :S
the brilliant thing, though, is that the guy simply FORWARDS the phishing email, makes a note that "the links have viruses" and fails to remove said links
Nittany_Discord: Tumblr eh?
evidently we've had a handful of computers infected that way through second-hand stupidity <_<
Comment said: HEY TOBY GUESS THE FUCK WAT MY SON HAS CANCER BC OF U AND UR IDIOTICNESS AND HE SWORE AT SCHOOL BC OF U. I DEMAND U TAKE DOWN UR VIDZ AND I WILL KILL U IF U DONT.

Dark_Horst I never got into portables until the DSi, but even then I wasn't crazy about it.
Nowadays, I'm left with a solitary PC, which can emulate the PSX and, to varying success, N64

Dark_Horst nnope. My parents never bought me a portable and I never asked, until the DSi of course. Main reason was because portables were Pokemon from what I knew and I was never into it.

wha? he even has a virtual boy
Canadian_Brony Oh yeah, Starfox 64 wasn't the first
PuddingCupz, he's a troll.
Ihave an xbox 360 that I only used for FFXI Online while I played that-- and now only as a DVD player. No ther games ever came out that really caught me. Oh, and I won it... one of the first ones.
Canadian_Brony well the one on the N64 is more of a remake
twilight_sprinkle Dark_Horst that is a very shitty 3D gaming headset. "Virtual Boy"
11,01Virtual Boy. Ooh.
Intoooooooo virtual reality we go
SuperBrony64: okay... what DON'T you have?
Star Fox was first at the SNES. There was even a sequel that was never released
it was baaaaaaaaad
Canadian_Brony: ah k, thx
Virtual Boy. Jeez man!
Is that a virtual boy?
There is NOTHING to be proud of about the Virtual Boy.
My stream is stuck
the power glove, its so..baaaad
that was inspiration for the 3DS
Why do you own two!?
twilight_sprinkle LoLz IKR?
11,02Virtual Boy, $3 w/ VB Wario Land and Controller at Flea Market :)
SuperBrony64 must shit golden bricks to have these
Wait

Why does he even own ONE?
SuperBrony64
how are the games SuperBrony64?

i should go to fleamarkets more often
Kencolt he's a collector
11,02MASF123: Refresh embed
Kencolt Canadian_Brony My thoughts exactly!
sb must live in yard sale land or something
Amazing. We first got the Virtual Boy, which supposively did 3D. This gen, however, we can see 3D without the use of glasses
Ohhh we get scolling text now ^_^
Genesis and 32X IIRC
oh a 32x
are we getting a new pony ep soon?
So... he has the 32x, but not a Sega CD?
Wario Land and Teknoboxer, the only good VB games
XylemTube probably, haven't heard any newsof it
Next episode air time in unknown
SuperBrony64: do u shit bricks?
XylemTube a relese date for Season 3 has not yet been confirmed.
11,02O.o
XylemTube: if youre referring to the running text, i think it was never changed
isn't the 32x useless without a sega cd?
XylemTube Nothing official, but I'd wager not more than a few months
"Anything you can do I can do better. Bitch."
Im still looking forward too it :)
Maybe tomorrow
Suprised Tom didn't come up on that. Must be turned off at the moment

i like white chocolate only in small amounts, i get tired of it fast

What the hell is a Care Bear?
Here's what it really boils down to: I don't think that the Barbies can ever have as much character depth as the Ponies.
11,02Sorry, trying to swap the stream embed
it doesn't matter about character depth and all that shit
it's about the joke going too far like it did with ponies
Eddmario: you rule breaker :P but anyway dat one-winged angel
Barbies are humans, and nobody likes humans. :/
Eddmario: for that attempt alone you deserve to rot in a ditch
lol
true
MASF123: well humans suck
MASF123 except lyra
MASF123: humans shoul all die
and if this barbros thing lasts too long there's going to be terror abounding
Dark_Horst that was quite dark.
Buytoast: People came for the 4chan flame wars. They stayed for my little ponies :3
/me is drinking Beer
Idk, no need to argue I guess. I'm just more optimistic, you're not. That's okay ;D
well the flames may rise again
I don't like our species I would much rather be a talking pony, an alien with badass powers, or an andriod/robot with an arsenal of weapons.
MASF123: i was contemplating to write die instead of rot

Random Dumori triva: My Great Uncle ran Opal mines (and gold) in Austrailia
Lol.
11,02Nittany_Discord: So funny :D
13so protip
13mann up mode
13is BS
00,02if breaks easy
13don't waste your money
00,10did't get a fucking thing
00,02Shizuka, you'll notice your ticket wasnt consumed
13it was
00,10and tickets not used either
an Duck and Cover? Nittany_Discord?
11,01Shizuka: Why?
00,02Shizuka, it was?
13yep
00,02check
11,02Here, I'll play the Volcano episode for you Nittany_Discord :)
13and only one hat
Duck and Cover
00,02why was yours consumed and not mine?
00,10still got all mine Phase4
11,01SuperBrony64: Could have played it after this.
13because i got an item
00,10cause we did't get items Phase4
00,02that seems broken
00,02very broken
13yep
00,02and the squad surplus tickets did nothing
11,01Phase4: Did you not finish the match?
13so yeah don't bother with mann up... do yourself a favor and spend that $0.99 on a name tag
The South Park game was bad, but funny
00,10we finished the match
11,02The Nintendo 64 version was cool :)
Is this Mann VS Machine anygood?
00,10the mann up items did work
00,10the squad item worked
11,02I wonder if the one on the Xbox 360 is cool o.o
00,02yeah, not worth the money
00,10but we did not get charged them
The PS version got a way lower score too
I played the N64 version though
00,10my voucher is still there and they all got 2 items
13i only got one
Sumica: I got 1 only
13we all only got one
Anyway....
13plus a badge for the mann up mode
Only 4 of us
You mean the LoTR South Park game?
00,02i dont understand how thats suposed to work
Good night! :)
Phase4: Check forums
It's coming right for us!
00,02midway steam dc'd somehow
Shizuka Phase4 Sumica: Tell me if you need a Demoman again
Without ticket =P
11,02MASF123: IKR :D
Sumica ouch really?
Sweeet
00,10wel its more then I got Vordox
Your gonna spill yer beer.
11,01Shizuka: If you got an item in Mann Up mode, then there was no glitch (I think).
Sumica: Yeah I saw it
Lol Cartman.
11,01Lol.
Oh hello Shizuka! :)
13yes but there were two squad surplus vouchers active
!!!
Shizuka: Check forus
coudl be item sever laf
lag
11,01Shizuka: You lost two tickets?
cos that stuff is silly
/me 11,01explodes
Awww cute bunny. :)
00,02Nittany_Discord, didnt lose them
could be, i didnt get an item from last night till about half an hour sitting in the tf2 homescreen
00,10Phase4, did you get DCed at some point?
It's coming right for us!
00,02i didnt notice it but aparently yeah
Nittany_Discord: For scout do you have critic cola or sandman if you do would you like to trade for them I'm really looking for those
13if you are playing a map you already completed for a certain tour, you don't get loot and keep your ticket
13you have to finish the other maps in the tour
....:O
Sumica: You had some internet issue on the last waves too
wave*
00,10not last wave
00,10but yes
13from steam forum
00,10fucking lame
13Surplus gives everyone 1 extra loot
You did to me, you just stood still for well over 10 seconds on the first wave of the last round
13You only get loot if you played the FULL game from the START on a map you HAVE NOT won.
13
13Join 1 second too late and you get no loot, you dont lose vouchers though
Wow Stan's Dad.
11,01cow334: I did have two spare Crit-a-colas, but I crafted them :<
Oh mah gawd! :O
aw man
/me sips coffee
13so yeah
11,01I can check tomorrow if I have another.
13phase's server from now on
13don't waste your money
00,02^
I only got a wrap assassin
Shizuka: I'M GOING TO BUY YOU A TICKET.
Nittany_Discord: What about sandman
(Which I already have 1 or more of)
11,01Don't have a sandman at all.
http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dumorimasoddaa/games?tab=all
/me is bored yet all these games I have
LMAO
13if you're going to spend $0.99 on me get me a name tag >>
phases servers are awesome
OKAY. I WILL.
00,10and oddly enough we get "engien block" acheavment
X3
Goddamn it Ned
I don't need to spend to name tag
Nittany_Discord: oh okay then but what would you want for the critic cola if you do have one
I have 4 sitting in my backpack
13i'm betting that's because the waves we won we never let them get that far
13when they did get that far, they always capped
That's like...almost a dollar.
11,01cow334: What do you have?
11,02DUN DUN DUN DUN DUUUUUUN
Totally screwed
time to burn through the 6 tickets i already have then if it was that bad Shizuka
11,01I wonder if the VEI was out by then.
13sure it was hard but
13meh
Nittany_Discord: I have a lot of stuff actualy i'll give you any thing for the critic cola
Shizuka: Wasn't SO hard.
10 medics + 10 heavies vs 1 Demo = Nope
13it was more luck
11,01So, that means their mountain is as "Explosive" as Yellowstone.
13so long as the wrong people didn't die at the wrong time, we handled it easy
Go Kenny!
XD Damnit Kenny
11,01Which could cause global catastrophe.
Shizuka: Yeah we had some nice run, no doubt
The Legend of Scuzzlebutt
Morning, everypony.

11,01Who is Patrick Duffy?
Step by step, day by day.
<3
Some guys in Step by Step
11,01I do remember that sitcom though I never watched it.
Some guy
00,10no I know why we got it Shizuka, just shocked that we got it on the last wave
00,10with all the tanks and such
13oh
Oh my God. :D
00,10cause so many tanks
kum by ya
11,02Kumbaya
11,01Are Mann Up matches harder on equal missions than normal?
13the best tank got as far as the last mineshaft but the bomb was still behind the corner at that point
13somewhere in there it seemed to have reset itself before the final tank
We should all have a campfire on Bronystate with all the bronies singing Kumbayay
shana: Name tag? I found a descrption tag! Is that what you want?
I'm going to be bying a ticket for mann up I want to try it
woot woot ^^
