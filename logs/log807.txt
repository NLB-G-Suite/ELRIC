OOH who dat lady?
Van Canto (sometimes stylized as van Canto) is a German a cappella metal band, founded in 2006 and composed of five singers and a drummer. Although the group is often classified as an a cappella ensemble, they use real drums in their music, instead of vocal percussion or beatboxing.
hmm
well, this one not som metal
This is Van Canto - last night of the kings
a cappella, that means with dubstep, right?
Van Canto play a cappella with classic heavy, power and symphonic metal influence, creating what they call "hero metal a capella".
Wonderbolt Academy is on youtube

Get adblock plus
AdBlock ^
Sorry matmaq2

They are there FOREVER O_O

You need Chrome then

thats why crome is best
lol
chrome is slow for me for some reasn
have you heard of metallica wrek?
i found a pretty nice addblocker for firefox
can we watch a nickback concert?
BlitzMcKrieg how about NO
you crazy dutch ******
If we're watching metal, we need to take aa few minutes for an A7x song
so whats going on here, what we watching
Rattletrap: what are you using?
wrek have you heard of metallica?
Oy, not all us dutch people eat our own skinflakes Chrysalis.
05aye
that opening...those goosebumps oAo
he is my only example of dutch
cool can we have a metallica song on next?
Hai Guys
05but
05avantasia!
05:o
meh
hey
No, A7x!
how've you been DitzyDerpy
sure you can have avantasia first
Fine how about you?
hey Wrek you like slyer?
hi DitzyDerpy
im back
05I like everyoen Dr. Reed.
i'm good DitzyDerp15 do you know who won the lottery?
i love learning about new rock bands im a rock and roll kid
all cool bands have singers with aviators
im excited about new epiode im playing Roblox MLP: FiM Roleplay lolol
05fyi
05there are a shit ton of famous musicians in this project band
05all lead by the lead singer of Edguy
such as?
05such as..
sorry but rock band fact comeing up
It's kind of funny how only 134 outta 3236 people are watching the stream
05acts 	Edguy, Helloween, Gamma Ray, Andre Matos, At Vance, Magnum, Stratovarius, Rhapsody Of Fire, Virgin Steele, Within Temptation, Impellitteri, Masterplan, Aina, Symphony X, Scorpions, Kiss, Kamelot, Epica, Revolution Renaissance, Place Vendome, Savatage, Jon Oliva's Pain, Yngwie Malmsteen, Heavens Gate
yoyoyo
did you know motar head is the loudest band in the world?
those awesome bands~
when i say by loud
Yea Avantasia and Ayreon always invite shitloads of other metal players for their albums.
Wow...that's actually an impressive list.
i mean so loud your ears bleed and you cant hear for days lol
what about korpiklaani?
project band?
Actually, I thought Man O War held the record for loudest...
no it is motar head
didnt they call that metallica once?
05this is classed as symphonic power metal
it could be heard for 6 miles in the 9090s
05and IIII LOVE IT
Will we be playing any Turbonegro?
symphonic metal is <3
best metal
Metal is metal in my eyes...these demi-genres need to get over themselves.
will there be a metallica song like master of puppet?
sooooo
yes?
05brony655321: powermetal is so different from say dethcore metal
play some blind guardian next
I'm pretty sure it goes to the Sovjet military. A 50MT nuclear warhead on pointblank range is probably the loudest manmade sound ever made.
saying metal is metal is pretty damn stupid
Symphonic from plain Heavy
05best song
Play some Avenged Sevenfold next
05is this one
Yeah I know. But still...it's ridiculous how many there are for any musical genre.
you cant simply put two completely different styles of music in the smae genre
i know two rock bands
metallica and motarhead
and i love there albums
Music is too huge to just have specific main genres
Play I Got A Knife by Turbonegro. It has deep lyrics
moonslicer: Motorhead by the way.
Its the same way that both humans and snails are mammalia yet are completely different.
sorry lol
Snails aren't mammals though...
moonslicer: it's cool. They are awesome.
everything is connected in ways we couldnt imagian ralathon
what!? a add!?
the singer dresses like bret michaels
oh well its gone
Lol, I don't get ads
05look into adblock
There is no shame in adblock
i get them on every single of my fav videos
adblock is your friend
like google
adblock and you are meant to be
Kvelertak. Might it be played?

I'm gonna go crash for a few hours before new episode. So good night and Wrek thanks for the music as always
Same. I'm out
I actually do understand the difference between black and power metal, but then it gets into "death-black metal" and "symphonic-power-math-metal" and that's where it gets ridiculous.
not tht anyone cares...
i got me some cut up apples and 2 oranges here ha ha whoooo!
05tehres power metal
05and symphonic power metal
05once utnilises a shitload more say keyboards
Power math metal? y=x^metal?

05CTHULHU; too bad
Meshuggah is considered "math-metal"
Play some Avenged Sevenfold
sikth is math metal

I wonder if Wrek ever heard about Hevisaurus.

05i probably have
so Wrek have you heard of killswitch engange
You will be surprised.

We lurk in the shadows, waiting to steal the souls of the unsuspecting
we lurk and lurk and lurk
Well, hello everyone.
Applesack... run. It`s more fun when it`s a challenge
Is it still true that Nico from Iron Maiden holds a bass drum record?
XD
05no really was it just me or was CTHULHU a giant douche?
He was
agreed
ginormous douche
A challenge?
he rbave
why he says its a shame to take the german flag o0
Wrek, Just another person failing at trolling or was just upset because no ponies up on stream
/me shrug
why does he have a french flag?
Pwny: we germans arent allowed to show our flag. people seemt o be scared of it
Applesack, it`ll be more fun to steal your soul if I have to chase you down for it
Alrighty them.
then*
Wrek, typical entitled dude that doesn't know that a browser can have multiple tabs open.
if you're german, and dare show a hint of patriotism, everybody suddenly sees a nazi
05which is silly
japan is like that too
Very silly
If my mustache and beard colors were switched, I could potentially grow the flag of Germany on my face ._. huge joke in my circle of friends
That is true...first thing we thing of considering Germans is Nazi. Then food.
Brats and whatnot.
I think beer first when I think Germans >_>
Indeed, Nazi wouldn't use any German flag with yellow color.
WURST UND BIER< na ja... ;)

Wrek, he is asking
Not demanding
and of course the bronies are asking for furry...
Wrek can you place your body onto me?

YOU HAVE KILLED MY FATHER, PREPARE TO DIE!
AdamTheDuck: I hear the Pinkie Pie card box comes out today, Target exclusive - Hot Topic has a Vinyl Scratch box released today as well, not sure I can hit both today, nearest first
Because reasons.
Ralathon so he can hit him better
He shrink so that its easier to hit him
He wants Jack to die by his sword.
g
He is huge, you don't need to aim when you're big...
is that why hes trying to laser beam him to death ?
But the sword is tiny Ralathon..
If I find 'em, Im getting at least 2

No shit it aint dubstep it's so obvious...
This kind of trance, isn't it?
Soras, god damn
Only if you are Lawful good
escapistPinkamena: oh, ok :)
Dubstep has breakbeats.
It's mainly Techno for this..
if you think this is dubstep you got a massive problem
Now if you were Chaotic Evil...it ok
DAT HAIR
Stupid kids calling all musics dubstep nowadays
its pretty much like the story of the pied piper in this episode right?
Soras: THIS IS TECHNO
Dubstep sounds like a blown speaker.
kids dont know what the jazz is all about
Talin Lawful evil?
ааааааа
why does he have a problem ? not knowing is not a crime
clearly aku will destroy the world with music!
Let's say the true truth.
That was EDM.
Dubstep is aggressive.... Techno has lots of good Beat
badass
NEW QUEST: SAVE EVERYONE
Eh, genres. The only type of music I like is the ones I like listening to.
You all defend me not giving a crap about dubstep and not about how all that new music is the evil that is rotting society? Shame!
I'll stick with Classic Rock, thanks. :P
There's no way to deny that was EDM.
Aku for s3 end villain

How is it rotting society?

hi sacksy.
otakon: it hurts rainbow dashes ego
those dolls are posessed by demons
fluttercry: dude you okay?
Other pony seems more arrogant than RD though, so is probaby in more need of humility
^
Bronysith: yeah true but it's a bit different
Bjornfot: the demons are possesed by those dolls
At least we haven't seen any [REDAKTED] ads so far.

Kammerjunk: MMO with lighter themes and stricter restrictions conerning behaviour. Wizard and Pirate 101 I would like to try at least once
05,15Rainbow Dash got humbled

Kammerjunk, clever marketing?
Are you ready for this? MYRIAD TRUTHS
can we get a pressdough thats not for kids?
have an adult bake them?
where's the fun in that
What's wrong with an adult bake?
otakon: I don't know, I know at least WoW has an age rating of 12+. Doesn't get a lot younger while still being able to understand what's going on.
AttackWithHugs: not as good as chicken bake
and a gender neutral easy bake oven
WAAAAH I WANNA BE HEAD
get you crap in gear
otakon: Or steak bake
suddenly getting vorkosigan vibes from this
Kammerjunk: well WoW is also filled with the jaded and most anal of gamers too due to it's age

BLASPHEMY
05,15Also, Lightening Dust X Rainbow Dash fics

fluttercry: and r34 pics, dont worry ill send them to you
your body obviously isn't ready.
fluttercry, so. Since you hate RD so much, opinion on Lightning Dust?
Phase4: reasonable? More like PANSY
lol this commercial
how to tell your parents that you are a brony
I almost loved Lightning Dust. then she was a cuntbag.
05,15I don't like her
hahah
fluttercry: yeah true but it still doesn't mean that they are not records for best time regardless
Kawaii_icybeauti: lol
Quorl: WHO ARE YOU?

Phase4: it's time for a change in phone plan.

Phase4: Moshi Monsters, duh
fluttercry: There's more porn of lightning x spitfire than lightning x rainbow

Well that was a bad episode
Bronysith: dude calm yourself
poor Pinkie
So guys. i'd have to say that this episode is...

DSNesmith, are you not watching?
fluttercry: Because it was blatantly obvious that it -was- going there.
http://static.tumblr.com/gdvenyy/WPrm200zv/arnbo_dish_clear.png wundahbelts pls
Really, adding that kind of character drama wouldn't work for a series like this at ALL.
Solid 9/10. Was good.
I loved it.
I give it an 8/10
everyone is abandoning ship.
05,15But why did it HAVE to go there? It would have been interesting to see how they would have handled her leaving the wonderbolts dream and learning that sometimes you have to give up a dream
k I have to go find spitfire/LD pi- STUDY FOR FINALS
lots of studying
Boooo/10
night all.
Eh, never mind, I'm not going to discuss fan interpretations of the new episode. I'll just enjoy it on its own merits. :P
8/10 before Rarity hugging.... 5/10 after
sometimes on internet
All that __x__ has quit on main chat
Damn it, Hasbro =_(\
XD
RaveBrony, oh come on. Don't let the fandom get to you. Admit that scene was cute.
DSNesmith: Hah. You're not going anywhere and you know it.

OMG RINA CHAN HS SCH A SCKSEE VOISS <3 <3 <3
That was my impression of mane chat.
ufff
I really don't want to study quantum mechanics
OH NO RARITY HUGGED THUNDERLANE AFTER HE SAVED HER LIFE FUCKING HASBRO ENCOURAGING SHIPPING OH MY GOOOOOOOOD.
Man, she made brawl taunts and nin10doh,my childhood.
Ninjazz: I took it as cute, I mean come on. He did save her. But this fandom and the sickness that plagues a big deal of it :[
Kawaii_icybeauti: how weird eh? :D
05,15Soooo. Does RD stay at the academy for future episodes now?
fluttercry: dont think any1 knows
oh, is this the pissed panda episode?
fluttercry: no title or synopsis has been released for episode 8, so who knows.

RaveBrony, see man. That's not a good way to deal with things. Look at me, I nearly popped a fuse when Trixie was on screen but that was CANON. This time it was just a hug for saving someone's life. Nothing OBVIOUS about that.
wait, people got mad because rarity hugged thunderlane?
i missed something lol
valoreins|Drawing: not mad, worried about the possible shipping
OH GOD THE SHIPPING
correction. there was a synopsis released for episode 8. muh derp.
FEDEX IS COMING!
nah, it's the nature of shipping
Everyone is just going to take that hug the wrong way. Instead of a thnk you hug it becomes a shipping hug -.-

oh God
Probably tomato
05,15......
05,15OH BOY
Or a good tomato, basil pesto.
well THAT quote won't be abusable
Because tomato sauce is HARD to get out of clothes
"they brought back pegasi that had featured in an earlier episode? FAAAAANSERVIIIIIIICE"
HE IS BOLD BIGFLANK!
AttackWithHugs, lol.
05,15That quote can't be twisted at all
some olive oil and garlic with the spaghetti would be nice.

You know, if you don't mind.

It only got asked. Not answered.
It's still being ignored.
MINTY :D
Ninjazz: You can't ignore his girth.
You are a MONSTER. Good work, Scoots.
inb4 she accidentally enters an RP chat.
What did Scoots do?
Kammerjunk, I've tried.

05,15One time I lost a bet, and I had to either stand in a fountain in a busy street, or talk to a girl

Nope. Time to for shameless pluuuuuugs.

05,15but....that's hard
Got a girl to come join you in the fountain
^
i would talk to someone standing in a fountain
05,15DAMMIT WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT

^
That will never fail to work
"you have a beard and you're kinda fat"
bronies, ladies and gents
OK :c
No. This is not bronies. This is spaghetti.
05,15beard, but all of it is located in the neck area
Spaghetti has been in the wild before brony neck beards.
DSNesmith: I can't grow a beard and I swim :( I'm not a true brony
nothing better than goofing around with a toy lightsaber
Hahahaha
05,15This should probably wrap up soon
:o
We can so see what's going on.
Ninjazz: The brony fandom has caused the largest influx of Italian food the world has ever seen.
We are so entertained.
they're just talking about random shit
Bronycon is more or less just a great big ragu factory.
I don't know, I kinda like italian food.
Especially the deserts.
And enough tomato sauce to drown all of the East Coast, ScootaChicken.
sleep time
night Phase4
night
I really want to go to Bronycon next year just to see exactly how awkward it is.
Animaniacs Marathon! :o
ScootaChicken: not worth it
I also wanna go so I can ship Saxy x Twilight NASA 4 life.
NASA? wut
wow
wooooow
O_o
glad to see I was wrong
You know. I'm torn.
05,15We can carry tomato sauce and bowls of spaghetti and give them to random people
I guess it's just because Denmark is so small, but every time I've been at a meetup, we just did a marathon and ate McDonalds. No singing, no raiding Toys'R'Us, just watching ponies in a rented room.
Oh, and D&D.
/me still doesn't get the spaghetti thing
this lady's voice
she's best pony and has dat voice
I think I broke Anneli
Applepiiiieeeee
Anneli: If you wanan do cons, then come to Singapore! We have.... n-no conventions... but we do have a community! :D

05,15k
Yes! Do that!

Come to Universal Studios Hollywood then. I work there now :P
dont come to the netherlands we dont have anything and the weather sucks
"Soarin's Applepiiiiiie~" ...If you excuse me I have to go change my pants... :$
D:
Disneyland, Sea World, Universal Studios... USA has the best theme parks :(
I live away from all of the US. I have little to no pasta around me. I know this is a blessing in disguise but I kinda want to see just much alfredo sauce can be made from a brony meat up.
Question to all: How much pony stuff do you own?
East coast FTW
lol
fluttercry: >give them
was "meat up" a pun
Lawl, I'm gonna throw it at them whether they like it or not.
