08,01Liokin: i like it that its PG in here, actually
08,01some of the mods, certainly
08,01some like to keep ponies innocent
08,01most, actually
08,01anyway, there are other channels for talking about sexytimes
all the sexytimes
08,01like #stupidsexytwilight, which i made when for when i wanted to talk about sex and sexuality without polluting this channel
but yeah saturn like I was saying
its just that it seens some rules censor the fun of things
08,01Liokin: did you see my above posts?
08,01some like to keep ponies innocent

08,01ah
08,01Atler_Tempest: exactly. itd be like #brony, which is a horrible place
08,01its much more light hearted and fun in here
08,01indeed
08,01i mean, its a matter of freedoms
and no one talks about /b/... <_< >_>
08,01freedom to and freedom from
yep..
Gore
Comedics beyond standard
nudity
08,01we lose the freedom to, say, come in and start complaining about our sex lives in great detail
night everypony its 4am for me..and sleep is needed
08,01but we gain freedom from some associated natiness that comes in large unregulated chats
08,01so this means keeping it pg
fly
:)
08,01we wouldnt want to scare people off
yeah, if someones not enjoying because of me, then i'm not enjoying.
ok back AGAIN
i dont mind any of the adult material, but i wont bring it to this channel...
lol
:D

00,02shana, decompilation
00,02shana, not sure how to contact the orignal author
08,01Phase4: carrier pigeon
00,02havent found anything from him/her newer than 2003 and they're japanese
00,02Saturn, that could work
08,01i want some food
then go feed
00,02shana, i'm not sure of the legality of it but theres a few things i could definantly release
08,01for reasons i shant go into
00,02eg: utf-8 encoded resources
00,02not entirely sure how java handles missing classes
00,02i imagine its an exception thrown when you try to instance it
00,02i'ma assume that cause it makes this simpler
missing classes is rather rare oO
08,01thats more or less correct
08,01afair
08,01Liokin: ukofequestris.co.uk

Whoa my dropbox was upgraded to 52.8 GB for setting it up on my SIII :O

00,02oni_link, Dat quota
00,02hmmm
Saturn: UK is all you've got huh?

oh whoa
that looks like it's ignoring that protocol is file oO
00,02it is
00,02its trying to interpret it as an ftp protocol
00,02if it doesnt have a host it interprets it as ftp iirc
00,02wait

lol
soo AMUSING
I'm afraid I must take off folks. I'll be back shortly.
Figures.
Yawn
00,02shana, no way to set hostname
00,02i did it manualy via the debugger, now it seems to be stuck somewhere
unless you probally hack it XD
http://trollfacecomic.com/post/5770023211/troll-comics-usb-troll-rageguycomic-rage
00,02that seems to have worked
00,02now its deadlocked
random
00,02huh
00,02Meanwhile, debug something
00,02shana, it *worked* but it dies elsewhere now
no
lol
00,02might have to over-ride getCodeBase
00,02urgh
00,021am
There was something I found quite perplexing - that WE (some scientists) have declared mathematics as the universal language - think about that for a moment :)
00,02sleep/code/game?
No/No/Yes.
applejack096:You Cannot Go Alone Take This With You.*gives a tiny fluttershy*
00,02TheRandomkid321, utc+10 bro's /)
we use it, we define it
Uhh yeah.. (\
k
00,02checking
ok pluto
00,02hmmm
00,02too early
hm never had such a deadlock
00,02need to check that deadlock if you use too early
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAKaym1gx3I&feature=bf_next&list=LLPAvCXct1pg-6eaOAgJ3flg
=P
00,02shana, url has the authority and host bit
How can we truly confirm math as a Universal language based on studies on this single planet?
00,02probably
applejack096:i dont know XD
lollllollllipop!!!!!
wat mini fluttershy?
Plz
lol
someone put decent music on plz
08,01i beg to differ
I beg you do not share anyone elses name.
00,02the crap is going on
00,02shana, from pframe
08,01im not
08,01all you need to do is join the channel anyway
though, they didn't mention bio weaponry...or at least I missed that part - give the aliens a cold
00,02shana, it has a custom getCodeBase /)_-
though not everyone in that channel is involed
00,02how insanely strange
GO GO PONY RANGERS
08,01actually, the channels mainly just for talking about sex and sexuality
00,02shana, i change the string litteral from file:// to file:/ and it seems to work
08,01but rp orgies sometimes happen
oO
00,02shana, AppletWatcher.java
You're not helping.
00,02its a custom applet viewer
BY JAVA
XD
*hate
00,02stupid codebase
00,02too large and obfuscated and confusing and java does not help
Hi everypony.
00,02all fixed now
hello :3
08,01this isnt the place to discuss that anyway
Meh.
derp
Java applets?
08,01paradoxically, SST is...
GO GO PONY RANGERS
Need to go. Night be back later. Bye everypony.
It... REALLY pains me to vote on rage comics... But someones gotta do it.
00,02shana, yes
Turtles.
ahh cool you guys to version control
00,02Vordox, i dont know
XD
yes
00,02thats fixed
00,02look at deadlock or sleep...
00,02quick look at deadlock
Phase4:what are you debugging for?
00,02sonicandmario85, paintchat
he's trying to fix paintchat
00,02Bluestrom_S, tortise svn and tortise git
i tried going there but it whould just load and not go there
00,02as for the actual version, nearly latest but i cbf downloading the update
cool
00,02dont realy like it anyway, git > tortise git
tortoise svn in pretty awesome
they come with the standard git distribution
pretty awesome toolset
http://bronysith.deviantart.com/art/chocolate-dipped-potato-crisps-312580317
00,02shana, yes but it cant accept passwords via the terminal
00,02tbh if i'm in a position where i need a gui, i'm pushing to a bitbucket or github repo
00,02so i can just use the websites
00,02inb4 i'm in that position and internets not avaliable
KRBALS
KERBALS*
00,02sonicandmario85, that they are
00,02i'll explode them soon :P
java?
it's very clean and fast. Not sure if it works with non github repos though.
/me 00,02think he;s found the deadlock
or was it floating point seconds..
00,02Funkballs, it should work with any git repo, github does nothing spesific
I think it'
00,02shana, in miliseconds, theres probably a float overload though
there's Thread.wait for that
00,02and just like that
00,02the deadlock is gone
00,02and i did nothing
00,02[buy some apples] you java
Phase4:whats paintchat for? can you paint pictures or something on it?
00,02i stand by my opinion that there is a way to do java wel
00,02well'
00,02but that sun decided not to do that and oracle is not gona help
That was mildly peculiar...
lol
00,02http://www.bronystate.net/paintchat/
No... My computer settings reset randomly?
00,02shana, yeah, but to be fair the language is prety much assembler for the bytecode
^_^
Just a moment guys.
javavm is probably the fastest vm there is..
00,02fun fact: the server is running here at my hose
Wait its good
00,02they just spent a LOT of money making hotspot fast
00,02same amount of effort on .net would yield more results
00,02suddenly clients
00,02shana, mono is about as fast as it anyway
00,02about to exceed it
brb
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azmASqYPNc
In case you wish to see it.
THAT is the speed I want to draw...or program, or anything
Okay back
Ok. :)
that's kinda surprising. I woulda thought the overhead from the JVM would make JAVA slower than that
lower down the list
All you need is love....Hum hum humh...Isn't that one of the Beatles?
00,02shana, that benchmark is very impractical
00,02for java that is
00,02Vordox, yup
daw
<3
WAIT
00,02not objects
i didnt want that heart
Dat kick
00,02in practice you create a lot of objects, and all objects in java are heap alocated
00,02gc pauses get out of hand real fast
I SAW THE KERBALS THEY ARE GETTING WORSE!
But THAT'S how fast I want to program. XD
Skill level : ASIAN!
THEY ARE DESTROYING HIS FILES D:
:O
hai
Daaaaaaamn.
WOAH
looks at him go
:O:O
ASIAN
IMPOSSIBLE!
just kidding
asians
Now play an actual piano.
Seriously, I bet on a real piano he'd be fantastic.
00,02Vordox, his hands are made of speed
IMPOSSIBRU
cool:)
wait okay i got it
Seriously...
LOOOOOOOOOOL!
Look at this SCORE
He ranked THIRD! XD
DAT SCOORE!
asian? more like japanese
00,02Vordox, thats a heck of a thought
Still I want to see you program that fast someday :P
Make it happen!
00,02wish i could
he's good
00,02programings not realy about typing though
needs more tableflipping
please
plox
00,02cow334, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azmASqYPNc

00,02shana, dats the plan :)
/me nods

Vordox:yes
Oh.
Dem finger control...
00,02shana, right now i'm thinking of adding websockets to its webserver
00,02along with replacing its webserver
Good music....

Now see that's Newfoals can't Triforce.
I don't like, dowanload 360 games and burn them in cds then play them on a modded xbox 360
also there are tons more libraries for python
Python is nice as it teaches you good tabbing habits
00,02Straisin, c++ is probably not where you want to start
can I post link to song I made?
Java is nice to start out too
I got some good finds today :)
00,02do a bit in an easier language, once you have the basic concepts you can start c++
