Wow I missed all of that because of an ad
11,01Just saying your name.
DONE!:)
Irish_Pony: Because I've SEEN 2001. And I get it.
Irish, because it's a parody of a movie
hiya Tom
Easily one of the best fanworks I've ever seen.
Cuz we saw the original movie... All our derps 6_9 were expressed on it
Because most of us have seen 2001 and know the story'
Lots of talent around here.
Marx: agreed
Nittany_Discord ooki doki loki
Definitely 10/10.

It dragged on too long in several places.
8 memes / 10, the middle is weak
Impressive, but I thought the first one was funnier
Seriously, funny and referential and even TRUMPS The first in terms of quality
Coulda trimmed 20 minutes without losing a single joke

Dark_Horst: at the end
well I think this was about all we could expect for a sequel
я машина
I actually lold so 9/10 for dragging onparts
I liked 2001: a pony oddysey, but its a bit to long for the collection
)))
the first was definitely a bit more concentrated awesome
Dark_Horst: the end
So... Does a Harmony Analyst deal with music or friendship??? :$

All right, I need to take off for the night folks. Night!
wicked: I HATE MUSIC
Night, Everlasting_Joy
Love this song... and I hate rap
This opening is the cream on a cake made of chocolate and strawberries.
Saints Row B*yay*s! :p
Hey we watched the first earlier today! :d
the one that started it all
Pale_Horse: and then all of a sudden its AMV Hell 3
OH GOD IT WAS LOUD
gnight Everlasting_Joy! sleep well and take care!
yep. the opening alone is one of the best pony vids made
11,01This song was around before SR3.
Always remember this from Saints Row 3
YOU ALL NEED SLEEP
...Too bad it doesnt exist.
Because its a clean rap that doesn't burn your ears.
What is this?

Eh I liked the opening for the second better
Ponies47: I guess I'm weak then
My Little Jackass

Theoretically - purely theoretically - if I wanted to, say, overthrow Celestia, how would I go about it exactly?
What is this thing you call "sleep?"
I must now go sleep so long
I'm gonna go to bed now, good seeing you all again everypony
00,10I dont sleep I just keep my bed from drifting away for extended periods of time.

What movie was that based off of?
pinkie pi, clever
00,10This video is why I am a brony
I haven't seen Shoop Da Whoop in years.
razzle dazzle
You use your grandma's electricity! :O
I'm surprised that not a single shoop made it into the sequel
richfiles: See, last time I made a circle where pi=3, it warped space-time. I was pulling things out from the future, the past, and both at once.
Sumica: not me but damn close
My wireless gives out a lot for maintenance
Reikim = :O
yhere was several tassa
00,10Youtube recomended this video to me cause I watched AMV hell
Reikim: You can make a circle with pi equal to 3. Just not in Euclidian space.
I'm a brony for lots a reasons. This video is only a small part :)
Oh god no
HA
BEES
00,10after i watched this twice I went and looked up ep one
AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH
Sumica: sounds about right
AAHABABAHA
hen3ry: That's exactly what I had to do to make it. It was awkward, to say the least.
BEES
weebl's stuff
Now we need narwhals
Lots of shoving in MLP

TASTE THE PAINBOW
hey fire twilight:)
I was in high chool when that came out...
Sumica: I suspect a LOT of people fell into our trap like that-- you watch something like this and figure, "Well, heck-- I need to find out what this is ABOUT."
XD
BAAWWT

So
What are we doing?
well bye guys.
What?

Actually, we just watched saw, and my sister sugested MLP as a way to change the tone xD
I've always wondered... who's OC is that in the corner?
YAY

00,10Well I had been seeing it pop up all over the place for the better part of 6 months

What is this clip from?
Jut looked at the Spitfire comic... Wildfire... Spitfire... Geez! What are these ponies made of? Fe2O3 and 2Al???
SpadeMagnes[R]: LotR
My friend was a brony. I thought him odd for watching MLP but he always has his reasons for everything. Watched it became a brony after I found out what a brony was
what the fuck
Galadrial freaks out
;)
00,10SpadeMagnes[R], it's from lord of the rings
Kill it with the sun
MahBoi777: Can't complain. Trying to learn Java, and it's hard...
Rarity deserved id
it
Rarity was awful in that episode.
First Step into Bronyhood: Denial.
Dr_Fumbles: first programming language?
who who
WOOO HOO HOO HOO HOO
Dr_Fumbles: ah, well good!
whoooooo are you
this is funny:D
00,10all I know about java is I dont like the taste of it.
Yep, I am also trying C#
awww....
First step into Bronyhood is watching an episode and wondering why people like this so much.
can't say i'm fond of Java either, but i can BS my way through it
Just as planned
I don't drink coffe :D
Hah
lmao
java's terrible, unfortunately...
Lightning-Quill: Yay! I'm so glad that classmate of mine convinced me to watch an episode! Who knows maybe if he didn't maybe I would just watched an episode anyways :P
lol
Deathnote
Sumica: (\
XD
lol
poor celestia
Dr_Fumbles: if possible, you might consider trying a different language first to get the feel of coding down
rollin rollin rollin
00,10I kinda regret i did't join the fandom sooner.
cows
Don't we all, Sumi?
MirrorImage: I'm considering it... any suggestions?
actually, java is formidable. it'S just a slow fuck
i started with Visual Basic and it works out great for me
What I like about MLP is that is a diamond in the rough
i didnt
um
Lightning-Quill: wrong euphemism there
it's extremely plain-english, so there's less thinking about syntax and more on actually learning logic
Crash
Lightning-Quill: but I know what you mean
wall
splat
(and no SEMICOLONS)
Dr_Fumbles: python has its charms, definitely easier to pick up than java
flyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
;
That mountain must be in the Top-Percentage to stop Rainbow Dash.

Dat sound!
Though C# might do as well
!
Alright, I'll look into it, thx
FWIM

never used that
Game Over
GAME OVER
taLK TO ME DUDE
Nice goin' Twi.
;(

MirrorImage: C# is Microsoft's version of Java.
wicked: NO! :[
TWILIGHT? TWILIGHT?! TWILIGHT!!!!!
oh man I remember dat show
fair enough then - i return to my original suggestion
nope
I mean in better words it is a show that is in essence good in terms of values over other shows that lack being even remotely good. Most are just brutish
Be very afraid
XD
God, this opening theme STILL creeps me out
ikr
MirrorImage: yeah, it's pretty much true
lol
Aw
LOL
Blaugh
LOL
XD
God, the quality alone jumped SO much between 1 and 2
I was originally trying to learn Java to mod Minecraft, but now I can see myself in a programming career
Dr_Fumbles: random question, but what program are you using to learn Java?
Wtf is up with Pinkie Pie
HEY TOM!
mmumummumuuumuuu
appleblooms face... xD
She's high.
Xaiden: like what?
On.
prefer pinkie's brew, thianks
Heh
Cupcakes.
okay Bronies, I got a hangover to go sleep off
MirrorImage: Eclipse
go go pony rangers
POWAH RANGAHS
So relevent...
How much longer is this?
good, was going to suggest that
Xaiden: she's a hyper active pony of improbably possiblities.
00,10alot of that goes from upgrading the hardware they used otakon
o.o
Main Reason: It makes me happy
Well I'm going to go to bed when this ends
im equestria clown. laugh at me:D
HELLOOOO Bronystate
Sumica: I figured, plus using better qualtiy scenes and the general improvement of the animation fo S2 as well
hiya CrimsonPhoenix
I'm gonna go curbstomp Whitney
hi CrimsonPhoenix
the changein tone....
/me pokes CrimsonPhoenix
xD
Dat LAzytown...
What's up in da web
Lol
otakon: But the key ingredient was that the team actually loved what they were doing.
God Lazytown
I NEVER UNDERSTOOD THAT SHOW
dis song
HELLOOOO CrimsonPhoenix :P
and this is my least favorite skit
otakon it's a show about GETTING ACTIVE
00,10well they could not do much cause if they had to much in a clip you got rendering errors like with the pony with only one eye in the best night ever.
if only bc I find this "song" utterly repugnant.
and there's a villain that doesn't like that
This seems to fit
CrimsonPhoenix: then why call it LAZYTOWN?
/me just testing.
Sumica: that was... weird...
so he goes and make it lazy again
well, i'm out for the night
Back
well try
otakon: Irony.
CrimsonPhoenix: and have the weird puppet mask people
/me is derping
/me pulls out GBA.
MirrorImage: G'night
night MirrorImage sleep well
/me slaps admins
CrimsonPhoenix: That seems like a very poor villain plot
o.o
00,10but yeah the animation went way up
in fairness. Teletubbies is fucking weird too when you thin about it
Sumica: eeyup
/me plays Sonic Battle.
00,10such as the bit in leson Zero
but there's a hero, in a zeppelin, coming down to put the kids active again :D
supppppppppppppp..... OH sorry i got stage frite. not a coment just a joke
*think
00,10with twi troting at camera

Proof positive that the saxaphone is the sexiest instrument around.
How sad is it that I know the bit that will come up next... EVERY TIME
SpadeMagnes[R]: odd song, but good beat
Sumica: Tio be fair, Studio B was trying to do something no-one ever really had tried-- to use Flash to make GOOD animation with a decent budget. It took a while to work out some of the kinks. Thankfully. THose kinks gave us Derpy.
I want that a my TF2 spray now
damn awesome
00,10eeeyup

Koyaanisqatsi

11,01Never heard of that game.
CrimsonPhoenix oh, well buck that. I'm voting for . . . uhh . . .

Unnr_NoPower: not sure if should say goodnight or o hai
Lunar_Brony: its realllllly early in the morning
You say goodbye, but I say hello
hi Dr_Fumbles

hello
so g'morning is best pony
I mean answer
Unnr: Good Morning. That could be a potential pony name.
So... no more streaming?
Hmm, sounds like a weather pony
Reikim hmmm . . . nah
Unnr_NoPower: Also why are there two of you?
Dr_Fumbles not curretnly
mmmm... cherry limeade
Reikim, because I am in brown out conditions, and my desktop which I was connected on crashed but the client didn' t disconnect
wicked just walked over and started punching me, no joke
and I have been too lazy to ghost and reconnect
Unnr_NoPower: Ah, makes sense. No worries then.
Unnr_NoPower ugh, that can get annoying
hes back
brown-outs
Lunar_Brony: its been over 40 hours of next to no power
My fridge and freezer had to be completely tossed out
T___T
dang...
incredible. that heat wave is headed my way ... though they say it won't get up to 40C like it did east of here
nowq
]=/'
It's only 4,605C here
Unnr_NoPower I would never, EVER, survive those conditions
now wicked is making me type stuff
but yeah, no power worth speaking of and temps during the day of 39 C or so
yay!
aw shit. 81 degrees at 1:30 am?!!?
disregard anything i say for a while
Tolver 28 C currently here
last time I was pulled away from internet for more than 3 days, all I did was sit around and talk to myself for hours. Good and bad, however
Air conditioning ftw!
Just enough power for modem and trickle charge of the laptop
/me looks to the left
/me looks to the right
/me sees no stream
Hm.
It's 27 C here.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrTBgTCs-Ew
Anyways, to the hot, sticky bed
niow he's muttering about bronystate
Reikim: You didnt look up, look again
Unnr_NoPower: There was no way that was unintentional.
/me looks up
/me looks down
/me still sees no stream
he says he's gonna humiliate me
he says it better work
My bed should be stickier after seeing Chel.
Reikim: Did you look under the tray?
/me looks under the tray
Waaaait
There is no tray
/me looks inside his pop can
there's your problem
empty
lol
/me cracks open a Coke
I suppose next I'm supposed to look behind me, but I suppose that's dangerous now
much better
yes
I put bait out, maybe it'll lure the stream from hiding
Can you check behind me? I'm scared now.
Ahem, Slenderman
Friendchips
I mean, as long as it's not Candlejack or something, I should be fine. But if it is that would be terr

Reikim saw Slenderman? :p
hi Phase4
Lunar_Brony: I kept having to resist the urge to throw money at my screen.
Hm
No slenderman here, though I think an enderman took the stream...
Why
pony5432 I threw a can of Coke at it when reaching for my wallet. Thank Celestia it was empty
Lunar_Brony: By the way I'm Reikim but my nick is for some reason unavailable to me.
Ah that's better
Lol, I hate it when that happens
Back from mah shower :)
/me performs another all-around stream check
Good work Ponies47
I hate all things! my compute crashed when i started that vid Reikim
Reikim I know that feel. Ryanier128 used my username before I came here, but Canadian_Brony and other variants bring up some good conversations
Dovah: try again. its worth a crash or two

hi hen3ry
Same here
Sup, Cana?
. . . oh lord, am I killing the chat again?
here we go . . .
No, you're not killing it.
...wut? dead?
It's dying of natural causes.
Nah it was already dying
makes snese
http://derpy.me/pVOUO
much better
Killing it would be saying something ridiculous until no one wants to talk anymore.
Well, today was a busy day.
Lottery yet?
already passed, JRP
JRP2234[iPhone], http://www.bronystate.net/2012/07/06/lottery-results-7612/
What is the lottery thing?
meh movies Great ponies
Gfggtgfddyygddrts
meh mostly because I haven't heard of those
they might be glorious though
OR, hen3ry, if they can't find whatever movie that's scheduled
how about a nice game of thermonuclear war?
Polydunami: that's more a "sorry, uh, can't accomodate" than a veto tho
Why DO I ALWAS FUCKING NOT THIS LOTTORY aaaaahh
Yeah, Wargames was a good movie back in the day.
Sorry f I'm in and out. I'm trying to find scary games to play
what's the other one?
never seen it but I know the meme. looking forward to that
Lightning-Quill, YOU AND ME IN PM
B movie is called Young Frankenstein :S
mel brooks
Mel Brooks again!?
Never seen it but given the man's track record, I'll give it a shot
What are the chances of my movie getting played
Was
Spc containment breach
about 1 in 160 or so.
at least that was the rough number of entries today
wasn't Young Frankenstein from tasmania?
But my movie is the best!!!!2
doesnt matter. lottery picks it
Hat, it's random. Allegedly.
they showed Final Fantasy movie.
Has anyone seen Miracle Dogs Too?
I believe in random crap happen
sometimes they post a link to the random number site they use with the result. sometimes not =P
Nope, Hat, and I don't plan on seeing it.
Don't it's terrible
Goo blues
Woah, the chat server was just f'd up for a second there
I chose a B movie that is so B movie! :d
If the lottery picks a movie that isn't out yet, does Bronystate still show it on the stream?
Okay, if it's a live action movie and the main characters are dogs, my first instinct is to stay far far away from it.
how would they, hat?
That's correct Polydunami, but the dogs are only in two scenes
hen3ry, because Bronystate is cool
Well, 101 Dalmatians wasn't so bad.
Mainly because Disney
The new MLP is pretty good as well
Hm?
cool, but not able to bend the laws of time and cinematic distribution
They haven't tried yet
Well, yeah. But I meant live action, Hat.
:(
/me Hates CGI
I killed the chat :(
Eh, there ARE good movies done mainly in computer graphics
Ponies47 IMPOSSIBRU! That's my job!
Mostly ending in a dance scene
Polydunami: Yes there all. But some CGI -_-
Zombie_Brony, you bring things back from dead
*are
Hat I am dead
Bad luck
So people really like the Madagascar movies. I'm skeptical.
Ice Age?

Shirt 2: http://www.hottopic.com/hottopic/PopCulture/EverythingElse/ComicsAnimeCartoons//My+Little+Pony+DJ+P0N-3+T-Shirt-146832.jsp
You guys are lucky: I graduated high school before the whole brony craze.
Shirt 2 is alright
they had a bunch of stuff at FYE in Center City fillydelphia
shirt 1 is WHY WOULD YOU WEAR THAT
mon francais est tres stupide :)
the belts
Zombie_Brony homeschooling is actually a peice of cake, there's not really anything difficult in my courses, so I guess i'm lucky... xD
je arret
:)
SparklyWaffles u ever have problems w/ bullying <_<
SparklyWaffles high school has ups and downs, and so does home school
Somthing tells me CrimsonPhoenix wants to smack a filly now :s
ChronoClutch, Par contre tu n'utilise pas Traducteur Google. Je suis impréssionéÉ
nope
people call you a brony fag call them a bunch of pussies works every time
CrimsonPhoenix I totally flunked French 8. What the hell did you just say?
i was in french immersion
for like 4 years
mycutiemarkisagun Only when I was in grade school, but grade 7-9, I was friends with everyone
gaige: Thanks for the advice /)
and then said f dis and quit
I've said that I was impressed you haven't used Google translator.
oh....wow.......that was meant to be a joke. Cuz, ya know, home school.
i kno
gaige I have never been insulted for watching the show because I am a boss at holding my poker face
CrimsonPhoenix, remember; for the question mark on a French keyboard, you shift+6.
er
Oh. well okay. xD
awkward <_<
sup yall
I keep forgetting that
SUP
and french is my native language...
I almost typed shit instead of shift.
unless I blush, but I wear a hat. It's shadow hides it well
i wasnt insulted because i dont walk up to random people and talk about the show i talk about it when its brought up
Polydunami nice one.
I hate being used to english keyboard
I NEED TO LEARN DVORAK
sup
man
i love talking about the show
but nobody talks about it
its taboo?
ChronoClutch, no its not but what is there to discuss?
ChronoClutch: My brother hits me or starts making fun of me if I do in his face -_-
besides how awesome it is?
well
Did you say something, CrimsonPhoenix? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yctfXIqugXc
Goodnight everypony
Night Dovah :)
gaige I only talk about the show if someone asks about it. Mostly I just say "I like ponies. Ponies are cool." and put my headphones on
g'night Dovah

Ponies47 sup :D
BOO... still no one said hi to me :p
I supplied Dvorak the composer, Lunar_Brony.
dvorak also serves as a way to keep people from using your computer. because no one knows the layout =P
wicked: Stop saying sup and hi already -_-

WAZZAP
Hey ACS13123 sorry :$
Tassadork, Oh gosh I haven't thought of that

SparklyWaffles blech
04I just came off of a Goosebumps marathon in which me and a friend racked our brains trying to recall a certain book that ended with the words "stay out of the woods," or "don't go into the woods." We eventually found the book and the episode for it but the episode didn't end how we remembered it.
Ponies47: u got ur mlp shirts right?
Sane_Brony *bites your arm*
Goosebumps. Now that's not a name I expected to hear again.
04Hey man, Goosebumps is good
SparklyWaffles ha! Jokes on you! That was a fake arm that explodes when it receives pressure
04I prefer Are You Afraid of the Dark myself, though
i enjoyed goosebumps
original psychotic versus nega-psychotic
Ghosties I'm sane . . .
Oh God, NO *runs before it explodes*
I remember my mom being totally anal about the horror genre in general.
Ponies47: may i ask what kind of ponies did u get for your shirts?
Including Goosebumps and Are You Afraid
SparklyWaffles just wait . . .
/me grabs his tranquilizer
/me Twilight Lesson Zero Smile
Sane_Brony STAY AWAY!
lol
oh SparklyWaffles. Where are you? I have a pleasant surprise for you . . .
/me cracks his knuckles
Sane_Brony *shutters and closes eyes shut*
*Dash
Okay, that's enough. I'm getting out of here.

There. I'm happy.
00,02it seems that garry's mod realy needs counter strike
For the most part
00,02explains why they bundle them
yep
00,02not sure if i want to buy css
00,02or $20 of cheese
Its really fun, its worth it
Ponies47: he is afraid he is going to like the show :D
00,02thats how i rate games, wether or not i'd enjoy the same ammount of money spent on food more than the game
00,02$20 is a lot of cheese
Ponies47 use ductape. I can give you an endless supply. After all, I made a ductape factory out of ductape.
buy wopper jrs, they are the equivelent of $1
00,02not here
on the moon
00,02woppers are ~$3
:D
*rubs eyes*
*snaps fingers* so close...
SparklyWaffles you seem tired. Wouldn't blame yah, I mean being chased by insane and . . . not-insane peoople can be tiring

SparklyWaffles you have no idea. My father's old leather recliner is older than me, but it's still damn cumfy
they only ony shirt i have is a rainbowdash one from fye
Lil_B: that isnt my computer :P
oh XD
PsychoticDoc considering ordering this shirt: http://www.redbubble.com/people/stinkehund/works/7383789-i-have-a-crush-on-rainbow-dash-with-text?p=t-shirt
Hi Lil_B & SparklyWaffles lol
Ponies47: i had to get my fluutershy shirt at a diffrent hot topic
fluttershy*
Lunar_Brony heehee
:P
i dont have a crush on rd... i have one on Ditzy lol
soon i will get a piano and learn how to play sum pony songs :$
SparklyWaffles I remember my 6-year-old sister telling my parents that Rainbow Dash was my girlfriend
lol :D ^
Lunar_Brony Haha!
I told her that I couldn't date a fictional character, but I heard a voice in the back of my head
o.o
"But if you could, she would be my marefriend."
lol i love/hate my back-of-the-head voices
I sing pony songs sometimes. One of these days I'm gonna go out into public and sing a pony song and record and post it onto the Ponies47 Youtube page MUHAHAHAHA! :P
this one I'm going to wear on the first day of school: http://www.redbubble.com/people/kuzcorish/works/7741397-stupid-people
whats Phase doing?
damnit, the first thing that comes to my mind is: "What are you talking about... Cupcakes didn't scare me..."
Ponies47 I did that once. Not record it, though, but I walked through town singing "This Day Aria". I got 7 brohoofs
phase is cookin food
i think imma wear my Flootershai shirt for first day of school
Lunar_Brony: Nice! But i start high school this year sso I have to make new friends. I'm gonna wait until I'm friends with some poeple and then tell em I like ponies :$
Lunar_Brony: O_O NICE!
Lunar_Brony instant win
i wonder how many comments i will get on my fluttershy shirt when i go back to high school
Ponies47 I remember my first year of High School. We went from the seniors of the school to sprites.
My highschool has uniforms...
PsychoticDoc *cringe* ouch. The last uniform I ever wore was for Elementary Choir
oh uniforms? havent wore one of those in awhile
Lunar_Brony: I have to go in one day before all the other grades do. I hate freshmen only day! :'(
Lunar_Brony: i went from uniforms to none to belts and tuckins to uniforms....
PsychoticDoc: I hate uniforms, ew...
>.<
SparklyWaffles: they stick to your back in warm weather lol
Ponies47: ur high school has a freshman only day?
PsychoticDoc up here, we go K-7, then 8-12. No middle school, and no uniforms
Ponies47: wow :D
PsychoticDoc: It's true.. xD
Lunar_Brony: k, 2-3 4-6 7-8 9-12 for me
imma going to be a Junior this year :$
PsychoticDoc 5 schools . . .
Ponies47 we dont' have that here
Lunar_Brony: Lucky -_-
Lunar_Brony: Indeed, it can get very agitating registrating for them all
Ponies47 not totally. First day of Grade 8 was terrifying.
My brother is a jerk. He says I'm gonna be a high school drop out. He jut thinks he's better then me. Show off -_-
i know seniors get out of school earlier here at my high school
Lunar_Brony: 8th grade was meh for me
Walk right in and avoid ALL crowded areas
*shutters* ooh, I hated 8th grade.
I don't remember using the bathroom much, either
i enjoyed 7th and 8th grade :$
Thank goodness I'm done with middle school.
Grade 9, I'm walkin' around feeling like I own the place
Lunar_Brony: during 5-6th grade, we had outdoor bathrooms that has moss and green stuff allover the place
Ponies47: why?
PsychoticDoc eeesh
PsychoticDoc: Oh Dear God
Lunar_Brony: needless to say, i mastered the art of holding it for around 9 hours straight
man college is coming really close just need to complete 11th and 12th grade :O
PsychoticDoc the only reason I didn't use the bathroom in Grade 8 was you walk in there and you see a Grade 12 and you think "This guy's gonna pound me into the floor."
Ponies47: wow that sucks :\
eeyup
Ponies47 dem squees
Lunar_Brony: that and the fact that it gets very uncomfortable if your not very tall like the older people in there
I better hit they hay. GOOD NIGHT EVERYPONY! :)

08,01morning
Incorrect ACS13123. MW2 gamemode in Gmod on a CSS map.
ohai xax
XAX: wry you not on game
Herp
08,01so last night in an RP, i made it my mission to always refer to the other RPer's male parts as something different each time
08,01getting more and more ridiculous as i went on
what were some of the more riduculous ones you used?
08,01"pegacock" was one
08,01"flutterpenis" too
XAX...why did you get off?
08,01i just thought of another one now
oh..
what is that?
08,01"pleasureyoke"
this was a MLP RP, right?
08,01it was
okay, it would have been a lot weirder if it weren't
08,01there were several times last night where i was laughing too hard irl to continue for several minutes
08,01never laugh at your own jokes
08,01unless youre genuinely funny, like me
that meagerness
Shamroc: And then I got kicked off because I was up till 5am last night.
oh derp
and why are you back?
iPod.
08,01XAX: nice, im on my phone
08,01but my phone has a physical flip out keybpard
:o
sxc
what phone do you have?
08,01HTC Desire Z
ah
08,01its a pity HTC arent going to be making any more keyboard phones
08,01this is a fantastic phone
yeah, i always find it hard to type correctly on my phone (Galaxy S2)
I more often than not just use the voice recognition
Phase4: im gonna have to get off soon...3am..
00,02O_O
00,02bed Shamroc
5:30 Am
hmm?
00,02i'm downloading the dedicated server for gmod
Phase4: what is this "bed" you speak of?
00,02because using the intergrated would meen changing the port fowards
Shamroc: Bunnyhopping is a completely valid strategy when it can be used.
/me runs
XAX! COME BACK HERE DAMNIT
Shamroc: YouTube search "phoon too much for zblock"
Phase4 U got L4D2?
yeah i dont want to
00,02yeah

Well PsychoticDoc you can add me on stam then... masterboss43
Cp_MasterBoss43: done
OK.
Just wait couse my steam is bucking up...
I need to restart my computer i think...

XAX: i'll smack thee

Shamroc: Please sir, no.

my steam is my brony state name
what in celestia's name......
gunna get a drink brb
08,01my god
08,01reading through the backlog of another channel...
08,01you see the funniest things sometimes
08,01though im not sure if this one of clean enough for here
nope
on second thought, ive been up for 40 something hours, ima go teh bed
Shamroc: What am I looking at exactly....
00,02this server: 103.23.148.198:27017
Liokin: gmod...
/me 08,01looks around
you wont see me
08,01i might as well say it, it made me laugh hard
08,01so RP was happening, and someone managed to out ridiculous me
Shamroc: Wow...its like gaming tried to abort a baby but failed so it made this god awful mixup death chamber of randmones....
wut?
Phase4: sposed to shoot it
Run from what???
08,01an example: "its a model of the big bang, but with my cum"
08,01i lost it when i read that
Jolly good derp PsychoticDog.
08,01because this was during an honest to god sexytimes rp
However, i have no idea how that should be a helpful model
ive been accepted to the source filmaker it finnished installing so..gunna check it out, cya later
08,01Liokin: it was a cumgularity
08,01its mass was all contained within its schwarzchild radius
<_< >_>
08,01it was *sunglasses* a white hole.
08,01YEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAH
=.=
ohhh I get it....like black hole...but with...ahh yeah...
08,01anyhoos, i think im pushing slightly past the boundaries of PG-14 here
08,01so lets talk about something else
that is just sad...pg buckin 14...ehhh..
ok... i just finished ME3 with the new ending DLC... it fixed so many issues i had with the old ending...
08,01Liokin: channel rules, im afraid
cause all the other channels are closed down unless its movie night
08,01Liokin: i like it that its PG in here, actually
08,01there are plenty of people in here who are uncomfortable with talking about mature things
08,01some of the mods, certainly
08,01for example, valthejean
08,01some like to keep ponies innocent
08,01most, actually
<_< >_> im not one of those people...
08,01anyway, there are other channels for talking about sexytimes
all the sexytimes
08,01like #stupidsexytwilight, which i made when for when i wanted to talk about sex and sexuality without polluting this channel
08,01not an official bronystate channel, btw
chat derp
its just that it seens some rules censor the fun of things
Im not saying you need sex orientated things to have fun
so i herd u gais liek d'aaww http://i.imgur.com/r1Ptk.png
08,01Liokin: did you see my above posts?
no sir i didnt
Chat derped
08,01some like to keep ponies innocent
08,01most, actually
08,01for example, valthejean
08,01anyway, there are other channels for talking about sexytimes
I get that. But I didnt say ponies were what needed to be uncensored
Phase4: your lack of replu
08,01like #stupidsexytwilight, which i made when for when i wanted to talk about sex and sexuality without polluting this channel
reply*
08,01not an official bronystate channel, btw
00,02my lack of what now?
08,01anyhoos, if *i* can enjoy a pg channel just as much as a non pg channel, so can you buggers :P
00,02oooo
00,02dedicated server is allmost downloaded
look... if this chat wasnt kept at a PG-13 level, there would be chaos... it would literally be just like 4chan forums, pretty much worthless
08,01what are you playing Phase4?
08,01ah
08,01Atler_Tempest: exactly. itd be like #brony, which is a horrible place
08,01its much more light hearted and fun in here
08,01indeed
08,01i mean, its a matter of freedoms
moop
and no one talks about /b/... <_< >_>
efffiiinnn chat derp!
08,01freedom to and freedom from
what is this /b/ ;p
ook im back
ohai
08,01this chat is the way it is, a friendly, welcoming atmksphere, partly because we have freedom from mature stuff
yep..
I suppose but what about others who feed off of the more adult culture
Gore
Comedics beyond standard
there is still mature stuff, but its kept within tasteful limits
nudity
08,01we lose the freedom to, say, come in and start complaining about our sex lives in great detail
night everypony its 4am for me..and sleep is needed
Liokin: things like Gore and Nudity wont be shown here unless its in a movie that the mods have cleared...
08,01but we gain freedom from some associated natiness that comes in large unregulated chats
08,01see you Shamroc
08,01we want bronystate to be fun and accessible to the most possible people
I'd say we're free but also smart enough to know that no-one cares about simple little negative things.
08,01so this means keeping it pg
fly
:)
08,01as i said before, a lot of bronies like to keep any pony related things innocent
08,01we wouldnt want to scare people off
yeah, if someones not enjoying because of me, then i'm not enjoying.
08,01this is a safe, happy place
ok back AGAIN
i dont mind any of the adult material, but i wont bring it to this channel...
Hi all and what in the world is tthis?
08,01could someone be a doll and pastebin my last 20 or so lines for Liokin ?
lol
08,01i would but im on my phone
Irish_Pony: :Oi have no idea
I just woke up, so I'm afraid I'll have to decline.
:D
xD
ive honestly never seen someones chat derp this much... liokin should probably use a different IRC instead of the one built into BronyState...
ok befire anything else happens
so... what is this? a earthbound counterstrike?
adult oriented chats do have their own channels...
you can also make your own channel if you so wish
Atler_Tempest: Yeah when someone makes a temporary one
Hi everybo- O___0
What is this? :S
Liokin-: yeah, or if you wanna discuss something adult based with other people you can PM them... the bronystate mane chat is family friendly
talking about nudity or sex, normally isnt that
DB_Brony: Yeah, I saw. The title came up on stream
Good morning, Twi_Fi
and that guys chat probably derped again... ffs... i hate talking to people this way >_<
I'd say that if it's adult oriented, probably not everyone on the mane chat wants to hear about it.
hello every one
hello cow334 :)
hey, cow334
hello MegaMoonShine and DB_Brony
This looks like an interesting Mother 3 fangame.
Ahh, I thought those looked familiar :$
/me sighs. 'Guess I'll turn on the stream and see what is being talked about'
ok... all i see is programming...
and now... pigs?
It might be hard to understand if you've never played Mother 3.
And back.
>_< ive played Mother 3... this is just weird...
I've never played it :D
hmm... this is kinda... meh

08,01wooooosh
oni_link: ive also been up since 8 yesterday...
08,01imma do the book
MAlavolent: Im gonna do a book. awww :9
Phase4: btw is that the actual sourcecode or is it a decompilation?
:)
lol
00,02shana, decompilation
This is why I love this chat :3
00,02shana, not sure how to contact the orignal author
08,01Phase4: carrier pigeon
00,02havent found anything from him/her newer than 2003 and they're japanese
Atler_Tempest: ohhh you should rest then
Phase4: telepathy
Phase4: yeah me neither
08,01i want some food
then go feed
08,01ive had a very tiring morning
00,02shana, i'm not sure of the legality of it but theres a few things i could definantly release
08,01for reasons i shant go into
00,02eg: utf-8 encoded resources
00,02instead of the broken shift-jis they're in now
00,02not entirely sure how java handles missing classes
00,02i imagine its an exception thrown when you try to instance it
00,02i'ma assume that cause it makes this simpler
missing classes is rather rare oO
08,01thats more or less correct
08,01afair
unless you do dynamic loading of classes and stuff..
08,01Liokin: ukofequestris.co.uk
Phase4: what class is missing?
08,01Liokin: ukofequestria.co.uk
Whoa my dropbox was upgraded to 52.8 GB for setting it up on my SIII :O
08,01nice
00,02shana, two places this ocours, one is JTablet (extention that most likley does not exist on any random system) and java.awt.GraphicsEnvironment which is standard sense java 1.5
feelsgoodman.jpg :)
00,02this targeted java 1.1
00,02oni_link, Dat quota
00,02hmmm
yes quite Phase4 :P
Phase4: did you add jtablet to the classpath?
00,02shana, i'm not getting the exception, just wondering how it handles it
ah ok
phase4
00,02http://db.tt/mgKeCIPa click here if you want dropbox
00,02i get an extra 500MB for everyone that signs up from that link :3
Phase4: i want to show you somthing
in gmod
^_^
00,02dont *need* the space but theres a few things that might happen where it will be invaluable
i would like to welcome to the memorial for carlton
Phase4: If you had told me like 2 months ago, I would have used that link
Phase4: is registration enough or do I have to use it?
00,02shana, registration should be enough
/me yawns
00,02paintchat is now warning free
00,02except for the http server
Morning everypony
00,02but thats crap inside crap
00,02EggWhite, morning
Hello EggWhite
00,02dat 12:51
Heh, crap inside crap.
I'm gonna use that.

How is everypony?
00,02private static final byte strHttp[] = "HTTP/1.0".getBytes();
00,02i'm like dat
08,01aaargh
08,01srsly?
i have to wait 20+mins for my download ;-;
Phase4: without surpressed warnings?
00,02shana, yup
00,02well, i dont think there are any supressions
Heya
08,01hey!
00,02yeah, no supressed warnings
00,02shana, yep
00,02didnt take that long
00,02~15 minutes for the bulk of it
The mods, the community and everyone in IRC here are they reasons I keep coming back :$
/me 00,02hugs oni_link
aww
nice work ^_^
thanks
00,02i've allso fixed some bugs
00,02bigest one so far was in the connection code
00,02you *can* set the hostname in the .paintchat file, but due to stupid it wouldnt work
00,02fixed that
00,02brb'
k
00,02ded chat is ded
chat is asleep
Whats all the technicall mumbo jumbo then, I should understand, but lack of sleep makes brain bluuuuuurg
yearrrrrrrrrrrg i am back
And chat is rather ded in the time I've been on 6 people (including myself) have spoken out of 105

00,02y u no layer properly
Phase4: better!
00,02i like how eclipse complains about the spelling of 'int' in comments
hahaha
Ok 7 people out of 106 have spoken, 6.6% of the chat are speaking.
so that server is a no go eh?
lulz
If I can do math.
Phase4: I have written a python program that takes the raw network data from the paintchat server and produces a .svg file of the image... it's very rough but it produces something recognizable
00,02oh neat
00,02i'd love to see that
00,02havent got around to figuring out its network stuff
^^
00,02hmmm
00,02i apear to have trigered an exception
00,02with such a large stack it runs off the screen
dat long stack
Phase4: is it a out of stack space exception :D
00,02XD
00,02shana, that would have been funny
00,02it was a null pointer
00,02oh god
00,02this file did not encode well
00,02stupid ffmpeg
So much blue in the chat.

00,02huh
00,02i broke conesole
What do you program exactly?
Phase4: this is an example output, converted to png and downscaled: http://s8.postimage.org/74wgtqccz/foo.png
00,02MAlavolent, paintchat
Phase4: it doesn't supported the brushes and such.. only renders path and color
00,02shana, not bad
Oh, that's fine too. Though console breaker is pretty badass.
00,02shana, i would help you with the brush code but i think i've found the brush code
00,02i call it M.java
00,02aka: HELL
Phase4: http://pastebin.com/dswk9YaD it's actually pretty small code :D
00,023.6k lines of obfuscated java
Phase4: yeah some of my code is from the decompiled java
00,02shana, do you have a bitbucket account?
wow dat drawing
Phase4: I don't, could make one
00,02make one and i'll give you read access
phase4 it might work on this map
00,02[wklmjhe]JRP2234, nope
camn u host one see if its just me?
00,02[wklmjhe]JRP2234, trying now, whats one of the internal maps called?
gm_construct
rofl "You are seeing this message because this HTTPS site requires a 'Referer header' to be sent by your Web browser, but none was sent. "
00,02der we go
00,02shana, XD
I hate the referer header

Hallo. I return. ~_~
Hi FairysHuff
00,02that was a strange bug
Phase4: http://pastebin.com/eCdGKpnD this is the script for mips, outputs the stream to stdout.. works rather well
Chat dead huh?
00,02[wklmjhe]JRP2234, try join mine now
oni_link Hallo
00,02ah
Phase4: also good for recording the stream
How ya doin today?
00,02shana, see rtmpdump isnt in the arch repo's
it worked NOW TELL ME HOW U DID THAT
00,02so i used wireshark to find the rtmp url
00,02they have no protection on their streams
/me is pulling alot of strings around the world for Brony sharing.
Phase4: yeah finding the rtmp parameters is always a pain...
FairysHuff: you seem tired
Phase4: the ones from mips remain pretty constant, livestream.com is much more difficult..
oni_link I am. Didn't sleep well at all.
00,02livestream's flash player is a bit better though
00,02good enough that i just use it and dont care
FairysHuff: aw that sucks
yeah that's true..
oni_link yup
oh well at least you can relax for a bit right?
I think I partly do it because I can :D
meh am bored
gmod!

Kandarihu: or cod, or anyother FPS for that matter :D
Well, I'm playing Tribes: Ascend

EEZ COWARD KILLING TIEM
Oh thank god...
Finally...
Watched ALL of Bronycon stuff..
zzzzzz
Sorry, oni_link. I guess that goes without saying
hey guys
Kandarihu: Its funny cause I used to do it on Halo Reach. That or drive off a cliff with teammates in my Warthog :D
Okay, I see. That was horribly presumptuous of me. Of COURSE I'm not the first one to think of that.
the turret has been doubled!
Kandarihu: but I like your style of thinking nonetheless haha
lol i fucked the sy
spy*
Thanks
no prob :P
Kandarihu: Battlefield 2. Wake island. Get 6 of your team into a blackhawk. Plunge it into the ocean.

LightTrooper105: I signed up for the beta. Though, like CS:GO, im probably not gonna get it for a month or 2, if at all.

00,02unsepcified error, more commonly known as insufcient permissions
MisterFoster: Heh. Funny thing is, I started at Cupcakes, and it was kinda the reason I started watching the show.
dat fast 1.91 GB copy
00,02oni_link, 16GB ram, i has a lot of file cache :3
00,02that would have been near instant on linux
Oh, I'm jelly. I can't wait to use Ubuntu on my tower in about two months
i sort of liked it... but then i'm sort of scared to read another fan fic again... for at least a while anyway :3

hangon
Phase4: try and see if this works now
Phase4: Java tastic!
/me 00,02still hates java
Hi bronystate.
FillyFlam: Hi

Phase4: you bought garys mod?
00,02cow334, i did
00,02and counter strike because all the game modes people were sending me to needed its modles
Morning, everyone.
Dat oot port :o
Just casually roaming in the tabora desert on ratchet and clank when i find a pond. I go into said pond and see an enemy on the other side. I jump and swing my wrench and it hits the edge of the pond. I suddenly find myself swimming under the desert.
Okay.
man i keep getting a lot of chat derps
sounds like a glitch :D
to you Phase4 in G-Mod or not to join him... thats the question
but only chuck norris can swim on land
00,02maps are extracted into the garrysmod directroy, not the addons directory right?
oni_link: Exactly, my friend.
Phase4: There's a folder in garrysmod called maps
So yeah
you must have had your WTF face on when it happened huh?
00,02this mod has maps materials and settings
Phase4: Yeah, just extract it to your garrysmod directory

/me blinks "mods in zelda wut"
Damn this swim-under-the-desert glitch is hard to redo

Mornin'

good morning Orange_Peel! :D
welp. This is getting boring dB Bye.
morning Orange_Peel
I think we should watch Star wars this morning, today must be a star wars morning.
00,10I wonder if I can get mirc to line brake the names like Phase4 has on xchat
Toranaga: Sounds good :P
Does the admin know we aren't seeing the video? Just the desktop
oni_link Thanks!
I don't think the Admin does
Orange_Peel: Hes not here ATM
00,02hmmm
00,02what to do
Star wars?
there he is!
00,02woah
00,02inline classes inhearet their parents members
00,02thats cool
00,02i had this neat plan involving using a constructor but screw that, nice and easy
LAWL
Phase4: did you watch the Lee Tokar Interview? XD
08,01ge
08,01hey all
back from lunch did i miss much
00,02Vordox, was that the thing on cnn?
Heya!!
Phase4: Ah no, the interview from Inquirer
00,02suddenly NONE of the controls work
00,02i broke something
I think the interview was the one from EQI?
00,02Vordox, not yet
00,02Vordox, seen the cnn thing?
Whats on CNN?
00,02XD
Phase4: I'm 100% up to date on everything :P
Played in clubs?!
:d
00,02clubs that play this song are best clibs
00,02clubs'
R.I.P Andy Griffith
really Phase4 we have music thats made in clubs
+Phase4 so true
Darkts3"Drawing|MLG when did he die
Phase4: meh
Yeah Griffith seemed like a really good guy
alexxm: about 3-4 days ago
damn i never really saw any of his stuff
ikr
It's always someone who died, someone who had an affair, someone charged with molesting kids, drug problems, anything
/me is working on dem chiptunes
Phase4: I'd prefer ANY song with good beat
And not some crazy hip hop crap that sucks
Quality wise, effort wise, and feeling wise.
00,02^
00,02soo much utter crap out there right now
If there are 10K+ people in any group, some of them are doing something. Just a function of how many celebrities there are
Also Phase4, what'cha up to, what c++ you do?
todays music doesn't have that feel
-6
00,02this is java, c++ would probably be easier
oni_link: Some has.
Phase4: Oh the Paint chat thing?
00,02then again a c++ decompile...
08,01any SST regulars in here?
Vordox: well as a whole it doesn't
00,02sst?
00,02Vordox, yeah
SST?
08,01stupidsexy
oh yeah...
one day bronies will rule the world...........
Most of the pony tunes are Dubstep I noticed
derp: my kinda world
indeed
,=,O-O
08,01anyhoos, any SST regs who are coming to buck, pm me
The fandom runs on consistancy of the show
Toranaga: I noticed
If it's the time between two seasons. Thats always the darkest
yes
00,02oh wow
00,02putting your mouse over those things on the left
When the show returns. Thats when people come back and the time when most convert
nyan remix
00,02ip addr and port things
00,02CREATES a thread
,=,O-O
So if the show got cancelled then the fandom would die in a matter of weeks.
Toranaga i became a brony during the break during the first and second season
Toranaga: pretty much when its topical
became a brony 3 weeks ago
08,01Toranaga: when
08,01not if
Exactly guys. The internet is the fandoms life support system
I became a fan in time to watch the season finale. and it was here on the stream :) <3
Yes, sadly it's certain the show will die at some point. We just have to hope not soon.
i doubt itll die soon
dont say tha
theres so much money flow
and hasbro are just realising how to tap into it
08,01i think this will be the last season
Chrysalis: exactly
The show and the fandom is in a coma, the only thing keeping it alive is the internet.
i joined bronystate around read it and weep oni_link
noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
If it's the last season then this wonderful and unique fandom would die.
Toranaga yes... thats why there are so many new fan arts and new fanfics uploaded daily
alexxm: niiiice :P
Holla everypony! :)
hi GilDash
and sites like this which are active pretty much 24x7
08,01oni_link: aye. i think if there was more of an overarching story arc, itd last longer
hey GilDash hows your day been
and most of the stuff we do isnt even ponies
its the best show on tv right nw and im not jokeing
alexxm: Not too bad, thanks. Yours? :)
been up for about an hour GilDash
alexxm only an hour?
iv been up 3
31*
wub wub wub
Chrysalis yeah
Chrysalis: Obviously you're insane and need to go to sleep. :D
Tobuscus
TOBUSCUS IS BEST PONY!
Dropshot
Wait what is this
dubstep pewdiepie?
Chrysalis: Sleep is only for the Weak Minded of Civilizations
it better not be!
suddenly buscus
Moldavite: Tobuscus, not pewdiepie
00,02urgh
00,02that bug has happened again
00,02no clue why
i quite like alot of buscus stuff
Oh thank goodness it's not that guy I dont like!
expecially his ad-hoc stuff
my oc :P
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/h23wyyalu1tf1t0/w1vSVv_ctN
dont know if cutie mark should be drum sticks or an NES controller
Some of the members of the fandom have poured their life in this show. So when it gets cancelled, they will be heartbroken.
wut
oni_link: Drumsticks.
I heard of stories about guys getting kicked out of their houses because they watch the show.
00,02shana, you here?
its true
Phase4: eyup
ohai scooter
bye scooter
FillyFlam: thanks, now I need a name :D
what was that just now Phase4 ?
00,02you wouldnt happen to know why java interprets file:// url's as ftp would you?
oh my godess'
CRUSH KILL DESTROY SWAG
oni_link: Now that I can't help you with, lol.
interesting song
No we wouldn't. I'm not much of a computer wiz
Phase4: which class do you use to handle the url?
FillyFlam: well thanks either way lol
00,02this song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk7xH-a3O9k
00,02shana, java.net.URL
anypony wanna help my name my oc?
silly Phase you cant post video links during stream
:3
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG mods do what they want
.gif
:33
Phase4: you mean when you parse the url with java.net.URL the protocal part will be file?
spaaaaaaaaaaaaace
Phase4: err I mean ftp
00,02shana, do you have a java ide installed?
Phase4: yup eclipse
Bye guy's Imma go play Shogun 2 now.
00,02shana, in the one thats on bitbucket now, put it in eclipse and run...

im dyeing...... dyeing of borrdom
Kerbal ;D
00,02i find that very impresive
typeing on my kindle fire by the way
Phase4: it starts fine, which buttons should I press to replicate the bug?
00,02shana, it starts fine?
00,02oh
00,02shana, action->client
Lol if you wait long enough on the loading screen of Ratchet and clank 2, Ratchet starts playing Jak 3
>_>
00,02i'm tired and assumed you knew what to do somehow
yes oice!!!!!!
00,02shana, it does URL(codebase url, './res/') and cant open the result
oice hate useing this thng totype
gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa noice noice noice ahhhhhhhhhhhhh
ok i know how to spell noise now
I'm back
Phase4: works fine for me
00,02strange
welcome to coding
Its early, I gotta nap. Ill see you all later. Hopefully today :D and thanks Phase4 for streaming /)
/me 00,02hugs oni_link
night oni_link
Phase4: can you point out file+line where the exception occurs?
00,02shana, line 193 of Data.java is where it breaks
00,02shana, great minds think alike /)
:)
soo long have long nights and pleasent travels
hey Dark92Enigma hows your day been
oni link
Phase4: hm thats in the runLobby function, is that correct?
00,02shana, its in init(), might be more than one Data.java
00,02the one in paintchat_client
ah ok
Hey guys, who are we watching today?
Phase4: have you changed the configuration
SpringStingray currently streaming is Phase4
stuff
00,02shana, not sure what config you're refering to
:D
Phase4: cnf/paintchat.cf
00,02dont belive so
alexxm I'm fine.,.....waiting for EL DORADO!
00,02i'll be anoyed if i have, i think thats in the bitbucket and is suposed to be the same as pchat366.zip
00,02aparently i have
00,02its looking in www/.paintchat
the many faces of pony;) i dont know how to do derpyns:) :( :D
00,02shana, the file exists
00,02shana, i'm getting an unknown host exception
Phase4: I have the same, the url it constructs for me is file:/bla/folder//Paintchat/www/.paintchat
Phase4: what kind of url do you get?
00,02shana, c:/path
00,02i think it worked on linux
Phase4: ah could be a windows specific bug :(
Phase4: c:/ is intepreted as the protocol or something like that..
00,02seems like
00,02but then again, its appending to the codebase
Phase4: I suggest not using net.url for constructing filenames
00,02have to, this is the applet code
oh..
00,02plus decompile, so not sure whats safe to change
Phase4: shoudn't getCodeBase return file://c:/path ?
Phase4: the doc says it returns a url
00,02thats the thing
00,02it should
00,02hence the confusion
00,02infact it does
00,02and constructs a correct url for a different path
Phase4: did it just say that C: is the authority part of the url oO?
00,02shana, it did
00,02i'm going to check its not doing something stupid like using URL(String, String)
Phase4: I think it does the correct thing... it parse the url and treats C: special..
Phase4: so there is no easy fix for windows..
Howdy y'all!
shana all relative addressing?
howdy Everlasting_Joy
http://fav.me/d56fhqw
Chrysalis: it's java that returns the absolute address
00,02its strange because it does exactly the same thing earlier in the code and it works perfect
Phase4: is it Awt.openStream in both cases?
00,02shana, yeah
00,02i think
00,02one sce
00,02yes
00,02if you click buttons too soon on the pframe, it lock sup
HELLO
GOOD MORNING EVERYPONY
00,02sonicandmario85, HELLO GOOD SIR, IT IS NICE TO MEET YOU
hey sonicandmario85 you sleep well
Afternoon here in the British Isles, but hello regardless! ^^
00,02theres a channel for allcaps, its not this one :P
alexxm:yep :3
BUT THIS IS THE TRADITIONAL ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE!!!
Morning sonicandmario85.
00,02hmmm
00,02i cant single step into URI
Phase4: Wait, there's a channel where you can talk in allcaps?
00,02URL'
00,02Everlasting_Joy, yep
i just use caps to shout XD
You can use %Bbold%B, instead.
PewDiePie:GOD DAMIT BOY YOU DISAPOINT ME SO MUCH!! Son:IM SORRY DAD ): PewDiePie:I DONT CAREEEEEE!! SHUT UP YOU FUCKING DISGRACE
xD
Shoot, that doesn't work on lightIRC. Works on Chatzilla.
wth
00,02shana, it has file as the url
what are you doing dere phase? :3
Phase4: it actually looks ok, with the exception that C: is authority and not part of the file..
/me glomps Phase4
00,02and if i put the url in firefox it works
/me 00,02hugs Bronysith back
00,02sonicandmario85, debugging stupi
00,02stupid'
MY WUBS...PASS THEM AROUND
00,02shana, as far as i can see the url is correct
ok i didnt know :P
00,02sonicandmario85, i meen the thing i'm debugging is stupid
Phase4: yeah but what if some code only uses the file part of the url, then windows won't find the file
00,02stupid ambiguious english
oh
00,02shana, then why can it open res.zip? twice?
Howdy Bronysith.
oy Everlasting_Joy
Phase4: hm.. can you breakpoint there and look if the url looks the same?
how are you Everlasting_Joy
00,02i cant step into awt.openstream
00,02no sources for some reason
00,02i have them on linux
Phase4: you'd need the java sourcecode for that
Bronysith: Pretty bad man. I have to cancel my show today due to me not having my laptop.
Phase4: btw. what's the exception thrown, file not found?
Everlasting_Joy: ouch
Bronysith: You get use to it.
00,02shana, unknown host exception
00,02its trying to resolve 'c'
oh whoa
also if you think windows 7 is better than windows xp its faster than 7 on mine but its slow on my computer because it has poor ram and its old it was designed for windows 98
that looks like it's ignoring that protocol is file oO
00,02it is
00,02its trying to interpret it as an ftp protocol
00,02i Had the problem on linux and dug through the system libs
00,02if it doesnt have a host it interprets it as ftp iirc
00,02wait
00,02if it Does have a host
00,02the host on this url is "C"
Phase4: yeah but it should see that the protocol is file and not unknown
08,01i smell wonderful
Damn them letters

Rainbow Dash:It Needs To Be About 20% Cooler.
:3
08,01it smells so much nicer tjan mens
00,02shana, it completly ignores protocol, cant remember in what file this breaks
08,01mens smells like public bathrooms most of the time
Phase4: hmm yeah host set could be bad..
08,01hmm
08,01maybe
Phase4: so why does it work sometimes?
08,01but still, i dont like the smell
00,02no .setHost method
00,02shana, can you break there and see what url it makes?
08,01mens deo smells sharper in general
08,01i like soft smells
-_- my ethernet is still down...stream keeps buffering
Phase4: can you give line number?
00,02shana, paintchat_client/Data.java:193
my dad has a deordirante stone you put water on it and then rub it in your arm pits and then use a towel on them and they werent sweaty anymore :D the smell didnt smell like a bathroom or anything xD
WHAT'S THE NAME OF THE SONG?
08,01i hope wreks back on soon

ohai demoman
00,02strange
Chrysalis Thanks :)
00,02host is set for the other things
I had to rage quit during B movie - stream would pause for a few minutes then would play and skip ahead to catch up - that garbled audio ticked me off
00,02the only thing i can think of is lack of a windows style extention
00,02it starts with .
00,02filename that is
doing it right now too -_-
isnt a file/folder starting with a '.' illegal in windows?
Allo everypony
Chrysalis: nope
huh, thought it was
hi Meanwhile mario
Chrysalis: Meanwhile has a mario hat
i have a BUCK hat
i have a headphone hat
Im back after 5 months!!!!!! BAAAAH! How did I survive!!!!!
XD
jk xD
I also have a ario hat.
*mario
everyone has hats?
Im off to raid Toys R Us - opens in 15 minutes - hopefully I find something on the shelf this time - plan B is I drive to College station over an hour away
OMG ITS TF2 IRL
I only have it because dari was like "You should get a Mario hat"
Chysalis This AINT TF2
So I did.
im just using headphones im not wearing any hats
theres a heavy hat which is just headphones
I'll try to find my hat
Hey whos playing the music
they are wireless too :#
Itll cover up my sh!tty hair cut
00,02Chrysalis, its NOT illegal, but explorer.exe will yell at you for trying to make one
applejack096 Phase4 is currently streaming
College Station is the next nearest Toys R Us store - :) I love living out in the sticks
Kk
Steaming the chat.

Allo Nail.
I'm quite colorful (in text) to mod point of view
Hi chicken
hi SuperBrony64
Phase4:how will explorer.exe yell at you? does it open up a window saying dont do it?
00,02sonicandmario85, it simply says its an invalid filename
Hey SB remember meeee! :)
so many colors
Yfw SuperBrony64 hasn't even said anything...
I know have mah mario hat on :D
00,02most of the win32 api simply doesnt care
And is probably not even at his keyboard.
00,02you'd have to Make it care, and that meens checks everywhere
Hello there everypony
Allo Obsidian.
Phase4: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=nfnNHiz0
Hey phase4s on skype!
*mines obsidian and makes a nether portal*XD
00,02yeah
00,02shana, its the authority bit
08,01worth noting: actual orgies happen in #stupidsexytwilight
00,02only difference
Do the color of each name mean anything or just random?
Phase4: also host
Obsidian is the best rock IRL... SO smooth... Like glass
00,02which yours lacks
lol
soo AMUSING
Worth noting: Only you and Nyria are into that stuff.
I'm afraid I must take off folks. I'll be back shortly.
And FlareChaser, apparently
Later Everlasting_Joy
what are you debugging for phase4?
Figures.
Phase4: if you clean the host part, does it work? e.g. do a setHost("") or something
Yawn
00,02shana, no way to set hostname
00,02i did it manualy via the debugger, now it seems to be stuck somewhere
unless you probally hack it XD
http://trollfacecomic.com/post/5770023211/troll-comics-usb-troll-rageguycomic-rage
00,02that seems to have worked
00,02now its deadlocked
So Phase4, what're you actually trying to do?
This music is kinda boring no offence or anything cuz u like it but COME N!!
Actually, before I go - did anyone watch National Geographic this week? There was some documentary scenario about what we would do if attacked by intergalactic aliens...
random
00,02huh
00,02Meanwhile, debug something
What?
00,02shana, it *worked* but it dies elsewhere now
Who me????!!!
applejack096 You called?
no
lol
Cypresswolf: I did not see that but I wish I did.
00,02might have to over-ride getCodeBase
00,02urgh
applejack096 well sy somethin like That is random next time will ya?
00,021am
There was something I found quite perplexing - that WE (some scientists) have declared mathematics as the universal language - think about that for a moment :)
00,02sleep/code/game?
I sed random because Cypresswolf was random TheRandomkid321
Phase4 HOLY CRAP IT IS!
No/No/Yes.
applejack096:You Cannot Go Alone Take This With You.*gives a tiny fluttershy*
00,02TheRandomkid321, utc+10 bro's /)
Phase4: does the url returned by getCodeBase also contain a host part?
Cypresswolf how is that perplexing, we use the damn things
Phase4: or is it just the new Url(url, "foo") bit that has the host part set?
we use it, we define it
Uhh yeah.. (\
08,01let wrek know im looking for him when hes on
k
00,02checking
ok pluto
00,02hmmm
00,02too early
hm never had such a deadlock
00,02need to check that deadlock if you use too early
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAKaym1gx3I&feature=bf_next&list=LLPAvCXct1pg-6eaOAgJ3flg
What do you mean cannot go alone *Adores the tiny fluttershy* ahhhhh thx sonicandmario85!
Lolita paint chat...?
00,02shana, the one where it *worked* wasnt actually a deadlock, the window poped up behind eclipse
=P
In the show, we found creatures on this planet respond to math - but we have not had outside contact by aliens at all - furthest weve gotten is Mars through robotics - not counting whatever that satelite that recently exited the solar system....
i did not hit her its not true its bullshit i did not hit her... I DID NAAHT... Ohai bronystate
00,02shana, url has the authority and host bit
Phase4: I'd consider that a java bug..
How can we truly confirm math as a Universal language based on studies on this single planet?
00,02probably
Ok wat wuz the mini fluttershy for sonicandmario85 its adorable but why!!
My mario hat makes my head itch :(
applejack096:i dont know XD
lollllollllipop!!!!!
Hey SB TALK!!!!!
wat mini fluttershy?
Plz
Nm valoreins
im watching power rangers samurai in real life right now
lol
We still dont know if there are any intelligent life out there - we can speculate based on the numer of stars & planets, but we have no clue - odds considering, we know its possible
someone put decent music on plz
08,01i beg to differ
RANGERS TOGHETHER SAMURAI FOREVER!
I beg you do not share anyone elses name.
Mighty Morphing > All.
00,02the url it returns when running from eclipse is different
00,02the crap is going on
Phase4: huh?
Phase4: how did you run it before?
i like mighty morphin best but i like some of the other ones like zeo in space and samurai those are all the ones i like including mighty morphin
00,02shana, from pframe
00,02i meen running from eclipse in its applet viewer
08,01im not
i miss zordon..
the entire documentary was a War of the Worlds scenario using tactics like Gorilla warfare to fight back once our planets manufacturing, military and communication goes - first half hour rules our weaponry useless against the aliens - interstellar travel > earth weapons
08,01all you need to do is join the channel anyway
though, they didn't mention bio weaponry...or at least I missed that part - give the aliens a cold
00,02shana, it has a custom getCodeBase /)_-
though not everyone in that channel is involed
PONYS TOGHETHER HARMONY FOREVER! xD
If there is anything I did not want to happen today it's find a list of folks who rp orgy.
00,02how insanely strange
GO GO PONY RANGERS
08,01actually, the channels mainly just for talking about sex and sexuality
00,02shana, i change the string litteral from file:// to file:/ and it seems to work
Phase4: I'd suggest a fix like this: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=MT2zuquZ (untested)
08,01but rp orgies sometimes happen
oO
I though aliens beneath National Geographic, but hey why not, we have the CDC preparing for possible zombie outbreak now
00,02shana, AppletWatcher.java
You're not helping.
00,02its a custom applet viewer
BY JAVA
XD
*hate
00,02stupid codebase
08,01ill shut up about it
00,02too large and obfuscated and confusing and java does not help
Thankyou.
Hi everypony.
00,02all fixed now
oh sweet what are we developing?
hello :3
08,01this isnt the place to discuss that anyway
Meh.
derp
Java applets?
08,01paradoxically, SST is...
Funkballs coding i think
GO GO PONY RANGERS
I see that. It's java in eclipse
but what are we coding?
Need to go. Night be back later. Bye everypony.
Im out - let yall know what I find this time
It... REALLY pains me to vote on rage comics... But someones gotta do it.
Phase4: strange that it works, so file://C:/foo does not work, but file:/C:/foo does?
PEOPLE Y U NO REALISE THAT JOKES THAT DONT REACH A LARGE VARIETY OF PEOPLE ARNT FUNNY!?
Phase4: Is there any logs saved between PMs in this Irc?
00,02shana, yes
Turtles.
ahh cool you guys to version control
00,02Vordox, i dont know
Phase4: GOVERNMENTS!
Princess Celestia:DUNGEON 13 HOURS
XD
Vordox: you mean wether ponychat stores the logs?
yes
I don't believe so...
00,02thats fixed
00,02look at deadlock or sleep...
00,02quick look at deadlock
what version on tortoise do you guys use Phase4 ?
Phase4:what are you debugging for?
00,02sonicandmario85, paintchat
he's trying to fix paintchat
00,02Bluestrom_S, tortise svn and tortise git
i tried going there but it whould just load and not go there
00,02as for the actual version, nearly latest but i cbf downloading the update
cool
00,02dont realy like it anyway, git > tortise git
tortoise svn in pretty awesome
00,02stupid windows cmd.exe mishandles stdin
I use git command line tools, and gitk/git gui
they come with the standard git distribution
pretty awesome toolset
the new github gui for windows is surprisingly nice.
Phase4: windows git comes with mingw and bash iirc
00,02shana, yes but it cant accept passwords via the terminal
Funkballs: never looked at it, can you compare it to gitk or git gui?
previously I just used the command line one and some eclipse plugins.
00,02tbh if i'm in a position where i need a gui, i'm pushing to a bitbucket or github repo
00,02so i can just use the websites
I think we can all agree the Opera Duck was the best part of Ponies the anthology II
00,02inb4 i'm in that position and internets not avaliable
KRBALS
KERBALS*
Phase4: have you tried the official git gui?
00,02shana, nope
THEY ARE INVADING YOUR DESKTOP PHASE4 :o
00,02sonicandmario85, that they are
00,02i'll explode them soon :P
java?
it's very clean and fast. Not sure if it works with non github repos though.
Phase4:try to go to the moon when you do and crash land on the moon :D
00,02oh god, its not seriously halting for that reason is it
very easy to see whats changed and manage multiple branches and stuff
/me 00,02think he;s found the deadlock
Phase4: hm thread.sleep is milliseconds, right?
or was it floating point seconds..
00,02Funkballs, it should work with any git repo, github does nothing spesific
I think it'
Saeriously has anyone caught the MLP theme faintly playing at the start of Daddy Discord?
ss milli
00,02shana, in miliseconds, theres probably a float overload though
anyway using Thread.sleep when waiting for a lock is pretty bad
one small step for kerbal XD
there's Thread.wait for that
00,02and just like that
00,02the deadlock is gone
00,02and i did nothing
00,02[buy some apples] you java
/me nuzzles Phase4.
/me 00,02hugs PonyNegZero back
Phase4: Java loves you too.
Phase4:whats paintchat for? can you paint pictures or something on it?
00,02i stand by my opinion that there is a way to do java wel
00,02well'
That was mildly peculiar...
lol
00,02http://www.bronystate.net/paintchat/
the java language hasn't gotten a lot of new features
00,02TheRandomkid321, chat derp?
No... My computer settings reset randomly?
00,02shana, yeah, but to be fair the language is prety much assembler for the bytecode
^_^
00,02compiler does bugger all from what i've seen
Just a moment guys.
only new language feature I can think of is the error handling being able to put multiple exceptions in one catch statement.
Phase4: ,=,e
javavm is probably the fastest vm there is..
I cant pause the stream? WHAT THE BUCK!?
00,02fun fact: the server is running here at my hose
Wait its good
00,02shana, not realy, .net exceeds it in anything memory heavy
00,02they just spent a LOT of money making hotspot fast
00,02same amount of effort on .net would yield more results
Phase4: ah ok, my sources are from http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/which-programming-languages-are-fastest.php
00,02suddenly clients
Phase4: Wait so is the paint chat open or is it closed for right now? or as of now or is it open
Phase4: but the microsoft vm is probably not listed there
00,02shana, mono is about as fast as it anyway
00,02about to exceed it
brb
Oy Phase4 ....
00,02not sure what benchmark they use
00,02ohai Vordox
so confusing
I want to see you program as fast as this guy can play. :P
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azmASqYPNc
In case you wish to see it.
Phase4: you can view the sourcecode for the benchmarks here: http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u64q/program.php?test=nbody&lang=java&id=2
THAT is the speed I want to draw...or program, or anything
Okay back
00,02listening to music, will play after Vordox
Ok. :)
that's kinda surprising. I woulda thought the overhead from the JVM would make JAVA slower than that
lower down the list
All you need is love....Hum hum humh...Isn't that one of the Beatles?
00,02shana, that benchmark is very impractical
00,02for java that is
00,02Vordox, yup
Vordox: you don't say?
Phase4: why?
String_Shredder: I only know 3 songs from Beatles. :p
all you need is love
daw
00,02shana, double, int, byte and something else are vm internals
<3
WAIT
00,02not objects
i didnt want that heart
Dat kick
All you need is love... And water.... and Blood... And food.... And a spleen.... And lungs.... And a heart.... And one kidney... and your intestines... and your brain... and you stomach... and your liver...and your spine...
Meanwhile: lawl
dat mega zord
00,02in practice you create a lot of objects, and all objects in java are heap alocated
cow334: :3
Phase4: yeah I see what you mean
TheRandomkid321: i think they coverd that part of the story lawl
Meanwhile: ,=,e
00,02gc pauses get out of hand real fast
cow334: Turtle. :D
I SAW THE KERBALS THEY ARE GETTING WORSE!
This guy is CRAZY
Meanwhile: yup :)
But THAT'S how fast I want to program. XD
Skill level : ASIAN!
THEY ARE DESTROYING HIS FILES D:
:O
hai
Daaaaaaamn.
This is one of the most famous videos on the internet, pre Torrent
HOLY SHIT
SUPER MODE ACTIVATE
WOAH
looks at him go
:O:O
ASIAN
IMPOSSIBLE!
just kidding
asians
Now play an actual piano.
So yeah Phase4 ....Program that fast. :P
Seriously, I bet on a real piano he'd be fantastic.
Phase4: i cant hear anything on the stream
00,02Vordox, his hands are made of speed
IMPOSSIBRU
cool:)
Phase4: XD LOL
wait okay i got it
00,02cow334, your end
its called crazy japanese guy.. and its a kid XD
Like holy crap...
Seriously...
Phase4: it's okay it started to make sound again
LOOOOOOOOOOL!
Look at this SCORE
Holy shit like seriously
He ranked THIRD! XD
DAT SCOORE!
Who the FUCK IS FIRST?!
asian? more like japanese
00,02Vordox, thats a heck of a thought
What did I miss?
Phase4: ^^
That's for the video...
PonyNegZero Asians doing Asian stuff
Still I want to see you program that fast someday :P
Make it happen!
00,02wish i could
TheRandomkid321: fair enough
he's good
00,02programings not realy about typing though
needs more tableflipping
Vordox: Jesus ranked first.
Phase4: It's about prethinking, then put it to work
replay the video
please
plox
00,02cow334, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azmASqYPNc

needs more speed
00,02XD
00,02shana, nice version
yay null pointers :D
Chrysalis that video has a need for speed
Phase4: :) it's weechat

wow
Want more random videos that make you go "WHOA?" ;)

00,02all i need to do is sign it, then everything works
Phase4: firefox
00,02shana, dats the plan :)
javascript is your friend
/me nods

Is that phase 4's OC in the corner there?
Woot is this Phase4 ?

Good music....

Needs more pony
Oh it's CLASSIC

Meanwhile... Yeah... Perhaps...
alexxm: oh, where's my manners? and how's your day going?
i've been good Strasin
I very much doubt Golakka goes around randomly telling people to take days off.
I haz fud! :)
M chest is very hollow... Is taht normal?
dat cygwin
TheRandomkid321 i don't know sorry
Probably where my heart used to be.
00,02DEBUGGING
00,02and scp
SCP as in containment breach?
Meanwhile: secure copy
00,02as in secure copy
00,02shana, /)
Scp? God I hate that "creepypasta" series.... I jst don't get it.
Phase4:try making it to where you can upload a picture on the chat XD
Much less interesting.
it's liuke ftp over ssh
Phase4: (\
,=,e
it's a turtle
likely story >:(
cow334 ----- its a worm BICH!
TheRandomkid321: ,=,O-O YOU FAIL
Funkballs: not quite, sftp is like ftp over ssh
this is a worm
____
I thought sftp was ssl?
00,02TheRandomkid321, tell me
Funkballs: that's ftps
00,02do you like bananas?
I seee
fuckin barrels...
<( ^^) It's a sperm
Funkballs: with sftp you can copy, download, move, create directories, etc. pp
BARRELS!?
TheRandomkid321: shh
no more
cow334... Okay...
▲
▲ ▲
TheRandomkid321, do you like bananas?
so next weeks movie night looks good
Nice going top triangle.
Yeah
Yeah I do
TheRandomkid321: k :)
whereas scp only copies?
Way to land like, two feet from the right of where you appear in the chat box.
▲
▲ ▲
And then meanwhile was a newfoal for about a minute
The top triangle dun wanna triforce.
Phase4: try 'AddType application/java-archive jar' in apache
Eh, I don't have it set right on my source.
00,02shana, thx ^_^
Try uhm... /fixeverything
And if I recall it doesn't land properly in mane chat like that anyway
i like to kill barrels :3
I SHALL DESTROY ALL BARRELZ!
00,02now to wait 2 hours untill cloudflare re-caches the file
TheRandomkid321 good luck
▲
▲ ▲
ah, I haven't been on EQD for a while now
▲
▲ ▲
00,02Meanwhile, tri-fail on my screen
Funkballs: scp is good for command line, to upload a file,folder or download a file/folder - sftp is good for interactive use or multiple file upload/download change permissions etc.
LAWL!
Your screen is irrelevant.
any thing that isn't related to an elephant is irrelephant
well shit guys http://i.imgur.com/UNHcT.png what should I choose?
▲
▲ ▲
majora's mask
Newfoals can't triforce
me says
Hush Jim
00,02CrimsonPhoenix, jpg because png is a bit large for this kinda image
I need to see it on Phases screen
shana: yeah I see that now. What misled me was the winscp client for windows which actually defaults to sftp for just about everything.
Meanwhile can't triforce? O_o
CrimsonPhoenix: if you haven't played majoras mask then that
CrimsonPhoenix:super mario kart :3
CrimsonPhoenix one of the games i giess
00,02or a better png compressor
▲
well it's hyperdesktop so heh
00,02CrimsonPhoenix, i'd say majoras mask
^
Funkballs: yeah I think the name winscp is there for historical reasons, e.g. before sftp existed
And that one is denied by the message blocker.
I use scp from the command line but I guess I never noticed it didn't hand't anything bu file transfers.
Meeeeeeeeeh.
listen to the man with the highlighted text CrimsonPhoenix
*handle anything but
00,02CrimsonPhoenix, if you've played it i'd get the posters
Straisin, I know I'm just sayan
Oh well, guess Phase4 is forever unforced.
00,02lol Meanwhile
http://knowyourmeme.com/photos/343214-60s-spider-man
00,02that single triangle is in the right place for a triforce i think
and I have played Majora mask before but haven't completed it. I did however watch the whole game
CrimsonPhoenix, oh xD
hello
00,02ohai
CrimsonPhoenix well which one do you want
hey SEGAdude hows your day been
I must say I' kinda tempt to get the playing cards
Allo SEGAdude
then again still unsure
crappy
stupid
kill worthy
they made another "where the hell is matt"?
CrimsonPhoenix: Get the posters!
/me Sees SEGAdude's nic and the *SEGA* sound from the genesis days plays in their head
Straisin: Yeah, 2012, we watched it earlier
nnnuuuuuhh
CrimsonPhoenix well most of those games are from before i started gaming so i never had the chance to play them so sorry
Jim: curses, I guess I came in late
alexxm, play them they're great
you should definately check it out, it is beautiful
...okay except for return of samus and Mario vs Donkey Kong
I'd like to learn how to code too Q_Q, and will do Jim
To be fair, OoT is fairly ugly with current generations
CrimsonPhoenix i will if i can find them for a realtily cheap price
Just emulate~
▲
YARR HARR FIDDLE DE DEE
▲▲
ok
00,02Straisin, download python, go on the internet and start learning
CrimsonPhoenix is a parrot
being a pirate is allright to be!
a lite one
SQUAK!
00,02or ruby, people recomend ruby but i'm yet to learn it
I like python.
Phase4: thanks, I've managed to get my hands on a few C++ books, but I'll give that a shot too
/me is away: I'm off doing other things; most likely sleeping or eating.
I have looked at ruby, its a neat language but its documentation really sucks
Now see that's Newfoals can't Triforce.
I don't like, dowanload 360 games and burn them in cds then play them on a modded xbox 360
also there are tons more libraries for python
Python is nice as it teaches you good tabbing habits
Good afternoon Bronystate!!!
c++ is a bit heavy on the memory management stuff for a beginner I think
heya MadSurge
00,02Straisin, c++ is probably not where you want to start
can I post link to song I made?
Java is nice to start out too
I got some good finds today :)
00,02do a bit in an easier language, once you have the basic concepts you can start c++
learn OO stuff
Hallo
http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/masonry/000/332/257/704.gif
Phase4, gotcha
Allo MadSurge
Phase4: Want another crazy video? This one is more of a YTMPV though with a music... :P
Spiderman is best pony
actually... theres a really good interactive learn to program site...
python has got some nice functinal programming stuff :)
hey random strangers from internets
hey FairysHuff and MadSurge hows your day been
teaches you javascript but is really good...
00,02i'm thinking bed
LOL
hang on lemmie see if I can find it
hey Eleanor hows your day been
Phase4: Sounds good too XD
Allo Meanwhile, Straisin, alexxm and FairysHuff!
Lawl Spiderman
Vordox, YTPMV are always with music
fluttershy was stomping spiderman XD
alexxm Meh. Been in a bad mood all day cause of lack of sleep.
http://tinyurl.com/72qxg29 me singing a seapony version of "Strawberry Fields" titled Strawberry Seas
fluttershy wins fatality
00,02shana, pull from bitbucket, make sure your up to date
Well I'll link it once Phase goes to bed. :9
http://codeyear.com/ - they send you interactive things to teach you how to code. It's really good.
Phase4: you're*
00,02shana, also can you quickly check the url change doesn't break linux?
Phase4: oki I'm on it
00,02Meanwhile, its 2:10, i can say your all i want :P
still streaming Phase4 far out
00,02d3rb, none of the other streamers are awake/avaliable
Phase4: Given the context of the spelling error, saying that I'm all you want could be taken the wrong way.
Funkballs: I've been trying out http://www.codecademy.com, but it isn't providing much new information to me so far
This one will probably make you go tired, Phase4 XD
lazy bastards
00,02Meanwhile, fair enough
Recommend you see it before going to bed, and hope you like Eminiem
Straisin: yeah that codeyear thing is the same as codeacademy
you're may be the correct way to say your but you dont even need to do it...
Phase4: Of course, if I /am/ all you want I'll be sure to visit in your dreams. :P
it's a program they run I think
Found Talking Cadence, CMC Flower Friends & 3 blind bags - Talking Cadence according to my sources isnt expected for another month ^_^
great for beginners
SO I HEARD CADANCE IS IN S3!!!!
Funkballs: aha, I probably just haven't gotten far into the course to get new information then
Vordox: I listened to Eminem back when he was Slim Shady *hipster glasses*
00,02o_O
I haven't found much new info for me there either to be honest but if you hadn't programmed anything before I'd think it would be pretty useful
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up
Vordox, source
/me sits down
No.
Still no Toys R Us exclusives though
YEs I'm gonna continue posting random images taht involve spiderman and ponys... problem? http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/masonry/000/310/832/740.png

Sonic the name
Hello everypony! who is airing?
00,02which it did in record time today
Phase4: it works fine
TheRandomkid321: No problem, I enjoy spiderponies
Funkballs: I've learnt a bit of things from http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/, but I'm just trying to get the very basics of coding down atm
Speed is my game
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ3zu6jHGm0 <--- The last video I recommend for you. :P It's completely random and VERY VERY Bad video. XD BUt hey! Challenges, mister Phase4 !(Also last video I put here during stream.... Kick me after :P)

There we go.
WindWhistler: that, I understand :D
Yay.
MadSurge RaveBrony stay away from any Angry Birsds news you will every see... this company thinks (and thats an actual statement by them) that they will be as big as Disney in a few years
I get interrupted so often I often have a minor fit every time it happens.
really Lil_B
Lil_B: Wtf!?! Roflmao! :D
For whatever reason It decided to remove the spaces on the first line.
Lil_B: Pfffffft...

http://images.4chan.org/v/src/1341673337931.png <-- Have a Cirno.
XD
What's a Cirno? .-.
They have made like what 7 angry birds games? But it is addicting ill give em that
/me shrugpony
EspyLacopa: That can't be Cirno...where's her wings? And why are her eyes red?
Cirno is a touhou thing.
EspyLacopa: but that's the girl from Evangalion o__o
never played angry birds. is it a flash game?
And she doesn't have a bow in her hair.
^_^
I don't find Angry Birds addicting at all, it's alright to do if you have nothing else to do
I knew it! It's not Cirno.
MadSurge: That's the joke.
Wow. That's one vertical screengrab area
What dari said.
MadSurge the following Products are eather in the making or already out (mostly in China, but officially from them): Angry Birds Cooking Books, Angry Birds Anime, Angry Birds Blushys angry Birds Animated Movies, T-Shirts aand everything else but video games
Ohai
Meanwhile: it's a popular Touhou character
MadSurge: Great. What's Touhou?
MadSurge: SHE.
I beg to differ, the computer version sucks but the smart phone versions are addicting
Meanwhile: A very popular Japanese game series.
It's a shmup.
WindWhistler: Oh ok then.
:I
WindWhistler: Mmm bullet hells
Touhou. . .bullet hell games.
WindWhistler: It's one letter, no big deal :D
umm a Deathtrap named ship?
MadSurge: You said "it".
Hello everybody
Aw
Damn it's up already.
/me noms on Sumica

Lil_B how do they expect anime and animated movies the games don't have that much of a story
Morning fumbles
You know what it would be awesome to see? Mecha rockets. Just a big giant onion-shaped Rocket that's one stage away from revealing a humanoid robot with a command module for a head.

TOmbstones version is better.. MY OPINION!

Tombstone got to dance with Tara Strong, lucky basterd
LOL
i like both versions
ACtually this version aint really that bad... They are both REALLY different
Wow, I am jelly

:$
Did you guys know that the living tomb stone is jewish?
Oh hell no, Kerbals....
i thought he was russian
What difference does that make?
why does that matter Sir_Brony ?
http://memecrunch.com/image/4edbbd461861334a2c000000.jpg
Sir_Brony Not surpising... He is Isreali.
It's just an interesting piece of trivia
Could this possibly work
My god... what are you doing
Golakka: life
this will work
Not insulting any isrealis am I? Is that the right word?
/me digs giant rockets.
That things look a beached orca.
This will not fly :D
this looks like it could survive
TheRandomkid321, I like this one better because it gives the Discord feel much better AND it's the original
I didn't know he was Jewish, but I don't see how that matters
atleast in my experience of classic KSP :d
(and I'm a sucker for originals)
Needs more vertical surface tbh
i thought TheLivingTombstone was Russian :O:O:O
Im a sucker for remixes
stone
CrimsonPhoenix: same
It looks like a killer whale got knocked up by a space shuttle.

/me like planes, not trains
8-bit ponies! :3
CUPCAKES
good morning you cheese eating surrendering monkies
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6m9w4BRQz1r4o7zbo1_500.png?.jpg
CrimsonPhoenix: It... it happened!
Vordox I'm happy that cute mark turned out so well, it was the most work
Trains are ok
No... :(
Equestria is in Africa
o.o' CUPCKAES
NOOOOOOOOO! :O
is this real 8-bit? doesn't really sound like it
SeaponiesofLiverpool: :O
Pinkie pie cupcakes at wal mart? not sure if want...
Hey Dken2021. Hey are yo useeing poeple in Wisconsin only eat dairy products? -_-
I see, nice.
*you saying
DR_Fulbles: dont think so
What are the cupcakes made of..?
Ponies47 I was talking about the french...
Rainbow Dash?
YES
Dken2021: Oh. Ok then. :P
YOU ARE CORRECT
Yuck
Lil_B, the same cutie mark as SuperBrony64?
Well, they might taste like Skittles, actually
Wow. Dash is still cute even in 8 bit voice form.
i hate pinkie pie for that ):<
nope, this definately is not 8-bit
Wtf
lol
xD
Something already exploded?
CrimsonPhoenix I know he has something N64 releated as well, but I have never seen his fully
good sign
there was already an explosion?
it's a full N64 controller
XD
There goes the tail.
Ooh watcha say...
it's crashin, it's wailing
HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN TO MEEEEEE
cup of flour, little bit of sweet not sour, a pinch of salt, just a bit more than a teaspoon of vanilla
Lol
CrimsonPhoenix well... I have a 2/3 controller XD
that was an interesting flip
dat Swedish
R.I.P Kerbals
e cupcakes are made up
f
that auto-tune
Did the jet exhaust burn off part of the tail perhaps?
*of
ded
then again it fits the theme
what could possibly go wrong/
?
That can only end well.
this is good idea
MOAR POWER!
There goes the tail again.
Omnom black pudding.
BOOM
WHAT THE FU *boom*
BANG
see, success!
oh god
OH HOLY MOTHER OF ROCKET SHIPS
Plane: UMad? :D
I just got back wow
welcome back Sir_Brony
wb Sir_Brony :)
Is this Basshunter?
Think so
My guess is that the jet exhaust burns off the tail. That, or the stress from the acceleration burns it off
cause it sounds like his style...
Thanks but wow, those poor kerbals
it's swedish atleast
Sir_Brony no worries, they were paid for this job
Lolnope
boom
not only it's swedish but the beat and all, it has a basshunter feel
Ded
They don't pay them enough
That didn't end well...
To run, one must first learn to crawl. And to get to space, one must first die horribly in a giant fireball.
now that you mention it phoenix your right they do
which is da sun
XD
Nyst: But then how do they get to space when they are dead?
11,02Yay for poniez ^-^

I never managed to get to the Mun :( I could make a rocket that'd fly out far enough, but it would always be in a different place.
Sir_Brony: Aww why are you sad? :(
Ee'yup
Jim those poor children
Chrysalis: Well played.
Whoa...
it's only a matter of time before they run out of kerbal adults

Chrysalis: that made me laugh, good find.
Hey gusy, I'm only gonna be able to stay for a few minutes but what's up?
AttacktheAndalite: Genocide!
not much, you?
if you watched heroes in the past few days, what episode did you leave off on?
Question: can you detach parts in airplane mode the way you can in rocket mode?
Alright I feel better now.
rave-tail is full of party
hmm, network seems jittery as of late
Jim: Genocide? Whut/
So many thrusters
Because I wonder if you could make a rocket that starts out with wings, launches horizontally, and then pulls up and throws off it's wings.
Kerbals are being murdered
as usual
Ahh.
Turns out I just had to vomit... and it went EVERYWHERE
Hello everypony,how is everyone doing? :)

Back... I was watching pedies cleverbot video
Oh hold that thought
/me waves at Dken2021 ,Jim , MegaMoonShine ,Sir_Brony and AttacktheAndalite

Whoa it barely cleared the pad.
Is it just me or is the game lagging?
it's his pc
Just a little
The game can really take it out of a pc.
^_^ I can has a dino park with RC3 - by the way...doesn anypony want to visit my theme park? :P
That it can
My pc isn't terrible but it suffers from this game (the demo)
Alright I think I'm good now
Probably in the same way DF murders computers, not in graphics but in all the calculations.
Those are some giant wings...
Mmm, DF
Oh man that plane looks cool.
