Hello SirGanjalf n Texasboykc09 :)
/me 08,01hopes that message was not truncated
Dat wall of text
08,01good!
thats a bit of short notice ;)
:o
08,01aye, i only found out yesterday, and i've been trying to arrange something since then
lol
08,01we've got some cool stuff planned
and I'm guessing "Don't spoil this or I'll gut you", like always?
08,01yes! if anyone breathes a word about this to either of them, i will go on a killing spree
08,01starting with you and your family
:D
wont Wr3k know about this message?
08,01Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: nope, i just kicked him ^.^
O_O
lol
:D
Why are we watching this?
05well that was uneccesary
theres probably going to be a lot of explaining after this xD
Grimrock...
08,01hi wrek! <3
Wrek: but it was funny
Friendly kick <3
Mod Fight? xD
^
we were seeing if you were actually paying attention to the stream...
we felt a tad bit lonely
^
^^
^^^
and he goes back to his game... and ignoring us...
:D
I don't blame him
08,01dat flakey internet gabbygums
It looks pretty cool
but he is providing entertainment for us, so I guess that works
SirGanjalf: Loot makes this addicting
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Ah yes, me like loot:P
Kinda regret now that i haven't bought it yet. Oh, well, maybe there will be another discount
I was hoping the community choice was going to be oblivion for $5, but that didn't happen :(
1 percent off
^ D:
lol friendly fire
hehe, stupid armors
if you aren't getting exp for those, you might want to actually try killing them instead...
PonyNegZero: he'll get overwhelmed
he should be able to handle 2
naw
he should have been able to kill the last one himself, easily
...
the game's flipping out
Dude...
Collective dream? Dungeoception!(had to be done)
:D
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: imagine if dropping them down just makes them appear later in the game - that would be really funny
hi everyone
yeah, "funny"
Hi Lil_B!
hi Lil_B
:)
hi Lil_B
ello Lil_B
hello Lil_B
Hello Lil_B.
SirGanjalf: I would find it pretty funny
^
SNAILS:O
and Twi_Fi and Texasboykc09 :)
howdy, Lil_B!
hi Sylandest
Sup Lil_B /)
I think I was right...
How are things Lil_B?
(\ MegaMoonShine
MadSurge frustraiting :/
Lil_B: how so?
I got my MIDI to USB Cable, but it won't register my Keyboard
Lil_B: are you sure the driver for the keyboard is booting properly?
(I do this for the first time and have no Idea how its supposed to work, there iare no instructions and I found no answers online)
08,01i just received an e-mail from the Principle of the University of St Andrews (where I currently work and study) saying that our Head of Computer Science has been promoted to Dean of Sciences
08,01and it included a picture of him, thus: http://imgur.com/4ERj9
PonyNegZero its an older keyboard (around 8 years) I didn't saw any driver installations though...
08,01i am seriously considering e-mailing back saying "My god, man, WHERE ARE HIS EYES?"
yeah scince!
*Science
08,01and sent.
he probably blinked during the photo xD
Looks like Brock got older
It's Brock's father
who's streaming?
Wrek is pony_7007
oh... "Rocko=Brock in the german version appearently...)
well, looks like I have to get a new mini keyboard afterll...
What's Wrek playing?
its better anyway because I don't have much space and I can play it directly infront of the screen XD
Texasboykc09: Legends of Grimrock
Lil_B: If I had to take a guess, it would be that your computer doesn't have an appropriate driver, so it is ignoring it
PonyNegZero thats probably it, but I really have no Idea how I should fix this
08,01also, because i forgot to say before, the festivities will be commencing at 9pm UTC tomorrow (Thursday). Adjust for your own timezone.
08,01
08,01pm me if you don't know what i'm talking about
I mailed my like 2 month ago... wait for wre k too?
08,01Lil_B: this is something different
08,01it's wrek and luna's birthday tomorrow
Lil_B: Lil_sorry, I don't know anything about what you have, so I can't be too helpful... but good luck, I guess.
and Wrek is gone again XD
08,01Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: i kicked him again
PonyNegZero thanks anyways :)
:D
ok, afk working on an E-Mail :)
you killed my babies
already got messages made for Wrek, and Luna Individually
:)
/me 08,01nuzzles Unnr
/me hates running errands
double kill
05gotta love runnign out of antivenom
oh, finally I got a Bronystate Newsletter again after 4 weeks XD
and Wrek is back
Wrek: gotta love not paying attention to IRC until you die~
Wrek: but we still love you anyhow
he cant hear you lol
05well i love this game so far
05gettin' emerged :3
cool
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: ha, he might have read it
Don't you mean immersed, Wrek? :P
ol
05whatever
lol
just looked up The seven Samurai on IMDb too see when it was made... they are making a remake in 2014 T.T the horror
Lil_B: ppl are running out of ideas, its sad
Wrek be dying lots
Lil_B: Remake EVERYTHING
Lil_B: Wait what? Noooo.
Vordox: he's probably glad that this isn't a true roguelike - no saves...
Well, lets just hope a Citizen Kande remake is in the works... because why not...
Kane*
Lil_B: D: NOOO
Lol spider bugged
08,01http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&id=2675#comic
whats being streamed?
I accedently my Desktop... all the letters on my Files are now Transparent...
We'll call the Citizen Kane remake Rosebud and make it from the point of view of (censored for those who don't know who/what/where Rosebud is). It'll be the best remake ever!
Yeah, interesting O___0
08,01i know mathematicians who are exactly like that
08,01and physicists...
bucking hate random dc's
08,01Unnr: trye
08,01*true
/me points an accusning hoof at the re-use of letters in E&M
08,01OH GOD
08,01YES
all i see is an empty channel
08,01and omegas...
08,01omegas everywhere...
08,01i call the small ones wobble-yus.
I love math and science humor. I tend to get most of it.
When it was said I am the Alpha and the Omega, they really meant the end of the world was gonna happen when a physicist ran out of ways to use the omega.
/me is gunna take a shower
Anyway, I should probably try to sleep for a little bit if I'm gonna try to get one of those portal guns...here's hoping it comes up as close to 11:00 (2 hours from now) as possible...lol
Rubberfruit's back on youtube!
Tries to give PonyNegZero change for the omega, all I got its a ϕ and a ψ
Unnr: Ω is 234
Mfw annoying orange has a fucking tv show: :|
08,01ω <-- wobble-yu
08,01that's a small omega
PonyNegZero: don´t use windows altcodes >.>
08,01Ω is a capital omega
ælll righty then!
Pinkies4thWall: Tobuscus is on it. Everything has been solved
Unnr: I had to use it for physics...
08,01we used Ω for lower complexity bounds in computer science
I lost a LOT of respect
08,01O is upper complexity bound
what a alt code
08,01when Ω and O are equal, it's said to be a tight complexity bound, or ϕ
08,01Unnr: it's an upper bound of polynomial time
08,01but it gets complicated, depending on how fast your function grows...
08,01O(n^x) can be a better complexity than O(x^n), when n in the former is low, and n in the latter is high
Unnr: punctuation is important - "Go eat, grandma" and "Go eat grandma" are very different
08,01there will be a crossover point, but before that, you're better using the former (exponential) algorithm
PonyNegZero: *nods*
PonyNegZero: i lol'd when i agreed
08,01Unnr: ha! yes, i love that
05feck
bogosort is best sort!
Its the troll sort
08,01one of my favourites is Spaghetti Sort
Quick_Thinker: the bogo sort is a way of sorting elements that roughly says
take elements, shuffle around at random, check to see if they are in the order you want
08,01because you can only use it on physical objects, or simulations of such
if not, repeat
08,01liek psaghetti
okay so sorting the elments form the periodic table or sometihng like that
08,01*spaghetti
the classic example of bogosorting is take a deck of cards and shuffle. if not completely in order, reshuffle.
ddid i pronounce that right?
Mmm, spaghetti :D
i take it i will bogosorting in senior or junior year?
im a sophmore now
last night, i walked in to where m roommate was sitting, said, "I'm eating yogurt", and he giggled for 15 minutes
speaking about music... what should I listen too now... Donkey Kong or Dragonforce :/
Whenever life makes me sad, I just remember that ISO 3103 exists
^ waht?
Quick_Thinker: Are you familliar with the idea of an ISO standard?
no
I would have never thought you could have drama on Minecraft. MINECRAFT.
im a high school student
RobertRevenge: wrong
PonyNegZero: Half of the staff of the server I'm on quit because of stupid arguments last night. Meaning they're going to fill the positions with globbing idiots due to lack of time to weed out the bad seeds. :/
RobertRevenge: sounds about right...
08,01Lil_B: oh yeah, i was meaning to get back to you about that; i enjoyed it, and have some constructive criticism for you
ISO is the International Organazation for Standardization, they spend their time defining basic measures of most everything.
08,01bug me abotu it later
ISO 3103 is " Tea -- Preparation of liquor for use in sensory tests"
08,01Quick_Thinker: wikipedia is your friend
08,01Unnr: that is amazing
/me 08,01loves tea
guys, do any of you enjoy saying typos phonetically?
08,01in fact, i think it's time for a pot
Pinkies4thWall: Indeed I do.
Pinkies4thWall: I do! :D
:)
"...and of the liquor with or without milk or both." I would like my teas both with and without Milk please
Pinkies4thWall: One of my favorites is Hlep. It makes me giggle. :)
05OH WELL
RobertRevenge: I giggled too
05damend spiders and their poison attack
That death sound.
needs more wilhelm scream...
^
08,01Pinkies4thWall: spaghetti sort
08,01it uses physical principles to sort
08,01so you can only sort physical objects
08,01or simulations of suh
For those who like sounding out typos phonetically, do you like typing them out syllable for syllable, as you would in a dictionary?
What's the most typos anyone's ever seen in one word?
:( dead chat
did i miss anything important?
<_<
>_>
^_^
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: not really
kay
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: pudding
Pinkies4thWall: þudding?
Unnr: is that an alt code at the beginning of that word?
can't tell
nope, that's a þ as in, every rose has its þ
/me is hopelessly confuzzled
the Þ or þ (read: thorn) is a letter used in several old languages and modern icelanding
icelandic
/me will now eat yogurt
it sounds like th in the wold thick
/me wishes he knew a European language. Maybe German or Swedish, possibly French
/me has smuckers. u jelly/
*?
I'm not sure if that's a pun
That's a pun.
Pinkies4thWall: no. I'm jam
:D
I need to find a good place to meet some female bronies. Too bad there isn't anywhere around here like that.
RobertRevenge: remember, there are no girls on the internet [jk, there are a few]
RobertRevenge: I like making people happy, but as I am male, I fail you. :(
PonyNegZero: I consider 90% of people on the internet male until proven otherwise.
RobertRevenge: does your geographical territory have a brony facebook page?
Like, mine is utah bronies
Pinkies4thWall: Not that I know of.
RobertRevenge: my tf2 clan has a 2 females - one is a regular, one is an alt
C'mon Wrek, you got this!
I just don't get girls
wat?
Pinkies4thWall: I totally get girls, but that's mainly because I'm a really effiminate guy.
Lol
disregard females, aquire mares?
TREE
PonyNegZero: Disregard females, acquire Vidya gaems
PonyNegZero: Oh glob, I don't think I want mares
Problem is, you can't pass your seed on with video games alone.
PonyNegZero: They aren't technicolored in real life
/me rode a 19 year old mare yesterday. her name is QT. http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m77ys7DmgX1rv2re5o1_1280.jpg
D'aww
RobertRevenge: they can be with a little spraypaint...
Pinkies4thWall: cool
/me just realized how out of context that can go
PonyNegZero: But..but.. No magic. No parties. They're just horses. D;
BTW, mom took up her computer so I'm back on my sometimes-dead, sometimes-working old computer. I'm using my other nick because she might get onto the internet from somewhere else, such as a hospital or her workplace.
RobertRevenge: for fun, I know a family who owns horses and they dyed one of them... I think dark blue... (she was going to get shaved for the summer, so they just thought it would be fun)
/me wants to obtain horse, make natural coat color pink, and party like a baus
^ :D
so....whats this vid about???
PonyNegZero, let me guess: the dye got onto her skin?
Geneticists, we demand technicolor ponies!
shuddup: Wrek is playing some sort of game
RobertRevenge: Fuck that.
I want a T Rex.
^
Well, that calls for a horse of a different color!
Now.
Kandarihu|Buddybear: I don't believe so
i wanna ride a sabertooth lion
Hey
I demand a giant yellow chicken to ride around on like a baws :<
dari, i've always wondered. Why blue text?
just because, or what?
The dinosaur of course
And as for text colour
It was probably just a random choice
I don't really remember
I used to use different colours though
oh.
i liek random

Wrek: Throw a rock on it.
ITS A TRAP
RobertRevenge: if it were me, i'd join the largest one if it's the largest by a big margin
Pinkies4thWall: I did, about 350 in the largest. The rest are about 40-50 per group.
RobertRevenge: yeah, Utah bronies has over 500 members

NO SPOILERS
Wait wut?

ohai Everlasting_Joy
Hey Pinkies4thWall|xbox!
saturday's MLP eps on hub is Super squeezy 9000 and fall weather friends
Stop falling Wrek :P
Wrek: I hope you realise you're killing your team doing that
Oh god
This puzzle
I stopped playing this game at this point.
what is 2+2?
SeaponiesofLiverpool: Hey guess what
SeaponiesofLiverpool: "ME3 will have 3 totally different endings" <--- Rumour/Hype
What happeend?
3 different endings
Wrek: You have to step on certain switches in an order to get the right teleports to the next room
SeaponiesofLiverpool: Heard of Peter Moleneux?
TRAP
with a hardline definition of the word "ending"
oh Wrek is still streaming, thought he stopped
rockytoppie85: Stream is backz 0P
oh goodiez
LOL TRAPED
meaning the VERY end
Riiiiight SeaponiesofLiverpool . <.< 3 endings
SO WHAT IF YOU WERE COLOURBLIND?
=P
welp
<--- Can't see Red so good at all
So I see only 2 endings
colorblind =/= blind
lol
Yep, I can tell he's getting pissed at this. I did
/me hugs Vordox
shades of gray?
I always hate those impossible puzzles. Though hot dog is it satisfying when they are finished.
hi Vordox
Hai Pinkies4thWall|xbox
ME3 will have 3 endings but the entire games text will be an Comic sans
what is this?
so what is this? it looks familiar....
u know who would make an AWESOME book narrator for 50 shades of Gray?
Everlasting_Joy: The most ANNOYING part about this puzzle is, there's a puzzle on the next floor, that if you fail it, you have to do this one again
is this that game someone told me about... was it magika?
Foghorn Leghorn
Very_Silly_Filly: :O That's sadistic.
Ikr
That alone made me quit the game
rockytoppie85: nooope
Foghorn Leghorn should totally narrate 50 Shades of Gray
nethack is sadistic...

Bronysith: Kool-Aid man, who needs a wrecking crew?

http://cheezburger.com/6434332672 steam summer sale in a nutshell
Very_Silly_Filly: Why?
Bugger knows
Lol brony-FOREVER
lol Bronysith
Very_Silly_Filly: and what is green fanta :P
My friend smuggled some in from Egypt and I had a swag
I need it!
Tasted really nice
Greenfanta is apple flavour
makes no sense why it would be banned....
I'mma google it
okay tell me why :D
08,01can i just remind everyone that even officially released info about S3 *still* counts as spoilers
08,01and spoilers are a permaban
Very_Silly_Filly: I'm sure we've had that around here before... might've been apple Lucozade though. :S
Bronysith yup, so true
anywho. i best be going to new vegas
got to destroy more legion assholes
Bronysith: Watch out for the radiation!
who the hell do they think they are, crucifying people like that
people are finally talking
GilDash: Ohai didn't see you there :D
Big shiny crystal!
killerpony7733: Tsk, pay attention! :p
GilDash: Was watching something on youtube :P
killerpony7733: Do tell. :)
Is there actually something streaming or is Chrome going stupid on me again? :S
hey guys
Howdy alexxm!
GilDash: There is a stream on with legends of grimrock
killerpony7733: Bloody Chrome messing me up. :D
hey Everlasting_Joy how've you been
Well, I guess it's time to keep an eye on Zap2It for any mentions of a S3 premier. When I can get back on my mom's computer, I'm gonna pin an app-tab on my Firefox.
i took the pony test. according to about 3 i am applejack. Just that i used to have the slightest bit of an accest and that i come from a long line of farmers 'doesnt mean no think no how :3
alexxm: Getting some events set into motion and planing today out :).
rthing*
what events are these Everlasting_Joy
ohai alexxm
cant type today D:
hey OtakuTom how've you been
alexxm: My Xbox X-Traveganza.
Hey OtakuTom!
really really tired...lol
Bronies, bronies everywhere :3
Hey ponies
I'm back with dinner
ello Very_Silly_Filly
Well, tea
Since it's 5:21
/me hugs Pinkies4thWall|xbox
dinner!? its 12:21 in the- oh ya your in england :P
08,01i believe the S3 premiere is on September 15th
Everlasting_Joy: :3
usosilly
08,01that's just what i read on wikipedia a while ago
but thats so far away.
rockytoppie85: new york? mass?
Couldn't you tell by the dialect?
Pinkies4thWall|xbox: what?
rockytoppie85: where do you live?
GilDash: All I did was Fluttershy "Yaey"
Very_Silly_Filly: Well... your name sums you up perfectly. :D
/me lives in riverton, ut
Derpy= "Special Edition Pony" :D. I know, I know.
ohai #bronystate :3
*Utah
Wait, is Wrek's magic guy called Pootis?
08,01aw man, derpy's sold out already
ohai ekips
08,01i really *really* want one
Very_Silly_Filly: He is! :D
how you doing ekips
a derpy what?
Yea, as soon as I saw that link, I jumped on it hoping it was still available...lol
Really, really really really
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2230398/
THERE EVERYWHERE D:
08,01Very_Silly_Filly: cheapest i found was £60 inc p&p
xD
ded
Exactly :c
ded
08,01i'm very tempted to actually pay that...
why do i keep hearing loud beeping noises o_o
The way I see S3's air date, it wlll be what it will be.
Well, lightIRC responds to CTCP requests as any IRC client honestly has to. So I know that Rocky is in ET. But that doesn't narrow things down much.
08,01i hope the premiere is mid-august...
YES!!!! I GOT IT!!!
Everlasting_Joy : when will it be on?
I'm hoping it's mid-September to be honest.
RainBowJack: I don't know.
Kandarihu|Buddybear: Stop trying to find out were i live with your fancy mathmatics :P
Mid august
i tought i would be september
08,01woah, derpies are selling for $200 on ebay...
Wrek: They're still ded
jesus
derpie dolls?
hm, could 5cm per second be considered as A or B movie?
i mean... not dolkls im sry D:
08,01rockytoppie85: no, official derpy toys
RainBowJack: There's a new video/article saying it could be next August, but I honestly don't know nor care. It will air when it airs, and that's all I care about.
An A film is a high budget high rating film
08,01the comiccon ones
the toy thingys with the hair?
A B film are the lower budget still kinda popular ones
08,01derpy madness
08,01rockytoppie85: aye
oh
well Everlasting_Joy i dont care either but i am so excited to get a season 3
My Neice has bloody Rarity
I might steal it :3
I don't know the budget of 5cm per second...it's got a 7.9 rating on imdb though
Ohhh! This game
i luv this game :D
so how far into the game is this
RainBowJack: The better question is, who isn't?
rockytoppie85, sorry.
its like in the start
Kandarihu|Buddybear: Its okay :D
i think everypony is ^^
thanks Majestic_Sparkler
08,01http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Comic-Con-2012-Exclusive-Derpy-Hooves-in-box-/170880662106?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item27c947fa5a#ht_1258wt_1398
Holy crap...I think I refreshed the page at just the right time...I just bought one of the replica P-body portal guns and when I went back to the product page, it says it's not available again.
Fucking hell, 180 pounds byout
Maybe not...the buy now button's back.
08,01rockytoppie85: yes
i assume the floating blue rock can't be good
want something?
alexxm: It's a restoration rock
The blue rock is like a save point
Heals your parpty
yes.
thanks Very_Silly_Filly
08,01rockytoppie85: nope!
What, a roguelike with a "restoration rock" pshhh
ould get that derpy.... but for 200? who decided that!?
PonyNegZero: Don't underestimate this game
yet the highest bid is like 20
It's still retarded
rockytoppie85: That's the art of flipping.
greedy people
Very_Silly_Filly: if there is a game harder than nethack, I'd be surprised...
08,01PonyNegZero: IWTBTG
08,01nethack is actually playable
Wow...I think it really did go out of stock in like 5 minutes...I really did refresh the page at just the right time...lol
And i would NEVER get it from ebay. one time i got a harry potter poster..... and i waited till october.... OF 2010 ITS STILL NOT HERE! ergh i hate ebay noa.
scammers
08,01rockytoppie85: did you get your money back?
Olol, there's atually a muffin on the box
rockytoppie85: Then tell them to give the money back
^
Very_Silly_Filly: Its been 2 years...
And?
I've never had a problem with buying stuff from ebay. You just have to look at the seller feedback.
If they don't. then there's nothing youcan do about it
08,01the thing i like about ebay is that if you *do* get scammed, it's relatively easy to reclaim your money
08,01ach well
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4684/
Oop
Oppse
Oopsie.
Yea, if you don't get your item, you make a claim with ebay and they follow up on it. It's a personal rule of mine to never leave feedback on any item I purchase until I actually get it.
if only i could go to commic con.
that rainbow dash face looks wierd
:D?
no from the site up there

Alchemist: Here is some running music
Suddenly sexy ponies.
Vordox, Great pic
Lil_B: same
/me is so freaking sleeepy
BronyInstrumental, I can't play the most basic songs
BronyInstrumental: But isn't it a bitch to play on Guitar Hero? That means it MUST be hard to play on a real guitar, right? D:
GabeMoist Why are you moist?
FairysHuff, it's my super power
FairysHuff: because he's not dry
I used to be a pro at guitar hero
CK|Catnap it is a bitch on GH but either i'm good at guitar or the song is just not hard IRL cuz it's simple
GabeMoist aaaaah. Thankyou for clearing that up ^_^
for me at least
i sometimes played on the hardest difficulty, BUFFER WHY!?
right timiing
BUFFER
Ponies became metal without stopping being cute! Awesome job Lauren!
i wanna see the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny with ponies now
I like it when online shops Overprizes Stuff that isn't out yet because they have no official Numbers XD (every WiiU Game on Amazon is 79.99 XD)
Mortal Pony Kombat?
ponies and metal makes bronystate can't handle all the awesomeness, that's why buffer
ANIMALITY!

Suddenly, Vivi
DJNilla: <3
HEY EVERYPONY! :p
DJNilla Moist Sparkle.
rockytoppie85 episodes are usually played on a livestream stream
Ponies47 Holla

Eulshy: probably a draw, because of love and tolerance being a common theme :D
hi DJNilla ;)
Eulshy: There are some I believe
/me nuzzles DJNilla.
hi Ponies47
Later everypony :)
I can just imagine what would happen if a parent were to force his/her child to diligently practice at the electric guitar from a young age like some parents force their children to practice at the violin. The kid is basically destined from then on to become a speed-guitarist.
bye MegaMoonShine
Bye MegaMoonShine
00,03NO DJNilla! DON'T LOOK AT THE STREAM!
laters MegaMoonShine
Kandarihu|Buddybear: what about the electric violin?

valoreins: looks better than all of my stuff combined ;) you did a very good job, rest assured :$
heya DJNilla~ :)
CountDoofus: lol thx
GabeMoist That awkward and annoying moment when your talking but no one is paying attention so you feel ignored and hurt.
Dragonforce are kind of a one-trick pony, but they make awesome music :D
PonyNegZero, I'm talking about guitar playing that takes an entire childhood to master. And I honestly doubt that these living legends of the guitar practiced several hours every day from the age of four.
06c:
Madsurge:Cool.

I'm getting worried about S3. It's not going to be running in August. And apparently, there's no confirmation that it's even going to be September. They told EQD that they "hope" to have it out by the end of 2012. To me, that implies that not even that's set in stone.
Lol
OOooo

good to hear yifle1
00,10Well if that is the case nitt I will keep an eye out at frys
Today I was in some strange shops... I found an AtariST for 33€... I have no use for it but it would be fun to just own one XD
yeah i guess
I am a real fan of fluttershy http://derpy.me/cKaVi
alexxm: My day went pretty good. How about you?
NOMNOM then why are you watching it
00,10seeing as they have mother boards listed for like 90cents right now
that's good
Ok Sumica, sent it
it was on equestriadaily
Alchemist: hnnnngggggg
/me r3ecovers from heartattack
11,01Sumica: Yeah. If you're near a Frys, maybe you could ship me better parts for my PC. I can get an upgrade for less than I would pay for a replacement motherboard.
00,10yeah no kidding MadSurge. did't know steam set off a klaxon
11,01Frys online doesn't sell the parts I need though.
NOMNOM: dont bother with it. I think I know which video you are talking about.
after summer break im going to a whole new place im really nervous
Sumica: :'( I'm sorry
to morrowind
00,10it's ok MadSurge
00,10just scared the hell out of me
11,01My parts are so old, can't find them online at places like NewEgg.
Sumica: would have been scared shitless too
00,10I will check the ad this friday Nitt.
yifle1: lonewolf? ugh, that reminds me of my "friend" :| he thinks hes a lone wolf... yet he sticks with us.... us as in.....well the class it is separated... boys and girls... the girls break it- thats a different story. but, long story short, hes not my favorite person....
11,01I can find listings, but not anyway to buy it.
11,01OK Sumica.
00,10they always have big sales on the weekend
:|
00,10what parts are you looking for?
rockytoppie85> okay of course i can be woth the others in my class
this one is good too http://derpy.me/MbQXZ
11,01I need a motherboard that has a DDR2 1066 memory slot, AM 2+ CPU Slot, and at least one PCI-E slot.
...is this Amiga-like music?
11,01I couldn't find one on the website.
11,01Oldest had a AM-3.
Alchemist: dat dashie :) so cute
hmm?
11,01But didn't sell processors to fit that I could afford.
11,01I can spend $100
yifle1: want a friend? who do you know that is most like you. its best tostart of that way.... its easier to get friends on the first day, despite wbat anyone says
MadSurge what is amiga type music?
Good Afternoon Everypony :)
How long have you been saving up?
sry for bad spelling :D
Hi Cypresswolf
hai Cypresswolf
Lil_B: some notes sound like some synthetizers I heard only from that era of gaming :D
how you doing Cypresswolf
Got another pony pack in the mail :) This one's full of pony trading card packs - 20 of them
rockytoppie85 well im just a plain boring nerd who just wants to be for himself
Haio Cypresswolf
Cypresswolf: Lucky
Does anypony want to know whats inside?
MadSurge yeah, the sound effects could really be from an Amiga :/ (me didn't grew up with amig, but has a lot of Amiga music :) )
if it wasent for my ADHD i would have been a goth
Pony trading cards. One of these day the brony community will find a way to make the official trading cards into a game
yifle1: well...erm....um...er....who do you like best in the class....idk... whos the nicest?
Maybe rock paper scissors... but with cards
Lil_B: me neither, but a lot of Amiga games had really good music <3
Use the cards ase
whats going on Cypresswolf
Use the cards as markers for AR ponies, like Eye of Judgement did on PS3
rockytoppie85 well there was a boy named Jarl him and i have known each other for 11 years now
05what better way to start ones birthday than with vivis radio? :D
There are 3 designs for the pack - 1 with Applejack & Rainbow, 2 has Fluttershy & Rarity, 3 has Twilight & Pinkie
yifle1: so, he is your friend?
alexxm: Im opening up these pony trading card packs :)

Wrek: indeed <3
Let me clean off my desk first - cluttered with empty cans, bottles, and dishes from last night
Wrek, its your birthday?
rockytoppie85 of course he is my friend but we have just grown away for each other
Cypresswolf: tell us who you do get :D
oh so he is not at your school?
Wrek: Happy 41 minute early birthday
rockytoppie85 he likes to fight for fun i don´t like fighting not even for fun
:) Of Course, MadSurge - clearing desk space first
05<3
yifle1: fight? like verbal? or.... like punch punch fight?
Lil_B: at least people are stil making good videogame music :$
rockytoppie85 no just for fun he allways makes sure i dosent hurt the one he is fighting with
MadSurge Video game music today has the same quality often as other music :) but the old systhems have the nice Retro Charm :)
like roughhouse? erm... okay.... so why dont you call him every now and then?
Lil_B: indeed :)
rockytoppie85 Im bad at that
oh Wrek! i need to give you something for your b-day! but i only have tf2 items!
rockytoppie85 im not very good to hold contact with people
yifle1: okay... get somone else like that... wait how old are you/ what grade? i cant tell you mine, the site will freak again like they did last time :|
MadSurge I'm still trying to make decent chiptunes (and I have a lot of good 16-Bit samples, but all are so short and LMMS just can't stretch samples :( otherwise I would try to make SNES-like music XD

Braeburn's the reason my little brothers are hitting puberty...
Vordox: meh
MaxTheSwedishBrony: It is.
twi_sprinkle_GS17: Well you are born with it. its not a gene thing but your born with it, its when your hormones are the opposite, it is not a thing that runs through a family.
Vordox oh god it LOOPS
Meanwhile: O.o how do i remove
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEPZ-drnUKE
but the definition on art is different for everyone and based in different perceptions so it's a pointless discussion
Chrysalis: Remember, it starts small. :P
MaxTheSwedishBrony: nice Artwork man :)
MaxTheSwedishBrony: You don't. You just never do it again.
:p
Meanwhile: Allright :D!

You know what? There's a great way for us to get back at Howard Stern. Give him what he expects the least. I saw something about his pet pitbull passing away recently. Let's join him in his mourning. This is where love and tolerance can be the most lulzy.
:D
... is it just me or as MetalScream an awesome Name for a Pony?
/me is still having a hoof massage
BlazeAngel, I'll take 5
BlazeAngel: Ill take one
Ill take 10 BlazeAngel

Hold on guys! I'll run out of stock at this rate!
:(
I'll take ALL OF IT :O

If we can confirm this as true, we should just call into his show, identify ourselves as bronies, and offer condolences for his loss.
Your right Kandarihu.

Ignoring him is also a good option.

he makes fun of everyone
JESmith: Buth buh buh...
/me leaves the hoof massage for a while, starts dancing
Heh aye Sumica
Personally I'm not paying attention. The Bronycon documentary is going to disprove him anyways
JESmith: somebody needs to point out to him that there is p--n of everything, even himself
JESmith, I don't think anyone takes him seriously.

Kandarihu: A bit over 2 hours
Kandarihu: So long that one of the cameramen had a son, raised him, taught him how to use the camera, died, and had his son take over.
Uhh... Luna? You said back in April that you may need me in the future and you would contact me. Is the future when Wrek Implodes and you have no good artists left? :P

Hey Derpy_Hooves.
CountDoofus, I see.
Meanwhile, But Leon's dead...
Meanwhile: \:3/
00,10so I wonder if the cost of a steady cam would have broken this films budget.
Derpy_Hooves: \:D/ whatever this means.
\:3/ = hug?
I think it means hugs
Sumica: i think they spent all the mony on cameras
Well ok then. ^^
/me hugs Meanwhile :3
Sumica: they broke a shitton from all the shaking
/me hugs Derpy_Hooves back.
Sumica: Tripods are expensive
Sumica. I can't watch this anymore...my headache gets worse each second...
It's not like you could make a tripod out of some sticks, or something.
Setting up shots on tripods for intense combat and running would make the whole movie a much harder and longer to make.
dang that pistol whip
Oh look, a steady camera!
Like how <('.'<)'s supposed to be Kirby
FFFFFFFFFFFFFF
RARITY
00,10steady cams are not tripodmounted
BACK
Rarity does not care for your kirby impression.
00,10you put them on a person
Okay fellow ponies... :,( i had a horrible day and i need some pinkie pie smiles. Anypony got anything to link to that will make me smile?
Sumica: A tripod mount would be more steady than this. >_>
11,01What's Bourne trying to do?
THIS ISN'T SOME KIND OF MOVIE.
THIS IS REAL.
:|
Nittany_Discord: The reporter knows someone connected to his past. Or something.
11,01Assset.
00,10a 1980 camcorder would be more steady then this
True. I guess the whole reason for the shakycam has got to do with trying to establish a raw atmosphere for the movie. I see this in the new BSG and Stargate Universe iirc.
dat asssset
11,01He's going to bolt.
11,01Dead.
Damnit.

ARG's ended man
so noponys got nothing to help. awesome :<
I also see this in more recent video and computer games, too. Let's face it guys. Shakycam is in fashion.
11,01pony_245024: Help with what?
London?
00,10he wants happy pictures Nittany_Discord
Kandarihu: And it's fine, when it's done well and where it belongs.
11,01Happy pictures?
When it's in every single scene, it's just awful to watch.
00,10yup
pony_245024: What happened? D:
I need some pinkie pie smiles. It's been a horrible, horrible day. I just unfairly lost my job, and found out my brother was joining the navy.
Yeah. Shakycam when it's just people walking through doors or using the internet.
Dat Google.
11,01pony_245024: Google is your friend.
dat google
dat old logo

good old google
Im 22 and male, and didnt even cry when my grandmother passed 2 years ago. but i might just cry today. Please somepony give me something to giggle at.
pony_245024: You like stand-up?
XD, Im watching the old batman show. Good stuff.
uhhh panic panic panic!
11,01Kandarihu: Product placement.
Yeah, see these shots didn't need shaky cam. You don't need to add "action" to the scenes that are supposed to build the plot and explain what's happening. XP
BlazeAngel: adam west is going to be at dragoncon
I just dont know what to google. I dont know where to start. Even DJ PON-3 cant get me to smile...
BlazeAngel: The one from the '60s?
Vinco: Yeah. :)
BlazeAngel: That's the best!
In love stand up.
I know!
pony: watch moonstruck
To paraphrase CK|Catnap, product placement is fine, when it's done well and where it belongs.
* i love stand up.

WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH AIRLINE FOOD?

I can't beileve I haven't seen a stop sign
Meanwhile, thousands of miles away
The Mayans just made a measurement of time that long exceeded their country's life span. If the Mayan empire still existed to this day, they'd have their 6th age calander ready to go for a few hundred more years.

Actually, the amount of time he took to choke him I am sure he is just passed out. =\
The pen truly is mightier than the sword. You can use it to buy a tazer and knock out the swordsman.
Ikaruga, you, the bullets, and most of the enemies are either white or black. Being the same color as bullets absorbs them into missiles. Simple concept, LOTS of variety in the execution.

get ultimate
Well...that was some bad luck for me...
Kandarihu: Ultimate edition is best due to great DLC etc
Found a ravine within a ravine in Minecraft
what happened OtakuTom
Just so happens that my only way out of it involved getting blown up by like 5 creepers at once...
So I lost ALL of my tools
And a good 10 levels of exp
I hate the business model of DLC. I want a complete experience. So buying anything other than the full collection is a last resort for me.
>flash sales
>Flash is on one of the games
I see what you did there, Steam.

131am
13begin render
13estimated time, one hour
Shizuka: True time, 6 hours XD
13nope
1320 minute video, due to the countdown clock takes three times as long to render
Shizu: YOu sure your computer can handle it that fast?
13if it weren't for that countdown clock asuka would probably have it done in half an hour
Oh geeze
13it's always longer than the actual video, but varies between twice and three times as long depending on how complex it is
