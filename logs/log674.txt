Path_Forger: I don't think you get what "cyber-crime" entails
/me sees nurse redheart for teatment
this ones similar but it has different ones
Spell-of-Gaming: Put all the internets onto 10 different giant nodes on the planet
RAWRity: probably not :/
11,01That's the phillipines.
11,01Not the US.
"Cyber-crime" most often deals with 2 things: kiddie porn and identity theft
oh those
And piracy
hacking also falls under cybercrime
piracy is the iffy issue
HoodyNinja: that was what i was thinking
occasionally copyright infringement shows up, but most often the issue is people doing super nasty, illegal stuff on the internet.
I have no idea what pirates have to do with internet crimes
CYBER CHASE
WE'RE BEATIN HACKER AT HIS GAME
0,14I see someone other than me remembers that
HoodyNinja The Pirate Bay is a torrent site
I do.......
ugh torrents
It was a great show.
BTW, Anonymous Philippines hacked a webpage on the first day of the anti-Cybercrime law. :P
Lunar_Brony: :\
personally I do not think piracy is cybercrime because of past technology advancements and laws regarding such
Buytoast: was just thinking of a joke with them
Buytoast I LOVE that show! The old episodes, though. I'm not a fan of the new animation style
2,14 okay chat, gather round. I'm going to be doing a bit of an experiment this stream
Okay.

Ryunosuke yea, I would only use torrents if the material doesn't exist or out of print for a long time
LadyCanary I would hope not
LadyCanary: Sadly, no
2,14 so this is something I've been wanting to do since before I was a mod, SO DON'T FUCK IT UP

Laurayne: good for you! i had to recreate mine twice XD
Alrighty then ^_^

2,14 artist will be included for other themes
Meanwhile: I agree with that. But that's why albums will be worth more cause of it.
ValtheJean: Are you keeping score?
Ohai :3

Oh wait. Three
I seriously don't use spellcheck.
Musicals? HAHAHA I'm going to lose
Ponies47: right there with you

I thought I figured what this might be, but I guess it isn't.
03 It's fine, really
Glory to the hypno-gator
I may have found what this is.

BTW, anti-Cybercrime law only did one good thing: no spamming. :P
Hush, listen to musical number.

HYPNO GUMMY
05,15RAWRity shut it! It's awesomely amazing
OH MY GOD
00,02D:
Celestia didnt make that
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH

Hai cachi01
ಠ_ಠ okay.
ValtheJean: are you at all excited for the Les Mis movie coming out this year?
cachi01: hi?
hi Zuxxez123 and DerpyMuffins :)
You have a lovely taste in music, Val ^_^ didnt know you liked musicals this much
Zuxxez123: lol
00,02i cant participate in the game for various reasons but at least i can listen to stream
RDash5000*
Gummy knows how to party, he learned from the best
2,14 was raised to be a choir boy
RAWRity: Wanna know a secret? (I got teary eyed when I saw the trailer.) xD
2,14 it's a past I can't seem to be rid of :P
Heh XD
gummy doesnt give a fuck
cachi01: I know what you meant... Just find it funny how often I'm mistakenly highlighted xD
finish him

Lol :D
fucks given by gummy: 0
rdash: oh lol
DAMMIT
Oh, fluttercry
SO CLOSE
fluttercry you are so cheating it's unreal.
2,14 once again, bullet mark fluttercry
fluttercry: AGAIN
gummy doesnt have ears...he thinks he's listning to techno
I'm starting to think fluttercry ain't on the up n up
Meanwhile: Everyone is cheating; it's whoever can copy and paste faster.
05,15:p
gummy is just high
no Zuxxez123 its not that
Shiiiiiit
Zuxxez123: He's too on the mark. He is so scripted.
I am not cheating
Val OC's with a tunic in the middle of a church singing uhmmm
11,01fluttercry: is winning now.
Oh god :D
Zuxxez123: its whoever can press up-enter the fastest
its whoever can spam fastest
00,02Zuxxez123, no, its whoever see's the -m soonest
Gummy can sense vibrations in the ground. He can tell between techno and... this
Ah, musical guessing game?
OH SHIT
I cannot hear it
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
2,14 this one is basically a giveaway
<_>
Zuxxez123: I'm actually typing it up. :$
...Well that just gave it away.
Phantom of the Opera
XD
hmmm... is it Phantom of the Opera?
05,15I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TIS COULD BE
LOL
~you sin me right round baby right round now....like a record baby right now right round now~
DAFUQ WAS THAT?!
gummy gives no fucks
Hmm, I wonder what this song could be.......:P
I give you credit AJIsAwesome.
*spin
2,14 as I said, some are very easy :P
I got it first :p
Just spam up-enter. Be careful not to start doing too early because after a few seconds of spamming you might be disconnected
00,02i think it might be from the phantom of the opera
Wish I watch Broadway now
Nah
DAFUQ WAS THAT?!
even though it was easy as all heck
Needs more repo in this opera
oops
05,15I know this musical as well
my bad
RaveBrony: I can second that.
RaveBrony, I third this
I have no idea :S
2,14 btw, I did my best to try and find the original cast for all of these, but grooveshark is limited
05,15You'd be surprised how many musicals make their way to Concert and Marching Bands
2,14 so if any of the songs suck, blame grooveshark
fthis is fine :p
/me blames otakon
Glad to see im not the only one who enjoys REPO :D
ValtheJean: /) for trying to get all of the original cast proformences.
This is an opera? :S
Ah yes, Phantom of the Opera, the musical that gave Andrew Lloyd Webber the freedom to make shit for the rest of his career
RaveBrony: I love that movie. :3
If anything, blme sxypretendr
has anyone notice gummy is looking diagonal like \)
fucking "love never dies" can eat me.
^
RaveBrony, I have that movie downloaded. Haven't watched it yet
also, I demand a song from the Spider-man Broadway Musical
2,14 okay, poll time
Actually, never saw that.
I was thinking more along the lines of Annie Oakley.
pole time
Spamalot pls
2,14 who thinks it would be more entertaining if I unmuted vinyl randomnly?
twilight_sprinkle: ..........
:3
Ho Sana, Hey Sana, Sana Sana ho! Hahaha :D Ah the days of catholic school
That'd be horrifying.
RaveBrony: I actually have watched Repo because it is on Netflix. :D
ValtheJean: me
Do it.
/me puts on his stripper outfit
00,02ValtheJean, hmmmm
/me raises hand
NO DONT
ValtheJean: I do. :D
i cant beleve octvia is on here on bronystate
ValtheJean: well lets see how you do

2,14 true, as I said, this is mostly an experimental stream :P
00,02TheGreatAndPowerfulT, o u :P

oh me
Wait, where did I get this hand in the first place? :O
whelp. im out. peace out brony state
ASoftFluffyThing: Nice :o

NIght, RDash5000 :)
/me 00,02hugs TheGreatAndPowerfulT
/me hugs Phase4 back
Gummy is too distacting...

Zuxxez123: I watched it becuz my friend forced me to, and i loved it ever since :D
05,15man...now I miss being in band.

What? I got in first.
I'd say you are all very good at this, but most of you are just googling
Kandarihu: Not on mine
Kandarihu: no, you didn't.
Looks like me on my client.
that would be Rent
OH GOD
Kandarihu: fraid not
/me still hopes for some South Park / Repo. :3
OKay, this is EASY.
same here meanwhile
You're relying on streamer side.
<3
even when i win i lose
Really? It looks like that to me.
Where do we put in answers
This song is so factual
Pfft. No idea :D
05,15Oh god....this one
Hahaha
I miss this song
2,14 that's mIRC and the internet for you
How do you measure, measure a year~
what is
00,02flutterchu, you got ninja
00,02i meen fluttercry
2,14 it logs the messages when YOUR client receives it
2,14 not when it was actually sent
05,15I had to sing this choir
i think im just going to groove to this
00,02flutterchu, fluttercry: y you guys have such close names
So're you unmuting at random or what?
this weeks challenge is to make up a team name, the top 3 winners get a win token and will be the caption of the team
00,02i think i sung this song once
ValtheJean: wait, so does it go by pms?
2,14 mmm....not yet...I'd rather not put you all in stress. This is meant to be fun :P
Yeah but that stress is hilarious.
2,14 but, at the end of this stream, if you have suggestions for next time, please do PM me
it's not even worth trying anymore since these are continuous and there's already people with dominating head starts
OH
sang this for chorus back in seventh grade
05,15just spell it right when joining
THAT EXPLAINS EVERYTHING :p
just for the record: This musical can eat me.
unless the points are reset everytime
Polydunami: i know the channel thankyou :p
so remember folks, just spam up+enter near the end of the song, but dont start too early or you might get disconnected
I think he said points'd roll over.
Phase4: i dont remember seeing fluttercry here on june........i guess.....all of you forgot me and thought i was a newbie when i came here in august ;_;
I should just say it in mane chat and watch everyone fight for it
/me sings along
OneTrickPony!!
2,14 I'd rather you didn't hoody
/me 00,02hugs flutterchu
currently fluttercry has 8 points I believe
05,15flutterchu I've been here since last September
Yes master

/me bobs head to song

Then we'd have to mute the main chat, HoodyNinja
Meanwhile: is 2nd with 6

RAWRity: Eh?
05,15and*

fluttercry currently has 12 points
Meanwhile: it's Seasons of Love, not 525600 mins
RAWRity: I didn't write that...

^
00,02my friend loves this song

Another one that makes me want to mute instead of participate.
00,02STREAM Y U BREAKING. this is what i get for using mplayer
from transexual
Stay for the night~
This sounds oddly sexual
Antici......................................................................
TRANS-sexula.
DerpyMuffins: Ya think?
Aaaand for admitting that, I'm considering myself banned for the rest of the event.
Transylvania!

Second to fluttercry, can i get credit?
YOUR CLIENT REACTS FASTER
fluttercry: Next read with John DiMaggio as dr Frank n' Further:D
HE IS A MOD AFTER ALL
00,02it was actually imposible for me to win that one
Yeah, my client's pretty slow. :D
I got it after fluttercry ;3;
hello
lolz

Mine says I got in before fluttercry.
*somthing
00,02i'm ~250ms from the nearest server and fluttercry answered faster than that
I was 5th
Whos winning?
i'm pretty sure nobody else has a chance at this
I recodnize this
also 2nd:'(
Meanwhile: yours will ALWAYS say that, because IT gets YOURS first. Val's got FC's first
from somewhere
00,02DerpyMuffins, fluttercry
2,14 fluttercry unfortunately
seeing that my brother seems to won most of this musicals on dvd or something i should know them but naaaaah
RAWRity: I know that you dingbat I'm not uneducated.
own*
2,14 mods are allowed to play, but damn it I didn't think one would win :P
you didn't?
HAX
05,15:( sorry!
0,14riiiiiigged
fluttercry y u say sorry ?
fluttercry: It's okay. :D
did somthing happend
fluttercry: its alright, we still love you
00,02fluttercry and ValtheJean are now musical bro's
0,14this was clearly rigged so the mods would win
^^
i've jsut given up
2,14 just like the lttery
i blame SaxyPretender for riggin dis
he;s got sucha a lead nobody can catch up
2,14 lottery*
I can still win
Exactly like the lottery.
00,02SaxyPretender, shhhhh, don't tell them
at least at this rate
ValtheJean: well on the other hand i think he desrves it since he actually knows these songs instead of googling
what are you playing? fluttercry
pony_802082: shhh
huh, my name is wrong
anon> Assuming everyone else is googling and nobody else knows the songs
oh well, ill stay anon
05,15Even if I don't know the musical name, I can remember enough of the song to find the name
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8d1wrnMUS1qmu108o3_1280.png
is always good to know i have no musical culture
I remember watching a video based on this musical in social studies :P
RAWRity: he knows them best it would seem.
No, he's just hitting enter before everyone else.
/me listening to ValtheJean's awesome taste in music while practicing drawing OC. :3
RAWRity: no, he actually recognizes them immediately
You don't get +m anyway, fluttercry
that's literally all this contest comes down to: who has the fastest connection/reactiong coordination
damn googles not working
not really, its jsut who has the fastest fingers
and LadyCanary gets it
dat LadyCanary
AH I SKIPPED INTO MY OLD POST
DAT LadyCanary :)
2,14 <cachi01> My Little Pony intro - Black sabbath
LadyCanary and fluttercry are hacking
ok im back
fluttercry is DOMINATING
...
D:
lol cachi01
2,14 for some reason I want to give you a mercy point for that
lolz
2,14 but yes, grats to LadyCanary
ValtheJean: lol
Agreed. That made me laugh.
RAWRity, it's not even that. It's more of a matter of whose correct entry shows up first from ValtheJean's PoV.
^_^
05,15So close...Nice job LadyCanary
aw so if I gave a troll answer I could've got points? :(
cachi01: I love you so much for that. :D
so how many times did fluttercry win while i was gone?
3?
7?
ohhuh, nvm :P
00,02Meanwhile, what the?
my reaction is second too fast, or second fraction to slow. must calibrate myself:|
00,02Buytoast, almost all of them
i love u too AJIsAwesome :D
Most of them are simultaneous and coming on the exact same packet.
im back everyone
Phase4: Shut up I know what I'm doing!
0,14same >.>
THIS sounds familiar...
hmm, this rings a bell
does everyone here know how to up+enter spam?
Yes, yes we do
good :3
I do, at least
hello you just joinend the you have no musical culture contest
its quiet on my end
Wut.
05,15craaap....I it's on the tip of my tongue
SaxyPretender /)
By the way, I am sufficiently warned. If I ever admit to muting something I don't like... well, I've been warned.
2,14 one of my favorite songs from this musical :P
If Val is trying to get me to listen to more "cultured" music, it's not working
2,14 this happens to be my father's favorite musical
2,14 but not because of the music :P
Reikim val is doing some kind of contest "guess the song/musical"
05,15Wait...now I know it
AJIsAwesome: everytime i get on here, you're on too. i love you for that.
2,14 HoodyNinja...so glad to see you think so little of me
Hm
Is he playing anything?
right now?
no homo
2,14 cause obviously it couldn't be just wanting to do something fun for you all -_-
yep
ValtheJean: Aw, wanna hug?
I guess my stream is dead.
I'm sorry, I'm just a douche
well is workin for me so far
Well even if I'm not going to win thanks for this medley of show tunes Val
ValtheJean: so little of you? on the contrary, i think thats would be good
more of this kind of music on stream i mena
I had to go and continue a joke that was told 10 minutes ago
change from otanet already
Nah, play more dubstep.
All of these are great songs - makes me want to raid my Gramma's stash of musicals - she has a 50+ year collection on vhs stored in her garage :) Think I'll visit her this weekend
HoodyNinja: cultured? We had a song called "If You Were Gay" earlier
^
RDash5000: Thanks. :$
RAWRity: culture ftw?
RAWRity: Pop culture?
Hmm, Im reading a fanfic with a refernce to Caramel
RAWRity an awesome song*
hell, 2 songs ago was "Sweet Transvestite from Transexual Transylvania" FFC
Quite the ballad
no idea
RAWRity: classic
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7v5wDVDpnc&feature=g-u-u
here comes the flutterwin
RAWRity, and I honorbanned myself from #vinyl_scratch over that song.
05,15CANARYYYYYYYYYY
and LadyCanary again
.3.
pop culture classic
NOW THEY IS TIED
And Canary beats fluttercry again
Or are they?
AH CHESS
/me nestles in fluttercry's mane :3
2,14 grats LadyCanary, someone to finally chalenge Fluttercry :P
OF COURSE
this isn't about Culture. It's about music
so pretty much at this stage it's just a contest between canary and fluttercry
RAWRity: JOKES! Not for serious people.
Buytoast: I think I can still win this
what are the scores now? 24 and 24 vs 6 and such?
Well, I've been warned. I've been overwarned. How long should I be honorbanned from here for?
I have 1
1!
And yet I couldn't ask for more
Hm...
Fluttercry is losing?
The harmonies in this are lovely.
HARMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONY
05,15I.....barely recognize this one :(
this music scares me
Anyone want to take bets on who wins?
I'm loving this. Gives me more music to listen to. :)
Hmm...
I bet my single Allegr0 dollar fluttercry wins
Never heard this.
2,14 this one should be good, because I think our traditional winners wont get it right :P
2,14 let me just emphasize: the FULL name of the song
0,14(\ TheGreatAndPowerfulT
Hello eveyone, uhh, what is being streamed?

Oh god at Buytoast's guess
05,15RAWRity oh man I wish
So did I but I guess Val's client didn;t.
05,15I SANG THIS TOO
Im enjoying the music on stream D:
...OH MY GOD.
And I was dead last that time
THIS ONE IS EASY
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD MY MOTHER LOVES THIS
I remember I played for an orchestra group that did this. :O
2,14 most of our mothers love this :P
otanet, rid of.
^
This feel soo 80s
And my aunts. And my grandma. XD
2,14 since they were basically high school girls when it first came out
I hate this Gaaaaaaaame
i like the music
:P
Meanwhile's just annoyed because he can't possibly win at this.
I swear to Celestia if I dont get this first.
I dare not try to guess before the others tho.
Heh its fun seeing Gummy serve to a song with a beat like this
Ive got some lag, so im out of the game :D
^
Whaddya mean can't possibly?! I got the first points of the whole game!
2,14 he's just so happy :P
And how many since then/
2,14 gummy loves musicals
?
DON'T MOCK MEEEEEEE T^T
0,14...
i wonder if me downloading a few things will affect me
0,14Meanwhile doing a "T^T" face
05,15CANARYYYYY
...Have you had your tea for the day?
0,14I'd never thought it'd see the day
^
<3 For my mama <3
^_^
So many albums
2,14 oh ho! It's getting fierce up here :P
-_-
Jersey Boys?
NEXT SONG, DJ! YEAH!
2,14 one right guess, and LadyCanary catches up to fluttercry
o_o
05,15Oh it...is...ON
LOL at Buytoat's joke gusses
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/10/season-3-announced-for-november.html
OH YES
...Hm.
...I'm not old enough to get any of these.
OH WELL. Might as well enjoy the tunes anyway~
RDash5000: yep
I might be
Reikim the feeling is mutual
ValtheJean: you should let me do this one night. I'd stump folks with punk rock stuff.
but no
05,15LET'S DO THIS
OH I have NO IDEA what this could be
0,14RDash5000, no non-image links during stream
LadyCanary beating you fluttercry
SaxyPretender: roger
.3.
05,15She's tied!
You should start unmuting it randomly. It'd make this competition so much fiercer.
05,15But I'll change that!
2,14 tehnically she's 4 behind
Tied means no one wins
2,14 but if she gets this she's tied
RDash5000: Only dari bot can do EqD links during stream
Damn, and i just Had to misplace that Dari pic :D
again, fuck this musical
fuck it in the face
Hm?
Well there goes my Allegr0 dollar
Why so, RAWRity
05,15It's not THAT bad
Gummy's still wobbling?
Which musical is this?
Shhhhhh
LadyCanary: a lot of reasons, much to do with the way its fans have more or less romanticized poverty
05,15secret
how long has gummy been dancing?
^
Since the start of time.
superretroworld: on hour
superretroworld: The whole game
goodnight
So...what was that?
wait wut?
05,15OneTrickPony|Study YOU BASTARD! YOU TRICKED ME
:O
CHEATING BASTARD
2,14 AND IN AN AMAZING UPTURN
fluttercry: I TOLD YOU BRO
so... fluttercry is out completely? does that mean Canary wins?
I have a feeling that I'm missing something
2,14 RAWRITY HAS TAKEN THE POINT
I TOLD YOU ABOUT THE +M
Does that really count since the answer was given away?
He was cheating?
...well damn.
Mother of fudgesicles.
Where are we dumping answers?
3rd place now!
Hah!
Ok I'm back :P
well i suck
I call his points!
fluttercry: cant you unmod yorself?
8 points baby!
05,15IF IT WASN'T FOR +O
Because...I'm not seeing any answers in here.
Reikim: The Vinyl room
This.
Hmm...
Does he keep his points?
so what happened?
05,15I could, but then I'd get kicked for colors
okay this one I DO know.
did he screw himself over?
Buytoast: He could bypass +m
I HAVE TO GET THIS ONE
Reikim answer go in Vinyl room
XDD
This one's nice.
Okay, room's open
and Canary could still beat him
well of course he could, he's a mod, isn't he?
LadyCanary winning?
13NOW WE CAN GO STRAIGHT INTO THE MIDDLE EIGHT
so why is it all classical?
05,15I know this one, but I'm not sure if I'm out :(
/me goes into the middle 7
I wish I knew what that previous song was from, which RAWRity complained about. But it's my own fault for not being in #vinyl_scratch
;3;
13NOW WE'RE INTO E
You're out.
You get nothing.
Good day sir.
Shizuka knows :3
Kandarihu: it's from Rent
This is a classic...
Kandarihu: and Rent can suck it.
RAWRity, okay. Thanks.
/me 13may or may not have sung this in high school
05,15nice
SHIZUKA CAN SING?!
Awesome
vinyl_scratch is +m anyway.
me jelly
Sumica, I finished it :3
Sean Connery?
Reikem: we answer after the song
oh shit sean connery is sing?
2,14 it's +m until the song is over
Shizu Shizu, you sing?
ah, I see!
13LadyCanary: did
:3
05,15I won't screw this one up
Canary, you didn't know? She did choir, apparently.
13i wasn't the lead in this though, i never did solos
:OOOO
HoodyNinja!
2,14 ohho!
nuuuuuuuuu
HoodyNinja :D
wow, HoodyNinja got it
Dang so close
WHAT WAS THAT
2,14 HoodyNinja geting back into this game
Oh come on not again!
holy crap!
MINE!
05,15I've been taken out of my element! My momentum is gone!
13did he get both pieces?
Ouch, last futtercry?
more like ValtheJean unmuted before the song ended :p
05,15Buytoast's joke answers make me chuckle
Ummmm may I borrow some moment to share a short story I've found?
RAWRity: Your just jealous
No.
2,14 it was over on my end =/
2,14 damn stream delays
13back to making gmod13 work
05,15Oh yeah this one!
...I should know this one.
Not in last!
Alright, i give up
phantom of the opera
2,14 well, just keep an eye on the channel when the song gets *close* to ending
Well, here we go again.
are we only choosing classical songs?
i wonder if saying skrillex - scary monsters and nice sprites would get me kicked
I just spam up enter
How're we supposed to know when it's close to ending.
2,14 the theme for today is musicals
One cannot live on the key alone.
2,14 other days it will be different themes
Oh no wait. Okay, confused because this has the same tune as one of the psalms we used to sing in mass.
angel of music?
05,15The Bass Clarinet part to this suuuuuuuucked
It would get a frowny face.
weeping_pegasi82: If you're guessing, you're in the wrong channel.
05,15Guesses go to #Vinyl_Scratch
just making sure.
No, wait. I've seen this! How come I can't remember it...
Oh shit
Oh, and thank you Shizuka
Buenas Noches Bronystate
Phantom
You gave me that answer :p
Hi, nerf_soldier! :)
It's Phantom but I don't know the song.
Because Rei you briefly swapped your brain with a boiled potato.
BRB shower
Reikim: because it comes from a wholly unmemorable, overrated musical?
Good night, nerf_soldier
Right?
/me glomps nerf_soldier
im just not even guessing anymore... there were two of these that, had it not been for +m, i would have in the bag...
Do what everyone else has been doing
05,15RAWRity what musicals DO you like?
Google the lyrics.
>_><_<
fluttercry: many. Just not Rent or this one.
dat shower
that was short
not getting this one
CURSES.
05,15Oh. Okay then
2,14 damn you fluttercry
Goddamn tabs.
2,14 someone fucking beat him!
Fackin' internet. That's never going to work in my favour.
:/
/me 13gets a shovel
?
05,15What's wrong with me winning!?
I guess I really should just do that.
It's you!
RIGGED!
You have to lose!
it's not going to work out in anyone's favor other than canary and fluttercry anyways
2,14 I want it to be close :P
05,15Yup, this one rocks
2,14 not an overwhelming domination
How does gummy do that for so long and not get dizzy?
Oh my.
why are you guys copying the same song on vinyl scratch?
it's been an overwhelming domination for a while though
Kencolt, it's Gummy
This sounds familiar...
superretroworld: Because it's the game of course
...Oh my god. Nostalgia filters just kicked into full gear.
O_O
damn do I love this song.
Talk about a combo breaker
ok, i closed the tab by accident. what's the name of answer chat again?
05,15#Vinyl_Scratch
superretroworld: You guess the song's name as soon as the mute ends
thanks fluttercry
dammit Meanwhile
Hehehehe
I remember this song from...sometime in my childhood...
Say West Side Story-I Feel Pretty for the next one
know the song... but not the musical
?
I feel like I should know who sings the chorus
Woah! I rejoin to Chess!
Pfft.
yeah I'm ready
Whoa, not now
2,14 you can still get points for one
05,15Kinixys shhhhh
Hi Polydunami.
2,14 it's whoever guesses first, and you get partial credit for partial answers
since i don't know nothing about those song i'm just putting random names right now
Hey, Kinixys
Man I love this song.
wha?
gummy's on fire
05,15Kinixys it's a game. We guess in #Vinyl_Scratch
Oh!
This one's got a lovely beat.
you go gummy
This is one very sexy song.
oooh. shoot.
05,15HOODY NINJAAAAAAAAAAA
AHA
damn hoody
YES
He's up+entering!
2,14 Let me just remind you guys
Look at all those posts¬
noooooo
2,14 it's SONGNAME, THEN Musical Name
How are you bastards so fast?
nothing last forever
2,14 however, because I'm biased against fluttercry
everything last forever
Order matters?
2,14 I'll still give it to hoody :P
dammit will why are you so deep
Yay!
The system is broken
05,15HEY! THAT'S NOT FAIR!
!
:O
SAYS THE GUY D-D-D-DOMINATING
second fracture too fast now:(
05,15The system is corrupt!
ValtheJean: But didn't I beat Fluttercry and have it in the right order?
Oh come on, fluttercry, you bypass +m. :P
hope led zeppelins comes on
THIS SONG
OH GOD
IT'S A CONSPIRACY, I TELL YOU!
Kinda cheating there dont you think ValtheJean?
OH MY GOD
2,14 J_E watch the stream, I'll show you what it looks like on my end
seriously ?
Meanwhile: Try up entering yourself, might get a point
like seriously ?
HoodyNinja: Shaddup.
Polydunami: actually makes it harder because you cant up+enter spam
Dang it
ValtheJean, I wonder if you got any french musical stuff
This is in a musical? I learned something new today :)
05,15I can't help but snap to all of this musical
It sounds like a hippie wrote this
2,14 I doubt it, unless you count Les Mis as French (which it doesn't really count)
i wonder if val have something i know without google
I was thinking of something from Don Juan
and yeah I really doubted you had any
Trying to search this gets the Fergie song.
Dammit.
DerpyMuffins: It sounds like something from the 50's - before hippies
ValtheJean: If this test is a success and think up of some rewards, do you think you'll make this a weekly planned thing instead of doing it at random?
2,14 most definitely
Before hippies?
Hmm
eeyup
i heard this before.....*clap* *clap*
:D Gummmi is just rockin'
OH CRAP.
pary hard
dat fail spam
flutter got it I think
2,14 hoo boy, you guys better step it up if you want to beat fluttercry
damn you Buytoast :D
Alright Bronies, off to bed. My last night in Oklahoma for this go around. Tomorrow, home to California.
OH COME ON

Night, Mozdoc! :)
MY SCREEN HAS ME GETTING TWO POSTS BEFORE HIM

Mozdoc: Have a nice time back! :)
g' night Mozdoc
Fucking internet. I give up.
your screen sucks
FC is a cheating bastard.
Night Mozdoc
Yeah. I quit.
I gave up a long time ago. :D
??
Hmmm
This sounds like a Disney song
There's literally no point.
Sounds vaguely familiar
05,15Reikim I most certainly am not
I just add the music to my playlist because I love this.
why do you think i keep entering joke answers?
05,15I just have NOOOOO life
Yes you certainly are.
there's been no hope for a while now
Clearly you have some kind of weird music database plugged into your brain.
And that's in turn plugged into IRC.
This has a hint of Disney for some reason
05,15I haven't seen this one yet, but I REALLLLLY want to
oh well
I'D BETTER GET THIS
MY COUSIN LOVES THIS.
ok
im ready
Ok I'm back :P
This is hilarious :D
2,14 if fluttercry gets this again, I'm going to start unmuting randomly
hello Ponies47
05,15HoodyNinja LadyCanary I just want you to know, whatever happens, We're musical bros
^_^
DO IT
This is not the no-life matter. I have no life too, but i don't have such a ridiculous, precise reaction
fluttercry: you need to make a tactical loss here..
05,15But....winning
I claim FC is using a script.
Cheeeaaaaterrrrr
05,15psh. like I have that tech knowledge
Then you blackmailed Phase into making one for you!
Dammit, Buytoast :D
2,14 awwwwww, RAWRIty
RAWRITY!
It's a natural gift i think, but still: HAAAAAX:P
2,14 you didn't get the full song name
2,14 BUT, you got the musical right
ValtheJean: I still get the musical though, and that robs Flutter of points
2,14 2 points go to RAWRity, 1 to Fluttercry
crap I missed it
so hey, I'll go with it. 10 points
05,15I'm okay with that
9 points...
fluttercry: lets pretend you planned that :D
RAWRity: I hate your couch
...
WELp
OH
oh boy
MY GOD
seriosly ?
HoodyNinja: 10. 4+4+2
WE'VE GONE DISNEY NOW
that gave it away right off the bat
SaxyPretender, PLEASE SAY YOU'RE LISTENING TO THIS
Oh...oh. What's this?
RAWRity: No, I'm one behind you
Hey-- like most Disney moves aren't musicals?
0,14>.>
my freaking childhood is hitting me
and then LadyCanary
05,15Sounds like the opening to The Pacific for some reason
probaly the only one i know
2,14 and LadyCanary gets it
welp
0,14fuuuuuu
Oh. It's...um.
last song for me - then I'm off to bed - Goodnight ahead of time
Canary
Ur...
-_-
How
guessing was open
he opened it randomly
/me For some reason feels like doing somthing really stupid tomorrow by wearing a pony shirt to school
Ok I literally don't know what this is from.
05,15NO! Disney....my one weakness
disney is taking ove rthe world.....but in a good way
Meanwhile: SERIOUSLY?
Meanwhile: Disney's Hercules
2,14 note to self, more disney
Oh right.
Go the distance like Gaston.
and LadyCanary wins
I think I saw that once.
/me Stuffs Disney in fluttercry's face
almost
0,14AWWWWWW YEAH, DIS SONG
:3
So... We're just going to let the song play, then?
LadyCanary names i wrong isn't ?
Finally some Disney
00,02i've not seen this movie in a LONG time
name is*
Maybe I can get a point in
/me looks forwards to the Disney
rawr?
I heard an AMAZING acapella version of this song.
/me has never seen Disney's Hercules
I cried.
/me braces for the angry mobs
2,14 so yes, the unmuting will be random
2,14 to keep fluttercry on his toes
O_O
O.O
05,15Aww man, then I can't talk in chat :(
2,14 kekekekekeekekekeek
0,14this is my favorite Disney animated movie
^
I will go most anywhere
Woah beading the rules already ValtheJean?
It's going to be quiet
To find where I belong~
2,14 hey man, this aint official yet :P
You belong in a skip.
2,14 this is experimental
05,15just wait...one day there will be a classic rock day, and you will ALL pay
SaxyPretender: it's one of my faves too
my favorite still is Fox and the hound first and Lion King 2nd
^
wowsers
dammit, this throws my jokes of track
fluttercry: Dont count your chickens just yet
i will pay?
/me opens wallet, and a moth flies out.
fluttercry: We're paying now
do you take insects?
fluttercry: i'd love that
wait song changed
2,14 and Polydunami gets the win
its not really random
Where have I heard this before?
My brother was Mr Bumble :D
its just at the beggining now
05,15THIS GAME SUCKS! *flips a table*
The Lion King was my favorite (the original, not the DVD version)
2,14 so you think
FC
RAGE Much
OTAKON
So I have observed
2,14 for 2 songs buddy
I didn't have to think about it
2,14 2 does not make majority
Rage quit already fluttercry?
fluttercry: AVGN Much?
05,15I'm playing around guys. sheesh

but it's all the evidence that has been displayed so far
05,15I'm just having fun with musicals

*points if you got the reference
the bad thing about disney movies is that i know them perfectly.... in spanish.
2,14 hoody: how about you just play instead of bitching?
/me shuts off smart-ass mode
You can turn it off?
Sometimes
2,14 huh...that was an odd cut
This is sung by Nancy

And i'm back, sorry about earlier, got a blackout.
Kencolt: So what is it from?

I will react trust me
Meanwhile: The Lion King. First song. Circle of Life. Just not in English-- sounded German to me.
Kencolt: Oh, I still haven't seen The Lion King.
I try to blame it all on 4chan?
00,02Meanwhile, D:
00,10it's offical my mind has been altered. I see spam email for "vinyl sideing" guess where my mind went.

Buytoast I don't know the song and I can tell your guess wasn't even trying
2,14 and RAWRity with the technical steal

Oh, THIS... and of course Meanwhile has no clue.
00,02TheGreatAndPowerfulT, its geentoo users that need to build all the things
ValtheJean: Timing it before the chorus so I can't google?
so what's the scores atm?
hell, i recognized this from the first line
I've never seen this movie
i just got a papercut from my mouse, hows that possible?
kk you do love linux right Phase4 ?
Kencolt: The Producers.
SaxyPretender it /almost/ got WMC'd

Everyone who regularly goes to BMN know that
The Matrix is my favourite movie.
Eraserhead
Whelp, I'm a failure here.

HoodyNinja: :p

its funny that fluttercry is still way in front
00,02HoodyNinja, calm down a little eh
i guessed the producers. what do i get?
2,14 you owe me a lot of points Buytoast :P
a cookie?
Phase4: One point ;_;
Hey ValtheJean if this becomes a regular thing, will there be a set time how long this goes? We've been going at this for about two hours now. I mean it's a lot of fun but will there be a set time it ends?
Buytoast: technically you have less than nothing
Buytoast should be winning
00,02and then fluttercry won
00,10wait you owe IQ points?
2,14 there will be a set time, yes. As I've said many times before, this is just an experiment
00,02HoodyNinja, you'll need to get one more then
I want at least 3rd
00,02mario_pony|, connection troubles?
what the heck is going on in the chatroom :D
So who is winning?
HoodyNinja: then you can stay one point behind me and beat Lady, since she's gone now
2,14 okay, 3 minutes left in the song, who votes skip?
skip
Phase4: Nope ^-^
RAWRity: Her score is still up
Oh wow
HoodyNinja: so you and I both get one more right
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvgKtOH8l2M&list=FL5gY8b-7VNyfXap3pAC3yzA&index=10&feature=plpp_video can you put this :)?
p4ngya: a music guessing game
Might as well skip; you can give us an encore later on
Wait what?? mario_pony|? O.o
I need to get at least 3rd
Forgottencrow: no vidd links during stream
That is, if you don't mind
Forgottencrow: You should've PM'm that. :)
Forgottencrow: PM song suggestions
I never shoot for best, but at least the top 3
ok sorry
Phase4 I'm Canadian. You didn't use the proper phrasing to put "eh" on the end of your sentence. You didn't even bother to put a question mark on for buck's sake! I will type out an essay in PM telling you how to properly use "eh?" if necessary.
00,10awwwwww i was enjoying that
is there a stream up or no
That's pretty cheap
Incase you can't tell, I get pretty pissed off when "eh?" is misproperly used
RaveBrony: Yes?
:o
p4ngya: tHERE'S A GAME.
/me 00,02hugs Lunar_Brony
00,10C"eh"N"eh"D"eh"
Lunar_Brony: ik eh
mario_pony|: I havent seen you in like forever :D
2,14 huh, looks like this is the hardest one of the night
love this song
2,14 still no guesses
Don't look now
RaveBrony: Oh well I don't talk much
:P
Sumica that is how you spell "Canada".
ValtheJean: I guessed
2,14 and RAWRity takes the point
superretroworld :D
but he said flash gordon
woo!
not rawrity, the singer
00,10Buytoast he's singing of movies at the drive in
RAWRity: Let me get one more point, please :(
HoodyNinja: we'll see
I love drive-in movies
RAWRity: I can kill you
^^
this is rigged more than a seaman's mast
there's only 3 in my province, and one is in my city!
2,14 yes, it is rigged against people who make joke guesses
HoodyNinja: where would the honor be if I LET you win? Wouldn't it be better if you beat me while I'm trying by hardest?
well cya everypony got homework to do:)
Sure, they only show movies that are a month old, but it sure as hell is fun to go to.
i blame Parliament
seeya scout19_tf2
scout19_tf2: see ya
Only three driveins in BC, Lunar_Brony? Dang :S
NIght, scout19_tf2 :)
Bye scout19_tf2
HoodyNinja: also, watch out for Polydunami. He's one full guess from passing you
<_< >_>
Polydunami IKR? Unfortunate truth.
Ohai SuperBrony64
/me has never been to a drive in
RAWRity: You are older and therefore know more about the more classic pieces that Val is playing, and while it could be considered cheating since I am using google, I didn't have the advantage of witnessing these things first hand
ValtheJean, what about people who complain about songs?
2,14 think of it this way
HoodyNinja: get better
beat me
RAWRity you will never truly watch a movie until you watch it at a drive-in
2,14 he may know musicals better
2,14 but there are plenty of other themes
oh, musicals
forgot about that
2,14 so who knows? maybe you'll do better in Biebernomics :P
2,14 just kidding, I wouldn't force you all to listen to Bieber...much
00,10no one got this yet?
ValtheJean: will we be doing this again with a differnet theme?
2,14 haven't opened it :P
I stop participatin. :D
00,10ah
great, I'll nev-KEEP THOSE SONGS THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME!!!!

11,02I got one question right and made it in the top 10 \:3/
/me is sad
HoodyNinja: btw, you said I was older than you. How old are you?
ASoftFluffyThing, I admitted to muting a song with... let's just say it had "protected" lyrics.
SuperBrony64: Theres not even 10 people
Who's up for some Whose Line?
SuperBrony64: there weren't even 10 players
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf99E7WssCE
SuperBrony64 <3
RAWRity: I'm 15

Kandarihu Ohhhh
HoodyNinja: I'm 19. 4 years isn't gonna make a big heap of difference.
SuperBrony64: Not to mention you came in right at the end of the thing
I pretty much honorbanned myself from the channel.
technically, i'm in the top ten too, aren't I?
no
because everyone else had 0
RAWRity: I was a sheltered child
Lunar_Brony: THAT ONE
Buytoast: well most ppl have 0, so no :(
bullshit
Oh god, that was hilarious
Polydunami eeyup :)
so what was the last song?
Buytoast, you at least have more points than me, or at least you should.
i dont know what we're playing.
To/Die/For
I should feel bad for Ryan, but I don't
also, I managed to get 2nd despite being 16 points behind LC. I feel proud.
It's over now.

In all fairness, Buytoast should've won
Dat SuperBrony64

Buytoast: I'll say it again, your joke answers were great. Make it a running gag if we do this thing agin
Also, sorry for not pinging you Zuxxez123 :$
Funfact: I googled the lyrics, thought that band's name was Dying embers, and ended up an indie rock bandcamp page
Zuxxez123: ponies will help you
It's okay AJIsAwesome! :3

Zuxxez123: you're not alone
i probably will since i seem to be in the negative hundred millions now

i would call it more of an identity crisis
I still inspire to be like AJIsAwesome, but I need to keep something busy until I can reach those goals. :3
Too bad "Philosipher" isn't technically a job
AJIsAwesome has a job?
you know, if I were the one doing the Guess That Tune, I'd be fucking with people's google-fu by choosing foreign language songs
I'm busy :P
Zuxxez123: Why would you say that? Please stop, please...:$
I'll be back in a few minutes
ik what i wanna do but it involves a university degree, its gonna be a rough 4 - 10 years
HoodyNinja: I don't.
HoodyNinja: it could be if you wrote about your philosophical views i guess
0,14if I did Guess that Tune, it'd be all video game music
SaxyPretender: That's seems like a good idea.
p4ngya: Yes, but who would waste their time reading my crap?
AJIsAwesome: Alright; I'll stop with that. :3
Zuxxez123: Thank you.....:$
how much Nintendo music would be in it SaxyPretender?
What's worse, it would have to be named in the original language.
If I did guess that tune, I would sing the songs so you wouldn't get it right away
0,14probably not much
Let's see somebody guess きゃりーぱみゅぱみゅ - ファッションモンスタ
then I would fail miserably
0,14it'd be mainly fighting game music
I know! I'll make a living making crappy fan fics! Yes! The most fail safe plan ever! I'll be rich!
SaxyPretender: inb4 SuperBrony64 kicks for saying that :D
FUCK THAT
*kicks you
then I would fail more than miserably

Okay, so, I left ages ago. And I should be in bed right now. But I have returned in order to deliver a VERY SPECIAL MESSAGE.

You shall all henceforth refer to the chatter known as "Meanwhile" as "Meaniewhile".
Thank you.
No you shall not.

Reikim: Saxy is saxiest pretender?
SaxyPretender the first is old news, the second is insignificant
and he's gone
/me goes to edit the Moderator scripts to replace Meanwhile with Meaniewhile
Lest you risk the unending wrath of the elder plague and suffer eternal torment in the hands of the wretched filth.

0,14yep, my local comic shop has the Derpy cover
Can't; I've got hands.

The best minigame is the racetrack
The day and night thing was also used in MP6.
wth?
best minigame is bowser minigames from MP4
Luigi didn't even flinch
is worse when you could buy those thing but they don't get sold where you live and shipping cost way more than the thing you want

thank you ChainChomp that cleared everything up :)
This is just annoying
I think some of this hate should be reallocated to Yoshi
PLS NO
.............I hate this one.
Spell-of-Gaming, next to Monopoly
Aww, what did Yoshi do? :(
Sorry everypony, but since my dad is an ass, I have to go to sleep...
VenHur, tell him Mario is on.
AW SHIT
NOT THE BEES
Sooo, gimme mah taco suit.
Why does the beehives look like the beehive sprites in Animal Crossing?
awwww bye VenHur
Easy enough, if you can avoid the behives
bye, VenHur :
Oh nuts
*:)
Bye VenHur
bye VenHur
Also, this minigame is pretty easy until you have to deal with THE BEES, OH GOD, NOT THE BEES
DAMMIT LUIGI

Yes.
SpadeMagnes[R]: 4
SpadeMagnes[R]: 8
Battul tiem
/me Loves mario party 6

GRAB BAG? :3
Fuck yeah MP4
4 or 8
Luigi wins by absolutly nothing
5? I thought it was okay.
*doing
my favorite is 7
how about 7
This game is annoying
Hungry Hungry Hippos
9 utterly breaks the formula of the previous 8
I love 7
Mario: It's actually a pretty good game.
SpadeMagnes[R]: In a good way.
Get the Mushrooms
Would Any[ony Like To See Some More Of My Picture Works...? I Mostly Do Editing....
yea, 9 seems a lot different than the other 8 games XD
Blah
damn you luigi
Laurayne: Sure. :)
Luigi is so OP >:3
^
It looks really boring to be honest
Requires nerf
op?
i call hax on luigi
flutterchu: OverPowered
flutterchu: Over Powered
SpadeMagnes[R]: I can honestly see that.
oooh
SHY GUYS
SpadeMagnes[R]: It's the minigames that sell it.
I seriously hate the Shy Guys on Paper Mario
I love the minigames in 9
/me is a green shy guy :3

FUCK YOU LUIGI
Well, that's it for this game
Why is Luigi so pro?
WizardKong: >:]
Laurayne: That's pretty good. :)
This is like that video where Luigi wins by doing nothing
/me throws magical poo at Petrified_Luigi
http://s1260.photobucket.com/albums/ii571/flutterchu2/?action=view&current=a8597c2e.png
WizardKong: D: Ewwwww
i like luigi's old voice (mario party 2 voice)
Three dice.
Who put these pictures in my bucket?
<.<
>.>
i just thinked he evolved to much liek pikachu ;_;
The only MP games I dont own are 2,4,and 9
woah wat..
:D
ha
YES
:O
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT
:(
What happened?
So you just lose 20 coins?
Why all the super mario related names?
True_Luigi: SUCK IT
SpadeMagnes[R]: He got a negative star.
How is Ztar even pronounced?
WizardKong: ............:I
Mario Party DS is the one that pulls my hair the most.
SpadeMagnes[R]: Zzz-tar
All the Ai are locked on a specfic item
True_Luigi really likes his keys
...I seem to like coming here late night
Mario: Yes :3
Luigi goes for keys, Peach goes for plunder chest
Luigi and his skeleton keys...what's he planning? :)
Poly_Yoshi: Yep. :3
oh who's treaming now?
Every CPU character goes for a specific item every time regardless
At least he's not DK, who goes for Bowser :P
It's SuperBrony64, Dken2021
Petrified_Luigi: *whispers Big Boo?*
Dken2021: Superbrony64
He's currently Mario
oh, ok
This one's fun.
Waluigi is one of those out of fucking nowhere characters
"TOAD" in a box
Mario Party = Nintendo Land, somehow, judging from the trailer.
I just saw him in 3 and asked...where the fuck did he come from?
You've got this yoshi! =D
Is luigi set on hard?
inb4 yoshi
IT'S SO INTENSE
Friggin luigi! >:3
SpadeMagnes[R]: Everyone is set on hard
SpadeMagnes[R]: Yes.
WHOS THE SECOND BANANA NOW
Dken2021: :D
Dken2021: And in the end, everyone's a loser in Mario Party XD
TO THE LEFT
my money is on luigi
cant get it
why is the key in the milk? has superbrony cow been eating keys?
No one truely wins at mario party
DeathStar: Maybe.... <.<
>.>
Friendships are broken, controllers are thrown
Mario Party is like the Monopoly of video games.
And coins are lost
SpadeMagnes[R]: Only me
SpadeMagnes[R]: Not mine. :D
play mario party with firends :)
YEAH
the computer alwase cheats. ever played comand and conquer?
Bowsasuit
Luigi is the people's hero
Magic doooor

Just watch; someone is going to land on the bank
Hi, Queen_Chrysalis :)
Queen_Chrysalis: Sup.

Poly_Yoshi: I am. :)
What was the plot for 4 anyway?
heloo Queen_Chrysalis

SpadeMagnes[R]: it's your birthday. :D
Hi Queen_Chrysalis
Luigi abandons coin in favor of bomb. Seems legit.

Well, then
Petrified_Luigi: Green bastard
PFFF
RAGE QUIT
KICK ASS
Oh god.
THIS GAME CHEATS
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

This is like Proton John winning in Mystery Land
/me hugs Mario "It's okay" :(
Welcome to the Free-Star-Club, WizardKong :)

No, Luigi goes for Skeleton Keys. Always.
/me hugs True_Luigi back :3
Its AI programming
/me knocks WizardKong off the podium
Aww
Oh hey
Doh I missed
Best team up
Oh dang it, not me
NEVER BE THE PILOT FOR THS GAME
I'm bad at steering :(
Always shoot the torpedos
I HATE THIS GAME SO MUCH
What MP has the worst story?
If MP has any story to begin with
SpadeMagnes[R]: 8
SpadeMagnes[R]: Probably 4.
geno isnt only in super mario RPG
Oh baby
http://www.mariowiki.com/images/2/29/Genomlss.PNG
Are they reusing the target texture from Super Smash Brothers? :P
SpadeMagnes[R]: It centered around the player rather than the MP universe.
at least I hate its equivilent in mp3
Spell-of-Gaming: Maybe......<.<
>.>
Damn you DK :|
:D
Stolen!
No one has the hope of beating MyNameIsKaz in a button mash
flutterchu unfortunately square still owns the rights to geno
SHIT
Poly_Yoshi: Fuck you, Yoshit
Dante: whatever
:P
:|
Yoshi is mlg :3
Suddenly control stick spinning mini game!
TREASURE TO YOUR RIGHT
>Take 20 coins from Luigi
>Give 5 coins to Mario
Bowser forgot how to be a jerk
Too bad, SpadeMagnes[R]; not in this game

Have you forgotten that Mario's your sworn nemesis, Bowser? :S

Punch luigi and steal his lunch money
Unfortunately, I don't have a Gamecube Controller. :(

Bowser is either atheist or communism.

Whoever's playing is one lucky bastard. Why? Because playing it with at least 1 other player can RUIN friendships
13shouldn't you wait on the left pillar, jump for the coin, then land on the right pillar as it raises
yeah. so much for co op
Eddmario: it depends on how good you take loseing....
it's pretty much the next battletoads in terms of multiplayer

00,02all the files
00,02looks like my hard drive
13and that's how Mac OS stores its files
snakes LOL
best filing
Ribs n't beans
what was I thinking
11,02Defragment? No, too much pressure, you do it *crawls under desk*
13but
13defragging
13is so pretty
Hey here's a problem! Propane's filled under P! "Well that's because Propane starts with a P!" It should be filed under G for Gas!
DEFRAGGING?
:D
00,02i use ext4, it doesn't fragment in the first place :P
Phase4 teach me your ways
dat poking
13silly mint installer... not sure which ext my laptop is running :3
I'll see you guys tomorrow in the morning.
00,02srsly, i've driven this thing to 100% full several times with the most bizare combonations of small/large files
00,02its ~5 years old and only 2% fragmented
with no fragmentation?
WHAT
Phase4 YOU HACKER
Shizuka: just insall on the big one
00,02Panda|Packing, free space bitmaps
00,02i've NEVER defragmented
...
you
hacker
00,02linux, not windows, ntfs fragments like crazy
Yeah, but he gets another kind of help....
i 14% fragmented in like 2 weeks
13NOT THIS GUY AGAIN
this guy
00,02Panda|Packing, cause you use ntfs
lol wat
Phase4 FAT32*
00,02thats even worse
I know XD
00,02also get your files off fat32
13hmmmmmm
13681GB out of 1.34TB used... haven't defragged asuka at all since i got her in oct 2010.... dare i open defrag..
00,02no journaling, so no guarantees of integrity
phase4 are you going to play some kerbal space program today?
00,02NENUDJUS, maybe
00,02Shizuka, do it!
Thats what I'm doing now actually Phase4. Gonna format my external hardrives to NTFS
:3
00,02Panda|Packing, dont format, you can convert in place
F the law
Phase4, well I wanna clean it all out because it has stupid stuff on it >.>
Phase4: can you Knick Crystaline_Shard?
11,02inb4 a 1 kB text document is in 67 different places
13ohgodlol
Ah thanks.
00,02Panda|Packing, http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb456984.aspx
13never mind, asuka runs defragging without me :3
:D
00,02Shizuka, oh yeah, windows does background defrag now
???
13all six partitions are 0% fragged
13i'm so proud :3
Phase4 I already knew that btw XD
13unless i specifically have to run this analysis
13inb4 100% frag
00,02its why windows slams hard drives when your not using the machine, its defraging
00,02leave your pc for a few minutes and the hdd light starts flashing
13yup
13i hibernate so much i wouldn't be surprised if that fires a short defrag before powering down
Shizuka: your computers are cool :)
13sure seems to max out drive and cpu when going into hibernate
13< oh my sounds serious
why not 120%
00,02yeah, why does windows max the hdd before it starts saving ram
Psy is on TV... AGAIN
Shizuka: it does that because it saves whats in ram to the swap so you dont lose info
00,02Panda|Packing, this is bad thing?
xD a little
13yeah i know that :3
they are rubbing the Gangnam style into the dirt >.>
00,02RoboGerbil, it runs the hdd before that though for no aparent reason
ok... so does anyone wanna just sock that sniveling worm guy
13pretty much hibernate every night now, and yeah it chugs pretty good, like way more than any game ever does
11,02Hahahahaha
13TO BE CONTINUED
haa
wut
DUN DUN DUUUUUUUN
11,02Hahaha
oh no
lol
ok well i think i shall be off to bed, good night everyone and thanks for the stream NewSuperBronyU ^_^
11,02Night NocturnalBlade :)
YAAAAAAAY

00,02what the
13http://i.imgur.com/eZ7RU.jpg
00,02who made this
gravity falls son
Shizuka, wat.
wat
13um no gravity causes things to fall
00,02oh yeah, NewSuperBronyU: you seen gravity falls yet?
/me has never seen gravity falls
11,02Just looked it up, you mean that Disney show?
00,02yeah
is a good show
00,02WATCH NOW
uh
is it funny?
00,02Panda|Packing, very
11,02Nah, I don't watch shows for little girls.
^
13wut
XD
00,02NewSuperBronyU, o u, but its ok cause its for little boys and girls
13watt
dat 8 bit gandam style
but it has soos
and books
and a hat
Watching shows for little boys is to mainstream
13oh
13guess i do have to specifically run the analysis
HE TALKS
13which says asuka's main drive is 3% fragged :3
NO WAY
i miss the wii commercials with the two japanese dudes
JOIN
Party
its a trap!
dont trust them
:D xbx live
I remember the sounds of xbox...
13wasn't that a movie
PEOPLE TALKING :O
Sketch_Toku_Brony, :|:D:|
O_o
what
so many pony images
Hey Superbrony tell JDM Works90 i said whats up
00,02Shizuka, how fragmented are your other partitions?
130
00,02ah
CoD yuk
13two are system partitions from gateway, normally hidden
for some reason I think Sb... likes the wiiU
13the other three are rei the external drive, all 0%
i'm fairly sure to make you mic line in become part of your sound out
lol is this the black ops 2 interview? it is :D
13though i guess that makes sense cause i rarely delete stuff from the externals
00,02two things i need to do, one: get windows embeded from dreamspark and see how much stuff i can remove, two: get block re-ordering working on linux to improve boot speed
Phase4, optimise?
00,02optimize'
forgive my spelling
im tired >.<
00,02Panda|Packing, and yes, its like defragmenting but moving into usefull places instead of just sequential
optimize prime operated by peter cullen
/me hugs Panda

But I've already got friends in real life :S

He wouldn't like that.
lol they finally get mentioned then you leave
Polydunami has an Xbox 360... that he never uses :P
Ninjazz, I sure as hell hope he wouldnt enjoy it.
/me thinks that xbox is over rated
Also, dat feel when I can't watch SB stream because of connection. :c
Ninjazz: not missing much
Awwww night NewSuperBronyU!
WELLP.
Panda|Packing, I'm VERY sure he would feel a bit hostile afterwards.

MadSurge, california to texas... I hope there are bronies there >.>
MadSurge: liquid to solid~
Ninjazz: I forgot where you lived, was always wondering why your connection seems to be bad alot, now I remember
DeathStar XD omg
i know a brony in texas
MadSurge: get it? states! :D
his name is ghost
/me kisses DeathStar
:P
/me kisses Panda|Packing back
DeathStar: well played maam *claps*
Panda, SlurryMoon lives in Texas
Polydunami where in texas?
is it just me or is this not loading?
Not completely sure
ooh look the buffer show~
If your happy and you know it clap your hoofs.
/me claps twice
/me glomps DeathStar
/me huggles NewSuperBronyU :3
NewSuperBronyU: how many days is it now?
so anyone remember this one :S http://i.imgur.com/ZONzp.jpg
someone needs to make a cheek and chong ponys! ASAP!
San Diego to El Paso iirc.
Yay Texas.
Grrrr. More goddamn lag.
I wonder if this is how otakon feels.
Spectrum_Rush, well, it's usually at 200 ping level. Yellow bar. This is more of a bad position to be.
/me doesn't ever clap.
/me NEVER claps.
Spectrum_Rush, you can see my "^" in that one.
Also LAG KICKED.
Ninjazz: dat lag, and yeah i'm in it too :>
Spectrum_Rush, I had a clone! :O
Spectrum_Rush: what was that show? :D
Redline
NENUDJUS uh... cheech and chong ponies? hm...
REDLINE?
WHERE
Ninjazz: if you never clap dose that mean your not happy or your happy but you don't know it?
it would be awesome
DeathStar, ...Hmmm. Probably not happy.
I'd know when I'm happy.
I smile when I do. :>
/me doesnt clap
Ninjazz, clap your hoofs
Ninjazz: but i don't want you to be not happy :(
why you ask?
Ninjazz is still less grumpy than Meanwhile :D
because pandas cant clap
Panda|Packing: pandas can so clap!
MadSurge, NO ONE bests Meanwhile in grump levels.
/me Claps his hoofs...
DeathStar, no if a panda claps it creates a time warp that will rip it in half, hence why they are endangered
Because Meanwhile is British. British people are born with snark. And snark is half grump and halp sarcasm.
Ninjazz, uh... I think i could give him a run for his money >.>
Tiberium126, sorry mate. I don't do things unless I mean them.
Panda|Packing: so that "if your happy and you know it" song killed all the pandas?
DeathStar, I'm sorry. :(
/me huggles Ninjazz
DeathStar yes.
Panda|Packing, VERY doubtful.
Panda|Packing: :'(
11,02I posted this comment to a video on YouTube: "Yeah, sure.﻿ I'm also not a Brony, I'm just a crazy internet geek who likes colorful ponies on the internet."
/me hugs DeadpoolDash back.
SB XD
HAHAHA.
/me dat feel when you're looming thru old bookmarks... and you find one for Ponibooru :<
/me hugs DeathStar back.*
11,02I got this as a response:
11,02"you're also not a faggot or waste of human resources, you're just homosexual and a useless expense"
oh DeadpoolDash why must you steal my pings~ XD
Ninjazz: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/sample/607284550442d0c29fc6278615dfe8b0.jpg have this for not being too grumpy :)
Spectrum_Rush, dat feel. T_T
NewSuperBronyU, lol thats a great comeback
I love how ponies = Faggot.... every gay person I know personally says ponies are stupid XD
MadSurge: that'll just make him sad, since it'll probably cost to much or not be for sale
NewSuperBronyU, sure smells 4chan.
11,02It makes me feel sad...I don't think I did anything to warrant such a response...
Panda|Packing: my favorite gay guy likes ponys. I can't covince him to watch friendship is magic though :(
le epic troll must be 4chan XDDD ;P
Calling a brony a faggot is offensive to bikies
NewSuperBronyU: you didn't :( he's just a stupid head
DeathStar hehe yeah.
FUN FACT: A faggot is a bundle of sticks.
and a bikie :D
Ninjazz and Spectrum_Rush: well, this is not on sale :D http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/sample/b0f98c1ddaacad23497fc598f4b48a53.jpg

Mica is still best ping.
Spectrum_Rush: so the pinkie alarm is a bad idea?

Ninjazz: I don't like shipping, but I like the idea of them being friends :)
Shipping or Friendshipping.
NENUDJUS, think of it as the verb of relationship.
Then I guess I am a friendshipper :D
NENUDJUS, I'm suprised you don't know.

/me wants to insult someone by telling them their face is shippy
mutter how would you go about that?
/me is still trying to find the perfect opportunity to use http://i.imgur.com/0hCov.png.
I dunno
thats a small boat
there is a bit of a problem because it could eaaasily come out as 'your face is shitty'
mhmm
And that's generally taken as an insult.
eeyup!
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mb50khJki91rhyxudo1_500.png
Which leads to physical violence. And last time I heard, violence hurts.

but ill stab you if your a hater
hallo everypony o.o
Bitch please
I'm with the winning P.A.R.T.Y.
Hey LightTrooper105.
Ohai LightTrooper105
/me waves the United Equestrian banner.
Hello LightTrooper105
/me give Ninjazz and DoctoDoctorWho and AdamTheDuck cheese
/me noms on cheese
/me melts the cheese down to fondu and gives it to charity.
/me is regrettably too much of a greedy bastard to give to charity
lol
Tiberium126, that's a bit hypocrtical
CrimsonPhoenix: I was jokinh
Tiberium126: was there a pm conversation I missed here?
and hi CrimsonPhoenix
http://youtu.be/niGBPR_t5R8 FRENCH
Hoy
CrimsonPhoenix: I repect someone for not having an interest in MLP
Hello CrimsonPhoenix
oh, I see
CrimsonPhoenix: U arent a brony?
I think I'llw watch a bit of Discovery or History for a bit.
DoctoDoctorWho, I don't know how to respond to that
im back everypony!
CrimsonPhoenix is a brownie.
I may be one or I may be not but would that change the fact that I watch My Little Pony?
mmm
/me hugs DoctoDoctorWho, AdamTheDuck, CrimsonPhoenix, NENUDJUS, LightTrooper105 and Ninjazz
Ninjazz: can you fill mr in on this?
Do I need to label myself to continue watching the show?
/me is hugged out of no where?
NENUDJUS, what are you saying?
my i ask why you are here if you are not one?
CrimsonPhoenix: If you are a male outside the target age group and like/watch the show, you are by definition a brony.
Ninjazz: i dont know what going on i just came back
Possibly
/me hugs Tiberium126 back
DoctoDoctorWho: I think he is messing with you
or maybe I really do not care abot the actual word itself and continue to watch the show
NENUDJUS, Oh. I see.
Finally found it, the winning P.A.R.T.Y. http://fav.me/d417vyv
Are you impplying girls can't be bronies?
CrimsonPhoenix: well your not a hater so I guess the point is moot
*implying
I'm just going to watch some educational television. CrimsonPhoenix is saying that he doesn't need to be labeled anything to be considered a fan of MLP. Personally, I consider myself a brony because that's my choice.
What Ninjazz said
mhmm
..
if you feel the need to label yourself then be my guest
Hanako: not really, the term "brony" is a non gender specific term
Good.
DoctoDoctorWho, I could argue with the whole prefix bro.
(BRO _ PONY) non gender?
That whole "pegasister" thing is just silly
omfg yay!
stream!!!
mine ears!
who is this?
i love you!
dat sudden stream
it you phase4 i can tell look at all them tabs
I can see myself
NENUDJUS, needs more tabs
okay so
/b/ro
damn you Phase4 alwase scareign me
:p
MOAR TABS!!!
/b/rother
taoumi, Success!
Hanako, YOU TASTE LIKE BACON
Whoa that was scary XD
/b/rony
CrimsonPhoenix: That's not very nice.
But is it true?
Doubtful.
NENUDJUS: Bro is gender neutral, girls can be bros too
Hanako, sorry I just had to reference a favorite video of mine
./b/ronies didn't start the fandom, /co/ did. /b/ just made it popular.
i have the demo for KSP is it a big diff between them the full game and the demo?
Ninjazz: of course, mlp has been around since the 1980's
like i cant even go to the moon on the demo
I'm referring to G4.
never mind the galaxy
MLP's existence before G4 wasn't as controversial as it is now.
DoctoDoctorWho, Those aren't the ponies we know or love.
>implying G3.5 isn't the best MLP
Especially not G3's Rarity.
Of course bronies started the fandom for g4 then, there wasnt a fandom before that!
DoctoDoctorWho, I'm sorry but what?
>Implying G3.6 isn't best nightmare fuel.
There was a fandom for older generation thank you
G3.6 doesn't exist
you forgot there are fan forums that actually collect the toys and all
And anything g3 related can burn in a hole, no wait, that would waste a perfectly good hole.
Ohkay. Whatever you say. :>
Where's Caramel when you need him?

meh
aww, so excited, I was working on a Remix of the Home theme from Shin Onigashima with Japanese Instruments. I love Ethnic Stuff :3
how well did it come out, Lil_B?
'Cause I feel like posting a somewhat-depressing song :P http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_qp6Z7BmA
^ for some reason I find it beatiful
MadSurge: I love both so im happy
Sylandest it sounds very good in my opinion, just have to make as decent ending now (almost done) and than render it and upload it , should be ready in 2 hours :)
Lil_B: woo! I'll be in class at that time, but if I get the chance to hear it, I'll be sure to ask, hehe
So Lil_B, with the name thing, what kind of names are you looking for? :3
Sylandest I always love to show my stuff to people, I just often don't ask about it because i don't wanna rub it in anyones faces (and I often think I do :( )
/me hugs Lil_B
you silly! You're not rubbing it in
RainbowPie, Ping
AdamTheDuck I still have no Idea how to call me, everything I'Äve come up with so far I didn't liked anymore after a day :(
Lil_B, rubbing it in? No I'm sure many of us would love to see your works.
^
I just want something to ponder with as I stare at my ceiling before I sleep :P
Something to keep me thinking for the next few days~
AdamTheDuck I would like something short, something that doesn't sound so random (like TheWoodenToaster etc, nothing against the artist) and if possible something german :P
the last 2 things that came To my mind was Nulkl Ouvert and Tohuwabohu (or Tabularasa) but these look really strange written down XD
Short? Damn, I like extended name s:3
names :3*
Null Ouvert*
or something that Begins with Ben, because of my actual name :)
LilBen?
ekips maybe :/ I was thinking about just derivating from Lil B and not schanging it completly, but yeah, I'm still debating with myself about everything :)
Hello everypony!
Hello Dark92Enigma
hello there Dark92Enigma
howdy Dark92Enigma :)
no stream, right?
not at the moment, no
Nope Dark92Enigma
Hi Dark92Enigma
i never got why Shizuka puts Shizuschlafen everytime she's absent.....
Hi ASoftFluffyThing!
schlafen is german for sleeping Dark92Enigma
oh, should've known better 6_9
sadly, i know little to no german
i said it......
Shizuka isn't german, but she is very close to VioletVanilla, who is german, and I guess thats why Shizuka sometimes is that way :)
It's not that heard to guess though.
hard*

damnit XD the guy with the biggest Lossless Gamerip at FFSHrine has upadted everything :P no I've to download 10GB again XD
Lil_B: guy with the what?
Dark_Horst Lossless Music ripped directly from the Game
never hear dof lossless
Alright I'm off to bed, goodnight everyone :)
Bye, AdamTheDuck
Dark_Horst normal mp3 or other codecs like ACC usually cut away parts of the Audio to compress it. lossless or codecs that really only cut out the frequenzes that you can't possibly hear to compremise the music, therefore the songs need more memory
bye AdamTheDuck :)
I'll try and think of something Lil_B~ :P
okay. what game then?
AdamTheDuck thanbks XD I eprechiate it :)

Serenity: Scooby's been around since the 60s
here comes old man to safe the day!

"I think ghosts are fun." Oh lawdy.
00,10seems legit
Why does Spidey work at the press when the boss is a dick to him
Because no one else can get pictures of Spidey.
"Ahhhh, Ballooooooooooooons!"
And Peter's kinda of an idiot. >_>

I wonder if the creators if this ever thought that this would be a streamed on a MLP dedicated stream site
Eli_Berlin must be REALLY Damn old XD
Never readt it, heard about it.
the creators probably never had a concept of the internet
00,10ekips, I would say no. seeing as there was no MLP when this was made
It's a spoof of the Marvel comics, but WITH FURRIES!
ekips or internet or streaming XD
woo hoo! furrys
ekips, did they think MLP would be streamed?
Looks like spiderman is in deep water already.
you are probably right :/
00,10awsome it's rino

Dken2021: Maybe because we just noticed his crazed faces?
ZOOOM!
Lil_B: that would be awesome :)
Ninjazz: which is canon, mind you
MadSurge, it's still silly.
Spidey gives you a statue made of pure gold. Hate him anyway.

J_E_Smith71: what program do you use to make captions?
MadSurge: I don't make captions, I just screen cap
Spidey is best super-hero AND villain.
I leave the captions to the people who can come up with funnier stuff than I could
Lil_B: stores are closed today anyways. most of them at least... happy B-day german union :)
I'm starting to think there is no Spider sense, just a voice in the back of his head.
Eli_Berlin XD thanks :)

/me lurk hugs puffmuffins while he wasn't looking
yay
GilDash, okay then I tell you how to do it: hit your head with a sledgehammer until you start to see ponies. But beware: You wil never be able to return...
Wrek: Us? Silent? Not happening anytime soon. :D
rofl
Invi: ... I'm desperate, not insane, silly. :p
I would like too meet a brony while i'm here; I have a feel, that a real live brohoof feels much more awesome than a viritual one /)
08,01fuck Filly
08,01when i first got into MLP, i was in Germany
Fuck Filly?
You can't go fucking fillies... :S
08,01first time i went to buy blind bags, all i could find was fucking Filly
Panda: it's a MLP rippoff sold everywhere in middle europe
GilDash, then ask holy Dio ^^
I'm thinking of getting Guns Of Icarus Online. Someone else already playing it? I need some reassurance before.
Eli_Berlin, what?
Wrek: What class are you?
08,01RIP Dio
^
Invi: Hmm... ritual to commune with Dio, eh?
Dies-ish
Aye, RIP Dio.
The best word
08,01i have a dog called Ozzy
Panda: yeah it reminds of 3.6 a lot
Eli_Berlin, I really dont follow
08,01Invi: he actually does
Ozzy... I don't know how he's still rocking, yet alone how he's still alive, but he's bloody awesome anyway. :)
Love his accent.
i'm wondering whether or not to try out end of nations o.O
Panda: imagine fake MLP toys that look like 3.6. combine it with your worst nightmare, and there you have "Filly"
08,01GilDash: coincidentally, i've just been listening to Sabbath Bloody Sabbath
08,01you may hate me for it, but it's actually one of my favourite albums
Yeah, Filly REALLY looks a lot like 3.5
Eli_Berlin, hm.. as long as it isnt g3.5 scoots... im fine
Panda: it's close
08,01to which i will reply: only by a small margin
I haven't either GilDash
and by that I mean barely at all
08,01GilDash: i got my mum into Sabbath; she now has 5 Sabbath CDs in her car, which she listens to when she drives
08,01it's become her car music
I know Paranoid, obviously though. XD
Panda: but the best part about it is; the shelves in the stores are full of them, but no MLP FIM
Eli_Berlin, hm... that does suck >.<
08,01picture that: tiny little old indian lady in a silver 4x4 listening to Sabbath
lol all the good one are taken?
08,01loudly.
08,01it's possibly the best thing ever
I wonder what we have here, but I haven't even looked
they all got the MLP one and left the others
Giggled.
this was officially the first time i got sarcasm over the internet and the other person noticed it :) success
kinda afk
08,01http://i.imgur.com/ZoIkd.gif

cya
I took 2 years in High school but I barely know any now
Invi: i don't like them either. but from time to time a trance club or a drum and bass concert can't hurt. (lies it hurts like hell. don't go to pendulum if you don't wanna get hurt.)
yay a pony :)
Ded.
Eli_Berlin: Pendulum are fine. Just get your mosh on. XD
I can't decide whether you should live or die~
Eli_Berlin, I would want to go to Wacken, but it's already sold out :<
Pendulum? PENDULUM?! Pendulum. <3
Kammerjunk: Living would be preferable, please.
GilDash: i've been so sore after my past 2 pendulum concerts :)
Kammerjunk, Oh you'll probably go to heaven, please don't hang your head and cry.
Oh, you'll probably go to Heaven. Please don't hang your head and cry.
I wonder why.
Consarnit.
Ninjazz: ever seen them live?
:D
Eli_Berlin: Yeah, I go to Download every year. Huge metal/rock festival. I've lost two pairs of glasses there. XD
Eli_Berlin, I WISH.
Ninjazz, you ninja.
Ninjazz: they are sooo freaking awesome. but don't try to walk for the week after
Ninjazz, I have my very, very rare moments.
I have never been on a Concert before, but I really wanna go on one of the Symphonic Concerts in Colocne once in my life -.-
Ninjazz dat self ping?
oh hey, its wreky who is broadcasting :3
Eli_Berlin, you can't stop me from trying!
not the coffee!
Panda, hmmm?
Ninjazz: You should go see them. They're not exactly my thing, but live they're amazing.
coffee's too mainstream. try colas :P
I live on an island. .-. opportunities are low.
I do like a good cup of coffee.
^
Ninjazz: whenever they are in the country my best firend an I are there :P
Ninjazz: Come over to the UK! I'm sure I can sort something out. ^_^
Ninjazz: which is way to rarely. they are in the UK and US now
Ninjazz: in autumn and winter here it's almost a ghost town. Thankfully we live close to the town center
Eli_Berlin, GilDash, Mum says we're going to Europe next year. This.... works.
Ninjazz: You must come see me!
Ninjazz: No buts!
MadSurge, I like quiet.
O-o
I just derped?
Ninjazz: If only it was hot AND quiet :D
You dun derp.
Ninjazz: they don't yet have much of a plan on their site for next year, but sure come over :)
GilDash, I'll think about it. :>
Kammerjunk, now you done fucked up.
MadSurge, cold and quiet sounds better. :c
Ninjazz: europe where? England?
Eli_Berlin, MadSurge, all over apparently.
Knowing her though, I'm probably heading over to Angle Land too.
you are dead. not big surprise
BRB
Ninjazz: if you come to switzerland once i volonteer as a guide :)
Ninjazz: Hooray! ^_^
Why so excited?
Eli_Berlin, oh I might take your offer.
Ninjazz, come with me to englad :3
Ninjazz: Extreme boredom, probably. :D
GilDash, oh. :D
Panda, you're going to?
too*
Ninjazz, uh...I wasnt aware that you were first XD
All the bronies comeing to England? So be it! XD
To Switzerland I go
GilDash: yay, we'll come visit you :D\
Hmm... wonder if I should be taxi service again...?
Applejack2012: sure come over :) we have some nice sceenes here
Ninjazz, well... I have a family member there. So, I'll be visiting him for a little bit ^^
Applejack2012: well, right now i'm in germany, but you catch what i mean
Panda, when?
Ninjazz not sure, before next year for sure :)
hopefully
if I can get over my fear of flying
So like Deciembre?
/me is a scootaloo
00,10hey wrek I got the beta code!
/me flies evrytiem.
Panda: Sitting in a big metal contraptions thousands of metres above the ground for a few hours? What could go wrong?
contraption*
Panda: i was worried too. this here was my first flight (since i was 2). but it was really chill¨. the turbulences were even fun :)
I'm a Scoot too
Afraid of heights and cant swim... I dont wanna be stuck on this continent for the rest of my life!!!
Kammerjunk: They're very safe really.
Oh, I know.
Not my first rodeo.
Of course, that all depends on the pilot.
Kammerjunk, you arent helping /)_(\
:D
Panda, then come to germany :D
It's more being sat for hours... unable to move... -_-
Invi that still requires flying, I'm in the US
/me cant fly
GilDash sounds exciting
Last time I flew, I had my Nintendo DS.
'Twas a while back.
Panda then take a boat ^^
Dken2021, it's not.... It's not even funny.
I haven't flown in 5 years
Invi i cant swim, so I have a natural fear of water....
Dken2021: Oh, it's a right laugh...
aaanyways, if anyone comes to switzerland any time soon, hit me up. i can get you from the airport & everything. i kinda know this country. (easy, since it's no bigger than most of your cities alone)
Panda, I know that feel ^^ maybe i gona visit you somewhen whgen i gotz time and monies ^^
The best thing on a plane is to break out your laptop and mess with the battery.
Eli_Berlin, as long as you dont wanna get me drunk just to steal my organs and leave me to die in the middle of the road... im fine ^^
Invi dat would be awesome D:
:D*
Hi!
Panda: damn it, you got my plan :(
hey Barbetos
hi Barbetos ^^
hullo barbetos
Barbetos, arent you a jamacian city?
I am in a awfully good mood today, and I am worried. I must need to go see a doctor or something like that.
Eli_Berlin ;) great minds think alike.
wait
>.>
<.<
Barbetos maybe that's a good thing
Enjoy your good mood :)
Panda: i'm never gonna visit you, that's for sure...
>good mood
>sure sign of some illness
sounds like the best illness ever
Actually. I was really happy to spot a tube of tooth paste with pinkie pie on it.
Barbetos, you took your happy doses, nothing is wrong :D
Its the small things really.
Barbetos WHERE!
gimme
morning killerpony7733
killerpony7733: Holla! :)
hmmm
hello
pinkie pie
It was with the tooth paste here at my local wal mart. It almost stoled my money when I saw it
+ toothpaste
Oh, Walmart. Why you not in Denmark.
Panda GilDas Darnit you two and your IRC clients :D
Come on and smiole
smile
But seriously. I spot a pony, and my life is instantly awesome. Ponies are awesome.
killerpony7733: We're so cool. XD
hey there killerpony7733
Barbetos, its not stealing if you want it~
hey
If that happened here...
killerpony7733, think you spelled a name wrong there XD
Five finger discount.
I'd probably react the same
Panda, it actually is, no matter if you want it or not ^^
Panda Ya think? :P
And before you ask, I do have five fingers. None of that four fingers and a thumb.
Invi: Can you explain the banker bailout to me then, please? XD
killerpony7733 :P nope, when do I ever think?
Barbetos, wasnt gonna ask. I have hooves, umad?
*gasp*
AJIsAwesome!
Panda! :)
Panda with hooves. No.. not mad. I am just wondering how life works that way, for a panda I mean.
Hi, everyone! How are you all today? :)
Confusion. Yep. Confused.
Barbetos, panda with hooves :)
Hi AJIsAwesome !
See you all in a bit. :)
hi
GilDash, you have to apply your law violation to the gouvernment and tehy decide if it is a legit law violation *cough* corruption *cough*
So... I never got to know-- what server is this?
Invi: Oh, it's open corruption in all but name.
/me hugs Wirisme and Applejack2012 :)

Pretty good, alexxm. How about you? :)
Ha ha! The entertainment has been doubled!
is there still a stream because i have nothing on my end
05yes there is
i'm good AJIsAwesome
Hi.
Hey Pinkielover123.
hi
Oh yeah. Are you Alliance or Horde?
?
cya
Alliance, Horde... These Pandas are all the same to me
Hi, Pinkielover123 :)
Wait, that didn't come out right.
FOR LORDERON.
(sp)
I see a desktop pony.
Lordaeron?
And I haven't played WC3 in ages.
Yes, ty Kurra.
Hoof up if you play WoW as much just to see the beauty of the world, than to play it. .)
(\
(\ (used to play)
Does it count if I would /want/ to but don't?
yeah?
well, finally have Shin Onigashima Arrangement Uploaded :)
/)
why dont you play it Ninjazz ?
Also hoof up if you spent time in the Metroid Prime worlds just to explore their beauty too, as well as play /)
13hate mornings like this... so much sneezing...
I used to play WoW.
Ninjazz: you mean monthly payments?
Ninjazz Haha WC3 was my first online game and i remember playing sooooo many customs maps
TILL THEY ADDED PANDAS.
twilight_sprinkle, eyup. Also didn't want to waste money when my internet was pretty crap.
/me whispers to Ninjazz "private serveeeeeeers....."
killerpony7733, Custom matches... Oh my God the sustom matches. I got SO good at tank battles.
twilight_sprinkle, did that too. Lost interest.
/me grabs scrubby cloth, bath c|
13then everything changed when the panda nation attacked
Ninjazz: why?
twilight_sprinkle, not sure. Just... didn't click with me. :/
Yes shizuka.
Buffer.
what side are the pandas on
I don't see why people complain. Pandas have been in the WC universe since WC3 and NO ONE complained then.
Ninjazz Yep so many maps i loved like you know the war of azeroth maps and all where you took a faction and area and you played out the natural events of the lore and even so could just change it entirely :D
Ninjazz Yeppers
I don't like pandas.
Lagging.
killerpony7733, Oohh mai god the nostalgia.
Bronystate lags alot for me.
/me Eats a muffin " True story."
Remember when all there was to play was DOTA maps?
pandas are evil, they kill you and steal our corpse if you dont buy their cheese
ew dota
LOL TWILIGHT.
I gave it a shot. People started kicking when they /ping'd me. -_-
dota would be more fun if not for the community
Ninjazz Oh and titan defense or whatever it's called where you choose a builder race and you setup defenses and bases and steal gold from the titan and advance tech and hopefully have a undestroyable base
"GU!" "GU!"
so what do the pandas do that are differant
killerpony7733, hahaha yeah! God I sucked at that one.
alexxm: theyre big and fluffy!:3
I miss desktop ponies,
Also, LOAPs.
Ninjazz Too many maps that i just really liked.
What happened to the website?
Ninjazz Oh god those!
killerpony7733, IKR.
And I come back to... is that Soundgarden?
Ninjazz I remember always running the mayor job cause it mean't free money and i didn't do squat
killerpony7733, drug lord all day every day.
Pinkielover123: ?
You said pandas are evil.
Ninjazz: smokin weed erryday
Always hilarious when my daughter decides to side with the cops and take my empire. >_<
OH NO BUFFER.
twilight_sprinkle, drugs make you powerful.
Pinkielover123: i know, but you said something happened to the website
Yeah.
05Pinkielover123: you seem to be the only one with buffer
Testing.
I cant find it.
05so stop complainign 24/7 theres nothign i can do about it
Pinkielover123: which site?
Ninjazz Yeah i remember them. Sometimes one of those players got too powerful and just trolled the heck out of ya, but it was rather balanced out since the police got them
Desktop ponies.
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: One Day One Dollar Donation Drive for Kiki's Cancer Fund
Pinkielover123: oh, hm let me check
Ninjazz Argh but yes some of the drug lord players for no reason just set a hostile path agaisnt everyone
killerpony7733, yeah. but it ALWAYS sucked when the cops were pricks.
Pinkielover123: huh, youre right, the link to that site doesnt work anymore
Not me. Want drugs, just ask.
Everything was airei.
Ninjazz Hah yeah either way you were screwed by either the police or drug lord but in some cases they were nice and all cool and only kept a war against each other never hurting the other players
Maybe updating...
Testing.
1...2..3.
Pinkielover123: on a different site where you can download it, it says "As of 2012-09-09, this project is no longer under active development."
Aw.
They stopped it.
killerpony7733, I LOVED those games. The one game where peasants could just get a job and stick or stick in away from the general and major conflicts.
That was the most best idea.
Wrek, aight. Thanks for streaming the expansion.
Pinkielover123: yeah, you can still downloaded it from other sites tho
I have browser ponies.
Glad that there was minimal complaining about pandas.
Wrek: More talking! :)
'Twas fun.
I think I just depleted my vocabulary.
xD
Ninjazz Yep but idunno i hated the enforcing and factions that could make soldiers and all so i generally kept to those simple peasants and had a simple job and just stat spammed with drugs. Which reminds me i remember some really awesome guys that asked if you wanted to be allies and they gave you lotsa free drugs to enforce them and you had a pretty damn strong peasant
Tigers.
Tigers everywhere.
killerpony7733: I assume this is a game you're talking about and that you and Ninjazz aren't actual drug runners IRL. XD
heya everypony!
Oh, kill quests.
killerpony7733, it almost got tedious spamming the numberpad button.
GilDash, Custom maps. :>
Ninjazz: Maps for what game?
GilDash WC3 yes and the metric ton of maps that was made at it's time
Oh, I see...
Maps for the map god.
Seeya.
bye Wrek
bye wrek
Lol twilight got mad for the video freezing.
GilDash What were you expecting me and Ninjazz do that stuff? :D
Wrek: See ya! L(
thanks for the stream
*:)
killerpony7733: Hey, I don't expect anything any more. XD
GilDash Hah but yes if you didn
didn't catch it we said we talked about WC3 i get'cha
LOAPs. :3
Bored.
killerpony7733: Well, I knew it was some kind of game, but last I checked WC3 didn't have any drugs, so I didn't make that connection. XD
/me sneaks into the chat
Ninjazz But alas too many custom maps to remember that just were sooooo much damn fun
It had tomes of power snuck into a pipe.
WC3?
i have wc3 frozen throne
=D

/me Comes back with wafflez
/me nosebleeds
dont ever, EVER start a program that is called "escape from lavender town"
how come SNow
Snow: Sonds like a right laugh. XD
its the kind of program that cant be shut down
you have to win the game to shut it down
There. Much better. :)
K.
Can't be shut down? Is that a challenge?
yes
Snow:you have to win the game to shut it down
try shutting it down without using the power button on your pc
Snow:YOU HAVE TO WIN IT TO MAKE IT CLOSE
Okay. Yank the power cable.
Failing that, turn the plug off by the wall.
I win. ^_^
or at least dont press escape
Snow:HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO SAY IT?
that was my fault
NO.
Aww, you can close it by pressing escape? No fun.
and: DONT YELL IN MY EAR PLEASE, IT HURTS
Alt + F4?
Ok.
kammerjunk|TOR: umm, it closes it, temporary
End Process?
Alt + Ctrl + Del?
What's that other one that actually goes direct to task manager these days...?
win the game by going through the whole thing?
right klik on taskbar
click*
Ok.
Click on the esc.
GilDash: Ctrl+Shift+ESC
THE ESC BUTTION.
Kammerjunk|TOR: Aye, that's the one. Thank you.
* button
and then go through the game
Well, I had just finished a TOR quest anyway. Time for Lavender Town.
and then when it ends you can end it
I -could- run it via the browser, but that's hardly as fun.
'Lo everyone.

I wanna play Beta.
'Twas fun, though. Recorded a pony pyramid.

We are trying to get the chat back to normal.

If people are using /me 9 times, that's excessive.
Did you know that DerpStar and I pretty much watched most of Community so she could get that one joke in Anthology II? Something like 16 hours for a 30 second clip...
it alive!
4 times is pretty weak.
Schrödingers chat effect, chat is ded until observed that it is ded.
When in another tab, the chat is simultenously dead and alive
its chat effect 3 all over again
Chat is now offically simultaneously dead and alive until observed.
DoublePint: Ah ha! I thought I recognised you! So you *did* get together with her after all! ^_^
Why not chat wars?
DoublePint: friendship is magic, after all :)
Indeed GilDash !

Kammerjunk|TOR: nevermind sir

Bronysith: .........
There can never be a best pony. :P
Bronysith, nope
its only fav pony, not best pony
But...she throws parties
my fav pony is twilight sparkle

Shizuka stream, YEAAAAH
where is sandvich?
heavy lags here
Kammerjunk: Do you like honey?
WHO TOUCHED MY SANDVICH!?
mips, why you hate germany so much?
CCCP: Doug himself said he will bring the character back for a few special occasions, but the show will not be weekly anymore, that's all
Honey is fairly good.
:'(
Then yeah, try it. Just try not to turn your tea into syrup.
Shizuka, everyone. Pony toys TF style: http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc7/400844_450760454963172_2032489959_n.jpg

Nonthing is there.
J_E_Smith71: WEHRE ARE THESE TOYS?
I don't see anything
Just a bufffer and a black backgroud.

11,02Moo?
I don't see this.
I don't see anything.
At all
who'S streaming
A wild SB appears.
CCCP tell them that always doing that is annoying. If they don't stop, constantly talk about something they like and rant about it
waaaaaaaaait
It's still buffering though
i know this
Meanwhile but i liek them :I
/me glomps Pinkielover123
Brony fix this.
Me and meanwhile don't see the stream.
is my music teacher streaming or sumthing?
ASoftFluffyThing bronies are the ponly thing they rant on
only*
13Maybe you'd prefer no stream at all?
NO.
I want a stream.
Shizuka: Ikr :|
CCCP, well constantly rant about something they like when you're around them
me too
Since I have no stream at all anyway it doesn't really matter.
It's just.
Shizuka: no! no! keep it like this <3
CCCP: I concur with ASoftFluffyThing.
UGH THAT'S IT.
Shizuka: mips seems wakky again. switch embed maybe?
Ragequit?
Still nonthing.
Instruments playing themselves? That's pretty awesome.
ASoftFluffyThing okies :3
OH I SEE SOMETHING.
it'S about 5 secons stream, 10 seconds buffer
*Thing
CCCP, make sure to do it loud as possible
Well, I got it back to buffering every ten seconds instead of constantly...
ASoftFluffyThing :D
brb
These bots are awesome!
What's with this buffering?
so SNow whats that escape from lavender town game you mentioned
alexxm: Entertaining.
Pinkielover123, it's probably mips or your internet connection
My internet is fine.
>_><_< nothing alexxm
http://i.imgur.com/KDhFG.jpg
its buffering for me too
Fix this NAO.
Bronystate.
Because mods = Indentured servents, right?
can they do any kind of music?
Snow, I guess so.
Since they're cgi, probably.
Kammerjunk: it's just mips. does that from tiem to time, fail for no appearant reason
Dark_Horst: Hey, I ain't complainin'.
A wild ScootaChicken appears!
it'S still a problem though. my stream jsut went dead, i'm guessing they're busy changing the embed now
hi ScootaChicken
that or mips died completely
Everyday i'm buffering.
Hello ScootaChicken
/me Plays music
Great, it's taken me like, ten minutes to watch five minutes of this.
Meh, happened when Wrek streamed few days ago too.
Meanwhile, have you tried refreshing the whole page? that sorta helps a tiny bit
Silly mips.
oh, there it is back
13I'm done.
Last time I did that I got nothing at all.
Shizuka: hm?
Huh?
12 seconds without buffering. New record.
Shizuka: Something the matter?
Shizuka: :(
HOLY SHIT A LAZER.
wat
13I'm not going to sit through the entire playlist I prepared watching you all do nothing but whine about it.
13I'm done.
Hope you're satisfied guys :|
Shizuka: we dont whine about the playlist. we just dont get anything here
But we're buffering.
Not really, just we can't see shit.
oh crap we pissed of Shizuka ...i'm a little scared
Heavens, no. It was mips being buggy.
I'm buffering A LOT too, but I'm not bugging about it constantly
^
No need to get pissed off Shizuka.
I second MadSurge's statement
So has it actually stopped? Because mine is still stopping and starting.
Meanwhile: I call magic.
Nothing is streaming at the moment Meanwhile
Oh right so you all can't see anything either but you just felt not saying anything was helpful.
God.
Yeah, I bet that'd be really inspiring. If you didn't point out when something wasn't working.
It was just buffering.
buffering to the point where it wasnt working
How would I have helped saying "it's not working"? You were already saying it
Because if we know that it's not working for everyone we recognise that it's a problem on the streamers end.
Or with the embed. It narrows down the list of solutions.
Dumbass mips.
It's funny how my stream has frozen on the spot where Wrek is looking at me.
CrazyCherry lolwut
well now it doesnt matter cause we pissed of shizu and we get nothing...its our own du,b fault
Or it's her fault for throwing a hissy fit about it.
MadSurge: This channel has been host to whether toilet paper should face the wall or the toilet. I don't think you can expect meaningful conversations all the time, some of it is going to be silly.
*dumb
Kammerjunk, wait wat?
13When the outbound packets are note perfect, it is not a problem on my end.
ASoftFluffyThing: Yup.
Kammerjunk: REALLY?! :D
Kammerjunk: Okay then?
xD
So it's mips? We've had that problem before. What's wrong with fixing it the same way?
It was a strange discussion, but I believe the final result was that the end of the roll should face the toilet.
Shizuka: that's what we're saying here, mips is failing. if you dont ahve another embed you could use, just say so
/me ponders her life
13We have dozens.
13I don't feel like continuing.
Shizuka: why not?
Yeah I need to get out more. Damn you age limit!
Well, that's another matter then.
Because she's moping.
Well, moving on then.
I'm bored/
.*
Anyone seen any good movies lately?
Most of the places here are bars because I live in a college town/city
Since USC owns just about ALL of downtown
Meanwhile: i think the last thing i saw was That's My Boy and that was pretty funny
Most of the places here are boring because I live in a boring city.
BladedWings|HW: Never heard of it, what's it about?
anyone seen this movie yet? http://derpy.me/KFuWS
Dken2021 OH LORD GAWD NO
Smiley, that's the one with Shane Dawson isn't it?
Dken2021: Didn't even know it was out yet.
Meanwhile: Yeah, it's the YouTube celebrity film.
oh it's not out yet? ah, thought it was
With Shane Dawson and Toby Turner.
Meanwhile: Adam Sandler as a kid has sex with his teacher, they have a kid...the kid at a certain age decides to leave his family and change his name cause he is embarrass by the dad
Well on the one hand I question any film using youtube 'celebs' but on the other it actually looks sort of interesting.
oh, looks like it'll be out next week
Dken2021: I think that if the face was completely blank it would have been scarier :D
Meanwhile: It quite possibly features Shane Dawson dying.
I sure hope so.
BladedWings|HW: Sounds...odd.
Meanwhile: the rest of the moive is them trying to work things out and be a family again
Kammerjunk: True that could be a plus.
Let's watch bad movies! :D
Dken2021: i might wanna see that
Let's watch North!
Shane Dawson. Eh.
BladedWings|HW: what genre is it?
11,02Refresh embed everypony :)
oh god, the premise sounds silly. He can be summoned from the internet XD
Meanwhile: comedy duh
Suddenly, LimeV.
BladedWings|HW: Don't "duh" me, that doesn't sound very comedic.
Bey everypony
bye CCCP
11,02Later CCCP :)
Meanwhile, hahahalol
seeya CCCP
Bye CCCP
CCCP: Do svidaniya.
Oh, we've got something now.
Meanwhile: It may not sound a lot like comedy, but Adam Sandler.
Why did Nintendo make their Gamecube discs soooooo damn tiny
also this is a very misleading poster http://derpy.me/KFuWS
Dken2021: How come?
Kammerjunk: Oh he's considered funny? That'd be why I was confused.
ASoftFluffyThing: to fit the drive
Meanwhile: I understand that.
cube shape and all
Kammerjunk it implies sonic has a bigger role in the movie
Dken2021: What does Sonic have to do with Smiley?
hello again everyone :) I see NewSuperBronyU sis streaming
Meanwhile: sorry for the confusion XD
11,02They made it smaller to combat piracy
Kammerjunk no, two different films
Dken2021, a CUBE can make an awesome portable speaker. <.<
Dken2021: You just linked me to Smiley, though.
NewSuperBronyU, has that even worked?
11,02Kind of
Kammerjunk oh, sorry
Dken2021: You silly filly.
Dken2021: is it really goofy horror?
^
"there is a guy with a knife, stupid teenagers die"
MadSurge he can be summed from the internet
I'm only watching it to see Shane Dawson possibly get brutally murdered.
*summoned
oh look, paper mario
I recall a film that summoned the evil of the moment via ringtone on a cell.
Was rather meh.
hi Everypony :)
hey thelonepony
Hi thelonepony
Is NewSuperBronyU Playing :3
hi thelonepony
ya
thelonepony: Salve.
Salve?
Salve, ciao, buongiorno thelonepony :D
Ooh, anyone seen 1408?
Nope
thelonepony: It's a Latin greeting. Bit formal, I suppose, but what the heck.
Meanwhile: the cursed room movie?
MadSurge: aye that's the one.
One of my favourites.
hai thelonepony ^^
Meanwhile: seen it!
anyways, this was what I was talking about being misleading, ralph isn't even in the poster http://derpy.me/4Xd-t
how are things thelonepony
....is that mario with round based rpg combat system?
wat?
Dken2021: You must not have seen the other posters.
stream!
Dken2021: Oh, that one. I'll be excited to watch that one when I can finally download a 720p/1080p version of it.
hi Invi MadSurge Kammerjunk ASoftFluffyThing Dken2021 alexxm :)
11,02Dark_Horst: You never played Paper Mario before? o.o
Dken2021: I see the Samus expy :$
Doing Great alexxm and You?
Dark_Horst, shame on you
NewSuperBronyU: i dont have consoled
I'm not even a particularly big Nintendo fan, and I've still played Paper Mario.
*consoles
11,02Or rather Super Mario RPG ><
Meanwhile oh, my mistake then
yeah well, no consoles
MadSurge: Best part is that bit in the vents.
Ooh, Wreck-It Ralph has John Reilly as lead voice.
11,02Kammerjunk: Brule's Rules :P
Eeyup.
Meanwhile: I liked when the room faked him out being outside again
MadSurge: Troll room is best room.
TROLL COLUMNS
hehe dat pow block
So is the plot of this that Bowser has kidnapped the princess?
Meanwhile: Are you some sort of sorcerer?
Mage, perhaps? Surely you have the ability to scry.
Played the first Paper Mario, still haven't got to the ice fortress boss
Kammerjunk: Well let's face it, noughts and crosses are harder to figure out than the plot of a Mario game.
MadSurge, I found that cloud monster harder ^^
I never did figure out the plot of noughts and crosses.
Invi: I didn't even reach it, I mean :D
MadSurge, oh ok ^^
Bowser's battle was epic .__.
hey everypony :) just got Rayman,ah i remember this Paper Mario & the 1000 yr door :O such a good game!
hi Sketch_Toku_Brony
hai Sketch_Toku_Brony ^^
Hi Sketch_Toku_Brony :3
Hi Sketch_Toku_Brony
and Rayman, nice
Meanwhile: let's just say that later the plot becomes a little different from "Bowser kidnaps the Princess" :D
11,02Which Rayman game? o.o
MadSurge: Really? Does someone else kidnap her instead?
MadSurge: Peach kidnapped Bowser?
NewSuperBronyU: Origins in Vita
11,02Actually, Bowser hasn't kidnapped the princess at all yet. She's just out looking for the treasure.
Hey everypony
:D
11,02Sketch_Toku_Brony: Awesome :D I love that game ;A;
And suddenly, Thousand year door
hi Serenity
hi Serenity :)
Was Mario peeing in the bushes therE?
there*
Oh so Bowser hasn't kidnapped her /yet/
:D
But...he does.
THOSE THINGS' FACES
So basically it's "Mario faffing around for a bit before the thing you knew was coming happens"
Hahaha
Poison
Oh.
:L
Well props for at least adding to the basic story outline.
BOOOOOO
trololol
°w° hello everpony...
Hi Sonny
Heus, Sonny.
yay responds! :)
'Lo Sonny.
hay Sonny and NewSuperBronyU what are you doing behind that bush....? >.>
Consarnit, Mario, could you hold it for 5 minutes.
hi Sonny
Invi: Something involving that female Goomba probably. Best left unsaid.
Mario has a busy timeline
NewSuperBronyU, dat poor bush! :<
hi Sonny
Never any time to go for a piss
I think I just revived the chat and nothing much Invi >_>
Faffing is an awesome word. lol
Yeah, a British word :]
Super stop pounding the Goomba in the bush and get back to playing. :P
Barbetos: It is.
Meanwhile: I thought the way that bush was shaking looked suspicious.
I am actually searching got someone that had the name The_engineer, 2 days ago, on this site
Can asomepony help me :D?
Meanwhile: these games are made by the same team that makes the Fire Emblem games, so they made RPGs with Mario rather than the other way around
11,02Meanwhile: Moo ><
nobody seen him or anything D:?
Sonny: Are you sure he didn't erect a teleporter and got out of here?
NewSuperBronyU There is a female goomba following you. KILITKILITKILITKILITKILITKILITKILIT
Kammerjunk: well the thing is I drew him a picture and now he isn't on to see it <_<
so, yeah
11,02Barbetos: o u
kinda, waste of time then >_>
Grr, my internet is being shitagain
Sonny: Well, ain't that a kick in the head.
Kammerjunk: exactly :/
No really kill it before anyone else sees it. That is not canon!
brb guys, gonna go wash some dishes
No stream here
OR IS IT JUST ME
11,02You have to press play :)
You are missing out on some serious paper mario action.
Sonny: The_Engineer was idpmdhilcd@2.49.khg.wnh and last logged in about 7 hours ago. Try tomorrow, a bit earlier.
Dark92Enigma: there is a stream
NewSuperBronyU Do I have to Press Play ... on Tape ?
Sonny: Or a lot later, whichever.
Rewind the tape with a pencil.
NewSuperBronyU: speaking of Rayman Origins,do ya have it on your wii?
:O THWOMP BOSS
Press Start Lil_B
Then Select
BladedWings|Dishes: my stream doesn't say so, it says ''we are doing maintenance''
Shhwonk.
Kammerjunk: uhm, you seem to have talked to him
Shhwonk is clearly the sound that makes.
Dark92Enigma: odd...refresh?
Dark92Enigma you're dooomed to see that screen for a few months
:D
Sonny: No, I just did a /whowas
QUIZ SHOW
Kammerjunk: oh
i know cause i had it
So i'll be off for a while until it comes back
No! Lil_B I figured it out. Press Up Up Down Down Left Right Left Right B A Start.
Well that was unexpected.
wait, wat?
Barbetos I think it was Left, left/down, down and heavy Punch ...
Sorry I don't play rap games.
Barbetos that was Streat Fighter 2 :P
oh limeV pulling out support of countries as random without saying anything to anyone
Let's play a game of rap
a rap game?
Chat rap battle.
Lil_B: I think it was up up down down left right left right B A START.
I thought LimeV always goofed for you.
Kammerjunk too bad you were playing Gradius III
it came back like a month ago
oh Kammerjunk would you like to see what I drew for him :D?
Oh, wait. I just realised that joke was just made.
I am so slow.
Ah. That blows.
Lil_B: Never heard of it.
Sonny: Sure.
Rap battle? I liked the Gandalf vs Dumbledore one
here it is
now i just think they put/remove support at random becuase their servers can't handle it
Lil_B: Wait, that's a lie. Rings a bell.
FUZZIES
Lil_B: Don't think I ever played a lot of it, but certainly rings a bell.
ello
Kammerjunk Gradius, well knows shmup from Konami :)
oh god, i keep forgetting
no links while stream D:
Mayhaps. Do they have anything useful in the manner of support?
Sonny: Oh, picture links are fine.
No VIDEO Links Sonny
oh really?
YAAAAAAAY
THIS CHAT IS DEAD.
nope send them a message they never respond
Specifically, no non-image links while a stream is playing.
nononono thelonepony it's a pic
it's a pic
no worries :D
i think
and hope >_>
my best shot was finding the url to the direct stream and watch it on their site
Sonny: As per usual, I am saddened by my absolute disablity of drawing ponies. But I like it.
:D
I always Mess up
:d
I blame the chests.
Sonny sometimes it reeally depends on the mod atm, some say "No Links During Streams" most say "only pictures during streams" others say "anything BUT Video Links during streams"
Helpful bunch. :/
And ATM, it's SB. He's just a silly filly, so no problems thar.
Kammerjunk: ye don't worry it's not like I couldn't do any better it's just a quick pic to show what I could do, but ye he logged out
:/
yes :)
and I get it Lil_B thanks :D
For those that don't get it: you can prevent your party from getting some damage by pressing a button at the same moment you get damaged.
11,02i liek silleh \:3/
Wait, SB can't be a silly filly. Crazy colt?
11,02O.O
NewSuperBronyU: I like silleh 2 :3
11,02I am silleh ;^;
Fuzzies' timing is particularly tricky
Okay, you're silly D:
/me glomps Sonny
wait what's glomping :o?
is it like hugging :)?
/me glomps Sonny
ok, I need to go, bye everybody :)
It's like a rugby tackle combined with a hug.

Sonny: Hug/tackle hug.

Sonny: a tackle hug :)

group glomp! \o/
so pretty much if anyone gets that " we are doing maitance" BS their best and probably only shot is to go to http://limev.com/bronystate2 and watch there until they feel like putting support back for the embed on their region
Title on limev.com: LimeV

HEY I have a brony-to brony question to ask you,my friend is coming over tommorow,one time on MC i had a pony shirt and he said "Why do you have a pony shirt" and i said Cause its funny ( a stupid excuse) and he said it mAKes me look gay. He Does not know about bronys,but implies they are gay. Since then i have really grown on the fanbase and have pony stuff on my XBOX,desktop and even around my room it is so much im too lazy to remove
Leave it
Suddenly block of text.
They can deal
idk
and if they don't, stab them with something
^
I suggest BLADES OF CHAOS
Preferably sharp.
Oh god dang
Kammerjunk, why not a rusty knife
Or for actually useful advice...
Super Mario Thousand year door
11,02Pink3: I'd tell your friend to grow up.
Paper Mario even
derp
ASoftFluffyThing: You make a good point.
Stallion_of_War: Im not stabbing him he is one of my best friends T_T
Yeah that works.
Pink3 say it's your sister room or tell him you're a brony and deal with it
Pink3: Stab him!
DO it
NewSuperBronyU: OH U
the music in this game is catchy..
Pink3: well, you can always beat him with something
That's also an option.
Sorry... useful advice: Leave it and let them deal with it
Pink3, well tell him that it does look gay because gay means happy.
Pink3, deflect insult!
^
Pink3: tell him youre gay
Use mantis kung fu!
NewSuperBronyU: hmmmmm maybe and TheGreatAndPowerfulT I dont have a sis
ASoftFluffyThing: *slow clap*
http://twentypercentcooler.net/data/aa/1a/aa1a479706edf9b7af1d4dbb1a8ff4f8.gif?1316310493
Shut UP twilight_sprinkle
Am I really coming in here in the middle of a drama?
Pink3: but srsly, if hes your friend, he should be able to deal with it
Pink3 then deal with it that's you only option
Ok
Well you know, either tell him you like it and roll with it, or hide it suavely.
MadSurge, I did good?
Pink3: Before he arrives, put sunglasses in your pocket (preferrably similar to the ones Discord owns), and if he says anything, pull them out, put them on, and say deal with it.
ASoftFluffyThing: yes. oh my god you did well. :D
MadSurge, deflect insult, gain awesome points
/me Uses humor to diffuse the situation.
Stallion_of_War: lol YES :D
/me it's totally effective
Stallion_of_War: oh crap you cut the wrng wire!..
stabs Stallion_of_War
:)
>stabs
wear like 3 pony shirts and if he says one is gay, take it off to reveal the next one under it.

Terrifying castle? Sounds like a job for an unemployeed italian plumber on shrooms.

No. Other. Option.
He's shown he's the best man for the job
Princess Peach needs to invest in some locks.

You know its kind of funny I would bring up shrooms. I found some in my yeard after mowing it, and my first reaction was "I wonder if I could eat those and have a good trip. Or die."

NewSuperBronyU: still no money here FUUUUUUUUUUUUU
NewSuperBronyU: >.>
til the end of the world
that long for pones? it'll always be too long for me O.O
46 days until...nothing of any real importance.
Oh yeah. The money that I would spend on a Wii U? Its going towards and i7 system.
NewSuperBronyU: would you rather have the new wii in 46 days or half-life 3?
King of the Hill, yaay
05SANDWICH
Wii U
So moist and delicious
why would you waste money on i7 if some AMD are the same and way cheaper???
Cuase I would rather Half Life 3 be done right, than done soon.
cachi01 because i7s are faster
Barbetos: assuming its done right
even at the same clock speed
Won't it be funny when Half Life 3 comes out and it sucks.
11,02I hate Half-Life
south park :)
Wat.
mature content. yay, mature content
All that waiting, all that anticipation, and then it just blows goats.
Meanwhile: yeah i think 60% of the players would commit suicide
NewSuperBronyU: >.>
cachi01 honestly that is probably what is going to happen anyways, but I just want to build an i7 system.
Meanwhile, it wouldn't be surpising
NewSuperBronyU: o u
oh no :D this episode
surprising**
cachi01: i7 may have less GHz but they're WAY more effecient
O.O
NewSuperBronyU, can you turn the volume up a little
Anyone getting sound in only one earbud?
SafariMonkey: all this processor stuff is GIVING ME HEADACHES
dat intro
AJIsAwesome: i got in both, just quietly, and one of my buds sucks so
brown noise
Okay. I got the feel dumb right now. I hear the xbox on stream and I think, "Is my Xbox on?"
lol south park yes :D
taht one's funny
Barbetos: I've had i7 for 1 3/4 years now
Sound only in one ear anyone?
yepp
Ohai guys :)
i'm back, what did i miss?
I'm using a AMD FX-8120. Its not as good as an intel, but I'm happy with it :3
SafariMonkey I have had my current build for about.. 3 years I think.

NewSuperBronyU: theres probably a legitament reason for that
NewSuperBronyU: I've never played the Half Life series, but why do you hate it?
SafariMonkey It is a 955 black edition, with a ATI 6970 currently.
14 gigs of ram. I know its a strange number.
Barbetos: Nice.
Oh, sorry MaxTheBrony. I can't help you with that. :$
Ah its allright :)
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Bronies for Good: Redheart's Roundup II Concludes!

Barbetos: You never really need more than 8 in a modern system

11,02I don't care for the Half-Life series is all. I played Half-Life 2 and it was boring for me.
pony blood is canon?

NewSuperBronyU: Okay, now that makes sense. Thank you. :)

^
^^
v
>
It's a good game, but it's not something I would "love".
NewSuperBronyU: I found half life and half life 2 boring, but the episodes were REALLY fast paced and fun to play.
That's a sweet briefcase...
harbucks....

lmao
dafuq
He did not pay!

11,02I did like playing with Barry the Barrel in HL2 on stream :)
hi Cades
Half life 2 is a horrible game. But I love the physics!
=D
btw that was sarcasm. I fucking make love to half life 2 whenever I can.
^ how do i know that wasnt sarcasm
^
Barbetos: I was about to say :3
:p
NewSuperBronyU, Haaay
^ how do i know that wasnt also sarcasm
the physics are the best part of valve
lol kenny
11,02ASoftFluffyThing: HAAAAAI :D
v
Coffee in a nutshell.
NewSuperBronyU, so that was you playing with Barry the Barrel after BMN?
i dont think that's caffeine they drank
that happens when I drink one cup of coffee
coffee beans?
x.x
always
11,02ASoftFluffyThing: Yesh, you remember that? o3o
O.O
You are just going to have to guess and follow up with the appropriate response. If you fail the anger of the internet shall be released upon you 10 fold.
NewSuperBronyU, was Distric 9 the A movie for the night and Labrynth the B movie?
:D ew
:D
lol
11,02Yeah
NewSuperBronyU *le gasp* THAT WAS MY FIRST BMN
11,02I honestly would play it some more if I could find my copy of The Orange Box on the Xbox 360 still
There he is :O
NewSuperBronyU: And will be my 1 year cakeday!
How do they not notice that.
11,02ASoftFluffyThing: YAY :D
i hate TF2 on the ps3 :/
NewSuperBronyU: Nostaaaaalgia! I mis Barry!
ps3 has tf2?
BLOOD!
>TF2 that is not on PC
thisguy: yes
Well there's your problem.
TF2 sucks when it's not on PC.
^
/me tackle glomps NewSuperBronyU for bringing back awesome memories

Night ekips
we only have 5 maps

and everyone chooses dustbowl
hi cades
i wonder how many maps the pc version has... i mean, the full version
or 2Fort
hey
the other maps re just there for decorration
decoration*
i guess, maybe
Everyone chooses Dustbowl or 2Fort on the regular servers anyway, but damn.
I do, but I'm still not thrilled about moving
also, the controls arent exactly nice to me. aiming's always off whenever i play
and we only have 2 gamemodes
i cant wait to try pc version someday
Yeah I wouldn't be thrilled either
just need to get my own comp, get steam. and start playing
thisguy It is when you're sniping, although, I've gotten the hang of using a controller for TF2
0_o how do they NOT notice?! lol
I do really well as a sboo.
That makes me want to play Dwarf Fort for some reason.
