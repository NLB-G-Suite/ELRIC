MLP's existence before G4 wasn't as controversial as it is now.

I second MadSurge's statement
Yeah, I bet that'd be really inspiring. If you didn't point out when something wasn't working.
It was just buffering.
buffering to the point where it wasnt working
How would I have helped saying "it's not working"? You were already saying it
Because if we know that it's not working for everyone we recognise that it's a problem on the streamers end.
Or it's her fault for throwing a hissy fit about it.

FUZZIES
ello
no links while stream D:
Mayhaps. Do they have anything useful in the manner of support?
oh really?
YAAAAAAAY
Specifically, no non-image links while a stream is playing.
it's a pic
no worries :D
i think
and hope >_>
my best shot was finding the url to the direct stream and watch it on their site
:D
I always Mess up

I blame the chests.
Helpful bunch. :/
