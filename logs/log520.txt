Drugs, prostitution, sell kidney

All they showed that was significant in English was that the guitar leader's name is Roxie
and yeah
Hey Ninjazz

11,01No. It's taking advantage of markets.
Ninjazz! *tackles*

Nittany_Discord: What do you mean , taking advanatge ?
Nitt ah, i think i get it

Hello Evevyone.
Oof.
Good to see you too, Sylandest. ^^
Hey, Alister[M]
Videofreak1127[M]: what's up ?
/me hugs Ninjazz tight :)
Nittany_Discord: then maybe you shouldn't do it.
Stallion_of_War: no
/me plays the KH3D demo
Alister[M]: Kinda sad I missed all the action. I was playing tf2
so
Videofreak1127[M]: action ?
I can't think of to many legal, morally objectional things
that make money
first time touching a KH game ;D
Alister[M]: You know what I mean
apparently holding Kyubey makes you high?
lottery tickets?
Videofreak1127[M]: Maybe we need to speak in private about this
Would it be possible to extend the campaign by a few more weeks?
and a lesbian?
11,01I wouldn't do anything illegal or sexual for money.
Possibly.
11,01Or even think about it.
LOL
/me hugs Sylandest back and says, "btw, hey panda." ^^
:)
Maid prostitution? ohgog
this is very Tim Burtonlike
Nittany_Discord: i kid i kid

Creating a temperal paradox to tell your father to invest in Apple and Microsoft :o

BACK! :)
11,01My dad would hide the money.
wb Ponies47
Nittany_Discord: going around "fixing" your neighbors computers and charging high even if it doesnt need to be fixd?
Nittany_Discord, I ask for your hand in this dance of ponies on this beautiful night. :3
11,01He's a greedy asshole.
11,01He used to not be.
Thanks MahBoi777 :)
Create a temeral paradox to go back in time and tell MY father to invest in Apple and Microsoft, creating a legality clause naming you a 50% partner?
omnipony, Wrek's drawing some Fluttershy
Nittany_Discord: well that sucks
sweet.
11,01All he'll do now is ask me for money.
Wrek: whats with the black?
Irish_Pony shades
Or go back and give a hungry Bill Gates a cheeseburger for part ownership of Microsoft?
Irish_Pony: he's going to blur it to make a shade
ah
11,01No-one on my mom's side of my family likes my dad anymore.
11,01So, it's cool.
whobey
11,01I'm supposed to have moved home, but I'm still in PA with a dead car and still unpacked.
/me sleeps
11,01*sigh* Wrek, when are you going to draw me?
I feel the need to create something like the PZRT but for bronies... Pennsylvania Brony Responce Team?
Kyubey = Tails
SCC calls it "QB"
YES
/me draw me like one of your Fleur ponies?
lol
hmm
05well knowing your OC would be a start
Alright, night everyone. Have fun with the stream.
05also this song is very promising
11,01I gave it to you.
Wrek I has my oc ready :3
Night Reikim
For the LONGEST time I was all "Why is she called Fleur de Lis"... then I googled it...
/me facehoof

I'm losing my mind...
confouded jelly beams
*beans
And I have a lump in my throat
/me 11,01sighs
I don't know what else to do.
11,01I might not bother Rain
I hardly doubt I can go to sleep now...
/me face palms
Oh what am I doing? No one cares.
SCC?
MFW I realized why Fleur was named Fleur - http://i50.tinypic.com/rac4te.jpg
WindWhistler: now wait a tic, I care!
And I can't find the receipts either...
I'll just keep looking until I crack.
WindWhistler: is there anywhere else in the house they might be at? Maybe they were moved around for cleaning?
05well if you cant muster to relink it, then why botehr asking again if i am goign to draw it? it gives the signal that you do not wish for me to draw it
MahBoi777: I'm thinking of a number between 1 - 10
Sylandest: We looked everywhere. The Wii games were reorganized, but we looked there already.
It was with the Wii games.
And the 3DS game...I have no idea...
It's probably thrown out or crushed.
11,01I do. I'm just talking out of depression, frustration, and other negative things.
heh, even in Japanese, Kyubey sounds like a girl
This is hopeless.
God dammit MahBoi777..
05i have 10 ish minutes
05let me atleast sketch something
WindWhistler: if it was with the wii games and resorted, then look where the things that didnt fit with the wii games went
TOY_PON32: is it 7?
11,01http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/803/h51gz.jpg/ <- Here.
/me is dying of boredom
MahBoi777: No 3
Sylandest: We did. We did all that. We looked in my room, we looked in the computer room, we looking in the family room. Everywhere.
11,01Also, I didn't want to push it because I didn't want to annoy you, but I'm in a niffy mood so here.
TOY_PON32: Lol it's k
All these figures I have are now useless. I just wasted $300.
11,01I act fucking weird under depression.
:D
MahBoi777: Now you ask me
WindWhistler: what about spare bags or maybe folders?
BRB :p
Nittany_Discord: It's okay. We're not bothering you
/me hugs Nittany_Discord
Sylandest: Like I said, already looked. Now I have $300 down the drain.
11,01I feel like I'm bothering Wrek.
/me is confuzzled
Don't we all, Nittany_Discord?
11,01No-one here is causing it.
Okay.
hmm?
Nittany_Discord: no your not :( *hugs*
11,01It's just compounding real-life bullshit.
:(
I'll go back to looking even though I'm never gonna find it...
WindWhistler: dont give up yet. When do you think they vanished?
so Ninjazz, How has your vacation been so far?
Om: Tiring.
Don't worry
about a thing
11,01And feeling somewhat abandoned because I'm not getting the help I want moving home.
Cause everylittle thing
is gonna be alright
Ninjazz: Not even a litle bit fun?
11,01No-one at home is helping me with anything.
So how's everyone?
11,01My mom didn't even help promote my charity drive.
11,01She instead wanted me to ask for money.
Sylandest: A few months ago.
hey CrimsonPhoenix! doin good
Nittany_Discord: That's terrible
11,01Which I found very selfish.
And I can't look anymore. I do not have the energy.
I'm just gonna sit here and be depressed.
WindWhistler: oooh...bugger, thats not good. I was gonna say check trash if it was recent, but...darn. I'm sorry :(
Maybe I'll go emo.
...
over 300 dollars?
...
Om: Now that I've gotten into my hotel room it is, before while I was traveling for 20 hours was rather... unfun. And I'm bloody tired right now.
don go emo
/me 11,01hugs WindWhistler
thats a bit extreme
woa there what IS going on in here?
11,01I wouldn't spend it.
Ninjazz: damn.....hope ya sleep well tonight:S
WindWhistler: you bought two copies though, no?
Ninjazz: I'm kinda tired. But nothing like you must be feeling.
what game?
I have 25 figures for a game I don't even have.
/me hugs WindWhistler "I'm sorry"
Gotta figure out how to type in japanese on this browser
Well guys, I'm gonna be a senior in high school. I'm pretty damn excited about it.
Wii 3DS?
so let me rephrase that
Om: I'm used to it... But it's just odd seeing the sun still up so many times in one day.
What game?
TOY_PON32 congrats
CrimsonPhoenix: It's for multiple consoles.
Anybody doing request? :D
What game?
Congrats, TOY_PON32! :)
go emo over an expensive game?
Dken2021: Thanks :)
Thanks Ninjazz
TOY_PON32: same here
To make things worse, I can't simply replace the game.
congrats TOY_PON32
Of course. :)
rawr
WindWhistler i guess you could look for a used copy, so you don't have to pay full price
WHAT GAME
The game comes with three figures.
Ninjazz: That would be fun.
Thanks MahBoi777
Ninjazz: I mean odd :S
/me jumps on Ninjazz
11,01WindWhistler: You can ask the company or the store for a replacement?
Please don't tell me Skylanders
Nittany_Discord: I'd need the receipt. I can't find it.
good afternoon everypony
hey DeathStar
11,01Ouch.
DRF will love madcoke
Om: Coming to the states always has its price, but I'm more worried about having a good connection to get to here.
Unless I went over and showed them all the figures I had. Maybe they'd take pity on me.
ok everytime i tab out i see Wrek working on his "main" potrait...then i see em doing another sketch and i know he's not done with the main...is this like an idea burst of a sketch (draw it right away before its gone?)
WindWhistler so you lost a game?
LOL what makes you say that
good afternoon DeathStar!
so far it's weird
Dken2021: And rendered 25 figures useless.
WHAT GAME?
I wonder if the dubbed version
CrimsonPhoenix: Skylanders.
brb gotta download an app
I just found this site, what goes on here exactly?
is the one with all the stupid retarded edita
edits
no
Those figures cost $10 each.
that include changing lighting and adding gore
Oh
it's a dual audio DVD
You want to play it?
so has both languages
00,10did I lose sound or is the music gone?
:P
Prick: maybe or maybe he got sick of the main one that happens some times too
Great
:v
So I have $250 worth of figures for a game I can't even play.
WindWhistler did you check paces you don't normally go to?
o.o
what
music still goin
Ninjazz: At least you can travel, my family never really has the money for it.
Dken2021: I already told Sylandest this. I looked EVERYWHERE.
こんにちわ
vitrus: welcome ^^ becically we chat while the mods stream what ever they like
yeaah
IT WORKS!!!!
Hey DeathStar
the blue-ray version
i see, im not like being a prick about it :$
Dken2021: aye, she did say so. It's not a good situation, unfortunately
Videofreak1127[M] Konichiwa!
nice
whats he drawing now?
I'm absolutely BAFFLED at how my Wii game disappeared. I never moved it.
haha interesting, and it looks like play movies on friday and sat nights?
omnipony: Nittany's Oc

Om: True. I am thankful for that. Just... a bit... tired, atm. :$
ah. cool ^-^

I'm so exhausted...
They shafted it.

AWW YEAAAH
/me dies
WindWhistler, 1 A lost item has more chance to be found when you're not thinking about it. 2 If you really want it, just get another at a lower price. 3 SKYLANDER? REALLY?
Ninjazz: No problem xD Its understandable.
おはいようごうざいます
CrimsonPhoenix: And here's where I say screw you.
SHAFT drew PMMM
WindWhistler how did you come home with it?
I think that's it
just like PAW drew AB
Hey WindWhistler I gave you 2 advice
/me dances the welcome dance on vitrus s head
Also, I can't just get another copy of the game. it's not possible to get the game alone.
Please use English in here
Hey there, DeathStar.
I'd have to get the figures too.
that's good enough, I just stated my opinion on the game
Back :P
I prefer PAW's animation style
Videofreak1127[M] you must be using google translate
so far
Dken2021: I don't remember. I last played it a few months ago.
I'm not
lol
Chat is so quiet :(
NOPE

13kind of backed myself into a corner since i ended on a 175bpm track >>
I told you
holy crap
GAH! Poeple keep coming in my room! :[
13probably have to scrap half of what i have built up for that to get it right, but i do have a few more good tracks since then
Lots of girl on girl love in that anime

Bobeh: Funny thing about that :$
13CZ3 i was using a base track that's practically in the happy hardcore genre, so yeah >>
Who said that in the anime?
also LOL superwidescreen
expected.. but 175??

*cinemascope
Ponies47; Don't got a door?

Happy Hardcore is more like 180+
its in the dub

11,01Complaining about the stream does hurt the streamers' feeling sometimes.
11,01And it's rude.
I must have missed something: what's making you sick, Alister[M]?
No let's just say the karate man is actually Son-Goku from Dragon Ball. I loved thoose good days.
Very sorry.

SuperBrony64: can you please play metroid prime :) when you can
hmm.. Oh my god. I see why you all say this is.. pretty good.
this game seems like overlord for kids^^
hm
I never really did unsterstand what the story is to this :P
I will never understand this but....
On the first one, he has crashed landed and he needs to go home before his oxygen tank runs out
Just a suggestion, SuperBrony64: you should stream M*A*S*H sometime.
it dosnt look that.. well, but
I'm not complaining.
this is intresting to watch.
I mean, you DO have the entire series on DVD, right?
hm
After getting home, the company has been hit with financial problems. After seeing that the planet had value treasure, the boss sent both Olimar and Loui back to the planet to gain the funds back
I have never seen M*A*S*H :$
I see..
11,02Polydunami: Yup ^-^
So do I :3
This time, he's more prepared, so Olimar and his partner can last there for days
I have M*A*S*H playing cards :)
=/
:O M*A*S*H playing cards!?
eeyup :)

Ponies47 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M*A*S*H_%28TV_series%29
Big macintosh aproves Pokémons only.
Like I said never seen M*A*S*H :$
Oh yeah, he needs to earn 10000 funds before going home
god I hate pokemon :|
wow.... treasure = trash..
lol
U__U
Irish_Pony I mean the old ones >:<
On his planet, it's treasure. On earth, it's trash lol
>.<*
brb
going to play xbox for a while
Oh... This lol
I just want Justin Bebier to go into a coma already >_>
anyone want to join?
Yeah I guess Katy Perry does
If you don't like Pokémons anyways, your childhood must have been reaaaally bad.
if anyone has xbox live, fell free to add me - arand-mbum
Pokemon is awesome! I still play it up to this date
Irish_Pony yeah.... god i hate mainstream music these days
arand0mbum*
I HATE catching that Regice though. I've been at it for days :S
see yo uall in an hour or so.
well that looks like a pointless game :|
panda: even little talks by of monsters and men?
panda: I love the classics for 40's and 50's :)
Hello again, I see this guy is playing nights!
Irish_Pony i k r?
FalonSquirreltamer never heard of it ^-^
panda: try watching it with the video and dailymotion its awesome i think
or pikman,sorry about screwing that one up!
FalonSquirreltamer will do :)
pony_7825 I did fail when i was to chatch Palkia i used a normal pokeball and then i accidentally killed Palkia, that is why i ALWAYS save before meeting a leg pokemon, because you can just turn off if you fail and load the file that was save before the battle.
Okay, there's a song called MacArthur Park. It's well composed but the lyrics are rather melodramatic.
I know my grandpa has all of M*A*S*H on DVD but I haven't been getting along with my grandma that well lately :s
panda: tell me what you think when you did :3
Oh, and it's sung by RICHARD HARRIS.
TOO MANY WALLS!
^
MasterBoss43: Yep. It's a good thing saves get you back to the spot
Ye.

FalonSquirreltamer: Thanks, that was for derpy day

does it matter if anyone else thinks it's good? (which it is)
outside assumption
Om: really! Your actually really good!
kick its ass, SB!
I have a friend who sings country music and she can't stand listening to her own songs.
i can understand that
SB stream? awwwwyeeeee
You can think its good, but I'll never be convinced.
Err, she's actually good, ICEBERG.
Fudge........ SB64 is streaming?
if you've spent so long listening to the same thing over and over again, i wouldn't really be into listening to it after i'm done either
Om: Not even if I get you all over the brony community?
i never said it wasn't
http://www.creationtips.com/arksize.html
hmm
Oh, shouldn't have assumed
Assume = ass(u + me)
Om: In fact I was wondering if you could draw some art for my group :)
Irish_Pony: No, not even then. And you shouldn't, there are others who are better and have worked harder who deserve recognition

That is true
Sleep can give you nice dreams
Nittany_Discord: I never dream anymore :|
Dammit, Ctrl+Shift bugs me a lot.
11,01Ponies47: Ow.
I dream rarely, but when I do, it's either amazing, or a nightmare :S
I meant ^ in place of ?
11,02-.-
I forget really quickly, though, so I started writting my dreams in a notepad to keep in track of the good dreams
Nittany_Discord: That is why I hate sleep is boring and I don't dream so whats the piont? :(

Ponies47: Good to speak to you again and yeah i see :)
I don't know on a specific date, but I had a really weird dream. It was WoW related
What was funny, though, is that I was in one of my characters that I used to play as often
ADS|ded: Ok. I don't dream so I find sleep pointless. I haven't had a dream in years. :(

HiImSpike: Yeah. :P

Yeah, that was the first time I saw Toy Story 3. True story.
I know I'll be singing along with Hellfire tomorrow night X3
Everypony was so sad at the end of Toy Story 3 :"(
:'(
pony_7825: yeah. :(
It was sad, but I wasn't able to shed a tear.
It was pretty dark, but a satisfying ending
That has got to be my favorite song from ANY Disney movie...lol

Hey scottish-geeky :3
I don't cry much, but I do feel a heavy heart on those moments
I liked Toy Story 3. It was good sad ending. :(

DeathStar: go to sleep
NZ RULES!
xmasskills how the hell is that going to lull anyone to sleep?
DeathStar: not AUSTRALIA
xmasskills: ^^
I MEAN AUSTRALIA LOL
AUSTRALIA RULES NEWZEALAND DROOLLS
IDAS: you right not australia
IDAS: LIES AND SLANDER!
Stop, already! All this fighting, just end it! We're throwing people's life away! Even thouh every single solder has a famility waiting for them to return! We're making them look like idiots! Stop! <--- Those words from the song I linked before...
DeathStar: go to sleep sheep shagger
DeathStar: lol jks
:[

Scotland wins by a landslide as we have the most drunk and violent teenagers on earth. ^_^
seriously, what is up with the racism?
xmasskills: whats this country called New Zeland
Rain: its not racism
nationalism.
That video still gives me goosebumps. -_.
meh.
IDAS, you just called someone a sheep shagger. :|
00,02goddamnitunrealengine
Rain it's more nationalism
DeathStar: Agreed. And gnight
Rain: still not racism
Phase4: I KNOW RIGHT
/me 00,02hugs Rain
Phase4: I am using UDK myself, F*CKING PIECE OF CRAP UNSTABLE CRAP
xmasskills: Meanwhile is Australia http://assets.meanwhilein.org/hashed_silo_content/70d/f7b/049/resized/meanwhile-in-australia-ddea5e.jpg
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5YfYtZ32d4&feature=BFa&list=FLAViXIrbp86kg5lvVfFdQuQ <--- PONYTIME!
IDAS, how is that /not/ racist?
IDAS: shall we plan to raid new zeland
Phase4: says it to
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbKwIYgpzU <--- pony rock tyme!
xmasskills: DOWN WITH KIWI LAND!
00,02ok... i'm not using the udk, just want to make an unreal engine game go into windowed mode
IDAS: YEAAAA
00,02havent heard good things about the udk though
screw this, Im out
Well this conversation topic is boring.
Well i don't consider my nationality a race and the only reason we shag the sheep is because that's the only thing Australia won't resort to stealing
UDK is kinda clunky. I had to use it for a game dev coure I was just in. It should hopefully get better once Unreal Engine 4 is out.
00,02Vordox, you wouldnt happen to know how would you?
http://verydemotivational.memebase.com/2012/06/05/demotivational-posters-reassurance/
Phase4: Windowed mode?
00,02in a window, not fullscreen
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbKwIYgpzU <--- pony rock tyme! Also last thing I'm goign to do tonight.. so watch it!!!
You could play the engine with a play command, it should become windowed then
If you extract it into an exe, it'll probably go fullscreen
Mutterguy: NOW THATS RACIST
Phase4: Unless you changed something in options
Mutterguy: :D:D:D:D ahahaha
Oh wait, AN UNREAL Game..
As Oscar Wilde once said "Patriotism is the virtue of the viscious"
Phase4: -window?
Every day I'm partying!
00,02just trying that now
FairysHuff: so what if were viscious we are to blinded by patriotism to carwe
Phase4: Any luck?
xmasskills: http://i.imgur.com/dx6yR.jpg that pic prove why AUS is ossim

Bye MasterBoss43.
00,02BrOnyxia, i know
:)
XD
bey MasterBoss43
BrOnyxia: SOME of them?
FUN FACT HERE GUS
60 Kilo Safe + Kid on a trampoline = Too heavy, A kid STANDING on the safe THEN on a trampoline = Change of mass.
diddutz: except the free steam games for ati and nvidia cards
MY HEAD IS TOO LOGOCAL FOR THIS
Vordox: it looks like he turns that nice and heavy safe into styrofoam
BrOnyxia: okay, that might be legit
Dark_Horst: But the kid is a constant
diddutz: :3
that kind of fucks it, indeed
11.•10«11WB10 (Lighty10) 11WB10»11•. 10- i sooo love e-mail, i win atleast 5 cars everyday
Vordox: yeah, i noticed that, too
Dark_Horst: Thank you, if SCIENCE, THINK SCIENCE; not THINK SCIENCE but stop gibberishing :P
maybe it'S MAGIC styrofoam
Dark_Horst: There IS an explanation to it
Mystery solved => ITS MAGIC!
Dark_Horst: His SELF is the same,but his mass changes...but why MUST he stand on items to changemass instead of standing alone?
URGh
Erryday ahm shovelin
LOL
THESE REFERENCES ARE TOO BLUNT
Vordox: but that's how we like em
oh god lol
You'll get a blunt smack to the face and you'll like it.
Hai Ike
Meanwhile: NEVAH unless it's erotical nature :P
Pfft
So basically this game is about shapes and bouncing :P
Irish_Pony: Science but not science
00,02you see
00,02this here
00,02is why portal worked soo well at valve
:D
Phase4: Too easy?
its about gravity generally i guess
00,02too fiddly
00,02its easy to figure
I can tell :D
00,02hard to execute
00,02the figuring part is fun
Phase4: We're about 25 seconds behind
00,02THAT is what people enjoy
now imagine how this game woud look like if it had portals too
00,02dats a bit of lag
00,02Dark_Horst, brains might explode
Phase4: ya..."people" :P
its sort of like portal but with more garvity
Phase4: Heard of Crayon Physics deluxe?
00,02the other problem is some of these platforms are a little fidgity
and without portals
Dark_Horst: Dimension s.P
multiverse
Cave Johnston would be very dissapoint with this lab :/
00,02i have now
00,02dis game needs a little polish
Crayon Physics deluxe. <3 So fun and easy, except...err...yeah :P
btw, this you should see
http://9gag.com/gag/3013872
00,02portal was actualy quite a large change to the source engin
00,02engine'
00,02to suport the portals
must've been hell on his CPU
Phase4: Indeed, it was a fun change of pace. :P
00,02this is unmodified unreal engine, which is primaraly an fps engine
but ti was more about the personas then the easy puzzles(Imo)
Phase4: they created lots of new ents with portal 2 release
00,02new tools too
yar
LAWL
00,02and irational spaces posible
DAT PORTAL IMAGE
00,02i'ma stop after getting this reactor going
00,02want to eat, and dont want to spoil the entire thing
Phase4: Try out Crayon Physics deluxe. :P It's a very slow pace physics game
You need to get it though through...some measures.
yeah those world portals can make level design very fun ^^
those divide by zzero jokes
Phase4: The vats NEED TO be fluffy?
off for lunch back soon
00,02everything needs to be fluffy
aw so close
You need to make it heavy in mid air?
00,02OK
00,02in the top
00,02invisible walls on the sides
-_-
2 more :P
wow stream is behind
Stream is always behind.,
oh, this one's going to be a bitch
Phase4: Feck up the game, bu placing safe AND vat on same bounce = P
aaaand slamdunk
i know but .. well.. doesnt matter anyway
Toilet Flush...really?
Im wondering should I or should I not buy Garrys Mod :S
yeah let's try to ninja that game!
00,02Vordox, soo should have tried that
Phase4: Hehe <--- Game Designer, while other see game, I see codes. :P
what the hell?
Vordox: ;o?
00,02XD
BrOnyxia: While other see the game, I see the code, since I used these Game Motors everyone is using nowadays.
what was the point of that?! XD
you dedded
Vordox: programming? like cpp?
or java coz i know some shitz
BrOnyxia: No, scripting. :P
aw so close

Vordox: you mean centripetal force?
shana: No, Centrifugal, you know. LIKE A WASHING machine
Vordox: well, when they're white, they stick to the platforms.... guess the safe jsut didn feel like physics today
Dark_Horst: THANK you
Vordox: there are too many sciences for the developpers
Vordox: there is no such thing http://xkcd.com/123/ :)
Hello!

You MAKE the problem work.
and time togo to sleep
Yay scored ace at oral english exams today :)
Isn't making a problem work technically a solution?
morning, everypony! :) *yawns* how are we all this morning?
Nice one killerpony7733.
Allo Sylandest.
Congrats killerpony7733
g'nite my nooby pony friends! :D
Sylandest: i'm so hyped for getting the highest i could i oral english
Night Prick.
good afternoon Sylandest
in*
/me hugs Meanwhile, killerpony7733, and FalonSquirreltamer
killerpony7733: I'm sure you'll do well :)
Sylandest: Correction DID
killerpony7733: ahhh i see. Congrats then! :D hehe
Sylandest: i said i scored the highest you can get :P
killerpony7733: right, right...forgive me, i woke up about 10 minutes ago, lol :$
Sylandest: It's ok :D
Wow. I totally misinterpreted that image. I thought it was Fluttershy sleeping while crushing what looks like another her in a dress. That's just Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle while Scootaloo is on top of her.
=-9\
*=_(\
:P
Wut
Eh?
nani?
Pie?
Por quoi
XD
Hey everypony
Me jelly
?
hi DarkStar
hello everypony :)
99999999999999
ohia
morning, Dark_Horst, and oni_link! :)
sup
Hey oni_link
How are you Sylandest and DarkStar?
oni_link: I'm doing well, hehe. I'm currently nomming breakfast before work. How about you?
Im good, playing some Reach
"A girl goes into the past and kills her Grandmother. Since her Grandmother is dead, the girl was never born. If she were never born, she never killed her grandmother." dat logic
Sylandest: Breakfast eh, what are you having?
DarkStar: Ooh Reach, I love that game :)
oni_link: poptarts, banana, and milk :3
Halo FTFW!
Halo 4 =_=
oh and btw theres gonna be ANOTHER Gears of War
Irish_Pony: aye, i heard about that
I cant wait for Halo 4, its gonna be EPIC!!!!
Sylandest: Sounds pretty good :) I just came back from having an early breakfast with some of my friends out in a diner. I had pancakes with bluberry syrup!
oni_link: lucky! I didn't have time to fix more for breakfast...:D
DarkStar: I know, I was like shut up and take my money Microsoft!!
the stream lives
Halo. Meh.
Sylandest: Well at least what you did prepare is tasty! I'm stuffed :P
oni_link whats ur gamer tag?
oni_link: hehehe, its enough for now, i suppose
00,02stream working?
Phase4: aye!
Phase4: yes
It's good so far
DarkStar:xoRETRIBUTIONox
Ill add ya
Hmm, right after I said that, I got a buffer circle
Sylandest: Then you should have an even better lunch!!
Phase4 stream time whoo!!
oni_link: I hope to, lol. It depends on how work goes and what I'm hungry for :D
00,02one of the 4x crates is worth a lot
00,02anyone know which?
Sylandest: Haha well lets hope you're extra productive today then :)
there is a page on the tf2 wiki telling you how are the chances of getting ehich item, for each crate series, they might say something
DarkStar: sweet my xbox is in the other room though :D
Oh, Ill still add you though
oni_link: I usually am, lol. The only thing with it is that its a long shift. I usually finish my tasks within the first few hours
I never did get how this website worked :S
DarkStar: what other games do you have? and awesome, I need more XBL brony buds!
Sylandest: Ah, and then you're just trying to look busy the rest of the day huh?
oni_link: kinda sorta, ehehe. Helping to run a trade shop means the day depends on what folk bring in to trade or sell. I am sincerely hoping for an easy day
Ive got a larrge veriety of games oni_link
Sylandest: I bet you meet all sorts of people though. Im usually stuck in a warehouse all day and I finish shipping off online orders in a matter of hours. Then I spend the rest of the work day playing NES games at my work station :D
well screw it Im gonna go play TF2
DarkStar: Well do you have MW3 and Future Soldier?
oni_link: I is so jelly...:D. The folk I meet aren't always pleasant. Many of them are folk who are looking for nothing more than a quick buck for gas or something. And even then, I can't take half of what they trade in
so did phase4 finish that game
is the chat dead
00,02i'm not doing so well
00,02alexxm, nope
thanks Phase4
we're all just sorta chillin...XD
good good
Phase4: that pyro is sure causing trouble for you, lol
kill the pyro
Sylandest: Ouch but the problem with my job is that its all based orders. If there aren't any orders then usually that means there isn't work for me for the rest of that week. And also I get paid by the ammount of orderes shipped . Like this week I only worked Monday through Wednesday. :(
00,02ragequit that server
LOL
4hey
Phase4: Rage quittting like a bawss
I play the poorman's TF2 on XBL cause I'm PC less...
oni_link: ahhh, I see. That is a bit of a troublesome job. Mine's a pay by the hour job, usually in 8 hour shifts. Its good money for now, since most of what I earn goes towards college
oni_link i'm sure you'll get more work soon
Mornin everypony ^-^
morning, BroKnee!
alexxm: thanks and I hope I do. I really wanna just find a better job. So far no luck.
night all :D :P
night, IDAS
hey BroKnee what have you been up to
Night IDAS
bye IDAS
oni_link: what sorta job would you want to have?
Sylandest: I gotta go back to college :P
BroKnee: nice name lol
alexxm Sleep xD
IDAS Ty :3
Sylandest: I'm not really picky, as long as I get paid weekly and by the hour. I'll take what I can get :D
why not have a army of havies with one medic between them
oni_link: I still got 2 more years to go through before I'm done, lol. And thats a good mentality for work
alexxm: because the heavies can usually be outgunned or outmanuvered by soldiers or scouts, let alone engineer turrets
good point Sylandest
Sylandest: Awesome, what's your major?
oni_link: English major, focus in literature, with a minor in Sociology
Sylandest: Ah, so you plan on teaching?
oni_link: pfffft, I would make a bad teacher...:D. No, I seek to be a writer/author. I love to write stories, so its what I want to do more than anything
Sylandest: Wow, thats great :) I love kids but I don't think I can handle teaching em either :D
I feel young now O.o
BroKnee: why?
killerpony7733 They are talking about college and I'm 14 xD
oni_link: my brother intended to go into teaching and even managed to get his teaching degree. He came home a couple weeks ago and said "I do not want to teach anymore". I guess the kids he had to work with to get his degree broke him
BroKnee: I'm not old...I'm only 20...T.T
BroKnee: Ah i see i'm 17 and only less then 2 months till i turn 18
I still feel young now xD
Sylandest: I'm 20 too :D
oni_link: 20 yr olds ftw! /) :D
Broknee: Enjoy that feel while you can!
Sylandest: (\ right back at ya! :D
whats so awesome about beeing 20?^^ in amerika its like beeing 15 in germany :P
dat random music...
oni_link I don't like being young :p
FalonSquirreltamer: its the age thats right before you turn 21! :D
i'm 18
me too
FalonSquirreltamer: I want to be you right now :o Germany and Japan are my two favorite places
BroKnee: it is, I count down the days til I'm 21
sure i can drive smoke and drink but i cant see most videos on youtube^^
BroKnee: yeah, it usually is, lol. It grants full legal adulthood.
oni_link I'm going to Tokyo with a groupof friends when I'm 18
oni_link Sylandest xD Wowzerz
Well, I'mah get on TF2 now
BroKnee: have fun :)
enjoy yourself BroKnee
FalonSquirreltamer: really? :D
oni_link: yeah and all games are censored
i wonder how many people have started playing tf2 just because they saw it here ...
when i turned 18 me and a friend went to tennireffe and went clubbing for a week
diddutz: plenty, im sure, lol
FalonSquirreltamer: Yikes, I always used to lie when I made profiles for websites :D
me too but still^^ like in l4d when i kill someone they just fade
killing tons of undead.. aaaand they are gone^^
OMIGOSHOMIGOSHOMIGOSH GUESS WHAT!
FalonSquirreltamer: is that an age restriction thing or is it like a parental setting?
FalonSquirreltamer: i meant age restriction or region restriction
oni_link: ist just the german version
dr-whooves: what?
dr-whooves: whaaatt??? D:
what happened dr-whooves
I got my Dota2 beta key /)^3^(\
gratz, dr-whooves
I've been waiting for 2 months
FalonSquirreltamer: awesome!
good to hear dr-whooves hope you enjoy it
alright, everypony, i gotta head out to work now. I'll catch you all laters
bye Sylandest
Sylandest: Be sure to have a nice lunch on your break!
oni_link: just a stupid thing when you buy them on steam
oni_link: I will try :D
Sylandest: alright then, take care!
FalonSquirreltamer: I wish region coding and altering didn't exist :(
Hello Everyone
oni_link: yeah its stupid but the beer at age of 16 erases the disadvantage i think^^
hey Ninjazz hows your day been

FalonSquirreltamer: Yeah, makes getting plastered on a weekend much easier for you all over there. Us under 21 have to find people to buy it for us :D

alexxm: Why is that? :(
08,01hullo all
FalonSquirreltamer: you find people. They scratch your back, you give em a few bucks or a beer or two. You also meet new people that way. Last time there was this girl I went to an event with and she took me to a party after and bought me beer :D
Ninjazz bus strike which means i couldn't get into college i could only get half way there as that was the only bus working so i pretty much wasted most of the morning

LightTrooper105: oh i guess i didnt catch that :P thats good then

alexxm: I might have to drop out from university :S but I could settle for a modest job as well.

Weapons trading is a nasty bussiness in TF2 but not as hard ast trading unusuals...
alexxm: I'm stuck and can't pass exams :D
Thank god summer vacation starts for me tomorrow

alexxm: thats soo awesome /)^3^(\
Lol
00,02seems the tf2 warehouse only works in the steam overlay
00,02which is anoying
that is pretty annoying Phase4
Sup.
hey OverGrownPegasus10 hows your day been
Phase4: I never really understood how it worked, Im not even sure what the hell the dudes buying :P
Good, been a while since I last came here.
/me 00,02hugs OverGrownPegasus10
Even since:'( THE LAST EPISODE OF SEASON 2!
jesus man
*hugs Phase back*
And I also got a Derpy shirt and a brony bracelet from hot topic.
OvergrownPegasus10: I barely made it to see the finale on the stream :(
Me too, I had to watch it on youtube.
Still worth the wait.
wut is dis
Phase4: Get Crayon Deluxe :P
dafuq
OverGrownPegasus10: you know my feel
Morning everypony! ^.^
I know dat feel bro.
Hello Everypony!<3
good afternoon Crono
and Pegasister ^^
OvergrownPegasus10: /)
hello Crono_brony and Pegasister
00,02i have very little to do
hey Crono_brony and Pegasister how have your days been
alexxm: I've been doing great! Thanks for asking! ^^
Phase4: Javascript for pros? I am intrigued
00,02oni_link, http://weepy.github.com/kaffeine/
00,02looks usefull
Phase4: y u no play
He has ze things to do
I had a neat little streak going there.
Although I kept mistaking Pinkie's sound effects for my chat ping.
XD
YAY!
this game looks intreasting
This reminds me of another game
Phase4: Good luck Phase. THINK SCIENCE AND PHYSICS
Is Pincess Luna here?
Draw stuff....seems legit
Remember, Mass, Gravity, Centrifucal, Pedal, ALL of it
sort of like that ds game with the words expect with pictures
DRAW DERPY!
alexxm: scribblenauts?
yeah oni_link
alexxm: Crayon Physics Deluxe.
:P
Seriously, this game is way too familar
alexxm: Oh wait, yeah derp on me, my bad.^^
Even the music
I think played some of this once.
I got bored pretty fast.
It starts easy...
VERY easy but once you get to the pedalian science...Oh god
i still need to play scribblenauts
Scribblenauts sounds fun
Lawl Phase XD
this also reminds me a bit of Kirby's Canvas Curse
Scribblenauts, also very boring very fast.
Cheating Pusher Phase4 XD
00,02XD
oni_link: Kirby Canvas. <3
Brb guys
I need to find what this reminds me of
yeah i mean when you have pretty much every word in the english langauge you can't really think of what to do with it Meanwhile
Vordox: again, another game i need to play , i tried it out , loved it and never played it again . i need that game now
Oh yeah this game
oni_link: The one where you draw with your text that creates an item of that name?
alexxm: That and being able to do that gets dull very quick.
Remember, Phase4 ...Mass.
Vordox: yeah but nah, I want the Kirby game more now that i remebered it :D
Kirby<3
oni_link: Hehe. :P Played that and 100%, fun game
o shit
Super easy first island, after that, once the rockets get into play.. :P
my bed started shaling
shaking*
LOL
:O what game is this?
Science in your FACE Phase4 XD
Vordox: rockets? this game needs my money
Derp
oni_link: Just wait
Dat push
00,02xD
Phase4: Smart, you can "hook" stuff to keep them placed in place. Think of like how you put a storage cart after your car, the "hook" like that
Phase4: why you no create ramp, then object to move circle to ramp??
Pffft.
Haha Phase4 XD
http://www.coolmath-games.com/0-magic-pen-2/index.html
This is what this game reminds me of
SO MUCH
Phase4: Make things rounded, a circle with an end. Like 0 to make it into a mass
Magic Pen is exactly like this
YAY
Or 8, or 6, etc etc, just make sure they are closed to give them mass, and that mass helps against gravity alot
Leverage TIME!
Okay now I'm satisfied that I know what it reminds me of
Phase4: Draw a BIG object in the air with a mass onto the leverage
But this one seems better
Such a simple game :)
not enoughleverage
MadSurge: Life is simpler then you think :P
What is this game called anyway?
OverGrownPegasus10: Crayon Physics Deluxe
Hello my sujects
FFFFF-
Vordox: I already think life is simple :)
hey Mistress_Molestia hows your day been
Phase4: Make it "Closed" Space, like an 0 or 6, to give them HUGE mass.
Hi Mistress_Molestia
hi mistress :)
Phase4: Lines = Small Mass, Circles, or closed = Huge mass
LOL
00,02k
Interesting WAY of solving it Phase4 XD
Its early alexxm not much has happened
00,02Vordox, worked didnt it
Now heres the question, which came out first? Magic Pen or Color Physics?
Phase4: True, there IS no true solution, you can solve it HWOEVER you want
Mistress_Molestia: your highness
Excuse me Mistress, do you know where your sister Luna is?
I MUST PLAY THIS
DarkStar, Im not sure.
NOW
hammer
NOW THE FUN BEGINS!
Is Mistress_Molestia really a mistress? :D
HAZZAH! THE FUN HAS BEEN TRIPLED!
I'd rather leave that question unanswered MadSurge.
looks more like an axe to me
Science the vidya game!!
Yes I am
Meanwhile: :D Hiiii
oni_link, Portal is science the video game. Ask science woona.
Tax[M] what does the M mean?
This is, *makes rainbow with hands* IMAGGGGINATIOOON
DarkStar: It means I'm property of Mistress_Molestia.
hello peoples :D
Wha?
Well that answers that then. >_>
It means he's infectied with monkies
hey rocketbrony hows your day been
hello rocketbrony
May I ask how you got that?
Tac[M] what
i just woke up XD
Phase4: Push is for casuals. ;)
Bridge time!
Pffffft.
Silly filly, that wasn't a bridge
i'v seen this game somewhere...what was it
That was a GIANT HAMMMMMER
The blue dots makes ANYTHING that's connected to them swingable OR MAKE them stale, like 2 dots = Unmovable objects.
well that was a success
I would have made a slope
rocketbrony Magic Pen?
THere we go!
SCIEEENCE
It's exactly like this
oh yeah! thats it!
its been 2 years since i played that..
Science is best idea
dat butter knife
QUICK, DRAW A BUTTERFLY
Science Woona approves :D
Phase4 takes the easy way. XD
00,02i think i broke it
Lol
LOL its stuck in there
Vordox: why not
Yep, its broken :D
nvm XD
Wow.
O.O
He broke the science
whoever is playing this. they are failing.
so how did that happen
Phase is
The answer is to draw stuff.
xD
LOL
xD
What is that? A fortune cookie?
i think he's just winging it here....lol
the science it does nothing
really Phase4?? :p
XD
OverGrownPegasus10: Don't ask...noone knows XD
LOL
XXXXXXXDDDDDDDDD
RAAINBOWWW
CASUAL EASY MODE ACTIVATED
alexxm: nothing!!!
LOL
soo many pretty colors :D
Dashie would be prud
nailed it
i'm guessing a stream is on?
HOW DID THAT WORK :D
nice
its about time he finished that XD
Chrono: YOU DON'T SAY
Crono_brony: yeah
:D
yep Crono_brony can you see it
Use mass to solve this Phase4 .^^
DAMN YOU MIPS.TV!
It's a wrenchQ
it never works for me.
Crono_brony: if you don't see it try refreshing the stream <:3
Oi! Whats with this TLC shit im hearing about?!
Dafuck are you doing?
Smart phase. :D
lol
xD
Ohhh
I don't get it
00,02well thats done
oh. this is a demo.
DEMO IS OVER :(
Phase4: Thought you had the full game. :D

aw lame :(
aw
aw :(
*crys*
MadSurge: I have been!
PLAY MORE MAGIC PEN THINGY!
:(
MAGIC PEN!
Play the flash version!
Phase4: What you think? And you didn't get to the rockets, Centrifugal, Pedalian, OR the Draw your own points.^^

00,02Irish_Pony, the thinking derpy, yeah
Hello everypony!
I'm back
00,02ohai Dark92Enigma and OverGrownPegasus10
hey Dark92Enigma hows your day been
Phase4: I dont blame you, it happens to me but with the TV remote :D
00,02oni_link, i solved that
00,02simply dont watch tv :P
alexxm i couldn't be more excited, because The Hunchback of Notre Dame will premiere right here on bronystate!!!!!!!!!
i love that movie :)
Phase4: well with a lack of the Hub network now and the only channels I watch being Adult Swim and Comedy Central, I don't watch much anymore anyhow.
surf map?
lol
00,02oni_link, the only show i care to watch is star trek
00,02which is thursday and saturday i think
00,02three eps of next gen on thur, 3 of voyager on sat
Phase4: so you don't watch ponies?
00,02they dont show ponies here
00,02:(
00,02well they do, on foxtel
00,02but foxtel is crap
Phase4: nice. It's not my thing but I respect Star Trek for lasting as long as it has.
oi Phase4 accept the friend request so i can give you your gift :)
00,02oni_link, its a very unique series
I remember a time playing TF2 where we made a stalemate. It ended up in a dancing contest between engineers :D
lol I just slept :3
00,02theres no other real speculative sci-fi show
do you think Friendship is Magic will still have fans long after it ends?
Phase4: I shall give it a go. Which series should I start with?
I like Voyager,.
CCCP: most likely
CCCP: I would hope so.
CCCP probably depends on g5, but I think g4 will be around for a long time.
CCCP: don't make me think about... THE END.
00,02oni_link, either next gen or voyager tbh, the original series is very much a product of its time
CCCP: I think so :3 friendship never ends!
:3
/me 00,02hasnt seen that much of the original series
As long as the community keeps loving it, then we will see it being loved for years
why do pyros troll so much -.-
And oc
Phase4: so, Picard fan? :)
Phase4: Will do, thanks
/me is about to do a reading of chapter 1 of Silent Ponyville 2
00,02MadSurge, i'd say so
ive already done a reading for the whole of the first one :p
Phase4: sent you your gift :)
These custom maps are so trippy
XAX: oh yeah, kudos for that. I remember you sent me the links for the first oen

OtakuTom: Ever heard of surf maps?
no
/me has only ever played 5 minutes of TF2
Ah.
Well...
OtakuTom: with the momentum they use from the initial fall, they used the floor to "surf" from platform to platform in an attemp to reach the end.
http://fav.me/d50gs3p + http://telusplanet.net/public/dctiegs/2003/image/IrRC-tunic = How sexy?
Actually surf maps are hard to explain. Just slide.
Ninjazz: i think i did :D
You explained "how". :P
Do want.
Not what is the point.
Flutacreep?
Ninjazz: Slide around in chat, I see.:D

Well hey at she's "hotter" than ever ;)

Irish_Pony hey i already have you watched :), i just didn't know you were "Monopoly907" XD
Lil_B: :P
Ninjazz: i sympathize :( thats horrible
oni_link: It is... imagine... No! Don't even try. It's horrible. :c

Ninjazz: You just reminded me of a little refrence I made on this game :D
Ninjazz: D: *hugs*
Arrow to the knee?
Ninjazz: I was there at one point , I know that feel bro /)

Stab. Stab. Stab.

I used to make Arrow to the knee jokes, but I still do.

Ninjazz: Indeed.

/me I used to wonder what insomnia could be, till you all told me to go to sleep:|
LoyalDash: They were never good to begin with. People make them just to be annoying anyway. :P
I used to wonder what pocket lint could be.
Spectrum_Rush: :D
Spectrum_Rush: lol
Ninjazz: That is why I'll probably never even play Skyrim. The internet reduced it, snooped it to that degrading level.
whats with the slides in this map
LoyalDash if i had a good MIDI of the MLP Theme, i would try to make an orchestrated version :)
brb
Lil_B: Make all versions, now, fund that.:D
alexxm: these too, are surf maps

LoyalDash: It's not that bad... I mean the joke was just... a side effect. Once you mod the game, then it becomes pretty good.
XD
LoyalDash MLP Variations: The Album

Ninjazz: It is actually not even my type of game for me.>_<
Lil_B: Go to Aviators for that kind of stuff.:D

And hello Michael.
hi Michael and otakon17 ;)
hai Ninjazz and otakon17
FairysHuff: I love rain
oni_link: As do I. It needs to rain more.
incoming lag for me (opened 3 downloads imultaniously"
alexxm: The 17 means I've gone mobile and can't watch stream bc NO ONE MADE FLASH ON MOBILE for some odd reason...
odd
FairysHuff: over on my end of the world its dry and hot , i dont like it :|
Hi bronystate.
otakon17: Then you should get an ASUS Transformer Prime TF201 like me. Works with everything.
11,01Hi FillyFlam
hai FillyFlam
FairysHuff: No money
okay, time for bed. I'll see you all later.
hi FillyFlam
oni_link: Ick. I hate heat. ~_~ I die at 15 degrees C
So, otakon, how did it go with your mother? Are you still required to take down your PC?
otakon17: or wait until HTML5 fully replaces flash
Night OtakuTom sleep well
good night otaku... to late :(
I is gonna take shower brb
oni_link hopefully that happens within the next 2 years :/
oni_link: I hate HTML5, doesn't work right
FairysHuff: Imagine temp at 32 degrees c daily and i do too...
13Good afternoon, ladies~ ;3
otakon17: well it is fairly new. give it time. flash was far from perfect at first and still is
oni_link: I try not to imagine it. I'd have to have a bed on standby at the local hospital if it was that hot
Yh
Dat landing.
dat surf
Pizza should be ready now. I actually remembered to watch the time this time ^_^ Back in a bit.
dat derelle
FairysHuff: Yikes, never thought I'd see somone dislike it as much as me :D and cool
/me 11,01dusts FairysHuff with fairy dust.
otakon17 HTML5 isn't finished yet, and a lot of browsers only have it parcially build in, so there are lots of problems that will resolve over time
Okay then, bbl for the movies at least
Take care all!
Cya, otakon17! Take care.
Lil_B: just like flash at first. I believe shockwave was the predecessor right?
bye otakon17
Dat music, so fitting.:D
Bye otakon17.:3
Wrek: Ya here man?
bye otakon17
...There's music playing on my desktop for literally no reason.
Dat Twilight.
lol
dat spray
oni_link i think shokwave was something sligly different, but i could be mistake, I never really had something to do with it
Twilight? The center fold? Seems legit
Lil_B: cant wait for flash to be discontinued either way
Dat Demospam.
troll demoman
Wow, that is a bit cheap....
lol
Are you bucking serious...:D
00,02i'ma play normal tf2 on a local server

No more surfing for you Phase.

I never thought the L4D series would be good. GOD HOW I WAS WRONG!
You never thought L4D would be good? What kind of cavedweller are you.
why did you think it would be bad TheRandomkid321
It's Valve.
Meanwhile I took advice from my cousin
Never seen L4D :$
They're like Pixar or Lauren Faust. Goodness is a given.
FillyFlam: valve is far superior to every other game company
Now ya'll are gonna kill me aren't you :(
lolno
yay :)
FillyFlam i didn't really like the cars films
sup yall sorry i wasn't repawning
*YAWN* Soooooo tired... Finished me pizza. Nap is looking good about now.
Cars was ok
Unfortunatly australia gets the censored version. And now taht we are getting 18+ games I't wont be consored but I wouldnt be able to play ( I am 13 and haveno problem with MA stuff as long as it aint in oublic but R18+ Is too mcuh for me and I would never watch it even with permission)
alexxm: True, but they're still far better than a lot of other things out there.
Australia censors pretty much everything.
true FillyFlam
Well I've finally finish reading to fix you/what if? and I have to say. Good gracious
Censor ALL the things¬
Do ya think motal kombat will be around for another 5 years?
/me censors Meanwhile s moustache
TheRandomkid321, probably as a cash cow yes
/me 's moustache censors censors.
10Fox
Meanwhile: How does that even work?
11,01Australia is getting an uncensored version of L4D2?
Meanwhile: :(.
Nittany_Discord: hooooowaaaaaaaat?
Malavolent: Who knows.
Everlasting_Joy: Whatchu frowning at?
Meanwhile: ***** *** ****
11,01They got their R18+ finally.
Nitanny_Discord Not that I knwo of. But if they amke another L4D It will be R and not censored.... Wait
Meanwhile: About the Censor all the things. The text chat was scrolled up a bit, and by the time I realized it, I had already sent the frowny face.
_
I hope Motal Kombat will be around in 4.5 years (when I am 18) I WANT TO PLY IT SO BADLY!
Everlasting_Joy: Well I think censors should just **** ****** ****** with a wombat ****** ***** tomato soup **** ***** **** ******** ****** Abe lincolns great aunt.
Meanwhile: I agree.
Meanwhile: :D
Meanwhile: indubitably
Meanwhile Eeyup
As do I with Malavolent.
TheRandomkid321 its been around for about 20 years now i'm sure it'll be around in 5 years
Meanwhile: Too right
Meanwhile: :d
Lincoln did have a great aunt.
alexxm yeah. and it still has a great fanbase. Unlike COD nowadays. It will be fine and before long I will be ripping of heads of females with about as much clothes as a baby has hair.
TheRandomkid321: :D
TheRandomkid321: i hate CoD
TheRandomkid321: Lol :D
TheRandomkid321: more than the doctor hates pears

TheRandomkid321 i mean it was like the only midway franchise to actually survive midway going under
sup ponies47
Bronysith: i thought he hated apples:S
Nothing much :P
Bronysith: Ya know, you could give John Smith a pear, have him eat it, then laugh knowing in a few months, he'll not know of it, and we can just laugh.

Hey Bronysith, who's your favorite Doctor anyway?
Everlasting_Joy: hmmmm

Meanwhile is always mean, we just prefer him this way.

00,03anyways, brb~
Ninjazz: Okay, fine. I'd rather hear it from the horse's mouth, so to speak.
That reminds me...how the heck did "don't look a gift horse in the mouth" come about?
11,01It would be awesome if we got a donor that would bring us to our goal.

Nittany_Discord: Are you talking about Brony Funds?
11,01Yes.
Nittany_Discord that would still help the people who needed
Nittany_Discord: Wish I could, if only it was not for Paypal only
WindWhistler: A gift horse was a free horse given by someone to another. To look a horse in the mouth is to inspect it. Basically, don't be critical of things you're getting for free.
i donated 100 Nittany_Discord
Om: I like horses.
sorry that i cant donate more Nittany_Discord though
11,01You can use a credit card Vordox
You can?
Show me the link
11,01It's OK.
Ninjazz: I never would have thought, learn something new everyday.
GilDash: Okay, then. What can this pony tell you?
GilDash: Oooh, that makes sense.
GilDash: so what do you do when someone hands you a lit stick of dynamite?
11,01Paypal lets you pay with normal credit cards.
<@ScootaBed> Streaming while a Thunderstorm is going on? What could happen? Scoot-Scootaloo, the 4th wall could break and Twi could faint because human technology.
11,01You don't need an account or funds.

CountDoofus: kiss your plot goodbye
Om: I was refering to Elis.
CountDoofus: Drop it and run. :D
Ninjazz: That's entirely up to you. ;)
Does blowing a kiss count? I'm not that flexible.
GilDash: That's why I'm asking you to specify. ^-^
Ninjazz: And I wasn't.
Nittany_Discord: Link me the fundraiser
Where'd Scoots go?

WHO HERE IS GOOD AT MATH?
But it will be hosted over on Bronyfunds.
Like VERY serious Spatial Math
DashWithRainbows oh, thanks :)
/me has loinked more shit now than ever before
Vordox depends, what do you wanna know?
Vordox: im good at scientific equations but i suck at basic math :D
dat loink
*link
Scoot-Scootaloo: you sound confused :D
Vordox: Not even a little, but I can probably come up with a good enough word to describe it.
whats loink
/me brushies Scoot-Scootaloo's mane
fun fact. Bronystate has improved my typing speed
hey, this dude, jogi löw? he needs a pony. you guys wouldnt how that could be achieved?
what is the problem Vordox ? math or algebra homework ? :)
Okay, shortly, There's 2 animations that I want to go together, one is a total of 20 Frames, The other one is at 20 Frames, and the 22 frames should be withn the FPS of 8, while the 20 Frame should be 24, how to mix these two together so that the 22 frames DOES NOT BECOME distorted. What's the math for this?
Ah sorry, 22 frames and 20 frames
hummmm....
/me is back (gone 00:15:29)
hey Gunthler|Away
vordox: It means my mind is fucked
XD
Okay, resaying it
Vordox wait.. so all the 20 in your questian are 22?
Pinkies4thWall|Xbox: My big aid to learning to type quickly, was when I had to type to chat during Counter-strike matches back in college.
Vordox: i have no idea sorry,but if you have problems on scientific equations just call me
hey fillys and gentlecolts im back :3
One frame animation with 22 Frames, the core one that is. The other is 20 Frames. the 20 Frames should be at 24 FPS, while the Core animation should be in 8 FPS, how to mix these together without f'cking up
the core animation
/me glomps thatguy
hi FalonSquirreltamer
Hello.
How many frames do I need for the core animation from switching the FPS from 8 to 24?
hi Ouroboros
This one is PROBABLY super easy...if I knew what the buck i was doing...
ordox: is that homework or something for work ?
Ouroboros: Is Blazblue the namesake of your nick?
sergio_scriptor: No, it's Animation
Pinkies4thWall|Xbox: BLAZBLUE! <3
Vordox sounds like something a good animater would figure out with some rule-of-thump in 10 seconds flat, but yeah
Afraid not Pinkies4thWall
Vordox: hobby then ?
Lil_B: 10 sec flat...okay, gonna test that
sergio_scriptor: Eeeyup
If you've seen the wrek animation, although sucky, was me. :p
Vordox: fun (or not so fun) fact: I only know that because my brother Blaz's
not me
HELLO EVERYBODY
hi Nabronyan
Pinkies4thWall|Xbox: . :( Why is everyone looking at the BIG SHINY OTHER CAPCOM FIGHTING game, but ignore the Games that ACTUALLY Works... :'(
Ohai Nabronyan!
Allo Nabronyan
Sorry guys, forgot to say bye
My hands hurt so bad
Bye otakon17.
Vordox I guess I could try to calculate something, but i have no knowledge about animations, so i would need at least 5 minutes of concentraited calculating to a) figure the formulars out and b) actually trying to get a solution XD
Oh nevermind, It's 4x22 fps + offshift of 24. :D
Solved it, nevermind
Also, firefox decided to pull an error on me again
Nabronyan: how so? :O
Vordox thats what i ment XD
>.>
Lil_B: Thanks. It worked with the 10 Sec Rule
I'll be back tonight, take care everyone!
Screw xbox live I am done with that crap.
I just deadlifted 100 pounds five times
HERE GUYS RANDOM ZOMBIE PONYCRAP!

My hands feel broke
/me waves goodbye to chat for now.
I mean...WRIGHTCRAP
bye otakon17
Vordox: because fighting is not my genre (other than SSBB, that's special. i grew up with it.) My genre is action flight sims, racing, and Borderlands (First person Role Playing Shooter)
bya otakon17
bye otakon17
Pinkies4thWall|Xbox: Such a taste.
/me hugs otakon17
Nabronyan: YEEEAAHHH! *flexes*

OBJE..I mean HOLD IT!
I DID A CRAP TON OF CARDIO EXCERSISES

Vordox: does you 360 it on the box, or play three stations?
rule 1 Nabronyan
I feel like a puddle of jelly right now
Pinkies4thWall|Xbox: I play PS3, for now
Vordox Objection overruled!
sounds fun Nabronyan
Lil_B: HOLD IT!
rule 1 : cardio Nabronyan
/me has only an Xbox 360

Vordox GUILTY!
OBJECTION
Lil_B: OBJECTION!

NewDCD: Mark
NewDCD: oh? Experimenting? :)

>:(
09,01seems MotW it is
CCCP: me too but at least i got confort on knowing that only more one week of highschool before summer breack :) then i can spend 24 hours on bronystate :)
Every time I hung out with my brother for the past 2 years
also, DCD, how is the new stick treating you?
I was forced to watch him play SF
sergio_scriptor: yay :D
Nearly everyday
sergio_scriptor: my summer vacation starts tommorrow
Nabronyan whats so bad about street fighter it pretty much invented mordern fighting games
ill reboot brb
It got old after the first week
killerpony7733: lucky you :)
Nabronyan, I sympathise. I had to watch my friends play shooters all the time.
NewDCD: Noone likes SF4 or SF3 =P
Or MvC3
I think I have to rework my version of This day aria with the "Less is more" methjod XD its way to massive and cluttered for a Chiptune XD
I dont like SF3, I dont mind 4 or Marvel.
The ONLY character i liked in that game was the italian with the claw gauntlet and a white mask
hi all
Nabronyan, Thats Vega, and he's a spaniard.
SF.. whats SF?
My nick is named after his move.

12hmm?
Dark_Horst, allegedly Spike.
although that isnt true...
im possibly the only one in here that wants to see a rule 34 brony channel :) i have such a sick mind
Dark_Horst there's Spike Tv, but I wouldn't reccomend
what do all of you guys think about cloppers this question is on my mind for a while
ponyclone2 out of sight, out of mind
ponyclone2: i im a clopper,nut i only clop to Twilight Sparkle
when is the reading?
ponyclone2 i don't bother them they don't bother me
you guys are aware that discussing such things as clopping is against the rules here?
rainbowjack i fought it started
I thinks scoots is setting up
i never read my little dashy
probaly will ever
alexxm: Indeeeeed mr alexxm and that's how the brony civil war was put on hiatus :) my side vs your side at last in peacve :)
Dark_Horst: Technically it's "no discussing explicit material" That question's provocative but not particularly risque on it's own
