KetaminaDianePie: because you cuddled with a 14 year old

best server ewer
it feels like my little pony is slowly taking over everything
it just might be me
It already has
indeed
^
think I stopped playing TF2 shortly after it became F2P
I've seen F1 videos with pony references in
no it hasn't
... got owned by them too much
F2P TF2 is easy
Becasue all the F2P are nubs and easy to kill
the place i live in is completley isolated from mlp, except for the mlp that comes on at 6:40 on tv3
odd
Lol, wrek's a dobbr
ofc you'd say that
hmmm
13you should be able to get in now wrek, midnight und mirrorimage are here
MLP's been dubbed in Dutch as well, but it sounds sooooo horrible
05not responding
Couldn't say it's better in Polish ver.
original language ftw
lol
i can bet it sounds HORRIBLE in estonian, every single dubbed cartoon does
05tried but its not responding :C
can we have some BG music?
thank you :P
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oV_11XGHoog MLP opening theme in Dutch. be afraid
I know its so BAD
they could have been better the voices
just heard the polish one. Applejack sounded like a heavy smoker
:D
I wonder why all forean names are in english
good evening ponyfolk
13keep trying wrek, midnight and mirror are here
ohai arrowtobroknee

mlp estonian version episode is ticket master http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FK_gAkZi1z4
opening theme in Norwegian sounds pretty good though
05CANT JOIN :c
Te only foreign dub I've heard is italian and french
I'm searching for Jazzy_Hooves ist this the right channel ? Oh, hi by the way
I'm norwegian and I haven't heard it o_O
Hello kieferle_
estonian opening theme... kinda weak (sorry)
LunarKing: they all sound the same and like children
yea
What the hay? Pinkie's ''Lots of fun'' in the opening has been translated to ''Charm of Magic''? :/
lol
hi arrowtobroknee
In PL version of course.
Liaek cabbag
as much as i saw in the comments they said that the voice actors were kids of some of our voice actors
dunno
i guess it's aimed towards kids cause they don't know about the fanbase yet
"They don't know about the fanbase yet" They don't know, DO THEY EVEN HAVE THE INTERNET!? The first bloody google thing you put in, expect a bloody pony
dunno, i guess that's just me, they might know
they might not
Sorry, I kinda spoke my mind there :o
for some reason the saying that our prime minister said about acta about them eating seeds and not the ones you plant in the ground thing popped into my head
yay, moar fanfiction
dunno
ooooh Adventure
opening theme in french pretty much the same as the polish one, Applejack = heavy smoker
twilight is made of magic, can she win, uhh i dunno maybe?
xD
http://gmc.yoyogames.com/index.php?showtopic=531088 Lawl
Now I found an older version of polish dub. which had almost exact translation. I'm impressed.
I only know a few people aware of bronies, and that was through the scripted as hell kids react video. I don't think many people outside NA know what bronies are.
NA?
Dead chat is dead
/me knows a ton of UK bronies, and respectfully disagrees
*crit rocket*
lol
thought you'd like to know
And then any message containing 'Matt Smith' was met with an auto-ignore by my client
good evening :)
XD
I love you dari
olololololol
ah, destruction & mayhem :) Just what I need right now
what does NA stand for?
kaay
SWEET chili sauce :D
Just had a fun chat with Kieferle_
I want to play!
Chat, y u ded?
no
we're watching the stream
I want to play though
watching people play games is pleasant
TF2 is a great spectator sport
the snow agains my window is being weird
oh wow, that song
'dat song
whats wrong with the snow?
It turns to ice once it has passed
is there a 13yr old on voice chat?
cool
ice = a bitch
I feel offended
it's snowing against the window and is making a weird sound
I know many a 13 year old with deepish voices
like wind howling in the crack around a window?
no
Fazana: i'm 14 and my voice is berely going thru puberty it squeaks and my friends laugh at me
like little particles bouncing off my window
0,5HELLO EVERYONE
I'm 15, mine isn't exactly deep, but it ain't high either. Nothing we can control
hi lc
Uh oh
dont know what that would sound like. Houston never gets snow
0,5No racism. >.>
Hello LC
hiya LordCelestia
Hai LC
freezing rain at the best of times
you live in Houston?
LordCelestia: who is being racist?
yep
I sense no racism in this chat,
well then, I'll be close to you in a few month. coming to Amarillo in May :)
Oh dear
pls no remind me of that song
I g2g everypony my inspiration knows no bounds it would seem
Nice! into anime convetions?
Pinkie pie is inspector
05MY FAIC
sometimes when i think that i came up with a clever joke i type and after i press enter i regret it :)
Yes, your faec
MY MOUTH IS BURNING
anime... not so much :p conventions, depends on what's for sale :)
oh god heartburn!
I don't usually go to conventions
The first thing that's even close to a convention is Silverstone for the Brtish Grand Prix this year
Which I'm going
I tend to attend for new figmas and art auctions. and for the after dark panels :)
Snipahpiss tends to make crits happen
ahh
the only convention in Belgium that's worthwhile is called F.A.C.T.S.
When someone is covered in it, minicrits occur
Which is 1.5x damage
who here has ever had chili cheese fries from chubby's?
im REALLY weird for a 16 year old
Don't worry
Most bronies are
no
Let me know if you have plans to vistit Houston, I'll be happy to give you a taste of true Texas B B Que
We're a strange bunch
i mean im weird PERIOD
Period? um...
if you're having periods, then you're a girl
first off, i don't like smoking and i despise drinking
no fazan
Ohhhh
<LunarKing> i mean im weird PERIOD <-- join the club
THAT period
.
Cypresswolf: Comicpalooza?
im not english either
Period =/ Full stop
oh amn they are soo good they are fries smothered in chees with halapenos slices on top my mouth waters just thinking about them.
yea
I know, just being silly
Let me look that up a moment
I like the pizzas from Papa Johns
by saying weird i also mean i like things that others don't
man now i'm hungry and theirs no chubby's in New Mexico
as in i LOVE red paprica
or i simply like it quite a lot
I'm a closet Brony, if my mates found out, I would be ruined :(
i found mlp showed my friend, now he's also a brony :D
same. It's better to be a secret
Fazana: why if they are your true friends that wouldn't matter to them.
my other friend doesn't speak english so i didn't even try to show it to him
but there's non-english eps
If you know people of this day and age, you wouldn't think that frankly
yea
May 25 and its local, if you're game, I'll make plans to go
he's actually one person i wouldn't show it
my friends and co-workers know I'm a brony. most of them laugh at it, yet tolerate as well
Spaey
I'm slowly educating a friend in memes. Eventually I'll show him ponies
so... bunch of closet bronies
am i the only one who actually like red papricca?
never tried it
Though
Fazana: everypony in my school knows and they don't care they even get me mlp things sometimes.
I have susptions
it sweet and juicy
like an apple
05love this server cause its brony friendly
I think one of my friends is a closet brony
I like apples
whys that?
Theres loads of brony servers for TF2
My coworkers know Im a brony, took me some 3 months to shut up about it during work hours :)
He makes references every now and then
I try not to :c
heh, rarity
I remember a science class
hmm., May 25th... my flight back home is on 27th from Amarillo. gonna see how far away those two cities are
try to catch him in the act of being a brony
He said, "Unicorns and pegasi"
laugh at him for a good minute and then tell him that you're also a brony, should make things fun
How long are you visiting?
17th till 27th
who's that girl i hear she sounds HOT.
That's not a girl.......
It's a tiddler
Fazana: are you sure
welp, gonna play TF2 on the server poniponiponi
No tbh, my hearing isn't so good
and Amarillo and Houston are a good 10 hours drive :p
Fazana: your trolling me right....RIGHT!!!
No, I'm pretty sure said person is a 10 year old boy
Lol
mario_pony: Owned. :P

Oh hey DWR~
why's that?
Hello Athena!

britian tried to be m'multicultural' and failed
Hey mario_pony~
It's just their culture is contanimating ours
I'm with you there Fazana...
IKR? Just got back from ASDA in search of pony. No results so spent cash on Rockstar, pancakes, ice cream, syrup and Monster

Every day I have to corect people for "Couch" "Movie"

The Halloween bullshit with dressing up and begging for food didn't happen here either. :/
Then suddenly, everywhere.
Hello!
hiya Polydunami
I like halloween
well we have to seperate "halloweens"
u jelly?!?!
Not for candy

but to pwn little kids who come to my house
Hello Polydunami
I have a super soaker, and remember, it's "Trick and treat"
I never liked halloween. Never went trick or treating
So I snipe them with watuh from top window
Not too much water though, cuz that would just make me a bastard
Wouldn't want to soak the tiddlers
This is an unusual time for me to come on bronystate, is it not?
just enough to wet them
Oh well
Unsual? I disagree
i
You can come anytime, anywhere

soo
bored?
bored
yay :)
So am I actually
You guys are keeping me away from suiciding forthe lols

i'm gonna go buy god of war 1&2 in a couple of hours
hey fazana where did you come up with tiddlers
it's an old word, right?
Tiddler = I forget which dialect it originated from, but it means little kids
It is also a type of fish
kay
Which are very small
/me glomps DashWithRainbows

We havent had one yet
but I wanna see fillyshy
Twilight knows
and Fluttershy did it before

Now your server is full it seems

n
is it hard to play TF2 with a touch pad?

Dashie_Dashie|bamman: that's what she said
Thank goodness
just thought it would be fun
xD
Oh
Did you play hangman with yourself?
05my valentines was quite nice
Flowers and candy and junk like that were lining the thing
And lose on purpose!? ^__^
StinkomanFan: that's quite depressing
anyway
05a carried a gal out of school all the way to the buss stop cause she twisted her ankle
Not really, all store bought
05in the typical cheesy hero way
Roses are red, violets are blue, I'm single, are any of you?
d'aawww
Lol Wrek
I got her a stained glass heart :)
Wrek is a baws like that
Home made
I am Scoota, almost 28 years now
That's funny and heartwarming at the same time
so what did you think of that picture ScootaChicken
ScootaChicken: I'm single and quite available ;)
alexxm: STOP MENTIONING IT ;___;
>Ignored for mod's story of being cooler than me
sorry
This is why I hated valentines
Polydunami: inb4 any possible relationship between us will be illegal due to my underaged'ness
Wish I was one of those poor gunned down saps in Chicago
I love podcasts
Valentines day at my school, or at least amongst my grade, is kind of a joke :p
I didn't mean YOU ScootaChicken
I was talking about irl
^__^
Valentines day in general is a joke, to me atleast.
We have a little game around school on Valentines day
Polydunami: I think the same thing will apply
All the girls wear hearts and have to ignore the boys
It's my lifes mission to find a pegasister to be my woman.
If they speak to them they lose 'em
Mostly because I'm 14.
so am i!
So, it's essentially men trying to flirt with women tenfold
/me zing
XDDDDD
Holy crap. I hear VOICES.
this podcast
dat WubWubCanary
NYEAH SEE?
suddenly WubWubCanary
Some years they have it reversed so the men are avoiding the ladies
c:
I am LOVING this picture so far
And erryone else~
what are the voices telling you to do WubWubCanary
Partly because Rarity
I once won by asking women out, once they yelled at me they lost it all
<3 Rarity
hey Wrek ?
The voices are telling me to be all mushy. And THIS DRAWING WREK.
Not too shabby CountDoofus.
05?
Carried a mini-Rarity around school today, because I wish she was my special somepony
oh finally i find the server but 12 vs 12 already uhmm
/me forever alone
00,10oh nice shadeing, and yay I think it will be red.
Wrek, it's looking so great TT_TT
That's not half bad
thats what she said! i was waiting soo long to say that!
Indeed it looks amazing~
StinkomanFan: Dont say that. There's someone for everypony.
it looks shmexy Wrek
just like you.
Oohoh.
inb4 I get ScootaRejected
/me wants to hug Rarity
all you focused on was my 'Forever alone' thing
Damn it all
Forever a pony
I'm going to go work on my fanfiction

And then Kammerjunk was the tick.

Someone xD
So be careful what you wish for.

It's because whenever I develop a crush on someone, I get cripplingly nervous

Hey ScootaChicken ^.^

Somehow, that nick reminds me of a Twilight Zone episode
hi KwakLad
00,10this flash is making me sad
mario_pony -_-
lol jk
My hair also looks really dark in photos when it isn't
did she kill spike?
But you know, you ant constantly look for love... the second you Actually stop looking, youll find it :P
*you cant
/me still misses Fluttershy` :'(
I'm not looking for love, to be honest
Happy Valentine's Day
00,03Bad...
00,10dis song.
Same
00,03Ass....
I've had way too many failures on that end to care
:(
What you need to do is buy a 'Free hugs' tshirt
Sure she'll be around (unless im missing something) OneTrickPony
Get all the ladies
Nice text, Wrek :D
trust me Mario you don't want me, I'm old fat and a crazy cat lady with bird nest hair. Not sexy. You can do better
and mario_pony is 14
Globetrotter: go play with your ladies ^__^
that too
What ladies?
00,03Thats what they all say!
KwakLad: you're not missing anything she is just gone
PonyGirl_82: aww don't say that about youself.
Polydunami do you mean my 100+ PC games
unless I'm missing something
:3
Where you tried looking around the next corner or on the other side?
PonyGirl_82, yo are the first person EVER to admit that.
Just being honest mate
Also, I'm fine with talking to women
I need to be taller is my problem!! Girls mainly go after taller guys (or at least in my past experiences)
Polydunami not counting xbox360, N64, PS2 and PS1
PonyGirl_82: i bet you have a great personality!
I'm well aware of my mingerdom and embrace it wholeheartedly :D
lol Globetrotter, you have more games than me
I have a LOT of games
But then I used to have a LOT of time
Ha, I have a SNES, ujelly? :D
PonyGirl_82: I'm going to risk sounding quite incredibly cliched here, but it's really personalities that matter, not looks
No
Damn
looks do help, but they aren't the most important thing
Also, are we describing our own looks now, PonyGirl_82?
No it isn't ScootaChickenm it's all about breasts, even if its a bloke, love me some man-boobs
Well my personality is certified insane :P
PonyGirl_82: it's what's in the inside that matters
Well I guess the worst thing about me is the bigass scar beneath my eye
oh god Globetrotter
ScootaChicken ikr?
xD
Oh mai.
I got pwned by fibreglass
My issues have issues
ah, so much love talk, lol
It hurt like an absolute bastard :c
issueception?
indeed
I like elegant women....you know, like a true 'lady'....aaaand, theres not really anymore of those around nowadays :D
^
00,03^^^
Nothing like me then RaveBrony
RaveBrony put a tophat on a whore?
^LOL
That looks like a legobrick
Closest I can get ya
It's what's on the inside that counts. Cliched, but I find it true. I just like someone who shares my interests and can make me laugh. And is POSITIVE.
that looks like an amazing image
I am like a guy, sit around scratching my arse drinking beer and eating chips XD
I only have one tiophat

Hipsters have taken the fedora
Hey Wrek is being optimistic gotta work with optimism

Hey Wrek!

05trusting yourself and not being staggered when denied goes along way
>Turn horses into Pegasi
Depends how I feel
I try to be optomisttic, but I'm sometimes pessimistic without thinking
optimism is glass half full ness :p pessimism is glass half empty Scoot-Scootaloo
/me found a girl he liked
Anyone got any good MLP pick up lines?? (For FUN! not real use) :D
>Invite her on flying chariot ride as you raind now lightning on the unjust

/me bursts into flames
Does anyone know the game wargasm?

Eh, just really bored ;)
hiya
:P
Good day Cavy
haha
Hey Cavy
hi
7god I forgot how creepy mibbit smilies are.
soo what did everypony vote for as A movie?
Sorry, entering BronyState from the real world is...difficult.
can i join in the TF2 server?
:)
has anypone ordered anything off of hasbro toy shop in the past? how good are they at posting status for an item?
7finally got saints row 3
the name is an essence of rule 34 you know
Cavy socail anxiety?
:O JEALOUS
rainbowjack that is

7>:D
Nahh.. I'm not in the closet about Ponies, anyway.
7...
7fucking mibbit.
ha
I could care less about what people think of it, so.
Hey everypony happy valentines day :)
7I'm not used to this shit any more.
I'll get it one day
Cavy: what do your friends think?
I've only ever watched someone else play Saints Row 2 >.< useless information~
ONE DAY ;_____;
happy vday toy
hello TOY_PON3!!
happy V-Day
oh i still havent told my friends i was think tomarrow would work out should i?
Whats up everypony?
moop :3
Half of em make fun of me. The rest are either Bronies, going to give it a chance eventually, or don't care too much.
Wow lots of people coming on suddenly
7SR2 is good. the PC version is a pile of old wrinkled bollocks, but Volition are douches in general to PC gamers
hello
/me bobs head to music
Hello those that have just arrived
same here
But the ones that are messing with me tell me it's all in good fun, so.
7which is weird, because THQ love us
Oh my..
/me does robot
TOY_PON3: :3 :3 :3 :3 :3 ( i never understood what this face meant)
haha
:L
Sophomore year is...interesting...
Um okay hi everypony that didn't say hi to me :P
moop: it's a cat face i think
so, the Blind Bags I ordered are on their way.
Hey TOY_PON3
hi TOY_PON3
no cat/butt face
Let's hope the US Postal Service doesn't fuck this up.
Dare I mention Skyrim?
Hi TOY_PON3
Hi RAWRity :)
Heya TOY_PON3.
I'm getting comic software soon, so I can finally get crap done.
awesome song is awesome
U.S. Postal Service <3
what does sophomore mean?
mario_pony: nocats have wiskers
Who's streaming?
Cavy: no. fuck the USPS. so hard.
haha
It's a grade, KwakLad.
Cavy: didn't they go out of business?
Wrek is streaming
Cool
7Nothing in Skyrim provides me any challenge any more. After Skuldafn whence I bound my favourite spells and weapons to hot keys and mauled my way through every mother fucker in that place fighting things is just a chore.
mario_pony: almost
be right back
brb lunch
good to know RAWRity
Do you play it on PC?
/me wondering how one is so good at sniping?
Oh, UPS, RAWRity?
7Yeah. Hotkeys.
due in no small part to the people in charge of the USPS having no clue how to run a fucking business.
my order still says has yet to be shipped. With the less than 3 hour sell out, I can see why they dont update my order status, I just hope it doesnt take any longer than an ebay shipment
in battlefield i suck
FedEx <3
Ahh I've only ever played it on PS3
7I don't think there's enough buttons for hot keys on a console...
back
Cavy: anyone other than USPS. They can go fuck themselves after what they did to my mom.
Anyway, Sophomore is basically your second year in High School.
nopony probably cares if i'm back or not
RAWRity: what did they do?
I wonder if I can join the game..
I only know them as UPS. Never heard USPS, are you not from state-side?
I CARE
whats this song callled?
/me cares
ohai RAINBOWCRASH
haha
I didn't even know what I was doing!! Let alone thinking about hotkeys :|
/me gives a damn
Cavy: no, UPS and USPS are 2 different things.
wow well then thanks I guess
I figured. Not entirely sure of the latter, though.
USPS is the United States Postal Service, and is run by the government.
UPS is a competing private company.
Ah..Yea.
AREA 51
whats this song called?
Eh, the way this country is being run at the moment, can't blame ya.
YEAH!
the government must go through ur things to make sure u r smuggling bomb or drugs
...stacey you have a ps3?
7Late in game becomes annoying if you're a mage. High mana cost of spells combined with low damage means I maxxed my smithing, got myself some dragonscale, a daedric sword double-legendary (97 base damage) with fire damage 31 and absorb health 21 enchantments and the mace of molag bal
USPS: upper super panda spacerocket
u r not*
awe massacre ended
Since Regan.
Nah I played it at Matt's XD
I only have a PS2.. still >_>
anypony know this song?
Who among us hasn't had a fued with thier post office. I've been feuding with mine for years, starting when the person delivering on my street was bending limited matted art prints to stuff in the mailbox.
7hey my PS2 is still plugged into my TV
HOLY CRAP I LOOKED UP AREA 51 ON GOOGLE MAPS AND SAW A UFO!!!
moop: no wai
U.S. is fine as is. Just corrupt politicians. A lot of work needs to be done, honestly. But Democracy, unlike communism, can work.
moop: lol
Anyway, enough with Politics.
give us the link moop
Still playing good old PS1 games on mine bwahaha
More Ponies.
mario_pony: my mom worked for the USPS for 20 years, but because she was on limited duty due to an injury sustained on the Job, the essentially said "we have no work for you" and put her out of work. When she applied for disability retirement, they said it would take 3-6 months to process. It took them 19.
brb
what that's funny
I have a few consoles, but I haven't played a video game in ages
Phase4: i was trolling
:P
7I switched from playing a mage to playing a melee character, Stacey
brb
so yeah, FUCK the USPS for everything they're worth.
r u 19?
Wait is the server full?
moop: i was joking :P
last thing I played was probably animal crossings or the sims 3 :L
Haven't wii'd for a while.. hmm hmm
Ah right
7you should get that checked out
Phase4: i know what you did last summer
unless iphone apps count XD
XD!
/me is just kidding
Actually.
RAWRity, no offense to your mom, but in reality, our Govenment thinks their are more important things to handle than your mom's retirement.
what was that song called?
I'll be back later.
It sucks, but that's their mindset.
moop: sit around in my underpants and browse the internet?
/me wonders if the server is full
omg, izzy's been going apeshit about me posting my status about my dad watching twilight :L
moop: its what i'm doing this summer too
Nah.
Hey toy_pon3
hey rainbro
I saw you weren't on. :(
oh yeah shit just got real!!
Sorry
what a lag...
It's fine.
Cavy: the government isn't in charge of what I'm talking about.
Fabulous!
Phase4: how do you know? its in the future bye then the world could be taken over by Parasprites
7lets play a game I like to call 'what scripts does dari still have active'
LAGG!
I just played TF2
7dwaggy

Hey is the server full? I think it is.
moop: its summer here now
7POOCHY

Or is retirement based on other services?
>dat old pokemon thing
I HAVE A PHOTO OF KIERAN FOR YOU.
Shizuka: Is the server full?
At least I think I am. :3
Not entirely educated on how that works.
I remember that.
13le nope
7Bitch you need to register this channel- I WILL END YOU BITCHWHORE

Phase4: your joking right its the middle of winter here !

BronyState streams don't end.
13guys it's 13 people on a residential line .-.
Long time no see guys.
moop: Australia mate
It might be because I'm only on the IRC channel and not the stream.
You're stuck here...FOREVER..

And.. what do you mean by torture? This can't end well
i gotta admit that prrostituets seem like they way to go
I'm going to be forever alone at this rate I'm to shy to talk to random people
its only the oldest proffesion
KwakLad: 'orbital friendship cannon' sounds better than 'planitary friendship cannon'
were no strangers too love you know the rules and soo do i
unless it's on a chat of course

i meant 17
Lol
ohh no then
i dont think
moop: no
Uh guys... What happend when I was gone -~-
moop: I know lol and yeah technically by law it is
I'm 17 and I see no appeal in 7 year olds.
Just because a 16 year old wants to be with a 21 year old doesn't make it right.
but the 17 year old is underage
i think its still illegal though (of age person X under age person)
Athena: I have no idea! *Medic voice*
Well guys, See ya later~ Happy V-Day or love day or whatevers~ lova you all<3
05WAIT is this...

lol giant wasps
Wrek no
/me rolls around in wool

moop try using tab with names. a lot easire
macro is one of my favorites
i don't see any thing wrong with a 25 year old watching MLP FIM
*easier
Some countries 18 is legal limit, 17 with consent. 16 I think some countries may have some problem with it.
^
05,15woah, why are we talking about age of consent?
i know some countries where its like 12
I dunno fluttercry~
you know what i say...
There isn't anything wrong with ANY age liking MLp

fluttercry: i just tabed back and first thing i read was your line

ummm TOY_PON3 im 15 i think one of my friends with a 20 year old is weird
Oh okay .~. Vote over-ruled
technically if a guy new a girl when she was 15 and she left and the never saw again but he still loved her when she was 18 would he be a pedo?
fillyfillyy: Get with a 60 year old
^^

Now wut?
Fact: I'm a brony, not pegasister
soo guys quick question...i want to start streaming some random game...on which site should i stream (by which i mean twitch.tv and those kind of games) ??
Anyway, article I read was by Faust and basically commented on any steriotypes in the show.
livestream
keep it simple
/me blushes at rainbro
Ie: Rainbow Dash and her sexuality. It was quite interesting.
:3
theres a person at school and i can tell if it is a girl or a boy
http://msmagazine.com/blog/blog/2010/12/24/my-little-non-homophobic-non-racist-non-smart-shaming-pony-a-rebuttal/
Cavy: go on
Teehee.

Buh bte
n'awww
"Rainbow Dash has rainbow-striped hair because of her name and because she is very interested in sports, specifically flying. She is a tomboy, but nowhere in the show is her sexual orientation ever referenced. As we all know, there are plenty of straight tomboys in the world, and assuming they are lesbians is extremely unfair to both straight and lesbian tomboys."- Faust
See you in 10 seconds flat

mario_pony: lol
fans directing an episode? OH GOD NO. SO MANY MEMES.
...
Moop?
RAWRity?
yes?
05,15It would start Derpy, and involve Lyra and Bon Bon shipping
:D
ya?
RAWRity: that could work either extreemly well or extreemly badly
I was getting ignored.
05,15star *
maybe only as a last hurrah episode
So I thought I was invisible.
awwwww rainbro :(
Thanks guys.
fluttercry: it would litereally be nothing but shouting memes at the audience.
sorry rainbro
:)...there wouldnt be enough kid friendly content to air a 22 minute episode, moop
everyone gives lots of love to rainbro :) <3
i think im always invisible so i say BOO! to scare people
Cypresswolf: but it would still be hilarious
Just shouting 20 PERCENT COOLER. DEAL WITH IT. TROLOLOLOLOLOLOL FLUTTERSHY IS A TREE EEYUP. EENOPE. EEYUP. SPIKE HAS A CRUSH ON RARITY! etc. ad nausiem.

generally speaking, letting fans take over a show doesn't end well, ebcause they latch onto certain things that THEY think are important, and ignore other elements that make the show what it is. That's what's happened with later seasons of the Simpsons. New writers being brought onto the show had a different idea of what the show should be after watching it, and it suffered in quality as a result.
your face!
/me runs to see if he's going to be ok

what did you play as?
Soldier
and thats why
with near max AR
oh yh
Ingwaz: which atlas
the ATLAS Mech
theres a new system for me3 in place, the more weapons you carry, the slower your power cooldown time is, unless you're a soldier
then its not really affected
Alright everypony... I need to be getting to bed.

Hello tgl1992 NullRadix and Mahboi777.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLQbk30Yi4
If Weird Al did accept, the episode would appear near the end of season 3 or beginning of the alleged season 4.
holy crap
inb4 he plays a villian
HAHA
alleged season 4?
I could see Al bein a villain
There will be an episode airing on March 10th that will feature time travel in some way
of MLP
No one knows if it has been confirmed (to my knowledge), so it is alleged, or imagined
WHAT?
I can picture him as some pony showing up at one of Pinkie's Parties and showing her up
hay everypony
Polka Duel
Well well well, howdy MasterBrony.
what makes MLP so cool it has the balls to show DRAGONS!!!! dragons make anything 19% cooler
i just got done having a bad day
"Wanna see my accordian?"
hey MasterBrony
Hi hi MasterBrony
Nothing's confirmed, but apparently, Twilight will be visited by her future self

TheDr: I have no clue either
ALL OF MY ANGER
05,15TheDr she drank out of a punch bowl...and the fandom ran with it

i guess thats how it works :)
she dunked her HEAD into the punch bowl!
After this week's episode, the next will be March 3

Call of the Cutie. She sips from a punch bowl
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9Lb-ZBXxkM
i.must.fin.it
Jams her entire head into it! Nearly tipping it over!
please pardon my face spam but :D:D:D:D:D:D
No, she doesn't
/me is glad that according to StinkomanFan, most of his own pony lore is correct
why is dash so rad?
She just takes a sip
um
she baths in rainbow thats it :)
She laps it like a dog!
Berry kind of guzzles from it like a horse to water
lol
well it's TRUE
rainbows be spicy I guess
indeed, not for drinking
pretty but potent unpotables
for baths
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZaSFLVa1PM Oh looky, pointless links

StinkomanFan: what if she finds out?
StinkomanFan: someday man, someday.
Well, I told him I dont wanna jump into a relationnship, since he's a bit scared of commitment. I said all I wanna do is just go out and do stuff you know? Take it slow.
dat fan cartoon...
Because seriously, I've never been so happy.
Howdy Everyone.
LadyCanary|yay: /)
Howdy Placebo.
hey Placebo
Hey Placebo

Hi Placebo!
08,01StinkomanFan: how'd you break into her locker?

08,01last time i broke into a locker, it was for my boss, who wanted to spy on my other boss
I pulled it open

LadyVanary|yay: at least yall can still be good friends
Thank you TOY_PON3.

MahBoi777: Well...we actually may have sorta kissed a bit. >///////<

MahBoi777: O u

I broke into my crushes locker, Toy_Pon3 hooked up with a gal and Lady Canary got a BF
Forever Alone it seems for me.....
Placebo: well TOY_PON3 made out with his date

08,01i think i killed Phase4
lol

i'm ok
Like I said, Im not jumping into a relationship so quickly. It's gone sour for me when I've done that.
LadyCanary|yay: Same here
LadyCanary|yay: Testing the water, as it were? :D
hey Phase4|Reading
ohai MahBoi777
Exactly.
killed is a harsh term, maybe you should go with "Mortally Distracted"
Long story short mine went a LOT better than any other one
Placebo you're not mad that I kissed another pony :(
TOY_PON3: I'm happy for ya, bro.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
lol
Thanks Placebo :D
On the other hand, My relationship is about to end.. So yeah.
:(
Meh.
I'm so sorry to hear that Placebo.
^
And you wonder why I thought you were a Colt Cuddler :|
^ LOL
So.
EEYUP
Do you think it's bad that I took my friend out to go eat at In N' Out?
TOY_PON3: Your filly friend?
Yes
Well, as a first impression, that's kinda.. odd.
not bad.
I couldn't afford some fancy restuarant :(
But I mean, you can't always take 'em to a 3 star restraunt.
I've seen worse dates
Hey, if she liked it, isn't that all that matters?
Better to see the real you off the bat, then spend 3 months getting to know a fake you, IMO.
^^
One couple was shot to death on one date
Of course that couple was Bonny and Clyde
^ Most unspecific homocide ever.
/me is not sure to feel bad or sad
StinkomanFan: My Gf's great uncle (or something like that) Was one of the cops that caught and killed Bonny and Clyde.
TOY_PON3 if you believe everything went well, feel happy instead.
heyyyyy, I live very close to where they got shot
1,3:3
Well Placebo I wasn't trying to impress her I just wanted to spend the evening with her and yeah then THAT happened lol
Everlasting_Joy: She enjoyed it she said
Then be happy.

kirzstryfe: Wut.
TOY_PON3: Now you just need saxy music.

Placebo: Not a bad idea..

Me Gusta Jelly
0,14good to hear, LadyCanary|yay
LadyCanary|yay: It took me 4 episodes, then a week break to realize I really enjoyed them.
Well besides the ones on here that is ^^'

...
Placebo: Took me only one episode ^^
I only have two other kids in my school that openly likes MLP
JUST BECAUSE I LIKE IT
WHAT A BITCH
StinkomanFan: That's cool
One of them is a HUGE DICK

/me hates FB

otakon for what?
/me has a facebook, thats about it

(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
Facebook is obselete to me
I had an EA account when I signed up for a Sims social club
TopHat: That's not nice to hurt poor Fluttershy..
Oh dear god Sims Social.
i use if fot the chat, pidgin suports it
That went terribly
for'
you need a Facebook account and a EA account
Sims Social, um yeah NO
for this to work
I'd smoke my FB account if I didn't have brony friends who I should stay in contact with.
lol i used to say facebook was for losers with no life yet i spend all my time on bronystate
lol
TopHat: how may we help you sir?
lol?
Oh my. I need to DL the ME3 Demo.

otakon: I take it you need it badly?

I hope not
alright...:| screw studing. this chapter on cranes is hacking me off. Ill to the test in the morning when Im relaxed enough to think
StinkomanFan: lol
Cypresswolf: I find studying while having BS open impossible.
Cypresswolf I know the feeling.
Damn I haven't played Sims in like forever
the birds or the machinary?
By charactor crapped herself to death!
Wow
wut.
....
:O
Needless to say I HATE the Sims
why wasn't there any pepto in the house??
TOY_PON3: I'd say we should play sims3 Together.. but that would probably end naughty.
Well that, *shades, was a crappy ending.
Oh mai.
inb4 yeah.
Placebo: Indeed <3
Everlasting_Joy: YEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAHHH
lmao
BS wasn't open. logged off just to concentrate. I just dont know diddly about cranes. not licensed to use one anyway, only 4 crew members out of 25+ have knowledge to operate one.
!ping
And It took me 5 hours to set up!
try !ping, its a good way to test if your internets down
StinkomanFan: booo
11,01otakon: No offense, but excuse me while I laugh my ass off at EA continuing to make their games even harder to play fully for various bullshit.
Phase4: I prefer 'marco'
yeah
HAHA
Im currently on deliveries until this safety training is fone
hey all im back
*done
NullRadix: that works too
5 in-game DAYS to figure out wtf I needed to do to get everything going!
hi fillyfillyy
Nittany_Discord: I agree
BF3 players got the MP demo AND the SP demo early
hi fillyfillyy
Nittany_Discord You're preaching to the choir on this one.
... or at least it should...
11,01Though I'm skeptical about needing Facebook to playing online.
/me glares at... everyone
Meh. EA can make me jump through hoops all they want if they keep the quality of Games like Mass Effect up.
/me hates FaceBook -.-
hi Mahboi777 and TOY_PON3
Weeeeell if it isn't fillyfillyy.
fillyfillyy: Hey

hi Everlasting_Joy Placebo and Mutterguy
11,01EA will make you jump through hoops and parent you.
/me glares back at NullRadix
hiya fillyfillyy
EA can go die in a hole, releasing the same thing over and over again for a cheap buck
/me loves useing the tab thing on names
I CANNOT BLINK
hi otakon
11,01You mean Activision?
MahBoi777 Weeping Angel near you?
Has Madden NFL really changed in the past 5 YEARS?

StinkomanFan: "Madden" is the problem there.
/me hands MahBoi777 some eyedrops
1,3cheerilee song is good song :)
Nittany_Discord: they apparently announced awhile back that BF3 buyers would get access to the SP/MP demo a full month ahead of time then everyone else. Also, the MP portion of the demo isn't officially open to the rest of LIVE until Friday.
11,01Activision is milking the success of SoD to death.

Everlasting_Joy: maybe, lol
Mario_pony, listen to Duck Tales theme :) Always works

Tyhe bartender shrugs. And served a shot. THe pony drinkis it, and says. "Okay, now may I have a beer?"
13assuming this seed stays with me... this torrent was near death when i started it...

The bartender blinks, but serves one. The Pony drinks, and asks, "And last, may I have a glass of Sake?"
00,10well duh /pinkie
Shizuka: keep it to yourself. I do not need to know ;)
lol
13maybe.... tomorrow night? or thursday at the latest if i lose the good seed tonight

Shizuka... can you give me a hint as to what it is... through PM of course ^_^
helping with dishes, back sooon
13up through... 17 of about 50 ish

lol
13got that too~
13but this isn't it

...
And the pony replies- "Well, I've had a hard day. I NEEDED those drinks. You try to keep up with Twilight Sparkle sometime. And as for why they are all different, well..."
13thought sumica streamed gargoyles... and finished it
oh
13or somepony was
what... AND I MISSED IT! T___T *suicides*
Hello! Any pony artists around looking to make some quick cash? I'm hiring artists for some sketch comics, pay is per panel and in advance. Message me if you'd like to learn the details.

Just as planned ^__^
'Ba-dum-swwish.
Kencolt: SWAG
00,10You are welcome to stream any thing I ahve streamed Shizuka
RAINBOWCRASH: i get what you mean, it can get pretty lonesome sometimes. but, look at it this way, when you're without someone, its an opportunity to improve yourself. its hard to put in to words. Just because you dont have somepony now, does not mean you cannot in the future. The times of waiting will make it all the more important to you for when you do have somepony as well
wall o' text
dat wall of text
Wait, whiskey comes from corn? Didn't know that
whiskey is delicious
^
so is scotch
13that's why they call it corn whiskey .-.
Yes. yes it doesn except for rey whiskey.
and bourbon
cider cider cider cider
yes but I'm shy and can't really communicate so...
and vodka... rum... tequila...
/me likes alcohol instead of beer
i have a habit of posting walls o' text i've noticed
Ok.. the joke didn't fly, I guess...
I like brandy myself
Midnight_Tempest: You and me should go out for a drink sometime ^^
yes
yes we must
:)
and I've improved my pesonality as best as I could except for the being shy part
i will drink you under the table TOY_PON3
<3
LOL
All I see, by the way, is a pixelated Celestia. Who looks surprised. Guess we're still waiting on something.
theres a special somepony out there for you, the hard part is the waiting
hello everypony, i see there is a new broadcast window
i like the refresh button
Whazzup Everypony!
TOY_PON3: remember when I said I stayed up for 4 days straight... I was drinking 80% of that whole stretch
I can't wait for da sax music
Midnight_Tempest: Wow o.o
it was fabulous
It's hard to talk to someone about to help when you're to shy to talk to someone ecpecially since this world is full of jerks and such
yay more Futurama
too QUIET!
huzzah!
well I'm gonna go shower brb
MahBoi777: Deja Vu :D
LOL
huzzah moar Futurama
lol
Oh god
well goodnight you guys :)
Zapp
ohg od WHY!?
Goodnight TheDr
night TheDr sleep well
SO HOT!!!
^__^
RAINBOWCRASH: there are indeed a lot of jerks, but there are good people as well. its the good people that make it worth it. And just because you have trouble talking doesnt mean anything. speech alone isnt the only method of communication. Not everypony wants a talker for their special somepony. Some ponies like a talker like pinkie pie, some ponies like a shy one like fluttershy
gnight TheDr take care
moar wall o text
Goodnight Doctor
Night TheDr
better get used to it toy_pon3, i do that a lot it seems
i want an angry dome
I guess i'm a fluttershy
dat dome o anger
that doesn't help me any but thanks
Personality test says I'm Rainbow Dash
wut
Ingwaz: I don't mind you're a good consulant
^^
same here but i'm more of fluttershy
consultant*
RAINBOWCRASH: What i'm basically trying to say is. you need to be okay with yourself. Theres nothing wrong with being shy. Some people seriously do prefer the shy ones over the talkative ones.
do you consider yourself an empathetic person rainbowcrash?
The shy people are normally the nicer people
I am ok with myself but I'm always sad on hearts and hooves day
^
BBl-- I need to check a few things.
/me is crazy
:3
:D
and i'm back!
welcome back Mutterguy
see ya later Kencolt
it does kind of suck rainbowcrash, felt that a few times today. But, just look towards the future rather than being condemned by your past
later Kencolt
Yay!
ponies!
spirit is best pony
Didn't hurt me ^__^
damn
*never
Everyone i know who outgoing and eccentric arenormally the annoying or mean people
well, pinkie pie is both, and shes neither annoying or mean
im just saying everyone i know...
/me turns into a pony and gallops aroudn the chat

/me hops on Midnight_Tempest and rides him
^^

Sumica: im pretty sure the have coffee in equestria... but if not, take some coffee beans with you in case
00,10I dont like coffiee, I prefer my caffeene cold
Ingwaz: I usually make things awkward just to mess with the other ponies ^^
Ingwaz: im gonna see that movie cause it sounds so freaking hilarious

Polydunami: he's streaming

It's really a close adaptaion tothe radio show. (Which at the moment, I do not have.)

SuperBrony63: this is nice stuff, thanks
so amazing i'm speechless
it's a e-reader!
LOL
damn this is damn impressive
dude if this was my wonderland, i'd take the blue pill and see how far it goes... -refferance-
What am I watching?
Matrix ftw
and the narrator is GREAT
stick yo finger down his throat?
a drink OUT of a Vogon
One of teh great scenes.
Kind of jumpy, ennem?
mmmmm tasty
um
that looks horrible...
um...
blue twinkie with green paste?
it's an aquired taste
apparently
ewwww
LOL
the Vintrassi
So who's the main guy, if I may ask?
hmm, don't remember them from the book tbh
Arthur Dent
the one in the robe
Oh
Right
and Ford, the one in the pinstripe suit
robe beats suit
so stunguns no good?
The things about Dent is, he spends most of the series-- TV, Radio, and novels-- in a state of Not-qite there outrage and has every reason to do so. Oh, and he's probably the most important person in the universe, but...
I'd take one for sure
Kencolt: nice
dem sound effects
Well, it's TRUE.
so this is all JUNK to him?
lol
no serioulsy
I'd take the psychic helmet
I'm liking this so far
dat towel
I's take a stun gun
do you
i have a towell...
Me too
I had a towel
it's gone now though
he's got a towel!
dont forget to bring a towel
take him out!
i sleep with it cause it inspired me
dem babel fish
put a fish in ur ear, lol
Ford does know what he's talking about. Everyone else tendsto get a bit puzzled. Except Zaphod, who is kind of perma-puzzled anyway, but he's not aware of it.
there are many towels, but this onne is mine
i want that fish!!!
eet is so tiny! eez funneh to me
u can uderstand anything people say that would be awesome
crap
NOT VOGON POETRY!
Yep
good cuts
DEARJEEBUSNUSH
Otakon, It could be worse. Except it blew up.
Kencolt: good point
/me was gonna watch Leverage till he noticed what was on the stream
lol
one more SuperBrony63 please!
DO IT
this is also why i love bronystate. AWESOME FEEDS
Um... Proto-- Not exactly awesome, as will be explained fairly soon in the next desgment.
indeed
... Please?
you can catch GREAT shows here
it's just awesome
hell, I didn't even know this existed
I knew of the radio show though
Super
08,018 hours late...
Oh
SuperBronie64
You.. You didn't? Wow. It was a six episode TV epic, and was a genuine classic.
08,018% i lost for tardiness
Kencolt: enope
08,01but at least it's done.
SuperBrony64 next film....
only 8% lost, thats not so bad
08,01i like writing essays, except when i leave them to the last minute like this
SuperBrony64 you there?
SuperBrony64 needs tacos now
hmmm
08,01otakon: i can still get an A, theoretically
Didn't cover all the radio eps-- but did wind up selfcontained. With Scrbble.
true, but I doubt your professor is that generous
Taco Time is completely understandable
hmmm
Well, SuperBrony63, is it an intermission or what?
did he say he was going to get tacos?
08,01also.. i kinda answered the essay question by saying "the essay question is meaningless"
08,01which it was.
08,01so f[yay]k that.
What was the essay question?
otakon: he ALWAYS needs tacos, it's fuel
indeed
also
Don't diss the tacos...

Paraphrased, of course ^__^

silly filly server O.o?
LOL
I wanna see a QR code show up on some Equestrian post or something like that on an episode
and hes stuck
lol Simon, that was fast
Hey ehrenthedragon, need a hand?
But in general, the two known Alicorns-- Celastia and Luna-- are generally accepted in Fanon to epitomise the perfection of all three tribes. Faust, however says... They are a mystery. unknown, unexplainable...
dem alicorns
Such enigmas
Minecraft.
And my entire page crashed..
she added the Alicorn because there was one in the G1 series of MLP
In other words, we're NEVER going to get ANYBUCKING CANON about them. They just ARE.
I love mystery in a mare ;)
Arguing about Alicorns?
the inner mechanisms of my mind are an enigma...
Because they are Celestia and Luna. And we just have to deal.
LAUREN! Y U NO DEBRIEF ALICORNS?!?!
I can't decide if I like Celestia or Luna more
in other words MahBoi777... the wheel is turning but the hamster is dead, right?
Wub woona :3
Midnight_Tempest: precisely
I'm going to say yes on that one
niether can i
^__^
lol
you know... i would play minecraft... if it wasn't so UNGODLY BORING!
teh silliness
Luna's adorable, but Celly feels...
We're not supposed to know. We're not EVER supposed to know. They are Magical Princesses. That's all we NEED To know. And all they are likely ever to tell us.
Boring? Really?
I kind of wanna say motherly.
i find it boring
game crash?
hax!
Chunk error still?
it's beautiful
THERE we go
Minecart racing!
It's basically, Celestia can do whatever she wants-- unless it's the Element thing. And Luna can do pretty much the same-- although, I suspect, only with Celly's OK. Kinda on probation, but she seems OK with that.
server details?
fasten your seatbelts
It's gonna be a bumpy ride
Harmony is a greater power than even Celestia... but it seems it has found it's proper champions. Who, well... can be idiots, but that's kind of the point.
