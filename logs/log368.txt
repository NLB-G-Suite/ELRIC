it feels like my little pony is slowly taking over everything
it just might be me
It already has
^
think I stopped playing TF2 shortly after it became F2P
I've seen F1 videos with pony references in
no it hasn't
... got owned by them too much
F2P TF2 is easy
Becasue all the F2P are nubs and easy to kill
odd
Lol, wrek's a dobbr

estonian opening theme... kinda weak (sorry)
yea
lol
In PL version of course.
Liaek cabbag
as much as i saw in the comments they said that the voice actors were kids of some of our voice actors
dunno
i guess it's aimed towards kids cause they don't know about the fanbase yet
dunno, i guess that's just me, they might know
they might not
Sorry, I kinda spoke my mind there :o
for some reason the saying that our prime minister said about acta about them eating seeds and not the ones you plant in the ground thing popped into my head
dunno
ooooh Adventure

'dat song
It turns to ice once it has passed

I know many a 13 year old with deepish voices

0,5HELLO EVERYONE
hi lc
Uh oh
0,5No racism. >.>
Hello LC
Hai LC
freezing rain at the best of times
you live in Houston?
yep
well then, I'll be close to you in a few month. coming to Amarillo in May :)
Oh dear
pls no remind me of that song
I g2g everypony my inspiration knows no bounds it would seem
Nice! into anime convetions?
Pinkie pie is inspector
05MY FAIC
sometimes when i think that i came up with a clever joke i type and after i press enter i regret it :)
MY MOUTH IS BURNING
I don't usually go to conventions
The first thing that's even close to a convention is Silverstone for the Brtish Grand Prix this year
Which I'm going
is snipers pee poisonous?
Snipahpiss tends to make crits happen
ahh
the only convention in Belgium that's worthwhile is called F.A.C.T.S.
When someone is covered in it, minicrits occur
Which is 1.5x damage
Don't worry
no
We're a strange bunch
Period? um...
if you're having periods, then you're a girl
first off, i don't like smoking and i despise drinking
no fazan
Ohhhh
THAT period
Sorry, I'm not American
.
Period =/ Full stop
oh amn they are soo good they are fries smothered in chees with halapenos slices on top my mouth waters just thinking about them.
yea
I know, just being silly
Let me look that up a moment
I like the pizzas from Papa Johns
by saying weird i also mean i like things that others don't
or i simply like it quite a lot
but there's non-english eps
If you know people of this day and age, you wouldn't think that frankly
yea
he's actually one person i wouldn't show it
Spaey
I'm slowly educating a friend in memes. Eventually I'll show him ponies
never tried it
Though
I have susptions
like an apple
whys that?
He makes references every now and then
heh, rarity
hmm., May 25th... my flight back home is on 27th from Amarillo. gonna see how far away those two cities are
The teacher was like "Which animals evolved to develop hooves"
He said, "Unicorns and pegasi"
How long are you visiting?
17th till 27th
That's not a girl.......
It's a tiddler
and Amarillo and Houston are a good 10 hours drive :p
No, I'm pretty sure said person is a 10 year old boy
Lol
I have.
i think that it's the most epic one yet
<<
I saw it the first day it came
sometimes I really hate Britain
Most brits are now americanisms rather than Brits
Oh hey DWR~
why's that?
I don't have anything agaisnt America
thats actually a pretty solid reason
britian tried to be m'multicultural' and failed
Hey mario_pony~
It's just their culture is contanimating ours
i am back
Every day I have to corect people for "Couch" "Movie"
Anyone else noticed how the UK has loads of 'american candy' shops?
Yeah.
They're everywhere
The Halloween bullshit with dressing up and begging for food didn't happen here either. :/
Then suddenly, everywhere.
Hello!
I like halloween
well we have to seperate "halloweens"

I never liked halloween. Never went trick or treating
Wouldn't want to soak the tiddlers
just enough to wet them
Oh well
Unsual? I disagree

You can come anytime, anywhere

You guys are keeping me away from suiciding forthe lols
it's an old word, right?
Tiddler = I forget which dialect it originated from, but it means little kids
It is also a type of fish

i know that toddler is little kids but oh well
that's right, the basic swimming classes at my pool were called tiddlers

Wish I was one of those poor gunned down saps in Chicago
Valentines day at my school, or at least amongst my grade, is kind of a joke :p

Mostly because I'm 14.

Umm... Sea pony?
Rarity had, in my opinion the second best comical line ever... "This isn't whining. This is Complaining. THIS IS WHIIIIIINING>>>"
Paraphrased, of course ^__^

Hey ehrenthedragon, need a hand?
dem alicorns
Such enigmas
And my entire page crashed..
In other words, we're NEVER going to get ANYBUCKING CANON about them. They just ARE.
Arguing about Alicorns?
Because they are Celestia and Luna. And we just have to deal.
I can't decide if I like Celestia or Luna more
I'm going to say yes on that one
niether can i
^__^
lol
Luna's adorable, but Celly feels...
We're not supposed to know. We're not EVER supposed to know. They are Magical Princesses. That's all we NEED To know. And all they are likely ever to tell us.
Boring? Really?
I kind of wanna say motherly.
i find it boring
hax!
it's beautiful
THERE we go
Minecart racing!
It's basically, Celestia can do whatever she wants-- unless it's the Element thing. And Luna can do pretty much the same-- although, I suspect, only with Celly's OK. Kinda on probation, but she seems OK with that.

It's gonna be a bumpy ride
