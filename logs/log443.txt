Lil_B: not really, more like that Bruce Willis meteor movie
Invi: Well it was doing a good job until i got violated!
How do they have gravity on the ship btw? If we're not advanced enough to be able to send an unmanned vessel on the mission, how can we be advanced enough to create artificial gravity?
Sumica: They're going to die, now arrent they?
/me hugs back VioletGreySha

Words do not exsist for the discomfort I feel o_________O
LP?
2!pokemon
Ran, you are a 4Lugia.
2!eonget
6k Cantigrad is by my math 60K what is colder then the coldest winter on earth...
2<3
Vordox isn't desintegrated = seperated into atoms = atomized?
Lil_B: 6,000 centigrade
...not specific enough?
Err...wait yeah true :P
6k C is quite hot
lololol
Wrong word coice of me.
FlareChaser: want me to auto refresh? :D
:)
panda: sure? ahahaha
srry
05there's the grav thingy btw
Om: compared to The Wall, this is nice
00,10man that is a big washing machine.
FlareChaser: hehe :D I need some more views too ^^
CrazyCherry: Why do you do this to meeee T~T
/me giggkes at Om
/me tickles Om
fun fact, in a real space ship you'd actually hear the groaning of the ship's metal warping in the heat
panda: Naw, you dont have to refrsh, I think I'll just make more pics.
Kandarihu: I liked The Wall tho.
Giggles*
maybe i understood it wron. is is 6k Centigrad as in 6000° Celcius or 6K Centigrad as in... well 6000 CentiKelvin?
the wall, are you referring to pink floyd? Kandarihu
Raaan :D
Fus ro Doh!
Lil_B: Celsius
FlareChaser, hehe sounds like a plan ^^
I can't wait till I see All Bronystates reaction to my vote if it ever gets taken. 80s ANIME MOVIE BUCK YEAH!
centigrade=celsius
Lil_B the difference isn't that big
eyup
what a nice girl
2Fus roh dawww!
The Wall, specifically.
Om: Because you're funny when you're unconfortable
oh sorry but i am back i was playing angry bird
!pokemon
Lil_B: There is no such thing as centikelvin
*birds
Vordox: What 80s Anime movie are talking about here?
Slyphoenix: Can't say, I want it to be suprise.
CrazyCherry: Its not funny to me! Isn't that what matters :$
This movie has angst in it. The Wall is pure concentrated angst.
The Walll movie is more like just a long music video, there's more story in the song itself than the movie
I know thats hat what confused me
I bet about..1 out of 10000000 eard of it.
Vordox: Okay then :)
But its a INFAMOUS movie for anime fans. =3
but now I'm cleared XD
Even by those standards.
/me giggles at Om
that guy is so cool
!pokemon
Nick, you are a 7Regigigas.
yay my fave regi
>Infamous
dat signal noise
05iirc the only difference between celsius and Kelvin is that kevlins "0" is on the absolute zero (256 or sumthin)
Scarecrow is never scared
Om: Nope.
I've seen enough hentai to know where this is going
CrazyCherry: >_> damit...
yeah kelvin degrees are the same as celsius degrees, just offset to absolute zero
!pokemon
bluesun, you are a 12Celebi.
Wrek: 273 actually
-273.15
Sunshine has people who are trying to save Earth, even if it costs their own lives. The Wall is about raging against everything in society.
05thanks
05273
o.o
sunshine should be terrible for lots of reasons
/me throws master bal at bluesun!
but it's not
Ijust didn't know that Centigrad=Celcius, i thought someone missunderstood Kelvin
hi
So yeah 60K would be pretty cold
open up GIMP...
/me just started a horribly distracting argument, didn't he?
/me reverses time and runs

/me nuzzles Om

Om: I see you've found CrazyCherry. :)

05DSNesmith, that comment was completly unecessary and yo should feel ashamed
Om: No i wooo'oont!

00,10you know...... it's kinda odd they desgined the ship to be able to dock with it's self
Stop the movie,I'm getting something too drink

/me finds a corner and lays down twitching
Fattonie: not many ideas to vote for :(
I'm the staraptor thats too full of herself to care
yes, Space is, by definition 0K
The low temperature of space would not actually cause astronauts to freeze after a few seconds without space suits, as there is no medium to absorb their body heat. (wikipedia)
/me gives Om a cookie "Sorry"
/me comforts Om "its gonna be ok..."
Isn't that absolut zero already?
Om: dont feel so down, i still love you
Cold doesn't matter if there's nothing for your body heat to diffuse into
oooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaak i am back mofos

hai Colder
on AVERAGE it's slightly higher than 0, but realistically it's 0
because there's nothing there to HAVE temperature
Well, they're close to a star, so even behind a shield or a planet, it's not going to be 0 kelvin.
Pleas no more physical contact...
It's about 4 degrees above
i want such a damn suite
i'll take some soda
DSNesmith: there is
not that a few kelvin makes a difference anyway
I think
DSNesmith: very few molecules, but there are
there is a very, very small amount of matter
this part
but Ran can go super saiyin
right ran?
Hey everypony!! Whatre we watching? :)
movie?
i'm finally back
/me hugs Om.
^
SPAAAAAAACEEE
now as someone said, of course, they're not in deep space
hai RaveBrony
Om: No more after this. :)
RaveBrony: Sunshine
DSNesmith: Well, technically space vacuum isn't an absolute vacuum, but yeah
RankWinner: sunshine sunshine ladybugs awake
freeclimbing? that's for wusses. try freeSPACING
RaveBrony: Hi! We are watching Sunshine
:O
he lost something
GilDash: ......fine......Pinkie primse
Nice sa...oh fu
Hiya Michael and ty Kandarihu and Slyphoenix :P
05no depreassurizing? bye bye eardrums
bye harvey
ded
he is chilling
Om: Cross my heart and hope to die, stick a cupcake in my eye.
so what happened anyway, where are they
Temperature=atomic movement of matter, there is close too 0 matter in space, ergo there isn't any matter they even could move, so space is by definition total zero
which one was harvey?
i kinda missed a part
O.o
ouch, dat represurrization
2Of course
Harvey is ded D:
so after this movie there will be no more chat utill the next steam
GilDash: Alright no more for now >.> I'll belive you.
Lil_B: no, its not 0. its a bit above it.
GilDash: Did you really just do that? o.o
right?
now realistically his eyes would boil
02Not with me right aside :<
2I've got the hair and everything :D
>.> Erm....That's...not how space works...right?
not better super super speed
05twilight_sprinkler: if you're not goign to pay attention to the movie I have no lust to recapp whats been goign on
.. Ehm..
02Right? :<
spaaaaaaaaaaaaace
was his face unprotected?......
i'm finally back bronies!
o_o
Ouch
Wrek: hmmmm, or maybe i was gone, no?
Ow.
That must hurt
god
/me pfts and crosses wings
oh shit that looks horrible! :(
AGH FREEZEBURN
Ouchies!
2Chaos Twiiiin
damn
Dat freeze
dem eyes
Fun fact. Space ain't THAT cold. :P
fancy suit
I'm back again. Was I missed?
At 0 kelvin. i mean..
fancy suit
Well sure it's cold cold, but...Err.
he would freeze instantly
02Chaoz twin
That suit looks like a prob from spaceballs :D
Sylandest: Nothing.
Airpuff: I think Ommy was having a panic attack. How would I tease him then? ;)
Who would?
prop
05as stated earlier Airpuff
05apparently if no medium is there to absorm his heat
Airpuff: he became a popsicle
05he wouldnt freeze
Instantly frozen, then instantly incinerated. Crazy way to go.
Om: I was asking if I was missed...apparently not...lol
lag is not funny
also you won't "explode" in space
Sylandest: sorry but i dont know you ^^ i can miss you later lol
05but yeah im not gona debate the issue since im not qualified
not enough air inside you for that kind of pressure
explode twice in space
true
How he get covered in ice? There's no moisture in space.
Lil_B refering to that nowhere is perfect vacuum, and the teperature is also measured in electromagnetic radiation, you are wrong and space has a average temperature of 15°K
:(
Things freeze because the heat (atomic movement) goes into something with less atomic movement
Sylandest: ....I knew that >>
OH that
panda: no worries, lol
poor guy :(
inb4 this guy saves them all later
your lungs will expand and your chest will distend, but you won't pop like a balloon
:o
Om: uh-huh ;)
yeah your brain would clod boil
Wrek ... well i gues one coul say that.. .still the vaccum would pretty much kill them instantly without a helmet xD
o____o
00,10SirGanjalf the moisture in him and on him
look it up
now that's how to go out
EEK
Sylandest: I missed you. ;)
nvm
Good MOOOORNING
DON'T WORRY GUYS! he had sun glasses.
/me hates that he missed the start of the movie....
:(
GilDash: :D Well of course you did. You need me to balance out, lol
happy face
Vordox: well did he have sun block?
hai Kandarihu

/me blinks
it was the synthetic
rfol^
xD
that's fischer from inception?
rofl*
it's an over used mame
/me puts rarity's Drama-couch beside Om and puts him atop of it. Now. Feel free to go dramamode.
Colder: I think so yes
twilight_sprinkler ok, space itself is ~00000000001K, your body will not drop that much heat actually, becasue there also isn't much matter to which your temperature could get transported to, + the energy coming from the sun will heat your body up a bit, the problem i see is that your body will explode inside of space
Colder: Yup, and Scarecrow from Batman
Vordox: where the hell do they sell SPF 100 billion? I WANT!!!!
F***
Sylandest: No, I need Om to balance out. I need *you* to bounce suggestiveness off. ;)
Airpuff: Play nice with Om! :|
I agree with LiLb
F***ING WHY? JUST...GOD...why?
panda: Bad idea :P
GilDash: haha, true. I am the innocent one here, or so I tell myself
Hey FlareChaser!
Vordox: hm? how come?
Sylandest: Yeah, right. ;)
Mace is my favorite character in this movie
2I've never understood why people are so blalghghg'd out by the Lavender theme
twilight_sprinkler: the vaccum would kill them no matter what
RaveBrony: Hey :|
Whats wrong?
O.o
panda: Why would yo uneed it? XD
Lil_B: makes sense. i only said that the the temperature of space isnt 0. i dont know the density of matter in space to say about him losing heat or not
Lil_B temperature can be transportet by microwaves for example
you can survive in space a very short while
GilDash: i gave him a sofa?! Isnt taht good enough for ya! xD
Airpuff: I'm not dramatic. I just don't enjoy all that, touchy hulabaloo!
GilDash: Well, I am! :P
Vordox: XD
hello jello faces
i love space movies
>:D
dat mozilla crashing :D
Airpuff: Not instantly
Airpuff: ik, i never denied it. all i said was that space temp isnt 0
spaaace
kill him
RaveBrony: pic done yet? :P
brb need a drink
Well they're fucked.
SirGanjalf, but the amout of time that they we're in space would be enough i think
cue shed music
00,10kill em any ways
kill her too
erm, gunnaeatchabrains
brb
FlareChaser: Not quite.... i may have to tweak some things.... I drew your OC in the wrong spot on the 2nd piece of paper....
Kill her instead
Invi ok i can only state what i leared so far, maybe my teacher simplified it. I'm gonna check it later maybe, i like sience XD
RaveBrony: ah, okay....
Kill everyone and say you did it for science :D
:\
The needs of the many outway the needs of the few or the one.
sorry

(fuuuuuuFUUUUFFUUUUUU!!!!)
Kill the suicidal man!

uh oh
*blows
00,10sonic scalple? wtf

lol
i want such a thing
o_o

inb4 they clap their hooves, the sun explodes, and everything does a little shake
:(
Magical_pablez94: Hiya!!

O__O
He doesn't look so good.
i like blood
remembers me of a star wars vibro knife
/me hugs Magical_pablez94
Well he was a happy bloke :P
Invi so far I'm more the space-time theories kind of guy, i read "The Briefest history of time" by stefen hawkins XD
He already offed himself!
Must be his time of the month.
SirGanjalf: Almost the same suicidal mission from Mass Effect 2?
and now the movie dives off the deep end
lol
/me hugs CrazyCherry back
Well, they have all the oxygen they need.
00,10wow way to pass the buck
damn
O_o
kill him too!
Slyphoenix: Didn't played it yet, so no more spoilers, please:)
/me kisses Magical_pablez94 on the cheek
and then kill her cuz she didnt vote!
AIDS
Lil_B I wanted to read that too, my father has the book. but I am reading ''the universe in a nutshell'' atm ^^
Chicks dont give a fuck
i gues they where thinking "why hes calling us how he killed him"
and this is why you need a psychologist on board
i like blood (slurp)
way to waste oxygen
jk
Invi it'
Wait, the guy who brought up diverting the mission is blaming it on the guy who didn't want anything to do with the choice? What a jerk.
1,3lol
00,10DSNesmith they had one
DSNesmith: exactly.
SirGandalf: I didn't say any major spoilers... :S
yeah, I know
he was cool
00,10He was the guy with the shades
/me blushes and kisses CrazyCherry back

Damn did Sunshine start already? I thought it will be another 1 hour...
suddenly, Dead Space
twilight_sprinkler chemistry is close enough to physics to be intresting ^^
yeah, nearly over, Giger4444
Wrek: I have to watch this movie again... so i can understand whats going on XD
What are we watching?
Invi i hope i can study it afterwards
I thought they were doing princess bride first or I would have been here sooner
:'(
05hehe
Giger4444: No it was gone already over an hour
Invi: i agree its interesting, its just too much to memorize for me
05but yeah fantastic music, fantastic visuals, fantastic story up untill mr vaselin
i am bord :P
who was on board?
Ohfuck
Wrek: :D
ded?
00,10makes no damn sence to have no manual mode to rase and lower somthing like the main computer
i call him beef mcbacon
there is a manual mode
twilight_sprinkler <3 chemistry is like programming the real world ^^
he's doing it right now
the human torch vs coolant
Invi: O_o thats an interesting comparison
reddawn: lol
Like not having a remote detonator for Sector 0 in Other M?
00,10yeah makes less sence to require you to be in the tank to manualy move it
Damn exceeded budgets
:D
i like how they make us hear that the liquid is cold as fuck
"um, mr. director, um, I think there's a problem with the film equipment"
what the fudge is this?
Yeah, I thought movie A would start at 8 CEST and movie B at 10 CEST

00,10how do you rase it if the tower is in the way?
"our camera's picking up some static"
so whos the creepy guy?
CrazyCherry: I don't really play at the moment. Sorry. :$
Great job there.:|
"no it's fine, we'll just say it's intentional"
which one of their crew?
now he has it dumby
Vaseline overload
some sort of religious nut
Ha, she got him!
...stop with the silly effect already :(
05the creepy guy apparently survived 7 years on the other ship
captain from the first ship, it should be obvious, since they saif it
00,03Its a mad house here!
GilDash: Still add yourself in there....
why the camera does that each time mr crispy shows up?
awesome music and great movie. I havent seen it in ages.

Hey FillyFlam :P
mace ;_;
hai FillyFlam
why i am still here?
Invi i would love to be able to write computer programms, i think i even have enough spare time to learn it, but i don't thrust these online tutorials, i need a humon to teaches me it, and i will only be able to find such a curse in a bigger city
Yup, its that time to play.
TF2.
I love what they say throughout the movie "We are nothing, but stardust."
00,10cause wrek only kicked you, I am sure the next will be a ban
FlareChaser|TF2: Have fun :D
AW hell
Lil_B i found a good tutorial for C++ on the internet ^^
RaveBrony: Alright, you too! :D
Giger4444: we should watch that movie
Its also an "astounding fact" according to Neil deGrasse
00,10swing for the fences
death by cold water
FlareChaser|TF2: I shall!
carl sagan always said: "we are star stuff"
is that a tuning fork?
RustyMeat: death by coolant
hypothermia
yes, fun fact, you are the product of thousands of dead suns
So what's even going on in this film right now
pickle fork
Lil_B oh, actually, it is only C
D:
05he's tryign to get the mainframe back in its coolat
I got distracted by otakon's racism and lack of geography knowledge.
ouch
Meanwhile: the mission has gone belly up
05the physicist is lockedi nthe airlock
Go to Sun. Die of hypothermia
lol
ouch
His leg is stuck now
Lil_B and it's in german :(
ouch
05all are hunted by MR vaselin who was the captain fo the icarus 1
05Meanwhile
the whole MR Vaselin thing ruins the movie
I see. Thanks Wrek.
Mr. Vaselin
yes, vaseline-man was where it all went downhill
Love the Kenny suit :D
00,10hell of a torch
DSNesmith: he went nuts
o.o
yeah. bacon man kinda fucks the plausibility
so its Fischer jr. vs Lord Vaselin
oh shit
it's not so bad is it the relidous theme that takes over the movie
*religious
time to blow that thing up
Invi yes, but i think another thing is I'm too lazy, I have soo freaking much spare time to learn all the stuff i want, music, programming, physic, chemistry, but without a proper teacher and only plain text tutorial i never gonna make it :(, but thanks for the help
That suit reminds me of a Krogan~
00,10this reminds me of a dr who ep.
do EVA suits have any armour?
yeah, the theme would have worked better if they hadn't introduced it an hour and a half into the movie
Sumica: "BURN WITH ME" ?
Lil_B i know that feel bro /)
Blazang: for me it was the shots of space. It made me feel really small.
it's not really religious though, despite pinbacker's ranting
Insert_cupcake: not really
Invi \)
it's destiny vs. fighting for your future
00,10yes Meanwhile
Sumica: is dr who any good? cant decide if i should start watching or not :/
:3
Invi i kinda messed that brohoof up
Kool_Pony: Yes.
00,10it's good
how dose it become religious? one guy thinking that the sun is ment to die dosnt make is religious
Kool_Pony: yes, yes you should watch it
Kool_Pony: Watch it~
Kool_Pony: good god YES IT IS!
what movie is this?
Kool_Pony: watch it!
Lil_B derp hoof ^^
Sunshine.
well, the ship's all fucked up now
O_o
sunshine
dat body
not my fault
Ladybugs awake
spam to da max :P i shall watch then!
Big daddy?
Giger4444 the shots of space we're great and I loved the scenes with the sun. I just wish this film didnt turn into a slasher film at the end with religious overtones
Clap your hooves and do a little shake.
What the hay....:P
DAMN IT I MISSED PRINCESS BRIDE!
I am frozen man.
00,10I was frozen today.
^
reddawn: you are right, but the captain thinks its God's will to extermeniate humanity and he is God's tool to fulfill that prophecy
its not relogious at all lol
:D
hay TheRainbowDash
really liking the camera perspectives
Actually no
hey Meanwhile i need to ask, did you see wrek's new pic ?
They changed the order, for some reason.
hai TheRainbowDash
he has perrty eyes
the direction in this movie is fantastic everywhere EXCEPT vaseline boy
He has handled being frozen before ::p
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Lapdance edition? Yeah I saw it.
>Thinks its god will to kill everyone
anyone seen Moon?
>not religious
dat music
i love moon
pick one
Hello there Michael and VioletGreySha! (waves and hugs both of you) How are you both today?:)
Skyyyyyyyyyyy
lapdance ?
best scene in the movie
moin TheRainbowDash ^^
Colder: Is that the one where there's one guy working the moonbase thing?
TheRainbowDash: nice :D
TheRainbowDash: iam ok and you? *hugs back*
05re-queue of the second best track in the OSTR
This music sounds familiar.
Meanwhile: Yeah
not sure if the same pic so
I liked Moon.
and all they wanted to was help
payload is free
Meanwhile: Yeah! It's really one of my favorites sci-fi films.
00,03No dari! I liked it!
Hello there Invi! And I am doing just fine VioletGreySha, thanks for asking me back.:)
i'll link you anyway http://i.imgur.com/rXXwp.jpg
00,10epic piano is epic
Moral of the story:dont stop to help others stranded in space
Where's this music from? Is it really an OST? I recognize is to well.
does the Blueteam have to stop the payload?
Well, religion is nothing more than man trying to connect with God on man's own terms. So surely, in this scenario, God smiles on the crew and NOT on the only one who mentions God.
Moon got how to make space feel lonely
they didn't stop to help them
I can literally sing along.
00,03NO DARI I LOVE YOU!
epic strings is epic
05sumica i asume you will play all credists?
Yeah I saw that too.
TheRainbowDash: ofc ^-^ :)
fail
00,10dont I always wrek
Hai Brocoli, I mean bronies
Religion is mankinds search for reason

Man, I watched Cube when i was a kid
05but its larger big
Lil_B: heat shield
He just takes a belief in predestination too far. Making a change for the worse believing that everything that goes wrong is inevitable. That IS the Westboro Butthurt Cult in a nutshell.
05rather*
RaveBrony: i think it was about some guys who found some crazy sphere unter water
nice ost
what tings?
I think there was a Cube 3, but I never botheres with it. After the crapfest that was Cube 2, I gave up.

Scoot-Scootaloo, I would like to apologise for your imagination leading you to believe that I somehow cheated on you.

hentai......
This is like...THA FUUUUUUk

*gonna
04So...

Any reason why both of these characters have almost no clothing on?
04What is this?
0,14iirc, this leads into the actualy anime series?
Note to self, never click any links in here.
Sumica, but evil brings balance to the world?
??
two babes with swords... anything else you need?
is there any context to the random fight scene
dafaq is going on
A film. I think
I would rather watch Eat a Dick than the Wanky Shit Demon
otakon: this is black rock shooter
ded
lol
04Ah
Super stab
Sliced
is this the next movie
04Okay
wat
and then everybody died
04So it's an anime
The dead one looks like a really advanced version of the chick from My Life as a Teenage Robot.
00,10Sorry I am already evil, dont have room for more.
04Cheeky
so THIS is black rock shooter?
Ghosties: Give it a chance :P
girls fighting with swords in bikini. yep, its anime
LunaTheBeloved: But Eat a Dick is both hilarious and useful.

Ok. This will be my first animme.
otakon: When isn't it laggy for you?
brb
=o
daaaaawwww
Doc knocker.
ZetaMetroidBrony: anime tends to make sense when you're through the story. Context is important.
Sumica, well, I'm chaotic neutral to be more specific.
This is a movie called Sunshine...
I wish i could be that happy in the mornings...
This is Blackrock Shooter (I think) one of the movies
Ponyville.
I thought Black Rock Shooter would be a foreign cowboy movie
SLING MOTHEREFFIN STANCE
Doc knocker.
Kandarihu, I beleive you mena context is EVERYTHING
0,14To everyone asking
OH GOD THE HELL WAS THAT!?
0,14this is Black Rock Shooter

I feel like just leaving after that video...
Ok.

i just realized that...
/me hugs the fuck out of Bjornfot
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: you do NOT want to know

So Black Rock Shooter is a slice of life anime?
Well, my internet's FUBAR it seems. :D

0,14>.>
Well, Japanese school years start in April iirc

Don't forget about the Cocktapede

It wasn't terrifying like the other one was.
PONY: You mean you do it on purpose. Poor kitten. :'(

I'll be back later.
Golakka: Something fucking awesome
oh dear this is the worst thing ive ever seen rabble rabble rabble

04Oh yeah, I remember you were working on that novel fangame. How's it coming along?
If you knew, why'd you ask.
RABBLE RABBLE, rrabble rabble RABBLEE!
GilDash, accidents happen, but it would be worse to waste the oportunity by simply dismissing the body.
I belive its used for fighting oil fires, ive seen similar setups on tanks
This sounds dodgey.
Take it in forget you are late
Well, it seems that dari has corrupted us all.

otakon, Dat pun
Imma go play TF2
... How is this not flagged from youtube?
Golakka: more like the Hulk of leaf blowers
AlienWarhead: it's called an R rated opening. A story that starts normal and eventually gets violent will start with violence to warn the way that things are gonna get rough.
ScootaChicken: I'm serious when I have to be. :P
BINGO!
IS SHE LESBO OR WAT THA FUCK
Dat moth

08,01if any of you are in the UK, and are interested in rearing beautiful moths and butterflies, pm me and I can give you some links to where you can get them
:3
08,01and some tips on how
Aegis3423: it happens at times
00,10very dot hack feel so far
PonySwagg: I'm here in spirit. I'm entertaining right now. ;)
otakon: Explain to me the practicality of her wearning almost nothing to a battle
How do you even prepare that hair style, I wonder
Or so I think
Angel_Umbreon why do you liek Hchi Kochi?
lolwat
totally want to see .hack//sign
1,11Damn. Serious mecha.
08,01Meanwhile: not much, actually
He may have just wandered in I dunno
the HELL was that?
SunderlandPony89: magic
GilDash: Ah, there you are. ^^
bugs freak me out :$
GilDash entertaining in what way ;)
Then I'll manage.
00,10I have them flutter_spin
08,01but i do know a bit about them
SunderlandPony89: mobility
04You're...pretty good! *hand gestures*
'bout as goood as an answer as we're gonna get RX-78-SweetieBot
PrincessLuna sighted.
heh. Maybe another time.
didn't see the start. what did I miss so far?
Social link GO
otakon: Um....a robotic catgirl with giant Freezing-style gauntlets?
This anime is pretty cute..
I haven't seen them in a LONG time
1,11Spandex Shorts. Molestia approves.
SunderlandPony89: that and nothing for the enemy to grab onto to hold you still
PonySwagg: :O
otakon: Why no clothes though?
lol
I think they were on Toonami? or Cartoon Network? for awhile
Irish_Pony|Blind: Oh you know, the usual. ;)
I am skipping too much.
CriticKitten: and the robot tail
i wonder if it is forbidden to show over knee length skirts in anime oO
and i am back from slaughtering hellspawns
PonySwagg you have permission to sink!
Lessbian.
too much Pinkie
PONY: StreamViewer has a question or two to asky you about me. :)
PonySwagg: clear you cache, refresh
dat yuri
04Too much moe
diablo 3 is so good
otakon: That was covered by "robotic catgirl"
04Too
It's like a movie version of Persona
04Much
This. Is. Cute.
04Moe
... Because that's how people usually act together.
At least in episode 9 of Aquarion EVOL they actually had a magic that made it so less clothes = better dodging
CriticKitten: oh
GilDash, what's the question?
BlackRock Shooter comes from the Personal design of one person made for Miku, which became a "side character" of Miku with her own personality. And...here we are. EFFORT
it's FOOTBALL
PonySwagg: very cute >.<
Soccer?
Ghosties: NEVER TOO MUCH MOE!
lol
I believe the genre is shoujo-ai, could be wrong.
GilDash Be sure to..."entertain" me later ;)
vollyball
and at the end of the episode they said to never use it again
LunaTheBeloved: i think i forgot to ttell you that i put up a new chapter
>Become naked
needs more explosions!
SunderlandPony89: no idea
>INVINCIBLE
I can't stand the cuteness
PONY: Explain to him who I am. :)
12Its a good anime dood
00,10it's time to dual
I agree with Ghosties
I'm going to start having trouble telling the girls apart. They all have black hair in fairly ordinary styles, except for the goth chick here.
0,14I can finally sit down
dat hair
God I hate everything in a very passive way right now.
Dat scythe
Irish_Pony|Blind ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?
Oh how I love the eyes...
0,14and not worry about doing other things
1,11I hate anime.
otakon: And that MASSIVE cape. Pretty easy to grab hold of that
Ghosties lol now ya got me imagining Travis from NMH lookin at us saying "...moe!" lol
Irish_Pony|Blind: Perhaps not tonight... Depends how long my entertainment lasts. :)
i dont get why she have to wear bikinis lol
Just got on, how far in are we?
so, I'm guessing she's Death?
Silverscreen: you do? :(
PONY not in the way you think...;)
oh well typical anime
Her eyes are wifi symbols!
04Not just Travis, but what's herf face too
OH COME ON!
Herf face.
DAMN YOU BUFFER!
huh, I didn't know Skullgirls had a show.
1,11Yep. Not because it's bad or anything, but because the moment you miss one episode or one scene, you're completely f*cking lost on the entire story.
otakon: You missed the dual :P
Meanwhile, don't you hate everything already?
otakon is buffering forever.
Crippler: it does????????
0,14Shinobu, Ghosties?
what anime/movie is this ?
04Yes
ITS A CHARACTER DESIGN FUCKING DEAL WITH IT
lol totally Silverscreen

Ghosties Sylvia Crystal?
Silverscreen: Watch Nichijou :P
I know that feel Silverscreen
0,14black rock shooter
Meanwhile: Besides Trixie of course
Yeah but usually only in jestful manner.
Silverscreen: That just makes it easier to mock.
Silverscreen: hehe i know you what you mean ^^
hows it going?
Oh, Silverscreen. I know what you're talking about.
00,10this is realy bouncing back and forth too much
Or because I just dislike whatever the topic is.
GilDash well ill just save this whiskey for later then ;)
no...., but that chick sorta...nevermind
otakon: BUT IT'S OBVIOUS FANSERVICE
needs more pacing .. heh heh
It's pretty much my second job, mocking anime when I don't get what's going on. :P
SunderlandPony89: SHE'S GOT NO TITS OR ASS.
Irish_Pony|Blind: Ring Spitfire up as well. ;)
SunderlandPony89: this really isnt very fanservice-y
/me owns both No More Heroes games
Back
#fluttershy
dat sky
I like rain, and I like snow. And I like walking in both. I like chocolate. I like the colours pink and blue. I like a bunch of stuff. But right now I just kinda loath everything.
Oh man.
otakon: And thank GOD for that!
GilDash god i love being Irish....
I'm getting a Kingdom Hearts vibe now
04So
...FITE
04Is this like
0,14hoodie cape is best cape
I STILL don't know what's going on.
kirzstryfe: Was it you who asked for some colours the other day?
1,11DBZ, Pokemon, Yu-ghi-oh, Full Metal Alchemist, ect. I tried watching each of them. Missed or lost one episode and I couldn't understand anything anymore.
The eye :P
Irish_Pony|Blind: I love being me. :D
04a parellel dimension with moe driven ACTION BABE versions of the real girls?
lul
Dis music. So creative. One key being repeatedly tapped over and over.
hey GilDash hows your day been
Ghosties is the PS3 ver good? i have the Wii ver but i was wonderin.
alexxm: Not too bad. :)
Silverscreen: you're shitting me, FMA lost you on ONE ep? that's sad man.
a concrete pit is her favorite place?!?
0,14why does she have a robo voice?
yes
GUYS, this is a B Movie. Made by fans, for fans. Of course the quality has some flaws. :P
!touhou
Ghosties: from the looks of things
damn it every time you think its going to get good they cut back to these guys ...
You know what anime is good? Cowboy bebop...awesome series
04I like the PS3 version for sure
Well, Pokemon tends to be very episodic. You must've missed a rare important episode.
DBZ you don't really miss much but others have that effect on me as well
hmmm
lol reddawn
04It's got extra stuff in it
I never paid much attention the first time I saw this so I dont know either
1,11The only show I could follow was Naruto, and that's because 75% of it was filler. :/
We need to watch a Detah Note movie special here, the dub is good or ok, and there are alot of pony pardories of Death Note
Ghosties: You play PS3? NO WAY! :)
Not only that, it was mafe off of a joke from the Vocaloid fandom...
Silverscreen: Want Suggestions?
try gurren lagann Silverscreen
Silverscreen: you should never watch ONe Piece then, miss one ep and you'll be lost
PrincessLuna: I want to see that. :)
Ok, cowboy bebop and Naruto xD
Ghosties huh cool i might pick it up when i can. :)
DBZ = filler all the time
Cowboy Bebop is one of the few Japanese shows I can tolerate.
...Awww
Naruto....*shudder*
GilDash: It's a fantastic series
Silverscreen: Cowboy Bebop for sure.
04I think it's about 40 dollars right now
PrincessLuna: NO
PrincessLuna: Maybe I'll surf the net sometime for it.
Hey, Naruto is awesome
You could follow Naruto Silverscreen? I missed one ep and I had no idea wtf happened
why do i get the feeling they are going to make out soon?
0,14the singer is familiar
DO NOT WATCH NGE!
GilDash, I think I can't do this, I lost my focus when I started gettin PMs
too much cute
0,14forgot the name
otakon: :(
Sorry my Skype tool bars crashed...again...
tee hee
Unless you want to be depressed into oblivion
My cellphone doesn't have straps either.
PrincessLuna: You could pay full attention to NGE and still be forgiven for having no clue what the flying buck happened.
05nightmare mode?
PrincessLuna: that's a show for the mentally disturbed.
PONY: From whoever I told you? :D
05not convinced yet
what is nge?
FINALLY
GilDash, yes.
suddenly fight scene
/me blinks "Creepy where it froze"
Okay, the FUCK is going on?
lol
Is this the first time BronyState had anime on?
Rawrfite
nooooooo
lol
I loved the episodes and the movies
nooooo
random fight scenes -.-
PONY: Well, I'm busy with other matters. ;)
04No
05they still die fast and without a fight
0,14eeeenope, AlienWarhead
Yesterday, I proposed watching NGE as brainbleach from The Wall.
04We've had Miyazaki on here before
whooooo want's a crazy montage!??
Wrek! glad your here i was wondering if i could ask you something....
ANIME, EXPLAIN DAMMIT!
GilDash: I bet I can guess what THOSE are
1,11AlienWarhead: Oh, hell no.
04And I definitely count that as anime
Miyazaki week.
Its like watching two totally different animes one after another
That was fun.
WHY DOES THE ANIME NOT EXPLAIN ITSELF!?
0,14yeo
13fff
1,11We've had anime on here since it started.
00,10well it is anime Ghosties
13so much cute
0,14first time I've ever seen Miyazaki films
It's hard to maintain dual story based on fan fiction to understand what is happening :p
13I always feel so warm and happy after watching it ;w;
04Dat :3 face
Vordox: wait..........what?
GIMME XD
PonySwagg: You've got no idea. It's hard to entertain this many ponies.
KITTYFAEC. :3
i dont want school i want 2 chicks fighing in skimpy outfits
What was that weird one you showed awhile back? Dubstopper? can't remember the name of it
No!!! More school!
04Your face when
04I actually prefer
In the dark world. One of the girls who was fighting has the same hairstyle as Yomi. That's significant.
1,11Thanks for the suggestions. :) It doesn't help that most animes follow their own form of logic and universe and requires full understanding of both to follow along. The closest thing to an anime I could follow the whole way through was Avatar, TLA.
xD
Anyway I'm going to shower then see if walmart has any boxes, so I'll be back later
Look, it's anime Spike!
04Laid back anime like this somewhat
what a nice kid
okay, so they're BFFs or something.
00,10Not gonna lie, other then looking nice I am lost as hell with this one
oh wow, they are going through all the regular episodes a slice of life has in a montoge
04I'd rather have this over ACTION BABES
Avatar ruled
1,11Ghosties, I can tell why.
Sumica: same here
00,10And I am the one that is supposed to like anime here
PrincessLuna: See you later! :)
Nope
montage*
04Since, you know, action has been done before and it's been done very well
Sumica: same friggin here...
ATLA was like, the best thing that western animation ever produced.
I like anime in general, but this has me lost in a daze.
and its ov.... wait
bye PrincessLuna TAKE A ANTIDEPRESSANT!
@Sumica, anime is the next best thing after ponies
Ghosties: you like laid back anime? well what about sad anime
Oh, it's robo-catgirl again!
13isn't black rock shooter a vocaloid?
04I like "dramatic" anime
otakon: :'(
Sumica well i never able to follow anime...unless its a movie :P
So confused.
NEEDS MOAR ROBO-CATGIRL.
who r yuki.
Shizuka: I think so
Dual story guys :P Keep it up, it's connected.
Silverscreen: Avatar is western
no, black rock shooter isn't a vocaloid
04And most times "dramatic" anime has action in it
1,3the 2 storylines makes it a little hard to follow, but it comes together near the end
It's like one of those "Final punch lines" things.
Walk it off
13I don't know :B
Black Rock Shooter came out of Vocaloid, so somewhat.
0,14I thiiiink so, Shizuka
PrincessLuna: you like NGE, you clearly are suffering from issues
is that the coach?
@Irish, try watching "Sword of the Stranger"
deal with it!
What kirzstryfe said
dealwithit.jpg
04So stuff like Outlaw Star, Trigun, and the ever best Cowboy Bebop
I hope so kirz
00,10this might call for some specal anime after this
SilverScreen just do what like and try new things when you want to or get bored, btw Avatar is awesome<3
Ghosties, you like laid back anime, have you seen Mushishi?
Sumica: yay!
Ghosties, I should recomend clannad :D
1,11PonySwagg: Indeed. And I was severely pissed at how they butchered it in the Live Action Movie.
otakon: That wasnt the discussion topic :[
hello everyone
Cowboy Bebop is wonderful. :3
Black Rock Shooter is just a character that appeared on a Vocaloid song
Sumica: I have a vote we can watch. :P If I can request a movie XD
CriticKitten: I <3 you
0,14>Kokonoe
ATLA is why I watch Korra
PrincessLuna: I'm only messing with you :P
0,14OH GOD
And so far they haven't gone wrong
0,14OUR GIGANTIC TAGERS ARE NOT SAFE
Bonjour
04I have not seen Mushishi
oH MAN
I KNOW
Cipher: the hell is a tager?
0,14oh hai RAWRity
Hola RAWRity
hiya RAWRity
PrincessLuna oh dont mind otokan...we just all love to rape him ;)
1,3Mushishi was a good one
This anime will have you dropping your jaw. :P Atleast five times.
the coach looks as old as the kids
When watching anime, it helps to not be too obsessed with logic. Just suspend your disbelief or go back to sitcoms.
!pokemon
Nick, you are a Hippowdon.
ACE
.-.
1 hour, you say?
Tagers are....um....well they're....LOOK A DISTRACTION
Is it okay if I request it then, Sumica?
why am i still here...
0,14Tager from Blazblue, oatflake =P
Kandarihu: >sitcoms
13!pokemon
Vordox: I lived through TTGL MOvie 2, I doubt it.
Kandarihu: hehe i know :d you taught me that one :D
Bye guys
>logic
Angel_Umbreon, you are a Heatran.
Suddenly... Nothing
>HA
At a laterd date.
Iron Tager!?
BYE GUYS :)
why does it keeps changing :/
Cipher: IRON TAGER! KICKS ASS!
Real Soviet Damage!?
Bai ACS13123
ACS13123: You're still here because ponies.
00,10you are welcome to sujest but I have somthing in mind already
GilDash, I think i got this.
what was the point in the scene change?
It's funny how Black Rock Shooter was just an character of a vocaloid song, then they made an ova, and then it's own anime
PONY: Got what now?
PonySwagg: what ponies?
This... this is somehow sad.
04Speaking of anime
Oh god, they're lesbians right?
sooo sad
04When I do stream
NOW KISS DAMN IT!
Tager is my best BlazBlue character
TheXIIILightning: Not really
Anyway bye everypony
Not gonna lie, I've been watching like, 2 misn of thsi show and I already hte the art design.
Oh no! Their love has been shattered by being in different classes!
04You all best be prepared for some LAIN
You guys can still hang out after school
WOOOT
GilDash, explaining you... Everything
bye AC.....damn he's gone
1,11DBZ Abridged is best anime :3
Ghosties: YES PLEASE.
Okay. I crossed the line there. I'm sorry.
DAMNIT! Lesbians on screen and my stream fucks up. :(
I don't think they're anything other than best friends atm.
In the vein of pointless suggestions, Stream all of Madoka Magica in a row.
I can smell the sexual tension XD
00,10I am ok with lain
PONY: Whatever do you mean?
Ghosties: LAIN IS MY NUMBER ONE FAV ANIMES.
Cipher Tail lady is always grumpy and does not share her candies :p
did someone say LAIN!!?!?!
Ghost in the Shell works too
Silverscreen: AGREED! Have you seen the new ep yet?
*ANIME
0,14indee, TheGreatAndPowerfulT
:D DBZ abridged
:P :) :( :P
0,14also, Kokonoe need to get playable already
Seriously, LAIN IS AMAZING.
btw, I need to learn how to do those *ding* messages
PONY: See? Ponies.
04It's certainly a "creepy" sort of anime, but it's much more than that
1,11otakon: Oh yeah, it's absolutely hilarious how Goku is slowly snapping Frieza's mind.
Silverscreen: Hahaha, I love that abridged series.
I love DBZ Abridged, we should show the WHOLE series.
!pokemon
1,11And episode 30 is meant to be finished by the end of the month.
Espeon, you are a Tyrogue.
My chat is deeeeeaaaaaaaaad.
Ghosties: Lain is fucking fantastic.
Silverscreen: "How you you function?"
YES! DBZ Abridged!
04I agree, RAWRity
not it's not
Lain toys with your mind with logic and reason. I love it.
Muffin Button!
it's just "mostly" dead
:P
Ghosties: have you seen Ghost Hound?
that mean's it's slightly alive
And that means it's slightly alive.
1,11"...I'm going to drown you. I'm going to drown you like a sack of puppies."
04I've heard of Ghost Hound but never seen it
yes it's dead and you're a zombie otakon
And suddenly an add for canadains want to date me appears.....
XD
Ghosties: It's good too.
6_9
0,14well played
...Yuu, for some reason, has like the quirkiest voice
/me presses muffin button
by the same guy who did Lain.
It's adorable
Oh noes
Homewrecker!
Silverscreen: "Why would you drown puppies?"
yummy
I still find it hilarious that the head writer for Lain also did "Digimon Tamers"
Oh, Mato and Yomi can't hang out together anymore because they are in rival clubs.
PONY: So, did you manage to explain?
Sad :(
1,11"Because I'm evil, you moron!" (I think that's how it goes..)
12!pokemon
Latichu, you are a 12Servine.
04On that note, I definitely plan on streaming some Yume Nikki and .flow
:O
My chest hurts.
Well, they're not supposed to be friends anymore.
GilDash: No one can explain you.
Silverscreen: god I love that show.
oh i c. this show is about friendship
Ghosties , I love you <3
^
Do all Japanese schools force their students to wear skirts?
PonySwagg: Oh, I can think of a few good words. ;)
04Um, okay o.o
Oh sure, no one in here was planning on sleeping for the next 72 hours. Bring on the yandere!
04Thanks hehe
Ghosties, Yume Nikki? Isn't that....?
GilDash: http://aijaa.com/0090710216685
I'm actually surprised I haven't seen anything to keep me interested, even with the battles.
lol, flat face
GilDash: No one but you, of course XD
better have some awesome ending
04Yume Nikki was made by Kikiyama, an anonymous game designer from Japan
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2921/
0,14UBOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
UBOOOOAAAAAAAA
PonySwagg: Oh, I'm sure you can think of a few good words too. :D
1,11My favorite part is when Goku says something stupid, and Frieza doesn't even respond. He just barely moves as if trying to comprehend what Goku said...
Ghosties: So is that what this is called?
0,14ninja'd you GabeMoist :3
04OH SHI
Silverscreen: eeyup
Somebody should stream Bakuman
DA FAQ!
04WE JUST ENTERED MIND FUCK PHASE
WHAT I MISS
the FUCK!?
What just happened in the stream?
What just happened.
lul
GilDash, was that good enough?
flutter_spin: same thing we did
BOOM!
/me flips bronystate's lights on and offf
More ponies :);):D:(:O
dang it
I turn around for 3 seconds
omg! *hugs latichu
okay, the HELL just happened?
And I have yet to grasp why this bit is important or relevant
Ghosties: this looks more like it's all going to start coming together.
A cut happened
1,11Anyone here watch Super Mario Brothers Z?
... did we just swith to Soul Eater out of the blue?
...I just got done eating. WTF is this.
What is going on? ._.
Oh.
Oh...
Meanwhile: I have yet to grasp it either
This bit suddenly makes sense.
did you take some medicine already Meanwhile ?
yuki can maek snow?
/me slaps GabeMoist's hands away
Catfight!
04Stop that!
GilDash: Most of the words I could use to describe you can't be said here.
To a degree.
...This girl is a tank.
PONY: OMFG! :D
04Keep messing with the lights and bad, bad things happen >:I
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/559/ WHO DARED???!!!
awwww yeaaah
Anime is your brain on anime... There's no other way of explaining it.
No.
Suddenly, METAL!
Dat music
Ghosties, what are you talking about?
0,14dat guitar
Nor do I intend to.
/me hugs back
PonySwagg: That is an excellent point, and well made. :D
dEAD MASTER
12:D
00,10more dakka dakka
skulls!!!!!
SUDDENLY GUN
I guess she's about to get... Skullfucked.
Dat ass...
what could POSSIBLY go wrong?
Dat plot.
butt shot
meanwhile x holistic medicine
XD
they dont say much
04We're not in Ponoko's house! Much worse things could happen here! :O
Dat slim plot. :P
PLOT SHOT?
NOTHING
Silly girl, bringing a gun to a swordfight
1,11Nopony? Nopony saw SMBZ?
damn
Actually... Good music
00,10I saw it ages ago Silverscreen
Maybe my chest problem will come back in force and just finish me off in my sleep.
Silverscreen: I did, good stuff
Unless the gun can be a SWORD
never heard of it
Silverscreen: SMBZ?
I really like how it goes from School Girls and Friendship to FIGHTING AND STUFF
OH COME ON!!
Silverscreen: he made a partial ep 9 finally
00,10but then he got slow on the updates so i stoped careing
Okay, I have to ask because it's bugging me.
anotehr cut :/
Silverscreen i saw it :)
i kenw it
Silverscreen I just saw some clips on youtube
:<
Why is that girl's eye on fire?
Anime logic: never bring a gun to a sword fight.
The fighting music sorta sounds like the DOOM2 soundtrack
Meanwhile: Happy thoughts now...
Good flash movies, shame it stopped
Meh, Accel World does the random fights out of nowhere better
1,11Super Mario Brothers Z. A Mario/Sonic crossover with a DBZ format.
OH GODDAMMIT WILL YOU JUST EXPLAIN IT ALREADY ANIME!?
CriticKitten: "power mode" thingie :P
otakon: eenope
Silverscreen: that kicks ASS!
Silverscreen have you seen gurren lagann
The mundane and the action take place in different worlds that are somehow connected.
Silverscreen: That = EPIC
I think we made meanwhile too happy earlier so now hes being extra depressing to make up for it
>.> Silverscreen You mean Super Mario Z?
lol what?
Well.
Today's been fun.
I remember SMBZ years since I saw it
PonySwagg: it's all sprite animation too
She misses her friend~
That blue background makes it hard to read :P
My heart won't let me be happy. Isn't that poetic.
1,3otakon, this is one of those rare ova's that require you to watch most of it before it reveals the point of the story
0,14;__;
inb4 this turns into Master of Martial Hearts
Alraedy seen all of it, amazing artist/Writer really.
Stupid broken failure of an organ.
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2390/ Seems that Twilight got the right idea
/me sighs
Like Asura's Wrath, it's Onepice, Bleach, Naruto and Dragonball all mixed up
See, now I wanna see the rest of this
I have an Imaginary friend
and then makes you want to rewatch it kirz?
03forgot to finish/turn in my Matlab assignment that was due earlier... x.x
kirzstryfe: I've watched it, it's show ONE pertinent plot point.
kirzstryfe: Not all are patient to get engrossed, it's a sad fact.
Vordox: Having your eye on fire is a power mode thingie? Man, I miss the days when it was easy to tell someone had buffed up. Their eyes would light up or their hair got absurdly long and spiky or something, and they just crackled with lightning.
Just fyi, it's not broken and I'm not fatally ill.
lol
tak tak tak tak
It just aches a lot.

Shut up slave!!

See? She misses her friend~

08,01PONY: no no, not amputation, just naturally short legs
Yes, the music is nice
08,01otakon: bonsai apple trees
AMBIGUOUSLY LESBIAN FRIENDS!
Vordox: That way I know it's meant to be badass, rather than just a weird animation choice.
lol
CriticKitten: Like DBZ, One Piece or Naruto? :P
08,01PONY: well, yes
BANZAI!
It's the ambiguously gay duo.
何これ？
08,01someone needs to draw this for me
Her friend won't call her back....
DocSane: XD
uhhh
Vordox: Or Bleach. Don't forget about the anime best known as "DBZ but with swords".
It's thundering near me. GOod thing there's a battery in my laptop
Irish_Pony|Blind: That image... I can make your mind up for you. ;)
CriticKitten: Lost interest in it after Chapter 300 something
Kandarihu: what about your router though?
Lol phone
i cant stand dbz
:<
OOH! I know! If I ever get but in a position where I'm a mod/streamer, I'll stream: Ikki Tousen, Eiken, Master of Martial Hearts, and High School of the Dead
CriticKitten: But it's true, it is. :P
08,01RaveBrony: Wrek's... busy
Blegh
twilight_sprinkler: well taht's you.
Vordox: Lucky you, you didn't have to suffer through the arrancar then.
Yeah. That's going to be a problem if it goes.
1,3because Wrek actually has a life and other stuff to work on
CriticKitten: Not to mention Kenpachi...
Anyone, as much as I've been trolled today, it has been fun.
Kandarihu: does however you're connected to the internet have a batterybackup too?
RAWRity: oh dear god, so much fanservice
So let me get this straight: girl gets best friend, girl disappears... that sum it up?
It has
O RLY
マジです。何のアニメ？
GilDash well tel me...which one is you and which one is Spitfire?
flutter_spin: eeyup
lol ok
:)
Don't be silly. Having a life and ponies are mutually exclusive.
Which is good, seeing as I haven't been in the best mood lately
DocSane: English.^^
:<
What's the anime?
Ow phone, you bit me!
But I'm glad you guys have been there to cheer me up ^_^
Irish_Pony|Blind: Hey, maybe she's both?
DocSane: BlackRock Shooter.
... It says... I have free bacon.
Black Rock Shooter
...by violently trolling me.
CriticKitten: THAT is too much, but 5 fucking seasons of Ikki Tousen is fine?
CriticKitten: that's too much? what about Eiken?
0,14suddenly cool guiat
HOTD was the BEST!! Is there a season 2 anime??

RaveBrony: lol when does he not have you drawing somehting for him?
04Dat music

Never heard of it.
missing?
04Haha, same Saxy
violently?
RaveBrony: not yet
1,11Flutter_Spin: MOre like girl gets best friend, best friend turns "close" friend, "close" friend vanishes.
RAWRity: I was commenting on the one I recognized.
Which just goes to show what an out of touch old fart I've become.
there was no violence
0,14I thought Ikki Tousen was only 4 seasons?
Silverscreen: Had tha tfeeling irl as well, Silver?
I missed the text did anyone catch it?
and then she hurts her knee
kenne: Lol!! Ikr? :D
RAWRity: Awwww D:
Dari's banning was pretty violent.
that only works to prove that you are a masochist i guess
what does that mean? there ARE lesbians?
DETECTIVES.
One Piece is shonen action with epic story to it. Infectious tears too. When anyone cries, you will too.
Detectives? Her mom seems a little too happy for that...
AlienWarhead: Call, Takashi is missing
RAWRity: Haven't seen the other two, but now I know not to. >_>
XD
I never got that vibe
Meh, I just thought it was pretty funny tbh
X - Lie
CriticKitten: Ikki Tousen is HotD with MORE PANTY SHOTS.
:p
otakon thanks
Cole Phelps! LAPD!
The cops?! SHIT! *Hides all stolen alcohol*
RAWRity: screw that panties, give me UPFRONTS!
Let's L.A. Noire this *Buy some Apples*!!!
Use doubt
At least you understand that its jokes unlike some people >_>
04Detective Phelps, LAPD
RAWRity: But does it have breasts that can defy logic and appear to function within the Matrix?
Dem Detectives
and Master of Martial Hearts is what you'd get if you crossed Ikki Tousen with School Days
You're lying
dat face
Lie!
1,11Vordox: It's pretty obvious when you seen/read enough stories like this.
I have no idea what anyone is talking about right now.
A - Doubt
CriticKitten: yes. 5 seasons of them.
03LOL
RAWRity: Wow.
Silverscreen: This is BlackRock Shooter. You'll see soon. :P
RAWRity: don't you EVER dare unleash Eiken here.
Also, hello, world.
RAWRity: That's so sad, that stuff like that exists. XD
...This is sad.
0,14speaking of which, I need to finish season 1 of Ikki Tousen
I mean, really sad.
:'(
04Is it just me
*cough* Frenchakon *cough*
don't tell me this is a sad anime
otakon: of the 4 I mentioned, Eiken's probably the LEAST awful.
Nah
Cops are trying to track an extradimensional entity posing as a little girl, that's what I've got so far.
04Or is the volume getting louder and louder and louder
:'(
It started out fine
She died in a freak dying accident. Those are the worst kinds....
Cipher: heh
10hi

RAWRity: the hell it is, it's the worse!
Ghosties: nope.avi
Ghosties: sounds like it
Ghosties, Uboa is approaching

A certain french person

Octagon!
This is starting to look like Shin Megami Tensei
RAWRity: even gigantic ta-ta's can't save it
04BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
Whoa
04:3
Are the cops gone?
Dat suddenly change in the vertical aspect ratio
: O
because Eiken overall is like, an hour. MoMH is 5 eps, HotD is a full season, and Ikki Tousen is FIVE WHOLE FUCKING SEASONS
I'm still confused
04Suddenly, hellraiser
....
flutter_spin: same here
Lots and lots of chains!
A French penis I should say
0,14BREAK THOSE CHAINS THAT BIND YOU
I hate the trope of the ginormous handheld weapon.

But yeah, the one thing I do regret today was being exposed to Wanky Shit Demon.
Why's her eye on fire?
dun dun dun Sephiroth!
otakon: Soon
this fight is way to anime-ish
There's a french otakon in this movie?!
otakon: learn to actually watch it.
twilight_sprinkler: ...Anime in anime? ZE SHOCK
Imma shoot you nao.
Now I feel like I'm watching combat taken straight out of Rusty Hearts.
00,10slow gun is slow
STOP THAT!
We all regret that ScootaChicken
Vordox: cliche is never good
I am not French dammit!
You what did this all better? Madoka Magica.
Yup.
Rusty Hearts.. I knew I forgot a game
twilight_sprinkler: Don't ever watch Hollywood then
otakon: if you hate this for not explaining things up front, Serial Experiments Lain will BREAK YOU
Black Rock Shooter is fighting the Yomi-haired girl again
OH SHIT SON!
Seriously, how can she see with an eye on fire?
Vordox: i dont
Looks like Chrysailias..
:D
twilight_sprinkler: Good Twi.

lol
and then claws
Her name is Dead Master
00,10and now the bondage

DON'T SPOIL IT KOKONOE!
Um... this ain't good
Oh I see where this is going...
And then this turns mature...
TIME FOR RAPE!
Seen enough hentai to know where that's going.
oh god

lol
Lain started out well enough, and then (Like many things scripted by Chiaki Konaka) it kind of collapsed into tis own bellybutton.
sexy time
03https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/5/17/vj-0WB-SxEKD862Q_2eKhQ2.jpg <- LOL
I was just sAYING HER NAME

Leave the vicinity at once!
10December sex
But don't worry guys, after spamming the awful Fan Service shows, I'll temper it with some good ol' fashioned GTO
So I'm pretty sure that those girls are underage, which makes that scene all the creepier.
03yeah I dunno
otakon X french people
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3387/
no
See?
In anime, everyone is underage
also, Lain is fantastic IMO.
Quirky voice girl is the best.
and I am NOT a penis goddammit
10I'd think after Easter because of Lent and stuff
Even 25 year old girls
SunderlandPony89: thats like saying otakon x otakon
I wish that meme would die
10People giving up sex
CriticKitten: there was nothing sexual going on in this whole movie.
One thing I will never stream: Haruhi.
I dont
RX-78-SweetieBot: I hate you right now
03who would possibly do that
03LOL
;)
Her eyes creep me out..

10Also

RX-78-SweetieBot: I said french people, not french penises

I think this is going under my radar. I just don't find it intriguing for my tastes. Probably is good
CriticKitten: absolutely nothing sexual
03"No having sex unless it's to have a baby"
Dat kick
I AM NOT FRENCH
03so I think that's taken care of? :P
I AM NOT A PENIS
Endless Eight still baffles me.
Everyone here would appreciate it so-o-o-o-o much
it was worth it for the bold
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH GODDAMMIT
And then everything sexual happened
BUT YOU ARE
You're a French penis.

Then nothing. It's over.
That made no goddamn sense.

otakon: yea there will be a series... it will explain ^^
That was weired.
What is this i dont even
I'm also confused by the ending.
oh well another normal anime for me :/
i am disapointed
I think the Black Rock Shooter anime makes more sense

Dunno what you guys mean, I understand just fine.
There was no moral to the story..
8/10
SOMEPONY PLEASE FRIKKIN EXPLAIN

What I've getting is, we watched the 2 halves of the story back to back.
Icy: sup! =D
that's like something you throw out when people have seen 20 episodes of the series
FillyFlam: Dem WTF faces.
Now I wish I actually watched it instead of reading the Coke Pony tumblr
Okay seriously, no clue what the hell just happened and I'm not sure it'd make more sense even if it had been twice as long.
Basically, that "ending" was the middle part.
Otakon you know not of what you speak nothing can top the bullshit that is the Mass effect 3 ending
triple AAA!!!!
Hiya
RAWRity: that is NOT how you end it then
lol
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2579/ HHHHHHHHHHNNNNNNNGGGGGG
AlienWarhead: I witnessed it, at least it explained more then THAT.
otakon: no, you see, we've SEEN the ending. We just didn't KNOW it was the ending.
Dragonball Abridged anyone?
1,11Oh, so they had both sides of the story playing at once. Thanks for clearing that up. I wish the fucking MOVIE CLEARED IT UP!
kirzstryfe: you are the one who requested this. Does the series make more sense of this, or is there something we need explained?
:D
Sumica: no w i have to go looking
1,3I've never seen the series actually
RAWRity: the hell you say.
Silverscreen: It's a movie that doesn't hand-hold is all.
00,108 or so eps iirc
kirzstryfe: Neither have I
RAWRity: the ending is at teh END not in the middle dammit.
RAWRity: It's a movie that doesn't explain a damn thing, is all.
:p
Silverscreen: No offence, but it's not exactly The Count of Monte Cristo in terms of figuring things out.
good music though
aw its over i missed the end
Is it complete or still going onto a 12-13 episode mark?
04Animes exist to give context a reason to exist
So what I miss?
Also, sorry for being offline for so long, I had some freinds over.
04It's a vicious cycle ._.
Not everything should be spelled out for the viewer
man this makes me wanna see A to Z Gaia Memory of Fate now :D
...have you guys gotten out of school yet?
Sketch_Toku_Brony: YES
otakon: Basically, it's like if you took a movie, and cut it off at the middle point. then you put the two halfs and sperse them together.
the entire movie seems like a jumbled up mess
I feel like playing Asura's Wrath suddenly...
Meanwhile: THEN FUCKING EXPLAIN OH GREAT MINDED INDIVIDUAL
I really liked the black rock shooter anime for no reason
Has Wrek streamed any s2 GoT already?
Which makes it a poor movie to be honest. I've gotta say, I've seen better movies in the anime style that didn't leave me as clueless as this. >_>
I don't get it. So did she get stolen or something?
kirzstryfe: It was a nice attempt.
RAWRity: that's not my job dammit, that was just incoherent
All the fighting and whatnot we saw earlier was what happened AFTER she joined together with Black Rock Shooter
Otakon I shouldn't argue, but The Mass Effect 3 ending hurt me worse than any ending I will ever witness in my lifetime
Oh, the movies over? What's next?
otakon: it's non-linear storytelling.
My brain is still working out the details, but it leaves a lot to be desired
Hell, I came in in the last 20 mins and I figured it out.
wow, people in main chat were confused by this movie so much
AlienWarhead: no no no the ending the soul eater was by far the worst!
otakon: Sorry, even if I possessed the knowledge of how to speak on your level, I have an impairment when it comes to explanations.
braveheart was a good film
00,10but wait there is more
RAWRity: then you show that AFTERWARDS. They still didn't explain WHAT that worlsd was, WHY she went there.
Ikr.
Oh, stinger!
MORE PLOT!
YAY normality!
0,14CREDITS SCEEEEEEENE
Meanwhile: fuck off you pretentious prick.
wait what
AlienWarhead, I haven't played ME at all, but the good ending doesn't seem to be so bad, actually.
What is this, a Marvel movie?
OH YEAH
What the fuck.
I forgot her
XD
Ah lighten up otakon, enjoy the pink section.
It's like the Avengers again...
dat hair
I kinda want to watch the series that goes with it now
Meanwhile: don't fucking talk down to me and defend this confusing ass anime.
1,11So, in the end, this movie was just a cliche Love and Fight story that was told "differently" for it to appear "artsy."
Yes?
now everything explodes
I DONT GET IT!
wut?
Well then
0,14I was kinda confused too >.>
Meanwhile: hes right. you do have a habit of talking down to people.
1,3Welcome to Bronystate, you may at times be exposed to stories and movies you may not fully understand unless you pay attention. If you have issue with this, you may refer to Addendum Spiderman.mp4
04I'll tell you what's different: Lain
00,10so yea that was the offical stream.
I GET IT!!!!
Okay, that scene was even more pointless than anything else.
Well that explains everything!!
Ever.
0,14but then Rawrity explained it
Still... weird though
Is it Princess Bride time?
04But I'll also tell you what's AMAZING: Lain
We already watched Princess Bride
i'm in university
Litwick: it's over already
XD
GOD DAMMIT.
0,14and then it made it a ton of sense
So, Mato fused with Black*Rock Shooter in order to save Yomi. And then Yomi was saved.
CriticKitten: It was not pointless.
lol lit
twilight_sprinkler: Totally untrue. Ok maybe a little true, but that's just being blunt.
its just the movie cut in half and the halves interleaved
00,10have a bit of a break whole I set somthing up
Yup, Princess Bride ended
Ghosties: DAMN STRAIGHT
HEY
Oh cool Sumi. =3
CriticKitten: foreshadowin if anything
HEY DERPY
not all the complicated
Alright, lotto time
Yeah, that was my reaction to missing Princess Bride.
In the intermission, Have some VNV
So whats next?
Muffins...
Live ponies again?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTL8NtqGdw4
GETME SOME POPCORN
that*
Iiiiinterrrrrmiiiiissssiiiooonn
Meanwhile: oh well if you say so then it must be true
Vordox: Correction, it was thoroughly pointless unless you plan to watch the anime apparently.
00,10oh you want that while I grab chow? oki
Cipher: who picked that movie?
Mass Effect 3 is the worst ending for me and I know there are other bad endings, it is just the Mass Effect 3 was really very extremely bad in my opinion
CriticKitten: Ever heard of CLiff HAngerS?
Which I can't say I do, now. O.o
twilight_sprinkler: Do you WANT me to talk down to you?
00,10back in a moment
0,14kirz did
ah
that was short.... NOOOOOO
wut?
OH FUUU
:O
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
03http://cheezfailbooking.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/funny-facebook-fails-your-math-is-bad-and-you-should-feel-bad.jpg
Vordox: Yeah, Marvel movies do them. Except they do them better.
>_>
noooo
Oh jesus
lol
BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA
RX-78-SweetieBot: it was confusing, plain and simple. It's like dropping someone at the end of the Harry Potter series.
awwww yeaaahhh
Oh god
FufufufufufuufKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
1,11oh god
AlienWarhead: You are correct, sir. Mass Effect 3 deserved bettar.
YAY
WTFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF!
jubasihdybegfehjbde dghawd
There was never any explanation of how she went missing, only that she went into Black*Rock Shooter's world, and briefly had access to the cellular network.
lol
AWWWWW YEEEEAAAAAAH
pLEASE NO
NUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
I AM NOT PREPARED
:$
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
There may come a day when I decide to watch this when it's up, but it is not this day.
04PREPARE
but it was the begining
FUCK YEAR
I beg you!!
O.o
oh crap
THE BIGGEST TEA PARTY EVER
CriticKitten: Guys, if you mock BlackRock Shooter, you mock Derpy. :P
Ok, what the hell is this?
BEST PLAY EVER
Is it God save us all time?
Nonononononononono
No, not this!
Alright. I'm gone for half an hour
Oh, dear God...

Meanwhile: lets say i do
0,14AND HERE'S WHERE I BAIL
I just get in and this is how you welcome me. :(
Sumica: WHY!? Was confusing us not enough NOW YOU HAVE TO TORTURE US NOW?!
04...oh dear lord

/me runs for his barrel but trips "Ow :("
IS THAT BARNEY?
MLP live
YOU ARE NOT SPIKE
No, Cipher.
twilight_sprinkler: Well I could try, but I don't think I know simple enough words.
Yes more more teletubbies!
so this is what will be shown? :/
RX-78-SweetieBot: that's teh POINT
You bail only after you see Rarity.
DA FUQ?!
if so i better be going
ONLY THEN.
yay
If only to wait for GilDash to come back and be all suggestive and crazy XD
LOL
you don't raise more questions at the end of a movie then you answer
dat child
That's what she said
wait what is this
0,14CriticKitten, my response is Spiderman.mp4
Meanwhile: you already said that. try again
at least she was having fun
It's like a pansy Barney the Dinosaur....
Little girls at a My Little Pony show? THis can't be right.
How to.... what
You know, I'm surprised I didn't see people shouting out "PRETENTIOUS!" at the end of that film to be honest.
hell, they could have done that whole thing in 20 minutes with timeskips
OH NO
lol im gonna listen to some Ninja Sex Party
G3
lol
my god
Cipher: Nope.avi, you HAVE to see Rarity.
didn't we watch this yesterday?
GAAAAAAASP!
NO
RainbowcrashNBurn: So you think this is the best thing in the world then huh?
RAWRity: there were some
Jolly good!
Cipher: It must be seen to be believed.
NOP
anyone knows when will this end?
NNNOOOOOO
nope
Should I unmute this for the full experience?
FIM live is worse StinkomanFan
Since I've seen people throw out that word for damn near everything.
No.
0,14...CriticKitten, ;ping me when that happens
Oh, unmute
Nope.
Only if the movie is entirley alone, but theres a series to go with it if you want more.
that........ is a G3 spike
I think it's fine being muted.
Oh my....
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
No, no it isn't
NOT THIS SHOW!!!! ANYTHING BUT THAT!!!!!!
1,11...
it is
twilight_sprinkler: Eh, I'm a spur of the moment kind of guy, thinking things out only impedes the creativity.
.....
Its horrific
Oh god...
00,10ok I am back
This is worse
Sing it! SING IT!
Its worse than newborn cuties
that actually sounded depretty good from the audience
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
AAAAWWWWWWW
XD
1,11I'm not even listening. :D
/me trots back into the chat, smiling.
ollies outies
So, no what's up for BMN?
Even Rainbow Dash isn't as bad as Rarity in this one. As much as people will scream about RD, Rarity's worse.
XD
So, what did I miss? :)
I take it Blackrock Shooter just ended?
nothing is worse than newborn cuties
Oh my
RX-78-SweetieBot: except we weren't watching the series, so it doesn't matter. If it can't stand on it's own as a stand alone movie then it's just confusing
http://tinyurl.com/dyvwpe2
THANK YOU BUFFER
RX-78-SweetieBot: Live action G3
yep
Ponyville lag!
04Was Spike in the Olympics or something? I don't have the audio on, I'm just watching him flail around

This one hurts me because we get to see all the children having there lives ruined
/me hugs Sumica~
GilDash: How would I know? I just got back myself
My body is not ready

GilDash: I know why you were smileing no need to go further in depth
/me simmers in a pot in the corner
Sure otakon? I wouldn't want to say something and cause you to spontaneously combust.
Wait whut
Oh, thank goodness.
O_O?
Meanwhile: I apologize about calling you a pretencious prick.
Meanwhile: i cant agree with that, you can be creative without being spontaneous. id actually say being spontaneous isnt too creative
stream has been jacked
You should've let it run until Rarity. ;_;
MORE ANIME!?
Zecora is now higher on my Best pony list
...oh oh oh
star child, this can't be good
Om: That's probably for the best. ;)
I wanted to see the screams of terror.
OH IS IT?
Meanwhile: Some sort of distraction when bad things happen
No Sound
Just over The Cakes
What's this now?
more anime ....
0,14No sound atm
ohai guys
Irish_Pony|Blind: I could do with a drink!
twilight_sprinkler: That wasn't an opinion, that's how my mind works. You don't have a say in it.
the_real_pony_1604: the hell you say, star child has done good stuff
GilDash: Of course it is, I said it.

Wrek: Did you already stream any of s2 GoT?
Silverscreen: hehe so you noticed ^^
To be fair, shinji's choices are a huge bitch or a clone of his mom
Irish_Pony|Blind: must be like a nuke
00,10of what wrek?
DAMN!

otakon: Obviously the generals forgot to watch the original series.
Um...

Wrek: freakin' saved.
Most powerful non-nuclear explosive in Eva.

On the count of One. One!
There are plenty more
Wrek, hurray, still a chance for me to catch it here then. ^^

FlareChaser: Not as much as I like stabbing myself in the eye.
/me makes an attempt to hug GilDash. ^^
/me hugs PonySwagg.

Meanwhile actually met Trixie at that show. He was nervous about asking out one of the dancers, but me and emangamer convinced him to go for it
sounds like bulma
Meanwhile: aww you love it! :D
0,14also, is Shinji still Spike Spencer
Meanwhile: zoom in on the bottom left guy

He does make a good pimp...

Meanwhile: thats actually the softer version, you were in it instead of the pole initially
Acleps: Nope. I hope he's feeling alright. :(
twilight_sprinkler: I've seen that one.
dat NERV
This... looks like a movie.
een shoe rents
Meanwhile: ah lol
NERV
Meanwhile ow! what was that for?!
13it is
This doesn' tlook like an episode, really.
My father is a professional asshole
GilDash: Yeah, I was kinda worried for him yesterday
NERV, as in "do you have the NERV to watch this series from start to finish without a break in between?"
Is the stream still broken for you guys?
PonySwagg: it's the rebirth movie
in-sue-rents
Acleps: He wasn't well was he? :(
Not the dubbed version CriticKitten.
>Putting Gendo Ikari in charge
>You all gon Die
oh god
Yes? No?
GilDash: No, not really... :(
I'll stick with the original Japanese.
CriticKitten: I do, and I did. As much as I hate some of the characters
otakon: Thought so. Quality is better.
PonySwagg: eeyup
Acleps: I know I tease like a right bugger, but I do worry a lot too. :(
Isn't rebith the old one or was that End of Evangelion?
This animation looks way too good for a 90s anime
0,14looks like Shinji is...
Is this a remake or something?
NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRR...V.
EggWhite: that was End
Yes, "somehow"
NEEEEEEEEERV
no
/me puts on flight goggles
You will be working for them "somehow"
it has a ISBN!
FINALLY! My stream is working right! :)
0,14NERVous
EggWhite: it goes original series, End of Eva, then the Rebuild movies
GilDash: You wouldn't tease if you didn't care.
GilDash: It's good that someone worries :)
BOOOO
...
...I...uh... WELL Imma bored so FlareChaser is gonna look up colgate pics...
Nnnoooooooooooooo
otakon: The only problem is... nothing's changed. Nothing's really stood out. Shinji's still a whiny little... nnnngh, I don't even wanna say it.
There are too many movies to keep track of.
Cipher, the only thing that keeps you from being slapped is that you're a mod.
waaaaaat
So THIS is Black Rock Shooter, eh? Looks nerdy
wow the geofront
PonySwagg: he is SUPPOSED to be whiny dammit!
DAMMIT! I missed the movies
otakon: Some part of me still thinks Evangelion and everything in it can go die in a fire.
they really went out on the animation budget, so much that they ran out before the end and had to throw whatever shit they had together
THis is Rebirth of Evangelion
0,14Lasharus, that doesn't exempt from anything
oh, hello everypony
hi
13this film does not have asuka
hello
No, but I don't want to get kicked. :P
xD
/me is lost
>Keep moving
lol
But you do Shizu.
>Get there eventually
So this is the original series?
Isn't 3.33 or 4.0 coming out sometime soon?
hi everypony
13but it does have shinji getting his flank handed to him by a d8, so that's cool
0,14also, t my understanding Rebuild is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay more optimistic
Like every piece of dwarven engineering ever.
indeed
PonySwagg: I don't really like it but that's bc it's a huge mindfuck and it's depressing really.
....well guess I can't argue
Well, that was fun.
I think so
Shizuka: it also, thankfully, doesn't have the...hospital...scene
Did the OVA of Black Rock Shooter play or was it the 8 episode series?
PonySwagg, well, it is a deconstruction of the mecha genre. Shinji being the exact opposite of a sympathetic energetic hero is the point.
This film doesn't have talented voice actors Shizuka. I'll prefer the Japanese, cheers. :p
Heeeeellllllllllooooooooooo
04TAKE IT ALL OFF BABY
Dat Ass.
Om, Acleps: Yeah, I guess so. :)
04RAWR
I refuse to believe this.
otakon: Exactly! See what I mean?
04Um, ahem
Cipher: ANYTHING is more optimistic
oh lol
13ditto that Lasharus
04Excuse me >>
i get it now
i wanted to go to japan!
I'm making the diet plan for a fat person who wants to play tennis xD

Most of them are, from what I'm hearing here.
GilDash: Dat bandwidth
And yes... his father is still a homicidal, sociopathic, emotionless robot.
Not all dubs suck. Just many of them.
Sumica, not all of them
/me join PonyRP
Oh I'm not criticising YOU Sumica.

/me cuddles GilDash while still in the barrel
PonySwagg: eeyup

I guess I'll leave the chat open, but I won't probaly be fowllowing it... Can you ping me if pikorar comes here?
Yo mama!
Shizu: Shhhhhh!
It's....A thing!
1,11You mean a Mecha?
what the hell?
do they explain WHY the water is red in this?
to be fair, Im not sure, since the remake movies and the series both start out really similar
we want you to pilot it
If I were Shinji I'd have taken a baseball bat to his face by now.
EVANGELION!
It's not water.
Evas aren't mechas
03well
Oh, the seas?
13otakon: all oceans are red, but also yeah this isn't water
03time to go get ready for the radio show
GilDash: I guess I'll leave the chat open, but I won't probaly be fowllowing it... Can you ping me if pikorar comes here?*
Ah yes Shinji, the guy who won't SHUT THE FUCK UP AABOUT HIS DAD
DocSane: so it IS blood

Well, this is post-tribulation
Wait, is this a remake of the original series?
Acleps: I'll do what I can. :)
Wjat
wat
I TOLD YOU
lol
Shizuka wut duh fuq?
hes just a 12 year old man
13ScootaChicken: yes
This looks way too good to be a 90s anime series.
wth man
GilDash: Sure thing.
Meanwhile: and the start the movie like that?
Irish_Pony|Blind: There's not much room in here... ;)
Ah.
GilDash: Thanks :)
So the seas have become as blood and all that.
13with modern animation capability
13and a slightly
that IS crazy!
13SLIGHTLY
Anime.
13more coherent plot
ScootaChicken: IT's NOT 1990s :P
Pwned
Shizuka: SLIGHTLY!
is this the first episode?
otakon: ... wat
ScootaChicken: this is the first of the Rebuild movies.
God he's an ass.
GilDash thats why i picked the small barrel ;)
Ah.
This is the first remake movie
that IS crazy! And trust me, I know crazy
ah so it is the remake movies

isn't that kid a voice in ghost stories?
00,10only for 1.11 Shizuka then it gets all mid fuckery again in 2.22
b'aaawwww
Basically, trying to retell the entire 26 episode series in a 3 movies.
oh man.... he never has a use for a son....
Irish_Pony|Blind: It's quite... cosy in here... ;)
Man that kid is a pansy.
Really.
0,14brb
-_- What an ass.
Leeeeee
<--- Stop being a pussy, boy!
Meanwhile: hehe i know
GilDash indeed ;)
0,14going to strange Shinji
A giant robot? I DUN WANNA PILOT IIIIIIIT WAAAAAAA
13SCREW PHYSICS, I'M GOD
All I know about Evangelion is that it's really mind fuckery and has giant robots or something.
Well, it is about time I got around to properly watching these....
Meanwhile: well he is but his mom died and his dad abandoned him for 3 years so yeah.
Not random, sadly.
/me begins sipping at Irish_Pony|Blind's whisky.
...:|
Hey everypony
PLOT D???
No moar religious post.
04Didn't Evangelion have that "Congratulations!" ending with the penguin?
They're being attacked by angels, after all.
otakon: woop de fuckin doo. It's a giant goddamn robot and he's like, 15.
Cipher, do you enjoy stranging people?
Get out your violins, folks, he won't stop. Ever.
Ghosties: eeyup.
Ah, is this the newer NGE?
I demand an explaination for these recurring events!
And jeez that voice.
04Haha, nice
Dat Piano
please?
Dude...
0,14I might if they deserve it, GabeMoist
1,11"HEY! Let's take an untested weapon and have it piloted by an unexperienced boy who has emotional and personal issues with one of our most important people in the team"
Just get in the damn mech already. :|
1,3wonder how it knew their location >.>
Seriously.
What an ass.
Shizuka: That caught me off-guard at first.
>EVA
Shinji the biggest bitch in anime EVER
>Mech
Silverscreen: eeyup
04But Silverscreen, he's our only hope!
kirzstryfe: Aliens.
DOHOHO
I'm not dead yet
Silverscreen: brilliant!
dun dun DUUN
00,10kirzstryfe they looked at there mini map
Suddenly, the whole point of making Gurran Laggan is much clearer.
13Second Rule of Evangelion: Shinji is a wuss up through the end of Rebuild 2
You're right kid, no one needs you, now go away.
Shinji, only hero I know who jacked himself off over his comatose girlfriend.
XD
In the end of 3.33 he gets some balls.
Shizuka: How long is that?
Shizuka: hehe :D
Waht is this called.
Boooobs!
I mean, what.
And suddenly Rei is wounded from the beginning
13Third Rule of Evangelion: the motto of this series is "it gets worse", every time
Shizuka: Shinji is ALWAYS a wuss.
Animation is better.
1,3Fourth Rule of Evangelion: Shinji is still going to be a bitch in the end
Bandages...
Wrek stream yesterday was awesome XD
Much better.
Shizuka: and you LIKE this?
00,10hey at lest shizi dosent fap all over auska in this one
1,3lol
13Sumica: yeah but that's cause they dropped a bridge on her :<
God, that smile...
Shizuka that sound's like the rule for Twilight
fap fap fap
Shizuka: Question. Is this a remake following the original story or a new take? Because this is just like the first ep so far to me.
Sparkle
That shit-eating grin
and then there came the fics.
I. Hate. Gendo Ikari.
/me is reminded of Zone of the Enders.
Hey wrek or Sumica , Does the alliance have a webpage yet, or is anyone working on one?
The only part of the franchise where he ISN'T a complete wuss is in the Manga. and even then he's not exactly a strong, independent black woman.
13K_A: Rebuild 1.0 more or less follows the first four ish eps exactly, with some plot elements changed
yeah kid that's blood
its that time of the month
k, wat.
K_A, yes, it follows the original series to a T, at least for this first movie
00,10not so far as i know Golakka
K_A its a remake with some differences but also possibly a sequel of a loop sequence
13for instance, in the original series, EVA01 protects Shinji from falling debris there
Mother of god that kid is so damn whiny.
"there is blood on my hand!"
1,3like the crazy bitch in pink that shows up in rebuild 2?
where do they get so much blood
Meanwhile: eeyup
Want me to rattle one out, not doing anything
XD
I am still here...wating patiently for MLP...ahhhhh
Shizuka, RainbowAsh, RX-78-SweetieBot: OK, cool beans.
Psychological contamination is within the standard range, huh?
Midnight_Tempest: what? your playing L4D2 now?
Breathing liquid. Ick.
goddamn that must be unpleasant
ah yes, LCL
And that means being in the robot messes your head up either way.
Meanwhile you should have been here last night! I was drunk and Wrek was drawing and it was all just a big clusterfuck
13mari better have some kind of payoff in rebuild 3 cause she just makes no sense in 2
Fabulous!
FlareChaser|Colgate: no... testing some mods actually, and sprays
there is a liquid that you can breathe in, I forgrt the name
once again
Sounds like a riot Ryanier128. >_>
Wait. So I bought this pizza for nothing?
>EVA
rebuild is a retelling of the original story, but with some stuff added and/or changed.
>Robot
Midnight_Tempest: Alright, hopefully we can all play later.
Golakka: Really?
lol
Why are you guys breathing me? D:
Is that EDI?
Ill see if i can find it GilDash
Shizuka: something in Eva not paying off later on? parish the thought.
okay guys, brb have to water the plants
Golakka: I'd appreciate it.
0,14I HEARD HIM
no
That reminds me...
They use it for people with incredible burns
0,14I'D RECOGNIZE HIS SEXY VOICE ANYWHERE
Who Cipher ?
00,10but shizu she was the muguffen cause they droped a bridge
spike mech
Yes, there is a liquid that you can breathe, but not for extended periods of time: it destroys your diaphram.
Hey, what film is this?
Vordox: he's saxy
Why did they paint the robot purple?
PREPARE TO FIRE VOLDKA CANNON!
blum is in everything
reddawn: Oh god it is Spike's color scheme.
Aww
Can we get drunk now?
FIRE VODKA CANNON
the only robot in this show is Jet Alone
I want to get Drunk.
A bit darker, though
00,10spike mech is go for launch
And now the mech is Spike. Cannot unsee.
13just cause they were lazy developing toji
/me passes FlareChaser|Colgate whiskey
Meanwhile it was. Scoot-Scootaloo went all raging because everybody was breaking the rules and I was really wishing you were there. I'm guessing nobody told you what Wrek was drawing, right?
Thanks Irish_Pony|Blind
I know its a type of florocarbon GilDash
/me drinks the whiskey.
Toji was going to be so awesome
Golakka: I'll have to have a look myself now.
Ryanier128: Everyone and their goddamn Grandma has told me what he was drawing.
13gendo doesn't have nearly a deep enough voice
ITs got a unicorn horn
13needs to have more of a sinister gravel
then they gimped/killed him
Hey, dude.
13all right kid, don't get cocky
00,10did any one tell the kid how to drive it?
enope
Perfluorohexane GilDash
Nope.
1,3his mom told him how
13LIFT OFF
and I dont think Jet Alone even shows up in the remake movies
And then he fell over.
This seireis has decent music.
Shizuka: >shinji
13walk... W!
>cocky
Of course not, why would he need piloting lessons?
>hospital
lol
Golakka: Cheers. Time to do research!
WASD.
You're dead.
>terrible, terrible things
HE'S DOINT IT!
Fall
Seriously dude.
00,10walk kinda sound like fall on your face right?
fall lol
Called it.
Sumica: he played the pre-released game version of the movie
lool
LOL
Fail
Meanwhile that is totally believable. By the way, Samantha says hi
fail
HUMANITY IS SAVED
so that would mean there are no robots in this
0,14see that idiot walk *guitar riff*
Your bad! and you should feel bad!
You have no idea.
lol damn
I kinda dig the glow-in-the-dark touch.
SNAP
Ryanier128: I don't know who that is, but say hi back for me.
O.o
So... Why are they letting a young, probably around 14 year old boy pilot a giant, dangerous robot?
Oh shit son!
Sheeeet
wtb is this?
Cipher: Atleast you're enjoying yourself XD
lol
fail
Crunch.
Ow.
Its used experimentally to treat people with scorched lungs and servere smoke inhilation GilDash
This music does not fit at ALL

Why does it even have a mouth.
ScootaChicken: Freudian definitely

I'M GOIN BEARSERRRRRRRRRK
Meanwhile: for sucking a mean co....er yea
13it's a space station
Aye GilDash, I love useless tipbits of information :p
HA! There's a community challenge in Impostors for NOT playing the game for a certain amount of time
"We've done it"
He has a mouth because spoilers.
I'm watching this particular iteration the first time, but I loved the original series until it forgot what it was doing.
00,10how else will it nom with out a mouth
13no! not the stop sign!
+
sadly i have no use for it in my fanfic
O.o
I'll get that arm back, thank you.
lol
RainbowAsh: Because it's a robot designed for combat with big ugly things, having the ability to roar is not beneficial.
I had a mouth once, then I took an arrow to the knee
....
In fact, it's a structural failing.
13shogouki laughs at your puny psychological defenses!
Meanwhile: its not a robot
hello everypony

There's a LOT I could be criticising here (the pacing is awkward as hell, dialogue doesn't make sense, the direction is way too close) but the most irritating factor is that god damn MUSIC.
. . .
/me cuddles GilDash harder
OH DAMN!
bloodrayne
kirzstryfe: with us :|
lol kirz
ScootaChicken: The only robot in NGE is Jet Alone, and I dont know if it shows up in these movies
twilight_sprinkler: Litterally...
ScootaChicken: I'm assuming they're all piloted by people.
I like how in the TWO EPISODES that ran on Toonami they cut off all the crosses.
13i'd put in my dvd but more fun to be synced with chat
that mecha is made of chuck norris

13i think they swapped VAs half way through...
Shizuka: so...how many times do they have Shinji go on the train in these movies? I'm guessin 4
O.o
Gah
00,10depends on if any one wants me to stop or not kirzstryfe
O.o
Oh my god wat
GilDash: the enemies are not piloted by anything, they are their own living beings

GabeMoist: too soon
00,10needs more spider man end of eva

I hate glass floors

He's the new kid, and the new kid always has to suffer. INITIATION!
Yay!
13wait not suzuhara that's toji...

I like Shinji. Broken characters are much more worthwhile than almost perfect heroes who only have flaws to overcome them before they have any major bearings on the plot.
Punch him some more.
what a pussy
>Pilot in charge of Humanity's ONLY HOPE
Seeyah faggot
God damn
13forget the other kid's name... but his VA is familiar

Pull da Trigger.

Even she knows Shinji's not supposed to be here.
Lol, they're sitting as if they give no fucks.
PONY: I'd like to see you. :)
TAKE THE SHOT *gulp*
.
I do recall the computer graphics scenes being pretty minimalist, looking as if they were rendered on an oldschool terminal.
bye Sumica!
13this song is good for town music too
NERV our machines are not aesthetically pleasing.
Kipkat07_Mare: GilDash was here before you...and we've been having fun ;)
Something tells me where going to be getting a fair bit of Oedipus Complex-y stuff here.
In the original.
Ooooh "maintenance"
13most of these mellow-er songs are good for oblivion
We need more Boobs.
GilDash, I*m scared to see zou
Shizuka: huh? how does pulling a trigger have less impact then a switch?
13skyrim not as much
indeed, Shizuka
seeya Sumica . . . wait, who's leaving?
13otakon: the line, the japanese is better
That's core-ish enough GilDash.

Om its a fact that on the internet you don't feel as you do like irl
Shizuka: and other reasons
thanks
so if Sumica isn't leaving and SamanthaGirl159 isn't leaving . . . who is?
This explains that video called 'Evangelion in a nutshell' which had two hedgehogs from Winter Wrap Up hugging each other but getting spikes in each other or something.
How did I not notice that with your avatar?
Shizuka: pfft, Shinji x Pen Pen is OTP
SDAT?
Kandarihu: sadly.... ive been hurt too many times ya know?
GilDash: I talk less in real life.

SamanthaGirl159: you asked what happened, I told you.

He isn't a very good converser
13ROLL 1d8
GilDash: Shinji makes too many excuses for himself and everyone else. I'd rather just give her the card. And then I'd tell her HELL NO, he LEFT me. I have ZERO faith in the bastard.
da hell was that? lol
Sumica: because we need places for them to have long, stupidly written discussions
0,14and her gear fresh to death
the hell is that thing?
loz this one
well....there was a single f*** after all
This one is cool.

Probably my favorite angel design.

Seriously, that was DEATH STAR level blast

In soviet russia, cubes harves you
Get a cruise missile.... Or a Nightfury to do it :D

Nah, 19's not enough, and we thought 23 or 24 was just overkill so...
It's an octahedron. Octahedra don't have brains.

....they say that?
killerpony7733: Cuse the epicness would jam it.
all of them
Killerpony7733: they'd raze the city and the HQ under
0,14figured as much
A nuke in a railgun isn't strong enough.
So wait, did they jam all the angels in this movie?
The level of nuking required would also destroy NERV.
snipin a good job mate.

/me pokes PrincessLuna
PONY: what about bakanai?

LUNA!
Is this his bran?
NEVER.
You're still here because the figurines sold well, Shinji.

AHEM, What anime is this.
0,14>things get hard
0,14eheheheh
pointless
Kandarihu: Better be. Otherwise I'm going to just cry... and just ask that they kill Shinji outright. Spare him from the pain.
DOHOHOHOHO
pikorar: eeyup, it's his inner monologue
dohohoho
Evangelion 1.11
/me glomps PrincessLuna and pokes her 100 times "hehe"

/me glomps panda

THIS TRAIN'S A ONE TIME PLACE. We surely will not come back her 5 MORE TIMES for something like this. That'd just be silly.
I give up, g'night everyone
/me hugs panda
Om: not at all
He seems to have a few issues.
GODDAMMIT Wrek BOT!

/me glomps SamanthaGirl159 back
At least nobody's jerking off over your unconscious body, Shinji.
panda: I'm watching you >.>
"Rei....did you masturbate over me?"
You're right, Shinji. This IS all you get when you pilot the EVA.
ding ding ding ding ding ding deeung
otakon... His brain is too bright... It hurts my eyes... I would go with a smooth jungle green for my inner monolougue.
0,14but this is great ;____;
Shes watching him sleep 0_o
Darf14: :O
Have fun Cipher
/me smiles
Not creepy at all O_O
"...Maybe"

Cipher: take your plate and eat while watching you....
RaveBrony: FASTER! FASTER!
beep
And then she's gone.
good old military mission speak
Yummy
Stand by for further penetration
Thanks, Siri. Set an alarm for 20 minutes before the operation.
RAWRity: the levels of disturbing from that would be off the scales
beep
FlareChaser|Colgate: Im coloring your OC now :D
beep
RX-78-SweetieBot: HA. NOT PREPARED.
Of course he is.
K_A: BEEP!
MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Shinji! You're a little bitch! People die! Fuck!
Oh, OK then
00,10man shinji has a heart beat of like 15 per min
That thing is the inside of a madhouse.
FlareChaser|Colgate: Shouuuld be done within the hour, not sure tho
RaveBrony: YES
sllllow
damn
Sumica: he's actually dead
RaveBrony: gogogogogogogogogogogogo
I'll just go die alone. Enjoy your nap.
Wait...Rei operating 01...So Shinji's mom...would be inside Shinji's mom.
YOU DOG.
is that annoying prism thing the Eva?
1,11You know, this is a lot like a Stephen King movie. Everyone except the few mane characters are complete assholes.
*YO
shit
selfcest!
Ikr Silverscreen.
Suddenly ospreys
Silverscreen: eeyup, just like the crew of teh GekkoState
Silverscreen: and even the main characters are assholes.
yo Silver
He's following my advice then... Dying is no excuse to stop being alive, PrincessLuna.
Silverscreen, that is real life
00,10super cunductive ultra high vultage
Pink lighting though? Really? I'd go blind in that crap.
Silverscreen have you ever played the Stephen King Drinking Game?
lol
I find it ironic that everyone's holding Shinji to the standard of the EXACT kind of archetype that this series is meant to deconstruct.
Click click click!
Dear god this looks cool... i mean, MOO!
RAWRity: Momception! But please, no jokes about needing to go deeper. This is Evangelion, I think that joke pretty much makes itself happen.
pikorar: True story :(
SamanthaGirl159: lol, is that from Nostalia Critic?
We have a problem here! We've run out of superlative adjectives!
See this is what fan fiction is for. To give a main character like this something else to hold onto. XD
KABOOM!
Theoreticaly.
That's a big cannon
Gee, it sure does!
Darf14: it is
1,11SamanthaGirl159: Sorta. Not old enough for actual alcohol.
I'm back.
Darf: that's the point
Darf14: You're perception is exemplary :)
THE PIROT NEEDS DISIPRINE!
Kandarihu: some people actually like the archetype this series tries to deconstruct
User0: it's a Positron Cannon
1,11"Made up your own mind"
otakon: eeyup. It is SO much fun! It actually makes watching his movies interesting!
You know if I didn't know that a positron was actually a thing I would think that name was totally stupid.
What, it's up to Misato to bring him around?
1,11He was tricked into it, you bitch.
otakon: I'm well aware.
pikorar: xD
Freudian analogies from heaven Shizuka.... @_@ *wobble*
-_-
HE'S BEEN DRAFTED FFS
RX-78-SweetieBot: good point.
CriticKitten: Yo Shinji, I heard you like your mom, so we put your mom inside your mom and- WHAT IN THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING. SHINJI NO.
Hell, old enough to drive 500 foot tall robot, old enough for a beer
ohai Silverscreen
Evangelion?
Translation: Stop being a bitch Shinji
SamanthaGirl159: you like Nostalgia Critic? It's funny stuff
Is this kid gonna whine again?
WallDives: Yup!
/me glomps WallDives
shrug
Slap him!
rape
ponyshrug
00,10cum with me
At least Shinji's a bit more...
FillyFlam: he tends to do that...a lot
True
lol
Sumica: stop that
offer him sex
SURPRISE BUTTSECKS
dat ticker
Sumica is rather dirty minded
nwo
But 40mm is soo much sexier :p
I will show you
Sumica: :D
/me is glomped
whining is his special talent
Well, he's actually complaining.
They're in the future and that's not digital?
RAWRity: Oh god
00,10love in an elevator
And I suppose that if fans had heeded the deconstruction of this series, the mecha genre would've ended with this.
"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. Fighting to save the earth is so haaaaaard."
I mean seriously, he's COMPLAINING.
Not as devastating as the Black Plague was.
Sumica: thats a song
PrincessLuna: Ah...I haven't really been watching.
Kandarihu: huh? how so?
LE EE, SRS BSNS.
SOOOO MANY FOREVERVATOR SCENES :[
no. He's totally whining.
yay?
locally, we have a meme with Shinji.
deeper deeper way deeper much deepee
EEE
he will thrive
LEEE!
what the
Silverscreen yeah, I know how you feel. I made up a "Mel Brooks Drinking Game" with Ryan when we were teenagers, but we just used Pop Rocks and Coca-Cola instead of alcohol
wow....thats far
What is that?
the FUCK IS ALL THAT!?
Wait, no, I think I got it backwards. 1/3 was lost, not left.
Is that the inside of my brain?
and anyone whose seen it knida knows. "I'm fucked up". that is all.
otakon: Phallic symbol.
For every elevator/escalator scene, take a shot
00,10oh btw we have this in the basment
The elevators apear so much in this anime they should be considered charectors
Maybe they're inside a giant human body.
Oh hai Lilith.
Oh gawg
lithith
wow, that is a early reveal
Ewww
lilith
... :O
.....a turnip?
wow?
otakon he's pretty funny. Ryan got me into the series. So awesome . . .
Lilith? In the TV series, it was named Adam
REDESIGN I SEE!
what the . . . holy shit
YYEGH THOSE EYES
Keel it D:
hey guys, I got something to say!
Did you notice how the area below the abdomen looked?
ahem
holy crap?
00,10btw shinji. No presure or anything.
It's like Shepiroths mother, Genova
no it wasnt adam
hmm....I thought it looked different
I'll say no more.
Kandarihu: no you're thinking of something else
I like cookies.
FlareChaser|Colgate: what is that?
that is all
oh.
00,10but if you fail it's the end of days
They THOUGHT it was Adam.
1,11A destiny you FUCKING MADE FOR HIM, YOU DUMBASS!
Also, cross
Darf14: in the show it does
adam was the thing in the petri dish
For a deity it looks really sad... :(
Kandarihu: there are theories that the rebuild movies are a kind of repeated sequence sequel
