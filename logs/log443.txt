... Because that's how people usually act together.
BlackRock Shooter comes from the Personal design of one person made for Miku, which became a "side character" of Miku with her own personality. And...here we are. EFFORT
it's FOOTBALL
Soccer?
lol
I believe the genre is shoujo-ai, could be wrong.

04I like the PS3 version for sure
hmmm
1,11The only show I could follow was Naruto, and that's because 75% of it was filler. :/
Not only that, it was mafe off of a joke from the Vocaloid fandom...
DBZ = filler all the time
...Awww
Naruto....*shudder*
04I think it's about 40 dollars right now
Hey, Naruto is awesome

No!!! More school!
04Your face when
04I actually prefer
1,11Thanks for the suggestions. :) It doesn't help that most animes follow their own form of logic and universe and requires full understanding of both to follow along. The closest thing to an anime I could follow the whole way through was Avatar, TLA.
xD
Look, it's anime Spike!
04Laid back anime like this somewhat
04I'd rather have this over ACTION BABES
Avatar ruled
1,11Ghosties, I can tell why.
00,10And I am the one that is supposed to like anime here
montage*
04Since, you know, action has been done before and it's been done very well
ATLA was like, the best thing that western animation ever produced.
and its ov.... wait
Oh, it's robo-catgirl again!
04I like "dramatic" anime
NEEDS MOAR ROBO-CATGIRL.
Dual story guys :P Keep it up, it's connected.
04And most times "dramatic" anime has action in it
1,3the 2 storylines makes it a little hard to follow, but it comes together near the end
It's like one of those "Final punch lines" things.
Walk it off

In the vein of pointless suggestions, Stream all of Madoka Magica in a row.
I can smell the sexual tension XD

PONY: Whatever do you mean?
Cipher Tail lady is always grumpy and does not share her candies :p
did someone say LAIN!!?!?!
*ANIME
:D DBZ abridged
:P :) :( :P
Seriously, LAIN IS AMAZING.
PONY: See? Ponies.
04It's certainly a "creepy" sort of anime, but it's much more than that
1,11And episode 30 is meant to be finished by the end of the month.
Espeon, you are a Tyrogue.
YES! DBZ Abridged!
not it's not
:P

Oh, Mato and Yomi can't hang out together anymore because they are in rival clubs.

Unless the gun can be a SWORD
never heard of it
OH COME ON!!
Okay, I have to ask because it's bugging me.
anotehr cut :/

:<
Anime logic: never bring a gun to a sword fight.
The mundane and the action take place in different worlds that are somehow connected.
Well.
Today's been fun.
I remember SMBZ years since I saw it
She misses her friend~

selfcest!
Suddenly ospreys
00,10super cunductive ultra high vultage
lol
I find it ironic that everyone's holding Shinji to the standard of the EXACT kind of archetype that this series is meant to deconstruct.
Click click click!
We have a problem here! We've run out of superlative adjectives!
Looks like a sniper rifle
wheres sniper?
Theoreticaly.
Gee, it sure does!
1,11SamanthaGirl159: Sorta. Not old enough for actual alcohol.
I'm back.
Darf: that's the point
THE PIROT NEEDS DISIPRINE!

dat ticker
nwo
But 40mm is soo much sexier :p
/me is glomped
whining is his special talent
Well, he's actually complaining.
And I suppose that if fans had heeded the deconstruction of this series, the mecha genre would've ended with this.
I mean seriously, he's COMPLAINING.
LE EE, SRS BSNS.
no. He's totally whining.
locally, we have a meme with Shinji.
deeper deeper way deeper much deepee
EEE
LEEE!
wow....thats far
the FUCK IS ALL THAT!?
Wait, no, I think I got it backwards. 1/3 was lost, not left.
Is that the inside of my brain?
and anyone whose seen it knida knows. "I'm fucked up". that is all.
1,11Yeah, but everyone in the organization IS FUCKIGN TRAINED FOR IT!
For every elevator/escalator scene, take a shot
Oh gawg
