13so... earlier before i left... vivi had mentioned one of the best german bands ever, In Extremo
13und i have had this song stuck in my head since <3 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgneUsb6FOI
Oh? :o
My father used to like some german band called UFO
I know of them.
I love In Extremo
IDK what happened to them
Never listened to em though
13perhaps appropriately the only two songs we heard from them during my german class were Kuss Mich und Nur Ihr Allein ~<3
In Extremo where in the first Gothic game, one of my favourite games ever
13but soooo good songs <3
and then my chat derped
brb
And searching "UFO" on youtube is like opening a box with thousands to tiny other boxes
with even more boxes inside each
No new pony icons
Not big suprise
While you're at it you may take a look at "Samsas Traum"
As long as we're talking Euromusic how about that one song "All This Love"
By Simalou?
the one with Rainbow Stalin?
Rainbow Styling.
Yes, that one
Chat go boop?
chat is dead.
Surprise big not.

Shizuka, where you doing this? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHK0uFb6Vzw
/me agrees with truce, noms on LawnchairRawket as a sign of peace
Hey, what the-
What was that for?
Also, Shizuka , why are you covered in flour?
11,14you're the victim of the first name I saw <3
/me assumes kitty form

ScootaChicken: dafaq?
11,01
Phase4, it's how I make bread
"Unlessï»¿ you can think of a better way, I'll continue to make bread like this, thank you very much."
xD
meow
I shy with my little eye.
Alright, hopefully the intellectuals in the Twilight Sparkle room will give me some advice
11,14where?
13someone covered me in flour .-.
I need a fanfiction idea
/me purrs
mew
13und now es ist everywhere .-.
Shizuka: Ready the cannon?
/me 11,01throws water on Shizuka
13i was just trying to play Nur Ihr Allein in audiosurf und suddenly PAF flour everywhere
ohai there
11,14any particular genre you like to write?
pony_7661: you must have some ideas
/me purrs and rubs agaisnt LadyCanary
11,14lol
And now Shizuka is sticky.
Oh dear.
I want to write a Conversion Bureau fic, but my first one was a FAILURE
dat batter
/me pets IshBestKitty
:)
11,14I've seen the series around, but haven't had a chance to read any
/me *whistles*
/me purr purr purr
11,14did it not get through or writers' block?
o.o
/me noms Nyria
I finished it but nopony liked it
/me is nom'd~
Paper Shizuka is now Ghost Paper Shizuka? o.o (cuz flour = ghost *sagenod*)
/me noms Nyria's toe
I need something better than a simple 'prisoner breaks out' story.
Oh that tickles~
0,5EVERYONE NOM MYRIA
/me sticks a phoenix feather on Shizuka
/me noms LordCelestia's bacon mane
Hopefully with as little dialogue possible
But why?
11,14dialogue tends to drive the story, hard to do one without it
http://youtu.be/8gXk8y7_qxY so much nostalgia
11,14I can give you the advise my mom used to pound into my head whenever I had to write something
/me bounces along to the theme
I'm excellent with visuals but dialogue is just a huge stinky pile of horse apples
mew
11,14answer the 5 "w"'s: who, what, when, where, why
/me just learned an interesting fact about bacon.
Do tell
:)
Tell us now~!
I can't make dialogue that doesn't sound like something out of a bad Point-n-click adventure game
0,14Apparently
0,14it can stop nosebleeds
Hey shizu
11,14I can offer to help with editing and working out the dialogue within the story if you'd like
/me pokes dead chat
...How?
It can?~
0,5Excellent!
cant seem to find an episode but http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gt2qtlrXWp0 is part of one
0,5=====================================
how can bacon stop a nose bleed?
Bacon!!
meow
0,14http://gizmodo.com/5879292/shove-a-bacon-tampon-up-your-nose-and-it-will-stop-bleeding
What if we got nose bleeds from bacon?~
I come back to chat and bacon tampons.
wat.
Thanks, but I still don't know what to write it about, It's like I have tons of ideas but none of them are worth fleshing out...
11,14I've always been a fan of sci-fi/fantasy stories, stuff that sets up its own world
0,14>.>
You learn something new everyday!
3lolol Saxy
...
why are we talking about bacon tampons
/me hopes that artical is a joke
11,14^
0,5What is this i dont even
11,01Dari's bot needs to be debugged.
0,5-_-
why is LordCelestia's hair tampons
0,5My bacon is NOT MEANT FOR THIS
even baconmane dont get it
Nittany_Discord: why?
meow
/me is lurking
/me pet IshBestKitty
11,01It should be posting titles, not URLs.
I'm going to go to sleep goodnight everypony~
Night Nyria
Indeed
11,14nope
Nittany_Discord: that was changed after debugging
11,14he did that on purpose
night Nyria
And night Nyria
/me comes back clicks link, suddenly bacon tampons.
does anypony know where my store will be hiding the blind bags when they carry them? Will they be with the normal merch stuff?
11,01K
/me purrs and rubs against Phase4
11,14to stop the no-title issues
11,01Well, EqD did make no-title posts.
btw, eqd's rss feed. anyone got a link?
11,14no idea emangamer, the ones near me haven't gotten them yet
If you check the EQD source it's there.
11,14but I would guess either on a clip strip in the aisles or a box near the trading card section
11,01Speaking of that, I made a tumblr account today. Would you like an Ask Nittany Discord?
kirzstryfe: I have heard in the trading card section from some ponies
Nittany_Discord: you should follow me
Phase4: http://www.equestriadaily.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss
11,14I've seen the knock-off pony blindbags in that section, so I'd assume that's where the real ones would end up
If I could draw I would make a tumblr
meow
kirzstryfe: knockoff blindbags?
11,01Or Ask Cold Front (another OC).
but drawing makes my brain hurt...
11,01I don't draw, but I can.
What's this about blindbags now?
watch my store have blind bags and me not even know
11,01If enough people want it, I'll draw.
/me I Can haz Cheezeburger
That's it! A western! As a child people tend to want to be one or two things: a space man or a cowboy! If I can just take a curmudgeny old punk with no respect for his fellow man, put him into Equestria it'd be as easy to write as a trollfic!
I think I am over my drawing phase
11,01Because drawn ask blogs > text ask blogs IMO.
its too much work for not enough awesomeness
Plus it's original!
meow
you had a drawing phase?
oh lawd
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZNKzcbNfHA&feature=related
ScootaChicken: it lasted about one week
Blah.
Again, what's this about blindbags?
Thanks kirzstryfe I owe you one
ScootaChicken: ???
oh
huh Phase4?
lol,
11,14lol, np
mis interpreted "you have a drawing phase?"
/me purrs
meow
11,14walmart is supposed to be getting the blind bag ponies
emangamer did you see my picture?
sorry my web crashed
mfw there's not a single Walmart near me at all.
it was crafted by gods
Hm.
what did you link ScootaChicken
I shall not be buying any sort of pony merchandise.
That's just silly.
LadyCanary: YFW it doesn't matter because walmart is a dick who doesn't carry any GOOD pony merch
ScootaChicken: now I want to kill myself
you can really see the artistic influences shine through
11,01ScootaChicken: That is epic art.
you can tell I put lots of Michaelangelo-esque imagery in there
ScootaChicken: kill me....I dont want to live after seeing that
whats today that meens there is no stream? its australia day here but i'm sure the rest of the world keeps working as normal
11,01No streamers available.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN_70Qm64Ig
11,01I don't know how to take over the stream.
11,14SB said he would when he gets back (from class I'm assuming)
ScootaChicken: I...FUCKING...hate...you
11,01I might not be that trusted yet. *looksaround*
ScootaChicken: this is my own personal drawing btw: http://oi44.tinypic.com/11uyxys.jpg

meow

10,02Dat interlacing

I love how some of the 2-d animations look EXACTLY like Jackie Chan

This is an Europan show.
Yeah, I remember Lyoko was a french cartoon.
idk i really never watched this show tbh
13which just happens to be a title drop
10,02So...are there fanfics of this show?
The tower button was always so awesome.
probs SB
You know it, SuperBrony64
SB, I dunno. Probably.
13oh yes sb
10,02Hahaha
I would think so.
there's probably some
here's my question: Why not just destroy the fucking computer?
13because aelita
of corse some cliche
that would be too easy
Because that would destroy Aelita.
Rawrity: the girl is stuck inside
If there is a pedo-bear in it, there are most certainly fan fics
13jeremie won't admit it but he be in love
Brain Blast!
they were busy getting aleita, the pink hair girl out
wrong cartoon
10,02I've read a fan fic that was well over 150 pages on My Life as a Teenage Robot
Yeah, i know xD
And we find out a whole lot of other stuff in the later seasons why destroying the super computer would be super bad.
Dermathil: Save 1 girl and in the process risk your family, friends, and the lives of hundres of innocent bystanders?
10,02Yay for fanfictions ^_^
/me isnt too big on fanfictions.
Ive read a 2000+ pg fan fic of MLP. Guess what it was :P
13eeyup
I think Aelita would be willing to take the hit.
Rawrity: they have a reset button.
13but they have time travel
^^
FO:E?
Dat baby~
they be trollin for the lolz
10,02What is this...'Code Ponyoko'?
RawketLawnchair: NAAAAAH XD

Code Geass no, but Code MENT... :3
That was amazing, what a treat! Who is streaming??
13what if xana were Daemon?
just thinking... i don't recall much of the opening music...
10,02This one is 3 minutes O___o
Shizu, space station.
code ment is funny
miss toonami and all its bobobobobos
Nooooo PMVs.

Shizuka: yeah. I prefer the original version. I speak french so I'm priviledged, but yeah.
/me goes to cheer up LordCelestia
I enjoy this song actually.
13yeah between the two i like the original better
chimicheerychangas?
last time is watched code lyoko was when i was 3 or so, then i was like im3watisthis and changed it to pokemon
It's not great but it's not really bad or anything.
13although, i have a verstion that mixes the two
13not bad
11,14I like the french version of the song better
Ditzy, how old are you?
13 problem?

inb4 everyone shamelessly says their age
/me hugs SuperBrony64
0,5hehe
Twilgith is a Paladin with that bubble :o

/me pulls everypony into a glomp pile <3
Hey, all
oh god. Mock war is back,.
I am black and what is this?
Ohai Randomnerd
/me joins glomp
i only remember panty scene from lyoko
i never got into code lyoko
me neither
I can't remember, did they still use the "Reset it all" line after the reset thing stopped being a factor?
mfw there is a ________________ user
10,02Me neither, I actually hated the show :P
Dem freshly washed sheets.
13they did on rare occasion
this is looooooooooooong
GUMMY yay!
I loved Code Lyoko! Makes me happy to see it again
Twilight is a mage.
Not a Paladin.
13pretty much only when something world-threatening happened, otherwise once aelita was out the war was mostly confined to lyoko itself
also, Code Lyoko is not an anime.
So many smiliey ponies!
RaveBrony me 2 sorta
XD
Hey Shizu, what was his name again? the traitor.
Tis a french cartoon.
this XD
Neither is Avatar.
13william

yeah that's it.
RawketLawnchair: nah, Twilight would multiclass everything she could
who is streaming btw?
CriticKitten: exactly.
William was a BAMF
the show took too long to get anywhere in every episode, but that sorta changed in later seasons
Doesn't change the sentiment behind my statement.
:p
13with his ff7 cloud sword
yeah
10,02lol I still have these pics
xD
O_o
13who promptly got owned
HAHAH

idk :p
10,02Nope, somepony who linked their image
11,14lol
Also, that's not a swrod, that's a Crickiet bat, Shizuka .
Shizuka: William was where I stopped watching.
>mfw I got kicked for typing normal speed
since he is streaming... le Cafe?
13that was just before season 4, aka the best season ever

Who was your favorite Sailor scout, Shizuka?

in ruby and saphire, wailord and skitty can breed, both part of the same 'egg group'

SuperBrony64 stooooop. You are making me miss my childhood again <3

futurama should do a batman parody and bender should be batman
:O

lol
0,14Mistah J

Now Tara Strong is the VA for Harley
0,14yep

10,02Harley is SUPER AWESOME
Paul Dini can be pretty pervy.

10,02Oh look, Highschool Batman
nooo noooooo noooooooooo
11,14...
11,14wtf
oh, it's "this" batman
...Nope.
God, this series had the fuckiest character designs...
Not my favorite.
Dem evil clowns~
Not. At. All.
0,14I actually...liked this series >.>
Still, it looks to still be better than "Beware the Batman"
that joker looks like a zombie
The Riddler = Man in pajamas
they look weird
It also had some very very dark storylines.
10,02This show doesn't make sense AT ALL with the storyline
Freaky char design is good char design
I never saw it, so I cant say.
11,14BB has its good parts
But Ive heard negativaty about it.
Im bored
awww yeeaaa
Justice League was fun :)
still, "The Batman" was okay. A lot better than THIS is looking to be: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/70/Bewarethebatman-promotional.jpg
0,14also, you know what was my favorite Spider-Man series
I didnt watch Justice League much
0,14Spectacular Spider-Man
Sadly :\
i loves me some dark knight
Justice League wasn't too bad, aye
10,02yfw Luke Skywalker was The Joker
11,14was that the 90s one Saxy?
Oh my god. . .
Yeah :D
Justice League was pretty good, but I never could get into Unlimited.
:O NO WAI SuperBrony64
What's wreong with their faces?
lol mark hamill is the joker... luke skywalker is best badguy
10,02Yup
0,14eenope, kirzstryfe, it was the one that came out a few years ago
RawketLawnchair: it's the S3 Redesign.
11,14don't think I saw that one
pointy chin alert
<3 That laugh
he looks like a troll face
Trololol
Joker is best troll
even better
0,1490s one is my second favorite by a verrry close margin
Mr. Freeze FTW
Mrk Hamill is best Joker.
Dat laugh. It will haunt your nightmares. <3
Unlimited had a incredible moment in "the once and Future Thing", where Batman, GL, and Wonder Woman were teamed up with Bat Lash, Jonah Hex, El Diablo and Smith on horseback with a rendiition of the Justice League OP music-- is mWestern style.
I agree CriticKitten
Ahhh that laaaauuugh <3 it makes me so HAPPY.
Use the laugh luke
0,14dat feel when Mark Hammill and Kevin Conroy were at NYCC and I couldn't go ;n;
lol!!
I know dat feel SaxyPretender.
I know dat feel.
Ninja'd again
Teehee.
awww
It's going to be a sad day when Mark is gone. I don't think anyone will deliver that flawless VAing. :(
that guy looks like a 60 year old luke skywalker
why you gotta be like that
^^
10,02It IS Luke Skywalker
Derpy_1337 that's because he is
10,02SILLY
thats awesome
oh
Awesome! It is!
/me explodes with joy
10,02He does the voice for the Joker
0,14mfw people didn't know that
10,02IKR
FRom jedi to turtle?
/me knew that.
Mark hamill also does Ozai in Avatar
Yeah, Luke Skywalker did several villain roles, the Joker is the best known.
i feel stupid now
I know that
11,14how did people not know that?
10,02Turtle? lol wut
There's a Harley in the background!
eurgh harley let herself go

Not sure if want RAWRity.
I miss that show most of all....
i miss animaniacs
I miss it too.
LadyCanary: It's Alfred FIRING GUNS, how could anyone want it?
Are they seriously making that RAWRity? O_o
11,01Beware the Buttman.
That looks absolutely Horrid
RaveBrony: yep, due out next year.
10,02You all probably didn't know that Tara Strong did Harley Quinn in Arkham Asylum, right?
^
buttman indeed
bat man has a deformed head in the thing you showed me
0,14I did :3
Alfred, with guns?
i knew SB
I knew dat SB64
SuperBrony64: actually, i think we did
I just don't know how anyone will top Mark Hamill's Joker. Heath Ledger did a good interpretation for Dark Knight, but I still think Hamill's is a wee bit better for me.
SuperBrony64: We all knew that.
Oh man....
it was a badly kept surprise
10,02YOU ARE ALL TOO SILLY THEN
11,01Tara Strong did Princess Clara of Drawn Together.
TARA STRONG? who knew?
she did a really good Harley imo
Yeah, I heard, SB. I was psyched.
Its becuz mlp is taking up all the good animation ;)
Good grief-- My stream insists onn lagging impossibly.
Derpy_1337: that's the next Batman series coming out on CN.
0,14also, dat sad feel when Mar4k Hammill and Tara Strong got baaaaaaaaaaaaaaad seats at the SPike TV VGAs
Her Harley is really solid.
Tara Strong's been in a lotta stuff.

"allso fire"

scat means $H!7

odds are SB is switching the feed.
11,14stream's not dead, just idle
this game is just obscenely judgemental
You've gotten stronger kirz. Modship seems to be agreeing with you.
It's already disagreeing with me.
OOOOHHHH now i get the angle of the picture
Um.
nope, its dead
Flaira, shouldn't that read as Flaria?
its dead
it's dead JIM!
Or is this an amalgamation of the two?
I spell my name how I want <3

Duly noted. :p
FLARIA!
Sometimes its Flaria, sometimes Flaira, sometimes Flarai.

/me hugs Randall1160
Flaira: what's your opinion on the Oscar Noms this year?
'ey champ
I'm usually just Lasharus.
Granted, sometimes it's Dr. Robotnik.
and hen i accidentaly clicked on the stream and it closed my chat
RAWRity: As soon as I heard who was nominated I stopped paying attention
what potions can be created in skyrim with diadra hearts?
then'
Alright, stream is live again
and then everyone was pony
PINGAZ
Sometimes its Flar(insert creative twist to nick that seems fitting at the time)
Save the daedra hearts for daedra armor herostar
PINGAS?
is the stream down>?
SuperBrony64: i see no stream
mmk
SnooPINGAS usual I see?
you also need ebony for daedric armor
Flaira: Good move. I'm been seething in rage over some of the snubs this year. Especially after rewatching The Ides of March
dr. robotnic : PINGAS
i see add but no stream

I dont get it
Never you mind.
It won't be an issue for very long.
/me laughs maniacally.
yeah, streams still broken here

/me is suddenly tired and its only 15:28
SuperSonic64 is working on it. Me pinging him isn't helping, I suppose.
/me gives Lasharus a Prrrrromotion!
/me noms SuperBrony64's internet tubes some more
tf2 broke recently
O U
the internet has turned into a big truck
just sayin
I mean, c'mon. I can see War Horse and The Artist getting Best Picture noms, but Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close? The Descendants? The Help? bleh. and Drive didn't even get a mention.
Also, the Robotnik you're referencing is from a cheap knockoff cartoon that they made of me. That version of me is an idiot.
I deserve a..... pppppprrrroooooomotion
Critic RAWRity
I thought I was...0_0
An amusing idiot, but an idiot
so, SB is gonna play Sonic Generations now eh?
Idiotic idiots!
Well, I'm hoping he will Midnight_Tempest. :P
SB is gonna have us watch Sonic X
/me just remembed that derpy is now canon, and is still having trouble beliving it
/me THE CHAMP IS SUDDENly very ti red
I only suggested it to him as a laugh, but who knows. :P
I know he owns the game.
THE CHAMP! : D
god i hope not RAWRity
(And hasn't finished it!)
:P
Sleeep then Randall1160 :3
Now I'm tired Randall
night Randall1160
c: I should
But I am not yet
i just now that SB is gonna play sonic generations... my steam keeps telling me so
oh god... ANYTHING BUT SONIC X
I am not going yet!
gee it sure is boring around here mah boi this peace is what all true warriors strive for i just wonder what ganon is up to
He could also be going for Sonic Unleashed, but that one was not as good.
FOUR!
FOOT
I'm back everypony (for a short time)
dinner
And if he streams Sonic X, I will personally end our enigmatic streamer.
hai eman
but i like Sonic Unleashed
ohey emangamer
mmmmmmm bombs
So do I Midnight_Tempest. But you can't deny that the game was mental.
I mean, really. The 'werehog'?
AoStH would be great
The gameplay was decent, but the concept?
sonic unleashed was witten like poop voiced like poop and played like poop
Lasharus: werehog is a misnomer because were means man. Sonic is not a manhog. More accurate would be hogwolf or wolfhog
the concept was to move gamers away from the wii
Phase4: WRONG.
it was more poop than actual poop
Yes emangamer, I've seen that Zero Punctuation too.
stream...
maybe, but it was one of the best sonic games since Sonic Adventure 2 Battle on the gamecube
Ohai SuperBrony64
It was completely insane Phase4, I'll admit.
BUT!
STREAM IS UP
Lasharus: wrong?
Robotnik was awesome.
Lasharus: I know, it's nice to be so smug....
Let me know if you see the game
BLEH sonic...really?
lamp oil rope bombs you want it you can have it as long a you have enogh rupees
Ghehe, sorry emangamer. :p
Also, this has to be done again.
You see the game?
Sonic Generations? Hm. Alright then!
/me tacklehugs SuperSonic64.
Saga?
Ohai LadyCanary <3
oh look, something sonic
YEEEEEESSSSSSSSS!!!!!
Sonic is neat.
finally
he's gonna play some levels... then i will try to beat his bests
Ooooo generatons
Though you have to give Sega credit for doing pretty good on this game.
something
And yes SuperSonic64 - we see this.
à² _à²  i disaprove
11,01I recently saw Yahtzee's review of Sonic Generations.
^
Funny
I was surprised at how much he hated the game.
I wasn't
But then, his reviews are based on him being a professional hater. :P
And it was a funny review, definitely.
Yahtzee hates everything Lasharus
dat old/new sonic comparision
Got there first Midnight_Tempest :P
I don't like Yatzee, he seems to hate every game he reviews
dat music :>
hey, if SB has a Kinect, he should totally play Sonic Free Riders
...
11,01There are games Yahtzee doesn't hate.
HA!
Need to fix something
11,01Like Painkiller and Psychonauts.
HA!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
sonic was origianaly pixelated so i dont get this game
Hah, lies! Yahtzee hates everything.
That's true enough IngloriousPony89.
/me is going to watch the newest ZP
0,14yeah, I'm not a huge fan of ZP either
ZP?
Sleep well, ponies~
I really quite like Zero Punctuation.
0,14Zero punctuation
still, he complains about pointless stuff nobody cares about
/me hugs #bronystate
I havent watched his reviews in a long time.
Of course he does Dken2021.

/me hugs Flaira
<3
Hi Simon!
not too much of a fan
Bye Flaria!
hello Simon
ohai Simon
Byee flaira!
His reviews aren't based on being accurate representations of the games. They're based on being satirical reviews of games. I don't think he expects people to take him 100% seriously.
ohai Simon
He just spouts his opinion and a bunch of random comedic bollocks around it.
0,14I know for the most part Yahtzee's stuff is an act, but it's too caustic for my tastes
i need to get a windows xbox controller for this game, its hard to play with a keyboard
I woke up so late, it's already 12:35pm
That's perfectly fair Saxy. :)
ima let my computor cool of so brb
Lasharus: well is a review not an opinion
I know he does that for laughs, but whatever, not my cup of tea
0,14^
yeah, im gonna check out the latest review too... forgot it was wednesday
It's an educated opinion supported by rational explanation.
Whereas Yahtzee is spouting his opinion supported by random bollocks. :P
I used to watch him quite a bit. While I like the guy on some levels, I guess I'm just not into his reviews anymore.

Laters Derpy_1337.
No
just 10 min
Shizuka: hi dear!
/me is going to agree to disagree with Lasharus about what his reviews are
/me hugs Shizuka
11,01Honestly, Xpadder is cheaper than buying a 360 PC controller.
/me curls up under blankets
Mine cost $30
11,01Those controllers are rip-offs.
......
Soon KetaminaDianePie. The game will be streamed, worry not...
0,14I need to configure my 360 Fightpad for when Fighting is Magic comes out
11,013rd-party controllers are cheap.
i jus went through more nooks of spells than twilight sparkle o_o

Oh God my cat's going on the offensive
<Minotaur> I think I'll give you a tase of Holy
/me is going to disagree with Lasharus on the principle that it's more fun that way
My brother gave me my XBox controller for PC for free Nittany_Discord. :P
hmmm, my copy of 'shadow of the colussos' should be ariving today or tomorow
/me sighs at kirzstryfe.
11,01But any game build on XNA doesn't support 3rd-party controllers.

Minotaur cast Holy, not enough MP
*dies
Nittany_Discord: srsly?
11,01I wouldn't mind having a 360 controller.

We're actually going into a debate on furries then?

Lasharus: NOPE

Oh for-

Surprisingly, I use Lasharus.
0,14though my current favorite version of Ky's theme is the one from the live concert, where they took his themes from the first GG, GGXX and Overture and put it all together
O.O
Mordered? never heard of him...
YOU DON'T SAY Lasharus!
Sounds like a cool steam name
That sounds quite nice o3o
Yes, it's astonishing.

oh
"Powered by monkeys and unicorns with the help of many friends" i think someone at userscripts.org is a brony
has SB failed me for the last time... again?
I wonder how many times I could read My Little Dashie to get to the point where I don't cry
shed manly tears*
damn is that THAT good?
yeah, easy typo to make that
i would imagine when you die of dehydration OneTrickPony
lol
/me must get back to his "work"
I'm still trying to decide whether to read it
you should it is amazing
ive read my little dashie once, ONCE... and i had never cried so much before... well... not since my granddad and uncle died but thats different T_T
but sad
/me feels like singing.
its not so much sad as powerfull, worth a read
and can potentially cause me to lose control over my emotions
0,14...mfw I just found my hand twin
guess ill give it a try..... even if i hate fanfics
Oh? Whom Saxy
SaxyPretender: o u
0,14http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwTFGNg0vkU
0,14I was watching this video
0,14and realized
....
0,14this person's hands
Dat OOO BELT.
0,14are just like mine
OH MY GOOOOOOD. Want
KetaminaDianePie: is it reading about it you don't like?

PLAY A GAME WHILE I GET THIS FIXED
I already am :p
0,14don't worry SB, I'll distract them
But can you henshin like that SaxyPretender?
yeah i dont like to read
/me has seen the hand twins episode of friends, not by his choice though
0,14XD
im listening to music... The Moody Blues
anyone else like the moody blues?
I think Ive heard of them
Nights in White Satin?
thats a song of theirs
KetaminaDianePie: here is some guy reading it if you prefer that http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tESDlYTkzsI&feature=channel_video_title
perfect
no... damnit no... im not crying again
AAA
noes!
well tbh
...
MLD did not make me tear up
don't tell me if he breaks down in the end, I want to find out my own
RAWRity laughed at MLD
na na i think ill read it
FO: E and Project Horizons DID however
I was like "meh"
i would say your dead inside otakon, but i also cried from FoE and Project Horizons... ah crap, i got some chapters of horizons to finsh
so there is no stream atm?
Midnight_Tempest: I am not dead inside
I can prove it
he dont need a better mic.....
doesn*t
dont open yourself otakon, then you will be just dead
lol ^
I cannot watch that four minute scene from Up without tearing up
he need how to noise reduct better
...Oh god THAT otakon. My heart....
yeah
oh god... >_< you had to bring UP into this...
eeyUP
/me didnt tear up...
O U otakon
Fleur: you have no soul then, I'm sorry.
/me is ok with that
oh man... T_T
oh man toy story 3
/me didnt cry for any of the TS's
0,14I teared up and shed a single tear at the end of TS3
not even the near end of 3?
no
brb
Saxy is a true man... one tear, thats all
In Toy Story 2. The song "When She Loved Me" gets me every time. I bawl.
aw
great song <3
It is pretty sad, yeah.
SBBBBBBBBBB
are you still there?
/me throws a shoe at KetaminaDianePie
no all caps
It is <3
all the toy stories are good'
I think that Toy Story works in 3D. In Live Action, it feels like a gimmick.
I saw it in 3D. It was pretty nice.
I mean, ugh... syntax.
Live action?
/me explodes
oh ok
Cartoons like Toy Story are good in 3D, you can suspend disbelief if it looks unrealistic.
sory Fleur :(
YEah, I'm still working on it :/
aparently i saw toy story on ice, but i was 4 or 5
But live-action films with 3D effects look gimmicky.
0,14mfw the full version of the Climax Heroes Fourze OP is out
take your time SB, haning with these bronies is tonnes of fun as it is
/me glances at clock...
SuperBrony64: need any help?

KetaminaDianePie: problem is i am a native english speaker

Ambiguity! thats ti

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=nV_NHvEEVvw Just gonna drop this wonderous Okami piano arrangement.
/me is a programer and engineer, he has no need of your silly english
lol Okami
0,14...it had to be Reset
Phase4 :)
0,14that one song
0,14that can make me tear up
....Oopsie...
man tears Saxy
man tears
at least your language has no double negations that means negation
dem double negatives
I-I'm sorry Saxy ._.
0,14fun fact: I was once reading through TVTropes' Crowning Moment of Heartwarming section
dont be sorry LadyCanary, its a good song
0,14in the Real Life part
0,14while listening to Reset~Thank You
Aw~
wow, that is good music
thats your own fauly Saxy... you can always stop doing both...
fault*
Phase4: Have you ever played Okami?
nope, realy should
Highly reccomend it.
btw i had that problem with my right eye too Midnight_Tempest
Such a shame Clover Studios is no more ;^;
luckly it fixed by itself
lol mines my left
0,14I get to a point where it's pointed out against how there was a European country (I think Norway or Finland) that did surrender to Germany but they were able to get as many Jewish people out of the country and save a lot of lives
i think that was norway
0,14a Troper from said country thanked the person who put that entry
0,14for making them realize that Norway did something useful despite giving in
0,14someone else said "No need, your country saved a lot of lives"
0,14and I just lost it
0,14started crying
What a sacrifice. *hugs SaxyPretender*
0,14I don't know what it was
0,14but I felt so incredibly moved
0,14and it's the small things like that
0,14that give me faith in humanity
WW2... the worst war ever, there is nothing about that war that should be glorified except the people that helped all those Jews escape... they are the true heroes of the war
0,14Well said.
aww damn... i just made myself tear up... T_T
0,14I know that there's a lot of bad people and bad things in this world
me too....
No doubt.
im thinkin about my granpa
0,14but we can't ever forget the good things, and the people that are willing to fight back
and this song is so fitting... *man tears*
You're darn right, Saxy. :)
...Crap. Im crying now.
0,14awwww
i need something happy... something silly... T_T
/me hugs LadyCanary and everyone else.
/me hugs SaxyPretender
/me group hugs everypony

down to 3-8 fps
fairly laggy
some of it might be my browser

:O
Going good SB
:P
0,14if I had the money, I'd pick it up, but I just barely have enough for Soul Calibur V as is
Yup Phase4. :P
this looks like an ok racing game
It is quite good.
Get the console version though.
this works reeeeally better SB
They cut support for the PC version extremely quickly.
/me played the crap out of sonic heroes
/me never really could get into Sonic Heroes.
0,14^
dat shadow
DAMN U SHADOW!
i managed to get A with team dark on the second last stage
0,14I meant to ^ what Phase4 said
why does he need a cycle?
u damn emo..........
WHY?!
the one on the giant ship in the storm
he can RUN!
becuse card games
I'm with KetaminaDianePie here actually. Shadow's bloody irritating :p
mfw Im not the only one who actually enjoyed Sonic Heroes.
*because
And after getting amnesia the third time, you'd expect him to at least write a diary or SOMETHING.
goodnight everypony
I enjoyed it at the time
night OneTrickPony
Night OneTrickPony!
0,14I liked Sonic Heroes, but I just wish all the levels weren't the same for the most part
0,14later OneTrickPony
but not really anymore
Been a LOOONG time.
later OneTrickPony
IKR
night OneTrickPony
Yaaaaay SB64!!!
I didn't like Heroes too much. Possibly due to a fair number of bugs.
Disclaimer: sonic heroes is not a 'sonic game' persay, but rater a different kind of game with sonic in it. still a good game though
Sonic Heroes.....
A winner is Shadow?
Or possibly because the triple-character gameplay didn't appeal. I dunno.
Lasharus: i learned to use them
reallly?
they used the phrase
A WINNER IS......
/me facepalms
allcaps
0,14the Sonic forums I used to go on did not take too kidnly to Sonic Heroes
It's a little better than "You're Winner!" otakon. :P
A little.
thats fair, its not what they wanted, but its a good game
08,14SuperBrony64. . ?
Eh, I've no reason to hate on Sonic games.
ohai DerpyHooves`
DerpyHooves`!
Ohai Vi! :3
0,14...or Shadow the Hedgehog, but that was to be expected
Well, except Sonic 2006 and Shadow.
Heh.

/me hugs otakon

sorry Shizuka, I'm not that actioney
...Long hair? XD
a Lady
usually has long hair
13aww, but it's not the beard on the outside that counts, it's the beard on the inside
:D
0,14oh yeah, Shizuka, did you see the new Sinfest?
omg
I remember that quote!
13i saw
SuperBrony64 you should download the multiplayer batman game on PSN so we can play together :D
action hank.......
13i wonder if fyoosh will find him on sunday
0,14I don't know where this arc is going and I'm worried
i used to love action hank
0,14how can 4 panels cause so much anticipation?

I don't have my PS3 with me Fleur ;___;
Oh
cmon SB..... stream some gamecube.......
DerpyHooves`: do you have a version of your brothers cover somewhere accessible?
That would explain it
thats easy
I got my think to work...I hope
that sucks SuperBrony64 :(
13pebbles~
lolwut
Woah

0,14I thought it was Tangerine?
13oh..

One minute stream is down

welcome to bronystate
XD
That's why I watch the episodes here
Because this is a good place
0,14dat Amy theme
Hw does it look?
Much better.
Oh we do alot more than episodes
Amy :D!
Bah. Robotnik.
:P
looks gooooooooooooood SB
needs moar Pingas
I came here when we were watching that movie about evil videogame playing AI
Sorry, I slipped.
suuuuuuure
That was launching satelites at the nuclear plants
too bad sonic generation didnt work :(
Can't win 'em all :(
0,14ahhh, pingas, the phrase that made Mike Pollack not take fan requests ever
^
Who wants to suggest an idea for the fanfic i'm writing?
XD
Hardly surprising SaxyPretender.
If highly regrettable, the man's brilliant as Robotnik.
0,14yep, one of the few high points of Sonic X
Yup.
XD
Sonic X?
Of course, you can see he's a bit flat in the first couple of episodes.
0,14too bad the rest of the 4kids crew had to come with him
were talking AoStH here
But unlike the other voice actors, HE grew into his role.
0,14yep
huh :O?
lol
wut
argh
-_-
4kids
that is a dirty word
LETS RACE!!!
4chan
The bane of existence.
yes
0,14I remember I played an early demo of Sonic 2006
alot of things that start with 4 are bad words
0,14and was looking forward to it
0,14so much
0,14...and then...
Sonic 2006's only two saving graces:
Robotnik.
SaxyPretender: the one with the real people in the cutscenes?
4kids, 4chan, 4play...
And the return of the Egg Carrier.
SaxyPretender :O?
MFW top of 4chan is pony thread
the list goes on XP
so
LOL someone always notices when i appear in the room:D
Time for bed, godnight all.
0,14later Randomnerd!
goodnight
anything with 4 in the fron is bad huh?
night Randomnerd sleep well
0,14also, eeyup, otakon, THAT one
Bye Randomnerd!
SaxyPretender: good lord
i come and go
By otakon
NIIIIGHT :D!
0,14the thing is, I think the demo I played was when the game was acutally promising
Bye, LadyCanary
Highly likely.
But even then it already suffered from numerous issues.
You know what was a good Sonic game?
0,14and then Sonic Team had to rush it...and we got THAT
Bye, SaxyPretender!
never saw the demo.......
Things didn't improve as development continued. :P
Sonic Adventure
i heard they were making a sequel
that was a good sonic game
Adventure was pretty good, aye.
0,14SA2:B was the first Sonic game I owned <3
no all stars racing
To my knowledge, the ending basically goes "and it all never happened. The end."
Oh, I like that.
best thing of Adventure were Chaos............. and i LOVE Sonic
More racing as Robotnik.
&
0,14mainly because I grew up without a Sega system as a kid
*^
Segaaaaa
You poor thing SaxyPretender :(
/me hugs SaxyPretender
0,14but I knew people who had them and I liked the Sonic series growing up
0,14I even had Sonic Bubble Bath!
:O
strange thing that i want a nes and got a sega genesis lol
I grew up with a PS2. Twas nice
I grew up with a NES
good times
0,14so I was a Sonic fan, but had never played the games until SA2:B
/me weeps for his lost NES
0,14...needless to say, it was a good first impression
Daw
I never had a game console until I got my PS2
Adventure 2 is probably the primary reason for my Robotnik-fanboyism. :P
i grew up with PC..... btw on consoles i always stick to Sonic
i still have my originally ps2. the fan is really loud though. sounds like a jet in my room lol
AoStH Robotnik > ALL robotniks
AoStH?
no
i sold my PS2 for a GameCube :D!
Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog otakon.
Cartoon.
Lasharus: oh god what
no
There were several.
SatAM Robotnik ftw
SatAM was the darkest of the cartoons, probably.
That was a REAL villain!
Sonic X is the worst.
And AoStH is the most insane.
my god, I should see if I can find that show again
AoStH is insanity on a stick
otakon, I have the full series on my harddrive.
sonic x...*shivers* o_o
Lasharus: you lucky bugger
There are downloads...
Eh, very low resolution.
trye
the only thing that I thought was fairly good about X
*true
Mike Pollock.
was the intro
i like it
No no, Mike Pollock.
naw
yea
X just... didnt cut it as a whole
this course is awesome in sonic heroes
ow SB's back :)
god i hated this level
damn pinball of death
in this game or heroes?
This level in Sonic Heroes was glorious
^
\o/
my god SB....... you look badass at this game....................................
heroes kept falling off the board -_-
the second act was better, and had more awesome music
I WANT TO CHALLANGE U!
^
KetaminaDianePie - I've played this game a LOT, and you're right. SuperBrony64 is bloody good at this. :P
dat drift yes
Goodnight guys. See you all tomorrow ^_^
cya
And I want to challenge him, but the PC version doesn't support multiplayer :(
Lol I now understand every one couldn't believe Derpy was talking in "The Last Roundup* Just saw how hilarious it was to see yall GO OMG WOO!
Lasharus i play multyplayer alot with my friends.......
i still got my copy of sonic heroes somewhere, lets see if it'l work in wine
I'll have to get my PS3 online then at some point KetaminaDianePie, won't I? :P
we all are Hardcore gamerz
I'm not sure if soaking it in alcohol will work Phase4.
:|
Bye
i wish sega would bring back jet grind radio
Lasharus: xD
me too
I remember than!
(Sorry, I couldn't resist)
that*
I wish they'd make a port of Skies of Arcadia
thats good Lasharus! my PSN ID is HyperBolo!
Definitely.
for the PS3/Xbox360
I've been wanting to try that game forever otakon.
I remember that too!
But sadly, I don't own a gamecube, and my Dreamcast is almost dead.
skies of arcadia is suposed to be awesome but i have no dreamcast
Though I never got a chance to play it.
mines werehog202 if anybody wants to add me on psn
Lasharus: the gc version is mostly the difinite version
wait, theres a gamecube version?
port
onward to ebay
with lots more
Mine's Lasharus KetaminaDianePie. Unsurprising, really.
yes
Phase4: it's about 100 dollars
...Now I wanna play Space Channel 5.
I'm considering just getting an emulator for the gamecube now.
then onward to piratebay
I have Space Channel 5 Part 2
LadyCanary: you can find it on the PS2, and on LIVE>
R.I.P MEGAUPLOAD =(
Ill add u soonLasharus! and ill see wut games are u into :D!
fun to come back to every once in a while
http://youtu.be/KOEjOUlhSFE << heres the music for the second act of the casino level
otakon: I HAD it for the PS2. But my ex took it back. FFFFFFF.
How is the stream so far?
Good!
0,14good SB
Perfectly fine SuperBrony64 :)
LadyCanary: grab another copy from Amazon dear
working excelently
Ah yes.
Acid Trip track.
...Aw man, I wanted to play this game too.
I almost forgot about this one.
Samba DE JANAIRO!!!!!!!!!!!!
SEIZURE TRACK
0,14oh Shadow
yes
0,14you may be my favorite character
aww
sooooooo triiiiiiiiiiiippy
WHAT!?
damn it!
why you pause?
0,14but your angsty-ness can get on my nerves
PLAY SAMBA DE JANAIRO!
lol
SaxyPretender, say that favourite character thing again, paying attention to every word, would you?
0,14...I know what I said =P
Because I think you inadvertently said something horrendous.
ok, i'm a litle bored so i'm off to attempt to debug sonic heroes in wine. NEVER done this before and no training. if i dont come back within 30min ding me to make sure my pc still works
okay Phase4
0,14gotcha, Phase4, good luck!
have fun

Shadow's a boring one-dimensional angsty triple amnesiac for god's sake!
HNNNNG my baby ;^;
0,14Well, he was interesting in SA2
dont you mean sasuke from naruto Lasharus?
Yup.
And if he stayed dead, I would've been happy.
or Vincent from FF7?
0,14I would've been okay with that too
SB?
or Fenris for Dragon Age 2?
vincent had style though
Hai :3
No, none of them are triple amnesiacs.
Try to keep up.
0,14I don't mind Shadow (pardon the pun) archetypes for characters
0,14Spider-Man has Venom
0,14for example
Lasharus: Fenris was a amniesiac
Triple?
hell, CLOUD counts too!
0,14but you don't see Venom fighting Spidey EVERY issue
OOOOWW YEEEAH!
0,14Shadow should be used the same way
BEST
Because Shadow was an amnesiac at the start of SA2, at the start of Heroes, AND at the start of his own trainwreck. Sorry, game.
Lasharus: how can you lose your memories three times?
OST
EVER!
I don't know otakon. Ask bloody Shadow.
noooo
He did it
Lasharus: they aren't in order
13why does he need a vehicle..
Shizuka: I just asked that
No otakon, they're all out of order. In every sense of the phrase.
0,14Because bikes are edgy and cool
Lasharus: agreed
For the ANGST.
05Gentlecolts!
I tried to play Shadow the Hedgehog
05may i make a suggestion?
I was horrible
Go for it.
05Slap my plot.
...wot.
I knew it
0,14...
Do tell Wrek. Wait what.
...
0,14NOT IT
/me refuses.
I KNEW he was gonna do that
NOT It!
/me backs out.
/me dances hard to this music
05*snort snort*
And back to the Sonic conversation.
Where was I?
i bought shadow the hedgehog for 5 bucks at eb games
13that thing handles like a greased pig...
Oh yes, Robotnik is awesome.
0,14he is
13a stick of butter has better traction
Because hes riding that hog.
Shizuka: Shadow handles like a greased pig
I prefer racing as Robotnik in this game Shizuka. :P
He might not accellerate fast, but by god does he race. :p
05im dissapointed :|
0,14but yeah, I was looking forward to Shadow the Hedgehog
anyone here play the Dark Brotherhood RPG on the DS?
0,14played through it, and was like ehhhhh
it was pretty good actually
Yes otakon.
tooo bad it was shadow
It was pretty good, but it had one drawback.
0,14I enjoyed certain aspects like the music
The earpiercing MUSIC.
meh i couldnt get into it
yeah
Who the hell was responsible for that atrocious score?
the tunes were not the usually sonic goodness
8-bit games do better.
That would be SuperBrony64 dear Lasharus.
I don't know why
SuperBrony64, do i have permission to link two youtube videos?
yea played it on mute
Sonic games seem to ALWAYS have good music
0,14^
0,14that is true
and great cgi
I was talking about the musical score in the Dark Brotherhood game LadyCanary. :p
mega man games have better music
Pardon me ^^"
05as for game music
Ingwaz: correct
true
05Unreal tournament alwasy impressed me
0,14I used to have a theory that after SA2:B, the better the music the worse the reception
really?
Yes, you can post YouTube links
0,14Sonic Heroes = okay music, okay-ish game
Unreal Tournament..................
FTW NYEEEEEAH!
Just for amusement purposes then.
0,14Sonic 2006, great music, TERRIBLE game
SaxyPretender: sounds about right, Sonic COLORS had GREAT music. Was not well recieved
0,14...
0,14it was
0,14very much so
really?
you sure?
0,14yep
THIS is the music from Sonic: The Dark Brotherhood in Central City (you may want to close the vid fast)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6o47N-aYd08&feature=related
Favorite song in SA2:B was Escape from the City, or whatever it was called.
But Sonic Generations has great music and gameplay :)
dear god
THIS is from Sonic 3D, the original version:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mf7-ixllcgo
MY EARS!
Check the original version.
gods almight I forgot how bad it sounded!
So a game that was about 8-10 years older did about 50 times better.
That's kinda sad.
yeah
it is
Sonic 3D..............
ouch :'(
the original sounds SO GOOD
Might not have been a brilliant game, but the music was fantastic :P
my first sonic delusion...................
I'll be honest
I like alot of the vocal themes done recently
dunno Lasharus........
i cant stand sonic 3d
Incidentally, my apologies for causing eardrum damage with my first video.
/me just remembered his old username on his previous internet home which was a Sonic forum
Well, Im off to bed, everyone. Have a good day/night and love you all. <3 Thanks for streaming SB!

But the music wasn't, it was great. :p
That's all I'm saying :p

08,14Sonic CD <3
0,14I got it from one of my favorite Foo Fighters song
I... was planning on linking the final boss theme of that now KetaminaDianePie. :p
Because I agree with some songs from CD being better.
08,14Sonic boom
08,14SONIC BOOOM
(though I feel some are worse)
13rainboom?
DerpyHooves`: your brothers cover you played before! Is it on Youtube? I would like to hear it again please!

08,14Sonic Boom ist a great song. . .
It is, definitely.
0,14also, dat feel Jun Senoue's favorite song is still Live and learn
But I like this one better. :p
Sonic Boom is the BEST Sonic song.....
i like the gameover music lolz
obviously
The ultimate freak-out song in human history: Underwater countdown in Sonic.
08,14Drowning musik
Got there first Vi. :p
yeah
08,14Eenope
Yes I did.
08,14Underwater countdown < Drowning Musik
On my screen, at least :(
WRONG
btw Sonic R OST is better...........
13RIGHT
DerpyHooves`: are you ignoring my question dear?
Oh you hush, it's referring to the same thing Violet. :p
Just give me this *sniff*
/me 13pats Lasharus und gives a rose

SB?
soon it will hunger for more
oh....i feel awesome....just beat somebody in blazblue whos twice my level and psr, psr of 152
0,14niiiiiiiiiiiice
Ingwaz: it's a fighting game, what does level have to do with it?
level shows your skill level
0,14PSR = rough indicator of skill
05never liekd blazblue
ah
he was level 72, im level 34
I never played it
DerpyHooves` you still up it's 8am for you and unlike me I don;t think you got up only 11 hours ago
blazblue is good
plus, I SUCK at fighting games
for him to lose to me is a big loss
0,14What was the matchup?
Ingwaz: bad day for him?
he drops a skill level and when you're that high up, the skill levels are hard to get
it happnes
like how you miss a 29 YARD FIELD GOAL!
no, he was good, he really was, he beat me the first time we fought, and i beat him the second, first time though i did give him a run for his money
ARGH! how the HELL did he miss that damn field goal!
and it was hazama vs bang SaxyPretender, i play hazama
05so you're saying Ingwaz, that you are the prodigy that beats everyone miraculously, just like in the old series of pokÃ©mon, bayblade, yugiyoh n so on n so forth
oh lord
no
not in the least wrek, i usually lose
just no
0,14dat Hazama

0,14btw, what was the GT of the Bang player?
13bye wrek~
0,14later Wrek
SuperBrony64.....
dont stop the stream daaamit
shave well Wrek
I spent the day mostly inbed being ill
dont remember, shall have to check my video files as i decided to save it since it was a bit close, i like to study my close match ups to see wher ei wen wrong
it wasn't fun
0,14ah
his gt is kilabeep3
Sorry, phone ;___;
13dem beginning of the year illnesses... they are everywhere :<
0,14kilabeep3...I THINK I've seen that name on Dustloop
AH!
sory :(
08,14de_dust?
08,14cs_office
13plr_hightower?
0,14iirc he's a pretty good Bang
Shizuka I blame my mother she's a school teacher she offten brings home fun bugs
he did pretty good, but he left himself open a bit
08,14Dumori: i balme sxyparetdner
X3
13^
charging in from the other end of the screen at hazama is a bad idea, easy chain hit
13as long as you do not die of dysentery :<
he did that a few times
but yeah I need to eat
I've been too ill to hold much down for 2 days now
0,14ouch, Dumori
meh
0,14also, yeah, Hazama's zoning is pretty strong
I've not eatten for 2 days for worse reasons
13oh... flu?
like lazyness
yeah, i need to work on my zoning and defence with hazama
i've been mostly focusing on his advaned combos before this
see?
0,14I'm a Bang player myself, abeit a TERRIBAD one
I can't do that kind of stuff
13i have found things like gatorade help a lot to keep hydrated, more than just water
I don't have the reflex's for it
0,14that's why you practice
bangs getting a bit of a buff in extend i think
I'm gonna play some Nuclear Dawn
0,14I hope so
making it easier to get his furikazan
maybe get some time in as com
SaxyPretender: I have played for hours before, just on STREET FIGHTER ALPHA 3! I cannot get that stuff down.
13but for food... chicken noodle soup ist the king of soups for when you are ill
yes
^
but we don't have anny
damn, now I'm hungry
hakumen, and mu-13 are getting buffed to insanity though...both are possible a tier now
and I'm too ill to buy any
Dumori: well, hot clear broth will work in a pinch
13in close second is chicken und rice with some crackers crumbled up to lessen the sodium a little
tager is getting a ridiculous buff for extend as well
do you have a boullion cubes Dumori?
is the stream paused or something?
0,14oh yeah, I saw the day 1 tier list for Tager
13und in third ramen, just for the broth
yeah Fleur
I have stuff
0,14I was like Tager for B?
0,14No wai
I don't know where SB went again
I have about 1000 diffrent soups
its ridiculous, you take the charcter whos a throw character, and buff his combos and damage like crazy
they are my main food
0,14and then my friend who mains Tager sent me his combos
oh ok. I was thinking my end was fucked up
and hes potentially a tier, not just b tier
Dumori: remember, clear broth is best when your sick.
nothing thick
I knok
know
you knok?
0,14it is possible to make a grapple charcter goos
0,14*good
13knokc knock
potemkin
0,14like Potemkin
but when one gets dehydrated as you can't hold down water
/me just remembered that she hasent eaten in two days
I don't know why your knocking....
soup is a no
Dumori: well, just keep hydrating
that's all you can do
13so much not eating... we must hold a bronystate feast tomorrow
i have no problem with tager being balanced, but as he is inextend....thats not ballanced
stream please..............................................
13to celebrate.... um.... thursday?
the only winning option against tager now is to run like crazy
before you could at least tangle with him if you played it smart
I'm better now then I was yesterday
0,14Bang has it kinda easy in that regard
/me doesnt like it when she doesnt eat ;___;
Shizuka: I have news! I'm makeing bread tomorrow! I shall take pictures!
I ate a samwitch
and every thing
13huzzah
but the last two days where crappy
0,14Poison nail, bumpers/FRKZ and run away all day
it will probably be horrible though
/me will try to go eat something
hazama can run all day, but i dont like to do that, seems, unsportsmanlike
Fleur: you do that
0,14same
I could make bread today
/me hopes her appitite will allow her to
0,14especially because the Hazama/Tager is soooooooooooooo dumb
0,14Mike Z hates it
we have a fuckton of yeast and flour
0,14with a burning passion
I have NO idea what your talking about SaxyPretender
0,14Tager is a grapple character like Zangief
^
0,14he needs to get in very close to do damage
lol, fought some poor tager player as well, he'd only played like 30 matches and was level 22 so i thought he might be good, he was terrible
0,14he has little options to do so
0,14Hazama is VERY good at fighting from a distance
not really sax, hazama's sweet spot is up close as well
/me fights best with Jen and the police woman
hes got good zoning at a long range, but not damage
0,14true
the police woman who looks like Bridget
hazama doesnt have any options at mid range at all, his chains dont stun enough and his moves dont reach far enough
0,14in any case, the Hazama/Tager matchup is in hazama's favor
0,14also, the police woman is Noel Vermillion
her!
if hazama chooses to play it smart, yeah, hes got a serious advantage
thank you saxy
0,14np
0,14XD
NOEL VERMILION..............
/me keeps the combo going as Noel
damn i hate that bvitch
I'm off to bed
good night everyone
no breathing room whatsoever is how I play her
0,14it's been a while since I kept up with BB knowledge
night bluestrom_S
0,14later bluestrom_S
oh sax, you'll like this, was playing a guy a long time ago, the type of guy who plays as tager and sets the timer for 30 seconds so he only has to hit you then wait you out (thats what he actually did)
0,14...
Any pony here play nuclear dawn?
started using hazama to my advantage when i realized what he was doing, he got pissed and switched to beginner mode unlimited mu-12
not I Dumorimasoddaa
0,14...
0,14SCRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUB
killed him in 22 seconds and he didnt even touch me
0,14Ingwaz /)
it was glorious
(\
Alright, going back to stream
0,14I may not be good myself, but if I lose, I take it and try not to get salty
finally
i have no problem losing provided the player is legitimately skilled
GOGOGOGO SB :D!
0,14same
the stronger my opponents the better i become
SuperBrony64: what the hay was that all about?
0,14I was on a 27 win streak in MvC3 the other day
argh
god, i havent played mvc3 in ages
0,14and someone using Wolverine, Akuma and chun-Li beat me
WHy do I suck at fighting games so much?
0,14and while they were using top tier guys
wow....sounds like potential for scrubbiness
0,14they played them very well
actually
btw...... ;PPPPPPPPPPPPP SHADOW!
i'm off for a bit, got stuff to do and this site is VERY distracting. later
sonic sez
0,14later Phase4!
I have a event that happened that perplexed my
see ya later Phase4
Laters Phase4.
0,14He knew to punish my stuff and played it safe with his dive kicks
ALEX KID!
My friend, who is a girl beat ALL of us at Street Fighter 2 HD Turbo with Chun Li
i got tired of mvc3 pretty quick, i liked to play my brother and his friend, apparently their idea of a winning strategy is to pick mostly blaster characters or beef tanks like sentinel before he was nerfed and just blast all day
0,14^
0,14people still do that
ah the old keep away strategy
like Cable!
0,14just yesterday, I was fighting some guy
my brother got a bit more skill, mostly relying heavily on wesker and his ridiculous pressure
0,14using Hulk, Sent and Dormammu
0,14his entire Sent stategy was NEUTRAKLIZE, NEUTRALIZE
yep...
0,14and while my Hulk can't punish it that well
0,14my Tasky can :3
Ingwaz.... u r a noob....... the best blast team is obviously Morgan, Akuma nand Deadpool :D!
0,14so while he was spitting up plasma
0,14I just jumped and shot arrows
*and
lol, reminds me of another one, dont remember my whole team but fighting my brother, i've lost at elast one and zero comes out...hes got sentinel, he has the brilliance to say i have no chance, before i use zeros obscene speed to cross him up in to oblivion
0,14if he wants to play keepaway, I can too
i hate playing keep away
probably too aggressive on my part but imo, its a fighting game, keep away isnt fighting
0,14so do I, but if it gets me the win in the end, or if they start it
if they start it, i'm more okay with it, but still not a fan
0,14same
same reason why i dont play ssf4 anymore, kept running in to e-hondas who would only do that launch across the screen attack
0,14ahh, SSF4
0,14I don't play that online
<3 Ulala :)
0,14heck, I don't even play it
Ingwaz: what? no M.Bison Slide Knee or Psycho Crusher?
/me doesnt play many fighting games because her brothers are not too good at them and she always feels like a dick for destroying them
Ulaaaalaaaa!
seriously otakon, i ran in to a few of theses guys, and all they would do is launch themselves across the screen
Back in Black :D!
over and over and over, the speed at which e-honda moves is hard to counter
/me feels like a bigger dick when she holds back
Ingwaz: I can feel ya on that
with that one attack i mean
I never win so it doesn't matter
never
nooo wait sory.....
13was ist going on in this thread
Wrapped in Black!
hell, I remember Soul Calibur 4

No royal cantrtlot voice

BAD_CHATTER please change your name to one with less caps ^_^
try /nick Bad_Chatter
say what BAD_CHATTER?
do u have a problem with capital letters my friend
inchat voice
/me 's eyes narrow
are u gonna answer my question
BAD_CHATTER: allcaps are frowned upon in the rules if they are used excessively
sounds like a person problem to me
personal
sounds like a rule break to me
;-; Why must I be awake inthe middle of the night.
is the chat police gonna come after me
Well, there ARE mods for this sort of thing, yes.
Please change your name to have lower case letters BAD_CHATTER
SuperBrony64 he just called you out
Case in point, thank you SuperBrony64 :P
BAD_CHATTER,
indeed
let me try something on a level that you people can understand
U MAD LOL
This is surprising.
Sounds about right
13i ain't even mad
Wanting AKILL?
/me calls in the hit squad
D'aw, I was just poking fun at him SuperBrony64. :P
Already been kicked it semes
lol
Oh well, cheers. :)
;_;
hello DJMidgetBrony
banhammer
Wow, what a rebel. I think I'm in love <3
...
lol
=___=
nah, it's just a kick I'm sure
I could have done a worst ban
But meh
it was just a kick
I.... nvm.....
Oh yay
see?
Welcome back my good fellow!
how are y'all
okay
good 2 hear
go SB!
I'm good, thank you.
BAD_CHATTER type /nick Bad_Chatter
did this oper scumbag just threaten network ban @ me
if you would be so kind
Oh deary me.
aww GROSS!
It's so exceptionally exciting to see your exasperating self again BAD_CHATTER
O_o which oper
u
That's all salt?
whats this "AKILL" business
SuperBrony64, would you be so good as to get rid of this cretin now though?
Tovler: I think so
I hated this level :[
can we chat
i want to chat
hold on
why won't you let me chat
he's not breaking rules
AKILL Permanent kill on the network
well
otakon?
13smart to call an oper a scumbag...
because you wont change your name silly
Hai BAD_CHATTER
please change your name
Could I just quote back to you him calling an op a scumbag?
I think that that constitutes breaking a rule.
/me hugs BAD_CHATTER
Meh
And idiocy.
Definitely idiocy. :)
Wow, what a badass
snitch
:D
......
listen
Yes navi?
Please be nice, we love and tolerate each other in this room
if you cant handle capital letters
no you listen
you can't tolerate my nick
... go!
I'm giving you one last warning
im trying to tolerate
you just want to ban for no reason
Change your nick to lower case
Well
That's all I'm asking right now
BAD_CHATTER: it's not that, it is a rule of the room here to go easy on allcaps
for one Your yelling your name across the network
its going against everything you are for
this really shouldnt be that big of a problem, at least for now
2 You just called out an IRCop
BAD_CHATTER: going against an order from an OP is grounds for a ban
none of my chats are in allcaps though
your nick is allcaps
Your nickname breaks the all caps rule BAD_CHATTER. That is all. You decided to troll as opposed to changing it. Ergo, I've little compunction in being sarcastic.
if an op told you to jump off a cliff would you do it?
please change your name
Please everypony, let me deal with him
Okay, I'll shut it. :p
odl
Fine then SuperBrony
owww dammmit............ Gogogo SB!
\o
/me shuts up but glares
13guys, calm, it is being handled
BAD_CHATTER: Just change your name please, thats all I want
why can't you tolerate my nickname
Its fine, just needs to be lowercase
Yeah, sorry. I can never resist responding in these situations. It's a bad habit of mine that I should break.
(but can't. :P)
so DJMidgetBrony what brings you from brony?
Please come back when you have done so
he's here to abuse his opers at me
Just chillin in the rooms

TT^TT
blah.. figures the time I want to draw I have no music playlists on youtube ._.
The lunatic is in my head. The lunatics are in my head. You raise the blade, you make the change. You re-arrange me 'till I'm sane.
You lock the door and throw away the key. There's someone in my head, but it's not me.
whoooaaaaa
Pipsqueak story?
Okay.
Guize, I need some assistance with this oc, it's about the mane.
gimmeh a sec and I'll show you
I'm not sure if there's anyone else here besides you, KetaminaDianePie and me.
I'm still here
im here.... almost.....
Ah.
ok so..
yes or no on the bangs of this Mane
http://i.imgur.com/b2rLe.png
>Fashion
Not my division.
im gonna playing some sonic generations since SuperBrony64|Zzz deluded me........
@_@
Still, I think I prefer the bangs.
ok I see.
back to ze verk
I say bangs
ok HMD =p
bangs stay
XD
I don't know why, but I like black mixed with colours like green.
i love black and green :D!
Skrillex - Bangarang = best drawing mood ever
It's an appealing style choice for various reasons
sorry for interupting, but is the steam offline again now?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR2XilcGYOo&ob=av2e
XD
This is my drawing music lol
heres mine pony http://i301.photobucket.com/albums/nn73/stanzadifabio/myPony.png
I haven't made an OC pony.
I don't know what I'd use it for.
unicorn
I'm using MS Paint for mine.
Besides, I can't draw ponies for my life.
just use the pony creator! its THAT easy :D!
I'm still deciding wheather or not too make mine Unicorn or Pegasus
using that as a basis for a hand drawn OC
And then, I wouldn't know what to do with it.
Pegasi ftw <3
who cares! just do it!
alicorns are overrated xD
HeavyMetalDash: Despite never planning to make an OC pony, I've pondered that question myself for a very long time, weighing out the pro's and con's of both races.
And I came to the conclusion that while it would be great being able to perform magic, it doesn
Only problem I'm coming across is a name for me as an OC pony, and my cutie mark.
I have a concept sketch of him as a pegasus but I think I'm leaning towards unicorn for the function of his special talent
all big problems ._.
...it doesn't give you the ability to soar through the skies majestically.
Like an eagle.
Piloting a blimp.
but does an artist require such a skill?
No, and in the end, I figured that while it would be fun, certainly, it doesn't quite fit me.
hello again
Also I'm having a hard time drawing ...well...cute
I am absolutely obsessed with reading, and it kind of contradicts what being a pegasus allows you to do.
?????
Oh hi, Phase4.
:O!
I was just overthinking stuff again.
yes
Because if there's one thing I like to do asides from read, it's overthink stuff.
you do
dat Phase4
reading and overthinking, the hobby's of any true nerd
may i join in?
Most certainly
i wonder how are you with games with character customisation..............
KetaminaDianePie: I spent just about an hour in Skyrim.
Could be longer.
......
you remind me of my best friend..........
Great song to draw too.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6s4n76ti3Xs
I was still not quite satisfied with the nose, but it would have to do.
btw unicorns are better.......
just try to think how would be to play videogames as a pony
KetaminaDianePie: It depends on what you like to do.
I know a few sports fans, for example.
welll
i fckn LOVE VIDEOGAMES!
lol
and computers
Exactly.
I wish I could stream for you guys to keep you entertained @_@
and making electronic music.....
I'd draw, you'd listen to music and watch me draw lol.
pegasus cant do that.....
I would have a hard time being satisfied with being a pegasus.
I think I'll make more than on OC and then write a fic
problem solved
:D!
btw.....
cant unicorns fly with magic?
I've started writing about a dozen fics (Yay! I got to use 'dozen'!), but I've never actually finished one.
KetaminaDianePie: Yes, but it requires an immense amount of magic, as demonstrated in episode 15.
16*
bah......
u saw last episodes with the pie family?
Last Roundup?
nope
uh well I think that can actually be explained
Family Appreciation Day?
hmmmmmmmmmmm
With the zapapples?
Baby Cakes!
Ah.
With Pinkie and the Cakes.
as was stated Baby Unicorns are prone to burst of magic. That doesn't mean that the baby was tapping into it's own reserves it was most likely just getting it's powers in short concentrated bursts
But that was explained, though.
Yes, exactly.
I like the idea of ley lines running under Equestria.
my god ur sooooo nerdy :D!
indeed
no offense of course :)
And as for the pegasus, it was just better than Scootaloo.
:(
poor scootalooo
SCOOOTALOOOOO!!!!!
wat
none taken I enjoy my nerdness
(im quoting myself)
I feel all twilight sparkley
confound that real life
Twilight is my favourite pony.
Phase4: That old MMO?
yeah, its full of bugs
wut?
wut MMO?
I have no idea why that God company decided to give players the ability to change the game.
See where that led it.
I'm...lost
yeah me tooo
You know, that old MMORPG made titled "Real Life".
and the pricing, dont get me started on the pricing
nope not that hardcore of a gamer
never heard bout that
Oh, Goddesses.
Goddess?
Like Elune?
It's also a pain that you can only make one character, and when this character dies, it's game over.
Pere Lune!
KetaminaDianePie: No, like Celestia and Luna.
But yeah, Elune is cool too.
what do you guys think so far?
http://i.imgur.com/brA0G.png
hmmmmmmmmmm
its the same pose as the pony creator.......
well I planned on making more poses >.>
KetaminaDianePie: You can pose in the pony creator.
but GOGOGO!
i know u silly
@_@
I like it!
Yeah, me too.
is anything playing?
I just wish I could get the Luna-damned neck right when I try drawing ponies.
nope
BewareOfRabbit: Nope, but avÃª anyway.
code lyoko was on lastnight
or day
...I seriously need a keyboard with support for Latin accents.
depending on your location
well.. I could change the pose from where I am in progress.
give me a few~
one minor update to it :p
people are starnge
strange'
verry strange
Phase4: People?
ponies'
like us?
whoops
'People' as in that surprise demographic Equestrian Innovations picked up?
btw i want to see yours too Phase4 and HeavyMetalDash!
KetaminaDianePie: my what?

Dans mon quartier il y a beaucoup de maisons, beaucoup de magasins et des restaurants et des cafÃ©s. Dans mon quartier on peut visiter le parc, au peut aller au cinÃ©ma et on peut aller Ã  la piscine. En Ã©tÃ© il fait assez chaud, mais il pleut parfois, que je n'aime pas.

Did a little modifacations and started to trim the lines, what do you guys thinks. :3
http://i.imgur.com/pi0ej.png
ScootaChicken: i could upload it to dropbox if you want
and I'm too lazy to change the proxy
don't worry Phase4 I've already seen your OC
yaaaay Dashie_Dashie!
its looking good
GOGOGO!
you guys and your ability to draw...
ScootaChicken: i ment the pony creator, if you want to use it
oh right
nah its fine
/me has zero ability to draw
my ability to draw is... lacking to say the least
im quite good at draw...........
but im soooo fckn LAAAAZY!
Sure ScootaChicken ~
I recommend the LordCelestia one
there we go
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
saaaaved!

I love how the Iris chat doesn't have any giant images of ponies emblazoned everywhere
it makes using this at school so much easier
:):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):) << this chat has a serious lack of little twilight faces, fixing
Lol ScootaChicken. Shouldn't you be learning somethin right now.
:$:$:$:$:$:$:$:$:$:$:$:$:$:$:$:$:$:$:$:$:$:$:$
owww right lets troll the neighbourgs with some pony music
eenope Starflash.
its meant to be PE but I injured myself
OH ok. o_O
i would do shy but we only have sadshy and rageshy
so I can just fuck around on the computers for however long I want to
well, until lunch
ScootaChicken: silly, chickens cant do pe
us chickens are awesome at PE
OF course they can. They do so much running that they keep on goin when they die.
our long jump abilities are unrivaled
have you ever seen a chicken run? we had one here for a while and the dog chased it around for a bit
poor thing was scared shitless but it looked so funny
somewhat related, Chicken Run is a great film
^
we should watch it here sometime
have that on vhs
yay! vhs
same Phase4
I love VHS
except that one time when I got that really creepy tape 6 days ago that said I would die in 7 days
meh, bluray's are better
eh, probably just a prank or something
probably
brb, there's a girl coming towards me out of my computer screen
have fun
i heard of that one ScootaChicken. Make sure you tape yourself, those deaths tend to be really violent and off-the-map weird
:O?
eh, I gave it to someone I don't like
ScootaChicken NOOOOOO!!!!!
hahahahaahahaha
ScootaChicken: what kind of provider is that?
nido, London Grid for Learning URL filtering
also, DA has "web chat"?
had to tiolet, did i miss much?
its what our school uses
toilet'
nido: the comments probably count
its a shitty filter if its letting this through
it really is
plus until about a couple weeks ago there was a really easy workaround
Phase4: url filtering generally only works over port 80
thats why its shitty
change your dns and BAM, problem solved
my tafe had the "right" kind of filter wich was a cacheing proxy betwene the internal network and the internet
I've seen a lot of those filtering 'proxies' just hijaching any traffic on port 80, and filtering the GET comments
off to lunch guys
bye
caching'
later ScootaChicken
commands
i was just wondering about eqd
/me yawns his way back into existance
nido: never seen a transparent filter here, only been on two filtered networks though
ohai MakerDusk
cya ScootaChicken!
heya Phase4
today will not be kind to me
way too tired
Hi everyone
ah, hate those days
hi Ninjapony
hello Ninjapony
/me waves at Phase4 and MakerDusk
I hope this tea revives me
hmm, i head a ding but my chat is dead
brb
was too tired to fill sugar, so I just put maple syrup in it
Ohai Ninjapony~
my chat died, what was that message i missed?
/me is half busy playing some games.
Phase4: I've seen a lot of them. But transparent filters usually tend to be... transparent
/me waves at Starflash and Phase4 again
I was just waving at you ^^
lgfl's url filtering seems to be of the sam ekind
/me glances up and then looks away again.
nido: ah, i see what you meen now. not sure how to get around those on vhost sites but using the ip address probably breaks them
i made an oc http://dl.dropbox.com/u/51948537/Screenshot%20-%20260112%20-%2023%3A32%3A36.png :3
Oooh, quite cool Phase
well done
/me must learn to draw at some point in the future
pony creator is good for now though
still needs a cutiemark though
Phase4: you know how transparent proxies work, right?
lol, I know the feeling, Phase4
Woo, new episode of DBZ Abridged
:OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
!cd
Episode 15 of season 2 "The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000" airs in 2 days, 1 hours, 55 minutes, 17 seconds (Jan 28 2012 15:00:00 GMT)
yes
nido: hijack connections with a destination port of 80 and redirect them to a proxy
so close, yet still so far...
well, not so much hijack as lie
Phase4: exactly. So your requests send directly to the ip addresses will also be forwarded to the proxy
(and hence also filtered)
yes but it filters based on the host parameter
so if the hostname is the ip, unless thats filtered it should work
wont help on vhosts but will for some sites
anyways, off to work with me
'later
there's some truth in that
but the easiest to circumvent is to just VPN out to somewhere else; assuming traffic on other ports then port 80 is possible
yeah, i got past my high schools proxy with an ssh connection
my tafe's proxy allowd ping packets through so i could have set a tunnel up using that, couldnt be stuffed though
what's a tafe, if i may ask?
'technical and further education', betwene high school and uni, australian education system whatnot
somewhat like collage from what i've read, but with a greater focus on trades
/me has no idea what to name his oc
allso my chat died again
nope, got better
It's all trimmed up and ready for coloring :3
http://i.imgur.com/HCYRD.png
neat
Not bad for using ms paint though. =p
Hello everyone.
ohai Ouroboros
Dashie_Dashie: its excelent for mspaint
Hai Ouroboros
hai Ouroboros
gahh I have a headache from concentrating so long @_@
Gonna go to bed in a bit
I hope you feel better for a rest.
Have a nice rest Dashie_Dashie
this may seem like a strange question but does my oc look a little fat http://dl.dropbox.com/u/51948537/oc.png
/me killed the chat with his strange question
Nnope
Im hardly an expert, but not particularly.
I think it looks lovely

It's always so meh here.
you see otakon17, you aren't dealing with the average chatter anymore
The weather is so gray all the time.

So I just found out that you can go on YouTube and ask the President some questions.
slowpoke.png
I just finished a pencil sketch of myself Ponified
I wonder why he hasn't been spammed with ACTA questions yet.
Ooh, may we see it?
Let's see it HMD :3
Kammerjunk - because they seem to have made a good point of NOT letting people know about ACTA
I want to see it too.
in a sec I have no scanner so I have too make due with craptastic pics
MirrorImage: Fair point.
and I'll show you all the half finished one of mine.
even though some of you have seen it but others havent :p
MS Paint OC pony is best pony. :3
http://i.imgur.com/YSaCl.png
That's notso bad.
alright this is my second attempt at any sort of pony related art so It's not my best work but here
Pretty B/A Heavy :o
thanks
Ooh, that's cool HMD!
Thinking of a name and a cutie mark for your OC pony is the hardest..
testing a different IRC client. someone ping me real quick
MirrorImage:
good morning guys :)
Hai there TOY_PON3
07,01Such a sad day..
Morning TOY_PON3
hey MirrorImage
How come Lulu ?
and what's wrong Lulu?
07,01EU signed ACTA
07,01https://www.accessnow.org/page/s/just-say-no-to-acta
did???
No way :O
That's not good at all.
07,01so sign the petition.. I beg you
will do
07,01if this thing passes we will be gone
DDDDDDDD:
07,01heck.. the entire online community will be gone
07,01EqD
07,01Facebook
07,01Twitter
07,01Youtube
I've already already signed a Petition, even though I'm from the US.
Meh, I'll just get a life.
It'll be good for me.
but hell.. ACTA could get us too.
07,01ACTA is global
07,01it does not matter where you come from
07,01+ it already passed in the US & Canada last year
ACTA is a treaty - it only has powers in nations that sign it
which, unfortunately, is a lot of nations
Liivate: got a link on that?
The governments not really smart.. you take something away people need/use everyday... there will be repercussions
and signed
yeah... though i think we might have easier success with ACTA now that people have seen that whining and complaining on the internet *works*
Lulu: got a link on that acta signing?
gosh who thinks up of this total bullshit?
<--
I just signed the petition
TOY_PON3 - politicians out of touch with reality and companies who propose them only for the money
Not you Dashie_Dashie you're cool
oh I totally mis read that hahaha
this is why we can't have good things! :'(
I though you said "who thinks this is total bullshit" @_@
Must finish OC Pony before it's too late D:
well meant to say come up
TOY_PON3: government people in secret meetings with RIAA and MPAA people
you can do it Dashie_Dashie!
Dashie_Dashie: too late?
alright lets do this thing does your OC have any sort of backstory at all?
No name needs to get finished today D:
http://i.imgur.com/YSaCl.png
das no name
looks nice Dashie_Dashie
what's his color scheme going to be? i can already recognize a two-tone mane and tail
<-- MS paint pro.
Lime green, and black mane and tail.
kinda like Viynl scratches colors, cept with green.
vinyl*
you know..something tells me this "ACTA" will not be passed..then again I cannot predict the future
I just need a name and a cutie mark idear >.>
what would it's special talent be?
my talent is vidya game but that's totally overused.
ehh... Beerpong? XD
and Dashie_Dashie I'm planning to make two pictures of my OC pony, one drawn and other on computer
I liked those three freckles it has
lol
alright, more IRC testing. someone ping me again
MirrorImage:
MirrorImage
MirrorImage:
MirrorPicture:
. . .Wait a minute.
/me figures the petition only needs 200,000 people to sign it and they're pretty close to it so there shouldn't be any worries
40,000 signs left.
something cool like that
hmmm...
how about Dashie_Dashie? that's a cool name :D
lol
x3
more testing! hit me again
http://i40.tinypic.com/283ta8.png Derpy has gone super sayian.
MirrorImage
meh... close enough i suppose
sorry if i didn't help :(
nah, it's all settings here
oh okay then
i didn't realize Trillian had an IRC client in it, so now i'm trying to give it some level of functionality that the ponychat client did
specifically, a audible ping when someone says my name
at the moment, all i've got it doing is highlighting my name
well I'ma head off for about 45 mins to an hour
madre needs the computer.
laterz Dashie good luck with you're OC
Be back soon.
Thanks. :p
this'll give me time to scetch a cutie mark on paper, and decide what my talents are
but bbl Ladies and Gentlecolts
is he an OC or a self-insert?
...nevermind
http://i40.tinypic.com/1zvu2cx.png Pinkie is gypsie.
there's...something right about that
That picture made me think of this song. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=682pneYoP0c

Morning guys
......
/)3O3(\
lol awesome
/me located a secretr cache! cache is locked, use key? Y/N
Y
?
/me pressed Y, you unlocked a cache of plot.
dat plot!
...it's beautiful
I now only ever open caches for the plot
I watch MLP for the plot. :D
05i dont
Y U watch Wrek?
HeavyMetalDash: It's a joke. :P
05cause' of the flank
^
I know
dat change of terms
also, morning Wrek|Observing
lol
05>morning
05>its 17:10
05>mfw
well
it's morning where I am
same
how you feeling today o wrecker of bums
dat flank
Good morning Wrek c:
"Sir! Sir!" "..What?" "Sir, what was your greatest challenge in life?" "...The 'no ponies' rule."
05i slept really well, i woke up early and had a nice shower n shave, feelin' all fresh i had an awesome breakfast. on my way to the bus i took a very satisfying smoke. i began at 9:30 so i had alot more time than usual. and as i round off to the road hosting the bus stop i see my awesome morning shattered as the bus leaves withotu me, 2 minutes earlier than it should be. leaving me and
5my 100% attendence shattered.
oh no
05which was sad cause i arrived 20 minutes late to class, and we were discussign the broke polotical system of a certain country i will nto name unless asked to
05which i find itneresting
/me asks Wrek what country it was
05the US of A
Sweet. :o
orc
lol
I mean ofc
05anyoen of you from the us?
I am.
I am
05explain what a radical is and how they are looked upon please.
ummm
usually badly
A radical is someone who takes an idea to the extreme.
and me thinks a radical is someone against the current government
05the way my teacher described it, you could put the "radical" tag on anyone within the swe political system.
not really
none of them are radical
Radicals don't have to be political.
in the good version or the "we must change the government" way
A radical can be anything.
Like a feminist, or an anarchist, or even a chocolate milk fanatic.
05ill tyr to clarify
05seen from the us politicians used as a degradign term
05not all ofc
05but thats beside the point
05but yeah anyways
05to lighten the mood

Ip Man is best pony
Wrek: You are awakened by a sudden realization; "Someone is using my toilet!"
Wrek, you seem to like Twilight
dat puppy
Wrek: As you inspect the situation, you notice your toilet is barren of physical entities.
Wrek: You go back to bed.
And everything went better than expected.

05pfft

xcanox: the internet was MADE to insult people.
05you aint got shit
Hmm..
Military made it so they could tell greg in accounting to eat a dick.

05eeyup

Wrek: gets ALL the Stallions.
05lsitenign to a podcast

05but i could art anyways
DinkyHooves: unfortunately
05if you guys are OK with that
hells yea
0,5Oh
0,5Oh!
05RAWRity, I get all the fillies n the colts
I still can't believe Jonah Hill is nominated for a fucking Oscar
any other artists in here?
0,5How about the LC picture you never finished? :>
yo

00,10oh we oh we oh!

RAWRity: chillax man, just breath!
05suddenly Sumica and Flaria
00,10oi hi

kevinsano: well, Shy has a account as well, she's another resident scribbler
/me hugs Flaria
kevinsano: there be hugs he, don't worry.
'cause you're awesome, thats why
otakon: no. Fuck that. Jonah Hill is at BEST an average actor. There were tons of other actors that deserved that spot, and Hill got in because he was in Moneyball. that's it.
Hey Wrek, what do you think of my first OC pony (Done in MS Paint)?
http://i.imgur.com/GcgOK.png
/me hugs LordCelestia
05loose the beard
Needs to be about 20% color.
.....
05slank up a liiiiittle bit
and what did he do in moneyball? He played the same character he does in every other movie, but made fewer dick jokes.
05and buy a comb
05and i'd totally do you
/me bricks xcanox
:3
otakon: y u mad tho?
lol
00,10slank it up.....that's a new one on me.
xcanox: no, it's just I expected SOMEONE to say that
otakon: oic
Me too Sumica.. me too.
Can we make like a Disney movie week. We can show the old ones that aren't as well known
dem slender ponies
otakon: Did you expect "color" or "cooler" cuz there's a difference!
otakon: who is Shy
man everything needs to be about 20% cooler
Fluttershy`. Resident around here
kevinsano: a Mod but she's not here atm
ah, okies
Like Bedknobs and Broomsticks, The Black Cauldron, The Sword in the Stone, etc.
00,10not well known disney? no such thing.
yeah
agreed
The Black Cauldron was pretty good
DinkyHooves sounds like a pretty neat idea
05there are 3 movies i want to see here at bronystate
very dark
Black Cauldron is fun
wassat Wrek?
The Great Mouse Detective was one
wth
yeah
00,10must be
I liked the Great Mouse Detective
05Sunshine, Anastasia and Law Abiding Citizen
ooooh
Wrek: wtf
that last one I want to see too
"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close" gets a 44% on RT, yet it gets a fucking Best Picture nom, while Drive and The Ides Of March are almost completely ignored.
Wrek: What about Remember The Titans?
Law Abiding Citizen wasn't that great
Wrek: Or Back To The Future?
05nope
Wrek: Or The Karate Kid?
05though Titan A.E would be awesoem too
Dat Totalbiscut.
titan A.E is win
00,10plot pirates 7 wrek?
but...Anastasia and Law Abiding Citizen sucked...
RAWRity: relax! you can't do anything about it, so stop giving yourself a heartattack
Wrek: Or that pony movie that doesn't exsist yet?
aww I remember that pic
Stream :)
Anastasia wasn't that bad
No! I got it!
Wrek: War Horse
otakon: I'm not giving myself a heart attack, I'm calling it out as bullshit.
anyone here going to bronycon by any chance?
I wish I could
we should show the NEVERENDING Story 1
I wish I could go to Bronycon but I can't.
but my finances are in the air atm
Neverending Story 1.......
I'll be there...in spirit
DinkyHooves: so very much. that was a GREAT movie!

Rescuers Down Under <3

Watch those spoilers man!

TrixieMuffin: too much
Those aren't spoilers.
I still frequent /b/ because of gems in the rough, and I haven't seen any planned raids on anything.
and it's NOT spoilers!
That's common knowledge rightr now.
Who's to say a newpony isn't in here, huh?!
/me wants to go hunting for blindbags but is also interested in awesome art happening now
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\: Nice name.
oh well, I'll be going now
xcanox: With that logic, we can never mention any fact from the show.
05so yeah
You should know this by now.
05drawing berry
Do you even watch the show?
in that case "pony" would be a spoiler in itself
/me feels a name-change coming on.
See you, kevinsano.
BioShock is great

Bye
BioShock is alright.
I like that idea
if I remember how I got here, lol
ValÃª, kevinsano.
Rainbow Dash merch? Do want! :o
Oo, pony crackers
Bioshock is real neat-o.
I don't have enough money to buy all this merch.
When I first played Bioshock it was the dead of night and home alone, creeped me out way too muh
But I still play it now
Bioshock is easily creepy if you're in the right mood
Shame on ya, ya should know kevinsano

I love that guy.
Ninja Gaider... *shivers*
Yes!! Woot drawing!! Wrek is streaming i take it?
So who is TB talking to asides from Jessy Cox?

Daaaaaark Soooooooooouls.

yes, but the laundromat makes your laundry done *now*

I just wear something else meanwhile.
nuuuu! I farted
i am banned.
hi
Cello
can somebody help me
oh that's what i do basically too Kammerjunk
I wish I had a Rainbow Dash shirt. That'd make me so happy.
Pony shirts have to be washed separately, though, and much colder.
Also, preferably with the shirt inverted.
is that supposed to be a 20% cooler reference?
gz @canox
nice
oh god... they're talking about tvtropes?
a RD shirt wash by hand is 20% cooler like with a machine
MFW I'm looking at the trope TB is reading.
Nice hat.
Got a specific trigger that sends you into a bloodthursting rage? There's a Trope for that.
berserkerbutton?
Lordkane: Yup.
dem nuts
dat promotion
Nuts Of DESTRUCTION!
Whelp ima go buy my first ever blindbags at my local wallmart then settle down with art and guitar for the day Bai everypony

Ron Paul as a zombie......
I say, that is a long trailer.
RaveBrony: And stories, and theme packs, and other stuff.
Basically, if you made it, you can post it there.
Cool :o i guess ill make one...
Fun fact : Zombification multipies ! Theres allways more Zombies than there were Humans to convert in the first place
Maybe zombies split themselves into two identical copies, like bacteria
Tom is gone, long live the Tom!
fun fact - zombies are Namekian / Yoshis
Tom will always live on......

Gentlemen... Behold!

Anybody awake?
Hey.
Hey dude.
I didn't expect you to be here. Aren't you always signed in?
So I'm told that ACTA got signed by the EU.
Yeah, Simon -would- be all over this game.
And yeah, I am.
WHAT?
00,10loved that game
ACTA got signed?
I see a silhouette of a Fluttershy.
Yeah, US had already signed it, but I was told the the EU just did too.
Damn.
The Internet is screwed.
bbl
class in two minutes
See you, Fl-
Aww.
TBH I think it's going to fail miserably. Where are all the millions needed to fund ACTA going to come from?
/me hugs Flaria
Too slow.....
The government, putting itself on more debt.
>Voice recognition
It would require the ISPs to spend so much money setting up everything to support ACTA too.
Lolno.
I really wish I was as good as Wrek .___.
Someone's going to end up shooting someone.
sane....
I see Kinect hitting its peak in 2013
I would not play an FPS with voice recognition.
*Same
Then going downhill from there
Dashie_Dashie, have you worked on any drawings?
The ISPs aren't going to want to pay for that.
What if you have a cold while playing?
"Snubmacheengun"
What if you're actually not the only person in the room?
http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/01/26/meet-sopas-evil-twin-acta/
I'm working on one right now..
you couldn't just use A HEADSET!?
not nearly as good as him though
What if someone is trying to sleep?
"ACTA is a confusing mess. Even its signatories don't agree on how it's supposed to work."
a HEADSET would WORK!
but their only 20 bucks
Upwards of 70,000 people were protesting in Poland
But if your Kinect is in your living room, ME3 would go to hell unless you live alone.
I personally like Kinect more for its professional applications compared to games
i would play doom on kinect if it registered me saying "big fucking gun"
Robomorons: That sounds interesting, actually.
Yeah, I read that. Dang, even in Poland? That's crazy.
LOL
If I could yell at my teammates and they would react differently, I would so play it.
Hey, they could make it in Japan, so why not?
Im working on two myself, Dashie_Dashie....hows yours coming along?
Buy a gun before bullets are banned all over the world. Buy gas before gas is banned. XD
LunaTheBeloved: Exactly.
making some adjustments, filling in some solid lining to give it it's boldness..
again.. amature compared to Wrek >_>
a stealth game with kinect
00,10Shizuschlafen came out so prity
A stealth game with kinect would hurt from crouching so much.
Dashie_Dashie: Well, Wrek spends like, every awake hour drawing.
Or close enough to, anyway.
she did
berry punch at a strip club?
Im only drawing an outline and want to make adjustments if i can get it onto the computer...
They actually managed to make something over in Japan that would hate you if you talked bad to it.
really?
that's actually neat
but I can never stand to be evil even to npc's usually
Some guy also made a completely clone of himself, complete with dead eyes.
I cant get a top hat right on my Canterlot worthy pony....
but
Hiroshi Ishiguro, he's called.
I like Male Shepards voice
I don't like Jennifer Hale's worth though I'm afraid
Oh, wait.
No, it wasn't even in Japan.
He's called Jules, made by Hanson Robotics.
Alright guys I'm gonna go and get so lunch
I'll bbl
Bye LunaTheBeloved, take care and enjoy
Have fun, LunaTheBeloved.
Food Fun!!
And I'm going to go eat dinner.
Enjoy Kammerjunk|DINNAH
Wrek, how much does this program cost?
Watching Wrek draw, listening to the beatles, and a bit of drinking is Amazing<3
/me is still at work and wishes he could do the last part..
Oh ponies, you've done it again!
okay, brb need a drink and noms
Noo! Stupid Ad!!
05around 500$
00,10embrace the ABP cy'
8,1i managed to convince my mother that the yellow part of a lemon meringue pie was made with the yolks of the eggs used in the meringue
xD
Daaang, lol. Any cheaper programs? xD
RaveBrony: Not really....
8,1what program is it?
There are but not a whole lot of em.
"You enraged me so much I threatened an infant!!!"
Darn, guess ill have to perfect my drawing before it goes on the computer xD
8,1wait, that's just illustrator
8,1RaveBrony: use InkScape
8,1it's free
Woah wait! Is this Seriously Berry Punch at a strip club!?!?1 Roflmao!
8,1RaveBrony: also, for non-vector stuff, Paint Tool SAI is very cheap
inb4 someone suggesting to download Ai from rapidshare
RaveBrony: It just depends what your good with. I have friends who are amazing with even Microsoft Paint. Just depends how you use each program.
RaveBrony, yes but my concern is who is on the pole...
Not sure if leg...
yeah... exactly
8,1Radu: also, there's GIMP if you want to go the free software root
8,1but that's not for vectors either
I see
8,1vectors: inkscape, non-vectors: gimp
Oh, very cool. Ty :o
there's also Paint.NET that i use rather than GIMP
00,10are they argueing the merrents of demos?
What's up with that user named _____________ ?
8,1(though imo, paint tool sai is better for painting than gimp, and is well worth the money)
Radu - don't know, but it's separating the Ops/HOps/Voiced users from the normal users
8,1and, of course, gimp and inkscape have the advantage of being cross-platform
Not bad.
Do they have paint. net for Win 7?
8,1thoguh i think you can run Paint Tool SAI under WINE
Ill look up inkScape too :o
Paint.NET uses the .NET Framework
8,1anyhoos, that's probably not even relevant to you
so as long as Windows 7 still uses .NET, it should work
hello everypony
8,1as you almost certainly use Windows
Hai FluttershyOHYEAH11
00,10I dont aggrey with this, I would have never bought Skyrim had I not pirated it first.

00,10ohmy
8,1i should get DCD to stream my commission
How much does a graphics tablet cost?
Wait, Wrek is drawing a mare, at a mare strip club, right?o__________o
yep
Radu - Berry Punch specifically
8,1as you almost certainly use Windowsdon't bother with a crappy Trust tablet or similar, save up for a nice Wacom one
00,10yes Radu, and depends on how big a tablit you get.
Dat Berry punch likes her mares
i almost want to suggest putting Trixie on the pole though
I thought it was her, I didn't want to make a confusion
:o
O U Sumica
8,1ignore the first part of that sentence
8,1but yeah, Trust are horrible; they're cheap, but you get what you pay for
Berry Punch is drinking a punch. Is it a berry-kind of punch?
00,10Forexample you can spend 2grand on a tablet.
00,10but it's as big as a screen
Carrot Top should be on the pole
again, Trixie should be on the pole
xD^
8,1you can get a wacom bamboo for abotu $70, it hink
Ill start looking up this stuff. So paint. net, Paint Tool SAI and inkScape :o
but that's up to Wrek ultimately anyways
Trixie is such a great pony
I use Paint.NET, it's good tbh
..."Fluffy Puppies?"
/me googles
...not relevant google search
/me wishes he had his guitar with him at work to work on his other job... D:
Alright, let's start a poll. Who is the next background character to get voice?
Octavia / Vinyl
inb4lotsof none
one or the other or, ideally, both
I say Lyra
I say Vinyl..well, i want Vinyl, lol
this is so wrong on SO many levels
What's wrong, otakon?D:
Hmm, my say is for Octavia
and not a single care was given that day otakon
eeyup
lol!!
Nothing is wrong with this otakon :3
<------ Berry Punch is expecting a Berry Punch answer
I want Vinyl to get some lines, but I would have to say Octavia would get one before Vinyl
Does Dinky have a voice?
don't think so
05nom pea soup with pork n mustard n spices
then i say dinky
:o
nice Wrek
Octavia sounds like a good next background pony voiced
Nice stuff you got there, pal
wb FluttershyOHYEAH11
Sounds fancEY
Also, hopefully Bon-Bon gets a 'set' voice, haha
You know, I bet people get made because Trollestia trolls them. I bet if Trollestia didn't troll them, people woodknot get made.
Same with Doctor WHooves
yeah... Bon-Bon has had 3 different voices so far?
Yep^
"people get *made*"
Honestly, I think Hasbro did the voice for Derpy cause she was fan-favourite. The second fan-favourite, I think, is VERY far away
Trollestia is the STork
The doll, the bag, and talking to rarity
<3 Derpy
Radu, i totally agree
Ohai Dari
Hey
Radu - probably, but it'd also be easier on resources to recycle a background pony and give her a specific role
13morning dari
dat stripper pony
than it would be to create an entirely new one, if it can avoided
Afternoon. :P
00,10Oh hidari and Shizuka
hey dari~
Hai Dari
Good afternoon, Dari
Heh, hey
Fan favourite basically means "Look out for ______ during the episode!"
13totalbiscuit and... who else is on stream audio?
OH man! I didn't notice the pony behind Berry

Hello.

Sigh... my internet won't let me look at any picture links
but they don't normally wear clothes
so
they put them on?
lol! very true^
wat
So, it's a Get Dressed club?
00,10not in wreks g5
the secret life of Berry Punch...
xD
So has anypony here seen Quarantine 2?
So it's a club where they put on fancy hats and clothing
oh don't worry
so, the MORE clothes a pony wears the more indecent she is?
just accidently typing my password in this chat
that means Rarity is a strumpet!
I guess
Well, they dress up for parties though
I don't think so, why did the mane 6 came in clothes at the gala, then?
Oh, okay.
Have fun with that, then.
Already did~
Let's just say that Ponyville is a nudist colony and leave it at that.
00,10exactly the partys are for swingers
because it's really a Sexy Party
Or maybe, that put on barely any clothes for teasing? who knows
13silly ehren, this is why you always type passwords on the system messages page, and *never* in a channel
What have I done!
my MIND!
xD
Holy bit, TB is still talking?
I should draw a picture for my friend since its his birthday tommorow
I can't hear anything
oh thats why
Why would TB want to go back to WoW?
13i recognize totalbiscuit but who else is talking?
what am i hearing?
guess my LootaChicken will have to wait
holy moses!
Biscuit is best British guy.
no Aloe and Lotus too?
Hey Shizuka. What pony do you like the most?
Vi, that is.
13^ easy question
Tohohoh.
Dat mane <3
Sea ponies!
Seaponies are real neat-o.
thats really neat looking
THats an awesome pic :o
Hippocampus Fluttershy
I play WoW because private RPing servers are silly.
its not like 10000 people don't know my password for everything anyway~
Awesome mane done right there, Wrek <3
Ooh.
I wonder who Berry is with.
never played WoW. i was a runescape kid
Mabye I'll change eet if my accounts ever become worth something
^
I need hot sauce for my navy bean soup
unlikely
I didn't like WoW
I played Runescape.
For 5 minutes.
also, that stripper pole cutie mark...
Is that a Portal 2 cutie mark?
I was both a RuneScape and WoW kid
her parents must have been so proud
Oh, mfw
I really like her /mane/!
Radu: Now you're thinking with ponies.
RaveBrony: *points to the door*
xD
lol!!
the other one is a dollar bill
I thinnk
Hey, I play WoW and EVE at the same time.
Kammerjunk: your insane
l
I'm criminally insane-sane-sane-sane.
Nope sorry Kammer
lol
Anyone here played Club Penguin?
Wait, what?!
I think thats me
enope
your just... insane
Whos the two mares hanging off of Berry there?
Im gonna look up RuneScape now, lol :o
pfft runescape
want my account rave?
yeah, i stopped playing runescape 6 months ago
I'm purely psychosomatic.
it's starting to become too commercial now
as evidenced by the "Get a free set of Goggles by playing the game on Google Chrome"
Sure, lol. Is it useful?
I quit Runescape 4 years ago
no
like 6 years ago
8,1Kammerjunk: i think it's adorable
I quit when I was 9
so 7 years
huuzah
I'm not sure what I think, but I feel bad for Fluttershy anyway.
I haven't touched RS in /years/
Poor mare.
[wub]ehren - ah, so you were a Classic player
Woah, well th is has changed wuite a bit! O_o
*quite
MirrorImage eeyup
brb
I tried Runescape some years back.
I still prefer it back in classic
Do not want. No siree Bob.

MirrorImage: I am jelly.
My cat is at my grandma 'till tomorrow.
Lol!! That pic xD
I love his drawings :D
Is that a pole cutie mark?
it is
You bet'cha
well that is something Discord would do
again, her parents must've been proud
What is your life like as a filly when you have a pole cutie mark?? Lol!
"Mama! Daddy! Look, I got my cutie mark!"
"...how did you get that mark?"
Hahahha xD
lol!

I like the guy named ____________________. He appeases my need for organising by serving as a divider between all the mods and everypony else.
if you managed to get it
He'd have to go to the other kind of clubs
:D
Lol, Sumica :P
/me throws wub at Kammerjunk
/me from the other side of the _________
/me is hit by wub.
Ow.
Kammerjunk: except his FAILING in that duty
and below [wub]ehren
Oh.
who is NOT a mod or techie
Not on my client.
thus EPIC FAIL
On my client, he's at the top of non-mods.
00,10clealy we need to rename ________ to [________] so we can get [wub]ehren out
I am appeased.

D'aww
Sumica I'm not limited by a username either you know =P
a'www
Derpy is a silly filly
00,10if we could rename him we could rename you =p
[wub]ehren: I got no strings to hold me down!
To make me sad, and make me wrong.
I just got here... errr. am I listening to an interview or something?
Sundaysmile: Yup.
yeye
Podcast
We're listening to TotalBiscuit, OMFGCata, Gunns4Hire and Dodger.
I think.
I'm not so sure about Dodger there.
ah
00,10Sounds like they are talking about Dust 315
I remember that gaem
I was extremely excited about that game.
didn't it die?
Wrek! I am copying this stuff as you go on, is this ok? (its for understanding, lol)
But then I saw it was solely for PS3.
Eve?
Then I raged.
00,10Yeah eve online themed fps
Sundaysmile: EVE Online is a space MMO.
I know
ohokay
I thought someone said it was dying off?
It's very fun.
00,10the groud based gaming could effect the space empires
BRB, dogs are barking at door.
I am the pony who hands out the wub
the beat rains on me from up above.
Wrek, what part do you start with??
Yup. Dogs were just barking at the doorl.
door*
00,10the rage thing was vause eve gamers spend a ton of time seting up empires
00,10they dont want that to be effected by ground pounders
gods
I don't get EVE
/me unleashes wave 1 of the wub
it's bucking WORK
It's amazing how CCP succeeded to make their own currency.
AKA, PLEX.
there is NO enjoyment in it
okay
Ask any lawyer, they'll say their job is quite fun.
I can see how making your own company seems good
I don't find any fun in EVE either otakon
but for gods sake
it's a bloody battlefield
8,1http://i.imgur.com/aORF5.jpg
backstabbers everywhere!
That's the fun of it!
So many adorable pictures! :)
00,10I enjoyed eve way back when, but the death penilty changed it.
Kammerjunk: not when it's REAL stuff you worked for
"Kuunami"
00,10When you are flying a few billion isk worth of shit it becoems stressful
O_o
Sumica: Well, don't fly a few billion ISK alone.
especially when you run into gate pirates
So cuuute ;)
and i'm not only referring to the position of the tail
Did you know that in EVE, a corp managed to infiltrate another corp and one of them even became co-CEO?
They then took all their money, killed the CEO and flew off into the sunset.
In space.
00,10Thre is no safty in numbers
was that a discordshy?
yes it was
and there are MORE
I want one
Draconequis Mane 6
But seriously.
00,10and for the record you cant fly the ship I used alot alone. I was always in a taskforce
dat Plant vs Zombies sound
00,100.0space is still stressful
indeed
WHY would CCP make Dust 514 only for PS3?
Kammerjunk: eeyup and bought a super powerful ship and put a BOUNTY on his own head for the lulz
even if you're in a CEO there is too much backstabbing and bickering
Kammerjunk: trying to attract more users
The PC players made EVE what it is.
sorry corp :P
otakon: Yeah, that was hilarious.
Seriously, I love it when stuff like this happens.
I love virtual corruption.
Kammerjunk: all the EVEr's have EVE already, they are trying to attract more players
Real life corruption is bad, though.
granted it's not bad
they see the PS3 group as a untapped customer base
Aha.
05hows dat mane?
I like it
00,10Kammerjunk because no othere system could intigrate with Tranquility server
hello Bronystate
00,10wild mane there wrek
Sumica: Or because Microsoft are too silly not to?
i really like her mane
^
I like that mane.
so, we got a name for her?
00,10same thing realy Kammerjunk
or did he get cut off?
Fair point.
Who's played the Birthday Scenario game on EqD?
I think the stream got cut off guys
I haven't been on EQD for two weeks now.

Call in the nerds!

Kammerjunk - "Are you sure that your system is plugged in?"
MirrorImage: That could give Gilda a chance for redemption.
"Are you using your mouse as a foot pedal?"
Kammerjunk - check the chart again and catch the joke
/me begins a stopwatch
MirrorImage: ...
What chart?
there is goes

Oh..

Nope.

one of the exotic ponies clinging on BP
Kammerjunk - what would your Birthday hvae to be to get "Switch Bodies with Gilda?"
/me "Switched bodies with Mayor Mare"
MirrorImage: February the 30th.
become a gold digger?
/me started a business with Rarity
My birthday scenario is just "Violated Princess Celestia" which, seeing her more twisted fandom version, is pretty ironic and terrifying.
/me 's Battle Clones of Pinkie Pie begin to take over the world
"Started a gang with Pinkie Pie"
But that's stupid.
That chart is stupid. You're stupid!

damn it Wrek, stop drawing seductive ponies!
13nein don't stop
So has anypony here ever seen Quarantine 2?
It needs about 20% more plot
13beliiiiievein
this plot will have an epilogue

Oh hi, Gumri.
You like that song, Shizuka?
Hello everyone!
Kammerjunk: isn't that a horrible sequel?
hey gummy
13i saw an opening for a pun und i took it
00,10is't that the flash game Kammerjunk?
Hi Gumri
hiya Gumri
who doesnt like Journey?
05otakon is embarrased that he likes my drawings :3
otakon: That's what I want to know.
Sumica: wat
Wrek: Your drawings are the plot pics, yes?
Wrek: I do like your drawings, you draw well.
00,10I thought there was a flash game with that name
Wait why are they talking?
but DAMN IT so much sauce
Ohohoho. I like Wrek's drawings.
00,10otakon embrace the sausy
it's a saucy drawing
I'm surprised I'm not drunk by now
Sumica: No, it's the sequel to Quarantine.
Wrek - the issue is that when this is what i watch on the stream on a near-daily basis...
more saucy! MOAR SAUCY!
it becomes harder to tell my friends "Yes, my interest in this show is chaste"
MirrorImage: agreed
Mirror. They can tell you're lying
yeah, and finding the proof of it isn't terribly hard
I had a half an hour debate about what is better: nfl or ponies.
8,1MirrorImage: but... sexy ponies!
^
I have all Wrek's drawings saved to a folder which I have linked to on my desktop.
"Hey Mirror, can I use you computer for a minute?"
00,10Clearly you must get them hooked as well then you dont have to explane shit
I have nothing to hide.
10,02Good morning everypony ^_^
Oh hi, SB.
Slept well?
Hi SB
8,1morning sb
hello SB

good evening
8,1SaLKiD99: welcome to the bronystate herd
thank you
apart from the wallpaper, which is a night scene of the mountain Canterlot sits against
dare they click it? yes
so if they're going to call me out on being a brony, they need to be one as well
8,1we're currently watching Wrek draw sexy po nies
SaLKiD99: And remember RawketLawnchair's words of wisdom.
I am very smart.
Yes.
ok
05what words?
How is everypony today anyway?
10,02The morning sun has vanquished the horrible night.
00,10oh god bloody roar, that game was so button mashing
(P.S. : i was going to ask what we were watching...)
8,1Kammerjunk: hey, it's what's on the stream!
8,1
Wrek: "Up is blue, down is lava and clouds taste of butter and tears."
fighting games are bad... except for Guilty Gear and BlazBlue
Wrek: One in the hay is worth two in the plot
Sundaysmile: wat
LOL
sorry Kammer
I don't like any fighting games really. Only because i suck at them though
Don't apologise.
I had a laugh.
05do ask SaLKiD99
10,02You call Super Smash Bros. a bad fighting game?!
hiya SuperBrony64
very impressive drawing , Wrek
"She's yours for the night"
10,02Hai otakon :>
05no need to hold it in
In the words of George Takei, "OOOOH MYYYYY"
ok
/me wubs SuperBrony64
SuperBrony64: it's a GREAT party game, but lousy as a fighting game
umm...
8,1"What happens in Canterlot, stays in your bloodstream for up to 72 hours"
00,10lol wrek you are giveing them so many ideas
SaLKiD99: yes, Wrek draws saucy ponies.
I want some saucy Wrek ponies.
yes he does :)
00,10first they think it's my birthday, now they are bound to think othere things =p
My speakers suck i can't hear the stream properly
10,02Who has been R63'd? :3
Gumri: That's why I got headphones.
you SuperBrony64 and Sumica
what machinima is this?

I have some headphones in the other room as well but im too lazy to get them
No SaLKiD99 im british
10,02I mean, the pony on the stream, who was it originally? :P
Pshhh... I want to see Wrek ATTEMPT to R63 my OC

AvÃª, derpy_pony.
Kammerjunk... yeah I fixed it but I couldn't be bothered to spend 5 seconds reuploading it
I love Illegal Danish.
hi , derpy_pony
:)
10,02That pony is pretty big...taking up more than the dimensions of the page ^_^
Danish is best pastry ever
"Do you know who I am? The slayer of cows! The enchanter of Babylon. The left elbow of Ragnaros! The ice princess!"
pastry?
hm?
even touching the danish will bestow godlike powers onto you
I am... ZINWRATH!
Then who was phone?
I should probably attemt to draw my own OC
it was a wrong number
I don't know what to think about the Danish. You never hear about them. Sneaky people.
and add the cutie mark on
:3
SuperBrony64: You should get a bigger monitor.
10,02O U

my bigger brother made the SaLKiD for the Gamer Tag of XBox 360

0,5I prefer necromancers
that sounded so wrong in my head
maybe i have 99 solutions but a Year ain't one
LordCelestia inb4 Negromancers and otakon being racist :P
please no
why did you have to bring that up?
Hi everypony!
Necromancy is a great tool , mainly because it freaks people out , just as a sideeffect ^^
Hey Hoofy ~
hi Hoofy welcome
hi Hoofy! :)
Because it was the first thing that filled my mind. But you must admit it was pretty amusing discussion otakon.
13i balme sxyparetdner
:) Thanks for all the greetings!
I have to admit that was the first thing that came to mind~
hmm...live stream better than Radio....
poor Saxy, getting blamed for everything
"Hi Hoofy" *Hoofy disconnects*
The ads- they hate me
get adblocker
Ad block~
xD
I have one
*Booting*
or use a non-browser client
13nein nein sxy is not saxy
13sxy ruins everyting, Saxy makes everything better
could you play Rainbow Factory by WoodeenToaster? (not really just asking...after this song if you could)
oh i see Shizuka... then yes it is sxy's fault!
dat bronyquest
Oh, I blame Sxy~
"Bawwing at the Bronies?"
:D I am, getting to lisen to: Bronyquest (No BGM) xD
8,1SaLKiD99: is that anything to do with the fic?
Actually the fan fic was inspired by the song~
lol
Faaaanfictions.
the song is good and creepy, i like it
umm...no just the song...(ok , yes it's a theme song for the fic , sorry :|)
Adrian Brony, Adrian Brony. . .

There's a plugin for Chrome to...
I'm on chrome as well~

MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNN!!!!
oh I remember this game :P
13also if you're going to shotgun mid range, the single shotty is much better

i don't really remember the last time i had a chat like this :)
AGHH THE LAG...
13piss off the archie first
13then let the chaingunners get him
no bfg?
LOL
8,1a sign of things to come? http://www.megaupload.com/
0,5http://megaupload.com/
dat invisible demon
0,5Dat ninja
archviles kick ass
8,1LordCelestia: wow, freaky
i imagine the government had enough evidence against megaupload to take it down apart from SOPA and PIPA, starting a panic will only cause trouble
8,1i just linked it because i was looking at pony vids and one of the downloads was mediafire, and it reminded me of megaupload
SOPA was the worst thing ever!
8,1so i went to check if it was still down
money laundering?
8,1and was greeted by that
0,5I just saw it somewhere else
0,5and thought id bring it here
0,5its
8,1lulz, herdmind
0,5DESTINY
unproven accusations
Oh wow...
yay Wrek
wait , the a slot called BronyState?...
*there's
Your in the slot
LordCelestia: a perfect example of why ICANN shouldn't be in charge of domains
apparently, according to a "birthday party scenario game: pony style!" i stole the elements of harmony with big mac
hmm...what games do Wrek has?...
00,10Wth wrek you go and draw me a present but you dont link me to it? =p
13mfw nukage floor and not damaging
05MASTER OF DODGE
lol, suddenlt CyberDemon
13doomguy is dancing like a ballerina to avoid the nukage
8,1Fleur: i didn't say it was because of either of those. i just think that this kind of seizure is about to become a lot more common.
which laws? megaupload removed illegal material
when i tried to play the Ponified Sceneraio Game , i was born in August 18 , which shows me "Went to the Moon with Scootaloo
just like youtube
8,1also, LordCelestia is turning into me
"
poor scootaloo
lol hax missles
oh , the fun in the Moon...
0,5NUUUU
LOL
8,1just wait, he'll start hitting on guys and spouting inappropriately fetishistic randoms in no time
That would be intresting ...
0,5Oh no i wouldnt dare
/me eyes Shizuka and Wrek
0,5>.>
0,5<.<
13i don't suppose anyone else knows doomsday but can't you hold Alt and one of the arrows to strafe?
not sure if it's Lag , or a Problem with the Stream...or the Buffering
I think this is a no Strafe run~
8,1Shizuka: yup
8,1iirc, you need to put it in the config
haha yearh :D! Doom! Oldschool
13wrek let the chaingunners shoot at you, they'll hit the archie and make him mad
dat megasphere
Hey guys, tell me.. does this need anything more added to it? (besides a background)
http://i.imgur.com/s1Nxc.png
Not so long time ago i heard that this game Was Legalized in Germany hahaha
13you know, being used to modern shooters... the double shot gun has such a painfully long reload time X3
i'm having some problem with stream...sometimes it get's laggy and/or buffers
Daka daka daka.
Back
Lovely colouring Dashie_Dashie :)
needs moar Dakka
Doom, :P
Modern shooters are fun~ But Half life will always remain my all time fav~
as my*
sooo... doesn't it need anymore shading? or is it good?
For shooters...It's gotta be TF2
Because hats.
i wish i could play Team Fortress 2...
It ;ppls good Dashie_Dashie ~
my favorite shooter...
hm...
It lookss*
why can't you SaLKiD99?
looks*
I like cooperative shooters
My favorite shooter was....
Fleur - "Cooperative." HAH
hmm I don't have one
lol that quit message
my favorite shooter would have to be... Borderlands
MirrorImage: L4D
dat crash
Dat swedish windows
Fleur Yes. oh gawd yes.
Fleur: again, HAH
Oh I love L4D~
good luck in random lobbies
Counter strike source ftw :)
my laptop is C**p and slow , and the PC in our house doesn't plays
I hate cars~
L4D is a great game
MirrorImage obviously never played with a team
never heard of marathon before
13hehe hey guys, guys... it's time for a marathon X3
Woo!
yay!
what marathon Shizuka ?
SaLKiD99: what are the specs on your computer? I believe TF2 only asks for a Pentium 4 processor, which means 10-year-old rigs should be doable
Fleur: I have
I thought he actually meant he was going to do a marathon of game streaming~
13wrek ist playing marathon :P
Yes! Five thousand yeses
though my steam friend list totals about 15, and most of them i met on the TF2 Ponyville servers
05had to check difficulty xD
few of them play L4D
he kinda is doing a marathon of games... with marathon 2 lol
13i wonder if wrek would play quake
quake whoo!
well , i think it changed , since i accidentaly deleted windows for trying to reboot it into new
MirrorImage: I played 3 times a week, every week. Each play was with the same people and we always played for 8 hours straight.
Campaign or Versus?
looks old
We got damn good at cooperating
Campaign
Was that the power glove?~
Versus is no fun because people exploit too many glitches
and then my bigger brother (can i say my Brothers' name?) gave it to his friend to add windows 7 back
it has 2 Resolutions , which are very bad
Oh I don't bother with VS~ To many people raging~
I liked the Specops missions in Modernwarfare 2
it has a higher space in the hard drive...
But that is the only thing I liked about that game
it's just a bit slower
what's that sound?
so much nostalgia... i love this place
/me has never played any of these games that wrek streams~
what's that sound?
pewpewpew! Always more pewpewpew
13this engine looks like a strange cross between quake und duke 3d
i'm having a bit "bingbingbing" sound
i was thinking more doom and duke 3d
05its earlier than both
13was it after doom 1?
05same year
and a few days later , the charger doesn't charge anymore
Dooooom.
05I WUB THIS SHOTGUN
:D
Like. A. BAWSS.
who here remembers Brute Force?
all because it turned out that the laptop was fixed by an Indian
i do Fleur
<3
/me doesn't know that game~
marathon 1 was macintosh exclusive...I wonder why they did that
says on the Web that Bungie studioes made this Graphich Engine xD
(you know , we have LOTS of Indians in our Country , usually working)
DubZbrony: Indeed they did~
The game was made by Bungie~
swampmonsters!
Swiming around in that green muck can't be healthy
Didnt they They made this early games, used to hear about halo all the time too so :p thats not strange
im going to get a new Laptop , hopefully , that is very strong
*didnt think they made
macintosh was king before 1995
not really
@SuperBrony64 why does the Stream buffers a bit?
squishy
all of this beatiful goodness now on ichuines, ebay, amazone, napster, limewire, utorrent, and paypal
Tried restarting Web Browser or Refresh Site?
ok, im gonna go for a bit guys... gonna get some excersice, later
ta ta Midnight_Tempest ~
bye Midnight_Tempest
just a moment
/me hugs Midnight_Tempest ~
/me hugs Nyria back
So wgats this game called?
ok im back
RawketLawnchair: Marathon~
marathon 2
Sounds like an odd name for a =rooty tooty point and shooty.
how do u bronies do that think which kind of makes the spelling Italic?
use /me
ok , i'll try
Hes Running alot it seems, to i guess that the reason its called that :S
/me is trying the /me command
/me 13thinks you are succeeding at the /me command
You need to try harder than that~! I want to see that text flat on the ground~!
/me lols
+tn
what should that do :S
[+tn]
just remember SaLKiD99. Dont spam /me (not that you were. Just a friendly warning)
ok
sorry
DubZbrony: every room has +tn
it is what makes them a room ^_^
13back later ponies
ta ta ~
bye Shizu[AFK
come back soon ^_^
Bye Shizu[AFK
. NNOOOO /)oOÂ´(\
8,1this is like a cross between Rise of the Triads and System Shock
/me is intently watching Doom
SaLKiD99: you werent spamming it silly~ I was just telling you for future ref ^_^. I dont want someone to potentially get a warning from a mod ^_^
yeah, #bronystate has about 7 flags on it right now actually
Indeed
It does?~
[+JKLPjnt]
back~
/me hopes that none of them involve the '~' key
the ponychat client truncates, evidently
+KJLPjnt
damnit I was ninjad
sorry Fleur , but because when i was reading it , i thought it says "...Don't Spam /me(Just a Friendly Warning)
none of them do Nyria ^_^
Airhorn alarm?
Good Fleur ~
That's great to hear~
So when I see (+JKLPntj 5:1), what does that mean?
Also, if that's lava, then that is convection?
+K means that you cant send the exact same msg that someone sent b4 you
give me a sec; i'm looking that upmyseelf
Oh, I mean the 5:1.
+J means that you cant auto rejoin
ok , now i know what is that bing sound
+j means that only a certian amount of people can connect in the same second
I just wonder what 5:1 means.
5 people can connect in one second
Oh.
Well, I didn't notice those (+'s) Until now so that means I don't have to worry about them~
any more and it will stop them
Kammerjunki believe the combination there is "j 5:1"
+n and +t are default ones
which is a throttle on the number of people who can join
in that case, 5 users in 1 second at a time
I just said that silly
and obviously i wasn't looking <_<
<3
oh look, a shiny!
/me chases the shiny
Where?~
I like shiny.
I like Shiny as well~
Shiny is my favourite.
I need the Shiny thing
~
I am not sure what +P is but when Shizu comes back you can ask her. She knows what she is talking about like a damn boss.
umm , how do you do bold the name of a chatter?
SaLKiD99 - it does it automatically when you type their name
and it is case sensative
SaLKiD99: You don't it happens when somebody mentions your name~
and only on that user's screen
Oh ninja'd~
Fleur: Once set, the channel will not be deleted when it becomes empty. Additionally, the +b, +e, +I and +q lists have higher capacity to make channel forwarding easier.
I think
list of IRC flags: http://docs.dal.net/docs/modes.html
So, who's playing?
Marathon 2~
so when i write , like Nyria or Fleur , do your names bolden? because when i write a name of a chatter , it isn't bolded to me
"who" not "what"
and that would be Wrek, i believe
Awesome.
Thank you MirrorImage :3
SaLKiD99: Indeed~ It's bold for me~
it shouldn't bold for you SaLKiD99
But not for you~
oh , ok
it only bolds and pings when your own name is said
MirrorImage: +P isn't there, only +p
and my bowels are telling me to get moving...
I get a sound when you type my name SaLKiD99
ok
bing~
well , im going to the bathroom
also, I shall train you in the way of Tab
brb
when you get back that is
I wish I got that sound, but I'm using XChat.
Fleur is master sensei~
Not a master ^_^
/me glomps kirzstryfe
11,14good afternoon everypony :)
/me hugs Fleur
Hey kirzstryfe ~
hi kirzstryfe
00,10oh hi kirzstryfe
ohai Sumica :)
Oh hey Sumica ~
Afternoon ponies ^^
hello
Hey pinkydash ~
Hello arrowtobroknee ~
hi pinkydash
00,10hey wait, if every one thinks it's my birthday, should i go around asking for stuffs?
hello ponyfolk
Sure, why not.
Hi arrowtobroknee
AvÃª, arrowtobroknee.
Inb4 Sumica becomes Spikcal Jackson in the end~
so what is this?
No clue.
00,10it's marathon
Marathon 2~
Don't be like Spike now Sumica
Is that the game's title, or is it just a marathon?
SaLKiD99: Try typing the first 3-5 letters of someone's username and then press Tab. If you dont get their name press it again before hitting any other key. Do that untill you get the right user ^_^
00,10But I want a pimp hat
inb4 Sumica is a dragon now
im back
Fine...
3-5? Usually, the first two letters work for me.
/me gives Sumica a grade A pimp hat
/me gives Sumica his best pimp hat~
Oh you have 2 hats~ Just like TF2
2 hats? TF2?
put one on top of the other~
/me gives another pimp hat for the hat stack
That makes you a poor Scotsman.
Kammerjunk: I say 3-5 for when the chat is huuuuuge
Irishman*
is it dead yet?
Oh. Well, I'm not here when the chat is huuuuuge, so I wouldn't know.
/me grabs Fleur and hauls her off to his horde
anybody on here play terraria
what's the Friday Stream?
damn that overcharge
SaLKiD99: check the "Home" page
I do, from time to other.
Friday stream is movie night,
that starts at 7pm EST
and Saturday Morning is PREMIERE!
I'd ask what we were going to watch on Friday, but it wouldn't matter.
ok
brb
again
We watch a movie then an ep
I just remembered... It's Thursday~
crap, got disconnected, sorry if i missed it, but anybody here play terraria?
then we take a 10 min break
I'd watch literally anything on BronyState.
Ingwaz: I do, from time to other.
^
then we watch another movie and then another ep
I play terarria
Indeed I would watch most things here~
I can't bother getting it to work on Linux, though.
what the
its a Trap!
Suddenly, wallpaper.
And quit?~
anyone know how to deal with the corruption and hallowed areas after beating the wall of flesh? i didnt think theyd be this much of a pain
death
corruption spawned literally right next to my base
well, it IS hard mode. I'd recommend looking for a tutorial on Youtube or the Terarria Wiki
Omnom skyrim
"Screw this I'm playing Skyrim"
Couldn't you use that purification powder from the Dryad?
do you have the fluttershy mod?
I know what I wouldnt watch here
Water Babes
oh wait
im in the same room , right? if it is , im back
now I remember
I'm playing Magicka right now
Kammerjunk: the corruption spreads much faster in hard mode and purification powder only does so much
Ah.
00,10ohhh, I wonder if wrek got pony mods =p
dig a hole 3 blocks wide
The single worst movie ever. Worse than Babes in Toyland
the whole height of the world
i hope theres the pony mods
Which apparently is a while back.
*sings along*
Amras0000: that sounds like a huge hassle, not to mention the corruption doesnt go straight down, its diagonal
Hey Everypony!!! :D
AvÃª, ColgateSparkle.
make sure there are no blocks in a 3 wide column from the bottom of hell to the top of the map
Hey ColgateSparkle ~
annnnnd Done..
Hi ColgateSparkle
I switched on at the right time! Sykrim woooo
hi , ColgateSparkle!
that took forever .___.
And hello loading screen~
hey there everypony ^_^
that's the only way to stop it, I think
otherwise, you can regularly clear it with purification powder
anything streaming?
hi , ScootaChicken!
Mmmmmdragons.
Looking cool Dashie_Dashie
Hey ScootaChicken ~
Hey ScootaChicken
ugggh...i dont want to have to resort to a map editor or anything but this is leaving me few options
It looks great Dashie_Dashie ~
Fluttershy mods?
Hi ScootaChicken, SB is streaming skyrim
Dashie_Dashie: It's way better than anything pony-related I can draw.
00,10nope wrek is
:p
no word on fluttershy yet
I heard Dovahkin and now im wonering whos streaming
who's the Streamer? (if you know what i mean)
Funny..I was just about to start playing skyrim :/
00,10so you know at least there wont be steaking any thing that is't bolted down
00,10er stealing
Stop right there, criminal scum.
SaLKiD99: From the wallpaper, I'd say Wrek.
hmm...okay
that was my first OC drawing done in MS paint, with breaks that took me about 12 hours LOL.
lol Sumica
I bought Dragon Age Origins today been on my list of things to get for a while :)
He has that Twilight-heart-mane wallpaper, I recall.
Uh oh
Dead goat?!
Poor mooses... meese. moase..
dun dun dun~
I don't know.
why does everybody thinks Scootaloo is a Chicken?
because she is?
SaLKiD99: Because of the other CMC.
because applebloom said so
Yeah?
SaLKiD99: It's a meme~
okay
/me rages when people call scoot a chicken
In the Stare Master.
And what arrowtobroknee said
and fluttershy is a tree
and spike is rainbow dash
Scootaloo...scoot scoot scootaloooo :D
And Sweetie Belle is a dictionary.
and applebloom and sweetie belle are dictionaries
yeah
Oh yeah, Applebloom is a dictionary too.,
and Pinkie Pie is the "big gun"
In their tongue he is Bronvahkyn Dragon-Brony
2 dictionaries and a chicken walk into a tree house
Fleur: Scootaloo is a chicken. <3
/me sits on chat to think
/me will throw her shoe at Cy` when she gets home
otakon: Well, why'd they walk into a treehouse? That's just silly.
08,14i jsut dtno kno wta wnet worng. . .
/me is being squashed by DerpyHooves`
wat
What's wrong?~
/me pulls DerpyHooves` off of the chat with a big hug
00,10intersting choice of weapons
Derpy Hooves is adawwwwable
What happened DerpyHooves` ?
DerpyHooves`: You have no idea how hard I'm trying not to correct you.
Can he got 3rd person I want to see his character :)
/me hugs DerpyHooves` "Hello Dear!"
Because seriously.
It's a problem to me.
00,10Oh hi DerpyHooves`
Cy` dont you remember what Derpy said in the ep?
Sumica: he like dual axes is all
/me still wonders why is Scootaloo a chicken and AB and SB are Dictionaries
2 ponys walk into a bar , the third ducks under it
/me facehoofs "Oh yeah..."
00,10SaLKiD99 magic duh
SaLKiD99: It's said so in one or two episodes
SaLKiD99: Conversations they had in some episodes
Jesus saves.... the rest of you take damage as normal
It's always magic~

damnnit... my computer can't even handle skyrim with every program closed T_T
SaLKiD99: Watch "The State Master", "The Return of Harmony: Part 1" and one of the later episodes in S2 ("Family Appreciation Day", I think) for more information.
im so jelly
I doubt it
if Hasbro overuses derpy
The Stare Master*
Butterfly_Pony - Derpy will keep appearing, i'm sure, but i doubt she'll have voice roles again
she won't be as special
I tried to make a chemist joke, but all the good ones argon.
ah bummer
Wait...
I know that voice.
I need some foooood~
That's Meridith from Dragon Age II!
Derpy will be made into a toy
Meredith*?
/me starts rotting on the ground...
dat Daedric Lord
Meridia
I like that Derpy got an appearance, but I also hope that they won't continue to cater to the fans.
Well, in Dragon Age II, it was -ith something.
narrows it down
arrowtobroknee: The Templar lady who you ended up killing.
"Discerning the Traunsmadene" is a Daedric Quest , if u didn't know
Gah im getting rusty , i had to read that one 3 times to get it Sumica , H2O2
boo
Hi Shy
TrixieMuffin: It's alright. I forgive you for anything with such a name.
Oh hi, Shy.
Hello Shy :3
hello shy
I love how Ninjapony is the first person to say hi to me. xD
...this Live Stream is better than watching TV , and this Chat Room is something fun to do! :D
:3c You got me good.
Hey, everyone!
and hi , Shy!
AvÃª, Randomnerd.
Hi, Shy
It's because I'm sneaky that way ^^
hi , Randomnerd!
Teehee~
hello random
Hello Randomnerd
Quid agis?
Hey, SalKiD99
Uh oh I missed Fleur didn't I? D:
hiya Shy , Randomnerd
Hai Randomnerd
um yes
Shy: Just barely
she left a bit ago
Lol.
Had class soon.
Cy`, Kammerjunk, Ninjapony, otakon, arrowtobroknee
/me realized the Stream is Bufffering
Did I mis anyone?
00,10wrek might have locked up
Maybe
yes Randomnerd
?
Refresh the stream~
So I found out there's a gymnasium close by which could teach me Latin properly.
That unprovoked assault
F5~
Shame it doesn't have anything else I want or need.
I finally supported the show -I bought a Calender
Can you kill this lass afterwards?
SaLKiD99, I said hi to you fist :)
Maybe knock her unconscious and throw her in the sea?
Well, I will be back later, then. Need to go do some stuff real quick IRL. Laterz.
oh , ok Randomnerd :)
Bye Shy :3
bye , Shy!
Bye, Shy
First, rather.
Kammerjunk: And then make a candy bar out of the natural eviorment and give it to the person before he or she's deep sea adventure~
just a minute
Nyria: Quite.
Yeah, the calender uses some of Faust's concept art.
ta ta Shy ~
i just missed the Action this whole time...;(
Oh really?
:(
The early pic of Fluttershy with Angel before they finalized the art. They added her wings
i was waiting for Randomner's Response
and than Replied...
and said bye too Shy...
and then Refreshed
SaLKiD99: You need two monitors.
And then Dari bot...
It makes everything easier.
umm , why?
Oh, wait.
Never mind. I'm still assuming having an IRC client is mandatory.
HI GUYS!
what does IRC stands for?
First thing going in the Calender!? Marking down BroNYCon!
Egh... Does anyone else get headphone hair?~
What the hell am I watching?
Internet Relay Chat.
Skyrim~!
Skyrim of course
I WANT SKYRIM.
Skyrimming
-rageface-
You're using one right now.
It\s a trap!
That's a map~!
hi ScootaChicken
Hey ScootaChicken ~

GalladeXD: So did I.
It your computer still crashing on you today?~
okay, brb need a drink
I cant wait to get a 360...
But I "own" Skyrim now too.
guys I've been here for a while ;O_o
I've just been lurking
Pfft, PC is where it's at~
Aye, I much prefer my PC over any console.
well, lurking and being an ACTAvist
This feels like the Lost temple~
Upgrading hardware is so exciting.
I hope some ponies will come on later...
I'm just waiting for one big rock to come down~
is there a way to stop adds from popping up on the stream? ugh
.___.
ScootaChicken: I'm planning to do that to, but I can't before tomorrow.
adblock
why not Kammerjunk?
i wish i could play Portal 2 , but i finished the Game...
Because I'm not at home.
(on PS3
/me 's desk just exploded into a thousand pieces
)
orait
But TOMMOROW.
This is a quiet video.
Hi

Kammerjuck: Wha?

Ave is greetings in Latin
I think...
Hi ScootaChicken
22 of eu states already signed acta -.-
ScootaChicken: Certe.

GalladeXD: Weaponized Rebecca Black

XDDDD
Oh hey, only 50000 'till they've reached their goal.
what is ACTA?
STUPID AD.
SaLKiD99: I'd link the video in this room, but no video links while a stream is going on.
Your new to the internet right SaLKiD99 ?~
Can I PM it to you?
/me is kidding~
well , no
Kammerjunk: you can link
My OC took me a little over 12 hours
SaLKiD99, https://s3.amazonaws.com/access.3cdn.net/75979d5cc0096c5bc8_dkm6iydok.pdf this will tell you pretty much all you need to know
I'm happy. No school tomorrow.
sorrty
dayum .___.
sorry

it's okay, just no videos on BMN or Premieres
It's fine*
MadxHatter123: I'm happy, no school forever. XD
Anyone here?
I hate school. :|
10,02My name was called before O___o
Sorry about that spam *stares at enter key*
I'm happy.
I also dont have school tomorrow :)
I haven't had school most of the week.
Hello?
SuperBrony64: <3<3<3<3<3<3<3 wubwubwubwub
Bonjour
nah otakon, I think you're only allowed to post videos when there's no stream
Who on earth would watch another video during a premiere :O
Thank god I have no school tommorow.
I had school today
SuperBrony64: It was nothing invloving you, somebody used SB as Sweetie Belles name~
ohai SuperSaxyMaid63 ^_^
10,02Ohai :3 wub wub wub
Echo Echo Echo
Though it's nice to see you SuperBrony64 ~!
SuperBrony64: is it okay to post videos during the week?
SB!!!@!~~
I don't have school ever again. xD
/me glomps
Yeah, and I got the Newest Friday the 13th movie to watch too. :)
DJ PON3 says: wub wub wub wub
/me hugs SuperBrony64 ~
/me says wun wun wun wun wun
because wub is oldschool
10,02It's technically alright, but you should get permission from the current streamer before posting it
How long is this video?
and because my fingers are cold
Guess not. See ya!
GalladeXD: It's live~
/me hugs Nyria
Are there any Linux wizards in here who have used Wine?
Not I..
What a shame-.
I hope it's not an ENTIRE playthrough of Skyrim, then it would spoil the whole game for me.
10,02I'm in class right now learning the deeper meaning behind the name of a private community "Plantation Oaks" O___o
eeyup
Sounds like fun SB~
SuperBrony64: wat
SuperBrony64: Sounds....useless.?
entire playthrough of skyrim?
impossibru
Think he's finished the main story anyways
unless we deprive him of sleep
Good.
SuperBrony64: your classes are so strange
for a few years
DAT DRAGON.
10,02It's the Psychology of Prejudice and Stereotyping
interesting
But I like stereotypes!
I gots a question. Is there a movie night tomorrow?
Where would most comedy shows be without them?
10,02it's a general ed requirement :/
MadxHatter123: Yup.
00,10random horse
hey everypony !!!
SuperBrony64: What in the world is your Major? Because you have some of the wierdest topics in your classes...
Ah, what's playing?
Horses in skyrim are fearless
Hi StickySyrup
10,02BMN is tomorrow at 7 PM EST and restreamed at 2 PM EST on Saturday
Besides, the Danish stereotype is just weird.
MadxHatter123, Alice in Wonderland and Epic Movie
Poor dragon
And awesome.
its going to be horrible.
00,10silly wrek no quick swap set for weapons
OP much?
I feel bad for the dragon.
There goes that dragon~
pfft
10,02My major is Biomedical Engineering
the dragon didn't really die
Nice SB~
According to this Internet comic I used to read, Danes are VIKINGS.
So I won't complain.
Cool. Can't wait.
It has some wierd class topics..
Its souls just got absorbed
I want its skeleton!
Silly imperials
oh crap... i gtg sorry guys.. I forgot to do my coursework..
>A person has just slain a dragon, AI attacks said person
10,02Well, it's a random college requirement and this class seemed easy enough :P
/me can't wait to go back to college. He finally figured out what his Major and Minor are going to be<3
FUS RO DAH!!!
I had to say that/
A problem I have in Skyrim is that I want to pick up EVERYTHING.
byebye
XD
lol
So I pick up a bunch of dragon bones.
He is invincible!
And then I never sell them.
Did he just make it storm with his voice? Awesome :O
10,02But after this class, im sure I won't ever discriminate between yellow and blue ponies ever again.
Kammerjunk - that's where you #1 stock up on Potions of Strength (increase carrying capacity)
Nooooo
and 2 - establish a "loot chest" somewhere
HE KILLED THE HORSE. :O
The horse D:
Oh well.
10,02:P
But I mean to sell the stuff I pick up.
at least itnwasnt a pony
D:
Poor thing
Why would you do that? :O
aw, poor horse
I just never remember to when I'm in town.
Kammerjunk - yes, but the stores are going to run out of gold eventually
At least it wasnt Fluttershy.
Yeah.
so whatever you want to sell but don't have the market capital for, you throw in the chest
I do EVERYTHING in the towns I visit, but I never actually sell it.
and when you finally do remember, you go pull stuff from there
Aha.
I think my foods ready~
I just ate.
at the minimum, it keeps you from carting around unnecessary stuff
omg...
Nyria: What happened to my food yesterday?
What lousy boatmanship
How the hell did the boat get over there?!
lobster?
SOPA are Threatning the Internet , and so are ACTA?
AHHHHHHHHHHHHH CRAB!!!!
Crab people
Attack its weakpoint for massive damage!
At least it wasnt a spider.
Argh, stupid ads.
SOPA and PIPA were ultimately shelved.
SOPA bombed, We need to worry about ACTA now.
But ACTA was not.
ACTA died.
GalladeXD: Source?
.____.
acta got signed by 22 eu states
Oh, jumpo crab legs.
Yup.
It did~?
Well, its GONNA be dead.
Ha ha.
dat noob picklocking
This place has a lot of giant enemy crabs
and others want to follow
including germany
It's been negotiated for some years now.
now that we've got a hold of ACTA
I hope there are no giant spiders in Skyrim.
things are going to go a lot differently
I found her Beacon on in a random chest in a giants encampment o.o
GalladeXD: Brace yourself
That's on tricky lock.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
one*
NOT SPIDERS!!!
I swear, if Google starts protesting ACTA, it's going down.
I haz 70 lockpicking :3
Google is as powerful as most nations.
GalladeXD: you about to be disappointed
hmm...... that food looks edible
<3 google~
wait , how old are u supposed to be to sign in? (just asking)
Theres spiders...insnt there?
*There's
AND Google controls many states' access to their own information.
Delta squad is in yo' house, bitch!
Is it just me, or is the stream kinda quiet?
THATS AN UGLY ORC.
it is
its a little quiet
the stream is very quiet...
Wait, wrong lecture interruption?
Too quiet.
yes it is a ugly orc
Lol.
no its too loud
that volume
Ah, there we go.
The stream must be hunting wabbits
i just got here. is this skyrim?
That's better.
but orc's arent' SUPPOSED to be pretty
it's normal cuz we're not saturday : P
inb4 he gets the dawnstar blade.
thank you , Wrek
inb4 it's a trap~!
But that orc is uglier than other orcs.
Flyyy!
(if you are the Streamer)
:U
Woosh.
whitescreen
#
Beam me up!
I didn't think the stream was quiet. But then again, my volume is at maximum.
Ohhhh i hate this quest....
Don\t look down
In before the Cole Train gives a speech.
aww, you looked down
He sounds weird.
Woah, you're high up. Don't slip.
He? She?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vovJ-JsK9h4 <-- Great Family Fued Moment
This voice is horrendous. :P
Hop, Skip, and a Jump!
ADDS ugh
The voice sounds like a nerd.
Daedric Prince or Daedric Princess?
Hey. Guess which very important US state is among the 60% of all US states to store their data with Google.
Texas.
CANADA!!
he said important Randomnerd
Uh... Mexico?~
Nope. Washington DC.
Close enough.
He survived a long fall, hes good
DC isn't a state.
lol String_Shredder, Texas is unfortunately VERY important.
Details, details.
hehe , Washington DC Universe...(not Trolling , just a Pun)
I thought Texas was a poor excuse to kill people for no good reason?
Oh man, this is just like fallout.
uh oh, only 4 lockpicks left
NOOB PICKLOCKING.
My point is that many of the US governments are storing their data with Google, via Google Apps.
no it's a good excuse to kill people for no reason
RawketLawnchair: Gee. I wonder why.
Proof?
get the pony mod!!!!
It's the second most populous state in the Union... and until Rick Perry secedes, we're stuck with 'em.
^
GalladeXD: I'm not saying that they are, I'm saying that Google are saying that they are.
But one moment anyway.
I bet half of the downloas for the ridable pony mod was just so people could kill them constantly and forever.
hmm...Pony Mod? sounds like a good idea for the site
Can you play as a dragon in Skyrim?
I'm from NY, you have no idea how nice it would be if Texas left and California fell into the sea.
Any one who has a 360 with MW3 want to play with me?
I'm gonna go for now, I'll talk to everyone when I get home from work. Bye Everypony!
GalladeXD: nope
bye!
Bye, Cy`
Must be a mod.
Expecto Patronum!
Well, you do have the soul of a dragon. So I guess that counts?
by Cy`
bye cy
There's this mod where all the dragons are replaced by fluttershy
Kill dragons just by shouting! You can even have a beard!
yes there is
I saw that one.
How horrifying.
Fus Ro D'aaaawww
^
*gets knocked back*
When I get Skyrim, I'm gonna download the Fluttershy mod.
I want a beard~!
its on your left wrek
Beards are awesome, Nyria.
But but but...That means killing Fluttershy :(
They are~
D8>
i got stuck in the same room :D
D8
pssht
IT'S A TRAP!!
oh Wrek... passage on the left
Goddesses, I'm going to need some headache pills. Be back in a jiffy.
Be back later everypony.
yay
Needs a mod that turns all dragons to spike
how long did this Stream go on?!
then I could kill them
ta ta Dashie~
Bye, Dashie_Dashie
bye , Dashie_Dashie!
bye Dashie_Dashie
It's still ongoing, SaLKiD99
Why would you want to kill Spike? :(
Apperently everyone at my school hates spike~
because I wouldn't hurt an adult dragon
Randomnerd: it's not spike. It's spike douche brother Skipe
I don't know why~
lol RAWRity.
You should just remind him to be generous!
he didnt touch the pedestal...
i think he did
these ninja loads ect make me so jelly
it takes me about an hour to load a new area
"I suppose you'll be eating me now, or something" and then NOTHING sexual happened.
use the force!
and the game crashes if I runh even a single thing at the same time
Dat lock
last lockpick
lol
I think lock picking looks harder here than in fallout
there it goes
When having a very low ammount of lockpicks always save~
you pansy!
Down to my last lockpick... better drink my own urine.
lol
lockpicking in skyrim and fallout is about the same difficulty for me
me too
I usually get it in 2-3 tries top
but since hes loosing a lot of lockpicks I assume it looked hard
he needs to buy more is all
well... im gonna go play some skyrim now... with dragonponies
oooh
ta ta Midnight_Tempest ~
bye!
00,10god the names people pick BeeberFett >_<
cya Midnight_Tempest
Have fun Midnight_Tempest
night Midnight
It only takes me one try on fallout, I don't know How I'd do on here.
Hey everypony :D
