Dem freshly washed sheets.
I can't remember when I saw Code Lyoko, only that by that point I'd already tasted other animes and was starting to give up on American cartoons. :p
13they did on rare occasion
this is looooooooooooong
Not a Paladin.
13pretty much only when something world-threatening happened, otherwise once aelita was out the war was mostly confined to lyoko itself
also, Code Lyoko is not an anime.
XD
Tis a french cartoon.
this XD
Neither is Avatar.
13william

yeah that's it.
William was a BAMF
the show took too long to get anywhere in every episode, but that sorta changed in later seasons

His reviews aren't based on being accurate representations of the games. They're based on being satirical reviews of games. I don't think he expects people to take him 100% seriously.
He just spouts his opinion and a bunch of random comedic bollocks around it.
That's perfectly fair Saxy. :)

It's an educated opinion supported by rational explanation.

hoof'
I'm back!
and the stream is STILL down....
That's kinda neat.
0,14indeed
software is a little fickle but the device is awesome, and only $40 compared to the $2000 a local company quoted
Neat.
oh stream still down?
Yip.
http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/119609 << look at the bottom right of the page
is there a stream?
not right now, sb's working on it
oh
shed manly tears*
damn is that THAT good?
yeah, easy typo to make that
lol
/me must get back to his "work"
I'm still trying to decide whether to read it
you should it is amazing
but sad
/me feels like singing.
and can potentially cause me to lose control over my emotions
0,14...mfw I just found my hand twin
guess ill give it a try..... even if i hate fanfics
Oh? Whom Saxy
0,14http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwTFGNg0vkU
0,14and realized
....
0,14this person's hands
Dat OOO BELT.
0,14are just like mine
OH MY GOOOOOOD. Want
I already am :p
yeah i dont like to read
/me has seen the hand twins episode of friends, not by his choice though
0,14XD
I think Ive heard of them
thats a song of theirs
AAA
noes!
well tbh
...
MLD did not make me tear up
don't tell me if he breaks down in the end, I want to find out my own
na na i think ill read it
I was like "meh"
I can prove it
doesn*t
lol ^
I cannot watch that four minute scene from Up without tearing up
yeah
/me didnt tear up...
/me flooded the theater with his man tears
/me is ok with that
/me remembers crying in the theater with Toy Story 3.
oh man... T_T
oh man toy story 3
/me didnt cry for any of the TS's
0,14I teared up and shed a single tear at the end of TS3
not even the near end of 3?
no
brb
aw
great song <3
It is pretty sad, yeah.
SBBBBBBBBBB
are you still there?
It is <3
all the toy stories are good'
I think that Toy Story works in 3D. In Live Action, it feels like a gimmick.
I saw it in 3D. It was pretty nice.
I mean, ugh... syntax.
Live action?
/me explodes
oh ok
Cartoons like Toy Story are good in 3D, you can suspend disbelief if it looks unrealistic.
sory Fleur :(
YEah, I'm still working on it :/
aparently i saw toy story on ice, but i was 4 or 5
But live-action films with 3D effects look gimmicky.
/me glances at clock...
and here I thought I might get to sleep on time for once...
11,01My turn to turn in for the night.
/me has just realized he hasn't seriously worked out in 2 months.

0,14I'm a Bang player myself, abeit a TERRIBAD one
I don't have the reflex's for it
0,14that's why you practice
bangs getting a bit of a buff in extend i think
making it easier to get his furikazan
maybe get some time in as com
yes
^
but we don't have anny
damn, now I'm hungry
and I'm too ill to buy any
tager is getting a ridiculous buff for extend as well
is the stream paused or something?
0,14oh yeah, I saw the day 1 tier list for Tager
13und in third ramen, just for the broth
yeah Fleur
0,14No wai
I have about 1000 diffrent soups
its ridiculous, you take the charcter whos a throw character, and buff his combos and damage like crazy
they are my main food
oh ok. I was thinking my end was fucked up
nothing thick
I knok
know
you knok?
0,14it is possible to make a grapple charcter goos
0,14*good
13knokc knock
potemkin
0,14like Potemkin
that's all you can do
i have no problem with tager being balanced, but as he is inextend....thats not ballanced
stream please..............................................
13to celebrate.... um.... thursday?
the only winning option against tager now is to run like crazy
0,14Bang has it kinda easy in that regard
I ate a samwitch
and every thing
13huzzah
0,14Poison nail, bumpers/FRKZ and run away all day
Fleur: you do that
0,14same
I could make bread today
0,14especially because the Hazama/Tager is soooooooooooooo dumb
0,14Mike Z hates it
we have a fuckton of yeast and flour
0,14with a burning passion
0,14Tager is a grapple character like Zangief
^
0,14he needs to get in very close to do damage
0,14Hazama is VERY good at fighting from a distance
/me fights best with Jen and the police woman
hes got good zoning at a long range, but not damage
0,14true
0,14in any case, the Hazama/Tager matchup is in hazama's favor
0,14also, the police woman is Noel Vermillion
her!
thank you saxy
0,14np
0,14XD
/me keeps the combo going as Noel
damn i hate that bvitch
good night everyone
no breathing room whatsoever is how I play her
0,14it's been a while since I kept up with BB knowledge
0,14...
0,14...
0,14SCRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUB
killed him in 22 seconds and he didnt even touch me
0,14Ingwaz /)
it was glorious
(\
Alright, going back to stream
0,14I may not be good myself, but if I lose, I take it and try not to get salty
finally
i have no problem losing provided the player is legitimately skilled
0,14same
0,14I was on a 27 win streak in MvC3 the other day
argh
0,14and while they were using top tier guys
wow....sounds like potential for scrubbiness
0,14they played them very well
actually
I have a event that happened that perplexed my
0,14^
0,14people still do that
like Cable!
my brother got a bit more skill, mostly relying heavily on wesker and his ridiculous pressure
0,14his entire Sent stategy was NEUTRAKLIZE, NEUTRALIZE
yep...
13daleks?
0,14my Tasky can :3
0,14I just jumped and shot arrows
*and
0,14if he wants to play keepaway, I can too
i hate playing keep away
0,14same
0,14ahh, SSF4
0,14I don't play that online
<3 Ulala :)
0,14heck, I don't even play it
Ulaaaalaaaa!
over and over and over, the speed at which e-honda moves is hard to counter
never
nooo wait sory.....
13was ist going on in this thread
My cousin just kept choosing
The Apprentice
0,14UGH
or Kilik!
0,14grah
inb4 his thumbs bleed
0,14the Apprentice was scary in Arcade mode
I don't
it hurts me
?
ooooohhhhh
0,14in any case, it's time for me to hit the hay
I HATE time precision platform games
0,14I'll see you all tomorrow
13night saxy~
night
goodnight Saxy ^_^
13sleep well
Goodnight Saxy. :)

This is my drawing music lol
heres mine pony http://i301.photobucket.com/albums/nn73/stanzadifabio/myPony.png
I haven't made an OC pony.
unicorn
I'm using MS Paint for mine.
just use the pony creator! its THAT easy :D!
using that as a basis for a hand drawn OC
Pegasi ftw <3
alicorns are overrated xD
And I came to the conclusion that while it would be great being able to perform magic, it doesn
Like an eagle.
Piloting a blimp.
No, and in the end, I figured that while it would be fun, certainly, it doesn't quite fit me.
hello again
Also I'm having a hard time drawing ...well...cute
?????
:O!
yes
you do
may i join in?
Most certainly
Could be longer.
......
you remind me of my best friend..........
Great song to draw too.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6s4n76ti3Xs
I was still not quite satisfied with the nose, but it would have to do.
just try to think how would be to play videogames as a pony
I know a few sports fans, for example.
welll
lol
and computers
Exactly.
I wish I could stream for you guys to keep you entertained @_@
and making electronic music.....
I'd draw, you'd listen to music and watch me draw lol.
I think I'll make more than on OC and then write a fic
problem solved
:D!
cant unicorns fly with magic?
16*
bah......
u saw last episodes with the pie family?
Last Roundup?
uh well I think that can actually be explained
Family Appreciation Day?
hmmmmmmmmmmm
With the zapapples?
Baby Cakes!
With Pinkie and the Cakes.
But that was explained, though.
Yes, exactly.
I like the idea of ley lines running under Equestria.
no offense of course :)
:(
SCOOOTALOOOOO!!!!!
wat
none taken I enjoy my nerdness
(im quoting myself)
I feel all twilight sparkley
Twilight is my favourite pony.
yeah, its full of bugs
wut?

See where that led it.
I'm...lost

You know, that old MMORPG made titled "Real Life".

Oh, Goddesses.

i would do shy but we only have sadshy and rageshy

we should watch it here sometime

eh, probably just a prank or something
probably
brb, there's a girl coming towards me out of my computer screen
have fun
:O?
eh, I gave it to someone I don't like
also, of all the things deviantart could be banned for, the reason our provider chooses to censor it is 'web chat'
hahahahaahahaha
also, DA has "web chat"?
toilet'
its a shitty filter if its letting this through
it really is
plus until about a couple weeks ago there was a really easy workaround
thats why its shitty
not necesarily
I've seen a lot of those filtering 'proxies' just hijaching any traffic on port 80, and filtering the GET comments
off to lunch guys
bye
caching'
commands
i was just wondering about eqd
/me yawns his way back into existance
Hi everyone
I hope this tea revives me
brb
/me is half busy playing some games.
/me glances up and then looks away again.
i made an oc http://dl.dropbox.com/u/51948537/Screenshot%20-%20260112%20-%2023%3A32%3A36.png :3
well done
/me must learn to draw at some point in the future
pony creator is good for now though
still needs a cutiemark though
:OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
!cd
yes
(and hence also filtered)
yes but it filters based on the host parameter
'later
there's some truth in that
but the easiest to circumvent is to just VPN out to somewhere else; assuming traffic on other ports then port 80 is possible
what's a tafe, if i may ask?
It's all trimmed up and ready for coloring :3

Not bad for using ms paint though. =p

No way :O
That's not good at all.

DDDDDDDD:
07,01EqD
07,01Facebook
07,01Twitter
07,01Youtube
I've already already signed a Petition, even though I'm from the US.
It'll be good for me.
07,01ACTA is global
07,01it does not matter where you come from
ACTA is a treaty - it only has powers in nations that sign it
which, unfortunately, is a lot of nations
Liivate: got a link on that?
and signed
also, Berne's convention, DMCA, patriot act, and assorted "if we want to we can invade" laws in america already make that we don't legally exist
<--
I just signed the petition
oh I totally mis read that hahaha
this is why we can't have good things! :'(
I though you said "who thinks this is total bullshit" @_@
well meant to say come up

ACTA got signed?
I see a silhouette of a Fluttershy.
Yeah, US had already signed it, but I was told the the EU just did too.
Damn.
bbl
See you, Fl-
Aww.
TBH I think it's going to fail miserably. Where are all the millions needed to fund ACTA going to come from?
Too slow.....
The government, putting itself on more debt.
>Voice recognition
Lolno.

I see Kinect hitting its peak in 2013
I would not play an FPS with voice recognition.

you couldn't just use A HEADSET!?
not nearly as good as him though
"ACTA is a confusing mess. Even its signatories don't agree on how it's supposed to work."
a HEADSET would WORK!
but their only 20 bucks
Upwards of 70,000 people were protesting in Poland
I personally like Kinect more for its professional applications compared to games
i would play doom on kinect if it registered me saying "big fucking gun"
Yeah, I read that. Dang, even in Poland? That's crazy.
LOL
I can see it now....*someone trying to play* Submachine gun!!*Parents behind him talking to each other* Yeah and the blanket covers me perfectly....*Guy playing* NO DON'T COVER ME!!!
Buy a gun before bullets are banned all over the world. Buy gas before gas is banned. XD

8,1Radu: also, there's GIMP if you want to go the free software root
8,1but that's not for vectors either
I see
8,1vectors: inkscape, non-vectors: gimp
Oh, very cool. Ty :o
there's also Paint.NET that i use rather than GIMP
00,10are they argueing the merrents of demos?
What's up with that user named _____________ ?
Radu - don't know, but it's separating the Ops/HOps/Voiced users from the normal users
8,1and, of course, gimp and inkscape have the advantage of being cross-platform
Not bad.
Do they have paint. net for Win 7?
8,1thoguh i think you can run Paint Tool SAI under WINE
Ill look up inkScape too :o
Paint.NET uses the .NET Framework
8,1anyhoos, that's probably not even relevant to you

Campaign
Was that the power glove?~
Versus is no fun because people exploit too many glitches
it has 2 Resolutions , which are very bad
Oh I don't bother with VS~ To many people raging~
I liked the Specops missions in Modernwarfare 2
it's just a bit slower

Kammerjunki believe the combination there is "j 5:1"

hello ponyfolk
Sure, why not.
No clue.
00,10it's marathon
Marathon 2~
Is that the game's title, or is it just a marathon?
00,10But I want a pimp hat
Fine...
3-5? Usually, the first two letters work for me.
Oh you have 2 hats~ Just like TF2
2 hats? TF2?

/me gives another pimp hat for the hat stack
That makes you a poor Scotsman.

Suddenly, wallpaper.
And quit?~
anyone know how to deal with the corruption and hallowed areas after beating the wall of flesh? i didnt think theyd be this much of a pain
corruption spawned literally right next to my base
"Screw this I'm playing Skyrim"
Couldn't you use that purification powder from the Dryad?
do you have the fluttershy mod?
oh wait
now I remember
I'm playing Magicka right now
dig a hole 3 blocks wide
The single worst movie ever. Worse than Babes in Toyland
the whole height of the world
i hope theres the pony mods
I haven't really played Terraria much since when that hellish-looking armour was awesome.
Which apparently is a while back.
*sings along*

Fluttershy mods?

Good.

A problem I have in Skyrim is that I want to pick up EVERYTHING.

And then I never sell them.
Nooooo

HE KILLED THE HORSE. :O
The horse D:

Poor thing
Why would you do that? :O

At least it wasnt Fluttershy.
Yeah.
I do EVERYTHING in the towns I visit, but I never actually sell it.
Aha.
I think my foods ready~
I just ate.
omg...
like for me, for some reason my Food tab is always unnecessarily stocked
lobster?
AHHHHHHHHHHHHH CRAB!!!!
Crab people
At least it wasnt a spider.
But ACTA was not.
ACTA died.
.____.
acta got signed by 22 eu states
Oh, jumpo crab legs.
Yup.
It did~?
Ha ha.
dat noob picklocking
and others want to follow
including germany
It's been negotiated for some years now.
now that we've got a hold of ACTA
things are going to go a lot differently
I found her Beacon on in a random chest in a giants encampment o.o
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!

Too quiet.

(if you are the Streamer)
:U
Woosh.

Beam me up!
I didn't think the stream was quiet. But then again, my volume is at maximum.
Ohhhh i hate this quest....

Woah, you're high up. Don't slip.
He? She?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vovJ-JsK9h4 <-- Great Family Fued Moment
This voice is horrendous. :P
ADDS ugh
Texas.
Uh... Mexico?~
Close enough.
He survived a long fall, hes good
Details, details.
I thought Texas was a poor excuse to kill people for no good reason?
uh oh, only 4 lockpicks left
NOOB PICKLOCKING.
no it's a good excuse to kill people for no reason
Proof?
get the pony mod!!!!
It's the second most populous state in the Union... and until Rick Perry secedes, we're stuck with 'em.
^
But one moment anyway.
I'm from NY, you have no idea how nice it would be if Texas left and California fell into the sea.
I'm gonna go for now, I'll talk to everyone when I get home from work. Bye Everypony!
bye!
Must be a mod.
Expecto Patronum!
There's this mod where all the dragons are replaced by fluttershy
Kill dragons just by shouting! You can even have a beard!
yes there is
I saw that one.
How horrifying.
^
*gets knocked back*
When I get Skyrim, I'm gonna download the Fluttershy mod.
I want a beard~!
But but but...That means killing Fluttershy :(
They are~
D8>
i got stuck in the same room :D
D8
pssht
IT'S A TRAP!!
Goddesses, I'm going to need some headache pills. Be back in a jiffy.
Be back later everypony.
Needs a mod that turns all dragons to spike
how long did this Stream go on?!
then I could kill them
ta ta Dashie~
Why would you want to kill Spike? :(
Apperently everyone at my school hates spike~
I don't know why~
You should just remind him to be generous!
he didnt touch the pedestal...
i think he did
"I suppose you'll be eating me now, or something" and then NOTHING sexual happened.
use the force!
last lockpick
lol
there it goes
When having a very low ammount of lockpicks always save~
you pansy!
lol
