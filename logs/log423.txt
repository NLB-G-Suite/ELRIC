TheRainbowDash: u are a very nice pony, i know you dont really mean that
This is like Guitar Hero meets DJ Hero meets Japan.:D
........AT LEAST ''WE GOTTA POWER''?
AAAAAAAA
Their method for determining who was supposedly affected was, on the next day to ask school kids "Did you feel sick after watching Pokemon last night? If so, you can go home early."
no im not AND I WILLL NEVER BE
What am I watching... O_O
Oh my...
Guess what the kids said?
So gonna watch it

DocSane: porn?

otakon he dropped the quality to compensate for all the stuff hapening on the screen
haha this is so distracting! I'm tryin to animate here
LunaTheBeloved: i think i might die from lack of oxygen im laughin so hard
CCCP: I have changed in the past few days, now do not respond back to me.

LOL
oh

Pop music festival XXXX?
WE. ARE FAMILY!!!!

Vinyl: My nick is for my name, and my nature :P
/me abandons stream
This is awesome and all.....but I'm gonna finish watching Community
Automated computer Left, Automated computer Right, station computer Left, station computer Right
hmm i'll be the ghost of a ghost...neat
TheRainbowDash: :'( well i guess if you dont wub me then i wont talk to u any more
100% left or 100% right means 50% modulation
We Are Fa-Mi-Ly!
1,3does the actual timing of the music seem off to anyone else? ignoring lag
and when I turned what I thougth were channels 3 and 4 on
/me pulls Renard back
TrololoVinyl and Vinyl What is this madness?:D
it was actually 2 and 3
CCCP: EPIC WUB TIME
but i still wub u
the automated computer was off
the one called excatly what I typed out
so therefore, left only
I caught it during my second song
kirzstryfe, the timing solely depends on what the player do
and turned 4 on
It seems off for me
kirzstryfe: it's not the original track I'm sure
We Are FAmily! I Got All My Bronies With ME!!! :)
TrololoVinyl: Make it TrololoTroll :D I'm getting pinged for people pinging you
lol weirdest rhythm game ever
CCCP: Sure thing then.....(Gray Dash, but that ego will go away after today:)) *winks*
/me hugs EVERPONY!! :[
/me ignore TheRainbowDash
That's the good point of Pop'N, you actually "play" the music, you're not simply following a beat
Why arnt we watching King of The Hill :(

Performs a Stone Cold Stunner on CCCP

That death animation is horrifying. The moment of impact and his death are separated by almost a second. It's almost as if he could struggle for survival, but there's no way to survive once he's been slightly injured.
Dat Violin ?
Im worried that SB64 wont get past the dark underwater section :(
dat Banjo
Dark92Enigma: I'm going to Raw on monday.
TheRainbiwDash I got 6 plasma monkeys :)

SuperBrony64: can link a youtube video?
Darf14, still not as bad as the underwater level in TMNT

PIRATES

inb4 ragequit
CCCP You will hate me for this----- It'S A wrestling move

00,10what the evil trap that you just run to the left instead of to the right?
Season 2 is over, you guys
Alister: Pretty much, not that hard to make.

Sadly the moment I beat IWBTG platformers are a little easy for me ..... I regret playing that game

DeathStar: http://memegenerator.net/instance/19235262?browsingOrder=New&browsingTimeSpan=Today
yeah iduno
DeathStar: Seems legit
SuperBrony64 is bad at being British.
SuperBrony64: what are you saying
aw poor SuperBrony64
Bye Java
Hmm, gears. You know, there's probably a hidden final boss and to find him you gotta get all those gears.
what game is next
No kidding: that face is so heartbreaking :(
SuperBrony64: which title is that?
does this guy have a Melee disc
MahBoi777:
Dont look down on yourself SuperBrony64 , you were doing good
surround albums are spread between DVDA and SACD zo if it's on one it's usually not on the other
actually Marx no
oh, cool
also wtf at iTunes crashing
Marx: He's probably not as freaky as 02
/me DeathStar oh you
Ooh, what are we playing next?
Ok guys i have a game
Shane377:
Well everypony, I'm going on to Round 100 on BTD4, any last words?
MahBoi777: you and my sis DeathStar should http://memegenerator.net/instance/19235262?browsingOrder=New&browsingTimeSpan=Today
it's been doing it ever since I installed OSX on this
oh
getting all the gears only gets you a challenge room
Lets play guess the game
Insert a DEESK
i would suggest some classical ones but you'r not that into classical
Well, don't reveal anything about it. I'm gonna get the game and see for myself.
u know what sucks???? getting killed by a metapod..... and we all know thats impossible
cachi01, agreed
Every on paste whatever they have copied
Does copycat work for the turn before it or is it only for the current turn?
I'm into like, movie scores
Shane377: WUT O_o
SSBB time?
www.totaljerkface.com/happy_wheels.php
cachi01 well, if the metapod uses struggle...
I predict.....Super Smash bros Brawl
you might find 1 or 2 of those in SACD in your lib
cachi01: Actually it's not.
insert DEESK to give a TWEEST to ZEE DEEEKS
MahBoi777: http://memegenerator.net/instance/19235262?browsingOrder=New&browsingTimeSpan=Today
Shane377: O.O
Biglaw: HARDEN
I searched for SACD, no results
Brawl. Brawl. Brawl. Brawl!
is it surround?
*DEESK
If it evolved from a Caterpie, it would know an attacking move
yes
Brawl! BRAWL!
Shane377: http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2ypxbZEuj1rnl2pl.jpg
which album
most SACDs are surround
MahBoi777: and DeathStar you kno what i mean http://memegenerator.net/instance/19235262?browsingOrder=New&browsingTimeSpan=Today lol
WindWhistler: harden cant kill you
toys th the attic iirc
I'm not happy I'm losing due to cheap tactics
I think that's the crappy one LOL
*in
SSBM?
cachi01 once a pokemion has used up its PP on all moves, it uses struggle, which deals damage
please
gamecube?
oh GC
AWWW YEAH
Methinks Kirby Air Ride
OH BOY
Shane377: NOBODY KNOWS WHAT YOU MEAN :[
does anyone here know how to turn a video clip into a gif?
THE SUSPENSE
Kirby AirRide/
Hmm...a unkown Game Cube game :)
?
hey Petrified_Discord!
cachi01: You're assuming Metapod ONLY knows Harden. But it doesn't.
Air Ride or Melee
Biglaw: O_O
hey bronies! quick shoutout on my 21st bday before I go out
ohai MahBoi777
butanyway chnaces are what you WANT and what you can FIND are completely different

I played the crap out of City Trial.
I Called It!
hey CCCP
/me Petrified_Discord: i remember that trip sigh good times
OOOOOOOOH YEAAH
thanks DeathStar
DO FREE RUN
some SACDs are stereo onry
Fuck this brings a shitload of memories
Who didn't LOVE this game?
so then what's the point
That mode can be crazy.
CrimsonPhoenix: Haters.
One of my favorite games of all time
WHY WUB THIS GAME
Petrified_Discord: someone is impersonating you
I want some surround sound rock :P
CITY TRIAL
My siblings always hated Free Run
WindWhistler: uhmmm harden? lol
CITY TRIAL FREE RUN
City Trial is best mode
MahBoi777: I noticed :)
>Tut
WindWhistler: WHAT?!
I hate when metaknight and dedede die you are out of luck
50%+ of SACDs/DVdaS are classical
i actually really like this game
compact star}!1
just go to the library, check for rounded edge cases
...Judging by the chatroom, is this Kirby Air Ride? O_O
Gah I demand a rematch I only lost because of spore
CCCP: everyone loves this game :D
I highly doubt the yhave them
Petrified_Discord: alright, lol:D
as SACDs cost a lot more?
MahBoi777: and DeathStar this MahBoi777 to DeathStar http://www.google.com.au/imgres?q=if+you+know+what+i+mean&start=76&um=1&hl=en&sa=X&rlz=1C1MDNA_enAU416AU417&biw=1600&bih=813&tbm=isch&tbnid=SVvOq2gVXfOzFM:&imgrefurl=http://memegenerator.net/instance/16670267&docid=ENdgHpnkuptStM&imgurl=http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/16670267.jpg&w=400&h=400&ei=EsWcT8ThIs2biQfwxf3fDg&zoom=1&iact=hc&vpx=370&vpy=325&dur=3997&hovh=225&hovw=225&tx=118

Fun Fact, Kirby Return to dreamland was going to be on Game cube, but It suffered from a very long time in limbow until it came out on the Wii
CCCP: Who doesn't like this game?

CCCP: :O How dare they
They should remake this game for the Wii
this is MahBoi777 talking to DeathStar http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/16670267.jpg
http://derpy.me/ is a good way to shorten your URLs.
Does anyone want to try a bloody and gory game based apon Ripping of arms and legs while riding verious things?
Shane377: dat Mr. Bean xD
I'm tempted to go to ponychat just so I can see who it is...
When you run out of health as metaknight or dededem your out for good
MrBen: lets make a petition
i found about 35 SACDs in my city lib
Specifically for online multiplayer
well I can't go to the library right now
Specifically, ones underground in Whispy Woods Woods, near the waterfall, outside Castle Hall, and inside the Volcano
Do the most minutes on the ga- ..never mind

Shibakuzou_WallDives: I'll battle you
I never went in rails
Marx, I have been.
Marx: It pretty much kills you
ever
I know that feeling Marx
I think it happened to me once too.
I remember having battles with my friends on this game, it was so much fun.
More than once, IIRC
Marx, you can just charge until the event is over
MahBoi777: what ever do you mean ? ;)

I hated the wheelies so much
Actually, you can't do that I believe.

You know what my favorite and yet most frustrating event here is, IMO?
I'm using Mibbit
drf|osx accept
I would always attack the trees, then feel bad for making whispy cry.
We always called the Wheelie Scooter the Fagio
You can try, but I think you still move.
Spectrum_Rush: lol I kno ur secret
