05physically
huh, so that happened
05cut
05the line
heh that a big words ponies47
is the single
Wrek: Oh dear :S
most stupid
THE WORST THING EVA!!!
05but they're an awesoem provider
fucking thing I have ever heard anyone d
Dun...Dun...Dun!
05they solved it in a matter of minutes
Moopy: It's not that hard to do :P
hmmm
and I now stupid things! I'm 15 for crying out loud!
ah, well at least they were quick about it
uh oh

You love metal don't you scottish-geeky? :3
05worst part is thati jsut had gotten the group xD
Swedish metal is best metal.
Ponies47: it the muisc of gods
What group is this?

As in, the band.

Kammerjunk: metal is metal man
Wrek: what server ja on again?
05Quel'thalas
FRESH BREAD
dude, you totally need to get guild wars 2. it's like wow but better. and no monthly cost
Im still getting Halo 4
GW2 hasn't been out long enough to decide it's better than anything.
Moopy: it looks good
Though I'm personally enjoying it so far.
heck yeah all my friends are fetting it
05i dont have time for anotehr MMO
05adn it looked meh at best
i mean getting it
I should probably look up some of the info for my classes now that 5.0.4 has hit.
I took the x's out of my username
Wrek: im there but you seem ta not be here :O
05Prick: EU
GW2 is pretty good. I'm definitely going to put a chunk of time into it, but WoW will still be my #1.

MadSurge: you dont happen to be familiar with this sc mode right now?
Ponies47: be nice to lord Sumica

Sumica, thats not *imposible* but adding it to mirc would be a smidge hard, i might try adding it to xchat
Ponies47: it might be lad but u dont want to upset thay masters do yee

Dark_Horst: nope, I don't like RTS games :P
Ponies47: lol good choies mate
MadSurge: you never had age of empires?

Hey trollghost
Hello there trollghost
guys, i been thinking
trollghost: ello mate
05heres to hopign for competent team members
scottish-geeky: It's caleld punishment. I was a bad pony :(
*called
Dark_Horst: I grew up in arcades, so I'm much better at action games :D
Ponies47: how wer u bad lad
and in 2 episodes of mlp, rarity says "rainbow wont look like a tank" and rainbows pet is called tank
trollghost: and
scottish-geeky: Remeber the tomato throwing
so if they know the word tank, then maybe there was a war between humans and ponies?
MadSurge: well, rts are not my favourite genre, but seeing how red alert 2 was the first thing i seriously played, it's one of them^^
Ponies47: ahh .....
inb4 Adventure Time metaphor
inb4 DERRRP
and ponies far in our future were geneticfally engineered to do magic for us and be self aware
Anyways it's almost 3:00 AM time for bed. Night everypony :)
i still dont get the inb4 thing
Goodnight Ponies47
then they fought back against us, won because you know, magic, and populated the world with happiness and friendship!
Ponies47: night mate sleep well may luna gard your slumber
trollghost, reminds me of a fanfic called Anthropology
just minus the fighting
also, does pony world (not just equestria) have time zones?
well im head of as well nitie evry pony
Night scottish-geeky
nithe AdamTheDuck
and if there are more regions than equestria, do they each have there own princess's that raise a localized moon and sun to fit their time zones?
we need an mlp episode that explains this kind of important stuff.
trollghost, Celestia's reign is a monarchy
FOR LUNA
/me salutes!
im going to lay down on my red bean bag and watch the stream and the chat now
AdamTheDuck how is it a monarchy if she lives and reigns essentially forever?
Wait... isn't a monarchy when there is only one leader?
well AdamTheDuck thats a good question
inb4 oligarchy?
a dictatorship is a "political" method of someone ruling a country or province by there own,
while a monarchy is a "religous" method of someone ruling a country or province by blood, e.g. our rolyal family (even though they have little to no control over the country now)
Ahhhhhhhhh I see
/me slaps AdamTheDuck around a bit with a large trout
but still, in the royal family there is a dictator (the king/quenn [usually king])
MUTINY
all of the uks king and queens have been, to say the least, crap
and thats why parliment will always be better
Reminds me of the time when I wiki'd anarchy to find how the anarchy symbol had anything to do with anarchy and scrolled down to a section that had "Leaders of anarchy groups".
And I was thinking: wait a second...
Isn't anarchy supposed to have no leaders? 6_9
well
anarchy and anonymous are 2 different things woven together
anarchy is just messing shit up all through time
and anonymous (which started as a troll that succeded on /b/) is a group that messes shit up through anarchy
I still haven't got a clue why that 'A' is the symbol for anarchy. :3
SuperBrony64: is a fridge
So yeah good night wubs and all that other (squee)
Aren't you asleep yet Ponies47 ?
AdamTheDuck: I never fall asleep right away! :D
Ain't no sleep for the wicked.
Munay don't grow on trees
I got bills to pay
Got mouths to feed and ain't nothing in this world comes free
i got crowds to please
Gold star for AdamTheDuck.
Oh well you can't stop now, you can't hold back although you know I wish I could
Hmm, what was next?...

Hello therainbowvortex

If you mean signed up, then yes I am.
^
how you doing therainbowvortex
i tried to sing up but i kept saying my email was wrong what type of email do u use
Gmail therainbowvortex
alexxm im good thx
I use Live
What, we are naked...
...
Yes Sabershy, we're all naked.
Chat derped? :$
Speak for yourself, I'm not naked.
/me strips
Awkward moment when we all realise that Ponyville is a nudist colony...
My chat was stuck at 0:43 :P
adamthe duck i used my email vortex1996@live.com and i wouldent work mabby i sing up to gmail
brb
Goodnight everypony! I'm out of here!
Night pol - damnit everyone leaves too quickly
Night all
AdamTheDuck: well, they don't need clothes :D
Night Panda|sleepies
Huzzah~
Goodnight Panda|sleepies , yay I said goodnight to someone
hye Panda|sleepies
There's a zombie on your lawn, we don't want zombies on the lawn~
Plant some sunflowers and peashooters.
good night to you too AdamTheDuck ^^ and everyone else xD
Jmo: that game rocks :$
I know right ;D
:'(:'( im stupid and i dont know how to make a gmail
Jmo, did you say that you managed to sign up to fim fiction?
wut
Wrong person bro.
right.
I'm signed up for FIMFiction though.
And you said you use Live?
Mhmm
Because therainbowvortex couldn't sign up with his/her live but you still managed I'm assuming :?
:/*
Several things: His email could of been entered incorrectly, his email is already registered or the website was being an arse at the time.
Other then that I would have no idea.
^
He would have to contact Knighty or someone else.
im so geting pissed off i just tried to register again but would it let me noo
Well what does it say?
What exactly is the issue you're having during registration?
Are you not entering something correctly? A field is empty and requires filling?
my email it says its wrong but i cheeked it it corect
Is this during registration on Fimfiction?
or on Gmail?
yes
fimfiction
What does the sign up exactly say? "The email you entered is incorrect"?
or something similar to that
it has an x next to my email name
mabby its my compter
Are you trying to enter your email into the username field? <_>
Most likely not.
nope
maybe just copy+paste your email across
ill try that
that way there will not be any error in spelling from when you log on your gmail
I still have no idea what language wrek's songs are in :D
adamtheduck i dont have a gmail i couldent figer out how to sing up
right
I'm not sure then
05therainbowvortex: its spelled "sign"
as long as it has @live.com or whatnot at the end it should send an email even if that email exists or not
Back to my maths homework I go :P
burn the homework
thats it i quit
it not gona work
therainbowvortex, You don't really need an account to read the fics anyway :3
05bronystate gotta get a "VHS" image identification
05dont recognize what it is?
05cant join chat
05>:3
Wait.. what's VHS?
/me slaps AdamTheDuck around a bit with a large trout
i used the same thing to sign in i got into my email but not on to fimfiction
Oh is that one of those type in what the image spells image thingy?
05nah AdamTheDuck you'll see an image and gotta type in waht i t is
so dose any one have a good fanfic i should read read my little dashie and squals cupcakes :O and rainbow factor
therainbowvortex, Anthropology is cool if you like Lyra
lyra is cool the only ponys form the show i dont like is trixe and that grifon gilda

Hi everypony
Hello there Pinkie_Brony
We are all ded
or taking a nap
either way chat is quiet
AdamTheDuck: XD okai
wonder where Wrek got to
He's under your bed. o.o
D:
Phase4, Wrek's still playing isn't he?
oh there he is
AdamTheDuck, i was reloading the stream, assumed he wasnt because of dead chat
Nah I just killed everyone.
/me stares into your soul with a twisted smile.
D:
AHM NOT DEAD
/me slaps MadSurge around a bit with a large trout
/me noms on MadSurge and Jmo
Raggle fraggle.
You don't slap people with fish, you eat it! :[
/me slaps a fish with MadSurge.
Meanwhile: that's better :D
Also hello!
/me noms on all the fish
Urgh. It's too early in the morning to be awake.
Meanwhile: how much early?
It's...coming up to midday.
So I've been awake for nearly 20 hours.
Meanwhile: It's past noon here
Meanwhile: Solid.
I'm wondering if I can tank through it to go to sleep at a loony hour later so I can wake up in good time for the movies.
Or... COFFEE
I hate coffee.
Meanwhile: it's not friday! D>
:<
I know, it's Friday tomorrow.
Thus the point of going to sleep /later/
Coffee can die.
/me kills Jmo for saying that!
NO BAD
/me slaps AdamTheDuck around a bit with a large trout
/me slaps Jmo's dead body with a Jmo's secret stash of large trouts!
Tea > Coffee
Sup AdamTheDuck.
You know, I've never had tea before...
wat
Unless that tea from that Chineses restaurant counts
YAY I WON A FREE IPHONE 4S... Aaaand it's a virus -_-

Sorry
Malk: :) I'm doing alright - getting ready for...something
Sumica, i blame your hl2.exe for our failings

00,10welcome to my world
Sumica the chat is your world
With all the other mods as the rulers
00,10no the world of cant play MvM with friends cause game crashed
I didn't quite understand that comment but ok. :)
Im heading out - not sure how long this will last
Bye cy - :| why do they always leave before I get to say goodbye
Sumica Meanwhile is having graphic lag, only me and Phase4 now with some randoms
The day I get a life is when I'll stop coming to this chat.
I'm on this everyday.
^
It's just not plausible to play properly like that.
Who needs a life when you have ponies :P
I turn so slow that spies in front me can move around me.
I got a new computer. The day I got it, my brother says "well he isn't going to have a life"
AdamTheDuck, ponies don't pay the bills.
*everyday
Lol. flutter_spin. Yeah I heard you MLP_Bronykiin
Hello flutter_spin! :)
hey. I got like 15min
inb4 Phase4 rage quits
:P
Wait, does wave 7 just keep going on and on?
flutter_spin, No they just keep losing :/
It's bloody hard.
I mean, does it restart or do you keep playing until you win?
flutter_spin, Until you win or rage quit
you keep playing until you win
or everyone quits
Dat troll engy
... Yeah, stock weapons aren't entirely good for MvM
Only a few are good
It is sadly true.
Like heavies minigun and flamethrower (airblast cost)
I'm like "why bother if I can't beat it with standard weapons"
Honestly, I think it would be better to win with very little reward than to lose in trying for a large reward
Just the satisfaction of saying you won.
I see Pony
lol
And I thought chat died more during the night. Feels like no one on right now
flutter_spin: Most people are at work now or back to school now
My bro looked up Guild Wars 2 classes. I think he really wants to play it
Yeah. I'm about to go to work here soon too
So... much... maths homework... :|
last question yay
eh. I slept through my Calculus class. Math was easy for me.
Not when you're doing year 11 maths in year 10 :P
AdamTheDuck: My teacher makes us do that
inb4 Phase4 flips his table

08,01Vordox: there's nowayof stoppingthat actually
08,01apart from playing lots, so that callouses form
I know. =P I played around with guitar before... It just does that.
08,01Vordox: yup

00,02tomorow is worst day
00,02i have 1 lecture
SEXY DUNGEON
00,02its an hour long
Phase4: Oh god, ONE lecture.
08,01im used to cello strings, which have a softer core
PARTY DWARF
00,02takes me, under ideal conditions, half an hour to get to uni
WOOO
00,02and always more than half to get back
So... 2 hours?
08,01also, nylon guitar and ukulele strings
00,02so i'm going to spend more time traveling no matter what i do
UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
I don't know why they have that, deeper sound I guess.
Derpy! :D
08,01what kind of strings?
COUNFOUND THOSE
00,02i *should'nt* skip the lecture
Like the 3 deeper tones on normal Guitar, that kind of string
08,01the strings im currentlyusing are steel an some other metal
00,02but its techincally optional and takes longer to travel than lecture
Phase4: Bring along work on the trip, works for me. :p
08,01Phase4: i know thatfeeling
00,02Vordox, but i've done all my work for this week
00,02got it done nice and early
Phase4: Do some project else then
08,01i live about 30 minutes bike ride out from uni
Nyan nyan nyan <3 The original before Nyan Cat
08,01i hate it when i just have a single lecture
00,02Vordox, but i need internet access for those, and uni internet is not good, plus on the train, mobile internet isnt that good
08,01buuut, we have 24 hour accescomputer labs
Feeeeel so.....tired. :/
Phase4: er, your own project you can do on your self without connection
08,01also, we have f\aaaast internet at ni
'cause maybeeee, you're going to be the one that saves meeeee
08,01*uni
00,02theres a few things i could do but less than ideal
I live 20 minute bus ride from gymnasium (The level of education, not the place you go to work out), it's alright.
Phase4: Do some advanced coding then. :P

Vordox: Some one already has :D

I honestly think This Day Aria gets to much praise. It's a good song, but there are too many remixes of it. It's kind of annoying.
People have too much time, including me :p

/me Giggles
Buytoast: Even if it was the opposite it wouldn't be fun
Buytoast: because this is a behind the sences
Scoot-Scootaloo: Andd they are playing in the LIGHT, they should have darkened the room
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Vocal Music: Luna's Lullaby / Great and Powerful / The Adventurer
well of course it wouldn't be fun, but it'd be slightly easier to watch instead of seeing two kids overreact obnoxiously
Buytoast: Slender, the perfect cat jumping on a piano simulator :D
<--- are that ACTUAL reaction
Wow, I'm NOT a scaredy cat then
XDD
Vordox: forced reaction is forced

00,10why is tennet coming back SeaponiesofLiverpool?
trollghost tis you ^-^
panda: Hello!
AJIsAwesome! Hiya

There is a new dr who episode?
I just realized it is spelled Mane in Mane chat

I am slow
00,10that would explane the 15 hr marathon on BBC:A
I need to catch up, ive only watched 4 episodes thus far xD
Back and I am shocked! My brother did something for my pets for once! :O
I need to start getting into Doctor Who ;_;
Welcome back Ponies47 :)
Thanks MLP_Brovakiin
Ponies ponies ponies swag :)
00,10Not a fan of what's his arse
Ponies47: Mentioned while my parents start watching a Sylvester McCoy story arc
Sumica: Hotdiggedydemon?
mitamaking: I see.
I didnt know his arse had a name Sumica
Eyemeralds?
00,10the one that thinks fezes and bowties are cool.
Oh, that one doctor.
D: but i like bowties.
/me hops around the room
The current one?
Fezes and bowties are cool anyway
00,10they may be but that doctor is not
I have only seen like the first 5 with him, he seemed fine
I SMELL DOCTOR WHO DISCUSSION
ewwwwww
You have a cool computer there, able to smell discussions
Moopy..... you be eww....
^-^
what does it smell like
I wonder if I have BBC
so what
Season 7, so close yet so far.
;~;
/me sniffs Moopy
I wanna start watching Doctor Who I heard it's really good.
Yup moopy poopy!
ewww get away from me
Ohai Wrek stream
You know im joking with you, right Moopy?
oooo paint programs i love piant programs
yeah
Paint Tool SAI for life.
Wrek time
Wrek! :)
Doctor Who is good, just pick a doctor and start with him
Magic would make sniping too easy, I mean unlimited zoom in and a bullet that could move
^
magic bulletproofness
Which is why twi is OP
your logic is invalid
plus there are no guns in questria
so again, logic invalid
SeaponiesofLiverpool: I think she is sniping Earthponies and Pegasi, why turn on the great unicorn race
There are guns in Wrekquestria.....
pegasi have thunderclouds for sniping as Derpy proved
SeaponiesofLiverpool: If there are no gun in Equestria, how did Pinkie know how to use Twillight like one?
when she nearly assassinated Dash
dat benny hill :D
mitamaking thats a good point.
:O
its just they have different weapons
magic laser weapons.... yes... Lightning guns ... yes
Gotta love th4 benny hill theme
Benny Hill Theme :P
*the
gunpowder..... probably not
/me Runs around the chat
A lightning gun is still a gun
ponies probably don't use gunpowder
as a weapon
They use bone power then?
They don't really need it, again magic
/me starts chasing pretty woman around his apartment complex
*women
*mares
oh no the sea ponies name oh dear god
Poor Benny Hill never got the ladies :D
*mares
Shoobedoo shoo shoo be do
Sho be do shoo shoo be do
Call upon the C pwnies when you're in distress.
Whoa!
Springtime for Hoofler & Germaneigh
I dont chase 'mares' in a pervy way :D I chase Women!
RaveBrony mares are better :3
so D-war is tomorrow... the news is a bit confusing
That theme is going to be stuck in my head all day damn it...
My OC is a staillion but most of pictures I have of him are R63
Panda: Pfffft ;)
Am I the only person who doesn't find Benny Hill funny
Ponies47, I think Sumica has the same issue lol
00,10I have no idea what you could posably meen
Oh hey superbrony64 you there dude
kirzstryfe: Ohai you. I doesn't really bug me. To be honest if I we're a pony I wouldn't mind being a mare :$
just saying, there are a lot of male Sumica pictures, and that's just wrong for your OC
kirzstryfe ^-^ you live!
Ive been working on a pic of my OC for so long :'(
RaveBrony: I have not got one :P
The only picture of my OC that is not R63 is a picture of him as a young little colt
MLP_Brovakiin: Get onee! :o
RaveBrony: Meh I can't draw for shit, and I don't really want to ask for one :(
I used pony maker to make my OC as a young little colt
And I don't know any other way to get an OC :P
MLP_Brovakiin: Just draw what you can! :)
I used Pony Maker as a rough draft, then I change and edit it based on the model I made.
Huzzah! I do have BBC! :3
Sometime in the future Wrek should just draw some guns because I love his attention to detail.
anyone there
?
Oh yeah. I have to go to the dentist today ;_;
Yes we are pony_4071 we are just hiding
D: dont hide from me i need friends
Does everyone have an oc?
mitamaking: I do
Yay I am making my OC right as we speak :)
I have one, but I'm still making changes to it.
hey... hey neil

Malk- its a joke political party
It was on the white board here for liek a month
Ponies47 yes want to go

His wife asked about it, and automatically assume, after we described what a brony was, that it was some sort of perverted thing.
Pearly, that's a wonderful drawing :o
Great job :>
Malk: It's at the end of September. They have a website. TONS of the cast members from the show are going to be there
Barbetos|AtWork wow where do you work you have bronies in the office

*going
Im enjoying it

Goodbye everyone :0
*:)
Bye MLP_Brovakiin
Ponies47: Ooo, congratulations! Hope you find a great computer!
Did you get a set then, or just buy a printer?
Awww, bye MLP_Brovakiin!
GigabitHarmonie: Me to. Hope it will be able to play TF2 good. Unlike the otehr two computers it's installed on.
*other
Hello GigabitHarmonie! :$
/me hugs Pearly. "Sorry. I was busy and forgot... :$"
Hello MadSurge! :)
CrazyCherry: Nice to see you!
GigabitHarmonie: Hallow. :3
Ponies47: I'd be interested in hearing what specs you are looking at!
I bought the printer
CrazyCherry: Hello hello! :) How are you today?
you can send your models to shapeways and they will print them for you
but for the price of printers these days… its pretty affordable and plastic is cheap
Q
GigabitHarmonie: I'm doing good. A little tired though. :/ And do I know you? :D
How much was the printer?
$600
/me hugs CrazyCherry "it's ok"
Huh, that's less than I was expecting. O_o
www.solidoodle.com
theres a huge lead time though
12 weeks id estimate
thats my forum above, if you want to join, its dedicated to solidoodle 3d printing.
CrazyCherry: Not sure you do, but it's always nice to meet new ponies!
/me prints ponies, hasbro goes broke
hahaha lol
Oh, and Pearly! You as well!
Lawl
Undercut them
:P
/me noms on GigabitHarmonie's ear. :3
Guten Tag, everypony!
Oh! My ear!
I have a feeling 3d printing will shake up the whole toy industry
Howdy tSparx
GigabitHarmonie, thank you very much :D
Ah, Guten Tag tSparx. Wie gehts?
CrazyCherry: are you here saturday nights after european movie night?
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Albums: Warfilly / Hell Muffins / Nocturne of the Firmaments / The Science of Friendship / Epic Final Bosses / Let's Buck Sh** Up
also, hi GigabitHarmonie.
What sort of materials can you current use them for, just plastics?
and dat MADSURGE.
Hello WallDives! :)
GigabitHarmonie: It's a desktop that's for sure. What it's goign to have not exactly sure yet (Not much of a computer expert :$) My mom is taking me but my dad wants to tag along to help out (I want him to because the last computer my mom bought (My brother's laptop) she purchased one with AWFUL speakers). So I'm pretty sure the next time you see me I'll most likely be on my new one.
MadSurge: Sometimes. :3
Dat wall of text :$
GigabitHarmonie: Ich bin ko, und dir?
Well for my cheapo $600 printer, it uses ABS plastic
aka the same stuff legos are made out of
Ponies47: Well, I'm a technology specialist, so I'd be able to tell you what you're getting and whether it's a good deal, in the least.
Ahh, cool
or you can use PLA, which is a natural biodegradable plastic made from corn startch
CrazyCherry: GigabitHarmonie does the podcasts with Allegr0
I prefer abs though because it doesnt melt if it gets wet and gives you better quality prints.
MadSurge: Oh. :3
GigabitHarmonie: My dad is a computer expert. He would know what is good and what is not.
But for the more expensive printers
like $50k and up
/me snuggles with GigabitHarmonie
they can use up to 50 different types of materials
and combine them to make analogs and stuff
its crazy.
Hah, damn
I'm not used to associating T-Sparx with guns when Pinkie's not around.
Ponies47, I do too..
my computer is almost 4
http://www.soliforum.com/topic/63/brads-solidoodle-unboxing/
Pearly: My computer is 9 years old -_-
theres my unboxing video if you want to see what the printers look like
tSparx: Gut, vielen Dank! Was hast du heute gemacht?
wow
Also I'm gonna go DOUBLE monitor with this one :3
Hey, I have a laptop that is... um... I don't know how old it is
I can for this one too if I wanted to
Cookie Monster?
Ponies47: Of course, wonderful! I didn't mean to discount your father at all. :)
but would be a dvi monitor
What are the dimensions of the printing area?
/me hugs GigabitHarmonie. "Nice to meet you. I herd you're the one getting the aftermovie things up. :3
GigabitHarmonie: would love to hear you speak german :D
6 inches x 6 inches x 6 inches
GigabitHarmonie: Unterricht, und... das ist es xD
That's a pretty good size
/me hugs pearly and CrazyCherry gently. "Very nice to meet you both, I am a small part of the site doing the podcast and then an occasional radio show."
What does xD mean in German?
GigabitHarmonie: Yay. :3
mitamaking: The same thing it means in English... it's a smiley xD
Is it an angry smiley?
Also, I didn't know you liked mlp
Just got into it hahahaha
Ah that's cool. <:
Ive got no shame in saying its one of the very few rare gems of current animated cartoons.
tSparx|Hwk: Ah, wirklich? Schüler oder Lehrer?
OOOO pidcast, I so miss doing that
GigabitHarmonie: Oh I'm not offended at all. Don't worry. I think my brother is goign to need a new computer soon as well. The laptop he has right now (Which is the one my mom purchased) is starting to act up. For example. I won't update freakin Adobe Flash Player and I have to use that sometimes when I'm at my dad's so I can't really go on the chat when I'm on that computer. -_-
99.9% of TV is absolute garbage.
*going
I wouldn't want my kids watching most of the "childrens" shows they have on these days.
What is with me and walls of text today!?! D:
mitamaking: Reminds me of the French video on youtube that had the top comment, "Why are they laughing in English?!"
The twilight sparkle print is about 4 inches high
GigabitHarmonie: rolling on the floor laughing
RRRRAAAWWWEEEEEERRR!!!!!! :D
RainbowDash90: !
GigabitHarmonie: Schoolwork, all for my Theo class this afternoon.
tSparx|Hwk: Ah. :)
You gunna try and paint it?
Theology?>
/me nuzzles GigabitHarmonie. "It's been a good bit of time since I've last been here. :#"
*Theology?
yes
Have you made a Dash yet? :P
Gotta get the right acrylic paints though in the right colours
Ill do a dash tonight
05hows that?
CrazyCherry: Ikr? Where have you been?
mitamaking: Yep yep. One of my majors :)
Hahaha, sweet
dash has more pieces though so it should take longer
Wrek: FUCK. YEEAAAAAAHHHHH!
The squares are easy to notice
Ooh, I do enjoy typing in smileys and getting ponies :D
If you want one ill make you one and send it to you.
MadSurge: Not here. XD
They dont cost very much to make.
>_><_< <---when did these get added?
Wrek: So awesome! /)^3^(\
That would be brilliant, thanks
mitamaking: Few weeks ago
Firefox is acting janky today, which means I'm gonna have to restart my comp, but that's a big pain on my system for reasons I don't fully understand.
So I'm on Chrome right now, using the embed client, which means I get to enjoy this --> :)
Just so you know, I can say that you will love the next [insert_genre_here] music hour! :)
I just dont have a rarity model yet
, Trixie, and Sweetiebelle
the mane is screwing up my printer
too many thin walls
Ahh
Plus Derpy, Trixie, and Swetiebelle
when it does work, im going to have to glue together like 10 pieces
that was weird
not really a big deal though.
...
Dash has I think… 5 or 6 pieces
twilight had 4
Damn laptop Derping like crazy...
GigabitHarmonie: Okie.
:3
Maybe it's the 18 GBs of Derpy pic I saved up on this 6gb laptop. :P
MASF123: It just doesn't know what went wrong.
pics
18Gbs on a 6Gb laptop?
MASF123 xD only with derpy that is possible
are you in US or UK? I forgot
Where did the other 12Gb get stored?
Derpy flew north for the winter!
havent talked to spyro community people forever.
Yup I had to keep smacking the monitor to make it save up that much data.
Did you also download more ram to process it? :b
(Don't question it, it's derpy-hooves :P)
UK, do you have paypal?
Ye- ....uh no. :(
She's the only other person who gets that mantra, besides Pinkie.
yes
also for what its worth
brb
http://i.imgur.com/dSnVX.jpg
Help. I accidentaly 18 gb derpy? Is this dangerous?
3 hour print, 1 piece
wings didnt work.
no
Hah, that's awesome
It'd be cool to see an ep where Pinkie and Derpy chill out xD
printed too small though
Some people want to see less of Pinkie actually. :/
What character would you like?
oh!
Definitely Dash. :P
AJIsAwesome did you see it?
MASF123: That's great for them. *I* couldn't get enough of Pinkie if they tried! :O
Ill make one tonight.
I disconnected before so sorry.
Ill leave it white though.
you can paint it if you want.
Ill glue all the pieces together.
I think Pinkie gets average screentime.
Some people exaggerate
Twilight and RD get the most IMO.
The only character I don't feel gets enough screentime is actually Fluttershy. Screen time and character development.
I made some ABS cement, it works great, can hardly tell they are glued together
I would like to see less Twi and more background ponies plz.
if you sand the models after they turn out even better.
o_o
MASF123: but... IT'S PINKIE! :O How could you hate her?
AJ gets the least
MASF123: Well, it makes sense for T-Sparx to get a lot of screentime, she's the official mane character.
yeah... I don't really bother about what character gets how much screentime, I just watch the show
Yeah, they look gerat
great*
MadSurge: he doesn't
I bet someone's actually done, like, an official count.
I wish we get more Applejack too :D
I wish I had one of the new ZCorp 3d printers.. they do full color printing.
How much screentime, how much dialogue time.
Hah
I just watched that
I just want more ponies period ,3
XD
<3 *
But im not $75k rich.
LOL
/me rimshots tSparx
zcorp is alright for models
but for anything functional
its very very expensive.
Its not a real plastic, zcorps use fused powder.
tSparx: you're lucky you didnt say that on 4chan or something
I want more Applejack and Fluttershy. Less RD and Twi plz
That wrench cost over $200 in powder and binding agent.
Pinkie, less or more it's fine by me.
1kg of ABS plastic for my printer costs <$50
Pyroid: I think I can handle 4chan. I don't actually care about anyone there :
:P*
Applejack is the shortchanged one
Hahahaha, wow
tSparx: haha lol
Look up "objet 3d printer"
I think season 2 had a bit too much Pinkie and Fluttershy
and be amazed. Objet makes the best ones, very expensive, but the models can be function, tough, and look good.
Lol. That's a funny joke. mitamaking
Yeah, I really misspoke earlier. I don't think Fluttershy has the least screentime.
But, I feel like she's the least developed as a character.
00,10needs more augments wrek
/me Returns
yeah, i would agree on that
So how the printers work, do the start at the bottom and work up in small layers?
Twillight is the lead, she will get the most, I get that, but maybe it is because of what people choose here but it seems Flutter and Pinkie get a lot of epsiodes
AJ is least developed
She's #5 on my ranking of the mane6, so I don't say that from a place of bias.
anyone up for some MvM? and hello ponies :)
yes
She takes 4th place for me Twi is pretty meh for me.
Hey BronyInstrumental
Good evening
FDM printers work that way
Fused Disposition Modeling.
MASF123: me too :|
Theres a different kind of printer that works backwards
O_o
and the model is up side down
Hey BronyInstrumental
Oh no no, we're not gonna get into a ranking discussion again, haha
In order I would guess in episodes, 1.Twi 2.Pinkie 3.Rainbow Dash 4.Fluttershy 5.Rarity 6.Appleajck, and there is also the CMCs
Or was it 5th place she took? :/
No no no
and theres a pool of special photo-curing resin
BronyInstrumental: hello, and i'll play mvm
NO NO NO
Let me count...
that it dips into and stuff
Pyroid: cool, add me on steam
its crazy, its made for super high resolution prints, but it takes a very very long time to print anything
DON'T WASTE OUR TIME WITH IT, we all have different opinions on ponies, we *just* did this yesterday, didn't we?
And in the CMC Applebloom has had two and Sweetie one
Back with some Fettucini Alfredo. What did I miss?
and the finished prints are not very strong.
Didn't somepont do the math on screentime
Pinkie>Rainbow Dash>Fluttershy>Applejack>Twilight Sparkle>Rarity.... Yup Twi is 5th for me...my bad.
*somepony
BronyInstrumental: just added you
Are we having this "Best Pony" argument again?:|
mitamaking: It seems likely, but I've never seen it.
Yeah, really, let's not do this.
AJIsAwesome: /)
tSparx: (\
I read it once, I want it on me now to use in this discussion
Wait a second
I was wathcing a video of one of the objet printers
mitamaking: Yeah, I wish I had that too.
Well you can't be developed if you are not on screen
And at the end they started showing Doctor Who monster costumes under 'entertainment', as though it was a showcase of what it can do
Damn disconnect
mitamaking: True, but you can fail to be developed even on screen
They used them to make some of the monsters in Doctor Who?
I remember Twi was number one and Pinkie was most concentrated in one episode(Friend in Deed)
Because that would be fucking awesome
I think Twi and RD should get their own show.
tSparx: Applejack proves that, she was in a lot of the Royal Wedding I noticed rewatching it
AJ should develope more off screen ;)
mitamaking: Yeah, AJ in Royal Wedding's a *great* example of ponies being on screen but not being developed.
I like Rarity how she is :)
Character Development =/= Character Growth.
Char. Development's all about the relationship with the audience growing
At its most basic, it's learning about the char's
What were AJ's episodes in season 2? SSCS6000 and the one where Derpy stole all the headlines
Yep
mitamaking: There was The Last Roundup (or was that ssn1?)
anyone feel up for some MvM?
Last Roundup was the Derpy episode right?
Eeyup.
SSCS6000 is mainly remembered for the song anyway
08,01moar beer
Twi and RD should get their own show.
I freakin hate the song "Call Me Maybe" but the version we're the MLP FIM cast sings it. I'll accpect that.
Hello, GigabitHarmonie.
Hello AJIsAwesome! :)
hallow GigabitHarmonie :3
08,01fuck that, derpy should get her own spinoff
How do you put them up so fast
I am not a dr who fan
that be funny
so I wouldnt know
MLD
but they used them for all sorts of crazy stuff
my little derpy
BronyInstrumental: ! Nice to see you!
05howssat? :D
/me hugs GigabitHarmonie
Wrek: I don't get the squares
My Little Pony: Derpy Is Magic (The movie)
AJ deserves a movie
They all deserve a movie
/me hugs Pearly! :)
I don't like Rarity much, but I named my White horse in RED DEAD REDEMPTION Rarity.
Very nice, Wrek! Love all the design but into the background :o
That was weird.......guess I have to be in Ghost mode now.:S
/me snuggles GigabitHarmonie
:D
Wrek, looks fantastic, I really like the detail as always. It's an awesome weapon asw ell!
Damn, this is cool
what is this link
so I can book mark it
/me clops at Wrek.
Lol. I take it back Twilight isn't overrated anymore. Derpy is.
MASF123|: Oh easy
Can't even get her name right
Little known fact: this is actually a German cover of Old-Fashioned Love Song :P
O need to get Red Dead
well done Wrek
I
My Little Derpy! My Little Derpy! Muuuuufffffffiiiinnnnnssss! My Little Derpy! I use to wonder what muffins could be! Until you all shared your muffins with me! Big huffins! Tons of muffins! I just don't know what went wrong! You ok Rainbow Dash!?!, Yeah Applejack whoo hoo!,, and muffins makes it all complete! My My Little DERPY! Do you know your my favorite muffins~! :D
mitamaking Who?
Dat wall of text.
MASF123|: Ditzy Doo
I might ask someone later today
Dat Wall of Spam
kill me now
it hurts too much
mitamaking her name is Derpy!
suddenly wall of text
MASF123|: No it is not
It's not spam. It's how I would see Derpy's theme
Ponies47, is it Derpy Hooves or Ditzy Doo?
hello everypony
MASF123|: does it matter? :3
how you doing CCCP
MadSurge yes it does
Hey CCCP
good alexxm
Hey CCCP! :$
Hey Socialist State of Soviet Russia
sorry if I got you addicted :P
hello RaveBrony and MadSurge :)
CCCP: Hello!
hiya CCCP
good evening
hello tSparx AJIsAwesome_ and BronyInstrumental ty
I heard somewhere that Luna was best pony
MASF123|: It's Derpy of coarse! :D
Hey CCCP :3
Hi guys
hallo Ponies47 :3
hello Anotherguy!
Derpy Doo was said by one of the creators.
I will call her Derpy, but I consider her real name Ditzy, Derpy is horribly insulting, and just shows how big of an a** Rainbow is calling her that
hello CCCP
There goes my savings for university. :P
mitamaking, are you feeling ok?
Mitamaking: I'm pretty sure *we* named her that, like, Bronies named her that
what is Wrek drawing now?
mitamaking you trolling?
tSparx: I know, it's still insulrting
I'm awfully bored
How is the name Derpy not an insult?
Either trlling or plain stupid...I can't tell.
trolling
mitamaking: Derpy isn't an insult, it's a term to represent misangled eyes.
no no
mitamaking: people with real mental disabilties dont find derpy insulting
could be stupid
mitamaking: In what way? And even if it is, in what way is ditzy *not* insulting?
it's very possible when dealing with these people
Lol. Buytoast
Well people get offended by offended by everything
oops
/me slaps CCCP around a bit with a large trout
derp
Like that.
/me seduces Jmo
Derpy doesn't really mean anything anyway... I like both Derpy and Ditzy tbh
Not one muffin was given that day.
lawl
I get offended by people being offended by Derpy.
Are you still into lasers then?
I like derpy
i get offended by bronies
I should call her " Grey Mare", but it's too insulting
Lol. CCCP
and freedom
Anotherguy: but the Mayor is already a grey mare :D
We could call her Bubbles.
All the grey people in the world will feel insulted
mitamaking: If you check the DERP section of Memebase, you'll see the trademark term of "derp" is mispositioned eyes. That doesn't mean she's retardede. I know many people who have mispositioned eyes, but they're in no way stupid or have disabilities. They act and behave the same way normal humans do.
*retarted*
I jyst like cartoon characters in general
just*
05anyone got a request?

Hello Chrysalis!

Chrysalis: Hello!
FINALLY got a working mouse :D
Chrysalis: How is it?
Hey Chrysalis!
A worker mouse?
Chrysalis: good for you!
a week without a mouse is not a pleasant experience
I am afraid of where we are going with this
Lawl, I love how everyone's more excited by the *presence* of clothes xD
good evening
tSparx: IKR?:D
tSparx thats because socks are hot
Like, true to the original style of animation.
Like a oven
Hello again :)
Ovens are hawt
tSparx: the only franchise were DRESSING the characters makes them sexier :D
Hey Brovakiin
I'm probably the only one in here who doesn't think socks are hot.:D
AJI
There is one in particular that stands out in my mind as very well made
AJIsAwesome: Nope, me too
AJIsAwesome: Dude they cover feet
MadSurge: ... sexier?
Can't really tell it's not from an ep
i think its time to play some tf2
Sexier
it has been FAR too long
Confound these sexy ponies
MadSurge: Haha, absolutley :D
Chrysalis wish i could join you
:$
Panda its a free game
Lyra?
that barely uses any bandwidth
Chrysalis: Oh you have Steam? O.O
Ponies47 of course
AJIsAwesome and pony_4050: I don't think ponies are sexy in any way though :D
Steam! I liek steam
Chrysalis: What's your Steam? :D
MadSurge: sure....
MadSurge: That too, haha
does anyone do a series or just kind of funny short clips
lol MadSurge
mitamaking: no really, humans are far sexier :D
I would never find a pony attractive...never
It would be awesome if they released their adobe flash tool set for the shows hahaha
Let's say you are turned into a pony, what then?
MrPoniator would fit that bill
I wouldn't say *never*, it's a big weird world, but it certainly hasn't happened before.
mitamaking: Then I would never find a human attractive...never
Chrysalis as I said, i am stuck on my phone while my comp is being fixed :$
MAYBE, but that's very unlikely :D
Alright, let's calm down. We don't want another incident like yesterday.:|

I'd probably think about what else I could spend the money on
AJIsAwesome: Just enjoying some lunch. xD
Cool shit like 3d printers.

05probably try a lipbite aswell
xD Naughty.
*pomf*
00,10nice who ever recomended this =p
and it came out a lot smaller than I expected heh.
Ah yeah, I saw it in one of the threads you linked
so no one wants to play MvM?
So which of the main 6 have you not made yet?
Dash and Rarity?
alexxm: My paretns are recently divorce so my dad cut off cable and internet because my mom wont be able to afford it.
It would seem not, BronyInstrumental
MvM
MvM?
Ive only made twilight and AJ
Mann vs Machine
tf2
Ah
yeah
I got my printer not too long ago
oh
nah
so still learning a few things.
So you've just been playing around with it since you got it
XD
aj was done all in one print though
yes
I havent done anything useful with it hahaha
I have not tried Mann vs Machine yet. Is it a lot of fun?
but if you do them all in one print, it puts support material under them, and it doesnt come out as good.
Wrek: has anyone told you your good at drawing... i suck at drawing
/me giggles
Ahh
I suck at drawing too
Heheh

I came in to a rather fruity conversation, didn't I? :S
Shizuka: you got some sass, me likes :D

Lol
Polydunami: Nope, videogaming league :D
Goo1 Square
13Scoot-Scootaloo: so, unable to compete with professionals, you just squirt water at them?
13pretty weak
00,03I was talking about grapes..
Pff :D
O.o
00,03And Shizuka, NO! It's just that my skills... drench the pro's.... something...
so Scoot-Scootaloo throws grapes at the pros because he is jealous
00,03Umm...
/me shuts up :x
13face it scoot
XD
13we hold the leverage over you
Why cant we just get along and watch a stream? :O We gotta shaaaaare, we gotta caaaaaare.
:D
13also
Klumzeedragon: this is just playful teasing :D
13today the human race takes a giant leap forward
:O how so?

Klumzeedragon: :P
Not sure if I want to believe this or not...
/me hugs Scoot-Scootaloo

00,10I see that flag of the royal pony sisters
13i think it's swahili
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Drawfriend Stuff #549

00,10my eqd seems to be posting alot
thanks eqs
00,10wonder if they are trying to burry somthing
eqd*
13they're trying to bury the failpost
Sumica: must make up for their epic mistake! :D
yay thanks eqd!
http://tinyurl.com/9cpdjzp Thanks to the EQD-bot :3
is it just me, or do the mods here hate eqd
00,10seem to be removing alot of post too
00,03"Nothing to see here, enjoy ponies!"
00,10oh you hate eqd twilight_sprinkle?
They have a pony mod for civ 5 too I think
Sumica: ofc not, i think its great.
00,10well you said is it just you?
Cereal's face when someone told him that twitter username was HubTVNetvvork
I can imagine.
Hah
"is it just me" can be taken another way :P
Good evening
00,03Oh not at all! where else will we get such high quality and totally honest brony news?
there's one image posted twice in that list
Hey there Golakka
Good evening Golakka
Scoot-Scootaloo: theyre not honest? O.o
Kill them they arent ponies or bronies
Not sure if sarcastic :S
yay! hex strategy!
Polydunami: same
00,03I talk too much >_<
so this means equestria isn't a reskinned byzantium
dat kaiser :3
Scoot-Scootaloo: youve said too much! you must hit yourself with a lamp now!
is GilDash alive? cos if he is, hes a mop
no horse-based special unit and horse-using special building
00,10twilight_sprinkle, they are very bias.
xD
Golakka: I see you come in and I wasn't disappointed. :D
Sumica: biased how, its not like they post any opinions
:d
not any major ones at least
Oh my
00,10no they are bias in what they post
not even just biased
lyra!!
13twilight_sprinkle: you must not have been here after the season ended
http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.aspx?Item=302205845#PIC
Aqquire!
Shizuka: 1st no, 2nd yes
Well done Wrek!
what we watching
Sumica: you mean they only post what works by particular people?
so, who is playing?
00,10partly yes.
I vote for naval supremacy http://fav.me/d5d1j18
This is Caramel playing, Golakka
00,03Golakka: what is that? some kind of "real" Gun?
00,03ah
Shizuka: I actually wasn't, what happened?
Its a clockwork rail mag assault rifle
with caseless ammunition
Powered by witchcraft and Gypsy magic
00,03So... extended mags?
i love derpy
canterlot is unprotected
you just know that's going to be a plot point
13despite the fact that we streamed much more than simple marathons of episodes, EQD started lumping us in with other streams that do nothing but pony
no, it has a similar magazine system to the FN-P90
13and as soon as the season ended, our newsletters stopped getting posted at all
lol thought as much
However it fires caseless ammunition
knew it had to do with here...
13heaven forbid one of the largest pony streaming sites actually gets exposure
I say build endless hords of horsemen
you should've given seth more dragon dildos
if not the largest Shizuka
Lawl Buytoast
XD
Or a Trixie 'hand puppet'. :P
Seth... Dragons... oh God, the memories come flooding back
or both
Yes dari... "hand" puppet
in the same box
and send him a Trixie version of the Lyra plush
00,03I was gonna suggest a Cynder R34 picture...
with a note
Trixie hand puppet with a dragon dildo :D
"you know what to do"
Oh dear
Let's not go to TLoS
13twilight_sprinkle: and we won't get into the part where seth was helping draw plans to build a site to knock us off the internet
So where do politics fit in with the brony fanbase? :S
poly: not
Polydunami: EQD is ALL politics.
Yeah, it's not a nation :P
The only real politics in the fanbase is 4chan VS ponychan tbh
Brony+politic=no good
not really
4chan vs pony is simple
ponyfags keep starting shit
people hate them for it
I vote Shizuka as the pony president.
its simple
Shizuka: Shizuka: well i dont think its very right to hate them because they didnt give us a special post, and after the season-end they probably stopped posting because we no new pony eps. as for the knocking off thing, did he literally tell you it was directed to knock this site off? cause there are plenty of sites similar to this one, just not as good, maybe he jsut wanted to make one too
00,10I cant wait till we can start placeing bets as to how late eqd will post movie night again once pony eps start.
we kill the Batman
dat double shizuka
Polydunami there are those how who argue whos best pony
05hey Golakka
Not as good as pirate rairty
Anyways, gonna go kill things. :3
What's this? Civilization?
13twilight_sprinkle: thankfully it fizzled, but it was a severe leak of ideas we'd been building here, and seth was too incompetent to put them into action before we did
nothing can match it :D
Wrek: You know you've been featured on EQD, right?
O.o
Shizuka: leak how? i mean like i said, maybe he didnt want to harm this place, just make his own
Again, AJIsAwesome? :3
but he's too much of a cockgobbling prat to want to leave his ivory tower and start some video site
13like i said i won't go into it, but suffice to say there was no pretense of friendly competition in what details we heard about him
I remember when Ghosties was here giving his rant about the whole brony fanbase and what it has become to him.
indeed
i must have missed that
13thankfully seth is too incompetent to approach the level of quality we here are capable of
was it scathing?
and I agree with him on it
/me doesn't know what everyone is going on about
Mainly because I kind of provoked the rant :$
Monkeys
Shizuka, I just scrolled up and saw you announcing the end of a travesty.
??
Buytoast: Well, Ghosties calls himself an 'anti-brony'
MLP_Brovakiin: Join the club.
Shizuka: "heard" i wouldnt hate someone over rumors too much, couldve just been some misunderstanding.. i know im not going to hate him over rumors at least
Shizuka, I agree with your gif
understandable
Frog's theme, huh?
00,10twilight_sprinkle, there is far more to it then that
indeed, twilight_sprinkle
00,10and heard of it is recived chat logs
Shall we drop the EQD talk?
00,10probably a good idea dari
Thought I heard Chrono trigger for a second...brb finding my ds

Celes_Chere: Newborn cuties? hell yeah! Not the best, but i can dig it
Lauren FRaust is behind it and it's amazing
the only problem they did was the voice
Hey guys, did you hear? We're getting a season 3!

Mine was actually four :$
i have this song on my phone. its beautiful <3
cachi01|phone, I won't
SpadeMagnes[R]: I wouldn't have minded it if they put more effort into it.
Only thing that made me tollerate it was playing Live and Learn as the music track
cachi01|phone: FF7 was my first FF. Feel free to kick *me* as hard as you can. :D
Hey quick ques what is the drunk pony?
Berry Punch, I think
instead I'll suggest you to please play the others
cachi01|phone: I have never played FF :P
especially the SNES ones
Again Time Eater should have had parts from several sonic final bosses
GilDash: you think thats bad, i've never played FF at ALL
My first FF was FFVIII, then FFIX, FFVI, FFX, FFXII, FFVII
MUFFINS!
:D
SpadeMagnes[R]: True.
Random question: What is an estimate for the brony population?
pfft FFVI is the best ff
:kickbot slenderman
I've played one of the other 2d FF's, but I don't remember much about it, nor which one
cachi01|phone: This command requires at least 2 parameters.
Pink3: and then i said 'oatmeal? are you serious?!'

Oh sup Poly, haven't seen you around in a day or two, iirc
who is streaming anyway?
Not to be rude but this type of gameplay looks boring to me
I'll still watch
Flyboy: Crml
kk
SpadeMagnes[R]: RTS games aren't for everyone, and Civ moves pretty slowly for an RTS.
GANGNAM STYLE
I love em though
RTS are also kinda boring for me
There is one thing I am dreading for Mists of Pandaria
Caramel: so what you going for? nuclear superiority? peace? economic victory?

00,10not sure if seapony lyra is part of the program yet
SpadeMagnes[R] ping -______-
00,10she was still a add on when I got her
Panda: What
Panda: Your name is Panda

Sent
Panda: I was gonna follow that up, smart aleck :P
Insert you dont say gif here

13SpadeMagnes[R]: wow has lore? i thought it was 100% "go here kill X of Y and come back"

00,10ff8 opening
Panda: panda, panda, panda... panda
Shizuka: <.<
shizu: you'd be incredibly surprised
Shizuka lol
and no sumica, that's 8...again
Shizuka that is correct.... >.>
There is alot of lore to read
remeber this song from that melee machinima video
Flyboy xD
yay for italy!
13i'm sure, but wow was an unbearable grindfest after just three days on the trial, that's when i gave up on it
00,10read what I said again Caramel
I never found it unberable
idontgetit.jpg
Shizuka: *whispers*:private servers with 20x exp rates
theres like no grind left in wow... unless you see raw questing as grinding
Wow has lore! :'( Well, Warcraft did :D
00,10I said it was ff 8
* private
00,10you said no it's 8
13walk here, kill ten monsters, walk back, okay now walk a liiitle further and kill twenty monsters and come back, now here take this item to this guy four feet away
I got so bored one month that I grinded from 60 to 80 in less than a month
you said 3...
Shizuka again, correct.
He said 8 Caramel.
xD
^
what's even more surprising, team fortress 2 has lore
earlifting. how to buff up when you have some headphones
^
Shizuka: When did you first play??
ah, that's why
1307 ish
screencap has the red border right down it
13somewhere between 07 and 08
so it looks like a 3
13ten day trial, i stopped on day 3
00,10that cracked me up about wow
When Cata came out I did the stupidest thing
Shizuka: You have to do quests to get the Lore part :D
00,10free 10day trial, or you could buy a 14 day for 2.99
13even DDO stayed interesting for at least a week, atlantica held me for a month before getting dull
I flew into Orgrimar and did the low level dungeon
they fixed the entire old world now... questing is so insanely fast its almost not funny
dat smile
Caramel: what are your cities called then? you better have named one manechester...
awwww...
you could get to max level on those 3 days no problem
yay!
dis song works
I doubt it
it's a pony mod
I'm playing as the Equestrian empire
inb4 Everyone sings along.
xD
I never got the Damn tiger mount from ZG before they got rid of it! :'(
Princess Luna as my leader
hey sumica 1 question: did you ever finish that game of Massiv effect game or whaever that game is called yyet?
Caramel: oh! i wondered why the equestrian flag was there
I'll show you in the civilopedia
Stupid Cata!!
I got the raven mount

hmmm ok
You know that raven boss in burning crusade?

SpadeMagnes[R]: Oh! Raven lord :P

I love that mount :)

MAKE NUKES
Find a way!
13i played china once in civ3 and was nuking greece in 1800, when the best unit they had was the swordsman
hey guys , is this an equestia civ?
11,01Ye old nuclear war.
Lol
13and that was before i moved up to civ4 and learned about debug mode
well that sounds satisfying
I assume the Giant Fel Reaver was a nightmare in the burning crusade days
No wonder Greece is in such bad recession.
lol
You're minding your own buisness and suddenly you get stomped
one thing i dont understand about the equestrian empire. how come on the heartswarming eve episode. its way before celestia and lunas rule, yet the flag still shows them on it. PLOTHOLES GALORE
Gandhi + nukes = classic
Come and smiiiiiile~
SMILE
lol Scootaloo
I still love my bitching Motorcycle mount

eeeeewwww...
Flyboy: propaganda

WindWhistler: Hello!
Hi WindWhistler
Today I got an iPad issued by my school
Hi WindWhistler
WindWhistler: the hell?
hai WindWhistler
Oh hey WindWhistler
Sumica: Just shows we know how to build our shit.
xd
hi windo
:D*
Depending on the class you're in, you may get an iPad
WindWhistler why did they give you an iPad?
ejection!
Dken2021: I was in a "strategies for learning" class. They're giving all the juniors iPads to see if they perform better in school.
Based on previous years, they seem to work well
they're gonna be able to communicate in 3... 2... 1...
heh wow wishi could go to that school and get a ipad
First thing I did with my iPad was look for some art apps
WindWhistler: My school is to poor for Ipads :P
omg
Found some. But I don't have a stylus specifically for iPads...
*your 3... 2... 1... may vary
you find any WindWhistler
I don't want to use my finger either.
dis gonna be good
my high school was gonna do some sort of progrram that involved iPads, but they did it after I graduated
Dken2021: Sucks for you.
That's just like how they added a Japanese class in my middle school when I got into 7th grade
I had already chosen my language class by then.
I know, and then they had better clubs after I graduated too
Anyways, until I get a stylus for the iPad, I'm just gonna use it for drawing when I'm at school and not at home.
or die!
even a taxidermy club
I see they ripped off Star Wars.
Dken2021: Chuck Testa?
what is this?
Farscape
WindWhistler uh, yea
Dken2021: You don't get it, do you.
This looks stupid
NOPE
Dken2021: Shame.
what did i come back to?
Look Chuck Testa up when you get the chance, Dken2021
Well anyways, I gotta organize my iPod.
Dken2021: I see what you did there
and what are the movies tomarrow?
... Never mind :P

well someone got it

Take 2 Shizuka. Just incase someone else fell for it but hasnt said anything.
11,01Maybe they'll sell at a loss at $20.
Shizuka, are you sure you can make it? Whitout dying of alcohol poisoning?
11,01Sorry, $10.

This is such a cheesy show
T-Sparx: bi. Pinkie: gay. Rainbowdash: gay. AJ: I have no idea. Fluttershy: Gay. Rarity: Straight. And with those thoughts, I bid y'all adieu for now :)

Hey youg guys. Who is Vinyl Scratch? I remember seeing her like once, and she never talked. So why is there so much fandom or whatever of her? People act like she's a main character.
Polydunami: That's The Joke.gif

WTH SUMICA
I SAID AFTER TAHT I WOULD STOP
Wow, my comp lagged like crazy there.
AJIsAwesome: So, lemme guess... The Buffer Show season 4....?

Polydunami: Maybe that's why she need a hero... a hero who knows music
BileGraze: SHe was a disk jockey in one of the episodes. If you want to know why, you might want to do some research.
I'll be right back
Yes Phoenix.
<_< >_>
AJIsAwesome: EDI: "That was a joke." Joker: "She's trying, Commander."
It does't make sense.
Same with Derpy. How is retardation lovable?
BileGraze: Use Know Your Meme for a start.

BileGraze: Derpy ain't retarded!

SMOOCH
kisses rarity then laughs
And Octavia. Can't forget Octavia
):
:(
Dr. Whooves?
BileGraze: And it's because even minor characters need love.
BileGraze: And Vinyl Scratch is a.k.a. DJ P0N-3
BileGraze: Partially because the fandom attaches personalities to them and makes them our own.
Ah, speaking of which.
docta 9?

Yep, Ninth Doctor
Wow, um.

I know Sumica.
BileGraze: Sometimes an episodic character in the series gets popular. E.g. Scruffy from Futurama.
Oohhweee wooooo
evening everypony
BileGraze: It just happens
This show is pretty fast paced; I'm going through the first doctor's tenure and it's pretty slow-moving :3
*yay*
CountDoofus: Which one?
DAH TELLY
NocturnalBlade: Hello!
GREATEST DAY EVER!! I'M FREAKIN ON THIS ONE!!!
hai NocturnalBlade
Yay!
:'(
Yay!
Polydunami|DoctorWho: it has some slow bits
PillowPoni|Cooking: Dunno. 9th Doctor, apparently.
It's not ALL bad :P
Sorry bout the caps...
BileGraze: It's personal preference. And people hapen to like the character design? Just get over it and don't let it bother you. It would get BORING if everypony just swooned over the mane six and all the fan stuff was just about them, no?
Besides, it's thought-provoking
No. She dead.
^^
BileGraze: they are liked because they arent really minor characters anymore. for the community the difference between derpy and say fluttershy isnt that big. so you have fans off all of them
lol
I suppose so Klumzeedragon.
11,01500 lbs or 500,000 lbs?
Okay Fou_Lou.
Derpy is like that clumsy little sister that when she inevitabley messes something up you shake your head and chuckle.

AJIsAwesome: Doing it right.
I'm wearing a queen shirt...British enough.
SirGanjalf: And I will!
SirGanjalf: If only you could watch the series from the beginning

The doctors get progressively younger. :D
How was the 4th one popular again? I know how the 10th one is.
AJIsAwesome: 4th was popular among the older fans

Agrold: Someone asked me recently, and I gave this brief account
Polydunami|DoctorWho: hehe:P
IOscar, what are you doing in there? Aren't you supposed to be in Sesame Street?
"Terrible acting, poor humour, fuck ugly, his Doctor can't be taken seriously, some of his stories are bullshit and I hate them (not his fault, but they're still 11th Doctor eps)."
*oscar*
Snake? SNAKE? SNAAAKE!

The sun is HAWT

I wonder how many years this planet has left
/me hugs Eulshy "better?"
Nittany_Discord: except youll move the earth further away
OohShiny no old, 9th doctor
XylemTube: This is a good one. Second episode of the new series.
OohShiny: not really, this is the 9th Doctor.
Nittany_Discord: True. It won't be so blue at that time
I'm just starting to get into Doctor Who and I'm already on the right track :P
NocturnalBlade. A little
Nittany_Discord: logic, how does it work
"Use of religion"
Only about five billion, SpadeMagnes[R] :P
SpadeMagnes[R]: Well, when Mary appeared in 1917, she did say if russia ended the war, 1000 years of peace for us.
/me more hugging on Eulshy
Also, we humans will probably be long gone anyway.
The 9th had the second shortest run of all the Doctors
Polydunami: They just said humans are still around.
NocturnalBlade, fanks you
Me and my catholic beliefs...
Polydunami: Weren't you listening to the Doctor? What if we survive? ;)
Eulshy: no prob ^_^
Obsidian wasn;t it like 12 episodes he appeared?
And yes, Nine had one season. Then he was replaced by Tennant, and we all went YES.

I'm from 5.5 billion years ago and just now realizing this may not have been the smartest movie I've ever made.
Sumica: Shhhhhh!
Ded?
oh snap
OH nOOOOOOOOOOOO
I dunno, I still like Ian and Barbara as companions
dat 2005 CG
Aw hell
Reikim: I got very tired of her. Donna is my fave NuWho companion.
aka the very first companions
Sumica
ded?
very ditzy eh?
Whoops, forgot
I'm very much a Leela fan.
"Are you still there?"

Okay, I'm prepared.
aww, theyu got cute disco lights

NOT THE PLUMERRRRR!
MARIO NO
Beep boop, son
sumica i have 5 :)
haha
lol
I want the Doc to just have a male companion for once.
By the way, anyone new to Who: get used to seeing a lot of expendable characters.
4 tiny little bots are able to carry a woman? Makes sense to me.
Doc gets all the ladies
Next Doctor should be a woman
DocSane: Roary. Also he had plenty in Classic Who.
Would be interesting
The R2D2 of Doctor Who.
lol prince
lol
What place does Micky serve
AJIsAwesome: that a Future bots. Thats enough sense
Reikim: I want Rory to stay and Amy to please go away.

Holy crap. Only just now did I discover "Torchwood" is an anagram of "Doctor Who".

DocSane: Didn't they both get shoved off? I distinctly remember this.
"I'm different!"
Lol
Reikim: Not permanently.
They are part Stormtrooper
Reikim: But the Doc gets a new companion next series.
CountDoofus I know, weird
So Rose is the romantic companion?
ya don't say
I'm the alien.

CountDoofus: A bit slow, thar.
....what's that supposed to mean doctor?

"Your machine gets inside my head"

ah, I kid
Wait, so she dumped her boyfriend for a time lord she doesn't even know? Why? Was her boyfriend a jerk?
00,10he was a slag
AJIsAwesome: He wasn't a time-travelling alien with a nice jacket.
this is me and you are you and we are .. together
Sensitive topic!
AJIsAwesome: Rose is impulsive and knows adventure when she sees it.
AJIsAwesome: its a time machine. she can get back right the moment she left
Reikim: I dunno! All I've seen of Doctor Who was on this stream, and only ever seen 1 Torchwood episode. I never noticed it :<
Ok. Thanks.
This is why I love the Eccleston doctor the best. He gets angry. He's kind of a jerk and a bit condescending. Like a super-intelligent alien should be. :)
dat tech
"Jiggedy Pokery"
00,10it's like timeie whimie
You get cell reception in space?
Jiggery pokery is such an advanced term, right up there with "wibbly wobbly timey wimey"
now that's wicked
I still like Tennant best because he's crazy and has a really nice jacket.
Like, really nice.
making a call backwards in time?
lol Reikim
cool
SpadeMagnes[R]: It's a time/space phone. She can call home to her own time.
This is my 4th episode to watch. I have no idea what is going on.
Question: how does the phone decide WHEN to call?
flutter_spin: It's the very start of the series.
I am certainly NOT traveling through time and space
WAAAAAAAAAAy dead
very start of the.. should it be in black and white?
Reikim when i tell it tl
To
Reikim: Timey Whimy Wibbley Wabblely
Reikim complex stuff
Reikim: It's kind of locked to Rose's home time
SpadeMagnes[R]: you are. right now
I wonder how much phone companies that allow calls to different times charge
DocSane: But WHEN along that timeline?
It's the second of the current series, flutter_spin
"Blink" is the best Who episode evah.
Oh no, Not the time travel logic again! My brain's going to hurt....:S
flutter_spin: The Doctor is an alien who travels around time and space in a police box that is bigger on the inside and has adventures and saves the Universe multiple times. And stuff.
Reikim: It's locked to Rose's relative time line.
Can we watch Blink next?
I liked the Girl in the Fireplace best
Hey boys it's a spy!
DocSane: Ah, I see. Makes sense, though it's hard to explain...
So time passes relatively at the same rate for her and her home time
Spider sappin' mah space station! :O
His mug is adorable. Sorry.
Yeah. I kind of got all that Reikim. It is just I didn't know what part of the season it is.
magmablock: We've seen that like 20 times on this stream
So if she waits a day and calls home, it knows to call her mum a day later.
ctrl alt delete
00,10why would you even have that
flutter_spin: This is the second episode of the first season.
i want a Little Robotic Spider :(
Aaaaaaand ded.
Why the fuck is that even instaled?
11,01Duck.
Sumica: Because idiots.
geez, with a simple push of a button
Why would there be a single button that would KILL YOU?
Oops spilt my drink, sun filter down!
Obsidian: nevermind then
Why did he let it do that?:S
Nittany_Discord: You, of all people, should now that ducking wouldn't help.
Sumica: better question why wouldnt he know how to reverse it
really? what year? this looks really recent.
And why didnt he hit the same button?
"Sentry mode: activated"

Such hard what?:S
flutter_spin: The Time Lords instituted a Time Lock: the entire segment of the universal timeline containing the Time War is locked. Nobody can travel in or out. The Doctor is the only one to have escaped, due to deserting at some unknown point in the War.

This music is supposed to be fitting?:S
It's a 'classic' XylemTube
flutter_spin: Hilariously, it's basically the only event in the Doctor's life that never gets expanded upon.
oh shit
00,10better idea, dont be in path of window
And then Rose died. The End.
At least she can get vitamin D
unless you got SPF 11tibillion, better get out

Shizuka: I'll join up to help you there. I can sympathize...
I read that. Sonic Screwdriver is a tool. It can't really do stuff on its own... really
Poor Earth :'(
And then a meteor smashed through the window
thats what the tardis is for

They didn't
13ponies
ah that one
Pyroid: You could see them in her.
They just left and interbred
00,10oh boo hoo rose
Discord, they didnt, they bred into the other aliens
Now, an older Doctor would have spared her. Ninth takes a different view, presumably due to the Time War experiences.
Discord: I'm going with grey goo
00,10hee lets go back in time a day
I was just thinking that Sumica
Discord: Judging on her - to much plastic operations
Earl GRAY!
do we go to vinylscratch for movie suggestions?
seriously, time travel is messed up
and confusing
dat stock baby cry :S
now that she knows how the worlds end
*is*
superretroworld: Nope, no requests right now. You'll see it's muted.
AJIsAwesome: Probably
The point of this episode is to explain the Doctor's point of view.
I will repeat as I always do in this show
Polydunami|DW I bet the baby that made that cry is an adult.
Aliens traveling around in time
AJIsAwesome Indeed.
And you're bothered about blood vessels?
Maybe even... ded.
=o
You are listening to ded babies.
You mean an adult NOW, Barbetos?
He's seen the death of worlds, including his own.
^^
Reikim: oh, but where do you go next time?
Ooh, blood vessels are the most improbable part of this TV show
How is this guy not insane by now?
EXPLAIN
:P
00,10"just repeat to your self it's just a show and i realy should just relax"
He can watch races die and then see them alive again.
He can go back and prevent the war from happening.
Polydunami|DW I said exactly what I meant.
He exists in a universe of ghosts.
AJIsAwesome: The war is time locked
superretroworld: For what, BMN? You have to sign up for the newsletter and fill out the survey.
A baby adult is crying.
SpadeMagnes[R: Ok.
AJIsAwesome: No, he can't.
No one can enter the time of it or leave it
k
AJIsAwesome: Timelock prevents him
AJIsAwesome: You should read up on that Time War. There is ALOT of paradoxes and stuff there
I know now.
AJIsAwesome: He can't do anythign to change his own past.
AJIsAwesome: And knowing is half the battle!
So with all the things the Doctor has seen, how has he not gone insane?
Basically, the Time War was one long string of paradoxes. It almost ripped apart the universe.
Aliens
AJIsAwesome: Time travel rules seem to be very much dependent on what you know about your own past.
SpadeMagnes[R: he is kinda insane already
SpadeMagnes[R: You're saying he hasn't :P
SpadeMagnes[R: Alienssss
So she dumped her boyfriend?
Ah

she's looks lively to me

Shizuka: if you shall take me.. then alright! :P
The credits got it wrong; his name isn't "Doctor Who", it's just the Doctor
Shizuka: I'm up for it but I need some time

thats a eardrums blowing death trap
It was Doctor Who in the very beginning, then becmae The Doctor in the 1970s.
Just a question, but if a Mann Up ticket cost real money and you can only use the cash you receive in the that one game only, What's the pont of playing the Mann up mode?
Im wearing headphones... ()__()

I still dont see the point of a rock farm
Those rocks don't push themselves
pony logic
SpadeMagnes[R: It's a cartoon.:D
You cant cultivate rocks like crops
00,10rock farm is just another way of saying a mine
A mine would be more apt
pinky pie can duh^^
SpadeMagnes[R: But you can "age" rubies.
my headcannon: it used to be a regular farm, but then the parapsrites showed up and ate everything, then they switched to rocks
Think of this. Maybe they collected the rocks because they had gems inside, only they had to give them to the unicorns to break open
"TF2 is not responding" Story of my life =_(\
00,10like callinga super market a food libary
There we go
They moved the rocks around to foster gem
DIOOOOOOOOOOOO

They moved the rocks around to foster gem growth.

Malk: Okie.
I'm back had to restart my computer
TheMasterPhoenix: Yeah I will
WUT? They thought he ... I mean.. .ugh.. this is the whole ice cream debate all over again
SpadeMagnes[R: She was getting stoned
SpadeMagnes[R: I think they explained that in the episode.
I dont know why but I would like to see a episode centered on Zebra culture
SpadeMagnes[R, that would be neat for world building
Ponies47 equestia girls
Yeah. Twilight told Fluttershy she was going in there. I forgot what. I didn't really like that episode too much (compared to the others)
SpadeMagnes[R: I like that idea.
Malk: What about it? :p
noooooooo
I still find it a bit sad the student of Celestia lost to a chicken snake
TheMasterPhoenix: Dude, that's amazing
dat koth_harvest
robotdragon9, I saw a wallpaper with that
Ponies47 nothing I just feel like I should just call you out at random times from now on

SpadeMagnes[R: Plus, it can turn things to stone almost instantly.
i didnt draw it though in case ur wunderin

Ponies47 Idk its slightly entertaining
How cute!
Well I'm sure twilight could have teleported or blasted it or something
Can't wait for next Halloween mob.

Greatest wtf moment ever
Thanks, Sumica!:)
Shizuka: Game still open or full?
Why do they need to do a musical number instead of just helping them?
Thanks for the stream Sumica
00,10yep my time is up
I would have laughed so hard if the bubble popped...
i hate sea ponies but i like this song
Applejack looks so utterly confused...like the audience
Thanks so much Sumi ^o^

Oh and thanks for Stream Sumica

WHAT
Sumica: is sea ponies your closing theme?
It's Bacon and Applejack!
I just joined
We almost died!
Hai thar pony_8565.

They could've save Megan and Applejack some time if they didn't sing.
*saved*
pony_8565 i joined in december or something
I love dat picture of the CMC

Some people hate the CMC. I can't figure that out.
I LOVE the CMC <3
I wonder what would be more worth getting the WiiU or a replacement 3DS XL to replace my 3DS
Is anypony else getting the Buffer Show?
oh....derp
one episode i wished they change is hearts and hooves day, they should of just made a simple love story
i am
yeah
eeyup
pony_8565: Y U NO HAVE NICKNAME?
aww man, I'm missing the buffer show?
^^
/me Looks at the screen "Oh the buffer show! I LOVE THIS SHOW!"
i do its lbelmore8
come to think of it....i dont want ANY shipping to become canon, even the ones i ship...
ssssssswwwwwwwwwwwaaaaaagggggggggggg

i was to lazy to sign in
robotdragon9, that's smart
pony_8565: I see.
tell me when that part of the show ends. i hate that part
thanks
pretty sure the only canon shipping is only gonna be the cakes and cadence and shining armor
thelonepony: Which part? the part when the circle is on top? or on the bottom?
whats the original mlp called?
so what does bronystate says on this http://dailycurrant.com/2012/08/30/bill-nye-blasts-todd-akin-challenges-debate/
With all the shit that happens to ponyville how has it not been destroyed?
i'm gonna sign in now
on the bottom Flootashy
i kinda wish more people would ship cadence and armor with someone else..... to break the monotony
SpadeMagnes[R: Magic. *snort**snort*
robotdragon9 oh well kids show, wattr'ya gonna do?
Someday, they'll give a main character a canon boyfriend, and so many fans will be sad.
Ok im off to night then. Whish you all a good night. See ya tomorro to movie night.
heh yeah
DocSane, more like mad
Fou_Lou: Night!
why sad?
night Fou_Lou
bai Fou_Lou
im really happy right now guys
Moopy: Why?
They're running out of relationships to explore.
TheMasterPhoenix becasue it will conficlt with their headcanon
i found gold in minecraft on the xbox
To this day I still think Snips and Snails should have been thrown in jail or something for bringing a Ursa Minor into town
Dken2021, that's mad
TBH, I'd like them to do a story about parents.
Anyone try out that new "Where Am I?" game?
SpadeMagnes[R: More juvie than jail, IMO.
flutter_spin: No, where can i play it?
sad for me is like your waifu is now taken so you won't ever beable to be with her
Snips and Snails are little kids. They're not criminally liable, just stupid.
not that you couldn't from the start anyway
also since stream is oah
I still have to say, Snips and Snails should've been punished.:D
ovah**
shit shit shit shit i sleept in shit
They brought in a giant monster THAT ALMOST DESTROYED THE TOWN because they thought trixie could beat it!
Then their parents are liable.
i missed school dam it

bai pyrocatboy
i dont wanna play a game by parsec.... last time i shit my pants
mods are asleep post links
FYI: The game was done in 48 hours. It was just a fun little project
Damnit Sumi. Now I'm listening to Scootaloo going beep on repeat, and it doesn't blend well with playing GW2. :|
(not mine)
136 people, about as active as a mime
CK http://youtu.be/EBgGgzvJGyM
this might
maybe
SpadeMagnes[R: AYO
haven't played GW2
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Mxfsq8A9wc I'm not fan of this song but I'll accpect this version :P

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk3y4Nc1i5I i just thought id give this song a mention (unrelated)
CrimsonPhoenix: Too late. Once I start listening to something on repeat, I'm doomed for the next few hours, minimum.
CK|GW2, just give it a chance
What is on Friday movie night
Over the Hedge
i kinda liked that movie
aND?
No, I mean, once I start listening to something on repeat, I literally cannot stop listening to it. Strange compulsive habit of mine. XD
My favourite movie
If Season 3 doesnt have Tank or Peewee in it I will be sad
SpadeMagnes[R: yea
CK|GW2, Party pooper
I mean whats the point of giving Dash a pet and never bring it up again
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-7rVdXXwds
I don't think tank wasn;pt cute enough for the audience
I thought he was cute...
i liked him....
SpadeMagnes[R: What's the point of bringing it up again? He did his thing. If they need him again they'll show him :)
Well the point is why give her a pet and never mention him again
I wonder how many people are playing the "Where Am I?" game
What was the point of Owlicious?
Have you guys seen the comments in the IGN video? So much butthurt.
AJIsAwesome: video?
well i shit my pants playing slender so i wont play it
Petrified_Discord: EQD.
DocSane: Yeah, I didn't care for the owl either. Meant to be another Spike, without replacing him
AJIsAwesome, that Metal Gear video?
Well, it was meant to explore dealing with jealousy.
I dont like it when shows create characters soley for a plot and then they get forgotton
Except that Green Isn't Your Color did it better
Kind of "hey we need to do something for the lesson here" which I think hurt the episode
SpadeMagnes[R: Well that's what the later seasons are for.
Whenever its an event-centric or character-development episode, it rules
Whenever it is some weird lesson, it suffers
One of the worst lessons was in MMMontFE
Maybe they'll expand their character. Maybe they won't. In the end, we shouldn't really complain about it.
http://youtu.be/pJ_jdruQca0
before EQD features it and remix gets done
I hated how Pinkie Pie somehow had to be the lesson object of "Don't make baseless accuations"
DocSane, why?
Meanwhile, a bunch of main characters ruined the Cakes' cake without any reprecussions
i just finished watching the predator trilogy...
Yea that was kind of a dick move on their part
They ruin the cake, no punishment what so ever
AJ and Twilight were the only main characters who did nothing wrong, and in the end they didn't get to eat any of the cake.
The cake episode had enough thrills and gags to keep it going, but I didn't care about the episode overall. Still better than half of the other ones
Aj was supposed to be a culprate
it got cut though
somepony should make a supercut of losing on slender. that would be funny
IJ is too much of an ikemen to eat the cake
So Twi did nothing wrong and got punished for it.
Yeah. They mentioned they had to cut AJ being a part of the whole thing, due to time
So Aj would have done it anyway
We can assume AJ eat the cake when Pinkie was asleep
Kind of like the extended backstory of Derpy. They had to cut that out too.
However, element of Honesty and whathave you, it fits her character to not eat the cake.
yet a character can be imperfect.
I know its for plot, but what kind of friends ruin another friend's important thing
Rex_Mundi, don't put the elements in the arguments
Which makes an interesting episode :)
Friendship Express had funny gags, but was kind of a terrible episode in execution
elements are cores for drastic measures
i didnt care for that episode
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Budding Friendships OST Released
ohay SaxyPretender
Better than Owls well that ends well
i watched it live here
they are irrelevent for something as small as a petty contestant
I liked Owl's Well more than Friendship Express
ugh. Let me consult my episode fav list
I know characters should have flaws but the mane 6 can be real jerks to eachother sometimes
DocSane: that was a great episode, spikes stories are always great
"Owl's Well That Ends Well" is 3rd worst episode on my list
I have a question
0,14oh hai
SpadeMagnes[R, that's what makes the show good
do you want FiM to be like G3?
True friends are jerks to each other and they dont give a shit instead they just laugh
i want to put a list of movies i like and everyone hates but im too intimidated to do it...
ello there SaxyPretender
Hey SaxyPretender
Where EVERYTHING IS HAPPY AND COLORFUL AND EVERYONE IS HAPPY AND KIND
Hi saxy :
<.<
SaxyPretender: hello parking meter
13SuperBrony64: you're up
robotdragon9: give me a movie
Oh hey, a Saxy.
<><
predator 2
CrimsonPhoenix: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fjot9jkpmv0
"Over a Barrel" was my 2nd worst episode
Dang I missed the sea ponies...
so...how about that lady rainicorn baby?
robotdragon9: never seen it
flutter_spin: agreed, im guessing mare do well ep is the worst
Rex_Mundi, OSHIT BEST SHOW EVER I have to watch this
heh.
SpadeMagnes[R: Same way an alicorn grows up
robotdragon9: really, what about the first one?
SpadeMagnes they grow they die they reborn the grow they die
i like the first one but everyone around me seems to hate the 2nd superretroworld
Isnt Cadence like a winged unicorn or something?
cachi01|phone, though I admit many media picture them reborn as adults
A different breed of alicorn?
oh
worst episode....ummm...My least favorite would be owl
my least favorite is owl's well ends well.
We still dont know if tia and luna are inmortal
I think alicorns are just automatically proclaimed "princess ponies"\
is anything playing for anyone?
why does everyone hate the owl episode?
SpadeMagnes[R: The show never calls them "alicorns". It calls them "winged unicorns". Alicorn is only used by fans, even though it's accurate.
Yeah, like there are "normal" Alicorns like cadance, and then there are Celestia and Luna...
Idj
so apparently microwaving a small potato without the skin ignites it
i also liked kingdom of the crystal skull *hides*
is anything playing?
My 4th worst episode: "Swarm of the Century" I don't know. I hated how every pony ignored Pinkie Pie. I just kept shouting at the screen, "SHE KNOWS!!!!"
So who here was tricked when EqD that fake Hub tweet on Season 3's air date, or did no one fall for it?
robotdragon9: i liked that movie too, dont worry
How is it accurate? Alicorn is just a name for the material unicorn horns are supposedly made of.
Well Pinkie pie being pinkie pie... would you ever take her seriously?
superretroworld, oh ok thanks
Hey, she identified them. I would have listened.
SpadeMagnes[R: Pinkie is very rarely wrong, though
I thought that was real..I even texted my friends...
Besides, she isn't 2sided. Pinkie has her moments.
Kawaii_icybeauti: ...Me too :P
guys, is anything playing?
Boo
I would like to know how Pinkie knew about parasprites in the first place
Cool Trixie art http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m62utfQWpH1r7m1gto1_500.png
yo
totally SpadeMagnes[R - Thats what killed me.
neat
SpadeMagnes[R: She saw them at some point when she was growing up on the farm.
She KNEW something more than everyone else. I would have asked what else she knew
Rex_Mundi: redundant name is redundant :P
It bothers me that a simple earth pony knows what parasprites are but the goddess of the fuckign sun doesnt
Hi everypony <3
ello tSparx
EY tSparx
Hey tSparx
SpadeMagnes[R: Pinkie's weird *shrug*
the worst ep in my opinion is over a barrel
SpadeMagnes[R: Maybe Celestia is neither omnicient nor omnipotent
But most of my ratings are based on how much I personally liked the episode, if there wasn't some glaring flaw that bothered me the entire time
hey tSparx
I'll tell my friend it was a troll when I go back to school on tuesday.
superretroworld: its my 2nd worst
Over a Barrel is great just for its self-deconstruction of girl show tropes.
Well I highly doubt the parasprites never caused damage befor ethat episode
STREAm
/me thinks the worst episode was the Hearth´s Warming Eve one
I dont have a favourite episode
TF2!!!
Which one is Over a Barrel again?
I Spy MvM
the buffalos
whos streamin?
Ohai Shizuka stream
Whoes streaming?
tSparx: The one where they go to Appleloosa
T.F.2!!!!
I liked that one fine, wasn't my fav or anything but.
tSparx: When they go to applelosa.
tSparx: the ponies against the bulls
The vission has been doubled!
I have blood in my ear again 8)
i dont watch the amazing mare do well anymore cause of that supposed appledash kiss scene, it bothers me whenever its pointed out and i cant escape it.
Wait i mean i dont have a not liked episode
Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000 is down there on the list too. The episode was great, but I hated it. So many things bugged me in the episode.
robotdragon9: I really hated that joke. It seriously annoyed me.
>.<
ikr
I don't like every episode, and there are some I haven't even watched all of, but I don't think they're objectively bad.
robotdragon9: Doesnt bother me:D........ They diddnt kiss, but it looked like it did, thus the joke.
Why do my ears bleed so much?
I dont know
ditto tSparx .
SuperBrony64:
Over the barrel will be released on 2 weeks in mexico
I didnt really like the premise of the Mare do well episode
except the not watching every episode :P
Griffon the brush off is a good one, but I don't watch it too much because I can't honestly stand Gilda, especially when she made fluttershy cry.
engineers all like "haters gonna hate"
Especially my right ear. My right ear is the one that always gets infected and stuff
can't stand*
is it me or did they have a picture of asuka souryu back over there?
Kawaii_icybeauti: *shivers
Man this place sure is lively
If I ever NOT like an episode, I would lke the moral behind it. As long as the episode as a moral behind it, I'm fine with it.
Would I get a lot flak if I admitted that I don't like the CMC eps very much?
Think wee will ever see a male Alicorn? Just one please Hasbro, I want to know they exist. But not one like Celestia or Luna, more "normal" like Cadance.
cachi01|phone: in canada it hasent even been heard of
What other episodes....umm.....I guess that's all I have to complain about. I like all the rest.
LOL. tSparx I don't like CMC episodes either.
lbelmore8 really?
So far, I don't have an episode I DON'T like. I pretty much like all of them.
oh talking about episodes eh?
The CMC episodes aren't that good...
for some reason, i like to say that xenomorphs have a nest on a contienent far from equestria in my fanon.
They all act like idiots
I mean COME ON
lbelmore8 here in mexico we get 5 new episodes every 3 months or 4 :P
I also can't watch show stoppers because I'm watching them deny their talents...I can't stand it.
Shizuka: So what range is the Pyro good at? Ranged or up close?
WindWhistler: That's not why I don't like them -- they are little kids after all.
cachi01|phone: i'm dead serious i dont even think season 1 is done
WindWhistler: I love the CMC episodes.
The thing is, the CMC are embarrassing to watch. They just goof around doing crazy things.
children are naive sometimes
but hearts and hooves day is a personal favorite of mine.
robotdragon9: given the fact that ponyville iis near a gate to taurterus I wouldent put it past me
tSparx: I think even kids would realize some of these things...
AJIsAwesome: Close
lbelmore8 same here.
I bet they have ADHD or OCD or something
the only one i really liked was hearts and hooves day it was pretty funny
must explain why they're such idiots
ADD was created by companies to sell ritalin.
WindWhistler: Well, they're little kids in a show made for little kids, so they have to be dumb from a little kid's POV
*out of the CMC ones
Season 2 is going to premiere i think in 7 months here in mexico
WindWhistler: doesnt everybody have one of those?
cachi01|phone: canada has its ups and downs
How come I don't see a lot of people use demoman on the MvM matches?
You would think with all the shit the CMC they would have cause millions of damage or something
Aaaaand just realized stream @_@ Is it dear Shizu? :3
WindWhistler: Well, people with OCD and ADHD aren't any less intelligent than the rest of us.
*do
"Sisterhooves Social" has to be in the top 20 favorite episodes on my list
WindWhistler: My sister is a goddamn genius and she has ADHD
tSparx: Well of course I know that. I'm one of them. >.>
SpadeMagnes lol
hi guys
I have ADHD and OCD and Aspergers
finally got me a wired controller
EY otakon
So don't go yelling at me.
Hi otakon!
hey otakon
so NO MORE SUCKING SO MUCH AT TF2!
now brb
owl that ends well, the last roundup, and a friend in deed are my favourites
I loved the season 2 premire better than the first one...But there's something about the first one that makes it a treasure....Maybe it's because of it being my first pony episode.
otakon: What kind of controller is it, i need one also but i cant find one that compatable
WindWhistler: is that u Mitchell
RRRRRAAAAWWWEEEERRRRRR
Once people can clearly define what ADHD and ADD even is, then I might start declaring people to have it.
Lesson Zero I loved. Objectively, I think it's pretty bad, but watching T-Sparx go insane was AWESOME.
yes thats f*cking asuka
otakon: You're still going to suck.
I'm already in a bad mood anyways...
Dance shizu dance
really? huh. If an episode surprises me or makes me laugh, I love it. If there is some glaring problem or horrible moment in it, I don't like it.
All of a sudden I just got so gosh darn miserable...
Actually, kids they claim have ADD are actually going to be the smarter kids.
And my chest has been hurting a lot
Kawaii_icybeauti: That's always the case
is wrek streaming?
The ones with mental disabilities are geniuses
"Cutie Pox" for example. It was good... and bad.
I know I shoudlent use logic for cartoon shows but sometimes I need to use it
Owl that ends well in spanish its called buho de la discordia (the owl of discord)
WindWhistler: Then they prescribe meds, and their minds get trashed by them.
LOL
I still say that Owl is evil
dat pyro
Kawaii_icybeauti: I take meds. My mind isn't getting trashed.
PING
sup everypony
When it all boils down, I will never hate anything about thte show, IMO. It's well written, well animated, and it has some of the greatest songs of our time. Plus considering the fact that this show saved me from a neverending lifetime of anger, depression, suicidal thoughts, and angst.
Rex_Mundi: Owloysius?
*the*
In fact, I find the medicine to be a lifesaver
...Yeeeeeeeep, this is a Shizu stream.
WindWhistler: You aren't on ritalin, are you?
It saves me from making a fool out of myself
Kawaii_icybeauti, I was like that. I was VERY ADD (still am, I guess).
WindWhistler i went into depression last night for some reason
Kawaii_icybeauti: Vyvanse
AJIsAwesome: Winter Wrap Up still gives me goosebumps, especially during Twilight's part
tSparx: Yep, I so expected it to start hooting evily at the end of the episode.
AJIsAwesome: I certainly don't *hate* any of the episodes :P
^
WindWhistler: You must be an adult then. I mean when they prescribe it to like 5 year olds.
i like each episode equally
How good is the Demoman on MvM?
cachi01|phone:come to think of it i think its not even on my tv provider
Kawaii_icybeauti: I seem to recall taking Vyvanse my whole life...
Rex_Mundi: how can you hoot evilly? maybe shifty eyebrows perhaps but evil hootin?
tSparx: youre probaly a true brony then
I will let you know, Depression and Anger REALLY don't mix well.......
I didn't like "Suited for Success" simply because the ponies thought those WONDERFUL DRESSES were awful
Rex_Mundi: Aw, I love Owloysius <3 (to each his own though)
ha dat shizuka dancing thats great
along with Buspirone and Prozac
And I used to take Zoloft
That moment killed the episode for me.
WindWhistler: Guess your lucky then. I've heard many stories of people getting really messed up on meds like that.
lbelmore8 here in mexico we have discovery kids. Not hub :p so i have to watch MLP in fucking discovery kids :(
ouch
But to push out the moral of the episode, it fit well
otakon: Trust me, that Owl is up to no good.
flutter_spin: Suited For Success is one of my very favorites
okay brb trying out new controller
superretroworld: I don't wanna define what a "true" brony is, but I am a male in the 18-25 range who *adores* this show, so I probably am :D
otakon: And sucking at TF2?
/me wishing TF2 ran as smoothly as shizus
flutter_spin: Is that the one with Rarity creating the Gala dresses?
tSparx: but im under 18, so does that still count?
TEH GUARDIANS OF GAHOOLE
DocSane: oh trust me, its up there. The dresses alone tosses it up #17 on my list
So who is streaming?
cachi01|phone: I was just down in Costa Rica. Saw MLP on DKids
cachi01|phone: i just looked i have to watch it on treehouse
superretroworld: Oh certainly! I think anyone can be a brony!
How good is the Demoman on MvM?
WHY MUST WE HAVE LISTS
i'm 15 and am addicted to MLP
Reikim: I already suck at it, the controller can only improve my ability
I'm getting a new computer TOMORROW so I hope it runs TF2 good :3
Is the scout any good?
oh love suited for success. Well, I love all of rarity's episodes, that's jsut me.
ohai pony pepple
DJ_POn-3: I'm 14 and the same :P
k
IshNewLaptopPony: Hello!
Im 22 and I have cruches on the characters all the time
yay
Im also 14
superretroworld: But the overwhelming majority of the people outside the show's target demographic are in that demographic, that's all
me too DJ_POn-3
hey IshNewLaptopPony
Rex_Mundi: Funny how that works, huh?
im also 14 :)
yay again
I'd say any male fan of FiM is a Brony regardless of age. Any girl over the target demographic is also a Brony.
i'm 14 too
turning 16 in october
So many young kids in here...
I didn't care too much for "Sonic Rainboom" but Fluttershy's yay punches it up there :)
Wow, y'all are young >_>
AJIsAwesome: denoman is Pretty good fro destroying the tank from the last wave, other than that it can be useful
14 FTW
i'm 13
DocSane: Its just rediculously easy to fall n love with ponies.
Kandarihu That's because pegasister is a silly term that doesn' t roll trippingly off the tongue
turning 16 on November
tSparx: MLP wasn't just made for little girls. It was made for all people.
How about the Scout? Is he useful?
Hey IshNewLaptopPony! Nice you got a new computer! I'm getting a new one tomorrow :3
Unnr, indeed.
We're the youngens...You can ask off to scram off the lawn noq.
Rex_Mundi: But do you think of them as people or as ponies?
now*
Im 14 turning 74 tomorrow
YOU DANG KIDS
GET OFF MY LAWN
ikr i get all my friends except those stubborn one's to "Join the herd"
It doesn't surprise me there are young ones in here anymore. I'm currently 27
DocSane: they are characters...
WindWhistler: FINALLY, I've been waiting for someone to say that!:|
WindWhistler: The show had a target demographic, a marketing dept., a clear idea of who they were making the show for, and (more pertinently) who they were advertising it to.
/me Dances on WindWhistler's lawn
AJIsAwesome: Actually I'm only 16
WindWhistler u cant tell me what to do!
AJIsAwesome: Only during the first few waves, after that, it isnt that great unless you upgrade it alot
WindWhistler: And then suddenly all us college-age dudes showed up.
Rex_Mundi: Right, but consider the implications of saying you get crushes on them.
Lies, Spy is best money-grabber.
My mind right now is divided between PSO2 and the RNC
I'm 14 and will be 15 on December 6th :P
tSparx: Lauren Faust specifically stated it wasn't just made for little girls
/me planks on WhindWhistler's lawn
*Scout
Well, it is better that us youngons love the show. It's better than us being into the...ahem...expected stuff.
WindWhistler: That's not what I'm trying to say.
I will be 15 in march 10 :)
WindWhistler: A target demographic is purely a marketing thing.
The show was targeted for young children, but the show was MADE for all ages.
ohai reg- the chats dead isn't it
AJIsAwesome: WHAT YOU SAID
cachi01|phone: Wow, my bdays's 2 days before yours o.O
AJIsAwesome: Thanks, haha
Yep
I find MLP fans to be a good quality of fan.
WindWhistler: *throws rocks a window* stupid old people!
In all seriousness, I think age ruins the experience. If you talk and act like a mature adult that is 25... that makes you even cooler
DocSane: Not many implications, people have crushes on fctional characters all the time. I wasnt the only 1 year old with a crush on a certain Hyrulian princess I bet.
i wish they can make man vs machine for the xbox to
*10 I mean
They tend to genuinely like the show, as opposed to claiming they like it and then complaining all the time
DocSane: its one of the biggest too, probaly bigger then star trek
i wisht TF2 was on consoles
A lot of people have told me I act beyond my years....It feels strange at times.
I had a crush on Yukiko
Kawaii_icybeauti really? Your bday is also one of my best friends birthday lol
Rex_mundi i have crushes on cadnece , fluttershy, and rainbow dash
Rex_Mundi: I think DocSane's suggesting that crush = you wanna bone them.
March FTW
Persona 4 ftw
cachi01|phone: My brother is 2 days after yours, and my other one is 4 days after yours...Cool
tSparx: Actually, no.
By the way, one of you guys said something that reminded me of this picture: http://fav.me/d4mtms4
Perhaps a better way to define the standard of "above the target age" would be to consider the typical age demographic of the G4 toys, or the media of earlier generations.
I like pie
DocSane: Well I don't mean to put words in your mouth. Please, explain.
cachi01|phone: lol mine is on april 30
tSparx: I get pissed off at those who make that assumption.
13hai ponies
13enjoying?
OMG SHIZUKA
bye everypony i gotta go, see ya tomorrow for BMN
Yay it was me WindWhistler I WON
/me glomps Shizuka
EY Shizuka
So do I
I better go too :(
I prefer blueberry.
eeyup
Hugs Shizuka
Well, G1 was for little kids, and G2 was sorta made to try to keep that audience. G3 went back to little girls, and G4 is killing that target.
tSparx: No, it's that you can accept non-human characters as human very easily.
G'evening Shizuka!
My mom is here with my great aunt nelly
Yesh we are Shizuka!
She is 97!!!!!
*keep the older audience
They seem to be too busy taking themselves seriously, Shizuka.
DocSane: Ah!
DocSane: Haha, I see :)
G2 was one of the series I hated.......I DONT CARE ABOUT HIGH SCHOOL PONIES IN LOVE GODDAMMIT
No pie is better than teh Lemon Merengue
cachi01|phone: Congrats. Have an ASDF reference: http://fav.me/d4ydji6
cachi01|phone: 90210, in pony form
G2 wasnt too bad, it has its moments
tSparx: The difference between most MLP fans and, say, Adventure Time fans is that MLP fans seem to form very strong, visceral emotional connections with these characters.
cachi01|phone, that's G1.5
Man i wish i can get TF2 game for the P C console and play with some of you guys
0,14'MURICA
FUCK YEAH
WindWhistler lol i love that scene
cachi01|phone: but i wouldnt mind seeing the g4 ponies in love
Is TF2 availble online for consoles or purchase via copies of the game?
DocSane: I formed a strong visceral emotional connection with some video game characters that have hardly been fleshed out at all.
Moopy: tf2 is free to play
DocSane: I know I do! I've had dreams hanging out with the mane6, and I'd love to meet any one of them some day. And I have a legit crush on T-Sparx somedays :P
And Rengeteki...
TF2 is fun. It will be evern better when I get my new computer tomorrow :3
tSparx: A friend of mine was constantly giving me shit about my liking the show, saying that I was being pretentious to suggest it's anything more than a reasonably good cartoon with some pop culture references.
Oh lord...Rengeteki caused me a lot of pain
Keep the shippin outta mah beloved G4 ponies
*even
/me should have picked Rango foar A movie
well my computer grahics is crapy on mine
^
tSparx: Who is T-Sparx?
Is it wrong to cherish fictional characters?
im really enjoying mass effect 2
Ponies47: lets just hope it can run tf2
DocSane: Twilight Sparkle
robotdragon9: Don't play ME3
DocSane: tSparx = me, T-Sparx = her
WindWhistler: No. I'd say it's pretty common.
Ohai Saxy
tSparx: Ah.
superretroworld: Yeah. Like what happened the other day. -_-
i have the sony compaq computer dude
DocSane: Okay. Then my campaign to get a midboss recognized wasn't completely idiotic...
/me sobs
MEDIC IM BEING AXED BY A SHIZUKA
tSparx: Twi is an idealized nerd girlfriend.
Ponies47: what other day?
DocSane: T-Sparx and I are so similar, you have no idea.
inb4 someone yells medic
You so Saxy, and a pretender, SaxyPretender
What the heck are they doing?
Man stuff

It seems like womanly stuff
the valo sony compaq computer
hello everyone!
So is the Mass Effect 3 ending mediocre at best?
hello gig mac
What takes up more resources minecraft or tf2?
Big_Macintosh_1992: Hello!
i mean big mac
AJIsAwesome: it's pathetic at best
Theres a DLC which made the ending good
tSparx: There's a reason MLP resonates with older fans so well. It also proves that boys can very easily identify with girls.
hai Big_Macintosh_1992
if i do get the 3rd game ill just look up the new endings on youtube
hello AJIsAwesome and thelonepony
AJIsAwesome, what I've heard is that it's terrible at best. And the DLC didn't make things good enough.
pick which one i like best
/me licks Saxy's cheek
robotdragon9: Don't even bother getting the third game
DocSane: ABSOLUTELY AGREED!
0,14...
superretroworld: Oh I was playing MvM with some other boronystaters and I had a ton of lag. So I keept getting killed and such
0,14No.
robotdragon9: The endings are all the same.
MY DICK WILL REVEAL AGAINST ITS CREATOR
:(
I really do love the way this fanbase is blurring gender lines. (In a good way)
Kawaii_icybeauti: Same here.:)
tSparx: I have a theory that part of the show's appeal is that young teen boys very often find girls kind of mysterious, and there aren't many well-rounded portrayals of young girls in the media.
Saxy
That is one sexy cosplay.
/me nibbles Saxy's ear?
Ponies47: that sucks
mass effect 3 ending choosing: Pick a colour!
Lol boronystaters
id pick green splosions
tSparx: MLP is one of the very few that avoids the usual portrayals of them only being obsessed with romantic relationships.
Yeah, there's this barred sterotype for girl's televison that it MUSt suck, and this changed that....Well...if you count disney...
0,14dat Natsu is mai waifu
Natsu?
Kawaii_icybeauti: I think it goes beyond that
Who else is sick of phineas and ferb?
cachi01|phone: I am.
Who is this?
cachi01|phone: somewhat
Its all the same shit every episode
superretroworld: Yeah. At 1 point I need more metal for my sentry and I had no despencer set up. I tryed to walk over to crate but it was lagging so bad I couldn't get to it
cachi01|phone: You have NO idea how much I dislike the show.:|
Kawaii_icybeauti: MLP has a very easy femininity to it.
http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8s2a3XCDA1r06u14.jpg
DocSane: I've always been friends with lots of girls, and more open to girliness than most guys, and I have definitely noticed that bronies seem to understand girls better than most non-bronies
DocSane: Of course it's girly, the bright colors and the fantasy land does that
cachi01|phone: actually yes i hate it
DocSane: Tears down a lot of the usual assumptions about girls AND guys
I am sick of people shoving that show down my throat. I can't stand to watch a SINGLE episode.
0,14Taki's replacement in Soul Calibur
Who is Taki?
AJIsAwesome: which show?
0,14aka the character that chick is cosplaying
I thought it was ok
Big_Macintosh_1992: Phineas and Ferb.
/me actually likes phineas and ferb
AJIsAwesome: What show you talkin bout?
Ive always sort of liked girls, Peach being my favorite character in mario party since I first got the game back in the 90s
0,14Taki is the ninja girl from Soul Calibur
AjIsAwesome the mom.is so stupid
Okay then, I guess.
Kawaii_icybeauti: The fact that all the main characters are girls is so casually assumed and not an issue that it breaks down a barrier of mystery that can exists between boys and girls.
It just makes me rage
i dont really care bout phineas and ferb
Ugh, done with manechat.
/me doesn't mind Phineas and Ferb
BUCK PHINEAS AND FERB AND BUCK.THEIR SHOW
Hoy do you use italics Unnr?
Unnr: :[
Many girls shows make a huge deal about being "girly".
/)ō3ō(\
Every time they start debating worst/best episode, it's just annoying.
The show is okay, IMO. It's just that people kept trying to make me like the show more than I already and I hate it because of that.:|
Like Best Poni, onyl worse.
0,14Phineas and Ferb is alright
the reason i play TF2 on the xbox cause i play as egineer cause they take more shooting damage to the enimies better
*only
Oh phineas and ferb? That show came out I think it was beginning of 6th grade? I so still enjoy it, and across the second dimension was very well done. It sort of brought Disney out from the grave temporarily.
peach makes me angry, it's always either her or yoshi who beats me in mariokart
Not that I would ever consider stealing on but does Nintendo have the power to shut down a 3DS from anywhere?
*one
SaxyPretender it was alright but then every episode was the.samr
Some of the best girl characters are on boys shows, thats ironic
Same
lbelmore8: using /me like many things, its best used in moderation
lbelmore8: use /me :message:
13so much arguing :<
SpadeMagnes[R: probaly the internet but i dont think a 3ds
Rex_Mundi: Most shows ARE boy's shows, so that isn't surprising.
:c
Sorry, Shizuka.:$
Juliet starling is best zombie hunter
as it can be seen as role playing, but I tend to like to use it for Illeism
Shizuka: So how many side weapons are accessible to the Pyro?
/me Ordered three seasons of Angry Beavers for my Birthday yesterday
Thanks to all who tell me how
Girl shows and girl toys tend to push a single ideal of femininity and what girls are supposed to like.
Juliet is mah fave female videogame character
My sister watches power rangers yet she gives me crap about watching MLP
Its way worse with anime, female characters I mean
Big_Macintosh_1992: I LOVE Angry Beavers.
AJIsAwesome: right?
LOL new power rangers sucks
ah 90's television..I wish I was old enough to remember you...:(
Hey Shizuka I noticed your TF2 looks a little diffrent style then the most ours. Did you buy the CD-ROM for the game or somthing?
cachi01|phone: IKR?
Rex_Mundi: That's Japan playing to stereotypes for otaku.
AjIsAwesome who doesnt?
so when is the whole page of bronystate going to be updated to the whole page and stuff?
ive recently been watching the history of power rangers on TGWTG
The 90s was an awsome age to live:)
stereotypical*
lucky to the people that were fortunate enough to grow up in that...
robotdragon9: Same here. I need to get back on that.
you know a 90s show i like? CatDog idk why
Well, unless you consider being kickass with a rifle to be masculine.
0,14iirc, Ponies47, she's using the FrakenHUD mod?
CatDog is Awesome
So how many side weapons are accessible to the Pyro?
I fink the Manmelter is a beter Pyro secondary weapon
cool AJIsAwesome
Never like Catdog, even back then...
I dont liek shizus HUD
I love all those nick game shows and pokemon of course.
The slime is fucking disgusting
Pokemon season 1-4 <3
i was born in '97 so i barely remember the 90's :c
SpadeMagnes[R: What slime?
SaxyPretender: Could be. :/
in the nickolodeon game shows
The last region that had a decent show going for it was RBY/S/E
*born 1990* heck yeah!
robotdragon9 1998 here lol
SpadeMagnes[R: Oh yeah.....
the green goop
robotdragon9: oh well... at least you have 2k to... yeah... 2000's sucked
I liked pokemon then it started to suck
^
There were plenty of good 2000's shows
Early was okay...9/11 was when everything went downhill
The kanto season had a lot of move errors
lbelmore8: right around the third batch of pokemon... I lost interest
Like Bulbasaur using whirlwind <.<
/me doesn't remember the templed themed game show on Nickolodeon...:(
XDDD
LOLWUT XDDDD
*temple*
well im gonna go now see u guys later
robotdragon9: Bye!
AJIsAwesome: I used to watch reruns on Nick GAS. I fell in love with it.
Cartons started to go down in quality as the 2000s went on, Lunatic unleashed anyone?
bye robotdragon9
Didnt knew they did bulbasur use whirlwind
AJIsAwesome: oh... I do... why can't i think of the name...
LOL
Rex_Mundi: I saw a few of those.
Big_Macintosh_1992: G3 FTW!!
The GS pokeball was a wasted plotline
It never got expanded on
Lunatics........ oh yeah i remember those superheroes roght?
Teen titans was my favorite cartoon show of the mid 2000's.
Furry superheroes
^^
Evil beware
We have waffles
Oh goodie another worthless crate
I hated teen titans
I actually kind of wanted a game where the combat was based off the show, where you could command your pokemon to dodge attacks and perform certain commands.
What, taras strong was in there...
But with MLP FIM, Avatar the last airbender, and other awesome shows, i think cartoons are good again, finaly having left the cartoon wasteland of the late 00s. Regular show is cool.
WEEEE
Adventure TIme is a lot of fun too
Regular show and adventure time are awesome
AJIsAwesome: Oh... its Legends of the Hidden Temple
What happened to Ibelmore8?
Idl
K
I also missed toonami...Naruto and samuri jack kicked so much ass.
Guys remember gargoyles?
Fuck Naruto...
AJIsAwesome: "poof"
Rex_Mundi: somewhat
Oh yeah, Samurai Jack was a good 2000's cartoon
Rex_Mundi: My brother loved that one, and he still has the toys
tSparx: i agree
Kind of wished Naruto would stayed in the "kid" saga.
*would've*
There really are plenty, but my mind is blanking and I'm too busy fiddling with chatzilla settings to look some up
Samurai Jack GODDAMIT I NEVER KNEW IF HE RETURNED TO HIS WORLD
Kawaii_icybeauti: It was cool, also BEAST WARS, best transformers ever.
I'm back
what I miss?
Rex_Mundi: You're actually a year older than my eldest brother.
im front!
Wb otakon
i just started watching regular show on vacation... in the US... and i live in canada... WHY?!?! :'(
Ded
Shippuden is okay to me, but not as addicting as the original Naruto was.
Rex_Mundi: I loved that show as a kid, but it has not stood up to me watching it now.
otakon: we are talking about cartoons, now and in the past

I think Ibelmore8 is making a pessimistic comment and then leaving.
it was my fav untill MLP came along
I'm not too sure what

SpadeMagnes[R: Because he doesn't wear pants, right?
Shizuka: ma steam crashed
I knew it
But then she gets off at the same stop as you and walks along the same path
cachi01|phone: they shouuld be banned, for saying 'canadians are weird'
Coltown
Why that is even a issue I dont get
You keep your distance from her and try your best not to look like a stalker until you reach your destination, and again no interaction
superretroworld lol
A couple days later, you take the bus home again and she gets on, again
SpadeMagnes[R: The same reason they banned a book because two male penguins tried to hatch an egg
tSparx: You should checkout 'escape for midnight castle', for an 80s cartoon its alright. Its certainly interesting watching 80s ponies getting draged away screaming by their necks...
"It offended someone"
SpadeMagnes[R: I don't know. The same reason "Loser" is censored in the Canadian version of MLP.
i think this is the longest bronystate topic ive seen
Rex_Mundi: And dont forget the sea ponies!
you notice she glances at you for a nanosecond and smiles then looks away
GO SHIZU GO <3
How is loser offensive?
Once again same thing as before, no interaction and ignore her
Unnr: that G3 ponies...
God people are oversensitive these days
HUZZAH! THE PYRO HAS BEEN DOUBLED!
Rex_Mundi: But, but minty is luff
Unnr: I have a minty toy in my room from childhood.
That guy who wrote Fahrenheit 451 had the right idea
Then it happens a third time
Something offends someone? Burn it.
Ponies47: Calm down, take it easy.:S
Kawaii_icybeauti: Oh yes, one WTF monont indeed.
well now its time to say it, canadians are weird
So what do you do now
SpadeMagnes[R: It's the price we pay for having been undersensitive in the past. We'll level out to proper levels of sensitivity at some point.
Kawaii_icybeauti: See! Also minty was the original Luna in Socks
Do you A)Attempt to make interaction this time and try to befriend her
/me Flips a table
Ponies47 annoying orange show is junk but man DABUQ IS WRONG WITH U. All those shows are amazing!
GO SHIZU! <3
B)Continue to make no interaction and not seem like a creep
Unnr: They should shove a minty in the backround.
You hate the Regular Show *and* Adventure Time?
or C) Hey I just met you, I know it's crazy, but heres my number, so call me maybe
cachi01|phone: To each their own, guys.
/me flips a table right back at you!
Unnr: You watched the Poney pokey video about watching G3, didnt you?
Burn ALL the offensive stuff
:P
Kawaii_icybeauti: S3's Derpy Sighting would be amazing to switch to Minty
Okay, I'm gonna watch The Daily for the first time in weeks. Later, all.
tSparx: YES! It's all garbage!
You go A
I hate adventure time
A for sure.

Rex_Mundi: What?!?
Unnr: Nope. We need Wind Whistler sighting
Wait, how can you hate regular show o.O? Okay, adventure time is a litte strange for my taste, but REGULAR SHOW??

Ponies47: Well, I vehemently disagree, but I'm certainly not angry about your opinion :)

To each their own, everyone. We have to remember that we can't all like the same things in life.:S

Reikim: not like I can read it
I don't hate Ponies47 for not liking Adventure Time or Regular Show, because I don't like Phineas and Ferb. It's just not appealing to me.

Anyway
Hey everyone, is there like an official timezone we use for BronyState and/or the chat?
