05heres to hopign for competent team members
*called
inb4 Adventure Time metaphor
inb4 DERRRP
and ponies far in our future were geneticfally engineered to do magic for us and be self aware
i still dont get the inb4 thing
just minus the fighting
also, does pony world (not just equestria) have time zones?
and if there are more regions than equestria, do they each have there own princess's that raise a localized moon and sun to fit their time zones?
FOR LUNA
/me salutes!
Wait... isn't a monarchy when there is only one leader?
inb4 oligarchy?
a dictatorship is a "political" method of someone ruling a country or province by there own,
while a monarchy is a "religous" method of someone ruling a country or province by blood, e.g. our rolyal family (even though they have little to no control over the country now)
Ahhhhhhhhh I see
MUTINY
Reminds me of the time when I wiki'd anarchy to find how the anarchy symbol had anything to do with anarchy and scrolled down to a section that had "Leaders of anarchy groups".
And I was thinking: wait a second...
Isn't anarchy supposed to have no leaders? 6_9
well
anarchy is just messing shit up all through time
I still haven't got a clue why that 'A' is the symbol for anarchy. :3
Munay don't grow on trees
I got bills to pay

Several things: His email could of been entered incorrectly, his email is already registered or the website was being an arse at the time.
Other then that I would have no idea.

He would have to contact Knighty or someone else.
Are you not entering something correctly? A field is empty and requires filling?
my email it says its wrong but i cheeked it it corect
Is this during registration on Fimfiction?
or on Gmail?
yes
fimfiction
or something similar to that
mabby its my compter
Most likely not.
ill try that
right
I'm not sure then
05therainbowvortex: its spelled "sign"
as long as it has @live.com or whatnot at the end it should send an email even if that email exists or not

I mean, does it restart or do you keep playing until you win?
you keep playing until you win
or everyone quits
... Yeah, stock weapons aren't entirely good for MvM
Only a few are good
Like heavies minigun and flamethrower (airblast cost)
I'm like "why bother if I can't beat it with standard weapons"
Just the satisfaction of saying you won.
I see Pony

00,03CHOCALATE RAIN!

He's thinking Elementalist. Also, we are playing together. We have to consider co-op abilities
00,10and realy every tf2 item is just a trade off.

I'm beat.
Ugh, this is annoying.

08,01what kind of strings?
Saturn: Bass Guitars have a strange form on the strings.

00,02i *should'nt* skip the lecture
Like the 3 deeper tones on normal Guitar, that kind of string
00,02but its techincally optional and takes longer to travel than lecture

Hi everypony
Awesome TheRhythm demo is out in America finally
but can you just restore it to stock?
I think it's not a problem of getting rid of it, just the factor of it existing on the device when it was shipped.
Reminds me of the iTouch incident a few years ago.

Goodbye everyone :0

Did you get a set then, or just buy a printer?
*other
I bought the printer
but for the price of printers these days… its pretty affordable and plastic is cheap
How much was the printer?
$600
Huh, that's less than I was expecting. O_o
www.solidoodle.com
theres a huge lead time though
12 weeks id estimate
thats my forum above, if you want to join, its dedicated to solidoodle 3d printing.
hahaha lol
Lawl
Undercut them
:P
/me noms on GigabitHarmonie's ear. :3
Guten Tag, everypony!
Oh! My ear!
Dat wall of text :$
Well for my cheapo $600 printer, it uses ABS plastic
Ahh, cool
or you can use PLA, which is a natural biodegradable plastic made from corn startch
But for the more expensive printers
like $50k and up
they can use up to 50 different types of materials
its crazy.
Hah, damn
I'm not used to associating T-Sparx with guns when Pinkie's not around.
http://www.soliforum.com/topic/63/brads-solidoodle-unboxing/
wow
Hey, I have a laptop that is... um... I don't know how old it is
I can for this one too if I wanted to
but would be a dvi monitor
That's a pretty good size
Is it an angry smiley?
Just got into it hahahaha
Ive got no shame in saying its one of the very few rare gems of current animated cartoons.
*going
RRRRAAAWWWEEEEEERRR!!!!!! :D
You gunna try and paint it?
Theology?>
*Theology?
yes
Have you made a Dash yet? :P
Gotta get the right acrylic paints though in the right colours
Ill do a dash tonight
05hows that?
Ooh, I do enjoy typing in smileys and getting ponies :D
If you want one ill make you one and send it to you.
They dont cost very much to make.
>_><_< <---when did these get added?
That would be brilliant, thanks
I just dont have a rarity model yet
the mane is screwing up my printer
too many thin walls
Ahh
Plus Derpy, Trixie, and Swetiebelle
that was weird
...
Dash has I think… 5 or 6 pieces
twilight had 4
:3
Maybe it's the 18 GBs of Derpy pic I saved up on this 6gb laptop. :P
pics
18Gbs on a 6Gb laptop?
are you in US or UK? I forgot
Where did the other 12Gb get stored?
Derpy flew north for the winter!
UK, do you have paypal?
Ye- ....uh no. :(
yes
brb
http://i.imgur.com/dSnVX.jpg
Help. I accidentaly 18 gb derpy? Is this dangerous?
3 hour print, 1 piece
wings didnt work.
no
Hah, that's awesome
It'd be cool to see an ep where Pinkie and Derpy chill out xD
Some people want to see less of Pinkie actually. :/
oh!
Definitely Dash. :P
Ill make one tonight.
you can paint it if you want.
Some people exaggerate
Twilight and RD get the most IMO.
I made some ABS cement, it works great, can hardly tell they are glued together
o_o
Yeah, they look gerat
great*
I bet someone's actually done, like, an official count.
I wish we get more Applejack too :D
How much screentime, how much dialogue time.
Hah
I just watched that
I just want more ponies period ,3
XD
<3 *
LOL
zcorp is alright for models
but for anything functional
its very very expensive.
Its not a real plastic, zcorps use fused powder.
That wrench cost over $200 in powder and binding agent.
Pinkie, less or more it's fine by me.
1kg of ABS plastic for my printer costs <$50
:P*
Applejack is the shortchanged one
Hahahaha, wow
Look up "objet 3d printer"
I think season 2 had a bit too much Pinkie and Fluttershy
and be amazed. Objet makes the best ones, very expensive, but the models can be function, tough, and look good.
Yeah, I really misspoke earlier. I don't think Fluttershy has the least screentime.
But, I feel like she's the least developed as a character.
/me Returns
yeah, i would agree on that
anyone up for some MvM? and hello ponies :)
yes
Good evening
FDM printers work that way
Fused Disposition Modeling.
Theres a different kind of printer that works backwards
O_o
and the model is up side down
Oh no no, we're not gonna get into a ranking discussion again, haha
In order I would guess in episodes, 1.Twi 2.Pinkie 3.Rainbow Dash 4.Fluttershy 5.Rarity 6.Appleajck, and there is also the CMCs
Or was it 5th place she took? :/
No no no
and theres a pool of special photo-curing resin
NO NO NO
Let me count...
DON'T WASTE OUR TIME WITH IT, we all have different opinions on ponies, we *just* did this yesterday, didn't we?
and the finished prints are not very strong.
Didn't somepont do the math on screentime
*somepony
Are we having this "Best Pony" argument again?:|
Yeah, really, let's not do this.
I read it once, I want it on me now to use in this discussion
Wait a second
Well you can't be developed if you are not on screen
Damn disconnect
Because that would be fucking awesome
I like Rarity how she is :)
Character Development =/= Character Growth.
At its most basic, it's learning about the char's
Yep
anyone feel up for some MvM?
Last Roundup was the Derpy episode right?

good evening
I heard somewhere that Luna was best pony
Hi guys
Derpy Doo was said by one of the creators.
There goes my savings for university. :P
How is the name Derpy not an insult?
Either trlling or plain stupid...I can't tell.
no no
could be stupid
it's very possible when dealing with these people
Well people get offended by offended by everything
oops
derp
Like that.
lawl
I get offended by people being offended by Derpy.
Are you still into lasers then?
I like derpy
I should call her " Grey Mare", but it's too insulting
and freedom
*retarted*

A mine would be more apt
my headcannon: it used to be a regular farm, but then the parapsrites showed up and ate everything, then they switched to rocks
Think of this. Maybe they collected the rocks because they had gems inside, only they had to give them to the unicorns to break open
There we go
They moved the rocks around to foster gem

Over the Hedge
i kinda liked that movie
aND?
No, I mean, once I start listening to something on repeat, I literally cannot stop listening to it. Strange compulsive habit of mine. XD
My favourite movie
I mean whats the point of giving Dash a pet and never bring it up again
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-7rVdXXwds
I don't think tank wasn;pt cute enough for the audience
I thought he was cute...
i liked him....
Well the point is why give her a pet and never mention him again
Well, it was meant to explore dealing with jealousy.
I dont like it when shows create characters soley for a plot and then they get forgotton
Kind of "hey we need to do something for the lesson here" which I think hurt the episode
Whenever its an event-centric or character-development episode, it rules
Whenever it is some weird lesson, it suffers
One of the worst lessons was in MMMontFE
Maybe they'll expand their character. Maybe they won't. In the end, we shouldn't really complain about it.
http://youtu.be/pJ_jdruQca0
I hated how Pinkie Pie somehow had to be the lesson object of "Don't make baseless accuations"
it got cut though
Kind of like the extended backstory of Derpy. They had to cut that out too.
yet a character can be imperfect.
Which makes an interesting episode :)
i didnt care for that episode
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Budding Friendships OST Released
i watched it live here
ugh. Let me consult my episode fav list
I know characters should have flaws but the mane 6 can be real jerks to eachother sometimes
"Owl's Well That Ends Well" is 3rd worst episode on my list
0,14oh hai
do you want FiM to be like G3?
Hi saxy :
<.<
13SuperBrony64: you're up
Oh hey, a Saxy.
<><
"Over a Barrel" was my 2nd worst episode
Dang I missed the sea ponies...
so...how about that lady rainicorn baby?
heh.
SpadeMagnes they grow they die they reborn the grow they die
I dont think cadance is immortal like Luna and Celestia.
A different breed of alicorn?
oh
worst episode....ummm...My least favorite would be owl
my least favorite is owl's well ends well.
We still dont know if tia and luna are inmortal
I think alicorns are just automatically proclaimed "princess ponies"\
is anything playing for anyone?
why does everyone hate the owl episode?
Yeah, like there are "normal" Alicorns like cadance, and then there are Celestia and Luna...
Idj
is anything playing?
My 4th worst episode: "Swarm of the Century" I don't know. I hated how every pony ignored Pinkie Pie. I just kept shouting at the screen, "SHE KNOWS!!!!"
How is it accurate? Alicorn is just a name for the material unicorn horns are supposedly made of.
Well Pinkie pie being pinkie pie... would you ever take her seriously?
Hey, she identified them. I would have listened.
I thought that was real..I even texted my friends...
Besides, she isn't 2sided. Pinkie has her moments.
guys, is anything playing?
Boo
yo
neat
Hi everypony <3
But most of my ratings are based on how much I personally liked the episode, if there wasn't some glaring flaw that bothered me the entire time
STREAm
/me thinks the worst episode was the Hearth´s Warming Eve one
I dont have a favourite episode
TF2!!!
the buffalos
whos streamin?
Whoes streaming?
T.F.2!!!!
I liked that one fine, wasn't my fav or anything but.
The vission has been doubled!
I have blood in my ear again 8)
Wait i mean i dont have a not liked episode
>.<
ikr
I don't like every episode, and there are some I haven't even watched all of, but I don't think they're objectively bad.
I dont know
I didnt really like the premise of the Mare do well episode
except the not watching every episode :P
engineers all like "haters gonna hate"
can't stand*
Man this place sure is lively
If I ever NOT like an episode, I would lke the moral behind it. As long as the episode as a moral behind it, I'm fine with it.
Would I get a lot flak if I admitted that I don't like the CMC eps very much?
oh talking about episodes eh?
The CMC episodes aren't that good...
for some reason, i like to say that xenomorphs have a nest on a contienent far from equestria in my fanon.
They all act like idiots
I mean COME ON
I also can't watch show stoppers because I'm watching them deny their talents...I can't stand it.
The thing is, the CMC are embarrassing to watch. They just goof around doing crazy things.
children are naive sometimes
I bet they have ADHD or OCD or something
must explain why they're such idiots
ADD was created by companies to sell ritalin.
*out of the CMC ones
Season 2 is going to premiere i think in 7 months here in mexico
You would think with all the shit the CMC they would have cause millions of damage or something
*do
"Sisterhooves Social" has to be in the top 20 favorite episodes on my list
SpadeMagnes lol
hi guys
I have ADHD and OCD and Aspergers
finally got me a wired controller
now brb
owl that ends well, the last roundup, and a friend in deed are my favourites
RRRRRAAAAWWWEEEERRRRRR
Actually, kids they claim have ADD are actually going to be the smarter kids.
And my chest has been hurting a lot
The ones with mental disabilities are geniuses
"Cutie Pox" for example. It was good... and bad.
I know I shoudlent use logic for cartoon shows but sometimes I need to use it
Owl that ends well in spanish its called buho de la discordia (the owl of discord)
LOL
I still say that Owl is evil
PING
*the*
^
i like each episode equally
cachi01|phone:come to think of it i think its not even on my tv provider
I didn't like "Suited for Success" simply because the ponies thought those WONDERFUL DRESSES were awful
along with Buspirone and Prozac
And I used to take Zoloft
That moment killed the episode for me.
ouch
But to push out the moral of the episode, it fit well
WHY MUST WE HAVE LISTS

/me planks on WhindWhistler's lawn
*Scout
The show was targeted for young children, but the show was MADE for all ages.
Yep
In all seriousness, I think age ruins the experience. If you talk and act like a mature adult that is 25... that makes you even cooler
*10 I mean
They tend to genuinely like the show, as opposed to claiming they like it and then complaining all the time
i wisht TF2 was on consoles
A lot of people have told me I act beyond my years....It feels strange at times.
I had a crush on Yukiko

Many girls shows make a huge deal about being "girly".

The show is okay, IMO. It's just that people kept trying to make me like the show more than I already and I hate it because of that.:|
