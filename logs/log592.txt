Hello everypony, what did I just miss? :S
Morning MegaMoonShine
Ah i see :)
I'm still awake.
Kops: One off the better Swedish Movies
Wrek|Observiking: And some of the few europeans and scandinavians that just got up :P
Just be the better man sometimes the best way to deal with something is to walk away
wuut...?
are we talking about real life confrontation? If there is a possibility to settle the dispute go for it. If the other person is clearly just looking for trouble then leave it be.
So glad we made it
Soooooooo glad we made it!

Give me some lovin'!
Everyday day!

05I DUNNO
00,02Wrek|Observiking, streams free
inb4 a cable doesnt detatch and the rover is flung into a rock
05ive never implied it :P
00,02TrixieMuffins, ikr
inb4 parachute tears
00,02incredible bit of engineering
or snaps off
00,02and none of it can be tested before launch
Well, I presume they can simulate it
00,02i meen sure you can fire air over the chute but its not the conditions it will be in when actually hitting mars
Hopefully not in KSP
00,02Very_Silly_Filly, hopefully

Nighty night TheGreatAndPowerfulT
My Celestia i love the soundtrack on this game

Vordox: Starfarer... I think...
its Starfarer i looked it up
Derpdash: Lol that's not the ost. It's some songs from spotify.
oh
i still love these songs :P
sounds good anyway
Does fit well with the game

Seems like a sandbox, do whatever you please sorta game

seeya cypresswolf
Bye cypress
Later cypresswolf :)
Haio, everybrony.
hey
Hello CountDoofus
Chat is so dead
it died a true death
Might as well start up a conversation
hmm
So... I have to make a text based adventure game
And I was coming up with ideas...
whats it about?
I was thinking...
Kerbal Space Program Escape!
Where Kerbals try to overthrow the user as they are fed up with Phase4 massacring htem all to the moon
00,02^fund it
i havent played that so im not sure what your on about sorry :D
Awww
Well it's a school assignment
Good morning everypony.
Mornin' makoton
how old are you adam?
Good morning makoton :)
only 16 :P
/me ditches muffins at MegaMoonShine
What is Up and what is this!?
pretty good to be making text adventures
Starfarer TheRandomkid321, and hi :)
ive only done a few basic flash stuff
Yeah I'm doing 1 & 2 IT Software Apps this year...
Might be doing 3 & 4 next year
cool the school i was at stopped me doing media cos of the goverment rules
But then you may have a different education system where you come from and have no idea what I'm talking about xD
well i did my flash stuff there like making games and england sucks
Is there that 1&2 and 3&4 system in other countries?
nah
Yeah thought so
but i know what you mean xD
country barriers eh?
morning, everypony :)
morning
Mornin' Sylandest
howdy, AdamTheDuck, dentidiot :)
not much going on this side
morning, Sylandest :)
morning, MegaMoonShine :)
And I was thinking one of the Kerbals will find a trojan horse and disguise himself to escape the wrath of Phase
or maybe use the window logo to break a hole into the monitor
whats the original game about?
Well if you watch some of Phase's streams, you build spaceships
and try and send these green guys
called kerbals to the moon and stuff
hmm dosent sound too bad
Think spore
but physics apply your ships
in space?
right, ill have to look it up
Yeah
dentidiot: But because you end up experimenting with different ship designs, Kerbals are always killed in the process of a test launch
so the better and more efficient you are the less kerbals are killed
And I think Wrek just plays to kill kerbals in the most imaginative way possible
No kerbals aren't a major thing in the game
but there an extra incentive?
All you're really doing is trying to see how well your designs fly
Yeah that little effort to keep your kerbal/kerbals alive
or kill them, dosent matter xD
Sometimes you can get your kerbal stranded on the moon
yeah Wrek just kills them all xD
GOOD IDEA
There is always something about rebellion type stories/games that just warm my heart
Only to see everyone die horribly
prinny anyone? xD
too obsure right
Prinny?
yesh
well im gonna go seeya everypony :)
laters, dentidiot
Cya dentidiot :)
Cya dentidiot
05FUCk
Wait.. was it wrek or sumica who kills kerbals?
AdamTheDuck: sumica
Oh that's right...
How many mods stream on BronyState?
I only know Phase, Wrek and the Allegro and Giga podcast
I'm Back biches. I had to do something for a bit.
Welcome back
SuperBrony64 used to stream didnt he?
I'm never on when he does I think >.<
Think I saw him stream Black Ops once though
I just havnt seen one of his streams in ages. WHich is upsetting because he was always my favorite streamer.
chat derped
alexxm I thought it was silence.
Who streams at the movie nights?
TheRandomkid321: Most mods can stream, And some does when they have time. But there are the more regular streamers then the others who are around usually
Adam: normaly it is suumica who streams movie night
Cool
Im gonna take a wild guess here and say that wrek is streaming?
Yeah
Such a total war...
WWITH PONIES
TheRandomkid321: What gave it away?
Is it going in slow motion for anypony else or just me?
Slow motion or jittery?
It seems to go in slow motion, and skips every few seconds.
I'm on my old computer and I'm XDCCing files 3 at a time.
Hmm it's going normal for me.
Well that may explain it :P
Wrek's so in perile
Told ya :P
ded?
05this time
HOLY FUCK DED
ARMADA!
05dont engage superior armadas
^
Dat blitzkreig
I am good at sketching human anatomy... Pony anatomy though... UNfortunatly no... That would be pretty cool though...
but you don't have to draw hands :3
05that went well :3
05and yeah i realize this isnt the most exciting thing to watch
05but its an waesome game
AdamTheDuck Usually I hide the hands fromt he image such as having the person hiding behind something partially or hands in pockets.
pretty awesome for me to watch anyway, love these types of games
Does this game have multiplayer. It would be pretty cool if so
TheRandomkid321: Yeah but when your logo design for a VCD assignment involves a clear hand and you spend 50 sketches trying to get the fingers right...
This is Starfarer correct? single-player only if so
Chezne: yep
its 11 where I am mates. I gotta hit the hay... Then mayby sleep after I am done beating the hay sensless.
lol another australian
well I'll go sleep as well. Night everyone :)
05for now
I wish I didn't read that.
is this that SPAZ game?
Nope
it's Starfarer
Pretty awesome steam just recently released a HD overhaul of MDK2
05fuck yeah!
05gotta get that
05love the MDK series
ohai Bronystate
Wrek|Observiking: Yeah i really want to get the HD version, already got MDK 1 from a while back so hehe :P
What's this?
Starfarer
Hey everypony

MadSurge: you mean having him draw you something ya say?
killerpony7733: yep

MadSurge: But wouldn't you have to commission him?, I doubt he does it for free unless for some kind of reason i would not know
Wrek|Observiking: Hey that reminds me you said you were going to continue that ponified Jensen drawing you started on like alot of weeks ago when you go back
killerpony7733: I know right

RaveBrony i'm ok right now.......it feels worse (spongebob reference) AT NIGHT
Lol! :D
dat quote is used for everything ...AT NIGHT
You know what? Space Ghost once asked the Foo Fighters if they are fighting for the Foo or for the Foo. Since this was a SGC2C interview, of course they never gave a straight answer.
Morning, guys. Morning, Wrek
/me attacks andalite
I remember when Space Ghost interviewed ATHF (in their pilot version)

05it would be the front line tank basically
Front Line Tank...
05takign the fire form the fighters while still having massive firepower
NLR BROHOOF
hm METAL GEAR
NLR Big Macintosh?
05for isntance i jsut bought one of the strongerst energy weapons for it
Left 4 Tanks
I think those who play with this might also enjoy X+ Reunion
NLR Applejack
X+=X3
Wrek|Observiking: The McIntosh
how about Celstias middle hoof
My Little airship
I think it's more of a manly Tank, so Big Macintosh for me :P
anyways, I'm off to do some killer politics. That's what happens in Crusader Kings 2.
Tactical Friendship Envoy
My Little Tank-a-jack
like gods middle finger cept with ponys :D

hm elements of badassery?
NLR RD's Tank. :D
Dermathil what sort of stuff do you do
The Applespacebucker
alexxm: In Crusader Kings 2 or something else?
i think one of the elements of badassery would be Explosions and another would be one liners
yeah Dermathil
MASF123: I just need to clear something out with a mod
Awww, can't fit in Big Macintosh?
hiya everypony
hiya Bronysith :)
how've you been Bronysith
yay he chose one of my suggests
alexxm: good. just going to get started on some writing. ive been neglecting for a while. damn steam sales
hi Bronysith hows the dark side of the force treating you?
alexxm: oh. I am a chronical backstabber who's trying to wrestle control of Iceland and the islands bordering england to declare independence from Norway. The bodycount from my assassins is in the at least double digits.
Dermathil, ask for Sumica, he might still be here
Quick_Thinker: im a gray sith you tard
thanks MASF
well thats just being rude now dont you think Bronysith?
Quick_Thinker: im a sith

point taken
BIG FIGHT INCOMING
This is gonna be huuuuuge! :O
he be hoofed
Go go Big Mac!
MORE DOTS MORE DOTS... I mean MORE DEPLOY more Deploy!

very nice music fits how the battle is going
Yeah, very fitting indeed
Thumpers fired
Next order Commander Wrek. *salute*
naw man those are celestias middle hoof :S
Know what would be awesome...
even though that would be impossible to have a middle hoof
This is 3D enviroment or in cockpit/ship RPG
But the gameplay to be in 2D
Like current
WOULD BE AWESOME
05there
05now my main battleship has all the newest weaponry
Big Mac ready to be sailed, Commander Wrek!
/me glomps Vordox in the shins
how the hell did it get upgrades on the fly man the future kicks ass
/me does a spin in air and lands stationary, still in Salute.
What about our own Star Cruiser ship, Commander Wrek?
fun fact: my crusader kigns 2 game right now is pretty darn hard. Playing as a catholic heretic in iceland who also managed to take over the canary islands through good marriages and assassinations.
Not worthwhile to upgrade at the current time, Commander?
Vordox if Wrek told you to jump into space without spacesuit would you do it?
Quick_Thinker: Of course not Sir.
Sir huh guess im a commander to :D
BIGEST MISTAKE EVER
War front incoming, pirate fleet
ALL MAN THE STATIONS! We're going in!
Commander Wrek, fleet is ready!
^ is getting a bit to much into this
Quick_Thinker: Don't bucking care.
I would love a multiplayer version of this game
anypony seen Picture Perfect Pony PMV?
ME
LOVE IT
RainBowJack: It's Ooooold
i love it too
its so well done
Vordox OLD IT CAME OUT TODAY
It's GENIUS! :O
Sightings at 11 o clock Commander Wrek.
i tought NO NOT AGIAN LEAKED song season 3
RainBowJack they've leaked another one?
We're surrounded, Commander!
Come on little mare shake that PLOT
you got the prank on EqD didn't you
Engaging defense formation.
Vordox: its from yesterday.. why do you consider it old?
http://cheezburger.com/6437911552
alexxm: Nope, original song
shana: Anything on the internet older then 2 hours is old.
its not leaked OC, it was written by mandopony
Recharged Shields, at optimal lux.
Vordox: ponies are old?
so my new chapter for my little spelunky is still new glad to hear that
Dermathil: Since 1980s, yes
http://cheezburger.com/6463377408
3 o'clock or 8 o'clock, your decision, Commander Wrek.
Hi all
just asking has any pony even seen a spelunky fan fic before i know its odd to make one for an indie game but i think theres like 10 for limbo
Hi Eli :)
Smaller sightings of group o 2 at 11 O'clock
how've you been Eli
Bronysith: Symbolism!
alexxm: fine as always^^
Retreated Ships. Turning around for helping out NLR Thermapyle.
http://cheezburger.com/6467275264
Wrek: YOu need to draw a cockpit with you as Commander of it with a crew. :P
:o
Id like to see that :D
That'd be awesome
I think Wrek would like it too :P
That's why I suggested him into a vision of it.
I would gladly be a cockpit member. :)
http://cheezburger.com/6469775104
Hehehe... Duchess Lauren of Orkney has inherited the County of Caithness and all lower titles. (She's my daughter in Crusader Kings 2)
Are you able to upgrade your main ships propulsion?
05yeah but it would take weapon space
Dang
weapons are best pony
05besides now i have a strong enough fleet to tackle most things. now i can save up for the real capitol ships
:o
do I hear something about a space RTS?
ATTACK CORPORATE
I need to not listen to pony music while sleeping
Why not, Alpha-Omega-Prime?
05lets see what the high end stuffcosts
Well I wake up to a song I like and start singing it
Wrek|Observiking: what's the music you're playing now called?' i like it
05150k
XD
Start farming!
anyone have Spore?
Has anypony tried the space rts Sword of the Stars 2?
Now I only have 3 hours of sleep
haven't played that in.... forever
Are all those things meant to be ships?
In the circle
05yeah
05its my fleet
Ahh, thought so
05miniature versions of allt he ships i own
....?
Are you able to replace your main ship with something else?
05yeah once i find one
05you can set which one to be your main
Coooool
That is pretty cool
I'm having so much fun right now. I've been declared to be the chancellor of Norway for the nth time since my diplomacy score is 10 points above the "masterful" rank (which is 15)...
05playign civ or?
Some game called Crusader Kings 2
hello everypony
Hey CCCP
hi Barbetos|AtWork

Hi CCCP
CCCP: Hiya :3

'mornin
hi MegaMoonShine and Chrysalis :)
05time for a massive fleet attack
how you doing cachi01 and Chrysalis
hi cachi01
MHi alexxm Alpha-Omega-Prime killerpony7733 MegaMoonShine cachi01 Chrysalis and everypony
hi alexxm im cool thx for asking and you?
i'm good cachi01
hi RainBowJack and CCCP!
I feel like my long name is a nuisance
AOP
I hate it when that internet derp happens
hmm?
it happens
yeah I'm playing Crusader Kings 2 wrek. Politics in the 11th century on a character-by-character basis. Goal is to make your dynasty be as successful as possible. made by Paradox Games.
d
ed
chat?
seems like it
probably.
So Wrek. Thinking about a drawing of you commanding inside a Cockpit? :P
05its itneresting :P
But it requires heavy background focus
Not inside a cockpit. He'd be standing on the main bridge of a mothership darth-vader style
X
(without the evil that is)
garagebanf is fun to mess with
I'm not sure that's the thing he's thinkng off.
-band
Wait till Wrek atleast has a chance to ight against capitol fleets...
It'
It'll be like a celebration :P
yay moar cave story for me
05that fleet has 3 capitol ships
05several carriers
05and a shitload of fighters
Hope you saved, Wrek XD
I'm slowly working towards icelandic independence from Norway.
/me does not like microstradegy games
seems like you could take on a small fleet
Alpha-Omega-Prime: would you rather prefer political grand strategy games?
05goan save to 90k
05and egt a level 1 capitol ship
Of 3 levels?
/me Does not like any strategy game
05yeh
Isn't it better to aim for Level 3 Cap ship for 150k?
It's just 60k more
Better aim for the highest due to a non curving income
05you see the ship doesnt have any equipment
05so the total cost ends much higher
Oh...
Not able to replace the current main ships weapons to it?
ooooh
KILL DA PIRATEZ
Why isn't your ship fleet called "The Vikings?" :P
Vordox but YOU are a pirate
We ARE Vikings!
Vordox: Cause vikings my good friend
Vordox: Yay for scandinavians :P
Also a reason why I don't like Halo Wars
...I'm surprised. Ireland hasn't united yet and I'm in the 1120s (started in 1066). I could potentially try to get a cassus belli there and get a beachhead. Potentially could get access to mercenaries through that. (strangely Iceland can't get any mercenaries)
killerpony7733 : you must have like the game Lost Vikings then
killerpony7733: We're a friendly bunch of peo PILLAGE AND MAIN AND MURDER- ple and we're quite passive as long as we don't get atta MURDER THE SCUMS THAT ENGAGE US-cks us.
RainBowJack: Actually never played it sadly
http://static.tumblr.com/rh7q7yc/vXxm38z8m/you-are-a-pirate-2.gif
Vordox: Yep, we were once terrifying but now we are one of the most nicest known people in the world sorta :D
killerpony7733: We're like Canadians.
We are NOT angry, just slightly.
Someone called the french canadian?
There's a reason Canada is part Vikings. :P
so does this game cost much
brb shower time.
talking about the brony community? Or pirates?
Whats the difference?
Vordox: Still the viking blood rage still lurks around in many danes and other scandinavians
We can have outburst and become savages still. :P
It's trying to retreat, Commander!
We're catching up, Engaging!
Vordox: Tell me about it,
:S
Finish it!
COME 'ERE PIRATES! We were 200 years before you became the scourge of the seas. :[
Vordox you put your faith in odin and thor we put ours in cannons and whores
They have sent retreat signals, engaging them before they take a hike, Commander Wrek. Let's bust them before they do!
alexxm: I'm more of Crom then Nordic Mythology
In today's CrimsonPhoenix daily choice, Bad-assery http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m827xufi6l1r8z5dfo1_1280.png
Dat Diana and...
Who is the other one supposed to be?
It's not Leona.
More like Rylai or Ryze.
Or Invoker
Vordox
how about
it's not a LoL crossover
just both princess being bad-ass
The weapon says otherwise.
REMEMBER ME?
the weapon is a double side
douhgn
im baaaaack
^
lol
it's been good
...?
Mega pony is out
Nice
:P
Vordox, http://derpy.me/2o1O5
Also Double sided
is this that sins of solar empire game?
No, it's Starfarer
I know of megapony
oh..
hmm
Vordox, what?
no it's not
strange i remember there being more people than this...
and the weapon is larger
in Diana's
what are you guys talking about?
:$
I posted a pic and vordox is claiming that it's a LoL crossover
GO BIG MAC!
and I deny that completely
can i see pic?
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m827xufi6l1r8z5dfo1_1280.png
it's just pure bad-assery
^
yeah
artist?
no LoL crossover or anything
yeah
"atryl" is the artist, claims inspiration came from many fantasy things
Look at dat big Mac <3
nice
lol at atryls avatar
Vordox big mac? were?
That avatar... O______0
whats this?
hello everone
It SHREDDED another one
ahh
how've you been Thrackerzod
hello Thrackerzod :)
hi Thrackerzod!
did Wrek draw anything new?
So does Vordox still say that the pic is a crossover?
what is this game called and who is playing right now?
Why am i on this stream everyday, oh wait, its aweosme
of course it is
CrimsonPhoenix: Heavy coincidence then
Thrackerzod: Starfarer played by Wrek
Epicmetalbrony: Starfarer, and wrek is playing right now
thx :)
the armor is hardly the same Vordox, you just thought of Diana cause she came out just today
and everything Luna related will make you think of her
CrimsonPhoenix: how old is Atryl's picture?
....=.=
just today but that's irrelevent
:P
That's NOT irrelevantthen
>.>
<.<
there's many luna piece that came out
Today with how Diana was recognized 1 week ago?
My coincidence theory just shambled after that fact
BRB im going to buy tacos =D
lol
did you guys see the other pic
of trixie
Vordox you just don't seem to wish to admit that you're fan-gasming over Diana
which is common with any champion coming out
CrimsonPhoenix: Are you 100% denying that Diana was not a part of the inspiration for the art?
I am
I digress
Cause not everything has to be inspired by something that just came out
Song name?
thats playing right now?
:S
00,03Mornin' y'all!

Hello Scoot-Scootaloo
00,03So is this game like Starcraft but without the RTS elements?
CrimsonPhoenix: Are you a artist by any chance?
how've you been Scoot-Scootaloo
Guess you could say that
Oh Sweet Mother of Celestia we're DOOMED... and its gonna be awesome http://derpy.me/f7f0s
Would I need to be an artist to enjoy some piece?
00,03Excited of course!
CrimsonPhoenix: I'm speaking about the abundance of artistitties Psychology
:P

Spectrum_Rush thats so awesome

Vordox: "Inspired by many fantasy things"-Atryl
In the comments
Many
fantasy
things
nothing precise
05anotehr big figh inc!
/me wants to shave head as he is tires of having linger hair
MegaMoonShine 4 hours straight?
-longer
._.
So just admit that you just thought of Diana after seeing Luna because they're on the same theme which is the Moon
i once played elder scrolls: Oblivion for a whole day
:D
gave myself a massive headache after though
pretty short game though
Not if you hunted down evry dungeon in the game
^
or joined all the guilds
Yeah i was mostly doing guild quests
spaz?
I was pretty much everything in that game. Even became a Daedric prince
really?
i didnt like oblivion
So we don't know CrimsonPhoenix :P
Ryunosuke Why?
Interesting how he hate to be wrong
I dunno,
Wrek: You don't have much of Hull Destroying?
alexxm oh yeah..
i just didnt really like it
CrimsonPhoenix: Coincidences doesn't exists to begin with =P
The shivering Isles expansion pack. At the end you Become Lord Sheagorath Daedric Prince of madness
yup
What? Then why did you bring coincidence as an argument?
CrimsonPhoenix: That's what you are saying?
and you can get amber armor
:D
No I wasn't
CrimsonPhoenix: Then what is your point against mine? O.o
I just said that the pic has absolutely nothing to do with LoL.
amber was a pain in the plot to get
Yet you can prove it so there is no doubt? =P
and it can't be a coincidence cause there's nothing in there that shows anything from LoL.
Alpha-Omega-Prime not if you cheated ;)
Alpha-Omega-Prime duplication glitch ftw
:D How could I forget that?
lol

08,01my mother owns the softest otter fur coat

What I want to point out as well is that YOU thought of Diana because of how she came out very recently and has the moon theme which is Luna's theme as well.

You just don't want to admit you're wrong.
It's nothing about that CrimsonPhoenix

Wat is going on in here??
One of my favs <3
We're partying, CrazyCherry! Come join us
i just love that song
they said bronies
/me joins MegaMoonShine.
\(^^\) |(^^)| (/^^)/
They should say bronies more often
Maybe in season 3 and 4
Boots on hooves

Partying is hard!
Spike is best Snoop dog
/me beep boop
next generation of ponys is probaly gonna be G5 and might have twilight and all the other ponys in it maybe with some diffrent animating skillz XD
Yes, because the spam is a fire hazard
^ yup
makes your house all greasy and stuff
there ight even be new voice actors in G5 after this generation
might*
or even new ponys
Maybe they'll have real ponies for G5
oh
god
no
Mr Ed?
i hope its like G4
Touche.
I kinda wanted to see Celetia dethroned
But still.
just with diffrent animation
Maybe G5 will be more like a Magical Girl anime.
It might be the CMC
8,6g5 won't happen for at least 3-5 years after g4 actually ends
Whatever Lauran Faust wanted out of G4
:o
Kandarihu, like Madoka?
Oh gosh Madoka and MLP crossover
well if lauran supports us bronies she actually might make G5 be like G4
so much want
Well, I'm downloading Pretty Cure right now.
/me beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop
All of it, tbh
o_O
spam
o.o
ALL OF THE ROBOTNESS
Beep boop son, beep boop
also G5 will be CGI
there's nothing denying that
Maybe G5 will be created by bronies instead of Hasbro? After all, bronies did create Derpy
It would be nice if it could be cel-shaded G5
Vinyl Scratch, Octavia
Tervicz they haven't
Lol, yeah. If they change Anything in the show we dont like Bronies can make episodes themselves :D
If bronies didn't notice that 'istake' would Derpy have been there?
the name in g5 might be my little pony:friendship forever
or something
Tervicz, when G4 goes downhill, we're probably going to start seeing MLP episodes made entirely by bronies.
XD
It's 9C, anyone wanna swap weather?
Tervicz: Definitely not
That's it Tervicz they didn't MAKE it they just point it out
It's either going to run for too long or be cancelled too quickly.
DoubleRainboom are making MLP episodes
Tervicz: They would've just gone "Oh, just an error"
http://i.imgur.com/tADT6.png
asdsadasasda
they did name it though
MegaMoonShine, I like how ignorant you are in there
<_<
Derpy wouldn't be what she is without the bronies. The new toys might end up being worth more than the principal of Equestria, no?
CrimsonPhoenix: What?
http://i.imgur.com/tADT6.png
look at this picture
right there
MegaMoonShine, keep in mind that this is on 4Chan. They aren't exactly known for mild reactions.
the chat sure is quiet today...
lol4chan
guys
you are aware that 4chan is basically the root of the whole fandom
right?
pretty much.
I know, i know
Ugh... I screwed up here
Shame Wakfu didn't grew up as much as MLP
Still hate it though.
I don't mind 4chan
I just don't have the feelings for sites like that.

Pinkies4thWall: Pretty much.

You need like 2Gb RAM and a decent GPU to run it 60 though
NO$GBA IMO is the best one

I'm almost done downloading Pretty Cure
Wow, those guy are stupid
Dem horns.
Buytoast: Well yeah this IS Bronystate :P
Does this mean we have our own pet troll again? :D I was so sad when the last one died.
He alerted the horde
doesn't mean i am one
THIS...IS.. BRONYSTATE!
dats Bullying :(
twilight_sprinkle: a horny blonde?
Pudge: dat germans face! *bonk*
BronyInstrumental: :D
Kammerjunk: Say what now
twilight_sprinkle: oh, totally what I was thinking
Well, the majority of us here are in fact fans of MLP, Buytoast.
lol
Buytoast: Well, tough break for you to be here then.
Oh mai
Yay
~
So, Minecraft just reeased a MASSIVE update today.
killerpony7733: I was sad when our last pet troll died.
i enjoy rthe show
released*
i hate the fandom
Marx: Yeah, it broke my client.
Kammerjunk: Oh?
Buytoast: hell of a lot better than other fandoms
oh nvm, u
no
XD
killerpony7733: He was too young to die D:
no it's not
Anyway, what are we watching?
stormtroopers?
Buytoast: compare this fandom to the sonic fandom, what's better?
Kammerjunk: :D
nearly every other
XD
even the sonic fandom is better than this one
In that case... we will love and tolerate the BUCK out of you, toast.
Not sure if trollin...or is serious
why are all of you suprised by them being called StormTroopers? its what they were called irl, the SS
well, we have a new pet troll!
Buytoast: Welcome to Bronystate! You are now our new resident troll! :D
Buytoast: It's not wise talking about that to Bronystate :P
This is so exciting.
Ha ha ha.
yup, trollers gonna troll
Malested or molested XD
Also, it's already August? Heck, my birthday is in a couple of weeks.
he was molested
I love that woman
XD
lol
Man, I wonder how new you guys are.
Marx: I'm surprised to.
dats one cool nazi
Buytoast: New to what?
/me snuggles Buytoast
If my B-Movie choice ever gets picked, I might have to consider bringing in some acquaintences in from another internet community to prepare for the backlash. Non-bronies, but hopefully not anti-bronies. I can probably count on them to be on their best behaviour.
Gotta go fast, gotta go fast!
Buytoast: We're not THAT new. :P
did the movie just start?
Adenoid Hinkle?
Eli: It's been on for a while
I've been here for 4 weeks
so i'm not THAT new
damn.. wanted to see that one for a while
Kandarihu: wat movie? or is it a surprise?
Buytoast: I think i've been here like a month after this website was made, but i was named pony_(the random number)
Buytoast: But we're mostly cuddley and happily about everything, and sure want to spread dis little insanity onwards, as long as enjoyment of it are in it in it's more geniune form of happiness and friendship
YEP
Buytoast: Eh, haters gonna hate. You don't like fandom, stay off the chat and go watch it on youtube.
i've been here for about a month now
Oh boy
I'm not new! I've been here all summer!
He can be here Meanwhile
inb4 Buytoast isnt serious
this is the most attention i've gotten ina while
Pudge: I'm a regular like many others :P'
it's making me feel all important
It's almost Paradoxic how this Movie was made while the exact same thing was going on in Germany (building "The Warmachine" etc" at the time the mvoe was made) and somehow NOBODY saw the War coming...
Buytoast is cool and all, mostly calm and consitent and thinks things through
HEIL HINKLE
twilight_sprinkle, I think it would be best to leave it as a surprise until it gets picked.
Vordox: It's more likely he's just a troll.
killerpony7733: I'm starting to feel like one
As long as he doesn't cause issues, anyone is allowed her
ded
Buytoast: That's kind of sad, though.
DEAD
well damn
i haven't caused issues in the year i've been coming here
Pudge: Trust me when you have been around enough months you start feeling like that fully,
why would i start them now?
Buytoast: Nope
Kandarihu: heh kk :P maybe a pokemovie?
Buytoast: That's why I said Meanwhile can be thoughtful of this P
thats how I play Piano.... only worse
/me lurks
hey guys
Anyone here is allowed, as long as they don't cause trouble.
wat do u guys do here
hey John :)
All that I can say is that it's... important.
:)
For a sec, I thought he was talking to the fruit.
i new
Hello John
It's great that the Nazi salute, slightly altered, is how a gay person waves hello.
Thorn3: It's a fetish.
hey,
akward
Vordox: Well sure, but it seems kinda pointless if you don't like the fandom to hang out with it.
John: We watch cool stuff and chat
WOOOOOOO
John: Read the rules and everything before joining?
:S
well it's time for me to leave for my job interview, wish me luck.
Snort.
Oh my
what
oh my
where
magik!
"No, not there!"
ZE MAGICKS
Pudge: Good luck!
That Hinkel is a Spy
Good Luck, Pudge!
hi John, We chat and watch ewhatever the Streamers throw at us
John: Theres a rules tab above the stream
i only hate about 90% of the fandom, i can deal with you people because of the entertainment
Buytoast: You by any chance, isn't the one doing "Non brony commentaries"?
:o
John: http://www.bronystate.net/rules/
Huh. He can DEAL with us.
Don't do it!
ok
That's not 25 FEET
Hey guys, who here likes My Little Dashie?
NOO
*splat*
He gonna die
I do
Braviary: Overrated story is overrated.
Herring? lol
fail
da tchaplin
Buytoast: I have to say, parts of the fandom, especially the people of 4chan, can be pretty annoying.
I CAN FLY
Meanwhile, pretend to gawk over it, is what I'm trying to get.
00,03FUNFACT: We don't take kindly to people who say they want pony episodes...
Kammerjunk: Is 4Chan not just continuously annoying though?
GilDash: Fair point.
After this let's watch a G3.6 pony episode!
Yay!
Buytoast: Are you?
/me slaps Braviary with a brick.
am i what?
Well, /g/ is fairly decent, I guess.
Yes please don't request ponies
oh god no
GilDash: Hiya didn't see you get on :D
I agree with Braviary.
Scoot-Scootaloo, G3.5 after this!
killerpony7733: Sly as always. ;)
/me prays for braviary's soul
Aaaah fml I got clementine juice in my eye
Buytoast: The "Non brony commentary" series on youtube?
I don't like Fans who try to convert everyone and try to prais the show to heavens >.<
GilDash: Or i have just played a bit too much tribes to care :D
never heard of it
Buytoast: You two would go well together. :P
Alpha-Omega-Prime: requesting ponies isn't so bad, just no G1-3 ponies
does he hate them for liking the show?
Tbh, thinking about it Buytoast you're pretty right. The majority of the fandom does suck.
killerpony7733: Well, either and or. XD
Buytoast: You will see, He's not a brony and watching MLP cause of requests from his friends
But he's not changing
I'm fine with the sea ponies though :3
Still, Sonic fandom is easily worse.
If you want to seriously request ponies, you just have to make sure you request G4.
Meanwhile: That goes without saying, though.
incorrect
if you want to request ponies
Don't
Braviary, Doesn't work that way
^
Requesting G4 ponies will get us the live show.
Braviary: nah, theyll never play g4 if you requesy for it
it's true meanwhile, but not all of it at least. the 10% that aren't terrible are still good
Kandarihu: God, no. The live show is the worst thing I have ever seen.
Even G3.6 is better.
Let's watch the live show after this!
Buytoast: Give the non brony commentary a look and see for yourself. :P
i hate commentaries on things
I hate toast. Except Powdered Toast Man.
I hate helicopters.
omg why havent i found this fic sooner ? .....i think blueblood is going into heromode .... this can only get epic
I hate vans
i don't want to listen to some jackass saying stuff when i'm watching it
Buytoast: Is there SOMETHING you don't hate?
He likes toast.
Vordox: He doesn't hate vests.
woman let him talk!
She talks way too much
Steam is pretty cool.
Asking for Pony music will get us... I don't know. I know of one song that would be like battery acid to a brony's psyche. I don't know if the mods know about it.
L4D reference
Kandarihu: which one?
Why not ask for specific songs?
Kandarihu well get the G1 Applejack song
So now he's a barber?
what is he going to do.....
Kandarihu: is it the 'yiff in hell, furfag' song?
Who's a silly pony? Who is, you is Lil_B.
I asked for the Children of the Night animatic and I got it.
he's shaving her beard?
LAWL
Meanwhile yay XD
Dat beard :D
hell, this palce is on the precipice i'd say
BronyInstrumental, it's less direct than that.
The Rain Slick Precipice of Darkness.
Buytoast: Yet you come back :P
You mean the threshhold, right, Buytoast?
i get to watch movies
Meanwhile then redness then whiteness
Brink ?
Thorn3: dat tobuscus
She shaving?
08,01who shaving?
wait, we got a non brony here?
You shaving.
Dat foolishness
Meanwhile: I love that game.
It's probably more along the lines of G3.6 in terms of maturity, but even worse. And it has no real relation to MLP.
Kammerjunk: Gotta love Penny Arcade.
Buytoast, then why do you decide to join the chat?
Eeyup.
shiny
NO
I HATE PENNY ARCADE
hell, if i were to come here to complain about the show, i'd be an even bigger asshole than usual
Braviary: What?
08,01hey guys
Penny Arcade is overrated.
Braviary: orly
It's the potato man
good evening my little bronies! :)
Penny Arcade is decent.
08,01G4 sucks

Alright. I'm done downloading Pretty Cure. Now to move this off my failing HDD, and see what I need to redownload

Ctrl+Alt+Del is just words words words words without a joke
I'm quite sure this is not terminator 2
can you spell glüknsackle?
if you guys keep talking like that i feel like the only brony actually online...
Buytoast: You mean like LIFE?!
08,01SirGanjalf: heh, i used to have one of those. i put a modern powerpc processor into it; dual core clocked at 1.8ghz. it *flew*.

She better not have missed a period..

Buytoast: Mmm
derpy_pony: yes and no, its a joke that its not

Meanwhile: ... ok continue your hate then :D

Kammerjunk: Love that bit

Kammerjunk: Very valid, infact
So emotional
Those are strange workshoes...

Look at him... tossing us around.

this movie reminds me of another Movie "Mein füherer: Die Wahrste wahrheit über Adolf Hitler" (My Leader: The most true Truth about Adolf Hitler) its a Pardoy where a Jew has to train Hitler... it's not a Comedy move, but I love how they changed the Perspective around how people look on everything

Hello makoton
Hai thar, makoton ^^
SirGanjalf no, it's a Comedy movie, but way too dark in my opinion to be a Comdey, and I just like how they portai Hitler as this innoccent person who just want to do something right andf gets used by all the others (Goebbles, Himmler, etc)
There's a long ass in this movie?
Well I'm falling asleep

My wife

08,01it's when things are packaged into neat little categories that these decisions are made. in essence, it's the comapnies that make these products that decide what should be socially acceptable for men and women to wear as a scent

SeaponiesofLiverpool: Scoot-Scootaloo wanted to stream it :)
Scoot.... marry me

Unnr|Unpacking: I'd bet that above 90% of the cost of a perfume is because of PR and marketing. I mean the chemicals and the research needed for them cost almost nothing.
The big diffrence is that antiperspirants geared to women tend to have slightly less aluminum oxide
Head&Shuolders plus Tresenme
Hallo.

I was gone for a few minutes, when I come back Mario is there?
claymation = wallace and gromit right?
on average, but that means like .1-.5%
mmmmm, head and shoulders, too bad I can't afford any
Braviary: Pretty much, yeah.
cachi01|MW3 right you are
cachi01|MW3: ^

Dken2021: speaking like yoda why are you?
So far, the only claymation Scoot-Scootaloo has streamed is Gumby and some serious creepypasta.

I MISSED A CREEPYPASTA?
didn't realize right you are was yoda speak
the tresenme is b1 vitamins for wavy or curly hair
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK

Lets all go to the lobby, lets al go to the lobby o__________o

its been internal server error 500
cant even serv htm files
08,01Chrysalis: that probably means you have a bad .htaccess or something
08,01Chrysalis: afaik, you can ssh in and look at logs
weird I closed my eyes for a lil and I felt like someone was lurking beside me o.0
08,01wait, i might be thinking of a different hosting company...
08,01but contact their support; they're generally quite good

cachi01|MW3: great mighty poo, POORN? i dunno what are you talking about :(
its also really annoying theres no ftp access
Chrysalis: if it isn't being held together at the seams by a poorly written bash script, it isn't a proper jury-rig
08,01Chrysalis: seriously? how do you transfer files?
watch out, he can throw an ocean
Am I really the only one looking forward to the start of school?

Or rather, how.
TACTICAL SPEACH INCOMING!!! LISTENING TO IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA
this THE moment?
StinkomanFan: By accident, yes.
maybe it will evolve in a billion years XD
Ah, I see how this speech works into the movie. Quite the twist.
HERE IT COMES
Pfft.
THE PART YOU'VE ALL HEARD A HUNDRED TIMES BUT NEVER GETS OLD
LMAO
not the first guy speech though, that guy needs to be shot
Braviary: Especially because it's still mostly valid today.

wat
An aesop that will stand the test of time
it's sad really how many people disliked this film back then when it first came out in his time.
Can we watch the TF2 version when the movie ends?
What were you watching?.......i'm back
hy was charlie not elected president after this?
Braviary: That one is really well made.
SeaponiesofLiverpool, he wasn't running
Dark92Enigma: hai, the great dictator
write-in candidate
SeaponiesofLiverpool well. hes a good speaker but did he write this speach?
how've you been Dark92Enigma
Michael what's it about?
Hai Dark92Enigma :)
hi Dark92Enigma
alexxm fine, as always, but i feel a cramp in my right arm
Yeah!
He wrote produced and directed this movie
Dark92Enigma i heard booker t's smackdowns general manager now
this is the type of speech we need today
^
^^
Michael not the one with ''Mah Fuhrer! I'm WALKING!?
^^^^
^^^^^
Dark92Enigma: i dunno
alexxm SO i heard
my ideals in a nutshell
Dark92Enigma do you think he'll be good at it
MEDIC IS HERO
why can we never elect a good leader.... we know what the perfect leader is through movies like this
/me Applauses
alexxm Better than AJ as GM of course
HATE AND INTOLERANCE?
I hope I'm not the only one who spoke along there.
/me cheers
bai everypony, time to go unpack books!~
Do away with hate and intolerance!
HATE AND INTOLERANCE = ANTIBRONIES
bye Unnr|Unpacking
why can we never elect a good leader.... we know what the perfect leader is through movies like this
cachi01|MW3: Basically, Chaplin would've made a great brony.
bye UncouthLurker
Bai Unnr|Unpacking :)
bye Unnr|Unpacking
i mean the speech
bye Unnr|Unpacking!
Seriously, I'm not the only one who spoke along, right?
Have fun, Unnr|Unpacking!
Kammerjunk: nope
That was beautiful... :'(
Oh.
bye Unnr|Unpacking
Suddenly, this looks like Wizard of Oz
:3 it actually delayed me leaving
:'(
>_>
cachi01|MW3, we bronies are just as capable of evil as the anti-bronies are as well. We musn't be prideful.
Kammerjunk: I'm more of a listener to this speech
bye Unnr|Unpacking
Kandarihu: i know but im surprised when he said hate and intolerance cause actually thats the opposite of ouor motto
killerpony7733: It is inspirational.
He said look up!
love and tolerate
look up! its RainbowDash
our
Sonic Rainboom
Would Rainbow Dash work in a grayscale world?
Tolerance I can accept, but I don't feel like I have to love every bloke.
she'd sonic rainboom it
like what happened to Pinkie
/me violins
:;(
:'(
Braviary: think of Daring Do's Mane
11/10
/me claps
Amazing speech/10
/me applauds
Encore!
I wonder what'd happen if Dashie did a Sonic Rainboom while Discorded.
/me Now how, she would get sad again.............ooooooooh. When she saw that Rainboom there
Awesome movie
I rate this moustache/10.
medic!!
Not bad as I was only awake to finish the movie
MEDIC IS HERO
SPEECH/10
TF2 version
lol MEDIC XD
This one is very well made.
TF2 makes everything cooler
makes me question... when did this movie come to germany?
Kandarihu: Goodness, no. They're not mutually inclusive.
this is horrible.... TF2 doesn't fit
I find the TF2 version more touching. The music and the imagery
It's not that bad
epic
going to bed now
the music adds a nice touch tough
*though
movie version is 20% better
Kandarihu I'm all for fighting for one wants, and than doesn't involve hatred
And to think this is from the guy who does stuff like Skype Molments.
Gnight Alpha-Omega-Prime sleep well
We can argue but it won't matter. The message remains the same
/me <----- And add French Fries with that order
Violence, war, WMDs, all of these are last resorts at one stage of another.
You are not kettle.
Unless its a preemptove strike :D
Did the movie show what happened to Hinkle?
StinkomanFan i think he died
alexxm, I hope so
WHAT ABOUT BOOMER!?
For some reason, this speech puts an idea of a Equestria where the Changelings had invaded, and Chrysalis did this speech.
Being willing to fight, even kill if one has no choice, doesn't entail a love of war or all of the vices that make war a reality.
My mind is strange.
brb
gah, stupid bandwidth
puts into my head*
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp8DrWzAAcE Play this version
its the pony version
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES
I love this song... Somehow its really inspirering to me

LOOKIT LOOKIT LOOKIT!!!!!!!!!! <3
Kandarihu: a hitman can kill anyone without a shred of hatred.
WOO WOO WOO
/me noms on Scoot-Scootaloo
Kandarihu: I'm willing to fight for what I believe, but that doesn't mean I hate the opposition.

hi AJTheMightyGamer!
Heya AJTheMightyGamer
:D
AJTheMightyGamer, I don't
OH CRAP THAT'S TODAY?
Hi AJTheMightyGamer!
But it giga D:
hai AJTheMightyGamer
CrimsonPhoenix: but why
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CI-0E_jses&feature=related we had to play this in jazz band... Im not even in jazz band
I despise Rina-Chan
CCCP cool
I'm scared of Reina
oh, well you are entitled to your opninion
Bronystate Bane-of-sleep
D:
Spitfireisbestpony Is it really? ITs reather warm outside here
It is Giga that is doing it right?
so who here like bananas? : D http://derpiboo.ru/64237
or so i heard
I hate how she's everywhere in everything
CCCP :D
:3
and I hate how people rely on her to contribute on their projects
Spectrum_Rush: dat celestia :D
brb
I hate how it's Newgrounds all over again
CCCP wow... I only ever heard this on Parodius XD
CrimsonPhoenix: Funny you should say that because I've never really heard of her.
Trollstia
THERE ARE WAY MORE PEOPLE THAT CAN VOICEACT IN THIS COMMUNITY
Meanwhile, youshould explore some more
BASS CANNON http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYGioWinQQE&list=FLaKCn8LyYp3lQWFAHcm9znA&feature=mh_lolz
Lil_B you did?
CrimsonPhoenix: Or perhaps I'm just not exploring in the right direction.
http://derpiboo.ru/59157 cute luna :)
and there are even some people that can do a better twilight than her
CCCP yes, Stage one in one of the Parodius Version for the SNES
anypony ever seen party.MOV
Meanwhile: http://i.imgur.com/d9qVS.gif i cant wait for when it starts
Lil_B wow
Spitfireisbestpony: everypony has seen the pony.movs
Meanwhile, she's in .mov she's in Fighting is Magic as Mayor Mare she's in My little Portal
cachi01: Don't say that in here. You'll wake up the mods...
CCCP go too 1:20 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1jl6OUavQ
she's in a short animation of twilight being teleported everywhere
Kawaii_icybeauti: xd
and that's only a fraction
CrimsonPhoenix: Ah, well, now I know why I haven't heard of her. Because I don't care about any of those.
Lil_B HOLY SHIET
TURN IT OFF! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vUJps6FSTc&list=FLaKCn8LyYp3lQWFAHcm9znA&index=11&feature=plpp_video
CCCP Parodius has some epic music XD
my favorite of ther .MOVs is SHED.MOV
she also made Colgatelicious which became ridiculously popular because of her undeserfve popularity
Lil_B i want that game
worst of all
she has no voice range
.MOVS are meh..
Shed is best mov. After that, it's either party or magic
CCCP its weird as hell, but fun
all of her voice are similar
i'll agree with Crim on that
YES
rina chan was on those naruto parodies right?
SOMEONE AGREES WITH ME
90's European Video game music.. its so damn more 90's than any other Video Game music XD http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdY4EKAcW4Q
cachi01, I don't know
Lil_B it looks awesome, i hope i can get it on an emulator... to lazy to buy an SNES
i agree even tho idk wat we talkin bout lol
considering how weeaboo she is possibly
you guys see in the cutie pox episode
CCCP I emulate them too, I have no SNES and Parosious wasn't even released in the US (or at least most of them weren't)
is the stream over?
http://derpiboo.ru/45456

CrimsonPhoenix: if you explained it in this session you can just press up to access your old messages
DAMN
MaxTheBrony: dont worry, its not you at all.
She somehow got popular with such a low voicerange and she's invading every fan-project because of how her voice is similar to Twilight Sparkle.

ThePretender: you fanboy you
Scoot-Scootaloo: skype?
CrimsonPhoenix: allright, we know you dont like her becasue her talent isnt on par with tabitha st germain, you may consider shutting up about it now. it gets kinda nnoying

How to draw a pony.
"New", yeah
Obsidian: Agreed.

Spirito~
funfact
Draw a pony.
The end.
Animatics <3
DISCORD IS EVIL CAUSE HE WANTS
Aaah, I never knew it was that easy
:(
THERE IS NO REASON
THE END
Where is his beard :D? does he even have a beard
Is this from Hunchback of Notredum?
Meanwhile well i draw when i fon't have anything else to do /can't find what to do
00,10says who cachi01?
Shooeie: indeed

dat discord
the girl doing that is working at Children of the night currently
D'awww
i can't handle free time
I do know my Disney
I think being chaos, he feels no love, that's what I think is fun
Suddenly somepony? How did the voice get edited like that?
Oh its young discord
:D
Sumica: uhmmmm The great and powerful thisisnotreal? :I
Shooeie: Its a remake from HOND
Kandarihu: he probably sung it himself
Young Discord is awesome
I probably missed rina-chan did I?
These guys need a pro inbetweener to do the tweening
eeyup
Dken2021: yup.
Dken2021: Yup
Yup
00,10it's just as real as he's evil because he is.

I can hear this forever :)
http://derpiboo.ru/40009
no need to be patient to draw as far as i know Jim
so calm :)
This video and the previous one are by the same person
Haven't heard this yet
WHO SINGS THIS?
Fisheh_Fish: its from Hocus Pokus
though I've been meaning to
CrimsonPhoenix: It felt like it
well this one is by two people
Well, I attempted drawing once
and Kate is the singer
00,10the colord still for this look amazing
I sat for 10 hours just doodling
why internet? why must you crap on me today? :(
Eeeehhhh...to pick up my sketchpad or to not...that is the question.
suddenly the day was gone
This looks pretty good- but the song just doesn't do it for me
This is really so beautiful. ._.
Well, whatever, need tea now.
the singer http://www.youtube.com/user/katethegreat19
Creepy
dat voice crac~
really like the animation though
I grow weary of this...
Vivix: a complete animation for it is also in the works
i dont see it as being creepy, i like it ^_^
Back on my laptop.
Demiurge: never
Nice, I love traditional approach
flash crashed :/
00,10how dose one grow a weary? how much water dose it need?
flash can be done well, but it's often...too odd
that ryhmes
00,10does it prefer shade or sun?
flash crashed :D
Hey guys!
Can;t wait for the full animation of this
Umm.... 2 cups?
i wonder what happens to those kids
Vivix: well, it will be flash xD
Oh my god I was watching this earlier
Sumica: about a horse's whinny worth.
Hello Emmie
Beautiful :3
ello Emmie
Demiurge, get used to it, when it'll be done it'll probably get stream a few more time
well, flash but not flash tween character rig, rather drawn
hiya Emmie
hai Emmie
like seriously
probably
what happens to them
Is Children of the Night going to be JUST this or longer?
oh little children foolish you are
MrPipin, they explain
this is only an animatic
Now that I think about it, it's actually quite good :P
now you shall stay with me forever
oooooooh ooooooooh
Emmie: They are working on a full animation
But yeah, I didn't like the song
CrimsonPhoenix: explain where ?
Obsidian: A full episode?
they didn't need to put the fillies and colt cause they knew it would be there
It evoked much pathos in me
pathos.... Greek?
rawr
but they are there, floating with Luna
Pathos- Emotion
Emmie: Sadly no just the music vid.
Robocop 3 just doesnt make much sense.
Tiem for Robocop 3 in the middle of class! Woo!
I know... I'm Greek :P
Shooeie: sure it does!
/me hands out popcorn and candy to the chat
Obsidian: Oh, that's what I figured :P

Shooeie: it's the final culmination of OCP's plans
suddenly CG
dat old CGI
Imagine all the people~
monoraaaaaail
DOWN IN FRONT!
BECAUSE IT IS
Imagine: a utopia that is completely impossible to attain
MrPipin: an animatic is what the animators get to know what goes where and when during the animation process

DocSane: want a taco?
I'm here to see......what's said to be the worst Robocop movie

the problem with movies like these is that they force their moral so hard it gets a bit annoying-
Dark92Enigma: it is mostly but it has it's good parts
cachi01: No, I ate already. And how would I get this taco you speak of?

Continuity error much?

ponyfromPR: Good

He had NO prime directives at the end of 2

11,01Dat directive four.
All his directives were wiped in the last movie, right?
00,10noob tube
I tought they removed that
He can't
dat noob tube
11,01I thought he deleted them all?
that is indirect
Kind of disapointed there was no Hellfire remix at all in that world
He did.
11,01In Robocop 2.
aww they died D:
Nittany_Discord: Primes were on backup
He deleted his directives at the end of the second movie. >_>
PLOT HOLE
dat spas12
Nittany_Discord: the primes stay, basis of system and all that.
Yeah, I don't think the makers of this movie are aware of that.
This movie's already operating on a false premise.
how did he take a grenade to the chest and still function?
poppin smoke
CriticKitten: he deleted those bullshit ones
this movie is amazeing
You know, why does Robocop get his ass handed to him in the first act.
PaladinDrakkenwolf: cause he is batman
CriticKitten, that's an understatement
otakon: No, he deleted *all* of them.
If RoboCop shot them then and there it would've ended to fast Nittany_Discord
CriticKitten: no he rebooted
PaladinDrakkenwolf: i mean robocop
well if robocop shot them imagine the fallout
CriticKitten: primes were in local backup
otakon: The movie indicates that he deleted every directive from his memory.
police vs second police?
otakon: Including the primary ones.
....
CriticKitten: they reinstalled them then
am i the only one seing ponies on the screen ._>
the prime's I mean
they must have reinstalled the directives
00,10they probably put them back in when they gave him upgrades
otakon: Or maybe the writers of this movie are making shit up.
you dumbass why did you NOT wear your vest?
Both are equally likely. >_>
His electrocuting himself wiped out all of his directives.
11,01Should have chosen your words carefully girl.
Now sacrifice the blood of a virgin to bring her bck to life.

He said ARE YOU OKAY?
Titanic always makes me cry...
00,10he got lighter
Spectrum_Rush: for UP why?
wow hes not heavy?
PinkiePieYoshi64: also that scene with draco stepping out of the rain. that was one hell of cgi for back then
Sumica: they replaced parts
lol
Took like six cops to lift him in the last movie
0,14missed what now?
Oo Titanic was good
the last thing that rellay made me cry :/ ... good question
So that is why he took so much damage
smart girl!
Who has a Repair skill of 75 and two scrap metals?
well THAT was easy
maybe?
Now I feel like shit for not feeling during Up. I hate my misplaced feels.
SHUT UP COACH WESLEY
00,10yup

Oh, right
cachi01: She's gotta get her GW2 fix
Suitcase mind
CriticKitten: he took critical damage from it, he needs major repairs from that. IN the fight with Kane he was thrown off a building, shot at with a smart gun, smashed through a brick wall AND nearly wielded. He was walking around fine after that

Hello everypony

I've never seen the other robocop movies

but it just felt a bit juvenile and contrived in its moral lessons
spartan133t: we r watching star wars III
Then I wont be here for the RiffTrax. :(
Hey Shizuka when will you show the Rifftrax version? Tonight or tomorrow?
why moar starwars!?
What is the rifftraxed version?
My mom wants to watch this, and I'm gonna catch it big time if it's the Rifftrax next.
Spartan Because it's trilogy event summer week
Shizuka: well, watching it twice in a row is probably not very fun
CREDITS NUUU
spartan133t: DICK FIGURES FTW
Shizuka: I'm inclined to say tomorrow.

I never watched Tron Legacy so I never understood most of the story in the level

MORE RAILINGS! THE STAR WARS MOVIES LACK OF THEM
The inclusion of TWEWY characters seems kind of random
pikie is defying gravity
Though Pinkie Pie doesn't need them
0,14>round of cider slide
Its so hard to stay awake without pizza in my stomach.
0,14>just finished my beer

13so fun story behind why i finally decided on cider... i realized i'd pretty much only been using twi through the whole intermission and needed to fit the others in... but i was out of slides
i've managed to miss every star wars screening on every night :D
actual cider, mind you
Also I never played TWEWY so I had NO IDEA who most of the characters were
13so i just went and found the cider pic
SaxyPretender, no you have to have cider
13bias eliminated!
DINKY
SaxyPretender, Gonna be a drunk night then
0,14guess so

SpadeMagnes[R]: The inclusion of characters from other Square Enix games has exsisted in KH games from the begining so its no surprise to me
13you're slacking behind saxy
Well, i've been on almost every Star Wars screenplay.........
