I thought about sending him a reaction pic.
Same, I haven't told a soul offline.
he absolutely hated ponys.

Idk why.
he won't talk about them.
I think he's in denial.
Maybe he got trolled with ponies?
Have you read the Elements of Gaming fanfic?

you ARE funny.
you kicked me while I was eating :(
yup.
what number is it?
still going.
It's to low of a volume for me to hear
XD
he counts soooooo slow....
The highest I ever counted was 1001
I wanted to go to 1000, but then I thought. "eh, fuck it."
How does the video end?
I seriously doubt that.
nope.avi
I remember the end.
:P
nope.aj
ok...
you told me it was like 2000
:P
what's the name of the video?
What is infinity? Some say it's the endless number, but in my case, infinity was my level patience. I was able to count to 1999 before I called it quits, so 2000 was my "infinity". If you're not sure what I mean, try counting to infinity for yourself and see how far you get. It's tougher than it sounds. Just don't make a video about it, please! I wasted way too much of other people's time with this video, lol
ohmygod.
aha.
boooo.
that guy sucks.
so basically, he pussed out.
lol.
is what you're saying.
maybe I will.
easy
Probably I won't.
infinity is a concept, not a number.
infinity isn't a number.
^
It can't be counted to, It doesn't work.
so... here we go...
0
Nope
∞
I did it.
:P
I counted to infinity.
IT CAN'T BE DONE, i TELL YOU
I'll do it again for the record.
0
∞
:P
baaaah
If you put a number on infinity then you just cant imagine endlessness.
hey dari
Which is not a sign of intelligence.
http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_li7p39TkII1qafrh6.jpg
:P
Infinity means endless, without finite.
it's not something that can change from person to person
lol.

With his fancy accent and whatnot
it's not fancy where he comes from, everyone has it.
Yeah, I'm wearing a monocle.
Classy.
To be honest accents are really variable here.
Almost as classy as Gummy's Classy Cola
You'll only be classy when you have a shoe on your head.
They all sound the same to me, I'm not going to lie.
:P
There are tons of different accents just in England alone.
>implying I don't always wear a shoe on my head.

Have you ever met a mexican person with a mixture of a mexican and a british accent?

That doesn't seem like it's a weird thing

It's not.
W-well...
Still D:
You racist?
Probably, yes.
I'm not.
You get so many different races and cultures here.
I'm being honest.
I'm not racist.
I hate racism. :/
^
I race hatism.
I apologize
I get it from my mom.
I'm only racist when It makes for a good joke. which is less often then I thought it would be.
My friends know not to be racist around me because It'll really piss me off.
She's all "negro" this and "black" that.
It drills into your head.
Saying "black" isn't racist.
Which just about all young people seem to be here. >_>
The idea that one person is better than anothr purely based on skin is rediculous. I don't judge based on appearance at all. It really is what's inside that counts.
Precisely
Love and toleration for everyone~
Most people judge past skin colour, as more of a cultural tihng
Except the japanese >.>

Not wearing shoes actually does help though.

Yeah, it allows for movement so much better.

Hi there.

This is the third night in a row that I can't sleep.
OHHH shit
I dunno what that means but cool
lol
uuumm, you wanna play games!
seems legit
But I haven't been!
D:
It's because Rainbow Dash is 20% cooler... So they get a star.
they were just saying you were innactive xD
same here actually
10it means teal :D
maybe it's cuz you're mind wont shoosh
10It means I'm a mod. Or half-op to be technical
I'm going to make a background for my cousin
I'll still be logged in
you opened half the post or you are half the opening poster?
D:
Make it shoosh, plz!
hmmm
/me puts a lock on your mind
aaaaannnd silence.
what about the comic con poster
hm?
that sounds much less gorey.
get an extra comfy pillow and blanket aaannnd get rid of all of the lights
(someone say something)
Good idea.
>:D
:O D:
c: it's otay, i wanna stay up anyway.
:<
/me gives Skah her blanket too
It's less fun when people are okay with it!
XD
/me steals everything bk
/me snuggles into bed with the pillows and blankets anyways.
D:
/me cries.
x)
give me ice cream and i let u have everything bk :)
*Breaths in* Yayyyyyyy.
I have... chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream. :O
Is that good?
:O
that sounds yuummmmy!
CLOSE ENOUGH
It's fabulous.
\o/
/me gives Skah blankies and pillows back
xD
Back!
Wb. :D
:D
And hungry as hell, for that matter >.>
eat something?
hunger is a problem easily solved.
I know
well, not world hunger.
But I don't feeeeeeeeeeeeeeelllllllllll like it
Welp. gunna have to eat your own arm.
only option left.
-nom nom nom-
meh
The weird part is I just sucked on my arm to see if it tasted good.
I think I am gonna go sleep O:
The weirder part is that it did.
I'm getting really tired
Wrists.
Are
delish'
kk :), nini <3
thanks for getting on with me!
I am now sucking on my wrist.
You really shouldn't give me ideas.
Hm, got permission from Arti to set up a PO server
You know what's fun? murder is fun.
:D
and baking cupcakes.
I've actually thought out elaborate plans for murdering people.
if only there was someway to combine them.....
Same here.
Even my closest friends, which is weird.
"Hey Megan?" "Yeah?" "You know what period Shannon has gym?" "LOLWUT?"
I have dozens of spots picked out to bury bodies.
I'd disassemble them.
Then I would make pie.
Lol, kidding.
Harder then you would tihnk.
I'm no cannibal.
seven feet down, nothing can find it.
hide the hole in a forest, and it's hard to fine the tampered soil.
it
But still I'd disassemble them, drive to my aunt's two away, and hide them in their dog house.
In which they never look at
there's a shed half a mile into a forest by the church i used to go to, it's perfect if i didn't want to bury them.
Plan - Mariah's death.
other then the fact that it's probably haunted, it works.
Reason: Mariah is sitting there chatting up a storm with this girl
I know someone name mariah...
That I may or may not consider beautiful
Reason 2: She is super rude and obnoxious
My reasons are asually not very well thought out.
Plan: Wear gloves to school oneday during the winter
changes from time to time
hm, winter is a bad time for murder.
Be careful not to touch the palm area whilst putting them on
snow leaves tracks, buried bodies don't start decomposing untill later
Trip girl down the huge stairwell with either boot or hands.
cold makes all outdoor work harder
Be sure girl is around her clique.
make it look like an accident?
Main suspects: Frenemies and other drama queens.
not much fun, but it works
Exactly.
They're always huddled so close together.
One could easily trip the other.
also, you can't be around other murders
Wait a second.
if you become even a suspect in another murder
after "accidently
"
killing someone else
Why am I talking about murdering someone with a complete stranger over the internet at six in the morning?
then you're guilty
Because it's fun :P
better then telling someone you know.
Indeed
then they'd get worried.
Rule #1: Never trust anybody
I love the idea of murder
it's interesting
They'll sell you down the river.
also suicide an cannibalism, and torture.
12Yay
but anyway, murder.
hm, they check the branch in accidents
Be sure to pick up the remnants of the shooting
they still might be able to check
True
needs to be a really weak branch,
If you tried hard enough, it might work.
a perfect shot,
bbl, remind me to set it up
actually
too much work and luck
if the wind was goign the wrong way, it might not work
better to be on the tree and break it manually
What was an elaborate plan you thought of?
not that eaborate. just the basics.
chop off limbs, using toold in my house
Hm.
put into a few trash bags
To put where?
carry/drive to the forest by the my old church
and bury seven feet uner a few miles into the woods
might take all night
Seven foot whole takes a lot of work.
but seven feet means nothing gets there but bugs
*hole
ha
haha
Another plan.
Keep disassembled body parts in large hamster food bag
that would take awhile...
Hmm...
have any dogs?
Off the top of my head
No, I do not.
hamsters don't eat much
Dogs do.
having any DNA evidence around is risky shit
Exactly.
That's why cannibalism is ideal.
But, humans might not be tasty
indeed, then what about the bones and other inedibals?
So feed something else
Yeah
if you cook them right, you can stand it
unless the fact that it is human bothers you
Orrr give the dog the bone to chew on
I got an idea
Break and enter into someone's house
skulls aren't exactly socially acceptble in that sense
yes?
There's a lady down the driveway
her gate is usually locked
I can climb it, though
One day, while she's out
If there isn't any DNA evidence on the body
I could hide it somewhere in her home
Somewhere she'd never, ever look.
bones themselves can still be identified.
That's true
and if you're goign to hide them in somes elses house, make sure it's far
But if they aren't found in the first place...?
if it ever gets found, they ask all the neghbors
Yeah, you are right
I KNOW
if you can hide them that well, great.
but it would be easier to jsut bury it then
I have a gigantic chocolate bunny from easter.
He's hollow.
D:
Take a bit off his ears, put a few hands in, put ears back on.
Re-tape package.
What do you think?
and then what, keep it around?
Then dispose of it.
Put it in the trash.
Better to throw it away. It's more effiant then you would tihnk to just trash dead people
yeah
That'll get rid of some of the parts.
they don't keep records of whose trashe is whose, and the don't search it
in small piesces, it's easy
Or wrap the body up in a rug and throw it off a bridge :P
(sorry about my spelling, btw. I can't see my keyboard)
It's okay.
dead bodies float.
Cinderblocks are the only answer!
needs weights
and need to be deep as hell.
but it could work.
Could drive cross-state to Lake Erie
not bad
I live in Philadelphia
@murderousmeter Books
6 Books is 24% murderous. (285)
D:
That's wrong, anyways.
Still, I found someone with my own interest ;u;
Hell yeah
Murder is interesting.
and so are ponies.
Murder IS interesting.
who would ahve though two people thought both were interesting?
and then met in a chatroom
about ponies
BAM!
and starting talking about murder
Instafriendship.
hell yeah.
Friendship really is magic.
Indeed!
Say, do you have a YouTube account?
Or some other form of contact/
I just made in a few hours ago.
I'd love to talk some more ^^
I have a google+, I'm on that more
YES
and my google+ is for brony stuff soley
I got a job!
I hate meeting interesting people and only getting to talk for one day.
(because my family doesn't know I love ponies)
Indeed.
Say. maybe if we both like murder, we might have other things in common too!
congratulations
and bbl
I just got an e-mail from the company I interviewed with asking if they want the job they offered.
Of course! I'd hope so
here, before the internet cuts out.
Hmmm...
http://www.youtube.com/user/Obscurepopculture?feature=mhee
My invitation has been sent.
and jsut so I asked, did you want a google+?
Would you consider yourself somewhat of an artist?
Oh no, thank you
Not in the since of drawing or painting or anything, no.
sadly.
so you don't want an invite? alright.
mmmmmmmkay.
I mostly do writing, as far as art goes
Weird.
I love writing
In fact, remember that game I told you about earlier?
"Transformice"
yes?
I played it for aminute and failed. I tihnk
I'm up to Chapter Five on my fanfiction of it
Thanks!
Working on chapter six
lol nice
I never did a fanfiction for anything, I'd like to sometime.
lol nice indeed mate
Yeah
It's fun to see where your mind can wonder
Every nook and cranny, there's a new adventure.
So, before I become too comfortable talking with you, where do you live?
And better yet, you don't even need to come up with personalities!
(to make sure we don't know eachother irl)
Philadelphia.
NE Philadelphia
alright, cool. I don't know anyone there.
I'm in michigan
My real name is Emily
Ah.
lol I saw that from your youtube
Is it nice there
I'm Ben.
(I don't really like that name though)
:/
D'aw
It's... alright. Either too hot or too cold all the time
I always had a place for Ben deep in my heart ^^
but I never lived anywhere else, so I don't know much about other weathers
Oh, I see.
Me either.
lol that's not a weird thing to say..?
All I know is South = hot.
and north is cold.
I've only been to Florida, and it is sweltering.
just look at canada
Here in Philly, we're having a heatwave.
it's usually cold up here, if it were either way
So is the rest of the country
bleh, I hate summer.
Winter = 0-10 in extremes, 20 - 50 normally.
Spring = 50 - 70 average.
Summer = 90-110 in extremes, 70 - 90 avg.
Fall is about the same as Spring.
Now you know the weather in Pennsylvania :D
sounds about right.
not that different
i tihnk
so what's your favorite season?
I like Spring alot
The jittery feeling of just getting out of school
I prefer fall
The billions of contests and raffles just before a three-month dismissal
I actually never went to school.
The weather that's just chilly enough.
I've been homeschooled my entire life
Is it nice?
I think so, yeah
I've always wanted to be homeschooled.
It depends a lot on the parents
i know some homeschooled kids who are total idoits
or socially inept
The only downside is that you don't meet other people and that I would think you don't have any end of year contests.
or just jerks
Because we all know who would win.
Hm.
I have heard that homeschoolers are uncivilized.
Actually there are a lot of homeschool programs throughout the hear
A lot fo them are, don't get me wrong
it's not "Better" or "worse"
it's very variable.
Yeah
Like real school
*public school.
I tihnk, for me, homeschooling was perfect
3/4 are idiots, the others can actually spell.
more then a little bias, though
eh, a but harshe
I can be a bit of a grammar nazi at times.
You mispelled a lot
you said alot
just thought you should know,
if you're a grammar nazi
:)
:)
Thank you for correcting me
Anyway, I agree, the english language is one of the things I care all too much about
*me.
I got obsessed when I was younger, I would look up any word I didn't know the definition too
.
lol
:)
Same
I challenge you to a game a scrabble, at some point.
I am constantly using a thesarus, god knows why.
Fun stuff.
Fun stuff indeed.
Could you say you have a favorite meme?
I really can't
Waffles?
They all make me gigle
*giggle
Don't you mean Carrots??
If MLP:FiM is considered a meme, then it is my favorite.
No no no...
MLP is a LIFESTYLE
Oh yeah
since I found it, I've been so much happier.
Silly me.
I know.
I am smiling tenfold more
And tending to eat more apples.
I laugh for no reason in public
me too,
*Me too.
I am honestly worried my parents will think I am doing drugs
I make so many typos >.>
I am just so much happier since I started watching MLP
(I won't correct you, I;m making tons as well)
See?
What was the first instance of pony you've ever seen?
Mine was on the television, the end of Fall Weather Friends.
My best friends quoted in around me
I had no idea what it was
Good thing they brought you in
The herd is a magical place.
I asked, he told me, I was baffled, I wactched, and happiness unsued.
Actually, he isn't much of a Brony
I mean, he's my age and likes the show
I converted two friends so far.
Have tuba, will travel!
but he watched it from his younger sister, and doesn't do anything online about it
:o
My cousin, the one in which I made the background for, love love LOVES Gummy.
I don't know if it counts if he doesn't do anytihng Pony-esc online
/me waves at Cat and where
fuck yeah gummy
trying to murder ponies since season 1
lawl
sup?
In the tub with Twilight
AAAAAAAAWWWWWWWW YEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAHHH
Hi ^-^, nuffin
:D
like a muffin
How long have you been a brony?
I don't know why I said that
...
mew
(brony being used in a gender-neutural way)
I constantly find myself saying that.
cuz muffins are good?
I honestly cannot remember.
maybe!
muffins are pretty good
May, I believe?
nice.
I just had poached egg and fried potatoes
The only episode I've seen live is the finale.
what is a poached egg?
That is soon to change.
i like fried potaterz
<..< is poached sunny side up?
Honestly, I just got into last month, I only watched all the eps 2-3 times
where you break the egg into boiling water
I never watcched any live or near-live
it's a bit like a much healthier fried egg
Mmm
Even repeats?
:O
I'm the youngest in my house, I'm 16 years old.
interesting
I don't get to watch MLP on the tv
i think i'll try that
Usually on at 8:30, 1:30, and 6:30
8 and 1 are the same episodes.
look it up or something
they're quite nice
none of those times work, but that's fine. I have it all on my computer.
:D
Have you ever been insulted by anyone the second the theme song hits your ear?
OH! Do you know a way to download s1?
What do you mean? (first question)
06xD
TV: My little pony~
06thats not something you see everyday
Not legally, but I have my ways. (it's all free on youtrube, so maybe it is legal)
Mocking male friend: Ha! MLP?
i did :P, i'll try it for breakfast... when everyone is awake.
Like I said, I never watched it on the tv
only on my laptop
after everyone else is asleep
Well, has anyone ever heard the theme?
and no one is around to hear it
Oh.
Nope, headphones
I'm careful.
What
Do you think you'll ever come out of Equestria and admit it?
If asked, yes.
hooray
I don't even know what time it is where you are :P
My parents know, they're slightly weirded out, but don't care.
I'm gonna guess at like 6am
and to my friends that have seen some of the show through younger sisters, yes
probably.
close :P
5:22am
Hm
I even hinted to one of my friends, he didn't drill into it too much
Heh
I'm not hiding the fact that I like the show.
If someone asks what shows you like, will you gladly list it?
parents wont be up for another hour or so
Yeah
My friends love ponies
No, not if it left vague
lcuky you, I wish my friends knew
I'm hoping to convert some younger sisters of girls I know.
All you have to do is ask
"when does the narwal sparkle?"
Before: You watch my little pony? -shows a bit of ticket master- This looks pretty gay. After: Rainbow Dash is my favorite pony.
sorry, ask what again?
Ask your friends
To watcch
*watch
an episode.
No no, start with another episode
And all of your dreams will come true.
Exactly.
ticket master can come off as too girly
Ticket Master gave a rough start
maybe start with bridle gossip
It was the best one on demand at the time;
swarm of the century
Sonic Rainboom could do the trick
your parents get up before 7?
I woke up at 9am today
I would advise Dragonshy, but the way she defeats the dragon can come off as to feminine.
indeed, shows some good humour at the begining, and looks badass later
and dragonshy isn't something i would recomend
at first, but it's up there.
Party of One was great, it converted said friend, but it works best after knowing Pinkie's character.
after they see one/two
yeah, for work :p
swarm of the century shows her at her best
after that party of one
I know, right!
mom has to be at work by 8 idk about dad
I need to write this down...
Pilots - Definitely necessary.
However, they may come off as a tad weird at first
both my parents are not at work today
But way to girly and seem weird
Some shows, it's best you watch the pilot afterwards.
a bad place to start to the skeptic brony
Ticket Master- No way, no how.
1. Shows Applejack as a stereotypical hillbilly.
I'd say wait to watch ticket master until just before best night ever
2. Scraping the bottom of the barrel
Wait, art of the dress in between
:o wai?
(Two tickets, who to pick?)
That's so OLD.
indeed
not original
4. Applebuck season
Revolves around TREES.
>.>
crack jokes about drunk AJ during ep
dunno
so it seems more casual
I don't even like this episode too much, and I'm a brony
However
dad has been working on the roof, mum has been helping somewhat
which one?
Alcohol jokes will coax them though.
also I think they're taking my grandparents to the airport to go back to spain later
I dunno.
This is a maybe
ooooo, spain
Griffon the Brush-Off
I never watched the show with someone else irl
avoid that one
This episode introduces other species
annoying characters area a bad thing to enter with
maybe avodide trixie,
and also CMC
Which may seem less like MLP and more like MLG (My Little Griffon)
for early episodes
I'd watch that show/
They need to ease into the horse envirronents
windter wrap-up
Trixie may come off as a recurring character in Boast Busters.
yeah, that's where they live
We don't want that.
a good episode, if the veiwer can stand the singing
Besides, little Pinkie + Fluttershy
What was seven, again?
dragonshy?
Oh yes!
Like said earlier, dragon defeating method may come off as girly.
shweetness
but otherwise, it itruduces all the charctrs
But fainting goats and A-Team references are pure gold.
and what they do
etc
Precisely
A good reccomendation.
ohmy god my spelling is god-awful
anywa
Look Before You Sleep
No Way
way too girly
too enforced morals
Hillbilly + Girly girl = Bad combo
Exactly
;-; getting a headache from not sleeping @_@
makes all the characters look stupid
/me must stay awake!
Mmhmm
Besides, no Fluttershy, Pinkie, or RD!
Baaddd episode for first-timers.
feeling pinkie keen?
Bridle Gossip
Bridle Gossip was nice.
I really liked it.
indeed, the morals seem a bit forced,
but it is a little girl's shpw
It gives a short pause to introduce the characters to the viewer.
how long have you been awake?
Then a few hilarious changed.
*changes.
Evil Enchantress may be a bit overwhelming though.
uuuuuuuhhhh... well
Flutterguy is funny to everyone, though
Yeah
i woke up at 9am yesterday morning.. sooo
Fluttershy + Morgan Freeman
if they see at least one ep with allt he characters before that one
Lol!
20hours or something
so they get why the jokes are funny
Next, Swarm of the Century
from poinson joke
What do you think?
Pinkie at her fines
t
I don't watch Swarm of the Century too often.
It's one of the best, I tihnk.
I loved it.
Okay1
no singing, ntohing too girly
*Okay!
Instarec!
Winter Wrap Up.
The singing is great for a brony.
Outsiders?
Not so much.
if they get passed the song, then it's good
but yeah
It ruins they episode for a newcomer.
morals are a little forved, but good jokes and a good ep
Yeah
some people like songs
I dunno
Still singing the first episode is very bad.
They think they sing in every ep.
meh
yeah
Meh.
Meh tier.
Call of the Cutie
no no no
Completely revolves around tramp stamps.
they could get too mad at the annoying characters
Hell no.
Plus fillies!
doesn't work with the mane cast
psudo school drama
"Bump, bump, sugarlump rump!"
lolno
bleh
NEXT
FWF
fall
weather
Fall Weather Friends
yeah
My first episode.
I think it worked well with me.
Pinkie's commentary was hilarious.
Good. may seem a little homoerotic but it works
no singing, i don't think
celestia
Moral isn't too forced.
Overall a good episode to a newcomer.
Indeed.
However, one thing.
Maybe not the most interesting to the newcomer,
hmm?
A bit too much is put on the fact that Rainbow is a pegasus.
well,
i mean,
she is
The term "wings" is used twenty times.
it's an important part of the ep
Plus random Princess at the end.
okay, maybe not ideal, but can still be used early on
Yes.
Yes it can.
fuck yeah celestia.
Suited for Success.
nope.aj
Revolves around dresses.
y/n/
>NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
RARITY: D:
The End
watch ticket master > suited for success > best night ever
keep in context,
in order,
Feeling Pinkie Keen
and get all out of the way
A great episode,
What do you think of it?
I love it
proves it's not just about prancing ponies
as many think it does
Especially panicky Spike and damaged Twi.
Sonic Rainboom
Hmmm
the moral can come off badly to some people, but the jokes are good
hmm
Yeah
Scared RD is a boost
rarity is bad in that one
comes off as a total bitch
Still, all about believing in yourself
yadda yadda yadda
and RD being badass
can point out Doctor Whooves
Wonderbolts pretty damn cool though.
and derpy
Yay seen was spectacukar
*spectacular
yell yes
funny jokes to start with
badass later
and rainbow drinking pinkie
fuck yea rainbows
It gives you a bit of happiness.
Make them look for derpy, and notice the doctor
OH!
Stare master.
FwF
Yeah?
point of 42
on the vest
Oh yeah!
they see a refence they get, and feel better about the show
And the five Bon-Bons in the background
Okay. now Stare Master
NO.
Show Stoppers.
More CMC
...
No
Yeah, no.
hm.
OH, THE SONG!
DEFINITE NO.
hell no
I'd be okay not seeing it at all
A Dog and Pony Show.
yes
Good jokes
rarity at her best
Rarity seems so girly, but she's hilarious
actual action
Plus Spike rocks
He is kickass in this ep
"BUT I THOUGHT YOU WANTED WHIIIINNIIINGG"
gold
Agreed.
A yesisode
that's the first MLP thing I ever heard
lol
"Green isn't your color"
ZE MGICKD
s
FLOOTERSHY
sorry, i love that character
Ikr
I'd recomend it
Anna Wintour pony is best pony
but it is a little odd
wait
wait
FOREVER
A bit girly with the modeling, though,
great pinkie pie stuff
pinkie pie gold
Great Pinkie indeed.
I'd recomend it to the less-manly veiwer
"I'm so frustrated I could just scream! Aaah."
feel better?
-sigh- no.
Great episode.
-brohoof-
YES
-brohoof-
Over a Barrel
i liked it
I did too.
i'd like to be a tree
One problem: Song
Pinkies?
One solution: Nobody likes the song.
Yes, Pinkie's.
the show says the song was bad
I wouldn't worry about it
Yeah
it's a part of the joke
That's just it.
It's a good one
So the song doesn't matter.
Plus pie that solves war.
Hilarious.
apple pie wars are good
yeah
:D
Recommend.
Bird in Hoof?
yes/no
I'm unsure
er, which on is that oen agian?
Philomena?
Fluttershy?
ohh
sorry i got it now
Tea Trolling?
not really, it's a good epidode,
but not a good one to see early
Yeah.
Agreed.
metiocre
It just wouldn't come off too well.
more CMC after that
CMCC?
Hmm
huh?
oh
Revolves around butt symbols.
i am tired
and kids
er, fillies
bad to start with
mostly annoying episodes
Yeah
no
later
the ones with CMC
Owl's well that end's well.
i like it
One of my favorites.
I do too.
shows some not-so-good spike
but i like it
Yeah
and who can't love that owl
?
And the fact that he's her slave
Spike
who?
Spike's nervous laugh = Instad'aaawww
lol indeed
early, but needs some info on characters to really enhoy
enjoy
early ep.
Number one assistant = Pick up my books off the floor and put them back, bitch.
ha, it just highlighted "books"
Party of One
Loved.
I've been waiting all night for that to happen.
It.
:3
<333333
Yes
Indeed!!
Yes
YES.
The Best Night Ever.
needs some info on pinkie, but can be shown after one good ep with here
Not to a first timer
Just because
the best night ever is the last ep
They have little idea on their speculations
needs to be the last one they see
it's a good episode,
Yeah
kinda girly
THE END.
but it doesn't mastter, it's the endig
Overall, we said
Dragonshy
Bridle Gossip
swarm of the century
MAAYBBEEE FWF
Feeling Pinkie Keen
party of one
Dog + Pony Show
Green isn
owl's well
Over a Barrel
And party of one
Write this down!
You write it down, I don't ahve any pens
lol
If my 14 year old self saw myself now, i'd wonder if I had gone insane.
I just spent 4 hours in this chatroom talking (mostly) about ponies
listening to MLP music
written
and browsning /r/mylittlepony
all of them?
Yeah
Ones we said would work out
I think Party of one should be sooner,
FUUUUU NIGHTLY ROUNDUP STILL ISN'T UP
?
EqD
what's nightly round up?
Just a bunch of pony stuff that happened that day
ahh
cool
...
Now what?
??
I dunno
LOL I DUNNO
lol
:PPP
now that we spent so long talking about ponies, what else are you interested in?
other then murder?
:D
UMMMM
Weeellll
I doooo liikkekee
-pause-
St-stuff.
>_>
BRB
i messied my bed with fooc
8food
**food
..okay.
Idea!
What's something you HATE?
Wanna rant about it?
hmm...
Well, I've been trying, even before MLP not to hate things "out loud"
or at least not think about what I hate...
It's only me.
Besides, if it bottles up, you might release hate on a friend.
D:
No, I mean it's hard for me to tihnk of someting I actually hate
And friendship is magic, dawg.
D:
Oh.
Know what I hate?
WIND.
Cannot stand it.
..wind?
waht's wrong with wind?
Pushing me in directions I don't wanna go and whatnot!
lol
It makes everything 20% cooler (literally)
I just dislike wind.
The End :>
Exactly 20%
:3
?
Hmmmmmmmmm
Disuss...pony?
I'm always up for that, but we both know we both love ponies
I was hoping on talking about something else with you, since we seem to have a lot in common
but what you're comfortable with.
Okay!
That's fine with me
I'm an expendable person.
Common interests?
Exept I'm fairly terrible at starting conversations in a non-blunt way
like any anime?
tv shows?
recent movies?
musics?
fuck yeah death note
pro-kira or pro-law?
Not too much of a tv person, but I like Amazing World of Gumball, Spongebob, and Ponies
movies...
no.
WAIT
I wanna see rise of the planet of the apes!
I love Avril Lavigne and Blood on the Dance Floor.
:P
I gave you a whole bunch of ideas.
...Pro kira or pro law? (death note)
Pro-Lawliet.
A shame.
Eh
Kira is very clever.
Light is a genius.
I just find L's attention to detail and sweets charming.
Light is a genius.
I will not deny it
Kira is not a person, it's an entity
anyone who kills in the name of kira
is kira
Yes.
You are right
L is a childish decective who want's to be right.
Childish.
Yes.
he hid his face long before he needed to.
no reason
That's exactly why I like him
man of mystery
Light wants to change the world.
He does
But death is not the way
crime rates down by over 80%, and 90% of wards abandonded
wars
Light wants to be God.
Light is NOT God.
why not?
People accept him as a god
he is a god to them
Because
Light is simply upon simple luck
*used simple twice
TAKE TWO
02*WB03(Ray03)02WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
so did L, when trying to track down light
Light just had a stroke of luck.
02Hereee... for not long
06:3
But L is not trying to take the place of an almighty ruler.
no, he is trying to keep the world exactly the way it was
a rotten mess
Light shows no mercy, and kills every criminal in his path.
Light didn't want to be a god, we wanted to change the world
Regardless of their story
he accepted glory when it was given to him
Or reasonin
to prove a point to everyone else,
that crimes will not be forgicen
it worked
You hold a valid arugment sir, and I applaud you for that.
Likewise ma'am.
But death upon thousands is not the way to fix the world
I'm glad we can debate with issue.
Why not?
The way to fix the world is through understanding and compromise.
there are alread issue with population
and issues with the population doing bad things
02lol, bbl
he would probably love to change the wold with understanding
02Kthxbai
maybe he would, if he never got the death note
The population is irrelevant to the storyline
but he was given the power of death
how else is he goign to change the world when his best weapon is lethel?
it made due.
Yet he did not kill those determined by one who studied those criminals for many years.
At first he was sickened by the fact that he killed someone
He killed any criminal in his path
he killed all criminals to prove a point
Besides, if Light's plan is to "work" (I haven't finished the series. Got to L dying)
he found it neccicary
Then there will be no balance.
what do you mean
?
A world filled with all "good" people.
These criminals are here for a reason.
?
There doesn't need to be a balence
Killing all of them off would destroy the world
It didn't.
after L died it skipped to the future a couple years
Policemen would be unnecessary and thousands wuld be out of work
Continue.
there were still some crimes
like hate-crimes
things that are just sudden,
and the killer isn't thinking
just less pre-meditated murders
How so?
less cops, yes, but we don't rely on criminals for our employment
Weren't all of those people live
how so what?
Ugh
Fail grammar
sorry
?
Weren't those people killed by Light?
no, not from before
people wreestill comitting crimes
light would kill them, but he didn't stop crime
is what I am saying
crime will always exist when people do
So he killed many for know good reason
You're saying it yourself; he killed many people and crime still exists.
the reason was to keep the peace he had created
80% crime rate drop
that's a lot of crimes
He may have saved a few lives but it will come tumbling down come his death
Or whatever happens to him.
No heaven nor hell, dunno where to go.
NU
is what they said
a place where dead peopel went
it was ntohingness
nothing at all
Big white space, basically.
black, but sure.
Still: that crime drop affected the world for a few short years.
People were living in fear of death
yes, but after he stopeed killing, people starting commiting crimed again
The world was made a dirty old trashbag for a reason.
people tend to see themselves seperatly from criminals
to the point where it's "people and criminals"
Let's just end this
?
Light lets L look through the death note.
L gives Light a cupcakes.
Hugs
But....
Friendship
Magic
I don't like L.
I can see that.
I read the manga.
as it was coming out
Better
-hipster glasses=
I'm just saying
I liked kira before he became a god and sold out to the people-
We're repeating ourselves
Nah, I get it
Neither of us will win
it ends up being a loop argument
boiling down to personal morals of if it's okay to kill
We both hold valid arguments, and the answer is based on opinion.
and the definition of happiness, whatnot.
Exactly
I'm glad we can agree on that.
This was fun.
That's like saying "the moon" to aliends
*aliens
There are many moons on other planets
Some may think you mean one, while another the other.
"why do you sound... nothern?" "lots of planets have a north!"
sorry, first thing I thought of.
lol
It's okay
I'm not that huge on anime, but I've seen haruhi
enjoyable, not sure if it was actually good, but i enjoyed it.
Honestly, I never watched any cartoons when I was younger
hm
or even revently, I just really like MLP
Okay
What time is it where you are?

wow lol
I still want a proper Pokemon Snap 2
YES
rumor has it that the next pokemon game will be in 3D style (as in like pokemon coluseum as opposed to the normal RPG games)
apparently game freak was looking for someone with 3D modeling experience, and it was said that it was for their next game
course, I didn't really look much into the story
so I dunno, that probably is just rumor
@alivemeter This chat
6 This chat is 47% alive. (300)
I also doubt it'll be a main stream pokemon series game
It won't xD
nah, but if it really were a second pokemon snap game
oooohohohohoho
its strange how snap is so well loved, on paper taking photos of pokemon sounds boring
hi
but it played really well
yeah
it did
and it only had like....60 pokemon total
at most
if they made a proper one with over a couple hundred
can you imagine
how fun
that would be
Yes
have you ever played endless ocean for wii roara? (or preferably the second)
no, I wanted to though
for some weird reason, it looked fun
Ohai abronylikeyou
since it has a camera function but with zoom and depth of field abilities, plus free roaming
snap can learn a lot of lessons from it
like snap you can slap sharks too so you get them to bite :D
I WOULD SO DO THAT MYSELF IF I DID DOVE
I'm currently amusing myself by roaming around game freak's website
but yeah that was also like snap with the apples
I /was/ looking for the employment page to see if I could find that little bit about hiring a 3D designer
but I've found a ton of images from inside the company

also why you hoping for the job roara?
LOL I'm not
Rora would be a great CGI designer xD
I'm just curious, especially since the job had a picture of a 3D modeled lugia as an example of what they'll need to be able to do

it's from a small meeting or something

06i hope it was a shadow lugia :D
that's the meeting I'm talking about lol
and yeah lemme find the lugia
might it be a upgrade to the 3Dex?
http://flyingfisch.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/outline_pt01.jpg?w=320&h=216
possibly
and that would make some sense, but did game freak work on 3Ddex?
awesome! @ pic and Im not sure (checks his 3DS)
anybody here?
game freak doesn't usually do the spin offs
only the mainstream
yeah

7hmm good question.. what are you doing in the middle of the night?
7watching ponies?
Sweden
:3
cool
And in the middle of the night... I'm probably reading shipfics
wb ecco
but that prticular time i was doin- TRYING to do pushups

just thought I would mention that...
7Agreed
o rly nao? O.o
7what shampoo do you use?
Its just teaming with awesomeness
hiho :)
^^'
7I use herbal essences
/me is in a really good mood because he passed all three of his AP exams ^^
I use some special stuff for special hair from the drug store
I was really worried about it for a while
7ah :) guess what i'm listening to....
06good one Kosoveon!
hmm
I don't know you that well
lo congrats
so I give up.
what scores did you get?
gratz kosoho!
7it's Bjornfot singing winter wrap-up
Wait, Polarfire... ain't you a guy?
yes?
thanks guys
:s
I got a 4 on my US History and English exams, a 3 on my Physics
ok
I totally thought I'd bomb the physics one lol
just found it a but funny that you said my hair was beautiful x3
6everyone thinks that too
but i shouldn't
6yet 70% wind up passing
because stereotypes and gender roles are evil :c
in our school the passing rate is 33%
6but that's really good though, was that english language and comp or lit and com?
humor was the target with that comment :3
congrats Kosovo (a little late).
6comp
but your hair really is cool.
thanks ecco
and it was com
/me was a junior when he took the exams
6um
6both are com
uh
6ok, thats languange and composition
comp
6comp
right
6gtdh
XD
6both are comp
6but language is junior level, literature is senior
ok, my eyes are blanking out
ok
/me just realized that both a boy and a girl complimented his looks and singing voice
language XDDDD
likeaboss.jpg
6but yeah, language was fairly difficult LOL
you need shades.
6there was stuff in there I was like....WTF IS THIS D:
6it only gets funner in literature and composition
6>>
/me slaps bjornfot a around a bit with a large trout.
the essays were really just...ugh
I guess you could say... that I am... *sunglasses* bi-winning
the material I had to write about was the least exciting possible
YYYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH
I'm not gay.
but your hair is still awesome.
ofcourse you're not
especially the synthesis essay
which was about locavores
6same
being gay is just as silly as being straight
6lol my synthesis essay was about whether or not we should keep the penny as a form of money
6which isn't too bad of a topic
6until you realize "crap HOW MANY PAGES do I have to write again?"
6that topic is so hard to drag out into 3 pages
6let alone longer
but 3 or 5 paragraphs a 3 page essay does not make
HEY WHATPAYNE
talk to us
bye bye
6have you ever learned the schafer paragraph style?
ewhat?
6</spelling>
isn't that the five sentence per graph thing
*paragraph
6I love how that was very very VERY heavily emphasized in my freshman and sophomore years................and then junior year my teacher said "yeah um...you'll never EVER use that again, and if you do, you'll fail"
6yeah
hello, beautiful weather we are having.
*sentences
yes.
well.
its raining : /
yeah it's like when in elementary they tell you to start off certain essays with a question
It's hot as hell here. I'd like some rain.
but if you actually do that on the ap exam
It was 105 yesterday.
they say you look like an idiot
plus about 50 to 60% humitidy.
and now its raining -.-
um... That's quite lot more than what I'm experiencing...
like "Have you ever heard of the industrial revolution?" when talking about child labor in the 1900s
what is your temp?
eight years ago my teacher totally would have suggested that, but if I asked my english teacher last year if that was good he'd literally laugh his head off
where you're at
Fahrenheit?
about 85...
what counrty are you from?
Finland
so basically I've been rewriting habits instill in me since first grade
*instilled
oh XD
6yep
I... We are not that accustomed to hot temperatures.
yeah summers are pretty deadly where I'm at.
6thats actually why I suck at writing noe
6now
6habits from early years are so hardwired into my brain
6I can't really get out of it
it sucks
105 F? Without AC I'd be dead.
hooray for ac :3
The best thing since sliced bread.
hmm
Or something like that...
is finland a lot like the us?
that's one of my favorite "sayings"
In what way?
yeah
I'm not sure.
I kind of had the same probably with the history exam, but in a different way
I just thought most sayings were pretty region-specific
but I guess not.
but that's enough ramblings.
lol
because back in elementary/junior high my teachers told me when writing an claim-based history essay that it's okay to glorify whatever you're supporting
oh you silly finns
6oh god
Think of Sweden, but slightly more to east
there's nothing to like about USA
but my history teacher from last year told me that was too flowery or whatever
so like
when talking about the new deal
also, you have far less muslims
the movies are pretty cool.
people would just talk about the good it did, and none of the bad
kinda
For the moment... Our immigration policies are too loose for many people's likings.
but Scandinavia is pretty well known for not liking USA
that's part of why the exam was difficult for me, because i was really only taught the good it did
That's not true.
HA!
barely any of the bad
Just look at Sweden.
THIS is fucking loose!
6yeah
:c
10% of swedens population is immigrants
Bjornfot you are from Sweden?
ja
but anyways, bbl XD
We were once the richest country in nothern europe
ok... Yeah. Some say that we must avoid that what happened to Sweden with immigration.
gonna see if they have the 3DS charger thing at gamestop
now we're below average in europe thanks to our socialistic politics and massive immigration
that extends the battery life
Finland is now king of the hill
6o.o
And yeah - don't repeat our mistake.
6extends?
6never heard of that lol
yeah
as in if you attach it to the back of the 3DS it doubles the battery life
makes it more bulky but i honestly don't care lol
6o.o
6thats pretty legit lol
I mean, this is crazy.
Bjornfot who has more muslims than who?
excuse me for not knowing that much about scandinavia :S
The immigration problem plagues most of EU.
I have it
We don't have nearly enough jobs for those finishing school each year
The nyko one is good :3
No problem, Polarfire.
nor do we have enough houses for everyone wanting to move away from mom and dad
hmm
and our economy is a national low
sounds like you guys are worse off than us :S
we can't afford giving the elderly proper pension and care
despite all this
Well Scandinavian countries don't have same problems with housing as US.
Yet...
We INSIST on taking in AS MANY IMMIGRANTS AS POSSIBLE
yeah.
we're #1 most immigrant friendly in the world
Our politicians are trying to do the same here.
that would not really be a problem
the housing market over here is bad right now.
except that we give each and every one of them FREE HOMES, FREE STUFF, FREE MONEY
Exactly!
they are not even ALLOWED to get a job
For the first time in over a century, housing prices dropped about 25%.
here.
in 2008
because they're forced to re-take school in swedish first
and now, I forget the exact number,
It's the social welfare which draws people form poorer mostly Muslim countries to live under the wing of those working and paying taxes.
but I think Its about 20% of all homes are vacant.
and when they than can't get a job, because guess what - THERE ARE NO AVAILABLE JOBS - we just continue giving them social penny
Bjornfot you should be a politician.
no
they will just say that i'm racist
you explain things well and you are very level-headed.
Which is what most politicians aren't.
everyone who don't want to spend humungus amounts of money on immigration is a racist, you see
Which is why we have this problem. If you refuse taking immigrants you get stigmatized as racist.
And none wants to be racist.
we do it because we want to look "good"
0_o Do what?
hey Dman.
Hai Polarfire!
Hello
what's up?
mass immigration
hi whatpayne
Talking politics.
Not much :P
i'm about to work on something that i'm sure Bronystate will be using quite a bit. Gonna be a lot of work thou
I heard about that.
what is it?
hm? Colour me intrigued.
Skah!! <3
An anti-muslim forcefield?
:3
x3
oh you
lol what?
What questions do you have so far?
BTW Are there any muslim Bronies?
:P
there must be some
I guess...
maybe not many in muslim countries
but there are muslims all over europe
why are you asking?
it's not like they are evil
I'm wondering out loud here...
although USA wants us to think that
I don't think they are evil.
Like we say here. Problem is not immigration, problem is Islam.
lolwut
but a lot of terrorists are muslim.
really payne
muslim extremists that is.
Well the truth in my opinion is that problem is the Economic refugees who do not want to even try to adapt.
02*WB03(May03)02WB* - <May> I always thought you were one of the smartest people here
Hello
yeah...
HI
true payne
ohai marl
Muslims, as far as terrorism goes.
ah
muslim-extremists
Welcome to armchair politics, Brony edition.
I guess US does not have the immigration problem since there is no social welfare?
^
We do have some immigration issues.
but not like what you describe.
you have a really huge dept though?
Many immigrate illegally, work for a few months, then break the law and get a free ride back to their home country.
yes we have a HUGE debt.
10Lurkan RBD is stealan all Bjornfot's dox
Well at least they work.
thanks to your useless warring
OHAI RAINBRO
10your youtube is mine.
lolwu
10I R STALK NAO KTHXBAI
oooooooooooooookay
10shh
10HAI POLARFIRE
10How's it going? :3
I'm scared...
yeah, they work, but they still take advantage of our jobs.
Its kinda annoying but not a huge huge problem like the debt is.
then stop waging war
and rainbro I am doing great. What about you man?
I'm not touching that.
what?
go ahead.
The whole war thing? It's really convoluted.
10Polarfire I am doing just fine and dandy thank ye very much :D
oh.
and that's good rainbro :3
10been chillin at a mate's house; gaming for days
10basically I have the best life right now
XD
10:>
lucky.
10I know right
10part of me feels bad for flaunting it
well as far as the war goes, OBL is dead so I don't see what they are waiting on.
10but the other part is all OHOHO I LOVE LIFE
ah.
lol
the whole terrorist network is a mess.
Its a big network of people mixed in with innocent civilians.
Hey GL
The operate under cover, and move around a lot,
making them a very difficult target.
12Hia HML :3
Tell me about it... Or more importantly tell the Norwegians.
There is no definite enemy.
06heya GL :3
how do you fight that?
Its like trying to fight the Anonymous.
You can't
you can't just blow them up because they are right there with the innocent people.
They have nothing for you to target.
I know...
If you kill 1, 5 more move in to replace him and the network moves on like nothing happens.
bjornfot y u leave? D:
We'll they say that al qaeda has lost a lot of it's strength.
*Well
yeah.
But ponies are still awesome no matter what.
but the thing is they will regain their strength almost immediately if the military leaves
because the middle east is so corrupt.
And yes, ponies are the best thing since AC and sliced bread.
:3
ohai DCD
I agree with that
whoa
are you going to stream something for us? :3
loads of people for a dead hour
at 7 PM EST
I WARN YOU THOUGH
tonight's stream
is going to be
what will it be?
....bizzare doesn't cut it
let's just say I lost a bet
XD
I can't wait.
Oh... Now I'm curious
We have stream tonight?
Time to stay upp till 1am
I have to go do a couple things soon but I will be back for the stream.
see you guys soon.
see you
it's this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BjIzYpwcEw
so yeah
you've been warned
and yes, that's Mai Shiranui, Dizzy, Noel Vermillion, Lili Rocheforte.....
This'll be fun, won't it?
ooo, fun?
what'd i miss? HUH HUH HUH!?
...and Ivy Valentine.....
WOO, DCD!
...and the Queen's Blade Characters.
yes
this is going to be risque. So you've been warned
does this mean that there will be streaming?
sure does
I'm playing though it right now, and all I can say is "Jeebus, Japan."
7 PM EST
/me grabs popcorn
...awwwww
It's happened many times... I see something bizzare and wonder what the hell
at that time, we'll play "LET'S SEE HOW QUICKLY A QUEEN'S BLADE GAME CAN OFFEND OUR SENSITIVITIES!"
But then I see it's from Japan
and all is explained
additionally
you might want to bring some booze
take a shot every time someone's clothes rip or there's fanservice, if you're brave
let's see how fast you get toxicosis

06xD
Hi.
its a bit sad though people make websites and protests with the sole intention of trying to insult a product or company...
what they should be protesting about is the ever increasing charges for video games and online gaming and trying to kill off cheaper pre-owned games *runs*
so yeah
you've been warned
tonight's stream might offend sensitivities
rly?
This is going to be SO. AWESOME!
casualization of video games
though i'm pretty much a casual :V
aka Wii/Kinect?
Yeah, those things. That reminds me of something I saw the other day.
I saw something about a new pod racer game, and it reminded me of Star Wars Episode 1 racing on the N64
actually another thing is the degradation of single player games in favour of online multiplayer. This is one thing COD I can safely say is guilty for, however the best suspect is homefront
Then I read "Kinect" and I was like "NOOOOOO"
LOL I know the one you mean
actually wii is ok, its just no good games for it since maybe SMG2 (which was a clone of the first basically)
>mfw i'm wearing a SMG shirt right now
>mfw I don't have SMG
>mfw i don't have a face
mew
/me hugs Skah
o,o
I didn't like the second tbh, it was an actual Nintendo made Mario game that didn't feel fresh...quite a feat really
smg + yoshi = smg2
now we're getting all the remakes too, OoT, SF64, MGS3 for 3DS
isn't it
>3ds
nope
/me huggles Cat.
Hi!
meow
sup?
give me one example of a 3ds game that isn't a sequel or a remake. :V
er
good 3ds game
6lol
The cowboy armadillo one?
o.o
two, increasingly lackluster SP games in favour for racist, anger fuelled 12 year old filled MP online (and tbh I don't get any enjoyment out of MP anymore)
and third remakes/reboots
I would argue something along the lines of "upkeep costs" but MS isn't like in need of money or anything, and Sony obviously just provides it free.
And Nintendo.
actually OoT3D is good, very good @ Zoroark it's just that timeless game plus seeing the Ocarina characters in HD and 3D was a treat. But yeah otherwise very valid point
I actually have XBL for like 6 more months
oh and one more thing....all the good games coming out within a few months of each other >.> SF643D, MGS3D, Skyward Sword, GOW3, CODMW3, BF3, SR3 come out like in the last two or three months of the year!
its gonna be a helluva expensive Xmas for parents
I know you can pay for it.
ok
I'm back

It seems like not much going on here right now.
Exactly
Woah ^ "+++ RDash set to mode +xiw" Apparently I'm a mod now. Bow to me!

I think that the RP thing might've had something to do with my first pony related dream that I remembered.
That's good at least
And what was that?
Somepony turned off the gravity and I had to ride a bike for some reason. It made sense in the dream.
.....A bike.In SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE!
SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE!
You must know how hard it is to run in 0-gravety. A bike is 10X worse!
@bikesmeter SPAAAAAAAAACE

Quite a few out there

Levitating still works though :P
Yeah.With da magiczs.
Magiczs and levitation go hand in hand.
I don't know if I ever turned the gravity back on. Hope I don't have a surprise tonight
And space
I know about da magiczs because i am an alicorn.
and a pegasus?
An alicorn means i have a horn AND wings.
I was about to look it up just in case...
But,silly me,i don't have a cutie mark.And i probably never will.

random info: last question done ' What colour glasses does Twist wear?'
AMAX certified AM stereo/FM stereo auto reverse cassette radio
Answer it guys
: D
the AM section sounds very much like FM does on most tuners
03interesting
blue?
the trick is the RF bandwidth it looks at is much wider
10 to 15 KHz on AM vs the 4.5 to 5 KHz most have
03so I saw this car the other day with a HUGE antenna, the guy obviously shoved like 3 normal sized antennas on there XD
Blue.
perhaps
Eeyup.
Give me a minute.
ok
/me np: Sara Evans - Missing Missouri [04:16m/1042kbps/44kHz]
its working!
03I've also seen those license plates that say "Amateur radio"
03and lets them have a shorter number
well more like call letters
those are assigned to them by the FCC
03no, I mean
03you know how a normal license plate is like ABC123?
03then there are ones that say things like Air Force, and let you have a 4 digit one
03etc
03you can get amateur radio ones too
I could get an amateur radio plate
I qualify for one once I start driving
03LOL you don't drive yet?
not yet
the song I am listening to actually has a geographical reference only those who live or lived in Missouri would get
the most unique feature of the state known as the boot heel
geographically its unique
Ok it's up now.
I've got no sound.
me neither
same
Meh, it always resets.
I have to put it on manually.
Sec.
Hmm.
hey guy have i missed much?
Nope
Does anypony have a good program to automatically save a chatroom as text?
kl kl and fraid not dman
Oh well, winter-puff, thanks for replying ; )
no other state has anything like it
Some other IRC clients should have logging features. mIRC does.
No, trying to work out why sound isn't working, it wasn't off.
Is it online now?

07and that's saying something.
Ok, now.
Sound should work.

And what about it :o
07I dont mind

Yay spaceships!
07haha, well
i'm not watching it ;__; can't right now
07it's a bit of an insignificant/unnecessary detail
but still, hanging with bronies ^_^
07it does matter though
03I know it is
03it's just like
03they made a big deal out of it in the first one
Why not?
07for the quidditch cup lol.
07Haha
03and then kinda abandoned it
07yeah

Bai Bird
03god seriously ABC

03movie ends
0310 seconds of end credits
03COMMERCIAL
03rest of end credits
03WHY
03it just makes editing the commercials out a bigger pain >_>
03But yes, they showed the first Harry Potter last week on ABC, broadcast TV :P
That was the entire point xD
Hey Bjornfot,you wanna join me,Dman,RDash and Apokalipse on the RP channel?
Hey, I totally forgot about that
I'm a bad enough dude!
03Darn it
Was there any other censors on the movie? :P
03they lost some of the music
03in that
03um
03I don't know
03I doubt it
03it was TV-PG and the movie is rated PG
Yeah
03and HP doesn't really have any swearing in it
03THOSE movies, I mainly wanted TV recordings for the aspect ratio
0316:9 instead of uber-wide
03XD
Except for that last movie
:P
03well yeah
03but they can prolly leave that in
03they leave it in the BTTF movies
Bad Dudes FTW,and also i'm late
03yay using four hard drives at once?
How is that exciting :P
Sounds boring </sarcasm>
03because some people don't even have that many hard drives?

9so yeah
03yeah, I love this movie
03I just got it as a Digital Copy®
9more like DERP RAIDER with me
03now to rip the Windows Media version, this is the iTunes one
NewDCD is it gonna be some extreme event on screen?
03I mean, Amazon was selling it for $6
Lol, I don't think I've ever got very far with Tomb Raider.
03that's cheaper than buying the movie on iTuens LOL
also, oh god, when tomb raider goes wrong, it's hillarious
03*Tunes
Horray Amazon
9I'll assure you it will be a very WTF JAPAN event
Saving us all from evil
:)
I like this
03I know right
I once played a tomb raider game. I played it and there was suddenly a rock that scared the crap out of me
NewDCD, will it involve BUTTENZ
Evil local retailers that is >.>
?
9good idea
9it probably should
9send me the page again

LOLupdates
03manually copying and pasting the files off the disc
You mean
03screw using the "Digital Copy Manager"
03all that does is copy it anyway
03and make you watch ads
03>:_>
03*>_>
03well nah
03I copy the files to the hard drive
03then go to oplay them
03insert the one time use code
03once I get the license, just run FairUse4WM to decrypt them
03>:P
Profit?
Haha
ooooooh shiny buttons
03the thing is
03I have to use a virtual machine of Windows XP
Same here
03as it's like, physically impossible to decrypt Windows Media on anything newer
03even on XP, you have to set it up specially
03and disable Windows Update
03or else it'll update the DRM and make it not work
03stupid Microsoft
/me 7meeps.
i better hear at least one epicly used for epiclytimed moment OBJECTION, NewDCD, as as i have said i'm a huge fan of Ace Attourney ;D
My laptop can't update itself
7I'm going to be at Otakon tomorrow. :U
What is thatr
-r
03well Windows Updates in WIndows 7 actually work
7Well, the day after.
/me runs
9the game we're going to play is very OBJECTIONABLE so I suppose you will hear it
: D
although i cant watch for like 2 hours
ok, here it is:
03wtf digital copy
I like WU in 7, as I always select remind me in 4/9 hrs xD
03Windows says this 4GB DVD has CDFS
03>CD File System
03>Meant for CDs, not DVDs
Wat
I set up friend's projector to watch a jackie cahn film that just started, but his laptop derp'd so we're watching it from my laptop on projector
Fail formatting much
so i can be here, but not hear volume or it will be heard thru speakers
03yeah, digital copy is the most pointless thing ever, but, if I can get it for free/very cheap, I like collecting them
03decrypted obviously, or it defeats the purpose
Which movie?
Ohai Derp
03and, decrypting Independence Day
jackie chan the tuxedo aka for non brits the smokin'
03I, Robot will be next
03yay two movies that start with the same letter?
Will Smith movies :O
Or..
NO
Ern
something all us here (about 6) wanna watch
Forget it x.x
03Will Smith FTW though
But yes, horray same letter movies
I am derping today
Aw, old school jackie chan is best jackie chan.
/me has been playing too much Aemagetron
03XD
03nice
03isn't that game awesome?
03I should install it on here
Oh DRF
Jackie Chan is always best Jackie Chan
Can I send you some audio samples
Like, from the first TRON movie
9that movie isn't so oldschool
XD
yup! but i liked his role in karate kid eeven if he didn't do much. SO MUCH WISDOM
9I mean, Jennifer Love Hewitt was in it
and like NewDCD says
Well, for the game/bike sfx that is
03um
03what for
there are way more oldschool movies with way better action
Read up
The game
9"Karate" Kid was actually a pretty good movie. It really would've been better as a standalone IP though
I know. I was saying his older stuff is better. Back when he could do all the crazy ass stunts himself.
I lost it
03LOL
03no but I mean
i think my fave movie is drunken master if i HAD to pik one
03why do you want to send me audio files
03you don't want to sell me death sticks, you want to go home and rethink your life
9I want us to watch oldschool John Woo sometime
9like The Assassin or For a Better Tomorrow
LOL xD
NewDCD i never thought of that! it's own title would have been amazing! but then critics would'a gone DERP THIS IS KUN' FOO KID
Because you'd geek?
03dude
03I Have the movie on DVD and Blu-Rasy
03-s
/me 7pokes Feather.
Oh good
NewDCD - vote for it ! if you're pickd ;)
:P
9pretty much
OR watch on a weekday with us!
9my first choice would be
9Kamen Rider THE FIRST tho'
But ATA has terrible bike sfx anyway
Ofc
03what the frick is wrong with my HD Radio
HD radio o.o
03ye[/
03*yep
Is it standalone or a PCI card thing?
03it's standalone
03as far as I know, they don't exist as PC cards
Check the kitchen :P
stand alone
The microwave might be turned on again
03LOL
03hm
HD Radio receivers are also known as IBOC-DAB receivers
03it's not getting any reception o-O
these are stand alone tuners

03and, here we go
is it working now?
03no.
check your antenna
03it can't find any of the HD radio signals
03hm
you would be driven nuts if you were listening to FM in central Indiana
03why>?
most stations on the dial play country
03EW
03we have like 4 stations here now that play top 40 :>
03well, 106.7 is the one I listen to the most anymore
and its the same crap that is being plugged in the charts
03and that's "adult contempary"
but EWW RAP!
03so they play all sorts of stuff
03they were playing *NSYNC earlier XD
adult contemporary is a decent format
03yeah
but top 40 has gone to pot
03I quite like it
03they play rap on 106.7 too :P
central Indiana actually has Radio Disney on FM
sort of rare
Brb, dinner
03uh, FM is the one that's a long wire that plugs into coaxial, right?
yes
03Why the frick is it not working
but usually that does not cut it for HD Radio
03I have the wire stretched out
03that's what came with the tuner...
03it used to work fine
so you need a better antenna for reliable reception
I had that problem back in Washington
the HD Radio signals around me were weak with the exception of 104.3
03WHAT THE HECK
03It's not even working with *analog* FM radio
03something is majorly broken here
so I needed a big antenna for good reception
the antenna connector
03uh
03no it's not
03though m
03hm
check it
03do you suppose rabbit ears would work?
03how?
does the connector wiggle considerably?
03nope
03it's been plugged in for like a year
03just sitting on the shelf
sometimes its a firmware bug
try unpluging the radio and pluging it back in
these things are actually computers in disguise
03hm
they run custom firmware and have issues from time to time
03alright let me try
HD Radio receivers are actually SDR sets usually
SDR meaning software defined radio
but their demodulator settings cannot be changed by the end user
03heh
03I wish I could just stream dump HD radio
03even if i have to convert it to something
you can't
PAC
03imagine if you have a computer card that just saves it as PCM
03PAC?
actually no not PAC
HDC
High Definition Coding
03yeah I've heard of HDC
its a proprietary codec developed by Ibiquity
PAC is Perceptual Audio Coding
that is used for satellite radio
03THERE we go
03thanks that worked
03just unplugging it and plugging it in
no problem
03not sure why it needed that
that is the first thing to tru
03guess because I haven't used it a year?
*try
03or more
03and see
might be a microprocessor burp
as I call them
03I know it's proprietary but I mean
03rather than outputting as analog
03if it output as PCM
03to a computer
03:P
03actually, mine has optical outpuit./
03*output
03so in theory, I could do something similar
03I just don't have a way to process optical on my computer, only output it
9Everything's set up
9last warning, fillies: this is going to be a mindfuck in more ways than one
true
NewDCD - aww! i can't watch it for anther hour or so! : (
I hope your'es till here with dem buttonz in an hour
Just to sorta check it out first. some questions might be too obvoius / hard
03fail
03I'm taping this antenna to my ceiling and I dropped the role of tape down the stairs
03my mom was like O_O
03stupid wire is like 10 feet long
you had the right idea trying to elevate it
03Yeah
03I'm not stupid :P
that usually helps
03I just wish I could stick a PCI card into my computer and dump HD radio to something
rabbit ears would help a bit more though
03rather than needing this giant settop and then ripping over analog
03that's just stupid
but STAY AWAY FROM THE AMPLIFIED ONES!
03but it's still better than analog radio I suppose
6Why is it so dead these days? ._.

resulting in drop outs
if you need more gain you are better off with a roof top antenna
those provide a good deal of gain but they are passive
no amplifiers
thus no noise introduced
03alright, there we go
03it's really tacky but it will do for now
03I only really need to record a few songs off of 106.7 and then I can put the HD radio back away for a year XD
I don't use mine all that much for over the air FM
heeello?
Hi bjornfot
the Delco might get more use
OHAI
03hm
03what is RDS?
You wanna come into the ponyRP channel Bjornfot?
03It switched from RDS to HD
03once it found a signal
Radio Data System
9are you fillies ready to be mindfucked in eight minutes?
03o.o
03what's that actually mean?
9also invite whomever doesn't value their sanity, as always
i am ready
oh yeah dcd
03Darn it
Sadly no i can't =[ But I can't wait to read reactions!
03106.7 has crappy HD radio reception
Isn't RDS quite rare in NA?
its text data mostly including some aditional bits which can be used for among other things traffic information
not anymore
its becoming more and more common
RDS is the comeback kid on FM
03http://i.imgur.com/Ogo8s.jpg
03I wonder if splitting the two ends up is what caused it to start losing signal;
RDS is very, very popular in Europe (or at least something similar to RDS).
03had a great 4-bar signal for 95.5 but 106.7 basically doesn't have a HD radio signal at all
(At least in Germany.)
it actually is RDS
/me np: The Ramones - Blitzkrieg Bop [02:11m/128kbps/44kHz]
(Last time I went, I was in a wonderfully boring Opel Astra, the radio had the ability to break into a music CD with traffic reports. Using RDS. :P )
EXTREME STEREO SEPARATION AHOY!
that meant a radio station was transmitting the traffic flag
WB SKY
10Thanks
a bit indicating traffic information being sent out by a radio station
yes
its a tacky setup
in more ways than one
03should I move the two ends closer together?
03or does that nolt really matter
03*not
move them further apart if anything
9five minutes
03hm
what you have there is a half wave dipole antenna
03in English please
=D
03and yeah, 1067.7 has *no* HD radio signal now x.x
ideally you want the two elements to be a T shape
03wait what
well the whole antenna you want to be in a T shape
03so take the one end and make it cross the other?
no
...
No.
03I'm confused
03got a picture of what it should look liek then?
no
03x.x
because its been years since I used an FM dipole
Let me get a link.
http://www.electronics-radio.com/articles/radio/antennas/dipole/half-wave-dipole.gif
03ah
03so you mean the ends should be like | rather than < ?
yes
03OK
Yes, the angle between them should be 180.
9we're live
(And with the feedline perpendicular to that.)
I hear you
I hear you
03That worked.
03Nice.
03I get a 4 bar signal again
o-o
03now I just need to finish taping it
/me drums along
03as it's hanging off the ceiling XD
9Yes, those are the characters you're thinking they are.
OHO OHO OHO.
=[ *seesnothing* but oh wlel, film nearing end. I wanna see some funny reactions should mindrape occur! :P
9LOLI Y U RIDE GIRL AS CAT
IS THAT SOME TITSGATE SPIRAL ASS?
9yes. yes it is.
because Seikon no Qwaser
...
9and tonight, I'm going to be your guide through the mindfuck
9oh

OHO OHO OHO.
BEWBS
Hmm... Iiiiinteresting....
03my mom got mad at me even for using Scotch tape
03saying it would rip the paint
03duct tape = NO
(Do not staple into the wire, staple across.)
BEEWBS
03yes, I know how to staple wires.
BEWBS
03but this is also thicker
03than speaker wire
srsly wtf
MAI MOLESTED?
03and this is a temporary solution
B00Bs, B00Bs, lack of B00Bs.
Well, you can do what many a very lazy HAM has done...
Say "Hello" to PVC pipe. :P
erm...wow...0.o
9also if you guys don't recognize Mai Shiranui, I'm disappoint

So, would anyone here be dedicated enough to help moderate a PO server for TST? lol
Dashite ok then

/me parties
o.o
/me 's mind is untouched as of yet.
PHEW

How are you today?
so, any volunteers? but that doesn't mean I will mod you, just want to see who's up for the job?

NS's mind is just cocks atm :P
10!pokescram
Scrambled word is "ucahri". To guess at what the word is type !pokeguess (Your guess here). Type !pokehint, !pokehint2 or !pokehint3 for a hint.

hi Kos

Hi J
9clothing damage is actually something you should do

.ew
Ew, Sony Vaio
(hope that nobody's on one right now :P)
/me now belongs to Skylands for 10 minutes and has to fly Skylands around until then
!shipping
careful saying that around me
I like a number of things Sony has made
/me 7suddenly hmms randomly.
7I can't think of anyone I'm currently fangirling over. O_o
/me np: Everclear - AM Radio [03:46m/852kbps/44kHz]
I like most Sony products (unlike drf :P) but I don't like the newer Viaos
I think getting this setup is a cause for celebration
Everclear's AM Radio
in AM stereo
I PM'd Articuno and she liked the ideas
7Oh.
7I didn't, NS, but yay!
There is 1 AM radio channel here in Teverola xD
7Did she state anything specifically?
She said she probably wouldn't be able to code the bird creator
D=
I'm going to try but I can't guarantee anything because it's quite a difficult app
7Hmm.
we actually do have some AM stations that operate in stereo in the midwestern US
9EAT BULLETS
9SHOOT THEM THROUGH YOUR ARM
a couple I can get at night are WLS 890 Chicago and KCJJ 1630 Iowa City
i thought they were medals
9OH SHIT SON
7You've mentioned finding a template online.
9YOU COUNT THE MEDALS ONE TWO AND THREE
I did?
WAT TE FAK
I HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATE JB
x_x
you can eat bullets and fire them through arms?
7Or a template of some sort. o.O
Well, I'm going to do it in javascript
then again, who doesnt hate him
Who does-
Or if that fails, VB or java
WELL.
7Flash?
oh god flash
credits are up soon i shall see. seriously wtf is this
._________________.
7No? :P
7All right.
I could try that /if/ I can't do the others
My dad used to listen to 710 KIRO back in Washington
7Well, thank you. :)
Of course not lol.
7Though we actually need bits and pieces of birds to customize. :P
ugh KIRO
good :3
another infamous blah blah blah talk station
Mmmhmmmm
my favorite up there was KYCW 1090
I'm more concerned about the coding for the time being
the images can't be that hard
Classic Country 1090
7All right.
7Nope.
His voice annoys me, most high pitched voices do.
I'll most like just cut out outlines
IDK why he liked 710 KIRO
Motorola C-QUAM AM stereo with Orban processing
not to mention MUSIC!
I do like KIRO 7 news, though
9ladies and gentlemen...chances of clothes ripping: high as fuck
9luckily, it didn't happen
They did a good job, TV news >>>>>>>>>>>>>> radio news
oh lol
even where I was I got good reception of them on just a Walkman
it was a Sony SRF-42
look THAT one up
Ok
its a very unique
little receiver
Hmmm
Interesting
I was able to get several AM stations in stereo back around 2001 and 2002
KGHO 920, KLOG 1490, KYCW 1090, KKSN 1520, and KPBC 1640
7NS, late, but, you can get transparency in Javascript, right? o.O
;p
all during the day
7Well, actuallly...
Haha, KLOG
7In those sorts of tools, you have some sort of already-designed base which you just edit parts.
that is a real one
its in Longview WA
Hi Obsi
their logo even said this for a while
7I'm pretty sure Rora or another artist can design his or her own art for that.
"KLOG 1490 AM STEREO"
it was a green ball with headphones on it
xD
they sounded AMAZING in those days!
*wonders if he could've gotten KLOG from Kitsap County*
Did you live in WA before?
yep
Toledo WA
you would not have heard KLOG from Kitsap County
it was in Cowlitz County
i'm about to press play
g2 get headphones, don't know what de fuk's gonna come out of the stream
Too many Toledos
Toledo, Iowa
the reason why I heard them is because I was in southern Lewis County
Toledo, Ohio
Toledo, Spain
Toledo Oregon
AND Toledo, Washington
yep
Oh, ok
Random question: What would you do for a Klondike Bar, everybody?
you would have been able to hear KGHO 920 and KYCW 1090 in Kitsap County
KGHO was oldies back then
It's like he sings in the bathroom.
Hmm
My mom liked 95.7 KJR FM
that is a nice one
This page is in Spanish. Would you like to translate it?
probably
can't go wrong with classic rock much of the time
else I can do some CSS code for it
wat?
Apparently it was Seattle's only oldies FM station after 97.3 changed to news
yea
and aniway NewDCD and I speak spanish =D
though IE absolutely craps bricks at alpha
I HATED that
Yeah
97.3 switching to talk
-moz-opacity works fine, alpha/opacity for IE does not
News Talk 97.3 = The talk you don't want to hear from 710, only clearer
KYCW 1090 switching to talk royally ticked me off
Hi Luna
same with KGHO 920
I much prefer good music to talk
7If there are alternate ways of doing that, that'd help. :P
KGHO was proud of what they did
I remember their top of the hour ID to this day
sorry guys
apparently
the internet company hasn't been charging the bill like they should
since we had a direct discount plan
"Our call letters are KGHO, our city of license is Olympia, our dial position 920 AM stereo, our specialty good time hit oldies
so they cut off my internet for a sec and sent me a notice
now they are allowing me to browse again
7Well, NS, you can, I suppose start the sketch of the program.
but I still got to fix this problem
as you can tell I listened to them quite a bit
LOL xD
Yup
R
D
even had some recordings of them off of the Sony SRF-42 in stereo
What game is this?
9let's continue our descent into madness, then
Yes I do.
Is it hentai or frightening?
most people think AM just has crappy telephone quality mono
but I have heard it with HIFI stereo sound
I like the Italian radio here, but it's different
9it's a spinoff of Queen's Blade that also has fighting game characters like Dizzy and Noel Vermillion and Ivy Valentine in it
Depends on how good your signal is
9that should tell you everything you need
Seems boring.
true
FM could sound bad too in an area with poor reception
9I love SRPGs
exactly
Like Seabeck :P
or White Pass
AKA where I was
you should have tried it
listening to FM while going over White Pass
it was craptastic
Or the area before you reach Leavenworth
No radio at all
except on AM
This game goes incredibly well with our RPing...
AM will usually work where FM is spotty
I think there were about 3 AM stations, and only 1 was coherant
also, any suggestions for mods on PO? @ Quan
especially at night
just going to ask whether anyone wants to mod it
because ionosphere FTW!
Yup
which doesn't mean i'm going to actually mod them though lol
actually shortwave works there too
on White Pass
Seeing as I know he's used PO with me before
I remember listening to the BBC up there
They have BBC radio in WA?
ok i playe'd and am now here! : D
nope
just over shortwave
Oh
I was hearing it from a site in Assencian Island
What's shortwave?
in the Atlantic
9you're one hell of a masochist bro
basically bands between 3 and 30 MHz
Is THIS the mindrape game?
doesn't seem like it so far
9you haven't seen nothing yet
Ok
there are broadcast bands in this range where stations can cover entire continents with ease
lul
Wow
7I don't know how PO exactly works, so I'll leave that to whoever does. :P
Call PETA
7@ NS/
Call RSPCA
So you got BBC?
I used to hear NHK's external broadcasts direct from Japan over shortwave
That's amazing
I can even here
9fuck your shit bro
9JAPANESE MARMADUKE MUST DIE
Dang
>DAT UP THE SKIRT SHOT ok
9>wield dual handguns
That's far away
9>Use them as daggers
9ok
are those 2 guns that shoot fukken bluefirelazors?
4,400 miles
this is pretty japanese so far : P
from Tokyo to where I was
but that is not all
but it ain't mindrape
12derp
...yet
9you haven't gotten there yet
12bbl
9give it time
11,000 miles from Assencion Island and 12,000 from St. Helena Island
I haven't set the server up yet since I ran out of time last night
9why do you think everyone else went OH GOD WHAT
That's lo ger than the US from west to east, rightt?
9I mean man
9I'm playing this shit
0__o
9I should know
yes
*longer
hah hah hah
shortwave is something
even in this day and age a twist of the dial can take you around the world
That'd be a neat feature to have in a car radio
9AWW SHIT
some do
CRUSH!
9there you go
WTF
ok i got that much
9I told you.
ever heard of DRM?
I could see if it was possible for me to get 95.7 xD
hah hahahaha
But I'll set it up tonight hopefully
it would not be
Nope
they are not on shortwave
DRM is Digital Radio Mondiale
Aww
9now do you believe me?
>TITS JIGGLING
basically digital radio over LW/MW/SW
>TITS JIGGLING EVERYWHERE
hmm
there are DRM car radios that get shortwave
both analog and digital
EPIC
HAHAHAHA
/me considers videorecording this
We just have a standard Toyota stock radio in our car
So none of that cool stuff
that might have LW if you got it in Europe
Just AM/FM1 and 2
guess not then
bondage much
AM in Europe has a different step
radio stations are at 9 KHz intervals
9you don't recognize Dizzy?

14well that's the thing
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
hahaha
cuz i saved?
yeah
and i'm still reading now...
9why is the song not Noel's BB theme, I have no clue
I've read...enough haha
14a warning of what not to do and what you should do is adequate, I would think
06not attracting it, more like keeping it
06afaik
9and why does she look so badass in this game when she's normally the butt monkey?
oh you silly billys
9...and why do we have no Nu-13?
...fuck. i have a semiboner, pegahorn, and still reading
Y U
14not... "YOU'RE BREAKING THE RULES +REMOVE TOPIC/POST"
10^ There hasn't been much of that, in fact hardly at all
14if anyone didn't get it
lol apokaliplse 's comment
14well
14perhaps maybe having more mods and higher members greet newbies?
lol, that's when I came back
welcome newbies board covers that, sorta
ok read it all
14and trying to be friends with them
14instead of just greeting them
read what nao?
. . . . noooooothing: P
actually it
s
A roleplay with bjornfot and pegacorn
nononononon
and yes pegacorn it's saved
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
=D what now?
hmm...
post it on ponychan
google doc :3
noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
10This is why chat > forum when it comes to communication
I want to read it.
10Newbies need to come in here
14messaging and commenting on profiles?
14some people aren't too big on chat
It's still going on
14I wasn't for awhile
10Shoutbox
14and discussing with them on topics?
hey apokalipse
Dman Teleports into the house, copies data from his cameraphone in the corner which saw everything, and leaves the phone where it is. Dman makes the phone invisible so it can't be founc yet continue to work, and he Teleports away again
My comment ^_^
in the RP
10Yes
14Like I said, not all people are completely open to chatting or such things
lol
14A lot of people discourage for it several reasons
oh i couldn't post on ponychan!
9well enough semiporn for one night
9time for some Tomb Raider
Dman would get banned 8 <
lol
NewDCD it was good
10Usually because they're too young, which in that case they shouldn't be on the Internet at all
WAT
it was good
that game was a PSP GAME!
my god
or in a chatroom anyway
ok
14yes well
9brb
LOL TOMB RAIDER
where is this rp you speak of taking place :3
DON'T DO IT MAN!
14maybe even people might think an extremely active shoutbox might be somewhat of a chatroom too
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/original/130480823907.png mfw
#ponyrp
lol bjornfot
nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
you want others to save it and stuff too?
also pegacorn you dcd
dcd?
so only bjornfot and I have access to full thing muahahahaha
HI MAY
ALTAIR
FUCK YEAH
14since it seems a lot of members seem to use shoutbox as a chatroom since they don't like irc
14hi rhy
I have it saved in my brain
>Croft Manor
hmm
Is that the same place where you can shoot the old guy?
9so Dman
9what did you think it was?
um
i figured it was psp cuz it's what you normally do
but
it looked to be some obscure 3rd party pc japanonly game
/me sighs
9hah
7Haaaaaaaaaai, May.
especially considering what was happening lol
7*late*
9Queen's Whatever is not very obscure
i think just saying "hi" to a newbie joining this channel or on the forum on a regular basis is way to motivate them to stay
14I've been on/off Quan
yea i've actually heard of that
and heya jet
9this game actually came out really recently
14it's no problem
Hey Kosovo
Good the see you back
:D
: 0
9also fun fact: those animations were shit compared to SRW
/me rawrs at Kosoveon
hey Jet :)
7That's all right; is it life that's interrupting you? :P
7NICK. o3o
14Just saying 'hi'?
thanks jet
7Heya. :P
Hey nick
9I should stream SRW again...even if people lost interest that one time I was streaming it
o:
/me 7pokes Nick with that fic.
as in, when they log in, say "hi -so and so-"
14Nah, it's my internet
14keep disconnecting
14and going down
and doing it consistently
7Ah.
14I would think... Perhaps "Hi, so and so! How are you?"
14that would seem better to me
Kosovo
/me now belongs to Kosoveon for 16 minutes and has to fly Kosoveon around until then
You seem different
owo
you think so o-o
/me nods.
well that's kind of what I meant, May
dayum chrome crashed : /
I guess I worded it incorrectly
/me 7blinks.
/me 7is unaffected.
7Would you like me to be?
firefox.
:3
I know i know
14Oh well...
but mostly it's my laptop being eh
14I'm sorry, I didn't mean to sounds like a jerk
I prefer chrome actually
14I lack common sense so it takes me longer to process things
why wub chwome and fwiwefwox users
all else just isn't the same
http://www.ehow.com/list_7261336_side-effects-using-dove-antiperspirant.html?utm_source=outbrain&utm_medium=test11 < LOL
no no it's okay
newDCD the sound is funny
like, some noise heard in background turning on and off
Lol dat jump
I don't notice anything dman
Dat lack of swan dive.
9that's actually the game's ambience
I just made it sound like the only thing to do to make people say is merely say "hi" and that should be enough
engaging in conversation with them is much more effective
ooooh scary music
obviously XD
kind of
14Hmm
_O
Ooooh Inception music
newDCD r u srs?
that PPPFF PFFF PFFP FPFPFF

I did all the speedruns on the 360 version, I think... and all but one of the "Iron Raider" zero death achievements.

Not gonna stop now. :P
well see, newdcd, we'll see
o god the rp

so microsoft's livestream repeated sound 4 secs delayed. repeated it. so we could hear lara moan and squeal twice while running. it was like a running orgasm. HIllarious stuff, and it's on youtube.
rp? where I think it is?
/me slaps Apokalipse around a bit with a large trout.
Polarfire - yessir
but Y U slapping ppl with fishies?
*trollface*
>fall meters >onto rockface >not a single scratch was given that day

them
lol

hmm
/me nudges polarfire's shoulder in a friendly manner.
Oh you silly pony
Not even sure what IRC server this is, using the... thing
Nice jump, bro
wow looks like it's getting explicit again
*opens notepad*
*saves everything so far*
So are gameplay tips allowed on the stream, or will that make me Douchey McDouchemuffin?
RobotPinkie go for it!
I think you need to go the other way first, there are two side corridors
polarfire - what will we do with this text?
YORU VOICE :3 !!
So the moving pillar should be on the other side
/me grabs some popcorn and offers it to Dman.
I dunno.
I only have the most recent.
inb4 robotpinkie said 'i think' just to sound nonforceful but is infact a guru at this game
=]
Polarfire want tos ee what they got up to eariler?

Prince of Persia > Tomb Raider
:P

I love Prince of Persia.
and played bits of tombraider ps1
Oh yeah, PoP 2008 was awesome amirite?
They were all good.
lol, I love Prince of Persia series too XD
Warrior Within is probably my favourite though.
the emo one?
:P
Wut? Warrior Within?
Really?
The worst game in the series?
I loved that one.
hahaha
fanboys arguing is cute :3
It was easily the best.
Prince of Persia? Moar liek, Prince of Repetitiveness.
lol
Got the "less than 20 rewinds" trophy in Sands of Time :P
More graphic, darker, more interesting. :P
Quany I might have a job for you involving small images
And a billion times more emo
NewDCD - it could be said that this map has leverage over you
I like the first PoP game...
lol
mean kick was mean 8 <
7Actual pixel art or small digital art? :P
Did somebody say...
LEVERAGE?
basically
Oh that's right, you have to jump to the pillars on the side and take the hard way 'round :(
typing stuff in a small amount of pixels
so that it's readable
LEVERAGE
lol
LOOK FACE NOW, LEVERAGE, DO THIS...sir.
Heya DRF

Huh, I only know ...sir Damn me for mising out on 2 weeks

7Hmm...
well, we saw 'black dynamite' a film i highly recommend you watch
:P
7Well, there are pixel fonts.
and LOOK FACE NOW was from newdcd's first play of snatcher
we had an option to look face
so yea hahaha
On the bright side you didn't have to sit through the first 80% of Battlefield Earth.
eggonface.jpg
One of the greatest movies of all time.
7I find Minifont extremely minuscule, though some characters look odd at first glance.
12Dragoran sworeD:
basically
Sorry, I'mma let you finish
Dashite is right there
Bjornfot has no taste in games.
I want to store large amounts of formulas as images on my graphing calculator
/me hides
Says the guy who like Warrior Within
Fave game ever guys?
7o.o
Pfft.
7I see...
Command and Conquer Red Alert
Warrior Within is so awesome.
Bjornfo has no taste PERIOD.
7Well, I can give you minifont.
*Bjornfot
7Some letters look slightly strange, like S, but most are readable.
I know that feel, NewDCD bro
Your reason for disliking it is that it's "emo"? Lawl.
Dari also likes Spider's Web
7The largest characters are five-pixels tall and wide.
What flavour Doritos?
7Well, five pixels tall or wide.
The what?
Spider's Web is good because it's so random.
humble ini brundo?
can it do math symbols?
oh yea i like them
like integrals, sigma, etc
7Well, never tried it out, but I can try.
Boo-ritos. :D
BEAMS?
but what did you say? the humble indie bundle? OH steam
LIKE BEAM SABERS?
yes i now abot that
no it's fine
PEW PEW?
my volume's low, bro
I wasn't a big fan of the game ending bugs in the GC version of Warrior Within, but it's probably my favorite as far as gameplay goes.
I didn't : / sorry
Might need to take the pillar to the left instead.
I already own all the games in that bundle that I have any interest in.
Warrior Within was the most adult of all the PoP games.
I love it.
i can agree with taht, but i've only seen trailers and gameplay. but yea
7What formulae do you need? :P
And adult automatically means it's good.
Yes, bundle was amazing for money
Well I didn't say that.
I liked the arabian nights style storytelling of the first, though, I was disappointed at that going away in Warrior Within. :(
03KCUF YEAH
7(Note that I only have the remainder of today and early tomorrow before I leave for Baltimore.)

/me runz

ok ok
10!sneas
/me now belongs to Skylands for 30 minutes

I still like the first PoP game the most. Evil person puts you in dungeon. Escape in an hour.

Hey Silvermane
At least it's free.

Oooh, I know favorite game of all time. Landstalker.
Ohai SilverMane
7'Stuff' is rather vague. Especially for a topic I'm only familiar with at a very general level.
damn, didn't even get 5 seconds unnoticed.
7Could you give me the equations and notes? :P
and Tomb Raider? which one?
well
1 I think
Silvermane :3

That's correct! Great job Skylands! You now have 15010 Points.
7Hrm...
SilverMane Hey! you left the party and look what it turned into lol
Oh, don't just drop down when you come back NewDCD
7That's just around my sleeping time. D:
i can't wait for the newest one
SilverMane,you wouldn't like what's going on in the ponyRP channel
Too bad it wasn't Pinkie that spotted Silverman first.
NewDCD i said above

Spiral knights wasn't good sadly

nicholascagescreaming in the street.avi
lol ragdoll
7Hmm...
hahaha
7I could do it Monday afternoon.
OK
well
Polarfire, i had a great idea for a story because of your shippingand because 'i just met you, and i love you' make me laugh
VVVVVV ain't got nothing on AaAaaAAAa
I need to see if I can even turn bitmaps into a format my calculator understands.
if I can't, no point
but if i can pay $1 for 5 games why shouldn't I just download it for free? I mean, any multiplayer games?
7All right.
you pay the money to support them
i guess so : P
Dman you greedy bastard :p
Excuse me, I meant to say "AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!!"
I'll check when I get home
i hear the average paid price is around 23 dollars for optional-price game
giving $1 probably but i'm deciding now how much to give
if even want
03h
i don't know these games
Perfect
You can pay more later if you want.
That should work, don't keep moving
silvermane explain in pm
i don't even know these games i shoulld find out about them first
YFW I can't have a credit card yet, but still have a debit card.
pweese :3
Silvermane x Polarfire. Fund this.
lol, had to move that fucking pillar MANY times
MFW I still don't know how credit cards and debit cards are any different.
Pinkie Pie in : Party Raider, Candle of Time
Average purcahse 4.81
Yeah, now it's no problem.
/me takes a minute to draw his OC
>HUWEEEEEEEEEEE
HAHAHAHAHA
'fuck this game' bwahaha
lol
oh man NewDCD your livestreams are the best! :P
Might need to shoot down the hanging thing :P
Debit is directly linked to your bank account.
/me hugs Kitten
Credit is not.
i say 'meem
^
meem
meem
,ee,
Oh yeah
Spiritual counterpart to gene
mämä in swedish
Haha
watching humble indie bundle 3
apparently doctors recommend it
i like my debit card, i never have to pay interest!
hahaha
I haven't paid interest on my credit card either.
HAHA 'crayon physics deluxe playing with crayons has never been so physical' 'i got quite physical with my crayon last night' hahaha
Luna got pregnant by Rainbow Dash, and no rule 63 was involved!
...
Wut
Memetics was suggested by... I don't remember who... Richard Dawkins and someone else.
genes are fun
First Rainbow Dash gives everyone puberty, now this?
silvermane....
yes?
i'm still doing pre med student stuff, but I look up to you NewDCD, that's what i wanna be doing in a few years
But yeah, bring up the guns before using the grapple
well i dunno what i know and what u know
lol
do you know about glycolysis? that's a sorta indetail chunk of the course I'm doing
I think.... it's been a while :P
and ATP production
with 3 major steps?
Ooh I had to learn about ATP production this year
I remember nothing at all
glycolysis, krebs cycle, electron chain : P
Think you need to shoot down the hanging decoration, which also does something very good for you below
HAHAHA
Do you know about PMLE?
acetyl coenzyme a and stuff
yea wtf it's not gonna be used!
I know nothing of medical science...
acetyl coa is part of krebs cycle and stuff
yea filter shiz
and then there's the other spectrum...
i'm CPR, AED, and First Aid certified. for some reason
learning about life evolving over years in areas
And now you have TWO annoying pillars you need to move...
ORLY?
I used to have CPR and First Aid cert. It's been a long time though.
3 atp 1 nadh
from 3chain glucose
MFW biology. CBA - too broad.
I don't think I remember much of anything about them though.
so from a glucose that is split into 2 thats 6 atp and 1 nadh, cuz glucose has 6 C
1/4 of biology in UK is med
but most chem is med so i did that too :P
then there's GEENZ
have you learned about PMLE?
Second corridor is even more annoying, yay!
ECKS CHROMOZOUM WHY CHROMOZOUM
darp
yea they really should
I've been told you don't actually need biology A level to do medicine at university (though I'd imagine it'd make it easier)
That you can do it just with chemistry.
: P
A level - UK newdcd
like uh
44
cuz 42 but got X 4 times
incase of male ; )
Why did they update O levels, then not update A levels to go with it.
oh a magnet is a chromatid
So now A levels don't even make sense.
You've got GCSEs, then advanced level. Wut
Yes actually :P
this conversation is exhausting to read
LOOK u want me to find a pic of them?
MFW
http://networking.stemnet.org.uk/sites/default/files/imagecache/blog_image/images/genome%20fridge%20magnets.jpg
bye everypony
EXACTLY THIS!
is what i have
oh i've lived with paramedics, nurses, and surgeons my whole life
but every part splits ofc so you can move shiz around
i understand vaguely what you are saying, but it hurts

I told you about the dogs bro
Ooo, really, SilverMane?

yes bjornfot. it's a (hopefully) funny story, based loosley on stories people have written about me so far
Yo dawg, I herd you like wolves
Dat pun
oh dear
no deer, wolves
the one with a dog and a yoyo is best one
protip this makes sense
Yo dawg I herd yo and yo dawg like yo yos so we put yo dawg in a yo yo so yo can yo yo yo dawg while yo dawg yo yos, dawg
http://www.bestviral.com/i/images/306.jpg

Only Biden-approved game.

1. Load wish list with full price games.

03just do the top one
10SilverMane haha so true
7Okay. o.O
03well
03In cases where the limit fails to exist, it is possible to generalize the test using a limit superior. Let
03everything above that line.
03the stuff below it is redundant o.o
7Just that or the one above it?
7I think that's a template.
Wait what, using the horn for what now?
03wait what
the clopfic ends here, equinephiles
the rest of it is normal shipping
The fuck?
7After ...for the convergence of a series is the base series equation-thingy, right?
sure is a bad idea
7I don't need that

Everypony stopped talking
I like the thematic switches that go with the music.
RainBroDash, one worth your time probably. *preparing belt*
I can think of only one reson
A girl that has the same sleeping schedule as you?
Clearly this performance has been years in the making
She must be a brony.
10Dashite the only people with silly sleeping schedules like this are gamers.
Only reasonable explanation for this sleep schedule.
10or absurd pony fans lawl dari
03WTF, stupid Chinese companies

I might go soon.
7Well, for me, it is.

YFW tomorrow I stream more G3.5
>dari streamed G3.5?
I like the noise though.
He did.
that's just... EVIL
I suppose I could turn it off now.
Then turn it on in the morning.
yuo
Wait isn't it already the morning?
Polarfire asked for it.
:P
Nope
:3
I mean over there
Oh wait, it is morning there.
GOD DAMNIT POLARFIRE
and yes I did ask for it. Yesterday.
lol
yup dashite.
I'm pretty sure he was regreting it soon afterwards.
^
Everyone was hating me : D
i don't want to see rainbow dash dressing in style D:
I seem to recall Dari gritting his teeth and saying "No, must... make it though this..."
^
We ASKED to turn it off....
but noooo
:P
Well I couldn't turn it off once I'd started it.
meh.
That would just be Scootalooing out.
:P
I don't want to leave you guys too.
awww
:3
We <3 you to Dari
we don't want you to leave either.
BUT
you need sleep.
seriously.
How long has it been since you slept last?
Yeah. Anyone who is seriously considering playing G3.5 pony obviously needs more sleep.
Not just consider,
we did it.
Yeah, but Dari is thinking about doing it again.
wait you were there :P
nevermind XD
I was there at the start.
I forgot
28 hours since I've slept I think.
I mentioned going off to bed about 2 minutes in. I wasn't lying. :p
wow
28 hours isn't that bad...
I've lived through 40 hours
you guys know what this calls for?
Coffee?
A session of DIRT 3?
Shipping?
That I got for free?

Ohai dude

Wow.

Try me.
Lol, now I want to nkow.

but it's up on teh internet anyway lol
O_o
/me offers some to dari

/me takes a handful
I once peed in a glass and drank it.

Salty much?

12night all -.-
Lawl.

/me eats more popcorn
In fact one of my friends ending up drinking both mine and another one of my friend's piss.
...
I've tasted quiet a few different cums in my day to know that there's a big difference from person to person.
......

Not sure if serious
I am. Why wouldn't I be?
I dunno, you could be trolling. XD

12i think i just want a small copy of the card anyway
It's a swedish thingy
12i can always write out what the card does afterwards
12just so people have a general idea on what the card looks like
http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A5geldansen
12people tend to remember things easier when they can visualize it
03OK
i danced it naked, ofcourse
03so should I have my friend try to save every single xcard? XD
03-x
...
Wut

If I make the jump fine I want to try a front flip out of the window. Maybe I'll practice a while before I try that though.
lol
Go for it
go for broke and do a back flip instead
...
Lawl, I'm not crazy.
Clearly >.>
I'd need to get my technique really good before I try that.
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/53.jpg
Dari at the moment
i wouldnt try jumping out of my window because i would have to clear the rocks belo it
WHO NEEDS SLEEP ANYWAY?!
There's grass nearly directly below the window at my house.
You'd have to be amazingly stupid to manage to miss it.
lol
i would probably miss it
im just unlucky like that
The gravel is directly below the window, about 40 cm of it.
Lawl.
To land on it would be...
Very impressive.
it would happen, i would easily hit the rocks
my eyes hurt
NO FUCKINHG WAY
lolwut?

12Nevermind :3

Xeli, I swear, this guy is one of the people who are asking to be trolled
Can you hear that? :P
O_O
WUT THE FUCK
it's like 600% louder
WAT
absolute lol
MFW I realise the alarm I set for when I was getting up just went off.
XD
Are you a op there?
mfw i turned up winter wrap up so it drowns out metallica on the tv
Hahaha.
That was in PM
I was singing this because everyone was gone, then suddenly someone who's been idle for hours pops up. XD
PROFIT
and I'm not an IRC op on that network
...yet
oh deaar dari
and banning him would be power abuse as well lol
I already sang it for them once at some other point.
:P
there's only dashite at the moment :P
It was MidnightStar.
Good, turn to the dark side of power abuse!
Dashite's just AFK.
Erm, being op
:P
orly
They blackmailed me with "I'm not eating until you sing this for us".
So I ended up singing it for them.
rofl
Oh trust me, I've banned a total of 5 people from my network
wonderful
MFW it loops
Awesome.
or maybe 1-2 more
epic.
12Just say it was a ping time out ban if that makes any since ;p
2 were idiots
i can't sing for shit
nah
excuses are lame
Well nor can I.
fair
You might find out next time they organise a hunger strike. :P
i would lol so hard if you were someone I'd known before, and we eventually found out
I suppose this pretty much concludes BMN Caffeine Edition No. 4.
I'm just that awesome :p
12XD
She just kicks ass and doesnt give a sh*t
LOL
That'd be brilliant.
it's not -as- unlikely as someone like dman, since you live in reading. I know enough people from reading who've gone to my various schools over the years
haha
blah setting up a PO server with such a crap connection isn't going to work
I doubt we're further than 2 degrees of seperation away from each other on facebook
my internet is being dialup again
Haha, quite possibly. XD
06k
If that is it to be a op, i want to be one too someday, hell, i own 3 sites and 3 forums :P
Hm.
It only loops once.
That's weird.
O.o
Soipony was responsible for me streaming another G3.5 episode.
Xeli

whywouldyoudothat
Seeing as I know you have experience
12I own all of the the internetzs

He told me to. XD
Floof owning internetz
So I did.
Like a dream coming true......

Horrible G3.5 abominations eat it.

Mhuahahaha!
...actually yes it is
12Well, gotta go for now
Bye gl :3
i blame you
12Bye everyone :3
it can't not be your fault I'm afraid
can't you just change the sound balance? : /
