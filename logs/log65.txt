@cannibalmeter jenemmy
6 jenemmy is 29% cannibal. (283)
meh
The weird part is I just sucked on my arm to see if it tasted good.
I think I am gonna go sleep O:
The weirder part is that it did.
Wrists.
Are
delish'
kk :), nini <3
thanks for getting on with me!
I am now sucking on my wrist.
You really shouldn't give me ideas.
Hm, got permission from Arti to set up a PO server
You know what's fun? murder is fun.
:D
I've actually thought out elaborate plans for murdering people.
if only there was someway to combine them.....
Same here.
Even my closest friends, which is weird.
I have dozens of spots picked out to bury bodies.
I'd disassemble them.
Then I would make pie.
Lol, kidding.
Harder then you would tihnk.
I'm no cannibal.
hide the hole in a forest, and it's hard to fine the tampered soil.
it
In which they never look at
other then the fact that it's probably haunted, it works.
I know someone name mariah...
That I may or may not consider beautiful
My reasons are asually not very well thought out.
Plan: Wear gloves to school oneday during the winter
changes from time to time
hm, winter is a bad time for murder.
Be careful not to touch the palm area whilst putting them on
Trip girl down the huge stairwell with either boot or hands.
cold makes all outdoor work harder
Be sure girl is around her clique.
make it look like an accident?
Main suspects: Frenemies and other drama queens.
not much fun, but it works
Exactly.
One could easily trip the other.
also, you can't be around other murders
Wait a second.
if you become even a suspect in another murder
after "accidently
"
killing someone else
then you're guilty
Because it's fun :P
then they'd get worried.
Rule #1: Never trust anybody
it's interesting
They'll sell you down the river.
also suicide an cannibalism, and torture.
12Yay
but anyway, murder.
hm, they check the branch in accidents
they still might be able to check
needs to be a really weak branch,
If you tried hard enough, it might work.
bbl, remind me to set it up
actually
too much work and luck
not that eaborate. just the basics.
chop off limbs, using toold in my house
Hm.
put into a few trash bags
To put where?
carry/drive to the forest by the my old church
(nearby)
might take all night
*hole
ha
haha
Another plan.
Keep disassembled body parts in large hamster food bag
that would take awhile...
Hmm...
have any dogs?
Off the top of my head
No, I do not.
hamsters don't eat much
Dogs do.
having any DNA evidence around is risky shit
Exactly.
That's why cannibalism is ideal.
But, humans might not be tasty
Yeah
if you cook them right, you can stand it
I got an idea
Break and enter into someone's house
skulls aren't exactly socially acceptble in that sense
yes?
There's a lady down the driveway
her gate is usually locked
I can climb it, though
One day, while she's out
If there isn't any DNA evidence on the body
I could hide it somewhere in her home
Somewhere she'd never, ever look.
bones themselves can still be identified.
and if you're goign to hide them in somes elses house, make sure it's far
But if they aren't found in the first place...?
Yeah, you are right
I KNOW
if you can hide them that well, great.
but it would be easier to jsut bury it then
He's hollow.
D:
Take a bit off his ears, put a few hands in, put ears back on.
Re-tape package.
Then dispose of it.
Put it in the trash.
yeah
That'll get rid of some of the parts.
they don't keep records of whose trashe is whose, and the don't search it
Or wrap the body up in a rug and throw it off a bridge :P
It's okay.
Cinderblocks are the only answer!
needs weights
but it could work.

Still, I found someone with my own interest ;u;
Murder is interesting.
Murder IS interesting.
and then met in a chatroom
about ponies
BAM!
and starting talking about murder
Instafriendship.
Or some other form of contact/
I just made in a few hours ago.
I have a google+, I'm on that more
YES
I got a job!
I hate meeting interesting people and only getting to talk for one day.
Say. maybe if we both like murder, we might have other things in common too!
congratulations
and bbl
I just got an e-mail from the company I interviewed with asking if they want the job they offered.
Hmmm...
http://www.youtube.com/user/Obscurepopculture?feature=mhee
My invitation has been sent.
Oh no, thank you
I don't necessarily have one
Not in the since of drawing or painting or anything, no.
sadly.
mmmmmmmkay.
Weird.
"Transformice"
yes?
I played it for aminute and failed. I tihnk
I'm up to Chapter Five on my fanfiction of it
Thanks!
Working on chapter six
lol nice
I never did a fanfiction for anything, I'd like to sometime.
Yeah
(to make sure we don't know eachother irl)
Philadelphia.
NE Philadelphia
alright, cool. I don't know anyone there.
I'm in michigan
Is it nice there
(I don't really like that name though)
:/
D'aw
It's... alright. Either too hot or too cold all the time
Oh, I see.
Me either.
lol that's not a weird thing to say..?
All I know is South = hot.
and north is cold.
I've only been to Florida, and it is sweltering.
Here in Philly, we're having a heatwave.
it's usually cold up here, if it were either way
bleh, I hate summer.
Winter = 0-10 in extremes, 20 - 50 normally.
Spring = 50 - 70 average.
Summer = 90-110 in extremes, 70 - 90 avg.
Fall is about the same as Spring.
Now you know the weather in Pennsylvania :D
not that different
i tihnk
I like Spring alot
The jittery feeling of just getting out of school
I prefer fall
The billions of contests and raffles just before a three-month dismissal
I actually never went to school.
The weather that's just chilly enough.
Is it nice?
I've always wanted to be homeschooled.
It depends a lot on the parents
or socially inept
or just jerks
Hm.
I have heard that homeschoolers are uncivilized.
Actually there are a lot of homeschool programs throughout the hear
A lot fo them are, don't get me wrong
it's not "Better" or "worse"
it's very variable.
Yeah
Like real school
*public school.
more then a little bias, though
eh, a but harshe
You mispelled a lot
you said alot
just thought you should know,
:)
:)
Thank you for correcting me
Anyway, I agree, the english language is one of the things I care all too much about
*me.
I got obsessed when I was younger, I would look up any word I didn't know the definition too
.
lol
:)
Same
Could you say you have a favorite meme?
I really can't
They all make me gigle
*giggle
Don't you mean Carrots??
If MLP:FiM is considered a meme, then it is my favorite.
No no no...
Oh yeah
Silly me.
I know.
I am smiling tenfold more
I laugh for no reason in public
me too,
*Me too.
See?
Mine was on the television, the end of Fall Weather Friends.
My best friends quoted in around me
Good thing they brought you in
The herd is a magical place.
I asked, he told me, I was baffled, I wactched, and happiness unsued.
I mean, he's my age and likes the show
but he watched it from his younger sister, and doesn't do anything online about it
:o
I don't know if it counts if he doesn't do anytihng Pony-esc online
/me waves at Cat and where
trying to murder ponies since season 1

In the tub with Twilight
AAAAAAAAWWWWWWWW YEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAHHH
Hi ^-^, nuffin
:D
I don't know why I said that
...
(brony being used in a gender-neutural way)
I constantly find myself saying that.
I honestly cannot remember.
maybe!
May, I believe?
nice.
I just had poached egg and fried potatoes
The only episode I've seen live is the finale.
That is soon to change.
i like fried potaterz
Honestly, I just got into last month, I only watched all the eps 2-3 times
I never watcched any live or near-live
it's a bit like a much healthier fried egg
Mmm
Even repeats?
:O
I'm the youngest in my house, I'm 16 years old.
interesting
i think i'll try that
Usually on at 8:30, 1:30, and 6:30
8 and 1 are the same episodes.
look it up or something
they're quite nice
none of those times work, but that's fine. I have it all on my computer.
:D
OH! Do you know a way to download s1?
06xD
TV: My little pony~
i did :P, i'll try it for breakfast... when everyone is awake.
Like I said, I never watched it on the tv
only on my laptop
after everyone else is asleep
Well, has anyone ever heard the theme?
and no one is around to hear it
Oh.
I'm careful.
Do you think you'll ever come out of Equestria and admit it?
If asked, yes.
hooray
My parents know, they're slightly weirded out, but don't care.
I'm gonna guess at like 6am
and to my friends that have seen some of the show through younger sisters, yes
probably.
06Ascendant getting a time-out
close :P
5:22am
Hm
I even hinted to one of my friends, he didn't drill into it too much
Heh
I'm not hiding the fact that I like the show.
Yeah
No, not if it left vague
lcuky you, I wish my friends knew
I'm hoping to convert some younger sisters of girls I know.
All you have to do is ask
"when does the narwal sparkle?"
Before: You watch my little pony? -shows a bit of ticket master- This looks pretty gay. After: Rainbow Dash is my favorite pony.
To watcch
*watch
an episode.
No no, start with another episode
Exactly.
ticket master can come off as too girly
Ticket Master gave a rough start
maybe start with bridle gossip
It was the best one on demand at the time;
swarm of the century
I woke up at 9am today
at first, but it's up there.
after they see one/two
yeah, for work :p
swarm of the century shows her at her best
I know, right!
I need to write this down...
Pilots - Definitely necessary.
However, they may come off as a tad weird at first
both my parents are not at work today
But way to girly and seem weird
Some shows, it's best you watch the pilot afterwards.
Ticket Master- No way, no how.
1. Shows Applejack as a stereotypical hillbilly.
I'd say wait to watch ticket master until just before best night ever
:o wai?
Revolves around TREES.
>.>
dunno
However
which one?
also I think they're taking my grandparents to the airport to go back to spain later
I dunno.
This is a maybe
ooooo, spain
Griffon the Brush-Off
I never watched the show with someone else irl
avoid that one
This episode introduces other species
annoying characters area a bad thing to enter with
maybe avodide trixie,
and also CMC
for early episodes
I'd watch that show/
They need to ease into the horse envirronents
windter wrap-up
Trixie may come off as a recurring character in Boast Busters.
yeah, that's where they live
We don't want that.
a good episode, if the veiwer can stand the singing
Besides, little Pinkie + Fluttershy
Oh yes!
shweetness
but otherwise, it itruduces all the charctrs
etc
Precisely
A good reccomendation.
anywa
Look Before You Sleep
No Way
way too girly
too enforced morals
Hillbilly + Girly girl = Bad combo
Exactly
makes all the characters look stupid
/me must stay awake!
Mmhmm
Besides, no Fluttershy, Pinkie, or RD!
Baaddd episode for first-timers.
feeling pinkie keen?
Bridle Gossip
Bridle Gossip was nice.
I really liked it.
but it is a little girl's shpw
how long have you been awake?
Then a few hilarious changed.
*changes.
Evil Enchantress may be a bit overwhelming though.
uuuuuuuhhhh... well
Yeah
if they see at least one ep with allt he characters before that one
Lol!
20hours or something
Next, Swarm of the Century
from poinson joke
Pinkie at her fines
t
I don't watch Swarm of the Century too often.
It's one of the best, I tihnk.
I loved it.
Okay1
no singing, ntohing too girly
*Okay!
Instarec!
Winter Wrap Up.
Outsiders?
if they get passed the song, then it's good
but yeah
It ruins they episode for a newcomer.
morals are a little forved, but good jokes and a good ep
Yeah
some people like songs
I dunno
Still singing the first episode is very bad.
meh
yeah
Meh.
Meh tier.
no no no
Completely revolves around tramp stamps.
they could get too mad at the annoying characters
Plus fillies!
doesn't work with the mane cast
psudo school drama
"Bump, bump, sugarlump rump!"
lolno
bleh
NEXT
FWF
fall
weather
Fall Weather Friends
yeah
My first episode.
I think it worked well with me.
Pinkie's commentary was hilarious.
Good. may seem a little homoerotic but it works
no singing, i don't think
celestia
Moral isn't too forced.
Overall a good episode to a newcomer.
However, one thing.
Maybe not the most interesting to the newcomer,
hmm?
well,
i mean,
she is
it's an important part of the ep
okay, maybe not ideal, but can still be used early on
Yes.
Yes it can.
fuck yeah celestia.
Suited for Success.
nope.aj
Revolves around dresses.
y/n/
>NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
RARITY: D:
The End
watch ticket master > suited for success > best night ever
keep in context,
in order,
Feeling Pinkie Keen
and get all out of the way
A great episode,
proves it's not just about prancing ponies
as many think it does
Hmmm
the moral can come off badly to some people, but the jokes are good
hmm
Yeah
Scared RD is a boost
rarity is bad in that one
comes off as a total bitch
Still, all about believing in yourself
yadda yadda yadda
Wonderbolts pretty damn cool though.
and derpy
*spectacular
yell yes
and rainbow drinking pinkie
It gives you a bit of happiness.
OH!
Stare master.
FwF
Yeah?
point of 42
on the vest
Oh yeah!
And the five Bon-Bons in the background
Okay. now Stare Master
NO.
Show Stoppers.
More CMC
...
No
Yeah, no.
hm.
OH, THE SONG!
DEFINITE NO.
I'd be okay not seeing it at all
yes
Good jokes
rarity at her best
actual action
Plus Spike rocks
He is kickass in this ep
"BUT I THOUGHT YOU WANTED WHIIIINNIIINGG"
Agreed.
A yesisode
lol
ZE MGICKD
Ikr
I'd recomend it
Anna Wintour pony is best pony
but it is a little odd
wait
wait
A bit girly with the modeling, though,
I'd recomend it to the less-manly veiwer
-sigh- no.
Great episode.
-brohoof-
YES
-brohoof-
i liked it
I did too.
One problem: Song
Pinkies?
Yes, Pinkie's.
the show says the song was bad
I wouldn't worry about it
Yeah
it's a part of the joke
That's just it.
It's a good one
Plus pie that solves war.
Hilarious.
apple pie wars are good
yeah
:D
Recommend.
yes/no
I'm unsure
er, which on is that oen agian?
Philomena?
Fluttershy?
ohh
sorry i got it now
not really, it's a good epidode,
but not a good one to see early
Yeah.
Agreed.
metiocre
It just wouldn't come off too well.

CMCC?
Hmm
huh?
oh
Revolves around butt symbols.

er, fillies
bad to start with
mostly annoying episodes
Yeah
no

the ones with CMC
Owl's well that end's well.
i like it
One of my favorites.
I do too.

but i like it
Yeah

And the fact that he's her slave
Spike
Spike's nervous laugh = Instad'aaawww

early ep.

Loved.

It.
:3
<333333
Yes
Yes
YES.
The Best Night Ever.
needs some info on pinkie, but can be shown after one good ep with here
Just because
the best night ever is the last ep
They have little idea on their speculations
needs to be the last one they see
it's a good episode,
Yeah
kinda girly
THE END.
but it doesn't mastter, it's the endig
Overall, we said

Idea!
What's something you HATE?
Wanna rant about it?
hmm...
It's only me.
Besides, if it bottles up, you might release hate on a friend.
D:
No, I mean it's hard for me to tihnk of someting I actually hate
D:
Oh.
Cannot stand it.
Pushing me in directions I don't wanna go and whatnot!
lol
It makes everything 20% cooler (literally)
The End :>
Exactly 20%
:3
?
Hmmmmmmmmm
Disuss...pony?
I was hoping on talking about something else with you, since we seem to have a lot in common
Okay!
That's fine with me
I'm an expendable person.
Common interests?
Exept I'm fairly terrible at starting conversations in a non-blunt way
like any anime?
tv shows?
recent movies?
musics?
pro-kira or pro-law?
Not too much of a tv person, but I like Amazing World of Gumball, Spongebob, and Ponies
movies...
no.
WAIT
I wanna see rise of the planet of the apes!
We can talk about whatever subject you want nao.
:P
I gave you a whole bunch of ideas.
...Pro kira or pro law? (death note)
Pro-Lawliet.
A shame.
Eh
Kira is very clever.
Light is a genius.
I just find L's attention to detail and sweets charming.
Light is a genius.
Kira is not a person, it's an entity
is kira
Yes.
You are right
Childish.
Yes.
he hid his face long before he needed to.
no reason
That's exactly why I like him
man of mystery
Light wants to change the world.
He does
crime rates down by over 80%, and 90% of wards abandonded
wars
why not?
Because
Light is simply upon simple luck
*used simple twice
TAKE TWO
Light just had a stroke of luck.
02Hereee... for not long
06:3
no, he is trying to keep the world exactly the way it was
a rotten mess
Light shows no mercy, and kills every criminal in his path.
Regardless of their story
he accepted glory when it was given to him
Or reasonin
to prove a point to everyone else,
it worked
Likewise ma'am.
I'm glad we can debate with issue.
Why not?
The way to fix the world is through understanding and compromise.
there are alread issue with population
and issues with the population doing bad things
02lol, bbl
02Kthxbai
how else is he goign to change the world when his best weapon is lethel?
it made due.
At first he was sickened by the fact that he killed someone
He killed any criminal in his path
he killed all criminals to prove a point
he found it neccicary
?
A world filled with all "good" people.
These criminals are here for a reason.
?
There doesn't need to be a balence
It didn't.
Policemen would be unnecessary and thousands wuld be out of work
Continue.
there were still some crimes
like hate-crimes
things that are just sudden,
just less pre-meditated murders
less cops, yes, but we don't rely on criminals for our employment
Weren't all of those people live
Ugh
Fail grammar
sorry
?
Weren't those people killed by Light?
no, not from before
people wreestill comitting crimes
light would kill them, but he didn't stop crime
You're saying it yourself; he killed many people and crime still exists.
the reason was to keep the peace he had created
80% crime rate drop
that's a lot of crimes
Or whatever happens to him.
Immortality?
NU
it was ntohingness
nothing at all
yes, but after he stopeed killing, people starting commiting crimed again
The world was made a dirty old trashbag for a reason.
people tend to see themselves seperatly from criminals
to the point where it's "people and criminals"
Let's just end this
?
Hugs
But....
Magic
I can see that.
I read the manga.
as it was coming out
-hipster glasses=
I'm just saying
We're repeating ourselves
Nah, I get it
it ends up being a loop argument
boiling down to personal morals of if it's okay to kill
and the definition of happiness, whatnot.
Exactly
I'm glad we can agree on that.
This was fun.
That's like saying "the moon" to aliends
*aliens
There are many moons on other planets
Some may think you mean one, while another the other.
"why do you sound... nothern?" "lots of planets have a north!"
sorry, first thing I thought of.
lol
It's okay
I'm not that huge on anime, but I've seen haruhi
enjoyable, not sure if it was actually good, but i enjoyed it.
Honestly, I never watched any cartoons when I was younger
hm
Okay
7:32
Same
I stayed up all night
I need some rest
This should be interesting
having not slept
at all
okay
I keep drifting
aw
:/
:(
wrong faces
lol
if you wanted to sleep, I won't be offended or anything
I think I'm seeing things
Be here mobie ight?
hullucinations do accur during lack of sleep
*movie night

Yes

Yep

the essays were really just...ugh
I guess you could say... that I am... *sunglasses* bi-winning
the material I had to write about was the least exciting possible
YYYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH
I'm not gay.
ofcourse you're not
especially the synthesis essay
which was about locavores
6same
being gay is just as silly as being straight
6lol my synthesis essay was about whether or not we should keep the penny as a form of money
6which isn't too bad of a topic
6until you realize "crap HOW MANY PAGES do I have to write again?"
6let alone longer
but 3 or 5 paragraphs a 3 page essay does not make

isn't that the five sentence per graph thing

6yeah
hello, beautiful weather we are having.

yes.
well.
its raining : /
but if you actually do that on the ap exam
It was 105 yesterday.
they say you look like an idiot
plus about 50 to 60% humitidy.
and now its raining -.-
like "Have you ever heard of the industrial revolution?" when talking about child labor in the 1900s
where you're at
Fahrenheit?
about 85...

*instilled
oh XD
6yep
I... We are not that accustomed to hot temperatures.
yeah summers are pretty deadly where I'm at.
6thats actually why I suck at writing noe
6now
6I can't really get out of it
it sucks
hooray for ac :3
The best thing since sliced bread.
hmm
Or something like that...
is finland a lot like the us?
that's one of my favorite "sayings"
yeah
I'm not sure.
I kind of had the same probably with the history exam, but in a different way
I just thought most sayings were pretty region-specific
but I guess not.
but that's enough ramblings.
lol
because back in elementary/junior high my teachers told me when writing an claim-based history essay that it's okay to glorify whatever you're supporting
oh you silly finns
Think of Sweden, but slightly more to east
there's nothing to like about USA
but my history teacher from last year told me that was too flowery or whatever
also, you have far less muslims
the movies are pretty cool.
people would just talk about the good it did, and none of the bad
kinda
For the moment... Our immigration policies are too loose for many people's likings.
but Scandinavia is pretty well known for not liking USA
that's part of why the exam was difficult for me, because i was really only taught the good it did
HA!
barely any of the bad
Just look at Sweden.
THIS is fucking loose!
6yeah
10% of swedens population is immigrants
ja
We were once the richest country in nothern europe
gonna see if they have the 3DS charger thing at gamestop
now we're below average in europe thanks to our socialistic politics and massive immigration
6o.o
And yeah - don't repeat our mistake.
6extends?
6never heard of that lol
yeah
makes it more bulky but i honestly don't care lol
6o.o
6thats pretty legit lol
I mean, this is crazy.
The immigration problem plagues most of EU.
I have it
We don't have nearly enough jobs for those finishing school each year
The nyko one is good :3
No problem, Polarfire.
hmm
and our economy is a national low
we can't afford giving the elderly proper pension and care
despite all this
Well Scandinavian countries don't have same problems with housing as US.
Yet...
We INSIST on taking in AS MANY IMMIGRANTS AS POSSIBLE
yeah.
we're #1 most immigrant friendly in the world
Our politicians are trying to do the same here.
that would not really be a problem
the housing market over here is bad right now.
Exactly!
they are not even ALLOWED to get a job
For the first time in over a century, housing prices dropped about 25%.
here.
in 2008
because they're forced to re-take school in swedish first
It's the social welfare which draws people form poorer mostly Muslim countries to live under the wing of those working and paying taxes.
but I think Its about 20% of all homes are vacant.
no
you explain things well and you are very level-headed.
Which is why we have this problem. If you refuse taking immigrants you get stigmatized as racist.
And none wants to be racist.
we do it because we want to look "good"
hey Dman.
Hai Polarfire!
Hello
what's up?
mass immigration
Talking politics.
Not much :P
I heard about that.
hm? Colour me intrigued.

why are you asking?
it's not like they are evil
I'm wondering out loud here...
although USA wants us to think that
I don't think they are evil.

really payne
muslim extremists that is.

HI
Muslims, as far as terrorism goes.
muslim-extremists
I guess US does not have the immigration problem since there is no social welfare?
^
We do have some immigration issues.
you have a really huge dept though?
Many immigrate illegally, work for a few months, then break the law and get a free ride back to their home country.
yes we have a HUGE debt.
Well at least they work.

If you kill 1, 5 more move in to replace him and the network moves on like nothing happens.
*Well
yeah.
And yes, ponies are the best thing since AC and sliced bread.
:3
I agree with that
whoa
are you going to stream something for us? :3
at 7 PM EST
I WARN YOU THOUGH
tonight's stream
is going to be
....bizzare doesn't cut it
let's just say I lost a bet
XD
I can't wait.
Oh... Now I'm curious
We have stream tonight?
Time to stay upp till 1am
see you guys soon.
see you
it's this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BjIzYpwcEw
you've been warned
This'll be fun, won't it?
ooo, fun?
...and the Queen's Blade Characters.
yes
sure does
I'm playing though it right now, and all I can say is "Jeebus, Japan."
7 PM EST
/me grabs popcorn
...awwwww
But then I see it's from Japan
and all is explained
additionally
you might want to bring some booze
let's see how fast you get toxicosis

Hi.
its a bit sad though people make websites and protests with the sole intention of trying to insult a product or company...
you've been warned
tonight's stream might offend sensitivities
rly?
aka Wii/Kinect?
Yeah, those things. That reminds me of something I saw the other day.
actually another thing is the degradation of single player games in favour of online multiplayer. This is one thing COD I can safely say is guilty for, however the best suspect is homefront
Then I read "Kinect" and I was like "NOOOOOO"
LOL I know the one you mean
>mfw i'm wearing a SMG shirt right now
>mfw I don't have SMG
>mfw i don't have a face

I know you can pay for it.

03I've also seen those license plates that say "Amateur radio"
well more like call letters
those are assigned to them by the FCC
03no, I mean
03you know how a normal license plate is like ABC123?
03then there are ones that say things like Air Force, and let you have a 4 digit one
03etc
03you can get amateur radio ones too
I could get an amateur radio plate
I qualify for one once I start driving
03LOL you don't drive yet?

Meh, it always resets.
I have to put it on manually.

Hmm.

Oh well, winter-puff, thanks for replying ; )
no other state has anything like it
Some other IRC clients should have logging features. mIRC does.
No, trying to work out why sound isn't working, it wasn't off.

0310 seconds of end credits
03COMMERCIAL
03rest of end credits
03WHY
03it just makes editing the commercials out a bigger pain >_>
That was the entire point xD
Hey, I totally forgot about that
I'm a bad enough dude!
03Darn it
Was there any other censors on the movie? :P
03they lost some of the music
03in that
03um
03I don't know
03I doubt it
03it was TV-PG and the movie is rated PG
Yeah
03THOSE movies, I mainly wanted TV recordings for the aspect ratio
0316:9 instead of uber-wide
03XD
Except for that last movie
:P
03well yeah
03but they can prolly leave that in
03they leave it in the BTTF movies

I lost it
03LOL
03no but I mean
03why do you want to send me audio files

Oh good

9pretty much
OR watch on a weekday with us!
9my first choice would be
9Kamen Rider THE FIRST tho'
But ATA has terrible bike sfx anyway
Ofc
03what the frick is wrong with my HD Radio
HD radio o.o
03ye[/
03*yep
Is it standalone or a PCI card thing?
03it's standalone
Check the kitchen :P
stand alone
The microwave might be turned on again
03LOL
03hm
HD Radio receivers are also known as IBOC-DAB receivers
these are stand alone tuners
03and, here we go
is it working now?
03no.
03it can't find any of the HD radio signals
03hm
you would be driven nuts if you were listening to FM in central Indiana
03why>?
most stations on the dial play country
03EW
03we have like 4 stations here now that play top 40 :>
03well, 106.7 is the one I listen to the most anymore
and its the same crap that is being plugged in the charts
03and that's "adult contempary"
but EWW RAP!
03they were playing *NSYNC earlier XD
adult contemporary is a decent format
03yeah
but top 40 has gone to pot
03I quite like it
03they play rap on 106.7 too :P
sort of rare
03uh, FM is the one that's a long wire that plugs into coaxial, right?
yes
03Why the frick is it not working
but usually that does not cut it for HD Radio
03I have the wire stretched out
03it used to work fine
I had that problem back in Washington
the HD Radio signals around me were weak with the exception of 104.3
03WHAT THE HECK
03It's not even working with *analog* FM radio
the antenna connector
03uh
03no it's not
03hm
check it
03do you suppose rabbit ears would work?
03how?
does the connector wiggle considerably?
03nope
03it's been plugged in for like a year
03just sitting on the shelf
try unpluging the radio and pluging it back in
03hm
they run custom firmware and have issues from time to time
03alright let me try
HD Radio receivers are actually SDR sets usually
SDR meaning software defined radio
but their demodulator settings cannot be changed by the end user
03heh
03I wish I could just stream dump HD radio
03even if i have to convert it to something
you can't
PAC
03imagine if you have a computer card that just saves it as PCM
03PAC?
actually no not PAC
HDC
High Definition Coding
03yeah I've heard of HDC
its a proprietary codec developed by Ibiquity
PAC is Perceptual Audio Coding
that is used for satellite radio
03THERE we go
03thanks that worked
03just unplugging it and plugging it in
no problem
03not sure why it needed that
that is the first thing to tru
03guess because I haven't used it a year?
*try
03or more
03and see
might be a microprocessor burp
as I call them
03I know it's proprietary but I mean
03say you had one of the decoders
03rather than outputting as analog
03if it output as PCM
03to a computer
03:P
03*output
03so in theory, I could do something similar
9Everything's set up
9last warning, fillies: this is going to be a mindfuck in more ways than one
I hope your'es till here with dem buttonz in an hour
Just to sorta check it out first. some questions might be too obvoius / hard
03fail
03I'm taping this antenna to my ceiling and I dropped the role of tape down the stairs
03stupid wire is like 10 feet long
you had the right idea trying to elevate it
03Yeah
03I'm not stupid :P
that usually helps
03I just wish I could stick a PCI card into my computer and dump HD radio to something
rabbit ears would help a bit more though
03that's just stupid
but STAY AWAY FROM THE AMPLIFIED ONES!
those can introduce noise into the RF signal and reduce the signal to noise ratio that the decoder is seeing
resulting in drop outs
those provide a good deal of gain but they are passive
no amplifiers
thus no noise introduced
03alright, there we go
03I only really need to record a few songs off of 106.7 and then I can put the HD radio back away for a year XD
I don't use mine all that much for over the air FM
heeello?
the Delco might get more use
03hm
03what is RDS?
03It switched from RDS to HD
03once it found a signal
Radio Data System
03o.o
03what's that actually mean?
9also invite whomever doesn't value their sanity, as always
i am ready
03Darn it
Sadly no i can't =[ But I can't wait to read reactions!
03106.7 has crappy HD radio reception
Isn't RDS quite rare in NA?
its text data mostly including some aditional bits which can be used for among other things traffic information
not anymore
its becoming more and more common
RDS is the comeback kid on FM
03http://i.imgur.com/Ogo8s.jpg
RDS is very, very popular in Europe (or at least something similar to RDS).
03had a great 4-bar signal for 95.5 but 106.7 basically doesn't have a HD radio signal at all
(At least in Germany.)
it actually is RDS
(Last time I went, I was in a wonderfully boring Opel Astra, the radio had the ability to break into a music CD with traffic reports. Using RDS. :P )
that meant a radio station was transmitting the traffic flag
WB SKY
10Thanks
a bit indicating traffic information being sent out by a radio station
yes
its a tacky setup
in more ways than one
03should I move the two ends closer together?
03or does that nolt really matter
03*not
move them further apart if anything
9five minutes
03hm
03in English please
=D
03and yeah, 1067.7 has *no* HD radio signal now x.x
well the whole antenna you want to be in a T shape
03so take the one end and make it cross the other?
no
...
No.
no
03x.x
because its been years since I used an FM dipole
Let me get a link.

03ah
yes
03OK
Yes, the angle between them should be 180.
9we're live
(And with the feedline perpendicular to that.)
I hear you
I hear you
03That worked.
03Nice.
03I get a 4 bar signal again
03now I just need to finish taping it
/me drums along

BEEWBS

I think getting this setup is a cause for celebration
Everclear's AM Radio
7Oh.
There is 1 AM radio channel here in Teverola xD
7Did she state anything specifically?
D=
I'm going to try but I can't guarantee anything because it's quite a difficult app
7Hmm.

Well, I'm going to do it in javascript
Or if that fails, VB or java
WELL.
7Flash?
credits are up soon i shall see. seriously wtf is this
._________________.
7No? :P
7All right.
I could try that /if/ I can't do the others
7Well, thank you. :)
Of course not lol.
7Though we actually need bits and pieces of birds to customize. :P
ugh KIRO
good :3
another infamous blah blah blah talk station
Mmmhmmmm
my favorite up there was KYCW 1090
I'm more concerned about the coding for the time being
the images can't be that hard
7All right.
7Nope.
His voice annoys me, most high pitched voices do.
I'll most like just cut out outlines
IDK why he liked 710 KIRO
not to mention MUSIC!
I do like KIRO 7 news, though
9ladies and gentlemen...chances of clothes ripping: high as fuck
9luckily, it didn't happen
They did a good job, TV news >>>>>>>>>>>>>> radio news
oh lol
even where I was I got good reception of them on just a Walkman
look THAT one up
Ok
its a very unique
little receiver
Hmmm
Interesting
KGHO 920, KLOG 1490, KYCW 1090, KKSN 1520, and KPBC 1640
;p
all during the day
7Well, actuallly...
Haha, KLOG
7In those sorts of tools, you have some sort of already-designed base which you just edit parts.
that is a real one
its in Longview WA
Hi Obsi
their logo even said this for a while
"KLOG 1490 AM STEREO"
xD
*wonders if he could've gotten KLOG from Kitsap County*
Did you live in WA before?
yep
Toledo WA
you would not have heard KLOG from Kitsap County
it was in Cowlitz County
i'm about to press play
Too many Toledos
Toledo, Ohio
Toledo, Spain
Toledo Oregon
AND Toledo, Washington
yep
Oh, ok
you would have been able to hear KGHO 920 and KYCW 1090 in Kitsap County
KGHO was oldies back then
It's like he sings in the bathroom.
Hmm
that is a nice one
This page is in Spanish. Would you like to translate it?
probably
else I can do some CSS code for it
wat?
Apparently it was Seattle's only oldies FM station after 97.3 changed to news
yea
I HATED that
Yeah
97.3 switching to talk
-moz-opacity works fine, alpha/opacity for IE does not
News Talk 97.3 = The talk you don't want to hear from 710, only clearer
KYCW 1090 switching to talk royally ticked me off
Hi Luna
same with KGHO 920
I much prefer good music to talk
7If there are alternate ways of doing that, that'd help. :P
I remember their top of the hour ID to this day
sorry guys

9let's continue our descent into madness, then
9Jenemmy: you don't want to know
Yes I do.
I wish I could listen to a little bit of American radio
Is it hentai or frightening?
most people think AM just has crappy telephone quality mono
I like the Italian radio here, but it's different
9that should tell you everything you need
Seems boring.
FM could sound bad too in an area with poor reception
exactly
Like Seabeck :P
AKA where I was
you should have tried it
it was craptastic
Or the area before you reach Leavenworth
No radio at all
except on AM
I think there were about 3 AM stations, and only 1 was coherant
also, any suggestions for mods on PO? @ Quan
especially at night
just going to ask whether anyone wants to mod it
because ionosphere FTW!
Yup
which doesn't mean i'm going to actually mod them though lol
actually shortwave works there too
Seeing as I know he's used PO with me before
I remember listening to the BBC up there
They have BBC radio in WA?
ok i playe'd and am now here! : D
just over shortwave
Oh
I was hearing it from a site in Assencian Island
What's shortwave?
in the Atlantic
basically bands between 3 and 30 MHz
9you haven't seen nothing yet
Ok
there are broadcast bands in this range where stations can cover entire continents with ease
Wow
Call PETA
7@ NS/
Call RSPCA
I used to hear NHK's external broadcasts direct from Japan over shortwave
That's amazing
I can even here
9JAPANESE MARMADUKE MUST DIE
Dang
>DAT UP THE SKIRT SHOT ok
9>wield dual handguns
That's far away

even in this day and age a twist of the dial can take you around the world
9AWW SHIT

CRUSH!
9there you go
WTF
ok i got that much
9I told you.
ever heard of DRM?
I could see if it was possible for me to get 95.7 xD

But I'll set it up tonight hopefully

Aww

where is this rp you speak of taking place :3
DON'T DO IT MAN!
14maybe even people might think an extremely active shoutbox might be somewhat of a chatroom too

#ponyrp
nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
HI MAY
FUCK YEAH
14since it seems a lot of members seem to use shoutbox as a chatroom since they don't like irc
14hi rhy
I have it saved in my brain
>Croft Manor
hmm
9so Dman
9what did you think it was?
um
but
/me sighs
9hah
7Haaaaaaaaaai, May.
7*late*
9Queen's Whatever is not very obscure
14I've been on/off Quan
yea i've actually heard of that
14it's no problem
Hey Kosovo
Good the see you back
:D
: 0
9also fun fact: those animations were shit compared to SRW
14Just saying 'hi'?
7Heya. :P
Hey nick
9I should stream SRW again...even if people lost interest that one time I was streaming it
o:
/me 7pokes Nick with that fic.
as in, when they log in, say "hi -so and so-"
14keep disconnecting
14and going down
and doing it consistently
7Ah.
Kosovo
You seem different
owo
/me nods.
I guess I worded it incorrectly
/me 7blinks.
/me 7is unaffected.
7Would you like me to be?
:3
I know i know
14Oh well...
but mostly it's my laptop being eh
all else just isn't the same
http://www.ehow.com/list_7261336_side-effects-using-dove-antiperspirant.html?utm_source=outbrain&utm_medium=test11 < LOL
no no it's okay
like, some noise heard in background turning on and off
9that's actually the game's ambience
I just made it sound like the only thing to do to make people say is merely say "hi" and that should be enough
engaging in conversation with them is much more effective
ooooh scary music
kind of
14Hmm
_O
Ooooh Inception music
that PPPFF PFFF PFFP FPFPFF
i hear it : /

played first 2 hours of sands of time
and played bits of tombraider ps1
Oh yeah, PoP 2008 was awesome amirite?
They were all good.
Warrior Within is probably my favourite though.
the emo one?
:P
Wut? Warrior Within?
Really?
I loved that one.
hahaha
fanboys arguing is cute :3
It was easily the best.
lol
Got the "less than 20 rewinds" trophy in Sands of Time :P
More graphic, darker, more interesting. :P
And a billion times more emo
lol
mean kick was mean 8 <
Did somebody say...
LEVERAGE?

we had an option to look face
eggonface.jpg
One of the greatest movies of all time.
7I find Minifont extremely minuscule, though some characters look odd at first glance.
12Dragoran sworeD:
basically
Sorry, I'mma let you finish
I want to store large amounts of formulas as images on my graphing calculator
/me hides
7o.o
Pfft.
7I see...
Bjornfo has no taste PERIOD.
7Well, I can give you minifont.

yes i now abot that
no it's fine
PEW PEW?
I didn't : / sorry
Might need to take the pillar to the left instead.
I already own all the games in that bundle that I have any interest in.
Warrior Within was the most adult of all the PoP games.
i can agree with taht, but i've only seen trailers and gameplay. but yea
7What formulae do you need? :P
And adult automatically means it's good.
Yes, bundle was amazing for money
Well I didn't say that.
I liked the arabian nights style storytelling of the first, though, I was disappointed at that going away in Warrior Within. :(
03KCUF YEAH
7(Note that I only have the remainder of today and early tomorrow before I leave for Baltimore.)

I need to see if I can even turn bitmaps into a format my calculator understands.

7All right.

Dman you greedy bastard :p
Excuse me, I meant to say "AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!!"
I'll check when I get home
giving $1 probably but i'm deciding now how much to give
if even want

You can pay more later if you want.
That should work, don't keep moving

That'd be brilliant.
it's not -as- unlikely as someone like dman, since you live in reading. I know enough people from reading who've gone to my various schools over the years

Haha, quite possibly. XD
