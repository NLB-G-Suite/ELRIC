?
I've got it open.
i've got a link here somewhere
I didn't read it.
hahaha
read it sometime
No one walked in on my reading the other fics out loud.
XD
Which was good.
http://pastebin.com/n9fViXf0 - it's really nsfw of course
it's called the rerapening
02Should I fell guilty? XD
Dari, loving the pagan battle metal?
Does this smell like clorophorme to you?(lol Nash reference)
This is SOOOOOOOOOOOO AWESOME.
told ya mayn
Clop clop clop
now for a sick cover by them
olololololol

I got Chaotic Evil
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3gkit21XM
Oh, then i can guess mine
02No one saw that one comming NS xD
Harro
):
06When most people hear of chaotic evil they fail to realize that it can come from just being for pure freedom in a no-matter-what way lol
*chloroform
Xeli
the wording of the philosophies does make it sound surreal though
and very unrealistic
anyway
epic song time
if you know the song
I wanna be a evil scienentist! With a cool beard, in a underground laberatory
06lol
And work with lasers!
honestly, by their wording, I'm more of a "Chaotic Good" or "Chaotic Neutral"
rather than "Chaotic Evil"
RAAWRR
06well isn't it always?
wait till the chorus if you don't know it, you might get it
imo good/evil doesn't really exist
I made that clear in Reminiscence and TCTL lol
No idea man.
FUCK DARI
FUCKS SAKE
I know this song.Just not the metal version.
lol
if I had to define evil/good
I'd say evil is just opposing how the world wants to be lol
good is agreeing with society
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvDMlk3kSYg
that's the song
:<
Yeah.
Lawl.
Depens on wich society...
Which society do you think I mean? :p
and accordion
Those catholics?
*runs
yea
06and religion I guess but lol
lol religion

I ate my birth candle
And i went natural
:D
and yes, Xeli

it's hard to gain my trust
02^
I usually say "Trust is a bridge that is easy to break but hard to build"
06I assume the best but if people screw up it takes a lot to get back on my good side
^
I'm more of a pessimist ;p
METALSHY
Or
06Well then we're two, even though I always say I'm a realist more than anything.
Ffin keyboard >>
06And people always go RRUH NO YOU'RE A PESSIMIST
06It's like the people thinking that pansexuality = bisexuality lol
yeah same, I'm more of a realist
lolwut
Lol?
and I'm a lot more blunt
06YOU'RE OKAY WITH BOTH GENDERS? OK YOU'RE BI THEN
Morons and homophobes, they be!
I think....
06I'd go into explaining the difference but it's not really needed xD
and heh, I usually don't assume the best
/me hides
Very quickly, but I give it time :p
lmfao
other request again.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiCCWQWoknM
06When I say assume the best I do not mean I think everyone is a saint
play after ok?
:)
:D
You forgot retard
;D
06I guess a more correct way to say it is that I assume nothing until otherwise is proven :P
nah, that'd lessen the insult
06Read between the li- no that makes no sense
brb
lmao
XD
06But it's really amusing the things people think are insults and they throw around
ok i'm back
lol I was kidding :p
but seriously, people actually get offended by that
One sec, need to help at deck, going under a bridge

10Nah indigo is a tertiary colour

10the rainbow is made up of all the secondary colours, but one tertiary was added to appease the church
10TECHNICALLY there are near infinite colours in the rainbow if you want to be pedantic
10but the classical rainbow should have 6 colours not 7
Actually, the rainbow is made up of the three primary and three secondary colors
10except, lolchristianity ruining things again
10yeah yeah, i meant it doesn't extend -past- secondary colours :3 ofc the primaries are in there too >.>
10so really the rainbow has yellow-green, and yellow-yellow-green, and yellow-yellow-yellow-green in it too, but that's just pointless

10that's because the secondaries are made from mixing two primaries D: they form on the border between two primaries
10or rather, they have a wavelength between the midpoints of the two primaries
10and that's how equestria was made.

O___o Wow.
that's pretty cool
10mfw I'm not really that bothered about sites like that, but grats getting something done that could lead to more exposure :3
Yeah! I used to check it more, but I've weaned off since ponies
especially after memebase banned ponies for a few weeks
Yeah, I noticed that
then we got our own section out of nowhere
Some people were getting really mad
lol
I can't go more than 5 minutes without thinking about ponies.
lol
me too
pshh...I NEVER stop thinking with ponies
:/
Whenever I begin to think about a topic for my college essay, ponies keeps comming into my mind
lol
Not sure how they would react to that
I'm doing a presentation on ponies in college
I know that much
8-10 minutes long
If I decide to write my admissions essay, I'll post it somewhere
8-10 minutes for ponies isnt long!
Plus you have a captive audience!
/me evil grin
lol
it's not long, it's short...so much to say
What's the presentation supposed to be on? I saw a good one on physics
the physics one is great...mine is just a standard "talk about something you know a lot about"
it's for my college's Ambassador Program
ooh
there's only like 15 of us in the whole school
:O

O.o
03RDS =Radio Data system
03as in
yep
03there's data going through the air whether you want it to or not >:O
03well mine's from 2000
even factory ones
03and I totally didn't realize it
03yeah, this is a factory one
its by no means a recent thing at all
*lol'd more than i should have*
03XD
03well
quite a discovery huh
03I'm surprised that it still works
03like
03it works though, just kinda annoyingly as it's usually one word per line
03due to... the thing being LCD
not both
lol
GAh
03AM doesn't have RDS, does it?
03*anything
lol
actually yes it does
i cant help it
but its called AMSS
:P
03is it standards complaint though?
03OK
03*compliant
for Amplitude Modulation Signaling System
03not complaint XD
yes it is
03well not with "RDS"
totally different than RDS
and not used much
03my car's AM radio sucks though
which is a given
03I mean, the large antenna that sticks up where the hood is is only for FM, right? I think AM needs a loop antenna?
its used for both AM and FM
03granted, my mom's minivan has the antenna built into the back window, and it has such crappy receptionm
03I prefer my 2000 SUV where the antenna's like 3 feet long and sticks up XD
I hate that design
03yeah
03it's more sleek but the reception SUCKS

03hm

03hm?
03what do you mean by wiring harnes
03s
03well isn't the only plugs like the speakers, and then the steering wheel controls?
03plus power I guess
something like that
03so then why do you need a harness?
03got a picture of one?
not off hand
they are factory equipped only
mine I got for just $1
03factory equipped only?
it means installed at the factory
03they don't make aftermarket ones that hav eit?
03http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/ctps.png?w=500&h=190
but RDS, yes
03well
early 2000s are the newest ones
03hm
03would that be too old to have an AUX input to plug a 1/8" headphone plug into? :/
yes
03darn it
03forget that then

and being stalked?
how does this gaymeter work
It's only natural. I mean, you can't be this awesome and not have everyone like you.
4Yeah, and stalked
it takes time, questing is invaluble too
hey dari, did you sleep?

The stalkers are a little creepy though.
: D
how long?
And shipping you with just about everything
/me shrugs.
12and my combat skills
12the only combat skill i have in the highscores is strength
12which is 80
soooo.....kinky pie?
lol
lol
I have near 80 in all combat skills
4Yeah, that too. Have you heard Renard's "Rainbow Dash Likes Girls" song?
nah
not yet
but summoning requires mugo money
that's old
12i only have 7 skills in hiscores
;_;
4Hey, I still like that song though
4Even if I don't listen to it nearly as much as I did.
I haven't heard that song yet.

Polarfire: Not even sure.
lol

Welp, hard drive transfer is finished.
prepare for ear murder http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcjso2HmQqo
That's near 200b exp
or was that 200m exp
and Either ear murder or ear worms
:)
4And Elision, I still like that song
but it is kind of ear rapey
and music
4Hmm, that came out wrong
oh well thats different
4Yeah, I think that's a more accurate way to put it
WUT!
12i know

>_>
lool
12either way frey
12it's unbarable
yeah lol
12it still irritates me that the halfway point is like 92
Yep
12for experience in the usual 99 skills
4And *YOU* SoiPony, I dare you to do it again
That could be turned into a case of acciddental innuendo
oh man listening to this with my good headphones is awesome
13.5 million exp
:)
no
is 99
I'm not getting banned
again
can I slap you :3
>: D
It'll go by a lot faster.
but then it'll return and keep my interest again I expect
*:O*
12i can't kill anything special
Why are you guys hitting each other with fish? O.o
4ClockworkPie, I'd be most appreciative if you'd refrain from slapping me. That's a bad route to go
12heck
kay :D
12i'm too afraid to even go into the wilderness
Odds are you won't kill anything special until you're in the 90s :P
I still struggle
Widly is pvp now
12i know
/me is shocked
Which I hate
12which is why i won't go in there

4Brony RP?
#BronyRP
4that must not be SilverShipper
12i went in there all the time when it wasn't pvp anymore
12because i loved to explore

Calculus is hard x.x
0only reason i want bwushables
that's the plan, yup
0too much sugar in her blood :P
8i would rather have a regular toy than a brushable tbh
aw, but hairstyling :3
8i mean regular as in non-brushable
kinda want both, but i'd rather make dresses for brushables.
0but you can't condishun and comb normal ones :3
0that's the basic plan
7D wake up :p
8i dont really want to brush them all that much though
0if too much hair, gotta keep it well
Want the fully molded ones on top of my TV in a neat row. :3
I don't want any of the toys. IMO toy made for cartoons always look bad
also: dman. >MFW I've been thinking for about an hour straight about how dishevelled my hair is today :3
They kinda failed on the Fluttershy though, it looks like :(
0lul had shower yet?
yeah, after my shower :<
my hair's getting long. I'm thinking about cutting it
0after shower?
0y u no shape it when wet?
i did!
But it went crazy
when it dried
naturally curly hair?
I don't have curly hair really no
I'd call it straight hair
0rainbrodash u no doin it rite :P
Oh it's worth it, especially if they don't even ask if you want it wrapped.
That alone should be worth $5 :P

0my hair's longer :P
0well, a little longer. prince-dari's seen me IRL
14K, I'm going with that then
lol that's pretty much the length of my hair right now. Time for a haircut this month, though.
probably like 12 and a half
0oh i see
0oh dear
I prefer cycling to running
0failciety
lol I prefer to just take walks
running is overrated
0runs far more fun
0especially if freeruns :P
to be honest I needed to change my eating habits. No amount of exercise would change that.
If I can lose weight by eating right, I'm doing it right.
yeah, that's usually how it is
0rainbrodash
0it's like 20% eating 80% work
0unless you diet/starve
0inwhich case its 40/60
I've been dieting. But dieting is really subjective to be fair
I used to eat like 2-3people's worth of food. Now I don't :P
Pats
:3
Dieting is a bad idea though.
Hey
I'm on my iPod, I'm babysitting somebody
0it's easy to eat the right food if you're distracted with anything
0but exercise is hard work. i'm too lazy sometimes :P
