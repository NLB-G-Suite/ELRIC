I don't care to be honest. I do some stupid shit in places like this

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFW6IE0yWGs

and -try- to get volume up plox
:3

wtf
just watch
It's all about the Scotish pirate metal though.
nope
linux mint, but my connection is crap
it is.
but this is also amazing dude
dat violin
Linux, not big suprise
just wait till it breaks down into metal
dat epic finger speed
you should see him impersonating herman li
dat metal
he takes the piss out of him on stage and does a violin herman li solo with a wah wah pedal
HOLY SHIT. AWESOME. OH MY GOD.
fucking told you. dari you're me 2 years ago
it's like the rerapening all over again
(read that fic,it's funny shit)
?
I've got it open.
i've got a link here somewhere
06Why am I not really surprised that the alignment test gave me true neutral? |D
I didn't read it.
hahaha
......what fic?
read it sometime
No one walked in on my reading the other fics out loud.
XD
Which was good.
http://pastebin.com/n9fViXf0 - it's really nsfw of course
it's called the rerapening
also, google autocorrected me to 'reopening'
02LOL I got Neutral Evil
NOPE GOOGLE
02Should I fell guilty? XD
Dari, loving the pagan battle metal?
Does this smell like clorophorme to you?(lol Nash reference)
This is SOOOOOOOOOOOO AWESOME.
told ya mayn
Clop clop clop
now for a sick cover by them
Alignment test?
olololololol
06This test is a proper one though and treats alignments how it should - not making "evil" equal to "stomping kittens" and "good" equal to "taking a bullet for ANYONE"
MFW RBD makes me download music.
blah
Ray
I got Chaotic Evil
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3gkit21XM
Oh, then i can guess mine
in this one he mocks herman li
02No one saw that one comming NS xD
Harro
):
oh no, this is after he mocks herman
06When most people hear of chaotic evil they fail to realize that it can come from just being for pure freedom in a no-matter-what way lol
Now tell all your friends, Harmon Ri is coo, or I shit on your head.
*chloroform
Xeli
06not being some kind of evil scientist
the wording of the philosophies does make it sound surreal though
and very unrealistic
anyway
epic song time
if you know the song
I love you so much
I wanna be a evil scienentist! With a cool beard, in a underground laberatory
06lol
And work with lasers!
honestly, by their wording, I'm more of a "Chaotic Good" or "Chaotic Neutral"
rather than "Chaotic Evil"
"Now tell all your friends, Harmon Ri is coo, or I shit on your head." i love that video
tbqh all of this good/evil stuff is flawed
RAAWRR
06well isn't it always?
duh :p
wait till the chorus if you don't know it, you might get it
06unless people actually back it up I almost instantly look at their arguement in another light if they use the term "evil"
RA RA RASPUTIN
imo good/evil doesn't really exist
06SPOILER: Not in a better light!
I made that clear in Reminiscence and TCTL lol
No idea man.
FUCK DARI
FUCKS SAKE
I know this song.Just not the metal version.
lol
if I had to define evil/good
I'd say evil is just opposing how the world wants to be lol
good is agreeing with society
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvDMlk3kSYg
that's the song
see pegacorn knows it
:<
Yeah.
Lawl.
Depens on wich society...
so much better with violins and real guitar
Which society do you think I mean? :p
and accordion
Those catholics?
*runs
06and that is of course flawed too, those words just need to be kept out of anything but philosophy and ideologies almost xD
yea
06and religion I guess but lol
CoB Oops I did it again for the lulz.
lol religion
^
I respect people who are part of a religion but I'm going to make it clear that I think it's stupid
I ate my birth candle
And i went natural
:D
and yes, Xeli
>my best mate has played this every day I've been at his house
06"Are you kidding me? The government can't even pave roads." I did like that one xD
Lol. XD
that's 9 days in the last 14
........I shall request something now.
Ahahaha.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZLJZY5jMXE
02LOL
Yeah same
XD
02That answer was awesome.
I chose that one :p
play it after ok?
Sure.
02I HAD to pick it xD
anyway everypony, going away so i can get home
Ok.
ill be back online when i get to my own house
Honestly, it's similar to what I think
MFW where's my iPod gone?
02^ also that
bjornfort's read end
rear
FUCK
SPELLING
Wait wait wait
God damn it.
I trust in very few and have faith in nothing
>bjornfoooooorrrrrrrrrt
more than you do :p
baibai
06It's totally true too
?
out of everyone I know IRL I think there's only one person that I can say that I legitly trust
* runs
Drake?
that person is the Hensh, and Drake doesn't count
06lol
:P
on the internet, the only people I completely trust are Xeli, Drake, Altair, Sneas, Shiny and Skylands
02lol
*hm
and,BAM.
Good list
AVENGED SEVENFOLD
I've known nearly all of them for most of my internet life anyway :p
except for Sneas, but he's behind but half a year
A7x is win.
NIGHTMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARE!
I have a few too, going to meet 2 of them oo
heh
IT'S YOUR FUCKIN' NIGHTMARE!
Ray and Patrick.c
:D
it's hard to gain my trust
02^
^^
I usually say "Trust is a bridge that is easy to break but hard to build"
02But my funfact is: It's harder to gain my trust IRL .-.
06I assume the best but if people screw up it takes a lot to get back on my good side
^
I'm more of a pessimist ;p
METALSHY
Or
06Well then we're two, even though I always say I'm a realist more than anything.
Ffin keyboard >>
06And people always go RRUH NO YOU'RE A PESSIMIST
06It's like the people thinking that pansexuality = bisexuality lol
yeah same, I'm more of a realist
lolwut
Lol?
and I'm a lot more blunt
06YOU'RE OKAY WITH BOTH GENDERS? OK YOU'RE BI THEN
Morons and homophobes, they be!
I think....
06I'd go into explaining the difference but it's not really needed xD
and heh, I usually don't assume the best
I can usually tell whether the person in question is an idiot or not
06Well if I was like that you would never get to know me, so don't complain :)
/me hides
Very quickly, but I give it time :p
lmfao
other request again.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiCCWQWoknM
Guile theme with a fight scene wins.
dear god the way I acted 3 years ago
06When I say assume the best I do not mean I think everyone is a saint
play after ok?
Dusky you're an idiot, a moron and a useless pile of words
:)
:D
You forgot retard
;D
06I guess a more correct way to say it is that I assume nothing until otherwise is proven :P
nah, that'd lessen the insult
06Read between the li- no that makes no sense
brb
lmao
XD
06But it's really amusing the things people think are insults and they throw around
ok i'm back
lol I was kidding :p
but seriously, people actually get offended by that
One sec, need to help at deck, going under a bridge
I know people who have ragequit when I told them that lol
it's from the Cinema Snob's review of "Riki-Oh:The Story of Ricky".
06I love playing games online with a friend of mine who's gay, he REALLY knows how to handle the children going YOU KILLED ME YOU'RE SO GAY RRUH
/me hides
the original song was "The Jet Set" by Alphaville BTW.
lmfao
06Yeah
06It inspired me
xD
06now my response to that is just "Yes, so what?"
Back
you've influenced me so much:p
And LOL
+space
06Even though I'm not gay, but it makes them shut up :P
I remember wolfhome and "trolling" it
06it trolls itself anyway
dat obvious stunt double
06but yes
more like overusing zalgo, beeing unfunny and stupidifying myself
I read that as trolling <censored>

Do you want the link again?
Pegacorn - nah i tried it out

i'll just do it at some point
......
ok
but bear this in mind: i'm in madrid and i'm actually moving to Granada in south, i'm here in madrid till monday. everything is still packed 'cept for my laptop
I think I'll go to Toys R Us, check if they have any pony.
but it's september the official UK merch date
TO YOUR LEVERAGE-STATIONS EVERYPONY!
if they have in stock, they released ahead of Hasbro's wishes, but if they have WIN buy buy buy
Alright, September?
Yea, that's 'officia;l' date
You're in Madrid? What a boss
Lol =)
There's about 5 apartments here, and between all 5 if you imagine all 5 in a sort of circle with roads around them, theres a pool
a free pool

POOL'S CLOSED.

You ruined the surprise RBD.

What surprise?
0_o
Oh sorry pegacorn
Notice,in the picture,every player is Rainbow Dash.I was playing with two of my friends in multiplayer.
www.rulesoftheinternet.com
10dari ffs
10either way
10I want ponies.
10fund it
It was in skylands.
10"<RainBroDash2>: BUY ME PONIES FOR MY BIRTHDAY "
10also inb4 RainBroDash3 steals my voice
that's the surprise?
Orly
There isn't one now.
But,the thing is,only I was actually Rainbow Dash in that game.
It was ruined.
10Rainbows
I forgot about that
: (
10Hack the Planet
but all the ponies look like Rainbow Dash, Pegacorn
profit
I think the guy on the cliff was Nanosuit 2.0,and the guy with the chicken is the default guy
The thing is,when i use a skin,every player becomes me.
But that pic was taken a while ago.I'm now Dr.Nefarious in Minecraft.
And i have a new texture pack too.The one in the pic is a "MGS:VR Training" inspired texture pack.
oh, minecraft issues
: [
Heya Kosovo
I now have "Coterie Craft" as a texture pack.The sun has sunglasses,the moon is Nyan Cat,the rain is skittles,among others.
Come on that should have worked
hi
0_o haha
well this is interesting
apparently, nintendo is cutting the price of the 3DS down to $169 on August 12 O_O
Sun is all like:"Deal with it"
Deal.
10duhderp :P
and the people that bought it before that price cut are getting 20 free downloadable games, 10 of which aren't gonna be available for people who bought a 3DS after that dater
-r
that's pretty awesome if you ask me
I also have the "Last Days" texture pack,but i'm not using it right now.It's a "Fallout" inspired texture pack.

/me found this out through IGN
@Funmeter Minecraft
6 Minecraft is 53% Fun. (343)
And before i was Dr.Nefarious,i was DJ-PON3.
Oh dear.
Okay I am sorry for all that connecting and disconnecting, I'll stop now
I'm getting bored again.
But HELLO
dr nefarious is way too easy in R&C 3
waaaaay too easy
compared to other bosses from other games
Klunk is really hard in Secret Agent Clank.
I mean,Battletoads level hard.
haven't played that game
but i've heard
Battletoads?
bbl, need more rest x.x
And I haven't slept for 39 hours nows.
i want to beat it one day, as it's not even that much
i know i can go more
it was when i flew from amercia to portugal to england
and 'slept' in portugal overnight
Little sleep + boredom = I decide things that I'd normally think are crazy are fun and perfectly safe.
'slept' here meaning 'played phoenix wright all night'
Ah, very long flight?
Price-dari sounds about right!
And then the REM hallucinations kick in!
:P
Heya Ray
I did this during school once, and I saw pink flowers on the whiteboard
Pheonix Wright,a game i never played,and probably never will.
it was SO REAL
Hello everyone
REM is awesome.
02Hiya Hyper :3
10Hi Temi
02Also Hi RunningPies .-.
REM Semi-conscious, due to sleep deprivation/insomnia, is awesome awesome
I saw a lion statue that i walk past every day MOVE on the way home

I'm not that surprised though.
I never remember any of my dreams.

SPIDERMAN IS CREDIT TO TEAM!

Thank you
MFW I haven't remembered a dream in over a year.
=[
Kind of sucks.
The last dream i had was like 2 years ago.Since then,i saw the future instead of dreaming.
But meh.
you need either LOADS of sleep, or BARELY any sleep. these are the two ways to remember dreams
lol pegacorn
I'm serious.

MFW now I have a 2 TB and a working 1 TB drive.
I know.
I'll convert the clip into a GIF.
wait, you have a 2 terra-byte drive?
Eeyup
Where else am I gunna put my porn?
I thought the largest was giga-byte
Nope
2GB drives aren't too bad. Tend to be more for storage not speed though.
I wonder how long it takes for me to fill up 3TB of pony.
Also, Dari, you keep your porn in the cloud.
Dashite: Upload times. Meh
I have a memory size of 222 gigs
...what is going on in here
well, that's the hard drive size, anyway
Dari is talking about his porn collection
nice
Eeyup.
3TB of pony penetration
LOL
PONY PENETRATION
PONY PENETRATION
How many times did we get DCD to say that? XD
How many memes have we created?
MFW converted 4 second GIF is 23 MB.
Wut
O.o
Resolution?
I dunno.
Are you using some kind of website?
Eeyup, too lazy to DL software.
:I
That's a large gif...
Plus it was only a 4 second clip.
prince, i am disappoint
So I thouht it wouldn't be that big.
Clearly I thought wrong.
depends on compression, duh
>MFW I'm no longer talking about files
Dari can't handle big objects?
Oh sure I can. I can handle more than most people need to now.
...ba-dum tsh?
Whee!
My shower has tile now!
10HAHAHA FUKKEN SAVED
LOL
MFW the original clip was only 545 kb and the converter turned it into a 21 MB GIF.

10Nah indigo is a tertiary colour
0,14I7t8'3s 9n11o4t 7m8y 3f9a11u4l7t 8i3f 9y11o4u 7c8a3n9'11t 4s7e8e 3a9l11l 4t7h8e 3c9o11l4o7u8r3s9.
10the rainbow is made up of all the secondary colours, but one tertiary was added to appease the church
10TECHNICALLY there are near infinite colours in the rainbow if you want to be pedantic
10but the classical rainbow should have 6 colours not 7
Actually, the rainbow is made up of the three primary and three secondary colors
10yeah yeah, i meant it doesn't extend -past- secondary colours :3 ofc the primaries are in there too >.>
Red Blue and Yellow are the primary, orange green and violet are secondary
10yarp, and indigo is just green-violet. like orange is red-yellow
10so really the rainbow has yellow-green, and yellow-yellow-green, and yellow-yellow-yellow-green in it too, but that's just pointless
0,14:7p
Did you notice that the way the colors are set up, each primary is separated by a secondary?
0,14I7n8t3e9r11e4s7t8i3n9g11. 4C7o8l3o9u11r 4t7e8x3t 9i11n4t7e8r3f9e11r4s 7w8i3t9h 11e4m7o8t3i9c11o4n7s8.
Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet
10that's because the secondaries are made from mixing two primaries D: they form on the border between two primaries
10or rather, they have a wavelength between the midpoints of the two primaries
ah
10and thus refract less or more than the primary, so are above/below in a rainbow
10and that's how equestria was made.
Oh, dashite, interfer isn't a word.
the red wavy line means it's a typo
you were missing an "e"
10ohlol

ah
Oh, I have an announcement!
?
On June 26, I emailed the Cheezburger Customer Service for memebase and ICHC. I asked them to consider adding a brony section to memebase. I listed a few reasons, but expected no reply. They gave me a case number a day later, but I still did not expect much. A few days later, to my surprise I received a nice response from Chelsea, Katrina, and Emily
(the rep team) saying how great it was that I was trying to improve the website and they said that they would pass the idea on. I figured that would be the last I would hear of it and went away on vacation for three weeks O.O.
Since I came back I’ve barely checked memebase, but yesterday I noticed a new section for bronies. I checked the day of the first post and realized that it was July 1st. I think that the date stamp is wrong as the first reply to the picture is July 21, which would also explain why I had not noticed the new section before. Coincidence? Maybe. Awesome? Yes
O___o Wow.
that's pretty cool
10mfw I'm not really that bothered about sites like that, but grats getting something done that could lead to more exposure :3
Yeah! I used to check it more, but I've weaned off since ponies
especially after memebase banned ponies for a few weeks
Yeah, I noticed that
then we got our own section out of nowhere
MFW I hear a song on TV that I've seen before in a PMV and my mind whiplashes back to ponies
Some people were getting really mad
lol
I can't go more than 5 minutes without thinking about ponies.
lol
me too
pshh...I NEVER stop thinking with ponies
:/
Whenever I begin to think about a topic for my college essay, ponies keeps comming into my mind
lol
Not sure how they would react to that
What has MLP done to me...?
I'm doing a presentation on ponies in college
I know that much
Video it!
and MLP has made your life awesome dari
I will
8-10 minutes long
If I decide to write my admissions essay, I'll post it somewhere
mfw talking to adults about MLP for that long...
8-10 minutes for ponies isnt long!
Plus you have a captive audience!
/me evil grin
lol
it's not long, it's short...so much to say
What's the presentation supposed to be on? I saw a good one on physics
the physics one is great...mine is just a standard "talk about something you know a lot about"
it's for my college's Ambassador Program
Well that's pretty general
ooh
there's only like 15 of us in the whole school

My nick colour rule doesn't highlight the face silverscreen.
fake*
I'm NewDCD
Oh RBD, can you remind me how to kick just in case?
I seem to have forgotten
/me 10waits 1 minute for NewDCD to get nickchanged for not identifying a registered nick
lol
12yeah it's you D:
Anyone see NewDCD for awhile?
10lol RDash can i ask one thing
10was there anything that indicated it was RBD who kicked you?
O.o
10or did all signs point to fakesilverscreenmod?
Yeah, it says RainBroDash
10FFFFFF
oh, no
10oh, lol
I just did whois
11oh hai
11im silverscreen

Too late
/me begins kicking screen. Doesn't work
11i said no point
11innit :3
10so, operation 'make RBD's smartphone work as a USB webcam' failed
Here, both you and RBD type at the same time!
10wat?
Try typing at the same time as Silverscreen
11i am typing
interesting, your name didn't highlight when I typed it
11oh, and i derped hard and closed the RBD tab
Lol
back
herp
10derp
Derp
11merp
11i wonder if i can kick me or ban me
so I see dari isn't done lol
o.o
11hahaha
11well that entertained me for a few minutes
10now back to boredom
haha
10sorry about those kicks
oh boy, possible derpy toy in the works at hasbro
10i did genuinely want to test out the limits of that disguising nick business
Hmm, am I banned?
10dman didn't come back, i feel really bad now :S
10no?
That was me
Xd
XD
10WHAT
10BUT YOU
hahaha
lol
and NewDCD
10so you couldn't tell it was RBD when silverscreen kicked you, as dman?
10yeah well i thought NewDCD was fucking Dman
10cock
10XD
XD
lol
Well, I knew you were RBD, but I dont think there was any indication
10of course
10i wanted you to know it was me
10I don't want silverscreen in trouble lol
10but I also wanted to be an ultra ninja
Haha
10btw, a good magician always reveals his secrets, you on mibbit?
10rdash? D:
I've never heard that saying before
;) but yep, the one embeded
10the saying is the opposite
10a good magician never reveals his tricks
10but yeah, look in the names sidebar
I know
10the silverscreen has a capital I instead of an L :<
ahhh
10thats why the whois failed
It didnt
10O.o
I just click on the name and click whois
10hahaha
Muahaha
10>makes sense to do
yep
10jolly good show old chap
The reason that I asked if I was banned was because I tried logging on with Bjornfort a few minutes ago and it said "You are banned from the channel #bronystate"
10Loooooooooooooooooool
Is bjornfort banned then?
10i forgot bjornfort is still banned XD
I thought it went by host name lol
10DCD banned by nick
hahaha
ooh
10you can ban by nick, hostname, client, or a mix and match of all 3
10afaik.

That was mean. Someone posted the doors to equestria, but didn't give us a date!
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/07/behind-these-doors.html
lol
Russet just tweeted a pic from inside the doors
can't see anything though lol
oh lol sibelius 7 is outr
Yup. I saw the guy who made the original post with that picture before it went up on EqD.
The monitors are too bright to see what's on them!
eeeyep
That office looks like it needs more ponies
it's too epic for a single camera to capture :p
I hope that it live up to our expectations! Especially since the people working on it have set our expectations..
according to the person tht took the pic of the doors, S2 is living up to the hype
and I'd believe it
Yeah, I read that
they have a great formula already
they know what's working and what we like
Yep, they have a huge foundation to make it a great show
more Luna, just sayin
I don't think that Hasbro is too involved which is a good thing
06:3
Gives the writers more creative space
my face when pony socks become canon in S2
Luna better have socks in an episode!
I hope so...that'd be so cute
I would die
a happy death

BUT...Past SIns already passed it in votes...
back to my fan fics, I'm working on a MLP/LoZ: WW crossover
:( why
YES
Cause I is hungry.
OH LORD YES
xD
;-;
And there's no snaks at all.

I take it you two would read it if I posted it here?
would*
yup
yep
im not a snack link is one
oh god rarity is hitting on 'elusive'
xD
This is brilliant and scarily scarily in character :D
But link is crunchy.
I'm still deciding if I should have the ponies go anthro upon crossing over or not
Various metalic objects.
But no matter what, they will keep some pony features
if not all
Just waiting for Twilight and Dusk to meet now.
I just can't imagine the six ponies travelling the Great Sea as ponies
hm
Dashite i'm still halfway into part 5
anthro twilight sparkle and dash in the WW universe
Barry - unicorns control boat?
sign me up!
phaps?
;-;
I read chapter 5 in between classes yesterday. >_>
>every temple done by mane ponies.
YES
and Link
lol, i'm reading it now dashite
Link will be inn the st0ory
make him silent?
lol
I'll try
yea it will be hard
'sup neighas
but if done rite it will be awesome
hey again RobotPinkie!
yeah
so epic
12back
Though I make no guarantees, since Termina's Last Twilight has a Link that can talk
though he doesn't do it often
eh i'll just read it then :P
ah
have him speak
with SIGN LANGUAGE
problem solved
HAHAHA
that would be amazing!
make link mute
lol
so he has to communicate through acting and noises by banging stuff together etc
But he's not mute in Wind Waker
it's an idea
Yea, i know
but thats the point
He said C'mon
wb
says*
to make it lol / tru to game, make him not say like anything much
yeah
maybe a word or 2 :P
Well he can say "HYAH"
and "WAAAA"
yeahp
like C'mon when beckoning the stone statues
Not the most eloquent protagonist I've seen, exactly.
i remember that barry, it was very :3
lol
This makes me wonder how much Link will speak in Skyward Sword
Gordan Freeman is
Oh that's true, I forgot about the "c'mon"
hopefully nm, barry
:3
I want him to speak through a hand puppet
mfw Link is voiced by morgan freeman in skyward sword
just because
Pinkamena style
what? I thought it was always a Japanese guy who voiced Link
...
lol, that would be funny
Who nickalerted me
meh obv
morgan doing the usual link grunts and yells

i like to pester you :o
I'd buy it

I don't have a Wii... :(
D:
Don't really want one except for Mario Galaxy and the Zelda games.

Wii U looks pretty awesome, though.
I am looking forward to SS more than any other game this year
Robotpinkie wat
metroid trilogy!
MW3...just saying
10o.o
:/
Yes yes that's in my top 5
but not no.1, bro
not no. 1
10WHAT IS THIS
but... but... gimped Metroid Prime 1&2
xD
implying that's bad?
MW3, BF3, Skyrim, SS, Saints Row 3
nah i see your point there
i had never played the gamecube ones so yea
Kinda want the 3rd one, though
mario galgaxy 1 and 2 are insane thou
its the best song on MSR
also, red steel 2. dat controls
10The breathing

/me listens to Portal 2 soundtrack
Also, what is this SS?
Skyward Sword
Ah
bro, zelda game
: )
12fffffff
12power went out :/
quote from miyamoto 'if this isn't our best zelda by a longshot, we may stop the zelda franchise'
lol
quote from meyamoto a few days later 'i think this is the best zelda by a longshot'
this is all true, i promise you.
Really loved Fatal Frame 1-3, almost wrote a whole guide for Crimson Butterfly.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FRHsTLgKSY "WOO" "UH!"
XD
:P i am excite
I think this is the first time I've seen someone refer to it using the acronym.
ah
Dashite - big zelda fans already call it SS, but i guess only really zelda fans did, not other people
Also, Metroid Prime 1+2 on Wii are still damn fine games.
Did you know that Wind Waker was meant to have a few more dungeons than it did?
eyup
I try to acrony-ify everything
yes barry
lolwut
like only 2 or 3 'proper' dungeons
still loved that game
Meh, maybe I'll get a Wii for SS, it's cheap now.
10Link, just... no
/me 10calls it SS. RBD also hates the fucking Wii and wishes they'd do it for the pissing gamecube instead
YES
;D
Yeah, in fact, the original plans didn't have the triforce gathering event at all
/me does the WOO UH!@

rainbrodash ;( ok
Gamecube is still working perfectly. I still replay WW from time to time.
lol
in fact, in 2012, the Wii will have an upgrade called the Wii U
yfw gamecube uses ATI and wii uses SAME ATI but dual and Wii U uses SAME ATI but tricore
I've got my Wii for gamecube games.
this is true guys
and Ocarina of Time, got the limited edition WW, w00t!

Rarity best pony? O.o
I really want someone to do a Luna PMV using gODHEAD - The Reckoning

Pinkie has the most awesome dresses to sew.

Hence: Pinkie is best pony, unambiguously
Are you tied behind Twilight RDash?
Fluttershy and Rainbow are 'tied together' for first

Yes
bleargh
I hope not.
There's something you should know about me. I specialise in a very specific type of pony favoritism. Changing favoritism.

03etc
03seems silly to actually label them and have little metal terminals for unused fuses o.o

because there's less chance of you losing them if they're already in there

03affect on powertrain components.

I heard about a guy who sued an RV company because he got up and made a sandwich while driving
03LOL
the owner's manual didn't say not to
so he won :V

03THANKS A LOT
03:|
12is dead
12has been
12-.-
12ever since the McDonalds coffee incident
it's not that, it's just common sense is a null term in law
03XD
03well
03class is over
03bbl
12meaning it's dead
03but I should be home the normal time

03:<
03Of course you do
03anyway
03bye
12it's decomposed
12:|
People are better than people give credit, but the bad ones pull humanity down.
I'm sure that most people wouldn't drink gasoline, but it's the worst who would, and they're given protection because they can't be liable because they don't know better.
12tho if one of us "better people" does something wrong, the law pulls up that "ignorance is no excuse" :3
o.o
because it's generally stated somewhere not to do those things because someone before you has done one of those things.
Oh LL

Cuz he's mah father
"All's quiet on the western front"
03I just turned it on on my drive home and it was very primitively showing what song was playing on any given station XD
O.o
12wbs Danny
03RDS =Radio Data system
03as in
yep
03there's data going through the air whether you want it to or not >:O
many car radios have that
03well mine's from 2000
even factory ones
03and I totally didn't realize it
03yeah, this is a factory one
its by no means a recent thing at all
*lol'd more than i should have*
03XD
03well
quite a discovery huh
03I'm surprised that it still works
03like
03you'd think with all the new radios, 11 year old single-line LCD displays wouldn't be able to properly parse the data
03it works though, just kinda annoyingly as it's usually one word per line
03due to... the thing being LCD
03as in, what a clock uses
it seems for car radios you could either have AM stereo or RDS in factory units
not both
lol
WHY IS THAT SO FUNNY
GAh
03AM doesn't have RDS, does it?
03at least in the car I have it didn't show anyhting
03*anything
lol
actually yes it does
i cant help it
but its called AMSS
:P
03is it standards complaint though?
03OK
03*compliant
for Amplitude Modulation Signaling System
03not complaint XD
yes it is
03well not with "RDS"
nope
totally different than RDS
and not used much
03well either way my car doesn't support it
03my car's AM radio sucks though
which is a given
03I mean, the large antenna that sticks up where the hood is is only for FM, right? I think AM needs a loop antenna?
its used for both AM and FM
03granted, my mom's minivan has the antenna built into the back window, and it has such crappy receptionm
03I prefer my 2000 SUV where the antenna's like 3 feet long and sticks up XD
I hate that design
03yeah
03it's more sleek but the reception SUCKS
those glazed in glass antennas suck BIG TIME

03even on very strong radio stations like we have in Detroit
03it was turning to static every few feet when I was going slowly
speaking of Detroit radio stations
yep I can get WJR
I was trying for them
03XD
there was a recording of WJR 760 in stereo from a Delco UX-1 AM stereo/FM stereo car radio online but its disappeared
03hm
03well
03would I need entirely new stereo equipment in my car or could I just get one of those ones that costs like $100, take out the old one and plug the new one into where that was?
you can get a new car stereo
but you need a wiring harness to connect it to your factory wiring
03hm?
for after market car stereos
03what do you mean by wiring harnes
03s
these plugs that connect to the stereo
03well isn't the only plugs like the speakers, and then the steering wheel controls?
03plus power I guess
something like that
03so then why do you need a harness?
03can't you just plug thoes wires into the new ones?
sort of an adapter to hook up after market car stereos
03got a picture of one?
not off hand
03well how much are car stereos that do AM stereo and RDS and all that stuff?
they are factory equipped only
mine I got for just $1
03factory equipped only?
it means installed at the factory
03they don't make aftermarket ones that hav eit?
not AM stereo
03http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/ctps.png?w=500&h=190
but RDS, yes
03well duh, mine is factory default and it has RDS
03well
03how new are the AM stereo ones?
early 2000s are the newest ones
03hm
the one I have is from August 1990
03would that be too old to have an AUX input to plug a 1/8" headphone plug into? :/
yes
03darn it
03forget that then
03I never listen to AM anyway
I do quite regularly
03well right now I have to use a casette tape adapter to listen to my mp3 player in the car
especially since FM out here sucks big time
03as mine just has AM/FM, a CD player, kand a tape player
03FM is pretty prevalent in Detroit
poor programing choices
its mostly country
03EW COUNTRY
and just EWW MODERN COUNTRY
03we only have one country station and I avoid it like the plague
03though I find their callsign funny
03WYCD
nothing older than 2005
03then we have WDVD
03What is it with the tech names? XD
03what's next, WWMA?
I have no idea
03(I know you can't have MP3 so yeah"
03or WAAC
03WCDR?
03WBDR?
or animal names
Saracuse NY had WOLF
03no, I was just pointing out how we have a WDVD and then a WYCD
that is wild
03?
Seattle has KING and KONG
03...LOL
I kid you not
look those two up
03I believe yo
03u
brb
03also you know what I don't get, my HD radio is way bassheavy
03even though it doesn't have an equalizer in the hardware
might have to do with frequency response in the case of the speakers
03I'm talking about my computer
03when I record it
03it sounds like someone used bass boost and recorded it that way
yawn

RainBroDash, you can stay in teh cage once you are done recording, but only if you are a good boy.
Is that really -the- RainBroDash?
Like.. the original one from ponychan in like.. January?
SilverMane I've been a good boy all evening ;_;
Guess it's not.
The original wouldn't have ignored me blatantly like that. :p
he's on a differnet channel
uuhm.. Looks like he's in this one. #bronystate.
i told him to come over
you can be on multiple channels at once, he'll come back ot this one in a sec
he's signed on to this channel, but his attention is elsewhere.
I know that. I'm connecting through mirc.
10tis indeed the real RBD
inb4 SilverMane becomes a mod
10and I am truly sorry for missing your message
(please?)
10SilverMane, is that nick registered?

Oh~
This could get confusing, in mah head.
10I know. It sucks that we have the same name.
10back to what i was doing for one moment :3
4In any case, I just scrolled back up and noticed you were looking for me, Star?
don't think about that, just look in wonder at my splendor! For i am the one, and ONLY, SILVERMANE! *trixie special effects*
because my ego isn't inflated enough on here
10SilverMane

Well.
Actually you were looking for me.

But short of like..
WELL SHIT!
Abusing certain things, this is the only way I know how.

and being stalked?
how does this gaymeter work
then all my other skills started to rise

It's only natural. I mean, you can't be this awesome and not have everyone like you.

it takes time, questing is invaluble too

The stalkers are a little creepy though.
my daddy is so cool :D
Eeyup
Yay.
: D
12i guess swiftkit doesn't say your combat level anymore
how long?
And shipping you with just about everything
/me shrugs.
you should ask silvermane about what he just wrote about you
12and my combat skills
I never used SK
And that stuff needs to stop.
12the only combat skill i have in the highscores is strength
12which is 80
soooo.....kinky pie?
lol
I mean really, a cloud? What the hay?!
lol
I have near 80 in all combat skills
4Yeah, that too. Have you heard Renard's "Rainbow Dash Likes Girls" song?
nah
save summoning
not yet
but summoning requires mugo money
that's old
12i only have 7 skills in hiscores
that's one of like eight songs by him I like incidentally
;_;
4Hey, I still like that song though
You'll like dungeoneering btw
SilverMane wrote something about me? O.o I'm not sure what to think about that yet...
That's better than Pinkie. I heard she was shipped with a battleship once
true, it is good
4Even if I don't listen to it nearly as much as I did.
I haven't heard that song yet.
12i have a friend who is still obsessed with runescape
12he has like 80 dungeoneering
Polarfire: Not even sure.
lol
4Truth be told, I think I'm beginning to fade from the FiM love
Dungeoneering goes up to level 126 :|
D:
wut ghosties
D:
Welp, hard drive transfer is finished.
The first season is good, but it gets old
prepare for ear murder http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcjso2HmQqo
That's near 200b exp
or was that 200m exp
and Either ear murder or ear worms
:)
4Well, I mean, when you don't have new eps every Friday, it's hard to continue wanting to love the show
4And Elision, I still like that song
I do too Ghosties
thats harsh Ghosties
that's what fan fiction and art are for
but it is kind of ear rapey
and music
4Hmm, that came out wrong
4I still love the show...I think I'm losing interest
/me slaps ghosties
oh well thats different
4Yeah, I think that's a more accurate way to put it
WUT!
Having to wait until late fall early winter kind of kills your enthusiasm
What the hay is this?!
12i know
561 new messages in BMN Skype chat?
4>_O NIGGER, WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU JUST DO?!
YOU SERIOUS GUYS?
YOU SERIOUS?
...
>_>
lool
/me slaps ghosties around a bit with a large trout.
12either way frey
12it's unbarable
yeah lol
12it still irritates me that the halfway point is like 92
Yep
12for experience in the usual 99 skills
Eeyup.
4And *YOU* SoiPony, I dare you to do it again
That could be turned into a case of acciddental innuendo
oh man listening to this with my good headphones is awesome
13.5 million exp
:)
no
is 99
I'm not getting banned
again
4Hmph, that's what I thought...
/me slaps Ghosties around a bit with a large trout
can I slap you :3
>: D
Ghosties: yeah I'm gonna run out of fan steam before too too long
But think about what you're killing at level 92 vs level 1.
Ghosties WHAT?! losing. Interest?!?
It'll go by a lot faster.
but then it'll return and keep my interest again I expect
*:O*
12i can't kill anything special
Why are you guys hitting each other with fish? O.o
besides bronydom is based on fan content rather than the show really
4ClockworkPie, I'd be most appreciative if you'd refrain from slapping me. That's a bad route to go
I have all 26 MLP: FiM episodes recorded, but I haven't watched them in forever
12heck
4And yes, RDash, losing interest
kay :D
12i'm too afraid to even go into the wilderness
Odds are you won't kill anything special until you're in the 90s :P
I still struggle
Widly is pvp now
hey ghosties... *trollface* join brony RP a minute.... you know, for the lulz...
12i know
/me is shocked
4Oh god

4Oh boy, what frontiers has the most degraded individuals of the Brony Movie Night spawned?
D:
4*inhales*

4I have to keep my rep up, man
4You know how it is
true true
it's ok honey ;_; we all make mistakes
4;)
>mfw I'm so awesome at being awkward
>_<
Don't you guys get sore, being kicked so often?
4That's how all this shit goes
4If you're bros, you constantly make homosexual references to one another
yep
who does?
\kick Ghosties
4Though, personally, I'd love it if we didn't do that. Cuz I'm a softy and shit
wait...I'm lost
It's not working!
4You're doing it wrong, RDash
Obviously.
If I do it the right way, it dissappears
"/"
4It just won't show up for the rest of us because you don't have the clearance to kick me
that's the idea...
its more funny to talk this way :3
lol
4I see you guys playing Spiral Knights pretty often now. Is it any fun?
You guys are getting boring now. I'm outta here.
Ghosties eeyup
yeah
by daddy!
lol
So, did anyone watch the video I posted?
SMH
tell mommy I <3 her
lol?
4Later, Dash
Oh my GOD, why did you guys have to talk so much.
lol
It's what we do?
4OH MY GOD, WHY ARE YOU HERE?
ouch
As soon as I finally go to sleep GOD DAMN MOD ORGY IN SKYPE.
4He can take it
Ghosties dear, why you so mean?
4He is the damn system, after all. It's not like he feels emotions or anything
lol
dari isnt real?
4It's an injoke between us mods
@realmeter Dari
6 Dari is 54% real. (485)
I'm the chat room.

@fictionmeter Harry the Bear

4In the earliest days of the BMN, dari used to hang out around the stream long after everyone left. At first, I called him the hobo of BMN but then when he became a mod and started making some awesome tech changes and stuff for us, we concluded that he's not a hobo.../he's the goddamn system itself/
lol
lol
cool story
4Thanks
@sexymeter Rainbow Dash
6Rainbow Dash is 0% sexy.

@sexymeter RDash
6RDash is 14% sexy.

lol
XD
great stories
huh
Then you let Sprinkles be God for a while.
4Sometimes they'd leave the chat
COLOURS ARE FOR YOUR GODS!
@godmodemeter Ghosties
4Yeah, then I let Sprinkles be God for a while
6 Ghosties is 41% godmode. (489)

Eeyup

Hmm
I learn more new stuff about IRC every day.
Well I could stream something now.
Like I didn't know channels didn't exist until someone joins it.
:D
good idea
Yeah, though you still have to register a channel to make things like the access list, topic, bans, excepts, etc persistent. ;)
Since the file transfer is finished.
hooray
ah.
12laa
And you just do that through epic-chat?

hey guys
:(
6hello
It seems pretty big to me
hey guys
also my wii is still on Sonic 4 at E.G.G. Station Zone
XD
Whaddup!
When we get the 300 or so people from BMN that's something like 10 times as many people are as normally on.
wow.
Hey.
I didn't realize that.
how long has epic-chat been around?
Not sure of the date it started many years ago though.
so what time is it by you?
ah.
ohai flutterhi
If you check /list even now #bronystate is still the biggest channel.
With just 14 users.
6:48 am
hey guys
Hey.
heyyyyyy
ooh'
ohai
im very new to here. how is this brony movie night?
wow.
any good?
Movie night hasn't started yet. :P
i know im asking how the whole thing is. in general.
It's great, though on Friday stream we usually have up to 300 people.
So the chat can be a bit fast.
pretty good :) I mean full of awesome bronies
chat is impossible.
oh damn.
Some people prefer the Saturday stream which has more like 50-100 people.
Its a blast, but as far as talking...
Id love to buy popcorn and chat with some people while watching mlp.
As it's easier to talk.
nope :P
Knock knock
its friday here now ;P
Who's there?
Interrupting cow
Interrupting cow who?
sure.. I'll take the free popcorn
It doesn't work right here
But the first film isn't for another 17 hours I think.
The interrupting meme thing won't work right here
Though we usually have a prestream before that.
question? Im extremely bored and wanted to meet up with a brony.
Is there any brony meetups anywhere?
or some site i could meetup with bronies..
I dunno, where do you live?
US?
all my freinds seem... not to like ponies.
Australia! D::::
check equestria daily.
Hmm.
oh.
well I'd love to meet up w/ u
I've not seen Australia meets, though there is a map somewhere.
but australia is an ocean away for me
Where you can put your location.
:(
And see if any other bronies have put their location near yours.
i have met a group of bronies before but they were unmagic
Unfortunately I don't remember where this is.
half of them didnt watch the show.
and they were sadness.
So...How were they bronies?
Knock knock
the freindship... was unmagic...
Who's there?
Banana
Banana who?
Knock knock
Wut
It's the joke
12i'm sure no one here is interested in even looking at my tcg review XD
omygod
uuuugh
MFW I don't understand your joke?
dari its a stupid US thing.
Ohh.
When someone answers Who's there with Banana, you can expect them to0 continue the knock knock joke with the same words ad i9nfinitum
It's joke-ception.
infinitum*
My freind seems to think Giggle at the ghosty sounds like....
What's "Banana".
giggle at the...
Goatse..
until they say Orange
So it could literally go on forever
Crack up at the creepy. Yeah, it all fits Dashie.
LOL
or until one loses interest
joke-ception
lol
Haha dashite.
also idk if ill play OoT tonight
brb
pretty much, Polarfire
It's just a while statement IRL.
What do you get when you cross an elephant with a bee?

Do I really want to know?
I need MOTIVATION .-.

I got really prepared for tonight's caffeine edition.
In fact, the times I'm funniest are when it's purely accidental
o hey bane
HIIIIIIIIIII
Hi, Bane
hello

Ok.
Question

inb4 someone pesters link
/me shot
;3
It's not happened to me, but has anyone ever experienced a humilation conga?
humiliation*
what is?
a what?
how does it differ from a regular conga
1) Dig a hole. 2) Place peanuts in hole. 3) Cover peanuts with ashes. 4) Wait for elephant. 5) Kick the elephant in the ash-hole. 6) *groan*
This time I don't even need to ask.
I know I don't want to nkow.
know*
It's when you experience a series pf humiliating events
no...
of*
I like Dashite's explanation better
so that just became my reality
Dashite: damn.
I guess it's kind of hard to set one of those up
I just gotta say. Damn.
I MIGHT play OoT tomorrow
I am
>>
DARI
I HEARD YOU
I R
dammit
You're welcome Polarfire.
I made up a song while I was reading silver's shipping fantasy

Dude, you scared the cupcakes out of me. I was reading something and then I heard a loud breath
apparently my sound was all the way up o.o
lol
idk
XD

plus its 2 in the morning
it depends on me being willing to play it ;p
hahahaha
Same here, RDash
breathing becomes so much scarier after 12
yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
Yea! East coast ftw
first, some potatoes for energy even though I'm just sitting here. Then I drank a cup of coffee. But the coffee was too hot and left an aftertaste so I drank a mountain dew.
I'm ready.
How fast was Rainbow Dash going to punch those holes in the clouds?
At the speed of awesome.
XD
This sounds like a good song for Super Sonic somehow
I love the sonic rainboom episode
i'm back
No way
I know this
This was one of the first pony vids I watched.
I think it was before I even started the show.
Sonic CD
yup
Mine was "Open up Mr mailbox. Its time for your breakfast"
hahahahahaha
Somehow that kept me interested for more XD
My very very first... was the return of derpy one.
I like that one video
rainbows move at the speed of light... and rainbow dash moves faster then that therefore awesome
Why Pinkie pie paused for so long
I was hooked on that little clip.
I can't remember what I was searching for though.
I can't remember where I placed my sanity
I know I found it on 4chan (the ONLY good thing 4chan has ever done for me)
and I thought wtfits
I didn't even realize it was a show, or that it had a following.
So I clicked on the thread...
originally I thought it was part of an elaborate 4chan troll
and it was all rule 34 -.-
MFW 4chan >_>
MFW I've never been
:)
I was on 4chan for a week.
stop putting MFW before everything
MFW No

So If I were to set up my own IRC server, I would have to put the appropriate software on it... And register a domain? then create a chanel and go from there?

You don't NEED to register a domain
It's nice though.
12:<

/me *saw
Depends.
12well don't have to but still
You can get free .cc.co domains.
.co.cc*
derpy hooves lol
Like the bronystate.co.cc site
And the bronyserv.co.cc IRC server.
I have a friend who thinks derpy hooves undermines the entire show
That we aren't using I just set it up for if we ever need one.

hey dari will you read me a story :3
I'm pretty sure you already did.
That was from last night D:
or was it?
oh that one XD
sure go ahead
link to follow along?
:3
oh shoot
>mfw there's a forum that i haven't been to in literally years
I just realized I never read past the beginning on this one D:
o-o
uh what do you mean, Umbreon?
well maybe not plural but still
12oh nothing
12i can figure it out myself
._.
noooo don't do it D:
I'm not too strict on anything
make up rules as you go, best admin ever :3
/me run
lmao
I do that here
12well
12if i make a tcg article
12i would like to reference other tcg communities
12but i don't want to be ban hammered for advertising lol
eh, at least it isn't like my minecraft adminning, where everyone can do whatever the fuck they want, oh and everyone has op too
then again it was a community server for a fairly close-knit community
this one guy though i swear
he just obtained TNT asap if he got op
which is why he didn't get op
Noooo D:
but yeah that server kinda died
not for lack of interest but lack of updating on the hosting service's part
dat context
D:
filly rape is terrble
Gah
Is anybody still here?
here
Umbreon you think I'm a moderator ):
12no
there's no rule against that lol
12i think you are an admin
lol Zoroark
well... down to 3.
XD
12which was why i opened up the convo with that question
12instead of cutting right to the cheese
dari?
yeah pretty long...
and yup.
you.
;o
:3
hmm.... I don't remember anything from last night's caffeine edition.
link?
Zoroark: Add kick on TNT placement
That's what we did
Unless u are an admin or have permissions
what?
what is it?
what???
speak man!
SPEAK
ah
hmm...
what do you suspect dari?
well I have my suspicions...
By Razyn
PTS, it was a vanilla server
Fail
who's that?
nop
Bukkit yo
I still like vanilla servers, but I guess now I'm kind of used to at least essentials.
I'd like to make a vanilla survival server sometime though.
Our server Is anarchy atm
Doubt it'll happen
difference == ???
Like people spawn at will and do crazy stuff
No real rules for building
lol dari...
XD
wtfits
THE END
that was pretty messed up.
thanks for reading me a story, I guess.
XD
anybody still here?
ah, okay. I've seen servers use "anarchy" in a way that is really just basically "survival"
hmm. nope I guess.
well hai dari :D

0Dear Princess Celestia, I've learned that one of the joys of friendship is sharing your blessings. But when there's not enough blessings to go around, having more than your friends can make you feel pretty awful.

RainBroDash's favourite line from last night's fic: SilverMane Honestly, the shocking part for me wasn't that it was Dash, or that she had found me. It was that she was a SHE.

LOL DARI
Well at least RainBro got what I was saying.

0random question
02:3
0In 'The Ticket Master,' Twilight's Friendship report says that having more [something] than your friends can make you feel pretty awful. Having more what?
RainBroDash: Meh, if I still have my wallet in the morning, I'll have money to get hom.
Dari if I hear someone drunkenly blundering around maidenhead shouting TAEK ME BACK TO EQUESTRIA I NEED A DOCTOR PONY then I'm taking advantage of you.
Hopefully I still have my wallet in the morning.
home*

0rainbrodash 0_o
RainBro: I look forward to it. ;)
RainBroDash http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/original/CLOPCLOP.png

0don't you mean 4 guys?
12That topic has banned colors in it LOL
Hi GL :3
...No?
3 Including me.
Dari didn't know who he was or where he was. He vaguely recalled the idea of apples swimming in his brain. "I NEED A DOCTORPONY" he cried, unsure if anyone cared or heard him.
0...RainBroDash in a ninja outfit?
LOL
RainBroDash, however, did, and noticed Dari sprawled across the floor in a pool of some liquid he didn't care to investigate.
0uh oh
Welp, if I'm not back on Saturday RainBro found and took advantage of me.
You know where to find the body.
What meeting?
(No you don't)
that looks quite nice to me actually, i like cyan
Dari's eyes grew wide as RainBroDash approached, a sinister grin spreading across his face.
OH NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

0Hey Hipster_brony
8o hai ponies
I dunno, Twilight has problems lifting Ursa Minor, Celestia lifts the frickin sun.
ohai Hipster_Brony
...though arguably Ursa Minor consists of more than one star of greater mass than the sun...
ohai hipster
I stabed a Ursa Major.It died.
0pegacorn 0_o
I win.
That's not nice, he was just trying to protect his cub :(
It then revied itself.
0that's ok then
It then forgave me.
Hmm... being very bored I decided to do some experimenting with emulation.
They don't really explain if they're actually made of stars...
...though I guess technically everything is.
MFW was going to walk to station, told I can get a lift, then told by friend to get to station at 7:30, then told that they'd probably be later than that.
Lolemulation
MAKE YOUR MIND UP
>_>
so should I go buy all the mane 6 at the local toy store this weekend, or should i risk them running out?
Meh, probably 20 minutes or so.
.v.
I've discovered that: 1. The quad-processor PDP-11/74 is a massive pain. 2. The only thing that takes advantage of having four CPUs is RSX-11/M+, and only then all you get is RMS-11 not having to wait for CPU time. 3. having what amounts to five peripheral buses is a MASSIVE PITA.
eh, i'm still in the closed on my brony-ness
>random people I don't know run the store
>could not give less of a damn what they think
>get ponies
>win life
lolol I had to come out as a brony, my mom sews dresses for dolls and I needed some pointers
ACCEPT YOUR BRONY-NESS INTERIOR_GUMMY!
i accept it, but i have yet to tell people in irl
pointers have yet to be delivered >_>
Oh, and 4. MASSBUS disks are dual-ported, RMS loves disks; you can never access your disks when you want to because RMS is consuming all the disk time on Port B, while the monitor is going "I WANT DISK" on Port A.
TELL THEM NOW!
also laughs were had at my expense, but I don't give a shit
0so prince you have ponies?
0you bought ponies in UK?
I have a couple.
eBay
0from uk yet?
Oh, and of course dual-ported: Two CPUs out of four can see the disk. So if you're logged in on CPD, and the disks are attached to CPA and CPB, and you request the disk.. you have to wait for RMS on CPB to finish screwing around, and then wait for CPA to finish... whatever its doing to read the disk, cram the data into memory and let CPD do the work...
i was just reading the fim article on tv tropes, and evidently "losers" was censored in canad
*canada
why?
no idea
Meanwhile CPC is doing its own strange thing.
I'm from Canada,and nopony censors "losers"!
Dman: Nah, just Germany
Dari, the blind bag ones?
Eeyup
(inb4 dari has a blind bag rainbow dash)
0oh goo,d i was gonna harrass and spam the helle outta ya for the shop othawise
it was censored on the channel they broadcast it on
And what the hell IS TV Tropes anywayys?
I don't, prices of Dash and Fluttershy are ridiculous.
*anyways
/me just laughs at all the crazy computing and technical talk
@dari true that. it's like 20 quid with shipping
it's a site where people analyze TV tropes...
Eeyup
>shipping. That word will never sound the same again
Sounds impossible to use :P
Lawl
I love my new life
It's not actually.
I love... well... ponies.
F'ing shipping,how does it work?!
Plot hole is the worst word that's changed.
HAHA
shocking, I know
oh dear dari
Ohhh dear
FluttershyXManticore is canon
lolwut
0lol prince
The only issue is that multiprocessor support was kind of... not really implemented, as the 11/74 kind of died before going to market.
also. dari you not gone yet?
oh god, never again will I be able to watch a movie with my girlfriend... she constantly comments on plot holes
I wonder if leverage has leverage over plot holes and leverage.
8dari: i can get a brushable RD toy for $5
(Mostly becuase it outperformed the VAX... which every so mildly was a bad thing when they were trying to sell VAXen. :P )
8u marmalade?
0i mad
/me doesn't really share the same love for brushables
u jelly?
I like plastic hair more.
same
0very mad and jelly of u nonbrits who can get it now for like 5$
0;_;
I can get one for about $8-9
dario, where are you from originally? Cause you're in spain now, but you live in england right. You with relatives or something?
lol high taxes
I never found even ONE freakin' pony in ANY toy store where i live!
i was at barnes & noble yesterday and secretly searched for pony books
i did not find any
(and yes dman I'm talking to you)
Barnes & noble:i never saw it,but it was mentionned on AT4W.
That's decided then. I buy all the main ponies tomorrow and take a picture, just to be mean. :P
0RainBroDash - parents divorced
0so i LIVE in UK bot visit father in spain err ysumme
Oh ok. Also: were you born in UK or espana, and which is your natural language?:P
Just really curious, sorry about this inquisition xD

...Eugh Black Ops
Basically: anyone else hyped for MLG Anaheim, or am i gonna be a giant faggot on my own
Nah, only thing I will play you in is table tennis.
and ikr dari, but it's at MLG. So i had to mention it
follow a bit of sc2 not much
MLG?
/me is going to be a giant faggot on his own.
8black ops is for casuals http://files.sharenator.com/trollface_WRAPPEDinBACONs_FIRST_PIC_DUMP-s469x428-137060-580.jpg

0lol
I prefer MW2 (inb4 hate)
0mw2 actually has hit detection xp
bah doom is the only fps for me
I prefer Doom over a 28.8 modem connection
Dari: MLG is the 'Major League Gaming circuit' where they have gaming competitions bringing the world's best gaming teams together against each other, primarily in black ops, halo reach and starcraft 2
Meh.

Also: dari: Starcraft 2 is a great sport to watch, better than most conventional 'real sports' with balls and sweaty men etc. Aside from Tennis that shit is cash.
(inb4 SC2 isn't a sport, I'm not having this argument today)
Anyway, going now.
0rainbrodash they won halo3 and are gonna win reach i hope!
Be back tomorrow.

0it's lal upto mods
8whenever sprinkles gets here basically
0yea but sometimes other people able to stream start preshow for us ;D
0if sprinkles isn't here yet
8naw, sprinkles is the streamer today
8when he gets here he'll start up preshow
0sure thing brony
This website needs more sprinkles...
my Pinkie Pie has a tiny piece of glitter in one nostril. life irrevocably destroyed.
i've honestly never seen the toys
0haha
lol actually it'll be fine after I pour boiling water on her head
0you hairstyling? :3
Calculus is hard x.x
0only reason i want bwushables
pinkie will be fine, she can't feel pain
that's the plan, yup
0too much sugar in her blood :P
she's made from bubblegum, you can't explain that
8i would rather have a regular toy than a brushable tbh
aw, but hairstyling :3
the regular toys are the brushables, because hasbro seems to think that mlp is a show for little girls or something
8i mean regular as in non-brushable
kinda want both, but i'd rather make dresses for brushables.
0but you can't condishun and comb normal ones :3
0heck im getting some fo both
0but mainly i waht the bwushies and a blindbak RBD to be in my pocket at all times
0that's the basic plan
7D wake up :p
8i dont really want to brush them all that much though
8they would probably just get all tangled and shit
0b'ah ah'm taired, sugarcube
0hipster_brony now u know what most girls feel like xP
I really want a plastic rbd for my desk, or my 'me shrine'
0if too much hair, gotta keep it well
0lol rainbrodash
Want the fully molded ones on top of my TV in a neat row. :3
0i want one in my pocket so when i'm outta breath i reach in and grab RBD and go 'what would she do' and then sprint off again! Had this dream for a wile now :3
I don't want any of the toys. IMO toy made for cartoons always look bad
also: dman. >MFW I've been thinking for about an hour straight about how dishevelled my hair is today :3
They kinda failed on the Fluttershy though, it looks like :(
0lul had shower yet?
yeah, after my shower :<
my hair's getting long. I'm thinking about cutting it
0after shower?
0y u no shape it when wet?
i did!
But it went crazy
when it dried
I usually take a shower before bed... and I have the most awesome haircut in the morning
8im not sure a brushable is worth the trip to the pink aisle though
naturally curly hair?
I don't have curly hair really no
I'd call it straight hair
0rainbrodash u no doin it rite :P
but it goes crazy at the ends when it gets longer
0hipster_brony you so wrong silly :P
Oh it's worth it, especially if they don't even ask if you want it wrapped.
That alone should be worth $5 :P

8im saving my trip to the pink aisle for when they get a show-accurate RD plushie

0lol
Hipster_brony, god, if only >.>

but that was months and months ago
0my hair's longer :P
14K, I'm going with that then
I've not cut my hair since then (also: lost a stone and a half since then (H) )
or no, that was after I started losing weight
lol that's pretty much the length of my hair right now. Time for a haircut this month, though.
0losing weight? you don't look fat there...?
>implying I would link you a photo where I looked fat
but yeah I was still well over 12 stone in that picture
probably like 12 and a half
0oh i see
0you know what you need! daily runs :P
I hate running. It's so humiliating

I prefer cycling to running
0seems we have one who has fallen into the expectations of fail-i mean society
0failciety
lol I prefer to just take walks
running is overrated
0runs far more fun
0especially if freeruns :P
to be honest I needed to change my eating habits. No amount of exercise would change that.
0i want to do this with RBD toy in pockit
parkour? :P
If I can lose weight by eating right, I'm doing it right.
yeah, that's usually how it is
0rainbrodash
0it's like 20% eating 80% work
0unless you diet/starve
0inwhich case its 40/60
I used to eat like 2-3people's worth of food. Now I don't :P
Exercising in any way becomes much harder if you don't change what you eat, or at least that's how it's been with me.
Pats
:3
Dieting is a bad idea though.
Hey
0yea robotpinkie it is both u need :P
I'm on my iPod, I'm babysitting somebody
0it's easy to eat the right food if you're distracted with anything
0but exercise is hard work. i'm too lazy sometimes :P

lolol, it sounds really silly, but I feel like I've been helped a lot by ponies. :3
I wish there was a PO app
03there is, it's called stop using an iPod
in what way -in particular- robotpinkie? :3
I'm babysitting drf

No access to PC
get a mobile phone with an irc app, that's not an ipod/iphone
0Robotpinkie - i feel like i've been GREATLY hepled
Lol, I like Apple though
I guess mostly motivationally, I'd been kinda down and out for a while
brb
Tablet with 3G ftw
and then PONIES, and now I'm kinda doing shit with my life
Luckly, its an iPad2 >:D
Back
Or not luckly
Whatever
What Dusky said :P
Lucky
I mean the obvious thing is working as some kind of creative outlet
hello
it's hard to explain, it's just done so much more for me than it should have
0i'm going through some stuff in my life, as im sure most are, but Ponies helped / is helping me through it
/me sighs
0and, of course, you bronies
14I'm going to kill the wifi if it starts going twitchy again
14It seems to work AWAY from it
ohhai barry
14but not near it
and yeah, I really like the community aspect, too :3
You would've killed my wireless router by now
Mine seems to hate my PC
03right, I'm going now, but you iPad fans kindly go die in a fire kthx
(but iPad and iPod work fine with it :P)
I stumbled upon ponies a couple weeks into my most recent 'exceptionally happy' phase, so I don't think they're related, but my acceptance of ponies came about through my non-caring OH LOOK I'M FUCKING AWESOME attitude I've had for the last few months
0nice
Ok, whatever drf
Alice routers suck anyways pats, go eminent!
It happens, hehe. That's why I've started losing weight, and having more fun, and basically everything rocks
Haha, I like that reason
I needsa get one of those
What are you talking about rainbro? just got here.
Ohai polarfire
ohai :3
I'm talking about how awesome I am. And yes, in that arrogant sense :D
ohhai polarfire
Apple = stupid
All I can say
Not always
The iMac is the best operating system for graphical art programs
everyone was talking about ponies, and how it's helped them, or what it's done for them (if anything), and how good the fandom is :3
sharing the love basically
ohai Robot Pinkie
/me yawns and gives Dusky a dose of fire
oh I see.

The PC is the best operating system for graphical art programs and everything else
yeah :3

When I discovered ponies I was pretty happy too, but ponies made my life 20% cooler.
