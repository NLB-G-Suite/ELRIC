12you gotta give a little to get a little =o
I need it for an IRC server
12sort of speak
plus, I need a website
there you go, Angel, that's basically it in a nutshell
oh yeah, you want to see a site that I made in like 10 mins?
http://ytalk.co.cc:800/landing
well done you
sometimes
looks like it was made by a 14 year old :P
xD
I sought out the loners and made friends with them, and they're my best friends, and have been my best friends for more than ten years. Why else do you think I felt sorry for Haii?
13I don't have all that many friends irl, but the ones I do have I feel like I can trust them <3
^
Looks bad if you have the wrong resolution
13I'd rather have a few close friends than lots of crappy ones :P
I have 1920x1080
Same here :P
exactly
I agree with AE on that one.
7Manly: Well, if people are defiant, then...
I have: square
does the site have an external CSS file?
She reminded me of one of my friends from middle school.
NO!
idk
maybe
13Every friend that I have? They came to me first
^
how do you not know if you made it?
7Similarly, AE.
7Except I've analyzed the reason for my reasons.
Ohh
the css file is the file that contains the css
sorry, I read that wrong
I am very polite and I greet people a lot IRL
as in, the stylesheet
I wrote it in HTML
7Redundancy impressively not intended.

I was wondering when dari would show up :P
Also, Rainbow Dash. :)

yeah, Rainbow Dash is pretty awesome
I also like Pinkie Pie
LOL yeah
1) Spike
I just rewatched that one
and 3) Rainbow Dash
"But that rainbow one kicked me. :("
oh yeah, hahaha
dari: Exactly! That dragon's awesome
I must say, the series is getting pretty good
is it as awesome?

Can't decide tbh
depends on the episode

but overall probably Pinkie Pie :P

03and the disc has the wrong fricking volume label

I would like to have that
03I suppose I could try
03or you can wait for FMA to encode it
03he can put the 5.1 track from the DVD on it
I would rather now
*not
03I'm going to upload the ISO
FMA is a filter <censored>
03regardless
.
03I'm going to upload the ISO of both movies
03if you want to try to reauthor it, be my guest
he filters the crap out of everything
03I actually like FMA's encodes

he abuses filters and has some undesirable consequences

I compared them with my DVDs and noticed some detail loss
are you sure that's detail being lost, not noise?
yes
textures in buildings and rocks
because there's a grey area between detail & noise, and noise is ~detail
this is why I hate filtering
03I don't mind it if it works
03like deinterlacing, etc
fine details are thrashed
it depends
deinterlacing does not thrash fine details
03yes it can
actually, it can
03technically
03:P
if done incorrectly
even if you are using it correctly, if a deinterlacer deinterlaces a frame that wasn't interlaced in the first place, you get aliasing & blocking
I have seen this many times on my BD and TV encodes.
just a few frames here & there in an episode, but It is noticeable
man I hate the over censorship here
me neither. i don't tolerate encodes under 1fps.
anyway, you can be satisfied now now that that drf uploaden iso.
yea
I actually am thinking about doing my own version of it
SATISFACTION
<benny bernassi>
& encoding, by definition, kills details. it has to.
I am against that
hence why I sand untouched
*said
you mean add the 5.1 yourself?
should I decide to
and I hate de-edits
because they look botched and un-natural
because #pm

How much is a mobo?
a decent (by which I mean by ASUS or Gigabyte) AM2+ or AM3 socket, full-ATX motherboard is about £50
but hardware prices are higher in Europe than in the americas
Hmm
Does that include everything?
Cat: ^
it includes the motherboard
o.O
Cat: How much do you think I can selll a pentium d for??
very little
but I doubt you'll get much
like $20 ?

07it's run-on-y
/me cracks his knuckles "Here I cooome!"
07again
12Hey that one is only two lines long XD
07LOL
/me pokes Skyoko
07well I think it's because it's the 'as usual' part
07XD
I would poke the two 'we' startings.
10It's good
We [...], we [...].
12Mmm?
because repetition.
12hmm
12Lol it's fine to repeat things like "I" or "We"
07arti
07maybe add an 'and' before the second we
07o3o
07it connects the sentence
12Oh wait I see
12I thought you meant the two separate paragraphs starting with We
07no it's the last sentence
12Yes I've added an And in there now
07also arti
/me squish :>
12What did I say in it again? XD

I'd say focus on the sincerity of the letter, rather than the grammar. lol

07just about discussing things, uh
07peadge
07I don't REMEMBER
12To the list?
07Hm
all of us?
07I dont feel like I was involved enough
12It's optional
I doubt you'd want my name on there, as I'm not really a TST'er..
07but
07o3o
07I dont mind, add my name to the floofin' list.
12^^
You can add me to the list if you would like.
06Add me (If I'm not already there)
07hm, how bouts Lakorvu?
13Me of course~
07!espeon
10Add me </obviously> :P
12XD
Me too :P
07I likes 'korvu.
07o3o
07I also
add me too i suppose XD
07like apostrophes.
/me kicked
you know
the apostrophe should go on the other side of my name
but fine :p
07why should it?
07o3o
Because La Korv'?
10Most likely
07what I'm taking away is the 'la' part
12Ok is it safe to add her name without asking do you think? ovO
07I'm seeing this
07as a name
07not two separate esperanto words
07in the case of you
07o3o
07although
07were it words in esperanto, then yes
07you'd be right
10Hm

07that other network? Lolno, even if I'm not a furry, I don't want to be thought of that way haha
people are scaringly nearsighted.
07well, not that - but honestly
07it'd indirectly tell them something about you that you might want to regulate yourself
13Arti
I'm nearsighted and farsighted ;D
13I just spoke to Craiglol via MSN
13He's willing to add his name to the list
07even if I can explain my stance, they'd still be free to draw conclusions regarding you

03anyway
ditch it
go with WIFI

03I'm going to wire up a long Ethernet cable
03I just have to drill a hole in the floor

03nickstr, the wifi has a WORSE signal
03than PoE
03er
03not PoE
EoP?
03xD
03something like that yeah
PoS is more like it
lol
03LOL
03...?
03how would you do that
just send out a signal on 28 MHz
CONNECTION TERMINATED
(he has tons of radio equipment)
!say la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la Katamari Damancy~
la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la Katamari Damancy~
03wait
03but anyway
:P
03Ethernet powerline uses 28kHz?
no
it uses 3 to 30 MHz
03not quite sure how that works
11<14nickstr11> just send out a signal on 28 >M<Hz
that is an example
03it sends radio signals through the wires? o_O
yes
03er MHz not Khz my bad
which leak out like crazy
ever heard of carrier current AM?
03nope
it actually takes advantage of that characteristic
no RF shielding for electrical wiring
its about the same concept
except carrier current AM deliberately uses this where as for ethernet over powerline this is a side effect
carrier current AM was most commonly used at colleges and universities which have broadcasting courses because it used to be required for those on over the air AM or FM stations to have a special FCC license even if they did not do any engineering
no
03Misty is in about half of them :P
link them again

03ugh
03but wires are wires no?
interference with itself./-+induction mb?
ormb one of the wires inside the cable is shorted/broke?
use a cont tester/multimeter
03not sure
03o.o
03well
they're cheap, like $10-20
very useful.
03I'm thinking it could just be the router
03being dumb

03and ooh
03Travel Channel is doing an Extreme marathon on the 28th
fma & nick can attest the usefulness of a multimeter.
03and I now get Travel HD

WLIO TV in Lima Ohio aired it on October 31st 2010
I just used one today during the power supply tests

Are bleh

Then the plots and characters
12I only watch official dubs
6that's stereotyping an entire universe of media
06I don't even have an opinion on anime because
06it doesn't interest me enough for me to even watch it~
6I'm not much for anime
6but some series I find amazing
6for the most part though
6it's a bleh
Which is why I don't watch it every night and day @ Espeon ;3
12I am very picky with most shows however, both anime and non-anime
/me dies
12~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
12~ is spectacular
12Espeons particularly like it for some reason
06It adds that

6lets just go ahead with patchouli's nondirectional laser lol
that marisa jacked?
13THOSE LASERS
13forcing me in one direction
13;;
6lol ikr
6one direction, while bullets EVERYWHERE-
6she may be my favorite character, but I am terrified of her phantasm fight
but yeah
13partly for the awesome music
Yukari's stage isn't really that hard
6ok my problem with PCG
6*PCB
6I can't even get past youmu LOL
6she destroys me
6for reasons I don't know
~
6she destroys me in CtC as well
13is it weird that my biggest motivation for unlocking extra modes is for the music that the EX boss has? |D
6lol
k the easiest extra boss is swako
suwako
nuff said
13I have to agree, even though I haven't beaten her yet
6I've only played against flandre and mokou
mokou just.. ugh
13hasn't taken me nearly as long to get through her spellcards as it did for me when I fought Mokou
6...dude, I can't get past MoF
6I dunno why
13took me many months of on/off playing to beat Mokou
MoF is actually pretty hard
13and I've never been able to beat her again since then |D
6but a lot of people think MoF is the easiest
lolwat
Kanako isn't kidding
13I find MoF pretty easy overall
13it's just Kanako and Sanae that I hate fighting xD
6dude
6kanako
Sanae is a good girl
6SO MUCH PAIN
|3
i know this lol
That's a running meme
also
6I never even got to her last one ;-;
12Hi
6siki?
sikieiki
12!espeon

13Awesome, I know a pro Touhou player! :D
6http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2009/355/9/1/touhou___mindfck___demotivator_by_zk306.jpg
6about sums it up
OHYA
said zun
6at least, along the same lines of IN
/rage
6I actually had a fairly tough time on the third stage
third stage is always hard :/
normally harder than the fourth
6no, 5TH stage is hard
unless it's LOLREIMUMARISA in IN
6I swear....ever 5th stage EVER
ugh
6...
6ok well that's just horrible lol
13Marisa is easier than Reimu
6I still can't decide which of those two is easier
6I'd say marisa
6but
6stars
Reimu is LOL
6MESS YOU UP
13either that or I'm just more used to playing against Marisa xD
Angry birds > Touhou :3
/me mauled
At all.
13LOL THAT
13I still haven't captured that
13I've come close a few times though
i've actually managed to capture yukari's extra card
13The fact that the entire screen shakes when the laser appears screws me over
13damn 4th wall breaking :<
also
That was fun
13o-o
6I still need to beat SA on normal
ahaha
6I beat it on easy within like 3 tries
13I find SA to be the most difficult LOL
Utsuho is hax
6UTSUHO IS THE DEFINITION OF HAX
13Okuu~~
6all for one reason
13Black Hole spellcard is pretty fun xD
Orin is harder than okuu tho :/
13^
Easily
6Hell and Heaven Meltdown
AE! If you have requests for my show, Now might be a good time to tell me them
XD
Okuu is just insult to injury as a stage six boss LOL
6^pretty much that
13I want to unlock Extra mode, because SA's extra mode has the best music IMO
13|D
And WTF Koishi's extra
Hearts coming out of her skirt.
6I don't like koishi's theme
6much
SA has best extra stage them
theme
6don't like her stage much either LOL
CLOSELY contested with GFW extra
6fairy wars
I still haven't reached Fairy Wars extra LOL
6same
6I can get to the second boss
6and die
13I've been meaning to play that
13|D
I can 1cc it
6angel, prepared to rage
If I sit for like five hours
6endlessly
That's how I 1cc'd UFO
12http://cheezcomixed.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/koma-comic-strip-but-ta-toes-are-sentient-now.jpg XD
6I don't like uFO
Shou's curvy lasers made me RAGE
6I can't get myself to play it
13EW CURVY LASERS
13UFO has the worst characters overall, but that's my opinion xD
ehh
13The only character I like is Nue
the only respectable characters are the stage 3 boss, stage 4 boss, and the extra
lol
back
(japanese name)
13I haven't actually played any of the official games for a while now
13I've been hooked on CtC |D
sanae is a good girl ~.~
6I'm still working on playing CtC and actually BEATING IT
13Sanae's one of my favourites xD
yukari's theme is actually night fall
not necrofantasia
imo
necrofantasia is just a remix of rans theme
6but yeah, evening star is definitly hers
lol
Even though evening star in 10.5 is all LOL I'M FRENCH.
13also the combination of Chen and Ran's theme on stage 4 is <3

02In order:
02HR only 9, I want to play the story first.
02Weapon of choice: Switch Axe
02Armor: R. Ludroth complete set (I'm to lazy to get another one)
02I'm HR nine
02...ty one
02Now, The lagiacrus >D
04lol
02(Inb4: Death)
04If you're going for Rathian I suggest the Qurupeco armour.
04Fire Resistance.
04And the Barroth armour for Lagiacrus because it's the only one I can remember that has thunder resistance.
04Of course I've never been good at suggesting armours.
02If you're going to fight Rathian, totally go in Leather Armor
04I never use skills right 8D
04lol
02You'll be amazed how much more skills you get out of it that way
04Really?

02LOL
04XD
02I remember when I fought my first Rathian
02The Rathian was a pain with this armor
02I was still in leather armor
04XD
04I used Barroth armour for it.
04I used Barroth armour for nearly everything. After the amount of time I spent farming for the materials, I wasn't going to let that time go to waste/
02But at this time I was fighting a Qurepeco and it called Rathian D:
04Hahahaha
02I posted a bit in there
02Hey
02now... any protips for fighting the lagiacrus?
12:D
06Pandas :3
04He takes the most damage from cutting attacks to his chest.
02Yes
02So much cuddlefluff
06<3
02The way it should be <3
02Like me
02HAMMER
04I'm a LS/GS/SnS user.
02The DUAL HAMMERS
04XD
02XD
06Oh yes
04Throwing hammers.
02Hmm, should I cut its tail before anything?
04Or Greathammer.
12^v^
04Ray, focus on his tail when on land. It's easier to cut it off while it's on land.
04Wait
02Gunhammers too
04is this the Repel mission or the Hunt mission?
02Just like there are gunlances
02GUNHAMMERSPLZ
04rawr
hi
02Hunt
04Ok, then follow our advice.
12meep?
02Here's my advice for hunting Lagiacrus: Hit Lagiacrus
02With that, you shall do well
04lol
02traps?
02'k
04Espy, most do.
How's it going for you?
04Online though, they take like, 5-10 minutes 'cause you all gang up on it.
I'm doing alright
02Just depends on if you have a good enough weapon, and how good you are at hitting the monster to do enough damage
04Bah weep granna no bongo?
04Try hitting it's head.
04You deal ALOT more damage.
04Hell
02SHOOT IT IN THE HEAD
02SHOOT IT IN THE HEAD
04Rathian only takes me ten-fifteen minutes
12wtf? O_o
04lol
04It took him like, 30 seconds.
02Yeah lol
02.___.
02Link or die
04I don't have it unfortunately.
04But it was amazing.
02http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sybTW6T0510
02He used something called "Headlocking"
04And it was AMAZING
02Easy to do with overpowered weapons

it actually is possible to record audio on a piece of wire

12hmm
good for you.
mp3 is not that good a compression format
especially for recompression
I am not surprised about that point jun
(demographics prolly)
classical music listeners tend to be very consious about sound quality
&also, classical music is usually quieter, and hence compresses to a smaller size than pop music, for lossless codecs
yes
yep, concertFM here is frickquiet compared to the pop stations next to it.
that is the norm
jazz stations are about the same way
dynamics are quite important in that genere too
i don't think i have a dedicated jazz station here, but concertFM sometimes plays jazz
there is one near me
KPLU 88.5 which is NPR
they play LOTS of jazz
plus I heard a jazz station on AM as well
KBSU 730 Boise Idaho
narrowbanded, muddy and distorted audio, and insensitive
and they sounded incredible at the time
the AMAX tuners have a treble response up to 15,000 Hz normally with some making it up to 20,000 Hz
excelent engineering on the AM section but I have to deal with some bad adjustment slugs which cause it to work only intermittently

nicknamed Caserin and Luverin
they are not the greatest but can hold their own
12hmm
those two are at the Cerulean City gym
12?

the episode is Luvdisc Is A Many Splendored Thing
12never saw it

I have seen it several times
12o-o
even have it on DVD
12yay :3
12that's about it
12i'm awake
12deal with it :<
np
no
12how goes
12lol
12nowadays yes
plus the quality is bad compared to the DVDs
fuzzy and low resolution
12ahh
the DVDs are much sharper and clearer
i just got done delivering papers
12ok
not to mention they are far more compact
12nod
technically VHS is infinite resolution; it's bounded by the fact it's analogue and can't practically go past a certain focus level
same goes for the region 4 PAL sets of Johto Journeys and Johto League Champions
no
in a theoretical sense
the bandwidth available on a VHS tape is HIGHLY limited
only by practicality
plus S-VHS did not catch on in the home
and D-VHS was a flop
I still hate dealing with VHS tapes due to the poor picture quality
along with dropouts and head noise
yeah of course
i just don't watch videos
the dropouts you can reduce by cleaning the heads which I try to but you can't get rid of all of them
:33c
head noise you can't deal with except on a computer after digitizing the tape
plus they wear out over time
also VHS-- yeah
the picture quality deteriorates with every playback
DVDs still look the same as they did when they were first pressed no matter how many times they are viewed
3.141592653589793238dove
/me hides
12!exakr
same can be said for laserdiscs
unless you have a bad player that scratches it or something
even though like VHS tapes they are analog
yea
but I never had that experiencce

just asking
12no I dont
12only ftp
Ive been trying to figure it out buit can't
He might have removed it, not sure
you could try /addline it, if you have the flag
12Lol I've never used it and don't know if I want to risk it xD
I asked other people but they said that they don't know
do you guys know?
Well, the problem with addline is that once you add the line to the config, you can't delete it without accessing it
You can't fix it without going into the file and editing it again
Have fun ;p

02Or if you're awesome and have Cap Guru like me
02I know
02<3

02Hey

awww
13Fire/flying type :3
sawie :3
I guess I'm the only one interested xD
/me smells floof
Not in it directly, but in the sociology of it
Sure it's not in the making fun of people of it?
I mean, I don't believe in it either
12Charizard LOL
/me runs
7I was thinking Ho-oh. :P
Me either
*don't believe in it
whoops :P
I'm fascinated with the sociological aspects of it
/me rolls on the floor
7You can see my sketches. :P
02<3
Yeah, that part is actually very sad
02Mmk
A lot of people are going to lose everything they have because of this nonsense -- everything that people have built up for themselves all their lives
7http://imageshack.us/m/202/3237/dendrootchikiwiandhumiw.png <-- Bottom-ish area.
Taking advantage of people isn't sad?
(assuming you weren't joking, of course)
I haven't seen too many people actually doing that... I've seen a few joke websites
03however, that's not saying much.
/me hides
But I'm talking about how you said you were interested in it
It's not a viable business model anyway
7Ah, shush, DRF.
03no u
02Ahah, that's cute
02Y'know drf
speaking of rapture
# Numerous people on five continents submitted information to live maps indicating that the deadline had passed without any of Camping's predicted phenomena being observed.[52]
# Two minor earthquakes hit the Pacific.[54]
# Several news organizations reported that the Rapture had not occurred and the prediction appeared to have failed.[56][57]
# Nothing appears to have happened in the UK
02Quan, are you getting paid that much?
No one is seriously interested in this because of that
It's like
7Lol, no. :P
7I did sprite a quarter of a person's fakedex for ~$50.
Meh
I just saw you said this
[14:32:30] <+Aristeo> I didn't care about it until I heard about all the business opportunitis
yeah xD
02Ah yeah that one person
Of course not
7Hmm, nah; more like a third of the fakedex.
I could tell you were having fun with it back then
xD
I imagine a huge influx of "Toldja sos" today
02Those were pretty cool too
that's really all I hear when people talk about the rapture
It's a meme now?
Since when?
Maybe not meme
But no, not really
But this phenomenom
Yep
You're the only one listening
And you already talk about it
I'd say she's simply complaining about everyone taking it seriously is all

02Seriously, good luck to you Quan, I'm really excited to see it
that's it
it's very amusing
That's a counter culture role
You're participating <3
Sure
Sociology aside
But it's still only to one person
meaning my ranting is probably not spreading it any more
we responded as such
and that's it
I did and I disagreed
Called it
But neither of us are
<3
dude, no
I'm not "pretending to be above" anything
she's simply stating her opinion
as was I
Am I not allowed to rant about things that annoy me without being on a "high horse"?
I guess I'm counter-ranting
Ugh
forget it
I'm on a counter-counter-culture thing
is it safe.....?

l3
hi
mostly because i haven't been able to be active in any forum besides the GG2 forum for the past 4 years
and i don't like having to write text walls then wait for replies etc.
i mostly RP in IRC
5One-on-ones tend to move most quickly because you don't have to wait for more than one person to reply. x3
I haven't IRC RPed properly for ages
i don't think i've ever done it "properly"
but i could probably
if i wanted to set up an IRC RP server one of the things i would do would be raise the character limit because i'm fairly sure you can do that
if i remember correctly
;o
5...Which is really irritating. xD
pretty much
400-600 words are text walls to me
Causes problems with scripts as well sometimes
especially since the only forum i've been on often is basically IRC anyway
in messageboard form
but it's not an RP board anyway
it doesn't have one either
and that actually describes the only other forum to hold my attention quite well
lmao
Now it's only 2 main forums and one other that's kinda deadish
02I used to lurk 9001 forums
5It's a little weird for me, though. I mean most of the community is male and around my dad's age. Women are such a relative rarity we have our own sub-forum. xDD
IRc is basically the only thing that really keeps my attention

I had a good day but I'm stressing out a little bit now
Why's that?
02Thx~
and I googled it and found the place
=/
email them?
that's odd
but there's absolutely no data of how much the show costs to get into or when the doors open
O_o
and I don't even know if I'll get a response from them because by the looks of it they hardly ever even update their websites
That's weird, you'd think that'd be bad for business
Yeah.
and it sucks because it's a really good lineup
yeah well there's lots of venues downtown that are like that that I've never heard of
someone randomly making out in a PM here

then one of the two shows I was going to go to at the end of the month cancelled; but maybe that's a good thing because I don't wanna overload
;-; i missed it
it was in PM
Damn you sound busy.
it's like all these events end up coming around the same time as eachother

could it be like

I tried
but I just can't
yes
12so is mac in a way
same with Mac OS to an extent

Kittenkittenkittenkittenkitten
EW IE haters
inb3: they all suck
inb2 opera
:P
EW opera
That's only good on consoles and handhelds :P
"good"
Seems more fitting to be on a non-PC :P
sooo
everyone here is saying all browsers suck
Thank you individuality!
Without them, we would all be zombies that agree with each other :P
13speaking of zombies
do my eyes decieve me?
yes they do
/me idles to watch episode 7
oh, okay
I guess I'm going crazy then
yep
Lol.
RDX actually ONLINE? Wow.
I'm always online
just not on here
at least when I'm not working
:(
Oh heck know I hate all of you
"no"
Haha. XD
now, if this is my imagination, why is everyone else talking to him?
I think someone's been lied to
oh, or that
and based upon my methods of speaking that's a good thing
or we're all having the same hallucination
hmmm
I like Stormy's theory
that's gotta be it
makes for a good episode of the Twilight Zone
nah I'm real
well, no harm in going along with this mutual hallucination if that's the case
oh, okay
last I checked
well
12IE kinda sucks though XD
in that case don't use too much brain power
you might overheat
good point
it's happened before
can't go on SF anymore because of all the My little pony fettishes :P
...Oh dear.
well, you see
about that
12in other browsers, a-png files look like static images
on the forum, at least...
lol
that and the anti americanism
12It should be animated, but on other browsers it’s not
;P
It's kinda a waste of time
Not to mention even bigger than Gifs :o
/me shot
cept Dari
I'm ok with him
compared to other forums I've been on SF is the most patriotic place ever
:P
Haha
then you are in some rotten places
yeah
./server read mail 1
which is why I don't go there anymore
no, she's just not in the military
outside the military you see it just about anywhere :P
Has nothing to do with me being in the military either
12Lol, that’s because a-png’s are animated png file, whitch are much higher quality then gif
12files*
Aaand?
HTML 5 and SVGs have even higher quality and support
:P
even though the world ended yesterday
nuh uh
(Not to mention Javascript and all the other animators for images/files) :P
I still think you's be a hallucination
yes huh
that hurts my feelings
I can't fly
hmm
hallucinations could fly
I didn't think hallucinations had feelings
maybe I was wrong after all...
they can still flye
"fly"
12Well, a-png's are much easier to make without corrupting
fyre flye?
evil doer
glad to see Spyrochat is active as usual
Haha.
12FireFox a-png editor
12Gimp can too
spyrochat LIVES?!
this is news to me
not really
jk
me and two others lol
Dari and me
Dari and I
for you grammar nazis
thought maybe Infamouz, haven't seen him in a while
Nu uh
or she use to be
:P
*?
I should bring back my GrammarPolice script
that or my sister
It would never have to kick anyone here though
:P
12I would not get a web browser for that alone though
Fail.
LOL
it is to me
oops
12Like you said, no one uses a-png files
not a very wise person to pick
well, when you leave it up to fate...
wisdom's got nothin' to do with it
12I just like to make them from time to time for myself XD
or gline
those are fun
I'm familiar
Yeah, that would be pretty unwise
but here's another fun one
random gline script
that was five characters from my keyboard right there
Exactly ;p
*6
vowels?
:P
you doing Hooked on Phonics or something?
I actually went out and bought a 3DS
wha-seriosuly?
I would if there were more games
besides working
or lower price tag
or, you know, both
well I do need it for when KH: 3D comes out
:D
cars are overrated
you can have one of mine
12But watch out for IE8 (no web pages with round corners D: )
and the two things I mentioned, right?
You have more than one?
I have two
why?
I bet it's his baby.
nah
lol the coke truck
do it!
I can't give her the truck
it's locked in the garage
and take a whole bunch of glass bottles of coke with it
the truck is for special occassions
How would I get it anyway
I'd drive it to you of course
But then how would you get home? XD
...a dn how would you get back?
fly?
YOU ARE A HALLUCINATION
I could
except for the winter
I live in NH lol
Does that have OMGOMGSPARKLYCORNERS ;o
it's not much different then Minn :P
except you're closer to the ocean and such
I never go there
boo
(Again, round cornered pages have as much appeal to me as Twilight's vampires ;D)
fine I'll send the truck to Dari
I'm sure he could find good use for it
how would you get over the ocean?
Hahaha.
and back?
it's a coke truck
it can do anything
it flies
nah
it's a submarine
ooh
I was just gonna say that
even cooler
gotta snorkler and everything
I'd spray paint "PEPSI ROOLZ COKE SUGZ" on the side. (:
lol
Just in case the fish want some Coke
he woudl to
I've been to Mars a time or two
just visiting some old war buddies
Lol, I put feet on Spyro and it looks as though he has little shoes.
image?
pics or didn't happen
Sure, give a me second.
you all suck
you suck too, man, thanks
XD
(I remembered this time)
The APNG format was rejected by the official PNG steering committee and as thus has no change to be approved as a supported W3 standard - http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_name=3.0.6.32.20070420132821.012dd8e8%40mail.comcast.ne
Random, but if the PNG guys don't like it
http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z204/prince-dari/spyrofeet.jpg
Then it's a trashy format :o
Tiny shoes.
haha, nice
now just give him gloves
/list
BRB
/me drives on through this channel
how's that?
:P
yeah it does, but the larger IRC networks take up all the users
You need to buy several e-cars and drive them all over the place.
Could just find sites that don't have an IRC channel and send them an email about whether they'd like to set one up or not.
I've tried that in the past
hard to find such website, but I'm sure you have more connections :P
/me shoots out Lambda's tires
Aww, crap
/me calls up his repairman
/me gives up and calls the Michelin Man
/me throws out tacks
12Random floof
