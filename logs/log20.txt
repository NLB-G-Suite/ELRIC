plus, I need a proxy, for school
I need a seedbox
12you gotta give a little to get a little =o
I need it for an IRC server
13They'd hang around me until they found someone better, then never talk to me again
12sort of speak
plus, I need a website
there you go, Angel, that's basically it in a nutshell
oh yeah, you want to see a site that I made in like 10 mins?
http://ytalk.co.cc:800/landing
Cat: ^^
but ah well...that's life for ya
well done you
life sucks
sometimes
looks like it was made by a 14 year old :P
xD
life can suck and be awesome, depending on how you live it :>
13I don't have all that many friends irl, but the ones I do have I feel like I can trust them <3
^
Looks bad if you have the wrong resolution
13I'd rather have a few close friends than lots of crappy ones :P
12Most people come and go, but the ones that stay are the ones you know are worth it just give them a chance =)
I have 1920x1080
Same here :P
exactly
I agree with AE on that one.
7Manly: Well, if people are defiant, then...
I have: square
does the site have an external CSS file?
She reminded me of one of my friends from middle school.
13I've been telling myself to try to be more open to new people, but I haven't succeeded so far |D
NO!
idk
maybe
13Every friend that I have? They came to me first
^
how do you not know if you made it?
He'd always get picked on, and he had no friends, and the teachers would always bag on him for interrupting the class.
what is that?
13I've never taken the initiative before :B
AE,try harder ^^ you'll succeed soon enough
7Similarly, AE.
7Except I've analyzed the reason for my reasons.
Ohh
the css file is the file that contains the css
sorry, I read that wrong
I am very polite and I greet people a lot IRL
as in, the stylesheet
I wrote it in HTML
7Redundancy impressively not intended.
/j #lllll
@log
but I don't think I'd ever just go up to a person and be like "wanna be friends"
@log atkls stklrt sdl g g
SUP
Kosoveon: yeah, that'll be freaking the person out.
I guess the page doesn't really have any style
yep XD
some people do that to me
7If I find something both I and the other person can connect to, I start with that (since I'm well-versed there) and expand.
13I try to be nice to everyone just to show that I'm a nice person to hang around with, and as a way of implying that I need time to open up to them properly
meh
13most people don't follow through with it though |D
/help isnum
I don't mean that in an insulting way
I know
same
I mean it doesn't have organisation into tables or div containers
I made it in like 10 mins
Cat: Can you help me ?
Like, I am a failiure
:(
I am SAD!
7'tis a gap in who would talk to whom in the social hierarchy.
13If I knew how to take initiative, I would. But how the heck do you approach someone without it looking weird? o-o
this was the last page I made http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9897526/Web%20Design/index.html
hmm, parts of it seem to have changed or broken :/
I never do. I just talk with them about whatever and just let things go from there
12I wouldn't put too much thought into it
oh well
13Wouldn't you need some kind of opportunity before you can start talking to them? Because opportunities can be hard to get sometimes ^^;
if I have something in common with the person, then a friendship might come from it
Dost thou speak, knave?
Whats your name?
7Accept awkwardness, AE. :P Austin does.
it says on the footer of that site
A_E: try to find an opportunity.
Oh
RICHARD!
xD
sometimes you might need to take the first initiative
yes, thanks >.>
I was gonna say, can I call you dick
just like in a relationship
but that would be mean
no fucking way
xD
my grandad is called dick
dont want to make things confusing
lol
13I know a few people who I share interests with, but still, I don't know how to keep a conversation going with someone I've never really spoken to before xD
7Brb.
yup
sorry
but that site I made is pretty basic I guess
on ze phone
AE: you can ask about anything. :D

13Lol Kosoveon, I have to agree with that xD
what do you mean?
@log
God, you guys have this down to a science. xD
I don't have to be with a friend 24/7 and talk ALL THE TIME
13I have so much time to myself I can do whatever I want without being constantly asked to meet up somewhere or something xD
Then who was phone?!
I have time to actually relax XD;
13'Cause I'm too lazy to leave the house most of the time |D
You wanna make one for me?
it conforms to HTML 4.01 Strict and uses almost entirely relative sizes
XD lol
same :P
which is good
I am desperare
oh, and it also conforms to the WCAG high contrast guidelines!
so colour blind users can read it fine
:)
02^ agreed with everything said before
lol
02now back to homework
13LOL
RAAAAAAY
13Get back to work, fool >:/
I've had this guy come up to me and be like "Hey, wanna be friends"
I was like "sure"
terrible mistake
Ehhh, that's not how it works. lol
/me glomps a Ray
because from then on...he would NOT STOP CALLING ME
/me ish glomped
because we had a common interest in megaman or whatever
but he wanted to have more than casual chat
12Yeah, it's a little more time consuming than just making a snap decision
he wanted deep, intellectual convos with me XD
Kosoveon: o.o
@log

that sucks...
@log

13When my house phone rings, I NEVER answer the phone unless it's my parents, my grandad or one of my close friends
phone was you
02Funfact: I didn't meet my best friends by videogames, I meet them by the power of Anime :D
13anyone else, I'll let it ring |D
02They also play'd videogames, so jackpot :D!
Ray: me too :D
thank god my actual friend don't call me all the time XDDDD
*friends
/help isnum
my friends rarely call, they prefer to text instead
13I'm a texter, not a talker :P
same here :)
sometimes with certain friends I find it hard to talk through the phone
@log
I met mine after he hit me with a basketball to my face on accident. That's how true friends are made. <3
not a fan of texting
13Because I'm bad at keeping conversations alive, and I'm a listener rather than a speaker on the phone anyway xD
@log 20
/me high fives a A_E
@log 200
13:D
13Lol I have a friend who could practically have a conversation with herself if she wanted to xD
that's because I get so anal about my writing, I want to text entire, cohesive paragraphs XD
I stutter a bit when I talk through the phone >.<
13I've had 45 minute conversations with her on the phone, and most of it will be her talking and me replying every now and then |D
02^
02Same here |D
12phones annoy me
13It's awkward when the person on the other end expects me to talk more though, because then I'll just be sat there in silence because I dunno what to say |D
/me high fives a A_E again
/me high-fives back xD
:D
I always reply back with a hmm okay.
that's me a lot on the phone XD
I find I have nothing to add so I'll just be silent for 90% of the call
12LOL awesome!
because honestly...I am not the biggest fan of long convos unless I'm having them with a close friend or something ^^;
Ray: LOL. put it on a stand or something

hi
Any luck finding it?
nope
:(
they said the same thing you did
To the internet!
nearest one is in Saint Cloud
ah
XD
She's married to him
is she trying to get him to watch it with her?
this should be obvious
seriously
XD
XD
my mom and Casey were watching it out in the other room
man, they must be deaf or something too
the TV was so loud
you should check your phone
I saw the picture
haha
ah
didn't answer because I got it while I was driving
and wtf is wrong with my computer...
hm?
everything's freezing and lagging
it's getting annoying
D:
that happened to mine last night when watching ponies
It's the pony disease
D:
I had to kill the Chrome process and pick up where I left off again
oh no!
now that you mention it
Princess Trollestia is infecting all our computers!
ponies seem to be the common factor in our computers freezing up
oh yeah, I see what you guys mean by calling her Trollestia
:P
after all that stress of who to give the ticket to
haha
"Well, why didn't you say so?! Here's six tickets"
"well duh, you knew I had 5 friends"
I like how in the end you realize that Spike actually secretly does want to go
Spike is awesome
XD
yeah he is
he's my favorite so far
So... favorite character?
I just realized
Well, I couldn't sleep.
my favorite characters are all the dragons
I was wondering when dari would show up :P
Also, Rainbow Dash. :)
except the gay river dragon
XD
yeah, Rainbow Dash is pretty awesome
I also like Pinkie Pie
But Flutterguy was just awesome.
LOL yeah
but my top three favorite characters so far are:
1) Spike
I just rewatched that one
2) mean "evil" dragon
and 3) Rainbow Dash
the gay river dragon reminds me of burgh
"But that rainbow one kicked me. :("
the bug leader in Black/White
oh yeah, hahaha
dari: Exactly! That dragon's awesome
I must say, the series is getting pretty good
There's another 'evil' dragon much later on in the Owlicious episode.
is it as awesome?
Ehs a pretty cool dragon, eh hoardes treasure and doesn't afraid of anything.
ah I see
hi
Hey.
sup
who's your favorite character on MLP?
fluttershy
Can't decide tbh
depends on the episode
between?
ah
Like some characters will just annoy me in certain episodes
but overall probably Pinkie Pie :P
Massive angry Derpy.
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130566415127.png
I like Pinkie Pie too
woah
huge Derpy
also that's awesome dari
I watched Winter Wrapup today and they mentioned Derpy
"Ditzy Doo flew North instead of South"
...
Hahaha
I HOPE THEY DON'T ACTUALLY CALL HER DITZY DOO.
THAT'S TERRIBLE.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A DOG'S NAME.
Lauren Faust said that was her name
Not technically.
...
I think I remember seeing that somewhere
EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW
They never showed which pony Ditzy Doo was.
EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW
EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW
EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW
EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW
"but she can be Derpy if everyone likes"
Someone said that one episode in series two Trollestia is going to leave Luna in charge and hang around with the main 6 ponies.
HAHAHAHAHA
Someone also said Derpy is going to be a more important character in season 2
but I kind of doubt that
She's supposed to get an episode.
And so is Luna.
who's Luna?
Nightmare Moon
Celestia's sister
ah
Oh yeah, my favourite character is Angel bunny - he's so awesome.
FUCK YO CARROT
Angel Bunny is Fluttershy's puppet master based on the eoisode's I've seen
*episodes
is it just me or does the mayor sound like spike
You guys heard of the desktop pony program?
nope
You can have ponies running around your desktop (DERPY!).
A Very Derpy Desktop
XD
Someone should put all the MLP episodes in one long video. Marathon! XD
omg yes

:p
i didnt come back
neither did you.
03LOL what
actually now that I think about it if I can get an untouched unfiltered version of Pokemon Heroes in HD from the Blu Ray disc I will do the bundle I would have done
Pokemon 4Ever and Pokemon Heroes
that would have made far more sense and Mirimax owns the rights to both as well
03yeah yeah we know
03anyway I got the disfc
03-f
03they're both on one single layer disc
03and the disc has the wrong fricking volume label
03and it's 2.0 stereo only
03but, the video is actually 1080p.
nice
could you rip just Pokemon Heros from it?
I would like to have that
03I suppose I could try
03or you can wait for FMA to encode it
03he can put the 5.1 track from the DVD on it
I would rather now
*not
03I'm going to upload the ISO
FMA is a filter <censored>
03regardless
.
03I'm going to upload the ISO of both movies
A filter what?
03if you want to try to reauthor it, be my guest
he filters the crap out of everything
03I actually like FMA's encodes
K
not me
he abuses filters and has some undesirable consequences
o_o
Late? XD
03LOL WOW
03Yeah, my router is HORRIBLE right now
K
03I'm going to take that piece of s*** back to Micro Center tomorrow
the Master Quest ones looked ok but blurred
12o-o
12!epic
I compared them with my DVDs and noticed some detail loss
are you sure that's detail being lost, not noise?
yes
textures in buildings and rocks
because there's a grey area between detail & noise, and noise is ~detail
this is why I hate filtering
03I don't mind it if it works
03like deinterlacing, etc
fine details are thrashed
it depends
deinterlacing does not thrash fine details
so I am fine with it
03yes it can
actually, it can
03technically
03:P
if done incorrectly
even if you are using it correctly, if a deinterlacer deinterlaces a frame that wasn't interlaced in the first place, you get aliasing & blocking
I have seen this many times on my BD and TV encodes.
but it does not blur the spit out of everything
just a few frames here & there in an episode, but It is noticeable
man I hate the over censorship here
also, if you don't filter, you risk losing details that would be lost due to noise & low-bitrate. if you overfilter, similar. It so happens that most people don't reach the sweet spot, and hence your opinion.
plus if I encode stuff I don't have the time nor a 16 core CPU
me neither. i don't tolerate encodes under 1fps.
anyway, you can be satisfied now now that that drf uploaden iso.
yea
I actually am thinking about doing my own version of it
SATISFACTION
<benny bernassi>
if the Pokemon 4Ever thing is true HD and I can get an untouched direct rip
but i thought you were against restores n stuff
& encoding, by definition, kills details. it has to.
I am against that
hence why I sand untouched
*said
you mean add the 5.1 yourself?
should I decide to
&btw, i'm not happy with M5 unless i get the one from KIDS and redo my de-edits into a TA.
and I hate de-edits
because they look botched and un-natural
because #pm
& 'jame's boobs'
last one I saw I threw out
once bitten, twice shy.
I will only tolerate them if I can get versions without the de-edits and if they are done in a way which is seamless
including language trackes
was mine seamless?
*tracks

can't say

07Hai.
Been a while.
07Indeedu, it has.
07How goes?
Insanely boring.
Slowly descending into madness.
tell me about it
The norm.
Complete boredom, and nostalgia.
XD
07Ah.
07=p
boredom is a virus that's slowly taking over the mind of humans ;x
nostalgia can be a powerful thing
Maybe I'll start hanging around again, IDK.

Do explain to me why people like using my profile images? ;x
The transparent black and white stuff...it's seriously boring derp
12lol
I'm not against you using it or anything, just extremely curious
12Ah, the profile layout template?
Sort of
12I don't really know, I just like how it looks XD
I think it looks boring ;x
it's just plain white/black
it's only the background which makes it somewhat interesting
12I've had two people ask me for the code to it before, lol
12It's all over the forums like wilf fire
I noticed
12wild*
...like, just yesterday.
Half of mine is based off Altair's, as in, the td[style] and tr[style] bits were off his
the body tags and such I coded as they're not very hard
seeing as it's standard CSS
I made the images though
o..o
12CSS can be confusing sometimes
12Fun though
CSS isn't confusing
just annoying
as for my idea of fun more like reflowing cold and bad solder joints
I was just doing that on a 1990 Delco AM stereo/FM stereo cassette car stereo
12D:
since they seem to drop dead of this problem
12Hello Bree
12^^
12:3
~
I almost have all the joints reflowed and touched up
C++ is annoying as heck.
12brb
k
12kk
12back
if I can pull the radio out I have another suffering from what I have started to call the Delco Plague
12wb
12thanks
12php can be pretty annoying too
PHP can be a b*tch
C++ is still wrose
worse*
I hate it
its an AM/FM stereo tuner in a 1986 Pontiac Grand AM which has a display that sometimes works and sometimes does not
/me is glad to have never used C++
12But I have seen the coding to it before
12Looks awful
http://andrewvos.com/2011/02/21/amount-of-profanity-in-git-commit-messages-per-programming-language/
(incl. profanities, ofc. nsfw. >pg)
orerr, nsfc
even worse than mIRCscript can be
well
I mean, C
and Java.
java is bad enough.
and the error debugging
mfw
12o-o
at least java isn't microsoft
/me hides
ew
;x
bbl dinner
bbl dinner
I wonder if some radio techs would be unhappy with what I do when aligning AM or FM tuners
I actually play music through whatever signal generator I happen to be using for the alignment
its far more entertaining and pleasant to hear than a continuous tone at a fixed frequency
plus depending on what I play I can have the generator hit 100% modulation quite easily
/me np: Ace of Base - Tokyo girl [03:36m/256kbps/44kHz]
ran across this song in an AMV before
and thought it was pretty cool despite being obscure

I have that song already
found it on the DVD
plus the song as it was featured in the ending sequence of said movie
which dvd?
the one you sent to me along with the two Pokemon box sets
yes I did explore it
oh
right
in fact that was one of the first things I did
put the disc into my laptop and look at the contents
after forcing Windows to not play the DVD video content
its really cool having that collection
basically every single Pokemon episode I could ever want in a high quality format on DVD
I have an annoying avatar issue after trying to create an animated one
I cannot create one under 100k and that is the limit for the forum

Fun fact: I have a cousin who, back in his primary school days, belonged to his school's falcon house
I have his house t-shirt so I could use the falcon motif on it's back as table or wall decor once I lay my hands on some tracing and contact paper
I make jokes about it

You need to have played their game that was on the Pokémon web site until May 5 oo
you DID play the game on pokemon.com angel...right?
13I did
13Twice
13>:/
but you chose the eeveelution you wanted at the end?
13Yep, I chose Espeon
13:<
huh
try going to the dream tree?
perhaps it'll automatically be available there?
While logged into your account?
13Yep, played it whilst logged in :/
I dont understand then
try looking on serebii for the info?
http://en.pokemon-gl.com/information/?infoto=121
13I can't work it out at all
13It's asking like I never played the mini-game at all :/
13*acting
it says you have to go on the promotions page
13I did
eh?
qualified?
what is it?
hopefully you got a new motherboard to go along with it
xD
I have no money
I got this one for $
$60
Cat: Pentium 4 3.6GHz 2 core with VM support
highlight me if you need me.
wow
Pentium 4s are fuckin' ancient
what a waste of money
13'Kay I've inquired the staff about this
13hopefully I'll get a response soon :/
/me plays with Angel's floof
/me watches
Cat: Its the best CPU my mobo will support
new motherboards are pretty cheap
you could have saved up
spending that much money on such archaic technology was foolish
How much is a mobo?
Cat: ^^
Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Dog.
depends entirely on what features you want
obviously
a decent (by which I mean by ASUS or Gigabyte) AM2+ or AM3 socket, full-ATX motherboard is about £50
Hmm
Does that include everything?
Cat: ^
it includes the motherboard
o.O
Cat: Anyways, this one suits me fine for now, I am using it for a server when I get my new comp in september, plus I have a laptop, and I am going to peru for the summer
The most my comp can support now is a p4, and I am not looking at major upgrades
Cat: How much do you think I can selll a pentium d for??
2.8GHz 2 core
very little
try ebay
but I doubt you'll get much
like $20 ?

3hmm
03SlyFox remember that spamfest yesterday?
and try being less "They all hate me".
03yous tarted calling me names

12You behave very immaturely, like refusing to leave when an admin asks you to.
3cuz
Mmm... pop tarts.
3u called me a name
03so that makes it OK to do the same?
He also insulted me on the other server before all of this happened :|
3yup
3 2 me
3:D
an eye for an eye only leaves the world blind.
12Ok will you leave now please?
That's my last line.
3y?
3i didnt do anything
12I gave one reason, they gave the rest.
3?
03Yeah, I left yesterday because I was about ready to ban you, I figured you'd rather I just leave :P
Bai Lakorv
03and I actually do need to leave soon, I'm going to the gym to work out (x.x)
06I'm not sure if asking will help, considering how the most obvious sarcasm in the world went right by him yesterday :P

Along with the server that the other came from

Then when I have that and all the quotes I got from Skylands from some of you, I will get an apology from her too and see if we can exchange them

/me is getting chews
07[23:23:01] <Xai> lol that was much fun <- xai, playing co-op was amazing. I want to play more of that game now XD
Looks good to me. Very sincere.
12Anyone else?
/me also chews Arti
you should play the single player - the story is sooo much fun
07:D
/me chews everyone with a chain gun!
12Kyu what do youj think? :3

I AM HEAVY WEAPONS GUY

07#
07We will all be trying our best to get along as usual, we hope you will do the same if you wish to return to us.
07Hm
Noo! Not Sasha! D:
07this one, I'm not sure
07it's supposed to be informal, yes?
12Does it sound bad?
07well
07it's run-on-y
/me cracks his knuckles "Here I cooome!"
07again
it sounds a lil' stuttering.
07sounds fine to me o3o
12Hey that one is only two lines long XD
07LOL
/me pokes Skyoko
07well I think it's because it's the 'as usual' part
07I DONT KNOW X
I think it's good too. I am curious on this thought, would an opening of "Dear Aurora," sound better than just "Aurora"?
07XD
12Maybe ^^;
I would poke the two 'we' startings.
10It's good
12Why Lakorv? :>
We [...], we [...].
12Mmm?
because repetition.
12hmm
07you sure like short sentences today 'korvu.
12Lol it's fine to repeat things like "I" or "We"
07arti
07maybe add an 'and' before the second we
07o3o
07that'd make it flow better
07it connects the sentence
and it sounds.. like it lacks some.. I'll just say 'glue' since I can't be bothered with vocab today.
12Oh wait I see
12I thought you meant the two separate paragraphs starting with We
07no it's the last sentence
12Yes I've added an And in there now
07also arti
07I saw your email
/me squish :>
12What did I say in it again? XD
/me runs
I'd say focus on the sincerity of the letter, rather than the grammar. lol
07LOOOL
12^^;
07just about discussing things, uh
07peadge
07I don't REMEMBER
12So everyone that is present just now.. would you mind if I added your names?
12To the list?
07Hm
all of us?
12If you want ^^;
07I dont feel like I was involved enough
12It's optional
I doubt you'd want my name on there, as I'm not really a TST'er..
07neither was Lakorv
07but
07o3o
07I dont mind, add my name to the floofin' list.
12^^
Go right ahead with mine. I actually miss seeing her around, even if I didn't talk to her much.
You can add me to the list if you would like.
06Add me (If I'm not already there)
07hm, how bouts Lakorvu?
06And exactly what Manly said lol
12Thanks ^^
13Me of course~
07!espeon
10Add me </obviously> :P
12XD
Me too :P
07I likes 'korvu.
07o3o
07I also
add me too i suppose XD
As I was one of the few who gave opinions :D
07like apostrophes.
/me kicked
13Apostrophes = flying commas? :D
you know
the apostrophe should go on the other side of my name
but fine :p
07why should it?
07o3o
Because La Korv'?
12would anyone here know if Feather would agree to this?
10Most likely
07well Lakorv, you never made the o a part of your name so technically, no
07what I'm taking away is the 'la' part
12Ok is it safe to add her name without asking do you think? ovO
07I'm seeing this
07as a name
07not two separate esperanto words
07in the case of you
07o3o
07although
07were it words in esperanto, then yes
07you'd be right
10Hm
07(without the connection to your nickname)
07pff
07I wish I had my editing functionality
07that sentence was bork
cue Cube taking action.
07No
07neverrr
Yup
07cube likes me
Flood
07don't tempt arti to kick me though LOL
12LOL
12HAPPY FEEEESH XD

/me say fish and immediately thought of the song "So Long and Thanks For All the Fish.." XD
/me yawns
02Homework is endless
02;__;
12Would you know if Lati would add her name if we asked?
Saw*
12I know she's not around but I was wondering if you were able to speak on her behalf
12and if you don't mind Skylands ^v^;
13Most likely, yeah :3 even though I don't think they've really spoken that much before xD
12Ok ^^
12I best leave her off
12Oh and FYI, I asked DRF too before he left and he was ok with it :>
07I likes Aurora.
13Add Minnet to the list :D
/me hides
12XD
07LOOOOOL
/me whines
07I love Minnet.
figures.
No swearing :<
13I'm pretty sure ;; Sorry I can't make it...
07.-.;
07I can be quiet
pff.
/me will try and find a way anyway..
12What if your travel was paid for?
12I mean if I get a new job before then I will have enough :D
13It'll be hard to explain that to my parents ^^; They really don't approve of me meeting people irl that I met online
Forget your parents jk jk
13I've had to lie my way to being able to meet up with Lati, they think she's someone I knew when I was little .-.;
/me shot.
12:((((
07Hm
07I'd just tell them you'd met some friends of friends.
07but that's me. o3o
12XD
well
you told people we met through a mutual friend so as to make them think we met not far from where you live.
07lolyeah
twisting truth. It works.
07I don't really want to mention the particular irc network... <__<;
07I mean, floof
rofl
07I was fine mentioning TST for the other people I was with, but that's because most people know of Pokemonstuffs and that I chill around this site anyway
07but
07that other network? Lolno, even if I'm not a furry, I don't want to be thought of that way haha
people are scaringly nearsighted.
07well, not that - but honestly
07it'd indirectly tell them something about you that you might want to regulate yourself
13Arti
I'm nearsighted and farsighted ;D
13He's willing to add his name to the list
07even if I can explain my stance, they'd still be free to draw conclusions regarding you
13:3
lol
'that' network ;p
lol
07indeed

Have you ever watched it? If you do that might clear your confusion (or it might not).
4I have
It did for me
4Actually.
I didn't get it either
until I started watching it
4 episodes in, I'm starting to like it
4First two episodes
4Didn't understand it
4Well I did
First two are a bad example.
4but not why it was popular
yeah first two didn't get me
The first two aren't much like the rest of the episodes.
it wasn't until after that
Episode 7's pretty good.
Isukra
Yeah
She just left my house

tiem to draw
12yay
If you've only watched the first two episodes I'm not that surprised that you're not keen on it, I wasn't too sure about them, it gets better the more you watch it in my opinion.
4Maybe after I finish X-men Evolution
That's proving true for me as well
Watching the episodes through for the second time I'm finding them all even funnier for some reason.

Oh, and I've seen that Fluttershy image that's on Rarity's dressing screen as part of the background decoration on her walls.

O__o
Stay cooooooool.
He would have liked that
I don't see why everyone's making such a big deal about the rapture thing anyway
it's just one guy who said that
a handful of followers
/me snaps his fingers. "Aw, maaaan."
but nobody else that I know of
Yes, but he's already made millions of dollars off of them.
People have quit their jobs and abandoned their kids to go with him.

Yeah, Tacnayn isn't as happy though.
03well bbl
Dari, how is that you can stay up all night every night?
I've wondered this as well
It's not every night, and it's not usually all night.
Every night I'm on you're here. xD
:P

Well I don't have any exams till Tuesday so I'm taking a break (from doing little work anyway :D).

"My friend Darius loves you
LOL
Hahaha.
Oh wow, he's actually doing this in public
I'll post it myself.
Nyan
I'll beat you to it
no
I... admire his courage, I guess?
we should both do it
proving the fact
"My friend Darius loves you"
"Yes. Yes I do."
Done
Posted
His smile is really creeping me out
I didn't realise immediately that it was a mirror and I thought "OMG THERE'S TWO OF THEM!".

you don't need water when you can generate spit.
That doesn't really prove she likes ponies though
There are old ponies on that necklace too

03I seriously can't wait until I get a new router
03this one is pissing me off
6what's it doing?

03it's giving me like a 1 bar signal down here
03I'm in my basement

03bye
03anyway
ditch it

6a character from an anime
03I'm going to wire up a long Ethernet cable
03I just have to drill a hole in the floor
wired ftw
03than PoE
03er
03not PoE
EoP?
03xD
03something like that yeah
PoS is more like it
lol
I bet you if I was near you I could jam your connection with ease
03LOL
03...?
03how would you do that
just send out a signal on 28 MHz
CONNECTION TERMINATED
(he has tons of radio equipment)
!say la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la Katamari Damancy~
la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la Katamari Damancy~
03wait
03I'm confused
03it's Damacy btw
03but anyway
ethernet over powerline uses the HF or high frequency radio spectrum
stupid n
:P
clump spirit ftw?
03Ethernet powerline uses 28kHz?
plus household wiring was not designed to carry RF so it leaks in and out
no
it uses 3 to 30 MHz
03not quite sure how that works
that is an example
03it sends radio signals through the wires? o_O
yes
03er MHz not Khz my bad
which leak out like crazy
ever heard of carrier current AM?
03nope
it actually takes advantage of that characteristic
orer, it sends signals at radio frequency over power lines.
no RF shielding for electrical wiring
its about the same concept
except carrier current AM deliberately uses this where as for ethernet over powerline this is a side effect
no surprise you have not heard of it drf, its been fading away in recent years
03EW, Game Show network HD stretches their shows
carrier current AM was most commonly used at colleges and universities which have broadcasting courses because it used to be required for those on over the air AM or FM stations to have a special FCC license even if they did not do any engineering
no
03Misty is in about half of them :P
link them again
I was away from home
03one sec
baseball game
if its true HD I might make a modified Blu Ray image once you get the Pokemon Heroes/Destiny Deoxys ISO uploaded
03http://imgur.com/a/rorRy#AnxWo
03well look for yourself
03some scenes look HD, others don't
replacing Destiny Deoxys with Pokemon 4Ever
that does not look too bad
movies 4 and 5
the Blu Ray bundle I would have done
and I would have put Jirachi Wishmaker and Destiny Deoxys in another one
03you want the TS file?
sure
03It's missing about 2 minutes of credits due to Starz being stupid and airing it 45 minutes late, but otherwise yeah
just need to unplug the power supply under test
I finally put new filter capacitors in the 25 amp Tripp Lite power supply so that is what was being tested
it kicks a bit when switched on and the beast of a transformer hums but its working perfectly
03o.o
UGGGGGH
SO MUCH GARBAGE ON WARPED
this is normal though
it did that with the original 6800 uF 25 volt capacitors
it's out already?
no I'm looking at the damn setlist for my day
the two bands listed for warped tour that I WANTED TO SEE ARE NOT ON MY DATE and now there's SCREAMO GARBAGE overflowing this list.
ugh.
http://vanswarpedtour.com/event/id/38167
I found a scene pony
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXFj_u6Xus
20:26
listen for it
I thought rainbow dash was a scene pony
I am amused at some of the DirecTV promos
for one they pitch most full time HD channels and yet they have one that I know of which is just part time
inb4: indirectV
Cartoon Network HD
they have lots of shows there which are pillarboxed or upscaled from what I have seen in the guide
although it does not matter to me because all I watch on there is King Of The Hill
and its mostly SD

hey ^^

Hai
that "you came back" thing is kinda gettin old :P
12that's why i mixed it up
12with Drake
04hi
12hi
03ugh
03I just ran an Eithernet cable from the router to the basement, and Xbox Live is still having lots of voice breakouts x.x
03it came from having the cable in a large spool, when I tried to pull it through the small hole I drilled it got kinda kinked
03but wires are wires no?
03and i thought Ethernet just had like 4 small wires
interference with itself./-+induction mb?
ormb one of the wires inside the cable is shorted/broke?
use a cont tester/multimeter
03not sure
03o.o
03well
they're cheap, like $10-20
03when I'm done on Xbox Live, I'll plug it into my laptop and do a speed test
very useful.
03I'm thinking it could just be the router
03being dumb
mb
03and ooh
03Travel Channel is doing an Extreme marathon on the 28th
fma & nick can attest the usefulness of a multimeter.
03including Extreme Towns, a special that talks about hell, Michigan
03and I now get Travel HD
I already saw a NEWS SEGMENT FROM HELL
literally
WLIO TV in Lima Ohio aired it on October 31st 2010
I just used one today during the power supply tests
the first real load it drove with the new filter capacitors was a car stereo
plus I even saw some with frequency counters as well
those seem to go up to just 20 MHz at the most sadly
well, even if you aren't an electricalhead, it's still useful, buy wan, it's cheap, and we'll walk you through when you need.
yes
the only thing that might be confusing is measuring current
I once read a Youtube comment where someone came up with two fictional Chipmunks compilations and bust up laughing
The Chipmunks Sing The Beatles and also The Chipmunks Sing The Bee Gees but sadly the second of the two can only be heard by dogs
rawr I'm hungry
xD

because I watched Nickelodeon almost exclusively in the 1990s
the one with worms popping out of an apple I remember being just before the very first airing of Rugrats!
12obsessed 8D
not really
12with nick and radios
I was a little kid at the time so I am a bit shocked I was able to recall it from real life
12it's a very good memory yes o3o
I have something of a photographic memory
12since most kids have an attention span of 2 seconds

partially because Doug was actually one of my favorite shows
it features Doug and his dog Porkchop
12meh i never watched cartoons when i was a kid
12i thought it was too... childish
12i know, irony
12lol, I almost never think anything is childish XD
same here
I mean I still revisit and watch things from my childhood
12I watch new stuff I have never seen before, that some people would call childish
I am not entirely stuck in the past though but will admit with some TV shows that is the case
Hello!! I'm spyrorullz
Is anyone there??
HELLO????????
Sorry about that.
12i miss megas xlr
12But really, if you like it, why not watch it? It don’t matter what other people think
Please is anyone there? I need to ask some questions about spyro!!!
Please
Pokemon is one show where admitedly I am permanently stuck in the past
Well if no one is answering i'm going

yeeees
12Well, looks like I have to go D:
12Good night
12night
I can confirm that sadist was defined appropriately
na narcicist is someone who takes value only in themselves
that is correct as well
and to give some background on it better than I could myself here is a news clip

TAB
/me steals Portal 2 from Arti along with 2500$ for the trip
12:(
Now I can fulfill your demands :3
(Tab key, it ruins relationships)
12I wish Lugia WAS around today >v> I need him to tell me where to find a tiny bit of code he wrote among thousands of lines D:
07Articuno
07he told me he would be, oddly ebough
07enough
07and meep!
12How is that odd, he always says he'll be here and then never shows up XD
07I really enjoyed playing co-op with Xai XD
07LOL
12Trust me, Xai loved it too ^^
12Keep playing
07LOL I was SO worried though
12When he's around.. lol
07i mean
07i was constantly thinking
07'geez I must have such a weird accent'
07LOL!!!!!
12I was actually saying to Xai LOL she sounds so cute
07aw ^-^
07I didnt realise it when you meeped at me at first
07I was like
12I hadn't heard you in ages
12and LOL
07'the heck - OH ARTI'
07YOU TWO MAKE LIFE A BRIGHTER PLACE JUST SO YOU KNOW XD
6so much blue and orage
6PURPLE
6INTTERUPTION
Portal 2
6er
12LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
6*interruption
Blue and Orange
12Aww ^^
Altas and P-Body
6blue and orange is a beautiful combo though
07Aurora, the updated, altered interrupting falcon+
07?
12Yeh, if only I could make that artwork I always invisiged
You play blue, hawk takes orange
Perfect,
12I would love to, but I'd prefer to let her and Xai play together first
12Xai wants to play a lot more than me
07really?
07i just need a time, honestly =p
12yeh I mean I like playing but I want to do other things as well
12Whereas Xai just doesn't have anything else to do but play so it's all he does XD
07aw XD
07I see
12So I'd rather let him play you or he'd get upset that I'm playing you when I don't really want to as much as him XD
07I'm a bit sad though, I want to do things together with Lakorvu but he runs friggin Linux which ... just doesnt like Portal 2 obviously.
12and he knows I won't play Co-op with him again any time soon XD
07and ah
07XD
12Meh >v>
12This is why Linux SUCKS ;3
/me runs

07I CAN AGREE WITH YOU THERE.

07Xai is also fun to talk with!
12lol sometimes he talks too much XD
07haha
6kyuuuuuubey STARES INTO YOUR SOUL
07I normally feel very self conscious when cooperating with others (Arrow put me down a lot and would yell at me for being a 'bad' team player) but I didn't with Xai, so kudos to him for not being fear inspiring at all

ERROR: UNIVERSE RESTARTING IN 3... 2... 1...

6I'm making a plush

03you should turn that into a rap

12Concentrating now ^^;
Get one from LinkSys
13Kyubey :D ?
/me shoots herself for late replies
6yes :>
6life size
13AWESOME
13I want one D:
03WTF is wrong with these WMV files
6I have one week to make it
03inb4 "the fact that they're WMV"
03but basically I leeched a stream
03and I can't seek them
03at all
13Wait, how would you make the floating ring things? |D
I could have got a Linksys one if not for the fact that my phone line is a digital one that hooks up to my ISP's router as well
03o.o
6....I don't know yet
03ISP router
6I'm still making the pattern
03we have digital phone too but it hooks up to the *modem*
03they didn't give us a router
2Wire, with some ISP branding
03which I suppose is a good thing XD
13Well either way, I'm sure it'll look amazing when you're done :3
03the one I want to get is a Buffalo super high power one
I think my router doubles up as the modem
Or something
Which sucks
Also, what plush Roara?
03I'm hoping that boosts the signal strenght quite a bit
03yeah, I hate those
03because if your connection dies you have to reset both x.x
03yeah
Yeah
6http://i261.photobucket.com/albums/ii50/Mexicos_Son/Kyubey.jpg
6that thing
So, that's where the floating rings come in
03wtf is that from anyway
6yeh
6an anime called puella magi madoka magica
03oh
6which apparently a lot more people on TST know about than I thought
Some strange thing happened on my bus home today
6I just heard about it this week and watched it
6and yeh
The bus I was on had an electronic display that displays the name of the next bus stop
I fell asleep on the bus
It was already at the bus station, the last stop, when I woke up
03because that's kinda a HoSHiNET meme XD
So I happened to look up at the electronic display, and it was displaying the acronym of the bus company's bus depot. oo
6ok yeah I watched a couple episodes of that
6because Aero told me to
6NEVER AGAIN
lol AeroInfluence
03XD
03I might watch it when they dub it
Roara, Aero got you into Touhou as well
6yeah everything that happens to me is aero's fault
03and yes, they are going to dub it
6touhou, PMMM...yeh

13Lol wut
13why do people think the world's ending tomorrow
13LOL
06lolrapture
6Ah, that.
6I heard about that about an hour ago from my classmates.
06how many "end of the world" dates has been set anyway? 400 or so? xD
6apparently that's supposed to be the day of judgment
06and we're Still Aliiiive~
6when jesus comes to judge the world lol
6dunno who started that one
06Well, we'll see I guess :P
06And I'll refrain from obligatory loltvtropes comments. Oh wait
/me flops
6:>
06But yeah, I've heard that there has been over 400 dates already where "a reasonable amount of people" believed that the world would end o.O but I can't remember where I read it >.>
13I just think there are some crazy people out there who REALLY want the world to end
13|D
6Eh, if science holds true, then the world won't naturally end for another few billion years.
6But people can change that.
06Probably just people who wish they could ctrl+z in real life. Or wait, that's all of us...
6which is why on december 22, 2012
6I;ll be here

12What’s your reasons for not liking Anime, HML? Just curious
Can't be bothered
Are bleh
:P
Then the plots and characters
12I only watch official dubs
6that's stereotyping an entire universe of media
12Ewww fan dubs
06I don't even have an opinion on anime because
06it doesn't interest me enough for me to even watch it~
6I'm not much for anime
6but some series I find amazing
6for the most part though
6it's a bleh
Which is why I don't watch it every night and day @ Espeon ;3
12I am very picky with most shows however, both anime and non-anime
06I wonder how many ~'s I've used.
/me dies
12~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
12~ is spectacular
12Espeons particularly like it for some reason
06It adds that
06squiggly touch
06to everything
/me 6just found out Swampert's Japanese name is Laglarge.

03and now I'm too busy watching MythBusters
6lol
03this one is all about shooting people
03they're trying to see if people really fly backwards when shot
03so they're shooting a pig
6does it involve shooting them underwater?
6oh
03they even open fired at it with a machine gun
03and nothing XD
6mythbusters is awesome lol
03a massive shotgun made it flinch a little but nowhere like Hollywood
03Yeah it is
03it's on Science channel if you want to tune in :P
03oh wait, it's about to go to commercial
03http://www.speedtest.net/result/1305095273.png <- so, I ran an Ethernet cable down to my basement here by drilling a hole in the floor XD

6no I don't have the patience to get that much wool
03unless you pay for basic cable xD
03but I have the premium cable so :>
06because mining obsidian is rage-inducing, and wool is just annoying
lol
03and two, you can't record it on your computer
go buy a full cable drf
03I can record everything on my PC :P
03including HD movie channels
6oh none of that is obsidian
6it's all wool
03I'd love to see you try that with satellite
06IF THAT EVEN IS OBSIDIAN if not then that's a lot of wool and then
06oh
06ok

13When a friend of mine puts "5 inches :(" as their status on FB, I can't help but comment |D
yuka <3
... lol
6lets just go ahead with patchouli's nondirectional laser lol
that marisa jacked?
13THOSE LASERS
13I hate them so much
13forcing me in one direction
13;;
6lol ikr
Yukari is worse :p
6one direction, while bullets EVERYWHERE-
6OH GOD YUKARI LOL
I've actually managed to pass that nightmare LOL
6she may be my favorite character, but I am terrified of her phantasm fight
6THERE IS NO GOD
but yeah
13I want to fight Yukari so much
13partly for the awesome music
Yukari's stage isn't really that hard
6ok my problem with PCG
6*PCB
6I can't even get past youmu LOL
6she destroys me
6for reasons I don't know
~
6she destroys me in CtC as well
13is it weird that my biggest motivation for unlocking extra modes is for the music that the EX boss has? |D
I wanna use her spirit to clean my teeth.
6lol
k the easiest extra boss is swako
suwako
nuff said
13I have to agree, even though I haven't beaten her yet
6I've only played against flandre and mokou
mokou just.. ugh
I hate her spellcards so much
13hasn't taken me nearly as long to get through her spellcards as it did for me when I fought Mokou
6...dude, I can't get past MoF
6it's a hard game for me
6I dunno why
13took me many months of on/off playing to beat Mokou
MoF is actually pretty hard
the easiest game is IN
13and I've never been able to beat her again since then |D
hi all, what you guys talking about?
6see, that's what I said
6but a lot of people think MoF is the easiest
lolwat
Kanako isn't kidding
13I find MoF pretty easy overall
13it's just Kanako and Sanae that I hate fighting xD
6dude
6kanako
Sanae is a good girl
6SO MUCH PAIN
|3
13Also, Kanako's last spellcard is so much easier on normal mode than easy mode, LOL
i know this lol
That's a running meme
also
siki lunatic is hax
6I never even got to her last one ;-;
12Hi
6siki?
sikieiki
12!espeon
6shikieiki
6THAT WHOLE GAME is hax
hm
XD
6seriously
6wait one sec
well, I generally play on lunatic
13Awesome, I know a pro Touhou player! :D
6about sums it up
OHYA
Ten Desires is supposed to be the easiest game yet
said zun
6that's what he's saying
6at least, along the same lines of IN
He wants it aimed more towards a general audience lolololol
/rage
6I actually had a fairly tough time on the third stage
third stage is always hard :/
6I can beat it now, but more trouble than expected
normally harder than the fourth
6no, 5TH stage is hard
unless it's LOLREIMUMARISA in IN
6I swear....ever 5th stage EVER
ugh
6...
6ok well that's just horrible lol
13Marisa is easier than Reimu
6I still can't decide which of those two is easier
6I'd say marisa
6but
6stars
Reimu is LOL
6MESS YOU UP
13either that or I'm just more used to playing against Marisa xD
Angry birds > Touhou :3
/me mauled
Her stuff has no pattern.
At all.
6and then she pulls out master spark, and once again
6there is no god
She just randomly spouts stuff.
Blazing Star = TROLOLOLOL
13LOL THAT
13I still haven't captured that
13I've come close a few times though
i've actually managed to capture yukari's extra card
13The fact that the entire screen shakes when the laser appears screws me over
13damn 4th wall breaking :<
also
the first game I 1cc'd was SA
That was fun
13o-o
I love Parsee and Satori's music
6I still need to beat SA on normal
ahaha
6I beat it on easy within like 3 tries
13I find SA to be the most difficult LOL
Utsuho is hax
GIANT BULLETS
6UTSUHO IS THE DEFINITION OF HAX
And a black hole spellcard
13Okuu~~
6all for one reason
13Black Hole spellcard is pretty fun xD
Orin is harder than okuu tho :/
13^
Easily
6Hell and Heaven Meltdown
6lose one life, be forever lost
AE! If you have requests for my show, Now might be a good time to tell me them
XD
Okuu is just insult to injury as a stage six boss LOL
6^pretty much that
13I want to unlock Extra mode, because SA's extra mode has the best music IMO
13|D
And WTF Koishi's extra
Hearts coming out of her skirt.
6I don't like koishi's theme
6much
SA has best extra stage them
theme
13I like how chaotic the music sounds :D
6don't like her stage much either LOL
CLOSELY contested with GFW extra
6fairy wars
6is a ridiculous game LOL
I still haven't reached Fairy Wars extra LOL
13I love how one of Koishi's spellcards looks rather...
That game is so hard.
It's not even funny
6same
6I can get to the second boss
6and die
13I've been meaning to play that
13|D
I can 1cc it
6angel, prepared to rage
If I sit for like five hours
6endlessly
That's how I 1cc'd UFO
12http://cheezcomixed.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/koma-comic-strip-but-ta-toes-are-sentient-now.jpg XD
6I don't like uFO
Shou's curvy lasers made me RAGE
6I can't get myself to play it
13EW CURVY LASERS
6but I want to play it so I can play against byakuren and eventually nue
6but it's the one game i actually dislike the characters
13UFO has the worst characters overall, but that's my opinion xD
ehh
13The only character I like is Nue
the only respectable characters are the stage 3 boss, stage 4 boss, and the extra
lol
I love muramasa
back
(japanese name)
13I haven't actually played any of the official games for a while now
13I've been hooked on CtC |D
sanae is a good girl ~.~
Hopefully she gets retired after TD
I hate her character so much
13A lot of the music in that game, I actually like better than what they were like in the official games |D
also TD might herald the return of MIMA O__________________O
6I'm still working on playing CtC and actually BEATING IT
13Sanae's one of my favourites xD
Dad killed a poor fox
6yukari's theme in that game is probably my favorite song ever
yukari's theme is actually night fall
not necrofantasia
imo
necrofantasia is just a remix of rans theme
6some of the remixes I've heard for necrofantasia defiintely fit yukari
6but yeah, evening star is definitly hers
lol
13I like Patchouli's theme in CtC better than in EoSD
Even though evening star in 10.5 is all LOL I'M FRENCH.
13also the combination of Chen and Ran's theme on stage 4 is <3

12I have an appointment today.
02Yeah?
12Psychologist or something similar.
02Neurologist for me :3
12How'd it go?
06HHeya Shiny
02He said that the medicine is definitely working, and that he wants a lumbar puncture to make sure. He also wants me to get an MRA to make sure there's no clotting in the back of my head.
SHINY~ *glomps* x3

02Lol
Wait, O.o
How'd you get that?
02The doctors don't know
12Sounds a little dangerous
Sounds very dangerous ;P
06lumbar puncture .-.
06Something tells me that sounds more painfull than it is, but I might be totally wrong D:
*does a mr popo face "Hiii"
Very painful
02They say it's common in people who are morbidly obese, though I'm only obese...the doctor said that I"m just unlucky
Ew needles x.x
Ah o.o
/me does this http://i56.tinypic.com/25i7j8k.jpg
02The doctor told me that they numb the area so I only feel a prick when they do the puncture
06And ah, I see
02<3
12Good.
06:)
o.o
I hate needles :<
Anything sharp, I go crazy
02PECKING ORDER
06I really don't have a problem with needles. I used to, but it just vanished o.o
02Haha, today after we talked to the doctor we had to go get schedules from different departments, well we went to the place called The Lab
06LOL Mr. Popo face
SHINY!
/me huggles
02And I didn't know why we were going in there, turns out once they called me in, they wanted my blood xD
/me hugs back
12It's just kind of a burning sensation that doesn't usually last, so I'm not terrified of it.
...
Blood tests are the worst
12o.o
02Eh, wasn't that bad
I'm deathly afraid of them you know :P
And the worst part is
It takes them ages to find a good vein
The whole family has this issue too XD

028D
/me 12currenly has her hair tied back
04Ray
04What HR are you, and what weapon/armour were you using?
04And what game is it?
/me 12stares at the Forum Games part of TST
02In order:
02HR only 9, I want to play the story first.
02Weapon of choice: Switch Axe
02Armor: R. Ludroth complete set (I'm to lazy to get another one)
02I'm HR nine
02...ty one
02Now, The lagiacrus >D
04lol
02(Inb4: Death)
04If you're going for Rathian I suggest the Qurupeco armour.
04Fire Resistance.
04And the Barroth armour for Lagiacrus because it's the only one I can remember that has thunder resistance.
02No wai Lyon
04Of course I've never been good at suggesting armours.
02If you're going to fight Rathian, totally go in Leather Armor
04I never use skills right 8D
04lol
02You'll be amazed how much more skills you get out of it that way
04Really?
/me looks
02In running and dodging I mean
02Oh and don't forget screaming
02LOL
04XD
02I remember when I fought my first Rathian
02The Rathian was a pain with this armor
02I was still in leather armor
02R. Ludroth is weak to fire, that's why :P
02Anyways, I was so scared I was running around in circles screaming my head off
04XD
04I used Barroth armour for it.
04I used Barroth armour for nearly everything. After the amount of time I spent farming for the materials, I wasn't going to let that time go to waste/
02But at this time I was fighting a Qurepeco and it called Rathian D:
04Hahahaha
02And I never decided on a good armor set until I fought Rathalos(I had almost all Gobul armor, but changed quickly once Rathalos came)
02I posted a bit in there
02Hey
Hi shiny
02now... any protips for fighting the lagiacrus?
02Use fire, dodge his electric attacks, kick him in the face
04Stay on your toes. When he starts swimming around, get moving because he'll be ready to charge at you with either an electrified charge or a water one.
02If this is your urgent mission, he'll already be on the ground when you start off, so go to town right away
12:D
06Pandas :3
02Obviously my advice was better
04He takes the most damage from cutting attacks to his chest.
02Yes
04So aim there. If you use a blunt weapon, attack his head.
02So much cuddlefluff
06The tail is as big as its body
06<3
02The way it should be <3
02Like me
02I'm a hammer user
02HAMMER
04I'm a LS/GS/SnS user.
02They need to come out with a new weapon class
04I just can't get used to the hammer.
02BANHAMMER or normal HAMMER?
02The DUAL HAMMERS
04XD
02XD
06Oh yes
04Throwing hammers.
02Hmm, should I cut its tail before anything?
04Or Greathammer.
04GUN HAMMER
12^v^
04Ray, focus on his tail when on land. It's easier to cut it off while it's on land.
04Once in the water, go for his head and chest and break them.
04Wait
02Gunhammers too
04is this the Repel mission or the Hunt mission?
02Just like there are gunlances
02GUNHAMMERSPLZ
Ohai
04rawr
hi
02Hunt
04Ok, then follow our advice.
12meep?
04When he gets tired, he'll jump up onto the beach to rest. Use this time to set bombs around his head and explode them into his face.
02Here's my advice for hunting Lagiacrus: Hit Lagiacrus
04That's the general strategy for any sleeping monster.
02With that, you shall do well
04lol
02traps?
04His double hipcheck is frustrating as hell.
13Don't monsters take like half an hour to kill on that game? |D
02Pitfall for land, shock for water
04If you're having trouble hitting a certain body part, then yes use traps.
02'k
04Espy, most do.
How's it going for you?
04Online though, they take like, 5-10 minutes 'cause you all gang up on it.
I'm doing alright
02Just depends on if you have a good enough weapon, and how good you are at hitting the monster to do enough damage
04Bah weep granna no bongo?
02Yeah, online it's easier because you're usually in a group of 4 beating on one monster that only has a bit more extended life
02Rathian took me 45 mins .__.
04Try hitting it's head.
02Soon it will only take you 20
04You deal ALOT more damage.
04Hell
02SHOOT IT IN THE HEAD
02SHOOT IT IN THE HEAD
04Rathian only takes me ten-fifteen minutes
12wtf? O_o
04But Rathalos...dear god I hate that thing
02Imagine what it takes me, with my Jho hammer
04lol
04Did you see that video Manly took?
04It took him like, 30 seconds.
02Yeah lol
02.___.
02Link or die
04I don't have it unfortunately.
04But it was amazing.

02He used something called "Headlocking"
04And it was AMAZING
02basically where he did a combo that made it so the Rathian could only flinch and nothing else
02Easy to do with overpowered weapons

02Eh, I don't hold it against anyone really to know much about me.
02My friends IRL know little to nothing about me.
Lols
02I just don't have a clue what to say
02I feel my life is too dull and boring to really just write down for others to read
02Well not even my life, maybe just my personality
04Ohey a Bird Wyvern Gem

In this anime pretty much everything is a robot, and things are SPLODING all the time. Sea monster robots, main characters are robots, robot soldiers, robot sharks, robot flying stuff.
12:>
sounds boring
12;-;
It's alright, just a bit repetitive. Go here, SPLODE, go there SPLODE.
It's interesting because all the characters are pretty unique in looks.

Nope.

They skipped most of the adverts though.
They need to get Meowth's voice actor

03these are LED backlight

12i love LED
the LED bars that we have for my school's sound and lighting system
they keep f*cking up
and it's so annoying
we had the school musical last night (and tonight in a few hours)
and in the first act they most wonderfully had to freeze
/me yawns loudly
02I'm going to sleep~
which basically ends up as me and my team not being able to control them at all
so we had a full blackout at the end of the first act, and the f*cking LED bars were still on

I actually watched a bit about wire recorders
it actually is possible to record audio on a piece of wire
wut
this was done before magnetic tape became common in the US
and in various other parts of the world
magnetic tape was if I remember right invented in Germany
in the 1930s

12o-O
there is a remix which starts like that
12lol
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rasp88nbsRw&feature=related
15KV singing electric arc
very cool but not something I would like to build
it just seems a bit too dangerous
actually 60KV
not 15
60,000 volts
looks like the modulation that arc uses is FM or PM going by the oscilloscope
12needs more 1.21 JIGAWATTS!
that is power
12i know
not voltage
high voltage and high current is not easily obtained
12and ohms is resistence
usually its one or the other
12and amps is current
right
12left
named after a man named Ampere who was French I think
12don't remember
when studying electricity one assignment I had was figuring out the namesake for each unit and what country they were from
Ohm is named after George Simon Ohm from Germany
Watt was named after James Watt from the UK
Volt was named after Alessandro Volta from Italy
12hmm
he invented the capacitor if I remember right
03well I'm going to bed
ok
night
12night
I will be leaving my current home soon
but maybe the best way to think of it as a new beginning rather than the end
12or both
12where there is an end is a new beginning
right
as Semisonic's most famous song goes
"Every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end"
12hmm
I found that when classical music, downloads are more liekly to be in FLAC. yay !
I like mp3 better ;p
good for you.
mp3 is not that good a compression format
especially for recompression
I am not surprised about that point jun
(demographics prolly)
classical music listeners tend to be very consious about sound quality
&also, classical music is usually quieter, and hence compresses to a smaller size than pop music, for lossless codecs
in fact listen to just about any radio station playing classical music and you will hear lighter processing
yes
also the dynamic range can be quite high
some pop songs have wide dynamic range too
yep, concertFM here is frickquiet compared to the pop stations next to it.
that is the norm
jazz stations are about the same way
dynamics are quite important in that genere too
i don't think i have a dedicated jazz station here, but concertFM sometimes plays jazz
there is one near me
KPLU 88.5 which is NPR
they play LOTS of jazz
plus I heard a jazz station on AM as well
KBSU 730 Boise Idaho
interesting given most AM radios are a piece of sh*t these days
narrowbanded, muddy and distorted audio, and insensitive
I listened to them on an AMAX certified Sony SRF-42 AM stereo/FM stereo Walkman
and they sounded incredible at the time
the AMAX tuners have a treble response up to 15,000 Hz normally with some making it up to 20,000 Hz
my Delco UX-1 car radio has a frequency response of 20 to 20,000 Hz on AM!
excelent engineering on the AM section but I have to deal with some bad adjustment slugs which cause it to work only intermittently

ooh
12tie
Caserin!
and I think I will keep that
12ok
actually wanted to breed a whole bunch of Luvdisc
and believe it or not I have a pair of them
12i only ever went after luvdisc because they carry heart scales sometime
nicknamed Caserin and Luverin
they are not the greatest but can hold their own
12hmm
the reason for the two nicknamed ones is obvious
those two are at the Cerulean City gym
12i see o-O
Caserin is owned by Misty and Luverin by Daisy
12?
its TV show related
any doubts its in Pokemon Chronicles
the episode is Luvdisc Is A Many Splendored Thing
12never saw it
/me spies on Zoroark
not surprised
I have seen it several times
12o-o
even have it on DVD
12yay :3
I actually own Pokemon's entire original series on DVD along with five Advanced Generation episodes
and four Pokemon Chronicles episodes
12i have all the movies and a bunch of pokemon VHS tapes
12that's about it
much of what I have is on DVD
Isukra what are you doing awake you should probably be asleep
12i'm awake
12deal with it :<
np
no
12how goes
I just have two Pokemon VHS tapes which are mostly for collectable purposes
12lol
12nowadays yes
plus the quality is bad compared to the DVDs
fuzzy and low resolution
12ahh
the DVDs are much sharper and clearer
i just got done delivering papers
i am fairly tired but I think I'll try to stay awake until about 3 PM
12ok
not to mention they are far more compact
better quality, smaller size, and more episodes in the same space taken up by just one VHS tape which only has a few
12nod
my region 1 NTSC Orange Islands set takes up the space of just one VHS tape and includes that ENTIRE portion!
technically VHS is infinite resolution; it's bounded by the fact it's analogue and can't practically go past a certain focus level
same goes for the region 4 PAL sets of Johto Journeys and Johto League Champions
no
in a theoretical sense
the bandwidth available on a VHS tape is HIGHLY limited
only by practicality
plus S-VHS did not catch on in the home
and D-VHS was a flop
I still hate dealing with VHS tapes due to the poor picture quality
along with dropouts and head noise
yeah of course
i just don't watch videos
the dropouts you can reduce by cleaning the heads which I try to but you can't get rid of all of them
:33c
head noise you can't deal with except on a computer after digitizing the tape
plus they wear out over time
also VHS-- yeah
the picture quality deteriorates with every playback
shelf life etc.
DVDs still look the same as they did when they were first pressed no matter how many times they are viewed
3.141592653589793238dove
/me hides
same can be said for laserdiscs
unless you have a bad player that scratches it or something
even though like VHS tapes they are analog
yea
but I never had that experiencce
*experience
all the players I dealt with have been well built
Isukra < some chronicles http://www.mediafire.com/?aaxpj2zk8q9ix
i haven't had any like that actually
but it's possible
yes
no two mechanisims are alike
same here
but I might look at other episodes just out of curiosity
Return To The Starting Line looks interesting
I have already seen all the Cerulean City episodes
including some of the Japan only intros that never made it to the US!
bleh
the Japanese intros have Misty (Kasumi) and Brock (Takeshi) introducing the episode and toward the end Misty hits Brock with some random object to snap him out of his skirt chasing mode
I find them quite silly
but like them

of course in Japanese but the effects are quite dramatic
those who can read Japanese might figure it out by the listing in the title says AM stereo
NIPPON UUAM STEREOUUUU
hai
they really made a big deal about this
when the Japanese government legalized AM stereo in 1992
right off the bat Motorola's system was picked and Tokyo already had stereo sound being heard on 954, 1134, and 1242 from day one
which was JOKR (TBS) JOQR (Bunka Hosa) and JOLF (Nippon Hoso)

Ive been trying to figure it out buit can't
Ah
He might have removed it, not sure
you could try /addline it, if you have the flag
but addline is icky ;x
what I also wanna ask if when you watch a music tribute video if in the video sometimes the beat of the voice matches the scences of the pictures excactly and that it makes you feel in tuned with the song itself
12Lol I've never used it and don't know if I want to risk it xD
I asked other people but they said that they don't know
do you guys know?
Well, the problem with addline is that once you add the line to the config, you can't delete it without accessing it
So if you make a mistake
You can't fix it without going into the file and editing it again

I would perfer HDMI, but time for a couple of converters XD

HDMI is nice

Funny thing is
No TVs or computers use HDMI
my school's sound and lighting system's VGA port
In this house ;P
oo
the cable thing is attached to a metal panel that's drilled into the wall
Either DVi-D, VGA or Component :o
hi
Metal panel wat
yeah
the cable keeps falling back into the wall ;x
then I have to spend 10 minutes unscrewing and rescrewing the metal panel
Epic School Fail XD
just to get the cable out
it's damn annoying
They should learn to tape io the wall :P
Or just have hooks on the wall XD

Ray; whats up o3o
Roads where not a single car has used it since something like 1972
02nothing new
Abandoned villages where not even ghosts haunt them

02Hey

I'm watching an eagle and falcon webcam live at the same time
12obsessed D:
omg The falcon chicks just fought over food
and whut Isukra
/me higs an eagle and falcon
*hugs
oo
12hee :>
The floof of a falcon chick reminds me of a nice floofy towel
/me turns you into a falcon chick
Someone needs to examine how it feels and make a cotton towel based on the feel of a falcon chick
'...'s floof
Now I'm watching eagles, hawks, and falcons at the same time
02Btw I decided to put up one of my arts on TST
7Cool. :)
02But I don't know how to use HTML so it won't go on my profile

hi ecco
Hey Kosovo and everyone.
4hi
02Hey
02Maybe...
02mmmn
4hay is for horses, not for chatters
02Maybe I'm part Ponyta
02Don't judge me >|
4I'm so mad. I can't get my Eeveelution! Please tell me you have the same problem!
4and sorry then
02Your Eeveelution?
4yesh
02I take a firestone
02I use it on Eevee
4i won an Umbreon but I can't get it
02Boom. Flareon.
02Uhhh, I don't know what you're talking about
02Hey Shiny~ I killed the Lagiacrus
02Nice
4*gasp*
02Now the world can end in peace
02:3c
4Ray is evil
12o-o
02Maybe it's just a bug
02I haven't gotten on to see if I could get my flareon either
4a bug that at least 100 people are getting? sure let's go with that
02Yeah, a bug that everyone is getting
02That needs to be fixed
02What's your explanation?
02They're mean to you?
4but anyways, i hope it gets fixed before the event ends
4if i don't get my Umbreon i will destroy Pokemon
02Can't you get Eevee from DW?
4i don't know
02Obviously you have Wifi, so if the event doesn't work, get some random Pokemon, put it on GTS and ask for an Eevee
4*sigh* but i want Dream Umbreon
7Shiny; actually, the Japanese version can.
02Yeah, I just saw that lol
4hi hi Quany
7Hey, Chao.
/me 4hopes Quany has the same problem
02Btw, I wanna be Dreampals with Quan D:
4hehe lol
4hey, anyone wanna have a wuick trade? I don't wanna put my Rhyhorn on GTS
7o.o
7Chao, sure.
4it would be kinda cool if you could also choose what item the traded pokemon should hold
7As soon as I transparify my sprite.
4*quick (late)
4oooooooooh sprite
4i'm bad at those
7What's "primary Scratch volume" as Photoshop says? O_o
4something with primary nails on max volume?
4:)
/me coughs
02Ohrightpills
7Eh, I have to restart my computer to transparify my sprite.
/me 7doesn't want to. o3o
4do it! do it! DO IT!!!
7Ehh...
02My pills first, need my pills first ;v;
/me 7blinks.
7Uh, so, anyone else want to make my sprite's background transparent for me? :<
02I don't have anything that could do it
4sorry i fail at sprites
7No, Chao, just make the background transparent. :P
7If you have any moderately advanced art program, it's easy.
02I have Sai
02But I don't know how to transparent anything on it
7Hrm.
You should use GIMP or Paint.NET
7Ah, never mind.
7Imageready somehow works even though Photoshop borks.
02I have GIMP
02But I forget how to transparent on that too
4Quany, I fail at backrounds too =>

02I know
02<3
02Cap guru? o-o

03no reply
13Does it at least say "work in progress"?
03wait

03nope
13http://support.pokemon.com/
13Go on Ask A Question and inquire about it o-o

02Well, for school's sake, almost all my teachers bombarded me with homework every day. I was stressed out from something earlier though
10hope ya feel better soon D:
02I had to go to the doctors because I've been having headaches every day for the past couple months, and they said they saw fluid in the back of my eyes.

Hi Kitten! Looking forward to raptuer?
It's today :3

FFFFFFS
13Nope, still waiting for the staff to sort it out :<

rapture*
I have to call my doctor

Rapture's already come and gone
no Earthquakes in Aussieland
/me slobbers all over Espy
Yeah but we all know that god prefers the U.S.
So it'll be amuricah time <3
I find it dumb that this thing got so popular
although I hadn't even heard of it until yesterday
I just got sucked into the hype I guess :/
;o
heh
/me showers before going to Pirates of the carribean
ffffffs he's not in >.<
and have fun o.o
13That's right, you get in that shower you smelly bum :<
/me sits next to Curly
/me hides
/me hugs the slobbered Espy
then he'll be a rusty bum o3o
[14:29] <+Curly> I find it dumb that this thing got so popular <- Agreed.
/me flees
LOL
Blah gotta get food from the store
the world's going to end on June 14, 1991 :O
02Can you get me something? D:
someone make me famous please
/me makes Curly famous
yes, I know that's in the past
lolz
/me gives Shiny some of her popcorn
02<3
I didn't care about it until I heard about all the business opportunitis
02Hey
12Hello Shiny :3
7Small question: I'm making a Fakemon series, and I need to choose between names for the first in the line; does Chikiwi or Chiwik sound better?
Chikiwi
crappy 3G, that's all
7Thank you.
Yeah it's kinda stupid but oh well
/me goes to find out what happens to Chuck Grene and Tyrone King
*Greene
/me bbls
7And thank you as well, Night.
12Your welcome, and bbl :3
7'kay. :)
02Mmn
02I like Chikiwi as well
02Is it a kiwi? XD
7Yes. :P
7Grass/Flying line. :P
/me 7thought out its stats, behavior, moves, yadayada.
7Except for a back sprite.
02<33
02I wish you luck :3
7Lol, thanks. :P
More rapture stuff? Seriously?
:o
Not my fault
heya junh1024-X2
How is it not your fault if you're the one who brought it up, dude? :P
more internet trouble?
That question has no answer due to the negative proof fallacy \o/
13I want a Bird of Paradise Pokemon o3o
/me wins <3
good for you
=/
awww
13Fire/flying type :3
sawie :3
I guess I'm the only one interested xD
/me smells floof
Not in it directly, but in the sociology of it
Sure it's not in the making fun of people of it?
I mean, I don't believe in it either
12Charizard LOL
/me runs
7I was thinking Ho-oh. :P
But I'm getting sick of people prancing around like they're so intellectually superior because they don't believe in some crazy theory
7But my third in the line I'm making may be a peacock. o.o Haven't confirmed that.
12My first thought was Moltres XD
I have yet to meet anyone who did believe it
Me either
It's just people who do believe in it that are spreading it around
*don't believe in it
and the internet makes it sound like half of humanity was believing it
whoops :P
I'm fascinated with the sociological aspects of it
/me rolls on the floor
02I'm so excited to see it Quan
It's only like 20k people, which is a very small number considering the exposure
7You can see my sketches. :P
02<3
7FYI, it's on a page with other miscellaneous ideas and doodles and writing.
Yeah, that part is actually very sad
02Mmk
A lot of people are going to lose everything they have because of this nonsense -- everything that people have built up for themselves all their lives
What about the people who are taking advantage of it like those "business opportunities" you were interested in?
7http://imageshack.us/m/202/3237/dendrootchikiwiandhumiw.png <-- Bottom-ish area.
Taking advantage of people isn't sad?
(assuming you weren't joking, of course)
03those look on par with 5th generation
I haven't seen too many people actually doing that... I've seen a few joke websites
03however, that's not saying much.
/me hides
But I'm talking about how you said you were interested in it
I've seen a couple people posting about that on facebook
It's not a viable business model anyway
7Ah, shush, DRF.
03no u
02Ahah, that's cute
02Y'know drf
02You should try making up a generation of Pokemon then
03Fine, pay me as much as the Nintendo people get paid and we'll see
speaking of rapture
# Multiple news sources reported that Camping's deadline expired without any noticeable events at 6 p.m New Zealand time on 21 May 2011.[53]
# Two minor earthquakes hit the Pacific.[54]
# No sign of devastating earthquakes in New Zealand or elsewhere, as people report in using Twitter.[55]
# Several news organizations reported that the Rapture had not occurred and the prediction appeared to have failed.[56][57]
# Nothing appears to have happened in the UK
:l
02Quan, are you getting paid that much?
No one is seriously interested in this because of that
if you say so
It's like
It's like Rebecca Black
7Lol, no. :P
It's something for everyone to collectively giggle over and move on a few days later
7I did sprite a quarter of a person's fakedex for ~$50.
Meh
I just saw you said this
And I saw your post on Facebook last night
yeah xD
And I couldn't tell if you were actually being serious or not
02Ah yeah that one person
Of course not
7Hmm, nah; more like a third of the fakedex.
I could tell you were having fun with it back then
xD
The Rebecca Black thing did go on for quite a while in this channel
I guess it depends on what happens the next few days
I imagine a huge influx of "Toldja sos" today
02Those were pretty cool too
then it's dead by tomorrow
02Some of them anyways
"herp derp derp I'm so smart because I knew the world wouldn't end"
that's really all I hear when people talk about the rapture
It's a meme now?
Since when?
Maybe not meme
But no, not really
Yep
You're the only one listening
And you already talk about it
I'd say she's simply complaining about everyone taking it seriously is all
Your fulfilling a counter-culture role by rebelling against it
02Anywho, gtg
7Bye, Shiny.
02Seriously, good luck to you Quan, I'm really excited to see it
No, I'm ranting to one person who was annoying me by being smug about it
that's it
I love how when I argue with you you always try to turn the blame on me in some way
it's very amusing
That's a counter culture role
You're participating <3
Sure
Sociology aside
But it's still only to one person
Who already talks about it and spreads it
meaning my ranting is probably not spreading it any more
we responded as such
and that's it
I did and I disagreed
You're just riding your moral high horse and pretending to be above it all
Called it
But neither of us are
<3
dude, no
I'm not "pretending to be above" anything
she's simply stating her opinion
as was I
what the hell gave you that idea?
Am I not allowed to rant about things that annoy me without being on a "high horse"?
I guess I'm counter-ranting
Ugh
forget it
I'm on a counter-counter-culture thing
is it safe.....?
!ew 3G

7But I'll do it here.

02Hmm
7Well, but do you LIKE them is the question. :P
7And if I should add a third to the two.
02Um, yes. I like them. I don't know how to explain it.

02I'm just so confused

ohai

7Hmm...
:D
7Don't fret too much. :P

7All right, then!

PHP is fine
C++ is not
02oooh yay <3
7It's a bit... realistic. O_o
7The bottom half, anyway.
(Then again, I'm not a fan of it either... pure C is the way to go. LOL)
12php can be evil somtimes though
12sometimes*
12In this weird way
C++ is bloody annoying
it can be pretty confusing and the fact that you have to specify pretty much everything x.x
my friend uses C++ for RN
there
I prefer C
C++ has more bugs than even java

/me nods
/me is kinda tired
Well... Sure been a while since I was /here/.
;o
ohai?
Kipi or something?
Mmm, nope. (;
Well, I don't know then XD

12RPforlife
12D:
...no idea
5Maaaaaaaybe~
02RP4L~
5;D
XD
02Long time no see~
12what do i get?
12for guessing it D:
5Haha, yes, long time indeed.
5Um, I dunno, a cookie.
/me 5hands Isukra a cookie~ o3o
/me wants one as well :(
5 /sigh

5SCHOOL KILLS. That's all I can say about my long absence lol.
02x3
5And when I did come back one time the chat scene was in shambles and it scared me so I didn't come back.
12oh..
5And I just don't really feel the motivation to post on the forums that much.. so meh..
02Yay, Welcome to the lazy club
5Well, the thing is I used to be super-active on the RP boards, but even those lost my interest when some of my friends left TST.
ew school
;x
5But that was /years/ ago when they left.. Heh.
5So yeah, I've officially finished high school though. Yay~
congrats
02^^
I'm still in grade 10 ;x
i never forum RP
5Thankee~
5Zoroark, why? o-o
lool
i still have one year
l3
hi
mostly because i haven't been able to be active in any forum besides the GG2 forum for the past 4 years
5Hm.. I'm a member at Phoenix's Asylum but our RPs are reeeeeeeally slow. xD Because we feel the need for LONG ELABORATE REPLIES and we're all super-busy.
and i don't like having to write text walls then wait for replies etc.
i mostly RP in IRC
5One-on-ones tend to move most quickly because you don't have to wait for more than one person to reply. x3
I haven't IRC RPed properly for ages
5Oh gosh, IRC replying, meh, I could never stand it. ^^; Lines aren't long enough and paragraph spacing is wacko.
i don't think i've ever done it "properly"
but i could probably
i can write text walls and stuff
if i wanted to set up an IRC RP server one of the things i would do would be raise the character limit because i'm fairly sure you can do that
if i remember correctly
;o
5Most of my replies average 400-600 words. So not exactly text walls. Depends if I have a bad block or not enough to work with.
IRC derps on lines longer than 255 characters
5...Which is really irritating. xD
pretty much
400-600 words are text walls to me
Causes problems with scripts as well sometimes
especially since the only forum i've been on often is basically IRC anyway
in messageboard form
5Zoroark, really? Haha, I know people who would be like "I DEMAND MOAR WORDS FROM YOU NEH". But past 600 words and you start risking purple prose. =/
but it's not an RP board anyway
it doesn't have one either
it's a video game discussion board
5Yeah, but I mean on a /forum/ it wouldn't be that big of a post, eh?
and that actually describes the only other forum to hold my attention quite well
"Think of this like the zeroconf IPv4 IP addresses (if you've dealt with MicroSoft, you've seen these IPs when Windows gets confused and can't find itself)."
lmao
5The only other forum I frequent other than PA and TST is probably.. The Rush Forum. But it's HUGE. Like 9000 or more members or something, and it's super active. Most people are from the US but there's a big UK crowd there too. Gets kinda nuts over at TRF though. xD
I used to frequent about 10 forums ;x
Now it's only 2 main forums and one other that's kinda deadish
02I used to lurk 9001 forums
IRc is basically the only thing that really keeps my attention
12nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
IRC*
02Play Monster Hunter, Or see more anime... hmm...
o-o
I have not
my life has been a living hell lately
>:
12yayyyyyyyyyyyy?
/me brbs
5Why? D:
now I think I will
because everything will be better from this point on
Hm.
Yo
Evil doer
Haha
English Evil Doer
the worst kind
jk dari
yeah I know, the monocles just add to the evilness
it's horrible
and the bulteriness
Looking up Spyro stuff for reference with my model is bringing up some nostalgia - remembering just how good the games were, and why I loved them. They really don't make games as good as Spyro any more.
*butleriness
No they don't :(
/me neber experienced the true magic of Spyro until a year and a half ago
*never
Or maybe I'm just too old to appreciate games in the same way as when I was 9
see, I was raised without Spyro
therefore I cannot spell
I feel like playing through it now.
/me is back
hi
woah
XD
triple jinx combo!
huh
+50 pts!
...
sorry
My internet will be turning off in a couple minutes :(
:P
D:
Noooooo
:(
Meh, I want a proper new Spyro game.
wb
Definitely getting my own place next year if possible
so what's up
....XD
Spyro, now with added leg!
:P
yay
So I suppose I am making a Spyro game.
When I finally finish this damn model. :o
XD
awesome
I had a good day but I'm stressing out a little bit now
Why's that?
02Thx~
I'm trying to figure out details for this venue that I've never been to and it's a really small place they're like LOL YOU GOTTA EMAIL US TO KNOW WHERE OUR CLUB IS
and I googled it and found the place
=/
email them?
that's odd
but there's absolutely no data of how much the show costs to get into or when the doors open
O_o
and I don't even know if I'll get a response from them because by the looks of it they hardly ever even update their websites
which are only myspace and facebook
That's weird, you'd think that'd be bad for business
Yeah.
and it sucks because it's a really good lineup
yeah well there's lots of venues downtown that are like that that I've never heard of
there's been private hidden venues before but I've never been to them
A wedding, a dead osama, then a rapture, what's next....
plus it's around the same few days as a couple other shows I have to attend to, I have to film for 2 bands a few days before that one and the day before that I'm going to a tribute concert and it's gonna be a long one
someone randomly making out in a PM here
XD
02Pineapples.
and I wouldn't mind attending one a few days after the one with the private venue that I might be able to get in the crowd with somehow filming wise
but I'm allergic to Pineapples!
04Death-bringing plagues.
:x
04...LOL
no seriously
I think at least 3 times
or 2
yeah
lmao
04hahaha
then one of the two shows I was going to go to at the end of the month cancelled; but maybe that's a good thing because I don't wanna overload
;-; i missed it
it was in PM
Damn you sound busy.
it's like all these events end up coming around the same time as eachother
when I was at school.
show me logs
XD
last month I had to go out 3 nights in a row
well fuck
04LOLWUT
04AT SCHOOL
04HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA
will you be able to fit them all or will you have to make a choice?
I wonder if there were people behind you watching
of course
they were IRCexting
02^
XD
and it wouldn't be so frustrating if I was old enough to drive but then my mom has to try to get off early because I'm too far from the city to take a bus
but I'd be fucking screwed
if Hensh decided to get on his admin shit and look at my screen
:X
04XD
04Yes you would be.
yeah.
and things would be a hell of a lot easier if THE VENUES WOULD JUST POST THEIR DAMN INFORMATION uggggggh
Over the PA: "WHOEVER IS DOING THAT SEX RP, STOP IT NOW."
04LOOOOL
Lmao
XD
Yeah, that's pretty retarded
I hate businesses who do not understand this whole internet thing
makes it really hard to be a customer sometimes
yep
it's like, the internet would be great for making people be customers if you just keep them updayed
the band that's playing at this private venue I want to see, they played in january or february earlier this year at another venue I didn't know and it was also hidden so I didn't end up going
the next step is NS doing a strip tease on camera xD in front of the class *runs8
jk jk
I only had...3 shows throughout january and march
/me hides in rapture
its been a rough time but its all over now
wat
04hahahaha
and then april OH YES THE SHOWS CAN'T BE ONE WEEK SEPERATED FROM EACHOTHER OH NO THEY HAVE TO BE ALL IN THE SAME DAYS OF A ROW
04I'd pay to see that.
and then I had one this month
o-o
^
/me SHIT
and ALL this shits happening in june and it's like arrrgh
04SHOT*
04fuck
XD
I have been to hell and back
04That was a bad typo.
Lol.
D:
Drake would shit to see NS strip
DRAKE
is June this busy every summer?
yes he would
and then Drake would pay NS...with his fresh shit.
it also sucks because my mom and I were gonna travel down to california if she was able to make time off to surprise one of our other musician friends at a solo show but we don't even know when he's gonna do those and it might be during the time of the other things
/me shot.
:P
lolwut?
and no, it just happens to be that all the things that I wanna see end up being so close to eachother at a random month
she doesn't accept regular money
I've seen that dari
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130603981354.gif
That one? ^
and i can kinda see drake accidentally saying by accident: oooOOOh, NS is the sex.
nope
04You are terrible at this game
im terrible at everything :x
other than remixing
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7uWBHrhX3M
:B
Oh and DJing
<3
:3
lol
Pinky MGM lion = win
im kinda glad you guys dont tune in, i would kill myself if NS were to tune in to my live show o.o
kidding of corse
course*
I'm hoping I'll be able to manage, I don't know if I'm going to go to the one in the middle of the month, especially since I have a lot of plans already, but it would still be nice to go because the guy from one of the bands randomly sent me an invite
and he's mutual friends with a few of my other friends in the business
...derp?
04lol
I hope you will too
so I thought "is this guy adding me because of the mutual friends, because of my editing or just to add me?"
/me burps on NS :P
thats for burping on me earlier
/me farts
ewwwwwwwwww
XD
03LOL
/me farts on her
/me farts harder
FARTING COMPETITION, GO
dont shit yourself
03ohgodlolz
/me farts harder
I'm not shitting myself
I'm fucking on you!
o_O OMG
03666
No
its a 69
or a 5
03666bitches
ANYWAY
XD
being a midwesterner again will be interesting
I missed the area
its only 666 when Sneas does it
"She'll die" "She will not!" "Give her time..."
I'm trying to still do filming for more local stuff, and starting to make friends with more of the people that I'm not already aqquainted with, because I figure it'll help me more when the time comes to get a more serious job
and i dont even wanna know what it is when NS and Drake go at it
That's good thinking
but will have to adapt to the summer humidity again
I'm super happy that mansions moved up here at the beginning of this year, that was one of my three shows in april, I recorded the whole set and talked a little about the videos I film and the official one I've made and they asked if I'd send the stuff to them later on
03lolwut
Woah, really?
o-o
Another official music video in store maybe?
04It's fun
it can be a soup
I used to live in Missouri and yea it was that bad
and I'm friends with a guy in another band that'll be playing again in june that's played with aiden alot, so I'm going to try and get to know the rest of them better too and do some filming
Indiana has the same climate
yeah I'm hoping so, if I collect enough footage
especially since mansions has no official videos
"Surprise buttsecks" "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"
oh they don't?
nopee
are they really underground then?
yeah
x_x whats horrible is I actually did date someone with a much dirtier mind then NS.
my only friends that know who he is are the ones that I've shown the music to
I have yet to meet someone that knows him before I do
sadly enough
@___@;
that's possible?
/me hides
mhmmm
here's the mansions set if you wanna watch it http://www.youtube.com/user/fr0zencreek#p/c/F83C44656EFA120A/0/zsZK-BLLYmM
oh, wait, it's just one guy?
03aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah.
he's the only official member, in fact I think he's the one that does most of the instruments on his albums
is Sneas getting raped again?
he has his friends help him live though
or did he fail a test?
03other stuff going on lolz.
live as LIVE IN NEW YORK IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT not live like I LIVE IN A HOUSE
because when I reread it it looked funny
:P
haha, I know what you mean
:P
"You tripped over a ba-rock-oh-ba-ma"
Did you know that you can actually make urinals using SNES cartridges XD
and speaking of such I got my new mansions CD in the mail
Drake; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2VBUqAdFHc&feature=related
oooh, nice
well it's new to me at least, it's from 2007 and it's not available for downloading anywhere not even on iTunes
I finally got mine downloaded and listened to it
and it came with some sort of disc for one of his other albums too; but it's not a CD and I'm PRETTY sure it isn't a vinyl; it's too small to be either of those
it is pretty good
yayy
did your jarrod gorbel's ever download or did you get links for those
04NOW LEAVE ME ALONE

"The previous system shutdown at 4:09:03 AM on 5/22/2011 was unexpected."
Yeah, thanks windows, that's really useful
I just referenced a Pokemon episode in a quit message
NEXT TIME: A NEW BEGINNING
i dunno what i'm listening to specifically
but i like it
NS
that shutdown
apparently wasn't expected
im so good at this
inorite
Can't windows ever give error messages that are actually useful? Instead of bawwwwing and BSoDing
There's a lot of LsaSrv warnings
could it be like
overheating
i don't see how exactly
but i wouldn't know the conditions the server system's in
the blue screen of death messages actually are useful
you just need to know how to interpret them
argh this song again
okay windows, you're useless
why do you play this song so much
go to hell
i like the song to some extent
I think Linux is more useless on a desktop or workstation than Windows
but it's like Stairway to Heaven; overplayed
its only big uses are as a server or embedded OS
(p.s. it's I still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For)
long title
12o-o
oh man.
life is a highway.
Linux is useful for servers
for everyday use I suppose windows could be better as you have the programs you need to use
windows is retarded though, so
not really
Windows can do quite a bit
like viruses
:33c
12darnit why do i keep listening to this song
its more friendly with hardware than Linux plus a *GASP* STANDARDIZED INTERFACE!

way to take it out of context
and bend it to your own bias
i'm joking
the fact is ALL COMPUTERS SUCK

whether they run Windows, Linux, Mac OS, or anything
they all crash

just sayin'
12yes true
I have jeopardized the stability of Linux and BSD systems before
lmao
its not hard
12but it's all about preferences which one you like
12nice try
Windows in my case
xD
well both winblows and *nix have their ups and downs
12one thing i should mention
12if you are a gamer
I can't live in a non Windows world
12you'd be dumb to pick another OS
I tried
but I just can't
12besides windows
linux is absolutely useless for games :X
yes
12so is mac in a way
because if you pick Linux you are screwed
same with Mac OS to an extent
12some people take an effort to make a game apple friendly as well
12but they will always make a game windows friendly
12i like to use linux when i'm away from home
12and really the only nice thing i see about macs is that they are great for editing media
I can't use Linux exclusively
because Linux and TV tuner/video capture cards don't mix
especially Express Card and PCMCIA
once i get a new desktop i'll probably convert my laptop to linux
Video 4 Linux has been stalled for years
and its pretty much a dead project
12triple boot mac linux and windows
12there you go
lmao
12that's how the pros do it
12many are
12it's not rare
12having both windows and linux is like bread and butter
what
12butter by itself is nasty, bread by itself is "okay" but still a little bland
12put them together and you have something that truely tastes awesome
umm!
12or are you confused now
i'm not sure your analogy is the best wan.
12think of a better one then lol

popcorn the way i make it, which is to say, stovetop
12best way to do it
12besides campfire
12darnit what are those called again
microwave popcorn?
12jiffy pops?
i don't even have jiffypop
i just have the kernels and some vegetable oil
12i se
i love it
12well
12microwaving isn't exactly high quality cooking
12just something quick
12and simple

a good reason why you should deny people posting comments on all internet web pages nowadays if you're trying to advertise yourself

or we're all having the same hallucination

Has nothing to do with me being in the military either
or once he finds out WE'RE ALL bronies :P
12Lol, that’s because a-png’s are animated png file, whitch are much higher quality then gif
12files*
Aaand?
HTML 5 and SVGs have even higher quality and support
:P
but anyways Yes I am alive
even though the world ended yesterday

(Not to mention Javascript and all the other animators for images/files) :P
I still think you's be a hallucination
yes huh
that hurts my feelings
I can't fly
hmm
hallucinations could fly
I didn't think hallucinations had feelings
maybe I was wrong after all...
they can still flye
"fly"
12Well, a-png's are much easier to make without corrupting
fyre flye?
oh, nevermind
evil doer

Haha.

anyone who should be here?
You search Spyro 2 on google images and porn comes up. Nice one google.
Dari and me
ah
Dari and I
for you grammar nazis
12The FireFox editor is better though, just for the fact that they invented a-png’s
Who is the Fuhrer of grammar Nazis?
Nu uh
or she use to be
:P
*?
true
he does it for himself but doesn't correct those who don't
12And yay for Opera, they can play a-png files too ;P
I will blame you for causing me to go back through a pokemon phase
Yay!
Pokemon!
I should bring back my GrammarPolice script

It would never have to kick anyone here though
:P
12I would not get a web browser for that alone though
Oh what have I done
all your fault
Fail.
not funny
watch what dari taught me
LOL
it is to me
oops
12Like you said, no one uses a-png files
not a very wise person to pick
well, when you leave it up to fate...
wisdom's got nothin' to do with it
did he teach you the ban trick as well?
12I just like to make them from time to time for myself XD
nope
or gline
those are fun
I'm familiar
Yeah, that would be pretty unwise
but here's another fun one
random gline script
And his head went right through the urinal.
that was five characters from my keyboard right there
Exactly ;p
/ g r e e t
AEIOU
*6
Plus it takes up more space and who knows what else to use
What is the AEIOU thing?
vowels?
So many undeeded features (*firefoxcough*) make it a liitle bit slow
:P
you doing Hooked on Phonics or something?
It's from a video someone posted on SF.
In a multiplayer game where when you type something it uses text to speech to read it.
I actually went out and bought a 3DS
wha-seriosuly?
I have no life
I would if there were more games
besides working
or lower price tag
or, you know, both
well I do need it for when KH: 3D comes out
I'm buying a car
:D
So no 3DS for me
cars are overrated
you can have one of mine
12But watch out for IE8 (no web pages with round corners D: )
and the two things I mentioned, right?
You have more than one?
I have two
why?
my personal car and my company car
I bet it's his baby.
ah
nah
lol the coke truck
do it!
I can't give her the truck
it's locked in the garage
and take a whole bunch of glass bottles of coke with it
I have my actually coke car right now
the truck is for special occassions
How would I get it anyway
I'd drive it to you of course
But then how would you get home? XD
...a dn how would you get back?
fly?
Ah well, you could stay here
YOU ARE A HALLUCINATION
I could
Minnesota's not so bad
What about IE9?
I have to go to Green Bay anyways
except for the winter
I live in NH lol
Does that have OMGOMGSPARKLYCORNERS ;o
it's not much different then Minn :P
except you're closer to the ocean and such
I never go there
boo
(Again, round cornered pages have as much appeal to me as Twilight's vampires ;D)
fine I'll send the truck to Dari
I'm sure he could find good use for it
how would you get over the ocean?
Hahaha.
and back?
it's a coke truck
it can do anything
it flies
duh
nah
ooh
I was just gonna say that
even cooler
gotta snorkler and everything
I'd spray paint "PEPSI ROOLZ COKE SUGZ" on the side. (:
my car can go into space
lol
Just in case the fish want some Coke
he woudl to
I've been to Mars a time or two
just visiting some old war buddies
There is a dishwasher on mars
I've been listening to Ricky Gervais too much
dari will be proud
Lol, I put feet on Spyro and it looks as though he has little shoes.
image?
pics or didn't happen
Sure, give a me second.
you all suck
you suck too, man, thanks
XD
(I remembered this time)
The APNG format was rejected by the official PNG steering committee and as thus has no change to be approved as a supported W3 standard - http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_name=3.0.6.32.20070420132821.012dd8e8%40mail.comcast.ne
Random, but if the PNG guys don't like it
Then it's a trashy format :o
Tiny shoes.
haha, nice
now just give him gloves
/list
Epic chat needs more traffic.
BRB
/me drives on through this channel
how's that?
I mean the network in general. :P
:P
yeah it does, but the larger IRC networks take up all the users
You need to buy several e-cars and drive them all over the place.
Could just find sites that don't have an IRC channel and send them an email about whether they'd like to set one up or not.
I've tried that in the past
hard to find such website, but I'm sure you have more connections :P
Aww, crap
/me calls up his repairman
/me throws out tacks
This hurts so bad but tastes so good
12Random floof
dari KNOWS PEOPLE
And people kill people.
<3
Understand?
Finally back on windows
Capisce?
XD
Emmi!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
and no other networks want to merge because they all think that their networks are the "next big thing"
:D
Proto!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
:D
