"Im going to destroooooooy you when I get up there ;)" -Maximus to his wife
UH-OH! DO I HEAR SOMEBODY BUILDING DIAPER CHANGING STATION? :O
He learned from the end of BlackOps 2
ok im confused, half the internet says thumbs up was death, the other half says it was death. which was it?
NOTHING.
Ashles: /) XD :D
twilight_sprinkle: Either way they die
*other half says it was life]
twilight_sprinkle: Neither! It was a sideway!
anyone else think this senator looks like "getoffitgetoffitgetoffit"
Barbie
A potion?
twilight_sprinkle: lol I dunno
stop talking in riddles, old man
yay, my phoenix wright wig is getting well done
A super potion?
Joaquin sure does know how to make Roman emperors look like complete pusses...
twilight_sprinkle: i think down was death
Soulless_DCLXVI hey you still here
twilight_sprinkle, AFAIK, thvmb out is death. Thvmb in is life
twilight_sprinkle: It was Rome. Everybody died every day of the week all the time, thumbs died too, everything died, even the stadiums died and the air died and rocks died. Everything died. XD
Time to fight.
Kandarihv: which way is out?
flvttercry: You have convinced me that Caligula is awesome. Declare war on that scumbag ocean and then make your pony a senator, true badass
Kurra: Hell, I did.
Kurra: that's a lot of death! :O
those hedgehogs just wont hold still
Rome = ded
lol fat and bored
no internet
Kurra: Rome is pretty ded.
Trollestia you did what?
fat and booooorrrinng
From what I understand, death was respected.. thumbs up for a good fight, meant kill. Thumbs down meant boring, keep going.
nyeh
There's not much to this movie apart from fighting, is there? :P
Ashles: Tis' a lot of honorable death :P

CriticKitten: Shizuka would agree with you....and she did as I typed this
13do you have the problem too where the modem insists on switching to a channel that has interference and kills the whole pipe?
stupid kid
LOL
CriticKitten: CRITIQUE THIS KITTEN PLEASE
Oh, it's on now son
Sorry I missed the movie, i'm more forwards to Mars Attacks! though... ^^||

CriticKitten: Tell me about it. I used to work for them.
Dammit kid
Shizu: The receptionist actually had the brass fucking balls to try to sell me more service as I was sitting on the line trying to get her to fix my existing service.
VenHur: there's still a little bit left :D

A great and glorious future!
13i mean at least me i know there's interference on 10MHz on the line, every single time i'm down it's because the modem switched to it
Wait till he hears all about Nero.
SaxyPretender: eeyup, that guy
CriticKitten: You need to feel this scarf. It makes everyone happier. *holds out scarf* Its so soft :3

I still, can't believe you're leaving me, in the middle of what used to be OUR THING o/~

ikr
he didnt fail, commodus cheated
He looks high
look them up
twilight_sprinkle: Only if the noose is at the side of the neck, if its at the back they get suficated
I would not want a reputation for mercy if I was a roman emperor
thats what my history teacher told me
Now I know where Kirsten Stewart got her acting lessons >_><_<
Commodus the douchesplosion
any leader, really
He's wearing make-up
He's crazy like all Roman Emperors.
Some Roman Emperors.
I AM GLADIATOR IRONMAN
i wouldnt want to be a leader in any way
What a dick
fuck that shit
whiner guy... :[ gosh, I could watch Teletubbies and feel manlier
He will die
Douchesplosion... New favorite word right there
like, it's useful to be merciful sometimes
What are you going to do?
never
twilight_sprinkle, crvcifixion, afaik, causes death by asfixiation.
Douchemodus
frequently, even
NO.
hm ok Spazturtle
but it's bad to have that reputation
YOURE GOING TO LOVE ME
IRON ROMAN
LOVE ME, LOVE ME, LOVE MEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
IROMAN
NO MEANS NO.
Incest blood more like it
YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE ME :U
cause then your people will walk all over you
no
:[LOVE ME
merciless dick is best rep
Youre going to L- awwww
yay
Dang kitty keeps bvgging me!
Keep the royal blood pure....
Is the son dead?
no kiss
just, fair, uncompromising dick
Denied!!!1
stick that finger right inside her mouth
Fuck no, you're not merciful, ya dick
I don't think so.
sure bro
hes nuts
Some make a "Gladiators in 5 secs" with that scene :D
Bite his finger.
:[
No
id judge everything with a coin toss
I DON'T THINK SO TIM
AM I NOT MERCIFUL!!!
you're like, the mercifullest
no
SHE'S YOUR SISTER!
:[
you forget to brush
Kandarihv: idunno, my middle school teacher told me they snapped necks
...No
NOO!!!!!!!!!!!1111111111
yea whatever alright
Not really, rapist
...nope, you be insane
You are a merciful... excuse for dick.
:[
No, you're a whiny spoiled brat. Get a job!
Spit on him!
um... 8/10 would fuck
MAXIMUS
"You are going to love me!" again. Except it was much manlier when said by Fluttershy
TELL ME IM PRETTY >:(
I AM YOUR FATHEEEEEEEEEEEEER
you're... going to LOVE ME :[
so that's where Cenk got that line from....
MAXIMUS
maximus!
I would smash his dick
All I here is wah wah wah, daddy didn't love me
YOU'RE GOING TO LOOOOOOVE ME
Wow! Yov are a dick!
RadicalEdward2: LOL

MAX-I-MUS!!
MAXIMO
MEXICO
MAXIMUS!
We need Tyrion in here
MEXCIO
:O
MEXICO
I would be confused because I am a dude
MAXIMVS
Trollestia: I see wat u did their
MEXICO
MEXICO!
IshExtremelySadPony: good for you
MEXICO
Tyrion....
She should have just snuck in dagger and killed him in his sleep
twilight_sprinkle, well, maybe that's the case. Hanging is different from crvcifixion.
what the hell happened
*there
I can't even get halfway through ADWD
dari: Agreed
MEXICO
it's so dull
MEXICO!
GRAND UPPER
MEXICO
DSNesmith something, something happened
he was my fav character up through ASOS
yeah keep walkin, bitch.
then suddenly even he can't save that book
marc antony zinger
Mexico lets ago!
Ironic since I DO lives in Mexico...
MIANI!
Tyrion knows how to deal with the emperor's type
although AFFC was so bad I barely finished it
MEXICO
I can just see Crymodus being all like AM I NOT PRETTY?! to his sister
Kandarihv: wait crucifixion? i was talking about hanging
Sad prisoners :(
interesting that he said that while destroying families, raping women and burning villages
high as a kite
0,14gotta say, Commodous has nice armor here
MAXIMUS
MAXIDOUCHE
Mexico
twilight_sprinkle, Vm, yeah. Sorry. My bad.
Commodus used Taunt
look at the diva in his filly white barbie suit
MEXICO
So... whats the moral here?
am i lagging?
...Wha?
Doucheodus
yup
twilight_sprinkle: They do snaps necks, but not all the time
Commodouche
Gladiator who saved the day.
Um...
Is there any historical accuracy to this film?
/me puts his moral thinking cap on.
kudos to emperor here
Good evening everyone.
.........MEXICO
IshExtremelySadPony: yup
Stahp tat.
VenHur: :D
yes
I like villains with the balls to do their own dirty work
....yes.
oooooh burn
burned
commeth to thy bro!!!
Commodus's armor looks cool. Reminds me of the Light Suit from Metroid Prime 2
emperor McWhineFace needs to work in retail, and start growing some chin hair. XD
AdamTheDuck: Good evening!
hi AdamTheDuck
YOU WILL BE. YOU. WILL. BE.
did the ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED already happen?
haha
DSNesmith: so you like discord, not chrysallis
:D
twilight_sprinkle, yep
twilight_sprinkle, indeed
awww :(
eeyup
well I also like ham
yea, chrysallis is not a likeable villain
Death Smiles
so chrysalis gets saved by that
The great and invicible maximus
Well, Crvcifixion was an especially crvel method of execvtion that the Roman Empire was known to employ. Hanging was never that notoriovs.
second arena
Only the stupid do not fear
twilight_sprinkle: about an hour ago :X
Bronysith what percentage of this film is historically accurate?
oh snap
Burn.
if not longer >_>
MEXICO
Q is best mlp villain
Ashles: i went to eat dinner around that time :(
how can Death smile? he's cloak and bones!
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHH BVRNED HIM
the gweat and poweful maximus
OUCH!!
Nooooooooooo!!!!!!!!
Cheap Shot!!!
Oohshiny: enough!
[firstworldproblems]
oh come on
BAD TOUCH BAD TOUCH
HAAAAAAAAAAAAX

I think I love this villain.

HAX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
/me SMILE FOR ME NOW BROTHER :[
*Kiss*
Worst brother.........ever

A
Cunt

*funny
BITCHD
NOW Commodus pulls a Melvin on us?
EPIC ENTRANCE!!!!!

13http://i.imgur.com/JZK6m.jpg any thaumcrafters around? i'm pretty sure that's bad being right behind my house
BITCH*
dem rose petals
I love this bit
the dagger was poisoned btw
So much
/me screams millions of swear words into his scarf
That *squee* is a spy! D:<
Et Tu Mr Mumbles :(
IshExtremelySadPony: pretty good actually, this shit did happen...they left out the fact that the barbarians came and destroyed rome years later after this film
emporor fights like a bitch
Wow...
hey, who here watched Gargoyles
petulant, whiny, doesnt know what he wants, and a backstabber. REEL FUCKIN VILLAIN RIGHT HURR
yay.
DAT SYMBOLISM
fuckt hat
CAN I GET A FLUTER YAY!
sad squee :C
I did!
yay
dat scene is beautiful
He looks really good in that pure white armor.
Shizuka: isn't that just one of the elemental fairy things?
SPARTANS!!!!!
Emperor owns an Emporium
:(
the emperor is a coward!
it's a giraffe
Why do I always start to lose connection at the battle scenes
SHIELDS.
Dat symbolism
Screw discord, this man is a real scumbag
only the pilot, cow
Geonosis?
BOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!
hmm
Kid is still alive.
But of course, it was so long ago, I hardly remember it.
pretty boys back :)
Shizuka, Don't know, you might want to defend your house just in case
Lucius is a fuck.
you gotta love the idealization of a culture of exploitation and brutality
time for dat singing
I LOVE YOU HANDSOME BOY
Midnight_Fyre because the pony gods hate you
this guy is a bigger douche than discord
was one of my favorite shows... which is why I torrented it and watched it again
hey any modes know if they're going to play the credits music
Sand to the eyes
dirt hands
:3
this movie has the best credits music
HIS ARMOR LOOKS SO COOL
Than again, I can't remember much.
mods
not modes
Throw sand in the eyes
I CAN'T GET OVER IT
13it's peaceful mode so the mobs that drain flux from the environment won't spawn
discord is not a douche he is a genius
That douche would wear all white
Im going to make a list of words to describe him
FIGHT TO THE DEATH!
MuffinsPrime: I KNOW RIGHT
pocket sand!~
This fight is why I LOVE this movie
BOSS FIGHT!
the build-up
the anticipation
And I get a commercial RIGHT NOW
13which leaves lightning strikes and bad effects :/
Oh shit!
according to wiki, the emperor was actually a pretty good fighter
What have I done to offend the pony gods? :(
Wow, the whiny douche can fight.
You can do eet!! Kick his pussy ass!!
so why's he look like a fop here
CrystalPhoenix: me too!
GO MAXIMUS!
Shizuka: D:
white armor = whimp
boo yah
Midnight_Fyre nothing, they just hate you
Takedown!
THE FUN HAS BEEN DOUBLED
GO Maximus!
YES.
:'(
light suit
black armor= awesome
look at that, stabbed in the back and is still kicking his ass
oh he's lagging.
13i think i need to get singleplayer commands in here, see if spamming the "make lightning there" command counts
...and the whiny little bitch is actually somewhat decent. Who'd have thought?
Boss conditions: You have less health, you own less armor. The boss have more armor and attack speed
WOWCH.
So let's review
thier amors resemble light vs dark
YEAHHH
i still think squalo would pawn both of them
Midnight_Fyre good, gooooood, let the hate flow through you
of course he can fight hes a roman noble
LIKE A BAUS
MrBen: Magnificient Bastard?
DSNesmith: because if he was a fighter, then he could actually defeat the protagonist
Of course, he's still getting his ass kicked.
MURICA
Oh snap!
slice!
:[
no
go black armor guy!!!!
THAT BLADE WAS POISONED.
best way to kill your opponent=with their own weapons

Fight to the death/10
The Enigma's review of GLADIATOR: MAN, I WAS SO ENTERTAINED BY THIS MASTERPIECE! The opening scene is spellbinding, showing the true gore of battle, the fight scenes are marvellously realistic, discarding the popular "pretty" sword fighting for brutal aggressive force. The audience in the arena express every emotion, surprise, anger, and enjoyment. The cast is brilliantly chosen; we can really see Russell Crowe as a gladiator, in
I should go to the movies more.
but when he wasn't acting he had some reviews I found interesting
nostaliga critic is pretty good
I promise not to say murica..
And then we have the stunning special effects, we can really visualise the greatness that is Rome, the fight scenes really make you believe. Some critics have condemned the lack of historical fact, for instance an emperor would never fight a gladiator, and these comments cannot be denied, its true.
or whoever long b movie is
but little kuriboh and AVGN is better
Right. Well, I'm cutting out. Dinner calls me.
I WAS ENTERTAINED/10
AVGN bores me
swearing is not funny by itself
But I think we can forgive them that one fault for such an amazing movie. Without hesitation I give this movie a truly deserved 10/10!
Later, everyone!
Still a better love story than Love Movie...wait...that movie doesn't exist.
...WOO HOO!
HA
Deadpool/10
/me eats a brownie
LT_SKINNY: Not until after a pony ep first
LT_SKINNY: best B movie is Alien

Ponies? Ewww :|
Alien isnt a B movie i fight you for that
00,10Skip ponies go for B movie ^_^
twilight_sprinkle: what does that mean?

Ashles: YESSSSSSSSSS
Ashles: yes

Sumica: I agree

Dark92Enigma: too long;didnt read
Ashles: Yes

Algent: I say this one is mother cause there were too many A actors trying to hard :P
I WANT PONIES
Eyeup, I think they showed Troll 2. But I wasn't there to see it :(
I came for the Movies, but stay for the pony!
I want ponies

No ponis
Euer since 20 minvtes into the first hovr, I'ue faithfvlly been replacing u's with v's and v's with u's. It's been tovgh, bvt I think I did a good job of it./10
Mars Attacks was a funny movie
00,10Quorl get adblock+

Oliver Reed
Stopwatch: It was made as one, doesn't mean it was bad :D
I like actual reviews without a schtick that do relatively in-depth analysis
Dark92Enigma: srsly tho, when theres 320 people in chat, you need to make compact comments if you expect people to read them
such a great movie
/me splits Bronysith 's bed in two with a karate chop
Buytoast, he's meh imho, havent seen much of him though
Kandarihv: I haven't been paying attention.
I came for Gladiator, but I'll stay for Mars.
Sci-Fi Debris is probably my favorite reviewer
What you guys talking about? I don't get ads at all.
This was my first Bronystate Friday Movie, and had a great time with the chat. I'm gonna go now, will be back for the new episode. :D
SKIP PONIES SKIP PONIES
he does invective so well
^
bye Slenderpy
I agree, which is what his really early reviews were like
Dark92Enigma: cause chat is moving too fast
Slenderpy: good night <3
so lets watch gladiators on mars
see ya Slenderpy
I'm out of that mode now.
Trollestia: NO
anyone thinks Alien is a B movie has not seen I Nuovi Barbari
I came for Mars attacks but I stayed for gladiator
Bronystate should just put on the leaked episode.
Buytoast, more informative than the average critic though
I'm ad free, and I don't even use adblock
Slenderpy: that's an EPIC name~
Oancitizen for me.
Bronysith, how many have you taken to bed tonight?
If we skip the ponies.. it will be chaos!!
Dark_OOkami: you mean John Carter? :D
actually talks about the movie and stuff like that
ANARCHY!!
Algent: YES, this'll take FOREVER with ponies.
skip
Bjornfot: just you and Phase4
Ducing Mars myself. HATEthat movie. Makes NO sense.
Thanx, bye
all the crossover e-celebrity shit was what killed nostalgia critic
so what is mars attack about anyways?
Thriller_Whale, it'll air when it airs.
Bronysith: dont forget AttackWithHugs
Thriller_Whale: Haha, had to watch it to avoid getting spoiled :(
it's a tim burton flick
MUST HAVE PONIES
Bronysith: With that I mean like, this BMN.
they got inflated egos from all their cons
maybe if he was actually funny i'd be able to tolerate him
Cirno: I think it's about Mars Attacking Earth
I just thought of one: Commodouche
or something >_>
also Kandarihu you wont like chat during B movie, it will most likely be nothing but MURRIKA MURRIKA MURRIKA FUQ YEAH
My favorite part of a movie- the credits said nobody at all XD
does that answer your question Cirno?
:D
gah
Kencolt dude that movie was never supposed to make sense
additional music
by klaus baudlet
still funnier than Raywilliamjohnson
you win this time
How the hell did the hub manage to leak than anyway
that movie gave me nightmeres when it first came out
that*
second time wathed Gladiator, still entertained
Algent: was probably apple
i really like when movies end on something more meaningful than some random action scene
i always watch credits acually
Cloverfield has better credits music
/me yells G A K in the room
watched*
Bronysith: I remember when I thought he was funny... then I turned 12
The planet Mars, becomes sentient, and attacks earth in all out boxing match for the Universe.
00,10Apple cant tell time
terra: what movie was that?
<< this ending was good
Crino: It's called Mars Attacks. It's abut babies going out and smokeing
twilight_sprinkle, I know. But it's either this or George the Hedgehog. So it's a Lose/Lose situation this time.
but when your humor involves showing a freeze frame of a SO RANDUM laughing moment 7+ times...
/me slaps Juice
Guh
maybe you should just give up
/me "needs more dry paint"
twilight_sprinkle: oh. ok quick recap: fantastic action scenes, envolving drama, an unlikable but threatening villain, stunning effects, great acting, and an hypnotic, brilliant ending.....all in all 10/10
/me hugs Algent
When has apple ever told time?
did they release the episode 8's name?
i will end you Scoot-Scootaloo
mars attacks
Algent: YES, this'll take FOREVER with ponies.
What about gàk?
you turned 12 while nostalgia critic was running?

Fun fact: The new ep was leaked
Pony sex is not real. It is simply a sick fantasy

Heart's warming with a mod? Yeah that's rigged
B-movie needs a reroll, Sumica. BNI is an A-movie.
Moist towelettes?
Well at least Heart's Warming Eve won
0,5Kandriah-............. AttackWithHugs wins!
Gotta love it when the mods BALLGAG you :D
takes me back to the days when intermission was a picture of derpy with popcorn
Shizuka: Hacks!
I love moist towlettes, makes me moist
lol
00,02XD
BNI is definitely a HUGE A movie.
:D
Kandarihu won on my screen
Yeah Shizuka I was hoping Hearth's would win
im so exited that i finaly got picked
I watched it too. Now I'll be able to give a proper rating after the episode airs
/me is always jelly and has no need for moist towlettes though
BaconMane what's my prize, sir?
Sumica, reroll the B-movie.
I won on my screen too.
I won on my screen
AYE! Reroll the B-movie!
00,02Kandarihu, you always win on your own screen
/me gets into a C-130 and flies it into the ocean
It's TOO good.

0,5Hehe
0,5No, Kandriahu actually won
Leaving shortly
Why reroll the B Movie?

I never got picked, the mods never loved me, and by the might of God, I WILL get my own pick one of these day and becomes the soon to be mod that I will becomed! Even if it takes...FOREVEEEEER!!!
otakon17 x home
Kandarihu: Because it's Really, REALLY good. I've seen it before. It's GOOD.
OohShiny, actually
VenHur: ikr
Kandarihu: Because the current B movie choice is actually A-movie material.
So, who won?
00,02Trollestia, he got kicked just before you said that
VenHur: SOON.
the episode next week should be.....
Okay
Shizuka: out of all lotteries, how many you've won so far?
THE MYSTERIOUS EPISODE 8
/me wallows in self-loathing because of losing
13two
SirGanjalf, A Movie: The Running Man. B Movie: batteries not included
13all pony episodes
00,10Probably
IM NOT WORTHY
Derpy_Hooves: Running Man....what Kandarihu said
thanks Kandarihu
0,5From now on whoever answers first gets the kiick :3
00,02i've won 1 B movie iirc
I really REALLY want to watch the Emporer's New Groove on here sometimes.
Shizuka: including this one......what was the other episode?
Sumica, everyone is demanding a reroll on B-movie. I don't think I need to say much else.
I'm not worthy either, Kipkat07_Scarf
00,02it was Titan A.E
13griffon i think
yay
00,02good times :)
00,10everyone?

Shizuka: the one that just got by :D
Sumica: EVERYOOOOOONE
I say, someone needs to suggest the Emporer's New Groove.
Don't reroll. Just award B movie to me, so I'll shut up about it.
so... if the new episode was already uploaded...
Ta_Dikin I like that more than I should.
00,10indeed Trollestia
Where's fluttercry when you need him to help debate the movie's A/B status?
Inb4 Somepony...or even me....picked the MLP move for an A Movie.
13here give me B movie and give credit for hearth's warming to someone else that voted it :P
/me gets into a C-130 and flies it into a mountain screaming "I AM NOT WORTHY!!!"
;)
00,10I would totaly rig that one to win >_>
*movie
Phase4 Wat? I thought for sure it was after.
Sumica: You agree with me?!? I've never been able to figure out how to suggest it tho :(
Wait, so we won't do Mars Attacks?
00,10there was like 30 of them Shizuka
Bronystate is becoming a big blur for me now!
NOOOOO!!
I voted for a different ep.....so no credit for me, please :D
Barbetos: Made it
2001: A Space Odyssey is best movie
Barbetos: i'm used to it
I must ask something, does DCD ever enters the chat?
God damn, my internet sucks
Kipkat07_Scarf: true story
00,10Trollestia between tuesday and thursday there is a link on the home page here to sign up for lotto/newsletter
Barbetos: it'll calm down, trust me
lel i voted for winter wrap up instead of hearths warming eve
wish I had some cider~
Or maybe I shouldn't be downloading Doctor Who
Strongbow or Henry Weston's... <3
Sumica: Alright, it seems like I tried several times last week and nothing happened, but hey, I'll give it ANOTHER shot this time around.
cider :<
Sumica, I take it you aren't gonna reroll even if everypony tied you down and forced you to?
It's a bit early here for Cider
hate cider tbh
.....this picture http://25.media.tumblr.com/7eeffe667b72b6cb878ec089d4b49df4/tumblr_mf1yjbZbVB1r8z5dfo1_1280.png

DON'T REROLL! i wanna see Batteries not Included!
i dunno
/me was not worthy of bronystate
Back~
:)
IRON GIANT
Bjornfot, do naughty things for my amusement!
Dark92Enigma: It's an A-movie, it doesn't belong in the B-slot.
Dark92Enigma: Yeah, but it's A movie material, not B.
your face is causing it... really, you scary mon.
iron giant was one of the best movies
no no no dont undo my first win please
HOGARTH
I have a whim to play a FPS game, recommendations?
It has started raining outside.

Okay guys before Mars Attacks starts, let's get all the spam out of the way. DAK DAK DAK DAK DAK DAK
Will somepony tell me Im not worthy? I need the reassurance
TOOT
Discord invented the universe BAM!
I get the dark feeling that Sumica is not going to reroll, thus forever marking Batteries Not Included as a Bronystate B-movie when it deserves MUCH better.
Did i miss the lotto??
Kipkat07_Scarf, you're not worthy
Whatatweest!
Or is it tomorrow?
FUN :O
I remember when there was a guy named Jim here...
Kipkat07_Scarf: YOU ARE NOT WORTHY

kinda ironic how the martians theme has the same pitch/notes as the music the kills them
IshExtremelySadPony: atleast chat didnt went crazy saying that stupid mem
meme*
The Enigma's review of MARS ATTACKS! WHAT AN EPIC movie. Tim Burton did an incredibly good job, as usual. One of the things that seems to bother me the most is that some people may not understand the purpose and the message of the film: it's mission is to spoof all those action and Sci-fi movies that abound on clichés and laughable scenes; in which Independence Day fails.
Yes guys do you watch tv or go outside???!
OohShiny: In Connecticut this morning.
does this movie have a post-credits stinger or can I go now?
pony_3999: ikr
I like how Las Vegas had first aid XD
remember, a lot of our pony friends would be considered "hippies" as well
not sure, cant remember
pony_4908: that sounds bad...
Magna913 We do
BYE!
Connecticut school got shot up by two gunman
NYC_Brony: Lets see...Trixie has magic and Derpy has muffins.......
LT_SKINNY: it was by one
0,14also, I'm adding this to my small list of "Tim Burton movies I think are good"
remember, a lot of our pony friends would be considered "hippies" as well
:|
Anyway, much more shouldn't be said, since Mars Attacks! is one of those films that you have to see for yourself, and ultimately evaluate. 10/10
OohShiny: Indeed it was. And the worst part is, the 20 children that died were KINDERGARTNERS.
Hey lets give a quick moment of silence in the chat for those 20 children and 7 teachers who were murdered today in Connecticut.
00,10and you are brining that up why LT_SKINNY?
Big Fish was a better Burton movie.
Derpyshy: Magic Muffins?
I still rate it ACK/ACK
pony_4908: why did the guy do that, anyway?
eh, imo last weeks B as quite a bit better though
You guys suck ass.
Sumica: Because everyone else was?
Sumica: what are we going to watch after brony movie night?
Seriously.
and someone brought that tnews up
no
news*
Like do you not care?
Magna913 WE DO CARE
we already discussed that earlier
drop it
OohShiny: I'd imagine just why any of these things happens. Just a crazed lunatic with a gun.
are those 2 gunmans got arrested? Or are they still on foot or even dead?
texasboykc09: ponies from the dvd with commentary i think
texasboykc09: Sumi said MLP FiM commentaries from the S1 DVD
there's a difference between a pony hippy and a stereotypical hippy
NYC_Brony: Probably XD ask zecora to make magic muffins
Sumica: did you hear a buzzing?
SirWrathy: Nah, I think they got arrested.
Magna913: really?

Magna913: this is #bronystate. Calling for chat silence in the middle of a stream just /isn't/ gonna happen. No way, nuh uh
Kandarihu: I agree as well but seeing as we have an immense anmount of people chatting at this time I'd suggest doing this at a later time. It was a serious incident that I believe shouldn't have happened.
pony_4908 true that
We do not know everything yet and just want to just...watch ponies

Sumica: the night will last forever
That's my problem with Bronies PERIOD
I said it twice :3
Sumica: show daylight's end if needed
So many Bronies are such mewling...well..hate to say it..pansies

Why are Bronies so obsessed with TF2?
It's fun
Its like all of the vids are ponies and valve games
LT_SKINNY: Kinda... He's kind of crazy, but he means well.

cuz its an awesome game from our youth
Ashles: Wed love for you to stay :)
pony_9690: Not all bronies are obsessed with TF2.
True
pony_9690, because there are pony models for GMod
LT_SKINNY: i'd love to as well <3

I haven't played it.
Who ISN'T obbssed with TF2?

Who ISN'T obbssed with TF2?
I actually started playing this game and became a brony last year Dec 11
OohShiny: I can definitely see it :P
Azuredragon, I'm not really obsessed with it, per se.
AJIsAwesome: same here, i dont planned on

Who WASN'T obsessed with TF2? ftfy
dont be sad medic
My apologies.
PLay Mst3k!

TWO BEST SISTERS
Personally, I think the reason TF2 is still going strong after like, 7 years now, is just that it's the ideal online multiplayer shooter. :D

hey Kinixys :)
Hi Kinixys :)
LT_SKINNY, thelonepony.
hai kinixys
hi kinixys
Yep, he even SAVED AN ENTIRE KINGDOM.
where's Tara anyway?
yep he did
his voice is so much higher in the first episode
oops
yea the whole voices were a bit off
still doesnt seem like they really plan out the magic
same here
"How to Make Magic" - Gandalf
i remember watching this wayyyy back when
Ashles: In the DVD commentary for Season 1, Cathy Weseluck said it was because he was originally supposed to be a literal 'Baby Dragon', but they eventually made him more of an adolescent.
Well Guys Imma Head Out. Ill see u all tommorow /)
wow...never noticed the magic thing!
listen to the "oot" they make
it sounded like they doubted this would be a big hit
twilight_sprinkle: I hope they expand on that in the future.
yup <3
Canadians and their "oot"
I see. So the voices were done before the animation.
The way children pick up vocabulary, I had the thought that Spike should have heard Twi use those words before.
Magna913: nigth <3
aboo

What is his name?
This guy here
THE ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE
DocSane: lol i wouldnt be suprised if we ALL burst into song tomorrow :D
laughing on demand seems like the hardest thing in VA'ing to me

twilight_sprinkle: I sensed foreshadowing in that scene, anyon else?
No, sunlight is not light blue.
Azuredragon: purty
jacencaedus: hm i didnt
the bridle would have looked like bondage gear
Gosh, that seems suggestive
wtf, no sound on my stream?
jacencaedus: i felt some other foreshadowings during those eps tho
DocSane: snow IN sunlight appears to be light blue
Is there somepony skilled in the PMV department?
These poor commentators are running low on things to talk about
NYC_Brony: just you man, check your stuff and refresh
AdamTheDuck: sup man

Java: you dont :P

Gakgakgak you firewally little sneak

Different guy
I was testing
00,10easy we tell Gakgakgak to pick a new name
Changing to other things

Flutterssertive: Just type a name, hitting TAB will auto complete a name
twilight_sprinkle: well that makes things simpler

Oh
Cheerilee Dates!
Peternew was trying to call for the Seaponies when he was in the Hearts and Hooves day, but he fell in the pit..
v
Well that makes putting the acronym in his name pointless then.
I love it when we watch Friday night movies we always yay'd at the most inappropriate moment.
would pinging the other mods make other noises?
i wonder why cherilee is a "mane" character? get it? "mane" character?
3 way
No, only the moderator who is streaming
Lame, dude.

hey where does the pixel perfect pony podcast do its thing?
it's weird whenever I type, and enter, the crolling freezes
SpirittHooves: Celestia Radio
00,10SpirittHooves they do it on Clestial Radio
hi im lol
right after the new episode right?
00,10not sure when they do it
teru teru bozu!
COWBELL!
00,02SpirittHooves, pixel perfect pony != pre/post show
MORE COWBELL!!!!!!!!!!!1
I GOTTA HAVE MORE COWBELL
kk cool thx
00,10can you untune it
ok anybody know why the chat isn't automattically scrolling?
antitune
Undotune is best autotune
00,10jacencaedus, make sure you scroll all the way down
jacencaedus: Your chat is probably frozen.
lol
SpirittHooves: Check their Twitter feed for showtimes: https://twitter.com/PixelPonyShow
00,10if it keeps doing it refresh it
^
00,02jacencaedus, its a bug, just refresh the chat
jacencaedus: heh youre one of the few people whos figured out the manual scroll in a frozen chat
thx J_E
And of course, he would see it...if it's frozen...
00,02twilight_sprinkle, really?
00,02first thing i tried first time i got the bug was to scroll
alright, thanks everyone
Scrolling always breaks the chat for me
Phase4: dunno, doesnt sem like people know about it, because everyone refreshes chat and misses conversations
00,02well the scrolling breaks
trolololololol
00,02besides its no fun having to manually scrol
00,10nice that they talk about snips and snales
Welp, I think I need to get a haircut.
00,02refreshing holds the bug off for another few hours
Phase4: it isnt fun true, but it helps not to miss convos
alright, back
It's why I switched to iris
Ah Ponydex...
tab doesnt work during manual scrolling either
00,10them nudges at bronys again with out saying brony
And then when iris didn't agree with firefox, I got mIRC
And then that was not free, so I got Nettalk
omg..
I just murdered somebody.

Doctor: shes busy trolling people on twitter
Apparently, brony655321, Princess == good, Queen == evil
oh
what am I doing there
Luna has transformative magic... Celestia and Luna Are CHANGELINGS and Chrysalis is their Mom! :O
jkjk
LOLOL
lol
Colt_Silver: Ah.
Uncanny valley mice!
00,10wonder if they will comment on the eye
And there goes opal.
Cy
nooo courier D:
fucking opal
hise
But that's the thing. People were expecting a Princess to be more powerful than a Queen.
Okay, out of horses what to do... oh right.
Sumica: from when is this?
please buy flying courier
love this
00,02horses
Fameous glitch!
00,02CYCLOPONY
CYCLOPS
brony655321: Its belived by the stupid Higher ups that little girls think all queens are old and evil. Lauren Faust actually wanted Celestia to be a Queen but they said no
THE GLITCH
yesh buy it
Colt_Silver; Maybe she's being Trollight Sprackle??
Azuredragon: thank you Disney
the cyclops pony still lives
dem supports not buying flying courier
doctor mayhaps..Shes very wibbly at times
But that makes me wonder, how old is Chrysalis?
dem noob buys gem at 5 minutes of game
Pinkie shy?
babs seed is the cooliest pony ever
without an invis on other team
lol cooliest
spit.
XD
\:)
brony655321: who knows
Pinkamena is cute
Hey, I love the straight hair too!
It's just Pinkie
00,02XD
pinkamena time
straight hair is 2nd best hair
hah equestrian engineering https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fcbSX2JSFbA/UMuKvpTdY3I/AAAAAAAAPNw/uw8-MUY9tmY/s1600/MaintenanceBloom.png
STALLIONS GODDAMNIT
That also makes me wonder why people were surprised Chrysalis beat Celestia.
Yeah, straight mane Pinkie is cute.
<-- Matriarch
:D
dat buffering
lol
epic waifus
matriarch?...u mean those fat zombie things in dragon age?
ooohhhh
To me, it actually made sense.
reveal...from previous episode
:D
Matriarchy, means female run society.
we singing now
At the MAgneto!

AT THE GALAAAAAAAAAA
Soulless_DCLXVI: im ok with this.
Matriarchy > Patriarch
WELCOME TO DIE!!!

richfiles: what?
gay bitches
LAWL
:D
At the Gala, with Magneto!
00,10you want us to animate this in how much time
O.o
At the Magneto... It was an epic spur of the moment thing that happened during a livestream
Big Mac Vs. Blueblood!
00,02XD XD
00,10free is best price
An Xmen ad featuring Magneto kept popping up during this episode.
Damn straight
so basicly Big Mac Vs. the loser?
ah
The streamers started singing at the magneto
well of course.
as a joke
id pay a bit to see that
sssshhh
XD
It was the big Mareathon before the season 2 opener, if I recall correctly
00,10at one point the magneto ad crashed the stream
00,02richfiles, i'ma let you finish, but magnets are the best thing ever!
00,10cause they clicked on it
LOL !
Derpy!
I was there! :)
DERPY
00,02derpy!
Yay
"easyright"
D
:D
derps
Has anyone else noticed the excessive Berry Punch rather than Derpy in the new season?
season 3 needs more orchestral/rock/choir/soloist songs
00,10the computeres they had to render dureing s1 were not up to the task
brony655321: Lyra/BonBon is the new derpy...
ive only noticed the lack of derpy \
dota in a nutshell
Confound these pnies, they drive me to drink... Berry Punch's brew! :)
00,10s2 they upgraded everything
Celestia is happy to see Twilight
00,02i blame adobe
no she isnt
But there's been a surprising amount of Berry being Waldo this season.
I miss Derpy :P
yeah, I once lipsynced a rob swanson animation to winter wrap up, it is more of a pain in the a** than people realize
00,02their software is inexplicably slow
00,02horribly broken slow
She was a second ago, those wings were up.
00,10it very bloat
Phase4: I agree
Prince Blueballs
00,02its bloat to the point that one wonders if its not intentional
:D I slept in my chair the entire night...somehow headphones fell to the floor at some point
FLUTTERSHY GOES CRAZY
:[
I get the feeling that Derpy may appear in the new episode. Just... don't spoil it for me.
What did I miss? :P
dispenser
DAW :(
and I didn't even make the lips, I just had to do the syncing part
I get that feeling too...

In the USA
Happy birthday isn't public domain?!
Usa....
USA :[
00,02i'ma say this right now as my offical position on the matter: F@%K Interlectual property
no
Why do you do such bad things
;_;
Happy Birthday is copyrighted. That's why most restaurants do that "from all of us to you" version.
00,02absolutely broken laws that do not line up with the reality at all
Phase4: THIS
twilightpls: That's why some TV shows don't use it when a character has a birthday
prince blue balls
so is season 2 out on dvd?
if you ever watch a sitcom, you may notice happy birth is rarely used
ya seriously copyright laws are WAY to extreme
I mean, it'd be fine if it was like 20 years or something, but the lengths it is now.
00,10not yet
Huh
EVILSHY INCOMING
SpirittHooves: Not Copyrights, IPs
Copyright is fair
00,02Darzoz, doesnt work like that :(
IP is not
Dat laugh!
MINE!
Sunny Bono did horrible things to copyright law till we were rescued by a well placed tree
00,02copyright isnt fair, theres no set expiery
see, evil
Phase4: There was at first
its canon.
00,02companys can sit on a property and do nothing
00,10yeah
brony655321 well in spanish is violonchelo and its over 2:OOAM for me not paying attention to my spelling/grammar also if you expect someone to know you are correcting them a ping helps
Phase4: In the original Copyright institution
I wasn't saying it worked like anything. I just think it should work some toher ways, bleh.
00,02but anyway, pony
00,10and then other companys have to crack down on people they did not want to
00,02back to pony
Phase4: Seen Everything is a remix?
GAH ADS
I don't make sense, I've been awake too long.]
00,02Vordox, nope

Goldframe: Daniel Ingram
inb4 K-ON
good point
fan made anime style... yes, why not
hi
dude "there is an anime of it. No Exeptions" should just be an internet rule at this point
Having watched Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex, this isn't so far out
and damn it...I was going to say Kei-on
i wonder why italia made that opening?
So anime has anime of it?
Luuunaaaa
I mean as far as foreign languages are concerned
meh, its a good song, but it doesnt fit as well as the original imo, sounds like some latino drama
Applebloom

HINY

DERPY!

I grew up with the book, and the movie just blew me away

Jealous of the deep voice
Is this song actually from the movie?
i'll have to read the books someday
I would love to see the hobbit, sadly I may have to see the next Twilight movie first.

I chat on tablet... I can take all of you to the bathroom with me if I need to! :D BWAHAHA!!!
i dont think so
the song is from the book, yes
wow sound like some satanic ritual
Koyaanisqatsi is too damn deep for my voice -_-
I used to watch the animated Hobbit movie every single night when i was a kid
Darzoz: you poor soul

05it sounds like epicness
Can't wait to watch the movie
dafuq GetPainFree ads

Whoa, this is not satanic. It reminds me of the gregorian chant

It's like if Wall-E were a turret.

Apparently "Fallout: Equestria" is gonna be a radio play like the Doctor Whooves Series.

I like the color Blue better than red. Red is liek one of my least favorite colors.... Why then do I always root for Red team in TF2???
WAHHHOOOOOO
