I wonder if those pics were inspired by Mommy Nearest.
lq is alrighyt
babababababa
Druid Fluttershy, Wizard Twilight, Rogue Dash, Bard Pinkie, Paladin Applejack, and I'm not sure what Rarity's supposed to be, maybe a monk?
9the quality of the HQ stream should look like a TV Broadcast.
9oh wait
9we watched this episode already
Isn't that the ep
And 9 is MLP/Soul Eater
yes it is
9how are both feeds?
9is any of them lagging?
i must dash, back laters..
I dunno how I could say if the HQ stream is like a tv show or not.
9later, streams
9derp I mean stripes
9Dermathil, does HQ look good?
I'd say I see a few pixellelation at times
yes it is FreezeFrame
9but isn't it much better?
*pixelisations or whatever
hehe,
So, anyone have any idea what class Rarity is in #6?
The other 5 are really easy.
9guys, how's quality and fluidity?

She needs to be more gentle.
Like a bitchslap to the face. Of Rika.
So she understands.
9GENTLY PLEASE~
eeyup
OH SNAP
WHAHAHA
Why so dark?
hey, after this can we watch ponies?
mentally advanced ponies?
9after we finish with the whole series, sure
9I want to test something, anyways
just quick pony break, like a mentally advanced episode, then back to 'splosions
9in the meantime, choose two episodes you'd like to see
How many episodes to the series, as a whole?
9 26 total
9this is 21
ah
i thought we couldnt watch real ponies during the week
9we should be done in an hour and then some
oh, wait, so when did we watch episodes 1-20?
Dragoran
NewDCD: in about 1:30 hours actually.
9well, I'll do it because I need to do a test on quality
or something.
We've still got 5 episodes left.
pah-pah
Nvm about the dark.
azumanga daioh next!
9how's the quality?
that glasses girl is such a bitch
good dcd
still in her head.
spoilers
Actually, if each episode is 30 minutes, and we have 4 and some fraction episodes, we still have more than 2 hours
/me does a SPIKENOOO
azumanga daioh next!
/me does a VADERNOOOOO
9I don't have Azumanga
drat
9also Barry: each episode is 22 minutes long
it's pure gold
9so 3 eps = around one hour
BAA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA
bababababababababababababababa
rarara
9also
9we watched episodes 1-20 between today and yesterday
9yesterday we watched 1-13
after doing some math, it turns out that after this episode, we will have 1 hour and 30 minutes left
9and earlier today we watched 14-20
you were right, Derm
9Ziltoid
wow, I'm not on nearly long enough to see all that :P
9how's the quality on the other stream?
i have inuyasha seasons 1-4 and all of fma on dvd
I think fast, Barry.
@calc 22 * 5
6 22 * 5 = 110
Also, the episodes are as long as MLP episodes.
Now how to convert that into hour:minute format
That's 1:50
barry: 1:50 minutes
Just figured out how
@calc 110/60
6 110/60 = 1.833333
hours
meh
1 hour 50 minutes
true
9well it's slightly shorter because we're skipping the Ending
yes
ponies in mechs
@calc 21 * 4
6 21 * 4 = 84
I figure the ending is about a minute long
my stream keeps blinking
9Reticent: watch the LQ one http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=BronyStateLowQuality
9YIIIIIIIIIIES
Tne office workers are intelligent.
GREAT
9STAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPU

9>PK
9>leaving the fandom
9I know the guy personally
9he wouldn't do that xD
NewDCD: I don't
Maybe
That's the thumbnail
I have one RL brony friend who writes fanfic, but I keep forgetting to ask what his pen name is.
god damn, Antipodes, hold still so that i cna get around to you!
/me will never write huge fanfics because he has Attention Defi- butterfly!
same as FF.
I'll write single-chapter stuff
Tried to start one, can't get myself to write anything past chapter 1
So what's happening over here?

Oh. XD
I had a very epic Soul Edge fanfic that died at the halfway point for that reason.
I just heard someone insinuate I'm not going to finish it and leave the fandom
and I decided
Hence why I normally avoid incomplete.
that I should tell this fool off.
first we get Prison, now PK? who's next, Butterscotch Sundae? EsperDerek? Lauren Faust?
9which one FreezeFrame? Inb4 the SiegXCass one I'm thinking about
Faust?
I'd die.
XD
hehehe
SAME
It was ages ago, I don't even remember
so so tempted to go grab Butterscotch and bring her in here.
JUST TO MESS WITH YOU GUYS.

10ReticentSmolder tbh I need moar clopfic from you. I'm lacking.
i love her and her work that much
U mad?
BA BABABABABABABA
Gravekeeper needs to hurry up and release another chapter of tBoTS. :(
BABABABABABABABABBABABAABBABABA
get in SilverShipper and I'll keep ya posted
Dashite, i need him to finish so i can print it to read at work! i was so happy when Of Mares and Magic update-completed for me to read at work
he does
Show me your face when then RBD. :P
and then i was very very very sad
because i read it
Yeah, another person I know was loving it up until the lat chapter.
I should shower soon and head to bed. Another long day at work expected.
9well Nittany, thi sis the FINAL EPISODO
Dashite, i loved chapter 11
9you should finish it first : 3c
and i do mean LOVED it
it was a perfect ending
I
I might take a peak at that one now
I'm going to finish it.
RainBroDash: Y U NO respond? :<
if anything, the epilogue, while giving it a happy ending, just stole the most powerful aspect of the story
internet derped
9Silvermane: which sutorii
Not a huge fan of Twixie, but I can handle pairings other than Rarijack
DAMMIT> KEYBOARD FUCK_UP
Can't say about it myself as I haven't read it, but he seemed pretty pissed about the ending.
NewDCD, of mares and magic
9oh
http://chzpokememes.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/pokmon-diglett-used-destroy-the-neighborhood.jpg
Dashite, it's probably because it's 100 pages of romantic build up, and then twist-ending
but then the epilogue happened
FreezeFrame, no Swayback Mountain?
IIRC it wasn't so much that it was a twist ending, but the specific twist that was used.
But yeah.
Don't think he cared for the epilogue either.
Game eh?
I do remember him saying that chapter 11 torpedo'd it in his personal ranking from around 3rd favourite right out of his top 10.
hmm, the 'twist' ending, was one that i said from chapter 4, had to happen to make this a truly epic story
and he did it perfectly
Didn't it piss off a lot of the people in the comments?
but a lot of people probably can't appreciate it unless they have lived through a similar sacrifice, or at least know the emotion
yes it did Dashite. from what i saw when i was printing it
9HO

Weird.
They seem alive. XD
So how come they stopped for 12 years or so?
Japan now considers monsters as natural disasters.

Grew under all of tokyo
Gonna make the city collapse one day
and killing it will make it collapse sooner
Oh.
9not really Dermathil
9they said it was descending 10 meters per year
that is so cute
yeah
one day it'll reach the molten core
9so in a few hundred years it would descend to the earth's core and incinerate itself
and it'll die
9so basically it's better to leave it alone
I know
and the city is gonna collapse then
I'm probably 1mil of those 3.5mil views

9Well
9that was a great series
The Sheep Song!
EEYUP
>10 meters a year
Really liked this show
>couple 100 years reach the core
DAT MATHS
Think of the thing's size dari.
What size would it need to be for the maths to be correct already?
http://www.halolz.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/halolz-dot-com-angrybirds-angrynerds.jpg
It's still only getting 10 meters closer to the core each year. :P
yeah
But how close would it need to be for that to be correct?
9it was huge so it'd probably melt someday anyways
goodnight everyone
nighty night
9WELL SEEMS CHIAKI AND AOYAMA HOOKED UP

When that thing penetrates the crust, won't it cause volcanoes to form?

TOO MUCH AWESOME IN BIG ASS ROBOTS
Q_Q
don't make me ship you into next week
9yeah
nighty night
9there's definitely a problem with making a poni playlist
yeah
9it must be fixed manually, unlike VLC in which I could leave it in auto-pilot
Niiiight
I think I'll roll over and die now
9 but yeah
9I should probably find a way to force these files into 50% zoom
9well...I can fix it with Alt+1
9I take the quality is HD tier?
I wonder how fast you got your group together, because I have plans for a group.
?
9Nitanny: watchoo mean?
Caesar?
CAESAR KNOWS!
PEPSIGETTING TIME
9also I paused there by accident
I want to get the bronies in Penn State together. Create the (first ever?) university brony group.
9let me test something else now
9you want recommendations as to how to do that?
9also I do think there was a college in which there was a FiM group
I thought I wasn't first.
What show is that newdcd?
9seems Gundam X is the same size as Dai-Guard...seems these shows keep that size
9how does it look?
>mfw those are the factions fighting in SRW J
9SRW has no Gundam X though
yeah
!pokemon
Kosoveon, you are a 5Vanilluxe.
inb4 someone tries to eat me
BIG BUZZ=
owait fixed
9sorry
9I made a mistake
9dat callback to the end of the First Gundam series
9also this opening is still THEBESTTHEBESTTHEBEST
9We're watching this show on Saturday
9so I don't want to spoil it
9was just a quality test
Why do I think this intro has got nothing on either TTGL or Dai-Guard?
9I take it looked great?
It looks good for a 1996 anime I guess
9I meant the stream's quality I mean
I know
That's what I meant too
but I ain't got no reference for 1996 animes
Oh.
Didn't you stream a couple episodes of this ages ago?
!pokemon
o3o
!pokemon'
/me wishes she could fly =/
!pokemon
9yeah
9I did
dat fanfic writer.
Why hullo
9I was testing for compression artifacts
BLACK HOLE SUE AND SELF INSERT
9I've determined it's much better to adjust the stream to the size of the window
!pokemon
Yukari, you are a 14Tyranitar.
OK
Ew Red Bull
:<
9also, Streamception
9you can now see into forever
eeeyup
9DEEPER YA ZE
9OKAY
MOAR DRILLS
never said I was a fan of it, I was going for the obvious joke :P
9that determines that
!pokemon
Kosoveon, you are a 9Drifblim.
Lul, the built in record for GunZ has horrible quality.
And no sound.
9adjusting the video window
9seems to do the trick
But it still looks awesome when I watch kills in sloooooooooooooooooooooooooow mooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Oh well. My group may be dead then :<
9testing coolguy
/me doesn't want Wiings though
/me wants wings :<
9Dari
Yeah?
9I believe I've developed a perfect video stream theory
!pokemon
:o?
:D now I can levatate
9the optimal way to stream, that is
9Dari
9do you have Media Player Classic?
Nope.
Still, where's the best place to call college people? I don't think Ponychan is.
9go get it
9it's necessary
This is Kamen Riders right?
9I'm going to give you the details via Skype before writing the guide
9yeah, but it's only a quality test
Ah
9Rodman, we've also inaugurated a low-quality stream
Oh really now?
9see for yourself http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=BronyStateLowQuality
>mfw Kamen Rider looks like a Gokaiger
9they're sister series
9it's only natural
AH
Although, any particular reason for the low-quality stream?
9both made by Shotaro Ishinomori
Okay, clothes are in dryer, except kilt which is hanging to dry, dryer duct is attached. Now to put shit on chargers and call it a night.
9Rodman: we've recieved several reports from people complaining the stream lags for them
03!pokemon
03LOL no I'm not
>mfw too much detail FreezeFrame.
9the low-quality stream is for these people
Oh ok, I get it
9additionally we boosted the quality in the main channel
hey, it suits you Danny :>
03not really
03!pokemon
who is he talking to?
!pokemon
Yukari, you are a 12Azumarill.
03LOL WTF
no
US
US
WAT
well fuck the 4th wall
03Yukari, do I know you? XD
hehehe
ohok, it's just a kid
WE ARE THE KID
9enough testing for myself
03!pokemon
03I like dogs
03that one works
um
OH
Dermathil: how is mentioning a kilt TMI?
9Dari, you up to testing perfect stream theory and dual feed?
never changed my name back
03oh
had to ghost
03LOL
03I was going to say
03whois said mibbit
Sure.
I'm Scottish by heritage.
03so that narrows you down to about half of TST
FreezeFrame: no, the "Every clothes in dryer"
lol
There was no "every"
You added that, because you have a sick mind.
well I must've misunderstood then
03ordinarily I'd recognize charter.com as your ISP
03but you're on SBC Global right now
03which can be anywhere in the country
03I like how a lot of ISPs basically tell you what part of the country said person is in
Better put my PSP on charger
and should probably redownload FF IX
03LOL @ this guy that LL and I are playing in left 4 dead
03their nickname is Ninja of Hatred
I've got Media Player Classic installed now DCD.
9Sprinkles
9I'm gonna tell you on Skype
9DERP I mean Dari
9was thinking of Sprinkles
Lawl
XD
9for some reason
I can only fit one game on my memory stick right now. FF VII, VIII, IX, or Castlevania: SotN?
...
NOT A FAIR QUESTION
you just listed 3 of my favorite PS1 titles
7, 9, and SOTN
I would just throw SotN on it and be done with it, but my PS3 is broken.
(my PS3 normally holds my PSOne Classics)
Or if I had a larger memory stick >.>
well, if you do SOTN, it's relatively short, so you can beat it fast and then go for the other 2
12this dumb throat
03oh
03so that filling I got
12oh my nick is still this
03is perfect
SilverMane: I still have my save files on here. So I'm nearly done with SotN
03I can eat hot, cold, sweet, anything
03and no pain
03:)
12i can't have cold
12D:

03since we still have entire BOXES left over from my sitser's graduation party
03*sister's
03well

03like the stuff you buy in large amounts for a low price
12same
12if i have ice cream
03but individually wrapped ice cream sandwiches etc, those are awesome
12i usually smash it with a spoon until it's almost liquidly
03heh
03I usually just eat peanut Buster Parfaits at Dairy Quen
03*Queen
12lol
12blizzards~

Well through the reverse castle
Not quite 200%, but close
I want to say 180+

14and then she says
03dude
03I want
yaaaay
03give me a link
/me runs
14drf

Well of course, you have to consider the possibility that we all have some canadian heritage in us :p
and drf's just a h0rny male
dem cocky boys
14so the she says "omg it's a spam from an app."
14so then I was like "what spam"

03May
14so I check my facebook
03is your sister one of your FB friends?
/me runs

14and there's no spam
14no lol
03Darn it
14besides, you can't find her
am I the only one who's heard of Anonymous planning on hitting facebook?
14she's not related to me
14XD
/me pukes over facebook
Aurora, that's expected
14yeah
yeah I know
14what's Anonymous
wat
either that was sarcasm or you're just trying to hit me up and I sincerely hope it's the former
14no I'm being serious
14what is that
ew drf, watch where you pull your pants down!
she was gone a lot during the time anonymous got attention
Ah
well
Anonymous is technically a hacktivists group
14and no, I don't live under a rock, I just live in a barn
who basically ddos and kill anything they don't like lol
14oh fun, and they're-- okay
14I was going to say trolls
they're pretty much /b/tards on 4chan
yes they are trolls
14looks like that fits the bills
...some of them at least
6although
6I must say
6as much as I hate anonymous
6I approve of their attack on westboro
Altair's probably part of anon
03LOL
03I generally agree with most of those DDOS attacks
14LOL
03though not Anonymous
03but lulzsec
03those guys were amazing
Lulzsec XD
6ok well
lol lulzsec
6I don't know
14well, if they just get rid of stuff that's not needed
At least they weren't too evil, oh wait
:o
14like facebook
6I think it's funny they did it, and that it wasn't anything serious and didnt last long
6but I still don't approve
there's no such thing as evil :p
14i'm sure people will be a million times more social
14I'm just saying
well
in any case, if anon attacks fb I /might/ join in lol
because fb needs to gdiaf
6the only thngs I'll approve of are attacks such as the one on westboro
>|
03and put lots of pictures on
03:)
6they DESERVE all the crap they get
6and then some
drf, I'd only do one to kill fb xD
03well
westboro?
03Sony deserves all the attacks they gbot :P
03*go0t
03*GOT
6especially since I've been picketed by westboro and watched it in person
6it was hilarious
lol sony
14do they have videos on youtube?
microsoft needs to be murdered and thrown into a pit so they never come back alive
6may, videos of what
14neither have I, so
apple as well
14of the hack?
and bethesda lol
Really LOL
03Microsoft is least evil of the 3 major gaming companies
14yes
Because they have Kinect? :P
03no
6lol
14oh
I know
03because they actually stand behind their products
I'm not talking about gaming though :p
03and don't try to brick you if you hack
03*cough*3DS*cough*&
lol 3DS
But at least MS doesn't kill you
Yeah
3DS is fiine
:P
03no
9we're testing PST with him
If you're me that is
/me flees
MS tries to make you a prostitute though
03Nintendo can basically brick your 3DS if htey don't like what you're doing with it
it's that bad
03I mean
well, their prostitute
03I'm not saying Microsoft is sent from heaven
03but it's just like politics
14now way
14*no
03stand behind the least bad
I'm sure people would be more willing if it was "holy"
03and Microsoft is the least evil of the gaming companies
12for nao'
12:P
then they'd claim they had had "it" with "god"
ah
so that's why it takes so long
perhaps
03LL, what are you getting at?
lol
03Sony is not getting any less Evil
03and I doubt Nintendo is
03so...
I still don't like MS though
12yum
Liking Colt of Ponyality
12so
03well
03I
12hamsandwich
OPEN SOURCE PLZ
03don't LOVE Microsoft, but I prefer them over Sony and Nintendo
12with cheese, mayo, and lettuce
12MS might get more so :P
Aginast windows
03so what console am I going to stand behind?
03:P
:Pp
14wait, is no one going to explain westboro?
HML, so are you
03that and Windows is awesome
12read what I said
So you can't really say anything
6may
Good!
:P
or you're a hypocrite
6you dont know westboro either?
and therefore
14no
03LL I did, but Microsoft would have to burn a few unborn babies at the stake to be nearly as evil as Sony
Aren't we all
:p
your statement is invalid
6ok
6THAT
6is a story
6worth telling
14okay
14I'll sit and listen then
6it's so cringingly maddening, but hilarious at the same time
6basically
12O.O
12Danny
and well, microsoft's products are bloody overpriced
May I listen too :o
12that
12was just
they are a hate group that uses religion to justify their protests against gays and such
12._.
@may
and require MONEY
6they're the most extreme religion in the country, as far as I'm concerned
14waitwait
:o
14like westboro baptist church?
14it that what you mean?
lol Aurora, I think hillsong is worse
yes
6they banish family members from the family if they even think about not being a part of the religion
Awesome story Rora o.o
14ew
Poor Anime con
14cult much?
:<
lol hillsong was like "YOU CAN'T LISTEN TO ROCK MUSIC BECAUSE IT'S EVIL"
6and the parents didn't even think twice about it when they banished their daughter
6as well
that's hillsong
>|
same, FF
12yah
03I mean
12but images
12x.x
03what Sony did with the rootkits is pretty f***ing unforgivable
03it's one of the 3 unforgivable curses of the tech world
/me runs
12lolz
lol
03and the fact that Nintendo can basically remotely break your 3DS if they don't like what you're doing with it
12yes
03that's incredibly sketchy to me
12the f word IS an unforgivable curse
just open it
6http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=6774.0
/me hides
and etc.
03and they aren't going to stop doing that unless they get sued
6read the link for westboro topic
03no
LOL
03they use the Internet
There is none
It's all software bsed
03you can prevent them from spying by disabling wireless
03but then you can't download stuff
FIRMWARE OF DOOM
03so it's a catch 22 LOL
03^
Yeah
12Danny
redo the firmware lol
12open the eshop
There is no way :P
12the message arrived
03I'd love to see a custom firmware for 3DS
Not yet that is
03:O
03I'll do that when I get upstairs then
Which one LL :O
12the GAMES arent there yet
03and HML
Aww
12thats Sept 1
I got that one too
12but
03They haven't even made custom firmware for the DSi yet
03heck
03even the standard DS, there's only so much homebrew can do :/
12make sure to oepn the eshop b4 tomorrow
Not even for the DSWii?
Yeah :|
Limited hardware
03so as much as I'd love a complete firmware rewrite for 3DS that gets rid of the evil crap
03It prolly won't happen
03now
12Hyper
03speaking of that
12the message for the 20 free games
03you know what really pisses me off about some elitist hacking groups?
12:3
Yeah LL?
Oh
03basically
I got that a couple of days ago
12and the 10 for GBA
03do you know what a common key is?
Put personal data out?
12AREN'T going to be released ;3
03no
Not exactly o.o
hahaha
03basically HML
03Let's put it this way
12outside of us
12:3
12also
12night all
03You buy a DS game
03LL D:
D:
seeya
Nini LL
12what?
:(
03didn't get to say bye properly LOL
Bai LL :<
03did you hear me say bye on XBL?
12I need to wake up earlyish o-x
12no o.o
03:(
LOL
12but check your PM?
Fail much ;<
03I basically said night, I love you, and I'll text you after my exam tomorrow
03:/
12kay~
Aww
03wish my luck btw
Cute
Of course, I <3 Living Color
03maybe send me a few pix
/me sleeps on Danny
03to look at
03before it
But the synching on Colt of Ponyality is incredibly well-done, and very clever.
/me runs
12good luck :3
03nah JK
03I have some :P
Good luck with that test :P
03anyway
03HML
03let's put it this way
03you buy a DS game
What were you sayin?
03pop it in your DS
Oh
03now
03originally
03there was nothing fancy
03so you could just make a flash card use the same size socket and you're all set
03well, starting with the DSi
03Nintendo put a stop to that
03basically, there's a common key
03that all games have
03but it's encrypted
03and I mean it's like insanely powerful encryption
03something like 10^32 combinations are possible
Supercomputer plz? .x.
03that basically, all DS games that exist have this key stored in them
03so Nintendo goes
03Does the game you inserted possess the proper key?
03Flash cards won't, so they won't work.
03Now, they came out with NEW flash cards for DSi and 3DS that basically just copy an existing game, hence why the AceKard showed up as Danny Phantom, etc
03but that's still an incredibly temporary solution
03so
Aha, I wondered what they did
03that's what a common key is. It's basically a super long password that's common among all DS games
03Wii has a common key too
03as does 3DS and just about any console in existance
Or at least why some cards have games on them
03well, any console that uses digital.
03now
03here's the thing
dari? How long 'til the doctor arrives?
:o
03with 10^32 combinations
I'll try it now.
9he's fixing stuff related to the PST
03even with a supercomputer
03but
9yosh!
03imagine if everyone in the world tried all at once
9I'll check both streams in fullscreen
9and give you my opinion
03sounds good in theory, right?
Yeah O.o
9we have visual, Frisky Dingo
03well
I get the feeling this is going to lag though. XD
Evil processing power there
03such a software exists
9naw
03or it did, a couple years ago
03well
VISUAL ON JACK HARKNESS!!!!
9if you got 1 Mbps of Upload speed
03I ran it for a few months
9it shouldn't
03as did lots of other people
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
03never found the key
9but wait
03nobody did
9Dari
03SUPPOSEDLY
9why do I still see border?
?
9I still see border here
03but then all of the sudden, the program just disappeared, all the download links were removed, etc, all threads relating to it were locked
03and we were told nobody found the key so they're just giving up
I dunno.
How odd O.o
9in the video, I mean
03now does that sound like true hackers to you?
9also there seems to be some skipping
Not really
03hence my rant against evil hacking communitqies
03my friend bluesun has this theory
03someone DID find the key, they just didn't know it
03the group that made the software took the key
9try selecting it as I told you before
03profit
03and then just told nobody
I did?
9just click the window when you're selecting with VHScrCap
03as if htey said they found the key, nintendo would place a large banhammer over them
That's what I did.
All 3 are really good
03so, evil hacking communities :/
03basi
I guess so :<
03basically, if someone were to figure out the common key
Colt of Ponyality wins for most awesome song, though.
03they could do anything the ywanted, literally, on a DSi/3DS/whatever
yeah ff
03write custom firmware
9huh
9wait
Awesome o.o
9then it's not a border
03make flash cards that worked right the first time
03etc
9it's probably a player issue
03because
03Nintendo cannot physically change the common key
03it's existed as long sa the DS has
Then Nintendo couldn't change it :p
Haha
9try switching to another renderer
03so if yous tarted making flash cards using that key
The player has no black border?
03there'd really be no way to ever stop it
03:)
Evil hacking :P
03but alas, supposedly nobody knows the key still.
Yet it's so simple, but impossible
03Or else we'd have actual proper 3DS flash cards now too
03yeah
9we see a bit of a border on the left and bottom
9except it's not really a border
03so now I mine bitcoins instead
/me runs
9but rather a sort of "tear"...hard to explain
INB4 Somebody hacks Nintendo and find the keys
03XD
03see
03I had a theory too
9try tuning in yourself so you see
if something like that could happen
03which... I actually need to mention to someone
9with the BronyState player, I mean
6lulzsec, get on it
03basically
;p
03basically this way
03whether it's encrypted or not
EW LULZSEC
03every DS game should have it as epart of the ROM, right?
I can see it on the preview.
03so my idea is
03take every DS ROM you can find
9hmmm....
03open like 27 thousand hex editors
03see what's common between all the files.
9probably due to
Check for parts that match :O
03Do that, you;'ll find the key
03Right? XD
9the renderer?
Who has the time for that xD
2 FMEs is using up all my RAM anyway.
9try closing VHScrcap
03but I might be over-simplifying this, as I don't think it would work
03dude
9and clicking on them
03if they can convince literally thousands of people to run a program to try to find the key
9derp I mean
9close VH Scrcap
03they can do the same thing with hex editors LOL
9and reopen it
Yeah XD
03you'd be surprised what a large fanbase gbatemp has
03they have like 20 thousand members or something
But they should start with the smallest ROM first :P
Nice o.o
03actually I made that number up, let me look for real
Are they all evil hackers
9yeah
03no, but the forum is devoted to Wii/DS/3DS hacking XD
9the LQ stream doesn't have that problem
03why it's called *gba*temp I don't know, they probably started it back0 when GBA was the newest portable system
9theeeeeeeeere we go
9nice and ready
03DUDE
9okay, press play so we can judge video quality and fluidity
DUDE WHAT
03http://gbatemp.net/
03Look at top news story
033DS Save De/Encrypter v1.5a
03Windows Based Application
9also your monitor is huge
HAHAHA
Input seems to be lagging for me.
03Someone figured out some sort of master key for SAVE files at least
03:D
Ironic/timing
I've got 2.5GB RAM.
9yeah, there's some heavy skipping all right
03NOW SOMEONE FIND THE PROPER KEY ALREADY DANG IT LOL
9I only got 1.8GB
9 2 if you round it up
Also, I just realized something. When I bought my new pair of Chuck Taylors, they are Rarity-colored.
inb4 someone cheats using saves and that key?
Well I'm at 100% CPU usage.
03as who doesn't want a 3DS flash card for their 3DS
9maybe it's due to your GPU?
I do
9oh
(Violet and white)
9that explains stuff
I WANT FULL VGA 3D PICS ;.;
03you can just edi tyour save to have $9999999 etc
03LOL
9is anyone else getting skipping?
03VGA is not going to happen
03the top screen is still only 320 pixels tall
i've done it on my DS :P
03not 480
03er wait
03is it even that many? It might be 240 still :/
Maybe we can like...crush the pic down :p
No
9yeah
240 "|
033DS has really terrible specs
03That being said
Crappy res
03it works
Sadly
Night
9probably because of that
03but I was majorly disappoint when I read about it
9night Nittany
03that and NINTENDO GO FIX THE DS UPSCALING TYVM
Hmm.
I love how the regular pics are VGA res
03but 3D aren't
03yeah
Unless I was seeing thing
Yeah
03nope
03even the DSi does VGA res
03granted that's still horrible
03640x480 photos are so 10 years ago :/
9are these your only open programs?
Or for webcams
03dude
03webcams now do like 6 megapixels
HD webcams
xD
Other than IRC, yeah.
I know
03^
03even this crappy laptop webcam does 2MP
9maybe we should have you run Game Booster...it might lower some of your CPU load.
I've got AVast! running.
1.3MP is fine enough for me :P
03yeah
03well
03VGA is 0.3MB
03*MP
03if even that
03@calc 640x480
= 640
anyway, sleep for reals
03...
03oh
03@calc 640*480
= 307200
9the quality looks good, but the skipping is bad
Bye.
03yeah, 0.307 megapixels
12@calc 9
= 9
Yeah, the input on the preview is skipping.
9so yeah, dari, it's probably too high a CPU load
12that calc is so awesome
12it figured out that 9 = 0
03rofl
129*
03Sheep Goes Left: DS Test
03NEW NDS Homebrew
03SOUNDS SO FUN
03SHEEP GOING TO THE LEFT
03OMFG WHO WANTS TO PLAY
/me hides
I hope the Wii U has a decent
9what CPU are you running?
IT IS THE NEXT ANGRY BIRD
*BIRDS
XD
03LOL
03the sad thing is that most DS homebrew sucks
9not sure if this might help, but
03unlike Wii homebrew which is generally awesome
Exactly
Wii homebrew <3
DVD, Games, PC ports
STUFF
03we need to get some good DS homebrew devs
ah
WW2
03HAHAHAHAHAHA
What happened :P
03Someone made a new cheat engine for Wii
9skipping is much better now
03geuss what they named it
03Accio Hacks
9but still present
03Harry Potter FTW?
9I'm thinking your CPU can't take the load
Yes :X
I only use GeckOS
morning
9hey Pinkie
Or what the thing was called
2.80 GHz CPU 2.5 GB RAM
9I'm running 3.2 GHz
03LOL, they changed their slogan to "underground gam7ing community"
9albeit the model of the CPU is more important
03-7
03Nintendo prolly got pissed
Underground from Nintendo xD
Yeah
03as seriously gbatemp still is centered around Nintendo hacking
03which is why I love it
03I need to start going to their forums on a regular basis again
http://wiibrew.org/ < NOOOOOO
9the quality is much better though
It has a 503 error
;.;
03OK so yeah
03We have 265,001 registered members
03265 thousand members
03of gbatemp
Nicee
03also
032744 user(s) active in the past 30 minutes
03imagine if TST forum was that active
03we'\d need like 40 mods
How many mods to they have?
03not sure
03but of the 216 members on the site right now, only one admin
03hm
03there are only two administrators of gbatemp
9dari, this might help http://majorgeeks.com/download.php?det=5952
03let me check global mods
Over 900 admins
Hrm
036 o.o
mind pausing the episode if you stop watching it?
That is terribly SMALL
o.o
03and then 6 non-global mods
03I know
03ratio wise that's HORRIBLE
we can't see nothing
03Those guys must be insanely busy XD
03that being said it takes mods like 3 days to \delete posts >_>
03-\
I'm surprised that place is still decent :p
9yeah, Dari, it follows the window's location, not when it's blocked
03yeah
03oh trust me
Think of all the noobs there XD
03there's a fair share of trolls
03wel
03*well
03see
03that's the nice thing about the Wii and DS hacking threads
03noobs wouldn't even know what's going on
9aside from the skipping, that looks really damn good, Dari
I'm using a program to keep it on top.
Only teens/adults would use it?
JACK HARKNESS
03now the threads about general Wii gaming, sure, that's prolly crawling with noobs
Or geeks that is :P
03but I dont'even bother with those XD
03I only care about hte hacking stuff
Same
03*the
I don't even have a Wii anymore
HOT
And I refuse to buy a new one
As the Wii U and hacking is near impossible now
03hm
03there are 5 "supervisors"
9PEDOING A LEGAL BABE
03yeah, luckily my Wii still works, my modchipped one XD
My Wii was stolen
9is anyone else getting any skipping?
03:(
Along with my Dsi z.z
DSi XL that is :P
But nope, don't touch the GCs, PS2s, DSses or SNES
no more skipping here
03it reminds me o;f my friend usotsuki
03someone broke in and stole his modem and his girlfriend's t-shirt
03and that's all
Some skipping, but not that bad
9I'm getting some slight skipping
6...
03they left all the computers, TVs, gaming consoles etc there
JACK SAVES THE DAY
03I was like, WTF?
6thats ridiculous
9like Pinkie
03who steals a modem
Fail much
Someone who doesn't have internet?
03that being said he lives in a trailer at the moment
or well, just video, audio doesn't
03well
6I'd be on about the shirt, modems are understandable LOL
03a modem doesn't do you crap unless you actually have an Internet line going to your house
03...
03uso has like four computers
Definitely watchable, still.
03why would they not jack one while they're stealing the modem
03XD
Wat
9yeah
DAT PAUSE
9but you know how I am
9OCD with streams
Insanely stupid theifs
03granted I'm not saying that would have been gooed
03but everyone on #P-O was like WTF
6no see, you could at least sell a modem or something
And I only have three PCs in this house :<
6the shirt.......I still dont understand
6but yeah
Me neither
Shirts
9video quality is great though
Why
6why not grab computers lo
03*thieves
/me hides
03that's true
03maybe it was a pair of jeans, not a shirt
03either way it was just one single clothing item
6even then though
9anyways, dari, I think I'll have to continue this tomorrow.
6CLOTHES
6WHY
03^
Ok then.
Thanks for the help DCD.
9sure thing
03also oh god Aurora, have you seen the new Android marketplacde?
03-d
03I hate it so much
9your stream leveled up quite a bit though
9so I guess you will be happy with that
6no i havent
6I shall look
03woah, $130 23" monitor, not bad
>taking food from starving children
Like a baws
dat error beep
6ugh
Awesome
6I liked the old market way more
03I know right
Dat installation finished beep
:P
03this new one is way too weird looking
03the only good change they made
03if you go to My Apps, there's a section dedicated to "What's new in this version"
03which is something I've wanted XD
lol
03since I'm like... why am I updating this
Great episode, this
Hmm
03http://sale.images.woot.com/An_Elephant_in_Bantha_Clothing7leDetail.png <- LOL
CPU usage is abnormally high for some reason.
It's not normally this high.
The player is using 30-40% O_o
VLC uses next to nothing.
6lol
What
O.o
Looks Star Warsy
03it is
03:P
what cpu do you have dari?
/me reminds self to rewatch all the films
03anyway
03need to wake up in like 8 hours, final exam in the morning :/
03so off to bed
!sneas
:o
Well compression sounds like the most intensive part.
Hi.
So...what's up?
/me finishes typing last words in chapter three of The Midnight Reshiram. Woo-hoo.
The what what
Oh, hey Prison.
ohai prison
PRISON! Welcome back
its cool guys, just writing clopfic, don't mind me
Lawl.
ah fuck, and i'm in another RP name today
lol
it gives you an idea of what the fic is about :P
ignore the new name, gonna go be quiet in my shipping channel
yfw you realize that's an 'n'
We're just watching some Doctor Who at the moment.
dari...read his name
closelier
Wut?
its Mare
...
A fanfic I'm writing since I'm stuck on the other. I was in a parade today that was on the news. Me and my foster Great Dane, Spencer, walked in front of some of the cameras and they zoomed in on us.:D
hate you so much right now ReticentSmolder
Lawl.
lol
so much...
oh someone's getting shipped tonight
its gooooooooooooooooooood FFun
>implying someone isn't always getting shipped
... bite me. actually, don't, i don't know how this body reacts to anything
haha
Youtube clip plz
OK.
/me thinkgs SilverMare settled into genderswapped rp a little /too/ easily
>implying #silvershipper wasn't created by me for the sole purpose of perpetuating shiping
>_>
gender wrap up, gender wrap up
O_o
...oh wait
fuck. you. with a rake.
i need chocolate. NOW
I'm sorry, I really don't mind the R. :P
02*WB03(Drake03)02WB* - <Lyon> 04I hate you all
"What a beautiful chocolate man!"
god, i am temperamental tonight! im sorry RobotPinkie
Anyone get my reference?
... no?
Scared of Prison with the genderswapped shipping.
off*
XD
lol, i don't think it's possible to scare PRISON off, he's fucking insane
well, he ain't in here no more
he probably was bored
He didn't say anything.
Maybe he didn't mean to come in? Recovered tabs or something.
and then the US arrived to save the day.
Lawl
You still have to connect, though, even with recovered tabs... or at least I do.
I dunno.
Ohai Victor Meldrew
I sure hope Hunk doesn't show up to save them... that'd be confusing.
Couldn't find any. It aired just an hour ago...I think.
lawl
I'll get the video or at least a picture tomorrow
But yeah! I WAS ON THE FRICKIN' NEWS! :D
Now this is just scary....
OH GOD
THIS IS HORRIFYING
freasky plus!\
Yay!

Before full conversion.
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHA
I'm going to test something out...
Cool.
I'm thinking it's only a matter of time before the world is mostly bronies.

Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
yay for that virus RobotPinkie
He's gunna get you!

12"It sucks" was originally going to be used as one of the taglines for the film, but the producers felt that it worked too much to the advantage of disappointed audiences and critics.
6lol
Hahah
You're not his type. Lawl.

Eeyup

12Those aren’t the best
12i know
this is more like it
/me jumps up on the pole
/me throws bits at Sluttershy
/me slides down low, keeping her rear to the audience
HOOOOOO!
12Hope it goes away soon :<
/me does a flip
hmm, umm, does this count?
umm, I've never tried lapdancing before. this should be nice
12thanks
*clop clop clop*
12should be fun
12XD
12i don't care for them
12the taste is too dominant
/me gets up and walks back on stage
/me empties his pockets
12coming from the guy who has to spam everything with jalapenos XD
/me throws all his money
oh, um, thank you
12XD
12dunnno
12i think it's the mayo
12I love adding jalapenos to stuff
It looks like my only other customer got scared off.
12same
poor stripes
I had a special gift for him also :(
?
why is i paw?
12Some of the things I add jalapenos to make my friends go wtf XD
oh, um, so this is THAT kind of party.
ok then :)
Oh you in for a treat stripes.
/me starts stripping
12Like how I add loads of jalapenos to my potato salad xD
12XD
hmm, lets see, these can go.
12i've added hot sauce to popcorn
12lol
/me pulls off shorts
12well
12I should try that some time XD
12the bottle suggested it and i thought "no way" but i was crazy enough to try it anyway
12turns out i should have stuck with my instinct XD
12Ah
and this also.
/me pulls off shirt, revealing a bikini
12as much as i hate to say it
12not everything tastes good spicy
/me steps down and walks over behind stripes
12True
mmm, you're pretty tense. maybe a massage would help?
12blah
12i just washed off the air purifier filters
12and now i'm trying to get them to dry
12lol that kind of stuff take such a long time to dry XD
12takes*
/me begins to rub stripe's shoulders and neck
ooohhhhh, yessssss.
/me purrrrrs
12actually they are awfully close
/me walks around in front of stripes, and runs a finger from his stomach all the way up to his chin
mmmm.....
12Ah, that's good
12They seem to take forever to dry whenever I do them though D:
12because i'm just so crazy that i talk to myself on a chatroom
/me winks at stripes, running a quick hand across his crotch before walking over to dari again
That's why I was confused D:
12XD
12well
12this filter confuses me
/me requests more mood music, if, you know, that's alright with you...
12i look at the filter and it says it's supposed to capture really fine particles in the air
12but i can easily see right through it
12how can a filter with large holes in it capture such small particles
12XD
12Dunno
o.0
12i see metal tabs on the filters
12maybe an electrical current runs through the filter and magnetizes it
hehe. Since I only have, you know, two customers I can. umm tailor more to their individual needs....
12That actually would make since
12since~~~~
12Some filters are all metal
cusomers!?
12this is like plastic though
now now boys, we've got to take turns now.
/me leans in close, and plants another kiss on dari's lips
12i remember getting the filter because it said the filters were washable and reusable
/me moans.
Mmm, you taste good. ;2,15)
12then a week or two afterwards XD
/me checks his wallet...empty
/me sits down in his lap, wrapping her arms around hos shoulders
12XD
12the neighbors through out a couple of those bionic air filters
12that used to be advertised on tv
12*threw
12lol for some reason that stuff never works |D
12ionic sorry
12well
12i used them for awhile and they seemed to work
/me gets the popcorn out to watch!
12then i learned that they release ozone so i stopped using them
12because you are trading one pollutant for another
/me breaks the kiss and runs her hands accross his chest
mmhmm, does that feel good?
12That's not good lol
Ohh, yeah.
12but it's still there
/me runs her hands under dari's shirt, easing it upward over his head
12brb shower
12at this time?
12Yep |D
/me leans in close, pushing her chest up against dari
12ok
/me puts his arms around Sluttershy, resting them on her rear
/me squeezes
12I have somewhat of a headache,
12hopefully the shower will make it go away
mmmmmm.......
/me reaches down and fishes for the button on dari's pants
only if you want big boy ;)
What do you think stripes?
12usually dark quiet places work
im still eating the popcorn!
Go on then, naughty girl. :P
mmm ;)
/me pulls out the camcorder now
/me unlatches the button, and pulls dari's pants all the way off
/me runs a hand starting at dari's ankle, slowly pulling it all the way up to his inner thigh
mood music, mr. dj? ;)
/me notices the *ahem* problem in dari's groin
Is that a present for me, dari?
;)
You going to unwrap it?
(;
mmm that's what I was hoping for.
/me pulls down dari's boxers
/me 's eyes light up
hehehe
/me leans down quickly, taking the entirety of dari's cock into her mouth
/me gasps.
Oohh, you'rse so good, but so /bad/ baby.
>stream
>the most appropriate video
/me grins, and begins to move up and down
/me puts his hands on the back of Sluttershy's head
Just like that.
/me reaches up and wraps one hand around the base of dari's cock, leaving the other free to caress his lower stomach
/me moans and closes her eyes
/me begins to move her head faster

12demoman and pyro
12i just can't do anything with them
12but i can't aim to save my life
06if you try to use the sticky launcher on offense it's really devestating lol. Pyro is easy to play but hard to play effectively.
06and same I'm terrible at aiming xD
12lol
oooooh TF2
I need to move the server still
12spies
12i've messed around with them a little bit against AIs
12lol earlier i was being a spy and snuck up on an engineer tending to his turret, he also had his little dispencer behind him
12*dispenser
12i sneak up on him and put a little zapper on the dispenser, then put one on the turret and kept going back and forward because the engineer kept on trying to remove the zappers instead of killing me
12eventually i managed to kill the dispenser so i just keep on putting zappers over and over again on the turret as he removed them XDDD
06that's quite useful if enemies are just clustered up by a dispenser
06unless there's a pyro there ofc
12lol
12he was all alone
12and i found it funny that the ai wouldn't kill me
12after him constantly wrenching the turret i managed to kill it through endless zappers then he killed me lol
06yeah, they can't realize disguised spies are spies unless you bump into them
06or they see you sap, I always get accidentally wrenched lol

someone in there?
ohai Barry
How are you, Dermathil?
I'm fine. Slightly tired but fine.
how about you Barry?
egh
/me refreshes his emailbox
Hello?
Ohai everypony!
hey ZIltoid!
FINALLY PEOPLE ARE SPEAKING!
hurray!
dude
I just got a sick internet upgrade
my streaming isnt bad anymore
nice
is sathi streaming?
Btw, any of you ever heard of extra credits?
I dunno Ziltoid.
Extra Credits?
I think it may be Dari who fell asleep during streaming.
extra vredits is on escapist right?
Yes, Pegacorn. Ever heard of that?
Yes Ziltoid
I only saw one episode
@Dermathil:Nope.Never heard of it.
its bascily commentary on the gaming industruy right?
They had a fundraiser event to make for the injuries of their artist, and now the news came out that the escapist took 75% of that money.
oh what
yeah
Thats some fucked up shit
the artist needed shoulder surgery
is this that thing about the escapeist?
yeah
I was a big Extra Credits fan
also hoy hoy all
hey Winter
Hi guys
hey winter-puff
and barry
It's terrible what some people will do
basically, Extra Credits are leaving the Escapist.
but is their artist gonna be alright?
Also, they supposedly owed 9000$ to the Escapist after not being paid for almost a year.
yeah, Ziltoid.
ya i heard bout that somthing to do with not getting paid and other shit
sounds crazy
Even with 75% of the money taken by the Escapist, they had amassed over 100K$
so the 25K$ surgery happened
That's good, though, that they could still amass that much, even with an idiot like the Escapist
wait actually it was a 15K$ surgery
brb
I wonder if h/she was arrested\
(it was a Rockethub fundraiser)
and who was arrested you wonder?
This is a legal affair between lawyers now
so far the fundraiser raised $99,018
/me listening to hop skip and jump full version
the goal was 15K$
just, check this page. http://www.rockethub.com/projects/2165-extra-credits/posts/740
these guys are among the most idealistic (in a GOOD way, since they can GET SHIT DONE) people I've seen in the internet.
As much as I hate what the escapist did with that, that's the administration. What I've seen of the personnel that posts the news and the stuff like PR, they're great guys. I think I'll continue to go there for my video game news.
some of the brighter stuff they made possible: http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/112180-Miracle-of-Sound-to-Premere-Mass-Effect-Song-Live-with-BioWare
I dont go on gaming websites anymore
Because I dont have enough money for games
:(
don't worry.
The Escapist is for news and not just videogames.
They've got a section about movies and anime and everything too..
The Escapist is for those who wants to "escape" from normal life, in a manner of speaking.
I think it was Avatar lol
eh
Haven't seen anything like that since Avatar, actually
Opening the door almost meant pushing people with them
not really
I heard it is very good
hes not all that speacial
well I mean
exactly
hmmmm
oh what
really?
yeah
eeyup
thats crazy
well, there's that and the fact that I'm a sucker for all the marvel movies.
(looking forward to the Avengers movie greatly. With Cap, iron man, Thor, Hulk all together and kicking ass.)
because that's what it is headed
whats next before avengers?
or is that it?
I think it'll be the Avengers.
Though I already heard of a Thor 2 in the way
after Avengers
Did you get reply for your modship?
not yet
Me neither
What would I need for streaming here?
just some basic software and acess to the veemi server
I would guess
and a good upload rate
Hm
Hai guys
>yfw Torchwood is an anagram of Cow Hotrod
what&
>suddenly everything makes sense
cow hotrod is key plotpoint
Well I haven't gotten that far yet, but I'm sure it will be.
Hey RP
'sup Dermathil
The extra credits-Escapist crap is making me a sad pony...
What's that?
oh, just that a great show that spoke about the gaming industry and the making of games decided to leave after not being paid for after a year and the escapist taking 75% of the money they got from a fundraiser for their artist's shoulder surgeries
Wow, wtf?
(they appeared once on EqD because one of their guest artist for the show while she was in recovery put a pony picture in one of their episodes since that guest artist was a brony)
yeah, RP.
also, the Escapist said they were owed about 9K$.
02*WB03(Skylands03)02WB* - <Skylands> 10Apparently I saved myself a memo last night titled "cake" and all it says is "I love it so much"

AFTER that whole thing?
10lol4
That's a mostly administrative crap, so the guys that make the news and the content on the website are still in my esteem. but the higher-ups are now crap in my eyes.
Yes, RP.
well
hi skylands
10Hiya Nick
I think it was said that they considered the debt paid through the 75% cut from the fundraiser.
Yeah, a fundraiser for shoulder surgery that was made because the guys didn't have the 25K$ the escapist didn't pay them
(their pay)
That sounds... uh... somewhat greedy.
link to the fundraiser page http://www.rockethub.com/projects/2165-extra-credits/posts/740
I guess it can help explain stuff
03D:
oh, and if you want a very complete picture, here. http://www.escapistmagazine.com/forums/read/18.305970-Extra-Credits-leaves-the-Escapist-UPDATED-WITH-DANIEL-FLOYDS-EC-WRITER-COMMENTARY
look at the number of pages in that forum thread.
over TWO THOUSANDS
(wait. no. Not two thousand pages but two thousand replies. my bad)
That's a lot to read. :P
yeah
Kind of surprised Escapist Magazine allows the thread to stay.
well, I think it wouldn't help them if they closed it.
I think it is because they might want to let the people speak their opinion about the thing.
That's true, I guess they also have their side of the story to tell.
10!sneas
/me now belongs to Skylands for 18 minutes
eeyup
Streamstreamstream
they are now gonna release their videos on youtube.
their latest video about MMORTS here if you want: http://www.youtube.com/extracreditz
Well, then they can become Youtube partners and actually get some money, maybe
maybe.
Just have to wait and see, I have seen some of their past videos and enjoyed them.
This mmorts video sounds great btw.
the idea they've thrown in there about how to do it is really good.
I'll take a look after this episode of Cow Hotrod
alrighty
I guess they're trying to get into game publishing
Yeah the surplus of funds they invested in an indie game project
Could be interesting
well, James is an actual game developper
Oh okay, who has he worked for?
What surprises me is that, some of the ideas they stated for an MMORTS to work
ARE being used for the End of Nations MMORTS
Rodman, they mentionned EoN in the video
I know, I'm just excited for that one
(also, I think I may have found James Portnow's curriculum) http://www.linkedin.com/pub/james-portnow/5/636/150
Nice
But as I was saying
50+ players in one map in EoN
I REALLY want to see how that works when it comes out
Specially seeing as the many of the original Westwood crew are working on it
They said that they think that a successful MMORTS will probably use the pointcost system that Warhammer and Warmachine (two tabletop games where you make an army that's costing a specified number of points beforehand and then throw the armies against eachother)
uses.
You give xp to the units, and the stronger they get the higher their cost becomes.
(that's the mmo part of their suggestion)
<---- *long-time C&C fan*
Yeah, I see what they're going at
ohai Dman
Hey, Dman, sup?
he left
Awwww
OH WELL
Dammit somebody need to stream something
:/
Ziltoid, watch this in a loop.

alright
bababababrarararara
Took a break from the hotrods to check the video, and I think he makes some very good points. Unfortunately I wouldn't be interested in a MMORTS :P
Too bad
yeah, I wouldn't be interested in a MMORTS either.
I, however, can't wait for EoN
Why's that?
But in most of their videos they make very good points. And that's why I love watching them every thursday.
Y U NO LIEK MMORTS? :(
lol I'm just not a big fan of the RTS genre.
Good point
Then again, I'm the type of guy who gives a fangirl squeel whenever Paradox announces a new game
Im gonna go play some games cya guys later
Cya Ziltoid
later Ziltoid
Welcome back Nick and hi everyone
Heya Sky :3
It's not that I mind strategy games as such, I love the Tactics/Shining Force style of games.
10:3
:2
I guess I prefer playing games for the singleplayer, so I don't think I'd really like an MMORTS. Though the warhammer-like pointbuy system I might like due to me loving Warhammer 40K
03:3
Played Dawn of War then?
Got DOW2
Got a cousin with the 1st one
(I got every expansion for DOW2)
I also don't like losing half the battles, so online play in RTS isn't really for me. :P
I get you RP.
Then again, I do tend to focus on turtleing alot so...
Yippee, pointage!
ON THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA BEEEEEEEEEEEYATCH!!!
Random Fun Fact: Red Alert 2: Yuri's Revenge had a mission where the Soviet Union took over the moon.
I should play more FPS games online, though. I don't mind getting a 1:1 kill ratio when it's fast paced and fun. :P
nice.
Hallo
I know of a FPS in space where I had a 14:1 KDR
ohai barry
Hello there Barry
over 50 kills and only 4 or 5 deaths
(I think it was only 4 deaths)
That's pretty good
yeah
pretty niche game thoughé
http://lhcathome.web.cern.ch/LHCathome/Physics/ < LOL
and by "pretty" I mean "really"
You're in space with a jetpack.
Makes you need to take the 3rd dimension when looking for enemies
since NO GRAVITY
no idea what it is
BTW, here's gameplay of EoN

{1,0You0,4Tube}: "End of Nations Trailer" - "Destroy 51 players in this PC RTS."

Yeah I just checked out that trailer, looks like it'd be fun to watch people play
I'd happily jump into that action
That is just freaking amazing (for me)
trailer for the game btw http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPS54YZ5MyE
{1,0You0,4Tube}: "Shattered Horizon Last Stand" - "Shattered Horizon is an innovative game from Futuremark Games Studio that immerses you in the cold reality of combat in space like no other game before. With..."
the shooter where I got my kick-ass kdr
Looks pretty cool
yeah
wish I had a PC I could play games on...
Oh man
also, the guys behind that game are now working on a similar game where you're in a space fighter instead.
That game looks sexy
You know, like a dogfighting game in space.
Well I can play SOME games...
Oooh, I like 3D dogfighting games
A dogfighting game in space...
2D ones.... not so much.
Man, makes me miss Tachyon: The Fringe
hi SS
I got to dust off that one
Hiya

lol oh wait, I have Lair

Hallo, Pegacron
hey pegacron
/me turns into Pegacron
Somepony called me?
Two people here think Pegacorn is a Transformer, apparently
Well, he is, according to.... something or other.
everybody called him like that.
I was considering saying Pegacorm, instead.
......I must do something that only my Transformer form can do!
/me punches through a building
some gameplay from the game I spoke about just a little while earlier to keep you interested and occupied. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaRQd2iElFo
{1,0You0,4Tube}: "Shattered Horizon Gameplay 1080p" - "Some more SH gameplay, this time in 1080p it is a different video than the 720p. Sorry but Fraps makes 1080p videos very short so it is in 2 parts. Enjoy! As..."
Ooooooo,a FPS!
yeah
Pegacorn, I once got a KDR of 14-1 in there.
I died four times.
Over 50 kills.
Jesus, this episode is getting scary.
what episode?
I mean Celestia, not Jesus.... damn, I keep forgetting
what episode are you watching?
"To the Last Man"
it's season 2
eh, doesn't ring a bell.
Wow Dermathil,you're pretty good at that FPS!Because,of course,not everypony can get a KDR of 14-1.
ah
yeah
I might have been in a good phase though.
Not always that good.
It's ok.Sometimes,you're better at a game then other times.
yeah
I do get my moments.
Man, in TF2 the only classes I can play effectively are Medic and Engineer
I'm pretty much a Heavy Weapons Guy player in TF2,but sometimes i try the other classes.They mostly end in a bloody explosion of body parts.
Usually when I get my moments, it's on PSN and the other people disconnect....
So many cowards in Red Dead Redemption, if I'm on a losing streak I still stay until the game is finished. :P
I'm okay in pretty much every class I play.
sometimes I get lucky and my shots basically all turn into headshots
BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM
Yeah I love sniping, too.
Sometimes I've had people rage at me. I've even been accused of hacking once.
he said I was aimbotting.
lol people are like that. If you're too good at head shots, you're using aimbots
yeah
Even in games where you can't aimbot. Go figure.
yeah
so, anybody wants to make a TF2 game?
I have like... 40 hours or so total of online play, though... not very experienced :P
Me,but later since i have to go.
don't worry.
steam says I've got 290 hours played in TF2
Don't have TF2... or well I have it on PS3
RP, it is free on steam now.
completely free
Can't play it, I don't think :/
why?
computer too weak?
(it was a 2007 game)
gtg
I'm on Linux, like... a lot of games don't work as they should
later Pegacron
ah
okay.
I'm slightly familiar with ubuntu.
do I hear a dari waking up?
oh lol I guess it does work perfectly in Linux
still, kind of a hassle to install, I might do it later
(not using it now though.)
I'm on Ubuntu
it's very nice, love using Linux as a development environment
yeah
Programming under Windows is downright painful for me, so many hoops to jump through
lol that's pretty awesome
yeah
when I used ubuntu it was for a programming class I think.
I'm guessing it evens out once you start on really big projects.
I guess...

I haven't been streaming that for ages.

you haven't been streaming it, yet that's what I see
O_o
Same here
you trollin me dari?
Wow.
Nah
ya dari you are streaming a coments section
It's probably because I left the stream on all night.
So you guys are pretty behind.
oh haha
though I'm also watching Cow Hotrod
well, I DO have a pretty behind, thanks
so what's new with everyone?
Lawl
That's weird.
I wonder how long that'll be stuck on the stream.
no idea
Hours.

might need to restart it
Won't help.
see now we should pretend that we're actually watching something
so when DCD comes on
oh, okay

I always say "Eeyup" now. xD

If I'm still a brony in a couple of years, maybe :P
hey man, once you brony, there's no going back
I'd only ever get a pony tatto if I got a tatto.

well we haven't yet seen Season 2...
I'd kill for an icon I could have on FA like that XD
But I'm never getting one. :P

even then, I think it's irrelevant
*que something I'd post on /pony/ as a long rant*
I mean, even if the show dies
lol
will we stop having these kind of things?
alright back
I still enjoy talking to a lot of bronies
Yeah Season 1 will still be awesome, ponies will still be awesome
back from TF2
the fact that we watch ponies has little meaning honestly
and yeah, bronies will still be awesome
129 points in a single tf2 ctf game
it just happened to be my exposure to said community
which is why I hate the "ponychan is dying" threads
^ Lul
Ponychan ain't dying.
Ponychan is kind of meh.
Too much drama.
it's silly to think that people will all of a sudden dislike each other when the show ends
dari, you seen fimchan? its even worse.
lol, normally I'd argue against that dari
well, it's not dying, so
but after seeing amon's thread this morning
I'm starting to agree >.<
lol what thread?
oh god...not sure if I should get into it now that it's deleted
oh it's that bad?
basically brought up a lot of the !!Spike drama again
Spike drama?
Forums > imageboards
:P
^^
fair enough
I agree with dari on this one.
but I haven't really found a pony forum I enjoy
Well, are there any good pony forums?
There isn't really a general pony forum
What I think we need is a forum attached to EqD or something similar.
dat stream lag
still, avoid the drama and there's some fun stuff on ponychan
06lurker sense activate
still haven't fixed the stream thing dari?
6lol
I basically see forums as more organised and structured than imageboards. I find it easier to find stuff on a forum than on an imageboard.
like the cooperative stuff that people do, and people are helpful with tips on doing stuff... and stuff...
Might just be because I'm streaming high quality, it was fine for people last night.
maybe
the thought amuses me
so much
it might also just be my connection
well, its lagging slightly for me too
no idea, here, need to finish my Cow Hotrod episode
So, dari, what episodes were watched after I left?
whoah much lag
We have the last 2 episodes left.
In series 1.
ah
okay
so after I left you watched the episode that was already begun and you didn't touch the others.
So, BAD WOLF is next I guess?

Yeah.

You already own me, silly.
9please tell me your experience
Aurora: try now?
it got a pixely when the explosions started
6!minnet
Who do you think you are?
6k it wors
6works
9yeah that always happens
9that's why I told you
7What should we see?
6lol
9this is the best stress test.
ooh
Minnet: be a anti-brony
o.o
dat cpu usage
yeah
i got PM'd ._.
she's picky.
9seems my CPU can keep up
so shes a brony o_O
because I'm a hawk, L[a]korv
it looked good to me
/me hides
oo
yeah
but I can't speak for the LQ version as I'm not on it >.<
Minnet: be against anything pony.
9I need reports on skipping
/me is against anything pony.
no skipping on my part
7no skips so far
no skipping
9gonna run this opening a few times more
Minnet: be also a stupid pile of code
/me is also a stupid pile of code :B
9please check both HQ and LQ
Whut
yay
7this is HQ?
can I get a link for LQ again?
Minnet: be smart
/me is smart 8)
/me hugs Minnet
9http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=BronyStateLowQuality
6lol
ty
Minnet: don't be a brony anymore
9it will soon be integrated with its own chat widget
Excuse me?
9but in the meantime
9we're just testing
noooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Minnet: be an anti-brony
/me is an anti-brony
I'll implement a "don't be" later.
7LQ is skipping
k
currently working on some other stuff.. I think you guys might like it.
9hmmm
yeah, LQ is definitely skipping
9I see
9give me a moment
will take a few days before I have the sql layout and interaction ready though.. needs quite some abstracting code.
Good
9going to overclock my GPU and test for performance
heh, be careful with that stuff
make sure your card can handle that
9just increasing it a notch
I've burned through WAY too many cards because of improper overclocking
12sql layout for what?
I'll be back in 15mins, off to make me some tea and food. Stomach's growling.
12oh
9Sathi kick my ghost.
0also we're live
0ready to commence operation?
*Salute* SIR YES SIR!

Aurora, you are a 7Yamask.
I'm getting spikes on both now
9let me guess
/me 6forever sad
9yeah
9I figured
9I believe I know why.
12Tropius <3
9closing all background programs.
6^
9restarting operations
looks like it was animated by the same peeps as one piece
!digimon
9status report?
yeah, LQ still gets spikes
but HQ looks fine
6!digimon
Aurora, you are a 5Indramon.
/me 6to the digiwiki
9gonna test something else
9set different processors to do each stream
9restarting operations!
ah
interesting idea
9report?
hmmm
this is where I'm slightly uncertain
it's certainly IMPROVED in LQ
oh
wow nm
there goes the spikes
9roger
at first it was alright, but now it's exploding on itself
9going to attempt something, restarting stream
06!pokemon
Espeon, you are a 12Snover.
/me 6chops down an espeon for the living room
9streams are live
good to go commander
9commencing testing
I should stop sleeping at 2:15 AM
even though I'm taking leave tomorrow
6I read that as 12:15
interesting
6I'm like dude? that's not even late
9I think there might be some slight.....okay not slight
so the LQ
9there's skipping on my end
yeah
12Same XD
what's interesting
9let me try something else
it's the panshots and the quick camera changes that break it
9that's simple, really
at first, the studdering is nearly impossible to see
9I set priority to both at high
12I don’t usually have a set time I go to bed.
9so going to change again to above normal and test with all processors
so, um. When do you think I'll hear anything again from the application?
12Sometimes I'
lol, you are really excited about that dermathil :P
12will go to bed around 10 others 2am
9Dermathil: we still haven't started sorting through them because we're working on the new domain and it's arquitecture
12XD
9we're live again
Sector Seven is ready for launch sir
ohai stream
you're my favorite customer
7it's lagging
12Last night I stayed up until 4am :B
yeah, HQ got heavily delayed
9made some changes
Myeah, just at the start though
9keep watching and tell me what happens
interesting
LQ breaks at the exact same place every time
that group shot
is always when it just implodes on itself
I'm curious if it's just related to being a LQ strem
stream*
if it's possible
can you try setting the priority of the LQ higher than HQ?
or even run the LQ without the HQ running
9 let's try setting the priority on one above the other first
kk
9done so
9time to start
7skipping
9in HQ, or LQ?
9or both?
7LQ kept playing
alright, at least we know it isn't a stream issue then
I'm only getting the stutters in HQ
op
scratch that
broke at the same place again
9gonna run LQ only
9and then HQ only
kk
9LQ is live
interesting
so it IS a LQ stream issue
I'm getting studders on my end
9so did
9I
Yeah, video stuttering
9let's try running HQ only
much smoother
wait a second
it's after the group shot when problems show up
12!Pokemon
okay yeah it's good
12:3
7HQ many pixels
9Sathi: can't be helped
9video's bitrate for that scene is unusually high
7okidokie is it frozen now?
9let's try something else
9LQ only, FME open only for LQ
is it up?
9LQ is live
nope
same place
9then I have a theory
9it seems we must test another video source
hm.. now to commence the initial handling of the extra database.
9keep an eye on both
stuttering on both I'm getting
9let's try something simple then
9okay
9both are live
yeah, still stutters on both
9ffffffffffffffffff-
though HQ seems to be fine now
just was bad at the beginning
op
spoke too soon
lol
9I paused though
9still
9let me check somethign out
9brb
New rebecca black video gaiz called My Moment, but don't worry already has 493,000 dislikes
I saw that
eeyup
saw it on television last night on the news decided to leave my mark
lol
but then they showed the like dislike ratio bar so I didn't even have to dislike it
.....I GO!
*FF Music*
err...Foto Finish, not Final Fantasy
I will now try another simultaenous stream
aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh
dat static!
KILL IT
KILL IT WITH FIRE
on it
7dat many popups
OH GOD MY EARS
truly this is a recording of Justin Bieber's new album
whew...there we go
7hah it even made my flash crash
7brb reloading...
ba ba ba ba
and back
how is it?
well LQ definitely stutters
its good
no skips so far
on hq
and I'm having trouble with HQ
static on hq tough
LQ stutters
HQ is smooth
back to square one, eh
just a bit pixels now and then
^^
see, I'm not getting the same thing
I mean, it's not NEARLY as bad as LQ
but I'm seeing some small stutters
let's try
suddenly voice
something completely different
rebooting windows updates
ba baba baaa baba baaa baba bararararara
trying something
guys
according to the net
FME 2.5 is better than the one I'm running (3.2)

Heya CChime
He's gone.

Do you know what he figured out?
Not a clue.
lol
he's probably restarting his computer
>yfw I am downloading the entire season of Gurren Lagann in .mp4 format for my ipod and itunes
/me brohoofs Dermathil
That's mfw
okay boyos
9I might have revolutionized something.
9Again.
Oh?
9http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bronystate-low-quality
9get in there
9gonna try streaming LQ there and HQ here
Imma keep both open :P
see what happens
dayum that IS LQ over there
9I can try boosting it a bit
9currently on IE
9for some reason VHScrCap does not detect Chrome
Nah It should be fine for those with need of it
Try streaming video:P
not just pic
ah you upped the LQ
now it looks like what here normally is
9yes
9we'll test little by little
9not relaly
9when a picture is not in movement
9it looks good
So play eet laik I said :P
also, for me bronysatte is about 3 seconds ahead
9okay boyos
9SAKUSEN KAIISHI!
boyos as in a boy/man as in way of addressing, or are you calling us buns? :P
>dat fps on LQ
is it just me? or did you set Fps really low for LQ?
9Report!
like, 5 - 10 fps
9no
DAI-GUARD THEME
9it's on 23 FPS
k perhaps it's me?
9gonna lower the quality on LQ
hq is fine
pretty fluid in HQ
eyup
static is still there
9did the FPS improve when I lowered the quality at LQ?
it's paused rite now..i think
9it is
9gonna run it again
so i can't tell :P
Ah ok
9I "balanced" the quality
now LQ is about 15 seconds ahead
for me
i'll try refreshing
9what you saw just a few seconds ago
refresh both
ofc
9was max LQ quality
9how are both running?
>_< stupid ad
both are fine
9how ahead one is from the other is not important
LQ is about what here is normally, and here is smoother than normal =]
hq is chaoppy
aye
9Zil, HQ IS always choppy for you XD
hmm not to me
9can you give me your opinion on LQ?
its fine now
9okay
9let's test another LQ, then
o lol metro crossovah?
k
lemme see
Metro 2033 + Ponies? O.o
apparently
/me INSTA-POUNCE
lol
"Additional Tags: Adventure, OC, dark, not Fallout "
13ohai :3 ~
13!espeon

offline :(
06:3
for LQ
/me already belongs to you, silly :3
06how was your daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay?
AE!!!!!!
:3
13It was good :3 We played video games and watched a movie
I'll probably be leaving soon.
06That sounds
06awesome
06|D
To dem moun'ns?
Eeyup.
There's apparently flooding in Scotland though.
Bene.
Enjoy
So not sure if we'll do Ben Nevis.
y u no accept challenge?
13Yeah, I'm glad I actually went out and decided to do something for a change besides internet-surfing all day xD
I would.
Family aren't so convinced.
nice, it sounds like that Metro 2033 crossover is good
hmm
never played metro aniways
They don't want the car to be carried off in the flooded roads.
im still worries
06You went out and did something else but you still got your share of game/movie time
worried
06win/win
06:3
I've got some bad news
04meow
04Also
9okay fillies

I aint no filly
LQ still offair for me
9contestant number two
OH GOD MEDIUM
/me sighs
/me hugs the demoman Espeon
Hmm
waiting to get my car's alignment checked
play eet
9sakusen kaiishi!
12my friend wanted to come over today
12but his car isn't working at all
well um. FPS looks better, quality a little lower
12-.-
dat add
LQ seems to still be a little ahead of HQ
HQ being here of course
darnit, can't test the streams while syncing my ipod with the Gurren Lagann episodes I just DL'd
9yeah
Also NewDCD HQ now looks not as high quality as before
9because HQ has to be encoded longer
its really choppy
9really?
9then uStream it is
yay, I don't even know what that means! :P
Still ooks HQ, but occasional frames have dem big squares
whereas bfore HQ was, as other said, ultra smooth
9gonna test LQ
9in uStream again
9do you guys need link?
i gots mine
9roger
9sakusen kaiishi
so is this to compare justin to ustream for LQ?
BAA BABABABABABABAB
BAA BABABABABABABAB
9pretty much
9using a browser streaming service is much less resource-consuming than two instances of FME
9so it should eliminate all lag
okie
HQ still HQ here
9so then we just embed them with our chat
but none of two LQ pages for me have vid right now?
9>forgot to press start broadcast on LQ
9....DERP.
9okay sakusen kaiishi fo reals this time
K hope so =]
AH yup
...yup LQ XD
paused too :P
aaand playin
9tell me how both of them run
BAA BABABABABABABAB
BAA BABABABABABABAB
HQ is stil HQ
LQ is actually quite good
probably best LQ so far imo
9Mission Complete, then
for some reason, again, LQ is ahead by about 4 or 5 seconds
9both are smooth?
...yea
9it should be ahead by 2.5 seconds
lul how u no dis?
9it's only natural
cuz of HQ taking longer to rendar?
9I tested the encoding speed of FME
or something
ah ok
9what you see in the stream in HQ has a 5 seconds delay compared with what I see over here
wait. Will it mean that the LQ will gradually get ahead of us during long streams?
Or will the delay stay the same throughout?
9no, the video delays are constant
nah
alright
oh newdcd ninjad me
9so it will stay the same throughout
9the reason LQ is ahead a bit
great
cuz takes less time to make, cuz is lq?
oh ok
/me 9knows his shit
9well
nice
9I think this mission was a success, Gentlemen
9two parallel streams running at the same time
9okay
9one last test
9Eureka 7's high-as-fuck requirements for the OP
MISSION COMPLETE
9final mission, start!
:P
did I hear Skype beeps?
yes I do hear skype beps
I got on mute, so dermathil u test the sound k? :P wathicng a movie
Sup Silverscreen
hai silverscreen
11DCD it's lagging.
hey Silverscreen
11hi
Sound's good
yeah im lagging too
9anyone else getting the lag?
I don'T see no lag in the HQ
11I am
9aside from the guys with low bandwidth
hammm....
9as expected
uh not really
for me
9Silverscreen: I upped the quality in the main screen because we now have a parallel, low-quality stream
9can someone link him to the LQ?
ustream or j..something
http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bronystate-low-quality Ustream
dman, its called Justin.tv
lolk
Justin.tv http://www.justin.tv/newdcd/b/292354924?utm_campaign=post_live&utm_source=live&utm_medium=url
9justin.tv has been discontinued
9just get in uStream
alrighty
Dermathil you test it out :P I'm semiafk nao
wait, something's not right
9okay SilverScreen
0_0 mare...?
9LQ should work just fine for you
ohgodwhat?
i just can't put my finger on it...
...Mare...?
oh wait
AH FUCK the R63 hasn't worn off yet
ohai Silvermare.
lawl
0___0
OH SNAP
silvermare can now be shipped with any colt and I won't mind
lul
fucking reticentsmolder fed me the blue pill
I get like between 10 and 15 seconds between the LQ and the HQ
02brb
hello dermathil
?
umm... yeah...
dari's in here, and I think polarfire was around earlier
so how was sluttershy last night, Dari?
inb4 new shipfics / clopfics.
9it should be
In fact, R63 - i'll fund it :D
9 5 second in HQ and 2.5 seconds tops in LQ
9as in with the delay, I mean
Eh's a pretty cool guy, dacnes on a pole, and doesnt afraid of anything.
it was lesbian R63, Dman
NewDCD: I mean, I'm feeling like there's a REALLY big delay between the two.
not the only thing she's good at, apparently. i fell asleep with the chat log open, saw over 6 hours of content. wow you 2 were crazy
SHIT
Silvermare - new silvermare x broines. doo eet
The delay I get is almost the length of the entire intro
03o.o
and Dermathil, did you like the story so far? I think RS was doing a good job of making a mare out of me
oh yes he did...
... Celestia banish-it, i just said 'making a mare out of me'
...wat
what did I miss?
alot of stuff Dman.
Anybrony got a pastebin of?
lul
ask polarfire, he had recording
IT JUST PAUSED IN HQ
HEY, LISTEN
HEY, LISTEN
HEY, LISTEN
...recording? as in text thou rite?
like, just now
HEY, ARE YOU LISTENING?
ask polarfire, he had recording
yes Dman
CORN SARN'D IT YES, NAVI :P
Polarfire - wanttobuy recording
yeah, even refreshing the HQ stream doesn't make it jump forward.
9okay there seems to be a big delay
9perhaps if we restart them
The delay is almost the length of the entire intro
The video is starting muted like just now
9that was on my end
9don't worry
the delay?
9the lack of audio
Oh, that wasn't the problem
The problem is just that the whole thing is about an entire intro's length of delay
: /
9we're live on both ends
gray screen in HQ
also gray in LQ
say something so we can calculate the length of the delay
i think i'm going to watch teh stream on my ps3
and type on the comp
9okay
9gonna start
but first, porn!
i mean, fanfic
9someone please open them simultaneously
NewDCD Dermathil keep it up!
i mean ponies
lolololol
9and side by side
9and please count the dealy
i mean... pony fanfic porn...
9*delay
Silvermare implying difference in what ur gonna go on XD
9okay...pressing play in 5
9 4
9 3
9 2
9 1
i'm a chick right now, so who cares
9sakusen kaishi!
both are currently side-by side
the HQ seems to jump a little
who would care if you were a dude?
he freezes then continues
doesn't try to keep up
the delay gets progressively bigger
LQ is fine though
^
no freeze on there
9let me try lowering the bandwidth a bit, then.
Dman, i would care. i would care
HQ is now at middle of video
and LQ just finished
lol k
9we're live
9I think I should have Sathi gauge the delay
9there's a possibility that having both open for you guys is too much on your net as well
9okay
wait for some time
9gonna press play
uStream gets a flipping ad each time the stream starts
NOPE
HQ still freezes once in a while
delay is about 10 seconds now
eeyup
9what do you mean with freeze?
9skipping?
another freeze, delay increasing
no
the stream stops
like buffering
then continues
yeah
9that's actually what skipping is for me
it feels like the HQ stream is buffering half of the time
9that's unnaceptable. give me a moment
yeah
By the end of the video in LQ, it only reaches the middle in HQ
seems consistent
02back
13ohai Ray :3
wb Ray
9both are live
LOL, two different people are talking on phones in this waiting room
it's turning into a shouting match
this is quite fun to watch
aw, the girl got up and left
no skipping up to now
darnit
Just skipped
again
So DRF is in the car place now? o.o
It seems to be skipping less often now
but it still does
9it's probably a bandwidth issue
yes
What do the others see?
do you get skipping too?
yeah i do
:( can't help out right now
Ziltoid says he also gets skipping
9okay
/me climbs onto Angel's head
9wait, skipping in LQ?
9that said
9gonna run this again
9both are live

(Like I said, we're 3 where I live who are huge internet users, so that's basically what we need so we don't step on eachother's internet access
9well I think
And crying too? :P
the mothers of the toddlers are crying over their kids being cut from the show
No skipping in either
Hahah
ah.. the sound of Ensiferum.

A plant!
9I'll have to keep testing tonigth

CYA
damn thats pretty good
dman*
yah
I've got <5mbps down. Looks like I could get 50 if I switched over to cable, but it would triple my bill, include a transfer cap and throttle my torrents again. :/

6well
6there are like 20 touhoumon games
6the one I'm playing
6is imo the best well done
dont get me wrong
luna is great
Although normally I change my fave pony every like hour or so, I think i'm gonna say that Luna's my favourite pony, just to have a fave pony
iLuna....I can only imagine the horror

Hi Aurora

wtf @ news
orly?
some 90 year old just went to college?
Oh?
so basically #request is our new request room
Oh god anymod there?
the email says #request and #requests
which one ees eet?
because every time I click the link
ValtheJean - ages ago. I hink you just email them and ask
oh...
lol
>_< MODS! what is this ? is it #request or #requests
have some pasta: BronyState will be taking video requests in the #Request room in chat. Use the command /join #Requests to join the room.
so which ees eet?
all mods are dead
13I have an emulator, haven't used it in forever though
6you should get it then :D
Don't ask me.
:P
13I remember starting a Moemon Emerald nuzlocke with it forever ago

6I've had my version since december so I dunno, I forgot where I got it
04Touhoumon blue?
6it's easy up until gym battles
04It's not an Emerald hack?
6but even then, it's not overwhelmingly frustrating like emerald
6touhoumon blue is a firered hack
04ah
cmon guys, Dari you're a mod, get in contact
LOL what
inb4 "NO U" kick
04You mean overwhelmingly frustrating like Emerald Touhoumon? :P
We're busy talking about stuffs.
Inb4 ... no, no inb4! c'mon this was a BronyState email
Dari you're talking? tell them then
how do you combine Pokémon with bullets
mind = blown
I did.
ok
dey talkin bout stuffs...stuffs is the same as something! And something is my favorite!
It's not important enough for them to see it.
:P
isn't it silverscreen who does emails? He did the LOTR one at least
lol
6drf don't bother understanding
6it's not with bullets
>not important >tomorrow is friday show.
so then what is it
what exactly takes days and weeks of discussion anyways?
04Touhou professor
6reverse
6touhou characters as pokemon
04vat LOL
so you just play it as normal? LOL
04no duh?
6but that involves understanding how touhou characters actually have personalities and stories, but you said you don't understand how that happens in touhou games so yeh
6you play as normal
6but the people have edited a lot of the game
they have something big planned
6example, Cut is actually useful
04SHOCK
apparently it has something to do with wickerman
/me runs
NO
WAY
6being a 70 base attack, 95 accuracy, and a steel type
/me hides
or I could be completely wrong
04Steel type attack
04nice
04and 70 base attack
inb4 RPS
04that needs to happen to actual Cut
04XD
/me is only going off of the denying wickerman for this week's stream
6they changed a lot of the attacks, some even are renamed and have new animations
6outrage is just hax now >.>
many modchattin' and all that i've seen was NewDCd announcing season 2 show ...IF someone can stream it from their telly, so instantly one who can stream from telly can be made a mod, but others who sent emails in weeks ago have heard nothing.
6it acts like ancient power, instead of being forced to use it twice and be confused
There can't be THAT many requests for moderators, I only know of about 5 or 6 here who sent in emails
12Aurora
yeah, it outrages the player :P
6you use it normally, and you have a chance of raising all your stats
12in tf2 you can't get achievements in practice mode can you?
12it has to be on a server
honestly Dman I wouldn't worry about it
6pretty sure yeah
there's a lot more shit that goes on than we know about
12just verifying
So is said, so tell us what it is?
well
make your own server
...at least I think there is >.<
We have a shit load of things to do.
/me hides
'shit load' what?
All DRF needs is a quantum computer to make bitcounts/crack the common key for 3DS ;P
/me hides
*bitcoins
XD
12guess Aurora i'm going to just join a random server XD
well
I don't know how to program
lol, this is the equivalent of asking about all the hidden boards on ponychan :P
6random servers are fun
12with no people in it and spam rockets with the soldier until i get that one achievement
so I wouldn't be able to use the common key myself
newdcd lookin' for someone to be able to stream season 2, moderating friday and saturday, keeping web updated erry week for next weeks show
12where you get 2 crit missile shots in a row
12i swear i can not get that
06you can get achievements as long as sv_cheats 1 isn't on I think
06and you'll get that if you do a lot of damage over not too long time
06makes the crit chance higher :P
where is this 'shit load,' and i'm not saying there isn't one, there surely is, but what is it?
LOL useless Steam achievements
12hmm
12drf is an achievement
eh, all I can say is that if it's worth keeping a secret in their eyes, best not to press the issue
12get drf to like apple, worth 500 points
I like the gamerscore system :P
just be happy, and post ponies :P
06Saying that any achievement is anything else than useless is odd to say the least.
06Xbox achievements, Steam ones, PS3 trophies
06useless all of them but fun
well
Xbox, at least the more achievements you get, the higher number your gamerscore number is
Discussing, rules, new mods, the way we run things, forums, domains, money, streaming/stream issues, S2 and what we're going to do, availability/what times we'll be busy, general problems/adaptions we should make/how to implement changes we need to make.
on Steam, they just sit there looking pretty
06Oooooh, a virtual number growing.
>bragging rigts
06Yeah, and the gamerscore just sits there looking pretty too :)
In other words.
*rights
ohai bronies.
We have stuff to do.
Ohai.

/me now belongs to Aurora for 11 minutes
let me put it this way
11I'm back. Again.
lol, I was about to say "What happened to your colors?"
on Xbox, you'll have some achievements worth 100, some worth 10
12Espeon
...o kie do kie lo ki
so the 100 ones are more valuable
Steam, not so
12so can you get achievements on training mode or not?
13This mouse is gonna drive me insane .w.
06On steam there's only one kind yes, on ps3 there's bronze/silver/gold. I never denied steam achievements are useless, but they're still fun :P
11Dman: the right channel is the plural channel
Angel I can send you a mouse :P
Soundtrack? : D
extended?
oh, Silverscreen you do the emails right?
xbox has more than 3 different categories </favoritism>
11Yes, I do the emails. #
do you have any USB mice & keyboardz left ?
'BronyState will be taking video requests in the #Request room in chat. Use the command /join #Requests to join the room.' I'm confused as to what channel
me/
*?
about 27 of each.
who else?
11It's the plural one
lo
ah ok then
11it's #requests
nah
but at least 3?
11Eeyup
13Yes, but I doubt my parents would approve of a guy I've never met sending me a mouse in the mail LOL
11Eenope

4Settle down, kids

I'm not angry.

BTW IMO Orchestra, hard/metal rock are best 2 genres. I enjoy all genres, but these the most
06It's fine now

so...classical i guess
ah

Can we all agree that Rebecca Black sucks. Even Justin Beiber?
eeyup
because they at least aren't making music

Mainstream "music" sucks.
12upto 308 vaporeon cards
4Rebecca Black was pulled out of school
4And now she's being homeschooled
lol
They aren't. Their record labels make the music.
eh, I wouldn't go so far to say Mainstream sucks. I mean I dislike a large portion of mainstream, but it's mainstream for a reason
The singers sing the music and make the money.
in that most people like it
4There's a lot of production when it's the mainstream
lolwut
as much as it hurts me inside :P
4Take
4for example
also, imo 'friday' is awful so funny, but black's song 'this is my time' or whatever is ARROGANT AS FUCK and gets me mda

03I was like oh crap, I'm not telling her, I don't want her spying on me
!shipping
03but I get $25 if I refer people to open bank accounts XD
pegacorn - i done about 1/3 wanna see so far or all at tehe nd?
o-o
/me blinks
03Twin Cities is in Minnesota, isn't it?
03or City, w/e
Not yet.I'm reading the new story on EqD.
yes, danny, it is
03OK
03TCF Bank = Twin City Federal
03so yeah XD
:( i wanna do dat tooo...here's a deal: lemme know what the story's liike (a mini review) kthnx
03I only use it because my school has a contract with them, so I can use my student ID card as an ATM card which is kinda convenient
03but yay getting $25 free?
03EVERYONE GO OPEN A TCF BANK ACCOUNT AND SAY I REFERRED YOU SO I GET $25 FREE AND YOU GET $100 FREE
03I mean, hi
yeah, that's a Twin Cities bank
there's a ton down there
not very many up here
03hm
03yeah I'm surprised we have them in Michigan
03since they are semi-local
03but I suppose Minnesota isn't TOO far away LOL
Ok
mhm
but you guys have Super One too, or at least the UP does
03we have like over 9000 different banks LOL
03my college even has its own credit union
03I just use TCF because as I said, the school told me to LOL
oh wow
03hey, as long as I get a Visa, I don't care
03and I have my TCF Visa so I can buy online etc
yup
03plus I prefer debit to credit
03credit is so sketchy
/me checks for EqD updates from while he was working
their a good bank I hear
03sadly you can't get far in life without having a credit score :/
^_^
O LOL this meetthe is gunna be fun
03but with debit, if you don't have enough money, it gets declined
Best tag ever: "Michael Bay is a bad person"
03which might be annoying but that way you're never in debt
LOOOL
True dat FreezeFrame
it's only annoying if you find yourself low on cash
!
03but that's what I mean
what about 'definitely not twixe' or 'definitely not grimdark'
03I'd rather just be like "crap, guess I can't afford this" then be like "shoot, Ic an't pay this bill" and find myself in debt :P
OH GAWD pegacorn this is golden
(almost donies)
yes
as a stewdent I get a 0% overdraft
I do like "definitely not twixie" :P
no wait, 'No Twixie here no Sirree '
03Nice
i love Twixie fics
which was fortunate, becuase the student loans company was £50 short of paying my tuition fees <<
03I'm a student, but I have to pay $35 a day if I overdraw
I don't generally like them, but that's because I think the Twilight/Trixie dynamic works better with them as sisters or half-sisters.
$35 a day?
03yep
How could you possibly ever afford to pay that off? :
03used to be $25 every time you made a transaction
03but they changed it
03I KNOW RIGHT
WUT
03that's why I try not to go over
DMAN,GO GO GO!
ALMOST DONE
03anyway, gonna shut down for a while, I got my replacement CPU cooler and I'm tired of my computer overheating

so I can sort of pronounce Sindarin... but I still haven't left the Shire
Ahaha
With the weather having turned, I think I might even go out on the deck to work on it for a bit.
ack dunno how to feeneesh it
and pegacorn - uh, um, you might uhm...

stuff
Wut?
how to feeneesh eet
And that rain came on the heels of brutal heat
What is it Dman?
I actually haven't read LotR, only had a marathon of it one weekend
The movies, that is
standard or extended editions?
i deed eet
it's a little explicit in 2 or 3 parts, but hey!
I'm pretty sure it was standard but I couldn't tell you
did you read the meetthescout transcript?
I started reading the hobbit, but i got bored
Yes.
[Bringing Sexy Back plays as a newcomer joins bronystate, revealed to be Pegacorn with other Bronies.] [Pegacorn watches various Paraspriters stationed around 4chan: a foreveraloneguy industriously making trolling comments, a fappingfurry, and a Soldier juggling rockets.] [Pegacorn pumps his tollerancegun and Bronies run out to love the enemy.]
i saw M1, and it wasn't that great imo
[Pegacorn charges into a fierce battle on the internet, quickly outloving all his teammates. He internets towards 4chan's /b/, dodging every troll that Parasprites throw at him, then outreplies them and crosses over to /v/ train as /b/ is left with trollers trolling trollers.]
["Meet the Pegascout" text appears] (DADADADA DADA) [Pegacorn chats back in bronysate, to the other bronystate bronies, while posting an image of his OC]
Scout: "Um... I don't even know where to start with you all. I mean, do you even know who you're chattin' to? [Cut to a scene of Bjornfort, Restraining Pegacorn On the Moon while taking a bite out of a flower sandwich, as he pokes his manhood in to Pegacorn's backside]
I got through the first 100 pages, and when nothing happened I put it down
Bjornfot: "Just relax" Pegacorn: "Yeah,yeah,i'll try." [Cut back to Pegacorn in bronystate.] Pegacorn: D-Do you have any idea, any idea how many times Bjornfort had it on with me?"
I read the novel years and years ago, but I think I only managed to wade through it by my determination to impress my peers and didn't properly appreciate it.
[Back to Bjornfort and Pegacorn, while Bjornfort is (, and Dman quotes:,) thrusting faster and faster, retracting his member further and further each time, but always reaching as far in as possible.] Scout: "Basically - kind of a few times!!!" [Back to Moon.]
Bjornfort: shut up pretty boy. You like it. [Bronystate] Pegacorn: [rubbing his flank] "Oh man, that's painful. Ouch!"
(why can't you tell me? you wouldn't have to kill me if you did, would you?)
[Cut back to Moon, Bjornfort now (and Dman quotes again) plunging his throbbing stallionhood as far in as possible before releasing wave after wave of thick, white goo] Scout: " Ya' listenin'? OK. Bronystate streams fridays and saturdays, Silvermar/ne gets shipped with erryone and errything, Pizzapony delivers pony pizzas, and brotha'-
Points to his flank again] I get raped." [Cut back to Moon, Bjornfot retracts his tongue after swirling it around a good couple of times, and when he parts his lips form Pegacorn, a string of saliva is hanging between them]
Pegacorn: "OMG!Saliva!" Pegacorn: [Back in Bronystate] "I take it all!" [Bjornfot feels Pegacorn's throbbing stallion hood release several waves of cum into his mouth.]
Pegacorn: "TROLOLOLOLOLOL!" [Cuts back to Bronystate] Scout: "If Dman weren't at where I was at, this'd'nt be f**kin' hilarious!"
[Cuts back to Moon; Bjornfort is collapsed on the ground trying to reach for his flower Sandwich; Pegacorn teleports away from the Moon, closes RP channel, is back in his chair, and gets up to do important stuff]
[Cuts back to Bronystate, where Pegacorn went brb] Pegacorn: "Oh screw this, YOU'LL NEVER GET ME ALIVEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!" [DAN DAN DAN DAN DADADADA DA] [Dman trots through Ponyville, his cameraphone magically floating beside him. ... :D]
HNNNNNNNNNNNNNG
(n.b. I read the introduction to TLotR and apparently it's "one novel in multiple books")
I feel as if my brain just died
and is now oozing out of my ears
...
hahaha
one novel in multiple books?
a lot is quoting from ... bjornfot moments that i happenned to save :P
yes
lol, I'm sure
because it would be quite unwieldy to carry a 10 inch think novel in your hands
d/w
(i'm super sure pegacorn'll recognise them :P)
you think?
I HAVE IT in my hands
Well actually
he's busy being in the fetal position
crying himself to sleep ;)
LOL
I read it out of my friend's big book that had all three novels plus the hobbit in it
.....Yes.
/me awaits Pegacnr
Pegacorn
Lol. that comment xD
lol
Demoman time!
"The Lord of the Rings is often erroneously called a trilogy, when it is in fact a single novel, consisting of six books plus appendices, sometimes published in three volumes"
=D LOOOOOOOOOOL
also i'm up in 6 hours - g2 get up eraly tomoro
..you want demoman?
/me shoots grenades errywhere
I'm still calling it a trilogy
but what else is there to say?
fine u____u
Yes sir.It's the order of stuff to do that i told you earlier.
:3
Hullo everypony~
but but but I what more cnan I say?
ohai VioletVanilla
ANYTHING MAN.
ANYTHING.
buuuuut
: /
4Oh, FreezeFrame is around
ANY.F'ING.THING.
Pegacron~
yeah, I told him to PM you
Ohai VioletVanilla
HI Ghosties! ^^
did you get his message?
Yo
4Yeah, thanks Val
np
I have a separate copy of The Hobbit
4Anyways, I was wondering if you played EWR?
seriously pegacorn, I don't know if I want to do another on you specifically. Unless it's like a bigger thing or another brony, I mean what more can I say about you :P
I like it like that, since they're both quite different in style
EWR being?
/me is usually not familiar with initialisms
4Extreme Warfare Revenge
@Dman what are you talking about? o:
Well,have a HUGE Meetthebronies thing!It will be pretty cool,i think.
Aah
Yeah, I'd imagine they would be
VioletVanilla - i have done 2 'meet the' for pegacorn
Does that mean you're looking forward to the upcoming movie?
http://static02.mediaite.com/geekosystem/uploads/2011/08/enhanced-buzz-31298-1313003842-17-381x550.jpg
The Hobbit is a children's story really. There's even a bit where Gandalf says something like "young boys shouldn't be playing with fire". TLotR is more mature and grand in scale.
Nope
/me is getting impatient
@Dman How have you done them. . ? X3
going to mall tommorow, I've been DYING for some sushi!
Bjornfot jokes and stuff.
waaait
4Hmm, oh well. Thanks then
The upcoming film will be good if you don't mind the way films tend to diverge from their source material
violetvanilla - in text. wanna see?
Depending
4Hello, Violent. I never said hello to you
Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't
4HWhoops
They've already meddled with the appearance of twelve of the thirteen dwarves as far as I can see

Peter Jackson suited TLotR in my opinion, but whether he'll suit The Hobbit, I don't know.
SAY VIOLENT AGAIN FOOL
Nick: which mall?

I'm not violent though! XD;?
But hi Ghosties! c;

Silvermare! Welcome! C: Glad you could join us here~
(Watching Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, an anime)
I live on a hill and stuff
i've been here, but i didn't pay attention
4Yeah, giggling at me is used so much
did ya read 'meet the pegacorn' ?
and i hope reticentsmolder/mirthtinker gets here soon so that i can get back to my normal name
@ValtheJean: not your fault, the internet is the internet and it's hard to distinguish @_@
haha, fair enough
I know but I mean I want a BBQ FGS for once in the summer
/me floofs
I can't wait to get back to Newcastle though, home feels parochial.
BBQ? rly?
meh!
(I'm back)
lies
13I've had two barbecues this summer
13both in the middle of thunderstorms LOL
I went to a barbecue while the Tanzanians were visiting
(hey Pegacorn)
lol Angel
o.o Nice BF
(Ohai)
12 Hello, GGgala and welcome to #bronies. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
about a fifth of my time there was taken up with shaking hands with Tanzanians. They take forever. o.o
the other four fifths were spent cooking food I didn't have to time to eat! ;n;
lol
So Dman,are you working on another one?
No Pegacorn, sorry
All i'd do is quote more from the fics : / that's no fun, and the joke's up
note to 3DS owners you have 10 mins to get your ambassador programme games
Twas fun though !
what games?
The free ones?
Damn.I got 'Nam flashbacks because of your Meetthe things!
done and done, nick :3
AND I DIDN'T EVEN GO TO 'NAM!
O.O
http://ang.wikipedia.org/ <-- lol
the nes and gba games you can get for your 3ds if you bought it before it's price cut
(lol count: 2)
@luna
ah, right
Wha?
DAMN.
I MUST CHOKE SOMEPONY TO GET THEM OUT!
GET OVER HERE!
you have a 3DS luna?
cos like get connected right now
/me tries to choke Dman
to the eshop I mean
Any Canadian bronies in here?
/me raises his hands, trying to resist being choked.
What the hell man?
I don't, my sister does
What's attractive about free NES and GBA games. Those are easy to pirate, rite, right?
/me stops choking Dman
She bought it with the intent of getting the free games
Sorry man.
Ok srsly nao
ah right she should be fine then
My rage took over.
Despite telling her the 3DS is a marketing nightmare for Nintendo
Gurren Lagann and FiM are my two fave shows in my life so far. And GL has 2 legendary moments. The one i'm currently viewing is one. THIS. IS. MY SOUL.
Ew Piracy
:P
I R PIRATE
Dat 'Libera Me From Hell'
irrational
I have to get my rage out somehow.
Dude - Runnin'
....
/me walks away,finds a RED Spy and chokes him to death.
/me was the red spy
x.x
The spy was Canadian.
ohai guys. I won't be available for a little while, alright?
Oh my god.I killed VioletVanilla!
oh my
Alright Dermathil~
You bastard.
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE PEGACORN?
you mean how people confuse it as another DS upgrade Luna?
cos that's what I did
Well no
The 3DS is doing really bad
also: youtube now updated their embed videos to also be all black and stuff
I mean, to lower the price in 4 months and offer 20 free games just to get people to buy it
I just found a RED Spy and choked him to death!I had no idea it was VioletVanilla!
Not to mention, they've basically decided that "making 3D games out of older 2D games is /hard/"
I love the invitation that Pinkie Pie came up with in Merely a Mare
speaking of
Pegacorn - minireview of latest fics + suggestions on your fave fics
What's the point of expensive bespoke hardware (ignoring the 3D image stuff) when people can already buy a smorgasbord of games on most modern mobile phones?
About my MLP/PR story, I've come up with a synposis for it
well tbh the sole purpose for the slowing momentum was that there were no good games at launch and it's taking a helluva long time for good games to come out
synopsis*
plus it was steep for a handheld
ok
Duh :P
b-but
jk
Smartphones are garbage
THINK OF THE MONEY
/me smile
Smartphone is all I need for games
Minireview?Ok.Honestly,the MeetthePegascout one was the worst.
A decent laptop is all I need for everything *cough*
And Nick, is there any promise that more good games will come out?
Not some half baked smartphone :p
Together, they form the Pony Rangers and battle Nightmare Moon's arsenal of monsters. Will Nightmare Moon ever be stopped?
Triboom? oh dot oh
/me respawns?
also lol barry
I've only seen OoT, the other games look entertaining, but nothing good at all
well yeah Luna, new Mario, Mario Kart and the Starfox remake will be out during the autumn winter months then next year we get the new resident evil, MGS3D and Kid Icarus...
Ohai VioletVanilla.
It's not about what constitutes a sensible consumer decision (does that even mean anything?) - it's about how to make LOTSA MUNNAY
honestly OoT3D can show what the 3DS can do
and yeah BF
I was thinking of putting this up on Ponychan, but without even a sample of the story to go with it, I doubt it would be received well
If that's the case nick, the sensible decision for marketing would be to wait until they had more games to release
Better games
yeah Luna, totally right they did rush out the 3DS no questions asked
: /
once the more higher profile games come in, it'll get rolling
Hey, write a fic ^_^
regardless with Xmas still to come and more promising games coming out, it should hopefully pick up
I've got it in the works, but it's not that far in
it was the same with the ds really, it didn't have many good games for a while until mario kart started boosting up it's sales
lag o_O
Glad to hear it
Hey Dman,wanna play some TF2?
But eh << >>
Pegacorn - I'm busy sorry man

They re-use footage too. For example, in the first episde "From Pole To Pole" they show footage of a female polar bear and her cubs, which was reused in a later episode "Ice Worlds". It took some of the shine off, in my opinion.
7I've been troubleshooting their laptop, which has yet another virus on it.
haha
oh, god, why would she
still g2 read latest cross and arrow
me?
"WE GO"
Yeah
It's all about "DE MAGICKS!"
7I keep on insisting for them to just stick all of their important files on a flash drive and reset the darn thing.
She could do it.
I will always say that the @pony result Photofinish refers to me...since I secretly am Photofinish

and it is supposed to be episodic content and as such to be coming out Quickly?
Activision doesn't have anything related with VALVe.
12SS
12easy
and instead of making EP3 they've been releasing crap like TF2 updates and L4D2
7So, ah, NS, why are you NS at the moment? :P
that's what I thought
12the idea that death is a prescence
Lies :p
which is why I was confused
12instead of a "theory"
12is intruguing
bored
LL i find those movies to be nothing but utter bollucks
12*intriguing

12you forgot Scary Movie 5 :B
I was surprised to see a comercial of another spy kids movie.
why make a good original movie when we can resurect, milk, bash and repeat the same movie from before again? Audiences will buy it anyway because we give them false hopes! */Nostalgia Critic impersonation
He had a reason for his ragequit
Genrespoof Movie (like disaster movie, etc) @LL

No. Activision is the worst publisher in the industry. Valve is the most consumer-friendly.
/me yaaawns
12Wb Ray :3
02Well, going to sleep z-z
02Nini~
But since Activision produces virtual crack cocaine (Call of Duty), no-one does anything about Activision except complain about what they do.

so um... what's gonna happen to the stream in the meantime?
04May?
It's going to flood.
Stupid snow melt.
where are you living, Nittany?
State College, PA.
wait, that's in the Northern Hemisphere, right? Then what's that talk about snow? It ain't even Autumn yet!
June?
P&P seems more WoD inspired than D&D
I was making a wordplay joke on the fact that a web broadcast was called a stream.
ah
Stream. Small river.
heheheh...he...he...
Actually, we did get some flooding last winter when heavy rains helped melt a few inches of snow.
eh.
Where I live we get consistently a few meters of snow every year.
Same.
>canada
Our snowfall seemed to be a little light this year.
Only a few inches per storm.
Our a couple.
Didn't get a really good snow until March.
The winter before was completely different. 12" - 15" in one storm. I've never seen that much snow in my life.
we get snow from late november through late April.
In 2008 we had 6 meters of snow fall on my city.
10July
For a scientist who works with metric units a lot, I still have trouble visualizing meters. Can't even visualize inches.
Conversion time.
I-81 flooded in my city
(due to poor drainage)
The VA highway?
Wow.
I've met some road flooding.
I-81 goes from Florida to Canada, dude
Well, I travel along it when I run from SC to PA.
I'm further north than that.
77 - 81 - 70/76 - 99
Rock Hill, SC to State College, PA.
12March
6 m = 236 in!?!?
That has to be a few yards.
04Abril
04|P
04also hi SKY
04|P
6 1/2 yards.
Augusto
;p
HEYA SKY
04oh look it's mr. clever
/me turns Sky into a lucario
That's a dump-truck dumping of snow.
04Skycario
04...that was terrible |D
Dermathil: What city is this?
10Funny
10On MSN I'm using a Lucario icon
FF: Quebec City
ah, yes
We didn't quite make 200 inches in my city of Syracuse. I was sad.
the one you linked on my profile?
also skycario ftw :3
10No
/me runs
10Was that the GIF one?
04Sky
04Why are you using my horrid hybrid name
04;w;
yeah
04I see
/me goes to Nick's profile to find it again
10This time I am saving it
10Idk, why?
cos Im looking at the fan art section and there's art there looking like hers.
10Link it
ShadowSuicune they're from
http://www.lugia.us/gallery/
its the two newest images
10Hm, good observation
10I can't really be sure though
Ahh. Living in the land of lake-effect snow.
10Maybe you should ask someone else who's in charge of the art gallery
yeah but that also means there's a profile on the forums right?
10Yes
/me 7blinks at Dictionary.com.
7"'Frig' is one of our favorite verbs."
7Wha'cha talking about, Sky?
10[21:04] Idk, why?
10[21:04] <Nick> cos Im looking at the fan art section and there's art there looking like hers.
10[21:04] Link it
10[21:04] <Nick> ShadowSuicune they're from
10[21:04] <Nick> http://www.lugia.us/gallery/
10[21:04] <Nick> its the two newest images
10Then you joined
7I doubt it.
7Yes, the similarities are there, but there are also disparities.'
7-'
7Now, NS?
7What is with your name changes?
Yeah
Living in the true snowiest large city in New York
Buffalo's claim is a lie perpetrated by a single year in which they had 199 inches
Their normal snowfall is under 60
7And about ShadowSuicune; she found TST's IRC.
er, 93.6 is their average
Syracuse's average is 116.4
10I suppose
I was cheering for the record this last winter
Unfortunately, we fell short of our own by 13, and the general by 20
/me 7suddenly notices an overuse of :U she uses.
:U :U :U :U :Y :T :R :E :W :Q
:V
inb4 HML
(You'll find this strange sentiment throughout the Syracuse area. We bitch about the snow, then when we're looking to break records, we cheer it on.
ignoring the video content can anyone tell me where that tune is from and what the tune is called? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm78aD0drgE&feature=channel_video_title

Hmm.... pools of 6-siders, to be totalled, interesting.
03God dang it
03my TST server is still down
03someone needs a serious yelling at
At least Ocean is Still Alive for now
03yes but I mean
03I paid $80 for a year
03the way I see it
03that's 80/52 dollars a week
03my server has been down for a week
03they're starting to owe me money >_>
03plus I'm fricking annoyed as I like island XD
can you link, FreezeFrame?
I liked The Island too
The Island, the movie?
Oh, I see
The game
Hello people
hey ziltoid. crazy conversation going on in silvershipper
The movie's better
03there's a game called The Island?
oh?
03sigh, I can't login to island using my usual ssh login either so it's actually down...
03(opposed to the times when they just reboot it without telling me, and nobody re-starts the IRC| server XD)

Bestiary has rules for Baby Dragons, Buffalo, Griffons, and Zebras
>mfw no further references to drills or spirals beyond the title
Q_Q
03I mean, if they actually responded going "oh, our server is down", that would be a bit more acceptable
03but to just not respond? I marked it high priority, what godawful customer service is this?
(and since Hasbro has rights to both MLP and D&D, the possibilities are legion)
EEYUP
that's how they got the manticore and cockatrices in
That's what I heard at least
You could sue them
Which won't work very well :P
03LOL
03well
03I can report them to the Better Business Bureau :P
Not really
g'day all from the ponystate downunder
03http://failbook.failblog.org/2011/08/11/funny-facebook-fails-john-from-nebraska/#more-41497 <- FAIL
Manticore and cockatrice predate D&D by a few thousand years
never said the opposite
03well
03LOL @ the trolling
03but if that story were true, ROFL
So they didn't need to have those rights to it.
Also, that cockatrice is totally from Fluttershy's chicken coop. One of her roosters laid an egg that was incubated by a toad.
reporting to the BBB can definately have some effect
03they have a forum, and there haven't been any posts since like 4 months ago >_>
03I tried calling them
03phone number is dead
03I mean, WTF

03http://cheezfailbooking.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/funny-facebook-fails-sarah-connor.jpg <- fake as heckl
03-l
03but at least they spelled her name right
03you have no idea how many Terminator parodies I've seen that spell it Sarah Conner which is WRONG
yeah, totally.
That's a stupid mistake anyway
Conner isn't even a name, it's always spelled Connor
They're a Conner
03well you never know, I'm sure SOMEONE might spell it that way
03but yeah, it's Sarah Connor in the movie
03and being a big Terminator fan I get really annoyed when people spell it wrong
03but it seems I see it spelled wrong more often than not :/
Though it reminds me when she guest starred in The Big Bang Theory, funny episode

9status report?
Hmm...I am having much fun with my unicode...
>mfw Pony Canyon is written in the video
9so?
still loading.
1 minute
Denied_Existence: I don't think that last one you used was unicode. I do recognise them as the " that the french uses.
9fawk
Oh hey, I got me some simulones: §
9nobody managed to watch them?
9well going to switch to Dai-Guard
9please tell me your experience
Well, I watched the HQ video
didn't skip one bit
BAA BABABABABABABABA
BAA BABABABABABABABA
9it was probably that Skype took some of my bandwidth
>››››››
Hmm
9now that it's closed
9it should run much better
Some unicode doesn't end the same as I type it
Hallo
>>>>>>
››››››››
BAA BABABABABABABABA
BAA BABABABABABABABA
9how was that?
zero skipping in the HQ
Hello!:D
9please watch HQ first and then switch to LQ
NewDCD, I think ustream has a problem.
9that way we can judg-how so?
It only registers the audio
……………
School starts four days from now. I'm not sure to be happy or sad. O-o
9let me
9restart it
I DIDNT KNOW THEY HAD THAT
My ustream is still not loading.
UNICODE HAS A SHORTCUT FOR ...
I mean only has audio
9it was
9an error on my end
9it's fixed now
9gonna restart the song
wait a sec before starting
ah. ok :)
9kay Dermathil
the flipping ads gotta go off
9watch HQ first
9and then LQ
Oh, and I also got stung by a stingray! yay for me...:(
9because video broadcasting was off
do it
9so it should take more bandwidth now
(watching both)
I have ze magiks! MUAHAHAHAHAHAHA
5 secs in delay
9if that's the case, LQ is almost instantaneous
yeah
LQ is quicker than HQ
Although I am sure my favorite is definitely 
I mean
9that doesn't really matter though
9what matters is if either is skipping
No skipping nowhere
Both ended at almost 5 seconds of delay
9frabjulous day!
EEYUP
wb Kos (late)
LQ lags more than HQ for me.
9so ustream is instantaneous
9I see
LET'S UNCORK THE WINE
9Polarfire did you have both open at the same time
>mfw I actually don't drink wine
9neither do I LOL
NewDCD, I had both open.
9I don't drink period
9only if it's Smirnoff Ice
naw, I just used the /hop command
9but that's basically lemonade
HAHAHA
Same NewDCD.
9Dermathil: but you have high bandwidth
in case I pinged or something
true...
but thanks anyway :3
60Mbps
yes I did
9I just don't see the point of intoxicating myself
9with drinks that taste like SHIT
I had 2 windows side by side
HOHOHO
9okay guys
9here it is
9THE MOMENT OF TRUTH
same thing. I find alcohol to taste like shit.
9the FUCKING-TAKES-A-BUNCH-OF-RESOURCES OP
9aka my streaming benchmark since years ago
NO PROBLEM UNTIL NOW
Eureka 7 has such a heart-warming love story along with the political tones underneath
9how was that?
Smae result, HQ is considerably smoother
OH MY FKING GOD
okay floofer
NO SKIPPING AT ALL
/me floofs Kosoveon
yep no skipping in hq.
9that graininess could only be helped
9by upping the quality
9and I can't up it any more
I noticed some in LQ
KEPT THE SAME DELAY THROUGHOUT!
9scenes like those have a very high video bitrate
/me floofs back
darn, well, there wasn't any skipping though
9more than what one could encode
NewDCD, I would call this a success.
Finally getting a chance to read chapter 5 of Divergence
9so basically it's keeping yes
Graininess was not bad for me.
9I would call it a sucess
9yeah graininess is not really a problem
Both were watchable and kept in sync
9mainly because
well, "sync"
9yeah
yeah NewDCD job well done, I think that's as close as we're gonna get
9okay
9one final test
9just for lulz
9after that
9SRW Z2 test
lol
OH HECK YEAHG
9and after that going offline to get tomorrow's material
lol
you boys and your mechs :P
more cats this time dcd?
MirthTinker I know what you mean...
/me requests nyan pinkie
But I am perfectly fine with eating my π and 's.
9last test
9these are high-quality DVDRIPS
classic Gundam tiem
9BEST GANDAM
LQ is a few secs ahead even after refresh on this one.
9that can't be helped
Refresh on veemi I mean
9HQ encode takes time
9LQ is instantaneous transmission
yeah, Its a little more of a delay than last time. Just thought I would mention
9the LQ stream basically sees things with a .5 delay compared to me
9HQ on the other side: 5 secs
9as long as there's no skipping in the stream
9then everything is bright
nope :)
no skipping
9time to test this with a game, then
9but first
9got to find a way to make RJ borderless
9a second
are we going to actually watch some stuff after the tests?
I request a live reading of something
:3
Live reading of Witch of the Westmareland!
9we aren't
9I have to download the material for tomorrow
9the accident has put me behind on schedule XD
awww.... you can talk to us while you download : D
9sure thing
9would lower the quality of the stream a lot thoug
9and only stream one
9but yeah
9in any case
9give me a moment
9going offline
sure no problem. I love your voice : D
I just thought I would.... you know.... throw that out there.
"We're not talking about the dipshits over in Nebraska, this is Iowa!"
o.o
night all
/me tip toes away from the sleeping chat
night XP
shhh!
enjoy the pillow, you'll be needing it
you're gonna wake em up
you're saying that like I care :P
/me pushes Kos playfully
anyways, night~ :B
thanks for the pillow, I'm out floofer
9both are live
kk
night~
woo
/me puts sleeping cap on Kosoveon
/me curls up and sleeps
9quality in HQ should be better than ever, too
Holy shit at chapter 5 of Divergence.
9o shit Route Spilt
9*Split
/me 9goes to Akurasu Wiki
Hey DCD did that bristle guy ever rejoin the mod team? :S
9he stepped down
oh. :(
how is the search for streamers going?
fruitful?
How much did you say the streaming software you guys use costs?
its free I believe
9gonna take mid-route
9it's free
correct me if I'm wrong
9but if you wanna stream the hub/poni episodes
9you should get EasyCap
9which is like 12 bucks online I believe
Wait... I'm going to be on campus internet soon.
9that is if you don't have any other way to transfer your TV's output into the computer
I should probably not do that. Easy way to not have internet any more.
9okay guys
9uh
9gonna start
9tell me if there's any lag
9in either or
noproblem
DCD: I have a capture card sitting somewhere, but I buried it when I couldn't put the software on my old Vista box
NewDCD, you're following Simon?
9sadly no Dermathil
9the other route had too many robots I dislike
(NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO)
9that and I can't abandon TO THE MOON PUNCH
9but fret not
9this route split
9is only 3 stages
9please keep an eye in LQ as well
9http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bronystate-low-quality
9o god
9these compression artifacts look terrible
9a sec
what artifacts are ye talking aboot?
LQ audio is a bit fuzzier as well.
just noticed
NOW I MUST DISCOVER IF ALT F4 WORKS ON MAC
9ironically it looks better now
9let me try something a little...different.
/me yells, "Science!"
Hmm...it doesnt
9there
9SEMI-PERFECT QUALITY
9would be perfect if
9I found a way to.....wait give me a second
I DECLARE MACINTOSHES ARE LESS TROLL FRIENDLY THAN WINDOWS
/me finds a way for NewDCD to give himself a second. :p
Denied_Existence, press CMD-Q for ULTRA AWESOME HQ
everypony probably doesn't need to know, but due to travel i'll only be here for the lottery tomorrow night
I'm probably not going to watch the movies until Saturday, but I'll be here for the lottery.
9and thus
9DCD achieves perfect quality
9the better quality in HQ should be noticeable IMMEDIATELY
9it should look BEAUTIFUL
9SEXY
9STUNNING
9GLORIOUS
Time to pull up some inspiring music for fanfic writing

MLG AD AGAIN
Looks nice, but not enough movement to tell
9Dermathil: if the movements look slightly sluggish, it's not the stream, it's the input video
9Valkyrie attacks are like that
I said nothing like that, NewDCD.
9oh
I think you may be talking to someone else
9I thought you meant "Mild Lag Again"
9then, sweet
I got a Major League Gaming Ad on top of my chat
9oh sweet

9also can someone take a few screens of our PERFECTED STREAM and put them on the thread?
9I want to say to everyone

Ugh, I can't decide if I want to do this in 3rd person limited, or 1st person.
Any writers in the chat want to give me advice?
yeah, less blockiness now in HQ stream compared to before
/me pats

lq looks goods
03brb
lq has a bit of audio static
9that's natural
or I think its just sound
9damn it, Sprinkles hasn't appeared yet
yeah
nvm its the bass that sounds weird
9so I can't improve audio
but yeah everything is fine
9I take HQ has some static in its audio?
9it's only natural
/me 2is currently listening to songs from Skillet
I dont hear any
but that may be just because of music
2AURORA!!!! *glomps*
9yeah
hiiiiiiii
9it's probably because of htat
9...wait a second
9why haven't I tried the obvious?
wait I think I can hear it
on the right
just barely
2Aurora, I've got a question. How do I make my TST profile more transparent? It's difficult to see my background image with everything else being solid. :/
um
what do you mean
2I mean like Moonlight Lugia's profile for an example. You can see her background quite clearly with no solid colors blocking parts of the image.
you could ask her I guess
I don't really bother with the profiles
2I'll be sure to ask when I return from California in September. :)
9guys
9do you hear any static now
9that should have solved the static problem
Imma gonna go, forgot a show I wanted to watch is on
9muted audio so you could tell me
you turned the stream offline
the HQ stream that is
2Okies. :3 Have fun. ^^
lol well it solved the static problem, didn't it?
EEYUP
MISSION SUCESS
9back online
9is there any static?
9so I need to know if what you hear is silence
hearing nothing
sailence
heard beep
beep
9MISSION IS A SUCCESS!
9STATIC ELIMINATED!
silence, and a beep
lol
9AUDIO IS OPTIMIZED!
super awesome
9that means the static problem is solved
9this means that this research has been most fruitful
I see awesomeness being streamed
are you streaming tommorow?
9Rodman: in GREAT QUALITY right?
9yes, I am
Cool
9gonna have to go off soon cause I gotta get tomorrow's material
get that hq black and white moovie
alright guys and gals, see you all tomorrow.

that's all I needed to see
my day is now complete
Its heavy thinking time apparently
But seriously now, what just happened?
9so guys
9what's the veredict on both streams?

Gotta run errands tomorrow.
On my end, got to go do errands right now
So see you all on tomorrow's stream

sup ghosties
Hey
okay
9HQ is live only at the moment
9Ghosties, let's run this opening with just HQ first
9then both HQ and LQ parallel
Alright
9commencing test.
9how was that?
My broadcast was offline
9derp
9okay
9rerunning
9are you ready now?
Want me to refresh the stream?
9please and thanks
Alright
Alright, whenever you're ready
9okay
9commence operation
9okay
9how was that?
Much better
9okay then
9going to run it parallel to the LQ stream
No problems on my end
9you will just watch HQ
Okay, give me the link to LQ again
9later on, you'll watch LQ only
!cynder
NEVER WORKS
Anyway bbl
9and finally, both simultaneously
Wait, are you gonna run LQ right now in Bronystate?
9no, I'm gonna run it parallel
9HQ will be streamed here
Parallel?
9however we're testing to see if the impact on my bandwidth
9is what is causing problems
9as in both at the same time
04k
Whatever you did differently this last time worked
9okay then
Hey again
9LQ is running currently in uStream
9please keep your eye on the Veemi HQ stream at this time
Okay
9recommencing operation
Will do
LOL
It did work...once.
/me FLEES
9how was that?
Slight freeze
for like a second
9at what part?
Hi there, I just have a quick question I'm hoping someone can answer for me, I'm trying to set up my own stream for FFXIV, and I need some way to capture my desktop and speakers audio, and I figure I'd ask someone who already does it for help. What do you all use?
During the steps scene
I think
9Cobalt: give me a moment to finish my tests here
04Once upon a time
I wouldn't be able to help you, Cobalt. I'm not a tech person
9and I'll give you a crash course
But it was during the steps scene, DCD.
I think
9and will link you to the streaming guide I'm currently writing
I believe
9well that means
9it was probably just some bandwidth issue
9I just fixed it
12o-o
Of course, sorry for interrupting :x. I'll idle here while you finish your tests.
9okay, now
9see the LQ stream
9also don't worry about it, Cob
Give me the link
9http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bronystate-low-quality
Do you want me to run both streams, or just LQ?
/me sighs
9just LQ for now
9after that
9I'm gonna run a slight upgrade that should improve LQ
9without costing any more bandwidth
9kay, starting
Okay, I'm ready
ooh
whats wrong Drf? :(
03nothing really
9I take it was smooth albeit pixelated?
The sound was a little fuzzy
oh
Lol
And yeah, it was fairly smooth but pixelated
9I can imagine
9roger
But the sound was
9final test
9please run both simultaneously
just fuzzy
9I'll improve the audio a slight notch
Hold on
03http://cheezfailbooking.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/funny-facebook-fails-mum-ftw.jpg
Okay, whenever you're ready
9you should see a slightly sharper image in LQ
9is that so?
03http://cheezfailbooking.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/funny-facebook-fails-what-a-nightmare.jpg
Yeah, I could tell it sharpened slightly
Still
it's pretty pixelated
9okay
9gonna rerun them
Alright
a dream inspired me to write a pokemon fanfic
9also the delay between both is not important
(which is stalled btw)
9the LQ one should be more in sync with what I'm airing
BABABABABABABABABABABABABAB OH OH
9because it doesn't have to pass through HQ compression
9how was that?
Glacmyr woud you liek to read it?
The HQ stream froze twice
again, only for a second though
9okay
9that means one thing
9the real problem we were having was rather simple
9it was just Adobe FME fucking itself up
Hmmm... now to choose wakeup music
9it had nothing to do with bandwidth or capacity to stream
9in other words, this test has been a success
Oh, well that's good
Actually, Hoobastank sounds really good for today.
9I will slightly lower the bandwidth load
9but with this
9we've achieved perfect stream theory
So then I'm guessing you'll be able to properly address the problem I've been having?
9also, Ghosties, I think that, considering having half the speed Silverscreen has is already beating me by a mile
9and considering you can run some hefty games
hefty?
9I think you're eligible for streaming in your rig
I dunno
9well maybe I'm wording it wrong
9but I think you could run the stream
9in any case
It honestly depends...like what games?
9this operation has been successful
9I mean that if you can run games like you do
9your hardware should be up to the task of streaming
9in any case, I think I shall drop the tests here for now
9for I need to get prepared for tomorrow
9plus I need to train Cobalt here
Eh, don't be fooled. While I may be able to run some games perfectly, I can barely get a game like Doom 3 going and that's only with antialiasing off
:D
9okay Cobalt
9let's start with the basics of life
9and one of them
9is
9"Location, Location, Location"
9in other words
9do you have a Stream service in mind you'd like to use?
Well I figured since yours seemed to be working well that I'd go with Veemi.
12o-O
Cobalt, if you don't mind me asking, where did you come from?
O_o
9hold your horses, Cobalt ol' boy
9it's not so simple
9for you see
Oh, I've kind of lurked during the Brony movie nights. I think I first heard about them from Ponychan?
9there is something I learned today that's very important
whathappen?
might have been EQD. Not sure.
9Adobe FME
9 3.2
Have you been to the streams before?
9is a CPU resource hog
Brony Movie Night, that is
9in the greatest sense of the word
Only a couple times, but yes.
Alirght
9as in
*Alright
9expect it to take 30-50% of your CPU's processing power during a stream
oh, fun.
9this means a very simple thing for you
9you have three choices, I believe
9first, is to move to another stream client.
9second choice
9is to investigate if FFXIV is more CPU or GPU dependant
9and test it to see just HOW dependant of the CPU it is
I must write this down...
9the third is actually an offshoot of the second
9if your CPU isn't up to the task normally
9you should, perhaps, overclock your CPU
9if you're brave, that is
9Denied: I'm working on a streaming guide
9so you don't have to write anything down
9in any case, Cobalt
9if you don't like intermediaries
9FME is not for you
Well then that is useful
9however, if used properly
Why o_o
9FME can also give you the best quality for the lowest bandwidth
9so if your computer is up to the task
9FME can be your best bud
9in other words
9it's a two-edged sword, at this stae
9*state
That is probably a good idea for me. I already have a ton of adobe stuff on this mac and it shouldnt be a problem for me.
9there are other choices, as well, and you should consider your expected viewership numbers as well
Y U DO DIS!!!
9the easiest one to manipulate, and the one I started out with, was Livestream and its procaster
9it's stupid easy to use
9and actually hooks to gaming processes, and also has an integrated HUD in which you can see what your viewers are saying while ingame
9however it also comes with a 50-viewer limit
12with hopes you'll fall for it
9unless you can get that shit validated
12:)
9and get unlimited viewers for free as such
9good luck with that, though
I HATE procaster. It REFUSES to work with my mac here...
9uStream can also use FME for best quality
9Denied: that's because Procaster for Mac is in much earlier stagese
Well THAT might explain it.
Well, I'm not really very knowledgeable about the hardware sides of things, or technical specifications in general, but I'm very adaptable and a fast learner. I might be able to use FME. I don't think I'll be getting much in the way of viewers, however may as well prepare in case.
Woah, text
Yeah, I tend to do walls of text, sorry about that ^^;
What you thinking of streaming?
Final Fantasy XIV.
9in any case, Cobalt
9I want you to do a real quick test for me
Why do they call it FINAL Fantasy? I mean...it never actually seems to end...
Some things make no sense...
9right click
Well the original Final Fantasy was kind of a last-ditch effort, Square was going under and was going to release one final game. It just did really well, unexpectedly, haha.
K, working on it. Stupid Windows 7, moving everything around...
9then tell me if you see "Stereo Mix" among them
9just right click on the speaker icon in the taskbar, son
looking for Stereo Mix, nope.
9well
9that means you'd have to use VAC with it
9which, frankly, I don't know jack about
9I can instruct you in optimizing video
9but you'd have to speak to Sprinkles about audio
Well video is certainly a start :)
9okay then
9the question is
9will you be streaming fullscreen?
9well
9sorry
9let me rephrase that
9will your video source be fullscreen?
Well, kind of? I have 2 monitors, and I planned to stream the entirety of one of them.
9I see
9well that makes stuff easy
9give me a moment
9I must fetch a program for you
9here http://depositfiles.com/es/files/lpfyhk21n
Technically I don't believe so. I run FFXIV in windowed mode, but use a separate program to make it a borderless window which fits itself to the screen, making it appear fullscreen.
9this is the program you're going to use to capture video
9well
9.....
9wait a second
9you have a program to make windows borderless?
9I need that shit.
9you're going to see why in a moment
9for now, install VHSCRCAP
oh, sure. I think the program I use makes whatever you make borderless automatically fit itself to "fullscreen" on whatever monitor it's on. Can't drag it around.
9that's still a great program
ok, installed and launched.
9for, you see
9okay
9now
9question one
9what's your bandwidth?
uh...I feel kind of dumb here, you mean my upload/download speeds? (sorry, I know it seems that I'm probably not fit to run a stream if I don't even know this ._.;)
9yes, that's what I mean
9nah it's okay
9I also learned most of my shit on the go
yep, gotta start somewhere.
damn smilies <_<. I think I'm paying for 20/3?
12:D
9no way to be certain better than http://speedtest.net
30/5.
Another person I hate. -_-
9roger
9let's talk theoretics, then
30/5 ;_;
02I need a random animal
9since that's an online game
9and you're going to exclusively use Upload Speed for streaming
9you should probably make sure you use 1 Mbps for streaming, tops
9that is 1000 Kbps
12hai Shiny
02hi
9okay
9let's say you use
9 800 Kbps for video
9and 192 Kbps for audio
9top notch quality in both, signal-wise
12red-tailed hawk
9okay
9now
9open FME
k
9now
9select your newly installed VHScrCap
k done.
9okay
9now
9open your start menu
9hopefully
12How are you?
12:)
9tell me when you find it
found it in the newly installed files for the VH player thing.
12Hi Bree
Hmm...
12yep
opened.
9that works too
9now you should see a list
9the only item n that list should say (active) at the end
Yep.
9if there are any other items, but they do not contain (active), ignore it
9okay
9select it
Just the one shows up.
k.
02Done
02Anything else?
12hmm..
12dolphin
9roger
9now you should see three tabs
9the middle one should be settings
9go to that one
!tstposts
k.
New post:  by in ( http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic= )
9okay
03fail.
02Lol I'll try
02Anyone else want to give me an animal?
12what is this for anyway?
9now make sure only "Resize to Output Size" and "Keep Aspect" are selected
9for absolutely, ABSOLUTELY NO REASON
9use "Optimize Screen Capture"
9it will make your stream lag like a bitch
02I'm doodling
got it.
12oh
Question: it's streaming both of my monitors.
well, more of a statement actually <_<
that.
9hold on
9here comes the sweet part
9remember why I was so excited about the borderless window thing?
9okay
9go to the "Capture" tab
02Anything? Xd
9press select
9you should have a crosshair
9just hover over that window
02You guys all went quiet lol
9take note of the resolution
12you said anyone else
12lol
9click it

02And suddenly a bear came out

Well it appears to have sort of worked, when launching FME again it shows just the FFXIV window, however it's not streaming. at all. stuck on one frame.
/me draws drfbear
They're all chub :<
03LOL
9seems like perhaps it is just too big to handle

That'll be perfect
03no

02So, you a green bear?
03that sounds hideously ugly LOL

03just normal colored?
02Brown bear it is
12give him some blingbling
02With green eyes
aww, oh well.
03LOL bling
03maybe a Droid?
9you should probably
9use justin.tv
9it's simpler
9if the chat's too restrictive, do what we do and embed it
9remember, with streaming, there is always multiple options
Michigan hat
9VHScrCap should serve you well, though
Well I'm very thankful for your help ^^. Let me find the borderless window program for you, I know I have the link somewhere
I must try this someday as an operator if my interview is ever scheduled
Ah, here we go. http://www.ffxivcore.com/index.php?app=core&module=attach&section=attach&attach_id=4426
As for what I would stream I haven't decided yet.
It says FFXIV on it, but it works for any program.
it just runs in the background, have whatever program you want fullscreen and borderless selected and hit CTRL+ALT+F
comes with multiple versions of it for different resolutions.
NewDCD I am heading to sleep. I do hope y'all will get me an interview date eventually.
I wish I could have pancakes
03http://sale.images.woot.com/The_Perfect_Moment8enDetail.png

9are you here?
12that episode where fry is dating a robot copy of lucy lu
03I don't watch that show
03I've seen like 3 episodes total
It's a very simple program, so I don't think there's any way out of the borderless fullscreen unless you close the program being affected by it.
just as a heads up.
9well cobalt
9I'd suggest NOT using FME

oh god I set up FME to my browser and checked the stream so I'm streaming my stream
yo dawg...haha
I'll try other streaming services as well, but for now I think I'm going to head to bed, it's getting late. Thank you again for the help!

03that being said
03how to get island's configuration files from a FRICKING NONRESPONSIVE SERVER >:/

Yeah
03amazing
except it's an old version
03only problem I see is the IP

well
03well
03I was mainly just derping around

it should be able to connect to ocean regardless of IP

03it's been down over a week
03they owe me 1/52 of wha tI paid
03which is like $2 LOL
03yes I'm being anal about it but I'm just that mad
U AMD?
it's been down for possibly a total of nearly 3 weeks
03no, I intel
03oh
U MADOKA?
03see I told them 2 weeks
03wtf is madoka
03so yay, $6
/me hides
DCD you are the man
03about what I make by mining bitcoins every 2-3 days but I digress
http://myanimelist.net/anime/9756/Mahou_Shoujo_Madoka%E2%98%85Magica
Junh, U MEGUKA?
03OH DEAR GOD SAVE ME
/me runs
03you know though
no
03doesn't basically every anime of that type have Mahou Shoujo in its title?
Meguka is suffering
03like wasn't Lyrical Nanoha actually CALLED "Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha"? LO
03*LOL
03so by people on TST calling it Mahou Shoujo
Madoka was just a 12-ep series in 2010
Drf, that phrase means magical- yeah
03is like me calling Pokémon "anime"
i haven't watched PMMM btw
03it's not really the name of the show but just th egenre
03which for some reason Japanese people like to make explicitly celear
I call it madoka magica, as do a lot of people for that reason
03IN CASE THE COVER HAVING FOUR GIRLS ISN'T ENOUGH TO GUESS THAT IT'S ABOUT A MAGICAL GIRL, ahem
/me hides
._|
02Back
Sailor moon & Cardcaptors fall in to that genre
03when I originally asked where that kyuubey thing came from
03someone told me "Mahou Shoujo"
Madoka magica
03I was like wut
QB comes from PMMM
03so apparently people seem to think that's the actual name of the show LOL
Lyrical Nanoha is a 3? season series
Puella magi is another name for it
03yeah, uso said I might like Nanoha
a movie came out last year & they're planning more. It's a re-telling of the old series od eps
As that's the term used in the anime for that kind of magical girl
03I should watch it if I can get non-broken dub DVDs
just get E_D's rips
03except isn't Kyuubey some odd cat type thing?
03>rips
yeah
03DVDs or GTFO
YOU GTFI
*O
03k
03I have seasons 1 and 2
03but one of thsoe discs, I recall, was broken
03Drako60 ripped them for me
03from his netflix
All those discs work on my end
Its a type of fox in japan culture
03ah
03wait
03or you have other discs?
VOBs
of all
03ew
03but it's > nothing
/me is very picky about his piracy
Known for magic powers, often over fire, and is a trickster and/or ghost
03GHOST FOXES
03I mean
03hi
Think ninetales
03um
03what
03well
oh god
no
03in the anime, yes
/me dies
BTW, the R1s of MSLN are blockier than R2s so any R2 DA rip > R1 VOBs
03is R2 DA though?
03wait
03wasn't that one episode
03Ghost of Maiden's Peak
no, but i plan on is/stalled
holy fuck i hate soldering
Maidens peak no
03o_o
03well it's been a while
But yeah there is one
03but I swear there's an episode lik eit
03where they're all tricked into thinking there are humans living there?
That aside though
03but it's just an inllusion?
03*illusion
03Rating: R - 17+ (violence & profanity)
03wtf
03@ Madoka
03LOL that's an actual legend and not just an anime character?
madoka was R? O.o
Madoka has lots of violnce
03it's anime
03that's expected
03hence why I like more "kid friendly" anime like Pokémon and Sailor Moon XD
its not your typical cutie- happy-go-lucky magical girl anime l ike precure
03none of that gruesome crap
03I mean, Bleach was good
03and I need to get back to watching more Bleach
03but even then it was a bit overkill
03yeah but
03Kyuubei or w/e was based on a real 'character'?
kyuubi means nine tailslol
03oh
03I SEE WHAT THEY DID THERE then @ the anime
Trolling with unoriginality lol
But yep, that's your japanese culture lesson for the night lol
03OK
ALTAIR
ALTAIR
ALTAIR
/me thinks of the song "People are Strange"
03I mean
03hi
hi
:D
Yeah madoka was harshly dark....but I still wouldn't classify it as R imo
03you know what should be R though
9okay boys
03is a movie I watched called Perfect Blue
03anime movie
9let's play a game
03my god that was overkill
9refresh this page
03it was a good movie
9c'mon
9I dare
9you
9do it
03it's anime horror, which is something relatively rare as far as I know
9find the new feature in this page
....then again...maybe I would now that I think about it
9it's a nice feature
03but let's just say, the story revolves around a girl who was raped
03if that says anything about how messed up it is
:D
03actually not evne that
03*even
03she's an actress who plays a female character on TV who gets raped, and therefore has to film the scene like over and over LOL
03and yes, it's anime, they show the entire thing
/me dies
http://www.megaupload.com/?d=0SBCU031 < this is ep 1 of MSLN with AC3 audio
Lolwow
03story wise it's actually a really good movie
cant remember if it was R2 or not
03as it's one of those psychological horror type things
03but that definitely should be R
03if you're into messed up anime, give it a watch
/me hides
like
i usually dont like 3psychological horror type things anime
i've been working on a stereo for the past three hours
03well
my hands are shaking
03I'm into thrillers
03not HORROR mind you
i'm burnt in two places
lol
03LL is into horror, which is quite odd, girls who are into slasher movies just makes me go wtf
03but I like thriller type movies, things like Red Eye, Flightplan, Air Force One, Die Hard, etc the stuff about dealing with insane people XD
03even something like Speed would count as that really
03so to see that sort of thing done as an anime movie was truly original LOL
"Switch stream to low quality"
9so Dashite
03anyway
Perfect Blue
03yes, tha'ts the name ofh it
9are we 20% cooler yet?
03I have the DVD
031:1 bootleg I made from blockbuster
i see that DVD/BD cover occasinally here
03BD?
03Do want
We'll we are at least 10% cooler.
or was that umm, the other anime?
03well
yeah, there is one
03I'm about to pass out
03from being tired
03so goodnight

[1,0You0,4Tube]: Wheatley Puppet | by trpchakai | Length: | Views: 419 539
Well, most of then didn't know what they were doing / were giggling after poking a glass window, but more importantly, most of them haven't a clue as to what's going on in the country, they're all 'darp i'm a t33n let's be kewl and destroy stuff, yea'
They need to make a real Wheatley core
I'm sure the technology exists to make a real Wheatley
I'd also like to point out the fail that is the riot police too. they didn't do much, and whenever they actually intervened they went OTT and really hurt the people far more than tehy should have
7Except for the AI, sure.
I'm feeling tired
More likely than not, the cops simply lack experience handling riots like that
yea
I think I should go to sleep
I'm not hatin' 'em all, the goverment really derp'd.
Then again, tear gas. Dunno why it ain't used more liberally
It's sad, but the general truth (GENERAL) is that people are idiots
Same train of though here
*thought
because of this, the government has to treat them like so, and they (although perfectly reasonable and understandable if looked into) said some things they were gonna do in the future, which the people didn't get
Such as?
tuition fees, benefits, jobs
stuff
:V
it's all fine, people will still survive, but most idorts were all 'omagad gonna die! i need to revolt! now!'
I bring this up because of a ponychan UK merch thread
where two, not one, but two, said their local shops with ponies had been raided
made me ;__; and >8^( at the same time
Wat
WAT
Yeah, thats exactly what you DON'T do in a protest if you want to be taken seriously
>Uk merch AT LONG LAST. >mostly only Tescos having it >Tescos is very very popular convenience store >Tescos raided >No merch D:
Yea Rodman
they idorts : /
That's not how you send a message to the government, contrary to (F***ING) popular belief
You should see back in my country
oh?
The people who protest the most are the teachers
i still get mad at police thou, they also dunno how to handle it, either being too passive, or far too aggressive : /
Really?
There was a HUGEASS strike for one day in england with teachers
Yet, they are the ones with the most benefits when it comes to government employees
that's all, just one day where nearly all UK schools closed for one day
Yes rodman
the reason for this one day uk strike was cuz instead of loads of money after retirement they'd have some
but still
just one day of not working
and the government took action
>riot for 5/6 days
government ain't done anything yet
Minnet: die in a fire.
Okay, bye!
PEOPLE Y U NO realise
oO
ah well
Noooooooooo
Minnet come back!
I'm off for the weekend, see you guys on Sunday or something.
K
not leaving the laptop on, sorry.
OK
Minnet shall be sorely missed
Back home, every week you'd hear "Oh? Teachers on strike again?" from someone
They'd take one of the main roads between my city and the capital
12Meowing Lugia = THE END OF THE WORLD!!!!
Or maybe a government building or two
At least it isn't a riot, but then again constant strike = who teaches the kids?
Thats the thing
Public education in my country is a complete mess
: /
Out of 220 days of school, kids might get 50
waitwat
i actuallly read that as 'miss 50', then WATed, then reread 'GET 50'
Wat.
Yup
And not kidding BTW, that's actually the average
So...a lot of people in your country know ... bugger all?
Thank God for private education, otherwise I'd be stuck in a field or a factory
Indeed
: /
That sucks, man
I know
Thats been the status quo for generation after generation
You know how politics works there?
It ain't a game of "YOU COMMIE DOGS! YOU CAPITALIST PIGS!"
How (or to keep up this mini'facade' of refined language, Pray tell? XD)
Ohai everypony!
7On another random note, I had my first TF2-related dream last night. O_o
Its a game of "LOOK AT ME! I POSSESS THE BLUE FLAG!"
Hey Pegacorn
7It was one of those lucid dreams. :D
Sounds like politics : (
So yes, basically people vote for the COLOR of the party instead of the ideology
WE NEED TO PROTECT THE BRIEFCASE.
sigh, that also sucks, man : (
1, 1, 1, err...... 1!
Yeah...
INCOMIIIIIIIIING!
Pegacorn - Rodman 'n' I are having a deep discussion over governmental laws, politics, and modern education :3
lolwut
well, 'deep,' kinda
Deep stuff.Deep,DEEP,stuff.
Well, atleast I got out of there with a good educational background.
(going deeper:) DEEP Deep deep stuff
That's good to hear Rodman
So now, to get higher education and get the family out before shit hits the fan
Dunno how, but shit will hit the fan one way or another

Yup, NewDCD
ohai NewDCD
"SWITCH STREAM TO LOW QUALITY"?
dat lq hq button :3
Yes
NewDCD - is it possible to a) make the text white, rather than blue/purple, and b) center it above chat?
Ohai NewDCD.
7I found it odd that I did realize it was a dream and was disappointed yet satisfied when I had to wake up.
9a)not that I know of, but I'll look into it, and b) doing so would be more intrusive
^^ This. I agree, took me a moment to notice it. Might stick out more under the counter
I guess so
9if I manage to make it whit
The 'ITY' part just sorta pops ouside of the chat box
/me 7goes back to sprites.
like too far right, i guess
9it shouldn't need to be centered
B) True, true. But still, making it white would make it more noticeable
yea white would stand out too much perhaps
You think?
Oh well
I'm probably gunna use both HQ and LQ tonight just to see what they look like. two monitors for the win

Interesting game, though the fact that there is only ONE MAP and ONE MISSION makes it a problem

Oh really?

whereas normally I can view right here
also, I love this scene.
can't stop giggling throughout it erry time.
'does he look like a bitch' 'what?' 'DOES. HE. LOOK. LIKE. A. BITCH?'
Hello every one :)
almost over, what do after Pegacorn?
it's over
SAY "WHAT ONE MORE GODDAMN TIME.
*"WHAT"
erm... what is this channel about ? :S
uhm
as in #bronystate?
Well, here we view two movies and two episodes every friday and saturday
whats bronystate?
that'S here
saturday is a repeat of friday, but earlier for european bronies
This here's bronystate
Bronystate is also a website with the chat embedded in the side.
'This IS a tasty burger' XD
oh god
(PULP FICTION)
YUP
brony = ?
Pegacorn linked me to
brony = ?
As in, what is a Brony?
He doesn't know what a brony is.
yeah
A brony is a fan of the show My Little Pony Friendship is Magic, and also tends to be one who gets involved with the huge community online
I guess
AND YOU WILL KNOW MAH NAME IS DA LORD.WHEN I LAY MAH VENGENCE APON THEE.
a brony is an adult fan outside of the target demographic of the show.
oh gotcha Dman
The target demographic being young girls, the adult fans being ... adults
See, the show was, like nearlly all modern cartoons, to sell products
however, the team behind it did an amazing job:
unique female characters (no stereotypes really)
amazing music
great, great animation
clever storylines that don't just involve tea parties and shopping sprees
I HA RETURNED!
WHAT AIN'T NO COUNTRY I EVER HEARD OF.
/me lets Dman explain the stuff.
Way to misspell "have"
Rodman, ya get dem critters?
@Pegacorn: ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER DO YOU SPEAK IT
Ty Dermathil...i guess : D
I DARE YA.I DOUBLE DARE YA MUTHAFUCKAH.
SAY WHAT AGAIN, SAY WHAT ONE MORE GODDAMN TIME
Them critters be covered in poison and doomed to never reproduce again
as I say, we stream with around 100 - 200 people on fridays and saturdays a few less
right now, as you can see above the chat, there's still some time before some of our mods come on and begin the show
actually, the friday has in average 250 viewer
Epic
and the sathurday afternoon around 100
if ya click 'home' ya can see this week's lineup of two episodes and two movies
Dman: I am good, thanks for asking. Yourself?
Just visit the epic-chat server, after a long time. Before I use to come here daily.
You are spanish?
Yes
Excelente!
Rodman - do you speak other languages?
Spanish (native), English (second), Chinese (third)
Entonces, ¿cómo es su día hasta ahora? Dman :D

9my stars!
I'M IN THE FLIPPIN' UK AND PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THERE'S 7 BOOKS ALREADY?!?
9Dman
9you were raging so hard
9I didn't understand what you were saying LOL
that the cinema floor ..*glasses*... turned to lava
newdcd - people said they're only doing 7 movies cuz it's making money - implying they weren't aware that 7 books existed before movies
9can you translate that for me
9oh
well, you know 6 and 7 came out during, but yea
hey newdcd when are you gonna migrate to bronystate.co.cc?
SO I RAGED
back again
9....wouldn't it be 8 Movies?
trolol yea but parters i guess
9Ziltoid: we're considering inaugurating that when we actually get another domain
i raged inside ofc iddin't konw the people
9aka bronystate.com
cool
NewDCD is it true that would cost moar monies? you could set up a donation ya know?
I know some people would gladly donate
/me refreshes his emailbox
: / feelsbad dermathil
also, about to play moonbase alpha with rodman now :D
I was told that they had been looked in
feels bad pony
Is there going to be a preshow this week?
what is moonbase alpha all about?
9it's about JOHN MADDEN JOHN MADDEN
9Can't set up for donations
rbrbrbbrbrbrbrbrbbr
ziltoid - no idea, other than you're on the moon and whatever you type can be said by microsoft sam
lawl
you can walk around an area on mooon, don't even know the aim of game, lul
I know that part
9if we did, and should we be sent some sort of enforcement by the government
9they COULD prosecute our asses
9on the other hand
9while we make no profit
Wtf stupid laws
Dman, what you need to do is fix the various equipment on the moon.
o lol k. implying i will ever XD
9what they can do is basically naught, since it's just a recreational activity
9also I sent Sethisto my fic update and he said he added it to the queue
9Wednesday last week
Sethisto is a busy man
9hory shiet
NewDCD, I guess he classes them in the queue in order of importance. Maybe he forgot it too?
: /
also mfw I find out that neighbor downstairs was a wifebeater and left without telling the landlord
9http://wtfmoe.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/1297643451886.jpg
9Ziltoid
9that sucks
9I read that as "he wore a wifebeater"
never got why buy statues of animes : /
9and I was like "o...kay?"
lawl
9but then I reread
9and was "dayumn"
9also Dman: to jizz on them of course
9I KID I KID
9they make good reference
NewDCD I FUKKEN KNEW YOU SAY THAT hahahahaa made me laugh aloud so much
9and you can set them on display
Yea yea i get it now
now that i mean
9buying a huge collection of them is a huge money sink though
i mean: I didn't get it up until 2/3 years ago
now i sorta get it more and more
but DUDE Y U GO AND SAY THAT
hahahaha
and why is it so funny?
clopclopclop
9also I meant good drawing reference
Yea thought you meant that
got that
>also
9basically the same reason you'd get action figures at your age
9....and also pony toys
9pretty much
Yea
You ARE older than me ; )
I would buy ponies to support hasbro
Because I havnt given them a cent yet
also, im in spain (the land of no bronies pretty much. or brony news. WHEN U DUB? SILLY MEXICAN DUB NO PRONOUNCE 'S' RITE, WHEN U SPANISH DUB), and going to toys r us this week to see if they're there : D
see, there's actually a chance they'll have them : D
you spanish people are crazy
They also don't pronounce "y" right :P
^
and a few other things :P
NOPE
but it's not 'wrong' it's different.
your wrong
My Spanish professor was from Spain, so I actually learned Spain Spanish rather than Latin Spanish
newDCD no disrespect i actually practice talking that way sometimes, it's a new accent and i love learning accents. the accent thou i relate to all things comedy, it sounds funny to me.
I thing I find crazy is that cubans omit Ls
All of them
they hate Ls
(remembers 1 of like 5 eps he's seen from yugioh) spanish: (deep voice) QUE HA SIDO ESO??!? mexican dub: (high pitched male voice) que fue heesooo?
ziltoid u have no idea - i have a 'madrilenio' accent (madrid aka how it's taught in schools, with pronounciation of letters), but am in granada
Anyspanishspeaking bronies, do you know 'Espanol Andaluz?'
err I mean r
Rs
err I mean r

Chat gotten cold
"So give me one good reason. i should be forgiving. you, when i don't care anywaaaayyyyy~~~"
13Finally got an Espeon from DW I'm happy with overall
7Ooh, do tell.
13he's not perfect, but I've been way too picky these past couple months |D
9POS HOMBRE TIO
9ME CAGO EN LA OSTIA
My internet derped hard
Wut NewDCD
thats not nice newdcd
Lol
Is there going to be a preshow this week?
9that's
9Spain's favorite insult/expletive LOL
blahblah
9also there will be
13IVs in HP, Attack and Defence are pretty terrible, predicted 0-9 (not too bothered about these)
9but I'm finishing my download of the B-Movie
9after that gotta go to university
13Sp attack predicted to be 10-19 akak average
Ok.
9not sure whether to download Gokaiger...I think I will
Thanks
9gotta download OOO, too
13sp def and speed predicted to be 20-29 aka pretty good
Nature?
13And I was hoping for speed more than anything, so |D
13Timid
13:3
Lol
9also I just got to go to pick up some papers
9and it's really near
9shouldn't take more than 45 minutes
I love having pokemon that excell in their stats
13I guess I'm just tired of resetting the game countless times because I was being way too picky about IVs D:
9I'll be leaving in about 15 minutes
13I tell myself I don't care all that much about IVs but I guess I proved myself wrong .w.
9then back here with some SRW
My chandelure has nature that boosts sp att and lowers speed, characteristics that raise sp attack, and the spirits
Er
Species
Already have super high sp attack
9while downloading Gokaiger parallely (won't start LQ stream until those are done)
9(plus viewership should be low for the first half of the preshow
So by level 50, his sp attack was 190 lol
13Yeah, that's always the kind of thing I like to aim for :3
ok back
soz g2 read
oh ok read
also, most popular spanish insult?
oh Spain?
I don't aim for it unless its a nature that completely ruins those stats
I'd say 'joder' is
The fact that litwick was that perfect was chance lol
It's said in the youth of spain as much as they breathe almost
It's even pronounced by some as : odeh
but yea NewDCD too many people say that way too often
looses its power
it ain't strong if ya say it all the time#
9JODER is kind of a fuck-lite
9since it means...well, fornicate
9a synonym, really
So anyways
Hi :)
hahaha
fuck-lite?
brilliant, sir
13Hai to you too :P

Oh, not lies.
What is this, I don't even.
This might be awesome :O
EEYUP
THE NEXT BEST THING IN A BIG WHILE
also
http://store.steampowered.com/app/1800/
Please Valve
Still wish they'd put all their money on Episode 3.... those bastards.
Make this awesome
this thing is going to CRUSH Call of Duty and Battlefield BOTH
hey Ziltoid
I'd say Portal 3, but Portal 2 ended perfectly
my internet derped again
http://store.steampowered.com/app/1800/
look this up zil
Myeah, maybe a new coop campaign for Portal 2, that'd be nice to have.
watchu talkin but dermathil?
also this
13Is there a way to get more PC boxes in B/W?
click both links
13Because 8 isn't very much D:
...
ok
um
You filled then up already? O.o
lolwut new cc?
I certainly wouldn't mind episodes for Portal 2
GUYS GUYS
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-h3cIPabQs
I loved the coop in Portal 2, it was just so much fun
{1,0You0,4Tube}: "Counter Strike: Global Offensive Trailer" - "Coming 2012. www.steampowered.com"
13Well I've still got two and a half boxes left
13But it worries me since I can see myself doing more breeding in the future, and I have terrible luck at hatching what I want quickly |D
13I've got a nox full of Emolgas and half a box full of Deinos already
13*box
yfw I never played portal
Lol
Yeah, that'd be srsly sweet.
Deinos <3
Thought it needed more flinging.
and GO PLAY PORTAL RIGHT whenever it's convenient for you to try it out, it's a pretty good game.
Ok being serious
Move pokemon around so that there is at least one pokemon in each of those boxes
I picked portal when it was free but my computer runs it at like 15 fps
Save, restart, profit
Aw, that's too bad.
I have it on PS3, don't think my computer could handle it very well.
My computer is like 7 years old
Mine is... maybe 4? Wasn't exactly state of the art when I got it, though
13Oh wow, thanks :3
13y u so smart D:
sounds alright
it plays Amnesia pretty well, can't max out the settings but it looks good
So, how are you feeling about the new Counter-Strike?
The boxes were designed to start at 8 until they recognized that a pokemon was inside each one
I never played they original
Could make me srsly interested in online gaming again, that's how I feel.
I dont play pc games online really
because again my computer is old
Since it's coming to PS3, and that probably means SteamWorks enabled :D
Well, it is coming on X360 and PS3 and MAC too
well, obviously SW enabled on the possible platforms!
It is a Valve game!
I really hope they put in Move support... it really helps my aim a lot.
hi
Well, I don't think Microsoft allows it
hey Sotha
'sup sotha
hi sotha
RP: that's why I said possible platforms
X360 won'T have steamworks similarly to TF2
Oh, okay :P
Can we please have This Island Earth be the MST3K one?
nah
they don't want to use MST3K versions
;_;
TF2 didn't have it on PS3, though that's basically because Valve let EA handle the port.
and besides it is already downloaded
Oh sweet Celestia.
RP, that's because it was in 2007.
May the Buddha have mercy on our souls.
They made the tech for Portal 2
Ah okay, did not know that
and PS3 and X360 don'T work the same
Team Fortress 2 is a game from 2007.
Well yeah, I mean the underlying graphics interface is the biggest difference, though.
but I'm glad Sony got cozy with Valve
I'm pretty sure CS:GO is gonna push COD and Battlefield aside.
Seeing how it is the most played game ever
Not a big Battlefield fan, really.
I dont really think
on the pc for sure
but not on consoles
Ziltoid, there are more Counter-strike players than anything else.
This game has been around for 12 years now and it is still played as if it just came out.
Well I dont know I dont look at numbers
You can be sure they will include the new CS in the MLG roster.
oh yeah
Simply because there are professional teams of it.
Pretty much, though that also means the new CS is going to have to be seriously awesome to make people move over to the newer game.
oh, it will. don't worry.
RobotPinkie, when has Valve dissapointed?
Disregarding schedules, of course
Rodman: when they haven't released HL2:ep3.
also, valve-time is there for a reason.
Well, I do trust Valve, they hire the best new talent like... constantly
they care for their stuff.
Narbacular Drop - POW! Guy's hired and they make Portal
so how about dat dota2?
Coming out this winter season.
still cant believe they are ding that unveil with the 1 million dollar prinze
Who's played Narbacular Drop, btw?
so crazy
Like Gabe Newell once said: "Better for a game to be a little late than to be a game that sucks forever."
If only the Duke Nukem Forever team had listened....
In this case, "little" is relative to Valve-time
lol, yeah, we'll have to wait just a little for Episode 3, I'm guessing
DUKE NUKEM!
WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY?!?!?!?!?!
Goddammit, sandponyface now
I'm sorry for making you relive that painful memory :(
No problem
It was a sad day for mankind
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nghK9by6trw/TkRqiFNs6bI/AAAAAAAAKQk/FKNT_k-I8SI/s1600/eeeeee.png
Better?
I just put in Duke nukem: Atomic Edition, kick some ass, Duke Style, and I bleach my brain from DNF
Luna worked better
Eh, the next Duke Nukem will be awesome, it'll be from the ground up made by Gearbox
Yeah, trufax
I'll just pretend DNF never happened :P
"We'll" just pretend DNF never happened

Pegacorn.That's what it means.
In time he had considered sparing our wretched little planet of Equestria, but now, he shall make us witness, it's dismemberment!
it's like Omicron: The Nomad Soul
pretty good game, lots of bugs though
I don't think i'm gonna destroy your planet.
Anyone wanna add me to their Steam? I have no friends sadface
Megatron,though,will.
How do you dismember a planet Dashie? o:
That's good to hear i keep all my stuff there, it's so hard to find places for my stuff.
Easy. Rip a continent here, a volcano there,
Hey Ziltoid,i can add you on Steam!
Megatron doesn't want to destroy the planet. He wouldn't get any energon that way.
@Ziltoid, what games do you have?
With a hacksaw and lots of patience
not alot
my steam is Ceriousbare
Well, in order to dismember a planet, you have to remove it's limbs. See? http://tfwiki.net/w2/images2/thumb/8/83/Unicron-UltimateGuide.jpg/350px-Unicron-UltimateGuide.jpg
Ohai Unicron.
unicron is baws
Unicron was defeated by Hot Rod. So not baws...
Unicron is dangerously close to unicorn
Borderlands 2 looks interesting.
Unicron is BAWS if only for the fact that he's voiced by Orson Wells.
and indeed it does!
Who hated playing Unicron. :D

Oh gods, watching season 2 finale of Torchwood.... I am so turned on right now.
9since I lowered the bandwidth of the video feed by 100 kbps
btw valthejean. First CS game in like 7 years?
little bluryer but not like it's 240 youtube blury.
how is that cashing in?
9not really
9as I said
9bitches don't know about Counter-Strike Neo
And besides, they will show COD and Battlefield how it is really done.
9nor do they know about Counter-Strike Online
6angel
well, because instead of bringing out new content, they're just revamping older games, when Ep3 should be the ONLY game of a series that should be continued
Barry: Yes, we do learn the significance fo the cracks
let the old giants lie imo
9oh God Ranka is in his Valkyrie
ValtheJean: Oh, so if a company makes a slew of games, only a single one is worth making games?
CS had a good run
9get her out of there before she starts singing
but Deculture!
no, I'm saying I'm sick of them releasing the same things over and over again
whereas Ep3 has merit
It is like saying Nintendo should ONLY make mario games and not make any zelda, metroid and anything else
that's not what I'm saying at all
That's how it sounds like tho
Not the same people working on Ep 3 as on new CS, though...
seems a bit like it val
9>still thinking Valve will make Ep3
It's like saying they should leave mario alone because they keep whoring him to so many rediculous sports games
9>implying it won't be Half-Life 3 instead.
It's not an either/or situation
well, they said from the beginning the episodes were a trilogy
so if they change that then, well, fuck them
9>fuck them
they also said they were doing ep's so they could release the games faster =p
Valthejean, actually I heard it was very originally to be a 4-parter.
9>for giving you a better game with more content
06espeons
9that said
6everywhere
9Valve time is something I can get behind
6!Espeon
/me now belongs to Aurora for 20 minutes
9they take forever, yes
6 20minute get
9but that's because they don't want to release a shoddy product
they didn'T put a trailer in Episode 2 because they didn't want people to react like they did to the differences between the trailer in Ep 1 and what Ep 2 actually looked like
meh, I'd much rather have a shorter episode for much less cash
HL2 episode 3 will be something like a full game, but I doubt it'll be HL3
9they actually take the effort to make a good game, so yeah
13rarrr
Valve time, takeing soon™ up to eleven.
and then have HL3 (in the event such a thing existed) be just like HL2 was to HL
in that it's the same universe, but VERY different story arc
6http://i51.tinypic.com/2s96syr.jpg
9I'd rather wait forever for an amazing game than little time for just a good one
6I particularly like chaotic neutral here
That's what being employed by the G-man means
you're used where you're gonna be useful
well see DCD, I'm fine with the wait and whatnot
but they keep making so much OTHER shit
9they're different departments
it may not be true, but it gives the impression they just keep pushing it back
from what I've seen they're taking the better parts of both CSS and CS1.6
13LOL I like that
(1.6 bullet perforation, for example)
9Source doesn't have shootan through wallsan?
It was different
not the same
hay dose not offer as muchprotection as say a car.
9how is the stream right now?
9currently downloading another file
Also, new weapons.
stream's good
good
I even hear they could be adding Aiming Down sight.
but also compare the release dates with episodes 1 and 2
2006 to 2007
we're now in 2011
Aurora you enjoy my company
lol
9that might be interesting
BTW
Valthejean
She just STARES
9as long as they haven't cancelled Episode 3
9everything is bright
9Valve ain't Crapcom
eh
it's the new dukenukem =p
people said the same thing about Duke Nukem Forever
they said the delay between Ep 2 and ep 3 would be longer than the delay between Hl2 and Ep 2 I think.
Episode 3 is the final episode, I really do hope they work on it a lot longer.
that's really old news
6lol
yes, but even if it's supposed to be longer
It's probably going to be the size of a full game
there comes a time when it's just TOO long
i still wanted duke nukem forever to come on a floppy disc just to make peeps rege
I mean, don't get me wrong
I REALLY want ep3 to be everything we expect
I think that times is when the new things they come up for making the geame is outdated.
who's the designated streamer today?
but the longer they take, the more at risk they are of repeated DN's mistake
9KIRABOSHI~
ok god is she gonna sing?
Valthejean, don't say Ep3 is gonna be like DNF. DNF was made like that on purpose. That was a DESIGN decision.
'sup gummy
that's bs
eyy
sorry, that's complete bs
no it isn't.
it's an excuse for their shoddy work
So you say it isn't their fault?
And it isn't an excuse.
what?
DNF was caught in development hell for 10 years, very little development was done on it during most of the "development" time
I'm saying that they failed miserably, and are just pretending they wanted it to be like that
To say they CHOSE to make it as shitty as it is is WAY worse than saying it was merely an accident.
/me 9cackles manically
9GANDAMU DABURUU EKKUSU, FURRU POWAA
12whee taking my drivers test monday
lol
well they can SAY whatever they want, it doesn't change the fact that they fucked up
yeah
I see what units you prefer.
also, nice upgrades DCD :P
6wheee :D
And to say they chose to make it like that means they decided to make it a fuck-up. alright? To say you wanted to make it a fuck-up is worse than saying you didn't want to.
i just read the whole cupcakes story today, last time i just skimmed it
didn't even know about apple bloom
Good luck!
Shame squaresoft never let them use the xenogears in any of these.
I don't know if its the same there Umbreon, but drive like an 80 year old woman and you'll be fine!
I like the gundams >.<

Torchwood would be somewhat cooler if it had ponies in it, though.
6oh nevermind
20% cooler to be precise
6forgot practice requires unlocking
63.7% cooler, actually
120% cooler, I think
I would think by now it's been proven everything is better with ponys in it.
I mean there are six awesome ponies
