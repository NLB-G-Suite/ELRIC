But yeah.
Don't think he cared for the epilogue either.
I do remember him saying that chapter 11 torpedo'd it in his personal ranking from around 3rd favourite right out of his top 10.
and he did it perfectly
Didn't it piss off a lot of the people in the comments?
but a lot of people probably can't appreciate it unless they have lived through a similar sacrifice, or at least know the emotion

9We're watching this show on Saturday
9so I don't want to spoil it
Why do I think this intro has got nothing on either TTGL or Dai-Guard?
9I take it looked great?
It looks good for a 1996 anime I guess
9I meant the stream's quality I mean
I know
but I ain't got no reference for 1996 animes
Oh.
Didn't you stream a couple episodes of this ages ago?

9go get it
9it's necessary
9I'm going to give you the details via Skype before writing the guide
9Rodman, we've also inaugurated a low-quality stream
Oh really now?
9see for yourself http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=BronyStateLowQuality
9they're sister series
9it's only natural
Although, any particular reason for the low-quality stream?
9both made by Shotaro Ishinomori
Okay, clothes are in dryer, except kilt which is hanging to dry, dryer duct is attached. Now to put shit on chargers and call it a night.
9Rodman: we've recieved several reports from people complaining the stream lags for them
03!pokemon

14what is that
well
14oh fun, and they're-- okay
14I was going to say trolls
they're pretty much /b/tards on 4chan
yes they are trolls
14looks like that fits the bills
...some of them at least
6although
6I must say
03LOL
03I generally agree with most of those DDOS attacks
14LOL
03those guys were amazing
6ok well
6I don't know
At least they weren't too evil, oh wait
:o
6but I still don't approve
there's no such thing as evil :p
14I'm just saying
well
because fb needs to gdiaf
6the only thngs I'll approve of are attacks such as the one on westboro
>|
03and put lots of pictures on
03:)
6they DESERVE all the crap they get
6and then some
drf, I'd only do one to kill fb xD
03well
westboro?
03Sony deserves all the attacks they gbot :P
03*go0t
03*GOT
6especially since I've been picketed by westboro and watched it in person
6it was hilarious
6Ascendant, you havent heard of westboro?
apple as well
14of the hack?
Really LOL
14yes
Because they have Kinect? :P
03no
6lol
14oh
I know
03because they actually stand behind their products
I'm not talking about gaming though :p
03and don't try to brick you if you hack
03*cough*3DS*cough*&
lol 3DS
But at least MS doesn't kill you
Yeah
3DS is fiine
:P
03no
If you're me that is
/me flees
MS tries to make you a prostitute though
it's that bad
03I mean
well, their prostitute
03but it's just like politics
14now way
14*no
03stand behind the least bad
I'm sure people would be more willing if it was "holy"
12for nao'
12:P
then they'd claim they had had "it" with "god"
perhaps
lol
03Sony is not getting any less Evil
03so...
I still don't like MS though
12yum

14wait, is no one going to explain westboro?
6may
Good!
:P
or you're a hypocrite
6you dont know westboro either?
and therefore
14no
Aren't we all
:p
6ok
6THAT
6is a story
6worth telling
14okay
14I'll sit and listen then
6basically
12O.O
12Danny
May I listen too :o
12that
12was just
they are a hate group that uses religion to justify their protests against gays and such
12._.
@may
and require MONEY
6they're the most extreme religion in the country, as far as I'm concerned
14waitwait
:o
14like westboro baptist church?
yes
6they picket soldier's funerals, they picketed us at fanime for "going against god's intentions by having a prostitute/rape/devil's party), and I'll link you to the rest
Awesome story Rora o.o
14ew
Poor Anime con
14cult much?
:<
6and the parents didn't even think twice about it when they banished their daughter
6Ascendant, that's westboro
6as well
that's hillsong
>|
same, FF
12yah
03I mean
12but images
12x.x
03it's one of the 3 unforgivable curses of the tech world
/me runs
12lolz
lol
12yes
12the f word IS an unforgivable curse
just open it
6http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=6774.0
/me hides
remove tracking devices
and etc.
03and they aren't going to stop doing that unless they get sued
03Ascendant
6read the link for westboro topic
03no
LOL
There is none
It's all software bsed
03you can prevent them from spying by disabling wireless
FIRMWARE OF DOOM
03so it's a catch 22 LOL
03^
Yeah
12Danny
12open the eshop
03Ascendant
There is no way :P
12the message arrived
Not yet that is
03:O
03I'll do that when I get upstairs then
12the GAMES arent there yet
Aww
12thats Sept 1
I got that one too
12but
03They haven't even made custom firmware for the DSi yet
03heck
12make sure to oepn the eshop b4 tomorrow
Not even for the DSWii?
Limited hardware
03It prolly won't happen
03now
12Hyper
03speaking of that
12the message for the 20 free games
12:3
Oh
03basically
12and the 10 for GBA
Put personal data out?
12AREN'T going to be released ;3
03no
Not exactly o.o
hahaha
03Let's put it this way
12outside of us
12:3
12also
12night all
03LL D:
D:
seeya
12what?
:(
03didn't get to say bye properly LOL
03did you hear me say bye on XBL?
12I need to wake up earlyish o-x
12no o.o
03:(
LOL
Fail much ;<
03:/
12kay~
Aww
Cute
Of course, I <3 Living Color
03maybe send me a few pix
03to look at
03before it
/me runs
12good luck :3
03nah JK
03I have some :P
03anyway
03HML
03let's put it this way
Oh
03now
03originally
03well, starting with the DSi
03Nintendo put a stop to that
03basically, there's a common key
03that all games have
03but it's encrypted
03something like 10^32 combinations are possible
03that basically, all DS games that exist have this key stored in them
03but that's still an incredibly temporary solution
03so
03Wii has a common key too
03as does 3DS and just about any console in existance
Or at least why some cards have games on them
03now
03here's the thing
:o
03with 10^32 combinations
03brute-forcing it would take about 15 millennia
I'll try it now.
03even with a supercomputer
03but
9yosh!
03imagine if everyone in the world tried all at once
9I'll check both streams in fullscreen
9and give you my opinion
03sounds good in theory, right?
Yeah O.o
03well
Evil processing power there
03such a software exists
9naw
03or it did, a couple years ago
03well
9if you got 1 Mbps of Upload speed
9it shouldn't
03as did lots of other people
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
03never found the key
9but wait
03nobody did
9Dari
03SUPPOSEDLY
9why do I still see border?
?
9I still see border here
03but then all of the sudden, the program just disappeared, all the download links were removed, etc, all threads relating to it were locked
I dunno.
How odd O.o
9also there seems to be some skipping
Not really
03hence my rant against evil hacking communitqies
03someone DID find the key, they just didn't know it
03the group that made the software took the key
9try selecting it as I told you before
03profit
I did?
9just click the window when you're selecting with VHScrCap
All 3 are really good
03so, evil hacking communities :/
03basi
03basically, if someone were to figure out the common key
03they could do anything the ywanted, literally, on a DSi/3DS/whatever
yeah ff
03write custom firmware
9huh
9wait
Awesome o.o
9then it's not a border
03etc
9it's probably a player issue
03because
03Nintendo cannot physically change the common key
03it's existed as long sa the DS has
Haha
9try switching to another renderer
03there'd really be no way to ever stop it
03:)
Evil hacking :P
03yeah
9we see a bit of a border on the left and bottom
9except it's not really a border
03so now I mine bitcoins instead
/me runs
9but rather a sort of "tear"...hard to explain
03XD
03see
03I had a theory too
if something like that could happen
03which... I actually need to mention to someone
6lulzsec, get on it
03basically
;p
03basically this way
03whether it's encrypted or not
I can see it on the preview.
03so my idea is
03take every DS ROM you can find
9hmmm....
03see what's common between all the files.
9probably due to
Check for parts that match :O
03Do that, you;'ll find the key
03Right? XD
9the renderer?
2 FMEs is using up all my RAM anyway.
9try closing VHScrcap
03but I might be over-simplifying this, as I don't think it would work
03dude
9and clicking on them
03if they can convince literally thousands of people to run a program to try to find the key
9derp I mean
9close VH Scrcap
9and reopen it
Yeah XD
03they have like 20 thousand members or something
But they should start with the smallest ROM first :P
Nice o.o
Are they all evil hackers
9yeah
03no, but the forum is devoted to Wii/DS/3DS hacking XD
9the LQ stream doesn't have that problem
9theeeeeeeeere we go
9nice and ready
03DUDE
03http://gbatemp.net/
03Look at top news story
03Windows Based Application
HAHAHA
Input seems to be lagging for me.
03:D
Ironic/timing
I've got 2.5GB RAM.
03NOW SOMEONE FIND THE PROPER KEY ALREADY DANG IT LOL
9I only got 1.8GB
9 2 if you round it up
inb4 someone cheats using saves and that key?
Well I'm at 100% CPU usage.
I do
9oh
(Violet and white)
I WANT FULL VGA 3D PICS ;.;
03LOL
9is anyone else getting skipping?
03VGA is not going to happen
i've done it on my DS :P
03not 480
03er wait
03is it even that many? It might be 240 still :/
Maybe we can like...crush the pic down :p
No
9yeah
240 "|
033DS has really terrible specs
03That being said
Crappy res
03it works
Sadly
Night
9probably because of that
03but I was majorly disappoint when I read about it
9night Nittany
Hmm.
03but 3D aren't
03yeah
Unless I was seeing thing
Yeah
03nope
03even the DSi does VGA res
03granted that's still horrible
Or for webcams
03dude
03webcams now do like 6 megapixels
HD webcams
xD
Other than IRC, yeah.
I know
03^
03even this crappy laptop webcam does 2MP
I've got AVast! running.
1.3MP is fine enough for me :P
03yeah
03well
03VGA is 0.3MB
03*MP
03if even that
03@calc 640x480
= 640
anyway, sleep for reals
03...
03oh
03@calc 640*480
= 307200
9the quality looks good, but the skipping is bad
Bye.
03yeah, 0.307 megapixels
12@calc 9
= 9
Yeah, the input on the preview is skipping.
9so yeah, dari, it's probably too high a CPU load
12it figured out that 9 = 0
03rofl
129*
03NEW NDS Homebrew
03SHEEP GOING TO THE LEFT
/me hides
I hope the Wii U has a decent
9what CPU are you running?
*BIRDS
XD
03LOL
03the sad thing is that most DS homebrew sucks
9not sure if this might help, but
03unlike Wii homebrew which is generally awesome
Exactly
Wii homebrew <3
03we need to get some good DS homebrew devs
WW2
03HAHAHAHAHAHA
03Accio Hacks
9but still present
03Harry Potter FTW?
I only use GeckOS
9hey Pinkie
2.80 GHz CPU 2.5 GB RAM
9I'm running 3.2 GHz
03LOL, they changed their slogan to "underground gam7ing community"
9albeit the model of the CPU is more important
03-7
03Nintendo prolly got pissed
Yeah
03I need to start going to their forums on a regular basis again
;.;
03We have 265,001 registered members
03265 thousand members
03of gbatemp
Nicee
03also
032744 user(s) active in the past 30 minutes
03imagine if TST forum was that active
03we'\d need like 40 mods
How many mods to they have?
03not sure
03hm
03there are only two administrators of gbatemp
9dari, this might help http://majorgeeks.com/download.php?det=5952
03let me check global mods
Over 900 admins
Hrm
036 o.o
mind pausing the episode if you stop watching it?
o.o
03and then 6 non-global mods
03I know
03ratio wise that's HORRIBLE
we can't see nothing
03Those guys must be insanely busy XD
03-\
I'm surprised that place is still decent :p
9yeah, Dari, it follows the window's location, not when it's blocked
03yeah
03oh trust me
Think of all the noobs there XD
03there's a fair share of trolls
03wel
03*well
03see
03that's the nice thing about the Wii and DS hacking threads
03noobs wouldn't even know what's going on
9aside from the skipping, that looks really damn good, Dari
I'm using a program to keep it on top.
Only teens/adults would use it?
JACK HARKNESS
Or geeks that is :P
03but I dont'even bother with those XD
Same
03*the
I don't even have a Wii anymore
HOT
As the Wii U and hacking is near impossible now
03hm
03there are 5 "supervisors"
9PEDOING A LEGAL BABE
03yeah, luckily my Wii still works, my modchipped one XD
My Wii was stolen
9is anyone else getting any skipping?
03:(
Along with my Dsi z.z
DSi XL that is :P
no more skipping here
03it reminds me o;f my friend usotsuki
03someone broke in and stole his modem and his girlfriend's t-shirt
03and that's all
Some skipping, but not that bad
9I'm getting some slight skipping
6...
03they left all the computers, TVs, gaming consoles etc there
JACK SAVES THE DAY
03I was like, WTF?
6thats ridiculous
9like Pinkie
03who steals a modem
Fail much
03that being said he lives in a trailer at the moment
03well
6I'd be on about the shirt, modems are understandable LOL
03...
03uso has like four computers
Definitely watchable, still.
03why would they not jack one while they're stealing the modem
03XD
Wat
9yeah
DAT PAUSE
9but you know how I am
9OCD with streams
Insanely stupid theifs
03granted I'm not saying that would have been gooed
03but everyone on #P-O was like WTF
6no see, you could at least sell a modem or something
And I only have three PCs in this house :<
6the shirt.......I still dont understand
6but yeah
Me neither
Shirts
9video quality is great though
Why
6why not grab computers lo
03*thieves
/me hides
03maybe it was a pair of jeans, not a shirt
03either way it was just one single clothing item
6even then though
9anyways, dari, I think I'll have to continue this tomorrow.
6CLOTHES
6WHY
03^
Ok then.
9sure thing

CPU usage is abnormally high for some reason.
It's not normally this high.
The player is using 30-40% O_o

HOOOOOO!
12Hope it goes away soon :<
/me does a flip
hmm, umm, does this count?

12turns out i should have stuck with my instinct XD
12Ah
and this also.
/me pulls off shirt, revealing a bikini
12as much as i hate to say it
12True

12actually they are awfully close
mmmm.....
12Ah, that's good
12XD
12well
12this filter confuses me
/me requests more mood music, if, you know, that's alright with you...
12i look at the filter and it says it's supposed to capture really fine particles in the air
12but i can easily see right through it
12XD
12Dunno
o.0
12i see metal tabs on the filters
12maybe an electrical current runs through the filter and magnetizes it
hehe. Since I only have, you know, two customers I can. umm tailor more to their individual needs....
12That actually would make since
12since~~~~
12Some filters are all metal
cusomers!?
12this is like plastic though
now now boys, we've got to take turns now.
/me leans in close, and plants another kiss on dari's lips
12i remember getting the filter because it said the filters were washable and reusable
/me moans.
Mmm, you taste good. ;2,15)
12then a week or two afterwards XD
/me checks his wallet...empty
/me sits down in his lap, wrapping her arms around hos shoulders
12XD
12the neighbors through out a couple of those bionic air filters
12that used to be advertised on tv
12*threw
12ionic sorry
12well
12i used them for awhile and they seemed to work
12because you are trading one pollutant for another
/me breaks the kiss and runs her hands accross his chest
mmhmm, does that feel good?
12That's not good lol
Ohh, yeah.
12but it's still there
/me runs her hands under dari's shirt, easing it upward over his head
12brb shower
12at this time?
12Yep |D
/me leans in close, pushing her chest up against dari
12ok
/me puts his arms around Sluttershy, resting them on her rear
/me squeezes
12I have somewhat of a headache,
mmmmmm.......
/me reaches down and fishes for the button on dari's pants
Go on then, naughty girl. :P
mmm ;)
/me pulls out the camcorder now
/me unlatches the button, and pulls dari's pants all the way off
/me runs a hand starting at dari's ankle, slowly pulling it all the way up to his inner thigh
/me notices the *ahem* problem in dari's groin
Is that a present for me, dari?
;)
You going to unwrap it?
(;
/me pulls down dari's boxers
/me 's eyes light up
hehehe
/me leans down quickly, taking the entirety of dari's cock into her mouth
/me gasps.
>stream
/me grins, and begins to move up and down
/me puts his hands on the back of Sluttershy's head
Just like that.
/me reaches up and wraps one hand around the base of dari's cock, leaving the other free to caress his lower stomach
/me moans and closes her eyes
/me begins to move her head faster

hey Winter
Hi guys
hey winter-puff
and barry
ya i heard bout that somthing to do with not getting paid and other shit
wait actually it was a 15K$ surgery
brb
(it was a Rockethub fundraiser)
This is a legal affair between lawyers now
the goal was 15K$
just, check this page. http://www.rockethub.com/projects/2165-extra-credits/posts/740
I dont go on gaming websites anymore
Because I dont have enough money for games
:(
don't worry.
They've got a section about movies and anime and everything too..
I cant remember the last time I went to a theater
I think it was Avatar lol
eh
The movie theater's lobby was FULL
Haven't seen anything like that since Avatar, actually
not really
I heard it is very good
hes not all that speacial
well I mean
exactly
hmmmm
really?
yeah
thats crazy
well, there's that and the fact that I'm a sucker for all the marvel movies.
whats next before avengers?
or is that it?
I think it'll be the Avengers.
Though I already heard of a Thor 2 in the way
after Avengers
not yet
Me neither
just some basic software and acess to the veemi server
I would guess
and a good upload rate
Hm
Hai guys

Just have to wait and see, I have seen some of their past videos and enjoyed them.
the idea they've thrown in there about how to do it is really good.
alrighty
Could be interesting
ARE being used for the End of Nations MMORTS
I know, I'm just excited for that one
Nice
But as I was saying
I REALLY want to see how that works when it comes out
uses.
You give xp to the units, and the stronger they get the higher their cost becomes.
(that's the mmo part of their suggestion)
<---- *long-time C&C fan*

Awwww
OH WELL
Dammit somebody need to stream something

Good point
Welcome back Nick and hi everyone
Heya Sky :3
10:3
:2
03:3
Played Dawn of War then?
Got DOW2
Got a cousin with the 1st one
(I got every expansion for DOW2)
I get you RP.
Yippee, pointage!
ON THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA BEEEEEEEEEEEYATCH!!!
I should play more FPS games online, though. I don't mind getting a 1:1 kill ratio when it's fast paced and fun. :P
nice.
Hallo
Hello there Barry
over 50 kills and only 4 or 5 deaths
(I think it was only 4 deaths)
That's pretty good
yeah
http://lhcathome.web.cern.ch/LHCathome/Physics/ < LOL
and by "pretty" I mean "really"
Makes you need to take the 3rd dimension when looking for enemies
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JRkogAL3Uo
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shattered_Horizon
Yeah I just checked out that trailer, looks like it'd be fun to watch people play
That is just freaking amazing (for me)
the shooter where I got my kick-ass kdr
Looks pretty cool
yeah
Oh man
Well I can play SOME games...
Oooh, I like 3D dogfighting games
Hiya
lol oh wait, I have Lair
I'm baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack!
Hallo, Pegacron
hey pegacron
/me turns into Pegacron
Well, he is, according to.... something or other.
everybody called him like that.
I was considering saying Pegacorm, instead.
......I must do something that only my Transformer form can do!
/me punches through a building
Ooooooo,a FPS!
yeah
I died four times.
Over 50 kills.
"To the Last Man"
it's season 2
Wow Dermathil,you're pretty good at that FPS!Because,of course,not everypony can get a KDR of 14-1.
yeah
Not always that good.
(I'm mostly a FPS player. When I play TF2 sniper, I do pretty well when I can get a footing and pick up some steam)
yeah
I do get my moments.
Usually when I get my moments, it's on PSN and the other people disconnect....
but I really shine as sniper.
BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM
Sometimes I've had people rage at me. I've even been accused of hacking once.
he said I was aimbotting.
lol people are like that. If you're too good at head shots, you're using aimbots
yeah
I only have about 100 hours in sniper though.
Even in games where you can't aimbot. Go figure.
yeah
Me,but later since i have to go.
don't worry.
Don't have TF2... or well I have it on PS3
completely free
Can't play it, I don't think :/
why?
computer too weak?
(it was a 2007 game)
gtg
later Pegacron
okay.
I'm slightly familiar with ubuntu.
do I hear a dari waking up?
still, kind of a hassle to install, I might do it later
(not using it now though.)
I'm on Ubuntu
yeah
lol that's pretty awesome
yeah
I guess...

lemme refresh
wait...>is now confuzzled
?
O_o
Same here
you trollin me dari?
Wow.
Nah
ya dari you are streaming a coments section
It's probably because I left the stream on all night.
oh haha
well, I DO have a pretty behind, thanks
Lawl
That's weird.
no idea
Hours.
XD
might need to restart it
Won't help.
see now we should pretend that we're actually watching something
oh, okay
he'll just be like... "the fuck?"
haha, that would be pretty awesome
awwwwww
Hmm
killjoy!
with ponies up next
Wut, no sound?
12:47 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMja6Cdq-1M
well, it's not playing anything
DEM EYES
it's the thing you see at the end
with the recommended vids
Icons like that would be amazing rofl
oh, cool
pony slip?
we were chilling at his apartment, and he asked if I wanted to go wander around for a bit (we do that a lot)
and I'm all: "Okie dokie loki"
after a brief pause
easier link: http://youtu.be/MMja6Cdq-1M?t=12m42s
Yeah, but he wouldn't get the reference?
lol
6courage <3
yeah, but rather than explain it I just let it go
I always say "Eeyup" now. xD
haha, I'll do that on occasion :P
lol, I *wish* I had pony tats
I'd only ever get a pony tatto if I got a tatto.
tattoo*
well we haven't yet seen Season 2...
I'd kill for an icon I could have on FA like that XD
But I'm never getting one. :P
...though I have high hopes
*que something I'd post on /pony/ as a long rant*
I mean, even if the show dies
lol
alright back
back from TF2
the fact that we watch ponies has little meaning honestly
it just happened to be my exposure to said community
which is why I hate the "ponychan is dying" threads
Ponychan ain't dying.
Ponychan is kind of meh.
Too much drama.
dari, you seen fimchan? its even worse.
lol, normally I'd argue against that dari
I'm starting to agree >.<
oh god...not sure if I should get into it now that it's deleted
oh it's that bad?
basically brought up a lot of the !!Spike drama again
Spike drama?
Forums > imageboards
:P
fair enough
I agree with dari on this one.
but I haven't really found a pony forum I enjoy
Well, are there any good pony forums?
still haven't fixed the stream thing dari?
6lol
Might just be because I'm streaming high quality, it was fine for people last night.
maybe
the thought amuses me
it might also just be my connection
well, its lagging slightly for me too
We have the last 2 episodes left.
In series 1.
okay
offline
Yeah.
Changine settings.
Changing*
Let me restart FME.
Ok, back up.
hurray!
Haha, no problem. :)
Ahh.

Minnet: be against anything pony.
9I need reports on skipping
/me is against anything pony.
no skipping on my part
no skipping
9gonna run this opening a few times more
Minnet: be also a stupid pile of code
9please check both HQ and LQ
Whut
7this is HQ?

9I see
9give me a moment
Good
I've burned through WAY too many cards because of improper overclocking
I'll be back in 15mins, off to make me some tea and food. Stomach's growling.

9I figured
9I believe I know why.

!digimon
9status report?
but HQ looks fine
6!digimon
/me 6to the digiwiki
9set different processors to do each stream
9restarting operations!
interesting idea
9report?
hmmm
this is where I'm slightly uncertain
it's certainly IMPROVED in LQ
oh
wow nm
there goes the spikes
9roger
at first it was alright, but now it's exploding on itself
9going to attempt something, restarting stream
06!pokemon
Espeon, you are a 12Snover.
/me 6chops down an espeon for the living room
9streams are live
even though I'm taking leave tomorrow
6I read that as 12:15
interesting
9I think there might be some slight.....okay not slight
9there's skipping on my end
yeah
12Same XD
what's interesting
9let me try something else
9that's simple, really
at first, the studdering is nearly impossible to see
9I set priority to both at high
12Sometimes I'
12XD
9we're live again
you're my favorite customer
7it's lagging
yeah, HQ got heavily delayed
9made some changes
Myeah, just at the start though
interesting
LQ breaks at the exact same place every time
that group shot
is always when it just implodes on itself
I'm curious if it's just related to being a LQ strem
stream*
if it's possible
can you try setting the priority of the LQ higher than HQ?
or even run the LQ without the HQ running
9 let's try setting the priority on one above the other first
kk
9time to start
7skipping
9in HQ, or LQ?
9or both?
7LQ kept playing
alright, at least we know it isn't a stream issue then
I'm only getting the stutters in HQ
broke at the same place again
9gonna run LQ only
9and then HQ only
kk
9LQ is live
interesting
I'm getting studders on my end
9so did
9I
9let's try running HQ only
much smoother
wait a second
it's after the group shot when problems show up
12!Pokemon
okay yeah it's good
12:3
9Sathi: can't be helped
9video's bitrate for that scene is unusually high
9let's try something else
9LQ only, FME open only for LQ
is it up?
9LQ is live
same place
9then I have a theory
hm.. now to commence the initial handling of the extra database.
stuttering on both I'm getting
9let's try something simple then
9okay
9both are live
yeah, still stutters on both
9ffffffffffffffffff-
though HQ seems to be fine now
just was bad at the beginning
spoke too soon
lol
9I paused though
9still
9let me check somethign out
9brb
I saw that
lol
.....I GO!
*FF Music*
aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh
dat static!
KILL IT
on it
7dat many popups
whew...there we go
7brb reloading...
ba ba ba ba
and back
how is it?
well LQ definitely stutters
its good
on hq
static on hq tough
I'm not certain if it's just the anime (half animation), or just REALLY subtle stutters
LQ stutters
HQ is smooth
back to square one, eh
see, I'm not getting the same thing
I mean, it's not NEARLY as bad as LQ
let's try
suddenly voice
something completely different
skippity skip
trying something
guys
according to the net
brb
kk
stream offline?
DCD's installing a different FME version
2.5, installing

9did the FPS improve when I lowered the quality at LQ?
it's paused rite now..i think
9it is
9gonna run it again
9I "balanced" the quality
now LQ is about 15 seconds ahead
for me
i'll try refreshing
9what you saw just a few seconds ago
refresh both
ofc
9how are both running?
>_< stupid ad

9sakusen kaiishi!
12my friend wanted to come over today
12-.-
dat add
LQ seems to still be a little ahead of HQ
HQ being here of course
9yeah
9because HQ has to be encoded longer
its really choppy
9really?
9then uStream it is
whereas bfore HQ was, as other said, ultra smooth
9in uStream again
9do you guys need link?
i gots mine
9roger
9sakusen kaiishi
BAA BABABABABABABAB
BAA BABABABABABABAB
9pretty much
9using a browser streaming service is much less resource-consuming than two instances of FME
HQ still HQ here
but none of two LQ pages for me have vid right now?
9>forgot to press start broadcast on LQ
9....DERP.
9okay sakusen kaiishi fo reals this time
...yup LQ XD
paused too :P
aaand playin
9tell me how both of them run
BAA BABABABABABABAB
BAA BABABABABABABAB
HQ is stil HQ
LQ is actually quite good
9Mission Complete, then
for some reason, again, LQ is ahead by about 4 or 5 seconds
9both are smooth?
...yea
9it should be ahead by 2.5 seconds
9it's only natural
cuz of HQ taking longer to rendar?
9I tested the encoding speed of FME
or something
nah
alright
9the reason LQ is ahead a bit
great
9is because it's taken directly from the Capture Device
cuz takes less time to make, cuz is lq?
oh ok
/me 9knows his shit
9well
nice
9I think this mission was a success, Gentlemen
9okay

9it should be
In fact, R63 - i'll fund it :D
9 5 second in HQ and 2.5 seconds tops in LQ
9as in with the delay, I mean
it was lesbian R63, Dman

9perhaps if we restart them
9that was on my end
9don't worry
the delay?
9the lack of audio
Oh, that wasn't the problem
The problem is just that the whole thing is about an entire intro's length of delay

9let me try lowering the bandwidth a bit, then.
Dman, i would care. i would care
and LQ just finished
lol k
9we're live
9I think I should have Sathi gauge the delay
9okay
wait for some time
9gonna press play
HQ still freezes once in a while
delay is about 10 seconds now
9what do you mean with freeze?
9skipping?

well it wasn't bad, no
although I realised I had the appendices and ended up reading the section on languages and writing systems instead
Ahaha
With the weather having turned, I think I might even go out on the deck to work on it for a bit.
ack dunno how to feeneesh it
it uh
has um...
(It's been freaking rainy lately)
Wut?
how to feeneesh eet
And that rain came on the heels of brutal heat
I actually haven't read LotR, only had a marathon of it one weekend
The movies, that is
standard or extended editions?
i deed eet
it's a little explicit in 2 or 3 parts, but hey!
I'm pretty sure it was standard but I couldn't tell you
did you read the meetthescout transcript?
Yes.
i saw M1, and it wasn't that great imo
I got through the first 100 pages, and when nothing happened I put it down
I read the novel years and years ago, but I think I only managed to wade through it by my determination to impress my peers and didn't properly appreciate it.
(why can't you tell me? you wouldn't have to kill me if you did, would you?)
HNNNNNNNNNNNNNG
(n.b. I read the introduction to TLotR and apparently it's "one novel in multiple books")
I feel as if my brain just died
and is now oozing out of my ears
...
hahaha
one novel in multiple books?
yes
lol, I'm sure
d/w
you think?
I HAVE IT in my hands
Well actually

"The Lord of the Rings is often erroneously called a trilogy, when it is in fact a single novel, consisting of six books plus appendices, sometimes published in three volumes"

DAMN.
GET OVER HERE!
you have a 3DS luna?
/me tries to choke Dman
to the eshop I mean
/me raises his hands, trying to resist being choked.
I don't, my sister does
/me stops choking Dman
She bought it with the intent of getting the free games
Sorry man.
Ok srsly nao
My rage took over.
Ew Piracy
:P
Dat 'Libera Me From Hell'
irrational
I have to get my rage out somehow.
Dude - Runnin'
....
x.x
oh my
Alright Dermathil~
You bastard.
you mean how people confuse it as another DS upgrade Luna?
Well no
The 3DS is doing really bad
I mean, to lower the price in 4 months and offer 20 free games just to get people to buy it
Not to mention, they've basically decided that "making 3D games out of older 2D games is /hard/"
speaking of
What's the point of expensive bespoke hardware (ignoring the 3D image stuff) when people can already buy a smorgasbord of games on most modern mobile phones?
About my MLP/PR story, I've come up with a synposis for it
well tbh the sole purpose for the slowing momentum was that there were no good games at launch and it's taking a helluva long time for good games to come out
synopsis*
plus it was steep for a handheld
ok
....smartphones are NOT proper gaming devices! *snorts*
b-but
jk
Smartphones are garbage
THINK OF THE MONEY
Smartphone is all I need for games
Minireview?Ok.Honestly,the MeetthePegascout one was the worst.
A decent laptop is all I need for everything *cough*
Not some half baked smartphone :p
Triboom? oh dot oh
/me respawns?
also lol barry
I've only seen OoT, the other games look entertaining, but nothing good at all
and yeah BF
I was thinking of putting this up on Ponychan, but without even a sample of the story to go with it, I doubt it would be received well
If that's the case nick, the sensible decision for marketing would be to wait until they had more games to release
yeah Luna, totally right they did rush out the 3DS no questions asked
: /
once the more higher profile games come in, it'll get rolling
Hey, write a fic ^_^
regardless with Xmas still to come and more promising games coming out, it should hopefully pick up
I've got it in the works, but it's not that far in
Glad to hear it
Hey Dman,wanna play some TF2?
Again; considering the price of some popular smartphones, why would consumers feel compelled to purchase more pricey handheld hardware that does even less than a phone?
But eh << >>
wb
the heck how'd I get DC'd?
ty
but cna't today
wb nick
(getting up in abour 6 hours)
At least the 3DS has buttons that you can use :P
Ok.I'm gonna play some TF2 anyways.Seeya tommorow guys!
sorry to hear that : -/
yeah @ BF
Everything I do on my laptop, I can do on a smartphone
Not exactly :P
Well if you give me boarding and breakfast I'll hunt the witch
Bye Pegacron
It might not have hardcore gaming capabilites, but it does a whole lot more

How well does any smartphone multitask
Quite well actually

10Then you joined
7I doubt it.
7Yes, the similarities are there, but there are also disparities.'
7-'
7Now, NS?
Yeah
Buffalo's claim is a lie perpetrated by a single year in which they had 199 inches
Their normal snowfall is under 60
7And about ShadowSuicune; she found TST's IRC.
er, 93.6 is their average
7Haii couldn't do that. :U
Syracuse's average is 116.4
10I suppose
I was cheering for the record this last winter
/me 7suddenly notices an overuse of :U she uses.
Yeah, P&P looks like fun.
10Pokemon

10Seeya
I like Lavender bathwash :p
Hmm.... pools of 6-siders, to be totalled, interesting.
03God dang it
03my TST server is still down
At least Ocean is Still Alive for now
03yes but I mean
03I paid $80 for a year
03the way I see it
03that's 80/52 dollars a week
03my server has been down for a week
03they're starting to owe me money >_>
03plus I'm fricking annoyed as I like island XD
I liked The Island too
The Island, the movie?
Oh, I see
Hello people
oh?
03-|
03hm
03but I had an idea
There's also a bestiary: https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=explorer&chrome=true&srcid=0B3c5FOJEDIrxZjM1MTdhMDQtYjA4Yi00Y2NhLTk2MTgtMWEzZjI5ZTZhMDAy&hl=en_US
http://www.dreamwidth.org/userpic/741747/454005
Dat title in the cover page of the first gdoc
Bestiary has rules for Baby Dragons, Buffalo, Griffons, and Zebras
>mfw no further references to drills or spirals beyond the title
Q_Q
03I just submitted another support ticket, this time clearly sounding pissed
11.•10«11WB10 (eXAKR10) 11WB10»11•. 10- Nah, I ate the scanner this time
03I mean, if they actually responded going "oh, our server is down", that would be a bit more acceptable
that's how they got the manticore and cockatrices in
You could sue them
Which won't work very well :P
03LOL
03well
Not really
g'day all from the ponystate downunder
03http://failbook.failblog.org/2011/08/11/funny-facebook-fails-john-from-nebraska/#more-41497 <- FAIL
Manticore and cockatrice predate D&D by a few thousand years
never said the opposite
03well
reporting to the BBB can definately have some effect
03they have a forum, and there haven't been any posts since like 4 months ago >_>
03I tried calling them
03I mean, WTF

Something
03-l
03but at least they spelled her name right
yeah, totally.
That's a stupid mistake anyway
Conner isn't even a name, it's always spelled Connor
They're a Conner
03but it seems I see it spelled wrong more often than not :/

Aquarion?
9no we'll watch Aquarion later
HQ is beautiful
9this is Gravion
9that mech with the girl called luna in it
LQ is definitely LQ
If you don't like π, you can have an 
Are Gravion and Aquarion related?
9nah
9just similar names
whew hehehe
9restreaming
Oooh, movie I just saw advertised looks awesome.
9how does LQ look?
9is it watchable?
Apparantly I can write checks with my computer: ‰
watchable.... but not particularly enjoyable : /
9going to boost LQ a bit
especially on side by side comparison with hq
UStream doesn't want to Load for me
It does that to me occassionaly
mine quit also
just now
9low quality
9low quality has been boosted
9had to close broadcast
9now please compare them both side by side
9sakusen kaiishi!
No, I was loading it before
ÏÅÍÓÔÍÅÎ Chess anyone?

Hmm...I am having much fun with my unicode...
9so?
still loading.
1 minute
Denied_Existence: I don't think that last one you used was unicode. I do recognise them as the " that the french uses.
9fawk
Oh hey, I got me some simulones: §
9nobody managed to watch them?
9well going to switch to Dai-Guard
didn't skip one bit
BAA BABABABABABABABA
BAA BABABABABABABABA
9it was probably that Skype took some of my bandwidth
>››››››
Hmm
9now that it's closed
Some unicode doesn't end the same as I type it
Hallo
>>>>>>
››››››››
BAA BABABABABABABABA
BAA BABABABABABABABA
9how was that?
zero skipping in the HQ
Hello!:D
9please watch HQ first and then switch to LQ
It only registers the audio
……………
9let me
9restart it
I DIDNT KNOW THEY HAD THAT
My ustream is still not loading.
UNICODE HAS A SHORTCUT FOR ...
I mean only has audio
9it was
9it's fixed now
9gonna restart the song
wait a sec before starting
9watch HQ first
9and then LQ
do it
9so it should take more bandwidth now
(watching both)
I have ze magiks! MUAHAHAHAHAHAHA
5 secs in delay
yeah
LQ is quicker than HQ
Although I am sure my favorite is definitely 
I mean
9that doesn't really matter though
9what matters is if either is skipping
No skipping nowhere
9frabjulous day!
wb Kos (late)
LQ lags more than HQ for me.
9so ustream is instantaneous
9I see
LET'S UNCORK THE WINE
9Polarfire did you have both open at the same time
>mfw I actually don't drink wine
9neither do I LOL
9I don't drink period
9only if it's Smirnoff Ice
9but that's basically lemonade
HAHAHA
9Dermathil: but you have high bandwidth
in case I pinged or something
but thanks anyway :3
60Mbps
yes I did
9I just don't see the point of intoxicating myself
9with drinks that taste like SHIT
9okay guys
9here it is
9THE MOMENT OF TRUTH
same thing. I find alcohol to taste like shit.
9aka my streaming benchmark since years ago
NO PROBLEM UNTIL NOW
9how was that?
Smae result, HQ is considerably smoother
okay floofer
got kinda grainy at the end
NO SKIPPING AT ALL
yep no skipping in hq.
9that graininess could only be helped
9by upping the quality
9and I can't up it any more
I noticed some in LQ
KEPT THE SAME DELAY THROUGHOUT!
/me floofs back
darn, well, there wasn't any skipping though
9so basically it's keeping yes
Graininess was not bad for me.
9I would call it a sucess
9yeah graininess is not really a problem
9mainly because
well, "sync"
9yeah
9okay
9after that
lol
OH HECK YEAHG
9and after that going offline to get tomorrow's material
lol
/me requests nyan pinkie
But I am perfectly fine with eating my π and 's.
9these are high-quality DVDRIPS
9BEST GANDAM
LQ is a few secs ahead even after refresh on this one.
9that can't be helped
Refresh on veemi I mean
9HQ encode takes time
9LQ is instantaneous transmission
yeah, Its a little more of a delay than last time. Just thought I would mention
9the LQ stream basically sees things with a .5 delay compared to me
9HQ on the other side: 5 secs
9as long as there's no skipping in the stream
no skipping
9but first
9got to find a way to make RJ borderless
9a second
I request a live reading of something
:3
Live reading of Witch of the Westmareland!
9we aren't
9I have to download the material for tomorrow
9the accident has put me behind on schedule XD
awww.... you can talk to us while you download : D
9sure thing
9would lower the quality of the stream a lot thoug
9and only stream one
9but yeah
9in any case
9give me a moment
9going offline
I just thought I would.... you know.... throw that out there.

how is the search for streamers going?
fruitful?
How much did you say the streaming software you guys use costs?
its free I believe
9gonna take mid-route
9it's free
correct me if I'm wrong
9but if you wanna stream the hub/poni episodes
9you should get EasyCap
9which is like 12 bucks online I believe
9okay guys
9uh
9gonna start
9in either or
noproblem
9the other route had too many robots I dislike

he changed his ident somewhat'
it's the same
Dmasti
doesn't the ident include the numbers after that?
they changed
no, ident is just the name I think
yea, though I don't know if you can gline by realname
that would be pointless seeing as they can just change it
Yeah
Usually with attacks, I just add repeat, flood, join and part kicks to the channel
They can still spam, but not for long

my day is now complete

Still going
still going
weird
I still dont see anything
sadface
owait nvm
do you get signal?
goodnight
I'm calling it a night, too
okay
Gotta run errands tomorrow.
On my end, got to go do errands right now
12o-o
http://www.cracked.com/article_19376_5-scientific-reasons-your-idea-happiness-wrong.html
Hey
okay
9HQ is live only at the moment
9Ghosties, let's run this opening with just HQ first
Alright
9how was that?
My broadcast was offline
9derp
9okay
9rerunning
9are you ready now?
Want me to refresh the stream?
9please and thanks
Alright
Alright, whenever you're ready
9okay
9commence operation
9okay
9how was that?
9okay then
No problems on my end
Okay, give me the link to LQ again
9later on, you'll watch LQ only
!cynder
NEVER WORKS
Anyway bbl
9and finally, both simultaneously
9as in both at the same time
04k
Whatever you did differently this last time worked
9okay then
Hey again
9LQ is running currently in uStream
Okay
9recommencing operation
LOL
It did work...once.
/me FLEES
9how was that?
Slight freeze
for like a second
During the steps scene
I think
9Cobalt: give me a moment to finish my tests here
04Once upon a time
I think
I believe
9well that means
9it was probably just some bandwidth issue
9I just fixed it
12o-o
9okay, now
9see the LQ stream
9also don't worry about it, Cob
Give me the link
9http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bronystate-low-quality
Do you want me to run both streams, or just LQ?
/me sighs
9just LQ for now
9after that
9I'm gonna run a slight upgrade that should improve LQ
9without costing any more bandwidth
9kay, starting
Okay, I'm ready
ooh
whats wrong Drf? :(
03nothing really
9I take it was smooth albeit pixelated?
The sound was a little fuzzy
oh
Lol
And yeah, it was fairly smooth but pixelated
9I can imagine
9roger
But the sound was
9please run both simultaneously
just fuzzy
Hold on
03http://cheezfailbooking.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/funny-facebook-fails-mum-ftw.jpg
Okay, whenever you're ready
9you should see a slightly sharper image in LQ
03http://cheezfailbooking.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/funny-facebook-fails-what-a-nightmare.jpg
Yeah, I could tell it sharpened slightly
Still
it's pretty pixelated
9okay
9gonna rerun them
Alright
9also the delay between both is not important
(which is stalled btw)
BABABABABABABABABABABABABAB OH OH
12!blame junh1024-XD's dream
9how was that?
Glacmyr woud you liek to read it?
The HQ stream froze twice
again, only for a second though
9okay
9that means one thing
9the real problem we were having was rather simple
Hmmm... now to choose wakeup music
9it had nothing to do with bandwidth or capacity to stream
Oh, well that's good
9but with this
9and considering you can run some hefty games
hefty?
I dunno
9well maybe I'm wording it wrong
9but I think you could run the stream
9in any case
9this operation has been successful
9I mean that if you can run games like you do
9your hardware should be up to the task of streaming
9in any case, I think I shall drop the tests here for now
9for I need to get prepared for tomorrow
:D
9and one of them
9is
9"Location, Location, Location"
9in other words
9do you have a Stream service in mind you'd like to use?
Well I figured since yours seemed to be working well that I'd go with Veemi.
12o-O
O_o
9for you see
9there is something I learned today that's very important
whathappen?
might have been EQD. Not sure.
9Adobe FME
9 3.2
Have you been to the streams before?
9is a CPU resource hog
9in the greatest sense of the word
Only a couple times, but yes.
Alirght
9as in
*Alright
oh, fun.
9this means a very simple thing for you
9you have three choices, I believe
9first, is to move to another stream client.
9second choice
9is to investigate if FFXIV is more CPU or GPU dependant
I must write this down...
9the third is actually an offshoot of the second
9Denied: I'm working on a streaming guide
9so you don't have to write anything down
9if you don't like intermediaries
9FME is not for you
Well then that is useful
9however, if used properly
Why o_o
9FME can also give you the best quality for the lowest bandwidth
9in other words
9it's a two-edged sword, at this stae
9*state
Y U DO DIS!!!
9it's stupid easy to use
9however it also comes with a 50-viewer limit
12with hopes you'll fall for it
9unless you can get that shit validated
12:)
9and get unlimited viewers for free as such
9good luck with that, though
I HATE procaster. It REFUSES to work with my mac here...
9uStream can also use FME for best quality
9Denied: that's because Procaster for Mac is in much earlier stagese
Well THAT might explain it.
Woah, text
Some things make no sense...
9right click
9and check "show disconnected devices" and "show disabled devices"
9then tell me if you see "Stereo Mix" among them
9just right click on the speaker icon in the taskbar, son
9well
9that means you'd have to use VAC with it
9which, frankly, I don't know jack about
9okay then
9will you be streaming fullscreen?
9well
9sorry
9let me rephrase that
Well, kind of? I have 2 monitors, and I planned to stream the entirety of one of them.
9I see
9give me a moment
9I must fetch a program for you
9here http://depositfiles.com/es/files/lpfyhk21n
9well
9.....
9wait a second
9I need that shit.
9you're going to see why in a moment
9for now, install VHSCRCAP
oh, sure. I think the program I use makes whatever you make borderless automatically fit itself to "fullscreen" on whatever monitor it's on. Can't drag it around.
9that's still a great program
ok, installed and launched.
9for, you see
9okay
9now
9question one
uh...I feel kind of dumb here, you mean my upload/download speeds? (sorry, I know it seems that I'm probably not fit to run a stream if I don't even know this ._.;)
9nah it's okay
9I also learned most of my shit on the go
yep, gotta start somewhere.
damn smilies <_<. I think I'm paying for 20/3?
12:D
30/5.
Another person I hate. -_-
9roger
9let's talk theoretics, then
30/5 ;_;
02I need a random animal
9and you're going to exclusively use Upload Speed for streaming
9you should probably make sure you use 1 Mbps for streaming, tops
9that is 1000 Kbps
02hi
9okay
9let's say you use
9and 192 Kbps for audio
12red-tailed hawk
12SheenaFox :3
9okay
9now
9open FME
k
9now
k done.
9okay
9now
9hopefully
12How are you?
12:)
9tell me when you find it
found it in the newly installed files for the VH player thing.
12Hi Bree
Hmm...
12yep
opened.
9that works too
9now you should see a list
Yep.
9if there are any other items, but they do not contain (active), ignore it
9okay
9select it
Just the one shows up.
k.
02Done
02Anything else?
12hmm..
12dolphin
9roger
9now you should see three tabs
9the middle one should be settings
9go to that one
!tstposts
k.
9okay
03fail.
02Lol I'll try
02Anyone else want to give me an animal?
12what is this for anyway?
9now make sure only "Resize to Output Size" and "Keep Aspect" are selected
9for absolutely, ABSOLUTELY NO REASON
9use "Optimize Screen Capture"
02I'm doodling
got it.
12oh
well, more of a statement actually <_<
that.
9hold on
9okay
9go to the "Capture" tab
02Anything? Xd
9press select
9you should have a crosshair
9just hover over that window
02You guys all went quiet lol
9take note of the resolution
12you said anyone else
12lol
9click it
9and presto.

02Well I'm trying to draw drfyena
02.-.
Well it appears to have sort of worked, when launching FME again it shows just the FFXIV window, however it's not streaming. at all. stuck on one frame.
/me draws drfbear
They're all chub :<
03LOL
03no
I'm talking about the other girls you hit on *shot*
04SHINY

03uh
12o.o
03just normal colored?
12give him some blingbling
aww, oh well.
03LOL bling
03maybe a Droid?
9you should probably
9use justin.tv
9it's simpler
9remember, with streaming, there is always multiple options
Michigan hat
9VHScrCap should serve you well, though
I must try this someday as an operator if my interview is ever scheduled
It says FFXIV on it, but it works for any program.
it just runs in the background, have whatever program you want fullscreen and borderless selected and hit CTRL+ALT+F
comes with multiple versions of it for different resolutions.
I wish I could have pancakes
03http://sale.images.woot.com/The_Perfect_Moment8enDetail.png
02I'd draw some for you, but I'm too busy making out with my Monroebot

03o.o
9ghosties
9are you here?
03I don't watch that show
03I've seen like 3 episodes total
just as a heads up.
9I'd suggest NOT using FME
02http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xsa3iZBUwI
9as it might be consuming too much CPU resources
12shame
03LOL
yo dawg...haha
9so for you
9I'd recommend using justin.tv
9roger.
9I'll send you my guide when it's done

03that being said
03how to get island's configuration files from a FRICKING NONRESPONSIVE SERVER >:/
03unless you have a local copy archived?
Yeah
03amazing
except it's an old version
03only problem I see is the IP
and I don't think it has all the opers
03oh
03OK
well
03well
03I guess don't bother
03as >IP address
it should be able to connect to ocean regardless of IP
03well
03island.lugia.us
03would not work
due to nocheckhost or nohostcheck
well yes that wouldn't
but it'd link
03exactly
03well
03eh
03if you want to try it
03go ahead LOL
I'll wait until the server comes back up
/me runs
lmao
03I basically yelled at universe hosting saying they now owe me moner
03*money
03way I see it
yell at them a little more
03I paid for a year of hosting
03that's 52 weeks
03it's been down over a week
03they owe me 1/52 of wha tI paid
03which is like $2 LOL
U AMD?
it's been down for possibly a total of nearly 3 weeks
03no, I intel
03oh
U MADOKA?
03see I told them 2 weeks
03wtf is madoka

Junh, U MEGUKA?
/me runs
03you know though
no
03doesn't basically every anime of that type have Mahou Shoujo in its title?
Meguka is suffering
03*LOL
03so by people on TST calling it Mahou Shoujo
Madoka was just a 12-ep series in 2010
Drf, that phrase means magical- yeah
03is like me calling Pokémon "anime"
03it's not really the name of the show but just th egenre
03which for some reason Japanese people like to make explicitly celear
I call it madoka magica, as do a lot of people for that reason
Mahou Shojo or Magical Girl is a genre
03IN CASE THE COVER HAVING FOUR GIRLS ISN'T ENOUGH TO GUESS THAT IT'S ABOUT A MAGICAL GIRL, ahem
/me hides
._|
02Back
Sailor moon & Cardcaptors fall in to that genre
03when I originally asked where that kyuubey thing came from
03someone told me "Mahou Shoujo"
Madoka magica
03I was like wut
QB comes from PMMM
03so apparently people seem to think that's the actual name of the show LOL
Puella magi is another name for it
03yeah, uso said I might like Nanoha
a movie came out last year & they're planning more. It's a re-telling of the old series od eps
As that's the term used in the anime for that kind of magical girl
just get E_D's rips
03except isn't Kyuubey some odd cat type thing?
03>rips
yeah
03DVDs or GTFO
YOU GTFI
*O
03k
03I have seasons 1 and 2
03Drako60 ripped them for me
03from his netflix
All those discs work on my end
Its a type of fox in japan culture
03ah
03wait
03or you have other discs?
VOBs
of all
03ew
03but it's > nothing
/me is very picky about his piracy
VOBs because >encoder-friendly
03GHOST FOXES
03I mean
03hi
03um
03what
03well
no
03in the anime, yes
/me dies
03is R2 DA though?
03wait
03wasn't that one episode
03Ghost of Maiden's Peak
no, but i plan on is/stalled
03about a ninetailes?
Maidens peak no
03o_o
03well it's been a while
But yeah there is one
03but I swear there's an episode lik eit
03where they're all tricked into thinking there are humans living there?
That aside though
03but it's just an inllusion?
03*illusion
03Rating: R - 17+ (violence & profanity)
03wtf
03@ Madoka
03LOL that's an actual legend and not just an anime character?
madoka was R? O.o
Madoka has lots of violnce
03it's anime
03that's expected
03hence why I like more "kid friendly" anime like Pokémon and Sailor Moon XD
03none of that gruesome crap
03I mean, Bleach was good
03and I need to get back to watching more Bleach
03but even then it was a bit overkill
03yeah but
03Kyuubei or w/e was based on a real 'character'?
kyuubi means nine tailslol
03oh
03OK
/me thinks of the song "People are Strange"
03I mean
03hi
hi
:D
Yeah madoka was harshly dark....but I still wouldn't classify it as R imo
9okay boys
03anime movie
9refresh this page
03it was a good movie
9c'mon
9I dare
9you
9do it
03it's anime horror, which is something relatively rare as far as I know
....then again...maybe I would now that I think about it
9it's a nice feature
03if that says anything about how messed up it is
:D
03actually not evne that
03*even
03and yes, it's anime, they show the entire thing
/me dies
http://www.megaupload.com/?d=0SBCU031 < this is ep 1 of MSLN with AC3 audio
Lolwow
03story wise it's actually a really good movie
cant remember if it was R2 or not
03as it's one of those psychological horror type things
03but that definitely should be R
03it's "unrated" in America
03if you're into messed up anime, give it a watch
/me hides
like
i usually dont like 3psychological horror type things anime
03well
my hands are shaking
03I'm into thrillers
03not HORROR mind you
i'm burnt in two places
lol
03even something like Speed would count as that really
"Switch stream to low quality"
03anyway
03yes, tha'ts the name ofh it
9are we 20% cooler yet?
03I have the DVD

I'd also like to point out the fail that is the riot police too. they didn't do much, and whenever they actually intervened they went OTT and really hurt the people far more than tehy should have
7Except for the AI, sure.
More likely than not, the cops simply lack experience handling riots like that
yea
I think I should go to sleep
I'm not hatin' 'em all, the goverment really derp'd.
Then again, tear gas. Dunno why it ain't used more liberally
Same train of though here
*thought
Such as?
tuition fees, benefits, jobs
I bring this up because of a ponychan UK merch thread
where two, not one, but two, said their local shops with ponies had been raided
Wat
WAT
>Uk merch AT LONG LAST. >mostly only Tescos having it >Tescos is very very popular convenience store >Tescos raided >No merch D:
they idorts : /
That's not how you send a message to the government, contrary to (F***ING) popular belief
You should see back in my country
oh?
i still get mad at police thou, they also dunno how to handle it, either being too passive, or far too aggressive : /
Really?
There was a HUGEASS strike for one day in england with teachers
Yet, they are the ones with the most benefits when it comes to government employees
that's all, just one day where nearly all UK schools closed for one day
the reason for this one day uk strike was cuz instead of loads of money after retirement they'd have some
but still
just one day of not working
and the government took action
government ain't done anything yet
Okay, bye!
PEOPLE Y U NO realise
oO
Noooooooooo
Minnet come back!
K
not leaving the laptop on, sorry.
OK
Minnet shall be sorely missed
Back home, every week you'd hear "Oh? Teachers on strike again?" from someone
They'd take one of the main roads between my city and the capital
Or maybe a government building or two
Thats the thing
Public education in my country is a complete mess
: /
waitwat
i actuallly read that as 'miss 50', then WATed, then reread 'GET 50'
Wat.
Yup
: /
That sucks, man

The target demographic being young girls, the adult fans being ... adults
See, the show was, like nearlly all modern cartoons, to sell products
however, the team behind it did an amazing job:
unique female characters (no stereotypes really)
amazing music
great, great animation
clever storylines that don't just involve tea parties and shopping sprees

My computer is like 7 years old
13Oh wow, thanks :3
Could make me srsly interested in online gaming again, that's how I feel.
because again my computer is old
Since it's coming to PS3, and that probably means SteamWorks enabled :D
Well, it is coming on X360 and PS3 and MAC too
I really hope they put in Move support... it really helps my aim a lot.
hi
RP: that's why I said possible platforms
X360 won'T have steamworks similarly to TF2
Oh, okay :P
Can we please have This Island Earth be the MST3K one?
nah
they don't want to use MST3K versions
;_;
and besides it is already downloaded
RP, that's because it was in 2007.
May the Buddha have mercy on our souls.
and PS3 and X360 don'T work the same
Well yeah, I mean the underlying graphics interface is the biggest difference, though.
I'm pretty sure CS:GO is gonna push COD and Battlefield aside.
I dont really think
but not on consoles
Well I dont know I dont look at numbers
oh yeah
Simply because there are professional teams of it.
Disregarding schedules, of course
also, valve-time is there for a reason.
Coming out this winter season.
still cant believe they are ding that unveil with the 1 million dollar prinze
In this case, "little" is relative to Valve-time
lol, yeah, we'll have to wait just a little for Episode 3, I'm guessing
WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY?!?!?!?!?!

13<3
Hi all

9sup Prose, Val
/me runs
hey Val
hey Prose
7Hmmm....
7Well, I ended my YouTubeWalk.
Ponies&Parasprites
YOU DONT'?
nah
too much fanfic
can't stand it
/me is shunned?
TO THE MOOOOOOOOON
There's a button called "No-Fanfiction." use it.
/me 6wraps a snake in a bow around Nick's neck
is it me, or does the stream occasionally stutter?
orly?
hoy hoy guys
http://www.equestriadaily.com/search/label/Not-Fanfiction
use that link
if you don't like Fanfiction.
6OH
6as a bullet pattern?
huh
that's pretty neat
6I remember talking about that once xD
7Yes.
But even if you use the Not-Fanfiction mode, Val, it is worth it to go on EqD.
9hold on
9gonna lower the quality a bit
yeah I guess
6there would be no way to survive that without bombing LOL
9since I still got a few downloads to run
9kay, live again
6you need gatorskin shoes
9we're at the quality we used to have for all previous BMNs
7o.O
Valve's cashing out CS now? IS NOTHING SAFE???
No
nononon
9how is it now?
Hi
They are gonna bring back the CS:1.6 bullet perforation
9>Valve Cashing on CS
aye
9bitches don't know about Counter-Strike Neo
hoy hoy barry
9is the degradation of quality noticeable?
9as in the lower quality, I mean
well, yeah it's a bit blurrier
not by much
9it shouldn't be too much considering that most of the optimizations I made here were regarding input
9but yeah it should be just a tiny bit blurrier
how is that cashing in?
9not really
9as I said
9bitches don't know about Counter-Strike Neo
9nor do they know about Counter-Strike Online
6angel
Barry: Yes, we do learn the significance fo the cracks
let the old giants lie imo
CS had a good run
9get her out of there before she starts singing
but Deculture!
no, I'm saying I'm sick of them releasing the same things over and over again
whereas Ep3 has merit
seems a bit like it val
9>implying it won't be Half-Life 3 instead.
It's not an either/or situation
well, they said from the beginning the episodes were a trilogy
9>fuck them
06espeons
9that said
6everywhere
9Valve time is something I can get behind
6!Espeon
6 20minute get
9but that's because they don't want to release a shoddy product
meh, I'd much rather have a shorter episode for much less cash
13rarrr
Valve time, takeing soon™ up to eleven.
and then have HL3 (in the event such a thing existed) be just like HL2 was to HL
in that it's the same universe, but VERY different story arc
6http://i51.tinypic.com/2s96syr.jpg
you're used where you're gonna be useful
9they're different departments
13LOL I like that
(1.6 bullet perforation, for example)
9Source doesn't have shootan through wallsan?
It was different
not the same
9how is the stream right now?
9currently downloading another file
stream's good
good
I even hear they could be adding Aiming Down sight.
but also compare the release dates with episodes 1 and 2
2006 to 2007
we're now in 2011
lol
9that might be interesting
She just STARES
9as long as they haven't cancelled Episode 3
9Valve ain't Crapcom
eh
they said the delay between Ep 2 and ep 3 would be longer than the delay between Hl2 and Ep 2 I think.
that's really old news
6lol
yes, but even if it's supposed to be longer
there comes a time when it's just TOO long
I mean, don't get me wrong
I REALLY want ep3 to be everything we expect
who's the designated streamer today?
but the longer they take, the more at risk they are of repeated DN's mistake
9KIRABOSHI~
that's bs
eyy
sorry, that's complete bs
no it isn't.
it's an excuse for their shoddy work
And it isn't an excuse.
I'm saying that they failed miserably, and are just pretending they wanted it to be like that
To say they CHOSE to make it as shitty as it is is WAY worse than saying it was merely an accident.
/me 9cackles manically
9GANDAMU DABURUU EKKUSU, FURRU POWAA
lol
well they can SAY whatever they want, it doesn't change the fact that they fucked up
yeah
6wheee :D
And to say they chose to make it like that means they decided to make it a fuck-up. alright? To say you wanted to make it a fuck-up is worse than saying you didn't want to.
didn't even know about apple bloom
Good luck!
Shame squaresoft never let them use the xenogears in any of these.
I like the gundams >.<
