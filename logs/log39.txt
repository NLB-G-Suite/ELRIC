mi cara cuando
/me runs
This is why I don't pay attention to this channel anymore
drf: they told her to get you worked up thats why
:P
/me runs
12But yeah, a visual verification does keep people like IT from joining sites
^
i was signing in for visual verificution
;p
7O.o
:P
inb4 drf throws another fit
I don't think visual verification is for that more than robots
mentlegen
12It's for both
03not really, I just don't sit there and watch people break rules
/me 7blinks at that wording.
Lily Blossom will be my unofficial Derpy http://i84.photobucket.com/albums/k7/claireerose/MLPTP%20Games/LilyBlosomFIM.jpg

Flyin' LLAMAS

Not on the east coast yet

espescially Bumblesweet, Lily Blossom, Firecracker Burst, and Pepperdance

I just want Fluttershy and Roseluck

12What web site is this?
What do you think Pepperdance's special talent is?
Maybe she makes hot sauce
you know how they stomp grapes to make wine?
hot sauce, eh?
hot sauce

It's good to know that so many game makers and web comics are joining the herd.
12Good night
Revolver
Indeed.
Maybe with Valve, we'll get that Pinkie Sphere mod for real.
Where are you, Revolver?
That would be the greatest win ever, even if I've never fully played either Portal.
this music assignment makes no sense
12Also, once you finally finish signing up, please don’t be a nooB
we have to try to find the rythm of a verse of a song
how the hell
Greetings, Outline.
Hey there Blank.
:o
outline?
Anything of interest happening this morning?
HI OUTLINE
Hello Fiddler :)
6Oh, sorry wasn't paying attention.
6Thirty BILLION chats open at the same time.
6But it went quite well, except Starship Troopers was lagtastic.
god......all chats are dead.....
yeah
that used to happen to me before too
O.o
HD encodes are difficult if you don't have a good desktop
toss some revives everywhere
Slow day.
O.o
/me 7D:s
7My butterfly pen is broken.
6Well, it's a laptop, so... yeah.
Man... the chat always seems dead whenever I show up. It's marvelous really.
6And apparently the version I had was HD blueray, so...
Shame.
Oh, uh.
I can imagine
let's make it un-dead
but still
We're working on a small WIP movie at the moment to show.
it's a problem that in the end was within expected parameters
6Yeah, managed to get the lag down to a minimum, so it wasn't that huge of a deal.
7On a random note, who wants a Magic Bounce Natu? :P
6Someponies said it was actually funny and added to the movie, so... XD
but still man
we appreciate your work
that said, since you're the only person who has streamed aside from me so far
I'll let you keep the admin access until someone else streams in place
since I want it to be indicative of the current streamer and all
i'm gonna kill myself
i hate my internet...
I have to keep it since I'm the channel's founder, though, but yeah
4Hey Cynder
4CoD mode
Hating your internet is probably not a good reason to do that. Just saying.
:(
sadface for emphasis
12nooooo
7?
6So, I assume I'm going to be doing Saturdays for a while?
hi
what's up?
hi
if you're up for it
6I have nothing against it.
Frankly Saturdays are pretty tough for me
6Hey!
6Aaa..MW2 ftw. :3
There we go, external drive cleared.
Hey there CW. By the looks of things, nothing much.
12hi
Now I can back up my laptop fresh before I flood it with episode avis
Wow.
Whoever's writing those fanfics about Trixie and Twilight sure can... write. xD
augh terrible ship
Not really...
:P
Silver_Heart: which? ballad of TS?
I kid of course
The one about her and Twilight in the spa.
And then the one that follows that story up.
4Yea
Someone call Rev
5Hola peoples~!
6Well, that's fine.
6My schedule is as open as ever.
Butterscotch Sundae
that said
I'm about to propose something for when I get vacation time
I said I was going to try streaming every day, right?
6I do believe so.
or at least, almost every day
well
first thing in the order of operations
6One question..Is the multiplayer hacked? Cause I heard something like that and I'm intending to get the game.. >.<
7Hey, RP4L!
would be streaming a Hideo Kojima classic, that could be deemed an "Interactive Movie"
Yes, I am referring to the Cyberpunk Adventure, SNATCHER
5Was wondering where everyone was. xD
4Hacked?
5Falling Skies premieres in roughly half an hour. 8D
it's pretty much a movie game, and holy shit is it AMAZING to either play or watch
6Yeah..
it could probably be run through in a day or two at most
4Define hacked here
6That... would be amazing.
I like it
12hi
and after that
5I really hope it's good. There hasn't been a good scifi on cable TV since.. well, maybe when USA was forced to cancel The 4400 and The Dead Zone...
we're obviously jumping into Policenauts
5Ohi Umbreon~ :3
because POLICENAUS
12:)
*POLICENAUTS
3MB a second? This is going to take forever ( _ _)
5Hey NS~ :3
o-O
12Hello! :3
What's Policenauts?
Where/
never heard of it until now
12Power went out, lol
5HML, hm?
6Honestly Idk what exactly the guy meant by it..But anyway..it's normal and stuff,isn't it? Nothing weird or whatever?
4Give me a minute to test it i haven't yet
:P
6Ok :P
5OH.
5I see.
Heya GL :3
5Man I cannot keep track of all you guys and your alternate nicknames. :|
12Hello ^^
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njMK04xlSf4

12Most people just call me GL <:
5Oh, all right. That works.
7Mine are consistent.
5What's it short for..? Just out of curiosity.
5Quan, yeah, I know. (And appreciate it lol.)
7Lol, you're welcome. :)
I have never changed my nick, well only once when I first came here ;P\
5Yeah but some people have changed their nicks
5especially on the forums and stuff
5(like if they got into the whole MLP thing)
Those people...
Should be ignored, sadly </nicething>
12I’ve only ever had one legit nick change
7My alternate nickname for IRC, as you know, is in case of ghosting or from another computer.
lolwtf
Cone2 wat
!chatstats
Chat stats updating.

4Nice
good evening every pony
6^^
hm >:I
5Sky, not right now. xD
Greetings.
5But I had my bike put away for winter and then I realized "oh.. I should ride this thing".
5Because I don't drive, I've just been walking everywhere.
10I can't even recall the last time I used mine
I have never been able to ride a bike :|
It makes me sad and lulz
good evening Zen
5And I plan on taking it to college with me in the fall since car lots are REALLY EXPENSIVE anyways. Bike slots are free and I have a lock anyways. |D
Well, shake him off
5HML, you never learned? D:
I did
But, keyword is: Unable
I caaan't.
Terrible balance, I gave up :D
04skyyy
4CoD is fun
I liked the one DND posted better, because of it's bigger screen.
10Yes, plus much cleaner for the environment (and no, I am not an environmentard)
ALTAIR
And the bike seats are kinda hard/low XD
Stalkmeria
ohai
4So for i have played WaW Black ops and MW2
;o
5N'aww.
6It sure is :O
YOU'RE BACK
6Same
/me hugs
4Zombie mode is fun
never mind. I guess NiuDeeCeeDee, and NewDCD are one and the same?
WHy not?
:D
/me hugs back
VNC fucked up
what is going on may I ask
5Lol that's part of the reason I don't like driving is because they /are/ bad for the environment.. but mainly because driving scares me half to death and MORE PEOPLE DIE IN CAR ACCIDENTS THAN ANYTHING ELSE.
about 10 hours ago
bah as usual
derp
set up teamviewer
or, aren't they?
IKR? ;p
Who cares about the enviroment?!
6I didn't play Zombies for too long..Just did a bit in the end of the Black Ops Campaign,got till round 3 once and then gave up on it and started playing DMs.
el derp
uptime is pretty good
shadow is on legendary
6I wish the PS2 version of WaW wasn't so short though..
;D
5Sometimes I don't even like riding in cars.
7D:
5At least buses if they overturn you can get out the roof emergency window.
/me 7sends HML to China.
03LOL
03speaking of driving
4Yea i heard about that
03I was behind the pit of a NASCAR race today :D
03I had a "HOT pass"
03which basically let me do whtaever I wanted
of course
I just set up mIRC to do my bidding
Oh DERF

Yeah
hi aurora
Heya Aurora
6I'm still watching it.
Oh DRF, when can you do the stream of TS3?
Cupcakes is creepy, but I found "Prince Charming" more creepy
You'd think Ponies would drink beer considering barley would fall into their food
beer = yuck
03uh
03whenever
this beer has raspberry flavor
Beer is a funtimes food
trust me, if you had this beer you'd love beer :3

Same here
5Ugh, everyone arrives ten minutes before I gotta leave. :C

6I'm waiting for Radiance to blow up in the face of my sarcasm, or something.
Applejack/RD drinking contest
Hipster, I came up with an idea for the content of the "days I will have free to stream a lot" period during vacations

i still have two more days of them
4:O he keeps running even if i kill him
but then i get into grad school
I'm sorry Zen
so more finals
eventually
:(
I was thinking on, instead, streaming games that are much more like interactive movies, as they last longer and can be said to be more involving.
6o.o
im still in high of the school
I have three games in mind.
5Lol, I'll be back in a few hours.
omg falling skies
welcome back

This meeting of the midnight societ will now come to order
5I'm just watching because I just want to see it with my folks, and it's Father's Day and I know it'd make my dad happy to watch with him. :D

8ok
Wait... are we secret?
5(And no offense but family kind of > IRC. ;D)
I'm waiting for my dad to come home

so I can give him his gift
zeke loves that crap
5What'd you get him?
aeiou
i hated afraid of the dark
and we'll probably spend the night watching NCIS from the beginning lol
03wtf is Falling Skies
allow me to elaborate
these are the games
the first 2 seasons of NCIS and a Star Trek Enterprise bottle opener :D
5New show on TNT!
5IT'S GOT
5ALIENS
the first and second would be Hideo Kojima classics
he's a trekkie lol
5 8DDDDDDD
That show freaked me out so much as a kid
03heh
5OMG ME TOO
5 /shot
you guys would get along well
you should watch Doctor Who
indeed
from the beginning
6NO WAY I DIDN'T KNOW
the first, Snatcher, which was recently hinted to be getting a sequel in the near future
/me runs
6...
03no
6no lol
03go watch Scrubs
5I LOVE DOCTOR WHO.
LOL Scrubs
03that's like the only show worth watching from 6the beginning
6I'll watch Doctor Who from a couple doctors ago

6SO MANY EPISODES
5Yeah ^

03LOL
6what
Purpose tyop
6was that
typo
I like being freaked out though
Who likes metal
Howdy y'all!
next, another Kojima game, and the spiritual sequel to Snatcher, "Policenauts"
was that on purpose?
5That's like saying "YOU SHOULD WATCH ALL FIVE (six) SERIES OF STAR TREK"
Something strange?
HI!
/me flees
no lol
5"AND THEN ALL THE MOVIES".
I like metal
http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/policenauts/policenauts.htm
are you a silly enough nilly to rescue the president?
In the neighborhood .v.
4XD
how heavy?
I've typoed drf's laptop nick as "drf|faptop" >>
I am a bad enough dude.
Hello, back again.
damn your nick, drf
/me rages
03LOL
A silly dude at that.
and finally, if I manage to get it running...
yay you got the reference!
:)
XD
03darn your dirty mind
Gadget: Past as Future http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/gadget/gadget.htm
03then again
03mine is bad too
03but eh
*smiles*
You secretly like it
We're all bad
/me is rocking face to Five Finger Death Punch - Bad Company [04:22m/1006Kbps/44KHz]
Somehow :<
03I only tend to misread, not miswrite
hence my bringing it up
XD
Yups
03so I'd make a slightly less defective hard drive than you :D
/me rns
03*runs
8i think my only issue would be if people are actually going to turn out to watch these
lmao
I like Five Finger Death Punch.
6For some reason I got reminded of this : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VkJpqKRjTw&feature=relmfu
Pretty good.
6:P
8we had some people getting restless during the Ace Attorney games
Although System of a Down is my favourite.
My voice and his are pretty close, so it makes me all hopeful
but drf, admit that it's true
/me hides
;p
Yea SOAD is a hell of a group
03not really
8i dont know if people will show up specifically to watch a game
):
CONE
He is god
5Cone is back! :3
these are much more "movie-like"; though
It's been back
the entire time
And Disturbed.
Yeah
5Q IS GOD. /shot
But why
just as Cone2
WHY?!
4Ha :p
Disturbed... now they... I dunno
:p
Asylum was okay
the hell
6:P
but I can't say I like it as much as their older stuff
Nice to see the bots are all our overlords
Same.
I think David has improved at singing though
which is nice
-> /os set superadmin on
Believe was the best.
watch the opening of Snatcher, you'll see what I mean http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WchBwgEEZ9s
totes
I AM THE OVERLORD OF YOU ALL
I have them all.
Lulz.
Ten Thousand fists wasn't bad either
Steel is my favorite metal. Such a wonderful alloy..
5:|
I like Gojira, Iced Earth, The Sword, Demons and Wizards and oldschool Iron Maiden
Indestructible sounded like a... like... Ten Thousand Fists again
Although Serpentine is pretty addicting.
6oh my god RP
Go Skylands ;D
6you look so pretty in your grad photo
i know nothing about this
Nightboomfer: I am going to attempt a remake of Winter Wrap-up in that style
/me 6is on the topic of what you look like
03speaking of q
Indestructible was their worst album. Good, but still their worst.
Yes yes very yes
03I saw a whole bunch of trucks at the race earlire that said "KYU" on the side
5Oh, thank you. :3
03I'm being trolled
Oh U
/me Brohoofs Cyril
/me total brohoof back to Nightboomfer
4MW3 will be great
Funny thing, though because I also like people like Pendulum.
Next you'll see DRF
I love powermetal :)
;P
I like everything Revolver. Except PopCountry
5My mom's a pretty great photographer. ^^; She can make me look pretty good.
lets talk about RAVE!
Okay
I really like the style
ITs pretty intense
I can't stand rap.
toobad doubestp
6Yeah :O Actually I was just looking at it on Gamespot.. xD
03but good != hot
/me hides
Or Country, but I can stand rap less.
I like rap becuase of nerdcore
Howdy everypony! :3
I like Outlaw country and gangsta rap
Hey!
5I don't need to look hot. Just presentable. xP
Greetings, Skies.
Did you see her pics again :o
I don't really CARE for Country, but rap annoys me.
03well I like when girls look hot :P
as you can see
Hot =!= Presentable
:o
like, NWA and Johnny Cash
got ya
hi southernskies!
5All right well Falling Skies is on ANY TIME NOW so...
So Presentable = Good
their is no bad genres just genres with a lot of bad music in it
What's the conversation here?
the games are more about "watching" than anything else xD
I mean, it's not that it's BAD.
Zen: truth
Which means Hot = Bad
Yup
/me 5doesn't care what you think, DRF. =P
and they are still AMAZING as fuck
like country
Zen.
Gangsta Rap.
6lol
Chicken little?
what
see, I like the band mushroomhead where they combine superheavy metal and rap
Name 1 good song.
>.>
you can say linkin park does that bu they are not superheavy
Anyone mind fillin' me in on the topic?
Straight Outaa Compton
5See y'all!
talking about various music genres
03LOL @ Family Guy
/me shrugs
California Love
03I've seen this episode before
bai?
8Well, regardless, i think the reputation of not wanting to "watch" video games might turn some people off
Oh, I see!
such a good rap tuen
i dont listen to gansta rap
I also like the old 60's stuff.
F*** Da Police
Like Gene Kelly.
4Same here
You've seen every episode now, haven't you?
8people might just write them off out of hand
also, the fact that they're Hideo Kojima's most underrated classics could also give some leverage
Well, just t'have a word in it then, I'll say that I like country.
...
6Comes out in November,right?
Is it bad I assumed that because of your name?
4Yea
We could sort of tell.
i hate a lot of country music
Not really. I mean, I live in country.
that said
haha
Er, texas
I do have a plan
Rev...
Texas is alright.
But I listen to a lot of other things too.
Not as bad as here.
But alright.
6...this /meta/ thread is reverting backwards into stupidity again.
A few types of Metal, Classical, Some kinds of techno/electronic stuff.
i met a ganster from texas
And now
rave is awesome
03brb
You'd be surprised. Everyone over here thinks they're 'gangsta'
/me watches SW=4
I like psytrance
Infected Mushroom
Skazi
I don't get the obsession with skies here in the south.
I'd watch them.
I think it's kind of sad when you live in Texas and get made fun of for listening to Country.
It's because they're huge an open and beautiful out in the country
6Nice
and that is previewing it during an intermission in BMN...just the opening, though.
less things to block the veiw of it
You don't get the obsession with skies in the south?
I like watching other people play video games That I can otherwise not play myself
and using that to gauge interest
I mean, I've been all over the country, and places like Florida have WAY more blue skies than here.
They're just plain gorgeos!
i like mane the best
er... gorgeous
Opressive, if you ask me.
for instance, I'm watching someone play OoT 3D.
8i would be fine with that
SouthernSkies, I am reading all of your replies in Braeburn's voice
8see how people react
I like the midnight sky during the summer. There's places that you can go way out in the middle of nowhere and see the night sky the way you're supposed to.
Nightboomfer: Probably a good idea. :3
Great, now I'm being tempted to try Second Life, a game I long known to be the final pithole for games... All because of ponies.
With my hair, walking outside is like dropping a weight on my head.
6...I feel like playing Majora's Mask and streaming it now. XD
what kind of hair is that
A Anvilshaped one?
DO IT
Anyway, it's simply beautiful. Stars littering the sky with lights so bright you'd swear it was daytime. :3c
Attention duelists: Look at my hair!
One with a lot of hair, lol.
Better than nothing
YGOTABS reference
I lol'd
also
Though I hope they take the time to remake the game in 3D, you know?
we could additionally run a poll
I'm talking about the fact that the sun beats down really, really, hard here.
texas
In the south?
Especially since I like how OoT 3D looks
Yeah.
hair = wieght by sunlight?
Alabama isn't fun when you're a nerd.
The sun ain't that much of a problem unless you're not used to it. I lived a while in San Diego and it was freezin' there.
As my bro would sometimes shout for no reason: no more polygons
Not my point.
Didn't get anywhere past about 70-80F
8good thinking
my head can burn me because of how dark my hair is
same, that and I keep mine pretty long
Well what're you sayin' then?
I've lived my entire life here.
DCD and I are talking over each other. lol
Not my point not my point.
my hair is pretty long to
Wasn't directed to you.
IS your head caked with mud?
8we could put it up on the FB page and then link it during the announcements or something
I'm a might confused... ><
You know, I have the avalanche scene playing in my head right now.
Zen, don'tt you live in, like, Mane?
It what makes sense
kind of afc
Man, that was one of the most epic things ever.
you are so southern
:D
Or was that Zeke?
?
yes i live in mane
/me 6is listening to the fail of the peoples when they see xcal on MW2.
I get you two confused.
sorry Barry
I think it's a good idea
but yeah
the summers are hot and the winter harsh and freezing
z's
Sticking every episode of MLP:FiM on my cellphone.
xD
yeah Hipster, only thing is I'd rather
6I like the poll idea...
have the preview run first
yeah
Same here, except without snow.
04blah
04cya Roara >>
I don't suppose any of y'all have seen a filly named ColorSpectrum around here?
04(late hence the >>)
Well, actually LAST winter had some snow.
i had soooo many snow days 
I need more pony songs on my iPod.
8yeah, yeah, thats what i mean
Not lately, Skies.
thats why im still in school now
8we could run the preview during pre-show
8like right before the movies start
yeah, JUST before the movies
Or is he :O
8but after the EQD post goes up
but it has to be like
Lol.
8then link the poll
Oh, well that's a bit of a relief. I haven't been on in a while and she was supposed t'be drawin' my pony. :3c
We had a week off because we had a FOOT of snow.
8this /meta/ thread is too quiet...
are you a spy?
A foot?
NO WAI
Only a foot?
8people are writing text walls I'm pretty sure
only a foot?
I know.
lol
People here freak out.
when I actually get the dates to my vacation LOL
Snow's srs bzns in the south
thats because your town must not be prepared for snow
YA.
I've never seen snow before. Only ice...
And sleet.
last time florida HAD ANY snow
6I'm positive of it, Hipster.
was.... in... 1974?
Yeah.
1979.
No wait, yeah.
1974.
Forgot.
I was close, though.
same difference
And last time florida HAD negative numbers for temperature was 1877
:/
He is
sounds painful
1877!
God.
134 years ago
04o0o
sooo many dates
04*o-o
04where'd this conversation come up
I didn't know we had a /meta/ thread
1877 was a bad year
I'm heading there now
Boredom
4XD
8do you know like, ballpark estimate of your vacation
8?
it was called the year without a summer...
6We don't, DCD
04k
8its about something unrelated
6We're talking about a drama /meta/ thread...
ANd now we have too much summer XD
A year with a Winter.
Well it's not like it happened every day. It was just that once
04I thought you were somehow haxxing into me because I have Retro open up on another tab XD
8sprinkles and i have been commenting on the thread
soo we might have our polar opposite
Yeah, but every day in the winter her is like, 2 degrees.
Annoying.
The year without a winter
Maybe I was ;>
Coldest I ever had was maybe 20F
that said
*here
I've been thinking
we should probably find a way to grow bigger
Colders TI ever had was 40 to 60 degrees
considering how big this has gotten
Stupid Tenessee Valley.
Hottest was a blistering 132...
i like to have all seasons
and I think DinkyPage is starting to be a bit too restrictive
we need an actual page
8okay
thats why i like new england
6Yeah, at some point.
8i dont even know where to begin with that though
with actual HTML Code Junkies
Summer up here is being relatively cool this year.
We don't have fall or spring, lol.
/me 7is going to sleep early today.
7For FINALS tomorrow. o3o
In Florida there's 3 seasons...
yeah, still not necessary
May went from 20 to 90.
but I expect that with our growth
No winter
we might start getting like
Earlier this month it was around 107 for 4 days straight.
500 viewers during the coming weeks
pretty mucj
sounds unberable southernskies
guys question for you
At the beginning of May it got to 20.
what
I don't like Second Life, how about you?
At the end it was 94.
Wasn't too bad since I was inside for most of the time, but it was pretty bad.
I've never played
I was thinking about perhaps, proposing to the Ponychan admin to give us a /stream/ tab, but I'm kind of against that notion
dito
One time, Augustine got flooded
Secong Life is an embarrasment to Bronies everywhere.
I used to play all the time
And I couldn't assess my school
Ponyville is kind of making me curious, though
Me too
it was on a monday...
for the sole reason that I want this to stay as a "Neutral Ground" for Bronies
kind of like Sweden
hence, BronySTATE
6I think this should be a neutral ground indeed.
MC Ponyville.
I quit a while back, but bronyville is making me want to play again
If anything just to see what it is.
Problem fixed.
And hallways WERE flooded...
8good god, !!Twilight is throwing gasoline on this drama fire like nothing else
Play Minecraft.
EHHHH\
I do play minecraft. :3
Problem fixed.
8sorry, my attention is split right now
minecraft ftw
so school was closed for 4 days getting the water out and drying....
Minecraft has a Ponyville.
6And then the /meta/ thread went CRAZY
Yes, I know
seriously?
I built a town there
Quebuck XD
Wait, it does?
8well, i do think we should at least talk to !!Celestia about it
Ponification of Quebec
What's the server IP?
8maybe not specifically for us, but it seems like that would be a good board to have around
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_lL9F4wiOQ&feature=feedlik ponify this song
do it.
bloodisgood.org:25567
4 sum srs lulz
another idea is to ask Silverscreen to get working on a new banner. I think it's time to get one with a different feeling...sur, I think this one is great, but I think that for something like this, we need something a bit more minimalistic
8and we were kind of originally born out of Ponychan
Creepy. o.o
you have to ask Gachl in MC Forums
8I agree DCD
Man, those tornadoes back in April were only three miles away from my house.
6I agree aswell.
8i was actually going to ask him, but i know hes super, super busy right now
I want to make a virtual version of the grand galloping gala
Lol.
Rev
But I dont' know what I want to make it on
did you heard what I said?
let's wait for them to get some free time
What?
I had a HUGE flood back in 2003
Oh.
THat closed my school for 4 dayd
trying to get the water out
I can't remember 2003.
so we had only a 1 day weekday
I can I was 7
Not because I CAN'T, but because nothing memorable happened that year.
The hallways were flooded...
Jesus
6Just a little bit.
we couldn't open the class door
6But he was just basically attacked.
I want in
8im kind of ashamed i was defending him/her
class doors*
6And Twilight is always a bit of a prick.
Water is amazing.
8no, DCD, run far away from this
link me please, my browser is being a bitch
water pwns ass
11Rawr
8if you insist
8http://www.ponychan.net/chan/meta/res/13749.html
I like water. Water is pretty cool.
are you kidding? I'm a friend of justice. It's my job to deliver the hurt
it was like 4 feet amount of watter...
6I wasn't defending HIM, I was defending the idea.
At the end of the year this year, there was a full week, and then the weekend, and then the last day of school.
im not afraid
Hey, Anon1
That pissed me off so much.
nice
8i have never seen a mod openly call a user an asshole before
I knew it
sup Silver
Silver! Hi
and one foot of it flooded th school
8hi silver
The last day of school was a moday.
11What's going on?
the last thing a mod can do is take things personally
*monday
mine will be a teusday
hence why I'm glad with our current mod force
And some of the kids had a surfing contest....
none of us takes things personally
Keeps ups alive, can kill us pretty damn quick, too. Ahhh, irony.
should have known with the different colored text
8!!Twilight is trying really hard to get demodded right now
a mod must be cold as ice, and elusive as ether vapor
6I'd better get going..It's 4:22 am.. :P
4ok
4Bye
/me loves being an open brony.
It's so liberating.
6See ya tomorrow :P
8im a little afraid to post in this thread right now because i know im gonna say something rude to !!Twilight
8and i dont want to get banned
it's awesome
wooo
11TO be fair, Whelp's slowly become quite the pain in the ass to the mods.
Saw the article about SEcond Life. Man, SEth is gonna be overwhelmed there if he tries it out.
I don't think he has the time to try it out :P
wooooooooooooooo
I think Lauren has not only done a lot for girls by changing perceptions about "girls television."
But with all the guys that her show has attracted, done a lot for guys.
SUPER PONY CAN'T GO ON MY IPOD.
GAAAH.
8true, but !!Twilight has crossed so many lines in this thread
*Super Ponybeat
oh noes
D:
Why not, Revolver?
11That's one mod.
I'm so angry.
No room?
i know someone with it on thier i pod
I dunno, Itunes hates it or something.
Anything can go on an ipod.
11Granted some of the mods can be eccentric, but I'm not expecting them to be perfect.
It won't copy...
maybe its just you rev
Now I only have Asylum and a few Pendulum songs...
11I myself have had several but-ins with Spikemod because of how he's been hammering on the RPs that go on in /oat/
wek'
!pokemon
Kosoveon, you are a 11Octillery.
And some of the Chrono Cross OST.
Apple hates anything it can't control.
11But Everytime something "controversial" involving them comes, Whelp's there to throw accusations about the mod's.
I don't use iTunes.
Then again, I'm running Ubuntu 10.04. :P
Also, I can't get A Hard Day's Night on there...
I'm not that sad about this, because it's SO FREAKING LOUD, but still.
I use a youtube video rip website.
I love that song.
Same here.
damn it
my browser's acting up
It annoys me.
brb
K
and I can get it on an ipod, *shrug*
Ecept for Asylum, which I bought.
*Except
FINE, i'm going in to see if it is the hellhole that it's claimed to be!
*tlaking about SL*
I can get You Gotta Share and Cupcakes on there, but not At the Gala....
D:
oh lawdy
I've seen worse...
*looks to tribly* no offense.
12Hi Kosovo
are we still talking about music?
no
Anyway
I have the vocals for You Gotta Share, BTW.
well ish
It sound better.
ah
pwny music
*souns
*SOUNDS
lack of ipond pony music working
Linkin Park - In The End IS MY FAV
I can't correct myself today.
derp
Linkin Park is okay.
i added that to my ipod
a long time ago
SL is a hell hole depending on where ya go. You just find your niche, and go from there. I hang out with my friends in a couple places, and that's it, really.
In the End is SOOO OVERUSED, though.
and now i skip it when it comes on shuffle
EVERY TIME
I like it....
then take it off
yea...
SL is only really good if you already have friends on it. :/
i just hate deleting things
/me 11reads all of the OP
other than that it's a grief-fest
11Hmm...
But as everything else, it might get old...
im like an e-hoarder
11I gotta admit Soldier has a point.
Basicly, SomethingDifferent That right there helps a LOT.
yeeap
Okay, back.
And Oh dear, Second Life thinks it's too good for my Computer :/
6I'm not sure if I'm posting seriously or trolling at this point. Oo
It likes to take up a LOT of your resources.
8i disagreed with Soldier at first
4DX
Memory, HD page file space...
11I did to
8but seeing the way !!Twilight has conducted himself...
^ why people don't play it that much.
yea
8I'm really disappointed a Ponychan moderator would act that way
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTN2_QscIkw
ALTAIR
im off to play lots of mincraft
11Until I remembered how Spikemod's pretty much put RPing and Shipping in already-derailed /oat/ threads as Ban On Sight
I am LOVE MACHINE
have fun
I Come With a Message.
11I mul of ma cheen
i will

I have 2 gigs of RAM. Need to upgrade.
Wait...
Hm...
11What's the thread that Soldier is referring to, anyway?
There seems to be ISP-wide issues on my end atm
Like Oblivion.
Okay, MPR isn't on.
I can't put Oblivion on my CPU without using my Father's computer.
Get Windows 7 so I can have awesome pony icons.
/me has Windows 7.
Yes. Windows 7, because Vista sucks.
Alright everyone, I'm going to get going. Let ColorSpectrum know I was lookin' for her if you see her.
<-- Sucks...
/me hates the filing system of Windows 7.
Aye. I never grabbed Vista. Stayed on XP.
Same here.
Mostly because I didn't pick up a new CPU.
I feel bad for grabbing vista before windows 7 was invented...
If You dont Wish to Translate this Message, you best know that you will all perish at Midnight JST.
I had no experience with Vista. Bad as everyone said?
well.
Yeah it was.
Hasn't that already passed?
it's good for the first 2 years
It has a beef with Maplestory.
Like, ME bad?
This Binary Message is perfectly sound. it will translate to ASCII Text without fail
then let the hellstorm begin
FOr some it ran great. Others, not so much
Maplestory was the SHIZ back then.
Oh gods ME.
6lol Japan
11wow.
Do none of you wish to lear onf your impending doom?
When your anti-virus deletes your windows vista genuinity flag 4 times in a row and requires 4 factory resets, thats when you know it sucks.
6You realize that it won't properly decode due to starting with a 0, yes?
Yeesh.
X.x
Hahahaha
That's painful.
Lol
and the good avast antivirus too, not the crap
sirSprinkles. i have succesfully decoded my message ten times without fail
Yeah, I have Avast. WOrks well for me.
Sure that's not a problem with Vista?
Avast deleted Steam.
:P
aparently it is.

6And you don't have to be rude.
wass up?
Yo, Midnight
11Well, the thread in question that Twilight Mod locked doesn't even sound like a parasprite thread.
11It just sounds like somepony stating what they dislike about the fandom.
i Has A Question
11and hell, others were posting the same thing in response.
I may has an answer

Maybe Rainbow Dash Has An Answer

I don't get it.

XDD
Friendship is Magic, Silly Sprinkles
o nvm.
6You are truly the worst troll ever.
6You know we can see your hostname, right?
hmm?
11We chose mods based on how they interact with each other, particularly how they deal with parasprites and rule offenders.
Sprinkles, i just got on, that probably was my brother
Lol, you don't?
6If you say so.
I believe Midnight-Sparkle has been around from day one, if I'm not mistaken.
In any case, the easiest way would be to provide a talent or a resource we're looking for, or present a good idea you can help develop that might aid to the expansion and development of BronyState
I didn't at first, but then I googl'd wikipedia.

6Meh. I don't trust anything on the internet, so whatever.

i am an active participant in games, threads, and Friday Brony movie Night!
Oh. I get it now. *cross-eyed*
The blogger has a COMPULSIVE NEED to correct grammar, so she counters it like this:

/me 
tru dat
6I have seen the name, I'm just saying. I'm always skeptical, so... yeah.
As a grammatically conscientious person who frequents internet forums and YouTube, I have found it necessary to develop a few coping mechanisms. When someone types out "u" instead of "you," instead of getting mad, I imagine them having only one finger on each hand and then their actions seem reasonable. If I only had one finger on each hand, I'd leave out unnecessary letters too!
We need to change the password for this place tomorrow.
02Yes, I know the secret *-*
Skeptical Sprinkles is Skeptical :D
Hee.
okie dokie loki
11I think this is the first time we actually had someone come to us about becoming a mod.
someone typing out hole instead of whole makes me twitch.
6Not really.
8nah, i have had a bunch of people approach me about it
11Everyone else we just picked from the litter.
8btw

8before i forget
but right now, we're only looking mostly for two things: One, a permanent page to move to, so we'd need an HTML junkie, and two, streamers for the S2 Pony Episodes live, so you'd need The Hub as well as some capture card hardware (and failing to have the latter, be willing to fork out the cash to buy an EasyCap over the internet, although I gather they are quite affordable), PLUS a good PC, preferably a desktop with its own dedicate

It's MrLag right?
Alot is better than Michael Phelps at swimming.
6And Eurobronies, DCD

8Metal Link has offered to stream new MLP episodes for us once they start
I have the Hub, but not the second one
6We need it to be easier for Saturdays.
You act like you want her to go off on people for their grammar.
hey there level-headed hipsters
Alots are audible!
sure why not

They meow!
would rid the world of grammar nazi's.
11I'm available for Saturday streaming, so You know you'll have at least one mod on the job.
He has, Hipster?
Tell him we need to talk, cause that we do.
We have to test his gear.
It's Channel 139 for me
I see what you did there.
orly
You're not using your words right, people!
SgtLag Drop the period and space. :D
Orly is an airport in Paris
I'm amazed at how often people mess those two up.
sgtlag
oh snap
but if Metal Link can do it, great.
I got burrned
I see what you meant when you said it degraded into a mudfest.
no
I want
at least three live-capture episode streams

One more day of work tomorrow, then vacation starts.
!!Twilight was a little harsh with what they said, but I agree with locking the thread.

as to how to choose who streams for which episode, we could use the randomizer, we cycle them, or we choose depending on quality (slightly dickish)
Though frankly I put a lot of importance into quality, so I'm inclined to the lastest. Hence, before giving someone the position, we must study their internet speed and computer specs extensively.
in my case: I don't always get bored after racing, but when i do, PIES.

Duck... duck... ':D' ... BRICK!
*Robots gave us 6 extra seconds of friendship.* Ponies gives us 22 and a half extra Minutes of friendship.
how is that advice?
11And then we do a test streaming to ensure that we can get the best picture with the least amount of lag.

WHOOPS.
Lag, sorry.
8also ghosties, in case you missed it, !!Twilight is being a complete asshole
Just waiting on the editor to get another fic out too.
np, it really spoke to me ^_^ all that friendship nonsense and such XD
why you guys want RD as a lesbian...
Hehe "editor"
8but I wouldn't recommend getting involved
as in "dude who'll edit my brain droppings"
seems it works now
cause guys like yuri
this is much easier on the eyes
Oy..
http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/03/i-cant-feel-my-face.html
9much better
ZenEffy: I can assure you, there's girls out there who like yuri too xD
9it's hard to read colored text on the white background of my phone IRC client
pr0nies, thats wy
then it is no longer yuri
Oh god.
YES
4Twilight?
PR0NIES
4What's going on with !!Twilight?
8yeah
http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/02/please-stop.html
ZenEffy: Uhh, what's your logic there?
What's WITH you people?
RD isn't canon gay.
And besides, FS?
Really?
8Soldier made a post on /meta/ about !!Twilight acting unprofessionally
What's all this about
yaoi is direct toward girls, buri is the same thing for guys
Where did your obsession with AJ go?
Revolver: Chillax, I was messing
8i disagreed with him at 1st
I know, same here.
ZenEffy: The main audiences of both is female actually
umbreeeeeon tail
yaoi=buri the difference is who reads it
ZenEffy and co, can we keep that topic to #EquestriaAfterDark
8then !!Twilight came in, called everyone children and called Whelp an asshole, then left
i miiiissssed you
!umbreon
/me still belongs to Skylands for 0 more seconds
o-o
!umbreon
/me still belongs to Skylands for 0 more seconds
4Well
Revolver: Oh okay, sorry. Your arguments seemed serious face. I'm bad at reading between the lines
4Whelp is an asshole
4No argument from me
ZenEffy: You don't know what you're saying then.
8that may be true, but you cant act like that when youre a mod
6:D >mfw thread gets Derpy derailed
But seriously, where DID the obsession with AJ go?
INTERNET, I'M GONNA GET DERPY TO INVENT COMBUSTIBLE INTERNET THAT'LL BURN YOUR HOUSE DOWN!!!
Yaoi: dudexdude. Yuri: girlxgirl
8for great justice
buri is for gay guys its still like yaoi
[!umbreon vars reset]
4I admit that he shouldn't have called everyone children, that's not fair
11Post made in FB and Twitter account about recruitment.
there is a yuri equivilent
I was gone for 10 seconds and this happens?

4And possibly Twilight, I haven't gotten to him yet
SO HOW ABOUT DEM PONIES
Pix BONANZA
nah, they are otherwise......indisposed
but !!PinkiePie is cool, i chatted with her for a little bit today
RARITY'S A WHORE
...
Wait I'm not on afterdark
My bad
Okay here i are.
4I'll admit, I think Pinkie Pie is a little overzealous in her job sometimes but I definitely don't think she has a mean bone in her body
4So far from what I've seen at least
6SUDDENLY EVERYPONY
6OUT OF FUCKING NOWHERE

I came from FB

I hate windows vista.
vodka is illegal to minors

remeber kids
4Oh god
9on what we need and what we strive to accomplish
!!Derpy is cool to hang out with, but he gets a little aggressive on the board moving

Maybe he's in russia.
4This will be fun
That's what I meant by "uptight"
4Chickenmod is Assmod
then i tip my hat to his engrish
Remember pony dresses?
!!Scootaloo is occasionally funny, but mostly kind of mean
Okay.
Rarity is losing it.. an elegant pony like her shouldn't over do it.
9so basically, WALL OF TEXT

4Someone used to come on here with the name Duskfly. I really liked it
does anypony know what cable network has the Hub?
4Gotta be honest, I'm mostly skimming the meta thread so I can get to Twilight mod

4I have the Hub
right
ive had a few conversations with her/him

4: /
4Then how do you know it was Twilight mod?
9another thing
the way he phrased things
9I propose that the people that apply for Euro Mod Positions
9should be given Voice Access during a "probation" period to see if they meet the qualifications
I could tell as well.
Aulderbane
it's etna
this was the main post that got me upset:
there is one of yoko though
I skimmed through it, but I have agree with the assessment. Twilight was being a downright asshole.

Hey, i'm just sick of this flankhole waltzing all over the place, making accusations and snide remarks everywhere. Don't blame me, i'm just doing my job.
9by the way, Hipster
/me makes his spot check
8yeah?
Clever fox.
9have you seen the "make a Facebook ad" prompts?
Fun fact, applejack is alcohol
9I think we should make one

so you mean addicting right
Eureka! I figured it out!
6I was looking at that earlier. XD
Awesome, PsychicKid :3

There is approximately 21,770,912 seconds until season 2 on MLP: FiM.
OMG
and counting.
There needs to be a countdown

SOMEONE LINK ME UP ONE
11It requires money
XD
11I tried doing it earlier.
11It ain't free.
I did it using basic time trajectory and estimated completion times.
Man, I'm watching the ronies group react to Satch wanting to give SL a try. It's.....not good.
8yeah
The griefers are going to HOUND him if htey find him.
8i dont have any money to do an ad
stick a cupcake in your eye

i would.
4I see
11I got a $100 charge on my bank account.
4It's fine with me
http://lmgtfy.com/?q=countdown
the content may be correct
While I agree that Whelp has become a bit of a problem for the mods, I think !!Twilight was out of line.
but that's not how you act when you're a moderator
9Well shit
4Okay, I think it may have been unprofessional and unreserved of him but I completely agree with that post
!!Twilight was WAY out of line
9also
11So no-go on the ad.
that would help a lot in trajecting my times.

4...did you have to sell your xbox for food?
6There was a Bloodstar in here earlier.
6Not yet, Ghosties.
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_D_Z-D2tzi14/S9nwkvnBiKI/AAAAAAAAC2U/bbEYpwSRdjs/s1600/fakeproducts4(alternate).png
9damn
6Probably soon.
Huh. I'm going to keep playing this Pony Touhou.
4Man, god what a shit feeling
Until the release of S2
FUCK
4So come Wednesday we'll talk to them on a further basis
4What's wrong?
I FORGOT TO SCREENCAP THAT THREAD
11What question do you have for the canadian, eh?
I fucking knew it too
4Fear not, Hip. I still have the thread :D
can you cap it for me?
Cap what part?
4I don't know how to screencap a thread however
DANGUS INTERNET!
at least the part where !!Twilight posted?
Revolver, I'll make sure not to get into your shower anytime soon.
do you have vista?
9something Hipster sent me an email about earlier
It's an adventure.
6Alright, I'm out. Talk later guys.
9night Sprinks
cya
4No, I have Windows 7
9thanks for your hard work
8oh yeah
later
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_D_Z-D2tzi14/S839Uu_gRvI/AAAAAAAAC0E/9EbP68c5xO4/s1600/ER10.png
8about veemi getting blocked
oh neat
9I don't think Veemi is blocked in any country
Mac or PC?
Ah
9it might be their ISP
go to accessories
9or actually, their flash player settings
9not being updated
9the works
THere should be a button on the keyboard that says "print screen"
4PC
see if the "Snipping Tool" is in there
wa.
8yeah
4Yeah, I have the snipping tool
YES.
4But I've never tried snipping anything bigger than something that's smaller than a page
okay, open that up and then click and drag over the area
you can do it in small parts i guess
4You mean drag the cursor all the way down the thread?
4I'll try
11Of course the villains start showing up TODAY instead of YESTERDAY -_-
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/26116
no, just to cover the part of the window
this happens too much
fuck
i just realized
9in any case
wat?
9sent them a message in EqD
lol
9they will hopefully see it
define: "too much"
/me rawrs
!!Twilight posted as anon, so there would be no way for !!Celestia to validate it came from him from a screencap
all the time
11DCD, we were thinking of having the potential EuroMods come in on Wednesday for a brief interview
Hee hee.
oh girls just jelly because we are getting all the attention.
It's kinda heresay no matter what.
OH!
4I couldn't just drag the cursor down :(
yeah
Get a screencap of the LOCKED post.
Fox news, remixes, websites....
yep but i dont see why they are surprised so much in this chat too
9sounds good
if the thread still existed, !!Celestia could have checked the IP or whatevs
9however
THe fox news thing was funny, not enraging. people are too serious :I
dont worry about it ghosties
Maybe because of the website banner? :) ^^
9keep in mind that also means that we need to set an interview time
it doesnt matter
9sadly I won't be home till like 6 PM EST on Wednesday
Can someone fill me in on the Fox News thing? Did they do a report on "bronies" ?
/me rawrs.
but older girls watch this show too
8works for me
Kinda sorta.
4I'd actually want to screencap for purpose of having it for future reference and lol
they did 2 reports on bronies.
Red Eye is not-so- serious stuff
9oh yeah I should get to work on the BMN RD-Network page now
11By then it'd be too late. It'd be, what, 11:00 for them?
and dissed us both times calling us "people who don't go to work just to watch MLP."
9I'll name it "BronyState" instead
02How can a Leafeon rawr?
-quote.
apparently Soldier requested that the thread be deleted
9considering the fact that we might host S2 streams and all
so it wasnt !!Twilight being sinister
>download SL
thats good to know
>go to pony area
>See Actionhank
STill not enraging.
9well, bu that logic, we should also change the FB Page name
oh, good.
9but in any case, working on it
theres no profit in SL.
4Wait, !!Twilight wasn't the guy who said the thing about Whelp?
NPR always hinted at living in mom's basement and being unemployed
>_>
8we went with Brony Movie Night in FB because that's what people will search
yes, he was
im not raging cause i know fox new is too stupid to know better and im not included in this group XD
as far as we know
9I'll also make posts related to mod recruitan and Streamer searchan' in RD-N
9who here also has RD-Network?
wha-?
Ding Ding
9I might need group adminin' help
because rawr.
but the thread was deleted at the request of the OP, not because !!Twilgiht was trying to cover his tracks
8i dont lol
02Makes sence.
8i know nothing about it
Fox News
can't get their facts right.
ORLY?
The problem is that !!Twilight posted as Anon, so just a screenshot isn't proof enough.
/me yawns and goes to sleep on Leafeon's head
every news cast can't get it straight.
ello
THEY FUDGIN' CAN'T
nope
hey RD
Fox news is the worst offender.
and all that was directed only at the guys
Which is irony.
4Well, it seems Twilight knew what he was doing when he posted as anon
*starts political flamewar*
You become vaguely aware that something isn't right when a feeling of uneasiness engulfs you like a dark, suffocating fog. You realize that you are going to need a sandwich.
11I never even heard of it until yesterday.
'cause Fox was supposed to be 'The answer' to the radically left media.
Fox is stupid
>get hosted on fox news
>Love & Tolerate the crap outta' them
>get hosted some more
Yes,because the left is so radical.
That lesbian said it.
Radical has more than one meaning, but I digress.
<RD> Fox is stupid
And the mass media is extremely centrist.
what lesbian
That lesbian said it right.
XD
i didnt watch the whole report
Lets not care what Fox thinks guys, they are wrong over half the time anyways
Did Fox do something bad again? Or are we still whining about the first two.
Haters gonna hate.
how this chat and EAD should be: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RLm9t-hOPo&feature=player_embedded
Parasprite's gonna Parasprite.
any leftward bias is most probably due to the fact that journalists have gone through college, and people with degrees are, on average, more left-leaning.
they see me buckin, they hatin
lolz
Next up: Bronies are just as bad as furries! ..*duckhideflee*
>implying furries are bad
/me is considered fine to watch MLP
That's unfair to everyone.
Exactly.
Im cool with furries.
They will imply that. I'm fine with furries, too.
http://xkcd.com/471/
4I'm screencapping certain posts I felt were important
im fine with furrys but i dont want bronies to get a bad rep like furries
http://img28.imageshack.us/img28/9721/bearchipscomposite.png
RD: too late :>
hahaha. I love that one.
cool.
xD oh XKCD
are females still con sidered 'bro'nies?
RD that would only happen if the cosplay follows the horse-like style...
Eeyup.
12bbl
Lurkingear: need I link the RD cosplayer?
females are fillies
no
GET IT RIGHT
or i'll make you a pie
According to you, Flame.
cool, it will probably be worth it to get at least some evidence however circumstantial
A TASTY ZenEffy FLAVOR PIE
...
9here, group is made
:s
so females cant be bronies
My girlfriend uses "Bronie".
is !!Celestia's email admin@ponychan.net?
9I'll post a notice http://rainbowdash.net/group/bronystate
9also
9Silverscreen
9we were meaning to ask you something
bro stands for brother
so yeah.
they can't
awwwwwwwwwww
11Yessir?
they refuse to be bronies... but want to be...
what am i then
Pfff,doesn't mean nothin'.
so i got an external hard drive
while on vacation
lopl
Females are bronies.
Brony is a term for the fandom, last I checked.
its like calling em dudes
what happened in here I'm lookin' for cool pics
wooo
I call girls dudes all the time.
XD
:P
But NOBODY seems to agree on whether or not it applies to girls too. Which I think is stupid.
i rather use the term dudette
Brony is just a general term for older fans of MLP.
4I don't know. In any case, aside from my own screencaps, what posts in particular do you think I should screencap?
Zen are you a girl?
yep
Obviously.
...
Brony is also a small village in poland
eyup
i herd that
why i treated you like a dude?
Heee.
consistent of 80 people
Lirkingear
doesnt make much of a diference
^
WE MUST INVADE POLAND
:Q
The LOCK post in the other thread
WWIII, anypony?
A Brony is an older person who likes MLP, regardless of Gender.
So, girls are, in fact, Bronies.
^like
The one post that caused the /meta/ thread to happen.
9we were wondering if we could ask for your creative talents once again
sweet
People in Brony are also apparently Bronies.
11Sure.
HELL YEAH
WWI was for... vengeance?
WW3 :D
9because maybe a more minimalistic banner for BronyState would work better
pretty much all of !!Twilight's posts
They might call themselves Bronites.
WW3 => MW3
that sounds cool
then WW2 was for hitlers hate
WW1 was for.
yeah
Everything => MW3
it was vendetta
9something sleek, streamlined, attractive, yet eye-catching
revenge
Everything>cod
WW3 is for love and tolerance >:D
9preferrably monochrome
True, MPR
Then suddenly Dari out of fucking no where.
COD is just bleh.
http://images.cheezburger.com/completestore/2011/4/28/14453dd6-d545-44f5-b037-21a6df0b75d2.jpg
WW1 was for revenge, WW2 was for power madness
11AH! *fryingpan to Dari's face*
WW3 is for PONY CONQUERING
i prefer zelda over first person shooters
8DAT BACKGROUND ON THE BRONY STATE RD NETWORK PAGE!
I think there was a bit of revenge in WW2 as well.
WWI was for fear, WWII was for revenge, WWIII will be for the Princess!
WW3 will definitely be over the interwebz.
11How about the Ponyville shot behind the Ponies?
Confounded pony chat, I can't pulll myself off to do other things.,
Retsamoreh yeah, pearl harbor an all
for we cannot survive without it.
like sleep?
11Monochromed to B/W without said ponies?
Meh, who needs sleep. Ponies are about.
4Luckily for you guys I still had the other troll thread up where Twilight said what he said
Sleep is in a couple hours. It's only 11pm.
Sleep?...Whats that?
It's that thing that.. uhh
My drama-sense is tingling.
well ****.
awesome
you're the man
sleeping makes luna sad D:
What's a sleep?
i should sleep now, i have finals tomorrow
4I want to make something clear though
What's a sleep?
good night every pony
it doesn't take the most powerful nations on earth to start the next global conflict
G'Night.
gnight
seeya Zen
just the will of a single brony.
I wanted to play some Lufia 2 before sleep. A Let's play by HC Bailey has me starting a new game again.
G'night
4I do NOT want to catch ANY shit for what may happen
=D
QHatr?`/
Nini Zen
G'night Zen
dont worry
night zen
I love HCBailey.
HCBAILY
ill use my name
AND LUFIA 2?!?!
yes.
Not really.
But I've heard of it.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qruO7SCO0FA&feature=related
3,094,322 seconds to premiere of MLP: FiM S2.
He played Lufia 1 earlier, now he's ontto 2
So, mods being assholes seems to be the topic?
i dont think seth's posted this yet
9Sounds good, I'd like to see what you could bake
specifically !!Twilight
9that said, a base-color font for the title might be good, as well
...i demand more pony metal >: D
Oh hell yes.
HCBAILLY FTW
11You don't like the rainbow for our logo? :P
pony-metal win
How HCBailly has so much time for letsplays is beyond me.
HC Bailey is awesome. <3
But I enjoy em'.
9it's not that I don't
He's nice.
!!Twilight giving shit because someone was questioning their judgement.
nice?
9it's just that, consider the rest of the page, which is pretty, well, black
It really doesen't take that much time to do it.
Yes. Nice.
he's entertaining.
but do you like it or love it?
11That's the point. It stands out.
9what I'm trying to say is, we should try to make it look more fitting with the all-black bg
yes
...don't start this
THIS TOPIC IS OVER.
X3
tel me!
11Is it really that distracting when we have a stream up?
9well, yeah, it's good for it to stand out, but I think we should make it stand out in a different way
he called basically everyone in the thread a child, and then specifically called Whelp an asshole
Does anyone have skype?...
11Ah, I see where you're getting at.
Tell me! tell me!! tell me!!!
<-<...
9nah, I'm just saying we should try making it fit with the theather theme more
Lawl, sounds like a great moderator.
I think it's ok
*Trying to segway*
11ooooohhhhh
neva
okay.mpg
you could always make the bg match the rainbowness :/
im going to report him to !!Celestia
: /*
11soisoisoisoisoisoi
lol
9hence why I suggested a monochrome title...that way you could use a solid color, like, say, purple, to make it stand out
11actually, the eyeroll seemed appropriate there, Soi.
because it was EXTREMELY unprofessional
5.....Now that was good TV.
ehh, if you want
11if you were being sarcastic.
lol
9Well Soi, keep in mind that
I was
Star Wars 6 was better...
9a. Black gives the page a "lights-out" feel
Just glad to know others know of him <3
yes, I know. I wasn't serious
and honestly, if any of our mods here acted like that, they would be gone
9b. It also helps save the viewer's electricity! Conscious About the Environment Ranger!!
5But SW6 was epically amazing.
and we aren't even as "professional" as Ponychan
Uhhhhhhhhhh
5And it was a multi-million dollar film. =P
Mind if I share me as a pony?
5LOT more money than a cable series.
4Again, I completely agree with !!Twilight's comment on Whelp.
Go for it.
11I'll come up with a few designs to show you on Wednesday.
4But that's beside the point, I know
gimme a sec P:
Yup XD
show yurself!
9awesome
9thanks yo
9that said
ihghinioppjhjbrgarhgaerhae ryhaery
9Hipster_Brony
tried to type fast with one hand
yeah
03and it's on TV :P
didn't worked.
9has the order for the showings on Friday been selected?
http://i349.photobucket.com/albums/q368/michaelmon13/Michpony.png
just because its true doesnt mean you can say it
11Holy hell. This is my first legit request. WHOO!
http://i349.photobucket.com/albums/q368/michaelmon13/poniess.png
8yes and no
8we have it tentatively, but I want to change it
8because
5But it was made like twenty years ago or more. :P
8right now, we have both our movies in the 2nd half of the broadcast
03so/
03?
8and i dont want people to sit through 2 movies with no intermission
03I was made 20 years ago too
03o.o
velociraptor: is that a juicebox as yer cuitemark?
9I see. I wanted to post it in the RD-Network group though
The mod's point isn't the problem. It's how they behaved. I also agree with what TWilight said, but that was not cool.
Good eye.
Yeah um sw was made waaaaay long ago
you wanna hear what I don't like about Hc Bailey?
5(actually SW was probably more like 25 but um whatever.)
1983ish
5Point is you can't compare movies to TV.
He's always drunk,
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp_K8prLfso&feature=related
Almost 28 years
:D
He sounds unentertaining,
5THAT WAS ONE YEAR AFTER SIGNALS WAS RELEASED BY RUSH. /shot
He is not funny when he does lets play's
9also the FaceBook page has a poll feature
9which is awesome
11Yeah. Not only does it give viewers a break, but it gives Mods a chance to rest between movies as well.
You can but its not a good idea
He always sounds cheezy when he talks
/me runs
I'm unimpressed with him
5Exactly ^
5Not a FAIR comparison.
he has too many caps in his name
11You thinking of putting a poll up in BMN?
8heres what i think we should do
His cheeseyness is the best part!
9however, we should probably make it an off-site poll
he uses an emulator, not the real thing
9for people who don't have FB
Opinion noted.
and he doesn't do anything that is challenging.
"Q_Q"
but, whatever you think is fine.
8spiders web, feeling pinkie keen, se7en, fall weather friends
9Silverscreen: I want to gauge interest in a non-Movie Night broadcast
Indeed. :3
9namely, of playing Kojima's SNATCHER
9which is by all extents and purposes, an amazing interactive movie
11so you want to stream outside of BMN events, like what Sprinkles did yesterday with that marathon of Kenan and Kel.
03so how about
03Terminator: TSCC was probably better
9pretty much
03:D
11That was fun.
this is the part where you see Rarity's Face in complete awe and everything is silent.
9we'll also notify the viewers of these off-schedule streams
The what?
Has anyone heard the "Psychoshy Battle" by Renard?
5Naaaaaah, I'd disagree.
03Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles
5I wasn't too impressed with that.
03amazing TV miniseries made about Terminator
I have, but never saw it.
03then you suck :|
Okay
Sarah connor-
9via the FB, Twitter, RD-N pages, the mailing group, and finally, during BMN themselves
Yeh
5And again, robots, not aliens.
03the first season, at least, was amazing
11It'd be good to have a set time for them so that we aren't bombarding their emails with the new streams.
03I have both seasons on DVD
5It got canceled anyways.
/me 5runs
03I should get the Blu-rays
03that would be cool
9yeah
03and hey
/me sees rarity's face in complete awe and everything is silent
03who's to say this show won't get cnaceled
5LIKE ALL MY OTHER FAVOURITE TV SHOWS. O^O
5It's on cable. Less chance of cancellation.
'But I thought you -wantd- whining?!'
03not really
Well, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfy5W8AJqIY&feature=related. Don't be fooled by the beginning 16 seconds.
miss rarity, please stop! what would cereal think if he knew?
can we skip scenes in here or do I need to drag Lauren Faust into this chatroom to make everyone go OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG
03speaking of which I saw about 50 TNT channel operators today.
5Actually, less competition and less dependence on advertisers making choices compared to broadcast because people pay for television.
5How do you think USA manages to hang onto its shows for so many years? (;
5The only reason The Dead Zone and The 4400 got canceled was because of the Writer's Strike.
11....
03USA has shows?
03I was aware all they showed was movies and syndicated stuff
5Uh, YEAH.
11so we need to figure out a set time.
5OMIGAWD
SO. 20 million before Season 2 opens?
8ok guys, i gotta get some sleep
03and like, wrestling and crap
5BEST DRAMAS ON TELEVISION

11Dari, I'm surprised you're up so late.
that's the goal
03My roommate's gf liked that show

03I watched one episode
11er, early
03and was like o_O
Haha.
03Psych looks stupid.
we celebrate 20m with ep 1
5But Dule Hill~ D:
Hi again, guys.

11Hi, Barry.
03also
03>Fangirling
5Shawn's partner! (He plays Gus.)
03= no
11That's cool.
Of course we'll hit 20m before S2 begins.
but I don't want to get everyponies hopes up.
5That is not fangirling.
Sorry I was away. I had just finished watching DBGT episode 64
Hell, at this rate, 30 isn't out of the question.
03liking shows because of an actor? That's pretty darn close
It was bad quality
03with T:TSCC they were all "With that one girl from 300" and I wa slike who?
5That is freaking out over a legitimately good show in a world of stupid reality TV.
03completely different type of acting LOL
3,093,617 seconds until premiere of S2 of MLP:FiM
03in 300 she was naked, she's not in Terminator
/me runs
"Brony Blue"
DBGT! HAH
I was trying to remember this song
5And for the record it's an ensemble cast. I like the whole cast.
5I like the writing.
5I like the script.
5I like its originality.
O_O
03heh
03well
So does anyone have a problem with the filter kicking instead of muting? If we added how to rejoin the channel to the kick message, rules, possibly topic, etc?
5And I feel the same way about all the other shows on USA.
03usually I just like the plot
03generally
I got the DTs, bad. I need more pony.
03stuff on USA sucks unless it's a movie
thats 3000000 too long
03at least from what i've seen
5To each his own. (;
03same with TNT, really
9well
well, that is interesting
9with "Off-Schedule"
03it's all OMFG WTF IS THIS WRESTLING BS
9I kind of mean
5Leverage?
Just mass voicing/unvoicing is pretty inconvenient.
03now, they show NASCAR, which was cool because I was ther.e
9"Not at 7 PM EST Friday"
8apparently the original thread that caused !!Twilight to blow up wasnt even a parasprite thread :D
apparently, if you click MLP:FiM you will freeze the chatbox
interesting indeed.
5I think Leverage is epic. But that's just me.
11I figured that.
?
Ohai Hipster.
9as in, they are aired at times which might not be "regular"; but they WILL have a set time
hmmm
8anyway, with that im gonna go for realz
hullo
8see you guys tomorrow
5And now I must poof again as much as I'd like to continue this little debate with you. :C
happy evening
Cya, again. XD
5Graaaah.
hello fellow brony.
curiosity. it has been gained
cya
11Cya
hi Night
Time for that sleep thing. Later this week, Count all bronies at Anthrocon! Oh gods.
9night Hi-damn
11ha
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY4vwWSK3sI wooot
9also Silverscreen: this is what I'm thinking of streaming first http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuyUShtcn94
rofl
11You're too slooow!
gnight Aulderbane
11SEGA!
night
My god, that reminded me of one of Sonic's Taunts in SSBB
Nini~
BOOM(f)ER
11Barry: http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii12/REexpert44/thats_the_joke.jpg?t=1272403278
?
Jazza: cool youtube link bro.
11So it's an interactive video of sorts?
/me fgdsjksfghrejgfg LIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINK
9an interactive movie
AGREED
9by Hideo Kojima
9and it's Amazing
11that's awesome.
11XD
nice Jazza, nice
IT
IS
I want to play F zero GX now
PERFECT
11This reminds me of Starship Troopers.
Play the original
11...
play it on SSBB for 1 minute demo
F-Zero for the SNES
11and now it's sounding like some Terminator BS.
My super nintendo is borken :(
nintendo y u no release new f-zero?
11INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS OMG!!!
Don't you just all love storms?
Having one here.
because this stole their thunder: http://www.wipeouthd.com/
03who, me? :D
/me hides
I'd love a new F-Zero
I love the sound of thunder
hai Danny oxo
11So when does the interactive part come in?
Storms are pretty relaxing, IMO
Storms are awsome
curiosity. it has been gained
I'm Gabe Newell.
srsly cptain falcon needs some updating before the new smash comes D:
SomethingDifferent laaaaaame it's for the PS3
No
OOT3D > DRF
U mad?
4Okay, listen, I've screencapped all the important bits I think need to be screencapped but I don't think I'm gonna go through with this. I seriously DO NOT wanna get in the middle of what could potentially be a large shitstorm. I hope you guys don't think any less of me, but it's wayyyyyy too easy for people to find out where the screencaps came from
people got it for free if they had a PSN acc
XD
...well THIS is a new feature.
4Even if Hipster says he'll take the blame
9it comes after the intro, duh
?
A new F-Zero? Where!?
http://www.wipeoutHD.com/
9it's part interactive movie/part visual novel/part lightgun shooter
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HejyAiZYXI
9oh, and a sequel might be coming soon
11awesome.
HeatWave exactly TT^TT
12XD
03yes
03I am
03>:|
9since during E3, a poster for "Snatcher - Episode 2" was spotted in the Konami workspace
Take the blame for what?
11Now will you be streaming gameplay or vids like this?
9gameplay
9the full game
They should be able to take criticism.
9it's not very long
I need to make a Brony Blue of the Big Blue GX theme.
9it's around 5-6 hours
you all suck
9I've already streamed it before
Tornado producing storms, even?
>_>
Hipster wants to report !!twilight to !!Celestia for being a douche
9it's one of those movies/games you want to pick up and play every couple of years
For a movie, it's long. For a video game, it's short.
9which is funny
I just love to run around in circles in the parking lot at night with a tornado warning and the pegasi ponies throwing thunderbolts at me. Quite Invigorating.
Too bad, since OOT3D is closer to LL
11That sounds fucking awesome.
9because I'm not the type to replay or rewatch movies
Than you :D
9well
/me shot
who doesnt?
9I could stream an Act a day
9the game is made up of three Acts
9also, after that
cool
9I'll stream the spiritual sequel, Policenauts
11How long is each act?
9it all depends
11Depends?
9 2 hours I'd say, except for the last one, which is a bit shorter
You too
11Are we talking about Chat being involved as well?
:D
Are you crazy?! /Twilight Sparkle
yes yes
11or just you playing?
/me 12sighs tho
OoT 3D
<With Ponies, you get 6 moar seconds of Friendship.*
<3
/me is playing it now
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYf64O-tsy4
12D:<
9just me playing, but I meant, "it all depends as to how far the chatgoers wish to go"
12MIEN
BAM
The ponies would not please the administrator.
12how far r u?
9if they want me to keep going once Act 1 is done
Ponies gave us 6 extra seconds of friendship
9we'll keep going
good job ponies
4I know that but I seriously don't want any kind of banhammers falling on me for doing seedy work
goron city
9so it might be done in one sitting
9or two
I just started playing
9or three
11ah.
9as I said, it's pretty much an interactive movie
lol
12you're further than me ._.
/me 12only played it for 10min
9so it doesn't give you THAT much freedom
All the ponies in this town are crazy.
12and nao playing it again
wb aurora
12hai Roara
4Say it is Twilight mod that said all those things, whose to say he doesn't find out that I was the one who caught him with his hand in the cookie jar and then swiftly boots me out of Ponychan
"You have disappointed me with your friendships!"
nice
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RLm9t-hOPo&feature=player_embedded
This crazy?
How would he find out?
Since we've seen the mane cast break down, what if literally every pony is going insane from a dark secret, like the shadow over innsmouth
11Sounds cool.
lon lon ranch theme <3
Nightboomfer...
I want that youtube song to play when i turn on my phone, my TV, my lamp, my computer, my door, and my wife.
the internet happened
12lol
11We just need a time to do it so that everyone knows when to show up.
9some gameplay http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbKmDzHXc0E&feature=related
9I'm thinking a Saturday
11Saturday is when we do the Eurostream.
12STFU Kaepora Gaebora >_>;;;;;;;
what, too soon?
Fanon goes to weird places between seasons...
6so is OoT3D amazing?
4I don't know, but I wouldn't put it beyond him
12YUSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
yes
6lol
11The gameplay is a lot like Ace Attorney...
True.
quite
12everythings polished and the 3D MAJORLY adds to it
04hi LL
04and nice
04I want eeeeeet
12and every aimable weapon uses the motion-sensetivity as Face Raiders does
04NICE
12and hai Chime
04... X3
BBL.
All you need to do is E-mail the pictures to Hipster and everything would point to him. He's the only one of us who posted in the forum, he'd be admitting to taking the screenshots, and he'd be the one to send the email.
bye
what is this? and why do I want to get it
OMG I so want OoT3D :D
Running second life and would like to free up resources for it.
I found a cute comic that is unrelated to the current discussion
12btw
11NewDCD that reminds me.
12as promised
9except it has a lot of voice-acting-talking
9also, dat voice acting in 1994
04?
11Thanks for getting me addicted to that fucking game.
/me 12DID get the first copy |3
04xD
6LOL
Man, Drawfriend was really good today

6legit

03OK so

03at a store
^
03to get it
03o.o
Well I'm going to bed.
BBL
12fail
12no
Apple Bloom, Pinkie Pie, Applejack, and Big Macintosh
yeah it was
4I just don't like getting my hands dirty
12its a Club Nintendo thing
I didn't mind the OC drawfriends too much
04k
well gotta go now
heh Im at Zora's domain in teh VC Version of OoT XD
03uh
03wait

03so you get it for registering your game?
bye
what soundtrack tho?
yes
and doing a survey
Well.
/me already got his ordered :D
50 tracks ftw
You may have to open it in a new window to view it
.....
This isn't so much as being seedy as it is performing a civic duty. Twilight showed that they might not be the ideal mod they might have been once before, and I agree with Hipster on reporting them.
can someone tell me what soundtrakc please? x-x
or tab, if you're using Firefox
to OoT 3D
03I dunno but it's prolly already leaked :P
*clop*
hallo
well
it's a club nintendo offer
hello
I need this soundtrack
yay
lol
9Edgeworth and Kay. Shipping. Because I'm a fag like that.
nvm, lost it
My name is Earl
for RN
*Snickers*
6is the soundtrack different from the original one?
somehow
Nice to meet you Earl welcome to the herd
6minus the fire temple...that was all drama
11I don't remember Kay for some strange reason...
i think there are some added tracks
11I just played the game a couple of hours ago.
C'MON MAMMA
04you mean fire temple?
not much other than that
O'COCKLE
My name is awesome. :3
6I said fire temple lol
04oh
9she appears first in Case 3
yea okay
04I misread as first XD
agree
6lol
04"There is chanting IT MUST BE OFFENDING US"
04>.>
9you might just not be that far
9plus it has spoilers
which game?
9I'll show you when you finish the game
6that chanting was so amazing though
9Ace Attorney Investigations
Possum Face :>
6I LOVED that temple FOR that song
04people will complain about ANYTHING.
04and yes
Indeed.
04it was amazing
11I'm on the last case.
11Rising from The Ashes.
My name is Gabe Newell.
Hopefully it will have been worth the weight.
Uh no
03I thought it sounded annoying myself but I'm all for not being politically correct
11Tell you what, them cases get intense.
4Okay, listen, Soldier started that thread with the intent of professionalism yes? That meaning that mods conduct business in a orderly fashion with reserve and restraint. Soldier himself displayed that kind of professionalism when he refused to give names on who did the rude lock post.
.......
I'm gabe newell
9oh
My favorite class is the spy.
03hence why I love the unedited version of Savages, and Arabian Nights
Hi
Oh man are you a face stealer?
or like a mimic
9certainly you won't remember it
Wait waht....
wtf is going on?
let us sit here for the next 2,094,112 seconds for the release of S2 in MLP: FiM.
9Ace Attorney =/= Ace Attorney Investigations
I've been on this site 199999664 times and I never noticed this here talky box.
9I'm referring to the game you play as Edgeworth
I win
You Didn't? :D
4Do you think it'd be the best of US, as mods ourselves, to really sink to the level that !!Twilight did and go behind his back and try to get him reprimanded?
9you should
same here.
12brbs
9probably play in this order
04k
Yes i do
Kosvoeon, once you get this soundtrack cd can you upload it
talky box
ha
same, until I found it
Well now I feel less derpy.
Welcome to this talky box PossumFace
9AA > AA2 > AA3 > AAI > Apollo Justice
now my life is slipping away slowly...
thought it was blocked advertisment from my adblockplus.
seeing as i dont have a 3DS or OoT3D
So, who here is getting MW3, but already owns Black Ops or MW2?
Point. However, if we were someone on Ponychan and saw that someone was paraspriting the hell out of somepony else, what would we do?
4There were plenty of people posting in that thread, whose to say someone didn't already screen cap it
I just never scrolled down.
Time to find that TF2/Pony crossover pic
lol
you wanna know life slipping away slowly?
LOSER
No love for me?
I need to find AA2 and AA3 I have AJ and I need to find AAI so that I can actually play it
BattleField 2 bish
*Battlefield 3
3,092,356 seconds to premiere of S2 of MLP: FiM.
fixed
Somepony most likely did. Doesn't mean they'll report it.
and counting.
9AAI is hard to find
9or so I hear
ok
How many days is that exactly?
11Ah.
thing is
9Capcom didn't distribute it too well
35 days.
it doesn't ship till like July 3
/me 11is using a ROM to play it.
:3
really?
and I'll be away for like a month on a family trip
Uh no
oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh
What proof you got?
858 hours
51538 minutes
so I won't actually be getting it till like early August
11AAI was the one you were streaming, yes? Involving the investigation on the plane?
Welcome to MLP: FiM Season 2
after 2 months
11With the grape juice.
that was a month ago
hopefully it was worth the wieght
;o'
Oh my, it's Gabe Newell!
season 2?
how bout LL then XD
525, 600 miiinutes
i want it
since MLP:FiM stopped on May 6th
4We can't literally point the finger at !!Twilight and go "all those anon posts were him!" because we don't know
i can wait to get it early july or till someone leaks it onto the internet
aaand I just screwed many ppl over who just clicked that link
When is Episode 3 being released?
9yes
9precisely that one
Uh
I thought S2 was premiering in August/September
Valve time or normal time/
I demand to know!!
Actually, we do know.
We are currently not working on it
As of April 2011, a second season was confirmed and is currently in development. Twenty six episodes from this season are set to be completed by December 2011[3], but other information, including the premiere, is currently unknown.
Thanks to the very post mentioned in this chat.
9also Apollo Justice was released before AAI, but AAI takes place earlier in the timeline, for all that it matters
On a relative scale, our time preferably
Oh, you Silly Nilly. There was something saying Valve is heading towards Multiplayer games from now on.
S2 premieres 2 months after S1. on average
Bye!
i would help if I could ^^;
Oh, that's too bad.
4Which post?
but those mp3s will be readily available soon anyways
*brandishes a knife*
lol
Now to kill the wait
They'll finish Episode 3 whenever they feel like it.
:o
Same with Black Mesa
*slices an apple*
It's not good to rush it.
...
When they feel like it
Left 4 Dead 2: Episode 1 will come out
"Hey, i'm just sick of this flankhole waltzing all over the place, making accusations and snide remarks everywhere. Don't blame me, i'm just doing my job."
oh don't you know?
"I'm just trying to do my job"
Valve can't count to 3
with 5 new maps
it's like duke Nukem's release date
"when it's done"
S2 MLP: FiM set parameters 2011/07/25 18:30 on http://www.7is7.com/otto/countdown.html
So, who here is actually going to buy MW3, yet owns any of the previous games.
and 9001 new special infected
This points to it being Twilight, since Twilight is the mod that's being questioned throughout the thread.
I'll buy Minecraft instead.
4They were all anonymous
Uh no
heh good. cause i really wanna be the first DJ to get my hands on this soundtrack XD
Ivan
I hope NO ONE buys
9oh by the way, Silverscreen
But the content of the posts makes it clear.
did i showed you my drawing with my open helmet?
It's the same game....
No, Gordon. It's not worth your time.
9your emulator better have microphone support
I have minecraft
leaving, see ya bronies
No Flame
9cause you're gonna need it for that case
bye
cya
I hate ponys
if you play lon lon ranch I will be like the FIRST one to tune in ;P
11o.o
I have minecraft. Imma get Terraria too.
GTFO
11That sucks.
9if you're using No$GBA
They're both good
9there's nothing to worry about
troll
MC is more creative though
but we wuv you
11I don't have a mic.
also i just found an OoT Remastered Soundtrack
Terraria has better combat
9you can emulate it, I believe
9you just need it to blow
embrace the tolerance
trudat
11ah
9there are workarounds.
hopefully 1.7 Mc update fixes that
ok
:D
you suck at changing names
...
I can c dat
You suck at sucking
:3
Perhaps
That's a compliment though righ?
WELCOME TO APPLELOOSA!
but everyone gets to yell at you in the end
for delaying episode 3
4No it doesn't, if anything, it makes it sound like Scootaloo because Scootaloo is also a jerk. The posts were made anonymously, that means !!Celestia, nor anybody for that matter, could find out which mod said it because the person hid behind anonymity. I don't think you can find out who made those posts simply from a screen cap either.
Fooby!
Well i gotta go
See you tomorrow everypony
6ZREO?
bye
Meee!
I mean Hi
Wemember me?
So has anyone done Ghost Recon ponies yet?
And that I do
What about HL2 Ponies?
ZERO?!
O.o
omg no
6I love ZREO
no
no
no
I want ghost recon ponies, that would like awesome.
Oh, ah..
Got a problem, mate?
Ghost Recon ponies? OoOoh.
ok, stop imposing at people from Valve and watch this
12FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFS why isnt the confirmation email showinmg up?! >_<
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E26PHTskO6U
12-m
I could totally do a forum sig if someone were to vectorize some.
omg Zekes did something
*stare*
9Silverscreen http://www.nogba.com/no$gba-microphone.htm
I really, REALLY want Ghost Recon ponies now.....
... I'm tempted.
Oh so very tempted.
4...actually, !!Twilight made a mod post in the thread
Of course it loops
eyup
And I REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY want a forum sig of said ponies
Rarity is adorable even when she's whiny
Consider the following: The original post that caused the thread to appear was by Twilight Mod. Twilight makes a single post in said thread before vanishing. Afterwords, it's nothing but anon posts. Posts that have quite the striking resemblances to the thread in question. At the very least, we can safely assume that the anon was at least a mod based on
based on the context of that one post. At the very least, this shows that SOMEPONY among the mods deserves a look at.
Agreed
Heluuuu again.
how in Celestia's name is this looping
I say she is even MORE adorable when she whines
cause this is EquestriaDaily, it always loops
to the post in question*
It`s an act of the gods
*leers eyes*
and we only post stuff that loops xD
hah true enough Ali
night all
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuFuAsXYtu0
Gah, lag.
No loop so HA
hmm I'm not feeling Rarityish tonight
<Aurora> ZREO? <-- Nup i Have that one, this one is different
night aero
6oh
11I use something called.... DeSmuME
What would your name be if you were ponified.
Night Boomer
BOOMER *fires M16*
rrrarhg
/me throws up
twinkie100
12night Slash
12ok
12its there

9thing is
12and Im in...
I'd probably figure one out as I go along.
9just use
12blah I'm having no patience tonight ._.
Oh Ivan... you don't use an M16, you use the dual pistols.
9Audacity or something as your sound input
9play a random sound
Man is it laggy today.
But those suck after getting, well, any weapon at all.
9and it will make the "Microphone" function for you
Besides Single Pistol
11I see that it has a microphone function, yeah.
Or magnum and melees depending on your taste
9also No$GBA + No$Zoomer is the best DS emulator
In what game again?
L4D2
Or one
Both actually
Oh, i see.
9Scale 2x + hq2xS filter = HNGHHHHHH
I like Meelee.
9dat quality
11I tried that as my first choice, but the download link it provided didn't work for some reason.
but DP has the speed of an assault rifle but with unlimited power
I prefer Brawl.
Honk.
Brawl is better
I still have my Melee
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTkyUNHBzMA OH GOD IT LOOPS
03:/
Melee is still pretty darned good.
03about that
03plz get on Xbox live
Banjo-Kazooie!
those vids dont appeal to me
11OH! I can download "OBJECTION" from youtube and use that as the Mic sound. XD
HUZZAH!
they flash to many images at once
its like brain over-load
OH DAMN. Droppin' Banjo Kazooie on us.
6ffffffff my usual group of people are gone
Banjo-Kazooie!
For some reason I feel as if a BK RPG would somehow work....
6I feel lacking lol
Wait what????
Rev
HOW
A what?
WHAT
WHEN
Like if it was like Mario RPG
Heluuuu
Ivan, most Rare Games are really RPGs in disguise.
UHHH
how?
lol
COMP SCHEDULE LOPPHOL"D?
Really now?
PONY cRAZE UP IN THIS cHATBOX
Collecting jiggies? Music notes? Eggs?
ARE YOU NOT BRACED ANYMORE?
Bring item X to character Y?
I've BEEN on here.
Um...
03this is why cliques suck
So it's more like the annoying sidequests
6...
And besides, it's 10:45.
6that's not what I meant lol
Texas?
I've got fifteen minutes.
I'm going now. I'll see you guys tomorrow. Same time, same place?
4Wait, how do you have what he said?
Banjo-Kazooie was an MMO and I didn't even know it
4If that's what he said
Aw hell yeah.
6but yeh, I'm usually skyping with them or my boyfriend, all of which are gone tonight it seems
BUT YOU...
I once dreamt about Banjo-Kazooie
nvm
Boyfriend :O
nvm'
But what?
I got confused
Nothing happened though
You're confusing.
oh hello bronies
4If that's what !!Twilight really said, I mean
you
It was just the game, but on a level that never existed
Heluuuu
re conshooting
im streaming every ep of yugioh abridged while i play WoW
http://tinyurl.com/3kem4t2
You and Hipster said it yourselves.
4You called them up verbatim
Oh Gawd. BKMMO.
I'd play that.
Losing Rare to Microsoft is one of the gaming industries worst moments EVER
9night Barry
Seriously.
9pretty much
^ true fax.
After that, we lost all hope for another amazing platformer EVER AGAIN
9that said, Silverscreen
WoW oh how dumbed down it is now
Notice that several of Rare's masterpieces were on N64.
Also, Whoopee Camp.
*that wasn't Nintendo
9that sorta defeats the purpose the of the "Objection" mic sound LOL
Earlier, in the chat.
I loved Tomba so much.
4Hipster said that Twilight called everyone children, that's most certainly not the case
4If that was in fact Twilight
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czNoQXwQ4kA OH LAWDY THIS ALSO LOOPS
I never got to play Tomba. D:
Tomba is awesome D:
Banjo-Tooie is what I consider to be the best game ever
of all time
I never got to beat it.
It's that guy that jumps on pigs a lot, right?
4All he said was that he felt all this arguing was going to fix nothing
Also when'd EB come bck o.o
back*
chacha doesn't know who my waifu is
A little bit ago, had to grab mah charger.
Conker would've one, but Banjo got to me first, and it has a wider audience
Yes.
*won
That would be the one.
Honestly, I never played Nuts & Bolts, but
4The only other anonymous posts
it seemed to force a gameplay mechanism into a series that didn't need it
It was the first video game I had the luxury of playing.
9I meant that for the
9obligatory parts
Was it better than that?
9with the fingerprint powder
What?
I heard that Nuts & Bolts was pretty bad
But I do want to know if those very few platforming segments worked
4Were the warning to Whelp, and a post that pretty much said that his view of the site and the people in it weren't going to change because the people on the site will always view him in the same light
4Nothing about children
4He didn't specifically berate the posters
4Except for Whelp
4And that was absolutely called for, IMO
Hey, if you guys miss rare, try the BK game on GBA
oh hey someone named EBB
It isn't half bad.
oh god I destroyed the fabric of this chatroom by posting kazooie's.
i hate myself
How?

11I haven't gotten that far yet.
haha
Now that I think about it I did name Minecraft to be the second best game ever so....
That gif is more erotic than it has any right to be
Maybe my opinion isn't accurate
Minecraft is pretty awesome.
It's not so much a game as it is a toy with a loss-condition
It needs wrenches.
Minecraft is Lego on steroids
what is minecraft? some game of some sort?
But... whatever it is, it's AMAZING.
kk
11I believe I"m at the part where I'm questioning the western ex-detective outside of the Evidence Room where the one murder took place.
So I can make TF2 jokes.
4Listen, I don't want to cause any trouble with any of you guys and I'm sorry if I upset you or Hipster
NEED A DISPENSER HERE
I think if there's ever a MLPFIM movie, that's when the cutie mark crusaders will finally get their cutie marks
I stand by my decision that Banjo-Tooie is the best game of all time
MLPFIM movie.
4I don't feel comfortable with this situation
DIRECTED BY MICHAEL BAY
I just think that if the mod was being a douche, they should be called out on it, that's all.
agreed Night
MLPFIM movie, would be epic
Nightboomfer, this is true fax.
but this was brought up the other day
and
Agreed
I second Night's idea.
Kinda the whole point of that thread.
its unlikely it would do well in theatres
TV Movie
Problem solved
9well
"THIS SUMMER.. ENTER A WORLD OF MAGIC UNLIKE ANYTHING YOU'VE EVER SEEN.
Or direct-to-DVD
4I feel the exact same way about Scootaloo
9good thing I got to tell you before then
took the words out of my keyboard Ivan
THIS SUMMER DISCOVER THE MAGIC
STARRING MORGAN FREEMAN AS SPIKE
Direct to DVD would be epic
THAT TOUCHED THE LIVES OF MILLIONS
eeyup
OF RANDOM INTERNET PEOPLE
nah D2DVD won't make as much of an impact
TARA STRONG AS TWILIGHT SPARKLE
THAT NO ONE CARES ABOUT
I can say, that I would go see it in a thaeatre
lol
same
AND MERYL STREEP AS CELSTIA
HAH
*DRAMATIC SOUND*
I haven't seen anything that chickenmod's done outside of moving into /rp/ so I can't say anything about that.
Whoa, capslock go!
That way they can have a series finale, without messing up the whole "The series can be watched in any order" thing
*MLP theme plays dramatically*
I want a movie based on voice actors who appear in EVERYTHING
I can so see Meryl Streep as Celestia
"...MY LITTLE PONY. RATED PG."
11Yep.
Morgan Freeman!
AWWW YEAAAAH
Nolan North and Tara Strong
Morgan Freeman as SPIKE.
Freemane*
4Then I really wish you had been here to see it
I want everyone to stand in the corner over there > http://kellywpa.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/banging-head-stick-man1.gif
John Wayne Gacy as Pinkie Pie
NO
Mareyl Streep?
I just hope they don't do anything dumb like put humans in there for no reason
YES
YES
I REFUSE TO STAND IN A CORNER
Good Celestia, SillyNilly. D:
That's just messed.
...you can't have a dead man in the studio!
How unsanitary~!
Undead, we use science to bring him to life!
Is it physically, magically, figuratively, or technically possible to make an official Human in Equestria story without it sucking?
...you'd bring Gacy back to life?
eeynope
*lightning bolt flashes in background, crack of thunder*
mmm... maybe... but it's an atomic chance
Whoops.
Meant to post that in Steam.
Lets see, play Arma 2 wiht a great community, or talk about ponies...
Ponies it is
Ponies.
lol
gz on spreading ponies thru steam
Get'cher priorities straight.
PONIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
High Hoof, Ivan!
ponies its not a question
achievement UNLOcKED
Arma 2 will be there when you're done.
(WHICH IS NEVARRRR)
lol
But PC Gamer's server wont be
That's the problem
Oh well
http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/20344 Ok this is amazing <3
Ach-Ach-Achievement UnLOcKED
I can always play the greatest FPS game of all time's sequel
Lies.
I have the strong opinion that if you're given a responsibility, you need to do the responsibility in a proffesional manner and leave your personal thoughs and opinions aside. The only exception to this is when said thoughts and opinions have a *positive* influence on said responsibility
Whenever it comes out
4Oh wait...there is a post that implies children
Oh wait.
I don't know if I'll go to bed yet.
LIES.
Don't be silly Ivan.
Maybe I'll start up my Desktop Ponies.
They'll never release
4The way how Hipster said it made it sound like he specifically said "everyone acts like children"
wb lightning
Team Fortress 3
4He didn't exactly say that though
/me hits rimshot
Lies, for Gabe Newell put EP3 under a salad plate.
Ha, you misspelled Battlefield
If everything can be improved by ponies, does that include movies that have starred Shaquille O'neill?
4He said "the majority of people here don't act like adults"
No.
you should get hypnotized if ur not tired enough. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTkyUNHBzMA
Some things... just can't be saved.
it repeats,
yeah. again, it was in response to Whelp, though, which might have influenced that comment.
TF2 is FAR better than BF2/3
Anything that starred Shaq can never be repaired
If everything can be improbed by ponies, does that include Rebecca Black's Friday?
Eh
Y'know what was a good game?
TF2 is mindlessly fun
improved*
I am Kazaam!
Mechwarrior 2.
It depends on what you want and who you play with
And frickin' Ghost Bear.
Shaq Fu?
But the manner it was stated in kinda ticked me off.
Ponies got Rebecca Black suspended.
That game was boss.
I prefer BF3 because of the immersive environment
12aaaand finished the survey
5People still here? D:
I don't care.
TF2 can't do immersive, only fun
6yes
/me 12lols
true enough
12in both of the boxes
And I have other games for that.
5Yay~ :3
12I wrote them novels XD
I dunno if I'd WANT TF2 with a story.
Although i really should play TF2 more
4I didn't catch it before because I hadn't quite come under the assumption that it was !!Twilight possibly posting as Anonymous
That was sort of the point of the recent "Producer" comic they did, wasn't it?
TF2 = meh, cSS = meh, GmoD = no wai, Minecraft = YES
TF2 has a FAR better developing team that CARE about their playes.
*players
4I actually did save it though...if only because I felt he was correct
Producer's trying to make their lives all dramatic...
True
XD
12"Why did you want OoT 3D?"
But it's not immersive
I'd play some more TF2 if I hadn't neglected logging on to Steam once in a while
What about Terraria, SD?
"I. Like. To Shoot. Gun. Is all you need to know."
12well...where do I begin?
lmao
12X3
And, EP3 will be immersive as all get out.
;3
Cute
Terria isn't FPS
I kinda like some of the fan theories surrounding TF2
Terraria is awsom too
SD, meh
12tho
Gtg.
12I didn't get explicit
Aw man, alright
well, im tempted to do a Zelda special next week o3o
See you guise tomorrow.
Ciao Revolver.
12the worst I said
bye
4No offense to anyone, but I seriously am telling you that we can't go one damn day without constant infighting and shit flinging at one another.
cya
Hello Everyone.
So who said something about Season 2 in 35 days?
Huzzah!
bye
SD stands for SomethingDifferent, SomethingDifferent.
12was that I saw adult Link on the N64 version and...
35 days
wat
...
I forgot
lolwut
5Oh gawd. xD;
12and then I said something like "anyway..."
From what I've seen, The intellectual discussion to mudfest ratio is 50/50 in my eyes.
It's Ivan; expect trolling.
Ah, I haven't been around these parts much
Someone said something about 2nd seasons being released two months later after season one on average
and everything in between is just random.
Also, I don't troll
12:3
I'm tired. It's monday. Expect short-tem memory loss.
At least I don't think I do....
:/
4Perhaps I'm just more pessimistic than you are
Well, it's been a pleasure but I'm gonna jet
...before I go, a little teasing:
Possible. I'm known to keep a positive view on things.
Take care.
byez
ok goo night
Those of you in the know or in the right places
good*
won't see the last of me yet. ;3
lol
I guarrentee LL would want me to do a special on LoZ XD
Kinda why I enjoy some of the "bad" movies we watch.
/me flees
dc test dc test
12:D
12<3 <3 <3
12Danny
03great
we heard you
XD
03she'll be listening to you, not me
03:|
12I'll go on XBL nao
12but
03k
12don't expect me to play
12I'll talk
They should make an episode called Super Ponybeat
03sure you will
XD
Focused on Vinyl of course
03I swear if I just hear LIIIIINK I'm leaivng
03*leaving
oh nice
XD
LIIIIIIIIIIIIINK
It also goes to show that when I find something that _really_ gets under my skin, it's usually something bad.
they should make an episode focused on DJ PON-3
/me RUNS
12D:
Take some inspiration from the fans and use them remixes they made
12LIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINK <3
But I've been known to be wrong as well.
12also
XD
12when I said why I got it
Derpy episode please
4Trust me, if he had said those things to me I would have been all for knocking his ass down a notch
12err
4But he didn't
12what led up to getting it
Make a completely fan chosen scenario episode,
epic
EPIC aight.
I'm the type of person who likes background characters too much
Derpy episode, isn't that confirmed?
4And I'm viewing this from a third party; neutral, so I have to be unbiased
Not sure, is it?
4I am friends with you guys
An episode where big Macintosh accidentally gets twilight Sparkle pregnant
Episodes focusing on background ponies can potentially destroy the personality assigned to her by the fandom
...
As in, if the show suddenly stopped being about the mane cast I wouldn't notice.
4But I have my own morals
Well, gonna go to bed nao; g'night.
Technically, I'm third party in this as well.
night
nite'
12I said "When I heard about it getting released on the 3DS, I bought the 3DS on release date(which happened to be my birthdate. Thank you Nintendo)
12"
gnite
Boomfer wtf
12oxo
Lyra and Bonbon need to remain in the background so I may continue assuming they're lesbians
thats what i tho
thought*
<---Paraspriting
I didn't even know of the thread until Hipster posted a link when I came into chat.
Trolololol
I prefer Lyra and BonBon as fwiends
Best Fwiends fowever
SWIENDS
o3o
12tho I DID tell them about how unhappy I was with the editing of the game
Fwiends with benefits
F*
Fwiends*
6686 has a point
12and I poked both the blocks and the Fire Temple theme
Bwenifwits*
11Well, I figured out how to work the mic on my Emulator. :D
Dcing sux
My wittle pwony Fwiendship is magi
4I guess so, but my empirical judgment is telling me that aside from his two actual mod posts he did nothing wrong because everything else is purely circumstantial and I shouldn't be biased towards it being !!Twilight who said it as anon.
4His anonymity, as I said earlier, saves him
thats not the way to spell it incorrectly
So if they did make a spinoff of the show, what would you want it to focus on.
hahaha
I never really mean half the stuff I spout. I wish there were an easier way to convey sarcasm through a text based medium
Assuming you wanted a spinoff at all
its myh lil pwny: frndshp iz magi
The cutie mark crusaders!
Probably why he switched to anon in the first place. Wanted to save face if somepony tried to use it against him.
^
My Little Bronies
Wow, I've been playing Phoenix Wright too much. x.x I'm starting to think like an attorney.
Although some hated the All Grown-up spinoff of Rugrats I liked it
Big Mackintosh in the Big City
Twilwight Spwawkle, Wainbow Dwash, Pwinkie Pwie, FwutterSwhy, AppleJwack
And I would love a similarly styled CMC Spinoff
ah that fails
luna... tons of luna
would they still be blank flanks in the future?

Nah
Twliht Sprkl, Rnbw Dsh, Pnki Pie, Fltrshy, Apljck
the heck? haha
4This entire discussion feels like a courtroom discussion
You know, I can't help but wonder
:3
Rrty
condensed
4Repetition >_<
cdnsd
I just noticed that too.
Since some kids shows DO have relationships
cndnsd spk fr th wn
rte m8
How long until they start doing relationships that "wing the other way"
relationships in mlp?
In kids shows
Not in MLP
that would be interesting
But it happens in other kids shows
4But yes, he could have done it to save face
Like spongebob and Fairly Odd Parents
4If it was !!Twilight mod, in fact
Not all the time, but it's happened before
hw cn u Spk n ths lang
lng*
not lang*
dammit
My Little Consonant: Disemvoweling is Magic
lol
It would probably have to start with implied relationships
Or should I say LL
Although that's arguably already happened
LL
Like Bon-Bon and Lyra
Rainbow Dash/ Soarin, just sayin...
As I said though (repetition inbound), it had to at least been a mod based on what they said. But outside of that, you're right, we can't tell.
Where 6686?
12wbs Chime
Bloomberg x Bucket of turnips?
I'd like to see Lyra X Bench
HAHA
...Ren and Stimpy?
LOLZ
I dunno
I doubt that
Although that isn't exactly the best example of a kids show
Awesome as it is, it was extreme for a kids show
Right, I'm tempted to make a half Special on RN next week, where most of the show, but not all of it is dedicated to OoT Music. Thoughts?
Spongebob and Patrick
Yeah I got nothin
Right....
But yeah, I think implied relationships would be the start
....wow. I managed to think of the weather without thinking of pegasi ponies for the first time in weeks. XD
12noooo
They've already gotten full-blown ones in movies and shows, although mostly stereotypical...
12:D
*Adult shows
!Isukra
/me has rain. :D
Not really adult, but not for kids
12even worse
11....
You know what I mean, Modern Family and stuff.
.............
Imma go to bed now.
/me RUNS
All of ya bronies are cRAZAH. I'm goin' to bed.
11Imma go to bed nao

12o-o
I hope more BF3 gameplay comes out soon.
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THAT GAME!
11g'night!
you knew it was coming ;p
Ok, well im the owner of my show, So i say That this half special is Happening
guys i'm tired

it's not like they were born with amazing art skills
we need more ponies

This is an amazing remastered version of this song
they practiced a lot (by drawing stuff)
with actual vocals in this
You're not born with art skills, but you are born with the passion to pursue them
Dari, are you there?
4Wait, you're probably asleep right now -_-
and that I do
4Oh well
True that, man.
Meh. It's still not a boolean though.
Very deep...
whats been frustrating is the transition of pencil to tablet
Nup
Dont have a script sadly
12o.o
I haaate the tablet, It makes me feel so beginner again, and I cant get good lines and whatnot, it just feels awkward
You'll get used to it, me thinks
Okay I just read this on a post: Femanons who grew up with the original show argued with bronies, bronies lost. Shit was so cash it was actual currency. They like made the bronies wonder why they called themselves fans when there was so much lore they knew nothing about.
I honestly don't have any idea what this guy is talking about.....
I know brony fan lore
hm...if i do play Fire Temple on RN this week, do I play V1.0 or V1.2?
should i play*

Hi

Hi
12aaaand King Dodongo gets all toasty~

It's on a website I like, so I would rather not get it raided...
Hallo
Ohai
XD
LL just beat what i just beat hours ago o3o
Aha!
/me hugs Captainpinkiepie
Sounds like the gist of the post is that there was certain lore established in G1-G3 and the new G4 fans don't know any of it
The first of my successful clones!
Yea okay rust
soon I will have an army!
is he gonna be golden brown?
XD
/me runs
/me isn't toasted
12yush :O

Of course... how relevant is said lore to G4, except as references and Mythology Gags?
/me sends in a spetznaz team to take care of the threat

I personally figured G4 was a brand new take on the pony universe

just no.
YES PONIES
Feathers are awesome
...Well, that's that. I think that's about the final cut...
Yes
Of course I'm not talking about full blown shipping
Feathers. FEATHERs.

Is it weird if I actually want an episode based on the halocaust

Did you ever imagine you'd be an expert on My Little Pony?
it's a conspiracy
XD
Nope
hha
Heh.
I remember my sister playing with them in the sanbox.
12he learns Din's Fire as a child ._.
Older, frightening ponies.
The earliest memory I have of them is tossing my sister's out the window of a car.
サンボクス
If you were born in the early 90s you tend to view the shows you DID see as SACRED, and the shows you didn't as wtf why did people like this...
She also had Lisa Frank off-brand ponies.
Hence why i don't really care for most shows pre-1996
hmmm
Which sucks, because everytime I talk about 90s cartoons, half of them I don't care about and half of them I LOVE
Man, so you're 16? I wish I was 16 again. Damn.
LOYALTY
I wish I was 12 again
FIRE
Like guts or all those other live action Nick shows in the 90s

what's going on
I came from the Lackadaisy fandom, where that sort of crap is commonplace
Lackadaisy Cats?
Lackadaisy
?
yeah exactly
Heh, I met Tracy.
She was our GoH a couple years back.
It's a webcomic that despite never getting updated, is still one of the greatest ever
btw super jealous
yo
She's pretty baller talented
Got her to do some art for me too.
She's fuggin' hilarious.
djamn brony, good play
reminds me of VG cats when it was still updating
Whom?
huh
Cut the bold out.
hey random
Vg cats no updates anymoar?
Barely
braely
yeah
Ya
once a month
scott is the laziest
Grooves, Lackadaisy is one of my favorite things.
But yeah you'd be surprised at how insanely active the lackadaisy RP board is compared to amount she updates
i wasted my entire evening looking through their comic archives
It's a really passionate fanbase
Me 2
but then i realized Scott does not update.
CUT THE BOLD OUT
BARELY updated
That seems like it.
erm,
no
bold is mine
Cut the bold out.
Erm, yes
so....
BOLD
I WILL MAKE A CUPCAKE OUTTA YA
Stop bolding.
...
oh you poor poor attentionfag
But yeah, I'm making some pony jazz music
That doen's affects anyone
tsk tsk :(
It's going to be adorable and amazing
lmfao i attacked a chicken and now im being mobbed
XD
Prestigi Comoski
i would like to see Octavia playing this
And I hope it inspires more bronies to write 1920s-era RPs
Jazz?
Curious.
Not bebop, but like dixie sort of stuff
Arturo Sandoval plays a mean trumpet
although pony bop would be applebuckin hilarious
I'll have to look into that
So......Season 2 out yet?
no
no
nope
35 moar days
October
stop remind us
isn't it?
lol thought i would ask neways
before i make you into a cupcake
December i though
Random. you were told to stop bolding.
I thought it was November.
what's with these typos
Hey
DerpyGrooves, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSzPbO9DFcg Like that kind of Jazz?
inb4 random gets KICKED
that doen't affects any rule

DerpyGrooves, old-school Jazz is something I'd appreciate.

awesome
I hear it a lot, considering I live near Acadiana.
thinking of macking a cosover fanfic with alice madness returns ranebow dh and make it a seqwal to rockit to insnity or fluttershy and mack it a whole new one
So to hear it ponified would be nice.
at least you didnt get mobbed into a game over XD
In closing, there needs to be more acoustic ponies, period
Ok, season 2 out is august?
I thought November ish.
I thought October
*wraaarwg*
I dig electro, but it all sort of blends into itself
12fail :P
12but I got blocked into a game over
Kungfusion!
12-.-
I think S2 comes out sometime in the last third of the year.
or luna
Right Now back into Jabu Jabu's belly for real, had to stock up on weapons
is S2 seriously supposed to come out in august?
12lolz
Luna MUST appear in s2
Whenever it is - it'll be around my birthday :3
o.e
/me 12ish taking a break to make Danny fell better about himself
She's already been confirmed to appear in S2
Luna apparently has been confirmed for a brief appearance.
lol
MUST
12oxo
Mmm no
I thought she was confirmed for an entire episode.
A whole chapter dedicated to her
YES
I haven't heard that.
*whoo*
o4o
Wait...
o3o*
Just that she had like, a 20 second part.
<.<
That would be stupid.
>episode 1 and 2 are crazy awesome with end of the world evil power fighting
i really want a luna episoe
The show creators have made chaos
>suddenly slice of life
Luna has one goddamn line in the whole series. These bronies are CRAZY
wtfamiwatching
2.
she had 2 lines
Episode 1 and 2's soundtrack remains unbeaten
soundtrack?
"I'm so sorry"
"I miss you so much big sister"
D:
i mean the background music
Oh
Lolwow
well
pilot is pilot
seriously I kinda was hoping for the rest of the season to be as awesome as the pilot
Now she has all this baggage of being some crazy abacus-loving antisocial wingy twilight sparkle clone
recently listen to ep1 and 2 background track only
wow
hah
Dat abacus
abacus
shaico, where is it?
what
PsychicKid: go read Progress (aka Luna Vs.)
nao
no, fanfics are horrible
CRAP, Im at the part where i need more weight to push a button down
I liked portal fanfic
12XD
but where do i find the extra weight o-o
I sort of wish the rest of the series had gone off the whole magic girl formula
RandomlyWier: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aj0lwIZTyso
BTW GASP!!!

OH
I'm liking the slice of life, honestly.

That silly fishy
12gawd

I like slice of life but I liked the pilot stuff too

NICE!
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-r7syHwOCDug/Tf5m6WvZReI/AAAAAAAAGLc/iW8Q6nsIzss/s1600/dancing+gala+grand.png
I heard season 2 is gonna have a recurring antagonist introduced, so maybe they're trying to push things back in the magic girl direction
magic girl?
lyra+bonbon is best ship
Shaico
hm?
It's the genre where it's a bunch of magic girls who fight a monster a week. Like Sailor moon
you saw how the ponies used magic to own the fuck out of nightmare right
lmfao
what derpy said
oh
mahou shoujo >_>;
lol awesome
Well
not all magical girl is like that though
That's what my mom calls it (She's japanese)
ojamajo doremi has like no fighting lol
magic filly u mean then
MAgical Poni
probably because mahou shoujo means magical girl
ding!
I got attacked by rainbows -.=.- wouldn't you hide your face in shame after that, never wanting to be seen again?
Magical girl?
You didn't get attacked...you got BEAT by rainbows.
You guys should go watch Puella Magi Madoka Magica :p
twice
Magical Girl, like Sailor Moon
Does anyone have a xbox?
plz
I do.
Does yours work yet? :P
me too
btw do you ever imagine an alternate universe where Pound Puppies or Strawberry shortcake had gotten popular instead of MLP?
yes
I shudder at the thought.
Secret Butt Fun
....
no
::S
It always creeps me out
Nightmare_Moon I heard that as Secret Butt Fund
i got it working
Shaico: would you like to make a contract? :3
Strawberry Shortcakes got the most fucked up eyes
huh what contract?
And the worst 'animation'
What if faust had done shortcake, tho?
Why did lauren faust quit?
and made it ironic and hilarious?
It reminds me of Big Forehead Russian Kids.
I never thought I'd see grown men buying girl toys, but anything can happen. o.o
>he thinks this is a new thing
Shaico: go watch Madoka
:p
laaaaaaaaaaagzilla
Oh yes.
i don't watch anime
Fooby what is your Gtag?
It's japanese powerpuff girls, and it's weird
lol
It's not just weird.
It is a parody of anime
japanese powerpuff girls is ppgz
It's /fantastical/
In anime format
Its a REMAKE
pinkypie would make a graet mad hatter
PPGZ IS HORRIBLE
DerpyGrooves: thats not really a mg show :p
Anything directed by Shinbou Akiyuki is good. ;x
and a bad one
SO
HORRIBLE
m a d o k a
Close enough, maybe?
then it got licensed
OhYeaPinkiePie: You don't remember from a couple nights ago? DL:
D:*
It was in spain for a while
sorry
The tachikomas are singing.
what is it?
;_; how do i get her in that room, its near impossible
rarety a grate duchus and twilight a grate catterpiller
BAi, G2g
Maria Holic was brilliant, the man can definitely direct.
Fooby Booby?
?
ClawfulFelidae
I'll hop on Red Dead later tonight, if you're awake ;P
:P*
there
Okay so a pony comes up to you
what do you do
Brohoof.
My brother's on Netflix right now, so I can't play yet :x
...and then poke it to find out what the hell it's made of.
Okay it turns out it's actually made out of whatever sort of plastic that the figures are made out of
So it's not super snuggleable
That is EXACTLY what I imagine it to be.
I would protect my ice cream sandwiches...
I had an incisdent with a horse and an ice cream sandwich.
then how would it be flexible?
The figures are bendy-ish
And they are probably warm.
So, more maleable.
Guys I stabbed myself with a compass. help
Got super glue, Retsamoreh?
Suckville. Where/how deep?
btw none of us are doctors
thats lame
except for doctor whooves
First aid kit. Get to it pronto.
Evening everypony.
No, seriously, super glue.
howdy splash
Super glue is made for this.
Hi PaintSplash
I just needed a bandaid.
Greetings Fireant
You act like I stabbed it all the way through my bone.
Well.
"stabbed" can be taken many ways.
*shrugs*
Bonżur.
No way I can interpret the nature of your condition
Like I "stabbed" my hand with a knife and it almost went all the way through. Sliced the tendon that controls my thumb.
You too?
Ouch.
Did that in 2006. Hurts every know and then.
ouchie!
No bloody way. Same year, even.
...but they fixed it with superglue.
A friend of mine slit thier hand open a while back coring apples....luckily no tendon damage
Ouchy
Got mine carving a pumpkin.
Tendon healed nicely.
DerpyGrooves, are you on here via the website?

Note the double monocles.
Tracy is an insane talent
yeah it took me a second to realize it wasn't glasses lol
Yeah she is. She's also just fun to hang around.
I had to watch the dealer's den for a while, and chatted with her.
She puts on this very professional exterior, but you don't have to dig far to understand how goofy she is, a lot like her comic.
Well you can just tell she's brilliant from her writing
Oh yes.
Like, that one poem she did for Dithyramb
I still have it memorized because it's really, really good
Remind me?
http://lackadaisy.foxprints.com/comic.php?comicid=14
Oh wow, that's from a while ago.
The only two webcomics I actually care something about are Lackadaisy and Skin Deep. Everything else is kinda on the wayside.
bahh, im gonna take a short break on the game
Oh hai
H-
I dig chainsawsuit
By..playing some OoT Music, maybe on a livestream >.>
or maybe not XD'
And nedroid is pretty funny
I also used to be into MSPaintAdventures but it just turned into such an insane clusterbuck I lost track
I thought I recognized the art style...
Oh THANK you.
Ooh
/me is multitabbing; reaction time is slow
My gf (the wolf in that pic I linked :P) tried to get me into MSPA, but once the trolls showed up I kinda just don't care.
I have been slacking on reading my webcomics :(
I've got a feed to Lackadaisy on my homepage. :P
Never missin' a beat.
I use Piperka to manage mine
Xiagu: Same here, for several of them, but I -do- have an excuse.
Oh really? An excuse? Let's hear it.
I have WAY too many webcomics that I like...
Say, one or two... hundred. ^^;
o____o
Whoa.
/me only reads 22
/me is a readaholic
I follow several comics. My interest kind of fades in stuff though when the artist goes into long space with no work.
fluttershy would look cute in an alice maddnes retuns dress dont you think
*nods* Same here, PaintSplash.
Fluttershy is cute in anything
Agreed.
12o.o
I dropped off reading VG cats a long time ago because he ceased updating for months at a time.
/me nods
o-o
Anyone read "Sequential Art"?
/me might hop on livestream again o3o
I do
I do whenever someone links me to it
I should get around to starting from the beginning ._.
it recently went into one of its plot tumor arcs again
well hi again
That is something with that comic...these arcs happen that don't really do anything overall.
Hey.
Still...I am a fan of his style.
...
/me tabs back in
Yeah, SA is one that I keep my eye on.
sorry, you guys make me go catch up on webcomics :P
[22:59:33] <PaintSplash> Anyone read "Sequential Art"?
welp
now I have to read 700~ pages
THANK YOU
:|
I'll just leave this here. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSlnZxvi37s
Flutterbro|Zzz: it's joke-a-day except when it's not!
I guess I'll have to start playing fighting games now.
BRB donut or cookie run.
btw if anypony around here ever has some free time, you should read qwantz
Wait.
Is this
funniest webcomic maybe ever
whiich one?
Gameplay video, oh god there's actually progress.
qwantz is too repetitive imo
THANK YOU PROMINENCE
that's the poin!t
OMG FIGHTING GAME OMG
qwantz = Dinosaur Comics
YEAH
*yeah
Makes me happy to be able to actually say 'We weren't joking.'
And back it up.
I make a webcomic...but I'm not really keen on sharing it with all these other great comic names...
I should browse ponychan more often x.x
Starting with your ponychan thread.
also, I have more than one artist name...so I don't like them linked...
Kinda fun having more than one pen name
none of the Hark! A Vagrant comics on ponychan are tagged well >:|
okay so I think we can all agree pinkiedash is canon
*cough*
oh, sorry
rainbowpie
( _ _)
....there's a difference?
Going to call it a night. Take care, all!
Does sound like an amazing desert.

Goodnight Blank!
Mmm Zingers.
aha excellent. http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/4447?search=kate_beaton
okay everypony. Unshorn fetlocks y.n
Hmm.
Depends.
PERSONALLY I don't see how plasticy ponies would have them.
yeah I don't really get that either
*I* keep mine in check. *huff*
its quite quiet.
It is.
I'm ok with this though.
Because it's really hard to type with boxing gloves on hooves.
i see what you did there
Heheh.

Haha
lol
That is great.
I used to love H*R
I still do.
Homestar hasn't done anything for like a year
But I still keep an eye on HRwiki
I haven't been there in ages.
I still wear my The Cheat hoodie in the cooler months.
It's a bit beat to hell, and people still ask why I have a Pikachu on my shirt, but eh.
My fantasy is that the bros chaps are in talks w. cartoon network to start a show
I hope.
With Regular show saying crap and adventure time, an internet cartoon getting a show
I'd say the environment is pretty rececptive
btw http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/26171
Oh god.
A comic about that thread Seth posted about last night?
People got crazy pissed about that thread
yeah lmao
Which thread? This shit's loading slow.
Crazy-pissed?
Oh god, what happened when I stopped reading?
Hahaha
wait...what happened?
it's a split between "love and tolerance" vs "kill the crazy bitch"
btw it turns out she didn't actually throw it away
wwaaat
...
Oh dear.
She gave it to the little girl she takes care of in her spare time
Not sure if that makes up for it.
I can't believe people were suggesting "kill her"
Eugh...
Well, that's the internet.
Yeah it's sort of the same thing, but at least the girl is having fun
yeah lol little bit of an overreaction
wait what happened?
where'd you get that info?
Someone on ponychan posted about how his mom threw out his Rarity Brushable.
People started talking about it all.
oh god
It was pretty silly.
What did he/she do to get it taken away?
Nothing, aside from buying it.
nothing
it's the EqD topic change, you surprized?
"Oh, I threw it away. It's garbage."
I have a query. How many pony minecraft servers are there now?
Thousands upon thousands.
s/many/many known/
Nice to assume something is just garbage...
The lost Rarity.
For shame.
I can't understand why you'd do that to your kid.
Parents do silly things.
I forgot how much work is involved to eat a Jolly Rancher.
OhYeaPinkiePie is gone, dern

thankies
gah, my mirc acted up weirdly
but i fixed it
So many people, not sayong anything.

Meh, I'm done with OoT for tonight x.x

These ponies don't deserve it, they will all be banished to the Sun for 1000 years.
Oh okay.

Not enough bronies on Omegle

hello?
Hello
Rawr Flutterbro
Apperantly someone has my username here
also btw
im new
what
the
are you kidding?
me too
i thought i only had FlutterBro
there
So why are you guys fans of FiM?
anyways i'm new
Hard to say Mara.
watch the episodes, enjoy ponies
SS
Like ponies. Fun show.
Good fanbase.
I beat Dodongos Cavern
ah okies
and nao Im after Bottles and Hearts and upgrades etc
k
I'm pretty sure "reasons to like FiM" have been compiled elsewhere on the internet, by peoplewho have a better understanding than I about what makes a show good.
hmm...i change my mind, im gonna try to beat this belly level
.v.
lol
*opens guide* >.>
fail
x.x
I know.
im stuck at a part
But the basic rundown: Good animation, likable and well-rounded characters, not dripping with overt stupidity like most other television these days,
XD
"Why can't I stop watching this"-ness
this princess in this level is a pain .-.
oh dont worry
Characters with character.
I mean I guess its okay for a kids show and all, and I like some of the characters but I feel like the setting's kinda bland atm.
shes gone the second half :3
yay
it's only been one season. they need more time to develop it i think.
then link wont end up hitting on her .-.
/me RUNS
Agreeing with Balloons there.
xx
But it's had about as good a start as one could hope for.
Ok, im in a room with what looks like a long thingy that hangs down
what do i do XD
I think most of the reason to stick with the show comes from the fanbase.
any admins here?
Nope.
lol
boomerang
Sorry.
Oh sure. This fanbase will never die.
can you tell me about this chat server?
etc
im trying that
Flutter_Bro: irc.lightirc.com
i never used a IRC
Ehh... the fanbase might die, but at least in it's lifespan it's produced some brilliant fics and artworks.
True, its only been a season, but I feel like the eps are kinda predictable. I mean, don't get me wrong I'm not saying I hate it, but at the same time I'm not sure you could consider me a fan either
target it
Maren: you care enough to come here and chat at least :p
Thanks!
that helped xD
XD
Hoo boy. I doubt it. If you compare it to anything else that's had as much hype as this, there will always be those hardcore fans keeping the fandom well and alive
That's fair Maren. And you're right about the show being predictable.
is Username ownership permnament?
yay i beat that long thingy
Pernament
/me goes after the last Bomb upgrade
There's just something likable about the whole thing. Can't quite define it.
Flutter_Bro: yes
unless they inactivity timeout
Parasitic Tentacle?
oh
oh
yeah XD
i have a horrible way of describing things XD
I've only seen about five episodes and found it to be predictable, too. I'm having a hard time getting myself to wathc more because of that
so it's not permanent
btw
just until they leave
Yes.
3 more of those ;3
Yes it's predictable, but so is a lot of TV shows and films
You still watch them though
oh lord
or is it 2?
party of one ftw
You can register a nick to an email.
I'm just trying to understand the fanbase better atm
2 or 3
how
Speak for yourself. I can't stand watching any predictable shows
What's there to understand? We are fans of the show and we group together at these fansites
Well...you tried the show, so fair enough...
To each his own.
@Outline well said.
And yeah, some shows are predictable, but I guess what I'm trying to say is that most of the time I can tell how the story's going to unravel in 2-5 minutes.
how do i link my mail to a username?
oh
I GOT THE COMPASS :D
Maren personally I enjoy the characters and setting over plot
Definitely the characters
lolk
Well maren, it IS a kids show. You have to expect that it's going to be reasonably predictable.
I totally understand why you guys like it so much. The animation is superb and the characters certainly do stand out
RAINBOW DASH IS AWESOME!!!!!!
Yes.
That was a Pinkie Pie level of explosiveness
/me hates around the room
I would recommend reading some of the higher-rated fics if the show itself doesn't appeal.
Your hatred is pure, Pure_Hatred
/)^3^(\ Dash is SO AWESOME
/me turns everyone into cars for no reason
Oh my *adds smilie to his collection*
/me avoids
/me also avoids
Ok, ive taken all the tentacles out, now what

03Now Sega Gets Hacked Too - 1.29 Million Customer Details Leaked
03Sega is the latest company to face the wrath of hackers, as 1.29 million customer details were leaked.
03While no credit card information was stolen this time, unlike the 100 million user data leak experienced by Sony, many other user details were stolen, including full names, birthdays, email addresses and passwords. The taken passwords were encrypted, however.
03The data were stored on the Sega Pass website, a service Sega set up to provide new product information for registered customers.
03Sega has already launched a full investigation of the matter, and will provide more details regarding the hack when details emerge.
03No group has yet taken responsibility for the incident, but hacking group LulzSec, in the news recently for hacking a series of high profile targets including Sony Pictures, PBS and even the official website of the US Senate, seems to have denied being responsible for this latest attack, and have even offered help to Sega to track down those responsible. "We want to help you destroy the hackers that attacked you. We
welp, I'm gonna trott off...night.
attacked you. We <-- cuts off
03"We want to help you destroy the hackers that attacked you. We love the Dreamcast, these people are going down," tweeted LulzSec.
03you also could hdave clicked on the link
I'm too lazy and not all that interested

but hey, drf
just use
03well
03if there's one thing I hate more than MLP
03it's misrepresentation of information
03and when people keep bashing on a station for being "FOX News"
03when it's nothing of the sort
03that gets on my nerves./
You hate MLP:FiM
But do you need to say
EW MLP
in like size 30 font?
... >>;
@ drf
Then I should also be able to say
so basically it ignores anything with ponies, mLP and pony in it and writes it to ponycrap.txt ;p
EW ANDROIDS AND MICROSOFT AND APPLE BASHERS AND 5TH GEN POKEMON HATERS
03if someone made a thread about that
03then sure
in 30-point font on the forums as well
Ew 5th gen >:
03but if you just did that randomly that would be thread hijacking
03and I'm not a Microsoft fan o.o
03I have an Xbox 360, but I also have a Wii
03and I admit they're evil
03they're just better than APple
03o.op
03-p
Apple is not as evil as you think
03yes they are
Microsoft has it's fair share of evil
LL YAY I FOUND IT :D
They are just as bad as Apple
lol why are you using "evil"?
Corporations.
:3
that's not really a good way to describe it
Are by default, evil
03MLP is made by a corporation
03I think that about sums it up

FD
Yes.
*pay to play
*X
Not pay to play.
It is free.
hmm
The novelty of having an avatar of anything you want roaming around a user-created world actually gets kinda old.
ok, if you can be a pony for free and you want to be a pony for free i guess it's ok... my real question is if you have something to do once you are a pony...
yay i got there
03off to bed
Nope.
Yay the hater is gone
nini Danny
/me hides
03I saw that
03and you're no better since you're hating me
You could participate in some form of commerce.
i mean, just going around on 4 hooves could grow kinda boring after some minutes....
You are the one who started the whole mess
If you want people to stop hating on you
Kinda.
Then stop hating on other people
same goes for drf, although he doesn't exactly hate on other people
Take that and rub it in his face first
;p
03How do you know I started it? Were you there when I first joined TST? I don't think so, I've been here a lot longer than you so shut up
no events, no GMs that make things happen?
I joined SL in 2005 and still pop on from time to time.
No.
If Arti sees this, what will she think?
03and no, I don't hate people, only things
03until an iPod can get up and tell me I hurt its feelings
Imagine this chat in 3D with the ability to build buildings and change your avatar into anything.
03I honestly don't care
mh, dunno, not my genre... i'm more story oriented when i RP
And if you purchase in-game currency, you can buy things.
Threatening isn't going to help your case :|
Oh, you could set up a story RP.
12drf you would love this coffee place across the street from the hobby shop
Gotta get participants.
And you gotta keep out griefers.
I can't stand both Apple bashers and fanboys
12i couldn't go on their network with my ipod or my linux computer
12only windows
as usual
03LOL
12i finally said "you know what... no shirt, no shoes, no microsoft, no service"
I hate new Pokémon gen bashers
Keeping out griefers is half the fun of SL.
03well I hate basher bashers
LL i found the faries, was i supposed to grab all of them?
/me faceclaws
12you know what
pegasi fly?
12if you both kept your opinions to yourself
in SL
no, just 3
Everyone flies.
Oh
03that was actually accidental
12if you both kept your opinions to yourself, this wouldn't happen
*facepalms*
if you don't want to, too bad
Flying is just a way to get around in SL.
the rest can heal u
O-o
just put up with it
Everyone can do it.
ok
You know
Someponies bounce.
arguing isn't going to help anything, lol
You are an ADULT
You can get vehicles to fly around in.
they respawn
an ADULT that HATES A CHILDREN'S GAME
Can mock up battles in X-Wings.
03so in this case, YOU are starting it
03I don't hate the games
03I play White daily
03I hate the creatures
And A CHILDREN'S CARTOON that is enjoyed by ADULTS
Some even have scripted damage and blow up.
03adults who try to steal money from the government so they can sit at home being stupid
k
mh.... ok, i think i got the genre of gaming
thanks
not sure if wants, i'll see
cya
Heh, there really isn't a "genre" to SL.
Adios.
LL i only grabbed 3, would they pop up in my inventory or is it automatic for healing?
are they in bottles?
.-.
CRAP
if not, theyre gone
bloody hell.
leave the pool then return
MMO?
they respawn
i dont have a bottle tho
thats why i said bloody hell.
catch one in...
a milk bottle?
you HAVE to
yes
MMO kinda implies an objective.
drink the milk
then use the bottle to catch a fairy
i got a fairy
03that was just throwing fuel on the fire, and I will not fight unless I'm defending myself in which case I"ll fight back.
same goes with however many bottles you have
I think he's trying to put you on ignore :x
k
Danny
12drf
12i would probably say the same thing
go to bed
12but you know i only say it to be funny right?
plz x.x
MMORPG would.
03but if I leave, that lets him win :|}
03-}
no
But MMO just means that it's a game where a lot of people are on it
sometimes you have to lose
I guess.
it's essentially 'stupid internet bullshit' now with visuals
12i never mean any offense to anyone
/me just puts a Snivy and Nightmare Moon plush in his place and scampers away
thats you needing to go
with all the good and bad that comes with it
12although i probably get close to that border everyday x-x
BOTH of you are being immature
I wanna kill altair
03LOL
03anyway
typical boys, so I cant say Im suprised :/
I know
03but seriously, I only ever bash products, not people, I really don't *hate* anyone - but if someone just starts saying crap about me you can't expect me to sit there and watch calmly
I only have 2 bottles, i think that will hopefully do for now
12well they aren't the only boys in the universe
kay
yes
12ZXDDD
I know
SS
122 baby bottles for both of them
drf, it's pride
everyone has it ;p
.-. No Umbreon
I know I do
12XDDD
12i fail so much XDD
they will revive you when you die
not really
im just apparently talking within an arguement
so keep them in your inventory
thanks LL
03anyway
i will
03oww, my head hurts, because I'm sunburned
12i never even noticed the argument start
good luck
03so with that good night everyone >_> and if more crap goes on behind my back let me know please
12for some reason my head is itching
/me sees all anyway
12like crazy
Danny

12it's a show i like to watch if it's on
12i can't picture myself saying "okay let's watch the i love lucy dvd box set"
Except without the space in front
And without the <> marks,
/me obtains OoTs namesake
12LoZ
and in place of the words inside the <> marks, your password and email, obviously
no
i'm downloading it so that way i can chat on here and browse on Equestria Daily, and without having to refresh every few hours, cause my chat on here is messed up..

Without the space in front :l

Bottom of the Well and Ice cavern
Like 3-4 max
:3
I am ashamed to say that I have one password set on 90% of sites and comps xd
I just use easily-connectable words.

nini
For example, one password is related to the other by way of synonyms.
Ditto. I only have one password, with variable numbers at the end :(
;o nini
Thank god I vary usernames.

03and see, this is a much better discussion as I can actually take part :D
/me hides
12...
8thats the one i get all the time
03let me rephrase
12yes
12an arguement
03it's; not so much the Zelda stuff that annoys me
12how fitting
03it's when I can't say anything
Family guy yeah...
03because it's nothing I know
PONIES ARE BILINGUAL BY NATURE
used to be great
03then I'm sitting there watching entire lines of scrollback
12then
brb
12play it
AND THEY SPEAK ENGLISH.
03how about no
12and you'll know
Also, they somehow no what the F*CK french means....
03because you';re clearly too busy helping everyone ELSE with the game
03to help me
03if I need it
03more like
03when I need it
03sop
03-p
03some other time
12not really
I don't play any of these Zelda games that were being talked about.
Hence, they know about france...
Did you see me whining? No.
Hence...Equestria exists
13THEN I say my opinion
13:3
im only asking for help cause im new with teh game ;p
o3o
03I wasn't whining
12Danny
03I just said "someone tell me when this discussion is over"
Ponylogic
12ANYONE who needs help in OoT
kback
can't deny it
12I answer to
Flawless logic
03OK
12even Kipi when he was here >.>
03so THAT'S how to get your attention
/me hides
12well
...I'm starting to suspect....
that ponies.....
12that was Majora's Mask
12but w/e
....will take over the world after we all die....
03oh god
Hipster, just got the email update and shtuffs. So if I have you understood you want someone to be able to stream the new episodes when they air, straight from the hub onto our interwebs?
I wish.
6Majora's Mask is so stressful lol
Why
That would be awesome.
13But either way, I just simply idle and do other stuff and not pay any attention to a conversation I can't relate to
/me prepares to use gline
Will they destroy the Statue of Liberty?
Wait...you wish we were dead?
We would all be dead though
13the topic will always change eventually
13:B
So I heard you're talking about france ?
How is that a good thing!?
6...>.>
03what
That's okay with me.
Yes they probably would Gravekeeper
7Ah, meep, AE.
8yes
03I think pretty much everyone here is pissed at disney
We're due anyways, right?
03and I mean the user, not the company a:P
03-a
7Similar when the talk ends up about computer tech. o.O
Those darn, dirty equines!
6and you're horrible
12way to be nasty about it
And a legacy would be all the more awesome.
03for banning someone that's breaking rules?
12right when they join
8we have a few people lined up, but we still want more alternates in case anything goes wrong
03Yeah, OK, that's totally not doing my job
So they should know what humans are by examining fossils and ruins...
03I know
ah sounds genius. Means I won't have to wait for the youtube uploads to see the episodes as they first air
6also, second to what quan said
03I was going to gline them yesterday
Hence they know what france is
03but they left
03so I was like
03whatever
And why they have such a sporadic era of technology
6ok granted, I wasn't here
drf, lighten up
Planet of the Apes. Except with ponies.
I'm assuming MLP won't air in the UK at the same time, or even nearly so
That'd be pretty cool, gotta say.
03we have a rule
03you have to be 13
/me kicks you all.
6bt i never can tell with you, you're not exactly the kindest person to people lol
03she's like 11 or something
03so
6oh
6well
depends how much of a UK fanbase it gets over the summer I presume
6then go ahead lol
Ranging from DJ Turntables, to quils as pens.
03yeah that's already #1 broken
Aww.
12ok
03#2 is she refuses to use proper English
Yeah when Fluttershy was telling Rarity in Dress for Sucess
03when we tell her to every time
12that I'll accept
Improper english too :<
03she says antyhing
03*anything
03exactly
French Haute Coutre sucks, though.
And that would also explain why 90% of their stuff is made for humans
03and people just call me mean without even knowing the whole story
*reads the buffer*
12well Danny
They replicated our technology
03Arti told me she was already going to ban
12you're saying things
03but that Nick said not to
03unlike her, I don't answer to him
12and not everyone was here
I wonder how ponies were made sentiant AFTER we die, then?
12that looked like open hostility
hmmm
12to me
7Aggressive versus passive expression?
But then what about the whole sun and the moon being raised buy Alicorns thing?
Escaped Genetics experiments.
Magic.
haha everyooe:D
It's magic
Ain't gotta explain...
Nuff said.
Okay
*caugh*jealousofmagicnow*cough*
6well in my opinion, if the age rule is broken, there's no way around it lol
8if its at the same time, it'll be at what, 1:30 here?
6just use the ban and done
03yeah
So it's official, the human race is going to be dominated by ponies
6dunno why arti said not to
Or will have died out when they become sentient
8which i think would put it around 6:30 GMT
It has been offical
Or we live on, but are on another planet.
03I mean, if someone's younger and actually acts mature, then I probably won't notice and won't care
SPACE WARS W/PONIES
03but in this case it's blatantly obvious
And Ponies, given time, SHOULD be able to create time machines, working off our technology, right>
?
Yes.
THIS EXPLAINS SO MUCH
PONIES FROM THE FUTURE.
:/
/me slow claps
Pinkie Gigas?
They made themselves sentient.
well, That was just low drf
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2GThfvYp7U&feature=related
03how is banning someone for breaking the rules low
6that wasn't really low
w/e
03I seriously do not see why you keep sticking up for rule breakers
7This would be an inappropriate time to add a reference.
12Danny was in the right, SS
03this is like the third time now
6it's one thing if it's just how a person acts, but age rule is strict
pretty sure I'll be at uni around that time
More like X-Com
ok ok ;P
w/e drf
6it's actually illegal for people under 13 to be on forums and stuff
03and if they act annoying AND are too young, it's a double whammy :P
Currently they have MLP: FiM running three times a day Tuesday-Friday
6or whatever that was
03well
...
6whoever said that
hahahaha
But with ponies
Illegal O.o
:P
03they're supposed to get their parent's permission
03but does that ever happen?
MOVING ON
10Most sites expect you to be at least 13 years old @ SS
twice a day Saturday-Monday
*pray that I can convert my Uni flatmates to convert, so we can all enjoy ponies togethaarr*
And we will probably lose because the bronies will defect
I know that :P
Ponies made themselves sentient by time portaling back to our time and working with top scientists.
It's happening at an alarming pace already
03that was one reason I found #SW annoying for a while, since we had all these young people
I feel as if I'm the only brony loyal to humans.
Twice a day Saturday and Monday*
03but thankfully we don't have to worry about that anymore LOL
You are.
watch that and tell me a name that involves Pinkie and Gygas
but yeah, even at Uni I'll still be around (providing the community stays as active as it is now), just a different location innit

03OoT is not important
that's interesting Barry. I wonder if they'll keep the same 'multi-showing' or just air each episode one by one for first showing
it is to me
6to get a referral from a doctor for a doctor because the old referral doesn't work for a certain doctor so now i need a new one X.x
12and a literal minute left
:p
I was referancing Castlevania, though.
D:
O.o
you said it not me
12I got the eyedrops to Biggoron
03LOL what do you need a referral from a doctor for?
What is this place?
Stereotypes who hate ponies
I mean seeing how damn popular a kids show has become, it might tear up the rulebook a bit :P
CASTLEVANIA.
I wanna play the new Castlevania games
/me goes back to listening to Puella Magi OST
I believe it's called "Foods Libraries"...
Terraria and metroid are awesome
6to go to a speech therapist for a throat study
12prolly for imunization recordds
yes
12-d
6also +1 for skylands
Tuesday-Friday, they show an episode at 8:30 AM, an encore of that episode at 1:30 PM, and a different episode at 6:30 PM
Foods...libraries
So by logic so should Castlevania
12oh
6that soundtrack <3
Wow o.o
10Yes :3
Lol puella

sup Mongoose
6I've watched the series 4 times by now
6...
oh hey mongoose
6that's Octavia's theme o.o
13MakeAContractWithMe LOL
Not sure how the episode line-up will be on CN come July
Sup Goosemon
10Dunno
Gooseman.
best way to kill a pony ?
Imagine us now on ponies conqouring the non-bronies
6well, some people consider it Kyoko's I guess, since that was the big fight
Goosemon the best type of digimon there is.
But whai?
tell him that some humans are cloping to them
D:
6but it's technically octavia's
Why would you do that?
10Then YT must not have hers
My god, The Dark Crystal is a terrible movie
I have a 30-second lag connection to the chat.
This is not good.
10Oh well, still good
hahaha
6if she has a specific theme, it should be on the OST
No, I will side with the bronies in the Brony-Non-brony wars
The dark crystal...
10medievalish
But not the pony-human wars
Tomorrow's 8:30 AM episode will be Sonic Rainboom
Ponies are better than mankind.
/me 12reminded of a final boss theme
True fax.
the ponies would take you prisoner because you are a human
6mami's theme still is awesome
I don't care, I like being human
12sounds as epic
10Yep
Ponies were conceived by human minds.
Okay.
Good.
Let them.
6I have the nico cover version as my alarm on my phone
6so nice to wake up to
6*.*
Humans are mean.
and then execute you because they are ethnic cleansers
6...*_*
Would it not follow that in the soul of humanity there lurks all the elements of pony/
12XD
6whatever
So mea n.
I'm one of few, if any, bronies that woud fight for the humans if a pony-human war happened.

12that
also, there is no way to have humans in the same style of MLP:FIM without them being COMPLETELY, OUTRAGEOUSLY creepy...
And watch ponies.
and talk about ponies
How could I fight?
12is making me think of another song
hitler is more awesome than you, because he has a moustache, no one would want to be executed by him... or anything to do with him... except for that moustache...
6that's like one of my favorite songs ever
Not fun fighting something THAT amazing.
6that and MAGIA, the anime's ending
Fassad, being excecuted by Hitler himself would be weird.
...Hitler is one of the meanest humans of all human history. Mean.
10Ending > opening
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGvlSj_apw4&feature=feedlik
he is mean
I'm pretty sure people wouldn't mind being executed by Hitler's moustache
6^
So is Stalin
Being excecuted by Hitler MOUSTACHE, however, would be cool.
6I've grown to like the OP, but yeah MAGIA is SOOOOO much better
Exactly
But I still like to live
12http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_5nFS5xxJU the previous song reminds me of this o.o
Stalin was just always angry, all the time.

i wouldn't, on the other hand, his moustache is too awesome
6and I keep switching between the ending version, and the 1st episode version
6both are intense
So yeah, GO HUMANS
WE HAVE THUMBS
THUMBS?
THUMBS
THUMBS ARE TRIVIAL.
at least allow me to grow a moustache and then shave it into a square because it's an awesom moustache.
BUT AWSEOME
They matter not.
I hate thumbs
Quit the crap guys
THUMBS ARE SO AWESOME
okay
SAYAKAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
When you are a pony, REALITY BENDS TO YOUR WILL.
SO YOU DON'T NEED THUMBS.
That only applies to pinkie
You will be, but a lowly earth pony
Of course Magia is better
10Sayaka and Madoka are my least favourite
No, Octavia too.
It's Kajiura
How does she play that bass?
6sayaka is my least favorite too
6granted, I love all the characters ina way
very carefully
Celestia would never give us humans powers.
She is too big a tyrant
6but Mami and Kyoko >>>>> everyone
And you know that means? me-Right Pinkie but where do we find 10K gallons of chocolate pudding and a live chicken on Sunday?

Why is Celestia a Princess?
What happened to her parents?
6this song can loop as many times as possible, I love it
because queens are jerks
12makes me think of that
because she's fair, that's why
^
6I just can't believe how long it took me to track down the 1st episode version
Because she is afraid to Queen it up
King Arthur?
or maybe the Queen is a nice Queen who was locked in a dungeon by her tyranical daughter, the princess?
Revo is trying to troll?
We should ask Lauren Faust
How is Revolver troling?
I have no idea what the f-ck is goin on...

I would say "Jesus" to that "which human is the best human" thing...but that would cause GREAT controversy, so ignore this comment
12blah
12no
Laures IS the best human.
The world is going to end.
I've always liked the theory that Celestia threw her parents in a dungeon and ruled Equestria with an iron hoof
12not @the above
o.o
12@OoT 3D
Jesus doesn't count as a human.

HAHHAAHAHAHAHAHHA
OH GOD

Jesus and Lucifer were like brothers
oh shi-RELIGIOUS DEBATE, TAKE COVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You're kidding?
12there's a slight difference in the N64 game's Forest Temple theme and the soundtrack
:l
12's
Lucifer was an angel.
A third of the pony host banished to the moon
Nightmare Moon would be more like that
/me dives behind cover
EVERY
TIME
6I love the forest temple theme
IT MAKES ME LAUGH
12the soundtrack's added part sounds HORRIBLE
8''''D
12Roara
okay
12I showed you the difference, correct?
one more time and then I move on
Nightmare moon is to Luna as Satan is to Lucifer?
I guess?
idk
6the doo doo doo doo part?
Not really
/me 12nods
6....how ever i should type that
I think so.
6yeh
If Twilight turned evil, that would fit Lucifer better
12they used the soundtrack's one >_>;
12and it sounds horrid
Lucifer wasn't evil.
:o
Although yeah, Nightmare moon would fit
13I always find it hilarious when people try to hum parts of a tune in the form of text LOL
Well, at his genesis so to speak.
Although she is a little too powerful for that.
Because Lucifer was an angel like Luna, an then became evil.(Nighmare Moon)
XD
Not true too.
Same AE
I can't argue religion with you guise.
12it should be a slower doo doo doo doo doo
12but nooooooo they used the fast 2-doo
Why are we arguing about religion?
Lucifer isn't the leader of hell or anything though.
/me 12-.-
Lucifer's plan was to force ponies—er, people to love God by force, if I recall correctly
Lucifer - a name for Jesus, really. The one who bring light.
Nightmare Moon was the same

Hey, Fassad is a McDuck?
and now we're talking about religion?
6LL, do you know if someone has a clip of the original Forest Temple song on YT?

6the ONLY good songs that came out of it were Clock Town, Clock Town's Final Hours, Stone Temple, and Song of Healing
12good one XD
Anyways, I like RTS games
It would have something to do with the freindship flowing.
aaaaaaaaaanyways
They're just all the same.
6lol @that
Revo sucks at telling people that they suck at trolling.
12Stone Temple <3
12err
6...
6tower
12*Stone Tower Temple <3
6wtf lol
I can accept this.
you suck at saying the Rev sucks at telling people that they suck at trolling
So my sister tells me Rebecca Black is in the music video for a Katy Perry song (eugh).
THE FRIENDSHIP MUST FLOW.
Starcraft, Command and Conquer, Red Alert, and most RTS games are too similar
Dune 2000 was cool.
One is just more balanced than the other.
6that sounded like a "so a guy walks into a bar" joke
6I was waiting for a punch line
12lolz
And Ivan, those are the crappy ones.
Maybe a Pony RTS would be more like a giant football game
13LOL
I like it when strategy games mix it up
Try Dawn of War.
Each player strives to gather the Elements of Harmony
12and Roara
Cog sucks at remining me that I suck when saying that people suck at saying that other people suck at trolling.
Or World in Conflict
12I kinda like Termina's theme o.o
Applejack is the best pony, don't discuss
12tho
Rafasde should not be telling a mod that they suck at anything...
Applejack is the NICEST, not the best.
Applejack and Rainbow Dash are the best.
X-Com was really unique
12I HATE how it starts off like Hyrule Field's
6I'm REALLY unimpressed with the songs you have to learn in that game
Silly CogWeaver, that's not how you spell APPLEBLOOM
Rainbow Dash, yes.
X-Com was AWESOME.
lol, B-Man
6they're not nearly as interesting as OoT
Apple Bloom?
/me 12nods
B-Man you're getting the CMC names mixed up
Really?
It's Scootaloo remember?
My favorite CMC is Scootaloo.
6oath to order is ok
^
Apple Bloom here.
12yah
Favorite pony it's Rainbow Dash. PEGASI.
My Favorite CMC, and favorite pony is Scootaloo
*is
12but >_> Goron's Lullaby
6song of healing goes without saying
6...god lol
Applebloom is DEFINATELY the cutest pony...but not the best
But I think the best pony is Fluttershy
12and that brat you learn it from
Applejack is the best pony
Although Scootaloo is really coming close.
Applebloom is teh awesome.
Either way all the coolest ponies Pegasi
We can agree to taht right?
12so boring it put him to sleep just singing it
6STFU
6seriously
Apple Bloom is fun to draw when you add Grimdark.
/me 12hides
12XD
I like Scoot's and Dash's awsome pegasi stuff.
Ivan: nope.avi
6he doesn't STOP
12and when you win/lose the Goron Races(which I admit is fun)
ಠ_ಠ
Cog: srsly?.avi
Apple Bloom is most definately cutest.
12HE gives the speeches
Pegasi = coolest
Apple Bloom is the cutest. Agreed.
Scootaloo is best CMC
^
Fluttershy is the best pony
/me 12takes the Gold Dust Bottle and shoves it over his head
AB is still cute tho
And RD is the awesomest Character
and no one remembers Sweetie Belle :(
yep
Who?
So... Sweetie Belle is the worst CMC. Agree?
no one remembers....whats her name again?
no
NOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!
not the worst, but most neglected
Sweetie Belle is annoying in Desktop Ponies.
"No"?
I think she's the sister of that one pony no one likes
Who is, AppleDash?
Applebloom > Sweetie Belle > Scootaloo
But I still have her on there....
COG YOU ARE GOING TO DIE
Damn, Ivan stop rading my mind man.
6the song of time reversion and compression
I LOVE DESKTOP PONIES
12the New Wave Bossa Nova was pointless
Sweetie doesn't have as much as Scoots and Apple Bloom, so that may be why
I have Twilight, RD, AJ, and the CMC on my desktop.
6whaaaaat >.>
COG YOU ARE GOING TO... wait, Ivan said this already.
Although the new sounds are annoying.
6and yeh, that one was horrible
The CMC are worthy.
6I seriously hated NWBN
Fluttershy is not, apparently.
12woot, I summoned a TURTLE :D
Or Pinkie.
I have EVERYONE on my desktop, minus duplicates
Or Rarity.
12...now what?
Silly chatters, you can't kill a mod!
6sonata of awakening is...meh, not horrible though
Like Filly celestia or 80s cheerilee
12after that, the song has NO POINT
12lolz
6song of soaring is a horrible rip off of song of storms
You'll see Cog!
12I like how you learned it from the monky
I'll just check my friggin' command list and you'll see!
I prefer 80's Cherilee over Cheerilee.
12*monkey
Me too
6lol
12@Sonata
12and yah
12@Song of Soaring
You cant kill ME!!!
Let's see... "High Kick"...
love both cheerilees
OH NO IT'S DERPY.

!muffins
12they apparently NEEDEDX Kaepora Gaebora in that game
12-x
Derpy: KILL
Aww.
KILL IT. NOW.
12so they shoved him in as a side note
12just for that song
kill what?
6NWBN still makes my ears bleed
12XD
/me fires a Hadouken at Derpy*
/me 12doesn't mind the Elegy of Emptiness tho

12my army~
Cogweaver WINS.
eeeyup
12 1 statue being completely useless
:D
I like how we're all fat, yet for some reason everyone in our country hates fat people...
6xD
Well, not hate
*salutes* Commander CogWeaver, SIR!
But apparently it isn't normal
You guys hate yourselves?
/me is listening/watching the Demoman Ooga Boogas thing
At ease, soldier
Pretty much Rafasde
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QddbSEv41bE&feature=related
Is listening to this
.
12tho the best part
/me Gets out AK-47* HEY AM I TOO LATE....
/me is listening to Gobi's Valley theme.
12was making the Song of Time the most important
We make fun of ourselves so much, and then we point out everything wrong with our country and don't do a damn thing about it
But you guys are the richest country on thw world. Cheer up.
12tho it's children were meh
random question, favourite retro video game? (has to be pre-ps2/GC/Xbox):
Kalashinovs away, FOR NOW....
12the Inverted Song and the Song of Double Time
12Kirby 64
12@Nick
>implying Ak-47 has yet to be upgraded
Not the best, but the richest.
yes, Derpy, you're VERY late
N64 <3
AK-101, AK-103, Ak-107, Ak-74
12OoT a tie with it
let's try it again, okay?
SUPER MARIO 64! <333333333333333
Why do people only like Ak-47 again?
*puts Kalashinov in pack*
Derpy: KILL NON-MODERATORS
and OoT of course~
/me 12lolz
Because it was mass produced the most.
*shudders at Super Man 64
Yes
But I mean in videogames
6OH MY GOD KIRBY 64
12the poor Playstation 1 gets no love
6THAT GAME WAS AWESOE
12<3
6+m
It's always Ak-47
Because it got the most famous.
12it constantly battles with OoT
:P
But supposedly CoD is aiming for Modern Warfare
12and it deserves a 3DS remake
true lati, even though it sold better than the N64 and had its fair share of great games its never really mentioned much in retro gaming mags or videos
Yet Russia still uses the 47
AK-74u
the AVGN has only ever done one PS1 game
True
12XD
that game was god awful
xD
PS1 has Spyro 1 and 2.
But they already have even better than the 74
And you always get them instead of the upgraded versions because the upgraded ones are usually produced by MILITARIES.
/me sadly owned it .-.
*newer not really better
that game really is on par with ET atari
o.o
6ok
KYUBEI I LOVE YOU BUT I HATE YOU SO MUCH
AAAH QUARANTINE THEM! *quarantines SS
:'D
They should include the M8
:I
6time to go to the doctor's
6bbl
derp.
but yeah Spyro 3 <3
Russia uses the AK-47u because they produced it, and it's still efficient.
NO Nick
12kay Roara
12:D
*74u
I dont own it anymore
I didn;t play the first 2 but played the 3rd in curiosity, it was a great descision
12o.o
you mean the XM8 right?
yeah
also Metal Gear Solid, and the first 3 resi evils <3
More practical to produce than say, 101.
Didnt know if it got mass produced or not
Spyro 1 was pretty much my first ever game.
why are we discussing guns, and what does this have to do with ponies?
It did.
glumph o-o
idk
12A Link to the Past was mine oxo
i came back and people were talkin bout guns so...
The Soviets made a helluva lot of them.
Ponies are related to everything
12o-o
Super Mario 64 for meh
o3o
12super mario kart
We are trying to take over the world
The XM8 is less of a gun and more of a fish crossed with a super soaker
I just read Cupcakes.
but since I got my NES (and soon to be Atari 2600) I have some new faves notably contra
And I laughed.
:3
...
:o
12XD
good for you, ZaLOLer
So we need to know our weapons when we declare war on major nuclear powers.
12Okami 3D
12would drive me nuts
that game is just...EEEEH so simple yet just amazingly playable
12I need a NES D:
...
12tho
The XM8 was supposedly the US's counter to the G36c.
/me waves his NES at Light Lati teasingly
:P
12I beat Zelda 1-2 and Mario 1-REAL 2
I say we use the Kalashinov.
lol @ REAL2
Nawbro...I'll use a FAMAs
FAMAS*
I prefer Scar-L
Or Scar-H
12the real 2 never left Japan till...1994
It's fit for medium distances, and pretty inexpensive at that.
H is a higher caliber so probably that.
eh?
You people are boring. Ima go fight some ninjas.
I use Kalashnikov in shotgun format
xDaFreakshowx: Yes, but its mostly-plastic construction made it...unpopular.
The Scar is annoying.
I do have an atari plug and play game, missile comand is cool :D
Spyro1 here too, along with Pokemon Yellow lol
:p
oh
Which one is annoying?
Both,
12ah yes
FlutterHUGE: http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/9bbec3da7a8f7971b70977515db1575d/25677%20-%20absurd_res%20artist%3AAtomicGreymon%20fluttershy.png
Why?
oh yes how could I forget the original Pokemon silver, the game that introduced me to the franchise
12the rat's game
:o
12Yellow
:p
hah
13How can a pasty be "unsuitable for microwaving"?
I think quad rails are ugly no matter what they're on
SO CUTE
06o.o
13because that's what it said on the packet of the one I'm eating now
/me was a rebel and microwaved it anyway
and SS was even better <3
No one really cares about what your gun looks liek in combat....
The Scar... is wimpy to say the least.
AA-12
Which is why that TAR-21 exists.
It even SOUNDS wimpy.
also: behold cats http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/26288
How is it wimpy?
It seems pretty good to me.
L variant can use M16 ammo, and H variant is more powerful.
lol she gave her an umaibou :'D
lmao SS nickalerts me XD but i know your SS is Soul Silver
XD
12SS
12still playing OoT?
such as walking with pokemon and the sports arena
AA-12 is good for if you're in water or dirty enviroments.
Also, a major problem with the 47 is that it's recoil is really high
Still not very imposing when compared to other guns.
the cat thing is great
Ivan: Except it kept melting.
also...low recoil
The RECOIL?
What kept melting Larscis?
The XM-8
Not a problem when you're a MAN and not a WIMP.
the AA=12 is also good if you want to shoot exploding bullets
hehe
yes
Full auto recoil is bad man
Dragon's Breath rounds anyone?
For a fully automatic SHOTGUN?
But single shot isn't too bad
Yeah...
We talkin bout 47
Has spring countermeasures
Stop being a wimp and this is not bad.
I was referring to the frag-12 rounds designed for it
check out FPSrussia's AA-12 vid
lol
he shoots it one handed.
hello
Hey, the AA-12 is part of my standard loadout for visitng Pittsburgh. Even the TSA understands.
shame the pokewalker couldn't have been kept too...I bet any money sometime in the future, HG & SS with the walker are gonna be collectors items
The AA-12 is a monstrous weapon any way you slice it.
I prefer the 107, it's gas-powered I think and much lighter.
dragons breath rounds are't really good for anything buy looking cool and fouling your barrel really fast.
hahah
true...true
So..how long until Fireant designates this channel as a gun-free zone?
*but
xD
Also, wood on a gun just looks so amazing.
Until now...
No matter how impractical.
We aren't talking looks
We are talking performance
I know, but still.
Only REAL gun I own is a wimpy Ruger .22
but...at least it has a 60 round "Banana" clip
:3
and I am in very dangerous territory right now, because I have never shot a gun...
/me is too young to own a gun, sadly.
*derp*
derp
I own lots
!derp
Closest I've gotten is Arma 2.....
I've shot lots of guns, though.

"Apparently Valve is suffering the same fate as Riot Games. Various employees are sporting pony avatars, and their Official Tech Support steam group has adopted a Gorden Freemane avatar. For every negative press release we get, two major entertainment hubs convert to ponydom. I love the internet.
"
...And Fireant
And this is why I ban chat bots in every channel I moderate.
capt_slowpoke: meh
chat bots are fine

To be fair they're on Rizon which has a much higher retarded quotient

Chat bots are fun tho, like Luna over in brony or phrik on freenode.#archlinux

Sky Sanctuary it is.
so...I just realized...
wasn't the villa only available in platinum?
Oh, good point.

Well, still. I don't wanna use "Villa"

The twitter thing is @BronyState, right?
12Who Framed Roger Rabbit was by far superior
7I suppose Toph would fit my Excadrill very well. XD
every time I think of that I think of the Nostaligia Critic's review on that XD
7I'll go with it!
and totally, LL
12and Alex Lloyd was a demonic villian oxo
yes LL
13lack of reference pictures frustrates me .w.

thing is I wish AVGN was as consistent and still yet good as NC is...I mean AVGN just made his 100th vid, NC is now over 200 yet Doug really keeps thinking up new jokes and memes to suit the film he reviews
12all the AVGN relies on is swearing and profanity
12the NC has variety

people do say AVGN has gotten stale as of late, I do think that NC is overtaking him now but I still like James' vids, I laugh as much at the bad games as I do his slapstick and prop comedy
good aurora
12ohhhh I really want an ocarina still >3<
6I have one lololol
6it got buried somewhere long ago, it's somewherrrre
I actually remember the first NC vid I watched was his Cloverfield trailer video and I started following after that thinking "Wow this guy will become the new AVGN I feel..."
then he's actually making vids with AVGN xD one of the few things in my life I predicted right
12I saw Judge Dredd first
12THE LUR

12and remember the Zelda special item rule
lol
12wbs Roara
Dubstep: That reminded me of that Fairly Oddparents episode where the magic wish copier was jammed with real jam
hi aurora
hi
I figure that's the joke
12and now on to...
/me 12teardrop
12Volvagia
6volvagia <3
12the manga made its backstory so sad D:
12and Link's battle with it even worse
12;-;
6yep
12Floofy
12Hi Aurora
12OMGOMGOMGOMG
6o.o
12the 3D and increased visuals on Volvagia are AMAZING
12O_O
6lol I imagined they'd be pretty awesome
12and dead
12they were O_____________O
12and yay the power of the Biggoron Sword, making short work of both Phantom Ganon and Volvagia
6I wish I knew someone with 3DS
6I want to see this in person
12XD
12wait
13Same Roara
12i have a 3DS Aurora
/me 12suddently wonders what Bongo Bongo looks like o3o
12I have a 3DS :3
12what we don't count?
12and Twinrova
6*I wish I knew someone in person
13well there was this one time the 3DS was on display in a game store recently
13but
6oh god bongo bongo
6in 3D
13too many people crowded around it for me to see ;w;
12XD
6I would be scarred for life
12LOL
12giant hands grabbing, poindong
12*pounding
6we have a 3DS at target
6and it's easy to play, no one's there
12XD
6I get such a headache off the graphics though, one of the main reasons I'm not buying one
/me 12shrugs
12You can turn off the 3D
12even with my sensetive eyes, I'm fine after hours of playing it o.o
6ok
6that's one thing I don't understand
6WHY pay 300 dollars for a system
6to turn the 3D off lol
12Because the 3D is not what makes the games so awesome. It’s the games themselves.
but on most games if you shut off the 3D you are screwed
12Roara
due to perspective related stuff
12why buy a DSi if you never plan on using the camera
6the whole point of these games is to enjoy them in 3D
6which I understand
6internet
12for the games
12the camera is a perk
12as is 3D
6internet
12not essential
6internet
6I ignore the camera
6but the price on the 3DS is so ridiculous
04yes it is
/me 12nods
10Oh, Aurora: Not sure if you care, but I found a gif like the one in your TST sig that's not as close up and a bit smaller, if you want to use it :P </random>
so is the headache inducing 3D
6that would be awesome
6Angel gave that one to me
6but yeh it's big xD
12Eww DS cameras
04^
10http://i52.tinypic.com/2uii2oy.gif
6hmm, that's pretty zoomed out though
6like, more than I thought xD
6I'll stick with mine
10k
6derp homura in the back
10Stealing Kyoko's spotlight, that's her job
Ewww 3DS haters ;p
6she be trollin
6I don't hate the 3DS
6I'm actually extremely jealous
6I just can't stand that price lol
04Eww assumers ;P
04Roara
it's definitely worth buying
04unless you're lucky the 3D hurts you
i can understand if you wanna wait
I only want a 3DS for the GB games like Link's Awakening DX and for Ocarina of Time 3D.
04I'm ADDICTED to it XD
but I actually find the 3D to be awesome
12LOL
6the Wii was a full consol, not a handheld, and it was the same price lol
Does it still hurt you if you turn the 3D off?
Obviously not XD
no
XD
6no
I played one with the 3D on, and it looked like I had crossed my eyes. xD
6and the 3D isn't that bad, but yeah I can't go long with it
You never know, things give off weird waves nowadays, man.
04The 3DS is presumably as powerful as the Wii
6that's essentially what it's doing, you know that right?
evening just a short question
02Ohai Ihrida~
Ohai Ray. XD
04and Roara yes actually that's what the 3DS does
/me goes back to homework
04it takes two images and makes one go to each eye
Most of the games look like GC or worse than PS2 lol
Yay, I made a friend. : D
Evening.
But eh :o
12they're still starting out, Hyper
One of sitemanagement online?
04^
12unless it goes the way of the Virtual Boy
i was skeptical about the 3ds before it came out too
12it'll get better
Hmm?
04lol no LL
Luigi's Mansion 3DS looks good :P
but now that I actually own one
The 3D on Street Fighter just looked like a 2D image floating over a 2D background
i'm really happy with it
from the g-mail box :)
To me, at least.
12lol no what, Chime?
I guess that answers my question
12I meant if it flopped entirely
12not the red/black thing
Epic win.
I sent a message through g-mail which got replied. But I wonder what the status of it is
12LOL
12also
04oh
04k
12I think I unlocked the boss gauntlet
12o.o
04and LOL PD
I got 2 flames so far
nao what
04the theme song is one of the many things that kills the show for me
12the key
12keep going foward
12forward*
kk
Sorry, I don't know what your email is about.
12putting the Master Sword back looks as stunning as taking it out ^.^
The show tends to grow on you the more you watch it.
12lol
04HOW XD
I don't know. XD
04also THE NAMES
it was about a timer for the EU / US show
04They are HORRIFIC
12they infused it with caffeine and nicotine
with a countdown or something
12it hypes you up and hooks you
04LOL!
/me 12hides
I like the names. :P
/me 12suddently puts her head in her garbage can and makes noises
12I just saw
12the Happy Mask Salesman
12in 3D
A timer that counts down to what?
/me 12loses her lunch
12that
12is
12just
12SCARY
to when the show starts of course
04"pinkey pie" is NOT A NAME
Pinkie Pie is awesome. :P
Pinkamena Diane Pie is her full name.
04as a character I heard she is awesome
04but that name is
6We were considering having a clock of some form...
04gross
04x0x
12lolz
I could make one in flash easily.
Actually, I think I've already got one made.
/me 12turns the 3D off in the Happy Mask Shop x-o
04XD
6ohgod lol
o-o
04I cringe whenever I hear Pokémon's theme song btw
XD
6Well, we'd need DCD to put it on the site.
12I literally felt sick
04yet I liked it as a kid
12when I saw him
04I always hated the theme though
12that face
04so if I ever end up liking MLP (NO)
12is more possessed than any Redead...
12no
04I'll most likely hate the song with a burning passion
12well
04...
04LOL
12maybe
04I HAVE
04NO FACE
04;=;

It has spaceships and horses!
12oy vey
12the most powerful Redead still has its ability
rebooting cannot fix a broken keyboard, for example
Well I mean if the keyboard isn't being registered as there by the computer.
12how do you know it's the keyboard itself though
I was there for both last time
Hmmm>
that's why I said to run mskey
that will let you know
12too lazy
well, I missed part of Friday's so couldn't join the raffle
I hope to do so this Friday
Saturday*
but you're not too lazy to change your name?
3on my laptop, whenever i turn fix the volume using the buttons, it always gets stuck
/nick Helanga is more letters than mskey
12nickchange doesn't involve installing software
mskey is built into Windows.
ChaoHerba: probably the keyboard driver is corrupted, if they are on the keyboard
Otherwise, *shrugs*
3*sigh* so much technical talk
what brand laptop is it
12then how come i can't find any trace of it
3i'm LOST
uh
Watched a bit of it once when they put it on Singaporean TV
4 8 15 16 23 42
maybe mskey is the wrong command
hold on
Quick, enter that ChaoHerba
/me 3is flying around, waiting for this conversation to end.
Or else
DOOM
3nah
3don't feel like it
oh
I'll be away for a week starting Friday (no really this time, no computer).
3besides,
it's part of Microsoft IntelliType
3my name MEANS doom :)
which I use
6I find this awesome
I was about to ask if that had to do with Sailor Moon
but I saw mlp and now don't care
3a bunch of little Lady Gagas?
12drf green
/me 3flees
04drf
I don't see colored text on here.
12i didn't get any results when i searched for Microsoft IntelliType
the client strips it
um
04it's funny because there's no ponies in that picture :P
7Okay, ChaoHerba; I'll be heading to wi-fi.
12Ah, ChaoHerba is useing drf green XD
There's no ponies
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/258826

6it's funny cuz they changed the ponies into humans
There's HUMANISED ponies
12using*
3wooooah! major lag on my screen
6so of course there's no ponies
so does it have to do with sailor moon or not
7Okay, ChaoHerba? o.o
12o-o
Sailor Senshi looks like it came from that show :P
why would it matter?
damn
because SM is cool?
I hope you have a good time, wherever you're going
It is?
3uh yeah
it bores me
They should ponify everything
3i'm ready

/me 3flees
drf's on ignore over on my side
so he can be all fraked up for all I care
well Umbreon, some of us don't like when people change their names every time they join
"Take my love, take my land, take me where I cannot stand"
6I've got him on ignore too
