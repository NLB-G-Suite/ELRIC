HI OUTLINE
Hello Fiddler :)
6Oh, sorry wasn't paying attention.
6Thirty BILLION chats open at the same time.
6But it went quite well, except Starship Troopers was lagtastic.

that used to happen to me before too
O.o
HD encodes are difficult if you don't have a good desktop
toss some revives everywhere
Slow day.
O.o
/me 7D:s
Shame.
Oh, uh.
I can imagine
let's make it un-dead
but still
it's a problem that in the end was within expected parameters
but still man
since I want it to be indicative of the current streamer and all
i'm gonna kill myself
I have to keep it since I'm the channel's founder, though, but yeah
4Hey Cynder

6So, I assume I'm going to be doing Saturdays for a while?
hi
what's up?
hi

6I have nothing against it.
Frankly Saturdays are pretty tough for me
6Hey!
6Aaa..MW2 ftw. :3
There we go, external drive cleared.
Hey there CW. By the looks of things, nothing much.
12hi
Wow.
Whoever's writing those fanfics about Trixie and Twilight sure can... write. xD
augh terrible ship
Not really...
:P
Silver_Heart: which? ballad of TS?
I kid of course
The one about her and Twilight in the spa.
And then the one that follows that story up.
4Yea
5Hola peoples~!
6Well, that's fine.
6My schedule is as open as ever.

I'm about to propose something for when I get vacation time
I said I was going to try streaming every day, right?
well
first thing in the order of operations
7Hey, RP4L!
Yes, I am referring to the Cyberpunk Adventure, SNATCHER
5Was wondering where everyone was. xD
4Hacked?
5Falling Skies premieres in roughly half an hour. 8D
6Yeah..
it could probably be run through in a day or two at most
4Define hacked here
6That... would be amazing.
I like it

6Oh. I didn't see the nickchange notification... because there wasn't one. Oo
/me 5shakes her fist!!!! >C
6I'm looking forward to playing DMs again though.. :3
Updates probably count as news.
4Dang :p
6:P
5But it's only for a week. Then they'll all be gone. xD
02LOL RP4L
Hah
you got the unlogged one right though
The whole island is hooked on Cricket
Okay, whatever. "News".
7And on another note, I have MATH FINALS tomorrow.
I just didn't feel like it
there is news?
there for itis news to at least me
5They're goin' on about "The Best Show on Dirt", "The Road to Omaha", "The College World Series", on and on and on...
o.o

6Awesome :p :3
5Thankfully I don't live downtown by the stadium haha.
6I must say the vita looked quite awesome :O
4Yea

Heya RP4L, we have a two day holiday in July which is all about CRICKET XD

03*WB02(Aurora02)03WB* - <Aurora> 06I acknowledge I have issues, I am ok with it
"Cup Match"
Yeah
6I'm still watching it.
Oh DRF, when can you do the stream of TS3?
You'd think Ponies would drink beer considering barley would fall into their food
beer = yuck
03uh
03whenever
in any case
03not now though.
my friends
applejack can probably throw em back
Same here

6I'm waiting for Radiance to blow up in the face of my sarcasm, or something.
Applejack/RD drinking contest
course, applewhisky
lol hi RP
that would be awesome
4YAY my go goes to grab the man we need and i kill him
haha
applejack would win

yea, RD is too athletic
5But I really really really want to watch Falling Skies. xDD
lol RP XD

*joining
i had finals :P
8go on...

sadface
since this won't be "Movie Nights" per se
last year
4:O he keeps running even if i kill him
but then i get into grad school
I'm sorry Zen
eventually
:(
I was thinking on, instead, streaming games that are much more like interactive movies, as they last longer and can be said to be more involving.
6o.o
im still in high of the school
I have three games in mind.
5Lol, I'll be back in a few hours.
omg falling skies
welcome back
I kinda want to see that
03cthhhrchhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
ahem
5Roara, it'll probably be on the internets afterwards.
naw
yessss
conflicting information
I'm in college for one more year
shhh dont tell them
initiation begins as soon as u post
lol
8ok
5(And no offense but family kind of > IRC. ;D)
it is not midnight
u have to put up as much moonbase spam as possible
5What'd you get him?
aeiou
and we'll probably spend the night watching NCIS from the beginning lol
03wtf is Falling Skies
allow me to elaborate
these are the games
the first 2 seasons of NCIS and a Star Trek Enterprise bottle opener :D
5IT'S GOT
5ALIENS
the first and second would be Hideo Kojima classics
he's a trekkie lol
5 8DDDDDDD
03heh
5OMG ME TOO
5 /shot
you guys would get along well
from the beginning
6NO WAY I DIDN'T KNOW
the first, Snatcher, which was recently hinted to be getting a sequel in the near future
/me runs
6...
03no
6no lol
03go watch Scrubs
LOL Scrubs
03that's like the only show worth watching from 6the beginning
making it even more interesting as watching material
6not the entire thing
6SO MANY EPISODES
5Yeah ^
HI DRFAPTOR

DRF|LAPTOP*
Ouch
03LOL
6what
Purpose tyop
6was that
typo
I like being freaked out though
was that on purpose?
5That's like saying "YOU SHOULD WATCH ALL FIVE (six) SERIES OF STAR TREK"
Something strange?
HI!
/me flees
no lol
5"AND THEN ALL THE MOVIES".
I like metal
http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/policenauts/policenauts.htm
are you a silly enough nilly to rescue the president?
4XD
I've typoed drf's laptop nick as "drf|faptop" >>
I am a bad enough dude.
Hello, back again.
/me rages
03LOL
A silly dude at that.

XD
Gadget: Past as Future http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/gadget/gadget.htm
03then again
03mine is bad too
03but eh
*smiles*
You secretly like it
We're all bad
Somehow :<
03I only tend to misread, not miswrite
hence my bringing it up
XD
Yups
03so I'd make a slightly less defective hard drive than you :D
/me rns
03*runs
8i think my only issue would be if people are actually going to turn out to watch these
lmao
6For some reason I got reminded of this : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VkJpqKRjTw&feature=relmfu
Pretty good.
6:P
Although System of a Down is my favourite.
/me hides
;p
03not really
):
CONE
5Cone is back! :3
these are much more "movie-like"; though
It's been back
the entire time
And Disturbed.
Yeah
But why
just as Cone2
WHY?!
4Ha :p
Disturbed... now they... I dunno
:p
6:P
Nice to see the bots are all our overlords
Same.
which is nice
-> /os set superadmin on
Believe was the best.
totes
I have them all.
Ten Thousand fists wasn't bad either
5:|
Indestructible sounded like a... like... Ten Thousand Fists again
Although Serpentine is pretty addicting.
i know nothing about this
Nightboomfer: I am going to attempt a remake of Winter Wrap-up in that style
Indestructible was their worst album. Good, but still their worst.
Yes yes very yes
03I saw a whole bunch of trucks at the race earlire that said "KYU" on the side
5Oh, thank you. :3
03I'm being trolled
Oh U
/me Brohoofs Cyril
Next you'll see DRF
;P
I like everything Revolver. Except PopCountry
lets talk about RAVE!
Okay
I really like the style
ITs pretty intense
I can't stand rap.
toobad doubestp
6Yeah :O Actually I was just looking at it on Gamespot.. xD
03but good != hot
/me hides
Or Country, but I can stand rap less.
I like rap becuase of nerdcore
I like Outlaw country and gangsta rap
Hey!
5I don't need to look hot. Just presentable. xP
Greetings, Skies.
Did you see her pics again :o
I don't really CARE for Country, but rap annoys me.
03well I like when girls look hot :P
as you can see
Hot =!= Presentable
:o
got ya
hi southernskies!
their is no bad genres just genres with a lot of bad music in it
What's the conversation here?
the games are more about "watching" than anything else xD
I mean, it's not that it's BAD.
Zen: truth
Which means Hot = Bad
Yup
and they are still AMAZING as fuck
like country
Zen.
Gangsta Rap.
6lol
what
see, I like the band mushroomhead where they combine superheavy metal and rap
Name 1 good song.
>.>
you can say linkin park does that bu they are not superheavy
Anyone mind fillin' me in on the topic?
Straight Outaa Compton
5See y'all!
talking about various music genres
/me shrugs
03I've seen this episode before
bai?
Oh, I see!
such a good rap tuen
i dont listen to gansta rap
F*** Da Police
Like Gene Kelly.
4Same here
You've seen every episode now, haven't you?
8people might just write them off out of hand
also, the fact that they're Hideo Kojima's most underrated classics could also give some leverage
Well, just t'have a word in it then, I'll say that I like country.
...
6Comes out in November,right?
4Yea
We could sort of tell.
i hate a lot of country music
Not really. I mean, I live in country.
that said
haha
Er, texas
I do have a plan
Texas is alright.
But I listen to a lot of other things too.
Not as bad as here.
But alright.
6...this /meta/ thread is reverting backwards into stupidity again.
i met a ganster from texas
And now
rave is awesome
03brb
You'd be surprised. Everyone over here thinks they're 'gangsta'
/me watches SW=4
I like psytrance
Skazi
I don't get the obsession with skies here in the south.
I'd watch them.
I think it's kind of sad when you live in Texas and get made fun of for listening to Country.
It's because they're huge an open and beautiful out in the country
6Nice
and that is previewing it during an intermission in BMN...just the opening, though.
less things to block the veiw of it
You don't get the obsession with skies in the south?
and using that to gauge interest
I mean, I've been all over the country, and places like Florida have WAY more blue skies than here.
They're just plain gorgeos!
i like mane the best
er... gorgeous
Opressive, if you ask me.
for instance, I'm watching someone play OoT 3D.
8i would be fine with that
8see how people react
Nightboomfer: Probably a good idea. :3
With my hair, walking outside is like dropping a weight on my head.
6...I feel like playing Majora's Mask and streaming it now. XD
what kind of hair is that
A Anvilshaped one?
DO IT
Attention duelists: Look at my hair!
One with a lot of hair, lol.
YGOTABS reference
I lol'd
also
we could additionally run a poll
I'm talking about the fact that the sun beats down really, really, hard here.
texas
In the south?
Especially since I like how OoT 3D looks
Yeah.
hair = wieght by sunlight?
Alabama isn't fun when you're a nerd.
The sun ain't that much of a problem unless you're not used to it. I lived a while in San Diego and it was freezin' there.
Not my point.
Didn't get anywhere past about 70-80F
8good thinking
same, that and I keep mine pretty long
Well what're you sayin' then?
Not my point not my point.
my hair is pretty long to
8we could put it up on the FB page and then link it during the announcements or something
You know, I have the avalanche scene playing in my head right now.
Zen, don'tt you live in, like, Mane?
kind of afc
Man, that was one of the most epic things ever.
:D
?
yes i live in mane
/me 6is listening to the fail of the peoples when they see xcal on MW2.
sorry Barry
I think it's a good idea
but yeah
the summers are hot and the winter harsh and freezing
z's
Sticking every episode of MLP:FiM on my cellphone.
xD
6I like the poll idea...
have the preview run first
yeah
04blah
04(late hence the >>)
I need more pony songs on my iPod.
Not lately, Skies.
8we could run the preview during pre-show
8like right before the movies start
yeah, JUST before the movies
Or is he :O
8but after the EQD post goes up
but it has to be like
Lol.
8then link the poll
Oh, well that's a bit of a relief. I haven't been on in a while and she was supposed t'be drawin' my pony. :3c
8this /meta/ thread is too quiet...
A foot?
NO WAI
Only a foot?
8people are writing text walls I'm pretty sure
only a foot?
I know.
lol
In ALAMBAMA
People here freak out.
when I actually get the dates to my vacation LOL
Snow's srs bzns in the south
YA.
And sleet.
And hail.
Hail sux.
was.... in... 1974?
Yeah.
1979.
No wait, yeah.
1974.
Forgot.
I was close, though.
same difference
And last time florida HAD negative numbers for temperature was 1877
:/
He is
sounds painful
1877!
134 years ago
04o0o
sooo many dates
04*o-o
04where'd this conversation come up
I didn't know we had a /meta/ thread
1877 was a bad year
I'm heading there now
I have to wait outside that long in the winter, but not in HAIL.
4XD
8?
it was called the year without a summer...
04k
8its about something unrelated
6We're talking about a drama /meta/ thread...
ANd now we have too much summer XD
A year with a Winter.
Well it's not like it happened every day. It was just that once
Though it was like, pea sized hail
8sprinkles and i have been commenting on the thread
soo we might have our polar opposite
mane doesnt get hail that often
Yeah, but every day in the winter her is like, 2 degrees.
Annoying.
The year without a winter
Maybe I was ;>
Coldest I ever had was maybe 20F
that said
*here
I've been thinking
we should probably find a way to grow bigger
Colders TI ever had was 40 to 60 degrees
Stupid Tenessee Valley.
Hottest was a blistering 132...
i like to have all seasons
and I think DinkyPage is starting to be a bit too restrictive
we need an actual page
8okay
6Yeah, at some point.
8i dont even know where to begin with that though
with actual HTML Code Junkies
Summer up here is being relatively cool this year.
We don't have fall or spring, lol.
/me 7is going to sleep early today.
In Florida there's 3 seasons...
yeah, still not necessary
May went from 20 to 90.
but I expect that with our growth
No winter
we might start getting like
Hot, hotter, and rainy
500 viewers during the coming weeks
pretty mucj
sounds unberable southernskies
At the beginning of May it got to 20.
what
At the end it was 94.
Wasn't too bad since I was inside for most of the time, but it was pretty bad.
I've never played
dito
One time, Augustine got flooded
I used to play all the time
And I couldn't assess my school
Me too
it was on a monday...
kind of like Sweden
I quit a while back, but bronyville is making me want to play again
Problem fixed.
And hallways WERE flooded...
EHHHH\
Problem fixed.
8sorry, my attention is split right now
minecraft ftw
6And then the /meta/ thread went CRAZY
Yes, I know
seriously?
I built a town there
Quebuck XD
Wait, it does?
8well, i do think we should at least talk to !!Celestia about it
Ponification of Quebec
What's the server IP?
8maybe not specifically for us, but it seems like that would be a good board to have around

bloodisgood.org:25567
8and we were kind of originally born out of Ponychan
Creepy. o.o
you have to ask Gachl in MC Forums
6I agree aswell.
Lol.
let's wait for them to get some free time
I had a HUGE flood back in 2003
Oh.
THat closed my school for 4 dayd
I can't remember 2003.
I can I was 7
Not because I CAN'T, but because nothing memorable happened that year.
The hallways were flooded...
6Just a little bit.
6But he was just basically attacked.
I want in
8im kind of ashamed i was defending him/her
link me please, my browser is being a bitch
water pwns ass
11Rawr
8if you insist
8http://www.ponychan.net/chan/meta/res/13749.html
are you kidding? I'm a friend of justice. It's my job to deliver the hurt
it was like 4 feet amount of watter...
6I wasn't defending HIM, I was defending the idea.
At the end of the year this year, there was a full week, and then the weekend, and then the last day of school.
Hey, Anon1
nice
8i have never seen a mod openly call a user an asshole before
I knew it
and one foot of it flooded th school
The last day of school was a moday.
11What's going on?
the last thing a mod can do is take things personally
*monday
hence why I'm glad with our current mod force
And some of the kids had a surfing contest....
none of us takes things personally
should have known with the different colored text
8!!Twilight is trying really hard to get demodded right now
a mod must be cold as ice, and elusive as ether vapor
4ok
4Bye
6See ya tomorrow :P
8and i dont want to get banned
it's awesome
wooo
I don't think he has the time to try it out :P
wooooooooooooooo
But with all the guys that her show has attracted, done a lot for guys.
GAAAH.
*Super Ponybeat
oh noes
D:
Why not, Revolver?
11That's one mod.
No room?
i know someone with it on thier i pod
I dunno, Itunes hates it or something.
Anything can go on an ipod.
It won't copy...
maybe its just you rev
11I myself have had several but-ins with Spikemod because of how he's been hammering on the RPs that go on in /oat/
wek'
And some of the Chrono Cross OST.
Apple hates anything it can't control.
11But Everytime something "controversial" involving them comes, Whelp's there to throw accusations about the mod's.
I don't use iTunes.
Then again, I'm running Ubuntu 10.04. :P
Also, I can't get A Hard Day's Night on there...
Same here.
damn it
my browser's acting up
It annoys me.

Linkin Park - In The End IS MY FAV
I can't correct myself today.
derp
uggh lucas
Linkin Park is okay.
i added that to my ipod
a long time ago
In the End is SOOO OVERUSED, though.
and now i skip it when it comes on shuffle
EVERY TIME
I like it....
then take it off
yea...
SL is only really good if you already have friends on it. :/
i just hate deleting things
other than that it's a grief-fest
11Hmm...
But as everything else, it might get old...
11I gotta admit Soldier has a point.
Basicly, SomethingDifferent That right there helps a LOT.

Okay, back.

Yeah, I have Avast. WOrks well for me.

Just waiting on the editor to get another fic out too.
why you guys want RD as a lesbian...
Hehe "editor"

ZenEffy: The main audiences of both is female actually

ZenEffy and co, can we keep that topic to #EquestriaAfterDark
8then !!Twilight came in, called everyone children and called Whelp an asshole, then left
i miiiissssed you
4Well
4Whelp is an asshole
4No argument from me
Yaoi: dudexdude. Yuri: girlxgirl
8for great justice
buri is for gay guys its still like yaoi
[!umbreon vars reset]

it's etna
this was the main post that got me upset:
there is one of yoko though
I skimmed through it, but I have agree with the assessment. Twilight was being a downright asshole.
Hey, i'm just sick of this flankhole waltzing all over the place, making accusations and snide remarks everywhere. Don't blame me, i'm just doing my job.

perhaps
i would.
4I see
11I got a $100 charge on my bank account.
4It's fine with me
http://lmgtfy.com/?q=countdown
the content may be correct
While I agree that Whelp has become a bit of a problem for the mods, I think !!Twilight was out of line.
but that's not how you act when you're a moderator
9Well shit
4Okay, I think it may have been unprofessional and unreserved of him but I completely agree with that post
!!Twilight was WAY out of line
9also
11So no-go on the ad.
that would help a lot in trajecting my times.
9how many people have registered to the mailing list?

4So, I see that there's a application process going on for euro mods in the main room. Do us mods have to be involved?
No one mare should have all that power
The clock’s tickin’, I just count the hours
Stop trippin’, I’m trippin’ off the power
4I don't want to ask the room and sound like a jackass, I'm just curious
6Yeah, we're at 20, just added another one.

3,052,855 seconds until release of season 2 approximately.

For the moment, we're just putting word out.

Huh. I'm going to keep playing this Pony Touhou.
Until the release of S2
FUCK
4So come Wednesday we'll talk to them on a further basis
4What's wrong?
I FORGOT TO SCREENCAP THAT THREAD
I fucking knew it too
4Fear not, Hip. I still have the thread :D
can you cap it for me?
4I don't know how to screencap a thread however
at least the part where !!Twilight posted?
do you have vista?
It's an adventure.
6Alright, I'm out. Talk later guys.
9night Sprinks
cya

8about veemi getting blocked
oh neat
9I don't think Veemi is blocked in any country
9it might be their ISP
go to accessories
9not being updated
9the works
THere should be a button on the keyboard that says "print screen"
4PC
see if the "Snipping Tool" is in there
wa.
8yeah
4Yeah, I have the snipping tool
YES.
4But I've never tried snipping anything bigger than something that's smaller than a page
okay, open that up and then click and drag over the area
4You mean drag the cursor all the way down the thread?
4I'll try
11Of course the villains start showing up TODAY instead of YESTERDAY -_-
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/26116
no, just to cover the part of the window
this happens too much
fuck
i just realized
9in any case
wat?
9sent them a message in EqD
lol
define: "too much"
/me rawrs
all the time
11DCD, we were thinking of having the potential EuroMods come in on Wednesday for a brief interview
Hee hee.
oh girls just jelly because we are getting all the attention.
OH!
4I couldn't just drag the cursor down :(
yeah
Get a screencap of the LOCKED post.
Fox news, remixes, websites....
9sounds good
if the thread still existed, !!Celestia could have checked the IP or whatevs
9however
9keep in mind that also means that we need to set an interview time
it doesnt matter
9sadly I won't be home till like 6 PM EST on Wednesday
Can someone fill me in on the Fox News thing? Did they do a report on "bronies" ?
/me rawrs.
but older girls watch this show too
8works for me
Kinda sorta.
4I'd actually want to screencap for purpose of having it for future reference and lol
9oh yeah I should get to work on the BMN RD-Network page now
9I'll name it "BronyState" instead
-quote.
apparently Soldier requested that the thread be deleted
9considering the fact that we might host S2 streams and all
>download SL
thats good to know
>go to pony area
>See Actionhank
STill not enraging.
9well, bu that logic, we should also change the FB Page name
oh, good.
9but in any case, working on it
NPR always hinted at living in mom's basement and being unemployed
>_>
yes, he was
as far as we know
9I'll also make posts related to mod recruitan and Streamer searchan' in RD-N
9who here also has RD-Network?
wha-?
Ding Ding
9I might need group adminin' help
8i dont lol
02Makes sence.
8i know nothing about it
Fox News
can't get their facts right.
ORLY?
/me yawns and goes to sleep on Leafeon's head
every news cast can't get it straight.
ello
THEY FUDGIN' CAN'T
nope
hey RD
Fox news is the worst offender.
Which is irony.
*starts political flamewar*
11I never even heard of it until yesterday.
'cause Fox was supposed to be 'The answer' to the radically left media.
Fox is stupid
>get hosted on fox news
>Love & Tolerate the crap outta' them
>get hosted some more
That lesbian said it.
<RD> Fox is stupid
And the mass media is extremely centrist.
what lesbian
That lesbian said it right.
XD
i didnt watch the whole report
Did Fox do something bad again? Or are we still whining about the first two.
Haters gonna hate.
any leftward bias is most probably due to the fact that journalists have gone through college, and people with degrees are, on average, more left-leaning.
they see me buckin, they hatin
lolz
>implying furries are bad
That's unfair to everyone.
Exactly.

The one post that caused the /meta/ thread to happen.
sweet
11Sure.
WWI was for... vengeance?
WW3 :D
pretty much all of !!Twilight's posts
They might call themselves Bronites.
WW3 => MW3
then WW2 was for hitlers hate
WW1 was for.
yeah
Everything => MW3
it was vendetta
9something sleek, streamlined, attractive, yet eye-catching
revenge
Everything>cod
9preferrably monochrome
Then suddenly Dari out of fucking no where.
COD is just bleh.
http://images.cheezburger.com/completestore/2011/4/28/14453dd6-d545-44f5-b037-21a6df0b75d2.jpg
WW1 was for revenge, WW2 was for power madness
11AH! *fryingpan to Dari's face*
WW3 is for PONY CONQUERING
i prefer zelda over first person shooters
I think there was a bit of revenge in WW2 as well.
Retsamoreh yeah, pearl harbor an all
for we cannot survive without it.
like sleep?
11Monochromed to B/W without said ponies?
Sleep is in a couple hours. It's only 11pm.
Sleep?...Whats that?
It's that thing that.. uhh
My drama-sense is tingling.
well ****.
awesome
you're the man
What's a sleep?
i should sleep now, i have finals tomorrow
4I want to make something clear though
What's a sleep?

HCBAILY
ill use my name
AND LUFIA 2?!?!
yes.
Not really.
But I've heard of it.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qruO7SCO0FA&feature=related
He played Lufia 1 earlier, now he's ontto 2
i dont think seth's posted this yet
specifically !!Twilight
9that said, a base-color font for the title might be good, as well
...i demand more pony metal >: D
HCBAILLY FTW
11You don't like the rainbow for our logo? :P
pony-metal win
HC Bailey is awesome. <3
But I enjoy em'.
9it's not that I don't
He's nice.
!!Twilight giving shit because someone was questioning their judgement.
nice?
It really doesen't take that much time to do it.
Yes. Nice.
he's entertaining.
11That's the point. It stands out.
9what I'm trying to say is, we should try to make it look more fitting with the all-black bg
yes
...don't start this
THIS TOPIC IS OVER.
X3
tel me!
11Is it really that distracting when we have a stream up?
9well, yeah, it's good for it to stand out, but I think we should make it stand out in a different way
he called basically everyone in the thread a child, and then specifically called Whelp an asshole
Does anyone have skype?...
11Ah, I see where you're getting at.
Tell me! tell me!! tell me!!!
<-<...
9nah, I'm just saying we should try making it fit with the theather theme more
I think it's ok
*Trying to segway*
11ooooohhhhh
neva
okay.mpg
you could always make the bg match the rainbowness :/
: /*
11soisoisoisoisoisoi
lol
9hence why I suggested a monochrome title...that way you could use a solid color, like, say, purple, to make it stand out
because it was EXTREMELY unprofessional
5.....Now that was good TV.
ehh, if you want
11if you were being sarcastic.
lol
I was
Just glad to know others know of him <3
and honestly, if any of our mods here acted like that, they would be gone
5But SW6 was epically amazing.
and we aren't even as "professional" as Ponychan
Uhhhhhhhhhh
5And it was a multi-million dollar film. =P
Mind if I share me as a pony?
5LOT more money than a cable series.
4Again, I completely agree with !!Twilight's comment on Whelp.
Go for it.
11I'll come up with a few designs to show you on Wednesday.
4But that's beside the point, I know
gimme a sec P:
Yup XD
show yurself!
9awesome
9thanks yo
9that said
ihghinioppjhjbrgarhgaerhae ryhaery
9Hipster_Brony
tried to type fast with one hand
yeah
03and it's on TV :P
didn't worked.
http://i349.photobucket.com/albums/q368/michaelmon13/Michpony.png
http://i349.photobucket.com/albums/q368/michaelmon13/poniess.png
8yes and no
8we have it tentatively, but I want to change it
8because
8right now, we have both our movies in the 2nd half of the broadcast
03so/
03?
8and i dont want people to sit through 2 movies with no intermission
03I was made 20 years ago too
03o.o
velociraptor: is that a juicebox as yer cuitemark?
9I see. I wanted to post it in the RD-Network group though
Yeah um sw was made waaaaay long ago
5(actually SW was probably more like 25 but um whatever.)
1983ish
5Point is you can't compare movies to TV.
He's always drunk,
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp_K8prLfso&feature=related
:D
5THAT WAS ONE YEAR AFTER SIGNALS WAS RELEASED BY RUSH. /shot
9which is awesome
You can but its not a good idea
/me runs
I'm unimpressed with him
5Exactly ^
5Not a FAIR comparison.
11You thinking of putting a poll up in BMN?
His cheeseyness is the best part!
9however, we should probably make it an off-site poll
he uses an emulator, not the real thing
Opinion noted.
and he doesn't do anything that is challenging.
"Q_Q"
but, whatever you think is fine.
8spiders web, feeling pinkie keen, se7en, fall weather friends
9Silverscreen: I want to gauge interest in a non-Movie Night broadcast
9namely, of playing Kojima's SNATCHER
9which is by all extents and purposes, an amazing interactive movie
03so how about
9pretty much
03:D
11That was fun.
9we'll also notify the viewers of these off-schedule streams
5Naaaaaah, I'd disagree.
5I wasn't too impressed with that.
03amazing TV miniseries made about Terminator
I have, but never saw it.
Okay
9via the FB, Twitter, RD-N pages, the mailing group, and finally, during BMN themselves
Yeh
5And again, robots, not aliens.
03the first season, at least, was amazing
03I have both seasons on DVD
/me 5runs
03I should get the Blu-rays
03that would be cool
9yeah
03and hey
03who's to say this show won't get cnaceled
5LIKE ALL MY OTHER FAVOURITE TV SHOWS. O^O
'But I thought you -wantd- whining?!'
03not really
Well, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfy5W8AJqIY&feature=related. Don't be fooled by the beginning 16 seconds.
5Actually, less competition and less dependence on advertisers making choices compared to broadcast because people pay for television.
11....
03USA has shows?
5Uh, YEAH.
11so we need to figure out a set time.
5OMIGAWD
8ok guys, i gotta get some sleep
03and like, wrestling and crap
5BEST DRAMAS ON TELEVISION

03LOL

03My roommate's gf liked that show
5What looks stupid?
5D:
not sure.
03I watched one episode
11er, early
03and was like o_O
Haha.
03Psych looks stupid.
we celebrate 20m with ep 1
5But Dule Hill~ D:
Hi again, guys.
03who?
or 27, whatever u may call it
I know how much time approximately until Season 2
11Ah.
11Hi, Barry.
03also
03>Fangirling
5Shawn's partner! (He plays Gus.)
03= no
11That's cool.
Of course we'll hit 20m before S2 begins.
but I don't want to get everyponies hopes up.
5That is not fangirling.
Sorry I was away. I had just finished watching DBGT episode 64
03liking shows because of an actor? That's pretty darn close
It was bad quality
5That is freaking out over a legitimately good show in a world of stupid reality TV.
03completely different type of acting LOL
3,093,617 seconds until premiere of S2 of MLP:FiM
03in 300 she was naked, she's not in Terminator
/me runs
"Brony Blue"
DBGT! HAH
I was trying to remember this song
5And for the record it's an ensemble cast. I like the whole cast.
5I like the writing.
5I like the script.
5I like its originality.
O_O
03heh
03well
5And I feel the same way about all the other shows on USA.
03usually I just like the plot
03generally
I got the DTs, bad. I need more pony.
03stuff on USA sucks unless it's a movie
thats 3000000 too long
5To each his own. (;
9well
well, that is interesting
9with "Off-Schedule"
03it's all OMFG WTF IS THIS WRESTLING BS
9I kind of mean
5Leverage?
Just mass voicing/unvoicing is pretty inconvenient.
03now, they show NASCAR, which was cool because I was ther.e
9"Not at 7 PM EST Friday"
5I think Leverage is epic. But that's just me.
11I figured that.

C'MON MAMMA

O'COCKLE
My name is awesome. :3

04"There is chanting IT MUST BE OFFENDING US"
04>.>
9you might just not be that far
9plus it has spoilers
9Ace Attorney Investigations
Possum Face :>
6I LOVED that temple FOR that song
04and yes
04it was amazing
11I'm on the last case.
11Rising from The Ashes.
Uh no
03I thought it sounded annoying myself but I'm all for not being politically correct
.......
9oh
Hi
Oh man are you a face stealer?
or like a mimic
9certainly you won't remember it
Wait waht....
wtf is going on?
I win
You Didn't? :D
4Do you think it'd be the best of US, as mods ourselves, to really sink to the level that !!Twilight did and go behind his back and try to get him reprimanded?
9you should
same here.
12brbs
9probably play in this order
04k
Yes i do
Kosvoeon, once you get this soundtrack cd can you upload it
ha
same, until I found it
Well now I feel less derpy.
thought it was blocked advertisment from my adblockplus.
seeing as i dont have a 3DS or OoT3D
4There were plenty of people posting in that thread, whose to say someone didn't already screen cap it
I just never scrolled down.
lol
LOSER
BattleField 2 bish
*Battlefield 3
fixed
and counting.
9AAI is hard to find
ok
11Ah.
thing is
9Capcom didn't distribute it too well
it doesn't ship till like July 3
/me 11is using a ROM to play it.
:3
really?
and I'll be away for like a month on a family trip
Uh no
oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh
858 hours
51538 minutes
11AAI was the one you were streaming, yes? Involving the investigation on the plane?
after 2 months
that was a month ago
hopefully it was worth the wieght
;o'
season 2?
525, 600 miiinutes
i want it
since MLP:FiM stopped on May 6th
When is Episode 3 being released?
9yes
9precisely that one
Uh
I thought S2 was premiering in August/September
Valve time or normal time/
I demand to know!!
Actually, we do know.
We are currently not working on it
On a relative scale, our time preferably
Oh, you Silly Nilly. There was something saying Valve is heading towards Multiplayer games from now on.
S2 premieres 2 months after S1. on average
Bye!
Oh, that's too bad.
4Which post?
*brandishes a knife*
lol
Now to kill the wait
They'll finish Episode 3 whenever they feel like it.
:o
*slices an apple*
It's not good to rush it.
...
When they feel like it
"Hey, i'm just sick of this flankhole waltzing all over the place, making accusations and snide remarks everywhere. Don't blame me, i'm just doing my job."
oh don't you know?
"I'm just trying to do my job"
Valve can't count to 3
"when it's done"
This points to it being Twilight, since Twilight is the mod that's being questioned throughout the thread.
Uh no
I hope NO ONE buys
But the content of the posts makes it clear.
did i showed you my drawing with my open helmet?
9cause you're gonna need it for that case
bye
cya
11o.o
GTFO
11That sucks.
9if you're using No$GBA
They're both good
9there's nothing to worry about
MC is more creative though
but we wuv you
also i just found an OoT Remastered Soundtrack
9you can emulate it, I believe
9you just need it to blow
embrace the tolerance
trudat
11ah
9there are workarounds.
hopefully 1.7 Mc update fixes that
ok
:D
you suck at changing names
...
You suck at sucking
:3
Perhaps
That's a compliment though righ?
WELCOME TO APPLELOOSA!

*stare*
9Silverscreen http://www.nogba.com/no$gba-microphone.htm
... I'm tempted.
4...actually, !!Twilight made a mod post in the thread
Of course it loops
eyup
And I REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY want a forum sig of said ponies
Rarity is adorable even when she's whiny
Agreed
Heluuuu again.
how in Celestia's name is this looping
I say she is even MORE adorable when she whines
cause this is EquestriaDaily, it always loops
to the post in question*
It`s an act of the gods
*leers eyes*

Dangit.
I'd probably figure one out as I go along.
9just use
12blah I'm having no patience tonight ._.
9play a random sound
Man is it laggy today.
But those suck after getting, well, any weapon at all.
Besides Single Pistol
11I see that it has a microphone function, yeah.
9also No$GBA + No$Zoomer is the best DS emulator
L4D2
Or one
Both actually
Oh, i see.
9Scale 2x + hq2xS filter = HNGHHHHHH
I like Meelee.
9dat quality
11I tried that as my first choice, but the download link it provided didn't work for some reason.
but DP has the speed of an assault rifle but with unlimited power
I prefer Brawl.
Honk.
I still have my Melee
03:/
Melee is still pretty darned good.
03about that
03plz get on Xbox live
I don't like Brawl because Lucas is a wimp.
Banjo-Kazooie!
those vids dont appeal to me
HUZZAH!
its like brain over-load
OH DAMN. Droppin' Banjo Kazooie on us.
6ffffffff my usual group of people are gone
Banjo-Kazooie!
For some reason I feel as if a BK RPG would somehow work....
6I feel lacking lol
HOW
WHEN
Heluuuu
how?
lol
COMP SCHEDULE LOPPHOL"D?
Really now?

And besides, it's 10:45.
Texas?
I've got fifteen minutes.
I'm going now. I'll see you guys tomorrow. Same time, same place?
Banjo-Kazooie was an MMO and I didn't even know it
6but yeh, I'm usually skyping with them or my boyfriend, all of which are gone tonight it seems
BUT YOU...
I once dreamt about Banjo-Kazooie
nvm

Nothing happened though
You're confusing.

4You called them up verbatim
Oh Gawd. BKMMO.
I'd play that.
9night Barry
Seriously.
9pretty much
After that, we lost all hope for another amazing platformer EVER AGAIN
WoW oh how dumbed down it is now
Also, Whoopee Camp.
4Hipster said that Twilight called everyone children, that's most certainly not the case
4If that was in fact Twilight
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czNoQXwQ4kA OH LAWDY THIS ALSO LOOPS
I never got to play Tomba. D:
Tomba is awesome D:
of all time
I never got to beat it.
4All he said was that he felt all this arguing was going to fix nothing
Also when'd EB come bck o.o
back*
Conker would've one, but Banjo got to me first, and it has a wider audience
Yes.
*won
That would be the one.
Honestly, I never played Nuts & Bolts, but
it seemed to force a gameplay mechanism into a series that didn't need it
9I meant that for the
9obligatory parts
9with the fingerprint powder
I heard that Nuts & Bolts was pretty bad
But I do want to know if those very few platforming segments worked
4Nothing about children
4He didn't specifically berate the posters
4Except for Whelp
4And that was absolutely called for, IMO
oh hey someone named EBB
It isn't half bad.
i hate myself
How?
We always get derailed, if that's the problem
Do want.
Whoops! Back.

haha
That gif is more erotic than it has any right to be
Maybe my opinion isn't accurate
It needs wrenches.
But... whatever it is, it's AMAZING.

11I believe I"m at the part where I'm questioning the western ex-detective outside of the Evidence Room where the one murder took place.
NEED A DISPENSER HERE
MLPFIM movie.
4I don't feel comfortable with this situation
I just think that if the mod was being a douche, they should be called out on it, that's all.
agreed Night
MLPFIM movie, would be epic
but this was brought up the other day
and
Agreed
I second Night's idea.
Kinda the whole point of that thread.
its unlikely it would do well in theatres
TV Movie
Problem solved
9well
"THIS SUMMER.. ENTER A WORLD OF MAGIC UNLIKE ANYTHING YOU'VE EVER SEEN.
Or direct-to-DVD
9good thing I got to tell you before then
THIS SUMMER DISCOVER THE MAGIC
Direct to DVD would be epic
THAT TOUCHED THE LIVES OF MILLIONS
THAT NO ONE CARES ABOUT
I can say, that I would go see it in a thaeatre
lol
same
HAH
*DRAMATIC SOUND*
Whoa, capslock go!
That way they can have a series finale, without messing up the whole "The series can be watched in any order" thing
*MLP theme plays dramatically*
"...MY LITTLE PONY. RATED PG."
11Yep.

I want everyone to stand in the corner over there > http://kellywpa.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/banging-head-stick-man1.gif
NO
Mareyl Streep?
I just hope they don't do anything dumb like put humans in there for no reason
YES
YES
I REFUSE TO STAND IN A CORNER
Good Celestia, SillyNilly. D:

Oh wait.
LIES.
Maybe I'll start up my Desktop Ponies.
They'll never release
Team Fortress 3
4He didn't exactly say that though
/me hits rimshot
Ha, you misspelled Battlefield
If everything can be improved by ponies, does that include movies that have starred Shaquille O'neill?
4He said "the majority of people here don't act like adults"
No.
Some things... just can't be saved.
it repeats,
yeah. again, it was in response to Whelp, though, which might have influenced that comment.
Anything that starred Shaq can never be repaired
Eh
TF2 is mindlessly fun
improved*
I am Kazaam!
Mechwarrior 2.
Shaq Fu?
But the manner it was stated in kinda ticked me off.
I prefer BF3 because of the immersive environment
12aaaand finished the survey
5People still here? D:
I don't care.
TF2 can't do immersive, only fun
6yes
/me 12lols
12in both of the boxes
And I have other games for that.
5Yay~ :3
12I wrote them novels XD
I dunno if I'd WANT TF2 with a story.
Although i really should play TF2 more
That was sort of the point of the recent "Producer" comic they did, wasn't it?
*players
Producer's trying to make their lives all dramatic...
XD
12"Why did you want OoT 3D?"
But it's not immersive
"I. Like. To Shoot. Gun. Is all you need to know."

12was that I saw adult Link on the N64 version and...

I forgot
lolwut
5Oh gawd. xD;
12and then I said something like "anyway..."
Someone said something about 2nd seasons being released two months later after season one on average
and everything in between is just random.
12:3
At least I don't think I do....
:/
4Perhaps I'm just more pessimistic than you are
...before I go, a little teasing:
Possible. I'm known to keep a positive view on things.
Take care.

4This entire discussion feels like a courtroom discussion
:3
Rrty
condensed
4Repetition >_<
cdnsd
I just noticed that too.
Since some kids shows DO have relationships
cndnsd spk fr th wn
How long until they start doing relationships that "wing the other way"
In kids shows
that would be interesting
But it happens in other kids shows
Like spongebob and Fairly Odd Parents
4If it was !!Twilight mod, in fact
Not all the time, but it's happened before
lng*
not lang*
dammit
My Little Consonant: Disemvoweling is Magic
lol
It would probably have to start with implied relationships
Although that's arguably already happened
Where 6686?
HAHA
...Ren and Stimpy?
I dunno
I doubt that
Although that isn't exactly the best example of a kids show
Awesome as it is, it was extreme for a kids show
Right, I'm tempted to make a half Special on RN next week, where most of the show, but not all of it is dedicated to OoT Music. Thoughts?
Yeah I got nothin
Right....
But yeah, I think implied relationships would be the start
....wow. I managed to think of the weather without thinking of pegasi ponies for the first time in weeks. XD
12noooo
They've already gotten full-blown ones in movies and shows, although mostly stereotypical...

サンボクス
If you were born in the early 90s you tend to view the shows you DID see as SACRED, and the shows you didn't as wtf why did people like this...
Hence why i don't really care for most shows pre-1996

I came from the Lackadaisy fandom, where that sort of crap is commonplace
Lackadaisy Cats?
Lackadaisy
?
yeah exactly
She was our GoH a couple years back.
It's a webcomic that despite never getting updated, is still one of the greatest ever
yo
She's pretty baller talented
She's fuggin' hilarious.
reminds me of VG cats when it was still updating
Whom?
huh
Cut the bold out.
hey random
Vg cats no updates anymoar?
Barely
braely
yeah
Ya
once a month
Grooves, Lackadaisy is one of my favorite things.
But yeah you'd be surprised at how insanely active the lackadaisy RP board is compared to amount she updates
i wasted my entire evening looking through their comic archives
It's a really passionate fanbase
Me 2
CUT THE BOLD OUT
BARELY updated
That seems like it.
erm,
no
bold is mine
Cut the bold out.
Erm, yes
so....
BOLD
Stop bolding.
...
oh you poor poor attentionfag
But yeah, I'm making some pony jazz music
That doen's affects anyone
tsk tsk :(
It's going to be adorable and amazing
XD
Prestigi Comoski
Jazz?
Curious.
although pony bop would be applebuckin hilarious
I'll have to look into that
So......Season 2 out yet?
no
no
October
stop remind us
isn't it?
lol thought i would ask neways
December i though
Random. you were told to stop bolding.
I thought it was November.
what's with these typos
Hey
DerpyGrooves, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSzPbO9DFcg Like that kind of Jazz?
that doen't affects any rule

I shudder at the thought.

It always creeps me out
i got it working
Shaico: would you like to make a contract? :3
And the worst 'animation'
and made it ironic and hilarious?
I never thought I'd see grown men buying girl toys, but anything can happen. o.o
Shaico: go watch Madoka
:p
laaaaaaaaaaagzilla
Oh yes.
i don't watch anime
It's japanese powerpuff girls, and it's weird
lol
It's not just weird.
It is a parody of anime
japanese powerpuff girls is ppgz
It's /fantastical/
In anime format
Its a REMAKE
PPGZ IS HORRIBLE
DerpyGrooves: thats not really a mg show :p

Okay it turns out it's actually made out of whatever sort of plastic that the figures are made out of
I would protect my ice cream sandwiches...
then how would it be flexible?
The figures are bendy-ish
And they are probably warm.
Guys I stabbed myself with a compass. help
thats lame
Evening everypony.
Hi PaintSplash
I just needed a bandaid.
Greetings Fireant
You act like I stabbed it all the way through my bone.
Well.
"stabbed" can be taken many ways.
*shrugs*
Bonżur.
You too?
Ouch.
Did that in 2006. Hurts every know and then.
ouchie!
...but they fixed it with superglue.
A friend of mine slit thier hand open a while back coring apples....luckily no tendon damage
Ouchy
Got mine carving a pumpkin.
Tendon healed nicely.
DerpyGrooves, are you on here via the website?

DerpyGrooves, http://img815.imageshack.us/img815/8587/tracyart.jpg
Nice.
that is too ungodly cute
yeah it took me a second to realize it wasn't glasses lol
Yeah she is. She's also just fun to hang around.
I had to watch the dealer's den for a while, and chatted with her.
She puts on this very professional exterior, but you don't have to dig far to understand how goofy she is, a lot like her comic.
Well you can just tell she's brilliant from her writing
Oh yes.
Like, that one poem she did for Dithyramb
I still have it memorized because it's really, really good
Remind me?

I've got a feed to Lackadaisy on my homepage. :P
Never missin' a beat.
I use Piperka to manage mine
Xiagu: Same here, for several of them, but I -do- have an excuse.
Oh really? An excuse? Let's hear it.
I have WAY too many webcomics that I like...
o____o
Whoa.
/me only reads 22
/me is a readaholic
*nods* Same here, PaintSplash.
Fluttershy is cute in anything
Agreed.
12o.o
I dropped off reading VG cats a long time ago because he ceased updating for months at a time.
/me nods
Anyone read "Sequential Art"?
I do
I do whenever someone links me to it
I should get around to starting from the beginning ._.
it recently went into one of its plot tumor arcs again
well hi again
That is something with that comic...these arcs happen that don't really do anything overall.
Hey.
...
/me tabs back in
sorry, you guys make me go catch up on webcomics :P
[22:59:33] <PaintSplash> Anyone read "Sequential Art"?
welp
now I have to read 700~ pages
THANK YOU
I'll just leave this here. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSlnZxvi37s

I guess I'll have to start playing fighting games now.
Wait.
Is this
funniest webcomic maybe ever

qwantz is too repetitive imo
THANK YOU PROMINENCE
that's the poin!t
qwantz = Dinosaur Comics
YEAH
*yeah
And back it up.
I make a webcomic...but I'm not really keen on sharing it with all these other great comic names...
I should browse ponychan more often x.x
Kinda fun having more than one pen name
*cough*

That is great.
I still do.
Homestar hasn't done anything for like a year
I haven't been there in ages.
I still wear my The Cheat hoodie in the cooler months.
My fantasy is that the bros chaps are in talks w. cartoon network to start a show
I hope.
I'd say the environment is pretty rececptive
People got crazy pissed about that thread
yeah lmao
Which thread? This shit's loading slow.
Crazy-pissed?
Hahaha
wait...what happened?
wwaaat
...
Oh dear.
She gave it to the little girl she takes care of in her spare time
Not sure if that makes up for it.
I can't believe people were suggesting "kill her"
Eugh...
Yeah it's sort of the same thing, but at least the girl is having fun
yeah lol little bit of an overreaction
where'd you get that info?
It was pretty silly.
Nothing, aside from buying it.
nothing
it's the EqD topic change, you surprized?
"Oh, I threw it away. It's garbage."
Thousands upon thousands.
s/many/many known/
Nice to assume something is just garbage...
The lost Rarity.
For shame.

are you kidding?
me too
i thought i only had FlutterBro

Hard to say Mara.
watch the episodes, enjoy ponies
Like ponies. Fun show.
Good fanbase.
I beat Dodongos Cavern
k
lol
*opens guide* >.>
fail
x.x
I know.
XD
"Why can't I stop watching this"-ness
oh dont worry
Characters with character.
I mean I guess its okay for a kids show and all, and I like some of the characters but I feel like the setting's kinda bland atm.
shes gone the second half :3
it's only been one season. they need more time to develop it i think.
then link wont end up hitting on her .-.
/me RUNS
Agreeing with Balloons there.
xx
But it's had about as good a start as one could hope for.
I think most of the reason to stick with the show comes from the fanbase.
any admins here?
lol
boomerang
Sorry.
etc
Flutter_Bro: irc.lightirc.com
i never used a IRC
Ehh... the fanbase might die, but at least in it's lifespan it's produced some brilliant fics and artworks.
target it
Thanks!
that helped xD
XD
That's fair Maren. And you're right about the show being predictable.
Pernament
/me goes after the last Bomb upgrade
There's just something likable about the whole thing. Can't quite define it.
Flutter_Bro: yes
unless they inactivity timeout
Parasitic Tentacle?
oh
oh
yeah XD
i have a horrible way of describing things XD
I've only seen about five episodes and found it to be predictable, too. I'm having a hard time getting myself to wathc more because of that
I think lightirc's nickserv clears 30d inactives
just until they leave
Yes.
3 more of those ;3
You still watch them though
oh lord
or is it 2?
2 or 3
how
Speak for yourself. I can't stand watching any predictable shows
What's there to understand? We are fans of the show and we group together at these fansites
To each his own.
@Outline well said.
oh
I GOT THE COMPASS :D
Maren personally I enjoy the characters and setting over plot
Definitely the characters
lolk
that's becuase it is a kid's show. if there to subtle then kids wont know whats going on.
Well maren, it IS a kids show. You have to expect that it's going to be reasonably predictable.
RAINBOW DASH IS AWESOME!!!!!!
Yes.
That was a Pinkie Pie level of explosiveness
/me hates around the room
I would recommend reading some of the higher-rated fics if the show itself doesn't appeal.
/me turns everyone into cars for no reason
Oh my *adds smilie to his collection*

03no
03I said I like watching WJBK

Ahem.
03fan != fanboy
03'there's literally a huge difference
but hey, drf
just use
03well
03it's misrepresentation of information
03and when people keep bashing on a station for being "FOX News"
03when it's nothing of the sort
You hate MLP:FiM
But do you need to say
EW MLP
in like size 30 font?
... >>;
@ drf
03eXAKR, why not?
Then I should also be able to say
03if someone made a thread about that
03then sure
in 30-point font on the forums as well
Ew 5th gen >:
03but if you just did that randomly that would be thread hijacking
03I have an Xbox 360, but I also have a Wii
03and I admit they're evil
03o.op
03-p
Apple is not as evil as you think
03yes they are
They are just as bad as Apple
lol why are you using "evil"?
Corporations.
:3
that's not really a good way to describe it
Are by default, evil
03MLP is made by a corporation
03I think that about sums it up
/me hides
nao to find a 4th one for my 6th heart slot
lol, evil = causing destruction
lmao
oh come off it you two
just /ignore each other
or something
did you...
03I hate /ignore
drf
then use something like
play Sarias Song for the Skull Kid?
12lol
where is the skull kid
in the Lost Woods
03Ascendant that's basically the same thig
03*thing
once you enter the woods
effectively that's ignore but it writes eXAKR's lines to eXAKRtext.txt
and well
you could get it to echo the text
turn left
into another window
03or I could just not bother
03:P
well
and go thru that tunnel
you guys should seriously stop jumping on each other :D
I mean
stand on the stump
It is quiet now.
it's not that I don't encourage it...
/me hides
snd play the song
*a
In the future, because it's 4:35 am.
You mean its 10:36 am.
easy heart piece
Fireant, what's 10 am like?
Got it

hmm
/me hides
03I saw that
You could participate in some form of commerce.
If you want people to stop hating on you
Kinda.
Then stop hating on other people
same goes for drf, although he doesn't exactly hate on other people
Take that and rub it in his face first
;p
no events, no GMs that make things happen?
I joined SL in 2005 and still pop on from time to time.
No.
03and no, I don't hate people, only things
03until an iPod can get up and tell me I hurt its feelings
03I honestly don't care
mh, dunno, not my genre... i'm more story oriented when i RP
And if you purchase in-game currency, you can buy things.
Oh, you could set up a story RP.
Gotta get participants.
And you gotta keep out griefers.
I can't stand both Apple bashers and fanboys
as usual
03LOL
Keeping out griefers is half the fun of SL.
03well I hate basher bashers
/me faceclaws
pegasi fly?
in SL
no, just 3
Everyone flies.
Oh

03that was actually accidental
*facepalms*
if you don't want to, too bad
the rest can heal u
just put up with it
Everyone can do it.
ok
You know
Someponies bounce.
arguing isn't going to help anything, lol
You are an ADULT
You can get vehicles to fly around in.
they respawn
03eXAKR, I don't whine about you unless you start randomly harassing me
Can mock up battles in X-Wings.
03so in this case, YOU are starting it
03I don't hate the games
03I hate the creatures
And A CHILDREN'S CARTOON that is enjoyed by ADULTS
Some even have scripted damage and blow up.
k
mh.... ok, i think i got the genre of gaming
thanks
not sure if wants, i'll see
cya
Heh, there really isn't a "genre" to SL.
Adios.
are they in bottles?
.-.
CRAP
if not, theyre gone
leave the pool then return
MMO?
they respawn
i dont have a bottle tho
catch one in...
a milk bottle?
you HAVE to
yes
MMO kinda implies an objective.
drink the milk
then use the bottle to catch a fairy
i got a fairy
same goes with however many bottles you have
k
12drf
12i would probably say the same thing
plz x.x
MMORPG would.
03but if I leave, that lets him win :|}
03-}
no
sometimes you have to lose
I guess.
12i never mean any offense to anyone
and it's not necessarily letting him win
thats you needing to go
with all the good and bad that comes with it
BOTH of you are being immature
03LOL
03anyway
12Light_Latias i'm a boy
I know

Bottom of the Well and Ice cavern
:3
I am ashamed to say that I have one password set on 90% of sites and comps xd
I just use easily-connectable words.

For example, one password is related to the other by way of synonyms.
Ditto. I only have one password, with variable numbers at the end :(
i usally write them down and hide them in a notebook, that REALLY keeps my memory of it, cause i can always look in the notebook, and i'll remember that i DID write it in the notebook X3

03then I'm sitting there watching entire lines of scrollback

I don't play any of these Zelda games that were being talked about.
Hence, they know about france...
Did you see me whining? No.
13I just don't say anything about any subject until I've tried it myself
Hence...Equestria exists
13THEN I say my opinion
13:3
03I wasn't whining

03for banning someone that's breaking rules?
12right when they join
8we have a few people lined up, but we still want more alternates in case anything goes wrong
03Yeah, OK, that's totally not doing my job
03I know
03I was going to gline them yesterday
03but they left
03so I was like
03whatever

6ok granted, I wasn't here
drf, lighten up

6oh
6well
6then go ahead lol
Aww.
12ok
03#2 is she refuses to use proper English
Yeah when Fluttershy was telling Rarity in Dress for Sucess
03when we tell her to every time
12that I'll accept
Improper english too :<
03she says antyhing
03*anything
03exactly
French Haute Coutre sucks, though.
03and people just call me mean without even knowing the whole story
*reads the buffer*
They replicated our technology
12you're saying things
03but that Nick said not to
03unlike her, I don't answer to him
12and not everyone was here

Ain't gotta explain...
Nuff said.
Okay

Or we live on, but are on another planet.
And Ponies, given time, SHOULD be able to create time machines, working off our technology, right>

7This would be an inappropriate time to add a reference.
03this is like the third time now
6it's one thing if it's just how a person acts, but age rule is strict
pretty sure I'll be at uni around that time
More like X-Com

03but does that ever happen?
MOVING ON

Ponies made themselves sentient by time portaling back to our time and working with top scientists.
It's happening at an alarming pace already
03that was one reason I found #SW annoying for a while, since we had all these young people
Twice a day Saturday and Monday*
03but thankfully we don't have to worry about that anymore LOL

You

You're kidding?
12there's a slight difference in the N64 game's Forest Temple theme and the soundtrack
12's
Lucifer was an angel.
A third of the pony host banished to the moon
/me dives behind cover
EVERY
TIME
IT MAKES ME LAUGH

6the doo doo doo doo part?
Not really
/me 12nods
6....how ever i should type that
6yeh
12they used the soundtrack's one >_>;
Lucifer wasn't evil.
:o
13I always find it hilarious when people try to hum parts of a tune in the form of text LOL
Because Lucifer was an angel like Luna, an then became evil.(Nighmare Moon)
XD
Same AE
I can't argue religion with you guise.
12it should be a slower doo doo doo doo doo
12but nooooooo they used the fast 2-doo
Why are we arguing about religion?
/me 12-.-
6Fire Temple chant wheeeeeeeee
^
6I really should stop listening to music and go to the doctors
12I DOUBT that'll be in here
YOU
*is Protestant*
RELIGOUS PONIES
6same
12since the blocks
why are you guys arguing about the most cliche'd, most stereotypical and most futile argument in a show about animals as the main characters?
12lack the crescent moon and star
CATHOLIC PONIES
Hey, Fassad is a McDuck?
and now we're talking about religion?
How the F*CK DID THIS HAPPEN.
12no idea
Interesting.
12if I knew how
I DON'T KNOW
Topic Change GO
Judging by her behavior, she'd really prefer they didn't.
BUT AS LONG AS WE'RE NOT FLAMING EACH OTHER'S RELIGIONS, I SAY IT'S FINE
12I would take both of them from the N64 copy
and

I feel a kick coming on.
12yush :O
12when they're evil witches :P
12as opposed to innocent potion makers

6I was dissappointed with the music
Well, you reacted
12and he was like WTF
12LOL
12good one XD
It would have something to do with the freindship flowing.
aaaaaaaaaanyways
They're just all the same.
6lol @that
12Stone Temple <3
12err
6...
6tower
12*Stone Tower Temple <3
6wtf lol
I can accept this.
Dune 2000 was cool.
One is just more balanced than the other.
6I was waiting for a punch line
12lolz
13LOL
I like it when strategy games mix it up
Try Dawn of War.
Or World in Conflict
12I kinda like Termina's theme o.o
Applejack is the best pony, don't discuss
12tho
Applejack is the NICEST, not the best.
Applejack and Rainbow Dash are the best.
X-Com was really unique
12I HATE how it starts off like Hyrule Field's
Rainbow Dash, yes.
X-Com was AWESOME.
6they're not nearly as interesting as OoT
Apple Bloom?
/me 12nods
Really?
6oath to order is ok
^
Apple Bloom here.
12yah
Favorite pony it's Rainbow Dash. PEGASI.
*is
12but >_> Goron's Lullaby
6song of healing goes without saying
6...god lol
Applebloom is DEFINATELY the cutest pony...but not the best
But I think the best pony is Fluttershy
12and that brat you learn it from
Applejack is the best pony
Either way all the coolest ponies Pegasi
We can agree to taht right?
12so boring it put him to sleep just singing it
6STFU
6seriously
/me 12hides
12XD
6he doesn't STOP
http://s1223.photobucket.com/albums/dd502/Immortalshippo/?action=view&current=Pony17001.jpg
12and when you win/lose the Goron Races(which I admit is fun)
ಠ_ಠ
Cog: srsly?.avi
Apple Bloom is most definately cutest.
12HE gives the speeches
Pegasi = coolest
Apple Bloom is the cutest. Agreed.
^
Fluttershy is the best pony
AB is still cute tho
And RD is the awesomest Character
yep
no one remembers....whats her name again?
no
NOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!
not the worst, but most neglected
"No"?
I think she's the sister of that one pony no one likes
But I still have her on there....
COG YOU ARE GOING TO DIE
6the song of time reversion and compression
6whaaaaat >.>
6and yeh, that one was horrible
The CMC are worthy.
6I seriously hated NWBN
Fluttershy is not, apparently.
Or Pinkie.
I have EVERYONE on my desktop, minus duplicates
Or Rarity.
Silly chatters, you can't kill a mod!
6sonata of awakening is...meh, not horrible though
12after that, the song has NO POINT
12lolz
6song of soaring is a horrible rip off of song of storms
You'll see Cog!
12I like how you learned it from the monky
12*monkey
Me too
6lol
12@Sonata
12and yah
12@Song of Soaring
You cant kill ME!!!
Let's see... "High Kick"...
OH NO IT'S DERPY.
http://bronibooru.mlponies.com/data/sample/8150a7d00cdf97c47ef3af7a8274fbae.jpg
12-x
Derpy: KILL
Aww.
KILL IT. NOW.
12so they shoved him in as a side note
12just for that song
6NWBN still makes my ears bleed
12XD
/me fires a Hadouken at Derpy*
/me 12doesn't mind the Elegy of Emptiness tho
/me uses AMERICA to win everything
6elegy-
6yeh
6I was about to say that xD
12wheeeee
/me uses Equestira to beat AMERICA*
6BEN

*slaps Ivan*

NO
/me thinks that America (USA) is fat.*
KILLAMANGARO!
lol
12my army~
Cogweaver WINS.
:D

Well, not hate
But apparently it isn't normal
You guys hate yourselves?
At ease, soldier
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QddbSEv41bE&feature=related
Is listening to this
.
12tho the best part
/me is listening to Gobi's Valley theme.
12was making the Song of Time the most important
But you guys are the richest country on thw world. Cheer up.
12tho it's children were meh
Kalashinovs away, FOR NOW....
12Kirby 64
12@Nick
>implying Ak-47 has yet to be upgraded
Not the best, but the richest.
N64 <3
AK-101, AK-103, Ak-107, Ak-74
12OoT a tie with it
let's try it again, okay?
Why do people only like Ak-47 again?
*puts Kalashinov in pack*
Derpy: KILL NON-MODERATORS
and OoT of course~
/me 12lolz
Because it was mass produced the most.
Yes
But I mean in videogames
12<3
6+m
It's always Ak-47
Because it got the most famous.
12it constantly battles with OoT
:P
But supposedly CoD is aiming for Modern Warfare
12and it deserves a 3DS remake
Yet Russia still uses the 47
AK-74u
12XD
xD
PS1 has Spyro 1 and 2.
And you always get them instead of the upgraded versions because the upgraded ones are usually produced by MILITARIES.
/me sadly owned it .-.
o.o
6ok
:'D
They should include the M8
:I
6time to go to the doctor's
6bbl
derp.
but yeah Spyro 3 <3
Russia uses the AK-47u because they produced it, and it's still efficient.
NO Nick
12:D
*74u
I dont own it anymore
I didn;t play the first 2 but played the 3rd in curiosity, it was a great descision
12o.o
you mean the XM8 right?
yeah
More practical to produce than say, 101.
Didnt know if it got mass produced or not
Yeah, that project was cancelled, but they made a LOT of prototypes.
It did.
idk
12A Link to the Past was mine oxo
The Soviets made a helluva lot of them.
Ponies are related to everything
12o-o
We are trying to take over the world
And I laughed.
:3
...
:o
12XD
good for you, ZaLOLer
12Okami 3D
12would drive me nuts
12I need a NES D:
...
12tho
The XM8 was supposedly the US's counter to the G36c.
/me waves his NES at Light Lati teasingly
:P
I say we use the Kalashinov.
lol @ REAL2
Nawbro...I'll use a FAMAs
12that dream in Subcon doesn't deserve the 2 >_>
FAMAS*
I prefer Scar-L
Or Scar-H
12the real 2 never left Japan till...1994
It's fit for medium distances, and pretty inexpensive at that.
eh?
xDaFreakshowx: Yes, but its mostly-plastic construction made it...unpopular.
:p
oh
Which one is annoying?
Both,
12ah yes
FlutterHUGE: http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/9bbec3da7a8f7971b70977515db1575d/25677%20-%20absurd_res%20artist%3AAtomicGreymon%20fluttershy.png
Why?
:o
12Yellow
:p
hah
13How can a pasty be "unsuitable for microwaving"?
06o.o
AA-12
Which is why that TAR-21 exists.
also: behold cats http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/26288
How is it wimpy?
It seems pretty good to me.
lol she gave her an umaibou :'D
XD
12SS
12still playing OoT?
Still not very imposing when compared to other guns.
the cat thing is great
also...low recoil
The RECOIL?
The XM-8
Not a problem when you're a MAN and not a WIMP.
the AA=12 is also good if you want to shoot exploding bullets
hehe
yes
Full auto recoil is bad man
Dragon's Breath rounds anyone?
But single shot isn't too bad
Yeah...
We talkin bout 47
Has spring countermeasures
Stop being a wimp and this is not bad.
I was referring to the frag-12 rounds designed for it
check out FPSrussia's AA-12 vid
lol
he shoots it one handed.
hello
The AA-12 is a monstrous weapon any way you slice it.
I prefer the 107, it's gas-powered I think and much lighter.
hahah
true...true
So..how long until Fireant designates this channel as a gun-free zone?
*but
xD
Until now...
No matter how impractical.
We aren't talking looks
We are talking performance
I know, but still.
Only REAL gun I own is a wimpy Ruger .22
but...at least it has a 60 round "Banana" clip
:3
and I am in very dangerous territory right now, because I have never shot a gun...
/me is too young to own a gun, sadly.
*derp*
derp
I own lots
!derp
I've shot lots of guns, though.
haha

6to turn the 3D off lol
12Roara
12why buy a DSi if you never plan on using the camera
6the whole point of these games is to enjoy them in 3D

6I'm actually extremely jealous
6I just can't stand that price lol
04Eww assumers ;P
04Roara
it's definitely worth buying
i can understand if you wanna wait
I only want a 3DS for the GB games like Link's Awakening DX and for Ocarina of Time 3D.
04I'm ADDICTED to it XD
but I actually find the 3D to be awesome
12LOL
6the Wii was a full consol, not a handheld, and it was the same price lol
Does it still hurt you if you turn the 3D off?
no
XD
6no
I played one with the 3D on, and it looked like I had crossed my eyes. xD
6and the 3D isn't that bad, but yeah I can't go long with it
You never know, things give off weird waves nowadays, man.

Hmm?
Luigi's Mansion 3DS looks good :P
