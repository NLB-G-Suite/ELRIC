Actually, Starswirl was the father of the Amniomorphic Spell. This comes from Amnios, or roughly Cup, and Morphos, or Shaping, suggesting that magic is shaped in the same fashion as a glazier making a cup. In other words, StarSwirl the Bearded sould be called... a Hairy Potter.

WarpWhistle: ponies do not exist in this Cartoon
how bout Tigersharks
It was all about street sharks with me :)
fail
I'm back
had to restart
the strings are not broken
Jawsome!
and damn it all my ANT isn't compatible
Simon: I've seen bears and gators. How can we be too sure....
talk about high tension line
speaking of physics...
I think street sharks was around when I started watching cartoons ironically
WarpWhistle: so are they ponies?
Pinkie Pie?
Because that show was shit.
07,01physics? which physics?
4th wall again
What is a Physics?
07,01no idea
Tovler Bro/][\Hoof
/me 07,01yawns sleepily
lol "A" physics
I have forgotten what Physics were
i don't know, i've never heard that word before
sttreet sharks, the cheap knockoff of extreme dinosaurs
Physics? Ha that's funny
A miserable pile of secrets
dem SFXs
bah
How does decreasing the quantity of money decrease its value?
idunno. I liked how the people knew the Street Sharks used to be teens. They could have gone for the secret identity thing, but they didn't
/me Tailspin was the only Disney show that actually acknowledged physics
Simon: I don't see why not, especially cause most disney cartoons of this era existed in a world where all cartoons converged, like Roger Rabit or Bonkers.
Luna: night dear after this if I forget or miss you!
Luna stay awake u are master of da MOOOOOOOON!
Chip and Dale Rescue Rangers
Xtreme Dinos was awesome to. I still have my T rex toy with lether jaket and bike chain

WarpWhistle: eh, I don't see any ponies in this cartoon anyway
1:17 on EST
Lunarletic: 2pm
RoflBot: same here

/me 9:17 PM for me
only 1am where i m at
12:17
ponies would get old if we watched it the whole time
I recall having a precocious crush on the archeopterix

I looked at that pic and it hurt my eyes
Phase4: when are you gonna sleep?
MY EYES!
I've heard of it.

not sure
The Roseanne-esque duck reminds me of the fat witch from the MLP movie.
probably 22:00
Nothing can stop the smooze
Dino Riders
Does tommarow's episode remind anyone else of that spongebob where Planton tries to make Spongebob more assertive?
10pm to 4:50am... 6 hours of sleep only
Not the smooze!
yes
07,01dinobabies anyone?
Dinobabies?
07,01und fregglesrock or however you write it :P
/me 07,01yawns
Luna: never seen it, sounds ok
Fraggle Rock Luna
Simon: its that or 0
Holy-... that sounds familliar.
I was still very baby during fraggle rock so I barely have memories
Fraggle Rock was awesome

Luna: Rainbow Connection makes me cry..
Ohey! The title sequence just came full circle!

The Muppet Show!
AND it does not suck her up
/me tears up now that he remembers the song
Simon: Darkwing Duck, you foal!
Simon: well she's very large
PinkamenaDianePie: I mean this tool
The Muppet Show of course and what I miss the most is The Jim Henson Hour
suction.....too.....strong!
This show is bat s*** crazy.
It's time to put on makeup
Luna, guess what? TO THE MOOOOOOOOON!
07,01barbapapa
Phase4: The physics are so cool in this cartoon
yes. thats how a vacume works
Simon: Oh. Sorry most people around here have been asking what this show is and I am getting irritated at their lack of a childhood.
wow, I do not envy whoever has to clean that up
PinkamenaDianePie: Wasn't born when this cartoon ended
PinkamenaDianePie: so what's this show called? :P
But I saw the title
This is Duck Tales.
lmao
/me was born in the 90's
/me Darkwing Duck
Darkwing Duck
1996
Facepalm at buytoast.
dem toots
most of this stuff didnt air here in aus
/me was born in the 80's
pinkamenadianepie: i was only exposed to this show when it went into syndication
lol bubbles
Phase4: If I had more caffeine I would be pleased to assault you.
heyo Buytoast lol
It's obviously Duck Tales; they are ducks and having an adventure.
/me hugs PinkamenaDianePie
And greetings, MahBoy777.
cool physics are so cool
she has a fat laugh
fail
/me farts
/me Duck Tales was a different show, but same universe
excuse me
Buytoast: same universe at least, launchpad is related to Scrooge
/me p[en a window
lol
lmao tovler thats so ignorant its funny
Buytoast:This arguement is what all chats strive for.
Ducks have no bones!

No, she said OH taku... <.<
As a correction, they arent tripple-think glasses.
It exists.
Japan did exist
Japan existed...past tense
Ok so how can otaku exist in their day and age? o.o
space otaku
How can latin exist in our day and age?
same way amish can exist in ours
because it could refer to people obsessed with anything

So...she was always a girl even if they haven't announced it

thundermane: yh, I know.
6_9
Okay, when you first saw Ed, did you really think she was a girl?
...
Why do i get the feeling these people are going to kill me?
I thought the movie was okay, but I thought even the worst episode of the TV show was better than the movie.
Lol.
Ed is both genders
I already knew.
They were
00,10the dogfight at the end of the movie was great.
00,10as was all the music.
polydunami: i did, i just couldnt figure out what she was doing with her arms

It's a Pinkie Promise.
Ed is like if you fused Trixie and Zecora and Pinkie Pie
Girl.
I control the horizontal and the vertical.
It's called not knowing a person's true gender
Pinecones?
ed is like pinkie pie with zecora, no trixie though.
lolface
Girl, for the third time!
Just tell them to wait for the end of the episode...they reveal it then XP

Well, I will be back for ponies in the morning.)

Silver_Streak: well, it's more for the audience then the movies usually
That makes no sense.
Silver_Streak: No I'm seriously asking are you cereal?

Sumica: flat*
I thought bronies were genderless now
fat line :D
ponibas its become a colliqual term?
fatline :D
i thought fems were pegasisters
Dat yay
Ponibas: Some prefer to be called a Pegasister, but I prefer using Brony as an ambiguous term.
brony stands fo /br/ ony so no. brony is for all
you and your fancy big words.. and your fance.. small words
big words THEY HURT
holy shit.. unintentional troll
Polydunami: I think fatline was about two gastric bypasses ago :D

Brony stands for older fans of the show
Oh my
Redline

I would clap if I wasn't holding cheeseburgers
Placebo: I have?
11,01I always though brony was a portmanteau of "bro" and "pony."
It's still Black Lung!!
Placebo: I didn't know that was you.
not noodles
Yeah
otakon: We played ME3 together. -_-
Nittany, same here
Placebo: I know, but I didn't know who was saying what in that match

He said it was actually pretty good
You can build so damn high O_o
oh gawd this guy, hes like the hulk if the hulk got stronger the sadder he got

00,10MACHINEHEAD!
I came for Indiana Jones.. and just forgot to leave?
sumica, lets watch NGE next week?
he has his own INTRO?
I didn't believe him because MLP was a girls show, right?
MACHINEHEAD is best brony
law, theres a 1.2 beta and a 1.2 patch
Ugh. 400 kb/s?
Thundermane, it's not a Guilty Gear knockoff...it's made by Arc System Works, the company that MADE Guilty Gear
Well, it is, but it still didn't stop me from watching it
Yup, I'm home.
sumica the english 1.11 or 2.22 movies, not the episodic one
my brother has blaz blue
dammmmnnnn... still no results from my CISSP exam
looks amazin
stream seems stable now
hahhh
PAWNCH
oh shit
00,10I belive we are saveing Rebuild for an event.
He's dead.
this is getting REALLY crazy
sumica what kind of event?
/me shrugs
/me I have 2.22, I need to get 1.11
wait
OtakuTom: so they spent there money on a crappy remake instead of Guity Gear X3?
haha
Actually, I became a brony around the time of Sisterhooves Social
XD what's with the random YAY?
you're tearing me apart sumica!
Lesson learned
Or something
So this is going to start making sense at some point, right?
I find BB to be better than GG
Not only does yelling make you stronger in anime
00,10Trust me I want to show them.
SO DOS CRYING
it's Sumica's ping
Sumica: please no, it's so damn depressing
They took what they learned from making the GG games and improved on them.
otakon: end of evangelion changed my life
SuperBrony64: heres the yogscast video http://youtu.be/uLvNBB5kyY8
otakon: it has exceeded crazy
00,10fist full of teath
so
damn
depressing
Sumica: You should play End of Evangelion
I tried getting into Evangelion
Death/Rebirth and EoE were so messed up.
<---actually understands NGE
just so otakon could get depressed :)
otakon, how do you really feel? =p
First impression: GO AWAY SHINJI.
no, really after reading up on NGE, it's damn depressing
1.11 and 2.22 are both pretty good, though 2.22 really goes into some crazy dark places.
Well he was being nice
First Impression: SHUT UP SHINJI AND STOP BITCHING
NGE was the first anime series I owned on DVD.
i just read that as Voltron
"If you don't move i'll go around" that's pretty reasonable to me
00,10formy understanding we are waiting for 3.33
tired eyes are tired
Shinj suffers from unwanted-child syndrome, of course hes a bitch, his dad made sure hed be one
otakon: EoE made me so depressed I thought about suicide
Like no lie
TOY_PON3: thus I don't want to watch it
I don't really like a weak-minded protagonist tbh
EoE is that the movie where everyone turns into LcL soup?
PWOTAGONIST
i
I love insane hot blooded protagonist.....Lets Watch Getter!
Which is why I'm skeptical about harem animes
am aparently going ot press enter to soon again
otakon: I asked myself, Why do I keep on living if I may never find happiness? Then I found ponies and you guys :)
Lunarletic: Gurren Lagann
/me meh Eva is Eva, and Shinji will always be a little bitch
/me is going to go do school work
PONIEs
nah overdone
TOY_PON3: good point
:3
Phase4: see ya!
/me updated minecraft, realizes no friends have updated servers.
T_T
I want to watch Puella Magi Madoka Magika XD
DeadpoolDash its not his fault :[
ding me if you need me
awwww
Lunarletic: WHT?! NEVER! THE BUCK it's overdone!
Egrus, that is a pretty good show
It is
Egrus: another depressing, nihilistic show. no thanks
placebo, hey. hey, come here.
00,10it gets intersting around ep 3
/me paragon hugs placebo
otakon: I'll watch Lagann hen only and original series for first part
Lunarletic: well, okay I can take that
/me BSN_Brony Paragon +7
/me of course not, he was just written, draw, and voiced that way
drawn
I watched it only because of Studio Shaft
@otakon: not as depressing as Bokurano
the original's Giga Drill Breaker has more impact than Gurren Hen's
I haven't felt that at all when playing BB. I love the stories behind the characters, and I think each character is better developed than the ones from GG...heck, the only characters I can remember from GG are Sol Badguy and Bridget.
Egrus: never heard of that one
xD
I've heard of Bokurano
OtakuTom: what? no Potemkin?
the most depressing show ive watched is the iron-man anime last year...holy crap wtf were they thinking?
00,10suddenly sepia
Is that the one whose opening is Uninstall?
/me you want to watch an anime and be super angry at it at the end watch GANTZ
@otakon: just the premise is enough to break you down
Bokurano
Oh god no
BSN_Brony: what was so depressing about it?
Not Gantz
..........
Egrus: fantastic, no thanks
dude stole his hairstyle
toy_pon3 it sucked so bad..i wanted to cry.
:(
00,10there was some mech anime that was realy depressing like that.
otakon: and what about axl and milla and sol?
I want a strong female character
o_O
00,10like every othere ep a main char died or went braindead.
thundermane: I know, it's just I remember the characters but couldn't recall the names, and CLIFF!
sumica lacrosse plus?
I was gonna say GaoGaiGar but I think you guys would'nt like Yuusha
00,10I cant recall the name right now.
Probably Bokurano, Sumica
can't be as bad as my parents were
GaoGaiGar is king of meh for me
*kind
Dang typo changes everything
00,10nah it was on some island.
Sumica: old or new anime
otakon: and testament and slayer, BuCKING SLAYER!
00,10late 90's early 00
Sumica: hmmm
So who here likes Elfen Lied?
Eh...
Which one was that again? I remember the name.
You mean the romantic splatter anime that involves two cousins?
i missed boobies.. didn't I?
No
sumica battle royale?
Sumica: the only animes that come to mind is when the seagulls cry which is fairly recent and another which is coming out now
Potemkin, or however you spelled it ^^;
Thunderpony: Yeah
No.
the one with the virus that causes horns
/me Mezzo Forte and Kite
Sumica: and boogiebop phantom
also, i never got the * no naku no koro ni
Elfen Lied was great...I still haven't finished it yet, though.
Who here has seen the Kite movie?
Excel Saga!
I have a ton of things I'd like to watch. How's Trigun?
I love the Higurashi anime.
lol
Sumica, you should get Blood +
Trigun is pretty funny
otakutom spoiler: he marries his cousin.
Egrus: ending is weird, but it's hilarious.
Egrus, jesus it's damn nihilistic
At first
Has anyone else watched Another yet?
just Another anime u mean...
Another what?
xD
exactly
That's the title, "Another"
I accidently the whole another.
So is anime all nihilistic? XD
00,10the opening was done by the same group that did heroic age.
hello
assassin in the house!
egrus more or less, they try to be edgy by posing psuedo moral dillemnas
Wait, Vision of Escaflowne
oh shit!
jesus!

Holy crap
00,10cops dont mess around.
otakon: your headset ever come in?
Holy mackerel, did that anime have good bgm

Wait, video games are artwork?
Egrus: which one? at least those have a glimmer of hope in them. that one you showed me is just depressin
Actually, I've seen Okami, so yeah

Wish I had Placebo..
@otakon: The first SNES one, really primitive bute it's all already there
