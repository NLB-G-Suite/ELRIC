03and I was like oh, right and removed it
03XD
down to 7 pages left x-x
03This is like
03one of the best quotes I have ever seen
03<Casey8> Diana Ross' husband died
03<Tarrier> how
03<Casey8> fell while climbing in South Africa or something
03<JennAway> that's sad
03<Bubbaprog> i guess there is a mountain high enough
03I've been quoting that IRL and forgot where it came from, but there it is
2 pages x-x
and someone misread my tweet as (Full House) of the Dead. *late*
stupid mIRC froze
03LOL
03Full House is a stupid show, so I would love to see a Full House of the Dead
03it might be more entertaining if I got to shoot Bob Sagat or whatever his name is
03:D
Bob Saget as a zombie.
03exactly.
=win
03I'd play that.
someone thought it'd be a great future version of the sitcom
XD
03<Fraeon> I have found an awesome reason to become emo
03<Fraeon> You can celebrate all those days you weren't born instead of that one day you were
funny windows, very funny.
For some reason, when I did a repair on my 7 partition, my Documents folder become a system folder and was hidden
fixed it though, whee
First time that has ever happened to me too
03<truefalse> I was at the bus stop and saw a poster of Voldemort with 'HP 7' printed on it.
03<truefalse> Kind of spoils the ending when you know he's low on hit points.
how many horcruxes were there?
:V
03over 9000?
03<Algorithms> I bet you could pay a person from india to act as an IRC bot for you, for less than a shell account to run an eggdrop.
wow

I'm okay
thanks for asking

oh yeah Drake
04?
I got an A-A+ for my short story
about Rhy/Nathan/Leonard
had some punctuality errors
04Oh nice
04Can I read it?
didn't
I already give it to you?
It's the one where Rhy hides in the cupboard
and bawwwwwws
04Oh
04that one yeah
yeah
Wasn't even that good
04It was profound. Which doesn't really suit your writing style IMO
hah
what context of profound do you mean in this case, Drake?
Intelligent or descriptive?
04Intelligent
oh thanks, Drake
04XD
that makes me feel awesome
good to know my usual writing style isn't intelligent
04You know I'm here to please you

/me slaps Drake
/me dodges
what do you mean by "profound. Which doesn't really suit your writing style"
):
hi
ohai
04like
04you seemed to be going for a more emotional reaction. In your usualy writing (ergo Reminiscence) you're blunt and tell it like it is.
04Hey NS
04You know that thing
04on TST
Ah
04the "TST Couples" topic?
oh yeah
04Can we end that thing
I don't think anyone really cares
04because it gets annoying everytime we bring up couples in the chat and I have to pretend to like you and I can't say who I actually have a crush on
/me hides
and it's kinda awkward to say "hey guys, we decided we don't like each other anymore"
04fair enough
/me stabs Drake
XD
/me teleports
well, people actually say that?
orly
04not much anymore
04but suddenly the TST couples topic was revived by Rocket Ninetails so I thought it was a good chance to make Arti take that down
heh
hah
well
hmm don't remember the last time i logged in
I'm too tired to decide this week
to those forums
04This week
and I can't access most sites anyway
>DER laptop
04Your laziness is truly glorious NS- oh
only reason I'm on mIRC on the DER laptop
is because safe mode
I'm also running PuTTy and VNC
fun
/me is awesome
04yikes
/me high fives Iago
/me ^5s too
I also have a theory
that a portable version of firefox
will get around the bluecoat proxy
seeing as it only seems to affect IE
but
that could easily just be port 443/80
actually
it is
theoretically a proxy should bypass that
but it doesn't seem to work
so
maybe it'll work on firefox
and IE is gay anyway
04o-o
I'm just having issues downloading firefox
because blocked sites
and proxy is being derpy
04the webquest we had to do during AH today wouldn't work on Firefox
04so I had to use IE ;_;
Ah
._.
I miss using linux
windows is so slow
04XD
but I can tolerate it
because yeah
>DER laptops
>finding workarounds
:D
only thing I don't like about safe mode
bbl!
04Whenever you type DER laptops
sorry for being all not here and such:<
is the fact that I can't seem to access google
at all
04I actually think of you saying "DERR!"
which sucks
04Bye Espeon
hah
seeya Xeli
but yeah Drake
seriously though
I can write in most styles
I just choose to write things in different ways
04But you don't usually.
Reminiscence is a completely different style to that fic I wrote for english
because one, that fic needed to be profound
for marks
and two, Reminiscence is more about action
and reminiscing, thus the name
and philosophies
it'd be weird in that fic's style
04I named the first chapter of DoI "Reminiscence" because it's the only thing that fit that wasn't obscenely long.
Ah
04It was originally "You're not much of a Femme Fatale" but that's too long and doesn't really suit it.
hah
well
Reminiscence does need more description and detail tbh
most of it makes me cringe
it's not the sort of fic that really shows what's happening
but rather describes and /almost/ tells but not quite
04hurr
04The problem with me
04is that I don't really have a writing style yet
I shift writing styles depending on the occasion
I can write in almost any style
04I try and fit as many descriptive words in as I can, so when it's mostly speech (which it is rather often) it feels bare.
and obviously I'm better at some than others
I suck at starting and ending
04And the use of adjectives isn't always good
my endings often feel rushed
and my beginnings can feel a bit unanswered as well
and yeah
speech is bare
unless you do it well
apparently I did it quite well in the Rhy cupboard fic
04I do it poorly.
04at least IMO
but that's because Rhy was being a whiny bitchy kid in a tantrum
and that's easy to write
04Can I give you a piece of a chapter and have you tell me what you think?
yeah
04one sec
do hurry
I haven't showered
I still need to play piano
aaaaaaaand you smell like 1 2
04:<
okay nevermind that line
but uh
04wait what
I need to sleep early
I'm exhausted
04yeah you do
And I need to get up at 5:15am tomorrow
cus' band
and the day after
and I have a maths common test on friday
soooooooooooooooooooo
I'm screwed
:x
wing it!
04haaaah
04NS
04I got 20/50 on my maths exam AFTER I corrected some marks
04also
04http://pastebin.com/xu7EsQ7N
04also I'm screwed for my English Ext speech
04meant to be 6-8min and I think I barely reach 4 minutes
._.
just uh
repeat things
and talk slowly
asshole Drake
no no
04Talking slowly is my best hope
you're meant to do it as unlisted
not repeat things
not private
go into unneeded details
04I'm putting on a british voice to sound weird
/me slaps Drake
unlisted
04and drag it out
not private
for pastebin
/me avoids
04ok ok
04It used to be private
/me changes
hurry
need to go soon

04there
'exercise,'
should be 'exercise',
04oh
1.It wasn't long before they finished, and at the conclusion of the exercise Irres was panting heavily at the strain the forms had caused.
probably make that 'but' instead of 'and'
or well
'but even then, at the con-etc.etc.'
to put emphasis on the time and stuff
04uh-huh
“Besides, all I instructed you were that it required a body part with key importance to your being, and as a dragon your tail is incredibly important for balance.”
should be was not were
comma after 'body part'
took me a while to figure out what you meant
you need that comma Drake
but very, very few dragons can focus their magical energies enough to project flame, ice or lightning from their nostrils.”
that extra very kills the flow of the speech/sentence
get rid of it
17.“And how would I focus myself enough to summon fire upon my tail?”
18.
19.“That relies greatly on what you use it for.
that makes no sense at all
topics are completely different
make it a logical answer Drake
“I…The function of my tail is of balance, to keep my body from falling to the ground or losing control when flying.
that of isn't needed
"The final, and perhaps most important use of my tail, is in order to convey my feelings and emotions at the point in time."
no need for the in order
When I am happy, my tail swings from side to side slowly. When I am angry, it quivers. When I am afraid, tis tucked between my legs.”
should be 'tis not tis
same with Irres' next line
“Well done Irres.
comma after done
other than those grammatical errors Drake
it's pretty damn good
anyway poof
04ahdayvukbicnf
/me fixes grammar
04and thanks
04Cya
no probs Drake

12brb
Hello.
7Hey guys
7Eh, I guess the place is pretty empty right now, huh?
7I guess I'll see you guys around then
7Hey Dari
7can't really talk. playing SR3
Ah, ok
7Ok I'm done blowing up the implausible flying ship of implausible.
12ohai
hi
hi
12ohai SkylanderDrobot
7'Afternoon, everyone.
12hi Rivus
Hey.
7Everyone alright? P:
12yep
7Good, good.. whatcha up to?
12nothing much tbh XD
7Haha XP Me neither
12looks like this place is starting to fill up with users
7Yep
So long since it was active in here. :/
7Eh, I wouldn't know, I joined yesterday.
7I've noticed how empty the forums are though.. hm. I was eager to chat 'n roleplay in there.
12you should still try
12needs the activity
7Oh, I will.
12As much as I respect the owner, he’s not really playing his part in keeping this place active
7Again, I wouldn't really know.
12maybe that will change if he sees more active activity
12-active
7Maybe. If someone/ I made a good roleplay I'd be very active there.
7And that would probably revive the RP threads a little, and the activity would expand. Maybe.
SR hasn't really done much sitewise for a while.
He switched to a new host fairly recently.
But as for site updates, nothing.
And he won't give admin powers to any of the mods.
7Hum..
He's not really interested in Spyro any more, but he's keeping the site up anyway.
7Ah. Well, we should be thankful for that at least.
Yeah, he does pay quite a lot to keep it up, I just don't understand why he doesn't give admin powers to some of the mods so someone can actually do something with the site
Whoops
7I better go. Its 2am and my eyes are burning. Seeya round, guys.
Cya
7Byee xP
Yep. :<
I wonder where SR's got to, he doesn't even idle in here any more.
12yeah
aww I missed someone >.>
I havent seen him idle in a real long time
I would hope that this place doesn't go back to what it was last month
12same
Its nice to see someone new join here, just gotta hope it will continue
/me runs
12jk
lol
12I bet SR will do that :/
:/
I need to idle for a bit, bbl
12see ya
back
12wb
12LOL one hour late
lol
yeah exactly one hour
are you still doing classwork?
12not today, fortunately
12XD
:P
Ive been on spring break all week
12I wish I got breaks
I didnt really get to do much though, was busy doing other things
12do you have MK7?
12(Mario Kart 7)
nope
12ah
you wanted to play?
I have starfox command
but havent played that game in a long time :P
PS2 for best console of all time
Then gameboy colour because pokemon blue/silver.
Why PS2?
Because it's the top selling console of all time, has literally thousands of brilliant games, plus all of the great PS1 games can be played on it, and because PS2 games are still made to this day, and the console is still sold to this day, which is a hell of a lot better than any other console is doing, or has ever done.
If you wanna talk about a system that can play older games theres the gameboy
the gameboy advance played all GB cartridges from 1989
and up
I never thought the advance looked as good as the colour, don't know why, it was just weird and wide, though I did have an SP
you mean the system itself?
12the DS passed the PS2 in sells last year
You mean the DS in all of its incarnations, or an individual type?
DS, DS lite, 3DS, etc
you mentioned the advanced didnt look as good as the color
12just DS, DS Lite and DSi
oh
123DS is a entirely different consol
Still, I count those as different consolse, like I count, gameboy, gameboy colour, gameboy advance, and gameboy advance SP as different consoles.
12console*
consoles*
12those are
12but, they all played different games
12and the DS can't play 3DS game
12games*
12where as, the DSi and DS Lite played the same games
Gameboy and gameboy colour game cartridges were the same
12yes, but the Gameboy couldn't play gameboy colour games
Have you ever played them on a Super Gameboy?
I thought it really looked awesome when I tried playing them on the tv
12same
12also, the PS2 had a few incarnations
12Slim and regular
Finding a PS2 in an original box has been a challenge >.>
12really? You can still buy them brand new XD
Wiki still lists PS2 as best selling, above DS.
Though only by 2.5m
12that got outdated a few months ago
Is that old then?
12ah, see
12http://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-2-Console-Slim-Black/dp/B000TLU67W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1333948486&sr=8-1
12you can still buy it brand new
you cant buy an original PS2 brand new
unless you wanna pay a lot for it
that one is the slim version
12you would want the slim one though
why?
12the old one is huge XD
true
but I like the tray
The old PS2 which I have is smaller than my slim PS3
vs the top loader
So, not that big
the PS3 slim is really stripped down compared to the actual PS3 from 2006
12well, it's big compared to the slim
I think PS2 is actually still beating the DS
That's as of January?
Was it really recent that the DS took over?
12I think so
Hmm
12Ohh, that’s combined with 3DS sells. So that claim wouldn’t be legit
12it's still close though, even without 3DS sells
Ah, yeah.
Still, PS2 gets to keeps its top spot for a little longer
12yeah
I could never stick with the PS2
12I could never stick with just one brand XD
Think the only series I really got hooked on was sly cooper
12I play both PS and Nintendo stuff
Well, I do have other consoles, but I do love my PS2
12same
Atari still rocks :)
12PS2, DS, 3DS and PS3 are my favs
12and wii
I have a PS2, PS3, and Wii, for non-handheld consoles.
PS1 is probably still around somewhere. XD
12as for older ones, N64, GBC and PS1 were my favs XD
those are all the consoles you have?
12and Gamegear
12nope
12GameGear was awesome
I never had N64, GBC, SNES/NES. :<
awww
Theres a bunch of consoles I wanna own
12N64 was awesome, however you can download the best N64 games on the wii
Ive been wanting to get my hands on a sega master system
12if you do, get all the Zelda N64 games
12those were awesome
The virtual console feature on the wii is nice and all but what happens when it becomes outdated?
I prefer cartridges
12it can't really
What I mean is, you are rebuying a game
unless you havent played it before
12yeah, but then you don't have to worry about the N64 remote breaking XD
?
12Controller*
I only had one break on me but that was because it wasnt an official controller
12Since you can use the classic wii controller
12my parents never got official ones :/
I think the only Zelda game I've played is TP, which was good, but people always seem to talk most favourably about the older games, OOT, Wind Waker, Majora's Mask.
12Skyward sword, TP and Majora's Mask are my favs
I'm probably old fashion *shrugs*
The gameplay just feels so much better when you play it on the actual console
^
original console that is..
Which is why I love playing pokemon blue/silver on a gameboy colour.
It feels so good.
yeah!
12true, but I ended up with a bunch of un-official N64 controllers
you can still buy em
12which is a pain XD
12true
just try looking in 2nd hand stores
I gotta go
12see ya
see you two laters
Hm
Well, just me, you, and SkylanderDrobot.
12yep
:P
12LOL
Did you come to the IRC first then, or the forums, in terms of SF?
I'd guess the IRC?
12yep
12found this channel on mibbit search
Ahh
12really?
12didn't know he was a fan
Yeah, he was the one who introduced me to TST.
12you should visit more
12well, pony fans tend to also be spyro fans XD
Hah, would seem so. XD
12it almost never fails. I always find out someone's also a spyro fan when their a pony fan. lmao
Heheh, funny thing is the reason I started watching MLP is because friends from SF told me I should watch it. XD
12same, only it was people at TST XD
12started watching it thinking I wouldn't care for it then I started likeing it .-.
12liking*
Ahh, I had no idea what to expect.
I remember the first ep I watched, I cringed for the intro, and was thinking 'OH GOD NO' when the singing started in the ep.
Now I like the songs, lawl.
It grew on me I suppose
12LOL same
Hah
They brainwash you the more you watch. :P
12indeed
I also had bried moment of 'Why the hell am I watching this?' when I realised the intro didn't sound all so terrible to me any more. XP
brief*
12some people were smart and didn't watch in long enough for that to happen :<
Hah, yeah, lucky escape. XD
You tell anyone IRL that you watch it?
12it*
12yep, but only when I find out they do too
Ahh, I haven't told any friends, only family.
12so far I've only told one XD
12and my family knows
12but that's their falt :X
:o?
12fault*
12wanting to know what I watch XD
Ahh
12something people should never ask me XD
Heh.
How'd they react to it? XD
12well, they were just like "... OK"
12lmao
Hahahaha
My family were alright with it, and my dad saw it as a perfect opportunity to crack some 'My Little Porny' jokes. :P
I had my revenge anyway, heh.
12XD
You have any pony merch?
12nope
Ah, I've just got a blind bag Twilight.
12nice
Took it with me when we went to climb some the highest peaks in the UK - got some weird looks when I was taking photos with it on the top. :P
12LOL nice XD
Got some pretty good pictures though.
Nice views up there.
12indeed
12I don't think I'

Yeah, I dunno why, but when I see a mountain, I just get this feeling of 'I HAVE TO CONQUER YOU!'.
And it's worth it for the awesome views, and the feeling when you reach the peak.
12true
rawr u
If you have any good peaks near you, you should go try it.
12there's one I should try, but I don't think it's as high as that one XD
┓(ﾟヘﾟ;)┏ﾟ
12there where some good ones in AZ
12(Arizona)
Ah
03http://artoftrolling.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/internet-troll-isnt-that-just-racist.jpg
Yeah, there's a lot of bigger mountains in the US than the biggest in the UK obviously, so you've probably got a better choice than I have. :P
12yeah
Thoguh I've been looking to do the three peaks challenge
though*
12I heard there's some high ones in france
03http://cheezcomixed.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/koma-comic-strip-ohh-bokki-hes-so-cute.png
Yeah, people always talk about Mont Blanc when it comes to French mountains, so that's probably the biggest.
12I think so
The Alps are partly in France too aren't they?

my teacher just said the Internet was invented by the military
I think he's wrong
wow, these kids are so stubborn

and now I wait ~10 mins for my next class
an android of drf
we are doomed
yep
though my next class, no phones allowed :<
:<
so Umbreon
what kind of dumb class would allow phones anyway
why were you tagged in a photo of a dog in the back of a van, LO
*l
because someone wanted to show it to me
so they highlighted it as best as they could by tagging me with it
that's an odd way to show someone a picture
XD
hey didn't know you know?
i'm a werewolf
LO
L
stupid enter key
06and drf is a vampire
06.me runs
no wonder why we can't find pictures of him
also it's not so much that the class allows phones, but it doesn't actively ban them
hmm
i learned one thing today
drf is nosey
:D
*nosy
/me runs
and more curious than nosy, :P

I would have to fire myself out of a cannon if that were true :<

Mhhm
Doesnt track nicks
Xanbreon: I've been kicked every now and then for swearing, but apparently I never swore.
!swearstats Lakorv
Lakorv hasn't said any badwords...yet. Well done!
Hurhm
L[a]korv, probs under a diff nick
well Lakorv
and we restored an old backup
that might be why
ah, that might explain
not that I'm complaining. *goes back to testing his new IRC-bot code*
Where in the name of frack is my pen
>__<
over there
U SO SMARTARSE
:P
I am :D
/me drinks grape(!) soda
(!)
holy CRAP that app drains battery o.o
and now my phone is fairly hoy
t
f'ing CPU intensive games
O-o
the game is called Tangram X
it made the phone heat up quite a bit and I lose about 20% battery life in 10 mins
probs just really badly coded
:D
yep, another 10%
drain
I even ran ATK and killed all but IRC
:/
btw
mhhm?
http://www.imgur.com/YG5tM.jpg <- ever had this happen with adw?
where the dots don't rotate back
seems to happen to me all the time :/
Think its a common problem
http://www.imgur.com/YG5tM.jpg
er
I dont get why you like those dots so much
well
look at the middle things too
You can get a slider above the dock, or even dots at the top of the screen
And 5 item dock > 3 items
http://www.imgur.com/YG5tM.jpg
...
You have pasted the same link 3 times now
;P
god dang hold on
;)
http://www.imgur.com/MDeGT.jpg
there
that's what it should look like
see the 3 dock icons?
Mhhm
those get screwed too :/
basic ADW is kinda buggy
does ex have that problem?
Nope
The dots are gone though
but the dock doesn't screw itself?
Pretty sure it doesnt
hm
can I get it to look more 'flat' and not like a bookshelf?
The dock? sure, just swap the background or turn it off in the theme settings
I couldn't figure out how o.o
Theres a frackton of dock themes
well
Tis in themes
O-o
if I could get ex to look like the free one...
Sure, apart from the dots
why can't I get the dots :(
Because they where removed
As almost everyone hated them
gaaaaay
well
you could turn them off
NOU
>_>
moar features moar bugs
can I get some sort of buttons down there to switch screens without swiping?
that's why I like the dots, just tap to switch :P
Let me see
Gotta install adw again >_>
what you using now? o.o
trebuchet
as its a ICS launcher
is that be..oh
ICS only?
Yes
ah
It has the ICS style widget selector and app draw etc
yeah, it comes with CM9, right?
Mhhm
I tried apex and nova
They had more options, that I wouldnt use
but meh, I hated CM9 ICS, it was buggy as frick and the GUI looked 'dumber'
And didnt have the same "smooth" feel
O-o
more iPad like and less power user
buggy will be due to early stages of bringup etc
well that and LOL droid 2
Im not sure how you are getting more ipad like, its more HC
haven't tried any custom ROMs on here
I hate HC GUI.
brb
adw ex settings > theme pref > click chose under main dock > custom > adw docks catalog
Knock yourself out
tbh you get more poweruser stuff with ICS
O-o
Im also not sure what theres not to lick
*like
better task switcher, swipe to remove notifications
data usage monitor
etcetc
O_o
back
chew chew chew
hi
:)
I'm in class etc
boooooored
ah
youderp
okieee
as LOL ANCIENT MYTHOLOGY
meep!
that sounds really interesting
well
*envy*
XD
is a good teacher
as in
ah
"this story has lots of sex and violence, you guys will like it"
XD
but our actual teacher, from what I've heard, :/
ah
bah 15% battery life
plug it
I'm in class
LOL
I blame that stupid Tangram game for killing the battery
haha
mee
meep*
sup
/me just sucked again at Draw Something XD
Fracking tumblr
;__;
did you test adw ex yet?
For what?
the screen change buttons
The dock thing?
Oh forgot about that bit
2s
I know you can have dots at the top of the screen
yeah
those are just indicators though
Ah they are as well
Doesnt seem to be anything todo that
O-o
You dislike swiping? O-o
that's what I thought :/
yes
just tapping the corners is easier and faster
Unno, I found it annoying and a waste of screen space :P
I only need 3 dock things
I intentionally keep it at 3 :/
phone > sms > app draw > contacts > chrome beta
urgh, 10% batt
and well
contacts is part of the phone app
so I just have phone, drawer, browser
text I keep on the main screen, habits
ICS, people app ;)
And even when they where combined in GB
I always had two icons
I used to
replaced contacts with firefox

What did it get removed for?
no idea
its not like tney tell you
*they
http://www.imgur.com/49MJw.jpg <- left screen
I showed the center
No clue why it was removed
But ebuddy's push notifications work, unlike a lot of clients
Well, most of the time
http://www.imgur.com/5vZps.jpg <- right 1
http://www.imgur.com/IBXZC.jpg <- right 2
and less than 5% battery :/
You have a lot of random stuff, and toogles! :P
toogles?
widgets, toggles, right2
ah
I need the toggles
too lazy to shutdown/reboot normally
gogo gadget advanced power menu :D
and eh, I just put the frequently used stuff on the sides, old habits die hard
Mhhm :P
even if you get a "new" toy which is actually pushing 30 years old its natural to play around with it
well
class ends in like 20 mins
hopefully less
:/
...o.O
"press ctrl+alt+delete or use the Windows Security button to log on"
wtf is that?
da button
yeah but what
I've never had any computer do that
oh I have

I just press control+alt+delete
these are touchscreen PCs
with Windows 7 Enterprise
what sort of computer?
Windows XP Professional
I mena
*mean

03well that was fast
/me holds up a box from Western Digitalk

03> I like how they kinda didn't put effort into the recertified
Hmm?
03Look at the labels
03it's not blue so I wasn't even sure if it was a Caviar Blue or black (the better of the two)
03true story, I once RMA'd a caviar Green and they sent back a Black
03I was like sure, OK
Old style labels from before they rebranded everything blue/green/black
03LOL, it's been sitting around that long?
03uh
03it says date 05 MAR 2012
03so no
03they're just lazy
03if you look closely it says Recertified
03above the SATA / 8MB Cache
03it's a special label they use for those apparentyl
Ah
03unlike a year or two ago when they'd send me one that looked like retail
Yeh probs
03some of my caviar greens were replacements that look identical to my store-bought ones
03apparently people would RMA drives and resell them or some crap
03like how I'm selling a video card I got back froM RMA :P
They probs take stuff from like, "broken" external drives where just the case is b0rked
or crap
03XD
03also
Why waste when you can get someone to plug it into a tester and shove a new lable on

03before they had an official title for the clean one
03it was that
03:P
03they didn't change it to "forget you" for a couple months after
06i know
06as i first said
06"Lame rephrase"
03well you were playing the actually dirty version :P
03also EW 128kbps
06just because they dont like to say swears
03go quality wh0re some more
03...this version doesn't say the swear words either, derp
03it's still a clean version
03just a DIFFERENT clean version
06..
06still wimps imo
06xD
03well
03contrary to popular belief, swearing does not in fact make you cool
03:P
06i know
06i dont swear
06i think the idea of rephrasing the song 2 times AND re-editing it is kinda stupid
03well what else would you do
03just not play it on the radio at all?
06like, swearing is a frown, but being a wimp and not taking it is also stupid
03yeah but there are things called laws about what you can and can't say LOL
03it's not a big deal to YOU because your country doesn't speak English natively
03I'm sure swearing in whatever language people speak there is worse than in English
erghleee

03it's magic, right?
03I mean
03bookmark it as like, TST

03>_>
14but I'm lazy :(
03oh no, typing 3 letters
03I honestly don't understand people sometimes./
03I literally just type l in Firefox and hit tab, enter
03since it's recognized.
03I don't even have it bookmarked, why bother?
14xD
03I tend to only bookmark sites I keep as reference and don't visit often, as ones I DO visit often just show up when I type the names
03:P
03like Facebook, my email, etc
14it's the opposite for me xP
14I don't know...I find it easier for some reason
14brb
03also, real pros just edit the icons themselves
03no, don't ask me how, I don't really care to learn how to do it
03but it's possible
06why would you care if viri uses bookmarks or not anyway
06myself I just type a few letters then down + enter because lazy
06|3
03<Espeon> why would you care if viri uses bookmarks or not anyway <- I don't,b ut he was complaining about TST not having a favicon so I was saying it's pointless to even bookmark it in the first place
03and with that, bbl
14back
14x3 I just find the bookmarks toolbar cute
06haha favicons it always confuse me because there's sites I go to that have really similar ones.
06and o.o
14o.o
I have bookmarks in my bookmarks
Folders in folders
Mmm folders
06i used to be lazy enough to have a .bat file that opened all my commonly visited sites

7I should've been doing IT coursework really, but the course is a pile of shit.
03so hm
03apparently Facebook timeline hides that person's email now?
03I swear it used to show the emai8l they used to register for Facebook
03o_O
God I hate coursework.
I hate exams too though.
I just hate work.

7I don't mind exams. I despise coursework. I much prefer exams.
14g2g
14good night
10yeah, as mine is still there
03I think timeline lets you hide it
7Exams are just /over/, you know? coursework drags
10I don't have enough stuff to create a timeline. I dislike the looks of it anyway
03yeah, see my conversation with Arti on her profile
03apparently it'll hide the email by default
03or something
03and yeah I hate timeline
03it looks ugly and I actually really like the "info" pane
As long as it's not English coursework it's probably piss easy though.
03it reduces that to some crappy tiny thing
12Hiding your email from people that found your face book page. Makes sense :D
12facebook*
7oh yeah it's easy. but it's fuckin' long as.
10I figured out how to hide it

10and the days when Uranus was pronounced the dirty way
12lmao
10Seriously, up until like, middle school
03I think it's always been said either way
10is when they said people were saying Uranus wrong
13I still do pronounce Uranus the dirty way
13and probably always will |3
03>sees The Twilight Saga on your profile
03pardon me while I go vomit
12LOL
10You never knew?

10I've read all the books, seen all the movies
10and yes
10I plan to see Breaking Dawn part 3
102*
03Facebook is like, the polite way of shoving your interests down other people's throats
12fan girl D:
10no.
03WHen they first added that
10It's like THG, the story's decent, but >fanbase
03I was like "b*** please"
03and even now I think I only have like two things LOL
12I know
03LOL STORY IS DECENT
03Isn't that the overstatement of the century
10IT IS
/me hides
10The Hunger Games > Twilight however
10Twilight is a fad
03agreed, but replace THG with * and that works
03o/` you're a fad, which means something that we already had, but once you're gone you don't come back o/` </Dr. Dre>
12THG characters were way better though
03apparently my friend thought Katniss was hot
03I disagree
03she's just "eh"
10yeah
03there were no hot girls in that movie, which was totally disappointing :<
/me runs
12XD
10Hurr
10What movie has a hot girl in it then?
03Hot Rod.
03and no that's not some sort of joke, that's the actual title
03also Easy A
03and so on
10Pic or name of person?
03sec
7really?
03http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PG0VmDiAL.jpg
03that girl
Yeah, I remember he turned up one time a while ago, when I hadn't seen him for years.
03though she's like, really old, stupid makeup LOL
12That’s so typical drf :/
03what is
7wow
12Liking the girls in that movie XD
10eh @ pic
10then again I don't find girls appealing
03there's only one, LOL
03well yeah
03Emma Stone is the girl in Easy A
03:P
03anyway
03I don't see movies just because certain people are in them
12she's okay
03unlike girls who just go "OMG LEONARDO DICAPRIO MUST WATCH"
13He be overrated :D
03well, Brad Pitt, Johnny Depp, all of those
03it's typical fangirl behavior, seeing movies just because an actor you like is in them
03I'm sure some guys do that but it's not as typical XD
12Johnny Depp is overrated
03agreed
12although he is a good actor, but still overratted
03basically
03anything good is overrated
0399% of the time
03:P
12true
12so I'm overratted? :D
03rather, anything good and popular
12overrated*
12can I test my rain dance team on someone on PO? derp
03oh nice
03I can type in Facebook emails for Draw Something and it actually works

10Tell me about it
03yep
03he was like
/me runs
12Sandwich*
03"Words don't actually mean anything most of the time, you just associate them with things. Like, the Japanese just start making up words for anime titles. There was this one, well I forget the title, but I think in Japanese it literally meant "undead [something something]" and not only is it about girls with guns but it's about ZOMBIE girls with guns. Fun was had by all"
03or something like that
03XD
12that sounds like Puella Magi XD
10wat
03I actually want to watch that show, when it's fully dubbed
03stupid 4 episode sets costing over $100 >_>
10DRF wants to watch Puella Magi?
03yes
13streaming online ftw
03dubs or gtfo
12^
03but junh was telling me there are only 4 episodes out
10Why
10do I feel
10super excited about this
03LOL
03but
10Also, what caught your interest? :P
03it'll be a few months
03the third dub set is slated to come out like the end of june
03uh
03when someone told me it was only 12 episodeds
03-d
10inb4 me
10oh
03I've always wanted to watch more anime
03but the ones people recommend
03are stupidly long
03and I'm not going to just waste weeks at a time watching shows LOL
03but 12 episodes? I can do that in a day
03easily
03if there are any other SHORT anime series that are good... LOL
/me dies
12Code geass is pretty short
03that show sounds awesome
03but
03it's not fully dubbed yet
03is it?
10uh
10I think it is
03is it?
12it is
03I know they were dubbing it
03oh, the whole thing is done?
03nice
10Prepare for tons of innuendos though
03I actually had an interest in that one when it was out in Japan
03because >perverted
/me runs
10Of course :P
03I mean
12LOL
03I watch everything with closed captions
03but that's because I can just read it if I mishear
03instead of "WAIT WHAT WAS THAT, GOTTA REWIND" 20 times
12another good short one is Wolf's Rain
03never even heard of it o.o
10You know, the first 4 episodes of Puella dub -are- online
03see
03I liked Bleach
03but that show goes on forever
03well
03why watch 1/3 of the show only to have to wait?
03I'd rather just wait
03LOL
13Ew Bleach
13it belongs in the toilet
13:3
12Wolfs rain had fillers
03Bleach was actually pretty good
03but I only saw ~30 episodes
03as at the time, there were only 8 dub DVDs
10If you buy it on DVD and it turns out you don't enjoy it
12and cheza was annoying
03each having 3-4 episodes
10Send it over to me
/me dies
03XD
03>buying
12but the last two episodes were good
10well
03once Asian DVD Club comes back
10Amazon is selling it
03I'm sure someone will upload the ISOs
03I know
10for like $80
03for stupidly high amounts of money
10>rip off
12oh gosh cheza XD
03eaxctly
03sdk
03er
03Skylands
03the company that released that
03is known for that sort of thing
10Aniplex
12I hated her
03apparently some of their shows are only available in like $400 sets
03not sure why LOL
12Kiba and Cheza got annoying
12Kiba got annoying when he became obsessed with cheza
12Kiba was fine, but Cheza needed to GTFO
12LOL
12Kiba was good in the first episodes
12yeah
13I wanted moar wolf-forms in the anime -w-
13also LOL I still haven't finished watching that
13> ep 25
12wait really?
12watch the last bits
12they're like, the best episodes LOL
13I don't even remember what's happened D:

03http://chzautocowrecks.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/mobile-phone-texting-autocorrect-parental-feedback-report.jpg

03:P
12want to know which anime is the shortest?
03well I'm not judging only by length
03I just don't want to watch some obnoxiously long series
12Pokemon. It only has 700 Episodes
12:3
03that's like the one show I actually saw :p
03and I stopped after season 8
03which is farther than most people got
12but there's still 8 more to go D:
12and I know what mean
12what you mean*
12Card captors was good, but it has like 80 episodes
10I watched up to the first several episodes of DP
03I watched the first few of Battle Fronteir
03couldn't stand the new voices

6how many letters
10How many letters?
03uh
03let me let the thing reload

12ONLY HAD TO FEATURE UNOWN
12Unown <3

10DRF, is that a no smoking symbol?
03one doe snot simply stop watching anime
/me hides
03uh
03I don't think so
12that would apply to Skylands
/me runs
10I don't get it
10Zig zag
10wait
03mine? Yeah
03I suck at art, OK?
/me hides
10Answer was zig zag
10also no
10I just
10happen to have alot of time over spring break
12anime noms time
/me hides
10except after finishing Shana a second time, I'm losing interest in watching anime all together
10I need to find something new
6nichijou
03OK so
03http://i.imgur.com/J1JX7.jpg
03That was like
03the most creative drawing ever
/me runs
03at least when *I* had Shrek, I drew a happyface with green ears and wrote "animated movie" above it
12drf art D:
03no
03read what it says
6lol
03I was guessing their drawing
03:P
03that same person
6my friends and I
6get way too into this
03gave me a COMPLETELY BLANK SCREEN
12oh
6and also completely out of it
03the word was "white"
DRF liek magical gurls
lol
03so for the next one, I wrote "LOL I see what you did there" then made a new page with the proper drawing
03also gah
03I can't seem to get screenshots to work in Draw Something anymore
03since it involves holding the search button and that app hijacks it
03still trying to screenshot this drawing
6how do you take screenshots on an android?
03you need root
6or is that phone specifc
6oh
03it's both
03some phones have it built in
03mine doesn't
03so I have an app
03you just long-press search
03but in stuff like Android IRC that uses the search key for other things, it gets annoying LOL
03so I have to long-press search then really quickly jump back to the app
12there's even hyper cams for android
6um
6kick one of them
03can I kick both
/me hides
XD
6preferably the longer name
6oh ok
kick all
of nthem
aww
;<
yay the other one quit
10wait
which was me. )
10there's an app for screenshot?
6yeah we know
03yes
03iof you have root
03*if
DURR
:p
03there's a few apps
10Well
10>root
10:I
03I used to use one called ShootMe
03but that requires you to shake the phone
03this one that Xanbreon helped me find
I tried to root Sky's droid
03is called drocap2
10better than nothing
03I actually knew about that app before
03but didn't know you could map it to search
03so yeah
03you long-press search and it just takes a screenshot with drocap
03my Droid 2 had it built in
03some phones have it built in so you don't need root
10aScreenshot
10Just found that in the market
03that one sucks
03it didn't even work for my phone LOL
10Why?
03like it gave me complete green rectangles
03instead of screenshots
03so LOL
/me checks reviews
12phones should just have a Prt Scrn button
/me runs
03I wish
03Android screenshots are actually really complicated
03it basically has to clear the screen then re-draw everything on it
03only it draws it to a png instead of the screen
03or something
03not sure why, it's a bit obnoxious
Due to the security system
03that's still retarded
Normal apps cant touch eachother
Well DRF
12I just go on paint and redraw everything myself instead
03yeah but if fricking iPhones can have it built in
03so can Android
/me runs
ICS has it built in
We're looking at a Linix kernel here, so of course it is going to be more retarded
:D
03does it?
03or is that just because you're using CM9
/me hides
03because CyanogenMod period has it built in
03:P
Yeh, cos the kernel totally has everything todo with the userland
03CM7 has it built in on my Droid 2
03HML
03you can use the printscreen button on Linux
03:P
Yes its built into ICS
Not just CM9
03seen any Motorolas with ICS yet?
03because IIRC
03the only ones that have ICS already
No clue
03are the brands that have built in screenshot regardless
03right?
Its built into the OS
03:P
Its built into AOSP
Srsly
03OK finally I got this to work
03http://i.imgur.com/Ju1wd.jpg
03any ideas?
BUDEW
;<

No clye

03nvm then
13LOL
10Say it
10before
10I go to Urband Dictionary
03XXX is a common abbreviation for porn
03I'm surprised you didn't know that
10I don
10't watch porn
10Simple
03yeah but I'm surprised you hadn't heard the term o.o
Well Sky

/me flees
when I think of XXX, I think of old cartoons where it was written on hillbilly booze bottles
10You're more interesti- I mean floof
6ok even I knew what XXX meant
03that's what I mean
03and apparently
6both definitions of it
03the name came from that beer company
03because
03X was a movie rating
03and XX was a brand of beer
03so they were forced to use 3
03LOL
6yep
03anyway Aurora, did you see the screenshot?
6dos equis had it copyrighted
6yeh
03no idea?
6not sure what it is
03darn it
03I mean, I can't even figure out a word from those letters
03let alone the picture
03hmm, I could use one of those scrabble cheating sites
03where you punch in the letters and it makes words for you
03LOL
10guys
10my dad was standing behind me when XXX was being spoken of

03yeah but the fact she put "eww"
03on that
03that's actually elever

03"omgpop" is one of the words
03that it can give you
6but I couldn't think of it

03the word is Yield
03I hope she'll recognize an upside down yellow triangle
03cuz that's the most obvious thing
03or
03is the red and white one more universal

03what's the yellow, then? XD
10Plain yellow?
03yeah
03the yellow with a black outline
10Yellow and black are warning signs

03was like
10pacifier is cleaner
/me flees
03"Haymitch... sorry, don't know what it is"
03why is Haymitch even a valid word in that game

10I was playing my sis

03yes
03I know
03It was an option for me too
03but I can't draw
03it would look horrible :/
10I wanna know if there's other Pokémon
10drf
10I just drew the eyes, nose, mouth, cheeks
10coloured the rest of the screen yellow

BAMBI
Did you tell her that her mother died?
/me trollfaces
10now I'm reminded how much I dislike the taste of Pepsi
/me just had something labelled
10"Pepsi Next" in the fridge
I can't taste the difference
and I don't care
10uh
10I don't like Pepsi OR Coke
12EW Pepsi
12caffine free coca cola or GTFO
EW SODA
03ew cola in general

10I drink Moutain Dew, but even that gets old

10Dr. Pepper is too fizzy
10IMO
03so is your face
03I mean
03hi
10More fizz than there is drink
10Jones soda is amazing though
12I don't like soda that's not fizzy XD
10except nobody really knows of it
10other than my friends and I
03I know what it is
03I used to buy huge stockpiles of Jones
03it was fricking expensive, but worth it
everybody here loves Jones
for some reason
I don't like it
10the price is what drags me away from buying it all the time
I don't like fizzy drinks
03exactly
10Crystal Light lemonade plz
03eh
03I heard that stuff is horrible for you
03compared to real lemondae
03*nade
03like Minute Maid etc
10how?
Crystal Meth Lemonade
/me hides
03just some of the chemicals in it
03in order to make it "light"
10Dunno
03same reason why they say diet pop is worse than regular pop
03no calories, but all the other crap is worse for you
03or osmething
10orange juiceee
03I just don't care, I drink it all XD

IT IS A TRAP

03prolly not, but random join is random
10how did you know
ohmygoodness
she talked
can we trap her now?

03LOL
03hi Feather :P
10hi XD
6FEATHER MY LOVE.
someone exists
wow
04OH MY GOD FEATHER IS HERE
04NOW HOW CAN I TELL YOU AND SKYLANDS APART?
10AURORA MY LOVE
/me disappears
6by looking at the first letter, duh
04But that's time-consuming
6I guess yeah
04also bluh
04training for the E4 is such a pain in Emerald
04There are so few good training areas. Actually, THERE ARE NONE
6lol exactly
6except
04And since there's no Vs. Seeker in Emerald...
04Only that stupid match call system
6level grinding is fairly easy in the end of victory road
6it sucks with wild pokemon, but goes faster than you think
04Not when you're trying to train a SKARMORY
04Golbat> Run
04Aron> Run
04Lairon> Run
6why?
04Graveler> Run
04Hariyama> FIGHT
6it should have dominance over graveler
04Because Skarmory is slow and not very powerful
6and fair well against golbats
04Golbats > Confuse Ray = OHMYGOD JUST ATTACK
6ok well yeh
6in that case, go grind at sky pillar
12Drake, PO now D:
04bah why
12I want to test out my new team :U
04fffffine
12yays
12we'll just use the server we used last time
04ok
04hi bree

Forgotxx
x.x
not on it now
but eh
i'll return to it this weekend
:p
o-O
gotta catch up
if you told me a few weeks ago that i would be obsessively playing on the dream world
i'd call myself crazy
o.o
:<
you need to get higher points
to have a chance at getting the rarer pokemon
urgh
HML
windows 7 is refusing to resize its partition
/me slaps
04Sea
04See
and mint is being a bastard as resizing it
12I need to work on that team :x
at*
04Ferrothorn destroyed your Milotic because you made the mistake of using Dive
04that's a physical move
Weeind
weird
Don't go against Drake
04this Iron Barbs and Rocky Helmet kick in
you'll lose
04That's a compliment :'D
12XD
hmm
6i need to get some teams together for PO
6sometime
I never had problems with resizing partitions
6possibly tonight
:p
04But NS, I swept his team without a single Pokemon gone
silly Drake
04I need to use my Linoone more often though
04Didn't get a chance to use him
12I made quite a few teams last night
eh I lost my team
04I still have the giant broom if you want it NS :x
12derpteam.tp NS?
12I can give it back to you
nah
the one I used
12ah
04The one she used that kept kicking my @$$
to thrash both of you
04Dat Togekiss
hurr
yep
I have one
12I've been trying to make a good rain dance team
even if it does have the Hikari connection *shudders*
04You used a MARILL
12:'D
6dafuq
12butbut I like Marill :<
6its all good lol
04Toxicroak against a Marill
04Toxicroak knows Thunderpunch
04OHKO!
12lmao
Rain Dance teams
I hate them so much
04hey
04Umbreon
04That thing was a pain
i still have it
04HEY AURORA
6yep
04NINTALES WITH CONFUSE RAY, WILL-O-WISP AND DOUBLE TEAM
04IT KICKS @$$
lol
6*snow clock
maybe i'm doing this training thing all wrong
when i can't find a double battle to do
04Why Toxic?
i should be doing singles to polish my skills at prediction
cus' Toxic is good
I should make a spikes team
04Skarmory is a must then
04Aggron with Heavy Metal
6toxic is for the fact I was training a team against 4 teams that had like two water types each
04Then Heavy Slam
7Hrm.
04holy crap Aggron has 180 base Defense
7Yep.
7But one Earth Power/Focus Blast and...
04I know
04but still
/me 6points out that she hates competitive pokemon battling.
04Aurora
04on PO
04we really don't care
04We're just like "lol"
Drake lol
7Drake, have you tried Rock Head Head Smash Aggron?
I'm competitive but I don't really care that much
04Nope
04I've never used Aggron before
04NS
oh god Aggron is normally really easy to kill
04I get my semi-competitiveness from you
7Think of Stone Edge x1.5.
/me 7is semi-competitive, mostly because of real-life tournaments. :P
04heh
04I only went srs because it's the only way to beat NS
04I could beat her for a time but now she destroys me
7Hmm.
7Well, real-life stuff for me.
7Which means imperfect pokemon and stuff.
6I like training pokemon, I like bonding with them
6I use the pokemon I like
6etc
6I'm not overly competitive because the whole system of competitive battling is just crap
04Aurora
04why do you think I use Toxicroak?
6same reason I use zweilous
Why do you think I use Weavile?
04Why do you think I use Linoone?
7Ninetales. :/
04Shut up NS Weavile is badass
6k I'm not attacking people's opinions, good lord
exactly
<3
7Only became competitively viable this generation. XD
7So that's unfortunate. D:
yeah Ninetales sucked
04heh
04Aurora
04Howsabout Flareon?
7Oh, poor Flareon.
6flareon can be legitimately useful
6apparently
7I've hoped for a Flare Blitz tutor. XD
04Yes
04it can
6I'd like to exploit that
7And also be able to teach Terrakion that move. :U
6a lot of effort, but yeah
12okay, got rid of Marill XD
6flareon with flare blitz and rage, ftw
04use soemthing that can exploit the rain
7Rage? X3
04Dry Skin, Swift Swim etc.
12yeah, I'll be using Dry Skin
04Toxicroak is now a water-wall for my team
7Well, no Drizzle + Swift Swim.
04Dry Skin + Thunderpunch
Dry Skin is horrible
7Pfft, NS. :P
12that's why I always have one non-water type in my rain dance teams
7Dry Skin allows Jynx to stand up to Kyogre. XD
12yep
And standard water team opening pokemon is Politoed
not using it
and besides
I like my team as it is
I've beaten legendary teams with it
04I want
7Uber-tier legendaries?
12^
12a Unown team!
6rage can be a fun move
04it is quite possible
6it just sucks as a start
04to sweep a team of legendaries
6one day
6I will exploit that glitch
6and get my flare blitz flareon
04I want an Aron team as well
12flail?
7Aron. :D
7If only if it was usable in Infrared... D:
7(Doesn't work since all pokemon are leveld to 50.
7)
04aww
7leveled*
7Fleebles.
<Drake> I want an Aron team as well
don't even go into that
7There are plenty of counters to it, though. X3
04like Magic Bounce
Most teams don't have counters for it
7You mean Guard?
04w/e
Magic Bounce doesn't counter it...?
Magic Bounce is only for status effects
04that one Alakazam had
04that NS used to stop it one time
7Yep, Magic Guard.
6magic guar
Yeah
6:|
lol Alakazam
7Not too bad with its new ability.
7Still exceptionally frail.
Frailty doesn't particularly matter when you have insane speed and special attack
7But Mold Breaker; Ground, Rock, and Steel-types, status, Knock Off, Trick...
time to put Aurora to slepe again
if you can get it set up properly and attacks don't miss, you're pretty good to go
04>priotity
04Sucker Punch, STAB Extremespeed...
Steel and rock types get killed by Focus Blast
Knock Off, normally the pokemon isn't fast enough to outspeed alakazam
6nooooo
Trick, destroy the psychic pokemon with Shadow Ball
7Well, that's a big 'if', NS.
03http://chzschooloffail.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/homework-class-test-hipster-darwin-strikes-again1.jpg
6oh back in GSC
Every pokemon is situational
6espeon with bite, that was fun
7But some are more situational than others. :P
Unless you're like me and get Dragon Dance +3
04LOL AURORA
indeed
03http://chzschooloffail.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/homework-class-test-and-copying-from-wikipedia-is-called-college.jpg
03>:P
Umbreon with Psychic, that was fun too
6yeh
lol
7ZAP CANNON ESPEON. :P
6LOL I had zap cannon too
6HGSS, replaced bite with shadow ball
6still good to go
04I hated Zap Cannon
04can't hit anything :/
6I had pretty awesome luck with zap cannon
04I loved Thunder's animation in GSC
lmao Zap Cannon
6forgot what it looked like
porygon-z
lock-on
ZAP AWAY
but that wastes a turn
I hate dynamicpunch so much
7Whoo, 60 base damage per turn. X3
every time someone used it
IT KEPT HITTING ME
04XD
even though it has 50% accuracy
7Was it a Machamp?
6what sucks is attract
04GOD
04DAMN
04IT
04ATTRACT
6that move does not have 30% chance of immobility
7O.o
6it's 30% chance of attacking :|
7At least genders can be set to avoid it.
6yeh
04problem:
7I recall someone using Snow Cloak Froslass with Attract and Confuse Ray.
04You can't tell the gender of a pokemon before it's switched
04That's the problem
7?
12okay, another battle Drake? derp
04I hate Sweet Kiss
04bullccrap it has 75% accuracy
04more like 90%
12alright
7Hey, same as Will-o-Wisp.
7What am I annoyed at in battles?
7Oh, yeah, random crits. :P

hopefully not
6chill guys
6seriously.
Huh?
03...I smell smoke
03around here, that's not usually good
03hopefully the place isn't on fire
drffffffffffffffffffff
windows 7 is being a bastard
and not resizing its partition
03that's why
03you clean install
03for the 50th time
03what I do
03is
03parted magic
03make partitions to size
03then install Win7 to the NTFS partition I already made
03:P
I'm using gparted
03yheah same idea
03-
03*-h
03Parted Magic uses gparte
03d
derp
12fuuu-
downloading it atm
I went through 4 CDs yesterday
before I finally made a working copy of mint 12
12I will beat you one of these years Drake >:@
04XD
03LOL CDs
04Toxicroak keeps sweeping you
04You need ice moves or something
03you don't have a flash drive to spare?
12yep XD
03XBoot is like the single most useful thing I've discovered, ever
03it lets you pile ISO upon ISO onto a flash drive
03:P
03the only ones you can't do are Windows installers, ironically.
03but anything else

6that animation ohhhhhhmygoooooood
7I KNOW THAT ONE.
7It's on dA>
7Sorta.
6that is some beautiful animating
6and dance fortress 2 has some amazing 3D animation onfbcg

04cya
12seeya
03Lunch break at 6PM? LOL
12I probably do
04he's using a Rain Dance Team without a Drizzle Politoad
12I probably do*
7Dusclops can hamper it with Will-o-Wisp.
7And is immune to Drain Punch, if Lyon runs that.
04Nope
7Mmm'kay.
04Brick Break, X-Scissor, Thunderpunch and Sucker Punch
7No boosting move?
04No need. I use Toxicroak as a priority-abusing most of the time
7What does X-Scissor hit that Brick Break and Sucker Punch don't? o.o
7Grasses/
7?
12I'm going to take a break from my rain dance team. XD
04Thunderpunch/Brick Break/X-Scissor then Sucker Punch
04pretty much
04since it has a Focus Sash
7Okay.
7And why not Drain Punch over Brick Break?
7Unless you do like breaking screens. :P
04I have had bad experience with Reflect
04But wait
04Garchomp has Brick Break
7Garchomp? X3
04yah
03OK so

04It can't learn Drain Punch
7 4th Gen tutor.
7Or TM.
7Dah.
7Third time I've made that error.
7Twice in real life dialogue. o_o
04XD
7First time, I suppose, in chat.
04It can only learn Drain Punch via Breeding
04apparently
7And 4th gen. TM./
04And then Thunderpunch requires a 4Gen Tutor...
04wait
7Yeep.
04ah well
04Brick Break works
7If this is simulated battle, I don't suppose you can just make that modification.
04meh
04cbf
7Really? :U
04I'll live without it.
7Okay. :P
04It's not all that important
04I just wish
04Toxicroak could learn Close Combat
7Well, there's Cross Chop.
7Strongest it can get.
Cross Chop is pretty good
04>Breeding
04Plus it doesn't have 100 accuracy
04I'd rather not rely on luck
04and the Random Number Gods have never been kind to me
12Okay, I’m going to use a older team I revised now
04yeah well
04challenge NS
04I'm playing Emerald :I
12alright
Drake
12NS :D
it has good enough accuracy
I don't have PO or a team
7Stone Edge, basically. :P
04ohright
04duh
/me facepalms
I might have a team but I haven't downloaded PO and I'm still trying to set up stuff
04Quan I hate Stone Edge
04Like I said
04RNG hates me
12derp
7Yep, but it's a standard.
7And yes, I hate Stone Edge misses, too.
04if I cared about standards I wouldn't even be using Toxicroak
7I suppose.
/me 7does. X.x
04XD
7Because you can actually win something in real life. XD
04Hell, I wouldn't be using Linoone
7My friend won a poster--that 'pokermon' image.
04XD
OH DRAKE
7So yeah. :P
THAT REMINDS ME
04?
7Which is why I'm less inclined for lolsome games. :/
I haven't played pokemon in ages
7The physical games?

what the flying
>windows 7
>copy iso to external HDD
"You need administrative privileges to copy files to this drive"
WHAT THE HELL IS YOUR PROBLEM
How about
you just turn off UAC
go to cmd
and do all the ATRIB stuffs
:D
attrib /? yayish
I just did it via cmd
huh?
UAC?
oh
that thing
lol I failed to turn that off
Yes or No prompt
:p
yeah
/me goes to look for it
I think I'm already starting to like XP better
well
uh
where do you disable UAC?
/me too lazy to look
just windows key, type user acc + enter
at the bottom
:p
The control panel's "small view' is sooo helpful
I lol'd
I tried setting the UAC thing to Never Notify
and then it comes up with a pop-up
03yeah
03that's better than Vista
03which made you reboot
"Do you want to allow the following program to make changes to this computer?"
/me lol'd
...
03there's a perfectly good reason for it asking you
You must restart your computer to turn off UAC
/me stabs
03LOL
03it hates you
03no but see
03UAC is basically the same as
03"restrict non-admins from doing this{"
03so on domains, e.g. my school
Yet
You're a friggin admin
screw UAC
03it prevents students from turning off UAC
/me raeg
03see what I mean? :P
just konboot and get the admin pass
then hack the hell out of the school network
konboot?
:C
whatever
I'm restarting anyway
burning gparted
03it's a NETWORK PASSWORD
yeah I know
03so something like ophcrack is useless
I was being sarcastic
not particularly
you bruteforce the network login
03LOL
03good luck with that
If only the LAN room wasn't locked with a digitpad
yeah I know
what you do
you infect the network with a trojan virus
03social engineering.
03oh
then use all of them to bruteforce
as one botnet
???
PROFIT
the best botnet is when Mcaffe is installed
they secretly think it works
:p
lol mcaffee
I have no AV installed on my new computer
I need to get spybot
or just get AVG
AVG is good for the simple things
03meh AVG
and isn't as anal about getting in the way as norton is
03get MBAM
LOLwut
I uninstalled norton
03EW NORTON
03EWWWWWWWWWWWW
exactly
03get MBAM"
:P
03for when she downloads porn
03that turns out to be viruses
"You were once pulled screaming out of a woman's <censored>. I don't know why you're acting so dignified."
Please do not swear. You have said a swear word 12 time(s).
03o.o
/me afks now
what
/me feels cold
Drake
my DET laptop has been online for 4days 18hrs 58mins 32secs
03oh
03for a second
03I thought you were going to ask him to go light your fire
03nvmk
03-k
lolwut
03uh, nvm if you don't get it o.o
So like
LOL
My mother's Vista PC usually stays up for 3 or so weeks sometimes
I swear, even though it's Vista, it is stable :|
After I fixed it BSOD every 10 hours before
yo
7I'm off.
7night all.
7oh, and dari: she's pretty hot too :P
lol oops I think I just formatted windows' pagefile partition
oh well
03oh
03you mean System Reserved?
03http://i.imgur.com/fGxbW.jpg
yeah I think I just deleted it
03you don't actually need that
03but
Good going
03Windows won't boot without it
:D
03but
._.
03you can install it without it
/me sighs
03it's really stupid and the reason I partition before installing
03System Reserved just has some recovery crap if your computer won't boot
03but the disc also has that
03so yeah
I remembered the day
03just use gparted, delete the entire drive
I first did a clean install
03make NTFS partition
03make extw/e for Linux
03then install Windows
03then install Linux so you get the dualboot thing
03profit?
how long
does it take to install windows?
0330 mins
03roughly
More if you have a slow hdd
03yeah
0330-45
03it's much faster than XP though
03well
03mainly because of hte formatting
My laptop
well fine
hmm..
03XP is just as fast I suppose if you preformat
I'll completely reinstall 7
Good jorb NS you derp
that means I need to redo my tweaking
whatever
Took like 2 hours with an OEM disl,
urgh
well
Less than 2 hours
I need to burn windows to a DVD, don't I?
eeeyup.
03or use a flash drive
No copypasta
03flash drive is faster
03if you have a 4+GB one
03that you can wipe
ORLY?!
03yes
I really need a 4GB flash drive then
03installing Windows 7 from a flash drive is like, you can do it in 20 mins XD
03yeah
blah
I have 2 unallocated partitions
03I actually have a designated Win7 Pro x64 flash drive
how2merge?
03sigh
03just
03DELETE EVERYTHING
03and start over
03it's not rocket science
03in fact, just do Create partition table
03:)
fiiiine
But DRF
;_;
She'll loose NORTON!!!
Files
;P
03LOL
03*losew
03-w
03not loose
03loose is an adjective
03:|
as soon as I finish copying the iso to your public_html
03you haven't downloaded it yet? o.o
it's 3GB
03I thought you said you had it o.o
it's STILL COPYING
nope
03why copy
03just move
03o.o
same time though
12derp. been busy with school work all day .-.
03not realy
03moving is instant
orly?
03copying actually creates a copy
03derp
03Yes.
03at least it SHOULd be
oh
03LOL how did you not know that
03moving a file is usually instant
03if it's on the same drive
03it's only when you move between drives that it takes just as long
it's not instant ):
03then ext3 or whatever it is sucks horribly
On all sane file systems it should be
03it's darn near instant on Windows
well it's done now
03exactly
Are you on the forums?
03and by Windows I mean NTFS
03and FAT32, too
Yay Fat32
Fat16 can die
Sloowly
for example on ext3/4 it wont actually move anything, just update where the file is
FAT32 is a PoS
And should die in a fire
03well
03I use it for flash drives still
03as LOL UNIVERSALL COMPATIBLE
fff
03NTFS can cause issues
what is the damn url to your stupid public_html
NTFS is a pretty crappy filesystem
03um
03it's not public_html
03it has to be in var/www
03and you need sudo to move it
-_-
03this
03is why
03I hate linux
oh yeah apache
At least we have decent file restore programs
;-;
Why are you not in the www-data group?
derps
03I have no idea
03I was just setting it up quickly so Sky/HML could download a movie
03LOL
ext have good file recovery programs
03never seen one, never heard of one working o.o
03GetDataBack for NTFS is like the single best thing ever made
03there's a FAT version too
this
is going to take forever
HFS+ best filesystem evah :D
downloading at 1mbps
Then whoever was using the ext recovery program was a derp
Waitasec
if Ext only updates the position of the file instead of moving the data
What happens if the file is in a bad sector and you try to move it to a folder that might have a better sector :o
03LOL
03so
03HML/ Xanbreon
03I noticed the weirdest thing ever
03that's really bugging me
03you know that seagate that broke and had a couple files I needed on it?
Yeaah
:P
Did it break the recovery program?
03Yep
03OK like'
03ever heard of SpinRite?
If the data is on a bad sector, its screwed anyway
03well
03here's the thing
03I tried SpinRite on another broken drive
03it would get to the broken part
03attempt to recover it
03then error
12yep /late
03and go "nope, sorry, can't fix it"
03on this drive
03it literally STOPS
03it just, full stop
Bada** drive :<
03hits about 48% and just stops the stupid thing
03but
03the timer keeps going
03it's supposedly still reading data
Then the drive is totally screwed
03but if you look at the live snapshot of data being read
03it's frozen
03after about a day
03it got another 1% done
03LOL
03but what I dont'get
03is why does it literally stop the programs
well it would be good to have more here
03rather then them go "Uh, can't read this, bad sector!"
I remember when that happened
03same thing happens with scandisk, even the fast one
but I think the harder part is keeping them here
03it'll get to about 48% and just STOP
to an old ATA/IDE maxtor drive
it froze up my windows so badly
03and cancelling the scandisk was what caused me to lose that 20GB TV recording >:@
03now it shows up as a 0 byte file
Might be the heads that are broken
03since scandisk had it "locked"
12true
Maybe you could make a full partition copy trololol
:p
03well
03I might try to run DBAN, but only after I'm 100% sure I can't get my crap back :/
03because right now, SpinRite *is* still going, just very very very very very slowly
03like LOL taking an entire week for one drive
Hm
Sleep time
Night
make sure you have UPS
:p
03nah, I make sure I have FedEx
/me runs
03also eh

I'm off to play KH
so bbl
I remember in 2008 when flatscreen TVs weren't flat.
/me stabs MicroSD cards
03these files are copying at like 8MB/sec
03usually the *read* speeds are really good
Whoa
03and it's the *write* speed that's slow
03yay taking close to an hour >_>
My silly cards usually like
actually
03to copy the contents of my old phone's MicroSD to my computer
/me tests his 4GB class 2
er
CLASS 6.
03OH GOD CLASS 2
03good
03this one's a class 4
03but it's also 32GB
I'm getting like 7.5MB/S write speed using chkflash
not very many options XD
03yeah but
03I'm talking about *read* speed
03not write speed
03read speed is usually much faster
i'm testing that next
03I'm copying actual fiels LOL
03*files
03http://graphjam.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/funny-graphs-probably-the-first-person-to-lose-a-limb-with-one-too.jpg <- if ony
03*only
03I actually asked my physics teacher once if lightsabers are physically possible. True story
03He had these random discussion periods when there was nothing to teach so he let us just have "educated" physics discussions
03best class I ever had in high school IMO
03wait,w hy did I even say IMO, that's implied o_O
7.8 MB/S write
yay silly
03that's
03actually not bad for a class 6
03as technically
03it only needs to be 6MB/sec
but it does like 500kb/S for a ton of small files
03well yeah
03that's true of any medium
But yeah
03even solid states
why does the only pokemon who can learn helping hands
03Windows 7 is a *bit* better at that, but it still has issues
03hence
and possibly survive the attack at the sametime
03why if I have tons of small files
03I just winrar them LOL
not have any dark type moves
Getting an average of 7.4-7.8
so not bad.
to shoe away any ghost types

ooh
16.4 MB/S read speed
decent little thing
03nice
03that's twice as fast as mine's going x.x
go use chkflsh
and test your card
and see how it compares :<
03when I'm done copying craptons of data
03I have like 20GB of stuff to copy

03*that
you need to study your history
that's one of the most notable things ozzy has ever done
he took a bite out of a live bat on stage once
03wait, really?
03just randomly?
it was thown up on stage i think if i heard correctly
ozzy picked it up and took a bite out of it
03how does one throw a live bat
his side of the story was he thought it was a fake bat
03LOL
03and there's no video of this?
but i don't know how you can honestly not tell the two apart
PETA probably erased them all
03LOL
but i don't know how you can honestly not tell the two apart
unless you were super high
and we both know ozzy had that wild side
03XD
03speaking of which
03what other good songs does he have
03besides Crazy Train and Mr. Crowley
03as those are the two I keep hearing
iron man
:P
03uh
03that was by Black Sabbath
ozzy did his own version of the song
btw
ozzy was part of black sabbath
03I actually didn't know that
03also wtf
03so I'm making pizza rolls, right
03the container says

03like literally frozen
lol
03I'm cooking for like two mins now
03>_>

i am not sure if they were made to be microwaved
03they aren't
03but I'm in a dorm
03what else can I do
03besides eat them frozen
sometimes, there are things only an oven can do

03I totally wanted to buy some texas toast
03butr
03-r
03those are oven only
03so I was like :( and put them back

03they don't even allow you to bring a toaster
03let alone an oven

03the sad thing
12derp
03is that my phone gets twice the resolution of my actual camera
12well, resolution and or size isn't everything
03that's what she said
03but yeah, i know.
03but my camera is only 4MP
03which is a bit "crap" by today's standards
Heey
03but I love that camera, new ones are too flimsy
I thaught
though
you had an HD camera
;<
03um
03yes
03that's a video camera
031080p is like 2MP
My camera does 720P

03see

03but then I realized it would make me look like a complete jerk
03XD
Say whayt?
03well
Go to BDA?
:P
03he's on a cruse all week, right
12LOL people who use MP as an excuse to buy a new camera.
03*cruise
12The MPs of a camera have nothing to do with image quality XD
03...I misread that as MLP
03anyway though HML
12see, MPs only matter if you care about the size of the image

12I figured out how to DDOS for fun today. (I didn’t do anything btw) XD
03see
03I don't even know how to DDOS
03I don't *want* to know
03because some people just assume that I'm some pro hacker because I'm good at computers
12I just wanted to know for some reason
03so not knowing how to is the best defense XC
03*XD
Be a genius
12what is this HML
and DDOS 127.0.0.1 and 192.168.1.1 plz

12I'm already a genius >:@

You'll take down the internet
Really!!
12I would be DDOSing myself LOL
But
You'll take down the internet!
:D
12But really, it’s just code that you combine with their IP in command prompt that massive pings the server to death
12Causes it to crash
12Of course, that would take days of DDOSing, and then you would get put in prison XD

Hi
I am back
from internet died
:D
03I was the guy who provided everybody with proxies, right
03well
12derp
03one day I get called down to the office
03they had a fricking cop
03and the principal
12XD
03and the director of IT for the school district
03I could tell it was serious business
ohmy
03they're like
;-;
U gonna get slammed?>
03"SO there's a rumor going around that a group ofp eople hacked everybody's password and had a 'master list' somewhere. Do you know anything about this?"
03I was like um, no
03as I honestly hadn't
03and they were like "well, 4 separate people told us you might know who's responsible"
03I was like "wait, what? 4 peopel gave my name?" "Yep"
03I'm like ...
03Just because I gave them a way to bypass the filter
03does not know I know how tos teal password
03*mean
03-_-
12LOL
03that meeting was so awkward
03I was in there for like an hour
03being questioned
03have you ever done this, this, this
03at one point I told the guy
03"Look, honestly, I'm all talk. I have no idea how to "hack" anything. The worst I've done is just bypass the filter a few time"
03*s
03and he's like "well that's good, you don't want to go that route"
03I was like "oh, I know, I'm ethical"
03it's the same reason I refuse to accept money for my bootleg copies of stuff
03even if it's just repayment or a thank-you donation
If that happened to me
03I don't care, I won't take it
um
03hi
12well, it's actually pretty easy to make a proxy compared to hacker stuff XD
I would just say "I dislike censorship and I prefer to increase my productivity by using my own methods of work!"
hi?
03and I didn't even MAKE the proxy
03I just found the
03m
03ever heard of Peacefire?
12nope
03they usually use two ordinary words
12ah
03like, for example, squirrel tree
03or something
03and just make it .com
03so that way it's not obvious
03cuz, you know, the early proxies (for example, 4proxy.com was the first one I used) were like "um, it has the word proxy in it, ban"
03anyway, the thing is
03you go to one of the peacefire proxies
03there's a form at the bottom to sign up for their mailing list
03that way when they get blocked, you get an email with a new one
03:P
03that's basically all I did LOL
12XD
03OK so
03I didn't finish
03after the cop left
03and it was just me and the IT admin
03he was like "you said you bypassed the proxy? What made you think you had the right to do that?"
03I was like "Because your stupid filtering system blocked everything left and right and I had actual research to do about handguns for a speech and couldn't do it?"
03and he was like "The stuff we blocked is blocked for a reason. You aren't supposed to be doing that at school"
03I'm like "Um, no? It's as if someone just took the master list and blocked them all without actually hand-checking the sites, which is stupid and lots of legitimate sites were blocked that souldn't have been"
03he's like "Well, being that person who's in charge of the proxy, I assure you that's not true"
03I go "Oh really then? Then why is my own personal server with nothing bad on it blocked for porn?"
03dead silence for about a minute
03then he goes "Thanks for talking, you're free to go"
03I was laughing so hard when I got out of there
ouch.
You trolled him good
:D
03Yep
03to this day I have never heard from them again :P
03they were all
03"I know you're graduating soon but we have your contact info if we get more reports that you know anything about this"
03I was like w/e
03nope, never heard from them
03:P
03but yeah, those were the days
03Get this
03Earlier today, Iw as freaking out because my password didn't work, I thought I had been banned or something (from the university PCs)
03then I was like "derp, they forced me to change my password, that's right"
12I hate forced passwork changes XD
03yeah
03but
03I found a way around it
12password*
03it weas like "cannot repeat any of your previous 5 password"
03*s
03OK fine, challenge accepted
03so I change it to
03temp1
03temp2
03temp3
03etc
03then change it back
03:P
12LOL
Good idea
:o
12and I thought I was the only one who did that
We can't change passwords on demand so.
;<
03what I fricking hate
03is what Windows considers secure passwords
03>must be at least 8 characters
03My usual password is 7
03RAGE
12my usual password is 12
03well mine's 7 LOL
03I want to figure out if there's a way to get around the thing
03maybe using a VPN
10 for me
03Since it had that issue before
03HML you might like this
I AM THE MIDDLE PERCENT
03our school is odd
03and has two passwords
03one for Windows only
03the other for the Linux systems, email, the school control panel, etc
12but some sites want your password to be something like: 54%^54g;'{[0-\`~@13fgr54t$%64554
/me runs
03well
03both of them were set to some stupid pasword originally
03Windows is easy to change, it's like 8 characters or more, that's all
03well the other one
03I log into my email
03go to change it
03it's like "You must have: at least one letter, number, and symbol"
03I'm like >:@
Returrded
03well we had a lab class where we used Linux systems
03I go in there
ew.
03do passwd
03and change it
I would hate that class
03to my usual "unsafe" passweord
03-e
12EW symbols in passwords
:<
03it didn't whine
03:P
03so I now have a gmail password
03that is only 7 chars long
03umad?
03gmail requires 8+
03but I'm special
127? All my passwords are even numbers XD
12like 6, 10 and 12
03it's 7.
03Don't ask why
03I've had that password since second grade
03and I'll be d***ed if some stupid new rules are going to make me change it
03:P
12XD
12I've had mine since 4th grade
/me hides
INB4 His password is DanielF
/me dies
I've never had a set password though
Every single school used a different password.
03-_-
03anyway though
03the reason I was able to get away with it
12HML, what's your password? :D
03is that the school migrated to gmail after I had already set the password on their Java email system
03and it just copied the apsswords over
03:P
12my password is derpherphurr
/me hides
I keep a text file of all my passwords
Or should I say
My previous passwords
12I bet if it was something suggestive no one would be able to guess :D
/me runs
we change them ever 4 months :|
12unless it's a new password, I never write mine down
12and that's only if it's a password to server,etc
03yeah exactly
03I try to use my same password everywhere
03I know that's supposedly unsafe
03but it's not like anybody actually nkows it
03*kjnows
03-j
12and it's also not like anyone knows everywhere you've been XD
03well
03on any site it's registered
03:P
03except AIM for some reason.
03AIM wouldn't let me use that name
;o
12like, if someone got your ebay password, how would they know you're a member on TST,etc
maybe you afren't the deal DRF
:|
03um
03by just using that username derp
03as in
03I could just figure it out
03LOL
12true XD
12cookie dough ice cream <3

03The AMD Mobility Radeon graphics driver supplied by the notebook manufacturer is customized for the built-in display and the features and functions specific to the notebook. It is recommended to use the drivers provided by the notebook manufacturer.
I need that key by the way
03yeah, that's what I *said*
03and you have a whole 30 days before you need the key
03:P
03but I'll PM it to you
03so you can enter it duruing setup
03*during
well
/me reboots the computer
also gparted hates the touchpad on this thing lol
so do I but derp
03I PM'ed you the key
03it prolly won't activate, but just prod me about that somtime as you have a whole 30 days
alright
03what model laptop is it again?

bleh
I still need to create a pagefile blah partition
fml
03Windows doesn't need that :P
and then I need to create /home /boot etc. for linux
03but if you mean for swap space
03then yeah
03LOL LINUX
Well it's linux mint
which requires deleting everything to upgrade
03I still think you should just virtualize it
03...
03that's retarded
retarded Linux FT
FTL
well mint is retarded in that
03I managed to do ubnutu fine
03*ubuntu
ubuntu != mint
03I know
it's some dodgy crap
03Ubuntu used to be good
03not anymore
03:P
so I'm going to put /home on a diff partition
so it doesn't require a lolwipe
03you can't just point it to an ext3 partition? o.o
yeah
bleh
03have you TRIED running Linux in MWare?
03*VMWare
03as I swear
03it should run FINE on that system
Yes
It lags
03...
And for your information
03did you give it really crappy specs?
linux is my main operating system
03give it like 2 gigs of RAM
not windows
03I know, hence why I'm whining about you being so stubborn
I'd rather run windows in a VM on linux
which I could do
03that's even more laggy
so? it's not like I use windows
Run win2
win2k
03LOL
hah
that's fast
;d
03>not like you use Windows
03>want to play games
03LOL
drf
03just accept that you can't live without it
I didn't boot into windows for at least 3 months
We have a contradiction over here?
03I'm not trying to turn you into some microsoft fan
I rarely play games
03I just hate people going "Pssh, I'm some hardcore haxor, f*** Windows"
03because seriously
lol I don't hate windows
03it's so much more trouble than it's worth to get Linux actually working on hardware
well once it works it's pretty good
03and Windows isn't?
and linux is far better for servers than windows is
03my laptop basically never crashes
03yeah but
I didn't say that
03why would you use your laptop as a server
03I don't deny that Linux servers are good
03but I'm talking about home use
03even on a desktop, sure
03but Linux on laptops - blech
03*=
lol
03I mean, don't get me wrong
~$ uptime
23:48:11 up 248 days, 23:51
03Ubuntu supported all my hardware
03but it just sucked
03like
that's a linux home server running on a netbook
248 days, better than a lot of VPSes
03even though I had a 2.4GHz CXPU
Does it ever move around
03*CPU
nope HML
03It would be running at 800MHz
03and CPU scaling is one thing
it's for a server
03but it would *always* run at 800MHz
~$ free -m
total used free shared buffers cached

Swap: 1953 146 1807
03I'd go to boot VMWare, it would take 25 mins to boot WIndows XP and then just crash the stupid computer
03and it was a Core 2 Duo, not like some proprietary crap...
model name : Intel(R) Atom(TM) CPU N270 @ 1.60GHz
03so I just said screw dualbooting
>VMware
OH NO
lrn2virtualbox
Atom
LOL
I use both
yeah atoms suck
U mad?
03having a VM of XP
03with 1GB of RAM
03should NOT take more than 2 mins to boot
03LOL
derp
well
03this thing took at least 5 before completely freezing my computer
03I'm not even exaggerating -_-
let me finish making my partition table
I think I'll allocate 130GB to windows and the rest to linux
03how big is the drive?
640GB
Speaking of
nice.
03LOL
I want 640GB
03I gave my Linux like 50GB
613GB after taking account all the random computer crap
03and gave the rest to Windows
;-;
03:P
03it's not "random computer crap"
well windows is your main OS
linux is mine
03it's called scientific GB vs technical GB
03:P
yeah true
03or as some people call them, salesman's GB

03yeah w/e
well
03I have 500GB in my laptop
03I was gonna get a 1TB
03but I missed the sale
/me makes a partition
03and I don't really use my laptop that much
do I seriously need another partition for swap space? -_-
I really can't be bothered to configure this
lmao
03aloso
03*also
03yes
daaaaaaaaaaamnit
you can probably disable swap
03for Linux you need a swap partition
who needs it
Oooh

linux yeah
03it has to be the same size as your RAM
I was talking about windows
03so in otherwords, 8GB
Do want that
:c
Haha
My swap wil only be 3GB/4
03HML
and obviously there's that random recovery crap
03that's stupid, that's only 750GB
03you want a 1TB :P
03dude
03Newegg
03had a 1TB laptop drive
03on sale for $100
recovery hogs 20GB or something
03I was gonna buy one but I missed it
03wait, what?
03it shouldn't o_O
03all you need is the ext3 + swap
well the default install did
but it has 16MB of cache :<
03or ext4 or whatever you kids use these days
noooo for windows
03...
03um
03you only need one NTFS partition
03OH
fiiiine
o-o
03That's because
03that recovery crap
03is HP's crap
03delete it
oh
03yeah I hate those
Already did
03they're like
new partition table remember?
03yeah
03they're like
03"we don't want to give you a Windows disc because LOLpiracy so instead we're just going to steal 10% of your hard drive space by putting the contents on there :D"
I was like "why the f*ck are you eating my hard disk space with your useless crap"
lmao
03I'm not even kiding.
03*kidding
XD
03when my sister got her Dell
03I literally
03within 20 mins of her opening it
03wiped it
03installed my own Win7
03then called Dell
03and screamed at them until they agreed to send me *DVDs*
LOL
lmao
Did it work?
03no actually
03they never sent the DVDs
03but I don't really care
03all the drivers were at support.dell.com
Ah
03and I have enough Windows discs to sink a ship

03it's drive S
03like 1/3 filled already
2/4
03just with XP/Vista/7 ISOs and various Office suites etc
;D
03well, my laptop backup is prolly eating some of that
urgh
03but yeah
I can make the swap an extended partition instead of a primary partition
03um
not sure if that's going to murder it
03I have no idea.
w/e
03I love how you don't actually know how Linux formatting works :P
I know how it works
03like, I don't even USE the stupid OS and I know more about it LOL
it's just been ages since I last partitioned something
03you mean you don't carry a Parted Magic flash drive with you and just wipe random people's computers for fun and profit? :(
03...not like I do or anything *cough*
lmao
03nah I don't wiope them
03-o
03but I do carry that around
03it's my xboot drive
Ah
03has a bunch of different tools and utilities
03I want to buy an engraved one
03I've got two parted magics, gparted live, DBAN, some recovery programs, Symantec Ghost, various other things
heh
oh f
swap drive should be 8192 or something, not 8000
stupid systems
03um
03yes
03I could have told you that LOL
shut up, I totally wasn't failing
03suuure
):
I want
a

64GB swap file
:D
there's a FS called extfat?
extra fat or something?
lol
!own
wtf is the point of an extfat system
;o
that's mysticlugia's script
!attack Umbreon

oh
What is the point of ext500000000
Spamming version numbers :<
12sorry, been idle. lol
12yep
what is the point of /dev/null?
it's a message sink
anything that goes in there is nulled literally
Why can't they just direct it to *just* NUL
:p
03I WANT TO BE THE BEST THE VERY BEST
But no, gotta make an entire folder/directory for nul
;-;
do you know if they can be shared?
or do the adventure packs only work with your console afterwards?
wb btw :)
hm
heh drf
03?
I've made my 3 partitions
/me plugs windows DVD in
03would you like a metal?
03wait, it actually finished?
03and uh, medal
03not metal
fail
/me hands you some steel anyway
/me slaps drf with a metal
partitioning took like
10 seconds
fast
:P
I'm using gparted
anyway
need to reboot the thing
I'm wondering if I should make my windows partition bigger
shouldn't need to though
each game only takes up around 20GB max
so it should be adequate
for some reason the first install was eating 60GB of disk space
wtf
is that just HP's crap
o-o
or windows?
WINDOWS Y U TAKE SO LONG TO BOOT FROM CD
03because it loads the entire bootloader
yeah well so does everything else that boots from CD
installing atm
or expanding windows files, as the installer calls it
don't break grub
it's not fun
tell me about it
I did it once
was like OFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-

03oh, it's not finding any?
03ah
yeah
03right click computer
03and click manage
I know how to connect to networks
03see what has a red X
03those are the drivers it's msising
03*missing
ah
03Oh god
03proset
03or ralink?
03ugh which is it

o-o?
huh?
03well
03basically
how about I connect it
03HP's site
and let you VNC?
03is as stupidly vague as anything else
03yeah sure
03but first
let me find my LAN cable
03we need to figure out whi...that works too
03there's no red X over the ethernet?
which is where?
there's the triangle yellow thing
03I thought I said that
03yeah
03over which things
03then the Ethernet prolly needs drivers too
SM Bus Controll
USB Controller
urgh
03this
03is why
03I hate brand name computers
03they use stupidly proprietary crap
let me find
03for everything
im bak
my ethernet cable
wb
03my MSI laptop, I just install Windows and literally everything works
im not good with all the techie stuff
03except for like one card reader
so yeah
wtf...
windows
so
it makes things happen
where the hell is the plug?
03dunno, look? LOL
what i was about to say....
so no onw here is from alaska?

on this one? yes
wtf
03OKJ
silly state D:
03*OK
I plug in the lan cable
it's too big
03you need drivers
03for the LAN
it's not connected still
oh yeah
fml
03anyway
03http://ftp.hp.com/pub/softpaq/sp55001-55500/sp55105.exe
03download that

I have another computer as well
03don't run it
03extract it
...it's an exe
03just trust me
how is she going to execute it
linux doesn't know .exe files
03it's a self extracting archie.
XD
03*archive
03hence winrar
03:P
03basically
uh
03HP-packaged drivers
03install HP Crap
03so
03extract it
oh
03:P
03it's the pro way of doing it
how about
I just copypaste it over to the other copmuter
which I don't even know if it has USB ports
working
03prolly USB3.0
03if it has them
http://i.imgur.com/TXBNC.jpg
03LOL what is that
not sure
XD
yeah it's not reading the USB
03um
03try the other ports
03I'm sure at least one is a 2.0
03and not a 3.0
nope none working
03OMG
CD might
wow
03yeah
03that should
03I seriously
03hate HP
03so much
need to burn it on the other comp
My windows 7 OEM disk
03Yeah sure
so brb
did everything
03extract it first though
03if you can
except Wifi
03exactly
03mine does everything except the video card (duh) and the card reader
03and the CIR thing
03which is for infrared remotes
03because trololol controlling yoru laptop with a remote
03*your

government in generals are stupid
democracy is an illusion
10Likewise, there is no such thing as a perfect form of governance
1212there's always better/worse though
1212The US government will put someone in prison for life for piracy, and yet they’ll give someone just a few years for murder
02oh, you mean the incident with the owner of megaupload right?
1212yep, and other stuff like that
02oh yeah <.<
02he freakingly got 50 years for piracy, while a murderer got 20 years
1212Once they gave a housewife the same penalty as him for downloading a few songs LOL
02what?
It is stupid
1212yep.
this is why Sweden <3
1212they charged her $150,000 for every song she downloaded
02sweden batman = Läderlappen x3
...lol
150000?
that's retarded
1212that's the fine here :D
02what? 150k? how many did she downloaded?
121220
02.....
023 million?
1212almost, it was like 18 or 19 songs
Sweden isn't really all that <3, but I'd better not get involved in discussing politics.
1212Sweeden is awesome
02i love sweden metalists x3
1212for other reasons too
02and i have a schoolmate who actually is swedish
1212like, you can move there and they won't try to stop you :D
Lakorv, politics are stupid by default

openssl is being a stupid bastard
I don't want openssl1.0.0, I want openssl0.9.8
and I can't revert
without uninstalling something like 50 packages
which I /don't/ want to do
Whats wrong with openssl 1?
Xanbreon, won't work with sshpass
and openssl lacks support for a lot of programs
openssl 1*
now
O-o
how the hell do I uninstall openssl 1 and install 0.9.8 without uninstalling about 50 packages?
Never had any problems with 0.9.8
NO YOU BASTARD
You probs cant
I RAN MAKE INSTALL
fml
Good jorb
The following packages will be REMOVED:
apt-transport-https* bluez-cups* brasero* brasero-cdrkit* ca-certificates*

that's a lot
since *s
and woops
sorry for spamming
Well yeh
didn't realise it was all newline
Anything thats compiled against openssl1
always newline.
yeah
that's gonna total around 500 packages
and I need openssl 0.9.8
or at least something that's not 1
/me checks sshpass's syntax
and how about you install 0.9.8 from source in a different location and then build sshpass to use that?
Let's see if I can-
yeah I was thinking about that
and now I'm off, so have fun with your debian-based distro havoc.
debian is good though ):
Arch <3
debian <3
Have you checked is theres a newer version of sshpass
pretty sure this is the newest
Mint <3 </troll>
$ sshpass -V
sshpass 1.04 (C) 2006-2008 Lingnu Open Source Consulting Ltd.
I used Mint 9 for 2 years
only starting to use Mint 12 now
heh
because upgrading mint sucks
Did it get worse?
hm
I think I'm going to have to recompile sshpass
Good luck and have fun
Whyyyyyyy recompiling ;-;
aaaand it's still extracting
I should get a Pentium 1 system
because HML
and recompile everything
workarounds
HML
try get gentoo and do it
:{D
>emerge
/me cringes
seriously
Workarounds for what? :<
updating gentoo literally takes DAYS
oh wow :c
Soo
I'm serious
Some programs are compile only?
huh?
Well
I mean, source only, nothing is precompiled?
blah, brbs
finally
$ ./openssl version
OpenSSL 0.9.8u 12 Mar 2012
now
let's get sshpass working
=P
$ sshpass -V
bash: /usr/bin/sshpass: No such file or directory
y u so silly
oh it's /usr/local/in
wtf
bin*
mhhm
okay wtf
why is it STILL not working
I know it's not an issue with my bash script
because it has worked in the past
02bash script?
don't worry
Xanbreon heeeeeelp
Wut
What you b0rked?
idk
So, whats the problem?
sshpass being a PITA
Did it wor?
it's working with sftp
but not ssh
seems to be a sshclient issue
Somebody should seriously make a USSH (Unsecures shell) :D

I'm never going to finish it though
i'll sit here with my heart crushed by microsoft
Why?
:P
because i just got a 66% in a test on the windows 2008 server
!pokemon
if windows wasn't so stupidly complex
it would be easier to ace
at least linux is simple and to the point
it doesn't try to stray around the corner
although i do admit i'm not going to like the test tomorrow in linux class, even though it's open notes and has nothing to do with linux in general
lool
the test in linux class is on chapters 6 9 and 10
which is...
shell scripting
perl
and c and C+

I wish I had time for more anime
I really want to rewatch all of Higurashi
I watch more live action things than anime now.... what have I become?!
┐(￣ー￣)┌
03I don't even watch most anime

That being said, I haven't seen many recent anime being aired that are actually interesting to me
/me shrugs, too occupied watching older animes
Aaah, I want to read that
*watch
Hm
Mom asks me how the studying is going, I said they put so much in one course, it's so much to study
Then she says,
"I can't imagine, that is why I never university!"
03hm
03I thought someone said ti was
03o.o
03*it
10I said I thought it was
03oh
03well apparently it hasn't been released yet
10and last year when I was watching it
03due to some dispute between Funimation and the other company
10A few episodes I could only find in dub
03<bluesun2> this year sometime proly
03<usotsuki> yeah, that's what Wiki says
03<bluesun2> apparently it's one show Manga tried to campaign to release on BD, but the JP licensor said NO BD 4 U
03<usotsuki> well, until Funi releases it, no dub
hey guys

/me throws a bottle of water to Skylands
Aaah, lucky you
10Samurrot, I'll need that
03it doesn't need to be Easter for you to eat chocolate LOL
I had no chocolate, I had to stay on campus and study for easer
Drink up, that should help balance things out a little :P
/me sets up the treadmill while she continues to watch anime
Easter time = special chocolate and more advertising
thus = more people nomming
03and Valentine's Day?
03and Hallowe?
03*en
Easter is bunny candy, and bunny candy is special
03...it's such an oven in my room that the chocolate I have left is melting

/me runs
10yeah
03it's the first half of the show
03I'll see if I like it
03since I kinda do want to watch more anime, I just hate the stupidly long never-ending stuff, which I assumed most shows were xD
03and most of the shorter ones haven't been dubbed x.x
Really good, definitely finish it drf
One of the few that could make me cry
03well the second boxset wasn't in stock
03and my friend isn't sure if it was even released
03there are individual DVDs but not a boxset LOL
03so I figure I'll just watch the first 25 or so episodes to see if I even like the show

10He's mocking us

12Why did I click that
12>.<
10which clearly isn't the case, as I listen to anything I find interesting
I'm sure there's people like that but not everyone

You don't like The Hunger Games?
12I seriously look like someone who's been dragged forwards in time from the 80's XD
:.
Or Warriors?

/me 12throws Sega controller at HML
Thank you, I needed a spare controlled
I really liked the first two series for Warriors, then it got old
12I can't type today
*controller
12D:<
But The Hunger Games is supposed to be great, I haven't read it yet though
Hurr, boring books
Not a surprise
12I've seen the movie
12now I need to get the books
My mom did the same thing!
So that's not an issue
:>
12SHEEP
Just because you like something popular, doesn't mean you're a sheep
Dubsheep, TwiSheep, GameSheep, iSheep, you name it, I'm listening to them riight now
10Can't say that if you have never read them
I have a book on Google
10You can say you dislike the concept of the story, but not the actual books themselves
It is NOT informational
Can you correct me on that?
10Good books don't have to be informational.
10Good books are for entertainment purposes too
You missed the point
10I doubt you even know what entertainment is
I meant that as a question
10Mr. play mindless video games all day
12lol
10I corrected you
Not anymore, nothing is really entertainment with all the trash flowing around
No
What's not trash?
You corrected the wrong thing
If you mind me asking
Anything that is good and deserves to be good? I don't see many people hating Shakespeare these days
:>
10>yet you bash hipsters
10You seem to be one, only liking things until they become 'overrated' or 'mainstream'
Uh
Not exactly true
As only I only would have known or cared about them after they were mass popularised

10They do not differ from each other by much
hey LL: you talked about how theres 2 different versions of Forest Temple
10Although I give credit to DRF for cooling down a bit with the Apple thing
is this the version you like http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmsZyC0UXUU

:<
04AAAAWWWW ARE YOU SERIOUS
DRF
when I was on the freeway
DID YOU GET NNURDEREDBY
A BUS
or acar?
;gg;
the "check engine" came on...
*light
:c
I'm like an hour from school
so
I hope I can make it back
12hai Danny
Are you on the roadside?
12y u txting
um
I'm at the store
I just got there
ooh
12oh
with less than a gallon of gas lert
*left
but
buy gas?
.v.
usually check engine !=low fuel
I will, if my car lives long enough
oh
the other thing
6check engine?
it's not raining, but something started squirting onto my windshield
from under the hood id imagine
6that light goes on for a ton of things, it might not even be deadly serious
6you should be fine
my dad just paid like $800 to fix some leaks
I hope they didn't make it worse x.x
6if they did, they're liable
6so yeah
hmm
well I guess I cal let my dad know about it
I should be fine to drive an hour on the freeway back to school?
after I fill up the gas that is
6should be
alright
6like I said, the light goes on for a lot of things
well yeah
6but it's likely it's something simple
6like my van's light was on for 8 months
but it's a 12 year old vehicle
6turns out it was a couple tubes that had holes in them
it might just die LOL
6the van is actually 11 years old lol...
well
07stop by an auto zone or some other car place that does free engine light readings
6cars shouldn't just die at 12 years old
don't you generally want to get it looked at asap?
6whats the mileage and how well do you guys keep it?
well it IS Ford
/me runs
6well yeah drf
ug
*uh
6but ASAP doesn't literally mean DROP EVERYTHING, SHOP NOW
like 120,000 miles
6not unless something is bad
6...
6only 120? O_o
yes
6god that thing should be fine for a while
07but it's a FORD
my dad didn't drive much
6true
6but still
6it /should/ be fine for a while longer
07my jag used a ford engine and died before that lol
6jag?
so Auto Zone will check it out for free even if I don't have them fix it? XD
07jaguar
6you had a jag?
07it was my mom's
6oh
great
still stuck on that answer
07so it was my first car cuz she wasn't around lol
6I had no idea auto zone did free check ups
/question
07and yeah they do
nice
I should do that
Troll
07they basically pop the hood and hook up a code reader to the car
/me stabs everyone and vanishes

hm
;-;
if a mouse is "USB Only"
i hate crosswords
will that not work with a USB -> PS/2 adapter?
for older computers
Just mean it only has a USB plug
Those USB > PS/2 adaptors can be kinda b0rk at times anyway
k
so all USB mice should work?
well
with Win98/Me
it worked with a lotigech USB KEYBOARD
but not mouse
No clue
o.i
*o
hm Xanbreon, do heatsinks on DDR2 RAM matter at all?
most of these don't have them
Not really
k
DDR4 RAm
Will have an entire fan
:D
hm
Centon is a good brand, right?
never heard of them
I have a flash drive by them
the other brands are Crucial and PNY
Kingston is too expensive
12o.o
I always like OCZ tbh
don't see any
hm
I don't have any branded flash drives
I'm so lulz
:>
here's Patriot
There fine
no wait
that's laptop ra,
m
I need desktop
Just go for timing
these don't say
Every brand gets bad sticks
07I have patriot desktop ram
K
well
Yeh, if it doesnt tell you the timings its probs crap
this is DDR2 which is getting harder to find
07mainly cuz they were on sale when I went to Fry's lol
well the lylzy thing
*lulzy
a 4GB 'kit'
as in, 2x2GB
is $60
Does the kit
a single 2GB
Have a soldering gun
is $27
;D
LOL
figure that out
Uhh
No clues
so ill just buy 2 2GB
LOL
a soldering iron
07well
yea right
27*2= 60-6
:O
Matching sticks is always better
07are they dual channel
RAM memory is SMD/SMT
plus ultra sensitive to static electricity
um
aren't all DDR2 dual channel?
uh well
07not if you don't buy them as pairs
well duh
..
but I'm buying 2
Only really if you match the sticks up :s
As long as you have sets it works
Matching is always better
But non matched sticks work fine
tell that to my laptop
well
But they will always default to the specs of the lowest stick
this has CAS latency 5
I just looked it up
that's fine, right?
DDR2 800
> Accidentally brought a 1333 mhz DDR3 chip, laptop only supports a max of 1066
heck, I should get 4
since
the 2x2GB I have
are diff brands
>_>
12brb
so if all 4 are the same, it'll work better?
How did you do that?
Well
8GB max, I wanna max it out
HML
make sure the timings are the same
:|
07just pairs of two
I pulled them from a PRE BUILT COMPUTER
LOL WOW
and it had 2 different brands
odd, right?
yep
yeah
may
...
oh
I know what happened
one of them broke
07but all 4 speeds should be the same
and my dad replaced it
You should match timings and latency etc, voltages etc
yeah
ill just buy 4 identical sticks
that'll work for sure :P
07why are you building something outdated in the first place lol
I'm upgrading it, rather
and because I can
:P
LOL wow
so the stick I brought from the store, the 1333mhz one
it's a pretty legit HTPC case
I like it :P
All the timings are 1 higher than the internal chip
I suck
also micro center is stupid sometimes
"patriot desktop memory"
Though, I haven't seen any problems yet
>picture is laptop memory
LOL
>actual item is laptop memory
-_
-
...fail
:<
...yep trololol
2 2GB sticks is $60
Your Truck won't start?
oh
AND that's CL6, the singles are 5
that's stupid
DRF
Opposite here
buying 4 singles :P
07link?
The singles are more expensive
than the kit
:|
12O.o
that's how it's supposed to be
hence why they even sell kits
:P
anyway bbl, gotta shop around some more
and hope I don't die in a giant explosion due to an engine failure :P
Be

Can I have his computers
If he does die
;>

Umbreon
have you used MGSE or gnome 3?
gnome i might have
how the HELL do you get the taskbar stuff blinking?
xchat isn't flashing when I get highlighted etc.
on gnome 2 it worked fine
but on linux mint 12 running MGSE/gnome 3 it's not
is it disabled in the settings?
I can't find it anywhere
xchat's settings are fine
i'm trying to think
since i don't rely on the taskbar in linux mint 12
i just downloaded an application called docky
XD
Ah
I use Avira or whatever it was called, forgot the name
and i pin all my most used programs to it
to dock applications
Ah
Well I kinda rely on the taskbar
system tray is blinking fine
:/
and I kinda dislike MGSE
I don't like gnome 3
gnome 2 is <3
gnome 3...bleh
i saw gnome 4.3
hm

6What year?
03I've used whatever Ubuntu 9.04 uses
10You came here
I have a feeling it's MGSE/gnome 3 doing it
but I can't be sure
and yeah linux hates AMDs
6 3 and 3/4 years ago..
03honestly, what do you even do on Linux that you can't do on Windows
03for servers I can understand but eh
6well...thats how long it has been since i havent been on...
10well, I've been here nearly 4 years
6oh ok
10Maybe you left right around the time I arrived
6i probably have
drf I just like it more :x
6I had another friend from alaska who showed me this site...
but really
10Welcome back, nonetheless.
03well you might be forced to switch :P
thank you so much for helping me to set up windows
03I tried the whole Linux thing
how so?
03and was like
03screw it
03XD
03I mean if your Linux drivers won't work with the hardware
03unless you can deal with it just not workiung fully
03-u
yeah true
but tbh
I was really lucky
because everything so far has worked
without me needing to modify anything
03it worked on my laptop too, but I specifically got parts that would work on both OSes
6Well thank you :) I'm writing a story. it's about a girl whose life has been saved by a song...lol
03but that stupid CPU scaling thing
03just pissed me off
03enough to not run Linux natively
03and I haven't sinced

03as in, this guy left his PS3 on a shelf AS IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE, right
03and it broke
03he sends it in for warranty fixing
03and they tell him it was void for neglect
03because it had "too much dust" in it
03:P
03That's one of several Sony facepalms LOL
10Odd Sony
6*haha*
6Sony...
03he's like "let me get this straight, it's neglecting the console by leaving it in my media center like you indended, and because taking it apart voids the warranty, you expect me to clean the dust out HOW?"
03they were like "Um" and just hung up on him
03the dude even recorded the calls
10This invisalign bugs me
6LMFAO
03it was only after he posted it all over the Internet
6that is so stupid
03and Sony saw it
10They gave it to me for my bottom row teeth
03that they were like "OK fine" and replaced it
6HOW are you suposed to clean it then?
03but it made them look stupid, which is like :P
03that's the point
03My PS3 still works, but I hardly use it anyway
03and only for movies
03that, and my house isn't very dusty since we actually clean it
03Awesome
03Xbox 360 is by far my favorite
03I used to like the Wii but there wasn't very much good stuff for it
03and online multiplayer is where it's at, so yeah
03hm, good
03this random $5 retractable iPod charging cable I bought actually works
6the only games i have left on it is left for dead II and MW, COD and.....hold on lemme check

03and then got it replaced for free :P
6R U SEREAL KILLER?

03mine too
/me eats Cinnamon Toast Crunch
03but he said sereal
/me kills some RJ-45 Serial ports

lolol
6I PAID FRAKKING $399.99 for a 16 gig!
03I can't remember the terms
12o-o
03RhaiyneDay, this is one of the reasons I hate Apple
03and why I only bought the iPod used, not new
6I KNOW!!!!
03because they they don't make any money off me
i think RJ-45 is Ethernet
/me thoroughly prefers Android over iPod anything
03OK
and RJ-15 is dialup connection
6I do too
03so what's the technical name for serial?
03I know it has something similar to that

ewww
perl is for scripting babien00bs
6My teacher in woods, was like, don't get any of the finish or thinner on your skin, it will go through you blood stream and mess up your kidneys
C plz
:DF
6boobs?
noobs
c or C# is okay
6C flat
6kidding...
6i read that thing wrong...
oh god C
at least not C++
Umbreon
C++ is evil
do NOT do C++
;-;
it will rot your brains
6the babien00bs
try python or C
C# is apparently a better version of java
6hat is C plus plus?
You can also try Lua or Ruby on Rails
6ur bak!
XD
6lol
6and i am still *clueless* even though i have never watched that movie...
6she soundsl ike that one girl who voiced the cartoon of Sabrina the Teenage witch when iwas like 7

6*so many idlers*
heh Umbreon
Lua's apparently nice
you can also do PHP
o-o
o.o
perl is pretty powerful, though never really tried it
python and C are both pretty good
C has some horrible syntax but it's not as bad as C++

But Toshiba >HP > Dell > Apple
;D
um
hp is nothing like Toshiba
:|
Dell = Apple though
/me runs
At least Dell isn't crazy overpriced and low end
:p
Acer is good too
06ohhhh...laptop fight eh?
03Acer was good a little while ago, but I hate their malware
Acer, Asus, Toshiba are all good
hp is okay
Fresh Install Go?
12My laptop is a Compaq
/me throws in his Dad's new Asus with Win Vistrash, wich takes litterly 25 mins. to startup!
and EW Dell
03LOL
03why would it have Vista if it's new
03o.o
06like half a year old now
06it cant do much
06so im getting him to downgrade it to XP SP3
12...But after spilling that juice on it, half the keyboard and one speaker are ruined.
03or get Windows 7?
06wont hold it
12I like XP.
Upgrade it to Windows 7? :c
06XP was awesome
XP sucks now
03um
03if it can run Vista, it can run 7
03o_O
06nah
06not gonna try
XP was awesome
Yeah
*was*
now it's not :D
12Windows 8's pre-beta is apparently available for download now
06it has *TROUBLE* running vista, so its gonna be XP
12XP FTW.
06i still like it
Vista is harder to run then 7
03XP is fine but if it's a "new" laptop...
You should be running 7 anyway, pointless to install XP :|
And if it is a half decent laptop, XP might run worse
06hm
062.5GB RAM
that's more than enough
My laptop ran 7 fine with only 2GB
my laptop runs 7 fine with 8GB
/me hides
XD
I don't want to have a 64bit OS
;-;
what's wrong with 64-bit OSes?
Oh I'm in AZ btw :'D
I can't play 16bit games
like Chip's Challenge, Jezzball
:P
Why would you want to play those
Because I love them
:>
brrrrrrrr it's getting cold in here again
06erm
06Hyper
12derp
12yay, color works now
06i can actually run all games except DOS games on my *CUSTOMIZED* x64 OS O.o
04guys
04quick question about Emerald
herro herro
12ohai Drakey
04can you re-battle the gym leaders in Emerald as many times as you want?
04hiya
06i think so..
06ohaoi
I think you have to get challenged by them on the pokenav first, drake
12I don'ty think so Drake, but I *might* be wrong
12don't*
dont quote me on that either
k
04But I wanted to know if they would do it an unlimited amount of times
probably...
04Bulbapedia only shows 4 times, but it doesn't say "Stop challenging you"
12See, I've never tried to do that XD
04Just shows their team changes
> Customised
> Effort
I want to run it without dealing with different layers of emulation
Not to mention it's pointless for me on here as this thing doesn't have more than 4GB currently
06Hyper
06if you're LAZY, you wont get better games
What.
"better games"
I don't play new/'better' games
I rarely game on here anyway
if so, it's emulated SNES/N64 games
I don't need to customise Windows 7 just to do that
12derp
12herp
12need to work on it
12alright, again
Welcome to a world where the air I breathe is mine
04alright
04so

04I'll grab Pokemon Firered
/me hopes someone breaks out in song with him

Nope

03well this isn't an opera
03so we don't usually break out in songt
03-t
04and then start trading like hell in order to train
Well I was at least hoping someone would recognize the song
03I don't
where those lyrics I just said are from
12drffff, yesss, it is a opera!!!!!!!!!!

03>5th gen
04drf
12fair point
04we understand
04we don't need you reinstating your opinion every 5 seconds
12I saw a foil Zekrom card yesyerday but I couldn't get it >.<
04XD
03Drake it's not every 5 seconds
12I want it sooooo badly
04Sure as hell feels like it.
03I haven't bashed 5th gen in at least a week :<
03so it was due
04Anyway
12That's often the case
12sadly
04yeah
04And my team isn't strong enough to reliably beat the E4 for training
04highest level is 52

12:c
':d
03:c @ what?
12Drake's predicament
FFFFFFS
Assassin's Creed
Keeps crashing
it freezes and crashes on the second tutorial part
ffff
drfffffffffffffff
03hi
;____;
12hi
03well
03did you pirate it? LOL
yeah :x
03that's probably why
03it's probably some error with the crack or something
I actually didn't even install it properly because the stupid thing wouldn't install
eeeeeeeeeeeeh
03um
03yeah that's probably why
Well
It should work
Even though I haven't installed it fully
03I can help
/me runs
lmao
03OK seriously
That would be nice
03Windows does not work like Linux
I'm freezing my ass off
03you can't just "partially install" stuff
):
03if it has an installer, use it
linux doesn't like partially installed stuff either
it has an installer
03well
I tried usingit
03aren't a lot of linux programs just executanbles?
it got stuck on some random .forge file
03that you ./ ?
.bin files?
they still require the dependencies to be met
thus why I sometimes get into dependency hell
03LOL DEPENDENCIES
03yeah
03at least with Windows
03MOST of the time
03sensible programs will bundle the prereqs
yeah
03(which are basically dependencies)
same with linux
03Linux is like "LOL GO DO IT YOURSELF"
So you get tons and tons of repeated libs
03eh, I've had a lot of problems
well linux's package manager
03well
03I said SENSIBLE, Xanbreon
03the ons I've seen
03will go "Oh, you already have .NET framework, OK then"
03not like "let's just install another copy"
03but if you don't have it, it'll install it
The only case where you DO get a lot of dependency hell
is on ubuntu/debian/mint
03VMWare Tools
03I mean
03that too
.net framework is diff
when the bloody repos are crap
03actually VMWare Tools for Linux is quite good
and have old versions of stuff
03it just magically works
03xD
and you need the newer one
03but you have to chmod +x and ./ it
and then you need to install about 100 different .deb files from the damn debian site
12This is depressing http://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/2012/3/21/2d9a1daf-f1f6-4703-ab80-7c0c18e54e79.jpg
because the stupid god damn things don't do it for you
12whoa.
I had to do that once
it sucked
and in the end it didn't even work
so bawwwwww
12Looks like I just caught up after a crapload of lag O.o
so like
someone give me a good mmo or game in general to play
03Good MMO is like
03an oxymoron
03:)
03but uh, I have like
03every Star Wars game onS team
03never played any
03I'd give them all to you if I could
03there was some sale where you could get like every SW game ever for $50
03(well, up to when the sale was, I believe a year ago)
12:T
wait what?
o_O
even the ROTS game?
and Drake wants me to get TF2
I'm very iffy about it
tf2 fffkkkerr
03um
03also
03don't get TF2
03ever
03unloess you literally want to be spending every waking moment playing it
03and uh
TF2 is great
Shoo
like Feather
03<Xanbreon> Shoo
You can play TF2 in moderation
03that actually works.
Its just fun
/me runs
I like games like KH and SW: ROTS
03http://i.imgur.com/o3uzW.png
and podracer/racer revenge
03I got all of those for $50 total
KH = kingdom hearts?
03so it might not be every one ever but it's a lot
12~
yeah
O-o

/me runs

I have no idea
bad puns
gtfo drf
http://www.swtor.com/
it's pretty expensive and it's a monthly thing or whatnot
Oh you mean the MMO
I was only kidding anyway lol
yeah
you are a derp
of course I mean the MMO ):
/me f2k New Japan Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Derrick Inouye - Canon & Gigue (Pachebel) performed by String Quartet (2chFLAC@783kbps, 22.76mb/4:03)
):
You are losing your street cred NS
Tish tish
inb4 Kanon D Dur
hah!
inb4 tsk tsk
12O.o
/me still wants SW:TOR
03I'd give it to you if I could :(
03er
03oh
03I thought you meant Knights of TOR
03well um
03I could buy you the game + the 60 days, like they show on their site but I am not paying per month LOL
04who
04nickalerted
03though EW ORIGIN
03:|
Seriously, drf>
Seriously, drf?*
03it's $30
03i"m not buying the deluxe one
03LOL
03but I've bought games for people before
isn't it $80 still?
03so why not
03um
03no
03$30
03for the regular one
/me checks
standard says $80
but that might be the game
03um
03what
03oh
03it's $40
03http://buy.swtor.com/us/
03maybe it's because you're not in the US?
uh
03wait
/me checks again
03hm,
03the game itself is $40
03the 60 day thing is separate
Ah yeah
03I could get you the game
I'm not in the US
XD
03but you'd have to get the service
03as the US one prolly wouldn't work anyway
03but I'm sure the game wold
03yeah
Yeah probs
03I do that all the time with STeam
03my European friends will buy games through me
Doesn't matter, I was kinda joking anyway XD
03since it's usually the same price in $ as 
03so $20 is less than 20 etc
03so they'll just paypal me $20 to get the game xD

so what's that about the other steam games?
I barely even know how steam functions anyway
03http://hackedirl.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/epic-win-photos-warning-win.png
04NS
04Steam is just a program that tracks your games
04and lets you browse for others that it can track and manage
03Steam is basically a form of DRM :(
03and the servers die all the f'ing time
03and it's a pain in the a**
03but you need it for some stuff
hurp
03http://hackedirl.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/epic-win-photos-wrong-way-win.jpg
I dunno
I'm not a very big gamer
I prefer things like KH and SW:ROTS
and podracer
things I can actually play without failing at
unlike oblivion
Drake
any game suggestions?
BESIDES TF2
04on Steam?
yeah
or anything really
04Spiral Knights is fun for the first few days
04Star Wars Battlefront 2 on Steam as well
oh god battlefront
I STILL can't play that
03because that requires you to be running Windows *trollface*
/me runs
):
you can run steam via wine
04XD
quite well
03I seriously don't see why you insist on Linux so much LOL
03I mean
03I get that you use it on your other computers
I'm on windows atm lol
03but why not just keep one with Windows
03Yeah but the whole dualboot thing
it HAS windows
03doesn't mean you'll use it :P
Drake the photoshop one was so lol
(lold irl)
04XD
OH COOL ASSASSIN'S CREED EXISTS
Steam runs quite well under wine
I might actually grab my oblivion disk and install it on it
even though I SUCKED at said game
You just generally suck >;3
):
okay coooooooome on I want to game for a bit at least
and then move tintower to its new serv
03so do you want a game or not XD
03I can gift yous omething
03inb4 you ask for the most obnoxiously expensive thing on Steam'
TF2 you derp
:D
03that's free
03but EW HIGHLY ADDICTIVE GAMES
Its fun
03>Highly addictive
Pfft
I dunno drf
Everything can be addictive
any suggestions?
04I will keep repeating TF2, but other than that I don't know much.

03well, L4D2 and such
> EW ADDICTIVE GAMES
03that's probably the only game I really use Steam for
what IS L4D2 about anyway?
etcetc
03L4D2 isn't really addictive
03it's a zombie shooter
03but team-bsaed
03*based
shooters
nope.avi
034-player humans fighting zombies
03OK
pfft
03I can get you one of the SW games via Steam if you want LOL
/me ponders
Matter of opinion~
03tbh
03I hate shooters too
03but L4D is an exception
03dunno why, it's just fun
>__>
03but stuff like COD can die in a fire
empire at war looks interesting
and I remember the ultimate sith edition of TFU
the ending was interesting
03hm Xanbreon, ever used Symantec/Norton Ghost?
but I didn't like killing darth vader
EW NORTON
03I agree
03but Ghost is useful
Blerg Norton
03mine is Symantec
03I stole it from work
I wouldnt touch anything made by them
03before they required regkeys
03well
03it's a bootable image
I know what it is
03that you run and it can create images of HDDs
03well
03the newer ones also install
03on Windows
03which I don't get the point oif
03*of
03well I ask because
any good space flight simulators?
mhm?
03for some reason, the one I have doesn't seem to recognize my hard drive if I have AHCI enabled
03I have to IDE emulate it
03and I dunno why
03works on other PCs
probs a AHCI bug
03I got XP to work with it
03I just got AMD's achix86 drivers and slipstreamed it
Mhhm
03not sure why XP doesn't like USB floppy drives
03or I'd just do the F6 thing
hey drffffffffffffff
03sec
03hm
03sure I guess
ofu
03did you already register for Steam?
sec this laptop is almost out of battery
uh
no
I will do that
03well
03I can send it via email
03but direct is easier
alright
what do I need to run steam games?
besides a computer
03that's it really
03it varies from game to game
03newer games need more processing power etc
well this one I should be able to run
03yeah
03you should be able to run most things, it seems like a pretty decent laptop :P
What laptop is that?
HP Pavilion Dv6 6c20TX
Ahh, nice
so uh drf
I don't need to download some steam client or whatnot?
03yes
03steampowered.com or whatever
):
I'm registering
03once you do
03add me as a friend
03and I can gift that game
meh all my usual usernames are taken but I expected that
Drake
what should I use
Rathicus or Dragoran?
04...for?
03and well
04Dragoran
03once you sign up, you can change the display name
actually Dragoran is taken
03Feather changes hers all the fricking time LOL
04oh Steam
04yeah
04NS it doesn't matter
):
03well it only matters for logging in
04chose an obscure username, and change your display name later
03and what you tell people :P
03nah
03because then if someone wants to find you
03to add you
03they have to find that
03I think
04yeah
04I think so
03exactly
04Which is why no one can find my account :<
03inb4 that was on purpose
secret questions are retarded
03yeah
03I disabled all the security crap on mine
03SteamGard pisses me off
03*Guard
secret questions
only open up more security holes tbh
04also uraaloser is an obscure Monster Hunter joke so if you think I am being unoriginal you are dumb
it's easier to crack a security question
03>social engineering
03so yeah
than it is to crack a password
half the time the security question is the idiot's IRL name or username
You cant code around idiots
Steam guard is great though
03EW STEAM GUARD
03it pisses me off since I actually let people borrow my account
03to try games
03and achievement farm for me *cough*
I personally have quite a lot of cash invested in my account, and 2 factor authentication is great
03I have a ton too but it's not like people are going to try to hack mine or something
03I mean, I don't trust you, but most other people :P
;)
Steam accounts are big targets, so meh
03my Xbox Live was hacked, Steam hasn't been
03so make of that what you will
03because it's special
03I dunno
03er wait
03what
03oh
Oh yeh XBL is another big target
03I think I got botnetted for that one :/
03but MS was good about refunding me
03for what the idiots spent
03AND I got to keep the games they bought
uh
drf
03no duh
uh
how do I add you
this layout is confuzzling
03are you using the softwre?
03*ware
no...
03hm
03lemme check on the site then
hit community
I'm installing it atm
Look to the right, there will be a search bar
03hm
03yeah I don't see an add option in there like in the client
03in the program you just click Friends, Add friend LOL
Find someone
hit the add friend button
O_o
I CAN'T CLICK ADD FRIEND
Are you logged in?
03it must hate you

It cant find you
O-o
o_O
have you verified your email etc?
I just did
try again
Found you
it says "some features only become available once you have a game in your account"
deeeerp
Just add TF2
Its free
o_o
03ah
03it happened with Feather too
03before I gifted her a game
03after you redeem it you should be fine
Ah
well
you can add me drf
Xanbreon added me
03just did
03fricking accept it already
/me hides
okay done
wtf
why is tf2 10GB
that's like
a bloody 6th of my monthly bandwidth
10gig is pretty small for a game these days
03resist the urge to play that crap
03:(
Frack off drf, you play music games, you cant talk :P
03those at least end at some point
03once I've played all the good songs
03XD
Self defined point
"good"
etc
Same diff
lmao
well
I don't really mind
I'm not going to download it
03alright you should be set
03redeem it and it'll let you do whatever :P
thaaaaaaaaaaaaaaanks
/me hugs drf
03np
03I dunno why Steam does that
Few more games and you might get boobs ;)
03"you have to actually have a game before you can add friends"
03From what I've heard though, TF2 DOESN'T count
03because it has to be a PAID game
Aahh
03Feather only played TF2 and wasn't able to add friends
Anti spam
03until I gifted her something
03yeah
03but what pisses me off
03I gifted her L4D2
03and her stupid laptop
03can't handle it
03>_>|
03granted it was only $5 but LOL
Should have checked the requirements
SEE Xanbreon
Thats old
not as bad as 10GB
I'm downloading at 1.1mbs
03<Xanbreon> Should have checked the requirements <- she said the demo ran "OK"
03but then actual online matches lagged LOL
03and this is why laptops sucks
03-s
03if she had a desktop I'd be like "go buy a better GPU"
my laptop is good though ):
03yeah
although the cpu isn't the best
03it's also new
03she has some $300 Dell
03:P
lmao
dells are kinda crap
>monitors
03well
03Dell's monitors
03are good
oh yeah drf
03I have two
the speakers in this laptop
3Video: Dell ST2220L(Digital) on NVIDIA GeForce GTX 460 SE (1920x1080x32bpp 60Hz)

I'm serious
03well yeah

03Dr. Dre Beats and all that crap
03WEBCAM :O
/me runs

03not now obviously
03it's like
035am
03and I'm not even tired
03for some reason
03LL sissied out and went to bed around 4 :(
well I'll need to install things

Actually, im supprised the demo ran better than online
AI must take less cpu then online junl
junk
03probably
04?
03I don't think it was the CPU
03but the graphics
03the demo is only two parts of one level
03so maybe the other levels needed more power
L4D etc and source games in general are quite cpu heavy
Due to all the physics and stuff
03I know LL's laptop could run the "normal" levels, but for Cold Stream it crapped out and froze
03but EW ONBOARD GRAPHICS
03on *any* computer, desktop or laptop
03:(
lmao
Ah, probs running out of ram etc
03I buy my crap with no onboard chips
mine isn't onboard graphics
03if possible
03well
I think
03yours is hybrid
03onboard/dedicated
yeah
03AMD mobile does that
03my sister's Dell is the same way
03but
03for somer eason
03her Dell
03uses the onboard for *Everything*
03I had to manually add crap to the list to use dedicated
._.
03and just added IE and Skype as that's all she uses
lmao
03College female = Facebook + Skype
03but eh
03I was the one who insisted that she get a "good" laptop
XD
03she'd be fine with some $200 Acer crap
03She's like "you're a computer person, just find me a laptop"
03OK, Dell whatever that's about $1100
03it was the only 15" with a numpad
03EW LAPTOPS WITH NO NUMPADS
ew numpads
03even though the XPS was better specs
03no numpads
03I actually use the numpad quite a bit
the one I have now has a numpad
I hate it
03I hate you
03I mean
03I'm just anal and refuse to give up a numpad
03hence why I went for a 15" screen and not 13-24
03*14
03I'd be fine with a 13-14" laptop but meh, I want a numpad
lmao
I should be writing my essay
03LOL Windows XP
not playing games
03"Does this computer connect to the INternet?" *skip setup* "Would you like to activate online?"
03Um, if I didnt'set up a connection, HOW
lmao
xp uses magic
03yeah
it hacks into the nearest network by itself
03at least Vista/7 don't ask you to activate it automatically
03it just does it in the background
yeah
03XP was like ACTIVATE ME PLX
lmao
03I have a working crack though
03for XP
03works on any service pack/version, never had probs
There's lots of working keys for XP
03well;
03keys != activation
03for example
03that key I gave you for Windows 7
03"works"
03but it won't activate
03unless you abuse their phone system
03:P
03with XP, I'm lazy and just run a batch file
03to do it
you abused their phone system rather quickly
03yeah
03because I've done it a lot
03you just punch the numbers in and type in what they give you
