03This is like
03one of the best quotes I have ever seen
03<Casey8> Diana Ross' husband died
03<Tarrier> how
03<Casey8> fell while climbing in South Africa or something
03<JennAway> that's sad
03<Bubbaprog> i guess there is a mountain high enough
03I've been quoting that IRL and forgot where it came from, but there it is
2 pages x-x
stupid mIRC froze
03LOL

03exactly.

03I'd play that.
someone thought it'd be a great future version of the sitcom

03<Fraeon> I have found an awesome reason to become emo
For some reason, when I did a repair on my 7 partition, my Documents folder become a system folder and was hidden
fixed it though, whee
First time that has ever happened to me too
03<truefalse> I was at the bus stop and saw a poster of Voldemort with 'HP 7' printed on it.

04Still mad at me NS?
I'm okay
thanks for asking
04:/
04?
about Rhy/Nathan/Leonard
had some punctuality errors
04Oh nice
04Can I read it?
didn't
I already give it to you?
It's the one where Rhy hides in the cupboard
and bawwwwwws
04Oh
04that one yeah
yeah
Wasn't even that good
hah
Intelligent or descriptive?
04Intelligent
04XD
that makes me feel awesome
good to know my usual writing style isn't intelligent
04You know I'm here to please you
hah
SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
etc.
/me dodges
):
hi
04like
04Hey NS
04You know that thing
04on TST
04the "TST Couples" topic?
oh yeah
04Can we end that thing
I don't think anyone really cares
/me hides
and it's kinda awkward to say "hey guys, we decided we don't like each other anymore"
04fair enough
XD
/me teleports
well, people actually say that?
orly
04not much anymore
heh
hah
well
hmm don't remember the last time i logged in
to those forums
04This week
and I can't access most sites anyway
>DER laptop
04Your laziness is truly glorious NS- oh
only reason I'm on mIRC on the DER laptop
is because safe mode
I'm also running PuTTy and VNC
fun
/me is awesome
04yikes
/me ^5s too
I also have a theory
seeing as it only seems to affect IE
but
that could easily just be port 443/80
actually
it is
but it doesn't seem to work
and IE is gay anyway
04o-o
because blocked sites
04so I had to use IE ;_;
._.
04XD
but I can tolerate it
because yeah
>DER laptops
>finding workarounds
:D
only thing I don't like about safe mode
bbl!
04Whenever you type DER laptops
sorry for being all not here and such:<
at all
04I actually think of you saying "DERR!"
which sucks
04Bye Espeon
hah
seeya Xeli
seriously though
I can write in most styles
I just choose to write things in different ways
04But you don't usually.
Reminiscence is a completely different style to that fic I wrote for english
because one, that fic needed to be profound
for marks
and two, Reminiscence is more about action
and reminiscing, thus the name
and philosophies
it'd be weird in that fic's style
04I named the first chapter of DoI "Reminiscence" because it's the only thing that fit that wasn't obscenely long.
04It was originally "You're not much of a Femme Fatale" but that's too long and doesn't really suit it.
hah
well
Reminiscence does need more description and detail tbh
most of it makes me cringe
it's not the sort of fic that really shows what's happening
but rather describes and /almost/ tells but not quite
04hurr
04The problem with me
04is that I don't really have a writing style yet
I shift writing styles depending on the occasion
04And the use of adjectives isn't always good
my endings often feel rushed
and my beginnings can feel a bit unanswered as well
and yeah
speech is bare
unless you do it well
apparently I did it quite well in the Rhy cupboard fic
04I do it poorly.
04at least IMO
but that's because Rhy was being a whiny bitchy kid in a tantrum
and that's easy to write
yeah
04one sec
do hurry
I haven't showered
I still need to play piano
aaaaaaaand you smell like 1 2
04:<
but uh
I need to sleep early
I'm exhausted
04yeah you do
And I need to get up at 5:15am tomorrow
cus' band
and the day after
soooooooooooooooooooo
I'm screwed
wing it!
04haaaah
04NS
04I got 20/50 on my maths exam AFTER I corrected some marks
04also
04http://pastebin.com/xu7EsQ7N
04also I'm screwed for my English Ext speech
04meant to be 6-8min and I think I barely reach 4 minutes
._.
just uh
repeat things
and talk slowly
no no
04Talking slowly is my best hope
you're meant to do it as unlisted
not repeat things
go into unneeded details
unlisted
04and drag it out
for pastebin
/me avoids
04ok ok
/me changes
hurry
need to go soon
04http://pastebin.com/xu7EsQ7N
04there
'exercise,'
should be 'exercise',
04oh
probably make that 'but' instead of 'and'
or well
'but even then, at the con-etc.etc.'
04uh-huh
should be was not were
comma after 'body part'
that extra very kills the flow of the speech/sentence
get rid of it
18.
that makes no sense at all
topics are completely different
that of isn't needed
no need for the in order
should be 'tis not tis
same with Irres' next line
comma after done
it's pretty damn good
anyway poof

12yeah, no more topic :/
12brb
Hello.
7Hey guys
7Eh, I guess the place is pretty empty right now, huh?
7I guess I'll see you guys around then
7Hey Dari
7can't really talk. playing SR3
12ohai
hi
hi
7'Afternoon, everyone.
Hey.
7Everyone alright? P:
12yep
7Good, good.. whatcha up to?
12nothing much tbh XD
7Haha XP Me neither
12looks like this place is starting to fill up with users
7Yep
7Eh, I wouldn't know, I joined yesterday.
12you should still try
12needs the activity
12As much as I respect the owner, he‚Äôs not really playing his part in keeping this place active
7Again, I wouldn't really know.
12-active
7Maybe. If someone/ I made a good roleplay I'd be very active there.
7And that would probably revive the RP threads a little, and the activity would expand. Maybe.
SR hasn't really done much sitewise for a while.
But as for site updates, nothing.
7Hum..
He's not really interested in Spyro any more, but he's keeping the site up anyway.
7Ah. Well, we should be thankful for that at least.
Whoops
Cya
7Byee xP
Yep. :<
12yeah
aww I missed someone >.>
I havent seen him idle in a real long time
12same
12I should kick ChanServ?
/me runs
12jk
lol
:/
I need to idle for a bit, bbl
12see ya
back
12wb
lol
yeah exactly one hour
are you still doing classwork?
12not today, fortunately
12XD
:P
Ive been on spring break all week
12I wish I got breaks
I didnt really get to do much though, was busy doing other things
12do you have MK7?
12(Mario Kart 7)
12ah
you wanted to play?
PS2 for best console of all time
Why PS2?
If you wanna talk about a system that can play older games theres the gameboy
and up
you mean the system itself?
12the DS passed the PS2 in sells last year
You mean the DS in all of its incarnations, or an individual type?
DS, DS lite, 3DS, etc
you mentioned the advanced didnt look as good as the color
12just DS, DS Lite and DSi
oh
123DS is a entirely different consol
12console*
consoles*
12those are
12but, they all played different games
12games*
12where as, the DSi and DS Lite played the same games
12yes, but the Gameboy couldn't play gameboy colour games
I thought it really looked awesome when I tried playing them on the tv
12same
12also, the PS2 had a few incarnations
12Slim and regular
Wiki still lists PS2 as best selling, above DS.
Though only by 2.5m
12that got outdated a few months ago
Is that old then?
12ah, see
12http://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-2-Console-Slim-Black/dp/B000TLU67W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1333948486&sr=8-1
unless you wanna pay a lot for it
that one is the slim version
12you would want the slim one though
why?
12the old one is huge XD
but I like the tray
The old PS2 which I have is smaller than my slim PS3
the PS3 slim is really stripped down compared to the actual PS3 from 2006
I think PS2 is actually still beating the DS
That's as of January?
Was it really recent that the DS took over?
Hmm
12it's still close though, even without 3DS sells
12yeah
I could never stick with the PS2
12same
Atari still rocks :)
12PS2, DS, 3DS and PS3 are my favs
12and wii
I have a PS2, PS3, and Wii, for non-handheld consoles.
PS1 is probably still around somewhere. XD
12as for older ones, N64, GBC and PS1 were my favs XD
those are all the consoles you have?
12and Gamegear
12nope
12GameGear was awesome
I never had N64, GBC, SNES/NES. :<
awww
Theres a bunch of consoles I wanna own
12N64 was awesome, however you can download the best N64 games on the wii
Ive been wanting to get my hands on a sega master system
12if you do, get all the Zelda N64 games
12those were awesome
I prefer cartridges
12it can't really
unless you havent played it before
12yeah, but then you don't have to worry about the N64 remote breaking XD
?
12Controller*
I only had one break on me but that was because it wasnt an official controller
12my parents never got official ones :/
12Skyward sword, TP and Majora's Mask are my favs
I'm probably old fashion *shrugs*
^
yeah!
12true, but I ended up with a bunch of un-official N64 controllers
you can still buy em
12which is a pain XD
12true
just try looking in 2nd hand stores
I gotta go
12see ya
see you two laters
Hm
12yep
Oh and ChanServ, how could I forget poor ChanServ.
:P
12LOL
Did you come to the IRC first then, or the forums, in terms of SF?
I'd guess the IRC?
12yep
12found this channel on mibbit search
Ahh
LLOTS used to be a member of SF
12really?
12you should visit more
12well, pony fans tend to also be spyro fans XD
12same, only it was people at TST XD
12liking*
Now I like the songs, lawl.
It grew on me I suppose
12LOL same
Hah
They brainwash you the more you watch. :P
12indeed
brief*
You tell anyone IRL that you watch it?
12it*
12yep, but only when I find out they do too
Ahh, I haven't told any friends, only family.
12so far I've only told one XD
12and my family knows
:o?
12fault*
Ahh
12something people should never ask me XD
Heh.
How'd they react to it? XD
12well, they were just like "... OK"
12lmao
Hahahaha
I had my revenge anyway, heh.
12XD
You have any pony merch?
12nope
12nice
Took it with me when we went to climb some the highest peaks in the UK - got some weird looks when I was taking photos with it on the top. :P
12LOL nice XD
Got some pretty good pictures though.
Nice views up there.
12indeed
12I don't think I'
12I've ever been that high before
03http://autocowrecks.failblog.org/2012/04/08/mobile-phone-texting-autocorrect-if-angry-birds-was-made-years-earlier/
12dumb enter key
Lawl, everyone does that with the enter key. XD
12yep XD
well it sorta does
all those harmonics
12then you feel like you have to type fast before someone goes lolwut
XD
I know dat feel
12XD
Yeah, I dunno why, but when I see a mountain, I just get this feeling of 'I HAVE TO CONQUER YOU!'.
And it's worth it for the awesome views, and the feeling when you reach the peak.
12true
If you have any good peaks near you, you should go try it.
12there's one I should try, but I don't think it's as high as that one XD
‚îì(Ôæü„ÉòÔæü;)‚îèÔæü
12there where some good ones in AZ
12(Arizona)
03http://artoftrolling.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/internet-troll-isnt-that-just-racist.jpg

mhhm?
http://www.imgur.com/YG5tM.jpg <- ever had this happen with adw?
where the dots don't rotate back
seems to happen to me all the time :/
Think its a common problem
http://www.imgur.com/YG5tM.jpg
er
well
look at the middle things too
You can get a slider above the dock, or even dots at the top of the screen
And 5 item dock > 3 items
http://www.imgur.com/YG5tM.jpg
...
You have pasted the same link 3 times now
;P
;)
http://www.imgur.com/MDeGT.jpg
there
see the 3 dock icons?
Mhhm
those get screwed too :/
basic ADW is kinda buggy
does ex have that problem?
The dots are gone though
but the dock doesn't screw itself?
Pretty sure it doesnt
hm
can I get it to look more 'flat' and not like a bookshelf?
The dock? sure, just swap the background or turn it off in the theme settings
I couldn't figure out how o.o
Theres a frackton of dock themes
well
Tis in themes
if I could get ex to look like the free one...
Sure, apart from the dots
why can't I get the dots :(
Because they where removed
gaaaaay
well
you could turn them off
NOU
>_>
moar features moar bugs
can I get some sort of buttons down there to switch screens without swiping?
that's why I like the dots, just tap to switch :P
Let me see
Gotta install adw again >_>

yeah, it comes with CM9, right?
Mhhm
They had more options, that I wouldnt use
but meh, I hated CM9 ICS, it was buggy as frick and the GUI looked 'dumber'
And didnt have the same "smooth" feel
more iPad like and less power user
well that and LOL droid 2
haven't tried any custom ROMs on here
I hate HC GUI.

The dock thing?
Oh forgot about that bit
2s
I know you can have dots at the top of the screen
yeah
those are just indicators though
Doesnt seem to be anything todo that
yes
just tapping the corners is easier and faster
I only need 3 dock things
I intentionally keep it at 3 :/
urgh, 10% batt
and well
contacts is part of the phone app
text I keep on the main screen, habits
ICS, people app ;)
And even when they where combined in GB
I always had two icons

Old style labels from before they rebranded everything blue/green/black
03LOL, it's been sitting around that long?
03uh
03it says date 05 MAR 2012
03so no
03they're just lazy
03if you look closely it says Recertified
03it's a special label they use for those apparentyl
03unlike a year or two ago when they'd send me one that looked like retail
Yeh probs
03some of my caviar greens were replacements that look identical to my store-bought ones
03apparently people would RMA drives and resell them or some crap

03there's also one called F You
03there are 3 versions
03:P
03no, but i Mean
03they changed the word to "F"
03:P
06i know
06Lame Rephrase
03that was long before Forget Yo
03u
/me facepalms
03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71XXSin4lc
03before they had an official title for the clean one
03it was that
03:P
03they didn't change it to "forget you" for a couple months after
06i know
06as i first said
06"Lame rephrase"
03well you were playing the actually dirty version :P
03also EW 128kbps
06just because they dont like to say swears
03go quality wh0re some more
03...this version doesn't say the swear words either, derp
03it's still a clean version
03just a DIFFERENT clean version
06..
06still wimps imo
06xD
03well
03contrary to popular belief, swearing does not in fact make you cool
03:P
06i know
06i dont swear
06i think the idea of rephrasing the song 2 times AND re-editing it is kinda stupid
03just not play it on the radio at all?
06like, swearing is a frown, but being a wimp and not taking it is also stupid
03I'm sure swearing in whatever language people speak there is worse than in English

Fair play. :P
7I should've been doing IT coursework really, but the course is a pile of shit.
03so hm
03o_O
I hate exams too though.
I just hate work.
:P
7I don't mind exams. I despise coursework. I much prefer exams.
14g2g
14good night
10yeah, as mine is still there
03I think timeline lets you hide it
7Exams are just /over/, you know? coursework drags
03yeah, see my conversation with Arti on her profile
03apparently it'll hide the email by default
03or something
03and yeah I hate timeline
03it looks ugly and I actually really like the "info" pane
As long as it's not English coursework it's probably piss easy though.
03it reduces that to some crappy tiny thing
12facebook*
7oh yeah it's easy. but it's fuckin' long as.
10I figured out how to hide it
12I don't see the point
12I mean
10Can you confirm, DRF?
Hmm
10It is my personal gmail.
12ah
10Someone confirmmmm
10NightSeas, check my Info and scroll to email

10no.
03WHen they first added that
10It's like THG, the story's decent, but >fanbase
03I was like "b*** please"
03and even now I think I only have like two things LOL
12I know
03LOL STORY IS DECENT
03Isn't that the overstatement of the century
10IT IS
/me hides
10The Hunger Games > Twilight however
10Twilight is a fad
03agreed, but replace THG with * and that works
03o/` you're a fad, which means something that we already had, but once you're gone you don't come back o/` </Dr. Dre>
03apparently my friend thought Katniss was hot
03I disagree
03she's just "eh"
10yeah
03there were no hot girls in that movie, which was totally disappointing :<
/me runs

10Hurr
10What movie has a hot girl in it then?
03Hot Rod.
03and no that's not some sort of joke, that's the actual title
03also Easy A

03what is
7wow

03there's only one, LOL
03well yeah
03:P
03anyway
03I don't see movies just because certain people are in them
12she's okay
13He be overrated :D
03it's typical fangirl behavior, seeing movies just because an actor you like is in them
03I'm sure some guys do that but it's not as typical XD
12Johnny Depp is overrated
03agreed
12although he is a good actor, but still overratted
03basically
03anything good is overrated
0399% of the time
03:P
12true
12so I'm overratted? :D
03rather, anything good and popular

03I mean
12LOL
03I watch everything with closed captions
03as in, same-language subtitles
03but that's because I can just read it if I mishear
03never even heard of it o.o
03see
03I liked Bleach
03well
03why watch 1/3 of the show only to have to wait?
03I'd rather just wait
03LOL
13Ew Bleach
13it belongs in the toilet
13:3
12Wolfs rain had fillers
03Bleach was actually pretty good

03not sure why LOL
12Kiba and Cheza got annoying
12Kiba got annoying when he became obsessed with cheza
12Kiba was fine, but Cheza needed to GTFO
12LOL
12Kiba was good in the first episodes
12yeah

03That was like
03the most creative drawing ever
/me runs
03no

03I was guessing their drawing
03:P
03that same person
6my friends and I
6get way too into this
12oh
6and also completely out of it
03the word was "white"
DRF liek magical gurls
lol
03also gah
03I can't seem to get screenshots to work in Draw Something anymore
03since it involves holding the search button and that app hijacks it
03still trying to screenshot this drawing
6how do you take screenshots on an android?
03you need root
6or is that phone specifc
6oh
03it's both
03some phones have it built in
03mine doesn't
03so I have an app
03you just long-press search
12there's even hyper cams for android
6um
6kick one of them
03can I kick both
/me hides
Resh= ReshZek200) Haii= HaiiTehReshiram
XD
6preferably the longer name
6oh ok
kick all
of nthem
aww
;<
10wait
which was me. )
10there's an app for screenshot?
6yeah we know
03yes
03iof you have root
03*if
DURR
:p
03there's a few apps
10Well
10>root
10:I
03I used to use one called ShootMe
03but that requires you to shake the phone
I tried to root Sky's droid
03is called drocap2
10better than nothing
03I actually knew about that app before
03but didn't know you could map it to search
03so yeah
03you long-press search and it just takes a screenshot with drocap
03my Droid 2 had it built in
10aScreenshot
10Just found that in the market
03that one sucks
03it didn't even work for my phone LOL
10Why?
03instead of screenshots
03so LOL
/me checks reviews
12phones should just have a Prt Scrn button
/me runs
03I wish
03Android screenshots are actually really complicated
03it basically has to clear the screen then re-draw everything on it
03only it draws it to a png instead of the screen
03or something
03not sure why, it's a bit obnoxious
Due to the security system
03that's still retarded
Normal apps cant touch eachother
Well DRF
12I just go on paint and redraw everything myself instead
03yeah but if fricking iPhones can have it built in
03so can Android
/me runs
ICS has it built in
:D
03does it?
03or is that just because you're using CM9
/me hides
03because CyanogenMod period has it built in
03:P
03CM7 has it built in on my Droid 2
03HML
03:P
Yes its built into ICS
Not just CM9
03seen any Motorolas with ICS yet?
03because IIRC
03the only ones that have ICS already
No clue
03are the brands that have built in screenshot regardless
03right?
Its built into the OS
03:P
Its built into AOSP
Srsly
03OK finally I got this to work
03http://i.imgur.com/Ju1wd.jpg
03any ideas?
BUDEW

03oh

03XXX is a common abbreviation for porn
03I'm surprised you didn't know that
10I don
10't watch porn
10Simple
03yeah but I'm surprised you hadn't heard the term o.o
Well Sky
10no
/me flees
when I think of XXX, I think of old cartoons where it was written on hillbilly booze bottles
10You're more interesti- I mean floof
03and apparently
6both definitions of it
03the name came from that beer company
03because
03X was a movie rating
03so they were forced to use 3
03LOL
6yep
6dos equis had it copyrighted
6yeh
03no idea?
03darn it
03I mean, I can't even figure out a word from those letters
03let alone the picture
03hmm, I could use one of those scrabble cheating sites
03where you punch in the letters and it makes words for you

hmm
6i need to get some teams together for PO
6sometime
I never had problems with resizing partitions
6possibly tonight
:p
04I need to use my Linoone more often though
12I made quite a few teams last night
eh I lost my team
12derpteam.tp NS?
12I can give it back to you

12ah
04The one she used that kept kicking my @$$

04Nightseas

hail teams are okay
6yep
04IT KICKS @$$
lol
6*snow clock
maybe i'm doing this training thing all wrong
04Why Toxic?
i should be doing singles to polish my skills at prediction
cus' Toxic is good

04Skarmory is a must then
6i'd never put glaceon out against a stell type unless forced to
7Hrm.
04holy crap Aggron has 180 base Defense

04we really don't care
04We're just like "lol"
I'm competitive but I don't really care that much
04Nope
04I've never used Aggron before
04NS
04I get my semi-competitiveness from you
/me 7is semi-competitive, mostly because of real-life tournaments. :P
04heh
04I only went srs because it's the only way to beat NS
04I could beat her for a time but now she destroys me
7Hmm.
6etc
6I'm not overly competitive because the whole system of competitive battling is just crap
04Aurora
04why do you think I use Toxicroak?
6same reason I use zweilous
Why do you think I use Weavile?
04Why do you think I use Linoone?
7Ninetales. :/
6k I'm not attacking people's opinions, good lord
exactly
<3
7So that's unfortunate. D:
04heh
04Aurora
6flareon can be legitimately useful
6apparently
04Yes
04it can
6I'd like to exploit that
7And also be able to teach Terrakion that move. :U
6a lot of effort, but yeah
12okay, got rid of Marill XD
04Nightseas
04use soemthing that can exploit the rain
7Rage? X3
12yeah, I'll be using Dry Skin
04Toxicroak is now a water-wall for my team
04Dry Skin + Thunderpunch
Dry Skin is horrible
7Pfft, NS. :P
7Dry Skin allows Jynx to stand up to Kyogre. XD
12yep
not using it
and besides
I like my team as it is
I've beaten legendary teams with it
04I want
7Uber-tier legendaries?

12^
12a Unown team!
04Nightseas
6rage can be a fun move
04it is quite possible
6it just sucks as a start
04to sweep a team of legendaries
04with Magikarp
6one day
04I want an Aron team as well
12flail?
7Aron. :D
7If only if it was usable in Infrared... D:
7)
04aww
7leveled*
7Fleebles.
<Drake> I want an Aron team as well
don't even go into that
7There are plenty of counters to it, though. X3
04like Magic Bounce
Most teams don't have counters for it
7You mean Guard?
04w/e
Magic Bounce doesn't counter it...?
Magic Bounce is only for status effects
04that one Alakazam had
04that NS used to stop it one time
7Yep, Magic Guard.
6magic guar
Yeah

6I had pretty awesome luck with zap cannon
04I loved Thunder's animation in GSC
lmao Zap Cannon
porygon-z
lock-on
ZAP AWAY
but that wastes a turn
7Whoo, 60 base damage per turn. X3
every time someone used it
IT KEPT HITTING ME
04XD
even though it has 50% accuracy
7Was it a Machamp?
6what sucks is attract
04GOD
04DAMN
04IT
04ATTRACT
7O.o
7At least genders can be set to avoid it.
6yeh
04problem:
04That's the problem
7?
04bullccrap it has 75% accuracy
04more like 90%
12alright
7Hey, same as Will-o-Wisp.
7What am I annoyed at in battles?
7Oh, yeah, random crits. :P

okay
7Not too bothersome.
hopefully not
6chill guys
6seriously.
Huh?
03...I smell smoke
03around here, that's not usually good
drffffffffffffffffffff
and not resizing its partition
03that's why
03you clean install
03for the 50th time
03what I do
03is
03parted magic
03make partitions to size
03then install Win7 to the NTFS partition I already made
03:P
I'm using gparted
03yheah same idea
03-
03*-h
03Parted Magic uses gparte
03d
derp
12fuuu-
downloading it atm
I went through 4 CDs yesterday
before I finally made a working copy of mint 12
04XD
03LOL CDs
04Toxicroak keeps sweeping you
04You need ice moves or something
12yep XD
03XBoot is like the single most useful thing I've discovered, ever
03:P
03but anything else
7Psychic.
6http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOqxUsnSA2c
12I was going to use Psychic on it, but Toxicroak was too fast
6that animation ohhhhhhmygoooooood
7I KNOW THAT ONE.
7It's on dA>
7Sorta.
6that is some beautiful animating
7Aye at the latter.

04cya
12seeya
03Lunch break at 6PM? LOL
12I probably do
12I probably do*
7Dusclops can hamper it with Will-o-Wisp.
04Nope
7Mmm'kay.
04Brick Break, X-Scissor, Thunderpunch and Sucker Punch
7No boosting move?
04No need. I use Toxicroak as a priority-abusing most of the time
7What does X-Scissor hit that Brick Break and Sucker Punch don't? o.o
7Grasses/
7?
04Thunderpunch/Brick Break/X-Scissor then Sucker Punch
04pretty much
04since it has a Focus Sash
7Okay.
7And why not Drain Punch over Brick Break?
7Unless you do like breaking screens. :P
04I have had bad experience with Reflect
04But wait
04Garchomp has Brick Break
7Garchomp? X3
04yah
03and then got weird
03and no it's not nsfw
04...
04OH
04Quan
12;3
04It can't learn Drain Punch
7 4th Gen tutor.
7Or TM.
7Dah.
04XD
04It can only learn Drain Punch via Breeding
04apparently
7And 4th gen. TM./
04And then Thunderpunch requires a 4Gen Tutor...
04wait
7Yeep.
04ah well
04Brick Break works
7If this is simulated battle, I don't suppose you can just make that modification.
04meh
04cbf
7Really? :U
04I'll live without it.
7Okay. :P
04It's not all that important
04I just wish
04Toxicroak could learn Close Combat
7Well, there's Cross Chop.
7Strongest it can get.
Cross Chop is pretty good
04>Breeding
04Plus it doesn't have 100 accuracy
04I'd rather not rely on luck
12Okay, I‚Äôm going to use a older team I revised now
04yeah well
04challenge NS
12alright
12NS :D
it has good enough accuracy
I don't have PO or a team
7Stone Edge, basically. :P
04ohright
04duh
/me facepalms
04Like I said
04RNG hates me
12derp
7Yep, but it's a standard.
04if I cared about standards I wouldn't even be using Toxicroak
7I suppose.
/me 7does. X.x
04XD
04Hell, I wouldn't be using Linoone
7My friend won a poster--that 'pokermon' image.
04XD
7So yeah. :P
THAT REMINDS ME
04?
7Which is why I'm less inclined for lolsome games. :/
7The physical games?
wat

How about
you just turn off UAC
go to cmd
and do all the ATRIB stuffs
:D
attrib /? yayish
I just did it via cmd
huh?
UAC?
oh
that thing
lol I failed to turn that off
Yes or No prompt
:p
yeah
/me goes to look for it
well
uh
where do you disable UAC?
/me too lazy to look
at the bottom
:p
The control panel's "small view' is sooo helpful
I lol'd
I tried setting the UAC thing to Never Notify
and then it comes up with a pop-up
03yeah
03which made you reboot
"Do you want to allow the following program to make changes to this computer?"
/me lol'd
...
03there's a perfectly good reason for it asking you
/me stabs
03LOL
03it hates you
03no but see
03UAC is basically the same as
03"restrict non-admins from doing this{"
03so on domains, e.g. my school
Yet
screw UAC
03it prevents students from turning off UAC
/me raeg
konboot?
whatever
I'm restarting anyway
03Ascendant
burning gparted
03it's a NETWORK PASSWORD
yeah I know
I was being sarcastic
not particularly
you bruteforce the network login
03LOL
03good luck with that
If only the LAN room wasn't locked with a digitpad
yeah I know
03social engineering.
03oh
then use all of them to bruteforce
as one botnet
???
the best botnet is when Mcaffe is installed
they secretly think it works
:p
lol mcaffee
I need to get spybot
or just get AVG
AVG is good for the simple things
03meh AVG
03get MBAM
LOLwut
I uninstalled norton
03EW NORTON
03EWWWWWWWWWWWW
exactly
03get MBAM"
:P
03for when she downloads porn
03that turns out to be viruses
Please do not swear. You have said a swear word 12 time(s).
03o.o
/me afks now
/me feels cold
my DET laptop has been online for 4days 18hrs 58mins 32secs

03NightSeas
03http://i.imgur.com/fGxbW.jpg
yeah I think I just deleted it
03you don't actually need that
03but
Good going
03Windows won't boot without it
:D
03but
._.
03you can install it without it
/me sighs
03it's really stupid and the reason I partition before installing
03but the disc also has that
03so yeah
I remembered the day
03just use gparted, delete the entire drive
I first did a clean install
03make NTFS partition
03profit?
12[20:00] <%drfsupercenter> http://i.imgur.com/fGxbW.jpg <-- LOL
how long
0330 mins
03roughly
More if you have a slow hdd
03yeah
0330-45
03it's much faster than XP though
03well
03mainly because of hte formatting
My laptop
well fine
hmm..
03XP is just as fast I suppose if you preformat
I'll completely reinstall 7
Good jorb NS you derp
whatever
Took like 2 hours with an OEM disl,
urgh
well
Less than 2 hours
No copypasta
03flash drive is faster
03if you have a 4+GB one
03that you can wipe
ORLY?!
03yes
03yeah
blah
I have 2 unallocated partitions
how2merge?
03sigh
03Ascendant
03just
03DELETE EVERYTHING
03and start over
03:)
fiiiine
But DRF
;_;
She'll loose NORTON!!!
Files
;P
03LOL
03*losew
03-w
03not loose
03loose is an adjective
03:|
03you haven't downloaded it yet? o.o
it's 3GB
03I thought you said you had it o.o
it's STILL COPYING
03why copy
03just move
03o.o
same time though
12derp. been busy with school work all day .-.
03not realy
orly?
03copying actually creates a copy
03derp
03Yes.
03at least it SHOULd be
oh
03LOL how did you not know that
03if it's on the same drive
03it's only when you move between drives that it takes just as long
03then ext3 or whatever it is sucks horribly
On all sane file systems it should be
well it's done now
03exactly
Are you on the forums?
03and FAT32, too
Fat16 can die
Sloowly
for example on ext3/4 it wont actually move anything, just update where the file is
FAT32 is a PoS
03well
03as LOL UNIVERSALL COMPATIBLE
03NTFS can cause issues
NTFS is a pretty crappy filesystem
03um
03it's not public_html
03it has to be in var/www
03and you need sudo to move it
-_-
03this
03is why
oh yeah apache
At least we have decent file restore programs
;-;
Why are you not in the www-data group?
03I have no idea
03LOL
ext have good file recovery programs
03never seen one, never heard of one working o.o
03GetDataBack for NTFS is like the single best thing ever made
this
HFS+ best filesystem evah :D
downloading at 1mbps
Then whoever was using the ext recovery program was a derp
Waitasec
if Ext only updates the position of the file instead of moving the data
03LOL
03so
03I noticed the weirdest thing ever
03that's really bugging me
03you know that seagate that broke and had a couple files I needed on it?
Yeaah
:P
Did it break the recovery program?
03Yep
03OK like'
03ever heard of SpinRite?
If the data is on a bad sector, its screwed anyway
03well
03here's the thing
03attempt to recover it
12yep /late
03and go "nope, sorry, can't fix it"
03on this drive
03it literally STOPS
03it just, full stop
Bada** drive :<
03hits about 48% and just stops the stupid thing
03but
03it's supposedly still reading data
Then the drive is totally screwed
03but if you look at the live snapshot of data being read
03after about a day
03it got another 1% done
03LOL
03is why does it literally stop the programs
well it would be good to have more here
03rather then them go "Uh, can't read this, bad sector!"
I remember when that happened
03same thing happens with scandisk, even the fast one
but I think the harder part is keeping them here
03it'll get to about 48% and just STOP
to an old ATA/IDE maxtor drive
03since scandisk had it "locked"
12true
:p
03well
03I might try to run DBAN, but only after I'm 100% sure I can't get my crap back :/
03because right now, SpinRite *is* still going, just very very very very very slowly
03like LOL taking an entire week for one drive
Hm
Sleep time
Night

I remember in 2008 when flatscreen TVs weren't flat.
/me stabs MicroSD cards
03these files are copying at like 8MB/sec
03usually the *read* speeds are really good
Whoa
03and it's the *write* speed that's slow
03yay taking close to an hour >_>
My silly cards usually like
actually
03to copy the contents of my old phone's MicroSD to my computer
er
03good
03but it's also 32GB
I'm getting like 7.5MB/S write speed using chkflash
not very many options XD
03yeah but
03I'm talking about *read* speed
03not write speed
03read speed is usually much faster
03I'm copying actual fiels LOL
03*files
03http://graphjam.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/funny-graphs-probably-the-first-person-to-lose-a-limb-with-one-too.jpg <- if ony
03*only
7.8 MB/S write
03that's
03as technically
03it only needs to be 6MB/sec
03well yeah
But yeah
03even solid states
03hence
03I just winrar them LOL
Getting an average of 7.4-7.8

ooh
16.4 MB/S read speed
decent little thing
03nice
03that's twice as fast as mine's going x.x
go use chkflsh
and see how it compares :<

10Caribbeans

12I figured out how to DDOS for fun today. (I didn‚Äôt do anything btw) XD
03see
03I don't even know how to DDOS
03I don't *want* to know
03because some people just assume that I'm some pro hacker because I'm good at computers
12I just wanted to know for some reason
03so not knowing how to is the best defense XC
03*XD
Be a genius
and DDOS 127.0.0.1 and 192.168.1.1 plz
:>
12I'm already a genius >:@

Hi
I am back
:D
03well
12derp
03they had a fricking cop
03and the principal
12XD
03and the director of IT for the school district
ohmy
03they're like
;-;
U gonna get slammed?>
03"SO there's a rumor going around that a group ofp eople hacked everybody's password and had a 'master list' somewhere. Do you know anything about this?"
03I was like um, no
03as I honestly hadn't
03and they were like "well, 4 separate people told us you might know who's responsible"
03I'm like ...
03Just because I gave them a way to bypass the filter
03does not know I know how tos teal password
03*mean
03-_-
12LOL
03I was in there for like an hour
03being questioned
03have you ever done this, this, this
03"Look, honestly, I'm all talk. I have no idea how to "hack" anything. The worst I've done is just bypass the filter a few time"
03*s
03and he's like "well that's good, you don't want to go that route"
03I was like "oh, I know, I'm ethical"
03even if it's just repayment or a thank-you donation
If that happened to me
03I don't care, I won't take it
um
03hi
I would just say "I dislike censorship and I prefer to increase my productivity by using my own methods of work!"
03NightSeas that's my point
hi?
03I just found the
03m
03ever heard of Peacefire?
12nope
03they usually use two ordinary words
12ah
03or something
03and just make it .com
03anyway, the thing is
03you go to one of the peacefire proxies
03there's a form at the bottom to sign up for their mailing list
03:P
03that's basically all I did LOL
12XD
03<HyperMetalLugia> I would just say "I dislike censorship and I prefer to increase my productivity by using my own methods of work!"
03I didn't finish
03after the cop left
03I'm like "Um, no? It's as if someone just took the master list and blocked them all without actually hand-checking the sites, which is stupid and lots of legitimate sites were blocked that souldn't have been"
03I go "Oh really then? Then why is my own personal server with nothing bad on it blocked for porn?"
03dead silence for about a minute
03then he goes "Thanks for talking, you're free to go"
ouch.
You trolled him good
:D
03Yep
03to this day I have never heard from them again :P
03they were all
03I was like w/e
03nope, never heard from them
03:P
03Get this
03Earlier today, Iw as freaking out because my password didn't work, I thought I had been banned or something (from the university PCs)
03then I was like "derp, they forced me to change my password, that's right"
12I hate forced passwork changes XD
03yeah
03but
03I found a way around it
12password*
03*s
03OK fine, challenge accepted
03so I change it to
03temp1
03temp2
03temp3
03etc
03then change it back
03:P
12LOL
Good idea
:o
;<
03what I fricking hate
03>must be at least 8 characters
03My usual password is 7
03RAGE
12my usual password is 12
03well mine's 7 LOL
03I want to figure out if there's a way to get around the thing
03maybe using a VPN
10 for me
03Since it had that issue before
03HML you might like this
I AM THE MIDDLE PERCENT
03our school is odd
03and has two passwords
/me runs
03well
03both of them were set to some stupid pasword originally
03Windows is easy to change, it's like 8 characters or more, that's all
03well the other one
03I log into my email
03go to change it
03I'm like >:@
Returrded
03I go in there
ew.
03do passwd
03and change it
03to my usual "unsafe" passweord
03-e
12EW symbols in passwords
:<
03it didn't whine
03:P
03so I now have a gmail password
03that is only 7 chars long
03umad?
03gmail requires 8+
03but I'm special
127? All my passwords are even numbers XD
12like 6, 10 and 12
03it's 7.
03Don't ask why
03I've had that password since second grade
03:P
12XD
12I've had mine since 4th grade
/me hides
INB4 His password is DanielF
/me dies
I've never had a set password though
Every single school used a different password.
03-_-
03anyway though
03the reason I was able to get away with it
03is that the school migrated to gmail after I had already set the password on their Java email system
03and it just copied the apsswords over
03:P
12my password is derpherphurr
/me hides
I keep a text file of all my passwords
Or should I say
My previous passwords
12I bet if it was something suggestive no one would be able to guess :D
/me runs
12and that's only if it's a password to server,etc
03yeah exactly
03I try to use my same password everywhere
03I know that's supposedly unsafe
03but it's not like anybody actually nkows it
03*kjnows
03-j
12and it's also not like anyone knows everywhere you've been XD
03well
03on any site it's registered
03:P
03except AIM for some reason.
03AIM wouldn't let me use that name
;o
maybe you afren't the deal DRF
03um
03as in
03I could just figure it out

bleh
I still need to create a pagefile blah partition
fml
03Windows doesn't need that :P
03then yeah
which requires deleting everything to upgrade
03I still think you should just virtualize it

03that's retarded
well mint is retarded in that
03I managed to do ubnutu fine
03*ubuntu
ubuntu != mint
03I know
it's some dodgy crap
03Ubuntu used to be good
03not anymore

03you can't just point it to an ext3 partition? o.o
yeah
bleh
03*VMWare
03as I swear
03it should run FINE on that system
Yes
It lags

03did you give it really crappy specs?
03give it like 2 gigs of RAM
which I could do
03that's even more laggy

03my laptop basically never crashes
03yeah but
I didn't say that

Ethernet controller, network controller, PCI Device, etc.
SM Bus Controll

1212Once they gave a housewife the same penalty as him for downloading a few songs LOL
02what?
It is stupid
1212yep.
this is why Sweden <3
1212they charged her $150,000 for every song she downloaded

150000?
that's retarded

02what? 150k? how many did she downloaded?
121220
02.....
023 million?
1212almost, it was like 18 or 19 songs
1212Sweeden is awesome

sorry for spamming
Well yeh
didn't realise it was all newline
Anything thats compiled against openssl1
always newline.
yeah
that's gonna total around 500 packages
and I need openssl 0.9.8
or at least something that's not 1
/me checks sshpass's syntax
and how about you install 0.9.8 from source in a different location and then build sshpass to use that?
Let's see if I can-
yeah I was thinking about that
debian is good though ):
Arch <3
debian <3
Have you checked is theres a newer version of sshpass
pretty sure this is the newest
Mint <3 </troll>
$ sshpass -V
sshpass 1.04 (C) 2006-2008 Lingnu Open Source Consulting Ltd.
I used Mint 9 for 2 years
only starting to use Mint 12 now
heh
because upgrading mint sucks
Did it get worse?
hm
I think I'm going to have to recompile sshpass
Good luck and have fun
Whyyyyyyy recompiling ;-;
aaaand it's still extracting
I should get a Pentium 1 system
and recompile everything
workarounds
try get gentoo and do it
:{D

seriously
Soo
Some programs are compile only?
huh?
Well
I mean, source only, nothing is precompiled?
blah, brbs
finally

let's get sshpass working
=P
$ sshpass -V

oh it's /usr/local/in
wtf
bin*
mhhm
okay wtf
why is it STILL not working
I know it's not an issue with my bash script
because it has worked in the past
02bash script?
don't worry
Wut
idk
sshpass being a PITA
Did it wor?
it's working with sftp
but not ssh
seems to be a sshclient issue

I hope they didn't make it worse x.x
6if they did, they're liable
6so yeah
hmm
I should be fine to drive an hour on the freeway back to school?
after I fill up the gas that is
6should be
alright
6like I said, the light goes on for a lot of things
well yeah
6but it's likely it's something simple
6like my van's light was on for 8 months
but it's a 12 year old vehicle
6turns out it was a couple tubes that had holes in them
it might just die LOL
6the van is actually 11 years old lol...
well
6cars shouldn't just die at 12 years old
don't you generally want to get it looked at asap?
6whats the mileage and how well do you guys keep it?
/me runs
6well yeah drf
ug
*uh
6but ASAP doesn't literally mean DROP EVERYTHING, SHOP NOW
6not unless something is bad
6...
6only 120? O_o
yes
6god that thing should be fine for a while
6true
6but still
6it /should/ be fine for a while longer
6jag?
07jaguar
07it was my mom's
6oh

if a mouse is "USB Only"
i hate crosswords
for older computers
k
well
with Win98/Me
but not mouse
No clue
o.i
*o
most of these don't have them
Not really
k
DDR4 RAm
:D
hm
never heard of them
the other brands are Crucial and PNY
Kingston is too expensive
12o.o
I always like OCZ tbh
don't see any
hm
:>
here's Patriot
There fine
no wait
that's laptop ra,
I need desktop
Just go for timing
these don't say
07I have patriot desktop ram
K
well
Yeh, if it doesnt tell you the timings its probs crap
this is DDR2 which is getting harder to find
07mainly cuz they were on sale when I went to Fry's lol
well the lylzy thing
*lulzy
a 4GB 'kit'
as in, 2x2GB
is $60
a single 2GB
Have a soldering gun
is $27
;D
LOL
figure that out
Uhh
No clues
LOL
07well
yea right
27*2= 60-6
:O
07are they dual channel
RAM memory is SMD/SMT
plus ultra sensitive to static electricity
um
aren't all DDR2 dual channel?
uh well
07not if you don't buy them as pairs
..
but I'm buying 2
As long as you have sets it works
But non matched sticks work fine
tell that to my laptop
well
this has CAS latency 5
I just looked it up
that's fine, right?
DDR2 800
heck, I should get 4
since
the 2x2GB I have
are diff brands
>_>
12brb
How did you do that?
Well
make sure the timings are the same
07just pairs of two
I pulled them from a PRE BUILT COMPUTER
LOL WOW
and it had 2 different brands
odd, right?
yep
yeah
may
...
oh
one of them broke
07but all 4 speeds should be the same
You should match timings and latency etc, voltages etc
yeah
ill just buy 4 identical sticks
that'll work for sure :P
07why are you building something outdated in the first place lol
I'm upgrading it, rather
and because I can
:P
LOL wow
it's a pretty legit HTPC case
I like it :P
I suck
also micro center is stupid sometimes
"patriot desktop memory"
Though, I haven't seen any problems yet
>picture is laptop memory
LOL
>actual item is laptop memory
-_

...fail
:<
2 2GB sticks is $60
oh
AND that's CL6, the singles are 5
that's stupid
DRF
Opposite here
buying 4 singles :P
07link?
The singles are more expensive

12I like XP.
06XP was awesome
XP sucks now

03o_O
06nah
06not gonna try
XP was awesome
Yeah
*was*
now it's not :D
12Windows 8's pre-beta is apparently available for download now
12XP FTW.
06i still like it
Vista is harder to run then 7
03XP is fine but if it's a "new" laptop...
And if it is a half decent laptop, XP might run worse
06hm
062.5GB RAM
that's more than enough
my laptop runs 7 fine with 8GB
/me hides

I don't want to have a 64bit OS

what's wrong with 64-bit OSes?
I can't play 16bit games

probably...
04Bulbapedia only shows 4 times, but it doesn't say "Stop challenging you"
12See, I've never tried to do that XD
04Just shows their team changes
> Customised
> Effort
I want to run it without dealing with different layers of emulation
Not to mention it's pointless for me on here as this thing doesn't have more than 4GB currently

Assassin's Creed
Keeps crashing
it freezes and crashes on the second tutorial part
drfffffffffffffff
03hi
;____;
12hi
03well
03that's probably why
I actually didn't even install it properly because the stupid thing wouldn't install
eeeeeeeeeeeeh
03um
03yeah that's probably why
Well
It should work
Even though I haven't installed it fully
03I can help
/me runs
lmao
03OK seriously
That would be nice
):
03if it has an installer, use it
it has an installer
03well
I tried usingit
it got stuck on some random .forge file
03that you ./ ?
.bin files?
they still require the dependencies to be met
03LOL DEPENDENCIES
03yeah
03MOST of the time
yeah
03(which are basically dependencies)
03Linux is like "LOL GO DO IT YOURSELF"
03eh, I've had a lot of problems
well linux's package manager
03well
03the ons I've seen
03will go "Oh, you already have .NET framework, OK then"
03not like "let's just install another copy"
03but if you don't have it, it'll install it
is on ubuntu/debian/mint
03VMWare Tools
03I mean
03that too
.net framework is diff
03it just magically works
03xD
and you need the newer one
03but you have to chmod +x and ./ it
and then you need to install about 100 different .deb files from the damn debian site
12This is depressing http://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/2012/3/21/2d9a1daf-f1f6-4703-ab80-7c0c18e54e79.jpg
12whoa.
I had to do that once
it sucked
and in the end it didn't even work
03Good MMO is like
03an oxymoron
03:)
03but uh, I have like

03wait
/me checks again
03hm,
03the 60 day thing is separate
I'm not in the US
XD
03but you'd have to get the service
03as the US one prolly wouldn't work anyway
03yeah
Yeah probs
Doesn't matter, I was kinda joking anyway XD
03since it's usually the same price in $ as ¬Ä

AI must take less cpu then online junl
junk
03probably
04?
03I don't think it was the CPU
03but the graphics
03the demo is only two parts of one level
03so maybe the other levels needed more power
03I know LL's laptop could run the "normal" levels, but for Cold Stream it crapped out and froze
03but EW ONBOARD GRAPHICS
03on *any* computer, desktop or laptop
03:(
lmao
03I buy my crap with no onboard chips
mine isn't onboard graphics
03if possible
03well
I think
03yours is hybrid
03onboard/dedicated
yeah
03AMD mobile does that
03but
03for somer eason
03uses the onboard for *Everything*
03I had to manually add crap to the list to use dedicated
._.
03and just added IE and Skype as that's all she uses
lmao
03but eh
XD
03she'd be fine with some $200 Acer crap
03She's like "you're a computer person, just find me a laptop"
03it was the only 15" with a numpad
03EW LAPTOPS WITH NO NUMPADS
ew numpads
03no numpads
03I actually use the numpad quite a bit
the one I have now has a numpad
I hate it
03I hate you
03I mean
03hence why I went for a 15" screen and not 13-24
03*14
03I'd be fine with a 13-14" laptop but meh, I want a numpad
lmao
I should be writing my essay
not playing games
03Um, if I didnt'set up a connection, HOW
lmao
xp uses magic
03yeah
it hacks into the nearest network by itself
03it just does it in the background
yeah
lmao
03I have a working crack though
03for XP
03works on any service pack/version, never had probs
There's lots of working keys for XP
03well;
03keys != activation
03for example
03"works"
03unless you abuse their phone system
03:P
03with XP, I'm lazy and just run a batch file
03to do it
you abused their phone system rather quickly
03yeah
03because I've done it a lot
