Kandarihu: Everyone know iPAD evolved to Skynet
Bronysith: oh God that

Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: well, I don't think police in 1980's would have access to a M16
this design is a failure
Pintos had such an EXPLOSIVE appeal though.
Why would you not want one?
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: isn't M16 a military weapon first and foremost?

CrazyHippie: works off of the multiple futures scenario, think of a stream with divergent branches in it and he came from one and Sarah went down another but further on they ALL meet at the same one.
11,01I like the dust channel.

SHIT!

Terminator.
So let me get this straight. Skynet loses, and by losing it tries to win, and by trying to win it creates not only itself, but its own mortal enemy.
otakon: have you seen this movie yet?
Bronysith: I've seen most of it
:(
and then the script glitched

Inb4 it keeps going.
seems legit

I hope that Terminator doesnt have a Sandvich
otakon: The future wouldnt change because going back to the past means they already changed the future which they are from. Nothing changes
Bronysith: thank you?
otakon: look at it
00,10well it always was around hen3ry, it just changes how it came to be.
the front page says 8 zombie proof homes you can buy

Dat Dirty Rarity.
Dogs?
Bronysith: zombie proof homes
Phase4: oh sorry

A bakery? -lol
Goodnight guys
otakon: thats weird, i thought i had heard ever song he had ever made

Night AlienWarhead

Weird Al got two cameos on the Aquabats
Clear your throats and GOOD LUCK!

automatic circumcisers...

11,01Big_Macintosh_1992: Be careful, or you'll be kicked by the spam filter.
it's a pretty good series on Video Games on Youtube.
Jspang1 actually yes
Sumica: i can do it in gordon freemans voice

You know it's true: http://cheezburger.com/6338391040
All right then
automatic circumsizers....
YEAH! made it about 86% Improvement!
He refuses to sing this song live due to that part alone
I can't even exhale that long, much less make my lips and tongue flap that fast :/
Nittany_Discord: what did i do?
TTGL makes it up to about 4th strongest
00,10I can also turn invisable if no one looks at me.
11,01Nothing.

And 4th? What's above that? I shudder to ask...
Nittany_Discord: then why would i get kicked?
StinkomanFan: What? He sings that part in live performance O.o
Bronysith: It's funny because he doesn't speak! Ohhohohoho... yes!

WTF?
@.@
O_O
Huh...?
ha
this FTW
WTF
00,02XD
best video
wtf is this
BRONY_4_LIFE: also known as ponysanas, but those ponys specifically describe the creator
-_(\
WTF?
00,02SuperBrony64, try 0.7 speed?
Thanks foooorrrrr sssssttttrrrreeeeaaaaammmmiiiinnnnggggg
what the fuck.. is..
brohoof? /)
1.2 spead!
And now we hear it at normal speed
hahahahahahahahha
SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE!
(\
SuperBrony64: go 4x fast
FlutterguyAndRainbow I stear clear of as many ship-fics as possible. Despite this, I'm writing a fan-fic with a Romance element
hahahahahahahahahahahahha
I WANT TO PLAY THIS ON THE PIANO
YAY
weeee
Stop torturing me! D:
all the squeaks
"honey kill the mouse!"
what the fuck...
oh its over
FlutterguyAndRainbow Tactical Mute!
It's at Ludicrous Speed
i would write a fanfic but i woldent be able to get caraters right
Now play it backwards!
This is hurting my head..........
All the spining.......
*get's headache8
Are they going left but spinning right? What its happening?
BRONY_4_LIFE: you would have a better chance at drawing. even if you aren't any good. there are SO MANY fan-fics. yours would never get read. i'm sorry
brony_4_life for the love of god, before you write everthing, watch all the episodes
BRONY_4_LIFE that is one of the biggest issues of fan-fics: de-characterization. I see it too often, especially in Human in Equestria stories
HiE for short
One of these days guys. I'll show me IRL :p
Please. Please play shed.mov
Oh i know what that song is bottle of beer song
How is that spin even correct?
Lol
and this is how equestria was made?
Please play shed.mov
LOL
FlutterguyAndRainbow: nooo
so anyway is ep 4 at the grand galaping gala
You must be new
They will never play anything .MOV related. They already mentioned that >.>
BRONY_4_LIFE: nope. its the season finale for some weird reason
BRONY_4_LIFE: episode 26 is at the galloping gala. it's the season 1 finale
FlutterguyAndRainbow says the one asking for a .MOV :p
BRONY_4_LIFE nnope. The Grand Galloping Gala is the season finale. Ep4 is Applebuck Season
why did writers make the ticket episode even if it wasnt close to the finale o_o
hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT
oh god....
Alright time to go to youtube get scared shittless and never sleep again! Bye guys!
bye
ah cool an applejack ep im gessing
bye FlutterguyAndRainbow
00,02FlutterguyAndRainbow, have fun
BRONY_4_LIFE: yus. have you not watched them?
My Fluttershy SHED.MOV voice is awesome! :d
11,02La la la la la~
Bye FlutterguyAndRainbow

hey hey hey stay out of my shed
la la la la la la la la
BRONY_4_LIFE eeyup. AND is has Big Macintosh say more than "Eeyup". He actually has quiete a few lines
/me Sniffs self
I smell awful :s
I really don't want to watch this. But I must. ITS MY BRONY RITUAL!
That was before Big Mac got Flanderized to a one word sentence speaker.
Lunar_Brony: ponyville confidential
Ponies47 I'm worse.
BRB. Shower :P
/me thinks about day
i'm irresponsible
and obsessed with ponies
KernelCobb that is the episode where the CMC write for the school newspaper, but go too far with their stories
so what is appleblooms cutemark
None
404 Cutie Mark Not Found
Lunar_Brony: exactly, but my point is Big M's speaking role in that episode
Ok so whats next?
BRONY_4_LIFE she doesn't have one yet
streaming person: smile-isode plz
KernelCobb oh, right. And Hearts and Hooves Day.
?
they arnt born with tem ?
Getting bored of Space. Wanna go to Earth.
11,02Have to go now actually and help out with something.
28 seconds into shed.mov..... Laughing my ass off
Lunar_Brony: yus, but he was under a love poison
11,02Thanks for tuning in, I'll stream later if I have time and am awake :3
BRONY_4_LIFE nnope. They earn their cutie marks when they find their special talent
00,02BRONY_4_LIFE, you watched the show?
Thanks for streaming SuperBrony64 :D
Hey im sorry that i send the link when i said oops about few minutes ago everypony
goodnight SuperBrony64!
00,02later SuperBrony64
KernelCobb he still had lines beside "Eeeyup" and "Nnope"
iv only watched a few epersoieds
Lunar_Brony: but they were more "shmoozie woozie cutie wutie pumpkin pah"
Well if you guys get lazy you could always just run all 3 and a half hours of Bronypalooza
bye SuperBrony64
So bro hoofs
Brony 4 life .. only watched 3 eps... Logic :p
Discord is best pony
ok brony4life please, watch at least half of the episodes before you come on here, trust me. i watched 7 episdoes and i had no questions
brb, have to blow up air matress :S
bai SuperBrony64|AFK thx
KernelCobb dont remind me, I'm suffering from Overdose of Fresca
dinky: don't send him away just because he is new
As soon as you see Spike smoking a joint you know its gonna be funny
I'm not sending him away, I
FlutterguyAndRainbow: have you seen party.mov yet?
not yet
I'm telling him that it gives a LOT of knowlage to watch just a few episodes
BRONY_4_LIFE you can stay for as long as you like, no matter how many episodes you've watched
Hey does anypony want to show some stuff for the paint program stuff?
my sister tells me to stay away from .mov's I don't understand why
FlutterguyAndRainbow: well if you like spike smoking a joint, you better piss before you watch that
ive seen the first 3 ep and a lot of fanficton
FlutterguyAndRainbow they're not what you might think
Btw a good episode to watch just for understanding crap would be the final episode
FlutterguyandRainbow, have you also read Jappleack (Made by the same guy)?
Oh god fanfiction... That is gona make you think stuff is cannon when it's not
dinky s1 or s2? There were 2 finales
dinky: no way, that ruins everything. he would have missed discord, party of one, everything
BRONY_4_LIFE: i say watch them all in order
No, watch them in Haruhi order.
Now fluttershy's shed is starting to scare me
hen3ry: ?
......
i mean season 2, and i know he's gona watch all of them, i'm just saying that s agood one to make you understand it more
BRONY_4_LIFE be EXTREMELY CAREFUL around Fan-fiction. Some of the stuff is just downright disturbing
Hey cupcakes was allright
anime ref, KernelCobb
hen3ry: that's why i didn't understand it
a series that had two different orders - actual chronological order was very different from broadcast order.
20 minutes left on the download, then i can go to sleep
and the two main characters argued over which episode was "next"
*sees dead bunny corpses on the walls* Oh my god! Look at all this porn! *picks up playboy*
that's weird
dinky if I can barely get through Rainbow Factory, I will never be able to read Cupcakes
*shrug* anime.
I remember the first time everyone "STAY OUT OF MY SHED" spammed in here. In the Rainbow Dash room Wrek had to +m to get everyone to stop
FlutterguyAndRainbow: look closer at the magazine
playpony
um its playpony
I love rainbowdashes reactions anyway
haha new guy knows
luv ya, new guy
???
ok ok
luv you too FlutterguyAndRainbow
I'm not new to mlp I'm just new to .movs
new didn't refer to you
/me listens to some Metroid Prime music with his headphones.
aw jeese...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sNPKg0gkmc&list=FLSA2Xsus9vC2Gx61qBgNP9A&index=12&feature=plpp_video
Lunar_Brony, Cupcakes is just gory
CrimsonPhoenix: try sweet apple massacre
Fluttershy has the chainsaw. Need I watch more?
it'll scar you
shockfics just don't do anything for me.
KernelCobb, I wanted to one day
Gore has no purpose without a reason for it
in stories
but alas I'm in no mood for fanfic
Shizuka.... thank you ^-^
CrimsonPhoenix: i say do it, but deep down i don't ever want you to
13<3333
Lunar_Brony: who are you quoting?
KernelCobb, I know the basic idea though
Shizuka do you think she'll like it?
and I've read rainbow factory
Yeah the mods must be asleep right now. During the first airing of Putting Your Hoof Down they didn't want people even saying "Stay out of my shed"
I loved it
CrimsonPhoenix: written to be the most insulting brony fan-fic EVER
rainbow factory is good
but hated cupcakes
KernelCobb no one. I made that up right no
and not as bad as people made it out to be
*now
It's not bad
KernelCobb, oooooooh
Lunar_Brony: nah, i've heard someone say it before.
FlUtEr's squeel is quite tame
It's THAT kind of fanfic
Lunar_Brony: maybe you are intentionally original, but late at it
OMG I love pinkie pie at the end of it
CrimsonPhoenix: what are you referring to with "It's"?
i mean which one is "that kind of fanfic"?
My daddy makes me put glass in my ******
the fanfic of course
CrimsonPhoenix the Rainbow Factory turns Rainbow Dash into a mentally unstable shell of herself with one intention: anhilation of a certain pegasus that failed her
sweet apple massicre?
Lunar_Brony, yes and?
that is just wong
CrimsonPhoenix oh, did you read it?
Finished shed.mov now to party.mov
Lunar_Brony, I did
sweet appal massacure is wrong
and I loved it
BRONY_4_LIFE: watch the eps first, bro. ignore fanfic until then
DON'T GO NEAR sweet apple massacre
DO NOT
FlutterguyandRainbow, if you liked that .mov, be sure to read Ask Jappleack (a webcomic made by the same guy who does the .movs) It's got a good story and it also ties into the .mov story. It's been announced the final .mov will also end the Jappleack comic story.
KernelCobb, it's like badly written?
CrimsonPhoenix it is a good fic, but . . . http://www.redbubble.com/people/stinkehund/works/7383789-i-have-a-crush-on-rainbow-dash-with-text?p=t-shirt
or is it like way too OOC?
BACK FROM MAH SHOWER! :p
CrimsonPhoenix: do you watch southpark?
wb Ponies47
its to late :'(:'(:'(
just answer yes or no
Somewhat
anyone who wears that shirt, will get eaten by warewoves
not a huge fan but I enjoy some episode here and there
MahBoi777: Thanks mate :3
hi Ponies47. We're having a conversation about fan-fics, specifically the gore
dinky why?
CrimsonPhoenix: did you see the episode where the boys try to write the most vulgar disturbing book ever?
so any pony wanna play day z togehter?
nope
well that's what they did
have you read awoken
now take that same intention, and put it with ponies
so it's just disturbing.
CrimsonPhoenix: there is a seen where big mac rapes sweetie belle's horn with his ass I SAY NO MORE
Oh my~
wat
dem showers
why did chat stop? make my message go away D:
KernelCobb, that just intrigued me more than anything
...
when i read rainbow factory i was like no they killed scootaloo but then i was like who is scootaloo
Lunar_Brony: What? *Eye twitchs* You mean horror fics? *Ear twitchs* It's all coming back to me! NO NO don't do that to Rainbow Dash Twilight! NO! no no no! AHHHHHHH! *Curls up into a ball and starts sucking hoof*
I hate this fandom sometimes.
CrimsonPhoenix: i haven't read it. don't
xD
13Okay.
13Enough.
13You all know the rules.
13Discussion of fics like that ends here.
thankyou
ok Shizuka
There we go
Please
Yes please Shizuka
thank you so much
We went quite overboard there I do admit.
So how about that assassin's creed movie, guys?
Wonder where you guys went to
KernelCobb wut?
we need sum sea ponies to calm us down :$
o-o
http://youtu.be/Hnqz9OdZjRQ
No no no no no
I just missed everything that happened.
Lunar_Brony: not 100% sure, but i heard a rumor. look it up for the both of us
What happened?
Rarity is being held captive by mexicans?
SparklyWaffles: you have a scroll bar
Not the sea ponies
How weird does this get?

KernelCobb: Yes. Yes I do. And I shall use it.

Ponies47 pong
MahBoi777 Silly filly, I am Mr. Chair!
WHO PINGED ME! D:
Ponies47 you did!
XD
Hate. Let me tell you how much I've come to hate you since I began to live. There are 387.44 million miles of printed circuits in wafer thin layers that fill my complex.
Biglaw: sorry Mr. Chair, I need a place to sit
Do I have to patch up the chat with Ductape again?
MahBoi777 Do you want to meet the bro?
So whats happening? I'm still tired and sleepy, can't follow the fast moving chat.
I need to know. who pinged me? D:
If the word 'hate' was engraved on each nanoangstrom of those hundreds of millions of miles, it would not equal one one billionth of the hate I feel for humans at this micro instant.
For YOU. Hate. HATE.
pings...
?
Biglaw: Bro?
i didnt ping
:3
FairysHuff a Sonic Rainboom occurred, Biglaw is a chair, and Ponies47 can't figure out who pinged him.
need I say more?
MahBoi777: Did you ping me before?
i ponyed my facebook https://www.facebook.com/Ponyhoof?sk=app_297480083634544
Canadian_Brony The usual then. ^_^ Thankyou
Ponies47: I think it was MahBoi777.
MUFFINS!!

MahBoi777: Can you repeat?

MahBoi777: http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyzhckVSK31r1e4aqo1_400.jpg
Well I'll just be floating about here. Let me know when the chat stops having a seizure of word vomit ^_^
i had a chance to go to kings island but i have been there too many times and denied so my parents just went (and this decission was made today) i regret it now

Ponies47: OOH you should ride the one called The Titan if they still have it. >:]
I have never hear of ponyhoof
Ponies47: it ponifies ur facebook
i personally prefer unicorns...
MahBoi777: No the Six Flags in Illinois doesn't. They have this one called Raging Bull. It's awesome :3
Biglaw: :O
Ponies47: well have fun!
MahBoi777 I'm sure the barrel you be happy to be sat on

/me has a heartattack
the only thing i have been on was a caboose being pulled by a old steem engine
MahBoi777: I will. X-Flight is one of my favorites. You go upside down 5 times it makes you feal like your on the wings of a airplane :3
Ponies47 SHUT UP AND TAKE MY BITS!!
Canadian_Brony: Ok then :3
Ponies47 . . . /)_(\

this is what I'm listening to: http://www.listenonrepeat.com/watch/?v=PLjpTtxH4Jo
guys i have the goodest link you guys have to watch this
xxMoopyxx "Goodest" isnt' a work
*word
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgKIfA8G6OQ&feature=player_detailpage
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45RTzZdsJTE Derpy Song sad but nice
watch it
i think my dad is ashamed of me
http://derpy.me/q0maT
he thinks im a screw up
Well that sucks! Ponyhoof can't be installed with Internet Explorer! D:
and gay 4 watching mlp
Ponies47 buck that! I'm using Firefoz
*Firefox
wht ponyhoof
could be worse. could be sparkly vampires. xD
use Google Chrome :$
im using aurora
I HATE GOOGLE CHROME! :[
thegt90 Aurora . . . *shudders* (not the browser)
Ponies47: why? :(
I have a secret game that I'd like to play. It's a very nice game. Oh, it's a lovely game, a game of fun and a game of adventure!
hi Kammerjunk
Oh, I've been here a while.
its nice browser actually
I just forgot that I had to sleep.
thegt90 we were all told not to talk about what I think of when I hear "Aurora"
wht game
Ponies47: works fine for me ._.
no its my browsers name its made by the same people who made firefox i also have nightly as well
The only browser I hate is IE.
Am I killing the chat again?
Ponies47: yup :$
And even IE serves its purpose.
i hate IE
I mean, IE -is- the single best browser
...for downloading a new browser.
^
:D
ie is best when it actually works
Canadian pony thanks for that song. It was one of the few that I haven't downloaded yet
Kammerjunk eeyup
First thing to do with ie is download chrome
thegt90 IE works?
can anypony streem somthing
yeah for killing my computer
BRONY_4_LIFE no, just mods
aww
I use Firefox. Mainly because I can't be arsed to learn the ins and outs of a new browser system and then setting it up to work like I want it to and downloading the add-ons I like.
Ponies47: just wait, Applebloom XD
firefox memory leaks turned me off.
Canadian Pony thanks for that stream. It was one of the few songs I haven't downloaded yet
"a new browser system"? This is the kind of thing I say when I haven't slept.
try nigtly its the same thing and it updates every night
hen3ry: That's the least of my concerns. My problem is Firefox not liking having over 130 tabs open.
wait is ur operating system 64bit
Bookmarks are for the weak.
Ponies47: you will get it when it comes, Applebloom :P
Kammerjunk I use Firefox because I've been using it for over 10 years because my father despises IE, and so do I
Hey guys member in toy story 2 is cid still a brony when he said i wanted to ride the pony?
Pony wears the saddle.
I use chrome
I use Chrome on my Android.
i use IE o.o' -prepares to die-
:P
eh, wars over browsers are so last decade. live and let live
soul! Come to the Firefox side!
Ponies47 I know that feel bro
hen3ry: Yeah. Console wars are all the rage now.
Ponies47: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClXAaGoT5eE
considering my console is a PS2, I won't be fighting
/me goes to sleep
!lottery who wants a hug?
http://fav.me/d4e28m0 I approve this Vinyl.
awww
i do
Kammerjunk 3DS is best Handheld. WiiU will be awesome
no come to the Google Chrome side
Canadian_Brony: I don't own a single console.
i play on wii.... please dont kill me :'(
Maybe.
soul I do too
No 3ds is a failure
I think I might have a Wii and a PS2 lying around somewhere.
Not sure, though.
chrome gave me a viris and told me i was fat
soul: there is nothing wrong with the Wii
wait, you dated chrome?
yes
:D
everyone just seems to hate wii
i like wii has metroid
Yes
I don't have a 360 or PS3 because I'm a Nintendo nerd. Also, the only FPS I play often is TF2
so I don't mind
soul: Well, duh. Physical movement and everything.
i think Wii has the most fun games
Hey people. What we talkin bout
I'm tired of Video games.All they have now is sequels
Canadian_Brony: I'm such a huge Nintendo ignoramus that I don't even know if Link is the guy.
Seriously, I'm a bit unsure.
yeah sequels that are shorter and have the same colored ending
Patience is a virtue that can only be obtained with time.
To be honest, I've lost interest in gaming recently
Ponies47: lol
Canadian_Brony: I see what you did there
Because, I mean, I have never played a Zelda game in my life, but I know that you control the guy in the green clothes, but is he Zelda then?
Biglaw Philosiphy with hidden jokes
the first zelda game i got was wind waker, i thought link was zelda
No his name is Link
Kammerjunk: NO! NO NO NO!!!!
I am waiting for Half Life 3 myself
Ponies47: thats one old computah
Kammerjunk: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Kammerjunk it's official that your character is Link and Zelda is the princess.
But why is the series called Zelda, then?!
If you only control Link, I mean.
MuffinsPrime: Well though luck, Valve can't count to 3
im waiting for this damn blue screen to change
idk, zelda is pretty useless
Because you rescue her all the time
Kammerjunk -_(\
Well, it's not like Mario is called Peach.
Kammerjunk: you need to play Ocarina of Time
Ponies47 b*tch please. This damn thing has been around since Windows '98
Ponies47: by any chance does it look like this? http://edge.ebaumsworld.com/picture/RipsnortChemist/corona_laptop.jpg :D
Biglaw: I'm not even sure I own a Wii.
Kammerjunk: it's an N64 game....
Exactly my point.
why did the chat stop going fast?
/me died a little on the inside
Xaiden no it's coming out here in a while from now
Kammerjunk my Wii makes a high-pitched sound when the disk spins
ha i wish i had one of those be fun to play with
Canadian_Brony: BUCKING WINDOWS 98! :[
How do you do the narrations
Ponies47 Vista's worse
Canadian_Brony: You might want to get that checked.
Kammerjunk: just download it as a ROM here http://coolrom.com
i have XP
It's been updated to XP, though
:D : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yX8yrOAjfKM
*upgraded
I have XP too ^-^
Canadian_Brony: This thing is on Windows 7 it should of never been upgraded D:
Biglaw: I need to manually get it? But that sounds like work!
Hey that is the dame website I use for roms
Kammerjunk: it is like..... twelve clicks in total
Same sorry error in my typing
Hey ponies47 and superbrony64 i'll be right back im going to go take my shower ok
My mother got her laptop downgraded from XP to Vista
Canadian_Brony: ouch
Oh right, and speaking of Nintendo, I haven't ever played a Mario game either.
O.O
O_O
*GASP*
GET OUT
Biglaw apparanetly, Vista got an upgrade that made it useful. I dont' believe ie
My childhood was books.
Kill yourself now
theres nothing wrong with that
My middle school was nooks
My childhood was books and SNES
books
everyone has their tastes
and a Gamecube
My childhood was literally centered around books. I keep getting more and more books, but IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH BOOKS.
Kammerjunk move into a Library
Yeah you run out of stuff to read
Oh, I wish.
I would love living in a library.
Canadian_Brony lol I still got my Gamecube
i was raised on books and video games, but only got intrested in books later....
I read the Twilight books in middle school
i dont like twilight....
MuffinsPrime me too! I will never, EVER, get rid of that old thing.
It's kind of funny to me that vampires have become girly.
i used to read books but i kinda of lost interest but i may have to pick that back up
The longest thing I've read was 240K words, and it was on FiMFiction
Is it true that the movies aren't even relatively close to the books?
No action in that book besides a vampire getting ripped to shreds and a war almost start
Canadian_Brony: Oh yes, it is.
Canadian_Brony: eeeeenope
Canadian_Brony same here man. I LOVE that thing
oh no! if i go out in the sunlight i SPARKLE! D:
soul :p
srry
Canadian_Brony: The Lord of the Rings, Eragon (The film absolutely sucks), even Harry Potter.
Kammerjunk Biglaw :O
She also tries to committ suicide
Kammerjunk I knew about those one
*s
Speaking of the Lord of the Rings, I haven't read those in a while.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPLmGyq8CL0&feature=related I'm listening to this :p
I haven't read Lord of the Rings, but I watched the trilogy
i havent read them yet i have school so im too busy
Canadian_Brony: But it's kind of a necessity. I mean, they can't include everything from the book into the film.
Kammerjunk if they did that, LoTR would be an 8 hour movie
for one of them
Kammerjunk I know. Have you seen or read "The Hunger Games"?
I saw it. Hoping to get some books soon.
Saw The hunger games, it was okay. Camera was too shakey at times though
Huh. I just started reading Lord of the Rings. Im on like page 10 or something
Didn't like the film. She used the bow incorrectly at times.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1egYn0Tb-rs here is another
i dont really like the hunger games... its decent, but not too intresting to me... except the zombie wolf things, which they kinda ruined in the movie
so many updates why now
Kammerjunk the books are SO much better! "The Hunger Games" just isn't a series that have to be filmed carefully because of finicky details that wrap up everything in the end
MuffinsPrime: Just wait until you get to Tom Bombadil. He's awesome.
gah, it's time to sleep
but read the books, for sure
g'night Biglaw
Canadian_Brony: Hoping to do so soon.
Good night everypony ^-^
night
Sweet dreams, Biglaw.
night Biglaw
/me hopefully I won't sleep in untill 11:40AM
:I
good morning everyone :)
I was kinda disappointed when I didn't see Tom Bombadil in the films.
Salve, sergio_scriptor.
Kammerjunk the one big turn-off for me is The Reaping. I saw it in the trailer. Ingoring the book, it was bad. Compared to the book, it was down-right awful!
Night Biglaw
Katniss had NO emotion!
night
Kammerjunk what is your favorite book series
Canadian_Brony: Sounds bad.
hi sergio_scriptor
The Demonata series
soul: At the moment? Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
I only read the Hunger Games. Was the movie any good?
Kammerjunk that's the movie. In the book, she's paralyzed when she hears her sister's name.
i hated the dogs in the film they were so.... anticlimatic
Canadian_Brony: Silly acting
MuffinsPrime some scenes weren't the greatest, but yes. I recommened watching it
A movie they killed for me was the Cirque Du Freak movie
Read the books
Oh yeah, I recently got a book titled "The Pillars of the Earth" Anypony heard of it?
Kammerjunk: i saw the tv show based on it
Kammerjunk bad writing and directing. The rest was pretty good, although the relationship between Peeta and Katniss isn't stressed enough. The movie doesn't portray it well enough to show that it's all just a show for Katniss.
hey let me know if this comes up want some opinions https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.213342982024880.66833.100000475399298&type=3
sergio_scriptor: Oh, didn't know there was one.
if anyone here has read gaurdians of ga'hoole, i really disliked the movie
Kammerjunk: it's actualy a mini-series and it's pretty decent actualy
thegt90 I get a page saying I can't access it. Mind you, I permanently shut down my Facebook account.
Canadian_Brony: Great, now you got Always Look on the Bright Side of Life stuck on my head.
(sigh) I suggest the Demonota series or Cirque du freak
Remember it's all a show, keep 'em laughing as you go. Just remember that the last laugh is on you!
ah ok then ill find anothere way
/me whistles
Kammerjunk how? I'm not a "Glass half-empty" or "Glass half-full" guy. I just drink the water
unless it's piss . . .
Canadian_Brony: o u
o.e
Kammerjunk I got that from a funny pic. I'll try to find it for you
Kammerjunk http://tetchtorres.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/halfempty.jpg
well im off, night everypony :$
I'm a glass was placed with water and how did it get here type of person. I like to look at both sides of the glass as well
Here, have a free Fluttershy in return: http://derpy.me/2skUt
night
d'aaaaaawwwwwww
:)
Gooooood morning Bronystate!
Hi MadSurge
hi MadSurge
AND IM BACK
morning ^^
Hey Biglaw
good mor- *looks at clock* good morning Madsurge! It's 12:20am here
155 songs on my playlist by brony artists
Alpha-Omega o_O
2:18
WB Biglaw
So yesterday evening, I accidentally fell asleep.
Kammerjunk seems legit
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ztFFoYhIg <- This video is pretty much me in a nutshell before I decided to cut back on soda :p
Alpha-Omega: gotta catch 'em all! :D
im currently listening to a japanese song :P
I wen literally insane yesterday st school... The kids where constntly making noise one with a whistle thing that made a buzzing noise. I couldnt take it any longer so I yelled SHUT UP!, crushed my glasses in my hand, flipped my desk, kicked over the trash can, stomed outside, and sat down ont he bench.
What the music is good
o.o
Canadian_Brony: I had been up for almost 40 hours, and I thought that I was "just going to lie down for 5 minutes."
TheRandomkid321 oh my . . .
Should've known better.
Kammerjunk meh, we all need to sleep
"Sleep is for the weak," they said. "Stay up for ponies," they said.
Yeah I got a bloody D that day on an english assignemnt so I was already pissed off.
Hi guys i'm out of the hospital now! :)
Pinkies4thWall hi. When and why were you hospitalized?
TheRandomkid321: WOW! O.O
Hmmm, is English class in Britian just Class?
Pinkies4thWall: Oh hi. What happened?
:D
Canadian_Brony and Kammerjunk: Pneumonia
TheRandomkid321: I'm sorry, I know it's no laughing matter, but when you said "flipped my desk", I couldn't help but picture that ASCII thing.
Pinkies4thWall ouch. At least you're better now
Kammerjunk :|
Pinkies4thWall: I'm glad you feel better ^_^
Also, my firefox embed is working again. WOO
Pneumonia is water in the lungs right?
MuffinsPrime eeyup
MuffinsPrime: i think that's drowning
MuffinsPrime: It's lung inflammation caused by bactarial or viral infection.
oh, oops
So probably, yeah.
MuffinsPrime pneumonia is not water in the lungs. I am a silly filly
my mother has pnuumonia
Kammerjunk: i had a softball- sized abcess in the same lung a few years earlier
Computer derp back
Pinkies4thWall: Wow.
Pneumonia is a lung infection
had to have the top lobe removed
o.o
brb
Worst that's ever happened to me was the swine flu.
. . . tmi?
Canadian_Brony I thought it was that too. We're both silly fillies
doctor's bill was >$60K
I never get sick, really. Not that I'm complaining.
>Not having free health care
wow Pinkies4thWall, how do you feel right now?:S
my mother is a lier. She said she was gonna sleep at our house, Oh wll home alone again
apendicitus is my worst
Denmark is an alright country, aftera ll.
KiwiBoi777: pretty good
Free medical acer in Australia BUCK YEAH!
Pinkies4thWall wow. DO you have health insurance?
who is everyones favorite pony?
*care
Twilight Sparkle.
Pinkies4thWall: that's good
soul Vinyl :3
Biglaw kidney stone would probably be worse
ehh, wasn't that bad.
Canadian_Brony: yeah
soul guess http://www.redbubble.com/people/stinkehund/works/7383789-i-have-a-crush-on-rainbow-dash-with-text?p=t-shirt
Twilight Sparkle, Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie, Trixie, Vinyl Scratch.
Thus is my list.
Pinkies4thWall good. Inb4 my health care is free
I honestly find having a favorite pony stupid and just makes you an obsessed fan which I am not I just enjoy the show.
I tried to memorize all the ponies even the background ponies. Too many ponies
No offence toanyone
Rainbow Dash is best pony
KiwiBoi777: if i wanted to get out of bed, i had to call a nurse. i hated it since i'm usually so independent like
TheRandomkid321: ...And then you realise that it's the same in every fandom based around a TV show, book or game series.
Also, guys, i'll be on here a lot more often.
*yay*]
Kammerjuck I have never been one for favorite characters
Pinkies4thWall: well at least you are fine now.
there's nothing wrong with having a favorite. Even tho I don't really have one myself...
'S only natural, really.
my Firefox browser decided to be awesome and have the stream embed start working again
Does anyone here have autism or know anyone with autism?
I can relate to some of them more than others but I don't have a favorite
I have a cousin who has autism.
TheRandomkid321: i have aspergers
TheRandomkid321: I had a friend with autism
Rainbow Dash is one of my favourite fictional characters ever.
>Not prone to any condition
feelsbadman
I would write an essay on why.
back
Well is autism an excuse for randomly pulling out a razor blade and attacking an innisant person with it?
TheRandomkid321: why do you ask?
no
/me hugs Ponies47. "You came back!"
Canadian_Brony: I personally think Dashie is more cute than she is awesome.
it might be a partial explanation, but it is not an excuse.
So how long have we been without a stream, just wondering?
TheRandomkid321: perhaps it was an extreme mood swing?
ive never seen anyone pick AJ before....
Pinkies4thWall: a couple hours I believe
soul: AJ is underrated.
Biglaw it happened to me and all the teachers just sy he has autism that all.... Im bloody sick of nothing happening besides a two day suspension and he was all happy about it too he said he did it for "pleasure"
AJ is overlooked
KiwiBoi777: remember that controller i was going to buy on ebay?
yea?
man, haven't been here for a while
Kammerjunk Filly Rainbow Dash is adorable. Also, comparing "cute" and "awesome" is pretty redundant because "awesome" is used too describe practically everything. It's part of our basic status speech
AJ was the best discorded pony tho. Liarjack.
hi Flutteryshy
yo
Pinkies4thWall: did ya get it?
Canadian_Brony: As in "worthy of awe".
i failed. my budget was $150 and it sold for $250
:(
aw man :S
TheRandomkid321: Well perhaps it's something that appeases him, if I were you, I'd try to steer clear of him, and if you can't perhaps try to understand why he enjoys it?
That reminds me I need a knew headset and controller for xbox 360... WHy new headset you ask? raging kid on COD tahts why... poor headset...
*sad face*
Pinkie and Dashie break physics. Pinkie does it because she doesn't care. Dashie does it because she must be the best.
my fav chracter is discord :P
Kammerjunk we use it so much today that the original meaning, as you said, "Worth of awe", has become obsolete
hen3ry: No, Dashie breaks sound barriers, Pinkie breaks physics
Biglaw he also insults me ona daily basis... Noone else but me.... He was part of why I flipepd out yesterday
and then Fluttershy just is so cute, everyone dies
Just mute the noobs your equipment will last longer
Flutteryshy until she gets pissed off . . .
Dashie pulls a dead turn at mach 17. And makes rainbows fly out her rear as she does so.
Biglaw Dashie breaks light spectrums
Wait....yup died for a couple seconds
So i'll have to commission the guy after he gets home from a vacation
Alpha-Omega Well my friend who doesnt know how to mute was playing so he just plugged the hedset in to stop the noise
and when she gets pissed off, everyone is screwed anyway :P
Has anyone heared the song Guncakes?
Ugh, my Dashie pictures are really not organised properly.
GUYS GUYS okay I know it's 4chan but I can swear you guys will love that thread http://boards.4chan.org/mlp/res/3113367
Rainbow Dash flies with humanly impossible acceleration in the S2 finale.
TheRandomkid321: I say that autism is no excuse for being rude. I'd suggest trying to tell someone of authority, and if possible, have some form of evidence since they probably wouldn't believe you if you just told them
That sucks. get turtle beach x12s they are only 60 bucks
Canadian_Brony: she hits mach 50 ^-^
Canadian_Brony: Considering the Sonic Rainboom itself was supposed to be impossible...
im goin to bed ill be on later tomorrow
Aplpha-Omega where I was thinking of gettin them
has anyone seen my YT channel?
g'night thegt90
*yeah
oh it is tomorrow
No
wut?
well night anyways
Dash and Pinkie are the only two that actually do the impossible in-universe. (No pegasus should actually be able to fly with those tiny wings)
my YT channel is best channel >:D
jk
night thegt90!
night
Good Night
what about discord?
Discord doesn't count, he can drink a glass with chocolate milk inside of it
In universe, discord is not doing the impossible. He has the magic of chaos.
and then throw the chocolate milk away
Biglaw he is the most interesting . .. . thing in Equestria
https://www.youtube.com/user/Flutteryshy
Canadian_Brony: I don't always cause Chaos, but when I do, I drink Dos Equis
im wondering, what the heck IS discord anyways?
Stay Crazy my friends
soul a draquonness I believe
soul: He's a Draconequus!
soul a god
close enough

Canadian_Brony: more like latin
I'd say Latin, but they're basically the same.
MadSurge that's what I meant
I killed the caht
*chat
MuffinsPrime, is that a why pinkie smiles GIF?
Italian, spanish, portuguese and french are all from latin :D
But yeah, equus is Latin for horse. It's the singular nominative.
guys, is it wrong that I want this as my screensaver? http://youtu.be/oTlTgIL2n8U
wait. soul, are you new?
Which means that they're doing it right, by the way.
yeah, why?
Flutteryshy wait whats GIF? im not good with internet stuff
did i do something wrong?
soul, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix7vrluEm4E
MuffinsPrime: Magical moving pictures.
it's basically a moving pic
lol
/me thoroughly enjoyed that .swf
I almost cried a bit
oh, i was just wondering. however, now i know you're new, I wishto say "Wecome to Bronystate, soul. I hope you have lots of fun here!"l
:(
CrimsonPhoenix what the hell?
Zombie_Brony, what?
ty :)
are you talking about the CMC?
so no one checked my YT is my guess :P
soul: I'd do the whole "Welcome to the BronyState Mental Asylum" thing, but I can't really remember if I already did so.
?
oh. well anyway, its just a thing i saw a while back and had a sudden urge to post it here
Never mind, then.
CrimsonPhoenix your link sent me to an error message. It said "Error 500~" and something about monkeys being dispatched to solve the problem.
Once a week, we throw a party here in chat. Once a week, BronyState will stream this and that! Ev'ry mod's anew and all anons are mods! That's the way on Topsy Turvy day!
i dunno. im weird.
You don't know your errors?
Do you know what's 404?
404- error not found
an Error
It was precious but no tear from me. I've only cried 4 tears this year not a good sign
500 is simply server off service
=_= I think I'll try to sleep again
good night again
Ha ha.
Sleep.
Good Night
Best nick evar
I cry when I can self-concious from someone
MuffinsPrime here, we're all weird. For example, I have 5 different names I commonly switch between in this chat. I'm also insane.
I get****
SLEEP IS FOR THE WEAK *Smiles Lesson Zero Twilight style with eyes deroed*
I'm a stone when it comes to emotion
Like fire, hellfire. This fire in in my skin. This burning desire is turning me to sin.

00,02soul, i pressed space one too many times
uh oh, i might have let fluffy out
i remember when i was going to play brawl with someone on here
Thanks to you phase I now know how to alternate pages more effectively
I'm going to bed early tonight. G'night everypony!
So quiet
Good night
night
:)
phase4: http://derpy.me/vpKCV
00,02ah, they are detatchable
yeah I detach em for return to save mass. I have the side tanks drain first, so...
(ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻
flipped a table nice one fluttershy
thanks
Hahaha Twilight is a troll
Flutteryshy...did they happin to have the name Superbrony64?
yes they did
:D
It saddens me that my little sister is not here. I downloaded both seasons of MLP so she could watch it with me
staging looks right, just don't forget to feed the fuel lines in.
Alpha-Omega: :(
00,02too bad you cant copy betwene designs
00,02already have rockets this would work on
how did you know shamroc?
That would be too easy
yeah, copy-paste staging would be nice.
Alpha-Omega: To bad my brother is a parasprite and hates ponies :'(
CONVERT HIM
Flutteryshy: cause hes the onlypony here who plays brawl...that we know of
I'VE TRYED! :'(
But parasprites eat things and multiply but I know what you mean. I also got my little brother into it too :D
how do you convert a little brother parasprite?
tie him to a chair
o.e
XD
:3
is this Phase4?
its easy to convert a little brother, if you don't care what you're converting him into.
00,02CrimsonPhoenix, yes
Alpha-Omega: LUCKY! He's my older brother. He hates ponies and bronies but he has never watched the show! Ws ad :'(
that Ping
*Which makes me sad
Ponies47, because he was older than you?
NO WONDER
I'm the oldest so yeah.
CrimsonPhoenix: He's 16
funny enough my sis hates bronies
lol
I'm 17
15 ftw
I'm 21
MY BROTHER WILL NEVER BE MY BBBFF!
NEVER! D:
ok Ponies47 calm down
Just because you don't have similar interests doesn't mean he can't mature.
/me Ducts tapes himself to a chair
Either way you'll still love your brother like I love my douch of a brother
Happy?
Alpha-Omega, at some point yes
My brother is a jerk -_-
I remember I hated my little sister
same here
we used to be in quarrel all the damn time
well, imma go to EPR
see you all later
ages of brothers 16, 12, and 8, and a 6 year old sister
but now I love my lil sis
Bye Flutteryshy
bye :)
Vye vYe
i need to come here more...
Bye
peace
My brother is 16. All he cares about is video games, he doesn't take care of himself, he treats me like garbage, he doesn't listen to my parents, ect -_-
Im back from taking a shower and oh crap the stream is on
Like I said. He will never be my BBBFF
NEVER
what is bbbff?
/me Facehoofs
I can only be a BBBFF
..really?
00,02hmm
Big Brother Best Friend Forever
00,02i dont think there are enough struts
Clearly not.
srry
soul: Didn't you watch the Season 2 finally?
I have all the episode in 1080p
im not thinking straight right now
soul: It's ok
/me hugs soul
Balance is key Phase
speaking of which, id better get do bed
^^
When my brother saw that I had got pony shirts and a brony wristband he was not happy D:
*to
00,02should work
night night everypony im heading to sleep
staging is even more key than balance..
Night soul and Shamroc
00,02>rcs tanks
Alright good night
No RCS thrusters.
00,02>no rcs trusters
night
Ponies47: is your brother a hater?
00,026_9
Pinkies4thWall: Yes. I huge one to. :(
I just don't know what went wrong here.
night Shamroc
We'll fond out soon enough
ok, stage 1 is clean.
00,02i'm going to screw this up so bad
Phase4: Have Faith
00,02shit
oh god
00,02spacebar is too large
Ouch.
/me Has lost all faith and trust in his brother
so Phase4 we going for mun or minmus today?
Did not see that coming. It looked clean too
he ejected early
00,02Spectrum_Rush|Zzz, mun
tank at full thrust suddenly had no dead weight, hit the rest of the rocket
Anyway who wants french ponies?
00,02most rockets survive that
00,02but this one has tanks on lander
His chat looks cooler than ours
aka targets.
00,02dead straight
00,02like an arrow
Alpha-Omega: inorite
Dont Stop, Belieeeeevin
Alpha-Omega: you can download it
i think
I'm watching the stream but I'm listening to blues right now as well :P
00,02hen3ry, when do you think the best time to turn for orbit is?
http://imgur.com/a/qUtL9#0
CrimsonPhoenix: C'est une horrible enchanteresse et elle danse comme une diablesse.
13Phase4: before you start the game duh
00,02XD
13if you started the game you are already too late
Depends on my ship really. You can pull towards 90 as soon as second atmosphere stage, but lag usually makes the decision for me
Kammerjunk, you got that from a youtube description?
CrimsonPhoenix: Nice :3
00,02burning a fair bit of fuel
CrimsonPhoenix: I've memorised it.
You're never too late for losing the game
It's Evil Enchantress.
If I'm going for minmus I don't turn at all. Just punch to 47,4 projected.
Morning everyone
Problem is that I can't make that silly French letter on my keyboard.
Holy junk, what is that game?
Winbox: Kerbal Space Program
Kerbal Space Program
Thanks
/me is tired
Nah this chat looks cleaner but not cooler
Winbox: google it. it's a free download
00,02not sure if enough fuel for this
What is winbox
You should still have enough. You have a full stack on that central engine.
I FREAKING HATE MY COMPUTER! :[
plus the lander actually has more than you need by quite a bit.
Ponies47: why?
Why Ponies47?
even if you have to push the last bit to mun as a lander, you're fine.
Cool this other chat version tells me when people login
3.5 tanks goes a long damn way with very low mass.
00,02hen3ry, thing is i'm lazy and dont aim
THE THING IS 9 YEARS OLD! It doesn't really work anymore with it's constant derps, crashs, lagging, ect! :[
00,02enough to get me into mun intercept
it's pretty easy.
When I get a new computer. THIS IS TOAST! :[
*THIS THING
orbit until munrise, punch full throttle at 90 degree orientation.
Right now you don't need any thrust.
How will it become toast Ponies47 Sledgehammer?
Or a blunt axe?
OmegaMetroidBrony: I'm gonna smah it idk how but I will and record and put it on both of my Youtueb pages! :[
*smash
Sounds like fun
hai guys
Oh hai Chrysalis
ohai Chrysalis
*Youtube
alternate method would be the Straight and Crash method. Throttle straight up until munar orbit height, then at apo, turn to 270 and match munar speed.
bad staging suddenly...
00,02well shit
And NO! My brother is not gonna help! After the way he's treatrd me NO BUCKING WAY! :[
Hey Chrysalis
00,02hen3ry, might try that next
00,02not sure if this rocket will do that though
00,02its the design from my small light lander
that's how I get to Minmus. But you need a lot less delta V once around Minmus to land.
270 collision course at Minmus, that lander can handle no prob. Not sure about Mun tho.
I think it can, but it takes longer, and that's a relatively weak engine
sorry about that i had to go pet my cat
00,02wow
00,02it has a lot of burn time
Still, the base design that I use with that lander has six liquid stages around the core. So maybe 4 isn't enough.
00,024 probably isnt
And you ejected nearly half it's fuel xD
00,02ikr
No kill like overkill
I do not remember what I was here for
nuclear missile detected
BOOM
*giggle* my hand is all tingly
...
Alright fixed my name
cool splashdown
DED-wait, no?
:(
Alpha-Omega for future reference, you can change your nick by using "/nick NewName"
without needing to reconnect
eh
......
/me Is excited
is bored
Happy fun times incoming
I prefer carpentry to rocket building
I've been wondering, is TheRainbowDash still active on Bronystate? I remember him saying something b4 my addiction broke about leaving :/
I shall go to bed now and I'll leave you guys with this http://i.imgur.com/wZeHS.jpg
I get to go to the theme park this weekend! and *Pulls out pony shirt* I'll be wearing this. I gotta tell my dad soon he's the only person who takes me out to theme parks and I really wanna wear a pony shirt there. Problem is I'm scared to tell him :s
Nighty CrimsonPhoenix
Night CrimsonPhoenix
CrimsonPhoenix: dawww :3
Ponies47, shrug the whole thing off
you want to wear that shirt wear it

Pinkies4thWall: WHAT! You we're at the hospital! :o
00,02hen3ry, good idea
Well in
00,02ohai SuperBrony64
Ponies47: yes i had pneumonia

xxMoopyxx: No. I did 13 sonic rainbooms :p
hm..... so tempted to ping
Phase4: oh, is that your ping?
i thought you did it once
00,02SuperBrony64, i'd love to see you try build rockets
I've only gotten the free version of KSP so far, but I really want to buy it :3
11,02But...I sleepies Phase4 O~O
^
00,02SuperBrony64, bed then, rockets tomorow
SuperBrony64: Sumica and Phase4 are aces at blowing up rockets, but only the latter involuntarily :D
11,02Okay, maybe tomorrow :)

Why am I yellow in his chat?
OmegaMetroidBrony: You're lucky, it's 10:41 here and I haven't had a proper sleep since 2 days ago.
02:42 here
I mean, I slept this past night, but that was for no more than 2 hours.
I only sleep 6-8
00,02 oh
00,02dat noise
I don't sleep that much :p
aww, sleep deprivation is lame
not good...
lol
what broke?
yikes
the engines are moving
lol
00,02why did that break
That went well.
YES
oh poo, bad time for the stream to buffer
Phase4: don't kill me bro
that... shouldn't have broken
More engines.
I almost died
Best launch I've seen in a while
^
No, more thrusters!
the six radials are symmetrical...
00,02silly physics
suddenly pinkie pie.
"Nevermind it's cool now"
my ears
Schrodinger's rocket :D
boom
Pinkie want big BOOM
00,02we go up
*Moopy burps out loud in the chatroom*
TO THE MOOOON
Now, for comparison, the Luna 13 is identical to this current stage (without solids), except it's only three tanks high... and I use fuel lines to detach three side tanks at a time
Gravity demands that you come back down or no dessert
dat burp
thanks pinkies4yhwall
00,02hmmm
00,02forgot the fuel lines
00,02oh well
that's always something the astronauts like hearing mid-flight :P
im guessing thats bad
What are the fuel lines for
?
to shut fuel from one place to another
you can move fuel from the outer tanks to the inner tanks (so the inner tanks are still full when you eject the outer ones)
oh noes
I'm guessing he's going to eject a lot fuel then?
It doesn't make that much difference really
I would most likely play this game just to see how many explosions I could make
Nah. The outer tanks will still be empty before the inner one.
*Moopy farts in the chatroom*
04Hey, the Greek Goddess or Law and Justice is in the chat :o
the rockets on the outer ones burn fuel faster
dat Ghosties
hi Ghosties
Oh hai Ghosties
so he won't waste any fuel in the end
exuse me
04Oh, hello
hi there :3
I'm surprised however...
ohai Ghosties
I am your host the man they call ghost
Mine doesn't have trouble reaching Mun with less fuel. This confusles me.
Hey
I guess a bigger ship needs more fuel to escape the planet's gravity
Heya Rainbow
hi Rainbow
Hi
hi Rainbow
Hye Ghosties! :)
hi rainbow
00,02go up
00,02den fall onto mun
00,02:3
Yes, but the extra fuel should have more than compensated for the extra mass.
Hey Rainbow :)
Hey
:D
that's a... funny way to get to Mun, but okie
Hey rainbow your the best pony
*Hey -_-
Thanks?
00,02this thing has a ton of fuel left
eeyup
inb4 surely you need to cut the engines though
04Hello 47
This is the first time ive been here.
Just sayin.
Ghosties: What's new? :3
O.O
?
Hey rainbow my 2 friends did the sonic rainboom in the chatroom
yay, new person :)
Hi.
Ohai Ghosties :D
Phase4: is there a limit how far you can go in outer space
It's a shame TheRainbowDash isn't here to give a welcome speech
I heard about this place but I never bothere going here :)
00,02Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, afaik no
00,02obvious software limits
Oh your going tolove it rainbow
04Well, Rainbow, enjoy your stay here :)
Well then. Everypony you know what to do.
it's a pretty awesome place in my experience
04Nothing much is new, 47 :P
WELOCME TO BRONYSTATE Rainbow!
00,02brb
Guys get the cider
TAHNKYOU!
Ghosties: Same :P

Sorry bout that Ghosties :$
Rainbow: no emote spam, Dont post video links during stream like now, dont post any .mov videos.
.mov is scary.
general stuff
Hey rainbow is it ok if i hang out with you in clouds dale?
and moderatly creepy.
Also do not request Ponies
Go ahead.
Sweet
Indeed. Never request Ponies.
Request Ponies?
04It's okay, just give an adequate warning next time ><
Ghosties: ok
00,02did i see pony request?
when you ask whoever's streaming to show something
Demand/request MLP to be stream
Yeah I would say that I would agree with you rainbow
No you did not, sir.
04Phase, NO
Fly your rocket.
Oh
I wouldn't
Phase4 i thought i saw a request too
04He's new, he doesn't know any better D:
Rainbow: requesting ponies will bring ANYTHING but FiM :D
00,02k
Phase4: NO!
He?
That is a VERY BIG NO when a certain mod streams <.< >.>
Ghosties: so I heard you like Sweetie Bell....
Usually Biggest Tea Party.
04Er...She's new, she doesn't know any better D:
So rainbow still trying to get in with the wonderbltz?
Biggest Tea Party? haha no.
go on request ponies
Ghosties: lol
Ghosties: And some mod said you were a part of the famous Sweetie bell AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA pic. :P
see what you get
04Vordox, I like Sweetie Belle so much I named her meme
00,02hen3ry, the stability is nice
Ghosties: How were you a part?
what happened Silverscreen?
Well I think I Spitfire is think about letting me in.
ow my ears
Yeah, it's my go-to design for now. I just have to learn to get similar stability in a spaceplane/shuttle.
00,02hmmm
Ghosties: Sweetie Derelle? :D or AAAAA?
04I gave it the name Sweetie Derelle
I have a few variations, but they're all similar.
00,02needs to start slowing much before periapsis
It's ok Ghosties. I was the same way when I first joined #bronystate :)
00,02not a lot of power on this thing
Nah, you're fine
I knew nothing! D:
This is my first time here.
04Silverscreen's on vacay, Darkts3
Oh by the way rainbow fluttershy was just here a minute ago?
Sounds liike zelda
Do I regester somewhere or what?
hes racing the moon!
00,02i have to land using those tanks
Ghosties: ahhhhhh
One cannot win in a race against the moon!
00,02o wait
00,02nvm
Ghosties: I'm more itnerested how you were part of it.
do not eject them.
00,02i forget how fuel works
04PHase is streaming, yes?
Yes
Yes Ghosties
even if they empty do not eject :D
Ghosties: eeyup
:0
sounds a bit like 8bit music
Ghosties, do u link horror stuff?
Ghosties: Named or not, were you a part of the creation of the pic? D:
Horror?
D:
04@Aps: No, but I would stream horror stuff when I finally learn how to stream
k Ghosties
^
and there we go, orbit get
Sounds fun
So Streams are every friday?
04I was not a part of the creation of the actual drawing, Vordox. I was just around for the creation of the meme of the drawing
google it
Hey rainbow
04BMN streams are every Friday, Rainbow
Yeah?
00,02hmmm
Ghosties: Oh, I see. Hmm
047:00 PM EDT
20% cooler
but the thrusters are too weak for a Very Low Altitude pass.
00,02not sure how high to go during landing
and again on friday for us Europeans :3
Ghosties: once you learn to stream you think i could request a horror game for ya?
K thanks Ghosties.
00,02hen3ry, yeah
04No problem, Rainbow
04I don't see why not, Darkts3
on saturday, I mean
I often just float down.
00,02hen3ry, 40km good?
Rainbow: well, streams are up whenever a mod decides to stream. Friday and Saturday we have movie nights, chosen by the lottery :D
but on a darkside approach, yeah a partial orbit is needed.
Hey rainbow when you asked are you a spy and yes i am a spy
GDI 5 am and still not sleepy :I
40km should be enough
Oh great, thanks MadSurge.
Moopy you are a spy!
Mentlegen
D:
yes i am a spy
Oh no!
:C
Spai keepin' me up at night!
I'm exciterd. I get to go to the theme park this weekend! Plus *pulls out pony shirt* I'm gonna wear this. Problem is dad still doesn't know I'm a brony and he's the only one who takes me to theme parks. I'm to scared to tell him :s
is it bad wanting Phase's rocket to crash?
:(
Phase4: trying to land on moon?
*excited
Gentle men
Lol my parents dont care.
Cool
Ponies47: im sure everything will go fine
Ookay.
If Phase lands on the moon, I will fire the party cannon.
04Yume Nikki and .flow would be my starting games for my streaming. I plan to branch out to include Amnesia, Cry of Fear, Afraid of Monsters, and Lone Survivor eventually too. And the penultimate would be a live LP of Silent Hill 2 and 3.
Is there a way to register or something?
00,02using a fair bit of fuel
Hey rainbow do you have a xbox elite?
Ghosties: kewl Silent hill
Sounds like an excellent line up
00,02Rainbow, for the newsletter?
Phase4, https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/406166_330643647023531_1618534745_n.jpg ( Caution Language)
Ghosties: that sounds awesome :$
I have Yummi Nikki
Yeah, it does use fuel, but you have plenty for return. You should either just empty or have a bit left in the side tanks on touchdown
Ponies47: i thought i did to, but not tired
Has any one played the 087 SCP?
Ghosties: have you heard of a game called Slender?
OmegaMetroidBrony: odds are som ppl did
But even if you overburn, 2 full tanks in the center core
I new to this.
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, FUCK DAT GAME
plenty for return
04No, Darkts3, but if it's related to Slenderman then I'm ALL FOR IT
Aps: ahahaha
So please dont go ahtin on me.
Ghosties: it is :3
/me fucking loves Slenderman
Vinyl?
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, ive seen it im like fuck its all jump scares
Rainbow: eeyup
:D
Ponies47: i have that shirt also :$
don't rely on orbital track for this.
Hey rainbow i challnge you to a flying contest who ever has the best flying skills wins
click where it says Orbit, to change to surface display
I'm diggin the emoticons :)
Ghosties, https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/406166_330643647023531_1618534745_n.jpg
Ponies47: eeyup
Rainbow: kinda obvious, but who's your fav pony?
Okay thanks Ghosties.
04Not a problem ^_^
00,02hen3ry, drop speed now?
Make that retro direction point straight up, then freefall to about 8 km (or a speed > 300 m/s) before resuming landing burn
i now like Ghosties :3
takes forever to land at slow speed
04Lol, thanks I guess Darkts3
04OH
04That reminds me!
04I would do marathons of Marble Hornets :3
knowing where the damn ground is is the hardest part. :/
Phase4 is going to do it :o
00,02dis thing is dead stable
00,02i'm on a hill
00,02not too high though
small hill is fine. Might skid.
Ghosties: WOO Marble Hornets!
00,02as long as i dont lose my engine
Ghosties: hmmmm
then meteor comes and hits u
Phase you got this
00,02hen3ry, at 8k drop to?
heh
Phase4, https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/528945_338830032857912_1930813701_n.jpg so true
Oh I get thanks!
This song reminds me of Metroid Prime 2 :/
at 8k, I try to keep speed below 100 m/s, and at 6 km, below 50.
You guys are really helpfull :)
00,02little fast
ha ha
Europony I think right?
after that, its based on where the hell I am before I cut to 20 for final approach, then below 5 for touchdown
http://i.imgur.com/jCrJx.jpg Most helpful
Ideally, below 2.
I wub you guys! :)
/me returns the wub to Ponies47
/me glomps Ponies47
00,02uses shit all fuel
00,02can probably hover like this
04<Rainbow> You guys are really helpfull :) <-- ^^
Super Ponybeat
:D
hai everypony. :#
:3
Oh hai Spell-of-Gaming
Do I have to say anything in the email Ghostie?
04Nope
yay this song
ello Spell-of-Gaming
K
...
Thank you!
Just downloaded slender
when landing view horizon
04You're welcome
he can't see it because he's busy landing..
Damnit I know the song but I can't place it
best music for Phase4's landing
00,02i'm liking this lander
/me fires the party cannon
K sent the email!
Excellent remix of Avast Fluttershy's Ass
sweet landing :o
sorry it cant be the whole plethora of images Phase4 but here http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/56e4bfaed220d20265a46e1ddbe0c86c.png
sucess
When you're ready to return, eject those side pods the second you're airborne to kill off mass, and you'll ahve plenty of delta V to return
my landings tend to be far more explosiony
00,02hen3ry, my minimal lander can do this but its a pain to pilot
more than a tank, probably don't even need the ejection
00,02i blame the controlls
Yeah, the controls are weird, that's why I built wider
i'd post a video link that is relevent but stream :(
I don't need 3.5 tanks
Hey Is roleplay allowed? (not that i want to role play)
But I do need a triangle.
00,02well
00,02home time
Only during Maid Hour but only lightly
Okay cool
I can understand why.
00,02oh yeah
00,02its orbit is sync
Maid Hour is back right guys?
00,02gona have to swing around the mun
xD
04Yeah, we really try to keep roleplaying down
04But I've seen Nittany do Maid Hour before recently so yeah, I believe it's back
I like your red text there Ghosties :p
Yay
04Oh, thanks Rainbow
:D
I want colored text :(
umm
was that suppost to happen?
I do too Alpha, I do too.
You guys are so helpful. Like the day I told my mom I was a brony. I had you guys by my side. That went well :3
the ejection, Darkts3|Drawing|MLG? Yes.
those were empty tanks
I dont have to worry about my parent think I a brony.
00,02nice music
*parents
polar orbit.
00,02and polar orbit because why not
Its nice to caht with bronies.
*chat
:)
Shame we didn't get to visit Luna on the moon :<
Stupid typos.
me to
true, won't matter much. You'll still be in Kerbal orbit the second you leave Mun's ZOI
Its 7:15 pm where I am.
5.14 am with a sleeping problem here
yup
No SAS on the last stage - they were ejected with the side tanks.
its 5:16 over here
Lol.
00,02hell of an orbit
04Come around more often, Rainbow. We have bronies chatting all the time in here :)
D
*:D
I blame a SCP
So many typos.
I'm here more or less
i blame SCP 001
My keyboard is so bucking tiny.
Hey rainbow stay with us for a while
that's a pretty round orbit. Get a fair way away from Mun before you do your return burn.
I'll try.
I blame SCP's 087 and 173
00,02hmmm
04Oh, also, Rainbow, don't try SCP
otherwise it might recapture you
Evening all.
LOL
No.
04If you're easily scared, just don't go for it
Oh okay.
I ty[e with one hand
Morning Loopy_Legend
lol
tpye
Don't worry rainbow i'll buy you an apple cider its on me
hi Loopy :3
say ghosties since you like Slenderman do you want a link to the Slender game?
04It's just a really popular horror game right now
Are timezones got to love them.
ya
forget it
Good lord a Slenderman game?!? :O
yup
04Nah, not right now Darkts3. I'm playing Human Revolution currently
alright
That is what I get for typing in the dark
04Thanks though
I didnt sleep for a night after Luna game.
SomI dont think I can stand that.
00,02lol
*so I
00,02can re-enter mun orbit
You could.

apparently theres not a exact website with the download =/
I've done it by accident before
Then again I am a girl.
Honestly no scary games give me nightmares anymore. I'm immune
I'd like to have SCP-662 I think it was.. Mr. Deeds. He's pretty awesome
Here you go rainbow an apple cider
Braggy.
Alpha-Omega: its not about nightmares, its about if you can sleep or not
Thanks Moopy!
I love scary games/movies
your welcome
I cansleep still
and even when I do get nightmares, they don't really bother me much :P
the one thing about this design... at perip at Kerbal you're going so fast, that that little dinky rocket can't really do much to adjust trajectory.
I get nightmares about nothing in reality.
^
So I dont that much.
for some reason when i get nightmares i have the power to rewind my dreams lol
Probably shouldn't share this dream but oh well
I've thought about braking orbits might help tho.
it is funny how the music is apropriate for the situation
04<Hrafn> I love scary games/movies <-- IMO there are no real scary movies anymore
^
Ao Oni had no affect on me :D?
that's true, most modern horror movies are just lame
Ii dreamt that I was in my home and I knew something was there I felt it's presence
Ao Oni isnt really that scary
Yeah.
or you can just hope you're over water
Any one remember Camp (S)Laughter?
So I went to a house outside that was Pinkie pie's home and slept there to feelk safe
But I just dont like the fact of being chased by this giant purple naked thing.
04If there's one thing the video game industry does much better than film, it's horror. Video games have a much better handle on evoking fear from the player than a movie does from a viewer.
basically modern horror movies are just remakes, sequels, and copys of the old classics
OmegaMetroidBrony: i remember a certain thing called Bunny man xD
Bagman
I sang to help me and she sang in her slept and I drifted to seep in my dreams
00,02wonder if joysticks work
Video games can make the player feel helpless.
Movies, can't.
00,02^ Rainbow
OmegaMetroidBrony: hmm i remember a bunny in it
supposedly they do, but are a pain to get calibrated in-game right. It doesn't use the Windows joystick settings right, from what little I've seen.
Video games are the future :3
But it'd be the only way to really pilot without ASAS
Movies are mainly just jumpscares now-a-days.
Yeah I called him bagman but bunnyman does like the bunnies
00,02games are in a much more powerfull position to elicit emotions
/me Looks at clock
Ghosties, I agree, a game can feel so much more frightening to me, since it makes me feel like I'm the one in a scary situation, but when I'm watching a movie it just feels like I'm watching it happen to someone else, which isn't nearly as scary
4:20 AM! :o
Well, guys i love talking with you, but it's 3:20, and i need to sleep. Good night!

yeah your gala song
00,02hen3ry, theres a mod that does things like angle for retro
wub wub wub
04So then basically F.E.A.R.
but do you always dress in style?
O.O
ya
Sumotori Dreams anyone?
Phase4: I've heard of it, but I run my version stock - mainly because of lag.
i do
Funny as heck.
I get altimeter bugs with a rocket simpler than the one you just flew.
ie, no solids attached.
Hey rainbow do you have a xbox elite
Rainbow: I got a 9 year computer how do you think I feal? :(
and fewer struts
Awww. its k
Rainbow: know that feel sis :(
hmm
so you do
mine single core 4ghz intel pentenium 2005 or something that
Damn server
I'm running this on a 3yr old mini laptop
00,02SCIENCE

Phase4: do you mind if i post a video link that is relevent to your rocket sucess?
00,02trying to have a look see at how apollo did it
but you didn't answer myquestion rainbow
apollohoax. *facehoof*
a while back when my old computer broke, I was stuck with my ancient Pentium 2 for a while :P
It's pretty strong and tough for its type.
00,02Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, not at all
Lol
00,02hen3ry, ikr
yay
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_VheAwZBuQ
00,02did link me to this though
apollo had a universe that can handle n-body.
00,02hen3ry, thats a point
00,02HEAVY YES
If I remember right, the insertion orbit to the Moon was a figure 8 shape.
Hrafn: I found A internet starter floppy disc for windows 3.01 two mounths ago in ymroom.
:3
oooh, sweet :)
:D
Clowns are evil man
FIVE FREE HOURS OF INTERNET!
00,02hen3ry, yeah, thats what i was thinking when trying to transfer into kerbin orbit
00,02Rainbow, :D
I love retro computer stuff :P
:D
00,02fun fact: i have one of those aol things here
00,02in australia
Five free hours....
00,02no clue how it got here but i have one
I used to have an AOL disc mobile.
>get five free hours of internet
shiny but useless, just like AOL itself
The floppy disc is still in its packaging too :D
> use it for porn xD
...
Porn?
Um...
I am reborn!
:D
speaking of retro tech, my mom wanted to throw away their old mobile phone, but I got it instead... it's one of those really ancient ones, a Storno 480
weighs about 10kg
wow nice.
Is it indestructible?
00,02lucky apollo
00,02they could dock
Shaped like a banana?
it doesn't work with the GSM grid, though
Throw it at things
Lol?
nah, it's shaped sort of like a briefcase with a phone attached by a cord
I have licorice all over my hands.
I have to type with two fingers.
Apollo 13 was truely lucky
Lucky, but at the same time, it was cost vs safety in some sense... since they had to then re-dock after their lunar mission.
i.e., hit a bullet with a bullet.
well not quite that bad, but still.
00,02so
00,02my launch plan was about the same
00,02orbit kerbin, transfer, orbit mun
00,02hen3ry, was a little tricky then yeah
Truly* lol
00,02these days computers
00,02so much easier
00,02well, better computers
00,02theirs was like a wristwatch
Yeah. late 60s computers weren't much beyond the punchcard stage.
and the one on the ship itself... actually I don't think they had an onboard.
it's really impressive how fast computers have evolved
it would have been too heavy
Gonna shower now
xxMoopyxx: You my friend are at the botton of the list. Nice going!
Have fun Alpha-Omega
00,02hen3ry, they had one
thanks rainbow

OmegaMetroidBrony: I would give you some, But its the internet
My favorite bit about the early space program was us spending millions to develop a pen that could write in space. While the Russians, they used a pencil.
／人◕ ‿‿ ◕人＼ Wanna sign a contract?
I know :D
Contract?
they are awesome pens, though :P
Space pen will be superior to those Commie pens
00,02seems that most of the computing was done on the ground
hmm
Considering most computers were the size of a room...
00,02hen3ry, i've heard that one, not sure if joke or srs
It would be exspensive to take a Computer to space.
00,02the pen taht is
00,02that'
ಠ__ಠ
／人◕ ‿‿ ◕人＼
I know we spent money developing a spacepen. I'm not 100% certain if the Russians used a pencil, or just stole our pen.
p_o
probably both tho.

Licorice > Pepper seeds and Popcorn Kernals
Whoo are you who who who who.

:D
popcorn kernels are pure evil
^
But they ar edible :(
*are
Edible Evil
Baked Bad?
00,02cant realy use their orbits
00,02or anything realy
I'm pretty sure popcorn is out to kill me
00,02n-body problem is more important than i thought
Kill your gums
^
But still edible.
and Evil
What about carmell popcorn?
/me ／人◕ ‿‿ ◕人＼ Contract? I can make miracles happen.
And Colored popcorn?
I don't eat Caramel Popcorn much
The other issue is that the ratio of gravity between Earth and Moon is far closer to a double-planet than the Kerbal-Mun ratio, I believe.
FUCK YES
00,02i'ma add weight to this and try for a minmus/mun flight
Caramel popcorn. What?
Never had that either but I'm pretty sure they're just as evil
Phase4: I has got Source filmmaker
00,02[wklmjhe]JRP2234, : D
sudden music
00,02you got beta keys?
nope
Alchemist: Its Popcorn covered in Caramell sauce.
Every Villian is Lemons
it just apeard in my game list
man i want SFM id like to make Meet the Pyro with no pyroland in it
I approve of caramel
I can't land a shuttle on Mun or Minmus. Get to final lander stage, and suddenly go end over end. Damn weight balancing issues.
Rainbow: did you watch all of season 2? :D
Rainbow: I know, but still. Ew.
Yes.
Villians do love to burn things down
Why wouldnt I?
:((
00,02hen3ry, my plan for this is to attach a lander when they add docking
:[
00,02so i'ma try mun->minmus flight
Oh woaw.
Rainbow: I had to push the chick that made me watch ponies to go on watching season 2 :D
Looking at that ship, my concern would be "back home"
00,02not sure if use this one or bigger one
Lol.
00,02hen3ry, it can make it
you've got a flying brick
Ouch man
00,02it'll be fine
MadSurge: Nice.
00,02i have parachutes
She got you into it and didn't want to watch S2....
OmegaMetroidBrony: more like laziness
Finished showering
Wait is the stream to the left Live?
00,02i think dis one is better
Yes
00,02has bigger rockets
Cool.
Rainbow: yep, Phase4 here is making rockets
dat rocket
00,02but i hate the way it looks and no srb's
Nice
My shuttle is a spaceplane at the top... but, balance issues... and the main thrusters had to move to top-bottom to balance rocket thrust... which means I have to detach them for actual landing.
I was wondering about all this space talk
not that landing works yet. :/
Heh :D
00,02those extra two tanks are to simulate the weight of a lander
Rainbow: what we see depends on what mod is streaming, since we all have different tastes :D
K
Okay.
00,02i forgot how slow this one launches
Isnt that construction a bit assymetric?
So no whining if the mod streams something that isn't your cup of tea
lolololol
Its a few secounds delayed that vid.
Lol I dont care.
:D
hi guys im back :) how is everyone doing ?
00,02perhaps a 3rd row of srb's
Wb sergio_scriptor
Kyuubey hacked a Philippine government site
Good Sergio!
Rainbow: yeah, but you can refresh the stream if it gets really bad
I don't like SRBs... they don't really add much
00,02they add a bit
Its okay.
/me waves back at OmegaMetroidBrony
I'll use em in some designs, but that short burn time...
Rockets is science.
00,02and this thing CaNNOT launch without it
Science is FUN.
00,02yeah, realy need longer burning srb's
Dunno about that...
I think Luna14 has a couple SRB stages to get off the damn platform.
Cleaning up the mess of failed Science isn't fun
Science ! It works, b*tches!
But I don't like it xD
Rainbow: yeah, but you don't have to be a rocket scientist to play this game :D
Omg LMFAO
:D
Best pun Ive seen in Mounths.
/me is a pungeon master
:)
:D
That shower felt great
:$
nope, I was wrong. Luna 14 uses a extra row of liquids
I should probably shower and head off to the store soon myself... but I'm lazy
They feel better after 100+ temperature work
it's a bit of a beast, but gets the job done.
Lol.
Whats the rocket game called?
Kerbal Space Program
^
Rainbow: kerbal space program
Is it difficult?
Luna14 also has a modified lander, it was an attempt to do a controlled landing back on Kerbal.
Rainbow: it depends on the type of rocket you build
K
00,02well
DL and let your inner Rocket Scientist out... or just blow the rockey up...
00,02that didnt work as expected
I found it difficult at first, there's a lot of trial and error before getting a ship to work, but it's fun
I would play it if i could.
Rainbow: you can also not care and make exploding rockets :D
00,02those tanks are suposed to stay on but whatever
DO A BARREL ROLL
Rainbow: it's free :)
staging or just broke off?
dat spin
WOOO
sorry for random off topic but this OC is super cute! http://derpy.me/43zGG
Yeah My pc would be abl to handle it.
Indeed it is Alchemist
00,02hen3ry, staging
Alchemist: it so cute /)*3*(\
KSP looks addicting.
00,02they were suposed to stay on and simulate a lander in weight
00,02Rainbow, is a bit
GDI I'm now obligated to stay awake till 10pm this evening
:D
Avast your Arse music?
Hit 6 am
GDI? Global Defense Initiative?
Rainbow: the most remixed song on youtube :D
:D
God Damn It... like the clouds for not raining
Indeed.
death to GDI!
00,02i could have sworn this thing had more fuel
MadSurge: i thought the most remix song on youtube was the sparta remix :|
lol
brb Grabin edibles (that isnt anything to do with corn kernals)
anypony here live in San Diego?
Nope
Rainbow: stick around, you're gonna hear quite a lot of pony remixes/original songs
fraid knot
Midwest/East Coast here
00,02hmmm
00,02need to add more tanks later
00,02and mabey change engines
Phase4: have i shown you this idk
And now Noctural
This is in San Diego: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uNRpFL8i4Ig/T_vNG_NVlBI/AAAAAAAAvyE/tQxU9SUMVMY/s1600/1.jpg
Phase4: you are doing a barrel roll :D
Bucking computer
*nocturnal
00,02anyway

00,02sergio_scriptor, indeed
no i want to vist San Diego just to ride that, only 2 hr drive from here
song is oddly fitting....
you know equestria daily made an app I have it.
Phase4: Don't care, had orbit :P
For my life to be complete I still need to see a bboy in a rainbow dash t-shirt :D
It's a game
I have a Flootershai shirt
about destroying email
And now sleep wants to creep up on me... :I
Back
Wb
Thanks
I need a pony shirt :'(
^
I want a bracelet
Everyone Guess what my edible is?
A castle?
chips?
Nope
muffin?
A rainbow?
Nope
OmegaMetroidBrony: get up from the chair, do some push ups, wash your face. That might help a bit.
Nope
i want a twilight,doctor whooves and trixie shirt :'(
Starts with C
What chair? I'm on a hard wood floor
...wait, there are edibles that aren't muffins?
Rainbow: cupcakes? :D
cookie
OmegaMetroidBrony: that makes you that much closer to doing push ups then.
I have a half eaten (drumroll)
/me has Dr.Whooves shirt :I
.
Carrot.
:I
Completely eaten Carrot now.
Rainbow: healthy!
sergio_scriptor: :D
I was to lazy to amke something.
Ponies and Horses do enjoy a good carrot every now and then
^
Though I think they prefer an apple
So I just Got a carrot.
And granola
Washed it.
And started numming.
Tasty
00,02had to start dinner
00,02so...
sergio_scriptor: it looks like this :I http://derpy.me/DM1hY
And my sister jst gave me here leftover dinner.
L33T
The shiry
*shiry
:I
Rainbow: older or younger sister?
Older :3
00,02i have no clue how to aim
dat me song :3
Phase4: can you get in a steady orbit with one of kerbal moons ?
I really wish there was a better way to test these damn things in Kerbal... I don't even know if my shuttle is backheavy or frontheavy
00,02sergio_scriptor, thats the plan
Oh yes... elder siblings... Awesome at times and annoying at others
00,02go for minmus or mun first?
Same goes for younger ones
Phase4: u liek?
Phase4: the one that is closer
/me is the elder sibling
My sister that gave me the food Is my secound older sister
00,02sergio_scriptor, k
/me is in the middle
/me is also the older sibling
Mun is closer, but getting Mun to Minmus is even tricker than Kerbal to Minmus.
00,02hen3ry, thats what i'm thinking
The youngest of the oldest of my sisters is a noying.
*anoying
I'm the youngest of three, and both my brothers are bronies too :P
lol
:d
I dont have brothers.
Phase4: it will be a chanllenge :P
My little bro is a quite the hater
And I'm a girl.
00,02mun it is
So I'ts kinda evened out.
both my bros are bronies :$
Rainbow: so you're the youngest?
Yup
I've heard anywhere but the middle is best
I'm the suitable age for mlp to :D
/me isn't sure thats true
Ponies47: oh ur still here
/me is 28 :P
:D

Uh oh...
I bet Im the youngest here...
00,02eh
Rainbow

/me No Comment
THAT'S NOT FUNNY! D:
Phase4: i know i wsa trying somthing diffrent
04I swear, it's like we don't have a medium age of people in this chat XD
Ponies47: slap him for me, will ya? :|
hen3ry: Yes he is -_-
04Either you're a teenager or you're an adult.
:D
MadSurge: U can not explain how much I wanna bet the crap outta him sometimes -_-
I mean, I'm all for 9/11 jokes, but that is just bad :(
Ghosties: well that is the average of the bronie fandom :)
MadSurge: Ikr? :(
But aren't adults actually children on the inside?
Having and age restriction would stop from bronies from become grown bronies..
I'll never be an adult
^
Being an adult is overrated.
^
Didn't Walt Disney say something like that?
Not to mention. HE HATES PONIES! D:
^ D:
Nearly on the mun!
00,02meh
forever a teen? twentityteen
OmegaMetroidBrony: yes,i just dont remember what
00,02inexact orbit
00,02good enough
Lol
you know... people are allowed to no like ponies, everyone has different tastes...
^
00,02might straighten it up a little then trasfer to minmus
00,02somehow
cooking lunch at 5am. Seems legit
Ponies47: is he a bitch that likes bananas?
that transfer is gonna be a mess. I'm not quite sure how to pull it off efficiently.
TO THE MOON^
Alpha-Omega: what are you cooking ? :)
Yes ppl don't have to like ponies but when their dislike gets a bit too aggressive it kind of annoys me
^
Haters^
MadSurge: He hates banana's. But there a re no banana's on the moon :3
Haters r bad.
Hot dogs. I don't feel like getting fancy and I'm going to sleep soon.
Nyan cat now?
Ponies47: eeeyup :D
Nyan Dash*
:D
Lol
Nyan Me?
in the words of ruxin "all the haters can suuccccck iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit"
My brother hates on ponies nad bronies alot! D:
*and
S2 Ep8 there's a poster of it in the club meeting
I was kicked for sending quicks msgs' :C
Lol
00,02ok
MadSurge: Well my brother you won't find any banana's ON THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONAAAAA!
04Yeah, we have an auto kick to prevent message spamming
Rainbow: don't do that :D
00,02from here i could drop a lander
Damn me and my tiny sentences.
00,02land
00,02then re-join
Phase4: how much fuel you got left ?
Welp.
00,02sergio_scriptor, plenty
My hair feels so soft :P
Know I know better
Ponies47: maybe he'll grow out of it :D
00,02~3 to 4 tanks worth
My heair feels greazy.
Thats a fancy silent "K" you put on Now
:3
I like this Mlp songs motage thingy.
my hair feels... beard
Rainbow: shower more often :P
:|
My hair feels, chocolate
I need to shampoo more.
Rainbow: lol
My hair greases easily.
:P
Discord raaaaiin
Chocolate rain.
Some stay dry and others feel the pain.
MadSurge: I really wish my brotheer would just stop hating. Iq tryed to show him the show he's freaking 16 and when I tryed to show him he just looked around to find anything he could play with like a 3 year old would! D:
My hair isn't pleasant to wear in the sung for long periods of time. Especially Strawberry Festivals
*sun
*I
Wear in the sung. Seems legit.
00,02well whoops
00,02oh well
*brother
yeap the sung, it's that thing that floats in the sky
Lol ^

So i can be on almost all the tie D
Do you want a card?
*:D
ahh sustanence
00,02not sure how to transfer
Rainbow: me too :P
:D
Let's get this party started, let's get this party started, when we party we will always party hard, PARTY HARD
:] yus
/me does not have the ability to "Party Hard"
I find it funny how I was in culinary arts and I'm too lazy to cook fancy things
OmegaMetroidBrony: then Party Soft :D
Bronystate "Mane" chat. I see what u did thair ;)
Fancy things take time, which you don't want to spend cooking
Sometimes life with my brother just makes me wanna smash somthing like his PS3 -_-
Who hasn't been there?
RIGHT IN THE SONY
Ouch
I dont have brothers.
Alpha-Omega: who needs fancy things when you can lauch sandwiches all day :) my student diet
Ponies47: does he play call of duty?
lol COD fans will prolly suffer from high blood pressure
MadSurge: He has all 7 of em and never plays em.
I need a hug. Its freezing here.
Om here
Thats a prediction
*im
/me hugs Rainbow
Oh hai TheRandomkid321
X3
Call Of Duty? its all aboot Battlefield :$
Rainbow: where is your here?
00,02hen3ry, little help here?
I like both COD and Battlefield
Australia
I only TF2 :p
Nah it's all about the pirated emulators and pony
I just want to learn how to cook so that I can feed myself good food. And possibly cook for my wife/Girlfriend. No I don't have a girlfriend. For some reason I like the craziest girls
Rainbow: nice, Phase4 is an aussie too!
Er... you need to get down to the plane of Minmus' orbit...
:D
not sure if that's north or south from where you are currently.
Easturn Austalia.
00,02yup, G'day mate
:D
00,02hen3ry, i have no clue how to change the ecintriciyt of an orbit
Which state u In Phase?
00,02or how to spell the word
00,02Rainbow, victoria
I find that I am random.....squirell
if you're in the equatorial plane, burn at either 0 or 180
Wait... Eastern australia aint a state!
Im in the Act :\
Oh
if you're not... have to adjust slightly
Im in QLD
I didnt say t was a state.
NASA released some High Res Pictures taken from the Surface of the Mars by an Roboter on the Ground... Looks like a Red rock desert
I was just narrowing it down lol :d
im a portuguese living in switzerland :P
but since I'm not sure which way is north, don't know wheter 0 or 180 is better here
brb Need more EDIBLES.
I have relatives in Australia :o
jk
pro: I let my cat outta my room and she shuts up Con: I might get caught by my mom if I open my door she might here it
partially
00,02time warp time
BEWARE
did you burn 90 or 270?
00,02this might take a while
Let's do the time warp AGAAAIIIIIIINNNN!
Pulling a Dr'Hooves
00,02hen3ry, i burned in about that direction
90 or 270 tho
Guys Im eating Rarity.
00,02i cant relate the naveball to directions yet
it matters a lot
O.O
I'm eating Marshmellows.
What? :O
:D (le trollface)
you're either chasing Minmus forever, or you're on a collissionish-course with it.
Good morning everypony! :$
Rarity on a stick
Moin RaveBrony
hi RaveBrony
/me Hasen't ate a marshmellow in a long time
hi RaveBrony
Morning :D
hi RaveBrony :3
00,02lol
Hey RaveBrony
00,02i'm gaining on minmus at 20 meters a second
yup
Its Night here in Teh ACT
What
this could take a while then...
/me waves to OmegaMetroidBrony, sergio_scriptor, Lil_B, Hrafn, and Ponies47 :)
Is the night in the act of doing?
The difference between Phase4 and Sumica... Is phase4 actually trys
Alpha, Old marshmellos where made out of horse hooves.
TheRandomkid321: :D true
I pretty much stopped eating chicken due to the fact it makes me feal like I'm eating Scootaloo :p
best burn strategy for minmus is 270. Chasing minmus around in the same direction as it's traveling is a long game
And people say that rairty is soft like a marsh mellow.
So There
Thats why rarity is marsh mellows.
I eat food no matter what. I love food too much
I just realised.
My food usually ends up in a tortilla
No I'm not fat I weigh 120 lbs
Someone need to make a Rarity Mane and stick hat onto a Marshmalow... and make a pair of eyes
Rarity cant be made of marshmellows.... I actualy like marshmellows
I had Kentucky Fried Scootaloo last night.
:D
00,02stupid orbit
I eat my biggest fan.
Nom.
00,02280m/s
00,02wonder if i can turn around and go backwards
I HATE KFC! :[
to go faster than Minmus, you have to be inside its orbit.
Nom is very effective against KFS!
00,02hen3ry, yeah
Ponies47: u mean KFS
kfc= too greasy
00,02think i can turn around?
/me KFS faints
Popeyes
00,02600m/s delta v?
Turning around and going in the same orbit but opposite direction is best way to catch Minmus. But since you're already where you're at, shortening your orbit might be the better of bad options.
*I HATE KFS! :[
Rainbow used Nom: ITS SUPER AFFECTIVE. Scootaloo fainted.
has any pony seen AgentKalim on yet?
Ponies47: :$
:D
/me Is on a diet
00,02i'ma try turn around
Do you want to switch ponies?
Wait.
Does anyone know where I can play that mlp pokemon clone?
Nope
I play inside fluttershy.
my diet mainly consist of sandvich
TREEhouse.
Rainbow o-o
TREE
00,02not sure what that glitching is
Flutters a tree.
Doh ho ho
You mean Ponymon Dawn/Dusk
?
I have to water a dozen Fluttershy's here
any dayZ-players in here?
I guess I hit people with SweetieB and appleB then.
got ny working servers?
Drk
around 2.5 gallons a Fluttershy
sergio_scriptor Studys revieled that its doesn't matter what you eat, as long as you get all the caloriens you need for a day, you will get all the vitamins and neutritions you need
^
dark_Horst macso no
Lil_B: nice :) thanks for that information
Doesn't apply if you eat *yay*
Pinkie Pie is cotten candy, Rainbow Dash is Skittles, Rarity is marashmellow, Applejacks ceral, Twilight is ?, and Fluttershy is ? :P
00,02lol
YUSH
00,02turn around and go the other way
00,02in a spaceship
I AM SKITTLES!
00,02seems legit
Twilight is.... Purple Peeps?

Twilight Is purple Nerds.
Twilight is Lollipop

00,02oh wow

Especially hearing the swears
00,02Dark_Horst, ikr
OmegaMetroidBrony: well at least i think it's funny :)

TheRandomkid321: yes it is
Boondocks.
:(
I dont like it.
So many F-bombs and racial slurs
Racism.
Boondocks isnt that bad imo.
Isnt it made by black people?
I'll watch it and enjoy from time to time
Rainbow: there's this funny thing. we call it satire
:|
TheRandomkid321: yep
Boondocks has some good laughs,but in my opinion feels a little racist...just saying
^
00,02huh
dont bash it till you try it then once you have you can pummel the fuck outa it really really hard...unless it was good
00,02going too fast
00,02realy have to aproach going in the same direction as minmus
00,02but i've proved its posible and this craft can do it
00,02now to wait for .15.3
I bashd the fuck out of MLP after watchign it nd before watchign it... Btu the first episodes I saw where the discord ones which ecplin my hatred for the show... I HTE DISCORD! The best thing to come from discords idea was music
Yes the song!!!

I like this song...

I like remixes
/me notest that "Call me Fitz is on Tv"...does not care about it
Chysalis vs. Discord: Who would win?

*rage
Oh, Pinkie said she wanted to help her make some "Cupcak.es"
/me appears

Stepping into dangerous territory there...

Rainbow: NO... :|
O.0
What's going on here? Are you landing on a moon? o.o
Mutterguy: It would tip on impact and explode
Okay.
in wich case sure
GrimGallop: yep
Where's Woona?
Groovy
how do you do dat thing with the noise and the name
Mutterguy: Center of gravity is really shaky out there.
fair point
wow long fall
BUFFER CIRLCE GO AWAY..
Mutterguy: see how the pod is tipping how it is. Its because of Woonas gravitaional effect on it. :3
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: it's the moon after all :|
Dat ASS
shes shouting at is too much
I might go getting to bored.
Will the moon become 20% cooler once this ship has landed?
Bye

Phase4: Damnit phase! >:3 -lol
well, that can't be good
they are now "Lost in Space" :)

00,02Mutterguy, they do
00,02not gona help them much though
Still getting a video feed after the explosion... seems legit
shot some stuff up. feel manly now.
04So, I've been doing the infinite XP glitch in Deus Ex Human Revolution for over an hour now and I'm at 26,500 XP. The total amount of Praxis Points needed in the game to reach full augmentation is 68...which equates to around 272,000 XP. Needless to say I have a VERY long way to go x__________________x
if they did they'd be able to get out and fix it
OmegaMetroidBrony: yea right
lol
that crazy ship control
lol
00,02hmmm
Barrel roll back home

hell of a ICBM
sonic rainboom

Anyway hi Sumica :D

sergio_scriptor Actually I dreamt of being homeless and blind. It was interesting.
Sumica at least your OC is still female
/me nuzzles Sumica. (I forgot to do that earlier)
so sergio you wanna play Zombie panic?
WEEEEE *BOOM*
Quick_Thinker: just let me instal it,nd yes why not ?
ok
...
GAH! I'M GETTING TO SLEEPY!
The lack of sleep is making me see imaginary spiders out of the corners of my eyes..
I'm gonna hit the hay
Night :)
Morning Ponies47
bye Ponies47 dont let the slenderman cathc you in your sleep :)
/me Looks outside
the most annoying thing is when my cat asks for food i put it in her bowl and she turns her nose up at it and goes outside
Uh. I mean good morning/night :$
that happened again just now
You know what? Buck it I'm staying :p
Excellent
You might want to put 50 more cents into the parking meter
oh man. Did EQD have to post that pic on there?
Does anyone here have either MicroVolts, Heroes of Might and Magic 6 or Dungeon Defenders? I'm looking for ponys to play with now and then.
Quick_Thinker: just more 7 minutes and then im ready to play :)
http://derpy.me/zVWJ7 Words escape me
ok anypony else wanna join us in Zombie Panic all you need is the half life engine and the mod and your golden
flutter_spin ...ew
flutter_spin: oh my...i should totaly not feel pleased by seeing that picture O_o
04<@Sumica> it's some what odd to get the random pm of "I cloped to your OC" <-- XDDDD
waht
flutter_spin: Milky.
flutter_spin: Clean them. With your mouth. Do et.
Yeah, and its not hidden on EQD either. Looks odd if you tell me
00,02xD Sumica
Ghosties: Not sure if he should be flattered or creeped.
Probably creeped.
SCP-173 creeped
XAX yeah creeped
not SCP creeped like first FEAR creeped
I can't draw, so it's better than anything I could make...
or maybe Slender man creeped
SCP-173 Vs Weeping angels : Who wins ?
/me has never played FEAR.
um thats a toughie sergio
Can the Weeping Angels see?
OmegaMetroidBrony: yes
04flutter_spin, are you talking about the chocolate Wonka thing with Vinyl and Octavia?
Weeping Angels as long as they don
but you cant look at them
*don't all blink at once
sergio_scriptor: SCP-173 probably :D
yeah
FEAR actually won me over with it's story, not the scary factor.
04Eh, it's borderline I guess
probably. I've seen worst
flutter_spin: Then you should play "RAGE" There is no fear. Only death.
I have a week of EQD to catch up on, heh
MadSurge: but the scp-173 is only one,there exists an army of weeping angels
00,02>calls design car
Ghosties: Do you haz a special somepony sir? Or an OC for that matter?
00,02>makes plane anyway
00,02dis will explode
yay
Ghosties: I've drawn about everypony here except you.
the scary factor only happeneed cause i played it when i was 10 (and then i learned pinkie pies song giggle at the ghosties and now nothing scares me except for ya know DEATH but ehhhh )
Ghosties: And so begins your nightly viewer interrogation segment :>
sergio_scriptor: you can smash statues, SCP-173 has no known method to be killed with yet
But 173 is immobile until you stop staring at it
woopity
hmmmm......
true but you will have to blink
cmon liftoff
MadSurge: indeed thought :) but the weeping angels not only snap the base of your neck like the 173,has they also teleport you thought time :)
04I do have an OC. Why, do you want to draw it? :o
more like draged down
Can someone explain this whole SCP thing to me? Im kinda lost on it.
Though I'd liek to see a SCP-173 v SCP-682 Deathmatch
Ghosties: Cause I have a mare sir that I love.
Quick_Thinker: put 5 guys on watch, the chances that all 5 of them will blink at the same time is pretty slim
um just type it in its a game
Ghosties: Her name is art.
Thank BUCK my mother has just left and I didn't have to suffer her presence. THankyou flying spaghetti monster. THANKYOU
yay its flying
Ghosties: I crave her.
00,02hmmm
00,02might be a smidge too heavy
nahh phase its totally fine XD
04That's...interesting, Liokin o_o
>w>
Oh hai Rain
XAX: scp-173 is a statue that kills people,and is only imobile when you maintain direct eye contact,the weeping angels are the same thing exept they are from doctor who
Ghosties: Like a preacher needs pain, like a needle needs a vein. I NEED TO DRAW.
Ghosties: You follow?
04Okay, Liokin, getting kinda creepy now ._.
:p
i like to draw but im terrible at it
sergio_scriptor: Right.
^
...
Liokin: a needle need a vein? Why not a thread?
/me ninja'd
i can't draw my OC of my own name for shit
ded
XD
I don't have an OC :3
Alchemist: Lol'd
dat splash
painiscupcake will eat you
OmegaMetroidBrony: You're not alone.
Ghosties: -lol Im just foolin with ya'. But link me your OC. I'll draw him/her
>w>
04I'll think about it, I'm pretty tired right now though x_x
"Might be too heavy. Better add more wings."
Ghosties: Too tired to copy paste? hmm....
GrimGallop: more wings = more lifting power
great idea phase add wings cant go wrong
Ghosties: fair enough. -lol
it's an XSADXYA wing now :)
Phase4: That thing isnt even gonna leave the ground XD
<--- Goes boom.
this looks like a mosnter plane
wait wait. Wave 3 has glow in the dark ponies?
Oh I'm totally checking to see if Toys R Us has them today
i wonder if anyone has thoguht of doing a fic of MLP FIM crossed with KSP
lol
I don't think it works like that. They aren't flapping. The engines pushing the contraption = lifting power.
this plane
00,02Liokin, ?
i want to see the splash again XD
it flies! just
oh my glob its working
Phase4: Oh my god XD
No one can stop~ the SMOOZE!
IMO it needs more wings.
IT FLIES?!?!?
Wow. It's actually kind of working. Kind of.
it... hovers
but for the ultimate test...... DO A BARREL ROLL!!!
it's falling
your gonna stall -lol
0_0
o.O
oh my...
spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace
or maybe not...
your gonna stall
TO VERTICAL.TO VERTICAL !!!
I don't even....
00,02hasent even put a dent in one tank
Phase4 just it have air intakes?
to the moooooooooon!!!!!!!!
00,02Mutterguy, nope
00,02and yet optimal airflow
00,020.97 efficency
ppffft
screw you chemistry!
Yay physics :D
how is this abomination flying
HOW
Quick_Thinker: magic ?
00,02Quick_Thinker, magic and blue pages
Pinkie Pie thats how
magic #snort snort#
and lots and lots of rocket fuel
what happened ?
00,02whoop
00,02seems to be running out of atmosphere
rocket fuel makes everything fly
....or explode
Mutterguy: you mean screw phyisics
this thing looks like its held together by sticky tape and tacks
lol
it is
lol
duct tape to be exact
Sundaysmile: put two bottles of cerosene in your pockets and see if you will fly.
Do a barrel roll!
even bettter
Duct tape fixes everything
I was thinking chemistry because that's what's involved in burning the fuel
cola and peppermint powerd
fuel's out
:O
plenty of fuel
backflip!
no atmo
and now its bucked in the flank
wooopity
/me plays Tom Petty Free falling
at least it OH COME ONE
BANZAI!!!!!!!
at least its going out in style
It's not falling,it's flying WITH STYLE
Phase4: pull up! pull up!
-lol
toy story 1
Mole mode activate. To the core!
Phase4 always flies in style.
DID HE SAVE IT
WOOOOOOOOOOO
Phase4 try and break the sound barrier!
dat barrelll roll
00,02Mutterguy, cant
The kerbals will live for another minute or two...
My bro just left for Comic-con
thats not a barrel roll
aww
And then everyone got icecream
can you break the sound barrier in this game?
thats an aeleron(*sp) roll
"IM GOING TO DO A BARREL ROLL,EVEN IF IT'S THE LAST THING I DO"
Quick_Thinker: you can break escape velocity, so yes.
i wish i could go to comic con although i am going to Canterlot Garden so its a fair trade
http://drupal.org/files/remiq.jpeg
Lol
i can never go anywhere dammit
Is that thing incapable of doing a barrel roll? XD
how the buck is this thing staying together seriously if i was flying the wings would allready be gone
i am stuck in the cave
Chrysalis: XD
Chrysalis: indeed.
it bugs me how few people know the difference
Chrysalis: just like few people know the difference between a clip and a mag
i know
take out that mountain!
i watched a video
i know the difference also didnt feel like saying a old meme
i forgot thou
its near out of fuel
Quick_Thinker: im finished downloading it,just send me an invitation :)

We landed... IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE!
00,02PonyNegZero, that is a point
Phase4: work on that...
00,10So basicly you turned on the sas and flew to the mountains till the ground curved up to you
lol

And now we get to watch Phase4 return to the airstrip in reverse...
there is still a chance for a 'splosion!
Lol

00,02Sumica, more or less
:O Too fast! Aaaaaaaaah!
lol its getting air

GO WRONG go wrong go wrong go wrong *shouts it over and over and over again*
:O
Phase4: You are under arrest for driving 300mph in a 55mph zone...
00,02this thing is incredibly unstable
It's a bird! It's Sumerpan! It's a Plane!
nah he is traveling 88mph :D
00,02PonyNegZero, you cant see my licence officer
00,10it's the angled wings

he can still smsh into tall buildings...
if there were any
Guys. It's 12:35am. Should I make toasties?
^
Velocity+Mass+Rocket Fuel + Mountain = Win
XAX: maybe :)
00,02you cant fly this thing without sas
XAX nothing wrong with mid-night toasties!
I'm still waiting to see this barrel roll happen.
00,10alrigjt, I am off to go make the dough
What ever happened to the Commander of Toast TRD?
Mutterguy: Cheese and pineapple.
Phase4: yes you can, you just can't fly for very long...
Have fun Sumica
unless you're pissed
Use the boost to get through!
/me nuzzles Sumica.
heh Sumica. I'm off to make real dough.. for pizza
Mutterguy: Sadly, no.

00,02PonyNegZero, i'll see what i can do
/me nuzzles Phase4.
/me 00,02hugs PonyNegZero back
derp
Wait... I just realised that Chrysalis said "Equestria is unlike any place I have ever encountered." That must mean that other lands are less full of love and harmony!
HOLY BUCK
Phase4: What do you do while stuff cooks?
:S Wtf
get ready to take a wing to the face DX
00,02wondering how to improve this
00,02XAX, whatever
Phase4: duct tape everything!
/me has a knife behind his backand asks any pony if they want to hug him
Phase4: That's helpful :<
Quick_Thinker: Hugging is uncomfortable.
/me hugs Quick_Thinker
/me hugs back
/me puts on a razorback and hugs Quick_Thinker.
this is not going to end well D:
its kinda of like the mario party mini game i roll th edice and see if i need to kill you :D

Seems to be gliding pretty well
any one else see that way point in the ocean?
Twilight Sparkle is obviously sleeping on the job and letting Pinkie Pie handle the Physics division
it's trying to splash attack
OmegaMetroidBrony: true statement is very true
is it riding ON the water?!
Has chat calmed down at all? ^_^
spartan133t: yep
It's a giant skimming stone!
if Twilight slept she would not sleep she has too many responibilities

huh no comments in the first min of my comment hmmm somthings off
if you'd give he nose a fuel tank and make it detachable and also replace the one jet there with two ramjets, you just might get into space
and now your bucked
i want to pilot that ship,it looks fun :)
3...2...1... Oh ship!
dude, how the fuck are you accellerating?
sergio it looks fun until well this happens
The passengers seem unaware if it happeneing
That sounded like an Earthbound attack sfx
except for good old jebidiah
land it! in the water!
that is if they kepy all the kerbal names
it COULD work
also, how are you accellerting without any engines=
00,02physics has better things to do
if i ever become a billionare im gonna do this in RL
Dark_Horst: Updraft.
Phase4: innnnndeeeed
Let TS sleep, she's tired... PP is doing a plenty good job...
^
i dont think ksp has something as complex as that
00,02perhaps i should just add a parachute
After all Twilight has two jobs iirc
parachutes are the easy way
00,02and struts
you're not going to wimp ou, are you?
00,02needs more struts
heck if i do become a millionare first plan is funding the hadron colider to find the hags boson and maybe some other things
Phase4: just add 'splosions
^
*higgs
Quick_Thinker: the higs bosson has been already found
Quick_Thinker: million is far far too short
okay then im funding the portal to Equestria HPPY
you should do that
00,02i can still accelerate this btw
Phase4: So how did you stumble on to pinkie pie technology? Ya' know defying physics and all.
00,02did it couple of minutes ago
Phase4: how? finflapping?
mornin' everypony, all good?
i have an equation that makes hable to create artifical wormholes,i developed it in my free time,do you guys want to see it ?
and it can happen just need to use some element and bam alternate dimensions are found ONE OF THEM HAS TO BE EQEUSTRUA
moin brony_swan
sure why not
i have an equation that makes hable to create artifical wormholes,i developed it in my free time,do you guys want to see it ? quick_thinker
00,02allmost had it
00,02Dark_Horst, yes
Quick_Thinker thats a bad idea if you've played Half-Life
sure
lolphhysics
00,02Liokin, someone else did
00,02thinking through my own design but this thing is prety well built
lol
i have played half life but fuck it i want Equestria more then i care about a alien race enslaving us
S=WH1.30 i developed this equation it makes hable the creation of artifical wormholes
:/
:O GENIUS!
it would be genuis if i understood what it meant
I guess the risk of being enslaved is worth finding Equestria
But what about.... the human taint?
not a scientist just yet
we just need to fix some variables and we got ourselves a portal TO EQUESTRIA :)
Phase4 Try playing Hittogata Happa. ^_^ It's hard as all hell.
ehh yah never kow the portal to Equestria could alter the body and make us ponys
Quick_Thinker: indeed it would
Good grief who's that plane designed for? Spider Kerbal?
it is sci fi after all we are talking about
Oh, and allo everypony.
Oh hai Meanwhile
hi Meanwhile
Quick_Thinker: by that same principle, would that make ponies into humans in the real world?
allo Meanwhile :)
Quick_Thinker: actualy no,it is not,some of this theorys are real
probely
MadSurge: yes it would
Hey Meanwhile!!!
lolphysics
hi Meanwhile
and who knows what it would do to our version of ponies
Pinkie Pie has everything under control
Phase4: lol is that even a rocket?
Nothing Twilight has to worry about
nope
OmegaMetroidBrony: of course, like always
00,02plane
where SAS is the egnine
00,02magic plane of no fuel
Phase4: O_O
00,02^ Dark_Horst
MadSurge:if we got a portal to equestria and we passed it,the other phisics of the equestrian dimension owould not handle our matter and particles,so the logic explanation is that they would change into common matter and particles from that dimension like ponies :)
00,02the engine is so i dont have to manualy start the thing
i am watching all the MLP FIM episodes on my DVR and i just got a call from the
WOAH
dat wall
00,02lets land in the mountians
get this motherfucker into orbit
I'd rather take Pinkie Pie over Rarity controling the Physics
"Let's land in the mountains" Famous last words.
00,02problem with this design
and what would rarity do with physics
sergio_scriptor: :D and become plastic ponies :D
they died in vain
00,02cant turn without accelerating
Similar to "Hey I'm gonna poke that bear"
this plane is so awesome, t's a rudderboat
or HEY IM ALIVE
She'd Get stressed trying to make them fabulous
OmegaMetroidBrony: Rarity would make physics absolutely fabulous
00,02"it has pointy teath, better poke it with a stick"
OmegaMetroidBrony: /)
laws of nature right there
or maybe i cant belive im alive
PonyNegZero: (\
MadSurge: nope :P we would become real ponies,you see multiverse tells us that nothing is fiction,somewhere out there exists a equestria just exactly like the same visual has we see it :)
Phase4: a stick with a grenade at the end of it... (only a sober man would throw it)
buck i think my chat bork
or not
http://www.a2armory.com/images/ww2/StickGren.jpg
Dark_Horst: potato masher~
Dark_Horst: the potato masher
dammed
Nice landing.
:O
i like how i broughtb up the idea of a portal to Equestria and now a scientific war has broken out XD
lol
sergio_scriptor: I got to see one of those at a military surplus
8/10
sergio_scriptor: sounds like a thing from the game "Total Distortion" :D
crash and burn / safe landing
RIP kerbals
Who besides Pinkie and Twilight should we trust with Physics?
You went in too fast and blew in about 2 seconds.
MadSurge:well it's not fiction it is real :) if you want i can opena private chat so i can explain a little better :)
OmegaMetroidBrony: discord!
they never rest in peace they get brought back to life just die some more
PonyNegZero: but couldn't you get the same thing out of Pinkie?
dsfhaif
sergio_scriptor: no, it was pretty clear like that :D
sergio if i may ask do you have a profession?
or are u in collage
college*
OmegaMetroidBrony: no, Pinkie still has a grasp on that kind of thing... Discord would make physics as reliable as religion... [joke]
Collage is a collection of images.
Quick_Thinker: nope,im still a student,but i was thinking taking a pHd in theoretical phisics
eh dont correct me
lol
Does it get your hackles up?
I'm conviced
though I don't think Celestia would approve
OmegaMetroidBrony: probably not
well sergio your a man/women of science as am i (but i plan on making video games in my future
Those rudders look like they're designed so the plane can do the can-can.
Quick_Thinker: good luck, you'll need it
i know
Quick_Thinker: hehe,thank you :)
Quick_Thinker: you're*
but i have great ideas
Quick_Thinker: again, good luck, you'll need it
Meanwhile correct me one more time and hug me
Quick_Thinker: well good luck to you too :)
i how in this game threre are fairly good physics but you can toatly break them
00,02theres method to my madness
That sentence hurt me.
Logic in Madness?
Meanwhile must you correct every pony?
00,02OmegaMetroidBrony, or is it madness in logic?
I see
Quick_Thinker: Yes.
00,02hmmm
00,02slower than the original design
okay than so menwhile hows yo dayz goins mins is goin just finz
The madness is he's doomed regardless, the method is to get everyones hopes up.
have fun
Phase4: do you think you could try and build an UFO for us ? just asking :)
That perfectly good sentence ruined
i gotta go bye everybody
bai FallenLegacy
Quick_Thinker: then* Meanwhile* how's* your* day* going* mine's* going* fine.*
bye FallenLegacy
OH COME ON
00,02sergio_scriptor, not realy any way to make circular things
00,02lol Quick_Thinker
Phase4: ha
00,02getting a little slow :P
:'(
no
i can think quick but i have to translate that thoguht into words by typing
*thought*
happy meanwhile
*thoughts*
Capitalise your initial letters and end on a full stop and I will be.
Guess I'll go with Ghosties' number now and watch episode 23...
I strangely think I can change the camera angle with the arrow buttons...
Also capitalise the first letter in names.
initial letters ahhhh buck you im not writing a fic right this sec its no big deal
OmegaMetroidBrony has the one keyboard to rule them all.
chues now?
grammar nazis are EVERYWHERE :)
Quick_Thinker: Apostrophe in I'm*.
Mwuahahahahaha!
oh shut up
Well, they didn't die that time.
*Oh shut up*
Too bad the plane snapped in two though.
Meanwhile: to soon ?
sergio_scriptor: Too*
Was that an explosion coming out of the parachute?
would there be a comma in that, after the oh?
Dark never post that picture again
Dark_Horst: indeed
why not? it's not a real insignia
00,02clearly i need more parachutes
Phase4: more duct tape
it dsays grammar, right there
Less flamable ones as a side note.
I don't like thinking of the nazis (my parents had jewish family members who well you can guess)
00,02i labled this one ded
00,02wonder why
PonyNegZero and Phase4 needs more MACGYVER !
Phase4: Because it died?
00,02oh yeah
Phase4: more duct tape... that is all
and more tacks
Oh this will not end well.
that looks retro-futuristic
00,02founds a bug
Like I said.
the buck is this tihngWOAH
Frontflip!
This one will end up in Keter Class.
:O
But MegaMoonShine that was a backflip.
WAIT 2 LIVED
megabackflip!
Da BUCK ?
Quick_Thinker: indeed!
Meanwhile: DON'T QUESTION ME! :[
Dat wobble.
XD
none lived
they see me slidin', they hatin'
sadly this type of ship would work on sci-fi tv shows
Flying in this craft, you have no chance to survive.
you shoulf playe the ear on the outer engines
*place the gear
Meanwhile: make your time
PonyNegZero: Ah ah ah.
00,02hmmm
:D
Needs more weight in the nose
/me laughs like a maniac
:P derp ship
OmegaMetroidBrony: http://www.nick.co.uk/shows/spongebob/images/stars/Squidward.png
Phase4 is on a roll with killing kerbals... (pun intended)
Meanwhile: :D
They lived that time! :O
not ded!
at least they survived
Perfect image Meanwhile :D
:3
Sumica: landing gear on the boosers and structural struts should help. they'll still be detachable
Dat balance.
cute
it like a baby :$
I'm giggling here at work...
Zoom on Squidward.
00,02oh yeah
Hahaha.
That is what I think it is.
that looks like the pod-racers from star wars ep 1
00,02POD RACER
Ugh! WoW is down for the next 4 hours....got nothing to do :'(
This cannot possbily go wrong.
RaveBrony: Don't die, dying is bad.
It's going to go wrong isn't it.
Let's see star wars logic in action
:o
^2
slight structural damage...
IT'S WORKING! IT'S WOOOOORKING!
holly crap star wars was right ! IT WORKS,the pod-racers THEY WORK :o
Awesome! :D
backflip!
'splode.
Except they don't have parachutes
But whatever
MegaMoonShine: :)
Mission Complete! Item Collection Rate : 100%
turning like a BAWS
actually, that looked more like one of those fighters from the phantom menace
