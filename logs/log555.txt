I'm telling him that it gives a LOT of knowlage to watch just a few episodes
my sister tells me to stay away from .mov's I don't understand why
ive seen the first 3 ep and a lot of fanficton
No, watch them in Haruhi order.
Now fluttershy's shed is starting to scare me
......
a series that had two different orders - actual chronological order was very different from broadcast order.
20 minutes left on the download, then i can go to sleep
and the two main characters argued over which episode was "next"
that's weird
*shrug* anime.

Not sure, though.

everyone just seems to hate wii
i like wii has metroid
Yes
i think Wii has the most fun games
Seriously, I'm a bit unsure.
Patience is a virtue that can only be obtained with time.
To be honest, I've lost interest in gaming recently
No his name is Link
But why is the series called Zelda, then?!
If you only control Link, I mean.
Because you rescue her all the time
Exactly my point.

My childhood was books.
Kill yourself now
theres nothing wrong with that
My middle school was nooks
My childhood was books and SNES
books
everyone has their tastes
and a Gamecube
My childhood was literally centered around books. I keep getting more and more books, but IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH BOOKS.
Oh, I wish.
I read the Twilight books in middle school
i dont like twilight....
i used to read books but i kinda of lost interest but i may have to pick that back up
The longest thing I've read was 240K words, and it was on FiMFiction

Speaking of the Lord of the Rings, I haven't read those in a while.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPLmGyq8CL0&feature=related I'm listening to this :p
I haven't read Lord of the Rings, but I watched the trilogy
for one of them
I saw it. Hoping to get some books soon.
Saw The hunger games, it was okay. Camera was too shakey at times though
Didn't like the film. She used the bow incorrectly at times.

A movie they killed for me was the Cirque Du Freak movie

if anyone here has read gaurdians of ga'hoole, i really disliked the movie
(sigh) I suggest the Demonota series or Cirque du freak
Remember it's all a show, keep 'em laughing as you go. Just remember that the last laugh is on you!

Kammerjuck I have never been one for favorite characters
there's nothing wrong with having a favorite. Even tho I don't really have one myself...
'S only natural, really.
I can relate to some of them more than others but I don't have a favorite
Rainbow Dash is one of my favourite fictional characters ever.
>Not prone to any condition

00,02ah, they are detatchable
(ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻
thanks
yes they did
:D
staging looks right, just don't forget to feed the fuel lines in.
00,02too bad you cant copy betwene designs
00,02already have rockets this would work on
That would be too easy
yeah, copy-paste staging would be nice.

Did not see that coming. It looked clean too
he ejected early
00,02Spectrum_Rush|Zzz, mun
00,02most rockets survive that
00,02but this one has tanks on lander

00,02dead straight
00,02like an arrow
Dont Stop, Belieeeeevin
i think
I'm watching the stream but I'm listening to blues right now as well :P
00,02hen3ry, when do you think the best time to turn for orbit is?
http://imgur.com/a/qUtL9#0
00,02XD
00,02burning a fair bit of fuel
It's Evil Enchantress.
If I'm going for minmus I don't turn at all. Just punch to 47,4 projected.
Problem is that I can't make that silly French letter on my keyboard.
Thanks
00,02not sure if enough fuel for this
You should still have enough. You have a full stack on that central engine.
plus the lander actually has more than you need by quite a bit.
even if you have to push the last bit to mun as a lander, you're fine.
3.5 tanks goes a long damn way with very low mass.
00,02hen3ry, thing is i'm lazy and dont aim
00,02enough to get me into mun intercept
it's pretty easy.
*THIS THING
orbit until munrise, punch full throttle at 90 degree orientation.
Right now you don't need any thrust.
Or a blunt axe?
*smash
hai guys
*Youtube
bad staging suddenly...
00,02well shit
00,02hen3ry, might try that next
270 collision course at Minmus, that lander can handle no prob. Not sure about Mun tho.
I think it can, but it takes longer, and that's a relatively weak engine
sorry about that i had to go pet my cat
00,02wow
00,02it has a lot of burn time
00,024 probably isnt
And you ejected nearly half it's fuel xD
00,02ikr
No kill like overkill
BOOM
*giggle* my hand is all tingly

thanks pinkies4yhwall
00,02hmmm
00,02forgot the fuel lines
00,02oh well
that's always something the astronauts like hearing mid-flight :P
?
you can move fuel from the outer tanks to the inner tanks (so the inner tanks are still full when you eject the outer ones)
oh noes
I'm guessing he's going to eject a lot fuel then?
It doesn't make that much difference really
*Moopy farts in the chatroom*
the rockets on the outer ones burn fuel faster
exuse me
04Oh, hello
hi there :3
I'm surprised however...
Hey
Heya Rainbow
hi Rainbow
Hi
hi Rainbow
hi rainbow
00,02go up
00,02den fall onto mun
00,02:3
Yes, but the extra fuel should have more than compensated for the extra mass.
Hey Rainbow :)
Hey
:D
*Hey -_-
Thanks?
00,02this thing has a ton of fuel left
inb4 surely you need to cut the engines though
04Hello 47
This is the first time ive been here.
Just sayin.
O.O
?
Hi.
I heard about this place but I never bothere going here :)
00,02Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, afaik no
00,02obvious software limits
it's a pretty awesome place in my experience
Watches You Sleep: http://i1100.photobucket.com/albums/g404/sub06905/lol.jpg
00,02brb
Guys get the cider
TAHNKYOU!
Cider!
I thought SCP-*** watched you sleep
Rainbow: let me tell you some of the rules :3
K
*song
/me Gives Rainbow a mug a of cider
:D
.mov is scary.
Hey rainbow is it ok if i hang out with you in clouds dale?
and moderatly creepy.
Also do not request Ponies
Go ahead.
Request Ponies?
04It's okay, just give an adequate warning next time ><
00,02did i see pony request?
when you ask whoever's streaming to show something
Yeah I would say that I would agree with you rainbow
04Phase, NO
Oh
I wouldn't
00,02k
He?
go on request ponies
00,02hen3ry, the stability is nice
ow my ears
Yeah, it's my go-to design for now. I just have to learn to get similar stability in a spaceplane/shuttle.
00,02hmmm
I have a few variations, but they're all similar.
00,02needs to start slowing much before periapsis
00,02not a lot of power on this thing
Nah, you're fine
I knew nothing! D:
This is my first time here.
Oh by the way rainbow fluttershy was just here a minute ago?
hes racing the moon!
00,02i have to land using those tanks
One cannot win in a race against the moon!
00,02o wait
00,02nvm
do not eject them.
00,02i forget how fuel works
04PHase is streaming, yes?
Yes
even if they empty do not eject :D
:0
Horror?
D:
^
and there we go, orbit get
Hey rainbow
Yeah?
00,02hmmm
047:00 PM EDT
20% cooler
00,02not sure how high to go during landing
00,02hen3ry, yeah
04No problem, Rainbow
on saturday, I mean
I often just float down.
00,02hen3ry, 40km good?
/me needs more coffee before he can do the brainy thinks
but on a darkside approach, yeah a partial orbit is needed.
GDI 5 am and still not sleepy :I
40km should be enough
D:
Oh no!
Spai keepin' me up at night!
:(
*excited
00,02sub06905, yup
Gentle men
Lol my parents dont care.
Cool
How do I subscribe?
Rainbow: to subscribe just ask a mod to give daily newsletter
Ookay.
00,02using a fair bit of fuel
Hey rainbow do you have a xbox elite?
00,02Rainbow, for the newsletter?
I have Yummi Nikki
Yeah, it does use fuel, but you have plenty for return. You should either just empty or have a bit left in the side tanks on touchdown
plenty for return
:D
click where it says Orbit, to change to surface display
I'm diggin the emoticons :)
04Not a problem ^_^
00,02hen3ry, drop speed now?
04OH
04That reminds me!
04I would do marathons of Marble Hornets :3
knowing where the damn ground is is the hardest part. :/
00,02i'm on a hill
00,02not too high though
00,02as long as i dont lose my engine
04A subject field is the bar right below the bar where you type in the address you're sending to
00,02hen3ry, at 8k drop to?
heh
Oh I get thanks!
This song reminds me of Metroid Prime 2 :/
at 8k, I try to keep speed below 100 m/s, and at 6 km, below 50.
You guys are really helpfull :)
00,02little fast
ha ha
Europony I think right?
http://i.imgur.com/jCrJx.jpg Most helpful
Ideally, below 2.
00,02uses shit all fuel
00,02can probably hover like this
:D
hai everypony. :#
:3
Do I have to say anything in the email Ghostie?
04Nope
K
...
Thank you!
04Just make sure you said Newsletter Subscription in the subject field
when landing view horizon
04You're welcome
he can't see it because he's busy landing..
Damnit I know the song but I can't place it
best music for Phase4's landing
00,02i'm liking this lander
K sent the email!
sucess
my landings tend to be far more explosiony
00,02hen3ry, my minimal lander can do this but its a pain to pilot
more than a tank, probably don't even need the ejection
00,02i blame the controlls
Yeah, the controls are weird, that's why I built wider
I don't need 3.5 tanks
Hey Is roleplay allowed? (not that i want to role play)
But I do need a triangle.
00,02well
00,02home time
Only during Maid Hour but only lightly
Okay cool
I can understand why.
00,02oh yeah
Maid Hour is back right guys?
Its like Superman all over again
00,02gona have to swing around the mun
xD
04Yeah, we really try to keep roleplaying down
04Oh, thanks Rainbow
:D
I want colored text :(
umm
was that suppost to happen?
those were empty tanks
00,02nice music
*parents
polar orbit.
00,02and polar orbit because why not
*chat
:)
Shame we didn't get to visit Luna on the moon :<
Stupid typos.

Its 7:15 pm where I am.
yup
its 5:16 over here
Lol.
00,02hell of an orbit
D
*:D
I'm here more or less
Hey rainbow stay with us for a while
I'll try.
I blame SCP's 087 and 173
00,02hmmm
otherwise it might recapture you
Evening all.
LOL
No.
04If you're easily scared, just don't go for it
Oh okay.
I ty[e with one hand
lol
tpye
Don't worry rainbow i'll buy you an apple cider its on me
hi Loopy :3
ya
forget it
yup
alright
04Thanks though
SomI dont think I can stand that.
00,02lol
*so I
00,02can re-enter mun orbit
You could.

I've done it by accident before
Then again I am a girl.
Honestly no scary games give me nightmares anymore. I'm immune
Here you go rainbow an apple cider
Braggy.
I cansleep still
and even when I do get nightmares, they don't really bother me much :P
I get nightmares about nothing in reality.
^
for some reason when i get nightmares i have the power to rewind my dreams lol
Probably shouldn't share this dream but oh well
I've thought about braking orbits might help tho.
^
Ii dreamt that I was in my home and I knew something was there I felt it's presence
Yeah.
Any one remember Camp (S)Laughter?
basically modern horror movies are just remakes, sequels, and copys of the old classics
Bagman
I sang to help me and she sang in her slept and I drifted to seep in my dreams
00,02wonder if joysticks work
Movies, can't.
00,02^ Rainbow
But it'd be the only way to really pilot without ASAS
Movies are mainly just jumpscares now-a-days.
Yeah I called him bagman but bunnyman does like the bunnies
00,02games are in a much more powerfull position to elicit emotions
/me Looks at clock
4:20 AM! :o
Nice.
cool
00,02for example, ever played deus ex?
We been having troubles with storms lately though.
00,02gala-gala-gala-gala
it is 11:21 in the moring here

04So then basically F.E.A.R.
but do you always dress in style?
O.O
ya
Sumotori Dreams anyone?
i do
ie, no solids attached.
Hey rainbow do you have a xbox elite
Rainbow: I got a 9 year computer how do you think I feal? :(

apollohoax. *facehoof*
a while back when my old computer broke, I was stuck with my ancient Pentium 2 for a while :P
It's pretty strong and tough for its type.
00,02Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, not at all
Lol
00,02hen3ry, ikr
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_VheAwZBuQ
00,02did link me to this though
00,02hen3ry, thats a point
00,02HEAVY YES
If I remember right, the insertion orbit to the Moon was a figure 8 shape.
:3
:D
Clowns are evil man
00,02Rainbow, :D
:D
00,02fun fact: i have one of those aol things here
00,02in australia
Five free hours....
00,02no clue how it got here but i have one
I used to have an AOL disc mobile.
The floppy disc is still in its packaging too :D
> use it for porn xD
...
Porn?
Um...
I am reborn!
:D
weighs about 10kg
wow nice.
Is it indestructible?
00,02they could dock
it doesn't work with the GSM grid, though
Throw it at things
Lol?
nah, it's shaped sort of like a briefcase with a phone attached by a cord
I have licorice all over my hands.
I have to type with two fingers.
i.e., hit a bullet with a bullet.
well not quite that bad, but still.
00,02so
00,02my launch plan was about the same
00,02orbit kerbin, transfer, orbit mun
00,02hen3ry, was a little tricky then yeah
Truly* lol
00,02so much easier
00,02theirs was like a wristwatch
and the one on the ship itself... actually I don't think they had an onboard.
it's really impressive how fast computers have evolved
Gonna shower now
00,02hen3ry, they had one
thanks rainbow
00,02realy early ttl machine
huh
00,02should see the memory cores
a Timex Sinclair.
Piece of history tight there
*right
sorry, wrong. Early 80s.
Still history
00,02dats it
a whopping 1k of memory.
It won't a stilysh marrige, I can't afford a carrige.
my brother got a Microvax 2 :P
00,02used flexible pcb
GDI 5.32 am and still no need to sleep...

Contract?
they are awesome pens, though :P
00,02seems that most of the computing was done on the ground
hmm
Considering most computers were the size of a room...
00,02hen3ry, i've heard that one, not sure if joke or srs
00,02the pen taht is
00,02that'
ಠ__ಠ

hi everyone
WHOOO WHOO WHERE?
Licorice > Pepper seeds and Popcorn Kernals
^
:D
popcorn kernels are pure evil
^
But they ar edible :(
*are
Edible Evil
Baked Bad?
00,02cant realy use their orbits
00,02or anything realy
I'm pretty sure popcorn is out to kill me
00,02n-body problem is more important than i thought
^
But still edible.
and Evil
/me ／人◕ ‿‿ ◕人＼ Contract? I can make miracles happen.
And Colored popcorn?
FUCK YES
00,02i'ma add weight to this and try for a minmus/mun flight
Never had that either but I'm pretty sure they're just as evil
00,02[wklmjhe]JRP2234, : D
sudden music
Rainbow: did you watch all of season 2? :D
Rainbow: I know, but still. Ew.
Yes.
Why wouldnt I?
:((
00,02hen3ry, my plan for this is to attach a lander when they add docking
00,02so i'ma try mun->minmus flight
Oh woaw.
Rainbow: I had to push the chick that made me watch ponies to go on watching season 2 :D
Looking at that ship, my concern would be "back home"
00,02not sure if use this one or bigger one
Lol.
00,02hen3ry, it can make it
Ouch man
00,02it'll be fine
00,02i have parachutes
She got you into it and didn't want to watch S2....
Finished showering
Wait is the stream to the left Live?
Yes
00,02has bigger rockets
Cool.
00,02but i hate the way it looks and no srb's
Nice
not that landing works yet. :/
Heh :D
00,02those extra two tanks are to simulate the weight of a lander
K
Okay.
00,02i forgot how slow this one launches
Isnt that construction a bit assymetric?
lolololol
Its a few secounds delayed that vid.
Lol I dont care.
:D
00,02perhaps a 3rd row of srb's
Kyuubey hacked a Philippine government site
Good Sergio!
I don't like SRBs... they don't really add much
00,02they add a bit
Its okay.
00,02and this thing CaNNOT launch without it
00,02yeah, realy need longer burning srb's
Dunno about that...
I think Luna14 has a couple SRB stages to get off the damn platform.
But I don't like it xD
Omg LMFAO
:D
Best pun Ive seen in Mounths.
/me is a pungeon master
:)
:D
That shower felt great
:$
I should probably shower and head off to the store soon myself... but I'm lazy
Lol.
^
Is it difficult?
K
00,02well
00,02that didnt work as expected
I would play it if i could.
Rainbow: you can also not care and make exploding rockets :D
00,02those tanks are suposed to stay on but whatever
Rainbow: it's free :)
staging or just broke off?
dat spin
WOOO
00,02hen3ry, staging
KSP looks addicting.
00,02they were suposed to stay on and simulate a lander in weight
00,02Rainbow, is a bit
GDI I'm now obligated to stay awake till 10pm this evening
:D
Hit 6 am
GDI? Global Defense Initiative?
:D
00,02i could have sworn this thing had more fuel
lol
brb Grabin edibles (that isnt anything to do with corn kernals)
Rainbow: stick around, you're gonna hear quite a lot of pony remixes/original songs
fraid knot
Midwest/East Coast here
00,02hmmm
00,02need to add more tanks later
00,02and mabey change engines
And now Noctural

Rainbow: older or younger sister?
Older :3

00,02sergio_scriptor, thats the plan
Oh yes... elder siblings... Awesome at times and annoying at others
00,02go for minmus or mun first?
Same goes for younger ones
/me is the elder sibling
My sister that gave me the food Is my secound older sister
00,02sergio_scriptor, k

Uh oh...
00,02eh

00,02meh
00,02inexact orbit
00,02good enough
Lol
you know... people are allowed to no like ponies, everyone has different tastes...
^
00,02might straighten it up a little then trasfer to minmus
00,02somehow
cooking lunch at 5am. Seems legit
that transfer is gonna be a mess. I'm not quite sure how to pull it off efficiently.
TO THE MOON^

04Yeah, we have an auto kick to prevent message spamming
Rainbow: don't do that :D
00,02from here i could drop a lander
Damn me and my tiny sentences.
00,02land
00,02then re-join
Welp.
00,02sergio_scriptor, plenty
00,02~3 to 4 tanks worth
My heair feels greazy.
:3
my hair feels... beard
Rainbow: shower more often :P
My hair feels, chocolate
I need to shampoo more.
Rainbow: lol
My hair greases easily.

Chocolate rain.
Some stay dry and others feel the pain.

Call Of Duty? its all aboot Battlefield :$
00,02hen3ry, little help here?
I like both COD and Battlefield
Australia
I only TF2 :p
Nah it's all about the pirated emulators and pony
Er... you need to get down to the plane of Minmus' orbit...
:D
not sure if that's north or south from where you are currently.
Easturn Austalia.
00,02yup, G'day mate
:D
00,02hen3ry, i have no clue how to change the ecintriciyt of an orbit
00,02Rainbow, victoria
I find that I am random.....squirell
if you're in the equatorial plane, burn at either 0 or 180
Wait... Eastern australia aint a state!
Oh
if you're not... have to adjust slightly
I didnt say t was a state.
I was just narrowing it down lol :d
brb Need more EDIBLES.
I have relatives in Australia :o
Aztec in America
jk
partially
00,02time warp time
BEWARE
did you burn 90 or 270?
00,02this might take a while
Let's do the time warp AGAAAIIIIIIINNNN!
Pulling a Dr'Hooves
00,02hen3ry, i burned in about that direction
90 or 270 tho
00,02i cant relate the naveball to directions yet
it matters a lot
O.O
04You like marshmallows, Rainbow?
I'm eating Marshmellows.
:D (le trollface)
Rarity on a stick
/me Hasen't ate a marshmellow in a long time
00,02lol
00,02i'm gaining on minmus at 20 meters a second
yup
this could take a while then...
Is the night in the act of doing?
I just realised.
My food usually ends up in a tortilla
Someone need to make a Rarity Mane and stick hat onto a Marshmalow... and make a pair of eyes
Rarity cant be made of marshmellows.... I actualy like marshmellows
:D
00,02stupid orbit
00,02280m/s
00,02wonder if i can turn around and go backwards
to go faster than Minmus, you have to be inside its orbit.
00,02hen3ry, yeah
kfc= too greasy

You made a Pinkie Pie
the wing thinks it's a shark XD
00,02whats next on the list
00,025 more imposible things and i get a free lunch
00,02XD
and become a lollipop
00,02PonyNegZero, i'll try
00,02cant make any promises though
LOL

00,02wondering how to improve this
00,02XAX, whatever

MORE COWBELLS!
^
HERE WE GO
ITS WORKING!?
needs more Yaw control!
wooooooooooo
it kind of works,good
O.O
XD
is that a piece of a ship in the ocean
Seems to be gliding pretty well
any one else see that way point in the ocean?
if Twilight slept she would not sleep she has too many responibilities
o.o
HAAAAAAAAX!
Pony's gotta sleep sooner or later
In the shape of a plane ofc :D
i live in USA (even though no one asked )
to be more specifie Indiana
No one cares that I live in Ireland Waaheeey
finnaly
Oh hai you enjoying the drought or is that just Ohio getting it?
00,02how's that for a flight
to be even more specifc Lafayette
amazing
:'(
i give no bucks if someone wants to try ot hunt me down
good to know
...
<.< >.>

0423
oh yeah zps XD

3.141592
he didn't say integer
lol
I was wondering if you were getting any damned rain
somebody stop this madness!
00,02hmmmm
Not fun in the heat
O.O
youll need more engines for this one
...
lol
or.... nit?
It's workiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing!
and i was outside during 4th of july i was in that place damn people got bucked up from the heat
...i'll have to remember that design
00,02SAS POWAR
the flight is kind of decent actualy
00,02ok
lol
lol gone
You know, the mod (I think).
it rained on the 4th of July in massachusets
:/
The rear end is like "Fuck this shit!"
I swear this area has some kind of drought plague on it
lol
:'(
bye guys
9.5/10
if you
Drop the Sky Anchor!
huh no comments in the first min of my comment hmmm somthings off
i want to pilot that ship,it looks fun :)
3...2...1... Oh ship!
dude, how the fuck are you accellerating?
sergio it looks fun until well this happens
The passengers seem unaware if it happeneing
except for good old jebidiah
it COULD work
also, how are you accellerting without any engines=
^
i dont think ksp has something as complex as that
00,02perhaps i should just add a parachute
After all Twilight has two jobs iirc
parachutes are the easy way
00,02and struts
you're not going to wimp ou, are you?
00,02needs more struts
heck if i do become a millionare first plan is funding the hadron colider to find the hags boson and maybe some other things
^
*higgs
you should do that
00,02did it couple of minutes ago
mornin' everypony, all good?
and it can happen just need to use some element and bam alternate dimensions are found ONE OF THEM HAS TO BE EQEUSTRUA
sure why not
00,02allmost had it
00,02Dark_Horst, yes
sure
lolphhysics
00,02Liokin, someone else did
00,02thinking through my own design but this thing is prety well built
lol
:/
:O GENIUS!
I guess the risk of being enslaved is worth finding Equestria
it is sci fi after all we are talking about
Oh, and allo everypony.
probely
lolphysics
Pinkie Pie has everything under control
Nothing Twilight has to worry about
00,02plane
00,02magic plane of no fuel
WOAH
dat wall
00,02lets land in the mountians
get this motherfucker into orbit
I'd rather take Pinkie Pie over Rarity controling the Physics
"Let's land in the mountains" Famous last words.
00,02problem with this design
they died in vain
00,02cant turn without accelerating
Similar to "Hey I'm gonna poke that bear"
She'd Get stressed trying to make them fabulous
laws of nature right there
or not

dammed
Nice landing.
:O
lol
8/10
RIP kerbals
You went in too fast and blew in about 2 seconds.
dsfhaif
sergio if i may ask do you have a profession?
or are u in collage
college*
Collage is a collection of images.
eh dont correct me
lol
I'm conviced
though I don't think Celestia would approve
i know
but i have great ideas
00,02theres method to my madness
That sentence hurt me.
Logic in Madness?
00,02OmegaMetroidBrony, or is it madness in logic?
I see
00,02hmmm
The madness is he's doomed regardless, the method is to get everyones hopes up.
have fun
That perfectly good sentence ruined
i gotta go bye everybody
OH COME ON
00,02sergio_scriptor, not realy any way to make circular things
00,02getting a little slow :P
:'(
no
*thought*
*thoughts*
I strangely think I can change the camera angle with the arrow buttons...
Also capitalise the first letter in names.
chues now?
grammar nazis are EVERYWHERE :)
Mwuahahahahaha!
Well, they didn't die that time.
Too bad the plane snapped in two though.
Was that an explosion coming out of the parachute?
would there be a comma in that, after the oh?
why not? it's not a real insignia
00,02clearly i need more parachutes
it dsays grammar, right there
Less flamable ones as a side note.
00,02i labled this one ded
00,02wonder why
00,02oh yeah
and more tacks
that looks retro-futuristic
Like I said.
Frontflip!
:O
WAIT 2 LIVED
megabackflip!
Dat wobble.
XD
none lived
they see me slidin', they hatin'
sadly this type of ship would work on sci-fi tv shows
you shoulf playe the ear on the outer engines
00,02hmmm
:D
Needs more weight in the nose
/me laughs like a maniac
:P derp ship
They lived that time! :O
not ded!
at least they survived
:3
Dat balance.
cute
it like a baby :$
I'm giggling here at work...
00,02oh yeah
Hahaha.
that looks like the pod-racers from star wars ep 1
00,02POD RACER
Ugh! WoW is down for the next 4 hours....got nothing to do :'(
This cannot possbily go wrong.
It's going to go wrong isn't it.
Let's see star wars logic in action
:o
^2
slight structural damage...
IT'S WORKING! IT'S WOOOOORKING!
Awesome! :D
backflip!
'splode.
Except they don't have parachutes
But whatever
Mission Complete! Item Collection Rate : 100%
turning like a BAWS
actually, that looked more like one of those fighters from the phantom menace
