Mostly pointing out that Epic Movie probably didn't deserve WMC even though it was trite and thoroughly crap. Dari is right, it was actively trying to be "so bad it's good" and just failed. That's not as bad, to me, as trying to be good and failing THAT badly. >_>

0,5^Perhaps the weekly reports could done in spreadsheets?
strange.

and yep
LOL
ikr
Can't imagine why.
!cd

I think Rarity was just about to say something Unlady like when she held her breath there
But she does go to the Hospital.

That was a good episode.
It's a mystery
Next week.

Spikes Bday?
SUBARASHII

I expected to be disappointed...but not this way
fine
Which is this now?
10,02The second idea relates to warnings/bans.
she really likes books
04I'm also assuming the reports would go straight to admins?
i'll make my own interwebs if ACTA passes
wati
Oh....Oh...of course reshelving day.....
This was a good episode, but probably one of my least favourite :I
Spike man.
A heart container?
Rarity threatens RD, RD eventually ends up in hospital..
Would that be an accurate descriptionj?
o this one
then let's watch back to the future 2....everybody likes back to the future
Spike's gonna evolve!
Spike MAD.
Conicidence? I think not.
spike the conisure
thought it was lesson zero
you can AGE a ruby?L
That's the thing when you name anything "Modern" - it's still got that title a hundred years later.
Well the Modern Era of literature runs from 1920 to 1947 roughly
yea Y U NO
lol
Zolga was an imposter, also have a nice day everyone :3
I'm going to be on next week at 10.
everything else is PostModern
10,02They could, but I was also thinking they could be public on the forums in their individual topics.
spike's birthday is the same day twilight becomes celestia's apprentice
That's the best way! ^_^
=P
07,01public ?!
yeah
but magic

Spike's gonna evolve...
1,3us-public, not public-public
LOL!
Nice, kira.

07,01^
I'm going to guess she falls or messes up a trick.
How tragic for you.
Something to that affect.
atleast 20
8,1wait a minute
...
why would you hate rarity :(
today we hate flim and flam
Maybe she's just sick.
Sad for YOU!!!
Rarity might have a little Rouge the Gem Stealing Bat in her
Never know =P
20%
gems are extremely common in equestria
yes it is
:F
Swagg
yea
no Spike dont!!
Saturn: You're right :o
Well, Rarity can find gems. Rouge has to steal them.
0,5What if someone was assigned with doing reports?
smileyfaise
11,01And Rarity cons Spike out of his present.
i would stick my horn in rarity
Here comes Spike's Y U NO face.
nooooo
I didn't think about that

Rarity gains another Health Point

>element of generosity
That was epic.

OK. As far as Spike is concerned, it's a fair trade.
for real
never was again!
At least Rarity doesnt use it for a dress design...Generousity!
>Rainbow Dash

04If you're suggesting having weekly reports by the departments, then I think it's only fair that the admins go over them accordingly
lol
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGSX03xzJc4 << The BGM that plays in my head when Spike starts to go full Greeed mode
Pinkie is best pony.
Pinkie Broke the 4th wall
I'm awesome haha
yes yes she is
lol RD bought him weights
Not at all
04I wouldn't mind having the other departments taking a look for communication, but all of the decisions should ultimately come down to the admins
Dumb book

And then nothing sexual happened
8,1prince-dari: same thign can be done with gdocs

I don't need to use sockets or anything for this.

I stop lurking and see 'wang fire'
Hmph!
It, too, is canon.
i want to see derpy episode
harrumph
its canon
9There is a huge problem with the schedule system, and thus, I would like to impart personal experience of my own
derp
derp
YOU'RE NOT THE BOSS OF ME
I luv this episode
6_9
you mean the last roundup
RTS?
nope.avi
that was earlyer today
*snow*
*plays malcom in the middle themesong*
still
Humans can learn ALOT from ponies...
can you put it on
Didn't turn out well
it was an utter disaster
Derpy was canon until they actually called her Derpy.
>Juss saying.
Real Time Strategy=RTS
That horse sound
Cry mich ein river.
poor fluttershy
you mean non canon?
^
13SuperBrony64: would a turn based be okay?
whos putting the videos on?
fluttershy in that armour = epic win
lol
fos ro dah!!!!
Perhaps I'm confusing myself.
9my end conclusion was that it was pretty much impossible to hold a schedule, even if it was set for hours I THOUGHT I would be available...
1 sec
Define Canon.
>.>
9in the end there is always the possibility that whomever is in charge is not going to be able to make it
lol wut
>Fail attempt to see if I was using it right.
Ask pinkies, she has lots of parptay ones
This episode proves that humans can learn ALOT from ponies...
Writers made it, etc, etc.
Got it.
^
0,14FUND IT
Rarity is dramaqueen
04Yeah, a streaming schedule is just way too restrictive
Non Canon.
9however
tell her or him to put the last roundup on
I like the music in this episode
/me 13scribbles in her ideas book
Derpy was actually *fanon*
Think inside the chimney.
I think inside a chimney
9there is another thing that can be done, not just exactly a SCHEDULE...
Somebody fund Fighting is Magic to make it release faster
OHHH
Now I get it.
1,3huh?
Face.
Not much of a difference, but it's arguable.
Told
BRILLIANT!
dawwww
put on the last roundup
please
I cannot Think inside a chimney....:( I have no chimney
on here
same
00,10pony civ for civ 5
1,3you can link it for him, yeah
9set certain times every once in a while in which a streamer is ABSOLUTELY SURE can make it...and if they can't, someone else can take over for them
Or you could.. you know... eat that hat..
lol!
9but yes, a normal, regular schedule would never stand
Desktop Ponies has lots of sprite-like graphics.
ja
We need to gather the top scientists of the world and develop an offline virtual equestria and an online one
00,10fluttershyfan158 go look up desktop ponies
DAA'
9I can tell you from experience
13but... i can't fund it
13i have no money..
Thundersnow
Darn net burp.
thx derpington

/me funds Shizuka's funds.

AVATAR STATE Lol
And stairs.

KEEP HATING
YES
Fluttershy hates Rainbow Dash.
/me looks at his paws. "Not sure about the impossible part there."
Stickin' with Cessnas.
Heart piece
0,14An addendum I'd like to propose if perhaps having a back-up streamer (which could work on a rotating system) ready in case the schedule streamer couldn't make it
Why aren't you hating
Now Canon.
HAX!!!!!
=D
Freindship saves the world yet again
How could this happen?
Poor spike.
unicorns are the aristocracy
HAHA
i like trains...
thats 3 times
*facehoof*
*the best
xD
But...
04As long as you're not trying to set up some kind of stream schedule
SPIKE YOU PASTA
04Because that shit just won't fly
/me is hit by train
/me 11,01dies of melted heart.
Didn't Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy sleep with eachother?
hahaha
And they died from melted hearts.
....
fluttershy and rainbow dash just brohoofed
1,3sounds more like a notification than a set schedule
O_e
mein gott
Wahoo.
equestria!
I Like Trains
all rise for the national anthem
theypredicted celestia and luna on their flag?
and that's how equestria was made!
It's a Creation Myth
/me loves this song
ya know
07,01Merry x-mas
xD
fluttershy can see the future
^
that is how
AGAIN
where did celestia and luna come from
That scene always lost me.
Merry Malcolm X-mas to you too.
It's like the Founding of Rome
10,02Otherwise we might as well just move on if it's not going to happen.
/me cheers
Faust says that that's meant to be a mystery.
sounded as real as 300
0,5That could attract more viewers...
Those are pretty modern..
:D
I was talking about cars...
I never got that scene, it was just them looking down for a second, and then Fluttershy blushing.
Means they have a plastic industry
1,3maybe set up a feed or twitter to announce when streams start up?
Windigo: Rooooaarrr!
but the subject randomly changed somehow
Which means the drill for petroleum.
the haters are bac D:
*Back
Windigo's exist.
lol
haters are hating
10,02Hmm, that's not a bad idea ^
Plaestic
nananananna
Windigos are out there.
Wait.
Where are the drilling rigs?
Damnit you were supposed to keep hating
That means Gas is coming next?
and then.. after they finally found peace
xD
night everyone ^_^
yfw that wasn't the Windigos, that was me after watching Mare-Do-Well
we never see any oceans
not sure if me or not everytime i see it
I'd say it means they already have it.
Which confirms cars.
CANON
YES
its night here
^_^
see you all :P
Gnight everypony~
We have done a great thing today, friends.
00:08
Just saying.
Windigos: You hatin' yet
Ferraris and Mustangs

:D
To be honest I'm still not really for it.
anyone
Mane 6: Nah just a minor argument...
No movie, then?
2x03!
Oo
11,01Good idea.
04And actually, we already havea twitter
Can you explain that scene to me?
04*have a
choose anything
Windigos: Well... ... you hatin yet?
I really don't get it >.>
babysitting episode
Yea.
Why would you suggest that.
do season 1 ep 16

Rarity and Fluttershy compete for best hair
I know, but I haven't seen that one yet
wich episode are we on
!cd
?
woot woot
oh lord trixie
/me cant wait for read it and weep
the great and pwoerful trixie!!
trixie!
YESSS
xD
Boast Busters
yes !
oh
omg
Gentlemen
trixie? out of here.
MUSTACHE!~ :D
Night everypony.
i hate trixie!!
epic moustache
i think
07,01yep, she does
i watched this ep several times
10,02Well, the issue is if she's the only one on it and she's not around, then it can't be updated.
IT'S SPINES SPIKES EVIL BROTHER
trixie may be a showoff
Dat moostache.
romeo 0_0
but she is püretty epic
daw
Twilight finds Spike attractive.
aw rats
Canon.
11,01We can't tie the Twitter to a feed?
Trixie needs to return, with legit magic this time
11,01Or use a common account?
italian intro is best intro
His moustache has experienced more than a lesser man's entire body..
Twilight finds Spike attractive.
Canon.
I do like the fanfics that promote Trixie as a legit Magi
instead of a two-bit hustler
actually spike wanted the moustache to woo rarity, hence 'romeo'
04Maybe if others would like to use the twitter?
inb4 trixie and twilight rematch
that opening is soo METAL
10,02I wouldn't mind updating the Twitter.
8,1i'm back
Do you guys think the Dodge Ram would sell well in Equestria?
math is a talent?
Trixie has capable, decent magic. SHe's just prone to exaggeration... and is unaware of who's got the REAL power.
Mai talluntt eez Magikz
Idk. they seem to get around pretty well.
*Insert trixie*
Mai talluntt eez Magikz
11,01Watch in awe as I turn this channel 180 degrees!
A fanfic Idea of mine gives Trixie the ability to COPY Spells.
cutting ability?
Dat blush.
AWW YEAAAAAAAAAAAAA
lol somepony's alittle full of herslef
yawn
SHOWOFF!!!!
pppft
actually Twilight has the canon ability to sufficently analyze magic and reproduce it
someone told me it was spelt tricksy
unless it's something stupidly complicated
or it aint a show
Fireworks is now magic
07,01okay shall we move on?
good old speaking in the 3rd person
OK... that makes a sort of sense.
1,3Trixie has a lot of fanon
best excuse to run away
if oyu go to the circus
"I.. I.. I.. Moustache!"
lol
07,01Embed switching (SB)
its just.. meh
terrible pun
Cars are canon now?
haters!
lol
10,02Alright
when are they ever good?
As per the earlier episode
die, trikie's haters!
I challenge TG&P Trixie to a pokemans battuhl
trixie's*
I dunno. I thought it was Punny. :D
"I...I- Moustache!"
>:xc

<3333
XD
must be strong
T-T
i just thought of something epic!!
brb guys i need to... umm... Moustache!
Trixie comes back and learns how to leverage her illusion and show powers and not be a colossal douche at the same time
/me 13pokes nittany in the side with her horn
13poke~
Trixie
yep she sure is
RD is best pony
11,01Ow.
Speaking of which.
heya Luna

07,01haiiiii
RD wins
13canary~<3
11,01Shizuka, watch where you put that thing.
Hiya Luna!
hahaha
Of the mane 6? I dunno.
anything you can DO
can you bake a pie?
CHALLENGE ACCEPTED
trixie is now a sideshow for a carnival
¬_¬
Oh Trixie.
:1
brought my total sleep up to 19h >_<
wait
there's a NO EPISODE
that's why I like Ponies Reharmonized Trixie, it's a nice peice of fanon that makes it where Trixie is such a self-aggrandizer because he is the middle child out of 5 near-identical fillies and was entirely average at every field of magic
13where?
Fleur i don't think it is an ability
NO YOU CAN'T :P
I can srand up :3
right there
0,5I could help out too with that, if really needed.
xD
10,02(I would like to actually help with that)
8,1or maybe allow all streamers to update the twitter
*noticed
I would have given her a mustash
Done...turned out quite well.
Trixie annoys me :/
11,01Ok.
yeah
11,01That's nice.
8,1or have a seperate "what we are streaming at the moment" twitter, that also serves as a mini stream backlog
I can't remember the song proberly
11,01Get off of the stage.
xP
13^
oh ye of little faith
plus I can't type for shizzle tonight
8,1i could integrate that into the site no problem too
13among other things when someone starts a stream, i'll get to that when it's my turn
but it isn't good
11,01I could do the Twitter.
Guys, shout out when you see Derpy.
precisely my problem with this
11,01Oh, nvm.
She was in the crowd a minute ago.
trixie cant do a sonicrain boom
Interior Crocodile Alligator
0,5Several of us want to help the twitter, heheh.
HNNNNNNNGG
(I drive a Chevrolet Movie Theatre)
<Dat Dash
I saw her
top right of the croud
I'm losing my mind.
she didnt beat rainbow dash! She humiliated her
Soon I'll be talking to the wallpaper again.
Nnope.
she didnt do the same thing
D=
RARITY :D <3
i know
Bitch, Please.
3rd person
xD
Pinkie would break Trixie's magic
LMAO!
8,1actually, i think it's only admins at the moment
13yep
lol
"But rarity conducts with gace"

Madbro.Jpg
; w ;
buut
13but also either saturn or i are going to make a plugin for wordpress to make that easier
she cheats
8,1sb, this is somethign that'll be different in BS2.0
( she just let trixie get the best of her, didnt she? ) :P
Well, I never..
khaki hair?
lol
LOL
Sheesh.
T_T
11,01Yeah. It would be nice if more ops had control of the stream.
this is the worst possible thing ever!
For BS 2.0
umad
Come at me, sis.
10,02That would be great to have as well
10,02^
Eeyup.com

I like Trixie.
*shoots Trixie with twin rail guns*
Snails = derp

Epic website.

Now you see, why didn't they get offended by Snails and his dopy voices and whatnot.
goodnight guys
07,01none?
Oh silly Fleur xD
Best site on the interwebs.
OMG
07,01okay moving on then
GRIFFONS ARE BUNGHOLES!!!
That is epic
oh you
I watched him saying that
Then,
good night arrow
9,1just putting it out there. Go on.
*facehoof*
bungholes... hehe...
/me coughs
And I'm like.
8,1that could be done by polling the server every, say, 30 seconds; but that means at high load times we'd have, for example, 5,000 requests every 30 seconds, on average
...
Spike. He should be a lawyer.
I LEIK PUDDING :3
ok..sry
pudding :P
I like pudding. LOL
=D
sigh... oh spike
Or um....other ends
10,02What?! Why don't they sell fleas?!
Then having a button on the stream panel
o.o
OBJECTION.
That too.
Saying 'refresh'.
ugh
Let's go back to proving random things. LOL
IDK if u DK
Well he has a point.
(S2E10 not withstanding)
Okay
they do sell fleas. they just dont advertise thatthey are there
K
Agreed
Hey all.
heyo random
*points at rainbow dash*
We made good progress with the whole cars and natural gas argument..
nopony jim..nopony..
Yep.
Lets continue.
07,01one can never have ENOUGH ponies
need moar evidence.
Yes let's
Someone needs to write this down.
It still means telling them they have to press the refresh button of course, but they don't have to refresh the page.
:)
She can spontaneously create matter. I'm not certain CELESTIA can do that.
And put it on EQD or something.
My point exactly.
oh wait
I don't have any pape-...wait a minute
Stars live in caves?
Derpy Boys :)
Spaaaace
+a
FALCON KICK
Stars live in Caves, Bears must live in the sky.

lol
They're a little Derpy, these two.
000 isn't very good at telling us how much of the bandwidth limit we're using either.
No.
=D
If you've used something like 80% they send an email, but you can't find out any other way
Nice...
Lol
o.o
07,01that's odd..
8,1prince-dari: that's somethign i want to bring up in the tech meeting too
Also, Snails is best pony.
Gah, she never refers to herself in the first person, does she? ;)
Snails is derpy
Trixie's homeless
Now they've met
/me really thinks the design of the usea minor is awesome.
Was that a Jurassic Park Reference? with the trees falling over by an unseen force? Nice!

ugh

:(
I wanna say it again
HUHUHUH, AYE LAEIK PUDDING!
i never understood why one would do that

Trixie: I am a Show Magic Unicorn not a Magi Unicorn D:

Stars live in caves, therefore Bears live in the sky.
Canon/

Not to be critical-- but those two are MORONS.

Rainbow Dash always dresses in style~
2,14 that one's really simple, and already taken care of (mostly)
Hm...
What's it meant to be addressing?
This one is pro.
G3 Rareity was REALLY scary

11,01Mixed.
ik
granny smith is getting trolled
the south field
exactly
challenge accepted
04But the quality is phenomenal
Well, they should talk to Filthy Rich.
ikr
hehe
alright it works
8,1and should we look into setting up our own streaming server instead?
that would make it fair
ALSO
We have
04It's unfortunate that I may have to get adblock, but I'll manage
ISN'T THIS THE THIRD APPLE EPISODE IN 4?
We represent Pizza Dinosaur...
It's not practical.
i dunno, Filthy Rich seems to have some ties to the Apple Family
more pinkie
^^^
<3
more trixie
Zap apple, Apple rodeo and this
lol
GO APPLE FAMILY! Go!
10,02:3
The quality was no where near as good as with the online streaming services we use
That's HER name!
yeah
07,01^
05,15why couldn't people get adblock plus though, I got it in the middle of movie night and never had another issue
more fluttershy
8,1prince-dari: i'm thinking more a dedicated solution, but i'll talk more about the 'how's in the tech meeting
Dat hour glass!!
Agreed!
8,1i'm just asking should we look into it
the timelord :D
shit just got real
We have though
which is Stare Master
their bodys are ready
8,1because it's perfectly possible, but there are some other considerations too
And if it involves money it's a no-go too.
lolwut
because they arent aliens
^
07,01^ dat depends
Trolled
8,1prince-dari: that's somethign i'll come to in a bit; but i may have a solution taht solves those problems
Hey there!
Because we stream copyrighted material the chances are we'll pay for a service and then lose it.
*trollface*
07,01but let's talk about it during the tech meeting
lol
all the faces this episode were awesome
Yes
8,1yeah, that was really leading into my next point
Goggles mean srs bsns
lol
And I'm pretty sure earlier on we decided it wasn't worth that risk when the free providers are alright.
another applejack one?
hello
oh yea
and ive gotten about sick of applejack
Yeah
3rd one in 4
nvm
accept for the last one
derpy was the acception
How are you?
yeah =P
derpy stole the show
i'm good
the cavalry have arrived!
this part made my heart melt a bit
no complaints
8,1anyhoos, my next point is two things, really
me too
exactly
:P
Cockiness is a definite flaw in Equestria.
srry checking my facebokk
Same
arrogant bastards
sisters :D
Oh it is ON
8,1first is another thing i'll go into at the tech meeting, but the other is more for here
braveheart!
10,02Everypony!
of course Fluttershy would help with the trees
I agree
surprised they didn't make a pinkie sense reference
No I dont.
go power ponies
farming is not cheap, nor is it easy, a crop can easily go bad then you're low on money
Go fluttershy
is it wrong to masturbate to pony porn
Aww
yes
dat RD innuenedo...
Ultimate Organizer In the house. Field. Orchard.
Equestria does not have a subsidy program.
epic
among many many other things
sometimes
all that shaking
i dont though
Any web hosts in mind?
yes!
maybe it is maybe it isn't
i do
"Lovely. Horrid! Horrid! Lovely."
Someone's gonna make this in part of rhythm ponies series.
Brace yourselves... Moar bigmacxRD shipping.
Nah
She would be too "Chicken"
BADUMYSH
8,1but one of the biggest thigns is that i think we should have way more control over our site than we curretnly do
inb4 they make a Rythm Heaven parody with "lovely! Horrid!"
the power has been DOUBLED!
And inventory.
And here's where the Bros screw up.
She would be like a penguin
Unicorn lazers are now canon
I expected the machine to explode.
Stop stealing fluttershy!
8,1especially considering that we stream copyrighted material
and here is where things go wrong
surprised applejack wasnt pissed they were ripping her trees out
The Moral: Don't Half-Ass it.
ikr
chickens can't run very fast
thats about disqusting
Pwned
lol
mac
Exactly
they haxed
poor Mac!
they didnt agree to have their trees destroyed
get off the dmn screen
I expected the machine to fail...
HAX
Jetsons referece!
YOU GO GrannY!
8,1we could use their free teir for setting up our own vritual server
This is more for the tech meeting though.
RUN
07,01yea.
jetsons reference?
8,1yeah, i won't go into the guts of it here
not uproot the trees which would severely damage their livelihood
8,1but this is part of a wider point
CHAOTIC
lolololol
11,01It does.
http://sinshi666.deviantart.com/#/d4nwvyr
they...
Hi Everypony!
is she getting humped?
oooohh, i see
lost :(
8,1i'm talking $2 - $5 a month
yeah
you can practically hear him shouting "AJ! Stop this crazy thing!"
too bad their Cider is crap
theirs tastes like SHIT
y stack them like that y not in a 4 sided pyramid? harder to count i guess
I now expected the town to turn on them!!!
I was then disappointed...
i'd rather drink shit
they do have style but somebody needs to shank these jerks
/me hugs Luna "Hello Dear!"
8,1it may even be under $1 a month
07,01ohai
dat laugh
were those hemp leaves in the background of their banner?!
why would she have signed up for that
lol
D:
mandark*
11,01Who pays? Us? Donations?
it was appleblooms fault
8,1but still, i wanted to raise the issue of raising money for the site's operations
/me hugs everypony
1,3type of apple I think?
ok
just noticed how their cutiemarks fit together
:)
8,1i have a couple of ideas
but still
Evidently Yiddish exists in Equestria
:'(
i kind of wished everypony had literally driven them out of town without even having to taste the cider
:'(
there was a BTTF refference?
meh: I said that already
If you want t call it cider...
kay
Luna!
eww
8,11) donations. we could put up a donate button and let our users donate money if they wish. very easy to set up
IT TASTES LIKE DIRT!
8,1bugger
bon bon XD
Tastes like sh*t
suddenly bits are dollars
Even Milhouse pony hated it.
8,12 secs
11,01Bon Bon's a VA.
8,1arhg
and they have CENTS
Lawl
8,1 1) donations. we could put up a donate button and let our users donate money if they wish. very easy to set up
11,01She's a pony of a million voices.
suddenly, bits
I CAN SEE INTO THE FUTURE
NO!
only rd would eat it then if its dirt :P
1 bit for the good barrels?
Lol "I cant get this taste off my tounge"
Next town, Apploooza :P
07,01that's a problem
aaww i was gonna say that
awesome
07,01due to the content
get out of here!
w0w the only think that came up was computers!
I've come to talk to you again
lol
Since we'd be legit then
Someone help me find a "Deal or no Deal" Clip
If Unicorns can use their magic to make machine-powering lasers, could they use their magic for weaponized lasers?
07,01^
07,01that's an option
8,1 2) t-shirts and other merch. this is a popular idea, and i know our users would buy BS merch
cent is an american term for 1% a dollar
:D
yup
just when he say's "Deal or no deal"
inb4 pinkie BUYS ALL THE CIDER
TL;DR :D
10,02Applejack: "I DIDN'T LEARN ANYTHING" LOL U MAD?
RaegFace
sooo
i hate u applejack
:D
Woooooooot!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Lol
Best. Lesson. EVAR.

Dammit Applejack.

11,01Ooh.
Best. Letter. EVAR.
lol T_T
BEST NIGHT EVEA

best letter
The Flim Flam Brothers did win
but they had more barrles
It was sooo awesome
movie day, actually :)
I wanted to se the letter be written and sent!! Hahaha!! xD
154 minutes to process wha-huh?
say say
G3 ponies D:
8,1but with the profits going to BS
#Vinyl_Scratch
NO G3!
11,01It was.
processing == uploading
BURN!
But they screwed themselves because it was undrinkable
TY kirzstrfe
wow
i like them a bit
heh
and technically, they lost, they didnt make cider, that cant count as cider
no not into the pit IT BURNS
Hmm apparently the Flim Flam brothers song is based on "Ya Got Trouble" from The Music Man.
GTFO
xD
"totally unrainbow"
assuming I remember, sure
I cant stay for the post show this time, Ill see yall next week
/me rolleyes
8,1i guess my point here is that money shouldn't be an issue for moving to EC"
8,1*EC2
10,02Please don't post anything in #Vinyl_Scratch until I say the word. Remember to follow the rules with requests and nothing longer tahn 10 min.
awesome
another ep..?
Well
oh, i didnt see that part
this is exciting.
u dare bring light into my lair?!
:'( u hurt my feelings
U MUST DAI!
10,02Go!
1,3SB is setting up for requests
daniel ingram is win
6_9
:(
04Well, merchandise shouldn't be a problem yeah
That, and they cannot unto quality control.
haha
04Commissions, clothing, music, etc.
8,1personally, i like 2 the best
yeah, happens to me too
10,02^
pinkie is staring at me
kk thx
lol
Because ad revenue would probably be pretty meh.
twilight is best trumpet player
?
:P
I guess it depends on how intrusive the look.
that it?
lol
well, I dunno
8,1well, we do get at least 5000 imperessions a week
1,3bed reception of it during last night's showing
04^On top of that, I'd like to draw the least amount of attention to us with corporations and IPs
that awkward moment when it isn't awkward
that's all they got?
07,01^
11,01Yeah.
ok
8,1aye
11,01Last thing we need is a cease and decist.
nah, that would be cheating
But the machine can probably detect ripeness, as well as rot.
apparently
04Exactly
The apple family isn't cheaters
Because pony eps would still be on the old domain.
an*
11,01Or worse.
he's loading up the next one/movie
movie?
04Don't say worse
well, because most people had already seen it before and as such they could see the jokes coming
yeah
Mobie?
oh
they show movies on here.
/me panics
*Movie
They made the mistake of shutting down the Quality Control mechanism...
like real cinema movies?!
(I didn't and as such found it hillarious)
8,1okay, well, it's something to think about
07,01okay anything else?
Mhmm
8,1 2 secs
07,01ok
thats some cool shit
like Epic Movie last night
yeah
8,1oh, yes, roles of techies
8,1but i think we already covered that
NO EPIC MOVIE
xD
no pls
the postshow.
lol i could watch that XD
8,1only ops are allowed to stream, yes?
1,3it's really a 1-time movie, seeing it more doesn't do anything for the movie
oh
aka people requests
lawl
they would have won if the others wouldn't have helped
there we go
And I missed it D:???
YES
Ops and designated streamers
yep
twice.
Mhm
8,1aye
.
aw
cool
8,1i.e. the 000 account
hmm
...Mastodon. I think.
not that I know of
boooo
Evil is arrogant
XD
/me was headbobbing
Or I'll get distracted reading FO:E-PH (if it updates tonight... which it seems to semi-consistantly)
hmm, are you sure? it has the option to send a message
lol
*headbangs*
8,1anyhoos
8,1moving on
dis music
RAWRity's request got thrown in the pooper
8,1n
8,1
8,1
I was actually ashamed to see that the Apple Family didnt welcome technology :\
8,1
ummmm
1,3<3
8,1whoops
well not really
8,1connection derp
1,3:p
True^
by pony
Well, the flim-flam brothers offered an unfair deal
see ya unnamed pon
yy
unfair is not even an appropriate description
I are back everypony
They probably would have gone for a fair deal. That deal was far from fair.
25% for the apple family?
8,1i don't like the wording "generally bad"
yeah
75% of the profits is hardly acceptable.
the fact that this clip is in it makes it 20% cooler
it should have been 50 50
8,1it makes people think we want to watch terrible movies, like Epic Movie
they were offered to just buy the machine first were they not?
same :P
And the vast majority of the work.
We do
60% would have been fair imo, the machine requires no work from them
:D
8,1when there are tons and tons of great low budget movies and cult classics out there
it's ponies, it doesn't need to be 20% cooler xD
/me bangs his head
60% for the apple family i mean
13well, it takes a certain level of bad, like plan 9
Is the stream muted? (or is it jsut me?)
welcome to the world of business
daww
omg its picking up!
1,3hehe
He must-- he's respected.
Battlefield Leverage bad is beautiful
8,1but "so bad it's horrible" is bleh
/me won once >.>
Thanks.
exactly.
>so bad it's good is subjective
8,1i think we should change the wording there
11,01We should post that XKCD comic on the rules page.
wat did you pick wen you won?
If they sold it, they'd have to build more.
how did she not see that coming?
I still come back even though my karma is the bitchiest on the goshdarn planet.
1,3Glomp pile!
8,1well, yes, but i think we should just be a bit clearer that we don't want to torture ourselves
idk O_O
she didn't need to
D:
Well it wasn't torture for me
=D
she is PHSYCIC
still have to finish foe
/me 11,01is pulled
:d
:)
honorary family members are still family members
:(
That's why I'm saying it's subjective.
8,1oh, also, i don't think we have anything about WMC in the rules
13well.. epic movie is also the first one since... sepember, babes in toyland
part way through foe-ph but i'm going to wait for it to finish
lol that wouldve been epic
8,1and we should put it in
/me glomps glompile
13to get wmc
I guess they'll go to one of the Apple Family's other farms and buy those out.
well, i gotta go, Goodnight everyone!:)
/me is pulled in
/me is smothered in glomps from glomp pile
>:O
:O
I vaguely remember ité
8,1anyhoos, that's more or less all i wanted to say
>:D
Well, Goodnight everyone! See ya later~ :)

Ooh... Tomorrow is 40K Day :D
this beter be ponies
40k day?
/me desperately scrambles away but is slowly dragged towards the glomptum singularity
whats that?
if it isnt
thats hardly fair at all
Just... keep staying off my lawn when I don't invite you on it, alright?
oh okay.
flutterremix
YES
/me waves his walking stick.
/me still at bottom of glomp pile
8,1and... Manos: Hans of Fate

-_-
this is pretty good
OMG it's fluttershy remix
/me passes out
i could D'aww to this.
07,01Zzzz
8,1aye, all i'm saying is we change the wording slightly
XD
/me throws a frisbee on Dermathil's lawn
no
sorry Luna
must
*insta-sleep*
if she was actually singing it
resist
sleep!
/me glomps Fleur

I'm next to you ;)
/me grabs it and throws it back.
/me naps
/me can't escape glompile despite years of moshpit training
See? No need to walk on my lawn.
11,01Buying all of those ships and troops for WH40K is expensive.
8,1yeah, i'm not contesting that it's subjective
that must be a huge army
07,01try /me txt

hoofprints are bad for its proper growth.
whats everybodys fav pony?
man...i wish there were show accurate toys...

All ponies are best pony

But the intention is different to different people.
oh, you were talking about the coffee
i know i loved that one
lol
fail
my cousins play it
i figured id do it for you, since you seem to be in need of a good facehoo
shes awesome
hoof*
:O:D
8,1my specific objection is the wording "generally considered bad"
derpy -.-
second is pinkie :D
muahahahaha
For me it's also just HORRIBLE films too.
04*description
:3
how DARE YOU:[
bufff I LICFF hotff coffeeee

04Such as budget cost
they're coming back

and they're gonna be awesome again.
I play an IG army... they get you with TANKS.
aww yeah I get mine free!!!
yeah forgot
Call upon the McPonies when you're in distress
13amendment to clarifying the A/B distinction (as i understand it, AGAIN), should probably make the six month encore and four week ineligible vote rules clearer/more visible
I used to play Warhammer 40k, but then I took an imperial army to the Tyranids
her official name is derpy now that she's canon
good
i wouldn't mind the derpy-sode myself
i checked the one that had some last night, seems theyve been sold or removed
i vote derpy-sode
Everypony, I need halp.
as do i
yeah. the rules forbid discussion of it
I need to find a sound clip for "Deal or no Deal"
oh
just like... *shivers* spiderseses.
of those fanfics?
>.>
where he just ask's the simple "Deal or no deal"
:( k
8,1aye
oh
they watch for spam
the spam vultures
Yeah, but taht isn't the streamer
Are we allowed to post videos that are not on CorporateTube?
04We could probably put it on our site somewhere
04Or in our rules
hmm, I don't know then
try soundcloud
Ummm idk?
.
mod, plz contact the streamer
poor thing you.
sorry Kira
this is an epic song
Are we?
I just need a 3 second clip @_@
This music.
13i think the four week thing is in the rules, but it's buried in that paragraph
I have a calender, lol
11,01I assume that the 4-week exclusion category would be for one slot of the lottery.
13but i'll bring that up more in the techie meeting when i talk content specifics for BS2.0
04If it is, we should make it its own paragraph
I must know this music.
it's a fluttersy remix
0,14QUick suggestion, sorry to interrupt, but maybe techies could put up something in the backlog to indicate whether or not somehting is eligble to be re-picked when BS2.0 launcheds?
*fluttershy
yeah
04They do
13SaxyPretender: http://du.cx/shizuka/?page_id=96 done
i got used to it and forgot it exists
8,1SaxyPretender: shizu's already done that
ive read them
Some guys have supermodels on their wall, I have ponies.
04They have that for the list
wait no
I like it.

Thank you, broski.

But that's just my opinion

Pegusus sideways tornado

coolest thing ever
lol
04They screw us over in our email
is it playing dif vid yet?
04They lump us in with every other pony stream
no
dat angle
10,02By grouping us with other streams and classifying outselves as a 'Marathon'
xD
shit
04Yep
we ASKED them how we could get on that site
i like that effect
and he basically said we were a one-trick pony
OBJECTION
8,1can i just ask, why are we trying to get away from EqD?
i'm not upset to begin with -.-
8,1wouldn't it be beneficial to work with them?
dont hate!

Because we don't want to be reliant on them.
10,02We like Rainbow Dash, they like Trixie, we just can't coexist.
dat correction
It could be a lot worse (most of today's music, specifically rap and hip-hop, for example)
it is frightening.
Because they let us down
this is epic with http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yo__1A-XR0c&feature=related
consistantly.
This is some AWESOME editING. Makes me even more proud of this fandom.
Twilight and spiderbabies.
