no
Slowtakon as usual
CriticKitten: I do feel he WAS trying. It was awful and he's completely inept at it, but he WAS trying. It's like watching a mentally challenged, paralyzed kitten try to walk up stairs.
dat superfilly
Trying to be a serious stallion than he's allowed to be
you missed voting otakon
SLOWKING! otakon
can't be asked to vote, just going to bop to this smexy voting music instead
fell asleep before poni episode, just woke up now...
hey, while I doubt Young would do good for a real name, Randomnerd's got somethign going. If he's an outsider in Equestria, he might go by a nickname
BULLSHIT!
/me 11,01sits on otakon
/me throws a pokÃ©ball at slowtakon
that was only 4 messages!
I'll save you otakon!
Slow otakon? ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh taaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyy kkaaaaaaaaaahm
If you care, you don't botch major scenes. If you care, you provide true development and don't slap exposition over your scenes. If you care, YOU PRONOUNCE THE LEAD CHARACTER'S NAME PROPERLY.
ONE QUESTION: whats the name of that smooth song??
welcome back TopHat :)
B movie that isnt horible but isnt exceptionaly good either: "That Darned Cat"
/me pushes nittany off otakon
Well, it's a conversion Bureau fic so...
11,01Ow.
CriticKitten: you talking about TLA movie?
Yeah, I keep thinking of Spaghetti Western Names, lol
X32 Ftw /) if you agree
11,01Don't make me spank yo.
oooh!
Do you have waterworld?
otakon: Yep
11,01*you
Nittany_Discord: trying for Derpy's job.
It's "Shame" by Evelyn, Yellowquiet
spank me?
ah
._.
Spank him!
the B-Movie is supposed to be passable filler to take up space until your A-Movie in a double feature
THY ^^
The Good, the Bad, and the Derpy.
HMU Boiz!!!! : D
listen i'm not into S&M
/me sits on the chat
XD
OBJECTION!
Randomnerd: Bud Spencer > Chuck Norris any day
if your B-Movie is actually god, well that's bully for you because you got a good movie on the cheap
carry on.
dat objection
Put it simply. M Night Shywhatever was doing what Ed Wood did for years on sheer instinct. Just with a bigger budget.
wtf is up with that pony
And then a hole broke in chat.
Agreed.
oh shi
/me hugs LordDerpington
Waits for Ponies to come on.
okay...
Do either waterworld or twilight.
Looks like Sonic Rainboom =D
Buck Norris
Kencolt: true, but TLA was not that good
Ed Wood also managed to back into some funny movies
Don't thank me, Yellowquiet, thank SoundHound. I was curious too.
Are there any weapons in this world?
Waterworld was good.
/me plays Sax along to this song
CriticKitten: it's been established for years taht M. Night lives in a different universe. he honestly thought Lady in the Water and The Happening were brilliant, cerebral movies. The man is an idiot, but he does honestly think he's doing a good job.
/me pushes nittany back further
back
/me dances and claps
and what kind if yes?
phase4
well funny in the fact that they were still bad but were entertaining
;D
how long was i gon for
But I still voted for Ponies.
=P
we watch the aristocats
/me 11,01explodes
damn
it
Shamalamadingdong doesn't evne get credit for that most of the time
He's going to smuggle a revolver into Equestria
10,02So, getting the chance to stream has always been of concern at times for those with the ability to stream. After experiencing a number of incidents with this over time, I wanted to help rectify the situation with maybe some rules regarding streaming.
Mostly pointing out that Epic Movie probably didn't deserve WMC even though it was trite and thoroughly crap. Dari is right, it was actively trying to be "so bad it's good" and just failed. That's not as bad, to me, as trying to be good and failing THAT badly. >_>
I missed VOTING!
boomer!
Gonna go do dishes and stuff, be back later.
goddamitvotingbot otakon?
8,1guys, can i just say: a B movie isn't mean to be bad. if it's so bad it's good, that's cool, but if it's so bad it's horrible, don't vote for it!
And a cowboy hat
good thing i pushed him back >.>
Six Shooter?
8,1there are tons of great B movies out there
indeed
1,3by chat timer, 13min
8,1low budget classics
8,1and cult movies
Crossair?
planet terror is good B-movie
B is for ^
10,02(going to multitask here a bit with streaming BMN and typing out my thoughts, bear with me)
dat timer
you know how JB's music slowed down x6000 sounds really relaxing? we should watch epic movie slowed down by x6000
Lady in the Water was good exposiion until I realized that that was the movie.
Finally some people who know what B means.
/me sweeps Nittany_Discord into a pile.
kool intermission is bout over den
B is for batman and robin
Trigger.
i beg for that to be picked.
[wub]ehren: WE'D DIE.
shaun of the dead is a great B movie :3
The Terminator (I) was technically a B-Movie
Wait, that's the name of the lone ranger's horse...
had to showa :D
it usually wasn't the feature
B is Big Mac
/me 11,01dusts off Meanwhile
I still want the original Japanese Godzilla. One of my favorite DVDs.
but it did absolutely killer
YES! Planet Terror is a EXCELLENT example of a great B movie
shaun of the dead is a/b
and it made a lot of carrers
No, it's Silver that's his horse
/me sneezes.
seeing as it's a good parody movie
Dashie: that's a great choice, way better than what most think B is.
only cinephile know about B movies though
And I like that
Chucky is A right?
hey Tovler
yeah
00,10inb4 we start baning users along with the movie they picked
Little Shop of Horrors (remake) Is a good B movie
Yeah, making Epic Movie last 5 days sounds like a brilliant idea
13the point of WMC though is that when even the chat can't have fun with it, it's time for it to die </late>
Trigger it is
Troll Hunter for B MOVIE!
XD
Plan 9 was probably the funnest B movie I've had on Bronystate.
Troll Hunter!
yes!
You'd think with Thatguywiththeglasses, people would pick better B movies.
I own it
it's good
8,1technically, El Mariachi (one of the greatest films of all time) is considered a B movie
Hey, Dermathil
Oh, Trigger was Roy Rogers's Horse
have you all shown Killer Klowns yet
I'd like to see waterworld
8,1it was shot on a budget of $7000
You got it :)
hiya Dermathil
Killer Klowns from Outer Space is so hilariously trite
it's great
Hey Dermathil ~
eeyup
Tovler: we should just go through all of The Cinema Snob's back log.
Machete is lol
/me has a potential project that he's currently brainings over.
Id put my vote in for killer clowns or waterworld
Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes!
RAWRity: eeyup
Machete you be a great B movie
Pinocchio and the Empire of the Night for B movie.
*would
if only movies realized they could spend so little and be so great.
i liked the losers movie
Nice music.
Music is nice~
suddenly music
Bow chicka-wow wow
Bee movie was a good B movie
oh, that song
dodgeball anyone?
well, Derpinton, Plan Nine is an EPIC B-movie. As opposed to the movie that wasn't shown and never existed and didn't stream.
of SAXYNESS!
ME GUSTA
8,1actually, i vote El Mariachi
I'd vote for killer clowns or Shaun of the dead. Oh and epic win of debating music
Goes with the whole shirt but no pants thing you have going on there SB.
the original Wicker Man is a B movie, and it's considered by many horror fans to be one of the greatest films in the Genre.
Inb4 Saxy!
RAWRity pfft.. it would only take 200 days
"if you can dodge a wrench you can dodge a ball"
SaxyPretender: Get Over Here!!!!
Combustiblelemons, great choice

Lyra was doing her mugging-at-the-camera-hopping again on today's episode.
I clopped to that R63 pic once. Just sayin.
08,14Ja
In case of 4th wall breach, unplug all electronics, hide in the closet and panic
1,3no movie, more ponies

O_O....was there any references to other westerns, like A Fistful of Dollars...Has there been a Clint Eastwood pony? There should be!
Make Derpy work? Are you nuts?
I dunno
Irony would be them getting into a car, and punching out the floor so they could gallop.
Perhaps none.
That's what they're trying to say, just explaining the picture
yo dawg so i heard you like ponys.. so i let ponies chase ponies so you can watch while u watch!
They mighta skipped the movie.
dawwwwwwww
Wow..
so cute
Someone said it exploded twice
Awwwwww
10,02The first idea, with new departments being setup, communication is going to be key in order to ensure individual projects and such are done in a timely manner. Therefore, I propose to each department that a weekly report is done summarizing what has been done, updated/new time frames for individual projects, etc. Basically, anything noteworthy about projects involved in those departments
10,2would be recorded to inform other groups and team members. This helps to also keep everything organized and see what needs to be improved on. If you all like the idea, the details can still be discussed.
derpy made a hole
;_;
Hey Placebo.
no one asks where rarity pinkie are...
Howdy Cavy!
<More my mode.
If Derpy were to work Nittany_Discord the damage done would be unrepairable. >_>
Skipped the movie?
Got my name back.
=D
That's the joke
no one cares
nice. xD
>Element of Loyalty
I believe so.
Explains why Ponies are still on..
>Leaves friends in desert
Yep.
[22:06:58] <kirzstryfe> the movie file exploded twice
Derpy working... well, if you want to clear out all of POnyville for a total rebuild, well...
indeed
New one later.
hell,
Also, Dogpile.
I feel kinda sorry for Rarity. Kinda is the key work here.
what?
sappy=tree rainbow dash=tree=fluttershy jk
>element of loyalty
let the vultures take care of them
oh right
Oh
Only new if you haven't seen it. xP
We can laugh at people who haven't seen it.
chimmicherry or cherrychonga?
hmmm
and then rainbow went to hospital
>Abandons friend's business for cider
they were going to be ok
Will be GLORIOUS
Chimmicherry > cherrychanga.
hehehe
That reminds me
and rainbow is gonna be in the hospital next week
It is up in 1080p on youtube, if anyone's interested.
So, are we going to watch random pony episodes or are we going to watch a movie?
Kill Dash Vol.1
My little pony!
0,14Sounds good to me.
Chimmicherrychanga
Suddenly, two episodes later RD is in the hospital.
Rareity never completely destroyed RD
0,5^Perhaps the weekly reports could done in spreadsheets?
strange.
movie
and yep
LOL
ikr
Can't imagine why.
!cd
Episode 16 of season 2 "Read It and Weep" airs in 6 days, 16 hours, 37 minutes, 27 seconds (Feb 04 2012 15:00:00 GMT)
lool
Nope.
I think Rarity was just about to say something Unlady like when she held her breath there
RawketLawnchair: pony eps because Epic Movie was WMCed
But she does go to the Hospital.
dat music
That was a good episode.
It's a mystery
Next week.
what is wmc?
so close to the new episode...
do I hear Eye of the Tiger?
do the pinkie pie babysitting episode!!
i dont care what we watch
*ololol face*
i am here for epic movie
04I'm assuming these reports will come from each department?
derpy_pony: Worst Movie Clause
then both got drunk and woke up married
derpy_pony: it means the movie was so bad nopony wanted to watch it again
Happy B-day spike!
11,01Hi.
youtube ftw
i only care if its good
04Ah, right
legal loopholes -.-
derpy_pony: your gonna be disappointed
secret of exess
I hope not, Derpy_pony
04All that blue got to me for a moment
What is this one again?
epic movie was that bad
oh god
00,10now you know otakon SB dosent have the eps local
Spikes Bday?
dat Sorcerers Apprentice
I expected to be disappointed...but not this way
fine
Which is this now?
Sumica: but YOUTUBE!
10,02The second idea relates to warnings/bans.
she really likes books
Worst Movie Clause. In other words, a move so terribad that almost every viewer agrees that it cannot, indeed must not, EVER be eligible for a vote again.
04I'm also assuming the reports would go straight to admins?
wait what?
i'll make my own interwebs if ACTA passes
wati
Modern Spellcasting is now a classic
Oh....Oh...of course reshelving day.....
I'm reminded of that music number from Sword in the Stone.
This was a good episode, but probably one of my least favourite :I
Fire stone?
Ah. Got it.
modern spellcasting is classic? how is modern classic?
Spike man.
A heart container?
Rarity threatens RD, RD eventually ends up in hospital..
Would that be an accurate descriptionj?
o this one
MODERN Spellcastin is a CLASSIC?
then let's watch back to the future 2....everybody likes back to the future
y u no breathe fire spike
Spike's gonna evolve!
Spike MAD.
Conicidence? I think not.
spike the conisure
his giggle is so cute in this episode
olol
otakon: IKR
thought it was lesson zero
fire heart contaner stone?
you can AGE a ruby?L
fire stone
Kencolt: eeyup
That's the thing when you name anything "Modern" - it's still got that title a hundred years later.
Well the Modern Era of literature runs from 1920 to 1947 roughly
yea Y U NO
lol
Zolga was an imposter, also have a nice day everyone :3
otakon: Rock Farm.
I'm going to be on next week at 10.
everything else is PostModern
a dragon can
10,02They could, but I was also thinking they could be public on the forums in their individual topics.
spike's birthday is the same day twilight becomes celestia's apprentice
That's the best way! ^_^
EspyLacopa: yh
So I can see how that plays out.
=P
07,01public ?!
so it could have been "Modern" Spellcasting in that sense
i have a stone like that
Curious to how she gets there 0.0
yeah
but magic
10,02Well, for team members I mean
07,01ahhh
my mom makes jewlery
snort snoer
Eeyup. I'm devoting myself to waking up before 9 (on a saturday) for ponies.
fail
Same.
:(
Rareity probably lamps her with a potato
Fire Stone
13o/ would be better if all mods can see it, no reason to keep us in the dark about what everyone is doing
i hate rarity!!
Spike's gonna evolve...
1,3us-public, not public-public
LOL!
00,10Fire ruby riped off from g1
>mfw opening a door using hte inner doorknob while outside
Nice, kira.
:O
07,01^
I'm going to guess she falls or messes up a trick.
How tragic for you.
fluttershyfan158: then GTFO
Something to that affect.
atleast 20
8,1wait a minute
...
why would you hate rarity :(
today we hate flim and flam
Maybe she's just sick.
Sad for YOU!!!
That must evolve an Eevee so quickly!
Rarity might have a little Rouge the Gem Stealing Bat in her
Never know =P
Idk, man. She's ran into things at like, mach 6 face first
20%
07,01okay I would like that... BUT I see a issue... what if nopony keeps their reports updated?
Love and tolerance
8,1it's spike's birthday, which means it's also the day they all got their cutie marks
gems are extremely common in equestria
what does a gemstone taste like to a dragon? are they like sweets are to us
yes it is
ew. Flareon can't even learn Flare Blitz
:F
Swagg
yea
no Spike dont!!
So what is next weeks episode about?
Well, Rarity can find gems. Rouge has to steal them.
it can if you use rage glitch
0,5What if someone was assigned with doing reports?
smileyfaise
11,01And Rarity cons Spike out of his present.
i would stick my horn in rarity
Here comes Spike's Y U NO face.
nooooo
what a gold digger
I didn't think about that
just saiyan
xD
Rarity gains another Health Point
0,5In each depy.
Well, when she does the Sonic Rainboom, she breaks the sound barrier, Instantly jumps to Mach 10 at 7000 MPH and Shatters the visible light spectrum.
;)
0,5*dept
get in there son!
a Gemstone from the way that Spike was talking about it is probably like cheese
Hahaha
i don't hate her..(rephrase) i just find her annoying..
So, in our worl.
and then he gets kissed
World*
0,14dat Symbolic Gesture ;u;
13lesson zero style: report when there is something to report
And then he died.
since he was talkign about aging it over a period of months
ninjad me archer
You'd be dead.
Eeyup
doo dee doo dooooo
Thanks, Placebo
And THEN she colides.
next week, rd collides with education...hillarity will ensue
So.
Starscream vs Rainbowdash, much?
>element of generosity
That was epic.
and Cheese is usually aged in terms of months
=D
Unless you were pnkie
Nittany_Discord: or, she inadvertantly inspires an act of generosity and is genuinely thankful for the gift.
xD
OK. As far as Spike is concerned, it's a fair trade.
spike the stalker...
for real
0,5Our weekly letters to the admins. "Dear prince dari..."
a dragon and a pony...oh god why!!!
never was again!
At least Rarity doesnt use it for a dress design...Generousity!
>Rainbow Dash
congratulations spike, you are the new element of generosity
>seduces spike into giving his prized posessions away
Combustiblelemons: WooHoo!!
darn I missed the new episode
>Shatters Visible light spectrum.
And Twilight proves to be best Mom
eww
DeadpoolDash: It's on YT by now
:D You mad Physics?
07,01okay
Yuck.
Dragon+Pony= ????

How I met your mother on netflix, Ponies on here... I can't handle this much awesome
Actually, we haven't shown it yet. They haven't. Not we. They.
thinking with portals
10,02Yeah, the second idea I had.
twilight used magic..
Lmao!
lolwut
wut
04If you're suggesting having weekly reports by the departments, then I think it's only fair that the admins go over them accordingly
Instant Transmission
Cavy: Rainbow Dash could only to that because she never learned Physics.
lol
Yellowquiet Drony
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGSX03xzJc4 << The BGM that plays in my head when Spike starts to go full Greeed mode
Pinkie is best pony.
Pinkie Broke the 4th wall

Goku ain't got nothin' on pinkie.
I'm awesome haha
yes yes she is
HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR.... GREEED
No video link BlueDWarrior
lol RD bought him weights
Not at all
04I wouldn't mind having the other departments taking a look for communication, but all of the decisions should ultimately come down to the admins
Happy Birthday to.... YOU~
Like my dogs when theyre about to get a bath, my cats like water more then the dogs -_-
Fillyfillyy or a pragon
Cavy: No you're not, dude, don't lie.
I like to think RD just grabbed something from under her bed and slapped a bow on it.
yay
Dumb book
lol
That too RAWRity. None the less, she's still EPIC.
lol
Cypresswolf: put dog treats in the bath tup.
Forever a book.

If he'd only read thnem...
04In the case of projects or what have you
Spikey Wikey.
10,02Any decisions will come down to those departments
I never thought of that. Thanks RAWRity
/me needs a more powerfull computer
I think he likes the box more
Stiffest blanket. ever.
04But they need to be run by admins first for clearance
Hugs.

kirzstryfe: the episodes aren't streamed in chronoligical order
Pimp Spike!!!!
lolol %kirzstryfe
why isn't spike in school?
10,02Can be anything in the report really, but nothing like 'SuperBrony came in and said Hi', has to be of relating to the department and shows what progress has been made that week.
Swagg
Bitchin.

In what grocery store do you find a hat like that? O_o

episode 2
Spike's got Attention Deficit Disorder...
The gangly look really works though.
He went to talk to Who, the Doctor that is.
I'm going to need years of therapy
broken voice
10,02While the forums have been an effective way of notifying of bans, it becomes difficult to understand who have broken rules previously and how recent. Therefore, I was thinking we could incorporate a spreadsheet on Google Docs detailing about various users who have been kicked/warned. That way, if someone is seriously trolling the chat and are borderline, we can refer to that doc to see
10,2if they have been trouble in the past and respond accordingly.
your balls dropped
lol
^^^lololol
Dragonballs.
He's becoming Dan Green
dr muffin
Dr. Muffing Top!
07,01sure, that can be done easily
is that a human on the chart?
Z^^^
RAWRity: Can't unsee!
10,02By breaking the rules in the beginning, I mean those who have been just kicked/warned instead of banned.
lol
derp
OH MY GOD
MEDIC!
ooo he did
07,01that way we don't have tons of responses in the ban topic and just 1 link to the document.
HES A DRAGON
you don't say!!
you don't say.jpeg
:O
00,10spy check
OMG!
u dont say
well never
No, really?
No, REALLY!?
foreshadowing!
11,01I'm surprised his face didn't teleport to Princess Celestia.
10,02That too, bans can be reported there as well if needed.
baby ponies!
LOL
10,02But in order for it to work, it needs to be constantly updated like the ban list on the forums.
Know about baby ponies? .....err....ok
Doctor Flummoxed
07,01okay, makes sense
Just as a note
07,01we can just link the file

04Interesting
He must have missed that stage
:o
ba dum tus
07,01nice

Stop right there criminal scum!
10,02Perfect, that can be used in updating the document. Just simply copy and paste that list over the old one.

Good idea putting him in a room
For the Horde!
Bad Idea, Putting him a room full of stuff
Spike stole my Forever Lazy
RaveBrony: he's not a flying dragon, obviously
He might not be the kind of dragon that gets wings
Spike made a back door
I got kicked from that chatroom
For the Allianz
How many rooms are in that tree?

Spike stole my BMW!

At least Spike didnt steak the bark too

It's been suggested that a dragon overtaken by greed doesn't grow slowly enough to develop wings...

/me missed Vivi
Godzilla scene time!
Oh the places spike will go

KAIJU ALARM
Air raid!
so VioletVanilla why the Derpy costume?
air raid siren? was there a war?
Sorry for the spam everyone =/
13otakun!
One of the few times we see Pinkie totally lost.
spike has some epic spikes
There is a Kaijuu on the loose
congartulations..your spike evolved into godzilla!!
13why NOT the derpy costume?
10,02Could, but I would personally prefer Google Docs as it keeps record of who updates the document and when.
Someone call the Power Rangers!
They have an air raid siren? xD
Shizuka: good point
squished ponies :'( oh the horror
Derpy!
Why not is never a good answer.
king kong anyone
07,01yea...that's also an option.. although I like gdocs more

From the same chat?
wow, I just noticed
Means you don't even have to update a google doc manually.

There should be an award for that...

right, enough pretenting im Henrietta Lyncast, and while this has been fun, its time for me to go
Wonder how many people slammed their face against the screen for dat kiss.
dat Rarity kiss!
It's how Spike remembered it.
What a twist!!
eeyup~
seriously, that scene is why this is one of my favorite eps of the show.
dat music
Dragons might have weird vision
dat shrinkage
keep calm and grab fluttershy
Placebo: just you...

oooh rarity
So..
I facepalmed
you are not helping
to much blush!
Is Equestria the World or the Country?
That silver pegasus had a rainbow for a cutie mark O.o
10,02Alright
Rarity ain't heelping.
Good question, actually
Lauren Faust said she thought of it as a Country on her DA page.
RaveBrony: clearly he's RD's father.
Country
thousands of spectators, all looking at you ;)
rainbow dash lol
:o
Well it should be D:
Ahh, that explains that then
Oh snap, RAWRity, lol
Implying there are other Pony countries, which means Pony armies, which means Pony Wars?
Rainbow dash show.... I'd watch it.
everypony loves rainbow dash
My hair!
WILMA!!!
I wouldn't watch The Rainbow Dash show.
would you watch the rainbow dash show?
There's equestria, unicornia, that rainbow placce
Same Placebo, but you already knew that.
10,02This one might be self-explanatory, but the idea is making a weekly schedule for the stream outside of main events.
I would
:o
All the G3 places
Meanwhile: same
Maybe...
dat regality
meh it needs more than just rainbow
RD is worst mane 6.
Dat flowery language
Spike is best Shakespeare
without lauren faust there would be no rainbow dash
Well, you have to read into it pretty deep.. But "commander" definitely carries a military background to it
I would watch the Rainbow Dash Show
true
LE GASP
because Rainbow Dash allways dresses in style
celestia has only ruled for 1000 years
DU DUN DUNNN
Indeed.
Spike-- the Shakepearan actor-- oh, wait.
pegasisters
Very true
TAKEAGASP! really?
Spike said the H word OOOOO
and then Spike was Best Puck
And there are different races. Donkey's, zebras, and griffons are all canon so far.
They also confirmed that Tanks and Bullets exist in their world.
spike is more lke shatner
There was already a Rainbow Dash before Lauren Faust
So, Army is real.
epic music for the play
The new episode was neat
still better than biebers concerts -__-
Blame DC
So there's enough of a chance that I consider fanfics to be plausible.
Wait, tanks in Equestria?!?
Sincwew when?!
LOL
Kira_Pony_Yamato: Tank the turtle? =3
They named the Turtle Tank.
*facekeyboard*
fail
Scratch that.
LMAO!
Pegasi and unicorns are self righteous douchebags, who would have guessed.
9if I may?
Dashie named it tank.
/me twiddles his moustache.
...inside a house
10,02Yes, go ahead
Winter Storm? BETTER DRINK MY OWN PISS.
tank is beast

Haven't seen that episode.
Yep.
Better watch your capslock.
Called "May the Best Pet Win
Surely Unicorns could transmute food through equivalent exchange?
"
if u could be a pegasus,unicorn,or earth pony what would u rather be?
Unicorns. Control the Sun and moon, can't hold a door against the elements.
/me strokes his beard
meanwhile, ate the equestria UN
Oh, and that reminds me:
It's the only one I've missed thus far, and to be honest, I've been too busy/lazy to look it up

Hmph!
It, too, is canon.
i want to see derpy episode

No ideas. earth ponys
its canon
9There is a huge problem with the schedule system, and thus, I would like to impart personal experience of my own
ScootaChicken: Private Wang Fire is best Fire Nation Soldier
10,02There needs to be a MLP RTS game
derp
derp
YOU'RE NOT THE BOSS OF ME
I luv this episode

you mean the last roundup
I WILL NOT STAND FOR THIS INSULT
Skyrim.. only with ponys

*snow*
*plays malcom in the middle themesong*

SuperBrony64: I'd play that.
eeyup
You're not the boss of me now! And You're not so big! Life is unfair!
9you might or might not remember the Giant Robot Saturday Night event I tried holding back in old BronyState...it was a test for a system like this
Humans can learn ALOT from ponies...
can you put it on
the RTS must be have new lunar republic
Didn't turn out well
life is unfaaaaiiiiirrrr ^_^
go to youtube and watch it
it was an utter disaster
Derpy was canon until they actually called her Derpy.
Life is unfair. Boohoo.
i love that song
>Juss saying.
Real Time Strategy=RTS
That horse sound
Cry mich ein river.
poor fluttershy
you mean non canon?

13SuperBrony64: would a turn based be okay?
whos putting the videos on?
fluttershy in that armour = epic win
lol
fos ro dah!!!!
Perhaps I'm confusing myself.
9my end conclusion was that it was pretty much impossible to hold a schedule, even if it was set for hours I THOUGHT I would be available...
Wang Fire :3
1 sec
Eeyup.
Define Canon.
>.>
0,14>turned based RTS pony game
MLP: Friendship is MMORPG
9in the end there is always the possibility that whomever is in charge is not going to be able to make it
lol wut
Canon is proven true by the show.
>Fail attempt to see if I was using it right.
Ask pinkies, she has lots of parptay ones
This episode proves that humans can learn ALOT from ponies...

i make sprite comics anyone know where to find mlp sprites?
lol your pinging him wrong XD
I'd assume Fanon would mean it's considered true even though not confirmed?
9set certain times every once in a while in which a streamer is ABSOLUTELY SURE can make it...and if they can't, someone else can take over for them
Or you could.. you know... eat that hat..
We're out of food btw
lol!
1,3we already played the derpy episode today brieannar
/me needs that civ V mod

Desktop Ponies has lots of sprite-like graphics.
ja
We need to gather the top scientists of the world and develop an offline virtual equestria and an online one

They are in 1011
humans in equestria = jumping the shark imo
ts uneadedly complicated
Wait, now or in the future?
This is before Celestia
11,01Maid Meanwhile is best maid.
there was a human in the cakes' nursary
They have lights.. those were invented in what, 1830?
I'll abandon fandom if that happens
During Celestia, I'd say 1890
lol
Because there is a car kinda thing in the new one.
@_@ That's being a bit nitpicky, ain't it? Close is close
RD drawing a line with a tree, lol
I think I've seen lights before, but I can't remember off the top of my head
and another thing..i recently read something called my little dashie..
11,01http://www.justanimal.org/images/human-4.jpg <- Human
10,02Dat ping
True
Fair enough, Placebo.
Badum tsh
You have that set to ping you SB?
lol
=P
Whats a human...oh
A pet rock.
pinkie is best troll
SHE SOILED IT
OH god they are fighting over a rock
Ferrari will probably be a top auto maker in Equestria
A BLOODY ROCK
Dat SuperBrony64 :3 hihi you~
what is it with Rairty and rocks anyway
No!
I love Pinkie's voice when she goes "losers wheepers"
facehoof
lolwut?
MUSTANGS!
xD
Tom's grandfather
i've never cried so hard in my life!!! T_T
Mustang = Ford
Puddinghead: Say what you will, my side has the exit!
Dear god Nittany_Discord, so there is such a thing
arrowtobroknee: Are you a mind reader?
eeyup
11,01Yes.
Ferrari' logo is a horse, same as the Mustang
:P lol lol lmao
are you a wizard?
10,02So far, we had a schedule doc setup by Fluttershy...but it might be best to use another document for such purposes (if we decide on it). But the idea was to update the schedule and have an idea for what to stream and when throughout the week. We can make this doc available to everyone (even viewers, but only for viewing) and if anyone wishes to stream, they may make note of it at least
10,0224 hours inadvance. You can only take up a 3 hour block on the schedule. If the designated streamer isn't available after 15 min in the scheduled block of time, the stream is free up for anyone else to take over. We would also include a disclaimer that the stream is not guaranteed and can change without notice.
Ferrari Schmerrari
I prefer McLaren
10,02Hai :3
Scruncy face.
So, can Fluttershy fly and not get affected?
It's still a kid's show. Gotta make it easy to see.
sup?
but alas, you are right.
I might be, or just pinkie pie
who wants a pinkiesicle?
well... those three aren't full of HATE
RaveBrony: her wings would freeze
I prefer BMW, but that's just me
I'll be back in about 15 minutes
Windigos.
GIVE US MORE HATE
haters!
Honda :)
Ah, understood
dash has a wingboner
gotta shovel some snow around
I refuse to believe in the existence of "Humans"
NO!
starswirl
Cessna.

HAters gonna hate
they are the haters...
Honda Civic?
wasbn't that the guy twilight dreed up as
00,10twilight exposision
Never heard of them :o
10,02So yeah, any opinions on it?
11,01Hmm.
0,14I like it.
Honda = ecenomy car
we 3 kings of equestria...
du know.. nightmare night?
How could this happen.
I like Honda because they are Reliable and preservable
As cooold as iiiiice
DatEpicVoice yes yes it was
It's not good for anything else.
*dresed
don't hate!
:D
REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY
Really^12 dislike
Fluttershy hates RD. canon.
I prefer a bit of performance
Hatershy
fus ro dah!!
really really
i mean, cmon. Hind legs? Hairless bodies? FINGERS? impossible
Hate is such a strong word.
*gasp*
If it rusn, I like it
d'aww fluttershy
Reallyx12 Dislike her.
PWN TIEM
dat horn!
Fire of riendship
You counted? xP
Also my favourite car is the Dodge Charger
but I love Hate
oh
05,15People tend to not read notices like that, so if someone doesn't stream, and it's on the schedule, people might panic
umad spirits
I hate doctors and lawyers and cops...
Windigos: Hey what are you doing, you are supposed to hate each other...
Widigoes: Darnit! Now you've got us actin all sappy
but unicorns are best apparently
AVATAR STATE Lol
And stairs.
haters gona hate
god mode enabled!
KEEP HATING
YES
Fluttershy hates Rainbow Dash.
/me looks at his paws. "Not sure about the impossible part there."
I like the Doctor
Stickin' with Cessnas.
Heart piece
0,14An addendum I'd like to propose if perhaps having a back-up streamer (which could work on a rotating system) ready in case the schedule streamer couldn't make it
Why aren't you hating
Now Canon.
HAX!!!!!
=D
Freindship saves the world yet again
How could this happen?
Poor spike.
YAY friendship
/me has a black shirt that says JERK on it.
C wut i did thar?
unicorns are the aristocracy
HAHA
which BTW is magic
i like trains...
why is it that even in a story about the past, twilight is thebst mage ever?
thats 3 times
*facehoof*
*the best
xD
I don't like the new Charger as much as the calssic
But...
OH GOD
04As long as you're not trying to set up some kind of stream schedule
SPIKE YOU PASTA
Well Friendship is Magic... literally
04Because that shit just won't fly
/me is hit by train
/me 11,01dies of melted heart.
Didn't Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy sleep with eachother?
hahaha
And they died from melted hearts.
Indeed
....
fluttershy and rainbow dash just brohoofed
epic brohoof by dashie there
1,3sounds more like a notification than a set schedule
Herdmind Nittany_Discord.
so the fact that Friendship defeats Hate incarnate would stand to reason
O_e
Hey-- Clover was the apprentice of StarSwirl. Not going to be incompetent.
mein gott
Wahoo.
equestria!
there are no stallions so how was this land populated?
See what I did there?
EE QUES TREE UHH
there are no stallions so how was this land populated?
*SPOILER* *SPOILER* Well, she found her in bed naked...
I totally saw that pony_4680 :)
Meh, sounds overcomplicated.
What a story mark.
I Like Trains
all rise for the national anthem
theypredicted celestia and luna on their flag?
and that's how equestria was made!
Who wants a brohoof!?!?1 (\
It's a Creation Myth
Was THAT what that scene was about?
Ponies are almost always naked -_-
/me loves this song
ya know
so you'd use the current flag or whatever
07,01Merry x-mas
I spy the CMC.
10,02That's the topic right now though. To help give our viewers an idea of when we will stream.
xD
fluttershy can see the future
^
that is how
AGAIN
where did celestia and luna come from
That scene always lost me.
True enough
Merry x mas for a month ago.
i spy....
Doesn't make it any less true.
Everyones talking about morning wood and stuff.
So.
that is the only question left
Merry Malcolm X-mas to you too.
It's like the Founding of Rome
DatEpicVoice: nah, Private Pansy can though!
1,3I know a number of people have been asking about what/when stuff streams during the week
10,02Otherwise we might as well just move on if it's not going to happen.
Ponys that are having fun
/me cheers
Faust says that that's meant to be a mystery.
sounded as real as 300
Ravebrony Brohoof accepted /)
0,5That could attract more viewers...
00,10I realy cant commit to set times unless it's the dead of night
Those are pretty modern..
why cant i see what i typed?
i didnt remember the name of the char she palyed
lulz
:D
Combustiblelemons: you DON'T wanna know. Trust me. I asked them. Was not a story I wanted to hear.
I was talking about cars...
I never got that scene, it was just them looking down for a second, and then Fluttershy blushing.
Means they have a plastic industry
1,3maybe set up a feed or twitter to announce when streams start up?
Windigo: Rooooaarrr!
Which means the drill for petroleum.
So much for good friends.
oh ok. i'll take your word for it. :S
the haters are bac D:
rawr
*Back
Windigo's exist.
lol
haters are hating
10,02Hmm, that's not a bad idea ^
Plaestic
nananananna
Windigos are out there.
Wait.
Where are the drilling rigs?
Damnit you were supposed to keep hating
anyways I've gotta get up early tomorrow
That means Gas is coming next?
and then.. after they finally found peace
DISCORD
xD
night everyone ^_^
ah stupid Friendship
yfw that wasn't the Windigos, that was me after watching Mare-Do-Well
morning?
we never see any oceans
not sure if me or not everytime i see it
I'd say it means they already have it.
Which confirms cars.
CANON
Sleep tight Combustiblelemons

It's got serious Music Man vibes in that ep... so very 40's-50's musical.
woot woot
oh lord trixie
PARTY OF ONE :(
/me cant wait for read it and weep
the great and pwoerful trixie!!

TheGreatAndPowerfulT: your on tv!
Night everypony.
i hate trixie!!
epic moustache
i think
Spoiler! Trixie is a show off
07,01yep, she does
Good night Meanwhile
i watched this ep several times
gnight Meanwhile
DeadpoolDash: eeyup
10,02Well, the issue is if she's the only one on it and she's not around, then it can't be updated.
IT'S SPINES SPIKES EVIL BROTHER
trixie may be a showoff
This episode is an insult to space bears.
Dat moostache.
romeo 0_0
noooo!
but she is pÃ¼retty epic
daw
Twilight finds Spike attractive.
aw rats
Canon.
aa aha ah
/me 13jots down notes, that could be something we make an irc bot do, among other things
11,01We can't tie the Twitter to a feed?
Trixie needs to return, with legit magic this time
11,01Or use a common account?
italian intro is best intro
Trixie needs to get eaten by a bear
His moustache has experienced more than a lesser man's entire body..
Twilight finds Spike attractive.
Canon.
I do like the fanfics that promote Trixie as a legit Magi
An ursa major perhaps?
instead of a two-bit hustler
actually spike wanted the moustache to woo rarity, hence 'romeo'
04Maybe if others would like to use the twitter?
inb4 trixie and twilight rematch
that opening is soo METAL
yep.. trixie returns as a fully realized mage
/me wonders just how hard Wrek passed out lastnight
Pedolight sparkle?
10,02I wouldn't mind updating the Twitter.
But yeah, is late. must bed. you all have fun.
8,1i'm back
Do you guys think the Dodge Ram would sell well in Equestria?
Potato
lyra!
Now This Is A Knife!
math is a talent?
0,14I have a bit I'd like to say about that and things relating to that, but I can wait till general.
bai meanwhile
Trixie has capable, decent magic. SHe's just prone to exaggeration... and is unaware of who's got the REAL power.
see ya meanwhile
night Meanwhile
Mai talluntt eez Magikz
Idk. they seem to get around pretty well.
*Insert trixie*
Bai Meanwhile
Bye~ Meanwhile
trixie is dark twilight
Mai talluntt eez Magikz
11,01Watch in awe as I turn this channel 180 degrees!
A fanfic Idea of mine gives Trixie the ability to COPY Spells.
what does snails' cutie mark means?
cutting ability?
im watchimg
Dat blush.
Trixie is Mega Man?
snails sounds like derpy
Kencolt Trixie's tallent is /tricks/. get it? Trixie. The trick pony.
AWW YEAAAAAAAAAAAAA
lol somepony's alittle full of herslef
yawn
SHOWOFF!!!!
pppft
actually Twilight has the canon ability to sufficently analyze magic and reproduce it
someone told me it was spelt tricksy
How does Seth like this character again?
she is a show magician.. she is SUPPOSED to show off
unless it's something stupidly complicated
or it aint a show
Fireworks is now magic
07,01okay shall we move on?
good old speaking in the 3rd person
OK... that makes a sort of sense.
1,3Trixie has a lot of fanon
so does derpy
best excuse to run away
oh god...
I just played NUTS ON THE TABLE with my friend
if oyu go to the circus
with the difference she is completely unable to LEARN a spell, she simply copies the spell with weaker results. Think of Archer from Fate/Stay Night
"I.. I.. I.. Moustache!"
lol
and the magician goes all " yea.. this is nothing special"
07,01Embed switching (SB)
its just.. meh
Oh god
why are the reload stream and reload chat buttons next to each other? i made the damned things, what derp posesed me to do something so obviously error prone
I won the game though
terrible pun
Cars are canon now?
haters!
Rd... so many lessons to learn as yet...
lol
BlueDWarrior exactly. Twilight's tallent is magic. Trixie's tallent is magic tricks.
10,02Alright
when are they ever good?
As per the earlier episode
Aawww, i love this episode!! But im in a raiddd D:
die, trikie's haters!
I challenge TG&P Trixie to a pokemans battuhl
trixie's*
thehated5689: I will use that excuse the next time I need one
I dunno. I thought it was Punny. :D
11,01Ow, your horn is pointy.
i love that sound
OH GOD
"I...I- Moustache!"
>:xc
DON'T play NUTS on the TABLE
:9
DASHIEEEE
<3333
XD
must resist temptation to kick Placebo...
must be strong
does anypony know what time it is where Wrek lives?
T-T
you can do it Dusky
I love her umad face
I love RD.
i just thought of something epic!!
brb guys i need to... umm... Moustache!
Trixie comes back and learns how to leverage her illusion and show powers and not be a colossal douche at the same time
what does derpy's cutie mark mean?
who doesn't love RD
/me 13pokes nittany in the side with her horn
13poke~
Trixie
yep she sure is
duh.
RD is best pony
SONIC THE HEDGEHOG VS RAINBOW DASH!!!
/me loves Dusky
I think so.
11,01Ow.
Speaking of which.
Isn't Wrek swedish? if so, it's 0:13 am there
Shizuka! <3 wub
heya Luna
DC is best pony.
Fersan she is good at being bubbly?
thing.
RD wins
13canary~<3
06I run the twitter, und am around always to tweet before BMN, though I would not mind somepony having access to it if they really want to update it.
11,01Shizuka, watch where you put that thing.
You have a favorite, I'm assuming, Placebo?
/me 13hugs LadyCanary <3
Hiya Luna!
hahaha
Of the mane 6? I dunno.
/me hugs Shizuka back
anything you can DO
can you bake a pie?
/me hugs LadyCanary
(i can do anything better then you)
Anything you can do, I can do better
I'd narrow it down to RD, FS, or AJ.
so Luna, went back to sleep after ponies
CHALLENGE ACCEPTED
trixie is now a sideshow for a carnival
Â¬_Â¬
anything I can do I can do better than you
/me hugs VioletVanilla <3
Oh Trixie.
:1
brought my total sleep up to 19h >_<
Be back later everypony gunna watch new episode on big screen now enjoy your Trixie episode she's so great and...uh...powerful kthnxbai
I can do anything better than you*
Oh, there is a VioletVanilla here? And a Shizuka.
wait
there's a NO EPISODE
that's why I like Ponies Reharmonized Trixie, it's a nice peice of fanon that makes it where Trixie is such a self-aggrandizer because he is the middle child out of 5 near-identical fillies and was entirely average at every field of magic
13where?
HOLY F........UUU
i hate trixie so much
The wub has been doubled?
NEW EPISODE3
See ya HeavyMetalDash!
Fleur i don't think it is an ability
NO YOU CAN'T :P
After this, new episode, I'm assuming?
Ah well.
I can srand up :3
right there
0,5I could help out too with that, if really needed.
xD
in other words, she's so incredibly average she has to be self-aggrandizing ot get notices
10,02(I would like to actually help with that)
8,1or maybe allow all streamers to update the twitter
*noticed
I would have given her a mustash
Done...turned out quite well.
Fersan it is when you are that bubbly
but she's not as bad as Gilda..
Fazana: Wow. You derp'd those lyrics somethin' fierce.
Trixie annoys me :/
11,01Ok.
yeah
11,01That's nice.
8,1or have a seperate "what we are streaming at the moment" twitter, that also serves as a mini stream backlog
I can't remember the song proberly
11,01Get off of the stage.
06I had an idea for, when somepony begins streaming, it auto-tweets.
xP
13^
oh ye of little faith
plus I can't type for shizzle tonight
oooh a flying rope
8,1i could integrate that into the site no problem too
13among other things when someone starts a stream, i'll get to that when it's my turn
Cars are now canon, as per the new episode, so I assume that Ferrari would be a top-selling automobile in Euestria.
but it isn't good
11,01I could do the Twitter.
Guys, shout out when you see Derpy.
STRUT THAT ASS STRUT THAT ASS
precisely my problem with this
gilda is worse than this witch
11,01Oh, nvm.
YES IT IS, DASHIE
dash shows off al lthe time
She was in the crowd a minute ago.
RAINBOOM PLOX
trixie cant do a sonicrain boom
06Well, everypony calm down, talk details a little later. Keep going with Embeds
Interior Crocodile Alligator
Gilda makes me want to- *suddenly shuts up as she screaches to a halt*
0,5Several of us want to help the twitter, heheh.
nevermind
it's like your ability is being ugly
double rainbow
HNNNNNNNGG
(I drive a Chevrolet Movie Theatre)
<Dat Dash
I saw her
top right of the croud
See what I did there?
I'm losing my mind.
she didnt beat rainbow dash! She humiliated her
Soon I'll be talking to the wallpaper again.
Nnope.
she didnt do the same thing
Quick, throw her some cardboard!
10,02As far as I'm aware, only the techies and admins have access to swap embeds on the site. This can be fine in most cases, but at times, it can be very problematic at those times when none are available. It also makes it difficult for streamers to use their preferred stream embed (mainly between FMLE and LiveStream). What it comes down to is it would be great to allow Ops/Streamers the
10,2ability to swap embeds with ease. It prevents any problems when admins/tech aren't online and makes streamers happy being able to use either LS or FMLE.
D=
exactly C0DEW0LF. That is all Trixie does
rainbow dash may be a show off..but she's a likeable show off..trixie is just an idiot!!
:|
RARITY :D <3
i know
Bitch, Please.
3rd person

Pinkie would break Trixie's magic

( she just let trixie get the best of her, didnt she? ) :P

Well, I never..
What, don't like the third person?
8,1i'm currently workign on a BS admin plugin
carrot top diss in 5 4 3 2 1
*throws a Ford Excursion at Trixie*
8,1for stuff like that
khaki hair?
lol
LOL
Sheesh.
Rarity dear, green isnt your color.
T_T
11,01Yeah. It would be nice if more ops had control of the stream.
carrot top?
Confound these ponies
On embeds though, I was thinking of making them auto-update when the embed is changed
this is the worst possible thing ever!
For BS 2.0
umad
Come at me, sis.
10,02That would be great to have as well
So you don't have to shout refresh at people.
10,02^
Eeyup.com

yeppa
Call upon the laundry ponies
07,01any other questions?
I like Trixie.
twilight is just a coward
*shoots Trixie with twin rail guns*
even more so than fluttershy
Snails = derp
trixie do not want
Epic website.
http://www.eeyup.com/
gilda did teach me a lesson though..
Eeyup
xDD
Fleur thinks that people who speak in 3rd person are arrogant fools. Fleur is speaking in 3rd person to prove a point. Dont think that Fleur thinks she is better than you. Fleur does not think she is better than you.
Now you see, why didn't they get offended by Snails and his dopy voices and whatnot.
goodnight guys
07,01none?
Oh silly Fleur xD
Best site on the interwebs.
OMG
07,01okay moving on then
9,1a viewer once suggested a drop down menu of embed sources as well
GRIFFONS ARE BUNGHOLES!!!
That is epic
oh you
I watched him saying that
Then,
good night arrow
What? Do you guys think i just say random things? =/
I read Sweet Apple Massacre.
9,1just putting it out there. Go on.
you fool.
*facehoof*
She says as she tries to enforce the no capslock rules.
10,02That could cause some confusion as to what embed to use.
bungholes... hehe...
/me coughs
And I'm like.
who
gnight arrowtobroknee
8,1that could be done by polling the server every, say, 30 seconds; but that means at high load times we'd have, for example, 5,000 requests every 30 seconds, on average
THIS IS SO FUNNY
...
Spike. He should be a lawyer.
I LEIK PUDDING :3
ok..sry
pudding :P
There are no penises in MLP!
I like pudding. LOL
=D
sigh... oh spike
Or um....other ends
10,02What?! Why don't they sell fleas?!
Spike probably has a bunch of law books in the library
Then having a button on the stream panel
o.o
OBJECTION.
That too.
Saying 'refresh'.
8,1NewDCD: i'm not a great fan of that idea. it's more hassle to check each embed than it is just to refresh the page
he is going to be a walking Encyclopedia by the time he reaches Dragon Adolescence
why are you so oblivious spike?
ugh
Let's go back to proving random things. LOL
IDK if u DK
Well he has a point.
(S2E10 not withstanding)
Okay
they do sell fleas. they just dont advertise thatthey are there
So when the stream needs refreshing they can press that button.
Oh...That's why nobody bought stuff at my flea market...
K
Agreed
Hey all.

Indeed
We made good progress with the whole cars and natural gas argument..
nopony jim..nopony..
So, we're watching MOAR PWNY?
Yep.
Lets continue.
07,01one can never have ENOUGH ponies
wait, RawketLawnchair. Who used caps?
need moar evidence.
Yes let's
Someone needs to write this down.
It still means telling them they have to press the refresh button of course, but they don't have to refresh the page.
:)
She can spontaneously create matter. I'm not certain CELESTIA can do that.
/me gets her shoe ready
And put it on EQD or something.
11,01Here comes the space bear.
My point exactly.
oh wait
Sounds like a car engine
SPAAAAACE BEAR
I don't have any pape-...wait a minute
/me throws a shoe at BlueDWarrior "No allcaps!"
Stars live in caves?
Derpy Boys :)
Spaaaace
eeyup

FALCON KICK
Stars live in Caves, Bears must live in the sky.
Canon.

que?
Falcon kick that rock
whats rebecca black doing here?
forgot an 'a' in Spaaaaaace
o nvm
lol
They're a little Derpy, these two.
I am going to be afraid if Fleur ever gets mod powers.
000 isn't very good at telling us how much of the bandwidth limit we're using either.
ursa minor to be exact!
Fleur Was that the shoe that DCD wears on his head?
No.
8,1still, during a pony episode, that could mean 100,000 http requests in 20 minutes. i'm not saying that will be a problem, but depending on 000's setup, it could be
Placebo, that came out before I even thought of it.
=D
If you've used something like 80% they send an email, but you can't find out any other way
11,01Twilight. Space bear.
Nice...
Lol
o.o
07,01that's odd..
Also, Snails is best pony.
twilight is so irresponsible... letting a baby dragon out at night all by itself
Gah, she never refers to herself in the first person, does she? ;)
cheese it
Space bear. Twilight.
Snails is derpy
This was the shoe that has never been worn so it is still very stiff
Trixie's homeless
Now they've met
Space Bear is pissed
/me really thinks the design of the usea minor is awesome.
Was that a Jurassic Park Reference? with the trees falling over by an unseen force? Nice!
ursa*
LadyCanary This.
eeyup
I do too LadyCanary
06c;
Oh thank god
We should probably look into a paid host at some point.
/me hugs LadyCanary
^_^
ugh
Bears have Cutie Marks on their foreheads.
the stream is back
*insert space core joke here*
they are incredible
:(
I wanna say it again

HUHUHUH, AYE LAEIK PUDDING!
i never understood why one would do that
GUYS
Cavy: where ya goin' with that..
Trixie: I am a Show Magic Unicorn not a Magi Unicorn D:
Trixie has at least the will to fight the Ursa
lol
We discovered quite a bit in RD chat.
LadyCanary: you know, there's something you should know.
Most recent discovery:
/me glares at Cavy "what?"
11,01Space bear: "Nope."
eh
i missed it :(
LadyCanary: and i'm gonna tell you so.
Oh man. VioletVanilla is winking at us.
What is that RAWRity?
Stars live in caves, therefore Bears live in the sky.
Canon/
LadyCanary: you know what...don't sweat it.
:$
well the ursa is almost, if not completely snips and snails fault ._.
Forget it
Umm..
/me tilts head
Trixie: Darriny you two! Im a magic mare, not a Magic mare!
LadyCanary: enjoy the show.
Derpy made several lightning strikes at once... Derpy > trixie
That's a bit of a stretch there, Cavy .
Sorry, stars have cutie marks on their foreheads.
I missed the newest episode :(
Not to be critical-- but those two are MORONS.
ujelly
did u see the newest ep?
Space Bear... Hungry
Say whaaaa
-either*
dont feel bad sonicxsx. I did too <3
XD
Not quite RawketLawnchair.
i did s well
/me likes Trixie's design but /hates/ her personality
Space bear
anyone who missed S2E15 thats what youtube is for
Look better? When were you better to begin with?
Because the only people it would refresh for are people who are AFK and haven't seen that they have to press the refresh button in the IRC.
06ja. .
I have a DVR and I wasn'r afraid to use it.
06aber I am ignored X3
.. love and tolelrate ppl
Ermm...

Moooooooooooooo...sick
So stars foreheads are their asses?
I'm not quite sure...

Cute bear <3

Anyway
Let's save it for the tech meeting. ;___;
I think mine would e a Gundam or the BMW logo
a gun for me
Oh
I got this.
I wont ignore you Vi... But I dont see what you said before that so...
So many meetings.
Let's see... they have metal and glass.. Which means they somehow mine the earth for ores, and probably have a beach for harvesting sand..
13vivi.. vivivivivivi... you are nicht ignored... i love you
I'm going to need years of therapy.
^
Awwwwwww!!!
9,1movung on?
wow taht was some precision
04What is this place filled with so many meetings~
They say Thank Celestia, and For the love of Celestia.
BOOOOOOM
being able to levitate a water tank and milk cows at the same time
Carrot's hair is orange again
So, probably said before, but.
It's a strech just as much saying "OMG HOURGLASS CUTIE MARK = DR WHO REFERECNE LOLOL'
Celestia is god.
lol
I do not like it.
What does that make Luna?
No.
Just chuck testa
11,01Space bear defeated.
hey, doctor whooves is awesome
Like I said-- I'm not certain Celestia herself could pull some of this stuff off.
10,02I think I still have some of my bones left in tack...
Also, hello there, VioletVanilla. You are smart and sexy and we love you.
DERPY who els saw her
Help

Ooooohfff.
Yea...
10,02I think that was already taken care of...
13nope
G3 RD scared me too.
Rainbow Dash always dresses in style~
btw Dr. Whooves was more because how he looks vs. what his cutie mark is
2,14 that one's really simple, and already taken care of (mostly)
Hm...
What's it meant to be addressing?
This one is pro.
The cave entrance looks just big enough for the ursa minor, so....how does the ursa major get in and out of there? O_o
basically she is still ditzy doo in this episode
G3 Rareity was REALLY scary
Magic.
13it's the first topic on my list too, flags are not synced in all channels
just the needed flags in each of the rooms for the new additions
It doesn't.
10,02Giving everyone Ops / Hops in all of the rooms.
derpy
Oh right.
Or perhaps there's another entrance?
Ursa minor does all the hunting and shit.
what was the name of it? im trying to remember it, but cant for the life of me
The more I watch the older episodes, the more I notice
10,02This was before it was decided on.
angry derpy
07,01ok
fucking spiders
no need to discuss it really, just needs to be brought to attention (done)
:O!!!
ugly
07,01the teaminput ist done then

Well I need to talk to an IRCop about it, because since I broke their services, flags aren't setting right.

Wait.
Ursa Major gets pissed.... your town is pretty screwed short of divine intervention

I swear I have been singing the theme song out of nowhere by memory
Hey, it wasn't allcaps

I used too, but now she's just sucking jupt to the mods just by going 'herp derp no allcaps'
10,02I'm for the ornament.
0,5Mine is a hammer and banana if you need to know. (Totally not a communist or anything)
11,01I can send you mine after the meeting (the one done in paint).

Well the new mod info can be settled later.
I just discovered this as well, Placebo.

I don't know if it's sucking up or not
Heroic Mc

SPAM for short
HNNNNNGGGG
13next, still with mods page, shall i reorganize into two sections, one for current/active mods, one for past mods?
/me pulls out a horseshoe and spins it on her finger "that so Kira_Pony_Yamato?"
*Squee*
Whym thank you, Siniczsu.
Bunny bloom is best pony.
10,02What's the purpose of the bunny outfits?

Cannot type tonight.
Tradition SB
You make one word all caps in your sentence and she'll be like ZOMG NO CAPS FOLLOW RULES GAIZ
Because APPLE BLOOM in a bunny outfit is so precious <3
It's what the Zap Apples like best.
11,01Yeah.
11,01I would.
look everyone its veruca salt..
Hmm
*arms nuclear warhead, while holding a gernade in left hand* Indeed
It makes the apples happy and the jam taste better.
11,01Current from past at least.
The mods can do that since well, they are the mods.
8,1(and tech!)
graor
07,01^
Fleur is just . .. ngrhg.
from willy wonka?
07,01most important!

I'll stop venting for now. Enjoy the show.
Technically, the bunny suits seem to cheer up the water. Magic is as magic does.
the brat?
13und techies~
0,5Admins?
SuperBrony64: to provide the HNNNNNGGG attacks.
10,02O U
Fleur: they tuck them between their legs
13so we would have Current IRC Mods, Current Forum Mods, Current Techies, Past Mods
I'm back
9,1I'd say, personally, scratch past mods, divide into IRC and Forums
MMmm...what an experience ^_^ The last of my egg nog, Ponies & Zap apples.
I'm just amazed that they can pose like bunnies
07,01^
Yeah.

ROHKARA: Or move their ears o.O
10,02Dat Doctor Whooves

/me puts SB64 in bunny outfit, commence the HNNNNNGGG attacks
/me blames otakon
I'm scared
must be really hard to sit like that
0,5But there are only like 4 forum mods, so it's not very evenly divided.
Past mods can be mentioned in the history section
00,06All of the current full OPs will be both IRC and forum.

Twilight wasn'r fat-- she was stuffed. There's a difference.
It's on Youtube
The channels to be in are BS, main6, regulars, #derpy_hooves and #vinyl_scratch
Rainbow Dash is fat.
many thanks. I'm curious as to what our intentions are with #BSR and #Lobby, they basically fill the same roles, and as such it's not really necessary to have both
Ha ha.
right :(
LIAR
If you're a mod, #luna too.
Rd is fatest pony.
For apples, they sure have a lot of black magic signs
07,01lobby is kinda dead lately

05,15maybe kill it, and make a new secret regulars room
11,01Should we key the room?

I don't see why
Now I'm thinking of how Applebloom's voice actor must've had fun doing that part.
well, lobby is dead
where is the shoe?
0,5Why key it?
so that means we wouldn't NEED to remake a room
How has this portion of the episode not turned into some twisted BigmacxCheerilee ship?
10,02We already have a secret room, it's #lobby
13no no, regulars is still very low volume relative to mane chat, especially when it's needed most on movie night
If you got in there, you've stayed around long enough to be a regular.
It's fine.
^
no idea
watering the sheep, seems legit
So
Onwards
yeah
10,02Just make sure not to talk about it freely.
never seen someone water sheeps?
13so next topic, we the halfops
fiddlesticks CAWCAW
FAMILY SNATCHING DAYYY
brushie brushie
I must return to my people.
that blow would have knocked somepony unconsious
I must go, my planet needs me
Give it time, Placebo
Cheerilee is a clueless teacher
13what shouldn't we do without trying to get a fullop first?
fiddledicks? wut
wakes her up
And there's a lot of tea in Canterlot.
sticks Sammy, sticks
Sammy: no, fiddlesticks!
Cypresswolf: I'm sure it's being worked on, somewhere.
lol?
^ dat phrasing
dat Sweetie Face!
13i know we've been going over a lot of use your judgment, but if there's things we definitely shouldn't do on our own, we need to know
10,02Dat DAAAAAAAWABLE Sweetie Belle is just DAAAAW ^_^
gods I love it so!
rainbow
hehe
trolololo
Double negatives are the bane of language.
Big MacXCheerilee fic? That's being saved for the actualy show.
Double Rainbow...
Seems... legit?
AWWWW YEAHH!
rainbow overload
Those are some cool apples :P
xD
triiple rainbow
The Rainbow has been Double!
lol
Over-rainbow.
I want rainbow apples
11,01Double negatives are the rule in Spanish.
13for instance, halfops *can* ban, but i am told we shouldn't
RD seal fo approval
penta rainbow
the Aurora Rainbowalis
Just don't ban anyone without speaking to an op first.
scootatard
What does it *mean*?
scootigram
Wait til the valentine episdoe airs, this chat will be going nuts, of that im certain!
Rainbow Dashis actually the cause for the zap apples, but she moves too fast for anyone to realize
Who uses telegrams anymore?
Bitch slap
slap
06Dont not go get an op if you cant not find one
..
...
Just a lot of rainbows. That's all.
karmatehwolfie: the ponies, they don't have phones
ponies
I know I will.
...
karmatehwolfie: ponies
13yfw i understood that fine ^ :P
Ponies don't have phones.
Lawl Vi.

trollfaxe
Even if they did.. Hooves? Hello?
fail
fat pony behind DT
Dat face.
Ipony. xDD
13i'll assume we can always find a fullop on SRS?
If they're posting R34 like there's not tomorrow or are running a spam bot, and there are no mods around, then you can ban them.
dat diamond teirra face
placebo dial with their tongues!
10,02Noogie noogie noogie
cloppingtheiphony?
Apple Strudel, oy...
10,02:>
RAWRity: That can't be hygenic.
04Halfops aren't allowed to ban
PONIES: The Anthology = Too funny.
uncle apple stroodle is best pony
dat lederhosen
ololo
Oh... I SENSE A BAD TWILIGHT SPARKLE SPELL-PHONE PUN.
10,02le gasp
13and then the debate was contested, this is why i bring it up
04It was the rule first established when we moved to irc
Apple-Sauced.
Placebo: the bowl with their mouths. Ponies don't give a BUCK about hygeine
Diamond Tiara= Rich BITCHYwh***?
I want to try a zapapple
/me gasp
Awwwwww lil Granny Smith <3
I might get an electric shock from it
04Halfops can kick, warn, whatever but they cannot ban...typically
That's what I said.
Electric hurts me like hell :c
Canterlot!
It's only a model....
/me 's head explodes
04I think for live eps there should be an exemption made
apple smith
Dem braids.
best castle twn ever
RAWRity: Come to think of it, walking around all those hooves all day, then eating with them can't be healthy..
Canterlot, it is a silly place
*town
04I think for live eps, halfops should be given authority
Praise the Sun!
selling old seeds - do old seeds still grow?
MOLESTIA
no
bronycon:twice
She was probably called "Baby" Smith at the time.
Wait...just how old is celestia? O.o
If there are no full ops around and someone is spamming R34/running a spambot, half ops can ban.
how old is granny smith supposed to be?
how did i do that?
I love how fighting is magic has an AJ recolor that is Granny's pallet
Over 1000 years old.
Uhhh
Dashie: at least 1000 years
can someone help me?
WELL over.
Jealousy.
This is probably like 70 years ago this coolstory
dat mighty thanks
Dashie: at LEAST 2000 yrs. old
04But there's almost always a full op around these days
bro:ken
Yep.
seems legit
lol
That's why it's only if there aren't.
so she's probably older than 70
No pony should ever pony pony
Does that mean, Granny Smith's parents were *gasp* Flim Flammers?
Most likely
Not likely
Cypresswolf: no
Nah.
0,5I assume ops can authorize us to ban, like DCD did that one time for the Vinyl_Scratch guy?
Could happen though
8,1i think the rule here is: never try not to get an op if there isn't nothing that needs attending that you can't do without no ratification
Huh? o3o
So just getting the circumstances set up
Dashie: Not even Close to how old Discord is
Grey hair, quite crippled
04It should only be for live eps that they're given the ability to ban
Cypresswolf: eenope
and she went AT NIGHT
The Bacon Brothers
why?
Dat Rarity Break
horrible alzheimers
1,3what's up?
man
well I can understand discord being the same age and being able to live for all those years
04You guys are halfops for a reason, and not being allowed to ban is a key part of that
the music makes this scene
they are RD apples
he was turned into a statue afterall
brb
04If you're allowed to ban, then why keep halfops around?
Get your little pony shotgun!
lol
Seems legitamate
otakon: because Granny Smith don't give a buck.
great pun
what should i have for dinner...lol irrelivant
Granny Get your Gun!
Timberwolves... OH THE PUNS
ORBITAL NUKE INBOUND
KILL IT WITH FIRE!
1,3:p
how about some zapapples
07,01apples!
Granny, light a fire
[23:47] If there are no full ops around and someone is spamming R34/running a spambot, half ops can ban.
I stand by that
OMFG
Get it? Like, "Annie"?
11,01For extra help.
there wildfire in mlp
13i second
07,01applesauce with potatoe wedgies
06. . Summary. No bans unless absolutely necessary. All other reasons, see OP on page 637 of your manual.
04That ruins the whole motive
9,1That was basically asking you to be my proxy for that specific banning though, since I had to get going at that moment.
I want apples that grow quicker than lickity split
:|
hmm
04We may as well get rid of halfops
/me throws boots at Dashie_Dashie, BronyCon, and karmatehwolfie "No allcaps damnit!"
Granny's got a gun.
07,01dat manual
13if there are no fullops around and we have to take action, our hands are tied otherwise ghosties
lol
fine fancy pants
o hai again Fleur
I wan't all caps D:
9,1Halfops=Interns
10,02As far as I know, halfops have all the abilities of regular ops minus the ability to kick Ops...right?
04Then that's why I'm proposing to get rid of halfops
and then Fleur was Wrek
06Fleur dear, calm calm. .
wasn't*
10,02Technically speaking I mean
maggots
13SuperBrony64: and changing modes / topic
You're making this way bigger than it is Ty.
I was half caps.
buh dum tsst
/me calms down
If there are no full ops around.
06Aber everypony, please do not allcaps. . .
was to i think
/me hugs Fleur tight
I'm hungry for an apple now :c
I was half-caps earlier...
And someone is spamming the chat with R34.
04You're taking a key thing of halfops and going "we're gonna act like you can't ban...BUT YOU REALL CAN"
Are they supposed to do nothing?
/me 13hugs vivi und fleur~
Sorry...
/me gives RD Salute
04Come on
Silverspoon's face is just awesome here
aaay!
/me giggles
/me hugs VioletVanilla and Shizuka <3
ohai Vi
04Just be done with halfops
No, come on yourself.
opa!
04NO U
0,5o__O
If Heaven doesn't have rainbow apples, I search the universe for them
Pwned.
0,14Guys.
:$
06karmatehwolfie: not mad sweetie (: only letting you know ja?
cool story bro
>_<
clop
arkwarsd sounds
04But seriously, that's a major focal point of halfops
clop?
Dat epic story
You can't just expect them to sit there and do nothing if no full ops are around.
11,01CLop to the old lady.
Their faces = my face when i first watched this
clop
07,01guys.. we're almost done
(True story)
...
clAp!
DoEs ThIs CoUnT aS hAlF cApS?
04Notify an op?
:O
04Is it that hard to do?
07,01but there's almost ALWAYS an op around
lol
8,1can i just say, all bans are seen by admins, and verified, right? so there shouldn't really be any reason for half-ops not being able to ban. if you trust people enough to kick, you should trust them enough to ban, otherwise they wouldn't have been invited to be on staff
Granny smith made ponyville
troll
Ty.
WHAT
its canon
dundundun
Better than clopping to Fillies.
Half caps is a pain to read
throw the brick
mmmmm chalk
04Don't WHAT me
I just said "If there are no full ops around"
You can't notify them
They're all gone
NONE
Everyone licks boards
And
...sometimes.
You
half caps is most annoying caps
mabye
I mean none of Skype
dat mushy cheek
*throws nti-matter gernade*
are gonna die
None on IRC
pull the lever
04If there are no ops in BRONYSTATE
None
still dont understand that random chalk licking...
Anywhere
okay, mabye she is just a tad crazy
well, she's sort of both.
04And I'm talking about Skype
anti-matter*
06^ It has happened before.
TOAEST
10,02Dat Dumbo
3... I think the world must have ended if that were the case...
WingedCurse: Have you tasted chalk?
i like appleblooms eye color
That's delicious
If there are none online using the internet, or with any form of live comuncication at all Ty.
still watching episodes?
04My point is, just get rid of halfops
Yes
Jim: nope
Oh my dear God.
okeh ^_^
*throws anti-matter gernade*
Amazing granny. So sweet, the sound.
04If you're all so adamant about it, then I'm telling you to be done with it
NO
Y U NO get zapapple cutiemark
/me only throws shoes and boots because she doesnt want people to get in the habbit of all capsing.
his cutie mark...what is it? The table's corner is in the way
You'll notice they all share colours
im going back to watching miracle then
04Because we don't do this shit halfass
wubububu
no cutie mark eh?
8,1Ghosties: i think that's a god idea
I want to try a zapapple...
Oh god
lol k
?
/me hates to wach a pony get kicked from the chat
scootabunny is cutest
Anyon?
I do believe AB's eye color is just the inverted colors of Granny Smith's
I just Squeed
LOL
But maaaaaahm
/me 11,01Fleurs
PLAYBOY
*Anyone
stupid upload keeps breaking all ma stuff
8,1*good
Be careful apple family! Some people may come along with some machine to make zap apple jam faster! D:
04Either halfops with no ability to ban (except for on live eps) or only ops
11,01?
yah
Trolololololol
1,3hmm?
:D
just asking if anyone chatted
I think that the series will end with the CMC getting their Marks
You don't get what I'm saying.
It's YouTube, you can't expect it to work as expected
u mean s2?
that is weird... when Nittany_Discord pings me it doesnt ping me
10,02Alright! Time for the restream of this morning's episode
Hey, how long is this pony watching going on?
I'm not saying if there aren't any full ops on IRC.
series? end? what u talkin bout?!
like hell we do ^_^
RaveBrony: and they'll be driven out of town because MLP is AGAINST THE FREE MARKET ECONOMY!
yay
woohoo
YAY!!
1,3lol
AWW YEAHHH
04You want a failsafe, I got that
soo....olnly 5 more days
Exactly.
Lol!!! RAWRity xD
04I understand what you're saying
Assuming the Flim Flam Brothers know how to make zap apples in the first place
after that restream then we'll be allowed to talk about it
"only"
<3
UGH. 5 WHOLE DAYS
NEW EP!
indeed
04But that defeats the purpose of a halfop not being allowed to ban
Leggo!
look at that
WOOHOO
"Only?!?"
This is true, Cypresswolf
04It defeats the principle
My Little Communism: The State is Magic
Well so does letting them ban during a pony episode
fluttersleep
/me restrains herself from throwing shoes
New episode time
kool
Nah, the series. The CMC are going to be blank for the forseeable future, since the lesson is "Wait for good things"
Ooh
lol
Dat fluttershy! ;P
low quality?
Now episode
lol, the bad quality stream
lol
*squeak*
*squee*
lol i saw this, this moarning
lawl
04There's a difference there because we have around 3,000 people as opposed to...what, 250?
first minute and already shipping.
the HD version is uploaded...
its the only one thats on youtube
I'm so exited i feel like shouting. Whoo-hoo!
sideways flying!
oh no she naked
1080p is out
11,01I can imagine someone putting a beer song to this episode.
btw
Beg Pardon, Fluttershy... But we don't Normally Wear Clothes.
cider= achohol
what one are we watching
this episode sinches it, Apple Family confimred for Socialists.
faceplant
never saw this ep
Nittany_Discord: There is a song called "Beer!"
O_o
07,015000+ lately
pegasi are apparently part hummingbird
wait
/me squints
cider
04Exactly
Rainbow Dash x Fluttershy = awesome
And 250/3000 makes no difference if with the 250 there's one guy with a spam bot that's sending 10 messages every second.
there are HD versions uploaded now
Pinkie Pie has such epic bed hair
What is the malted liquor? What gets you drunker quicker?
dat instant hair fix!
they are against healthy competion Next thing you know, they'll be telling Mayor Mare they're "too big to fail"!
Or something spamming text walls of R34.
was a pretty good ep this morning, seems like hasbro has really stepped it up recently, the latest eps have had us all surprised several times
What comes in bottles and in cans?
Pinkie's static style hair :P
8,1or posting r34
someone*
07,01this is the episode from today
This episode also shows that Equestria has no Open Container laws.
07,01enjoy
pinkie gets crazier each episode
Rainbow Rage!
oh
pwny
kay
04Look, either only ops or halfops with no ban ability
she is somad
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-lets-get-to-that-party-quick.gif Goes will with the intro
baby cakes, last round up (derp), latest
04It was one of the key features of a halfop when we started out
You heard it here on True Free Canterolist Radio!
im gettings my 'friends' ready now
freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeenz!
Frieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeendssss!
XD
8,1Ghosties: can i ask, what's the point of having half-ops that can't ban in the first place?
I win
I just don't understand why you object to a failsafe.
FRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANCE
..
/me loves how Fluttershy got embarased when RD woke her up
Next week is Read it & Weep, right?
throw shoe!
06Think of halfops as a normal citizen with a gun. You are not allowed to kill someone unless you must. Otherwise, consult an admin before quickscope.
Hehe
damn that cyder must be good
yep, wolf
Me too Fleur :3 :3
Cypresswolf: eeyup
I think so, Cypress wolf
huzzah!
Fleur: well, she's embarrasd that she sleeps in the nude!
Squee!
rawrity, they're the single biggest business in ponyville and are probably the single biggest income for the town. Them shutting down could be a pretty big problem to the town as a whole.
Lawl Vi
Oh god
Lol, RAWRity xD
now i can't unhear it
hey, anybody know if on facebook you can send someone a private message even if you're not friends with them?
04Allowing them to use ban "but only when there's no one else around" is an insult to what a halfop is. It is completely derooting that principle
pwny...
wait wat
Nice! 1 more week ^_^
They don't normaly wear clothes
06I am being serious.
Ijust imagined Twist saying "Cider Season"
i just finished watching this lol
RAWRity: but they don't normally wear clothes(Applejack voice)
looks like beer
04We started out with that "no banning allowed." You take that away, you're stripping the heirarchy
Lol xP
Thider Theathon
also, I better not hear a single spoiler *narrows her eyes threateningly
So is 'allowing them to ban but only when there's loads of people around'
frothy cider
11,01I wonder how long will this episode stay up before it's copyright claimed.
Fleur: you we be AMAZED
8,1Ghosties: do we really need that much heirarchy?
they're all alcoholics...
download it ahead of time
she just had the so awsome face
06^
Nittany_Discord: I give it three days
wow
04You are essentially neutering what it means to be a halfop
Dermathil: that's just what those socialist liberals want you to believe! Mayor Mare is against small business in equestria!
Nittany_Discord: usually you can find a few episodes that stay up, not all of them get taken down immediately
Poor Rainbow Dash!
Rainbow rage
T_T no RD
It's also so you see how we enforce our rules.
aww
Wah wah wah.
Rainbow Rage
riot
Typical fluttershy :(
Poor Rd is feening
Nittany_Discord: the 480- ones seem to go unhindered, while Xyro's seem to last about a week before they get nixed.
lol
RIOT!
she got cider
I need my Fix man!
I need my cider
but they have TONS of apples...
If you have no idea how strict/lenient we are on certain things you might be way too harsh or the opposite.
not enough
I need it!*shakes*
indeed they do
13ghosties, i have the floor
Song Song Song Song Song!!! Nowwww
/me hopes the stream stops skipping on her
hey
WingedCurse: it takes time to make it is all
sorry guys, going to lurk and watch this properly now, see y'all after this episode :)
Why don't they do this in advance? It ferments
00,06What dari said.
what?
Pinkie Pie is being a bitch
see ya Dashie
8,1aye, let's move on and talk about this tomorrow or something
10,02lol Pinkie: U MAD?
ragerageragerage
Pinkie be trolling RD for being left in the desert.
I'd shoot Pinkie right now
MEXICANS INCOMING!!! AHHHH..hold on, I have nothing agaisn't Mexians. :(
RD gonna smash Pinkie
LOL Pinkie ; w ;
poor dash

so effin mad dash is
Seatbelts, Everyone!
I LOVE it
Rainbow Rage inbound
never again
00,06>endlessly long meeting
11,01I thought this episode mirrored two game publisher. Fim Flams = Activision. Apple Family = Valve.
Tovler: dam
I admit, I would have shot Pinkie in the face
00,06>save some of it for tomorrow
you know....had a thought...pinkie is definitely not the element of generousity, she bought a ton of cider...yet shares none with RD
13excuse me
I agree...pinkie has become TOO random
And here somes the Music Man redesigned.
00,06...what
oooooooooookkkkkkkk
/me buckles up
13i have the floor
O_o
Rawrity: and Mayor Mare needs money from Applejack's prizes to fix the town roof. Also, quills and sofas and sugarcube corner are other examples.
00,06Apologies, continue.
Nittany_Discord: you and your videogame parable
trolltrain
And we finish the discussion of each point before moving on
Bacon manes!
thats some bad parking skills
lol Nittany_Discord
Activison = terrible game makers.
ikr Ingwaz
Nittany_Discord: indeed. The Apple family can't count to 3 either.
We don't just have one person decide when to move onwards.
I love this song
/me turns off the stream and closes the chat as she goes to youtube to watch
me too otakon
...Oh my gosh.
I just had a thought; what if Rarity and Pinkie Pie are trying to make sure Rainbow Dash doesn't get cider
10,02lol They have bacon hair
Applewood-cured bacon hair
new song ahh yea
Those clothes!
Otherwise nothing gets decided
SuperBrony64: yes they do
yes!
cant unsee SB64
cya later Fleur
LC approves
it makes me sad...i got taken in by these two...then i realized mid way that theyre conmen...
g2g by!!
We need to come to a conclusion
i swear this whole scene is a reference to some movie...just can't remember the name
I didnt make the connection to Music Man...been long time since I've seen it
so which one has the mustache?
i didn't know LordCelestia was in this show!
Bacon mane SuperBrony64
10,02Bai fluttershyfan158!
/me bounces up and down
SuperBrony64, they're LC's children
flim or flam?
11,01Activision: Quantity and profit over quantity. Valve = taking time for their projects.
Ingwaz: that's how it works
10,02O U
Telling you-- I've SEEN this movie.
ive already watched this
See ya, fluttershyfan158

No idea

Derpy
Mine's already ponied
Suddenly, LC out of nowhere
i saw her too
/me does a knee dance
this song is so catchy
and their cutie marks match up too
>on hold until tomorrow
Who names their kids "Flim" and "Flam"?!
I have a rainbow background :3
new body shapes!
LordCelestia: well whoops them into shape.
LordCelestia, why didn't you raise them to be good and socialist?
The whole point is to get things that have been on hold forever out of the way
derpy
you are a bad parent
again
Flim: no Moustache Flam: with Moustache
A decision to be made on them
same here
epic voices
Dermathil: not really, it's Post Box's design
I love how they say "FLim Flam brothers" :)
Randomnerd: rednecks?
otakon: oh? Oh well.
i was hoping it would more of a challenge to find her in this episode
i suppose my only respite is that they were not literally selling me something
also, I like how their cutie marks match up.
i have luna background
I've only seen Roseluck in 1 shot so far
WingedCurse: Maybe?
00,06Plus, gathering everyone tomorrow would only be more of a pain.
Rex Harrison Lives as a pony.
DISPENSER
Daniel Ingram has done it again!!
do have to admit, they have style
:D
8,1yes, but i've got some points i want to bring up too, and i need to go soon
10,02Valve: "Every episode we don't see Trixie, we delay Half-Life 3 by a month"
RAWRity: It's pretty clever, yeah
Rarity thinks theyre cute??? What??
it's Billy Mays here!
/me just saw the name of the ep... damn paul bunion ref...

John Henry, Fleur
Randomnerd: also, ponies who want to give their twins theme names.
hmmm, i would enjoy it immensely if valve turned out to be bronies
06Well, it seems that its more of an admin argument. Why not discuss it with the admins, then tell the halfops what you decide?
*sadface*
Flim flam means "to cheat."

I like Hot Cider in the cold
Cider gives me the poots.
Paul Bunion had a contest with a tree cutting machine. He was trying to prove that the quick way is not the best way
see!
ohai otakon

Cider cider cider cider cider!!
Bloodie connies
i just noticed 2 bon bons
i use laptop 2
13proposal: with bronystate 2.0, an irc bot we can command when we start a stream, it goes through all channels and updates the topic to say who is on stream
My goodness, this song is long.
otakon: to be fair, trying to put another company out of business because they won't agree to a crappy business partnership is pretty shady business practices.
>.>
dem dancing is awesoem
I have 2
dat dancing
10,02Derpy!

Laptop and desktop
I freaking LOVE this song!!

Quickfix already has her own Tumblr already
06I like that!
I have my own laptop, but it's not working at the moment, so I am using my work laptop
13most channels i've been in would go... Bronystate Mane Chat | http://bronystate.net | Now Playing: movie night! | something else worthy of going in the topic
can't help it otakon
Scoot-Scootaloo: ponies' pupils dialate when they're happy.
Shit split is shit.

:P
Daniel Ingram is a baws
/me disspears in a big explosion

Lol, Dashie_Dashie
RAWRity, dat tab fail
Dermathil, no outside links please
how bout 60 40
:(
13that same bot, when updating topics, could also go update twitter, and the site
If they don't have
no deal
ikr
or 55 45
kirzstryfe: y so no color
That is very nice, RAWRity
or 50 50
y'know, this is precisely why I'm thinking about changing my nick
Big mac learnt two new words
hell yeah BM!
well this is my first time here
If they don't have apples, how do they manage?
/me is disappointed at the lack of 'Eeeenope'
no deal!
they still get more and stay in buisness
sorry kirz. I had to give ingwaz some proof that steam tech support had bronies in it, and that link was from the nightly roundup 11.
how so?
dun dun DUN
LOL RAWRity
13but in any case, more use of the topics, save us the trouble of answering the same questions when the answers could be above the chat box
lah nooo -_-
1,3the color was chafing :p
big mac is in deal or no deal
they have no apples
exactly
you know what id do
eeyupo
inb4 Macintosh's Deal is incorperated into a Deal or No Deal parody.
and that was the moment when everybody wanted to put a knife in the flim flam brothers
*eeyup
/me 13yields the floor
:O
to prevent tab fails
Ingwaz: agreed
13that's all from me
i usually just chat on kongregate :P
id let them make all the cider they wanted
then...
10,02lol Poor Rainbow Dash
indeed

8,1oh, can someone very quickly fix the topic in the mane channel?
LOL!

Yea

Oh... ha ha. u mad
Roseluck again ^_^

8,1anyhoos

poor fence
Such trolls
8,1if no questions, i'll go
id file a law suit and claim all the barrels if cider that were made with our apples with out our concet
lolwut?
Peat. Peat Moss, who supplies ponyville with gardening supplies.
Oh. Replay of the newest episode. Nice.

Randomnerd: good one
10,02Dat dirt nom

11,01You mean that space?
om nom

I EAT SAND
lol

LOL

8,1you're instead of your

gruuurrr

XF
dang
Dash NEEDS her cider fix!
XD
05,15wrong form of its too
totally a cruel joke
dang
wow it really IS livestream XD
The Universe wants Rainbow Dash clean
Appleholics Anonymous?
10,02Reminds me of Squidward with the Krabby Patty
thats made from our apple so its ours you just made it for us TY
13mfw nittany could... okay good note halfops can change topic... shouldn't be possible with +t though..
dat Fluttershy :(

SuperBrony64: me too
WUB WUB
^SB64
lol
The thing, it is a good machine being operated by... jerks.
derp eyes
wub wub wub
/)^3^(\
SuperBrony64: So much for never seeing a fat pony.
CASE CLOSED.
13anyway, that's my spiel
11,01I don't even think I was allowed to change the topic.
shut up applebloom
Applebloom! STFU!
mrs cake is a bit plump
dat AB face
challenge!
SuperBrony64: ...it does!
8,1right, first of all, streams: this is something i'm going to bring up more next week in the tech meeting, but what are everyone's experiences with stream stability?
exactly
you like cider? don't you rainbow?
Where would Flim & Flam get the apples they need to drive the Apples out of business in the first place? Importing apples from outside Ponyville would drive up their cider price
Scootaloooooo
10,02Pinkie Pie ^-^: You like apple cider, don't you Rainbow Dash?
11,01it's should be its
Scooot
It. Is. ON!
hello silence my old friend
Sup!
dat BTTF reference
10,02O U TheGreatAndPowerfulT
No, That's scoota-- Oh, wait.
Cypresswolf: they steal the apples
oh no he didnt
8,1are we happy with the streaming methods we use at the moment?
11,01Mixed.
Cypresswolf: they are not clever ponies.
ik
granny smith is getting trolled
DO A BARREL ROLL
11,01Most people hate mips for the ads.
the south field
SuperBrony64: :)
exactly
8,1are we happy with the way that ads are served on these platforms?
04HATE mips for the ads
challenge accepted
We make do with what we've got.
No, thye are clever. Just not smart.
If there was a better solution we'd use it
there should be a taste testing portion of the battle
or, they buy out Sweet Apple Acres and set up shop there.
indeed
Well, they should talk to Filthy Rich.
ikr
^^
hehe
Man, those Mexican like Connies are so trolls
11,01Well, I don't see the ads.
alright it works
8,1and should we look into setting up our own streaming server instead?
that would make it fair
ALSO
We have
Hell, I think they had the barrels in reserve
lol im lucky i just finished watching this with my sis turn on the stream to see it again :D
04It's unfortunate that I may have to get adblock, but I'll manage
10,02We certainly have a plethora of options at our disposal so at least we have options when one goes down (like MIPS this morning)
Tear down Sweet apple acres, building shopping mall.
I set up one on Luna's PC
bringing in the big hoofs
ISN'T THIS THE THIRD APPLE EPISODE IN 4?
We represent Pizza Dinosaur...
It's not practical.
i dunno, Filthy Rich seems to have some ties to the Apple Family
Go, Big Macintosh, go!
Go Big Mac GO!
11,01I'm just saying others aren't as lucky or knowing of ad block plus.
steampunk big mac
more pinkie
^^^
<3
/me dons his giant foam finger
more trixie
Zap apple, Apple rodeo and this
lol
/me /)(\ TheGreatAndPowerfulT
GO APPLE FAMILY! Go!
10,02:3
Don't you need a hoof?
The quality was no where near as good as with the online streaming services we use
more flutter
That's HER name!
"They paved Ponyville, and put up a parking lot..."
yeah
07,01^
05,15why couldn't people get adblock plus though, I got it in the middle of movie night and never had another issue
more fluttershy
How would the Apples lose their farm with hundres? of acres of apple trees at the ready? Am I missing something here
And even with Luna's godly internet, probably wouldn't handle the usage.
doctor HOOVES!!
10,02Dat Doctor Whooves
Dat hour glass!!
Doctor Whooves is turning with Time
they r so ready
Agreed!
We had only 1 FS ep yet
8,1i'm just asking should we look into it
RAWRity: Trouble is, if those connections were really strong, the Ponyville Ponies would have dismissed Flim and Flam out of hoof.
the timelord :D
shit just got real
We have though
so freakin awesome
which is Stare Master
That's what I'm saying
Cypresswolf: a bet is a bet, and the apples hold to their word
their bodys are ready
10,02Y U No turn back time and destroy their invention!?
8,1because it's perfectly possible, but there are some other considerations too
11,01Didn't some of your older services get shut down?
And if it involves money it's a no-go too.
lolwut
because they arent aliens
^
SuperBrony64: no Tardis and fixed point
07,01^ dat depends
10,02Poor Applejack ;___;
Trolled
Hey there!
Because we stream copyrighted material the chances are we'll pay for a service and then lose it.
....Holy moley.
*trollface*
Seriously, Mac. Do you really need goggles? It's not like you're moving, the wind can't be that bad.
07,01but let's talk about it during the tech meeting
:[
Hey, is this a new episode
lol
all the faces this episode were awesome
SuperBrony64, i find your lack of faith disturbing
Yes
8,1yeah, that was really leading into my next point
this is THE new episode
Goggles mean srs bsns
lol
And I'm pretty sure earlier on we decided it wasn't worth that risk when the free providers are alright.
Placebo: it#
Placebo: you should ALWAYS wear proper protection when working
Cypresswolf: they rely on selling their Cider to keep afloat through the winter when they can't grow anything. Poor apple sales = Having to sell the farm to afford food.
There are apples splatting all over the place-- I'd wear goggles too.
another applejack one?
hello
oh yea
and ive gotten about sick of applejack
Yeah
3rd one in 4
should dr. whooves have deprived applejack of an opportunity to learn.....oh yeah...she didnt learn anything
nvm
accept for the last one
GO BIG MAC! WOOO!
Placebo: it's to keep sweat from his eyes
derpy was the acception
How are you?
yeah =P
derpy stole the show
i'm good
the cavalry have arrived!
8,1well, having me here gives you some new options and experience that you didn't have before, so i'll leave the rest of that for the tech meeting
this part made my heart melt a bit
no complaints
8,1anyhoos, my next point is two things, really
me too
exactly
:P
Cockiness is a definite flaw in Equestria.
srry checking my facebokk
Same
10,02Ohai Ingwaz :3
arrogant bastards
sisters :D
ohai der SuperBrony64
did I see Lyra jumping in the background?!
Flim and Flam agreed to them helping!! Nobody argue! lol
Why is it so expensive to run a farm? O_o Especially with a monopoly of Apples in Ponyville
proof that AJ learned her lesson in Applebuckign Season well.
Oh it is ON
yeah, sweet moment there
8,1first is another thing i'll go into at the tech meeting, but the other is more for here
braveheart!
Dermathil: eeyup
RAWRity: agreed
Indeed RAWRity.
10,02Everypony!
Lol! RAWRity
of course Fluttershy would help with the trees
uhh Cypresswolf....you obviously dont know about farming
noooo, the MLP laptops were a fake. . .
I agree
i love how she ummm 'bucks' the apples
surprised they didn't make a pinkie sense reference
No I dont.
your not sleeping!
go power ponies
8,1with BS2.0, i think it will make a lot of sense for us to move away from 000webhost
farming is not cheap, nor is it easy, a crop can easily go bad then you're low on money
Go fluttershy
is it wrong to masturbate to pony porn
Aww
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHiRC_sNX4w has worked so far, not to see if the upload works
yes
dat RD innuenedo...
Ultimate Organizer In the house. Field. Orchard.
fluttertree
epic
among many many other things
sometimes
all that shaking
i dont though
Any web hosts in mind?
fluttershy is the tree whisperer
yes!
8,1there are a number of reasons for this, including security, featureset, and our new requirements
im surprised she can buck so many apples in 1 hour
Lovely! :D
maybe it is maybe it isn't
they need scootaloo on that treadmill
i do
"Lovely. Horrid! Horrid! Lovely."
So much teamwork!
Someone's gonna make this in part of rhythm ponies series.
Brace yourselves... Moar bigmacxRD shipping.
Nah
ALL of Canterlot, huh? http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/120667?search=Luna
and Twi handles teh assembly
She would be too "Chicken"
So, if more of the apple family had been around, there'd be no contest.
just ask the tree to drop the apples
but im still a kid
BADUMYSH
8,1but one of the biggest thigns is that i think we should have way more control over our site than we curretnly do
inb4 they make a Rythm Heaven parody with "lovely! Horrid!"
the power has been DOUBLED!
And inventory.
And here's where the Bros screw up.
She would be like a penguin
Unicorn lazers are now canon
I expected the machine to explode.
Stop stealing fluttershy!
8,1especially considering that we stream copyrighted material
and here is where things go wrong
surprised applejack wasnt pissed they were ripping her trees out
The Moral: Don't Half-Ass it.
ikr
chickens can't run very fast
Ingwaz she's kinda occupied
thats about disqusting
Pwned
8,1a solution i'm suggesting is moving to EC2 on Amazon Web sErvices
lol
Ingwaz: they agreed to it
Same, Kira_Pony_Yamato
big mac lol
mac
Exactly
they haxed
poor Mac!
they didnt agree to have their trees destroyed
big mac physics
Randomnerd: AJ: Ah di'nt learn anythin'!
get off the dmn screen
I expected the machine to fail...
HAX
Jetsons referece!
YOU GO GrannY!
8,1we could use their free teir for setting up our own vritual server
This is more for the tech meeting though.
they agreed to let them use the apples from the south field
double time
RaveBrony: me too
RUN
wow, Nittany_Discord's Valve/Activision parallel really works...
07,01yea.
jetsons reference?
8,1yeah, i won't go into the guts of it here
not uproot the trees which would severely damage their livelihood
i was in the pinkie pie chat the other day
8,1but this is part of a wider point
CHAOTIC
lolololol
WingedCurse: when RD gets off the track and Big Mac goes spinning around the treadmill
thats one big pyramid of cider barrels
11,01It does.
they...
ohai #Bronystate
When Big Mac slipped and was spinning around on the treadmill
Hi Everypony!
is she getting humped?
oooohh, i see
lost :(
8,1to do something like this (which is somethign that would benefit us greatly) we may need a small amount of money to keep it going
hai IshBestPony
eeyup
hiya IshBestPony
8,1i'm talking $2 - $5 a month
yeah
you can practically hear him shouting "AJ! Stop this crazy thing!"
Very nice HeavyMetalDash!
Hey HeavyMetalDash
nice drawing HeavyMetalDash
too bad their Cider is crap
07,01poor AJ :(
theirs tastes like SHIT
y stack them like that y not in a 4 sided pyramid? harder to count i guess
And hi IshBestPony!
I now expected the town to turn on them!!!
this part made me so sad
I was then disappointed...
i'd rather drink shit
/me hugs Jim and otakon and LadyCanary
they do have style but somebody needs to shank these jerks
8,1even inside free tier, because it's based on what you use, we might go slightly over
/me hugs Luna "Hello Dear!"
how fancy
Their Cider is BEYOND crap, it's a health hazard.
8,1it may even be under $1 a month
07,01ohai
indeed
OH GOD
wow, BTTF, jetsons, AND john henery references in one episode
dat laugh
Dexter laugh
were those hemp leaves in the background of their banner?!
how is big mackintosh an apple name BTW? am i that stupid?
Randomnerd: drek
why would she have signed up for that
lol
D:
Luna woona :3
mandark*
a Macintosh is a type of apple
11,01Who pays? Us? Donations?
it was appleblooms fault
8,1but still, i wanted to raise the issue of raising money for the site's operations
/me hugs everypony
1,3type of apple I think?
ok
just noticed how their cutiemarks fit together
:)
8,1i have a couple of ideas
but still
Evidently Yiddish exists in Equestria
Finally finished that after a couple hours...I luv this episode BTW
:'(
BTW, I LOVE the voice they give the pink BG pony here. It's so hilarious! XD
i kind of wished everypony had literally driven them out of town without even having to taste the cider
:'(
there was a BTTF refference?
ohai Luna ^_^
meh: I said that already
If you want t call it cider...
i must google it
kay
Ingwaz: me too
Luna!
Bon bon's NEW voice! xD
eww
:[ YOU CALL THAT VIDER?
8,11) donations. we could put up a donate button and let our users donate money if they wish. very easy to set up
IT TASTES LIKE DIRT!
I got a rock...
8,1bugger
bon bon XD
Tastes like sh*t
suddenly bits are dollars
Even Milhouse pony hated it.
8,12 secs
you can see the bits of wood in it!
11,01Bon Bon's a VA.
8,1arhg
Ingwaz: That's the trouble with consumerism...
/me is blind
and they have CENTS
Lawl
8,1 1) donations. we could put up a donate button and let our users donate money if they wish. very easy to set up
Tom is in Bon Bon's cider
11,01She's a pony of a million voices.
suddenly, bits
I CAN SEE INTO THE FUTURE
NO!
like I said, Bon Bon is a Voice Actor in Equestria, thus why she has so many voices.
10,02Team rocket is blasting off again!
only rd would eat it then if its dirt :P
1 bit for the good barrels?
Lol "I cant get this taste off my tounge"
Next town, Apploooza :P
she's a VA for My Little Human
07,01that's a problem
aaww i was gonna say that
Nittany_Discord: that actualy makes alot of sense
Goddamit my melee is derping
awesome
07,01due to the content
get out of here!
We could take donations on the new domain
nah Nittany_Discord, i bet most of them were willing to drive them off
w0w the only think that came up was computers!
I've come to talk to you again
lol
Since we'd be legit then
Someone help me find a "Deal or no Deal" Clip
anypony know what next week's movies are?
If Unicorns can use their magic to make machine-powering lasers, could they use their magic for weaponized lasers?
07,01^
:s
07,01that's an option
does anypony know what the preshow videos were this morning? Specifically the one with Pinkie Pie, the band and twilight in the background?
8,1 2) t-shirts and other merch. this is a popular idea, and i know our users would buy BS merch
"this video is currently being processed"
hi NullRadix
:D
HELL YEAH!
yup
just when he say's "Deal or no deal"

G3 ponies D:
That was the best B movie ever.
8,1but with the profits going to BS
if you see a guy called 'Amazon' can you give him that link?
Randomnerd: true, but the final product was CRAP
#Vinyl_Scratch
NO G3!
KILL IT WITH FIRE
11,01It was.
processing == uploading
1,3The McIntosh Red (or McIntosh; colloquially, the Mac) is an apple cultivar with red and green skin, a tart flavor, and tender white flesh.
8,1i know DCD currently does commissions too
Randomnerd: you can win in speed but if you dont have quality, nobody will want your product
BURN!
But they screwed themselves because it was undrinkable
TY kirzstrfe
8,1maybe step that up a notch
wow
i like them a bit
IshBestPony: look up rod from god and consider what a unicorn with powerful telekinesis can do
heh
and technically, they lost, they didnt make cider, that cant count as cider
no not into the pit IT BURNS
Hmm apparently the Flim Flam brothers song is based on "Ya Got Trouble" from The Music Man.
GTFO
xD
"totally unrainbow"
assuming I remember, sure
I cant stay for the post show this time, Ill see yall next week
/me rolleyes
8,1i guess my point here is that money shouldn't be an issue for moving to EC"
they said their cider was top quality, that stuff was junk
N ot really. They failed at making cider. The barrlels were at the end full of... Um... well, you ask Pinkie Pie. She knows all about that.
Can someone tell me how to enter the lotto so I can enter next week??????
So if I challenge Starbucks to a coffee-off I can run them out of business?
sup guys first time!
8,1*EC2
...Thats awesome Ouroboros!
10,02Please don't post anything in #Vinyl_Scratch until I say the word. Remember to follow the rules with requests and nothing longer tahn 10 min.
I know that, I was explaining for RawketLawnchair
awesome
another ep..?
Well
oh, i didnt see that part
this is exciting.
u dare bring light into my lair?!
:'( u hurt my feelings
U MUST DAI!
10,02Go!
SuperBrony64, do you know what video this morning was that had pinkie pie in front of a band eating stuff?
1,3SB is setting up for requests
Odds are I'll get distracted parsing this code, forget about it, and come across the notepad doc when I'm shutting down my computer this evening
I'm scared by the guy on the left
8,1also, 3) the dreaded ads. we could put some up, and i'm sure we could generate some income for the site from them, but do we want to?
daniel ingram is win
6_9
owait sorry. Forgot not everybody has of those apples being cultivated a few dozen kilometers away.
They should have won, because the Apples cheated.
:(
Kencolt: good point, it's pretty failtastic at the end.
04Well, merchandise shouldn't be a problem yeah
with twilight making funny faces in the background?
That, and they cannot unto quality control.
peckish pony 2 pony_4270
haha
04Commissions, clothing, music, etc.
8,1personally, i like 2 the best
yeah, happens to me too
10,02^
pinkie is staring at me
I'm not sure about ads.
so ur scared of urself?
kk thx
lol
1,3:p Dermathil
Ingwaz: that was because Wood got into the cider. during the song the cider was great.
Because ad revenue would probably be pretty meh.
twilight is best trumpet player
so why ecactly couldnt we watch epic movie?
10,02But then again what video DOESN'T have Pinkie Pie eating stuff :D
?
this IS better than kongregate
07,01on the new domain it would be interesting
:P
I guess it depends on how intrusive the look.
that it?
lol
well, I dunno
8,1well, we do get at least 5000 imperessions a week
so what happens after the episode ends?
1,3bed reception of it during last night's showing
04^On top of that, I'd like to draw the least amount of attention to us with corporations and IPs
I would have liked it had Grannie tricked them using underripe apples.
that awkward moment when it isn't awkward
that's all they got?
07,01^
11,01Yeah.
ok
8,1aye
And that's where the ads would be.
SuperBrony64: well, i can think of ONE.
11,01Last thing we need is a cease and decist.
nah, that would be cheating
But the machine can probably detect ripeness, as well as rot.
apparently
04Exactly
Because pony eps would still be on the old domain.
an*
11,01Or worse.
he's loading up the next one/movie
ah
movie?
04Don't say worse
well, because most people had already seen it before and as such they could see the jokes coming
yeah
Mobie?
oh
they show movies on here.
/me panics
*Movie
They made the mistake of shutting down the Quality Control mechanism...
like real cinema movies?!
(I didn't and as such found it hillarious)
8,1okay, well, it's something to think about
07,01okay anything else?
Mhmm
what game/show says that's it thats all they got?
8,1 2 secs
07,01ok
are you sure she didn't RAWRity?
thats some cool shit
they showed Alice in wonderland and Epic movie
like Epic Movie last night
it is mostly using shock jokes that only work once.
yeah
8,1oh, yes, roles of techies
Woah! Icant believe I didnt notice Derpy during the Flim Flam song O.o
funny shit
what are we gonna watch next :D ?
8,1but i think we already covered that
NO EPIC MOVIE
xD
no pls
the postshow.
lol i could watch that XD
8,1only ops are allowed to stream, yes?
ALICE IN WONDERLAND?!?!?!?
1,3it's really a 1-time movie, seeing it more doesn't do anything for the movie
oh
So, if the brother hadn't gotten overconfident and allowed outside help, the would have won.
it's better when you're in chat room
aka people requests
lawl
they would have won if the others wouldn't have helped
there we go
And I missed it D:???
YES
Ops and designated streamers
yep
twice.
Mhm
that's what I said kirz
8,1aye
Indeed, Tovler
yay Pendulum
so, everypony help me out here, can you send someone a message on facebook if you are not listed as their friend?
Tovler: eeyup
.
8,1also, can me and shizu get access to the live site?
10,02lol sorry, none of that heavy metal music
aw
Discord would have won had he just eaten the Mane 6
Ingwaz: enope sorry
cool
ON TO THE YOUTUBE FANFICS
8,1i.e. the 000 account
hmm
...Mastodon. I think.
not that I know of
boooo
Evil is arrogant
SuperBrony64: it's not...it's DnB.
XD
/me was headbobbing
Or I'll get distracted reading FO:E-PH (if it updates tonight... which it seems to semi-consistantly)
1,3yes, but I said it in GLORIOUS Technicolor :3
hmm, are you sure? it has the option to send a message
lol
*headbangs*
8,1anyhoos
8,1moving on
dis music
with ozzy xD
RAWRity's request got thrown in the pooper
8,1n
That's why 'The Last Roundup" floored so many ponies. We're so used to trying to find Derpy in the most unlikely places that when she was shoved in our faces like that , well...
8,1
8,1
I was actually ashamed to see that the Apple Family didnt welcome technology :\
8,1
ummmm
1,3<3
8,1whoops
well not really
8,1connection derp
but i'm guessing that you cant as i have begun my "pony assualt" on my brother in an attempt to convert im, yet he has not responded
SuperBrony64 :(
well im going now seeya and brohoof
Technicolor seems to be compensating for something else if you ask me.
Wouldve added a new element to the farm :P
07,01@ RaveBrony technology can be bad to old traditions
this is so hardcore *licks lips*
1,3:p
i saw this same video with a different song yesterday
^^
True^
8,1next and final point isn't really about tech
by pony
So... huh... I guess I should have turned my brain off during the episode.
Well, the flim-flam brothers offered an unfair deal
Trololo
see ya unnamed pon
just like john henry...
yy
Tovler: no, why?
im gonna listen to my own music i will still be on chat
8,1i noticed that in the rules, our classification of a B movie is... misleading
unfair is not even an appropriate description
1,3I've been staring at text walls for the past 10 hours, I'm bored :p
I are back everypony
They probably would have gone for a fair deal. That deal was far from fair.
25% for the apple family?
8,1i don't like the wording "generally bad"
yeah
75% of the profits is hardly acceptable.
they supply the apples
the fact that this clip is in it makes it 20% cooler
it should have been 50 50
8,1it makes people think we want to watch terrible movies, like Epic Movie
they were offered to just buy the machine first were they not?
same :P
And the vast majority of the work.
We do
60% would have been fair imo, the machine requires no work from them
:D
Even Filthy Rich probably gives better prices to his suppliers.
8,1when there are tons and tons of great low budget movies and cult classics out there
kirz, I've been coming to bronystate consistently everyday since mid-may and never winning the lottery. You ain't got nothing on me, and you know it.
it's ponies, it doesn't need to be 20% cooler xD
/me bangs his head
60% for the apple family i mean
:l
13well, it takes a certain level of bad, like plan 9
Is the stream muted? (or is it jsut me?)
true
welcome to the world of business
daww
Ouroboros: just you I think
8,1as i said in the chat ealier, "so bad it's good" is cool
omg its picking up!
1,3hehe
its just you Ouroboros
He must-- he's respected.
indeed
Battlefield Leverage bad is beautiful
8,1but "so bad it's horrible" is bleh
/me won once >.>
Thanks.
zackoroth: no, they were offered a partnership where they would provide the apples and sell the cider, and would get only 25% of profits.
exactly.
zackoroth: they weren't going to sell the machine, it's easier for them to offer it
8,1i think we should change the wording there
You know....thinking about the episode again... it wudve been nice for the Apples to be a match for the machine
11,01We should post that XKCD comic on the rules page.
wat did you pick wen you won?
If they sold it, they'd have to build more.
how did she not see that coming?
I still come back even though my karma is the bitchiest on the goshdarn planet.
and then Flim and Flam try to sabbotage the Apples stuff O.o
1,3Glomp pile!
8,1well, yes, but i think we should just be a bit clearer that we don't want to torture ourselves
idk O_O
she didn't need to
D:
/me pulls everypony into a glomp pile on Dermathil
Well it wasn't torture for me
8,1that's not the point of watchign a B movie
inb4 spark
RaveBrony: they were more than a match for it, the flim flam brothers had to cut their quality to crap to try and win
=D
she is PHSYCIC
still have to finish foe
/me 11,01is pulled
what did she think was gonna happen? they were going to colide and cat fight?
:d
It was hilarious watching the chat and the film
what would have made sense is if they offered a flat fee to use it
:)
honorary family members are still family members
:(
8,1oh, also, i don't think we have anything about WMC in the rules
:[
13well.. epic movie is also the first one since... sepember, babes in toyland
1,3mallrats for the b movie
part way through foe-ph but i'm going to wait for it to finish
lol that wouldve been epic
8,1and we should put it in
/me glomps glompile
13to get wmc
I guess they'll go to one of the Apple Family's other farms and buy those out.
/me stands tall and carries the whole of bronystate chat on his shoulders.
well, i gotta go, Goodnight everyone!:)
/me the gravitational pull of the glomp pile drags IshBestPony in
/me is pulled in
/me is smothered in glomps from glomp pile
>:O
chats so busy
:O
NeverEatingCupcakesA what are you listening to?
I vaguely remember itÃ©
8,1anyhoos, that's more or less all i wanted to say
Bye, TheGreatAndPowerfulT
>:D
Well, Goodnight everyone! See ya later~ :)
g'night tGaPT
3I've always seen B movies as low budget/low rating/cult film
DEM EYES
gnight TheGreatAndPowerfulT
good night TheGreatAndPowerfulT
i have no idea what im listening to
DAT FLANK
/me begins running from teh gravitational glomp pull
lol
8,1aye, same here
OPEN
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAH
this is AWESOME!
1,3notes and chords
xD
shes not gonna make it captain!
Ingwaz, Im saying like Before the other joined in to help :o and maybe the others see Flim and Flam trying to sabbotage stuff? idk
the end
/me puts hoof against the glomp pile affectionately
^_^
ah *facehoof*
8,1my example earlier was that El Mariachi is a B, but is also considered one of the greatest movies of all time
creepy spacedude
Whatever, episode is made, nothing i can do xD
dat thumbnail
im listening to party with Pinkie (Living tombstone remix)
:D
well i must go, got a dnd game and a pc to repair
btw kirz, you just allowed me to say that I'm carrying all of bronystate chat on my shoulders. thanks!
not a blank music video...
kool
later #BronyState
Have fun, Phase4
omfg
damn
1,3:)
bye Phase4
have fun Phase4
bye Phase4
Take care Phase4
see ya phase
bai Phase4
later #BronyStateRegulars
ohey my first request :3
minecraft?
Ooh... Tomorrow is 40K Day :D
13for me it's the ones weren't good enough for A, like Hackers or The Core
this beter be ponies
40k day?
well RaveBrony, its an unfair set up, having a machine thats completely automated and capable of gathering, sorting, and producing cider in a very short time against 4 ponies, 1 a child and 1 an elderly mare
it had better
/me desperately scrambles away but is slowly dragged towards the glomptum singularity
whats that?
if it isnt
thats hardly fair at all
Just... keep staying off my lawn when I don't invite you on it, alright?
oh okay.
:l
it dousnt deserve bronystate
I'm playing my brother in a game of Warhammer 40K
flutterremix
YES
/me waves his walking stick.
/me still at bottom of glomp pile
:|
8,1and... Manos: Hans of Fate
YES!
ah
-_-
this is pretty good
Ah I see.
Warhammer 40k is so expensive
OMG it's fluttershy remix
Dashie, I'm at bottom. I'm carrying all the clomps.
/me passes out
i could D'aww to this.
07,01Zzzz
8,1aye, all i'm saying is we change the wording slightly
04Evil Dead II is loved by millions, but it's most certainly a B film
XD
I understand, Ingwaz. Im just thinking about it too much thats all xD I get what i get and i shudnt mind a bit, right? :P
/me throws a frisbee on Dermathil's lawn
I use fancy words I do
no
sorry Luna
must
*insta-sleep*
if she was actually singing it
resist
sleep!
/me glomps Fleur
For example most people loved Blazing Saddles, where as I found it boring.
inb4 bass drops :D
I'm next to you ;)
I've been building an army for 8 years or so.
/me grabs it and throws it back.
/me naps
NeverEatingCupcakesA Y U NO eat cupcakes ever again?
/me can't escape glompile despite years of moshpit training
im new here so how do you make the chat like an action
/me hands otakon coffee
And Blazing Saddles is one of those 'amazing films' you're probably talking about
See? No need to walk on my lawn.
11,01Buying all of those ships and troops for WH40K is expensive.
thanks Jim
that must be a huge army
07,01try /me txt
1,3./me
hoofprints are bad for its proper growth.
Nope.
whats everybodys fav pony?
I ran tyranids for 40K
man...i wish there were show accurate toys...
/me txt
/me chugs coffee......"HOT!"
So you get all kind of movies out of it
04Well that's the magic of film, everybody has a different perspective on it so not everybody is going to consider A movie to be A and B movie to be B
8,1but i think we need to make the intention B movies clearer
spike
:o
It's 1500 points. We played small armies for a while
Ingwaz: you and everyone else
lol
fillyfillyy watch the fanfic "Cupcakes" and you'll know why
/me facehoofs otakon
one figurine is $45
And thats why you dont chug HOT COFFEE otakon
Ditzy Doo
Thanks!
All ponies are best pony
04We try to
But the intention is different to different people.
ditzy???
oh, you were talking about the coffee
13blazing saddles was also supposed to be B
i know i loved that one
lol
fail
my cousins play it
i figured id do it for you, since you seem to be in need of a good facehoo
/me derps
shes awesome
hoof*
To you it's only so bad it's good
:O:D
8,1my specific objection is the wording "generally considered bad"
how dare you call her ditzy doo
derpy -.-
04There's more then just "generally bad" for B film descrition
second is pinkie :D
muahahahaha
For me it's also just HORRIBLE films too.
04*description
Nittany, I prefer just holding my collector 3rd edition Space Hulk board game.
:3
how DARE YOU:[
bufff I LICFF hotff coffeeee
come ooonnn
if there were actual show accurate toys, they'd sell a lot better
OneTrickPony: See, I don't play special characters... I spend $40 for squads of old minis
thats her real name
no it isn't
oh
my freind did a really good reading of itt
04We tried to set objective reasons for why a B film is B
but if u want derpy its derpy :3
but the fanfic was definittley not nightmare material
phffftttaafffttfftt
Ingwaz: return of the mcdonald ponies
04Such as budget cost
they're coming back
rainbow called her derpy
and they're gonna be awesome again.
I play an IG army... they get you with TANKS.
indeed Dermathil, and i will be buying several of each one each week
aww yeah I get mine free!!!
yeah forgot
it was a name of a random backround pony, so she just filled derpys body for it that episode
Call upon the McPonies when you're in distress
13amendment to clarifying the A/B distinction (as i understand it, AGAIN), should probably make the six month encore and four week ineligible vote rules clearer/more visible
i'm sorry, but admins, we need to show this guy the derpy-sode
I used to play Warhammer 40k, but then I took an imperial army to the Tyranids
her official name is derpy now that she's canon
i'm also monitoring local walmarts to see when they might get new blindbags in
lol OneTrickPony
/me gets made ino a cupcake
good
rainbow factory and rocket to insanity MUAHAHA more
i wouldn't mind the derpy-sode myself
true
sounds good
i checked the one that had some last night, seems theyve been sold or removed
... or... my computer will freeze forcing a restart, killing previously noted notepad document and the other document I was parsing this program flow into...
i vote derpy-sode
1,3it's still considered not very pony, and not a topic for bronystate :p
Everypony, I need halp.
too bad he doens't watch chat
as do i
I was also terrible at the game
true...
yeah. the rules forbid discussion of it
what's up Dashie_Dashie?
I need to find a sound clip for "Deal or no Deal"
or at least the normal chat
oh
Dashie_Dashie wut is the problem?
just like... *shivers* spiderseses.
of those fanfics?
>.>
where he just ask's the simple "Deal or no deal"
:( k
8,1aye
oh
they watch for spam
the spam vultures
Yeah, but taht isn't the streamer
uhm..Tried youtube?
so they know what we are saying
youtube is dry
Are we allowed to post videos that are not on CorporateTube?
04We could probably put it on our site somewhere
so no talking of those fanfics then
04Or in our rules
1,3ugh, I've had Vi quoting spiderseses over skype for the last few days >.<
hmm, I don't know then
try soundcloud
Ummm idk?
hahaha kirz
.
mod, plz contact the streamer
poor thing you.
sorry Kira
youtube gives me 10 minute vids
this is an epic song
Are we?
I just need a 3 second clip @_@
This music.
so far i only have 3 wave 1 blind bag ponies, none of them the mane 6
you could go on youtube and use an onlie video downloader todownlod it as sound format
What is this music?
13i think the four week thing is in the rules, but it's buried in that paragraph
i have never heard of spiderseses, and i will never want to.
Dashie_Dashie: take the video and extract teh sound clip from it
I have a calender, lol
11,01I assume that the 4-week exclusion category would be for one slot of the lottery.
13but i'll bring that up more in the techie meeting when i talk content specifics for BS2.0
04If it is, we should make it its own paragraph
I must know this music.
now im listening to party with pinkie non remixed
it's a fluttersy remix
0,14QUick suggestion, sorry to interrupt, but maybe techies could put up something in the backlog to indicate whether or not somehting is eligble to be re-picked when BS2.0 launcheds?
eh, i'm bored
use a youtube downloader, than convert the file into an mp3 or something
1,3but yeah, if you haven't had a chance yet, our rules are at www.bronystate.net/rules
*fluttershy
or maybe i'm just noob and there is somewhere where we request...like...vinyl scratch room
Pinkie Pie Swear: Hush Now Quite Now (Lucid Dream Mix) RawketLawnchair
^^
yeah
04They do
13SaxyPretender: http://du.cx/shizuka/?page_id=96 done
i got used to it and forgot it exists
Ah.
8,1SaxyPretender: shizu's already done that
ive read them
And your welcome
04They have that for the list
wait no
I like it.
pinkie pie
04What Shizu just put up
Thank you, broski.
lol
You gotta request in the bronystate room
then use a audio program to cut the sound out
0,14K, gotcha.
NP
:0
Also, is VioletVanilla doing her Radio show?
I assume that's a no...
Yes
This week she is
:O*
Dang...
confused myself because I have fluttershy remix on a tab
what is this spiderseses thingy though?
04Next?
:s

finally.
real bad fic.
Looking at that list.
:p
brb, gonna check out our parallel channel
dont wanna hear it.
ok
So many memories.
Ahahaha.
Ah, neat.
04I know right

Well, I ought to go get myself some dinner.

So I'll see you all in a bit.

TACTICAL MUTE INBOUND
This is like the only PMV that I actually like :3
Is C just for the worst films?
NICE
04Alright, so, what's next in the meeting?
its synced!
04And yeah, C is for WMC material
is those 2 fanfics under the innapropriate for caht catagory?
very well
there's lots liek that
are you a new brony or something
Spider's Web didn't get WMCed.
:>

who?
no
07,01PROJECTS & PARTNERSHIPS:
07,01- team input (Do you have any possible partners for us in mind? if so which and why? how can we contact them?
04That's because some people found it enjoyable
im new to the chat
meh
07,01this one is short
epic mlp music video is epic
07,01we're almost done btw
these are all on youtube
i know
are you two like the only ones here?
Indeed it is
>.>
you can spend hours watching this
I know an amv with this exact song that I prefer way more... but it isn't pony.
PMVs aren't so great, the more I think about 'em. Shoehorning in footage to music rarely ends well.
there's more, they're just asleep from that last song
yeah :D
kinda
trixie ^.^
/me comes back from new ep and notices that someone pinged her. Is Wrek awake!? :D
THis ends well.
ok
fail
trixie is cool
So, Twilight is the messiah...I knew it
scroll down a lil bit?
/me glares at AMVs for all possible Pairings...
:$
Not that I can see Fleur. And twas not I who pinged you
I think he might be Fleur...
11,01Artists maybe?
:#
/me glomps Fleur
i hate this song -.-
idk though
0,5Oh I know! EQD!
dat IshBestPony
this song is annoying
I take it EqD is out of the question...
I like it
Only tolerable because of ponies
07,01hah..
Wrek isn't awake yet I think
lol
yup
0,5;3
mute ftw
it's not so much out of the question
and hippies
and thats not saying much
But that's just my opinion
so much as every time we TRY to be nice to them, they give us the middle finger
/me scrolled up and noticed that it was just IshBestPony glomping me while I wasnt here
10,02^
11,01In what way?
Pegusus sideways tornado
obviously
:c the rainbow_dash chat doesn't appreciate this pmv
d'aaw Filly Twi
example:
coolest thing ever
lol
0,5What about animators like MrPoniator who actually come to Bronystate? Thats cool
04They screw us over in our email
is it playing dif vid yet?
05,15Well actually on the EqD note, I feel like we should try and get our own post back. Find out what the deal between us is.
04They lump us in with every other pony stream
1,3a general rule of thumb is if it would run contrary to the spirit of MLP, or it's something they wouldn't put into an episode of Family Guy, then it's probably not chat appropriate
you know how (what is it, Bronychat?) that radio thing gets adverts on eqd?
no
dat angle
10,02By grouping us with other streams and classifying outselves as a 'Marathon'
xD
shit
04Yep
0,5You know, MrPoniator? The guy who makes the cool animations?
Get ready for amazing stuff...
we ASKED them how we could get on that site
i like that effect
calm down the song aint that bad
and he basically said we were a one-trick pony
OBJECTION
8,1can i just ask, why are we trying to get away from EqD?
love and tolerate
i'm not upset to begin with -.-
so many rainbooms
8,1wouldn't it be beneficial to work with them?
dont hate!
great video editing
and then a month or so later, OH LOOK, there's a radio thing advertising on EqD
8,1they're pretty massive
ok wait should i not read spiderseses though
love and tolerate people, not terrible music xD
04BECAUSE WE'RE REBELLIOUS! *runs away crying and slams the door*
exactly lolwut
lol
no, no, no this song sucks
I need to go favourite this video, brb every pony
i was just sayin
guys
1,3it's written extremely poorly, and I mean extremely poorly
04We're like the rookie to their pro
/me cuddles up next to Fleur
04Or some shit
and i was just typin.
04Basically, we shouldn't be EqD
04We need to be US
can i make a suggestion?
also, spidertwilight.
Because we don't want to be reliant on them.
worse than Im nut ok i promiss
10,02We like Rainbow Dash, they like Trixie, we just can't coexist.
dat correction
It could be a lot worse (most of today's music, specifically rap and hip-hop, for example)
it is frightening.
3Remember MrEvergreen and co.'s game that me, SB, and LC are now taking part in? We could partner up with them to help create a game under the BronyState name. Just a thought.
Because they let us down
this is epic with http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yo__1A-XR0c&feature=related
consistantly.
0,5So no one on board for animators like MrPoniator?
This is some AWESOME editING. Makes me even more proud of this fandom.
Twilight and spiderbabies.
oh, speaking of partnerships
around the 3 minutes mark
...
^
10,02SlurryMoon: I was actually going to mention about that at the end of the meeting
whatever happened to the Fighting is Magic people?
04Was about to say, LC, can you show us some of his work?
8,1i'm not saying be reliant on them, i'm saying let them help us and let us help the
/me nods
8,1*them
they mentioned having us stream shit for them, but then they disappeared
aww that synced perfectly
3Okay then SB
05,15Val maybe you should talk about your flash game idea, get that made and posted around.
04We've TRIED to get them to help us
0,5Oh god yes, his animations are cool
And that's why I request it every time I can.
04But they don't
how about...Pinkies Lie!
BIDE
0,5Ill link you in a sec Ghosties
xD
04Alright
is it worse than im nut ok i promiss
by woodentoaster!
after the meeting, I'll talk about it in SRS
yes it is way worse.
In #vinyl_scratch
There's always fan-fiction writers and musicians..
since I don't think people want to chat about it here
8,1i can see there's anymosity between us and them, but maybe we should look into getting past that and getting something good going
^
so just be on the lookout for that
d'aww at fluttershys
the one princess too rule them all
ok den
8,1i mean, we're all bronies, right?
04NO
fluttershy has a goatee
04Well maybe
xD
04I dunno
1,3"It was a beutiful spring daty in equestrias when tilight sparkle was in her study where she lived."

Ty's definition of brony is different to yous.

04Yep
WAT
04I'm the anti-brony
0,5Ghosties, MrPoniator is the guy who makes the short animations of ponies. You may have seen some of them. http://www.youtube.com/user/MrPoniator
wtf?
lol
11,01Could we get artists on board somehow?
why does she have facial hair
dead stream and chat?
07,01^
lolwut?
04And we already have some artists on board
nah, just quiet
guess so
Hm.
Twilight used spell 25 on her

8,1i'm the publicity officer of my university's music society. we have a similar situation with the university's music centre.

10,02If you don't want to buy a Louis Vuitton after this, you are crazy O___O
Hehe.

Seth used to give us our own post.
Who requested this amazing trippy video.
10,02From their perspective, they see us just as a 'streaming site' and as such don't deserve our own post anymore.
I don't know, I really liked it
alice in wonderland on japanese drugs?
I must know.
:(
But then once his lackeys started doing our posts

ORBITAL FRIENDSHIP CANNON!
time travel!
11,01I don't really know any major brony artists, but I could run around and ask them things regarding BronyState anyway.
the heck?
oh
0,14Brief side note thing, (and I can wait till general) but I noticed on the forums and just now about contacting the Fighting is Magic, what was the idea behind that? I have something forumlating in my mind...
04Is MrPoniator a BronyState reg?
1897 and everything is orange
.....
.\
at least he was nice enough to make us appear first
14, eh?
11,01I don't know them personally.

Stoned to hell
nope, not strange at all
i thought he was small!
dat lag
dafuq
...
Why do I LOVE IT so much.
13mrponiator is around sometimes, was just last night i think, but not quite as often as the rest of the regs, probably just due to life
04Eh, if you think he'd like to help I don't see why not giving him a shout
lag?
lag
wth IS THIS!?
laggy
catchy music?
is it frozen for you guys?
hey
Celestia, save me!
nvm,
a bit
that chest was full of freindship!
sudden freeze frame...
not really
>mfw I recognize Vissia's name in here
Raritycatchme!
I agree with otakon, what is this
Kencolt: what IS THIS? I don't even
There's a prequel to this, but it's over 5 minutes long.
...mfw I actually know the artist of this video.
Remeber kids, drugs are bad, you'll end up like the person in the video
i said nvm -.-
10,02That sums up how my mind feels right now.
what the
Takashi Murakami.
om nom nom
SaxyPretender: We had contact with the team making Fighing is Magic a while back
this isnt ponys!
.....
I'm still not entirely sure what's going on.
^SB64 XD
really?
the crap is this?
SuperBrony64: agreed, let us never speak of that again
no this is totally ponies
alright
japanese ponies?
Were working out streaming previews of the game for them, and streaming a tournement when it first came out
04Speaking of Fighting is Magic, we had ideas and stuff
11,01I wish FimFlamFilosopher would answer me back. We had a bit of a conversation going months back, but he stopped answering my Youtube PMS.
And that's how luggage is made.
French?
8,1well, if we could get some big brony names on board and featured on BS2.0, then i think we've got a pretty good chance of gaining a foothold
must have taken 10 hours to get the shading on the eyes right
Takashi Murakami, YOU ARE AMAZING
11,01*PMs
I agree with Ingwaz, what is this
But then they just went and streamed a preview on their owns.
(Scout)That did NOT just happen!
that's probably derpys dreams
^
XD
So that kind of put that to rest.
04And they never got back in touch with us
this
lol
yay
.....
sweet
that's better
oh hell yah!
04So either they forgot about us or I dunno
hmm....this could be win
Ponie
my video :)
1,3has anyone ever contacted derpyhooves.com about mentioning the stream? I know they compete with EqD
hello?
it IS!
pony*
pony -.-
Sounds like Mega Man.
Hey sorry
0,14Damn, I was thinking of getting in contact with us so we could host a premiere tournament.
Mlp: Turn based combat is magic
THIS IS WIN!
it does a bit Randomnerd
...Oh baby.
too bad it's not a PMV
np
okay
sounds like megaman but ain't got shit on the 2nd and 3rd's osts.
04I mean
stop staring at me!
I'll be back
04If you want you can still try
niiice
dinner is ready
How are you?
shes freaking me out
pony should pony pony :P
well, there's no harm in trying again
04I don't exactly see the problem in it
Takashi Murakami was inspiration for Summer Wars movie.
Dermathil: i dont think anything can compete with classic mega man music
just remember they've already ditched us before
07,01just keep us involved :)
07,01okay shall I move on?
Tovler: I could totally see the similarities.
I talked to navybrony a couple of days ago, and he we're actually cool with each other! Maybe I can get him involved
that stuff is orgasmic
and do go on.
^^
yup
so applejack's number came up?
i can't hear the theme
Hm, never heard of derpyhooves.com before

07,01COMMUNICATION & FILESHARING:
07,01- make sure you inform everyone who needs to know about everything, even if you think someone else already has. It's better to be told twice than not at all.
07,01- As for filesharing, all movies and eps should be uploaded to dropbox in a timely manner, and images/audio/visual for projects should be brought to everyone involved in the project as soon as completed. And by timely manner I mean NOT on Thursday night.
lllaaaaggggg
07,01- make sure to record all BANS!
07,01- Who wants to sign up to help us retrieve the movie selection?
07,01-We want a rotation of certain ponies every week who are responsible for getting the files and putting them in the BMN folder.

Anyone seen the Discord and Celestia version of this song?

I dont think ive mentioned that I have a side job before
Hunch Back of Notre Dame is a great film
zecora bakura
dermathil, i am male as well, facial hair is nothing new to me
06As far as partnerships go, und any sort of contact, something I have learned from several other sites. Constantly email. The only way we get interviews is to show we are serious, the only way we show we are serious is by being curteous und straightforward. Its how all of the major sites are in contact with writers/producers/etc. of FiM. They find ways to contact them. Same way with getting
hunchback for A movie?
6our name out there und getting others to know us. The only way to know somepony ist to start a connection.
11,01I heard that some parents sent Hasbro letters criticizing them over Derpy.
This vid is so epic
One of the most powerful and amazing Disney songs.
:o i would watch tha tmovie if we had it
Lion King for A movie
04ALL BOW TO VIOLETVANILLA! BRINGER OF FLOWERS AND WIELDER OF VANILLA
Wat
Nittany_Discord: really?
yeaht they said it was offensive
It's quite dark to be Disney, I like it
Vicky Cristina Barcelona for A movie. Tucker and Dale vs Evil for B.
lawl
Lion King is win
lol
I just realized this is from hunchback of notre dam...best villain song ever
they gave bon bon a new name any 1 notice that
/me hugs meh tightly. THANK YOU SO MUCH for picking that movie :D I wub it.

Again, I'm for the Discordand Celestia version of Hellfire.
3x3
11,01Well, I know of one person, but he hasn't answered me back.
Nittany_Discord: well, there was somebody on MLB who tried to say "Derpy" was an ableist slur against the mentally retarded, and that the show using that name made them ashamed of the fandom.
/me had shivers down my spine
May god have mercy on me...
Anyone have it / seen it?

We aren't entirely about ponies here. We're also about crazy, about happiness, about good music, and about movies that never existed.
ok
WingedCurse: no idea
WingedCurse: it's a high budget movie. A and B are not marks of quality one way or the other
Kencolt speaks the truth
hazard, he can't hear you
WingedCurse: marketed as an A movie, but B movie quality
my skyrim broke so i turned to renturning to being a brony so thats why im here lol
can u do Princess Molestia Is Exited?
XD Who is the troll who edited Lion King into the backlog?
it's just a post by mods that goes in all chats
10,02First, there is a project that is being done by MrEvergreen (you might have seen him frequent a number of IRC channels). Me, SlurryMoon, and LordCelestia are a part of that team in helping to design an RPG Pony game.
derpsalot: get new skyrim!
Lol?
titan A.E. :o
ah
1,3lol, I'm not a bot :p
oh well lolwut
I see
bai
It can be turned into a full time job if I got better at it
you know what would make an awesome A movie... Dark City
this song isn't that mad though
:P
oh =s
but I just do it as a hobby
i was done anyways
RAWRity, does that still mean that classic films like 12 Angry Men which are low budget would be counted as B movies?
YES IT IS
otakon: it wouldn't be fair to the mods who chose their movies. They weren't chosen by the lottery but it was a special event. So even then I'd see it as counting.
the bot speaks
Garden-of-Sound: technically, yes.
1,3unless I'm programmed to respond like that :3
oh wiat
oh, it'
http://www.ebay.com/itm/220943467729?ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1555.l2649
hello bronstate
ITS A CLEVER BOT
this is actually pretty good
Lawl
hai BlueDWarrior
haha
Some day. . .Grave of the Fireflies will get chosen.
bluestrom_S: *
CONVINCE IT
1,3<3 :D
I can show you some stuff I have listed
sorry kirs, mistook you for an actualy bot
xD
10,02He would like to form some sort of partnership with BronyState in hopes of gaining support with his game as well as raise awareness. In exchange, I believe we will have 'publishing' rights to it (need to confirm).
hey EspyLacopa
Let's watch Buckaroo Banzai again
bot will you be my friend <3
A) When in doubt, ask a mod
Morning Dermathil.
i forgot the name
A and B are not about quality, it's about budget and popularity.
B) Mod positions may change at any given time
1,3must be that soul I'm lacking >.>
nevermind
lol
04Who will have publishing rights to it?
:(
Luna just confirmed it
hey kirz
dramatic lag.
has the stuff for next week been decided yet?
you can haz my soul bot friend <3
DeadpoolDash:
I believe so
we can't see Lion King for at least 4 more months
yes
A classic example is... well, a lot of the B movies that far outsrtip the A.
Okay hold on
dat symbol
can u do Princess Molestia is excited?
o.o
10,02I want to say us as we'll be helping to support the game
/me noms Critchley's soul
damn, why so long though?
RAWRity, surely if a low budget film was incredibly popular and well known it would count as an A then?
O_O
k
Like Rocky Horror Picture Show.
11,01*Please let it be indie. Please let it be indie.*
04...us as in BronyState or us as in you guys?
We can see inception again two weeks from now :3
The Jerk foar B movie?
xD
3BronyState
Garden-of-Sound: then it's borderline and up for the mods to decide
^_^
eeyup
10,02^
what won?
04Ah, okay
just like you nommed the <> around your name xD
IshBestPony: I believe so
11,01Cool.
I sooooo want to see inception again
Titan A.E.
So what does he want from us in return
Is there gonna be a super 4 movie BMN for the one year of BMN BMN?
10,02SlurryMoon: Do you have a link to the project details?
no pumpkin no chewimg on peoples souls
and Revenge of the Nerds
1,3well first, requests are taken in the #Vinyl_Scratch channel
DeadpoolDash: Titan A.E. and Revengs of the Nerds
right
hmmm
alright thanks
yeah, toooooooooold you xD
11,01Do we get cameos?
3Let me look in my saved files

YES
THIS
interesting
didnt know this first time on chat ^_^

YES
ah nice
My vid :)
What?
04What will we get for publishing rights besides exclusivity? Cameos, etc.?
Second time on chat
Of course for those new to BronyState, you shouldn't worry too much, since last night we didn't have a B movie.
I wonder, I would love to put this one anime film that is a favorite of mine in the lottery.
lol
I have that game :p
xD
epic
nice remix :D
this is epic
SQUEE

LadyCanary: what is it?

i want to be a tree T.T
omg so epic
I've been voting for it as A for the last couple weeks
this ones pretty large..
We need fluttermetal replacing Squeels with squees
D'AW!
SO ADORABLE!
This is epic
filly shy cute
Tree powers activate!
10,02Well, he would like to schedule a meeting with BronyState to go over the details
1,3I think I have a few versions of this in my pony folder
Did anypony else see the hilarity of Fluttershy being assigned to helping with the trees in the new episode?
fluttershy is a tree
d'aawwwww
dat AppleBloom solo
That was one of the final gags in World of Ponycraft-- Fluttershy the Resto Druid-- who wanted to level up so she could be a tree.
10,02Right now, I'm just presenting the idea to you all and see if you any of you are interested in this.
IshBestPony: yes we did
DA'
Oh fuck
I saw the Thor pony
W
ANOTHER MEETING
i hate that fanfic

04If you make this SNES like

What fanfic?
well...I guess the flash game can be put on hold...again
Oh dear GOD
Granny Smith is not a Scootaloo
Kinda sounds like Chrono Trigger and FF
this is so amazing
i love the squees

06OOONNNEEE MOOORRE THING

World of Ponycraft. What if instead of Worgen in Cataclysm... it was Ponies as the new race?
06Jackiiieeee
mouth even
1,3lol
04There better be sidequests and legend equipment
I just made that reference
06Ayyyyaaaaaaa~
In the admin chat
About 10 minutes ago
06.-.
my throat is sore from all this d'awwww.
WHY ARE PEOPLE IN MY HEAD TODAY
06dat herdmind <3

lol
party soft
soft heavy metal
This guy even worked in Nightmare Moon into WoW lore-- almost perfectly.
party soft dude
Yeah it is
xD
bribe them
I forgot my trademark fluttershy response...
Worgen spelt backwards is negrow just saying
Kencolt: you sir, that is a million dollar idea
ish so cute
/me seizure
haha
lol
ill put a couple of things on every week
SkilledSkillet: taht is....a odd word phonetically
wow, those MLP HP's were hoaxes
pay some of the bills
10,02So, what do you all think? Something you'd be interested in discussing it further? He seems very excited at the prospect of partnering with us.
eww World of Warcraft
http://i42.tinypic.com/300qjcl.jpg Oh hey, this is pretty neat.
SKilledSkillet: O U
It's a 12 chapter long epic-- and I men epic in both dark and hilarity.
11,01Right to a pony game. Things just get better and better.
/me begins using his gravitational pull to pull everypony into a glomp pile
just change Pandaren to Horde, and Ponies to Alliance next expac
11,01I would.
ITS SO ADORABLE I CANT TAKE IT
not the glomp!
ME NIETHER
everyone wins
11,01Just to get involved.
^
04...dear god, this looks complicated
Kencolt: What would the Pony mounts be?
everyone loses
is that spanish?
[01:10] So the game will only be available from our site or what?
10,02However, please note, the game is still in the Alpha stages as the team is currently small.
http://www.ebay.com/itm/220943451357?ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1555.l2649
[01:09] <Ghosties> What will we get for publishing rights besides exclusivity? Cameos, etc.?
Look at the username
speaking of ponies and WoW there was a pretty funny thread about pony mounts lately. http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3941586552
/me drools at the thought of the game becoming a worldwide hit with BronyState as the publisher
EspyLacopa: dragons ofc
yes its spanish
[01:09] So what does he want from us in return
lolwut
adorable
/me stops seizuring
*squee squee squee*
06Your soul.
that was awesome
is it over yet?
/me makes his gravity equal to IshBestPony and escapes the glomp
/me is welcoming the glomp pile
NO
06Oh no, he wants something more. . .
EspyLacopa: Tank
11,01Oh please don't let BronyState go public.
06He wants..
my life is over.
Engineer Pinkie.
06A MEETING
lol
06WITH YOU
XD
whoops
hahaha
They don't have mounts-- until level 60, Like Worgen they just lear4n to run faster. Actually, a bit faster than anyone else-- it's a racial.
10,02He wants to use our fanbase to gain awareness of his game and gather more people to work on it
/me increases his gravity and pulls Midnight_Tempest in
06I was a part of Bronystate before it became manestream~
04OH NOES, NOT ANOTHER MEETING
10,02Fanbase meaning 'BronyState viewers'
/me pushes up glases
...
There is no escape
04Hah
search flutterstep on youtube for more adorableness :D
Another meeting?
04I don't see a problem with that
I'd rather die
:D
/me gets pulled into the pile
10,02O U
07,01lawl
/me collapses in on himself and pull IshBestPony into his own glomp pile
3x3
i heard that
trust me i can't stop
amazing
I think one Seizure is enough for now
how do you do that6_9
06Ghosties sees no problem
/me notices sudden change in gravity
06ARE YOU INSANE???
06;A;
04I mean, if he wants to use our fanbase to gain awareness and help then awesome
oh shi- no no no no
So what you mean by we'll be the publishers?
YES
oh god
What does that mean for us?
indeed they do youtube
/me increases his gravity to remain the center of the glomp pile
oh how they do!
ahahaha
/me trains in the increased gravity
/me tackle-glomps everypony attempting to escape back into the glomp pile
04That makes it a primary BronyState IP
lol that lag ruined it
Twilight's an Arcane Mage-- once she trains up, and an Archology freak. Rainbow dash is a Ret paladin, who prefers PvP. Fluttershy is, as I said, a Restoration Druid... so che can help critters.
Chariots like in the first episode , or Flying Carpets might work for ponys
10,02^
Yes this song!
04Which means we'd have all the rights
10,02Pretty much
yay song time
Buffer....
so much glomping @_@
kirzstryfe: why you no mod?
:(
*holds onto random, convenient lamp post*

10,02The irony of busting people for pirating our game.

11,01Also, it needs multiplayer.
#brony
dam you lag!
0,5Including playable characters such as Luna, Ghosties and Violet

10,02But Val can go first, then I'll go after
Well, just a reminder that I'm trying to get a team together for a flash game (to get our DA page going). But if we devote resources to this other thing, it would be impractical to do that at the same time
haha yeah they did
did youtube plan this?

RawketLawnchair: um, don't know

I can definitely help with that.

damnit RAWRity
04Dari, what you need is relatively simple: a jar of molasses
zeppony: well, I don't hold any ill will towards brony on a whole either. Just some people are trouble

0,5Is the meeting over?
pokemon! :D
oh god this
04NO
Nope
the only difference between #brony and #bronystate
what in the world
10,02Anyway, as some of you probably DON'T know, there's a channel on IRC that's dedicated to Netherland Bronies (*looks at Luna*) #broniesnl , they are planning on having a meetup February 4th...
ponymon
04IT'S NOT OVER
What the...
This song caused mass-suicides in Japan...
._.
well, most of the time I can
0,5THis random talk is, well, random
is that #brony has way fewer rules. that's it
eeyup
not sure if want
I don't understand what reference am I missing here?
oh god, lavender town was the creepiest game town ever when I was a youn fillie
this song haunts me...
At least that's what I heard..
of course, that leads to cultural differences as well
Oh
ahaha
06I knew this SB.
You mentioned this
ikr
*young
its fun but challenging
can someone tell me what is bad about this song?
this song is kinda depressing....
well that too
eeyup
Earlier in Skype
Or someone did
06I have been in all of those rooms <3 continue~
I remember reading a creepypasta about Lavender Town
JTDrift: ghost pokemon
no shit O_O
Well... I dunno about the brony thing, never been there...
;)
have you read the creepy pasta about it?
when your in college youl deal with some classes that you have to pass if you want to graduate
ponies cancel that out
JTDrift its just depressing
that was some scary shiz ;___;
There's this creepypasta thingy about this, don't read it
10,02They were first interested in streaming our livestream of the Pony Episode while even offering to mention us if we setup a private stream page for them.
the cemetary building was cool though
10,02HOWEVER
Supposivly it caused mass-suicides
Nah gimme link?
I hum this song whenever im in a cemetary
06OH!
:'(
ah! to kikis to find out horror goodness!
06I remember this
actually, there's probably about ten million Lavender Town creepypastas
lolnice
wikis*
there is supposedly a high pitched sound that hurt kids ears, nothing more
ah 1st gen pokemon, how we love you so. :3
I was doing it at my granfathers funeral
by accident
<3
uh oh
i got smacked
10,02They are now also interested in if we would like to stream their event for a while with over 100 bronies going crazy (and possibly going nuts over BronyState).
What do they even want on a private stream page?
where?
wow this quest is easy
in the knee
with an arrow
I still play first-gen pokemon from time to time
10,02Just the stream and maybe their name or something.
haha
all the tea
lol
same
First Gen is best Gen
Yes it is
10,02I don't know, but it's not that hard to do and they'll thank BronyState as a sponsor
what song is this from?
hahaha
It was a great generation
is the stream not working for anyone else?
mine just crashed
what from is this song
Second Gen is best Gen
brb refreshing
so....how was the new episode?
We should go for it IMO
Mine is still working
good
good
Since not really any effort on our part.
same
really satifisfying
Mine as well
0,14^
bad
another applejack episode
ine is stll working *knocks on wood*
oops typo
i meant good
mine also works
13can have page with name and stream done in like.. two minutes
Sparkwarning : well, basacally acording to the creepypasta, the first wave of pokemon games released made some kids insane, and thats why they changing
1st generation is the best and always will be, after the 1st it started to go a little overboard, 2nd was cool though
which made it worse
lol
10,02<HerderBezem> just brainstorming here, imagine we get a videostream running of about 100 silly dutchmen getting pumped for the next ep, how big is the chance we would get a couple of seconds airtime on bronystate? ():)
10,02Faster than you can say SILLY FILLY :3
I like the first gen of pokemon, the second one is also ok, but I haven't cared for any later generations
I agree, I didn't play past the 2nd gen
epic comment
Thanks for that Mr
it seems like I'm the only person who really likes Gen 3
...This sounds very familiar.
Cicero=Joker

If possible people should try to be there for at least an hour before then pony episode starts. I noticed this morning that there were very few mods on then (maybe 3 at most including me), but there were at least 300 people in the chat already.
Do it Saxy!
then take a little something sweet
why is Pinkie so white?
So at least as many or more than we get for BMN.
10,02Sorry SaxyPretender, after dari then ;___;

10,02That is true...but it's 6 AM for me an hour early...
Applejack looks way too excited
so much /me...
04Yeah, that's a main reason why I drafted the mod infractions
So if possible try to be in for an hour, even half an hour before the pony episode starts.
>bring up time to dari
All you gotta do is take a cup of coc-caine add it to the mix! next mix something a little sweet not sour, a little weed just a pinch..
>bitch you about to die

VioletVanilla: why ._.?

Familiar playlist is very familiar...

Only in the sideshow.

04Did you put anything up this weekend for Steam?

04VAL D:

Fleur, you really want to become a mod don't you?
Fleur = best hug victim
13fleur ist nicht mod...
this was a good try but it kinda falls appart the farther it gets from the original bit. still fun though.
0,14Example: SB is streaming stuff, our FB/G+/Twitter pages update to reflect
04MAYBE IF YOU WOULD BE MORE AFFECTIONATE TO OUR COUCH
Fleur is an honorary mod
04It needs love too...
nice
06. . .
what was your major?
Shizuka is best mod
06.-.
A pretty flower;)
Fleur: true, but I was just joking
he would make a good mod
13yet... we may have to kidnap her next time there ist recruiting
i was seting it up to play this on my TV and my came on comp screen but the sond wastn playing off me TV so i spent that whole time fixing it then...
04We have a couch in the Steam skype group :I
gummy is best pny

hmmm...nothing?
pfft
I am not a mod... I didnt even get an interview
04It's comfy
13we do?
10,02I'm not a Silly Filly? D:

nowaithhhnnnngggggg
Tank is best pet

SuperBrony64: hand it off to Sumica
07,01Anything else?
SuperBrony64 Go to bed.
GODDAMIT
O_O
06Anything else?
I am not a mod and would love to be, however I couldn't handle the awesomeness of being a mod, especially since Fleur deserves it more. Also SB is no silly filly
07,01No more things?
0,14I had another point, but fuck that shit, let's end this. I can always talk about that on forums.
06NINJAD
