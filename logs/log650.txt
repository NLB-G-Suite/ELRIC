Oh, you're talking about /those/ sorts of things.
Dovah: all you did was call me ignorant and accused me of not playing the game, it was just a politician battle with no intellecutal gains, dont waste my time ever again
yes
ello comrades
Sorry, overlooked those.
no one cares about kinect
Mostly because personally I don't pay attention to them, sorry.
Bronysith: hush. don't start something
hi Comrade Dken2021
hi Dken2021
Shizuka: could you repost that plz? my flash crashed as you posted it
well i only look hardware and software wise
thx
hi Dken2021 :)
Same here. I just tend to overlook stuff like Avatars/Miis.
AjIsAwesome yay he has the spanish rom :)
Yeah, Avatars were completely a copy of Wii's Miis. Possibly they might have been an upgrade, but who cares about them really?
eh well no worrys i found it quite fun and even won a few games of chess :)
xbox > failed to add wi-fi > avatars > better store
flutter_spin: i still think its an awesome site, they have tons of cool stuff like the drawfriends and animations and such
But the reason why my fanfic is obviously flawed: 1st person, self-insert, original character, similiar color/name/preferences as Twilight Sparkle, meets mane 6, doesn't have a cutie mark.
Hi Dken2021
Better Store? As i- Yeah I'll give you that.
twilight_sprinkle: Agreed.
But I love every bit of it.
Cutie marks are too.mainstream
and well same goes for sony who did add the wifi and better graphics
DerpyMuffins: what are the rules
flutterchu oh ,your fic didn't get get that much praise?
All ze graphics everywhere
I will contest, however
Dken2021: le misping
they outright copy the first one and upgrade everything it have
d'oh
No and I quote "X-rated content, including sexually transgressive or gorey stories"
Perhaps from a software standpoint.
Dken2021: i didnt finish a fanfic what are you talking about
Dken2021: Naw. I threw it up and people didn't care for it. I revised it, but still nothing.
I have a feeling that Sony was doing their own thing, though. However I can't back this up having never touched a single Sony product other than my PSP
We're gonna get in a lot of trouble whether we honor our agreement or not... especially if Romney is present by the time this war goes hot.
(which I adore due to cracking shenanigans and Dissidia)
DerpyMuffins is that only one of the rules?
And now we talkin bout war
About graphics, though.
6I have 11482 favourites on dA.. o.0
There is a few more
:O
thats alot :P
I feel obligated to mention that, despite the graphics limitation, some of the most artistically beautiful games are on the Wii.
6Yeah xD
13was the ambassador the eve player or was that a different diplomat?
PS3 has some too, but they aren't games that use the graphics engine for its intended purpose (playing Crysis)
^ Joke
13saw a bunch of reddit threads about how eve online has come to a halt for a memorial, really nice
6It's 3 years worth of favs but it still seems like too many :P
O.o
HAY GUYS
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6de_DXS4z4 watch dis
Heck, even the 360 had beautiful artistic games.
hallo Flootahshy
Actually
sup Flootahshy
13note to self
Fuck everything I've said before
13english needs syntax highlighting
DerpyMuffins: lol you beat me. I was checking out the japan-china story thing
hi Flootahshy
hi Flootahshy :)
Why is the chat dead?
I'm happy that more art games are happening.
Syntax highlighting?
Flootahshy: no stream
its like 10:25PM and I should be going to be.... naw screw it! ponies are worth it.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RSF7Z8nGwQ&feature=BFa&list=FL5QyBGi4t1uDa0FwakXNeYQ
13been reading C source most of the day...
One does not simply have too many favorites
13huge block of chat text without colors is making my eyes blurry..
6xDDD
flutter_spin: What are you talking about? The Buffer Show is a GREAT show!
We would use colours, but we'd get kicked for it.
AJIsAwesome: my childhood... so awesome.
Silly, don't lament your own rules.
Ok I might have a chance of getting on EqD
AJIsAwesome: I always thought about that. I don't like freeform jazz. I don't like freeform anything. Just noise.
/me 5 i dunno i don't think it has been fix so far
nope
AjIsAwesome dat spongebob scene :D
here comes the kick
13forget who's running color kicks but ja ctcps still aren't checked
Anyway, Trix...what I'm saying is, I prefer games like Masamune that have an "artsy" style.
flutter_spin: That's alright. That's your opinion, and I'm going to let you have it. :)
Reikim i liked okami
Or Okami.
6Kinda wish I hadn't eaten those cookies 4 hours ago..
Okami is a damn beautiful game.
flutter_spin according to spongebob we must appreciate it to become a man!
But yeah, none of my stories (http://www.fimfiction.net/index.php?view=category&user=30937) will ever reach EQD
Why?
6Brb..need to find something to eat.. ._.
I'm sick of the market's massive bias towards "realistic" graphics.
haha k
6Cause I'm hungry and there isn't much atm xD
flutter_spin: they didnt even read one paragraph of my fic
But that's just me.
6:O Noodles..k,brb xD
flutter_spin never know man
TheGreatAndPowerfulT, that has been fixed, but neither of the people with the kickbot are here
flutter_spin: All these made by you?
Bronysith: yeah. I think they read the first chapter and stopped. I think I remember you saying that before too.
Bronysith: your fic was actully cool.
k
Bronysith Really? But its a fuckin awesome fic
flutter_spin: they read one sentence man
Does BP do that?
Reikim, not yet because lazy
flutter_spin: "oh another star wars fic" didnt even give it a fair shot
Flootahshy: yeah. I'm still working on 2 more fics. One is 2,000 words so far (one shot) and the other highlights Su... a Bronystate mod (10,000 words in so far)
mmmmm
DAFUQ DAFUQ DAFUQ DAFUQ DAFUQ WHATS WITH FIMFICTION PIC
Bronysith: what is the name of it, sounds like it might be interesting
flutter_spin: Reading one. As of now.
Anyway
I'll be fair with all consoles.
I don't think any console is "better" than another.
Weeeird... I just saw an Aj x rarity pic.in fimfiction
I WANT THAT PICTURE
It's the devs and the publishers that make the difference.
a console is a tool
Oh Bronysith worked hard on his fics. I still have a hard time reading other fics, though.
It's how they are used.
Well its turns out my fiction is more original than I thought it was and the EqD is gonna get back to me
^
For example, the PS3.
Freefall29: my fic wasnt that great man, stop kissing ass
Flootashy just refresh till u get the pic
It started off badly because nobody could figure out the processor system.
Then it got better.
cachi01|phone: oh yeah. Fimfiction has new ... shipping banners
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6de_DXS4z4 <- this
cachi01|phone: No, the Pinkie/RD pic.
Then the entire market got flooded with FPS clones.
bad game companys can produce crap on any console
WUT
DAFUQ
You can scroll through all of them.
Freefall29: one day you say, not good, next day it is amazing, then 3rd day not good then 4th day it is amazing
/me refreshes fimfiction
Then graphics became more important than gameplay.
But now...
13speaking of, i get the sense chat's had enough mvm stream for a while
cachi01|phone: It's funny. You want to get featured on Fim Fiction, just put shipping into one of your fics.
A couple friends of mine on Fimfiction have agreed that the site has gone downhill. They really don't have standards much anymore.
13unless someone else goes, i might stream, but at a loss as to what..
We've also got gems like The Last of Us coming out.
13unless i did day after tomorrow rifftrax tonight
Bronysith: I really can't decide if I like it or hate it. the hype was just getting to me.
Shizuka stream guns of icarus :p
I still have not gotten over that one...
Yes
13don't have that..
I'm looking for an excuse to play- dammit
is it me, or is fimfiction actually supports shipping?
13oh that was the beta thing
AjIsAwesome ikr lol
i gave you a key
13still don't have it
And dat RD x PP is cute
Trix gave you a key...
Dken2021: shipping and love stories in general
and sex
lots of sex stories
lots of se
/me 13checks log
Dammit ninja'd
6Back.. ^^
Fimfiction supports? ... Fimfiction doesn't care if you have gore, etc in your fics.. as long as you tag them.
13wasn't this month was it
The only thing they care is if there are ponies from the show and it isn't a metafic
around2 weeks i think
Oh, Trix
or My inmortal..... Pony version.....
About system copying.
6Now I just have to turn off the beeping thing as soon as possible so my mom doesn't wake up.. ^^
I finally got my research links open...
13would have been august then, PMs are purged at the end of the month on my system
flutter_spin: and dont forget, if there is a human in there then it is a no no according to EQD
Yeah, they copied off one another, but only in software.
heh, the things they let you get away with these days.....
just because my OC was human then became a pony it is automatically bad
fuck you EQD
I have a lot of work to do for my fics, but I've slowed down a lot. I'm being careful with my writing style.
and go fuck your electric sockets
The base systems, as they were released, could not have been clones. They were too close together.
13could l4d1 some more.. haven't streamed blood harvest recently
whoa.
i don't delete my keys until sure
Hm
Electick sockets lolwut
We still haven't played Alien Swarm, have we?
don't think so
Bronysith take in mind, that the staff has probably seen those fics a thousand times
We should do that.
electric*
13alien swarm was kind of... eh..
Dken2021: so? that doesnt give them an excuse to not read the whole thing and give i t a fair opionon
Anyone seen Reikim anywhere?
Hey, when I posted my fic... I never knew about the whole 1 fic per 5minutes
It's fun with friends.
13may have just been the people we got stuck with but i didn't find it particularly interesting :/
DerpyMuffins: Nope
or is it 10minutes, whatever
lol
Dken2021: they are like "oh human right" toss into garbage
It's more fun when you have good people.
I spent a solid three hours on it once with a friend.
Dken2021: they literally judge stories by teh covers
Its one of their rules
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7Hiqa8ainU&feature=plcp
Part of the problem was there were only two of us, but eh.
no stream?
what do you think about it so far?
Is otakon in chat?
Dark92Enigma: nope.avi
No human fanfics
no
Damn, no
ello DarkStratos, doesn't seem like it
He would have been hilarious.
aw
"holy shit this is amazi- oh wait. Human" *drops it to trash*
well i have to call an airstrike on jersey
but it's fine, we're still here
cachi01|phone: exactly
Are you people talking about Equestria Daily now?
Ooooh
Shizuka, have you played Dear Esther?
13the original
I read "Drocsid" (the more completed fic) to my cousin. He liked it. My boss read the first chapter of it. He was blown away.
BC I had them wish me luck with my fic
Chat might like that one.
13followed the remake development up until he disappeared to make it a $10 mod
yep.
Yeah, that sucked.
If EQD doesnt want to post human fics, then theres probably a reason for it, and its still an awesome site. Its like a capital city of the fandom. I wont complain if they change something because its like complaining that someone gave you 200 bucks and then asked 50 back.
When people who don't know about writing or the community read my fics, they like it.
Drocsid........ Thats celestia backwards right?
I got the original a while ago. Fun little one-hour game.
Mind screwy.
13the original had some major sound problems for me
twilight_sprinkle: Agreed.
Hm?
he hates ignitus O_O
why would celestia have a d in it
cachi01|phone: Yes. :P
cachi01|phone: You have to say something about it everytime, eh?
13like the narration worked but the music was way choppy
cachi01|phone: fucking really?
13sounded awful
flutter_spin hehe, clever naming
Never experienced that.
I did manage to break the game though by going places I wasn't supposed to.
Dken2021: Took me 3 weeks to come up with
You never notice that Dken?
celestiad
Reikim did you check " To the moon" ?
Ah, Equestria Daily. Who knew a man who jacks it to dragons and a blue pompous asshole could lead such a thing.
Right, not that then.
Stanley Parable?
flutter_spin everytime huh?
13could do stanley again
13encore of my first stream
Buytoast: do you even know him?
DerpyMuffins about as creative as Cinos
Done all the routes yet?
13oh yes
BLONIC
13my first stream was 45 minutes, all endinggs
cachi01|phone: uhhh, I recall 4 times. I may have linked it more than that here.
Oh my
i dont feel like talking about the lameness in EQDs fanfiction policies
Quite the nostalgia trip then.
cool Bayonetta 2 is coming out...exclusive to Wii U
13waaaay back in february
im goign for a very enthusiastic walk
Ikr
Fucking 349 dollars i dont have
cachi01|phone: I"M NOT JOHNNY QUEST! I'M MY ORIGINAL CHARACTER, JOHNNY TEST!
13freespace and darwinia are still on the FINISH STREAMING ME shelf but i'm not much up for them..
You can getthe 299 one you know
EqD isnt that bad. They must have put a ban on human fanfics for a reason
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Still better than not getting it at all.
AND IM.NOT SCOOBY DOO. IM MY ORIGINAL CHARACTER DUKE
night all
bye bronysith
night Bronysith :)
seeya Bronysith
I started the Stanley Parable with the "blow everything up" ending.
night Bronysith
I just wish I would have some proof-readers. Everybody I talk to is like me - "I write, but I don't read"
bye Bronysith
Cya Bronysith
wait, they actually flat out put a ban on human stories there now?
I panicked pretty hard when everything became hopeless.
Buytoast: pretty much
6Back
Yup
yup
ahaha
what's wrong with human fics
front
Dont you read teh memos?
Buytoast: that also goes for "a brony in equestria" even if they are turned into a pony
better not defile seth's precious trixie by making it human
I LIKE PIE
I guess since they've seen so much of it, they get tired of seeing another one
flutter_spin: i read, but i dont write, much :P
13you heard there's a remake of that coming ja?
Anyway, if you still have the beta key for GoI
Remake?
13it's on greenlight
Probably because the ones usually sent in before were not well developed fics or just plain terrible ones.
Dovah: It's two-fold. I want people to read my fics, but if they don't - I understand.
key is not working for some reason
/me Throws himself across the chat
(awkward moment when two people type something in at the same time)
Well Im doing pretty good for a first time writer
13coming up fast now that black mesa is ready
/me catches Ponies47
Wait
Black Mesa is ready?
I just like the references to the bronystate moderators in my fics
13http://blackmesasource.com/
1312 hours
...
/me flips
AJIsAwesome: I was trying to fly! D:
13so at the least
the datacenter that berry is in is still broken
AJIsAwesome: But nice catch :P
/me flips Trixie
ohh yeah must re-install half life
13the NEXT time i stream i'll be doing that
/me flips Shizu
wait, is there such a rule for a pony in the real world?
flutter_spin: i'd read them, eventualy :P i procrastinate like a boss
Ponies47: But you can't fly. :( Also, thanks. :$
"Moon Time" might not be fleshed out, but Wr.... a special artist is in there
/me 13is upside down .-.
And it's free, isn't it?
it's
I can finally play Half-Life.
is not complete
DerpyMuffins: What story was it?
My fanfic remember....
cool. I watch EqD in non-fanfiction mode
It releases in twelve hours.
is just until what chapter was it
i forgot
I think they want a link DerpyMuffins
And they completely redid the soundtrack.
To?
You know what, the people who did this? They're just awesome.
/me laughs
The fic.
I worship these people as demigods.
Seven years? Dedication.
I guess I'm not the only one having an odd day
/me takes Derpm muffins and muffins derpy
DerpyMuffins: *
damn tab fail
Out of cookies, but I do have ice cream
Only 5 days old and already up to 1200 views! http://www.fimfiction.net/story/50037/The-heart-wants-what-the-heart-wants.
So anyway, to return to earlier
/me gives flutter_spin cookies.
Shizu, if you can get GoI, we can begin forming TEAM BRONYSTATE
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EfhAFA2yFE&feature=youtube_gdata_player because <-------- Me when i got all the boos in luigis mansion
No one reads my blogs tho....
And then maybe enter tourney
DerpyMuffins: concrats on being number 77 on my read later list :D
77?
Who wants some nostalgia? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6WZlQuCOKE&feature=BFa&list=FL5QyBGi4t1uDa0FwakXNeYQ
i procrastinat..... A LOT
DerpyMuffins: really? I post to my blog ALL THE TIME. I freak out when 1 person comments
Damn too late but whatever
I love you AJIsAwesome.
flutter_spin: links, i needs them now pls
hey the devs of TF2 want user created halloween ideas to make! pretty cool...wish my pc could run it lol
AjIsAwesome no. This is the scene where you GET LOST :
PinkiePry: Thanks. :$
Only 1 person raeds my blogs....
:D
XD
Dovah: links to....?
ur fics n stuff
my blog?
So Shizu, solved your problem yet?
http://www.fimfiction.net/user/flutterspin
Valve wants ideas for halloween? *cough*slenderman*cough*
My plot isnt going very well thought
13not yet, said the key was in use somehow .-.
13am still coding
I still need a way to get the Mare 6 into it
13attention ponies
13in 12 hours
Mm? Coding what?
13black mesa source releases
13which happens to be 8:47am mountain time
/me is now stalking flutter_spin and DerpyMuffins on fimfiction
neato
13also known as the time gordon freeman enters the test chamber
I like stalkers!
Shizuka: :O
Lol theres a fic about twilight being an MLG
13C
13the hard way
Shizuka: this game is gonna kick ass
13(so it says)
well theyre more like skin ideas like Pyro head is brain in a jar,etc. :$
So just doing practice then?
13basically
Does it at least give you practice problems?
http://derpy.me/kewzk
13http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/
13am up to ex19 which is shoehorning objects into C
Oh yey it's free!
JESmith71: :D
6Looks pretty good! :O
Dat Discord being Discord
Objects in C...I thought there was a way of doing that already?
Or was that C++?
6xD
I'm gonna go to bed everypony. bye
laters Freefall29
Cya Freefall29
6That was the Chronicler Ignitus,right?
yeah
flutterchu: I have no idea, but that reminded me of: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv4E9175EOY
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOEmwC6zfXo&feature=youtube_gdata_player
13C++ does objects, C is too dumb to get it
Does anypony think Valve is gonna make another Portal? (I wub Portal :3)
Blargh
Why bother learning it then?
13i kind of stopped five lectures into the stanford programming paradigms videos cause i was getting too confused by pointers and stuff
13so i'm learning up from bare metal :3
Does anypony think Valve is gonna release another Portal? (I wub Portal :3)
who knows?
Well, I'm going to be without my mom's laptop at that time.
JESmith71: they look like dogs
Uh uh
I know there's still a lot out there that's programmed in C, but I thought it was being all phased out in favour of C++?
13you can do C in C++, though i think there's a couple things you're supposed to change
When I tried both I found C++...easier? More fluid? More elegant?
I'm fine with the ending given in Portal 2, IMO.
Elegant's probably a good word.
13but otherwise C is still huge because there's compilers for it on practically everything
c++ confuses me
13you could compile C on toast i'm sure
13not the toaster, the toast
PinkiePry the prequel without portals they were planning to do maybe
Could say the same baout Java.
*about
i meen clases are simple enough, but refference types? streams?
ah
Portal 0?
Night everypony
Yeah
its bizare
night Dovah :)
Night Dovah
seeyas Dovah
I love classes.
13streams get into how unix does stuff i think
13how everything is a file
Classes are happiness for me, having done what little program I have.
*programming
yes it is night time, that is what i just said :D
that moment when one of your favorite artists uploads the first tune in 3 months :P
night Dovah
God bless you coding people..... I felt like my brain was melting in my java class yesterday :(
lol jk
13my programming started in autoit which also didn't understand objects... so i forced it to
13with a four dimensional array
but really i need sleeps
/me is not a coding person, merely knowledgeable enough to pretend he knows what he's talking about
flutter_spin: Are you talking about Celestia and Luna without their manes?
I've been out of it all day. I took a nap and snapped out of bed thinking "My alarm didn't go off! I'm late!" and running out the door I said "Wait, its 6PM"
JESmith71: yes
...Actually I could apply that statement to everything I say.
I think I disappoint people a lot.
i'm seeing if i can get another key btw
I'm off to bed for tonight.

"Oh my god you're so intelligent!" "Actually I was bullshitting you, sorry."
Night, Nittany_Discord! Get some rest! :)
I played some Starcraft 2, but I kept running into idiots. One person asked when Heart of the Swarm patch was coming. He snapped when I told him he had to buy it.
Says a little something about the gullibility of the average person.
Goodnight Nittany_Discord !
seeya nitty
Cya Nittany_Discord
bye Nittany_Discord
Bye Nittany_Discord
I really picture a new portal as a more open world style. I'm not saying rpg or anything, but maybe use of a portal gun on the outside world. That would be fun
Cya Nittany_Discord
~ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbE9-3s7qvo classic.
....people seriously didn't know that the Starcraft expansions would need to be purchased?
How can you be that dumb? ._.
CK|Catnap: I know.
Pinkiepry i would rather ask for the prequel
Hey everyone I just walked in and I not- O_O The NewSuperBronyU?!?!
PinkiePry too bad that none of the surfaces in the open world are made of moondust
I'm liking this book, Shizu.
The author has a personality. I'm not falling asleep.
13http://hg.vortalcord.net/learnc/src can look at the hideous results too :3
NewSuperBronyU Y U ONLY HAVE 8 GB
But I love play 3v3VH AI on Starcraft 2. The new players really stand out.
i dont have 349 dollars to get the 32 GB one :(
I thought that maybe they would make something like a portable container of moondust? I'm a silly fillie. XD And to cachi, if they did a prequel I would want to find out why Chell is deaf.
deaf?
Chell's deaf?
She aint deaf
Still no stream? O.O
sorry, mute
By the way......i'm trying to get into the survey.......but it won't let me sign in with my e-mail
do you mean mute?
yeah
PinkiePry: Oh.
my bad :$
No prob.
Dark92Enigma: Try using the home page of the site.
Ok
I played TF2 for the 1st time on PC
how was it?
...Well the Hello World isn't hideous.
Guild Wars 2 sells 2 million copies in first 2 weeks. That's cool.
I knew the headstart at around 400,000
OctoG123 is best pony

Time for sleep!! Goodnight, Bronystate! Take care! :)
AJIsAwesome: that clip. Sadly, I can't say that around work. They think I say something else.
13he might be grabbing some from K&R, dunno
Night RaveBrony :)
13i have some version of the K&R bible here but never dove in

flutter_spin: Is it what I think it is?
13OOOOOOOOOOOOLD
13seriously eqd keep up with reddit
Thank you for the links AJIsAwesome
I blame Seth.
Why? Because why not.
Kinixys: No prob
well I've always kind of had a problem with speech. I'm also quiet (like Fluttershy).
lol half of the things they post i already see them
So my 'th' may come out as 'f' and my 'v' come out as 'b'

though I prefer Julius's theme
HEY GUYS!
I think it's partially because of the Netvvork fiasco.
Anyone see the new TFS video yet?
Hi otakon. :)
It's pretty funny if short
otakon: TFS?
They might be checking what they get more thoroughly now.
HI otakon :)
It's hot :(
Team Four Star
yup saw it, it was ok
Plus they have to wade through, what, several thousand e-mails a day?
and hello there otakon
Team Four Star? Never heard of it. :$
Hi otakon
AJIsAwesome: O_o
Still, they could at least employ people just to watch these specific things...
hiya Dken2021 and CCCP
DBZ Abridged
AJIsAwesome: GO LOOK IT UP NOW DAMMIT
MASF123: :P

AJIsAwesome: NOW! and LAUGH YOUR ASS OFF

otakon: meh, season 2 was good, but season 1 was pretty dull
Arrays are fairly understandable.
"let go of my food, my friend, my emergency food, and my son, all in that order"
13i think i had help from the paradigms videos and from doing hack on understanding pointers/arrays
I don't know why I bother going to the Minecraft Middle-Earth server. People freak out when I tell them I never read the books.

One thing I really hate about C? Using backslash.
Lord of the Rings
flutter_spin: YOU ARE ON A SERVER DEDICATED TO THE FICTION
Such a completely unnatural motion for me.
flutter_spin: KNOWING the fiction before hand is kind of expected
otakon: lol. I know! To make things even funnier, one of the main guys on the server is named "Eeyup"
Yes, they take MLP seriously over there
13been doing all my work in vim so far... esc is throwing me off more than everything else
AjIsAwesome are you AjTheMightygamee in youtube?
Matt's doing somthing stupid isnt he/HELLO EVERYONE I GOT A NEW KEYBOARED

About the only thing I'm any good with is Visual Basic, and that barely even qualifies as a language anymore.
13vim's a text editor
aw i do AJIsAwesome
13locked in an eternal holy war with emacs
To any mod available: I tried to access the survey for the lottery, i write my name, last name, and then i go for the e-mail. IT'S ALL DOWNHILL from there......the page says: ''the e-mail you used is already registered'' WTF??? Do i have to make a new e-mail or something? And YES i tried from the homepage, but same result.......can any(mod)pony help me? :(
Do their clashes sear the land with divine flame and scar it eternally with the brands of the gods?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjK-LzkekCU&feature=youtube_gdata_player LOL
WHY? Why Eddsworld!? Why did you have to make that PMV to Yaplap of Fluttershy? Freaked me out!
13that's part of this book, you do stuff at the command line, no IDE or fancy schmancy abstractions between you and bare metal
13just about
That'sssss a very niccccceee email you have there...
13consider vi vs emacs has been going on since the 70s
ohai Israphel :)
i just realized somthing
Famitracker, WHY YOU MAKE SUCH BIG WAV FILES ??? :[
Herbert reference much?
oh. He didn't make it. He just faved it. Well.. same thing
13i think emacs runs on "we can do more than text edit" while vi runs on "we only text edit, but we do it well!"
13vim is an enhanced fork of vi, i like it cause for plain editing you don't have to dig too far in
Im happy, I finally finished an original 8 bit piece :)
flutter_spin: I was going to say. I don't remember them making that.
Can we hear it oni_link?
It was on the main page. The UI is weird.
or see it or wutever lul
flutter_spin: You mean Featured?
I'm trying to dig up what I remember from Eddsworld
...
Bookmarking this for now and going back to my writing.
No. My brother works for newgrounds and I remember seeing his stuff on the site

Or rather, fixing other people's writing.
Terminator 3: Skynet needs more money, and to screw up a perfectly good cannon ending to the two-movie series.
Every tense shift I see makes me want to stab something.
Also, its loud guys sorry to tell you a bit late :P
its going to kill me unless I figure out the exact video

THATS IT! http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/382765 "Sugar, Sugar"
cachi01|phone: I told you :/
Should've bugged you for one rather than buying the game.
I think that's the title.
You should make a video telling spyro fans to come here. I can't make one cuz of my stupid computer -_-
Seen it

heh. Rose's older sounding voice didn't do it for me. Now Junebug. Junebug's voice is awesome.
Thank you for understanding the English language.
cachi01|phone: I really love the way the ending came out :3
My issue is with things like this:
DO NOT MAKE A GODDAMN SEQUEL!
"It has only been a few days since Nightmare Night, but Luna still remembered it like it had happened only a mere few hours ago"
13mere few
otakon: I HAVE N IDEA. The trailer on Youtube has a MASSIVE AMOUNT of dislikes.

Let's play Spot Reikim's Bersek Trigger~

G'night.

JESmith71: challenge accepted
/me 13starts rereading to parse in grammar nazi mode... slowly curls up into a ball...
oni_link with which program did you made it?
Incidentally, the same thing happens over and over across some several thousand words.
otakon: Prepare to have your jimmies rustled.
night Kinixys :)
lol
Good evenink, bronystate
thank gd for that at least
So. Tense shifts. Stabbity stabbity.
Hi HoodyNinja. :)

Going to bed. Peace :D

Bye AJ.
No stream? :o
Hi HoodyNinja
13few days, few hours
ello there HoodyNinja
cachi01|phone: thanks :) thats my original piece for that Famicompo-Mini competition I told you about. And that was all done on Famitracker, and its a straight up 2A03 (stock NES) song with no samples for the drums :3
At least Hansel and Gretel: Witchhunters looked interesting
13only a mere few hours is making my hair stand on end...
Not that I would ever see it.
hi HoodyNinja
NewSuperBronyU: silly
0,14say what
Well, to be fair, that's not /technically/ incorrect.
It's just really, really bad.
13it's horribly redundant
/me pulls AJIsAwesome, otakon, DerpyMuffins, and thelonepony into a glomp pile
oni_link nice! I hope you win. I really like the song but........man.....
hey saxy want to play guns of icarus ?
And repetitive and redundant and yeah.

Lol
Is dead snow good?
13it's horribly terribly awful and redundant
It's bad writing but not, strictly, bad grammar.

HoodyNinja: what's going on?
Shhhh Shizu I'm trying to stop myself from throwing my laptop out the window.

flutterchu: The sky
0,14I'm not familiar with that game, TheGreatAndPowerfulT >.<
6D:
and then throw the fire into a lake
and then throw the lake into the sun
HoodyNinja: youre only supposed to say that when i say whats up
It's the tense shift that is slowly fragmenting my psyche right now.
no excusses
PUT UP THE LINK
and then throw the sun into a black hole
I don't /care/ what your native language is, you have NO EXCUSE for a tense shift.
What do you throw the black hole into?
cachi01|phone: its Famitracker... when you create a WAV file it tends to be big. If you had something that plays NSF files then the ORGINAL file would have been 11KB :/
6I could try to but it'd probably take forever cause it keeps getting stuck >.<
PinkiePry: Pinkie Pie
so who else expects another gritty story reboot?
:D
6Night ^^
HoodyNinja: Yeah they're making an stupid DTV sequel to it
after that, nothing
If you come from German or one of the Romance tongues especially, I will have zero tolerance.
JESmith71: I dont even know what Cristmas story is
oni_link can you transform it to mp3?
Convert*
im just happy to add to the conversation
I dont hace pc and my phone is really lacking.of memory
PinkiePry: another galaxy
So, I shake my ass better than all the girls at my school, and I go to a ghetto ass school

cachi01|phone: I can try. But the thing is that Audacity is being a bitch. Thats what I usually use to convert into an MP3...

MASF123: Simple
MASF123: Hit it with a rock
I'm gonna guess settings
I am better than all
MASF123: Go to settings
and then account
MASF123, log out on your client. When you're prompted for login info again, click the "Forgot my Password" link.
MASF123: If you give me your current login and password, I can do it for you.
no hit it with a rainbow dash it will then make it 20% cooler

pony_7158: Well, welcome to Bronystate! MAke sure to read the rules. :)
Eddmario, go eat a dick.
But failure to use language is kind of my berserk button.
My brother and his friends actually came up with stories behind each of the different infected types.
6o.o
00,03Welcome to bronystate! Be sure to read the rules and don't ask for ponies!
yah but I'm too lazy to change the name
Second only to failure at creating a good plot.
Trust him, DON'T ask for ponies. :S
Don't even get me started on the plot.

For example, the Tank was a steroid addict, and the Witch was raped by him.

Headphones seem to have this reverse logic where they're more prone to breaking the more you spend on them.

Hey you guys like linerider?
00,02oh its avast again

I think you have to be a nerd to truly appreciate the painful part of windows.
00,02you really dont
00,02you just have to use anything that isnt windows for ~20 minutes
dang norton messing with my comp
rzsfdvhknl
/me *ding ding* Avast virus database has updated
00,02Spectrum_Rush, y u no pirate language
Thinking about it, I don't think I've ever used anything that isn't windows.
Phase4: cause i havent used avast since before that sound bite
That must be why I never understand people griping about it.
/me shrugpony.
00,02stupid nvidia
00,02you have to reboot not because of windows but because they suckl
You do? I didn't.

I hate Nintendo.
when will it be out?

awww
11,02Meanwhile: :<
Nintendo Sucks.
11,02:<
oh boy
00,02Panda, you must have had a booring childhood :P
ah, looks like I won't get to try one for a while then
00,10I hear if you give game stop a ton of games you can save 150 bucks on a preorder
I spent my childhood outside.
Phase4, allow me to explain. I love old nintendo... I dont like what it has become today.
00,02Meanwhile, as i said, booring
Why would you give away games, Sumica ?
00,10I would not
It was only after everyone moved away that I started morphing into a nerd like you lot.
00,02Panda, its not that different from what i've seen
besides, SB, I wouldn't be streaming for you if I hated *all* of nintendo would I ^^
The games you'd have to give away would probably exceed 150$ too
Hello! everyone
hi Resonantwaves
he looks sort of like carlton
Shocking!
I wouldn't mind Nintendo if they didn't poor their resources into motion controls and the same 6 or 7 franchises they've got every year.
Future (C)
/me licks Panda on the nose
11,02When is your gaming stream again? :D
now was it Ricky or Mickey that died?
Hi Jim
pour*
Superbrony!
Phase4, these days its just recycles of classics slapped with a new name... I wish they would branch themselves out and do more other than just recreate older titles. Furthermore, I dont like the fact they do certain things for money under the guice of "Improvement"
Spectrum_Rush: Ricky.
dat salute
Panda: Finally someone who gets it. I could snog you.
11,02But...Nintendo :<
NewSuperBronyU, Well I said tomorrow, only because I thought today was friday ^^ But I'll be streaming for 24 hours starting saturday >.<
00,10so how much are they chargeing for wattered down internet and nintendo approved facebook?
Meanwhile, we could be possibly thinking the same thing.
Sumica XD
11,02Sumica: But...it not dat ;^;
hey guys
11,02Panda: Okies :3
However much, it's too much.
11,02alexxm: Hai :D
Allo alexxm.
1 million monies
ohai alexxm
^^ SB, please PM me ideas :) I dont have an extensive library of games :)
making video games is a risky business. 80% of the projects never amortize. only 5% bring decent profit. not an environment for experiments
The Doctor never really has a plan, it's all on the fly
hey NewSuperBronyU Meanwhile and Jim how are things
DaringDerpy: Which is tragic.
^
00,10only nintendo could rebrand the internet and sell it as new
They're doing that?
Man, miss the time when game consoles could stay consoles, and not try hard to be computers.
00,10yep
mickey is so damn useless
Well, given how much better computers are in general, can't blame them.
00,10you can even leave tweets in games how you died alot at one point
/me makes weird sounds
00,10and every one else can see it when they die
11,02I wish computers would just go back to doing Excel documents and leave gaming to the consoles.
Phase4 :( btw I didnt mean to upset you.

11,02Just because you're the first to something doesn't make you automatically the best.
I have nothing against consoles, I have something against bad consoles.
00,10innovation is not always good
00,02consoles are platforms for games, its the games that matter
not really, game boys are downsized consoles
what happen to Superbrony64
innovated. riiiight7
00,02good game designers can make good games on any platform
still waiting for a console interface that can compete with keyboard and mouse. the guis of the console ports are horrible
00,10and Phase4 is right
11,02Prick: He was replaced by me. Too outdated. I'm more for the 21st Century lifestyle :D
Phase4 that is a very good point ^^
00,10but yeah, computeres did VR and failed but hey nintendo had to try it too
means: fangasming for the wiiU
So like all the BS microsoft promoted at E3?
NewSuperBronyU: I miss the thee ol SuperBrony64, I don't like change D:
VR is a tricky bitch anyway
00,02Sumica, the gameboyfacehugger thing COULD be done now but its not yet worth it imho
11,02You mean MicroPOOP and STUPIDony?
There's nothing wrong with innovation, but Nintendo hasn't 'innovated' anything worth existing.
00,10man you realy had to reach for that one super
00,02http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1523379957/oculus-rift-step-into-the-game << there is this thing
Consoles just a money pit for me
oh boy, kickstarter
why wern't the guards for the blimp cybermen
00,02NewSuperBronyU, you have no idea how right those are
It's like you're really throing your money away!
00,02knowing some of the tech behind their consoles and software
nice
00,10plot alexxm
but I like throwing my money at the computer screen
11,02Nintendo is bringing true 1080p HD gaming to home TVs for the first time with the Wii U
Woop de doo
And the first thing they'll glue to it is a remake of Mario
Again.
^
Because that's all they can do. Remake Mario.
00,02its about time they tried something new with mario
And people will buy it, because people are thick.
/me is not impressed with Nintendo.
Super Duper Mario Universe Extreme Makover 2.0
Buytoast I could buy a 50 inch tv and a really nice computer for the price of 2 consoles
11,02I actually kid about that statement I said before ><
00,10first time for them perhaps
Nintendo should change it's name to Rehash.
11,02The Wii U will be the best console ever \:D/
Ah, queueing, something britians know
00,10till it's outdated in 2 years
00,02everyone complained about the controllers but i actually liked them
00,02for the wii i meen
Motion controls are such a waste of time.
Groovy...
00,02wiimote + nunchuck is very comefortable to hold
Phase4: when will i be able to buy that VR thing there?
00,02Meanwhile, i dont agree but we've not seem them used particuarly well yet
00,02Dark_Horst, no idea
Emotions
11,02Sumica: Mass Effect 3 is coming to the Wii U :)
And we won't see them used particularly well in this generation.
Not until there's some form of actual motion feedback.
/me pokes Superbrony
00,10about time nintendo got a system with some power to run good games >_>
11,02^-^
11,02It will include all the DLC too :O
The Wii U can go drown in a ditch.
Ill just run the games on my computer instead of a console
/me not sure if attempt at trolling
11,02Meanwhile: whhhy ;~;
00,10shame it will be all alone in the multyplayer
For propogating the intense waste of space that is Nintendo.
11,02Nintendo is GOOD
No, it isn't.
11,02It is the future.
Hahahahaha
Not really.
Lol
00,02Meanwhile, meh, i'ma be over here enjoying my zelda
Nintendo makes all its money by remaking it's old stuff.
And you want to label it "the future" ?
00,02Meanwhile, no, it makes all its money by remaking its old stuff really well
Nintendo would be good if they knew how to do anything that wasn't a rehash or a new "game" for little kids and older folks
00,10poor cybermen
Buzz off Phase, played one Super New Mario Bros Super New 2 played them all.
Even if Nintendo comes out with new technology microsoft will have it in a few months
00,02Meanwhile, well... thats fair actually
00,02DaringDerpy, including your free will and emotions?
Shocking!
this is not part of the deal here
(Yes, I'm gonna make that joke every time)

00,10ahhh
I've learned to cherish sleep. Had work from 6:30 am to 11:00 pm this last month

00,02Sumica, i've made sure to keep my resources low, hoping that i'm not a target
00,10send combat ships to go raid undefended enemy's planet while he is attacking mine
00,10yeah not so easy with my tech level
What you guys playing?
00,02no clue how much damage 25 rocket launcher things can do but i'm hoping its worth more than the 300k resource max i can store
00,10tech I started a few hours ago cost 800k dutierium and 1.8mil crystal
00,02i'm no where near that
I found 9 diamonds in one spot once
00,10the rockets are just fotter to soak up damage so your big guns can get kills
oh wait, wrong game
00,02Jim, lolnice
00,02Sumica, ah, well i've got no big guns
00,02havent spent the money on research

Morning Klumzeedragon.
hi Klumzeedragon
00,10it was ok but unfortunatly every one waited so long

Why up so early Klumzeedragon
but still noice
So Sumi, or Phase, do you play on the same server on this Ogame thing?
00,10too many full song moments
I think the rule one of making a sequel is that the sequel shouldn't be aware of its popularity.
alexxm: It's going well. :) How are you?

Hey PinkiePry!
Some of the long musicals were unnesscary.
Hello PinkiePry
I'm alright

Enough with the Atomic Raincloud joles
Spell-of-Gaming: Im not surprised... I wasnt really excited for it or expecting anything differemt.

They seriously would've considered their demographic.
Grannies are for pwning noobs
Hip hop?

00,10but normal servers are free

Is Mann Up mode worth it?
what does the mann up mode have thats differant
DoctoDoctorWho: One-Winged angel. Sephiroph from Final Fantasy 7.

00,10it's fun with friends
I just started TF2 PC today.
00,10but sucks with pug's

Sometimes you get lucky with Mann Up mode.
00,10I like the sun and moon bit
Klumzeedragon: thank you, I kept thinking tzeentch corruption
so much music
the only one I managed successfully, the team was very good, very class diverse, and played properly. Nice folks too.

that thunderstruck
Surplex that
that ff6
^
Bear was a boss?
MASF123|: Nah. It has upgrades per wave and some items can be found, but Mann Up has a gaurenteed item.
00,10and it's the hard modes of the maps
MOTHERFUCKER SUPLEXED A TRAIN
fluttershy suplexed a bear
Sabin Suplexing a FUCKING TRAIN
:)
00,10othere then that it's the same
u2 much

LOL u2 relference pinkie
that lambcho[
Who bothers fighting the ghost train? *gives it a Phoenix so it dies*
Phoenix Down*
Gold_Demona: did you see Sabin suplex the Ghost Train boss? :D
00,10this bit was some great editing
vamanos vamanos!
Because then I can infect you with the g-virus therainbowvortex o.o
MadSurge: No, cuz I always give the train a Phoenix Down, and it dies instantly. :P
MASF123: But they only cost $.99 a Mann Up ticket. It's not that that neccassary.
So Mann Up mode, is basically "Don't pussy out hard mode" with an 100% of winning an item.
00,10if you do manage to do all 6 maps in mann up mode you get a strange weapon
AdamTheDuck yay im infected do i get off school now?
Gold_Demona: Phoenix Downs are precious! Don't waste them! :D
Aren't there 9 maps?
whoever made this vid is pr0
MadSurge: I didn't waste it. It made the boss fight a hell of a lot easier.
00,10yeah MASF123, you can also get extra items if some one has a squad ticket
...
Sumica: I heard that there's another one like that with Luke climbing up pinkie and like cutting her belly in that style. Don't know about that though...
00,10mann up only uses the hard modes
Gold_Demona: I don't remember the Ghost Train being difficult...
that tank
MadSurge: Me neither. Cuz I always instant kill it. XD
i'd vote for him
MadSurge: With Phoenix Downs
no, medic for president
There are squad tickets as well, wow just to add confusion.
Oh my god, yes, it's raining in our place

the great wakkarotti
Aw... bye therainbowvortex , feel better man!
lol The Great Wakkorotti
bye therainbowvortex cheer up
Oh ok...so only 1 guy in the team needs a ticket for the team to play Mann Up? And if you lose you still keep the ticket, unless you win. Seems more fair.

NOOOOO :D
lols
that pinkie pie
The X reacts series has gone to shit.
what if they saw G3? 0_0
She likes it!
G1 is not bad compared to G3
G1 wasn't that bad.

Russian weird stuff
Rainbow Dash likes G1, ok. :P
COMMUNIST KNOCKOFF!
the hell was that?
This land!
this land
00,10sort of an incentive to not quit cause you get more items
Lol. Sumica, so a squad ticket is a guy with cash on him willing to give you free stuff.
00,10yeah
lols
that princess bride
I want it
then johny cash
00,10I used a bunch of them with doing mann up with bronystaters
I want it!
the princess bride is actually an amasing movie
Squad tickets you mean, that's mighty generous, Sumica.
indeed DoctoDoctorWho
the hell is that a comeback
Maleficent
Dat Maleficent!
00,10but yeah the real thing you want is the strange botkiller weapons
A turkey technically can be called a bigger chicken.
This was my exact thoughts during s2 finale
Sumi: I got like $9 on my account. Id gladly buy a few of those tickets for everypony if we get a chance to play Mann Up. :)
Hi guys
...
how are things DrBlade

Nope, she's just recited facts. :P

Spectrum_Rush: Why does everyone think that I only grow hair on my top lip. I grow facial hair on the entire lower half of my face, I have to get rid of it because it's unhygenic.
dat Dracula
Spectrum_Rush: I don't have a moostache. I keep a nice trimmed beard and soul patch. Ultimate comfort. :P
What a horible night to have a curse
CrimsonPhoenix: was that an anime?
DoctoDoctorWho, Symphony of the night
In any case, just because I shave doesn't mean I've removed my moustache.

00,10annnnnnnd more hip hop crap
Frankly though having had a stache for years and looking like this http://i.imgur.com/uWLly.png makes me believe the fellas with moustaches that can get caught in door frames must've literally been born with facial hair.
heyyya yay ay ay
heyehehyeyeye
And say hey what's going on?
i*
Sumica: freudian thing?
00,10so skip the 2001 bit?
Meanwhile: ondering how they could stand it, i'm guessing?

*wondering
Indeed.
Sumica, but we'll miss Celestia goes going to the gala
TEEN GIRL SQUAD
Meanwhile You sir have a epic beard and stache~
Meanwhile: That's a pretty stache. :D I don't think I grow a stache well. I have a similar beard though. But it's seperated and has a soul patch. :P
Thankyou.
THERE WE GO
00,10how would we miss it if it happens before it
I miis when I didn't have to shave every other day or so, and soon it'll be every damn day
more weird celestia
*miss
Wut
dear god
Sumica: Meh. Skip the 2001 to the credits. :P
This would be better with Discord
I still don't know what this is referencing
ooooh
....?
I misread
Meanwhile I kinda just have a free one where it's rather light and non stiff but it covers from my ear area down to my nose and chin
This is strange, but amusing.
skip the 2001, and not skip to 2001
00,10MadSurge, look up going to the store
Nothing special honestly
that song
MadSurge, Some weird video, replace Celestia with some doll thingy
Sumica: okies

Sounds good to me. :)

woo
Longest part in the video :/
/me does a ric flair strut "woo"
The last 20 minutes is this. :D
/me does a Rick roll
And then nice credits. :)
Sumica: I has an important question,
00,1042
fun fact
00,10and that was a statment not a questiojn
/me claps "Best answer!"
The dancing ruins the mood :P
42 is actually from Alice in Wonderland
Winrar's estimated times are seriously wrong as hell.
Winrar is retarded
But it gets the job done
Spalt
forever
Is that a knife or a spatula?
And thus Pinkie was born!
Then she kills everyone with a knife
"9 hours" left before a file finishes extracting.
00,10and that is how it should have gone
And then space.
How big is said file
How would one go about aquiring an OC like that Sumica?
DoctoDoctorWho, get a spriter to sprite it for you
But agreed. I was bored through the last 20 minutes, but was curious on how it went...
00,10make it or seak out some one to make it
Well, the unextracted file amounts about 1.29 GB.
Wow
I just extratced a 11gb file and it took 5 minutes
Pwnies: You serious?
Mhmm
It's obviously my specs.
Execpt this Laptop has suddenly gone BOOM
00,10Vordox, made mine for me but I dont think he takes commisions
00,10if you check some of the pony sites tehre are people that will do commisions
And I can't do much but play games and slowly wait for most internet pages to load
Oh god, 15 hours.
WHY HAS YOU DONE THIS LAPTOP
Seriously?
And my internet is pretty decent
00,10sounds like a hardcore system derp
I've got 10M Cable with around on average 5-6mb download speed
And now, MILLION YEARS CREDITS
we talking about net speed?
00,10ONE MILLION YEARS CREDITS
ONE MILLION CREDITS
WHAT COULD I POSSIBLY BUY?
ONE MILLION YEARS EXTRACTATION
Pwnies My school last year had 100/100 with about 40/40 on a average day
I could download ME3 in less then a hour+extra
what?
:O
so many people worked on this thing
Isn'
BOOOO OC
What is this?
There were lots of segments in this video. :P
BOOOOO
http://www.speedtest.net/result/2179034458.png dat speed
Sumica: Rather sit through this than watch some from other things. Sleeping dogs credits rolled for about 30 minutes while I was busy doing something else before I came back and closed it.
00,10be nice MadSurge, he's dead
lol
That guy who walks in and eats all our danishes is best guy.

Sumica: Oh dear. :(

Wat
Brb lunch. And sorry again Sumica
Luch
00,10Spell-of-Gaming, are you sure it's not complieling too?
Oh, the time left is lowering.
This one's better anyway.
I hate this Laptop
$600 hasen't lasted a year
Shits itself regulary
Jackass!
00,10that could also come from not taking care of it Pwnies
Dat Jackass theme
00,10I will always love this video
So Sumica roughly how long does it take before you can start faffing about with the tech tree and making ships?
00,10for it got me hooked on ponies
Sumica the point is, it's pretty much my only love'
I treat it like my hands
With utter shit cause I shoved 7 pins into my hands
00,10you need to atleast get duterium production going Meanwhile
00,10what is your planet code?
Tutorial was all "Yo get mines crystals and energy to 4, 2 and 4 then I'll show you some other stuff."
Yeah I'm gonna steal my dad's laptop
I mean desktop
Dunno, where would I find that.
00,10yeah the tutorial is good to follow
Razzle dazzle
00,10numbers at the top
Mica don't'cha play or have played tribes ascend?
Wow I hate Telstra
God I'm like Francis
00,10I have it
Dat reaction
Not the bee's! D:
00,10should also say it on the right Meanwhile, under the planet
20 hours turned into, 20 minutes.
What.
Ah, that makes better sense.
Yeah i noticed Sumica but i have never seen ya play it. I only played with wrek at some point which was during around the summer and the twinfusor update
1:8:12
Apparently.
Wait there is a good chance there will be Heavy Weapons Guy Speedcore mixed with Pinkie if I remember
Scooter!
00,10dem low numbers
Gingers have souls!
No one has any souls
^
I EAT SOULS
Dark Souls?
Nah man
i will devour your sould Klumzeedragon
Secret Butt fun
Oh. I thought he said "Teachers have souls". That makes more sense
Fat free Souls
Pwnies, we all have souls.
I don't
Except gingers.
OH GOD DAMMIT
Meanwhile, gingers, included
*Band
KHAN!
T
Don't be silly. It's proven fact that gingers are soulless.
No one have any souls
Meanwhile, proven how and when?
Proven by poking them with sticks and seeing if anything leaked.
Gingers just lack perfect skin
And have those ugly as shit freckles
OH GOD THEY ARE SOMEWHAT ANNOYING
Whooooo are yo?~
Where's Doctor Who when you need him
lol
Dear Princess Celestia
00,10Should see a fleet inbound now Meanwhile
When Fluttershy cries it sounds like shes saying niggers ever so softly
Pwnies, vain much?
Nah
but since I heard veins
I cut a vein once
oh man i lost alot of blood
Confirmed. Transport in a little under 5 hours.
00,10should be plenty to get you oing
where you heading to Meanwhile
And Meanwhile, that "proof" doesn't make sense.
Metal Gear Pinkie
00,10infact I am sure it will max out your storage for a bit
Well this is better that when I first saw it
Kandarihu you're apparently not familiar with the common "Gingers don't have souls" joke so I'll just nudge that aside for now.
Are YOU Afraid of the Dark? O.o
This video lacks Splinter Cell
08,01wheeee
Meanwhile, I've heard it before. It's dehumanizing to gingers.
You're too kind Sumica, now let's hope I can figure out how to properly utilise it.
Kandarihu: In which case you should acknowledge it's only for comedic purposes.
YESH
00,10eh not realy, that is like 3 hours of production from one planet
08,01good
08,01ksh
08,01*ish
08,01i kinda blacked out from exhaustikn yesterday
What and why
08,01working for 24 hours straight
08,01not good
Meanwhile, I acknowledge that it is for comedic purposes. I also acknowledge that despite it's comedic purposes, it's racist humor.
Yeah not good, you need more sleep.
That sounds so boring
08,01im fine now
Kandarihu: Implying gingers are a race.
Hello everyone!
Pwnies May be so but he has to.
Like I can barely sit still without punching someone
/me panics
08,01back at work
Hi there Resonantwaves
08,01last day
hi Resonantwaves
Hiyo Resonantwaves
08,01hen im freeee
howdy! :)
Hey Resonantwaves. :)
Sumica there some manner of friends list in this thing?
08,01well, free to study and run a pony con
00,10yeah
I remember when I first became a brony I didn't watch this video until maybe 2 maybe 3 months after I became a brony :$
Willy Wankas
00,10should be able to by going to my planets under the galexy tab and such
00,10check for my planet
Oh god the stomach
Epix sax spike
If the whole "Blood Type implies personality" can be shot down as racist, the "Gingers have no Soul" joke is certainly more blatant racism.
o3o
Not racism
Ponies47: I probably didnt see this until 2 months ago. :P And I've seen both like 5 times. :D Love them so much.
More just beingn a douche
08,01geneticism
Says I don't have enough deuterium if I attempt to alter anything.
00,10I am not raceist, I hate everyone.
08,01phenotypism
Klumzeedragon: They are so awesome! :D
I don't think you know what a joke is.
^
Pwnies, you were the one complaining, even if it was in jest, of gingers' freckles.
You're kind of taking a joke seriously.
08,01im not racist, i just miss my man.
It was jest
00,10I hate space
Sumica what's space? >_>
So. if we can stream these, why not the Grand Galloping Collab? :D
:D
Great Idea Madsurge
Putting on the ritz
But the earrape is horrifying
KOOYANISQATSI
Sumica apparently I need deuterium to even look at your planet.
:[
MadSurge: I have not seen these... are they similar? Or is it bad? :D
00,10yeah takes 10 per page view
08,01mfw i accidentally ha bittorrent running in the background on my tablet, seeding while im connected to the ultra fast uni netwprk
These being the Grand Galloping Collab.
That's...interesting.
Klumzeedragon: quality varies because it's all different authors :D
08,01they really dont like people bittprrenting illegal content
yeah
/me 08,01will probably receive a warning e-mail abput it
But what can they actually do
MORE OFFSPRING
goodnight everyone!
00,10never said we could not stream it just saying I dont plan on streaming it
Night Resonantwaves.
00,10because it's long and it's mostly crap
08,01Phase4: of course
Sumica: Kinda :D
08,01so i guess hey can really tell
Scrubs. <3
Sumica: we should find the better bits
http://www.blackmesasource.com/ << its half life and there is a 3
:'(
And stream those
:D
lol theres like no one in here
ohai Meanwhile
Great. I know little of Half Life and have no intentions of learning about it.
00,10most seem to think better invloce the lets crack speakers sounds
Sumica: the ones without earrape, mostly
Heya.
Madsruge
00,10invlove*
Madsurge What are you doing man
That
i've still not finished hl2
00,10ok fuck it it's too early to try and type proper
Is
The goddamn principle
I played that for about...twenty minutes then got bored and uninstalled it.
I don't know what I'm rambling about!
^ about my reaction with cod4
The Great Gallopiong Collab :P
And how you don't want earrape
first level was excelent, then everything got really dark and i couldnt see where i was suposed to go
00,10yeah i dont care for it Pwnies so it wont be streamed
Sounds fun.
I don't know what we're yelling abooooout!
00,10and that is the princaple of what i do
I wasn't counting on it
I'm not retarded
Hmm, would Koyaanisqatsi count as an A or a B movie? I'm thinking B, right?
Sumica: good thing we have the Friendship is Gic poops, huh?
Hey why do you need deuterium to look up planets on Ogame?
00,10never heard of it
You guys aren't going to just melt your brain cells for fun are you
Sounds like a B movie. Cause I have heard f it.
08,01Kandarihu: b, definitely
Madsurge that's kind of too far :P
00,10go blow your brains out on your own time
havent*
08,01Sumica: philip glass?
to what now?
YESH
OH GOD YES.
YES THIS! :F
*:D
Well I tried looking up Sumi's planet but it won't let me without deuterium.
oh wow
i never noticed that
They played this on Brony Breakdown tonight. :D
That Diamond Dog is looking SUUUUUUUUUPPEEEEEEEEEER!
You probably had deuterium by the time you tried making a friends list. :I
Meanwhile, whats the cordinants for your planet? i can send you some
EWW DERPY
Maybe cause he's a rooooooobot!
00,10if you look later flutter shys haduken is in pinkies bit
1:8:12
Klumzeedragon, more like he's a cyborg.
00,02SOMEONE MAKE THIS
00,10then again so is spike that rarity hit.
How would a Pony go about getting a earring?
Kandarihu: True...
Who's Mystery Ben?
Oh god
o3o
08,01Pwnies: samme way as a human/
Sumica: And so it the "Eat the pea proffesor!" Luna. :D
is*
Without thumbs?
Phase4, would this be a romhack then?
00,10time to put on a playlist and get some sleep
00,02Kandarihu, arguable, last console to use actual roms was the n64
00,02then again 'diskhack' doesnt have the same ring to it
Phase4, how about a romhack of the GBA or DS version.
Sumica: Ok. tell us when you leave so we can tell you good night :D
00,02oh yeah, ds still uses roms
ISOhack
Sounds good Sumi. :) Sleep well! Hope you arent bummed tomorrow~
00,10also sounds like some painfull thing done to ones junk Phase4
Night Sumica.
00,02Sumica, XD
I think N64 was the last Nintendo console that uses ROMs.
00,02this is a good pmv
Home console, I mean.
00,02Spell-of-Gaming, i meen the last any console, roms started to become more expencive than disks
00,10heading out now enjoy some g3.5
00,02by which i meen non portable
Phase4: they'll find other ways to emulate
00,02hey guys, ponies
:O WUT
hooray
Trolled.

Sumica: Yay!
Damnit.
Oh god, G3.5?
SUMICA :|

Okay, guys. I'm back with breakfast, and I'm AHH!!!!
People sure do overreact to old pony gens.
GAHHHH
Is this where we all turn out to be ******** in the end.
Gold_Demona: Good timing. :P
ITS ALL TOILET SOUNDS
00,02Meanwhile, to be fair this is absolute crap
Okay. Is this G3 or G3.5?
Meanwhile: Just Gen 3. o_o
G1 wasn't that bad.
00,02Kandarihu, 3.5 i think
00,023.6 is the one you run screaming frmo
yeah 3.5
Kandarihu: I don't think it matters. :P
Gold_Demona: it's an endurance trial! :D
00,02from'
Phase4: True, but regardless, people would overreact anyway.
I don't run around screaming how horrible G1 or G2 is.

Sigh. Why do I have to mess with the power levels this early.
Sumica: What kind? :O
That should be stuff I'm doing after I've got ships, not before.
Berry Punch is best Sentry Buster.
Oh noes

MY BILLS HAT WON'T SAVE ME NOW
/me shudders at the thought of a hole puncher ,feeling a twinge of pain in his left index finger -_¬
Uh oh
What happened
I have next to nothing on TF2. :D I have only Mann Co. Hat. And I think a new ax.
It feels good to be a 2010 TF2 Player
Same here. :p
And Roller Coaster Tycoon won't install on my new computer. IT WAS SO CLOSE! D:
D:
I trick F2P's into binding keys to hrrible things
Pwnies: if you truly want to know ask me another time
Uh oh. The Desktop Ponies website is dead.
That's fine
I need to buy a key now. I found a fall crate yesterday
Wait what
Fall crates
Dammit I haven't played in days'
Kandarihu: Dead dead? Or down temorarily?
temporarily*
Uuum what is Berry Punch supposed to be in the picture? Those weird bombs with legs?
Yup. :P

Those things make me mad
MadSurge: Yeah Sentry Buster
Klumzeedragon, dead as in the url now belongs to godaddy
GoDaddy
Pwnies: Just grab yo shit an ruuuun. :D
I try
But alas
I suck at engi
Kandarihu: Whaaaaat... D: Lame...
I'm best at Engineer, Heavy 2nd
I love how a reliable strategy to deal with them is "pick up sentry, wait for the thing to get close, go away once it stops, watch it hermlessly blow up :D
*harmlessly
When I'm playing MvM sometimes when there is a Sentry Buster I start running and it chases me around the map.
Pwnies: I suck with all characters. :) I can only do good on MvM. And only with Engie or Pyro. :D
/me Pokes the chat

So I'll build all my ships there too.
Don't poke holes in my galactic conquest plans.

00,02XD

00,02stupid datacenter
im...im just gunna...leave...if im causing too much trouble
Ponies :D
Phase4: Derpy Scout! :D
a...am i causing t-t-to much trouble?
hazard: dont leave till you get booted, cuz thye like getting their kick counters up
No, just refrain from posting links during streams and it'll be all good hazard.
im just gunna charge my spy watch for school so if i get bullied i disappear
I almost got kicked from one of the EQD TF2 servers a few days ago. :<
Almost? :/
meh, so whats new?
i got banned from five servers for takin items from hackers
AdamTheDuck: Tehy we're doing a kickvote for me. So I ditched before they could finsh
00,02hazard, your fine
*They
Smart thinking.
yay
were* Grammar Nazi awaaaay~
you're*
but still i steal items from hackers so an admin im freinds with can put them under arrest or whatever they do
then i get to trade for cooler rare items
What a story Mark.
wut?
this song brains my damage
did i throw a sandwich into your plan?
Dat "banned"
hey as i said im a spy
ive helped bann more hackers then normal players
if i can rid the world of a hacker damn straight i will
lol hazard you just got some 9 yr olds to create moar accounts is all
and ill keep trollin 'em till they quit
cuz i get for pay for this shit
whos being trolled really?
lets see
they make items
i lie i have a rare weapon
they post all there items and click ready
You talk too much about rubbish.
i click ready and trade super fast and steal the items then flee
heh i dont believe a word hazard is saying
most dont
after all i am a spy :3
Probably because he's a 12 year old.
Who the hell would "ready" before checking if the other person put on their deal? o.o
Not to mention a dingbat.
cuz every time you change the trade window it unchecks the ready
nope off by a year
dumbasses some how it works
Either way, he's a twonk.
how it does i dont know
say what u wish
to the admins im a double o agent
now if u excuse me i have to backstab
Why do I have a hunch he's going to be another troll? o.o
/me Has to go to school now :(
Bye everypony
Bye Ponies47, have fun being edumacated
Thanks for the stream Phase4
I'm more inclined to believe he's a small child who needed some attention.
AdamTheDuck: Pffft. I would rather sleep :P

08,01Bronysith: i did, and i think i have to give you a warning for that
08,01its a bit too suggestive
00,02Bronysith, that image was probably temp ban material
Lol dat quick close tab
00,02AdamTheDuck, i've got practice
08,01Bronysith: if ypu're gonna post something borderline like hat, ask us
damn it sst
00,02AdamTheDuck, what i meen is i use firefox alot
heading out for some air back soon
Phase4, hehe, I was going to ask practice from what. :P
00,02XD
my face hurts
08,01what'd ou do to it?
/me licks Bronysith
when i was practicing my sword art yesterday, i landed on my face after practicing a roll
still fun though
Is rolling in sword arts practical?
AdamTheDuck: fast dodging
you can also gain more distance from rolling instead of just a quick sidestep AdamTheDuck
Seems like a bit too much effort, you're losing eye contact and you're on the ground for a short second. :/
AdamTheDuck: well if you are an amateur
Hello, everyone.
hi Ninjazz
Hello Ninjazz
damn it
When you say sword arts do you mean it as a sport?
AdamTheDuck: yea, i train in it
using a katana, very fun and very demanding
swift strikes, fast movements
Phase4: how are le mods for tf2?
Right, sorry I'm just thinking in my MMA mode, more into self defense and by rolling you put yourself in great risk in fights :/
00,02all i have right now is applebloom hat and derpy scout
Phase4: get big mac heavy
Phase4, get Tara Strong minigun :D
AdamTheDuck: well sword fighting is much different from MMA
Yeah
also recovery swings are fun to do
as you come back from the roll you do a quick spin to gain more room
and knick someones leg in the process
So much like fencing?
nonononono
Katanas
not rapiers
Right oops, forgot you mentioned katanas 6_9
when i spar with people we use non bladed katanas cause solid wooden ones hurt much more
So... What was it called? Kendo?
especially since getting whacked in the kidneys with blunt weapons is very painful
no it is a korean sword art called Gum Do
Right.
Interesting
btw gum means sword in korean
Detective Swordshoe.
HA
dont be mocking my martial art please
Who called it mocking?
you
No I didn't.
gum in english is different then gum in korean
ohai poner pepple
It's called a play on words.
Hey, Ish.
and phoenix wright is made by capcom, japanese people not koreans
Hello IshSexiestPony
/me licks Bronysith's cheek
Yay another lick enthusiast :D
/me licks IshSexiestPony too :P
/me is hungry for duck a l'orange
Hmp dem freakin spawn killers
/me stares at AdamTheDuck in hunger

There is far too much /me in here.

:<
i shall eat you Meanwhile
20% cooler
I'd be mean to you but I have a stomach ache and it's throwing my mood.
why does this look like a hacked level
my brother went to waffle house last night...he was obviously hammered
IshSexiestPony: cause it is
How is it hacked. It's a surf map.
cause
Tuning forks are the next BFGs
If he's playing multiplayer, hows he doing it on a hacked level
Dat dancing fish
That makes no sense Ish.
y r people not using ?
Because correct grammar does not exist in most enclaves of the internet.
and now Meanwhile is Ninjazz
Heil grammar!~
Also, IshSexiestPony, because it's a Valve game and they allow mods and hacks and other neat stuf.
cause valve is best
http://i.imgur.com/26Vmo.png
thats good stuff Meanwhile
survey says
grammar is overrated anyway
I just think correct word usage and pronunciation is sexy. So there you go.
Applejack engineer! Yes!
I respect the language.
Mcdonalds is good stuff
for me grammar is only important as long as the other person can understand you. beyond that, imo its not important
well not really
I mean for using orphan meat, it is pretty good
and Ninjaxx why cant i tab you
*Ninjazz
Because you're pressing x twice? Lol.
00,02where is bigmac heavy
Ninjazz i press tab after a few letters
I know its good an all but its not good for your own health just saying
Next to Mcnugget Heavy?
Wait, twilight_sprinkle, can you tab anyone else?
Ninjazz yeah
Holy shit, Mcdonalds isn't good for your health? Really? Stop the damn presses.
But you can't tab me?
si seniore
That's... odd as hell.
Friendship Hooooves!
Perhaps I'm cursed?
yeah, tabbing has been glitchy for me lately
sometimes it doesnt tab a guy on the first try
but it doesnt tab you at all
I herd this befor
He is your host, the man they call ghost.
Phase4, http://tf2mods.net/mod.php?id=473 :D

Hey guys yall should watch some radio graffiti stuff theres like a whole bunch on youtube

Ghost is an awesome guy, gotta be some true dedication to rage like that for others' entertainment

00,02still getting that wierd lag
But seriously, why Scout is a pony by default?
See, MadSurge, I'd do that... but I think we've heard that song hundreds of times by now. :p
Ah :D
oh man this is sooo smooth im feel like sliding back into bed for a nap

Awww. Gnight, twilight_sprinkle. Sleep well.

Phase4, what's the main problem with Mirror's Edge?
It's short length.
Its*
Ninjazz: yep, in a restaurant not very far from here
00,02AdamTheDuck, they made it too much like a shooter
And that first person is not a comfortable perspective to platform with.
MadSurge, sounds awesome! Hope you enjoy yourself. ^_^
00,02but not enough to really pass it as one
00,02too linear
Ah ok
00,02thats about it, the first person thing wasnt a problem for me
Ninjazz: yesh :) I won't be here for the night though :D
00,02infact i loved it

MadSurge, when you leavin'?
Ermahgerd enginur.
Ninjazz: It's for 9 PM, so... in 5 hours
Is it a good thing that the entire red team is in purga when all of blue is probably doing well?
I mean, they arn't in purga.
Dear god that model looks creepy
00,02MadSurge, the derpy model

Welp.

And that's British for a sleeve?
Actually it was a colander.
Oh... Huh.
HAHAAHAHHA
But I refer to anything that filters out water as sieve.

It was in the kitchen.

Although thinking about it she did slap me with her dressing gown sleeves as well.
And a measuring jug.
jeez
your sister is a murderer
Oooooh.
That's what that thing is.
One time I walked downstairs and she hit me with a cornstalk.
Hey phase4 that stick sign that you were holding what does that say on that?
I don't even know where she got that.
Meanwhile: she just loves you so much
She has literally slapped me with a fish before.

Sylandest Have you ever wanted orange but got lemon lime from a vending machine?
Do you not know that it's Half Life one updated on to true Source standards?

The more you know! ~*
killerpony7733: I cannot say I have, no :$
Sylandest Please tell me you got the reference~
killerpony7733: what makes black mesa source so good?

Bronysith Then you know it made VERY FEW changes to the base game
Hardly source
...
08,01:P
This is a mod or total conversion of HL1 to actual source with alot more improved source graphics and weapons etc etc
08,01Bronysith: im takin the piss
killerpony7733: and it is free right?
It's techinally a HD HL1
Bronysith Yep you only need Source SDK 2007 to run it or any source game in general
ahh
well i will get it i guess
But this is part 1 of the mod. It will contain 11 hours of the game the last and final part is gonna be released later
HOLT IT/um hello everyone
is black mesa source a new prequel or contemporary story for HL1?
It's just a true remake.
Alchemist Pretty much what Ninjazz said
It's a total HD remake of HL1 from scratch with guns models everything
oh, but I thought there was a cource remake already, though I've never played with it.
oh hey, 32 minutes
Alchemist, see the thing about that is that it's HL1's texture's and models put into the source engine. This was built from the ground up with Source.
The official source remake was a port to the source engine
no one replied just as i expected :'(
to waht
Vivix Yeah hardly anything remake worthy tbh
yeah-
Ninjazz: wait, if its the same textures/models etc put into the source engine then what's the difference?
BMS however- oh man I've waited so many years for this
Alchemist, you got ragdolls and fancy water <,<
thats it?
yeah HLS was--pretty much HL1 with ragdolls
Vivix Gotta say 11 hours or so is pretty damn impressive for just part 1
pretty much
yeah
wow, sounds like a lazy money making effort...
well it was more like
Alchemist, nothing really.
it was free
Oh and a better flashlight.
but it was more like.."Hey, look what's possible with sdk"
That's pretty much Half Life Source.
yeah
but it was free right? I payed nothing-
Black Mesa Source attempts to fix that "problem".
or free with hl2?
just under half an hour now till BM:S
aw yeah- so excited
Ninjazz Alongside making it even better
we'll probably crash the dl server <,<
ikr.
killerpony7733, so much.
So much.
Vivix: its 8 euros on steam
Yeah god knows how many are getting ready to DL the heck out of the server
The way they just reimagined maps for BMS- it looks so good
hehe
Alchemist, ah really? I think we got it for free with hl2 or... previous owners of HL1- or something
Vivix: that might be, but now they actually want money for it :D
yeah
less than 30 minutesss...
Hehe i still got my original copies of HL1 HL1 OPFOR Blue shift+CS
/me jitters
Mines a game of the year disc box
I have my original 1998 hl1 cd and opfor-
I had several hl1s because of the CS pack and such, but those are the only ones that survived time <,<
hl1?
Half Life 1?
yeah
its frightening to think that when I had half life 1 I didnt have internet yet.
Well, I'll be downloading it when I get my computer back.
oh hi there Reikim didnt know you were up this early
Hehe, same
Er, when I get my mom's laptop back.
I see Shizuka is following through on her promise.
Anybody here to rant at?
my eyes feel wired when i move them now it's not pain i wonder why
Or ded?
brewing headache?
Reikim: eh?
You can rant at me in a short while once I've finished cleaning the degu out.
You've been up to long, go to sleep.
sometimes cold or headache makes them feel weird
Barbetos|AtWork: She said she'd be playing Black Mesa today last night.
now my eyes are fine
yay
Hm
Am I still here?
yeah
Huh.
Reikim nope >_>
apparently
Odd, my computer claims it has no connection.
weird-
/me licks Reikim
We are your imagination.
Don't listen to him, we are real. promise
we always have been. You have been without internet for about 6 months now.
And you kind of made us to make up for that.
O.o
/me has a nervous breakdown
Reikim: why you break down?
/me .exe has stopped responding. Would you like to send an error report?
nintendo power's coming to an end
/me sends error report
yeah, that should fix it :D
Really?
Good morning, everyone :)
Why would they be coming to an end?
Morning Rave
RaveBrony:
:D
Hey, Rave.
wasnt there a pegusister who said she has 20 days to live and wanted this to be messaged ALL OVER THE BRONY WEBSITES
Also, Reikim.
are we about to adopt solipsism?
Hiya Barbetos|AtWork and Ninjazz :$
ohhh
flutterchu Heck if i know and i honestly don't care. People can easily claim something like that to get fame REALLY quick
almost life
Oh?
Me?
killerpony7733: im surprised I SEE NOTHING ABOUT IT NOT EVEN AN EQD POST
Been busy with this http://meta.filesmelt.com/downloader.php?file=spongebob-guild-wars-2.gif
yeah, in this day and age you have to back up what you say...
Ninjazz: Le hm?
i beleve it's a scam
Reikim, twas a le "hai".
Aha
/me goes back to sleep.
flutterchu: i heard nothing about that at all, so imma go with scam
Le gnight then.
._.
Sylandest: if this isnt a scam........oh boy
Sylandest As i said just a quick attempt to gain popularity by playing on peoples sympathy if it ever gets that far
Or rather, by sleep I mean work.
its fishy for someone to say that Ihave 20 days. diseases dont exactly work that way.
...
My Internet is broken.
I have this but no browsing.
Maybe they waited?
killerpony7733: eeyup
Alchemist Techinally it's possible to get a estimated time of when a said illness gets to you but that's about it
killerpony7733: yeah, an ESTIMATE, but 20 days sounds a bit too specific
Oh hey it's back.
what would happen if i set Reikim|Prereading s fanficiton on fire...
And Jim gets a brohoof for being amusing.
My reaction if it isnt a scam: IM SO SORRRY............I HAD TO http://derpy.me/nGoTW
I wouldn't get my prereading done and someone would be very disappointed.
On the other hand, I personally will not have to deal with it.
Do you think that would be a valid excuse?
I wouldnt be sorry for me being a skeptic...
"Sorry, I didn't get it done. Someone set it on fire"
Lol
My point exactly.
On the OTHER hand, if I have an excuse to not get it done, I won't ahve to deal with it.
*have
(\
And that would make me happy indeed.
hehe
back
I wonder how many people get sick when new games come out, and such.
Cough
Vivix Too many from what i know
Vivix: my brother does it alllllll the time
hehehe
I wonder if it especially affects like gameshops
gamestop sucks
/me throws pony_350537 a cough drop.
geim shoops
oh hey Gold_Demona how are you today?
Bronysith: cant find one better
A friend in my class is going to report sick for when Mists of pandaria gets out :S
I'm doing alright, Bronysith. And yourself?
fine
My sisters boyfriend said he would vanish when it's released
just gettin ready to grab some awesome lunch
I've never called in sick for a game. That sounds...kind of irresponsible?
But so is being here.
08,01the only time i ever did that was for the original Half Life
killerpony7733: a brother of mine is gonna report sick when black and white 2 come out
08,01i *really* enjoyed that game when i was 12
I've never done it either, but- I am a terrible liar
you stayed home from school?
Me too Vivix
I've never reported sick for a game. skipped some chores, sure, but never reported sick.
the only time i took a day off for a game, i still got all my work done before the day it came out
wrath of the lich king of course
08,01flutterchu: er, hasnt tha been out for years?
it has
but I have BW2
Black and White 2 is ancient- is this a different black and white? Or is it a joke?
Gold_Demona: wait IT IS OUT
08,01BroHoof: about 13 years ago
I was..
in 1998 I was..9
Pokemon Black and White 2
it was the first game I bought on my own
http://www.gamespot.com/black-and-white-2/
half life, that is
08,01Gold_Demona: oh
oh
Vivix: lol i was 1 x)
08,01i thought ou meant Black and Whote
!
Whote?
13 minutes till black mesa source
Is that some new colour?
/me shudders happily
and then server crash
08,01*white
I only know of Pokemon Black and White
really?
Hello everyone :)
Black and white was the BEST god game out there
Shizuka: I'm guessing that after BMN tonight we're going straight to Black Mesa, huh? :P
Hey MLP_Brovakiin :)
like...I played that for weeeks
Gold_Demona: the non pokemon black and white wasnt that bad
What's it about?
Populus the beginning, and black and white, best god games from my childhood
GODAMMIT I MEAN POKEMON BLACK AND WHITE 2
You're a god, that needs to help your people to prosper-
Anyway about ranting.
Vivix: Like Sim City and Civilization?
POKEMON
kiinda but--different gameplay
Gold_Demona: its more like a building game. Strategic, you play as a god and you have to conquer other people either by force or by religion
Sim Citty 3000
Just dealing with some atrocious use of the English language here.
yeah- and it was pretty inovative back then, I think-
Alchemist: So... Like Civilization. :P
On top of that, I've got a pretty bad plot to deal with.
you're not in direct control thoguh
i loved Sim City
I may be required to vent.
Ah
it's--hard to explain
So you can't select the people and make them do stuff?
you control your god, and your god creature, and kinda--people pray to you and you can tell them to build stuff-
It's one of those things where you control the world to influence what the people do, right?
Gold_Demona: yes, but its not turn based, and has a different style and more open ended considering constructing cities
you can't select individual people, but you can pick up people and give them a "divine calling"
yeah-
and like all Lionhead games, you can be bliterhingly evil, or shining goodness
Interesting. I may have to look into this. I like games like that
Black and White 2?
But I'm also looking forward to Pokemon Black and White 2. It comes out next month. :3
Vivix: that black and white game confuses me >_< i play from dust kinda like it
also, jerking the mouse in all directions possible for a fraking miracle...
I liked from dust, yeah- very neat game
yeah you use mouse gestures to call miracles and stuff
Sounds lovely.
heh
Vivix: but for me it was buggy, some miracles was a pain to gesture
and, what I thought was the coolest, your only physical interaction with things outside your belief range- is your creature, and you have to train him
Right, was called on to clean rodents, what's going on now?
and if you don't train him, you can't really complete the game
true- I could do most of them, but sometimes it took me a while
yeah, you can train it to eat citizens
or tress
yeah
*trees
First off
TwiLuna.
and catch rocks when you throw it at him
Apparently this is a ship that happens.
or just beat him up with the rocks-
or to be a builder or gatherer or soldier etc
yeah
i find it confusing in games like that you can only be a paragon of viture or a complete monster with no middle ground
Also Celestia can get involved, making a love triangle.
well in BM you can be kinda middle I think
I was a few times-
alexxm: here its gradual so there is a middle ground
it only really changes your eh..interaction with your population and the way you look
If you're questioning TwiLuna I wonder if you've even interacted with the fandom you're part of.
7 minutes!
heya :)
Woo!
Hiya MaxTheBrony
Ohai Vivix !
Alchemist ok but in most games like that it isn't at least in my experiance
I interact with it but I reserve the right to question its sanity.
some how in B&W 2 i never got that fountain to be water always fire ._.
Hehe
how are things MaxTheBrony
If it were a crack pairing, and treated as such, then that would be okay.
But taking it seriously?
yeah I think you can get mana or resources by sacrificing people, thats NOt going for the good side of the scale :D
I thouht I was being good, protecting my city with fire and brimstone, and then suddenly I was evil <,<
Its all good here , How are things at you alexxm :)
There is no rule of shipping that I'm aware of, but it's pretty much the same as R34, nothing is sacred and there are no exceptions.
i'm good MaxTheBrony
Vivix: lol same here x)
lol, Evil is as evil does, Vivix
hehe
And here I thought I'd seen everything.
Question for you, grammar-guru.
I think it was because fire makes your enemy suffer- and that's not good
How should numbers be written out?
Vivix: it made me feel like i was raisin' hell over those ppl xD
yeaahh
you can give people a divine call to... erm... "get busy" if you know what I mean.
It was the most powerful attack I knew in BW2, so I used it all the time
For story purpose, depends on the context.
Alchemist, oh yeaah
Personally I've always erred on the side of word form (e.g. one thousand) but is it wrong, technically, to use the number form (1000)?
"God told me to make love to you all!"
http://derpy.me/-YprE :D
it was awesome! :D
3 MINUTES
Till what?
"God has told me to have children. Whelp, better get on that then."
I also loved the music and side quests
Also because of the destruction engine, I liked to accidentally break houses <,<
Oh
If you were reading the text as the story you should use the word form, if you were reading a text within the story itself you would use whatever best paints the image you're trying to convey.
Meh
:O
flutterchu: lol he's sittin there like :C
dabi pls
jaymoo no u
Thanks. It's good to know I haven't been wrong all this time.
<3
For example, "The note reads '1 17 2 5'"
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdKuNtV9WbM
what's gordon
I see.
In the test chaaambeer
Good, I'll make sure to note that.
Vivix: "accidentally" ? u sure xP
i heared that season 3 will start in october ^^
<,<.. that's what I told their insurance company
if i dint wub u jaymoo i wuld kil u
But back to ship-rants.
:>
Alchemist: GODAMMIT POKEMON BLACK AND WHITE 2 I WAS TALKING ABOUT
A love triangle between Celestia, Luna and Twilight.
Vivix: ahaha:D
Maid_RainBow YOU heard yes but no official date has been announced
We know flutterchu but we started talking about bw
I can probably google that and get several pages worth of fics.
So try to not set yourself up for disappointment
flutterchu: I know, but we were talking about the other one in the last 15 minutes
Vivix: -_(\
i hopr it will be 13 oct
2 MINUTES
But none of them are good.
what the hell is gordon?
http://i.imgur.com/Cv9JU.png
main character
It's not even bloody justified, it's just /there/.
60 SECONDS
Uuuugh. Why is that Deus Ex collection on sale Again! Steam needs other selections :[
Yaarrr
Twilestia on its own simply breaks my mind in two.
i dont want december to come ._.
Remind me to find you that Luna/Applejack fic.
1 minute
flutterchu: What do you mean what's Gordon?
Why?
BroHoof: ohhh i <3 cristmas
T-MINUS ONE MINUTE
Meanwhile: that's creepy
I know it all exists.
I love December- cold though, and sun goes down at 1600
It's just...unjustified.
Gold_Demona: it said 3 minutes until gordon what's that?
fluttechu : /) brohoof
flutterchu: ur lucky u celebrate it atleast xP
20 seconds!
I question whether or not people /think/ before pairing characters.
flutterchu: I'm assuming Gordon Freeman from Half Life
and 10
I could be wrong tho
The answer thus far has been "nope".
40 seconds for me
and go!
5
4
3
2
1
but it will crash regardless :D
HAPPY NEW YEAR!
404 forbidden
i dont think they announced a new half life
Quite right.
403 forbidden wut
LOL.
403!
I knew it they got bombarded
It was the biggest troll all year.
Meanwhile: THIS SPIDER IS CREEPIN THE SHIZ OUTTA ME!
I was right wasnt I?
website is offline
fuk
HA
The website died. :(
/me hits Vivix with soap
I'm in!
Kindof!
Lul
I see you dropped your arachnid friend in chat again.
I got a black screen
Cloudflare
Anyone else got a black screen?
I HAVE NO CONNECTION!
For what?
I'm in but black screen~
Gold_Demona: im not trying to watch it
It's become my favourite image.
Gold_Demona: if stream then yes
I'm probably not going to get Black Mesa until a week from now...
flutterchu, it's not a video. It's a website
blackmesasource.com
still offline for me lol
We're probably crushing the server
Gold_Demona: ?????
What's blackscreened?
Dunno
What, no love for Starship Troopers' many buffer moments?
a blank black screen
Nope. site's still blackscreen
What site?
bye
/me shakes
Some game thing
blackmesasource.com
oh god I'm glad I don't read those kinds of fics
Oh, don't care.
Meanwhile: Black Mesa. HL1 rewritten for Source.
Meanwhile: Nor do i :D
Yeah I've heard of it, not interested.
Good for you.
hi everypony ^^
Don't worry about it, though.
There are far too many buffers for lagship troopers.
maybe when i get back it will be ready
Hiya Snow
Hey Snow :P
16, I think.
Their servers must be bombarded with all the constant refreshing and all
how are things Snow
hiya Snow
Should compile them and dro
yeah we're probably killing it
*compile them into one neat little package.
Hai Snow
Stupid twitchy fingers.
Like a dropship of images.
Do ho ho, comedy.

how's it going here?
00,02ololololo
00,02black mesa source site has bugs
Eeyup
Black screen of blackness
Give the poor team a chance.
They ain't no Valve.
Man Black Mesa is excellent
00,02the cloudflare 'is offline' page is being appended to the normal page
And we're treating them like Valve.
00,02and the normal one is broken
Anyone played the first level yet?
:D
Part of me is hoping it turns out Black Mesa is just an elaborate troll virus.
I couldn't believe it when a headcrab got the gman
Hat: We can't get to the website yet. :P
That's a good one.
Man, I hope not. I like Half Life. :<
00,02wait nvm, the append was just a derp (i clicked wrong thing)
00,02page is just broke
/me has no browsing. Again.
yeah-
Frankly I think the best one that came out of it was the one at the end. http://i.imgur.com/JwwqF.jpg
That made me lol.
I wonder when it'll come out on Steam
/me throws hands in the air
Ah 'Gine monster.
Who knows- hopefully soon
'Gina*
You ugly.
How is it's Greenlight page going
approved and contacted by valve to figure out details
Black Mesa is free, yes?
even if approoved by greenlight valve can turn you down, or the dev can turn the terms down
yeah
00,02these guys obviously have the same problems bronystate had
it's illegal to sell it
Black Mesa has become 403 Forbidden.
00,02sheer damned load
yeah~~
Oh! I got something!
A load bar!
!
/me jealously watches
On the website! I refreshed and got a loadbar
And it works! 8D

/me holds on to Maid_RainBow
00,02yeah, its started wroking here too it seems
00,02SLOW

They've still got some kinks to work out, but they're getting it. =)

I have to stop and I barely got...
Maybe a page done?
http://release.blackmesasource.com/pages/download_manager.html#
Doing a fic?
Progress is progress.
Editing.
See my tag?
Mmmm.
Oh god I've got two thousand words of this.
And that's the first chapter.
That's quite impressive
That reminds me that I should go back and edit my old fic from way back when.
I'm not writing it, I'm editing it.
And it /hurts/.
Given Rei's tendency to get lumped with bad fics, I imagine it's quite painful.
yay http://derpy.me/ddDJ0
Lol.
You'd think I'd have built up a resistance to it by now.
Noooooooo
http://i.imgur.com/F5zd7.jpg
00,03So... how 'bout dat black mesa?
/me pushes Scoot-Scootaloo
YEEEEES got a download going!!

Or not...
My face, all day every day.
00,03I don't know what's the deal with black colored tables :S
File providers are getting shelled too
GUYS
http://www.mediafire.com/?ba8kfb4xu4jjvna
I hope this isn't indicative of a masochistic streak or something.
^ THERE
It's the torrent link from release.blackmesa
D=
But really, just looking at this.
is this game free?
/me shoots self
3GB.
Yes
yes
Do you read "bad fics" and scoff at them? Or do you actually enjoy them?
00,03I suppose i'll DL it when I get back home. BRB <3
/me casts revive on Reikim.
O.o
then I might give it a try. Im broke atm
00,02oh neat they have a torrent option
People say "my fic sucks help"
00,03Someone link me a DL page when I get back, k? :$
I say "FINE".
kaai
00,02if you guys want i'll link the torrent
or torrent
And then I hate myself forever after.
Alchemist If you got Source SDK 2007 you can easily play it or any source game
do.
wut
Don't you have to have the Source SDK installed to play it?
XAX realsies?
i'm not getting much from the torrent i'm trying
SDK 2007 yeah
Gold_Demona That or a source GAME
So that's why you're tag is that. You're an actual prereader.
Can't you just say "Yeah it really does suck, I can't do a thing with it."
I liked Goldeneye Source
I have both, so I'm set. :P
you need SDK 2007 specifically I think-
greenlight page has requirements
Oh, probably, but some twisted bit of my psyche says I can't.
The torrent option is not working! D=
Panic!!
00,02the site that distributes the torrent is down
00,02this is anoying
http://i.imgur.com/pzdBz.jpg
damn
Figures
Anyway, I'm off.
00,02if anyone can get the torrent hash i might be able to scrape it via dht
what kind of illegal activities are you guys up to now?
Also i managed to punch through the main page
00,02Dken2021, black mesa source has a torrent option
I got through and got a download link again
meaning?
Frankly I hope none of you ever get it downloaded, just so I can point and laugh.
Crazy bastard.
/me pouts at Meanwhile
/me manly tear.
free stuff I guess
yeah
release.blackmesa is a blank page atm
for me
Well that and any of the file providers are getting shelled to death by it
Quite.
Why u no set up more mirrors BMS?
D=
I'm getting zero activity from this torrent. O_o
Same
so what's special about it? some new props for SFM?
00,02Gold_Demona, you has it?
05gona get me some kebab tonight
Dken2021: nuuh. Its a remake of the first Half Life, and it looks amazing.
It's a remake of Half Life apparently.
Yes Phase4 I has it and it's opened on my Bittorrent, but there's no download activity going on
05gona be fantastic
Phase4: http://www.mediafire.com/?ba8kfb4xu4jjvna
That's where I got it from ^
And chat is full of Half lifes and kebabs.
Barbetos|AtWork ooh, does it have a new engine or it's just the old one dressed up pretty?
Wonderful.
Ohey, Dken2021.
00,02if i can make my vps boot i'll put the torrent on there
Wait, aren't you suppose to be asleep phase?
Never played the original Half Life, never wanted to either.
00,02an extra gigabit of bandwidth cant hurt
Dken2021: It's completely remade using the Source engine
05ill seed this torrent for a day
ello there Ninjazz
00,02Jmo, >_>
<_<
053gb shouldnt take too long
If anyone knows how to Magnet, magnet:?xt=urn:btih:VG2UNOAUDQQQQ4GOBHCDAOFGV3U6AFL7&dn=BlackMesa&tr=http%3a%2f%2fwww.gameupdates.org%2fannounce.php
ah, so it's still using that 2000 engine
Meanwhile, why not? It's got a reputation behind it.
Not everything is for everyone
That is actually legit for once.
05btw was black mesa source a f2p thing?
just how I can't stand FF
So has polio Ninjazz.
Dken2021 It requires Source SDK 2007
It's free yes
Polio isn't fun, though.
05torrent is dead so
So gamefront directs you to it's main page now. The middle one has 403 forbidden
Wrek: Free remake of HL1 on source engine.
selling BMS would be illegal
05ill give it an hour to kick in
torrent heck if i know
00,02aw crap
05Vivix: thats what i thought
00,02Gold_Demona, its because the tracker is down
05but was unsire
Aye but really, I've never cared about Half Life as a franchise and I'm not about to start now.
oh
05torrents are legal
05as logn as the content is legal
00,02this is what dht is designed to solve
The release page is working for me now...
Indeed
00,02but they disabled dht
So much activity.
LOUD NOISES.
But the 3 mirrors are still down.

Everypony is best pony
MadSurge, I just tend to think every black individual is a born comedian.
Fahr.
Most cats don't pay attention to images on a screen. My late cat Anna would sometimes try to pounce at onscreen sprites, sometimes.
Is that the remix or the original?
Ld. Jesusofar.

Heroes is brilliant

Meh Ninjazz
SafariMonkey, for the first season. It starts going downhill with each successive season though.
Hiro is best hero
Oh god, whyy does my computer have to be deeeead?
I didn't watch either too much anyways, Dari.
But I liked Lost because I live on a island and I can relate with the story. ;_;
S1 is definitely worth watching
It's brilliant
But Heroes got pretty confusing after a while.
I saw S1 on TV and loved it, kinda got bored during S2
Power of schizo.
since when was schizophernia a super power
Well, her 'other half' literally rips people in half
The power of DID!
Technically it's not schizophrenia, it's MPD.
So it's more than just that.
DID or MPD yeah, Schizo tend not to have multiple personalities ithink
/me noot sure-

08,01Unnr|Laptop: she really is; vocally talented too. unfortunately, over-produced and not really my kind of music
My IRC keeps derping...
Lady Gaga is nice, just not my type of music-yeah
Her last album was inspired by MLP.
And den Sylar was ded
There was a girl on Norwegian Melodi grand prix with a giant my little pony necklace, like one of the biiig dolls covered in rimstones and hung around her neck

Torrents tend to do that to me, which is why I usually avoid them. =/
It's gonna be woorth it in the eend

Limit the upload speed, that might help Gold_Demona
I rarely download torrents- but it seems to be working now that I've capped upload

so is anyone going to stream black mesa source?
I hope not.
^
because spoilers?
No.
Because I don't care about it.
Hello i'm back.........and boy am i pissed off
SPONGEBOB! :D
hi bronies
Meanwhile, why does it seems we end up agreeing on the most random of things?
worth it
Anyway, i'm pissed off as f**k :|
hey DaringDerpy
I don't know Panda.
hi DaringDerpy.
how are things DaringDerpy
why that Dark92Enigma
Oh I know who made this video. I love this guy
Hiyo DaringDerpy
things are alright, alexxm
Meanwhile, we need to converse more.
what happened Dark92Enigma
Panda: Indeed. But it'll probably turn out we only share a hatred of Nintendo and an uncaring attitude towards Half Life.
yeah Dark92Enigma
yes
Find waldo knife to jaw.
today that is
I got the newsletter.
08,01hmm
08,01you know what i should do
Meanwhile, some how I doubt that. Many times when 2 people share a couple commonalities, they tend to share more.
Meanwhile and you used a DIFFERENT E-MAIL TO DO SO????
i got the newsletter to the spam folder this week
08,01i shouhld give Koen a surprise visit on Valentine's Day
they probably used some banned words
08,01just randomly turn up at his
Dark92Enigma: Nope, same email I've always used.
08,01only problem is that it's on a Tuesday
08,01and total travel time is about 5 - 6 hours each way
08,01actualy, more than that including trains
08,01but yeah, i think it'd be quite romantic to just make an impromptu international flight and turn up with some flowers
Plan that for just a random day and it's more romantic.
Meanwhile: I didn't get a message on my Hotmail, i tried to get in with my name and last name.....and all i get is : The email you used has already been registered.You must be registered to complete this survey
08,01aye
08,01i think i will
Dark92Enigma: Well that sucks for you then.
So many operations
Where do i re-sign?? At least on Twitter and Facebook, they let me in, but i don't know where to ''re-assume'' my account
Dat Dr Who! :D
Dr Who.......helps me to calm my anger
what is the name of this song?
only for a while
Doctor Who Gallifreyan Buccaneer
i remember the reboot version of this
Dark92Enigma, you realize you can use a different email. Right?
Panda|Sorting: yes, but what if i run out of emails?
why use a different e-mail?
Hey guys...
lolrunoutofemails
hey dr-whooves
Dark92Enigma, how can you run out of emails. The amount of emails there can be on the internet are nearly infinite.
Tennantface.jpg
If Meanwhile can use the same e mail why some other don't? THIS MAKES AS MUCH SENSE AS THE ENDING TO BLAIR WITCH 2
That game is so glitchy
There was a Blair Witch 2?
:D
It's brilliant
Been conemplating suicide due to an infinite amount of bullshit, then i thougt, fuck taht ive got ponies, so i need some cheering up, whats streaming?
Mock the Week clip apparently.
First, Dark92Enigma, anything having to do with the "Blair Witch," makes no sense. Second, its probably a glitch in the system. Just make another email. It's what I would do anyway.
Panda|Sorting: yes, but i need to get into my mom's e-mail account, and that would mean to blow my cover as a brony
are
you all
undercover bronys?
Dark92Enigma: just create a new one.
lyrical nope.
Ok, i'll try to make another e-mail.....the key word being try
Depends, is that a misspelling of bronies?
panda
what is this?
Dark92Enigma you do not need higher privleges on a computer to create an email.
lyrical what is what.
go to
gmail
and create email
easy
what is this and why are these people laughing?
Typing in one sentence is easy too.
lyrical, not using the enter key is easy too.
hey man its just an addiction
like smoking
you know
nothing can be done
i know its wrong
LOL
but its just how it is
flood kick
Being a twonk is an addiction now?

dari
otakon used the enterkey often before using the enterkey was cool.
you know what? if you dont want to see me just kick me or ban me i wont get mad
honestly
It's easy to understand if you have greater mental comprehension than a cheese sandwich. Which is probablt why you're having difficulty.

nice
If you're going to hang around this room lyrical you should read the rules.
rules?
what kind of rules there can be?
lyrical, you arent special. Russian is a language. People know it.
i aint even russian man
http://www.bronystate.net/rules/
i live with them
what the fuck
is the stream?
oh wow...now the primitives attacked the german embassy
is it some roleplay shit ?
Guess you wandered in here from the chat client as opposed to the website.
in IRC
This room is linked to a livestream video service.
you mean
some one streaming the chat?
look, you are being an annoyance at the moment. I usually have a shy, calm demeanor, but you need to go, or stop.
I mean, someone is playing videos for the chat.
i dont getit
Like I said, intellect of a slab of brie.
please
vonderkid
explain better
lyrical, we're watching a video stream, so we're not allowed to link non image links
Anyone else try to click the anotation?
this chat is directly linked to said videostream
I'm sorry but I'm just not thick enough to explain it simpler.
you mean this chat goes to some streamers video chat?
I guess I could try and headbutt a wall a few times and then try again.
opposite, this chat is on a video stream site
like irc imbed
where the shit it streams
You know, there is a channel topic
give me website
Lawl

Jimmy Carr <3
Who is Jimmy Carr?
Seem to be getting more weird people the closer to ____ we get
Jimmy Carr is hilarious
This guy on stream.
Hold on, let me turn the stream on.
What is the topic?
Fuckbuddies :D

This is why you don't heckle comedians
Of course he is, he's gold.
Aww dari, search for his most offensive joke.
Hiya

Panda|Sorting, what is a Slag?

hey DaringDerpy and alexxm =
Hello everyone! :) How are you all today?
Hi DaringDerpy and alexxm! :)
Hi AJIsAwesome!
hi AJIsAwesome :)
/me hugs Wirisme and DaringDerpy. :)
:)
how are things AJIsAwesome
alexxm: Pretty good. Just finished some tests.
hey AJIsAwesome
Mfw my programming teacher took off 5% of my score for an assignment because i added a few extra spaces before a few lines of code and its not aligned with the other lines, even though i did it to distinguish it from the rest
God damn this is funny.
coomplaain
dat comment section
Dat Iranian culture
twilight_sprinklenap, learn from it. Misaligned code can be a real pain in the flank.
RainbowAsh i did it on purpose though, it was a small program so it helped distinguish that part from the rest
RainbowAsh and its not worth 5 percent
Pistachio nuts.
EXACTLY
Iran's claiming that they aren't making nuclear bombs, but they just want it for energy and nothing else.
Er, the Iranian government.
twilight_sprinklenap, yeah, probably not. But there are better ways to distinguish parts of code, like comments or putting it in seperate functions or methods.
Go away Kandarihu, you're too much of a stick in the mud for comedy streams.
Meanwhile, could you please not censor me?
Only when you stop being someone's grumpy dad.
Heya guys
Kandarihu, yeah, but how believable are those claims?
RainbowAsh, some people are falling for them... I think.
RainbowAsh i know but the program and lines were so small, that adding comments would just be unncssary
would he have decked you five percent if you had tabbed them?
Woo
Dance tiem
ohai MLP_Brovakiin ")
*:)
nice dancing
Aww... I just bought deux ex, the original.
One thing about tests in art and writing that took me a while to get, is that we're testing if we've understood the rules, not whether or not we can bend them. Once you understand the rules you can break them to do what you need to do. Don't know if the same principle stands in that programming test
But i can't play it, cuz it says: Failed to find steam
O.o-
Need help q_q
Vivix, well put.
Vivix: he only sent out the criteria after the assignemnt tho. plus i dont thats in there
All I really know about the Iranian people are that they're a nice people who have no ill will towards anyone.
My brain just twitched from the last message.
Ah- okay
But fair enough, hi all
Hiya
i like this guys godzilla impression
Godzilla bellydancing to indian music, wow
how are things KnifeH
but yeah RainbowAsh, if I had gotten that during the time I had art tests and such, I probably woulda gotten better grades <,<.. /regrets
Next Heroes ep?

Sounds fine
omg i missed a heroes ep?
Yeah, you missed ep 13

Vivix: wait I thought that was half life source oO

Wait?! :O

This after they classified Carbon Dioxide as a pollutant?
08,01hugh grant!
What is this?
13"Specifically, the EPA will require that consumers purchase a minimum of four gallons when buying from a gas station that sells gasoline containing 10 percent ethanol and 15 percent ethanol — also known as “E15″ — out of the same gas pump."

Pfft, no that's exactly what happened.
I see a little silhouette of Tennant.
oh boy, it feels like years since i have been on the site.
Tennant! <3
Welcome back AJTheMightyGamer
:P
I think only Sumica, Wrek and Phase4 have desktop OCs.
hooray!
Well, welcome back, AJTheMightyGamer! :)
Nittany has one too.
Well, Black Mesa Source is installing now
/me spins on the floor
Oh?
I thought Scoots had one too.
Hello everyone.
As does Scoots.
Ohai VenHur! :)
hi VenHur
I thought they only had regular OCs.
And what about SlurryMoon?
Heya VenHur
Oh hi, Tennant.
Don't think Slurry has one.
Hi Mr.Tennant <3
/me swoons
13.////.
I was going to get a cup of tea, but I think that can wait.
Wasn't there one OC where he makes a tornado?
LadyCanary: might I swoon alongside you?
hi there Shizuka
oh, dr who
yay this episode:)
Suddenly, Shizuka.
AJIsAwesome Nittany's yes
Shizu, can we share? .////.
13ancient romans don't notice a man in a suit
killerpony7733: OH........:$
I think he explains that
Can't remember
big city, lots of crazy people
AJIsAwesome Ya like his OC?
Si fueris alibi, vivito sicut ibi.
killerpony7733: Yeah, I like it. I just haven't seen it in a while.
AJIsAwesome Nittany hasn't been too much around for a while
My installation of Black Mesa Source is going slowly.
So apparently Rome is like Soho
And I think I know why.
Well, that's enough for the clothes.
Kandarihu I can't even get a hold of a decent non turrent DL
killerpony7733: I know. I hope he's alright.
13little red riding hood noooo
XD
Kandarihu torrent*
killerpony7733, oh, I think the torrent is part of the problem, but not from being defunct.
OH NOES!
Hahaha, property damage.
...Oh shiiiit
13all the children look forward to volcano day
volcano day, brings back memories of Captian jack :(
dat reference
Kandarihu Well for me the EU download is down then one or two of the global ones are sucky and really can't DL for me
this is the first time for me seeing dr who
I put it on my external HDD, and I'm seeding it from there, AND I'm trying to install it from the 7z atthe same time.
13the torrent has abysmal seeders
13but i'm 33% through so no sense starting the direct now
AJTheMightyGamer: You're alright. People say this is the best doctor.
oh the noes
The real screwiness is that my upload is going at about 6MB/s which is about twice the upstream I'm supposed to have.
I'm new to Doctor Who, too.
AJIsAwesome: well, he seems pretty cool
Was anyone going to stream the Black Mesa thing?
new riches
00,10by the time you hit 50 Shizuka the direct would be done
I just realised that I need steam to play black mesa source and I dont have steam :D
So I'm probably overloading my USB Cable like this
Hey Guys
13not at my direct speeds
13i never get 1M/s with http
Shizuka: where do i put the file for the Black Mesa port?
No? Good.
00,10Sounds like a limiter problem
Sumi!

/me tilts head.
Shizuka: I dun geddit
Shizu: Not sure if fashion or new Star Trek movie.
both
Face of...stone? Oh sh-.
is the daughter the woman who plays amy pond?
No
Makes sense to me. :P
hey
I'm guessing it's Star Trek fashion?
TARDIS Time Lord, yeah
so... can someone tell me what this show is about?
Spaceman
whats is the movie/show
doctor who
AJTheMightyGamer: Time traveler who saves the universe.
It's set in ancient Roman times
Rainbow, this is Doctor Who
With a man who's ahead of his time
And wears a suit
ohai Rainbow. :)
oh i've never seen doctor qho
*who
Return the slab!
AJIsAwesome: seems normal to me. :)
Oh, an there's some random person made of stone
ohai AJisawesome
and*
not bad
13oh there's why
Remids me of the drapes in The Room. :D
13blocks are 4MB on the black mesa torrent
*Reminds*
:D doctor who has epic british voice
13which means the bad seeds will take longer to give you their piece and move on
Yeah. Started the torrent this morning when it released. Its only 50 percent done. Direct download will be done a lot faster.
brb letting mah dog out >.>
true, Rainbow
XDD
Wait, does it cost money to download then?
Via direct?
Alright. Firing up Black Mesa
00,10was wondering if it was a badly writen torrent, seeing as the tracker was 16megs
13they should have made the piece size much smaller, you're committed to 4MB at a time from a seed the way it is now, and these seeds are stupidly slow
marvel inspector

That was probably a fake release date.

Psychics, psychics everywhere

13other than the shacknews download, all the other mirrors are broken
ohai IshSexiestPony :)
hi IshSexiestPony
Okay, so the Transit system ride on Black Mesa Source. It's BEAUTIFUL.
Stupid Sexy Dari
Ohai
13don't spoil it
how are things IshSexiestPony
13i want to stream it later
They should announce the date for the announcement for the S3 date

Oh so there will be Black Mesa stream?
o3o
13comcast willing
Even if they did, we'd still have to wait.
i is here tooz
Ipso facto, arcanum arcanorum.
Damn, I was hoping to not have to ignore stream for however long.
^^
00,10inb4 every one streames it
Hi Guys!
Shizuka: I got the fileshack one to work.
DAT JUMPCUT
ohai grayhoof :)
13someone will beat me to it anyway i'm sure
Sumica: Mm, probably. Going to be a very dull day.
Stupid Sexy Docter
^
13i spoke too soon, the fileshack one crashed
That sucks.
back
Shizuka: It's all slow, as far as I can tell.
Shizuka: Toreeeeent
wb Rainbow
13i am using torrent
Also hi everyone
Shizuka: Just get it from shacknews :$
13the seeds are horrible
what we eatching anyhow guyz???
^
Eyep
ohai Reikim|Preread :)
13i just told you the shacknews crashed
Oh...
Funny, you'd think everyone and their mother would be torrenting it.
00,10if this direct works shizu we can try skype, it's probably faster =p
its showing doctor who
Fileshack = shacknews. derp.
13skype barely breaks 100k/s
Reikim|Preread: Which is why they're all goofed.
:|
Meanwhile: The torrent, not the DDL.
00,10the torrent is pooorly witen and full of seeders that dont know how to torrent properly
It dun goofed.
00,10exactly Shizuka =p
There's a proper way to torrent?
ha, i just time traveld to the futrue, and i know all about season 3! morgan freeman saves the man 6 from bowser, fluttershy turns into a dish washer for some reason, and rainbow dash becomes an orange
Reikim|Preread: Yeah that really doesn't mean anything to me.
they have eyes on their hands?
13found a tarball link someone on spuf is hosting, going to see if laptop can wget faster than torrent
Sumica, I'm seeding like crazy here.
00,10well there are better ways to torrent yes
thats wrong
Meanwhile: There's torrenting and then there's Direct Download. They're different thingies, and work differently. That's about all you need to know.
13i'm doing 340k/s down, 220 up
AJTheMightyGamer: I knew that season 3 would ruin everything. The Man 6. =\
holy fuck 1 day to download this
I am so, so sorry.
Reikim|Preread: Fair enough.
lol brb
*mane
So what's a *good* way to torrent?
=/
Shizuka If this link and all is gonna keep up from shacknews i say 4 hours max till it finishes
Even the falsehoods are important.
I usually just pop open torrents in my client and forget about it...
00,101.2 down on the direct from that one you said was down Shizuka
<_<
00,10Bronysith, it should go faster as more seeded are finished
Sumica: righto, but still along time lols
Is he in the past or future?
Bronysith: I spent a week downloading Mass Effect. Your argument is invalid.
Hm. GameConnect was pretty fast for me.
BROHOOF anyone?
i'm auctally kinda engoying doctor who
13wasn't down, just died
*enjoying
pony_7616: /)
Anyone really not care about Black Mesa at all?
pony_7616 /)
pony_7616: You new here?
ima girl though
pony_7616 /)
Meanwhile: Me. :$
yeah
We should watch Hercules the Legendary Journeys
i have no idea what this black messa thing is all i know is that it's the science place in half life
pony_7616: Well, welcome to Bronystate! Make sure to read the rules. :)
Great, that's a total of 3 including myself.
i needa see the rules where are they?
Meanwhile: Me too
4.
Meanwhile: It's not my style, but people can like it if they want to.
13great now we get to listen to people bitching about the general excitement for a mod that's been in development for eight years
i already did
Yeah you do
Deal with it.
Im meeeelting me-or not
rb
I'm not bitching, it's just not my style of game. :S
Well, he asked, so I answered
AJIsAwesome: what? you dont like good games?
I haven't been on anyone's back about it
Bronysith: It's just not something I would really play, TBH.
I'm going to try it out just for fun.
Take Borderlands, for example. It seems like a great game, but it's not something that I would play.
*Borderlands 2*
Never played Half Life. I'm psyched to have a chance to play it for free.
/me is a cheap bastard
Same thing with Mass Effect and Half Life.
Reikim|Preread: hehe, i only paid 10 bucks for every single half life
thank you steam sales
13pulling 1M/s from this tarball even while torrent is still going
22.3 KB/s for me right now
I'm hardly going to begrudge people for wanting to play it, I'm just wholly uninterested.
Is that...is that a whole megabyte per second?
/me dies of envy
13it comes and goes rei, it's averaging closer to 600k/s
See Shizu, thing is, a rate like that is a bit of a punch in the gut for me.
13it's pulling directly from some guy's seedbox they linked on the steam forums
i have no rush to play this game
You know, seeing as I usually average...maybe twenty kb/s? On a good day.
so i dont care how long it takes lol
>20 kb/s
Gesundheit.
What did it say?
Most days I'm pulling single-digit download speeds.
WHat?
13DSL?
danke
What did it say?
That's almost the level of otakon's carrier pigeon system
Single-digit kilobytes, mind you.
Hehehe.
HA
DaringDerpy: Bitte.
13dialup?
watch out he has a water pistol
You know, I'm kind of annoyed he's not here for that.
:)
Stupid Sexy Everypony
13carrier pigeons make up for in transfer time what they do in amount
only fucking 19.2 Kb/s :D
ok i read the rules
No, it's not dialup, but it tends to go reeeaaaally slowly. I have no idea why.
13strap an SD card to a pigeon and he'll average gigabytes per second
XD
Don't they have hundred-gigabyte USB drives by now?
/me still likes carrier pigeons. :$
filesharing is very underdeveloped
13shipping a terabyte hard drive somewhere is faster than transferring over network
I know 32G is common.
no commercial networks
13micro-SD is in the 64GB range i think
I would LOVE to have a terabyte hardrive. :O

AJIsAwesome: I have 3 TB across two hard drives. I'm going to need more soon.
Reikim|Preread: Something like that.
Kammerjunk: Same here
Kammerjunk: Wow........:O
I've got a 2 and a 1
How do you even
Ditto.
THANKS DARI!
13i'm sitting on 2.5TB if you don't count my other externals and boxen
<:
I've got a mere 500GB here on this laptop and I'm far from filling it.
13if you do, probably 2.8
Oh yeah, there's the fileserver with a few TB, but I don't count it.
I barely use it, anyway.
I need to find a terabyte hard drive. :D
Pompeii is fixed! It can't have children.
i have 2 TB of memory
13my server is only 80GB
How do you need a terabyte?
AJIsAwesome: They're not that expensive, I reckon.
13steam
XD
Kammerjunk: Really? :S
O.o
13seriously the vast majority of my drive space is steam
Reikim|Preread: On my fileserver, I have 1 TB video alone.
Kammerjunk: For that much memory?
You must have a LOT of Steam games, SHizu.
Shizuka: Yeah, Steam takes a lot.
13i do
£60 for a 2TB drive maybe?
13i play a small fraction of them, but i leave almost all of them installed
Wow.......
13because install time is pffft
That's cheap. :O
the balrog left middle earth i see
13yeah 2TB is crashing in price
they dug too far
Lawl
I think the monster may be a little hot under the collar. Seems angry.
now the balrog is not amused
I'm already excited about getting a petabyte hard drive when I can.
ekips: It's because it wasn't allowed to pass.
lol petabyte
Kammerjunk: Wait, petabyte?
...Petabyte.
That's a thing now?
Rocky 4.
AJIsAwesome: 1024 TB.
Gandalf should have used a water pistol too... he would have won instantly
hardrive talk
Kammerjunk: OH MY GOSH...........:O
Reikim|Preread: Well, not realistically, but yeah.
13google runs in the petabytes
i gtg
13if not exabytes, the next tier up
bye Rainbow :)
Shizuka: Yup. What was it? 20 PB per day?
Handled data, that is.
bye rainbow
Rock solid plan Doctor
13basically a stupidly high number
Dat pun
I didn't even know there were exabytes. :D
Not being too familiar with the series, I must ask, does the show have a reason for why he doesn't go back in time to stop certain deaths and disasters?
IshSexiestPony: Paradoxes.
No. Bad pun.
Because they're fixed points in time
13yottabyte is the highest recognized tier i think
Shizuka: How much memory?
IshSexiestPony: The timeline does not like paradoxes.
If he changed them the whole of history and the future would be destroyed pretty much
13or might be zetabyte, not sure which one's higher since we don't usually operate up there yet
You can't go back in time and interfear with your own personal history either.
Or else you might end up being your own grandfather
Shizuka: Probably will eventually.
13each tier is 1024x the next lower
why 1024?
Stallion_of_War thats Futurama silly
Wirisme: Because binary.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THESE THINGS EXISTS. :O
Oh yeah
*EXIST*
13bytes are 8 bits, 1024 is 1 followed by 10 zeroes in binary
YOL TOR SHOL!
13so it's sort of like base ten, only expressible in round binary
Well, it's Pompei or paradox.
Oh, someone asked why 1024?
They gon' kill everyone in Pompeii
Because powers of two, of course.
By the power of two!
I have the power!
/me gangnam styles on Sumica
131024 is the nearest power of two to a power of ten
20k v all of humanity...
If he were a vulcan he'd have no problem whatsoever.
So I can't use a tardis to go back in time and make my life better? :(
The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
Meanwhile: and the british
IshSexiestPony: Nope. Paradoxes.
http://nooooooooooooooo.com/
Shizuka: what about 0?
Guess which race most often gets labeled as cold-hearted bastards?
IshSexiestPony: One of two things would probably happen: 1) TIME PARADOX. 2) Alternate reality.
130 is zero
but 1MB == 1000kB
Reikim|Preread: The English?
13zero doesn't count
Reikim|Preread: Which one?
chat derped on me, well i am back from lunch
losing the whole planet would cause a few problems in the plotline
bicyclerepairman: Wut, no
13just like 1
00,10if you tryed that then langolears show up and eat every one on earth who is not in a realy old building
Meanwhile: Yes, but not the answer I'm looking for.
1MB = 1024 KB
and why do they not count :(
13zero isn't a power of anything
LOL Tennants face.
you're thinking about about MiB
13or rather
13zero is a power of everything, it doesn't count
Whut not
*no
13you can't reach zero by exponents, anything to the power zero is 1

Fun Fact: Soothsayers sometimes reincarnate as Amy Pond
Meanwhile: Do ho ho.
Roo, ringer in ry rutt
because kilo, Mega and all the rest are SI prefixes defined by powers of ten
Well screw that
You've got to go back, Doctor! Back - to the future!
1MB = 1024KB, I don't care about the other system
Just this once Rose, EVERONE DIES!
there's no other system :D
13except the other system is metric
Kaunt
I can see why people love this doctor.
He just kaunt
13SI wants to define a megabyte to mean 1000 kilobytes
He did nauht.
Now what he needs to say here
Is definitely
"Come with me if you want to live"
This is killing my heartstring.
13and if a kilobyte is defined as 1000 bytes, then the new megabyte is significantly smaller than the true megabyte in powers of 1024
/me dat vworp
Wait a minute, doesn't this cause a paradox?
ADVENTURE
"Get to the chop... Tardis!"
Oh wait NVm.
http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=591_1347578176
Why would is AJIsAwesome?
13nonetheless, hard drive manufacturers build to powers of ten, which is why a 1TB hard drive only holds 900GB
well, the true Megabyte is 1,000,000 byte
4 people in 20,000. Who'd notice?
Shizuka: Wouldn't that completely screw over the entire thing? I mean, powers of two are just /natural/ for data, what with everything being in binary. A 1000-kb megabyte would just cause unnecessary problems.
and the one in powers of 2 is just the binary approximation to the true megabyte
13and now you understand the mebibyte/megabyte holy war
That roman guy looks oddly hispanic
13just like vi/emacs and pc/mac before it

Oh, mai.........:P

Which is funny, given Echo is a greek mythological story
oh my
13on the same pipe no less
Shizuka: There's absolutely no possibility of loaning me a bit of your connection, is there? Via magic?
Shizuka: Really? ._. I'm on 1.7MB/s.
Vulcan's all "Get the buck off my island, dumb mortals"
13the torrent is horrible
I am so gutted for the Doctor right now.
That's a pretty good wallpaper right there.
With the standing and the smoking.

Stallion_of_War: Pompeii is on the italian mainland, not an island

Top comment on video - This video makes me cry tears of joy every time I watch it. The video for Sæglópur makes me cry tears of sadness every time. I know of no other band in the world that can play with emotions as well as Sigur Rós can. Their music is a﻿ spiritual experience.
