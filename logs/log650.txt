Oh, you're talking about /those/ sorts of things.
yes
ello comrades
Sorry, overlooked those.
no one cares about kinect
Mostly because personally I don't pay attention to them, sorry.
well i only look hardware and software wise
13http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/09/12/why_the_japan_china_island_dispute_is_an_american_problem
thx
eh well no worrys i found it quite fun and even won a few games of chess :)
The rules for submiting a story now is kinda stupid
All ze graphics everywhere
they outright copy the first one and upgrade everything it have
d'oh
No and I quote "X-rated content, including sexually transgressive or gorey stories"
Perhaps from a software standpoint.
And now we talkin bout war
About graphics, though.
6I have 11482 favourites on dA.. o.0
There is a few more
:O
thats alot :P
Did you hear about that American ambassador?
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/01/story-submission-guidelines.html
I feel obligated to mention that, despite the graphics limitation, some of the most artistically beautiful games are on the Wii.
6Yeah xD
13was the ambassador the eve player or was that a different diplomat?
PS3 has some too, but they aren't games that use the graphics engine for its intended purpose (playing Crysis)
^ Joke
13saw a bunch of reddit threads about how eve online has come to a halt for a memorial, really nice
6It's 3 years worth of favs but it still seems like too many :P
O.o
HAY GUYS
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6de_DXS4z4 watch dis
Heck, even the 360 had beautiful artistic games.
Actually
13note to self
Fuck everything I've said before
13english needs syntax highlighting
Syntax highlighting?
its like 10:25PM and I should be going to be.... naw screw it! ponies are worth it.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RSF7Z8nGwQ&feature=BFa&list=FL5QyBGi4t1uDa0FwakXNeYQ
One does not simply have too many favorites
6xDDD
We would use colours, but we'd get kicked for it.
here comes the kick
13forget who's running color kicks but ja ctcps still aren't checked
Anyway, Trix...what I'm saying is, I prefer games like Masamune that have an "artsy" style.
Or Okami.
Why?
6Brb..need to find something to eat.. ._.
I'm sick of the market's massive bias towards "realistic" graphics.
haha k
6Cause I'm hungry and there isn't much atm xD
But that's just me.
6:O Noodles..k,brb xD
k
Does BP do that?
mmmmm
Anyway
I'll be fair with all consoles.
I don't think any console is "better" than another.
I WANT THAT PICTURE
It's the devs and the publishers that make the difference.
a console is a tool
It's how they are used.
^
For example, the PS3.
Flootashy just refresh till u get the pic
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6de_DXS4z4 <- this
Then the entire market got flooded with FPS clones.
WUT
You can scroll through all of them.
/me refreshes fimfiction
Then graphics became more important than gameplay.
But now...
13speaking of, i get the sense chat's had enough mvm stream for a while
A couple friends of mine on Fimfiction have agreed that the site has gone downhill. They really don't have standards much anymore.
We've also got gems like The Last of Us coming out.
13unless i did day after tomorrow rifftrax tonight
I still have not gotten over that one...
Yes
13don't have that..
I'm looking for an excuse to play- dammit
is it me, or is fimfiction actually supports shipping?
i gave you a key
13still don't have it
and sex
lots of sex stories
lots of se
/me 13checks log
Dammit ninja'd
13wasn't this month was it
The only thing they care is if there are ponies from the show and it isn't a metafic
around2 weeks i think
or My inmortal..... Pony version.....
About system copying.
I finally got my research links open...
Yeah, they copied off one another, but only in software.
fuck you EQD
I have a lot of work to do for my fics, but I've slowed down a lot. I'm being careful with my writing style.
The base systems, as they were released, could not have been clones. They were too close together.
13could l4d1 some more.. haven't streamed blood harvest recently
whoa.
i don't delete my keys until sure
Hm
Electick sockets lolwut
We still haven't played Alien Swarm, have we?
We should do that.
electric*
13alien swarm was kind of... eh..
Hey, when I posted my fic... I never knew about the whole 1 fic per 5minutes
It's fun with friends.
13may have just been the people we got stuck with but i didn't find it particularly interesting :/
or is it 10minutes, whatever
lol
It's more fun when you have good people.
I spent a solid three hours on it once with a friend.
Its one of their rules
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7Hiqa8ainU&feature=plcp
Part of the problem was there were only two of us, but eh.
no stream?
no
Damn, no
He would have been hilarious.
aw
"holy shit this is amazi- oh wait. Human" *drops it to trash*
but it's fine, we're still here
Are you people talking about Equestria Daily now?
Ooooh
I read "Drocsid" (the more completed fic) to my cousin. He liked it. My boss read the first chapter of it. He was blown away.
BC I had them wish me luck with my fic
13followed the remake development up until he disappeared to make it a $10 mod
yep.
Yeah, that sucked.
Drocsid........ Thats celestia backwards right?
Mind screwy.
Hm?
he hates ignitus O_O
why would celestia have a d in it
13like the narration worked but the music was way choppy
13sounded awful
Never experienced that.
celestiad
Right, not that then.
Stanley Parable?
13could do stanley again
13encore of my first stream
Done all the routes yet?
13oh yes

I panicked pretty hard when everything became hopeless.

Yup

ahaha

I LIKE PIE
13you heard there's a remake of that coming ja?
Remake?
13it's on greenlight
Probably because the ones usually sent in before were not well developed fics or just plain terrible ones.
key is not working for some reason

Well, I'm going to be without my mom's laptop at that time.
Uh uh
When I tried both I found C++...easier? More fluid? More elegant?
Elegant's probably a good word.

I played some Starcraft 2, but I kept running into idiots. One person asked when Heart of the Swarm patch was coming. He snapped when I told him he had to buy it.
Says a little something about the gullibility of the average person.
seeya nitty
....people seriously didn't know that the Starcraft expansions would need to be purchased?
How can you be that dumb? ._.
The author has a personality. I'm not falling asleep.

13i think emacs runs on "we can do more than text edit" while vi runs on "we only text edit, but we do it well!"
13vim is an enhanced fork of vi, i like it cause for plain editing you don't have to dig too far in
It was on the main page. The UI is weird.

consoles are just oversized gameboys
11,02Just because you're the first to something doesn't make you automatically the best.
I have nothing against consoles, I have something against bad consoles.
00,10innovation is not always good
00,02consoles are platforms for games, its the games that matter

Hello, everyone.

When you say sword arts do you mean it as a sport?

Right, sorry I'm just thinking in my MMA mode, more into self defense and by rolling you put yourself in great risk in fights :/

Katanas
not rapiers
Right oops, forgot you mentioned katanas 6_9
when i spar with people we use non bladed katanas cause solid wooden ones hurt much more

Oh... Huh.
HAHAAHAHHA
It was in the kitchen.

With a shirt sieve.
Although thinking about it she did slap me with her dressing gown sleeves as well.
And a measuring jug.
jeez
Oooooh.
One time I walked downstairs and she hit me with a cornstalk.
I don't even know where she got that.
She has literally slapped me with a fish before.

Hardly source

This is a mod or total conversion of HL1 to actual source with alot more improved source graphics and weapons etc etc
Saturn: dont drink it
It's techinally a HD HL1
ahh
HOLT IT/um hello everyone
oh, but I thought there was a cource remake already, though I've never played with it.
oh hey, 32 minutes
The official source remake was a port to the source engine
no one replied just as i expected :'(
to waht
yeah-
thats it?
yeah HLS was--pretty much HL1 with ragdolls
pretty much
yeah
well it was more like
it was free
but it was more like.."Hey, look what's possible with sdk"
yeah
but it was free right? I payed nothing-
or free with hl2?
just under half an hour now till BM:S
ikr.
hehe
yeah
less than 30 minutesss...
/me jitters
I had several hl1s because of the CS pack and such, but those are the only ones that survived time <,<
hl1?
yeah
Well, I'll be downloading it when I get my computer back.
Hehe, same
Er, when I get my mom's laptop back.
Anybody here to rant at?
Or ded?
brewing headache?
You've been up to long, go to sleep.
sometimes cold or headache makes them feel weird
now my eyes are fine
Hm
Am I still here?
yeah
Huh.
apparently
if you are seeing auras you are not a psychic, you are about to have a migraine :)
Odd, my computer claims it has no connection.
weird-
Don't listen to him, we are real. promise
And you kind of made us to make up for that.
O.o
yeah, that should fix it :D
Really?
Why would they be coming to an end?
:D
are we about to adopt solipsism?
ohhh
Oh?

Aha
/me goes back to sleep.
Le gnight then.
._.
Or rather, by sleep I mean work.
...
I have this but no browsing.
Maybe they waited?
Oh hey it's back.
I wouldn't get my prereading done and someone would be very disappointed.
I wouldnt be sorry for me being a skeptic...
"Sorry, I didn't get it done. Someone set it on fire"
Lol
My point exactly.
On the OTHER hand, if I have an excuse to not get it done, I won't ahve to deal with it.

Whote?
/me shudders happily
08,01*white
really?
Hello everyone :)
like...I played that for weeeks
What's it about?
Anyway about ranting.
kiinda but--different gameplay
Just dealing with some atrocious use of the English language here.
yeah- and it was pretty inovative back then, I think-
On top of that, I've got a pretty bad plot to deal with.
you're not in direct control thoguh
I may be required to vent.
it's--hard to explain
you can't select individual people, but you can pick up people and give them a "divine calling"
yeah-
Interesting. I may have to look into this. I like games like that
also, jerking the mouse in all directions possible for a fraking miracle...
heh
Right, was called on to clean rodents, what's going on now?
true- I could do most of them, but sometimes it took me a while
yeah, you can train it to eat citizens
or tress
yeah
*trees
First off
and catch rocks when you throw it at him
Apparently this is a ship that happens.
or just beat him up with the rocks-
or to be a builder or gatherer or soldier etc
yeah
i find it confusing in games like that you can only be a paragon of viture or a complete monster with no middle ground
well in BM you can be kinda middle I think
I was a few times-
7 minutes!
heya :)
Woo!
Hehe
If it were a crack pairing, and treated as such, then that would be okay.
But taking it seriously?
yeah I think you can get mana or resources by sacrificing people, thats NOt going for the good side of the scale :D
There is no rule of shipping that I'm aware of, but it's pretty much the same as R34, nothing is sacred and there are no exceptions.
hehe
And here I thought I'd seen everything.
How should numbers be written out?
yeaahh
For story purpose, depends on the context.
http://derpy.me/-YprE :D
it was awesome! :D
3 MINUTES
I also loved the music and side quests
Also because of the destruction engine, I liked to accidentally break houses <,<
Oh
If you were reading the text as the story you should use the word form, if you were reading a text within the story itself you would use whatever best paints the image you're trying to convey.
Meh
:O
dabi pls
Thanks. It's good to know I haven't been wrong all this time.
<3
For example, "The note reads '1 17 2 5'"
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdKuNtV9WbM

I see.
Good, I'll make sure to note that.
But back to ship-rants.

Oh, don't care.
Yeah I've heard of it, not interested.
Good for you.
Don't worry about it, though.
There are far too many buffers for lagship troopers.

Their servers must be bombarded with all the constant refreshing and all
Should compile them and dro

They ain't no Valve.
00,02the cloudflare 'is offline' page is being appended to the normal page
And we're treating them like Valve.
Anyone played the first level yet?
:D
Hat: We can't get to the website yet. :P
That's a good one.
00,02wait nvm, the append was just a derp (i clicked wrong thing)
00,02page is just broke

Doing a fic?
Progress is progress.
Editing.
See my tag?
Mmmm.
And that's the first chapter.
That's quite impressive
That reminds me that I should go back and edit my old fic from way back when.
I'm not writing it, I'm editing it.
And it /hurts/.
Given Rei's tendency to get lumped with bad fics, I imagine it's quite painful.
Lol.
You'd think I'd have built up a resistance to it by now.
Noooooooo

SDK 2007 yeah
Can't you just say "Yeah it really does suck, I can't do a thing with it."
I liked Goldeneye Source

The torrent option is not working! D=
Panic!!

Oh I haven't watched heroes, is it good?
Heroes is brilliant
Well S1 anyway
Lost was bettar.
But I liked Lost because I live on a island and I can relate with the story. ;_;
S1 is definitely worth watching
It's brilliant
But Heroes got pretty confusing after a while.
Power of schizo.
Well, her 'other half' literally rips people in half
The power of DID!
Technically it's not schizophrenia, it's MPD.
DID or MPD yeah, Schizo tend not to have multiple personalities ithink

Yeah
S1 has a pretty conclusive end IIRC

08,01Unnr|Laptop: she really is; vocally talented too. unfortunately, over-produced and not really my kind of music
Lady Gaga is nice, just not my type of music-yeah
And den Sylar was ded
Saturn: its still nice to see pop-artists not being complete and total asshats to their fans.
But not really.
08,01Unnr|Laptop: aye

You saw her too?
Okies, see everyone later. Its puppy o´clock

Apparently HydraIRC won't let you scroll very far back
Hmm

Yes it is
Torrents tend to do that to me, which is why I usually avoid them. =/
It's gonna be woorth it in the eend

08,01actualy, more than that including trains
Saturn: school on Tuesdays?
08,01but yeah, i think it'd be quite romantic to just make an impromptu international flight and turn up with some flowers
Plan that for just a random day and it's more romantic.

13i'm doing 340k/s down, 220 up
lol brb
*mane
=/
Even the falsehoods are important.
I usually just pop open torrents in my client and forget about it...
<_<
00,10Bronysith, it should go faster as more seeded are finished
Is he in the past or future?
Hm. GameConnect was pretty fast for me.
13wasn't down, just died
*enjoying
yeah
We should watch Hercules the Legendary Journeys
Great, that's a total of 3 including myself.
i needa see the rules where are they?
4.
i already did
Yeah you do
Deal with it.
I haven't been on anyone's back about it
I'm going to try it out just for fun.
*Borderlands 2*
/me is a cheap bastard
13pulling 1M/s from this tarball even while torrent is still going
22.3 KB/s for me right now
I'm hardly going to begrudge people for wanting to play it, I'm just wholly uninterested.
Is that...is that a whole megabyte per second?
/me dies of envy
13it comes and goes rei, it's averaging closer to 600k/s
>20 kb/s
Gesundheit.
13DSL?
danke
Single-digit kilobytes, mind you.
Hehehe.
HA
13dialup?
You know, I'm kind of annoyed he's not here for that.
:)
only fucking 19.2 Kb/s :D
ok i read the rules
No, it's not dialup, but it tends to go reeeaaaally slowly. I have no idea why.
13strap an SD card to a pigeon and he'll average gigabytes per second
XD
/me still likes carrier pigeons. :$
filesharing is very underdeveloped
13shipping a terabyte hard drive somewhere is faster than transferring over network
I know 32G is common.
no commercial networks
13micro-SD is in the 64GB range i think
Vulcan neck cult
*hard drive*
I've got a 2 and a 1
How do you even
Ditto.
THANKS DARI!
13i'm sitting on 2.5TB if you don't count my other externals and boxen
<:
I've got a mere 500GB here on this laptop and I'm far from filling it.
13if you do, probably 2.8
Oh yeah, there's the fileserver with a few TB, but I don't count it.
I barely use it, anyway.
I need to find a terabyte hard drive. :D
Pompeii is fixed! It can't have children.
i have 2 TB of memory
13my server is only 80GB
How do you need a terabyte?
13steam
XD
O.o
13i do
£60 for a 2TB drive maybe?
Wow.......
13because install time is pffft
That's cheap. :O
13yeah 2TB is crashing in price
they dug too far
Lawl
I think the monster may be a little hot under the collar. Seems angry.
I'm already excited about getting a petabyte hard drive when I can.
lol petabyte
...Petabyte.
That's a thing now?
hardrive talk
13google runs in the petabytes
i gtg
13if not exabytes, the next tier up
bye Rainbow :)
Handled data, that is.
bye rainbow
Dat pun
I didn't even know there were exabytes. :D
Not being too familiar with the series, I must ask, does the show have a reason for why he doesn't go back in time to stop certain deaths and disasters?
No. Bad pun.
Because they're fixed points in time
13yottabyte is the highest recognized tier i think
If he changed them the whole of history and the future would be destroyed pretty much
13or might be zetabyte, not sure which one's higher since we don't usually operate up there yet
13each tier is 1024x the next lower
why 1024?
I CAN'T BELIEVE THESE THINGS EXISTS. :O
Oh yeah
*EXIST*
13bytes are 8 bits, 1024 is 1 followed by 10 zeroes in binary
YOL TOR SHOL!
13so it's sort of like base ten, only expressible in round binary
Oh, someone asked why 1024?
They gon' kill everyone in Pompeii
Because powers of two, of course.
By the power of two!
I have the power!
131024 is the nearest power of two to a power of ten
If he were a vulcan he'd have no problem whatsoever.
The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
http://nooooooooooooooo.com/
130 is zero
but 1MB == 1000kB
13zero doesn't count
losing the whole planet would cause a few problems in the plotline
13just like 1
1MB = 1024 KB
and why do they not count :(
13zero isn't a power of anything
LOL Tennants face.
you're thinking about about MiB
13or rather
13zero is a power of everything, it doesn't count
Whut not
*no
13you can't reach zero by exponents, anything to the power zero is 1
1MiB == 1024kiB
LUNA NO!
13mebibytes can go die
^
they would have never made it... the whole point of pompej was that it was one of the fastest vulcano erruptions ever
now kiss
13kibibytes and tebibytes can die too
lim b^x x->-infinity --> 0
Now I am become Gigabyte, destroyer of systems.
Roo, ringer in ry rutt
Well screw that
1MB = 1024KB, I don't care about the other system
Just this once Rose, EVERONE DIES!
there's no other system :D
13except the other system is metric
Kaunt
He just kaunt
13SI wants to define a megabyte to mean 1000 kilobytes
He did nauht.
Is definitely
"Come with me if you want to live"
This is killing my heartstring.
/me dat vworp
ADVENTURE
"Get to the chop... Tardis!"
Oh wait NVm.
http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=591_1347578176
13nonetheless, hard drive manufacturers build to powers of ten, which is why a 1TB hard drive only holds 900GB
13just like vi/emacs and pc/mac before it
ECHO
"You're temple containing such size within"
(;

Oh, mai.........:P
