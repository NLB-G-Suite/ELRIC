good MysteryPony might have a job by the end of the year
good MysteryPony might have a job by the end of the week
killerpony7733: seriously. "oh, the end to an amzing series that entertained gamers vor a decade with a simple basic recipe? let's fuck it up with a gameplay-experiment and throw all the answers we promised into the trash"
alexxm: your posts are going in twice
wow, I'm finally done with This day Aria, now I only need to get the right and left hand in sync at the end and then I can try to make a remix of the song :D... but not today ;)
Dark_Horst: oh, you mean ME3?
otakon i derped there

alexxm: Gratz dude! hope you get it
thanks MysteryPony
05this song is orgaaaaasmic
I'm also fully in the chat again :)
no stream?
otakon: naw. cnc. tiberium series
Dark_Horst yeah they just ruined everything so sad they won't make a remake that actually ends it correctly
ah
Dark_Horst: I was dissappointed when the FPS hybrid in that vein was canceled. It looked interesting
Wrek one orgasmic song for me is the C&C RA2 intro theme
So much metal
also any idea why my stream constantly refresh so many times?
otakon: that thing titled "Tiberium"? indeed a tragic fate. seriosuly, when i saw the screenshot of that soldier with the titan behind him, i was so hyped, i totally flipped my shit
Dark_Horst: well, I didn't flip my shit but it did look interesting.
otakon: next thing i read: " nope. we don wanna"
do some catgroove music

otakon: yup
Depressing_Rain: the re-up of it looks fun
oh yeah it does
Depressing_Rain: supposed to come out this fall
yeah i cant waiy
remake of xcom game... must have
wait*
Midnight_Tempest: I know man, I REALLY want it.
i exploded a thrid time when i heard about it
Midnight_Tempest: I'm honestly interested in the original, got the WHOLE collection for 5 bucks but goddammit I can't get the hang of the controls
apprently someones making a slender man movie
im back everypony!!!! miss me?
alexxm: Did you enjoy the drawing
Wb Panda-
hey Panda- what have you been up to
oh hey, Grinder
otakon: lol, yeah i havent bought the pack on steam yet... but i have a game that is just as good as the original, UFO Extraterrestrial... its bloody brilliant
|Discord| sorry my compeutor doesn't like deaviant art
one of may favourite tracks
alexxm: not much... just planning alot :D
Midnight_Tempest: yeah I've heard
Wrek ever tried a mass conscript assault with RA2? i remember being able to overrun a whole base with them they were pure rape trains though air could get them which is why you bring flak with them
what are you planning for Panda-
Herobrine and I are watching you don't turn your back
alexxm: oh... well... just a voice acting thingy xd
otakon: its kinda like the 'what if' game of the xcom universe... like what if the aliens had taken over earth in the first game instead of you fighting them off
Midnight_Tempest: ah, where can I get it?
05full conscript rape traisn has been a reliable strategy during WW2 aswell so xD
05should work in game too :P
Panda- : voice acting for what?
otakon: its on steam
Midnight_Tempest: danke
Cake is best pony!
mmmmmmm friendchips
Like fire, hellfire, this fire in my skin.
RainbowJack: >.> nada xD
Panda- : aahh
Wrek yup i always have a huge grin on my face when swarming a enemy base with them they just send a trillion bullets through a base :D
03http://mthruf.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/job-fails-now-these-ads-i-can-live-with.jpg
RainbowJack: when im done.. ill show you :D
otakon: oh the version on steam is the Gold edition, it comes with a built in mod pack that can make the game more playable for people that arent accustomed to that style of game... or you can make it more difficult if your a masochist...
ugh this food im eating is crappy :(
Panda- : okay
CCCP what are you eating?
/me slaps the crapy food out of CCCP's hand "NO!"
Anypony up to play a game?
what game
killerpony7733: some salad thing
Midnight_Tempest: wait, isn't it already a "Rocks fall, everyone dies" kind of game fro the start?
Barbetos: :D
i love salad
RA3 was still better then C&C 4 not RA2 but still a middle one between C&C 4 and RA2
wrek that said red alert 3
but its really bad salad
05Depressing_Rain: but i said i love RA2
ah i see
/me hugs Depressing_Rain!
well, i guess not. of to singleplayer with me.
i forgot what slash i use for the \me thing
AlienEd27 what games do you have?
/ use this one
otakon: yeah, but you can make it so your people and the aliens can take either less damage, or more... gain more experience from killing aliens, or less... the mod pack is actually really useful as it helps alot, the unmodded game is apparently ridiculously unforgiving...
ok
Midnight_Tempest: nice
/me hugs MysteryPony
Midnight_Tempest what game is this?
Wrek got some DX1 music?
/me is on fire
Barbetos: UFO Extraterrestrials
Killerpony7733 i have Minecraft, Terraria, magicka, TF2 (of course), Portal 2 and more
05now playign tiberian sun music
Barbetos: its kinda the spiritual successor to XCOM UFO Defence
so many games to browse trough 6_9
AlienEd27 Hm minecraft runs really bad and idunno about the others sorry :(
Killerpony7733 it's okay :)
Midnight_Tempest: Yeah... I have not played either, but don't yell at me I already get enough of it from my coworker who played it XD
does anybody want a finger ring?
:3
me
AlienEd27 if you want it to ping me just don't make the k a capital K
:D
/me gives Michael a Finger Ring!
Barbetos: well, its not a style of game for everyone... it takes alot of patience and time, being turn based and very, very tactical
killerpony7733 hehe, i'll remember that :D
/me puts the ring on his finger
Midnight_Tempest sounds like the kind of wet dreams I have.
Wrek do you have Deus ex 1 music? :$
I mean cream dreams. =P
Spike is legit.

Because, you know, time
FlareChaser|TF2: I see you're on TF2 :p
... But I've never had the ability to travel through time so I wouldn't know :S
Polydunami: id use it for travel and if i went back in time it would be for observations
What kind of observations, Bronysith? :3
Polydunami: the moon launch, important events through history
You mean crucifixion?
Goddamnit

Why is Denegoth never on when I need him the most.

And hey Polydunami, nice to see ya :3
and his resurrection
Polydunami: How's it going?
I'm doing fine
Bronysith how would it do that
Hey Bronysith, you'd have corroboration if you saw Jesus walking around three days after his death as well.

13was a hot day
Hai ThunderCloud

13one should always know where her towel is
^
hi MegaMoonShine
wrek is painting twilight while she reads, and he is slaughtering hellspawn? sounds legit
You have my brothers keyboard
exactly what Shizuka said
Shizuka whats that thing that your first monitor is ontop of?
Towels right next to me on me door.
You have my bacon.
Shizuka: one does not simply keep track of there towels
13killerpony7733: glorified power strip
I have my towel on the chair next to me :3
Shizuka ah

Barbetos: :o
Hello Dark_of_Max :)

Rain: im getting one soon mate
Polydunami is sleepy -__-
So the Desktop Ponies guys do special OCs too or are these edited by the Bronystate mods?
Shizuka: dat Neverwinter Nights...
13maybe it's just me but this doesn't look like hell
Is it supposed to be hell?
otakon: we need to figure out how to play DnD over online like desktop table style though
Species change
13diablo was always hell
/me hug breeeee
I need Wrek's oc in my desktop ponies, is what I meant, Bronysith
Diablo 3 is a different demon I thought.
Bronysith: they are coming out with something like that, but it's in beta atm
And now it's the High Heavens Shizuka
13that must be the core problem people have with it...
Diablo sorta wanted to invade. It happens.
otakon: i know. its gofing to be so awesome /)^3^(\
13just doesn't look like hell anymore
Wow that mob must be annoying Wrek.
You're practically in hell at the end of the previous act.
Bronysith: it has the potential to be
oh look diablo
Shizuka it kind of looks like the blood elf starter area, from WoW, to me to be honest.
/me pokes Airpuff
btw, Good afternoon everyone
Barbetos: This place?
TO HELL, AND ADVENTURE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
13welcome to DIE
Good day, TheGreatAndPowerfulT :3

MegaMoonShine Yeah. The resemblence is loosely there but i still see it.
hey TheGreatAndPowerfulT hows your day been
brb guys
/me makes a tomb at the bottom of the cliff for otakon "here lies otakon he had a beard and disliked shipping"
Barbetos: It reminds me more of the Vortex Pinnacle dungeon
Celestia is best pony :3

alexxm: one of the Prime Evils
alexxm A guy who shows up every now and then to rape gamers wallets. I mean...
Lord of Terror, one of the three Prime Evils of hell.
I don't think that is cannon.
I once knew most of the lore.
Sylandest1: the prime evil
These days I'm a bit rusty, been too long since I last looked into it. :P
thanks Sylandest1 and Barbetos
Bronysith: ahh, right. ty :$
Sylandest1: cause there were 3 then there was only 1

Nick, you are a 14Fearow.
seems like everyone is referencing angry birds these days
03in theory
03if you were to DRC everything a bazillion times
03would it all "even" out?
03like make the uh
2pm? time to cook bacon
03like the waveform look completely solid
03XD
Bye everypony :)
goodbye ACS13123!
bye ACS13123
why not just apply a ridiculous gain once?
03that too
03I tried with stuff like 100dB
03but yet it still didn't completely even out
03like when watching the FFT
03it still jumps up and down
Bronysith: does that say...with Chimmicherry sauce? :megusta:
Bye ACS13123
does the waveform look like a brick?
alexxm i picked blue eyes due to one of my eye colors green for my other which is the skin instead yellow marks due to it being a favorite color of mine and a black long mane due to my hair style and color :)
ACS13123: yes. yes it is
Bronysith: cooooooooool...
anyway BYE!
thanks killerpony7733
hay all my friends
hey guys. how is everyone?
03sorta
03lemme try it again XD
sagas lol guess i couldn't avoid that :D
and you
damn chat derp
don't
walk in awesome circles
Im doing pretty well Big_Macintosh_1992. How about you?
wat
http://i.imgur.com/6WAA7.png
that is all
pretty good sagas. just finished work
well, the FFT will still jump up &* down because it's still the orignal song
Oh where do you work Big_Macintosh_1992?
that;s Skylands's scpt, not mine
but if i actually had to make a actual OC i would include the actual eye color pattern my eyes have due to my heterochromia iridium
sagas: Coborns Grocery Store
Panda-: I'm cooking bacon! that is all you missed.
i want some
oh
right
sorry
you're applying modifications 2 the time domain
Big_Macintosh_1992: Never heard of it. Is it just local or a chain?
LOL
sagas: its a chain
ghen my hands are frozen, lemme warm them up
/me is watching The Legend of Korra
orly
03you know what's funny?
which episodes
sagas: is awesome
03I just did a hard limiter of 150dB to this song
*episode
03and it still sounds decent
Panda-: I don't think you can :I
Big_Macintosh_1992: Sounds good
03also, does it make any difference if you change the "seek" time from 7ms to something else?
Om: email me some?
Panda-: E-mail you bacon?
Om: yes :D
seems legit
Om: i just emailed u some strips
Bronysith: I personally like the 11th doctor more
Panda-: You just want my e-mail >.>
Bronysith: And you don't know it.
sagas: GTFO
sagas: im still on the 9th dr. i still need to see the 11th and 4th
sagas: i mean 10th
Om: what? no! you can use what ever email you want
prince-lemon: Holy shit! your not a bot?
all doctors are best doctor?
sagas: le-fail
Lawl
Panda-: I know what you are up to.
Om... look... im not up to anyting :(
mooooodead
prince-lemon: Well you never speak except to post new EqDaily posts
Been busy
I will stand behind my prefference for the 11th doctor
There is no 11th Doctor
if you want the song to look like a brick in the FFT, you nd2 apply modifications to the frequency domain
sagas: he doesnt like the 11th one bit
The last Doctor was number 10
:o
sagas: i havent seen the 11th doctor. so far only the 9th doctor. i still want to see the 4th and 10th
prince-lemon: is the 4th dr any good?
, like a multiband compressor (A3 has one). these are commonly used by studios to jack up the volume of the songs another way
03well
03I noticed that with songs like
0399 Red Balloons
chat
03even using hard limiting, the beginning & end parts still sound quieter
prince-lemon: Whats with the hate for Matt Smith?
I also have something which limits the FFT so that it looks like a brick. Trust me, that sounds REALLY crap.
is
03so I wonder how radio stations do it
Panda-: I know just pullin your leg xD
sligthly
4th is probably the most popular out of the old Who Doctors
dead
AGC/riding
Om: oh ^^ hehe
prince-lemon: what do you think of the 9th dr?
nter> also, does it make any difference if you change the "seek" time from 7ms to something else? < do you mena lookahead?
sagas: Nah, I've textwalled why I hate him so many times before
:P
Wrek: ALL THE BUTTON MASHIN
9th is good
Brb, gonna play Torchlight(no casz for diablo:()
03yeah
prince-lemon: oh I never see any of them
*cash
03and well
03can you do AGC in a DAW?
prince-lemon: Like I said, I always thought you were a bot
yes-ish]
03song still sounds fairly OK LOL
Yeah, probably last time I ranted about it was a while ago
prince-lemon: recommend the best Doctors.
prince-lemon isnt a bot?
\lolwut
03yep
/me f2k Sinon - November 26 Ogata Rina - Cocktail light Mix (2chFLAC@852kbps, 27.27mb/4:27)

prince-lemon: opr should i just watch it from 1st doctor?
03that's how fricking awesome those masters are
/me runs
03I'm sure the album version would sound like utter crap
I haven't really seen any other than 9/10/11
Panda-: Apparently not I just learned
prince-lemon: whos ur fav of those three then?
10th
prince-lemon: same here
Wrek quick question do you take commissions?
03LOL the results of fade-outs
So much man-love for 10th
Because MOTHERFUCKING TENNANT
prince-lemon: Ive only seen the 9th 10th and 11th
prince-lemon: but I still prefer the 11th
prince-lemon: i gotta finish the 9th dr before. i cant wait to see the 10th
hiya prince-lemon
Silly, there's no 11th.
prince-lemon: Tennant is a close 2nd
:P
whee
prince-lemon: how are ya today man? Also, MATT SMITH OWNS YOU!
Ohai otakhan
prince-lemon: just like how theres only the OT of star wars?
no, square waves are the loudest
Exactly
03generally I'll make 1kHz beeps at like, 1/4 volume and it still sounds loud
03hm
prince-lemon: MATT SMITH FTW!
And how the Matrix isn't a trillogy
:>
03but sine waves are close?
trilogy*
prince-lemon: lol
03I mean, a sine wave will be louder than any "natural" music, right?
Denial never makes things better, prince-lemon
dead ?
prince-lemon: or how theres no 13 in final fantasy
well, depending on how you do the loudness
Denial? I deny nothing. :>
I also enjoyed the MAtrix sequals
sagas: what about the star wars prequels?
That just fits with your like of other inferior things. :P
/me prepares lightsaber
03LOL.
03so I made a 1kHz square wave
03>goes in the red already
prince-lemon: They arent as good as the first, but I still enjoyed them
sagas: answer carefully
sagas: word your next few sentences carefully. they may be your last
sagas: now tell me. what do you think of the horrible fanfiction that is the star wars prequels?
Sumica: hey, which Aliens movie is showing tonight?
03oh my god
03square wave sounds horrible compared to sine wave
triangle waves are inbetween
03well
03Audacity only does square, sine, sawtooth
Bronysith: They werent as good as the original trilogy, but I was still able to enjoy them. Nowhere near as good as expected
03sine sounds the best
sagas: hmmmm
031kHz sine wave is what radios use to blip swearing AFAICT
generate sine, triangle, and square waves in A3 and look at the FFT
Wrek: What are those three things exactly?
sine has one harmonic, square waves have many more
hence it sounds louder for a particular peak/amplitude
sagas: the lightsaber battles in the prequels were terrible. they were more like dancing then actual fighgting
03hm
03I think sawtooth is what you mean by triangle?
no
dari, what you doing here? You should be with Olly or Nailbait.
Bronysith: have mercy on the poor guy, sagas doesnt know what he knows xD
now i go and eat delicoius dinner
Haven't seen Olly today
saw is kinda like a skewed triangle
/me drags sagas into the overns
03http://i.imgur.com/whDpN.png
And dunno where Nail is either
triangle is symmetric
BRB EVERYPONY
Wrek: Sweet celestia those bastards are tough.

dari well Olly literally just got on skype
Oh, hah
03but I want rollercoaster!
/me apparently cant enjoy sequals that werent as good as there previouse counterparts, but can still be enjoyed
/me runs
draw your own (r)
/me on principle
Iron_Edge most enemies with vampire abilities on higher diffculties
03well
03that would just be a sine wave with varying amplitutes, right?
03*d
You should have been there sagas
dead
When I deleted all the Matt Smith episodes live on steram
stream*
It was a good day
prince-lemon: lol
prince-lemon: been there for what? What happened?
prince-lemon: it was a good day indeed
there are some programs which allow you to draw waves yourself, but if you want to make something audiable which lasts for more than 1ms, itll take aaages if you draw the whole thing manually
And there was much rejoicing
when was prince-lemon
03...LMAO
03this preset in CEP
maybe 1sine + 1sine of higher frequency?
03called "out of control"
killerpony7733: I want Diablo 3 so bad. But I am short on funds. Regardless I enjoy watching Wrek play.
03funniest FFT ever
i boosted this song in A5 rite?
/me f2k Sinon - November 26 Ogata Rina - Cocktail light Mix (2chFLAC@852kbps, 27.27mb/4:27)
with 50dB boost in limiter, i can hear the cymbals pumping & not very nice
03Haha this is hilarious
03the FFT looks like some jello
/me is still waiting to be informed on what he missed
I already said
03I am far more amused than I should be XD
otakon: who is matt smith?
press alt X, does something come up?
Oh nvm
03you mean FFT?
Panda- 11th doctor
That is just offensive, prince-lemon
Panda-: the 11th Doctor, but prince-lemon hate's him so.
03I'm using CEP, not A5
no, i said alt X, not alt Z
alexxm: is there something wrong with him?
Panda-: A yeasty codpiece
i know
03wtf is alt x
03it doesn't do anything
otakon why does prince-lemon hate him?
ok
prince-lemon: just bc YOU don't like him doesn't mean everyone does
You are defying and denying 2 seasons of Dr. Who, prince-lemon
Panda-: no idea, ask him.
Panda-: Because he's bad.
in A3 it brings up a phase vectorscope
Offensive, offensive is what he's done to a show that enjoyed
03well
sagas: he'd rather do that then admit THE TRUTH
A4 doensn't have
I*
prince-lemon: you should do a rant on lYoutube about Matt Smith
03go in A3 and do generate - wave, set to 1000Hz base, 30 seconds, "out of control"
03and play it
prince-lemon: well.. i have never seen it... so i wouldnt know....
03fricking hilarious
2!pokemon
Ran, you are a Starly.

2Hnngh
02Well, Nini everyone~
otakon: *truth
2Goodnight Ray!
dat ruth
THE ALMIGHTY RUTH!
Well I'm off, guys. Cya!
The fact that Matt Smith's Doctor is actually a middle aged woman called Ruth
bye MegaMoonShine take care
sagas: He's the only 11th Doctor. That automatically makes him the best and the worst 11th Doctor.
14night Ray :3
Matt Smith can't be considered a Doctor until he's had some acting lessons
:P
Kammerjunk: according to prince-lemon, there is no 11th doctor
And I concur.

Wrek why not rend?
prince-lemon: So how many episodes of the 11th doctor have you actually watched? Oh and I fucking hate the 10ths companion
I dunno, not amount of money could convince me to have to look at his ugly face.
It bleeds them
no*
I just don't like him in general. His entire way of being just doesn't sit with me.
brb guys, bathroom
dari what if he was dead?

11th, I watched 1 or2 series of him

03well
03are your laptop keys the kind that can easily pry off? :P
03with mine, I can just pull each key off, clean under it, stick it back on
10I tried vacuuming once, that led to one of the function keys getting sucked up
03but the ones that are macbook-like keys don't work that way
03LOL.
XD
10We had to tear open the bag and find it
oh my gosh, that's hilarious
Damn the chat is going slow :D
03woah
macbook style keys are really annoying
Wallor?
ll
/me was discussing anime in another channel
*o
Pasta
*lol
Let me speed it up FASTER CHAT FASTER
… XD
Pie.
03I finished Code Geass
at least partially
03and am majorly disappointed
What's wallor mean?
I like pie.
O: was it- okay
03with how they ended the series
03:(
I was going to ask if it was good but I guess not
Had that once life was hard
03LOL
03well
03given the comment you left to that picture I sahred
03I was under the impression that you had seen it
Only parts
03ah
And the first episode
03the first season is good
03second season is good until the end
03>_>
/me pours caffine into the chat
Oh, that sucks.
03I mean, it was a logical way to end the series, it was just sad
03and I didn't like it
03:P
03I won't say more as >spoilers
Ypu can tp
… .n.
okay
XD
03got any recommendations?
03I want another series to watch
But apparently the regen on that class is mental.
Hmm
03requirements: It must have an English dub
I'm not sure what your interests are
03Preferrably not very long
Uh
03someone recommended Case Closed and I was like LOL NOPE
03300+ episodes, no thank you
I was told that Rurouni Kenshin was good, but I don't know
Case Closed is
good
/me 11,01cleans Petrified_Discord
but the episodes are usually quite stand-alone if the mystery's understood
I feel like my eyes are gonna sink back into my sockets I've been driving so long O_O
I'm sorry to have worried you!
unless it's like a special episode where two are one
03that's what my friend said
/me feels clean
03but I'd rather just sit down and watch a series
03since both of them are doable in a day :P
03each, not toal
03*total
Hmm, 95 episodes
Ah, okay
XD
Hello everypony

I don't know; I haven't watched it
03someone from #P-O is in Japan now
03for a while
03studying abroad
But I was told the English dub was really good
… O: That's so cool
You should put all your money in a chest in a dungeon. No one will ever take it that way! Oh, and don't lock the chest. That's just silly.
03yeah
03English dub of Geass was also good
XD
Death Note?
Wrek why not stach the gems and mats?
03actually that one sounded interesting
03how long is that series though?
Stach? As in moustache?
1336 episodes I think
Moustache the gems.
03welcome to the conversation
We moustache the gems
03and hm

Hit it with a hammer, that usually works.
Obsidian: hello, my brony brother

Hammer is best exorcism

Okay, who spat in my raisin bowl?
IMissOsamaBrony dat emote spawm
12yeah there's 2 out so far
otakon: what?
Diablo has the greatest moobs in the world.
spam*
I'll be back. gona play some Max Payne before the movie comes on.
demonboobs
IMissOsamaBrony: dont spam emotes or the mods will smite you!
Tax: moobs like Jagger
Tax: nope, actual boobs. the host he possessed was a woman
otakon: is Diablo a woman?
12they seem to be sticking to the visual novel side too
12for the manga
killerpony7733: i like ponys. :)6_9
What is the shotgun called on After the Flash: Sandstorm?
Tax His vessel is
So no.
Tax: enope, well he's not really gendered but is usually referred to as a "him"
IMissOsamaBrony you may do but its techinally emote spam :D
otakon: moobs then.
/me just learned of the awesomeness that is Hammerfall
bye errypony, imma go play tf2
IMissOsamaBrony: Ponies*
Tax: THE BODY HE POSSESSED IS A WOMAN THEREFORE HE HAS BOOBS
Tax: Diablo is a demon, they don't have gender i think
Later IMissOsamaBrony
IMissOsamaBrony: But youll miss the movie!
:'( killerpony7733
Tax: he has boobs and THAT is why the the fanart of him horrifies me so...
otakon not real ones though but his body is feminine :D
/me searches for NommyDash
otakon: he's a dude, therefore moobs.
so sue my pony :D
03> https://club.nintendo.com/rewards-details/a/22007.do
03> do I want to get one of these?
03I need to spend almost 400 "coins" before the end of this month because stupid Nintendo makes them expire
Seriously, HOW THE HELL ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BEAT THIS JACKASS?
Im gonna say Diablo has pecks
Who ate my raisins?
03and most of the rewards are stupid crap I have no interest in
):<
IMissOsamaBrony it's actually a rule here to not spam alot of emotes is considered spamming :$
otakon: with a hammer!
Well so far beating him with a hammer seems to be working. Albeit slowly.
12k so why does club nintendo for usa have awesome stuff
03wait
03awesome what
03I mean
otakon:Lots of time and click spamming.
03I hate most of it xD
Last I checked Diablo had 1/6 health. What the hell happened?
SirGanjalf: I didn't ask.
he's launching fireballs, picks you up, FIRES A GODDAMN "I'MMA CHARGIN' MA LAZOR" DEAL AND THE FUCK KNOW WHAT ELSE?
12well a better selection
sagas: Realms
sagas: he's a boss, second wind/form.
sagas: They moved onto another stage of the fight.
BTW: :D, excuuuse me
okay
Well looks like he spawns void zones.
sagas: He beat his shadow clone
SirGanjalf: No probs.
otakon: he only grabs you if he is able to stun you
What difficulty is this?
Those cages don't react very well, and the bolts falling from the sky probably hurt.
Wrek, PM please music =3
03like what
So what sorta percentage does Wrek have at succeeding in this fight?
05see? the earthquake is bollocks cause he just jump out of it, berserker with 100% bonus dmg is way more controllable therefore better
03because I'd totally get you something,t hat's low little I care about those rewards xD
Bronystate chat's topic is wrong
Anypony want some raisons?
Wrek: fury incarnate ftw
vordox: looks like nightmare difficulty to me
Cause it is Bon Jovi the GOD of METAL! Or Pophip...
12Nooo doood get the t-shirt
12LOL
well sagas with 2 healing pools...and a healing ability...id say a good chance
HIYA everypony btw
Evenprime: Why is he only at that stage? O.o
Hello Bronysith
Damnit prince-lemon! Changing the chat description is going too far! The 11th Doctor is better!
I didn't get any of that other than "he just jump out of it"

Aloha
vordox: maybe a new character or something. He isn't lvl 60 yet, so he can't be playing for too long with it
.....................
05rweadign chat at the same time is hard xD

WindWhistler: chat problems.
GabeMoist: How did you know...

/me gives sagas a cracker
12LOL nice @ Nick
Whatever, I'll just go back to playing then...
Enjoy.
03Coke rewards, every year they're like "oh btw guys, we're not doing these anymore after this year" and then they're like "LOL JK we've extended it"
Wrek: STOP STANDING IN FIRE :p
03prolly at least 5 years in a row now XD
12I was just thinking I might get the mario figure set thing
Dat hammering.

Victory!
/me nibbles on the cracker that Chains gave him like a mouse
Doesn't he drop anything?

12or something stupid
SirGanjalf: And 5 expansions

03<Nick> except a snes wii controller which would go nice with my link to the past game I dl'd but its 7000 points :\ <- buy it on ebay

Black soulstone isn't destroyed it just falls with diablo so lol
03I have one of those, imported from Japan
"Forever" XD
|Discord|: I thought you would look like Discord.
there are a few mediocre dub BD rippers
Everyone notice the soul stone
:'(
Poor Diablo
Cinematics look nice.
Chains: That is just cheap
So wait if Diablo is dead who is going to keep hell in order?
Spriggals: ...Shit.
|Discord|: What did you expect?
Chains: But i do have his mane
|Discord|: Yes and it is great, Maxwell! Good on you for finally doing it!
You KNOW what's going to happen, ANGEL BETRAYS HUMANS(Diablo 49
Discord doesn't have a mane, |Discord|.

panda: Really? If you say so I'll just have to belive you...:(
WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
For never has there been a tale of greater blow, than of Blizzard Entertainment, and its Diablo....~

Nittany_Discord: awesome zergs for the win
SirGanjalf: Demon gonna demons

Hello Diablo 3
/me hugs CCCP
/me gives Om a cracker
BroKnee: look on the home page...theres a pic from when kirz and a few others played
/me gives panda a cracker
Om... i had no idea you had an emotional side :)
/me huggles panda :D

I'm uber close to being able to make the staff and go there myself xD
CriticKitten: Well then that is just lazy story writing
/me gives BroKnee a cracker
Obviously killing him doesn't purge the world of evil. :p
panda: Correct, you win my contempt.
Allo everypony.
*nomz the cracker in the corner of the room*
CriticKitten: nope.avi you have to do it all over again
Hi Meanwhile
Hello Meanwhile

Chains: wy craccker wy not grass that stuff is the best
Meanwhile: wry you a person

Meanwhile: stop starting man stop startin
panda: lol
Oh no, don't get me wrong, his return in Diablo 2 is legitimately shocking, albeit a bit hard to buy....

Shamroc: Dont be a slag! :D
Harrumph Harrumph
It actively screws D2's continuity in the bum. ;P
03LOL what?
Bar Brawl!
10He's voice chatting me
10:P
sagas: yes. But it's their fault for naming the game "Diablo" isntead of "demon hunting" or something. XD
...
03that's fairly random.
Does this f:Ok you?
10Yep
They have to live with that
/me gives sagas a high five.
03y people no ask me
CriticKitten: the entire plot to diablo is to murder hellspawn to death. thats it
10He offered
Meanwhile: is best pony ever
Bronysith, Shamroc, you startin'?
Bronysith: Not quite
Evenprime: Well they could go after a different demon or something and name it after them
10since he finally got around to accepting my Skype request after how many months now?
/me gives cow334 a handful of grass
Bronysith: And to kill Diablo....3 times

Meanwhile..oy stop starting...start stopin the starting of the stoping...ya slag
CCCP: No its the truth im telling you!
/me chews Chimew
The first game features a lot of minor hellspawn with Diablo at the end. THe second has you kill Diablo and his bros. Diablo 3 is a belated attempt to clean up the leftovers of the first two games and ham-handed resurrects Diablo again despite this being impossible. >.>
:o
/me is shocked
hi guys
CCCP cant argue dat logic :=

Huzza for aliens!;)
Chains: ohhh then here you go have a chain that can go as long as you want it whohoo
Wrek: thanks for the stream!
Wrek: Thank you sir thank you. <3
/me glomps VioletVanilla
02Drf, just who I wanted to see
Its time for Aliens's ..... or aliens 3 for that matter
02I have a question
Wrek: have fun
Wrek it was a good and long stream
03OK
PMMM RA V1-3 BDs also on nyaa
06Grüße Gott Meanwhile~ <3
how long is alien 3 (runtime) roughly?
03RA?
Bronysith: It's a good game, but the plot is trash. And saying "it doesn't need a plot" is precisely why AAA gaming is allowed to get away with murder. Because you let them charge you 60 bucks for a 20 dollar experience and then make excuses for them. >_>
Region A
03wait
03volume 3? It's finished now?
02Do you have any idea what would be a good laptop for under $800?
I'm sorry I couldn't give you a cracker, CriticKitten, I ran out. *Eats my third cracker* I thought there was enough for 1 each.
10Shishi!
03uh
apppppparently so
02When I look at laptops and it gives me all this information I can't tell if it's good or bad
hey is alien on tonight
03well I don't really want to look right now :/
02Hey Sky.
03LOL
03well
CriticKitten: well, Dragon's Dogma has a lousy, preachy plot but the gameplay is grea
Story/plot is very important!
03did you have any specific places you had to order from etc?
Diglett: nope, it's Alien3
Pfft alien's are not real even do I see them take away my family an the farm land every day and the only thing i can say is ..... Moo
/me gives otakon a traffic light
02Nope, anywhere is fine
Its Alien 3
03k
/me was checking out Best Buy atm
CriticKitten: In my opinion Diablo 3 has been at least a $100 experiance, I can't stop playin the dang thing xD
otakon: True, but Dragon's Dogma has other flaws that kill it as a game.
Chains: huh? what's this for?
03oh god
So on a scale of 1 to 10, how bad is Alien3?
03avoid them at all costs LOL
/me is now passing out random things because I ran out of crackers
CriticKitten: the CONSTANT BACKTRACKING sadly comes to mind
CriticKitten: yea i worded that wrong. i just never cared for the plot to diablo man. and yes. the plots to AAA games are terrible because of graphics and focus on making a single player game multiplayer. its all bullshit
Chains xD
otakon: I knew that
/me eats his cracker
02Ok XD
*Hugglez Chains*
BroKnee: That's another thing that bugs me. Hours don't translate to monetary value,.
03well
*.
03they just charge way too much
/me gives Diglett an NYC Taxi's trunk door
03what I had my sister do
03go to Best Buy, try the models out, find one you like, buy elsewhere for less :P
Mfw I get pinged by the word "taxi" ¬_¬
/me crash glomps into Sumica
Sumica: how are you now?
Yay
daww look at them ponys
I see ponies on the stream :)
yay
02LOL
I've played games that I can say I got hundreds of hours from, but I'd never say I got hundreds of dollars out of them. :p
CriticKitten: In your opinion it doesn't, in ALOT of other peoples opinions, yea, it does.
I fucking love that wallpaper! Anyone have a link to it?
/me 11,01hugs Sumi
Filly ponies are best ponies
and now you get this if you order more than $50 from we love fine lol http://derpy.me/kuyas
Hello everypony :)
Ow my ears.

Oh. Joy.
Shamroc: Ikr, I can't believe the movie's startin'. What a slag.

02Is HP any good?
OH, there's ponies in the foreground
Hi Zappy

And then Aliens.
Ugh, now there's more ponies I have to give crackers to >_< (But I ran out of crackers so I'm giving out random objects O_o)
wait, do I see a pony audience on the stream?
Shamroc: The movies mum is a right slag, needs to stop startin'.
03they're literally the same specs as Acer, but $200-300 more
Darf14: Yes
Egg out of friggin' nowhere
O_O
I wonder why the Gamecube didn't Cube all their games like the N64 64'd all their games.
yes darf14
Going to watch 5 first min for that is what i have never seen before
Yay metaphorical oral face rape!
Fluttershy is freaking out
Bronysith: what is that
didn't we watch this movie yesterday?
Tovler: Because that wouldn't sound as cool.
/me gives DocShane a wooden door
sagas: What did you think of the picture?
Randomly killing a little girl; that's what I want to see at the start of a movie
hugs sagas back
cow334: dr who!
11,01Yet another face hugger. They sure do love faces.
Meanwhile: alieans need to stop starting..
Bronysith: ohh okay
Face huggers are best ponies
DocSane: hi
WHO HAVEN'T I GIVEN A CRACKER TO?
I have to admit, the pony audience reminds me of MST3000 :)
Nittany_Discord: its like the ultimate deep throat
CCCP: hey there
Good evening Bronystate!
02I have to ask then, how cheap is "cheap"?
Chains: me
Nittany_Discord well they would not be call face hugger, if they liked crotch for example.
Chains me
hi Fleta
CCCP: That was Aliens this is Alien 3
Hi Fleta
Evening
hi Fleta
Hello Fleta !
03prolly below $500
hello Fleta
03I dunno
|Discord|: I told you! I liked it, Maxwell!
02Aight
Twilight is pointing out all the scientific fallacies made in the movie
Bronysith: Yes I have! Don't try that on me!
03I haven't shopped for laptops in a while
mwahahahaha i live
Hi Fleta
Obsidian: oh thanks :)
Proceed to undo happy ending of previous movie in three... two... one...
CriticKitten: But Alien 3 has, and its the best movie… of… the...
/me glomps Fleta
hai Meanwhile , look what you could get if you spend $50 on welovefine :p http://www.welovefine.com/img/cms/gifts/mustache.jpg
Shamroc: Aliens need to start stoppin'
03but if you can spend $800, definitely try to stick to that. Like really, the more the better
Barbetos i would laugh if they were called crotch huggers
03ideally you want one with a dedicated video card
sagas: You did?
/me is glomped by Bronysith :D
03most of the cheaper ones have onboard cards
is this aliens 3
Is this the extended version?
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Why would I need that? I could just scan mine and print it for the same effect.
03because unlike desktops, you can't really upgrade the graphics in a laptop :/
Meanwhile: them aliens are slags...so are their mums...and need to stop starting..
Midnight_Fyre: all versions are the extended versions of everything
This this .... is actually a pretty good movie
/me slaps Chains
cow334: No. It really isn't.
OW
yay
Large middle finger to audience who cared about the crew intiated in t-minus 10 seconds
I haven't seen this in a long time
/me punches Bronysith
|Discord|: Yes! Its unique and original to you, making it better than one made in a pony creator
Meanwhile reasons, idk :p
DocSane: well I like it
11,01Let's go outside, into the cold.
David Fincher directed this? Nice
Spaaaaace
In space, no one can hear you scream about the quality of your film~
Makes me wanna watch Se7en :D
Nittany_Discord: The cold of space!
SO I missed the begging what happened?
Sumica: ponies i way of word!
cow334: Afraid I can't do anything to help you with that.
Shamroc: you do need to stop startin'. And them aliens are slags.
SPAAAACE
/me gives Jim a car bumper
What century?
the moon
I just noticed the MST3K Ponies! :)
^
Gray sky is bland
Chains: But why do I need a car bumper?
11,01Those ponies are in the way TBH.
reminds me of Dayz
Meanwhile.stop starting ye slag.....
did the ocean shrink?
Jim: Idk. I ran out of crackers to hand out.
RustyMeat: Face hugger appeared from nowhere, screwed up the SUlaco, caused stasis pods to be ejected.
DocSane: umm.. I don't really understand were you're getting to
man, earth is kinda of a grabage dump in the future
theirs ponys on the screen cool
Shamroc: You started startin' ye slag.
Nittany_Discord: Agreed. I couldn't read the intro
02Right
Nittany_Discord: muffin? would you like one?
Did Earth downgrade itself after the second movie
Darf14: Earth is kind of a garbage dump at the moment
Facehugger is that smart?
03typically you CAN add more memory and a bigger hard drive, so those are less important.
Meanwhile: nah ye started the startin of the starting....ye slag
dem ponies
True
Jim: /)
02Which is why I'm buying a new laptop lol
03Processor and video is what you want to look for
Darf14 : Yeah, and this is former Disneyland too O.o
(\
dat ass?
03memory's cheap and you can just add it later :P
Jackpot!
Distortion you have no idea
/me gives Distortion the S.S. Titanic
are you sure this is eath
Inception?
This is not Earth.
not earth
delicious
When was this movie released?
Falloutception
It's a prison colony.
Haha he had dodo on him just kidding
oh its not? My mistake
03just because I hate exclusives
03enjoy :P
But it was filmed on earth. I can see where the confusion lies/
CCCP : 1992
/me gives Darf14 a butter knife
I like big ships. Thanks Chains:)
That previous planet made it look like Earth
NOAW!!
Fleta: tanks ^_^
Planet of the Lice
02Auughh downloading zips
Well his eyelid just moved, so if he's supposed to be dead....
Live you douche!
CCCP : Armored personal carriers :D :D :D
/me doesnt understand the context since he hasnt seen the previouse 2
lol DocSane
That's not how you talk...
is that tywin from GoT?
DED
/me shocks Meanwhile
Yay a butter Knife! Now those butter enemies wont stand a chance against me!
Fleta: :D
/me is toasty.
/me gives ROHKARA a lock of RD's mane
She was just faking long enough to spit at him.
03that's how they are on Nintendo's site
/me nuzzles Bronysith
moo
Those silohuettes
Space Caribou
03I literally just downloaded the files and uploaded them.
Brahmins!
03wasted 30 coins on those
/me curls around CCCP
/me gives RustyMeat a car alarm
:D
03screensavers are dumb anyway but I figured people might want them
/me puts butter on Meanwhile ... mmmmm toast....
waht happend to newt
CCCP i'm eating strawberries with milk and sugar like a boss :)
Only one survivor, Lt Ripley. Believe it or not,.
nice angle
I spy with my little eye.
00,10odd, her cloting was grey before.
/me bonks Fleta in the head with a cinderblock.
Does Promethius use those same greenscreen computers that all the rest of the movies have used so far?
Who even uses Fallout-ish computers in the future?
/me gives Fleta a pair of pants
killerpony7733: aweome! /)
02Oh wait so like...ohh
Chains: oh here i didnt want my cracker so can just go and give it to someone else
newt be dead
03hm>?
she dead
10 yas old?
Hicks, Newt, Bishop. Dead.
Ripley really doesn't like human men. She only cared about the cat in the first movie and the little girl in the second.:|
02For some reason I was thinking of screenshot LOL
Shamroc: super ded
Newt? Nooooooooo
was that her
03LOL
aww :( That's sad
Who wants the last cracker?
Bishop is just off actually.
debug: eeyup
Chains: ME!
Jim: Well, Fallout is set in quite distant future as well
It was at this moment that I knew I'd hate this movie
I spy with my little eye somthing white
/me 2shinypounces
11,01I feel like these Alien movies weren't meant to have sequels.
No, sagas! No seconds!
Spriggals: the text wall?
Didn't that ....just REMOVE everyrhing good about the Aleisn 2?
Nittany_Discord: Aliens was the only real sequel.
Yes
Correct
Vordox: EXACTLY!
Common sequal problem, destroying all continuity from the previous movie
Bullshit movie, you can't just kil off the girl because she refused to star in your crappy film. Come up with something better
Now we must watch A vs P!
Nittany_Discord: Thats why they stopped at 3
Nittany_Discord: probably not. is predator also made by ridley scott?
Nittany_Discord everyone always end up with being a kill fest
02All these numbers and letters I don't know what they mean .-.
It's David Fincher giving a middle finger to James Cameron.
/me ransprawls
I have to admit do part one was my favorite of aliens
Bronysith: No
Then you get this, which ruins the ending of the last one within ten minutes, and the [information redacted by galactic police]
DocSane: And to the audience
WHO WANTS THE LAST CRACKER?
Vordox : Yeah, why'd they bump off Newt and moot the awesome boss fight? :(
11,012 was good, but it ended well.
11,01And now they kill off the little girl and the android?
killerpony7733 and the final alien went to space
Give us strength, o Lord, to endure this film
/me hasnt seen any other Alien movie
Gods be mad
And Hicks.
Nittany_Discord: yeah but I likeed the ending of part one
God is PISSED!
Don't forget Cpl. Hicks
In next reboot cat that was saved by Ripley is infected.
Does God have to slap a pope?
And then God sends the Alien upon them
/me slaps Meanwhile
Luna controll?
Alein and Aliens are the best in the series, 3 is meh but Resurrectin should burn in heck
Eevee?
His voice is irtritating
47!
Hitman!
AGENT 47
Meanwhile is the pope?
03numbers and letters for what XD
lol
And now have some exposition that we already saw in the previous scene
BURN HER!!
rape
i think i remeber seeing this one
:|
A DUCK?
/me gives VioletVanilla the last cracker
Shes a witch!
Why is Lex Luthor on a space colony?
BURN HER
WITCH
She turned me into a newt!
02For the laptops
well, i'm gonna say allofdem is important
WEVE ALL TAKEN THE VOW!
/me smiles taking the cracker happily <3
Burn the WItch
Jim: a newt?
Bronysith: I got better...
if one unit is actuing as a bottleneck, it'll slow many things down
depending.
VioletVanilla: That was the last one *Wink*
03well yes
Jim: Do not speak of Newt. Too soon
03but you can upgrade the RA
03*RAM
SHes a violator of harmony!
Space Monks
ASA peee peeee
03you can't upgrade GPU
/me is sad that he didnt get Chains last cracker
te he
03etc
:#
Chains: how many crackers did you have?
ROHKARA: apace?
:(
ROHKARA: SPACE?!
if you don't game, that's OK
Boys club. Boys rule girls drool.
ROHKARA: spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace
00,10ohhi Vivi <3
i got a cab doo
/me eats the cracker
Aye Ass Aye Pee
ohai vivi
Looks like a boys club
door*
CCCP: I thought I had enough for everypony, but more ponies joined. So I handed out random stuff.
It's a prison.
02Mine might be for gaming too /cough
Chains: oh lol
03:P
/me hands Chains tea
03here hang on
03I'll look around for you
Merci.
03oh
03do you have a preference on screen size?
Gentlemen, you are an amorphous mass of bald Brtitish guys. You will all soon be dead, so don't bother with names or having personalities or anything.
03that's kinda something you can't change
03so I generally sort that first
If its a prison, why did they all take a vow of celebacy?
/me splashes the tea in my face
It's quite fine, yes.
Shots awaken the frozen
that sucks one girl and a bunch of dudes
What Seems legit DocSane:D
lol
So hes the Medic
/me wipes Chains face dry
lol
Hey guys
02As long as it's not like incredibly tiny. Like one of those noteboks or something. Otherwise I'm fine with anything.
03you mean netbooks?
Hi Arteza147
03and well, the two popular sizes are 13" and 15"
/me gives Arteza147 a lightbulb
Does that mean that they don't have the same special effects budget as the previous movie
03it's just a matter of personal prefernce really
03but for now I'll do the 15" ones since there's more of them
I'm back
they DIDN'T MAKE IT
wb otakon
HEYA
otakon: we missed you!
NEKKID
i wanna netbook that can rip DVD, preferrably BDs aswel
otakon: Nice timing.
all that shit and THEY DIED
wow, that sucks
Wb otakon :)
/me glomps otakon into the metal gear
NEKKID O_O
just go like that
ormaybe it would be chaeper to buy a netbook + optical drive?
go like that
Go nekkid, definately
Im supprise the robot didnt live
no, naked Ripley is good
Don't normal people talk like this?
ext or int+case
definitly stay naked
02That's fine by me XD
Ima go get more crackers brb
Darf14: he asked to be de-activated since he was so beat up.
what have i missed?
03woah
Arteza147: she just woke up
Put a hitler stash under her nose and shes good
Arteza147: the dr sent a nuke into london
03all these screens suck unless you spend at least $830 :<
ok.....never mind
For a guy who didn't have seen a woman in along time, he is pretty unimpressed
Like I asked, if its a prison, why did they take a vow of celebacy?
02D:
rofl.
03small resolution LOL
"How do you know my name"
"I read the tag in your pants"
sagas: Secret butt fun
03there are two types of laptop screens, standard res and high res
SirGanjalf: he's a psychopath...you know like Meanwhile
Meanwhile: magic!
03high res ones have sharper image etc
sagas: The prisoners all follow a weird religion of their own.
Arteza147: Ripley is the only survivor of her crew again.
otakon: oi.
Meanwhile: she needs to stop startin
/me pours Meanwhile a cup of Ear Grey, hot. "Here"
Obsidian: What about newt and david?
DocSane: That is a weird prison....
Arteza147: Dead
/me drives a Ford F-150 with top-mounted floodlights
nom
Hey kids! I'm back! how are all of you? :D
she got eaten
poor Newt
Obsidian: WEAK!
02And I'm guessing small resolution isn't as good XD
hai FlareChaser
03well it's "normal"
Hello FlareChaser
not newt
03Most laptops have a resolution of 1366x768
yeah....alien 3 made saving the girl completely pointless >_<
well at least she wasnt conciouse so it was painless
yeah, Newt
sagas: This is a bad movie. Stuff just is.
Oh hey, emotions.
Arteza147: Welcome to ALiens 3
no newt :(
03mine's got 1680x1050 on the same size screen, for reference
/me turns on some rap music and hydraulics
Melty.
Everyone's dead Dave.
/me crash glomps FlareChaser into a crater
Darf14: yeah it did, one of the reason I don't like this movie
acid, oh shi
ACID BURNS
/me dies
Melted :(
GET OUT! YOURE ALL GONNA DIE!
/me drives past everypony
02Ohh
Obsidian: Theyve already jumped the shark!
Bronysith: ...hey you want a strange razorback?
so the girl was saved just to have her die in the first minutes of the movie ?
Okay, now the movie just gets cruel to fans of the last movie.
I concur otakon
Yeah well the title of the film is "Alien3" If there weren't aliens it'd be random.
True enough
/me blows up Chains car
Why not just say the truth?
FlareChaser: nah
Chains: WOW nice ride man
Meanwhile: yeah true.
FUK U GAWDMAWDUR
FlareChaser: sure
I hate to be repeticiouse, but im gonna repeat myself anyways
FlareChaser: give it to me when u can!
She was my baby daddy~
She wants it to be a surprise when the aliens get out
Bronysith: WAITWAIT I want something
you know, make it fun.
It's more like this movie was made to completely invalidate the happy ending of the last one.
FlareChaser: wat?
She is exploding emotionally because she is not used to feeling emotions other than hissy fit:|
/me sagas steps in front of me like last time
But what about Mr. Joneees???
So what is the next trilogy we're gonna watch?
hey FlareChaser want 4 strange knives and 4 strange pistols?
Wow. A giant fuck you, right to the fans already!
SirGanjalf: Still on earth
Yup, she's dead alright.
Shamroc: I'm not sure ._.
/me instead of honking, I turn on my floodlights
03hm
DocSane: eeyup, and Sigourney did NOT want to be in this one either.
Hello girl who is obviously not Newt
Poor newt :( Im really feeling sry at this part for Ripley.
03this one actually looks really nice
03http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834230236
God that is just harsh.
tasteless movie, very tasteless
And it makes me sad too

OMG Its white! :O
03that's a quad core, 6GB of RAM and a dedicated graphics card

poor newt the buget cuts must of got her
Shamroc: I'll take 1 strange pistol..
lol
Arteza147: Hes kinda dead
Obsidian: So... Cat will live?
/me wonders if hes gonna have to teach Chains a lesson again
Arteza147: you mean Hicks? he got impaled, Bishop got shut down
Hello Paladin_Drakkenwolf
FlareChaser: WHAT DO YOU WANT!? DAMN IT
03can't find any Acers thare are similar, the only one aroujnd that price range has onboard graphics :/

Hit her with a cattle prod. That'll wake her up.
Arteza147: He was shut down by the crash. i.e. He broke.
02That's great :D
otakon: That doesn't lower the creepy factor, quite the opposite in fact
nah, it's actually a dual core with HT
Cant tell if Peod Bear or loves Corpses

We're off to a great start
/me turns my ultra-violet floodlights on, pointing them at sagas, but resists honking
What kinda contagion is 9 feet tall with razor sharp teeth?!
Sumica: bc she doesn't want ANYONE finding out about the Xenomprphs again
I don't understand. Movie hurting brain.
Sumica: cause they wont belive her...
UH oh cupcakes any one
FlareChaser: okay i will find something
00,10No Colora but i did find this xenomorph in her.
Sumica: No idea. She could just say they'd encountered an alien parasite.
sagas: the worst kind
Good :D
I spy with my little eye somfin red.
sagas: and two mouths
sagas : Cholera :D
/me gives cow334 a cupcake

02Wait, nevermind the Dell or the Asus?
Well, no cholera but I did find what looks like a dick with teeth.
Spriggals: Red Spy is in the base?!
Otakon: Oh. How long were they drifting this time?
Yes movie, just keep dragging this out.

Distortion: theres no doctor in tf2
Distortion: its a medic
Arteza147: Space Balls actually
Distortion: By putting a baboon heart in her. Sounds like a plan.
/me watches Chains speed off confused
I half expected Archimedes to pop out of her.
Bronysith: Heavy calls him Doktor as well.
otakon: That makes sense
otakon: Never seen it. Is it any good?
Bronysith: Unless you a timelord
You have NO idea...how much this hurts.
Arteza147: Spaceballs reference
Heres a hint, its not Lupus
Arteza147: hilarious

Meanwhile: now that makes sense actually
/me wonders about sagas as I continue making my PB & J, not acknowledging the laser
....I'm supposed to care for these guys? Cuz, I can't wait until they start dying'
They live in Space Austrailia. Think about it, Austrailia was originally a penal colony.

RivaLz: Well, its a cow.... BUT IN SPAAAAAAAACCCCCE!

Sumica: wait... I could have SWORN that a dog was infected not a cow...
Wait. Are they on the prison planet yet?
otakon: It is a dog.
If I found an unknown dead lifeform I wouldn't pick it up
/me shoots the glass of milk with a 50 cal bullet, destroying the glass, travels through the fridge, and through the wall
In the extended its a cow

DISCORD!!!!
Bronysith: O///O
Disharmony? DISCORD
Disharmony. Need ponies.

Use Elements of Harmony to resolve issue.
Bronysith: wat.

Its never worked before Arteza147

Where is Princess Celestia?
Actually, use them to solve any issue.

No disharmony here >> nope all good << >>
hey guys i heard some disharmony....your not in a cult of discord are you?

dat shit
my little alien i used to wander what creepy culd be my little alien until u stepped in front of me
otakon: That's a real nerdy complaint.
You are both prisoners and I expect some professionalism, dammit!
ok
Meanwhile: well, I guess that... but they could have went for more a bit I think
I'm going to raise my VOICE at a random interval to make myself sound more DRAMATIC
Meanwhile: look who's talking moostachio
Alien, y u no look like a cow?! Mooooo
oh my

I think a MLP and aliens crossover has already been done
bad move
I hate bad smells more than Xenomorhes
CriticKitten: LOUD NOISES
otakon didn't the original lacked those two "pipes" on the back?
Boners. Boners everywhere.
otakon: Ey, I 'aint nerdy. I'm icy chilled.

Ulthane: hmmm, goo point.
Ripley is the brony and they are all the non-bronies

Ripley is told to avoid parading around in front of prisoners.
Sumica: She already has bigger balls than the entire marine corp did.
What is the order of the ponies on the bottom?

Oh so you're a murderer and a rapist huh? No worries I'll just sit opposite you. :D
It was!
She ain't takin' yo shit
Arteza147: np! :)
Then Ripley proceeds to do a strip tease.
Ripley wants table friends damn it!
It's like they want us to root for the alien

Love and tolerate

I guess they all love and tollerate
^^
ROHKARA: You mean you arent?
The prisoners are all Bronies?
Tolerate the intolerable. This guy's a brony.
^^^^
ROHKARA: I feel the same way with the SAW series
Planet Austrailia has no room for Love. just tolerance.
otakon my theory: people are okay to watch people die, but dogs dying is unacceptable
Thats not a good sign
Meanwhile: he requires all the brohooves! ?)
To die duh!

Bronysith: Why yes. Yes he does. (\

Its the 3rd movie
oo, they're gonna have to glue you back together
And by affections, I mean sex
Notice they were having him act like the alien was a dog, even though in this version the dog has been replaced with a cow.
00,10gonna burry what's left of him in a soup can.
otakon: Then that means... we only have one more before.... RESURECTION...
GAME OER MAN!
I thought they were celebate
sagas: they got rid of that mechanic, they can only reproduce via Queen
Blaze: not showing that one.
There was no sign of a dog EVER in this version.
10I need to rewatch Yumekui Merry
Woof.
otakon: .....THAT....IS....AWESOME.
Alternate ending. Spike turns into good Ridley. Destroys the aliens and revives Newt with the power of friendship. They fly together to happy new adventures:)
Blaze, didn't you read the newsletter? There WERE ONLY THREE!
I'm convinced that this movie is a parody of Alien movies
DocSane: eeyup, so that whole "Spike?" scene was just pointless.
otakon: That breaks the continuity of the 3rd game then.
otakon: So is this movie only gonna be one Alien?
fraternizing
Yumekui Merry has dub now lol
10I don't do dubs
otakon: Awww, but Resurrection would be fun to mock. ;_;
sagas: No.
Wear a condom kids
I don't do alcohol

Mybe we should have given him more safety than a mop and a janitor uniform.
cow334: be prepared for days of fun
Finally got some MLP shirts :$

I still deny Alien 3 because of what happens to the characters from Aliens...
Awesome
brb guys
whats this movie?
Okay, everyone, here's a test: name a character aside from Ripley in this movie. Do you know who any of these people are?
08,01sagas: i *was* goign to name it Rainbow Dash, but that was too obvious
Its Alien 3
DocSane: Tywin Lannister
08,01i was also toying with "Cloud Kicker"
dem pony shadows :D
DocSane: Murphey, the Janitor
DocSane: Morpheus, Agent 47, Smitty
Morpheus is not in this movie.
nope i got nothin
Its clear, he wants to cut him in half
08,01Arteza147: because dinky is a unicorn
0700? WHY MILITARY TIME?
Black man who says he is Murderawr does that count DocSane.
Trust me, I'm the doctor
So hes The Doctor!
I just stepped away to get food. Who wants Ripley?
And notice, you can name actors, but not CHARACTER NAMES
DocSane: Ik, but he reminds me of him someway
lol he is a android
"Im a doctor not a Jailer"
DAMMIT JIM!!!
"A Doctor always pays his debts."
The company from last movie?
dat personal ediphication
08,01Arteza147: "DerpyCloud"
08,01that's quite funny
Cocoa_
?
08,01but i can't get away with it
Apparently, Weyland-Yutani is the ONLY company in the world of Alien
and you smell!
08,01anyway, i've just started it, so i can still change the name
"If you value your life, if you walue exsistance, there is one thing you do not put in a trap. Me"
I like this Doctor.
08,01i'm still considering changing it to Cloud Kicker
Man, I haven't gotten laid in 20 years. Stop cockblocking me!

Then just use DitzyCloud
08,01and having its logo as CK's cutie mark
*wink wink*

Get out of here stalker
GTFO Doctor!

How far in to the movie are we
Bishop!
Spectrum_Plush: I thought it was a cloud and a sun?

08,01"Swedish Spitfire"
This movie feels so out of place from the Alien franchise
08,01that's waht i'll call it
If I ever go to Britain, every time I see someone, I'll go up to them and ask, "Are you the Doctor?"
BISHOP!
Ohi Bishop

sagas: Nah, just given a right beating.
The alien thinks they're his birthday candles
"The black dude called me 'brother'. I'm in."

Carving knives. Great.
Ripley: pointing out plotholes since forever
Take on the Alien with a knife.
melee weapons, useless
Use a butter knife as a weapon

Or a spoon
Build a prison, do not carry weapons! Surely we are the best prison there is
Guns would make the fight too easy.
Nittany_Discord: That is a good Friday parrody
Best Line
Nittany it is? O+o
10:<
11,01It is.
only one thing can kill an alien a BASS CANNON!!!!!!

/me hugs SuperBrony64
Hello SuperBrony64
CCCP IS BACK!
Bronysith: Physcic paper is best pony
Bronysith: all you need is a bannana. Wonderful things bannanas
Mature movies are mature, as you can tell by their gratuitous use of 'fuck'
me hugs CCCP "tell us when you leave!"
how did ACTs go?
What happened on October 10th, 2010?
/me hugs sagas back :)
Right around...here.
11,02i liek cookies :3
/me was studying ACT today
02I fell asleep :'D
D"
Bronysith: Of course the 11th doctors
D:

i have poptarts
Bronysith: I have a fez :3
02Nah
oh
...
02I finished the parts with tons to spare
/me super glomps Jim
02Then fell asleep until the next part
Jim: GIMMEEE
10What section?
over 100 flashlights but no batteries Fail
Jim: Fezs unite for the 11th Doctor!
Jim: Oh you :). Do you have a mop on hand?
o-o
oh

http://www.welovefine.com/716-rainbow-run.html
And a bowtie too
sagas: Fezes unite!
Doors look flimsy
no. fuckin. way.
Everlasting_Joy: 9th or 10th doctor? which you like
Well, obviously we know what to do then. Stick someone in it and get them to make a lot of noise.
Yeah, thats what they said the last 2 movies
Except for the acid blood that can melt through everything
Does anypony read the asktinkertots blog?
R-Dash5000: ponies
Why dont they lock themselves in there with supplies and wait?
???
Bronysith: Amogst the two, 9th.
Litwick: whos that?
85. His IQ.
Tumblr pony.
lol
That would be easier sagas
Everlasting_Joy: and your personal fav overall?
looks cool on blue
He's a bit on the slow side.
HES AN ANDROID!!!!!
:3
Again, amongst 9 and 10, 9.
He's technically retarded.
Wait, wasn't someone called 19 there?
02Uhh English and Math
Any bored artists willing to help a small-size project out in there?
Everlasting_Joy: no i mean among all 10 or whatever doctors
I feel this plan will fail horribly
Ass
There are 11 doctors
yeah...it will be first pony swag item accuired by me
Because if you don't the Aliens going to EAT your ass.
Jim: thats why i said 10 or whatever
Do you really have to ask that dumbass? It wants to kill you all
Bronysith: I've only seen the new series, so only 9,10 or 11, and I have a hard time between 9 and 11.
DAMMIT JIM IM A DOCTOR, NOT A ________
I vote lock myself in with a lot of supplies
spend $50 and they will send you your own moustache
This plan will go flawlessly
Or, you know, suicide
Everlasting_Joy: ahh okay. yea i amm currently enjoying the 9th doctor
Spread flammable liquid everywhere, there light flares.
yeah i told my mom that...she was like *woopty doo* /sarcasm
Painting the floor :)
GRRRREEEEAAAAT plan.
The 10th is brilliant
Getting high is a bad thing now?
Bronysith: That's fantastic.
he's ded Jim
Why are they painting the tunnel?
He's not dead, he's just regenerated
*Explodes*
Why isn't the alien attacking while they prepare
Bronysith: Get to the 11th. He is best
This is TOTALLY going to work
11,01So, what are they spreading everywhere?
i would put a lampshade on my head and stand still in one spot
They're painting it with flammable liquid.
Nittany_Discord: Explosive.
Hat: Digestion?
Hat, because that would make too much sense.
Mop water?
Nittany_Discord: Flammable liquid
sagas: ill be the judge of that mister guy who actually likes the star wars prequels
I like the 10th doctor
Nittany_Discord: Burning stuff
and i now found a derpy beanie...also want
Bronysith: Haters gonna Hate
11,01K.
sagas: ponies gonna pwn
no
remeber what?
Bronysith: Which episode are you on?
GOt it Memorized
leave it
He lost his sonic screwdriver!
Smoking while painting flamable liquid
Very smart
Everlasting_Joy: ep 7 the long game
or a light saber
nvm get it and gtfo
ded
We have to go deeper
REally...
use the force man
look up
he could just get down another step
DED
ded
That flashlight gets the best scene
ded
MY HIGHLY FLAMMABLE FLARE! NOOOOO!!!!!
Oh shit.
Bronysith: I feel the prequals were entertaining in there own regard. Put the hype aside and they were pretty decent
lolhai
SUp
ouch
ded
11,02So, what's new with everypony? :3
Woah that was completely a surprise!
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
11,01He's just helping him up.
sagas: they completely destroyed star wars lore
SuperBrony64: It ate everyone.
SuperBrony64: im geting pony swag
slowmoooooooooooooooooo
SuperBrony64: Ya still playing Skylanders?
Ding.
:O
ohshi
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
KA-BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!
SuperBrony64: I started playing Minecraft again
sagas: i dont have enough time nor energy to explain to you how terrible the star wars prequels were. Everlasting_Joy you tell him
11,02Litwick: I wish, still haven't gotten the thing fixed :/
BOOM!
WTF-BOOOOOOOOOOM
FIRE BURN
11,02Paladin_Drakkenwolf: Awesome!
SO much for that plan
The pressure wave would have killed them
00,10budget was low, had to figure out a way to kill most the guys in one go.
Awwww what happened SB?
Theres a lot of candle/flashlight glare in this movie
SuperBrony64: I am apparently hated by prince-lemon for thinking the 11th Doctor is the best
Bronysith: No, that's your job.
hehehehehe FIRE
I have never played Minecraft :$
And there goes most of the completely forgetable characters.
Everlasting_Joy: at least hold sagas down so he cant leave
FLAME ON
Sumica: i would figure...also is this the one with the mutated alien?
Ponies47: Minecraft is fun
13http://fav.me/d53dzfz
11,02sagas: :O
10Engrish
/me just noticed that the mane 6 were no longer in front of the screen
Haha the alot
00,10it was born from cow
I'm still angry that I paid good money to see this thing.
OK who let Bomberman into this Prison?
Shizuka: What is that?
dat alot
what we watching today?
Bronysith, what do you think of Star Tours 2 at the Disney parks then?
Ponies47 you need to try to play mincraft its fun
Shizuka: lol
Shizuka: It looks like sky bison fluttershy
13Meanwhile: it's alot of fluttershy
Nittany_Discord: After the movie, could someone stream the Alien campaign of the recent AvP game?
SuperBrony64: There really isn't anything new worth discussing on my end.
Jim: Meh. Not now
sagas: in the OT the force was a spirtitual thing and came from nature and stuff. in the prequels it was biological bullshit
Stop drop and roll!
Shizuka: I guess it is.
11,01Dunno who has it.
11,01I don't have it.
MY FLESH! IT BURNS!
13actually after movie i was hoping to do some doom 3 for you
13though i'm almost caught up to where nittany left off
SuperBrony64: :O because I think the 11th doctor is best or :O that prince-lemon hates him?
How did get burnt?!
/me is now playing yakety sax in another tab
Shizuka: Ok
Shizuka yay for more doom 3
Shizuka.....but...but...oh wait yeah do that..kirz isnt here ye
t
Sagas is trolling hard
Shizuka: Sadly wont be here for that :(
sagas: in the prequels the lightsaber battles were all choreographed bullshit and felt more like dancing instead of actual sword fighting. there was no tension. luke vs vader was so good because you could tell luke was a novice fighter
Alien!
That 1992 CGI...
Open the pod bay doors.
ALIENS! :o
That's how I imagine "Meet the Pyro"
Come at me bro
Can we stream someone playing the Alien vs Predator game as the Alien?
bait
11,01Shizuka: You're fast. You're also cheating though.
Come and get me fucker!
DED
That guy had balls of steel.
ded
Fatality
Well that plan failed horribly
13only mostly~
00,10door must be realy thin
Open the pod bay doors..................................
sagas: and in attack of the clones. Jango fett was hired to kill the senator. He pays anotehr assasin to assassinate the senator. The assassin could disguise herself as any species ever and disguised her face with a scarf as well
That took awhile for him to die.
11,01Now he figured out how to make them work.
Plan Failure Failed
Arteza147: Im afraid I cant do that
thier gonna drown
^
dat religious music
nothing works, but fire fighting system does?
13if they did more damage at once to get me below 60.. i'd probably still be powering through since i know where everything is..
To be continued...
8:25/7:25c nao.
suddenly: Sauna
The sheer dullness and pretentiousness of this movie is astounding.
oh gog now even IE have a pony icon
"Man that was one helluva party"
Everybody dead!
And of coruse somehow this whol mess will continue
ahahahaha
Why?
DocSane: ikr
how much is left of the movie
can i see?
Because lazy writers
DocSane: The fiirst two are MUCH better
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/13983?search=alien
sagas: then when anakin and obi wan were chasing the assasin. they somehow spotted one speeder among millions on a giant planet.
Shizuka i'm up for watching more doom 3 ;)
MACHINES!!!!
11,01Steam has me at 27 hours with the game. Maybe 3/4 of that playing.
The only David Fincher film I really like is Fight Club.
k thanks
The dead...are not dead.
and that was realized by IE themselves?
Ok then.
Ummm....yes thay are
Bronysith: Like I said. Not as good as the original trilogy and didnt live up to the hype, but still entertaining on their own. Except maybe the first. Not crazy about that one
Everlasting_Joy: oh god i need to take a breath
Lamp hey
"And they ate the minstrels. And there were much rejoicing."
nah, fan made just like chrome one
ahh
sagas: no. the entire prequels made no sense at all
What's up bro?
Bronysith: :D, there's a lot of rage with those movies.
I Love David Fincher
11,01Smartguns are smart.
Lambo I love him more,
She has a *shot*
i remeber seeing a pic with an IE pony saying "I'm sorry im so usless.....i'll just go away now"
Bronysith: I found them to be actiony films and I enjoyed them as such
Everlasting_Joy: damn by the time im done explaining this shit. im gonna need to regenerate myself into the 43rd bronysith
nothin much whatchin alien 3:)
"Let's ROCK!" *** braaaap! braaap! braaaap! ***
sagas: they are just bullshit
dat shaving
Oh. So am I!
I missed too much of the movie :) Well, Imma download it later
Bronysith: :).
Poor guy
^
while she's crying
Everlasting_Joy: which incarnation are you on right now? of yourself
Bronysith, I ask again since you were busy talking with sagas, what do you think of the updated Star Tours at the Disney parks then?
he he glad u could make it
How many are left alive?
Spike....... Dragon....... It all makes sense..........
inb4 it gets in there
So much saying of the word (squee) :O
JESmith71: dont know. havent been to disney world for over a decade3
Yeah. I'm bald now!

what u serious
He plays for the other team
Sex.....
Bad idea
daw i'm sad for the pony not for IE
Yeah!
He will free it?
why
yeah
Bronysith: I feel you are biased as you were expecting a fantastical reboot of the original trilogy. You had a higher standard
IDK?
BAD IDEA!
DED
Great. You let the lunatic loose.
"The crazy guy told of their return. But no one wanted to believe"
11,01Betrayal.
BAD FREAKING IDEA
bonked
This is stupid writing
wat.
BONK!
Bonk!
i need to see you
Idiot.
Hey guys, I killed everyone! :D
:P
Bronysith: 5th.
This movie is SOOO much worse than Prometheus.
Wait, what? Why did he attack him?
sagas: no. i was 5 when the prequels came out. i loved the original trilogy when i was 8 and then the prequels. the prequels dont even feel like star wars
Ah, Imma just read the wikipedia entry
man im loving teamfortress two
Yeah. Hangout Saturday?
Everlasting_Joy: all righty
of course we need one dirtbag in a Alien movie

Meanwhile: corrupt corporation
Hi Canadian_Brony
Hello Canadian_Brony
sagas: the original trilogy is pure creativity, they shot on location and used animotronics. the stupid prequels are just shot on computer
thx
Hey Canadian_Brony :)
He sounds like Zecora
^
i would guess
Dang it1 Digglet isn't on here! D=
DED

Hello cachi01
cachi01, some time this week, I would like a match against you...
Hey cachi01 :)
Shamroc: He should stop startin' the slag.
Thanks, crazy guy. Problem was almost solved.
I am the moistest of aliens
sagas: anytime theres any character development, its 2 sometimes 3 characters either walking down a hall, one stops and turns around to say something. Then the other is when they are sitting on a couch. that is it
Order? Die
And then it ate him.
sagas: in the prequels
cachi01: :)
Unsurprisingly.
Meanwhile: ikr the slag best stop starting...oh look he dead....should of stop starting
DED
Was this in the original? I don't remember any of this
ded
Obsidian seems legit
00,10next you can die
WallDives: sure maybe tomorrow!
ded
INB4 the ending:S
11,01Why does this guy want to be killed?
Bronysith: New technology. Animatronics were the best at the time.
Bwa-hahahaa
Dead
dat cgi
Shamroc: Slag should stopped startin'
cachi01, cool.
dat bad CGI
Motherfucker deserves to die.
Wow, that looked horrible.
I shall call her - Queen Crysalis
Nothing ages as poorly as bad early CGI.
Cypresswolf: :D
Bronysith: Now its cgi
sagas: animatronics are more impressive than any bullshit CGI cause it requires creativity. now you just pay a guy a shitzillion dollars to make it
so what?
PONY SWAG!
Lamp u doin that stayin up thing taht toomey set up
Wayland corp needs to start stopping. Those slags
afk
Bronysith: truth
same thing?
Meanwhile: tell them to stop starting
I don't like the alien franchise in general (although I do like Alien and Aliens)
Midnight_Fyre: TY MY BRONY /)
err... same thing black dude
Teenie weenie
Bronysith: The cgi is still made by artists. It allows them more freedom than the animatronics
teehe
my dick................
same here :)
hey all
It is just stupid. "Oh, and HERE is another dumb reason why we have another Alien movie."
Shamroc: you tell them to stop startin'
IM SO SORRY!!!!!!!!
Hye ponibas :)
Meanwhile: stop starting ye slag..
*het
Teeny Weeny?
Bronysith: (\
*hey
Teenie weenie string bikini

hi ponibas
Lambo: alien and aliens are the only good alien movies lol
Shamroc: yer mums a slag.
hi ponibas!
I love you Ponibas!
ponibas: Sorry I derped :P
sagas: noooo. its all bullshit excuse for the director to shove as much bullshit as he/she can in the movie as possible, it is incredibly suffocating
:P We've got a itty bitty little little twinkie pinkie problem
cachi01: The other ones dont exist to me..........
Meanwhile: ye mums a slag....so is ye siblings..if you got any...also STOP STARTING
I wish lamp had derped... oO
This movie needs more Game over Man! Game Over
^
Arteza147: just imagine they are fanfics lol
i love every pony
sagas: just because you can do something doesnt mean its a good idea
In the future, everyone's British. Except for women.
Working as a unit
Tee Hee!
Shamroc: Yer a slag.
Thius movie is giving me a headache
TheGreatAndPowerfulT... Meanwhile's a slag..and so is his mum
Welcome to the human race. Where everyone is out for no1
and he should stop starting
One Welsh guy
SHADDAP! I'm trying to think
I came in late so I've missed most of the movie :P
this headache is giving me a movie
So much talking. Not enough killing
Bronysith: The cgi allows for the directors to have greater freedom and scale. With cgi you arent as limited to what you can do
sagas: I CAN take a syringe and remove the creme from a cadbury egg and inject it with ranch dressing. Still doesnt mean its a good idea
Bronysith: oh god
love u Lamp
that sounds amazing Bronysith
Bronysith: Sounds like a good prank
sagas: again. i have the freedom to blow my brains out. still not a good idea
SirGanjalf: i did it before
Is it wrong that I find an arguement over the Star Wars prequals more entertaining than the actual movie
Bronysith: wooow its not a good idea? i wa splaninng on doing it this weekend
mmmmmmmm Lamp
I haz Filly Rainbow Dash headphones
Canadian_Brony: /)
Bronysith (\
Canadian_Brony: Im jelly :(
what Hat said
/me 11,01cycles
/me now knows what "slag" means and will not use it.
Bronysith: The syringe is like the cgi. You can use it to inject ranch or you can use it to inject something better. All the syringe (cgi
hehehe u making me blush :$
LOL
) does is give you greater freedom
Its a queen.
btw, what I miss?
darn caps lock
...
spoiler
Canadian_Brony: LE GASP! THAT'S AWESOME! :o
to flavor your cadberry eggs how you wish
Uh oh
mmmm lamp
Bronysith: Well they did was last year they updated Star Tiurs and they changed the ride film and it now has several different scenes and which ones you see are random everytime you ride. Like you'll either go to Hoth and fight AT-ATs, go to Tatooine and do a podrace, or go to Kashyyyk and do a speeder bike chase. Then you get a message from either Akbar, Yoda, and Leia (They got Carrie Fisher to do the new lines!). Then you get the fimal scene wher
Aaaaaah fudge.
dat alien
SO MUCH TEXT 6_9
dat wall
:o
dat wall of info
Ponies47 they are Philips Customer Design Headphones
aww shes preganant, The alien father would be proud.......wait when did she.....bah! Never MIND! >_<
It looks like it's really ugly.
...maybe I should have PM'ed him that
I KNEW IT! I CALLED IT! THATS WHY IT DIDNT KILL HER!
eugh
congratulations its a xenomorph!!!!!!
Canadian_Brony: Nice! :)
sagas: But its even more than that........
I can't see it
11,01She's going to have a kid.
Ah bollocks.
Expecting a baby, getting an xenomorph
Arteza147: How so?
sagas: The OT shot on location and took timing and used models for the ships and stuff. it was awesome. the plot was fantastic and had lovable characters. The Prequels soley relied on cg to attempt and fail to impress the massives. no characters or plot whatsoever, it was all rushed so that they could get vader in the suit
00,10no wonder she has been so hormonal
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: care to tell me what it means?
Bad Luck Ripley
Dat Lamp
sagas: Do you mind spoilers much?
time to get an alien abortion
WHen the hay did she had alien sex
Ohh baby.
Or broke it up into several message
mazal tof!
s
OGOD
Arteza147: wait then
Every damned Alien movie since this one ends up as a weird ass abortion metaphor.
/me dies
So much saying of the word (squee) :O
Lock yourself in the vault
Guard will let us know by screaming
No air conditioning. Good thinking.
/me regenerates into the 43rd Bronysith
I call zombie bullshit
Lamp u my baby
sagas: You have chosen....... wisely
Inb4 the alien bursts out dancing the Michigan Rag
I dont think shit
kill the host!!!
^
depends but basicly: "Slut"
no AC? I hope they don't have a hot summer
oh..makes sense
Bronysith: HOW MANY OF THERE ARE YOU!?! :o
FUCKED
I wonder if she got pregnant with the docs kid? hybrid maybe?
Stabby Stabby
Well, you're focked then.
I think the vault can be opened from the outside, so they can't hide in it
if i drinked a cup of vodka every time they say fuck i would have been dead by now
Newt seemed to do pretty well.
it was 108 today... if I didn't have AC.. I'd kill someone
son
Someone should count how many times the word "fuck" is used in this movie
also it was the name of a transformer and an insult used by transformers
Ponies47: well your the 47th incarnation of Ponies right?
^
Game Over, Man! Game Over!
that i get...
Slag is also the term for molten metal.
Howdy y'all.
Bronysith: idk :P
hi Everlasting_Joy
Jim I've got 4 already, and I came in 5 minutes ago
My chat derpped on me.
GET TO THA FURNACE!!!!!!11
Everlasting_Joy: :<
Let's assemble everyone one area without question, then plan where we want to go
Fire solves everything
is also a programming lenguage
5
cachi01: Try this with Scarface. You'll be dead in the first quarter of the movie
Everlasting_Joy: hi man. i was right. i had to regenerate to continue to explain the shit prequels to sagas
6
Jim: I saw this when I was about 8 years old. It was one of my first memories of the word fuck
63524
hat, so does a nuke! ^.^
SirGanjalf: lol
....TO MANY MEANINGS
hi Everlasting_Joy
lets all go to the furnace
Bronysith: :D
Charge! GO GO GO!
I have a switch in my house that is labeled Furnace. I have no idea what it does and its really ominous. =P
We must nuke them from orbit.
00,10they wont kill it.
I'm gonna stop counting in-chat. I'll get kicked for excessive ping
8:40/7:40c nao.
We have the technology.
We can rebuild him
We can rebuild him, we have the technology
Bronysith: I believe you have a rose colored view of the OT and a tinted view of the prequals
7 . . . DAMMIT!
Fuck you.
Freeze her today! They have the technology.
R-Dash5000: eeyup. 7:40 PM here :)
I think this may have been the first R rated film I ever saw that wasn't edited for TV
It won't really kill everything, only these guys don't have weapons
Barbetos: its probably used to turn on a furnace
The code the code! :O
afk
I don't have a furnace to my knowledge =P
Ripley dont give a fuck about your wife and child
The Password is Password
Lambo: They get what they deserve
Daddy! You need to find me a mommy!
10
sagas: well i feel im talking with a guy who soley relies on graphics for a game to tell the story and is in no way impressed by depth of gameplay. you are such a COD and BF3 fan
Give up the CODE :[
Yeah, there's no way a dad is going to overlook his kid for anyone elses sake.
Fuck you and your aliens.
Free Hat!!
Lamp im trying somewhat
/me takes the hat
Where?!!?
Lambo: http://affordablehousinginstitute.org/blogs/us/wp-content/uploads/brilliant_681.jpg
00,10Ripply is selfish
Awh! Who is gonna be my mommy?
Lambo: wow rockstar is a genius
Barbetos: if your house is relatively old it might have had one in the past now though its probably redundent
sagas: there are 2 types of people in this world. People who are intelligent and creative whom love to actually work hard with their hands to make aweosme stuff. then there are people who like the star wars prequels
Bronysith: Those fans are the same as you with rose colored lenses
:O She's carrying Queen Crysalis
I don't think this is how she pictured parenthood.
Dat metaphor
Sumica: well the aliens have pretty much been responsible for the death of everyone she loved.
Lamp idk
Spectrum_Plush yeah its old, so that make sense.
sagas: actually the prequels did have a plot
11
She wants to explore a basement in a basement
00,10the network knows all
>_< Ripley's Doomed us ALL
sagas: to completely destroy star wars
Is she gonna breastfeed me?
At least you know your child will have a future
nah
awaiting aknowledgement
Lamp when i find one you can ask her

so saxy is the oficial bronystate scapegoat ?
10:<
00,10got your tail
Wrek: that is a rhetorical question
Hey Nittany_Discord and cheers Spectrum_Plush.
Ew.
And hey ZappyTheUnicorn.
Grab the tail bowser style
I'm right on time, Obsidian. This is the same time I get on just about every day. I normally can't get on earlier than this :P
Eeyup.
Then again, I'll count.
05R-Dash5000 admitting attempt to troll? tsk tsk thats agaisnt the rules. you are now on the watchlist
Oh sorry
I kinda hopes the Alien gets saved. It is just doing what its instict is telling it to do. It should live and kill everybody
Everlasting_Joy: i love eccleston, so far i loved the world war 3 epi
im kidding
Okay, seriously this thing has killed people in SECONDS yet Ripley is still alive
WHY?!
it can be Skyland Sword
I feel bad for the Alien
R-Dash5000: admitting attempt to troll? fail
05otakon: that was made clear earlier
0,14because she has an Alien Queen egg in her
wwrryyyyyyy?
The alien wants her to live
otakon, she has a baby alien in her
Wrek: I know :P
why
otakon: Did you miss the part where she has a baby queen in her torso?
SaxyPretender: I KNOW and you SPOIL
47
Bronysith: Those two weren't my favorites, but they do estabilsh some very big things.
05its past that point so nope
11,01If she dies, the alien in her dies.
shut it!
Meanwhile: no I didn't, but surprised no one asked the question
she has an egg in her
haha
Nittany_Discord: and yet THE DEAD COW
For the lead!
Hes waiting for dramatic effect
+Zero Gravity
otakon: Because everyone else was watching. :P
Everlasting_Joy: i loved the bit with the elevator. i couldnt breath
MAN.
Ew.
Now she just has to kill herself
dat music
so we KNOW that the embryo's can birth AFTER the host dies goddammit
05Everlasting_Joy: marathon fan? /) [LEGENDARY brohoof]
and everything will be fine
11,01otakon: Good point.
til they decide to reboot the series
again
Nittany_Discord: so maybe...THAT'S why they added in the cow scene
00,10We got a deal, I get to kill you
Wrek: a crater just appeared in my home from that brohoof
Dillon, Y u no let me die?
Wrek: Sorry good sir, (I know I'm going to make you cringe here) no PC games for me.
Wrek I've never played marathon, would you say it is worth my time playing?
it dies first THEN you
I thought it was trapped behind the door?
Oh so it's ok if YOU stay down there?
and suddenly VIDEO LAG
Everlasting_Joy: but marathon is also for xbox
NO DEAL!
sagas: so are they
oh LAWD
That was a pathetic no
Bye, bye, Roc.
Mother of god~
Nooo black guy :(
Dillon NO GODDAMMIT NO!
DED
Mother of god...
NO!
Not the bees!
:I
NOT BADASS BLACKMAN NO!
cachi01: But it's not the original.
48
No black guy ever makes it till the end
black dude why you so Badass
Jim: the bees
pour the damn lead and give hima painless death
NOT THE BEES
let the black guy suffer
And my internet cuts out and disrupts the chat right after I ask something, perfect
12nice SS
COME ON THAT'S ALL YOU GOT?
He died for her sins
Pour the lead!
12zombieing atm
POUR IT ALREADY!
Wow, he's STILL talking shit
Take your time
Not painless, just faster.
He is the fucking man.
You call that breaking my spine?!
FATALITY
11,01Weeeeee!
he's not important enough to die fast
not the black guy man
11,01It's sweage.
05DashWithRainbows: the first one? probably not so much. its way outdated by todays standards and doesnt play aswell as say doom. but the story is godlike. the gameplay gets good in the second one and 3rd. so basically get through the first game. play the second one and 3rd one for the actual game
11,01*Sewage
Meanwhile: agreed, goddamn magnificent bastard
steam.. hoott
ded
DED
You alien team ladies wouldn't know how to break a spine if you took chiropracty lessons.
Pour molten lead on alien. Kicking ass the Medieval way
ded
Well if I know anything about the Alien movies, this didnt kill it and it will thaw out in a later movie
oh yeah he dead
Yaaaay.
It died from lead poisoning
Poor guy.
And the audience cheers, because now they know this damn movie is almost over.
well, it's dead for sure

LOL
Wrek Alright then. I'll have to try and find some way to play them then. I'll take your word on the story and hopefully, I won't be disappointed.
Well, then again, the guy by his own admission was a bad person.

11,01Trololol alien.
OH CMON

I want the Alien to win
Fuck your hot lead.

THE FUCK DID IT SURVIVE MOLTEN LEAD!?
gtg. Bye everypony
Definately HACKS
Does the alien count as a mary sue if it's perfect in every way
00,10badnews that was't lead, it was pudding.
The Alien never did anything wrong
all they did was armor it
bye Canadian_brony
Bye, Crono_brony
See ya later Canadian_brony
Sumica: yum

Canadian_brony: Bye

Diglett: it's just pissed now
Don't mind, me, Crono_brony
Fire killed the first one, now water shall kill this one!
wait, i'm leaving?
Sagas: Well.. It killed marines..
Great soundtrack.
Shatter reaction.
Water! Its one weakness!
Its like punishing a shark for attacking a surfer it thought was a seal
DED
heat + cold = boom
05the exosceleton seems to be able to survive kingswater strong acid. i think it can handle some lead otakon.
DED MOTHER FUCKA!!!!
Eq
05sk*
0,14haha
Ew
da fuq
wat
lol he blew up
Kill it with SCIENCE!
Soo, they splode?
KABLOOIE
Wat
Water + Pudding = EXPLOSION
True fact actually, it has acid blood. Why would lead be a big deal.
I feel sorry for the poor Alien :(
Obsidian: seems legit D:
11,01Now drop and kill yourself.
And they say science doesnt solve all problems
Everlasting_Joy: and the tardis doesnt work. DAFUQ!?
water is dangeours
What is Kingswater?
it blew up becease it became super heated by the lead, then she cooled it causing it to blow
ese science Op
Pb + H2O = BOOM
And now......... BURN THE WITCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111
Wrek: well, this is not a Ph thing, this is a 1200 degrees Fahrenheit MELTING LEAD TEMPERATURE thing. It's got acid blood so OFC it could take acid.
Arent the marines going to kill them for seeing it
Now I must kill myself and never appear in another sequel. Ever. Ever.
lead is hot hot melts thing
I miss the doctor. He died way too soon
Till Alien Resurrection.
The Alien should have survived :'( It didnt deserve to die
The water cooled the lead
Water > Alens, heck Signs even proves that
00,10every movie always seems to end with her geting mostly nude
05Randomnerd: the strongest sulphuric acid mixed with the strugnest salpeter acid
Bronysith: While in reality a plot point, the in-universe explination is the paradox.
05the mixture is acidric enough to break down gold
49
05and is called kingswater (in europe)
Sumica: And progressively more ugnly
Wrek: it has acid FOR BLOOD, ofc acid didn't work on it.
Oh shit
Aqua Regia!
Ohai Bishop.
Bishop?
Whoops. I accidentaly pressed enter.
Bull shit
BISHOP!?
bishop
They want the Alien
Ohi human bishop
nope
no moar bulshit
Weyland
Sorry, wrek, I am lame, I only know it by the latin name.
HOW IS HE ALIVE!?
Carl Bishop Weyland.
I'm the man who's gonna burn your house down. With the lemons.
05otakon: then stop makign pointless statelemnts
This is "Mr Weyland"
49
This is the first time I saw this movie and I can honestly say that it didn't come close to the first two
blood or its alie!!
Yeah...
Suddenly, ALIENS!
otakon: its the real Bishop not the ANdroid
otakon: Burned.
TE
Obsidian: oh
Whoops. I accidentaly pressed enter.
ALIENS.
I hope it hatches and kills them all
bullshit
I don't want to say it's aliens, but...
lies
They want to take her in for Resurrection! Quick kill yourself!
05R-Dash5000: no spam
dat bullshit
Obvious lie is obvious
More bullshit
KILL YOURSELF!!!
He is a liar.
00,10we got every thing we need from the scans, we cant let it live. Some one might be able to compeat with us
bullshit
lies
Wrek: the hell are you talking about? what pointless statement? Molten Lead is on a different destructive level than acid, how is it that thing could take acid make it be able to withstand molten lead?
IF SHE FALLS FOR THIS SHE IS A DUMBASS!
otakon: oh dear
This is probably one good scene in the movie.
00,10Ripply, think of Jonesy
Wait, I'm getting some weird RE4 vibes with that alien in her.
Jump in the molten lead, you moron
sagas: just watch
otakon: Y u keep contradicting yourself.
Dont you dare fall for it
trust is an illusion
KILL YOURSELF NOW!
Look doom guy in back round
(Waiting for dramatic scene)
/me slaps sagas

SUICIDE IS THE ONLY WAY!
any more creepy stares dude?
"lol, this is going on youtube"
Quick, we must keep her alive for the sequal
I used to be an inmate like you...
/me stabs Meanwhile
Meanwhile: how am I contradicting myself? I just said how is that thing being able to withstand acid any indication that it can withstand molten lead
ouch
Bonk.
DED

The poor Alien didnt deserve this
0,14now give a thumbs up
NOPE just Chuck Testa
ded
DED

ded
I rate that dive 2 / 10

T2 was filmed in the next studio.
OH GODDAMMIT STUPID MIPS WORK RIGHT!
05last thought: wait this was a dumb ide...(melt)
00,10and her sacrafise put out the fires of mount doom.

That back-flop must have been painful
Now she is the sun
Sumica: think you mean mordor

Wrek: ikr
Darf14: Come on!! I say 5/10! She at least kept the same figure all the way down! D:
The preeeeccciiiooooouuuuusss
NUKE IT FROM ORBIT!
She destroyed the "One RIng"...finally
Wait, it hatched from her in the first version. Now she just falls in.
05GeeGeePony: molten metal, not molten rock
Dawn of a new day
Fun fact: This whole movie was just a dream while she was asleep in the escape ship from the last movie
This movie did not exist; it was some bad dream that Ripley had
I rate harshly on dives
DocSane: yeah, I remember that too
Okay my interne lagged there, did the alien burst out of her chest? If not then this is the special edition
she had the prescious
lol
its not like its the last xeno in exsistance...is it?
And it was proven that even human skin can survive short contact with molten lead if it's wet
50
And then Ripley woke up in a cryo tube.
dat message from the 1st movie
"Worst dream ever"
dat audio message
brony_swan: The sequals/spin-offs say no
AND THEN RIPLEY HAD A WET DREAM
SirGanjalf: most likely only for a split second, then the water would evaporate
"She's ghosting."
And for some reason, we hear the final log from the Nostromo
AND THATS THE END! THERE IS NO 4th MOVIE!!!!!
RIP Ripley
D:
End of line
End Of Line!
"Hey! Who turned out the lights?"
05RIPley
...
Woop

apparently i missed a lot of stuff, but then again, i never was big on the alien movies
Arteza147: or third. the last 2.5 hours never happened

It's 9:20/8:20c now.

Nerom: THere was a cow chestbuster
6/10
Ingwaz: Yep but MAYBE it could buy Alien some time. (still think it was rather a hollywood magic though)
Part one was better then this
i think the secod was best
6/10 I'm going to head over to the bronyfunds stream for a little bit. Bye everypony.

otakon: Anamanaguhi kicks ass.
So i heard that i like scott pilgrim music as well... oh wait... this isn't how it works!
Much of the anti-Brony backlash comes from people who are disturbed by the idea on non-gay guys liking something "girly".

Sumica: I see what you mean
cachi01: /)
Bronysith: (\

Rarity is actually dead and her spirit was merged with a changling princess
I'm not a brony.
I only watched 2 episodes
:O
Obsidian i knew of MLP FIM around say near those episodes of 10 and up
I like the show, but I am not a brony.
BuckWheat: FOR FUN!
It isn
BuckWheat: you are a brony
BuckWheat: u like the show = u r a brony =D

No, I'm not a BRONY
WELCOME TO THE HERD BuckWheat
BuckWheat: and how old are ya?

yep u are =D
No I'm not a brony. I enjoy the show with moderation.
ok your not a brony, we can accept that :_
Because whoever posted it deserves a Brohoof.
BuckWheat: If you arent part of the target demographic yet still watch the show and enjoy it, you are a brony
Wreck It Ralph looks awesome
BuckWheat: If you are here. You are a Brony
I am 17 years OLD
I am here because my friend sent me here.
O.o
BuckWheat: This site is called BRONYstate. Therefore, if you're not using the default alias and actually chatting then you're a brony
BuckWheat: 17 years old and enjoy FIM = brDony =
brony*
=D
He told me it was a cool site so I was bored and checked it out
BuckWheat: it's really just a name for a fan of the show. You don't have to be a fanatic fan, but your a fan of it nontheless. Still, welcome and enjoy while your here.
BuckWheat: Do not be afraid of being a brony. It is lot of fun :)
err.... you better not push it
cachi01 tbh you are a brony if you only want to see yourself as one you aren't one because you watch the show :D
BRONY!
flutter_spin: /)
otakon: I don't know....people will tease me. And I don't want to be teased. And so I shall not indulge into that.
BuckWheat: Its nothing to be afraid of
okay guys, enough of the brony talk leave him be to absorb this fairly odd place.

otakon as i said to cachi01 its up to the person if they want to see themselfs as one or not

oh and Decibelle from the Smile Project is AWESOME: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bf6__NZ3Hgg best work

Hey RAWRity :$
BuckWheat: whats funny?
0,14oh hai RAWRity
The world leaders thing.
hiya RAWRity we gotta a newbie, say hi to BuckWheat
oh hai RAWRity
hi RAWRity!
We were the ones who orchastrated the assassination of bin laden
/me glomps RAWRity
Heya RAWRity. How's it going?
Bronysith: that's teh Stone Cutters, not bronies
RAWRity: we have a brony whom is in denile
WTF @SuperBrony64? I didn't say anything about Pokemon
this is awesome shizuka
lol
otakon: now now, we don't call them newbies anymore. We call them blank flanks.
otakon: FOOL the stone cutters are bronies
Shizuka: nice mix =D
Alright everybody, if I could have your heads for one last time.
I'm not in denile. I just like to enjoy the show with moderation!
No, the Stone Cutters created 3.5
Litwick: yes?
Bronysith: leave him be, if he doesn't want the label "Brony" we won't force it on him.
RAWRity: Implication is that every brony has a cutie mark. What's yours?
this music doeesn't go with the manga i am reading! =p
otakon: fine
lol. I enjoy the show, alone.
Litwick: yes?
Litwick I'd give you mine, but I kinda like it
Alright everybody *slaps ruler down on the table* HUSH!
11,02Eddmario: Check your previous messages for the joke :)
ponibas: lol wut r u reading?
BuckWheat: We all started that way
Litwick: harrumph
woah
hay sb64
0,14yes, Litwick?
BuckWheat look at me i have seen the show since about episode 10 and up and been here for almost a year i think still don't see myself as a brony :P
A friend of mine is going through some (and by some I mean A LOYAL SHIT TON) of trouble.
11,02Hai TheSpitFirecolt :)
the hell updates, STOP MEDDLING WITH MY MONITOR
BuckWheat: If you embrace it wholly, it feels great
13couple minutes more~
@SuperBrony64 and how would I do that?
*EXPLODES*
BuckWheat: you are in a chat full of bronies. You are on a site called "Bronystate". Your username IS A PONY PUN. It's time to come out of the stable.
Litwick: what's wrong?
Litwick: damn what happened?
killerpony7733: You in denile too?
Especially watching the show in the Trollestia streams on youtube. Those are awesome
mixes are good :)
and yes, we are calling it "coming out of the stable" now.
/me 00,02hugs Shizuka
well im off everypony CYA :)
Huh? This name I chose a name off the top of my head.
She needs some help. As in money help. Shje's doing a commission stream and will only ask for $5 for each "chibi pony" she draws.
RAWRity: works for me
sagas nope i know my mind i choose not to see myself as a brony
bye Darf14 take care
Didn't know it was a Pony referenc e
Darf14: Dream of ponies
RAWRity: I thought that was clopping?
Arpeture SCience!!
sagas you aren't a brony if you don't want to me
If pagans can call it "coming out of the broom closet" we can make our own version.
/me swoons for Shizuka's music
sagas be*
Litwick: dude, if I could I would but I'm broke. I can't help I can only wish them luck.
http://www.livestream.com/sheepyichigo Just help her. I beg you with every piece of my heart to help her. EVERY FIBER OF MY FUCING BEING. HELP THIS POOR PERSON.
Coming out of the stable. Okay then.
DAT BRODYQUEST!
Reikim: lol never heard of that before
13nope
Why do I have a useless button called "PonyChat"?
13this is
Hey everypony, I'm back!
Shizuka: aint this part of brodyquest?
13Mannheim Steamroller - Going to Another Place
13crossed with
killerpony7733: Whats the difference? What stops you from calling yourself a brony? What attribute do you feel you lack for the title?
13Portal 2 - Robots FTS
13er FTW
lol
Oh god we're discussing the philosophy of being a brony.
I think asking the question 'are you a brony' means you are one
BTW, been watching season 2 of "Community". THE PAINTBALL EPISODE WAS AMAZING.
FTS = For the suck?
oooh now i can recognize it thx Shizuka :)
10/9c/7p now.
But let me see if I can pull that brony pic again
0,14all right folks, if you can spare a couple of bucks to help someone out, head here please: http://www.livestream.com/sheepyichigo
If only season 4 of Community wasn't guaranteed to suck.
You know your a brony when you don't go a day without checking EQD?
sagas i don't see myself as want and don't want to be one i am on the borderline of being one but i choose not to identify myself as one besides MLP FIM isn't in my mind 24/7
hey i got a question; for renting an apartment, is a $1200 move in fee (includes deposit, pet fee, parking, administration) and $665/mo a good deal?
Barbetos: i just log onto bronystate
sagas as one*
RAWRity: So I hear u liek mudkipz
RoboGerbil: depends on how bit the apartment is, and if utilities are covered.
13remember, if rent is more than a third of your income, you can't afford it
*big
Barbetos: i just love ponies and the whole brony community
All right, I gotta bounce. Later, all you crazy kids.
Bye DocSane
killerpony7733: You dont have to have it on your mind 4/7 to be a brony.What are you afraid of to stop you from calling yourself a brony? What makes you not want the title?
mlp fim is in my mind the 24/7 with rock, metal, chiptune and videogames in its side
*24/7
What's EQD?
BuckWheat: equestria daily
....oh this should be fun
Oh.
Shizuka gives us all a life lesson.
BuckWheat: Euestriadaily.com
BuckWheat: soon your home trolololo
:V
*checks site out*
sagas: Not all of us like to wall ourselves off with the term.
*Equestriadaily.com
my rent wasn't such a high percentage until I got bitchslapped with a child support payment thats near 1200/mo =p
RAWRity: i herd u liek mudkipz
sorry
13guess it still doesn't want to cap the window directly
dat doom
13dunno what i changed yesterday to make it..
Shizuka: nope
Toonami?\
Equestria Daily. Internet Crack for Bronies.
RAWRity: its 1142 sq ft, incluides trash, internet, tv, gas
sagas i don't want to see myself as one and i lack a ambition to wanting to see myself as one, as i said if someone doesn't want to be a brony or see themselfs as one its their choice
DocSane: I know but its just a descriptive term. YOu dont have to live up to any standard exept enjoying the show
sagas: I'm someone who likes the show and the fandom a lot, but being a "Brony" for me is like being a "Trekkie". It implies an unhealthy level of fandom to me.
RoboGerbil: what about water?
AWWWW YEAH
RAWRity: u liek mudkipz?
Alright, thank you Saxy for helping.
killerpony7733: a brony is a teen that watches and enjoys MLP
i gotta pay water, electric and something else...
Oh, so it's a pony information site.
13when we last joined our heroine, she had stopped a distress signal from going out and made her CO really mad
0,14no problem, Litwick, hope everything woks out
0,14*works
Even though we haven't had a viewer jump yet, it's still very thoughtful of you.
lol, for shame Shizuka
Cachi01: (Or a adult)
cachi01: And not being a teen, that especially doesn't describe me.
cachi01: Um... not just a teen. I'm absolute proof of that.
/me gives Shizuka a valyriaan steel katana
Red_Pegasus: yeah or an adult
killerpony7733: I understand that you dont want to identify as one, but Im wondering what underlying reasons are causing you to feel that way.
13aaaand cue bridge collapse!
I always equated a brony to ": A older fan of the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic series and it's associated fan works of stories/music/art.
i like ponies
Kencolt: how old are?
Shizuka: WOOO]
RAWRity: soooo I heer u liek mudkipz
Kencolt: I'm fairly certain I'm the oldest regular here.
EQUIP THE BFG!

00,02wait
Shizuka is a space marine now?
hey everypony
00,02the doom 3 source code was released right?
ponibas: Really?
I can't believe how much this game looks like the original...
Bronysith: do NOT link that here!
the hell is this shit
00,02IT WAS
00,02:)
Kencolt: wow happy soon to come bday lol
yesphase4
Yes Phase4 its been out.
dinky: it's Doom 3
otakon: wait that wasnt the fukkireta dance?
doc, you're what, 40s?
http://derpy.me/56pBS
otakon: FUCKING HELL wrong link
Hi BF
So doom 3 is free to play?
ponibas: 42
lol Bronysith
Bronysith: soooo I heer u liek Princess_Molestia
00,02https://github.com/TTimo/doom3.gpl.git
Bronysith: no, it was not be MORE careful dammit
inc Reverant
he;s 54, i'm 37
DogDog: i love her
That awkward moment
Only thing wrong with this game is no Dwayne Johnson. :V
Yeah. Otakon calls me "The Elder" sometimes. ^_^
So awkward
So, since Brony is a portmanteau of Bro and Pony. Does that make me a Sisony?
sagas Hard to tell i kinda just don't want to see myself as one i simply don't somewhere in my head it says that aloud
Beat the boomer
Bronysith: well... i have some news.
BuckWheat: Nope, still a brony. We don't discriminate.
13Phase4: remind me after this
13there's a review of d3 source code
13blew my mind
Oh,
DogDog: shes right behind me!?
BuckWheat: well, some of the female fans came to call themselves Pegasisters
Do you stream new korra episodes live when they air?
ponibas: That makes me feel less like a creeper for hanging around here.
oh crap REVENANT!
Ah.
BuckWheat: I've heard Pegasister thrown around.
lmao
BuckWheat: No, you're a Brony also-- unless you prefer a feminine title, in which Pegasister is the most common.
So sleepy, Im gonna head to bed... Good night everypony!! Behave yourselves!:)
R-Dash5000: sadly no, but Sumica usually streams them the day after
Pegisister is sometimes called that, But brony is a unisex term
Bronysith: No, no. She's ded.
0,14later RaveBrony
DogDog: no shes not
Ah.
Hello Everypony !
http://derpy.me/5wrae
Bye RaveBrony!:3
just beat Lollipop Chainsaw a little short but still REALLY cool now i need to get the other costumes like Shiro from Deadman Wonderland and outfits based off Highschool of the Dead and other crazy stuff :D BEST GAME EVER!
hi Alister
BuckWheat: honestly at this point Brony is gender neutral
DogDog: shes in my room right now
0,14oh hai Alister
bye RaveBrony
killerpony7733: or you are hiding something
gnight RaveBrony! sleep well:)
hiya Alister
and LAG again
Alister: howd it go?
night RaveBrony sleep well
sagas i techinally do what alot of bronies do and what not but the title doesn't tell me anything it has no meaning to me
I wish this sort of fandom had existed when I was in high school.
yeah, some girls like "pegasister" but really, brony is sort of 'like ponies'
Hey Alister.
Head over to BronyTV this saturday at 11 am EST for a livestreamed episode of Korra. No offense Bronystate.
SaxyPretender: porobbly the first mod who ever said hello to me. /)
otakon: So I hear u liek shipping
well ill brb
SaxyPretender: fail spelling
DogDog: enope
Alister: Didja get that matter sorted out with your friend?
DogDog: but there is a song about it
http://derpy.me/38LD3
0,14(\ Alister
R-Dash5000: we also watch korra and avatar here
Bronysith: I told you i wnated to wait after my finals
http://derpy.me/kVLJD
....so much awesome that avatar
But not live.
Alister: right
I want someone to turn down the temperature a bit. Grr.
BuckWheat: The way I have it figured is, any male who wants to call himself a Brony is a Brony. And any female who wants to call herself a Brony is a Brony. And any female who wants to call herself a Pesister is a Pegasister. And any male who wants to call himself a pegasister is... suspect, buw okay...
DogDog: look up "Otakon is shipped with everything" on youtube... though you MIGHT need a link.
0,14also, R-Dash5000, no advertising other streams without permission
R-Dash5000: korra sometimes its live
CCCP hoof painting! :D
Ah,
Oh.
Reikim: Yeah, Turned out he liked another girl with the same name. It was my mistake on this one
lol Kencolt
dat HAHAHAHAHHA
killerpony7733: yup :3
hi flutter_spin *nomz*
I mean, was asking like if I WAS a brony. Hypothetically.
hey CCCP. Just checking in during my fanfic rewrite break
Alister: Facehoof first, then laugh and thank Celestia that it didn't turn out worse.
Reikim: Anyway , have you completed your first game of Human Revolution ?
BuckWheat: If you want to be.
lol, Saxy and Wrek watchin him
dat shotgun.
Why no you save shotgun ammo?
0,14say wha
flutter_spin: oh cool, can u link it when its done? :)
BuckWheat: You call call youself one but you dont have to, but its nothing to be ashamed of here
Alister: No, not yet. I just finished the fight at Eliza. I couldn't beat it until the boss glitched up and stood there doing nothing while I shot her to death.
I do Like the show, but the term Brony just makes me feel kinda uncomfortable right now. I don't know. I have to wait and see.
love dat plasma rifle the way it fires sounds orgasmic <3
I heer u liek mudkipz RAWRity
http://derpy.me/suywx
As the present stream shows, we're not ENTIRELY about pastel colored equines in a magical kingdom that occiasionally has huge amounts of nightmare fuel injected, only mostly.
lol. I usually post each chapter when I finish, but yeah. It is rough around grammar, but the additional narrative makes it better
Kencolt: Except on new episode days.
Have you gotten the BFG yet?
Reikim: Yeah, true that...
flutter_spin: Um. Did you just say you skip the editing phase?
CCCP steampunk augmented rainbow dash :O
Reikim: yeah , that fight was a pain in the ass if you took sneaking augs. Square Enix outsourced the boss fights to another developer than Eidos and it really shows
Kencolt: But those pony girls are never too far from our thoughts.
killerpony7733: l:D
http://derpy.me/ES6ZA
0,14iirc, that big guy with the wheelchair is called a Pinkie right?
DocSane: Also true, albeit for many reasons.
Alister: I noticed. Barret was a pain in the ass until I looked up a guide.
Reikim: ...sort of. I am re-editing if that counts.
SaxyPretender: correct
CCCP excited spike?
i like Pinkie Pie
killerpony7733: i guess
I like Cherry Pi... oh! oh yeah.
;)
Alright, I'm loging off to try and calm myself down after what's happened.
Kencolt: I really need to host a panel about why people are drawn tot he show.
/me is ridiculously bored...
flutter_spin: Re-editing?
0,14later Litwick, best of luck again
Litwick take care then :)
http://derpy.me/kVLJD http://derpy.me/kVLJD http://derpy.me/kVLJD http://derpy.me/kVLJD http://derpy.me/kVLJD
Punching don't work that well xD
Litwick: its okay
Litwick: what happened?
00,02why dont you shoot the fat guys?
Phase4: boomers
In otherwords, I changed my story ever so slightly. Whatever phases I went through is still there. I just added more context
00,02ah
Reikim: Let me give you a tip for the final boss , in advance. Save a laser gun for it and take the invisibility aug. Then you can shoot trough the window while being invisible from across the room. it's way easier that way
Oh, looks like I missed something.
Kencolt: I have a number of theories, from empathy for the characters to many fans wanting them to be their imaginary girlfriends.
Bronysith: I'll let someone else say what happend. I'm too distressed right now to say.
Litwick: okay. i am with you, share your pain with me
Phase4: if i have learn something about shooting fat guys in horror shooters is that they always explode or leave something nasty on its way
That "night-vision" really sucks...
cachi01 doom 3 fat zombies don't explode or anything
DocSane: That's ridiculous.
Well I gotta shut down. Night everypony!
Eddmario: can you stop spamming those...
Shizuka careful
Alister: Is it?
http://derpy.me/ZkcvG
DocSane: IN my case-- it's just a fun show, an interesting universe, and well... I wish to HECK I'd had the study habits of Twilight Sparkle when I was younger. I'd be a freaking millionaire.
13cause they're more fun to punch~
flutter_spin: Well, whatever that is, I have to tell you now to never, EVER post anything un-edited. And try to get a prereader. Or someday I will fail to resist the urge to strangle you through chat.
DocSane: To me and a good bunch of people here ,yes
Shizuka: What, do their bellies jiggle if you punch them?
CCCP dat daring do ;)
:3
f
At the least it saves on ammo.
Shizuka: punch ALL the demons/zombies?
demons
RAWRity: u liek mudkipz?
Alister: I think the main appeal of the show is that the characters are relatable to people who are in their late teens and early 20's.
WindWhistler: no, they go "Hoo hoo" like the Pillsbury Doughboy
http://derpy.me/dEyhv
otakon: LOL
lol. Trust me, its a lot better than the 1 day wall of text posts.
argh mips STOP LAGGING
13i love this video
/me ships otakon
Shizuka: what video?
DocSane: just a question for me personally. 16 is considered early or late teen ?
DogDog: I should warn you shipping me excessively is a bannable offense.
CCCP: the maintenaincree security video
oh :P
and mips lag again
So many signs
But its already posted and people already read it. Whatever I add sort of doesn't matter at this point.
Alister: That's edging into late, but it's technically mid-teens
It's just one big lie
otakon: O RLY?
:D
13it's a great lampshade on the world design
0,14dat green goo
Vent? Steam?
Gasp!
Alister: But many of the stories involve dealing with alienation and finding your place in the world.
13since there's steam vents EVERYWHERE
13and green goo because... goo sounds funny
lol
Green goo is best goo! =D
DogDog: yes really, please believe me since you'll get an hour ban if you do it excessively
13and if you touch the goo you quarantine for a week
Shizuka: nice, VERY nice
confinement?
Do you guys know when Season 3 starts?
Sounds fair.
BuckWheat: this fall from reports
http://derpy.me/-AGd-
BuckWheat august september
Awesome.
BuckWheat..hasnt been annoucned yet..well the specfic date
DocSane: Well , the cutie mark is kinda a metaphor for self-identity discovery . so yes maybe
flutter_spin: I see a lot of unedited docs, and it shows. I might be a grammar nut, but anything that goes out unedited makes me want to headdesk. I don't care how good your grammar might be; I have near-flawless gramamr on first copies, but I STILL preread because it's always a good practice to do so at least twice.
Alister: The characters are all "adults" with responsibilities, but see themselves as emotionally immature, which is often how young adults see themselves.
Russian guy <3
0,14dat Russian guys
You know what? MLP needs a Paintball episode.
CCCP You are my favorite pony. I dunno why I feel that way, but I do. <3
dat accent
what do we know about S3?
SaxyPretender beat ya to it :D
otakon: so... u liek ships? whats your favorite kind? pirate ships?
PING?
0,14he should say "Nuclear wessel"
DAMN chat derp
that's about it.
RAWRity: It would be a banned episode I bet. Paintball games can be pretty violent. And dramatic.a
who pinged me? >_>
DogDog: space ships, preferrably with massive main cannons and heavy armor.
RAWRity: That's enough for me! :V
Alister: So you character archetypes, like Twilight the constantly-stressed student, always worried about living up to expectations.
hi guys im back
hai RAWRity
damn he is still playing doom 3 i checked 2 days ago and he was still palying this...
hi Diglett
space pirates are best pirates
/me is back with a kit-kat bar "anybody want some?" :)
'Pie'rates are best
Specifically, Metroid space pirates are best pirates.
0,14^
samus aran is best bount hunters
Red_Pegasus: Especially explosive Pierates.
Reikim: would simon count as a space pirate? cause they did an epic battle in space
Alister: Or Rarity, who's constantly at war with her selfish tendencies for promoting herself and her business while wanting to do things to help her friends.
In other words, I finally beat Other M the other day. Post-credits content is the best part of the game.
Quick investigate the clicky noise!
Barbetos spiders? :O
DocSane: Now that I can't quite agree with. They don't see themselves as immature-- I doubt Pinkie Pie would even understand the concept-- but they are young adults, and so have tolearn that they have maturation to go. Just like anyone else.
DocSane: Ok , I know the characters
otakon: so if i put you in a space ship and send it to the moon, then its against the rules?
Barbetos: its a pipe bomb
Yay spiders! :D
/me feels like he came back to a very in-depth discussion and is lost
0,14Reikim, I ask that you not spoil. I plan on some day eventually playing Other M, and until then I stay away from all story info. >.<
Kencolt: They often feel out of their depth, though.
I got the impression the mane six were in their early 20's...
Bronysith Harry Potter Puppet Pals reference? =P
sagas huh still waiting on ya reply
sagas: you startin' ?
DocSane: And who doesn't?
Rarity has her own business after all
Barbetos: indeed /)
\(
sagas: your mum's a slag
(\
Alister: I think I might be
SaxyPretender: No problems. Just telling you that 1) The story is polarizing, and 2) it's a good idea to sit through the credits.
Kencolt: What I'm saying is these characters are very relatable for people who are on the threshhold of adulthood.
0,14will do
13btw
sagas you remember i said before you went brb?
13i've caught up with nittany
Shizuka: good job /)
13this is where he was last i saw him stream d3
So wut now?
killerpony7733: Sorry I dont
Kencolt: The past pony series always portrayed them as children.
I think I most relate to Twilight Sparkle.
Smart to ignore.
DocSane: I know , but I don't think I can personally relate to any of them
I didn't have a lot of friends growing up.
BuckWheat: I relate to Derpy.
I just stayed inside and read all day.
Alister: Really? I find that unusual.
Red_Pegasus: Oh yeah?
Alister: Do you have a favorite character?
13because now i get a rocket launcher
Shizuka: bfg?
DocSane: I think they are relatable to ANYONE-- but I get your point. What I'm saying is, we're watching them from outside-- and so, the characters don't see these flaws AS flaws until they are forced to learn about them as such--which is what people really relate to.
My dilemma is that what passionates me is Politics and History. But I chose to go in Sciences wich I don't like as much. I need the money
killerpony7733: What did you say?
BuckWheat: My favorite food are muffins.
A rocket launcher that shoots RAINBOWS!!
sagas i techinally do what alot of bronies do and what not but the title doesn't tell me anything it has no meaning to me
/me slaps Alister
Shizuka: Let the rocket jumping BEGIN!
DocSane: Well my favorite character is Twilight
Red_Pegasus: Nice x)
sagas thats what i said
Bronysith: what's the ibg idea ?
13one sec
Alister: Very common. Why is she your favorite?
Alister: a job you hate is a job not worth doing at all
also mancubus soon <3'

Red_Pegasus: I prefer cupcakes.
lol
Shizuka looool!
Alister: go for your passion.
DocSane: Where, we on the outside can instantly see "Oh, Snap, thyat was a MISTAKE, Rainbow!" and thus relate, see?
13anyway this is where nittany was last time
Shizuka that was the sound of the clicking!
well night night everypony!!!! <3
DocSane: hold one I have to argue with Bronysith
CCCP goodnight

Alister: Gotcha
I'll be back later. BYE FOR NOW EVERYPONY! :)
night CCCP!
/me hugs CCCP goodnight
STEMM is all that is hiring.
killerpony7733: oh I remember that. I feel there is something about being called a brony that brings along conotations that you dont want. Is that true?
Night CCCP. /)
Night CCCP :)

Bronysith: Passion and Dreams are great. But they can't help you raise a family
Reikim: Electrician is not the same as electrical engineering
doc And of course, most people don't realise that the furry community operates on many different levels.
Randomnerd: i hope your kids don't know that their dad likes a show for little girlls
sagas its really just that i can't find a meaning in calling myself one i do everythine a brony do techinally but the title just can't really give me meaning
Furries are people. MLP has taught me to be less judgemental.
DocSane: I assume that's what he's aiming at.
Kencolt i'm a furry :D
DogDog:Can't tell if anti-brony...
Kencolt been one since 2009
Alister: yes. but in the end, if you hate what you do. you might just kill yourself
Reikim: Hydroelectrical engineer to be more precise. Those engineers in the north of Quebec make a crap ton more money than the south
killerpony7733: argh that was info that you didn't need to share man. Nothing wrong with it really, but you didn't need to share it.
sagas: I think the difference is that furries are attracted to animal characters by their non-humanness. Bronies like the characters in spite of it.
I used to be a furry cartoonist before I had a bout with BGS and kinda lost my fine control for drawing.
Bronysith: I like Engineering. Just not as much as politics and history
otakon if you think so :D
Alister: Oh so true. Give it a couple years and they'll be supplying all of NA with hydro.
Kencolt: Sorry to hear that.
DogDog: I don't have kids. The mistake I made was picking a job that I LIKED, which will never pay well enough.
DogDog: The show is definitely not aimed at little girls haha. They've got a lot of references to some old/ mature stuff.
!ping
!pong
Alister: as long as you dont despise it then okay
argh, STUPID MIPS STOP LAGGING
killerpony7733: You dont find it at all endearing? It doesnt give you a sense of being a part of a community?
sagas: I know an old school furry who hates MLP.
i liek mips cause its good to me
OH HI ARROGANT BASTARD
"Do what you love, and the money will follow" is stupid advice.
Back in the heyday of Small Press Comics, when ANYONE could make an 8 page zine, I won two awards for my most noted title-- a little thing called Star Teddies.
DocSane: Kitty076?
You have to learn to love.
don't you just love those arrogant bastards in video games?
You have to learn to love your job, and learn to love who you're with.
Red_Pegasus: No. Someone I've known IRL for years and years.
Bronysith: Also it kinda gives me an excuse to take engineering like my friend and my DEAR friend
00,02Shizutank
DocSane: I feel that furries like any anthropromorphic animal. Bronies just like specifically this show
Alister: okay then
sagas i interact with the community and act like so many others but the calling myself a brony is to me meaningless since it's just a fancy word for saying fan of MLP FIM
names are just names.
Alister: Dat DEAR.
Alister, taking engineering because your friends are taking it it's a bad idea
isnt this a horror game

oh dear flying heads

0,14later Kencolt
Why does Phase4 have a + by his name?
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I wanted to take it before I knew they'd take it too
You know, if you say to some "I'm a brony." they say "What?" with a blank look on their face. You then proceed to explain that you like MLP:FiM. Why not just start with "I like MLP:FiM"?
Alister: incredibly bad idea man. you need to do something because YOU want to do it. NOT BECAUSE OF ANYONE ELSE
But yeah, never believe love just happens.
Night kencolt
Whats so scarry about it

oh
killerpony7733: So you dont not want to be called a brony, but you dont want to be called one either? Are you indifferent?
Alister then it would be okay but really never do something only because of friends
BronyCody: I explained I wanna doit for the money.
sagas: It's why I don't like fan art which draws the ponies on two legs.
so.....
11,01We're currently livestreaming a 30-minute art challenge at Bronyfunds.
Money is a valid reason to take a job.

TheGreatAndPowerfulT: By that I meant, we might go to the same college
Art challenge?
DocSane: I can agree with that. I also find humanized ponies undesireable
Randomnerd: I don't think it is.
Why he want your soul?
sagas: See, I really love the humanized ones.
as time goes on, I have the sneaking suspicion that my mother is trying to make me murder her.
eh, I find nothing wrong with humanized ponies
Om: he lieks souls
anthro ponies do freak me out a bit though

Alister: Okay, why is Twi your favorite character?
dat economy tho...
DocSane: See: My little pony tales.
Were I smart, I'd have gone into STEMM.
DocSane: I know. I just find that making them human takes away from the innocence of the show.
HarrySack: well when I can't watch the stream right I am.
Randomnerd: But that could happen to anyone, regardless of pursuing your dream or not.
RAWRity: lol
And every time she bangs on that fucking thing, I want to kill her just a tiny bit more.

Epic hand to hand combat there
So why does he have to punch the fat one?

and then epic SHOTGUN TO FACE combat
To save ammo, I'm guessing
Shizuka: Don't die bro
BuckWheat: My brother is an Electrical Engineer and is married. That's all I need to know about the choices I made.
Shotgun shells: apply directly to the forehead

BuckWheat: I didn't fail -I'm just going to have to go back to school and get a real degree.
I'm so bored, so I'm just gonna throw things around the chat.
DocSane: Twi is my favorite character because I too used to be intraverted and cynical. I opened up to some friends like her and it really was a good thing. Other than that , I just think I can realte to her by her OCD tendencies, her Modesty vs Trixie and other examples.
/me throws SuperBrony64

ALister: Ta-daa. You empathize with a character and identify with her.
RAWRity: Lol, well I mean your dream has to be rational and not Illegal.
Alister: Amen to that. Save for the modesty. I've been told that my ego can be quite vocal, but it's probably just to cover up my insecurities.
Where do ALL these bronies keep coming from?

/me regards Shizuka with more than a bit of caution
killerpony7733: I guess but for all intensive purposes you are a brony. Something is stopping you from wanting to consider yourself a part of the community. Maybe its denial. Maybe its embarassment. Maybe its conotations you have about bronies
otakon: well you see, when a stallion and a mare love eachother very much...
Hiiyo Bronystate
hello
my goal is to be the very best and cathc them all!!!!
Alister: I think this is also one of the few shows that just portrays girls as people and not obsessed with "girl things."
DocSane: But I try to see my problems as my own rather than compare them with cartoon characters
hi SunderlandPony89!
Shizuka: and thus the PUGILIST EXCERCISE PROGRAM was born

Whenever I see someone say "ADRIAAAAAAAAAAAAAN", I always think of Sexy Commando Gaiden...but I know it's a reference to some movie.
Shizuka punching zombies is now a meme.

/me grabs a hunting rifle
RAWRity: Please, sir, you must have a brohoof for that. /)
DocSane: true. One way they break sterotype is violence let me explain. In most shows , slap stick physical humour will happen to a male. But in this show, the Mane 6 get hurt alot. Twi is almost the show's official punching bag
yay babies
RAWRity: :o and thats how equestria was made?
Randomnerd: menace? Drug dealers serve a big purpose in our entertainment industry. Who else can we have to be the bag guy in after school specials?
Reikim: (\
Like becoming a Billionaire, possible? Yes, but highly improbable. But if you aim high enough, you might become a millionaire instead. Shoot for the moon, land on a star.
Alister: I think, in many ways, the media encourages the idea that there are these unscalable walls between genders. This show is unusual in that gneder has almost no bearing on anything.
BuckWheat: It's physically impossible to land on a star.
WindWhistler: Well, not for long.
WindWhistler: Hasn't stopped me.
RAWRity: there are kids on this site, that was unnessicary
TO THE SUN
Alister: Which is common in "boy shows" but almost unheard of in "girl shows."
How much longer does she have left in this game?
Don't take it literally lol.
WindWhistler: Dwight, is that you?
BuckWheat: or, you aim to become a billionaire but are so afwul at it, you end up completely broke and you hang yourself from the rafters of your shitty apartment.
indwhistler: what about kirby
sagas: pretty sure she's near the end
I dont think I've ever heard a gun make a more blatent "Pew pew pew" sound that that one
TO URANUS!
Petrified_Discord: Explain
Alister: Which, more often than not, wallow in their extreme girliness.
cachi01: I see what you did there
RAWRity: That's a risk you'll just have to take.
DocSane: I always see people as individuals so I 100 % agree with that.
because, as it turns out, finances are a little more difficult than aiming.
SunderlandPony89: and THAT is why id makes good shooters...except Rage that was kind of a let down didn't even look that good.
11,02O.O
DocSane: Does saying that make me seen bi-sexual ?

Fat zombies are best zombies

RAWRity: I may be being naive, but some of the greatest things in the world were accomplished by naive people.
Punchout VS Mr hippo
OH GOD KILL IT WITH FIRE
Alister: no thanks, only into girls.
its CTHULU!
Taaaake oooon meeeee (take on me)
Alister: So, anyway, I think another thing that male fans find appealing about this show is that it works to demystify girls as this mysterious "other" and present them as relatable across gender lines.
Besides, what could you DO on a star? It's just a ball of fire...not like the moon or anything.
AW HELL NO LEVEL FATTY DETECTED!
otakon: Too bad for you
AW HELL NO DETECTED, DEPLOY PIES!
Maybe you can get them to diet first. Make 'em easier to kill?
Is he teleporting or are there multiple?
Why do you send little baby men?
So...when did we bring bisexuality into this?
sagas: multiples, the game likes to throw pairs at you
sagas even if there were i would share it with you but i know myself and i really just think i can't find a meaning to the title brony i just can't to me its that simple
Reikim: no idea
(Can you all tell that I've been putting WAAAAY too much thought into analyzing this show?)
DocSane: Yeah , I always was shy with the fairer sex , but since this year , I feel like I know my female friends a lot more
Shizuka: no ammo! USE THE MACHINEGUN!
Man, I leave for five seconds - FIVE - and I come back and suddenly otakon is asserting his heterosexuality.
Petrified_Discord: Do you have an answer for me?
499/500 ammo ''GUYS COVER ME ! I HAVE TO RELOAD''
Reikim: what asserting? I like girls that's all I can say on that matter.
Alister: lol
Running out of ammo!!!
WindWhistler: I was making more of a joke, I didn't really think you would care this much, so why don't you just give my answer for me, 'kay? :)
DocSane: I was thinking that, but I have a feeling that that thought is hypocritical considering how deep I try to analize videogames :P
killerpony7733: Well are you parts of other non-brony communities on the internet?
0,14Air scrubber?
BuckWheat: no, some of the most hilarious things were accomplished by naive people. The important things in life were accomplished by people working long, hard hours and becoming the best they possibly could in their field of interest while making numerous sacrifices in order to accomplish even a modicum of what they set out to do.
Reikim: He's doin g that because I was flirting with him
sagas i'm a furry for one
FIRE ALL OF THE BULLETS
otakon: I wasn't even implying anything, so I'm going to apply some Freudian logic to that.
Being optimistic and spouting yearbook quotes doesn't actually help you acomplish anything.
Petrified_Discord: It was a joke? I couldn't tell. :/ Really, I don't care too much about the topic either, I was just making a point.
Reikim: >Freud
>Logic
Reikim: okay... I have no idea what ya mean by that
>HA
otakon: You knouw you want it filly
RAWRity: But there were people who also ignored what society claimed was impossible and worked their hardest to make it possible.
Shizuka what the?
RAWRity: /) Now explain Freud to otakon here.
123
RAWRity: "Logic merely allows one to be wrong with authority."
killerpony7733: Well why do you call yourself a furry? What purpose/meaning does it serve to you?
Alister: enope, give me a tall girl that is curvy and nice.
I see...so that's how they'll use iPads in the future....
otakon: :| ok , but if you change your mind
Freud's logic was "I'll ask somebody a question, then talk about how they want to fuck everything."
hold them right in front of their eyes..
13so apparently, there's an easter egg here out of frame of a sprite of the original chaingun guy
13but i've never been able to find the cutscene room in th emap
Shizuka: neat
OH NO MAGIC :O
I wonder if everyone in Doom 3 has glasses because of that.
SunderlandPony99: All over the world, there are straight teens and young adults who are suddenly wanting to harmlessly break some gender barriers.
enter the tentacle rapist zombies from hell
Yay demonic possesion!
Petrified_Discord: and psychological findings allow one to show that Freud was making shit up as he went along.

0,14Stripey Butts?

Sam Harding, no! :(

Look at that interactive environment!
don't do it

DocSane: I'd say. Turning quite a few heads as well :P
RAWRity: BUT he opened the field to a lot of people. He was an idiot, yes, but at least give him credit for publicizing the field.
Funfact: your partner is dead.
SunderlandPony99: Seriously, prior to discovering this show, could you ever have imagined wanting My Little Pony toys?
So was that his friend who got turned into a monster?
killerpony7733: the fan-fics, the conventions
I knew it!
yes spriggals half lie

killerpony7733: the merchandise
sagas no cause in the end it all stems from MLP FIM on the other hand furries stems from a whole other idea
uckin f key
sagas not a show or anything but a idea
Reikim: he publicized the field, and then set it back over 100 years by purporting his findings as facts despite having no actual scientific proof for what he suggested.
DocSane: I dont think a single brony out there would of even considered touching anything related to MLP outside of extreme circumstances, and I'm no exception
lol
hello peoples :D /) anyone?
RAWRity: Okay, yes, I'll concede that. But hey, at least he gave us something to joke about.

Well , Finals begin tommorow. My body is ready
Damn this stress... making me fall asleep at the keyboard
DocSane: I wonder why they can't make Wind Whistler properly. Her mane isn't YELLOW.
"People get angry because they secretly want to fuck their parents." "Interesting theory, what experiments let you to this conclusion?"

0,14also, Reikim, get it, I hear it's good
http://memegenerator.net/instance/20389583?urlName=freud&browsingOrder=New&browsingTimeSpan=AllTime
DocSane: D'aww, that sucks. I gots no moneys for a fanmade plushie
killerpony7733: I dont see how. I feel like the show itself stems from a group of ideals. Ideals that we happen to channel through the show
BuckWheat: ideas that he never tested to see if they were true.
SunderlandPony99: They're not that hard to make yourself.
Ha, I'd get Lollipop Chainsaw just to hear Twilight as a dumb blonde cheerleader who chops up zombies.
Chainsaw > All the powers of hell
05is she in the garage rigth now?
Let us not forget Freud gave us the wondeful idea of "Penis Envy"
RAWRity: But those ideas were still proven right by people.
sagas the idea came from the show itself and thats where all bronies see the reason of it
SunderlandPony99: A friend of mine took a class on plushie-making to cash in on the pony plushie gold mine.
BuckWheat: Probably because they believed it to be true.
05hey Shizuka! post alpha or pre monorail?
Reikim: I chose to hold of on getting Lollipop Chainsaw due to its length. Witcher 2 was to tempting for me considering its length and what I've heard of it. Will be picking it up sometime though
So apparently I accidentally threw us into a discussion about psychology.
BuckWheat: but not by him. If I just shouted out every theory and idea I had about everything, I'd have to get one right eventually.
Wrek: She got off a train.
Psychology, fuck yeah! :D
05during monorail then! yes!
05im in time for my fav part
RAWRity: Silly foal, that's Politics, not Science.
http://memegenerator.net/instance/14599087?urlName=freud&browsingOrder=New&browsingTimeSpan=AllTime
My key point is: Freud came up with ideas that sounded like they MIGHT make sense. He then did nothing to verify them and instead just told people he was right.
DocSane: That's... not a bad idea actually. Only thing is, I have no idea where I could take a sowwing class. None in the town where I live unfortunately
Wrek what part? 6_9

BuckWheat: I present to you: TIME CUBE
It's okay guys, we can buff out those scratches :)
When are you getting the BFG?
BuckWheat: confidence doesn't make them true. And seeing as nearly every theory he had has been discredited by ACTUAL psychologists, I'd say confidence is most definitely NOT key in this situation.
Wrek: you're an artist right ? do you take requests ?
what does bfg stand for
Hold on... how does he climb using on ly his feet?
05Alister: form time to time
big fucking gun
Diglett: Big Fucking Gun
Wrek The cote?
I have never thought about that, before.
brb gotta eat
so who else is listening to the waltz of the flowers?
Wrek: I'll take that as a not right now
Because part of being a psychologist means trying your damndest to be objective and scientific about what you're doing.
^
RAWRity: Freud was the first in his field.
05in other words RAWRity: appearing insane to the common man
Randomnerd: a field of bullshit, yes.
He was wrong about a lot of things, but he was the first person to even ask the question.
So you're saying Freud says everyone wanted to their mums because he wanted to bang his mum ?
yes
Dat klaxon
brb guys, restroom
RAWRity: Let me guess. You read xkcd.
Randomnerd: no, he was not.
Bloody Chainsaw!
Randomnerd: no, I take psychology and do research.
Alister: That's one hell of a deep question :P
Apparently, Freud was afraid of ferns. Weird bit of trivia.
So mfw I decide to watch Rah Xephon, and it turns out to be an Evangelion clone in reverse.
sagas got nothing to say back then?
woah
Alister: I'm saying he THOUGHT everybody wanted to bang their mom, and never bothered to test it.
lol nope
05what bothers me is that the arch viles arent in doom 3 as they were in the other ones
Reikim: Meh, Rah Xephon's better than EVA in my opinion.
Zombie: So I was telling fred about the game last night and----*small can lands on ground* what th---*explode*
RAWRity: You can be ambivalent on Freud all you want, but the truth is, some of his stuff has shaped the world of psychology and has had a profound impact. Even if a lot of his stuff was babble or even if he was throwing random stuff out there. He still had to think about the theory and tell it to the world.
RAWRity: Cool then. Who would you say was the first "proper" pyschologist.
RAWRity: I said "in reverse" yes? Besides, I haven't finished..
I'm not challenging you, I'm actually curious.
Randomnerd: fuck no.
/me gets crushed by the wall texts
ugh
killerpony7733: We all were drawn to this show for variouse reasons. All are ideals that symbolize what being a brony is all about
Alister: Sorry, but I had a lot to say
quit startin' sagas
BuckWheat RAWRity Allow me to put this debate to bed: Most of Freud's theories have been disproven, but they did serve as a foundation for modern psychology and are still referenced.
Psychology as a science easily predates Freud. The first psychologist, in terms of laboratories and it actually being science instead of Philosophy, would be Wundt
RAWRity: Thank you.
13so this is ominous..
killerpony7733: whether its something wanting to enjoy something feminin, innocent, or otherwise

05good luck in delta Shizuka!
*someone
13:3
Personally , my favorite psychologist is Pavlov
i was dinged....i think'
13but first we must get through emergency power only all delta operations suspended
He did actual reschearch
Petrified_Discord: Freud Pony. Nice
Alister: He had a good Dog.
Shamroc: I think Shizuka was wondering if you were still here.
05i dare you to fist only the first hell knight you meet >:3
BuckWheat: sure did
I never thought I would see Pikachu make several appearances on a music related Blog TV show
but I ddi
WindWhistler: nah i was here then...
*did
One thing I have to say about Rah Xephon: the mech designs are damn cool.
it was kirz
/me sits back and eats strawberries
well it was Pikachu in a way
roger roger what you're victor victor
Pavlov, that poor son of a bitch.
Wrek: that came out sounding wrong
I think Schrodinger's cat could beat Pavlov's dog in a fight anyday haha.
RAWRity: What do you mean ?
0,14Wrek, you only do that on the 5th date
8,6BuckWheat: but how could you tell?
BuckWheat: Well that's a given since Cats > Dogs
Robert Price
kirzstryfe: through observation
He spends years as a psychologist, and all anybody remembers is his dog.
8,6but once you observe the cat, it's no longer Schrodinger's cat, it's just a cat
BuckWheat: only if it's alive.
so it could only win 50% of the time.
Alister: what do I mean about what?
8,6or a dead cat, depending on the circumstances
kirzstryfe: Or a dead cat, depending.
RAWRity: I remember him , I attribute how some people gain fetishes to his conditioning theory
eww
Alister you're gross
Thanks for that Alister.
kirzstryfe: well then the poison would kill the dog too
Alister: Ah, but he did more than just the classical conditioning stuff.
13i like how the emergency lights are designed
13very spooky level
Alister: Is it bad that I'm curious on this conditioning theory?
sagas: IT has to be a cat
kirzstryfe: The Bell is the dog's weakness.
killerpony7733: I hope I didnt chase you away with my wall of text
cats ae more mathmaatic
Have sensitive information? Why not audio-log?
SunderlandPony89: Not really. We've all been conditioned one way or another.
13also yes i'm exaggerating reactions~
sagas Can I get the cliff notes?
05though my favorite areas are either the waste facilities in RoE or later delta
13i know where the jumps are
05Shizuka :3
granted, the Dog experiment was easilly his most infulential one, he did other stuff.
SunderlandPony89: Conditioning someone to have a reaction to something will make him react the way wanted.
sagas as is aid i am very simple person when it comes to a why i don't go deeper then that but in the end i'm like one i just don't use the title it techinally makes me one so is there reason to call me one when i simply don't want the title but just want to be a part of it?
sagas said*
... Is this Doom 3?
no
0,14BronyState: Where we watch Doom 3 and discuss deep stuff
It's like how "A-ha" are only remembered for Take On Me in teh states, but had huge success in europe.
0,14XD
11/10c/8p.
killerpony7733: okay i can and will respect that
SaxyPretender: I lol'd.
lol
O-O
O_o*
RAWRity, what about The Living Daylights?
R-Dash5000: why are you stating the time?
Shizu! its witch! dont help her!
I wish I could say spontaneously funny stuff...
-lol-
Give the witch ice cream!
Alister: Huh. I can... kinda see how that would work in some situations
Its a dj
13the weighted companion datalinker will never threaten to sic hell on you
Shizuka nothing can make diglett flinch
BECAUSE I AM THE R-DASH 5000. CRUSH. KILL. DESTROY. SWAG.
Lol
Magic.mov
Hot damn
SunderlandPony89: I know it did for me. I don't expect you to want an explanation ?
But I'd say that Schrodinger's cat is the Smells Like teen Spirit of the Science world.
Well everypony, I'll be on later :)
R-Dash5000: and a handy clock
bye Panda-
Bye Panda- :3
Alister I respectfully disagree. I've experienced some things starting very early on before there was a chance for any conditioning to take place.
guys, I think I'm gonna get out of here for the night
0,14later Panda-
night Panda-
Alister: Is this related to the fetish thing you brought up earlier? Either way, I dont mind
05btw shizu remember how trippy the later hell/delta merges are? x3
PandaDash?
/me hugs Panda- goodbye
Shizuka: In the words of shizu :isnt that just like a friend, once your dead takes your stereo"
Shizuka: thanks for the stream dear
Yeah, because you might be too hooked to the stream to notice.
See ya Panda-
otakon: i said later silly :D
Uh oh. Trippy stuff is coming up?
otakon: Dream of Ponies
Panda-: oh
/me hugs everypony
11,01Ask Palette Swap mod is now in call on stream. ~yay~
sagas i by all standards am a brony but again i don't use the title so why argue with that? as long as i interact with the community its as if i am one
Panda-: well I'M going to bed myself actually
Nittany_Discord: ncie
otakon: What's with the "dear"? It makes you sound kinda creepy. :o
C-C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER
otakon and metal gear
Night all take care
Night otakon
Goodnight otakon :)
WindWhistler: I call girls dear, bad habit I know.
See ya otakon
good day otakon
Night, otakon :)
0,14later otakon
gnight otakon
/me just wants to say the opposite of everyone else
night guys, take care(again) and SOMEONE wish me some luck getting a job.
05video linkup requested Shizuka.
sagas long discussion was long :O
otakon: Don't singe the bed. Actually, you should look into putting out that fire...
bye otakon :3
0,14good luck, otakon
good luck otakon
take it easy kenne
otakon: i will try :3
Shizuka: your not save there.......but then again your not safe anywhere
Reikim2: why the 2 ?
Hey, you can't just ask people to wish you luck. I ask people to listen to me when I'm talking, and how often does that happen?
13the light flicker works really really well with the HDR effects
/me is very confused right now in his life
Alister: When I DC the system doesn't properly register it.
ok
sagas whys that? 6_9
... How did I get on the Pinkie Pie server? I'm in Vancouver for heavens sake xD
killerpony7733: Im having confusing emotions right now
*heaven's
lol
But I have to say this theory is based on personal experience only
See? It happened again!
sagas ah ok any reason.....for it?
Hey, if we were to ever stream Sherlock on here, would anyone object?
sagas: Redundant adjective is redundant.
/me complains
Wait, I know what the problem is: my client is based in Germany.
Do you like The Aquabats super show?
Reikim: :D
Alister Fair point, but I don't quite get how that ties into fetish development.
I want to eat an orange now...
R-Dash5000 Never saw the appeal, personally.
05i like oranges, thye are tasty, henceforth i ahs fetish and wants to sex the orange.
killerpony7733: Im feeling the desire to be intimate with men, but I feel heterosexual
Oh my
i know
Wrek: That's not my point
Did you watch the AO TV show last monday?
R-Dash5000: no
Alister I don't mind personally, but I'm not so sure about everyone else.
pirvate chat ?
sagas well i'm pansexual though maybe a bit Bi in that too but i more or less choose a person for personality
Wrek: :(
05just messing with you Alister
Alister Sure.
Alister No idea how.
Oh Wrek...
05i wanted orange. it gave me lemon lime
Wrek: whoa man...thats...a little creepy..even for jokeing
13today on shizu tyson's punchout!
Remember, The Annoying orange tv show is on mondays at 8:30/7:30c on Cartoon Network.

DOOOM doom do-doom,

05you sure you pressed the right button?
dat kick?
lol
The citris would burn.
Dat shotgun
05I am certain!
Wrek was it the maintenance guy?
sorry shizu, a shotgun blast to the head should be instadeath (except boss mobs) =p
05your fingerm ight have slipped
all I can think of is Shizuka's character saying the same things as Heavy when he has his fists out.
05it was the mantinence guy, he knows i liek orange
Wrek why are you talking to yourself?
05so you think the staff has somekind of plot?
!
killerpony7733: The thing is I feel the need to be intimate with men, but no desire for sex. I feel the desire for sex with women, but no desire for intimacy with them
0,14those guys are trying to get aHEAD in life
8,6Shizu and her shotgun
Shizuka is just too good at this. I'm starting to become afraid of her.
Wrek Forgive my interruption my vision is augmented
/me groans at Saxy
SaxyPretender: bu dum, tsh
/me smacks SaxyPretender for that bad joke
SaxyPretender: *rim shot*
05atleast itsa way for us to know when its not paul
Pew pew pew
0,14:3
Dat air vent
lol Wrek was quoting Agent Navarre and Gunter Herrman from Deus Ex 1...
sagas thats....interesting
So is there a story here, or just more zombies?
Midnight_Tempest eeyup
05stick with the prod, prod with the prod. jsut in case though, we're police.
Saxy and they are bloody unlucky after life.
Sounds like the Joker
damn I forgot there were [Enter]s in that
13i'm not sure if i like the new cacodemon squeaking like that...
Reikim: I see this game as I see L4D, IE Zombies > Story
13what am i saying, it's just as cute as ever! SQUEE!
0,14...
Um
0,14wut
huh.
Shizuka: :D
Should I start running yet?
Wrek i....i.....i thought you were a gep gun
I'm so boooooored
05Shizuka: too bad they tried to merge the pain elemental and cacodeamon from start and jsut dissed the pain elemental in the end
/me scoots around the room with her legs.
kirzstryfe: now if only she had aa katana
killerpony7733: I feel I wont be fully satisfied with either and I fucking hate it
I didn't know they were making an Ender's Game film.
MLG
13:3
sagas hmmm...
I'm a cat! >:3
God forbid Shizuka starts thinking Bronystate is cute, considering what she's doing to these demons...
05OMG Shizuka! an IMP!
killerpony7733: I just feel very confused
BFG
hello everypony
Doom doom doo doom doom, DOOMY-DOOMY-DOOM, doom do do DOOM, Do do DOOM, doomy-doomy-doomy, Doom doom doom THE END
13hey guys, i think the reactor core is offline
LightTrooper105: Sup bro /)
Howdy LightTrooper105 :3
13am i supposed to follow safety procedure orange?
Shizuka: OH NOES
DeadpoolDash: Shut up Grr!
Shizuka: How do you know?
Heya LightTrooper105
Please follow-
13and what is safety procedure orange anyway?
Shizuka: Nah, I think you want to follow safety procedure green.
Iron_Edge (/
I never knew there was a code orange.
eat oranges
0,14Mmm, oranges
gg sagas
/me pets Polydunami
lol
Im wondering how the hell they're going to sell the end of Ender's Game to a regular audience. That shit is DARK.
05Shizuka: saftey procedure orange includes beign annoying
and laughing creepyly
/me purrs :3
Safety prodecure Grape is better than Safety prodecure Orange
RAWRity: Woah woah woah. I'm sensing you're referring to some kind of adaptation here. Details?
Whats Ender's Game?
/me strokes Polydunami?
Reikim: they're making an Ender's Game movie
does that make you purr more?
:D
I prefer safety procedure lemon
/me hisses >:<
Shizuka do you have the BFG?
And I'm wondering how they'll handle the ending.
Polydunami :O....easy
RAWRity: Hm, my interest is piqued...also /) because that book is one of my all-time favourites.
RainbowJack: If she did, I think she'd be using it.
wtf is that
Wait, I thought you were someone else. Sorry :3
13nope
05Shizuka: or when you get to read about the monsters origins in the dissection area
13not til next level, or the one after
05:D
Polydunami ah :D
13forget if it's before teleport
Shizuka, I think that JUST MAYBE you have too many weapons.
I wonder if like, instead of the actual ending, they instead have Ender crash his spaceship into the queen's ship, saving the world, while shouting "USA! USA!"
monsters
/me hugs Polydunami
/me is hugged :3
lol
lol dat jump
RAWRity: I'd kill the producers myself, but it's a possibility.
why does he box them?
inb4 the ending is like ME3
13punch dat plot~
Jumpin zombies!
Why.
EGAD
Poor zombie
Woah
05you could say Shizuka... (glasses) packs alot of punch
WindWhistler: actually, there are some striking simularities to the ME3 ending and Ender's Game
so...punching a zombie somehow makes all its skin melt off?
/me aneurysms from the bad pun
0,14YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
I'm pretty much only listening to this game at this point, and that has got to be one of the cheapest punching sfx I've heard in a while...
Wrek: booooo :D
Didn't know it was possible to punch the flesh and organs off a zombie
RISE AND SHINE MR FREEMAN.
hello
dun dun dun
Are you saving lost souls, Shizuka? :3
Most notable: both end with an enormous massacre of an entire planet.
damn you CSI: Miami
RAWRity: So do the Metroid games, but we're not bringing those into this.
0,14those guys are losing their heads over Shizuka
inb4 Other M rage
hey what does the +tn mean
I liek Doom >:3
I think it'd be more similar if the character you're playing as isn't even alive
SunderlandPony89: Nah, we avoided that.
