Nick, you are a 14Fearow.
03in theory
03if you were to DRC everything a bazillion times
OHAY LETS HAIL JUN WHEN HE TALKS
03would it all "even" out?
03like make the uh
03like the waveform look completely solid
03XD
Bye everypony :)
http://bronysith.deviantart.com/art/5-cheese-pasta-with-Chimmycherry-sauce-wat-305739811?q=gallery%3Abronysith%2F36810665&qo=7 this was a great meal
why not just apply a ridiculous gain once?
03that too
03but yet it still didn't completely even out
03like when watching the FFT
03it still jumps up and down
does the waveform look like a brick?
anyway BYE!
hay all my friends
hey guys. how is everyone?

you're applying modifications 2 the time domain
LOL
/me is watching The Legend of Korra
orly
which episodes
03I just did a hard limiter of 150dB to this song
*episode
03also, does it make any difference if you change the "seek" time from 7ms to something else?
seems legit
Lawl
mooooodead
Been busy
:o
, like a multiband compressor (A3 has one). these are commonly used by studios to jack up the volume of the songs another way
03well
03I noticed that with songs like
03even using hard limiting, the beginning & end parts still sound quieter
is
sligthly
AGC/riding
nter> also, does it make any difference if you change the "seek" time from 7ms to something else? < do you mena lookahead?
:P
9th is good
Brb, gonna play Torchlight(no casz for diablo:()
03yeah
*cash
03and well
03can you do AGC in a DAW?
yes-ish]
Yeah, probably last time I ranted about it was a while ago
\lolwut
03yep
03Rock Band mixdown
03that's how fricking awesome those masters are
/me runs
03I'm sure the album version would sound like utter crap
I haven't really seen any other than 9/10/11
10th
03LOL the results of fade-outs
Because MOTHERFUCKING TENNANT
Silly, there's no 11th.
:P
whee
no, square waves are the loudest
Exactly
03hm
And how the Matrix isn't a trillogy
:>
03but sine waves are close?
trilogy*
well, depending on how you do the loudness
I also enjoyed the MAtrix sequals
/me prepares lightsaber
03LOL.
03so I made a 1kHz square wave
triangle waves are inbetween
03well
03Audacity only does square, sine, sawtooth
generate sine, triangle, and square waves in A3 and look at the FFT
sine has one harmonic, square waves have many more
03hm
no
Haven't seen Olly today
saw is kinda like a skewed triangle
03http://i.imgur.com/whDpN.png
And dunno where Nail is either
triangle is symmetric
BRB EVERYPONY

dari well Olly literally just got on skype
Oh, hah
03but I want rollercoaster!
/me apparently cant enjoy sequals that werent as good as there previouse counterparts, but can still be enjoyed
/me runs
/me on principle
03well
03that would just be a sine wave with varying amplitutes, right?
03*d
stream*
It was a good day
there are some programs which allow you to draw waves yourself, but if you want to make something audiable which lasts for more than 1ms, itll take aaages if you draw the whole thing manually
And there was much rejoicing
03...LMAO
03this preset in CEP
03called "out of control"
03funniest FFT ever
i boosted this song in A5 rite?
with 50dB boost in limiter, i can hear the cymbals pumping & not very nice
03Haha this is hilarious
03the FFT looks like some jello
I already said
03I am far more amused than I should be XD
Oh nvm
03you mean FFT?
03I'm using CEP, not A5
i know
03it doesn't do anything
ok
03well
A4 doensn't have
I*
03go in A3 and do generate - wave, set to 1000Hz base, 30 seconds, "out of control"
03and play it
03fricking hilarious

yes it is xD
03the FFT is laggy as frick and it gives me warnings about my audio drivers
Pond is easily worst companion
03so yeah, CEP ftw
She's such a bitch

03with mine, I can just pull each key off, clean under it, stick it back on

at least partially
03and am majorly disappointed
What's wallor mean?
I like pie.
O: was it- okay
03with how they ended the series
03:(
I was going to ask if it was good but I guess not
03LOL
03well
03given the comment you left to that picture I sahred
03I was under the impression that you had seen it
Only parts
03ah
And the first episode
03the first season is good
03second season is good until the end
03>_>
Oh, that sucks.
03I mean, it was a logical way to end the series, it was just sad
03and I didn't like it
03:P
03I won't say more as >spoilers
Ypu can tp
okay
XD
03got any recommendations?
03I want another series to watch
Hmm
03Preferrably not very long
Uh
03300+ episodes, no thank you
I was told that Rurouni Kenshin was good, but I don't know
Case Closed is
good
but the episodes are usually quite stand-alone if the mystery's understood
I'm sorry to have worried you!
unless it's like a special episode where two are one
/me feels clean
03but I'd rather just sit down and watch a series
03since both of them are doable in a day :P
03each, not toal
03*total
Hmm, 95 episodes
XD
Hello everypony
Fair enough. Can't say I really know anything about what's actually going on but now I know, barbarians need regen.

03actually that one sounded interesting
03how long is that series though?
Stach? As in moustache?

Moustache the gems.

Egg out of friggin' nowhere

03I dunno
02Aight

03most of the cheaper ones have onboard cards

Didn't that ....just REMOVE everyrhing good about the Aleisn 2?
Yes
Correct
Common sequal problem, destroying all continuity from the previous movie
/me ransprawls

/me splashes the tea in my face
It's quite fine, yes.

Hey guys

03you mean netbooks?
03and well, the two popular sizes are 13" and 15"
Does that mean that they don't have the same special effects budget as the previous movie
03it's just a matter of personal prefernce really
03but for now I'll do the 15" ones since there's more of them
I'm back
they DIDN'T MAKE IT
HEYA

Wait, it hatched from her in the first version. Now she just falls in.
Fun fact: This whole movie was just a dream while she was asleep in the escape ship from the last movie
This movie did not exist; it was some bad dream that Ripley had
I rate harshly on dives
Okay my interne lagged there, did the alien burst out of her chest? If not then this is the special edition
she had the prescious

And then Ripley woke up in a cryo tube.

"Worst dream ever"

Like becoming a Billionaire, possible? Yes, but highly improbable. But if you aim high enough, you might become a millionaire instead. Shoot for the moon, land on a star.
TO THE SUN
Don't take it literally lol.
I dont think I've ever heard a gun make a more blatent "Pew pew pew" sound that that one
because, as it turns out, finances are a little more difficult than aiming.

Look at that interactive environment!

Really, why do they have to hold their computers up to their faces? I know it's supposed to be like some sort of menu, but that's kinda ridiculous.

Concerning Freud
http://memegenerator.net/instance/20389583?urlName=freud&browsingOrder=New&browsingTimeSpan=AllTime
SunderlandPony99: They're not that hard to make yourself.
05is she in the garage rigth now?
Let us not forget Freud gave us the wondeful idea of "Penis Envy"
Psychology, fuck yeah! :D
05during monorail then! yes!
05im in time for my fav part
http://memegenerator.net/instance/14599087?urlName=freud&browsingOrder=New&browsingTimeSpan=AllTime
My key point is: Freud came up with ideas that sounded like they MIGHT make sense. He then did nothing to verify them and instead just told people he was right.
13so much for staying on the train >>
lol
throw momma from the train!
dat doom
05gona be awesome

Apparently, Freud was afraid of ferns. Weird bit of trivia.
