why 2 windows?
I suspect because of some of the crazy DRM/control they use
seems legit
DRM?
Oy.

I think... (please note, I THINK) they "freeze" the game when you alt-tab, and it doesn't resume until it registers another "alt tab"
but normal alt-tabbing doesn't trigger the event the first time

0,14also, I see sound the alarm
10,02I'm in danger of not being able to graduate this semester ;___;

13oh no :<
0,14and music from Anarchy Reigns pops into my head
/me 13hugs SuperBrony64
0,14oh man, that sucks, SB ;n;
/me reluctantly hugs SuperBrony64...
10,02One failed class it it messes you up go :(
10,02and*
D: Oh no!
/me wonders if it has anything to do with staying up til 4am most weekdays
10,02good*
10,02Wow, I failed that statement >_<
10,02Nope, nothing to do with it.
I have hope SB64 <3
10,02But the thing is, I need to take the class this semester, but it's full
10,02I'm hoping to talk with the professor in that class to be able to take it this semester
huh, my code apears to be broken again. "SENTENCE 807: a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a"
10,02But I guess if I can't...it's not horrible...
I hope you can take it SB64 <3
10,02But I'll have to wait a WHOLE YEAR, just be able to take that same class again :/
I have hope.
0,14oh man
10,02But I'm glad I have all of you here ^_^
0,14hope it works out
13i am in that position sb..
10,02FYI: Introduction to Materials can be quite complicated :(
/me hugs SuperBrony64 "it'l all work out"
/me hugs Shizuka
I know that feel SB
/me hugs SuperBrony64 <3
/me hugs LadyCanary and Phase4
13i have only... two classes and an internship required before i could graduate, but they don't offer them every semester and i couldn't get them last semester
hopefully your professor is understanding sb
10,02Shizuka: Sorry to hear that :(
13yeah .-.
D:
10,02The biggest issue though is there is a waiting list to get into the class I need
10,02So chances are VERY low I won't be able to get in...
10,02But I'm hoping the fact that I'm a senior ready to graduate might be able to persuade the professor to think otherwise
10,02But if that fails
/me hugs everyone.
10,02I'm going to check other UCs and see if they offer that class over the summer...
10,02Either Berkeley or Davis would probably offer them...
10,02BUT, my life problems shouldn't be of concern to you all
/me 13hugs~
10,02All you should be worried about is WHERE IS MAH DAMN STREAM?!
/me hugs SuperBrony64 <3
not true sb, bronies are family

SuperBrony64: that would be the BEST THING EVER
10,02IKR!!
So much IKR, IKR?!
10,02Best part would be Applejack going into the water and having trouble swimming back up and then BAM, sea ponies
10,02Singing the remixed song
10,02And Applejack being like
10,02Uhhhh....okay
No sea ponies for the love of Celestia. NO SEA PONIES
10,02Then she gets up to the surface all dazed looking
0,14and then SB became a writer for G4 XD
10,02And Twilight asks, 'Hey AJ, what's up?'
The SKY?
10,02'Uhh....nothing :3'
Rainbow Dash, cause she is always up.
BAM sea ponies
why dey in da sky?
lol
0,14also, I love how TVTropes used alliteration or rhyming when describing Military Countries
10,02Twilight swims away while AJ realizes she is missing her hat, but then a Seapony sneaks it on her head.

10,02Here is one of my personal gameplay videos I uploaded ^_^
Was that Sonic Unleashed I spotted?
orly
DDR was a silly game.
:O?
DDR was the shit man
hmm okai!
SuperBrony64 - get the PS3/Xbox 360 version. The Wii version is vastly inferior. :P
10,02lol I have both 360 and Wii version :P
I played oni
Ah.
this is handheld.. ._.
How do the two compare then?
sonic unleashed?
I MUST GET IT
Because I sorta liked the game, but mostly because Robotnik had a fantastic showing. :P
00,10i will stick to patapon
wow hes got strong stomps
10,02I LOVE PATAPON :D
10,02But I'm not a fan of the PSP :P
HEY!
Oh patapon is epic
HAYYYY
SB
"Stubborn little pincushion, just DIE ALREADY!"
00,10i like my psp, it's porn on the go
PSP is good SuperBrony64
10,02I like it, but my PSP is the original one
i have patapon and patapon 2
release date for Wii is Feb. 13th
ikr Sumica
Plus, in Unleashed Robotnik came along with the Egg Dragoon. I.e. awesome.
10,02And it's old and I don't use it as much
And this music is brilliant.
i have this game for the ps2
Spagonia
yes 2
Unleashed was dreadful in my opinion
00,10did i say porn? i ment ponies >_>
10,02O U
lies
pornies
my favourite stage.........
hey Lasharus, you tried the PS2 version?
SuperBrony, Rhythm Heaven release date = Feb. 13th of this year.
too bad this is not from ps3 version
only the werehog levels in unleashed where horrible
Not yet Dken2021
no moonponi , just no.....
Surprisingly enough HeavyMetalDash - I sorta liked them. They dragged on too long, but they weren't that bad.
ow
I may get it, but only have a wii and PS2
00,10dat fail
I hated the CONCEPT of the Werehog, mind you.
The Warehog ruined the whole game for me
noooooo
too much god of war for you?
the werehog was pretty cool
Better.
Much better.
10,02All my videos still :3
meh - the very idea behind it is insane. :P
10,02But they suck ;____;
Plus, it might've been decent, but the voice acting ruined it COMPLETELY.
and a blue hedgehog the speed of light isnt?
u like sonic SuperBrony64 ?
10,02Yup ^_^
(Seriously, thank got they fired the idiot who acted Sonic at last)
:)
Lasharus you tried god of war?
Nope.
well the werehog levels are based on that
his god awful voice cting kinda grew on me
SuperBrony64 - if you like Sonic, I hope you don't mind relentless Robotnik-fanaticism. He IS the better character, after all. :p
the whole concept behind sonic is insane in its entirety think about it
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
omg
Total Halibut thinks Darksiders is better than God Of War.
moar sonic :D!
This, of course, is awesome.
YES
Sonic V. Rainbow Dash..
I'd pay for the tickets.
oh look, my favorite song of all sonic games
Sonic Adventure theme song :D!
fun fact: RBD can go faster than Sonic
my second fv
personally loved live and learn
live and learn was great too
10,02Luna is so cool :O
I dunno about the who's faster debate
to cool..
RBD can fo mach 10.
let's just say they are equal
almost 30% cooler
10,02I can't believe how cool My Little Pony has become O___o
my god final stage bgm..............
00,10Clearly Tails is best, he's as fast as sonic and can fly.
after soo many years..............
Bah Sumica.

Fair enough Phase4.
But oh well. It looks fun, and fans go crazy over them performances.
But I stand by my "what the absolute hell"

Okay that was my 3 minutes ta ta everybody~

lol
"AVANT, also known as AVANT street art guerrilla collective, was the artist group active in New York City from 1980 to 1984. By 1984..."
.....
....
ur doing it wrong...
especually the 3rd Season of Adventure Time. It's all over the place.
'Avant-garde (French pronunciation: [avɑ̃ɡaʁd]) means "advance guard" or "vanguard"' dafaq?
i fail to see how that apply's to adventure time
vanguard?
like in Phantasy Star?
"Avant-garde (French pronunciation: [avɑ̃ɡaʁd]) means "advance guard" or "vanguard"" should have read the rest of the sentence XD
whoops
'The term is used in English as a noun or adjective to refer to people or works that are experimental or innovative, particularly with respect to art, culture, and politics.' proper paste
ur doing it right XD
yeah. the first 2 seasons are appealing enough to everybody and generally make you feel good.
HeavyMetalDash: its not to... uh, 'avant-gade' for me, i love the strange and new. the humor is just not my type
Half the episodes in season 3 leave me vexed. Yeah, vexed is a good word.
Lol @ the avant garde discussion
heck, i watch pony. if thats not a little 'avant-garde' then i'm not sure what is
lol personally I've never seen a single episode of aventure time
HeavyMetalDash: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuTpF3zhH5s link if u got time
my hobbies generally eat up my time
hmmmmm
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuTpF3zhH5s http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuTpF3zhH5s
ow i love this bot....... btw can it have a cuter name?
huh, only does the first link
KetaminaDianePie: how bout KetaminaPie ?
HEY!
I'm not sure if this was a good episode to start out with.
or KetaPie ?
thats not cute at all!
its cuter
/me is getting tired and loopy
/me is melting.....
I just finished watching Adventure time
that was awesome
well movies chosen, Professor Layton and the Eternal Diva and Titan A.E

my window manager does not like me
hmmm... did you do something to piss it off?
no, it just likes to troll me
btw, 'window manager' is a linux thing. part of the display stuff
well, Xserver thing. either way
ah, i've never use linux. i don't think i know enough about coding
or is that the best way to learn about coding?
eh, ubuntu is about the same as windows to a novice, i would argue better
the way i learnd was the hard way, jump right in and start with archlinux
archlinux sounds hatefull
wich has no gui to start with
have to install your onw
own'
its actualy easy, just need to know how to do it
gui, that's the thing where you get to see what you're doing right?
"brown eyed girl"? how'd that get in my music collection
a 'gui' is the thing your used to on windows, graphical user interface
like the oposite of a disk operating system? I learned how to do one of those more or less...
the 'console' is a text mode interface, like 'dos'
i used it to play a game called "wizards"
then oregon trail
dos and unix shells are alot different, the latter for example can do multitasking
makes sense i guess
if you want to experiment with linux get ubuntu, super easy installer. it'l sit itself beside windows without isue
really?
you choose wich one you want at boot
i'm taking a tour of it now!
wait, can i run this on a flash drive!?!
O_O That game collection....what happens when the collector want to play a game from the back shelf? :P
yup
i've network booted it on machiens without hard drives
ALOT more flexable than windows
the install cd is actualy a fully featured install
it boots into a working os off the cd
"Knock on Wood" Where are these songs coming from

http://youtu.be/A4CofbOiKj0 dafaq?
dhehe
I take it nopony is streaming?
From an online radio show out of Austin, True Capitalist Radio, the host of the show is an angry guy raided by trolls on a daily basis and every time he rages, he kicks around a bunch of empty beer cans
http://youtu.be/YT21PkHtQeM this guy needs to calm down a little
I think Ghost is an idiot
he seems to be in on the joke, and is profiting off the fame
^ Yep
good for him i supose
/me wonders if he's secretly a #brony
probably
My favorite Ghost rages were Ghost the Hambone & Ghost is the new Rainbow Dash
never heard of that
Would you want to dream about ponies?
I'd never want to dream about ponies cuz waking up would be too disappointing.
xcanox: is deams of pony but having to wake not better than no dreams of ponies?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZSpZGRn0KM&list=FLR9HsA55ivKKU0EAQmXcQLQ& - Ghost is new Rainbow Dash. He just rages hard for six minutes over 15 seconds of nothing

Phase4: Yes, but how does one not wake?
I'm bored...
time do doodle.
i'ma code for a bit more then sleep
thanks Cypresswolf
You watched me, so curiously. Like a fool in the rain, burning what's left of me.
xcanox: that looks like a quote, what is it?
Last memories, too, from a time that I'll never be through. I've given all that I've got to give you. It's not enough but it's enough to make you numb.

anybody have any idea what happens when your "days to register" meter hits zero on mirc?
tvoie: somethign about it taking longer to start, thats it
huh... it usually takes awhile for it to start anyway
tvoie: Your name take my brain on a trip man.
tvoie: I think I got high trying to register how your name is spelled.
I don't know how I came across that link. maybe someone's tumblr.....
it's tee-voy
but i like this spelling better
WHEW!
Cypresswolf: what did i just watch
this seems to be taking awhile to download...though i guess it IS an operating system
hur
So last night, I played AssaultCube for the first time in months.
I watched a video of it on YouTube, saw someone I met before in the video, and...
Yeah. :D
i've honestly never heard of that
I'm not sure I can give you a link.
Let me check the rools.
Nope, can't.
Would recommend Google.
oh come on! we've got like twenty mods now and none of them seem to be here
So that's an excuse to break the rules?
This isn't /b/ ;D
when are you going to get another chance to do so?
tvoie: you can try it form the cd without installing anything, without a hard drive even
When the rools says so.
hmmm, wonder if i could get away with colour
i have to have the file somewhere for it to put it on the cd
lolololol
Phase4: That's what happens when you suggest breaking the rools.
:)
/me hit the wrong button, closed the bronystate page
i have to have the file somewhere for it to install it on the cd
ALL the Mods are asleep? ^_^
post human
Mods are asleep, post ponies?
^^^
i don't know. it would be one of those "planetary alinment" things
Pianos!
tvoie: not sure what you meen about files
Phase4: lol Why do you use qwebirc?
qwebirc?
XChat is much better.
I use XChat when I'm running Linux.
^
the one on the page is called lightirc, not sure where you got qwebirc from
o
allso i use it because :) makes a little twilight on my screen
it says i need a "percice-desktop*.iso" i don't have anything like that on my computer already, so it suggested i download it
Then download it, sucka!
i'm working on it
it's just... taking awhile
So I did a presentation on ponies at school.
how did that go?
Phase4: Smiles are ecchoes of our yesterdays.

Cypresswolf, that is my actual screensaver /)^3^(\
nope, we're keeping ourselves entertained
My internet went dead
Just came back
They're just imagining there's a stream going on.
But wasn't that the rule? Only picture links if stream is running?
Mine too, Turgle /)

They're mentally envisioning Winter Wrap Up playing in the video window.

Since they know every word by heart.

I need to prove Princess Mononoke runs at a higher fps than 10
otakon is always here... ALWAYS
dat dash and her wub face

...I give up, then.
otakon17: um, it is 10fps as far as i'm aware, leme check
There was this one episode that Dash made a face that reminded me of Mario.
took me about an hour to doodle and color that.
was hard seeing as I had to scavenge for those colors
No!
Thats so choppy!
Lol Phase4 how many posts do I have XD
It can't be.....

We're all bros here. =]

05she's been out to troll us ever since
05so far she's done a poor job
brb, doing some science
05even for lyra
Arentius: I do that way more than I should.
SCIENCE!
Obvious troll equates to fail troll.
we need to write a song... we'll call it the ballad of bronystate
Its cool! I wrote 100 words..then 5 min break..then i'll do another 100 >.>
srsly, you can't troll if it's obvious.
*cough*
and it will have all of our great strugles
And somehow still manage to get 10 or 12 (Amounts to A+ or A-).
Strike that.
Reverse it.
A- or A+.
Okay,
from the super hate bot attack, to the night of the crossovers, to lyra trying to troll us from other rooms
Ill be back
Okay, Schwarzenegger.
yeah If i don't hand it in tomorrow Kammerjunk I fail the unit >.>

its only 2500 words, I've already done 500 I got this
05then chores
05then shit
05then art :D
DUDE! LIKE! I'M USING CAps lock which is clearly against the rules.
:D
Arentius: It's not completely unusual that I do the essay the day before.
Sweet dreams, Wrek!
Kammerjunk : I'm already a week late I'm capped at the pass grade anyway
05oh and now you're making fun of me too xcanox? first you insult me, then you mock my ways.
Arentius: Somehow, I just don't have a problem writing.

I'm ban-fishing.
otakon17: My Science is done!
Dashie_Dashie: It's one of my favourite ponified remixes.

But I'm pulling out before anything serious goes down.
Wrek convinces ponies to do things to your OC! Don't trust him! *mock glares at Wrek*
otakon17: This is generated from your comments "for the plotperty of teh pirates"
And somehow, I managed to close Firefox without noticing.
What the hay.
otakon17: this too "i love that was fun and vitamins to know that was hanging there will thank you ll miss "
statisticly thats you
where are you generating these statements?
I'd fish for bans but with my dynamic IP I occastionally just get them
tvoie: wrote some software to do it, markov chain
is that like what cleverbot does?
So ya thought ya might like to come to the show.

Tell me, is something eluding you, sunshine? Is this not what you expected to see?
Wrek: I can imagine that, and I think I like.
tvoie: cleverbot is straight up repatition, this is more complicated but sounds dumber
huh... let me google this. a markov chain?
ota
hmm
is otakon still here?
No.
awww
http://www.mediafire.com/?g40cb3422gb2dmc << i just uploaded him too
>3.4 MB
of just text?
yup, thats a markov chain of his talk in this chat plus 1024 sentences generated from it
Well, it's a .txt file.
"SENTENCE 4: interesting gameplay yet fluttershy you "
"SENTENCE 6: i suddenly"
aparently he started a sentence with combustiblelemons 6 times
i think that was someone's name
The LEMONS!
...Habit.
Burn your house down!
and sweetlittlecanary 13 times
My Little Dashie is a good read.
When life gives you lemons, don't make lemonade. Make life take the lemons back! GET MAD! I don't want your DAMN lemons! What am I supposed to do with these?!
some of it is a little broken, it treats ' as a space
Kammerjunk: Why did you put an emphasis on "damn" ?
so a markov chain takes everything you ever said. figgure out how likely you are to say the same thing again, and takes a shot in the phycological dark?
Kammerjunk: There's no emphasis on the "damn" in the actual quote.
xcanox: Because memory is magic.
allso he said "otakon171 is" once
And if I put the idea into my head that he put emphasis on it, I can't hear it otherwise anymore.

I don't want your damn lemons! I don't want your damn lemons! I don't want your damn lemons! I don't want your damn lemons!
wat
tvoie: nope, lists how often words ocour after other words and picks at random
Did I altar your mind yet?
more it's used more likley it is
xcanox: well i no longer desire lemons
:))
that's intresting, i would like to know more about this
He kinda does.
Not much, but it's better than capitalising the whole sentence.
search for "Node 6162, 6162" in that file to see his use of the word lemon
Maybe it's just the 'D', I 'unno.
tvoie: if you know c, i can give you the code
Science isn't about why, it's about why not. You ask: why is so much of our science dangerous? I say: why not marry safe science if you love it so much? In fact, why not invent a special safety door that won't hit you in the butt on the way out, because you are fired.
^ that's a misquote
This quote website FAILS.
the onlything i ever did in c was program a robot to run on a remote controll
Those of you helping us test the repulsion gel today, just follow the blue line on the floor. Those of you who volunteered to be injected with praying mantis DNA, I've got some good news and some bad news: bad news is we're postponing those tests indefinitely. Good news is we've got a much better test for you: fighting an army of mantis men. Pick up a rifle and follow the yellow line. You'll know when the test starts.
dem text walls
i have almost no coding experience of any kind
tvoie: I am disappoint.
"SENTENCE 769: this is that s one time warp zones become altered tbh" some of these are so funny
it's not my fault! that robot did fantastic!
exept it had a glass jaw...
to be fair this is the most dificult c project i've ever done and its 300 lines, i think
I'm back
Hey, listen up down there! That thing's called an elevator - not a bathroom.
348 lines actualy
This is a test chamber. Four walls, ceiling and a floor. Good enough for science. Not Aperture Science! Gentlemen, I give you panels! The planks of tomorrow!

hi Asmalya
Just ordered new Socks \o/
*happy pony*
/me is looking at the oscar nominations
did anyone play the peer review dlc?
suddenly RAWRity
Phase4: Wat? Is that all the posts I've ever done?
...That is not a panel. That's a crusher. We sell them too.
otakon17: betwene september 7 and some time before the episode
hey everypony
/me is wondering what the fuck the Academy was smoking to put "Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close" up for Best Picture
Yeah
"64293 Lines Parsed"
Thats all of them
I joined mid october
otakon, not otakon17
Y no stream
I know
Good morning everyone
StickySyrup: because Mods are asleep
Hi StickySyrup, TOY_PON3
only 1989 mentions of otakon17 though
no, wrek is observing
so this is a europe bronie session?
don't lure us into a false sense of security
Lol, thats nearly my birth year
Extremely Loud was obvious Oscar bait.
hey Phase4 and RAWRity
I'm also wondering why the fuck "The Help" is up for Best Picture
otakon17: allso at the bottom is 1024 sentences generated from the chain, statiscticaly its you saying them
hi TOY_PON3
Tovler: it was also shit, and has a Rotten score on RT.
Okay
otakon17: that file WILL crash notepad, use programers notepad or notepad++
Im gunna play some Minecraft, so il be AFK,
Notepad++ saved my life.
Later StickySyrup
Now, Princess Monoke at 10fps? False right?
oh, is that what the thing about me with turtles on the escalator was?
I have a problem with never closing tabs.
So now I can have all the tabs I want!
The Help wa sabout as well acted or scripted as a hallmark movie, with only moderately better production values. The hell.
lol il still be on chat.. just not responding. Ding if u wanna talk
otakon17: "SENTENCE 855: because it applies to each other on what" alot of the sentences are junk, like this one
RAWRity: That movie wasn't all that...
it was shit because it was pretentious. and they LOVE pretentious
Those are responses
allso not sure about the 10fps, sry
Oh well
I'm trying to prove Cats in Skype wrong
its time for my sleep. 01:49 here
night #bronystate
night Phase4
He's making his entire judgement on the trailer
Sweet dreams, Phase4.
allso, otakon17, i must ask why you said 'altonception' in this chat
Tovler: But it WASN'T pretentious. It was incredibly dull and only impressive in how unambitious it is, recylcing a dozen other plot points from other dramas. And it's clear most critics didn't take kindly to it. 44% on RT.
Why are you talking to cats over Skype?
Alton?
I had a rough night last night... :(
No idea tbh
Tree of Life was pretentious garbage, but i at least get that the Academy would like it.
otakon17: only said it once, ah well. sleep time for me
nigh
Really, I can't believe Ides Of March god snubbed.
Kammerjunk: Bc, LordC put me in a group with him
Oh.
lol night Phase4
*got
brb
So whats up Bronystate ? anything you can do I can do better!
Anything I can do you can do better.
I will eat u
You can do anything better than me.
Yes i can
also, what the hell did Jonah Hill do to earn Best Supporting in Moneyball? He just played super awkward fat guy for 100 minutes.
No idea
Hi ekips
hey all
Wasn't The Tree of Life good?
Whatever happened to Brendan Faiser?
Kammerjunk: depends what you mean by "good"
Fraiser
My mum asked me to download it for her.
otakon17: Mummy 3 tanked and he died on scrubs.
Lol
RAWRity: Well, was it enjoyable?
Yeah, that scrubs ep was good
Kammerjunk: it's...a mixed. It's a very well shot and acted film, but it's so up its ass pretentious that I keep wanting to fart in teh director's face.
I don't like Jim Carrey anyway.
I do
Avatar was once nominated for Best Picture =.=
Gods
lolWAT?
How?
Tovler: Seeing how it sold, I'm not surprised, really.
anyone hear derpy talk yet
The one with the Smurfs ?
Yeah
TRIXIE
Sorry.
Big alien smurfs
Tovler: I can see why it got the Nom, it made a shitload of money and the academy basically had to put it in.
Um
blarg
I don't get it. Why does every film with aliens depict them as having arms and legs?
It makes no sense.
Yeah, so people would watch the award show.
but some of the Best Picture noms are both mediocre, AND poor box office performers.
Was that one movie 21 or 23?
Pony movie is best picture! :D
lol great! Im lost undergroundm with no food, no tools and on hardcore mode!
Really, I'm just pissed that The Descendants got in over Ides of March
i saw derpy talked
anyone else live stream during that?
yep
I was
wow, apparently I stopped both watching and pirating movies this year.
lol the chat box exploded
Tovler: I can't stop.
yeah it did, Here is the video on youtube

i just watched it
The problem is that I want to watch most new films.
i was there
:/
I wasn't.
brushie brushie brushie
I make sure not to be in #bronystate when new episodes air.
the secret workings of SOPA , if they cant controll the internet , they're gonna drive us off with shitty movies
dude the god damn chat basically exploded
Kammerjunk: lol it was a day to remember
The Artist got a nom, like I figured it would. So did Hugo, no surprise there, and War Horse was ALWAYS going to be in there.
they named her derpy
^.^
finally
I approve ^
Do we have a new bot?
nice to see that they listen to brony's
I can still see the impression of where my jaw landed on the floor :P

Nope.
Mods are asleep, post humans.

Kammerjunk: I was on this chat.. there was 5000 people on at one point

Well, I kind of did that just today as a presentation, but my classmates already knew it.
;)
lol.. I sort of let all my frinds know last friday night
yes, and unfortunately i'm entering the workforce, so i really can't afford to start flaunting my brony-ness
We must let everyone know we are bronies :)
still they know! And they dont really..... remember because they were as drunk as me =/
My friends and the people I work with know Im a brony
/me looks around and sees that no one else is wearing togas.
lol mirror
Everyone knows Im a brony, even my ex-wife. Lmao.
xD
seriously?
TOY_PON3: once i get a/the job, sure, maybe
/me takes off toga.

Cy|Asleep: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yes, I've been married
I work as a waiter

Asmalya!!!
Cy|Asleep: Halloooooo schlafmütze :D
yeah... i'm looking for a job a little more... permanent
I used to work as a paperboy.
Sadly, that was before ponies.
derpy hoves r epic
I been mostly in customer service
Hello, Yeah I just woke up. :P
ITS ALIVE!
yeah it's just for now MirrorImage I'm still in high school I wanna be a editor or writer or even a court reporter
I used to be a paperboy....until I took a pony to the knee
Stream is up?
though if it comes down to me getting a part time job, i'm half tempted to get a job at Toys'R'Us just so i can go brony-spotting
Kammerjunk: You're saying that it's better to be a paper boy since there are ponies?
Dinky
:P
hey Dinky_Hooves
MirrorImage: Do eey
hi
Ictiv: I'm saying that I have a lot of spare paper and ink in my printer.
i used to be a dinky,then i took a derpy to the knee
Kammerjunk: Ah
oh god that meme is so overused now
ofna01: None of those jokes please
I see your having adventuring problems, I feel bad for you son. I dodged 99 arrows but my knee took 1
It's so overused, I dare you to remember a single one of the other Skyrim memes
i have 99 problems but a dashie aiint one
StickySyrup: I came up with that one
how about instead of arrow to the knee, we make it pony to the face
I do
Ictiv: Fus Ro Dah.
dinky
Cy: saw it on memebase
hoof to the face
Kammerjunk: That is not a meme. That is a prayer
:D
Aw, did someone steal your sweetroll?
Yeah, I know.
Someone stole your swee-
Aww.
I gotta 99 problems but a arrow ain't one
shot to the heart
:3
I'm the one who started that line.
I had 99 cookies but the bitch ate 1
Rarity: I used to be chasing a dear friend, but then I took a- OH GOD PINKIE WHAT WAS THAT FOR?!
Lol
A SHOT THROUGH THE HAAART,AND YOUR TO BLAME
and you're so vain.... you give love.... a bad name
yay Bon Jovi
hell yes
what is love??? baby dont hurt me... dont hurt me
Alright
almost as good as ponies
I actually like the Atreyu version better.
I'll be back
You know, it's actually kind of neat living in a stable.
ofna01: But don't forget, nothing is better than ponies.
I'm a cowboy... on steel hooves I ride... Wanted. WANTED! dead or alive
Gonna get on my computer in a bit
OOOOOOO we're half way there! Oooo we're living on a prayer!
dont stand on it... u might break it
Kammerjunk: before or after the chlorine talisman is activated?
otakon17: But you're already on a computer.
/me has to go to work soon...
._.
No
awww
Yes.
17 is my mobile
B|
/me is listening to flutterwonder
Hm... Why did "Ghost Riders in the Sky" come to my mind all of a sudden?
there it goes
I think you need to take a look at what defines "computer"
I blame you Dinky_Hooves
live stream might be coming up
i got re-routed to nips
StickySyrup: I'll trade you flutterwonder for sunshine and calary stocks :)
mips*
I'll see all of you when I get to work. Talk you guys then. See you soon Everypony! :3
take care Cy
cya cy
lol=)
The word "computer" can actually be dated back to 1613, where it meant a person who did calculations.
Byebye
:D
have a pony-tastic day
Have fun, Cy.
There you go.
Cya Cy
I'll be back in like 30 minutes or so, XD
k
peace out brony
/me can get on Bronystate at work. ;3
"Computer" originates from the Latin word "computare", which means to calculate.
Cya Cy... *puts on sunglasses* YEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAA.... (Got it?... Got it?)
Bye :3
I wish I could >.>
a computer is one who computes
byee
With that definition, computers existed back in 2500 BC, in the form of the abacus.
alright kammer
your not a dictionary
That was all from memory, actually.
http://www.mips.tv/channel.php?u=89712
i got re-routed to there
Aside from the original definition.
???
It seems Ictiv...*puts on sunglasses* made a funny YEEEEAAAAAAAAA!!!!
:)
Kammerjunk: I would have been disapointed if you needed to look that up
pwnies
yaaa
pony's or pwnies
same thing
bronies, brownies what's the difference?
:P
Are you seriously asking that question?
xcanox why yes I am
:)
/me is now listening to Neverending Strife
Question though: Anyone understood when i said "Scripsi, edi, celebrasi"?
lol just kidding
hey sticky
gimme a link to giggle at the ghosties
im too lazy to make ew tab
I can only make guesses, Ictiv.
Kammerjunk: But good ones!
ok
we need someone to start the latest episode
must

I saw a very strange picture the other day
thx sticky
of what?
And since it seems that no one speaks the glorious, imperial language of Latin here, let me translate my previous statement: "I wrote, I published, I (came here and) celebrated!"
Well, "edo edi essum" means "to eat, consume, devour, waste".
it had seapony lyra swordfightighting OctoTavi
:O
Kammerjunk: edi also means to put forward of publish
sounds epic
RD and FS were so cute as filly's ;_;
love this song
giggle at the ghostie
NAO
"Celebrasi" I would guess being to celebrate, since a lot of English words are like that.
Dinky_Hooves: Dit it incolve Human Vinyl Scratch and Bon Bon?

When I was a little filly and the sun was going dooooowwnn
>.>
:D
syrup thats a great song
"Scripsi" would probably have given "script" in English, so I would guess that it's to write or note.
cup of flour
sorry everypont for mentioning cupcakes
Dinky_Hooves: They were finghting at "waist level"?
and a tea spoon of vanilla
yeah sticky thats.....erm..
glad i never read it
would it be okay if I posted link?
i heard some people threw up when they read it XD
ofna01 never read it
good
/me is now listening to Party with Pinkie by Alex s
toy_pon3 god
seriously it's baaad

What do you guys think about a picture
Bah
Long live the chat?
This is your good bye speech?
wat
/me opens big book and looks at it.
Dearly beloved.
I really want to post the link. I'm pretty sure its not r34 or explicit
Dinky_Hooves: here's the basic criteria - if you think it's borderline, it's probably illegal
We gathered here today, on this fine afternoon of our lord - Celestia - to mourn the passing of one very close to us.
Celestia is a girl, though.
Chat, was always kind and friendly to new people.
Its not borderline, just very weird
LordCelestia is not, though.
It offered listening ears and a shoulder to cry on.
cupcakes weird or Pinkie Pie Gypsie weird?
I can draw ponies by hand well... just not on the compuetr
computer
what happened to them?
wooo
Indeed Chat spent its life to make ours bettter and this is just makes its passing all the more sad.
Pinkie Pie Gypise is not weird, she's awesome. And kind of tragic at the same time.
VERY WEIRD: ENTER at own RISK! http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/453d6020d9f2d1a5fcf00e0ab4ecc359/117920%20-%20artist%3Ajohn_joseco%20dj_p0n3%20humanized%20I%27ve_seen_enough_JJ_to_know_where_this_is_going%20Lyra%20ninja%20Octapus%20Octavia%20Octo-Octavia%20panties%20pirate%20seapony%20swordfight%20underwear%20vinyl_scratch%20what.jpg

Ha ha, that picture.

one second, my brain needs to reboot
Octovia is best pony.

Then again...
/me rubs chin.
I AM awesome. Maybe that is an unfair advantage.
/me clicks on link. Blinks twice, then shoots himself.
Randomnerd: then zombifies and writes descritions, before cutting off own head.*
I nominate that pic for weirdest pony picture in history
