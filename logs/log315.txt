World History doesn't cover enough of Asia or Africa, but I imagine Europe pulls the same stupidity.

Whats up everyone?
trying again...
Given that European "World History" is basically a catalog of nasty things they did to people living on other continents.
The closest thing to foreighn history is when the Nazi's show up, and the way they drag things out make it seem that they've been fighting for about a decade
HAHAHAHA!

We learn of nothing about Canada's history in the american education system

yeah, adventure time doesnt look like the kinda thing i'm going to enjoy
<3 Viva La Vida~
adventure time is a bit avant garde I must admit. *stupid elitist word*
Okay that was my 3 minutes ta ta everybody~
toodle oo
lol
.....
....
ur doing it wrong...
especually the 3rd Season of Adventure Time. It's all over the place.
'Avant-garde (French pronunciation: [avɑ̃ɡaʁd]) means "advance guard" or "vanguard"' dafaq?
i fail to see how that apply's to adventure time
vanguard?
like in Phantasy Star?
"Avant-garde (French pronunciation: [avɑ̃ɡaʁd]) means "advance guard" or "vanguard"" should have read the rest of the sentence XD
whoops
ur doing it right XD
yeah. the first 2 seasons are appealing enough to everybody and generally make you feel good.
Half the episodes in season 3 leave me vexed. Yeah, vexed is a good word.
Lol @ the avant garde discussion
lol personally I've never seen a single episode of aventure time

"brown eyed girl"? how'd that get in my music collection
the 'console' is a text mode interface, like 'dos'
dos and unix shells are alot different, the latter for example can do multitasking
makes sense i guess
really?
you choose wich one you want at boot
i'm taking a tour of it now!
yup
i've network booted it on machiens without hard drives
the install cd is actualy a fully featured install

/me wonders if he's secretly a #brony
probably
never heard of that
Would you want to dream about ponies?
I'd never want to dream about ponies cuz waking up would be too disappointing.
i'ma code for a bit more then sleep

Oh well
I'm trying to prove Cats in Skype wrong

It makes no sense.

I approve ^
nice to see that they listen to brony's
I can still see the impression of where my jaw landed on the floor :P
For that matter, I also make sure not to be in #bronystate on BMN.
Other rooms do just fine.
XD cypress
Why not?
yeah
brony's ftw
This IS #bronystate
I say not mention that OTHER channel
this is where i watch at
Good for you
oh
Or, well, I watch it when it airs live.
But not in this particular room on IRC.
anyone else usein Safari?
its bein weird
yeah
I use ff
let us know when u change it
Oh, you can just us-
Oh.
Okay, then.
The noms for Best Animated Feature are also pretty lackluster.
i r back
yeah?
Americans should be waking soon

k
"Computer" originates from the Latin word "computare", which means to calculate.
Bye :3
I wish I could >.>
byee
With that definition, computers existed back in 2500 BC, in the form of the abacus.
alright kammer
That was all from memory, actually.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tiynTPuUUM
I saw a very strange picture the other day
thx sticky
And since it seems that no one speaks the glorious, imperial language of Latin here, let me translate my previous statement: "I wrote, I published, I (came here and) celebrated!"
Well, "edo edi essum" means "to eat, consume, devour, waste".
:O
giggle at the ghostie
NAO
"Celebrasi" I would guess being to celebrate, since a lot of English words are like that.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOVDu7etQlc&feature=related
It doesn't contain nudity or anything, but I'm worried you guys might hate me if I posted a link

We gathered here today, on this fine afternoon of our lord - Celestia - to mourn the passing of one very close to us.
Celestia is a girl, though.
Its not borderline, just very weird
It offered listening ears and a shoulder to cry on.
I can draw ponies by hand well... just not on the compuetr
computer
