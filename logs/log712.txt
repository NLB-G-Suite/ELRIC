War Z? you mean Day Z?
brb
Hey anyone play wave 666 for TF2 yet?
11,02So, apparently, G4 is going to suck now.
lol
why?
00,10and then you all thought he ment ponies
11,02Because they are moving away from their gaming-theme programming
XD
silly ponies
G4 has sucked for a while
XD
for about 5 seconds i thought hi did lol
11,02:P
04G4's been bad for a while
13apparently there's no reward for finishing wave 666
Oh :D
13so dumb
find*
04Once Sessler left it went baaaaad, worse than it was
the reward is knowing you survived
04It was great when Tech TV was on its own
04Morgan used to be normal
13how could you possibly have fun with one of those oversized hair dryers?
04Until mainstream pop culture kinda flanderized her
goddamn i forgot it makes that face
shyguy4214, I hate it when you hog all the pizza.
Cops and cheaters is still on that station?
04Yeah, G4 went terrible when Cops and Cheaters were circulated into regular programming
Yesh
11,02O.O
cops and cheaters are probably what's been keeping it afloat for a while
00,10So I should stream g4 then?
13for MEN
that's Spike's job
http://browse.deviantart.com/?q=zombie+pony&offset=216#/d4x99xt

04Yes
buenos dias everyone
04Night Derpy
00,10ewwwwww, g4 has the ironman anime
like the burger eating contest
and the rascal ramps
04Eh, I stopped watching G4 when all it showed for hours and hours at a time were Cops
suddenly livestream
04That was last year, I think
04Cops, Cheaters, whatever other dumb non-tech shows that were up there in programming..yeah
04AOTS and X-Play were the only beacons of light for the channel
04But then Munn left
g4 the necxt mtv
04Super is my mortal enemy
and worse

04Whoda thunk it?
00,10big breasted pirates
04I don't think Screen Savers would be that desperate
04At least not for attention
04They seemed really content with their niche show and viewership
00,10I liked screan savers.
13we get it, code of hero was a touching ep, THERE WERE TWELVE OTHERS THAT SEASON
00,10they actualy were helpfull
04Screen Savers ruled
All da color
04Remember when it was Extended Play?
04Good times

04Then there was Judgment Day, yeah

/me shrugs
/me nods
A demonchild
I wouldn't want to play with strangers. :<
See, I had my reasons to bash you.
:>
I'm not social enough for that.
It's most of the reason I don't regularly play TF2
I don't like playing if I don't know anybody
ikr?
I haven't bashed Dema though.

MOAR CRATES.
NEVER TOO MANY.
Can always have more crates
build a ladder to the moon
snort Armstrong's footprint

Hehe
I draw frickin' Gargoyles crossovers. I draw charaters as gargoyles that have no business being gargoyles. o_o

And write fanfics about them
Aah, the fun of creativity
Sanity is playing punk music and living in sheds in the woods going "The system sucks, man"
Well, I used to write fanfics about them. My muse seems to have abandoned me, and I haven't been able to write anything since. >.>
<.<
Aw, writing is fun- but yeah, it comes and goes

i never really understood tf .....
2010*
I think it turned free in 2010 yeah
I played BF3 when it came out-

It's not impossible
how many kills he get?
but there's no real difference between how hard it is to learn
i just prefer controllers,i dont fit in here <_<
haha
It's okay, noone minds
I don't ship Fluttershy and Dash, but--it's a great friendshipping episode between them at least
"friendshipping"- ayup!
Yeah, I'm not into shipping but the one shippping I find okay is friendshipping.
I think my--current Fluttershy ship is eh...probably Flutterlight
