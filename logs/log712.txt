Hello Lunacorn! Did you watch other episodes?
my sanity is almost empty
Man I love Darkwing DUck
I grew UP on this
dexter and mandark, its like dexters lab in duck form
Disney Afternoon, God I miss that
The nostalgia I wish I had here...
MadSurge: finished first season
So did I.
Tale Spin
I loved Tale Spin
This is episode one right?
Lunacorn: any favorite ponies? :3
lol
and THAT is what's his name
Eeyup DerpyMuffins!
Jim Cummings
Dat logic
MadSurge: besides luna? ehh.... honestly.. twilight
the man who is as well traveled in VA'ing as Mel Blanc
Oh man, Duck Tales, Gummi Bears, Chip N' Dale, TaleSpin, this...
kill in a DISNEY CARTOON
^
They changed it up a bit though since then
Lunacorn: wait until you meet our mod Wrek :D
Back when Disney didnt give a flying feather
otakon: and dead relatives
eeyup
guns in a diseny cartoon......
but at my house i dont have hub so im screwed until i go to Erin's house
That scream has been used 3 times now.
^ otakon.. BAMBI

I liked the evil DarkWing duck episode
Is that scream a stock scream?
Mutterguy: well this is specifically a KID'S CARTOON
BAMBEH! OH NOES!
He has a cow
AlienWarhead: yup
Cow woman :D
otakon man
and yeah Taurus Bullba is probably Darkwing's most dangerous enemy
TO BE CONTINUED....RIGHT NOW
so yeah.. no hub for me :<
Alright Simba's dad in the lion's King?
AlienWarhead: no he's a Bull, I was talking about the pilot.
otakon: Yet we only see him twice
J_E_Smith71: yeah but he's that dangerous each time
yay, its smooth playback now :3
Was the first ever ep?
otakon: more genre savvy than the others? :D
SafariMonkey: Yes
MadSurge: I've watched a LOT of these
and that theme song
:)
otakon I thought you were quoting "Don't have a cow man"
AlienWarhead: oh no :D
otakon: This version of the theme, or the older one?
OK I'll watch from the start
otakon: I watched Ducktales, but not DW :(
J_E_Smith71: this version is the one I know or at least remember
Dat 4th wall!
this was back when Disney was good :P
MadSurge: they did a crossover with Gizmo Duck a lot too and Darkwing was very jealous of GD bc he was more famous
Keen Gear
Egg Shotgun
otakon: the weird robot guy? :D
otakon: When the series showed up on Disney Channel before on Disney Afternoon the theme had a different singer and music
MadSurge: yeah
THE MILK.
J_E_Smith71: maybe you're right
The milk!
he's okay
damn i wish i grew up in the 90s :<

Oh, it's free?
it signs you in automatically, so there's really no need to remember it
Yep.
Polydunami: it does have premium though
But I thought some calls cost money
Lunacorn|Angry: y r u angry
what are y'all talking about being free?
Well, you have to pay for group video calls. But normal voice group calls are free.
oh
Lunar_Brony: sorry bout that
I mean, it's only a few cents but still
therainbowvortex: its complecated
You should write it down somewhere
yeah
Lunacorn|Angry: WILL A HUG HELP
But the trouble for me is actually being able to pay the right way for that.
therainbowvortex: yes
Lunar_Brony: is that it or is their more
/me hugs Lunacorn|Angry
Lunacorn|Angry: well sorry that your angry, hope you feel better :)
Polydunami You only pay for group video calls.
superrretroworld: thx :)
Normal calls are free, that goes for group calls as well.
/me hugs Lunacorn|Angry again
And barely, DashWithRainbows
I need to stop daydreaming so much
aww now erin is calling me on mah phone brb
therainbowvortex not much more to say on the matter. Basically, I just crashed into laughter and thought my life was over. Nobody in my family mentioned it until my jackass friend told them after I invited him over for dinner.
Wait, DashWithRainbows, normal video calls are free?
One of these days ill get a ps3
Polydunami: yeah with one person/pony
DerpyMuffins: if only her hair was blonde then she would definitly look like a human form
regular Skype calls are free
Polydunami: but multi cost money
I see
one-on-one chat is free
Polydunami Video calls with one person are free.
Lunar_Brony: did your family judge you
erin is telling me not to be angry cause he is making muffins for me
Right, I understand
nice
such a good friend
Not sure when :P
He sure is. :)

Hey there, Ninjazz
Jokes on them though. hey like the show too

therainbowvortex they just asked if anyone at school was a brony too and if I ever got picked on about it at school, normal stuff from my parents. I'd rather not go into further detail..

hi Ninjazz
Lets not leave Derpy out of the fun http://derpy.me/GnyBo
Oho!
But it's average. therainbowvortex, yeah, he's new.
[Alpha] your parents actually gave it a shot?

And that includes my younger sister.
My two little brothers watch it and my littles siter too

Domo: don't worry about it

Oh, strange
Wait, wut. Who is this Domo and his +?
I didnt set that automatically under normal conditions
Lunacorn|Angry: so how did u become one of us
Domo Correction; You can't draw wings to save your life /yet/
Lunar_Brony: my friend erin (brony2447) made me watch one and i liked it then he showed me this site and here i am
Domo: try drawing a hand then add more 'fingers" and make them longer than thinner with larger ends
You'll get there soon :3

Lunacorn|Angry: stay the hell away from the cupcakes fanfic it just dont go there
Nononononononono no no thank you.
...
Oh, I had thought this was Wrek trying something new. But it's not Wrek
therainbowvortex: oh too late..ask Ninjazz what i mean..
One guy at my school brought myself and 3 other people into the herd
Yeah
Ninjazz Too bad, you'll get it when you least expect it.
Why?
Ohai
Dari, for Pete's sake, go to bed!
I guess its time I change it

Ninjazz: did Lunacorn|Angry allredy read cupcakes
But I don't even like Pete. ;___;

He's a prince. He does what he wants

I don't think I had made it to The Master yet this time last year.
Handsome Jack's real name is John

Ninjazz Oh no! I'll just have to stay far away and shoot you with my revolver, or watch you starve.

I thought it was larger
Either way
I was just dramatically overexagerating, Lunacorn|Angry.

Tihs song sounds familier...
Ruby:oh okay then

Nacht SafariMonkey.

twilight_sprinkle: I wasn't sure what to call it
It's not linked to spyrochat.com at all
14Okay skipped it. Now this song I like. XD
Never thought Luna looked this purple
Maybe Twilight
Pewdiepie:I GAVE YOU A BOX......AND THIS IS HAH YOU TREAT MEH
twilight_sprinkle, is it KP-Shadowsquirell's Rarity with Braces picture?

SafariMonkey: fair enough, just sayin in case though, you shouldnt really believe them
You'll just have to identify in the future when you log in
Like this: /ns id password
Ninjazz: lol that should be a funny pic :D
14'Indestructible' by Disturbed ^3^
derpy advice #53 saying random stuff iis just practiceing not being shy
twilight_sprinkle: I know, some of the stuff they said was like "What?"
ah nice
therainbowvortex: you are a good friend :)
twilight_sprinkle: but I agreed with some of the peta stuff.
twilight_sprinkle, Lol. What's the suprise?
brb
Actually in that command I gave you before, instead of where it says nick change it to whatever password you want to use
SafariMonkey: they also provide almost no facts, and the ones they do, they completely twist it
Lunacorn|Angry: yer? thank you
And make sure you're currently using whatever name you want registered
SafariMonkey: i agreed with some of the things they said, but with none of their ways of proving it
therainbowvortex: no, thank you
lol erin is calling me again
twilight_sprinkle: As I said, a lot of it I disagreed with. That was why I listed it as comedy/documentary, rather than the other way around
k
SafariMonkey: yeah :P
Lunacorn|Angry: so what do you think of bronystate ?
uno secunda Ninjazz
14Bah. This drawing sucks. >_>
Take your time, senor twilight_sprinkle.
therainbowvortex: amazing people... amazing vids.. amazing movies... its amazing
Curse your fancy letters, Spanish language.
And I agreed with quite a bit of the idea, but as you say, it was just anecdotal evidence most of it.
btw i wub all of you bronystate!
We love you too, Lunacorn|Angry. :)
Might I ask why Luna is so purple?
Lunacorn|Angry: You don't seem as angry now. :)
Lunacorn|Angry: yer the people are great theirs a lot at times
k I got it
I'm worried most about the artist's internet connection
My bet is he/she has ADSL not SDSL
thank you all bronystate for cheering me up
Yeah, I'm getting occasional buffer. But I don't mind, considering that this is one of her first stream attempts. :)
and not a great one at that

yay, japanese learning
Brb
PeachStreak|drawing: A bro? You mean, in real life brother?
twilight_sprinkle, I was using chrome before firefox.
Ninjazz: y u stop?
FireFox has alot of customizable stuff.
i consider Erin my brother he is just so awesome
Because chrome was slowing down as hell.
becuase his bucking mother said we cant hangout anymore becuase of the little punks thinking they are all tough and shit and causing all chaos
and no just a close friend
was a close friend
But now I'm trying to relearn how I got everything how I wanted it to, twilight_sprinkle.
Oh......well that sucks.
not dead just
Ninjazz: yeah if youre referring to the annoying bug of being slow as hell after you turned it on after cimputer in sleep mode, they fixed that
cant hangout
because of thos little shits
PeachStreak|drawing: So it was because of his friends that you two can't hang out?
yay i found another place with the pic http://www.omega-level.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Everything-Was-Nicolas-Cage.-e1323879371731.jpg
twilight_sprinkle, I've already got the damn thing installed and a lot of apps on. :/
AJIsAwesome: no
08,01wheeeee!
AJIsAwesome: the little assholes decide to buck with us and remember when I said I got jumped when I got off the bus it was those insenstive little pricks
WHAT?!
It was them?
08,01AJIsAwesome: i said, "wheeeeeee"
AJIsAwesome: the funny thing is that they are younger than I
Guys, when you make mistakes...Opacity lock is your friend.
PeachStreak|drawing: Have you tried explaining this to your mother or your friend's mother?
So Domo, what do the layers do in the art program?
AJIsAwesome: yeah his mother is thick minded my mom frankly doesnt give a damn
AJIsAwesome: layers save your butt, thats what they do
PeachStreak|drawing: Oh my, well that sucks. :(
AJIsAwesome: How to explain..--well yeah that LOL
atr is good,but im heading out
good night all

and night!
Bye shadowboy8456 :)

PeachStreak|drawing: Darn. Well, I hope things work out for you. :(
ya
wow I have no idea what's going on with my code right now >_>
?
sorry I usually don't swear but ya
Programming
PeachStreak|drawing: reminds me of my high school, there were pricks, who were actually younger than me too, but they kept picking on one of my classmates
It's inserting a database entry where it should be modifying
Not sure why
getting kinda frustrated though
PeachStreak|drawing: they even had a fight once, and wouldnt you know it, the prick was going to use a chain as brass knuckles
twilight_sprinkle: ya but now I cant hang out with my best friend because of them his mother cant get it threw her thick skill
PeachStreak|drawing: but someone saw it, took it off, and then my classmate beat him up
twilight_sprinkle: that is just disturbing
One of my closest friends in my entire life was about 3 younger than me, so I was picked on a lot during my high school years.
oh, sorry cant help you there :/
*3 years
PeachStreak|drawing: dont remember if they layed off him after that, dont think entirely, but maybe somewhat
yeah that's okay :P just sharing my frustration
also one of 'em came up to me and my 2 friends with a wooden baseball bat
twilight_sprinkle: Your classmate beat who up? The "prick", right?
PeachStreak|drawing: you should tell someone if theyre threatening you though, even the police maybe
AJIsAwesome: yeah
Ah.
AJIsAwesome: wasnt his idea, he didnt have much of a choice, he didnt want to
I did well my friends mother told them so I think they are under house arrest
AJIsAwesome: funny thing is, it was actually considered to be a good school
Oh my.
my best friend got jumped last week
Linn Mar Highschool SUX
AJIsAwesome: and thats why i hated my high school, it was only god at looking good, but truth was it sucked
For some reason my internet is slow guys x_x sorry....and oh dear o~o

Lunacorn|Joyful: Did he get hurt?
WHAT?!
Lunacorn|Joyful: feel sorry for ya

Lunacorn|Joyful: How injured is he? :O

AJIsAwesome: they cut up some of his arm and gave him a black eye
Domo: It's okay.

Domo: remember to give Sumica's that slight goth look :P
x3
do users post to it?
04Mummy ninja
04That's my human OC
Yeah
Ill test it.
It's just one guy right now though
Ghosties: so you're Mack the Knife from Captain Commando?
seems legit
oh i mean, the general public
YOur Oc is Ninja David Bowie?
can the general public post or make comments
04Wow, it's weird that you mentioned Mack the Knife since I'm listening to Bessie Jones
yo has anypony seen brony2447 on?
badass
THE JEAN THAT IS VAL!
looks too happy
Lunacorn|Joyful: Nope
Lunacorn|Joyful: yeah like 5 hours ago
Domo: Would you like some music requests? :)
Val the Kacki Shorts
Only if I manually change their user level in the database
Domo: your logs are WAY behind, scroll down
cachi01: really? he always seems to be off when im on and vice versa
Never has there been so many human OC's on one screen.
"Gotts Make Them All Evil"
wait
haven't quite gotten around to implementing that yet since there's only like 1 user
ah ok
04Though, it'd be even MORE ironic if I were listening to Ella Fitzgerald, ota
XD
otakon: the stream itself is way behind
00,02DuskStarshimmer, Ping
otakon: wait wu--yeah
well lets have a look :)
SpeccyRush: yeah but by 2 hours?
Domo: where do you live? I think that is the issue here. I saw your timestamps at 23 where mine are 1
how it works right now is anyone can register but you have to be given permission to post stuff to it
so "approved" users
yeah
pigns please
well otakon how long ago did poly leave?
DuskStarshimmer like this?
SpeccyRush: not that long, like 10 minutes maybe
110 mins?
10
*
111
nah less
Domo: post the time stamp you see when you get this message please?
Did chat die?
Who did it?
I'm the one who killed them all!
I survied after the fall!
:3
Whoa what was that
I'll PM you the link, and don't laugh at my fixed dimension design either, I had to change it quickly to fit on a phone screen <_<

What WAS that?
otakon: k then stream is between 10 and 20 mins behind
And the chat just exploded

Haku zoned out for a second, whats everyone talking about now?
My client just loaded a whole bunch of messages for some reason. :S

Austin: I couldn't think of anything else for a cutie mark :/
Ponies47: nothing? do you like sports or anything?
Okay I know the episode was made in 2006, but Cartman should have went for a Wii U

J_E_Smith71: lol maybe a future ep? :D
Austin: Like I said. I couldn't think of anything nor do I have any talent :/

AMURIKA, AMURIKA, GOD FRIES MY FOOD FOR MEEEE

Ghosties: yah thay removed all videogames and tehc stuf

Ponies47: dats da speirt
04Oh man, Screen Savers

04Love those guys
04They had TMBG on their show once <3

Oh mai

Jaimu
I once stayed up for 36 hours straight >:3
ah yes, Mother 5: The Nesspire Strikes Back

Hey Jmo
04Whoda thunk it?
00,10why not both Ghosties
00,10big breasted pirates
04I don't think Screen Savers would be that desperate
04At least not for attention
04They seemed really content with their niche show and viewership
Sumica yeah! Big boobied Pirates...in...*Roy Mustang voice* TINY MINI SKIRTS :D
13i started writing off G4 in like 2007 when they kept replaying the same episode of beast wars every single day... never moved on to the rest of the season
00,10I liked screan savers.
13we get it, code of hero was a touching ep, THERE WERE TWELVE OTHERS THAT SEASON
00,10they actualy were helpfull
04Screen Savers ruled
04I remember Morgan used to be on the show too
All da color
13xplay started sliding, attack of the show started strong then crashed
04Remember when it was Extended Play?
04Good times
13there was one it was tommy tallarico and.. i forget the other guy
04And it was just Sessler by himself, I think
13judgment day or something

04Then there was Judgment Day, yeah
04Adam is cool ;_;
04Oh

Hello Vivix
Hiya Adam
Hiyo Vivix
And hello Demona
What's up in here?
I'm about to go to the kitchen and forage me some breakfast
Just some TF2 and insanity
The breakfast hunt is the best foodhunt of the day- for some reason
Well, in my opinion
Breakfast steak, the most important steak of the day
hehe
I had brie and crackers for breakfast
And feed my cats, who are telling me they're "starving". :P
/me slaps Vivix
/me swallows Jmo's arm
O.o
Hehe, cats really know how to starve
How does that even work
You hit me so hard it just--vanished?
o.O
;__;
I'd question your logic, if you had one.
Hehe, yeah-
and yeah it's snowing a lot here now adays
and one of our cats loves it, the other HATES it
so letting them out in the morning is crazy
hello every-:o TF@!

DEATH TO VIVIX.
WAT!?
:3
DEATH TO EVERYTHING NOT CUTE
I'll schtick my goaticorns on you! So just you beware!
:3
Oh dear god
;__;
Death to the goaticorns.
!
I'll shtick thee ALICORNS on you!
How original >.>
<.< they're..horns
dammit spy
get off him!
Fun fact: Alicorn = the horn on a narwhale, and so the horn on Pegacorn's are named Alicorn, and same with unicorns
Vivix
Go play with your goaticorns.
;__; k
/me thinks goaticorns are cute...
Oh
No
Please no.
/me is not alone, yay
/me also thinks alicorns are cute. :P
Jmo haas to agree on that one
/me thinks narwhals are awesome.
Nope
Imagine a majestic Derpy with a horn
Nope
/me hits
NOP
DERPY HAS WINGS, NOTHING ELSE.
Narhwales are cool, beacuse- they look so otherworldy
!
/me thinks Jmo is awesome. <--(try disagreeing with that one)
Imagine it!
I disagree.
:>
Jmo is uncool!?
/me tries disagreeing..head explodes
/me sits at the cool kid's table
Oh well.
Doesn't bother me :3
/me throws Vivix away from the table
my table
Ah damnit...foiled again
/me tries to sit at the cool kids table... Is repelled by nerdiness
Haah.
Declind
Declined*
I'm too nerdy for the cool kids table. :<
We'll make a cool nerds table
Yay!~ 8D
More snoipers
/me sits at the cool nerds table. :>
i lolled xD
the cool nerds table, with a built in slot for the dungeon master's rulebooks and folders. Or maybe that's just the nerd table
That's the DnD table.
/me never played tabletop RPGs, sadly...
/me eats outside, simpler that way
I wanna get into Wh40k TT but tis expensive.
I've only done it a few times- it's surprisingly fun
getting into DnD costs a sheet of paper and a good DM
Hitting Vivix costs nothing.
:>
yes it does! It costs friendship credit
I'd like to play one, cuz they seem like so much fun
We never had a friendship to begin with. D:
;,
;__;
so betrayed
:<
Bwahahaha
but yeah, I wish I knew people who played it, only played it a few times with my cousins big brother and his dnd friends when I was a kid
You were a child once?
I know eh some anime shops and other nerd shops around here have DnD clubs, but- way too shy
I thought you were a demon spawn.
/me shrugs
/me nods
A demonchild
I wouldn't want to play with strangers. :<
See, I had my reasons to bash you.
:>
I'm not social enough for that.
Yeah- I think it's best with friends, since it's sooo social, you know- acting and stuff
It's most of the reason I don't regularly play TF2
I don't like playing if I don't know anybody
Jmo: You bash pretty much everything :<
ikr?
Ah yeah- I'm kinda the same there, I prefer to play with someone I know

MOAR CRATES.
NEVER TOO MANY.
Can always have more crates
build a ladder to the moon
snort Armstrong's footprint

That's probably gonna happen when moon becomes more accessible in a few hundred years
Only you'd think of something like that.
;_;
You crazy norweigian.
I need a themesong
lol snort Armstrong's footprint
"O DAT VIVIX"

You don't Vivix.
You shall remain your plain self.

or Adam will shank you with a rusty knife.
>.>
! That damn killer duck
ikr
killer carnivorous duck
Horse ducks.
O_o
I now imagine him like that redeyed duck from Courage
The horror.
I once drew a birdcow-
lolwut^
a cow iwth a beak
ah yes, Sanic Generators
The stuff you draw.
Your sanity fell out of bed one morning.
Ermahgerd! Sernerc Gernererters!
I just like hybrids ;__;
YOU LIKE WEIRD THINGS >.>
Hehe
Jmo: What about me, Jmo? Based on the stuff I draw, what happened to my sanity?
It's in the corner rocking back and forth telling itself it'll return someday.
I draw frickin' Gargoyles crossovers. I draw charaters as gargoyles that have no business being gargoyles. o_o
:>
And write fanfics about them
Aah, the fun of creativity
Sanity is playing punk music and living in sheds in the woods going "The system sucks, man"
Well, I used to write fanfics about them. My muse seems to have abandoned me, and I haven't been able to write anything since. >.>
<.<
Aw, writing is fun- but yeah, it comes and goes
Too bad you can't write Vivix.
:3
The only creativity I reguralee re..regu
I'm proving your point Jmo!
reeguurarererily do
is music
Regularly? :D
yes!
English newb.

Phase4: Of course I like Gargoyles. That's where I got my name. :D
The Demona part anyway. XD
She stole the Gold from a Leprechaun.
lol Jmo
That's my story, I'm sticking with it. :>
the Holloween event this year is AWESOME
/me loves Plants Vs. Zombies
It's true.
I found an unusual
oh right, it's the halloween thing
Phase4, offer?
most of it
internet is derping D:
AdamTheDuck, no idea
K
And NOW the sun decides to rise here... Lazy bum. ¬_¬
Hey guys I'm making a couple of scout weapons for the steam workshop. who wants to see?
me
K I'ma get the link
XylemTube, me :3
http://gamebanana.com/wips/41226
http://gamebanana.com/wips/41227
thisu is what i have so far
Cool =D
Interesting
whats everyone's fav scoot wep?
That derringer pistol thingy :3
Soda Popper.
What's it called?
hmmm
Short stop, that's it
Mine is the soda popper
same here, soda popper is teh way to go for me
Haven't played scout enough to have a favorite weapon. :P
but the default strange scattergun is suprerior
When you make a workshop weapon, are you allowed to fiddle with the code?
soda popper+flying guilotuine+sandman=my loadout and it owns on VSH
I think my loadout is standard everything- despite having had the game for years and years and years
average damage on hale in one life is 1200 dmg
unless he does a noob rage on me >.>
/me has no idea what any of that means
man I'm out of touch-
/me licks Vivix
/me sucks on Adam
that means he does a rage on Just you
Not sure who hale is- event?
its a custom mod
Vivix, it's a game mode
Ah
Looking at my stats-
one guy versus a whole team
Vivix, think one super player vs everyone else
Vivix: what do you mean by "the code"
5 hours on record- bought it when it came out-
you know, the code for the weapon. Or is it just model?
woooo finally made it through the island
Vivix, Phase usually plays Pony Heroes or something where one player gets a pony model and has to kill everyone else
since it's multiplayer and all, I mean
AdamTheDuck, ahh
I've seen that, but never knew what it was
Vivix: Well if you mean change the weapon's stats, then no. that's up to valve. What I'm making is a skin
SpeccyRush, planning to
ahh
also: Paused
1979177947330% of 932.0 MB
sometimes steam makes no sense
i'll give you a hat for it
but i'll give you a hat
Oh you collect the zombies?
Vivix: this model itself reqires coding, so you can mess with that
Buytoast, it's a misc item that turns you into a zombie
the*
a scoot that high pitched is simply too anoying when he says need a dispenser here
Ah yeah- yeah the qc things?
ages since I've doone anything with hl- so don't know how workshop works
>.>

MadSurge: LOL, thanks. :)

Ohai there Cypresswolf
/me dresses Jmo with a duck costume .-.
Park service sounds much more relaxing right about now :) beat digging holes
Quack.
/me takes out his rusty kitchen knife and beheads Jmo o.o
Demaaa ;__;

Adam is hurting meee
/me cooks Jmo
Hey everypony
Ohai Serenity

And suddenly, TF2
Ohai Serenity
D:
/me saves Jmo
But I just blood left!
/me steals Jmo back
Mah saviour.
/me saves Jmo again
Took a crash course on how to drive & operate the 3 pedal backhoe/excavator - I can drive it ok, but operating the shovel to scoop up dirt & dig...not so easy
/me slaps Gold_Demona around a bit with a large Jmo
o.o
seems that no one has keys for trade
anoying
/me steals Jmo back hides him in her cleavage
keys?
._________.
Phase4: What are you offering?
:D
Serenity, 2.33
its all i have
Like I have the breast size for proper cleavage. lol :D
im back, i just needed some fresh air
Yeah, normals are 2.66 :c and eerie keys are 5
ALL OF MY WAAAAAAAAAAAT.
Feeling better Snow?
Jmo, XD
Serenity, they were 2.33 at some point
Would you rather be cooked Jmo?
I JUST DON'T
NO.
BUT
Phase4: So what does "2.33" mean exactly (i never really traded and stuff)
Phase4: For some bizzare reason, demand went up
And the trencher we rented was delivered without a gaurd for the chain - if a safety inspector sees that, the rental company gets in trouble
i little
diddutz: I'll tell you
a little*
I'm listening :3
2 is 2 reclaimed, and .33/.66/1 are reclaimed
2 refined*
So 2.66 is 2 refined and 2 reclaimed
Phase4: Do ya want a reclaimed?
and scrap metad just doesnt count in at all?
.-.
diddutz: Scrap metal is .16
Serenity, free?
Phase4: If you can't afford to give me anything, yeah, free
I think it's 2 scrap = 1 rec
Serenity: okay thx
Isn't it 3 scrap?
I know it used to be 3 scrap, but not sure if it's 2 or 3
Wait, yeah, it's 3, so it's 1.1
Jmo: ill join
.-.
0.11*
Grr
wow, when did i get one of those
/me pats Snow
TF2 economy >.>
Snaggletooth!
I b traumatized.
yeah
tf2 economy
where they ask 12 keys for a strange sapper
Snow: Strange sapper is worth a few rec :P
Phase4: Tell me which server you're on in PM and I'll join and hand one over
Serenity: last ime i checked it was 12 +- keys
Ahh, must be thinking of red tape recorder
nope
Serenity, found a scrap
wonder if i shouldnt reduce the ones i have stranges of
i've been keeping around normals but tbh i never use
Phase4: Keep 1 of each decent weapon, and bin the rest
Phase4, well why would you use it if you have the strange? .-.
Serenity, 203.34.186.31
AdamTheDuck, exact;y
exactly'
oh wow, strange sapper is now 17-18 keys worth
O.o
TF2 economy <.<

i7 Tower CPU 6 core >:3
Only downside to my computer is 5600rpm hdd
Mine is something like OVER 9000
but I didn't really want an SSD- but 7600rpm would probably be better, even if the effective speed difference isn't that huge-
lol I played the James Bond theme with the character select. XD

Hehe yeah- this one I built from this summer to lst month

/me slaps Jmo with Jmo
I thought I was fully up to date-

How many you need phase?
aah, I was in college then- with a horribly failing p4 3.1ghz computer <,<
I had p4 until I built this computer
>.>
So, I hear weather is happening
and then someone responds, "Yes, much weather"
OH GOD THAT SPRAY
Hey look, another person
Vivix, I had a 5 year old celeron laptop at the time.

cowvarkian: yep
MadSurge: ah, ok
cowvarkian: TF2

I could join..
ill try to ask my friend

SafariMonkey, oooh yeah-video and art--that's like- you kinda want 32gb
Phase4
password
ponies
I do music, so 16gb was enough, since I don't do heavy multitrack live recordings
ip 198.71.92.231
password is ponies
Phase4: original
?
Vivix, it's OK for now, I'm frugal with it when I need it
Phase4: Im mocking the password
fair enough
I fell down a hole
TF2 crash dam..
Vivix: cool story alice
i cant play TF2 on this pc
sorry Phase D:
How many left do you need phase?
how do i direct connect?
Jmo, 4
aight
OK so I gotta go again
infernap, open the console, type password ponies; connect 198.71.92.231
to direct connect, open console and write password password, then connect ip
toodles SafariMonkey
Bye. :P

so we can get haunted metal
but i seriously cant do anything because TF2 is all fucked up on this pc
ah
Nearly finished updating, so I might join.

Even worst if it's DDR2
im joining in a sec

o.o
Ello there everybrony.
Hello, Malavolent. :)
hi
What is this TF halloween update all about?
buenos dias everyone :)
I think it's about the new comic that's been released. :)
Also, hi naturesfury! :)
But there's some new stuff in game too.
hello
There have been some new features added for only a short time, but that's all I know.
Also, hello artist. :)
it's a yearly event
it only lasts a few days-
Oh.
o hello artist
A few days?
LOl
how are things naturesfury
/me shrugs
Few weeks more like
so....TF2?
I haven't played TF2, so I wouldn't really know. :D
few weeks?
is tf2 free to play now?
I only play it once in a while
so--this is first time in a bot a year
yes it is
hmm
still would rather play bf3
its been free like 2012 i thought?
i never really understood tf .....
2 bad all bronies rather play tf2 :/
2010*
I think it turned free in 2010 yeah
I played BF3 when it came out-
but--didn't really like it
naturesfury: psssst....im a brony who like bf3.....psssst
I think I'd honestly have more fun playing TF2 than BF3.
not that I'm a big TF2 fan either, but- fun once in a while
whos the bad shot with the shotgun here?
lawl
/me get's distracted by irc, gets murdered
It's Phase.
omw
http://misteralex.net/misc/images/my_little_pwniez_rock_band_3_th.jpg :D no Pinkie or Twilight though :(
artist u play bf3 on pc?
and ill be unboxing that thingie there
naturesfury: no, i cant afford a good gaming pc, i have it on ps3
ahhh :'(
i dont really like pc controls either
feels wrong once you've held a controller
Opposite here artist
same
i cant do fps with controlers
Vivix: i've heard it's much harder getting good at playing games on pc, then with controllers
I've heard the opposite, but I don't play to get good
Vivix: a friend of mine, wich has an xbox, was invited to play with the best COD team
optic
It's not impossible
how many kills he get?
but there's no real difference between how hard it is to learn
there's a cap where APM and Accuracy is--less possible on a controller, but who cares?
i guess so
i just prefer controllers,i dont fit in here <_<
haha
It's okay, noone minds
I don't ship Fluttershy and Dash, but--it's a great friendshipping episode between them at least
"friendshipping"- ayup!
Yeah, I'm not into shipping but the one shippping I find okay is friendshipping.
what are you talking about Vivix ?
0,5The only person who will do any shipping around here is otakon
ohai, BaconMane. :D
I think my--current Fluttershy ship is eh...probably Flutterlight
yohai BaconMane
artist was responding to Rex_Mundi
0,5"flutterlight"
0,5how creative
Well, it's not creative
0,5TwiShy
but it's an easy description rather than two names
0,5that's creative
how some people can't understand "no guns" is beyond me
phase is so suicidal
I kinda zoned out due to chat
0,5Oh god not a gun conversation again
in game baconmane
Yeah. over half the server is pissed off, so yeah
BaconMane we were trying to farm haunted metal
why is peoplle mad?
but yeah shipping- I've gotten affinity for things like, someone mentioned to me, and I can't get it out of my head: Twilight and Lyra
we lost 4 because of people not listening
We're trying to meelee the hhh, but people keep shooting him I think
We were trying to get metal, but some nob head decideds to gun and kill
So yeah, not in the brightest of moods
thats a shitload of tabs
I don't really care SErenity
SMOOZE
yeah Phase4 thanks for the server but ya need to enforce melle only
and then firefox broke
SpeccyRush, would be good but i don't know how :(
Vivix: It's alright, I don't care either
even better if i could reduce the spawn time
or if they dont listen kick Phase4 simple
Phase4: I think you could do it in some server mods
ok, seems that its broken
check ou the server.cfg settings and such
so no outro video
I know there's deffosome server stuff that allows you to spawn him
Aww
I don't know if --TF2 likes that
Well that was fun. :>
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CnOysetlQw here is link
my bad
is almost as good
Yuss, was fun
didnt know we were meleeing
I died only 3 times to the horsemen every other time was a shootable weapon
infernap, we kept tellign you in chat :P
o.O
herpderp
infernap can you not read gamechat
Gold_Demona, that last kill it isaid was yours, you get anything?
/me pokes Snow
i may or may not have been too focused on the game
Thanks to Scream Fortress 2, this might be the only time TF2 is shown on the stream witout setting off my fasting rule.
Bullshit infernap
honest
I don't think so
I'm not really sure
T'was fun.
T'were indeed
I got a couple boxes out of this, so that's pretty cool. Got nothing to open them, but hey. Boxes. :P
So thanks for streaming.
Twas anger inducing is what it was
Only if you let it
Thanks, Phase4 for the stream. :)
i was having so much fun with my demoman :3
Anger inducing?
How?
I got 1 pressie, so not as lucky as you was
sounds like hes letting it
0,5So guys, quick reminder of the art contest deadline coming soon!
Someone used guns instead of meelee
Art! Woo
i notice
again, my bad
I didn't really mind- but I wasn't focusing
It's alright infernap
I cannae draw :(
/me strokes infernap
LOL CountDoofus
Totally can't draw :P
Phase4: god the top comments on that video o.e
Wish I could. :D
artist: Hehe
/me pokes Snow
XD
*Vivix gets a tummy rub*
:D
so, now what do we do
/me purrs
Actually, no. I trace, which isn't drawng. If I were to draw something for real, you'd say "Damn, a five year old can do better than this" :p
0,5You don't have to be an exellent artist to enter :P
yeah yeah
Serenity, yeah. 2.66 refined and it was like instatrade
BaconMane: True. :P
i have key
im busy trying to get in
/me hugs Snow
We finished :<
i would enter but I dont want too
It's really funny because I'm pretty sure I'm sucking horribly at TF2, but it doesn't really feel like it. :P
BaconMane: dont unnecessery ping me! its horrible
i got strange shovel
TF2 makes you feel good, somehow
well, im not a good artist myself D:
:P
I suck horribly at most mp games, but TF2 is still fun whenever I play it- even if it is rarely
FFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!
first tf2 game where ive actually enjoyed myself
ponies just make everything better
I wish I was a good artist :/
GROUP HUG DAMN YOU.

Mebbe
Yep. <_<
Mario 3 music :D
0,5do da de dooo daloo de doodaladedoo
SMB3 was the best of the series
^
Hello BaconMane! :)
Right under SMW that is
ekips: I prefer Super Mario World
im starting to rly see alot of youtube vids with jap writing in em. is it getting rly popular over there now?
Rex_Mundi, Japan doing PMV now?
WELP
I prefer SMW.
Mario 3 comes a very close second to Mario World
Next thing we'll know well see a Pony song being SMW leveled
I just introduced my parents to ponies...
brb gonna go make lunch
And how did it go, Tervicz?
how it go Tervicz?
SM World was the second best imo. But I might be biased to 3 since I played that my whole childhood and World only a few months ago^^
Not bad, I used the pony Polka's
Dad wanted to show off his new TV which does internet
Rex_Mundi, that last bit of the video makes the whole thing for me
haha
So I gave him a clip
Will have to wait for the result, I don't live with my parents
I mailed him all 7 polka vids
he'll prob think its just a joke
^
Maybe
I wonder when we'll have this in Pony song now http://youtu.be/ia1mb0srRA8
i want the underworld song
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4RccigIg3o&feature=plcp
ya i think he'll wtf on that 1
:D
weird
Rex_Mundi: It sure is. :D
Well there is only one PMV which does" a horse with no name"
That would be cool
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhsRx3jBzk
Gold_Demona: good news, Luna has a rockin' italian voice too :$
Here it is, crappy animation though
MadSurge: Do you have a clip of Italian Luna?
so any word on whats happening on halloween here
Yeah Bronystate is gonna get slaughtered.
watchiong luna eclipsed i bet...
Happy Halloween. :>
Why aee we? :D
*are
Mods are planning on killing you all.
:3
.....
Jmo: By me
with science!
Combustible lemons.
Everywhere.
CURSE YOU LOADING SCREEN
Rex_Mundi: not really :(
I know that Either Sum'i or Phas'e wouldn't slaughter me :]
Looking at the address of the Marriot to hold Fiesta Equestria - I know exactly where it - One of my most frequent delivery destinations is just down the street from it :)
Nice! :)
Rex_Mundi: wait, nevermind! :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brpWy1UKMA8&list=UUdbc75o0Q4_eKHdyIAHw8IQ&index=1&feature=plcp
Needs more smiles.
Since we are talking about dubs, the Russian dub is overall nothing special, but Russian "at the Gala" is one of the best versions. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teeT3PlWd7M
Wait wait wait
I have pics of myself with strange women, and I now have a tattoo claiming my undieing love for a "Lasuanda." I not longer have my civic either, its now a bicycle with a motor, and a card that hits the spokes just right.
Italian Boomerang has MLP, but British boomerang DOESN'T
Hm...
Oh. Weekend before halloween.
wow when she yelling and not yelling is rely diferent sounding
Serenity: Ikr
Time for damage control.
I'd like to set up a group to attend - I can book the room far in advance then try to get as many the hotel will allow (at least 4)
Equestria Fiesta or whatever?
Yep.
=P
This is still the best opening http://youtu.be/7dchiYx5Hzo
so are we having a horror movie marathon on halloween or something
alexxm: I hope so!
MadSurge: Luna awesome!
:) my first convention - A-Kon 2004, we had 12 people in the room - people sleeping under the sink, in front of the door, in the arm chair, on the counter...:D - still surprised we got away with it - the cleaning crew had NO idea
Rex_Mundi: Ikr :$
BarbThePopUp: for Fiesta Equestria
I like both openings, but I prefer the original one.
is that opening official or fan made?
Rex_Mundi: and the Twi VA did a good job on freaking out in Lesson Zero :D
Cypresswolf: That's awesome. :D
alexxm: Mabye the Mods have to play horror games like Cry of Fear and whenever
I want to hear Celestia talk in the Royal Canterlot voice
Rex_Mundi: I would actually like to hear that too. :D
whats cry of fear Serenity
I don't think she will ever do that Rex_Mundi
They should do a dynasty episode some day...
if spike uses the royal canterlot voice dose he become dovakin?
With the royals
just wondering
naturesfury: I see what you did there. :P
usually the max per room in 4 - I think I can get away with a few more...:) 600 rooms in that place, they cant keep track of how many people per room
ekips: but wouldnt it be so awesome and intimidating?
Fus Ro Spike?
alexxm: A HORROR GAME :3
but spike himself is a dragon
Basically some random teenager has gone batshit insane
whats it about Serenity
dovakin is dragon slayer
And you have to FIGHT MONSTUHZ
spike = dragon so he is practicly dragonborn
Rex_Mundi slightly out if character though imo.
I'll set a reservation by somewhere in December
your arguments are invalid
Gold_Demona: and in italian, the fun has been indeed doubled :$
out of*
infernap12: The pun is him being "dragonborn".
MadSurge: lol :D
/me steals cookies while everyone is distracted
Gold_Demona: no really, it's been translated as that :D
get the prices per room packs - I can gather people who want to attend between booking & con time, easy enough
BarbThePopUp: Daww :D
MadSurge: That's awesome
BarbThePopUp: fluffy fever <3
so many cookies... hm? Yes yes, very cute.
dat res
This is pretty good too. http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcl6qeAltU1qh1puko1_1280.png

Hi RustyMeat :)

/me lays on ASoftFluffyThing
CriticKitten, a heart-wrenching thing to hear/see

It's hard to imagine that all of these older traditions are slowly coming to an end.
:D
/me cries to Ayejay
CriticKitten: I know, right? :(
Yes, Jmo?
It's all your fault .-.
Wait
How?
Dunno, just is.

CriticKitten, I hope TSO comes back to where I'm living. I really do. Like a couple years ago when they were coming here they were doing a drawing for it. My mom bought two tickets for me cause she knows I was looking forward
;~;
CriticKitten, don't you DARE say that. Ever.
LOL
His face. XD
ASoftFluffyThing: It's sad, but you know, they might one day have to.
CriticKitten, let's hope it no time soon. I'm gonna cry when that day comes.
No kidding. Some traditions just shouldn't end. Especially music and dance.
audio is a bit earlier than video
Yeah.

Shizuka
Crysis and all it's maximums are on.
Suddenly Shizu is Heavy Weapons Guy? o.o
That gun either has terribly bad aim or that guy was wearing like, 5 kevlar vests stacked over each other.
Does he (/she) not know that rockets will follow the laser dot? He (/she) moved it away from the target, causing it to miss.
a little of column A, a little of column B
Well if she didn't she'll probably figure it out in due time.
/me pokes Meanwhile
Hi Panda! :)
/me prods Panda.
ok, works again :)
Nomad, take out that AC130 with your throwing knife.
Testing.
O_o wait... prod?
Oh wait, nvm. :D
how've you been Panda
Shizuka: In case you didn't know the rocket launcher homes to the laser dot, so you can track moving targets for example.
Na.....
Panda: Do you not know the meaning of prod?
Nomad, secure Burger Town.
hey
Na? What does that mean?
Sodium?
No?

Not sure if serious.
Meanwhile, Do everything
Meanwhile: Serious. I'm noit too good with this kind of stuff.

Hello Meanwhile :)
I hate steam so much right now

Hmmm, MvM custom servers can have more than 6 people
...
Steam is really fucking up right now
Chrysalis: this is good news
That guy is very robust being able to take shotgun shells to the face.
Meanwhile: suspension of disbelief
Chrysalis: How many players have they managed to fit onto the custom servers so far?
yeah, im wondering if i could set up a 10+ player server and how it reacts
AJIsAwesome iv seen 10 player servers
SpeccyRush: I don't believe in suspension.
10 players?
Wow.
Meanwhile: you're mostlikely right, but I can't remember
Meanwhile: and no I'm not drunk, just tired again
They only send one guy in to do this job?
Now for the awesome level
It's rifled?
The gatling gu/minigun/whatever?

Bronysith: No, I said Chrono Cross. :P
Gold_Demona: chrono trigger is far surperior
Bronysith: I won't argue that, but you have to admit Chrono Cross had some kickass music.
Gold_Demona: i never played chrono cross, but i heard decent things about it
I really like it. Mostly because I played Cross first.
what?
but Chrono trigger is one of the best JRPGs ever
Linking Books <3
if not the best
Bronysith: I didn't know about Chrono Trigger until after I played Chrono Cross.
Gold_Demona: well at least you recognize the surperioty of trigger
considering everytime someone mentions chrono trigger i fanboygasm
Arent you a little old to be playing in the sand Shizuka?

Right now, it is not time for ponies
Brenna_Hooves: Ponies are show Fridays and Saturdays for sure (And random PMVs). Other times its random stuff
13oh charged is what that was
I relize that
Ooh ooh Shizu, isnt this where you found a birdy?
We need a Bronystate image with "Oh my heavens look at the time" kinda thing
But why Minecraft? I mean, I LOVE Minecraft.... but why is it on BronyState?
and have a clock with every being "not pony"
What's the tex pack?
Brenna_Hooves, why not?
CrimsonPhoenix: Bronystate, all day every day
has the stream stopped for anyone else?
Brenna_Hooves: Because Shizuka likes Minecraft and wants to play it in front of us?
One day I wish a mod could stream Wakfu
Brenna_Hooves: its 4 amusment of the veiwers not show same thing over and over again
CrimsonPhoenix: gOOD pOINT
Cypresswolf: It has many times before. I thought it was just Crysis doing that.
yay~! Minecraft
Brenna_Hooves, I think your keyboard has caught the Lunatist
Ello to all I haven't said "Haio!" to.
13time to breach :3
Breach? Breach what?
One of the symptoms being stuck in CANTERLOCK
13this is a nether world
13there's more underneath
13just watch
I don't see anything....
we need to go DEEPER
/me refreshes
We should watch something like Avatar The Last Airbender
Is the stream working for anyone?
Brenna_Hooves, we've done it already
Korra as well
No. We should watch Evil Dead.
Brenna_Hooves: its wat the admins choose
eddmario: Did that months ago
13did stream die out?
no we should watch Wakfu
?
Yes
indeed Shizuka
CrimsonPhoenix: WHY DO I MISS EVERYTHING?!?!?!
eeyup
yes
I think so.
Shizuka: Seems like it did.
yes, afraid so :(
I've refreshed twice and I have no picture yet
i see Age 83
Brenna_Hooves, because you're one year and a half late
Yeah, I have no stream.
so ur 83 years old
Hold on
There we go
I have picture

Most people here are late, Crimson. :D

CrimsonPhoenix: Its still an awesome show. I wanna watch Rode To El Darado some time!
It didn't say anything!~
Welp, I'm gonna sign off for the day. See y'all tomorrow, Bronystate.

ASoftFluffyThing: same here

Though it did start buffering on that awesome view in that crater
13moment
Should have screencapped it.
13wonder if it's the nukes
Shizuka, how poweful are the nukes are you using? Could be why. :/
:|
13this might not be a cave after all
i think i cause the stream to die :|
updatin tf2
13yeah not a cave
Can someone go make me some pie? please
is there a trollface

>_>
stream's back
YES
I think it was the nukes. They seem pretty powerful.
NO
YES
One thing I find fun is that you can easily fill your inventory with snowballs
hi Cades :)
but what would you use the snowballs for
Make a snowman to patrol your house, attack any monsters.
alexxm: throw them make snow blocks or make snow golem
Snowball fights are the best use

J_E_Smith71, I'm taking precaution
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/8b8834526c709a5d6023661e63f34610.png :D
MadSurge: :D
MadSurge, fund that
MadSurge: :D
Crim has a point considering J_E_Smith71
MadSurge: :D
MadSurge, lol
Saving that pic.
I really thought Pinkie was going to be the sister MadSurge
Ohai flutterchu
MadSurge: That's a good one
13wonder if age 233 will be a easter egg
MadSurge, Pinkie is the DeeDee of MLP
DerpyMuffins: well, Deedee is already a dumber Pinkie Pie
?
Wut
Hey ShiningArmor your wife is calling you
.__.
She is? Uh...Ok gotta go then!
13very tedious trying to find dense ores
^ You bet
Lol
how is this ponies
:(
...
Oh lord
Another one
:D
Here we go again.
13nyansonic: http://www.bronystate.net/faq
^
Shizuka: what exarly are you doing there with these books anway?
dig and dig and diggity dig and dig and dig
that makes sense
plus
diggy diggy hole?
i like minecraft :P
13Sir_Dark_Horst: new ages randomly select terrain generator modifiers
Shizuka pleeease play dig song from pocahantus
13there is one that causes dense ores
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Plushie Compilation #90
you calling Shizu a dwarf? Hat_Brovakiin
yeah, i agree with Chrysalis
>_>
13but you have to get it first before you can use it
Shizuka: i have no idea what you jsut said^^
nyansonic: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/7697/
Shizuka be aware dense ores causes alot of instability
havent used tekkit yet
SpeccyRush: Maybe <_<
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/f254ca5b338a0569c6a6cf940d66040a.jpg Guess who's the Queen of Muffins :D
Gah Pink text clashing with white xD
also been ages since i last touched minecraft
Ponies47: :D
i am
:P
Ponies47: :D
and dense ores can stack, and their instability stacks too, so you can make worlds with CRAZY amounts of resources
Shizuka: does finding dense ores require a certain combination of words?
but they decay very quickly
13it's random
Welcome to Bronystate, nyansonic. Make sure to read the rules. :D
Cypresswolf its a word in itself
Lol
nyansonic: Well welcome then :3
sorry for idling. I'm just trying to finish some homework :/
MadSurge: Hm, I wonder who? :D
thanks :3
Chrysalis...oh the irony xD
Equinoxe <3
AJIsAwesome: that was a fun Dexter's Lab episode
It was. :D
nyansonic: We hope you will enjoy your stay, read da rules, FAQ, and have fun :3
13YES
WHat happened?
heh I'm doing homework too - laboratory preparation... bleh
Aw he left
Fun is forbidden.
? xD
Shizuka: ?
Shizu's a dwarf and he's digging a hole, diggy diggy hole!
Same with opinions.
oh fun
13he?
SO confused lol
Shizuka: The new person.
OH.
Nvm.
Sorry, I didn't know :P
oh yes cause Shizuka is totally a boys name
Oh god I love this song......
ooh minecraft
Did you find what you're looking for?
Shizuka got dense ores then?
nice
Shizuka STACK IT
i like minecraft
it's fun
Stacker!
very fun
SpeccyRush, I thought S u m i c a was a female when I was new XP
^
SpeccyRush: Shh, I didn't know :P
13here we go :3
I was able to tell Shizu was a girl by the pink text, though. :D
I thought SB was a she at one point becasue of his OC :$
ASoftFluffyThing: Sumica trolls new foals on his gender, not to mention his OC DTP makes it confusing for those not in the know
dat creeper
Dat splosion
if Wrek had his way all the mods would be female
That's a big chasm.
Dat hole
Ore-chasm
13let's expose some ore
holy shit
Yeah, ore exposure!
wonder how long until the decay hits
not long :P
The explosions sound awesome in headphones
i just love the minecraft music
i was just researching black hole's and that makes me wonder.........will there be space, as in a HUGE update in minecraft where you can travel into space
Wait that's a bomb? I thought it was a crowbar
13well i assume the lag spikes are decay
is this tekkit or teknik?
Techkit
Wet Hands
Shizuka yeah decay really eats up CPU
Shizuka: Use a mining-laser and shoot up some ore :3
and gets worse the longer a world is alove
alive*
dat windows noise
you have found lapis
decay?
I wanna learn piano again just so I can play the Minecraft songs. I'm horribl <3
horrible*
Sir_Dark_Horst in mystcraft if a world is created with an incorrect combination of words, or the dense ores word
the age is unstable
is this the new update?
and will fall into the void
so much dynamite
I haven't played since 1.2
Strip mining made easy
too lazy to use a pickaxe? use dynamite sticks intead
who won the lottery?
a person did
Chrysalis: what exactly do you mean by age?
what movies
that one with the guy
SeaponiesofLiverpool porn won
and that other one with those things that kill them
and why is the sky green?
I see Shizuka is having fun
13not seeing an effect at the surface yet
Sir_Dark_Horst mystcraft is a mod which allows multiple minecraft worlds to exist in a single save
the different worlds are called ages
/me kicks buy in the nuts
Shizuka you wont for ages
Seapponiesofliverpool: no this isn't the new update. it's a mod
any other mods in there is hosuld know about?
What movies for next week?
the good ones
12 Angry men and somehting else.
I can't really remember.
mega shark vs giant octopus or something
12 angry men and some kind of goat
obsidian dicks in the middle of nowhere? 0_0
Everyone Pick THE POSTMAN for their B movie
AJIsAwesome: Mega Shark vs Giant Octupus
sorry
WHat Buytoast said
And ASoftFluffyThing
MS v GO for WMP
you have found: diamond
i think...
how much dynamite is there
Nether diamond.
MS v GO is not a B movie
more like F
lol, that infinite mining dynamite
Look at Shizuka play with explosives :D
ah. i don't know seeing as i have never played tekkit because i have no minoy to buy minecraft
http://www.ebay.de/itm/271087991810 :)
Everyone Pick THE POSTMAN for their B movie
Dat infinite Shizu inventory
so i'm stuck playingmods that don't require auth
$610? :D
and then LAVA
wow thats alot of money :O
the cost of those custom plushies are too damn high :(
That's a lot of fi- I mean money.
I need $35 for rent, can I have some?
Cypresswolf: Agreed.
^
I <3 explody things
Even someone loaded like me think they are too much
dat fire
I'm not sure if we're the people you want to ask, SeaponiesofLiverpool.
Fire! YAY
Putting fire out with dynomite?
^ GENIUS
fire fire
Lul
Reminds me of the Lyra Plushie I saw before for $1.4k
Gnarly stuff
I try to get commission from my blog, but its been 1 guy donating for the past month
SeaponiesofLiverpool: your local dayjob centre is where you should ask
and then i hit 2 fully charged mfsus with my mining laser
minecraft problems
yi was actually before coming here going to play minecraft and build an adventure map
how do you get so much dynamite
Magic.
Magic. *snort snort*
alexxm he hacked it in
beacause adventure maps are fun
13he?
Is this good art? http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mclz2d3TDQ1r4o7zbo1_500.png
while you are cheating
Derp.
Shizuka: I think he's talking about the creator of this mod.
you lose your gender
At least, I think so.
SeaponiesofLiverpool: I think it is. :)
^
Budgies <3
Drew it from this: http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcelje8gik1r2wrwho1_500.jpg
a book
coolio
Awww
SeaponiesofLiverpool, it tries anyway
Aww, I love birds. :)
but yeah
Love me some birds.
see how he has 111 dynamite?
SeaponiesofLiverpool: I love Bungies :3
looks good, SeaponiesofLiverpool
Bungies.
thats because he used NEI
why is the sky green?
bungies?
and shift clicked em in
Shizuka thats decay
the dynamite gods are not pleased
where the grass has dropped
decay?
emerald green sky is awesome
SeaponiesofLiverpool, it looks very amaturish but with a bit of potential
Chrysalis: ya forgot an s in you sentences
I drew it in MSPaint
your*
MSPaint. Hardcore.
I cannot say it's good but I believe you are capable of more
Tis a good job for MSPaint tbh
haax
and I've seen some great stuff from Paint tbh
Bamboo Tablet
if your gonna cheat
at least do it properly
with EE toys
Woop Wacom.
Woop
13you cheat the way you want
13i cheat the way i want :3
reported to video game police
with low explosives?
JUMP
13yes :)
pssst, nuke it
Shizu sleeps on cliff edges - with NO railings!
why not high explosives :3
Hat_Brovakiin you lose resources
Here's an easy guess game. What episode is this gif from? http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcm9m91GSZ1r5el02o1_500.gif
13cause the nuke kills stream
Shizuka: Your sleeping next to a MASSIVE hole in the ground that if you fell through would indeffinetly kill you?
no rules to follow they said, no one can tell you what you can or cannot do they said. "you can only sleep at night" it said
Mega_Milk wouldnt kill
JUMP
do it
thats a star fissure
you have parachute
if you jump
you go to overworld
mojang you so silly
CrimsonPhoenix: I have no idea
hypothetical question, what would Doctor Whooves dress up as for nightmare night?
Chrysalis: So this isnt a mod?
Tailsy this is a mod, not mojang
Chrysalis: Not with the nova catalyst you don't
Mega_Milk this is a mod pack
this is many mods
CrimsonPhoenix: Putting your hoof down?
Hat_Brovakiin i already suggested EE toys
true
13fiiiine
Chrysalis: So like the regular game if you fall from to high you take fall damage.
AJIsAwesome, good job, bonus point if you can specify the scene
Mega_Milk you dont fall onto ground though
what about laser guns? :3
that hole is into a star fissure
SeaponiesofLiverpool: for lulz or the something more ironic
True Story!
Chrysalis: i know. refer to the post before that one
Chrysalis: What is a star fissure?
holy s6_9t
Mega_Milk from mystcraft, they are used as one way transport back to the overworld
Nightmare Night... Doctor and the Derpy switch bodies
RUN
O.O
CrimsonPhoenix: The scene where the mare cuts in front of her and denies it?
oh wow
damn that was big
/me hugs flutterchu
look at all that decay
Chrysalis: So this isnt the over world?
In Sugarcube Corner.
and all that LAG
AJIsAwesome, you're good, and I'd like to call that scene "the line"
Mega_Milk no, this is an age from mystcraft
Ah.
a customisable world
SeaponiesofLiverpool: sounds like an interesting fanfic idea, but im just talking bout costumes
cat
by c418
Chrysalis: So this isnt even minecraft?? Its something else?
AJIsAwesome, but you're good
Thanks, CrimsonPhoenix. :)
a good song
I might start taking screenshots and makes you guys guess
this is a mod in minecraft
sounds fun
CrimsonPhoenix: It'll be a nice challenge. Please do whenever you get the chance. :)
I have this theory that many can tell the episode from only one frame
hmm
it looks like minecrat
Derpy ina Doctor Costume, and Doctor in a Derpy costume
haaax
given enough information in the picture of course
and that avitar looks like Shizuka
SeaponiesofLiverpool: :D
using deductive reasoning, Shizuka is streaming
and this is tekkit
Yep. :)
dat pig
A pig? :D
damn connection drop?
using deductive reasoning lets watch Sherlock season 2 after this
random pig?
What's a pig doing in the middle of this giant chasm? :D
that's what she said

alexxm: i have been....showering!
pokeball?

Bye, Tailsy. :)
that second movie should be rechosen due to the overabundance of tentacle hentai jokes
Well as a request I have to picture to make you guys guess. http://i.imgur.com/P4542.png
and that its not a very good movie
ohai bronystate!
What is tekkit?
I got it in one shot
can you?
Ohai Brony2447 :3
Brony2447: hey errin!
by that I mean
*erin
SeaponiesofLiverpool: Implying that everyone is immature enough to make said jokes
Can you guess the episode in which this picture is from? http://i.imgur.com/P4542.png
Well....
CrimsonPhoenix: Ticket Master?
>implying everyone isn't
that was interesintg.
AJIsAwesome, You're just too good to be true
motherfucker
plus its on every week on the Syfy channel
I mean EVERY week
CrimsonPhoenix: I'm just anylyzing the scene. It's not that hard, really. :D
*anylizing
We thought it might be harder since it's a small portion
*analyzing
and I did hesitate to tell you the truth
Gah, I can not spell today. :P
13got enough to keep my macerators going for a while :3
Macerator?
macerators.. isnt that part of a minecraft mod?
Macerators grind down ore into dust, effectively doubling the yeild
It seperates materials by soaking them, correct?
Ah.
Nvm then.
Brony2447 yup, Industrial Craft
I'm thinking of macerate.
Chrysalis_: ahh ok thx :)
though Factorisation seems to be taking over from industrial craft
offers a triple yield method
which takes a couple stages
far more interesting
ohai CrimsonPhoenix, brony2447 told me about you too :D
that i did
Why hello Lunacorn|Joyful
Why did this fellow pony told you about me?
CrimsonPhoenix: he said that you were a rule stresser
among other things :D
Now that's just wrong.
I'm the bad guy of Bronystate
everybody knows that
He sure is. <_<
CrimsonPhoenix:suuuure
>_>
eeyup he is >_>
but really I'm not as much of a rulestresser as Caramel
CrimsonPhoenix: well ive always been a rule stresser myself
oh good, have you read the rules?
tis true, Lunacorn|Joyful
and Faqs and about us?
CrimsonPhoenix: yes i have :)
That's great
Going out for a bit, guys. Be back later
Bye, ASoftFluffyThing! :)
13probably should upgrade these to rotary macerators
he always keeps me out of trouble IRL
haha too many times
oh come on i never get in trouble >_>
Brony2447: of course you dont
Brony2447: you wanna talk about random crap now?
Lunacorn|Joyful: why not? :3
all i can see is our names in the chat boxes XD
Panda|LOL: .
How about this one? http://i.imgur.com/G6Mn7.jpg Can you tell which episode this screenshot is from?
Lunacorn|Joyful: i hate corn
Lunacorn|Joyful: WHAAT??! Did you say you dont like corn?

ep
Lunacorn|Joyful: nice job
CrimsonPhoenix: Is it Swarm Of The Century?

SpeccyRush: What're we guessing?

I think we'll get over every rarity episode until we'll get it right.
Elements of Harmony?
Nope
Ok one hint

SpeccyRush, you don't know me and my hints right?
to the astute observer hints are clear as day
she has this expression everytime she works
Green Isn't Your Color?

Suited for Success?
Hint: Rarity looks inspired by something out of the blue but what?
CrimsonPhoenix: a dog and pony show?
the diamond dogs
A Dog And Pony Show?
now if Ninjazz was here he would of got it by now
CrimsonPhoenix: the CMC when they stopped by in Cutie Mark Chronicles?
or the robot race episode
Sisterhooves Social?

DaringDerpy: My top 2 soldiers died on a mission in classic ironman mode.
/me bites Brony2447|Stamp's head off

Alchemist: only two? that's normal attrition.
DaringDerpy: I just researched laser tech and carapace armor it I had to go against 15 chrysalids on a terror mission
tis true i tuned him into one :$
Brony2447|Stamp: :P
DaringDerpy: not just two, the TOP two, meaning two lietuneants, the rest of the soldiers are tier 2-3.
/me sleeps
DaringDerpy: NOW GO TO JAIL! oh wait..
well that music isnt creepy at all.....
Alchemist: in the old xcom you could just send ten noobs and a tank...the new game lays too much emphasis on individual soldiers...
Confound those childhood lullabies! They drive.....me......to..........Zzzzzz
DaringDerpy: I am a fan of the old series, and the six man squad limit drives me mad.
AJIsAwesome: its ok i will help you! listen to solrac and your problems are solved
AJIsAwesome: make sure to have headphones and the volume all the way up

Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Drawfriend Stuff #609
he will turn you into a stamp!
damn thats a lot of stuff
Drawfriend number 3: /)^3^(\
DaringDerpy: basically you have 2 actions per round for every soldier. You can move twice, or shoot once. Or move once and shoot once. there are special moves. What you have seen is the special move called "overwatch". Your soldier will only take a reaction shot if you end your turn by choosing this action.
https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-NVNmaIlXSeM/UI2G3Nnc3MI/AAAAAAAAKWk/tK7_WdrClAU/s1600/LyrasSong.png
DaringDerpy: you can only choose "overwatch" if you just moved once. If you moved twice, or shot once, you cannot choose overwatch.
DaringDerpy, where's the hoodie

I really wanna play Minecraft again with a group of people, we had 3 servers for or by Bronystate members, all abandoned -.-
he says hi to AJIsAwesome :)
Lil_B: Not worth the effort
Lil_B: :<
Lunacorn|Joyful: Tell him I said Hi back. :)
I think most of us can agree Minecraft is the pits right now.
Serenity what effort?
What can one actually do on a minecraft server?
AJIsAwesome: ok :)
Alchemist: depends on the server
Alchemist I just want a Survival Server, mine with people, build with people, fight (together) with people
Lil_B: and no greifing
I always thought it was liie offline minecraft, just with more people, thats why I've never tried it.
Lunacorn|Joyful yes
i hate greifing :<
Alchemist: Most of the time, it is. Unless you mod the server
to be honest every server ive EVER been on i was greifed just for being a brony :(
Lunacorn|Joyful: Can't blame them. Bronies are fucktards.
:D
i'm back what did i miss? :3
Serenity: uhh, ok..?
'tis true
Lunacorn|Joyful: in that case it might help not to tell them6not having an mlp related skin.
Alchemist: lol probably
streams is over, I`m going to watch some anime on my ipad
Serenity: erin says he hopes that is a joke
Lunacorn|Joyful: Tell him, it's the trurth
Truth*
It's a well known fact that 90% of bronies are indeed criminally retarded
Serenity: well.. uhh ok...
You'll learn >:)

Hi, Good afternoon everyone
Alchemist: that was fast
Hello, TheGreatAndPowerfulT. :)
He;;p TheGreatAndPowerfulT :)
*Hello
Celestia`s_Bunny: I didnt do it.
hai TheGreatAndPowerfulT ^^
Hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT :)
hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT !
hi guys
good evening
You okay, Brony2447|Pissed?
I just taped my ipad to my computer screen
AJIsAwesome: nope
Brony2447|Pissed: Why?
Brony2447|Pissed: whats up, are at your friend's?
Alchemist: yeah
whats wrong?
ehh.. someone sent the most heartless email ive ever seen to my friend here and now he is in the restroom doing godknowswhat
Good morrow ded chat
ello AdamTheDuck
Brony2447|Pissed: Oh my. That's terrible. :S
AJIsAwesome: yeah..
Heya AdamTheDuck
Brony2447|Pissed: Welcome to the internet, where people can be heartless as possible without the worry of getting assassinated
anime has the most akward moments ever
was it someone he knows or just a random person?
I'll bbl
Serenity: im sorry but that was just a douchy thing to say right now, i dont want to hear it
Bye oni- and gone
Brony2447|Pissed: Sorry. I didn't mean it like that, but you knew what I meant.
Serenity does have a point, though. The internet is full of cruel people and heartless people sometimes.
seriously, anime shows have the most awkward moments
Funny, there was this story of this one school girl who got arrested for making a death threat on the internet.
Well its easy to get rid of one's frustration and anger on people you dont know anonymously.
But don't let it get to you. You really shouldn't. You'd only be letting he/she win.
AdamTheDuck: She was probably reported
is there a stream?
Nope.
ill be right back my friend needs band-aids
no
Serenity, nah she did it on Facebook
Alchemist: I just shoot birds to get rid of my frustration
thoin i can just sit back relex and link videos
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg5QBrwKF94
AdamTheDuck: That's why then. Pedobook is full of people who are goody with the law
Celestia`s_Bunny: thats one way.
flutterchu: that was...random
http://derpy.me/ULcDp
more wierd anime moments(for me)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwKgMl34HKk

twilight_sprinkle: try refreshing

Michael: refreshed several times
I'm not even paying attention!
If I wanted to start watching gits from the beginning, where should I start? I heard there are many series of it out there

oh bye forever
13so.. stop building glass wall buildings
13dumb city planners
uhh
Use fiberglass
Much tougher
Use see-through metal
make your walls out of sand
i'm kinda disappointed they put in a german character without the bad accent
Is this an ADV dub or Funimation?
Or at least make it safety glass, or fiberglass, or plexiglass
that way it'll turn into glass
use plastic, all the kids are doing it
Domo: I think Funimation.
ekips: um there are only two series I know of, gits sac and gits sac 2nd gig - so just start with the first one
AJIsAwesome: Oki :'o
00,10aniplex iirc
oh, aniplex?
Ah, nvm.

ohai Lil_B btw
MadSurge: what was it?
ekips nice
00,10robot dogs like you just fine batou
Gosh, that dog has it in for him. :D
which makes the lack of german accent in that officer all the more disappointing
twilight_sprinkle: fungi in my ear :(
ekips: HoodyNinja and ekips thanks :) (although I'm in the chat the whole time, but have been slightly less active )
oh, well, guess the budget couldnt find one
MadSurge: so did you just have to use some drops?

Budget doesn't find people, people find people
Sumica: he had the german federale agle on his chest and an insignia wiht the german flag colors on his left arm
twilight_sprinkle: nope, tons of pills, boric water AND spray.

You dont have to be an ass
Help her
I would be crying right now, but I'm not even paying attention

poor kid
I don`t cry to sad momentd
hah, wut u git, springles
moments
they could atleast help her back into the chair.
hoodi pls go
Eh, if he'd lied all it'd have done in the long run is make her eventually think he abandoned her because he'd never be back.
/me is finished with his hotdog
I wood, but im stuck
so if she cant see, how did she see him?
But they got the terrorist! This is a happy ending!
twilight_sprinkle: maybe her chair?

She didn't see him.

00,10it just takes longer to come back
He just waits until i'm on and then tries to demoralize me
Sumica: Same reason I did. Cause this place is like crack cocaine for your eyes.
what sumi said. i dont even exist outside bornisteit, im a Ghost
batou looked old in that shot
HoodyNinja: there are mirrors for that :3
Yeah, I'm more of a visitor rather than a resident of Bronystate :P
THROW MORE SHIT AT THEM
twilight_sprinkle: My mirrors can't talk
Although I've been "visiting" for ten months now
SPIDERBOTS
twilight_sprinkle O_o mirrors for what?
I only leave so my idiot family doesn't find out about this place
panda-mobile: for demoralizing him :3
SHould i get Windows 7 or Windows 8???
sumi dancing to ghost in the shell
00,10that guy is just kinda molded in to that armor.
twilight_sprinkle oh, i thought you wanted to take a pic of your butt

Get windows 7

panda-mobile: wtf?
windows 8 is still fresh and new
panda-mobile :D
twilight_sprinkle cant fit his ass in a pic
panda-mobile: naw
panda-mobile: my butt is classified
panda-mobile: One or da other :3
Sumica: You wanna get work done. But at the same timewrek is drawing something new. But then then you get ready to leave and shizu's got a new game. By this time you know you have to go but then sumica breaks out the GITS and super mario show. Now you HAVE to go but then SB hooks up the WII and after this point you urgently need to go but then phase pulls up TF2. And the cycle repeats.
So many pings O+o
you should wait on actual reviews before moving in 8
I'm guessing Yuri Lowenthal has been around a lot in terms of voice acting.
legolas? the hell are you doing there?
that'S not middle earth
wait, you streamed Super Mario Show?
Yep.
man.
Or was that SB?
Nah, it was Sumi.
Well i have win 8... its a litte faster and a little better. Its just many games arent compatable with it yet :/
Windows 8 r ?
I missed out on that action.
i heard windows 8 is meh

Japan has waaaaay to many mech shows. Code geass diddnt even need them.
twilight_sprinkle1: I know, explosions are my favourite
pony_1707: gundam 00
taoumi: When I got in the elevator if I was you I would have said "Sup ma, how's it going" In the most manly voice possible.

Dont Deny It
taoumi: Man*
oh i did Mega_Milk
HoodyNinja: famous last words
MadSurge: yep... also, batman hates rock n' roll
taoumi: haha Awesome.

00,10make sure you listen for pinkie
And thus the battle of giant robots vs other giant robots has concluded
twilight_sprinkle: Cool, now I don't have to pay those men :3

Passive agressive guy.

In code geass, the non-mech forces like tanks might as well not exist they suck so much in comparison.
00,10Tessa is a badass
Laurayne: So, Pink hair=Kawaii?
00,10afterall she is the captan
Well, yeah
Laurayne: Anime Rule #1: ALWAYS HAVE BUG BOOBS
gundamns come with tents?
Rex_Mundi: but the point is that mechas arent a key point in the story, it could be any other form of machinery
BUG?
Bug boobs? :D
