Meanwhile: Wut o_o
It bumped over a candle and set its tail alight. It was fine though.
i never really played raids... it's totally boring after the first time...
intellect no longer increases mana?
pvp and that's that
i know my cousin said something about fixed mana
i just do raids for the gold
but that's bullshit
Intellect, didn't they remove that?
http://jayisgames.com/games/the-house-2/ Don't play this game
its fixed at 200k at 90, 100k at 85
the real gameplay is the pvp
all PVP is is who can ambush who first
^
pony_1286: exactly
rogues
lawl
I think arena has some elements of skill in it
Does anyone else think LFR is utter crap?
Buytoast: ... you didn't have many good runs then
why is the movie night beginning so damn late?!
Ofc LFR is utter crap, is was made for the people who can't play.
Aryd: arenas are pvp
I have 102K mana
That would be your head meta gem
i've had plenty of good runs
Due to my Human bonus
and it's still teh truth
Hello everypony. :)
And Ragnaros was the hardest heroic in Cata, Dragon Soul was pathetic.
SparklyWaffles: Hi! :)
dragon soul is a joke
if you aren't a troll, you've been playing the entire game incorrectly
Hi everyone! :)
Ragnaros is hard with the staffquest
i mean, finishing a raid is cool and stuff, but slashing a priest and a dk alone after your partner has been killed in arena... man THAT's a nice feeling
hello Sarah
The knock back gets annoyings
*annoying
Uh oh. MMO topic.
/me hides.
Sarah: Hi! :)
mentallyeffedguy: Florida, est time zone
I can never unsee Raggies legs.
Gold_Demona: whats the time?
hello kitty island adventure
/me hides to since he can't join in
Sometimes when I close my eyes they're just...there.
I couldnt win arena to save my life! (Literally)
mentallyeffedguy: 1:46pm
Ninjazz: yeah, we can change topic. i stoped playing wow month ago :)
I have never done a heroic raid except ICC
Gold_Demona: its time to get ill"
ICC was bloody pathetic as well.
MMOs!? So uh.... how about that.... uh... RuneScape!?!
Eli, tried a public server. Couldn't get into it.
private*
I also never did a raid til Level 80
movie night starts at 7pm there and 1 am here, annoying
RaveBrony, pfffff-yeah it was alright.
Meanwhile: burning crusade was awe4some
Has anypony played The House 2?
Aye, but Ulduar is still the best raid that ever came out.
I shall stay up for it
playing it atm sarah
Meanwhile: AMEN!! (\
He feeds on your tears
RaveBrony: /)
Meanwhile: oh god ulduar. "drools"
Best. Raid. Ever
Herald of the Titans is still my favourite title.
They freaking destroyed the Mimridon head mount drop
Meanwhile: cause it just sounds awesome
its now 1%
SpadeMagnes[School]: What was it before?
Meanwhile: much better than "Kingslayer"
100%
:o
Aye, because now you can farm Yogg+0
With idiots no less.
Well to be fair it would be too easy now
I like my 'Loremaster' title... but its not much...
probably 2 mannable in mists, itll cease to be rare soon
Back in my day we had to run five miles in Alterac Valley!
Uphill!
so anyone here watch community
In the snow!
Nothing is more hilarious then unintentionaly getting a Raid achivement
With empty bag space!
My guild got Ping Pong Champion by accident
*days
Last time I checked AV doesn't last five minutes.
and when it does, everyone whines
Meanwhile: it lasts 5 minutes now?
Regradless of the patch, i still hate AB sooo much! :D
I never win it.
And we didnt have your fancy smancy LFR!
We waited hours to make a group!
And we liked it!

Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Music: Aviators - Home (Feat. Poni1Kenobi)
Stopped playing WoW months ago. Still has the same old problems.
I have officially stopped playing with MoP
:\
I'm playing The House 2... I'm in the bathroom...
ah, talkingabout MMOs?
Yep yep
the last MMO to really impress me and give me the "Morning already?" feeling was Rift
Even though Deathwing has been defeated, they still havent repaired Stormwind
Lazy workers
Just because of your stupid totems
Rift sucked
I've got nothing against pandas. Not in WoW anyway, irl they can all go die in a bamboo fire, but the game's just terribly cut down recently.
i quit in the living room, fucking girl coming out of no where scared the crap out of me
Sarah: an actually decent screamer game :D
internet derped
I'm liking Guild Wars 2 so far.
Wish they'd kept in the class blender though.
the ONLY reason why i wanted MoP was to FINALLY murder Garrosh.... but :(
Meanwhile: I heard of an in-game drinking contest :D
gamon for warchief
Not trying to sound like a purist but every MMO tries to be WoW these days
Oh Algalon the raid destroyer..the memories
*Alagon
I remember when Garrosh was just a whiny bitch in Nagrand.
I like Thrall
Now he's a whiny bitch with bigorexia and he's stolen Org.
Meanwhile: alliance or horde?
Anyone streaming?
Bronysith: Yes,.
Lol
Also for some reason Prince Varian has vanished from the throne room
O.o
Meanwhile: and your fav class?
Rogue.
Meanwhile: spec?
Needs more Shaman
Every spec.
I wonder how nerfed Druids became...
Paladin Ftw
Bubblehearth and run away.
i miss vanilla and burning crusade
Damn kitties kicking my arse in PvP
You cant do that anymore
they fixed that
They removed bubblehearth?
They shortend the time
Well you're practically useless now then.
:(
bubblehearth is back in
most op class atm?
I kick ass with healing
Warrior FTW
I self outhealed a pvp Ice mage
I was the only Warrior in my endgame guild. GOT ALL THE LOOT
itll be monk probably, if itlll be anything like wrath and dks
I like I get 5 holy power now
Good grief when DK's first came out, the starting zone lag.
i heard monk dps sucks though, but that their healing is really strong
goodbye my brony friends, im off to be social! bye!
D:
You are social.
here.
Cya mentallyeffedguy
MaxTheBrony: not the same
:(
bye!
bye :(
Also I pray for the day Trade chat becomes decent
AGHAHHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAH
ahahaha
still MoP as topic?
Never
ahhhhhhhhhhh
Why don't you pray for the sky to turn into lemons while you're at it.
I know never gonna happen
SpadeMagnes[School]: thats my favorite joke
Im sort of serious though
BAHAHAHAH
Well, I need to go.
I want people be mature.. for once
Trade chat...decent... Heh
afternoon everypony
Sarah: Bye! :)
evening BladedWings
BladedWings: Hello! :)
Bye everypony!
bye Sarah
seeya Sarah
Or my personal favourite, "[Ferocious Butt][Pounding]"
Theres still Thunderfury spam
and gold sellers..
Wait.... did someoe say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]!?!?
Meanwhile: HA
xD
Dem asian goldfarmers :)
I still have Thunderfury in my bags. Love that oversized lightning rod. <3
:D
Also the prices people sell mounts for are insane
Giant Swords <3
a crimson skellital horse for 14l
*k
did someone say [thunderfury, blessed blade of the windseeker]?
I never got Thunderfury.... I only have the left half :'(
I swear. These games that charge monthly fees. I'm surprised those are even still around.
Sure the thing is a rare drop but still
Meanwhile: how long did it take for you to get thunderfury?
FOREEEEVEEEEER.
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: Where Fluttershy Learned the Stare / Masterplan / Stuck
Like 2 fucking years.
/me knows nothing about wow , but how it is as a game.
I am a pack rat
I have Hakkar's heart in my bank
and C'Thun's Eye
and Hamon's head
I guess as long as there still are MMOs, there always be the P2P model.
hey there...
Dat lag.
heya brony_90
hai brony_90
hi brony_90
brony_90: Hi!
Meanwhile: for an in-game thing? :O That's one more thing to hate about MMOs :(
My Void storage and bank are mostly full of old armour sets.
Oh C'Thun.....What A Boss!! :D
C'Thun was fantastic.
All of the 'raid wipe' vids on youtube :D
from the first blast
Funny stuff.
/me goes to his corner of ignorance and stupidity cause he doesnt know WoW stuff.
Im proud to say i was killed by that in Vanilla :')
bah, i joined late wrath. all i hear is how great wow 'was'.
I'm back everypony! :)
I'm kind of hoping no rogue legendaries appear in Mists because otherwise I'll feel like I no longer have a full set.
alright chumbs, lts do this, LEEEEROOOOY, JENKINS!!!
Welcome back Amber
hai Amber
Amber: Welcome back! :)
hiyo Amber
Meanwhile: Do you have Fangs of the Father? or whatever theyre called
I do.
Nice :o
/me hugs everyone
heya Amber :)
Hey again guys :(
Rogues got cheated with that.... Staff gives you a mount form.
/me hugs Amber back "d'aww"
hey MLP_Brovakiin
Im sorry but is it possible to make a side channel for WoW players to discuss Wow items :S? No offence
Hey MLP_Brovakiin, why the sad face?
Heya MLP_Brovakiin !
Yeah, WoW guys geez! This is a RuneScape chat! :[
Ikr RaveBrony. I'd have loved perma wings.
ravebrony but rogue legendaries give you wings!!!
i think i want to watch sonic the hedgehog Sat AM
Shame they only work like parachutes.
Meanwhile: I thot they allowd you to fly...didnt know it was only slow fall...
RaveBrony: I just feel aweful for some reason, and I fell asleep an hour ago at my laptop.
You cant get Hakkar's heart anymore
So I like it for the collectors value
Void storage is stupid
Why would I want a a bank that makes me pay gold and removes all the enchantments
RaveBrony: Want to know my first encounter with him?
RaveBrony: Door opened and I died instantly to his eye laser
Didnt even get in the room
Which I have built into my cloak anyway.
Wut
Meanwhile: engineering was my profession when i played
You're lagging so hard SpadeMagnes[School].
SpadeMagnes[School]: Yep!! Same here! :D
Bbl this wow stuff is boring to read :(
The dont read it
*then
He's...not.
Now, random question. Fav mount?
Oops, i killed chat
Nether Drake
Lifebinders handmaiden was the one I was using last.
i'm guessing everypony already heard about the season 1 dvd set?
But Pureblood Firehawk is cooler looking.
Ingwaz|Laptop i havent :O
Violet Protodrake
Mainly the drake line
:O MAX
I'm listening to Pinkie's Smile Song while playing Slender. I'm not so scared. When I see Slender, I'll just giggle at the ghosty! :)
ITS ON EQD, GO CHECKIE
Ingwaz|Laptop yup, nad hello thee
Got link :D?
only $25 on amazon.com
Amber: and then he kills you
O.o
inb4 it doesn't get released over here
Pureblood Firehawk would be my fav if i had it. But i only have Ashes atm :(
I found it dont need link! :)

I love I didnt pay 4k gold for maste riding
Getting all the world event achivements for the win
Lol!
Ikr.
Alright, achievement points?

Round and round and round it goes. When it stops? Nobody knows...

Heya QuinnThePegaSistta

RaveBrony what new stuff?
G'day QuinnThePegaSistta
I doubt anyone else wasted their time with those achivements to get the Violet proto drake
Meanwhile: 8915
hi QuinnThePegaSistta
Not bad.
QuinnThePegaSistta: Hi! :)
MaxTheBrony: The Fall crates stuff :P
RaveBrony, achievement points?
hi Quinn
I feel so wellcome today! I dont normaly get so many people saying hi
RaveBrony O.o?
RaveBrony: i don't see the big deal with the new stuff... my tf just keeps crashing
QuinnThePegaSistta it deppends how many of the chatters is actually looking at the chat :)
Theres actually a achivement for getting more than 9000 achivement points
Indeed there is.
ok lol thanks MaxTheBrony
And it's called [Over 9000!]
Is anyone gonna stream soon?
not sure
wrek is eating
dinner
I like the Hat of Cards...too bad i dont play Spy...
and then he will draw some i suppose.
My achievement points total at 12220.
I wonder how big a nightmare the Fel Reaver was in Bunring crusade
I only have about 10k achieve points
Meanwhile: Needs more 2s
Ikr.
Fel Reaver just about made me piss myself when i heard it :D
Fel Reaver was a bastard.
The Fel Bear was hilarious
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNrXMOSkBas
Minding my own business and then "RAaawraawrawr" ded
Because you could never hear the git until he was in aggro raidus.
radius*
Yep
For some reason the fel reavers model glitched into a bear once
Lolwut
Awww you got to experience the Fel Bear?
I read about it
:o
Man that was the best bug.
I joined at the end of Wrath's lifespan
Amber :) thanks for the link
maked me smile
:)
I remember when Fel Reaver was vulnerable to Gnomish Universal Remotes and you could kite him over to Al'ar in shattrath.
Shit must have been hilarious
No not Al'ar.
What's his name...that big floaty naaru.
Naa'ru
Anyone remember the corrupted blood inccident?
I've been having a bad day today.......
A'dal
/me gives Meanwhile thistle tea
A'dal, thanks toast.
Amber: What's wrong?
Corrupted Blood as in ZG Corrupted Blood?
That one
zulgurub <3
The plague it was everywhere.
They made the Wrath pre event cause of that
Indeed, and it was a nice little homage.
anyone else remember the opening of Anqiraj?
Nope
nope
I NEVER got my damn tiger from Zul'Gurub :[
I just wonder who got that staff
/me kicks Cata
AJIsAwesome: My grandpa just died today.... :'(
Damn
SpadeMagnes[School]: on the server i was on it was my cousin
Amber: Oh...damn.... Im sorry :\
RaveBrony: Ikr. Picked up the raptor but never found the tiger.
:'(
Amber: Oh, my................you have my deepest condolences. :(
I have 3 of the 4 bug mounts
I havent even gotten the Panther
I want to get the one via Arch
my best wishes to you Amber ...hug?
But whatever, the Tiger was 10x better
That one you can use anywhere
/me cries
Suddenly, a wild havok appears
/me hugs Amber

Amber: thats what we are here for ^_^
Amber: No problem, I hope you feel better.

Anyone got anything intresting to talk about? :p
Test 123
Applejack?
farming the gold and then once you had enough and all the GOD AWFUL DUNGEON GRINDINGS, you get an awesome armored mount
My sheild looks like deathwing's face
I liked Arch at the start, but all the redone commons piss me off, lol
"Anyone want to talk about stuff?" *quits the chat*
:D
When that panda update comes i'm gonna stop playing WoW...
lol
Hehe
That was the dicussion a little while ago
MilkyWhiskers: Why are you stopping at Pandas?
oh, this is still here?
MoP gives Arch the ability to get certian fragments in exchange for others if I recall
Yeeep
Oooh
i was here when it was first formed
Hasn't ever not been here.
thats how regular i am :3
So was I. And I don't remember you.
SpadeMagnes[School]: Thanks

Amber hi :(
Gasp.
MaxTheBrony: That's epic. :O
what happened Amber
Hi, CCCP.....
alexxm1: its /ns ghost name password
Electrode is the most uncreative pokemon in the world
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7d1WceA7D40 my favrite verison of Pinkies Brew....
Well, welcome back. How are you?
SpadeMagnes[School]: Because Gen 1 gems like "voltorb" where so fantastic
SpadeMagnes[School]: Objection, Voltorb.
Fl00tersh41 - but... Voltorb isn't a gem
he's an Orb
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuyGMCeDa3A :'(
/me pans MirrorImage in the face.
Meanwhile: Can I say both are lazy?
I don't know, can you?
/me softly huggles Meanwhile <3
thanks mate
http://dagobah.net/flash/derping_around.swf IF anyone wanna know how we talk here in Sweden.
appreciate it ;3
Amber - dat Unregistered HyperCAm
SpadeMagnes[School]: There where a lot of unimaginative ones in all the gens of pokemon
I'm not hugging you CCCP.
"So men...we need a evolution for Voltorb"
"I know we turn it upside down and make it bigger!"
GENIUS!
It's a simple consequence of having to make 600+ pokemons
Meanwhile glomp?
No.
/me cries
Meanwhile, hug?
1st Gen pokemon weren't based on ice creams and chandeliers though.
No.
>:
Meanwhile, you owe me, for forgetting me.
hug, or die.
/me gives Meanwhile another Thunderfury
Fiiiiiiiiiine.
dont forget garbage bags
/me hugs Lyra`.
I still haven't seen anything that tops the giant flying shark/seaserpent of doom I got half way through my first game and I used ever since
I dont get why people defend Gen 1 and 2 so damn much ad being creative
*as
Nothing is less creative than that and Voltorb
/me snuggles Meanwhile
/me puts a donut on Lyra` s horn
<.< Right because a pile of slime is origional as well <.<
now, Bronysith, eat it :3
Dabi pls.
/me eats the donut off Lyra` s horn
I dunno, I think a pokemon that mistakable for a pokeball isn't a terrible idea.
<3
ice cream is best pokemon.
Lyra` is secretly a seapony
Turn it upside down...Genius
Meh, what should happen to it?
Meanwhile: I only played B/W :D
it isnt even a secret
I only played Gold. I really don't care about Pokemon.
Besides Litwick is fucking adorable
/me hugs Lyra`
Ill be back later
Meanwhile: I see why people go nuts over them, but eh, not my kind of RPG
Oh, I don't know Lyra`, the scandal, the whole kingdom will know.
/me kills the press
dari, you welsh wanker, get over here and huggle the special hug out of me!
Pfft
/me hugs Lyra`
<3
^-^

*Got to
I must have inhaled some paint at some point to think that was worth typing.
Go buy it dinner, afterwards take it to its bedroom. Show it a good time.
Lawl Meanwhile

Meanwhile: sorry, it was in the tea you drank
My internet is a bitch, but a love it all the same :D
the internet is what every one thinks about other people, but dont tell them

My internet is a troll that I have to put up with in order to live regularly.
Is there a stream up?
Nope
There is not.

White circle inhibits the screen.
Meanwhile: wank?

CCCP: i thougt you should know better than to ask for ponies :P
Bloody cliffhangers.
Wrek

Nah, I'm highlighting him to try and get his attention

Sumica nope not on my side
Reach for the sky
MadSurge: With what console?
It buffered for a pretty appropriate amount of time.
guys, just i case...there is a storm goin on and i i leave (unless i say otherwise) its cause of that ^_^
Okay, much better. Just freezes for me some
its buffering all the time, inpossibru to watch
so, BladedWings, assume you died?
i see a play button
00,10yeah I left it on pause till I could see if it was working
00,10seems to be ok now
BladedWings: Them storms be fierce where you live
Looks fine to me.
BladedWings must be hell of a storm
I'm not seeing the buffer circle, but it's pausing
Ingwaz|Laptop: good enough
PillowPoni: PC, XBox360 and PS3
Also, this song. I must havee
Kandarihu: same here :/
test
Ulthane: I live about 3 hours from BladedWings so I'll probably get it in about 3 hours
BladedWings: where do you live BladedWings? in the path of tropical storm isaac?
PillowPoni and Ulthane yea, its pretty bad
stop pausing if you are pausing you son of a troll
MadSurge: l have a PC but it's out of commission at the moment
Ingwaz|Laptop: idk...i thought issac was done with

PillowPoni: dont see any...let me check
Goal.
i will for now on be more cute
BladedWings: Uh...you'll be able to hear it
Oh, I see. He's too busy dealing with the troll to be pausing the video.
BladedWings: i heard on the radio that it might be coming back
00,10you will be gone
Sumica: im sorry, i will stop being an asshole. :)
BladedWings: You don't /have/ to go outside to check unless you want to be clonked in the head
00,10and what ever this is must be on my end
what's happening now?
Yeah, I think you're right
Sumica: There's not bad weather on your end, is it?

Welcome back SpadeMagnes[School]
Well, thanks for streaming.
But white horse is the worst horse
sooooo....is the streaming done?
PillowPoni: i didnt go outside...remember that big window in the living room...i went there
BladedWings: Oh yeah lol
Ingwaz|Laptop: i didnt know that XD
Cause it's sunny over here
It's nice and sunny in Cali
BladedWings: You might wanna get off your net now before the lightning hits a transformer and fucks with the neighborhood power
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckhtAcqTZEQ&feature=relmfu if anyone watches this, they will be mindfucked, the good way :D
Well I asked my dad if I could have a desktop instead of a laptop
He said no but I managed to get him to think about it
PillowPoni: I got as far as the word "transformer" before I got distracted by thoughts of Megatron.
Balls to it I shall catch the movies at an earlier time tomorow, I am pooped. goodnight everyone :)
i should be cool PillowPoni
His reasoning for saying no is, "You can't move it"
nite MLP_Brovakiin
Meanwhile: Wrong transformer but I give you an A for effort

anyone wanna watch a retard take his tounge in a mouse trap?
so everypony, grand opening today of a chinese restaurant, should i go there for some dinner?
yes
why not
Oh boi.
well, that answers that question.
Ingwaz|Laptop: If you want to
13mentallyeffedguy: I suggest you familiarize yourself with our rules at http://www.bronystate.net/rules
So anyone excited for Season 3 Premeire??
Sure, why not?
LabratoryPony: duh
Ingwaz|Laptop: if you like chinese, why not?
LabratoryPony: DUH
lol:)
MadSurge: i LOVE chinese food
Ingwaz|Laptop: then go for it!
Ingwaz|Laptop: I love the sweet and sour sauce
particularly japanese style food, but i still like chinese quite a bit
Ingwaz|Laptop - that's why my last semester in college was great
moved in with some friends - chinese resturant TWO MINUTES AWAY
PillowPoni: sweet and sour is okay, but i'm more partial to stir fried mixed veggies with a bit of meat in it, and some dumplings
00,10ok, lets try this again shall we?
i like General Tso Chicken
Refreshed my stream
Ingwaz|Laptop: I love the veggies. Especially the broccoli. God, I love brocolli
PillowPoni: I hate it instead... all kinds of mixed flavours, I don't like them...
back to mips
did someone say they don't like chinese food?
get out
Not me.
so tonight sould be a good movie night
MadSurge: To each their own, sir /)
alexxm: how so?
PillowPoni: normally i hate brocolli, but i think thats just because its the way my family always cooked it. i like my veggies to be hot but still be nice and crisp
I enjoy chinese food. I once had Peking duck.
In Peking.
not liking chinese food? that's a paddlin'
00,10much better
PillowPoni jack niccholson as the joker is why
Yep <3
Ingwaz|Laptop: I prefer my brocolli to be steam or cooked. I tried it raw one time. Nope
love my chao min
00,10refresh for stream
alexxm: Whaaa? I've never seen that Batman. I've seen the campy 60s version
Nope. Don't recognize this video at all <_< >_>
alexxm: awwww yeeeae
PillowPoni: well, i didnt mean raw, i meant more like the way it comes when its steamed, rather than boiled.... blech
:3
*yeeeea
alexxm: I love the campy 60s version
steamed veggies are more healthy than raw anyway
Cassy: wut?
Ingwaz|Laptop: Aahh.
PillowPoni: theres a little takeout chinese restaurant not too far from my university that i go to maybe once a week, while some of their meat dishes are good, the mixed vegetable lunch special is great
It was in a couple studies that the body has trouble breaking down purely raw vegetables so therefore got more vitamins from steamed
PillowPoni: I quite agree, good sir/maam (\
Cassy: they are healthyest raw with the peel, no?
what Are those things?
Well, people don't chew their food thoroughly :|
I think it was due to the fact no human chews the required 57 times or whatnot
Ingwaz|Laptop: There's Chinese restaurants just about around every courner where I live
Yeah
MadSurge: /) ma'am. But you can call me miss.
Pinkie Drive!
*refreshes stream* HORRIBLE GRINDING NOIS- oh wait, that's A-Drive Smile
a new chinese buffet opened where i'm at
PillowPoni: okay miss PillowPoni :D
BladedWings: Where at?
PillowPoni: well, theres 3 in this immediate area now, one is really not great, ones the little take out place and the new one is a new buffet
http://i.imgur.com/bfpzJ.jpg what blasphemy.
MadSurge: Thank you, sir MadSurge :3
PillowPoni: where the old Ryan's was
What are these things in the stream called? :D
MadSurge - those are old Floppy Drives
Ingwaz|Laptop: Chinese food, survival for living in dorms
you know, A: drives?
the frist thing i'll do when i arive in berlin on the 30. is walk around the corner at the trainstation, and go to that amazing chinese right next to it :)
PillowPoni: theres a buffet with the same name on the other side of this town and i go there kind of regularly too, wide variety and usually good food so its quite popular
00,10what's an A drive
BladedWings: Oh yeah, I know where that is. They should have put a fucking Golden Corral or something that'll make money there
A: is the floppy disk drive
Sumica: maybe a flash drive? or one of your cd drives?
mmm golden corral
00,10Not a fan of the song but it's good editing
Come Every Dri-ive, LOAD LOAD LOAD! Fill my buffer up with DA-TA DA-TA!
Ingwaz|Laptop: If it's a popular place, go to it.
ahh, that answers that
bye everyone!!!
13A: is just the label typically assigned to the floppy disk drive, on account of it generally being the first available drive to boot from on early systems
Sup
See you, mentallyeffedguy
PillowPoni: true, but we got what we got and will make the best of it...until it closes :D
BladedWings: Yeah....
13a 3.5" drive for A, a 5.25" drive for B, and hard disk was C
Sumica, you're still lagging on me.
yeah, you know you're old if you still refer to B drive for the 5.25" drive
I used to use 5.25 disks
and by old, i mean 20
Yeah, I've gotten buffer and lag on my end.
I actually, predate 5.25's
^^
:)
Well, it seems that B: is STILL reserved for 5.25 discs.
13every program ever started assuming C is the hard drive, so it's stuck since
I'm from the audio tape era
00,10well it's gone on my end
13and i'm pretty sure A and B are reserved in windows for floppy controllers still
You mean cassettes, Cassy?
Shizuka - no, i believe you can assign anything to them at this point
aye
i got little freezes here and there but its cool
Because I remember those as well.
let me go check, i'm pretty sure i could assign an HD partition to A or B if i wanted
Cassy: don't even have to be that old to be from that era
13might have changed
But eight-tracks are before my time.
13i recall trying to set to A or B once and couldn't for either
Gonna take a shower, brb
MirrorImage I think you can.
00,10not sure what else I can do othere then stop all together
but kids nowadays... so ignorant of the culture of datatransmition
13F and up is usually the best range for mapping since it's unlikely any drive windows brings in will need a letter that far up
It's been fine for me Sumica, I blame everyone else.
yeeeeees, DIO!
yep, i could assign A or B to my partitions
And just to be clear, I'm referring to cassettes being for computer software
AH! damn it headphones
:O YES RAINBOW IN THE DARK
\m/
00,10I had to exit steam and restart system
00,10the new comunity shit is laggy
13it's mostly the steam browser
My mom's laptop came with Windows 7 pre-loaded. The main HDD is C, with special partitions for D: and F:. I think the DVD-ROM is E:.
NO SIGNS OF THE MORNING COMING, YOU WERE LEFT ON YOUR OWN... LIKE A RAINBOW IN THE DARK
Funny how both my old computer and my mom's laptop BOTH label my external HDD as I:
13yeah windows almost always sets the main partition to C, with D for secondary partition or optical drive
yeah, but i haven't seen a program in ages that actually assumes the D: was CD
love singing this on Rock Band
and that's even back when A and B were actually used for disk drives
13incoming drives store their label on the filesystem, so long as the host doesn't already have something mapped there, it happily takes on the letter supplied by the incoming drive
Metal + ponies: AWESOME
/me still has a tape drive
MadSurge: so true MadSurge
oops dat double ping
00,10mostly cause the screws that hold it in place the heads are broken off of
13:O
13YES
13YES YES YES
I see. So if I were to build a new computer, and install Windows 7 on it, my External HDD would claim I: there as well?
13IT'S BACK
00,10what is Shizuka?
Kandarihu - if D, E, F, G, and H were all used, yes probably
13http://arstechnica.com/science/2012/09/pong-gets-a-physics-boost-by-way-of-html5/ plasma pong's developer is finally out of hiding
Yeah, all I know about cassettes are the ones that played music.
00,10ahh
Shizuka: Oh that game in your outro! :D
i've got a rather wonky drive layout on my computer...
13or the latest version of it
C, D, and Z are all partitions of the same harddrive
awww
13the plasma pong i have was the last version before the C&D in 2008 or so
E is the actual CD Drive, F is the Daemon Tools CD drive
13MirrorImage: L O and T are partitions on my external
and G, H, I, and J are all reserved for my card readers
13hate card readers.... sucks up so many drives..
Shizuka - yeah, but I needed the SD card reader
or else i'd actually have to shell out for an MP3 player, rather than using my cell phone
00,10I even have a P: drive
*specifically
and besides, it was $20 on a $2200 system
when you get that high up on price, it's really a case of "why not" instead of "why should i?"
My teachers did a flash mob to this on the last day of school
Right. I'll be busy with something else.
Shooot, had to leave for a bit. What have i missed?
PMVs
RaveBrony - drive letter discussion
My brothers first hard drive was 20mb in size and was over a foot wide
MirrorImage: Ah.
Hey Everypony
It's getting hard to remember how my old computer's partitions came about. Let's see. A: for the internal Floppy, C: for main HDD, D: for DVD-ROM, E: for CD-Burner, F: for my 2nd internal HDD, G: when I repartitioned my C Drive to make it a Dual-Boot Linux. H: for a USB Drive I bought.

Why the fuck would you send blood into space
SpadeMagnes[R]: to say hi
So that one day aliens can clone us?
SpadeMagnes[R]: For Space Vampires. du
*duh
SpadeMagnes[R]: Aliens might want a sample...
Why would we say hi to a POSSIBLY VIOLENT species
probes with basic information about earth and mankind. it's a means of saying "hi. that'S is" should the probes that got launched into deep space ever picked up by aliends
doh ho ho ho
SpadeMagnes[R]: We don't want that kind of aliens comming down here to just take a sample.
it's like nero and his harp
I haven't seen the show. Was the prime minister woman a former Companion?
Yea and then aliens that want to conquer us can find us
wat
SONIC BOOM
A rock?
boys... your ship is butt ugly
A ROCK!
Dumb rock.
thanks for the info alexxm and Meanwhile .
DUMB ROCK
I haven't seen this show before, so can anyone explain what's happening?
We're being conquered BY A ROCK?!
Ugly ship!!
Amber - in brief, Earth is being invaded by aliens who have mind control over anyone with A-positive blood type
Damn, Tom has put on some weight?
wheres will smith when you need him
Amber: Earth is being attacked by aliens. That's about all you need to know right now.
i think it needs a paint job
and the Doctor is currenntly out of commission
SpadeMagnes[R]: Its a rock full of advanced mind control technology...
Why are there girders around Big Ben?
PIllowPoni: dont make fun of tom's size
BladedWings: But look at him
Oh, crap I have A positive blood
SpadeMagnes[R]: got hit by an ufo a few episodes ago
Oh wait this is doctor who?

alexxm#
How much into slavery?
1/2
Half.
Thats not so bad...
Its not the entire world
4 billion people isn't that bad?
Whats the point in flying lightyears to another planet, fight off the locals only to sell them into slavery?
Hey the population needs culling
I love the living tombstone
And again it isnt the entire population
Oh god I spelled my name wrongh
°-°
O_O
In terms of acceptable casualties I think that's above acceptable parametres.
Couldn't they just have bred slaves from their own planet like cattle and sold those?
DONT TOUCH THAT

SpadeMagnes[R]: yeah, it was actually an array of spin saws that got remote controlled by three snatas

Those cats are froma super advanced society, in a hospital full of things that can kill quickly and inconspiquously, and the catgirls first choice for quietly disposing of people is to use their claws?

Fl00tersh41: How indeed.
Where did they learn that?
Oh shit
00,10plot calls for it
Fl00tersh41: hive mind sort of thing. Shared conciousness forming a single connected sentience.

kind of Weird
Fl00tersh41, well the cat people were surprised as well
Lyra`: it's on the homepage
ded
Ded
Nasty
NOW SHE'S ILL TOO
The Doctor can translate EVERYTHING, Fl00tersh41 :3
Sumica, i have an idea, youre going to have to go with me on this, but just follow my lead and we'll make it through.
The theory is that knowledge exists in the genes they're being replicated from.
this has to be doctor who right?
/me hugs Sumica
did it work?
Is it not, LunarRepublicGuard?
Rice Krispies taste goood
00,10wut
Meanwhile: so, genetic memory

Mhmm.
ILLNESS TO YOUUUUU
If only they had Wolverine
Disease zombie
Meanwhile: If that's the case, why do babies have to spend so long learning to talk?
now that's interesting
Shouldn't it be in their genes?
welp

Sumica: Might want to rephrase that.
it's okay, she landed on her feet
dat splat
HA!
Cassandra released the zombies
Massive shaft
Can she go any higher with that pitch?
Dark_Horst: and broke her spine
The cats made human clones to get cures for all the didises
Dark_Horst: and shattered her kneecaps
The cats could just have conducted their research somewhere that isn't within spitting distance of interlopers
This is huge what the fuck
Chavtastic.
Like an uninhabited planet

GAB. FGAB. GFAB. I feel like that's a code for a very complex and ellegant insult.
Wow, it's been almost an entire year since the debut of season 2. Hard to believe it's been that long already
is it normal that this isn't a stream :o?
:<
This God? Absolutely nothing.
Here's a bit of trivia: Who has seen the Batman movie? the following bit of trivia contains ponies
That LONG?
So God is a brony, who would have thunk it?
I will now strive to go to Heaven.
Oh, Hopefully it means they're planning something big
/me is listening to Erasure-Always.
Dark92Enigma: which batman?
JUST SO I can watch MLP with God.
MASF123 Apparently. Also satan
00,03Oh we have something planned...
Well no stream. So might as well go play TF2 for a bit. Gimme a ping if a stream comes back. :)
BladedWings: the ORIGINAL one
Benickerson 13 episodes so they have time for a movie maybe :P
BladedWings: 1989
oh ow
I think the stream has crashed
Dark92Enigma: then yea, i seen it
/me listens to Anamanaguchi and covox
according to a article i read that my little pony promotes satan
00,03Nah, we're getting set up
the main reason I want BF3 premium is so I cna get guns that actually break skin.
It's not crashed it just isn't on.

G2 and G3, however...
Come now SpadeMagnes[R], devotion is one thing but when you're called you've gotta shut down.

Oppan Gangnam Style
hi
mother of god this song is SOO AWESOME

05,15I could have done Call Me Maybe
atleast it's korean, and it sounds nice
RAWRity, it is in Quebec
And you would have been righteously stoned.
I need to learn korean so I can translate this
Heeeeeeeeeeeey Sexy Ladyyyyyyy
fluttercry: but you didn't, and that's why you're not Carly Rae Jepsen
Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeey sexy laaaaaaady
RAWRity: give it time. and i care because as long as pop gets this, well, popular, itll never die out and we'll be stuck with this cheap crap for many more decades
damn, this is catchy

twilight_sprinkle: pop will always be cheap crap
Quick_Thinker: DO IT, FILLY
twilight_sprinkle: oh no, then we'll have to like, look on the internet to find bands we like!
cowvarkian: if people didnt buy it and support it, theyd be forced to stop making it

O_o
So, my schools Senior prom theme was elected this year
/me dances.
I found most stuff I like on the internet
It's Scooby Doo
twilight_sprinkle: wouldnt it be nice if people were smart enough to do that
StinkomanFan: What?
/me does super fly dance moves
:D
...and THAT is why I love Psy's music. Your faithful student, String Shredder
RAWRity: a lot of great bands could use a part of pop fame to make better things. i know a lot of good artists who are unable to get anywhere because of pop
I shit you not, it's Scooby Doo themed
StinkomanFan ours in Anime
O.o
They are break dance fighting.
/me joins Ninjazz in danceing
....
Dirt 2 YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Seriously, people who bitch about pop music are either trapped in a logical fallacy or don't have the mental capacity to google different bands/music.
StinkomanFan: which scooby doo
Uh....
OST?
really?
/me dances with TheWeirdPony and Ninjazz
Who did this? WHO PICKED AN OST!?
DAMN DIS IS GOOD

05,15uggghhhh
StinkomanFan: Groovy
ERMAGERD FRERDERH NERGHT
twilight_sprinkle: a lot of great artists never get big in the popular conciousness. That's what niche scenes are for.
hi
......
/me SCREAM "EVERYPONY DANCE" then goes dance fever
Hey Reactor
this song..is awesome
05,15Tony Hawk Pro Skater had the best soundtrack....just saying
why does everypony hate this so much?
I'm with fluttercry
I don't hate it
100%
00,10requesting still images to be streamed on a video site.
TheWeirdPony: because we can
my face had the best soundtrack
For instance, I can guarantee nobody here knows who the hell The Holy Mess is, but I'm not going to bitch about it.
*BUZZ* WRONG BREAKDOWN HAD BEST SOUNDTRACK
no way crazy taxi had the best soundtrack
I don't hate it either. its just boring looking at a pic.
internet derped
Sumica: lots of cool songs with no videos
This music sounds nice
RAWRity: yeah but they need to money for better support, not to mention they deserve a reward
I like reverb
00,10get an ipod then RAWRity
earthbound had a great soundtrack
also guys wearing my twilight hoodie you guys helped me keep... by the way STILL BIG THANKS FOR ALL THE SUPPORT
this is rather boring
^
you guys have short fuckin attention spans
true dat
This is kinda boring
http://derpy.me/Zrmls
Good job they came to a 5 hour movie night then
twilight_sprinkle: reward? what? That's not how business works. You want more money, you've gotta be lucky, have the right sound, and be in the right place at the right time to get a hit. And even then it's rare as hell.
cowvarkian: nah. I can pay attention to boring, but it does not mean I want too.
I dont watch music videos anyways, so I dont care
id umm what would i do with derpy hmm
derpy for whole day..... MAKE MUFFINS NO REGRETS
RAWRity: if the industry wasnt too busy mass-producing pop for the sake of money, it wouldnt be so rare
wow catchy
Michael: Eat muffins.
You sound like Nittany.

So when does Johnny Depp show up?
Dirpy! doen in front!!
ITs the MAN-BAT!
04Once upon a time, when Gotham City was stuck in the 80's...
05,15Before Tim Burton knew who Johnny Depp was
OPP OPP OPPA GOTHAM STYLE!
sooo batman and then starship troopers ?
:PP
Midnight_Fyre: eh, even back then he was hit or miss. After this he made Batman Returns after all
Taxi!!!!!!!!!!!
lololo
Count-Bleck: write now /join Twilight_Sparkle :)

Be assertive!
Back when men were men and information was something you got from a BOOK.
welcome to Gothem, we have the worst police force in history
It's Bruce Wayne!
darn i love so much batman series
/me remembers Zubatman lol
gotham city = night time new york
Meanwhile not that kind of Burton film
Ah yes, "Books"
(No, I didn't live then)
00,10that seems like some one wanting a time out to me
White man can't get a taxi
long time ago.....
We've dismissed these claims
Gotham City, why u no have better security?!
the 30's infused with the 80's
Well gee
Back. Stupid glitches.
04In Gotham it's always night
Hey Hey, come over here and have some fun with CRAZY TAXI!
Kammerjunk: and when hot MILFS were 30 or 40 and not under 18?
Thats not Bruce or anything
eehh, three and a half hour until my train arrives
Books exist, I tell you!
lol
01,11One thing I *didn't* like about the old batman movies: Gotham just looked stupid. It was too over-the-top and exxagerated.
IXAT.
And to this day, batman has an irrational hatred of cab drivers.
cowvarkian: actually, that would be awesome.
04>Crazy Taxi
inb4 they die
Bronysith: oh my
Lies.
What did I miss guys? Any interesting characters or peoplE?
Always know that some time in the future, books will be considered primitive.
inb4 tragedy
04Oh my, now that's nostalgia
Now this scene is very reminscient of Batman's origins
dis moment
Gee, who that kid could be?
05,15Silverscreen well....Tim Burton
cowvarkian: IKR
inb4 BANGITY BANG BANG
Seems legit.
Sneaks: It just began
And will likely be only the talk of historical fact.
The thing about Tim Burton is, with the exception of this, when he is doing something original it usually turns out pretty good, and when he is basing a movie off of something else it's usually, well, not
00,10this is over the top?
Inb4 ded
that was what made Gotham... GOTHAM
01,11good point, fluttercry
BAD idea
lol
inb4 raep
otakon: seeing as it IS batman's origins...
not nearly, Sumica
Don't walk down Crime Alley. It's called Crime Alley, for God's sake.
lost of people! lol
Holla, holla, got $?
Gotham is not Los Angeles...
A dollar!> RUN!!!
Sumica maybe a little
hiya Ghosties
aight, I've adopted a Batman monicker, I have my imaginary popcorn, I'm all set
04DO THEY SPEAK ENGLISH IN WHAT?
OH NO.
I need about TREE FITTY
If he only gave him the dollar
Don't walk down any alley, nevermind Crime Alley.
HE should just use his iphone to call a taxi
dat yay
At least he wasn't asking for 20 dollars, like Slenderman does
yay
yaya
Ghosties: What?
Darwin Award goes to....
AND I WANT HIS UNICALADE TOO
she screamed
OH MY GOD, I JUST REALIZED SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT!!!!
Und dann she screamed.
BAT TEEN!
call a medic
Dark alleys = bad news.
Meanwhile: For the moment, I'm looking forward to retail stores becoming too inefficient.
01,11Don't scream.
01,11*screams*
Midnight_Fyre: more like even when Burton's doing something original it's derivative as hell.
hes only knocked out
he only hit him
Silverscreen: Don't Blink!
I heard yays!!!
00,10dat animated shadow
"No. No screaming. No yelling or hollering either. Okay?"
what was that!
inb4 Batman
I'm Batman.

Wait that's not Bruce Wayne.

I never noticed that was animated before...
INVERTED TAKE DOWN
Ghosties: is fiun allowed in here?
RANDOM OPPRESSOR TRIVIA: The first time I watched this movie was in a summer day camp in 1990. I was 12 years old. And since this movie is PG-13, my mother was none-to-pleased.

@fluttercry tell me about bears and rabbits

The one thing the Arkham Asylum games lacked was a button to hit that let you whisper "I'm Batman" menacingly.
Is it really Lando?
WHY SO SERIOUSA
I'm Kevin Bacon.
01,11Dent is black. Your argument is invalid.
I'm an actor wearing a suit.
aka twoface
fluttercry: Pray he doesn't change the deal further.
I'm back, guys
yes, this is Lando
I believe in Lando-i mean Harvey Dent.
when did that hapen is that accuraTE
I'm Stoned
Then Billy Dee Williams

Hi Amber!
otakon: It is clearly the only part that isn't armoured though
And then Billy Dee Williams became Tommy Lee Jones.
Billy Dee Williams, we LOVE YOU!
Wrong tab.
ohai Lando Calrisian
I forgot. What movie was Two-Face in?
Hey, it be Lando
did they say harvey dent?
:)
00,10I am a man of few words *sits down*
So Gotham's white knight is black and it's black knight is white.

LANDO CALRISSIAN FOR MAYOR

Harvey dent is a black man
Harvery Calrissian.
When did Harvey become Black?
Lando is the bst mayor, he fought ghost you know
Lando Dent
"I'm aman of few words. ...Good night."
This guy looks like the guy from the C&C 3 campaign, Director Boyle I think.
*Harvey Calrissian
*best*
flutter_spin: not Pooty Tang dammit
This Batman?
oh hai Jack
I BELIEVE IN LANDO CALRISSIAN
Twerlet_Spaykle: michael jackson reversal
Gordon Freeman? :O

Russian Girls love Batman.

String_Shredder: Harvey Calrissian
Vote moustache.
HEEEEEREEESSSS JOHNNY!
Oh
13DashWithRainbows: i saw him in something... forget what though
My
I thought no one was saved from old Star Wars, except for Harrisson Ford?
Dat Nicholson.
God
then Jack Nicholson
Guys is this the film with penguin????
dat sexy voice
hiya Shizuka! How are you?
I wish the media would have stayed like how it was in the 90s but with the technical advancements we have now :/
no
Heeere's Jackie
hmmmm
harley quinn
JOKER
No, it's the one with the Joker.
nope its the joker habrdsh
what measurement?
JOKER JOKER JOKER
Tomplchan: What? No Mark Hamill?
though really, A sack of heated shit>>>>>>>clooney
Ugh...get to the Rainbows! D:
also, who's is the better Joker?
oni_link, yeah
Mark hamill is a legend
this one
The guy who voiced the Joker in the animated versions?
shogipony, Harley is nowhere in there
otakon: definitely Ledger
Shizuka It's mostly the voice that makes it seem like the guy I'm talking about. Lemme just go check google.
MARK HAMILL IS BEST JOKER
Jack Nicholson is god's best friend
01,11Jack Nicholson was a good joker. Perfect for Burton's version of the character.
Tomlpchan Mark Hamil had an good career in voice acting
All work and no play makes batman a dull boy
agreed
dat Jackie *remembers Anger Management* 0_o oh god he sleeps in the NUDE lol
Mark Hammil is good and so is Heath Ledger and Jack Nicholson. They are all very good jokers.
00,10defenatly Silverscreen
Mark Hamill turned out to be a better voice actor than live actor.
05,15DashWithRainbows yes. that's him. he's also Lando from Star Wars
Jack Nicholson is 2nd best joker
You look fab
Actually I could have SWORN that NC did a New VS. Old for the Batman movies
Oh, wait, he's not Joker yet.
ouch
This guy's good, but Ledger was another level.
what are we watching today
That gotta burn
I think he's best Joker.
Ah, cheers fluttercry.
Dat tie.
BURN
ledger was just insane
Damn. He's. COOL.
whats this?
Ledger sells crazy psychopath
Gnight, regs.
Batman.
otakon: he did
night Ninjazz
night Ninjazz
oblicody 1989 Batman
"Ooaah wwoahahah"
BATMAN
Yeah he did a great job, but you know, Ledgers gonna Ledge.
05,15Ledger made him seem real. Nicholson plays him like a comic book
BULLOCK!
lol
no i mean that looks like harley quinn
05,15Both are great in their own way
It's Commisor Gordon!
MrBen: I think Harrisson ford is still the only one who "survived" as an actor in the long term, at least he's the one who'll be remembered
where's gordon?
just keep watching, kinda hard to miss what it is
fluttercry: oh a COMICBOOK?!
:)
Actually, I wish the media could be like it is in every fiction where the media doesn't play a role.
DashWithRainbows: Are you able to change the color of your text?
Bat Attack
bullock
What does a bullock have to do with anything?
AJIsAwesome Nope. Colours are for mawds/
Bats
lol
yummy draino
they had a Batman # 1 at dragoncon
dat voice
Okay.
jack nickleson was asked to be the joker in the dark night, but recomended heath ledger instead
in shrinkwrap
Meanwhile: not bullocks
boo
That Knox guy sounds like Bill Murray.
the bat is a lie
giant bat? didn't look like that
Who is best batman AppleJack, Luna, or Zecora?
a giant bat banna
Bats.... or Aliens
Only one option, we gotta nuke the bats
Giant Bat.
Batman 1989 = Comic book brought to Film. Batman Returns = Tim Burton movie in Batman Drag
wahwahwah
I'm telling you man. It was a giant Zubat.
so much money it was worth
banana peelz are dangerous man
Giant Bat!
AlienWarhead: Luna
I gotta say: Joker character have one of the best impersonators
that bat is a spy
Is this around the time Batman started....in this time period I mean.
lol .
ohhhh
When you really think about it though, Nicholson's Joker is by far the greater villain. He kills thousands of people for shits and giggles
pwned
Meanwhile: Bullock, he was a detective in the comies.
no
:D
cant argue with that
This guy gargles with nails.
-off all comic villains
DIZZYRATCHET: Wrong, that bat is a MAN!
They say HIS PARENTS ARE DEAD
hi everyone! ^^
Batman Forever = shit, Batman & Robin = cancer in film form
Batman started in the 1930s.
Batman started in teh 1920s-30s
Aircrafter thats what ive been tellin everypony! its Zubatman!
twilight_sprinkle: The nightmares............I'll never get first place..........
Midnight_Fyre: yeah, Ledger on tries to do it

Hi Optical! I love you!
Press comes up with wierd theories
"I say, your full of shit." Epic quote.

Hello Optical!

habrdsh: hamill ledger nicholson
smokey car
corrupt cop is corrupt
dat mafia
He is the hero gotham doesn't nee- oh wait wrong Batman
habrdsh, you have it wrong
shaad aap
1st comic with Batman was released in 20's, i think. But Joker not appeared til' 30's
hey, you LISTEN!
Dat corruption
HArveh Dent?
Its only in my opinion
Harvvvvey Dent.
Are those ponies on the botton of the screen?
Back when everyone must wear a hat
im buttman
Dent's in this movie
that's right
its 1) Mark Hammil, 2) Jack Nicholson, 3) Heath Ledger :)
Eyeup.
No offense, but I HATE Joker as some sort of former mafia asshole
that is not harvey dent
let's insult the crazy guy
Amber: Yep.
JACk
Jaaack.
ha, jack
:)
Amber: Nope. Its just chuck testa. ( yes they are. )
I'm with Ryunosuke
And his japanese equivalent, Halvey Dentu
yeah, Jack.
Ponies like batman too
Amber: Indubitably. Tis a sacred tradition for movie night
ah and his right hand man
Amber: I see you are new here
Where's Bob?
Damn dirty cops.
there's Bob
BOB!
There he is.
01,11Main Man Bob.
Whooo, smooth today :D
good thing his helper monkey was there.
1.Hamill 2.Romero 3. Nicholos 4.Ledger
DAMN DIRTY APES
ah, Right Hand Bob
Bob the goon
BANG
guy appeared from back
Wirisme everypony likes batman
04OKAY
Joker is a crazy phycho who doesn't care about moneh
We can just call him Jack N.
that laugh
So when does he become Joker?
04Now, maybe that'll work
Ghosties: what's up oh temporal one?
01,11mitamaking: you put ledger behind Romero...?
Ghosties Discord is best joker :p
I'm thinking 20-30 minutes.
Aw, Rainbow Dash looks cute with her wings out! :)
Problem with Nicholson is that he's just playing the usual Jack Nicholson character.
mitamaking: Awwhhhh sheeeeeet
Twerlet_Sperkle: later
I love Romero
Bob; the greatest henchman of all time
this Joker is a much more "dangerous" villain, but Ledger's was more inruiging. he wasn't interested in destroying Gotham so much as he was making it destroy itself, all while fucking with batman's psyche.
Batman appeared in 1939
Yay hotdogs
I'm fine with that
who was romero?
There is Harvey suave Dent
Haha. Ceasar Romero.
It's my party!
LANDO ?!
Ehrmahgehrd, Twerlet_Spaykle
Gotham City looks scary. ;_;
04Dude, isn't that...what's his name
mainly for ledger
....Man...Lando stop being SEXY
Buytoast: Romero played the Joker in the 60s live action version
So Gotham is 223 years old, huh?
hire Pinkie Pie to plan your party
05,15Ledger and Nicholson are both fantastic. Nicholson plays him like a comic character, and Ledger plays him as a real psychopath
oh
That's what Gotham City is supposed to be.
04Damn...Carl Winslow?
that one
TDKR was... okay
1 batman ha ha ha
05,15I don't think you can really compare them
Ghosties, I am sure he has a name
whimsical as all hell
Didn't watch.
pikoBat: you should see Arkham City
Theres always appropriate for a party even when there in debt, Pinkie taught them well
Hi, everypony!
Ghosties: Billy Dee Williams
Bob Kane
dat art
04That's it
Hey Pinkie123
Man Billy Dee would have been good as Two Face
04Thanks
Lol
dat realism
batman...literally
I personally thought TDKR was better.
BAT LAWYER
That awkward moment when you walk by the batroom door and your oldest brother is singing Everlong O,O
Jack N. can be shorthand for both the actor (Jack Nichalson) and the character (Jack Napier)
Hear it's good.
Dem legs.
fluttercry Discord is best joker, DUH
Bob Kane is the creator of Batman.
OH MAI
ohai Pinkie123
Pinkie123: Hi!:)
Buytoast: Yeah, the guy who refused to shave his mustache for the role
hellooo nurse
01,11nonono, that was ManBat
Ghosties: And Lando is Harvey Dent. Also, you're welcome
ah legs
That bat will probably become another one of Burton's characters
dayum
That's Manbat not Batman
Hamill is the true joker in my heart
I just felt like TDKR could have been great, but settled for merely good
LEGS LEGS LEGS
yeah, now i know the guy
sliverscreen sumerpan :D?
CrimsonPhoenix: he does the best voice
04I was away for a moment, which one is Harvy?
lol
habrdsh: Yeah, but it's run by a bunch of madmen. No city run by normal people should be so creepy.
Vicki.... bleh
04*Harvey
Lilly Lilly legs Lilly!
Ghosties: Lando
I actually have not seen TDKR yet. Just been so busy lately
It's Vicki.
I think Hamill's Joker is the very best one.
for one thing it pulled a complete 180 on the themes of the last two movies
Ghosties: Lando
I honestly don't get that.
Ghosties: Billy Dee Williams
"See? Pictures by VICI VALE!"
Ghosties: lando
Randomnerd Ermahgerd
she could get hurt reading a magazine? life is wild
harvey is langston from stor wares
Mark Hamill did the longest joker
The black one
Silverscreen: manbat is best hero
Ghosties: Billy Dee Williams a.k.a. Lando Carlissian
04Lando...like, Lando from Star Wars?
she likes bats
Everlasting_Joy: Candygram for Mongo!
for another, the plot was recycled and the motivations made no sense
Ghosties: yes
Ghosties eeeyu
Ghosties: si seniore
01,11Hamil, Ledger, Nicholson.
Ghosties: The one and only
I like trains!
Ghosties: eeyup
"I really like her mane!"
Yeah, I agree. I LOVED Mark Hamill's Joker
Silverscreen, no wait I think it's like a man-bat pig?
ManBat vs Sumerpan! :[
i liek bats
buffer
Romero Silverscreen ?
i g2g guyz cya
04Harvey Dent is black in this film?
also, bane's voice
Ghosties: Yeah, same actor, not same character
DSNesmith: recycled? what?
I like pie
she must have a bat fetish..... you better run Batman
yes
04Ohhhh
I guess shes gonna be Bat GIrl
YEs
well
No, stay away from Gotham City because usually you end up as a hostage or a villian.
before we start
Wow, 255 people here......:O
yes! Ghosties
anyone afraid of spoilers?
Ghosties: he's black in the animated show too
Ghosties: Yes. Yes he is
Harvey is arguably black in TAS
He's Harvuy Dent
Is Sumerman best friend Bamtan?
01,11Though Hamil and Ledger, IMO, are on the same level.
yes
dat significant number
Gersbuermps
05,15NO SPOILRES
damn buffer
Ghosties, eeyup.
wait...catwomens in the seconed one, batman returns, right?
Nope.
Wasn't Harvey Dent black (well, part black) in one of the cartoons too?
no
Hello everypony!
04Huh
spoil and die a worse death
lol
Nope.avi
Ghosties: not sure if in the original comics
Yes.
Hi Joy
DERPDERPDERPDERP: THE cartoon
As far as the animated Joker is concerned, I think Hamill did the best portrayal. As far as live-action is concerned, I feel Ledger had the stronger performance.
05,15tis an insta ban.
Joy: Hi! :)
hello Joy
okay, then I'll limit it to the plot of TDKR was too similar to BB for me
dat scale model
AJIsAwesome: Ain't we just awesome
I like Mark Hamil MUCH more than Heth Ledger.
ohai Joy
Harvey Dent is white in TAS
DERPDERPDERPDERP: one of the goddamn BEST cartoons EVER
spoiler alert, something is going to happen\
what the heck does NICETAS mean?
Howdy Joy!
HIYA CURLY!
AJIsAwesome: There was 5000+ during canterlot wedding
MLP_Brovakiin: Yep. :)
Hi Joy :D
no spoilers in officially sanctioned chatrooms.
i'll go to mainchat for a while
Silverscreen Hamill played him as what we would WANT from the joker; Ledger plays him as he would actually BE
Jabby Jabby.
otakon6_9
there are children watching, watchyamouth.
habrdsh: WHAT?! :O
Sure, TDKR's plot was based partially on Knightfall, but no more than TDK was based on The Killing Jok
Dem cards.
This Bruce fellow seems like an interesting guy. He probably isn't very important in the film, though.
dat suit
what he said
Jack Nicholson swag
well fuck, OohShiny
AJIsAwesome: Yep everyone tuned in
Who me?
otakon: I used to love it too, I didn't remember him being black in that one though. Guess so.
Jack is a great joker too, I just hate how the character is written
It's a trap!
That foreshadowing
dem purple suit
sup Joker
FORESHADOWING
dat card
Foreshadowing!
habrdsh: That's amazing. :O
hello foreshadowing
lol joker
Thugs-4-less order now
Oola
lawlz
Jack nicholson makes evrything better. You don't put Jack nicholson in a movie, you make a movie around Jack Nicholson's character
Foreshadowing Harley Quine
:)
Okay, I said 20-30 minutes, but no. I'm thinking he goes Joker in 10-20.
he's even got the purple suit on
This movie was the Kittys Titties growing up
Dat tie.
"POUT"
Dat POUT
So The Joker isn't the Joker yet?
And I suppose the woman was Harley Quinn.
:D
fucking hell
Funny, I don't think I've ever actually seen this movie.
MASF123|: yep
MrBen, no
Y SO SEWIOUS
i give it 5
I hate Joker having a name too
dead old guy
He's not the Joker yet.
Tomlpchan: Jack Nicholson plays Jack Nicholson, you work in the other characters later.
01,11Hamil was legendary as Joker's voice actor, but I think Ledger should get a bit more credit for bringing the character to life on a whole new level.
Harley was a psychiatrist
Aw man, I love the Kidder, he's my favorite mean dude.3
Crimson: Didn't think so. :)
habrdsh This movie predates Harley Quine
You.... are my number one.... GUY
as i said before
MrBen Harley Quinn is from the animted series, So...no
folks
ded old guy
Creepy fellow, that one.
if they make a FFVI movie, they need Mark Hamill to voice Kefka...it would be animated of course
Deadlypon3: Didn't think so. xD
Harrly wasnt introduced till the 90's
Oh, Jack Palance... King of the breathy delivery.
def Silverscreen
I forgot: What's the Joker real name in this movie?
Lucky deck
Belive it...OR NOT!
Jack Napier.
I think Ledger overdid it, I prefered Eckhart in it
Jack Napier
05,15Remember the guy line...
*Joker's
there's something about the atmosphere alone that makes this movie feel so iconic
Huh. I've got a lucky deck too.
dem smiling exchanges
ALienWarhead: WHen was Harley first introduced
Bigger Bad?
Meanwhile: ifyouknowwhatimean.jpg
tnanks Wirisme
in the animated series
"And not for the better!"
i beleive
*thanks
01,11mitamaking: Overdoing it is the whole point in the joker. He's over the top fromt he word go.
It may be lucky, but he sure ain't playing with a full deck.
and Rose Petal:)
Dat castle.
No really, cards. I shuffle them to stop my hands being idle.
Speaking of Exkhart...
iv never seen this movie they say the old batman movies suck
damn internet derped on me
habrdsh, iirc harly was introduced with TAS
wayne mansion?
*Eckhart
habrdsh Batman the animated series she got into the comic later
Not gonna lie, I always liked Mad Hatter and Ventriloquist. Guilty pleasures?
we need to find yugi moto, and we gonna take his deck
tis looks good thoigh
CreativePonyName: who are they
Buytoast: you belive what?
Silverscreen the whole point of Joker? To just mess with the batman
Well Ledger killed himself doing it
I say!
Harley Quinn was introduced in the animated series
One other thing I like about this movie: Batman is portrayed as an otaku.
"is he saying deck or dick?"
AlienWarhead, you RC.
DERPDERPDERPDERP, you have your villain preferences
unless i'm mistaken
Well, im gonna go get some pizza, bbs
Alfred!
CreativePonyName: The original "Batman" is an awesome classic. Every movie after it sort of went downhill (even though they are still entertaining)
At the Gala, At the Gala
"Its best not to ask"
DERPDERPDERPDERP, personally I prefer the Riddler
^^
05,15CreativePonyName only Batman and Robin was bad.
Hmm this party needs baloons
It's Alfred.
troll
R.I.P Alfred
Mr. Freeze was probably one of the more interesting villians in my opinion, if only for the tragic background of the character.
Such a CLassy party
He's this reclusive guy who sits in front of computers all day and doesn't like interacting with people directly
Kandarihu RC?
Fluttercry BATMAN AND ROBIN SHALL NOT BE NAMED
fluttercry: oh
you want to see a bad Batman movie, go see Batman and Robin
01,11mitamaking: wait, so you're saying it's a BAD THING that he was so commited to giving the character the treatment he deserves?
Yeah, Eckhart's tas wasn't difficult...
DERPDERPDERPDERP: i love your name
*task
that movie was so bad it's entertaining
lol Deadlypon3
04If we ever show Batman and Robin I'm totally being Freeze
CrimsonPhoenix: Personally, I prefer the air! huehuehue
Silverscreen: After he died, yeah
sup Bruce
hehehe
:)
BRUCE WAYNE.
trolololol
Ghosties FREEZE WELL, GHOSTIES
flutter_spin, I hear nothing but good things about the Dark Knight trilogy (leftist whining about the last movie aside)
troll Bruce is trool
Though the Governator did a pretty...odd job, if hamfisted, way of portraying him in the live action movie.
Ghosties: "Cool" story bro!
flutter_spin: I don't know, they're still decent for their time, I just think times change, and movies change with them, don't they?
creativepony: Everything after Batman Returns, yea. I personally don't include the adam west Batman movie though, because it's an acquired tastes from that era
01,11trololol
harley quinn rocks
Ghosties is best Freeze
Keaton was such a weird chocie to play Batman, but it worked somehow
is catwoman in this?
CrimsonPhoenix: Well, I did mean as far as minor villains go. I always loved Batman's villains, they're all very... interesting.
04Aaaaand the puns begin
oni_link, and yet you use a landmaster....GENIUS
ohai ba... bruce
Hey, Ghosties? Do you now what killed the dinosaurs? DEE ICE AGE!
We don't want to start flame wars.

Good Guy Alfred

DERPDERPDERPDERP, I share the same feeling
Cool party

twilight_sprinkle: Thank you :)
FlootarShay: NO
Oh god no.

RaveBrony: Consarnit, man. Now I want pizza, but it's past 1 AM.
YES
Kandarihu: nono, the 'originals' like Batman, Batman Returns, Batman & Robin
I like both Alfreds.

Dat dress.

Silverscreen: I think Michael Caine, though he's a bit aut of character in TDKR.
Kandarihu: I feel the 'new' trilogy is on a completely different level
The Alfred in this movie tells Vicki Vruce's secret for no reason

We should make a "old" Batman movies marathon and stream Burton Batmans as A movies and Schumacher's as B movies:D
There's a camera!

Incoming song!? Unfortunately not. -_-

mitamaking really? "WHERE ARE THE DRUGS GOING!?"
01,11I liked the Nolanverse Alfred because of how he was much more involved, but I wish he didn't talk so damn much.
Bale is a good Batman when I can understand what he's saying.
with that GRUFFY VOICE?
cieling cat is watching you
Ghosties: Keaton? Like the fox?
/me uses Meanwhile s moustache cinderblocks on FlootarShay
There's a SPY AMONG US.

00,10so is it a BATdat?
Hey, uh, what are we watching? I forgot to check.
where's lucios fox? :<
Well realistically he WOULD have to disguise his voice as Batman
Silverscreen a long time ago, I was working for the local bandit who was a tangerine...
04Hello, Bat GEEK
Canadian_Brony: Batman
that recorder must have been the best thing you can get :)

Wirisme "SWEAR TO ME!"
Women's bathroom obviously not being watched <_< >_>
I don't think Fox existed at this point.
/me picks up Meanwhile by the hooves and hammers him against FlootarShay
Is this what Fox gave Batman in Dark Knight that got Fox mad?
He's Fabulous.
04The really fat guy is Gordon?
AJIsAwesome figured. Which one?
Shoot to kill. Always my favorite orders.
Running Waynetech LIKE A BAWS!
/me still unaffected
Wirisme: its not like voice masking is impossible especialy nowadays
He's got a tommy gun. Nice!
Ghosties Noooo
Taep... Cutting edge technology! :O
hey otakon
give it up stih
00,10Fatguy is the dective
Ghosties, nah
Its michief time
Silverscreen: Yeah too bad Alfred din't get too involved in these films until Schumacher
Wirisme: I can't keep from laughing when he's all "WHERE'S THE TRIGGERRRRRRR!" In Dark Knight Rises
Eyeup That's Gordon.
*sith
that fat guy is not gordon!
00,02MY INTERNET IS BACK :3

BOB!
"Batman"
I was watching some trailers
I haven't seen DKR yet
Phase4 BATMAN
01,11I liked Bales batman voice. It made perfect sense why he used it and it wasn't nearly as distracting as people made it out to be. I honestly didn't think anything of it until the internet was bashing it left and right.
I just realised I have not one, but three pictures of his 'stache lying around.
ohai Phase4, batman
Phase4: Batman 1989
GODDAMMIT
Ghosties: i think not. he's a duche
Phase4: Congrats. And it's Nicholson Batman
I didn't even know.

05,15Shark repellent
Phase4: Original "Batman" just started
nothing can stop otakon s wrath
/me was frozen today
bob
Also, one of those flying bugs with long legs just flew into my face, and now I can't stop laughing for some reason.
Late 90s batman
lol FREEZE!
adam west is incredibly overrated
>:3
good old acting
Chill out
If this were any other movie, there would have been a dozen explosions by nowl.
love the yay thingy :)
ikr Phase4... no adam west... :(
01,11Deadlypon3: He was a threat. He had to act like a threat.
Bronysith there is one thing
dem effects:D
otakon lags too much to be used effectively.
That's Gordon.
00,02fluttercry, Exactly, where is the batsprays
yay Gordon
04"Taken alive, see?"
05,15THAT IS NOT COMISSIONER GORDON
oh har har
GRODON FREEDMEN!
/me nomz otakon
man, gordon looks chubby as all hell
anti shark spray
04THAT IS NOT SOLID SNAKE!
fluttercry: totally.
Silverscreen "I"M NOT WEARING HOCKEY PADS"
/me licks and noms otakon repeatedly
Kammerjunk: I once knew a guy who ate those as a party trick.
Yeah, Oldman was a much better Gordon. This guy looks like Teddy Roosevelt
alive
00,10the voice buged me in bales number 2 and 3 movies Silverscreen
/me buries FlootarShay in alive in cement
here we go
00,10the first one was fine
i like the new gorden
Really weak Commisioner Gordon in this movie
Yeah for some reason we have big ol Pat Hingle as Gordon in all four of these films
ok ok harvey dent is balck and the comishoner is fat WUT
That's your opinon I respect that.
Meanwhile: wat
Clayface totally
holy cheeseburger batman
04Gary Oldman is the shit
ugh, buffer
/me breaks out of cementy tomb
Sumica: 3 Especially.
BATMAN.
O.o
And Batman
oh the classic gun sounds
.....there doomed
04"I'm Batman"
Burton's Gordon or Nolan's Gordon. Well, for me, the choice is obvious...
It makes sense to disguise his voice, but Bale over-did it.
sup Batman
well dent is brown in the animated series, no reason he can't be black in this
batspray!
NAM TAB!?
The Gordon in these movies was just there to have a Gordon
Batman to rescue
Ghosties Gary Oldman is best gary
YAY
but fat gordon is wierd
/me sets a tonberry next to FlootarShay
did batman, shoot him??
You cannot win
Railing k--wait, no.
00,10I used that move alot in the game
Sumica: that gravely voice is NOT made for yelling. It just isn't.
IDELUAAAA
epic entrance
No, he's hanging around.
and whats a tonberry
o..m..g
best reaction ever
oh my gaaaaawd
otakon: tell him
I love how awkward the batman move in this movie
"Oh My god"
My God.... It's Batman.
the tabloids were true!
oh my gooooooooooooood
Kind of like a dingleberry.
mother of god
01,11Deadlypon3: Voice recognition is easy to use to learn one's identity in the modern world, and choosing to disguise it proved to be a good thing when he electively became Public Enemy #1.
batman! everybody run!
WHEREARETHEDETENATORSRAMAOFM
RosePetal: Well I'm sure Batman thanks him for swinging in
ha Inverted take down
i remember when this originally came out
Sumica: me too, think i'm gonna play it after movies
Kandarihu: Ha! Joke on you! I have NO idea what that is!
Idiot
dem sound effects
whats a dingleberry
You missed!
Silverscreen it just doesn't sound imtimidating when he keeps YELLING IT OUT
Not the ooze! Quick! Save Roger Rabbit!
I dunno.
taht doesn't look healthy...
shogipony: Me, too.
pikoBat, from Batman TAS
people are really bad shots in this movie
04Fun fact: My mom met the man who played Comissioner Gordon in this film at a restaurant she worked at one time
00,10bat FACED
a tonberry is a little monster that kills you in 1 shot no matter how high your defense
flutter_spin: That was Dip
Silverscreen "SWEAR TO ME! WHERe are the DRUGS gooooin"
ouch

Well this came out in 1989.

fluttercry it's Ka-Too-Loo
00,02The_Bookworm, then what would be the point in the table?
They're already rebooting Batman for the Justice League film.

Well crap. I'm gonna use this Tab trick too!
FlootarShay: What about Adam West?
Because humans can't.

how surprising
man chat is rolling on by
Apparently not.
"Oh, the joker is downstairs, just FYI"
Bruce, who is laughing?
Another thing in this movie's favor is it handles Joker's origin very well.
Heath Ledger laugh is better
what is is Ghosties ?
00,02^ Haber
oh, right, not made post 90s
so this is where that scene is from
you have to wait 1 hour before Meanwhile goes DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAD
Ghosties: I just remembered how I got these scars!
we don't have to have several deaths before the first half hour
01,11fluttercry: I take it by the end of the movie, you figured out why.
You dont say?
she drunk
New Joker, as good as he was, wasn't the traditional Joker.
Yes
Docsane anything to do with jokers 'origon' is WRONG
00,02heath ledger or the guy from the adam west series, they are about equal imho

Enter, the JOKER
"Man, I know I'm drunk, but I can't even REMOTELY tell, that you're drunk."
You want to know how I got this mane, my father was a rock farmer:O
Mark Hamill is still best Joker
I need to know how to say yay
05,15Silverscreen I actually didn't hate it. It was NOWHERE near as good as the first one. But I didn't think it was THAT bad
that scene
Deadlypon3: The falling in the vat of chemicals is pretty much the only origin.
WENDY, IM HOOOOOOME!
It's okay Alfred has a bathrobe.
04Tossing a towel like a man without a care in the world
:|
ded old guy
"I wanna see you put a lampshade on your head or something!" "Sorry, bub!"
No, that's not Alfred.
DSNesmith, you are officially better at this 'posting' thing than otakon.
00,02Eli, you sure?
Phase4: Jack Nicholson is AMAZING too, I consider him Ledger tier, though Ledger was really at a whle new level, Nicholson was gof
hes joker
Docsane but Joker isn't a former MOB member!
Get READY.
one thing I liked about nolan's joker is that they kept his backstory ambiguous, like the comics
...
Deadlypon3: The only question is WHO exactly he was before he fell in.
The Killing Joke was pretty good
jokers first victim
00,02i remember seeing someone with your nick
god*
pony_300: weird?
fammit
Was there ever a continuity where Jack Napier was black and racist against white people, before falling in the chemicals, and becoming even whiter?
You gonna die
what's that supposed to mean?
"Why so serious, sugarbombs?"
DAMMIT
get ready to piss pants
GAH

*WOMAN
DAMN
01,11fluttercry: fair enough. I refuse to see it, I figured it wouldn't be nearly as good as the original. I guess I was right.
otakon: Just that you have a certain intimacy with the autokick.
dammit Meanwhile

Joker's wasting ammo!
and suddenl carmival music

DSNesmith: yeah, the Joker's origin is like a hyrda. As soon as you get one answer, it gives you 3 new questions.
I CANT SEE THIS IN NEW MOVIES NEW MOVIES SUCK ASS :)

This is pretty much what Tim Burton does on the weekends
that music fits perfectly, and that's freaking strange...

Hello Michael

01,11Fluttercy: They're not interesting because we don't know the characters. We don't know the characters because DC hasn't done other movies.
Truly, he is the world's greatest detective.
04He's Mr. Perfect
@fluttercry the Justice League cartoon was good though
if only it were like Arkham City when Batman went to the spot of his parent :'( that paino as batman pays his respects moved me
ok that mime couldn't be more conspicuos
We are surrounded by mimes.

fluttercry: better not be your first time seeing this
police! somebody! the joker just QUILLED someone!
And Bruce is just like "durrrrrr wut just happened"
05,15Sumica only bits and pieces
Bruce Wayne is not amused.
Looks like he's practicing his Keanu face
Uhm... Bruce, you don't have your bulletproof suit on
CK|GW2: :D
Lando is right behind them.

Now you have to go stealing another TV.
you could just turn the tv off....it'll save some money
Heavy should have one of those :D
you're dressed as a joker...
Again, reinforcing my belief that Bruce Wayne is kind of autistic in this movie.
04Looked more like Bruce was practicing his Mark Walberg face
enama
An enema.
RAHE

It's DC Universe.
....did he just say that?
also, that fist is very strong
05,15ewww

alfred the scientist
00,10yes he said that
classic
no
that was awesome
Yes because they will totally listen to you after you killed that guy Joker.
he's a former medic for the RAF IIRC though
Sounds like a blooper that Burton just wanted to throw in
"weight"
it's bruce's libido, alfred
woah
Yuck..........:S
lol
it's pretty stifling, I know
when does Bruce Wayne sleep?
This <X> needs an enema would be a good meme....hrm.
id narry her
OohShiny: sleep?
CK|GW2: no

Bruce Wayne never sleeps.
hah
OohShiny: That...is a very good question.
CK|GW2: too old
CK|GW2: Forced meme is forced?
wat
OohShiny: I don't think he does.
OohShiny: On thursdays
OohShiny, I've been asking that question before
05,15This chat needs an enema.....no that doesn't work
This cancer is an enema
bruce wayne pays people to pay for him

01,11creativeponyname: you don't want to know.
hi
CreativePonyName: Do you really not know?
you all need an enema, now hush
I mean, anyone he didn't directly coerce into it
AJIsAwesome: You just need the proper leverage to make them work, is all.
CreativePonyName: use google images>_><_<
otakon: You want an enema?
CreativePonyName, its where doctors shove a tube up your rear and fluch it out
CreativePonyName: It's like an enemy, but more a-ish
"I going to give you an lead enema", maybe
FlootarShay: It's the only name he could remember.
I need an Alfred butler
inb4 enema is a Bronystate meme
What have you started?!
this channel needs an enema
0H G0D
CreativePonyName: If you have a strong stomach

Dat whistle.
01,11He puts a smile on every face.

awww he's doing a collage
You have five still photos of him with a trenchcoat and shades, that's not really helping you accomplish much.
Silverscreen: hes pinkie pie?
I wonder if Pinkamena can be Joker
Who knew Joker was very artistic.

"When we last fought, I broke the bat. Tonight, I break the man."

*Lab
05,15Nobody cared who was until I put on the mask

01,11inb4 laughing.
04No, I was talking about Vicki Vale
ah yes. this part
lol Action news.

Lol. So much to DO and so little time.

we're gonna take them out a whole new door....? WAT
Ghosties: Oh. My mistake.

Action News, for when your news isn't boring enough

That's a stripper name if I ever heard one.

SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
lool
TERRORISM
This creeped the fuck out of me when i was a kid
Love that Joker
now i get where Joker's omniescient timing ability in the cartoon came from; this movie.
love that joker!
a happy face
This is what the Joker would do in the animated series.
before it was the main thing
05,15damn you ninja'd me
"Cause I love to make you smile, smile, smile! ę
dat post
Lol dat terrorism. Wait, terrorism isn't funny ._.
When all the newfoals in main are banned, you have my permission to die
Doughnuts and Tea... life is good.
The Batman is not pleased.
:D
For those of you who miss the camp of the Comics Code Batman, here it is.
Best trolling ever
RosePetal: eeyup, but with fish
lol
Except he wouldnt kill people.
Hoo boy.
Glad that we could turn that off :p
This is what the Joker would do in the comics.
joker is best troll
am I the only one laughing at ded people?
Ya know, it's hard to take this guy entirely seriously as a villain.
Best way to do a bane voice is to talk like Sean Connery into a glass mug
That's true.
05,15I'm Bronystate's reckoning
When the Thunder Badge is earned, you have my permission to Fly
Terrorism is causing fear. Joker causes laughter. I don't even anymore.
art
Deadly troll is best troll?
Fisheh_Fish: This was the 80s, back before terrorism got all serious
/me puts a moth in Randomnerd s tea
goddamit
That's because he's the Joker.
STOPT HAT
01,11"Highly intelligent, emotionally unstable"
shopping
joker's scarier when he's not intelligent... or at least, when you can't be sure
wait who hates moths again?
shopping ^^
<otakon> goddamit
shopping montage!
01,11The profile of 95% of Batman's Rogue Gallery
Midnight_Fyre: I see. So terrorism used to have a comedic aspect to it?
so... Rarity?
shopping for meth
spinning newspapers!
otakon: Hey, don't hate on TF2.
Petrified_Discord: im lost too
Hats are cool.
DSNesmith: but that's the thing, the Joker is a mad genius
Interesting problem with assholes on the internet... Where does one's right to speak conflict with one's right to not have to hear it?
Hwat.
Dat mole on his face.
zit?
00,10she looks like she has never smiled
lol
hwat
well it's fun to have him be really smart underneath the crazy
EW! HER FACE!
Pony toys
nice hair
I tell you hwat!
No beauty or hygeine products used
man, those two already look dead
dam, they ugly
Her hair
> No makeup, Hahahaha
Apparently lack of beauty products prevents them from brushing their damn hair.
she looks like she has a bad hair day
except for Billy Dee Williams
HOy Lando
I guess that woman is Kristen Stewarts's inspiration. :D
he's cunning, but his schtick isn't intelligence
lol, i see why he put it in makeup products
AlienWarhead: Oh noo! D:
his pomade is unaffected
Terrorism is trying to affect political change with the credible threat of violence. This isn't really what the Joker is doing.
that lady LOOKED LIKE CRAP
And Lando
Lando's talkin to Vader
00,10it's because they were not useing any thing that might have the smilex in it
It's Kristen Stewarts Mother.
the blue button!
01,11Why does Dent's office look like the President's office...?
00,10so they look like shit
icky with a V
mmm, I love that word. schtick, schtick
Sumica: no no,not smilex smiley
tomlpchan: ahhhhhh, now I get it!
I found a really interesting article about that. I was thunderstruck by the first assertion about geeks... "Ostracizers are evil".
comming from him that meant alot
Silverscreen: no idea
Dat sweater.
Tovler: dat Fairly Oddparents ref
yay
lol
dat makeup

It's Hexadecimal!
oh gawd!
OpticalPie, no
daddys going to make some art
00,10more big lip moments
makeup is srs buisness
D:
ummm...makeup on makeup?
The idea being that nerds are scared to tell someone off because they conflate it with bullying.
wait so is his face white
okay that is creepy
Joker is now fabulous!!!
Dat zombie
yikes
That mask looks safe
Daddy, don't you mean Mr. J?
....Hawwwwt
ART!
Wait.
01,11The thing is, everyone's starting to look like sh*t because they refuse to use ANYTHING out of fear of Smilex being in it.
dat music <3
Dark Knight's Joker's motivation seemed to be to spread anarchy and chaos, while this Joker's motivation seems like it IS anarchy and chaos
or they're just beta
That's silly.
ha. Mr. J :P
that was creepier than Jokers.
DB_Brony: more like makeup over disfigured face
Btw: She's not Harley
The Joker doesn't wear make-up
i almost lost my sandvich
00,10yeah his face is permentatly white from the acid
AJIsAwesome: No one is fabulous until Rarity gets done with them.
THAT WASN'T A, y'know, I'm not even gonna try anymore.
I love that pointless horror music they played to enhance that scene. Weird touch
whoooaaaa, take it eeasy on the cake baatter
Silverscreen: SMILEY
But then again, my entire class consists purely of nerds. So we all just yell at each other.
Everlasting_Joy: True. :D
Especially about browsers and OS.
also the idea of a nerd being afraid of telling someone off
oh the museum scene is great
is hilarious
I bet that he was actually taking the makeup OFF in that shot
Everlasting_Joy: So very true.
I feel classy just by listening to this.
dat Mozart
this scene is another classic
01,11Clayface: way to rip from Nostalgia Critic without giving him credit.
otakon: you say tomato, I say tomato....wait...
Yes, his skin is permantly white so he's using fleshy makeup.
who was the best captain
Silverscreen its not like they buy makeup from the next town or something
DB_Brony: lol doesn't work on chat
Tovler: I'd better put on my spare monacle!
/me yawns.
aww
This is why it is good to buy products imported from Chinese sweatshops instead of domestic brands
You've never had a "friend" you couldn't drive off?
Where is my date? He's late!
kirk
DB_Brony: doestn work online :D
forever alone
Silverscreen, good point. I guess what the Joker did DOES fit what I defined as terrorism.
funny joke
but seriously
05,15Oh snap Silverscreen doesn't let anything fly
04Green and purple, eh?
JUST ARRIVED

A Big Lipped Alligator Moment is when something completely rando-

He's breaking into an art museum to destroy the art? Um, why? For shits and giggles? o.o

it must be fun working for joker once in a while
Eli "Batman: Dark Knight"
CK|GW2: Uh, DUH?
Why does one have a candelabra? 6_9
CK|GW2: He IS crazy
Some people want to watch the world burn. Joker wants to cover everything in paint
well its official. joker is best villan
04...I like that one too
Sheesh, Joker's got more swag than TM87. :D
zombies!
Cuz he's the Joker he does what he wants.
spooky
wait....did the joker bring a boombox otherwise he'd just be dancing without any music
wow
CK|GW2, he is the joker. he does everything for the shits and giggles
Why put on the makeup if nobody will see you
01,11Not really a BLAM considering that it lead to Joker meeting Vicki and Batman's confrontation with him.
reminds me of RUN DMC

That's not scary. It's not that bad.
flutter_spin: enope, who is voiced by...TARA STRONG

Well that was underwhelming
04Ohhhh, so Joker's method is the latest philosophy of the avant-garde (which is basically murder as art, not unlike Cohen from Bioshock)
shes the shredder
What was on her face
DocSane: it's that HE did it
oh shit
In one issue of "Birds of Prey", the Goons tried to form a union.
That's really not that bad.
Harley would be all happy go lucky and call the Joker Mister J

fluttercry: my mic doesnt take in the vibrations from the cup very well... it just sounds like me doing a bad Sean Connery immitation
I mean, Nicholson's Joker is straight from the comic. Ledger's was an entirely new and scary reinterpretation.
05,15nanananananananana BATMAN
Batman could have kiled the joker right there and saved countless peple, but he didn't. Batman needs to work on his priorities
Yes. Batmobile is awesome.
I think I saw Marty McFly again.
CrimsonPhoenix: it's god though
RosePetal: Night! :)
I'm back!
Forever be "the" batmobile
01,11I'm not going to lie, I fucking love this car more than Nolan's tank.

I just don't remember much of it though
everyone hates the nolan tank
LOl chase scene.
00,10and yes this is way better then the tumbler
Silverscreen: me too, didn't like the new batmobile...the batwing however :) me gusta
Wb Joy
I agree, the Battank just wasn't as cool.
I still have a micromachine Batmobile and Joker Van :)
one thing I really like about joker is that he does everything by proxy
Derp
Kandarihu: i know
Mythbusters tried that. It didn't work
MY CABBAGES!!!!
KnifeH?
and his proxies are just common street trash
Too oped

Batmobile needs to have Batman's face on it.'
The batCycle was cool
JESmith71: I know, and I'm pointing out why it is a stupid rule
Are you there?
MY CABBAGES!@
I don't hate the Nolan tank. It's not iconic but definitely more practical, so it fit that world.
Canadian_Brony: Beat me to the punch
Best Batmobile right there
my cabagges!
Bad pileup
01,11To be fair, though, the Tumbler made more sense in how it was able to function like a military vehicle.
got 100000 points in burnout
RosePetal: lol
DERPDERPDERPDERP: it was pretty awesome in it's own right but the original Batmobile is where it's at
he manages to make random thugs into something genuinely scary

Conroy is also best Batman.
04Conroy voiced Batman in The Animated Series, so yeah
05,15What would Japanese Batman be like?
That's a shitty parking spot
Ghosties: Agreed.

the batcave
No really, look at that!
bats, bats everywere
04Yep yep, ota
fluttercry: Roger Smith, from Big O.
Conroy, Keaton and Bale are best Batmans.
Ghosties: No arguments there.
I'm going to put ledger's joker slightly above hamill's, because he wasn't restricted by the "kid's show" label
The Batcave needs more railings
The Animated series is best Batman overall?
BATMANNU
What if he drove just a little too far?
Ace Ventura would crap himself if he saw all those bats
04And, of course, Hamil voiced Joker in the Arkham games too
Clooney was pretty good
Not unlike
His insurance agents must HATE this place
meh. I like the gnatcave more.
and best joker was mark hamill
Sumica: Maybe it's the Screwloose of the bat cave.

Silver: DAFUQ :)
Except that it's the first time he's said that in the whole movie despite killing countless people
The end.

And what if he was shot in the head?
Do it
00,10the internet of olden times
Then... he wud be ded
Because a tin plate one millimeter thick will stop nothing except maybe a bb-gun round.
She looks like Harley Quinn.
So many names with the same amount of characters.
It's messing with my head.
They only mention his father
DERPDERPDERPDERP: That would imply that the villain wasn't a bloody idiot
dat modern tech
I remember using microfilm.
Giant glasses!
Cute Bruce Wayne.
:'(
whatis this witchcraft?

00,10well it was like a .22 he was shot with
04Let's get physical, physical
Don't get mercicle? what

lol
CK|GW2: True, true.
00,10might as well be a BB gun
01,11Telling a woman not to get personal? Silly Nox...
Guys for the last time Harley is NOWHERE in this movie nor in the sequels
AXIS chemicals? Not ACE chemicals?
alfred!
It causes them to want to train and beat up criminals for the rest of their lives.
Derp: Lukcy for wayne the joker doesn't know about doubletapping either
05,15Okay, we can't get personal. But can we get dangerous?
I want to see a version of batman
Yeah they replace Chill with Joker in this one.
Thats what it causes to children
where alfred is played by alfred molina
hey I'm back
Can we get nuts?
Let's get dangerous.
Walnuts, preferably.
Also, YOU SEE? This is why you fucking double tap.
Nyst: There was probably a real Ace Chemicals
this sound familiar?
00,10do we realy need a valt for the costume?
alfred is best butler
Let's get Walnuts?!
I cannot think of a worse person for the role
the batsafe
except maybe jack black
00,10I meen the secret cave is't enough?
like a baws
01,11Sorry, but that line was ten times better than the long speech Cain gave.
05,15wasn't he Doctor Octopus?
if Alfred dies, I'm gonna cry, seriously
Do you wanna get Wallnuts! Come on let's get Walnuts!
Alfred as played by Jack Black?
yeah
Is everyone this dumb? It's very simple. You always, always, ALWAYS double tap the enemy.
is it time? is it... yes YES
Sumica double protection

He broke the forth wall.

Seems legit.
I remember that fluttercry.
he can act really well when he's not typecast
rough?
this is The! Worst! Possible! THING!
he's actually breaking the 4th wall
which is... 95% of the time
I was so thirsty I just drank a 16 oz bottle of gatorade in less than 5 seconds
05,15DSNesmith I know right! I actually really liked him. It surprised me
Early night Shizu?

And yet he's wearing make-up as he said that
13wut
Sumica: isn't that from robin hood?
00,10he has Bat Tivo
Does Bruce Wayne always have to look so fricking bland?
Is it just me, or does he look like Spengler with his glasses on?
what I didn't like in this movie is pretty much Joker's Origin
Wait, 7:32? I thought you were in Germany.
AD Blocker activate!
Shizuka: i need your pyro skills, please set fire to these stupid children
Hmmmmmm.
s parents
00,10yeah Eli

Bronysith it's because Bjornfot has strange fetishes
I DO WANT I WANT.
RosePetal: That became a running joke in the adam west Batman show

WHAT HAS SEEN CANNOT BE UNSEEN

XD
but JESmith71, thats the best part of the whole suit.
She's got a point tbh.
Shizuka: I do, and I must say I prefer my loose pants with pockets.
Hey now, there was that fat corrupt cop, and Gordon who hasn't done anything, and then there was also
So would that gun be called a "Batling Gun"?
dem armor
Large pockets, at any rate.
let's shoot the car at close range
i just imagined Meanwhile in tights with his rape face
ded
Lol they are going to waste their bullets.
This Batman kills.
hoom
bullets don't ricochet, right
kaboom
01,11Boom
Batman doesn't use guns, just high explosives
boom*
bullshit
o_o
CK|GW2:....good point

kaboom!
BOOM.
00,10*plink* BOOOOOOOOM
kablewn!
Trollmobile
oh shit\
boom!
batdroppings
Looney Tunes?
yeah, no killing
And Batman murders them in cold blood.
needs moar wilhelm
When you've got a chance, try tights.
damn, batman just killed like fifty people
DSNesmith: They do now.
did batman just kill a bitch
XD
Bronysith now sketch it and show us all :)
/me the music says: I'm gonna kick your ass...........
ow my balls
so I'll ask again, as the batman games been streamed here?
an he bat mobile makes it outhow?
Batman means Buisness!
It was his car that killed them
NoImBatman: i cant draw, ask wrek
dayummm
RainbowGuy: High explosives?
WTF BOOOOOOOOOOM
did batman just kill some people?!
I thought he didnt kill
I'm back
00,10it's not cold blood if they are armed DocSane
micheal bay directed that part
what I miss?
05,15I dunno, I think it would feel weird to wear tights
Did he just seriously blow them up in a Looney Tunes style bomb drop?
I'm they are all sleeping..... in the fire
Batman's all like "brb gotta blow up a castle for no reason"
but batman cant kill!
He did kill at first
fluttercry: i think it would be kewl
Also, did Batman just seriously murder those guys?
lol batman killed pepole
13pockets are good, i've found jeans are usually too well fit to actually use the pockets... is why i usually wear a light jacket
latex tights
"Good car."
well warner owns dc
Ryunosuke: I knew a Michael Bay joke would come up
tights would be painfully restrictive
Ryunosuke: that was the signal of Bay's birth
if it's just the batmobile on auto pilot, then he may not have been sure of people inside
My ex rarely wore tights. But i liked it when she did :D
a kilt is more my style
See, he wasn't in the car
"I'm not going to kill you. But I don't have to save you from this bomb i'm dropping off either."
Someone said he did in the earlier comics? No his car did.
BladedWings: MORE like The Joker's minions
It's the second one when he really starts killing people
Sumica: It is if there is no risk to anyone else
00,10and he did't kill, the car did >_>
:c
i just fucking freeball all day long

BladedWings: and THE BAT-MOBILE KILLED them.......was it?

DSNesmith: Utilikilt?
01,11That's when everyone with a fear of clowns had a heart attack.
I love Joker's gang. They look so happy.
Joker likes his pop music
00,10would you call factory puting out deadly toxens no risk Spazturtle?

Wow, this is the lamest parade ever
Dats right dance with the Joker.

JOOOOOOOOOOOKER!
I've actually never worn a kilt
these moments make me say WTF even to this day
he was controlling the car, so he killed them
they look comfy though
There's one float and like twenty or thirty people there
....
Does not matter they want their moneh.
Dark92Enigma: by batman's orders/commands
dat Party
words fail me at this scene.
joker got swag
you dont wear underpants
You need to buy bigger jeans Shizu.
when wearing a kilt
...
it is tradition
Seems totally legit
lol Get your moneh.
Seriously, I have no words for this.
DSNesmith: Well, considering you are wearing nothing underneath . . .
slap the cuffs on the batmobile!
where's the police? :/
Bronysith: Right-o.
Ive worn a kilt. Not horrible, but.... I dont like anything short.
Meanwhile: she wouldn't fit in bigger jeans
twilight_sprinkle BladedWings point taken
Silverscreen: Don't worry, one clown in particular has a fear of bats, and men!3
i hope that money explodes
let me guess the money is fake
It's rainin' money!
that is why otakon is now imagining Thane in a kilt
free money free money, everyone freeee money!
well as long as it's not rough wool or anything
You'd think there'd be a cop or two or something...
The police are lazy today.
Yep, Joker is Pinkamena in that movie
I'd like a kilt actually
otakon: That's what belts are for.
RainbowGuy: sorry, high explosives refer to detonation not burning... I didn't see how you'd tell
DOSH
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE MONEY
a long kilt anyway
Inb4 The Police want money too.
He sure is having a good time

RAWRity: o_o

13the pockets want to follow the line with the rest of the fabric on jeans, so the interior can only expand inwards
inb4 the balloon pops and releases gas? if that is what happens then joker is way too predictable
RAWRity: i need bleach
MY EYES!

inb4
Sumica sorry.....tried to post my ''lyrics'' to Batman's theme tune
"they will go out with a smile Literally!" ~ main chat
04Wouldn't it be better to bribe Gotham and get the citizens on his side instead of...I dunno...killing them?
I only used a backpack when I went to school.
get dafaq out crazy ho!
such as papers, pencils, supplies, fellow students
You're taking pictures when you could be running. :|

I'm so surprised!
no! (gets in car)
Oh no, The guy who is insane is actually killing people! RUN FOR IT!

then wait for a little kid to jump into the fire shouting "Diagon alley!"
I still haven't heard a wilhelm scream in this movie. I am disappointed.
Dat clown smiles at your misfortune.
it holds up the best to multiple viewings

it's a movie about horrible people doing stupid things
Does it also extend to occasional bouts of speaking in the third person?
CK|GW2: You can shoot any plane down with a gun
but it's intentional
all that, from a pistol
bulletproof plane blows like paper?
Shizuka: it's basically if the Nazi's won and then fought aliens
He dissapeared again.
The Batwing wasn't made well
I CAN'T DIE......I'M BATMAN
Great. Now this has me thinking of that dumb joke.
I can't die i'm the protagonist!
