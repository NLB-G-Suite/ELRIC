It bumped over a candle and set its tail alight. It was fine though.
i never really played raids... it's totally boring after the first time...
intellect no longer increases mana?
pvp and that's that
i know my cousin said something about fixed mana
but that's bullshit
Intellect, didn't they remove that?
its fixed at 200k at 90, 100k at 85
the real gameplay is the pvp

rogues
lawl
Does anyone else think LFR is utter crap?
I have 102K mana
i've had plenty of good runs
Hello everypony. :)
Hi everyone! :)

Uh oh. MMO topic.
/me hides.
I can never unsee Raggies legs.
hello kitty island adventure
/me hides to since he can't join in
Sometimes when I close my eyes they're just...there.
I have never done a heroic raid except ICC
private*
I also never did a raid til Level 80
movie night starts at 7pm there and 1 am here, annoying
Aye, but Ulduar is still the best raid that ever came out.
I shall stay up for it
Best. Raid. Ever
Herald of the Titans is still my favourite title.
They freaking destroyed the Mimridon head mount drop
its now 1%
100%
:o
Aye, because now you can farm Yogg+0
With idiots no less.
Well to be fair it would be too easy now
I like my 'Loremaster' title... but its not much...
probably 2 mannable in mists, itll cease to be rare soon
Uphill!
Nothing is more hilarious then unintentionaly getting a Raid achivement
*days
Last time I checked AV doesn't last five minutes.

Stopped playing WoW months ago. Still has the same old problems.
I have officially stopped playing with MoP
:\
I'm playing The House 2... I'm in the bathroom...
Yep yep
the last MMO to really impress me and give me the "Morning already?" feeling was Rift
Even though Deathwing has been defeated, they still havent repaired Stormwind
Lazy workers
Rift sucked
i quit in the living room, fucking girl coming out of no where scared the crap out of me
the ONLY reason why i wanted MoP was to FINALLY murder Garrosh.... but :(
gamon for warchief
Oh Algalon the raid destroyer..the memories
*Alagon
I remember when Garrosh was just a whiny bitch in Nagrand.
I like Thrall
Now he's a whiny bitch with bigorexia and he's stolen Org.
Anyone streaming?
Lol

Oh C'Thun.....What A Boss!! :D

A: is the floppy disk drive
Come Every Dri-ive, LOAD LOAD LOAD! Fill my buffer up with DA-TA DA-TA!
ahh, that answers that
bye everyone!!!
13A: is just the label typically assigned to the floppy disk drive, on account of it generally being the first available drive to boot from on early systems
I used to use 5.25 disks
and by old, i mean 20
I actually, predate 5.25's
:)
I'm from the audio tape era
00,10well it's gone on my end
aye
i got little freezes here and there but its cool
Because I remember those as well.
13might have changed
But eight-tracks are before my time.
Gonna take a shower, brb
And just to be clear, I'm referring to cassettes being for computer software
\m/
yeah, but i haven't seen a program in ages that actually assumes the D: was CD
Metal + ponies: AWESOME

00,10I even have a P: drive
*specifically
and besides, it was $20 on a $2200 system

Right. I'll be busy with something else.

Vote moustache.
Oh

Guys is this the film with penguin????
I wish the media would have stayed like how it was in the 90s but with the technical advancements we have now :/
no
hmmmm
though really, A sack of heated shit>>>>>>>clooney
this one
Jack Nicholson is god's best friend
agreed
05,15DashWithRainbows yes. that's him. he's also Lando from Star Wars
You look fab
ouch
This guy's good, but Ledger was another level.
That gotta burn
Dat tie.
BURN
Damn. He's. COOL.
whats this?
Ledger sells crazy psychopath
Gnight, regs.
"Ooaah wwoahahah"
Yeah he did a great job, but you know, Ledgers gonna Ledge.
05,15Ledger made him seem real. Nicholson plays him like a comic book
BULLOCK!
lol
05,15Both are great in their own way
It's Commisor Gordon!
where's gordon?
:)
Actually, I wish the media could be like it is in every fiction where the media doesn't play a role.
like a bat? probably superman
bullock
Bats
lol
yummy draino
dat voice
Okay.

Bullock is best pony.
IT'S HIM!
Nice hat
and AN is the keyword
Dat hat.
hi there
dat mafia
shaad aap
hey, you LISTEN!
Dat corruption
HArveh Dent?
Its only in my opinion
Harvvvvey Dent.
Are those ponies on the botton of the screen?
Back when everyone must wear a hat
Dent's in this movie
that's right
Eyeup.
that is not harvey dent
Amber: Yep.
JACk
Jaaack.
ha, jack
:)
And his japanese equivalent, Halvey Dentu
yeah, Jack.
Amber: Indubitably. Tis a sacred tradition for movie night
Damn dirty cops.
There he is.
Whooo, smooth today :D
1.Hamill 2.Romero 3. Nicholos 4.Ledger
DAMN DIRTY APES
BANG
04OKAY
that laugh
04Now, maybe that'll work
01,11mitamaking: you put ledger behind Romero...?
I'm thinking 20-30 minutes.
Aw, Rainbow Dash looks cute with her wings out! :)
Problem with Nicholson is that he's just playing the usual Jack Nicholson character.
Twerlet_Sperkle: later
I'm fine with that
There is Harvey suave Dent
Haha. Ceasar Romero.
LANDO ?!
Gotham City looks scary. ;_;
04Dude, isn't that...what's his name
TDK was the only movie I've seen twice in theaters
mainly for ledger
05,15Ledger and Nicholson are both fantastic. Nicholson plays him like a comic character, and Ledger plays him as a real psychopath
oh
04Damn...Carl Winslow?
that one
TDKR was... okay
05,15I don't think you can really compare them
Didn't watch.
Hi, everypony!

Vicki.... bleh
04*Harvey
It's Vicki.
for one thing it pulled a complete 180 on the themes of the last two movies
I honestly don't get that.
"See? Pictures by VICI VALE!"
04Lando...like, Lando from Star Wars?
she likes bats
*subtle hint*
for another, the plot was recycled and the motivations made no sense
01,11Hamil, Ledger, Nicholson.
I like trains!
"I really like her mane!"
i liek bats
buffer
i g2g guyz cya
also, bane's voice
I like pie
yes
04Ohhhh
I guess shes gonna be Bat GIrl
YEs
well
No, stay away from Gotham City because usually you end up as a hostage or a villian.
before we start
Wow, 255 people here......:O
anyone afraid of spoilers?
He's Harvuy Dent
Is Sumerman best friend Bamtan?
01,11Though Hamil and Ledger, IMO, are on the same level.

05,15NO SPOILRES
damn buffer
no
Hello everypony!
04Huh
lol
Nope.avi
Yes.

Jabby Jabby.

which is... 95% of the time
05,15DSNesmith I know right! I actually really liked him. It surprised me
00,10joker was always great when it came to embracing the media
Teeth: I'm lying through them.

13>7:32pm

And yet he's wearing make-up as he said that
I watched this subtitled in Costa Rica last week. They subtitled "mano y mano" as "me y tu"

Yeah we get it kids are shit
"It's something I have to do." Uh, no it's not. There are cops in this city and they haven't done ANYTHING all movie.
Well, I'm starting to dooze off, time for another enrr
How about using them? XD
energy drink*
<3 boys
That's why he has to do it
Literally, I don't care, at all, and neither does anyone else really.
and people are wondering why their kids get molestered
Sudden awkward romance.
that came out wrong
Let's face it, The cops don't do anything in the Gotham at all.
batsuit!
I'm wondering why you're still talking.
>mfw no bat nipples
They try but they fail.
EPIC MUSIC INCOMING
no batass?
That is an excellent reveal.
I have no chin.
Speak for yourself, I've worn tights.
Incomptence, thy name is Gotham Police Force.
At least they didn't show the batass

an he bat mobile makes it outhow?
dayummm
WTF BOOOOOOOOOOM
I thought he didnt kill
I'm back
05,15I dunno, I think it would feel weird to wear tights
Did he just seriously blow them up in a Looney Tunes style bomb drop?
Batman's all like "brb gotta blow up a castle for no reason"
He did kill at first
13pockets are good, i've found jeans are usually too well fit to actually use the pockets... is why i usually wear a light jacket
latex tights
"Good car."
tights would be painfully restrictive
Corvette Batmobile is best Batmobile
if it's just the batmobile on auto pilot, then he may not have been sure of people inside
My ex rarely wore tights. But i liked it when she did :D
a kilt is more my style
It's the second one when he really starts killing people
i just fucking freeball all day long
04...
Oh damn

Seems totally legit
Seriously, I have no words for this.
slap the cuffs on the batmobile!
where's the police? :/
i hope that money explodes
It's rainin' money!
free money free money, everyone freeee money!
well as long as it's not rough wool or anything
You'd think there'd be a cop or two or something...
The police are lazy today.
I'd like a kilt actually
DOSH
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE MONEY

Inb4 The Police want money too.
