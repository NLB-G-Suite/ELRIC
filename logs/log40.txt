The moment it became Gyarados, I taught it epic moves using reusable TMs
People shouldn't battle others with hacked Pokémon
I mean, I don't mind hacking them for fun
7And actually, it's faster.
but as soon as you battle, don't use it
7It has a Naive nature.
4lol
4Toph

k
12*states
12w/e
04:|
04I can guarentee
if you have someone on ignore, act like they don't exist and don't talk about them in the open
12more like annoys
which is a retarded rule
12that works
12but
12isn't it ultimately up to higher authority?
It is possible, though if he does, he won't have all day like he usually does when he's home
If someone has ignored you, why not ignore them back?
12to allow that
04"DRF? Who's that?"
er
talking about me
04nice fix
drf, you arent the leader of this channel
:P
I'm a mod
4........................
mods can edit rules
exactly
04[21:28:10] <prince-dari> If someone has ignored you, why not ignore them back?
04erm
04nvm
because I don't use ignore
12ok
12drf
04misread dari
04okay then
12i think we should have rules to a mod vote
I am following my own rule
04SUCK IT UP
12make a rule that talking is not allowed anymore on #sw
then learn to ignore manualy
:P
12see how that hold up
Its THAT simple
7Lol.
>_>
04^
04:3
12it's not fair for one mod alone to make rules as he/she pleases
04hi Ecco
you're telling me to ignore the entire channel
04Leave now
12that'd be like me saying
04if you want to be sane
04yes it is
7O_o
Haha, I am male, yeah.
04lol Bree
04Lotta channels has that
wtf autocorrect
04heh
04Roara it was
Everyone
12i'm on the fence about it
04you have bad timing
04:/
just shun the non-believer
4no
4someone had emonga
12for starters drf
-,-
12eXAKR
12butt out
4wnated waruvial

12your reason for making the rule is based off something really personal
4emonga isn't in krookodile's place!!!!!!!!!!!!
what'
/me noms Ecco
12but got told off by everyone for it being such a personal situation
wel
Jwell
**
Kipi left anyway
12yet i resisted and just sucked itu p
yes I do
you told me
/me eats popcorn.
04XD

04That's why you're awesome
/me 7blinks.
04:P
XD
04AMong other reasons
/me high-fives back.
/me brofists
04:P
/me 7sneaks in another bag of popcorn.
the concept of talking about someone because you know they can't reply is incredibly rude
/me eats out of Quanyails' bag of popcorn
IMHO
04:3
7o3o
12drf is this the first time you heard of gossiping?
04he's informing other people to ignore someone if they're pissing them off
its opinion
04which is understandable
4alright
12while I agree with you
which you carry out way too far
4i know i'm not crazy
12still
6it's been said before, both sides are out of line here
04k um
4SOMEHOW THE FREAKING EMOLGA DISAPPEARED!!!!!!!!!!!!

12i thought it was 10%
4..........................................................................
1210 to 20%
04and drf
it might be LOL
7GTS trades are different than wi-fi trades.
but it's not 100
04the second half is involuntary
/me 4faints

/me RUNS
not really
04yes
4hehehehehehe. thanks

This is most joyous news. We must celebrate.
If we set out at once, we shall arrive within a fortnight, shall we venture forth?
yes

I don't even care about drf anymore
12don't even think about the other
2HEY!

O.O
The cards I got were Blitzle and Pidove
12o-O
03I hope "a forum" isn't TST forum
For one, it wouldn't make any difference it was, note I said a "pony spam topic", IE a topic for spamming ponies, in the spam section of a forum.
I don't use the TST forum anyway.
if it was*
03*stop
Wet have plenty lol

03forum games... are basically spam yeah but at least there's a point to thpem
03well
03there's supposedly a point
03I don't see one but yeah
and of course
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/res/151556.html

LOL
12o.o
+s

Huh. i hope they have a wonderful time getting raped in jail.
<drf|laptop> hacking government sites < how do you hack gov. sites
?
nah they arent
they're just idiots
<SilverSonic> Huh. i hope they have a wonderful time getting raped in jail. wouldn't they turn into b******?
They replaced a site with nyan cat. 500 points for that.
wow
03<Damos> hacking government sites < how do you hack gov. sites <- very carefully
03I'm not saying *I* know how to but people have done it
you've done it
I can feel the timing
between each sentence from that
03no
I could feel it
^
No, They dont
12lolz
03yes they do
03SilverSonic

Just EWWWWWWWWWWWWW MADDEN GAMES
03prince-dari, something about DRM in their software
Oh.
03I pretty much refuse to buy anything with DRM
03on concept
03the exception is videos on iTunes, and that's only because I have a decrypter
03SilverSonic I agree
03both soccer and football are incredibly overrated :P
03yeah some guys are too into it
I don't like either over the other, I just don't get why American football is called "football" in America, when there's hardly any kicking of the ball.
03Microsoft doesn't make games
03more or less
lol my aunt talks to the TV when her favorite player is on the field

FSX
03they made Hexic, that was about it
Ship SImulator

NUUUUUU

This one scared me.
*silence*
As long as Spike, Rarity, and Fluttershy still remain uncorrupted we still have hope
D:
You think they haven't been corrupted yet?
Oh you poor souls.
(:<
poor?
/me collides Manhatan with Manehattan
I'd rather remain thinking they're good characters
Manehatan.
I feel like Aura24 is just looking for fights now
yeah
Aww.
bringing "haters" into every single thread
I'm really glad she's not a mod, despite how many people seem to want her to be
she takes everything too seriously
she'd be a terrible mod imo
An alternative manhattan where there's ponies and copper-coloured Statue of Liberty
yeah
way too biased
Watch this - does it scare you?
03sounds like Watchmen
...D:
I imagine she'd edit other people's posts too when she edits her own

I always used to have to tell him off for spam and saying dumb things
12thats if
only stopped because he hasn't been doing it lately
Screw it then XD
X3
that was the point I was trying to make with my post though, is that you don't hate her and she was overreacting by starting arguments where they don't need to be
Yeah
but you can't expect her to understand that
now we're both probably on her "haters" list
Another one.
it'll take a while to load for me
15 minutes long

ESPEON IS THE WORST EEVEELUTION!!!1
04Nope

04WHY
oh yeah sega
04oh
04well for THAT that was awesome
04k
03Chimera, finally we agree in our dislikes XD
They even offered advice or support apparently.
03then I told her about rootkits
03and she was like WHY
03and I was like exactly, this is why I hate them
04I don't like Lulzse
04c
03exactly.
6and?
6I don't see the point here
12I can't remember where I put my passport
/me attempts to go find it
03and the fact that PSN was down for like a month
04Drf
03I'm like
04they admitted it because they're pretentious.
04"OH LOOK WE HAXX'D SONY"
04As awesome as that was
04"OH LOOK WE HACKED *company*" is just stupid
03in which case it's awesome.
03hm
03I'm trying to buy computer parts as a gift for someone

03I posted this here the other day
03saying you would be mad
03:P
03though LOL
03only 1.29 million people used Sega's website?
03that's kinda sad given how many people are on the planet
hello
Just letting you guys know I'm still here
03Seriously, I just don't care.
07your point?
6that's how he is for everything just ignore it
07exactly lol
6which is everything
6@HML
03not really
6but again, ignore it
Are you sure it doesn't annoy you?
/me runs.
07</O'Reilly>
03LOL
03I get annoyued by things that are popular for no reason.
6lol O'Reilly
Like Zunes- oh, those aren't too popular
03just because he's popular
03exactly
6because it makes my ears bleed
07XD
6stereotyping things as "popular for no reason" is silly
03orly
6because people do have reasons, just reasons you'd probably deem stupid
03lots of things are popular for no reason
6therefore, not legit
03example A: Paris Hilton
O.o
Oh,nvm
03she was popular a while back
03though she didn't even do anything
6because she was stupid
13The fact that she has a show where she tries to find a bff amuses me
03but she was popular for no reason
03which proves that it happens a lot
6people liked laughing at her
07you mean like the Kardashians now
07:'D
/me 6shrugs
03maybe?
03everybody hated it but yet it was popular
03popular for no good reason
03emphasis on *good* reason
03it may be a BAD reason though
03:P
13Nearly all reality shows have no real reason to them
03something that everybody knows of because of how hated it is doesn't really qualify as popular IMO
03hence why I'm not popular
/me runs
07:'D
6which is different
03eh
03typo
03I meant to say no good reason LOL
6you said it 4 times lol
Copypaste
:o
03now you're being as critical as I am :P
06"can't stop watching the train wreck" thing if you ask me
6I'd have to do it quite often
/me hides
6but yep, I'm done
03also wtf is wrong with my phone
03I just did a factory reset and the thing won't turn on
03I think I broke it
03it's not good
/me hides
03I did it for kicks
03didn't realize doing that would erase my backup image from before I did it >_>
03...LMAO
03best post ever
:o
03because hackers made it work
/me thinks of a Star Wars reference for DRF's phone fail
People made is work on PS3 too.
I give up, continue
03still
03anyway bbl

I can see the refinement on the angles in the DS version but it kinda looks like they lost the detail, I mean look at the floor and Bowser's back shell

13What do you wanted to talk about?
no one cares about ponies
besides you guys
^
^
Am I making myself clear? seriously, we don't want that in here
Care= 3-7/30th
I'm lazy, about to go
Most people are mature enough to STFU instead of whine, there aren't rules about the topic.
Aka. Only 15% cars
*cares
:/
12Dogs
let's make rules
who's with me
ME!
k
15% cars
Well until then, deal with it. (:
No only 2% care
The other 85% is tentacles
/me RUNS
12Pit bull
Tentacles wat
majority rules, really
EW
let's take a vote
The majority doesn't make a fuss.
not everyone in here completely cares
/me stuffs more Tentacruels into cars
the majority of active people, lol
there are 4 of us complaining
and 2 people doinh it
12Those are cool
that's majorityh
-h
^
And there are 30 people in here.
Fixed
Where everyone actually cares?
13So cute.:D
12I know dear
Then they didn't start their own topic.
OK, let's talk about Explosion Day.
because no one wants the ponies.
They GTFO'd till I posted something again, then whined.
?
change the topic lol
They're not even doing anything other than coming on to complain to me.

sudo rm -rf /home/Ascendant/* is unnecessary
10Because they're annoying

isn't there a rule about link spamming?
10Just like posting random memes that are unfitting
13I felt bad for you.

This is dictatorship
10Immature comment is immature

Go back and look.

11Yep!
And the graphics are leaps and bounds ahead of Megadrive
Not the gameplay though. :P

6ICY!
6ICY!

I had very little problems with glitches
6D:
6ICYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Are you saying you preferred Heroes over SA2?
Yep
O_O
SA2 was good, don't get me wrong.
but it had some problems that would kill it for others
I loved SA2, problems or not. I thought Heroes was a gimmicky pile of crap to be honest :P
This is when I was a bit younger, mind you
but SA2 was one of my most played games when I was younger, it had quite a bit of replay value for me and a friend of mine
don't*
Especially Colors
On the Wii especially
http://lugialordoftheseas.deviantart.com/art/Mabinogi-Dragons-214430079
There's nothing wrong with the Dreamcast.
Except that it sunk itself by not playing DVDs.
Then Sega made another mistake: Years later, they took the same games, did nothing to tweak them, and re-released themk on Gamecube
them*
under different names
slightly different names*
I guess.
I never personally owned a Dreamcast, I had a Gamecube, and when they re-released the Director's Cuts for Gamecube I was ecstatic
xD
I have a Dreamcast. :P
/me 6feels sleepy..
It's glorious.
11What time is it where you are?
On good games?
6 7:40 pm
Even good 3D games can have camera issues
Good games usually doesn't have a problem with cameras or controlls.
6What about where you are?
as did Zelda
all 3D games have some kind of issue with the camera if it's not 1st person
It just can
it just can't be helped*
If you're gonna go that route and try to justify it.
And they're not doing anything to try to fix it.
11Late. I am not allowed to tell you the time, however
They jumped ship instead and opt for a 2D solution.
6Meh :P
6Every day I stay on later and later.. o.o
11The reason why is because I stay up most of the time
Guess that's a fair solution. No more embarrasingly bad controlls, and less work. :P
6Good thing it's summer holidays..
Welcome bac

6:O

11Our Summer is unfair. We don't get three months of Holidays. We only get six weeks.

Welp, all my exams are finished now.
6Nope.
Wow.
10 people on the channel.
Actually on IRC.
Shocking.
Dari...
10Hey Dari
Hey.
8well
2Wow
8people explained to him that it was basically pedophilia
8he said "so what?"
Lawl
6Do I have to read this thread I just found called "Friendshipping"?
I hope you didn't forget to clean around my toilet seat.
8actually, that friendshipping thread came out of the shitstorm
Crap, brb
6Okay, just making sure.
Friendshipping. Let that thread sink. ;P
Silly term, but ok.
8something like that
8thats where scootabuse came from
8which also got posted in the aforementioned thread
there's even a fic that takes said comment to it's inevitable extreme
the only problem is it's rated adult
with some sexual content thrown in
Meh sexual content. :/
that's all I'll say on the subject
I shouldn't be surprised.
but by that comment, I'll guess you were
8DARI OUT OF FUCKING NOWHERE
But people watch FiM, and then decide to write that shit.
8people are sick
10Meep
okay good
K cleaned
we don't know the ages of the ponies. For all we know, they're all minors
8thats why i dont like shipping
8thats even worse
That's for sure.
8yeah
paired*
4MI CARA CUANDO
Ofcourse. On the net nothing is sacred.
8why do people have to make them brutally murder each other and have sex with everything that moves
8?
4Because people like it
Uhh, those Apple BloomxSpike don't have any sexual contemt
content*
8when both are clearly too young for it
Maybe not
8cupcakes scarred me
We don't know when a pony is first able to breed
Well the people I told to read it agreed with me that the puns were pretty good.
Barry: Ponies and breeding. Not want. :

Yep.
6DCD said he'd just leave it since I'll be streaming Saturday streams.
I'd share, but I can't D:
6>.<
8we posted about it on our FB and Twitter accounts
That's good. Because I don't like responsibility.
Cheer up :3
/me 8saw that one coming a mile away
4Okay, that's it, I'm joining my own channel. Screw you guys
8maybe one or two i'd say
°O° Face thread is still going?
4I was around for its creation
I posted in it somewhere.
With some neverending loop GIF I made.
XD
4Now I can edie in peace
Lawl.
4*e-die
8what is this "o" face thread? is it the one about shooping the derelle face on to everything else?
4Yeah
6Meh,I'll find some feedance..
8god
8im sooooo sick of that face already
Goooood
4MWHAHAHAHAHAHA
8no
7Where's Rurik? that bastard promised me SC /alive/
4That's news? Really?
8awesome
6*rurikpoke*
He lied to you
No...
Yes.
Nnnnope
dari has to do it
Well you guys could do it. :P
6DARI LIVES.
honestly, i would be fine keeping it as is
needed the password
The wormhole disconnected while he was inside.
He's gone.
6Well, deal with it.
wat
6At least there are two people here. XD
6I had to talk to myself when I wasn't a mod.
Now look who's being mean. :P
6Not mean, just... blunt.
8we have mod business to attend to
There he is.
anyway
I did not hit you D,:
lets talk about these interviews
Well fine. I'll just wallow in my loneliness then.
Jerks. :P
The password was changed >_<
...when did it change? Oo
The Room.
03guys
A challenger appears: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9KyBdPeKHg&feature=related
6Neener. Neener. Neener.
03what nature should I get for my Dream World Espeon'
what's "the room"?
4That's how I got in and people were using it
4I guess it was changed back
13Modest or timid
It did. I don't recall that. XD
Hmm.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNv-tH0Vmik
For some reason this network doesn't keep chanserv in its channels.
8The Room is the worst movie ever made
8we watched it one week
he should
i reminded him of it on FB and he said he knew
03um
03It's not
03I'm just collecging XZD
03*collecting
7Hrm.
03I don't do competitive battling remember
7Get the one with the highest IVs. :P
03I just like having rare ones be natures that suit them
03that doesn't really help
/me 7got a Timid one which happened to have 31 Spd. IVs.
13Timid is +speed -attack
7Modest: increase sp.atk, decrease atk.
7And that.
yes, we need to come up with questions, first of all
03so why would you want -attack for Espeon, because most of its attacks are sp.atk?
6"DO YOU EAT"
7So it's unnecessary to boost it.
03LOL
6How many BMNs have you attended?
Though if you want to mess around, make it a physical attacker. :P
7 2/25%
6For purposes of knowing how it runs.
7Lol, Visimar.
4How professional are you?
6i.e. turbochat, etc
we have to find that out in a more indirect way
6Wtf o.o
good idea
4Dari explained it for me :P
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpfPmvG6CHI&feature=related
/me lolos out loud
O.o
Full of weirdness
NUUUUUU
and for some odd reason I find it highly amusing how annoying it is
03hm
03Naive nature
03*reset*
How can anything be worse than the worse movie ever made?
worst*
7o.O
7There's Zen Headbutt. :P
6I was being semiserious about that. XD
6Ze fook. o.o
Zen Headbutt's pointless if I kept it as a Munna long enough for it to learn Psychic.
4We should find out if they like FiM
oh, also, i think we should post some "borderline" images and ask them how they would deal with the situation
How many people here like roller coasters, besides me?
6That would be... fairly important, actually.
03Calm nature *reset*
03also EW MUNNA
03and the rest of 5th gen
6Yes, agreed.
Did you get the promotion?" "Nah..." "You didn't get it... did you?"
4Sure
12wow
7Hmm.
12Visimar
12that name takes me back
Hm? Do I know you?
with those, it's REALLY important that we not lead them though
6I like troller coasters
12hmm do you?
6http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Uztj3vp-RI&feature=related
Oh!
4Then how do you propose we reveal to them those pictures?
Long time no see. :3
4*shrugs*
1 sec
4Sounds straightforward
12yeah hi, how's it going?
let me do an example
6lol "No links during the stream" is correct answer
Eh. It's been alright for the most part.
12don't you live in indiana?
Not much has really changed, except for my maturity.
I still do, yeah.
As long as they don't go up for all eternety. I don't like heights.
4We're gonna be interviewing euro applicants, yeah?
12sweet
that's cool.
Wait
12pokemon tcg nationals is being held in indianapolis
12this year
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTz89FEa4c&feature=player_embedded
And by maturity I meant in the mental sense, not physical. I'm 23. :P
The ones that go up several hundred feet at the start
12i'm 21
Well, I'm not sure I'm willing to attend. Don't like going that far, plus I'm not too interested in the TCG.
Hi, Stolen
Yes I did
well, not quite
03Brave nature *reset*
people can post picture links
i do it pretty frequently as a reaction image
6xD Yeah I like that one too :P
6Well, as long as it's not being spammed in the stream.
6Can't see that last vid..
6xD Dari
Tsk tsk
12i've been trying to drag drf along XD
6If they're posted every now and then, whatever.
03LOL
03I'd go if I could
6But when we can see 5 of them at once... that's an issue.
6JB FTW!
ok
4...are these euro applicants we're interviewing?
he's gone
or she
6BYE MFW!
lol
6*checks*
6Oh, wow, it actually wasn't MFW
03Gentle nature *reset*
yes, these are euro applicants
4Thank you
6Steal an identity?
6WTF
check identities
Lol
6Nope. Anybody can.
really?
6You just have to know how.
03is it Helios? :P
6>>; I can't see the image.
I said I wouldn't name.
12well
And no, it isn't him.
4I can
6JB FTFW!
12the person must not be here since he's still here then :P
I got over that.
6It means it's blocked on my wifi.
Ok
until it turned out it wasn't him
or her
6Which generally means it's from a site that allows bad images.
6^^
them*
12blah
12the word slipped in x-x
Dari: I like that..............
12we all have a bias pronoun we like to let slip in when we don't know the gender of something
Gnite all
Night
12night
I'm here guys
6o.o
03hm
also is it just me
Heh, understandable.
2it was awesome
03what do you guys think
03should I still keep trying for one of the others?
8its you, it looks normal to me
6It does it to me all the time
kay
brb
6I know.
6I checked it.
12modest or timid
I myself don't care much for natures, unless they lower a good stat or defenses.
13But then again
03meh
03I'll softreset
13My espeon in HG is neutral-natured and she's pretty damn strong
7Okay.
6PM'd you
Bah.
6I would imagine.
I saw "AE" and I immediately thought of Agent Elrond. :<
4Eww
4Kill Bill
6There's a reason it's blocked on my wifi.
4that movie was boring
13and she's 1-hit-KO'd a Mewtwo before
13but I dunno
7ô.o
13maybe the other trainer on PBR just trained really badly
13xD
ok
4Facebook?
03PBR doesn't count
12o-o
03that thing is a piece of junk
6It's cool.
Lol wut?
6There he is.
6Yeah
4Will do, Hip
kay guys
13She's half-EV trained, since I didn't even know how to EV train when I first got her in-game
Granted, it was around 8-9 levels higher at that point, but still.
go ahead
03LOL referring to Pokémon like they're people
03I always call mine "it"
6http://a8.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/247307_230355343647678_100000196417709_1092371_2171020_n.jpg
well, first of all, we should go ahead with the basics:
13her main weakness is that she's incredibly easy to take down if you land a hit |D
And then I catch it and find out it has a Hasty nature. That explained it. >.>
"How much time would you have available-o ok
well
here goes the rest
13Lol drf, you can call me silly if you want but I get really attached to some of my teams :P
03yes, you are silly :P
and we are going to show them some borderline pics and ask how they would deal with them
/me 7suddenly mentally rages.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMR4XBFEqLY
No this one
03EW THAT FACE
7But you need imperfect stats for that. D:
Why do you think you're the right person for the job?
6http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3n0vBcW5fc&feature=related
6DO YOU EAT?
03pokesav
7The ironic thing is that he hasn't been "the young people" for at least ten years
03Quirky nature *reset*
oh
7Don't rush him, 'kay?
?
6xD
4when you clearly act like a tool and are arrogant half the time lol
7yeah but he somehow makes money off of it!
7Or if multiple ones are the highest. O_o\
7-\
/helping it spread?
7Speaking of, a Reshiram I got off the GTS:
6...not really sure if that's something we should get into right away...
7Zero IVs in EVERYTHING.
4I've seen worse
6Don't want to open a can of worms.
Haha, oh wow.
i think we need to ask it
13LOL
03that prolly means it's hacked
7Also, how am I a tool?
4Can of worms?
7Indeed.
03then again
03Reshiram is worth about zero anyway
7But it's trading fodder.
03so it works
7I'm not saying he's not talented, it's just his arrogance is disproportionate
Like Gulliver's travels... terrible 3d
these people are going to be moderators, we need to find out how they can help us get more fans
03you can also just use pokesav
yeah
plus
03it's not cheating if you don'/t change any
4I dunno. I just felt like sayin git
7there was no 3D in that film
it's not defaming anybody, nor being mean
6There was :P
2http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=723533&l=917a06fd0e&id=100000677805603 DONE @_@
There was in the theater I go to
6That's awesome :O
2* http://a3.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/270668_219736044725654_100000677805603_723533_7917205_n.jpg
and if they turn it into a shitstorm, that just means they arent qualified to be one of our moderators
03Lax nature *reset*
7Anyone want?
2Thanks XD
Even after the millions of Audino I slaughtered.
Hello.
4It does sound a little underhanded, but meh
2:P
I know I'm 11 minutes early, but there's no crime in that, right?
We like their idea but don't make them a moderator?
We give them credit and special thanks, plus some perks
win-win
Oh, RSpanner's Yahoo.
^agree
plus we'll eventually need more mods
4it wasn't me
4Perks?
mainly voice during BMNs
7I had a descriptive chart somewhere but I appear to have lost it
4ah
03ooh
6Can I add you Rurik?
03Modest nature
as in, not quite mods but kind of VIP
4go nuts
2Really dari? You only just guessed?
6o.o
03attack 16, defense 18, sp.atk 36, sp.def 24, speed 27
6I like that idea.
theres still 1 thing i want to get resolved
of course
13Go for it :P
before using said methods
if we don't choose them for mod position
03nah
we would of course negotiate with them
03don't feel like it
we need to find out a way of gauging their professionalism without straight up asking them
6xD
7Lemme check on serebii, then:
13I'm not too fussy about IVs though
The one where Iraped a toaster
6Added :P
Oh, lol.
hypothetical scenario presentation?
03um
good idea
03it didnt'say
03eh
03OK
Kjakings' toaster to be exact
03hold on
03I'm currently tucking in someone
7All right.
03and then I need to leave
(:
Haha.
Good luck with that.
03and now bbl
"Suck" is a naughty word, for it refers to a sexual act.
I am surprised at you, Dari.
6XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDd
7Average values: 14, 4, 14, 24, 4, 4.
7Again, values are indecisive due to it being a low level.
03I can find out its IVs later.
03remind me.
7Blame mibbit, Dari. if it actually put epic-chat back on I would be here more often
6Though it usually involves sugar.
This is it. XD

My Little Pony?
yep
sigh, i have 3
And a girl?
Hahahahahahahahaha!
Pure win
12hmm
Guys, get a load of this!
7My Espeon's a dual screener/status bouncer. >>
Barry likes My Little Pony!
It lacks Spiderman.
isn't that why we're all here?
..Thanks for ruining my shtick.
oh?
REMAKE IT BUT BETTA DIS TIME
worse*
immediately after se7en.
4Well...fuck
but let's just say
not yet
it'll have you SQUEALING for mercy.
Oh yeah, I just realised I won't get to see Se7en, I'll be on holiday.
we still need a hypothetical to gauge professionalism
7Mmm....
Then we'll find poochy and have a rematch
7I'd counter that.
:P
6That movie looks like it'll be fun to make fun of.
6He talked to me a while ago on msn..
I showed you guys WalrusGuy's review of Spider's Web, right?
lemme think
6Spider's Web
4Ah
http://naveryw.deviantart.com/journal/29716131/
how about, someone insulting said mod
6:O
13My Espeon in HG has a moveset that's based around countering her weaknesses than anything else
Pedoforks never learn
6xD
When I saw it sometimes I was laughing AT the movie
and sometimes I was laughing WITH the movie
13so I should do something about that |D
yes, good idea
just like WalrusMan predicted.
There's a scene where the main character, Walt, robs a gas station
7Mmm'kay.
6Obviously not going to use SprinkleTheSecond
4What if they catch on?
8taco, this is like the 4th time you have posted it now :D
13then again I'm not a competitive battler, I just EV train and such because I like seeing the results of my hard work :P
6I'll try to make sure they won't.
6And if they do, ask them to prove it.
I actually went to Toys'R'Us (they have lots of knock off movies in their cheapo movie bin) to buy it.
That just means he likes it that much
It's the only movie that's bad AND good at the same time.
6Hey
wait a minute
dari
13Hi!
can you help us out with this?
13Nice to see you again!
6How are ya
6?
13Good.
cuz they cant /whois to find out then, right?
13I don't know.
Some of the things he did were good.
6And if they do, that's the proof I'm asking that they provide.
Like the room review XD
ok
13:)
6Because that'll be a good measure of how much they know about IRC, aswell.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BM6Hx6dK8aI&NR=1
13but then I discovered how bad his IVs are |D
Lol.
I didn't leave in the last 30 seconds. :P
and dari
13Squidwrak!
6GAH
6NOT THAT THUS AGAIN
/me 7blinks.
ok, dari, do you want to ask questions or just observe?
13Not me.
I'm here for whatever you need me to do. XD
6http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXGc2qhhi3o
Fine, I'll watch, I'm a half-op anyway.
4I'm here, I feel like shit, but I'm here
6Also, I'm GREAT_and_POWERFUL
13I never knew you know Avatar. :D
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMS7gcHq1Bk
7Did you EV train it? O_o
4Yeah, I should be
alright
I'm waiting for whoever's doing the interview to interview me. ..Unless this was the interview all along. In which case, I'm screwed.
13.......Link (The Legend of Zelda).
No, ben.../
1 sec
6Love Avatar.. :P I can draw Zuko too :P
13Oh.
13Zuko rockes!
6DEPRESSING SONG OF DEPRESSMENT
6Zuko ftw!
13Sorry, went afk for a minute |D
6He's really fun to draw too..
4Yeah, I wanted to fuck with him as well

6TELL ME!
I was here for The Room
Convince me little one...
6There is a way. It's essentially the same.
4Where are you located, Taco?

i want to gauge his commitment
Kitten, why scared?
6Wait..
/me 6presents Megatron.
Copy the hostname

Maybe mibbit has a built in alias for it.
I'll check for you.
thats an awful answer
I have 6 Megtrons
6Absolutely horrid.
6GAH.
4Finishing up my questions

13Hope it's yummy.
just those 3 i gave you should be good
6ULTRATRON
4*nods*
13Everyone! Eat MEGETRON!
During the summer, it's any time between 3:00 PM and 2:30 AM.
/me 6waves Ultratron in front of Icy's face.
EST.
13Yup.
8What about during the fall?
I get home at 3:00 PM during the fall
I'm still here, but I'm visiting other tabs
(that's the time I wake up during the summer XD)
and I go to sleep at about 10:30 PM.
6*cringe again*
6Meh..
8and this is on fridays and saturdays, correct?
On Saturdays during the fall, I get up around noon and probably go to sleep around 1:00 AM.
2deathbatx is arriving shortly!
6I'm already thinking about saying no... but we'll see. It's only the beginning.
8so, to make sure i have this straight
13Are you going to eat Ultratron?
:-P
During the fall, yes.
8and on saturday you are available from noon-1 AM?
Yes.
8ok
I'm now assuming this position wouldn't take effect until the fall.
Yes.
6Haii!
6Do you have any experience moderating?
Ahoy capn'.
2:D
No.
Evening
yeah
6Are we alternating, or am I giving all of my questions at onceZ?
6*once?
I have experience reporting rude people TO moderators on forums.
2DEATHBAT
13Bored.
2:D
Just do them all, that's easier.

4God, my head's pounding
Am I normal?

I'm a fast reader and can generally keep up with a speedy chatroom.
13Yes, you're normal.
6We should definitely try getting something in the Daily /oat/
6*cookies
No, now I'm a furry, bi, and a little more mature
6I'm going to do a followup
NO!!!
6xD

6Oka
6*Okay

6^^
7Ugh. I'm all out of habit with being in a chatroom
6And ze Zacky?

I think 300 viewers per showing is enough.
6Do you like pancakes?
13Me too.
No
6Yeah we like pancakes!
Not particularly
6*CRINGE*
13Yes.
6Do you like french toast?
7YEAH WE LIKE FRENCH TOAST
6Yeah we like french toast!
Lol.
6WAFFLES
13I don't know, I never taste it beofre.
I like pie
6I think I just died inside.
6Me neither :P
wow, this is about the worst this interview could possibly have gone
6PIZZA FTW
6WAFFLEEEEEEEEEEES
Ok then.
Why do you want to be a BMN moderator?
6You haz no proof.
6Please,pl0x,whatever.....
hiya
*slaps Tran_Pham* Where's Mr.Krabs!?!?
I'm pretty much wasting all my time. I sleep in, wake up, each junk food, browse Ponychan, stare at the walls...
oh
Though I've got to say that I like that he's honest.
my
7Meep/
I figured this would be a good use of my time, and it could help raise my self-esteem.
Kitten, why scared?
>why do you want to be a moderator?
fi..finland...Ah, Touridor's GF
6I like the honesty... but it won't get him very far on this.
13He die because I took his monney. Mwuhaha!
6Beneath ze tartar sauce! I saw him!
FIEND!
that is literally the worst answer i can think of
6I like the self esteem part... but the rest of it... *shudder*
Alright.
7Mmm?
Do you have any previous IRC experience?
Skuidward?!
*feind?
6inb4 what's IRC?
lol
4If anything, I hope he isn't that brutally honest IRL interviews
13Spongebob!
ello
...This is an IRC room?
6OH SHIT
called it
LOL
Speng bab >;3
13Patrick.
Yep, you're on a mibbit client.
6I WAS JUST JOKING.
Ok.
ok then
and i need to know do you need anything like "US" or "United States of America" to be written to it?
Aw, how cute :3
now
ofc the address
Of course, go on.
TBH I don't have much to say about IRC specifically.
(: <4
6Plankton.
*MUCH FUCK
*<3
next issue is, how do we tell him he isnt getting the mod gig?
I am currently a semi-regular on the Phineas and Ferb Wiki Chatroom.
I was there before he discovered Synchtube.
13Who?
6As politely as possible.
6So this is the world you left behind..This is the guilt that consumes you...
I havnt been here in 38957392847923749237.4 and a half years..
6Such an awesome song... :3
Weeks you mean?
6...just how sick are you right now? Oo
Hahaha.
do we say "we decided we are going in a different direction", or "We'll let you know"?
4I have constant diarrhea, my head pounds every time I move, and I think I have an ear infection
13..............
6Neither?
that sucks man
6Ouch. That really sucks.
?
Yep.
4...he sure does like to talk
not really a good thing for a mod
Well, just for good measure, tell me both.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jItz-uNjoZA
D:
4I like how dari is still questioning him even though we've made up our minds
I discovered the series on October 19th, the day it was posted about on Cartoon Brew.
might as well
you didnt
D;
During the entire past year I've been checking Cartoon Brew daily
: D
13I don't know,
I'm just trying to be civil. XD
yeah, that would be pretty mean
When I saw the words "Lauren Faust", my first thoughts were "OMG she wrote one of my favorite PPG episodes".
I watched the episode
4But I have a rude sense of humor
and enjoyed it.
6o.o
6...I can't look away.
4OMG
4O
4M
4G
I discovered the /co/ community in-between episodes 6 and 7.
6PEDOSPORK
4That bothers me
4I know it shouldn't, but that makes me cringe
13http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtN1YnoL46Q
I already discussed my history with the Synchtube.
6I'm working on it.
*wheeze*
cool beans
4I'll help :D
6xD
bahahaha
6Wtf o.o
13XD
That's pretty much it.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78DBf2_9Esg
Alright then, thanks.
should we just say, we'll let you know once we finish conducting interviews?
6I guess.
Is the interview over?
and then keep conducting interviews until we find someone?
lol
8not yet
Hold meh
8this is the last part
here we go
8im going to show you 3 pictures
6xDDD
Just when you thought it couldn't get worse.
6XD
4That would be one of the very worst answers you could give
6That was random
13okay..........
4Or comment
ko
8we'll go one at a time
I haven't listened to this in over a day.
I need my hit.
Are these pornographic?
4"What do you see in this first picture" :P
10:P
6LOL
4Huh
8are you not allowed to view pornographic images?
4He kinda sucked the air out of the interview
facehoof
13............
10Wb?
It's not that I'm not allowed
FUCKING PONIES! >;D
it's that some pornography is disgusting.
6...this is... *facehoof*
yeah I closed out accidentally
I can handle naked pictures.
fail
6It's kinda addicting.. o.o
Naked pictures of children make me go "eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee" and I close it.
4Wow
DARI DID THIS TO ME
4EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
8ok, well these are pictures that you may have to deal with if you become a moderator
Videos/pictures of things I can't even describe
4Sprinkles
I'll give an example.
4Don't do that again >:I
and I wish I didn't.
/me 6high-fives Dari
I vomited in my mouth
XD
6...did he just mention 2g1c?
/me high-fives back.
yes
4Okay, seriously, this is becoming a really, really bad interview
yes he did
13Bye people! It's great talking to you!
I went to the bathroom and rinsed my mouth out for a good 20 minutes.
4Now I pretty much agree with you guys
The taste literally didn't go away.
You gonna get raped
8are you ready to do this part of the interview?
6>:3
6BAHAHA
4Lol, Hip "are you ready now?"
If it's nudes and not girls pooping in each other's mouths, sure.
canttelliftrollingorjustverystupid.jpg
Wow.
4Just post them Hip
4Let's get this done quickly plox
You're going to show me pictures
8yes
>In interview, talk about vomiting in mouth
8here is the first one: http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/b0888f66a008c11f490c79ec5656059f/26664%20-%20artist%3Aopalwhisker%20Cupcakes%20dexterous_hooves%20dress%20fanfic%20pinkie_pie.png
.....
4That's not a very good drawing
I'd give them a warning.
That is, if there's a rule against it.
TBH I'm kind of baffled that this would be considered bad.
4I don't even know how to explain it
4Pretty much that
6...*facehoof*
6>if there's a rule against it
6He never stops talking. XD
wow, he got the answer right and still managed to fuck it up
Well, that's a little harsh.
I'll kick them for the rest of the night.
no, he said kick
4Warning>kick>ban
Wow, he changes his mind a lot.
4He got it right
And keeps talking.
8ok
6He said kick for the rest of the night.
4...but he DOESN'T STOP GOING
4HE CONTINUES
8 2nd image: http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/9bb1e06e5055352e074ea08c043bdbcc/26603%20-%20artist%3AEchidnaJoe%20implied_rape%20lesbian%20Mrs_Sparkle%20Trixie%20twilight_sparkle.png
6I just noticed that SR is here.. o.o
6What is this one?
Lol, SR hardly ever actually comes on any more.
*hugs and kisses* welcome back <3
While that's mildly disturbing, there is no visisble genitalia.
6...ew.
Kick for 10-15 minutes.
He hates us
wrong answer
No warning, just immediate 10-15 minute kick.
6AND WAY WRONG.
6Also, implying you can place a time on kicks.
^
Hey dari...
lol
6XD
Yeah?

4http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSw-2XtF44
6What is this one?
I can't read the text on the bottom of the image.
i was thinking more like this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8hka0XK-O4
It's not even sex. It's just kissing...between two characters that are the same person.
I see no reason to punish anyone for this.
wrong
..Is this against the rules?
6inb4 endless talking
There wouldn't be an objection if it was a male and a female kissing. Objecting to it if it's two females would be biggotry. I think images of any two genders kissing is acceptable, and that ALL imagery of sexual intercourse is unacceptable.
...Is it bigotry or biggotry? Hmm.
7How is he drinking?
like
I vanish first
hi Ant!
then..
I come up behind someone
6o.o
and
Bye!
bang
dey go down and I run away.
hi Aero
8D
4don't ask

sorry
mountain dew
13Yes
/me approves of Mountain Dew
4So, is Barry next?
HEY DAR.
no, i dont think barry is interviewing
Fai
I think he just lurks, Dari style.
*Fail XD
4I dunno, he said he was still there just in another tab
/me spins around wildly
4Should we ask if wants to be interviewed?
meh
i think he would have made it clearer if he wanted to be
6I'm kind of scared of future interviews after that one. Oo
Lol.
4Taco...
nothing can be that bad
You shouldn't have said that...
6http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2008-07-09-epicfail.jpg
4Taco's problem is that he didn't know when to stop talking
and he was WAY too honest
4Yeah...
4I kinda wanted to ask him how old he was
6I did not need to be told about when he saw 2g1c...
LOL
the worst one was his answer for why he wanted to become a mod
"because I'm bored"
Oh yeah. XD
the only answer worse than that would be "because i like to abuse my power"
4Again, I like the honesty but it did not serve him well
I still think "improvements?" "Nahhh" was pretty bad.
/me shot
06o.o
http://sebastianwolff.info/news/2011/01/tron-sheet-music/ < Random
10Ew diet
13Never tried it, but I probably would
13|D
its very good
the reg mtn dew is ew
10Tron Legacy had an awesome soundtrack :3
/me runs
13I don't taste the difference between diet and normal
13for any drink
13o-o
6I loved some of the one word answers.
10The movie wasn't fantastic though
More active than it's been in a loooooooooong time.
oh my lord, that was bad too
6Up until they turned in to thousand word answers.
Well, more people.
Not really more active.
6"Do you have any experience moderating?" "No."
THATS THE JOB!
lol havn't been on here i think since like february
4AGain, I wanted to ask him how old he was
:P
Hello.
6SILVER YOU JUST MISSED THE BIGGEST TRAINWRECK EVER
I told you
you just missed the biggest trainwreck in job interview history
oh?
Yes it did :P
let me recap for you
10Disney ruined it with no romance
/me hides
when asked how many BMNs he had been to, he said 4
Hey.
Good excuse. :D
12Hello
Aww, the midis are only 1 track
Shame
4Yeah, I wouldn't have actually been upset about that one
on to the next cringe moment
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcYiJDGFvMo
12Nope, atleast not yet XD
His answer: I think 300 people is too many already
You should, it's fun, though the IRC channel is a bit fast with >250 people in it.
10Yep
6I died.
6<prince-dari>: Do you have any previous IRC experience? <Tacowiz>: ...This is an IRC room?
10Silly cartoons
13Love should not be censored, if anything the world needs more of it D:
10^
and then came the worst part IMO
we asked why he wanted to become a moderator
then I disliked it because she died
I dont care if she was evil
D<
We had the same critique come from someone else.
10Maleficent?
yes
: D
and then we got to the questionable pictures part
6And the images part... *shudder*
6GET OUT OF MY HEAD
Lawl.
lol
i was showing him pics and asking him how he would respond as a moderator
10[17:19] <Anthony> I dont care if she was evil <- Evil never wins
he basically said "i dont like looking at gross images"
10Proven fact
lies
D:'
Evil usually wins
When the hero is a failure :p
interesting.
Like in Megamind
10Fine, 'short' victories
/me hides
Sometimes evil wins in horror films.
then
i actually showed him the images
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/9bb1e06e5055352e074ea08c043bdbcc/26603%20-%20artist%3AEchidnaJoe%20implied_rape%20lesbian%20Mrs_Sparkle%20Trixie%20twilight_sparkle.png
hmm...
his response was: this is mildly disturbing, i would kick them
oh shit, youre right
heh, no
yeah, it is.
thats an instaban
Really?
6Yep.
implied rape and rule 34
Fuck me
4What were you guys saying?
6Show him the one that's just a warning.
lol
6The other.
oh yeah
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/39928ecc6ab5e77d15f055a6d2fdf935/26744%20-%20celestia%20Dear_Princess_Celestia%20kissing%20letter%20luna%20Nightmare_Moon%20shock%20wtf.png
this pic
4And yeah, it's in the rules
we would warn for this pic
4So it would be grounds for instapermaban
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bjGVqrDfEs&feature=related
6Since it's controversial, I assume? I can't see the image.
he said he wouldnt do anything
and then went on a rant about how people dont like it because its 2 females
and that it would be diff if it were a man and woman

04:3
4Don't know how dari feels, though
Lol.
i think i can guess...
Is Barry here for an interview or is he lurking?
lurking
Heheh, I wouldn't like to be the one to tell him, but I'd say no.
/me prods Barry with a stick.
10Nintendo got lazy with animations
4I'd tell him
Sorry, it's just really hot in my house because my air conditioner broke
4That really sucks
11HE'S ALIVE! *hides*
4God, I know that feeling
We could just put a list of accepted mods on BMN
If they're name isn't on there, they didn't make it.
Yes dear?
jk, you actually made me laugh
whenever we get a mod or 2
11My dumbass roomates keep lowering the thermostat to 60. -.-
4But we actually haven't found anyone yet, correct?
4Right
4Well, that first interview was not the best way to begin our screening for mods
11The problem is that we can't have the AC below 65, because it actually FREEZES it.
4That could be potentially disasterous
It'll get more responses then.
4We'd have a shitload of people asking to be mods and we'd get flooded I'd bet
those dumbass polarbears
04well they had to make animations for EVERY SINGLE ONE
04give them a break |D
11lol
I'm fine with the thermostat set at 70
/me 8sets his thermostat to 60
unfortunately, I can't even have that
10It's not that much of a challenge </obviousarcasm>
11As long as it's below 80 in my room, I don't give a damn.
lurk for a little
see if anyone else shows up
/me 7D:s
with that then, I go to make the next News Report.
