Filtered, homogenized "fun"
7to broadcast here yes
oooooooooooh, you mean start my own room and get you guys in on it you mean?
Oh.
7yes
Yeah, I can do that.
although I have no idea how Veemi works :(
7I shall PM you ReticentSmolder_
03so we can play together XD
there are plenty of places for them to discuss those things
6Ghosties, I know that feel, but unfortunately that's how modding tends to work.
but not everyone here likes it
and we have to act in the best interests of everyone
We haven't asked them
i can safely assume that most of our viewers dont enjoy shitstorms over religion
Assume
02Off to watch something bbs
as mods
thats the job
Do you see why I hate that rule?
if we asked everyone about every decision we make, nothing would ever get done
Those topics are bad for discussion.
6Pocahontas
ffffuuuuu
At least you're honest
even when it isnt in the best interests of our viewers or the event
I hear "punishing all for the mistakes of the few"
If I may add something?
of course sathi
For this entire discussion we have the last rule on the draft
I say put leave the drama outside
04o-o
Yes
Yes
I completely agree with that
;o
that is very open to misinterpretation though
Still it gives us freedom
to do what's right
You're assuming, and you're undermining our judgment
er, not 2, the movie from 06
start*
We need to agree on these rules as a team
I have seen it a good bit, but I might watch it I can never seem to catch the first half-hour.
7get the program
Well...that won't be to terrible as long as you use a player with full screen options
That's honestly how it comes off to me
its for the viewers
i give those as examples of topics to avoid because they ALWAYS turn into shitstorms
...
no u
whats with egg face anyway?
My router exploded.
nah
XD
too much info
keep it simple
KiS
Egg...face...egg-face...egg face...eggface?
yep ;)
You just left out a line
6I took out some to make it seem less strict.
6It's the same basic idea though.
Sathi's wording is best
It relates to the fandom, after all
But it's still an example
And it relates to the fandom
7I missed... that pic
03Frick I lost this minigame >_>
It tells them "leave the drama at the door"
And really
Then here it is again:http://www.webguild.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/egg_face_google.jpg
7thank you!
lol
you got the power!?!?!
7I do?
there was one about furries before for sure
yes
one about religion (during monty python IIRC)
the power of frienship
imho try to keep the rules simple and easy to read.. no need to use examples for everything
and forget that it includes other things
if we list multiple things, it doesnt single them out though
Then keep it related to the fandom
7hihi thanks
I forgot to say it earlier when it was announced...
Things that relate to our demographic

I am sorry, I saw the opening and went for it
Hah

... we're screwed
MUAHAHAHA
problem is though, conversation doesnt always stay limited to the fandom
I'm supposed to be doing something for school right now... fcuk der poleic.
:P
perhaps I can help
FUCK DA....lost my train of thought
ha.
oh.
nooo!

/me cuts line
I guess you....
/me puts on sunglasses
It really is
myself included
get out :P
YEEEEAAAAH
*facehoof*
Syrup is goddamn pony menstruation blood for fuck's sakes
That's okay, but gore isn't?
Dammit, I fucked up my grammar on that line....
i dont know of anyone that HATES syrup
Oh well.
hate=/=controversial though
and godwins law has been fulfilled now
6Not at all.
evening
NO WAY!
GIBT MIR DIEN LINK
7with help :P
I am asking you as a person
From one person to another
Don't include it, please
/me pokes ClockworkPie with a stick, just to be sure.
oww~
no way
7use the PM's pls ;)
/me pokes ClockworkPie again.

/me backs away, slowly...
/me 12mind asploded
reticentSmolder_ I'll check it out if you don't mind.
/me quietly loads his revolver.
nothing good can come from having discussion of them
Just in case....
I just can't believe you don't see the problem with it
O.o
/me starts to panic
/me 12would want it too tho X3
/me sees a wild ClockworkPie appear!
I feel like you don't even see where I'm coming from
/me uses tackle
i honestly and truly dont, and heres why:
/me is hit by tackle. Its not very effective...
/me uses revolver!
6otherwise yes
You're trying to herd them into being cattle
/me throws a ponyball!
/me faints ;_;
/me catches ClockworkPie in the ponyball!
/me is now in a ponyball
XD
all it takes is a handful of people to ruin the entire event
hi Kosoveo
/me faints!
fu
I fucking get it
well excuse me
nooo master
/me shot
6lol
I understand that it can cause drama to stir up, I know. Religion and politics do that
then why is this such an issue?
its bad for the event, therefore, we're not doing it
Back
But you don't seem to see that telling people to not talk about religion or politics is basically saying that you can't talk about anything that's not safe
You are labeling these people
O:
Next we won't be able to talk about sex
Lol, I just told it to change my name but it didn't
|D
I'm the idealist?
Damn, I can't do /(Someone else's name)
?
patty's hardcore
D:
:P
Gah, stupid client
/me shrugs.
7nope :)
/me 's computer engineering knowledge has no effect!
lol
IRC999
There
Of course it's stupid
Hi Zoroark
Use a real client like mibbit
They have iPod app?
cool
< App
< Failure
Use the terrible browser that is included
Or use a computer :P
Fuck.
Stupid channel modes disappearing.
Forget BC2. I'm too out of it to do well.
?
Whoops
Wrong channel.
6We'll still get them anyway.
As amusing as that is
+e?
wat
6It's part of our job as a mod to deal with those questions.
As amusing as that is
Exactly, we are the complaint guys after all
I had my volume allll the way up
Got any grapes?
GOT ANY NAILS?
FIRST, YOU MUST BRING ME....A SHRUBBERY
the first*
Hiya.
I'm sad that I can't hang around here during the week. Also, my phone doesn't like connecting to this server.
But we're the complaint guys, if the viewers have questions then they can just come to us
Yeah.
exactly
Tells me to replace my ethernet cable on my router (which has been working for a long time)
ohhhh shit
nice
Lol, I didn't complain
and you guys can explain then
That's right
>real client
>mibbit
22:53] <Pattyrick|shower> Gah, stupid client
Well yes Zoroark
Seems like a complaint
Mibbit is a real client compared to IRC999
No, statement, not complaint :P
I guess computer knowledge comes in like a wave.
IRC999
It's the reason why we decided to implement mods as complaint people. If they have questions, then they come to us and we handle it
You can never start learning everything at once.
oO
Never heard of this one
Use Mibbit
yeah i haven't either
/me is gonna play some OoT tonight
Same
On my iPod?
Only iTards use it
get colloquy
.-.
02Hmm
02that was pretty cool
i never had too many problems with colloquy
Colloquy is worth the money I say
the only problem was that it crashed after a while due to not deleting logs after a while
/me hides
but it's my fault for idling in channels with lots of activity
I can probably get it for free
Ok
Brb
6I understand this.
7I'm blonde... I have my bf for computer knowledge if I need it :P
How about Syrup
syrup isnt a divisive topic though
Syrup is disgusting
6Syrup is not as highly controversial.
No one wants to talk about pony menstruation blood
6And we have allowed discussion on that front in the past.
ive never seen a shitstorm start over syrup
...do they?
It's worth the USD$1.99
ewww..
first time I heard of that...
sathi: ponychan meme
See
hi J
Sathi thinks it's disgusting
(There wouldn't even be a need for half of the 'apps' if some lazy company added a proper browser and OS to their tablet)
6Which means we need something that is.
hi Kos
6Exactly.
can we talk about networking?
And we all know how underpowered the Wii is
6I honestly say we should attempt to limit the "soandso is best pony" talk, but that's just me.
/me RUNS
and I have Local Area Networks on the brain man
i've used mibbit on my iPod
When I had one that is
6...I have yet to have a fun one.
I used Mibbit on my iPhone as well
6Ever.
and they usually dont end in anyone getting upset
A bit wonky
6Wrong again.
You'd be surprised...
Terrible :P
colloquy's the best IRC client yeah
on iOS that is
>mfw ive never gotten upset during a best pony conversation
I just got it, let me switch to it
I'm gonna say that the title goes to Linkinus
dari, you banned soipony
People don't tend to argue.
...
for disliking rd
Wut?
exept for the fact you gotta pay for the sucker
12oww ;-;
Oh.
I unbanned him straight away.
I could call up my father...but I think he is in china right now...
that was a silly thing though
Lawl, I trollban people all the time.
Let me check
No one cares.
just ask dari.
what's wrong glacy? :(
7Aye ask Dari
he's a genius.
No one argues anyway?
nope.avi
The conversations just go like this:
12i took a shower
6Again, just my personal opinion.
^
Yikes
that happens to me every time
I'd definitely say include religion and politics in the rules.
thats why I always have a washcloth nearby
12i don't know how it happened
7it's alive!
Yeah, he's still in china
Do you see why it's oppressive to include religion and politics?
12i was shampooing my head
7*giggles*
doesn't help much
shampoo is really tricky
Haha, Sathi. XD
no, i dont, since theyre more or less going to be against the rules anyway
...
FUCKING TAB BUTTON
6Hipster, not necessarily.
ASDIOPGAOPWDJFGPAOJKWEPKOAQWERGKOP
pwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwease?
heres an example:
/me shrugs
eh, not going to give an example unless you want me to
also.. we have tools for shitstorms +m channel for instance
Are you using FME?
...no?
sathi: once they begin, they dont stop easily
Hmmm
I rarely get shampoo in my eyes
But we've stopped it, Hip
ho do I shot web?
We always have
10lolol
Maybe because you rarely shampoo?
we stopped it before it turned into a shitstorm though
well no matter how many times I try I always get at least a little shampoo in my eyes
once its in progress, its much harder
I just tilt my head forwards or back when washing the shampoo off, until they are rinsed off
6And again, we have to do our jobs as mods.
even if I close them or I was the shampoo off quickly
*was
*WASH
6If it comes to that it comes to that.
ummm, SoundMax? I'm just choosing the software my speakers use but I guess I'm not using any software
lol live stream is such a ram gobler
and wb Pat
That's how it comes off
@FlutterHi yeah it is, but its free
People get pissed off when those topics come up.
but
Thanks Aero
Good
12o-o
Then you should be able to trust uis
*us
once 200 people start talking about it, a mute and a warning isnt going to stop it
I got it free because mine is jailbroken and I have Installeous :P
I'm using Livestream, and their client Procaster
and a banning spree is just going to get people angry
also aero
Why'd you jailbreak it
Kos?
6And yet we have a rule about that kind of thing anyway.
*contain it
lol pirating apps on iOS
D:
nuuuuuu
6It's our job to contain it BEFORE it happens.
Exactly
We're mods
to stop it BEFORE it happens
But we always have stopped it before it happens
6Hipster, that's why we just don't put in ANY examples.
6We have a failsafe in our disclaimer.
Hmm, I've never used that site.
Or procaster.
And, if I need to get rid of it, I just update
7or sounds*
http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/palemale-store_2170_1135405
7yes
7I can even zoom into the tools I use
I heard that you could hear my music faintly but it had static
hey
They are
Ironic
he's not going to know he's unbanned though
the problem there is people could just decide not to bring up any topic that they think might cause ANY disagreement
Mmmhmmm
?
>Not bothered :P
:D
Not really, just plain stupid
Like you
:)
Somebody we know eh?
because "controversial" isnt defined in that case
Like a boss
Yeah.

/me explodes.
hmm can you teach me?
you know how you can get email addresses with a "company name" or whatever at the end?
not today? :/
~yay~
is there a way we can do that for free?
what're they showing later
Yeah.
I think.
6I'm sure there is.
like mine would be HipsterBrony@bronystate.com or w/e
BAM
or yeah, something like that
Lol.
There's something like 5 free emails with the free domain.
hmmmm
well
6Not exactly enough of them.
We could get 2 domains just for emails or something.
You might be onto something.
Oh, look, I spoke too soon
And then blahblahblah@bronies.co.cc, but that's kind of confusing
If she was a pony, perhaps
6About Us is updated.
yeah, i wouldnt want to do it that way
in my opinion
6We'll discuss it further next week.
Enlighten me
blahblahblah@brony.co.cc

10"Ghosties: DO HO HO"

6They can.
Yeah, I can do that.
6Hence RainBorDash
D:
6We can just use !addmod
its ok.
I'll just change the script.
6And the function to remove it that I can never remember.
To go by whether someone has op/halfop
To base whether it kicks them or not.
But I may change my name a lot. I don't expect it to happen, but if Dari's way is much easier then I'd like to implement that

03yes
03well I'm using the Fixedsys font
03it's kinda borky about utf8 LOL
03there usedg to be Fixedsys Excelsior but it looks like complete crap on Windwos 7, that's basically an XP-only font XD
03the one that put the link to that jpb
03*jpg
nah, iy doesn't repond to colour
03oh
03but yeah Freyskol, as much as fixed-width fonts suck for most practical applications, I think it works really well for IRC
03fixedsys just looks the best to me, prolly because it's the mIRC default and changing it just looked weird to me
03o.o
03interesting XD
6</random>
03LOL
03well it was this ad on TV
03because real colleges don't advertise on MTV
6as to why they advertise...no idea
03there's probably over 9000 colleges by that na...what
6but it's a really good school
03well the commercial looked like it was a low budget thing
03but whatever you say LOL
/me 12hides
6yeah um, AI is extremely costly
6they're the most advertised school I know, doing every bit of marketing including high school visits
6there's a problem LOL
6although I think that literally IS a problem
6but tuition alone for a year is 25k
03dear lord
/me turns off MTV Hits
6I'm paying 23k a year at fullerton for tuition, housing, books, everything
03because it totally makes fun of people with bracdes etc :|}

12rawrrawr
12huh
03wtf is going on here o.o
03anyway bbl
12derp
<Drake> I'm angry.
03Glacymr
12hi
12sounds like sensitivity
03yes.
12then that blows that idea
03ever since I Got the filling
03I dunno if maybe they didn't do a good job of it and left some caviry intact :/
03*cafity
03*CAVITY
03God
12i have a filling that hurts whenever i drink something cold
12:/
03so that's normal? x.x
12no
12it shouldn't
6how long ago did you get the filling
03maybe 2 months?
12me, july 2nd
6thats not good
6you
03:/
03well
12agreed
6cold temperatures do that
6sugar shouldnt
03if I even touch it
03with my finger
03it hurts a little
6um
6get that checked
6it was miserable
12i'd get that checked too
6no
03it's like in the way back of my mouth, my toothbrush can't reach there
6he'd need a root canal first
6if a filling isn't done right, the cavity decays inward
6basically
6the tooth decays inside out
6it's horrible
/me cringes
I popped in at the wrong time
03hm
03yeah see
03when they drilled it
03it didn't even hurt
.-.
03and I didn't get novacaine either
6I had that for my first cavity
03LOL
03well
03supposedly it hurts
03for some people
03getting cavities drilled
03what kinda bugged me though
03is he gave me a novacaine shot for my other cavity
03and it didn't even kick into effect
03until after I left
03>_>
03so I leave there with a numb mouth and I'm like FFS
6lol
6sounds a lot like mine too
03so when I went back to get the second one drilled
6my second cavity, he gave me 3 shots before it kicked in, 15 minutes later
12XD
03but hm
03problem is my classes :/;
03and well
03if the cavity was still there
03would it hurt when I touch it like that?
6if it's getting inflamed yes
03hm
6the cavity is probably pressing up against the root, or the thin part of the tooth that's left
6which would in turn press against the root
03I mean, the two cavities I had, I never even felt anything
6the more that decays in there, the more root is exposed
03so this is odd :/
o_O
12Freyskol is thinking "forget this convo, i'm gonna play LoL'
Nah.
12WoW?
03EW WORLD OF WARCRACK
12why do people think it's addictive
12it's not
03because people waste their lives playing it
I'm thinking Romantic Children is a great song
eh
12i played it for like a month
12quit for 6 months, tried again for another month
after getting three characters to 85
12quit again, it's nothing special
nini all
12i'd probably play it
12if it was cheaper
12personally i don't think it's worth the 15 dollars a month
I wasn't paying for it
<.<
>.>
6lol
03even if it were free I wouldn't play it
12if it was free i'd toy with it
12i wouldn't play it
It's gonna die
:P
12then everything else is hate
Free MMO's are taking the market right now
6especially with games like dragon's nest coming out
03LOL
6that too

03I'm not obsessed or anything
03:|
03of course she was trying to get me to admit that earlier and I was like no
03no?
03hm
12nah, i don't see the traits of an obsession in drf
03as in
03the voice of Goliath in Gargoyles
03kinda an odd role for him XD
12the only obsession he has is the obsession of having to have everything high def and high quality digitally
03yeah, that's called quality wh*ring

No.....the difficulty is upped every time you kill a mech.
7Oh I see
Offtopic,but how come "My little Pony" becomes good,and "Transformers" becomes bad nowadays?
My fragile little mind does not comprend that.
7i've seen the movies with my bf though
The live-action ones?

Like:Customization,quests.
Dislike:Graphics,etc.
7graphics aren't that bad?
7it's just a bit comic / fantasy style
/me 7is pleased
Yea,i like comic/fantasy graphic style,it's just the graphics are blocky and stiff.
7blocky and stiff.. I agree the characters need an update.. but the world is simply amazing
/me 7is looking up some screenies

OHWELL, TIME FOR PONIES
10anyway
Aniway
um
just looking at erry line of code in the .swf rite now
MFW you're doing it wrong
Check thread for another hint.
oh?
haha
mfw> OH SHIT I DIDN'T PAUSE CORRECTLY
10ok dman, I have zero programming experience.
10;_______;
: /
10Reticent, wanna help us with a programming sentence.
MFW you're not half way through the puzzle yet.
...I have 3 years of Java experience, 1 in Python and 1 in C++
:P
lol...concatenation is nothing like adding, are we talking strings or integers?
10reticent, MFW I KNOW NOTHING.
well, are the numbers actual numbers or are they characters? like 'a' or 'Þ'
10fuck knows
yea that 'silver clue' was completely not understandable : /
ie should?
it should? *
well, I guess I'm involved now, someone post me a link
Then, with the other clues I've given you should be able to work it out.
^ THIS
^
also
But concatenate is actually a clue.
but concatenate was the clue
concatenate - Link (things) together in a chain or series
also: i clued the clue
MFW first time i've heard this word. ever.
yeah, it's like when you bring two strings together and it forms one or some shit
ALSO RETICENT U R NO HALP ;___________;
rundeepdown - i haven't got a clue
inb4 Probably, seeng as he actually has some coding experience ;_;
already got it dari
well, the way to get it
FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
where's a fucking pen when you need it
D_man: Wut?
10so brb
you solved prince-dari's code?
10ReticentSmolder there's no way i can be expected to solve it anyway
well yeah, i told you a few lines ago
really Dari, you could've made the cipher a bit harder
/trollface
Did he use Caesar Cypher?
I could've, but then it never would hve been solved.
wait wait wait
10D_man not really :P
Very easy coding.
Also, thunder.
MFW I should have used stegnographic encryption for files later on instead of just a simple password.
10well it's just another language
Do RSA encryption.
And it's moving south.
10ReticentSmolder I'm not doing the puzzle anymore :3 since it's made for you comp sci people to solve
in sheer comedy value
It's pretty simple to do now. :P
no it isn't >_<
asc...ii?
I dunno
yes? I dunno, gimme a sec, I was pretty sure I had something
for 10 minutes then they're crying
or you have?
yeah I just read the one in the link, I'm now looking through all of them
No.
oh...
I've told you how I've done the fileception.
I've told you where to look too. :P
whut

can't find anything

look at the images i put on the /chat/ thread please
02I'm trying to think lmao
Ok.
Look at thread.
I looked
Well, if you want. I wasn't thinking of it this time, haha.
Ahh,
Because I changed it.
oh?
bene
fine
is it 'netscape'?
Let me just check something. :)
D_Man umm which picture
flutterhi just all of mine on ponychan
/me can't find needed medication.
sigh
Maybe it changes it because it's a GIF?
flutterhi - one of the first ones
I dunno.
i think i'll hit up mcdonalds after i print my fanfic here
well download the ponychan pick AND CHECK please >_<
pic *
It works before I upload anyway.
before isn't the one we see : (
I can't think of anything, either.
Well, I could just upload the file to a different location.
:P
or that
ok I get it now
INB4 uploading it somewhere else breaks it too.
welp
shoulda thought this thru i guess ; (
why is that picture all the way at the top
which one?
I'm think it has to be because the image is a GIF or something.
Which is annoying.
yo
And ponychan breaks it.
>_>
send it to me via email
i have many pics flutterhi
and I'll post it to my site
I'm uploading it to mediafire.

Medal of Honor.
03like 10 pounds
03well
6...LOL
6wow
6thats a lot
MFW dman is wrong.
03and we wanted to do school colors
03which are blue and yellow
6ew
03$70 for 10 pounds in other words
6sounds like Gilroy High
6which was my rival high school
03but M&Ms made more sense to me
03since they're all just chocolat8e
03rather than conflicting flavors
03but those are like OBNOXIOUSLY expensive
6personalized M&Ms
03like $45 for 5lbs
6:D
03OK those
03cost $160 to get 10 pounds
03I actually checked
6wow
6nvm then
03yeah
03XD
03I mean

And Ubisoft considers it's DRM a success.
I don't have to be online to play SP.
Yeah.
07my sister got personalized Jones soda for her 18th bday =P
07now THAT was expensive
03I might see about going to this Eastern Market place in Detroit
Ubisoft's DRM is successful in lowering their sales.
6how do you personalize soda
07her picture on the label
03That's awesome
6lol
03how much did it cost though
6that's weird
I think i might go becom flutterHigh

thats wierd ;p
yeah
Fixed?
The binding shouldn't be an issue
And it would have tried linking and then spat out errors rather than timing out
72.20.16.202 is apparently not properly sending/receiving traffic
yeah
told ocean to use 72.20.16.201 when binding to island, that seemed to sort it right away
Great
Strange
not really, worked anyway ;p
once I get fibre from my ISP, I'll be decomissioning the server ocean is on, their network reliability is pretty poor ;p
it's unfortunate it's not as stable as their datacenters power, I had 3.3 years uptime at one point ;p
The 1000 day uptime? xD
I remember that
Nice o.O
Gotta bbl
Seeya
heh
one of my friend's VPSes
$17 per month, photonvps, xen server, has 8 cores
nice ;p
that's not bad at all
more linode though
nightshadow@legendary:~$ uptime
that's my leaseweb server
hasn't gone down since it was bought
linode has awesome support
sadly they have that IP policy now >:
likely because of ipv4 address exaustion ;p
Yeah
my ISP is great for that, I have 8 statuc from them ;p
statics*
o_O
IPv6 is easy to get atm
You have to tunnel it most of the time, though, and he.net's fremont datacenter sucks lol
indeedy, there's no shortage either
yeah
I think I still have two /64's and a /48 from he.net
I have a few
and some providers give free IPv6 IPs
I know vps247 give every customer a free /64 block
their uptime has been pretty bad though, although their network speed is decent
I don't know either
there'll*
yeah
IPv6 is starting to remind me of the way IPv4 went when it was first incepted
and when bots start to use it...
Heh?
Wasn't there :p
then there was much scrambling over trying to claw/reclaim/buy them back
or something
But heh, atm I'm like "grab the IPv6 while you can!"
I have quite a lot of blocks atm
was gonna put an IPv6 IP on island but universehosting is retarded and hasn't responded to my request for the free IPv6 IP they say they provide
pity, the ircd sometimes needs a little coaxing in regards to the config file when adding it, and needs to be compiled with ipv6 support
is it /24 or something? or still /8?
And yeah
it needs listen [ipv6IP]:port;
newer versions support things like [ipv6], but older are silly and request you puy all IPv4's in the form of ::ffff:<ipv4> or something similar
put*
it's pretty annoying
Yeah
I hate compiling with IPv6 support as well
Because it makes the link notices look like piles of unreadable crap
like anope's databases
okay, not that bad, but hopefully you get the gist
and yeah, that too x.x
need to dash sadly, I've got a bit of packing to do, leaving the country tomorrow for norway ;p
I need to sleep now anyway
I'll still be online semi-regurlarly while away incase anything explodes
Thanks, and sleep well ;p
