Filtered, homogenized "fun"
7to broadcast here yes
Nittany_Tiger, I totally thought you meant something else
oooooooooooh, you mean start my own room and get you guys in on it you mean?
Oh.
7yes
Yeah, I can do that.
although I have no idea how Veemi works :(
I'm playing Beat Hazard right now, so if you want to see me play BC2 tonight, I may be a while.
You know what the really fucked up thing in all this is? I actually see your point, I see where you're coming from but I just don't think it's fair to a good viewer to have to be quieted because of a few other assholes.
7I shall PM you ReticentSmolder_
03just bought my IRL friend Left 4 Dead (the first one) for 8 bucks
03so we can play together XD
there are plenty of places for them to discuss those things
6Ghosties, I know that feel, but unfortunately that's how modding tends to work.
but not everyone here likes it
new Fallout Equestria posted while I was gone? http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/original/130101172652.png
and we have to act in the best interests of everyone
How do we know what the viewer's best interests are?
We haven't asked them
i can safely assume that most of our viewers dont enjoy shitstorms over religion
Assume
02Off to watch something bbs
thats what we do
as mods
thats the job
What is this from?
Do you at least see why I'm so pissed, Hipster?
Do you see why I hate that rule?
I don't care what viewers think.
if we asked everyone about every decision we make, nothing would ever get done
Those topics are bad for discussion.
6Pocahontas
ffffuuuuu
ghosties: honestly, not really
At least you're honest
it sounds "freedom for the sake of freedom" to me
even when it isnt in the best interests of our viewers or the event
I suddenly crave some gold...
I hear "punishing all for the mistakes of the few"
but do you know what?
If I may add something?
What Sathi?
if the chat turns into a shitstorm, they're gonna be even more upset than they will be by not talking about it at all
of course sathi
For this entire discussion we have the last rule on the draft
I say put leave the drama outside
04o-o
Yes
Yes
I completely agree with that
;o
That's what I wanted to see
There is a news anchor on the network I am watching with a giant pair of scissors...
that is very open to misinterpretation though
Still it gives us freedom
You're assuming that people won't know what it means
to do what's right
You're assuming, and you're undermining our judgment
im assuming people will try and use it as a loophole
Hey, if, and I mean *IF* I can get a livestream of Silent Hill 2, would any of you guys want to see it?
er, not 2, the movie from 06
"oh i brought up cupcakes and derailed chat with it, but i wasnt TRYING to stat drama"
start*
That's an obvious troll, you kick his ass. If you can't see a fucking troll, then why mod?
We need to agree on these rules as a team
I have seen it a good bit, but I might watch it I can never seem to catch the first half-hour.
That statement of the rule grossly undermines our abilities to appropriately judge and rule
yeah, I'm seeing if I can fiddle with livestream stuff, I don't know how to make it NOT my entire monitor hehe
its for the sake of clarity
It feels like you are telling me "I don't trust your ability to mod, therefore, I'm going to tell you what to look for"
7get the program
Well...that won't be to terrible as long as you use a player with full screen options
no, thats not what im saying at all
7you can choose what to view and what not
That's honestly how it comes off to me
its for the viewers
7even can zoom in and what not
i give those as examples of topics to avoid because they ALWAYS turn into shitstorms
...
no u
ohai dari
6Try "Please leave all drama at the door. This is intended to be a fun and inclusive event, so please avoid the discussion of controversial topics such as politics, religion, "Cupcakes", furries, and other topics not mentioned here."
whats with egg face anyway?
My router exploded.
nah
XD
I like Sathi's better
too much info
keep it simple
KiS
/me plays Mario party 2
>mfw thats pretty much exactly what i wrote
Egg...face...egg-face...egg face...eggface?
It really is what Hipster wrote
yep ;)
You just left out a line
6I took out some to make it seem less strict.
6It's the same basic idea though.
Sathi's wording is best
i want to give examples so people know what we're talking about
It gets the point across
Then just leave Cupcakes
It relates to the fandom, after all
then it looks like we're singling out Cupcakes though
But it's still an example
And it relates to the fandom
7I missed... that pic
03Frick I lost this minigame >_>
It tells them "leave the drama at the door"
And really
It's almost always about cupcakes
only half of them have been about cupcakes, from what i remember
Then here it is again:http://www.webguild.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/egg_face_google.jpg
INSTANT REPLAY
I've only ever seen people tell others to stop talking about Cupcakes
7thank you!
lol
you got the power!?!?!
7I do?
there was one about furries before for sure
yes
one about religion (during monty python IIRC)
Like I said, it's an example, it gets the point across, it's relateable, and it makes up for most of the controversial topics that I've seen discussed; it's a good example
the power of frienship
imho try to keep the rules simple and easy to read.. no need to use examples for everything
but like i said, then it looks like we're singling out Cupcakes
if people have questions they will ask
and people will assume it's a "dont talk about Cupcakes" rule
IMO, I'd rather single out Cupcakes then religion or politics
also the power of op-ness now. Congrats to you and rainbro!
and forget that it includes other things
if we list multiple things, it doesnt single them out though
Then keep it related to the fandom
7hihi thanks
I forgot to say it earlier when it was announced...
Enlighten me of this mystical op...
12Heya Aurora
Things that relate to our demographic
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYX1HzRiIpM
mod
basically. half-op's can't ban i think? and full operators can.
hi
7it means I have the "banhammer"
Ah, operator
7*swings around with it*
and admin is one step above that.
7see?
/me gets hit.
/me Ducks under the hammer
ow
hi rora
how does one emote?
/me 7runs to Polarfire and hugs him tight
type: /me
!pokemon
Kosoveon, you are a 7Hitmontop.
/me destroys the universe
thanks sathi :D
7will you rebuild it?
I can only destroy
!pokemon
Aurora, you are a 4Rapidash.
6k
blah
7My mother always told me.. whatever you destroy needs to be rebuild
12!Pokemon
03LOL I hate when the CPU players use items like the lamp that takes you to the star
your mother lied
12:3
CUTIE MARK CRUSADER UNIVERSE BUILDERS GO!
03LOL Turdwig
XD
oh shoot
I am sorry, I saw the opening and went for it
Hah
this song
... we're screwed
MUAHAHAHA
problem is though, conversation doesnt always stay limited to the fandom
I'm supposed to be doing something for school right now... fcuk der poleic.
:P
perhaps I can help
FUCK DA....lost my train of thought
ha.
I know it doesn't, but if we put up examples that relate to the fandom that cause drama then it doesn't single out one particular thing, it's multiple examples, and it gets the point across to not stir shit up
/me flings himself off a cliff
who plays this song?
sprinkles apparently.
no imean teh artist
oh.
/me yells, his voice almost being lost in the wind, "WEEEEEEE, THIS IS AWESOME!"
ok, name another controversial part of the fandom we're going to ban
nooo!
the acid polka has arrived
/me runs to the edge of the cliff with a fishing pole
/me casts over the edge hoping to catch DE
Syrup
pony menstruation blood
/me lands in the water, after doing a perfect swan dive, then is pulled out by Polarfire.
thats not controversial though, just gross and kind of funny
igotchabro
i wouldnt want to ban it tbh
And Cupcakes is also "gross" and "kind of funny"
Dammit Polar! I was just cliff diving!
You got him alright. Looks like the hook went right through his cheek.
oh.
/me cuts line
I guess you....
/me puts on sunglasses
>mfw cupcakes is kind of funny
its very offensive to a lot of people though
o god...
It really is
funny, that is
myself included
get out :P
took my red herring
Why is it offensive? Because it's gore?
YEEEEAAAAH
*facehoof*
Syrup is goddamn pony menstruation blood for fuck's sakes
ghosties, a large population of the fanbase HATES cupcakes
That's okay, but gore isn't?
Dammit, I fucked up my grammar on that line....
i dont know of anyone that HATES syrup
Oh well.
Morning
hate=/=controversial though
People hate Hitler
Our hate of Hitler is not controversial
6Um... it kinda is Ghosties.
Dude, are you telling me I can't hate Hitler?
and godwins law has been fulfilled now
6Not at all.
That's another thing, I liked Hitler in here
He was funny
hey, you know that part about me...and the Silent Hill movie, and me streaming it? its true
evening
NO WAY!
GIBT MIR DIEN LINK
7with help :P
Look, Hipster, you can try to act however you want, all I'm saying is, just don't include religion and politics. It's assuming, insulting, and I feel like it undermines the mods abilities. Most importantly, it's just so restrictive.
Everypony chill the fuck out, im still alive!
yes, with much help, I dunno if I'm allowed to use this chat room or not? anywho, I can pm anyone who wants to link
OH OGD IM SO RELIEVED
I am asking you as a person
From one person to another
Don't include it, please
/me pokes ClockworkPie with a stick, just to be sure.
oww~
no way
7use the PM's pls ;)
/me pokes ClockworkPie again.
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hNQwbALMqTo/TjRsXnlLQDI/AAAAAAAAJfE/EUrK0PRYtuE/s1600/Clipboard01.jpg <- Why do I want this? oO;
owww~, pls stop it hurts
To be your inner female
/me nods
12ogawd
/me backs away, slowly...
/me 12mind asploded
>mfw putting in a rule about not causing drama started a ton of drama
so umm, if you wanna see silent hill, (unofficially and all), I can pm you the link to me stream
reticentSmolder_ I'll check it out if you don't mind.
thats right ya better back away
I once read on some spirtual site somewhere that everyone has a male and female soul within him/her
problem is ghosties, those are the two most divisive topics out there
/me quietly loads his revolver.
if that's true I think the female part of my soul is... expressive
nothing good can come from having discussion of them
Just in case....
I just can't believe you don't see the problem with it
O.o
/me starts to panic
oj no
/me 12would want it too tho X3
/me sees a wild ClockworkPie appear!
I feel like you don't even see where I'm coming from
/me uses tackle
i honestly and truly dont, and heres why:
/me is hit by tackle. Its not very effective...
/me uses revolver!
I discussed the rule with a friend a moment ago and he said this. i better stfu about things that kill fun for others.
6too pink
6otherwise yes
we are trying to keep people from bringing up divisive topics, to keep chat from turning into a shitstorm
You're trying to herd them into being cattle
/me is shot by revolver, its super effective
so um, yeah, #Silent_Hill is up for people who like free movies
/me throws a ponyball!
politics and religion are perfect examples of topics NOT to bring up
/me faints ;_;
/me catches ClockworkPie in the ponyball!
/me is now in a ponyball
XD
Do you even think like a regular user, Hipster?
dammit ghosties, you arent even listening to me
/me asks himself, "Now what do I do with this...?"
all it takes is a handful of people to ruin the entire event
I fucking hear you, but you can't see what I'm trying to tell you
hi Kosoveo
/me faints!
n
fu
and then guess what, people stop coming
o-o
I fucking get that it can cause a shit storm
I fucking get it
well excuse me
nooo master
/me shot
6lol
/me has no more ponymon! He loses the battle!
I understand that it can cause drama to stir up, I know. Religion and politics do that
then why is this such an issue?
Hmm...I want to test something
its bad for the event, therefore, we're not doing it
Back
But you don't seem to see that telling people to not talk about religion or politics is basically saying that you can't talk about anything that's not safe
You are labeling these people
You come back into chat while you're in the shower?
O:
Because god fucking forbid anyone ever talks about anything that isn't safe
Next we won't be able to talk about sex
Lol, I just told it to change my name but it didn't
you know what, we cant all be idealists
|D
I'm the idealist?
Damn, I can't do /(Someone else's name)
?
patty's hardcore
im trying to run a successful event here, not trying to uphold some grand vision of freedom of speech
Dude, you're on fucking Ponychan all the goddamn time on meta giving out sage advice to people
D:
:P
Gah, stupid client
/me shrugs.
6Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand now we're just arguing. Which means you both need to chill for a second. So please do while I respectfully voice my opinion.
Won't let me ghost my name
7nope :)
/me 's computer engineering knowledge has no effect!
lol
what client
Pattyrick|shower used an unknown command
6Ghosties, it takes only one person to ruin everything for everypony. And since you're so keen on thinking about the viewers, think about a new viewer coming to the stream for the first time and running into a shitstorm? Would you want to come back?
IRC999
There
Duh
Of course it's stupid
Hi Zoroark
Use a real client like mibbit
Yeah, my father was (and still is) a computer engineer. He was the head of the various departments over several companies
6Hipster, you don't need to have examples in the rules. Everypony will know to behave themselves, and if they don't that's where we do our job as mods and ask them to stop.
...you have a point, Sprinkles.
They have iPod app?
cool
< App
sprinkles, the reason i want examples is so we have clarity
< Failure
Nope
Use the terrible browser that is included
Or use a computer :P
Fuck.
6The clarity will come forward very quickly as soon as anypony sees a single warning.
Stupid channel modes disappearing.
Forget BC2. I'm too out of it to do well.
Bad internet connection
?
otherwise we're going to get a million questions about "is X considered a controversial topic?"
Whoops
For my PC
Wrong channel.
6We'll still get them anyway.
Move the PC? :P
As amusing as that is
+e?
wat
6It's part of our job as a mod to deal with those questions.
As amusing as that is
Exactly, we are the complaint guys after all
6+e is exempt from the ban on everything.
I had my volume allll the way up
Got any grapes?
ah
GOT ANY NAILS?
Why should I need to do that? It worked before but for the past few days it's been acting up
but sprinkles, what im saying is we can avoid some of those questions by giving examples in thefirst place
FIRST, YOU MUST BRING ME....A SHRUBBERY
the first*
Hiya.
I'm sad that I can't hang around here during the week. Also, my phone doesn't like connecting to this server.
But we're the complaint guys, if the viewers have questions then they can just come to us
So we don't need to listen to you complain about IRC66-999?
were you telling the duck joke?
Yeah.
exactly
Tells me to replace my ethernet cable on my router (which has been working for a long time)
ohhhh shit
6However, Hipster, we'll still get questions about what qualifies as political, religious, etc.
nice
Lol, I didn't complain
and you guys can explain then
That's right
>real client
>mibbit
/me scratches his head, slightly confused yet again.
22:53] <Pattyrick|shower> Gah, stupid client
[22:53] <Pattyrick|shower> Won't let me ghost my name < Complaint
Well yes Zoroark
I just said that it wouldn't let me use the GHOST command
haha, what
Seems like a complaint
well, i still think we should have examples, but im clearly in the minority, so we'll go with no examples
Mibbit is a real client compared to IRC999
No, statement, not complaint :P
I guess computer knowledge comes in like a wave.
Pattyrick which IRC client are you using?
IRC999
It's the reason why we decided to implement mods as complaint people. If they have questions, then they come to us and we handle it
You can never start learning everything at once.
oO
Never heard of this one
Use Mibbit
yeah i haven't either
or better, download mIRC if you can
/me is gonna play some OoT tonight
Same
On my iPod?
Only iTards use it
get colloquy
meh, for the millionth time i'll try to beat fire temple
.-.
02Hmm
02that was pretty cool
if you're on your ipod :V
i never had too many problems with colloquy
SO WHY EXACTLY WOULD A CAT SHAPED LIKE A POPTART EVEN WANT TO BE HURLING THROUGH SPACE totally unrealistic says this twittering feline
6I have no problem with using examples, however they should be examples that are easily defined. Political and religious discussion is hard to define as what would be allowed and what would not. Whereas Cupcakes is easy to define, and is simply not allowed.
Colloquy is worth the money I say
the only problem was that it crashed after a while due to not deleting logs after a while
/me hides
I have mIRC on my PC, but its internet sucks and I'm using my iPod instead
but it's my fault for idling in channels with lots of activity
Pattyrick try downloading Colloquy for the iOS
I can probably get it for free
okay, but we cant do ONLY cupcakes though
Ok
Brb
6I understand this.
because people will think it means ONLY cupcakes
7I'm blonde... I have my bf for computer knowledge if I need it :P
How about Syrup
syrup isnt a divisive topic though
Syrup is disgusting
6Syrup is not as highly controversial.
throw me some comp knowledge, cuz I'm so retarded
No one wants to talk about pony menstruation blood
6And we have allowed discussion on that front in the past.
ive never seen a shitstorm start over syrup
...do they?
It's worth the USD$1.99
ewww..
what the...
first time I heard of that...
:S
sathi: ponychan meme
See
hi J
Sathi thinks it's disgusting
6It's one of those things that we allowed based on what was being talked about.
(There wouldn't even be a need for half of the 'apps' if some lazy company added a proper browser and OS to their tablet)
6It's not as set in stone controversial as Cupcakes.
6Which means we need something that is.
its gross, but its not something that is going to turn the chat into a shitstorm
hi Kos
6Exactly.
What else is considered controversial in the fandom?
which is what im concerned with
Well, at least the Wii supports Mibbit and Youtube out of the box :P
can we talk about networking?
thats what im saying though
And we all know how underpowered the Wii is
I just moved an entire office to a new location
Look, as far as I'm concerned, we can just answer those questions. We leave cupcakes as the example
cupcakes is pretty much the only thing in the fandom thats highly divisive
6I honestly say we should attempt to limit the "soandso is best pony" talk, but that's just me.
/me RUNS
So we get more questions about what's controversial, it's our job as mods
and I have Local Area Networks on the brain man
i've used mibbit on my iPod
When I had one that is
naw sprinkles, those topics can be fun
6...I have yet to have a fun one.
I used Mibbit on my iPhone as well
6Ever.
and they usually dont end in anyone getting upset
A bit wonky
6Wrong again.
So I downloaded Colloquy
You'd be surprised...
Terrible :P
colloquy's the best IRC client yeah
on iOS that is
>mfw ive never gotten upset during a best pony conversation
that and port fotwarding.... so. much. port. forwarding.
I just got it, let me switch to it
Those conversations are funny.
I'm gonna say that the title goes to Linkinus
dari, you banned soipony
People don't tend to argue.
...
for disliking rd
Wut?
exept for the fact you gotta pay for the sucker
12oww ;-;
Oh.
6That's because your favorite pony is Rainbow, and most ponies agree with you.
That's just trolling though.
I unbanned him straight away.
I could call up my father...but I think he is in china right now...
that was a silly thing though
And even IF it was just trolling, some viewers may not have saw it that way
Lawl, I trollban people all the time.
Let me check
No one cares.
6When your favorite pony is one of the ones that isn't as popular, it gets very offensive very quickly.
just ask dari.
what's wrong glacy? :(
7Aye ask Dari
he's a genius.
i kick people for talking shit about RD all the time, i never do it from a place of anger though
No one argues anyway?
nope.avi
The conversations just go like this:
X is best pony
12i took a shower
I say leave Cupcakes as the example. We can just answer any questions otherwise
6Again, just my personal opinion.
12and got shampoo in my eye
thats not how you spell X pony
^
Yikes
that happens to me every time
I'd definitely say include religion and politics in the rules.
6I say we not have an example for the moment, and should a second one comes up we simply add it and Cupcakes to the rules.
but ghosties, do you see why we cant just leave it at cupcakes?
That sounds fair, Sprinkles
Ask me what?
12then close your eyes? XD
12i don't know how it happened
7it's alive!
Yeah, he's still in china
Do you see why it's oppressive to include religion and politics?
12i was shampooing my head
7*giggles*
doesn't help much
shampoo is really tricky
Haha, Sathi. XD
no, i dont, since theyre more or less going to be against the rules anyway
12my eyes were closed the entire time then i started wiping my face off with a wash cloth to get the soap off my eyes like i always do, my eyes were still closed and it somehow happened
...
Dari, I need your help
FUCKING TAB BUTTON
ASDIOPGAOPWDJFGPAOJKWEPKOAQWERGKOP
pwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwease?
fukken capped
heres an example:
/me shrugs
eh, not going to give an example unless you want me to
also.. we have tools for shitstorms +m channel for instance
Are you using FME?
6Example of something that would be against the rules if religion and politics is left in the rules but would still be okay imo: The talking about greek mythology symbolism in Rainbow.
...no?
sathi: once they begin, they dont stop easily
Hmmm
I rarely get shampoo in my eyes
But we've stopped it, Hip
ho do I shot web?
We always have
10lolol
Maybe because you rarely shampoo?
we stopped it before it turned into a shitstorm though
6Hipster, that's what +m and kicks/bans are for.
well no matter how many times I try I always get at least a little shampoo in my eyes
once its in progress, its much harder
I just tilt my head forwards or back when washing the shampoo off, until they are rinsed off
6And again, we have to do our jobs as mods.
even if I close them or I was the shampoo off quickly
And again, it sounds like you don't trust our abilities to kick and mod appropriately
*was
*WASH
6If it comes to that it comes to that.
That's how it sounds
I shampoo everyday, good sir.
ummm, SoundMax? I'm just choosing the software my speakers use but I guess I'm not using any software
lol live stream is such a ram gobler
calm yourself Kos
no ghosties
and wb Pat
That's how it comes off
yeah you're really one to tell me to calm myself :P
Yay, it works
@FlutterHi yeah it is, but its free
People get pissed off when those topics come up.
im confident in all of our abilities to mod
but
I agree with Hipster completely.
Thanks Aero
Good
12o-o
Then you should be able to trust uis
*us
...What stream site are you using?
once 200 people start talking about it, a mute and a warning isnt going to stop it
I got it free because mine is jailbroken and I have Installeous :P
I'm using Livestream, and their client Procaster
and a banning spree is just going to get people angry
also aero
Why'd you jailbreak it
Kos?
6And yet we have a rule about that kind of thing anyway.
if you are a potato why don't you die already :|
Hipster, have we EVER had 200 people causing a shit storm? No, we always containt
*contain it
lol pirating apps on iOS
D:
nuuuuuu
video works fine, but audio is apparently fucked up
6It's our job to contain it BEFORE it happens.
Exactly
We're mods
ghosties, thats what the rule is for, as i have said multiple times
to stop it BEFORE it happens
But we always have stopped it before it happens
6Hipster, that's why we just don't put in ANY examples.
Because jailbreaking it allows me to do awesome stuff, and you know it xD
6We have a failsafe in our disclaimer.
Hmm, I've never used that site.
Or procaster.
Why couldn't you do that awesome stuff in the first place? :o
7I use it frequently ..but without music.. just drawing stuff
And, if I need to get rid of it, I just update
7or sounds*
Livestream is sorta nice. It gets the job done?
http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/palemale-store_2170_1135405
7yes
yeah, the video works fine, but I just can't get my sound captured
7I can even zoom into the tools I use
Because Apple made sure that pirates couldn't destroy them
I heard that you could hear my music faintly but it had static
Yet their store prices are ridiculously cheap, or so I've heard
hey
But I'm not a complete pirate; I only get some apps for free and do basic changes
They are
But just for the sake of having stuff for free :P
Ironic
he's not going to know he's unbanned though
the problem there is people could just decide not to bring up any topic that they think might cause ANY disagreement
Mmmhmmm

>Not bothered :P

03:|
Ok
he's trolling ;)
I was kidding
Will do
we have the chat logs, don't try and deny it
6I think we got them all.
i thought there was something you brought up ghosties
rainbro is huge pedo
and I was also talking about the minecraft creeper
that got lost in the shuffle over that last rule
Like the number of kicks and warnings?
Bye
2problem, rainbordash?
Or the trolling bit?
STARLIT :DX
:D*
no, i think we agreed on that
ah
03inb4 awkward greetings

thats it i think
Uh
Lemme think
/me 12smiles
Wait...if you already knew what 34 was...WHO ARE YOU!?
...I forgot -___________-
How are you today :3
alrighty then
10is best mod
12script kitteis are n00bs
All I can remember is that if someone is outright trolling to kick them and then if they continue, ban them
Some 4channer no doubt
AHA!
hahahaha
I knew it!
well, obvious trolls im just going to ban straight away
>mfw he's in the dark
my boi
That makes sense
you showed rule 34 to a 10 year old?
they can appeal if we banned them incorrectly
your sick
xD
Do we have that in the rules? That they can appeal?
12Good.
12Watchin' Glee.
yeah
Question
12And Doctor who
I am seriously doubting problem is 10
What episode
Alright
Lol multitasking
IMPORTANT: If you receive a ban, it is ALWAYS permanent unless you appeal. To appeal, use the command “/join #BronyStateAppeals”. Here, you will meet with the mod staff and explain why you should be allowed to return to Brony State. After we have heard your appeal, we will decide the length of your ban. DO NOT join the #BronyStateAppeals channel unless yo
is the questions and concerns job added to the new team yet?
12Hm...
So far he's shown us he knows of the tri-force
12Original Song
RainBro is talking on Skype, he's avoiding talking to us.
yeah, i bet he is some faggot loser from 4chan
dammit mibbit
BWAHAHAHA XD
GIVE ME HIS SKYPE
Uh, I think Sprinkles was gonna add it to our duties?
12I've had "Loser Like Me" in my head for five. Days.
cut off the last part
And yeah, that looks fine, Hip
I WILL CONFRONT HIM
WHOA, NEW TEXT FONT
but yeah, you get where the last part is going
oh god glee
/me mauled
03EW GLEE
6I don't want to add anything more to the duties than necessary...
But yeah...I think problem is more along the lines of 15-17
Glee is meh
XD
03they basically destroy good songs
6And yeah, Ghosties, the font randomly changed for no reason.
Yeah
Well, we should make it clear to the users that if they have questions or concern to know which mods to go to
12@drf they made Friday amazing.
Like Safety Dance ;.;
/me runs
he could be like 30
6It's in the rules.
lol Starlit
Ah, alright
NOTHING can make Friday amazing
6At the very end of it.
NOTHING
I suppose, but the older you get, the less trolling appeals to you
12>:D
mib_4kkpeb and mib_pmkj3m are the same person, lol.
12/f/ca
Not the current rules, is it?
Glee's attempt was rubbish
12How about "my moment"?
6No, the ones that are being written.
DONT GIVE ME THAT
also, we need to update the history section on the about us page
lol
6I know Hipster.
that song was, meh ok
everything is a lie
what the fuck
im back bitches
6I'll have it done prior to next week.
problem, YOU LIE
not only does it not mention RBD or Sathi getting hired, but it doesnt mention peanut either XD
lie about what
6Just need to know what we'd like put in there, really.
problem, lol
6Eyup.
/me slams his head against his desk repeatedly.
hey faggot
6That's because Peanut wasn't on the list when Silver made the site.
AAAGGHHH
BTW, the bit about users going to me, Hipster, or Sprinkles will be in the revision yep?
STFU
D:
problem?
Keine lust!
so i heard ponies is gay
So...I heard you were homosexual
ohrly?
Well guys this is it for me.. I'm going to bed.. Hope you enjoyed my suggestions / feedback.. I'll see you all soon again
dari, newspaper?

12Hang on, I'll be back.

Indeed, we did. Have a good night, Sathi
/me 12jumps in TARDIS
6Is all we want updated just those names put in that paragraph?
12Time machine. I has one.
6Because I can frankly do that now.
/me hugs notproblem
coming from a pony fag
yeah, for now
lawl

heres something we should consider
It's just a normal hug.
7Goodnight people i'm off to bed

night sathi
Night Sathi
Cya.
:)
when are they showing inception?
o.o
that movie sucks
just curious bro
I could always do this, which is completely random.
/me explodes.
Silly notproblem! That is not how trolling works!
RarityIsBest: It's on Friday at 7pm EST
hmm can you teach me?
you know how you can get email addresses with a "company name" or whatever at the end?
not today? :/
~yay~
is there a way we can do that for free?
what're they showing later
so we can have site emails for brony state business?
Yeah.
you know what i mean?
I think.
So...
6I'm sure there is.
Trolls gone, now what?
So sort of blahblahblah@bronystate.co.cc?
@pony best troll pony
6 best troll pony is 5Snai10ls
like mine would be HipsterBrony@bronystate.com or w/e
BAM
So true
or yeah, something like that
Lol.
There's something like 5 free emails with the free domain.
hmmmm
well
6Not exactly enough of them.
we can do me sprinkles and ghosties for complaints, and one that we can all access maybe
6I'll look in to it, see what I can find by next week.
like how we have the bronystate gmail account now
so gilda is best pony
Sounds good
We could get 2 domains just for emails or something.
You might be onto something.
Oh, look, I spoke too soon
So blahblahblah@brony.co.cc
And then blahblahblah@bronies.co.cc, but that's kind of confusing
If she was a pony, perhaps
spoke too soon about what
6About Us is updated.
you know what sight sucks major dick is ponychan
6And like I said, I'll see what I can find out about it.
yeah, i wouldnt want to do it that way
in my opinion
6We'll discuss it further next week.
Enlighten me
That's what I want
blahblahblah@brony.co.cc
too many tripfags
...I'm kidding >_<
Define this term you use.
it would be nice to have set up before we move over to the new site though
tripcode fags
Meh
brb
no!
MUAHAHAHA
6Again, I'm going to look into it to see what can be done about it.
tripcode?
4umad?
Alright, well, are the rules done? Can we see what it looks like, Hip?
/me bites Cube
12bbl
12kk
And the bass keeps runnin' runnin'
/me explodes
6...I'm getting seriously sick of this guy.
Okay...
How long ago did I get kicked? O.o
me too sprinkles.
Who are we sick of?
6Aww... is he too afraid to talk?
@Dashite I think it was a mistake in typing
umad bro?
You know what I love
4Colors
But we are currently mad at some~I spoke too soon
1 sec
Okay
4*claps*
http://mibpaste.com/OibLsS
thanks sprinkles.
/me claps.
We appreciate it.
Although I was kinda having fun counter-trolling him
Question
Do we ever kick anymore?
6Yeah.
if your counter trolling he's already done his job as a troll
It seems like with the recent "one warning, then ban" bit that kicking is just obsolete
i kick all the time
/me says over the radio "*Kzzzt* Counter-trollerists win. *Kzzzt*"
Well, I mean, obviously to troll the viewers
not just for trolling either
Meh, I dont do it to rid myself of him
lol now I wanna play CSS
So, is kick ever used as an actual tool of modding?
MY EVIL KNOWS NO BOUNDS
6I just let that troll get kicked three times before I banned him, dude.
yes
Cascade Style Sheet?
:P
i use it as a final warning before a ban
Problem is, I have no idea who kicked him
10"Ghosties: DO HO HO"
dari did i think
6Dari did three times, and then RainBro
Speaking of, dari should really change the script so that mods can nick change and still keep mod powers
6They can.
Yeah, I can do that.
4Dat's mah catchprase
gah, I give up, I'm just gonna watch Silent Hill solo, stupid livestream audio...
6Hence RainBorDash
He means so the colours script doesn't kick
D:
Yeah, that's what I mean
well, I would share but it'd be a silent movie
6We can just use !addmod
its ok.
I'll just change the script.
I keep forgetting what CSS means as far as computers so.
6And the function to remove it that I can never remember.
/me salutes ReticentSmolder for his braveness.
To go by whether someone has op/halfop
To base whether it kicks them or not.
But I may change my name a lot. I don't expect it to happen, but if Dari's way is much easier then I'd like to implement that
10DUDE
10RIDE HORSES
10THEY'RE FASTER
!?
10AND BRAVEER
night all
unless anyone knows how to set up Livestream audio
WHAT ARE YOU RUNNING YOUR MOUTH ABOUT!?
6Well, I'm kinda glad I got to feed Anna today.
AAAAGGGHH
Sprinkles: Is Anna the name of someone you keep in your cellar?
@SirSprinkles Who is Anna if you don't mind me asking?
6Anna is the name of my banhammer.
lol
Ahh.
lol
6I named her back during the mini raid, remember?
XD
I missed this raid.
mini raid?
enlighten me.
^
6It was like, two guys with dynamic IPs.
/me grabs popcorn
6I put area bans on them. XD
/me steals some of Polarfire's popcorn.
hmm.
off to google dynamic ip's.
Where they trolling?
/me gives the rest of the popcorn to DE.
Dynamic IP's are basically changing IP addresses
They change constantly
Making them hard to ban
oh.
/me takes popcorn back.
6Hard to ban anywhere that can't use area bans.
6But IRC clients can area ban.
lol.
6Which makes them easy to get rid of.
IRC clients have excepts too.
So you can allow people banned by area bans to get in anyway.
On an individual basis.
10+e :3
?
Don't you already have op?
and weren't you already here?
XD
OH MY GOD!
oh desh.
nevermind.
PANIC!

/me Zombie hands begin feeling in the gaps around the door
/me ominous moaning continues
12Meowing Lugia = THE END OF THE WORLD!!!!

Good idea
/me is blasted up out of the bunker by the explosive force

/me retreats through the back door
/me runs across the field on the other side.
/me Suddenly a balloon appears on the horizon
/me is creeped out atm from listening to apparant Bigfoot calls
/me It lands beside zombie polarfire
/me uses his signaling mirror to contact the balloon's operator.
/me The operator opens fire on DE
Probably just old people having sex.
03LOL
/me runs to avoid the traser rounds.
Balloon Operator: Get in quick!

*the parasprites eat the rest of Polarfire's zombie horde.
/me trains guard dogs.

/me sprints to the control panel and begins flipping switches.
FOR THE POPCORN OF FUTURE GENERATIONS!!!
CHAAAAARRRGE!!!!!
/me pulls the switch for the attack dogs
/me Parasprites begin to swarp out of the cave, headed straight for DE's bunker.
/me They will be there within minutes.

/me waits and watches his monitors
/me begins changing the settings on the reactor
/me By the time all the parasprites have left the cave, they form huge clouds in the sky and block out the sun
/me Opens the emergency toxins valve.
What exactly happens in australia anyways?
/me The first of the parasprite scouts encounter DE's dogs

/me Parasprites begin to choke in the gas, but it appears they have found the fresh air vent.
/me The parasprites begin to enter through the vent, ignoring the gas chambers
/me sees that the sprites have reached the air vent and detonates the thermite grenades, destroying the control panels in the room.
/me runs out of the room deeper into the mine.
/me sees the explosion from afar
GO GO MY ARMY
HE IS WEAK
/me reaches the fallback control room
/me bolts the door shut and toggles fuel intake to maximum.
/me Parasprites search through the rubble and find the hole DE escaped through
03http://www.bfro.net/avevid/mjm/Howl.mp3

/me Runs from the room to the central chamber
12i got some shampoo in my eye when i was showering
12and my eye hasn't been the same since
Sober is alright, but that buzz is nice
Maybe it's a werewolf.
/me begins to wonder just how big that damn underground bunker is

/me looks on the monitors, enjoying the dramatic irony.
/me runs
/me The parasprites continue to move earth, trees, rocks, rubble, and whatever else they can find onto the openings of DE's half-collapsed shelter.
/me sits down.
/me presses a button on his chair.
/me waits. From under the chair, metal begins to fold up around it.
/me Thinks DE is now buried and orders the sprites to stop.
/me presses a second button, then types telemetry into a computer. A massive hole opens in the ground on the surface
07well they're not.

07because SOMEONE lives in the FUTURE
07>|

THIS CAN'T BE!!
Alright.
That is IT.
/me looks through the rear monitor as the bunker's reactor goes critical.
/me teleports, leaving the parasprites behind
/me dials a number.
/me watches a mushroom bloom from the uranium mine.
Hello?
hello
Look up
haha
coooome on Kyu D:
what?? wrong number.
I would be scared truly if Joker or Batman joined team rocket
/me dials a DIFFERENT number.
/me presses a button on the control panel
no one on here has beaten me yet >:
07lol
or at least no one that I've went against
/me watches the monitors with a smile as its white cargo spills from the cargo bay
most inventive minds in the DC comics, but most inventive of all has to be Tony or Howard Stark, or even Norman Osborne
Hello? yeah Luna listen. I'm calling in a solid you owe me......
/me is sure glad luna is willing to lease him a place on the moon
Though Crimson Dynamo is pretty good as well
/me continues to watch as pure POPCORN spills down to the earth...
/me is sure glad she let him rig the place with explosives before DE got there
Modok as well
/me notices the popcorn.
GAAAHHHH
/me lands on the moon
I'll GET YOU ONE DAY DE! ONE DAAAAAYYY!!!!!!!!
/me is engulfed in popcorn
/me exits his rocket and clips the wires on the C4 around his new pad.
/me detonates the lunar explosives
/me wonders if Polarfire enjoyed his popcorn...
/me but... they've failed!
good thing I got.... BACKUPS
/me laughs as a fizzle emits from the disabled detonated of the C4
Deathstrooooooooooooke
/me detonates backup explosives
crap...
Hmm...that was weird
/me wonders if he put the explosives in the right place??
oh well.
/me closes the fan fiction and announces, "And that's how equestrian was made!"
maybe
Good RP dude. That was fun.
but the best I have to give to Dr. Doom
*the group of fillies around Denied_existence applaud*
yeah! awesome!
Anyway, I need some sleep. I will probably be part of the panel of TheBronyShow on monday...so catch me then if I am!
oh thats awesome! how'd you get that?
Well...its not for sure yet...but the key is kindness, interest, and thankfulness.
ah. That usually works. :)
Well night. I'll cya then
I hope I will see me, and you, too! Night!
Alright. Who all sat through that?

Sooner or later, homeless people will evolve into turtle hybrids, like nomads or something.
Walking around, with the box on their back.

hey dari
Yeah?
how did you make a script that shows EQD updates?
lol
Sockets.
sockets?
I dunno what those are but I'm really impressed.
thats amazing.
Open up a connection to EQD using a socket, receive the source code of the page.
Then search the line till I get what I'm looking for.
In this case the first title it comes accross.
Since this will be the latest post.
Then post that in chat.
so are the posts automatic or manual?
The "New EQD post: asdf" thing is automatic.
!digimon
I've got a timer set up to open a socket to EQD every 30 seconds.
/me is amazed
So the script checks every 30 seconds.
dude you are a computer god.
I used to think sockets were hard.
/me bows
But I found something that explained them well.
And gave examples of how they work, etc.
So I can understand them now.
and also Varodurumon
Did you learn everything you know from the internet?
Well, the internet is one large part, and just experimenting with coding is good too.
Double failure all the way across the chat
Oh
Wow
Oh my God
Look at that failure
We would, but then we would be looking at you, and who wants to see that?
What
bbl soon anyway
Need to buy a new electric shaver

6yes
04|D
04Yay learning more about Autodesk Maya
04Gonna probably learn a loot about it tomorrow
03WTF is wrong with Katy Perry's music videos, they're always stretched out on MTV and such
03I thought it was just that one video, but this one's doing thes ame thing
and you cant have improvement without improv
haha, just had a hilarious challenge cup battle against Kyu
:P
o.o

«¡€¦ÔФõ¦Э¡»
03LOL at that 3 looking thing
lol
03the one after the ¡ is a black box on here though
really? .-.
03yes
03well I'm using the Fixedsys font
03it's kinda borky about utf8 LOL
I'm using Times New Roman lol
03there usedg to be Fixedsys Excelsior but it looks like complete crap on Windwos 7, that's basically an XP-only font XD
what script??
03the one that put the link to that jpb
03*jpg
nah, iy doesn't repond to colour
03oh
03fixedsys just looks the best to me, prolly because it's the mIRC default and changing it just looked weird to me
03o.o
03the guy who directed God of War 3 went to some random college?
03interesting XD
6</random>
03LOL
03well it was this ad on TV
03for something called Art Institute
03which.. sounds sketchy as heck
03because real colleges don't advertise on MTV
6that's not sketchy at all lol
6AI is one of the top art schools in the country
6as to why they advertise...no idea
03there's probably over 9000 colleges by that na...what
6granted, it's not Cal Arts or anything
6but it's a really good school
03well the commercial looked like it was a low budget thing
6but to that, I give a big fat nope
03which makes me think sketchy as frick
03but whatever you say LOL
12"there are many institutes of art but there is only ONE Art Institute!"
/me 12hides
03LOL these commercials are so dumb
6yeah um, AI is extremely costly
6they're the most advertised school I know, doing every bit of marketing including high school visits
03then they should totally be able to afford commrecials that look like they cost more than $10 to make :|
6but when you look at the tuition page, put in your major, and find that the total tuition and fees hits 99k
6there's a problem LOL
6although I think that literally IS a problem
6but tuition alone for a year is 25k
03dear lord
/me turns off MTV Hits
03I cannot stand this video
6I'm paying 23k a year at fullerton for tuition, housing, books, everything
03the one for Katy Perry's newer song Last Friday night
03because it totally makes fun of people with bracdes etc :|}
03*braces
03and that's just not cool
6speaking of friday
6reminds me of rebecca black
6reminds me of the video my friend showed me
03LOL ew
07lol
6of her singing without the autotune
03but you know the song I mean?
07did you see the new one

03wtf is going on here o.o
Insanity
THE BLACK HOLE
03anyway bbl
12derp
12Hello Umbreon
<Drake> I'm angry.
12hi
03I was eating some M&Ms, and that filling on my tooth started hurting like crazy x.x
12sounds like sensitivity
12have you have candy before?
03yes.
03but it started hurting before too
12then that blows that idea
03ever since I Got the filling
03I dunno if maybe they didn't do a good job of it and left some caviry intact :/
03*cafity
03*CAVITY
03God
12i have a filling that hurts whenever i drink something cold
12:/
03so that's normal? x.x
12no
12it shouldn't
6how long ago did you get the filling
03maybe 2 months?
12me, july 2nd
6thats not good
03at who, me or him
6you
03:/
03well
12agreed
6cold temperatures do that
6sugar shouldnt
03if I even touch it
03with my finger
03it hurts a little
6um
6get that checked
6before you have to have what my best friend had done
12if your tooth all of a sudden falls out
6it was miserable
12i'd get that checked too
6no
03it's like in the way back of my mouth, my toothbrush can't reach there
03Aurora, what was that?
6he'd need a root canal first
03I've heard that term, what IS a root canal?
6if a filling isn't done right, the cavity decays inward
12dentist Aurora at our service :)
6basically
6the tooth decays inside out
6but so deep into the tooth that they need to drill into the root
6it's horrible
/me cringes
6but the pain of an infected root is worse
I popped in at the wrong time
03hm
03yeah see
03when they drilled it
03it didn't even hurt
.-.
6if your cavity is causing trouble, get it checked now before it gets really bad
03and I didn't get novacaine either
6that's nothing new
6I had that for my first cavity
03LOL
03well
03supposedly it hurts
03for some people
03getting cavities drilled
6depends on what part of the cavity, and on the person
03what kinda bugged me though
03is he gave me a novacaine shot for my other cavity
03and it didn't even kick into effect
03until after I left
03>_>
03so I leave there with a numb mouth and I'm like FFS
6lol
6sounds a lot like mine too
03drinking water was so hard
03so when I went back to get the second one drilled
6my second cavity, he gave me 3 shots before it kicked in, 15 minutes later
03I was like you know what, forget it, don't give me the shot
12XD
03but hm
03I guess I'll tell my mom to call the dentist
03problem is my classes :/;
03I don't have much of a break between the morning and night class x.x
03and well
03if the cavity was still there
03would it hurt when I touch it like that?
6if it's getting inflamed yes
03hm
6the cavity is probably pressing up against the root, or the thin part of the tooth that's left
6which would in turn press against the root
03I mean, the two cavities I had, I never even felt anything
03so Iw as like "wait, what, I have cavities?"
6the more that decays in there, the more root is exposed
03so this is odd :/
o_O
Nah.
12WoW?
03EW WORLD OF WARCRACK
12why do people think it's addictive
12it's not
03because people waste their lives playing it
I'm thinking Romantic Children is a great song
eh
I got bored o fit
12i played it for like a month
12quit for 6 months, tried again for another month
after getting three characters to 85
12quit again, it's nothing special
03well you're prolly one of few people who thinks like that
nini all
Flareon out
12i'd probably play it
12if it was cheaper
12personally i don't think it's worth the 15 dollars a month
I wasn't paying for it
<.<

6lol
03even if it were free I wouldn't play it
12if it was free i'd toy with it
12i wouldn't play it
03I hate MMOs in general
BTW, if WoW doesn't open up a totally free thing
12another thing to add to your hate list :P
It's gonna die
:P
12your love list is like 5 things
12then everything else is hate
Free MMO's are taking the market right now
6especially with games like dragon's nest coming out
03LOL
League of Legends is by far the most prominant free game right now.
6that too

03I'm not obsessed or anything

03of course she was trying to get me to admit that earlier and I was like no
So you ADMIT IT
03no?
03hm
12nah, i don't see the traits of an obsession in drf
03I think this guy in the movie ATL is Keith David
03as in
03the voice of Goliath in Gargoyles
03kinda an odd role for him XD
12the only obsession he has is the obsession of having to have everything high def and high quality digitally
03yeah, that's called quality wh*ring

Hi everypony
brb g2 get my wireless keyboard - can't do altcodes with laptop
Ok.
Hey RDash.

RDash - IT'S A CODE!
What's a code??!
Shall I paste the clue you got on the thread?
RDash: http://www.ponychan.net/chan/chat/res/36384990.html
sure, but PM yes?
PM?
Well so i get it cuz I triforced it? so others can also play your game?
◙ ♀ ♫ ▬ ↑ * . 0 2 4 : N P
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
LOL
Where'd you get that from?
ALTing
10, 12, 14, 22, 24, 42, 46, 48, 50, 52, 58, 78, 80

Ahh.
That makes sense.

You'll find out.
;)

hmm
i will??
I mean i'm sorta lost again
and is bird = 33?
:P
Welp, I dunno.
:D
sure you do >_<
posted again on /chat/ :P
!33
!bird
>_< now what?
You tell me. :o
How the heck does all this relate to the original string of numbars?
68747470 31262677 77772564 65646961 66697265 25636664 26367966 31713864 78787668 39623163 65?
That's for you to work out. :P
=[ ok...
Haha,I've been trying to figure that out XD
lol RDash
Welp, if you go on /chat/ you'll see where i'm up to, RDash
It wouldn't be any fun if I told you and it got insta solver. :P
solved*
This shouldn't take that long.
...
Maybe.
example : In 'The Ticket Master,' Twilight's Friendship report says that having more [something] than your friends can make you feel pretty awful. Having more what?
oh and it's 4 i have so far actually
Ooh, cool.
>_< curse youuuuu. my ultimate weakness
Oh yea, the trivia's coming along great!
hmmmm
how do these relate to the original string of 82 numbers
also, answer is 'blessings'
::P
Ah.
I wouldn't have known that. XD
Bene :P
(good in italian. something I love to say for soem reason)
It means well in Latin.
(trivia's s'posed to be hard, rite ? )
And latin, yes :P
grammar school = have to do 5 years of Latun
Well it'll have harder and easier questions I suppose.
Yea some are 'what colour is twi's eyes' i think
Just depends on what you know anyway.
^
one is : When Twilight became enraged in 'Feeling Pinkie Keen,' and when she drank some hot sauce in 'Friendship is Magic Part 1,' what pokémon did she resemble?
But im gonna go back to THE CODE!
bird is 2 9 18 4 ... ?

"10, 12, 14, 22, 24, 42, 46, 48, 50, 52, 58, 78, 80
Looks as though I made a mistake with the last 3 numbers, it should be 60, 80, and 82.
"
OH COME ON 8<

so 58 78 80 is 60 80 82?
rofl
Yeah.

omagad ok den
So close, but so far Dman.
What the numbers in original code?
82 is the no. of numbers in the original code
I got nothin'.
Same...
10, 12, 14, 22, 24, 42, 46, 48, 50, 52, 60, 80, 82 are all even numbers, and 82 in original code, and Hex works with 2number/letters at a time

7Hows your game?
/me stares Sathi,ready to draw his pistol out as the "Good,Bad and Ugly" stare-down theme plays
*stares at
My game went well....
7but?
I died after killing 10 other robots
I mean Mechs.
7aww... how come?
7hard mode activated?
7no idea though don't play many games
7:)
7Just WoW / Left4ponies and sometimes some TF2
No.....the difficulty is upped every time you kill a mech.
7Oh I see
Offtopic,but how come "My little Pony" becomes good,and "Transformers" becomes bad nowadays?
My fragile little mind does not comprend that.
7well.. transformers is not my cup of tea
Old Transformers are my cup of tea thought.
7i've seen the movies with my bf though
The live-action ones?
Guess what's my most hated movie of all time!
Transformers:Revenge of the Fallen,that's what!
RANDOM VID TIME!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIDHDif7fmo&feature=channel_video_title
7I figured that :p
7why though?
I saw that movie when it came out on DVD.I was a HUGE fan of Transformers at the time,and i was incredibly hyped for the movie,then i saw it.Dumb action,terrible SFX,horrible actors,and to top it all off,a Decepticon that says fuck.Oh,and Optimus dies.I cried and ran away,then went to play on my PS2.
Thank god for Dragon Ball Z.
It cheered me up.
7aww
7Well I did not like the movie aswell
That movie made me incredibly bitter.
7but luckilly for you as a fan it was just a movie...
7I wonder if they ever make a WoW movie how the huge fanbase will react on it
They probably be all like "OMG THIS SUCKS THE NEW RACE ISN'T THERE IHATE THIS SO MUCH!"
*I HATE
*They'll
I don't remember the new race's name.
Warren or something...
7Worgen
7and Goblins
Oh right.
7Goblins are epic though
7so much fun
7why yes i'm horde
I never saw then in the game.I played the trial version,didn't like it alot,but still good.
*them
7well the trial changed
7you can play as long as you want now for free
7till the lvl cap
7 20
7pretty neat if you ask me
7+ if you decide to buy wow you get the second expansion for free giving you the freedom to lvl to 70
Ok,but i'm not that much of a fan.You're free to have your opinion though.
7SOON! you will though ;)
Waddaya mean?
7You will all be WoW-ified
/me 7nods
7When did you play?
2 months ago.
I was a lvl 4 undead rogue
7hmm that still recent
7what did you like / dislike?
Like:Customization,quests.
Dislike:Graphics,etc.
7graphics aren't that bad?
7it's just a bit comic / fantasy style
7that's actually what I like
7you picked the good side of the game though!
/me 7is pleased
Yea,i like comic/fantasy graphic style,it's just the graphics are blocky and stiff.
7blocky and stiff.. I agree the characters need an update.. but the world is simply amazing
True dat.
/me 7is looking up some screenies
7http://blastr.com/assets_c/2009/08/Wow_Abyssal_Maw-thumb-550x296-22691.jpg

Wait a minute,i'll check,it's just that i'm watching that vid i posted earlier.
7no worries!
Ok,now i'll check.

you mean pony or non-pony?
pony of course :P
or, non-pony
just interested, and bored
well, I've got 2 fics starring SilverMane, who's a regular here
both WIP
and I've got some poems and short stories that are non-pony on my DA page

Will SilverMane's serious commissioned one be availably publicly?
or is it a private affair?
if you want, I've got a bit of it done but not much
I have a self-insert role also
/me shameless publicity /gasp
Hi
I mean when it's finished :P
errrr, that's a big *when* I'm not sure if I want to continue it or the CMC fic at this point
btw, is this RBD?
I'll take the updates on the you/DSNesmith written one, since I was here for all that as it was started, but I'd like to read the silvermane commission all at once :L
everyone is RBD. RBD is a notion, a feeling. A state of mind.
...so yes?
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/original/5779_-_macro_pinkie_pie.png
I'm just mib_rf7tmy
well, the serious fic got about...mmmm...3 pages in before I ran out of ideas and went to bed, then when I woke up I had other crap and I just keep putting it off
I've actually been updating a fantasy fic, original setting not fanfic, fairly often, or at least adding to it
but yeah, between the 3 projects I don't know which to just stick with and finish, the fantasy one is probably going to be a whole lot longer than the other two
k, that's it, I'm going to do some WRITING!
but srsly RBD is everywhere and nowhere
in the shadows, under the spotlights.
fair enough thb
tbh*
and the CMC one seemed to just lose a bit of its strenth
strength*
ummmm...help me out here, of the 2 fics in progress that are pony-related which one would you have me finish?
the non-CMC one will carry some more serious undertones
hey photofinishhim
/me feels creative juices flowing...either that or the mike n ikes
/me WOOT
probably creative juices, unless you are on the toilet
...why would I bring my desktop into the bathroom? lol
oatmeal? are you CRAZY?!
cuz that would be baws?
/me totally doesn't have
/me multiple personalities
also,i'm on a friends laptop. showing him what i know of the herd, even though he is my senior by about 5 months
/me hehehe
/me hahaha
what was that about multiple personalities?
Yeah, the herd mind
is great and powerful
Not like,
that poser Trixie
Finish him we must,
and burn the remains!
Trixie does not have anyting on Silvermane. Silvermane is the greatest thing ever, and SilverMane dislikes the sexy trixie for Trixie speaks to highly of Trixie, even though Silvermane is clearly better.

That's why he's a bad fugitive.
He's doing it wrong.
l2 lurk
I -was- lurking. But then, silvermane...
Goddamn you SilverMane.
also, RBD is a terrible liar because he and SilverMane are the only 2 who know of my comm fic
lol. you know you love me
ReticentSmolder >mfw I'm not hiding from YOU am I
you could NEVER hide from me *batseyes*
say reticentsmolder, are you still working on both stories, or have you dropped one
>implying DARI would know it was me if I spoke to you about a fic only me and Silvermane knew about
so yeah, you dropping the CMC one?
@SilverMane I'm thinking of dropping the CMC one, maybe get DSN to finish some and I'll take over again
it was going good, was great honestly
that could work, DSNesmith does good stuff too
want a pastebin link?
well, it started as a collab with DSNesmith
right, i remember the original writing
of course, I didn't know it was a collab till about half way through and he was bailing...

/me Nopony appeared.
/me He raised his hoof again, when the door opened slowly of its own accord. Silvermane stepped inside, looking around for the owner. "Oh, not again, freakin' prank callers."

oh, can you copypasta images without links, like ones you have saved?

/me Dawn peeked through the window onto a light-brown pegasus stallion, his front half hanging over the edge of a moderately sized bed seemingly unaware of the blood rushing to his head. The light struck his eyelids, and the filtered rays coaxed the pony out of his fitful dream.
/me Opening his eyes with a groan, Silver Mane was suddenly hit by a wave of vertigo at the sight of the ground before him, causing his other half to slide off the bed with a crash. ‘I should really look into sleep therapy,’ he thought idly as he brushed his signature mane out of his eyes.
0New Dari Bot Post: 2722
I know exactly how that feels Silvermane in the story...
/me The window beside his bed looked out onto a small avenue in the small town of Ponyville, the sun just now rising above the brightly colored roof tops.
i've done that. it was fun. then my nerves recovered
/me Silver Mane pulled himself to his hooves and scanned his Spartan apartment for the thick oak door that lead to the common hallway. Nuzzling the door softly, so as not to wake the other boarders, he snuck down the hallway towards a door at the far end.
I wasn't sure if I wanted it 'Spartan' or utilitarian
spartan is proper, if you mean minimalist or emptyish
Either way it shouldn't be capitalized.
@Dashite but its named after a people
/me After knocking once with a yawn and feeling confident he wouldn’t barge in on somepony, Silver pushed the door open and took a quick glance in the mirror above the water trough. His mane was a scraggly with bed head as he worked a brush with his teeth along the edges he could reach.
yeah, and word auto-corrects it :P
/me . A few minutes of brushing and preening his wings later he was feeling refreshed and ready to take on the world while he trotted down the hallway and downstairs.
WAT
I LIIIIIIIIIIIIIIVE
what...?
/me The stairs bent to the right and led into a small kitchen that the boarders shared. To Silver’s surprise he saw Reticent Smolder, a recently moved in unicorn with a shaggy burnt-orange mane and a burgundy coat, fixing a simple breakfast of eggs and oatmeal on the stove.
10BACK IN TEAL GLORY
NO WAY
self-insert powah HASTUDO
inb4 uber troll

Word in this instance is wrong. You are using spartan as an adjective so it shouldn't be capitalized.
/me “Morning Reticent, didn’t expect to see you up this early, any special plans?” Silver mane teased. He met Reticent a few days ago but the pony rarely left his room from what he could tell.
@Dashit, good to know, I'll correct it
/me 10braces for ubertroll
Dashite*
/me thinks he should be bracing for impact instead.

/me Sitting in a chair at the large oak table in the center of the kitchen, Silver thought about what he was going to do today.

/me “Haha, you stud, I hope it goes well,” Silver said between bites. The two enjoyed the rest of their meal in silence before Reticent got up and started to put the rest of the oatmeal into a large carrying container.

/me Silver Mane trotted out of the kitchen while he was busy and into the common room before pushing his way through the building’s wide front doors and out into the early autumn sun.
inbr i called RS a stud
/me Unsure of how he wanted to spend his day, Silver decided on flying around town in search of somepony he knew or whatever looked interesting. With a powerful beat of his wings, he lifted off of the ground and over the heads of several earth ponies before clearing the rooftops and into the great blue expanse above.
@SilverMane you were joking
i know, i can tell, but still makes me giggle
lol

"Please wait approximately 1 minute and 17.62 seconds, and try again."

Now I have to wait 1 minute 21.49 seconds?
Why would you even include the decimal places on that?
lolwut SilverMane?
yeah... i now regret trying to read the rerapening.
also, would you like some names for your characters RS?
yes, please, I tried that link I posted for ideas, but it sucks if you have a character in mind
I keep getting 'Watermelon Medley' :D
alright, give me pony type, coloration, and personality or character archetype, unless you wish to build off the name

especially since it's a QUEEN piece
k, 2 dice on ONE side of the chess piece
...not better
k, 1 dice and a chess piece

that would be horrible Dman

10dman i can try and help if you want
SilverMane - it already exists, bjornfort made it
Yes RainBroDash!
Where part 2?
10I'll have to read the thread though first
i refuse to accept his existance, dman. bjornfort doesn't exist
in /chat/?
10i know dari will have made it blindingly obvious from the way he worded something

also, yea rainbrodash, please halp! http://www.ponychan.net/chan/chat/res/36384990.html

I LOVE RIDDLES
hex works in pairs: So 26 = 2F in your world somewhere. 2F base 16 = 16*2 = 32. (lololol)
232! It's when 166 and 2 fuck.

Math porn!
lol, x = sex xP
but gais part 2?!?
I bet in this age, in middle school, average math grades would increase if math was pornographic.
i'll think of some, but i have to go soon. peace
X = fuck for instance.
later SilverMane
so RainBroDash, now that SilverMane isn't here we should write a clopfic
16 and 2 kiss and make 19. 16 and 2 fuck and give you 32. Now to properly illustrate 16^2, I'll need to get some parental permission. :p

10also: dman. I knew I'd suck at dari's puzzle. I'm thinking about it while eating this icecream, and I'll get back to you
Icecream is good :P
And I almost did it again. Caught myself just before I pressed the key.
I'm not going to worry about the puzzle since it might spoil Inception.

@RBD http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-what-did-you-say-about-fluttershy.jpg
10meh :3
my fav's in order: Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Twilight Sparkle, Rarity, Rainbow Dash, Lyra, Applejack, Photo Finish, all other OC or background
Applejack loses to Lyra, I hear enough Texan accents as is
10ReticentSmolder I kinda agree with dat Applejack
10But rarity is even worse than AJ
10i guess fluttershy > AJ > rarity
Rarity...has her own charm if you work around some of her awful bits early on
well, AJ lags behind in my list because of my Texan bias dontchaknow.jpg
RainBroDash why don't I love your shit! Fluttershy is best pony
RainBroDash, be careful, fluttershy will rape you with love http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/photos/images/original/000/134/181/12860%20-%20flutterage%20fluttershy%20parody%20The_Hulk.jpg?1308034848

@RBD y u no Twilight?

10she's in top half of my mane 6

Hurray for scripting! : D
10@dman this fileception b/s isn't really making that much sense to me, aside from the blindingly obvious, which it isn't
what's the blindingly obvious bit?
also, if you're doing it / even if not, do you have Skype?
10well what -would- be blindingly obvious, like opening a hidden .rar file within the file
10but that didn't work, there wasn't one
10Dman, what's the sum total of file size of actual important flash filey business you found in the file?
10just so we can see if there's anything else in that file, or if we should be searching for a different download link for part 2 instead
10>idk if any of this makes sense, but it's my only logical next step
RainBroDash i have a pic of it opened in SOTHINK SWF DECOMPILER, what do you mean 'what's the sum total of file size of actual important flash filey business you found in the file?'
10I mean, can you tell how many kb the flash file takes up?
The flash file i in two part dm-

did you reply to my 'what do you mean' question
?
10"<RainBroDash>: I mean, can you tell how many kb the flash file takes up? "
The flash file is in two part D_man, the second part can't be inside the first part.
Although that would have been a good idea.
I should have done that. XD
Meh, oh well.

10I'll scroll up
Damn you real life. I actually tried putting a .zip in a .rar, and the computer gave me an error.
Lol.
Might work in Linux.
A zip in a rar in a txt file.
is it?
Nope.
thout not
I was trying a zipped .txt file in a .rar file.
ok i'll extract the .swf again!
Lol.
10DMAN.
You need part 2!
RAINBRODASH
^
Eugh
10Do you know how many kb of flash file you have?
AAAH!.rar contains AAAH!.zip, which contains AAAH!.txt.
RainBrODash - properties says 35,000KB (36,000KB disk)
rainbrodash - explain what you mean 'hoe many kb of flash' please :P
10I mean when you look in your program which extracts the flash file
10how much is there
10because if it's <35.0kb then there's hidden stuff in the file
10that isn't in swf format
Oh of course!
10>mfw dari only sees OH OF COURSE, and gets mad at me for helping dman
10tponono
also wtf rainbrodash - do you know the answer?
if you look at the ponychan chat you can see the pic i uploaded of it extracted btw
oh fuck no
10no, by -helping- I mean aiding you in solving the problem by attempting to solve it myself
10but dari hates me atm
10:3
RBD was here, Dari is a loser
why dari hate you ;(
Because he won't sing.
10because I won't sing

10anyway
Aniway
so
um
just looking at erry line of code in the .swf rite now
10you say you put the biopsy on the chat thread, yeah?
MFW you're doing it wrong
Yes rainbrodash
10MFW no idea who dari is talking to
Check thread for another hint.
oh?
lol, I'm playing Touhou while checking in on chat and seeing if you guys stop talking about puzzles
haha
mfw> OH SHIT I DIDN'T PAUSE CORRECTLY
dead
10ok dman, I have zero programming experience.
I do, I'm a comp sci major
10;_______;
: /
I'm just a huge puzzle fan
10Reticent, wanna help us with a programming sentence.
MFW you're not half way through the puzzle yet.
...I have 3 years of Java experience, 1 in Python and 1 in C++
:P
10basically, dari mentioned concatenation, and after googling it I know what it means, but your experience might help us un-muddy the issue
lol...concatenation is nothing like adding, are we talking strings or integers?
10"MAYBE SILVER WORKED OUT A CLUE! However instead of just "CAT", it's actually concatenate. *HINT* *HINT*"
10reticent, MFW I KNOW NOTHING.
well, are the numbers actual numbers or are they characters? like 'a' or 'Þ'
So my latest clue SHOULD tell you how the fileception works.
10fuck knows
yea that 'silver clue' was completely not understandable : /
ie should?
it should? *
well, I guess I'm involved now, someone post me a link
Then, with the other clues I've given you should be able to work it out.
where tha HECK did silver get the '1999' from?
YEAAAAAAH Dari except we've never used a concatenate command in ourlives.
so, great. I'm stuck
^ THIS
D_man, I was joking about Silver actually getting something right.
^
oh ok so that's not a clue at all?
also
But concatenate is actually a clue.
but concatenate was the clue
concatenate - Link (things) together in a chain or series
also: i clued the clue
MFW first time i've heard this word. ever.
if we're talking hex pairs don't you think you might want to bring up an ASCII table? /trollface
yeah, it's like when you bring two strings together and it forms one or some shit
ALSO RETICENT U R NO HALP ;___________;
INB4 ReticentSmolder gets it in 10 seconds flat
rundeepdown - i haven't got a clue
inb4 Probably, seeng as he actually has some coding experience ;_;
already got it dari
D_man: I'm guessing that's RBD too then? Since I don't see him speaking.
well, the way to get it
FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
whats this about loading .swf into mother .swf?
where's a fucking pen when you need it
D_man: Wut?
so it's not a .swf file within the .swf file?
just something i found on google mate
i love puzzles
10kk so dari has blocked both my hostnames, brb finding a new proxy ;______; (either that or he's just choosing to 'ignore' what i say, but either way I can't do anything towards this puzzle, so i might aswell get a proxy)
10so brb
@RainBroDash I solved it
WHAT?
10ReticentSmolder there's no way i can be expected to solve it anyway
well yeah, i told you a few lines ago
10ReticentSmolder I don't even know what the fracking word means :P
really Dari, you could've made the cipher a bit harder
/trollface
@trollfacemeter ReticentSmolder
6 ReticentSmolder is 27% trollface. (521)
its so bad you have to play it if it makes sense
10>says harder. >means harder for a comp sci major
Did he use Caesar Cypher?
I could've, but then it never would hve been solved.
wait wait wait
reticentsmolder you solved the filewithinafile thing with the 35KB file?
RainBroDash - this is impossibru
10D_man not really :P
10just we're out of our league ^^
I can solve Caesar Cypher within an hour or few just by trial and error.
Very easy coding.
Also, thunder.
RainBroDash that's always the difference between us, between many people
I WILL NEVER ACCEPT DEFEAT!
MFW I should have used stegnographic encryption for files later on instead of just a simple password.
10well it's just another language
Do RSA encryption.
lol RainBroDash, its ASCII code, any more than that I won't say
10>mfw I write a few sentences in complex french, suddenly dari can't translate it, can't solve my problems. OH LOOK IM MASTER TRICKSTER LOL
Aww crap. This storm is a mile to my east.
And it's moving south.
big rigs over the road racing>>>>ET for the atari 2600
10ReticentSmolder I'm not doing the puzzle anymore :3 since it's made for you comp sci people to solve
in sheer comedy value
What the hell are you talking about prince?
confused
It's pretty simple to do now. :P
no it isn't >_<
asc...ii?
I'd play it but I don't want the game to crash every two seconds
I dunno
yes? I dunno, gimme a sec, I was pretty sure I had something
ET with friends make them play it and its instant lulz
for 10 minutes then they're crying
So reticentsmolder HASN'T solved it!
or you have?
MFW you need to read all my clues ReticentSmolder.
yeah I just read the one in the link, I'm now looking through all of them
No.
oh...
well in big rigs you can fall through bridges, pass through your opponent, win every time, scale mountains in seconds, pass through buildings, and go into reverse for infinity
I've told you how I've done the fileception.
I've told you where to look too. :P
whut
conc...
concatenate?
i've extracted every filething, so .swf .flv and .as in the .swf
can't find anything
Because that's only one half.
That's not important now.
please bear in mind i don't get codin g :P
You need to find part 2. :P
So i ignore the .swf file?
I wonder how many catridges of et were actually sold to begin with o-o
is it another mediafire link?
so, is the file actually part of the riddle or was the original list what we're supposed to work with?
Reticentsmolder, read whole thread >_<
ohhh hai everyine

oh link yea
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/chat/res/36384990.html#36385335
yeah, so I've been on a roll and I think I've got how to get the answer, just in the process of figuring it out
oh rly?
1.5 million copies
2.5-3.5 million went unsold
!
just addign random file extensions?
assign*

okay, I'm a little stuck so here's my theory, the paired numbers are actually hexadecimal placeholders for ASCii code, namely characters and commands in an ASCii table
Flutterhi - yup done that
or i think i have
which ones have you tried?
Reticentsmolder i have no idea what you're talking about i'm afraid
/me isn't frozen
flutterhi - most, suggest me some and i'lll tell you if i hav
the original list, translated into ASCii makes no sense, so I read on and found the file, but I haven't opened it because I don't have winrar and 7zip refuses to
MFW you're overcomplicating it ReticentSmolder.
It's pretty simple to be honest. :P
reticentsmolder - have you actually read my posts?
yeah
IS PART 2 another link?
another file another download?
x.x im so fucking sick of my asshole of a mother

yeah I saw the swf post and the weird files in there, what do you use to open a swf?
10>mfw the 2nd download link is something to do with the massive numbers dari gave at the start, and the word concatenate, but I'm out cause i dont know what it means

Part 2 is fileception.
PROBLEM SOLVED
but wtf that mean

10You have to find the LINK to part 2.
ooooooooooooooooooooh, see I'm too used to code junkie stuff
lol
RainBroDash: But do do that.
You need to find
reticentsmolder - think outside every box
10and that is to do with concatenate i guess?
...
10also: dari didn't block me
10lol'd
FILECEPTION
because:
YFW I set it to clear in 30 minutes.
FUUUUUUUUU
10>mfw dari makes a puzzle that requires comp sci knowledge. "OH LOL U GUISE TAKE SO LONG" yeah because we don't know comp sci
to do that*

10dari btw, concatenate isn't used outside of comp sci. face it
*again
reticentsmolder then BE CLEVER
MFW the function is even called concatenate.
In the program I was using.

10also :trollface: before dari gets genuinely mad
you can concatenate strings, and you can add integers, but concatenating integers is like 3+4 is 34

Does it sound like something I'd normally say?
i'm in a moderately serious mood, so you may wish to not sound harsh when insulting each other.
yes it does acutally >_<

03AcomData makes like, the best extern1al hard drives ever, IMHO)
USB 2 and 3 are supposed to be 100% backwords compatible o.o

03well
03it doesn't mention 2.;0 at all
Someone?
Anyone?
uhm
10change hex, as in translate the hex pairs into another base
yfw those hints suck
PLEASE?!
Odd
03so hm
10would be my guess
03yeah
>So this is the hint. STFU before I change the hex I put on you
Well I'm trying not to make it too obvious.
10buuut I'm usually wrong
But you guys are making it hard.
03what I find hilarious is that Amazon is selling those drives for like $60 more than the official site

@tiredmeter SilverMane
6 SilverMane is 65% tired. (524)

There's a reason I capitalised "find" before. :P

CTRL F lurker
NOPE
CTRL F www.
NOPE
MFW !!Derpy's challenge ages ago was technical and no one complained about that.

/me should just download DOSBox .v.
DID WE FIND PARRT 2?
D_man: you're probably seraching for hex and not ASCII
actually silvermane it was a reply to you :P
CTRL F MEDIAFIRE / .com nope
Because Ctrl-f lurker is exactly right.
i don't even know what's going on, and I don't really care. i just miss the comedy
ohhh god can somepony link me to part2
Wut
did we find part2?
does it make a difference if the file is .jpg or .gif when opened?
lol
i have no idea
yes
big differnce
there two different file formats
when opened in hex editor though?
no
welll that's what i did
erm

Uploading the picture to ponychan killed it or something?

D_Man what was the next clue
Flutterhi - it's one of the first posts
Done I think.
Just checking.
Look at my images flutterhi
!advice
lemme just open up 'Ls theme A'
flutterhi - been ther edone that
look at the images i put on the /chat/ thread please
02I'm trying to think lmao
02That kind of sounds like a hint to Monster Hunter Tri though
Ok.
Look at thread.
I looked
Well, if you want. I wasn't thinking of it this time, haha.
cant find lurker
Ahh,
Because I changed it.
oh?
bene
fine
02Nah, I don't know what I"m in the mood for atm
is it 'netscape'?
Let me just check something. :)
D_Man umm which picture
the one of the gif breakdown
flutterhi just all of mine on ponychan
so u can see what I did
inb4 a hex line within the hex line
/me can't find needed medication.
sigh
Maybe it changes it because it's a GIF?
flutterhi - one of the first ones
I dunno.
i think i'll hit up mcdonalds after i print my fanfic here
well download the ponychan pick AND CHECK please >_<
pic *
It works before I upload anyway.
before isn't the one we see : (
so donwload the after and check to see
I can't think of anything, either.
Well, I could just upload the file to a different location.
:P
or that
ok I get it now
INB4 uploading it somewhere else breaks it too.
welp
shoulda thought this thru i guess ; (
and I was having so much fun...
why is that picture all the way at the top
which one?
I'm think it has to be because the image is a GIF or something.
Which is annoying.
yo
And ponychan breaks it.
>_>
send it to me via email
i have many pics flutterhi
and I'll post it to my site
so does anyone want to talk about anything interesting? Personal problems, drug habits, porn, art, anything?
I'm uploading it to mediafire.
the reason ponychan and imgur break it is they they remove associated file data
and take ONLY THE IMAGE
The image stays the same size.
My mum's kicked me from her house so i don't know where i'm going to be living, it's why it's all hectic right now with my stuff, Ive never done drugs, porn doesn't turn me on as i find it's so much about personality and not just titties, I love drawing landscape art in pencil, ...Im loving this puzzle
What? :(
awww
Lolwhat what?
answerin' silvermane ofc ;D
condolenses D_man, sorry to hear you were kicked out. why was tat happening/
Why did she kick you out of the house?
ok where's that link :P
Oh silvermane
guys uh
Because i'm almost 18 so it's illegal but i'm living with my dad till 18 where it'll be legal
she hated me and only wanted custody over sister when they divorced

Wow.

You can have my company, but you don't like in the US.

There's another?

Haven't read

/me RainBroDash (who will be known as RBD for the sake of don't ask why) alighted onto the cloud stoop in front of Rainbow Dash's mansion in the sky. He didn't know what was so urgent, but the letter he received left him more than a little curious.
I'm wanting to write about weather they /can't/ control.

I actually have the whole story in my head now.

it's a very sad story; it's one of those stories that really feels humanized, like it could actulaly happen. more of a projection of humanity onto a pony world, rather than a story in pony world with occasional human problems

Right before he thought his heart was going to jump out of his throat and strangle him, the door swung inwards, revealing Rainbow Dash, apparently just out of the shower and wearing a loose baby blue robe.

filter out the red in the picture?
or perhaps
10Also: not true. but funny
/me RBD had never been inside her castle of clouds, but the layout had been pretty obvious from the outside. Through the kitchen was an opening that led into the living room. It appeared well stocked with food, albeit a little dirty from the tomboy's lack of oversight.
filter only the red
mfw i can't code let alone image edit stuff
should I boot up PS
I have not got PS
image diting is way easier then coding
I do
lemme give it a go

GTFO, you're supposed to be burning alive.
PS: No one cares ;)

/me Passing by the counter tops and fridge, RBD made his way into the living room. It was cozy and had a large window showing a wide panorama of Ponyville in the dying sunlight below them.

dari should I be filtering?
Mebbe.

/me He could hear Dash's hooves scuffle around upstairs. It sounded like she was moving fairly quickly, thought that shouldn't be a surprise, but he thought he heard her practically tripping over her own hooves.
i don't know how to filter anything >_<
10>mfw you need to xray the picture and see what kind of underwear the goggles are wearing
>goggles
>underwear
Wut
10It's the only thing I can almost do on photoshop...
Just red goggles.
/me The living room was lightly furnished, all of the pieces being made of clouds. He decided to sit on the sofa lying in the center of the room facing the window.

!sneas
;p
Unless you actually happen to have some red goggles lying around.
/me Nervous and apprehensive, RBD's mind began to race at the possibilities of what Dash could want at this hour. Was it a surprise? A party? Did she want to confess her deep-seated desire for him even thought they had barely met just a week ago and he didn't want to come off as too forward and oh my gosh what am I doing here I shou-

Really, that's not a nice place to be anyway ReticentSmolder.

he's good at this, first he's writing how i act, moderately, then how you think
you are an open book RainBroDash :P

anyone want to surgically give me full-sized wings that function properly? I'll trade you the SilverMane fortune for them
I'm on the right track
theres a hidden word at the top
working on it
/me RBD decided it would be best not to look, let Dash do whatever she had planned and get this over with so the beating in his chest would stop reminding him of exactly how much adrenaline was pumping through his veins.
jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the OH GOD IT'S IN MY EYES! WHY!
gah ok i get it i have to use a red filter! but i don't know how to on keyboard and have nothing red / seethrough here on me!

That's free too.

10SilverMane. That magic book fic.

WHERE'S MY LEVERAGE?
I'll get leverage.
RainBroDash, it was amazing, right?
One day.
/me holds out his arm.
So I was right about filtering
/me 10ITT: Dari wants leverage to make me sing. He has absolutely diddly squat.
/me 10has been singing for about 30 minutes. just with his mic off.
i printed off With a Spark
ain'tevenmad
MORE STORY TiME
YAY
/me Dash broke the silence first,"Well, I'm back...are you going to turn around or what?" RBD's head spun around so fast it almost threw him off the couch, and what he saw made his jaw drop and his pupils dilate to pinprick proportions.
MFW I decide the fic is too suggestive for our nice, family friendly chat room
MFW leverage

FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUU
lol
10>i've been in it all day, since you banned me from here. tpononon
Nah, no leverage gained.
10reticent he just wants leverage over me
/me owns RainBroDash's balls for now
RainBroDash, you have been hiding in my own shipping channel?
ReticentSmolder, they are on loan.
lol
*for* *now*
What is this shipping that you speak of?
>implying RainBro actually HAS balls
What a joke.
should I move this into that room?
hello
hallo barry
How are you?
10>mfw I was being insulted while in silver's channel
@SilverMane should I move this fic into your shipping channel
/me 10has no balls, according to the topic.
fantastic how about you?
ReticentSmolder, it's up to you. #SilverShipper if anyone wants to see
So now you have a phrase.

^that's the welp ponytime into numbers from letters, not hex
what dooooo 0_________0
You could take my sentence to be it is pony time.
also, stop being a mean mean meanie pants to RainBroDash
Or an instruction.
Welp, pony time.
just look at the time
pony time
Any more hex editing to do?
No.
WHEW ok
jesus

welp, pony time is 57 65 6c 70 2c 20 70 6f 6e 79 20 74 69 6d 65
Y u being mean to RBD?
nah
I told you.
:P
You could take my sentence to be it is pony time.
RBD why don't you want to sing?
[03:27] Or an instruction.
Go and pony: Time.
it is pony time gives: 69 74 20 69 73 20 70 6f 6e 79 20 74 69 6d 65 0d 0a

those numbers determine pony time

9-20 9-19 16-15-14-25 20-9-13-5 is 'it is pony time'
wrong it is silly
The wording doesn't matter.
I just reworded it above.
:P
the total number?
You're missing the pretty crucial point.
'it is pony time' is 09 20 09 19 16 15 14 25 20 09 13 05 which in hex is '	 	'
No more hex.
Remember?
bird is 33 :P
pony. 16-15-14-25.

So we've given everyone but RBD voice?
They mean that I'm faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabuloous
nononono
Yes dashite, because rbd won't sing for prince apparently

I'd sing for him, but he might never be able to hear anything ever again afterwards.

You have to close down the clock.
Change your time.
And reopen it.
:P
aka f5 on chrome
what
why
thats silly
I say pony the time.
still the same clock, bro
Maybe I should have been a bit more general than time.
no... your comp time
I changed my comp time
mmmm
and refreshed teh chorome window with the clock open
still a clock bro
Well clearly you didn't get the pony time/date right.
/date?
or your programs fucked
16 15 14 23
!time
lol
MFW this program I KNOW works fine.

!pony
That's nothing to do with this.
:P
!rand
Anyway.
Go pony the time/date
:P
and the date?
haven't changed date
but 16 15 14 23 all too high
12 months in year
right?
So you can't change the moonths.
Established.
Next?
months*
thank you
and can't see any text that says something impacting
impacting?
hmm
Wut
fuck now my "luna can change the moonths" is irrelavant
Dude.
then again 'good heavens, just look at the time' isn't there in the .swf either
Just pony the time.
16 15 14 25?
And date.
Do.
You can't change the months.
Ok.
how is 16 15 14 25 time and date?
So
no just change the time and date
What's next?
<_>
the clock gives the time
What comes after months? :P
NOTHING
oh wait
years
well, depends where you're from in the world
days
Years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds.
can i get the .swg
.swf*
Pony the time.
:P

Ok.
So you can't change the year.

Next.

anyways
month
but all 4 numbers
16 15 14 25 are all above 12
You can't change the month either.
So next.
tiemz

Wut
dude a) i can't pause time and b) if this si all so perfect then the clock will flash whatever it needs to instantly

how do i this clock

flutterhi wnat clues :3
03cr\g

There is a disturbing lack of violence and explosions in here. ):
didn't help
not at all
um
ok what have you got open right now?
the source code
and the .swf clock
hmm
all you need is the .swf clock open
no source code
and remembering that 'pony' is 16 15 14 25
12o.o
remember that the clock is your internal pc clock
so you can edit that
16 15 14 25
Date hour minute second (i'd recommend you set the 'seconds' to a little before, like 15 or so, to give you 10 seconds to refresh / reopen the .swf and prepare for teh lulz)

Sorry that I used up your time FlutterHi2

Lawl.
Good night.
!pokemon
You're sleeping now? Flutterhi2 - night
I dunno Dman.
you have been an amazing source of information throughout this puzzle!
thanks
How do you want it to work?
well
i saw one once
Someone activates with with !trivia or something.
A question is taken at random.
Anyone can answer?
Yes only mods can activate and disactivate
and it continues till disactivated
03!pokemon
that's the sorta idea :P
03LOL I am not a cat
/me shoots himself out of a cannon
Read some of this thing, its like a frikken treasure hunt.
So does it just ask a question every period of time, or when people ask it to ask a question.
It asks a q and once its answered itll ask another randomly
when a mod asks it to
Ahh.
and when it's answered it'll ask another, so not periodically but once answered.
and mods disable it again
!pokemon
So it'll be asking questions non-stop pretty much?
I suppose you have a date with Delcatty then
you told me to write two .txt files, with corresponding lines for quetions and answers - i've done just that
03!pokemon

I have LOADS of epic questions to write yet
03yeah you can have that one
03!pokemon
Ok.

02*WB03(Aurora03)02WB* - <Aurora> 06I acknowledge I have issues, I am ok with it
Is EA trying to slip Always-On DRM on me?
hi rora
03god, why is buying candy in bulk so expensive
What game?
how bulk
and how expensive
03we're trying to get dark blue and yellow candy, either jelly beans or M&M's
Medal of Honor.
03like 10 pounds
mfw you couldn't jump in mirrors edge unless you're on teh interwebs
03well
6...LOL
6wow
6thats a lot
03my sister's having a graduation party
MFW dman is wrong.
03and we wanted to do school colors
I want to play Tier One mode just to kill boredom.
03which are blue and yellow
dashite i heard somethign like this
i don't have it thou so ok i'll believe you
03cheapest I found was to get blueberry and lemon Jelly Belly, it's like $35 for 5 pounds of each color
6ew
03$70 for 10 pounds in other words
6sounds like Gilroy High
BTW: Ubisoft is bringing Always-On DRM back.
6which was my rival high school
03but M&Ms made more sense to me
03since they're all just chocolat8e
03rather than conflicting flavors
03but those are like OBNOXIOUSLY expensive
6personalized M&Ms
03like $45 for 5lbs
6:D
03OK those
03cost $160 to get 10 pounds
03I actually checked
6wow
6nvm then
03yeah
03XD
03I mean
0310 pounds of candy may sound like a lot
I only have my Steam version installed right now so I can't double check for you, but i'm 95% sure you don't need to be online.
07lol
03but when you're having a party with 50+ people
03that's actually not that much, right?
And Ubisoft considers it's DRM a success.
I don't have to be online to play SP.
Yeah.
07my sister got personalized Jones soda for her 18th bday =P
07now THAT was expensive
03I might see about going to this Eastern Market place in Detroit
Ubisoft's DRM is successful in lowering their sales.
6how do you personalize soda
03I went there with my cooking class in high school
back, Ima crash at 1
03and they had the most awesome candy store with really cheap prices
07her picture on the label
03That's awesome
6lol
03how much did it cost though
6that's weird
I think i might go becom flutterHigh
03Jones is pretty pricy
and then watch ponies
Dman Wait, do you need to make an account, if not then I guess mine is RDash ;)
07$4 a bottle if I remember correctly
03yeah that's rediculous LOL
what are we playing?
http://forums.filefront.com/general-gaming/438740-ubisoft-returns-using-always-drm.html <- My reaction when I found out Ubi was bringing Always-On DRM back.
03even like the $1.75 or something a bottle that my school charged was a lot
03you know what I love? Faygo. Local Detroit brand, you can get 24oz for $1
03and they have redpop which is like THE MOST AMAZING FLAVOR OF SODA EVER
6o.o
http://forums.filefront.com/general-gaming/438780-ubisoft-claims-always-drm-success.html <- My reaction when I found out Ubi thinks it's successfull.
BTW, I don't use Nittany Tiger on that forum.
03also Kyu, apparently the Volkswagen Rabbit had a pickup truck version?
03they were showing it on Top Gear SXD
03-S
Please don't be in Heroes 6. :(
But I think you can pick me out.
07it used to
07in the 80s wasn't it
03yep
03they were talking about their first cars
03and racing them and stuff LOL
If the game is going to be made after Driver: SF, it'll likely be in the game.
07and nvm, it was $3 a bottle
03LOL @ the name Volkswagen Thing
When is driver?
Modern game publishers make me want to explode. They make me want to revolt.
07with 5% off cuz we got about 100 bottles XD
03that was Rick from Pawn Star's first vehicle
psht the reason I still play unreal tourney :P
03Holy crap, that's a lot of money to spend on soda o_o
RDash you don't need an account
07iknorite
I wonder if people still play C&C Renegade...
03and I thought I was crazy for spending aboutg $50 to stock my fridge in college
They're either extremely greedy or try to play Big Brother.
03-g
03on SODA mind you
03:P
07well it was a cotillion
03a what?
they fail to see what minecraft's success was based off of
created a free game that was good
gave it out for free
07it's a huge party you have for your 18th
Minecraft is too recent
07if you're a girl
07o.o
6so apparently I'm going out with a bunch of my coworkers to see a movie tonight
and then started charging
6also yeah, 18th is a HUGE deal for girls lol
awith very little drm
03wtf?
The crack dealer method...
03never heard of that here
exactly
First hit is free. :p
03inb4 Mexican traditionh that all the LOL ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS brought with them to CA
/me hides
if they had free weekends and little protection drm ect
6I didn't think there was THAT big of a difference btween states
07so people performed, fancy dinners, etc
03like quinceañeras or whatever the spelling is
6the 18th birthday is a universal party
6like
07that's a quincenera
Notch claims it has no DRM.
people would have more fun with the game and more people would buy it
07which is at 16?

04I'm having problems
6are legit
04Trying to simulate lava
04;w;
6with what program
I have it pre-ordered.
04Autodesk Maya
$20 off woo.
Because I'm not going to sit through being raped by better players with perks kicking my ass all day.
04Got the terrain to look very volcanic
03did you know Autodesk made a free CAD program for Android?
12BBL
04NICE
03yeah
03I installed it just for kicks
03not that I'd know how to use it
04Does it even work? XD
04ah
03prolly
03it's like Photoshop Lite or w/e that is
04ah
04Not that good then
Who thought rewarding experience with unbalancing perks should be shot.
04since PSLite is only filter effects :P
03LOL
Thats...quite kind
6I still need to get the serial code for Bryce
6I REALLY want to play with it
6but even though it was a free download
6it needs a serial
6fffff
Well, when I play MoH, many people that kill me have damage perks.
Many people that kill me in BC2 have damage or body-armor perks that take hours to get.
Then don't play MoH. Its time in the limelight is gone...
04Roara want to see a rough draft render of it so far?
6sure
yo my MLP shirt came
04k
Hooray!
so excited lol
04It's in the daylight with no sphere or lava
FlutterHi2 yay! what is it?
I'm slightly better at MoH than BC2.
6sorry I should rephrase
6Bryce gives you the serial
6but not the username
Heh...Circut's having a horrible time getting ready for the next stream tomorrow.
I'm uploading a picture
04Also it's litteraly on draft mode so not the BEST water effects
07uhh
but it's a plain t-shirt
07nothing do sign up on the site?
with flutterhshy winking on the back bottom right
04http://img836.imageshack.us/img836/3808/citidark.png
I must see this shirt. It is imperative.
^yep
04http://archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/b/bb/Citadark_Isle.png <== based it off that, but couldn't get everything 100% (also gotta make it more blueish and glassy I think(
04*)
Anyway, I am trying to help him out, but he certainly isn't the most organized. Right now he's trying to get the logs of panel members from the past episodes.
03:>3
Couldn't you just rip the model from the game :P
6kyu
6I'm registered to the site

6I've tried both my site name and my real name, since i used both when I signed up
6neither work
^this
ohh fuck wingboners
also: not sure why mib_aalsghugi, but yeah
they don't make sense
Where did THAT line come from?
Reticent
it came from a whisper from the wind
ofc
Wut? SUDDENLY WINGBONERS?
04HML could you kindly tell me how to do that? :P
04Anyway how is the geometry so far :V
Emulators ;D
@Dashite Yes, they seem to just *puts on sunglasses* pop up...
JK
...
jesus this T-shirt is huge
04not a bad idea actually XD
Ask someone else, it might be possble
I guess it'll shrink in the wash
I mean, try a wirefram
043d ripper DX only works for 3DS max though as I recall
*wireframe
04And I hate it's interface sooo much
04huh
also where did wingboners come from
No idea.
THEY're fucking retarded
Well, make a copy of the geometry using a screenshot?
I know

6 This pony has a wingboner from this chat: is 7Scoota6loo
Ok...i managed to find something: Dubtrot apparently caught on much like the non-pony dubstep. So taking this into account, I can estimate that 70%-90% of the internet enjoyed porn
HA
Based upon this:
NOW
Uh... really did not need to know that Scootaloo has a wing boner...
^haha
hahaha
I started walking earlier
We can also assume that dubstep is present on 1%-20% of the internet
I'll be home sometime tomorrow
!pony
lol
And you're fucking lying
Scoots, you dawg
What the heck is dubtrot?
So what.
Dubstep
I'll be home around 4-5
@clopmeter scootaloo
6 scootaloo is 49% clop. (531)
So therefore these numbers can translate into the fandom with 60%-75% for porn and 5%-21% for trotstep
ohh shit
Shut your mouth.
To google!
No, just no! Stop that!
Although I estimate that the porn percentage is much lower than those calculations
trotstep is the shit yo
03rape
Keep in mind these aren't competing percentages
@shitmeter trotstep
6 trotstep is 9% shit. (532)
@theshitmeter trotstep
6 trotstep is 91% theshit. (533)
HAHa
Wow
100%
totally accounted for O_o
The notes have spoken!
lol
so when is mane 6 coming out anypony know?
Also keep in mind my percentages are rough estimates and are based upon my(and a few other's) observations.
no clue
When it's done.
Don't have a problem with people who like them, but I don't like them myself.
Though the BMN shipping fics are just funny.
wwingboners ruined clopfics for me

/me 10is full of lost
03I mean, Google Voice gives you your own phone number, and if you have a modem, you can plug in a handset and PROFIT
You got my reference I see!

I should probably finish that game.
Ah, I had just beaten up the jerk who poisons you in Baldur's Gate.
Heh, I never played the original sadly...
:(
I did play the second and third though! So no worries!
technically 4G isn't 4G
Yeah, but you missed the origin story. :(
The 4G we have anyway
I watched a let's play of it
I was playing an insane, scs modded campaign.

yeah
what we get live updates every time equestria daily farts
And I'm level 5 or so.
"technically"
03well
Yup
03what pisses me off is that 4G is basically an excuse for companies to not upgrade their 3G
lol, complete with pie
03I know that in Europe, for example, people have 3G phones with like 12mbps and more
03and that's about what you get with '4G" here

In the normal game you can cheese the fog of war to only draw in a few enemies at a time.
With SCS, if anyone goes hostile, the entire map goes hostile.

There are around 40ish bandits on the map, half of which are elite troops.

If you start a fight before going after the boss tent, the boss characters will actually leave the tent area and come hunt you down along with everyone else.

Hey Dusky
Not today, though I've got a psychiatry appointment tomorrow
after which, I'll be going out to eat
and wednesday I'll be going to Dairy Queen
Friday.
7Sounds like you have a couple of busy days ahead of you
06Nope.

shiiiiiiiiiiiiii
It's friday.
sorry that was me
I got a split
gtg
k
06It's not
EW REBECCA BLACK
It's Monday.
^
thats wierd ;p
yeah
Fixed?
The binding shouldn't be an issue
And it would have tried linking and then spat out errors rather than timing out
72.20.16.202 is apparently not properly sending/receiving traffic
yeah
Ah o_O
And yes, Dusky
told ocean to use 72.20.16.201 when binding to island, that seemed to sort it right away
Great
Strange
So do I need to change my link block?
not really, worked anyway ;p
once I get fibre from my ISP, I'll be decomissioning the server ocean is on, their network reliability is pretty poor ;p
it's unfortunate it's not as stable as their datacenters power, I had 3.3 years uptime at one point ;p
before a mysterious reboot
Ah
The 1000 day uptime? xD
indeed ;p
I remember that
I've a nice little NAS box here, 2.84ghz q9550 quadcore, 8GB ram, 4TB zfs array, and it's a heck of a lot more stable from my ADSL2 line than staminus is
Nice o.O
Gotta bbl
Passing through water vaul from sea to lake
Seeya
heh
one of my friend's VPSes
$17 per month, photonvps, xen server, has 8 cores
nice ;p
that's not bad at all
so far I like linode and leaseweb
more linode though
15:24:24 up 70 days, 55 min, 1 user, load average: 0.12, 0.07, 0.06
that's my leaseweb server
hasn't gone down since it was bought
linode are pretty well respected, indeed
linode has awesome support
sadly they have that IP policy now >:
can't get extra IPs without a valid reason
likely because of ipv4 address exaustion ;p
Yeah
my ISP is great for that, I have 8 statuc from them ;p
statics*
o_O
lucky D:
IPv6 is easy to get atm
You have to tunnel it most of the time, though, and he.net's fremont datacenter sucks lol
indeedy, there's no shortage either
yeah
I think I still have two /64's and a /48 from he.net
I have a few
and some providers give free IPv6 IPs
I know vps247 give every customer a free /64 block
their uptime has been pretty bad though, although their network speed is decent
what I'll do with 1,208,925,819,614,629,174,706,176 + 36,893,488,147,419,103,232 IPv6 addresses I've yet to figure out
I don't know either
people will need to learn how to ban ranges now :p
IPv6 will make that interesting, indeed ;p
or there's be mass murdering in regards to ban evasion
there'll*
yeah
IPv6 is starting to remind me of the way IPv4 went when it was first incepted
and when bots start to use it...
Heh?
Wasn't there :p
they handed out whole /8's to big corporations like candy at the beginning
then there was much scrambling over trying to claw/reclaim/buy them back
when address space started becomming scarce
lol /8s? that's insane
class C block of IPs
or something
But heh, atm I'm like "grab the IPv6 while you can!"
indeed, that's usually the best, have a small block and expand when you need it
I have quite a lot of blocks atm
was gonna put an IPv6 IP on island but universehosting is retarded and hasn't responded to my request for the free IPv6 IP they say they provide
and I'm not even sure what the biggest block of IPv6 is atm
pity, the ircd sometimes needs a little coaxing in regards to the config file when adding it, and needs to be compiled with ipv6 support
is it /24 or something? or still /8?
And yeah
it needs listen [ipv6IP]:port;
newer versions support things like [ipv6], but older are silly and request you puy all IPv4's in the form of ::ffff:<ipv4> or something similar
put*
oh god
that's what it looks like when linking
it's pretty annoying
Yeah
I hate compiling with IPv6 support as well
Because it makes the link notices look like piles of unreadable crap
like anope's databases
okay, not that bad, but hopefully you get the gist
very much so, and poor you if you have scripts that have to parse it *coughs*
and yeah, that too x.x
need to dash sadly, I've got a bit of packing to do, leaving the country tomorrow for norway ;p
Ah, seeya :p
I need to sleep now anyway
I'll still be online semi-regurlarly while away incase anything explodes
Ah, well, have fun etc.
My school still dislikes me connecting elsewhere so getting on via SSH at school is impossible, though I'll be on IRC using CGI:IRC
Thanks, and sleep well ;p

12sounds almost exactly like DK64
It be meme.
*megusta*
actually DK64's music was using the Same sound samples as BK
I made a meme last night with RBD
started as a typo, quickly grew, hoping it will spread
What was it?
7stupid gnome :P
I told him to 'sjut up'
if it was GRON i said it first
sjut is a newly coined word :D
lol
Sjut.You created a new word my friend!
it can be used as an expletive and replacement for shut or shit
i g2g shopping real soon : /
as in'Sjut! I just stepped in dog sjut."
or, if you're feeling adventurous, it can be used in place of 'just' as in 'sjut leave me alone'
google image sjut: http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_oDm9fGP3SdA/SCNdoUm79DI/AAAAAAAAAtQ/43OHNKHFdB8/s320/SJUT+External+Informational+Pamplet+012.jpg
mainly, we told each other to sjut up all night
First. pic.
sjtu the fuck up

just shut up! teehee
sjut it

you're sjutting me right?
sjut sjut the ...fuck up, you little piece of sjut
3 uses guys
top that
sjut, I sjut the door of my vlocked car and I sjut stepped in dog sjut (4)
shit just shut - still only 3 uses man
oh, we also invented vlock, but it isn't as funny
vlock = cock block
or lock
YOU CHALLENGING ME LOCK?CHALLENGE ACCEPTED.
bro...vlocked me out of her pants, that sjut's not cool
they star with the memes so young these days

newdcd: THAT SJUTS NOT COOL NIGGA
reticentsmolder you seen the DCD video?
RainBroDash and I are going to try and coin it in this weeks BMN
no, linkie? or was it the one from friday?
coin it? what's that?
you have to *coin* a new term or phrase in order for it to catch on, like Stephen Colbert coined: 'truthiness'
ah
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tI2wJiZYeW8&feature=channel_video_title
link
often dictionaries will allude to where and when a term was first coined
oh yeah, I've seen it :D fav'd on my youtube acct

so I needed boxes so I could pack up my room
And I'm a target so I went to the back to see if we had a couple
What do you guys think about a MLP:FiM/Yugioh fic based on the Bonds Beyond Time movie?
Apparently I went back there as they were packing them into our truck for recycling
And they hadn't been baled
So I got tons of boxes
nope.jpg I'm sorry, I used to be a fan of yugioh (still have my deck) but I lost interest in it long ago
ah
enough that I'm considering being a child and making a city out of it

A shipfic XD
I see
02Soo... do you have a full Steam acount, or just the limited one? .-.
Lol, that's a new ship
I'll post it here when it's done
Are you still doing the WW one?
Yeah, but I'm at an impasse right now
I'll go ahead and transfer what I have to a Google Doc and let you look it over, k?
06Steam rating I'm not sure, I think it depends on how many different games you play recently or something
If ya want, yea, I can do a sort of mini review
They haven't gotten to Hyrule, yet, though
Just one question... Can a water spout actually slice someone to ribbons?
02Ah I see
06Well Shiny does have terraria so I guess he has the full one
06he could add me as a friend too, so yeah
02Guess so XD
Don't they get to Hyrule after like ages of sailing and adventuring aniways?
Actually -
I could do it that way.
It's an industrial process to cut very thick metal into shapes using a water spout
ah
But this involves Indian Sand, very very tough fine sand.
So yes it can, but normally cuz of other things in the water :P
I've seen it mahself - one LOUD process
so a naturally occurring water spout in the middle of the ocean can't?
but it cuts to like 1/100th of a mm or something ridiculous, and is uberthin =]
Uhhhmmmm
That i don't know
hm
but i don't think so ... ? it's water
hmm
Does someone get chopped up or something?
I was planning on having them get caught in a freak storm on their way and being tossed by a tornado, like how Cyclos does to Link if you take too lonjg with him.
long*
Ah, off to the eye docter. Seeya later everypony
K
But ... does a pony get sliced to bits?
Well, see ya in a bit RDash
I haven't aqctually written that part, yet
actually*
I was asking if it was possible so I'd know whether or not to use it
but it would just be a sailor
Oh ok
none of the main characters will be hurt that way
I Don't think so myself but it's not something I know about
I did give AJ seasickness, though
>mfw typing 'can waterspout' and google suggests 'kill you'
Lol! sounds about rite!
lol
Eyup
water can't slice through anything
just rip/tear
you need glass/sand/other stuff within it
So...the sailor could be blown into the sea and drown? eyedunno
wazzap
WAZAAAAAAAAAA huffythemagicdragon
Zaaaaaaaaaaaaa
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAhahahaha
WHAAAAAAZAAAAAAAAA
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAp
dat it?
i guess
i got two things to shar w/ u gaiz already for this friday
Oh?
yo wanna hear the 1st 1?
and the second second, yes
K i'm gunna ask everyone what they think would happen if the mane six played silent library
/me floofs
Look what this true heart of a human said: I have a form of Autism called Asperger's Syndrome .For years I kept my diagnosis in the closet,for fear of being ostracised or misunderstood by the people around me.Now as an adult,I'm learning that Autism doesn't have to define who I am,but is only one part of who I am.
...advocate for us,rather than spew hateful propoganda.
What's silent library?
So bloody true.
never seen it? its on Mtv2
funny as hell'
So you're gonna ask everyone about it? why not write a fic?
cuz i'm busy
/me fluufs
the second is gonna be the origin of bronyism in canada
thats all
ok
BAI
so you're gonna ask everyone stuff on friday?
/me sprawls on Shiny =w=
/me sprawls out under Espeon
what did I miss?
