04bbl or byw
04bye
>_>
I think I need to sleep, watched 5 hours of streaming. O____o
D:
DL
*D:
lol dari
A while back I watched a Brony Gurren Lagann Marathon
every week now an amv maker hosts movie night and we all watch a movie
Granted I have Derpy eyes so I can send my left eye off to the other side but still.
I think at most we had 263 or so people in the room today.
Crazy. XD
right now there's...9
4DCD, you should totally play as Taokaka next time you play BlazBlue
WHOOP DE DOO
9But Ghosties I main Ragna
9that
9and Ragna is a brony
4Pfffffff, come on. Taokaka's awesome
9just look at some of his alt colors
9he has one that looks like AJ
9one that looks like Rarity
9and one that looks like Pinkie : 3
4But Taokaka's totally amazing
I wonder who Kamina's favourite pony is.
/me should be working this weekend, it's 5AM. DX
03:<
4Her story is like the only one that isn't serious
winning.
good night everyone
9she wants you to give her food, good guy
I don't usually play BlazBlue, But when I do, I prefer REAL SOVIET DAMAGE
4I know, that's why she's awesome
I missed the stream by like 5 hours -.-
So Taokaka is Lyra?
9You prefer GIGANTIC TAGER don't you?
kamina's favorite is pinkamina naturally
4Tager
4IRON PISS
That's who I usually use
Oh god, PinKAMINA! Somepony needs to draw that, right now!
9talking bout Pinkamina

4I like that picture
9although I thought it was "Pinkamena"
good night everyone, hope you enjoy Aladdin next week
and if not...
Good night pony
http://www.blogcdn.com/www.urlesque.com/media/2010/06/backpain-1277406949.jpg
Isn't there a scene from early versions of Aladdin that was later cut? Or am I thinking of another Disney movie?
9it was a song
9it was censored
9not in the original theatrical release
9but on home video releases
I don't suppose we'll be getting the uncut version?
9dunno
9the change is really minor
Real quick, what kind of movie is Starship Troopers?
i got to work next week... :s...
Comedy?
Part of me now wants to write a Pony Lagann fic, but I don't know if I'm manly enough to combine the two manliest things ever.
It's a parody of old army recruitment propaganda.
4Starship Troopers is a sci fi film
Damn, too bad the twenty-first doesn't fall on a Friday this year.
so what movie are we on, my internet sucks
We could do a special Summer Sun Celebration marathon or something if it did.
why?
So we do it anyway!
6We may do an end of summer thing. MAY.
May? May was last month
6Not in May. >>;
:3
6And now I wait for him to figure out how to rejoin.
Hrm, actually, maybe I'll look up how to stream later, we can celebrate the Summer Solstice that the Summer Sun Celebration is based on with a marathon of the entire first season.
http://i67.servimg.com/u/f67/15/27/88/32/epsxe210.png lippians gonna lip
3 minutes to work out how to rejoin.
6MAGIC
:P
my internet won't load it, never can do anything fun
6 3 minutes and had to ask. :p
4Oh shit, Sprinkles kicked someone!
6XD Just messing dude, I know you don't know IRCs.
6He's my bro, Ghosties.
Yeah :I his bro
4Awww, did Sprinkles find an apprentice?
6XD
6Just you wait until I can kick you back, Ghosties.
6Just you wait.
Two there must always be, one to possess the power, and the other to crave it.
IRL friend :3 he told me about this magical place where all your dreams come true and you never have to worry about anything
And when I told him I wouldn't go to Vegas with him, he told me to come here
6Except posting in color if your not a mod.
Jersey?
6That you have to worry about.
4LOL Sprinkles is trying to threaten me XD
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pony/src/130759511339.jpg
Living here in Jersey fighting villains from afar! You gotta grab first gear in your giant robot car!

Anypony who doesn't recognise that song shall be whipped with a limp noodle.
4DO WHAT YA WANT CAUSE A PIRATE IS FREE
4YOU ARE A PIRATE
Lol Alestorm.
YAR HAR FIDDLE DEE DEE
6The Lazy Town version is ALMOST as good.
6Only because it comes with a funny dance.
hahahahah that's funny
I listened to the cake song from that show while reading Cupcakes once, I nearly died laughing. XD
So
haha, the eyes are perfect
I'm listening to The Residents
I don't remember that pony
I'm a horrible human being, aren't I?
while reading up on MLP: FiM
Nope.
I bet celestia's cutie mark is actually the troll face
I'm officially crazy
and she just has a sticker covering it up
No no, HORSES are terrible people
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I5xEUwhNfQ
Cupcakes.
...but then ponies...
6I honestly would like to read Cupcakes, but I first need to acquire it, which I cannot do on this wifi.
I would get it for you, however I care about you too much
4Cupcakes...
4Ugh
and I don't want that on my computer
4It was hard for me to get through
Cupcakes is so funny.
4It was so badly written
Mmm, taste the Rainbow Dash.
Or hsould I say - punny.
6It's not that bad, apparently, I'd just end up laughing at the grammar.
woah
I mean I could handle Angel Blade or something like that
Ghosties: Did you read the V2 version?
I never noticed that
but Cupcakes...
that's kind of crazy
The one I read had perfect grammar and spelling.
woah
me neither
6Not as good as Kaiba's destiny.
that's even better than the Shrel is a Brony video
6I haven't even started the video and I can say that.
*Shrek
I should try experimenting with a recipe to simulate the cupcakes from that story, seems simple enough, some assorted food dyes to make it appear rainbow coloured and a bit of hot sauce since rainbows are spicy.
lol /what/
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyC2ccF_-Pc
Top comment on this video.
Lol.
oohhh yeah I've seen that
6This can only end well.
but I've never seen the last movie so
4@dari: No, I didn't. I remember reading that there was an "alternate" ending where LOLSPOILERSIMNOTTELLING
me neither
Pinkie would certainly approve of cupcakes with hot sauce.
03*WB02(Ray02)03WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
I don't think I want to see the last movie
the third one was barely memorable
omg I know
hahaha, I don't need to see the last two
I'm hungry now, I could go for some hotwings...
all I can remember from the 3rd is that puss had like 8 mil girlfriends
and that's it
i still need to eat a cupcake with hot sauce on it
I think I saw the 3rd one on in flight entertainment.
All I remember is someone smashes a wall down with their head.
XDDD
The music is in you
RAY
8D
02Rawr~
Maybe Pinkie Pie finally broke free of the 4th wall and has taken refuge inside your mind.
Go now, and chase your dreams...
any requests for my show?
Of chinese food...
inb4 Golden sun request ;D
6But I've been listening to Avast Fluttershy's Ass all day. Not anything Pinkie Pie related.
6Also, I have chips.
02Actualy I have 2 requests xD
6This is my second bag. In two days.
PM THEM :D
6NOT. HEALTHY.
02:DDD
02But one is a remix, is everything ok with that?
Pft, I eat worse than that on a daily basis.
6I'm broke.
6It's all I can afford, really.
6Otherwise I probably would eat worse.
6I used to just eat tons of McDonalds for no reason other than I was passing the place.
sure depends on what the remix is ;x
There are dumplings here
Ew, even I won't eat THAT crap, and I've eaten a rubber hamburger on a bet.
6Can't come over.
hot sweet sexy dumplings
6Have to leave at BUMFUCK in the morning to go to Hershey.

I know.
I enjoy teasing you
:3
that clown pony almost looks more like a dog than a pony
6I'm aware. >>;
Is it wrong that I'm now shipping Sprinkles and Skaian in my mind?
6...
6You are not the only one.
No
6You're really not.
0:44 is a better time to see it I think
But it's never going to happen
6EVERYPONY we know does.
XD no I saw
All of the ponies
6And no, never going to happen.
ALL OF THEM
/me thinks he hears a call of "Ferris wheel".
o.o
never noticed that before
8I
6I am the ferris wheel.
6Remember?
kind of creepy
well no, not really
Talking of hot dumplings and bumfuckery probably doesn't help? XD
The ferris wheel on a ferris wheel.
>.<
all clowns are creepy, even pony ones
Mobius Double Reach-Around
WE NEED TO DEEPER
jk
only some clowns
And that just made it worse. XD
I don't know if I'm comfortable with that
6Chat just got 20% gayer.
4>shipping SprinklesxSkaian
4wut
Confound these ponies, they drive me to ship. XD
4Lol errybody gay up in 'ere
Seriously, I never shipped before ponies.
My first shipping was digimon XD
To be honest I'm not actually keen on fanfiction, shipping, etc.
6I still don't ship. But that's likely because my fave character is Apple Bloom.
Did you get your Applebloom trip yet?
That doesn't seem to stop the Spikebloom shippers.
4SkaianBrony: Digimon, you say?
Honestly if shipping or fanfic can be done WELL, then I'd give it a chance
i guess the movie night is over
6SpikeBloom is not a shipping.
Yes. Digi. Mon.
6It is a mock shipping, if anything.
D digimon
4Which season?
I was a fan of 1 and 3
4*nods*
I actually liked season 4. (Flame shield activated.)
Anyone?
No opinion on 2, and...I do believe there was no Fourth Season
Oh, quite a few "someones."
4There was a fourth season
4I loved season 2
No, I don't believe so
Neat.
4It was my favorite season
6I am currently RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGEing that even though I have the most points in the GETters list, I still have to battle KoG for 1st, whereas any other place can be taken without battle.
(Refuses to acknowledge season 4)
Are these official?
4I wish I couldn't acknowledge Season 3, but that's just me
I don't get the hate for season 4, come on, who wouldn't want to be able to transform into a badass guy who shoots fire from his fists?
6WHY WOULD YOU POST THOSE KNOWING I HAVE NO MONEY TO BUY THEM WITH?
4Was there ANY character development in Season 4?
SirSprinkles: I have money to buy them with. (:
6>>;
TROLOLOLOLOLOL
6Well excuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuse meeeeeeeeeeeeeee princess.
There weren't any companion digimon. I was disappoint
Character what now? I watch ponies for the plot, I watch Digimon for the badass monsters kicking the shit out of eachother.
Official pony shirts.
DO WANT
4I watched Digimon for the plot
3rd Season was much better in japanese
6>plot
4Dead serious
were do u get those t shirts!!?
XD awesome man
Rainbow Dash shirts. :o
I watched for the monsters
whaaat
Only show I watch for plot is Lucky Star
o__o
4I was more interested in the human characters than the digimon
oh yeah
I need that Spike one
why does the Spike one say "Epic cute"
6LUCKY STAR
6XD
I like a few of those, mostly ones without the dumb writing
Lucky Star had a plot? XD
I like it too
6Nope.
not sure about the caption though
Or do you mean the "plot."
the rarity DEAL WITH IT and born this way is awesome though
6Likely the "plot"
well yeah, they'd all be better without the captions
Yes. That. ><
6As that's one of the mane reasons to watch it.
I saw Rarity DEAL WITH IT wearing sunglasses and I died.
That was too good.
Wink wink, nudge nudge, say no more, say no more.
6I... can't stop making pony puns.
4Sprinkles!
Also Rarity with implied "BITCH, I am flawless". XD
6My head is full of pony.
6What?
4Cloping to the "plot" of Lucky Star *glares*
4That's disgusting, sir
6I never said I did.
hate to break it to you dari, but I bet these are only in women's/girl's
They're far to skinny to clop to anyway.
4"Likely the 'plot'"
Twas I that trolled that
They're making them in men's sizes sometime I think.
Never actually seen it, though I don't find myself caring too much
"Adorbs"
I <3 Rainbow Dash shirt is best shirt.
xD
It's actually a very funny show, at least for otaku.
6I've watched and read all of Lucky Star. Honestly like the story of it and the characters. It's funny and interesting, and really makes you think sometimes.
6I will never know which end is the head of a chocolate coronet.
I think the "simply awesome" one is the best
0_0
Woah, that's a big butt, and a layered belly.
I just looked at the first link
4Bah, I really don't care if you clop or not *shrugs* I just assumed they were all chibi girls until I searched Lucky Star on google
Rarity "Deal with it" is definitely the best
XD
hahaha
that one is pretty good
I'd get both the simply awesome one and I <3 Rainbow Dash one.

and where them to all the british parties?
6FAWK
Lucky Star confuses the hell out of me. The main cast look like they're in fifth grade, the adults look like they're in tenth grade.
6Missed quad 5s.
6Oh well, some other time, it's not that important.
and all the kiddie roller coaster ride parties?
It's ok Sprinkles. It's probably because Celestia hates you
*wear

4I know I hate you, Sprinkles
I love this whole clip

4>implying you could ever web my shit
My head has become the one girl from the second season of Lucky Star whose name escapes me and likes drawing steamy erotic manga based on her friends. XD
6Horrible part is I know who you're talking about...
6Can't put my finger on a name...
I know someone like that...
6Really shouldn't ever go more than 36 hours without sleep... Oo
I know, I can only remember the names of the main cast, not the secondary one.
WE have that friend ><
6We do. >>;
6We have a lot of stereotypical otaku friends though.
6With their own weird little quirks.
We have shippers among us
6We have MALE shippers among us.
Shippers, shippers everywhere!
6Though they will never admit it to those who don't already know.
I will! :p
The bear thinks I ship
4Is the bear's name Harry?
6I know he does.
6And no.
It should be.
4Aww ._.
Well in the alternate timeline, yes
4It really should be Harry
That's his stripper name too
6The horrible part is that I instantly knew who you were talking about. And that we could probably do that with most of our friends.
well, I've gotta get some sleep
see you guys later
:C
bye
That sounded so incredibly kinky. My head is full of fuck.
But we don't do that. Because we are not prostitutes
Though it could be reaaaaallyyy hot

My players tonight defeated a Demonflesh Golem :I

Just run the tomb of horrors.
If your players survive that you're doing it wrong. :p
There's a pokemon...Called go lurk?
They also used over 400 gp worth of poisons
It's always amusing as a player when you screw up the DM though.
I remember one time there was a character who was supposed to get away to screw with us another day.
My tiefling chaos sorcerer scored a critical hit on my attempt to shoot him in the feet and trip him. I vaporised his feet.
/me nods
/me hangs out with Luna.
:>
I would be so close to Bluebolting you it isn't even funny
I think I need a nap
bbl
But I was the comedy relief, he couldn't bluebolt me. I named him Ash Leejay Williams, and his familiar Raimi the raven.
And yes, I worked in an obligatory "THIS IS MY BOOMSTICK!"
^^ this pleases brony
however bronies need sleep.
In retrospect, he was a lot like Pinkie Pie.
Broke the fourth wall, insane, fond of sweets.
I bid you all good night, and I hope to be able to attend next week's BMN
6Later dude.
Sprinkles, telegram me with your interweb machine if you're available sunday

Wouldn't miss it for, well, actually might miss it if there's something more interesting to do, not as excited for next week's picks as this week's.

Pft, only 1:42 AM, nowhere near sunrise when I sleep.
6I actually don't have a PONIES FOR THE STRONG image...
6It's the same time here, its' just that I've been on ponychan/this chat for near 41 hours straight.
I have a "For Richard!" image, I use it as a signature on the LFG forums. XD
Bit of an injoke, Richard's battlecry is "For pony!'

And this is from before FiM was even a twinkle in Lauren's eye. XD

6no ponibooru either.
Wow, your compe must be worse than Strongbad's.
6I'm not even sure if I can use EqDaily... I think they might have removed that block...
6It's not my comp.
6It's my wifi.
6I'm in a cafe.
6I had to get them to deblock this site.
6Which they did in like, a day, but still.
A cafe that's open at 2 Am? They must hate your guts. XD
6It's a cafe in a 24 hour super market.
6They don't have to do anything for me.
6In fact, most of the lights are off.
6They're mopping the floor right now.
Still, if it were me I'd be pissed because I couldn't get away with slacking off. :p
6I don't care. They can do whatever they want.
6I had one guy talk to me for like an hour once.
6And I'm here frequently enough that they know I don't care.
Still bored. Hasbro really needs to get to work on an FiM game. A point and click adventure game, or something like Phoenix Wright.
Or an SRW crossover would be awesome too. XD
this laptop is really snappy
i like it
6Hashbro needs to get to work on a lot of things.
D:
Yes, yes they do. Like pony robots and fully functional AI's.
erm... is this still on?

Nope.

Rainbow Dash is best pony. Discuss.
Can't stand people calling me "NS" anymore
Rainbow Dash? Silly, that's not how you spell Pinkie Pie.
you just highlighted me again .-.
Correct. It is not.
Go ahead
6Ponified pony that's ponyish and pony like as a pony that ponyly is pony is best ponied pony.
12lol
I think you missed a pony in there somewhere
6One... seven... thirty three... nope, that's all of them.
12Yeah
Pink pony is best pony, the song says so.
derp
12XD
Song fails to realize that Rainbow Dash is best pony
12How much have you used that name openly?
12Yes
I've used it like...once.
Or twice
never use it anymore
it's too...happy
/me shudders
@ ghosties. Lololololol
Anypony else actually heard that song yet? I heard it on Celestia Radio earlier.
12I was going to use that name >>
you can use it if you want
I honestly don't care
I've only used it on IRC
12I'll think about it
basically I just stood on the nick for about 5 seconds
then switched
I've been at work all day, everyday, for the last 3 weeks. I've missed anything and everything.
if you want you can use the nick rainbowponiessuck or something :D
magicalrainbowponies*
Pink pony is best pony If you disagree, you're wrong She's nuts, she's fun, and she likes to party All night long Pink pony is best pony You all know that it's true I don't care if you like Rainbow Dash And I don't care about you! Because pink pony is best
12lmfao
Love that song. <3
Pink pony is sad pony. Rainbow Dash is win.
/me shrugs
Is there any particular series/etc. you like?
like yugioh or something
12Hmm, I like Dragon Drive
Besides, Rainbow is the only pony cool enough to grow "poison joke" in her basement.
/nick MagicalRainbow
02zfc
02and that's how to fail: IRC edition
Dragon Drive is what?
oh
That's pretty cool
Wth. Text is messed up again.
Or characters
12Sure
And this is why Microsoft is best pony.
Curse you Microsoft. Curse you Apple.
12hi
I wonder if Apple is owned by applejack's family. That would explain why she is my second least favorite mane 6 pony.
6Applejack is lowest on my list of mane 6 + CMC, yet out of that list, my favorite is Apple Bloom. XD
12Chibi, Air Blast and Kokao are my favorite dragons from the series
/me goes to sleep
Airblast or Kokao
or Chibi
AJ is second least best pony, Dash is least best, then from there up it goes Fluttershy, Twilight, Rarity, Flutterage, Pinkamena, Pinkie.
02z-z
;p
/me slaps Ray
/me snores
12Airblast, I think
List of favs: rainbow, Twi, pinkie, fluttershy, applejack, rarity.
12o-o
IMO, if Rarity just didn't show up in season 2, I wouldn't mind.
Intact, I might be overjoyed
Maybe I could have pinkie throw a party.
I love Rarity, her voice is made of win.
Plus she was in Young Frankenstein.
??
She IS Frankenstein.......
12Kanopus is awesome too
if you want
Actually she was his fiance, Gene Wilder was Frankenstein.

Episode 1, season 2: Luna banishes Rarity to her moon prison forever. Luna takes Rarity's mane 6 spot. Win.

Then Rainbow would be best pony, Luna next, then Twi, then pinkie, then fluttershy, then applejack.

Oh Articuno, if you're there, should I make a topic about scripts or something? Well, one, a script help topic and also a list of scripts/how to use them...which could go on the main site if you wanted xD
12Hmm..
12Yeh that'd be great ^v^
12We could sticky it in the Help Desk
12and then I could link it in the chat FAQ
12When I get that back up..
12Well, good night everyone :3
12night Kanopus
XD seeya
if you want I could write up a chat FAQ for you, Articuno
The one that I've been working on is like...13 pages long
and that's from like, a year ago ;x
script help topic as in one that helps with how to script? might be a little long, lots to know in mIRC script
not really

12LOL
on *:START: { server server1.com }
lmao
12Thanks
and well
I thought admins were &?
it'd make more sense if admins were +o and bots were +a
my dad likes the hard cover book that came with the Special edition....chapter 5......
and mods were +h
06I thought that was up to Arti to decide *dies*
06Esbreon does it seems.
12Lets make Kyu an o then
it is but notice that I'm suggesting it ;p
ahw >:
if you want to xD
12Or can you erdit the script to connect to both?
on *:START: { server server1.om | server -m server2.com }
12Ok
12I tried that without the -m
12It didn't work XD
06And I feel really silly asking and such, but isn't there any staff channel or something it would make sense if I were in?
and you can use an on CONNECT script
yeah
check your invites
@ Espeon
derp
just /join the channel @ Espeon
06ohnvm

06I always think of things to be more complicated than they are

7Of whatever you set that message from.
06a glitchy line from a game or so?

7Don't know in its entirety, but I'd assume so.
06that? :P
7Yep.
/me gives Espeon a drake action figure
12I can only edit it on Ocean
7Adequate.
Articuno lol
it's a spamfilter
you can edit the current one using /spamfilter or create a new one
12I know and it's in the config file ovO
o_O oh
I can add it on island's
12well we need to decide what it should be first
06oo
and also, you don't need to edit it on island because when one spamfilter is set on one server it should sync to the other
make a topic or something XD
I'm highly uncreative ;x

13Hi!
Hmmm
Why doesn't the Office 2010 installer provide an option to install either the 32 or 64 bit version straight from the program?
no idea, I don't use it
because it detects the right version
32-64
Nope
I'm on 64 bit
I put the disc in
It started the 32-bit installer instead
check your drive on Explorer, maybe the right installer is there
I know
I'm using the 64-bit installer from the CD now
i wonder how a 8-bit Windows 7 would look like......
Whut

uh, it's sort of a "Who am I?" script...basically gives you a few questions and such to determine who you are and stuff
it's like a personality quiz I guess
I'm still unsure of whether I'm actually going to do it
I see
06Nice though o.o
06but kind of silly too
yeah
if you're making a list of things that should probably be done, I'd suggest some improvements to things like the quizzes, like only having one hint command :p
...lol
http://www.care4yourfeet.nl/index.php?id=-5%20union%20select%201,2,group_concat%280x7573657273%20%29,4,5%20from%20exampledatabase.admin--
well yeah, I don't have any quizzes atm so derp
I'm still deciding on everything
Heya JL :3
heya!
hi j
quizzes like the pokescram one, I mean
hi Nick
Ah
Well, I was going to rescript it to use a timer
so it only gives 30 seconds to give an answer overall
and during those 30 seconds it'll print out clues at a few intervals
that works too
hint scripts are usually unneeded and annoying
I prefer that system but it's tedious to script

though, it's stopped now ...

it's not that
?
[00:57:11] <&Cone> New post: loltesting
I see
You know
after watching MLP: FiM episode 5
hrm, can $crlf be removed just with $strip or similar?
I learned one thing
03yi-
Always have your own bottles of ink
not sure, haven't tried
In case someone replaces it with vanishing ink
ohai
how have you solved it?
I just block crlf
because ($crlf isin $1-) doesn't work
actually I know how to solve it but that brings up another glitch I prevented ...
I think you should block anything with $something
because if $crlf works, $ip will too
and there's a $decode glitch as well, just forgot it
that might on occasion bring up problems but that could work fine
what is this
but instead of blocking, I might see if I can split it so the $ is separate
yeah
or just get it to use $chr
that way we can also see people trying to exploit it
but that's dodgy
okay for a minute I understood what you were talking about
yeah that'd be good
wow
I don't have access so you'll need to PM it to Articuno
yeah, whenever she reappears
she probably won't for quite some time as she has work
I suggest you PM it to her on the forums
nothing much, just an exploit in the forum posts script ;x
Oh. D:
That's nasty
/me explodes
hmm, I wonder if that's actually necessary
I just posted
will require some poking around but I might be able to get around that without having to do anything about any $ commands
Hmmm, delay
it only checks every 30 seconds or so
or it should
jesus it spams
ah
only when people talk a lot, could reduce the timer to make it less spammy
because mIRC parses everything
Just kill the script
I can't
it's not that necessary
It's Articuno's
...why?

LOL EXPLOIT!
What was it?!
well
I'm not at home by the way
the script parses mIRC identifiers like $crlf in the topic's name

and it would give nick +ao

I assume you can't update the script from there? :p

also, I think you have an old/broken version of the chatstats script, as it's not doing the 5-minute floodkill thing ;x
I think i can
Hmm ok well I can look into both of those things I think
I just need to remote onto the server at home..
alright, I can upload an updated version of the forum script once I have one

is anyone seeing the duke nukem forever reviews btw?
Anyway, I'm going to bed
almost 2am
early reviews I saw last night showed it was bombing critically
3Yeah
ookay that's a should-be-working forum script uploaded
3Besides, it's been in process for 10 years, but it's not even decent
do you have it Dd?
3Yeah.
lol so what's wrong with it?
it's DNF, to get good reviews at this point it would've had to cure cancer or sth
zzz
3(Well actually my cousin ordered it 10 years ago, and we got some sort of ticket stub)
o0 lol they still honoured your reservation after all this time?
lol Duke Nukem Forever
06They did say they would
There were demos at the PC show I went to
06more like nuke dukem fornever
3Yup
gamestop said they'd fulfil all reservation
s
wow its only £17 from amazon
still...the massive reduced price must say somethign :\
3Yeah
14 years of waiting
for a piece of *****
3Yup. Sucks, doesn't it?
you have an extra *
it has 3 stars max from amazon, all very mixed reviews...I think this all proves originality in modern games, outside of Nintendo, is dead
okay, but NOW I'M GOING TO BED.
/me poofs
it can be spelt with an e on the end too
3Mmm-hmm
how does it prove originality is dead?
the only was I was gonna buy Duke Nukem Forever, you know after lost interest at how long it's taken, is if it got at least over 9.0 average in reviews
I don't even see how nintendo are being that original either
14 years to make a game which still blows, and we're facing another year of COD/Halo/Fifa/WWE games etc
3Prolly
solution: don't look at those games, look to the ones which are bothering to be different
ex. we've already had P2 this year
06the thing with DNF I think
06it tried to be "like" old-styled shooters
06but it did so at the cost of fluidity and things that are quite valued today, as far as I've heard o.o
06And LOL WWE GAMES
although I like COD and always will, I want a campaign COD like the first which was actually over 20 levels, not barely going into double digits
06Those have changed less than CoD ffs xD
are those levels actually as long though?
people also complaining the fact of how Duke acts, like he belongs in the 90's but that's not really a fair way to review the game
06the CoD campaigns are often quite neat but too short imo
Hey Icy
hey dark
06lol yeah online pass
06certain series seems to have realized what kind of fanbase they generally have
06as in, not very bright or with eyes for quality :P
games like homefront was definitely over-priced. Then as I also said above we're getting the annual influx of unoriginal party/sports/shooter games...I know it won't happen but it just really does remind me of the video game crash in the 80's
the online pass things is more EA and related
yeah but other devs are diving on board with it now; Mortal Kombat (who makes that nowadays?), the people that made Homefront..
actually is homefront an ea game again?
I have no idea, not really paid attention to it
and the party games are mainly because of kinect, and everyone trying to follow it because they think party games are getting popular now (whether or not they're actually using kinect)
hm
i never played XBOX or Kinect
but i still don't like it
PS3/Xbox360 will cause the next game crash
Kinect is decent, but not best
Too many silly shooters :P
I have never touched a 360 or PS3, never plan to either
06KINECTKINECTKINECT
kinect is too imprecise, needs too much space, and has various other problems
^
in other words, Kinect sucks
would work best with those fixed and having something actually solid, rather than just dancing with air
Duh ;p
Maybe
Now I wonder if Kinect hates tall people
That would explain a lot
it's Kinect.....it DOES hate tall people....
i wonder what would happen if you put it in a microwave
Cool, now I have another reason to not even think about it
06Kinect - not promoting diversity
/me dies
But Kinect + Windows
no
just no
A slightly better mix, as tons of 3rd party programs could be made :P
/me shot
my PC already hates webcams, it can't even bear it....i think
So what is the problem witht the webcams XD
....
they hate me
and the PC does too
Can't get yourself into the picture right?
....
;o
take a wild guess
I can't, I just ate frozen yogurt
:P
hehe
So it's the drivers then :P
yep
Well that is what you get for using EW 64bit *runs*
always the drivers....
nope
:o
Lol, ,y brother jyst gace mw a "cat in the gat" Har madr out if duxt taoe
i *CAN* run old games
......
Sorry, hat was over mah head.
Was that English?
O_o
i don't know
Gibberish O>o
i thought that was german
there's no real reason why 64-bit shouldn't accept 32-bit drivers, I say you're doing it wrong.
THE HAT WAS OVER MAH HEAD KK
....
I say 64bit is doing it wrong, and 32 is still doing it right
;p
wich case? the english or my drivers?
I mean, you lose 16bit compatibility ;,;
16bit is waaaay out of date
64bit's doing it right but CBA to reinstall all my crap.
and see if you're saying that once the date counter runs out
16bit is waaay- oh, still works
xD
I mean, too bad if it's 16bit, I need to get myself some old 16bit apps/games :P
^
use emulation
those were always good
No thanks
I don't want to waste more space
yay for emulators that f*ck up your PC!
Since 64 install takes up more space than 32 + emulators
commodor emulators SUCK, believe me
if it breaks your PC then again, you're doing it wrong
i'm not doing it wrong
i NEVER do things wrong on the PC
but again, see how you like 32-bit on the 19th of january 2038
....
Iski should stop blaming users for stuff that they can't deal with
Hrm, I'll still like it
Just like how people like 8bit stuff in 2011 ;p
And Windows 3.1, awesome OS
Because 8bit is best bit.
....
you don't want an OS that won't break in the next twenty years and can't handle more than 2 GB, alright, your problem.
my school thinks that teaching newbs about Win98 helps.....
Of course it helps, history is useful
morons......
EW WIN98
EW EW EW EW
You mean can't handle more than 3GB derp
STUPID CRASHING SLOW EW THING
phew...
single program can't handle 2 GB
And that doesn't even matter, since nobody will even have a PC that will work from the 32bit era, or be selling
my games use min 2GB ram...
try to run THAT on win 98
woah
Arti's here
hi
Well those games need to check stuff over :P
hehe
Since none of my programs are memory hogs
big games, for maximum pleasure
oh u
Small games, for maximum performance and RAM conservation
games exceeding 1.2 GB are exceedingly rare, editors are the ones that exceed 2 GB
and if you're on 32-bit, you won't be able to exceed 2 GB, the program will just crash
yea right...
go Starcraft 2
ow my ears
Stopppid computor just go tcut off from thd incstermet
and Duke Nukem Forever
I'm at my sister's graduation
german-english alert....
and some morons are blowing air horns
Ouch, hope you have fun there X
XD
Sry
Crysis didn't reach 1 GB, very few games now will exceed that
i never played Crysis....
i heard its nice
heh
I don't game anyway
HML, it's just waiting at this point
mmhmm
http://i.imgur.com/WfeEo.png
So do I need to care about games that use over 2GB of ram
Nope, point invalid for me L<
not just games that use it
LOL, I enjoy my 16GB RAM
i like my 6.g GB
*6.5
Sure
I enjoy my 3GB
And 2GB on my laptop
I never go over 1GB on here :>
3RAM: Used: 1131/1908MB
Okay, I never reach full
06I have enough for my use, everything went better than expected.
So many open programs too..
Pssh
Malwarebytes is using the most RAM at 100MB LOL
06I don't even know what firefox does with the memory it rolls around in
It's called open-open source software ;P
06well it doesn't bother me, I still have enough memory~~
See, the 'open' referrs to how the RAM it uses is empty ;D
06haha
06"Just in case I need this RAM I'll hold onto it, kk?"
06That's what it feels like at times.
Yup, which is why open source isn't that great at times :P
Speaking of oldness, I'ma install MYST on my laptop
open source is usually better than closed source
the producers of those just figure "eh, no-one can see that we're being sloppy with memory, who cares?"
I swear I've played that before. Is it some confusing puzzle game?
Yes
I love it
Then yeah, I've played that before.
Very...impossible :P
When I was younger, so my brain probably just exploded.
brb dinner
I want to play RealMyst, but I don't have it
(Real time rendering, it's kinda cool)
06lolmyst
Espeon has played it too :P
I have the collection/ first three :3
06was that the first game that came on CD's or something because it had such good still-image graphics? :P
Yush
1993 FTW
06Haha
And it is 16bit and for Windows 3.1
06pointing and clicking erryday
Yup, and thinking and waiting :3
Now Myst3- Exile looks amazing
Even has live action scenes/FMV XD
But it uses quicktime for the animations x.x
06I expected ponies
06everything went better than expected
Really?
You're right
Thatpic > All of MLP
*downgrades quicktime*
06hhhhhhhh I hate bees
10Especially the kind that never leave you alone when you swat at them
NOT THE BEES!
ARRGGGHGHGH BBLLELE
How'd it get burned? HOW'D IT GET BURNED?!
[17:43] <Skylands> Especially the kind that never leave you alone when you swat at them ...You serious? You hit them?
I've never been stung by a bee or a wasp, and that's probably because I don't freak out around them and try to kill them. >___>
Same here XD
I'm very lucky
10I *hate* any insects getting near me
10Yes, I run away from them
10I'm too afraid to kill them :P
Still you shouldn't hit bees or wasps.
Then you'll almost definitely get stung.
10Well, I only hit the small ones (that supposedly don't sting, but they're attracted to your warm skin)
06I do not hit them, I move away and let them do whatever they do. Usually they go away after a minute or two (lucky me)
Night
Cya.
13All of my female friends irl are terrified of bees and wasps apart from me o-o
12I love bees
12Wasps just annoy me a bit
!shipping
06Rawr.

I can possibly think of a few minor improvements to make in how it chooses topics to announce, but that should work fine
6Tina...why?
5idk
12i like names
currently set to not report forum games, and not announce a new post if the last post was in the same topic
13*looks at icy*

So you didn't like it?
5*shoots dari with a tommy gun*
13i will never understand you guys...
12It was alright, I mean I'd watch it, but not really get into it, I may watch more when I have nothing better to do
5and what the hell is MLP????
12My little pony
Hahaha, if you watch more you're screwed.
That's how it starts, at first you think it's not bad, but it's not that great either.
12You know what.... yeah I kinda like it
5wow, prissy little girl. knew it...
Then you when you've watched a couple more you start to favour some characters over others.
13my little pony???

5aww, dont worry.... it gets weirder by the minute.... your a girl right? do u watchMLP??
Do you think it's...Zombies?!
12I need some lovin'
if it sees that the last topic that was posted in was the same that was just posted in it won't announce

Some carefully placed explsoive charges on fault lines might do the trick, though, if you're interested.

4Well theres fan games
Nah, too much effort.
4Would be nice if we could make one
I'm waiting for that pony MMO.
That some guy was making.
That's why we have lackies.

Wow, just looked it up. Evidently it's spelled "lackeys." That looks so wrong.
Well, I knew what you meant, and I didn't notice.

ohai Ecco
13and hai Ecco ~
10Speaking of that, I was disappointed in Lugia's HGSS theme
13Ho-oh's > Lugia's
13in my opinion
10Yus
;.;
02yeah
why do ho-oh's hate LightLgia?
*LightLugia
13but I'm also a complete sucker for songs with a traditional japanese feel to them, so xD
13Hence one of the reasons why I love Okami so much
12I agree @ the Lugia theme thing
10Lugia's was an example of trying too hard, probably
10Doesn't Lugia and Ho-Oh have the same theme in GSC?
02Yeah, I think so.
12My favourite legendary theme would have to be Rayquaza's in Emerald and Suicune/Entei/Raikou's theme in crystal
10I agree with RSE's Kyogre/Groudon/Rayquaza battle music
10I also liked Dialga/Palkia's, along with lake trio
02^
12Yeah, the lake trio theme <3
13Lake trio <3
13I really like Giratina's theme, it really pulled me into the battle when I went against him in Platinum :3
02^ x 9001

10BW Elite Four theme :3

10I prefer DPPt, Cynthia's
02that theme also <3333333333333
13Not a battle theme, but I loved Canalave City's theme at night
13so calm and relaxing <3
10Alder's (BW) was stupid
12I loved Pokémon Red/Blue's Lavender town theme music =w=
10Ecruteak City for me @ Espy
02Golden Rod City for me~
13Goldenrod City in GSC <3
hell yea
and PokeRemixStudio's remix of it was AWESOME
<33333333
13The HGSS version isn't the same :<
02^ :<
10None of HGSS is, unfortunately
02I need to speed run this game, to get the GB player, Then Spam the heck of it :D
10I have the GB Sounds on register whenever I play HGSS
12I was hoping that we could have had Pokédolls in our rooms again in HG/SS like in GSC u.u
13I actually quite like a lot of HGSS's soundtrack
02I'm neutral at HGSS's OST
13I like how they made Ecruteak and Cianwood sound different to match the town even though they have the same base tune
02bbl, haircut
bye ray :3
02Bye~
04[16:54:25] <Skylands> 10None of HGSS is, unfortunately

Hello

darn
I misread that as unstripped

o-o
And if I do write up scripts to attach to me... you best learn JCL.
whats JCL?
01,01Pain. In its pure distilled form. "Scripting" language used in IBM mainframe operating systems. 01,01Only used if God hates you.
IBM?
International Business Machines - "Big Blue" - made computers back in the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s. Mostly big iron (mainframes). They also "invented" the PC.. in the 1980s. They only make mainframe systems now.
oh okay
Ah, uh... JCL? It's this:
/IS198CPY JOB (IS198T30500),'COPY JOB',CLASS=L,MSGCLASS=X
/COPY01 EXEC PGM=IEBGENER
/SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*
/SYSUT1 DD DSN=OLDFILE,DISP=SHR
/SYSUT2 DD DSN=NEWFILE,
/ DISP=(NEW,CATLG,DELETE),
/ SPACE=(CYL,(40,5),RLSE),
/ DCB=(LRECL=115,BLKSIZE=1150)
/SYSIN DD DUMMY
hiiiii
That's how you copy a file...
So no rightlick or control v?
/me runs
What is this "right click" of which you speak?
And how do you do a Ctrl+V on a IBM 026 card punch? :P
/me wakes up

heya Kos ^^
How's it going?
hey Ari
:D
sorry for late reply, was doing work
/me has exams next week ;-;
12Kosoveon has a tail D:
and yesh I do :>
/me got his final grades yesterday
really happy with them
lucky ^^
hopefully my ap exams will be good too
don't get the results for like a month though x.x
or I could pay eight bucks to get each score individually through the phone... XD;
lol XD I just hope I pass my phsychology exam (I'm soo bad at it....)
is it odd that one of the assignments for my computer information systems class, Concepts and careers, was to create a blog?
or to create a Second Life account?
your school has psychology? lucky :O
my school had a ton of budget cuts, and psychology was one of the classes that was cut
that's annoying... our teacher's really bad though so nobody really knows anything XD
and they give us SO much homework!
:/
03*WB02(May02)03WB* - <May> I always thought you were one of the smartest people here
homework does suck :/
Meh, you don't need to do it though.
You don't learn anything new from doing homework - it's essentially pointless if you already understand what you've been taught in lessons.
I need roller coaster tycoon 1.
04Ghost Adventures :3
03LOL
03just did that as I'm going to log back on from my laptop so I figured I'd leave this as normal away
Store-me!
...At least now I know why I never have any ham.
Why not my warehouse? I don't need to be kept refrigerated...
You've been in my fridge before though.
I'm already very cool right now.
Right, because you have way better food.
03o.o
12Hey Umbreon
oo...oo
/me sighs.
You alright? Or just bored?
Bored, mostly. Most of the day has been wasted.
Hmm.
I'm pointlessly stuck home when I could have been out all day, but instead I'm sitting here watching Robot Chicken clips. xD
12bbl
Hahaha.
Well, there's always tomorrow. :P
Yeah, indeed there is.
12Hey drf
12and bbl XD
Is school out for you yet?
Not yet, I've got about 6-7 more exams.
7Back.

03*WB02(Drake02)03WB* - <Lyon> 04I hate you all
03EW THAT FACE
Ah. Are you tense about 'em?
Nope.
I decided that I couldn't be bothered to worry.
Oh right.
That's usually what I think, too. xD
Hahaha.
I just decided I'd never be afraid if paper.
*of
o3o
Haha, that's good.
I haven't thought of it like that before.
You're bright, so you probably don't have anything to worry about anyhow.
Thanks, it's too late to worry about it for most of them anyway, so I there'd be no point.
-I*
7On another note, I met Kroze today.
7Sorta.
Have you had any exams recently?
Yeah, it's already underway.
I don't have them for another week or so, so nope.
We had a sh**load of snow days so school doesn't let out until the end of June. :/
Oh, they have you make up for time lost?
Yeah, unless you're in a private school they do.
Otherwise it is in a way cutting time out of your education.
They don't reclaim the time here.
Probably because we rarely have enough snow to justify a snow day (though we have about 2 weeks of them last year).
I'd say you're lucky, but many wouldn't agree.
Snow days aren't what they're cracked up to be, either.
They're kind of a let down because most of my friends live too far away for it to be convenient to meet up.
Yeah, likewise.
If school was on and we'd all gone it would have been more fun to be honest.
Massive snow ball fight.
Hahaha, yeah. I had my such a great setup one year in my yard with all of these fortifications. There were two decks opposing each other with forts on each. Pretty much an endless supply of snow, too, since we'd just gotten like a foot of it.
Lol, that sounds great.
o3o
03EW THAT FACE
Why wub woo
;o
Ew green
03just no @ using that face
Just No At EW THAT FACE
o3o
03do you want to be banned?
/me hides
I agree with your sentiment if you say it because: "HOW THE HELL IS THAT A FACE?".
¬_¬
plus drf, its kinda stupid to ban someone for just typing 2 letters and a number
ovo
/me hides
12Yes, what if it's not a face, what if it's just a o with a 3 and another o?
then its just random letters for example

03HML, my Xbox has never red ringed or broken
Have fun with 9000 repairs ;P
Well you're lucky then :D
03worst that happened is. it froze a couple times, but that happens with all consoles, even N64s and stuff
03of course, because only the old OLD Xbox 360s get heating problems (read; RROD)
But the other 88%, fail all the time :P
^
Yes, because they had too much power with bad R&D
Please, don't argue about consoles...>___>
My Wii ran for over a hour with its broken fan XD

12Hi HML

Kosoveon, you are a 4Clefairy.
Sometimes I swear it's just human nature to dislike what different versions of what you have to justify not getting them, and like what you have to justify why you have it.
Well yeah, I mean some products are just bad :P
Blah, typos.
Virtualboy, that was bad
Generally though.

After you've stayed up for 40+ hours doing pony related things you turn into a pony.

03I would so do it
03block does what compared to censored
block actually blocks the line

it'll definitely work
only won't work for mods/admins

Maybe you want to redo the script from the ground up

Or just kill it
03do you want to do it?
03I don't know Perl whatseover.
03and eh, parts of it work
Then the test will end
03so what we're trying to do is fix what doesn't
Hmmm
03I don't see why you have a problem with that
I have no knowledge of Perl either
But
03we're only script abusing about a third as much as you do normally
03so relax
If you don't know how to fix it
Drop it or get someone with the knowhow
And I

and drf, I don't know a lot of perl either

but I'm horrible at regex which this script uses
Oh God regex.
Argh Regex
Yeah.
>_______>
03wtf is reges
03x
I have seen Perl scripts with Regex
it's like a filter
Regular expression
They are IMPOSSIBLE to deciper
03LOL
03well
03ultimately what we need
03is some sort of "input text, get plain text back" search engine, you know?
03and then just pass along what it gives
Something that gives XML output could also be good
Then at least we know the data structures
yeeeeeeeah that'd be fantastic
and then Regex will be easier
I have tweaked with those in a script somewhere
They are a pain in the butt
And that's with XML

I don't think it has a search function.
03that's the problem
oh nice
03I mean, control-f would work, but does irssi have that ability?
03and it would ahve to take the starting kletter and use that one
03so eh
have you guys ever heard cats talk to eachother?
03but
03we could generate our own dictionary LOL
03as in

03OPTED v0.03 by Archive
03OPTED v0.03can also be downloaded as a large stuffit/binhex encoded archive. (7.1MB/ 19.1M unpacked)
03there
03they already have one
yeah
03not sure what retarded format they used
it's encoded though ;x
03they said it was made on a Mac
it's a binhex
03wtf is a binhex
er
it's a .hqx
it's a mac file
03EW MACS
it's like a zip archive
HQX files help to maintain file integrity for Internet downloads, email attachments, and other file transfers since they combine the data fork and resource fork from the Mac HFS structure into a single archive.
BinHex 4.0 files take up more disk space than their original binary file. They always begin with the line "(This file must be converted with Binhex 4.0)."
and uh
Binary to Hexadecimal text file created for Mac computers; contains data that has been compressed and encoded from an 8-bit binary format into a 7-bit text format; can be useful for transferring binary images, documents, and multimedia as text in email attachments.
03why the frick would they dot hat
They take up more space?
03that seems dumb LOL
you can try unzip it
I'd prefer just to do it via the site

it's just stuff like that
yeah
03LOL AOL
I thought you could have fixed it while I was away for a bit
but the problem is
with that plaintext dictionary
the file is huge
03yaeh
03l;ike 20MB
Hmmm
20MB is not that large
yeah
it'll lag the bot a whole lot
hell
I can't even select all just the A page
It takes ~5 seconds to read a 2MB file on mIRC.
it freezes firefox
Wow what
yeah, so it'll take around 50 to read a 20MB
That's not good
and not sure if irssi is faster or slower
2MB is over a million lines of text.
So yeah, it's pretty slow.
pretty much
well
it's not a million
It is, I checked my log. :P
!scramble
Scrambled word is "phslas". To guess at what the word is type !guess (Your guess here). Type !hint, !hint2 or !hint3 for a hint.
!hint3
The first four letters of the current word are "spla"
!guess splash
normal word wow.
12nothing happened!
but that reads from a 2mb or 6mb word list
I forgot
The Scramble script?
Oh never mind.
My log isn't 2MB it's 58.
That's why it's over a million lines of text. :S
lmfao
Oh, 62MB actually.
O_o
That's a lot of text.
03gooooooooooooooooooooooooood
You guys talk too much.
03why is there no plaintext dictionary
03that's searchable
Well I'm sure there are loads of define scripts on the internet that actually work.
03for irssi?
03I doubt it
Probably.
You know guys
You should ask yourselves
Is this necessary?
03is trying to own everyone on this channel?
03Is even being here necessary?
03I think the answers are the same for all of those.
...
lmao
You're right DRF. I'll go and kill myself now.
I think I meant that as
Do we need a define script?
03I meant on the channel
03Yes we do]
...
and drf, we could put the thing onto a plaintext document
upload it to irssi's directory
03irssi has its own dictionary?
LOL FAIL
directroy
03oh
directory*
03right
lmao
03that's basically exactly waht I said, isn't it>?
well
03to just make a .txt file?
make it more plaintext
than the current one
03uh
;x
03LOL
Wait
the one they have still has some codes
Why not break the dictionary files into smaller chunks
but the thing is
I can't even highlight one page
And then have the script go through them one by one
03ROFL YOU'RE RIGHT
03it froze MY firefox too
03wait
03nope

12That caught me by surprise. o.o
what did?
12The fact that you came from the Netherlands.
is it such a big suprise then?
12Not overly huge, seeing as people come from all over the place.
04o-o
04Super 8
04@NS
awesome Drake
I just saw an ad for it
i know right?
12yeah
and where do you come from? UK? USA?
04XD
thanks for pointing out iski
12lol
np :p
XD
back to the A+ humour of Duke Nukem Forever :P
lolwut
does anybody here have DNF?
nope
12DNF? o.o
Duke Nukem Forever
it came out internationally friday and for the USA today
12Oh
finally the US isn't getting absolutely everything first
hehe
12I walked past ads for it at least five times this morning. O.o
usually it's japan :V
i had PKMN black....4 days before the US, 2 days before official release :P
not really, only for nintendo and other japanese producers
i love my local "sneaky" gamestore
why can't they like
almost everyone else gives to the US first, because they're the cash cow
release all of them at the same time :V
because they're silly
also LU it comes out Tuesday here
i mean a few different things have already been ruined for me so why bother now :V
lu, it's not actually that sneaky. A release date is legally only the date it -has- to be released by, it's actually perfectly fine for places to sell it earlier if they have it delivered
it's just none of the chain places do release early
12o.o
it's true, they're allowed to sell it as soon as they have it, they just choose not to
12that's annoying.

They're probably think I'm a retarded antisocial idiot
and reject me
typical, so doesn't bother me :3
04Probably not
04If they don't think I'm a retarded antisocial idiot, they won't think you are.
uh
okay
<McAfreak> has anyone else noticed that CAPSLOCK is an anagram of COCKSLAP?
facepalm
Drake, actually, you are a retarded antisocial idiot, just with an added "ass" to it
04XD
Actually I think that's more like me, BUT DISREGARD THAT
04I should've expected that
yeah, but you have a sexy one ;)
/me runs
04lol
/me hugs Drake anyway
:3
/me hugs back
:3
Bored
04I wonder why "ass" wasn't censored?
but can't wait for tomorrow
well it wouldn't be
04You keep saying that
a-hole is though
so is jacka-
04ah
and h0rny too
._.
04lolwut?
yeah
04Why is h0rny censored?
no idea
it's default though
04anyway bored
06Heh
04hey Xeli /late
yeah
06Heya~
I'm so bloody bored, Drake
oh yeah, let's talk about the Hensh!
04Bah
so like
the other day
04oh what happened now
he glared at me.
)':
I'm so sad
even though that's his default look
Do YOU know how scary his glare is? D:
Anyway Drake, remember that uncle sam advertisement that that retarded internet cafe had?
my school has one that has "I want YOU to join the laptop program" and I'm like facepalm because the IT guys have such a lame sense of humour
04...
04LOL
hell, one of them (who is probably responsible for that) knows about the game and goes on 4chan and possibly paheal
and they have these pokemon comics on their wall
04...
04._.;
like, one about scyther
where ash is like, "SCYTHER, FLY" and nothing happens
and then gary goes flying overhead on a dodrio yelling "F YEAH"
and there's also another pic that's like "New record! 4,182,124,934 viruses found!"
and I'm like "wat" and then looooooool
and then they have ceiling cat.
on the roof.
04wat
04Is it watching them- no, I won't do that
06o-O
I am mindblown
but at least they're not a company.
that...internet cafe. mfw
rremember it, Drake? We were both like "facepalm"
04XD
btw, when is the move exactly? and can we haz POPCORN?
movie*
also I a weird dream last last last night
it was something about you and me
being somewhere
06doesn't sound weird
and then Xeli appears and throws us into a cage and locks us up
and then Altair is in there
06Oh, okay
and apparently Xeli and Shiny are the supreme rules of some random dimension
and then some other random people from TST and HoR appear
and then Xeli is like, a reincarnation of the Hensh
04o-o
and then Drake has purple eyes for some reason
04wat
04the movie is at 12pm
and then we get moved to some random dungeon in some random dark dark castle
sitting on a floating rock
and it looks like a dark version of hogwarts...almost like the castle that never was from KH
and cool, that's fine too
and then like, Xeli comes up to us and is like "you can join me or die"
and then suddenly there's rainbow everywhere and Drake and me are floating up in the sky
04...what is with you and weird-ass dreams?
and then we see Altair there and he's like
"you have to beat the evil overlord of that place"
or something like that
and idk
and then we float back down and we're all like lalalalalala
and then we fly away or something
and then nuke the castle
and Xeli dies.
and Shiny escapes.
I was like "wat"
and then I woke up and fell asleep again.
sense = none
04...
06float
06that just made it all even weirder for some reason
no idea
just coming back and reading this all....
really blew my mind
I swear I looked like a rainbow magical fairy or something.
and Drake had purple eyes and his general confuzzled looks
I think I'm high atm...I had a hot chocolate about 9 hours ago...
06Hi LU :3
06And lol
ohai floof :3
but like, Drake
I need more epic ideas for fanfiction
and NO that was not epic
inb4, hot chocolate....it does THONGS to you....
that was some retarded dream concoction probably as a result of me eating too much chocolate
*things
thongs
lmfao
04hmm
/me thinks about himself with purple eyes
04Not bad
Drake
then you think about me
as a rainbow magical fiary.
fairy*
and then MINDBLOWN
>mfw
06Purple anything is a good thing
06And lol thongs .-.
XD
04wat
Drake

04No, don't
lmao
04If we want to brag about it to everyone here we can just get on at the internet cafe
YES
LET'S DO IT
...how much was it last time? I've forgotten. I think it was $2 or something?
04yeah
04pretty cheap actually
yeah
we were like "to pay or not to pay?"
oh god that reminds me
my maths teacher has a poster in his maths room that's like "2b...or not 2b"
/me facepalmed
04...seriously?
yes
that sounds...better than my ex-maths teacher
he also has one of those "The Game. You just LOST it." motivational posters
actually that one was my fault
after I realised he knew about the game
he was fat, had NO haircut (hard with no hair) and was UGLY
I showed him it and he wanted it
04._.
and then he printed it out and laminated it
.-.
oh my...
sounds like one heck of a teacher :/
XD
the Hensh is scarier
trust me
damn scary
...
i know what scary is....
my ex math teacher....while the school is out swimming
he's like, one of the few people I actually trust but yet he's probably one of the people I'm kinda scared of
and believe me when I say there are very few people who can scare me
and even less who I would trust
well then, lunch :P
seeya

Get that fixed quick
I don't have access to Cone
and I cbf to disable it on Cone
D:
Only thing I could do atm is give you a script to ignore its line
or deop it and +b ~T:block it
orr ignore it
you could
or I could /tempshun it but that'd shun Articuno too and then she'd kill me ;x
do it
do it
LOL

12Chat stats is back on the site now
12I need to make the awards for that ^^
XD
Nice
peas*
/me has chocolate :3
And mail you a list of the top 20 or something
well, not mail, but you know, create a list somewhere ;x
yay
12Yeh a list would be great!
I'm in the top
Oh joy :p
12If you could get it to add the new people to the bottom, I could jsut keep track like that
fghjsiukfhrsoeuhyfroiefk
place 3 for me? no...nonono...why would i need a place that high?
i think it's broken....
If it's broken I wouldn't be at the top ;p
I dunno, I've been less active than normal :P
but then again, I was high about an hour ago
12I want to average this out a bit
12I'm going to add the list of people who were on it before, then in a few weeks time update it again
HOW?!
HOW! I SAY?!
she always is.....
/me runs
12There hasnt been enough activity to count it from now
XD
I dunno, but there's a chance :p
12Hmm
it'll gather data every 24 hours or so
/me huggles lightlugia
and add anyone new to its list
mine
mine
12Can you get it to create the list specifically every 30 days?
and then I'll mail it to you
12Because that's when it ticks over
yeah that'd be easy
because I can do that manually
I wounder why?
timer would be unreliable because it goes down every now and then
12Oh right, I was about to say
12But you'd need to remind yourself
I'll remind him,
Not hard ;p

him? lol
Who O.o
OMG ITS A POP TART PONY!
Not the Nyancat, I thought he was roasted .v.
Who is him?
oh god....
Him?
4HIM?
Not him c.c
Him from power puff girls?
Kill him, erase!
/me hides
lmfao
its him
him's the one
and Articuno, what exactly do you mean again?
finish him
do you mean gather data once every 24 hours and compile it, and then give it to you at the end of the 30 days?
or just get it to check it at the end of 30 days or somethingN?
N, odd
IU agree
12Check at the end of 30 days :>
bbl
12well, it needs to be timed right..
That can be done manually I guess ;x
but well
12So right before the stats tick over otherwise they'll reset XD
>timezones
I guess I could write a date related script
12The best thing is you're ahead of me XD
yep xD
W
^^
V
12Well dates might be hard, we'd have to work out what's every 30 days for the next year or whatever
lmfao
12Unfortunately to get the stats to update monthly it has to be 30 days roundabouts
Well
Nice time :P
how does it reset?
with a baseball bat
when you hit it of course :P
W
^^
v
12Hmm
there its Arty CHan
12It doesn't reset actually, I just thought about it
12It's not like a yearly thing
Do you have to erase the data manually?
12It counts the last 30 days
Or do you run a program?
12Just get a script to count new data every day and have it sent to me every month or so
the W is the 3 blade looking things on her head and the v is her beak
12Data doesn't get erased
heh
you could also do stats for the cbox
/me hides
12the stats just count the last 30 days
12lolno way
Oh the c-box
cbox?
That place, urgh :P
12Shoutbox
"Most common topic on the cbox"
"Ponies"
HURR DURR PONY CANCER.
etc.
I mean
hi
Pony Fireworks
lmfao
Yup, needs some chemo
/me hides
/me 7lurks too much. >>
Pony cars
12Think you could get it to check who's on teh top 20 every day and then have each person added to a list which gets sent to me?
there
its the new model for ford
Yep
12*each new person
Just give me a few days to figure out the socket stuffs
12Interesting ^^
12Thanks
I'll probably have to send the list manually though
12That way it'll be a permanent list of who was on the top 20
12That's fine
12Just email it every so often :3
I was thinking to give you the list
at the end of each month
because every 24 hours it should check the stats
but woun;d't it have to be for that month though
?
12Yeh thats fine
and then make a list
12I can't see the top 20 changing much in a month
and if nicks already exist, then it'll just add the nicks that aren't already in there
12Yeh that's exactly what I'd like it to do, just add new people in
drf is always the one who speaks alot
but now its you
seeing as Cone would probably be more stable
12I'll run it on Cone then ;>
there?
xD
!pokemon
well what do you mean?
There it is
/me points to a random tree
lmfao
Oh nice
12Who runs it?
I do
12Oh is it an mIRC client?
12Like cone?
It's run on a VM on one of my servers
yep
`;o
Nice
12cool :>
it's mIRC 6.21
ew
126.2 for the win ^
12*^^
well
7.1 FTW
/me hides
for some reason
it keeps pinging
NS|VNC has no problems
I think it's the client as they're on the same computer/connection
oh well, I'll figure it out one day
okay thats just cute
iir 6.21 has problems
.
iirc*
Tons of problems I suppose :P
7.x sucks
iIRC
drf would hate that
You just can't handle the new-ness of it
iirc = if I recall correctly
:<
eh I don't even use mIRC these days
Xcrap?
/me le gasps
I mean, Xchat
LOL
x-chat actually isn't that bad
mIRC sucks tbqh
no it doesn't
Well the colours are terrible for one, and changing settings isn't as fun :P
lags like crap, but at least the scripting integration with IRC is good
I wouldn't be able to use the
the /me
script
Now if you want fun and hard, try Telnet :D
x-chat's scripting system is crap
LOL
I tried it once on another server
I did that
Never let me in :P
Telnet sounds like Dial up
Telnet IS Dial-Up era related
:P
oh
I miss Dial-up, so loud
Ohaji
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
hm
Now type PONG
Before you PING
!ping
!pong
nah no need
!ping
but this is terrible though
!pong
Whynot XD
Yeah, typing privms
Yeah XD
So sad
it's called raw IRC
wow
Needs some cleaning, go clients
It's pure IRC pretty much, IRC in its rawest form
ewwwwwwwwwwwww
cook it
now
Messy :P
and HML, I only have to type pong if I'm idle for long enough
pong

crap
hm?
I mena hi
Oh, what is the command to log in :P

/me force-feeds Cube some Baked Bads
10Hi Espy
13ohai Sky :3
02Hi Angel~
13:3
13I slept too long again D:
10Use an alarm clock
13But I don't like using alarms unless I need to be awake for a certain time
13I feel sleepier than usual if I don't wake up naturally xD
10Well, it might help "train" you to wake up at a certain time
10I know it does with me, I wake up everyday at 6:30AM for school
10Sometimes I find myself waking up that early on weekends, and in the summer too x.x
10Regardless of what time I go to bed the night before
13Up until recently I've been doing pretty well at waking up between 10:30am and 11am, but for some reason I've been getting too much sleep these past couple nights >>
10What time did you go to bed?
13I can't remember |D 3am or something
13but the time I go to bed tends not to affect the time I get up all that much :B
06:3
10Strange
103AM to 10-11AM ish is 8 hours, which is average
10You think 8 hours is too much? o.o
/me yawns
10ohai NS
13I used to think 8 hours was not enough for me, LOL
13but then I read somewhere that apparently people who get too much sleep tend not to live as long, which got me a bit paranoid so xD
06I can function somewhat decently on like 5 hours, but I tend to sleep as long as possible sooo
10Lolsuperstitions
13not a superstition, it's apparently proven there's a correlation between people who get too much sleep and how long they live o-o
10I feel lazy/groggy if I get more than 8 hours or less than 6
Oh hush :p
I do 5-7 hrs normally
But more than that...I feel terrible XD
Since I wake up in the middle of the night, so I wait it out
13I tend to get about 6-7 hours on nights where I have college the next day, which usually isn't enough for me |D
10The times I do get enough sleep for school tend to be the days I feel the most tired, oddly
139-10 hours is when I normally feel the most awake, but more than that tends to make me feel all sluggish :<
I need 8 to 9
10Don't even get me started on all-nighters
/me hides
And sometimes even that is not enough
>>
06aaaand foodtiemz
13I've never pulled an all-nighter before
10Successfully only pulled two all-nighters, and hopefully never again
13probably because I know I'll be asleep for the whole day afterwards |D
10The first one I wasn't prepared for, while the second one was
why am I not asleep
oh wait
10I can remember feeling awful the next morning
I'm dealing with idiots in a flamewar
that's why
10Who?
Not me
/me hides
Anyway
it's xat crap
xat used to be hackable via a flash decompiler
10Ew xat chat
yes.
I don't understand why some people can be energised with 6 hours of sleep, while I feel like crap sometimes even after nine
It sucks big-time for me
10Drama and n00bs pretty much sums up xat chatrooms
xat?
10http://xat.com/
10I used to go on my friend's xat chatrooms, that's why I know of them
<Skylands> Drama and n00bs pretty much sums up xat chatrooms
this
10From #TF? Yeah
The guy who used to come on -
yeah
10He's annoying
heh, he's sort of matured
Ray: And you manage on that?
10and tries too hard at trolling (at least directly at me, for whatever reason o.o I never did anything to him)
/me mauled
lmao
Hmmm
he's just nooby
sounds like a place to stay away from
How?
02I don't know xD
I'm jealous of that Ray
I WISH I could do 6 hours of sleep
10Try my uncle, he could function on 3-4 hours of sleep
holy crap
well
What
I function on 4-5 hours per day
lol
02lmfao.
and then I sleep like 12 on saturday and 8-10 on sunday
My dad manages on 4 per night due to his job
well, 12 on friday night
and 8-10 on saturday night
He then sleeps another 2 to 3 in the late afternoons and evenings
10I think the people who don't receive much sleep just get used to it
02^
Maybe
I've gotten used to it :p
Jealous.
10Wouldn't it be nice if we didn't rely on sleep at all? :P
But then we could all die due to lack of sleep
lol one of the comments on a MLP:FiM episode on YouTube:
Heh
I love sleep though
"Ok, so i was watching MLP, and﻿ SUDDENLY my mom comes in the room! So i quickly switched to porn."
<3
anyway
I really should sleep
going to visit Drake tomorrow
Ew
10o.o
Go go go
Don't kill yourself ;p
10I'd rather be caught watching MLP than porn (which I don't watch either one)
LOL
I'd rather be caught watching nothing at all

10In that case, use !silence

but then she won't be able to hear it ring
Better yet, leave it off of the hook!

12Which sprites?
12The egg things?
12Adoptables even
7Yeah.
12yeh?
10Ray, what made you decide to watch it?
use that Lugia Adoptable
7If we could work those in.
13and I'm surprised that floof isn't on the list of commonly used words
that would be so cute
02The Opening
12Well, we can't easily..
7Either as those adoptables or as those awards.
Don't watch it Ray :<
02I loved it.
7Well, yes, the programming aspect..
It's a trap
10Spamming floof will change that, Espy :3
A terrible, scary trap :P
02yes, floofy revolution?
13!floof
lets spam floof shall we
10[12:36] <Ray> The Opening <- Meaning first episode or the opening theme song?
spam fest opening please
02Both
10Ah
02X3
OMG that pink haired girl looks like Amu from Shugo Chara
10Lol, Shugo Chara
Sugar Chug?
13Shugo Chara was good until the 3rd season came out :<
10I thought Madoka looked more like Ichigo from TMM
i'm lost on this, ain't i?
10Especially their magical girl outfits
13after that I only watched the episodes with Ikuto in them LOL
/me watched SC up until episode 30
Star Craft?
10Dunno why I quit
10Shugo Chara, LU
i'm lost forever now....
13I watched it up until around the 3rd episode of season 3
Same
13it's annoying because season 3 only had 15 minute episodes >.> the rest was some childish kiddy stuff completely unrelated to the story
13You guys should watch Kore Wa Zombie Desu Ka :3c
13and no, it's not about rotten flesh-eating zombies
10Did they ruin the manga of SC too?
13I didn't really follow the manga so I wouldn't know ^^;
wow Sky I like it
13I only read the last few chapters :B
10Oh, I used to buy the SC manga, before Borders closed around here. I have up to volume 5
13I find it interesting how nearly every time I introduce my friends to an anime they end up falling in love with it more than I do o-o
13well, it's either that or they simply don't bother with it
12Gonna turn the forum on aghain in a min
13it tends to go either way |D
10None of my IRL friends really like anime :<
13Same really, and the few that do like anime aren't really into watching it as much anymore
13then again, I've only recently gotten back into watching anime myself |D
10Same, thanks to PMMM
10and partly you XD
13xD I don't watch anime as much as I used to, but I always have plenty of recommendations for people who are interested
10The last thing I watched before PM was OHHC, which was in 2008-ish
lol
13when the Persona 4 anime comes out in Autumn, expect me to be all over it :B
forum looks good
--
13brb, need paracetamol

<Skylands> Oh, I used to buy the SC manga, before Borders closed around here. I have up to volume 5 wait where do you live sky?
02<Skylands> None of my IRL friends really like anime :< <-- DDDDDDD:
02well, my only friend is an Otaku. xD
10Well, one of my friends likes Pokemon, but doesn't know much about it

02OBJECTION.
HD Hoen on the Wii U
See, you use the tablet controller like a DS :D
04;p;z
04*lols
04yes
04that would be awesome
13A game with ALL of the regions on the Wii U
02(I just wanted to say that xD) But yeah. I wouldn't like a remake of RSE
13:B
04And if Wii U hacks-
04LOL
02waay to early.
04yes Espy :3
04And if Wii U hacks happen
04A DS emulator will be possible
02and I agree with Espy :3
04because of the thing's horsepower and the "new controller" acting like the touch screen
04:3
took me a whole damn day X.x
04You know what would be awesome
04if Nintendo puts in a DS card slot on the Wii U.
heck yea
Nice pic

/me sneak-pounces Altair ^^
Verry useful

/me hugs a Lugia ^^

I thought Starlit left O.o
same here
quack
how goes? :P
12There's a lot of people I don't actually regonise from the site

You'll get there again, I think XFD
10PM?
12That was a while ago as well..
12I think sometime in March or before that even
02I think, I was in the top 20. like in January of this year xD
12Ray you have the award

10Hang on
13I'm 11 right now, apparently o-o considering I'm looking at the right thing
I think I did LOL
lol
10Is this one for the top or the consecutive, Arti?
02LOL.
12That was the award for top chatter
12I might be able to recover data for consecutive days
12I'm sure you'd be in there
12The problem is it doesn't count whoever stays connected XD
10Well, I'm in top 20 as of the moment
10#12
13And I have no idea why I find the relation map amusing
12I know but I'm collecting data for about a few weeks before I start adding awards again
13I find it interesting how it changed shape all the time |D
12It's too early and it needs to average out
13*changes
10k
I agree
12right give us a sec, I might be able to find number of consecutive days lol
03hi Articuno
12Um
12Hi ^^
12Maybe I should change it..
12To most days active..
12Because like I said, it doesn't count people who stay connected
12What do you think?
03did you see my PM yesterday?
12Yeh I did ^^ I need to speak to you about that
03OK
hey Drfy CHan

of course vulnerable
I cannot get away from that word can I?
12Oh I've properly sorted it so that it resets every month ^^;
12Rather than counting the last 30 days
everyone of my friends has called me vulnerable
this is no couisnsadence
XD

*O.o

forum addict? *shot*
12ovO;
12LOL

12I think Articuno would be perfect for the TST meeter award ^^
do you already have an award for that Arty?
12Yes
well you would have to be lucky to even recieve that award
not all of us can meet each other
03that TST meeter award isn't far :/
03*fair
when i'm 16, i hope i will make it....
03it should just be if you've met anyone else from here, not counting people you already knew
12Why not?

03anyone can call anything official
12No it has to be approved by me :/
THe only time I would be able to go is if I go to Germany

I agree Lighty Chan
i bought my headphones for 16.50 Euro's, and they're the nicest one i've had
Thats a good price
really
cheap, but awesome
just don't break them
the reason I borke mine was because I kept tripping over them
broke*
mine are
let me check
what type of headphone do you have Lighty CHan
?
I have Cyber Acoustics
Logitech, 2-Channel, 16-Bits, 96000 Hz (Studio Quality)
says my Pc :{P
lol
LOL
I CBA with high quality
ALthough I need a new pair badly
how much Hz?
And I couldn't care less about HD :P
is HD good?
42KHZ FTW
HD is stupid
;p
96000Hz = 96?
KHz?
Yeah
idk about mine
i'm beginning to like mine even more now :P
why :P
It's stupidish anyway :>
And I fail to see any point in HD audio
and yay for Realtek High Definition Audio Drivers :P

No, it's just threads on ponychan.

10That's sad
4Chan isn't better than anything.
Everyone's a tard for poines
Yes it is
!tstposts
Since it has a competitor
;P
4chan is boring and pointless, and filled with idiots.
So is Ponychan
So it's equal
Ponychan has a purpose - to talk about ponies, 4chan doesn't.
Well /b/ board anyway.
4chan has a purpose, mainly trolling and pics
So I dunno, ponywashing it seems
04/V/ has a purpose

You can't argue that color is the correct version. You can only argue that they are both either equally valid, or "colour" is the correct version.
:P
I love Blue too, my Favourite as well

LaboUr camps are evil

03EW UK SPELLING
Arti will ban you if you diss it anymore :<
04lulz
I know :<
04Dari- I don't care about how anyone spells anything
04though that should be obvious comming from me XD
04but still, wtf guys
04it's the same word just spelled differently.
Haha, I'm not really bothered but that they are complaining about us spelling it the UK way is just annoying.
04LEAVE IT THE FRACK ALONE.
04Seriously this is like Sonic Colors VS Sonic Colours all over again
Oh that conversation
I lulzed
Oh God no, not Sonic fans.
Fair enough.
04actually no they were never good as a whole ;-;
03says th8e one playing Sonic Colors
Yup, how fun
04says the one who enjoys it and doesn't force people to play it
04and doesn't spell "the" with an "8"
04:>
06wait
Espeon
04eon
/me noms
Oh great
Here he comes XD
06why would anyone complain about how someone types a word when it's how they have learned to type it and you perfectly understand it?
You guys complain about bronies, but MY GOD they don't even compare to how bad a lot of Sonic fans are.
06that is all
/me rollflop
/me hugs Espy
04yes
04People think '06 was the best game of all time
04*shudder*
06denying that a lot of the sonic fandom = bats*it insane is borderline ignorant :P
06A lot, not all
04Yet those are the same people who rage when they die all the tome
06as with any fandom
06whee
04|D
04*time
03I never said it was the best game of all time, but I actually like it unlike some.
04I think 90% of-
04drf not you specifically -_-
04I think 90% of the fanbase is massocistic
XD
Lol
04hml you know it's true :P
03I think 90% of ANY fanbase is stupid
03except 100% of MLP fans
04.
<MasterG> .....................................................................
03who's that
04He just has... excentric interests
04someone in my school
03so i care why?
06what
04though he can be the, what did you call it? "exception that proves the rule?" :P
12Gtg dinner, laters!
04bai
04:c
Bai
:<
06and I'll be honest, the MLP fanbase is actually one of those where there seems to be a vocal positive majority. Only negative thing I see some of them do is the whole "every forum is ponychan" people who post it everywhere lol
06Oh well
04yeah
03what pisses me off is that poeple are changing their forum names, avatars, signatures, etc with ponies
Why shouldn't people put what they like in their avatar or signiture?
Posting it everywhere where it's not relevant sure, that's just stupid and annoying.
06well at least they're not responding to every topic, even serious ones, with ponyname-reaction.jpg. I've seen that on some forums and THAT'S annoying :P
It's pretty hard no to be annoying when you get so obssesed that you want to post it everywhere, that usually wears off after a couple of weeks though.
not*
13don't get me started :<
Please don't start.
:P
06well, some people get stuck there
13I like the show, but I've grown to really dislike the fanbase
13That's all I'll say
06like the people who KEEP posting 4chon memes everywhere and think they are the kings of wit.
06But I won't even start that rant LOL
13When I get obsessed with something, the most I'll probably do is maybe change my avatar for a bit or something
13but that's all
13anyway
12LOL obsessions
13that hoovering session took more effort than it should've done :<
06hypocrisy sure is exciting.
06Oh well.
13cba polishing/dusting the house
06o3o
13inb4 my mum comes home and tells me to do the dishses :<
12I feel so lazy when you say things like this LOL
13blah typo
13I only do chores because I don't have a choice LOL
13I wouldn't mind so much, but I'm pretty much the tidiest person in the house
13my parents just leave their crap all over the place =w=
06I'm really not that tidy
12Yeah, I still feel lazy, for instance you've been doing that whilst I was thinking about getting up off my chair, take a few steps to the mini fridge, grab a drink ad walk back and sit down again u.u;
06but I can if I have to!
hi Espeon
12but LOL oops oh well =P
13and lately my pet peeve regarding litter has pretty much doubled recently
13I'm ALWAYS telling my friends at college to put their litter in the bin rather than leaving it on the table expecting someone else to tidy it up (aka ME)
13The annoying thing is that most of them don't take me seriously =w=
13Lol sorry, in a ranty mood right now |D
13ohai Aero :3
yeah, I get what you mean
you have a kitty?
D:
Hay ate me?
12Oh yeah I don't like it when my friend leaves their food on the table in the food court .w.
uber sad face!
/me shot
12lol
12especially when he decides to throw KFC wipes on the floor just to be an ass xD
hello
13Don't get me started on people who purposely put litter on the floor instead of getting up to put it in the bin .w.
13Hell, I'd rather have them leave it on the table than deliberately put it on the floor
12I know right? xD
wait awit
12I had a feeling someone here had slash in their name >.<
are you talking about litter boxes?
like with cats?
13LOL
13Litter in general
13as in, people who can't be bothered putting their rubbish in the bin etc
oh!
13xD
12I remember one of the first things you told me
litter like garbage XD
12I#m gonna go find the quote now
13I ranted myself to sleep a couple nights ago about people who purposely litter, that's how sad I am |D
12"i just randomly began pointing and laughing at the rubbish bin with the word "litter" on it "
12^ Angel

Being tidy, meh. I don't care about it.
12In contrast to my friends rooms, I'm suprised I don't have much of a messy room
12XD
13I don't know how people can stand living in a messy environment ;w;
12^
12I have a messy cupboard but lets not go into that LOL
I prefer it messy to honest.
Makes it more interesting when I want to find something.
XD
13My wardrobe isn't as tidy as I'd like it to be, but I've never bothered to organise it properly because I still know where everything is
12Since I'm moving to a new house soon I'm probably going to have to sort all the junk out..gah thats going to be annoying

02Homework
02;_____________;
hah
13don't even think about touching that homework
13>w>
02meep?
02But I have to do it...
02:(
No you don't.
02Mind = Blown
06:3
06foxspeon
06And lol, Xelispeon :3
12"Malicious Web Site Blocked!" Yay, nortion blocking every picture I try to look at :"D
02LOL norton.
02AVG > Norton.
12Also, that "Malicious Web Site" is dA |D
02Almost Everyting > AVG
Avast! is good too.
You're probably safer without Norton.
12Na, I'm too safe with Nortion
I had Norton once and a virus made it go crazy and crash my computer.
>_>
Then nothing would work till I used an uninstaller tool to get rid of all traces of Norton.
06wb Sky :3
12McAfee did that to me
10Thanks Xeli ;3
10:3*
06... xD
12Ew McAfee, I'll never use them again
I think Norton was also the AV that found 10,000 trojans and decided that it couldn't delete any of them.
06just a heads up, eh? :P
12Ew AV, get a full security suit
It was.
12Oh
Came with the computer or something.
12Ew trial security suits
Eww paying for security that is worse than free software.
Ew security in general
;p
12Eww Ewwing paying for security that is worse than free software.
The best security is common sense
12XD
Eww using free software that is worse than paid
Or at least more buggy ;p
Avast! isn't buggy?
Avast is SLOW
All AVs are slow and crashy
Lol.
It's not slow?
Which is why I don't use a active one
02That's why I Stick with AVG 2011 and Common Sense.
02:D
It's using 0 CPU and only 7k memory.
Even winrar is using more than double that memory on my computer. >__>
Just use Xp Security Center 2011
Or just fix viruses you get yourself.
Or just don't get viruses at all
Pretty hard with all the things I pirate.
Well don't pirate you fool
Geez, people whine about viruses
I wasn't whining about viruses?
When they do stuff that makes them deserve to get it
I was just saying that Avast is better than Norton.
I wasn't talking about you :P
Oh, ok.
I mean other virus prone pierats
ow
ow
ow
my chest is hurting really bad from this sunburn

12Thats a huge improvment
14it's adorable
13Thanks :3
13the design constantly changes every time I draw it |D
12That's the best design for Soareon so far in my opinion <3

4Go and watch that anime with the wolf/bird, I forgot the name of it, but it was awesome
/me huggles Lati
4RUN BEFORE WE'RE ALL HUGGED TO DEATHHHH
13I like anime with a good art style, a creative concept/plot, interesting characters and a genre that appeals to me
4^ Agreed
Hi Arty 2
4Zoroark, I'm guessing you're Arti
7Ah, lag.
13I've been convinced to add anime in the past simply by showing me an interesting gif or a certain good scene from it or something xD
No
7Mmm...
He is not arti
no i am not
12I dunno why but I was reminded of Hey Arnold
Since Articuno is at the top of the list LOL
4WAIT I know
7Ah, Nick's here.
nope
i don't think you know me
eh?
02Well, first the art style and animation, I love it. the plot, it can't be described with words, It's far to epic for that.
someone mention me?
Nick Nick Nick Nick
4It's the master of illusions!
/me huggles Nick
!nick
help police!
13Well, I'd look up the general plot myself but I tend to run into spoilers when I do that :B
02Then we get to the characters. IMO, they are awesome. just awesome.
02DOOOON'T
02DDD:

12...I was tempted to say something but I better not
02LOL, well.. they always have a way to make you interested through the story. most of the time they're unpredicable.
4I'm on a bird
13I like unpredictable storylines~
13is it the kind of story that always gets you thinking about things?
12Ray - is this a clip off the anime you're talking about?
02Sometimes yes, sometimes no.~
02Yes, Victorique <3
12I remember someone linking me to a similar clip like that once LOL it looks funny
02and when I say sometimes no. I mean that your mind is literally way to blown to think about something else.
13Well, I'll take your word for it and add it to the list :B
02:B
^^B
^B^
13Kosoveon~
hang on someone please tell me this
the term 'derp' isn't a meme or phrase derived from the new MLP cartoon/canon is it?
No.
some blonde pony with grey body and cockeyed vision
no

its like saying duuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Derp is pretty old, Derpy is one of the unofficial characters that usually appears wall-eyed.

12I don't think it was 80's

4I remember a show about a talking cow
12I think it was more 90's I think...
The magic roundabout?
12Nope
5May told me to get over here so I did. xD;
That was aimed at Hooh54.
4And a show about talking hands
oh wait was the book a magic book and had a face?

14:>
12YES
5:3
14OMG NICK
14RAINBOW BRIGHT

MLP is pretty much the only good thing that's come out of TV in the last 5 years.
12Yeah! I loved that <3
/me has a thing for Starlight <3
o_o
5Oh, um, can I PM you, May?

Aww don't worry, maybe you'll understand when you're older. :)
i doubt it
i'm 17
XD
Average age range is 18-34.
i dont even watch tv anymore
*Transformers Prime is the only good thing that's come out of TV the last five years* <---corrected
/me runs!
Nick is correct.
LOL I know someone who watches that.
4I'm bored
/me hides
I had them watch ponies, they liked it.
actually no he isnt
Transformers Armada is the one im on about
12I used to watch Cats Eyes and Dappledown farm as a kid <3
5I watch broadcast Dramas... BUT THEY GET FREAKING CANCELED. :C
02._.
meh i dun like dramas
02Have I said that I hate my internet connection?
Forever alone guy can see ponies getting closer every day.
Ray's winternetz are trollin'
(just so you know I'm only joking, my manhood can't bear seeing boys liking MLP Dx it KILLS ME!)
IT DOES
4Ponies are awesome
they arent.
IT DRIVES ME TO DRINK (water)
/me runs
02Who here has firepower
Nick: Clearly you aren't very manly.
02(aka: guns)
Only manly men watch ponies. :)
4I'm thirsty
4^
.-.
Manliest show on TV.
4._.
Im soo weak! *cries*
Nup
You arent
4NEIGH
5I'm certainly not manly but I don't like MLP. :|
Ponies are for girls.
4^ say that to the bronies
The show isn't even made just for 5 year old girls.
god i hate that word, bronies
Faust made it with the idea of it being a family show that anyone could enjoy.
4I hate the rest of her shows, Powerpuffs.....
MLP is as stupid as minecraft
which is very stupid
02LOL, Silver. Test of courage: Say "Ponies are for girls" in /b/
02:D
MLP is about as stupid as you liking pokemon. :P
Ponies are for girls!
/me runs
4FINALLY someone who thinks Minecraft is stupid
Pokemon is for 6 year olds!
Problem?
5In defense, some of the plot lines and stories in Pokémon have been rather ridiculous.
5Maybe even "stupid", to use the term. (;
^
12To each their own
4I like the fact that I'm the only one with colored text, but then May and Roleplay posted
My point is that I don't berate you guys for liking pokemon, so why have you got to do the same to me?
5^ SARCASM GUYS
4THEN LATI
5(inb4)
14well, it seems odd to me
Hai guys :D
1 hm?
XD
It's just a bit hypocritical.
14that a person that doesn't like Pokemon is on a Pokemon site
5Hey~
14to me it's ironic
MAY
12If I spelt lati backwards but then added a y at the end it would be italy
liek, hai
May|Writing: I didn't say that, I was making a point. >___________________>
14hai :>
hm
/me glomps a May
5May, I think ...whoever said that originally was being Sarcastic. xD
4Italati
13:3
14sarcasm is hard to read unless it's obvious
14just saying
4I want to ride a Latias
The point I was making was obvious.
14this is text on a screen
14well I wans't following
so how's everyone?
14I'm like, at 5 places at once
4I just ate a cookie, no lie
O.o
/me gives Hooh54 another one!
4Delicious
if I was president, I would ban all males from EVER liking MLP :D and when they do I'd go "This is illegal you know!"
Nick, then they'd overthrow you in 10 minutes.
And heya Nick :)
02Jeeerrryyyy
02~
4@Nick You would probably get trampled by the herd
to that I would say
RAY
02Where's tom? *Shot*
RAAAAAAAY
"This is illegal you know!"
I need a Ray
!ray
/me does a barrel roll and avoids ownership, nice try!
5Why can't we just live and let live? Some people love MLP. Some people don't.
D: darn
/me huggles a Ray
Besides Nick, what's your problem with other people liking something? I'm not asking you to like it, just not attack me because I do. >__>
Lati: orly? o.o
/me hugs bacl
02back*
12Yes <3
how? o.o
14hahah yeah
4Word association
14uhm
14anyway, backing out
4Cats
12XD
/me gives Lati a Latios and gets SHOT
12they stalk your windows
12=O
4Neigh neigh neigh
I give up.
yay
a neighing Ho-Oh? thats something new XD
Love and tolerance for all who dislike MLP.
4It already sounds like a donkey
4LISTEN TO THE IN GAME CRY
02I'm neutral at MLP
5Lol game cries. Some of them are epic, some are epic fail.
whats MLP?
/me confused
13I like the show, and dislike the fanbase
13:B
MLP should be MLM, My Little Monkey
Don't ask.
/me is confused*
uh okay.
02So I just say. Cool Sotry Bro, and move on 8D
XD
12I've not even seen it so I'm good either way
4My little pony is mlp
I just don't get how something that's been around for so long suddenly re-exploded in popularity again
5MLP = My Little Pony. It's a TV series.
okay so...has anyone seen Higurashi?
Super Mario Bros. live action film must have been written by monkeys.
12YES
13I have
oh..wait..isn't that a kids show?
The script was SO bad.
ME TOO
I mean ok Transformers did it but that had a blockbuster hollywood movie franchise behind
12One of my favourite animes <3
Lati: same here :3
Rika ftw
14AKDHLKAL WHYYYYY NOW I'M GOING TO GET CRAZY ON TOUHOU MUSIC D:
also bang on with the mario bros movie quote
i'm still on season 1 though.
5Michael Bay Transformers is the dirge of films. D|
12Rika's awesome! Mion's my favourite character though =)
13Rena for me~
4The only thing good about Higurushi is one of the theme songs. *hides*
Rena=chopper
Bowser tries to rape Daisy, his wife stabs Yoshi, and he pretty much has a harem of kidnapped women? HOW IS THIS A CHILDREN'S FILM?!? HOW?!
o.o
lol
12she's gonna take you home
4._.
12watch out
yeah
13xD
why does hollywood try its upmost best to remain as far away from the video game source material as possible?
she's gonna go crazy over you and then try to take you home XD
God only knows Nick.
5Because video games often make for bad films.
Resident evil one movie, was ok, coulda been considered a seperate story within the RE universe
5Kind of like books. Only worse.
14Who knows how to link Youtube videos to the TST profiles?
14Because I forgot the coding to that
4I just watched a movie about BURDS
5What movie?
Lati: did you complete season 1-3?
RE2 movie: completely fails in trying to combine the plots of the movie and RE3 video game and completely mucks it up that it satisfies no one
4http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYh40mcj8dc
awesome :D
4oH AND i WATCHED rIO
4*Oh, and I watched Rio
14bah forget it, I'll go look for a topic
Higurashi is one of the few animes that can really get you tensed up at certain parts
12Hehe tell me about it <3
it doesn't satisfy the movie crowd cos they don't know whats going on, and it doesn't satisfy the fans of the video game because it completely differe to the source material and mucks up the game's plot
and the soundtrack=creepy
13May, go on the youtube video, then share -> embed -> check "use old embed code" -> copypaste the code into your media section :3
13I can't remember how to make it autoplay though
same with super mario bros only they tried their upmost best to remain as far away from the source material
/me also gives Lati a Mion at the same time*
12I love the main theme song <3
Apparently they didn't have much source material to work with at the time the Super Mario Bros. film was made though.
12=D
;D yay
4Neigh
/me prods a neighing Hooh54
02:3c
14Angel, I meant how to code it in to the Media section
14I'm not sure what the CODING is
14I know how to do that, just not the coding lol
I'd take italian plumber rescuign a princess from a dragon while jumping on living mushrooms over a plot about the dinosaurs living in a seperate dimension due to the asteriod, where they evolved into creatures that looked exactly like humans anyway, and Mairo is played by a prolific British actor who specialises in violent mob movies
4NEIGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
14I have horses, Hooh54. And I'm sure they'd love to meet you. :>
/me pets Ray
13don't you just copypaste it into the media section? o_o
14only problem is we have stallions that are a little crazy right now
I've got to say though, the film was so bad it was hillarious.
4My RL friend has horses
14no, it needs coding, Angel
I have horsies too
14like [img] and stuff
The goombas were creepy as hell.
lol yeah
02May, No they don't
14or what breed I should say
if we had Cookie and crumb it would be a complete set
And the bobomb at the end. XD
Oreo Cookie Crumb
12 foot tall soviet cossacks with a tiny head
13strange, I just copypasted the embed code into my media section and it worked
Yeah, hahaha.
Lati: its funny how Keiichi is the one that gets killed directly/indirectly in every single arc that I've watched
02you literally just copy and paste the embed code.
02and that's it.
actually soviet cossacks is so totally wrong historically o.o
4wat
14hmm, I'll check it then and see if I can do it
cossacks actually fought the soviets xD
13just make sure to use the old embed code o3o
14oh I see
14I just clicked the wrong one lol
/me fails

7If we're talking about flying types, well, TST. :P
13:3c
7Really, AE? :3
7Acrobatics + Flying Gem = WIN.
04^
4You can not grasp the awesomeness of Archen!
04Defeatist?
13Any flying-type could do that :B
4^ Suckish ability
7Ability that cuts Archeops's attack stats to half at half HP.
7And AE, no, not really.
04wait wow
6flying gem?
04why does that happen
04:c
12power swap
6what's that
7How many Flying types have 140 power?
04um
04a gem
7 140 attack, that is.
04that boost flying
7Base.
04:P
7</details>
6but doesn't acrobatics lower its strength when the pokemon is holding something
7It's consumed before the attack.
04^
7So the attack is still doubled.
6oh the gem is a consumable item
7Yep.
04yep
7 165 attack + STAB.
4Just EV it in attack + flying gem + acrobatics = awesome
6god that attack would be awesome then xD
04Edable Chaos emeralds
7(And 140 attack.)
/me runs
04*Emeralds |3
4I'm actually thinking about using Archeops on my team
/me 7used one. o3o
7I battled with it in AnimeNEXT.
7OHKOing Hydreigon is an impressive feat.
7(For me, at least.)
13I've hardly touched White since I finally got Reshiram on the game |D
13Nowadays I've just been using it for game sync and stuff
/me 7has a good ~300 hours?
4Hydreigon is good, but its speed is horrid
7Choice Scarf, a possibility.
12UGH the loading screen
13I'll probably start playing it again once I finally get my espeon from the GL
12I still can't even get into dream world LOL
04nuu
04later Roara
4Yay, I spent a week trying to get GL Espeon
7On the DS or on the website, Lati?
7I don't touch Game Sync much now. X.x
12The website, I click dream world and it says 0% and looks as if its loading and never does
7I got my Drought Vulpix, soo... :P
12just sticks to 0% >_<
7Ah, Lati, then I think you have to update your Flash player.
12Ah that makes sense! =P
04Quan
7Mmmhmm?
04how'd you get a Drought Volpix?
7 10000+ points, Pleasant Forest.
I have the Hitmonlee pic up, finally.
04...oh
13I still only have 2000-something points |D
7Getting 500 every day allows you it in 20 days.
4I have like, 50
7Not too bad. XD
Pixs.
4I don't go on the dream world much XD
I'll just sext it to you.
7 50 is pretty dang low. O_o
ttly
7Seeing as (before the update), you get 50 for sending a dream pokemon to your game.
13ever since I got one Dream Pal, people seem to visit my house every day and such now o-o
13makes me feel loved |D

Well struggle less and let it drop ;P
7Nah, you fish.
4Yeah, but my post went up one in fourm games
7Posts don't count there.

The Fan Handle Rule: If a board is themed after a series, users who sign up with a screen name pertaining to the series (Kefka2938) will do one of three things:
Lose interest in the forum and vanish very quickly,
Change their name when they become a respected member of the community,
Consistently act like an idiot and be liked by nobody.
"OMGSPYRO4LYFE20000841"
7Ah, well. Rule #97 strikes, I guess.
And such.
No surpise there.

/me tilts his head
4Nuuuu Sky
7Enjoy, RP4L. *late*
5Haha, so many of those apply to the forum I'm most active on, http://therushforum.com .
5Especially 107 and 108.
This list is amazingly relevant.
4I'm on 4 fourms at once
Yeah.
/me hugs Kitten
/me climbs onto LL's back

5It's funny, I feel closer to the average age of most of us on TST, but over at TRF I'm considered a really young person. D:
lol
lol
lol
02lol
I feel young here .-.
04back
04hm
4Lol
And your point is?
;p
04Guys, interesting theory
Hmm?
04Anyone think that Nintendo'll add 3D support to the Wii U controller?
4The theory of lol
People tend to assume that I'm older than I am when they first talk to me.
5There are maybe seven to ten active users my age, and no more than five younger than me. /shrug
02.-.
Ohey there
4._.
5I remember when I first started going into IRC Chat here in 2007 Arti and a few other people figured I was at least a few years older than I actually was. xD
xD
7Hmm. I'd say the same for me. Except not first into IRC.
5The general reaction was something like "You're /fourteen?!/"
Some people think I'm older than my actual age .-.
Ah xD
5But now I'm going into college and I feel OLD.
You people with your decades-earlier-than-midlife-crises.
4I bet people think I'm older then I actually am
Lol youre not old. 70-80 is old
5But IRL I look really young and I'm short so they don't believe me when I tell them I'm going to be a freshman in college.. Well, sometimes. It depends. If they start talking to me they assume I'm already in college. It's really weird.
04Ho-oh
04I doubt that
/me runs
03who the heck is Hooh54
12[19:25] <Hooh54> I bet people think I'm older then I actually am <-- Around 15 or 16?
7Please say that nicer, DRF. :<
12lol drf, a person from the forums
You probably don't look like you're going to to college, but once you start talking it makes sense xD
4The world will never know
12who the heck is drf
o.o
