6I'm broke.
6It's all I can afford, really.
6Otherwise I probably would eat worse.
6I used to just eat tons of McDonalds for no reason other than I was passing the place.
There are dumplings here
Ew, even I won't eat THAT crap, and I've eaten a rubber hamburger on a bet.
6Can't come over.

6I'm aware. >>;
6...
6You are not the only one.
No
6You're really not.
But it's never going to happen
6EVERYPONY we know does.
XD no I saw
All of the ponies
6And no, never going to happen.
ALL OF THEM
/me thinks he hears a call of "Ferris wheel".
o.o
never noticed that before
8I
6I am the ferris wheel.
6Remember?
kind of creepy
well no, not really
Talking of hot dumplings and bumfuckery probably doesn't help? XD
The ferris wheel on a ferris wheel.
>.<
all clowns are creepy, even pony ones
6We tend to word things worse, Rurik.
WE NEED TO DEEPER
jk
only some clowns
And that just made it worse. XD
I don't know if I'm comfortable with that
6Chat just got 20% gayer.
4>shipping SprinklesxSkaian
4wut
4Lol errybody gay up in 'ere
Seriously, I never shipped before ponies.
My first shipping was digimon XD
To be honest I'm not actually keen on fanfiction, shipping, etc.
6I still don't ship. But that's likely because my fave character is Apple Bloom.
That doesn't seem to stop the Spikebloom shippers.
4SkaianBrony: Digimon, you say?
i guess the movie night is over
6SpikeBloom is not a shipping.
Yes. Digi. Mon.
6It is a mock shipping, if anything.
D digimon
4Which season?
4*nods*
I actually liked season 4. (Flame shield activated.)
Anyone?
No opinion on 2, and...I do believe there was no Fourth Season
Oh, quite a few "someones."
4There was a fourth season
4I loved season 2
Neat.
4It was my favorite season
6I am currently RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGEing that even though I have the most points in the GETters list, I still have to battle KoG for 1st, whereas any other place can be taken without battle.
(Refuses to acknowledge season 4)
Are these official?
4I wish I couldn't acknowledge Season 3, but that's just me
6WHY WOULD YOU POST THOSE KNOWING I HAVE NO MONEY TO BUY THEM WITH?
4Was there ANY character development in Season 4?
6>>;
TROLOLOLOLOLOL
There weren't any companion digimon. I was disappoint
Official pony shirts.
DO WANT
4I watched Digimon for the plot
6>plot
were do u get those t shirts!!?
XD awesome man
Rainbow Dash shirts. :o
I watched for the monsters
whaaat
o__o
oh yeah
I need that Spike one
why does the Spike one say "Epic cute"
6LUCKY STAR
6XD
I like a few of those, mostly ones without the dumb writing
I like it too
6Nope.
not sure about the caption though
Or do you mean the "plot."
the rarity DEAL WITH IT and born this way is awesome though
6Likely the "plot"
Yes. That. ><
6As that's one of the mane reasons to watch it.
I saw Rarity DEAL WITH IT wearing sunglasses and I died.
That was too good.
Wink wink, nudge nudge, say no more, say no more.
6I... can't stop making pony puns.
4Sprinkles!
Also Rarity with implied "BITCH, I am flawless". XD
6My head is full of pony.
6What?
6I never said I did.
hate to break it to you dari, but I bet these are only in women's/girl's
They're far to skinny to clop to anyway.
4"Likely the 'plot'"
Twas I that trolled that
They're making them in men's sizes sometime I think.
Never actually seen it, though I don't find myself caring too much
"Adorbs"
I <3 Rainbow Dash shirt is best shirt.
xD
I think the "simply awesome" one is the best
0_0
I just looked at the first link
6Oo Rurik
Rarity "Deal with it" is definitely the best
XD
hahaha
that one is pretty good
I'd get both the simply awesome one and I <3 Rainbow Dash one.

06what
scripts that store lists are fun
06I didn't expect it to work LOL
Iskierka, it has a lot of bugs
and exploits
06yeah
I already nulled the $crlf one
LOL
I have one that stores quotes which could probably be converted to a todo list, if it still works ...
there's a $decode one as well
nah, this script works perfectly fine
it just has exploits
and there's one more thing I need to fix

I doubt you'd get them anyway, as you're always bad :p

02Lol
Yush, bad girl! :P
13Awards are silly, but that's just my opinion :3

I'm still deciding on everything
Heya JL :3
heya!
hi j
quizzes like the pokescram one, I mean
hi Nick
and during those 30 seconds it'll print out clues at a few intervals
that works too
hint scripts are usually unneeded and annoying
I prefer that system but it's tedious to script
kk..
come on, Cone
oh nice
10k
that's cool
just going to do one more and then I'm done
Iskierka
/me hides
10I know
oh blah
$crlf
though, it's stopped now ...
uh
it's not that
?
I see
You know
hrm, can $crlf be removed just with $strip or similar?
I learned one thing
03yi-
not sure, haven't tried
In case someone replaces it with vanishing ink
how have you solved it?
I just block crlf
because ($crlf isin $1-) doesn't work
I think you should block anything with $something
that might on occasion bring up problems but that could work fine
yeah
or just get it to use $chr
that way we can also see people trying to exploit it
but that's dodgy
yeah that'd be good
wow
yeah, whenever she reappears
she probably won't for quite some time as she has work
I suggest you PM it to her on the forums
Oh. D:
That's nasty
/me explodes
I just posted
Hmmm, delay
or it should
because mIRC parses everything
Just kill the script
I can't
it's not that necessary
It's Articuno's
...why?
!tststop
She's here
lmfao timing
06lol
06tim- yeah
Peas!
!tststop
or something?
that should have stopped it, yes
LOL EXPLOIT!
well
I'm not at home by the way
the script parses mIRC identifiers like $crlf in the topic's name
yeah
ovO
and it would give nick +ao
....LOOOOOOOOOOOOL
yeah
XD
06lol
ARTI hai!
;D
lmao

Someone made a topic with a word in it that bans the user
I don't think I was on/I don't remember that

Aww ok
I'm at Xai's family's house
Well one of them ;>
We're here till tomorrow
I assume you can't update the script from there? :p
nice
I think i can
Hmm ok well I can look into both of those things I think
I just need to remote onto the server at home..
alright, I can upload an updated version of the forum script once I have one
K ^v^
uh, I can PM/notice you a one-line version of the script? XD
Hi~
a one-line version of the forum script would be damn impressive.
lmao Iskierka, was talking about the chatstats one
Wait which script?
LOL
roooooooofl
Yes I thought it might be that
XD

early reviews I saw last night showed it was bombing critically
3Yeah
ookay that's a should-be-working forum script uploaded
3Besides, it's been in process for 10 years, but it's not even decent
do you have it Dd?
3Yeah.
it's DNF, to get good reviews at this point it would've had to cure cancer or sth
3(Well actually my cousin ordered it 10 years ago, and we got some sort of ticket stub)
06They did say they would
06more like nuke dukem fornever
3Yup
gamestop said they'd fulfil all reservation
still...the massive reduced price must say somethign :\
3Yeah
14 years of waiting
for a piece of *****
3Yup. Sucks, doesn't it?
you have an extra *
/me poofs
3Mmm-hmm
3Prolly
solution: don't look at those games, look to the ones which are bothering to be different
ex. we've already had P2 this year
06the thing with DNF I think
06it tried to be "like" old-styled shooters
06And LOL WWE GAMES
06Those have changed less than CoD ffs xD
are those levels actually as long though?
yeah but other devs are diving on board with it now; Mortal Kombat (who makes that nowadays?), the people that made Homefront..
I have no idea, not really paid attention to it
hm
i never played XBOX or Kinect
but i still don't like it
Kinect is decent, but not best
Too many silly shooters :P
I have never touched a 360 or PS3, never plan to either
06KINECTKINECTKINECT
^
in other words, Kinect sucks
would work best with those fixed and having something actually solid, rather than just dancing with air
Maybe
That would explain a lot
it's Kinect.....it DOES hate tall people....
Cool, now I have another reason to not even think about it
06Kinect - not promoting diversity
/me dies
no
just no
/me shot
....
they hate me
Can't get yourself into the picture right?
....
;o
take a wild guess
:P
hehe
yep
always the drivers....
:o
Lol, ,y brother jyst gace mw a "cat in the gat" Har madr out if duxt taoe
i *CAN* run old games
......
Was that English?
O_o
i don't know
Gibberish O>o
there's no real reason why 64-bit shouldn't accept 32-bit drivers, I say you're doing it wrong.
....
I say 64bit is doing it wrong, and 32 is still doing it right
;p
wich case? the english or my drivers?
I mean, you lose 16bit compatibility ;,;
16bit is waaaay out of date
64bit's doing it right but CBA to reinstall all my crap.
and see if you're saying that once the date counter runs out
16bit is waaay- oh, still works
xD
I mean, too bad if it's 16bit, I need to get myself some old 16bit apps/games :P
^
use emulation
those were always good
No thanks
commodor emulators SUCK, believe me
i'm not doing it wrong
More like the coder is doing it wrong
but again, see how you like 32-bit on the 19th of january 2038
....
Hrm, I'll still like it
Because 8bit is best bit.
....
my school thinks that teaching newbs about Win98 helps.....
Of course it helps, history is useful
morons......
EW WIN98

woah

Okay, I never reach full
Pssh
Malwarebytes is using the most RAM at 100MB LOL
It's called open-open source software ;P
06well it doesn't bother me, I still have enough memory~~
See, the 'open' referrs to how the RAM it uses is empty ;D
06haha
06"Just in case I need this RAM I'll hold onto it, kk?"
Yup, which is why open source isn't that great at times :P
Speaking of oldness, I'ma install MYST on my laptop
Yes
Then yeah, I've played that before.
Very...impossible :P
I want to play RealMyst, but I don't have it

06hhhhhhhh I hate bees
10Especially the kind that never leave you alone when you swat at them
NOT THE BEES!
ARRGGGHGHGH BBLLELE
How'd it get burned? HOW'D IT GET BURNED?!
I've never been stung by a bee or a wasp, and that's probably because I don't freak out around them and try to kill them. >___>
Same here XD
10I *hate* any insects getting near me
10Yes, I run away from them
10I'm too afraid to kill them :P
Still you shouldn't hit bees or wasps.
06I do not hit them, I move away and let them do whatever they do. Usually they go away after a minute or two (lucky me)
Night
Cya.
12Wasps just annoy me a bit

hey lightumbreon and Angel Espeon and everyone
10Speaking of that, I was disappointed in Lugia's HGSS theme
13Ho-oh's > Lugia's
13in my opinion
10Yus
;.;
02yeah
why do ho-oh's hate LightLgia?
*LightLugia
10Lugia's was an example of trying too hard, probably
10I agree with RSE's Kyogre/Groudon/Rayquaza battle music

10I prefer DPPt, Cynthia's
02that theme also <3333333333333
13Not a battle theme, but I loved Canalave City's theme at night
10Alder's (BW) was stupid
12I loved Pokémon Red/Blue's Lavender town theme music =w=
10Ecruteak City for me @ Espy
02Golden Rod City for me~
13Goldenrod City in GSC <3
and PokeRemixStudio's remix of it was AWESOME
<33333333
13The HGSS version isn't the same :<
02^ :<
10None of HGSS is, unfortunately
12I was hoping that we could have had Pokédolls in our rooms again in HG/SS like in GSC u.u
13I actually quite like a lot of HGSS's soundtrack
13I like how they made Ecruteak and Cianwood sound different to match the town even though they have the same base tune
02bbl, haircut
02Bye~

03if we could figure that out
o_O
03it's a plain text dictionary
03that would be the easiest thing to use, no?
I don't think it has a search function.
03that's the problem
oh nice
03I mean, control-f would work, but does irssi have that ability?
03and it would ahve to take the starting kletter and use that one
03so eh
have you guys ever heard cats talk to eachother?
03but
03we could generate our own dictionary LOL
03as in
03take all 26 letters
03and then be like @fine?
03*find
yeah we could
03or something
03then we could forge and/or add custom definitions :D
03like we'd put one for pony as "A stupid fad"
/me hids
03*hides
lmao
I am on 197 channels, across 23 networks. I have 13 olines, 120 ops, 10 halfops and 9 voices. I have non-abusive power over 1130 people.

03OPTED v0.03 by Archive
03OPTED v0.03can also be downloaded as a large stuffit/binhex encoded archive. (7.1MB/ 19.1M unpacked)
03there
03they already have one
yeah
03they said it was made on a Mac
it's a binhex
03wtf is a binhex
er
it's a .hqx
it's a mac file
03EW MACS
and uh
Binary to Hexadecimal text file created for Mac computers; contains data that has been compressed and encoded from an 8-bit binary format into a 7-bit text format; can be useful for transferring binary images, documents, and multimedia as text in email attachments.
03why the frick would they dot hat
03that seems dumb LOL
you can try unzip it
I'd prefer just to do it via the site
give me 5 minutes
IF my connection stops lagging
crap
03o.o
03"Let's not forget good old /usr/dict/words. Or /usr/share/dict/words, depending. "
lmao
03what is that?
oh
!define gryphon
-!- No results found
it's a list of all words
That is still fail
03oh
03but it doesn't ahve the definitions?
no defs though
03eXAKR, WE AREN'T DONE WITH IT YET
03oh.
A
A's
AOL
AOL's
Aachen
03so using that one database it is?
yeah
03LOL AOL
I thought you could have fixed it while I was away for a bit
but the problem is
with that plaintext dictionary
the file is huge
03yaeh
03l;ike 20MB
Hmmm
20MB is not that large
yeah
I can't even select all just the A page
It takes ~5 seconds to read a 2MB file on mIRC.
That's not good
and not sure if irssi is faster or slower
2MB is over a million lines of text.
pretty much
well
it's not a million
It is, I checked my log. :P
!scramble
!hint3
The first four letters of the current word are "spla"
!guess splash
normal word wow.
12nothing happened!
but that reads from a 2mb or 6mb word list
I forgot
The Scramble script?
Oh never mind.
My log isn't 2MB it's 58.
lmfao
Oh, 62MB actually.
O_o
That's a lot of text.
03gooooooooooooooooooooooooood
You guys talk too much.
03why is there no plaintext dictionary
03that's searchable
03for irssi?
03I doubt it
Probably.
You know guys
You should ask yourselves
Is this necessary?
03is trying to own everyone on this channel?
03Is even being here necessary?
03I think the answers are the same for all of those.
...
lmao
You're right DRF. I'll go and kill myself now.
I think I meant that as
Do we need a define script?
03I meant on the channel
03Yes we do]
...
and drf, we could put the thing onto a plaintext document
upload it to irssi's directory
03irssi has its own dictionary?
LOL FAIL
directroy
03oh
directory*
03right
lmao
03that's basically exactly waht I said, isn't it>?
well
03to just make a .txt file?
make it more plaintext
than the current one
03uh
03LOL
Wait
the one they have still has some codes
Why not break the dictionary files into smaller chunks
but the thing is
I can't even highlight one page
And then have the script go through them one by one
03ROFL YOU'RE RIGHT
03wait
03nope
Hmmm.
03I finally got it
derp
damnit drf
>:(
03...
03it didn't copy though
03clipboard overload or sth
wat
03wait
lmfao
03no
03I got it
03Azure (n.) The clear blue color of the sky; also, a pigment or dye of this color.
03Azure (n.) The blue vault above; the unclouded sky.
03Azure (v. t.) To color blue.

Oo
03there aren't really codes
03in that
03946kb
03for the a's
03though
03there are a lot of duplicates
03and some are way too long
03for one line
oh okay
that's fine then
Well you guys have fun with this
well
the HTML source
03It would be nice if we could like
03get rid of duplicates
I'm going to do my own things
03just keep the first of each word, you know?
Well you could write a script to do it. :P
craaaaaaaaaaaapy
get rid of duplicates?L
-L
03like
03the same word twice
03or like those 20 Azure's

and the other is an adjective
03yes yes I know

it was something about you and me
being somewhere
06doesn't sound weird
and then Xeli appears and throws us into a cage and locks us up
06Oh, okay
and then some other random people from TST and HoR appear
and then Xeli is like, a reincarnation of the Hensh
04o-o
04wat
04the movie is at 12pm
and cool, that's fine too
and then like, Xeli comes up to us and is like "you can join me or die"
04...what is with you and weird-ass dreams?
or something like that
and idk
and then we float back down and we're all like lalalalalala
and then we fly away or something
and then nuke the castle
and Xeli dies.
I was like "wat"
and then I woke up and fell asleep again.
sense = none

/me is chewed on

;o
unless
nuuu
12Chat stats is back on the site now
XD
Nice
peas*
/me has chocolate :3
And mail you a list of the top 20 or something
12Yeh a list would be great!
I'm in the top
fghjsiukfhrsoeuhyfroiefk
place 3 for me? no...nonono...why would i need a place that high?
I dunno, I've been less active than normal :P
but then again, I was high about an hour ago
12I want to average this out a bit
HOW?!
HOW! I SAY?!
she always is.....
/me runs
12There hasnt been enough activity to count it from now
XD
12Hmm
/me huggles lightlugia
mine
mine
and then I'll mail it to you
12Because that's when it ticks over
yeah that'd be easy
because I can do that manually
I wounder why?
12Oh right, I was about to say
12But you'd need to remind yourself
I'll remind him,
Not hard ;p
12him ovO
him? lol
OMG ITS A POP TART PONY!
Him?
4HIM?
Not him c.c
Him from power puff girls?
Kill him, erase!
/me hides
lmfao
its him
him's the one
finish him
IU agree
bbl
12well, it needs to be timed right..
but well
12So right before the stats tick over otherwise they'll reset XD
>timezones
I guess I could write a date related script
12The best thing is you're ahead of me XD
yep xD
W
-ScriptBot- TIME Sun Jun 12 23:42:06 2011
lmfao
Well
Nice time :P
how does it reset?
with a baseball bat
when you hit it of course :P
W
12Hmm
there its Arty CHan
12It doesn't reset actually, I just thought about it
12It's not like a yearly thing
Do you have to erase the data manually?
Or do you run a program?
12Data doesn't get erased
heh
you could also do stats for the cbox
/me hides
12lolno way
Oh the c-box
cbox?
That place, urgh :P
12Shoutbox
"Most common topic on the cbox"
"Ponies"
HURR DURR PONY CANCER.
etc.
I mean
hi
Pony Fireworks
lmfao
Yup, needs some chemo
/me hides
/me 7lurks too much. >>
Pony cars
there
Yep
12Thanks
I'll probably have to send the list manually though
12That's fine
I was thinking to give you the list
at the end of each month
because every 24 hours it should check the stats
but woun;d't it have to be for that month though
?
12Yeh thats fine
and then make a list
12I can't see the top 20 changing much in a month
and if nicks already exist, then it'll just add the nicks that aren't already in there
but now its you
seeing as Cone would probably be more stable
12I'll run it on Cone then ;>
there?
xD
There it is
lmfao
Oh nice
12Who runs it?
I do
12Oh is it an mIRC client?
12Like cone?
It's run on a VM on one of my servers
yep
`;o
Nice
12cool :>
it's mIRC 6.21
ew
126.2 for the win ^
12*^^
well
7.1 FTW
/me hides
for some reason
it keeps pinging
NS|VNC has no problems
I think it's the client as they're on the same computer/connection
oh well, I'll figure it out one day
okay thats just cute
iir 6.21 has problems
.
iirc*
Tons of problems I suppose :P
7.x sucks
iIRC
drf would hate that
You just can't handle the new-ness of it
iirc = if I recall correctly
:<
Xcrap?
/me le gasps
I mean, Xchat
LOL
x-chat actually isn't that bad
mIRC sucks tbqh
no it doesn't
Well the colours are terrible for one, and changing settings isn't as fun :P
lags like crap, but at least the scripting integration with IRC is good
I wouldn't be able to use the
the /me
script
Now if you want fun and hard, try Telnet :D
x-chat's scripting system is crap
LOL
I tried it once on another server
I did that
Never let me in :P
Telnet IS Dial-Up era related
:P
oh
Ohaji
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
hm
Before you PING
!ping
nah no need
!ping
but this is terrible though
Whynot XD
I have to do privmsg #Silverwings :message everytime
Yeah, typing privms
Yeah XD
it's called raw IRC
wow
Needs some cleaning, go clients
It's pure IRC pretty much, IRC in its rawest form
ewwwwwwwwwwwww
cook it
now
Messy :P
If I talk like this*
I can't see the difference
crap
hm?
I mena hi
you need to do
I can never seem to get it right x.x
er
user*
not nick
and then nick yournickhere
and then you're ready to go
wat
telnet island.lugia.us 6667
wait for the :AUTH
and then

Lies
look on the chatstats page
02^^
02Morning~
10HML :3
06Sky :3
10Espeon~
hey Espeon
/me sits on someone's head
/me is sat upon
10Hi Espy
13ohai Sky :3
02Hi Angel~
13:3
13I slept too long again D:
10Use an alarm clock
13But I don't like using alarms unless I need to be awake for a certain time
13I feel sleepier than usual if I don't wake up naturally xD
10Well, it might help "train" you to wake up at a certain time
10Sometimes I find myself waking up that early on weekends, and in the summer too x.x
13Up until recently I've been doing pretty well at waking up between 10:30am and 11am, but for some reason I've been getting too much sleep these past couple nights >>
13I can't remember |D 3am or something
06:3
10Strange
10You think 8 hours is too much? o.o
/me yawns
10ohai NS
13I used to think 8 hours was not enough for me, LOL
06I can function somewhat decently on like 5 hours, but I tend to sleep as long as possible sooo
10Lolsuperstitions
10I feel lazy/groggy if I get more than 8 hours or less than 6
Oh hush :p
I do 5-7 hrs normally
But more than that...I feel terrible XD
13I tend to get about 6-7 hours on nights where I have college the next day, which usually isn't enough for me |D
139-10 hours is when I normally feel the most awake, but more than that tends to make me feel all sluggish :<
I need 8 to 9
/me hides
And sometimes even that is not enough
>>
06aaaand foodtiemz
13I've never pulled an all-nighter before
10Successfully only pulled two all-nighters, and hopefully never again
13probably because I know I'll be asleep for the whole day afterwards |D
10The first one I wasn't prepared for, while the second one was
why am I not asleep
oh wait
that's why
10Who?
Not me
/me hides
Anyway
it's xat crap
yes.
I don't understand why some people can be energised with 6 hours of sleep, while I feel like crap sometimes even after nine
it's Dakurai's
It sucks big-time for me
10Drama and n00bs pretty much sums up xat chatrooms
xat?
10http://xat.com/
02eXAKR, I usually sleep 6 hours .-.
10I used to go on my friend's xat chatrooms, that's why I know of them
<Skylands> Drama and n00bs pretty much sums up xat chatrooms
this
10From #TF? Yeah
yeah
10He's annoying
heh, he's sort of matured
/me mauled
lmao
Hmmm
he's just nooby
How?
02I don't know xD
I WISH I could do 6 hours of sleep
well
I function on 4-5 hours per day
lol
02lmfao.
and 8-10 on saturday night
02^
Maybe
I've gotten used to it :p
Jealous.
10Wouldn't it be nice if we didn't rely on sleep at all? :P
But then we could all die due to lack of sleep
Heh
<3
anyway
I really should sleep
Ew
10o.o
Go go go
Don't kill yourself ;p
LOL
I'd rather be caught watching nothing at all
10In that case, use !silence
!silence
/me says "BREAK THE SILENCE!!!!!!!"

02The Opening
12Well, we can't easily..
7Either as those adoptables or as those awards.
02I loved it.

10Ah

10Lol, Shugo Chara
Sugar Chug?
13Shugo Chara was good until the 3rd season came out :<
10I thought Madoka looked more like Ichigo from TMM
i'm lost on this, ain't i?
10Especially their magical girl outfits
13after that I only watched the episodes with Ikuto in them LOL
/me watched SC up until episode 30
Star Craft?
10Dunno why I quit
10Shugo Chara, LU
13I watched it up until around the 3rd episode of season 3
Same
13and no, it's not about rotten flesh-eating zombies
10Did they ruin the manga of SC too?
wow Sky I like it
10Damos, whut?
10Oh, I used to buy the SC manga, before Borders closed around here. I have up to volume 5
13well, it's either that or they simply don't bother with it
12Gonna turn the forum on aghain in a min
13it tends to go either way |D
10None of my IRL friends really like anime :<
13Same really, and the few that do like anime aren't really into watching it as much anymore
13then again, I've only recently gotten back into watching anime myself |D
10Same, thanks to PMMM
10and partly you XD
10The last thing I watched before PM was OHHC, which was in 2008-ish

03what pisses me off is that poeple are changing their forum names, avatars, signatures, etc with ponies
Posting it everywhere where it's not relevant sure, that's just stupid and annoying.

Please don't start.

06well, some people get stuck there
13I like the show, but I've grown to really dislike the fanbase
13That's all I'll say
06But I won't even start that rant LOL
13When I get obsessed with something, the most I'll probably do is maybe change my avatar for a bit or something
13but that's all
13anyway
12LOL obsessions
13that hoovering session took more effort than it should've done :<

12In contrast to my friends rooms, I'm suprised I don't have much of a messy room
12XD
13I don't know how people can stand living in a messy environment ;w;
12^
12I have a messy cupboard but lets not go into that LOL
I prefer it messy to honest.
Makes it more interesting when I want to find something.

13My wardrobe isn't as tidy as I'd like it to be, but I've never bothered to organise it properly because I still know where everything is

02LOL norton.
02AVG > Norton.
12Also, that "Malicious Web Site" is dA |D
02Almost Everyting > AVG
Avast! is good too.
You're probably safer without Norton.
12Na, I'm too safe with Nortion
>_>
Then nothing would work till I used an uninstaller tool to get rid of all traces of Norton.
06wb Sky :3
12McAfee did that to me
10Thanks Xeli ;3
10:3*
06... xD
12Ew McAfee, I'll never use them again
I think Norton was also the AV that found 10,000 trojans and decided that it couldn't delete any of them.
06just a heads up, eh? :P
12Ew AV, get a full security suit
It was.
12Oh
Came with the computer or something.
12Ew trial security suits
Eww paying for security that is worse than free software.
;p
12Eww Ewwing paying for security that is worse than free software.
The best security is common sense
12XD
Eww using free software that is worse than paid
Or at least more buggy ;p
Avast! isn't buggy?
Avast is SLOW
All AVs are slow and crashy
Lol.
It's not slow?
Which is why I don't use a active one
02That's why I Stick with AVG 2011 and Common Sense.
02:D
It's using 0 CPU and only 7k memory.
Just use Xp Security Center 2011
Or just fix viruses you get yourself.
Or just don't get viruses at all
Geez, people whine about viruses
I wasn't whining about viruses?
I wasn't talking about you :P
Oh, ok.
ow
ow

12I have a cure for that

02:D
Ponies are for girls!
