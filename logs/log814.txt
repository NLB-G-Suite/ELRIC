jadusable disappeared a long time ago though
Well. I have a cartridge with no label and with the words MAJORA written in black sharpie.
funfact: i've never played majoras mask for more than 30 minutes. cause idk what happens that always makes me turn the game off

lets all watch wonderbolt academy http://cheezburger.com/45919489
423 Is best Number.
and the marine one has all the tension
but you've known him more than me so I dont know his real personality :P
He's always acted like that
cachi01 its all opinion, I like xenos too, but i liked predator's climax
Do you think the break up changed him?
But he's told me he's nothing like that IRL
I'm not sure, I've only seen him once since he told me it happened
xenos kinda lack personality
johnjoseco is a great suggestive pony artist
maybe he has a liking to you
The counter resets.
ITS ONLY 10:57!
ugghh
oh I doubt it :P
preds have personality and yet xenos are more interesting in their strains....im so torn...
well the xenomorph one was basically just killing everyone at your sight >:>
I'm glad you did that.

spoilers
ohai blachi

KnightLunair: You're watching the best LP of it
hi tehlonpon :)
KnightLunair: The original game does not have any music(It wasn't allowed to)
But that guy took appropriate songs and used the for his LP
bye guise
so how's everyone doing today?
Ohai thelonepony|Bioschoc, how are you? :)
thelonepony|Bioschoc: waiting for Dishonored to arrive
cachi01: You...never finished the game?

DO NOT SPEAK OF THE GAME; unless you FINISHED it
And understood WHAT the game was meant to say
but i wont finish it
is the running man good
BroPony|MEDIC: Good
wait, what game?
one of my friends didnt beat half life and I thought he did. When I asked for help and found out about it I freaked out.
http://d.hatena.ne.jp/video/niconico/sm19592344
i'm so confuse
tell me D:
thats a paddleing
damn disconnect
Alright. I just turned off my vhost. Next time I connect, you'll see where I'm connecting from. It'll be some public wi-fi hotspot place at a restaurant, if not the hotel in Cincinatti
k
Sumica OC pony <3
where?
How did you two get together?
I probably won't be around for BMN this weekend. If the hotel's internet can handle the stream, or if the cable carries The HUB, I'll be watching the new episode tomorrow episode. Otherwise, I'll have to wait until later for it.
the next episode will probobly include ponies
maybe
I cant wait for Bioshock Infinite :D
Rex_Mundi: :D
We had pretty much all our classes together freshman year
Is it 11:11 AM?
A 3rd Bioshock game? The first was about Objectivism, the 2nd was about collectivism, whats the 3rd one about?
he eventually asked me out when we were walking back from the ropes course thing we had to do for a class
wait no, that was the first time he talked to me >.>
rheumatism
I think technically I set up the first date
It was a department picnic on campus, so not really much of a date
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WDQ4FhslSk
there
He was half an hour late though... I still pick on him for it :P
:P
/me slaps DashWithRainbows around a bit with a large trout
you two mustive clicked then especially after him messing up
Vordox: yay LP!
yeah
I couldn't really blame him for it; he just got the time mixed up and went to watch his sister at a track meet
Sounds like something I would do tbh
lets plays r goodd
so i gess i'm too early for a movie night
/me shrugs
cachi01: LP?
Rex_Mundi: so, FiM RPG? :D
I'm really not good with times >.>
bo0oring: too early
cachi01: Hmm?
MadSurge: Yep, its some Doujin game some japanese Brony is makig, so its gonna take some time
My timing use to be perfect before, but moving really effected me :/
cachi01: You are not allowed to speak of the game. =P
lonepony|Bioshock, toooooo early..... eeeeeaaaaaarlyyyyyyy........
Rex_Mundi: for once, we infected japan with our animation!:D
lonepony|Bioshock, lol.
Vordox: Explain to me, what is LP?
tell me D:
no
:I
MadSurge: Its so awesome, a reverse anime situation
lonepony|Bioshock: Depends, you want the real Let's Plays, or the piracy fake let's plays?
Vordox: lelelelelel
Vordox: Real Let's plays
Ponies will create world peace
yeah, I get worse if anything new or unexpected happens
or create a massive war based on who is best pony
lonepony|Bioshock: Usually, the rule of thumb, no let's plays of games no less then 6 months after release.
Maybe japan will turn MLP FIM Into an Anime sort-of Style
Well, rarity is best pony, war over
wasn't i t 3 months?
when I came back from Thanksgiving break I completely forgot I was supposed to work on Mondays, so I ended up missing a shift
Uboa-San: Like how they made an Anime powerpuff girls?
These Let's plays go more into explaining how the games works, storywise, and a more deep meanings of the game itself, Even bringing out theories.
I think ill be glad when my classes start again, Have to get my mind off the crap thats still going on at my house :/
Theories. Might not be true.
the other lets players are just there shouting and im here laughing at how scared they are
Then we havet he Blind Let's PLays, which is a reactionary entertainment for people who enjoy surpising themselves, which also gives a more vivid look on the game from the first person perspective(Of course, the viewers that know think otherwise)
:( what's going on?
Maybe it will be the same style...
Ah, i see
hi Afflict
Usually, the Proper Let's PLays is meant to share and expand the love for the game they have, while Blind is more of a motivation for people to play games they never tested before. Which in some cases is fun. :)
It might be hard to believe but i still havent unpacked yet
Unless they got spoild.
spoiled*
I dont know, I get the feeling that if they made a MLP anime, they would make the characters humans but with tails and stuff. And get the characterization wrong trying to make it some K-On or Pretty Cure knock-off.
Uboa-San: Urgh,donÂ¨'t remind me.
I really don't want to deal with it, problem is things go missing very easily in the house
so if it isnt in my room it could disappear real fast
oh yeah i still have to finish ao oni
.-.
hey
Blind lets plays are the best
Don't tell me an imp has stole Majora's Mask.
cachi01: well, go do it
i liek pewds
he is funny
Uboa-San: Why would tirion lannister steal majoras mask?
You mean the Skull Kid, right?
lol
gangnam style has officially passed 1 billion views
yay the world is stupid!
gotta love the dancing psy next to the view counter
1,000,382,639! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0
xD
I start my classes Jan 2nd, so that gives me a little over a week to unpack the rest of my junk :D
I havent read it yet, but i think the story of 'a feast for crows' will be about commander Mormonts crow finaly finding Corn. :P
If Skull Kid stole Celestia's power. You know what Happens (Other than TO THE MOON Thingie Because she doesnt have her power)
i has a sad nao
wait dancing psy next to view counter?
That thing is overrated
you dont say
it was funny the first 3 times
^
If anyone bothered to know what the lyrics mean, they wouldn't like it so much
I thought it was some sort of parody video.
it kinda is, isn't it?
its making fun of gangnam
i think
http://i.imgur.com/g5Dkw.jpg

Work|AtBarbetos: shut up and take my money
It's making fun of Gundam

heres a better picture
oh, cool
where did you get that?
a collector
I only have a tiny poster that came in my season of flame box
String_Shredder: OH. SHIT.
I'm missing that poster :/
oh snap
unfortunately it was folded up pretty tightly so now it's starting to come apart
that was awesome
String_Shredder: DAYUM
String_Shredder: Agreed :D
SHE MIGHT WANT ICE FOR THAT BURN
I'm back from tvtropes. what happened?
I have a bunch of spyro posters in a cylinder
stuff happened
String_Shredder lol
Can you name all the stuff on my shelf? :P
burn happened
that too
Might be too hard to see though..
Who is gonna make the stream go Live?
who said what? I NEED TO KNOW!
hmm...
I actually don't recognize anything :(
Uboa-San: no one atm
except the keyboards...
while we wait
Go do something
the wooden box on the very top is an atari 2600
the one under it is a NES storage case
i just noticed something.....
That lays bag is actually a skylanders promo bag
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3N9bzNFHlA
in sonic & all stars racing transformed
oh, I
yeah?
what is it?
its covering a Sega 32x and Sega CD console
*I've seen those
bye everypony, i gotta go think
ANYONE BORED HERE?!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E452IGT09x4
Bye BroPony|MEDIC :)
the song that plays when sonic gets an all star sounds a little like pinkies theme
from fighting is magic
they have them at walmart
and tails doll is also there
So those are all consoles?
the stuff at the bottom shelfs are two atari computers, a commodore 64, and an snes
probably a cocendence right?
yeah
well..
Europa Barbarorum 2 = the best game that will ever be.
Vordox: the Trixie part i enjoyed
I guess they would be considered attachments
cachi01: Orly?
you would plug your sega genesis to your sega cd to play
the Sega 32x was ment to sit ontop of your genesis, think of it as a graphics card
you would put your game cartridge into your 32x then instead of the genesis
Have some George Takei
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNjuB_lwgQE
oh my
I would love to try it but you wouldnt believe how many cables are required for all of it to work
any1 play lol and up for a bot match?
If you combine the genesis, 32x, and cd your going to use 3 AC cords and at least 4 cables for audio/video
wow ._.
BUT
and I thought my consoles' cables were annoying
Ive heard that when you do that and play DOOM it kicks ass
/me spins
http://i.imgur.com/LzGxz.jpg?1
wow, takei got really old
Does it make sense as to why Sega went under? lol
Welcome to the wonderful word of...
Tripping
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwic0AwAj00
it was such a stupid move on their part
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tk0IWT9QUgg
Haha yeah, I guess it does
They eventually made a 3rd gen genesis that combined all of it
I just barely remember seeing the Saga Genesis in stores...
but I think at the time it cost over $600
and this was back in 95-96
or what was that called
The last one they made
Dreamcast
lol
you want to trip balls? have at it! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3JCESdFNyw
which didnt work out cause the playstation and nintendo 64 were pushing 3d

you can play a lot of SNES games on it
http://imgur.com/3nOXj
oh were you thinking of the computer? I ment on the actual console
I was able to get an image that had a huge library of snes games and the dreamcast is able to play them
Ohh, I didn't even know you could do that
yeah its real awesome :)
I played Puzzle bobble on it for a while, love the catchy music
Oo
Rex_Mundi: You call that JARRING?

Meeting?

HI Red_M
Rex_Mundi: *
damn
Needs more Twilight MadSurge
So I was theorizing, since the Pegasi were in olden times a military caste of ponies, what if that means they are still considered such in modern times. Like, there are different flight camps like the wondebolt accademy that train ordinary Pegasi as if they are all a sort of Pegasus Militia, and the official teams like the wonderbolts are full time military. like the Pegasi are like the swiss kinda.
Rex_Mundi you mean... Pegasi are the guardians of the Spiritual Leader of their Religion?
Lil_B: how was the meet up? :)

back, just finished applying for the license
cachi01 only as young Link... thinking about that... you can ride eponas as a Pony in Majoras Mask...
government employees are always so grumpy =/
epona*
yay
and then link got bored of searching for navi and he never found her again
the end
or he just died in the way
cachi01: link became the Heros shade in Twilight Princess
they deal with people like the person I posted above all day trying to get welfare cheques.
Rex_Mundi: thats a theory
I cant belive there is a official Timeline for Zelda now...
cachi01: No its confirmed
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: oh
Rex_Mundi and what a Timeline it is xD fuck the Fan-Split.Timeline Theory, we split them 3 ways!
According to the book Hyrule Historia, the Hero's Shade is a spiritual manifestation of the regrets of the Hero of Time, the Link seen in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask.
ikr
where the fuck did they got the 3 way timeline
Two time lines makes more sense
WHY DIDNT WE THOUGHT OF THAT
cachi01: you know what doesnt make sense?
cachi01: Link dies in OoT creates a 3rd Universe
How if link dies in OOT that leads to the fucking first game in the series
yeah i know
and thats the timeline we didnt expected
Im pretty sure You could fit the first game AT THE START
which created zelda 1 2 and a link to the past iirc
I actually still have this Book in my Amazon Shopping Card... just 23â¬ and free Shipping....
The whole link dies time like is stupid
wtf
*line
I have no words for that
For a Nerd like me... This Book has to stand in my collection...
I dunno, maybe Ganondorf so engorged with power he got stuck as a demon pig forever?
(got
i need to get hyrule historia..
I would get it but I lack the cash, and no way in hell my parents are getting it for me
Appearently, OoT was originaly going to have a 'choose your Girl' option, thats why there are soo many girls in OoT that seem like they really dig Link.
Link is pimp
chicks dig heroes of time
I still waiting for Kirby's 20th Anniversary to be released in Europe :( I want it so badly
Also I find it hilarious the origional OOT comercial had a sexist line in it
that or link is a giant robot
heh
pfff sexist line in Zelda... nobody of you played the german Translation of Link's Awakening xD
"Will thou get the girl, or play like one"
what was it Lil_B
The fuck nintendo
Lil_B: explain :D
Wonder if someone paid the artist to get that drawn
You know what the best game translation is?
Vietnamese Pokemon Crystal
Considering how much of a pretty boy Link is, it almost if you ARE playing like a girl when you play that game.
Volcano Bakemeat!
Id pay them not to draw it.
also
http://i.imgur.com/egGPx.jpg is http://d24w6bsrhbeh9d.cloudfront.net/photo/5986398_460s_v1.jpg
no?
Rex_Mundi: except Zelda 2, he's too tall and blocky to be a girl in there _D
:D
No wonder Link gets R63'd a lot, thats the gender flipe rule right?
I don't get it
Yes it is
alexxm MadSurge the Tranmslator snuck in some strange Lines, whioch mostly got removed in the DX Version. Like (even though this is a Songreference) "Not without a Condom, Give me your Jouce, I'Ãll give you mine". Or, when Bringin the Mermaid her Bikini, and she asks you to give it back, you can say "No" or "*drool*"
need to head out, bbl
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL6dJOLFtDA
k
:D
Wth
Im asking if they are the same person
I still say Vietnamese Crystal is the best translation
the hell Lil_B
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: elaborate please
what did that say SpadeKyurem|WoW
The likes are fuckign bizzare
alexxm yeah, but overall it was ok :)
xddd
maybe, they look pretty similar
Like putting a item in a bag goes [Player name] [item] bag fuck
maxmofoe: quote exodus 15:2, jesus said, We are sorry mario but our princess is in another castle
You also could get a really starnge secret Song when you entered "Moyse" as you name in the Title Menue, Moyse beeing the Name of the Translator :P
Seriously just google Pokemon Vietnamese Crystal and watch the insanity
g2g everypony cya
This brings back memories of Newgrounds in the past. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_j2FHtxB6I

Bye cachi01 :)
Here, the Moyse song satarts about 10 seconds in http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hETZLrQz_uE
Bye cachi01 :)
Oh it was on 9gag
bye cachi01
The DX Version had a Variation of "Totaka's Song" which can be found in many Nintendo games
someone thought it looked like a boob so they were like "hurrrr post on 9gag"
ncya cachi01 !
oh
I think that's actually her elbow, but okay :P
Lil_B: it was in the classic version too
bye cachi01
it is.
The shopkeeper in Link's awakening is fucking insane
MadSurge there are 2 Version of Totaka's Song in this Game, one in the House of the Frog Guy, andf one in the DX Version when you enter Moyse, but they sound differently
SpadeKyurem[WoW] yeah, that was awesome xD
and everyone would call you THIEF when you Stole something once xD
"YOU THIEF" *Force lightning*
Also for anyone who actually cared to do so, you get a scene of the girl flying off if you beat the game with out one death
Oh god, I can't resist http://ponybot.net/?i=3885
I dunno, this Zelda Title was my Childhood, beat both Version without dieing
in the classic Version you see her Flying across the Screen, in the DX Version you get a Nice Full-Screen Imagae of her :)

MadSurge is he from MLP? I know the 2 on the left and the Villian of Gen1 Pilot on the right, but I've never seen the Goat Guy
Lil_B & thelonepony: Close nuff
wait,... it was... "I WAS FROZEN TODAY!"
Lil_B: pretty sure he was from G1
/me walks back into the chat shivering

http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/6ecd4888533d4b7bc469de65886fa6de.jpg were we talking about the Legend of Zelda? :D
Whjy did nobody told me Spoony Started hiw FF 13 Review?!
MadSurge WOW! xD tha's awesome that someone made this
Lil_B: he went back on stuff he said about ff8! :D
MadSurge yeah, watching it right now xD
see all later
You should make a post on darkspyro about your game. It's much more active than spyroforum
Bye texasboykc09 :)
blasphemy!
but that's why we need more people to post on it :(
Link to DarkSpyro?
I hate when people complain the forum isn't active and then don't do anything to make it more active
yay
delicious
MadSurge I just saw the short FF13-2 scene with the flying Mog... I'm playing FFVI atm... Mogs CAN'T Fly!
Is there anything we can do? Other than spamming links all over the place
Like I said, just post
Good afternoon everypony :)
We all still alive? :D
people don't post because they think it's not active
Lil_B: final fantasy 6 is best final fantasy
BladedWings: yep :D
and it's not active because no one posts
Hi there BladedWings !
so if people would just post...
^_^ oh hey, is Meanwhile and/or Jmo here?
Good afternoon BladedWings ^-^
Bronysith yeah, Currently right before the Floating Continent, just wanna do everything I can do before entering the world of ruin
Lil_B: if I got it right, 13-2 just trolls you at the end with a horrible ending
Hi BladedWings ^w^
/me hugs MadSurge thelonepony Lil_B and MLP_Brovakiin
MadSurge I have never seen anything of this game except Trailers and ... well... I have the Soundtrack with ttaht Death Metal Chochobo Theme xD
Yay hugs! :D
/me hugs BladedWings back
oh]
:o
/me hugs BladedWings back ^-^
/me hugs Bronysith too just cause he is here lol
Lil_B: I just know of the dreaded Corridor
/me hugs BladedWings back :)
BladedWings he's playing Planetside 2 now according to my Steam :P
MadSurge yeah xD JonTron, Final Hallway, and Spoony is Bitching about it now too
Lil_B: ah oh well he'll get that hug eventually
Really i'm on the look out for Jmo and Meanwhile...AttackWithHugs wanted me to hug them for her ^_^
MFW when every time I breathe and cough I feel dog hair in my mouth: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1120/
Lil_B: they should just do what Sega did with Sonic the Hedgehog and fire the writers in block :D
Kipkat07_Scarf: ...dude, thats creepy
I don't post anything cuz I don't really have anything worth posting
Now I'm not sure if this was actually true but I heard SEGA fired their play testers when they said Sonic 06 played like crap
MadSurge they should keep the Audio and Visual Quality, but go back and try again with a Story and Character similart to their old games so they get a feel again >.<
well then you should actually take a look at darkspyro
and see if everything people post there is worth posting
good point
ok guys i'm gonna be in and out of the computer room since i have company over but someone please let me know is Meanwhile or Jmo shows up :)
*if
Lil_B: or try to write a more simple but less pretentious plot, pushing with the gameplay :D
it doesn't have to be "worth" anything; we just want to talk about stuff
<.<
if you want to go to darkspyro I'm not going to stop you lol
MadSurge yeah! FUnd that!
nah I'd rather stay on spyroforum
hello
BladedWings: I hate dogs. I fucking hate them to hell. My aunt has a huge fucking dog and she brought it over. My mom puts the dog in my room where it barks, scares my cats, and contaminates everything with its hair. The dog then licks me. I am sick so I already am in a poor mood. I cant fucking breathe without dog hair getting in my mouth. I fucking hate dogs.
The hell do you mean pretentious plot?
but from my experience all the users there are either trolls or whiny little fanbrats
how've you been Sceptileknight
I really tried to get into it, but they made it very difficult
yeah
Words cannot express my pure rage.
pretty well... strange message of dogs although
I have good reason to hate dogs.
i dont blame you but it was odd to see it right after i arrived
Should I make a new account on spyoforum, or would it be easier for you to change my name?
Sceptileknight: Thats how I feel when i get a giant message when I join chat.
changing your name is way easier
yes
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: they keep trying to shoot for the best plot ever, but always raising the bar means that they'll miss the target more and more, so they should do less "BEST PLOT EVER" and care about making a coherent story, no matter how simple
MadSurge: where the hell are you getting that from
Could you change it to Afflict? my old name's vCades13
sure
so what movies did you guys put in lottery
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: from 12 and 13 :D
thanks
if you cant tell, I havent watched ponies all week. Im sick, thirsty, and pony deprived. Im in a horrible mood.
i understand you... have some chocolate milk
watch the preview of the episode...
MadSurge agreed, I don't want something epic where I'm supposed to find my joy in, I want something enjoyable that can be epic
eponia: 2001 A Space Odyssey and Teenagers From Outer Space
done
I voted A: Metropolis , B: Manitous Shoe
I put Pirates Caribean 4 and THE POSTMAN
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: or at least make sure the protagonist has relevance to the plot, not just a random kid that hogs for the camera :D
I hope my B movie gets picked
i voted for the crow and the castle of caglistro
the postman is a good movie
JRPG tradition, the hero is always a teenager
Lil_B: that's why Dragon Quest 9 is so likeable, simple plot but HUGE post-story content
anyone want to stream anime... I'm thinking Sword Art Online
And most of the time the hero has crazy hair
who is streaming?/ up next to stream
no one atm
but there are images
eponia: no stream now, just fanart slideshow
And we dont know who will stream later
eponia theres no real schedule apart from fridays and saturdays
^
can we watch Sword Art Online?
So...
I can find a link to the first episode
eponia: is that an anime?
anyone wants to play minecraft....
yes... its similar to .hack
Sword art online? GOD NO! to be honest
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_bhwCgtXg Behold the insanity that is Pokemon Vietnamese Crystal
eponia: ask our mod Sumica when he's on then, he likes anime :D but he'll do it only if he wants to
mart ok never heard of it whats so bad about it
MadSurge well, I've never played Dragons Quest, but same with The Gaia Triology, it started slow, and it just showed you Stuff, it didn't overanaslyzed itself or pushed Stuff in our Faces, but these Games left Impressions in me
goodbye
im alive :P
Well, Sword art online is like a Same thing, boring character, same old thing like most Animes! I don't know, I just don't have a good taste of Anime
Ohai aniderp|bestcakeever, yay! :3
Some
hello aniderp|bestcakeever !
Lil_B: the SNES games are not bad, and the last two games are really good
hm, well just don't make a big deal about talking to her
treat her like any other person or you'll just seem nervous
Lil_B: also status spells WORK on these games :D
Ohai aniderp|bestcakeever :3
ok
MadSurge what do you mean? Don't they work in newer games?
I thought Sumi was a girl.... like with awesome boobs
and stuff
Lil_B: I mean that the instant death spells work on early bulky monsters with lots of hp :D
my jimmies are sooooooooo rustled this week. I need ponies to calm me dowm
Kipkat07_Scarf: well, you have youtube
Lil_B: and lowering stats is important with the more difficult bosses :D

Apple Family Reunion.... about the family reunion of the apple family
MadSurge it really is, first Game to make me Tear up... when Celes... off the cliff...
but spoilers are awesome http://ducatiforum.co.uk/attachments/f17/7434d1351408926-motogp-spoiler-silver-z-1.jpg
thelonepony: Its like drinking or sex, if you dont do it with other people it isnt as fun
twilight_sprinkle: true
So... How are ya'll?
and hi sprunkls

hai tehlonpot
hello twilight_sprinkle !

Lil_B: good times, and you could save Cid! (though it has no bearing whatsoever on the game/plot)
ohai twilight_sprinkle

hai BladedWings|AFK
well except for a adawable baby applejack... but I digress
eponia: no spoiler though.
MadSurge You gewt something later from him, but seriously, I would have never figured out myself how to save him xD

twilight_sprinkle: You'll soon get it

/me leans towards Lil_B and cries.

GOD. FUCKING. DAMNIT.

Vordox: I will
My family decided it would be a swell idea to leave a large dog that barks frequently with a sick 14 year old who is incredibly fearful of dogs and has two cats. *rages so hard that he turns into a black hole*
ohay thelonepony :P

Sweet

thelonepony|EDF_IA: one of the specifcs of the game is that you dotn have direct control voer units except for henchmen and the evil genius
*ove

:(
Meth I'm gonna make a post about all the spyro fangames I know of, you want me to add yours to the list?
How about you make a list of fan games that actually exist.
Yes
and not just vapourware and talk.
Hey
There's Blako's, that definitely exists
What's that supposed to mean SR?
Afflict If you made a post with fan games that people just said they were going to make, you'd be compiling that list for weeks.
lol
But make a list of actual fan games that have been made
'ones that are not just talk.
/me pokes chat
Like Mine^
Lets see yours then.
as far as I know it doesn't exist.
yeah, I'm only doing ones that actually look like they are relatively serious about it
Thats what I mean SR
/me picks up his cat and hugs him, reducing his rage level
That mine is just talk for now
Does it have a name yet Meth?
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/sample/12705f2343d68800f6de625514048252.jpg Oh Derpy :D
MadSurge: :D
hello

Something smart people have, derpy.

thelonepony|EDF_IA: It cleans up after it is done, what a nice robot ^-^

Hai guys ;)
Ohai Slenderman
Hey Slenderman :D

No that's for Mare-Do_well
Happy Apaocolypse everypony!
I sit here all day every day
And refresh EQD
more comics yay
Everyday i'm refreshing!
Is their a reason why were watching the same clips go over and over again? Not that I don't like it or anything.
afternoon everyone
Hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT :)
afternoon thegreatandpowerfult
Ohai TheGreatAndPowerfulT :)
/me glomps and takes TheGreatAndPowerfulT to beds
How's it going, TheGreatAnPowerfulT?
yup
Spyro 4
Sith stop with the bed thing Seriously.
Slenderman mmm can't complain, how are you ?
I literally just woke up only 10 minutes ago... AND I'M ALIVE!!!! NO FIRE FROM THE SKY
I actually thought I would die today a few years ago.
Is the world not ending for anyone else? It's been totally destroyed where I live.
me too what a derp dont you think
String_Shredder: Mine has been overrun by drug addicts, but that happened way before today..
"Many hot dogs are within you"
"Try Pepto!"
....this conversation is turning strange
I just saw the commercial right now, it's halarious.
ooo one of my favorite artists is doing a Q&A stream
Who?
^
ok....
i better go and play minecraft
getter
God speed my friend... may you build massive castles.
I wouldn't mind working on a game with someone
I developed my own polytheistic religon. Ponyism (you try and think of a better name :\) Celestia is the Sun God & Luna is Moon God. Mane 6 are the prophets. Bronystate mods are the patron saints. Trolls are demons. Elements of Harmony are the sacred relics and the letters to celestia are compiled into a holy doctorine
add on if you like
Im just bored as fuck
What movie is playing tonight?
RUnning man
were all bored
and Battery is not included
hell yeah running man
i am bored
I've never seen Running Man. Is it good?
Arney's always good
So am I
Slenderman: Do you like action movies from the 80s starring Arnold?
Kipkat07_Scarf: Or we could just go with a religion that makes sense, like somethign not based off of a cartoon.
anyone wantz to play minecraft?
its with Arnold Schwarzenegger
Wanna join mine?
mitamaking: Yes... yes I do.
Cause I am working on 2 projects. Spyro 4 and The Only Easy Day
Slenderman: You will love it
>religion
String_Shredder: Does religon make sense? Think about it.
Hehe, love the Terminator series.
>make sense
yeah I'll flip between the two
twilight_sprinkle: DOES NOT COMPUTE
Sure, what's involved?
Slenderman: I meant Commando, that type
Well carpenters dying for our sins and god making everything
Commando was awesome
I'm not really good at art, but I can program pretty well
mitamaking: You have all my yays.
Makes more sense than worshipping a cartoon.
Kipkat07_Scarf: CRITICAL ERROR CORE DUMPED
Can you learn UnrealScript and Lua?
String_Shredder: People worshipped a lot of strange things
The Only Easy Day is on UDK. Spyro 4 is on CryENGINE 3
Why are you questioning liking it, it is an 80s Arney action movie, you know what to expect and love, plus Dawson is so good as the villian
Anybody know the name of the movie with Coach Carter? I'm watching it right now, it's bomb.
i should start a cheese religion
there is a mitten religion. fact
3D games?
The movie's called Coach Carter
Awesome sports movie
Slenderman: Coach Carter?
i am watching back to the future 2
mitamaking: Hai guys ;)
ACHDHBSLIDF
yup
Sorry, my computer just screwed up, let me rephrase
Jedi is a registered religion in Canada
mitamaking: It's a basketball movie.
And in the UK
there is a jedi religion?
Well, a lot of people claim to be Jedi
You may want to find someone else then, I'm not good with 3D vector math
twilight_sprinkle: could i join ;3;?
If people can believe in Jesus why can't they believe in the force?
The jedi religion was created due to a way that Britian registers religions
thelonepony: You are always welcome.
thelonepony: mebbeh, mebbeh. what is thine favorite cheese?
What can you do programming wise?
cheddar
WAT
you have failed :I
brie is better
D:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
what derpy said
;~; i suck
brie is the god of cheese
No, he really isn't
yes
it IS
I'm good with lower level programming like C/C++ and Java
thelonepony|GTA4: but do you love all cheese?
twilight_sprinkle: I do yes :3
except taco cheese, that is an abomination
Hey everyone~
may the cheese be with you
how about Casu marzu?
thelonepony|GTA4: very well, you are accepted
Hi AngelLuna
That's the cheese maggots eat
hay angelluna
Hai, AngelLuna!
hoi AngelLuna
There is a church of the flying spaghetti monster
thelonepony|GTA4: Why hello!
i want a flying spaguetty
twilight_sprinkle: Good evening
Do not question the spaghetti monster
UnrealScript is like Java.
He will reach out to you with his noodly appendage
i ate the spaguetti monster... it tastes like muffin
Lua is exactly like C++, Except some Style diffrences
Slenderman: o.o hi slenderman o.o"
I've used Lua
Never seen UnrealScript before though
derpy: wait why didn't it taste like speghetti?
AngelLuna: Greetings, child.
oh
Because it was spaguetti duhh
Slenderman: o.o" ...................shou..should I be scared?
I can do 2D vector math, collision handling, event handling, and module style games
AngelLuna: It's kind of hard to take out an alicorn, so no.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnrealScript
But the only 3D experience I have is some terrain generation
Slenderman: o..okay! :)
Slenderman: Well not acording to the wedding episode
oh
mitamaking Because it was spaguetti duhh
Why not learn now?
Celestia got her flank handed to her
She was probably battling the Changelings while Celestia was "Dead"
Good question
Celestia's kind of 3-0 right now
3-0 terms of losing?
Please refer to this: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/05/story-slender-mane.html
Mostly because larger games typically have many people working on it
No wonder she sent team pony to handle the crystal kingdom
Love is in spaghetti
Does Celestia do ANYTHING to fucking help?
Luna vanished her, Discord unleashed chaos and Crysalis slapped her hard
yessss....NO
GAMES!!! DERPYS!!! Yu have all my YAYS.
She sends encouraging letters
She always sends Twillight and friends to do her job
The Celestia argument is way played out, do you really think Sombra could defeat Celestia?
that were already written.....
YAY
Well...can celestia work the stairs?
Well the problem I have is she's a fucking GODDESS
she gets taken down like a chump every time!
nobody beats my muffins
We have 19 people working on it
Its pathetic
Actually she's a princess
Not yet a queen
really? I never knew it was that much
Because queens are "evil"
Hello Every Brony
there is no queens in equestria
Fuck you disney for that stereotype
She could do a lot more, she is just testing Twillight, always testing Twillight, except during hte Wedding, then she lost
What about... actually yeah, queens tend to be evil
why is that?
I could kick celestia's arse any day
the whole testing excuse is bullshit
Well, the Spyro game has 2 people.
The other game has 19 on it
Luna could handle it
Test or not Celestia should do shit to help
Serenity: Well you are Sailor Moon, it isn't a fair fight
Marshal: because it sonds good
you're working on 2 games?
Teah
Yeah
function int example_function (int example_number) { example_number = 5; return example_number; }
sounds
1,000 year old princess. Just give her the title already
:P
Also I still hate that Celestia still hasnt fucking apologized for doubting Twilight
mitamaking: Well, mabye, but I'm also loaded to the absolute goddamn brim with guns
http://mibpaste.com/ACAENq
That is Hello World with Unreal Script^
>Raises Element of Magic for years like a mother, Doubts her instantly
muffin FIGHT
The fuck celestia
Well she does take a special interest in Twilight
Trixie takes over the town? Sure, whatever. Twilight enchants a doll? I'MMA GO DOWN THERE RIGHT NOW AND SHOW HER WHAT'S WHAT!
Maybe Celestia likes Vampires :O
At least the Crystal Empire, and I think Return to Harmony were test, Nightmare Moon took her out by surprise, and Royal Wedding, she got slapped down
derpy : yes shes dangerius that way
hi how is everyone
Also why the fuck did Celestia completly ignore the whole brooch?
What's the game about?
hi linkkirby
brooch>
3rd person tactical shooter like SOCOM
*?
what is the worst place in Equestra?
So Celestia used Discord as a fucking test
froggy bottom bog
Hey guys, I got a question for my fanfic. Would it be innapropriate to say that at Canterlot, their was a locomotive driven train?
SHE LET THE FUCKING GOD OF CHAOS RUN RAMPANT FOR A DAMN TEST
That makes it more difficult
The question is did Celestia know what Twixie did, she knew Twi went nuts(Thanks Spike)
saw the hobit yesterday :D
God damn it celestia!
the locomotive is the train
Kipkat07_Scarf the crystal caves
I know nothing about networking or ray tracing projectiles
trollestia
I mean it ran on coal and stuff.
Yes its atest to summon the EmpressFaust D:< by making her hallway filled with Glass windows D:<
Why do I still type Twixie, I know it is Trixie
I still say Celestia is a retard for keeping THE GOD OF CHAOS IN HER GARDEN
Ohai Suzano :)
It's still a locomotive. The steam engin drives the locomotive
mitamaking because you like it
Trust Me Bro, you can learn
I actually type in lisp
hat thelonepony|GTA4
We are really short on Programmers
HAI
If I trapped a god of chaos in stone I would put it where NO ONE COULD FIND IT
the GOD OF CAOS was in a maze. blame cherilee
ihate my keyboard
Not for public display!
But in the show, the train is driven by ponies who pull it. What if we took those ponies out of the euation, is that wrong?
Suzano: so do i
Also if one argument of two foals breaks discord free that has to be the shittiest seal ever
Slenderman just because
How many programmers you got?
2
2 out of 19
They only used the ponies to pull the train in over a barrel. After that they're all engine driven
yup
SpadeKyurem[WoW] point made
That's not incredibly bad
The rest is Art and Sound.
Equestria: Be happy or else
What about design and storyboarding?
Marshal: WONDERFU!!!! Thanks, my mind is at ease.
I kinda figured Celestia and Luna's spell went away after the elements of harmony were bestowed to Twilight & Co.
I design
Regardless
1 designer?
It should have taken more than one little argument to set the bastard free
But yeah, maybe Celestia should have moved the statue
You may want to find more designers, at least for level design
or cracked it or something
Marshal celestia is weak and helpless when hidding things
I mean leaving a god of chaos able to be freed out on display is a bad idea
Maybe Celestia wanted to show off her statue.
We have 3 level designers
I am the Game Designer though
Can we just say Celestia is a moron?
Well that was a pretty wizard statue
Hey, Celestia's just like us!
Well her track record is horrible
Remember Gabby Gum's awesome article? It even had pictures
Ah
First of all sending twilight 2 tickets for 5 friends
Marshal: HAHAHAHAHA That's frigging halarious joke. No, she's nothing like us.
celestia fails to hide things. Discord statue public place, elements of harmony a not-so-umpenetrable chamber, sombra in a glacier
Secondly sending 6 mortal ponies to deal with a fucking dragon
Celestia real name is Trolestia
Which are immune to magic for the most part
Good thinking there Dumblestia
Yeah, Red Dragon could have gone pretty badly
Unless that was another test
derpy: That was only on a few instances.
Her tests are bullshit
:p
Well, if you have some sort of repository, I can look at that
hey bronies, I think Twilight is being more calmer than usual with here not sending reports problems
arent red dragon's on the lawful side of the alignment chart though?
When has celestia hiden something really well.... She put me in a snowglobe that doesnt count
Or she doesn't want to botehr her and would rather die than trouble her
Repository?
She kept that crystal projector thing pretty well hidden
You guys don't use a repository?
Nobody even knew about the crystal kingdom
Git? SVN?
All Foals Day?
DropBox
Ah
Marshal but celestia and luna saw it disapear
I might switch us up to SVN. I need to set one up though
and they forgot it 6_9
Maybe they were just like >if it ever shows up again we can send the intern to deal with it
I shall now watch Cry plays Corpse Party.
or both princeses start using the elements like madmares
What can you really do with them? They seem more like nullifiers
And they give off a nice light show
Marshal Bake muffins????
Marshal they do pretty high damage also
Muffins of harmony
speaking of derpy, where the hell are the easter eggs this season?
she's still in hte opening, but that's it
Those are really powerful Marshal
I got lost in editing room... Blame the Doctor
Derpy and Dexter's dad would make a great team :D
Why DexterÂ´s dad????
Because he is the muffin king
Feed me!
FEED ME
and so on
There is no oven in the Tardis sorry
pony_7987 awesum
I like muffins
but there is a thermal core on the tardis yes?
So....
I think I am in love <3
?
wouldn't that iradiate the baked goods?
This girl
Have you tried to bake something there.... It is imposible and the doctor says it destort the fabric of something
Irradiated muffins are still muffins :)
Muffins are muffins and..... the doctor isnt here ill bake some
yaaaaaaaay!
what does this button do?
its the muffin button
em..gnc... only i cant read it
I though there were no more muffin buttons after Goku's incident?
quiet
there were none
muffin buttons dont taste like muffins
i think things are going well this season no ponies had a mental breakdown yet
YET
Well, my friends girlfriend
Oh yea
Scoots did have the night terrors
You told me a few days ago
oh
I feel bad for liking her
does that really count as a mental breakdown though
does it count like mental breakdown???
I love talking to her <3
And Talking to her <3
and Looking at her <3

Marshal: whoever did, he did that document a favor. It was needed to be put out of it's misery :D
:D awesome
I was there
what kind?
we were at a party last night
I missed the fun
we won the tablet through a raffle
:) um hi
Me too
Since when does MLP need a bucking religion?!
/me rages because he actually enjoyed working on it and did it as a joke
since we could post about Moon butt and Shed.mov
Since spaghetti flooded the world.
Storm_Flicker: Since it became awesome. And it has been that
Kipkat07_Scarf when i entered the document there was nothing left you should do backups
oh its a wierd brand name, but its a 7" and plays gagnam style real well with its two speakers :D
Kipkat07_Scarf: welcome to the internet
Sceptileknight: thats what Im going to do now...
um hi:)
You're going a lottle too far there, kiddo.
Kipkat07_Scarf, and what did we learn today?
Need help???
Kipkat07_Scarf: There is a wonderful invention called the undo button
GabeMoist: People are bastards.
GabeMoist Trolls are everywhere
well done lad
I don't think the undo button goes back that far
It has Android 4.0 on it
I don't think YOU go back that far GabeMoist

they were blasting gagnam style at the party we went to

I'm almost tired of hearing it
He is going to post more.
He left after season 2 and hasn't posted any season 3 stuff
yeah, it gets old
5lol
oh. I haven't checked on him in almost a year now.
I saw a tutorial on youtube of how to do the dance
I almost clicked on it :P
I think he got hacked or something
I never knew he was german
haha
Last time I saw one of his short clips was around the hearths warming eve episode
"How to look ridiculous at parties"
He's just gone quiet since the summer
I think it had 600k hits
The last thing he posted was "Your not going anywhere" Coincidence?

you don't have your own diner to sneeze on?
/me strips and streaks across chat
HEYYYYYY GUISSSEEE
Did you do that because its cheaper?
Yeah
heh yeah id do the same
it was basically free
$50 off and a $100 mail-in rebate
Its like the iphone, its super expensive until the new one is released then nobody wants the older model so its dirt cheap
/me takes Bronysith to bed
Got ya!
<3
yeah =/
:)
how much different can iphones be really?
Have fun~
battery life, weight
"43 hours later"
how thin it is..
Alchemist , that was wonderful, but my plot hurts now
brightness of screen, all that crap
consider it as payback
this one girl in my class was saying she hates her phone because the battery life is really bad
Actually not brightness, more like quality, how colorful
my phone sucks on battery life
and she wants an iphone instead because she thinks that will fix her problem
haha
Well the Brony documentary is cheaper now. It's gone down from $30 to $13
dinner time, brb
I love my phone, if it wearnt for its sucky battery life id be fine with it
But it could be bad because I play Pandora on it for a while
it's like "yeah I know nothing about phones but I'm just going to buy the newest most expensive one because everyone says it's the best"
New Brony documentary order link: http://www.scrnland.com/p/bd/

But I know youve got school coming up again, mine is getting close too..
haha, yeah, I'm finally done with school for a while, so I've got a lot more time now
and avatar
Dr_Fumbles: nah,
which reminds me, I haven't checked my grades yet... >.<
lol
I reallllly don't want to
the first, not a big fan of korra
I'm going to be so nervous on my first day
avatar the last airbender was fun, but i still think that animaniacs and Batman can still hold up to this day though
I still need to watch Korra
each class is only 6 weeks long
korra is weird
i cant get into it
korra is a bad show
Dat diminutive pirate
Cap'n Midget.
DoFINALLY SOMEONE AGREES!!!
korra is retardedly overrated
YES
this sounds like shaboobee
it cannot be compared to last airbender
yeah
The first was awesome, but korra... eww
5;p;
the last airbender had one of the worst endings ive ever seen though

it doesnt exist in this show doesnt it Sumica ?
I really cant afford it to have it kick my butt either :/

Just becauase its quick

Michael: call chuck norris

pfft NO ONE broke the 4th wall as much as the animaniacs
you really have to watch out for those ones where there are barely ever any assignments
Dr_Fumbles: ive not seen those two endings but the avatar ending was horrendous imo
aarrrr
AAARRRRRGGGH
I hate those
Well it's a good thing I didn't preorder my download code for the Brony documentary until now, since the price has gone down
I'm not too worried about the assignments, its the amount of material we will have to learn in such a short time
get one bad grade on a quiz and it looks bad for the rest of the semester

That's what I meant

Heh, Spike gets into construction in the future.
So Spike's moving up in the world then?

Pluto? HAH that isnt a planet anymore
Blown your mind as a kid, eh?

Oh boy this astronomy

So what was the reasoning to make pluto not a planet?
:D
00,10before men in black did it
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: size
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: too small i think
learning with the animaniacs :D
It has a fucking moon
AND ITS OWN GOD DAMN ORBIT
moar please
ever since I started using forums I thought it would probably be a good career choice
awww, more
SpadeKyurem[WoW], its part of an asteroid belt type thing
That counts as a planet!
10/10
errrrrrrrrrrrrrr
feed me more
Huzzah :D
11/10 would watch again
more wallnuts
SpadeKyurem[WoW], because there are lots of objects like Pluto out there in the Kuiper belt, and they didn't want to make all of them planets, too.
Waiting for the stream
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: "Nooo, some asteroids are bigger than Pluto, waaaaaah"
a lot of SR's influence tbh
RainbowAsh: Its not like they had to
Actually there is a theory that the multiverse is just parts of atoms to much larger species that has been around longer that either Animaniacs or Men in Black
Planetoid
Plus, Pluto and Charon would be more of a binary planet is it was a planet
oh boy here we go
Whats a binary planet?
its something like
welp im off everypony, love you...except for that guy
01010000000000101010101010101010
Pluto and Charon both orbit each other
bye Bronysith
Isnt Charon bigger than pluto?
I always thought computers were just something I naturally sucked at
Shizuka:
A lot of you getting in shit with your parents was probably me as well.
SpadeKyurem[WoW], last thing I heard Charon was smaller.
I have some news for you
Bye Bronysith

I'd say like 95% of it was

05,15Reb Brown/Schwarzenegger/Stallone/Willis Month
I get off topic so fast
The Enigma's review of THE RUNNING MAN: This movie is about as action-packed and adrenaline-punched an action movie you're going to see in a while. We see an excuse for Schwarzenegger being thrown into an arena with killers, where he must use his brains, strategy, and most of all muscles, to kill the stalkers. But the thing is, the excuse for throwing Schwarzenegger in the arena is a good one. They didn't completely ignore the plot;
Especially during streams

Do you want to know a crazy pokemon fact?
KrazyNoobs: Las t week but ponies are coming up next
By the way, the world is ending today.

The song...

She DOES have a point. if it wasn't stated in the rules of the contest, RD is in the right, even if AJ dosen't like it. :P
tony stark is the iron pony
I bet we haven't seen Derpy as much this season because maybe the current batch of eps were made during Derpygate and they didn't know what to do with her back then. Maybe she'll start showing up later on
SPIT
