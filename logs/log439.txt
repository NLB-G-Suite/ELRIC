I have a question...what's TF2's Gameplay?
(about Toonami coming back)
13war themed hat simulator
is it an FPS?
No seriously, look it up. Adult Swim is apparently seriously bringing it back.
when i play portall 2 online with my friend, i turn on sv_cheats 1 and spawn cubes and make the portals bigger.
I'm just a little emotional at the moment.
13wait you can make portals bigger?
Ja.
not being personal or anythin
13thought you could just disable non-portal walls

02cheap animation I made for fun
03sigh
get ownd
inb4 over 9000
I can predict her rhymes
02It's really 12 fps
02Since every frame is doubled
it wasnt a derp i mean:P

02makes it slower

inb4 pirates
yar har fiddledy dee
6most animations are done on 2s
6as in, each single frame is held twice
XD
inb4 yeah
02yeah
wait
^
03that's just wasting filesize though, if it's the exact same frame, then just lower the framerate
03o.o
and yes, I did just use 1337 speak
xD
6I'm not too knowledgeable on the exact reason
6but animating 24fps is advisable as opposed to 12
lol
6especially when scenes call for 1s
6you can easily switch between 1s and 2s when animating in 24fps
inb4 nyan
/me shrugs
Dung
the world may never know
Aw
/me nyans
nyanyanyanaynaaya
6in 12fps, you're essentially animating in 1s only
02so it's worth the waste in file size

its just tradition~
03well
03I kinda can't sleep right now
03too mad at myself
mad?
03yes
any specific reason?
03I stupidly updated this PS3 to the newest firmware, and it's basically impossible to downgrade it without knowing how to solder and spending $60+ in tools >_>
03and the newest firmware won't let me install homebrew
it is partially my fault for being vague
oh I am, wish granted
04Random? Maybe :P
03well
well
:P
03LL was considering buying this off me but, she'd have to sell her slim
you did say yourself the PS3 does nothing but be a dvd player right?
it doesn't need homebrew to do that
03yeah
03it needs homebrew to rip SACDs
03and play copied games
sorry
PS3 doesn't play games
xD
6lol.
03well
02drf, can it play PS2 games and does it have a CF card slot?

http://www.macworld.com/article/1161320/lion_quicktime7.html

04Nigel Thornberry is good...
>MFW
6quicktime tends to be convienient for me with animation
6it's the only reason I ever use the program
6whereas before if I just closed the program, they'd all be closed
6now if I open quicktime, they're still there until I close them manually
cmd-W?
6but yeah, with this stupid setup of opening quicktime with all the old videos on it
6it crashed finder earlier
6which is rather...crucial.

Saturn: can you stream ponies if you do you'll only be my second least favorite mod
Saturn: pm
He could stream Ponyta
It was 32 channels.
Not 32 bit, derp
sound is going crazy sometimes
back to buisness
8-bit musics for the win.
There's a reason people try to avoid using JS. :P

I must have missed it too.

/me owns it
But yeah....effing brother running out of gas
As if that might somehow change my initial impression of it.
Its still a good anime.
I can't say that thing that Saturn's trying to buffer is any closer to history.
uhm
I had to go take him some
You have no idea
Not too supprised.
08,01Kandarihu: it's not meant to be history; it's a discussion abotu education

DAT MUSIC

Pony I don't understand the amazingness of this food utility.
Added widescreen support, more colours, motion controls that sucked
and yeah
pretty much, maybe
:P
Pony: One does not simply understand pizza.
03PS2 has widescreen.
03just not natively
03it's per-game
GC is just as good as Wii
03and yeah
03Wii is just a wireless gamecube after all
Well of course pinkie pie doesnt do drugs
03>Nintendo
03>Using crappy hardware
also
well hey
I mean, understanding Pizza is actually more deeper issue, than a reguar Pizza culinarist would think.
Decent
03only 5 years behind?
/me flee
03yeah kl
03-l
Yeah
:D
If by "pizza" you mean Italian then I speak it :D
Cello Imvi
3DS is only 5 years behind too
*Invi
03more like 20
Yet N64, GC and SNES were all #1 or #2
03GameCube was a bit "eh"
did anything that the ship looks sort of like...well
Pony: why? :(
Some games looked pretty decent
Hard to find really good GC games
But
Star Wars Rouge Squadron 2 FTSW
03well

03LOL
03even Wii games are about the same >>
and loocked awesome
03and Wii has basically the same graphics

VLC
...I live daily with ALL Italians :D
Also
SWAGG
No improvements

You two, stop bickering about Italians.
The Sun is talking? I guess the Baby sun from Teletubbies grew up.
Thanks
...
I have fav movies though, i.e. 1, 2, 5, 8
Pony: :'(
I have no idea
It's a TV series. Lexx
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4277/
08,01Pony: all streams are official streams
08,01from our government, to you!
03I can't pick favorites either, but it's one of them
From one of the mods, to us

Pony: Pleasure and pain... ;)

03that's a known piracy server too
Right, there we go.
TARDIS?
14skydroid

I approve of that
Skynet has the stream!
I like my GV
GC
and 3DS
which OS are you using Saturn?
is a waste of money
lol
besides I have come to a conclusion that italians are worse wine facists than french
Here we go everypony
14oh well, if you have a GC I can't blame you x3
LAWL
14most of my games are GC ones
14:D
:D
03LOL apps
14you can play 3DS games without 3D
14o.o

03apps are the downfall of our society, i swear
14it's a bit controvertial
Pony: They have brilliant pizzas...
And my DSLite is fine

No.backwards compatibility
whoa, no kick for bold
Sky
14you can play DS games on a 3DS
14o.o
except when it comes to sharing, naturally italians hate spanish wine, but when you ask to have the bottle they accidentally bought, you cant have it, because they think I drink too much.
hmmmm.....
03inb4 taking suggestive 3D photos
inb4 you only use bold
03makes it worth the while
03I mean
03hi
I use my GC + GB Player for gbc/gba games
14lol
I still play GBA games.
lol
hello everypony
no sound.
no sound. how unfortunate
Well, this is riveting
03<Viri> you can play DS games on a 3DS <- they look like complete crap, too
the mods with color kick must be gone
hmm, audio is quite behind
Some look like crap
14I don't mean that sucks
mods asleep, post colors
08,01how odd
03no, all of them look like crap
03:|
ospit
08,01there should have been sound
08,01ah, sod it
its way behind.
08,01someone else can take over
lol
sound came on eventually but then the audio lagged
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/468/
03inb4 Gameboit
Even older than GBA
there is sound, but it's lagging behind
03*Gameboid
Saturn?

Replace the batteries, derp
yep.
I think next time a position opens up I'll apply for Modship

Tear down the wall!
14one was mine, one of a friend
Oh, the TV show?
14I completely screwed up in the first one though
I really like The Trial.

/me shrugs
14since the savefile would reset if you don't play it for 50 minutes
%Co
beep boop
wat
14the second one was fine though
Okay
Bah, computers can't do anything random.
randomly*
2,6What happens if you swap them round...?
you could program it to do things randomly
7,11Dont really care that much
XD
:3
6,2Fair do's
Yeah, but it can't actually do it completely randomly.
08,01Kammerjunk: it can if it get random input as the seed
08,01for example, a quantum event
Lol jokes

Cologno Monzese, Italy: Clear and 66°F(19°C)

12,2:3
08,01i forgot the "intermission" on the end
Pony: then you're going out with the wrong person,
1,12:P
hmm
the intermission lies.
You're right I won't
as always
I dunno how
GAH! THE BRIGHTNESS!!!
oh wreks
Pony: then the fact she's Italian shouldnt matter.
the little preview thing shows them a bit differnt
pffffffft
its annoying
I'm sorry, but I detest racism and discrimination, having gone through it myself.

otherwise, I wouldnt care.

11,2I liek ponies :3
03back
03and sigh
08,01there's nothing wrong with italians; they make awesome food
Wb
03dunno if I should nap or just stay up
It's all about love&hate relationships, they annoy me, I make fun of them (Mostly with stereotypical jokes), they can bare that and we get along. If they get too annoyed, they make fun of me, then we have a stereotype war for few hours and go for a drink. But really, I guess I'd complain about any nationalities I had to live with...
03I got less than 3 hours of sleep last night
Damn I wish I knew how to use colors
oh wait

14I've been used with the DS one for years

oh
now you went too far
Saturn, make sure you film it
lol
Yeah, I just ordered a bunch of archery equipment, but nopony in here cares about archery anyway.
just BURN *maniac laugh*
03DS Lite does suck yeah
03but my point being
14I guess that the best thing ever might be a modded DSL with DS d-pad and DSi brightness
03a non-DSi system
03no?
wut
08,01Pinkies4thWall: basically
14because of the GBA compatibility?
I wish I knew about archery
08,01oh hang on, i'll stream it
