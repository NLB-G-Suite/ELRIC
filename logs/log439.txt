hey Ingwaz
sunderlandpony89: Fatherland? I thought it was Russia.
My verdict? Somebody exposed the chat to excessive amounts of adoracute, thus inducing diabetes, heart failure, kidney failure, brain hemmorhaging, and intense psychological trauma, all at once.
yo MahBoi777
Now the only question is: what MONSTER would do this?
phobos2390: Fatherland = Germany. Motherland = Russia
So DRF, I glitched up a minecraft squid today
soviet Russia > Nazi Germany

RAWRity: Ponies! :D
11,02I LIEK PONIEZ :D
kenne: well thats cause people are assholes

My Dad owned a pony car in the 80s

Hi
phobos2390: sure thing
DaringDude: how are you doing?
kenne: Well, it's not like it's an impossibility. You forgot the neither option, though.
/me will now google this
MahBoi777: might, or it will teach them respect... a good shit kicking can change a persons opinion of you pretty fast
SaxyPretender: now I'm just hoping they actually make it a real comeback, and not just a tired old block of retro anime.
SaxyPretender: we got to stream Toonami when it starts back on Saturday
Gunthler: YOU TELL LIES
13i am not here >>
I was excited about Toonami and got kicked :s

The problem is that I don't own any right now...
DaringDude: My reaction to Civ 5, TF2, and the Total War games :\
/me 11,01hugs Shizuka hallucination <3
Toonami had better play Hamtaro when it comes back. That was their best show.
/me 13hugs everypony

GUYS. I have a problem! I try to hug Shizuka...but I go right through her!

lol, Diablo 3 got metacritic bombed. XD
/me hugs Shizuka back
.......................................................
Midnight_Tempest: true, but that works about 50% of the time, just sayin there could be other ways to handle it
Wait werent we supposed to play today or something?
Wait. I was a Hamtaro fan when I was in High School. Coming out as a brony won't surprise my folks.
or did we mis that
DaringDude: Even though it'll never be as good as Minecraft on the PC
true
May I ask why this show has never been streamed? http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&NR=1&v=pFajpTXRUMs
lol i just realized that most the mods nicks start with S... DID THEY PLAN THIS? :D

It even has Tim Curry in it
/me is almost crying
/me hates his computer. So much.
I have a question...what's TF2's Gameplay?
What's wrong Marx?
i lag with 360p vids sometimes
/me hums while Youtube loads slowly
(about Toonami coming back)
What rock are you hiding under phobos2390?
13war themed hat simulator
is it an FPS?
13Cobellanez: PING PING PING EVERYPONY PING THIS GUY <3
The Poop That Took A Pee by Leopoad Butters Stotch XD
MahBoi777: probably is better ways, but this is why i would be a bad father... kid does something stupid, beating... kid steals shit, beatings... kid talks back, beatings... respect is earned, not given and sometimes you have to also just take it by force
Shizuka: But what about us who can't get hats :<
/me noms on Cobellanez
Cobellanez:
Cobellanez: Ping!
No seriously, look it up. Adult Swim is apparently seriously bringing it back.
Shizuka demands it! Coballanez: PING
SunderlandPony: one which has a rule where I can't play M rated games.
Cobellanez: PONIES!!!
when i play portall 2 online with my friend, i turn on sv_cheats 1 and spawn cubes and make the portals bigger.
id ping if i was in a mood to bug the hell out of someone
I'm just a little emotional at the moment.
13wait you can make portals bigger?
phobos2390: lol how old are you?
DaringDude: Damn man that's horridly slow. My internet is at least fast (although it cuts out due to bad wiring)
Ja.
but im kind of a solemn mood now
not being personal or anythin
:c
13thought you could just disable non-portal walls
1,3:3
with a command.
DaringDude: 17...
....
/me cries
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/5umzofazekyys-fmmukkea2.gif
SUX
i forget the command
1,3need 1 more for l4d2, anyone interested?
Oh gawd, Butters is crying! WAAAAAAAAH
ME?
DaringDude: oh hey, i found a music disc
kirzstryfe: how much does that cost right now?
RAWRity: thats great XD
wait, l4d2 is laggy.
3I'll stream it one day ;3
LunaTheBeloved: It's like...Power Rangers! If it was more hilariously awful than it already was!
but the code starts with portal2_
1,3$20
kenne: in like a spawner or did u hav a skele kill a creeper?
Man, I need to get L4D2.
DaringDude: The family rule is that I can't play them until my younger sister is 17 years of age. She's 8 right now...
HA
DaringDude: in a dungeon with a spawner and loot crates
phobos2390: That's some fucked up logic right there
im sorry though
why cant i find hats? ;n; i want a stout shako.
kenne noice which one u get?
phobos2390: Well. You have moving out to look forward to, then.
DaringDude: also now i have a diamond sword and all the lapiz lazuli i need to make light blue wool and magenta wool that ill need
all da wool
SunderlandPony89: I think the reasoning is that she will try to watch what I am doing and will be exposed.
LYRA, Y U NO GET OFF THE SCREEN?!
/me laments his lack of hat in TF2
kenne is that the same world i was building dat wood platform in
DaringDude: i think its called 13, sounds like cemetary music from MK
making portal tests cutie mark!!!
keep spamming mouse1 when it starts to load next map
spam it
now
phobos2390: It's still fucked up. Just dont have her in the room when you're playing the game, problem solved. Her seeing one image isn't gonna hurt her into a killer (and it wouldn't anyway)
aww
Edgeless Safety Cube. Genius.
DaringDude: i think so, like where you had a half wooden house with a stone well and some farmland?
kenne well that sounds depressing and kinda creepy
kenne yup :)
lol
SunderlandPony89: Yeah...
WAIT, I'VE BURNED MYSELF WITH MELTED PLASTIC THATS LIKE GOO
DaringDude: thats a good way to describe it, i feel like theres death creeping behind me at every turn
WTF is Portal 2 rated?
phobos2390: You should bring that point up with your folks if you haven't already
http://i.crackedcdn.com/phpimages/photoshop/7/3/0/129730_slide.jpg?v=1
very, burning goo. ;n;
DaringDude: eeyup that world, if you ever get on ill invite you and you can continue to build
SunderlandPony89: I got in trouble for playing Twilight Princess in front of my 10 year old brother.
thatssss a very nicesssss sssong u got therr shame if anything were to happen to it
DaringDude: Have you got the When Pigs Fly achievement yet?
The_FaN_Scout: that hurts like hell
SunderlandPony89: not yet
SunderlandPony89: I had borrowed it from a friend.
:( My littlest brother is now 19
Eh, my stream's lagging...maybe I'll just go play a certain MOBA.
SunderlandPony89: I still can't buy T Rated games.
they grow up so fast TT_TT
phobos2390: ur life must be miserable
South Park isn't on anymore.... >_<
phobos2390: play ALL the sports games!
DaringDude: Well...It just means that I play a lot of nintendo games.
phobos2390: God damn man! That's just dissapointing! Your folks are ridicously strict. Agian, you just bring up the point that your siblings shouln't be in the room when you're playing "to mature" games
/me pokes her head into chat
that too
/me hugs LunaTheBeloved's head

VERY stupid question here...does anyone else here play League of Legends? I'm sick of playing with random people, because I tend to get on the crappiest teams...

ooooooh
SunderlandPony89: i havent tried to get it but it doesnt sound to fun
i'm back, what did i miss?
phobos2390: I'm guessing SSBB isn't allowed?

oh'
Super Smash Brothers Brawl
SSBB isn't bad
Reikim: ha i know that feel just tormented soil all day and no one can fuck with u
Yeah I know
phobos2390 can't be all that bad since you seem to have a computer and access to a chat room like this as well as being able to get away with being a brony, which I am assuming they don't know of course.
not with spell shield nd all
SunderlandPony89: I asked my dad and he said that he didn't want T rated games in the house before my 8 year old sister turns 13.
MahBoi777: But it's rated T! That's to mature!
DaringDude: No other champion lanes mid harder. Period.
/me checks to see if Battleship is failing on Rottentomatoes.
Barbetos: They know about me being a brony.
So how is everypony?
SunderlandPony89: NO M is mature!:D
See? Ain't so bad
i dunno i got a mean mid lane evelyn
has anyone seen the secret level in Diablo 3 yet?
no
stir fry
I am JUST DANDY. I think.
is it pony related?
hmm

does it have ponys?
Barbetos: What's interesting is that I see worse things on my computer than I see in my games.
maybe >.>
I should do laundry tonight
brb
Happy B-Day
Barbetos: having to "get away" with being a brony is stupid. I understand the fear of rejection from your parents. I was wondering what my parents would think. But actually being not allowed to watch it is stupid
phobos2390: At least you have ponies. I, myself, can't imagine not being able to play my T and M rated games

SunderlandPony89: Yeah...I have managed to download the Resident Evil Revelations and Metal Gear 3d Demos. Two days later my parents found out and my dad freaked out and deleted them.
Indeed and wheneve my bros get pissy I just take my bat and said. "What did you say about fluttershy?"
^
DaringDude: I play Impostors like a baws :D
Ingwaz Eh. Not so much of being afraid of being a brony, I would be more worried about over active imaginations of parents who are over protective and see the brony culture in a peculiar way.

SunderlandPony89: but not before I had played both to their completion.

Pretend to be hyper obsessed with ponies. They'll want you to play M-rated demos like a man.
Barbetos: thats part of what i was talking about. people really just need to get their heads out of their flanks sometimes and just look at things from an objective perspective
but
phobos2390: At the very least, you should be able to play SOME computer games. Just keep your siblings off the computer.

SunderlandPony89, ignore what?
Hello SaxyPretender, and SunderlandPony89.
Another 4000 words down, another 2000+ words to go.
I'll enjoy all 6 minutes of it, thanks :)
you must ignore the grand galactic inquisitor
Champion_of_Harmony: You've posted that same image several times already...
panda: That random guy saying ponies are for fags
MahBoi777, this exchange of plesentries is what all true warriors strive FOUR!
O U
I just wonder what the trolls are up to
you sure? I was sure it was a different pic
lol
MahBoi777: hi
Champion_of_Harmony: Same one everytime
MahBoi777, can you explain something to me?
Good night, Bronystate. And for the love of God don't give TheMaster a portal gun. Celestia knows what he'll do with it...
LOL I just tried ctrl S here
hey Pinkies4thWallXbox!
I've been working too hard
ah, well i hope you had a great one then :P

Reikim, night night

MahBoi777, why is lyra a seapony? O_o

panda: Because of reasons
panda: cuz it's adorable:D
hmm
that sunds bad
http://www.slate.com/articles/business/gearbox/2012/05/hybrid_and_electric_cars_too_quiet_why_they_re_dangerous_to_pedestrians_.html < a whole new spin on 'silent but deadly'
not bad
because...SHOO BE DOO
That makes it 22,000 words together. /sigh
RULE 34 IS A BIG EXAMPLE OF WHAT MY LITTLE PONY SHOULD BE
Yeah
MahBoi777, well does lyra have some sort of connection with the shoo bee do?
anyway it was an analogy about cutains. What the author ment and what your english teacher thinks.
Pretty fun
It's adorkable LOL!
pony_4875: I AGREE
a minecraft server would have been more fun though
want the .wav s? :p
naah
too difficult
no thx
did u get it?
SunderlandPony89: Anyway...It's only on occasion that I wish that I could play more mature games, but other than those few times I haven't really felt excessively restricted. And besides, my friend also has a similar restriction on M rated games (not T rated games though)
because lyra was trying to become a human and accidently entered into the g1 dimension
gtg bye
we need a kalleria server
would have been awesome if you downloaded type wild as well
XD
we /did/ have one though
:p
panda: lol no
SunderlandPony89: Ha
Take care ThisgirlLovesbronies.
no
wild type sorry
Goodbye ThisgirlLovesbronies
see ya
Hey guys, you know what to do with haters.
no
love and tolerate them
goodnight ThisgirlLovesBronies
it's type wild
XD
Like the curtans were blue. Your enlgih teacher thinks they repersent sadness and his inability to carry on.
Everlasting_Joy, love and tolerate?
english*
I was going to say ignore them, but that works ;).
squeeze them with... um, love?
0,14I prefer the ban approach.
the aurthor ment they were fucking blue!
lol saxy
lol
phobos2390: I'm not sure I could live without mature games since I've played mostly mature games for most of my life
SaxyPretender, well that works too.
O_o
You got exploded good
SunderlandPony89: We just live in different households then.
phobos2390: We truely do :P
I usually play boring strategy games. They tend to not be high on the 'mature' side. They sure are complicated though.
Why must I have 9/10 of my story be a mystery buildup and then 1/10 be epic reveal battle tumble
banning works lol
Also best mature game is Plane Scape Torment.
I usually play kiddy nintendo games.
No game is better than PS:T.
Tovler: Me too.
:p
the only apple products i ever owned
PS:T?
was an ipod nano 3rd gen
and an ipod touch 4th gen
pfft
Plane Scape Torment
Oh Hello Bronystate, I Bring good news!
the only apple products in this household were
never heard of it

oh its you jake :P
Ever heard of Baldurs Gate?
and an imac 3g that someone threw away
hai Jaketehsnake
and ipod nano 1G (crappy thing) and ipod nano 4G
Community test chambers, why do I get the feeling someone would design something monsterous?
Tovler: I haven't played the metroid games after super though. Actually I've only played super and the original. I haven't played brawl but I did want to buy it (my dad wouldn't let me)
and i later scraped for parts
guess what
Jaketehsnake: what tidings you bring?
Howdy Jaketehsnake, what news would that be?
hey Jaketehsnake!
we didn't buy either of those
Harmony. Do you like western rpgs?
Yeah...
so I haven't given a single dollar to apple :>

Or possibly stick figure cutie mark
JK I liek bananas :3
lol
phobos2390, dont lay it on too thick, girls hate that ^^
Celestias mane looks like toothpaste imo
panda: you mean come on too strong?

The key to success with the other gender is simple. Treat them like a person over as a distinctly not person, female thing.
THE BRONY COMMENTARY
phobos2390, yeah...
You know, the 2nd season finale totally josses this.

He's busy courting the brony vote, obviously

You never let me have ANY fun.
XD WTF?
Until you all shit on me:D
fffffrrrriiiiiiiiIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEENDS
panda: I actually went on a hike with her and that was pretty much the longest I spent with her.
Don't look at me like that. You're the one that acts like the battered girlfriend. All I want to do is conquer ONE planet. Can't you go find some other place to hang out?
LOL
TheMaster: Oh yeah, I get to save teh universe every 5 minutes and I cant come here to relax either can I TheMaster?
Are we saying Carebears will suck?
o.o @ This song I'm listening to.
cause it will suck
phobos2390, well take her out on a date ^^
The REAL hub people said "NO, that was just over enthusiastic advertising agenciy crap!"
This is what happens when you get too high on friendship
If they were Care Boars, I'd watch it.
Nittany_Discord: what's this called?
No, do you even like cartoons?
What is this Called?
The bears look ok, but that human looks creepy.
what are cartoons?
TheMaster: everyone loves ponies
"cho"
They would have to do something INCREDIBLE to make Care Bears work for US.
I was disappointed in Harmony's voice in the new Care Bears :I
Yeah, apparently you like them so much you went and visited. Pff, atleast I hid mysel...uh, I mean...
wtf....??
lol
panda: Yeah...I WAS planning on doing that, but I haven't ever gotten to that.
Has Care Bears been on yet?
phobos2390 ^^
TheMaster: you're mad that I get to visit equestria in the TARDIS
I'd love a Gummy Bears Care Bears crossover
"eat it"
.....Why don't you just let me borrow it for a bit.
so you can steal it again?
Sabrina is on the Hub now :)
So I can conqu..visit Equestria
dooooown
I'm not letting you steal the TARDIS again
teh Hub
Your ass will sure come in handy :D
Fluttershy used dig. It's not very effective...
Oh my
If I ask nicely can you just...give it to me?

MahBoi777: He's in denial... for now.

Bobby definitely has ADD
isnt obsessive compulsive disorder kind of an oxymoron?

Hank's a cocaine salesman after all.

MahBoi777: So now I have TWO friggin people to do something they don't want to do!
panda: A lot of stuff...like how I got depressed in the beginning of my sophomore year...I wasn't thinking much about it at the time...
phobos2390 hm...
wut
SayWhat: well good luck with converting them lol
dale would talk about mlp as being some sort of vast conspiracy. Hank would sigh and say 'that boy aint' right" when bobby watched it. And boomhauer would give a very, very quick speech about something.
0_0
what is this show again?
My friend took Aderol, but it turns ou, he actually has ADD... So it had the right effects on him. He got to round 42 on zombies :3

Oh shit, There's a moth in here

Be right back, where's my lighter
Lal
Lawl
Is it a Luna Moth?
03why would you WANT a Wii UI
03at all
03LOL
poor moth
panda: I also talked about how I interpreted the events in relation to the two of us.
I don't see it like thay
That
Exactly
Wii OS is built for games specifically
you wouldn't XD
dale was the best thing in the show
phobos2390, did you forefully make out with her face?
Wierd
the reason you buy a mac is to run OSX
Dale is a robot from the futurepast
And its hardware is different from.a PCs (and a lot worse)
Bill Nye!
BIitch!
panda: What? No! I've never kissed a girl in my life!
and Mac OS is built for Macs specifically
Whereas a PC is ultipurpose with varying hardware
if you're using it for other OS most of the time you're defeating the purpose - go buy a PC instead
o_
Suuuuuure
phobos2390: dont... forsome reason it worked for me lol XD
03and well
its not a race, you'll make it in your own time.
Drf hahaha
panda: don't kiss a girl?
03the only reason OSX appears to be more stable than Windows is because it's only built for the incredibly limited hardware that Apple approves
this version of bobby is so disturbing...yet so hilarious
Beeaautiful
And again iOS dev
phobos2390: Kiss guys?
O}_{O
XD
Hey MAH BOI
03try installing OSX on anything else and you'll have even more issues :P
Make a GOOD app :p
phobos2390, no i mean forefully make out with her face XD
MAH BOI
Hey MahBoi777
XD!!!
XD
Heh
true drf
hey Pinkies4thWallXbox!
what...the...fuck

So drf
DOoaaah
dat incest?
phobos2390: ^^
03Windows tries to incorporate drivers for all sorts of different hardware
hey DeadlyPony3!
...
03on certain models, it works perfectly, nop roblems
03there's just too many variables
Hey Mahboi777
03which can lead to Windows crashing
03:P
03same goes with Linux or anything else
LOL
this is weird
Dat punch
Lets say I build a wii with hardware like 4x as powerful as the priginal components
Do it again!
Yes!
Poor coney. She could so do better than either bobby or uh...whats his name
lolololol

03and stick to the crappy Nintendo games?
/me runs
Like am emhanced graphics card by the same company etc
Dat head
what???

joseph. thats right.
Would the OS have problems? XP
03yes
phobos2390: XD
03it would
All shall love me and despair
oh god I smell murder

03my a** is not plain thank you
03but basically that.
in place of a dark lord you would have a queen!
We need a good King YTP.
XD
03video game hardware specifically
that part was my favorite in Fellowship
YES
03is custom made for the developer
phobos2390: i knew what you meant... i have... yeah... i was a jerk in high school >.>
Boggle?
03because they don't want random computer nerd to be replicating their stuff for much less
Oh Yeah, This one
03as let's face it
Kk
SUNDAY
03a Wii probably costs $50 or less in parts
What if I make a superior chip that takes the same instructions xP
03then you'll be god
03anyway
panda: Yeah...She got asked to prom by another guy and she helped me find a girl to ask out.
LOL
03I actually have an external USB DVD drive
:O
you could theoretically
03that's the same specs as the Wii
Racist.
NOT OKAY
03because it's made by LG
03who made the Wii drive
Bobbycumyan
panda: she was also in my prom group
03and "accidentally" made several mainstream market ones with the same hardware
03:P
but you'd need a whole lotta time & labour
Oh FISH

great. posting that link made me sick
phobos2390: yes but I am somewhat lazy...
particularly since I just finished my sophomore year of college
Sylandest: Well, I can't exactly send it to you...
phobos2390: hehe, no need, I'll find it someday when I muster the energy
I'm going to hit the hay folks. G'night!

wow ok
so because finder crashed
Sylandest: I just finished my freshman year of early college and have my last few weeks of high school left until the summer
gnight Everlasting_Joy! take care!
the entire bar on top that controls stuff like ACTUALLY POWERING DOWN
was gone
phobos2390: enjoy them. savor them. you will miss them dearly
I had to force power down my laptop
07woooooooooooow |D
Sylandest: College is both harder and easier than high school
Sylandest: High school?
that's not all
you mean the widgets at the top right?
to by presing the power button, it gave the option to power down
but it got frozen at the "power down" screen
so yeah
Sylandest: this is the first time where I don't want the school year to end.
>.>
f* you lion
phobos2390: aye, high school. and I agree on college's difficulty being between hard and easy
first day, you're hell to deal with
ohai Sylandest
howdy, MahBoi777!
the widgets at the top right are controlled by systemUIserver iirc
Sylandest: It's harder in that you have more study time, it's easier in that you don't have as much busy work.
phobos2390: my writing in the disciplines class would like a word with you, lol
disconcur. hated HS at time, still hate it. My personal hell would be an eternal junior year.
wb
Sylandest: So how many credits do you have under your belt
hen3ry: yeah, but I have only 2 classes a day.
03thanks
11,02I DID IT :D
Is the stream broke for anyone else? :o
phobos2390: hmm...I would guesstimate almost 60 hours of classes, 18 of which are honors level
stream is derp
07I BET YOU ARE WELCOME
k

Sylandest: I currently have about 35

07I can't be sure if you're welcome or not
SuperBrony64: I can't see it
Sylandest: I am trying to get my associate's degree before my high school diploma
phobos2390: ...is that even possible? :O good luck by the way
That means I need to get my generals completed
possible yes, but tricky
11,02Gimme min

Sylandest: Yeah, but you do have to do a lot of stuff to stay in.
03LOL
But it still is a very good deal
i dont drink, coffee, i wonder if it would help, altho ill need it more in the morning. i actually feel decent now, ill feel like hell in the morning
better than having student loans around neck
phobos2390: aye, it is
i hate morning classes, yet i always end up with them
6wuh
07of course, if you do want to find yourself, I'll be sure to tell you to stay if you come back before your return
6;-;
twilight_sprinkler: only drink it if you can handle it
Sylandest: idk, i probably shouldnt try it
twilight_sprinkler: so when does your college have finals?

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHr5mi9graw&feature=related
/me hugs Sylandest
/me hugs Nittany_Discord :)
Sylandest: to each his own

phobos2390: lucky you. all of my physics are in the morning. funny thing is, that the classes i took last term are now available in the evening. next term im taking 8 am physics classes T_T
6lol
/me hugs everypony, starting with DaringDude
she either eats it before i take it
or i take it and she eats it out of my hands
phobos2390: its actually engineering, were doing matlab programming

oh... so it is important then the order
hen3ry: life trolls me always..

twilight_sprinkler: matlab...Is that a text based language?
twilight_sprinkler: yup
matlab...

Hi
Anyway...about that big honking program. the bug in it is that the collision detection only detects two sides of the triangle when checking for an intersection so the circle can be inside another triangle and it won't detect it.

Holy crap the bird is carrying the bear

If I were to set it to renew, would it charge full price or just the $1?
Is that SB's voice?

I just disconnected
When I go home this weekend I'll grab a second ethernet cord and one of our 360 mics.

Iusually avoid those stuff too lol

ohai MahBoi777
yeah, worst clopfic ever, p much.
Hate to see anything that destroys an image, even if it's a joke :S
Well.. not quite. at least it had proper grammar?
TheHoodyNinja: A condition of body and mind such as that which typically recurs for several hours every night, in which the nervous system is inactive,...
giant enemy crab!
Cupcakes was weak
Cupcakes was hilarious

/me will now speak like Zecora
I didn't even do anything!
Shane377 is crazy
Oh, it seems i dropped my hat, now, WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT!
I tried my hoof at fanfic writing. Couldn't come up with anything for the second chapter. The chapters afterwards I had an idea for what I was gonna include, but that damn second chapter was hard
blocks are common in any writing.
Seriously, is someone talking? Because I can't here them over the game
chat people probly can't hear story but i can kinda.
From the rooms and walls i see, this reminds me of the Great Deku tree
Eddmario: yes
I can hear mumbling in background
I've seen enough hentai to know where this is going...
game volume over-powering
Goodnight everyone
gnight Cobellanez
SuperBrony64: lower game volume increase chat volume
I just saw a rhyming witch, stealing my stuff, you little bitch

dem la las
/me cant stop laughing
indeed, game is still loud
the setting it does nothing.
wow SuperBrony64 its still loud setting does nothing
woo woo woo woo woo
actually I think it made it worse.
Oh X-box, you silly game, the volume is still the same
Man, there needs to be a FiM Maniazone for Trackmania, with MLP themed horns and car skins.
^
the settings do nothing!
put it to 3 or something lower i think that would be a good volume.
Lightning_Zephyr: its on 3
oh
ikr
the setting is useless. or counter-productive. Not sure.
SuperBrony64: If you wish to be quiet, that is your choice, but i cannot hear your manly voice
There are a LOT of voice clips that would make funny Horn sounds.
xbox game setting is worst setting
11,02I'm not talking at all though ._.
in game options volume Maybe?
no :(
SuperBrony64: whose talking then
You were a second ago
minute whatever

CHEESE
The only way to downgrade a 4.11 is to first figure out which ps3 you have, fat or slim, nand or nor chipset, then get a flasher e3 or progskeet and flash the chips. this is the only way to downgrade. any other way will not work or will brick your system.

inb4 pirates
not troll man
yar har fiddledy dee
Trololo
6most animations are done on 2s
DaringDude: You have some serious 1337 h4x because you know all this shit. You are a motherfucking wizard.
6as in, each single frame is held twice
Imma ninja, imma hoody ninja
XD
inb4 yeah
02yeah
6a single frame /is/ recognizable by the eye, but by doubling it, it is much more readable without much notice
wait
Daringdude I knwo it all too. I just dotn boast
TheHoodyNinja is best hooded ninja
6anime is notorious for 1s, which is why it's so smooth, but it's kind of uncanny at times
^
03that's just wasting filesize though, if it's the exact same frame, then just lower the framerate
03o.o
MahBoi777: yes I is
and yes, I did just use 1337 speak
imma shady im da real slim shady yes im the real slim shady
i second that MahBoi
xD
6I'm not too knowledgeable on the exact reason
captain planet
TheRealSlimShady: You just ruined that so bad
TheRealSlimShady: orly?
6but animating 24fps is advisable as opposed to 12
lol
6especially when scenes call for 1s
who was that?
6you can easily switch between 1s and 2s when animating in 24fps
inb4 nyan
/me shrugs
02well, you spend twice as much time on 1s vs 2s
Dung
the world may never know
Aw
/me nyans
nyanyanyanaynaaya
6in 12fps, you're essentially animating in 1s only
/me beats Shane377 with a bucket until he tells me who it was
02so it's worth the waste in file size
/me whistles nyan cat
great now I want a pop tart.
screw nyan naynaynaynayn

04Hello ladies and gents, I'll be your late night moderator for this evening and every evening from 4 AM to 7 AM unless otherwise stated.
03not sure if you like the song, but >masters
Hai Ghosties
dontlike
/me does not care
i have masters for some songs
Ghosties, 4am to 7 am what time?
03hm
04EST
03any idea how to have matlab find the determinant of a matrix?
03and/or the inverse of one?
bronystate time.. duh
no
04^
^^
03oh nvm
^^ sowwy
03it's inv(A)
03but determinant, hm.
so ill only get to see you when im sleep Ghosties?
03>> det(A)
03ans =
03-170
03wtf?
03>> help det
03det Determinant.
03det(X) is the determinant of the square matrix X.
03isn't it supposed to give me, like, an actual matrix?
04Anyhoo, if you guys spot any ne'er-do-wells causing trouble, don't be afraid to ping or PM me to let me know
04Probably panda :P
:'( but you are my second fav mod
ohai Ghosties
/me ponts randomly at ponies
04Aww, sorry panda
04Hey Phase
hey Ghosties do you ever stream?
http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Determinant.html
also
04No, but I would like to start eventually
where's the "how to rip RB topic?"
start tonight? :)
04Don't have the proper equipment :P
What would you stream if you began streaming?
what equipment do you need?
Like, films, games, youtube?
04VAC and some other do hickeys
fuck yea Ghosties time
04Anyways, I'd do a lot of horror stuff
Ghosties: so ur not streaming or are u?
04Since I'm a huge horror buff IRL
04Nope, sorry Shane
03http://www.stemshed.com/viewtopic.php?f=24&t=143
:'(
ur still one of my fav mods tho Ghosties
04But yeah, stuff like short films from YouTube (in particular the Dalton Fear Factory channel), creepypasta readings, Silent Hill novelizations, etc.
04And thanks, Shane :)
03oh, so determinant is just a scalar? k
04Ooh, one time I'd stream a marathon of Marble Hornets
04Wouldn't that be fun~
Hey Ghosties! Nice to see you like horror :$
never heard of marble hornets
04Thanks Maid
RoboGerbil: what about Slenderman?
04http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/MarbleHornets?from=Main.MarbleHornets
bope
nope
*yawn* good morning guys :)
04Marble Hornets is based off of the Slenderman mythos
i misread RB as JB

Ghosties, you are so random ^^
inb4 i'm cube
03well
03I kinda can't sleep right now
03too mad at myself
hey hey DeathStar how u going my sis
mad?
03yes
Shane377: goood
any specific reason?
DeathStar: wow i sense a hit of hostility
03I stupidly updated this PS3 to the newest firmware, and it's basically impossible to downgrade it without knowing how to solder and spending $60+ in tools >_>
I'd rather be Aurora
03and the newest firmware won't let me install homebrew
03so it's useless to me
it is partially my fault for being vague
oh I am, wish granted
04Random? Maybe :P
03well
Shane377: your sences must be blocked do you have a cold?
well
:P
03LL was considering buying this off me but, she'd have to sell her slim
you did say yourself the PS3 does nothing but be a dvd player right?
it doesn't need homebrew to do that
03yeah
03it needs homebrew to rip SACDs
03and play copied games
sorry
PS3 doesn't play games
xD
6lol.
03well
02drf, can it play PS2 games and does it have a CF card slot?
inb4 its a media center
03BlueFlare, both
03it's the first generation one
02Nice
03why, you interested?
02sorta
goood = hostile because too many o?
O__OOO
03I found a "demo mode" unit for $200
800 dollars
lol PS3
03which is apparently stupidly easy to get out of
lol game consoles
03by using a secret code
lol games
lol Diablo 3
03gotta love when people sell stuff and don't realize it's worth more
well
03look who's talking BlueFlare :P
it's not guaranteed to unlock
6D3 <3
03wait
unless you actually try it out
03why is it not guaranteed to unlock
drf
03?
like that person who sold a boxed copy of the NES?
What BlueFlare
i'm just considering the possibility
03LOL what
expecting like 10 dollars and instead got like 15 grand
XD
DeathStar: i actually do have the flu
O_o
03Nice
6I'm excited to finally play Diablo iii
02with the lol so and so think
03I would have paid him $10

04Thanks ^^
lol Ghosties
/me hugs Ghosties aswell
03no but seriously, my point being, I bought this first-gen PS3 so that I could rip SACDs and have the added benefit of playing pirated games, now I can't do either of those since I was an idiot x.x
6its 1:40 am
02drf, I'll buy your PS3 for $1 :)
03it still works fine, I can go on PSN and all that
03no

Ghosties: still h8 it wen ponies lick u

6so we're always here
04Waving is b(^_^)b okay
Ghosties: no offense but sound like a germaphobe
6but if you have the keys, there's no limit as to how long you can be there
04Because I probably am

nononono
6aren't you the one who was defending it to the point of calling drf some rather rude stuff today?
04Bah, Ghosties doesn't stream ponies
/me pokes panda s nose
04He streams horror >:D
she's having trouble afterupgrading her OS
Night panda
06i actually was being hones
horror ponies?
OSX isn't usually like that
04Night Panda
Hence the name.
I like horror!
06and im only honest, not hypocrite/fanboy
6ok so you were being honest about insulting people?
04I mean, it kinds fits, ya know
Om: x MaidSurge
04Ghosties
02OSX is fine, but apparently Aurora and Lion don’t mix
02XD
04Everfree Forest
6ugh, anyways, Lion's being a little sh*t to me
06facts, roara, facts
04Scary things
6I just barely got it and it's crashed my computer twice today
6facts?
04Makes sense in mah world
Can we giggle at you Ghosties?
dident you catch the *wink
04NO
Aurora & LU can you please drop it now?
04..................yes
MaidSurge: MAID TIME IS OVA
6but yeah this thing
6just
6why
6quicktime just froze again
04Oooooh, I could totally stream some Symphony of the Night
Ghosties: I don't think I want to live in your world it sound sceary
you know what i ment by ponies *wink right
Transfooooooooooorrrrrrmmmmm
04Because Castlevania is technically gothic and goth can be horror related :D
Ghosties: DeathStar i kno something thatll cheer u up and make u laugh
02okay, Lighty you don't own Apple XD
Ghosties: DeathStar http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJ1dYrjuYf4&feature=related
02So you should take everything that people say against them personally
02shouldn't*
06i DO own apple, silly :P
http://www.macworld.com/article/1161320/lion_quicktime7.html
Shane377: Blarghgh
iduno if this will help
BLARUGHUGHUGH
06and i dont take things against me or other personally, thats stupid
but i've mostly migrated to VLC/mplayer* on mac because loading mkv files is quicker
/me dances on Shane377 s feet for a change of pace
https://www.google.co.nz/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=how+to+quicktime+pro+lion
02quicktime is bad though. And I'm someone who likes a lot of Apple's stuff :P
04Nigel Thornberry is good...
Ghosties: as long as you don't stream stuff like Guinea Pig I can take horror :D
>MFW
04But this is better: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEdICVzB4qQ
DeathStar: ow my toes
06i had my experiences with Quicktime too, i mostly use a combination of Winamp, iTunes and library programs
06like, music library
6quicktime tends to be convienient for me with animation
Shane377: oh sorry I'll get off
Ghosties: this is BAWSS http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6c-Mr1Wwvg
/me dances on Shane377 s head
DeathStar: its fine just dont dance with heels on
6it's the only reason I ever use the program
sometimes QT is good, sometimes it's bad
Shane377: ok :)
Shane377: If I had a dollar for every pixle in that video, I would have one dollar
6Lion's setup with quicktime involves it keeping every video file open until you personally close it
lol Jim
02on Windows QT is always bad
6whereas before if I just closed the program, they'd all be closed
6now if I open quicktime, they're still there until I close them manually
6also, the snow leopard only ran one at a time normally
ive i had a a millon dollars for every time DeathStar danced i would be a millonaire
cmd-W?
6but yeah, with this stupid setup of opening quicktime with all the old videos on it
02guess I better goes to beds
6it crashed finder earlier
the typical user experience, expexially on slower computers with QT GUI, is bad
6which is rather...crucial.
/me yawns and floofs
Shane377: a multi millonare
(on windows)
SUKASI!
Wait, why am I surfing the Nigel part of youtube again?

Hey Meanwhile!
Oh hai
That's a lot of Nigel for 12 seconds.
DeadpoolDash: Well, the Secret Cow Level was a joke, and look what happened to that.

Needs more cowbell.
FInally my OC 2.0 IS DONE! Now I only need someone with artistic talent to draw it. http://s1075.photobucket.com/albums/w433/TheRandomkid321/?action=view&current=Screenshot2012-05-17at75507PM.png
oh my ponies

MFW Nigel was voiced by Tim Curry :O
o_o
TheRandomkid321: He looks sad.
Mother of cod.
Om Its supposed to be Anooyance/Boredom
04>yfw Tim Curry did Pennywise the Clown in Stephen King's IT
And now I cannot unsee Pennywise the Clown going BLAAARGH.
Yeah exactly.
Ghosties: Wait, really?
That film was funny.
04Mhm
FUCKING BUBBLES!
04Oh, Pennywise is /awesome/
That was good movie until the end.
/me hasn't seen It
/me wants to watch It
At first, I thought the secret pony level would anger a lot of people, but I haven't seen a lot of hate for it yet.
In what? :o
But then again, D3 was released 2 days ago.
044chan's pretty pissed about it
Guess you should start voting it for B movie XAX.
Ghosties: Well, 4chan's pissed about pretty much everything.
...diablo 3 had a secret pony level?
Is there anything in existence 4chan isn't pissed about at some point?
04But a lot of their anger is justified
Ghosties: Depends on the board.
04It's not just "Oh, 4chan is always pissed at something." Usually, they have a right to be pissed
I don't own Diablo 3 so I have no idea what you're on about.
wats 4 chan pissed about?
http://youtu.be/JeQzJC-vS40
04In Diablo 3 there's a secret pony level
04And 4chan is pissed about it
Secret pony level? :D
really?
Oic.
And why are they pissed about it?
But yeah, I can imagine /b/ being pissed about it. What with hating ponies and everything.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMV3IDMAKtU
4chan began the ponies anyway
^
why are they pissed about a level in a game? seriously, they need to get over themselves
Specifically, /co/ did.
>A lot of their anger is justified.
>Don't say why
I thought Hasbro started the ponies
Scumbag Ghosties. :P
This level looks pretty ferocious actually

08,01i was going to have breakfast like 1 and a half hours ago
Om I did. BEST ANME EVR!
Om, i heard about that
08,01but then i got distracted by stuff
No, I remembered parts of it, so I googled it and found the rest
08,01important stuff, jmind you
Oh, just spending a bit of time here, but I have to head out for finals today.
how come no one name "balls"
04I'm having ramen for breakfast
/me had poached eggs for breakfast.
08,01i'm probably going to have curry for breakfast
TheRainbowDash: OH geez, good luck on those :O
im having burger for lunch
lucky, Ghosties >:I
i'm going to reboot, bbl
oh wow
Reboot!
If I had a kid The onyl sutable name would be "Brokencondom"
Ghosties: K-DST all the way
RaveBrony: Yeah, hope for the best of luck for me.
08,01Phase4: has reboots for breakfast
04I'd love to have something like scrambled eggs, sausage, pancakes, grits, biscuits for breakfast, but alas it is not so v_v
TheRainbowDash: I will :P
Dot Matrix for breakfast.
It would have been nice to have a less common name. Oh well. Now I am hungry!
If you know what I mean.
Ghosties: Why you get so much noms
?
and with that i actualy reboot, bbk
bbl'
I would cook some for you, Ghosties.
Ghosties: Why cant you have that? lol
04No, I mean, I'd love to have that kind of food for breakfast but I has none ;_;
Oh :(
Ghosties: Oh, well, too bad for you.:D
that moment when the fridge is empty
I know that feel
reboot, take two
No, I mean I would get that food for you and cook it, Ghosties
Or to be more precise, the fridge is full, but there's nothing to eat
First World Problems
Indeed.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&feature=endscreen&list=FLCrJ6Rah3q2YaUhrS9gWLcg&v=wHwyca7gu7E
Jim: I love those pics :D
Smoke weed erryday.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JEyJISeM7I&feature=related
Or that feel when you open the fridge and there is nothing but toppings and condements
/me has never smoked weed and does not condone it's use.
^
My little disclaimer.
08,01Ghosties: i'd say go buy some, but i don't want to patronise your lifestyle choices
Some weed everyday.
08,01y'know, being an English major, n'all
/me 08,01runs
yay, rebooted
THese 'weed' are making me laugh my flank off :D
Phase4: Grooovy.
*Weed vids'
Phase4: Reboots. Why must you do them so frequently?
Because you touch yourself at night
XAX, because windows for games (at least untill a few plans of mine start to work) and linux for everything else, and some games
Phase4: good luck with these plans ._.
Jim: Only at night?
what to play... what to play...
Minecraft?
Phase4: That's it! I've got it! There's really just one way to find out which game is the BEST!
/me loves tornadoes
Rain: I wub, well.....not destructive types of weather.
Kammerjunk: Make them run an obstical course?
I enjoy standing outside during tornadoes~
You've got it!
Kammerjunk, hold a contest, of speed, agility and guts!
I wish there were more thunderstorms around here :I
I like rain, but I don't like being in the rain.
Oh god, not this again....(covers ears):D
I love walking in the rain~
Raindrops keep falling on my head.
Rain in the rain. Rainception.
:p
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red. Cryin's not for me.
its been raining 3 days in a row here
What if Rain is just rain that learned to type?
My room is freezing. I dont think my fan and A/C are helping much aswell -_-
Om, you shut your mouth!
One thing I don't like about rain is how hard it is pulling arrows out of a target in the rain.
tf2 or trackmania....
Seriously, those bastards are slippery.
/me runs away yelling "No one must know!"
or choice c, audiosurf...
Rain: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4305/
Phase4: I'll chose audiosurd, it is cool.
(audiosurf)
audiosurf it is
Lol, Om
WHy does my saliva smell like pau pau crem?
tf2 is best pony
Wait, my decision is the only decision? Ok.:D
Phase4: Stream TF2 some time, so I can backstab you and bronystate can laug-- what?
Lol!!
I like TF2.
TF2 is fun.
^
TheRainbowDash: Why are you smelling your saliva?
Wait, what the hay?
Well, why not!
XAX, hmmmm
Phase4: audiosurF/?
[WUB]JRP2234, audiosurf
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4630/
TheRandomkid321: Depends on what cat.
Phase4: inb4 you spycheck EVERYTHING :(
Because 'cat' makes me think of Schrödinger's Cat.
chat* I knew taht spelling mistake would come back to as r@pe me
XAX, spycheck the cart
Oh.
/me throws Phase4 a game
04He's always here
04Always
Ghosties, english major is better than my major
Legitimately lol'd, phase4.
/me throws video equipment at Ghosties
^ why? :o
O_o
Confidence? http://buttersafe.com/2007/07/19/confidence/
to capture a ghost on film
I'm not a major. I'm not even in the army.
^ O U.
Om: I lost
Jim: Are you saying you lost the game?
Yep
...so did i
-_-
Everyone has lost the game, thereis no winner to it
^
04Yes, TheRainbowDash
o_o....I got to run.
I lost the Game before it was cool.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScCgxuId98
>_>
I only like the meme ironically, really.
Oh noe
Well, that isn't too bad.
always watching...like ceiling Derpy
lets compair college majors, shall we? :3
/me is 15, and what is this?
/me was talking to the big ponies
Am... AM I high right now? http://cheezburger.com/6207166720?siteId=136#comments
Dude, woah.
Lol??
Ive never been high, so i wudnt know :D
^
I don't even smoke.
I just don't know what went wrong
Same
you dont need to smoke to get high
Nice pic tho :P
I meant cigarettes.
/me 's favorite high is Runner's High~
I'm high on friendship
^
audiosurf realy isnt doing it for me tonight :(
u can get high of morphine
duh
Im high on life.... people always say im high, when im not :D
you can also get high off of running
Phase4: Oh, well....hmm, try Team Fortress 2 then.
https://images.4channel.org/f/src/SDT%20V1.92%20-%20New%20Features.swf any idea what this is and who made it?
I had strong pain meds once, I know they workd because I don't remember them at all.
haha
TheRainbowDash, it seems, yeah
But I know drugs aren't the only way to get high. For example, if you have a radio on white noise, cut a tennis ball in half, tape each half over your eyes and finally beam infa-red light through the halved ball, you can get high.
I got that when I was getting my ankle surgery
Phase4: Might as well try all of the options tat you have, before they all run out, I guess.
(that)
/me attacks TheRainbowDash ............................... with glomps
Kammerjunk that is just sensory over kill
o_o.......
I remember after I has my tonsils out, I was pressing the morphine button every time the limited that stopped me spamming it turned off
Yea, I broke my arm. Got imediate surgery.
hello everypony
has anyone seen AttackWithHugs recently?
Rain: More or less same effect, though, at least to the unexperienced.
hi yifle1
Got up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom
Couldnt tell if standing up, or floating
Oh shoot!! Ive got to go everypony!! Cya later and take care!!
:P
Hello yifle1! (waves and hugs) And bye RaveBrony!
TheRainbowDash: wuts wrong dont like me anymore FINE!

;)
Shane377: I always liked you, silly.:)
bye RaveBrony
later RaveBrony
Rain: Explain the feel
https://images.4channel.org/f/src/SDT%20V1.92%20-%20New%20Features.swf anyone?
/me throws TheRainbowDash ......... into a pit of hugs
l8r RaveBrony
Shane377: Ah, not the pit of hugs! Ahhhh!:D

Bai RaveBrony :(
yifle1: nah

Like you are the happiest person alive
Only anestetic I've ever had is laughing gas. Was pretty young, though, so felt like my legs were spinning around me.
Rain: Then no, never felt that before.
run 7-10 miles without stop and you will
Kammerjunk: Like a record baby
o u
lol :D
Rain: If I run that far without stopping I would be more concernd how comfortable the pavement would be.
Happiest person ever? I feel like that anyway.
http://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/4/20/KlYZsL4aPESEupIKbc7a6w2.jpg YEah im starting to post random pics but I fidn em funny
yifle1: i can tell nigel cheered u up
Raindrops keep falling on my head. And just like that guy whose feet are too big for his head, nothing seems to fit.
Gabe Newell with a chaingun. Your argument is invalid.
http://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/2012/3/23/a150f234-6690-4880-9d07-dd3c94bb1217.jpg
Shane377 yes he did XD
hmmm, tf2 seems to have broken
Kammerjunk, enorphins are natural feel good chemicals :3
Kammerjunk: Those rain drops keep falling on my head; they keep falling.
haha success
So I just did me some talkin' to the Sun.
Shane377 thanks for that XD
Phase4: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4694/
Rain: I haven't had anethetic since I became a brony. I want to try that.
Also, runner's high is the healthiest way to get high
Might as well be walkin' on the sun.
~don't worry be hppy now~
http://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/2012/3/23/b3d9b555-9b10-4836-962f-89ff5c47434c.jpg

OMG Metroid 2. <3 one of my favourite GB games
08,01so this is the first time i've played pokemon
08,01ever
there we go
Really?
08,01except for a few minutes last night
Good luck then
08,01xmasskills: totally the truth
Oh the nostalgia :D
08,01Kandarihu: yup
I never played pokemon in my life
THE song!
/me has red and blue andbc :3 a g

red version ftw
08,01xmasskills: completely true; i don't play computer games really
I still have my pokemon blue somewhere
and a gbc :3'
and a gbc, yes
the music sounded slightly unstable
Oh. Visual Boy Advance doesn't work very well on Linux
Derpy_Ctrax: It's an emulator :P
i've got one copy of red and due to fortunate circumstances, two copies of blue
For Gameboy, which was the first 32 Bit sound system
I know, Vordox. This is no excuse.
08,01xmasskills: and a gameboy is a comptuer...
32 BIT system sound...
Vordox, nope, 8bit sound
It sounds like something is dying.
Phase4: Brb, getting facts. :P
it's a gameboy emulator, a modern pc should be able to handle it
YEAH IT IS!
AAA

derpy_pony, gameboy emulator written in javascript
no no no oh good
Shizuka is best Gary
oh wow
08,01balls, i broke it
i thought it was gonna be Sh!tface or something
hehe... i love how the professor doesn't even remember his grandson's name^^
what happened?
08,01this javascript emulator is a bit flakey
Jim: false gary has a sister that lives in the town
javascript is no good for emulators
08,01Phase4: there's a pentium emulator in JS
i've seen that one too
slow as balls
Phase4: Sound: 2 square wave generators, 1 PCM 4-bit wave sample (64 4-bit samples played in 1x64 bank or 2x32 bank) channel, 1 noise generator, and one audio input from the cartridge.[33] The unit only has one speaker, but headphones provide stereo sound (for further information, see Game Boy music) Ah shoot D:
He could stream Ponyta
and IM BACK
Vordox, ah, so its mostly 4 bit soudn
It was 32 channels.
Welcome back TheRainbowDash2.
Not 32 bit, derp
sound is going crazy sometimes
back to buisness
hits xmasskills with a spoon
Shane377: well im out bye bro bro

Bye xmasskills.
/me gives xmasskills a banana muffin
I havent played original pokemon in so long...wonder where I put that game
hits xmasskills with a spoon one last time
Spike is best Gary
i had and lost copies of yellow gold and silver
8-bit musics for the win.
wish i didnt loose them, gold and silver were great fun
There's a reason people try to avoid using JS. :P
Does this have a save feature?
:D
I lost my gold version, but I still have blue and yellow
pokemon!
oh, and silver
This music...memories...
pokemon silver was best pokemon
indeed it was
08,01sure
Phase4: Agreed, before they removed the best things for RUby and Sapphire
I love the first generation
imho, it goes Silver > Emerald > Yellow > everything else
its lagging bad on my end
yellow and emerald are actualy about equal
08,01nope
08,01i'm playing pokemon
dat 8-bit music
Phase4: Mine is Silver, White, rest.
/me loved his pikachu
I remember you can take advantage of a glitch in original red & blue and get a mew - when you get to the town after mt moon - around the gold bridge...look it up
Vordox, well i havent played white or black
Cypresswolf, i did that, twice
Phase4: You're missing OUT then. It's the second best yet.
:O Pokemon stream!
Cypresswolf, you can actualy do it as soon as you get to... the one with the water gym
im out see ya tommorow
cerulean

Phase4: Day night, Events, catching, Effects, animated sprites, YOU NAME It, even ONLINE Present/Gifts/Adventure if you have WIFI
08,01Kandarihu: horrible how?
Cypresswolf, but yeah, mew glitch works
Omg

I'm not watching :(
XAX, red
:o
I got the cartridge in my draw
Spike :D
All 151 caught :3
its broke here
Did you set the text to go slowly?
So when does Pokemon Rainbow come out?
08,01because it made a noise!
XAX, you sir have more swag than i
They all make noises
Take him!!!
NOOO BLASTOISE!
Too bad there's no AA batteries in the room. Wanna see if my save still works...
this music is making me sleepy
Yesh!
bulbasaur
:) I had a friend tell me in Jr high that to get a mew in the game, you had to first beat the game, elite four, the start at the beginning and walk EVERY space in the game & hit A on each space, and on the last space - Mew would appear
Chose Professer Oak!
Yesh!!
OH LOOK
XAX:The battery lasts for 15 years... :P In the game tha tis
Cypresswolf, you allso have to use strength on the truck
A WEIRDLY DESIGNED SUPER GAMEBOY FOR THE SNES
AAAAAAA
:D I never did find out if that worked for him
You know what would be awesome guys...?
: D
what, Vordox ?
lol, no numbers
A SINGLE console to PLAY ALL GAMES ever made of the current generations...
Technically that means the battery in the cartridge should have run out by now...
OH SHI--
Current and past
Spike? He does not have the rights to have that name!
08,01i have no idea what i'm doing!
YAY!
04Well everybody, I can't possibly stave off sleep any longer. Have a good day everybody :)
08,01how'd i not hurt him?
Cya Ghosties
later Ghosties
Vordox: We have emulators for the PC for that. :P
Use Tackle!
/me hugs Ghosties
just keep scratching!!!!
Sleep well n shit, Ghosties.
Spell-of-Gaming: NO! CONSOLE > PC
Ghosties: that's when coffee is your best friend :)
/me growls Squirtle
08,01i have no idea if i'm winning
at'
Vordox: LEAVE, AND NEVER RETURN
04Hehe, later
You see that life bar next to his name?
his bar has to be lower than your bar
#define BUCKS_GIVEN_BUFFER
The only official way to get a Mew was supposed to be at an event coordinated between Nintendo and any 501c3 tax exempt organization.
XAX: NEVAH! Console games SHOULD BE ON CONSOLE games!
ah, the old growl/tail whip loop
Critical HIT!
ohai Drake
08,01yay i one!
08,01*won
08,01oh, okay, lemme see fi i can fix that
Confound bronystate. It drives me to get out of bed, go down the hallway, get 4 AA batteries from the remotes in the lounge, and see if my save file in Red still works.
brb
08,01hoshould be a bit better now
I never understood why you 'black out' after losing your last pokemon in a battle - is losing that much of a shock
08,01Phase4: nah, it's x11grab
Phase4: Oh yeah they had 44100 on the GB?
ah, k
Ev'ryday i'm buffering!
Cypresswolf: yes
Vordox, nope
Ohai
Cause that would be awesome XD
thats better
though lagging a bit
Cypresswolf: apparently
It's better
its broken here, let me refresh
dat buffer
its lagging
XAX: Just checked my blue version, mine is still working fine
08,01the hell?
08,01RANDOM ENCOUNTER!
Kandarihu: Same problem as Harry Potter :I They've said that it uses black magic, when it's all about teamwork and stuff I'm too lazy to list
its lagging here, i'm not seing anything but the times where you bump into things
sup guys i'm back :)
hi F22skyhunter
ohai F22skyhunter
love the music
expertly crafted
Jim: I got out of bed, but then it was cold, so I got back into bed.
YOU KILLED AN ANIMAL! Murderer!
http://gyazo.com/b738a7ed7883a04943dfa6aa500a2730 what do you think guys? i drew it couple minutes ago :)
:(
Well, it certainly doesn't help that Mew is a Psychic type... AND G1 was infamous for Psychic types being overpowered. They were nerfed in G2.
i have a lvl 100 pokemon on platinum
Katamari Damaci!!!
the audio is still not right
that looks sweet F22skyhunter
ofna01: Only one?
F22skyhunter: Too much RD :P
08,01ANOTHER RANDOM ENCOUNTER!
my pkachu is lvl 75
F22skyhunter: But damn nice..:Sned it to EQD
sync is better though, seems to be just a latency instead of broke drifting out of sync
F22skyhunter: eyes can use some work, but otherwise, that's really nice.
Phase4: the sync is still way off.
F22skyhunter: Awesome
F22,thats AWESOME
Kandarihu, try refresh your stream
the golbat sprites freaks me out
It's not outsunched me, The effects AND the text and sounds are in sync now to me
I'm still waiting for a pokemon game where that have all the regions included! :) Imagine - a pokemon game that takes just as long as going through everything in Skyrim
yifle1: Oh god yes
08,01[WUB]JRP2234: what?
eww
you watch?
Cypresswolf, I WANT
08,01OH FFS ANOTHER RANDOM ENCOUNTER
golbat looks so creppy
you can flee from them you know
240 hours in 1st skyrim game and still not done
F22skyhunter pretty f***ing good. is it inspired by a fanfic?
Cypresswolf, thats what gold and silver allmost were, if they had the orange isles and a little bit more to actualy do in kanto it would have been epic
hey cypress, diamond and pearl let you explore the regions of the previous games after you defeat the elite 4
Cypresswolf: ...Errr... I had around 320 Hours in my first POke game...FIRST pokegame...
Oh lawd
Mutterguy: nope i just wanted to draw steampunk dash :)
its lagging
paused stream,too laggy
Cypresswolf: I wish it can be on the Wii U, AMAZING 3D! Problem is, the Wii U is probably gonna cost like $400 :I
Spell-of-Gaming: That's...not much
Who has seen the animated trailer for the new pokemon games?
First pokemon game is always the longest - It took me forever to get through the part with the ship
Me gusta.
08,01[WUB]JRP2234: i'm playing pokemon
Spell-of-Gaming, pokemon MMO? i could see it
Kandarihu: thanks about the feedback i fixed the eyes. :)
i needs lulz
O_O New Pokemon Games?
Cypresswolf: Black and White 2
Alright. Well, I'll be back later. I suggest you grab the latest VBA or VBA-M from repository, and find a good torrent for GoodGBx.
WHAT
/me yawns
There was an anime trailer made for it
Mutterguy: there are online pokemon battle sites. google them
/me sneezes
:O 2? *looks it up*
:megusta:
more pokemon games
Which youtube video title does the BLack and White trailer 2 have?
I find NOTHING animated.
CrazyCherry: Gesundheit
B & W 2 are the 3rd entry in gen 5...what was the 2nd?
08,01A QUEST
RoboGerbil: Problem is that sometimes you can cheat level up instantly by battling yourself. Yeah, it's a paradox. :I
Twi_Fi: Thanks. :)
Spell-of-Gaming: the ones i saw let you auto put all your pokemon at 100, and let yuo select your skills and stuff
I have Pokemons that are like, Lvl. 300 on an online Pokemon battle site :I
anyone have a working pokemon white rom?
its lagging like hell
For those who havnt seen the black and white 2 animated trailer, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBdp_dLEdqU
08,01Mutterguy: railroaded?
Wait, there's a stream... OH SHI-
RPG term... you can't do anything beyond the thinly veiled plot outline... actually kinda silly seeing as pokemon can't support anythnig more than that....
XAX: there sure is.
an open world pokemon game would definately be awesome
time to go to work i suppose...
I love how most games have that invisible barrier - Elder Scrolls Oblivion at least gave you a message when you hit it
Ingwaz: Cya
Ingwaz: Have fun!
oblivion gave a message when you hit the barrier? i thought the water would just stop you, and everywhere else was mountains
1. Make original ideas for a Pokemon MMO. 2. Advertise it on YouTube. 3. ??? 4. IT PRINTS MONEY
All this pokemon talk makes me want to go and find where I was up to in the manga
The manga is good...
There were places where there were just plains or even at one point a mountain path, IIRC, where if you tried to go too far, you hit an invisible wall and the game told you you were at the end of the playable world.
The message - "You cannont go that way, turn back"
XAX: Manga is ok...
I read some of the manga
Pokemon manga > Pokemon anime
Definetly
There's actually violence
The anime was horrible
*currently watching the anime on Cartoon Network, mostly 'cause nothing else is on at this time in the morning*
:) I want a mod where a voice comes that sounds like Bob from Reboot "I can't let you do that, User"
I only like some of the episode becasue of James and Brock.
http://objection.mrdictionary.net/go.php?n=5771646
that plays everytime you hit that boundary line
Brock isn't in the show anymore, either :(
dat forrest
Poke'mon is so...different.
08,01I CAUGHT ONE!
Sylandest: Just let him play.
08,01WOOOOOOOO
OtakuTom: Brock was the asian right?
WOOOOO
lol, dat metapod
:) Oh that Metapod
lol why would you want a metapod?
Just let him play xD
lol metapod
Brock was the first gym leader...the one that was obsessed with trying to get a date.
08,01oh nice, i fullscreened it
who didn't name those after something dirty
RoboGerbil, nope, magicarp is worse
metapod evolves earlier
How do you train a Magicarp
Magicarp :D
And I remember Green's charmeleon cutting an arbok in half
SoapyBrony, send it out and switch to another pokemon'
Ah
lolz
preferably against something high level
I'm excited for Version 2 of Black and White.
SoapyBrony: or get exp share
Yeah
Nickname a Magicarp as "Magicrap"
Makes sense to me
OtakuTom: The animated trailer for those game. :megusta:
see ya all later
SoapyBrony, or do what i did, catch a level 40 magicarp, and have it struggle things to death
08,01looool
08,01metapod
Magicarp are the biggest trolls - pain in the flank to raise, can't attack anything, but then it evolves into a dragon
LOL
SoapyBrony, it made a baws garydose
Cypresswolf: Pokemon Logic. :I
Phase4: >garydose
IT'S SUPER EFFECTIVE!
SoapyBrony: also use an object to share experience with the fighting mon :D
XAX, i cant spell :(
METAPOD! NO!!!!!!
ded
is not big suprise
Gee metapod fainted? How!?
I just pictured a Gyarados with Gary oaks head. Thanks Phase4.
XD
wow only 4 stats?
Which version of pokemon is this?
:) Top 10 disturbing pokedex entries - http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/03/15/weirdest-pokemon-black-white/
Welsh_Pony: pokemon red
08,01HAHAHA IT WAS SUPER EFFECTIVE
yeah special defense and attack were split in gold and sillver
In the manga, Gary(green) is a level headed guy. In the anime he is a total jerk off >)
>_>
Yep, bugs are weak to fire.
MaidSurge, is right, if you go through the forest now ya likely to faint

Phase18: lolz. Dafuq just happened?
My thoughts exactly.
Wait you're ACTUALLY using a ZUBAT?
Litwick: And why not? They arent a bad pokemon?
Screw needing siblings...I had friends that had each the versions (as well as myself), and on top of that, I just have multiple versions of the systems and a copy of each game :P
Om: In Gen 2 onwards they weren't.
Cuz they got fucking CROBAT.
/me hugs litwick
The crap I find on youtube.
Ikr.
Crobat are pretty baws.
Zubat sucked health from Zubat.
Get to the name rater and named it Meanwhile.
Why do I have to be Zubat? ;n;
Meanwhile because I don't want to be a crappy Pokemon.
I'll be anything as long as it isn't Zubat.
Litwick: Its his first run.

Bye Wrek.
Cya Wrek
/me pokes
Byyeee
cya Wrek
/me 's radio turns off
dat drawing\
so what is he explaining here?
Why are you listening to the radio?
/me prods.
Education
he learns me well:P
/me punches
U be dun gud
Phew
gots meself a edumacution
Im a robot, theres a radio built onto me
the model was made by discord
/me resists her inner Grammar Nazi
it was a silly thing someone made one movie night during a boring movie
vas is das
mfw I missed the underwater whatnot :<
Es mterz LunaTheBeloved? Havin tubls?
hmm samurai champloo
Meh.
I thought we turned you into a radio during Organ Trail
Hip hop samurai. Because nothing undermines the point of a samurai like hip hop.
I hate pop culture sometimes.
Starflash, I missed it too :(
Well, it wasn't meant to be realistic, or historically accurate.
wait... what?
I must have missed it too.
although you probably seen it 10 times already :D
/me owns it
But yeah....effing brother running out of gas
As if that might somehow change my initial impression of it.
Its still a good anime.
uhm
I had to go take him some
smart :D
im sorry to say ive never seen
I was so pissed off
You have no idea
Luna, I think thats what it was
same here brony_swan
Not too supprised.
was it an original jap. show
Organ Trail is always amusing.
08,01Kandarihu: it's not meant to be history; it's a discussion abotu education
Yeah...
I was sleepy due to the boring movie so I dont remember that well XD
Wasn't it that extremely boring movie Val picked?
yeah
that will be two bits
what?
This is the english dubed version if that is what you mean brony_swan
I'm calling shotgun for the next time we play.
yea
You can't do that.
some promise
Shotgun rules say, that you have to at least be headed to the car to call it
I am headed, just real slowly.
its just that they dont move their mouth to the words very well
its...od
Its like me saying, "Hey, when we drive to Florida next month, I call shotgun"
Some kinda ogre.
At the very least you have to already be outside to call shotgun
What a horrible Story Mark
those eyesO_O
derp
lol
There are rules to Shotgun Calling
he is best samurai
I know
oh noes mah dumplins
Best episode in my opinion is the baseball episode.
08,01Om: yup
OooooOOOOoo
I remember someone sent me a fully 5 pages of the full rules sometime XD
baseball samurai Om?
x3
alexxm: Halarity ensuse
extremely boring movie Val picked? Which one do you mean, LunaTheBeloved?
SOMETIMES I DREAM ABOUT CHEESE
The Fountain.
i keep getting shivers when i walk down my hallwau
^

I thought it was...
And rules are irrelevant, I'll still win shotgun.

i think its haunted :(
...interesting

ofna01: Walk down it on your hands.
It was soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo boring

To be fair, this quote is from people making fun of such behavior XD
I've never even been to 4chan
Woof
I like parts of 4chan
I did once.
I regret it.
But yeah, I'm suprised no one's used PrincessLuna as a nick before
ofna01: Yes you will. No go mop something.
NO
Or at least has it registered

No it dosen't.
Because raid night.
/a/- anime and manga
/v/- vidya gaems
/b/- random
Ah okay
most of 4chan's reputation comes from /b/
o_O
One does not simply ignore raid night.
Yays :3 and now, 4Chanology by Sweetiebot~
But on the bright side, no raids during the best movies this week.
and /a/ and /v/ are like mini versions of /b/ due to having so many people on them

08,01don't worry, there's a recap at the beginning
08,01i think
I don't think I've seen Lexx

:O Lexx!!!
A wise lesson.
/me has a tiretrack going across her belly
Oo
08,01basically, they are all on this massive ship that's alive
Why does the intro sound like the final boss theme of Twilight Princess?
The hell is that.
08,01and they stole
08,01and then it gets weird
I've seen Lexx. I somewhat regret it.
Sounds like a porno
Get a bath or something ~
08,01PrincessLuna: it kinda is
I just thought of something...
video is lagging, some
08,01but not really
We should have a Princess Hour

Welp, Diablo 3 has a secret level full of happiness and rainbows where you kill ponies that have MLP reference names
08,01yup

Om: It's not suspense if there's no danger. ;)

You need to sort out that twitchy eye GilDash.
GilDash: So you admit you're dangerous.

I'm not sure
I can't put my finger on it but I can't tell where this movie is going
Invi: Aww, you should come join us one night. We'll be gentle. :)

Also, you should have seen #Twilight_Sparkle before #bronystate was closed on live airings. Oh, the discussions we had.
I just noticed :)
Invi, ever heard of Relentless? I enjoy few liters of that every day.
twilight sparkle is best chatroom

Y'know, I recently had an epiphany
1%= Homebrew!

O.o
Scootaloo isn't actually my favourite pony.
In fact she's nowhere near my favourite pony
o rly?
for a bunch of brains they're pretty smug
I mean, I like her, but she's not even in my top five.
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4107/
best pony is twilight sparkle, all know this
03yeah basically
03and maybe Brawl
Do not want.
03not MK Wii, that's terrible too
03:|
Pony: Shhh, I'm saving that one. :|
BOOO
ScootaBlues: so? who's in dat top 5?
Om: That's a shame. :)
ScootaBlues: How about Blues/Noteworthy?
thats going to be some wicked rope burn
ScootaBlues: just because its not your favorite pony doesnt mean you cant use it as a name
GilDash: What do you base that opinion off of?
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1526/
Pinkie Pie is my favorite pony
RX-78-SweetieBot: Yeah, plus I've grown used to it after having used it for so long.
Om: Many, many things, Ommykins. :)

03oh
MaidSurge: Cocain Pony is best pony ^_^
03that awkward moment when PS2 still has better graphics than Wii
GilDash, yeah sure, but do you understand it?
cocaine*
GilDash: I don't pretend...Much.
DAT MUSIC
that's the weirdest joystick ever
Pony I don't understand the amazingness of this food utility.
Added widescreen support, more colours, motion controls that sucked
and yeah
Om: That'll do. :)
pretty much, maybe
:P
Pony: One does not simply understand pizza.
03PS2 has widescreen.
Don't call her Cocaine Pony, she's not a junkie :D
03just not natively
03it's per-game
Um, What are we watching?
GC is just as good as Wii
What? I speak fluent pizza.
GilDash indeed
03some games like God of War have it + 480p
03and yeah
Magical_pablez94: 1. Rarity 2. Octavia 3. Pinkie/Twilight 4. Luna 5. Shining Amor (because of dat voice)
03Wii is just a wireless gamecube after all
Well of course pinkie pie doesnt do drugs
03>Nintendo
03>Using crappy hardware
Also bear in mind this changes like every five minutes.
also
well hey
/me ughs LunaTheBeloved

03more like 20
Yet N64, GC and SNES were all #1 or #2
MaidSurge, don't ever speak about Italians when I'm around
03GameCube was a bit "eh"
does someone here know the art of schwenken?
did anything that the ship looks sort of like...well
03decent system but the controller is funky and most of the games sucked
Pony: What's wrong with Italians? :S
Pony: why? :(
Some games looked pretty decent
Hard to find really good GC games
But
ScootaBlues: 1. Luna 2. Applejack 3.Scootaloo 4.Rainbow Dash 5.Vinyl Scratch
Star Wars Rouge Squadron 2 FTSW
03well
-S
03GameCube TECHNICALLY had better graphics than PS2
03but nobody used them
03LOL
MaidSurge, ever tried to live with an Italian couple?
That game was from 2001
03even Wii games are about the same >>
What is the best music player software

Ah, he finaly fixed his girlfrend
I can still hate the 3DS, me buying it doesn't mean anything
WallDives, the thin line, like between Genius&Insane, Pleasure&Pain, I know, but pretty much same thing, really.
Pony: Pleasure and pain... ;)
03hating the 3DS, that's the spirit
oh those south eu internet connections...
And if it does, then lol I hate the Wii too and we got it anyway?
03that's a known piracy server too
Right, there we go.
oh, so lexx is the space ship?

I approve of that
Wii, terrible game selection for me
Skynet has the stream!
What did i walk into
I like my GV
The BronyStateRegulars skype room is so amazingly depraved
03Wii is just a fancy GameCube
GC
and 3DS
is a waste of money
lol
That video is amazing!
besides I have come to a conclusion that italians are worse wine facists than french
Here we go everypony
14oh well, if you have a GC I can't blame you x3
Just to get 3D and WiFi and apps and stuff
LAWL
14most of my games are GC ones
14:D
It's what happen when you take people in a fairly strictly regulated chat room and put them in a place with no rules whatsoever.
I DONT NEED THAT STUFF
:D
Had to refresh chat. Anything happen?
03LOL apps
14you can play 3DS games without 3D

Big freaking deal.

Hey... anyone seen TheRainbowDash?
14you can play DS games on a 3DS

except when it comes to sharing, naturally italians hate spanish wine, but when you ask to have the bottle they accidentally bought, you cant have it, because they think I drink too much.
hmmmm.....
03inb4 taking suggestive 3D photos
I would love to go to Italy
inb4 you only use bold
03makes it worth the while
03I mean

Well, this is riveting
03<Viri> you can play DS games on a 3DS <- they look like complete crap, too
so nothing is lost
Viri

hmm, audio is quite behind
Retro gamers exist
Some look like crap

so ya, thought ya, might like to...go to the show?
 haha
14did you lose your savefile? o.o
and can be replaced as much as you want
I'm perfectly clean!
GilDash: I'm sure there are plenty of creative ways to do that XD
No.
to feel the warmth we love confusion and space cadet glow
14o.O
...oh and again.... "Shaddaappa" "no, voi shaddaapa"
Well, I've got some bad news for you, Sunshine.
14weird

I wish he would make me a mod again....that was so much fun
well thats in the flesh. I was thinking in the flesh?
That's the other version.

Om: Do you really want to chance that? ;)

MahBoi777: may be i would say accomodate you. *embarasment grin*
There's a stream, Pony
Replace the batteries, derp

GilDash: *sigh* No...
I actually like the movie versions of the songs more than the original studio version
Magical_pablez94: lol, that'd be nice
I think next time a position opens up I'll apply for Modship
14I replaced them xD
really? *refresh* ... that counts?
it does.
14I guess because of too much time without it?
Every day I'm PonySwagg.
Om: You know, I don't mind. It's not any hassel...
MahBoi777: ^^
allo everyone
Cello Dken2021
hi Dken2021
hey Dken2021!
hi Dken2021.
Of course. The Wall isnt' even the best Pink Floyd album
TheMaster: It differs for me. For example, I like What Shall We Do Now, but that's not in the album version IIRC.
Dken2021: Holla! :)
TheMaster: DSotM?
LTB being a mod? That sounds scary

I really like The Trial.

/me shrugs
14since the savefile would reset if you don't play it for 50 minutes
%Co
beep boop

14the second one was fine though
RX-78-SweetieBot: I think there's a script that can deal with that
damn I just hit hard by nostalgia just now
Okay
Bah, computers can't do anything random.
randomly*
2,6What happens if you swap them round...?
you could program it to do things randomly
7,11Dont really care that much
XD
:3
6,2Fair do's
wonder what this does
Yeah, but it can't actually do it completely randomly.
GilDash, should I stop complaining? I should stop complaining.
not sure what ctrl+o does for mirc
08,01Kammerjunk: it can if it get random input as the seed
08,01for example, a quantum event
Lol jokes

You people and your colours
Om, sometimes, I need to get it out from my system. It doesn't help I'm supposed to go out with an Italian this weekend.
:3
12,2:3
Magical_pablez94: What's racist?
*cough* Lucky *cough*
08,01i forgot the "intermission" on the end
Pony: then you're going out with the wrong person,
1,12:P
I see the stream is safe and happy
You will never understand!
hmm
Pony: You only live so long, enjoy it even if it kills you. Of course you can still complain. Because its fun to complain.
GilDash: GilDy!!
the intermission lies.
You're right I won't
as always
I dunno how
GAH! THE BRIGHTNESS!!!

Wrek
WallDives, nah, she's nice. Italian. But still nice.
/me glomps GilDash
Om, EXACTLY
oh wreks
White balls?
Pony: then the fact she's Italian shouldnt matter.
the little preview thing shows them a bit differnt
behind the colorful screen and smooth jazz is pure chaos
Kammerjunk: who is? guess. a tip? i'm ita
pffffffft
its annoying
don't let it fool you
WallDives, it does, because it's fucken hilarious when she gets mad
I'm sorry, but I detest racism and discrimination, having gone through it myself.
CrazyCherry: I belive GilDash steped out to do something.
and now I must go for a bit
Magical_pablez94: I don't follow.
Bye SweetieBot
otherwise, I wouldnt care.

Hm?
Can't see the text...
MahBoi777: hey
hey Pinkies4thWall!
Magical_pablez94: Oh, you meant Pony. I was just kind of skipping their messages, it was completely irrelevant to me and directed towards a few select people who had been following the chat for a while.
CrazyCherry:some one is bad talking about italians...
Pinkies4thWall: You been working today?
the screen lies!
CrazyCherry: no
ALL LIEZ
I still wish people in here would read the actual rules.

Wb
i know... i'm italian, CrazyCherry
03dunno if I should nap or just stay up
MahBoi777: you heard my voice last night, no?
It's all about love&hate relationships, they annoy me, I make fun of them (Mostly with stereotypical jokes), they can bare that and we get along. If they get too annoyed, they make fun of me, then we have a stereotype war for few hours and go for a drink. But really, I guess I'd complain about any nationalities I had to live with...
03I got less than 3 hours of sleep last night
Oh god I believed it.
Damn I wish I knew how to use colors

08,01i mean, i understand where you're coming from Pony; i've had my fair share of the unfun side of British Indian culture, but it's not right to make sweeping generalisations like that
Magical_pablez94: I know that.

Right now I'm running INternet Explorer

03seriously
Ah okay
03DS Lite + flash card in each slot
03best thing ever,.
And that's how I use colours
Pony: well i'm starting to get annoyed about this so u may stop right now. just 'cause i'm getting very nervous and i'm here to be happy and talk to people that don't care about my nationality
TIME
I don't see his issue. Instead, he gets to lead over them.
oh oO
TOAST!!!
I might do that, I use to use Mozilla in its earlier days

Yeah, I just ordered a bunch of archery equipment, but nopony in here cares about archery anyway.
the jailbait ok
just BURN *maniac laugh*
03DS Lite does suck yeah
but Matt Smith
03but my point being
I fully expect me to ban him after this.
14I guess that the best thing ever might be a modded DSL with DS d-pad and DSi brightness
03a non-DSi system
03no?
*him to ban me
wut
Whoot? Intermission? For what?
LunaTheBeloved: I was using PD colours
Kammerjunk: Archery is cool, I just don't know anything about it
>become a mod >randomly ban mods
Hey Matt Smith is alright, I don't mind him that much
what is this? Intermission fortunes?
08,01Pinkies4thWall: basically
14because of the GBA compatibility?
08,01Invi: it was only £6 or so
I wish I knew about archery
