BULLSHIT! I refuse to believe that that Twi and friends had outside help
it's the people who are actually there for a reason that it would matter
Dr. Whooves needs a better mic.
TheHoodyNinja: FAN ANIMATION, just ENJOY!
00,10eh help with what?

otakon: But i did
ANOTHER?
03like half the art on the main page is porn
03I'm not sayin this is a bad thing
03just pointing it out
I'm confused, wasn't Dr. Whooves already a pony? What happened? 6_9
00,10sadly this is all there is so far
no it's not
eh?
if it's porn, it's removed almost instantly
Aw....
Sumica: what about accel world new ep lol
-Sadness-
Gunthler: it's as if Dr. Who showed up in Equestria
The limitations of fan animation. *sighs*
inb4 people know shit about Dr. WHO
oh God
03I thought dA allowed mature content?
OMG! YEA!
Code Lyoko!

wudis
Code Lyoko with PONIES

03are basically what I"m calling porn
03anyway
what the hell man
03that's like half of what I see
You should play Pokemon The Abridged Series. idk
LOL
Oh wow
Code Lyoko
Wait wut
well, now that you mention it, te front page of DA does have questionable content
I remember this
03and no I don't go around looking for it
haha
Ninjazz: i know right?
I love you for streaming this Sumica
ok
03it usually always does
03that's my point
I'm on the front page right now
I remember watching like 1 episode of this
Sumica: there is a unfinished animatic by Waggoner too of the first audio recording.
08,01i was going to go to bed
Come get it get it
not a single questionable image
08,01like hours ago
how old is code lyoko
panda: Yeah, man. Jeez, I used to like this show. :D
I STILL say we should see Code Ment for some dumb laughs :P
04I'm sorta with drf here, random pictures of naked girls/guys doesn't really seem like art to me.
O SHIT
03well it's random
/me 08,01fails at bed
HELL YEAH!
Where Fluttershy?
DISEY
XD
as has been for the past every day I go on
I havent seen Code Lyoko in forever :D
no it's not
GASTON
Oh god win!
DISNEY***
Ninjazz: that show was like, the SHIT!
WHEN I AS A LD I ATE TWELVE DOZEN EGGS!
the front page isn't random, unless you set it to "newest"
And then Gaston was Rainbow Dash
02Nude isn’t supposed to be sexual, porn is
rainbow > gaston
Wait wut
04"Nude" is fine if it'
panda: It was, in fact, rather awesome, yes. :D
and it FITS DAMMIT!
well, cleavage
in which case, it would be uploaded too fast for the filter people to remove it
i liek Rainbow Dash :3
it's not blatant "HEY LOOK I HAVE A <censored>"
Please do not swear. You have said a swear word 13 time(s).
03that's what I mean, @ newest
AND EVERY LAST INCH OF ME IS COVERED IN HAIR!!
.-.
then don't put it on newest
wait..
code lyoko is airing a 5th season this year
SparklyWaffles: what's up?
lol
03even simpler is to not go to the site at all
03but
I remember this song :I
03my point being
win win win
03there's a ton of inapropriate stuff on there
any porn images that go through there are removed within hours
M-uh... The sky...?
00,10this fits so well
PWNIES: Of course, it's in Beauty and the beast
THIS FITS SO DAMN WELL!
honestly it's not that bad lol
DAT RD VOICE!
im the most stalked person at school
08,01dat beauty and the beast
Sumica: good editing
just like anywhere on the internet
It fits...
ahahahah
just better
there's a ton of inappropriate stuff on any site that consists of user-created content, really
MyLittleDashie: you are?
Sumica you should link this
04And the label "porn" is bent, screwed over and dodged at every opportunity
lol yea
also lip sync is horrible
it's hard to regulated everything
XD
-d
WUT?
GASTON
03well, an art site is more prone to getting mature art than something else
Gaston is a pussy
O_o
defining porn vs art is a bit hard & gery area etcetc
CrimsonPhoenix: it's not gonna be good, it's the action that fits and timing really
LOL
Sumica: are u gonna stream new accel world after this?
04Namely in the region of "erotic literature"
CrimsonPhoenix: I make amv's and such... lip sync is REALLY HARD!!!!!!!!!
The Pony Beboop intro video is still one of my favorites
00,10not this week
I know panda
i really REALLY liek Rainbow Dash xD
Expectorating=Spitting
"get large"....
o-o
CrimsonPhoenix: :D
08,01i love this song
Sumica: any word on Disney Week?
Sumica: NO ACCEL WORLD! why not?
idea is good though
I remember hearing pinkie pie saying she ate a hotdog in an episode :I
00,10cause I save them for fridays
Dinsey week?
BULLSHIT!
yes in the race episode
lol
an art site is more prone to mature art
but didnt stream it on fri cause u said u were gonna stream it on sat?
Maurice is the Chief I love it
that's such a fun comment I could tear apart
but didnt stream it on fri cause u said u were gonna stream it on sat? Sumica
http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/003/266/Gaston_Reads_Twilight.jpg
ah
sorry but im not gonna find a better time to post that
heres the DA definition
lol Firaga
I have this and it's sequal on VHS
Ew, Firaga.
NSFW/Q/text
Eddmario: ugh, the sequel
03LMAO that's actually fun to read :P
Eddmario: Sequel?
02all I know is that some sites are even more prone to mature content. Like how some people try to turn FB into a real porn site
I'm scared to ask for the summary
wait.... Rainbow Dash = Gaston?
6ok so
03um
6that's fun to read, yet you don't like the content on DA
SparklyWaffles: kind of
03who tries to turn FB into a porn site
03um
don't mention the sequel
does fluttershy= belle?
03did I ever say I don't like it
03I just said a lot of it is
Sumica: did u stream any accel world this week or are u saving these weeks and next weeks ep for next friday?
SEQUAL SEQUAL SEQUAL!
otakon: well... that's not weird at all. xD
Firaga: SHIPPING! SHIPPING EVERYWHERE!
Firaga: um, probably not. I think more like Twilight actually
sometimes people accidentally nude pictures on FB
6ok well
00,10saving two eps for next friday
02drf, lots of people do
08,01TheHoodyNinja x Firaga
6either way
6most of it is removed lol
Sumica: ahh ok
yeah
Twilight=Belle
/me hides from the shipstorm
is this Belle?
bbl guys going afk
otakon gets shipped :D
as with any other massively popular site
CrimsonPhoenix: eeyup
bye Shane377_The_Alicorn
i.e. youtube
03well except Facebook *actually cares* about nudity
03LOL
<.< It fits Twilight.
O THE NOSTALGIA, IT HURTS
Vordox: eeyup
otakon x Lyra :P
02both dA and FB do
08,01TheHoodyNinja x TheHoodyNinja's right hand
I need to watch Beauty and the Beast once OHGOD
SparklyWaffles: WONDERFUL NOSTALGIA!
So, I saw a production of West Side Story earlier tonight.
^
03no, dA says it's fine as long as it's not any of the stuff in that FAQ
03:P
wut......
mfw when i dont know any of these songs in english
Phase4: YOU ARE GOING TO GET BANNED PHASE4! D: Don't!
they're talking fancy
Bonjoutr!
WIN!
CrimsonPhoenix: go to Youtube, you can find it there in pieces
NOw THIS is good
6because nudity doesn't automatically mean porn
otakon: hold on
02^
^
02pretty much
03regardless of what term we're calling it
Oooh, my head is pounding the second this song came on... xD
04FB
CrimsonPhoenix: well, not right NOW ofc
03Facebook doesn't allow any of that
hey mario_pony!
I remember almost nothing from this, Cinderalla, and Snow White
03regardless of name
04*post image with cleavage*
6it's not inappropriate
04%00+ likes
6it's art
08,01the only otakon shipping that's allowed is: otakon ^ 2
04500*
The Beauty and the Beast!!
dat bon bon voice
hi MahBoi7771
oops :P
why is spike so...white
lol
*!
02besides
Hey, mario_pony.
02drf likes that stuff
that wasnt a swordfight
Daring Do!
i waslked into a public art gallery last year right?
/me hides
inb4 she was reading game of thrones
hi Ninjazz.
08,01panda: he is a solitary sailor
otakon: http://i.imgur.com/DXpfB.png
some topless girls, etc
some are even on brochures/guides
CrimsonPhoenix: thats all you have?
03well, whether you can call it art or not, it's still considered inapropriate for everyday stuff... not saying I care or not etc
yeah sadly
04which incites the "What the F*ck" reaction from me
XD
6actually
counted about 3/1
6that's debatable
08,01little mermaid > beauty and the beast
That fast?
Till season 3!!!!
PHOTO FINISH!
CrimsonPhoenix: Your name is Samuel :D
it depends on what you consider "inappropriate"
03most people consider female nudity as inapropriate LOL
D
6:/
lol
03at least
08,01panda: but some are rubbish
03if it's a boy looking at it
the adventurers hookers?
but I do have Lion king and Fox and the hound on DVD :D
02well yeah. they has been nude art ever since the man has existed
6and this is the area where more artists have to sit awkwardly while people talk about naked people
03regardless of any artistic point
08,01like that one about ancient egypt
08,01
08,01or moses
6I see naked people every week :/
02-the
CrimsonPhoenix: Samuel :D
08,01or something
Shipping
sumica u have portal 2 right
00,10yeah
6a lot of people think it's funny
03hey like I said, I'm not saying I mind... just that most people go "boys looking at naked girls, HMM"
nudity in art (in any medium), if used for a specific, meaningful purpose is not inappropriate
6and we just...yeah. we don't see any difference really
oh man youtube poop have completely ruined this movie for me, actually scratch that they made them even better
6uh
6again, define art
lol
03that's what I mean
twilight x rainbow
and the Rainbow Dash x Twilight became canon
i've read that fic
is colgate a time traveler too?
03you can blanket almost anything under that term
panda: no
6yep
true
inb4 beast is zecora
08,01the songs in Beauty and the Beast are absolutely wonderful, though
6until social taboo comes in
^
otakon: why does she have a thingy like dr whooves them
03just as how you could look up, say, how to build a bomb and say "oh, it's just education" when it could also be called terrorism?
6nudity is not exactly a social taboo
6porn is
Name one Disney song that's bad
I use "art" as synonymous with "medium" when I made my statement
panda: hourglass is a common cutie mark
as in
YAY!
OH GOD THIA
the hell?
03I know, bad example, I like extreme examples
If Rainbow Dash ever gets cannon shipped I'll be one pissed off brony :|
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/53016952/This%20Day%20Aria%20Transcription%20%28test%29.wav

Okie... Dokie... Lokie...

look at his MOUTH!
/me looks at his finely toned buttox
02no, it'll fly up into the sky
give me a head with hair, long beautiful hair
as a personal definition of art, I would define it as anything that engages me emotionally/intellectually, good or bad
/me runs
Beer lawl
otakon: Scream!
that's when people talk about video games being art I'm like
I know some of my renard
IT was a meme before, that had ALOT of followers.
*why
otakon: reminds me of the things from amnesia :D
03there's lots of art IN video games
though I need to listen to more of his stuff
since we cant post youtube links ill just write the name of the best video of gaston out there, "Gaston pleasures himself to the sound of his own voice"
Okay, TOO much hair!
panda: eeyup....
HAIR
6video games are art
03but as I said it's a blanket term, you can just shove whatever you feel like and say "oh, yeah it's art"
especially since I got all the collection
6everything about it is art
SOME MUCH
02^
03just as how you can clang pans together and say it's music
Lyra approves
well
So,,, anyone been haired lately? XD
Firaga: wut...
THESE POEPLE HAVE WAY TO MUCH BLOODY FREE TIME
but yeah
Eurobeat brony discord - PLAY IT
6actually
then again I preffer Mayhem than any of his style
02everything you see in a video game is art lol
6music can't be a blanket term
I think I might be just a teency bit disturbed.
[web]JRP2234: AGREED!
6art is
I been haired :D
Fleur seems to aprove everything on the screen, or she doesnt care
oh thank you god
then proceed to play epic musics
oh god what
OMG! YES!
VASH!
6music actually has definable features
oh god this video
suddenly Vash?
/me just doesnt care
I consider video games to be art
dat cat
Dat Stampede.
but it's not for everyone
/me glomps Fleur
Fleur: hm?
THE HELL IS GOING ON!?
hiya Fleur
/me hugs Sumica <3
now I want to watch Cardcaptor
cero chan?
03OK wow I am such a horrible person
02vidoes games are also the hardest kind of art to make
I am so confused atm
in the same way some people don't consider books to be art because they do not find books to be engaging or thought-provoking
Oh god this will be win
03I just blew up my pet wolf with TNT
whats this song
DeathStar|sick: why u sick?
03and saw cooked meat go flying out
/me reloads save
o-o
What is this i recodnize 3 animes so far
lol Fleur whats it like to be a trophy pony? :D
anime~
6video games start from a concept (art), need ideas (art), characters (art), background and layout (art), concept art (obvious), models and animations (art), gameplay (art)
mario_pony: I have a cold
THE HELL IS THIS I MUST KNOW!
FABULOUS
03story (not art)
I know some of thoes anime
/me hides
6and the overall feel to a game can be considered art as well
Sumica: TELL ME NOW DAMMIT!
inb4 art of programming
6actually story is art
Gunther sorry, not a trophy
03LOL what?
DeathStar|sick: eat chicken noodle soup
prose is art.
03well again blanket term :/
make that 6
Sumica: Whats a trophy wife's job?
coorection, I know most of thoes anime
02yes, the story is art
mario_pony: ok
00,10Spectacular Spectular from Moulin Rouge
dafaq
Fleur is best trophy wife :D
03let's just sum it up as "artists will call just about everything in life art" and be done with it
7
6the art of storytelling is a creative process that needs to invoke emotion/thought/interest etc
story is a blanket term in of itself lol
not a wife~
lol all the gropage...
02and then you have games like Zelda that have a LOT of reading
Well, she is the only one, panda.
Guys, I need to know what a trophy wife
oh japan
music, just like "art" doesn't have definable boundaries
it's debateable
8
fushi yuggi
WTF i just join CHAT and i see ASS xD?
DeathStar|sick: like right nao
Whats a trophy wife's job? :D
inb4 Ewan Mcgregor is best pony
DeathStar|sick: go Go GO!!
6music does actually
mario_pony: I just ate dinner
Ninjazz: hey, i think rarity would be a trophy wife
9
formal definition does
Sumica your casting i bet :D ?
panda: She would?...
but social definition/....
00,10eyup
xDDD
Ninjazz: oh gosh yes!
HELL YEAH!
lol can can
Sumica: What do trophy wives do? :D
6you can't just toss random beats and say it's music
dat FLCL
BUY ME MORE JEWELERRRYYYY
00,10things
6because music is defined by beats in a rhythym
Gunthler: look pretty
panda: She has the looks for it. ;)
10
Shoo-be-doo-shoo-shoo-be-doo
some people will
recodnized 10 anime
Ninjazz: exactly :D
02music is art. and anyone who says it's not shouldn't listen to it then :3
Sumica: Don't be vauge :D
I SEE IT
jolly good show
03music can be whatever LOL
WORST BLACK GU EVER VIDEO!
well, if for instance, I hear a song and think it sucks, I would consider that song to be art because it invoked disgust (an emotion) from within me
soul eater i see
OHN O
DO EET FILLY
Or Worst Black Voice actor XD
dat Jack Black
AWWW YES
JACK BLACK!
Dat Middle Finger
6if music can be whatever
6art can be whatever
if I hear a song that I completely indifferent towards, on the other hand, I would not consider that art
03I never said it can't
OCTAGONS!
03> let's just sum it up as "artists will call just about everything in life art" and be done with it

HAHA
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!

Okay, if I keep laughing any harder im gonna die... XD
Ninjazz: bc we are too busy freaking over THIS!
why no one ever stopped Mr. Rogers from cursing at children?
03intelligent design is totally the same thing as shoving religion in your face, which is why it pisses me off that they try to make it sound like science
otakon: Agreed. All my agree..
dude i already fainted earlier tonight
00,10fancy fu***** trolly

oh god
bacterium fallgelum argument
LOL
mr Rogers is a badass

/me sits in a corner and spins one of his knives
but it does not belong in a science classrom IMO
Too much Sumi...
Too much...
*o
Ninjazz: NOT TOO MUCH!
intresting thing is, in the news and such, they present intelligent design as a sensible, scientific, alternative to evolution for the readers to choose & decicde, but in reality it's not.
/me tries to find his sides
i stopped laughing half way through simply because i could not laugh anymore
dat Robert Fagot
WHOAH
03well what else pisses me off (as you can see in that episode), is that religious people will be like "You can't prove evolution so it's stupid", but... can they prove creationism?
otakon: He nealy killed us, man...
sumica just a secf
Sumica: i think everyone agrees that... nothing will beat that
03Tehy're just like "We don't need proof, it's religion"
03so why question science
NEKKID GRANDMA
03that's just making yourself look stupid

i have no idea what you people are watching... but i assume it was funny...

you can test the effects of things like natural selection and genetic drift
wut?
Midnight_Tempest: Dude... You missed out on the best video ever...
oh god
wut
both of which are central to evolution
6being in the awkward position of where I used to be, I know the mindset of religious people as if I were one :|
kentucky wut?
FISH
THATS racis LOL
just wut
Wow
Ninjazz: meh... im not in a laughing mood...
03yeah
city? England.
6so I can understand their thoughts on that matter
/me pats Midnight_Tempest on the back
Name of guy? KFC
So racist
Kentucky Fried Chicken........A NAME?
as can I
03the more I learn about religion, the more I want nothing to do with it really
02same Aurora
Dear lord... Dats Wacist.
mfw it's 50
but as a religious person I would put that aside because I don't want to impose my beliefs on others
00,10wth, why cut it off
KFP... kentucky fried panda, its finger ling-ling good...
Sumica: bc that was the funny bit
03it's funny though, we were learning in my humanities class that the church would actually hire scientists to do research for them
okay, even ninjas need sleep, night everybody
Ooooooh there's a good one in there
where did he get kfc from
6I used to be super religious, was about to be baptized, got a bit of a slap to my face by my dad
6and now I actually see the point in everything
no idea
good night TheHoodyninja
I distance myself from both because it's not worth worrying over
03it wasn't until the scientists started proving the church was wrong that they hated science LOL
Sumica: do you have the Jeopardy skits from SNL?
did you all die of laughter or is my chat derping?
sumica
00,10filmed with a potato
Night TheHoodyNinja! Sleep well.
6organized religion is just as dangerous as a kid with a gun :|
03^
Potato is best camera
inb4 Galileo and the heliocentric theory
03I'm sorta the reverse I guess, as I was baptized as a Catholic and expected to follow it

YES
YOU SPIN ME RIGHT ROUND
oh man this is awesome
SEAN CONNERY!
I have nothing against religious people or anything
xD
but it's not for me
You spin me right round.
6cuz they always go for those two
SNL XD
03what I have against most religious people is the fact that they won't accept that someone ISN'T
although the cut up is kinda meh
:D
6and I'm afraid that if I don't go, they'll call me out for when I used to be super religious
03I'm fine with the whole
the actual footage is great
6which wasn't that long ago actually
an album cover
You win the day, Trebek.
an al bum cover
My family is similar - they don't reallh care
6see
I'll have the Penis Mightier for 1000
03"I don't care what you believe in, I won't try to push my beliefs onto you"
Rare footage of will ferrel being funny
dat hat
/me dances
really*
03but how often does that happen? Not very often from experience :/
6I know a lot of people who accept them for whatever, they keep their faith while tolerating people as people
That's Pen Is Mightier
6but then there's people like westboro
03LOL
03yeah
XD
03>Jehova's witnesses
So... Much... Potato quality.
00,10so many fail versions
DeathStar|sick don't dance. you're sick :(
wat was dat
Sumica: yh, I know man
another POTATO recording
yaaaaaay
quality footage
and once again, FILMED ON POTATO!
Mutterguy: but I like to dance
XD
Firaga: there are no other versions
I'm a potato :D
00,10easy to spot at a glance
Firaga: verey few recordings
Who even has those tv's anymore?
00,10they all have lightsabers
Then there's people who just want to hate on something
03well
XD
panda: Whats a potato recording? :d
Ninjazz: *sniff*
F*cking superiority complexes
6I met a jehova's witness who actually didn't care that people had their own ideas on life, she was fine with it and went about her own business
Gunthler: means the quality is bad
6she's a friend of mine, I'm like "woah that's a first in my life"
Terribly sorry, Firaga. :'(
03I used to kinda not care about religion either, but... as of recently, I want to personally go around and slap anyone in the face who says that gays shouldn't be allowed to get married because it's against their religion :/
Gunthler: it's basically saying the quality is really bad
I know kung fu :D
I LOVE IT!
LAWL
JIMMY!
6see, I used to not care about that, I was semi-for prop 8
Dat Keanu Reeves.
back in my nick again ^_^
00,10I blame SNL being dicks with there videos
03I have no idea what prop 8 is
/me enjoys it
Sumica: eeyup
Hey, Rain!
Sumica: Their*
LOL
6but that was back when everyone thought that it would force churches to marry against their beliefs
Drf that goes back to the "don't push your faith on others"
Running gag much XD
6uh...that was the california proposition that went nationwide as a huge issue
Vordox: enope
03yeah I heard of it but I don't remember what it was about
6when the church wanted same sex marriage banned
03ah
Hat!
03see that's the thing
Meh
blurple
6but once I figured out it wasn't going to force churches to do anything
03who cares what the church says? Marriage is a *legal* status, it has nothing to do with religion
6I was like f* this
Rarity or Twilight would count.
03people get married in churches since it's all fancy
flerple
6marriage is also a religious theme though
03but technically
Potent Potables = Strong Alchoholic Drinks
03you can just
03go to a court
03be like
6you can't isolate it as just one side
03I'm marrying so and so
6it has two sides
03and done
Four Inch......oh god
aww no more fluer :D
03sure you can, what do you think happens when two athiests get married :P
6but for that reason, can't be settled as church's or state's
Nonetheless marriage originated as a religious thing
lol
03you don't *have* to do it in a church, it's just a common thing
6no you don't
XD
oh man i cant wait for bill&ted 3
03exactly
00,10liteurple
6but marriage IS also a religious theme
XD
6I'm not saying it's the only one
lol
^
/me is losing it
03so who cares if a certain church doesn't want to marry gays? They can just do it the legal way
03it can be, if you're a religious person...
02my parents didn't get married in church
LOL
6that's my f*ing point drf.
Sumica: i think i love you
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/666/ omg its 666
00,10sorry for bad quality

is*
Ricky Martin!
03really, all I have to say is
03http://sphotos.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/562377_421733894512090_100000264482893_1580051_1823991963_n.jpg
Good enough, Sumi.
03basically that
03:P
6I'm not saying it's right
HAHAH "Best WHoa"
cold
6I'm just saying that it is not purely at "legal" status
LOL
dat timing
HOT HOT HOT!
Sumica: no proble,
6*a
03right, but I'm saying that in states that allow gay marriage, it basically is in that case
Sumica: no worries it's hilarious
03or rather, recognize it
iced tea is best pony
I've been invovled with gay rights for some time, so obviously I'm sympathetic with regard to gay marriage
03since you can just go to canada
03XD
6wait what
lol
XD
where do these yays keep coming from
03at which part
Hahahha
I'm surprised the recorder isn't laughing his ass off.
6it is a religious status too, but that doesn't make it right to ban same sex marriage
6is my point
03no but I mean
I won't give you the satisfaction
03you can get married already, like, in Canada
I honestly don't know why people even consider gay marriage to be such a big deal
otakon: he isnt human
03two gay people can
i'm not laughing out loud at this, a small chuckle is good
03the question is, will the state (read: GOVERNMENT) recognize that as a legal marital status
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1649/ that's me with everypony in here
It's sweetie bot.
03or just consider it two people living together
XD
Famous mothers below me...
below me :D
LOL
03or say you get married in a state that allows gay marriage, then move to a state that doesn't
lol
03etc etc
/me dat laugh
6uh
6note this whole time I was talking about morals behind marriage, not the actual "what is happening"
03<Kosoveon> I honestly don't know why people even consider gay marriage to be such a big deal <- because a lot of religious people are as stubborn as I can be and refuse to acknowledge that their way isn't the only way
LOL
XD
6i didn't realize we were discussing that
lol
Wow. Sounds like Hollywood XD
drf, technically with regards to the constitution, they have to recognize it
Yet.
02if someone wants to be gay, why do they have to get married in the first place? It's not like it's Illegal to be gay or even have a civil union..
03I was talking about it being legal, not "ethical"
full faith and credit clause
oh god
6uh
so marrige gives caertain rights & priveledges. what are they?
03and yeah basically
6a lot of things besides just living together
03there are a couple things
03tax breaks
6taxes
Sumica. Did oyu see the link I asked you? 03
03insurance w/e

panda: EXACTLY!
Sumica: BEST REACTION EVER!
6I don't think there is a single state that actually outright doesn't recognize same sex marriage
Sumica: they didnt want their wives to kill them
bad decision if neither of them wanted to say a word...
This meant NOTHING to him XD He was the SMART one
6 /maybe/ utah, but idk
03I think most don't o.o
^
Those yays
6banning marriage as opposed to recognizing
hen3ry: it was describing their wife in BED
the only wrong anwer was dopey
02I thought civil unions let people have those rights
where dey comin from
03no
there are a lot of states that have it in their constitution
yes, I know. But the decision to "play?"
6to not recognize it?
that marriage is defined as between a man and a woman
huh
6k
so de facto, yes
interesting
lol
LOL
it also happens to me when someone says "Rain" or "Fleur"
lol
03as far as I know, there are only like... 10 states that regognize gay marriage?

LOL!

What is DAT!
ZERO!
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwww
XD
Fucking shit!
Kidding me. :D
02Problem is, two people of the same sex kind of goes against the definition of marriage. Just sayin’
I thought they were still in that process
I HEARD someone say "ZERO"
number 1 answer was your mom
What?
bluefare
lol whats a gyenecologist? :D
oh no

My face hurts now

Ins't it Drivers sidedoor? <.<
03I need to find that one picture
yeah what drf said
please say A
03as it made me laugh so hard
03it was like
03these people eating dinner
"back end"
C
03and this guy goes "Wow, the marriage of these two flavors is brilliant"
c
6the definition of marriage has kind of evolved over the years
Vordox: perpendicular, i.e. across not near
03and you see the marriage police come over
Whats a gynecologist? :F
it's A DAMMIT!
Bob Saget...
exacto
00,10your answeres?

Gunthler: SHH

ALL OF THE ABOVE

03yeah

a or b if i understand correctly, idk the difference between and b
Q.
........
D
Z.
i see marriage as marriage
/me hugs Kammerjunk
6I see marriage as however people want to see it
03and heck, call it a civil union, as long as they get the same legal rights...
6I don't care how people see it, that's fine
WAIT SHIT!
03the name is more a formality
dam it steam
which avoids when people go "well, if you allow gay marriage, then why not marriage with children and pets"
/me hugs Phase4 back.
PERPENDICULAR
03LOL
6I just flat out don't care
Example of perpendicular lines: +
C!
03technically dogs can sign a marriage contract
that's just f*ing dumb
03or something silly
Hey, Kammerjunk.
We have our Driver side on the left side. :P
6because once you care, people get upset in some way
Kind of a wierd question tbh
Oh hi.
C
THATS NOT WHAT PERPENDICULAR MEANS
hurry up and pick c
it's the country of freedom yet they are going to try to say people can't marry who they want
Hello.
what
nooo
6koso, if that's how you want to define it
oyou fool
C!!!!
passanger side you ninny
dammit wommah!
i define marirge as a "commitment btw 2 ppl"
i know this is kind of a dumb way to see it
03again:
what I mean by that aurora
6you can't have a marriage with a human and an animal because we wouldn't know if the animal consented
03http://sphotos.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/562377_421733894512090_100000264482893_1580051_1823991963_n.jpg <- see this

00,10trickquestion sleighs have no doors
but false advertising
^
02But how would it be legit if they’re not even sexually compatible? Again, just saying
Sumica: SON OF A BITCH!
Sumica: LAAAAAAAWL
6exactly
that is DIRTY POOL!
Sumica: :D
Sumica: you troll you

Sumica: santaa dose

03BlueFlare, you're implying that marriage and sex are actually related?

SO MANY IDIOTS
lawl
LOLz.
03since I mean
JUST LIKE US :D
whoa
MAH LAWD

03people get pregnant in high school

Vordox: trick question

sorry but it won't happen
03LOL
danny bonaduce

Phase4: goddammit

YOU RUSE
see
and HI :)
Sumica: grr...
there is no solid definition of marriage
Wait...HOW?
and then she had a heart attack
6there is not singular-
the correct answer is lesbian
CupcakeWarrior: trick question
Fail.:(
6yeah what he said
I dont even...huh?
as with many things
02And if they try to be sexually compatible, then that’s just gross and unhealthy
We thought it was car. :P and SOME Sleighs ACTUALLY had doors...
22.22
perpendicular means at a right angle to you.
:P
otakon: no... its not
6that's their decision
WOO IM GONNA GO BUY A SHIRT!
define "unhealthy
"
03"Straight marriages are valid because they produce children. Gay couples, infertile couples, and old people shouldn't be allowed to marry because our orphanages aren't full yet, and the world needs more children" <- there you go BlueFlare
CupcakeWarrior: a sleigh has no doors
03and granted
03that picture I linked
6just like it's my decision not to shower every single day of the year
you're a wonderful person, but you stay poor
03is complete sarcasm
panda: yes it IS since SLEIGHS DO NOT HAVE DOORS
03which is why it's awesome
otakon: thats not the reason why she was wrong though
we don't need more children
03The other awesome one
02I mean really unhealthy
the human population is too big
otakon: santas dose I saw it in a movie
lol
Thats not what perpendicular means though
otakon: THEY DO!
i thought it was korea?
6how is it unhealthy
04Well that was fun
6just asking
yeah, go ahead and prove santas sleigh doesnt have doors
indeed

02don't see why it has to be a marriage
oh this is fun
bye Ninjazz
00,10perhaps
60 spidey
Lol
03because of the legal rights associated with being married
because they want it to be called *marriage*
Vordox: I think he might be
04@Vordox: I had to patch Mortal Kombat
03or maybe not rights, but whatever you want to call it
03legal status I guess?
aside from the legal benefits of it
Ghosties: . <.< On Console?
6no the point is you left girls out, we're trying to figure out how sam-sex relationships are more unhealthy
6*same
04Yes

... why this song?
02well, sexually it would only be possible for guys to make it unhealthy
03uh
03what
what
00,10why not
straight couples can have just as many unhealthy side effects
Ghosties: Tell me when the game is fun.:P
02^
02true
*cough* STDS *cough*
touche
Sumica: does modest moust have anything to do with funny... or spiderman? XD
6look my point is
02but at least they can do it the right way if they want
04It is fun
6you used a very horrible example
MK9 is better than the recent entries
the "right way"
what
04Muuuuuuuuuuuuuch better
IM A PONY
pony XD
6and all of us had a perfect way to oppose your example
but nowhere good for competitive gmaeplay
I didn't know there was a "right" way
pony :D
pony
6ok well
Ghosties: i learned a long time ago that playing MK with bros is the best way to spend an evening
6you know what he means
it doesn't really matter

;P
I know
:P

Eat dick nigga :D
nope
6i wouldn't say right way either, but eh
Sumica: nope
Sumica...no im laughing my ASS off right now
This is great....
dis shat funny
6that specifically is for personal opinions
02Kosovo, I didn’t want to sound suggestive
win
04The problem is that none of my friends actually want to play fighting games with me
song
6that is a fact that can't be argued, unlike his earlier one
60's spiderman is so prone to meme
Ghosties: cuz you are so good :D
Ghosties: I only have ONE game I like when fighting, the Blazblue Series.
this issue can't be solved in congress, it won't be solved in a chatroom
XD
04That actually is the case, panda
definitely gay
I would love to play fighting games with you, Ghosties. But we dont have any in common :<
04None of them play fighting games except for me >>
02lmao
I know, but the way you said it implied it was the only way it should be done
03who said anything about solving it?
:D
02true
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4403/
03It's just a debate :P
6well
6actually
Ghosties: i wish i could say challenge accepted but i had to pawn my ps3 :(
6in congress, people are more politic based
yeah
04Actually, Vordox reminded me that a couple of them do play BlazBlue and Guilty Gear
6us as everyday people, admittedly we have a different grasp
and results can come from the most unlikely of places sometimes
I disapprove of your bill Aurora, I am gonna filibuster it :|
6not to mention congress is a bunch of older ages people
/me runs
yeah fu...nvm
04But I don't play those games much, so I'm no good at them :I
like the little girl who found a way to beat cancer
6we're actually a part of the new generation
same reason nobody likes to play fighting games with me :\
Ghosties: Of course, the good gamess has fans that won't release, instead of the Mainstream who just throws stuff aside quickly :P
knifegun!
Skrillex?
NOPE MUTE
MY EARS
Ghosties: Try training Blazblue! IT's fun when you understand the mechanics!
0.o
oh god, scrilix :\
well we are
not sure about kyu

I love you guys even more
04And yes
00,10owwwww

00,10I prefered the last song
The "Big big ones"

Sumica: well... i agree XD
Fuck skrillex.

Ooh, this is the new Loony Tunes? :P
03OK seriously, you know what made me laugh and facepalm at the same time?
dat anime ripoff
Firaga: Good luck finding it.
i'll agree with that, i am not sure if it was originally thought of when it was first made
but that doesn't mean it's right to shoot the idea down
WHAT THE BUCK IS HAPPENING IN THE STREAM!? MErry Melodies?! NO way!
03Some old religious lady was trying to say that the reason Judas betrayed Jesus, is because Judas was homosexual
03I'm like
03facepalm
Vordox: skullgirls is keping me sane tough
erm
how does one ripoff an entire genre of animation?
blueflare
asdf
Vordox: eeyup, the Looney Tunes show.
otakon: No bucking way
Rain what?
daffy gets all the elven wenches
Rain: it was from Kekkaishi, the cube technique
Firaga: It's a decent game, but it's too broken
This is definately parodying animes :P
Spell-of-Gaming: eeyup
00,103....2.....1
otakon said dat anime ripoff
CELESTIA
sumica did u get my pm cuz myirc has been playing up recenty

I just have strong feelings about it because I am highly involved in the cause
lol Sumica
he is finding who???
Sumica: WHERE is this from? WAS it aired on tv?! No way
CELESTIA
6koso, i'm a little more sensitive to earthquakes than a lot of people
dat Celestia
02legit*
6I grew up on a fault
CrimsonPhoenix: right on cue
Vordox: i agree, also waaaay too hyped for having only 8 characters
THIS IS TOO 80S FOR THE 2000s!!!!
dat ice
Vordox: TV
00,10yeah it's the new loonytoons
03I have strong feelings too but, how does one become involved, just curious :P
DaffyxCelestia
IT IS NOW CANON

Aurora: has super powers
Sumica: BUCK IT! I'm going CHild again and getting these!
00,10the one on cartoonnetwork

by joining groups and protesting and trying to take an active role
Sumica: u streaming this epicostity?
to the moon?
WHAT?!?!
03ah
O_O
which I've been done since I started high school
thats no celestia
03if there were any of those protests around here I'd probably go
Daffy x Celestia? ewww
LAWL
03but LOLMichigan
....what
6I don't want to shoot anyone down here for anything
03we just sit back and laugh at other states :D
three days
3 days...
ur mum
Okay....THIS LOOKS INTERESTIN!
6I just don't really approve of protesting in general
03yeah
03same
03since
6unless it's VERY CLEARLY a fault
00,10it's just a one off
Three days :D
03when's the last time it's actually helped anything
6like what the universities here are doing
03>Occupy Wall Street
Vordox this is just a spoof
03they just like
00,10the whole show is not like this
03make everyone hate them
Sumica: Don't care, if they do it once, they'll do it again!
03LOL
Vordox: it's a okay show, the Merry Melodies are the better stuff
This should be an entire series
The whole is more slice-of-life
well aurora it depends on the perspective of the group
04Also, Vordox, I have MvC3
6but in the case of religion vs state, there really is no absolute answer
03I mean sure it's a good cause
6yeah
6perspective of a group
03but protesting doesnt'really help it
wait what is that
.......good god
Ghosties: And how fun is that game when in Meta?
this is gold
02See, I don’t mind when people are gay/for gays, but I also don’t mind when people are against gays as long as they don’t try to be bias
Guess what? I have half life 3 :P
that is how my mind works
YAY!
6meaning that other groups are having their opinions shot down
Ghosties man, i wish I would have known that a week ago haha

04Kenshi is not 24, he looks at least mid 30s
Phase4: 2 stupid dogs
.....um

if people kept their opinions to themselves about all social issues we wouldn't have the social progress that got us through some of the most turbulent times in our history
6what exactly is it that your group does, koso
panda: i'm thinking of the soda in this
Ghosties: <.< Who is Kenshi?
Phase4: oh XD
liquid feem i think

04Blind swordsman
the *protesting* part isn't the main aspect

02Well, that would just be my personal opinion which I wouldn’t force on anyone
6I'm not attacking anyone btw, trust me, if i were attacking you, I'd be letting off a long stream of curses and anger

Attack! Attack! Attack!
04Hello 47~~

6why is it wrong to you
04Your next assignment will take you into the heart of Tokyo, Japan
*Dances out of chat and into bed* night and bye
There has to be a REASON you disagree
lol
lol wut?
cheese horror
cheesy'
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4876/ This would be better without the caption
spelling fail
6just like i have answers for my opinions, there's normally a reason behind an idea
dem tentacles
look at that budget
............
6if not, you then have an irrational opinion which you should probably sort out
OH MY GOD
0_0
IN KIDS MOVIE!?
O.O
kids show
lol
00,10for kids
KIDS SHOW TF?!
Umm...
Oh god win
how did they get away with this?
You know, dor kids!
CrimsonPhoenix: lol
ok...
Thats some...interesting stuff...
CupcakeWarrior: dor kids!
6and I really don't care what your answer is, I just want one
wow... 90's sexual inuendos
Firaga, it was the 90s
It's probably one of those gut feelings where you just feel that it's /wrong/
for*
because that is what thier target demographic is doing XD
6not just a "my idea"
:D
lots of stuff got by
Firaga: cleaner than animainiacs
00,10they got away with it cause they said noting
02to me? It’s unnatural, *can* be unhealthy, I was raised to think it’s wrong, etc.
^
02That’s just my opinion
/me carves 'Midnight_Tempest wuz here' on the chat walls for fun...
6alright
That's perfectly fine
that's fair
00,10you can get away with implyed naughty and double entaundre

6what I just did to you is probably somethig you should get used to
even today?
00,10yep
the audios a bit out of sync....
as enlightening as this is, its getting pretty late so im callin it a night, smell ya guys later
00,10just no one wants to be clever any more
02well yeah XD
6being able to back up your opinions other than just saying "it's how I feel" is a fundamental to getting anywhere in life
Aurora is ruthless
out of sync....
o.o
6being where i used to be with a church, I learned that quckly
good morning everyone
/me washes away the walls so there is no carvings on them seeing as there are no walls
Sumica: well... everything was done in the 90's so... now... people cant compare
00,10it's the video
Poo-poo nuggets?
typical disney employee
wat
6and I learned that to have any credibility, you better have a backing to your thoughts
LIQUID FGEEM
feem'
derp g
02I noticed XD
6cuz people will tear you apart, and there are some horrible people on both sides

getting confrontational with people
HEYAYAYAYAY
CupcakeWarrior: Believe it or not I heard the orignal first.

CupcakeWarrior, I do..

Ghosties: i knew it :D
Ghosties: I dont :/
6it's rather boring

After this, Mario was given food, and thus he became fat.

Ghosties: I don't get what's happening here ><
derpy has the iron flank
I thought it was edited on netflix
04And it's confirmation that Toonami returns regularly on Saturday nights starting May 26th
00,10it was.
Soooo, on that note.... TOONAMI IS FUCKING COMING BACK! YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES!

02XD
Twilight!!
What reason is that, Ninjazz?
applejacks theme <3
00,10cause it's a 5.1 sourse and stream only hears 2
Sumica. This is the only...show with AJ as a "Main focus" yet she's barely in the movie from 12+ minutes...
XAX: Toonami comes back.
XAX: http://www.adultswim.com/shows/toonami/

hi guys just arrived, what are we watching?
cause i was making hot chocolate
DAT MAYOR
Dat greedy mayor
She's just mayor =3
alll aboard is comin aboard
To maintain Ponyville you need bits.
04You should ALWAYS check
:O
:(
Do we know if the mayor likes pickels?
04The internet is a very resourceful place, my friend :)
:)
*pickles
Animations..
It's CN, they don't usually make good decisions.
04But in any case you are welcome ^_^
I can't be random when Pinkie Pie is around.
04Adult Swim and CN aren't the same company though
00,10it's day time and barn has windows. How did they turn out the lights?
Dat Big Mac.
Aww Pinkie
04Kinda like Nickelodeon and Nick @ Nite
Serriously though... I am freakin pumped!
magic
:O
Oh... I didn't know that.
04As am I, good sir. As am I
NO DAT BUFFER!
How are they going to manage that?
04But again, not the same people
Sumica: you've seen the mistakes are forever.;)
00,10yes
You're not going to stay for brunch? :(
04Yes, they're not the same people
Like Toonami on one day and Adult Swim on another? Or are they going to split the hours?
and the mayor loves her monnneeeyyyyyy
hmm
00,10One of my guildies back in Wow Works at Wilimas St
Munny.
04Toonami begins midnight on Saturday, I believe
dat AJ

04Sumi, I'm not getting into an argument with you. For god's sakes, you don't even want to believe that Mass Effect 3 is riddled with controversy and is a *bad* product.
I really dont care about the toonami thing really

00,10uh argueing?
huh?
:/
;)
:)
Say the line, Sumi...
INB4 "Were we arguing? I'm sorry."
Come on..
there is a dumb x-chat hotkey that i keep acidentally hitting that parts the channel
02XD
:(
dat tophat pony
04Also, I'm not watching the stream
D:
and not sure hot to configure it
04So if he's saying anything I can't hear him
it's not in the hotkeys tool section
Sumica: Why no Mass Effect 3 stream?
00,10No it just seems Ghosties just has been wanting to jump me over somthing from 6 hours ago
dafuq pinkie
He's showing Last Roundup.
02wb drf
03thanks
she flushed and appeared on screen in the same instance
04Wut?
Dat's my aunt.
CrazyCherry: She's.....cherry
Vordox: X3
I just told my brother and he is freaking out too! :D
Man, that great news.
04Now where are you going with the conversation, because all I said is that I'm not getting into an argument over adultswim and CN being or not being the same company
Why are people so excited about toonami coming back?
I think you both misunderstood and communicated wrongly, Ghosties and Sumica
I love my aunt.
rawr
04Because of Tom
CupcakeWarrior: My childhood was Toonami.
04It's not the shows, it was never ever about the shows
03I should have gone to bed a couple hours ago >_>
00,10I never said they were. Not sure where you even got that I was disaagreeing with you then you turn it in to a game argument. You are geting to be as Bad as Nitt
@Tom or Tom Rock? XD

04It was always about Tom and the atmosphere
where does the brown Cherrys go??
my girlfriend is a clone of pinkie pie, its really annoying
I only even cared to watch like 1 show on toonami
If it wasn't Doom or Blues Clues, it was Toonami.
04You were coming at me with the "I have a guild friend that works at Williams Street" thing
MysteryPony: In the trash bin.

Dat Rarity.
^
i have a feeling there will be a fight among fights here in the chat
Speeeeeed it uuup!
04No sir, you said "I have a friend that works at Williams Street." If you were actually going to agree with me you would have said "You're right, they're different companies"
ded
That should have scraped her plot really bad
Cherry sauce!
O.O
/me jumps in the Cherry sauce.
PInkieGUn
I have a confession to make. I have been anti pony for quite a while until today, it all started with a simple clip on youtube, then I watched a random episode. I have been watching my little pony for the past eleven hours and I have not slept at all. WHATS HAPPENED TO ME
aj stood no chance
The sad thing about this episode is that most forget that this is a AJ episode. The Derpy Incident overshadowed most the like for this.
04Ditzy, get out while you still can
ditzyderpydoo: You found the magic in the show. :D
help
me
04Or just stay here, or something
ditzyderpydoo, that's pretty much the pony taking over
maybe...*sniff* maybe
ditzyderpydoo... welcome to the cross roads.

04"You're right, they're different companies"
I WANNA SLEEP
/me is reminded of the pinkie as navi videp

ditzyderpydoo: Welcome to the fun. :) Hope you understand now why we bronies say it's good. :P
i havnt slept in 50 hours and counting
00,10guess I was too obscure then sorry if I came off as dissagreeing with you
ditzyderpydoo: GO SLEEP RIGHT NOW!!
/me made a Cherrychanga some time ago :3
Charlie Sheen...
Starflash: how was it?
04No biggie, man. S'all gravy
it was delicious.
NO SLEEP, I NEED MOAR PONIES :<
04...gravy
04Fuck, I'm hungry
I turned into pinkie for like 15 mins.
ditzyderpydoo: If you like ponies, welcome to the herd. If you don't want to be part of the herd. Get some sleep.
Buiscuits and Gravy
Ghosties: damnit Ghosties. now I am hungry too...
i take every negative thing back that ive said about the show
good news for BlueFlare
Biscuits*
you'd doom us all Starflash
Ghosties: Go eat.
Oh no...AJ is screwed...
Naw :3
Im a good pinkie :3
She is Screwed
:O
ditzyderpydoo: Just remember, don't push the "MLP IS AWeSOME YOU MUST WATCH IT" schtick
what did you say ditzyderpydoo
YOU PINKIE PROMISEDX
ditzyderpydoo: Those are the worst about bronies, just make it smooth for others if you want to advert for the hsow
ditzyderpydoo: You sound just like me a few months ago.
Pinki assasin
Pinkie rage.
OH NO SHE DIDNT
02yay Solar Eclipse
no bunny nooooo
00,10So far as defending masseffect. Yeah some parts of what Nitt spouts off is just horseshit so I will call him on it.
aw :'3
let's be honest here
Sumica: That's the power of disagrement, noone is right noone is wrong. :)
are you at all in the path for t he full eclipse
Dat Bunny
04Like I said, I don't want to get too far into an argument like that :P
02yep
what in the what the what the what?
I blame EA.
04Hell, I'm not even a fan of Mass Effect
wow
jealous :P
anyone get the reference?
no/
04So it's honestly not like I know the whole truth or anything
?
02XD
Sumica: Why no Mass Effect 3 stream?
...
00,10cause I dont feel like gaming
PINKIE PROMISE
why do I keep hearing "yay" :o
BREAK IT AND YOU'RE DEAD
Sumica
ditzyderpydoo: That's the streamer's ping.
= YAY
If you're bored Sumica: Try streamplayng the Magic is the boredom.
ditzyderpydoo: Those are the pings
ooh
no loop hole there she broke the promise
it's adorable <3
00,10but yeah I am not looking to defind my points on it with yiou Ghosties
yay ;3
yayyy :3
So this version, it was the one where Derpy had the male voice, right?
04Like I said, I don't either
Ghosties: Your thoughts on Halo?
04It's 6:30 AM my time, so yeah :P
Silly AJ

04I don't like Halo :/
Kandarihu: The original version, yes.
DED
"Oh "Buy some apples""
Do you like CoD/
Ghosties: I thought so....
O D
Did the conflict with derpy hooves being "offensive" ever end with original derpy getting back on the show?
04I dunno, it's just not my cup of tea
You ded now?
04I prefer Doom
Applejack and her pride... <3
^
Damn.
04Very fast, very brutal, all manly
ditzyderpydoo: Its coming back in the future
Ghosties: Yay Dom!!
Derpy i mean
Doom was the good old days.
yayyyy <3
04Lol Dom
Doom*
Ghosties: Doom 3?
04Doom 3 is good, I have it on Xbox and PC
Every game, but halo 2
/me hides
04But Doom II is my favorite FPS of all time :)
doom 4 coming soon, itl probably be another duke nukem forever
04Oh god I hope not
Ghosties: My favorite FPS? Duke Nukem.
Every Pony, But you
04I really, really hope it won't be a DKF
It's sad that he is probably right.
04DON'T SAY THAT ;_;
naaaw
RD is best bluepegsipony
d'awwww
04I mean, think about it
I know man... I know...
CAWADOOTY WITH MONSTERS.JPG
giant daww.
04Doom 3 was a vast departure and it was pretty good :O
fluttershy, why you make everyone cry?!
Ghosties: Have some hope for Doom 4. I heard some interesting rumours about it
Its fluttershy
Their last game was RAGE.
big maaac :3
crusj jer
/me has RAGE too
rage on PC was horrible

That wasn't too good... I liked Doom 3.

soccer_moms_can_go_die.png
Kandarihu: It would have been safer if they input the full story
04I mean, it's no Borderlands or anything like it looked like it was imitating but it was decent
Why does RD going to get it???
It was. Just I was expecting more from Id.

CHALLENGE: WATCH ALL OF G3 WITHOUT VOMITING
Hi CrazyCherry and Kandarihu
i thought solar eclipses only last a few seconds
he said he was tired not that he was going to sleep
/me drops the Bass!
Challenge rejected
awww, no shoo be doo
If they get the original Doom Feeling of "BEING IN FRICKING HELL" in 4...I might try it out
ditzyderpydoo: Done.
Ghosties: Just don't go expecting the game everyone is hoping for... :(
sorry about that is everyone okay?
why wouldn't we be MysteryPony
I've lost all hope for gaming these past few years.
04Eh
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4875/ i found this so funny
04It won't take much to please me
whys my name on here twice...
02at peak they do
04Just some ass kicking music, fast action, and plenty of levels
oh
alexxm: well i droped the bass!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R52P9zvuplQ&feature=g-u-u <--- PONIES IN D3?!?!?!?!
anyway...
04Hell, there doesn't even need to be a story
Ninjazz: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4875/ i found this pic so funny Twi_Fi
OKAY, SERIOUSLY BUCK YOU Blizzard, SERIOUSLY BUCK YOU
and alexxm as well
Considering how many game stories suck nowadays, that wouldn't be a bad thing.
DAMNIT! my brain is processing coding ideas, problem is they are javascript ideas and it realy should be on my classwork which is c and pascal
04...okay, I'll admit, I don't want Doom 4 to be a multiplayer experience purely
Wrek can you kick the normal ACS13123 for me? i think it bugged
In any case, the whole point of this series is to reconcile audiences that MLP was always meant for (young girls) with audiences that normally never had any interest at all (us). It's unacceptable for there to be a broken base in this fandom.
lol Shane377_The_Alicorn :D
LOL guys this picture http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4875/
Ninjazz: i kno right
/me falls on the ground and starts to sleep

04Yeah, pretty much
All with my BFG.
Woops, not Wrek...
I mean
04I want a good single player experience but with something resembling a story
SWAG!
story - 2012
yeah right
04Like I said, it doesn't need to be Shakespeare, just something that warrants a full single player mode
Ghosties: can you kick the normal ACS13123 for me? i think its bugged...
DO EXPLOSIONS COUNT AS STORY
/me levitates CrazyCherry into a bed and tuck em in
I gotta know. Was April Fool's Day the first time Pre-G4 MLP was shown on the stream?
Agreed.
02I'm almost off of it's path, so I'm not sure if I'll get to see a full "peak"
04There it goes
Thanks
CRUSH, DESTROY , SWAG!

Dinky is best filly
02I would be on the black line on the bottom
Ninjazz: Well time for gamer`s to rais agiens the copresions! while Dubstep plays in the background!
So what? The only way that question is going to be answered is if my IRC is broken?
ok
is the stream not playing for anyone else?
So...whos streaming next...
MysteryPony: Can't we have metal playing instead? :(
one way to find out
Phase4?
:P
:p
hmmmm
ditzyderpydoo: the stream is down
:(
hes thinking...
Hey, Phase4. Wanna stream again?
Oh I see that steam notification.
Ninjazz: Well Metal is more old school Gamer! We need to represent the comming generation of gammers!!!
ACS13123: i dont think anyone will be streaming for a while and i dont think Phase4 has full permission yet even tho he is a techie
putting up a vote for the first episode in the discord arc
I gotta know. Was April Fool's Day the first time Pre-G4 MLP was shown on the stream?
MysteryPony: But I am part of that old school generation! :'(
Shane377_The_Alicorn: He was streaming yesterday :P
02I'll try to get pictures if it happens
ACS13123: for alike 10 mins tho lol
good luck
i'll ask

02thanks
normal cameras usually can't handle that type of stuff
02mine can :D
Ninjazz: me too! but we cant lead a peapol who thinks we are outdated!
/me sighs
whats the matter Ninjazz

MysteryPony: Aye... I'll just listen to metal on my iPod while we fight for justice.
rainbow dash
Kandarihu, I think at least sea ponies was streamed earlier than April the 1st.
darnit
alexxm: The gaming world sucks.
being the only one awake in the house
derpy all the way for me
and being the only one awake in the house who has to sneeze
worst pony is flutterbitch from iron will episode
/me hugsa Ninjazz and draws his sword! charging into the horde of modern FPSers!!!
If I ever become a streamer, I'll be more respectful of demands for ponies.
02http://www.mreclipse.com/SEphoto/SEphoto.html
02you just need the right stuff
/me joins in charge with a sad face.
02and be careful
Kandarihu: I don't believe you.
Not one bit.
lol
yes
/me mumbles gibberish
OMFG season2 of Downton Abbey
since you are pretty much blinding yourself
oh wow, save point was a while back
i'm gonna go have some blueberry muffins for breakfast nao
02yeah
bye friends
im hooked.
i'll play up to where i was, if no one else starts to stream by then i'll stream
:<
05http://i.imgur.com/0ztt9.jpg
Cya ditzyderpydoo. Welcome to the herd.
04Ah man
lol
04Blueberry muffins
04Lucky
yay, mor Beyond good and evil :)
Wrek, dat crysalist
pretty much go wild and start taking pictures of the air randomly over and over again until you hit it
i cant spell that word
Ninjazz: why do you doubt my intentions?
Kandarihu: If I recall correctly, you seem to like the old gens... namely 3.5.
Phase4: Crysalis
02inb4: use a 1800MM lens and look through the view finder
No thats a derp too.
Chrysalis.
Not nearly as much as ValtheJean
lol
But the point is, you would respect viewer demands with "poines" right?
04"Ponies
04"
I will respect viewer demands of the animation of G4, and not go all genie on you.
04Key word "Ponies"
05good news guys
ponies*...
darnit i need to blow my nose
04Oh wait, we're not talking streaming ponies :P
but i don't want to wake anyone up
How did I miss that?
05i jsut got hold of the hardest item to get in D3 needed for the secret pony level
02I probably won't use a Telephoto lens
053 to go
:O
02to play it safe
ok, up to where i was
04Best of luck, Wrek
Wrek, we're hearing this in proffessor farnsworth voice?
04Oh, and I wasn't trying to correct you Ninjazz :P
Wrek, you gona stream or shal i?
04In fact, I thought you said it right
05uh
lol
04But bleh, no troubles
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xR5DaYuDWYs&feature=autoplay&list=FLAViXIrbp86kg5lvVfFdQuQ&playnext=1 :D
05sure i could strem soe
Thanks, man. :)
However, I will do it on my own time. I might stream stuff that's well, "difficult" to watch. And you don't even HAVE to ask for ponies. I'll stream an episode after it.
Does someone belive in The Hub for the rerun in 1 1/4 hours?
Did the new herd member go to bed?
I see, Kandarihu. But you probably would get tired after the first 100 demands of poines.
Ghosties: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLD3aqkGYWM&feature=bf_next&list=FLAViXIrbp86kg5lvVfFdQuQ <-- :D ValTheJean would LOVE this
He went to go get some breakfast, Vordox.
Ninjazz: He needed sleep ><
why not use both?
05story of my life: http://imgur.com/rsotr
He said he was going to, ;_;
lol Wrek
I don't even hide it anymore, it still feels odd as hell.
lol Wrek
Wrek: are you closet brony???
02See, I’m kind of worried about my camera's sensor :\
04Interesting video, Vordox
i figured that if he started watching all the episodes he must be nearly half way through season 2
Ghosties: It's based on the DS version of Robot Master Wars series
It's the final boss theme
Maybe. But I know there is a common interest among everyone who comes here. It's not video games or Japanese anime. It's not classic cartoons or live action shows. It's Ponies. And it's not ponies as they've been known all my life. It's the G4 ponies alone. That's what we ALL love.
04Oh, neat
A sec, let me find the original
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhO9DzQmlak
From here
whos streaming then?
05look closley MysteryPony
Sounds like a KH bgm, Vordox.

Unnecessary math, Vordox,
Val seems to think that the Brony identity entails a love of all generations. I don't think that way. That said, I DO like the twintailed mane of G3.5 Cheerilee. I just find it different and immorality excepted, I like different.
Ninjazz: Correct. that is PM and AM
Much easier to just say 8:55pm
Kandarihu: Good point, :)
Ninjazz: Oh really?
Thanks
Kuma

Eyup.
Oh hai, it's 12:35 here! "Cool it's 21:23 Here"
"Oh we're 9 hours off!"

Otherwise it's "Oh it's 11 PM here" "Oh it's 14:52" here

Wrek, using tablet?
Whoofs: is it posible to travel back in time if you go fast egunf around the earth!"
Oh
MysteryPony: No
*builds time traval machine*
Time is... Six... fifty-seven... AM.

BYE EVERYPONY
Whoofs: Can you make use of the time curve with such a simple mechanic?
Umm yes
BYE Whoofs!!
IM OFF TO 1994
Cya Whoofs.
Or will you make use of the mass effect theory of bending time space to within it's ownexistance?
vordox stop the confusing thing
I guess most people here know about Time Space Physics. :)

Oh hai Sumica Couldn't sleep?
Arn't you supposed to be sleeping, Sumi?

AHHH
*ggets bloody cut on body*
Whoofs: It's not confusing, it's simple mathemathics.
Brb im going to get a lie!
note to self dont make a time machine
Within the Universe reach of understanding
Fun Fact. We CAN travel back in time...We don't know how :P
*makes nanomagentic sonic dimaond
Is this awsome?
Making facts about things not known yet is fun, ain't it?
i make anything
Although there's one issue, the Time line itself needs to be curved. XD

So, are we going to stream the rerun of The Last Roundup as it airs on The Hub?
00,10I usealy finish up a few things before I crash out
Kandarihu: Don't think so
Sumica: Alright, well in case, Sleep well. :)
I'd be surprised we still exist for that long, but yeah, we probably will found out how to do things.
00,10*facehoof*
05who be this?
00,10oh sounds like wrek is looking for OC ideas
Wrek: That sleek look...it's Fluttershy as young, or Lis, or Chrysalis
/me hands Sumica a cup of coffee
Or hooves it over.
Hypper spped
Either word.
hyper speed
Sumica: Can you please stream it? Even just the scene of epicness?
hyper speed
dadasd
wdaawfagrgregerherh
Was I close Wrek?
Heh. Somehow the music became a SFX from Dragonball Z for a few seconds there.
05how should i know? thats why i asked
>.>
00,10Sorry no. I have to keep my bed from flying off during that time and I wont be able to stream the edited rerun of yesterdays eps
SSJ2 ambience
I thought it was a question, not a suggestion, Wrek
Okay Wrek...
Alright, Sumi. Your lose.
/me sips coffee
It's Applehack, the Black sheep of the Apple family that's a computer hacker mechanic geek
HAH!
Bed from flying off???
00,10I think wrek wants you to post OC's cause he's trying to draw a pony
OH!
Draw me!
http://a1.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/551246_298146203587662_100001768545043_737413_170638067_n.jpg
I don't got an OC. So I'm screwed.
00,10correct me if I am wrong wrek
Draw me please?
Then again.. He looks be drawing rather frivilious... Hmm
Nice monicle, Vordox.
Wrek: I want to eat your brain! and gain your drawing powers!!!
Ninjazz: Thank you, Pony.
Pony? I'm but a humble jazz ninja amongst ponies.
00,10carefull Vordox you might end up a mare like me.
Sumica: Okay don't draw me. XD
00,10Oh I dont draw
Your problem is that your name sounds like a girls name.
I already recommend Applehack, the sister mare of Applejack that's a black sheep of the apple family that's a computer mechanic geek :P
Sumica: I forgot you are a mare.
But being a mare OC ain't that bad.
NInjazz: Once I get around I'll make a cull fustom OC of me. in Desktop Ponies. :)
00,10eh it might bug some Ninjazz. I am geting used to it though
Good to know, Sumi.
I'm a mare OC.
Being a mare can be cool! Right?...
Nice, Vordox. Alot of work that is.
I think Wrek's just randomly pitting in what he thinks looks good. :p
Ninjazz: Not really
Ninjazz: Just do the lineart animation done in sprites, rest is easy
Sounds like work to me. :P
Ninjazz: You can make a 8 sprite animation within a day
Ninjazz: And that's a detailed one
Anyway, I gotta get back to my Coding in GML for my Network Game Project. <.<
But that's assuming I know what the hay I need to do to being.
begin*
Ninjazz: It's easier then you thin
Ninjazz: Start low, like 32x32
Perhaps, it always is. >_>
Vordox: GML?
Ninjazz: Then try it out! Who knows you might be as good as Wrek within Freehand within the right resolution in minutes
Game Maker Language
Omg I'm doing a game maker project at the moment too
Hey XAX.
I might try, Vordox. If I get the time.
Twi_Fi! You!
Hello Twi_Fi :3
So... can anypony at least report if derpy comes back.
55 minutes to go.
Ninjazz: I can help you out via skype in case you need a coach =3
Ninjazz: Me?
XAX: Ned a hand ?
Oh, hello everypony.:)
It's alright, man. No need to bother with me.
Hello TheRainbowDash.
Ah sorry on second though I have 3 days on me to make this code compelte. XD
Hey, Dashie.
Vordox: Nah I'm doing ok, thanks.
Hello Ninjazz :)
A 5 week project within 1 and a hal week...is kinda stressfull
Hey, Twi_Fi. Good to see you coming out of hiding.
Ninjazz: Pfft, you give up too easily. :)
Vordox: True story.
:(
Good morning/afternoon/evening/whateverthefuq TheRainbowDash.
XAX: Hahaha, it is morning over here, 7:10 AM
Ninjazz: You have an OC? =3
Yes, I hide here quite regularly.
Nope, I do not. :c
TheRainbowDash: Have the channel?
Ninjazz: Do one for now, just a sketch drawing, accessor, style, colours, mane, tail etc et.
Bronies4evar: Wait, what channel?
Just a sketch
I hear Nittany_Discord is working on getting a stream of Trackmania Nations Forever stream going on here, but I guess it's more complicated than just us all jumping on a server.
I also suck at drawing. :D
Ninjazz: I do too!:D
TheRainbowDash: The one where the new episodes of MLP airs.
Yay! I'm not alone. :)
Ninjazz: I told you, a sketch doesn't have to be uber nce, it's a "this is how I kinda want it to be"
Ninjazz: You can use the Pony Creator instead.
Bronies4evar: Umm, I believe I do have tha channel, actually.
I'm a good drawer.
Wrek: That's Applejack? O.o
This song.....
I wonder if someone might be willing to make FiM-related skins, avatars and horns.
k then...
TheRainbowDash: Can you take a favor?
I see what you're talking about, Vordox.
Bronies4evar: Uhh, sure, whatever it is.
Twi_Fi: What is that, you say?
Oh hai TheRainbowDash!!
Oh, didn't see you there CrazyCherry! (waves and hugs)
/me hugs TheRainbowDash
TheRainbowDash: It's about the rerun at 8:00 am today. It's episode 2.14.
hey TheRainbowDash hows your day been
Bronies4evar: Oh, cool, I'll go check that out.
alexxm: So far, sleepy....I just woke up.
TheRainbowDash: It's about derpy. I think you'd like to tell us all if she comes back to the channel.
XAX: What are you working on? Got a portfolio site? =3
Uhh, sure, about Derpy, umm, don't worry about that.
:)
Vordox: Nah I've only just got into game maker, really.
Wrek, want a challenge on what to draw? :D
She ain't coming back, Bronies4evar.
TheRainbowDash: WAKE UP!
I'm tellin' ya.
XAX: Oh, need anything advanced, I give you suggestion on how to do it. :)
Twi_Fi: I am awake.:P
TheRainbowDash: Dat emoticon.
Who is that Pony? O.o
Woah, that drawing is amazing.
It looks like a blue Wrek.
Is that you Wrek?
Vordox: The teacher doesent expect us to do anything with actual code in GM. we're only doing stuff with built in events and actions
>_>
XAX: Urgh Drag and Drop XD
XAX: Well that is also good. I can handle those good too. :)
Whos streaming now?
XAX: So have anything you need help me today I'll be here all day
CupcakeWarrior: Wrek is.
Hi everypony :$
Hello Irish_Pony|Blind.
If that is the New Wrek. I kinda will steal his picture rightnow. <.<
Hello Irish_Pony|Blind! (waves and hugs) How are you today?:)
What pony is that?
CupcakeWarrior: It seems to be a blue version of Wrek's OC.
TheRainbowDash: I got a new OC :P
Irish_Pony|Blind: Oh, cool! Can you provide me a link to your new OC?
After the scene at 8.04, let us never speak of derpy in that episode again.
Irish_Pony|Blind? Welcome.
Ello there, everypony
Hey Malavolent.
Hello Malavolent.
apparently I can't use the play/pause buttons or adjust volume
Irish_Pony|Blind: Sexy
Irish_Pony|Blind: Whatever could that cutie mark mean?
hey Malavolent hows your day been
Hello Malavolent! (waves and hugs) How are you today?:)
Twi_Fi: :P
and now I can....that was wierd
CupcakeWarrior: :$
I'm quite well, thank you.
Irish_Pony|Blind: And wow, that is absolutely amazing. The cutie mark and the mane/tail are astounding.
Somepony should buy me poker night at the inventory on steam, seeing it's really cheap :D I really want the TF2 items from it...
lol
I kid.
XAX: Oh if you are only kidding....
TheRainbowDash: Ya my friend did a really good job with the colors
I just love them :$
Malavolent: Oh, good to hear! I am well, tired because I just woke up.
Irish_Pony|Blind: Yeah, the 3 color combination on the mane and tail really stand out, and looks awesome.
You know, I suppose the stallions of Equestria could stand to be a bit more manly. However, this is a peaceful kingdom with a female monarch and a prodominantly female population. Masculinity might be a lost cause there.
Malavolent: Ah, hello there, my name is Niko Bellic.:D
omg TheRainbowDash is on :)
Kandarihu: Tell that to Iron Will.
MysteryPony: Hay yeah I am on!
Good point.
I think they just don't show manly stallions in the show much.
Then again it's not so much about being masculine with him. More like "If someone tries to block, show them..." and all that jazz.
Oh hay, I forgot that I need to work on my story, need to get my 5th chapter finished, and complete 3 more chapters by the end of TODAY.

Hey, is there any exact date when S3 should come out?
Hello Tarku.
Nope.
I heard that there was a survey that revealed that what women want in men depends on the times. During times of trouble, women want men who can protect them. During stable times, women want men to be sensitive to their feelings. Equestria is a peaceful kingdom.
But it should be around this summer, shouldn't it?

Whoa, we have N4X and XAX XD

Ninjazz: Uhhh, let me handle that for now.:D
/me sips tea
I throw my hooves up in the air sometimes?
Oh fine... :I
Saying aaaaeeeeyo
As much as I'm loving this music, I'm going to get in trouble for hanging around too much longer. I am NOT suppose to have the stream going on overnight like what happens every night.
Parasprite K.O
Ninjazz: Yeah, you looked really nsane and like a crazy pony. Ponies will think you are a physchopath and will try to kill you.
(insane)
TheRainbowDash: O_O
Well, then...
Ninjazz: So....let me do the waving and what not next time.
what about me TheRainbowDash i do starnger things
I guess I won't have dreams about flying anymore...
Kandarihu: Resistance is futile. You will be assimilated to the night squad.
stranger
alexxm: Nah...nah, I do the most of insane things, but you still act like an insane pony also/
/me hugs TheRainbowDash
It's almost 7:30 am EST now. Th-th-thirty minutes left.
Everything I do is perfectly normal.
alexxm: D'awww...*nuzzles you*
I doubt that, Om.
Om: I think that is completely false. There is no normal way to do something.
Rather, everypony in here and in the world is insane./
Forgetting derpy, Remember last friday when there was a "Rarity pony hour"?
My way is the normal way.
Define normal.
Me.
Today, there will be an Applejack pony hour.
Malavolent: Absolute wrong hay.
Oops, my bad...:D
What Rarity Pony hour?
YES
FUND IT!
I dunno, I don't think anything like normal exist.
Nah, Dashie hour, I will PAY to see that.
Bronies4evar: Where?
Cheese
Luna weekend marathon? Anyone in?
Toast?
Malavolent: Probobly not, but why stress it then eh?
Vordox: Where do ya think? The Hub.
Om: Don't know, just overthinking.
<.< LOL Aj HAS no hour...
Apple
Nothing wrong with that.
/me teaches TheRainbowDash how to do a chokeslam
OH yeah; AJ and Rarity, AJ and everyone following her...THERE is no real focus on AJ anywhere. :(
So that's not possible to have a AJ only hour
alexxm: Uhh, I got my own ways to hurt ponies, it is all ok.
Aye, Vordox. Sad be that.
Very sad.
05this song :3
Too "crunchy" atm..sounds like Dubstep not sure what to do.. :P
You have a very varried music library, Wrek.
Also, has anyone noticed, Dubsteb is probably the easiest genre to make songs for. <.<
Indeed.
sup guys i'm back
Vordox: How so?
F22skyhunter, welcome.
Only thing is easier I can think of the 4 Chord template.
After that Dubstep
Malavolent: Less rules.
For example?
Welcome back F22skyhunter.
The star of today's rerun hour: http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Applejack
hey F22skyhunter hows your day been
Bronies4evar: Applejack is meh in my eyes.
Malavolent: Less focus on filling, less concentration of notes with more outdrown moments within the stretches
Bronies4evar: Wikia is the best pony.
Not sure on the terms. :P
alexxm: nice thanks i'm about continue my mlp comic
TheRainbowDash: Remember.... 8.04 am.
Theres a damn picture I'm trying to get for you, Dashie. BUT I CAN'T FREAKIN FIND IT!
Vordox: I think i understand, and I agree.
whats it about F22skyhunter
05>crunchy >mentions dubstem instead of sphycadelic hardcore
Bronies4evar: Yeah, got it.
Malavolent: Doesn't mean it's bad, don't get me wrong
05>mfw
Wrek: Dubstep can be called alot :P
Vordox: I don't like it, so I don't care about that. :D
I clearly hear "wubs" in that song
Hey is this your OC Wrek?
Dubstep is the (wubwubwub) stuff, becasue Scratch told me it was.:D
05hell no
Just asking :D
Dubstep is probably the hardest genre also to point somewhere. <.<
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4156 TheRainbowDash
Is it Photo Finish Wrek?
Keep your fingers (hooves) crossed for her.
The hair just reminded me
Proper dubstep atleast.
I hear wubs, where they stretch a note with vibrations within a electrical synth part, Wrek ><
alexxm: Uhh, o...k....
I should probably unmute sounds, I have no idea what are you talking about.
Finally found it.
what TheRainbowDash
TheRainbowDash: Heres your Rainbow Dash hour.
http://i.imgur.com/JDErk.png
o_o
O_O
o_o
O_O
sounds intresting F22skyhunter
Malavolent: Now it's another song
Ninjazz: YES! Absolutely amazing, I would pay to see that show, if it exists, and hopefully, it does.:)
It seems like every second person here writes a fanfic.
Fund it, Dashie.
I AM CREATING A network GAME for my game project that will have a ...a...utställning...Exhibition!
alexxm: the atmosphere would be something like this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QaVsMBJzaU&feature=channel&list=UL
Malavolent: Yeah I already completed one, working on a 2nd one. And I will fund that show Ninjazz, big stuff,.
;)
You never told me about those revisions, TheRainbowDash.
It's interesting how many people do fandom for this show.
I miss Invi...
Malavolent: Bear in minds I am a Rarity fan.
You can thank me for a couple, Irish_Pony|Blind.
*lets out a long moan and scratches ass* hey every one
Malavolent: This is not a game with ponies, that's the Flash Project I am working on
Ninjazz: Ummm, oh right! The revisions are pretty cool, and I'll implement some of them in my story, but again, not my style, so not all (descriptive wrods and flow of sentence words) wil exactly make it.
Ninjazz: Well you don't see many Rarity fans nowadays. ;)
http://e621.net/data/5e/5e/5e5e52abf27b6013b71c018fd9ea951a.png
Malavolent: AJ got still more then AJ :P
f
Rarity and AJ there, derp
TheRainbowDash: I kept most of your word structure in tact.
Vordox: Wait, what?
Rarity has more fans then AJ
Oh, better.
Malavolent: Indeed. :(
But everyone doesn't hate AJ.
Ninjazz: Oh, I saw that. 75% of the stuff is still the same.
Don't you just hate it when you think faster then you act?
People tend to hate Rarity.
#alexxm
My favourite three ponies are already clear, AJ would be 4th.
Why, both are fine, really
Rarity, Applejack, A rivalry.
?
Wut?
what did you make Irish_Pony|Blind ?
05the reallyt defining difference is that this feels like an actual song
What Wrek?
I don't think I show how much of a fan of Pinkie Pie I am.
Oh come on are we again in the best pony argue?
N4X: Nah
But yeah, third place is pretty open to anyone who can impress me the msot.
Crackle is best pony
We're talking about the fans behind the ponies.
Oh well then...
Okay, I am CERTAIN that's not a Wrek pony anymore. :P He's not a PEgasus
Wonder how many Celesria fans are out there.
Irish_Pony|Blind: thats pretty damn cool
She sure does deserve more fans.
Celestia* damnit.
Malavolent: There's less Celestia fan then Trollestiia :P
And Wrek is giving himself some wings.....
Celestia is one of my faveorite ponies.
I always wondered why Luna got a bigger Fan base than Celestia
Vordox: Or Molestia. Poor Celestia, she is neither cute or villain to be favourite.
Twenty minutes till rerun hour.
Cause Luna isn' perfect.
N4X i think its because she was a villian and its because of the way she talked
Bronies4evar http://www.flickr.com/photos/markluethi/5594972041/
The royal Canterlot voice? :D
N4X ya that voice :P
N4X: What about the voice? (screaming in your face):D
God I once saw a video...fluff such an earra..
/me is blown away by the volume
HIYA EVERYPONY
I don't even...
Hey Bronysith!
hey Bronysith
Hello Bronysith! (waves and hugs) How are you today?:)
hey Bronysith hows your day been
Watching Wrek drawing wings, I've read that female pony's wing lenght is equal to breast size in humans.
Wow...now that's a giant wing
good alexxm (Hugs TheRainbowDash )
WHAT?!
I hope you understand that sentence.
Malavolent: huuuuu
Where the hell did you read that Malavolent?!
Wow dude...celestia
Malavolent http://www.flickr.com/photos/markluethi/5594972041/ i'll just leave this here
I've read it somewhere, don't remember where. Don't know if it even was official.
Bronies4evar: Ah, cool to hear! Just woke up about 45 minutes ago, but then I realized I have to finish 3 chapters by the end of today.
Irish_Pony|Blind Wow "a Walk in the woods" is simply magnificent!
N4X :$
Malavolent: I doubt the hub would say something like that.
Ohei Bronystate!
Also, someone said that Derpy has the longest wings.
hey MadSurge
Time is... 7:48 am.
It kinda makes sense to me.
Hypotetical question, do you think that female ponies with longer wings are considered more attractive?
Those are some huge-ass wings o__o
OH my... Dem wings
Woah, them wings....o_o
Geez...
Hello MadSurge.
You aren't jealous, are you, RD? :D
i think the wings are just about right :)
Hey Twi_Fi!
Malavolent : I guess it depends on your definition of "attractive"
N4X: Well, attractive to stallions.
It's not like every Stallion is as...fuck don't know how to say it in English...as desperatly horny as some other humans
-.-
Malavolent: Uhhh, maybe I am jealous bro...:|
Any German here that could help me?
hey Madsurge http://www.flickr.com/photos/markluethi/5594972041/ i'll just leave this here
N4X: Try google traslate?
Its not the best...
hey MadSurge http://www.flickr.com/photos/markluethi/5594972041/ i'll just leave this here
It's a neologism I don't think it would work out pretty well
N4X sexually atrracted?
Irish_Pony|Blind: Uhh, I would think that also.
Time is... 7:54 am.
naw...notgeil a known term? I guess not huh?
N4X: Got the same problem. I mean, male humans are attracted to females with larger breasts (true story), so stallions may or may not be attracted to females with longer wings.
whos N4X attracted to Irish_Pony|Blind
alexxm: Stop leaving that picture here....:(
The hell?!
Wait, what
Wait, what?:D
what Twi_Fi
alexxm: Dat statue
alexxm: It scares me.....
alexxm nopony, in fact i have no idea :P
alexxm: that's a creepy statue :D and we didn't have Mr Rogers' Neighbourhood
I like how the wings are much taller than the pony's overall height.
sorry Twi_Fi
7:55 am. Show begins in five minutes.
Do you think he can beat you in a race, TheRainbowDash ?
TheRainbowDash: http://lifeofpixels.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Bald-Eagle3.jpg
Twi_Fi: Eh, not a chance!
TheRainbowDash: it looks a bit out of proportions, doesn't it?
/me hugs Twi_Fi sorry about the statute
alexxm: :)
Malavolent: Oh wow, never thought of hawks also.
Nature is funyn.
^
what do you think makes it creepy MadSurge
MadSurge: Much out of proportion. I don't even think that is possible.
Dat Foo Fighters Remix
Time is... Seven... fifty-seven... am.

Bronies4evar: End of messaging.:D

Appropriate music to the countdown :D
N4X: Typing with chips seems pretty difficult to me.
8:00! It begins. AJ pony hour!
Nice song, Wrek.
I meant "it" you can type with your nose :D
okay...
forget it
:D
05no one here knows foo fighters?
But Derpy is on the episode, just with a different voice :/
I do.
I do Wrek
This is the Pretender.
N4X: I get it, I'm just kidding you :D
I have heard of such a band.
yes you can N4X
;D
Whoever is on the hub now will see this in two minutes. http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120124232316/mlp/images/3/32/Derpy_Hooves_Thundercloud_2_S2E14.png
Probably the edited version.
Bronies4evar: You're in serious need for your daily pony dose, aren't you?
Wrek: do u do any drawing requests?
Don't get your hopes up. It already began. Right?
Wrek: cause i would love it if u drew dinky
I know Jack Black is great friends with Foo Fighters' singer :D
Amy Keating Rogers...thank you for the small amount of time you granted us with Derpy
8:02 am. Two minutes to go!
Bronies4evar: wheres this happening?
HUB?
Guys don't beat me but I like the new Derpy voice better. Although the other features of her should remain the same.
On The Hub.
The HUB shows ponies!
90 secs.
2 more hours
Ohmahgosh
Twi_Fi: i wonder if Wrek s drawn a dinky
Bronies4evar: for wut?
Shane377_The_Alicorn: Not sure.
well to be fair Malavolent i heard the person who orignally voiced derpy thought she was a guy
Sixty seconds until she may come back!
Wrek: New wallpaper? That seducing Twi...
/me sighs
Wrek: have u drawn a dinky before?
Malavolent: Nah, the new voice is fine. Its the act of changing it that got everyone a bit edgey
Malavolent: does the voice really matter? She was recognized by the show! :$
On this note I shall be getting to work on stuff.
In thirty seconds, you will see if I am right.
MadSurge : You mean WE were recognized by the show :D
alexxm: Yep, she thought she voices a boy I think.
15 to go.
With her new voice Derpy sounds just like a stereotypical stupid blonde.
Derpy isn't a boy? :P
What's it gonna say!

Nope?
N4X, she was the frosting on the cake :)
Bronies4evar, so, what's the word?
Well, Bronies4evar ?

Derpy what?
*DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUN*
ACS131123 ?
Scene is over now. Now... we wait.
But I still think that Derpy should have the voice she has in Doctor Whooves and Assistant.
N4X: I have NO idea...
It fits her quite well.
...
What is downloading??
05might aswell download rubicon
Ehm...the voice was by Balddumborat,wasn't it?
We need elevator music.
Jeopardy theme :D
No this music is mellow.
One minute passed, no info.
N4X: Yep.
We can't change the past, so let's hope for the best.
Two minutes passed, no info.
I WANT CAKE!!!
I already know what
THE CAKE IS A LIE!
has happened. I'm not hoping for anything.
/me steams N4X`s Cake!
N4X: It is now.
Three minutes passed, still no info.
Downloading all of Avatar (the cartoon), can't wait to watch it!
The suspense is killing me!
Hey...i wanted to eat that...

Yes, that derpy is back?
http://bronies.memebase.com/2012/05/19/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-d-is-the-only-answer/
Bronies4evar: Well, Derpy is back.
OH GOD!

Censored or not?
Nightmare moon...
Really?
Needs more Luna.
/me passes a bottle of whiskey to MysteryPony
Oh, I forgot that Nightmare even existed.
Yes...
TheRainbowDash is derpy censored
05no one knows the music? good
/me fills a wine glass with Whiskey! passes the bottle back!
alexxm: I believe so..:(
Wrek is best hipster
high voice derpy or depy derpy?
MysteryPony : Like a sir
Wrek: I guess we all listen to mainstream.
The only nightmare i fear is my ex girlfriend :P
Five minutes after the scene, STILL no specific derpy info.
RainbowAsh: I am a hipster, and I do not approve of that.
was the name derpy mentioned TheRainbowDash
/me drinks the whiskey, Like a sir!
Yes, it was the "new" derpy voice
is it high girl voice derpy or?
...
alexxm: Uhhh, I guess yes.
05that means there's a less chacne peopel will recognize what i got planned
Oh, did TheRainbowDash return?
hey Twi_Fi
Twi_Fi: Eeyup, with my noms.:)
TRD: Censored or not?
Wrek: is it a game?
The changed derpy
Wrek what? you planning to rape us with G3?
Wrek... Marathon... All is clear.
Wrek: is it cake! i want cake!
Hey Shane377_The_Alicorn.
If I caught that right
Bronies4evar: Unforuantely, yes.
hey hey Twi_Fi
Hey hey Shane377_The_Alicorn.
TheRainbowDash: so its retarded voice derpy
YAY!
Can I ruin the surprise, Wrek? :P
Shane377_The_Alicorn: Pretty much.
TheRainbowDash, I am sorry if I have hurt your feelings, that wasn't my intention.
Twi!
TheRainbowDash: wahh i want hte normal derpy
Dat twilight...
The RP dont start til TheRainbowDash Walks in!
awww
05never
Okay. I knew it was not going to happen. I just wanted to give people hope.
w8 so the the girl voice one is the uncensored or the censored?
MysteryPony: Awww snap! RP Dash is in the house!:D
You are a good Brony Bronies4evar
Why are you talking about Derpy all of sudden?
Derpy is now canon
Malavolent: well cos derpy is a pony ofc
Malavolent, because TLR is playing on the hub
w8 so the the girl voice one is the uncensored or the censored? TheRainbowDash
Malavolent: It is because of the episode that showed Derpy talk and what not, but it was censored. Some ponies in this chatroom do not have the channel.
Oh ho ho that slaps me on the knee!
Still, was it the old scene or the new one.
Shane377_The_Alicorn: I am sorry to report that it is censored.
-_-
So, it's rerun of The Last Roundup?
05some=majority
They already showed the damn episode here...
true...
Shane377_The_Alicorn, the original had a deeper, somewhat slow voice. The new standard girly issue voice is the new one.
TheRainbowDash: so its the retard voice one not the girl voice?
:O
ohhh ok
/me facehoofs
Shane377_The_Alicorn: Ummm, I have to check if the retarded one is the girl one, but most likely so.
brb
Okay. It was a long shot anyway. Let's just enjoy the AJ pony hour.
RainbowAsh: so the retarded one is the original
Censored=new New= Girly Voice
Bladdra :D
right?
Svensker er så rare!!!
Shane377_The_Alicorn, it's not that retarded, but in a nutshell, yes.
My chat derped.
MysteryPony: english do you speak it
any1 got utube link of new derpy ep ?
RainbowAsh: its how i differentiate them
Derpy is not retarded guys, stop dissing her
alexxm: Да, я делаю!
As far as I know, there is the old voice (Where she sounds like a retard) and the new one (Where she has high voice).
Who is dissing Derpy?
WHO?
Nopony should do it
Twi_Fi: Wait, huh?
I am too busy nomming on stuff.
TheRainbowDash, you have entered the door to the north. You are now by yourself, standing in a dark room. The pungent stench of mildew emanates from the wet dungeon walls.
It's over. Derpy is dead. Let's just hope for a derpy episode in Season 3.
Among other things, Dashie.
DUDE! Bronies4evar!
Bronies4evar: :(
Bronies4evar: :'(
Derpy isn't dead she was in several other episodes even after the last roundup!
TBH making derpy have that girly voice makes it seem worse cause derpy has blonde hair so yea
Mutterguy: Oh, what is that smell? (closes my nose, and I notice a small, but faint window in the far corner of the dark room, and one pony enters the room with me)
For example a friend in deed (i think)
11.•10«11WB10 (Lighty10) 11WB10»11•. 10- i sooo love e-mail, i win atleast 5 cars everyday
Derpy cant die. She was alive before she was even canon
Shane377_The_Alicorn, ikr
Talking derpy is never coming back. :(
DERPY IS NOT DEAD. She's alive and well, it's just very unlikely she'll get another talking role
Bronies4evar: DONT SAY THAT! *starts Crying*
it seems they kinda MADE IT WORSE than better
I'm confused.
MadSurge: Yeah, Derpy is not dead, obviously, whow would think that?
What did happen?
cause now its picking on blondes
Wrek, what'cha doing? =3
Bucking fluff! Bronies4evar : Stop this nonesense it's helping no pony
05setting up
I said TALKING derpy, not derpy alltogeher.
D3?
but tbh i dont really mind derpys new voice
We don't know!
If my predictions are correct, Wrek is about to show a classic.
We got a whole fandom backing and loving Derpy, and the animators know that :)
Wrek: have u or are u gonna draw a dink picture?
Wrek: why do you have swedish operating system?
****NO DERPY POSTS AFTER THIS LINE*******
I stayed up half the night last night for a live stream on a game, only to fall asleep 20 minutes into it :P
I don't think Wrek can draw fillies that well. :)
Because it's over.
Unless he proves me wrong atleast.
I do not care if Derpy's voice is changed, I just want her to remain of the same and orginal character that she was before.
I know that feel, Cypresswolf.
I do what I want. Derpy
TheRainbowDash: is such a derp-y pony
ohai bronystate! :D
Dem Swedish folders

Om: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4314/
MadSurge: No, she (I) am well, straight. And that ends right now.
he liked it but wouldn't say he was a brony Cypresswolf
I have seen a large decrease in lesbian RD jokes recently.
TheRainbowDash: u would like this one http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4885/
I am disappoint.
Twi_Fi: Good.:|
:D
Twi_Fi: and thank god for that!
Shane377_The_Alicorn: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/907/
Eh. I'd rather just see more Friendshippinh with Dash. Always straight to the hardcore stuff with her.
did the game just freeze?
Shane377_The_Alicorn: Just...wow...(facehoof and nods in dissapointment of you)
I have a very crude drawing of a comic based off Noah's Ark with Rainbow Dash providing the Rainbow after it stopped raining :)
I missed the end of Hitchikers yesterday, how was it?
haha TheRainbowDash
Shane377_The_Alicorn: That Applejack and Rainbow Dash pic is epic!
lol Twi_Fi '\
i liked it Kattchips-pony hows your day been
Twi_Fi : I guess every joke is used till it isn't funny anymore remember this whole : "Arrow to the knee thing" becoming more and more popular till everyone was sick of it
Two Pistols.
Where are all the enemies in this game? :D
Pew pew pew
it only took a month N4X
The fun has been DOUBLED!!
If I can get it to look better, I may eventually post it somewhere
Twi_Fi: No, it is not epic. I rather hate it.
alexxm: Not bad.
It's 8:30 am. The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000 is playing on the hub now.
oh btw when i watched Avengers today it reminds me of Return of Harmony :\
Man, I wish I finished Marathon.
Actually you are a bit right, valoreins.
It kinda did...
haha!!
WOAH
Yeah, I remember the whole arrow in the knee jokes plague.
I havent seen Avengers yet.
Ninjazz|Work: Oh, the New York marathon is in 2 weeks, and you still haven't completed it in over 15 years? Wow, you are sooo slow...:D
It was a pest...
Loki=Discord? 6_9
TheRainbowDash: O U. :D
it only took a month for people to be sick of them Twi_Fi
Ninjazz|Work: Oh me...(smiles)
Wasn't Loki actually a dwarf who fooled the gods...?
TheRainbowDash:
TheRainbowDash: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2479/
I was scared when I kept seeing those Arrow in Knee jokes because I wasn't sure of the source and it seemed like everyone on youtube was making the same joke.
I didn't know those soldiers could have Assualt Rifles...
Shane377_The_Alicorn: Ummm...o_o...there is the tag "rule 34" under it, maybe not so apporpiate in here.

Bronysith: Tbh. Not all of them.
Run (though the) Forrest RUN!
Bronysith: The first ones were pretty funny.
Lol swedish?
Beacuse episode 2.15 aired at 8.30 am after what we were all anxious about at 8.00.
Dat fake slap

Bronysith: If you want truly abysmal, watch Meet the Spartans.
Take it!
That is honestly the worst movie I've paid to watch.
Stab that pig.
Destroy him!
What is this?
Defence rating is 0.
Ninjazz, you are paying for watching this movie?o_O

Bronysith: I'm not too sure you should... :$
Eh, get over it, weakling.:|
You're a warrior boy! Get courage!
Bronysith: You know... You might right about that.
It's about 9.30 pm here.
Ninjazz|Work: seriously. maybe it is meant for like pre teens and children.
No, Radu. I was talking about going to the theatres and paying to watch them. Meet the Spartans I mean.
Oh, I thought you were talking about this movie
Oooo, fancy.
It isn't bad, actually.
Bronysith: Alot of the humor suited the rather crude side comedy, so I agree.
That feel when you spill something but you can't tell where the spell is.
i am om nomming on a rice krispy treat
spell? spill*
Ninjazz|Work: so middle school shits
As if I'm casting magic with tea.
Bronysith: Yeah, basically.
Bronysith: CNIBAL!
Samurai Jack
WHO WANTS A KRISPY TREAT?
Meanwhile: You're casting tea magic!
Wrek: do u want one
05one what?
Wrek: a rice kirspy treat
Krispy Treat
You need tea leaves for tea magic and I use tea bags.
Do you know why today' rerun hour can be called an Applejack pony hour?
Hint: Krispy Treat is poison
Meanwhile: That will only yield low-grade spells at best.
Radu: filled with delicious cyanide

/me stares shocked at pikorar .... 10:15.. AM? AT A SUNDAY?! WHAT ARE YOU?!
You never seem to stop doing that, huh GilDash?
Wrek, What are you gonna stream next?
Airpuff: I am a boy whose parents were about to drag to church.
Airpuff: Under the influence of me. ;)
Airpuff: Is 10:19PM here :P
HE CAN'T SERVE WHEN HE'S BEEN EXCOMMUNICATED
pikorar: ... ouch
Airpuff: but I had too much French work to complete and had to stay home.
Ninjazz|Work: No, I'm quite proud of myself. :)
Eh, French is easy...
I'm athiest. My parents don't know yet and they won't until I leave the house.
pikorar: Better safe than sorry.
pikorar: i see. x)
Well, good for you, GilDash. Hope you break your records every day.
Ninjazz|Work: You shouldn't. :D
Well, I'll be heading off to church in about 12 minutes... at least I'm supposed to. It almost never works out that well.
:D
Ninjazz|Work: Don't encourage him.
GilDash: what records are you planning on breaking?
GilDash: ... what records? xD
05you have my condolences Kandarihu
Om: I don't think he needs my encouragement.
I'm not sure I should comment on them. :D
GODSPEED Kandarihu!
pikorar: Oh, you. :)
Ninjazz|Work: Better safe then sorry. Eh?
Wrek: What are you streaming next?
have FUN, Kandarihu.
wow, I can't connect to Steam?
/me stares at GilDash ...... "lul" =P
Thanks
Om: Indeed.
Now we are back to the beginning?
Kandarihu: My condolences.
Airpuff: Records we could break together. ;)
HOLY MARMALADE OF SWEET SUGARY GOODNESS
Every movie with swords needs more lightsabers and/or master swords and/or keyblades. That's just my professional opinion.
/me blushes "Oh you GilDash "
pikorar: this is true
pikorar: Keyblades for sure.
pikorar: What about katanas?
pikorar: Katana, Scimtar?

xXiaoDrag0n: Yeah, but my RP is limited to a sense.
TheRainbowDash: god knows -.- xD

WallDives: Holla! :)
Hello WallDives! (waves and hugs) How are you today?:)
Hello WallDives! I love you!
Its WallDives
so tired.
pikorar: That's okay, they're using an industrial toaster.
Om: Nothing's unusual about it, why?
Hello WallDives.
pikorar: I clean my toaster and and what not, why implement these unjust laws?
xXiaoDrag0n: Tast can cure any illness.
Ooh, GilDash. That... Right there, that was very clever.
WallDives: Oh, you tired? (hugs you for comfort)
Om: Tast or Toast you mean
has anybody died yet?
all toast, toast toasts!
pikorar: Even I have my moments. :)
Ooo

TheRainbowDash: What are you trying to do to me? :D
dafuq
Nah, I hate My Little Pony, GilDash. I'm just a brony because I hate myself.
TheRainbowDash: me
Ummm....I do.:D

pikorar: All that frustration you hold... you need a release. ;)
xXiaoDrag0n: Oh, how is it not cool?
Saladin Salad > Caeser Salad.

I said it sarcastically Airpuff :C

Bronysith: Woah, drugged?
TheRainbowDash: what
ME! Ooh! Pick me Bronysith! ME!
TheRainbowDash: You scared him off.

/me gives pikorar drugged goodies

GilDash: Don't complain.
Bronysith: Nah, I am good, I got 10 cans of Naughty G right beside me :D

Om: Wait, I did? My bad...:D
/me giggles at pikorar "Gotta love taking people on their word knowing they were sarcastic" x)
05GilDash cause they speak a total of 5 languages in this movie
WOOOO!!!
/me eats drugged goodies and is alltogether unaffected.

Wrek: Oh, okay then. :S
Aw, ya got me then, Airpuff?
5 languages ftw!
GilDash: I've heard sweedish, norwegian and english so far =P
/me doesn't complain for Om.
05and latin and arabic
Airpuff: Okay... >_<
pikorar: i guess ;)
why no mandarin lol
First time for everything.
05i dunno
Hmmm, lockpicking skils have increased by 1.
Nonns.. they punish in the name of god... seems legit..
why do they have to punish her
English spanish german and italian are the only ones i know ._.
Actually, I speak Boomhower English.
pikorar: I know British English... and that's it. :D
GilDash: Wow, really?:D
british english <3 the queens english and yeah
GilDash: heres some drugged goodies
You mean Commonwealth English, GilDash? That's what it's called.
GilDash: No other languages? xd
I am fluent in English, I know a little dutch and japanese.
Why is there different types of styles for one language anyway?
Bronysith: Where are you getting all thsese drugged items?
TheRainbowDash: regional dialects.
/me drugs Om
pikorar: I've never heard of it called that. :D
and don't forget Engrish!
i come back to this
Oh they took him.
ffs.
WallDives: Oh, forgot about accents of different people and what not.
/me gets dizy and falls over
/me helps Om back up on his feet
TheRainbowDash: Cause each other things there own lanuage is better, duh...
/me eats a carrot
thinks*
@~@
GilDash: http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Commonwealth_English that's the official name of it.
TheRainbowDash: right. in other languages, like Arabic, the differences in dialects is like the difference between Italian and French.
wat happen to the baby?
I'd like to learn Spanish, but I don't think I can be assed. :D
_xXiaoDrag0n_: Oh, yeah, forgot that too.
can someone tell me what is this were watching so interesting :)
Om its not nice to ask where people got their drugs just accept and say thank you
:O <-- This doesn't adequately represent my shock!
pikorar: Oh, well everyone I know just calls it British English. The more you know!
GilDash: You'll get far enough with english, dont mind learning any more xDD
[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn: The hasent have it yet @~@
Twi_Fi: :)
French and English. Bilingual.
Well then, GilDash, you can impress all your British English friends with Commonwealth English.
TheRainbowDash: Mandarin is a headache all its own.
pikorar: And confuse them when I talk exactly the same how I do now. :D
Im bilingual too.
Hey... Is there anyone here who is not a natural born English speaker who can answer a question for me?
Om what? :P
TheRainbowDash: Mandarin is a Chinese Dialect.
WallDives: Oh, yeah, there is also another "Chinese" form of it, but I forgot what it was, but it is about all the same thing.
How come there's a film on so early?
Yes, Pikorar?
... you'know.. its kinda creepy that they think "god" justifyes their madness xD
what the films name i wanna know
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0837106/
what is*
_xXiaoDrag0n_: Yeah, I know, I just wanted to know if there was other dialects for that specific language.
05becasue swedish films are so bad they are good
Demathil, all my friends claim that English is one of the hardest languages to learn, which I don't believe at all. Do you think English was a difficult language?
That would make it a B movie Wrek
nah this film is relevant to my interest
what are we watching?
pikorar: it is actually one of the easiest languages on earth.
And what film is this?
^ this please! ish
Hey, and good thanks TheRainbowDash, and yourself?
TheRainbowDash: Some chinese dialect I heard of are, Hokkien, Teochew, Mandarin, Cantonese
pikorar: You should try to speak finnish... It's like japanese but backwards....
Languages are hard.
GilDash: I guess... still.. Its redicolus
Thank you Dermathil. I now have two people telling me the same thing. English has so few rules it's easy to pick up.
CrazyCherry: that thought scares me.
I thought we we're done with movies for the week
Airpuff: Welcom to life. :)
GilDash: Welcome to religion* I'd say. Bunch of nonsense -.-
WallDives: :D :3
Airpuff: Additional "e"s in "Welcome" cost extra. :D
Oh god a wip
:O
what are we watching?
Actually CrazyCherry, Acleps taught me a little Finnish, and I know how crazy it can be. But I'm taking French and that's already too much for my babby brain to handle.
:O:O
RUN for the HILLS!
xD GilDash
Airpuff: It's not always religion. Look at extremest movements in environment and such.
Can't tell if kinky or not...
Pikorar: French is infinitely harder.
what are we watching?
:O:O:O
IshBestPony: Arn.
05S&M the medieval
Ah, hold up everypony, got to reboot my system, I'll be on right after I restart.
GilDash: True. But look troughout world history.
pikorar: Good for you! :D :3
so, is this castle Anthrax?
Damn, that's loud.
Dermathil: Oh God yes... With the conjugatios and masculine/feminine... Man.
ouch
:(
Dayum.
That's my natural born language btw.
:(
:C I'm a sad panda.
pikorar: yes you are.
And guys, the sound of a whip is caused by the whip going supersonic.
How kind the grace of god is. [sarcasm]
pikorar: You're a panda?
Why do nuns have to be so cruel and unjust?
Airpuff: I know. That's because God and faith have always been amongst the most predominant issues. Now that more and more people do not believe you'll see others taking their place.
pikorar: they are bitches that never got to get laid. Ever.
Cause god told them so i guess thats how they see it
What movie is this?
Ello.
"god is loving but he also told me to whip you for speaking your mind"
They worship satan in their evil black garb and listen to their heavy metal at all hours of the night.
Wait, I thought we we're done with movies for the week
Hey Princess_Cadence.
/me makes a poor attept at licking her elbow\
Hi Princess_Cadance! I love you!
IshBestPony: dont question it, just enjoy it.
pikorar thank you
To an extent, valoreins.
GilDash: True. Still, the fact that as long as they did it in the name of god or as "god's will" earlier justified anything is just fucked up.
Hey Dermathil
You should have seen the Spanish Inquisition valoriens. Much worse.
05the master nun being a bitch? probably not accurate
how are you man?
05in general
Not bad thanks, you?
/me is so worried that sweats
Airpuff: Also true, but people can go to absurd lengths in "justifying" their actions.
I'm feeling okay. Bit depressed here and there, but cool.
:S will it happen? : S :S
alexxm: So far there hasn't been much of it. :P
Aw, why Dermathil? You can talk about it!
/me falls over
here-
Dermathil: Aww, I don't like depressed ponies. :(
isnt-
will it happen?!?! :S :S :S *sweats*
GilDash: yeah yeah, true. But religion has always been one of the first "legitimate" reasons.
everypony vote: swords or guns?
Dermathil: I hope you find some solace in being here at bronystate.
Hiya everypony!
swords please
Airpuff: *Sigh* Yeah... :(
hey TheMonstaMuffin.
valoreins: swords take more skill, but guns are quicker, and get the job done.
INB4 Armand dies
:P
hi themonstamuffin
Hi Ninjazz
Yeah, I'm an athiest and athiests just justify that they can do whatever they want!

/me hugs WallDives
hey TheMonstaMuffin hows your day been
Greetings PrincessLuna.
wrek lol
Airpuff: I just don't like people saying religion is the root of all wars and the like. Just like how I don't like saying all bronies are attracted to horses or whatnot.

Thank you, GilDash.
Good morning Om :)
/me pokes GilDash
Ninjazz|Work: For what? :S
05i would definetly be religious if it meant being a paladin
05;3
GilDash: I understand that, but if you look objectively at it... it is one of the main reasons to many wars and alot of suffering -.-
and templars being jerks, is that historically accurate too? :s
05a giant hammer and the holy light is all i need
hey PrincessLuna hows your day been (hugs her)
i knew it i knew i just kneew itt
Your statement earlier to Airpuff, not alot of sense is made in these days.
I would worship shruberies to be a knight of ni.
And no sins of the flesh either Wrek
Airpuff: No, people abusing power is. Religion is a justification and a scapegoat, nothing more.
05valoreins: you mistake the templar beign a jerk with the MAN being aj erk
Hey this is 'Arn' isent it?
valoreins: probably, since all templars are are knights, and historically, they're just as prickish as lords.
alexxm: Well I'm just finishing my coffee but good :)
okay
bad news.i will be gone until its june 5th.
Ninjazz|Work: Yeah, I try to be as open-minded as I can. :)
Why?

Airpuff: They will continue to as well for as long as they hold the power. :(
Princess_Cadence: I hope everything goes well for you.
/me hugs Princess_Cadence.
Princess_Cadence: Wow, that sounds serious. I hope you get better soon. From me, personally, and all of bronystate, get well soon.:) (hugs you)

No Gods, no kings. Only man.

Richard the third.
alexxm: You know what I mean >.>
-cared nothing for that part of the class- xD

Lol,
TERA is interesting
Silly WallDives. Mean ponies do bad things because they can.
Just too Asain
i.e Armor Thong and bikini
Lord: so not good
Nah,
alexxm: I don't know about you, but I was raised where that behavior is not comendable.
it's a action MMORPG
guild wars 2 anyone?
i said i was sorry Om
Kattchips-Pony: this is true. Oh well.
...all the spam protectiomn :c...
wait what did saladin had to do with mmorpg kain xD
MMOs are the bane of gaming.
confused now
someone asked about TERA. it's a MMORPG
I thought COD was the bane of gaming.
alexxm: I forgive you xD I just like to be harsh~
05the bane of gaming is publishers
^
oh derp sorry only readin what pops up on your names
reading*
COD at least doesn't use psychological methods to render you addicted.
Game Publishers are the bane of gaming
Om: I like harse too. ;)
*harsh
True.
Ahaha GilDash
It fine sweetie~ x3 -he snuggles morningburst-
game players are the bane of gaming.
:3
GilDash: I think we mean deffernt things ._.

Om: Probably. :D
on the third day, look to the easat
I don't think an army has ever lost with the sun at its back.
Om very much probably... xD
LOTR going down here.
GilDash: Probably?
Defeinetyl

05haha yeah dari
GilDash: I hade enough "excitement" geting booted into a shower.
ive seen this 100's of times
Dermathil: Horses don't carry swords.
God wills it
KILL THE HORSE, THE RIDER FALLS AND IS CRUSHED
:'(:'(
don't kill the horses theyre gorgeous
</3
/me exciteds
Well, that's a sword they're never getting back.
Meanwhile, the horse gives the enemy the advantage of mobility.
Don worry. Just god who decided that you should die. No need to fight it lol
s
Look at my horse.
let's mourn for the horses instead
/me teaches Om how to do a piledriver
My hore is amazin'
yes mourn the horses
forget the humans
*Horse
Om: If you're excited maybe you need a cold shower. ;)
idc for the humans xD
05we are not fleeing, we are strategically rearranging ourselves for future battles.
Dermathil: And the enemy gives the enemy the advantage of being an enemy. A horse without a rider will just as soon abandon the battlefield.
alexxm: When will I need to use this?
xD.
What are we watching?
in a fight Om
ive been asking that question all morning xd
GilDash: And risk intrusion? Not likely.
05we are watching http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0837106/
We are not fleeing, we are just charging in the opposite direction
alexxm: I'm a pacifist...
"Sir, we're surrounded!!!!!!!" "Excellent, that means we can attack in any direction" Wrek
we're watching monkey kill each other

0,5IRl matters come first
Erryday ahm error.
ERROR 37 xD
whats diablo 3 about anyway
all the errors
dat error 37
Om sounds epic. x)
Lord: THat'S because the main assets are serverside. That way they can't pirate the fullgame.
0,5because if we dont take care of things in real life, there's less chance we get to enjoy ponies
alexxm: one giant murder simulateor
GilDash: I can be a tad careless at times...
Airpuff: Epic?
sounds good Bronysith
It's a series of tubes.
I know, it's rather shitty. Blizzard is all about the money nowdays
You NEED to connect to have access to the enemy spawn and stuff
Om: I refuse to argue my reasons because people don't listen to them. :)
tis quite sad.
Om: remains to be proven xD
05good thing i was prepared
Om: I simply walk away and move on. :)
alexxm: seriously every single enemy seems squishy
hubby i'll brb i'm starving
is there nothing but money for game industry today...
alright sweetheart~
alexxm: and u fight massive armies of hell
GilDash: Try me! xD
Lord: It always has been. People who say otherwise are trapped in their fantasy.
GilDash: Makes sense.
Wrek: what level are u now?
That is true
0534 iirc
you had me at murder Bronysith
Airpuff: I don't get it...
Airpuff: ... In what way should I try you? ;)

Lord: I can do a ninja cameo in any stream. (LOOK BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER!!!)
And back after my shower. I am super clean now, so no need for dusting me off when Maid Hour hits.

I still wonder if Wizard's as annoying on Hell difficulty as it was for Sorceror in D2.
GilDash: not really.. not if one already knows the answer more or less ;)

Om: I can't have you stood there dripping like that. :(
dammit, i should have wrote an article about NES, but then i got high
GilDash: Eh, that is nothing. I cleaned multiple universes, in one second.
Airpuff: You didn't have to point it ou.

Nyria: wondered how many times you were going to talk without tildes.
Hey Ninjazz|Work~
Hmmm, I remember that I have to do something...something important...
lol the other guy just.... lookin xD
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/507/
lol at the guy just casually standing by while his mate is being strangled
WallDives: Only on super serious situtuations~
I love that the guy stands there and stares while his buddy gets owned.
other guy just watches ..... some comeradery there
OH hay! I need to work on my story! Oh well, that is for later.:D
Meanwhile: true friends
PrincessLuna: Hey! Want to join me in the shower?
Airpuff: he had to wait his turn to get his xD
Friends help each other up. True friends don't.
Magic of Friendship doesn't apply to guards apparently.
Im off. Cya everypony! :)
GilDash: Only if you like your showers hot :)
bye TheMonstaMuffin
PrincessLuna: Noticed xDD
Cya TheMonstaMuffin
By TheMonstaMuffin! I love you!
Bye TheMonstaMuffin! (waves and hugs)
TheRainbowDash: True friends are too busy laughing at each other. :D
Is anyone there? nope.
bb everyone ;)
Meanwhile: Lmao, they weren't armed with the elements of harmony
GilDash: True friends has benefits.:D
hiya PrincessLuna
PrincessLuna: I'm sure I can handle the heat. :)
hello everypony
TheRainbowDash: Absolutely. ;)
IS ANYONE THERE ? ....no!.... OK THEN!
Allo Princess_Molestia.
/me cuddles Princess_Molestia
Princess_Molestia: Hello! ;)
Hello Princess_Molestia! (waves and hugs) How are you today?
/me is now very scared of the direction the chat has turned
^
Hi Princess_Molestia! I love you!
/me takes TheRainbowDash and GilDash away
Not enough minerals.

So much rp
Om: Yeah, taken a turn for the best.
/me licks pikorar
/me glomps Princess_Molestia
so much rp...
Build additional pylons
/me is glomped by Airpuff
Yay! Roleplay time!:D
TheRainbowDash: How is that at all good >.>
oh
Om: You only have to worry when she starts making this face ---> ;)
i need to stop
Some people don't read the rules I feel...
xD
Some people
Rules? what rules?
i shall fetch a rug
Try everyone.
PrincessLuna: That face will give me nightmares
I read the rules.
http://www.bronystate.net/rules/
Om: A: I love RP. B: Better when a lot of ponies are involved. C: The topic...:D
I SHALL FETCH A RUG
Meanwhile, check the nospam section. RP is classified as spam in there.
Yeah Om.. nightmares ;)
Princess_Molestia: what are u doing
/me shivers
Princess_Molestia: Make sure it's shagpile. :)
If there's anyone in here who you don't need to relay the rules to Dermathil, it's me.
/me drugs GilDash
hehehee
brb in a minute
what game is this
Oh Meanwhile, at least try being modest.
Meanwhile bends the rules a little bit.
Modesty implies ability.
rdibp: Deus Ex, something something.
TheRainbowDash: Wait...You prefer. More people? Absurd!
-.-
Short of my ability to read, there isn't really much to be proud of about the rules.
Meanwhile, you aren't the one RPing all the time.
Om: Yeah, more ponies is better.
/me drugs everything in Meanwhile s household
>_>
Dermathil: Yeah, that belongs to me to do that job.:D
/me TheRainbowDash's logic does not compute
TheRainbowDash: don't spam too much then. RP is classified as spam.
Om: The more the merrier. ;)
Then it needs not to be brought up, Meanwhile. -.-
Dermathil: Yeah, I was crazy with RP before, but I keep it limited now.
GilDash: Indeed :P
Is anypony in need of a hug today?
Dermathil: Excessive RP is classified as spam 6_9
/me hugs Litwick
I would like a hug, Litwick.
GilDash: What if your on a sinking ship. Like this chat.
Behind you!
Hugs are good.:)
/me hugs Litwick.
Guard!
pikorar: I'm failing to understand exactly what you're trying to get across here.
PrincessLuna: we have a bit too much RP still.
Om: Then we abandon ship for safer waters. ;)
/me hugs Princess_Molestia, pikorar, GilDash, and TheRainbowDash.
It's nothing Meanwhile, forget it.
That means technically, I was breaking the rules all of the time before.:D
I MUST BE OFF to get the others
Forget what?
With the RP and what not.
/me abandons ship
bye Princess_Molestia
/me jumps on Om's lifeboat
Bye Princess_Molestia! (waves and hugs)
/me does RP on chat.
I don't have a lifeboat...
Hey GilDash, whassup dawg? :D
:o
Yo dawg I heard you like RP so I RP about playing RP so I can RP while I RP.
/me giggles at Om "You're the lifeboat, silly" ;)
Had I been picked for moderator 9 months ago, I would've made a pretty strict mod.
MadSurge: Oh, you know. The usual. ;)
Tragically you weren't.
/me drowns
Dermathil: Yeah, and I would be banned immedaitely for my antics.
if i was a mod
GilDash: messing with chat denizens?
wed be ded
/me reconsiders his actions and does not drwon
/me lifts om up into the air and back onto the shit with magic =3
pikorar: I've done that before. So many times. My brackets were like: (( (( (( Stuff. )) )) ))
not banned. You'd get a warning kick somewhere inbetween.
ship*
xD
Good moring everypony
/me glomps pyrocatboy
Dermathil: The problem is that I did it all of the time, every day, every second (back then).
MadSurge: I'm not even having to try hard today. :)
hiya pyrocatboy
pyrocatboy: Holla! :)
mornin' pyrocatboy
This chat would be empty....FOREVER!!! :O :O
Allo pyrocatboy.
Hello pyrocatboy! (waves and hugs) How are you today?:)
Mods are tolerant. I ain't.
ello,mates!
Which is probably why you aren't one.
Allo sonicrainboomer259.
hiya sonicrainboomer259
If I was a mod, I be super leinant, and go from that to super aggressive.
Om....
That isn't why. I derped the interview. That's why.
Yes...?
TheRainbowDash: if i was a mod. we would all be ded
what are we watchin?
Hello sonicrainboomer259! (waves and hugs) How are you today?
You wanna try blowing my trumpet ;)
GilDash: I sat under a chair last night, just to mess with my drunken friends :D
xDDD
Hello everypony. WHos streaming?
Hello there Obsidian! (waves and hugs) Wrek is streaming Deus Ex now.
Wrek is.
MadSurge: I'm a great friend, but a better one when drunk. :D
Okay
Bronysith: All dead? How so?
Airpuff: I hope that isn't directed at me...
TheRainbowDash: twas a joke
hey TheRainbowDash
TheRainbowDash: i would be streaming most of the time though
Bronysith: Oh, ok...:D
Its not a bad question unless you think of it that way Om =O
Eh. I'm happy not to be a mod though. I can do almost anything without being weighted down by useless paperwork.
GilDash: I never drink btw, I'm just insane like that on my own :D
Hi Kids!
And in the left corner we have Meanwhile, weighing in at 150 jiggawatts. And in the right corner we have Dermathil weighing in at 120 jiggaflops....FIGHT *DING*
TaviChaser: hiya
/me hands TaviChaser tea
Airpuff: Safty first, think of the worst and hope for the best.
Dermathil: Eh, the work is good enough for me. If there was a mod position open right now, I would go straight for it.
PrincessLuna: What on earth is a jiggaflop.
Om to think you would think such Om.... not bad...
MadSurge: I'm fairly mad. When I drink everyone seems to have such a good time though. :D
Meanwhile: I dunno, just sounded cool 6_9
let me guess..........DEUS EX!!!
Fair enough.
I've been a mod, although not here. Been a admin, again, not here.
GilDash: I drink all of the time, thank Celestia.:D
....no one knows im Flare? :|
TaviChaser: i know flare
I can abuse this! :D
TaviChaser: I know who you are.
crap.
Airpuff: ...I-...Damit.
TheRainbowDash: I am friends with a few people who got depressed and had to quit their positions.
TaviChaser: molestia is looking for u
/me giggles at Om
Bronysith: D:
TaviChaser: I didn't know you were Flare.
WallDives: I've been a mod. Don't know if I could be one here with what I do. I wouldn't want to tone it down. :D
GilDash: and you DO sound like a fun guy to hang around with :D
Dermathil: Oh, I see....hmm...
GilDash: xDD
him is the best cartoon/anime villian of all time since cell and buu
Hey guys, while we're here discussing what would've happened if we were mods, lets talk about what would've happened if Hitler had won the war :P
MadSurge: Well, I'm shier in IRL, but get to know me and I'l just as fun. :)
i need to glomp somepony
PrincessLuna: Don't talk about the war! :D
lol PrincessLuna xDD
/me glomps teh_Tharassan
I'm meeting those persons at Bronycon in 6 weeks.
I could not mod, chat moves to fast.
GilDash: I still remember the first time I met you, in that Rainbow Dash room one day, and well, you and several others, you know...*winks*:D
GilDash: I'd have to separate duty and fun, like I did then. too bad the sites went down on both occasions.
thats not even funny,PrincessLuna
GilDash: apparently it's the same for me :)
PrincessLuna: if that were the case you would have said "Let's talk about what would've happened if the allies won the war"
:D
Meanwhile: ....touche
Meanwhile: xD
touché
Dat RainBroDash.
TheRainbowDash: Blame Canada.
Meanwhile: tocuhes all teh ponies
Meanwhile: I'm not sure of that alt code for that e T_T
/me noms some icecream =3
GilDash: Oh, those were the good times.
skyscraper club is total domination
GilDash: oi. without canadians, I'm not sure i'd be alive.
imma be opening up steam
PrincessLuna: Depends on the keyboard. Mine is Alt Gr.
TheRainbowDash: Yeah, that was the first, and last, time I met him. :D
Meanwhile: Some people cant type the fancy e
ok,i'll blame canada,ON ONE CONDITION!!!
GilDash: Yeah, he got permanently banned.:D
Wat http://i.imgur.com/tjBxD.jpg
/me punches sonicrainboomer259
Some people clearly need a better handle on their keyboards.
WallDives: No, Canada was a member I met the first day I stopped lurking.
ah.
Radu: its true.
nice Radu
Radu: wow, 100% correct, right on the hay.
TheRainbowDash: That's because he didn't know when to stop. :D
GilDash: Who :o
:'( WHY U HIT ME!?
Who the hell is trying to blame my country for their shit as usualy?
GilDash: I knew when to stop, after I got warned and kicked a few times.
TheRainbowDash: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1116/
GilDash: Some guy pulling it a bit too far? xD
PrincessLuna: I don't know. I only met him for about 4-5 hours. :(
Bronysith: LOL
Dermathil: Theere was some guy who got banned, name's Canada.
Bronysith: Wow, that actually creeps me out a bit...:S
ah
The a-hole had to tarnish my country. Wow.
Someone is a bit touchy today 6_9
I don't think I've ever actually met anyone who's cared about Canada the country in any degree.
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4697/
Airpuff: Yeah, but keeping it all on Mane chat. To be honest, I didn't see him say any worse than I have done, but he might've done something bad after I legt.
*left
Meanwhile: YOU'VE GOT ONE IN YOUR FACE RIGHT NOW
Dermathil: Yeah, I talked and chatted with him, good times back in the day, and then he got out of control,a dn got a permanent ban, oh well.
Okay... So my computer just crashed. Bad. I actually never had a system crash before... But I got the black screen of death.
Meanwhile: facefaceface
Faic.
Ahahaha GilDash sounds interesting xD
PrincessLuna: its not the same, your country deserves it a wee bit more.
Flarechaser
Airpuff: That's how me and PONY/pony_zen met. :)
Hehe, dat Octavia :D
xD
Dermathil: Well if we got into who's country deserved it more it would be a pointless conversation going nowhere fast ;)
Airpuff: Yeah, those good old days back in March and early April 2012, the Canada, excesive RP, pomfing, wubbing days.:D
Are there really a lot of moose in Canada?
Meanwhile: Vimy.
yes.
TheRainbowDash: ahahahaha xD
Sweet. I want to see a moose.
Canada, eh? Why are we talking about Canada?
TheRainbowDash: The chat used to be worse than it is now?
Om: yes.
Airpuff: It ws good times, while it lasted, and it still is today, not the pomfing and all that, but still good to hang out around here.
Hi Radu, I love you!
Om: Yush
Hi pikorar, I love you too! :3
TheRainbowDash: I guess x)
But why is that, pikorar?:O
/me is now slightly mortified
PONOIES
...we need more ponies.
Dat PONOIES
Radu: because I just love you.
WE BURNT THE WHITE HOUSE DOWN ONCE
TheRainbowDash: Not on Mane chat, but on #Rainbow_dash it happens every so often. :D
/me kisses Om "You know you like it?" ;)
Om: Yeah, when I first joined here, I got thrown into insanity, excesive RP, chat rape, shutdown of chatrooms, man, good mayhem.
Dermathil: again, without Canadians liberating the netherlands, I wouldnt exist, so I'm grateful.
Meanwhile: Damn straight.
pikorar: I love you too. :3
indeed
Dermathil: We blew up two cities with nuclear bombs once.
GilDash: Oh yeah, it was the Rainbow Dash when that happened.
Airpuff: No, I don't.
TheRainbowDash: You know, I've only been kicked once since I've been here. Warned a couple of times, but only kicked once. :)
/me ruffles TheRainbowDash s mane
pikorar: lmaoooo
Ahahah Om x)
nom nom
GilDash: Kicked a thousand times for message spam, nothing too serious though.:D
TheRainbowDash: That is unfortunet. Mybe not for you.
It doesn't really help your case when the best thing you can bring to your countries defence is the number of people it's killed in one shot.
Dermathil: Nope, Japanese
I KNOW
lolwut
TheRainbowDash: Never for spam, just for, I guess, "inappropriate content." :D
Chill out Dermathil.
06proITsolution:
GilDash: Well, it was both/.
TheRainbowDash: I've gotten kkicked for message spam myself some times.. and once for trolling T.T
I think imma change my name back to normal :P
Actually in the Manhattan project I guess we did blow up parts of the US.
06when a program doesnt work, hit ALL th buttons! :D
GilDash: YOU GOT KICKED? YOU'RE A MONSTER :P
yay
Thanks Wrek. :D
Oh, Wrek has his mic on?
That's kick no 2 under my belt. :D
MadSurge: Hey, I got kicked a billion times for spam and RP, one kick is nothing bad.:D
I has no sound.
i got kicked once for telling the chat i farted
Thats our Wrek!!
*laughter*
Airpuff: You are a troll >.>
Nothing like the fresh taste of trains.
Best way for me to chill out.
I like trains.
FlareChaser, wasn't Colgate your waifu? Now it's Octavia?
I got kicked for shipping otakon
/me ruffles TheRainbowDash s mane

TheRainbowDash: I thought that was Meanwhile
Oi.

Irish_Pony|Blind: Nah, Meanwhile is just boring. :D

Om: lies and hearsay.

Irish_Pony|Blind: No, not even him. I am currently sane. Do not see me when I am insane and super silly.
0,5Ohai

Meanwhile: :p
Hi guys. Sorry I haven't been on in a while.
WallDives: Tis the truth!
/me bonks GilDash in the head with a cinderblock.
TheRainbowDash: Not as silly as SuperBrony64
TheRainbowDash: We don't, because you get kicked. :D
ded
Om: you're here. that disqualifies you from normalcy.
Hi icybeauti! I forgive you just as much as I love you. And that's a lot.
i'm baack
Allo icybeauti.
BronyState™ Sanity sold separately

Irish_Pony|Blind: Oh, right, forgot abouyt him. I am his second in command of the Sillines Department, right in 2nd place.:)
hi icybeauti.
Hey WallDives
/me glomps Meanwhile
Your chat is deeeeeeaaaaaaaaad.
Since ever, Radu.
WallDives: No, it just means...That...uh. I'm normal
hi valoreins and icybeauti
/me is hit by a low flying pyrocatboy.
Heya Jim
/me stares at Om.... "You're normal?"
Hello, well everypony that is coming into here!
Om: again, LIES. and I dont think GilDash lieks normal people.
Airpuff: Yes.
/me nuzzles Meanwhile
/me giggles at Om ... If you say so
WallDives: I have very broad tastes. :)
0,5Meanwhile is eating it!
WallDives: Then I am VERY normal
Lies, hearsay, damn lies and Shenanigans.
0,5And then he's gonna eat me!
Om, nobody is normal. Some people are just more normal than others.
Oh my goooooooooood.
What's normal?
I'm not doing a stupid question, but what exactly is normal? Who defines it?
Om: That won't save you. ;)
Ni!
0,5OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODNESS
Damn
Ni!
Define normal anypony.
lol
Irish_Pony|Blind: IT!
No om, you are but "VERY"
What's home?
TheRainbowDash: Me.
What're cows?
MOO
No GilDash! It hurts!
Om: Bullshit, try again.
Om = Not normal, just "very"
/me screeches at GilDash
Oh no GilDash, I just said it!
Normal sucks, whatever it is.
No, I just said it again GilDash. UGH! No!
GilDash: Eh, that is close enough for me.
True fact.
pikorar: That's 3 times now. :D
We could talk about normal until the cows come home
/me nuzzles Meanwhile
so... normal=perfect? :\
I'm normal, and everyone else is weird.
/me noms on GilDash's mane
I do not nuzzle. >_>
Om, you're kind of a jerk... :C
In our soceitym there are different definitions of "normal" But they are dumb and will turn all of us into clones if we follow it.
XD
/me stares at Om before giving him a hug "You live a hard life here"
I guess you can say that valoreins, only in specific situations though. Normal is one of those abstract words.
icybeauti: yay, logic!
Dat attempt to throw the guy over the side.
Om: I try not be normal. But I usually return back to normal.
/me nuzzles Meanwhile anyway
GUYS. THAT FRIEND I MENTIONED WHOSE SISTER'S IN THE HOSPITAL? THE ONE WHO COULD HAVE DIED?

Shoo be moo, shoo shoo be moo.

Okay okay. I'll admit it...I may not be as normal as I said....
Ninjazz|Work: I do not think that word means what you think it means...
valoreins: no such thing as normal man
Srry bout that, Dashie.
/me noms on Om
valoreins: normal is boring
GilDash: I hope I means what I mean. :S
Om: and the grass is green, right?
/me giggles at Om "I knew you liked it"
Litwick: That's really awesome to hear.

Radu about 5 times
GilDash: Simple, I have no long or short term gaols
Is this Diablo 3?
SayWhat: mmmmm cookies?
SayWhat: oh yeah
Radu: OVER 9000 TIMES
SayWhat i guess so
:D^
Radu: Only one time, because I was speechless and didn't have the urge to press the replay button. It was too much awesomeness to handle.
Where is the secret mlp level?!
My urge to buy Diablo 3 is increasing.
TheRainbowDash: You're epic, did you know that?
piratecatboy: I don't have booty....
Om: Well, don't worry. If you trip, I'll catch you. ;)
Hey Scoot-Scootaloo my nick is acting up again

Om: I'd say experience, but I've little. So I'm going to go with natural talent. ;)
Thanks Scoot-Scootaloo!
SayWhat I will ask the allmighty google about that
My hatred is too low.
Scoot-Scootaloo you're capable of hate?
Sorry, but this is too important
Meanwhile
GilDash: Lucky us
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c06vzZaL3Y4
00,03Only sometimes :3

CK|Ded: I think its... Diablo 3?
/me 08,01will stop now

Airpuff: To be fair, it's D3's own fault for hiring WoW's artists and animators and having them design a game that is supposed to resemble WoW. :p
Hey grandmas are cool

Level Up!
Enjoy your time Biglaw

God... cupcakes the video gives me shudders.
notes*
SayWhat O-o
Airpuff: Not as much as you might think actually.
CK|Ded: Aha?
Especially if you go over the original color scheme they were using, which was a direct C/P of WoW.
Hey SayWhat what was important a minute ago?
They had to darken it because players got pissy that the game was way too bright.
CK|Ded: Yeah we get it, D3 is WoW.
There's a secret pony level in Diablo 3, I meant to copy paste something else =/
Meanwhile: Can't be emphasized enough.
But your name was pasted O_o
CK|Ded: Still the graphics are diffrent, and the gampleay are totally diffrent too
Meanwhile: Also how is Trixie doing?
CK|Ded: That sound you hear right now is the sound of no one caring.
I'm with CK|Ded
Meanwhile: Weird, since people responded to it and agree with it, that's an awful lot of noise for no one caring. :p
dem puking guys
I know right.
Boomers!
Hello

Allo PewDiePie.
Ah, I require the need for more noms, be right back everypony.:D

Wel, hello PewDiePie.

Waves and hugs and all that jazz.
TheRainbowDash: ... not more toast again? xDD
PewDiePie: Hes right over by the BARRELLS

Diablo 3
SuperBrony64: Diablo 3
00,03MW3
Hi SuperBrony64!:D
looks like diablo 3
SayWhat: Good man, GW2 is the better investment overall. D3 is pretty good, but....of the two, I think GW2 is superior if you can only afford one.
/me coughs
SuperBrony64: diablo 3 silly
OH LOL
SuperBrony64: Error 37
SuperBrony64: Cooking Mama.
Its me Chuck Test
a
Well then

SB64: It's WoW, silly
You okay, Om.

ChuckTesta strikes again 0_o
Ninjazz|Work: Just dandy.
It's the official My Little Pony game! PANIC!:O
I also want Borderlands 2 >.< GGRRRRR
SuperBrony64: Moo.
DAT Invi :3
11,02What is the point of Diablo 3 anyway? Is it just a run and shoot kind of game?
Om: I think not.
Run and click
It's hack-and-slash grind.
like hell boy
SuperBrony64: Shoo bee MOO, shoo shoo bee MOO
00,03It's exactly like MW3? :O
SuperBrony64: Hack and Slash
TaviChaser: You wanted my server didn't you? Do you just want an amory link instead?
dat VioletGreySha :)
1-1
SuperBrony64: .....wat.....wat..WAHTA WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
Scoot-Scootaloo: lol
SuperBrony64: Hack and slash, yeah.
^-^
Meanwhile: sure :|
/me hugwubbles VioletGreySha
Ninjazz|Work: No really. I am perfectly abnormal
11,02Scoot-Scootaloo: Sounds like it to me :/
You run around, kill things, then kill bigger things, and then win
TaviChaser: http://derpy.me/dZyAw
Is the game good?
/me hugs Invi back
Om: If you say so.
SuperBrony64: i think it has some puzzles
00,03That's why I was so into this game! It's like CoD!
Meanwhile: I'm clicking it but nothing is happening.
multiple shot lightning enchanted
it's a dungeon crawling game
Meanwhile: nvm :3
TaviChaser: Clearly you're a bad person.
Is Diablo 3 good?
you tell us
Scoot-Scootaloo: comparing CoD to Diablo? ARE YOU INSANE?
For only the truly righteous can see my links.
Meanwhile: Smexxy gear
Dat whelp smash
Destructable terrain? Okay, that's a good addition.
I'll say the previous two are more worth your time
Meanwhile: something is wrong then, caise I can click it.
If your hatered is to low, does that mean you love everything?
Or not enough fucks to give.
My hatred is never too low.
Meanwhile: I still need to get my Bloodfang Pants :P
05oh look
Plot exposition?
05one of the secrent pony level items
Oh my oh my
no man has a greater love for his *cutoff*
O rly?
nice.
Whats it called?
Wrek, you steaming? YOU GOING TO THE PONY LEVEL? :D
I've seen the pony level. It's....magical.
It's funny how you call it Pony level when there's also carebears and flower and other stuff
KILL HIM
What's so awesome with the pony level. It's not a FiM reference, big deal
11,02Interesting game music
Meanwhile: RP server? :P
yeah magical..... CK|Ded
Oh no that's not the game music lol
SuperBrony64: it's Wrek's own music
Radu: The elites have FiM-based names. >_>
TaviChaser: I originally moved there with friends whom I no longer talk to.
11,02Oh ><
CrimsonPhoenix: When you have elite bosses called Nightmarity and Midnight Sparkle, I think you can call it a pony level.
CK, like?
CK|Ded: Like?
Oh my.
Nightmarity.
Radu: well colored ponies and unicorns..... a strange cupcake referece (everytime u kill a pony u get a cupcake) and rainbows everywhere
Get it?
Not enough hatred? xD
Haha, that's great
Hello.
Meanwhile: why dont switch to Durotan?
And there were a few others I can't recall off the top of my head, but they were all definitely FiM sounding.
05once my main character has all the items and shit
hi FrankTheShyGuy.
TaviChaser: Because I have a guild.
05yes i will stream the secrent pony level
wohoo
dun dun dunn
How are you WallDives?
a
b
c
One would think hatred as a unreliable source
q
d
Wrek: How long will it take to get all those items?
Meanwhile: give it to somepony
FrankTheShyGuy: okay.
But it is fair to say the level wasn't originally an FiM joke, yes.
11,02So, is this an MMORPG?
not really
SB: Yes and no.
SuperBrony64: kinda, but not.
Sort of. :S
TaviChaser: I'm not the GM, but it'd be rude of me to up and leave it.
Meanwhile: ...
Diablo 3 is multiplayer?
sorry for being vague.
Oh pony, didn't know that
Coop.
SuperBrony64: No, it's a single or multiplayer game that requires you to be logged in even if you're playing single player.
11,02But what's the advantage of that?
You don't progress heroic DS with a guild then leave it. Unless you're a douche.
Radu: The game is always online, and the single player has an option to allow friends to join your gams.
*games
does he have infinite arrows?
SuperBrony64: So that people won't hack it
SuperBrony64: That is the ultimate question.. xD
Ergo yes, it's multiplayer moreso than single.
Meanwhile: did you JUST switch factions?
TaviChaser: I've been Alliance for about a year.
Its an MSRPG (Masivly Singleplayer Role Playing Game)
08,01bum bum baaaa-da dum. ba da dara dum bum! ba da dara bum bum. ba ra ba baah bara ba da ra, bada ba -- (ba ra ba daah bara da ba ba ba ba bada ba); BA BA BA BA BARA BADABADA BADABADA BAAAAM, BA DAAA BA DA DARA BA DA DUUUUM!

Meanwhile: that was my main, I lied :3
Hey Acleps.
Hi Acleps

Bjornfot: pretty much... grind like fuck till you get up in level.. after like 10 hours of grinding you can start playing.

Meanwhile: its still 85, I just switched back from a RP server.
What are we watching?
D3.
Acleps: Diablo 3
Airpuff: And you were making fun of me for saying it was WoW. :p
TaviChaser: You're a bad person.
WallDives, Jim: Thanks :)
CK|Ded: well Wow does atleast have QUESTS! xD
Meanwhile: I AM SO NAUGHTY
wait, what.
TaviChaser: Not really. You're kind of a jerk.
CK|Ded: anyways, tell me an leveling-game that does not have the same concept? -.-
Airpuff: Judging from the giant exclamation points above the quest-giving NPCs, so does D3.
And back after my noms.
Meanwhile: ...aw...
CK|Ded: Cant be xD
god this chat is buggy
Airpuff: GW2?
Airpuff: And yes, I had more toast.:D
Athgaar3: What do you mean?
wb, Dashie.
CK|Ded: Thats the way games work no matter what. The diffrence between these games and others though, is that others acctually have some sort of challange related tot hem lol
...I'm just gonna go play TF2 now... to wipe away mah tears :|
Have fun TaviChaser.
I keep disconnecting for no clear reason
Ah, alright then TaviChaser. Hope you fail.
/me stares at TheRainbowDash ..... "you never get tired of those now do ya?"
Airpuff: GW2 still has quests, it's just more than you run into them. But it. :p
Athgaar3_: Are you using tha flash version? It seems to work better for me..
*it's a better experience IMO.
Airpuff: Eeyup, toast never gets old.
TheRainbowDash: I hope you die.
Airpuff is there already a release date for GW2?
TaviChaser: Hahaha, you too.:D
CK|Ded: Same concept.
I outright can't use the flash version
Airpuff: Only in the loose sense of "there are quests"
Invi: dont ask me xDD Im not the oen talkin about it xD
Athgaar3_: Why :O?
Acleps: Holla! :)
Airpuff: They function nothing alike.
TheRainbowDash: I keep my tast with variance by alternating peanut butter Nutella and cream cheese
Airpuff ok ok sorry
Acleps: It just flat out doesn't work.
CK|Ded: how come?
taost damit!
GilDash: oh, you're still alive.
Invi: ahaha np x)
Acleps: No idea why.
GilDash: Oh, you're here too :)
toast*
Om: Hmm, that is pretty good also///
Airpuff: Because they're all 100% optional, save for the personal story. :p
Athgaar3_: Oh... :(
Airpuff: And even that is easy to skip, actually....
CK|Ded: same is for example world of warcraft, on top they have like 15 zones you can level in not much diffrence.
I'm going to play the shit out of GW2
I'm here, but busy. NOT what you're all thinking, honest. :)
Chaingun Bow
GilDash: Really.
sure, GilDash, sure.
there is always enough hatred
OK... I'm just gonna play Vagrant Story
Airpuff: Like I said, if you're arguing the statement that "there are quests", fine, they're the same. That's ALL that remains similar between them.
Actually I'm discussing novel ideas. None of them involving what you're thinking. :D
GilDash: Then what? :)
CK|Ded: All games which has leveling involved has the same setup, you can decide to do quests or grind you way up in level, how you obtain the quests make no diffrence.
Fire ALL the goddamn arrows!
GilDash: Okie dokie loki....
I don't believe you, GilDash.
GilDash: New novel ideas? sounds interesting...
Hmm, ideas I see.
Airpuff: Yeah, it kinda does.
GilDash, I'd say I believe you, but I dont like lying.
Airpuff: The experience is entirely different. :P
Ninjazz|Work: You wouldn't. :D But it's true.
CK|Ded: Guess i can agree there.
Who's playing right now?
05rain in a few
GilDash: Share some of these dieas with me.
....oh, right, stomach is reminding me I haven't eaten. O.o
WallDives: Honest truth. Cross my heart and hope to die, stick a cupcake in my eye.
twilight is watching
How true can you be?
ok
I should just start a damned chatroom for this. :D
Who's playing
GilDash: if you say so.
/me sticks a cupcake in GilDash 's ear
Hey I'm still here :D Did you miss me?
GilDash: Well, I suppose we have to belive it from a pinkie promise
....
GilDash: Exactly. I am a fic writer too, so....share one ideas that you have so far.
Airpuff: Stop it, I'm trying not to break a Pinkie Promise here. You're not helping. :D
SKYPE
I... MUST ... SE THE NAM
/me gives GilDash more cupcakes
ok, so I thought I was pretty god at Starfox 64. And now I'm watching videos. HOLY SHIT I SUCK.
/me looks sad at GilDash "Owkai" :'(
Fun fact: Skype rearranged is Spyke
good^
TheRainbowDash: It just took me 10 minutes to get all of them across to pikorar. If you want me to go again, then just no. :D
Sorry WallDives
I'm just gonna play on 25 of May
WallDives: I know that feel
TheRainbowDash: Setup a chatroom and I'll do so. :)
GilDash: Wait, huh?
Radu: it's also Keyps.
because i don't need to go to school
:D
Mud Keyps.
Keyps? What does Keyps mean?
I WISH I STILL PLAYED WOW
Oh
(Argentina)
Mud Keyps :D
So I heard you like mudkeyps.
SayWhat: No you dont.
SayWhat: Then why won't you?
You're right
so someone's got a favourite pony
I hate being so competitive. now I have to study.
Nope... I'm just gonna play Vagrant stoty
WoW destroyed me
story
Athgaar3_: ... dont.. get us in on that..
From PS1
Airpuff: Mind, I'm not saying the typical quest system is bad, only that D3's new system is intended to model that of WoW. :p
TheRainbowDash: Invite everypony else who cares about this stuff as well if you're setting one up.
SayWhat: that's what it does :D
(EPIK GAME)
I hate WoW
Airpuff: I was referring to his background, Firefox skin, etc
GilDash: Oh, ummm, fuck, I need to work on my story too, umm, and I probably need to go anyway in a few hours.
GilDash, good job. I'm not confident enough in my writing to come up with fanfics :D
Airpuff: Twilights everywhere
sorry about that... i just hate it
CK|Ded: Well.. that us pretty much the standard questsystem in all games thoguh.. go to a npc recieve a quest deliver and repeat...
Athgaar3_: ahaha okei
You're entitled to hate whatever you want to legacyofvrak.
MadSurge: Neither am I. I JUST DON'T STOP WITH THE IDEAS. :[
As long as you're civil about i.
I prefer playing Half Life, Crysis, Portal, Minecraft or even my 93 PSX games
it*
Airpuff: Sort of. The WoW structure emphasizes this in certain ways, though, methods that became staples in virtually every MMO since.
legacypfvrak: You've got a nice taste in games :)
GilDash: Writing is hard.
thanks
08,01anyone streaming?
CK|Ded: But seriously though, it is not the "WOW" structure.
MORE WOW
/me points at Wrek
CK|Ded: Wow is using the standard leveling gamestructure which came with games beforei t.
Om: Writing is easy. *Editing* is hard. I don't want to write because I keep focusing on having to edit it. :(
GilDash: O.o
Airpuff: So? WoW is the king, it gets claim to the territory. :P
F.E.A.R. 1, OR 2... (I need 3 NOW)
GilDash: What is this "editing" you speak of?
GilDash: Okay, I suppose having a good editor is the hard part.
Airpuff: Editing and me are at constant odds with each other.
08,01Meanwhile: i'm feeling a little hot; maybe i'll take off some clothes
CK|Ded: Nah, wow isnt the king, just the fanboys talking about stuff they dont know, claiming wow was the fist and that all other games, even the ones released earlier are clones.
Airpuff: Sort of like how some shooters get compared to Halo, despite Halo reusing ideas from older games too.
/me sighs.
has anyone tried Tribes Ascend?
NEED IT... WANT IT [PsycoSparkle face]
don't compare games to other games
When you said that GilDash I thought of the fight music from StarTrek TOS
/me hugs Meanwhile whats the matter
^^
^
Om: I can edit myself, but I don't have the confidence to pull it off.
08,01i'm currently listening to Chopin's Nocturne Op. 9 No. 2
okay (meme)
Acleps: My mortal foe in the world of writing. :D
GilDash: Give it a try :P
08,01it's wonderful
asneakykitty: That's the only measurable way to decide if a game is worth purchasing. O.o
GilDash: I understand.
GilDash: No, but what is it in writing? Making the text better?
Conyst: Never watched much TOS, but I think I know the one you mean. ;)
08,01recording by Vadim Chaimovich
GilDash: all joking aside, I know what you mean. good luck with your story, and all.
08,01legacyofvrak: listen to some Chopin afterwards
hello everypony i'm back!
Acleps: Yes. Making sure things flow, make sense, are gramatically correct, etc.

EAH
08,01i can play a couple of his 24 Preludes
E.A.H.

GilDash: Oh, that makes sense. When I see the word "editing", all I think is video, video and video
08,01the famous one (Raindrop Prelude) is one of my audition pieces
GilDash: the one WallDives was wishing you luck with
08,01also!
alexxm: I mean his/her work in general.

CrimsonPhoenix: There's something wrong with their eyes.
Nabronyan: no one is streaming
/me sips tea politely.
GilDash: considering I dont write (because I'm so dissatisfied with my writing in general), thats a hell of a achievement.
nothing is playing at the moment
GilDash: So, how many words would you write in one sessions?
GilDash: I know I just wanted to show it off since I was watching it just now
Acleps: we talking about fanfics?
I see.
*stare at sun*
Ninjazz why are you on bronystate at work?

Bronysith: I think about writing in general
WallDives, Acleps: Usually betwen 1,000-2,000 words in one session. Last year I started *really* late, so I did 10,000 every day for five days. :$
Midnight_Tempest: There usually isn't a scheduled movie on sunday anyway.
Because I am an idiot, Lil_B. :$
Acleps: ic
