ANOTHER?
Saturn: Osnap!
03I'm not sayin this is a bad thing
03just pointing it out
Saturn: oh snap!
no it's not
eh?
Aw....
-Sadness-
03I thought dA allowed mature content?
OMG! YEA!
Code Lyoko!
not porn
it does
wudis
Code Lyoko with PONIES
mature as in nudity
03how is that different
00,10they have many eps but they are voice only
lol pony
03naked pictures of girls
..
03anyway
LOL
Oh wow
Code Lyoko
Wait wut
well, now that you mention it, te front page of DA does have questionable content
I remember this
03and no I don't go around looking for it
haha
ok
03it usually always does
03that's my point
I'm on the front page right now
I remember watching like 1 episode of this
Come get it get it
not a single questionable image
08,01like hours ago
how old is code lyoko
I STILL say we should see Code Ment for some dumb laughs :P
O SHIT
03well it's random
Where Fluttershy?
DISEY
XD
as has been for the past every day I go on
no it's not
DISNEY***
WHEN I AS A LD I ATE TWELVE DOZEN EGGS!
the front page isn't random, unless you set it to "newest"
02Nude isn’t supposed to be sexual, porn is
Wait wut
04"Nude" is fine if it'
and it FITS DAMMIT!
well, cleavage
in which case, it would be uploaded too fast for the filter people to remove it
i liek Rainbow Dash :3
it's not blatant "HEY LOOK I HAVE A <censored>"
Please do not swear. You have said a swear word 13 time(s).
AND EVERY LAST INCH OF ME IS COVERED IN HAIR!!
.-.
then don't put it on newest
wait..
code lyoko is airing a 5th season this year
lol
03even simpler is to not go to the site at all
03but
I remember this song :I
03my point being
win win win
any porn images that go through there are removed within hours
M-uh... The sky...?
honestly it's not that bad lol
DAT RD VOICE!
It fits...
ahahahah
04And the label "porn" is bent, screwed over and dodged at every opportunity
lol yea
it's hard to regulated everything
XD
-d
WUT?
O_o
LOL
04Namely in the region of "erotic literature"
00,10not this week
i really REALLY liek Rainbow Dash xD
Expectorating=Spitting
"get large"....
barge? in midevil times?

http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/003/266/Gaston_Reads_Twilight.jpg
heres the DA definition
http://help.deviantart.com/565/
I have this and it's sequal on VHS
NSFW/Q/text
03LMAO that's actually fun to read :P
02all I know is that some sites are even more prone to mature content. Like how some people try to turn FB into a real porn site
I'm scared to ask for the summary
03um
6that's fun to read, yet you don't like the content on DA
03who tries to turn FB into a porn site
03um
don't mention the sequel
does fluttershy= belle?
03did I ever say I don't like it
03I just said a lot of it is
SEQUAL SEQUAL SEQUAL!
sometimes people accidentally nude pictures on FB
6ok well
02drf, lots of people do
6either way
6most of it is removed lol
yeah
Twilight=Belle
/me hides from the shipstorm
is this Belle?
bbl guys going afk
as with any other massively popular site
03LOL
<.< It fits Twilight.
02both dA and FB do
Saturn: XD
^
03:P
wut......
mfw when i dont know any of these songs in english
Dat Saturn ship :d
Bonjoutr!
WIN!
NOw THIS is good
6because nudity doesn't automatically mean porn
02^
^
02pretty much
Oooh, my head is pounding the second this song came on... xD
04FB
03Facebook doesn't allow any of that
03regardless of name
04*post image with cleavage*
6it's not inappropriate
04%00+ likes
04500*
dat bon bon voice
hi MahBoi7771
oops :P
why is spike so...white
lol
*!
02besides
that wasnt a swordfight
/me hides
08,01panda: he is a solitary sailor
some topless girls, etc
some are even on brochures/guides
yeah sadly
04which incites the "What the F*ck" reaction from me
XD
6actually
counted about 3/1
6that's debatable
That fast?
Till season 3!!!!
PHOTO FINISH!
03most people consider female nudity as inapropriate LOL
Saturn: theres two movies i need to watch again
D
6:/
lol
03at least
08,01panda: but some are rubbish
03if it's a boy looking at it
the adventurers hookers?
6and this is the area where more artists have to sit awkwardly while people talk about naked people
03regardless of any artistic point
08,01like that one about ancient egypt
08,01
08,01or moses
6I see naked people every week :/
02-the
08,01or something
Shipping
Saturn: :/ hm... good point...
00,10yeah
03hey like I said, I'm not saying I mind... just that most people go "boys looking at naked girls, HMM"
6and we just...yeah. we don't see any difference really
6uh
03yes but meaningful purpose isn't necessarily the same as "I'm going to just take pictures of naked girls"
lol
i've read that fic
6yep
6until social taboo comes in
^
Saturn: agreed
03just as how you could look up, say, how to build a bomb and say "oh, it's just education" when it could also be called terrorism?
6nudity is not exactly a social taboo
6porn is
I use "art" as synonymous with "medium" when I made my statement
as in
03I know, bad example, I like extreme examples
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/53016952/This%20Day%20Aria%20Transcription%20%28test%29.wav

Dear lord... Dats Wacist.

You spin me right round.
6cuz they always go for those two

03what I have against most religious people is the fact that they won't accept that someone ISN'T
although the cut up is kinda meh

03I'm fine with the whole
the actual footage is great
6which wasn't that long ago actually

Hey, Rain!

6but that was back when everyone thought that it would force churches to marry against their beliefs
6uh...that was the california proposition that went nationwide as a huge issue
6when the church wanted same sex marriage banned
03ah
Hat!
03see that's the thing
Meh
blurple
6but once I figured out it wasn't going to force churches to do anything
6I was like f* this
Rarity or Twilight would count.
flerple
6marriage is also a religious theme though
03but technically
Potent Potables = Strong Alchoholic Drinks
03you can just
03go to a court
03be like
6you can't isolate it as just one side
6it has two sides
03and done
aww no more fluer :D
6but for that reason, can't be settled as church's or state's
Nonetheless marriage originated as a religious thing
lol
03you don't *have* to do it in a church, it's just a common thing
6no you don't
XD
oh man i cant wait for bill&ted 3
03exactly

6but marriage IS also a religious theme

03basically that
03:P
6I'm not saying it's right
HAHAH "Best WHoa"
cold
6I'm just saying that it is not purely at "legal" status
LOL
dat timing
HOT HOT HOT!
6*a
03right, but I'm saying that in states that allow gay marriage, it basically is in that case
03or rather, recognize it
iced tea is best pony
03XD
lol
XD
where do these yays keep coming from
03at which part
Hahahha
6is my point
03no but I mean
I won't give you the satisfaction
03two gay people can
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1649/ that's me with everypony in here
03or just consider it two people living together
XD
Famous mothers below me...
below me :D
LOL
03or say you get married in a state that allows gay marriage, then move to a state that doesn't
lol
03etc etc
/me dat laugh
6uh
6note this whole time I was talking about morals behind marriage, not the actual "what is happening"
LOL
XD
6i didn't realize we were discussing that
lol
drf, technically with regards to the constitution, they have to recognize it
Yet.
02if someone wants to be gay, why do they have to get married in the first place? It's not like it's Illegal to be gay or even have a civil union..
03I was talking about it being legal, not "ethical"
full faith and credit clause
6uh
03and yeah basically
6a lot of things besides just living together
03there are a couple things
03tax breaks
6taxes
03insurance w/e
YES!
moar jeopardy, i loved the part with r's section

SOOOO awkward
THERE IS NO RIGHT ANSWER
XXX
00,10they were like lolnope
LOL
6I don't think there is a single state that actually outright doesn't recognize same sex marriage
bad decision if neither of them wanted to say a word...
6 /maybe/ utah, but idk
03I think most don't o.o
^
Those yays
6banning marriage as opposed to recognizing
the only wrong anwer was dopey
02I thought civil unions let people have those rights
where dey comin from
03no
there are a lot of states that have it in their constitution
yes, I know. But the decision to "play?"
6to not recognize it?
that marriage is defined as between a man and a woman
huh
6k
interesting
lol
LOL
it also happens to me when someone says "Rain" or "Fleur"
lol
03as far as I know, there are only like... 10 states that regognize gay marriage?
DAT FACE
03if that

LOL!
dat word
ZERO!
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwww
XD
Fucking shit!
Kidding me. :D
02Problem is, two people of the same sex kind of goes against the definition of marriage. Just sayin’
I thought they were still in that process
I HEARD someone say "ZERO"
bluefare
lol whats a gyenecologist? :D
oh no
*l
My face hurts now
that definition is subjective to each person
03that's the CHURCH'S definition
A
Ins't it Drivers sidedoor? <.<
03I need to find that one picture
please say A
03it was like
"back end"
6the definition of marriage has kind of evolved over the years
03and you see the marriage police come over
Whats a gynecologist? :F
it's A DAMMIT!
exacto
00,10your answeres?
03and be like "NO, A MARRIAGE IS BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN"

A
a.
A!
I see marriage as being a binding between two consenting adults
ALL OF THE ABOVE
pause?
A.
03yeah
........
D
Z.
i see marriage as marriage
6I see marriage as however people want to see it
03and heck, call it a civil union, as long as they get the same legal rights...
wait this is in america need to work it out again...
6I don't care how people see it, that's fine
WAIT SHIT!
03the name is more a formality
which avoids when people go "well, if you allow gay marriage, then why not marriage with children and pets"
PERPENDICULAR
03LOL
6I just flat out don't care
Example of perpendicular lines: +
03technically dogs can sign a marriage contract
that's just f*ing dumb
03or something silly
6because once you care, people get upset in some way
Oh hi.
Hello.
nooo
6koso, if that's how you want to define it
dammit wommah!
i know this is kind of a dumb way to see it

00,10trickquestion sleighs have no doors

but false advertising
^
02But how would it be legit if they’re not even sexually compatible? Again, just saying

JUST LIKE US :D
whoa
that's a good sign for her...
03people get pregnant in high school

Anybody there?

there is no solid definition of marriage
Wait...HOW?
6there is not singular-
the correct answer is lesbian
Fail.:(
I dont even...huh?
as with many things
02And if they try to be sexually compatible, then that’s just gross and unhealthy
22.22
perpendicular means at a right angle to you.

6that's their decision
define "unhealthy
"
03and granted
I like how i'm the only one in this theater channel
03that picture I linked

00,10perhaps

Lol
03because of the legal rights associated with being married
because they want it to be called *marriage*
04@Vordox: I had to patch Mortal Kombat
03or maybe not rights, but whatever you want to call it
03legal status I guess?

this issue can't be solved in congress, it won't be solved in a chatroom
XD
definitely gay
04None of them play fighting games except for me >>
02lmao

i'll agree with that, i am not sure if it was originally thought of when it was first made
but that doesn't mean it's right to shoot the idea down

Okay....THIS LOOKS INTERESTIN!
03yeah
03same
03since
6unless it's VERY CLEARLY a fault
00,10it's just a one off
03when's the last time it's actually helped anything
03>Occupy Wall Street
03they just like
00,10the whole show is not like this
03make everyone hate them
03LOL
This should be an entire series
The whole is more slice-of-life
03I mean sure it's a good cause
6yeah
6perspective of a group
03but protesting doesnt'really help it
02See, I don’t mind when people are gay/for gays, but I also don’t mind when people are against gays as long as they don’t try to be bias
that is how my mind works
6meaning that other groups are having their opinions shot down
and then anime
yaaaay anime
6by a group standing with their picket walls
WAT
03how is it possible to be against gays without being biased
04I don't play MvC3 anymore >>
uguu
6I rather have my opinion and let others have their
:D
6s
NOW TO THE OLD STYLE!
DOMON!
6uh
WHois THIS FREAK!?
None of the jokes in this show even make sense

OH MY LOL http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3836/
Everywhere
02Aurora I tolerate gays, but my personal opinion is to not be for gay rights, etc.
6that's actively putting yours out there for everyone else in competition with theres
yes, because that involved promoting and advancing a cause, but there's nothing inherently wrong with that
theres a 10 hour version

*pickles
Animations..
It's CN, they don't usually make good decisions.
04But in any case you are welcome ^_^
I can't be random when Pinkie Pie is around.
04Adult Swim and CN aren't the same company though
Aww Pinkie
04Kinda like Nickelodeon and Nick @ Nite

:O
Oh... I didn't know that.
NO DAT BUFFER!
How are they going to manage that?
04But again, not the same people
00,10yes
You're not going to stay for brunch? :(
04Yes, they're not the same people
Like Toonami on one day and Adult Swim on another? Or are they going to split the hours?
hmm

04Sumi, I'm not getting into an argument with you. For god's sakes, you don't even want to believe that Mass Effect 3 is riddled with controversy and is a *bad* product.
I really dont care about the toonami thing really

Man, that great news.
04Now where are you going with the conversation, because all I said is that I'm not getting into an argument over adultswim and CN being or not being the same company
04It's not the shows, it was never ever about the shows
02[The current time where I live is 0306:23:4502 on 03Sunday, 05/20/201202. I am in 03Eastern Standard Time02, also known as 03GMT -5 Hours02.]

I only even cared to watch like 1 show on toonami
If it wasn't Doom or Blues Clues, it was Toonami.

All with my BFG.
I mean
04I want a good single player experience but with something resembling a story
story - 2012
yeah right
04Like I said, it doesn't need to be Shakespeare, just something that warrants a full single player mode
ZZZZzzzzzZZZZzzzzzZZZZZzzzzz
DO EXPLOSIONS COUNT AS STORY
Agreed.
04There it goes
Thanks
/me mumbles something
Heh. Thinking about the gaming industry makes me sad.

Woah, that drawing is amazing.

Whos streaming now?
Hi everypony :$
After the scene at 8.04, let us never speak of derpy in that episode again.
Ello there, everypony
apparently I can't use the play/pause buttons or adjust volume
and now I can....that was wierd
I'm quite well, thank you.
lol
I kid.
You know, I suppose the stallions of Equestria could stand to be a bit more manly. However, this is a peaceful kingdom with a female monarch and a prodominantly female population. Masculinity might be a lost cause there.
Good point.
I think they just don't show manly stallions in the show much.
Oh hay, I forgot that I need to work on my story, need to get my 5th chapter finished, and complete 3 more chapters by the end of TODAY.

Don't you just hate it when you think faster then you act?
People tend to hate Rarity.
#alexxm
Why, both are fine, really
Rarity, Applejack, A rivalry.
?
Wut?
05the reallyt defining difference is that this feels like an actual song
Oh come on are we again in the best pony argue?
We're talking about the fans behind the ponies.
Oh well then...
She sure does deserve more fans.
Celestia* damnit.
Celestia is one of my faveorite ponies.
/me is blown away by the volume
HIYA EVERYPONY
I don't even...
I hope you understand that sentence.
Wow dude...celestia
I've read it somewhere, don't remember where. Don't know if it even was official.
Also, someone said that Derpy has the longest wings.
Time is... 7:48 am.
It kinda makes sense to me.
Those are some huge-ass wings o__o
OH my... Dem wings
Woah, them wings....o_o
Geez...
You aren't jealous, are you, RD? :D
i think the wings are just about right :)
-.-
Its not the best...
It's a neologism I don't think it would work out pretty well
Time is... 7:54 am.
naw...notgeil a known term? I guess not huh?
Wait, what?:D
I like how the wings are much taller than the pony's overall height.
7:55 am. Show begins in five minutes.

Okay. I knew it was not going to happen. I just wanted to give people hope.
Why are you talking about Derpy all of sudden?
Derpy is now canon

right?
Svensker er så rare!!!
Derpy is not retarded guys, stop dissing her
Nopony should do it
But unforunatly some ponies did
For example a friend in deed (i think)
Derpy cant die. She was alive before she was even canon
Talking derpy is never coming back. :(
cause now its picking on blondes
05setting up
I said TALKING derpy, not derpy alltogeher.
D3?
We don't know!
We got a whole fandom backing and loving Derpy, and the animators know that :)
****NO DERPY POSTS AFTER THIS LINE*******
Because it's over.
Unless he proves me wrong atleast.
I do not care if Derpy's voice is changed, I just want her to remain of the same and orginal character that she was before.
