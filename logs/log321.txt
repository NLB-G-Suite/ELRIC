I thought it was just acid
8bit remixes have better quality
NOW YOU FALL.
whoops
And now to help cope with the stress, she eats some mushrooms from under a tree
And see how far down it goes. . .
this would be quite entertaining on lsd
That Quin was a great guy... I have great expectations of you young one. Now here, have a muffin.
Oh, i have to go! I'll be late if I don't hurry. I'll see you all soon. ;)
RAWRity: you are REALLY stealing NC's stuff

"Herpderp, just gonna get dangerously close to this hole"
THE END
I would be so depressed to be her

Alice in wonder land + Dubstep = wut
how do you fall that much by leaning forward a little bit
its a harp
Luna: oh THAT game...didn't SB give you that game?

/me dissappears
Dumbass

She fell, honest
11,01AT the end of the movie, she'll be in a straightjaket with a hole in her head.
Feels and goes through the same stuff as in the story up to now.
LOSER
My GF went as Alice for halloween last year
Can't wait for HIHOOF to drag his drunk ass to the computer. He's the life of the party.
*accepts greatfully*

And then she falls to her death. The end.
Shizuka: imagine THIS on set
and then she dies THE END
Piano

Moshakra, in where shes going, anythign is possible.
hmmm, this probably looked brilliant in 3D
/me plays the piano
SPLAT
still needs more acid
Look at dat CGI
Would've been shorter if she just hit the walls on the way down.
teleport isn't very effective
/me slpas Colt_of_Personality and Dirt around a bit with a large trout (three stooges style)
kk
how long is this fall?
Indeed
How does she get out of this alive
Slow fall Alice!! Slow Fall!!!
Where is the levitating nest of dethorned roses?
instead of cartoony, which it is
And then she's paralyzed. *roll credits
Act nice now!

Dat fall damage.
MOst likely
For, once. I think shes on enough acid
bounce
Bang...clonk...derf...smack...flump.

This is what the inside of an Aperture Science portal looks like.
OH GOD lORDcELESTIA.
Stupid spoilers ruining the whole movie
ouch
ka-thud
twilight can only teleport like what.... 2 inches?
SEEMS LEGIT.
This reminds me of that beginning scene in Majora's Mask...

Roll credits.

Rawrity what is it that you don't like about this movie?
yo hair is crazy girl!
alice: made of unobtanium
At some point one wonders if Tim Burton is just always High
Eff logic?
Silly Ziltoid, physics aren't real.

She's a troll.

coolness that defies gravityyyyyyy!
it's sort of like hitting leaves when you fall in a forest
She fell through the CEILING
whoa
she had armor couchin
Also, I saw this in 3D when it came out... it didn't work that well
^That
cushions the fall
Pinkie must be here....
Physics is the lauguage of nature
ASK ME WHAT IT MEANS! WooHoo!*bounces around like Daffy Duck* WooHoo!

hmm, dissapointing all around then
I am Uad. Very.
I'm in the minority I think when I say that Wonderland was not inspired by drugs

That's one kickass bed then

locked
the earth is flat
Meanwhile: yeah.
1,3~3D is largely overrated
RainbowcrashNBurn: ninja'd

I think you need an Iadblock
alice defies gravity
This entire film was practically crafted to try and pander to the dissacociated teenage crowd that had become Burton's most avid fanbase.
I see a negative zero on top
Yay, now I can watch, what'd I miss? :D
This might as well be discords land
13silly alice just call up the console und door.unlock
More like:
the world is round there is no up or down1 :O
pick the lock
Wonderland? Physics? Pfft the world is round there is no up or down.
somebody make Pinkie Pie Alice
Oh hey, this must be Tim Burton's attempt at destroying a children's classic, yes?
SCREW GRAVITY IM PINKIE PIE
also eeyup
Pinkie actually escaped from wonderland to ponyville
kick the door down!
Yeah it was inspired by weird math
post all the space
Shoulda brought some lockpicks, Alice.
Get me to that rabbit hole then hank!
Kurra: Everything. Even the plot.,
she should have skilled lockpicking
Discord, do you have anything to do with this?
iam sure about that
Screw gravity, i see huge-ass bunnies with clocks.
Because making stuff for your fans doesn't make sense.
Lol! Iweywrt, sooo true
So, does this mean she's in China now?
It wasn't inspired by drugs.
Shizuka: quit making references few people understand
alice has coolness that defies gravity
because kirzstryfe
Kurra: Everything.
NOOOOOOooooooo.....
I might.
rainbowkitten
Wrek will unlock your doors
Need ot find the dongeon key.
Everypony knows that Fairy Tales were MUCH creepier when they were originally written
she must have had the 1/2 fall damage perk from heavy armour tree
Hm?
it also commits the insufferable crime of being boring as a sack of dirt.
13but i like making obscure references :<
oh hell yeah
This is the kind of room gamers get stuck in for hours
THE PLOT! IT THICKENS!
Just use a lockpick Alice.
lol i just wanted your screen to beep
/me Spikeyells
eeyup
unfortunatle disney ruined that
0,14needs more noclip, amirite?
I love how she is not panicing
lol
drop kick the door open!
lockpicking=0
She must have Dead Silence Pro on
She gets progressively more attractive as the movie goes on... :/
boring movie for A
dumb bitch
05,15Snow White was REALLY messed up
lol
wasn't very obscure
Hansel and Gretel baked a woman alive
emangamer: That's the point of references
In any way
I guess her lockpick skills aren't high enough...
Moshakra, it didn't you spelled it wrong.
small
She broke all her lockpicks.
13like sheep that tip over und an asparagus has to get them back up
I don't
Use the skeleton key
Hell
No skeleton key
Master lock
lets play doors!
I always miss the begining of Movie night
That's a master level lock.
Dat home improvement
calvin you here
I just saw it.
Shizuka: Don't worry, I got the reference :>
Back
:P
I don't know what shes smoking, all I know is I want some
I look up a walkthrough after 10 minutes
Hey I can get $10000!! no way
XP
It's like Pandora's box from God of War
That was a pretty uneventful way to chenge realities there
lockpicking skill has increased by 5
what if she died in the hole
boss key
Small door? No problem
You're right. She gets beaten up a bunch
and this was all a dream
She could fit, if she weren't a fat PIG
eh.
Seriously, am I the only one with lag?
alice is master of unlocking
1,3:p
im pretty sure she needed to push the doors open not pull lol
anyone notice she didn't try to push?
Shizuka: I do too but....they aren't "proper"
3D is just another tool that is great when used well but awful when used poorly
Shizuka makes awesome references
How funny it'll seem when she comes out among people that walk with their heads downwards.
Drink it.
:O
it's kay, nothing happened yet
"Drink Me"
No lag for me
did you know ALOT of the original Disney movies were alot darker in concept
Bust through it!
Discord's wet dream in a nutshell

What ?? No talking doorknob !! OUTRAGEOUS !
Meanwhile: there's making stuff to appeal to your fans, and then there's outright pandering to the point where it becomes almost insulting.

She must have returned the skeleton key to the Twilight sceptucle

Whoah
This isn't a trap at all
What company?
Oops, she forgot the key.

Drinks it and then her clothes come off.

uhhhh
HOW THE EFF DOES THAT HAPPEN?!
I knew it was roofies
And then her dress crushed her. *roll credits
It's the difference between putting derpy in the occasional shot/cameo, and outright just having her sit there and spout memes about muffins for 22 minutes.
well, not naked it seems
I'm not getting any lag here.
wtf costume change
so it was acid...
:(
climb the table
11,01And everyone thought she would be naked.

I don't understand the physics in all of this.

She will keep doing that till she finishes this won't she?

I am suddenly reminded of the anime take on the Alice in wonderland story...
you would think she would be strong enough to break those damn things

Did you know Tim Burton tried to make the Cheshire cat intimidating because he's scared of cats?
cheshire cat's ALWAYS the best part
Ponies are hippies.
evaporating skills, computer hacking skills
she's MAD
the smile doesn't really creep me out
big head = big ego

Chesire is best cat.
Hippies smoke

politics are related
his face would scare me if i saw this n 3d
it's actually cute

Dermathil: I know a thing about symbolism but none of that seemed symbolic
I think mr Fry is the only reason I went to see this at the cinema

Dermathil: I'm not complaining it isn't original. I'm saying that, from a story perspective, this has no real purpose. It doesn't advance alice any, nor does it accomplish much outside of showing us that, yes, all these characters are psychotic.
Tim Burton is still total boss..
Suddenly, Bridget the Midget.
/me noms Saikon's caps lock key
:)
inb4 tf2
They could make it a Horroe film!

And then worked for Valve

I hope he has a good supply of mercury in there
That awkward moment when you're flaming gay and a women swoons over you.

O_O
13he's painting an unusual?
Johny Depp likes TF2
*horror
the hatter with me
he makes hats for insane people of all types!
Those eyes...
mmmm, morphine
lol
what's tha hatter?
Sudden RAGE!
No, he's setting an unusual on FIRE!
Ehhhh the whole wonderland thing is appealing to alot of people but never really appealed to me
The use of Pinkie Pie on POWs is banned by the Geneva Convention.
Hat rage
He Mad
Hats on fire.
But if you eat mah keys I cant use em
what's he remaking next? the wizard of oz?
RAGE
Suddenly, rage.

RaGE

Turns out hes a crack head...
correction: TF2 likes Johnny Depp
You're tearing me apart, Alice!
I'm fed up with this world!
hes got the RAGE
hes not mad, hes Mad
Raaaage
Bipolar Hatter
I should think so
the only reason I'm really here is for the chat
^
first beer of the night :)
ragequitragequitragequit
Poe wrote on both
His eyes would have to be red
Rage

TF2 rage quit
he's hat! he's really hat!
Closterphobia.
RRrrraaaaaAAAAAAAggggE:)
....Your the mad HATTER
13YOU DON'T SAY
I know I do
I think he realized that he's not supposed to actually make hats
I wouldn't even mind it much if the characters were interesting. but all the Hatter does is, well, this, and Alice's entire personality is made of styrofoam and white bread.
Yep your mad.....
>_<
he's slightly mad
Dat crowded.
he just needs a hat
a mad hatter going mad? you don't say
Zecora: Have you gone mad!?
And that's a bad thing?
/me jumps on SuperBrony64's plot and noms his tail
Eeeyup
Most remakes of anything is bad.. This one is surpriingly good though
umad Hatter?
Does that make me craaaazzaaay??
Clausterphobia. Fear of Santa Clause.
11,01I don't say?
Law bonkers....
I'm into it a little but not a lot. But yeah, mostly here for the chat too. :P
nope, you were BORN mad
and then they fucked
LOL
and then they kiss
Bonkers is an offical medical term
She's from a military family probably
.....
Eynope!
BONKERS!
that makes me.... happy :)
So then I'm a really good person?
Too much Mercury
Awesome :D
traded the ghastly gibus
The best in bed that is.
The hat makes him more sane
3Wait all the best people are mad?
This movie is just bonkers.
1,3all the best people are crazy, movie said it ^_^
and then nothing sexual happend forever
gonna have to take away his Queen albums
xD
Mercury, wasn't that invented in Scotland?
Your a horrible person...
where are my hats?
In a world gone mad, only the crazy are truly insane
I could never hate Dashy
10 more bucks if you find a single thing that has no CGI
Would explain the accent.
im here 4 both
I hope so
Space technically he went mad from the mercury used to make the hats
She COULD be from a guard family maybe. That'd be a cool backstory!
Her
I win
ALL THE PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN ARE CRAZY!
that means Derpy is best pony?
her hair
10 bucks for me
I feel like cake
so what is the difference between a raven and a writing desk?

Pfft, I'll do it

Plot demands nothing but the occaisional whip into line.
Actually, that isn't a bad idea. Have the dog come back from the dead, make it like Cujo, but more like a zombie slasher
Meanwhile: nothing ever has an actual point if you don'T care about the story.

Enough with the skyrim jokes.
The dragon was the only thing that kept them fearful of the queen dastardo
That's the queen's standard response to anything. Kind of like Celestia's "To the MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONN"
To the moooooooooooooooon
Everlasting_Joy: Hey
i love luna :D
its trollestia in human form
It's super fashionable!
His skull bouncing down the steps like a rubber band ball

@dastardo it's not that they hate her, but would YOU try and take on the chick that just killed the most badass thing in the land?
I still take offense.
I will admit the movie was fantastic looking enough
You useless son of a bitch.
crowngasm
Ah yes, the "Osama Bin Laden" approach to war: kill the one most visible villain and suddenly, there is no terrorism anywhere, ever again, and life is a magical happy place

Hello new LC member!
kinda weak
/me screems
Literally no one's in here D:
so yea, 4/10 at best. It's clear nobody on production actually cared about this, all they wanted was a movie all the super edgy teen girls would shill out to see. Actors phone it in, Elfman makes the same score he's been using for years, and the plot is padded to hell.
lol sounds like some messed up 16-bit era boss battle music
hey Luna I just got LoZ MM for my Wii, can you maybe try and stop it from crashing into Termia?
I can't even hear the voices :P
lol
Nein!
*ding

There.....are......four.....FACES

My theory, Discord's place in the world in maintainig the random natural functions of the world, celestial bodies wizzing through space, weather, seasons, etc. Didcord slacked off and focused on pure chaos when he got bored and decided to take over... My theory. That's why ponies have to run everything manually
Spike is best pony.

Mine!
Lyra: i agree

Berry Punch!
05,15Because you were inappropriate
I missed Screwball cause of ads ;.;
yes
I <3 you, Fluttercry
trollcord
See, they put aeiou in the show
Screwball is a Warner Brothers reference to the DoDo I think.
:D
She's always thinking of grilled cheese
mfw getting the scroll of harmony for the first time
And he put salt on snails
BUILD AN EXACT REPLICA
berrypunch is best
bonbon what the was that her

RAWRity: lulz
DisQord is best god

Rarity is best pony.
o false alarm
Poor berry just wanted salt
It must be backwards... she looked sober
Who couldn't like discord?
what Discord did was make the others not care.
Berry punch = pepper sneeze?
I would be excited in this world
He just ate Pinkie Pie's hair
yep
YYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSS
There goes Twilight's replica of ponyville

Que M bison

Derpy does more damage to town hall than Discord when he BREAKS gravity
Seriously, the animation in this show is so cool
this was the only scene I didn't like, discord laughing at twi 8c
THIS IS DELICIOUS
i figured everyone would choose pinkie rd or fluttershy so i joined this one
Berry Punch's sneezes can destroy cities when she's drunk
nnnope
Rarity is best pony

Successful Troll is Successful

I'm sorry Fleur, but with Lyra back you're no longer my hug victim
the one and only
As long as One of them was wanting to fight, if they were together they'd have pulled it off.
i accept ur challenge discord
Upset stomach? Indegestion??
Trollestia!
He has diarhea and constipation at the same time
ALL dat plot!
Trollestia is about to strike
make it stop
is it me or does it seem like discord a his own war with twilight, not celestia
My friend Mitch is obsessed with Fluttershy
poor spike
Picante chicken flavor with soy and sriracha
Discord is much more effective Villain than NMM
BLARF
Spike died a sad death from vomiting to death
2570 this.

Of course, I would much rather hang out with Luna, DisQord would be fun to hang out with too
Discord must be the one making the ads popup...
you didn't use the TPS report cover
:$
so many letters... so many cancelled episodes!
this is not spike's episode
are you sure that Lyra is the Lyra you remember MrDrProfIshBestPony?
so my questions is this: if everypony became the opposite of their elements because of discord, and twilight's element is magic, what did discord's magic do to her?
GOD...DAMN...ADS!!!!!!!!!!!
Heartburn? Thry new Tums, now in Dragon Strength!
I remember that...I remember that one too.... 8crying*
blah blah
tom

Next time I want to call in sick at work I'll tell them I'm barfing flaming letters
this is when it turns out grey scaled ponies was to save money?
He has... *sunglasses* the speaks.
SPIKE ABUSE
Lyra` is best poni.
that's why she sent them back
How many weeks has she already been there by this point?
You know, if her element is magic, why can she still use magic while discorded?

Discord is color blind
False. The baloon creates air resistance and acceleration gives the illusion of weight.
;)
anti-chaos force field go
well I don't. Because some things just can't be rated with numbers and besides words are better to describe stuff.
BUBBLE!
never noticed how the glass gets full from top to bottom...oh,and the fact that he drinks the glass XD
Also, I wonder where Screwball went after Discord dissapeared.

Pride before the fall
Nittany_Discord: the one flaw in his plan...but other than that, he is the best villan ever
He really dosn't understand what Twilight is.
I love drinking glass
his overconfidence
I love little details, like how the bubble returned the ground to normal
Stinkomanfan: back to wherever Discord brought her from
StinkomanFan: she reverted back to Derpy
he thinks they are still "grey"
lol DisQord reminds me of Kefka here
how is that possible sshe restored the ground
yeah I wish this wasn't how he got beaten
i swear, if they were humans this could be an epic fantasy film plot
Oh Pinkie!
Your overconfidence is your weakness.
