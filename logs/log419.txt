Scene 24\
That bridge... it looks SO familiar...
/me throws a stuffed rabbit in LunaTheBeloved's general direction.
Kandarihu thank you for saying that
5 questions
thats when developers actually cared about the gameplay instead of JUST FUCKING GRAPHICS
3=5
No, fifteen questions.
theres a tree
^
"Look, it's the old man from Scene 24!"
freefall29: Diablo 1.
/me catches it and throws it back at Meanwhile
It's multiple-choice.
I already did that Meanwhile
"abortions, abortions should be for free at wal-mart"
IT IS CORRECT!
Eternal peril.. seems legit.
Set chatto +m to aoid spoilers
Bronysith: They dont just care about FUCKING GRAPHICS
Any one else get any s1 ep2 flash backs?
Ahhhh, fresh meat!

Thank u

that wasnt so hard
That. Was hard.
Yay lancelot
lol
"WHAT...is your name?" "WHAT...is you quest?" "WHAT...if your favorite color?" "Right. Off you go."
THATS EASY
Seems legit
LunaTheBeloved: Can't decide between blue and pink.
K_A: what's the point in watching this iconic comedy movie if every good part and line gets spoiled right before it's heard?
Bronysith: Nor have I seen the "This game has good grahpics so thus it is good!" arguement in ages either
Kickass Graphics + Horrible Gameplay = fail game.

For those of you thinking the ending was extremely random: When Monty Python couldn't come up with a good ending to a sketch, they would simply have a police officer storm in and demand that the sketch should end. So they decided to do the same thing in their movie. (:

This episode wasn't that good, i don't like how the mane 6 don't try to talk to RD at any point, they immediatly plan the fake hero thing
xD
:O
Spkie's a Ghost!
I think he was lost in the fists at that point.

giggle at Spike
A cutie mark of something that foals should rightfully not have anything to do with implies a very messed-up foalhood.

05,15This episode makes me hate RD SOOOOO MUCH
imagine if this episode had been the season finale... man, all that fan rage
Lol Lyra
I recognize people's issues here with her friends not coming to her directly about the problem, but I blame that on pacing issues from limited time.
I GOT TEN SECONDS BITCH
LURA DID IT
Lyra will save her
Jacked Twi's Balloon!!
Lyra to save the day

Lyra to the rescue
Honestly, I think PYHD was worse.

She stole twi's balloon
PYHD?
Batmare
Oh shit its zorda

Rainbow Dash sounds like McGruber
nue she is smart but she is way too loving of herself
LUNA
or whtever his name was
Darkwing Duck
TUXEDO MASK...OH, MARE DO WELL
Dead....
but yeah overall this episode isn't great
I blame that on this episode's writer being new at the time, this was his first episode
How can you hate an episode with THAT character in it?!
in my book if you get angry you lost against it
Meanwhile, it took me 3 seconds to find you :3
holy turnips

So it's okay i guess
Heres the annoying part of this episode

Pfft.
0,14ikr?
NEVER MADE SENSE
Oh, shut UP, Mayor
and the mayor shows up..
Lession learned, Dont let the Mayor name things
11,01Hi Purple Pony.
I have suddenly forgot about Rainbow Dash's heroism
DarkHoof Mare
Suddenly Mayor

CORRUPTION, NO?
0,14just look for the SHINING MUSTACHE OF GLORIOUSNESS

http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/476/
This has to be the wost ep
Stupid other main 5. Taking RD's glory. ;.; THats what couldve gotten her into the Wonderbolts
It is an awesome name
Also, the Mayor was in on it.
badum tish
puuuuunnnz
oh put your hoof down
wow i missed the whole movie. was it a good movie?
Dohoho! That pun
I actually liked Putting Your Hoof Down.
Mayor Mare dye's her hair
ahahahaha
Rarity's dad?!
yes it was
bus fail
again?
05,15But yeah....I kind of really don't like Rainbow Dash
..It suddenly occurs to me, that the Mayor was in on the plots behind the Mare-do-Well.
Woah

i think it is AJ because of the hat

not rarity's dad
Oh, THOSE are the credits!
"in on the plots"
Putting your hoof down is my favorite episode of S2 that isn't the finale.
Dear Princess Celestia: All your fans will abandon you at the slightest provocation.

twilight_sprinkle: I mean that people kept spoiling it for the people that had never watched it before
earth fetichist :S
shes BATMARE!
05,15This episode proves my theory that rainbow dash is worst pony
Hearth's Warming Eve was really good. Definitely in my top 10 of season 2.
Calcos323: i understood
Don't use your fancy mathematics to muddy the issue!
^
/me loads gun
fluttercry fluttershy is best
Now this scene I kinda have issues with.
00,10man ponyville has a messed up planing commision
ah
Why arent we doing Batman episodes anymore?
Bronysith: Math confuses anypony, especially the CMC/Rainbow Dash.:P
Construction always messes up
fluttercry: No. Just... no.
Construction ponies?
http://ponybot.net/pix/2745.gif
hahah see?
Fluttershy is my favorite pony. That is all.
fluttercry: Why....? (crying)
Just too high-tech for this setting, I think.
fluttercry: what have you done . . .
05,15Yeah...totally yeah
HUH
ponies are kinda dumb, aren't they?
electricity is CANON
Rainbow Dash is worst mane 6, but she isn't worst pony.
well its hard to build electronics with hooves
but fluttercry, RD is best pony
Besides, how does a random cliff end up in the middle of the town?
indeed.
NO CRANES
You know, Manehattan had skky scrapers
They should really have a crane operator with a crane as a cutie mark, instead of a box.
This is obviously the day with that love poison princess
Meanwhile..im gonna guess your the one in the back?
just go!
they don't have brains...
fluttercry, there is no best pony
They could of avoided all this.
Shut up and save the day
Meanwhile: What...
they ALL are the best pony
fluttercry: Fluttershy was worse in the Iron Will episode, and you dont have hate for her
Pinie Sense to the rescue!
Shamroc: Out of the howveer many are in the back?
Although I like the idea of earth ponies being construction workers and engineers.
I love this scene :)
ehEEeeh
me trying to convert someone http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2288/
yay
i think it is AJ because of the hat
Is it me or this episode makes ponyville look much more "technologically advenced" ? I mean, cameras, construction, a dam
the ony one with the stache Meanwhile..
Hacks....
Shamroc: Just look under the bar for a moustache.
Electricity was canon Ep 1 when Pinkie turned on the lights
/me doesnt like fluttershy or rainbow dash very much
batman music!
RX-78-SweetieBot: Why....
They have technology
05,15But you see, she actually is worst pony, because she's a complete C*** in this episode
pinkie
Narolas: They have a lot of cameras lol
That Anti-aimbot
hurr durr stfu i can fly
:O
fluttercry: She didn't make anypony cry
i CAN'T feel but sorry for TheRainbowDash........i mean yes, she was a little overconfident......but i guess so i would sometimes.
Watch out for THAT TREE!!
Narolas you right i agree
yeah, but normally she is... pretty nice
left! YOUR OTHER LEFT
(crying)
Since season one, they've had electricity, electric lights, hair driers.
Universal answer: It's magic, silly.
All that work
I'm guessing the unicorns made all the technology.
THE key word being SOUND
only in this episode does she become a bitch
fluttercry at least she didnt make fluttershy cry or feel bad
This Episode was so annoying
guys your makin TheRainbowDash cry
pwnt
She's OK. She really does do a lot of things worthy of praise
Dat face
one is boring, the other is far to self-absorbed
Dark92Enigma: Of course when you're the fastest pony in all of Ponyville!:)(
THE HELL?
she mad
hhaaaxx xD
05,15BTW I'm just trollin. RD is actually my 4th favorite pony
No thanks?
lol NOPE
dat crazy twi theme
Wow...
No, unicorns don't seem to use tech because they have magic.
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2005/
Kandarihu: Because they totally are not overly adva--ah, screw it, I'm overdoing this racism debate.
I know deliopen, it just seems a bit more modern in this ep, i guess it comes from the marvel-hero inspired story
And RD gets the best faces
I think the earth ponies are the engineers
Why is everypony hating on this episode? D:
fluttercry Oh you ;).
DocSane, do they have computers even...?
Midnight_Fyre true
RD is my.....5th favorite
Narolas: Makes sense, yep.
Hydro-electricity is canon.
Why does this exsist?
They have video games
the only problem i have with the technology is the cranes
Im not an RD fan, and i enjoy it.
They have a dam?
ALL THE PONIES ARE MY FAVORITE PONIES
WTF RD?
Soarin >> RD
TheRainbowDash Naturally!
heh, same luna
lol RD
ah crap
I imagine hardcore RD fans hate this episode
just sayin
Hoofer Dam!
Dark92Enigma: Eeyup.
fluttercry: You're so cute when you're twolling! :)
HowToFryChicken: Twilight has an analog computer, it seems. With LEDs!
except the bitch fillies
and the video games + cranes
11,01RD, you broke it.
SPLOOGE!
You made things WORSE
yeah bronysith. all ponies are awesome
they suck
stupid..
Dam!
0,14...that feeling when I've actually patted myself on the back before
and thats how Ponyville got washed away
LeeroyWingkins: Well....umm...kind of.
SPLOOOOOOOOOOGE!
you talking about the cutie mark crusaders?
XD
Then you almost DIE
Hydroelectric dam in Ponyville
freefall29 Bronysith
Well, the Flim Flam Bros powered their machine with their unicorn magic.
RD is my 6th. Since I keep the mane 6 in the high spots.
worse ... or better?
Where is Lyra now?
K_A, do they even know what binary number coding is?
its funny how they always seem to build towns at the foot of a dam
which I can understand
wait. was that a purple clown fish... in fresh water?
Haha i dont like her less, just beacuse of it x(
freefall29 no dt and ss
if the dam already broke, wouldnt the water already have flooded ponyville?
TUXEDO MASK!
05,15but seriously it took me until the reading episode to move her up. this episode tarnished her for a long time
ALL THE MAGIC
Do my math homework twiley, im a lazy ass -.-
She/He was a Unicorn all along
When I first saw this episode I thought it was Luna or Trollestia
oh, yeah dt and ss are assholes
I remember this part, the purple magic gave it away for me~
and yet she couldnt lift a cake
/me hugs Fluttershy "Mine
Wait!
^
Pinkie > Twilight > Rarity > Flutters > Rainbow.
um what about the flood of water
^^
at this point mare do well is an alicorn, maybe celestia?
HowToFryChicken: Maybe that *is* their number system. We have 10 fingers; they have two front hooves.
"you made the fires worse!" "worse, or better?"
Mare-do-Well is Princess Cadance!
Nyria: Same...lol
I remember this part confusing me till the next one
But she is not the only one with purple magic.
K_A, you are a smart one.
I think that was what displeased the fans in this ep, you don't feel bad for RD because she IS acting stupidly, and the mane 6 don't try to talk :/
Now I wanna know, will there ever be another episode with Mare Do Well?
you must pass
Applejack is left out because that's how Applejack works.
Meanwhile: And Trixie is above Pinkie I assume
Meanwhile: thats very close to mine
strong agile and magic and flying
You'll see why not.
11,01Ponies count in base 2.
0,14Mare-Do-Well is...all of us
Silly RD, wings are not legs
Then MMDW became OP
0_o
This episode just ruined Rainbow Dash's image...what a disgrace for the creators to even show this...
0,14she lives on in our heart!
Now I figured it out
pete
RD>Twilight>Rarity>Others change places a lot
there's only one thing to do RD. You must KILL HER
who is pete
I realized this before it ended...which kinda sucked :d
0,14*hearts!
05,15RD was just TOO arrogant in this episode
Therefore ponies are robots.
Mare-Do-Well is Princess Cadence
05,15I couldn't get over it
pete is CANON
Here's a question that left me uneasy.........WHAT IF MARE DO WELL ACTUALLY EXISTED!?????? What if it was...............LUNA!
MMDW? M-Mare Do Well?
dat modest twi
So was the rest of main cast
If life were fair, this scene would be cut.
She should have seen the trick here, magic + horn = royal family :p
mips.tv is WORST PONY.
TO DIE FAW
luna = maredowell?
http://ponybot.net/pix/1227.png
ok, if i HAD to rank a few pinkie pie > spike > twilight > rainbow dash> fluttershy > rarity > and apple jack
so much modesty
I want Mare Do Well in season 3
I dont like this ep JUST because of this part.
MAWDIST
this scene annoyed me
(Hitting my head against the desk now...)
Pinkie>Twi>Rarity>AJ>RD>FS
You're to arrogant of ponies!
"A family tradition, haha!" EXCEPT THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO LEAVE.
SaxyPretender: you ever see that sad pic of that filly with the homework assignment?
Before Celestia and Luna, it was the duty of all unicorns to control the movement of the sun and moon. Then the Winged Unicorns came along and took over that task. So creation of basic technology for Earth Ponies and Pegasi became their new purpose.
0,14eenope
I thought this scene was funny. :\
XD
I refuse to rank. I just <3 Fluttershy.
please stop writing walls of text
Idk if I can find it...hang on.
she aint jealus, she mad
really jelly
I'm just a jealous guy....
sentence pls <3

Then RD became so jelly she gave a pony an obsession
Twi>Pinkie>Flutter>AJ>RD>Rarity
I'll MAKE YOU ALL PAY!
Writing on IRC?..
"Ahahaha, we're making you insecure."
oops
K_A, problem is they doing the exact thing they're trying to teach RD not to do
lol FillyFlam
sometimes I feel like I'm the only guy in the chat who has spike in top 3
IRC is for HACKERS
EonMastor: I thought that was the joke.
"darnit, nobody is dying for me to be heroic!"
0,14but spike's not a pony!
Me when I try to find important things
freefall29 thats because spike is not a pony
I forgot Spike existed until you just named him#
That's a good thing
Calcos323: it's like smuggler ships meeting at sea
oh no...
And the point.
SHE HAS POT
Ha, this scene....
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/22329/1/Pinkie-Watches-Paint-Dry/Pinkie-Watches-Paint-Dry
POT!?
um no she is not she is pissed because everyone loved her ONE TIME and then she came and screwed it up
RD feels out of character :<
ARREST HER

She must be like 90 years..

wow this is annoying
Peanut butter jelly time
bullshit, it was a twist top
lol RD
ponyville confirmed for peanut butter
uuh... thanks xD
Unicorns are OP. NERF THEM. BUFF EARTH PONIES
lol milking it
this episode wouldve been much better if they changed a few things about the concept. Like, MDW didn't need to be a vigilante, just a rival of dash. that way she could still be outshined, without having to put in a lot of strange natural disasters for the sake of it, also, it would allow dash to be arrogant to some point
you helped open peanut butter
plot
SEE PURPLE MAGIC THAT IS NOT BEING USED BY TWILIGHT
We need to name peanut butter unicorn
Hahaha:D
:P
wat?
SAVE THE LAWN
That would've been a good time to give her a wise talking-to actually.

Pinkie Pie = greatest hero
Ghosties: So little time.:D
I like to imagine that filly walking down the street one dim afternoon watching the mane 6 in a cafe, when a burglar steals some chicks purse and runs off, then Mare-do-well flies out of nowhere and drop kicks the bastard. And the filly has a sense of meaning returned to her heart.
Holy crap, that "High Hopes" Drawing was awful!

A pair of pants
I remember an angry fanfic starting at the ending of this.
I'd be inclined to believe yes.
YEah, you should never rub your accomplishments in anybody's face, except for when we did that exact thing, but it was okay then.
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4323/
Pants. That are sassy.

Ugh Ghosties, you dissapoint me...:|
what is the movie about?
AND its an Elementary school
lvl 83?
ok time for chrono trigger but i can still chat
and it's in German apparently
3Ghosties, K_A, The tomato fruit is consumed in diverse ways, including raw, as an ingredient in many dishes and sauces, and in drinks. While it is botanically a fruit, it is considered a vegetable for culinary purposes (as well as by the United States Supreme Court, see Nix v. Hedden), which has caused some confusion. The fruit is rich in lycopene, which may have beneficial health effects.
04This...already looks disappointing
tl;dr
11,01brony_158: Heeeeeeeey, what going oh-on?
Woah...that green wall...
SlurryMoon dat text wall
but no sound?
Oh, this is great.
go on young gamer, may the awesomenss of chrono trigger be with you
05,15was this made in powerpoint?

ah ok
This is probably my favorite movie I've seen on Bronystate so far
SlurryMoon: True about the lycopene, but it is totally a berry.
Bronystate problems.
04Slurry is BronyState's best mediator for culinary cuisine
no, it was made in Word
What is this movie about? Is it a comedy? Drama?

This is a good film just give it a chance
/me steals Shamroc's wallet back
This is like that CITIES OF GOLD show Luna showed us isn't it?
11,01Of course he does.
Speaking of Luna, what happened to her?

According to Wikipedia, it is supposed to be pretty good.
/me limps slowly away
here ya go *hands wallet to Shamroc*
....I'm....bleeding hrrobily now...
I better pay more attention to the movie.
For a movie to be WMC'd, do we have to finish it?
00,10shame it wont happen cause it seems people like it
Food! Food Everywhere, but no knowledge to hunt
Would you rather watch Epic Movie? >.>
horribbly*
*According
2,14 are you kidding? that would mean we can't show it tomorrow

Lolz
ValtheJean: Fair enough.

G 3.6... not bad as a replacement
04Because it IS something you watch in class
Are these real historic figures?
Sorry....all those Organ trail times made me unpossessable
2,14 I was forced to watch this in my film class
You seen it, Scoot-Scootaloo?
GabeMaid64: Don't joke about something like that.
Are we actually WMCing this?
/me heals Shamroc
....ok I admit it I like QWOP
2,14 SO NOW YOU ALL MUST WATCH AS I WAS FORCED TO
freefall29: the mods?

freefall29: Hmm......I got no phone with me right now.:D
WMC?
nope
Oh my.
Wait: this is an educational film?
NO we can WMC this now
ValtheJean: its filmm class, what did you expect, die hard?

WMC?
Film class? You'd think that in a Film class you'd see GOOD movies
I'm bored
So....much......talking
I'm not a fan of Herzog. I find his style dull.

Elvish?
I wouldnt WMC this, it may be extremely slow in pace, but so far it has a pretty good representation of what the conquitadors faced in exploring new lands
GaeMaid64: Yes, we must.
Oh, so it is Pizarro.
I swear, if you WMC this I will nominate Fitzcarraldo, which is made by the same director and main actor, but is an hour longer
More water..
Val troll harder
Homo Saxiens?

ValtheJean: I applaud you for the best movie ever
ACTION GUYS

ACTION

SHIT'S GOING DOWN IM AT THE EDGE OF MY SEAT
ValtheJean: Did you take your medicine this morining?
0,14BRB
<3
SHITS GOING DOWN

ValtheJean: I assume that was said in the Emperor's voice.
Next week class, Louis & Clark Expidition
04SO MUCH ACTION, THAT FIRE CAME BURSTING FROM MY EYES

ValtheJean Yes. Yes we do.
04Right now? In chat? Nahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Murrrr
That can't be good.

Seaponies ! help the conquistadors !
Damn, Lyra's in her bucket and not the River
/me prods LunaTheBeloved in the crook of the neck.
SHOO BE DOO
THE MOVIE... SO... INTRUIGIN
11,01Lyra be chillin'.
Midnight_Fyre: It's... interesting
.. Meanwhile would you want to cook?
I hope the raft with the carriage is the first to topple
wow
brb, gonna go check out that EqD link
Tovler|depressed: I'm the same way. I could legitimately enjoy this.
we need a woman to do our cooking, its 19th century and all.
He has a parrot
No

THE ORGAN TRAIL
Perfect
Lyra says screw physics.
Just
YAY

You're thinking of Oregon Trail.
And suddenly the german speaking spanish conquistadors start singing SHOOBEDOO SHOOSHOONEDOO
I blme sxyprtndr
This is Organ Trail
lol
04Chapter 9: Stranded on the Moon
With zombies.
Chapter 9: This is chapter 9
lyra, taking that river like a baws
Not an eddy
organ trail?
Did he have a Jawbreaker?
...oh is that why you said shotgun?
You don't really get the full effect watching it this way
what year is it?
Row left - No your other left
And then they drowned and joined the Sea Ponies.
2012.
Poor Spainards! :(
11,01Chapter 9 is Moonstuck?
This is like, Oregon Trail, Conquistador version
05,15Conquistadores can barely make it down the river. Lyra fords it like a boss
Note he talks like the "Indians" are non-people.
People, you don't know utter boredom till you've watched the movie The Flying Saucer.
this is pathetic, I'm more entertained by an animated pony wandering around the screen than the movie itself
I said shotgun Shamroc because I want the frost passenger seat.
Titanic 18: Chapter 10
Chapter 69: Something Finally Happens
parrot
oh ORGAN I thought you said OREGON
This is the middle... the middle of our stooooory...
but theres zombies..
11,01Lol Calcos323
04Chapter 10: That guy left our group
:(

then they drowned and there was much rejoice
pony_300: I'm far too easily enteratined by that.
Meanwhile's my second hand man, as always
Chapter 11: More Fucking Water!
Chapter 23: Someone takes a massive shit
Chapter 11: Chapter not appearing in this film
RX-78-SweetieBot, just got a bronze done in 15:30
LunaTheBeloved of course, cannot have the passenger seat, because I'm in it.
Even during Holy Grail.
I wonder if there acually acting
And I just wanted to rub that in.
Chapter 16: Chapter16
ugh tab broke
:(
DAMNIT SONG WHY YOU SO SHORT!
they sound so....concerned.
04Chapter 11: Wandering Aimlessly
ok. lets draw straws. shortest draw is used to lure zombies away from us.
OK............we're used to fast-paced stuff, but we need to calm down a little
That song is gonna play at my wedding After party
11,01I should read my Masters Thesis tomorrow in stead of this.
K_A: hmm, that might be my problem as well
No this is a documentary, of the actual event
i know
05,15Can I get in the car too. Save me from the boredom!
/me gets longest

Fluttercry and Shamroc it is!
11,01K_A it's fun, but hard.
hah!
Everyone seems so bored in this movie
Oh, no, wait, I get it. This movie is a metaphor for how our lives seem epic and important to us, but to the outside observer it's boring as all hell.
hey, it's the guy from jurassic park
aha!
Chapter 14: Bee
hmmm
SHOW US YOUR TITS
/me rests his feet on the dashboard and rests his back on the seat.
DAMMIT GHOSTIES I'M LAUGHING MYSELF TO DEATH
Did I just see a Seapony?
wait wait
/me saves fluttercry
hi Comradinski
told you they did tons of DRC post
2,14 lol Ghosties, normally I'd be disappointed with you, but that would honestly make this movie BETTER, believe it or not
Luna you're already in
/me kicks Meanwhile out
Chapter 14: Flies
11,01I've wrote the thesis and defended it. It's all done.

SaxyPretender, where is it!
shit, i forgot about movie night....
I totally just noticed that their is still a movie playing.
Good job
/me blocks freefall29 with the power of nope.
Maid_Discord: What's it about?
04Chapter 14: Film goes in reverse because of how slow it is
technically not normalizing
03was like "You want the voluem to have 2-3 in the orange"
03then after I'm done
/me throws freefall29 out
/me walks (forever alone)
/me jumps into the trunk
/me sits on the roof
11,01Lightning climatology.

03and I switched it back to the automated playlist
(its called agc)
Baysplosion
Chapter 15: Litwick shoots himself in the head
04Chapter 15: They forgot to put lights on the set
I just finished my Thesis dissertation as well
05,15Val....how long is this movie?
03the engineer walks in goin g"wait, what? Why is it so high? You don't want it in the yellow"
Meanwhile, half way we trade seats?
03I'm like um, OK
units or GTFO
*new
Like last time?
About 90 minutes
chapter 15 : theres a strom
03units?
So is the title of this "The Wraith Of God" or is the movie itself "The Wrath Of God", because it sounds like this is pretty painful to watch
2,14 it doesn't end fluttercry
Deal.
Thank God. This movie is only 90 minutes long.
03well
Unless one of us dies
units!
Maid_Discord: Sweet, so you're in meteorology? Physics?
2,14 because if haunts your dreams
LunaTheBeloved: im gonna say that you 2 end up killing each other
03top of the green is 0dB
water again
11,01Chapter i: The imaginary chapter.
2,14 it never leaves
I was prepared for this giant 3-hour epic.
Hrm.
03orange means you're +dB
04Chapter 16: COME GET YA DEAD
Though as I recall, you wandered off.
>.>
Chapter 16: Go back to chapters, you lose a turnn
And so they all died.
<.<
Chapter 404: chapter not found.
00,03L4D2 time! Who wants to play?
Chapter 15: Possible plot?
OH THANK GOD. ONLY 90 MINUTES.
2,14 every waking moment, you see it in the corner of your eyes
03goes 2, 4, 6, 8 and then it screams at you if you hit 10
03XD
All dead, movie over.
*two
Chapter 17: I die because I'm laughing too hard
You told me there was chocolate....
03I kept mine around 6
93 minutes, Gott sei Danke
SO I take it I am the only one who has actually seen this multiple times?
This is HARD MODE, so don't think we'll make it so easily
11,01K_A: I have an undergrad in physics and masters in meteorology.
Out in that field...
03but apparently you want it to peak at 0
0,14they all ded
03(like most audioz)
lunathebeloved has to be saved. we may not run into other humans for months
DED
Chapter 15: They all deed
Chapter 18: and then there were 6
2,14 you hear the cries of fear, gurggling as they drown in their own sleep-induced saliva
So yah, it looks like Lyra's having fun
TPK!
Shamroc: Make no mistake, LunaTheBeloved may steal my legs, poke me, and throw me on the ground, but I'll still kill you first given the option.
"i find that strange"
well shit happens
zzzzz.....*wakes up* .....oh there sleeping .....zzz

2,14 I think Ghosties has unintentionally made our next meme
11,01I have to watch chat.
/me hugs LunaTheBeloved back.
Afro powers activate!
03and the soundboard is a bit odd in that if you keep both L/R equal, the right is louder

04Chapter 18: OH SHI-
DocSane: i saw it
Indeed he did
lol
11,01And keep the room clean.

HAHAHAHA
I have given upL4D Co op untill <y skills improve. Unless you need a bad player :P
lol

I'll be sure to look it up some time, Derpy

That was during my senior year.

ValtheJean: Chapter 14764367: unless we WMC
We all fled to that as soon as we saw it. xD

its only a flesh wound

SLOATH!
AWH
05,15WTF IS THAT
Maid_Discord: Good point, those classes didn't have much O.D.E. stuff except in the proofs. I ran into D.E.s (and Laplace transforms) later on in electric circuits.
whaat is it
Is anyone really watching this?
07a fair amount of radio stations do that
is that a sloth?
N'aaaw
Chapter 22: cute rat thingy
0,14baby sloth!

Eat it.
Looks like a ferret abortion.
Chapter 24: MUTANTS!!!!

Chapter 25: Horse tied to a cannon.
11,01Never did Laplace Transforms in E&M.
ell there LunaTheBeloved
:)
Do we have any pillows like, in the boot?
03there's just a computer they have running that we're supposed to pipe over the air if we're not live
0,14also, fun fact: Castile is the province where mainstream spanish (aka Castellanos) originated from
/me sits on LunaTheBeloved
11,01I think we did Fourier Transforms though.

Maid_Discord: Take my word, you didn't miss much.
03since, you know, the FCC doesn't like radio silence
fail
The rafts are gone!
Never Aguirre, never.
Am i the only one who thinks this movie is trippy?
Maid_Discord: They're effectively equivalent for circuit theory.
Lyra took the raft it seems.
/me throws frefall29 out of the car

Meanwhile we only had eight hours to scavenge so shut up
Crimsonpony98: No hablo ingles

No countdown today?

Maid_Discord: As do I (majoring in it), there are just something I don't like, and Diff Eq is one of them. However, a large part of that is the teacher.

03That was one of my big beefs with most radio stations, you hear a song you like and have no idea what it's called
WELCOME TO PITTSBURG

Chapter 23: Jim Carrey goes insane.
"Werner Herzog claims to have written the screenplay in two and a half days. He wrote a good portion of it while traveling with his soccer team, during games and on bus rides. Following one game, the team was very drunk, and the player seated behind Herzog vomited on his typewriter, ruining many pages of the script. Herzog was unable to salvage the pages, and tossed them out the window. He was also unable to recall what he'd written on them. "
Father?
aren't they a tad overdressed>
03yeah we have to use weather.gov
Yeah yeah I love Trixie rar rar rar
WOAH

Germans never retreat!
YESH!
Anyway, it explains so much.
FillyFlam :D
chapter 27: This is the new Titanic meme
so..... yeah
That explains a lot
Maid_Discord: Aw man, I always wanted to take quantum.
LunaTheBeloved for that you're in charge of scavenging me a pillow from Pitsburgh
11,01Quantum was fun.
DerpStar: 1945.

Shamroc, it's an RP the only affects come from the game we're playing

Yes
Yes, it was.
Nuuuuu, all the pillows are mine

I liked Epic Movie when I was a kid...
FINALLY ACTION
Maid_Discord: I knew a guy who was convinced it was nonsense. And he was in a physics class with me. He's not dumb or anything, either.
Hallo again, Lyra
I'll join you stinkomanfan

Another one
04Chapter 29: We used up our entire budget on those two gun shots
But arent radios supposed to make sounds?
And now they all die.
Mutiny.
DerpStar: <3's me
07that's what most DJs do
Shot through armor?
mixx dat sheiitt
red paint ahoy
11,01We're bored. Shoot people!
EPIC MOVIE FTW
What's the point of the armor then?!
03most radio stations have some sort of talking between songs
Chapter 30: Mass Homocide
Keep shooting
Armor fail
03it's just usually random crap like having listeners call in
Ghosties: Don't forget the tin-can costumes.
chapter 30: lol white people.
07either a crossfade or a mix
chapter 30: Ghosties is best book writer
homocide?
RX-78-SweetieBot coulndt we just use you for any radio needs or anything
SunderlandPony89 I'm echoing the sentiment of the crowd not the historical evidence that Germany displayed in 1810, 1912 and 1945

Um, armor was for when you fought with swords.

Ursa? Ursa Major?
SaxyPretender: /)
Lyra swimming through an afro.

lol Ghosties he did before
This movie makes me angry...
Maid_Discord: True, his cat analogy was intended as a counter-argument.
That guy was nuts
Dammit, Ghosties, never change

the guy on the left ...
StinkomanFan: go around it?
3wow...
/me rejoins the role play, this time serious
11,01I can dance to that.
04Chapter 34: Blonde man is not amused
0,14THE MUSIC OF MY FUCKING PEOPLE
has such a look ...
3he's a beast :D
Peruvian flute band! RUUUUN!@
You normally have 2-3 songs depending on song length between talk breaks
But mathematicians didn't like calculus either (for good reasons at the time actually).
THE SONG OF MY PEOPLE(!)
ok, i'm back
He failed to play the song of time
Should we sneak through or go gung ho?
Panpipes
Keep going
This is like Native Epic Sax Guy.
DIS MUSIC
We can dance if we want to?
11,01Really?
/me pulls his seat as far back as it'll go, sets the pillow on the seat and takes a nap.
FillyFlam: The main actor, Klaus Kinski, also fired a rifle at a group of extras who were irritating him and the directo took the gun away from him
IS BEST MUSICS
sneak through man
Waiting for a gunshot theat'll never come from a hero that doesn't exist...
EVAR
again StinkomanFan GO AROUND IT
Someone's having fun...
03Oh god, this song is way too overdriven
Too bad that didn't killed me twilight_sprinkle
04Chapter 35: We decided to film this guy playing his pan flute because we were on break and didn't have enough footage
0,5I need a hero!
I don't have enough money to use the mercs
He's really gotten into it.
0,14no like seriously
Sneak, try not to wake me up.
Not an option Shamroc
yaayyy more peruvian pan-flute bands.
Only good part of the movie
03whatever, next week I'll keep the volume down
Chapter 356: is this an intermission
11,01Why hate calculus?
turn that radio off, you will attract a zombie
0,14this is actually the music of the andes
0,5I'm holdin' out for a hero 'til the end of the niiiight
/me 11,01dances
Maid_Discord: Yep.
SNEAK IT IS
0,14<3 <3 <3
this flute scene needs to be made into a meme
lol Ghosties is best mod
it all sounds like the same note to me
07and it's between the breaks that you either announce the next 2-3 or sum up the previous 2-3
You know Simpson's Rule?
00,10wow catchy
3He's not so good
Dark92Enigma: Ill just say you died in a marching accident
3But yeah
03hm
/me is LordCelestia's hero
Chapter 37: 5 hours of this
07which is how they figure out what song it was
03I guess I can do that
/me turns off radio so zombies won't hear us
pony_300: Agreed.
Catchy
:D
The guy who invented it was a textbook writer who was against calculus.
Flute guy 10 hours
Oh dang, multiphonics!
Meanwhile...you must not know me..
03since I'm basically just using Winamp XD
/me turns radio back on
Maid_Discord: Have you taken anything dealing with group theory?
04Chapter 36:Pan flute broke, we cut away to some guy stabbing a wall of bars
I DO NOT SNEAK!
It's like Im really trapped in the jungle!
03except hopefully next week I'll have my laptop
The flute player is a retarded guy the director picked up off the streets of Lima or some big Peruvian city
Midnight_Fyre: Yeah. And apparently the director threatened to kill himself if one of the actors quit.
That piper isn't very good, is he?
I NEED MY BON IVER MAN!
03though the station computer is plenty capable of doing it
We made it without incident
/me snores vaguely in Shamroc's direction.
Ot
Shamroc: you do not infiltrate?
/me turns it down so zombies can't hear it
11,01Math?
nope
I can still hear it
5 hours oh the agony
11,01No.
Calculus is great
And the reason to be against it? It was based on the concept of infinitesimals, which weren't well-formulated until the 20th centurly.
05,15look at Caramel just sleeping in the corner....lucky colt
0,5He's gotta be strong and hes gotta be fast and hes gotta be fresh from the pan
Wasn't Calculus invented to explain physics?
otakon: nope
twilight_sprinkle (Thanks for nothing) You're welcome
0,5I need a hero!
It's funny because this bits of screwed up trivia are more entertaining than the actual movie.
okay WHAT is this movie about because I am lost
Yes, he threatoned to shoot Kinski and then himself if Kinski left
Awww Music over
Integration is extremely useful
this is a roleplay
otakon EVERYONES LOST
ugh, im taking Calculus next semester >_<
0,14it's about spanish conquistadors
but then again, I missed about 20 minutes of it
we really arnt trying

Help me Obi wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.
I know Isaac Newton made it pretty usefull

I'm in Calc 2 (out of 3) this semester.
You're my only hope..............OK, where do i click?

You're wondering who I am
It was pretty bad, a lot of work though. Linear Algebra w/ Matrices was a lot easier.

and vectors
0,5Since when? o.o
Calculus is easy once you understand the concepts
SNOWSTORM
Darf14: 4-10, depending on your affinity for math and the style of thinking it requires. For me, usually a 4, sometimes 7 or so because of the larger integrals.
Since always.

twilight_sprinkle: No, but there are certain identities such as the arctrig functions that are useful to know.
