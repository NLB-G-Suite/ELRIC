its not like RD would have listened to them anyway
lol no wings
*Duck
xD
Hot Air fail,.
SH
YEEEEEEEEEEELP
05,15This episode makes me hate RD SOOOOO MUCH
I recognize people's issues here with her friends not coming to her directly about the problem, but I blame that on pacing issues from limited time.
I GOT TEN SECONDS BITCH
LURA DID IT
Jacked Twi's Balloon!!
10 SECONDS FLAT
Honestly, I think PYHD was worse.
DAT MARE!
BAT MARE
She stole twi's balloon
PYHD?
Oh shit its zorda
pyhd?
LUNA
or whtever his name was
TUXEDO MASK...OH, MARE DO WELL
but yeah overall this episode isn't great
How can you hate an episode with THAT character in it?!
in my book if you get angry you lost against it
Heres the annoying part of this episode
her*
Pfft.
0,14ikr?

11,01Hi Purple Pony.

Good night people
Hm.
HMM, those are pretty strong bucking legs!
Mare :D
me trying to figure out algebra http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2685/
05,15This episode proves my theory that rainbow dash is worst pony
Hearth's Warming Eve was really good. Definitely in my top 10 of season 2.
^
/me loads gun
Now this scene I kinda have issues with.
Construction always messes up
Construction ponies?
http://ponybot.net/pix/2745.gif
hahah see?
Fluttershy is my favorite pony. That is all.
Just too high-tech for this setting, I think.
05,15Yeah...totally yeah
HUH
ponies are kinda dumb, aren't they?
electricity is CANON
Rainbow Dash is worst mane 6, but she isn't worst pony.
NO CRANES
You know, Manehattan had skky scrapers
just go!
they don't have brains...
They could of avoided all this.
they ALL are the best pony
Pinie Sense to the rescue!
Although I like the idea of earth ponies being construction workers and engineers.
ehEEeeh
me trying to convert someone http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2288/
Hacks....
Electricity was canon Ep 1 when Pinkie turned on the lights
/me doesnt like fluttershy or rainbow dash very much
They have technology
05,15But you see, she actually is worst pony, because she's a complete C*** in this episode
pinkie
That Anti-aimbot
hurr durr stfu i can fly
:O
yeah, but normally she is... pretty nice
(crying)
Universal answer: It's magic, silly.
All that work
I'm guessing the unicorns made all the technology.
THE key word being SOUND
only in this episode does she become a bitch
pwnt
She's OK. She really does do a lot of things worthy of praise
Dat face
one is boring, the other is far to self-absorbed
she mad
hhaaaxx xD
05,15BTW I'm just trollin. RD is actually my 4th favorite pony
No thanks?
Wow...
No, unicorns don't seem to use tech because they have magic.
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2005/
I think the earth ponies are the engineers
Why is everypony hating on this episode? D:
RD is my.....5th favorite
Hydro-electricity is canon.
Why does this exsist?
the only problem i have with the technology is the cranes
They have a dam?
ALL THE PONIES ARE MY FAVORITE PONIES
WTF RD?
heh, same luna
lol RD
I imagine hardcore RD fans hate this episode
just sayin
Hoofer Dam!
except the bitch fillies
11,01RD, you broke it.
SPLOOGE!
You made things WORSE
they suck
stupid..
Dam!
0,14...that feeling when I've actually patted myself on the back before
SPLOOOOOOOOOOGE!
XD
Well, the Flim Flam Bros powered their machine with their unicorn magic.
RD is my 6th. Since I keep the mane 6 in the high spots.
which I can understand
Haha i dont like her less, just beacuse of it x(
TUXEDO MASK!
05,15but seriously it took me until the reading episode to move her up. this episode tarnished her for a long time
ALL THE MAGIC
She/He was a Unicorn all along
I remember this part, the purple magic gave it away for me~
/me hugs Fluttershy "Mine
Wait!
^
at this point mare do well is an alicorn, maybe celestia?
"you made the fires worse!" "worse, or better?"
I remember this part confusing me till the next one
But she is not the only one with purple magic.
Applejack is left out because that's how Applejack works.
You'll see why not.
11,01Ponies count in base 2.
0,14Mare-Do-Well is...all of us
Silly RD, wings are not legs
0_o
This episode just ruined Rainbow Dash's image...what a disgrace for the creators to even show this...
0,14she lives on in our heart!
Now I figured it out
pete
RD>Twilight>Rarity>Others change places a lot
there's only one thing to do RD. You must KILL HER
I realized this before it ended...which kinda sucked :d
0,14*hearts!
05,15RD was just TOO arrogant in this episode
Therefore ponies are robots.
05,15I couldn't get over it
pete is CANON
MMDW? M-Mare Do Well?
mips.tv is WORST PONY.
christianism is CANON
TO DIE FAW
http://ponybot.net/pix/1227.png
ok, if i HAD to rank a few pinkie pie > spike > twilight > rainbow dash> fluttershy > rarity > and apple jack
I want Mare Do Well in season 3
I dont like this ep JUST because of this part.
MAWDIST
this scene annoyed me
(Hitting my head against the desk now...)
Pinkie>Twi>Rarity>AJ>RD>FS
You're to arrogant of ponies!
"A family tradition, haha!" EXCEPT THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO LEAVE.

And now they all die.

EPIC MOVIE FTW
What's the point of the armor then?!
03most radio stations have some sort of talking between songs
Chapter 30: Mass Homocide
Armor fail
03it's just usually random crap like having listeners call in
07either a crossfade or a mix

I am now
not suprised.
3This movie
This movie makes me angry...
05,15Can I kill someone yet?
:O
Now music

3wow...
04Chapter 34: Blonde man is not amused
0,14THE MUSIC OF MY FUCKING PEOPLE
has such a look ...
Peruvian flute band! RUUUUN!@
You normally have 2-3 songs depending on song length between talk breaks
But mathematicians didn't like calculus either (for good reasons at the time actually).
THE SONG OF MY PEOPLE(!)
ok, i'm back
He failed to play the song of time
Should we sneak through or go gung ho?
Panpipes
Keep going
DIS MUSIC
11,01Really?
/me pulls his seat as far back as it'll go, sets the pillow on the seat and takes a nap.
IS BEST MUSICS
sneak through man
Waiting for a gunshot theat'll never come from a hero that doesn't exist...
EVAR
Someone's having fun...
0,5I need a hero!
I don't have enough money to use the mercs
He's really gotten into it.
0,14no like seriously
Sneak, try not to wake me up.
yaayyy more peruvian pan-flute bands.
Only good part of the movie
03whatever, next week I'll keep the volume down
Chapter 356: is this an intermission
11,01Why hate calculus?
0,14this is actually the music of the andes
0,5I'm holdin' out for a hero 'til the end of the niiiight
/me 11,01dances
SNEAK IT IS
0,14<3 <3 <3
this flute scene needs to be made into a meme
07and it's between the breaks that you either announce the next 2-3 or sum up the previous 2-3
You know Simpson's Rule?
00,10wow catchy
3But yeah
03hm
/me is LordCelestia's hero
Chapter 37: 5 hours of this
03I guess I can do that

Oh dang, multiphonics!
Meanwhile...you must not know me..
03since I'm basically just using Winamp XD
/me turns radio back on
I DO NOT SNEAK!

We made it without incident
/me snores vaguely in Shamroc's direction.
Ot
11,01Math?
I can still hear it
5 hours oh the agony
11,01No.
Calculus is great
And the reason to be against it? It was based on the concept of infinitesimals, which weren't well-formulated until the 20th centurly.
Wasn't Calculus invented to explain physics?
0,5I need a hero!
Awww Music over
Integration is extremely useful
this is a roleplay
0,14it's about spanish conquistadors
but then again, I missed about 20 minutes of it
we really arnt trying
0,5I'm holdin' out for a hero 'til the mornin's liiiight
Help me Obi wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.

on a scale from 1 -10 ...how hard is Calculus?
We just finished a chapter that dealt with rotating functions around the y and x-axis
0,14I am enjoying the movie >.>
oh, I'm not then? I thought I was
0,5Hey hey hey
AHA
Hrm...

0,5Why the RP? This isn't an RP room >.<
/me starts flailing around with his katana "WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"
There are parts of Calc that make sense
The choice is clear: Shoot EVERYONE.
Calc is kinda hard, but kinda easy, depends on the part
/me loses a finger
Like derivatives and integrals
OH COME ON
I thought I was. I was having fun ya know
It was pretty bad, a lot of work though. Linear Algebra w/ Matrices was a lot easier.
^
and vectors
0,5Since when? o.o
Calculus is easy once you understand the concepts
SNOWSTORM
Since always.
Chapter 39: Not Quite 69
