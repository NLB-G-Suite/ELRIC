Spike just brings out the worst in everypony
Dat decimal
/me I'M BACK

8 I Think
twilight doesnt even recognize spike as a friend, he is a FRIGGIN SLAVE
The only reason why Fluttershy had 0.5WP the first time is because she chickened out right before she crossed the Amamometer
Dat Smell
dat smell

Averaging 40 wingpower I'd say.
Which is high.
makes sense :3
Spitfire's had a long night man, give her a break

No color Nitty?
RD, y u no stay in postion?
Pony math is confusding

Nittany: Aye, which is questionable too, since RD didn't have 40 wp herself and she's the best flyer in the batch. >_>

AFTER MORE WORK........i'm back again

i agree 2
Sad? Why sad?
Why does'nt applejack have her own song?
/me sings along
it makes me sad 2 idk why
realizing theres 6 episodes, 1 for each pony
00,10he did't do any thing to ad them
You could just simply die
Rainbow Dash is a tank now canon
nice!
I never acutally learned these lyrics (tries)
Rainbow won't look like a tortoise~
I like all the dresses, but i like Twilight's the most
for a Rarity episode
Awesome song
In before 20% cooler.
gasp
Everypony does not like their dress
SWANK
I never got why they didn't like the dresses
Twilight's dress <3
we didn't get a pinke ep yet, did we
They're nuts. Those dresses are awesome. >_:>
*>_>

I don't understand why they don't like them
http://i.imgur.com/DdEtt.jpg I NEED IT

Ponies not impressed, UNGRATEFUL!
Her motivation, her element, her passion

Nitpicky lot aren't they. >.>
Nice
PLUM GRATEFUL
Maybe they should try them on first
NOT APPLE GRATEFUL
RD is just outright mean

Blunt is painful, but I'd rather have blunt honesty over an elegant lie any day.

Dunno.

Apply ice to burn
element of sewing
Wut?

ow
wave of random critisizims
fluttercritic, is best part of this episode
take 2 for rarity
stitch by stitch
Even tho Rarity is my fav pony, I dont really like FS's dress
she was a model.... :U
00,10you know the whole show was desgined as an advertisment
cosmos is canon
05oo anotehr viking in da hause?!
http://blacksquares.bandcamp.com/track/art-of-the-dress-feat-renard
05awesime
Thats an horrible dress for twlight
05o*
the modeling job really made her uptite when it comes to dresses .-.
No matter if i'm still grounded
IT MUST BE 20% COOLER
Oh yeah
00,10well yeah vause the team that made the show wanted it to be more then just an advertisment
this episode has one of the biggest meme in Bronydom
11,01Jake: No non-image links during stream.
ok
Rarity needs one client at a time
<3
It needs to be about 20% cooler
Cool
^
20% COOLER
it needs to be about 20% cooler
it...needs to be 20% cooler.
Cooler = Wut?
A MEME IS BORN:D
20% cooler :D
20% cooler
11,01No. 21%.
22%!
Twilight's dress is meh.
no 19.5%
and everyone wathes the cam
The percent in thsi room is too damn high!
Yes. They're all paying for the dresses.
well, depending on rounding 20% could be anything from 19.5 to 20.5 %
11,01Of course. Rarity has to make a living.
opal dissapoves
Ugly, but the client is "always" right
I prefer 20.33333 repeating of course.
Twilight's looks like she went to an observetory and everything attactched too her dress
Best survival rate.
RD's ugly dress still looks ok In my opininon.
1% in .5 seconds
twilight cape is nice
lol
Spike needs a dress
XD
or base dress is nice
11,0120 1/3%?
hi all
Fluttershy's vrsion of "nice"
i just don't like how it was used
11,01Xcoder62: Yes.
11,01Give Spike a dress.
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
it doesn't blend well
oshiiii...
Spike needs a tux
Leroy Jenkins. 20.33333 repeating of coure percent cooler.

BEST PONY
Why isn't this episode considered THE BEST one?
cya in 2/26
oh yeah Pinkamena
I forgot
And then she is not seen again untill season 2 finale!
Two seconds of awesome and a legend was born!
She only needed 5 seconds of screen time
me gusta

Ewww!
this one is among my least favourites
fk the dresses
Ick :D
Eggs as a hat? TF2 would be proud
that hat
lol
AJs dress is the worst one\
RD's outfit should be armor in an RPG
Yea, you did
lol
Hoity is such a nice Lagerfeld copy
Rainbow's helmet looks like something in an MMORPG
that kitchen sink
like THE most biggest meme in Bronydom, one of the most popular BG pony in the fandom
lol
sink is best pony

Hahaha :D
All their dresses are very practical though.
Play hard?
11,01Xcoder62: I'm broke, and I didn't post that.

I once did something like this in 3rd grade when I pissed my pants
inb4 Rarity becomes a crazy cat lady
She kind of is
someone stole my name ;A;
Cause it has a plot that won't STOP
actually i agree rarity is my least fav pony
lol
;)
lol
I think rarity is just over dramatic, and does not really subscribe to her own BS.
But that is just me
that whine
One of tabitha's best work
VA having fun.

The problem with pinkie not being very empathic comes, I think, from her having such a dominant personality. She outshines everyone she's near with her energy.

What're you doing T?
13maybe
I missed it
11,01Yay.
FINALLY!
Ghostbusters!
13how's it possible we haven't shown ghostbusters yet....
I voted that for A MONTHS ago
00,03Because no one likes ghosts!
05,15I'm very pleased with this
lol
PLEASE!
01,11Ghosties should hide.
05,15...yay?
00,03Ghosties if you see this, HIDE!
fuck me

Huh. Yugioh movie.

01,11...
FUCKING REALLY?
01,11great.

00,03Its GOOD!
FUCK THAT SHIT
Oh dear oh dear.

05,15So we cool with that?
00,03Because Blue Eyes Whute Dragons are AWESOME!
YUGIOH WAS VOTED?
00,03white*
That...counts.
11,01I'd like to reroll honestly.
00,03NO!
But it's going to suck.
00,03Keep it!
01,11No, it's not. It's a mediocre extended Yu-Ghi-Oh episode.
THATS NOT A MOVIE
DESPITE BEING ONE :/
11,01But we can bring this up to a majority vote.
00,03It was still shown in theatres. Keep
01,11The only reason it qualifies as a "movie" is because it got a threatrical release.
11,02O.O
...
I say reroll in this case
really?
00,03And it's longer than an hour...
11,02They made a YuGiOh movie? D:
nah, we need another WMC :p
Are we forgetting that?
1390 minutes is the low end of movie length
^nope
No
it's an extended YGO episode
no they are not
11,02Then it's alright I would imagine.
00,03Stilll, most movies are about 90 minutes
yeah
11,02Just be prepared for WMC.
but that doesn't mean we have to show them
not supposed to be
I think YGO is gonna blow
In fact I KNOW it blows
which one is it?
bc it's goddamn TGO
ahem YGO
it's Pyramid of Light
13TOUCHDOWN!
now the manga on the other hand
isn't that bad
00,03And it looks like we have a keeper!
bc it's not a marketing scheme
Cool i can't set T because everytime someone writes Don't i would get pinged
And now stream is buffering...
01,11unfortunately, yes.
mine too
01,11And we have buffer as well.
must be Comcast
13we need a +m for +m...
13anyway
/me 13smacks comcast
it's Ghostbusters
i mustve missed it
Stream fails, switch over, and it fails again.
01,11Hey, that seemed to work.
00,03Because Bald Ponies are best ponies
props to whoever picked that
13anyway
Goddammit
13so the mods have been thinking
they say it counts
13we watch lesson zero too much
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-
01,11And what's Pony Episode 2?
/me explodes
inb4 WMC
05,15Finally ezio_auditore with A Friend in Deed
01,11...
01,11no.
oh definitely
01,11no no no fucking no
01,11We watch that damn episode every other f**king week.
13so
ever
bad dubbing? check. Stupid plot and characters? Check. Stupid american edits of walkie talkie's instead of guns or POINTING FUCKING FINGERS? Check. IT's gonna blow harder than Mt. St. Helens.
I wouldn't say ever, just not in more recent times.
YGO is gonna blow
also brb again
05,15could always do the TGOTAS version...
13All 52 episodes are entered into the list, winners are removed
they did
13The list is shuffled and put into a dropdown, to eliminate positioning bias
they did
they also Abridged the other YGO movie
the one with like, a billion dragons
01,11But that's not going to stop people from complaining at us for cheating when a Mod wins anyway.
inb4 you activated my trap card
>.>
05,15Hope you enjoyed Lesson Zero..
More variation!
05,15:(
01,11Alright, and now it's my turn for an announcement.
This may or may not backfire massively. :P
It'll not backfire
05,15oh people are going to be pissed
05,15that's inevitable
Rather a mass then a single person
Oh most definitely.
*email
I can't imagine it's likely to cause that much backlash.
11,01I'm OK with a hiatus. I hope you come back.
05,15EspyLacopa that can be done
which I have issue with
Oh I know. It'll still lead to a backlash. :P
01,11Back home I have Dialup. It sucks and it's all I have available during the times we do BMN.
I loved WoW's latest patch before MoP.
We're toast. Crispy burnt toast.

I'm reminded of that line from the HHGttG.
:p
Another mod going
Dont
Do the lottery results mean that we can't suggest made for TV movies?
13seriously, there was more rage about closing side rooms during the week than there is about eliminating pony episodes for six months
13hub streams would be the exception
:p
13we'll probably tweak the process when the season starts
I'd be leveling now if it weren't for a headache the size of the sun.
If you want to play at the high level, learn to not suck.
It's sort of prohibitive.
some movie about amatuer film directors or someting
Oh, incidentally.
it's like a documentary
I'm at 89 now and just starting on the Dread Wastes
Wait
/me smacks TrixieLiesHardCore.
is it marble hornets?
:P
I hope not
Thanks, I was wondering about that
I have the file still
me
Imight be able to email it to you
"kirzwubssilver" would be an outright lie :P
05,15JESmith71 that's just an example, several episodes are overplayed
13seems we always get those
Every other week.
05,15Dester I found it humurous.
and then everypony requested Winter Wrap up
05,15So did the American Film Institute
it's mall
nyope :3
...
aww
Lol, dat intermission
Canon.
yep
he din't say anything
I still wish we would always get the list of rejected votes after every lottery...
05,15PONY I'm doing that as we speak
That'd be a first.
By comparison, the recent anniversary movie is WAY WAY worse
Implying that facade holds together.
:P
Is another movie gonna play after 4 minutes?
You're about as cohesive looking as the middle east.
Just say 'no comment' next time. :P
In that it basically exists to shit all over the show's canon :P
#TwilightSparkle
ALL of the show canon.
Yes PONY
pony its crap
Neat.
know you know
It's not, that's the thing. >_>
The more you know.
now**
ugh

01,11The only time I enjoyed Pyramid of Light was when my high school friends (who were all girls) muted the movie and dubbed over it to make every male character gay for each other. It was hilarious.
C418
Oy.
I'm back now. :P
11,01Silverscreen: XD
and I've been at work most evenings lately, during the week I'm only online 1-3 hours
Stream YuGiOh BBT abridged!
Fascinatingly? The manga it's based on is actually really good (and absurdly dark)
Which means you're online during the same time as I am, mostly.
Remember, you're a fair few timezones away from me. :P
PONY NO its way way bad
Because the side rooms are still +i.
atm, there is an intermission

Woah it buffered on 0:42 for me
Still want to se The Room by wiseau
It's the sign:O
I still say that Spiders web was worse than Babes in Toyland
I always read dat "Shifuka"
sweet,perfect timing :D
And despite a lot of people saying it should have been WMC'd, I don't think it actually was.
I don't think my tf2 is even close to being updated
probably less than 1GB on updates
0,5Herro
01,11This movie is just strange. No idea how else to describe it. Just watch.
Hide everyone!
Oooh... I haven't seen Survival Style 5+ for a long time, should probably start voting for it.
13worst
13lemonade stand
13ever
well goodbye everypony
0,5>.>
what's the name of this movie?
^3^ /)?
That Beattles movie with the blue meanie isn't on the worse movie clause, right?
0,5Heeey wait a second
see yall later
....
It IS marked as watchable again
Yellow Submarine? How could anyone WMC that?
11,01At least I don't need to worry about it destroying my house.
That movie was WMC'd.
11,01Or my grandmother's house.
one does not simply leave coffee be if it is bad
Why would that be WMC'd? Yellow Submarine was great.
it's awesome
...And why isn't "Spider's Web: A Pig's Tale" on the WMC'd?
Yellow Submarine is Great*
was played before the WMC
11,01Bronysith: Are you wanting me to clean the tornado?
13EspyLacopa: as i said earlier in the year when being questioned about it... no idea why my records said it was WMC, but it wasn't
13it's been corrected since march
01,11The Last Airbender was shown before WMC was instigated.
Oh
11,01OK.
That explains everything
11,01Thought Last Airbender was shown after WMC was created.
13dat retitle
I think originally it was WMC'd but then it was changed later.
01,11The WMC was made for Babes in Toyland.
It came literally the week after Babes.
>_>
05,15Shizuka those are two different posts I think
Look at the calendar.
Buried was a great movie
01,11Which, ironically, is a movie I like.
13that they are
And I *know* that the mods WMC'd it.
I thought this movie was in color?
I recognise that face anywhere.
not even the face,just the eyes are enough
13CUE THE SUN
Wasn't there an MST3K for Babes in Toyland?
lol
13suddenly color
And... COLOR
budget rises...
13whyyyyyy
Because it's just too obscure?
13how is the truman show obscure
Sorry to sound bitchy about it, but honestly you're overhamming how bad it is.
"The what?"
13sigh..
luck*
13ponies have no culture..
are we streaming the second movie?
0,5DAMN IT U GUISE
0,5HOW CAN U NOT KNO
or did it end
0,5GOODNETH
truman show is obscure because it came out a long, long, long time ago
13so the rest of the movie is them trying to get this scene?
Or perhaps it's because it came out in 1998.
01,11Looking into it myself, I have to agree on TLA.
When I would have been...6.
13no really is the rest of the movie them trying to get this take?
05,15Just in case any of you missed it, here's a link to the list of entries, hopefully this helps you guys out https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlUTJdk0fIaNdDlEaVRTRWNmcXZwejhycnNaZFhoUkE
i takre that back, it would make the movie barable
05,15Shizuka nah.
05,15they move on...eventually
Argh
I'm 25.
truman show was never popular or aired enough in mexico that's my story and i'm sticking to it
this download thing won't let me close
I'm 19.
Bonus points if grandma's next line involves how she has breast cancer
there we go
At least from US mainstream TV.
13why don't you put the boom on a stick
Oh, it's a film.
waaait, kung fu hustle isnt A.
05,15There was a Truman Show reference...and I missed it!?
05,15NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Yeah, then I'm definitely out.
13never understood why the whole boom thing is a problem.. take muscle fatigue out of the equation
"May I make a suggestion?"
"Run."
01,11Brony_From_Kent: 1995
wait
They should just do the scene and then a voiceover in post.
or did we already switch to the 7.5 system for movie voting
I've been alternating The Matrix and The Thing in my A movie slot.
oh look
11,01I haven't seen him in anything in a long time.
I was 14
LOL
Pfft.
Is everybody hurt?
Why did she ask that?
This scene is CURSED.
01,11And that's why all open-faced lights have a wire frame around the bulb.
Murphy's Law is stron in this one.

No, not this one.

05,15Meanwhile The Matrix was shown too recently
Her line is"Ellen, I have no memory of this whatsoever."

That had the best line there

then how is kung fu hustle A movie
01,11...
it had a 20 mil budget
01,11*slaps* No. YOu do it as told.
05,15Besides, we use Rotten Tomatoes
You egocentric bastard
i thought dari said imdb
xD
I've had a couple up as well :p
Does the budget still have to be in dollars to qualify as A?
kung fu hustle is a cult movie though
This movie had a shoestring budget, just $500,000
xD
01,11Randomnerd, with that description, I can't help but think you look like Monroe from Grimm.
yep
:p
05,15It made a lot of money, and it has a really high critical reception
I always look at the drawfriend when i see the post :P
13that was well played

Bam!
I swear you guys were using IMDB for ratings for quite a while.
01,11Randomnerd: If his girlfriend is any indication, then yes.
This'd be nice if he was actually trying to be friendly.
01,11*slap* NO!
Fuuuuuuu
13only time drops don't count is when there's a special crate floating around or the pyromania stufff
Special crate floating around?
05,15twilight_sprinkle it's a combination of gross, budget, and reception

If we count Spike, shouldn't we count the other pets? :p

That's...
13falcon should have been the winner
the cutest shot
of Rianbow Dash
13this episode is bs
thank goodness you;re not hurt rainbow. RD: are you f***ing kidding me
Falcon, etc. abandoned RD, Tutoise didn't
11,01Not hurt, but she's wearing a brace anyway.
13cause the falcon won every other challenge
Now I feel bad for the falcon
13the tortoise failed every event and had to cheat to cross the line
13see
01,11Shizuka's kinda right. Espeically seeing that Tank shouldn't have even been competing.
13and totally dumps the falcon
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAY?
