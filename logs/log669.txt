Well, I guess Hasbro is going to have to delay the full series DVD release of FiM to fix their animation glitches just like Shaft always does.

My first reaction to that voice: HOLY CRAP, 4KIDS GOT TO HASBRO?! :O

i had*
when she said doc
GTFO walk home to your house in the clouds
her wings are broken so how can she fly home
the hospital had to cut funds
00,10stay off your wing, good luck geting home
^ :D
I always wondered this part. She can't fly, lives in a cloud home, and is kicked out of the hospital.
lol
RD forgot her insurance card lol
she could stay with fluttershy
Well I'm off to sleep, goodnight everyone. :P
Uh, she could just take the balloon up there
Info_Searcher the hospital is out of money
DO YOU WANNA PLAY A GAME?
Well said Kid :)

for powerpuff girls fans (or tara strong/lauren faust/craig mccracken fans): http://derpy.me/QBBgM
why isn't season 3 out yet?
then they deleted the server
cause its a half season
Considering the fact that the Kanzius treatment is right around the corner, I think it would be better to refer to this as Chemo Dash instead of Cancer Dash.
Are those what the actual new beyblades look like? :S
:O It's like they know adults watch ponies too
pony_2304: cause you touch yourself at night
AJIsAwesome I'm afraid so :(
*sigh*
Bronysith: DOn't be like that. :D
The loss of hair is something that only happens as a result of chemotherapy, not cancer itself.
lol i see what yyou did there
AJIsAwesome Do you know yugioh?

I heard new epsiodes start october 10
Sumica: week

Kandarihu: Yeah, but I was in a rush to name the file to get up to show. Plus I was going by the cancer comments in the chat box
AJIsAwesome Oh god not 3rd gen :S
J_E_Smith71, I see.
00,10hmmmmm 6 eps

00,10new ad for dash and Twi so far
You guys ever go pick apples, I did once and my family is going to pick some again
i did when i was a kid

Well, we'll soon be thinking "You remember back when cancer patients were bombarded by tons of radiation?
Inflamation of the Lazy?
season 3 is like cake ....A LIE
AlienWarhead, should be
Sumica: And now that you mention it each of the eps does feature one of the Mane 6

Jake: that's that with fandom given names...
Jake: different ponies
GO BACK TO WORK DRAGON
Screwball And Screwloose have different cutie marks and colors

And once aghain Spike's self asteem gets another crushing blow
Screwball is the flying earth pony in the discord episode.
Seriously Twilight, you're a shitty parent
Spike has all my feels
that mean your going to try cuting yourself?
>tfw
because that doesn't seem like a good idea
StinkomanFan i thought twilight was like an older sister
dr evil much lol
StinkomanFan: Well, of course. She not old enough to know the responsibilities of being a parent.
That Aipom tail
Why do old tempels always have execution chambers that work super slow
00,10kinda like DD's voice
StinkomanFan: Plus, she's more of a caretaker/guardian rather than a parent.
AJIsAwesome, except she's already a young adult by pony standards.
look at that leg wiggle

Why give her wings if she doesnt even use them?
pfsd
D'AWWWW

And then it got worse.
post flight stress disorder
DerpyMuffins you're right, she was a earth pony in the concepts
00,10way to go after your friend
Sumica: applejack is more loyal than rainbow dash
/me now where is that ManUp.jpg
She was supposed to be an Earth Pony named Posy.
I gotta admit it, this brought a tear to my eye the first time
Dat NUT!
Sumica: Dash needed to make sure the Training went well. All of Equestria counts on them.
No, ping. NOT YAY. :|
00,10that's why she is the element of Loy(honisty)
And now: ducks
shes like doctor doodidle
finally back with breakfast
Fluttershy is just too weak
If AJ could fly she would have the most wingpower
Fluttershy can throw her yays
incoming great montage
Sumica: do i even have to bring up the end of season 2 again?
We're gonna need a montage
YOU JUST GOTTA BELIEVE.

I.......have..........returned
better music than every other montage of sound
Girl we need a montage
also, creepy derpy mask... i want it!
I think they switched AJ and Fluttershy
Honestly I am glad that the characters in this show are not black and white, just gona represent my element 24/7. There is a lot of gray area in every thing, so by extention ponies should be that way too.
Man, this montage
/me We're back to the 80's montage........now the action can begin
You're the best! AROUND! Nothings gonna ever get you donw...

why NewSuperBronyU|Zzz afk? ;A;

8 I Think
twilight doesnt even recognize spike as a friend, he is a FRIGGIN SLAVE
Look at me, Im bottling air
The only reason why Fluttershy had 0.5WP the first time is because she chickened out right before she crossed the Amamometer
Dat Smell
/me hugs Lyra`

Hey guys, coming up here when Dash asks "Are we ready to do this?" and it goes to the shot of Twilight and Spitfire afterwards look closely at the purple and blond pony in the crowd's eyes. She pulls a Derpy
sometimes it was watermellon

how are things Dark92Enigma
you'll see d3rb_ you'll see
d3rb_ more mad at the fact she isn't helping
Im gonna calll my cat rumble or blossom
Did anybody else notice that?
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/8019/
i've seen this, spitfire is a judge, not a participant
Averaging 40 wingpower I'd say.
spike is such a waffle ass
spitfire could have helped, but didnt
Which is high.
00,10holding a sundial to your ear to listen for ticking eh spitfire?
Bronysith: why must you do this to me
makes sense :3
Sumica: They do tick.
Spitfire is not a clever pony SUmica
Spitfire's had a long night man, give her a break
just look at the measures. the average wp is about 9
maybe spitfire is hungover asnd cbf
cant you see that sex mane? shes hung over and hung out.
*sexy.
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/7772/
Wait.
well spitfire and gilda are the same person, so maybe some gilda came out
worthless raindrops
now the question is how did they trasnfer that sickness :S
it explains the dark goggles
00,1080 pagasai were tragacily mamed today
I found this interesting. The water tornado breaks and sends ponies in all directions. Derpy is the only one still flying.
8 pegasi have the pegi-flu LO
now why didnt :'( fake having the feather flu?
:O
Dat Splash :3
If they're only missing 8 pegasi, how is that too few to lift the water, considering they were going for 1000 and each pegasi is 10?
that white pony with goggles in the water looks familiar... http://derpiboo.ru/10422
Math fail? O.o
YEAH
yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Sumica: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/7553/
One pony drowned tragically
great scott
so, for her to go down. you have to be flying?
CK|Ded: Yeah. By those numbers, those pegasi were worth 40 wp a piece.
Spectrum_Rush: you're right, he looks a little brown
It's just a cartoon, though.

And then Fluttershy was in the Wonderbolts
spitfyre, rainbow, just buck already! the sexual tensiion is killing me.
Oh, that timing was exxxcellent
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES
AJ can run faster than Fluttershy can fly

Squallken: You missed a couple of episodes. though.
All inventions help make you lazy
I missed it
Wait, they like to "snog"?
Magic Tap - for when you get too lazy to pick up the container to pour into a glass
That's kind of dirty
AJIsAwesome They only serve to make themselfs more lazy with alot of the stuff they end up inventing
I just looked up MLP on Party City and all there stuff is G3. They only have like two FiM items
I can imagine parents of VERY young children preferring that thing over kids carrying jugs that are too heavy for them.
And that is care bears trying to hard to get a fan base it will never have in its current state.
appajack!

DerpyMuffins: Only rarity has glue, she's a rebel
Glue made from tree sap?
AJIsAwesome: I'll give her that, hehe. She's quite the mare to figure out
GIRLS ON FILM

"who wants to play a game with me" NOOOO!
Best rarity episode here
I bet they make the glue from ponies sent to the dungeon in Canterlot
not sure what square is doing with the XIII franchise
PARTY :O CITY
still no pinkie pie
bad luck Bronysith. i would ask for a ff13
I don't think square knows what they're doing with the FF franchise any more
any pony know if they have any pony custumes at partuy city
not even paying attention to new FFs
Eli: it is just so awful as a movie, not even a game
Wait, Angry Birds Costume? :S
The green maned pony on the left, what is her name?
club penguin!!!
her name is Sumica
I thought about getting a slender costume
Sumica. K Thanks
A gibble sandwich
Bronysith: lot's of room for improvement?
or Sumi
Lol, kirzstryfe :D
Eli: they are going to milk the fuck out of a shit game
im so lucky i perorered a wii u
I hate naps, too kids. :D
._.
Omg i know can find all of you on care.com
Bronysith: we'll see when it's out...
Looks like that site could double as a dating site.
I never liked naps. :D
luna is best
Keep trying, Hub.
ok shut up
yes!
Eli: heres FF13-3 in a nutshell, push forward, press X or a, win game
AW SHIT
I'll still never watch your shameless attempt to make lightning strike twice.
My favorite episode
>_>
Fail whispering
FFIV fas best FF
dat plot
Or FF7
Bronysith was that the same with XIII-2?
Twlight's bag is on
Dken2021: yup
Only FF game I beat was FFVI
don't start the bag thing,lol
NEW OUTFIT GUISE
FF10 was ok
PonyStationVita right you are /)
FFIV was pretty good, but FFVI was the best i'd say.
o-o
http://imgur.com/a/Rmt4Y I WANT THIS TATOO
Bronysith: yeah, sure... have you played ff13 1 or 2?
Info_Searcher: /)
I liked FF10
Eli: yup, all you do is press a the whole time
Bronysith, dude that's awesome
You can talk never for an answer
Where do ponies go to get glasses?
AlienWarhead: it has an amazing story
shame you cannot read my post
FF10 was such a good game
CrimsonPhoenix: what u mean?
Nah
NahQ!
Chrysalis: i loved the story so much
X-II was not so great
Atire?
going naked lol ponies rule dude
What? You can read me?
ps vita remake was good
but still OK
Just don't touch the hat.
Works duds=nothing
Dat RD
Damn, Rainbow welcome
What if Twilight is still blind in one eye from the telescope incident
WAT
Bronysith: well, then you didn't play it right. i don't care, i liked it
I wonder if RD pays for all the damage
^
Nope
I'll make love to Rainbow Dash! I'll make love to you, and you, and all of you!
Does RD pay for anything?
Twlight will fix the damage
RD is a government worker, so it's covered by Celestia
I thik CrimsonPhoenix just squeeled with "IDEAAAAAA"
with her magic
Lol
RD's bucket hat is the best
XylemTube, I'll sing instead
i think the worst FF i played was on the ipad FF Dimensions
MATHEMATICS
00,10SONG!
<3 Rarity songs
SING ALONGGG GUISE
YES
Its going to be hard
go song
SONG!
Awesome song
fancy mathematics
Best S1 Song
<3
Rarity too OP. :P
Song
Ear worm
THREAD BY THREAD
o-o
Oh Applejack, you make her hard.
i like twilights dress best of all
Poor cat
InB4 Vinyl Scratch
being unique,isn't that wat everypony is meant to be?
AFTER MORE WORK........i'm back again
00,10the song just makes me sad now.
isn't her dress blue?
i agree 2
Sumica: why is that?
XylemTube, aka best pony
Sumica: Why? D:
why Sumica?
00,10I still cant figure out the captions on youtube
Six of us and Lickety-Split? Lickety-Split's not in this Gen, AJ
Instant first thought on this: needs remix
Bronysith: I like RD's more
Sad? Why sad?
Why does'nt applejack have her own song?
/me sings along
it makes me sad 2 idk why
00,10one guy I asked said it just happend on it's own
Everypony has had their own song but AJ
realizing theres 6 episodes, 1 for each pony
00,10he did't do any thing to ad them
You could just simply die
Rainbow Dash is a tank now canon
nice!
I never acutally learned these lyrics (tries)
DerpyMuffins: everypony will get their own song way before applejack actually gets one
Rainbow won't look like a tortoise~
Bronysith: I just wanted to put my own 2 cents in.
Dog and Pony show would've been better
ART OF THE DREEEEESSSSSSS
I like all the dresses, but i like Twilight's the most
for a Rarity episode
Awesome song
In before 20% cooler.
gasp
ART OF THE DRESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Everypony does not like their dress
insert art of the dress by cats millionair here
SWANK
I never got why they didn't like the dresses
Twilight's dress <3
I would love a friend who makes me clothes for me :P
oh god, tiwlights dress <3
we didn't get a pinke ep yet, did we
Wirisme, this basically explains Rarity
They're nuts. Those dresses are awesome. >_:>
*>_>
00,10I lost the link Spectrum_Rush
i don't see their problem... the dresses are great ;)
pretty sure Daniel Ingram has said that AJ doesn't have a song because he hasn't been able to find one that works for her and fits into the story
I don't understand why they don't like them
http://i.imgur.com/DdEtt.jpg I NEED IT
yay
Rainbow Dash's dress<3
I heard yay
Ponies not impressed, UNGRATEFUL!
Her motivation, her element, her passion
inb4 critiques
Fluttershy's dress screams: YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE ME
/me knocks them on the head
this episode explains it all
AND
It's....nice.
00,10blunt as always dash
Nitpicky lot aren't they. >.>
Nice
PLUM GRATEFUL
It's THE episode for all artist alike
Dark92Enigma: COME OUT
Maybe they should try them on first
NOT APPLE GRATEFUL
RD is just outright mean
Art, music, any form of media
and then i few more episodes later they ruined them at the gala
Rarity should make every Bronystate mod a dress.
RD is just saying what is on her mind
this is THE episode about creativity
Blunt is painful, but I'd rather have blunt honesty over an elegant lie any day.
not 120%
Nittany_Discord: Yes!
which is why I ABSOLUTELY Love this one
and why are you naked?
00,10hey boys it's afKirz
XylemTube: come out of what?

11,01A little much Bronysith.
AJIsAwesome has it already been played?because I may have missed it
Rarity vs. old navy
pick the CM
pony_5791: Yep.
So much advertising...
00,10J_E_Smith71 nah we showed MLP tales last time
AJIsAwesome ah 6_9
Sumica: :D
Say I if you would pay this
J_E_Smith71, from the time I joined Bronystate until April Fool's Day, I had not seen ANYTHING of Pre-G4 MLP, much less on Bronystate
Why
augmented real;ity i think ill stick with 3ds or ps vita
Wait**
OMG OMG OMG OMG OMGOM FUND IT FUND IT FUND IT http://i.imgur.com/GHv9p.jpg
yay
i wish i was augmented
Nittany_Discord: but by celestias mane you look fabulous
goldd
Why isn't Rainbow's episode Sonic Rainboom?
00,10whys it got to be whites metal dectector?
00,10dat racist
ikr
Sumica: I was talking about in the future
Bronysith: ALL MY MONEY.
Bronysith but banjo kazooie wasnt that fun
I'm determined to watch THE DARK KNIGHT no matter what...........and YOU CAN'T STOP ME, MOM!
Bronysith, but Rare is shit noe
now***
i heard a ping and didnt get one
11,01I do?
I keep hearing "yay" ._.
Nyst as far as im aware, all channels are that bad
i want to take ur job
is it strange that peppy ponies causes me to draw dark things? :U
yaya
you basically pay for 40mins of show and 20mins of advertising
Well, the ads on children's television are pretty much geared towards children... or parents
I like the way things are here, with just one ad break per show
00,10clearly you are crazy and have pony on the brain pony_5791
more if longer
I....love it
generally a break every 15 minutes or so
ur gonna love me!:[
i do like the BBC for that
@Sumica probably :D
no adverts mid-show
inb4 massive critique wave
http://imgur.com/a/yrQ4I#3
Actually, each episode being 22 mins long means 8 mins of ads
tellmetellmetellmetellmetellmetellme
*Deep Breath* Speech time!
aaaaaand go fluttershy
Her element is kindness,not honesty
Apply ice to burn
element of sewing
in german tv that means only one break
Wut?

ow
Vikingstill its still around 1/3 of the time watching a show is actually just advers
fluttercritic, is best part of this episode
Orion is canon
take 2 for rarity
Chysalis true
Even tho Rarity is my fav pony, I dont really like FS's dress
she was a model.... :U
00,10you know the whole show was desgined as an advertisment
This NEEDS to be used for the results section of a ponified Rhythm Heaven sketch
cosmos is canon
05oo anotehr viking in da hause?!
http://blacksquares.bandcamp.com/track/art-of-the-dress-feat-renard
05awesime
Thats an horrible dress for twlight
Sumica: yep
05o*
the modeling job really made her uptite when it comes to dresses .-.
No matter if i'm still grounded
Wrek: you must establish dominance
Sumica: at least it's done better than pokemon
IT MUST BE 20% COOLER
Oh yeah
Jake enough with the relinking already
00,10well yeah vause the team that made the show wanted it to be more then just an advertisment
this episode has one of the biggest meme in Bronydom
11,01Jake: No non-image links during stream.
ok
I love RD's dress tho
so yeah this episode is pretty much one of the best
Sumica: The show is what is making the product now
Rarity needs one client at a time
<3
i like RD's dress because it covers so much of her
It needs to be about 20% cooler
Cool
^
20% COOLER
it needs to be about 20% cooler
it...needs to be 20% cooler.
Cooler = Wut?
it needs to be about 20% cooler and thus begins a new era of percentages
A MEME IS BORN:D
20% cooler :D
Sumica: without it, sales would drop. Same if the quality were to drop
20% cooler
11,01No. 21%.
22%!
Twilight's dress is meh.
and thus bronies kept on repeating that single quote
no 19.5%
and everyone wathes the cam
What budget?
The percent in thsi room is too damn high!
Yes. They're all paying for the dresses.
and thats the art if the DDRESSSSSSS
well, depending on rounding 20% could be anything from 19.5 to 20.5 %
11,01Of course. Rarity has to make a living.
opal dissapoves
Ugly, but the client is "always" right
I prefer 20.33333 repeating of course.
Twilight's looks like she went to an observetory and everything attactched too her dress
Best survival rate.
RD's ugly dress still looks ok In my opininon.
1% in .5 seconds
twilight cape is nice
lol
Spike needs a dress
XD
or base dress is nice
11,0120 1/3%?
hi all
Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH, I'd prefer 20.33333333333333333333333333333333333 but NOT repeating
Fluttershy's vrsion of "nice"
XylemTube: except the helmet
what is this?
i just don't like how it was used
XylemTube, it's exactly as hoity toity said
11,01Give Spike a dress.
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
it doesn't blend well
oshiiii...
Spike needs a tux
Leroy Jenkins. 20.33333 repeating of coure percent cooler.
that eye twitch
Holla everypony! :)
he actaully had tuxedi at the gala
SPike means "get ready for all your dreams to be put down"
hi GilDash
hoity toity,y designer names sound so silly
you mean nightmares. :U
lol
Hi GilDsh
derp
O.o he sat on his noise
flankplant.
6.6 x Pi %
Oh Spike, you're never gonna get any from Rarity because of this
Doctor Hooves :D
LETS PLay SOME WUBS
Vinyl :)

DJ P0N3
Vinyl scratch is born
Pon3 ^_^
vinyl scratch
sumi message about audio transcribe sent to ya
VINNYYLLLL
BEST PONY
DAT VINYL
Why isn't this episode considered THE BEST one?
cya in 2/26
swag spike
Needs Octavia as well
oh yeah Pinkamena
I forgot
And then she is not seen again untill season 2 finale!
Vinyl needs a voice.
i have a shirt for vinyl
Two seconds of awesome and a legend was born!
She only needed 5 seconds of screen time
me gusta
on air for 5 seconds, become on of the most popular background poinies
CrimsonPhoenix because different people look for different things in a show
Ewww!
CrimsonPhoenix: becuase we're not all rabid Rarity fans
You do realize that Octavia lives in Canterlot, right?
this one is among my least favourites
fk the dresses
Ick :D
Eggs as a hat? TF2 would be proud
Octavia and Scratch have never met in canon, have they?
that hat
d3rb: Same with Derpy
lol
Or was Octavia at the wedding party?
cloud kicker dissaproves
XylemTube, it's not only rarity, it's how this one episode made alot of stuff in the fandom
XylemTube: speak for your self <3 rarity
Fluttershy,I believe there's a bird nest on your head.
AJs dress is the worst one\
RD's outfit should be armor in an RPG
Yea, you did
Nyst, Octavia was at the reception.
lol
J_E_Smith71, derpy was in eps way more than vinyl
Hoity is such a nice Lagerfeld copy
Rainbow's helmet looks like something in an MMORPG
that kitchen sink
lyra agrees
like THE most biggest meme in Bronydom, one of the most popular BG pony in the fandom
lol
sink is best pony
11,01http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_max8raiLPZ1qf7o6e.png
Noone
and dont forget colgate
fuck off spike
Kandarihu: ooh, that means there's a good chance they met! canon met!
But where was Octavia over the wedding
rd's helmet can resist to the death star
d3rb: I was talking her about Derpy being in the background real quick and then becoming popular in the fandom
11,01Related.
Nittany_Discord true story
I see RD got her Tier 1 epics from that dungeon she has been raiding the last month.
awkward silence
Nittany_Discord: Roflmao!!! Wuuut
nooooooooooooooo
ahh right gotcha :)
Discord :p buy a dress
Hahaha :D
oh my god
All their dresses are very practical though.
11,01That was on the Offensive Ponies blog.
Play hard?
Twilight could teach an astronomy class without a map
NEVER!
"WHO WANTS TO PLAY A GAME WITH ME?" Jigsaw does
that kid
Nittany_Discord, lolwat
best kid
uhhh
I wanna take your job
Applejack could quickly go plow the field without taking her dress off.
Hooo sheeeiit!
...
guise, you laugh you lose. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EReqdqRAyQc&feature=relmfu
I need that
SMASH ALL THE THINGS!
discord, Take that guy's job, before the kid does.
lol

Vikingstill, you post videos you're banned
And Fluttershy could breed a bird's egg while doing something else.
Vikingstill: NO. You broke the RUELS!!
oops
LOL
didnt know
"OH YEAH!"
hence why i dont sell to gamestop ever again :)
Vikingstill: not very original anymore...
11,01I have posted to Offensive Ponies before. Have fun finding the one that mod posted.
pokemon black and white 2
lol
I miss the times when we'd only be complaining about the ads for bad products/services... like Gamefly
05CrimsonPhoenix: its not "post video and you are banned"
...
05jeez
Oh god.
05stop backseat modding

05posting non image links during streams isnt allowed
11,01But if you look at notes...
/me noms on Wrek
LETS PARTEH WITH EASY BAKE

05Vehicles should no longer be spawning under the world.
05Your in game map should load a little more quickly.
05Galaxy spawns are being temporarily disabled. They'll return we promise.
05Spotted vehicles and players should no longer persist after death on the minimap.
05We thought you'd like the Drifter Jumpjets but apparently you want to take them off. You can now.
05All the lingering vehicle debris should be lingering less.
05An issue with Outfit names displaying incorrectly over players heads has been resolved.
Dark92Enigma, it's a lazy way to do it
His parents must have hated him to call him Cranky.

Well its cooler than Winky Dink where they sent you a plastic sheet to put over the TV and you used crayons to make it look like you draw stuff in the show
LunasGuard: the SMILE song? yes.
Same voice for Cranky does Captain Ginyu ^^

Pinkie is the queen of songs
rdibp: it's not MY BIRTHDAY!!!!!!!!!
The problem with pinkie not being very empathic comes, I think, from her having such a dominant personality. She outshines everyone she's near with her energy.

Lil:B the advertisments are crap though
AJIsAwesome: and finally, you must tell someone you trust, like a your parents, a teacher, a police officer (cue AoStH theme)
they could announce the air date next week, to start in 2014

Harvey is badass
Just poppin in a little bit while I'm at my parent's
wait, no we didnt
13jim gordon freeman
01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Early in the film, a witness on stand pulls a gun out on Harvey Dent (Two-Face) during the trial and tries to shoot him. This is a nod towards Two-Face's original origin story in the comics where in a similar trial scenario, crime boss Sal Maroni is on stand and throws sulfuric acid in Dent's face resulting in his scarring.
okay Brits, time record Doctor Who, and release it to the world within an hour
I'm just waiting for the movie lottery to happen. I remembered to enter this week.
Ok guise, I'm ba-OOOH the Dark Knight! <3

BatBunny_Striker: The team I cheered for lost 13-7
Bye bye

I got to see the dark knight rises though.

http://i.imgur.com/IFkfxl.jpg DAFUQ
Exactly. Also, dat reference.
IT BEGINS
Shizuka, there might be ways to smuggle it in.
gotden freeman!?! :O
Silverscreen: if i'm not wrong, that was also referenced in the first 2 films, before Batman Forever
Bronysith: That actually is true. More people were watcing honey boo boo than the republican national convention.
Shizuka depends how much Acid you weant and how hicgh the concentration is

Silverscreen: people seem to care about you,

Silverscreen you forgot to turn off your swag
Lil_B: the hell is honey boo boo?
Brad[Laptop]: I can't watch that show, and I felt like when I tried to watch Jersey Shore; I lost brain cells.
01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Whilst filming in Chicago, Wanted was the neighboring production, and Morgan Freeman worked concurrently on both films. At one point, Wanted comic book writer Mark Millar visited the set but without permission. The security and Lauren Shuler Donner (who also visited the set at that time) caught Millar sitting on the Batpod. Millar was escorted away from the set.

seems legit
y so serios
Million dollar joker
Shizuka: i wish Gorilla Moonsoon was here
The Joker - As played by Bill Cosby
Apokalipse: Wait till intermission, you'll get the story
Joker used the Dead Ringer. Shizuka!
01,11Alfred is the only guy that can tell a sexy russian chick he won't touch her and STILL appear to be a cool straight man.
/me My father was… a drinker. And a fiend. And one night he goes off crazier than usual. Mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself. Oh, he doesn't like that. Not. One. Bit.
Bronysith: that is one hell of a good Decal/painting
Alright
here we go
hi
13is thish a long shtory?
hey
ah
Shizuka he spends day telling him the story
gonna go
/me why SO SERIOUS!!?????
lol, Shizuka
WHY SO SERIOUS!!!???

I think the Joker should CUT it short
WHY SO SERIOUS
I almost wish some one would throw Jokers BS right back into his face
hey
lets put a smile on dat face
Nope
"Let's put a smile on that face!"
Aaaaaaaaand....
Why so serious?
Let's put a smile on that FAEC~
I dont want to smile anymore
why so SERIOUS!??????????
hello everypony how are y'all
Why so serious?

...Did he snap his neck?
JOKER GASM!
Hello PeachStreak, Im fine
how goes?
Oh shit Joker, that was the healing gun.
11,01That shouldn't have killed him.
01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The Joker only looks at three of the people he kills in the film.
TRYOUTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
aw man he's super ded
You onlyu made him stronger!
Make it quick
That Joker origin here is so cringe inducing
Hm. I dunno how they are going to play pool with a song broken stick
J_E_Smith71, I agree
But whatever.
J_E_Smith71, there's no Joker origin in this movie
dats one helluva recruitment drive
Deadlypon3: he pointed a gun on his mouth
mr fox
J_E_Smith71: And it changes throughout the movie.
I guess Joker likes to have those who think outside da box
Nittany_discord I think he slammed the knife into his mouth and through the brain
two weeks
/me So, me watching, he takes the knife to her— laughing while he does it— turns to me and says, "Why so serious?" Comes at me with the knife— "Why so serious?!?" Sticks the blade in my mouth— "Let's put a smile on that face!"
Joker likes to invent his own origin story
CrimsonPhoenix: I don't mean origin I just meant the how he got the scars
J_E_Smith71: The best part is that he keeps changing the story.
J_E_Smith71, again he tells a different story all the time
Dark92Enigma: i cri evry tim

shiiitt...Can you believe the last airbender is 7 years old?!
:O

O.O
Kawaii_icybeauti: :3 and its legacy lives on
Even in BATMAN TAS, we never know if it's true, or it's in the Joker's mind
MadSurge: That was one of my favorite shows as a child.
Kawaii_icybeauti: 7 YEARS!?
that guard has a chin like iron
two weeks
Dark92Enigma: Eyup. Can you beliece it?
Those fake camera clack noises
Kawaii_icybeauti: we're getting old right?
13yeah cause a phone stuck inside a glass box would be able to detect anything outside that box
dem*
Not sonar like a bat?
good luck
Kawaii_icybeauti: I was too old to be a child, finally watched it this year :D
Silverscreen: if i'm not wrong, In BATMAN TAS, Joker said a similar story to Harley Quinn, am i wrong?
Check out that shiiiiitttt
im batman
Shizuka: It's a Batman thing. He's about as concerned with real world physics as Pinkie Pie.
Eli: I feel old too. I still remember when gamboys only had 1 screen and phones lacked internet access.
Batman can't fly
rdibp, nope.
:'(
pretty good, you?
13you could pick up the vibrations on the hull but the phone doesn't have that luxury
01,11Dark92Enigma: Correct. He gave several conflicting stories and kept turning the tide to mess with her head.
He can glide
MLG aim
Shizuka: Sound penetrates glass, as I recall, which is what sonar relies upon. :p
13well yes it would
I'm fine
13but the reflection would be weak wouldn't it
Friendly EMP detonated.
IT'S all about mind games.......
for a guy who abhorrs guns, he's got a good aim
Kawaii_icybeauti: i feel old too... strange tho, i'm only 19... since today. that's gonna take some time to get used to :)
Would you really trust the words of the JOKER about what his origin story?
alright be back in time when the movie is over
Back in the day....
13the glass box should at least distort the picture the sonar gets back
Joker, in case you didn't realize it, is INSANE
Kawaii_icybeauti: I remember how Gameboys only had 2-3 Colors. Green, Black and the occasional Grey.
Silverscreen: the Joker has no origin story in this movie :D
and he works better without one
even in the comics
Eli: Happy birthday then. Join the 19 club :)
Suprise Mothaf***a!
Shizuka: you don't like this movie, don't you :D
rdibp ok, you don't know what you're missing
Joker has NO origin, he just appeard
how was he suddenbly obeve the roof of the building he was jumping from?
rape time
I think it's a running gag that every time someone asks him, Joker comes up with a new backstory.
13hm guess so
01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: During the Hong Kong action scene (to bring Lau back), Batman shoots time-bombs on the glass which has a time of 2:22 minutes. The bombs explode almost exactly after 2 minutes 20 seconds in real time, which shows that the action could happen in almost 2 minutes.
/me joins the 19 club
REAL-TIME-BOMBS? wow
Now could it be distorted? Yeah possibly, a bit. But not significantly enough that it'd ruin the mapping, not at that short of a range I'd think. Maybe an inch or so off.
That's a rarity in movies.
Shizuka: you sound like me when I'm watching something I don't like :D
13just thinking it should be getting more reflections from the box than from beyond the box
01,11I like how he's just like "woah, guess he's gone..."
'tis possible, yeah.
lol
Shizuka: what about......OUTSIDE THE BOX?
oh and thx Iwa
13at least the sky hook thing really was a program in the 60s :3
11,01Might want to use more than one phone to get a more accurate position reading.
how did they not catch the craft enteringf anmd existing there air space and NOT IT
STOP IT*
01,11Dark92Enigma: What about INSIDE THE CHIMNEY?
^^^^
Silverscreen: good idea
/me goes inside the CHIMNEY
Sky hook seems like it'd be cool.
Also, stop being so stereotypically Chinese, Lao.
/me watches Dark92Enigma get sucked up the chimney by Santa Claws.

yeah..

I'm good with calwulations.

The camera used in the making of that movie went on to be used in other found-footage movies, such as Cloverfield.
<.<
I missed half an hour of this movie and haven't seen it before so I have no idea what's going on. But it seems pretty awesome

01,11Okay, here's an opportunity that Nolan f**ked up. This guy's name is Mister Reese (mysteries). He clearly has a fair bit of money, is smart enough with numbers and figuring things out, and knows the identity of batman. How come they didn't evolve him into The Riddler?!

Unnr, AJIsAwesome: From earlier (Was late in capping this): http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v135/J.E.Smith/batburger.png
Silverscreen: I think that Nolan said somewhere that he didn´t like the character of the Riddler, as it wasn´t serious enough of a villian
That PMV EQD linked felt more like a animation demo reel than anything else
pretty good though
They should construckt buildings without Windows, for safty mesuers

01,11The riddler isn't a serious enough villain but Joker, Bane and Catwoman are. WHAT?!
Silverscreen: seriously
Riddler not a serious villain?
13joker is a logical progression from batman
MadSurge: Bagpipes /)
WHY SO SERIOUS?
Be fair, Silverscreen. The Joker is a classic batman villain
O noes
Silverscreen I don't see the problem
About the "Watch The World Burn" from before: http://us14.memecdn.com/asshole_o_413614.jpg
Shizuka I was thinking about including this XD but wanted it short
People just dont like the Riddler that much Silverscreen
Silverscreen: people really think that unfortunately :D
13joker is the same level of crazy applied to the bad guys as batman is for the good guys
EspyLacopa: and riddler isnt?
01,11EspyLacopa: So is Penguin, Riddler and Mr. Freeze.
Silverscreen: Batman Forvever didn't portrayed him as a serious villain, that's the problem
Thinking people that can't solve a riddle deserves to die is not something to be taken seriously?
DAT COP IS A SPAH
TAS version of Freeze was awesome.
Oh yeah, that guy in one of the uniform was Joker.

01,11Here's another missed opportunity. This guy is schizophrenic and is threatened by Harvey Dent. It's claimed he's an escapee from Arkham and he has a batshit insane smile that just says "I'll make everyone as mad as I am." Why couldn't he be evolved into The Mad Hatter?!

Lint is dangerous stuff. Keep that stuff off the streets.
I wanna know how the fuck Heath Ledger kept that voice through all of filming...

GOOD COP, BAD COP
...see?
xD
good cop batman cop routine
Silverscreen, hot damn
Random bit of trivia: Batman Begins, the movie this is a sequal to, was originally gonna be directed by the guy who directed Batman and Robin.
Silver: Ledger really dove into this act so damn well, it's why he's so good. Sadly, may also be why he's dead. :/
00,03Batman Forever changed things...
Only Batman can play both good and bad cop
Eddmario: Shumacher? ARE YOU SERIOUS?

BUY SOME APPLES

hes got a rather stylish shirt
Batleper.
twilight_sprinkles: It's fabulous.
Dark92Enigma: Eyup. Because of the failure of Batman and Robin they changed it to Nolan.
I'm not a monster Tom, Well tecnichly I am
tecnicly
Batman and Robin ruined Mr. Freeze, who had been so fantastic in the animated series
no one can RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA like Silverscreen
In fact, it was Schumacher who suggested a darker reboot of the series.

Shizuka Actually, Joker kills his own comrades more than civillians...

Ya know how I got these scars batman? Acne?
Shizuka your probably right
13><
Joker just wants his phone call
13Deadlypon3: that... was a horrible HORRIBLE pun
13i applaud you sir
Shizuka I made a pun!?
Suwet
RUN
lol.
And it was only one day for the cops before retirement!
What doesnt make any sense is that Joker still has any minions after all he does to them
No it's a bagel.
Fun fact, that phone call is a Hollywood myth
Silverscreen: If alive.....Heath Ledger could've done some damn good commercials........like promoting Rice Crispies, which has a BEAR!
Ohai Guys :)
BUT WHO WAS PHONE???
NO, IT'S A TRAP!
hey MaxTheBrony
Heya Lil_B :)

Lil_B: EEEEEEEYUP

GOOD COP, JOKER COP

MaxTheBrony: CUE theme from COPS

Joker looks like he is having the time of this life
"Dear Bruce, I'm a bitch"

Hello Sketch_Toku_Brony
Talk about a bitch
Rachel is really rather reaslistic in such an unrealistic situation.
Harvey Dent is [Redacted]
fuck.... veemi must hate me
A long time ago, I worked for a TANGERINE
xD
And that's why she's the WORST love interest in a BATMAN FILM ever...........but that didn't underwhelm this masterpiece
Things never go well for Batman
dat Tangerine YTP is awesome xD
Gotham needs a nuclear bomb.
Seriously, Gotham is a real shithole.
It needs BANE
:)
"The Bandit....is a tangerine"
IS A TANGERINE
"By burning the TANGERINE"
/me ......if it's FACE.......i'll ACT..........Cross, and i'm NOT
for every great villain... there's a tragedy... But for the best villain...
Aww... Nittany left?
riight
moo
^ I agree
Riddle me this Gotham. Who is Batman?
Why did they have that name for the first place?
I dont get it
He's Big Mclargehuge.
SAY IT!
Hey, Wrek, you got a moment?
Say it don't spray it.
SAY IT!
MaxTheBrony, because he got cops locked up
FAEC
d3rb_: Ah that explains it :) Thank you
eww
That freaky charred Two-Face
OH SHIT
NOW............THAT
How can he stand!?
THAT IS A REAL TWO FACE
That looks awesome
He Fell from a fucking building?
O.o
THAT"S a Two-face I can believe in.
Meanwhile: If I were a superhero, people would DIE.
That's right.
MaxTheBrony he has a cane and cast on
DoctoDoctorWho: Well that's...charming.
/me wave
weeee! money slide!
Look at all that money
MOUNTAIN OF MONY

If people wouldn't die, you wouldn't need a hero.
Deadlypon3 Did he ? I missed it :p
LOADSAMONEY
HERE COMES THE MONEY
Do a Scrooge McDuck in it!
MaxtheBrony you'll see it
All dat money
We got to have.......MONEY
All the plushie we can buy with dat money
gasoline.... Cheap
god damn lag...
gas is cheap ?
compared to other things
Dark92Enigma: Norlan initially considered a more realistical burn for Two Face, but people were so freaked out by it that he opted for a more severe and cartoonish burn
GAS..........CHEAP!? :D
lol
haha
Gas is cheap if you just need enough to start a fire
Thats the real joke :p
^
NO!! WE COULD BUY MUFFINS WITH THAT MONY!!!
A FREAakakakk
If you think gas is cheap you are living in a different time period
the message
How the smell :)
DerpyMuffins compared to high explosives :P
Dark92Enigma: lol reminds me of futurama w/ al gore as a taxi driver "Hey i need that 100$...for a gallon of gas."
Some people just wanna watch the world burn.
Oh, i thought it was Friendship
Gas is cheap in the united states of a merry can compared to Europe
And then we see how loyal is a hungry dog!

Deadlypon3: Yeah but still his eye was on the left side , same side as the joker

Brad[Laptop], now you realize why my name is written with Royal Canterlock

True chaos!
"But when I say that one little old mare will die...." GRANNY SMITH NOOOOOOO

Joker is so Discord right now
My cat was peeing all over the place, she had an urinarie infection

Chaos is a bear?
Blood for the blood god, skulls for the skull throne, milk for the Khorne flakes.
Human form of Discord

Joker doesn't care if he dies or lives

Dark92Enigma: Oh, my.
Dark92Enigma: poor thing :(

Poor Murcielago
Its awesome how they made Two face face :p
Two Faces Face*
SO MANY EXPLOSIONS!!!
AJIsAwesome: MadSurge The cat is gone, but she's cured right now
kaplowowow
Inb4 other trivia
Dark92Enigma: Okay.
cool guys dont look at explostions
boom boom boom boom boom boom sparkle boom
I lovw this scence
13it's a living!

lol, this bit
THE JOKER...........JUST FRIED THE COKE
Mr Ledger ladies and gents.
i didnt do it :P
xD
lol
And it stopped
xD
hahah
Cool guys never look at explosions
Nope, it's good
Micheal Bay just came
lol
super ded
xD
:D
dat micheal bay sneaked in on the set.
so wait, did two-face die :'(
01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The lag between explosions at the hospital was a goof with the special effects. Heath Ledger had to keep in character throughout the take and actually jumped when the explosion finally happened.
sneaked*
that's the power of the MICE MAFIA
Even the joker's bombs dont work right sometimes
rdibp: nope
CrimsonPhoenix:
Dark92Enigma: then they miss the fun
Meanwhile: the whole point of being a follower of khorne is canterlocks, if one doesnt want endless yelling, they pick slannesh.
looks like these explosived had some fireworks in them :/
And Michael Bay went through 5 changes of pants from that one scene.
and nopony likes slannesh
Did you know, there was a COCA-COLA in that hospital!? the COKE has indeed been FRIED
AJIsAwesome: :D
What's so good in this movie is that most stuff in it are legitimate
seems legit
DoctoDoctorWho: except 4chan
MadSurge: . . . true
what the hell is SCN?
gcn*
I maintain that Joker's little skit here is basically Hannity's nightly skit.
looks like SAW news

What's odd is that Dent's logic makes sense in a really sick way. Probability at its purest form *can't* be biased, it's just numbers. It's people who make it that way.
Batman needs to stop smoking 80 packs a day.
What???/ Batman got heads and he died
161........with BATMAN!?
even 10+ is bad enough
I am so confused, why did he kill batman?
MadSurge: and he always had
HE BE DED SOON
05,15so he called tails for himself
because rachel made him emo
SUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUPER DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED
Heads :P
The coin has heads on both sides, he uses the burnt side to decide death.
but tails meant that he dies
head means that you live
there is no fun in this. please try another stream provider for the pony episodes
that awkward one in a million moment when dent's coin lands on its side.
/me If it's HEAD.....i'll live.......TAILS.....and i'll die
batman got the burnt side
01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Medical Research shows that Two Face could not survive more than a couple of hours in his condition (mainly from the infection he'd get from having so much underflesh exposed). However, the reason given for surviving so long is due to his adreneline rush for revenge. After the scene at 250 52nd street, Dent would have died anyway. The only really unrealistic aspect
1,11is his exposed eye remaining so clean and uninfected.
o
DB_Brony: yes
Heads I win, tails you lose.
13they did a bad job making the burnt side stick out... it still looks like good side heads to me
13every shot it falls
:'( RIP

Silverscreen I think it's implied that he's blind on that side

Now you know what we need? a confusing monoloug
He killed...the cop at the bar, presumably the mob boss and his driver, plus the one guy who was outside the before the car left...who was the fifth?
IT'S not what i am on the INSIDE.......WHAT I DO.......DEFINES ME

05,15WHERE IS HE
Can we pull the plug on Veemi now?
AHHH They said it!
01,11SILVERSCREEN'S REVIEW: The Dark Knight. What a movie. It's a film that just feels big. Everything is done on an epic and grand scale, and everything is giving that dark and gritty yet realistic edge. All the characters are portrayed perfectly, and the action is top notch. However, I do have some problems with it, the biggest being that it drags on for too long.
01,11The talking aspect is nice, but it gets a little grating how they have to explain everything going on. Batman is a superhero and a detective first, the drama should come second. It’s true that the point behind the Joker is a psychotic mind game from start to finish. The Joker in the Animated Show and even in the original Batman movie did the exact same thing, only they managed it
1,11through their actions rather than their words, causing chaos and mental breakdowns with mind games designed through traps and events.
01,11That said, however, I love the Greek Tragedy style that fuels the story gives, and if they just cut down HOW MUCH everyone talked in the second act, it would have been much stronger. 8/10.
No bob? 0/10
/me WHY SO SERIOUS!? M/10

HERE ARE YOU CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT

Silverscreen: STILL, what would you think if the soundtrack from The original Batman movie was in this masterpiece?
Silverscreen: you have a funny way to typ 10/10
Quorl_Changeling: because the AI work would blow our budget, I'm going to have to say no
8.9/10 it was good, but it Rachel kinda ruined it
Silverscreen: Dat Bright wall of text
Shizu: It must have friends.

any good pics come out of it?

are LimeV and Mips still in Maintenance? If not, please please please, switch to one of them (preferably LimeV :3 )

Quorl_Changeling: let the best bronies assue the controls?

MOVIE TRIVIA: JORDAN GOLDBERG IS NOT RELATED TO JEFF GOLDBERG

MakerDusk: Yes. Where all input from all bronies participating is parsed, then implimented. with mods of course
what is the next movie?
something about independant film makers
13geez they're still going through the cast list?
13oh wait those are the crew
05,15A surprisingly good movie is next.
MEMORISE THOSE NAMES
there are over 9000 cast members
THEY WORKED HARD ON THIS MOVIE
ds
13hey look there's lauren faust
11,01And I hope to get to see it all.
01,11Dark92Enigma: I think playing over the original Batman Soundtrack to this film would be interesting, but it'd have to be done right in order for it to really work.
13awwww you missed it
<_<
rdibp: >9000 Cast&Crew

Nittany_Discord: what's the B movie?
nobody call him fat, or half life 3 will NEVER happen
<_<
11,01Lost in Oblivion I think.
05,15Half Life 3 will happen someday. and it will be glorious
00,03Dat Hat Trick Catering~
Sundaysmile: it will never happen anyways
11,01Hopefully I'm alive when HL3 comes out.
MakerDusk: Lol
11,01And HL3 is not another DNF.
inb4 vapourware
Nittany_Discord: i think ozzy osborne will die before half life 3 is released
I never played Half Life..
i bet when half life 3 comes out, it will sell 10 million copies in the first hour
half life 3 will never come out and it will suck, if i keep thinking this i'll be pleasantly suprised if it does come out
05,15"Grandpa, tell us the story about...the Half Life" "Well son, we've been waiting many years"
Oh my god veemi, I've never heard of you before but you're not making a very good first impression
ekips.... stop what you are doing
and go play half life NOW
half life 3 will come out on December 22, 2012
00,03I never played the original Half Life...
does Black Mesa count too? I began playing it a while ago Sundaysmile
ekips, serriously, play it
Fluttercry: "they say that one day, when all the planets align and the 2nd coming happens, it will be released"
no it does not count
11,01HL and HL2 are two of the best games ever.
I agree with Silverscreen here.....this movie is big in all aspects, and unlike the original Batman movie, there's a whole array of characters that enjoyable or not, are still memorable and give the adequate atmospehere for the scene.......and it shows here. However, there might be too much exposition in the second act, but that's a minor detail. Batman was good, but Heath Ledger as JOKER was incredible. Truly, this movie led the
d
8/10
It kinda counts. It misses out the last four or so chapters though.
DAT Joker BGM
play half life 1, then 2 then the following episodes, THEN black mesa
ekips: its a remade version of half life, so yeah i guess
05,15The end to Half Life was REALLY weak

WHORE YOURSELF
Ponies!

LESSON ZERO FTW1
out of nowhere, ponies
idk, i personally liked all the exposition, it wasnt pointless or empty, and it was quite interesting. whereas the original movie was like, meh, just a good guy vs a nutty bad guy
Chrysalis, that diamond pony
My little ad that covers the whole fucking stream
dis episode for the shitzillionth time
twilight_sprinkle: Agreed.
how meta
chacklistception
Lesson Lag-o, yay!
Chrysalis: butt stallion?
FRACK! Still Lag!
01,11Okay, here's my assestment on the Jackson vs. Ledger thing:
01,11Jack Nicholson as the Joker at first seems to be perfect, but when you really look at it, it's just Jack Nicholson playing the typical insane Jack Nicholson character. Heath Ledger as the Joker was a different entity altogether. This is the guy that played a prissy nobody in A knights tale, and is suddenly this scary as f**k and diabolically ingenius mastermind with a f**ked up moral
1,11outlook.
Wrek's favorite episode
my little lag, my little lag
Bronysith lol, its awesome
ponies? FUCK YES :D

Rarity ALWAYS has a metal breakdown
mental
Silverscreen: if you compare rainbows 10 second episode as a breakdown compared to pinkie's and twilight's, you're the insane one
metal breakdown
rdibp: Rarity's breakdown came in ''Dressed for Success''
05,15Breakdowns are no fun.
CrimsonPhoenix or atleast close to one
she listens to heavy metal all day
or wood
hopefully we get another luna episode in S3 and applejack actually gets her own song
01,11Oh yes, there's that too. Suited for Success broke her, but not due to her personality as much due to her friends being picky.
metal breakdown. Make a song titled that

has applejack had a breakdown as bad as the rest?

Sundaysmile: Not so much, but she had one of her own, in Applebuck season
True, but her breakdown wasn't as bad as the other Mane 5.

wouldn't compare that to as insane as the rest

I was playing Borderlands 2 with Kenne anc company

Inb4 Mr Staypuft.
I voted that for A MONTHS ago
00,03Because no one likes ghosts!
05,15I'm very pleased with this
lol
Please Be Dead Alive
That'd be gold.
PLEASE!
11,01Now to B.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: What're you doing?
It would be PERFECT for October
01,11Ghosties should hide.
05,15okay, next we have MrBen with Yu-Gi-Oh! The Pyramid of Light for B movie
05,15...yay?
00,03Ghosties if you see this, HIDE!
fuck me
11,01Wut?
13OHGODKILLITWITHFIRE
01,11oh.
YGO?
Huh. Yugioh movie.
00,03Yugioh <3
01,11...
FUCKING REALLY?
Nothing right now Captain McAwesomeFace
01,11great.
00,03NO!
The yugioh mov...oh dear.
NO FUCK NO
00,03Its GOOD!
/me will make sure to watch the abridged version first
FUCK THAT SHIT
Oh dear oh dear.
13how did we miss this on our validation pass
no no no no no
Wait
05,15So we cool with that?
00,03Because Blue Eyes Whute Dragons are AWESOME!
doesn't even count as a B
YUGIOH WAS VOTED?
00,03white*
WHAT?
That...counts.
11,01I'd like to reroll honestly.
/me 13throws a flag on the play and goes to the ref booth
00,03NO!
But it's going to suck.
00,03Keep it!
01,11No, it's not. It's a mediocre extended Yu-Ghi-Oh episode.
THATS NOT A MOVIE
00,03It's a B movie!
DESPITE BEING ONE :/
If the actual thing gets worst movie clause, we should air the LittleKuriboh version on saturday.
dammit Scoots STOP DEFENDING IT!
EspyLacopa: agreed
WHO WOULD DO THAT
11,01But we can bring this up to a majority vote.
00,03It was still shown in theatres. Keep
WHO
01,11The only reason it qualifies as a "movie" is because it got a threatrical release.
11,02O.O
that's who
...
I say reroll in this case
really?
00,03And it's longer than an hour...
11,02They made a YuGiOh movie? D:
nah, we need another WMC :p
Fuck it. B Movies are -supposed- to be bad.
Are we forgetting that?
1390 minutes is the low end of movie length
^nope
No
Meanwhile you should set Captain McAwesomeFace to ping you
it's an extended YGO episode
That's not true at all.
no they are not
no way good sir
11,02Then it's alright I would imagine.
B movies /can/ be bad
00,03Stilll, most movies are about 90 minutes
yeah
13THE REFEREES WILL CONSULT THE REVIEW BOOTH AFTER THIS BREAK
11,02Just be prepared for WMC.
but that doesn't mean we have to show them
not supposed to be
I think YGO is gonna blow
In fact I KNOW it blows
which one is it?
bc it's goddamn TGO
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Say it again
ahem YGO
it's Pyramid of Light
Ah
05,15Mods go on strike. Replacement mods will vote :p
13TOUCHDOWN!
Captain McAwesomeFace
back when i was actually a fan of Yugioh
That now pings me.
now the manga on the other hand
isn't that bad
00,03And it looks like we have a keeper!
i bought the movie SPECIFICALLY for the Blue Eyes Shining Dragon
bc it's not a marketing scheme
Cool i can't set T because everytime someone writes Don't i would get pinged
And now stream is buffering...
01,11unfortunately, yes.
05,15Next up is AJisBestPony with Read it and Weep for Pony Episode #1
mine too
01,11And we have buffer as well.
so anyway whats A?
must be Comcast
13we need a +m for +m...
13anyway
/me 13smacks comcast
i mustve missed it
Stream fails, switch over, and it fails again.
oh sweet
01,11Hey, that seemed to work.
11,02They should remake that YuGiOh movie with Justin Bieber voicing Dark YuGi.
00,03Because Bald Ponies are best ponies
props to whoever picked that
13anyway
Goddammit
13so the mods have been thinking
they say it counts
13we watch lesson zero too much
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-
01,11And what's Pony Episode 2?
13and luna eclipsed
/me explodes
inb4 WMC
05,15Finally ezio_auditore with A Friend in Deed
01,11...
01,11no.
oh definitely
01,11no no no fucking no
I wonder if they'd consider adding to the staff what with losing kirz and now silver.
05,15now Shizuka has an important announcement
00,03Anyone who chooses them are *****
01,11We watch that damn episode every other f**king week.
13so
13we have a new method
13If you will direct your attention to http://derpy.me/bronystatebacklog
technically, Silver never actually did anything
ever
13You will see we have added a page for pony episodes
13Starting next week, the lottery survey will change from a text field for pony episodes to a dropdown box
I wouldn't say ever, just not in more recent times.
YGO is gonna blow
also brb again
05,15could always do the TGOTAS version...
13All 52 episodes are entered into the list, winners are removed
they did
otakon: Yes, but the abridged version is faaaabulous
05,15if it gets WMC that is
13The list is shuffled and put into a dropdown, to eliminate positioning bias
they did
they also Abridged the other YGO movie
13Lesson Zero, May The Best Pet Win, Read It and Weep, and A Friend In Deed will be ineligible for vote until all pony episodes have been run
13This will include episodes released during Season 3
the one with like, a billion dragons
With the guy who wants to save the world by destroying the card games?
01,11But that's not going to stop people from complaining at us for cheating when a Mod wins anyway.
inb4 you activated my trap card
13In short, more variety!
Frankly kirz I wish you hadn't left, newsletter went to shit.
>.>
05,15In short more variety, and 6 month cycle time
05,15Hope you enjoyed Lesson Zero..
I agree Shizuka
More variation!
05,15:(
01,11Alright, and now it's my turn for an announcement.
This may or may not backfire massively. :P
01,11I regret to inform you that this weekend may be the last time that you see me in BronyState. I am graduating on October 2nd, and afterwards I shall be moving back home. Unfortunately, that means my internet will not only be limited, but also extremely slow. Therefore, I feel it would be best to go on hiatus from being a mod of BronyState, with the possibility of my return being
It'll not backfire
1,11uncertain. It has been fun being a part of it for another glorious summer, and I was happy to get to know everyone and enjoy the fun times that this site has brought. Thank you, Everyone.
05,15oh people are going to be pissed
05,15that's inevitable
It'll cause a change that alot will enjoy
Rather a mass then a single person
Oh most definitely.
I would hope, Shizuka or whoever sets up the survey, that they'll put that link to the backlog as well as the rules, in the survey or the survey emale.
I'm just preparing for the inevitable fallout.
*email
I can't imagine it's likely to cause that much backlash.
11,01I'm OK with a hiatus. I hope you come back.
Meanwhile, we're talking about the internet here.
11,01Hiatus vs. retirement.
Speaking as a long-time member of the WoW community, anything done EVER will have a backlash.
05,15EspyLacopa that can be done
It just means that we won't be watching Lesson Zero, Party of One, Sonic Rainboom and Luna Eclipsed as much.,
which I have issue with
Oh I know. It'll still lead to a backlash. :P
01,11Back home I have Dialup. It sucks and it's all I have available during the times we do BMN.
As someone who was part of the WoW community for a long time...oh god you're right.
/me pokes Lasharus
If you want to watch those specific episodes more, find them on youtube ^_^
I loved WoW's latest patch before MoP.
We're toast. Crispy burnt toast.
SO MUCH YES
wub
<3 Silverscreen, I'll miss seeing you around, drop in now and then whenever you feel like it. :) Going to miss your trivias which are always a fun side entertainment from the main movies. <3 Godspeed.
back
Where was Gondor when I forgot to prepare where was Gondor?
Also farewell Silverscreen
inb4 Meanwhile with a Where was Gondor joke
http://aijaa.com/Bcuynv
I'm reminded of that line from the HHGttG.
Silverscreen: thanks for everything, may the force be with you
So near yet so far kirz.
We'll miss you, Silverscreen.
computer was acting up, so i had to scan it
Silverscreen that's sad, does that mean we are going to get a new mod?
:p
Silverscreen, are you sure that's still the case? About your home still having dialup?
RIP SilverScreen :'(
Two things. 1) "Just be prepared for WMC." <--- Uh, I've seen Pyramid of Light, it is *not* WMC bad. And if it gets WMC'd then that's a sham honestly, since shit much MUCH worse has been shown and not WMC'd. >_>
Another mod going
stay pony, Silverscreen...
05,15No chat rage about new pony system? Guys I am proud!
"Okay, we're adding a new raid" "Blizz, u suk, cater to us casuals!" "Fine, we'll add in the new Darkmoon Faire" "Blizz, u suck, nobody cares, make raids!" "Okay, fuck it, we'll do both, AND add in 3 more instances!" "Blizz, u suk, u spread urselvs too thin"
Dont
kirzstryfe: Good try. :D
Silverscreen "the force will be with u..always.."
Been good knowing ya Silverscreen
With God creating the universe and it being widely regarded as a bad move.
I'm getting to it, Fluttercry. ^^
Silverscreen, You'll always have a place in our hearts
Fluttercry: Honestly, I love it. MUCH more organized.
Do the lottery results mean that we can't suggest made for TV movies?
Actually Shizuka we already saw both Friend In Deed and Read It and Weep this morning during the marathon...but I guess Hub streams are the exception to the new rule right?
Fluttercry: im fucking happy about it, im sick of seeing the same episodes every damn week
13seriously, there was more rage about closing side rooms during the week than there is about eliminating pony episodes for six months
Fluttercry: It makes sense, rather have a variation then a stale stagnation. :)
Catering to casuals. Now that did grind my gears.
(Literally what happened with 4.3)
13hub streams would be the exception
:p
13we'll probably tweak the process when the season starts
Lasharus: At least Pandaria is awesome.
Fluttercry, It's a good way to do it I think.
It's pretty much literally what happened with patch 4.3 Meanwhile.
so whats the next movie\?
Very true EspyLacopa.
Shizuka: Like 6 months to 3 months etc etc
I'd be leveling now if it weren't for a headache the size of the sun.
What I meant to say is that are made for TV movies allowed to be suggested in the lottery
If you want to play at the high level, learn to not suck.
It's sort of prohibitive.
some movie about amatuer film directors or someting
Oh, incidentally.
it's like a documentary
I'm at 89 now and just starting on the Dread Wastes
05,15ROHKARA those are B movies
Wait
rdibp THE WOST POSSIBLE THING its called Living in Oblivion
/me smacks TrixieLiesHardCore.
Silverscreen: Sooo... revote by the WHOLE bronystate? :P
is it marble hornets?
05,15Sundaysmile it's a dark comedy about film making
:P
Sorry kirz, reflex to being poked. It was delayed.
I'm not actually mad about the new system, though...it really seems to eliminate the point of voting. There's 52 eps, so if the rotation is 6 months....there's really not many options to be voting on at all, at which point you may end up saving time just picking yourselves. :P
I hope not
Thanks, I was wondering about that
man, i need to find the person who made the custom desktop ponies >.>;
kirzstryfe i don't lie i blur the truth a little
Derpy_Hooves
I have the file still
me
what is everyone talking about?
Derpy_Hooves: Their site's still down.
Imight be able to email it to you
Shizuka: I still don't get why you say we watch Lesson Zero too much. I've been voting in the lotto for several months now and this is the first time I've seen it win BMN. We've only played it during Wrek's birthday on a non-BMN
silverscreen leaving
I.e. you're still pulling it out of your arse, you just won't clarify which arse.
"kirzwubssilver" would be an outright lie :P
05,15JESmith71 that's just an example, several episodes are overplayed
Enjoy those mental images by the way. I know I sure as hell didn't.
Fluttercry that thing cannot be counted as a comedy, pretty sure you need jokes and barable actors/charachters
13lesson zero, luna eclipsed, last roundup
Silver: No, that's the thing. It doesn't suck. It's not great, yes. Not really good, yes. But it's not bad. Certainly not WMC bad.
13seems we always get those
I know i sorta already told you this via PM, but i can't express how much i enjoyed watching/reviewing the movies with you, and we will recieve you with open arms and muffins when you come back......
Party of One
Sonic Rainboom
Every other week.
i mean, what is everyone talking about a new system?
kirzstryfe is in denial about Silver
I've been putting in my vote for A Canterlot Wedding Part 2 for the past month or two.
05,15Dester I found it humurous.
kirzstryfe x Silver OTP
and then everypony requested Winter Wrap up
Shizuka: and dont forget a friend in need
I know i sorta already told you this via PM, but i can't express how much i enjoyed watching/reviewing the movies with you, and we will recieve you with open arms and muffins when you come back......See you again, Silverscreen.
rdibp: Where you reading what Shizuka said?
it's mall
nyope :3
...
Shizuka: I mean I changed things up and put Bird In The Hoof as my vote since I never saw that one. Hasn't been played here because I would have seen it
aww
Lol, dat intermission
Fluttercry well I have NO ideo how
Canon.
yep
he din't say anything
I still wish we would always get the list of rejected votes after every lottery...
So, mods, any way we can "vote" for the majority of that we should skip or reroll the B Movie?
05,15PONY I'm doing that as we speak
13kmplayer why you making this sound weird... or am i just so used to winamp's eq i forgot what this sounds like normal..
Fluttercry, beautiful
i think i broke Kirz
That'd be a first.
01,11I have to disagree, CK|Ded. The story was weak at best and went all over the damn place trying to explain this rather sudden and sporadic threat to the world. It was either rushed or taking too long to get to the point.
Let me try TheGreatAndPowerfulT.
i think b movie should be played, the comentary would be worth it
I'm not going to get into my opinion on Silver here, it would detract from the seemingly cohesive unit facade that is the bronystate staff
/me smacks kirzstryfe upside the head.
d3rb_: Don't think it has a rifftrax
Bah, you could've waited a split second there kirz.
By comparison, the recent anniversary movie is WAY WAY worse
Implying that facade holds together.
i mean the chat sorry Vordox
And really, you just started a rumour about it, that's as bad if not worse. :P
Vordox: get down from there
CK|Ded: That's why you watch the abridged version instead.
:P
Is another movie gonna play after 4 minutes?
You're about as cohesive looking as the middle east.
Just say 'no comment' next time. :P
In that it basically exists to shit all over the show's canon :P
#TwilightSparkle
ALL of the show canon.
Am I the only one here who doesn't even know what this yugio is???
Bronysith: But I want to cause a riot so we can have a majority vote of rerolling the B movie!
let me squash the rumor then, if I had a chance to kick him in the face, I wouldn't be opposed to taking it
Yes PONY
pony its crap
Neat.
know you know
It's not, that's the thing. >_>
The more you know.
Silverscreen: NOT TO MENTION, justr like the Pokemon movie, it HAMMERS the moral in our heads
now**
Yes, MINECRAFT!
ugh
so would do Meanwhile to trixie kirzstryfe and we still ship them
BTW kirz, why're you never in the fortress anymore?
If you don't know what Yugioh is, go hit up youtube for "CardGamesFTW" user channel.
^
This was the best music disc in the game
01,11The only time I enjoyed Pyramid of Light was when my high school friends (who were all girls) muted the movie and dubbed over it to make every male character gay for each other. It was hilarious.
because nobody else was
C418
EspyLacopa: i met little kuriboh
That is LittleKuriboh, who makes the awesome that is Yugioh Abridged
Oy.
I'm back now. :P
Silverscreen: Win
PONY its an aniome television series centered around a card game and an ancient pharoah that sometimes inhabits the body of a small child
11,01Silverscreen: XD
and I've been at work most evenings lately, during the week I'm only online 1-3 hours
Stream YuGiOh BBT abridged!
Silverscreen: wish i was there back then
Haha this pic with batman
Silverscreen: :D
Fascinatingly? The manga it's based on is actually really good (and absurdly dark)
Dester: Aka "Japan Japan child japan japana world threat, japan, child save world"?
Which means you're online during the same time as I am, mostly.
Yu-Gi-Oh started out just fine. It's got weaknesses, but it's okay as a series. And the first movie's honestly just too plain, but it's not WMC bad. I would actually be forced to laugh if it was voted WMC because of some of the absolute shit we've watched that never made that vote.
the better question you should be asking is why nobody is in any of the side rooms :P
Remember, you're a fair few timezones away from me. :P
PONY NO its way way bad
what is streaming now?
Seriously. The phaoroh? Kills a guy by challenging him to a guy wherein they have to reach into a shoe to grab coins. A shoe which contains a deadly scorpion. An -agitated- deadly scorpion.
Dester, google gave me some idea
Season Zero and the original manga of yugioh is fucking awesome
Vordox yeah, anime anime
pony_672167, rofl
PONY: A better analogy is "it's Magic the Gathering for more impressionable teenagers"
Because the side rooms are still +i.
atm, there is an intermission
In another "game", the phaoroh sets a guy on fire for attempting to rob a restaraunt.
01,11CK|Ded: Ever since WMC was made, most if not all of the movies that are Absolute Shit have been put on that list.
CK|Ded, made in Japan apparently
You know whats funny, Deepercutt is working on a Yu Gi Oh ytp :D
just putting that out there
Toot.
Silver: Like what? Last I saw the count was at two. XD
TOOT TOOT TOOT TOOT TOOT TOOT TOOT TOOT TOOT TOOT TOOT TOOT TOOT TOOT TOOT TOOT
And we have watched a lot more than two bad movies.

kirzstryfe: :I

01,11Yu-Gi-Oh was good from the first season until the God Cards arc happened. When it did the Virtual World story arc, I felt it started jumping sharks.
my cell phone is off
good
video taping a camera with a camera, this movie is made of meta
lol

Aaaaand mods pics! :$
The only WMC's I remember are The Last Airbender (which sucked so much crap that its mention makes my blood boil) and Babes in Toyland. Which ones did I miss, because I seem to recall most of the other baddies still getting the benefit of being played twice. :P
:O
so kirzstryfe MvM after the movie ?
Babes in Toyland, rest in peace the few people who we lost to that movie.
CK|Ded: Epic movie
Woah it buffered on 0:42 for me
Still want to se The Room by wiseau
i love that movie
CK|Ded: WMC?
It's the sign:O
I still say that Spiders web was worse than Babes in Toyland
Dester: You do nauht.
I always read dat "Shifuka"
The_Browncoat: That one was played twice, IIRC.
sweet,perfect timing :D
the room is so bad its so good
Meanwhile that's the point, a bad movie to riff on with friends
And despite a lot of people saying it should have been WMC'd, I don't think it actually was.
Meanwhile: I know I do.
CK|Ded: i checked the movie list, and The Last Airbender was listed as ''this can be seen again''..........WHY?
can anypony help me think of a name for my OC?
You do nauht. Oh hi Mark.
I don't think my tf2 is even close to being updated
haven't run steam in about 2 weeks
Dark92Enigma: .....WHAT.
Apokalipse: Babes in Toyland sounds like pr0n flick, tbh
DoctoDoctorWho: Image/hobby?
DoctoDoctorWho, you need to be bit more detailed than that
Meanwhile Hi doggy!

SirGanjalf: Cannot unsee.
DoctoDoctorWho: no :D
Tell me you're lying, Dark.

Tell me you're lying. :|
Meanwhile: Noooooooooooooo.
hai BaconMane
Dark92Enigma: because people MUST see it, to learn how NOT to do a movie!
01,11This movie is just strange. No idea how else to describe it. Just watch.
Oh no BaconMane
Hide everyone!
What does WMC mean again? :$
CK|Ded: OPEN a separate window, and you'll find out
DoctoDoctorWho: Mark Safford
Meanwhile your my favoirte customer, thaty awfulness puts it into the funny place
AJIsAwesome: Worst Movie Clause
Unnr|Laptop: Okay.
AJIsAwesome: worst movie clause
Aka this movie is so bad, it shall never be played again
Thanks, Dark92Enigma
Unnr|Laptop: aaaah
Nittany_Discord: It's raining over here, actually.
Oooh... I haven't seen Survival Style 5+ for a long time, should probably start voting for it.

Unnr|Laptop: well thats just like, you;re opinion man

He is a tall unicorn stallion, a hair shorter than celestia. He has a steel-grey coat and dark blue mane. Im trying to incorporate the word "Steel"
11,01I don't have the money to even chase that storm.
rdibp: but its voted on...
what's the name of this movie?
^3^ /)?
That Beattles movie with the blue meanie isn't on the worse movie clause, right?
0,5Heeey wait a second
rdibp: *(\

TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I'll play MvM.

It IS marked as watchable again
Nittany_Discord: i dont even get any proper storms near me. all i get are a few wimpy storms that last 30 mins top
bye rdibp
11,01At least I don't need to worry about it destroying my house.
What the shit.
That movie was WMC'd.
Brony_From_Kent Never seen a black and white movie?
twilight_sprinkle: T__T
:|
Brony_From_Kent: It's an INDIE movie - no colors for you!
11,01Or my grandmother's house.
Cool Captain McAwesomeFace
Unnr|Laptop: ikr, i like rain and storms..
CK|Ded: you checked it yet?
one does not simply leave coffee be if it is bad
*ahhhhhh*, movies, runescape, and a bunch of bronies to talk to
it's awesome
...And why isn't "Spider's Web: A Pig's Tale" on the WMC'd?
twilight_sprinkle: *nods* There is nothing quite like watching a huuuuge lightning storm roll in.
killerpony7733: nope.
eeyup
Also, Silver, according to the backlog, I see two movies. Should be three because FUCK The Last Airbender, but yeah. "All" of the bad movies? Not really, dude. :/
01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: This film was Shot in 16 days.
was played before the WMC
11,01Bronysith: Are you wanting me to clean the tornado?
CK|Ded: IT SAYS: B Movie, Last Airbender ''This movie can be shown again!''
13EspyLacopa: as i said earlier in the year when being questioned about it... no idea why my records said it was WMC, but it wasn't
13it's been corrected since march
Silverscreen: ouch
Nittany_Discord: no, its just a twister maid corset jeez
01,11The Last Airbender was shown before WMC was instigated.
Oh
11,01OK.
That explains everything
CK|Ded: Also The last Airbender, while bad, can be made fun of in a fun way
what was the first wmc?
11,01Thought Last Airbender was shown after WMC was created.
Silver: No, no it clearly wasn't
13dat retitle
Unnr|Laptop: and looking at the awesome lightnings, although my window at this apt goes straight out to the neighboring building, so no view either way..
I think originally it was WMC'd but then it was changed later.
01,11The WMC was made for Babes in Toyland.
CK|Ded:
Babes and Epic Movie are so bad you can´t even make fun of them bad
It came literally the week after Babes.
>_>
05,15Shizuka those are two different posts I think
Look at the calendar.
Silverscreen And the epic movie.
Buried was a great movie
01,11Which, ironically, is a movie I like.
Sokka: "well the effects were decent."
13that they are
And I *know* that the mods WMC'd it.
Silverscreen: Bummer, i' won't get to see this movie, i kinda like it for HOW bad it is
Woah black and white?
Silverscreen: which movie again?
I thought this movie was in color?
I recognise that face anywhere.
not even the face,just the eyes are enough
Silverscreen: no really, i like ''Babes in Toyland'' too......
13CUE THE SUN
Huh. You guys showed Black Rock Shooter? Was it any good?
Flame on.
Wasn't there an MST3K for Babes in Toyland?
lol
90% of the chat didn't get it
Thank you Fluttercry
Oh cool, my movies ARE valid
13suddenly color
And... COLOR
budget rises...
90% of the chat doesn't know why they shouldn't ask for ponies.
13i should tell km to desaturate so it's all black and white :3
13mfw no one got the cue the sun reference
13whyyyyyy
So yeah. If Pyramid of Light gets WMC'd, I call foul. It's not nearly as bad as you're making it sound Silver, and given that the WMC title apparently doesn't rest on TLA which is a WAY worse movie, yeah.... >_>
Because it's just too obscure?
13how is the truman show obscure
The what?
Sorry to sound bitchy about it, but honestly you're overhamming how bad it is.
Kandarihu: no there isn't
I'm with Meanwhile here.
"The what?"
13sigh..
Kandarihu: i looked it and no lick
luck*
13ponies have no culture..
are we streaming the second movie?
0,5DAMN IT U GUISE
0,5HOW CAN U NOT KNO
or did it end
0,5GOODNETH
truman show is obscure because it came out a long, long, long time ago
cowvarkian: this is it
twilight_sprinkle: my stream isnt working
13so the rest of the movie is them trying to get this scene?
No offense of course, Shizuka. :P
Or perhaps it's because it came out in 1998.
01,11Looking into it myself, I have to agree on TLA.
cowvarkian: well theres a stream, try refreshing, we switched to mips
When I would have been...6.
twilight_sprinkle: I am refreshing
Shizuka thatg would make this movie 20 percent cooler
13no really is the rest of the movie them trying to get this take?
so many younglings
05,15Just in case any of you missed it, here's a link to the list of entries, hopefully this helps you guys out https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlUTJdk0fIaNdDlEaVRTRWNmcXZwejhycnNaZFhoUkE
13crossing into overly long gag territory here
i takre that back, it would make the movie barable
I can't spell today
05,15Shizuka nah.
It could be worse, Shizu. We could be watching The Room. ....no, wait, this scene basically looks like a verbatim rip from The Room. Never mind.
05,15they move on...eventually
i can see why this is a b movie
Shizuka, no. It moves beyond... THIS scene
Argh
I'm 25.
truman show was never popular or aired enough in mexico that's my story and i'm sticking to it
this download thing won't let me close
B? this is a f***ing Z movie!
I'm 19.
Bonus points if grandma's next line involves how she has breast cancer
11,01The Room is a test of patience though not as much so as Babes in Toyland.
there we go
CK DED the room is so bad its funny, its like an accedental black comedy
It's from the States. My sense of humour diverges too much from the US's to enjoy most of what comes from there.
At least from US mainstream TV.
01,11I have to say, this is pretty realistic in how much a pain in the ass it can be to get one scene right.
was a Tom Hanks movie, was a good one
Silverscreen filmschool?
13why don't you put the boom on a stick
Oh, it's a film.
waaait, kung fu hustle isnt A.
05,15There was a Truman Show reference...and I missed it!?
05,15NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Yeah, then I'm definitely out.
Nittany_Discord: True, but The Room also has one of the best Rifftrax and can be alot of fun in terms of audience participation
13never understood why the whole boom thing is a problem.. take muscle fatigue out of the equation
What year was this film made? I'm guessing 2003?
05,15I love that movie. Jim Carrey was so good in that
whelp Im out, fics wont write themselves
UncouthLurker: the room with rifftraz, id love to see that
what do you mean twilight_sprinkle
"May I make a suggestion?"
"Run."
01,11Dester: Graduating with a degree in Video work.
Ohh god i thougt someone was breaking into my house!!
well, got my new A movie :)
bye bye bronystate
01,11Brony_From_Kent: 1995

Have fun DoctoDoctorWho
alexxm: well im looking at the movie list, and kung fu hustle was classified as A. it only had a budget of 20 mil..
wait
They should just do the scene and then a voiceover in post.
0,5I want Smokey and the Bandit! :I
or did we already switch to the 7.5 system for movie voting
I've been alternating The Matrix and The Thing in my A movie slot.
11,01I miss Jim Carrey.
oh look
11,01I haven't seen him in anything in a long time.
I was 14
Ill keep chat open if anypony needs to talk tho, bye.
LOL
dafuq
Pfft.
WHAT
Is everybody hurt?
Why did she ask that?
Fox and the Hound is B movie?
This scene is CURSED.
01,11And that's why all open-faced lights have a wire frame around the bulb.
Murphy's Law is stron in this one.
Smokin'
Simple scene...
Foreshadowing!
:D

Oh, wait.
Ok guyse, going out again. See you for the podcast! And again, goodbye Silverscreen :(
01,11Bye MadSurge
Hey all!

Thanks very much, whoever found this movie :)
Duh
0,5Jim Carrey is hilarious
That would make sense. >_>
You're not getting any tonight, Mr Boom Guy.
13DID SOMEBODY SAY BOOM?
Buscemi has directed plenty of movies, but not this one?
11,01But he can do serious roles well.
13sorry, spongebob forbidden season 4 there..
No, not this one.
:o
Grandma has the short term memories
05,15Meanwhile The Matrix was shown too recently
Her line is"Ellen, I have no memory of this whatsoever."

Were they even filming?

Shoot the fucking scene
This is what you get for watching B movies Kiddies.
Or maybe you should do a cut, like the guy suggested
05,15Yeah...that's a running theme in this movie
Shizuka, yes. We realize that.
Im still looking for another A to vote for
Get more bored. it will get on with it.
???
Shizu, I have no memory of that whatsoever.
nvra;o
her mother?
Shizuka: Why do I suspect that we'll be 88 mins in on this scene?

"Yu-Gi-Oh"??

damm it!!
05,15the last 24 minutes weren't even real
Oh god, Buschemi in his pants.
I still don´t think Moon is a B movie, it may have been low budget but it was generally well reviewed
13so... a little under a third of the way into the movie and we finally have a stor?
they did have a point though
01,11So, yeah, the past half hour was A COMPLETE WASTE OF F**KING TIME!
They sleeping together?
it wasnt a complete waste of time

re-occuring theme with this driver. he will offer the right questions to give the right self reflection that ends up helping the whole production in the end.
But then I noticed that your cab driver is a worse actor than you
nope, I can't take it anymore. I'm really tired so I'm going to bed. Night guys

01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Director Tom DiCillo didn't want to beg people for money to make this film, so he asked his actors if they would work for free. All of them agreed and most of them even put up money themselves. Eventually anybody who contributed a few dollars got a part in the movie.

He's so fabulous.
05,15I really liked him in Reservoir Dogs
Thats very nice of the actors
I missed this movie last night and it caused fairly positive reaction so I figured I'd catch it now.

01,11To be quite frank, I fucking hate Chad. It's a good thing for actors to get involved in how their characters act and behave for a scene, but when you do it to the point where you're fucking up the production, you need to be slapped.

I need fasion advice, plz.

I got Dark Blue Jeans, a white button front shirt, a tweed jacket and black shoes.
Is this a good combination, or am I mad?
Your mad
:)
0,5What is drawfriend anyhow?
You're
Stupid grammar
05,15*
It's a picture post.
0,5I've seen it a million freakin times and I never asked about it
Just a stack of nice art that they've been posted over however long.
0,5And it's called "drawfriend"?
I am shamed to be called British with this bad grammar
<.<
0,5I see
so. can someone tell me, are we using the A movie>7.5 imdb rating, and Bmovie<7.5 already?
05,15no
then how is kung fu hustle A movie
01,11...
it had a 20 mil budget
01,11*slaps* No. YOu do it as told.
Wrek's stuff has been on several of them.
05,15Besides, we use Rotten Tomatoes
You egocentric bastard
i thought dari said imdb
xD
I've had a couple up as well :p
Does the budget still have to be in dollars to qualify as A?
kung fu hustle is a cult movie though
This movie had a shoestring budget, just $500,000
even freddiew said so
I haven't actually looked at the drawfriend in ages, I only hear if someone's on one from chat reaction.
xD
So I'm guessing that the movies and episodes have been chosen?
If freediew said so it gotta be true ?
yep
:p
what is big for a movie budget?
MaxTheBrony: no its just that its a famous cult movie
05,15It made a lot of money, and it has a really high critical reception
I always look at the drawfriend when i see the post :P
13that was well played
13well played
Silverscreen: Does Monroe get second dates?
Bam!
I swear you guys were using IMDB for ratings for quite a while.
01,11Randomnerd: If his girlfriend is any indication, then yes.
what would be considered big for a movie budget?
Fluttercry: so we determine by how much money a movie made then? just trying to figure this out, i thought cult movies with low budget were B
05,15I haven't been to EQD in....9 or so months
Nooby (and yet another tf2) question here... but if you find a hat. Does that make your item drop count less that week?
shaun of the dead was a B movie with good reviews too
This'd be nice if he was actually trying to be friendly.
douchebag :s
01,11*slap* NO!
But as it stands it's like..."Heeeey, talk about me to me because I love hearing my name."
Silverscreen: Thank you, I'll give it a go.
13believe so
Fuuuuuuu
13only time drops don't count is when there's a special crate floating around or the pyromania stufff
Should just count as one off your weekly amount.
Special crate floating around?
05,15twilight_sprinkle it's a combination of gross, budget, and reception
13the official wiki usually notes when something is running on its own quote
13like the scorched crates or pyro stuff, or the fall crate i think
Oh, ok.
he couldnt find the eye patch :s
now hes no pirate :s
twilight_sprinkle: one of the evil dead movies has a 100% on rotten tomatoes and there both b movies, weird
oh hi twilight_sprinkle. what's up?
Rape
hey Eli , trying to figure out why kung fu hustle is an A movie
There were no reviews listed for my choice of B Movie. But it WAS listed on IMDB and got a very low score. Rottentomatoes does feature an audience rating, and my B Movie has a very high rating.
if you have a question on a movie, ask a mod or 3 :)
I pretty much played all night while waiting for TOY, found "Head Warmer" first thing.... and only found 3 other items...
twilight_sprinkle: because it's funny?
superretroworld: yeah im confused...
haha
xD
Eli: a lot of B movies were good though
The speculated weekly drop is between 8 and 10
THERE's the eyepatch
Hey everpony!! :)
13so... we're halfway through...
05,15twilight_sprinkle B movies can be good
heya Ponyloverforever
LOL
XD
Hi, Ponyloverforever! :)
I want an eye patch
Fluttercry: i know, and kung fu hustle is a good movie with low budget, hence i thought itd be B
So we are halfway through this movie?
05,15Kung Fu Hustle had a high budget
twilight_sprinkle: what senes would it make to watch unfunny movies here?
20 mil is high?
Awesome B Movie: Rocky Horror Picture Show
Alright, thanks :P
Spongebob - am i a pretty girl?
05,15$20 million
So awesome, it's -still- being shown in movie theatres.
13best b ever: revenge of the nerds
twilight_sprinkle, you have to take into account WHEN it was made
05,15That was so much fun
20 mil is alot of money in us currentcy
EspyLacopa: and History Of The World!
13quit playing with her hair
EspyLacopa: i chosed that for b movie next week
twilight_sprinkle: of course the B movies are good too. we wouldn't want to watch bad movies, right?
Eli: i know that, im just trying to figure out the criteria
at least my picks were good
05,15RHPS isn't eligible, it was aired recently
also
Too much hair
HATE Chad xD
Chad kinda seems like a jerk
thats why I cross referenced my b movie with multiple sites, and asked a few mods
DerpyMuffins: Kind of? :D
i gtg to bed bye everypony!! :)
13whoops
twilight_sprinkle: there's none. they chose "movie to play first" called A. (usually the more popular one) and "movie to play second" called B
bye Ponyloverforever
13dat fake moon out the window
BYe, Ponyloverforever :)
Deeeeeeerp.
Bye :)
:p bye
short visit
Fake window
Eli: no there is a criteria
13uh oh
05,15Eli there is criteria
05,15based on budget, reception, and gross
Dat music cut
Scumbag Chad.
ok so 20 mil is high, i'll keep that in mind then
Fluttercry: pff whatever. make it complicated
His eyepatchi is on the eye he's using for the camera.
inb4 Chad's throat is slit
ego.
oh shit
13thought it was 7-12
13and i would always get like 3 at best....
05,15Eli it makes sure we don't get 1 good and one bad movie every week
im not really aware of the movie budget rates, so i didnt think 20mil is that much
:D
xD
haha
she is going to kick his ass
Also, I recognize those headphones. Sony
YEAH
I dunno if there's a canon on the drop rate, but it's always fuzzy.
13stop acting at me
ok, it's not that bad now
Quorl_Changeling, senheiser > sony
01,11pfft, Sony is shit. Seindheizer is where it's at.
05,15I love my Seinheiser headphones
05,15So awesome
ACTION
01,11and here's where the girl finally snaps on the asshole.
Sony is lower budget, thus perfect for this.
"Acting"
LOL
this is now a senheiser chat

Queen_Chrysalis: Hello my Queen.
Wtf is a twinkie?
xD
This movie has more F bombs than Beverly Hills Cop
Fluttercry: so, does shaolin soccer with 10mil budget and 50 mil gross, and 7.3 imdb qualify as B?
the food and hell
13suddenly a new character enters the picture
Queen_Chrysalis vs Chrysalis
hello

...FIGHT
mmm twinkies
also, Fluttercry there is nothing in the rules that state that your pony episode has to be G4 :)

...Roll camera.

PONY Good point. The budget's too low for security
^
13i'd film it
Fluttercry, I am not, I am just stating that even if you dont pick a g4 episode, technically, you are still following the rules as in the rules it is not stated that it has to be a G4 episode, but I will just drop it at that :0
sa,e
01,11GilDash|Away: TIMING~!
Silverscreen: Timing is everything! :D
oh look, it's GilDash
05,15Then please, by all means keep picking G1 episodes, we'll continue to throw them out
PONY: I know, right?
GilDash, omigosh omigosh omigosh
Did you include it in the fine print?
And now the movie is the movie of the movie.
01,11and it was a dream.

The Lannister, will kill you, they will kill you and you...
Misspellings everywhere
GilDash, how are ye?
They'll burn your house, they'll burn your wife, and your chicken too.
A Lannister always pays his debts.
PONY: Alive. That's well enough for now. XD
weird, the two mlp episodes next week are the first ones ive ever watched
When is next Season of Game of thrones by the way?
dat gigggle
01,11I'm annoyed by short people that get offended by every synonym for the word "small" in movies.
GilDash, I guess I say the sae
inb4 FIRE
Silverscreen, what about Edward Elric?
XD
dat doesnt count
that shit is just hilarious :)
Mr Dinklage is awesome.
right so Fluttercry , rating on RT for that 10 mil budget movie is 91% for critics and 82% for audeince
PONY: Yeah, I've been running around like a headless chicken for the past 5 hours.
05,15I'd say A
GilDash, running is good
Silverscreen: I'm getting a /little/ deja vu.
PONY: Not literal running... well, sometimes it was. :D
05,15but you should get a second opinion. I'm only one person
Can you guys give me some tips of good single player games :)?
GilDash, headless is fine
I m bored
Wandaful
hm ok Fluttercry , thanks
PONY: ... Okay. :S
Silverscreen: It's not their fault they're short tempered.
GilDash, but chcken?
what is considered big for a movie budget?

Scoot-Scootaloo: i'll give you a second opinion any day! but what about me ;_;
Silverscreen seems to put the smack down on punners.
MaxTheBrony: Next season of GoT is in March.
DoctoDoctorWho: Average modern hollywood budget is just a bit over 100 million USD
Hello!

Silverscreen: My point is, the same thing was said last night, about the offended Dwarfs.

Klumzeedragon: have you read my fic? its out now and Im working on ch2
Peter Dinklage is a handsome man.
Silverscreen: do you think shaolin soccer with 10 mil budget and a 91% critic rating and 82 audience rating counts as B or A
hi everypony :)
13dammit bob you have one job
Heya cachi01 !

Tito is a nickname meaning "Tiny", of course.
d3rb_: i want to vote for a different movie for A tho
hi alexxm :)
I am so hungry
Silverscreen: (notice that every time i say after effects, the pitch goes higher and higher everytime
now your just being greedy twilight_sprinkle :)
CrimsonPhoenix: its a good movie, although yeah, 91% might be too high, which is why i dont like rotten tomatoes
hi, cachi01 :)
PONY: You don't have any food? :S
Chat derp?
hi AJIsAwesome :)
01,11A laugh of insanity.
xD
Oh, nope. Just ded
d3rb_: :S
GilDash, I dunno
he calls that an insane laugh?
Klumzeedragon: Ill have it pumped out by the end of the week
01,11Shaoilin Soccer? Hmm, high budget, high return. What's the Rotten Tomatoes rating for it, though?
cachi01: WAIT A MINUTE, IT DOESN'T SAY PHONE ON YOUR NICK. :O
Deeeeeeaaaaaaad.
A lannister always hits his cues.
91%
Silverscreen: 91 critics, 82 audience
though I feel that movie to be very B
AJIsAwesome: yeah my dad gave me his laptop for 1 day. sadly its also a el shitbox
The Wrap is coming.
PONY: ... Why not go and find out? XD
cachi01: Ah, okay.
01,11Well hell, by those numbers it's an A movie. I almost want to see it now.
CrimsonPhoenix: me too. i thought kung fu hustle was B too, but its A
GilDash, too lazy
It takes 4 idiots to mess up a smoke machine?
what?
PONY: Then suffer hunger. :p
characters are horrible actors.
GilDash, naturally
05,15Obscure things also count as B
A it is then
AJIsAwesome: but in 1 month i will have my pc and i will be owning everyone in TF2 :)
01,11Old fassion smoke machines were a pain in the ass to work. Twice as complicated and three times as big.

PONY: Then suffer quietly. :D
F- old style dry ice smoke machines
cachi01: Hooray! I'm planning to get TF2 as well! :)
DoctoDoctorWho: Wewt! I'll be keeping my eye out for it.
Shaolin Soccer's been on TV. I wouldn't call it obscure... then again, so was my B movie
such a pain in the butt to work with
fashion*
01,11Dry ice is the best way to go for smoke, but it's a bit harder to come across.
Das where da oil go.
how are you cachi01?
Silverscreen, I was JUST about to bring that up myself
GilDash, it's one of my 1st world priviliges to be able to whine, or repeat the lines from 90's low budget movies...
Is she Pinkie now?
Silverscreen: I have lived places when dry ice can be found in grocery stores
"Why not both?" *fiesta*
So when does that thing blow up?
Didn't know there would be a problem, though
01,11Unnr|Laptop: cool.
see because she swalloed their old smoke machine, they have to use a new one which they dont know how to operate
01,11that's a lot of smoke.

All the smoke they'll ever need... and then some
Smokin'.

Dark92Enigma: im good :) btw did u watched the season finale? i was kinda dissapointed at how fluttershy said you are going to love me
I am not sure if dry ice is the best way to go, but you don´t get that nasty residue you tend to get with ¨fog juice¨
smoke smoke eryday

It's an old lady and the cab driver.
GilDash, I abuse the right until sues my and files a resriction order.

"Dad hit me first and knocked me down. It didn't hurt that much but... I started crying anyway, hoping he'd just leave me alone. Then he went over and started hitting Danny." "Ellen, I have no memory of this whatsoever." "Ma, you were just standing there looking at me. Then you pulled me up and said 'You're not hurt'....."/10
can't remember the accent

silverscreen, I am REALLY gonna miss you

Try and get your dial-up updated
01,11SILVERSCREEN'S REVIEW: I...don't know what to make of this movie. It seems like it's from another world. It's not engaging nore is it exciting for the most part, and yet it somehow keeps your interest. If you can sit through the boring aspects of it, you get a semi decent flick that's at least intruiging to watch, but I wouldn't call it something that's entertaining. 6/10.
Fluttercry: :O
13so... it was a dream.. within a dream... within a movie... about a dream... within a book.. within a movie
I'm not really sure what the purpose of that film.
13this movie makes INCEPTION make sense....
Shizuka: we struck in the psyche of a deranged person. SCIENCE!
Fluttercry I don't think there's an inception to describe that one
1hour 30minutes / 10
Shizuka: within a taco bell
Still, i think this movie was made by filmmakers fo filmmakers
PONY: so thats 90/10=10 then
*for
05,15But what you all don't realize is there never was a B movie at all. You just dreamt the whole thing
:O
13aaaaaaaaah
:0
youre all just a dream
Oh GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!
"I've always admired you from afar." "Admired? That sounds quite professional." Well love, how does that sound to you?" "That sounds like champaigne talking." "I've loved you from the moment we met." "Why haven't you told me?"/10
in fact its still friday morning
By the less-than-stellar review by you all, I guess its good I missed this weeks movie night
No, this was NOT a dream!
No John.... I am the dream!
13I CAN SEE FOREVER
/me wakes up
05,15and then John was a zombie

"I am so hungry." "Hahahahahaha"/10

05,15Okay! Well, I shall now go play games. It's been real y'all. Silverscreen, I hate to see you go, it was awesome having you around again.
And then we go RIGHT into an eisode that STARTS with a dream
01,11And oddly enough, we start the pony episode with a dream.
:O:O:O:O:O
Silverscreen: a freaky dream
IT HAPPENED AGAIN
WITH A DREAM
Silverscreen, I've notice
and then she freaks the hell out
ITS STILL A DREAM
noticed**
and then this
NIGHTMARE!
the hell
bye Fluttercry
13wait so is this still a dream?
taking a nap on a tree?
Bye, Fluttercry
GilDash: I think there was no purpose. Art for art's sake.
Shizuka: no she's awake now
bye Fluttercry
everything is a dream
Shizuka: XD
/me never existed in the first pla-*pop*
FiM never existed
brb
its alll a dream
A Dream in an episode, in a show, in a stream, in a dream, in a movie
Dreamturday
otakon: Trees are actually pretty comfortable.
FRAAAAAAAAAAAANCE
13I'M SO CONFUSED
this isnt real
what if bronies never existed, and all of this is just a weird dream! :O
FRIEEENDS
₧
Shizuka: your confussion isnt real
rdibp: nightmare
13aaaaaaaaah ><
Guys spoilers
its all a dream we are having while we have a dream
rdibp: Reality makes more sense
SirGanjalf: Perhaps. Not in the mood for abstract today, I guess.
Rainbow Dash dreamed the whole B movie
rdibp: then we will have to make that dream come true wont we?
rdibp: What if life is a dream?
LIFE IS A DREAM
/me spoils the episode
13GAH pinkie pie now i know this is a dream
dig dig de hole
good movie, 87%
01,11Gummy hat is best hat.
she secretly wish to become a movie director
This is the FIRST EPISODE i ever watched
Dark92Enigma: Shhh, they may not know this...
the memories
I kinda thought RD would have gotten a vulture
ok
is ifin a real word?
Dark92Enigma: A weird place to start if I do say so myself
Dark92Enigma: second episode for me, first was a friend in deed
I not lonely guys, not at all
13rainbow dash has summoned fluttershy
inb4 song
SONG TIME
01,11What AJisAwesome said. If you find the right collection of branches or the right strong branch, it can be a damn comfortable place to sleep. There is a tree in my town's old park that I loved to climb into and take a nape in.
and here
we
go
Fluttershy passive unleashed!
sing along!
awesome song incoming
fluttergasm
so adorable
/me nods head to the song
01,11otakon: you read my mind. fluttergasm. XD
here it is
I CANT WAIT TO GET STARTED
08,01i never climbed trees as a kid
Rainbow Dash has learned the spell: Summon Kindness Elemental
otakon: :S
Shizuka: I wish I could summon Fluttershy but I'm not high enough level.
cool cool beans beans beans
Awesome, cool, got it
08,01i phreaked phones instread
bullets? guns are canon
13i never climbed trees, i just... was..
08,01rdibp: canons are canon
08,01as are tanks
Silverscreen: til you fall off
08,01war is totally canon.
Silverscreen: in your sleep
I jumped from a short cliff once
dat tror
trot*
SHORT
ladybug
War is canon
Everfree NW stream is back up!
01,11The problem I have with this song is that it doesn't match Dash's character too well. It's been established in the songs in Season 1 that Dash fits a rock motif most, so a glamorous song like May Best Pet Win doesn't match her style.
13and then it wasn't a flying squirrel
13SPLAT
ROCKY THE FLYING SQUIRREL
You saw the Pegasus in the Heartswarming Eve play
:D
safas: you mean Canterlot Gardens
more like floating
sagas: crap, completely forgot about that
Silverscreen: She is letting Flutter take the lead
sagad*
sagas&
*
dem glasses
Silverscreen, I don't think of this song as a Rainbow Dash song though
MORDECAI!
Wasp is best pet :)
08,01Silverscreen: it's more G&S than glamorous
...
LE GASP
13they're both way too happy
01,11Really, The bat or falcon would match her best.
Shizuka: who?
13fluttershy doesn't do ecstatic
PONIES
I love that face
In before Derpy freakout
I personally thought RD would pick a Vulture as a pet
So other flzing creatures can stand on the clouds too... why did I miss that before?
:P:P:P:P:P
LET THE GAMES BEGIN
01,11DerpyMuffins: or how about a buzzard that would really buzz?
13and then derpy in the barn
That creepy face
AND MAY THE NEST PET WIN!
13now we know where derpy lives
08,01DERPYDERPYDERPYFERPY
MAY the games begin?
BEST*
DERPY!!!!!
Bat fits best, but really when I saw this the first time, I already knew who she would pick
08,01OMFGDERPY
08,01*ahem*
She lives with the Scootaloo's
now these games will determine...
13SHOW ME A REAL WAR FACE
08,01Unnr|Laptop: aye; it wouldn't work if it wasn't a duet
rdibp: dAMMMIT.....:D I NEVER get it right
/me steps up game
so why isn't this been engied
08,01but i still think it works as it is
08,01maybe i just love the song
What about Winter Wrap Up wen it comes to RD
Dark92Enigma: wat?
08,01so i don't really care
dem plots
Step up me game? But I don't see any stairs to step on. :(
daaaaaaaaaaawwww
rdibp: i never get the lyrics right
D'awwwwwwwwww
08,01AJIsAwesome|Busy: you should have seen us when Derpy talked
YAY Tortoise!
Seems to be a touch too much hype for Derpy/Ditzy, just because we basically made her doesn't make her good
Paspie: yeah but that doesn't make her bad either
Dark92Enigma: i just pointed out that fluttershy said MAY instead of LET
13>this isn't a game
13>now these games
/me this isn't a GAME, You know..........ok these GAMES <---------- CONTRADICTIVE MUCH!??
lol
:O
I love that linie
Shizuka: same thought
11,01Try.
Paspie, technically 4chan made her, You guys gave her popularity
XD
Rainbow fire?
actually I just LOVE this ep
swag
dat tron
MAGIC DUCK
Guys
13rainbow sparkle is best pet relationship
I'm not too much bothered about her not being in the series
When I was watching
Shizuka: ....
quack
rdibp: yes, but i said NEST instead of BEST also
GO
And she slid backward
01,11quack
forever alone
GOTTA GI FAST
GO*
Ah, the majestic Space Duck
what about last night
08,01i want a pet rainbow dash
I meant as a community, not personally
08,01like in my little dashie
13really the falcon is the best match for rainbow dash
and then
I saw the duck in front of dash for 1 frame
satun and AJIsAwesome|Busy : IIRC there is still a youtube video that has a capture of the stream when derpy talked
fried owl
RD is just so picky
Animators, I am dissapoint
Unnr|Laptop: I know. I saw that.
00,03Everyone wants a filly dash pet :'(
Unnr|Laptop: I saw that too!
D:
tank's radical test!
eenope
Unnr|Laptop: Just wish I was here in the actual chat.

But then all you would have seen is *Warning Incomming Spam*
So Tank has 1 Agility?
heh ok Dark92Enigma
*squee*
man she is HARSH
01,11MONARCH uses HYPNOSIS!
My favourites are Twilight for her over-thought attitude and Applejack for his under-thought imperfections
BUTTERFREE USED CONFUSE!
11,01Not really sure that part was necessary.
01,11IT'S SUPER EFFECTIVE
inb4 Hypnobutterfly
more like Butterfree
IT'S -----what Silverscreen
said
*her for Applejack

08,01oh oh! i might be going to the International Toy Fair in Nurnburg in January!

08,01currently trying to sort press tickets

OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH
08,01rdibp: it's spelled DRADIS

Nittany_Discord: That's funny, because I've only watched through halfway of season 2 onwards. XD
How far behind is steam for you guys?

Quarray Eels
You could just fly over them. :S

Dark92Enigma, and I think Ren and Stimpy
08,01SEPHIROTH!

AJIsAwesome: the competition is to FLY THROUGH not OVER Ghastly Gorge
01,11NOW cue the game over music.
13see
otakon: Oh, yeah. :$
inb4 127 hours
13falcon could fly away with that no problem
Hi Everypony
CrimsonPhoenix: i watched that episode with the overture in it
Hi, BroPony|MEDIC :)
08,01otakon: i've never actually played any of the FF gmes
hiya BroPony|MEDIC whazzup?
the only solution is to cut your wing!
GilDash yeah, thing is, the money from this jobs going into my spend at BUCK fund
Have to cut off that feather RD
so can't really lose it
FOREVAH
11,01It's only on a feather.
FOREEEEEEEEEEEEVEEEEEEEEEEEEEER!
08,01but when i was at music school, one of my friends had worked out how to play all the music form FF7 on the piano by ear
FOReEeEVER!!
otakon: There was a MLP MARATHON!
NO NO NO
or FF4
:'(
Now RD you won't be stuck there forever
D'awwwwwwwwwwww
that's only a feather
Just until you starve
forever = forever
PONY: it's a section of her wing
4ever
Chrysalis: That money from my job is going fricken' everywhere. Hopefully I can spend it on BUCK too. XD
01,11Okay, Dash, you have SIX FRIENDS who know you're supposed to come out of there within the hour. Of COURSE somepony would EVENTUALLY come looking for you.
james franco = rainbow dash
Tortise!!!!!!!
never ever ever ever ever
BESTEST TORTOISE EVER!
otan skinwings
DOOOOOOOOOOOMED! GAME OVER MAN, GAME OVER
Silverscreen: 6 friends? Don't you mean 5
SUPER STRENGTH GO!
now THAT'S Loyalty
I HAVE THE POWEEEEERRRR!
GilDash hopefully, also, i really hope theres another PPP at the next buck
01,11mitamaking: You're forgetting Spike.
mitamaking spike i guess
O_O
Silverscreen: six friends.........OH SPIKE, of course
Chrysalis: Rumour are there will be, and it'll be even bigger. ^_^
I think Ghastly Gorge is fairly dangerous on foot
ABBALANCHE!
i literally watched this episode 3 hours ago...
TORTOISE
If we count Spike, shouldn't we count the other pets? :p
13see
GilDash my mind cannot handle the omg
gotta go fast!
11,01Spike saw a rainbow.
TWO HOURS LATER
13they even cheat to make the tortoise win
That's...
13falcon should have been the winner
the cutest shot
of Rianbow Dash
Shizuka: enope
Chrysalis: I know, right? Easily the best party I've ever been to. :D
13this episode is bs
thank goodness you;re not hurt rainbow. RD: are you f***ing kidding me
Shizuka: why do youwant the falcon to win so bad?
Im with a friend who's not a brony, i need help
Falcon, etc. abandoned RD, Tutoise didn't
How? All the other pets crossed the finish line before. :S
rdibp: cause falcons ftw
rdibp: she's just a bit scuffed up
/me agrees with Shizuka
11,01Not hurt, but she's wearing a brace anyway.
AJIsAwesome: it was WITH her not ahead of her
GilDash easily
13cause the falcon won every other challenge
Trixie = Marcus Pheonix
Shizuka: no he didn't
Shizuka, the turtle came in last
Shizuka: Agreed, Team Falcon!~
Shizuka: Ponyville Canfidential was worse
Now I feel bad for the falcon
13the tortoise failed every event and had to cheat to cross the line
Should we sing about it again?
otakon: I was talking about Shizu's explanation.
13see
yay?
I just like falcons, so I'm going to go with the falcon anyway. XD
Spike = Bubbles
13and then rainbow dash pulls a technicality
Shizuka: The tortoise actually came last
01,11Shizuka's kinda right. Espeically seeing that Tank shouldn't have even been competing.
yay?
13and totally dumps the falcon
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAY?
BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURN
What a honour...
D'awwwwwwwwwwww
13and the last we ever see of the falcon is depression
Rarity = Bender
Does anypony else wonder how tank is able to be taken care of by rainbow dash?
Ponyville Confidential was worse than this one
Shizuka: Look, we are learning a lesson, don't get mad, if the falcon was not an a** he would have won easy
dat creepy smile
and letter
Meh. I still love this episode regardless.
and Tank was never seen again >_>
has anbyone here seen "who's line"
l like this episode too
i kilt him
and then rainbow dash had turtle soup
alexxm: NO. :D
13TAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANK
13set it on fire
alexxm lolwut
pony_4726: That´s cause RD took tank up to her home, the attachment ran out of fuel and he fell down somewhere onto equestrian soil
TANK
Shizuka: the eagle won one, the hummingbird another and so on
13too late fluttershy she already banished the falcon
01,11"Never give up, can do attitude" You mean like every other pet had just GOING THROUGH THAT FUCKING GORGE?!
13^
dat propellor with goggles!
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES
^
so tank represents dashs loyalty, does opal represent rarity being a bitch?
Flying Tank
It's a shame I only saw this episode once
Silverscreen: yeah but Tank showed it from the beginning of the competition
0,5aegkasng;lhsakdg
d3rb_: yep
Most eloquent.
Silverscreen: consistency, what's that?
I wanna watch Gravity Falls with you guys :D
FRIEEEEEEEEEEENDSSSS
no thats just cats in general
01,11otakon: only because Dash kept pushing it on him.
and then we never saw Tank again
anyway I'm gonna leave in about 30 minutes
did somepony say gravity falls :$
Silverscreen: yeah to leave and he stuck with it despite that
Me
gravity falls is best disney show
Shizuka: thanks for the stream
cachi01: it's a good one at least

Spike = Commander Sheperd
>Gravity Falls best Disney show
Godzilla was in the Time Travelers Pig
01,11otakon: again, because Dash kept pushing him away. She didn't give that "test" to anyone else.
:O:O:O:O:O
Shizuka steaming?
