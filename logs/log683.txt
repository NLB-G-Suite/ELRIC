yea, easy mode is pretty pathetic
Hi
Spagetthi all around
Knuckle's story takes place after Sonic's adventure right?
http://my.deviantart.com/messages/#/d5haav4
Ask Sega
because he's a genius and needs the extra amount of power? iunno
And the Special Stages are not much of an challenge...
Break dancing eggman!
lol
SpadeMagnes wut .-.
Not kididng
seeya cy--oh
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6h0dcudMAA :D
cameos
SpadeMagnes cause froggy
...And who's idea was to make Rouge's concept in the first place...?
FROOOOGGYYYYY
chrono trigger is very much win
Where are you Froggy
FROGGY! D:
No
Not at all
he.....uh.....found froggy
Because... reasons?
Cause froggy needs to be saved
Which is...retarded
Alls well that ends well
....but the city is bucking destroyed.....
Froggy!
By fishing for him!
Lots... and lots... of fishing
Why does tails seem shoehorned into SA2?
hey
I think the fact that they made Tails the "mech pilot" character was stupid.
Also SA2 marks the people of sonic's world having poor eyesight problems
Also, TEAMWORK FTW?!
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1349540958759.gif
They appeared in SA2
Great gif
its called they gave up
Three types of gameplay two set of stage each
I hated rogue stages
They were fakin impossible
hey guys
good evening
how are ya?
i want to tear my eyes out from the sockets and shit in them
friggin End of Evengelion
Ok guys now lets talk about that one thing we all spend atleast 4 years of our lives in it.........chao garden
*air
ok
People compare the werehog to GoW too much
Werehog was actually cool
I admit I was a bit annoyed at first
Wii version was shit though...
O_o you guys are still talking about sonix?
sonic*
I'm mostly "meh" about the werehog, but the daytime levels were lots of fun. =)
WII version is always shit
^
Fuck that button mash!
I beat it within the first day, it was too easy
*noms
:)
how you been?
curse you typos
I own the PS3 version
Yeah, they removed that level in the Wii version...don't know why, but...o..kay then.
That was annoying as fuck
dang net connection
Oh what's that? You passed the other levels but didn't collect enough medals?
I really liked that one, though I wish there was more content
TOO BAD
At least you can just find them lying around
Unlike the wii which requires speed
SpadeMagnes amen
^
DRILL!
LASER!
RRRRROCKET!
maybe now I'll be more patient
BURST!
VanHur: Yes, I really liked Generations. Again, I wish there was more content to it.
Yes
Apperently
>not listening to Acid Remix of Can you feel the sunshine http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrplxzlM8MY
ISHYGGIDY
yeah everyone hates on disk DLC
Oh yeah, that level, brilliant...
If you like pinball, that is. :P
that's it
I like it
pre order bonus
it's not a Pinball level
it's just a minigame
Yeah now we have to wait for zelda and metroid.DLC on the Wii U
Of course I would've prefered a full Casino Night Zone level, but the pinball's fun too
:,/
I mean sure there was one before but now?
http://youtu.be/Xx-yryFIB6E
NO
MY PAST
Don't come back to me
I flee you for a reason
/me starts humming reach for the stars
I really liked the remixed Casino Night Zone music for that /MINI GAME/.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcCrHZAKfPI
EMBRACE IT
No one remembers Nights anymore
SpadeMagnes night was bsd
Nights*
Bad*
I never played Nights. =P
UNLIMITED COLORS!
NiGHTS wasn't bad
maybe the sequel is
I want a dreamcast....
i saw an advert for it in a comic but i didn't play it
I have it
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ3HoxaaL8
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXHw8o6UI9M
/me doesnt care
if yes where do you live
Is it Hydro City or Hydrocity?
I believe it's Hydro City
yeah
No stream?
oh, billy hatcher, never played that gmae
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dHo_3NRRmY&feature=youtube_gdata_player >_>
i like the Casino Night zone...mainly cause of the music lol
Would of been freaking hillarious if the suit made him becamed a real chicken...Oh god...I just gave away a fanfic idea to the furries...
That
I don't know something about that got in me
Also apperently you can spin dash under the egg robo when it leaps up
Oh well...wonder if they'll made a sequel to Billy Hatcher...really underrated...
It felt special in a way and how it fit the large view of the level at the start
I dont think.so
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODKaVpMYZfg&feature=related Needs more Crysis City
*Crisis

13ikr
Because I'm not immature when it comes to names.
it is in the radme
I named my rival "Dickfak"
yup
13walkman
13this series is aaaancient
Asshat
That could work
My Rival was always named Him Blue or whatever his corrisponding version was
I'm glad it works
McDouche
ok
in the *exe directory
Name him Smogon
oooooooouuuuuuhh.... twirly
okay
13i like RDA's huh face

13richard dean anderson
13oneill
oh him
Does the shoot buttom work?
like once every 5 years?
yes
Afternoon everyone :)
also
at least on my computer :D
they reuse this principle in 6 seasons
13earlier than that
I might use Oshawott this time. I used Snivy last time.
it should be 6 on numpad
13they use it twice
It's not working on mine :p
13first to blow up a sun
they use it twice for the supergates
ouch, do you have numlock on?
13oh yeah they do get a third one
ok there we go haha
it works
:D
Oh yeah, catch a magnamite before the second gym in the city. I literally took the gym with a magnamite that was a much lower lvel than the gym.
it is stupidly expensive for them to do the gate effect wasnt it though
I should name my ditto prostitute.
which is why they only go through once an ep
LOL
13and also why it's aaaalways stock footage :3
nothings quite as awesome as the supergate openings though
13^
aww how many eps been showed?
which time
when they blow up a hive ship
YAAAAAAAA MY AZURILL EVEOLVED@@@
well

13nope i remember it

13crosses over with atlantis even
yeah cause mckay get threatened
numbers
ok
13:3
Yup everything seems to be working fine
pause menu too?
mckay is best atlantis character
13any ep that takes mckay down a peg is awesome :3
that was cool
Is there a button to select something
and beats carter's sun explosion
g2g for now guys...see yall later tonight ^_^
13you blow up one sun...
*goauld
whoops. weong ping
actually rewatched that ep fairly recently
bought the full boxset
s1-s10 and the film :D
yup, menus working fine too
ok
I really like this show o:
Most people think of time as a strict progression of cause to effect.
When actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint
I used to watch if on sc fi channel
pls.

13i just died for you
Alright. Online or offline?

Yep.
more like our entertainment
I don't even verb.
Wut?
i forgot i made tea
and it was sitting on my nightstand
and now its cold :(
13yes it sucks
NO!
THe COLD IS AWESOME!
Cold tea is bleeeeegh
i dont DO cold
13one environment
the cold :(
13sucks
13also i made this track
13it also sucks
i liek fog....just not cold
cold tea isn't good if you not intend it to be cold
i like the cold :3
coffee - not that bad
It's around 55 degrees. Loving every second of it.
I don;t lik cold tea. All I taste at that point is sugar.
13can't see anything capn ><
:3
heating up when youre cold > cooling off when youre hot
I just swalloed glass, on accident.. O_O
ouch
Ouch...
You should tell someone about that.
i think you should go to the hospital
dont move too much for the next hour
think you'll be fine or do you think you need to go somewhere for that?
youre fine
Like, right now.
unfortunatly
kk
it's hilarious
while you can bundle and warm yourself
Oh, PETA. You idiots.
You swallowed glass? why would you do that?
HOW would youdo that.
0,14for a moment there, that looked like a Delorean
Be my guest
Really wish PETA would try to stop doing these things. They're making themselves look worse than they need to be.
I just think they're hilarious really
I haven't heard anything from PETA nowadays
PETA doesn't get donations and attention by being moderate and trying to have workable solutions towards animal issues
they get money by doing crazy stupid things
You should chew on pens like a civilized person from now on
with KFC?
there's one problem though
Hah okay
I mean, sure there's no animal abuse in the sh- *remembers Twilight getting injured by a piano and other things by Derpy* On second thoughts, never mind.
whose excited?
ugh
13so yeah i made this track
PETA is evil
PETA IS EVIL
They euthanize them outright?
*.
They were caught euthanizing animals off the streets, yes
They take perfectly adoptable pets
and euthanize them
Wow.
I think I remember that on one recent occassion, I actually agreed with PETA on something. I don't remember the details, but I think it involved ACTUAL animal abuse.
Charrrrrrrilllllleeeee
meh. There are a lot of dogs and cats. They arn't going to go extinct and as long as they're not torturing them then whatever.
0,14I need it
360
People only care about dogs and cats because they look cute. At the end of the day they're animals. And animal shelters euthanize a lot of animals every day
chaaaaa ,/)_(\
oh cool ill ad you then
The Delorean mk ii? (Mark Two)
I volunteered at a animal shelter actually. They had a crematorium and beleive me, I saw piles of euthanized dogs and cats. Perhaps not the best thing for a 12 year old to see but whatev
*week
13this one i also made
it has no amp penalty right?
Dogs & Cats are just kept around for emergency food when things get bad - Have you learned nothing from Excel Saga?
thats how it was in the 40s anyway
er 30s
regions specificly
Yup.
ahh
Only cute animals deserve to live
no
just no
Track mania I take it?
CHOCOLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATE
That CHOCOLATE scream is Shizuka's horn, right?
I didn't know fish can survive on land craving for sweets
I cant read that tiny assed font in the corner :p

Nice horn.
I read the banner
Or is it chocolate?
I'm gonna have to revert my ping if I'm gonna do my Pony Fast

Can you use a x360 or steering wheel?
:'(
13but controllers cost as much as a decent keyboard
I just assumed that you use a controller.
13and have about a hundred less buttons and usefulness
13i hate controllers
13this i also made
workes good for halo ce
I can't do movement on the keyboard
there is no give
I'll probably fast on gaming once the IGG Marathon is done.

BULLSH*t
Did they shoot you an e-mail?

And that movie was highlighted?
No, I said "that", not "what"
Was it?
apparently because a year is too recent
it's been on DVD for 10 months
its not recent at all
Is there a dinosaur in the chatroom?
yes

I need to go forage some breakfast. brb
Peta's dream world would in fact be equestria, no one dies, Animals are the rulers, NO ONE eats meat (except for maybe the occaasional carnivore)
no, being a carnivore is wrong
I eat meat...
well there was that one time fluttershy fed fish to some otters or something :)
cotton*
same here, I have fangs for a reason, it is not to tear apart lettuce leaves :)
That was abit eh
Plain
I hope PETA realizes raising pets can be animal abuse.
The word "carnivore" implies you eat nothing but meat and cannot digest plant material.
it's possible to not eat meat and survive, why don't you do it?
Humans are omnivores.
^
Yeah, we can choose to eat just vegetables. That's called being a vegetarian, not an herbivore.
Being an herbivore means you physically cannot digest meat
Yep, we're still omnivores
Yeah
The last Vegitarian I saw was stupid and din't believe in evolution and belived the wprld was less than 10,000 years old.
But it's still possible to eat meat.
let me ask this
:<
._.
Some vegetarians don't like eggs AND milk. .-.
oh
Too
you monster :O
:3
Vegans go completely all out and don't even eat animal byproducts
G'day all.
And baby back ribs...
I was joking
Do periods have babies?
sorry dude i have to go
later
They burn.
and now you know
well, a period isn't an embryo as well
:)
okay let me ask this
Colors for mods are like canterlocks for luna
COLOURS! EVERYBODYN RURURURURURUN
Spell_of_Gaming: In order for the egg to have a baby inside, the egg would have to first be fertilized.
Spell_of_Gaming: Generally, chickens that are farmed for eggs never see any roosters.
This topic..;_;
but it
's a problem for vegans*
Spell_of_Gaming: No rooster means no fertilized egg. Ergo, no baby.
is peta against wolves, lions, tigers, coyote, or bobcats, Eagles or Hawks, as thier entire diet constitutes eating other animals? :)
you said meat though, not animal products ;-)
hello salmonela :)
it's not that difficult, I looked that up for my gf once
without suplements/vitamins?
^
No Rw CHocken Eggs
Genius.
And fish
Oh...
Ew.
for example, beans, oats, spinach, walnuts etc
I don't even WATCH any of the shows he's in. I only know him by reputation. :P
Tsk tsk
i think that worked
O hey, a stream! :D

She may have gone a LITTLE overboard with taunting the crowd, but she is just being herself!
Rofl
Basically, it's RD's boasting gone all wrong
She oozes arrogance.
^
:)
Yeah
None
I know there is a good pony behind all those fireworks and ego boosts, I can see it.
I dont have anything agaisnt trixie per se
she is a showmare, her JOB is to exagerate
no spoilers
If Trixie's character is improved in her next appearance, then that's cool. But from everything I saw in the one episode she appeared in. She's just an arrogant bitch.
osnap.
This argument is getting a little overboard...
Ok, gotta cook some pasta, be back later :P
