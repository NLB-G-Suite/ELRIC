I don't like playing Sonic 3 by itself, cuz it's only half the game.
Sonic and Knuckles, Eh, it's still great, nothing to say about it...
the last good sonic game was Adventure 2 battle
yea, easy mode is pretty pathetic
Hi
Hey sonic colors was good
Spagetthi all around
So was generations
Easy mode is always pathetic Dken2021
Sonic and Knuckles isn't meant to be played by itself.
Because it's the second half of Sonic 3
Knuckle's story takes place after Sonic's adventure right?
Sonic 3 and Knuckles, Behold, THE greatest Sonic game out there, It's the first and only to feature...SEIZURE SONI-I mean...Hyper Sonic!
Sonic 4 was meh
LOL, yes. AND Super Tails
And Super Tails...and Hyper Knuckles...
Sonic 4's website said they happened at the same time..some how
Don't forget Super Tails and his FLICKY ARMY OF DEATH!!!
SCREW SUPER TAILS
So why does tails need the super emeralds to go super?
Ask Sega
Sonic 3D Blast: Eh...it's...OKAY...but the over the head view kind of ruined it...
because he's a genius and needs the extra amount of power? iunno
Inexperience with the chaos emerald energy?
And the Special Stages are not much of an challenge...
i prefer super mario bros 3...
Super mario bros 3 is so fucking awesome
Unlike Sonic 3's special stages...
Mario 3 was awesome too
Break dancing eggman!
mmmm i think i will play some super mario bros 3 on my nes
Am I the only person here who loves Sonic and Mario equally?
Sonic Adventure, it's...still good...but it haven't aged well for me.
for those who don't know what SpadeMagnes[School] is talking about http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJVabLZl3kw
Sonic Adventure ruled
Who was Eggman in SA 1?
Could of been better...if it haven't been for Big The Cat...
Gold_Demona i used to loved them equal. But then my love for sonic was kinda going down
*sniff* ...Gamma...
VenHur: Aka Duke Nukem
if you take Big away
But i have a sonic plushie =D
And i love it
I still find it hilarious Big the cat was voiced by Duke Nukem...
lol
Im gonna get some sleep - might be back later...if im well enough
SpadeMagnes wut .-.
Not kididng
seeya cy--oh
Sonic Adventure 2, the story's fantasic, the levels were great (expect for Knuckles and Rouge's, they're kind of a pain..), and the music's awesome.
Also why IS big in the game?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6h0dcudMAA :D
cameos
SpadeMagnes cause froggy
I like how Big the Cat was an easter egg in SA2
...And who's idea was to make Rouge's concept in the first place...?
Sonic Youtube poop2008
FROOOOGGYYYYY
VenHur: some very sexualy deprived man
chrono trigger is very much win
Bronysith: No argument there.
Where are you Froggy
VenHur Cause fanservice ftw?
FROGGY! D:
VenHur it was around the time sonic team though sonic needed to be edgy and have a story
Press X to Froggy
Chrono trigger is pretty much my fav game, too goddamn good
Does Big contribute ANYTHING to the plot?
No
nope
So why is he there?
Not at all
Nope
SpadeMagnes[School]: havent you ever heard of shoehorned in characters?
he.....uh.....found froggy
Because... reasons?
Cause froggy needs to be saved
They apperently made Big because they didnt want a character that went fast all the time
Who else was gonna save Froggy? D:
who....had swallowed an emerald for no reason.....
Which is...retarded
Alls well that ends well
Gotta save froggy
....but the city is bucking destroyed.....
Froggy!
Save Froggy! D:<
By fishing for him!
Lots... and lots... of fishing
Why does tails seem shoehorned into SA2?
What characters were in the origional SA2?
hey
I think the fact that they made Tails the "mech pilot" character was stupid.
why so many questions? :D
Sonic Heroes, I think this is where the Dark Age of Sonic began, sure the game's great and all, but Sonic and his friends just won't shut up!
Also SA2 marks the people of sonic's world having poor eyesight problems
Also, TEAMWORK FTW?!
In the original SA2, it was Sonic, Knuckles, Tails, Big, and E102 Gamma. I think.
SpadeMagnes well the robot. Shadow, Rogue,sonic,tails,knuckles,amy and cream
Oh and Amy
Shadow and Rouge weren't in the first one
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1349540958759.gif
They appeared in SA2
Great gif
Well who was playable in SA2?
Shadow The Hedgehog, seriously...Shadow with a motorcycle...and guns? The hell SEGA?
its called they gave up
Sonic Shadow, Rouge Knuckle, Tails Eggman
SpadeMagnes. Playable? Sonic tails knuckles shadow the robot and rogue
they realized sonic was dead
so they try anything
CrimsonPhoenix hehe
Three types of gameplay two set of stage each
VenHur atleast the story was good.....
cachi01|phone: nope
Sonic 06, ...NEVER. BUY. THIS. GAME.
lovely gif :D
I hated rogue stages
VenHur, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MWEHwvcnyM
VenHur: LOL Watching a Let's Play of it was enough for me
They were fakin impossible
the concept for shadow was good.....but playing levels again and to find out there's just one good ending? blech
hey guys
hey alexxm
Hi alexxm :)
Hiyo alexxm
good evening
how are ya?
i want to tear my eyes out from the sockets and shit in them
friggin End of Evengelion
how are things Dken2021 cachi01|phone and Gold_Demona
I fucking love I am all of me
Wow, extreme much Bronysith?
Ok guys now lets talk about that one thing we all spend atleast 4 years of our lives in it.........chao garden
Goin' good, alexxm
Sonic Unleashed, what a breath of fresh it would of been better without the Werehog gimmick, but I don't mind...
Gold_Demona: you try dealing with this depressive anime
things are swell Alchemist
*air
Bronysith: I have. A couple of times
er.. alexxm
ok
People compare the werehog to GoW too much
Chao garden is best garden
and ninja gaiden
mmhmm, my cousins loved the chao garden
Werehog was actually cool
I loved chao garden
I admit I was a bit annoyed at first
CUBE!
but once you unlock every move it's a blast
Wii version was shit though...
O_o you guys are still talking about sonix?
sonic*
I'm mostly "meh" about the werehog, but the daytime levels were lots of fun. =)
WII version is always shit
^
Though Unleashed can't argue with his final boss
Oh GOD that final boss
twilight_sprinkle SPRINKLE!
I've never finished sonic unleashed. I.got bored so i havent played it in a year
Fuck that button mash!
FUCK IT TO HELL
I beat it within the first day, it was too easy
is there a stream for some reason my internet doesn't like showing streams
I've never made it to the final boss of Unleashed. I always lose interest somewhere along the way
Bad news though...I owned the Wii version...so I didn't know what the Africa themed level was like...
Panda: PANDAAA *nos&glomps*:3
*noms
:)
alexxm, there is no stream
how you been?
curse you typos
I own the PS3 version
Yeah, they removed that level in the Wii version...don't know why, but...o..kay then.
Why would anyone think pressing x 50 times was a good idea
Also another problem with unleashed was MEDAL COLLECT
Panda: eh ok i guess. tired atm. what about you?
That was annoying as fuck
Sonic 06 can go fuck itself
The only new Sonic game I've beaten is Sonic Generations.
dang net connection
Oh what's that? You passed the other levels but didn't collect enough medals?
I really liked that one, though I wish there was more content
I'm good, got some stuff done this morning :3 now im just drawing stuffs for a friend twilight_sprinkle
TOO BAD
I've pretty much beaten every sonic game
At least you can just find them lying around
I've never beaten sonic advance 2 :(
Unlike the wii which requires speed
Sonic Colors: This was Unleashed, but better thought out, I liked the Wisp gimmick too.
Panda: nice, the only thing i can draw is graphs :D
I loved sonic advance
Oh fuck the Sonic advanced 2 special stage
twilight_sprinkle D: I cant draw those! I fail so hard!
SpadeMagnes[School], the medal requirement was ridiculous at some point
The requirement is so bullshit
SpadeMagnes amen
Sadly, I've never played Sonic Colors. I've heard good things about it though.
I should play Sonic Colours
^
SpadeMagnes[School] the special stages were pretty easy, but yea, the requiremets to get there are stupid
I should GET Sonic Colors
sadly the game bored me at some point
DRILL!
Panda: heh, i remember drawing my math teachers face with graphs :D
LASER!
RRRRROCKET!
maybe now I'll be more patient
BURST!
And Finally, Sonic Generations, oh my god...this is where I gone back to playing Sonic, all those nostalgia, the remixed music...it's too BRILLIANT!
but seriously for those who haven't played 06 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MWEHwvcnyM
CYCLONE JOKER
Btw i remember there was this weird egg in sonic advance 2 in the chao garden.......what was it about?
VenHur, you bought the game for nostalgia?
VanHur: Yes, I really liked Generations. Again, I wish there was more content to it.
I'd love to see them add more worlds to it
why not buy every Sega Genesis collection out there
it's pretty much what Sega is good for these days
God forbid Sega does dlc
CrimsonPhoenix: Because the Genesis collection isn't remakes.
Seriously, I banged my head a lot while listening to the Super Sonic Racing theme. And Escape from the City too.
How long did it take for Unleashed to even get DlC?
Unleashed has DlC?
Yes
Apperently
A new country
I only have the PS2 version, so that's news to me.
>not listening to Acid Remix of Can you feel the sunshine http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrplxzlM8MY
ISHYGGIDY
The kind of dlc i dislike is the stuff thats allready on the disk
yeah everyone hates on disk DLC
Altough, I wished there's was DLC for that game...I heard about a pinball themed level for Sonic Generations.
VenHur escape from the city is awesome
Those Mario DLC were pretty alright in my opinion
VenHur: Yeah the Casino Night level
VenHur: I have it. It's fun
Oh yeah, that level, brilliant...
If you like pinball, that is. :P
That level is just a pinball mini game
that's it
I like it
pre order bonus
it's not a Pinball level
Can't wait for the next Sonic game, oh how will Eggman gets out of the whiteness...
it's just a minigame
Yeah now we have to wait for zelda and metroid.DLC on the Wii U
Of course I would've prefered a full Casino Night Zone level, but the pinball's fun too
:,/
VenHur, I don't think there's a continuity now
I mean sure there was one before but now?
They got a artbook a statue and other stuff
http://youtu.be/Xx-yryFIB6E
My god I think I'm falling in a Sonic mood now....
NO
MY PAST
Don't come back to me
I flee you for a reason
Also Sonic Colors has THE LONGEST credits ever....
/me starts humming reach for the stars
I really liked the remixed Casino Night Zone music for that /MINI GAME/.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcCrHZAKfPI
EMBRACE IT
It was always one of my favorite tracks from Sonic 2.
Rarity's theme song if she was in Sonic R http://youtu.be/zex_DZcEn4o
No one remembers Nights anymore
SpadeMagnes night was bsd
Nights*
Bad*
SpadeMagnes[School], I got the shitty sequel
I never played Nights. =P
The sequel sucks ass
how was nights bad from what i've seen it looks pretty decent
UNLIMITED COLORS!
I would LOVE to play the sequel and knowing Sega I guess it's just a matter of time until it gets on Steam
NiGHTS wasn't bad
maybe the sequel is
alexxm to be honest i only played the shitty sequel for wii
but the original was beautiful for its time
Does anyone remember Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg?
Nope
That game was cute, but kinda boring.
Gold_Demona, I know a person that does
I want a dreamcast....
i saw an advert for it in a comic but i didn't play it
Gold_Demona a friend of mine has that game
so many good games on it
I have it
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ3HoxaaL8
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXHw8o6UI9M
CrimsonPhoenix same here
I love Doomsday Zone
Fucking love the Project Chaos remix of it
/me completed sonic adventure DX 100%
/me doesnt care
CrimsonPhoenix my cousin had a dreamcast he had sonic adventure marvel vs capcom and a load of other games
Its so freaking easy
alexxm, does he still have it?
if yes where do you live
Is it Hydro City or Hydrocity?
CrimsonPhoenix i think he gave it to another cousin who couldn't afford any of this gens systems
I believe it's Hydro City
that's sweet
yeah
Oh, I have Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_181FnvwOg Needs more Lava Reef
No stream?
Great game and all...
pinkiepieguy nope
...BUT WHY IN GOD'S NAME DO I (or rather Billy himself...) HAVE TO WEAR A CHICKEN SUIT?!
Fucking love lava reef
VenHur to appease the furries
chicken suit?
VenHur: because the chicken suit is magic and gives Billy his chicken powers. :P
What I heard Labarynth zone was supposed to be after green hill
MLP is next on Hub
You telling me you don't wanna be Scootaloo?
oh, billy hatcher, never played that gmae
My most favorite song in Generation http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EdNeCCqYFw
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dHo_3NRRmY&feature=youtube_gdata_player >_>
Yes, I love Chemical Plant Zone. =D
just while playing Chemical Plant Zone while hearing this made me love it
I prefer the classic remix though
i like the Casino Night zone...mainly cause of the music lol
Gold_Demona, there's no BLUDUBULOOP
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySsrnlj6MfE Needs more Death Egg robo
Would of been freaking hillarious if the suit made him becamed a real chicken...Oh god...I just gave away a fanfic idea to the furries...
Yes, I love Casino Night's music
CrimsonPhoenix: LOL true
That
I don't know something about that got in me
it was like HOLY SHIT
Also apperently you can spin dash under the egg robo when it leaps up
Oh well...wonder if they'll made a sequel to Billy Hatcher...really underrated...
It felt special in a way and how it fit the large view of the level at the start
VenHur they wont
I dont think.so
and City Escape is overrated due to Nostalgia
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODKaVpMYZfg&feature=related Needs more Crysis City
that City Escape Nostalgia overload
*Crisis
also I think you can't beat the truck now in Generation
There's should be a mashup of the Classic, Modern, and original 06 versions of Crisis City...I would Eargasm...
http://youtu.be/hnUgeEGstDU Like this
VenHur: I have just what you want
The only way Billy Hatcher will ever appear again is if Sonic Team makes one of those "crossover compilation morass of characters" type of game. Like Super Smash Bros. or a racing game.
Which they'll never do
I agree City Escape is overrated, but I still love it. :3
SONIC VS BIG ASS TRUCK WHO WINS
Give me a minuete to find it
LMAO That truck glitch. XD
hello
oh hey BIg is in this video too
What truck glitch?
http://youtu.be/hnUgeEGstDU

Hi mentallyeffedguy :)

That glitch is pretty awesome
A HEDGEHOG intimidating A HUGE TRUCK
Hey ven you wanted a mash up?
VenHur: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_eX4QzvuMI Well here you go
Lol i need to try that glitch
I lol'ed at the top comments of the truck glitch video.
Enjoy the mash up you wanted
Damn you Omochao, YOU was the truck driver all along!

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_qGa4N2CY
I still say Live and Learn is the best final boss music
SpadeMagnes[School], His world has something to say
You know as horrible as Sonic 06 was
its soundtrack was still the most amazing thing
The music never falters
the game play however...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VHnFwVskl0
Oh god....

Omochao is worse than fucking navi

hey
yea
In my school max points is 100
i now watch GaoGaiGar
And we're not half way done with the course
When I went to school, your score was based on percent, not points. O_o
God I hate school...
btu school's fun :D
No it's not
If anybody had a little bit time, I need to test my Sparx game engine a little bit. Just if it works on other maschines than mine :D
School is social hell for introverts
I should be able to learn shit on my own pace
yeah sure
it's either school or the battle royale kid
Middle school can die in a fire
^
Besides I probably wont use half the crap I learn
^^^
true
I just need to know if there isn't any serious error in portability
Agreed Bronysith
those were the worst 3 years of my life
Hey all.
Mine too
okay
2 for me.
Hiyo Randomnerd
Bronysith: tell me about
Hi, Randomnerd. :)

alexxm: Yes, I have.
It was awesome.

must see that
I hope the download link works
And that's all I can say, really. Those who haven't seen it really should.
Randomnerd i saw it saturday any idea what would have summoned kevin
Maybe a pair of glasses?
I automatically assumed it was a reference to Sin City.
If you discover all objects shaking on one place let me know :D I had such bug once :D

yeah i guessed the film reel summon the werewolf the necklace summoned the bride and the music box summoned the toothy ballerina
hey guys
sup Moopy
hi Moopy
hi dude
Quick question, does anybodies computer flip out when you double click zip files?
good evening
Hi, Moopy. :)
heyy Moopy

SpadeMagnes[School: you could always clop

so whats going on today?
Wow! A whole piano? :O

Cloppity clop
hmmmmmm
/me puts a scorpion in SpadesMagne|School's mouth
sexy luna "gargle"
Youtube isn't working for me
why is that?
I lack a mouth
I think I read somewhere that it's only internet explorer that flips out
and you must scream?
luna is so sexy
Ghost_of_Dken2021: /)
Dark92Enigma: Did you try completely closing your browser and restarting it again? Cuz that's what I had to do.
Hey, have you guys seen this video?
well that means a scorpion crawling on your face SpadesMagnes|School
Gold_Demona: i'll do that......
I'm a little embarrassed to ask, but I worked on it, it's a puppet show :D
Bronysith /)
/me swats it off with his sword arm
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iolpKBgJ-Oc&feature=plcp
for example if you had IE set to automatically download files without asking, it may download and open it for you, and if you have zip associated with IE, it will download it again and then open it and so on, but this isn't propably the cause... just guessig
maybe
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UtuKeS6igE :D
What the crap.
Hey have you guys ever seen a vortex cannon befor?

SpadeMagnes[School: Victims of the hammer.

SpadeMagnes[School, she does stream TF2 some times, and IIRC, she likes to play Pyro for real.
i saw the lion. lion usually means interesting stuff
Rocks
Pyro is a fairly fun class.

Dark_Horst, the lion means it's from MGM
When did Tom's ancestors become space travelers?

but really there isn't much to do in the game.
Hey Bronysith.
Wow my parents laptop downloads it way faster then mine :o
STFU
Arcane, that's a good PC game where you can play god
/me liked FF13 and 13-2
No no no I play in Pokemon VGC if you know what that is o:
Oh Pokemon
Pocket monsters?
Ew
Jmo ^^
Thoguht you meant the PC game for a second.
Thought*
Well yeah it's in alpha haha
Star Gate?
Arcane, but Black and White 2 is a PC game
stargate
CrimsonPhoenix: hes talking about pokemon black and white 2
Pokemon Black and White 2 doesn't exist
I need to add butterflies and powerups...
I have to agree, milked too much.
CrimsonPhoenix Pokemon B/W2 <3
I know Pokemon Black 2 or Pokemon White 2
Die already ;_;

CrimsonPhoenix /)_=

Dark92Enigma: EUREKA!

Bronysith, I'm not stupid, I just don't assume
Oh boy you have problems.
Not going to buy B2/W2 for a while though
I'll implement respawn soon
Arcane they arent the same?
Then Arcane precise it

Hi everypony. and DashWithRainbows you can't name your rival anything dirty.
i want pokemon black 2
:(
Hi, Kawaii_icybeauti. :)
hey AJIsAwesome
Hi kawaii_icybeauti :)
13slow motion captain is best witness
My husband's gonna get Black 2, and I'm gonna get White 2
Hi Kawaii_icybeauti
Hi Shizuka :)
It's still a fun game. I'm enjoying it and thelonepony
I'm willing to have a quick battle with somepony before I leave o:
Kawaii_icybeauti My only rival is Gary.
oh and do you know the controlls?
Gold_Demona: Nice. :)
U shuld no dis
DashWithRainbows: You don't name your rival penis?
huh
i never noticed
Nope.
but the early power readouts
Kawaii_icybeauti: i need it, want it
look like ZPMs
13ikr
Because I'm not immature when it comes to names.
I will miss naming my opponent douchebag :'(
it is in the radme
cachi01|phone: Me too :'(
Spell it wrong.
I named my rival "Dickfak"
yup
cachi01|phone: I always just named him something normal. :D
13walkman
13this series is aaaancient
Asshat
That could work
Asshat fucking oak
I was so happy when I made my purchase on Amazon, cuz I had like 15 bucks worth of points on my credit card. And the games had free shipping. :D
My Rival was always named Him Blue or whatever his corrisponding version was
I always name my character bigdick or cachi :I
I'm glad it works
McDouche
cachi01|phone: You could name him that
Yay
Bigdick vs Douchebag is best fight
btw after closing the game there should be "stdout" file - check it if there are any errors
It's just the obvious "Penis" "Shit"...All of those.
ok
13everything's better with spinning
in the *exe directory
Name him Smogon
And i always name my first pokemon sex slave
oooooooouuuuuuhh.... twirly
Except in ponymon
Imma go try that.
nope, no errors
okay
Shizuka: spinning bird kick
13i like RDA's huh face
thanks :)
I name my DIttos SexSlave
13it's so cute
np
I got to nimbasa city, and when you go back to castella, there's a girl who ALWAYS fights you, even if you've beaten her.
who's rda again?
Arcane well....dittos are sexlaves
13richard dean anderson
13oneill
Pretty sure I'm gonna just use Katana for White 2
oh him
how often does a pokemon game come out again?
Does the shoot buttom work?
like once every 5 years?
I started with snivy this time around. I had a samarott already.
yes
no wonder i couldn remember a role with those initials xD
Every some number of years
Afternoon everyone :)
also
I always named my pokemon after the japanese names.
hell yes for continuity
Hi, soulrider95. :)
at least on my computer :D
they reuse this principle in 6 seasons
13earlier than that
I might use Oshawott this time. I used Snivy last time.
it should be 6 on numpad
13they use it twice
It's not working on mine :p
13first to blow up a sun
cachi01 I know hehe. I have a max IV shiny Ditto
they use it twice for the supergates
ouch, do you have numlock on?
Got me a new sound card :D
13oh yeah they do get a third one
ok there we go haha
it works
:D
Oh yeah, catch a magnamite before the second gym in the city. I literally took the gym with a magnamite that was a much lower lvel than the gym.
Arcane make it have a baby with a random pokemon lol
13close the iris! we blew our budget already making the event horizon swirly!
it is stupidly expensive for them to do the gate effect wasnt it though
I should name my ditto prostitute.
which is why they only go through once an ep
cachi01 I Used him to breed my entire team, so i could get MAX IVs on them all
LOL
13and also why it's aaaalways stock footage :3
nothings quite as awesome as the supergate openings though
13^
aww how many eps been showed?
So far, I named my pokemans viper,umi, and machinehed
13i should jump to the end of that ep just to show it
which time
when they blow up a hive ship
YAAAAAAAA MY AZURILL EVEOLVED@@@
well
they blow up a nuke
to blow up a hive ship
to trigger a gate jump, that blows up an ori ship
that was awesome
funny... i dont rember that
13which almost blows up tealc

must've msised the ep
Yes I beated it
wb thelonepony

that chick looks like hilary clinton
13nope i remember it
13the pegasus project, season 9
i remmber that they once blew up and then unblew-up themselves
13crosses over with atlantis even
yeah cause mckay get threatened
and just one quick question, do the gem counter show numbers or letters?
numbers
with a lemon
ok
13:3
Yup everything seems to be working fine
he works best under threat of iminant death
pause menu too?
mckay is best atlantis character
Is this about space? *has never seen the show*
carson gets points for the accent though
13any ep that takes mckay down a peg is awesome :3
Kawaii_icybeauti: these guys there are a
he does blow up a solar system
that was cool
Is there a button to select something
and beats carter's sun explosion
g2g for now guys...see yall later tonight ^_^
Kammerjunk: are airforce. they have found this nifty stargate. now they visit other planets via gate-network and fight guerilla style against goaluld
13you blow up one sun...
*goauld
<3 Shizuka
just to get onto other pages - w, s move up down and num 5 to select
whoops. weong ping

Dark_Horst: Ping.

ah ok
bought the full boxset
s1-s10 and the film :D
yup, menus working fine too
ok
Stallion_of_War: you forgot 'timey wimey'
I really like this show o:
Most people think of time as a strict progression of cause to effect.
I used to watch if on sc fi channel
great, now just to decide what to make now, maybe butterflies
It's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey.... stuff...
Fersure: Ahh, it is time, not causality,
do not question my knowledge of doctor who.
pls.
;D
Combustion man?
WIBBLY WOBBLY TIMEY WIMEY

I was going to do a pony, but I wanna save that for bronycon next year.
13yay blowing it up!
Just a crazy man with a blue box.
blowing stuff up alwas solves the problem. even still standing earth cores
Im going to cosplay as tom
Don't forget the sonic screwdriver
"I recognize that the council has made a decision, but given that it's a stupid-plot decision, I've chosen to ignore it."
Where is bronycon going to be next year?
I don't even know of any brony conventions in my country.
:/
Shizuka: that guys seems to be mad ad o'neill. why's that?
Fersure: Where it always is; medowlands conviention center, secaucus, new jersey,USA
13Dark_Horst: plot

Manchester is awesome.

13Stallion_of_War: that's general goddamn hammond you're bald fatting
as long as you dont get on the bus system
There's not many places they could have it any way.
Maybe Birmingham.
oh. old war buddy, eh?
whats use pony_1746
Chrysalis: When I'm in Manchester, I walk/use the trams.
?
The trams in Manc are soooo efficient.

Fersure: I know that feeling. :(
ekips: because stargate sucks
OH
ekips: Stargate is on teh stream
SNAP
SON
Shizuka: considering their budget, it sure is. hell, the "swoosh" effect when the gate opens was made via blowing pressurized air into water
I request Fersure to be kicked
Bombs - now using lampshades as bases
I request ekips change his/her nickname to mudkipz

Logic flew out the window.
When u come into the Bronystate playground
logic should be left at the entrance.
i didnt know the iris was gravity-proof
I'll kick down your sand castle.
k?
13it wasn't
kk
13it was withstanding the pull until now
not mine anyways
Who owns it?
Shizuka: looked like it at least dampened it though. that, or the wormhole picked the luckiest moment to kick another foot in
13well yeah, plot
so why is the gate pulling everything in?
HEY STARGATE! BITE MY SHINEY METAL BOMB!
13the iris is placed like a micrometer in front of the event horizon, normally prevents particles from forming
It's Dari's sand castle
Oh sweet
Tealc vs black hole
tealc wins
hes so bad ass
it's moments like those whenn you're happy you brought an alien mucle-dude home from your missions
he dampened the sand with the tears of other children
The bomb should have, ohh, time's slowing down
13and then they all died, the end
13it was aaaaaall a dream
The more of a reason to stomp it.
:>
Shizuka they never explain why the iris doesnt vaporise though
Cun cun The Start of day 1
Shizuka: and JJ was taking a shower
Thank you general Donut

Hey everypony!!!!!!!

Continue on.
Hi, QuinnThePegaSistta! :)
13my thinking is the iris was strong enough to withstand multiple Gs coming from the wormhole, and was holding up well until that last shard of glass/rope
blackhole, time dilation effect due to gravity
that, ekips
hows it going AJIsAwesome
13as for why gravity suddenly increased after the iris blew?

The question of the century

Shizuka: he probably explained the questiona after life, the universe and everything else
Shizuka: But I want to know. ;____;

Lucky--one of the greatest episodes ever.

Pootis: that is the abridged version of the short version of the short explanation
*you're a
Pootis, you should ask me that
i am his sex life :3
Pootis: to actually find out about stargate, i recommend wikipedia. too much to explain in here
13give me a moment, going to try something

How do you customise your text?
Grrr why is it lagging so much on my end :(
but it is a necessity
shizuka made fraser sad
13okay so it is kmplayer screwing up...
MadSurge stream is stopped atm
Pootis only mods get colours
I thought so..
The mods can sometimes make their text unreadable
Wherefore art though buffer

Lyra`: Whoops

I LOVE THIS EPISODE
balanced up
13problem isn't with the file cause it's centered in gomplayer
13i am confus
matt smith taught me well.
GTFO
13no this is downsample to mono, stereo is bugged somehow
13i'll troubleshoot more after this ep
love you too babe
Who is the egyptian with the gold on his forehead?
hes really not that bad an actor, he just suffers from lackluster writing.
what
In'deed?
that was
Matt Smith is best pony. :3
he barreled through him
like an ape chaing after banans
AJIsAwesome, david tennant will kick matt smiths ass
Lies, he's more wooden than Plank in Ed, Edd n Eddy.
Oh, THIS episode! Mom LOVES this episode
13plank is best actor
he is very purty!
Plank was a badass man
Shizuka: He should have been 11th Doctor
13yes
good year, that.
13and johnny would be his companion :3
XD
:D
ded deed and deddy, the darleks
I don't care what people say
Lyra`: Of course. I was kidding. :D
I still like the eleventh doctor
you people hate gangam style right?
Buytoast, who told you taht?
13dat doh
you can't really compare him to the tenth. he's a completely different doctor
Be back in a dec.
im just sad that this generation is going too ruin gangnam style :(
error
oh
error
it already has
it's like comparing Sean Connery to Daniel Craig
hold on
in the James Bond films
Long time no see everypony!
dat stock footage
*sec
http://i48.tinypic.com/2hzo0om.jpg
saw that on the train
13fun fact, the froot loops are glued to the spoon so that it's the same with every take
Who said I'm comparing him to 1th?
10th*
I just don't like him
Buytoast: want
damnit! this generation sucks
and i hate it.
gotta love time loops
13i love when a little line starts repeating, like "bad example" here :3
Tom Baker <3
why yes
yes I would like a jelly baby
Just how many times is this gonna loop
13get that watch fixed jack

so how is everyone doing today?
close enough Jack
13SpadeMagnes[School: we have entered an infinite recursion of time
Doctor Who is gonna be pissed
O'Neil is right on direction, but wrong on timing.
they should "kill -9" this process, it's in a loop
kill -9 universe? bad idea...
Kill 9?
Whats that?
ekips, if only the Stargate ran on Unix
Hi, AJTheMightyGamer! :)
13while (true) { time.loop() }
Hi AJIsAwesome
00,10ah this ep
13hai sumi
ohai Mica :3
Asgard?
13hope you don't mind i played some of the good season 2 eps :)
SpadeMagnes[School: its SIGKILL - means kernel is going to kill the process
THERE ARE NO BREAKS ON THE GATE TRAIN
Whats with the thing in his head?
pretty sure the universe is an upstart job
so... did i miss anything while i was not on the site?
so `restart universe`

So is this groundhog day?

"C'mon, is this the face of a crazy man?" Teal'c has his slavemark on his forehead.
GOODBYE EVERYPONY IMA WATCH SOME ANIME!
what I'd like to know is
13he's seriously a toothbrush mustache away from hitler

Dj_Cyber-4G, cool. I'm waiting for Yibis' 566

that is the only sensible answer I can think of to that picture
God damn it

Allah damn it
Noooooooooo

Bring us in 5 seconds earlier

Oh, I see. The fruit loops are glued to the spoon. So they never left the spoon when it was dropped
*Insert "magnet" line here.

oh wow

Doctor who feeling silly
I just found some information for volunteering at Buck
hi alexxm
I wanna do it
calm, stubborn, can punch you across the yard
because ponies.
how are things AJTheMightyGamer
doing good
Dark_Horst, I'm pretty sure his name is spelled Teal'c
Oh, Shizuka, nice =3
how about you?
Sumica: Did you watch the video I sent you?
Fersure: Why do you need to go looking for information?
Kandarihu: i know. i ddint spell it wrong
00,10yep
Testing.
He runs it, after all
If anything, it's a VERY vital thought that should be given, to all.
i'm good AJTheMightyGamer
Kandarihu: you be looking at Lyra` here
A infinite time loop is one event causing to cause something in the past?
Oh, sorry
Sumica: Any chance you may show it when it's feasible?
00,10posably
13SpadeMagnes[School: you're thinking stable time loop, where traveling back in time establishes the cause for said travel
Sumica: I hope you will do, Mica.
13RDA wants to eat the froot loops so bad
Sumica: Maybe something right before BMN? ;)
13>touchscreen
13>CRT monitor
13wut
00,10I was about to say that
SCIENCE!
Shizuka: Magnets was mentioned, all logic was just thrown out.
*were.
seems the prometheus wasnt the only asgard upgraded tech
haha
13we aren't up to prometheus yet at this point
it was a good plan!
<3
space yugioh lookin all smug
13though jack would have been through the fifth race so we do know the asgard at this point
Yeah
Silliest Training Montage Ever.
00,10so heres the part that makes no sence
00,10so why not call one of the gates in the bubble
13wouldn't do them any good
13they'd rubberband back to earth when the loop restarts
Sumica: They said they did-- but it would make no difference, since they are all in the same bubble.
Is the movie "Because of Winn-Dixie" an A movie or a B movie?
Perspective flip time
bonk
hahah

13IN THE MIDDLE OF MY BACKSWING?
I had to leave and I didn't see what's going on.

Lagtacular.
AJIsAwesome, yes.
Okay.
Thanks. :)
AJIsAwesome: only the two know of it
Thanks, flutter_spin. :)
XD
Only O'Neil and Teal'c were experiencing the loop.
00,1010 hour loop actaly
i want groundhog day rules for a day in new york
Do we wever find out why only O'Neil and Teal'c remember?
id have SOOO much lacivious activities :D
00,10because they were on the alter when it actvated
hi amu
13daniel got zapped, carter was tending to him, jack and teal'c went to grab archeologist hitler here
because ones black, and the other has moxxy
Hi Cades!
hitler??
13so they three are the ones outside the loop
Ahh
Ok
Malachai (who totally isn't Hitler) is also timelooping.
that reference :D
HAH
love it!
His wife is ill
So now that people are here
I was thinking
Or that...
What would you guys think about moving #spyrochat to a different network?
You insane fool
since this one is pretty much dead
he has tenacity!
he can do it!
13dude if the race that built the GODDAMN STARGATES couldn't do it
13don't think you can
those ancients were just quiters!
^
People having the same shitty cereal
probably wouldn't happen, just a thought
SpadeMagnes[School: Oh god.....
People spilling hot coffee
MASS HYSTERIA
SpadeMagnes[School: Your describing a world I do not wish to live in....
00,10he dont have the genes for it Shizuka
Would that make a difference?
then he'll be sad again :D
I KNOW
To the amount of people that would come here I mean
Not sure how much of a difference it would make. I don't think the activity of the network will change how much of the member-base joins the channel.
I don't really know
like right now the channel is just sitting here in nowhereland
I just noticed something. SG-12 came back 3 days early from a planet named Alaris, which was one of the affected planets. During some of the loops in which O'Neil and Teal'c were goofing off, they were hitting golf balls into an open stargate TO Alaris.
13eeyup
so no one ever finds out about it except by word of mouth
13but they come through shortly after the loop starts so no chance of a weird paradox of the golf balls causing the injury they come back for :3
I don't know much about the behavoir of users of other networks, so I don't know if anyone would come in and look at a new channel
Well if it means that there's a higher chance of people coming here, then I'm cool with it.
he forgot a few tries
just saying.
OATMEAL!
it's not doing us any favors to be here, that's for sure
Oh hell no!
true
haha
I cant eat fruit loops over and over and over and over again >.>
13and now we'll never know what DANIEL would do if given an infinite time loop
i can eat 12 bowls of cerial!

at least that's what the box said

i could know EVERYTHING!
oh boy
thanks for the stream Sumica

Shizuka*

Shizuka: have i ever told you how much i love you?
Chrysalis: She's not done. :D
13oo i can do this?
08,01ah, it's numbered wrong on my dvd set
Yay! Some good SBSP.
08,01i have the cheap chinese version
yes, but i dont watch spongebob
ahah
13oh no it just squishes it
so for me, the stream is over
But there's no indication of when in the loops they were doing that. I think SG-12 encountered some ill-justified hostilities from the people there. So O'Neil and Teal'c asked for permission to get back at them.
Chrysalis: Okay.
sand bob.
13hrm
"Improved Squidward's day yet!" Improved. . . Right.
gloryhole?
Lyra`: .........
13you're like a steamed vegetable only smarter

Lyra`: I enjoy that you enjoy them.
Take this for example.
AJIsAwesome: :O

/me hugs Michael back. :)
That can happen with IRC bots... >->

We should have mods streaming only horror movies/cartoons/live action series for the occasion :D
Not always :(

MadSurge: Poltergeist could be good?

On another community, there were three of us with IRC bots, and a couple of the regulars liked to bot spam sometimes.
Still need to see that one.
Iain: I'm not a gun nut, sorry :( I prefer old weapons
Next year we should celebrate Shark week by streaming different shark-based movies all week long

Dawww......in a weird way....... :S
ah
my guess is copy right shit
knowing youtube
his profile was completely erased lol
sound is off
By a little bit.
Nothing major.
and here i thought the ep wouldnt end in sex
I thought he was getting unfunny anyways
i can complain AJIsAwesome
The land before time was the one with all the dinosaurs right?
you are such a pesemist
mmmm Cornetos
lol
mentallyeffedguy: I know.
but yeah he was getting out of LBT and that's where is was funny lol
damn, now i want one:|
well, this looks strange. Was kinda hoping for somthing... cheerful, like ponies! cya!
Just throwing my two cents in.
Cades: Yeah
how come the families of the dead workers doesnt like, call the police or something?
OWWWWW HIT MY LEG BRB:'(
Still a dick to the very end.
uh
yupp
I thought that was all dicks
(rimshot)
......
The land before time is interesting and all, but I'm more interested in seeing the time before land. XD
back..
i would love to see that....except shoot him with a tank, minigun or RPG
Basically he took clips from the Land Before Time movies and put stupid youtube humor and "adult" jokes into them
Did jittery dragon just commentate over the show or something?
ah ok
I wonder what happens if you cut his head off.
>.>
all this killing, and dumping of bodies
its a power ranger
no one likes my joke
They were funny at first, but I thought they started going downhill
batman b watching
Holy ninja, batman!
It's BATMAN
mentallyeffedguy: dont forger secks, lots of it
He was running out of ideas
Wait, then which probation worker did they kill then?
AJIsAwesome: the first one
08,01one more?
AJIsAwesome: the woman in the freezer
twilight_sprinkle: AH.
or perhaps you are never satisfied
twilight_sprinkle: i dont mind the secks, i mind killing and body dumping
just search the land before time youtube poop and they'll probably be similar
MORE
ONE MORE!
MOAR!!!
mentallyeffedguy: i mind the secks more tbh
I want to know who's the British Batman
FIERFEP,GM RKGJRVNDSBKLD FVOFVK DFB

Oh, don't worry, he's taped to his own hip.
Barbetos: totally
Better than taking the warning from a mentally effed guy :D
mentallyeffedguy: or from a mentally effed guy
Funny thing about nerds, they read a lot, and study a lot. They tend to know their shit.
Who says you can't be a sex nerd?
08,01i'm a sex nerd!
Oh wait. That is a pron star.
cowvarkian: mental people have sex! alot! kinda...
mentallyeffedguy: with your hands?

Dark_Horst: Where is Michael Caine?
mentallyeffedguy: Do burpees, they're pretty awesome.
He's british, he should be there.
Randomnerd: that sounds disturbing

Jump, get down, do a push-up, then jump up again.

I'm afraid to look up the meaning
08,01well everypony, thanks for watching my stream tongiht

very much so
08,01i'm not sure if i'll sttream any more Misfits; i'll ask the other mods what they think
08,01it's getting a bit to risque to stream, i think
Anyway.
cowvarkian: the fact that guys my age dress gay?
when my friend (DoctoDoctorWho) first told me to watch mlp i called him a homoerotic prick.
08,01but we'll see
but now i lvoe the show.

That's not Gangnam..

It was a good thing the bot had the quotes separated, because there were quotes from a bunch of different networks, and not all of them were entirely appropriate for the community the channel was for.
i knew someone would link it after i said id kill them

superretroworld that was my main problem. I ordered my t-shirt online and visited 5 stores locally for pony merch. The only store is Wal-Mart, and it's on the other side of town. I had to take a bus. I could've walked, but it would've taken me well over 5 hours.

Who said it's horrible?

hi DaringDerpy
She did. And one day I swear I'll get you to stop beating yourself up, silly Shizu. :|
It's a great intermission.
^
^^
What is? The Movie night one?
" The sweetest melodies in life are the ones you're willing to listen to over and over again. "
How could you say that, Shizu? Everyone loves your intermission. :S
either none of you understand my logic, or there's a stream
Oh that part starts at 1:32 btw
and that vid-link just ruled out my second thought
/me knocks on the chat

I can't. It's four weeks until show time.
fukken election ads, go away pls

well you have to wing it out then
but seriously what I love about Background Pony is that it makes you think and see life in a different light
one aspect at a time
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifUe2So2cr4
thelonepony: YAY POLITICS!!!
Tonight's practice went straight to hell
why?
Lunar_Brony: i dont think adblock works on youtube
I was thinking about reading that CrimsonPhoenix, but I never got around to it.
twilight_sprinkle it works for ALL ads
Lunar_Brony, DO IT
NOPONY KNEW THERE LINES, THERE CUES, NOTHING. I HAD ONLY 5 LINES BUT I HAD TO STAY THERE ALL NIGHT
twilight_sprinkle: does adblock work on here?

Lunar_Brony, Seriously for the love of the show itself do it
I forgot my fucking script despite having the longest frigging lines in the play.

i once found a seed that would generate an awesome canyon landscape. but i forgot it
Hi, RDash5000. :)
RDash5000 WAZZUP!!!
Shizuka, do you time when you record the videos in Minecraft?
13actually it was the second time i tried i think, first run failed in expression
Shizuka: so thinking of redoing your old video in GLORIOUS HD instead of summer squash?
Hey, otakon
hey RDash5000
13wut
Shizuka: which texture pack are you using?
Hi RDash5000
summer squash?
13painterly
Shizuka: sorry bad joke
so much lag!
nvm
RDash5000: do NOT complain about lag
twilight_sprinkle: NO, NO, NO, NO :O. YOU TAKE THAT BACK!!!!
You were locking out a chicken? :D
superretroworld: nope
13otakon: so thinking of redoing your face in GLORIOUS HD instead of summer squashed by pool noodle?
OOOOOOOOOOOOH BUUUUUURN!
13yeah on the first run there was a chicken on the roof
oh snap
Shizuka: WHAT? I keed I keed! :D
HA! Better have burn heal!
13but anyway that's what happens when shizu records, things time perfectly without trying too hard
Blaine, I don't think a graft would cure that burn
he left
twilight_sprinkle: have you even seen flutterwonder?
ASoftFluffyThing: :D
STREAM SCARY THINGS
Shizuka: got a seed for that world or was it random generated
superretroworld, who hasn't
superretroworld: dont think i have
I noticed that in both of your Minecraft videos it's raining. Unless you managed to time the weather to a T
Shizuka: holy shit your good at minecraft
13was 1.7.3, 'Sakura'
twilight_sprinkle, you don't know PinkiePieSwear?
gonna try that
CrimsonPhoenix: dont think so
duuuuude
You're missing out
twilight_sprinkle: well youll might change your mind if you watch it
Shizuka: what game is this?
13tonight on bronystate, shizu's catalog of videos, cause we got nothin else to stream today >>
Trackmania
superretroworld: doubtful because it isnt canon
Loop-de-loos!
13and now you know where this shot came from
All the loops!
Shizuka do us a favor and stream this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP7k-3Tipp4
wait a sec
Trackmania!
twilight_sprinkle: what do you mean canon?
No video links during stream. :)
fuck
superretroworld, have you really said that Rarity is worst?
Track! Track! Shizu's a Trackmaniac!
13yeah not cool sonicdude558...
CrimsonPhoenix: YES
13this one i actually made >>
/me over reacts and hides in a corner
sonicdude558: -_-
13took like sixteen hours... way too much detail you'll never see when running it
superretroworld, I would beg to differ
I HEAR FALLOUT 3 MUSIC!
DID AH JUST HEAR FALLOU!
yes you DID
Fallout
13and yes
13and it's set to the track music as well
aw, jsut the soundtrack
I hope Hasbro keeps their promise and brings Trixie back
FALLOUT 3!
I should play the Fallout games sometime
13the intro is supposed to be synced but usually falls out of sync due to level loading
Man, I can't read all of this text
Shizuka: you ever play FO3?
13uh ja
superretroworld: well as im understanding this flutterwonder is something fanmade, so i doubt itll change my opinion on the character
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
Shizuka, how many hours did you put into your Minecraft? Because I totally envy you :3
13only finished main quest once, very bland game
Lunar_Brony: yes do that, seriously. If your PC can run it get GOTY of Fallout 3
13as for minecraft, i abuse worldedit, so usually a few days
man... i remmember launcing fallout 3 back in the day. i'd always sit there looking at the menu scren, listening to that beautiful epic soundtrack
Shizuka: >_< what about New Vegas?
twilight_sprinkle, I would agree with you on that but I have to say that music is awesome
I've never tried worldedit........
THEN i would start the game
otakon I have a major problem, though
13crashed on me, looks like looots more of the same...
I'm broke
13which is oblivion minus color
/me gets up from hiding
twilight_sprinkle: true, but lets not forrget Beep Beep
/me walks back to his computer
CrimsonPhoenix: is that the trippy thing where she follows some lights in everfre forest?
13that's the track the signature was designed for btw
so was the whole south park brony episode thing a hoax or whats going on with that?
there is $0.11 in my Steam wallet and $2.37 in my IRL wallet
13WMP loves screwing this up
twilight_sprinkle, nah that's the garden
CrimsonPhoenix: oh ok
flutterwonder is a classic brony song
Shizuka: are you kidding? NEw Vegas is a LOT more colorful in many ways then Fallout 3 you should give it a shot if you can.
0,14...I almost thought that was something out of KOF13 from the opening
Shizuka: Except it's not made by Bethesda.
Sorry about that link guise... I gotta read the rules I guess :(
oh, Thats flutterwonder, now i remember it. eh, its ok, but i dont find it amazing
Cipher: ofc you would think that
CrimsonPhoenix: sunshine and celery stalks is great too
also, OW MY EYES 2FAST
sonicdude558, you're not the only one don't worry
sonicdude558: you haven't read the rules yet?
New Vegas made me feel like I was playing one of the original Fallouts
no
Shizuka: But by Obsidian(which automatically raises it up in my ranking)
superretroworld, PinkiePieSwear is overall sweet
Man, awesome stuff here
Brad__: really?
$10 for Fallout 1, $10 for Fallout 2, $10 for Fallout 3, and $30 for New Vegas
/me slaps DashWithRainbows around a bit with a large trout
oi
wait 10 for fallout3?
Fallout 3 just felt out of place to me in the series
I do know one rule: Don't spam 3 messages every second or kick
13hm
13let's find out...
Lunar_Brony: dude Fallout 1 is a MUST BUY and you can get it cheaper
I've been thinking on playing it....
I don't even have $5
lulz
dafuq u think u doin', Joomay?
otakon where?
not u dat4u
sure
Lunar_Brony: hold on finding it now
k thx
oh...
kk
13fair warning
what really rustles my jimmies is that until today noone managed to make an actually good fallout texture pack for mc
superretroworld, according to IMDB season 16 episode 1 was supposed to be called "my little brony", but it ended up being a different episode instead, so im wondering if they are going to move it to another episode this season
13it's usually pretty boring to watch
Shizuka, I also plays Trackmania in case you haven't known yet...
Hmm, Fallout 3 GotY is $20
Just a bare fact.
Brad__: that will be an interesting episode
How long did it take for dabi to come back dwr?
Kandarihu: when they do special offers it gets even cheaper, you wouldnt believe how much game you get there for your money
superretroworld, totally, if it actually happens :P they usually write the episode a week before it airs.
I have found a duplicate of the same rule
*a
So, in case if you want, we can race sometime...
...Maybe.
Dark_Horst, I know. I'm kicking myself for not getting those games during the Summer Sale
Kandarihu: but really... you should get that game. the goty edition is the basegame plus all addons. that is so much addiction for so few moneyz!
is the stream on?
Joomay he took hours
Yep
Cretor: it is
he wus cryin'
And that Hearthfire DLC for Skyrim makes me REALLY want that game now.
POP POP
and stoof
got it to work
13hm
lets watch bathboys: clone
jk he came back about 20 mins later or something.
Rofl
that reminds me of how i still have to get the addons for my skyrim
Shizuka: I think pink or red's your favortie color, isn't it...?
totally slept over that
*favorite
13bleh come on stupid game...
what is it you're trying to launch?
Can we watch some mlpytps like i suggested yesterday? I cant find any new ones that are worth watching.
I see Shizuka runing Trackmania United Forever, so I launch my Nations Forever. But Steam is converting content
So who wants to be in my Trackmania buddy list?
Kandarihu: Why? There are mods for that stuff. (Except if you have console version - then there was no question)
That's what it says
Cretor: Just letting you know, they'll request videos to play.
Sometimes.
Okie Dokie, I read the rules.
Cretor: So you're better off waiting until then.
Gotcha
I've never seen Shizuka play this game before. This is SO AWESOME! /)^3^(\
13lul
13i am so out of practice
AJIsAwesome not quite sure what you mean though 6_9
He does it rarely, I also plays Trackmania too.
I think I understand some of this
Cretor: They'll open a request channel where you can put in your requests.
If you run into a wall, or fly off the track, you restart
Shizuka: That's okay, I'm always out of pratice too, since because i'm a novice in Trackmania.
13well
13this is 1024x768
CHOCOLATE!!!!
Dat CHOCOLATE
dem bumps
13mixing down to 640x480
13at maximum graphics
The video gets garbled when there is moving video
We must go to plaid.
sonicdude558, different issue. Shizuka's game has so much motion that the video has to be EXTREMELY compressed to go out to mips at a bitrate that most of us can handle.
ah thats the word. Compressed
Shizuka wants your chocolate...ALL OF THEM
13yeah if you guys think it's blurry for stream
13just picture me having to react to this....
Shizuka do you have a Rainbow Dash car?
What? What are they selling?
13i have no idea how many replays it took for me to finish
08,01Kandarihu: i've not been streaming for the last... hour or so?
how do i get this game?
idk I have never played it
Steam, I think.
I would do a simple search on Trackmania
Chocolate!
Hi Ponies47
sounds goo.
/me glomps Ponies47
good*
/me Huggles sonicdude558 in return
dang. 11 minutes till bed.
time to start working on that biography :/
why does MSI play over and over again?
13it's the track song
13you can set a custom song for your track
13anyway, let's see mah car
I bet its epik
ooooo
Ah, the perks of United
smexy
hi guys
Nice, i would have a really long one like masture of puppets if i where you

Hi AJIsAwesome
*^^
DAT CAR
oooohhhh
Nice car Shizuka
DAT VHX
Dose warm colurz!
13my rule for making the trackmania videos is A) i would use a fresh replay to get the most recent skin
13and B) i had to beat my previous best
13as you can imagine, that firebrand track took me FOREVERRRRRR
Forever?
4 ever
That's means....FOUR evers!
gasp
:O
Wow, now I learned that $5 Lumber supports are a piece of junk.
/me GraceNote
Hey

Shizuka: Is Tom the crazy chocolate fish your ping now or something? :P
CHOCOLAAAAAATE!
13is mah horn

Shizuka: Ah. Nice! XD
Chocolate is the color of your horn?
Mm'kay.

anypony wanna play some minecraft im on this almost empty server
nah I got 4 mins to bed anyways
I can't Minecraft online
brb guys
I would wif u if I had more time
or at all on this computer
Lunar_Brony: why?
ill play with you brony2447
nvm
dunno, can't play online
Lunar_Brony: Do you have Xbox Live?
authors of this songs are two lesbian girls
no
Cretor: yay! ill get the ip real quick
yo Shizuka you are a boss @ trackmania
*song
kay
twilight_sprinkle: Seriously?
brony2447: PC or Xbox?
Lunar_Brony: Oh. If you did I was gonna suggest getting the xbox version
either but im on PC now
twilight_sprinkle: They're not lesbian really
AJIsAwesome: yep, at least that used to be their image back in the day
AH.
Okay.
I wonder if the game would look better on the steram if Shizuka would be willing to turn the game resolution down to 640 x 480
twilight_sprinkle, you're talking about Tatu?
Cretor: 193.35.57.25:25588
ill do it some other time brony2447 my computer cant handle bronystate and mincraft at the same time
CrimsonPhoenix: yes
Cretor: aww, come on :(
I kinda loved those a bit
13not really
Am I hearing what I think I'm hearing? "Not near the courtyard"
13at 640x480 on a 1440x900 screen
13it's unplayable
Shizuka, sorry. I see
13also you're hearing "nas ne dogonyat"
Cretor: minecraft is laggy on my computer :[
twilight_sprinkle: It was just a marketing gimmick, back when people were "shocked" by this:P
hey I have a crappy 1440x900 screen too!
13you can tell the kind of reflexes you need to win this
Do you like chocolate?
brony2447: Ill play w/ you!
And im interested with shizuka on this game
sonicdude558: theyre singing nas ne dogonyat, which means "we cant be caught" or "(they) cant catch us"
13anyway my car has a custom shadow of wings~
CrazyHippie: great! here is teh IP: 193.35.57.25:25588
neat
I see them
SirGanjalf: k
brony2447: dude, PM that next time
Eddmario yeah, I wouldn't even if I did. I feel like it's treating the player like a complete Minecraft noob, automatically filling out crafting recipes and warning you when you dig straight down or straight up.
ok thx twilight_sprinkle
I have 1 more min till bed :(
otakon: k srry about that :$
so I will take this time to say
Bye all! :)
twilight_sprinkle: What language is that in?
seeya sonicdude558
Bye, sonicdude558. :)
AJIsAwesome: rashan
Ok.
bye sonicdude558
brony2447: just telling you for your own safety, you don't want it to be public info do ya?
Thanks. :)

Trackmania
CHOCOLAAAAAAATE
Good night Shizuka
otakon: good point thx for saying :)
0,14not sure if Godsmack
brony2447: np
/me hugs everyone in the chatroom, including the mods
It is godsmack
Perfect timing for a EQD post
All Shizu wants is CHOCOLAAAAATE! CHOCOLAAAAATE!
Your horn fits this song, Shizuka:P
ah boring stuff
Good night for real now
Good night sonicdude558.
Night son...
name of the song?
DO A BARREL ROLL
SirGanjalf: CHOCOLAAAAAATE!
^ :D
CHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOCOLATE!
*bleeds from cookies he/she is eating
Godsmack - Chocolate, got it
but, srsly?
flutterchu: I thought I patched up your bleeding.
AJIsAwesome: a patch cant clear an uppercut
>Mute this
>Play City Escape
((The song))
Im not sure the name of the song SirGanjalf but all godsmack songs sound the same so you can just listen to anyone of them.
It feels so amazing
"working"
flutterchu: Never underestimate the powers of patching.
huh?
Man, it would be great if we could just all get on a single Trackmania server.
Thatd be cool
So much chaos on the track. :D
AJIsAwesome: Discord made that track.
:O
if wonder if my pc could easily handle 100+ cars on a single track
I knew it. :D
Speed of Chocolate:O
no one signed up on my camp today :(
DAT TURBO
flutterchu: camp?
Almost as fast as Ludicrous Speed
The plot of the game: One day, Shizuka sees a car made of chocolate, it was SO tasty looking that he raced it to this day, The End!
Cretor: not what you really think but i dont want to talk about it
:( but i wanna know
BFDI Camp?
cupcake camp
twilight_sprinkle: :D
Cretor: um.....im...sorry...um...no
It's BFDI camp, right?
Shizuka should read us cupcakes.
AJIsAwesome: um..yes
y-yes
flutterchu: Got it right!
whats BDFI
ok. NOW it's time to start
I think it stands for Battle For Dream Island, I think.
burger donation faculty inc.
twilight_sprinkle: WUT? :D
twilight_sprinkle: season 1 opening http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EwggOWkdo
Chocolate cars would be a serious danger to the traffic - not because of temp. or sth, but because of drivers eating them slowly instead watching the road
No vid links during stream, flutterchu. :)
13Cretor: No.
Shizuka: it was only 9 seconds :'(
Cretor: No.
SHIZUKA D: WHAAYYY!?!
Cupcakes
IM kidding i never want to hear/read that again.
then don't suggest it
0,14this song sounds familiar
That girl is...
Is...
flutterchu: ok
I have no freakin' idea.
It would be interesting shizuka doing that though...
i got kicked :'(
i cant stop saying 'POP POP'
that was why i didnt want to talk about it
superretroworld: watch something else then
0,14ah
You could've PM it. :S
0,14POD's Youth of the Nation
otakon: cant help it, i love community
Im dizzy now.
Phase4: should I delete system32?
JRP, you can try
sleep it off Cretor
ohai Phase4
>Delete system32?
^
o.o
>32 less systems to worry about!
thelonepony: I was the car thing spinning around tripped my brain.
AJIsAwesome: Yes
AJIsAwesome: *joking*
SirGanjalf: I know. :D
CHOCOLAAAAATE! is Shizuka's term for ragequit.
delete system 32 and the recycling bin
Just kidding.
oh, eww. a racing game.
eww humans
hi Lyra`
Is she playing this live? Or is it still a replay?
What I left
i was pinged
Lies
oh hai
Eww this unfunny message.
but the pings were invisible
hi Lyra`
Kandarihu live IIRC
D:
Lyra`: not really, laps. Shizuka is streaming atm and also hi.
hiya Phase4
is this F-Zero?
Nope.
13live
brony2447: enope
Trackmania
13i just died for you
Alright. Online or offline?
Shizuka: yay LIVE!
might as well be :P
oh, if its Shizuka, im okay with it, because shes my lesbian wifu, she just doesnt knwo it yet :3
Sorry, Shizuka
Lyra`: -_- please keep that kind of stuff to a minimum? please? pretty please?
we watching trackmania?
Yep.
eeyup Rustymeat
'remember, i died for your sins!'
AJIsAwesome: Or delete entire WINDOWS folder. I mean, you're already using Windows - why would you need a folder for it?
more like our entertainment
SirGanjalf: :D
Rustymeat, what could this possibly be other than Trackmania? ... or Trackmania 2?
I don't even verb.
Wut?
Yeah that was kind of a dumb question
Well, your guess was spot on
i forgot i made tea
and it was sitting on my nightstand
Shizuka: Have you heard of Trackmania 2 yet?
and now its cold :(
13yes it sucks
NO!
THe COLD IS AWESOME!
I LOVE THE COLD!
otakon, shut it
im australian
Cold tea is bleeeeegh
Shizuka: It does?
it's better than sweating my ass off
i dont DO cold
I love the cold too!
13one environment
the cold :(
13sucks
13also i made this track
0,14I hate the cold, love the snow
13it also sucks
Lyra`: seriously it's better than sweating into a puddle of humanity
Na, sweating is better.
i liek fog....just not cold
cold tea isn't good if you not intend it to be cold
Lyra`: and I thought you Aussie's were tough.
so, you dont like it when girls are in a puddle of sweaty humanity?
I LOVE it when it's cold. :D
Why you think that everything sucks, Shizuka?
i like the cold :3
coffee - not that bad
(the teachers are starting to beleve im a lizard)
i know what i spelled.
When it comes to cold weather, we hate it. lulz
It's around 55 degrees. Loving every second of it.
Lyra` wha?
Lyra`: that's different, haven't you seent hat commercial? Sweaty Girl= Hot, Sweaty Guy= Stinks, Sweaty big guy? disgusting. I'm the third catergory
Who else is exited for the new walking dead episode?
im the first
I don;t lik cold tea. All I taste at that point is sugar.
13can't see anything capn ><
:3
heating up when youre cold > cooling off when youre hot
I just swalloed glass, on accident.. O_O
ouch
Ouch...
It didnthurt but im scared
Ouch, Cretor. You might want to get to a hospital or doctor.
flutterchu: PLEASE don't remind me of that Pop Tart commercial, it doesn't made any sense.
OH BOY OH BOY Look at what Peta's been doing now http://i.imgur.com/CPRlM.jpg
You should tell someone about that.
i think you should go to the hospital
dont move too much for the next hour
think you'll be fine or do you think you need to go somewhere for that?
Cretor, as long as it doesnt lodge itself inside your intestines
youre fine
Like, right now.
if youre cold you can at least warm up, but if its too hot and you dont have an ac, nothing will help
unfortunatly
dont pirce your esophagus
twilight_sprinkle: EXACTLY!
CrimsonPhoenix: WUT
youre going to have to sift thru your stool from now on
Lyra': Ill keep that in mind. I chewd it up alot so ill be fine.
about three days should be long enough to be sure.
AJIsAwesome, I'm cureently playing the game
you can only shed so much clothing until your naked and STILL sweating like you're on fire
kk
it's hilarious
Cretor was it from a broken cup?
while you can bundle and warm yourself
CrimsonPhoenix: DEATH TO PETA!!
Oh, PETA. You idiots.
You swallowed glass? why would you do that?
HOW would youdo that.
Cretor how did it managed to get to your mouth?
0,14for a moment there, that looked like a Delorean
CrimsonPhoenix, can I kick PETA in the head? I'll leave some left for you to kick or punch. :3
Be my guest
Really wish PETA would try to stop doing these things. They're making themselves look worse than they need to be.
I just think they're hilarious really
I was chewing on plastic i had on my bed and somhow one of these lights got on there then i heard a crunch.
I haven't heard anything from PETA nowadays
First Cooking Mama...then Super Mario 3D Land...or Pokemon?
PETA doesn't get donations and attention by being moderate and trying to have workable solutions towards animal issues
VenHur: Wait. Cooking Mama?
they get money by doing crazy stupid things
They attacked Cooking Mama of all things?
I'm starting to think that Peta are trolling the video game industry.
You should chew on pens like a civilized person from now on
oh yeah they also attacked super meat boy at some point
jesus
Super Tofu Boy. :D
VenHur, oh you haven't seen the New Super Mario bros one?
with KFC?
CrimsonPhoenix: http://www.halolz.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/halolz-dot-com-pokemon-letsfightourpetstothedeath-comic.gif
What's next, Peta making a My Little Pony flash?!
Cretor well, if it were me, I would get that checked out just in case
sounds about right
VenHur, funny you say that but I saw that flash in /mlp/ with the OP saying the same thing
VenHur it's popular, it's all the talk over the internet, it's the perfect tareget
I was like sand when i swalloed and it wasnt alot because i spit out immediatley
there's one problem though
there's nothing in MLP for abuse
why was it so far in your mouth that you could swallow it at all? Got to be more careful next time brah
PeTA: Bronies are hurting real life ponies' feelings!
Hah okay
PEta will find a way
I mean, sure there's no animal abuse in the sh- *remembers Twilight getting injured by a piano and other things by Derpy* On second thoughts, never mind.
nochangelings were harmed in the making of a canterlot weeding part 2
:D Peta on Pokemon now - not sure if bigger low than their Tanuki Mario huff - and they didn't even bother mentioning the whole jumping on turtles :D
So we're about 20-30 days away from season 3 right?
whose excited?
SirGanjalf: Speaking of Peta, they did another stupid Nintendo parody game, this time with Pokemon. You know "catching Pokemon is bad"
ugh
they're using pokemon as victims now?
13so yeah i made this track
PETA is evil
PETA IS EVIL
0,14...did that car take off BTTF style?
13was not nearly this dark on the system i built it on though...
do you KNOW what they do to pets?
Who have heard of the OTHER Peta by the way?
They euthanize them outright?
*.
pika pi :'(
They take perfectly adoptable pets
and euthanize them
Wow.
TheMaster: not only that but from SHELTERS too
I think I remember that on one recent occassion, I actually agreed with PETA on something. I don't remember the details, but I think it involved ACTUAL animal abuse.
J_E_Smith: Only PeTA's game i've heard about til then was Super Tofu Boy
Charrrrrrrilllllleeeee
anyways, how is this game? you customize tracks and whatnot?
otakon: what does euthanize mean?
meh. There are a lot of dogs and cats. They arn't going to go extinct and as long as they're not torturing them then whatever.
flutterchu: kill
PETA should NEVER bashes the Bronies, think of the ponyity if such a flash game is made!
Cypresswolf: :D
0,14that car looks like a mix between a muscle car and a Delorean
0,14I need it
well im gonna go play borderlands 2
Bye, Rustymeat. :)
Rustymeat: what system?
360
Rustymeat: if 360, add me. I'm otakon17
bye Rustymeat
chaaaaa ,/)_(\
oh cool ill ad you then
13problem is the island cars are touchy as hell ><
Rustymeat: I'm level 50 Gunzerker with Teh Bee and I can farm the last boss and Terramorphus
The Delorean mk ii? (Mark Two)
I volunteered at a animal shelter actually. They had a crematorium and beleive me, I saw piles of euthanized dogs and cats. Perhaps not the best thing for a 12 year old to see but whatev
ah neat
Rustymeat: srs, friend me. Tag is otakon17, we can play sometime this wekk
lol i just claimed a desert island for my faction for no reason :P
I heard the bee is aan op weapon
*week
13this one i also made
im a lvl 40 gunzerk
Rustymeat: not a weapon, amp shield. Used with a high pellet Shotgun it's OP
NewSuperBronyU: eggs
it has no amp penalty right?
Rustymeat: yeah I can help you level if you want to fifty off of the Warrior AND get you some selling loot and stuff for you when you hit 50 later on.
Rustymeat: eeyup
Dogs & Cats are just kept around for emergency food when things get bad - Have you learned nothing from Excel Saga?
>Peta Pokemon trading card
thats how it was in the 40s anyway
so much hilarity
Shizuka: Do you play other racing games? Like say, Need for Speed, Burnout, or Gran Turismo?
er 30s
Cypresswolf: Poor dog...
right now im focusing getting all the challenges done
The whole saga with Super Tofu Boy turned out epically, though.
regions specificly
Rustymeat: ah, well good luck. Challenges are best done in regular mode though
i'm suprised nobody ever says poor cow or pig. But then again they are really delicious
Rustymeat: at lv 50 you can more or less pull stuff off without dying
is that... that racing game in Shizuka's outro?
Ryunosuke, eeyup
Yup.
TheMaster: okay but they are bred for eating and I DO feel guilt and always thank my meat before I eat. But that's just me.
pika pika pi pi pika pikachu (translation: im speakng pikachu so you all cant understand me)
because a cow or apig willnever love you
ahh
no
just no
flutterchu: Um...we can hear your thoughts you know.
Track mania I take it?
CHOCOLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATE
Hey Shizuka. What do you use to play trackmania?
Ryunosuke: eeyup
That CHOCOLATE scream is Shizuka's horn, right?
either chat derped or died
Starlight_Phoenix: keyboard mouse ofc
I didn't know fish can survive on land craving for sweets
Kandarihu: Yup.
I cant read that tiny assed font in the corner :p
13isn't it obvious
13keyboard
Lunar_Brony: you got derp
Nice horn.
I read the banner
Keyboard is your horn?
otakon figured that
Or is it chocolate?
I'm gonna have to revert my ping if I'm gonna do my Pony Fast
Kandarihu: pony fast?
what kind of pony are ya doing?
I wouldnt mind raising chickens again - havent had since I moved to college - got several for easter every year since I was a little tike. but they attracted all kinds of predators, hawks, dogs, sometime cats
http://i.imgur.com/4ApwQ.png My sides
Can you use a x360 or steering wheel?
Cypresswolf: ugh I lived on a chicken farm. Smelled of hot mayo for 10 years...still like chicken though
13assume so
longest we had a chicken was about 6 years,rooster actually, think a hawk got him
:'(
13but controllers cost as much as a decent keyboard
I just assumed that you use a controller.
13and have about a hundred less buttons and usefulness
Starlight_Phoenix: yh but why buy one when she can use the ky and mouse? Shizu is good with them
13i hate controllers
If Season 3 isn't going to premier by the time of the election, I might as well fast on watching anything related to MLP. I gotta fast on something.
i got a controller for 30$ shizuka
13this i also made
workes good for halo ce
Shizuka: good for you, I hate using four fingers to try to move in diagonal directions
I can't do movement on the keyboard
there is no give
Your good.... at this Shizuka
I'll probably fast on gaming once the IGG Marathon is done.
it's either full speed single direction or full stop
13that scoreboard
13is the world record for this track i made
13i think my best is 1:10
13so yeah >>
Shizuka: nice :)
Nice.
I would whistle if I could
Same here.
I'm over twice as old as my sister and she can whislte
*whistle
she's 6
Everyone in my family can except me. *sigh*

/me whistles
Whistling is easy, man.

oops :(
pinkie and the brain?
Lyra` oh dear, that poor boy
/me plays Gangnum Syle
justice league
yea I remember
:<
Animaniacs.
his parallel earth burned in nuclear balefire
Lyra`: that poor little bastard :(
and he was the ONLY survivor on the planet
What was wrong with him?
I think we had 3 parakeets actually - the first one was a brat, always tried to bite when you put your hand in the cage to change out the food/water dishes or clean its mirror
that one flew out the door after it was left open
he developed psychic and reality warping powers
I've ALWAYS wanted a parrot as a pet.
Lyra` no there were more, he used them as slaves to his imagination though
its an episode of Justice League
AJIsAwesome: just put your lips in a tube shape and move your tongue around, it should be bent upwards, somewhat close to the upper mouth part
Lyra`: also mutated horribly AND had his psyche warped by it... along with amazing reality altering powers. I wonder what ever happened to him..
05its 4:36am...

for no recompense
I just need good tutorials on how to make the stuff, ive tried in the past and it turned out shit.
so be GRATEFUL you're getting a stream
Cretor the best action plan from here on would just be to STFU
Shizuka: I think a pool noodle use is in order
no offence
Cretor: you can find those elsewhere
and not the eternal buffer of our lady Luna.
Cretor: I hear they're posts on dA that teach you some tips.
Spectrum_Rush shit's gettin' real, eh?
Howdy y'all!

Hi, Arcane_. :)
I like rct 3's additions

dammit, i'm picturing myself holding the gamecube controller hammering L and R while making the turns 6_9
allo Arcane_
Guess what im playing
Like being able to open and test coasters without completing them, leading to very unique crashes
Arcane_: pattycake?
Hello Kitty Online?
Arcane_ is it something pokemon related?
Yes
Arcane_: Hotel Mario?
Arcane_: Pokemon black 2:3
OH
it's you.
Pokemon boi
Arcane_: Pokemon Black 2? :3
Cipher random Halo reach weapon for me to use it's firing sound as my notification
Yesh to you both :3
except Human snoipah
/me slaps DoshWithReenbows around a bit with a large trout
you chav.
aha, I think I might get black 2 since white 2 doesnt' have hard mode, lame
Shaddap
Dken2021: hard mode?
JMO, you like Boardgame-Online?
Also, its*
No I like ponies.
pattycake AND hellokitty online? thats some serious multitasking

YES
Im also on skype with my friend while robo tripping o:
I LOVE THIS SONG!
thisguy I also love ponies
Joomay: Ha, gaayyyy!
0,14Concussion rifle, DoshWithReenbows
i r so gay 4 ponies
AJIsAwesome a mode where the difficulty is ramped up, ie: foe's pokemon lvs are higher, smarter AI
Hmm, cheers Saxy.
Ah.
This jazz is so smooth
I see.
I've got the sound stored already
im just sliding everywhere
IT'S SO SMOOTH, I CAN'T TAKE IT!
Yeah Also its put on set battle mode kinda like when you play multi player
Dken2021: wait so black 2 has hard mode but not white 2?
This game defys all physics and push them aside.
twilight_sprinkle yea, white 2 instead has easy mode
That's unfair to people who bought White 2.
/me is watching justice league
VenHur: you could say it kicks logic out and does the impossible
and its AMAZING
well you can transfer the modes via IR
Dken2021: huh, thats new.
even better the second time ^-^
it thrives on the impossible :P
but you have to have someone else to have another copy, ie: no internet transfer
should I ask?
well that sucks
well at least theres a hard mode at all, the easy grind fest was getting old
^
^^
XD
http://images.4chan.org/b/src/1349749179242.jpg dont worry its appropriate, i just thought it was funny.
I really did wanted white 2 cause of the version exclusives, but oh well
Cretor, kinda racist
......
^^
lol stereotypes
Not really.
das racist bro
theres nothing wrong with liking chicken
Cretor: http://www.jerzeyric.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Thats_Racist_1-3d_phase.gif

It's HLG for me, mate.
MLG for Scoots.

Get it roight.
It's MLG, DoshWithReenbows. Get it right. :P

Guys guess what
Yes, Arcane_?
MLG sux though.
HLG is betta.

But thats the 2nd time, from the same person.
Haku thinks that unless there is proof that something is bad or is unaminously believed toi be bad, its up to the viewer to distinguish bad from good
AJIsAwesome: B-But :'(
I'm.still getting borderlands 2. Not onky is it epic but I'm sure the co-op shall ruke.

It's VERY hard to find people who like Gen 3.
I really enjoyed playing Sapphire and Emerald. Crystal was a very good game as well.
I'll just see myself out.
HAHAHAHA
^^
oh wait
we are talking about pokemon
I enjoyed G3.5.
Oh that confusion. gold.
AJIsAwesome:im not one of them i only like G4 and G1
i guess i can say that i like all gen's
I thought we were talking abaout mlp
well besides the surf route, nothing was wrong with gen 3, heck it introduced secret bases, which I wish they brought back
exept 3.6
Lol, don't give a shit.
Pokemon > MLP
Anyday
I like all the gens. Gen 3 is one of my favorites.
Osnap
Ohhh, you talking about Pokemon, not MLP...
My bad.
Hello Kitty > Pokemon
DashWithRainbows: i thought you said you hated pokemon
sup DWR
when I heard DashWithRainbows talkiing about G3, I thought he liked G3 mlp :p
I hate things in varying levels.
DashWithRainbows: do you hate blood
I liked ALL the generations, but Ruby Version is where I started playing Pokemon in the first place.
Yes.
About to Battle Slater
:3
Ryunosuke: :).
VenHur:i played it in fire red it was on an emulator
i dont mind pokemon, I just dont find it appealing anymore
That's alright, mate.
*gen 1 ash voice* ALL RIGHT
I can't wait for the Generation 3 remakes...
Ryunosuke: That's fine.
Gen 5 is not that bad as...
Ryunosuke why does that name sound so farmilare?
YES VenHur
YEEESSSSSSSS
egh
I didn't care for gen iv though
Keep your remakes
Gen 4 was.................ehh.
well when you been playing since Red/Blue/Yellow, it gets kind of old :p
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0P1gESvjY6Y&feature=g-u-u
Gen 4...
it was too slow
XCOM TOMORROW!
HELLS YEAH
Not a huge fan of that one.
^
Ryunosuke, do you still remember buying them brand new off shelf?
I do :p
http://www.ebay.com/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=221134016497
Same. Those were the days.
Thats pretty expensive...
Might as well called the remakes "LavaRuby Version" and "SeaSaphire Version".
/me is old, GET OFF MY LAWN
Only thing I liked from Gen 4 was the physical-special-status split.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBPdtMJwycA&feature=relmfu
also by generation i though you meant MLP i like all the pocket monsters generations
The only thing I liked from Gen 4 was two more Eevee-lutions.
^
^^
Well, that and Porygon-Z.
Gen 1-5 <3
That thing is a monster.
Aye.
~i killed my best freind i heard the screams, but there haunting me in my dreams~
I like all the gens, but an varying levels.

yeah it is haha
You could do a GTS glitch to get a shiny lvl 100 Porygon-Z

:o
unless it's playstation not really
hi hi puffy ami yumi!
I have a ton of playstation stuff
YES
I love that show. :D
what's not to love about a janitor of the future trying to get his fame into heriosm?
um I don't have any rare playstation stuff
well I don't know what you really consider rare for playstation lol
Final Fantasy 7
Hi Hi Puffy Ami Yumi wasn't a very successful tv show here.
that's rare? lol I know it's popular as shit but I have two copies
Cranberry_Scotch: Where do you live?
A PS2 game that youd have to spend over $50 to buy
florida
Ah.
yea, that show didn't do that well
I consider it uncommon
two brand new copies?
It didn't. *sigh8
*sigh*
0,14the Booster Gold episode from Smallville was really good
I did watch it sometimes though
But I loved EVERY MINUTE of it. :D
0,14written by Geoff Johns <3
one is unused
but idk what condition it's in after being in storage so long
You know Code Lyoko?
yup, sadly didn't see how it ended
Yep.
I think we are far apart in our categorys of collecting :P
I loved that show.
Cranberry_Scotch: Return to the Past now
love the show
well the only thing I collect serious are coins and money
I bucking LOVED Ed Edd n' Eddy <3<3<3
And of course they're bringing Lyoko back
They're well into development of their reboot
and guns I guess
I actually had a mini crush on Ami as a kid. :$
Cranberry_Scotch: Nice.
and I have a pokemon card collection that is prolly worth a pretty penny lol
And DKen, it ended with the super computershut down
Well, I got to go to sleep...
Night VenHur
I never completed my collection of pokemon
Night, VenHur. :)
night VenHur
seeya VenHur
nighty VenHur
But I have a bunch of extra copies of pokemon gb games
Dken2021: Yeah it was pretty much a clip show ep with them shutting down the supercomputer
yeah I have a bunch of those too
Night Venhur
and a couple pokemon gameboys, those are worth some bucks
oh that's kinda unsatisfying
Oh, this new season or series or whatever, isa combination live action/3D animation
Though the new Lyoko will be live action in the real world
i have a couple of silver and red stamped two dollar bills from just before the great depression
Dken2021: Well that's because they destroyed XANA in the next to last ep
are the actors french?
13did sumica ever get through season 1
code Lyoko was always a french cartoon
13would not want to jump to season 3 with lost ponies
iirc, don't think so
why is the B movie created by Laura Faust
I have some mercury dimes and some silver certificates
?
she was a producer
those are my oldest things when it comes to currency
oh okay
Also, why wouldn't it be? :D

J_E_Smith thanks, but I'm gonna have to backtrack where I left off
Dken2021: Which ep was that?
I use to have it on DVD but then my brother destoryed it :(
Id say one of the rarist things I have is a goldstar game console
yeah i'd say so
I had two, sold one last year
how?
that sucks :(
and why?
J_E_Smith I forget, but it was around the time William was XANA-possesed and them tryin to find aletia's dad
It sucked, its a bad time to sell stuff like that right now
Invi: He just broke the disk in half because he's a jerk
yeah
who broke what in half??
Wasn't there an episode where Ulric was cut in half In Lyoko?
Shizuka, you had pink hair in highschool? O-o

During beta you need a key as stated you can get alpha squad which is instant beta access and a nice extra starting package for when it comes out etc

/me Meanwhile, Meanwhile can't make his name joke
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides

Was it?

Just take it easy, SeaponiesofLiverpool. :S

Meanwhile where dinosaurs are invisible
Is there a dinosaur in the chatroom?

Y'know, normally I like school, but I've missed the shit out of my bronystaters. How's everyone been?

DaringDerpy: Ooohhhh :(

im so glad i bough my sonic screwdriver :>, i just checked the website and they are out of stock o.o
bought*
Ugh why am i still not doing my project
because lazyitis
because bronystate is distracting you :>
creative avoidance
BronyState is equal and opposite to productivity
depends how you define productivity
School-related productivity, I should say
Nice timing me. XD
Is there ANYthing showing in the stream?
the circle of life
The buffer show if that counts
Arcane_: http://derpface.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Ermahgerd-Merdern-Werferr.png
My entire life depends on this project
errm wrong link
spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace
yet I cant bring myself to do it
http://thenewspatroller.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Get-stuff-done-today.jpg
Sir Bufferson is fighting the dreaded buffer dragon
then by the gods don't do it!
with all your power
Seee now im giggling
Most def not gonna get it done
Is there ANYthing showing in the stream?
Arcane_: Don't allow yourself to do anything else, and eventually your brain will find it more interesting than nothing
SharkMane: No.
nope
I'm off then, later everyone! XD
:)
tSparx: this is how I get things done too. nothing else for the whole planned time. no matter if I do what I planned or not, but no other things allowed
-no +doesn't
usually I end up working as planned
DaringDerpy I usually have just enough discipline and skill to procastinate and get work done well at the last minute, but in desperate times, I will smoke and then not do anything else but work.
Spectrum_Rush: ah yes, i couldnt find that one
That only works, of course, if you can do good work and be high at the same time. But there is no boredom quite like high boredom.
smoking is a bad idea
what other version?
can't concentrate when high
DaringDerpy: Maybe you can't. The first time I ever smoked I wrote a philosophy paper. Got an A+ on it.
DaringDerpy: I've not smoked dozens of times, I can work just as well high as I can not high -- no better, but no worse either.
and you think you couldn't have done that sober?
hm...
I've now* smoked dozens of times
tSparx: oi, twilight wouldnt appreciate you smoking :I
twilight_sprinkle: I talk about my drug use all the time on here, how come I come back for the first free night I've had in weeks and people suddenly give me a hard time?
twilight_sprinkle: :P
tSparx: I have smoked for eight years. Almost daily. Brought only problems.
tSparx: cause smoking is bad
tSparx: and i think you were told that before
I lived near the border. Lots of opportunities to make money. ;)
and it was not too expensive. 300€ for 50g
twilight_sprinkle: I've been hearing it all my life. You might consider it bad; the Rastafarians consider it a holy way to talk to God. I think God gave to us "every plant bearing fruit and every herb bearing seed," and that includes the cannabis plant -- especially if it includes the tobacco plant.
Spectrum_Rush: ah
tSparx: so god wants you to smoke and screw up your lungs?
tSparx: and screw with other aspects of your health, including thinking?
http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2pazpy30L1r10378.png
tSparx: you believe this? do you believe in tv ads too?
twilight_sprinkle: Cannabis has actually been shown to help against lung cancer -- now as a man of science I'll freely admit that there hasn't been enough study to make that *fact*, but it is theory.
tSparx: tobacco, on the other hand, is known for screwing up lungs.
yes yes, cannabis heals cancer, feeds the poor and brings world peace
DaringDerpy: I don't watch television; any shows I watch, I watch DVR'd.
twilight_sprinkle: And I don't smoke cigarettes.
well i got to go guys. see you all later
DaringDerpy: Nonsense.
DaringDerpy: Weed isn't holy. It's not evil either.
that's what the addicts preach
bye andy
Night andy
bye andy
bai andy
tSparx: you just mentioned tobacco. plus ive heard a lot of theories on how smoking helps, but all i see is addiction
twilight_sprinkle: I'm not gonna stop anyone from smoking tobacco, but I don't.
tSparx: smoking other things is bad too, especially for your thinking. and its known to cause addiction
twilight_sprinkle: Psychedelic drugs don't have a method of physical addiction. That's not even far out there -- that's just chemical fact. And you can get mentally addicted to anything.
I find the cannabis addicts funny. "Weed is not addictive! I just go out of my way for this stuff every single day because I have no reason not to!"
DaringDerpy: I haven't smoked in weeks. I have 1,300 dollars in my bank. I'm probably not an addict.
probably not
you risk an addiction by using it. always
http://www.hilariousheadlines.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/funny-dogs-guns-photo-5.jpg
tSparx: so ive heard, but people who smoke it praise it too much to sound un-addicted.
a mental addiction is an addiction
any colt scout in here is probably thinking "wtf?"
the effect is the same
twilight_sprinkle: DaringDerpy I'm done talking about this.
WTF?
poor dog
o:
tSparx: just know that its risky, and if you screw up your health or mind, especially as a scientist, youre screwed for life
anyway i need to go now, night.
twilight_sprinkle: I'm not a scientist, I'm a theologian.
twilight_sprinkle: G'night!
twilight_sprinkle: I just appreciate the scientific method.
twilight_sprinkle: Night t-sprinkle :)
twilight_sprinkle: Sleep well.
good night twilight_sprinkle :)
Scientific method, best thing ever invented.
nite twilight_sprinkle
http://i.qkme.me/35n93j.jpg
WHOOP WHOOP!
Kinixys: Amen! Religion on its own worked for a while, but then people, especially my predecessors in the Catholic Church, overstepped the bounds of faith. Science put religion back in its place, and thank God for it.
http://i245.photobucket.com/albums/gg78/evalana/blog%202/mlpfim_ep1513.png
SCIENCE!!
yay
... Who's in charge of the streaming?
no one
the stream is out of control
usually the mods

Mods are asleep?

YEEAH!!
SharkMane: the mods are never asleep. they're just luling you into a faulse sence of security
if you say their name, they come for you
NNN0000000OO!!!
/me dammit ArmaII install faster :<
tSparx: I'm not sure what sort of balance could exist between the two. Scientific method is covering the material world rather well.
DaringDerpy: like candle ja-wait nope not saying it!
/me installs fallout 3 goty
Kinixys: Science is about answering the questions we can. Religion is about answering the questions we can't. Or to put it another way, Science is about the how, Religion about the why.
Awwww shit the truth is going to reveal to the continue next yesssss WHOOP WHOOP!
Muffins!
Installation complete :)
I'll be in my lab then
What!?
doing science and science related stuff
have fun :)
Does this go here?

Sleep

Arcane_: When's said project due?

Arcane_: Project.

Is muffins an option?
Thats not what i wanted to do
Arcane_: I learned what it meant to be an adult when I was 16. It's about doing shit you don't want to do.
._.
I've got balls of rubber!
Is 8 a number?
SharkMane: nope it's a sideways symbol
Arcane_: Yeah, I know, I've been running ever since, haha

Wait if i wish to get a job then there going to get mad at me for getting it right?
Moopy: I don't think so...
Well then if i did i need a better computer
Wait i would be scared if i had a job like that
the computer is usualy not the problem if you can't stream. it's the internet
Moopy: why?
I don't know................i don't want to stream anything bad on the air
worried about people judging your streams?
well ummm..................

hmm well I that problem is easily solved by just doing utube requestis untill you find what best suits your audence ^_^

Pinkies sounds pissed off suddenly
Sumica...............you are so random
00,10eeeyup
cool
I speaky spanish :D
something about cleaning stuff
This is not a bad version at all.
German dubbing is horrible
Damn... I laughed.
I understand what they are saying, I prefer the English version
Aufhören!
wow that german art of dress sux
pony_2978: Germany is, sadly, notorious for poor dubbing and editing... the Zabuza in Naruto was especially infamous. The guy's whole thing was his giant sword-- the solution? Edit out the blade, so it looked like was attacking with a dildo.
See this is why i like you 2 guys Sumica and wrek you guys are my favorit guys on bronystate
00,10oh?
And I am NOT kidding.
eeyup
Kencolt: MLP was bound to be bad, because of all the songs
Been Dreamin' I've been waitin
who made this crap list?
RoboGerbil: Y9ou should hear the LOSERS.
CRAP!?
Kencolt: And I find it funny that so many people bitch about any dubbing of japanese anime other than anime, because most of the time they can not even have an opinion whether the japanese version is any good
so much ear rape
11,02Moo o3o
And this ain't bad-- sounds rightish anyhow.
MOooooooo
Mooooooo~
11,02O3O

00,10inb4 italian op gets number one
I USED to , years ago.
they should do something in romanian
or finnish
Sumica: Yeah-- if you're going to change things, thattime they did it GOOD>
I thought polish version would just be one dude speaking over the main audio, without any editing, lol
Fuck shit stack
saw this coming
The polish voices are nice
Yay, Poland-- GOOD Va there.
I really Like Frnch Flutterguy
ikr
AT THE GALA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
11,02!!!

The Poles treat the source material with respect. I like that.
WOOOOOOO
I love how absolutely random the italian opening is
can ya blame 'um sumi
What were they thinking
That's the opening for italian!?
so many spoilers in this opening
]THe italian opening is really good
00,10not realy a spoiler with out context
Well, that's one good way to come into Bronystate :D Hi guyyyys
still shows future scenes
00,10wrong one
In un mondo splendido - aaaand lag
the regular opening just has opening animation
er.. they call it anime?
anime just means animation
need link Sumica ?
In Italy, Anime means the same thing as in Japan-- ALL animation/cartoons.
YEAS
00,10hmmmm guess so
Kencolt: we just call anime "japanese cartoons"
I watched Avatar - The Last Airbender completely in italian
00,10cant seem to find the short opeing with lirics on local
I am glad only the first half of the first season sucked
oh was that the wrong one then Sumica ?
pony_2978: well, glad we don't suck :D
pony_2978: what was wrong with it? only the firt ep had animation errors
00,10wrong launage Spectrum_Rush
woops XD
for me the lowest part of the first season was the 2 part intro episodes
RoboGerbil: I really didn't like the first half, I don't even know why
Vola e va', my little pony, se nuovi amici vorrai incontrare
But the 2nd and 3rd season were MUCH better
And Toph alone was worth it, anyway
This intro dose feel a lot more like anime....
this the extended opening?
the avatar movie sucked ass
00,10there
XylemTube: No, for that this intro would need the Ponies running on a green field, and birds in the air
.... which is this?
XylemTube: And the mane 6 standing on the edge of a cliff, looking into the distance, hair flowing in the wind
SharkMane: the short opening they actually use
Holy-- it IS like an anime poening. It even had Random English.
wow steam really wants me to know X-COM is out
wishbone?
0h...
Whoa Amazing Stories
AMAXING STORIES.
Been a while since I've seen this
No telling WHAT we're going to see here.
Man, Dishonored has got a delayed release in europe...
could be anything.. even a pinkie ieacus
Sumica: we need some Crypt Keeper for Halloween! :D
Whatever we're gonna see is probably gonna be awesme
HELL YEAS!!!
swamp thing would be awesome right now
pony_2978: where are you from?
Ohhh this is this the one I missed because of my internet derping
MadSurge: Germany
thats a scary mummy...
...everything floats down here...
now question is... why would there be a zombie in a swamp
MAGIC!!!
pony_2978: Lots of german ponies here :) (I'm Italian though)
I'm part spanish!! :D
And the director is an ass. This is no surprise. I have directed a play once myself, and I was an ass.
00,10which part?
I did take italian in school
It comes with the territory.
00,10exposision time
Spectrum_Rush: why a MUMMY. A zombie is easy, a guy dies and rots in the swamp, tada! Zombie
lolz mummy
MadSurge: And now you know. BETTER STORY.
MadSurge: thats what i ment
00,10so a mut?
Him in that ridiclous getup. Its the same when Ricky Ricardo left the club in his voodoo witch dorctor getup when he heard Lucy was giving birth
Sumica: yeah basically
XD
J_E_Smith: yay I love lucy references :D
I DO know that my Great Great Grandfather was a railroad detctive, and helped catch the last man hanged in Georgia.
I'm half welsh and have kiwi :D
and I have some romani in there somewhere as well
who makes a sign like that?
OMG!! So real!!
mah mom
00,10I love this ep

Kencolt: some of them live in new zealand too ^_^

Kencolt: I know, but if this was real life they would do nothing :F

MadSurge, you've been brainwashed, you thought you won the lottery, but you didn't! :<

Dundun dundundun, DUN DUN DUN!

later alexxm

alexmm bye
go on...
Ah. ok. laters
Bye alexxm
I need to go forage some breakfast. brb
Ryunosuke: Go on...
There is death.
no, being a carnivore is wrong
I eat meat...
well there was that one time fluttershy fed fish to some otters or something :)
so do I
/me noms on ded chat all the time... But is not sure what ded chat is made of... :<
bicyclerepairman: then why did u say that?
I'm an omnivore. That's what my dna dictates I be. So it shall be.
/me sighs on... ded chat
cottno candy.
I swear if that bloody kid pisses me off again tomorrow I will beat his face in. He is lucky his back was turned and he had his bag on today. Or I wouldve done it when he stole my favorite pen.
cotton*
I don't know if that's an official position by PETA, but there are some sick people who give their pets vegan food
GREATSCOTTon candy
Gold_Demona: good job, you won the logic, /)
same here, I have fangs for a reason, it is not to tear apart lettuce leaves :)
That was abit eh
Plain
I hope PETA realizes raising pets can be animal abuse.
but you have the opportunity to change, Gold_Demona!
The word "carnivore" implies you eat nothing but meat and cannot digest plant material.
Gold_Demona: technically we can go on without meat, but meat is delicious :3
it's possible to not eat meat and survive, why don't you do it?
which brings be back to my philosophy: everyone needs to eat more bacon :)
Humans are omnivores.
^
^^
so?
Yeah, we can choose to eat just vegetables. That's called being a vegetarian, not an herbivore.
Being an herbivore means you physically cannot digest meat
bicyclerepairman: because it is scientificly proven to be an unhealthier lifestyle than just eating plants
Yep, we're still omnivores
your body still retains the dna and structure to eat and digest meat
Yeah
The last Vegitarian I saw was stupid and din't believe in evolution and belived the wprld was less than 10,000 years old.
But it's still possible to eat meat.
DoctoDoctorWho: what is?
TheRandomkid321: there's still peopl that believe the bible theory? :D
We are not herbivores or carnivores based on what we CHOOSE to eat. We are omnivores based on the fact that we CAN eat both meat and vegetables.
and it has been proven that your body obtains minerals from meat more efficiently than from plants
MadSurge Unfortunatle
supplements, Ryunosuke
its not IMPOSIBLE to live healthy without eating meat, but you better like eggs
bicyclerepairman, so you would eat a car?
Suddenly Phase4 :4
let me ask this
:<
DoctoDoctorWho: plants aren't fluffy and cute and can't look at you with big brown eyes
._.
I would if I could, Ryunosuke
do you drink milk? do you eat eggs? do you eat ANY bakery products what so ever? :0
So... WHO ELSE IS GETTING THE NEW XCOM GAME!?
Who brought up this topic?
if you dont like eggs then your stuffed
uhm, Ryunosuke... I said I ate meat
Some vegetarians don't like eggs AND milk. .-.
bicyclerepairman: neither can a mute blind man, does that make him okay to eat?
oh
he might be cute, DoctoDoctorWho
Dairy products, in general.
TheRandomkid321: I would, if my laptop was any good with more modern games :D
dairy products in general constitute meat products by relation
MadSurge Isn't it for Xbox 360?
bicyclerepairman: I think trees are cute, I still eat off them
Too
Spell-of-Gaming: Them's vegans. Not vegetarians.
you monster :O
:3
TheRandomkid321: you mean the shitty FPS or the strategy RPG?
Vegans go completely all out and don't even eat animal byproducts
I don't eat eggs I'm not into chicken periods
the bacon tree, BEST. EVER.
MadSurge Startegy RPG
Mmmmmm bacon
TheRandomkid321: it's also for PC
I don't think I could live if I couldn't eat bacon... And steak... and chicken... and cheeseburgers...
MadSurge But it's also for xbpox right?
If you think eggs are chicken periods, that's just the stupidest thing I have ever heard.
G'day all.
And baby back ribs...
Hi Tiberium126
I was joking
Night everypony got to hit the hey see you guys in the morning aight..............peace.
Do periods have babies?
Goodnight Moopy
No moopy :(
I like some good chicken wings
Spell-of-Gaming: Well, technically they are.
TheRandomkid321: I 'unno, I hate Xbox :D
Tiberium126: Guess what?!?!
sorry dude i have to go
Spell-of-Gaming Not all eggs have fetuses
DoctoDoctorWho, I love guessing games
Spell-of-Gaming: The chicken eggs we eat don't have baby chickens in them. Not even embryos.
later
0,2Meat is considered a required part of diet due to the need for protenes and iron which are incredibly dificult (if not imposible) to get from plants
Tiberium126: Im getting C&C 3 soon!
Oh god the colours.
They burn.
DoctoDoctorWho: :D
and now you know
Gold_Demona: just the nutrient necessary for the embryo
well, a period isn't an embryo as well
ohai Phase4
MadSurge: Exactly
:)
Colours! What is this madness Phase4? :<
okay let me ask this
but the... uh... cell... thingie is inside every egg
did manually so i would be noticed
Colors for mods are like canterlocks for luna
COLOURS! EVERYBODYN RURURURURURUN
Spell_of_Gaming: In order for the egg to have a baby inside, the egg would have to first be fertilized.
Phase4, I missed your blue text :3
Spell_of_Gaming: Generally, chickens that are farmed for eggs never see any roosters.
This topic..;_;
Phase4: you can get those proteins from animal byproducts
but it
Gold_Demona: except for when farmers need them to breed :D
's a problem for vegans*
Spell_of_Gaming: No rooster means no fertilized egg. Ergo, no baby.
MadSurge: Then they are farmed for breeding, not egg farming. :P
Ryunosuke: Ikr
Gold_Demona SHE HAS THE RIGHT IDEA!
Gold_Demona: chicken eggs are yummy
I love chicken eggs. :3
bicyclerepairman, exactly
I eat ALL THE CHICKEN PERIODS!
I'm gonna try the next vomit inducing challenge. eat a whole 6 pack of raw chicken eggs
you said meat though, not animal products ;-)
hello salmonela :)
Um, TheRandomkid321. You could DIE doing that.
Gold_Demona: well, they don't involve any blood, so it's not very gross :D
MadSurge: Eeyup :3
bicyclerepairman, its hard to get iorn from anything thats not red meat
Gold_Demona But rocky...
it's not that difficult, I looked that up for my gf once
Why don't you stream for us Phase4? Pwease? :3
TheRandomkid321: Who?
AdamTheDuck, streams free?
Gold_Demona: it's like dem idiots trying to eat spoonful of cinnamon
without suplements/vitamins?
indeed it is
TheRandomkid321: Dude, raw chicken has salmonella in it. That stuff can KILL you.
^
No Rw CHocken Eggs
Genius.
that is why we figured out how to use fire :)
TheRandomkid321: Raw eggs have it too
/me slaps AdamTheDuck around a bit with a large trout
And fish
It's sad to say, some athletes eat raw chicken eggs.
Oh...
Ew.
Gold_Demona: that's why Gordon Ramsey REALLY cares about chicken not being raw.
for example, beans, oats, spinach, walnuts etc
MadSurge: Exactly
I don't blame Ramsey for going rage mode over raw chicken.
Ah Ramsey.
So entertaining.
I don't even WATCH any of the shows he's in. I only know him by reputation. :P
Gold_Demona: at least he gets angry only at idiots in the kitchen :D
Tsk tsk
MadSurge: Exactly. He's not just being an asshole.
bicyclerepairman, the problem then is that too much of those items results in excessive diarhea, which is bad too
heh, true
MadSurge: I wouldn't wanna work in his kitchen tho. :P
i think that worked
O hey, a stream! :D
Stream is up Phase4 :P
that stream scared the shit outta me
Inb4 ded people due to music
Gold_Demona: also, he's a great cook first and a great showman later
eww Adam is playing
XylemTube, Success!
u suk Adam
/me licks Jmo :P
I hear Chrysalis :D
MadSurge: That's why I have a lot of respect for him. He really cares about what he serves on his plates.
Oh my god
Someone actually made a movie about the heads and tails of a coin
wa
lol
Well, I'd find that an interesting topic.
Rofl.
Is it like an actual MOVIE movie where the two sides are characters, or is it a documentary explaining why they're there?
The hell :D

Phase4: she's that badass
flutterspy?
Arrow through knee. Give up adventure. Fluttershy gets arrow through face. Gives no fucks.
Gold_Demona: so Skyrim is full of pussies
MadSurge: Exactly.
Gold_Demona: Of course, knee's are vital organs, face's arent
DoctoDoctorWho: Oh yeah. I forgot. 6_9
The knee is only one of the most unstable joints in the human body. :P
Gold_Demona: Im planning on getting my entire skeleton replaced with titanium
DoctoDoctorWho: Not adomantium?
Gold_Demona: sadly, I need real metals
MadSurge: I have no idea what either of those things are, but that's cool. XD

That was awesome.

Proper grammar detected, self destruct averted.
Y nopony leik Trixie?

Rainbow wins
seth pls go
Cuz Trixie's a beeatch? :P
So close.
YAY FOR YOU Phase4!
/me flips between Grammar Nazi and internet speak frequently
Gold_Demona: Ever consider that showing off and being dramatic was her special talent?
DoctoDoctorWho: That's not helping her case any. :P
damn tf2 being all "Not Responding"
She may have gone a LITTLE overboard with taunting the crowd, but she is just being herself!
Rofl
DoctoDoctorWho: Still not helping her case any. :P
A loveable showpony with a talent for illusion magic
showpony yes. Lovable no
Basically, it's RD's boasting gone all wrong
She oozes arrogance.
^
/me pats Gold_Demona
:)
That doesn't mean she can't get better, but in Boast Busters she's insufferable
Yeah
so should we all hate RD forever because she likes to strut her stuff and sometimes gets a bit carried away?
DoctoDoctorWHo: RD has redeeming qualities. Trixie didn't show any
None
pretty sure tf2 is going to crash on me
Crash all TF2s
You guys arent considering that she has more to herself than what she showed on stage, no second chances? no love? no tolerance?
I know there is a good pony behind all those fireworks and ego boosts, I can see it.
DoctoDoctorWho: If she proves herself as anything other than the arrogant bitch she was through the entire episode, then sure. But as of yet, she has not shown ANY qualities that suggest there are any good intentions in her.
trixie and gilda are some of the best antogonists in the series
I dont have anything agaisnt trixie per se
She didn't seem that nicer when she was in her wagon, DoctoDoctorWho :|
Gilda I hate with a burning passion
she is a showmare, her JOB is to exagerate
which makes Gilda a great antogonist
Gold_Demona: one of s3 episodes will be about them trying to be better :D *speculation*
DoctoDoctorWho: If she showed ANY good qualities at all in the episode, I must've missed them. I don't just mean on stage. I mean at all ever the entire time she was on screen.
no spoilers
MadSurge: I know Trixie's supposed to make a comeback, but I saw nothing about Gilda.
I said *speculation*, DeadpoolDash :D
/me slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
Damn clone
She obviously puts her show face on when her "fans" are around, otherwise she loses stage credibility.
speculate is very close to spoiler if there were any leaked scripts/overviews
If we saw her on vacation or on the road, she would almost definitly be different
If Trixie's character is improved in her next appearance, then that's cool. But from everything I saw in the one episode she appeared in. She's just an arrogant bitch.
osnap.
DeadpoolDash: that's it then, no evidence found of that yet
Gold_Demona: she's certainly fairly powerful, but Twilight is this much above her
DoctoDoctorWho: It seems to me your judgement on Trixie is based on the tragedy the fanon has built around her.
This argument is getting a little overboard...
I'm just going by what I saw in the episode.
Gold_Demona: silly fandom, Trixie is for kids :D
MadSurge: :D
MadSurge: k, that was good. Ill give you that.:D
Ok, gotta cook some pasta, be back later :P
kk
But Im just trying to be more open to speculation instead of writing her off like pinkie initialy did with gilda, while gilda truly DID prove to be a bitch, we have no further evidence that trixie is any worse than we saw.
DoctoDoctorWho: We also have no proof that she's any better either. =/
Gold_Demona: thats what I mean!
I AM BEST PONAY.
Arguement settled.
Jmo is best pony. Ineed.
wd
DoctoDoctorWho: Bottom line. I'm not gonna like her unless I see some ACTUAL redeeming qualities,
Not speculation
indeed*
Wuts goin on?
Judgemental jelousy pants...
wait wut
Dovah and DoctoDoctorWho are two people?
WTf
With fictional characters. If a character never actaully shows redeeming qualities, then they don't have any.
Jmo: yeah
Then
Oh my god wut.
Jmo, that's why I asked why you were talking to dovah :$
Cause I saw Dovah as DoctoDoctorWho before.
Jmo: DoctoDoctorWho was just at my house this weekend
Righto.
Well I have to leave bye everypony
Bye DoctoDoctorWho
kk
laters
see you at school DoctoDoctorWho
I've been lied to.
;_;
You lai Adam.
Poor Jaymoo D:
/me makes Jmo some tea :<
/me gives Jmo a muffin
tea sounds good right now.
Buut we're out of milk. fml
/me licks Jmo :<
So much ded in chat :/
I blame you.
one more map then i need to do stuff
That's because most of the chat was the Trixie debate, and that died when the opposing party left the chat. :P
I was having fun, too.
That was a good debate
I still don't agree with him, but he made some valid points.
Dat cough laugh
/me pats Gold_Demona
lol, I bought Pok?mon Black 2 and White 2 on Amazon yesterday, and I just got the shipping confirmation today. Current location: US
WOW, Amazon! That's REALLY specific!
Nice to know EXACTLY where my package is, lol! :D
That's the reliable Amazon we know and love. :D
Huzzah for specific tracking.
/me slaps AdamTheDuck around a bit with a large trout
Oi you're Australian
:<
But I buy books sometimes from Amazon... :<
What books?
I buy lots of things from Amazon.
You better not be buying 50 Shades of Grey.
Lol no XD
Mostly because I can spend the reward points on my credit card on there.
Goliath by Scott Westerfeld
AHAHAHA that book was on the table one day at lunch time when I went home from school for lunch, so i took it back and read it in English
>my teachers face when
I might the whole Leviathan series :P
What a cool kid.
No, Jmo. He's buying Twilight
FFFFF
Ikr Jmo
/me slaps AdamTheDuck around a bit with a large trout
Wait you read FSOG
My god
GAAAAAY
Jmo, reading what now?
man I LOVE this song
Phase4, Fifty Shades of Grey.
50 Shades of Grey
Applejacks Theme is the best
i have no idea what that is
Phase4, :O
o_o
and hi everyone :)
Hiyo Lil_B
And ohai Lil_B~ :P
Took 45 minutes to download the files to get into the server.
We love you too Jaymoo :D
Applejacks theme is how I started 2012, had it running thoughout New Years Eve
xcept Gold_Demona
Except*
Cause she makes good strips.
AdamTheDuck Canada + New Zealand :P
ARE YOU SORRY?
:<
O_o
Oh god I just joined, don't switch.
ffff
XD
Damn spycrabs.
pretty sure i am going to time out since TF2 is not responding
How's the water Phase4
Jmo, cold
:P
Oh GOD LORD! YES!
Somebody made A Lossless Rip of Earthbound! *falls to his knees, chacking and crying*
ew invisible boss.
Lil_B, the nes game?
Phase4 the SNES game
cause if so that toom em a while
close enough
i could rip one of those easy
Phase4 yeah, I guerss most people where just pleased with the regular mp3s :/
Vinyl Scratch rocks to hard because she's not a mortal pony - :) I have Tenacious D stuck in my head
Oh, the music
thats a smidge harder but not that hard
Lil_B, the original stuff is 'chiptunes', as in it is litteraly instructions for a chip
zomg octavia keeled you
Lul
Phase4 the SNES already used samples
Lil_B, interspliced with the sound chip
it could not have stored full music
16bit memory buss, it couldnt address a small mp3
let alone play one
Phase4 it used Trackers, or Midis
I thought they didn't do that until the age of Playstation
Phase4 it didn't had the Mp3, it just stored the order in which they were played+ additional modulations
the samples were playxed*
lolz at the Spike VA playing Fighting is Magic
dem midis
I used to collect midis
shhhh
i chose rainbow dash as next boss
:3
lol XD
Lil_B, point is it wasn't stored as pcm
you cant play back an actuall lossless copy with any normal player
unless your using vlc but its better than normal
Good morning
Morning Ponies47 :3
Hiyo Ponies47
VLC is so awesome!!!
^
No way, WMP is the bomb.
awww
i wasnt next
I use Xion for my music
I'm thinking about switching to eather Foobar or just using VLC for my music too though
well tf2 is being dumb right now so that enough for me
WMP isn't bad once you got all the Codecs, has some neat features to get your music ordered, but it has still too many faults imo compared to others
Oh bollocks.
You and your RD Phase.

Cypresswolf: stab stab stab
Gold_Demona: Ikr :(

Spectrum_Rush: how much pony do you have?
RoboGerbil: Yep
yeah, tell us of your swag so we can be jealous of it. :D
/me Is an idiot. He should of bought a plushie at Canterlot Gardens
lol adjustments
Gold_Demona: I got a few Pony munchkin-like cards :3
lol that plush isnt very cooperative
munchkin-like? O.o
ok fine Wrek I have 3 Rainbow dash plushes, Princess Luna, Nightmare night Derpy, and one of my oc
so what are those symbols at the bottom?>
Gold_Demona: you know what Munchkin is?
Clean room? Pfft, the floor is best shelf
MadSurge: Yeah
Cypresswolf: So true :P
RoboGerbil: Wrek putting Pegi symbols relating to his stream :D
Spectrum_Rush: I ish jelly. I want one of my OC. D:
I saved... and they weren't that expensive >_><_<
^
Wrek: Like a baws. Like a baws.
08,01how was Canterlot Gardens?
08,01i heard some bad rumours about it
Plushies are too expensive for me - customs and actual toys, not so much
Maybe I could get a custom made of my OC instead. :P
Gold_Demona: at BUCK they were selling the character cards for this upcoming Munchkin-like game with ponies :3
would like a Gilda plush, if I had the $ to buy one :)
Gold_Demona: why dont you just make your own oc as a plushie? it cant be that hard...
08,01Ponies47: seriously?
08,01MadSurge: holy shit!
08,01how did i miss that?!
08,01i fucking love Munchkin!
Dat Tomska
Gold_Demona: try etsy my oc one was only $55
Spectrum_Rush: Oh wow, that's almost a reasonable price :$
Spectrum_Rush: Aaaaaand that's why I don't have one yet. T^T
-lol
I can't justify spending 55 bucks on a toy...
^
Not with mortgage and car payments to make
08,01$55?!
08,01that's fucking cheap
^
08,01that's like... £35
well then I shouldn't mention how much the others costed
08,01Spectrum_Rush: linky to plushie maker?
/me is somewhat insane
08,01Spectrum_Rush: also, linky to the plushie you got?
It's a good price for a custom, but I can't justify it. T^T
O.O
Spectrum_Rush: Same for me. Link to both pwease? :3
Wow. We're really getting into the TomSka lately
Dumb cops are dumb. XP
08,01MadSurge: by next year, i might be into MTG
08,01we should play that
:D
As silly as this is, I think it makes more sense than ASDF
08,01MadSurge: Magic: The Gathering
Ah
Pokemans is betr
^
^^
:P
I have even less idea how to play that though :D
Inb4: Eddsworld will be streamed later
MTG is easy to learn, hard to master
08,01Jmo: gtfo
Naww
08,01:P
I collect all of them.
there are only 2 basic rules to MTG, Rule on the cards, and LIFO
Oh those awkward moments
Guns, guns everywhere
/me 08,01lies on MadSurge
08,01i'm a monstrous monster
what are we watching?
that being said, the hardest part of mastering MTG is deck building.... like childrens card games on motercycles :)
^ XD
Card games on motorcycles!!!!
/me misses his thallid deck and his ice age elf deck :)
This isn't working!
antiquities was fun too
hi

Er, two major copyrights

MadSurge: Never heard of it, but it sounds cool. =)

Oh he was going to sleep

Gold_Demona: Yes and no.
Gold_Demona: It taste better with egg
MadSurge, this game you pointed me to is published by Atlus. It looks like it's just their attempt to cash in on the Pokemon craze by making a spinoff of SMT that's more kid friendly
Gold_Demona: But you dont need it to make french toast.
Kandarihu: exactly
