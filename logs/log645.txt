To kill? o.o
end/sever/etc
its really up to anybodys preferance
I like romance D:
and i said that i think its good that its hard to kill
Unfortunately i prefer old style romance, something women dont fully appreciate anymore =_=
honestly, its like people take things out of context on purpose or something...
Wait, people don't do that anymore?
Many woem ni know dont expect such things.
its shame, its like chocolate is a poor choice for close quarters romance or something...
*women
o.o
Saturn, oh you. :D
You never cease to get out of my attension spotlight :D
Classy gentlemen, something that has been lacking in today's society. :3
Yep yep
*she

well you guys, later, school is moaning my name in a very unerotic fashion

But, a lot of people initially complained that the objects were outlined like this.

oh, okay then

Saturn: ahhh, right. Where did you go? I've been out of the loop for a time

08,01not at all!
pfff, there is no awkward in here
hahaaha
that is a condition you hsould change
00,02huh
00,02really want to
00,02XD
Good ol' rule 63
00,02its the name
mine jsut needs upgrades. mainboard, cpu, ram and graphics card
Makes sense to me.
you dont need 16
8 are completely sufficient
my Xbox 360 has over 100+ gigs storage available
thats why I didn't get 16, but I do editing
00,02thats too far back
00,02i meen wouldnt be hard
WE MUST GO BACK FORWARD
TO THE FUTURE
00,02but meh
00,02ONWARD
:o
08,01from nokw on, when people ask my gender, ill just say "tree"
I insulted you, didn't I saturn?
:D
08,01gender: curry
just say futa
I apologiza.
08,01ofna01: of course not!
^
This part was a bit creepy to me.
skullfuck
08,01futa is best gender
o_o
o.o
bomb has been planteed
LOL
Hahaha
O.o
actually, saturn is right. think about it. every living form has the ultimate goal of reproducing to ensure it'S species survival. biologically, the ideal geneder
...then again, that would probably throw natuaral population controll out the window
futa is both genders isnt it?
yes
08,01futa is best of both worlds
I obtain breakfast, come back, and find this topic...how silly of you lot
Females with dicks, right?
08,01two sets of fun parts to play with
/me grabs his stomach and covers his mouth
:D
You never cease to make me half-vomic-half-chuckle Saturn :D
^
00,02what am i suposed to do?
...i dont see the problem...
00,02theres a thing
00,02the glass thing
00,02should have picked up a laser rifle
08,01eachmeh, each to their own
00,02dat malformed text
00,02or not malformed
00,02windows has screwy fonts
been a while sicne i did that
08,01Koen says that those of you saying "eew" are probably secretly into it anyway :P
LOL
._.
Haha I remember those statistics
quite probably
00,02Dark92Enigma, already did that though
I lol-ed
00,02tab fail
it would probably throw me off a bit, to see a mans face with womans breasts....
wrong button
Pffft, I like my women with their normal genitailia :D
same
thatw as easy
08,01ofna01: cant beat chicks with dicks.
:D
Saturn, I'll stick with the girlfriend I have now.
XD
BUTTONS!
poosh booton
there's also a D button
Saturn: Nice mental image you gave me there :D Best of both worlds, eh?
meh
Basically, you either expose one of the bad groups, or kill yourself.
boom button
i pressed that
DA BOOM BUTTON
not as spectacular as you might think
right button is desabled becasue you didnt speak to taggart
00,02the darrow button seems closest to the truth
00,02Dark_Horst, i know, it disapoints me :(
00,02middle button
00,02because its in the middle
00,02ofna01, yeah

00,02ofna01, i've got the launcher

i swear it would kick me off at least once every 30-60 minutes

but at least you get some input in this... xenosaga you watch 45 min of movie before you can do anything
but not even that I can confirm, sorry :/
oh well worth a shot
That's weird, what's with the gameplay mechanics?
how many cut scenes does this have
?
alexxm*
the only SOLIDER is shinra
Nooo, Buzz Buzz, you only lived for 9 mintues!
00,10every ff has had active time battle
00,10it's was at one point an option
00,10Sup
&cc
hows it going?
*cc
It's difficult for people to say why they don't like FFXIII. I have yet to hear a good, simple explanation :P
no seriously, the only anmes i know are from a movie...
names*
00,10nah just have not been chating
08,01sumica!

Well that doesn't make any sense.......:S
Who's streaming?
well
Saturn: Nice.
i has a bannana bag
His voice is different all of a sudden
00,10they were added for the US version
me jelly saturn
00,10long time ago dont recall the site any more
And by weapons you mean the utlimate weapons right?
00,10yeah
If you ever want to do something amusing, try actually mapping out a standard plot-railed FPS map, and trying to figure out how it would work IRL
Ember: my m16
still, ff7:cc was pretty linear too but the combat system was fun, and the story was amazing
Hello, meow.
00,10ruby, saphire, ultmate, they were only ever seen in the cutscenes
00,10there were not any kind of side boss
meow, right.
at least this game's not as bad as Stairfax Temperatures
Eh, good, but the statue's getting a bit dusty.
i has a piano
Hey everypony
hi

Huh. You think it would of been the other way around. Japan getting the extra bosses and us not.

08,01heh, we'd be eating pussy...
Saturn: :D
Saturn: Oh you! :P
Saturn: dohohohohohoh

Saturn I <3 horrible puns and jokes XD
Ember i don't know
I actually have ffxIII for ps3
=.(\
But I can't get past one bit
2,14 yeah, hard because they beef up all the monsters and expect you to use strategies they never teach you
Hey guys
first! /)^3^(\
good evening!§
:p
2,14 because I must have missed that tutorial
Hey everpony?
FF 13 ?
Has there been any epic drawing recently that I missed out on?
*japanese
sucky motto
Has there been any epic drawing recently that I missed out on?
Time Eater

real heroes dont need plans?
reeeaaal heroes dont have brains!
real hero's do this
Ember: Real heros goes up and hits
LEEEEEEEEEEROY JEEEEEENKINS!!
WTF
2,14 you don't even get exp until later
nice music though
then why have them
real heros fight like men and put up fists
(hidden reference there)
did Uematsu do the music in this one?
then they proceed to die of radiation, get revived and free some kroe wastelabd
*more
mkay
It took me about 40 hours to get to the part where it get's nearly impossible while playing FFxii
the battles in this FF were kind of easy
2,14 FF online doesn't exist and should never be mentioned
Yeah sure, it had flaws, but still enjoyable
FFXI....? <.<
FF online? whats that? 6_9
i saw the ad for ff online, and now that i think about it, i havent heard a thing about it since then
Ember: FFXI. It was an MMO
Hey look cannon fodder
And isn't FFIV supposed to also be an MMO?
owait, or am i thinking about ff14
Is this one of those newer FF games?
MOMS ARE BADARSE
well I have to go now
just ask ellen ripley
ciao
well, ive seen other kinds of moms
yeah, give the gun to the little girl
;)
BAD GIRL
running away from spiders
yes, give the assault rifle to the little girl
ALL UNITED
motivational speach was not very effective
and then the little girl shot them all in the back as a joke
give 4 year old childeren guns! good idea!
VANILLE YOU SUCK
and then the little girl tripped and splattered her brains over all of the other kids
music is repetetive too
*repetitive
2,14 at least Tidus was supposed to be annoying
Ember: /me
2,14 Vanille is just something you want to throw down a meat grinder
vanille is the girl rite? i thought she was cute :3
because of course gangsta style always works
problem is, i only have a wii and a ds at home...
well i'm outta here
IF THERE WAS NO Tidus, there would be no Balthier, I'm certain of it :P
are those stnadart military issue?
hm, that thing seems to have a cool design
wich one do you guys reccomend?
Cause FFX created the style of FFXII
owait
AURON is also a good character
BAD ARSE MOMS
ded
BAD ARSE MOMS Are also....dead..
awkward pose
SHE ISNT EVEN HURT!
weeeeee
NOTHING HIT HER! NO INJURIES!
WE ALL STAND Uni...ted..?
Well feck
Perhaps not THAT united.
still no injuries
She's...dead...
ded
yes, but STILL NO INJURIES
free falling!
and then everyone died. The End
2,14 FORCED EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT ON PEOPLE WE DON'T KNOW NOR CARE ABOUT
bitch slap
tough choise
I don't even know that mother's name. But it was practically a worf effect there.
The thing is.
There's CRAPTON of story in this
It just starts WITHOUT and introduction ><
2,14 there's a crap ton of information, not story
2,14 piling on tons of info is not a story
LIGHTING IS PLAYED BY KRISTEN STEWART
MECH INC
2,14 >implying Skyrim has much of a story
Well, it's exposition.
you never did
theres the war going on in skyrim
oh i know her problem
Ember: I know, it's just that she's not really memorable.
how the fuck did he survive
And the whole backstory was told in a MASSIVE infodump that gave players multiple quicksaves through it all.
DIE DIE VANILEE DIE
<.<
VANILLE
It's Aerith and Rikku's lovechild!
i guess its pretty hard, to act emotionless as VA
*so far
Kingdom heart?
nvm
i know him from a movie
Well that was convinient
