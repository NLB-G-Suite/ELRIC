flutterchu: I personally am trying to not distract Wrk in teh middle of an SCII matchup

IIRC, the guy who's voice we're hearing isn't the streamer.
tSparx: atleast i know who's streaming

A lot of people who saw the parody, icnluding me, assumed that was a RD dupe account, but it's actually meant to be scootlaoo
00,10give the attention whoreing a break
Lyra`: ummmmmmm............)_)

i don't get how people can type that fast
no we couldnt
id rather not Sumica
its quite fun my friend
derp
:P
well than you will get banned and give this place a break derp
hey, derp is fun to say
Wrek: You are correct
yes, we could not hear you
its all fun and game till someone gets the derpies
00,10I have no problem with removeing you again lyra
AGH frozen again
brb

rainobw dash:huh now CAREFUL derpy

and suddenly tSparx had no stream at all
tSparx: Neither do I.

-_- My internet is messed up
i'm just in the IRC >_>
its a pretty stream, very clean, and filled with fresh fish :3

ryaxnb_: Wrk's doing SCII

top google hit
Okay, I'm going on an adventure.
but it could also be soul calibrur II!
ryaxnb_: Yep yep

skies of arcadia was a fun game

LINKING TIME http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8PMq8tovA0
Lyra`: Speaking of great oldschool RPGs
wrek so silly with his tech issues
00,10he could have his problem fixed if he checked PM's
matt: grab what you need and lets get out of here
05Sumica
05i did
05but i forgot what i need to set them to
05can you year my voice?
Wrek, im going to have a comissin for you on the 18th :3
00,10nope
05i take the silence as a no
051 sec
I thought I heard something for an instant
same
I hear some skipping....
grab what you need and lets get out of here
00,10should not need to change any of the settings you had from this morning
so what are the differences between the "@, %, and +"
what did you think of that video
Wrek~ im the ghost of starcraft past, i will show you all of your starcraft sins
05Sumica: i cant recall what the repeaters were set as
Ponymon-Anarchy, Op, half-op, and voiced.
00,10reppeter mme is set to line 1 in line 2 out
explain Polydunami|PS
00,10set fmle to listen to line 2 when streaeming
dat ping o_O
is Sumica streaming?
00,10no
Wrek is
05hmm
shit
Wrek is ______
Glorious
Ponymon-Anarchy: @ or OP is a channel Operator, % or halfOP has OP abilities, but less channel acess generally, + or voice can talk in +m rooms
Ponymon-Anarchy: It's indicative of your role in the channel. @=mod/chan-ops, %=pseudo-mod/half-chan-ops, and +, which means that when the chan-mode is +m (muted), the + peeps can still talk
dat fast typing
handsome, cute, funny, witty, smart, huggable, adorable, talented, strong, fast, magic, and a friend
it be back!
seems legit
So either we hear Wrek or the other guy.
matt: grab what you need and lets get out of here
anyone know when Allegr0 and gigabit come back?
Wrek oh oh ya heard black mesa source is going to be mostly released in four days on september the 14th?
flutterchu: You say that all the time, what is that?
Anyone in here have 2 extra spy, medic, soldier, or scout items?
tSparx: i wish i can link you but no video's during stream
I can hear both of you.
evidently you should keep talking
and randomly talking
yay! two people

13Sumica: nah she's not quite as annoying as short round
http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/35f1ii/
yay?
Azureflames901: Yup. Yay.
13aug'd men can't jump
He does:D
my god he jumps low
With all the augments...
lol he prolly does weigh a ton
13i think i shot down that door
He can if he gets a jump augment
Shizuka :< Violence is not the answer.
13it is in this game
Nooooo
Maybe all those augments make him too heavy?
I personally play it without killing anyone.
13"i took a detour malik, hint hint"
Shizuka: how come you post 6 messages in a row and don't get bann-----Oh you're a mod, OF F***ING COURSE :D
You would think they could hear him
http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/2sme/
Sorry
So this is a whore house basicly?
No
but there aren't any ponies
It's a hotel where young women meet with rich men to engage in business matters.

Many profitable deals are turned each day.
DerpyMuffins: "Gentlemen club"
boom headshot
13oblivious, party of four, your brothel is ready
/me sees empty lines in the chat window
These are some stupid AIs
13i love moving bodies while cloaked, everyone flips out
Hello Shizu :)
0,14iirc, they actually seel official replicas of his jacket
we just want some alone time
Coming to a brothel with no money/credit cards?
13ded
Ghosts man
Dem ghosts
6Hi again ^^
13protip sumica you can left click throw while moving them :3
kick him
nooooooooo
13:)
SaxyPretender: Gotta level with you, man. Jensen's jacket is just cooler than yours. Sorry.
0,14I am not denying htat
13deeeeed
If I could have Jensen's jacket...
No
That isn't quite right.
Here, I'll demonstrate.
Sumi: If you needed to shoot something, why not the whole club? :P
I really couldn't get into this game.
If I could have Jensen's shades...
/me peeks into chat.
Deeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaad
Argh
/me 13pounces canary canary~
Deeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaad
Eeep!
Hiya Shizu <3
13:3
Lemme guess...this a Sumi stream? :o
13niiiiiice
130.4 to spare
hey
The best part is that Jensen's coat is actually modified so that his snazzy arm blades/skin-planted bomb launchers don't rip it.
It is the coolest coat ever.
Why yes it is!!!! Hiya Sumi :3333

woah cabbage for 99 cents/bits/whatever they have in China
6Same..I haven't had any for 2 years though.. ._.

00,02y u no bug
aww :(
China's running on the yuan, iirc
Candybars?
lol
13you hit them in the head sumica, they only have like 1hp
:kickcount
Reikim|GW2: This command requires at least 1 parameters.
00,02theres a timeout bug in BerryPunch
the trashcan is evil
:kickcount Reikim
Reikim|GW2: Reikim has been kicked 3 times
00,02but now i'm monitoring it, the bug isnt happening
yey
dat timing
It's the same reason, Phase, that water never boils while you look at it.
I'm back
13i dunno i lethal TKOd those two last run, no one eeeeever looks there
You have to turn your back for water to boil.
BRB
0,14Phase4, clearly it's a quantum bug
00,02XD
its suprising how many people don't know that activision is
It's called "the universe is being a snarky bastard and is screwing with you".
fire.
6:O
13last run i killed everyone in the hive club after finishing tong's thing
Ohhh my
You must really hate the Hive, Shizu.
13and then malik wanted to do her side quest, so here's a guy getting a lap dance in a club full of bodies
Can't fathom why, though.
U,m
Um
Who's playing?
That's weird
im screwing around on omegle and apparently theres alot of people that don't know
At the very beginning, when I was searching through the desk and stuff, the lady would not shut up about hurrying me out the door. My first time I just wanted to kill someone
Perhaps he's a necrophiliac?
Then when I DID leave, I found out there was a toy car. I was so angry.
13time to take out the adorable trash
/me Returns
Sumica: let go of that trashcan or your shins
The one time I broke down was in Hengsha, when you track down that Orpheus guy.
Or whatever he's called.
6:O
Shizu is silliest filly.
At Sbarros, I actually came up with a little song. "I'm the trashman! ... Taking out the trash! You put this thing there and that thing here. All of these things Go In The Trash! Because I'm the trashman. Taking out the trash."
13my physics are augmented
What question should I ask for spy mode?
I honestly tried my hardest to take down the enemies non-lethally. I honestly did. But then I got fed up with it, sat in a shadowy corner, and just sniped them with my handgun.
13i think you reach that fence from the other side, there's a different one with a hole at the ground
Insermountable Knee High fence
dat game crash
no wait
It's rather depressingly amusing to see the AI see a body, wander over it, look around, get shot in the face...and then see another enemy do it right after.
he just aint moving
Can't tell if stream lag or Sumica tabbed out.
Sumica: dont you just love that?
In fact, this entire game is full of really depressing stupidity.
Reikim|GW2: I played maybe 3 hours and quit. I'll come back to the game if I get bored
6Spy mode?
It's the AI. It's really easy to manipulate.
I think by the end I had something like fifteen bodies piled on the same exact point.
13the high jump aug isn't terribly worthwhile
Maybe you can stand it on it's end?
never mind lol
Take the Landing System as soon as you can, because there's nothing more embarrassing than death by ground.
fly aug?
13there's lots of invisible walls once you have the high jump too
Hulk Smash!
Can't climb that recycle bin?
Is this back in Detroit?
Near the police station?
13hengsha rei
Hm
I don't remember anything like that in Hengsha
Don't jump up, bring it down to you! :P
13heee rooooode a blazing dumpsterrrr
/me opens stream despite himself
13he wore a shining star (?)
Do you even have a goal? Like you're sightseeing
13has the main quest and a side mission going
Is this fantasy or real?
You can get extras?
What is real?
What?
I don't remember that.
Buy Jump Augment
Jump Augment is useless, take the x-ray vision and the wall-punch for tons of fun.
Imagine being that one poor mook.
You're just patrolling along, going about your day, feeling like a big man with your gun and your swag.
Suddenly, a METAL HAND comes punching through the wall, and breaks your neck.
Embarrassing way to die.

Jensen is duke nukem
Hey Cypresswolf you went to the convention?
ummmm....yes
Early.
Yeah.
MrMalk: :) Yep
Go Go Gadget X-Ray
When you ahve to get back up at six in the morning, early and late kind of tend to shift a bit.
Sumica: 4
Cypresswolf I couldnt go because my grandfather was getting surgery
MrMalk: I found Barbetos & AJIsAwesome at the opening ceremonies - AJ informed us about that - I'm sorry, is he ok?
Magic cake is good for you.
Question: Are there any timed missions, past the first mission?
Cypresswolf ya he should be they finished 2 hours ago
MrMalk: :) thats good to hear
Cypresswolf hes stable hopefully hes better now
MrMalk: I'll keep him in my prayers
Cypreswolf thanks
:) Your Welcome
Hope you got some pictures of the convention
0,14no snakes in there, Sumica?
I want to talk about everything, but dont want to spoil the stuff Barbetos & AJ may want to talk about :)
Sumica: not enough
so close
Cypresswolf ok you guys will tell me when your all here
Sumica: you need another dumpster
MrMalk: I'll try to stay silent til then :)
Also, why the HELL does it take battery power to lift/melee in this game?
Cypresswolf "TRY
Keyword
lol
I will say, the drinking ponies panel I was most looking forward was canceled just before Whooves Line ended - :D Like the hotel staff was tipped of "They're going to do WHAT? "
D'OH!
13oh wow there is stuff up there
Sumica: there is another way I'm sure
Should have gotten jump upgrade Sumica
MrMalk: there is no jump upgrade
ill be right back
I NEED TRASH "I'm sorry, what?"
MrMalk: there's a falling upgrade though
otakon Augment
upgrade/augment
/me sneaks up and glomps Shizuka
same difference
otakon yes there is Im pretty sure
13eep
But hey - Drink with Barbetos - Check! :) had some whiskey in my room before calling it a night
kirzstryfe: why do you keep glomping her?
same reason I do this
/me noms on otakon
kirz! ;3
Sumi finally make it to the ledge. Finds out it is a dead end.
/me bearhugs kirzstryfe until he hears bone cracking noises
/me pulls LadyCanary into the Shizu-glomp
I must know what's up there.
You drank with barbetos Cypresswolf?
:D YAAAAAY
Still have plenty of my Gentleman Jack left for the stream friday night :)
/me glompsels into kirzstryfe s glomp pile
/me spins

Mica: What are you going to do if it wasnt worth it at all?
ill be leaving mr streamer why are you always so offensive?
oooo deus x hello everypony
Jack Daniels every mans best friend Cypreswolf :)
MrMalk: Eeyup! Though I think I out drank him on account I had one cup while I waited for him to finish the Whooves Line panel :P
lol
13all that for stun gun pieces you can't even fit
Tootaly worth it
just move some stuff to the bottomleft
*Totally
Sumica: you should get a TARDIS style inventory
Managing your inventory in Deus Ex is a whole game in and of itself.
13just throw a grenade, no one will notice
Cypresswolf I thought we where waiting for story time
but the strippers are already stunning
lol
As for cosplay pictures - I didnt take much, but I did get one of a Star Swirl the Bearded with a Twilight Sparkle :) I hope that picture comes out ok

hello everyone
Alright. I'm not seeing the stream.
There's a stream, right?
And the lovely art of me and Shizu >w>
hi flutterchu
13<3
No color Nittany_Discord?
I got one of Madmax's comics at BronyCon, she really is quite the talent.
hi flutterchu
Not in the color mood.
Jersey Shore's cancelled. Now people's brain cells can grow back
^
something wrong Nittany_Discord
I actually never encountered any glitches in etd
11,01No.
11,01Here.
any game breaking glitches i mean
lol
11,02Anyway, for those who haven't read the post on the site, Madmax is in some financial difficulty after an earthquake struck her apartment. Luckily, she's alright, but her apartment is another story. She'll be doing a stream which we're featuring on our site right now to help her raise some money to get by this tough time. She's an amazing artist who helped to make the BronyState banner
JESmith71: jersey shore got cancelled?
11,2you know and experience on our site.
11,01But I'm about to go to bed. May watch a bit of this stream.
:\
Madmax
On Bronystate
And streaming
Whelp, there go my plans to go to bed early
is the stream on now? or is my computer be retarded?
11,02In a minute, the stream will be up. We're restreaming her Livestream channel due to the viewer caps she has on her channel.
the first time i play it, the enemies had sticks, but it they were kinda glitchy and their sticks stretched off into infinity lol
11,01Lol.
6:O
isssssssssss there a stream?

not yet
Buffer channel atm
Whelp, there go my plans for an early night.

CrimsonPhoenix: I wouldn't say that, but I DID work at a laser tag arena the summer "Everytime we touch" was popular. So yeah...I've developed a bit of animosity towards the song :D
crazypony: already said it first
Spectrum_Rush, I didn't get pinged by SuperBrony64 :S
now I'll forever hate this piece for how much it makes me think of another song without being it

Even though he typed my username
*sigh* why is it always twilight

Oh well, it's nothing to worry about.
cause it makes me think of how lazy it is, how insulting it is.
wished it was RD
Polydunami: id say its cause of his color script but... well idonno
Probably
Petrified_Discord, if you make another sond that is be to be different in title BUT has similar beat to one of your highest succes.

Hi everypony :)

The look on Optimus's face... "Do you mind, Autobots? I'm am reading the GOOD Twilight novel".
Even if they can mute when they have anything actually important to say. <3
Dat optimus prime
AppleDash: mods use the colors to talk when its needed
/me Hugs MadMax tightly "aahh you poor thing i love the banner so much"

The only things I like but never drink are Coke and Tea.
I could drink room temp milk if I lived in an igloo.
I can't drink anything room-temperature. Either it's freezing cold or boiling hot.
Nope, I meant inject. :3
Ghosties for the next time years you will only drink fresh milk from the cow

hi Silver_Spoon
0,14XD
ello Silver_Spoon
Silver_Spoon: Hi! :)
Hi Silver_Spoon
confound target for running out of mlp cards :|
Why can I never find any pony merch? Hopefully the Target opening next spring will sell it, but the Zellers it's replacing didn't carry pony merch and I can't walk to our only Wal-Mart
Canadian_Brony, yeah we get target in canada now! bye bye zellers...
It will not be missed
right?
agreed
00,10dat magic blending tool
I never cared for zellers
zellers was poorly ran
Basenji, its a canadian target-like store
04God, Max is so flippin' talented
what are Zellers?
Ghosties: ikr!?
target has so much buying power, the prices will be better than zellers.
I don't have any MLP paraphernalia. :P What should I buy first?
thelonepony, zellers is the canadian equivalent to target
thelonepony a store up here in Canada that's going out of buissness
Target bought out all the zellers
Klumzeedragon para-what?
is this SAI?
oh
00,10blind bags are a good place to start
it was quite funny when i was at target and someone called to ask if they carried cod: mw4 :D
though i did catch the closing sale at the zellers here had some ok deals
Sumica, whats the deal with blind bags?
just a random toy or what?
00,10random in a sence yes
6xD
Canadian_Brony: It means equipment and stuff like that. Usually used in terms with drugs. :D
OMG is that a DS?
Brad_: what's a blindbag?
MrMalk eeyup
04Seems that way, MrMalk
flutterchu, thats what I asked
:P
00,10you can know what toy it is by the code stamped in to the back of the bag
Sumica, are there some that are more rare than others or something
Canadian_Brony: call of duty modern warfare 4 :D
00,10but that is only if you know what code is for what toy
00,10yeah
Candian_Brony that ds is the most important part
00,10and there are diffrent sets
whats the most saught after one?
and how much do they usually cost?
00,10no clue as to what is most soght after but each set had like "rare" versions
Klumzeedragon oh. You can get t-shirts on RedBubble and I got a slick wristband for $12 including shipping, seeing it got here from Kansas
Sumica: I may have to try one. Blind bags are such a gamble though. :D
00,10they cost like buck99
and if the code is stamped properly on the bag sumi sometimes its messed up so you cant tell 100%
DAT PUN
00,10look up a code list
im scared to pull out something pony infront of my brony friends now last time i pulled out the mlp tattoos they went batshit crazy :D
Oh cool. also just read that they are all solid plastic, no stupid hair :P
00,10never seen one with a bad stamp
I just want a Rainbow Dash toy that doesn't look, or is, G3
Heeeey
00,10yeah they are the most like the show.
Canadian_Brony: Yeah. I was just looking at Hot Topic's shirt. Not a very broad selection.
Canadian_Brony: i want gen 4 NEVER TO BE PLANNED AS GEN 4.5
00,10no mind you they can still be a bit messed up
Hey everyone
My favorite so far is Firecracker Burst, as far as Blindbag exclusive ponies
just a machine error Sumica , just something that happens sometimes
Dermathil: Hi! :)
00,10got one that well the eye on it is rather like that one pony from the best night ever
Klumzeedragon do NOT buy from Hot Topic. Shipping is stupid
hi Dermathil
Guess who's turning 18 today
Dermathil: Nice! :)
Dermathil: you
:3
hi Dermathil
ello Dermathil
Canadian_Brony: Oh trust me, I know. I think I've only boughten one thing from their website cause free shipping. :F
:D*
00,10problem realy with most the blind bags is finding any thing past the first set in the US
Dermathil: /)
get some applejack daniels in here for the birthday person
Birthday Brohoof
Klumzeedragon, isnt hot topic the shop that should die?
which reminds me i have a metalic pinkie from wave 5
11,02Happy Birthday Dermathil :)

Spectrum_Rush: thats Shizu's line :D
Klumzeedragon that's stupid. It's probably because I'm up North
11,02Welcome if you are just joining the chat :) Madmax is in some financial difficulty after an earthquake struck her apartment. Luckily, she's alright, but her apartment is another story. She'll be doing a stream which we're featuring on our site right now to help her raise some money to get by this tough time. She's an amazing artist who helped to make the BronyState banner you know
Canadian_Brony, as soon as it crosses the border they charge a ton to ship
Huh...they LOOKED similar...
Sorta.
AJIsAwesome|Tired: it was great :$
SuperBrony64, got a link to her work?
Canadian_Brony: Probably. Would still probably be $10 to $15 to me. And I'm in the US. :P
:)*
And I miss Csimadmax?
Canadian_Brony, arent there some better online places to buy brony merch>?
11,02VenHur: She's on stream drawing still :)
Oh.
Alright, I'm going to bed.
Brad_ anywhere practically. Redbubble is where I bought a good tshirt and I'm planning on buying a second for my lil' sis
/me sings: Crazy Bruce's Liquor
SuperBrony64, shes good. whats the suggested donation?
Awwww. But mayo just messaged me :(
Fuck that, im not going to bed :P
00,10what you feel comfortable giveing
6Mayo messaged you? o.o
Yeah, on skype
hopefully this will be a cover from a fanfic
A Final Fantasy/MLP Fanfic...I don't know how it'll worked...
she should give me drawing lessons.
:P
6Aa,nice x)
Plus, i'm not a fan of fanfics...Hell, I can't even make one up!
Oh crap... paypal funds getting low...
I don't make crossovers, but I want to see a crossover of ponified TouHou and MLP. :D
guess $15 will have to do.
/me transfers from bank
I want a debit card
But...I can tell you guys one the short way...
go to a bank and get one
Soon . . .
SuperBrony64 I will get on that as sooon as I can.

Canadian_Brony, if your under 18 bank account with debit card is free
/me gives VenHur a plate of cookies "best story ever"
11,02Panda: Awesome :)
Brad_ sweet! Bank, here I come!
there should be a fanfic about bronystate
Thanks for the cookies.
Brad_: What's going on?
AJIsAwesome|Tired, what?
Hell, if there's a game based on Equestria Daily, then let's it rain on a Bronystate story!
>.>
00,10huh wah?
Brad_: ABout the whole bank thing. Is this about Paypal?
VenHur: a fanfic about bronystate?
oh god
AJIsAwesome|Tired, oh Canadian_Brony was just wondering about getting a debit card
there already isa game based on Equestria daily
"Heroin Hero"
Oh god, I just gave the internet an idea, didn't I?
Brad_: Oh.........
and i was sending some money for the donation drive.
00,10I think there is a few fan fics
00,10I belive Rawrity made one
Sumica: the moderator fics?
Brad_: So you need a Paypal account to donate?
00,10yeah
AJIsAwesome|Tired, i suppose so
im making a fanfic but it's not about bronystate
Ok.
RAWRity's fics can go jump in a fire.
00,10flutter_spin has one with mods in it
Sumica: I printed those out and read them for a good laugh. Yes I'm crazy.
I'm writing 2 fan-fics and a "Interactive Adventure" story
Meanwhile: that was harsh
my fanfic is a CROSSOVER
00,10Meanwhile is just ban cause he cant realy ship with trixie

good thing I don't write shipping . . . wait . . . romance is an element in one of my stories . . .
That one was by ScootaChicken and it was never finished.
O_O
oh dear
11,02She could have just stopped at the characters and it would have been awesome...but no...she made the entire background worthy of being its own separate artwork...like a boss.
Oh...

F ight club
11,02Moo ^-^
If a hipster is around to say first, will anyone care?
AJIsAwesome|Tired ah. So I was second.
FlGHT CLUB :[
AJIsAwesome|Tired, I got kicked last night for saying the title to The Scottish Movie.
If a tree falls in the forest, and no one is around to hear it, do I care?
You mean Macbeth?
Polydunami: Scottish Movie? :S
Canadian_Brony: i highly doubt it
Scottish play?
Fight Club
yay!
00,10haveing fun?
FIght clob
I find this amusng
*amusing
11,02If a tree falls in the woods and no-one is around to hear it...I'll buy the soundtrack.
The fact that you find it amusing is weird.
Sumica: Isn't hard, when you've got a library card! :P
and I dont' know why
Canadian_Brony, you must be the test kick for saying (REDACTED)
00,10all it realy is. is a modified curseword script
wut SuperBrony64 :D
SuperBrony64: :D haha
I want to join my fight club
Sumica I'll keep a record of how many kicks the bot gets during BMN if you want.
anyone play rayman origins? that be neat to see streamed :D
It still makes a sound, but you won't hear it. :P
Moo
Meomooo
Sumica you have a script for cussing?
-_^
00,10I just have to clear my count to do that too DashWithRainbows
True.
AJIsAwesome|Tired, the sound is from vibrations that go into your ear. Didn't Bill Nye teach you anything?
But surely a 700+ kick count seems something not to waste? :3
So many shirts on Red Bubble... So little cash.
if you modify it does it still kick for curses too?
00,10I do now Canadian_Brony, it's just set to think of Fight club as a curse word
RashWithDainbows.
ah
Polydunami: I never watched Bill Nye. :P
:I
00,10yeah about that DashWithRainbows
Dont say club fight

This reminds me of that racing game for the SNES.
Sumica: it is the jaguar
Super Mario Kart?

No no, Stunt Race FX

I hesitated on saying that
I didnt want to sound too mean
00,10big rigs, that was the one where the bridges were just for show no?

Morgan Freeman isn't dead :/
Dat Eagle
Just searched it. It was a hoax.
...
11,02It's a hoax XD
CGI has come a long way
i would have never stopped reading things in his voice just out of grief
Or god made the hoax because he needed a narator in heaven.
HORSEY
that was my first thought too
damn, they suck at aiming :P
Petrified_Discord: Which is why there is still time for him to voice his own documentary, because once he is gone there is no man who could ever replace his voice
stormtrooper aim?
thisguy: All noobs
Rule #25 of TV media
altair is badass
Their not MLG pro
EVERYBODY sucks at aiming.
StabGun, before GunBlade
May get this game. Probably not.
HoodyNinja: An auto-obituary? Awesome!
flutterchu: Not Altair :/
flutterchu: too bad this isnt him
11,02We just need Morgan Freeman to say every word in the dictionary and then save it for future use.

Twilight Sparkle is in the dictionary
Super Brony 64 hell yez
and every word not in the dictionary

:D damn, i should have come back earlier for that
This video in tf2 style is what led me to finding ponies on the internet and loving them. :$
i found ponies because of guiles theme
ponies work in mysterious ways
indeed
oh dear
I found ponies because my friend bothered me about it for months and I finally gave in a watched it. :P
nice
11,02I can't really play by watching the video as it's lagging on me :/
yeah
Well... I found them cause of the Fortress Heaven video... but the video I found was Apple.MOV. And hence forth I was a brony. Even though I fought it for a month or two. :P
lol
00,02hmmm
00,02anyone for mann up?
Phase4: I got one Mann Up Ticket. :)
Funny. I get no ads at all when I open the stream on my PC
00,02if we get a few more people i'll start a game
Alright. :) Go ahead and add me on steam. My ID here is my Steam name. :D
i saw pics on funny junk but never figured out the name of the show because i thought that my little pony looked different (only knew about g3 and 3.5 at the time) eventually i went on a guile's theme spree saw the sonic rainboom one and i no idea what was going on but it looked cool
i was like hmm maybe i could check out just one episode
famous last words
Phase4, aus or us server?
00,02mann up server
00,02so us server
Wubba dubba dub, is that true?
ugh....300+ ping
Hum... What's with the new TF2 Beta that's popped up?
i saw the shorts for ponies the anthology and proceeded from there then i found out the meaning of brony from a youtube documentory
i eventually got my sister stepbrother and mom to watch the whole thing
Phase4: Steam name? :)
Wubba dubba dub. Is that true?~
meh what happend what they think
I saw a pony vid and wondered wtf it was, and then at the end of it "Produced for Television by Lauren Faust"
at that very moment I decided to watch the entire first season in one night >_>
because I am a huge fan of Faust

00,02AdamTheDuck, the pre-order does
Yay for Guns of Icarus intro music

As long as this game doesn't go on a dlc overdrive, I'll be in a cheery mood for a while :D
Wrek|phone: what was that thing were you battle waves of enenmys
Id join phase4 but school
/me was the one, not WinterSpeed
00,02ah
Well, damn

00,02AdamTheDuck, they'll probably follow in tf2's footsteps and have free with a store
Hello Rain, how's it going? :)
00,02which is probably the best way to do it right now
good
Inb4 Guns of Icarus sells hats.
00,02so no on else here has the beta?
00,02AdamTheDuck, there is already hats
Phase4, if the store is completely cosmetic
Lol :D

I thought that was the origional beta to the game or something >_>
00,02INSTALL
00,02PLAY
00,02IS GOOD GAME
Rain, it's only aroudn 400 mb's if you already have the source engine installed
00,02theres very few people online right now
lol
o.O
00,02probably cant get a good game together
00,02thats the problem with a beta of an online game
Damn, back to TF2 surfing? :P
What a nice frog...
So, what do you do in the game?
00,02RaveBrony, you fly airships
00,02or man the guns on airships
00,02or repair airships
RaveBrony, in a nutshell: a steampunk/dieselpunk airship battle simulator
00,02in the sky
00,02on your airship
00,02did i mention this game has airships
00,02:3

:P
A love Steampunk so much :D Sounds like a good game, lol
00,02i'd give you beta keys if i had any

/me thought you were talking about the tf2 beta >.>
00,02yeah theres like no one online
hello everyone
00,02Rain, guns of icarus > tf2
I'd hand my other copies if my friends weren't so hesitant on whether they want to take the copie because they feel like they're not going to like it and feel guilty for wasteing my money :/
XD
Hey SirGanjalf

Wrek|phone: when you play doom what is the thing called when you vs wave after wave of enemys?
BOW PAUNCH
So what's broken about Skyrim Phase4 ?
I want Skyrim for PC sooo bad.... I have it for the 360 :(
same here
^
No mods... no nothing...
00,02it crashes randomly
No MLP mods? :<
nope
00,02RaveBrony, you silly man
Exactly
for me it's only dat goddamn mouse
The tears of console players, delicious.
like now
I dont play consoles... my parents bought it for me becuz my 2 bros are...
i mean i still like the console version but i want to play some mods
00,02SKOG MC NORD
CrimsonPhoenix, you can buy Skyrim on PC and plug in your xbox/ps3 controller and play as if it was on console but along with all the mods and stuff
00,02LORD OF FIRE
lmao
screenshot it Phase4 :P
AdamTheDuck, but I enjoy Keyboard mouse controls
I just hate the cursor being there
CrimsonPhoenix, Oh I thought you said you hated the mouse :D
Skyrim!
CrimsonPhoenix, wait... Why do you hate the cursor?
What the... is the original cursor not on the Skyrim cursor?
Well, bai guys
Bye WinterSpeed
bye WinterSpeed
But if I get bored again, I'll be back.
00,02AWWW
00,02you cant get his hat
Haha :D
Phase4: stop moon jumping
There's no stopping the bunny hopping :D
00,02SEE WHAT I MEEN
00,02skyrim just goes away
00,02its very anoying
00,02and its only that door
:| That's Bethesda
O_o
it just does that randomly?
00,02no, that door
00,02just that door
00,02its insurmountable
The eeeeeeviiiiiiillllllll door
Troll door
00,02door so hard the game gives up
^
hit it with an axe
the door is telling you you are unready for the outer world
:D
you must be at least level 15 to leave
00,02well thats disapointing
Well, ill be back. Spillling soda all over myself is a good time to shower =_=
00,02the mine spell costs too much mana
isnt it though
Phase4, why you no get illusion spells? :<
00,02what are those
my favorite is calm i stab em then they turn around again
00,02:P
00,02i have not much experience with elder scrolls games
00,02this is my first playthrough of skyrim
oh cool
Phase4, spells like calm makes then neutral towards you and not attack you for a certain amount of tiem
and there's rage which makes them attack everyone around them
well stay crouched a lot your sneak will go up eventually
So as a stealth based magick user, you can get your enemies to kill each other
yeah
00,02ah
that and illusion has invisibility spells
00,02i'll look at those when i have more money
if you max your sneak you can almost be hidden in plain sight all the time
I ran rogue ranger in skyrim
had stealth pretty high up there
I always loved illusion :3
ded :<
AdamTheDuck, so you're like Trixie?
LMFAO
Lesson time
CrimsonPhoenix, :P
right this game is mean with gravity
O_O
oh hai Derpy
DERPY :D
i thought i was seeing things before
lmfaoooo
This is why PC rocks :D
^
OMG:O
i swear to everything if you let her get killed by a bear i will end you
AdamTheDuck: Allow me to quote a YT comment: "Valuable Lesson: Always buy﻿ Bethesda games for PC."
Indeed ^
oh crap now you're around giants
Giants are innofensive
Epic music while riding Derpy :D
lol
just....don't piss them off
00,02how do i get off derpy
There's not escaping her derpiness
You can't
the same button you got on her with
She decide when to let you go
00,02meh, oh yeah
00,02um
00,02thats not working
huh idk then its been awhile
erhmerhurd skyrim!!
00,02i dont see any other button
what are you trying to do?
get off derpy
00,02well
00,02um
00,02i blame magnets
00,02magnetic muffins
How do they work? :|
wait you stole her?!
inb4 he pisses off a giant
Not stole, borrowed without permission meh
ah i see
00,02that is a very observent giant
so it's all justified :P
perfectly
phase you not very good at sneaking
"Standing there like a bloody idiot."
Giants are the best one-way to the moon
WELP
Phase4 is doomed
you missed HAHAHAHA
00,02WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
WELP HES BONED
inb4 SPAAAAAACE
LMFAO
:D
Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
fuck what a hit
TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
BIII-EEETCH
should probably quick save before doing that next time
qs is always a good idea
unless you quicksave in the middle of dying
like my freakin halo game
meh: lol
Well, yeah, but most of games have a double qs slot nowadays anyway
it saved as we were falling off a cliff in the vehicle so we just kept redying

08,01afternoon all
Bye Ponies47
pffft afternoon...
It's so quiet now that flutterchu stopped spamming those image links :<
/me likes peace and quiet
/me 08,01pies AdamTheDuck
08,01MadSurge: good! but we're both kinda sad that i'm leaving today
08,01MadSurge: back home to soctland
08,01my boyfriend lives in tthe netherlands
Awww :) you made it all the way there? so romantic :)
romance is getting excedingly hard to kill these days. i think its for the best though
To kill? o.o
end/sever/etc
its really up to anybodys preferance
I like romance D:
and i said that i think its good that its hard to kill
Unfortunately i prefer old style romance, something women dont fully appreciate anymore =_=
honestly, its like people take things out of context on purpose or something...
RaveBrony, old style?
You know, classic stuff :D Flowers, art, little things.
Wait, people don't do that anymore?
Many woem ni know dont expect such things.
its shame, its like chocolate is a poor choice for close quarters romance or something...
*women
Plus barely anyone acts like a gentleman anymore...
08,01i have my own special brand of romance, generally involving putting the chocolate *onto* my partner...
o.o
Well, makes it taste 10x better im sure :D
I prefer the classic gentlemenly class approach. sadly i havnt met anybody deserving of it
You never cease to get out of my attension spotlight :D
Classy gentlemen, something that has been lacking in today's society. :3
Yep yep
screw swag, class is what people need
I was a complete gentleman in my last relationship... seh didnt care for it =.=
*she
08,01my boyfriend took me to a spa
08,01now thats classy
Luckyyyy
damn straight thats classy
I wanna go to the spa! :[
^
Sponge Bob taught me well... :D
im a guy, but i want to go to the spa, my feet are freackin ugly
08,01AdamTheDuck: well, i did have my pinkie pretty far up him at one pkoint...
lolwut :D
Well, Damn :D
*swedish accent* Very Kinkeh@
00,02um
00,02wow
00,02this game
00,02i honestly dont know which to pick here
08,01hey phase!
00,02and i really do care
Phase4: make him feel dumb
/me blocks his ears "lalalalalalalala"
I should probably stay out of chat as well, ping me when Phase4 is done. 6_9
00,02wrong one
00,02k
O.o
he never asked for it
00,02well
00,02that
00,02: D
00,02this game is AWESOME
lolololololololol
O.o
00,02this bit is not gona be fun is it
i hated this part when i played
cant kill them or something?
you can, but they are really fast
o.o
that was oddly close
well you guys, later, school is moaning my name in a very unerotic fashion
Alright, cya PsychoticDoc!
good luck with that cya round PsychoticDoc
o_o
are you doing non lethal?
ill take that as a no
:o
why cant more games be like this where they outline objects in bright orange
Sometimes they make objects sparkle.
meh: you cant get past that part nonleathaö
But, a lot of people initially complained that the objects were outlined like this.
*l
I managed to complete the game nonlethally. I only killed the bosses, but managed to not kill anyone else.
Nyst: that lot of people obviously never bothered to check the display options that lets you turn off the outlne
Dark_Horst: they added that option precisely for those people who complained. This was back when the game was still in development.
oh, okay then
Ello there everybrony.
hi Malavolent
Hey Malavolent :P
the outlines are damn usefull though. in the original games, back when polygons where expensive and levels had to be designed simple, you'd notice any important object immediately
but finding that one credit chit in todays graphically amazing and completely cluttered with garbage dekss? good luck with that
ikr
and that was one of the worst german accents i've ever heard
peps would be useful here
08,01hullo again
08,01whats on the stream?
THAT was one wasted peps shot
morning, everypony :)
sup
howdy Dark_Horst
These fuvckers in class are discussing how awesome and taented skrillex playback concert was in front of me with the most bimbo of tonrs... WHERE'S MY AXE?
/me pats Wrek on the back
oh good lord
/me hoofs Wrek a battle axe
better give him two
/me peeks to see if Phase4 is done. :3
00,02i'm no
00,02not'
Ahh screw it I'm bored, might as well stay in chat :P
howdy AdamTheDuck
Hello there Sylandest
how are you today, AdamTheDuck? and you, Dark_Horst?
cant complain
YOU DEDDED THEM!
Im suffering...
Just fine Sylandest, although I do want to try out Guns of Icarus but there's not enough people online :/
Wrek: I'm sorry...do you need another axe?
AdamTheDuck: how many people do you need?
Phase4: you can get to the mines without them blowing up while sneaking
Wrek, suffer? This is unheard of
lmaoooo
00,02Dark_Horst, did not know that
Phase4: now you do^^
Whyd they even pick webdesign if its now so geeky and nerdy and above their inteligence
Phase4: cool thing is, you can also diarm them and pluck them off the wall
for later boom-jobs
00,02i REALLY did not know that
00,02and that anoys me
00,02blown so many mines
Phase4: just make sure you're crouched and slow
Hahaha, I hate it when tutorials don't explain every feature :D
GAH
00,02Wrek, o_O
/me licks Wrek as he slowly passes a .22 derringer into his hand :P
seomeone seems to be in need of a torch
08,01kinky!
Ugh, stupid chores. What have i missed? lol
"today we will learn css" "whats that?" "a language" what like swedish?"
Frlgtrtiogeeitcqqtkprvkqy

08,01waiting
00,02Wrek, XD
Wrek, omg hahaha :D
00,02welcome to the world of web design
some people need to burn
/me 08,01licks his lips
I hate people
Jeez
Gona be a baaaaad day now
Wrek, are you ever in a good mood? :D
Atleast i can play marathon in class
Good mood= doesnt ban on sight
08,01in Holland, shagging my boyfriend and drinking fancy beers with him, pretty much
Helllloooooo bronystate!
Hey ofna01! :)
Hello ofna01
morning, ofna01
holland. beer. suuuuuuuuuure
08,01ive seen wrek in a good mood
I'm finally able to get on bronystate for a whole day
08,01Dark_Horst: so. much. beer.
So, have I missed anything?
Battery dying, fuck all!
08,01some ridiculously fancy ones
D:
Bye for now
Nuuu not the batteries
laters, Wrek, take care
Stay strong, Wrek!
Hai
Bye Wrek, have fun at school :P
08,01like there was this smoked one that tasted of ham and bacon
o.o
bacon beer
?
08,01*that* waa delicious
WHAT IS IT CALLED, AND HOW MUCH WAS IT
BACON
08,01aecht schenkerla rauchbier urbock
:O
you island people have weird tastes
08,01had some really nice dark beers
ofna01: he is what happens when you splice a male human with pinkie pie and science
SCIENCE
08,01actually developed a nice appreciation for them
Dat AI
JENSEN SMASH
he dedded them with a peps
that's an art
08,01ofna01: i get that a lot
ded with da peps
08,01im a guy
Ah
Sorry, it was an awkward question
no worries, ofna01
08,01not at all!
pfff, there is no awkward in here
I recently found Fallout 3 at my local Gamestop for 20 bucks, including all the DLC
most uf us thought sumica was a girl for the longest time
his avatar that wrek drew didnt help
ofna01: was on steam once for 7 B)
hahaaha
Dark, my PC is ded
that is a condition you hsould change
i need a whole new PC, it died the day i got MvM for TF2 XD
00,02huh
Phase!
00,02i know you can meet tagert here
00,02really want to
I just built myself a new PC last week
00,02ofna01, ohai
I luckily joined Bronystate when people were on the topic of talking about Sumica being a guy :D
00,02XD
So i knew right off the bat. Funny to see other think hes a girl tho.
Good ol' rule 63
i have the worst autosave ever on Fallout 3
00,02its the name
mine jsut needs upgrades. mainboard, cpu, ram and graphics card
ofna01: I bet there's a few gay people here, no awkwardness :D
that may sound like w hole new pc, but it'll cost only half as much
Makes sense to me.
asus rampage iv extreme, 3930k, 16gigs of ram
you dont need 16
8 are completely sufficient
my Xbox 360 has over 100+ gigs storage available
Then i discovered he was a manly man with pink hair!
thats why I didn't get 16, but I do editing
00,02thats too far back
00,02i meen wouldnt be hard
WE MUST GO BACK FORWARD
TO THE FUTURE
00,02everything betwene me and tagert is either knocked out or dead
00,02but meh
00,02ONWARD
:o
it will go to 64, but I figured 16 would be enough for now
08,01from nokw on, when people ask my gender, ill just say "tree"
:D
08,01gender: curry
just say futa
I apologiza.
08,01ofna01: of course not!
Tree is best gender :D
^
This part was a bit creepy to me.
skullfuck
08,01futa is best gender
o_o
o.o
bomb has been planteed
eeyup
I wished I never asked my friend what a futa was.
LOL
Hahaha
we need to show the Counter Strike: Global Offensive trailer...
That trailer was awesomesauce
EHHH RUSSIAN VODKA
O.o
Oh god :D
...then again, that would probably throw natuaral population controll out the window
Meh, gross but very true, haha
futa is both genders isnt it?
yes
ofna01, pretty much
08,01futa is best of both worlds
I obtain breakfast, come back, and find this topic...how silly of you lot
Females with dicks, right?
08,01two sets of fun parts to play with
/me grabs his stomach and covers his mouth
:D
^
00,02what am i suposed to do?
...i dont see the problem...
00,02theres a thing
00,02the glass thing
00,02should have picked up a laser rifle
08,01eachmeh, each to their own
00,02dat malformed text
00,02or not malformed
00,02windows has screwy fonts
Phase4: i think it has something to do with shooting the three wiredin women
been a while sicne i did that
08,01Koen says that those of you saying "eew" are probably secretly into it anyway :P
LOL
._.
Haha I remember those statistics
quite probably
00,02Dark92Enigma, already did that though
I lol-ed
00,02i meen Dark_Horst
00,02tab fail
it would probably throw me off a bit, to see a mans face with womans breasts....
Phase4: somehow you have to open a window in the bosses defenses
JENSEN SMASH
wrong button
Pffft, I like my women with their normal genitailia :D
same
thatw as easy
08,01ofna01: cant beat chicks with dicks.
:D
XD
ofna01: Good man :D
BUTTONS!
A, B, or C?
poosh booton
there's also a D button
And apparently I killed the chat
Yes you did MadSurge
meh
Basically, you either expose one of the bad groups, or kill yourself.
boom button
i pressed that
DA BOOM BUTTON
not as spectacular as you might think
Phase DO THE BOOM BUTTON
right button is desabled becasue you didnt speak to taggart
00,02the darrow button seems closest to the truth
00,02and thats what i'd like to say
00,02Dark_Horst, i know, it disapoints me :(
00,02middle button
Phase, do you have minecraft?
00,02because its in the middle
00,02ofna01, yeah
you got Tekkit?
00,02this ending feels bad
00,02ofna01, i've got the launcher
yeah, but seeing how this game plays before then first deus ex, it didnt happen anyway
Phase, you should stream some tekkit with meh
00,02middle button cause i havent seen it
this ending is bad and you should feel bad!
at least that'S what i conclude7
this ending makes me sad.
:(
tis very solemn
pretty much the point of the gane
:'(
*game
it is done
wat a story mark
i like how this game points out a quite possible future for mankind
did i miss the other ending?
So, my birthday is coming up soon
in 21 days
Nice :o
Phase4: did you already do the other ending?
22 maybe, may have miscounted
I like this ending music....
/me hums along
this is music to move in slow motion to
so did he do the other ending or not?
not sure, twilight_sprinkle

Phase, we need someone to streaaaaam
Phase4 though i'm still more and forever will be for DX1 cause it's just......GOOD
00,02there are a LOT of options
Ready to attack the day, or have you already surrendered?

00,02killerpony7733, ikr
INTRUDER ALERT!
00,02if only it worked on my pc
Phase4: i liked the splinter-cell kind of sneak game :P
RED SPY IS IN THE BASE!
Phase4 oh you having problems? tell me
I wish I could stream stuff to you all during these downtimes, but I'm not sure if you'd all like old anime and sci-fi movies.
irrelevant though, my pc coldnt handle this game anyway
Phase4 i may be able to help ye
this game looks intresting
00,02twilight_sprinkle, its worth playing
00,02ah
00,02killerpony7733, galaxy.dll i think
Phase4: my skyrim lags on 800x600 with optimization modes :<
00,02the audio driver dies in a callback from windows
*mods
00,02twilight_sprinkle, it should handle this *just*
i will buy this eventually but for Xbox
Phase4 is yours steam or non steam?
dont wanna risk spending the money if ends up not being able to handle it
00,02i will critisize the game for being a bit too orange
:$
00,02killerpony7733, steam
Phase4 hmm tried doing the verify cache thing as a standard fix?
inb4 smooze? :3
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geNMz0J9TEQ&feature=relmfu
00,02killerpony7733, eyup
Phase4 hmm...how much have you tried to fix it with so far?
00,02just about everything
00,02changed all the audio config options
00,02even messed with the video options
Interesting
00,02it only works when you disable sound
Grass grows, birds fly, sun shines, and brudda, i hurt people.
Wish some mod streamed Chtulhu Saves The World :D

Phase4 While i do not know if it could work but installing a complete type mod that enables other drivers and fixes a good deal of things. Think it COULD work?
needs moar BSOD
00,02killerpony7733, i've not found one for sound

:D
well thats enough for my hourly dose if insanity fueled by lack of sleep. now to linux stuffs
twilight_sprinkle you use linux?
Lil_B: no but i have programming homework in linux
twilight_sprinkle I wish I could programm -.- even some basic coding , but there is no way to learn that around here except online courses
Lil_B: learning programming by yourself is pretty easy
twilight_sprinkle do you know a good tutorial for a basic programming language ?
Lil_B: sorry no
twilight_sprinkle than how can I learn it by myself?
Lil_B: i learned all ym stuff in school. but its really not that hard, the basics at least like looping and if statements
Lil_B: just find a tutorial online
Lil_B: idk any tutrials myself to sugget
*suggest
twilight_sprinkle ok :/
POOTIS
twilight_sprinkle maybe I stumle upon a good one some day, the ones I've seen so far where rather... pointless and not well explained, and yeah, there is no school around here offering something like this :(
http://imgur.com/CmqnX
and why the hell is gangnam style in the comments ??????
Dear Lord this OST is Amazing
Lil_B: i can try to explain the stuff i know, but ive only begun c++ and i cant explain in-depth
twilight_sprinkle no need for that, I think programming is too big of a field for a beginner to explain it over a chat in his spare time XD

05ok starting up

Gold_Demona: then we think the same :) she's among my 3 favs!
05now
05what to play..
Abuse? :D
05too few peopel onlien to see me suffer
MadSurge: Among the mane 6, AJ is number 4 on my list.
AJ does NOT get enough love D: There was even something on EqD aout it :D
How could anypony decide on a favorite?
Gold_Demona: 3rd
My favs are Rarity, (Pinkie or Twi), AJ, FS, and then RD
my ranks of favor, rather ^
AJ would be like the best mom though, dont you think?
Wrek wanna go for tribes ascend?
I can play with ya
Gold_Demona: 4th is Rarity :D gotta love her hamminess
Muahaha! Just got my Scotsman Stove Pipe! :D
for 1.33, sucker.
MadSurge: My mane 6 order is as follows: Top fave is Pinkie. Rarity and Fluttershy fight over second and third. Then AJ. Then Rainbow. Then Twilight.
RaveBrony (\ Rarity is best
Lil_B: /) ;)
Rarity and Fluttershy used to fight over first and second, but Pinkie bounced her way up the list and now she's my top mane 6. :P
for me its 1.twi 2.rarity 3. trixie. 3.9 luna 4. everyone else 5. fluttershy
05the musi cis while i take my pick
Gold_Demona: Pinkie/Fluttershy, AJ, Rarity, Twalaht and RD :D
I don't understand why The Great and Powerful Trixie has so many fans... I think she's awful...
^
Wrek alrighty~ i'm keeping the offer to play with ya in tribes if you so desire :P
MadSurge: Good reason to like a character.
My list: 1 Rarity, 2 Twilight, than a huge drop down, 3 RD, 4 Pinkie, 5 Fluttershy 6 Applejack
05#1 Twilie #2: rest of mane 6 and prinesses etc
Lil_B - that is VERY surprising to hear. thats an original order
Hehe
Wrek: we know you like Twilie :)
Thats news to me
Far Princess is Luna. tabitha all the way! :D
*Fav
Wait, dafuq? Since when does Wrek like Twi? :o
I never knew >_>
:D
05RaveBrony: enough so that she's in most of my dreams
05and not in a dirty way even! :D
Wrek: :D
Oh geez :D
My Mane 6 order goes as this: Top favorite is :), then goes :O, then :D, and then >_>.......favorite Princess is LUNA.
wish i dreamt of twi, or any pony for that matter, even fluttershy. instead i dream of weird stuff and/or zombies and ghosts :I
DERPED
HOLD ON
I dont dream of ponies :(
Here i go again
I never dream of ponies, only weeeiiiird stuff or B-movie scenarios
I had a lucid dream last week. Best dream EVER! :[
Ha twilight_sprinkle, we dream alike :D
05haha
MadSurge: sucks huh :(
05FMLE crashed from the awesomeness
twilight_sprinkle: apart from no ponies... not so much :P
Well, i think it was a lucid dream... I wasnt able to make pionies appear O_o
*ponies
05i have lucid dreams all the time :3
Wrek we dream alike
LAWL
Im getting them more often. Ever since i started pinching myself in real life :D
I dream either rarely or it's too random and out there i can't remember them
It's easier to find least favourites than normal favorites
I think in terms of other Ponys... I think I kinda care for Luna and I really dig the Fez Pony XD
Wrek YES YES YES I LOVE YOU
oh nice
DocSane: It started off as an 'end of the world' dream. But when i got impailed in the foot and felt no pain i realized it was a dream and started blowing up shit! :D
You should try the Nameless Mod Wrek. Its a tc for this game.
i only had lucid dreams as a kid when i had the same nightmare every night for 3 years
o_o
Barbetos|AtWork Heard of it never used it. But i honestly prefer the game Vanilla at any given time~
05the weirdest thign is when you as a kid have a dream
05then a few years laters in your teens you remember said dream
Top favorite is :), then goes :O and then :( and then :D then goes ;) then ;)........favorite background pony is :P (no question) and Favorite Princess is LUNA
05and then after a while re-dream it exactly
RaveBrony: My lucid dream was very mundane, but odd. I found myself in what looked like a restaurant or a saloon.
I FORGOT AJ AGAIN......derped
What did you do? :D
RaveBrony: I noticed a guy behind the bar eating a ham sandwich. He looked Muslim, which I thought was odd because he was eating pork.
Wrek: I've had that happen to me. It's freaky. o_o
DocSane: Lol :D
RaveBrony: I asked him "Am I dreaming?" to which he replied "Yes, as am I."
Good afternoon bronystate :)
o.o
Hey MLP_Brovakiin
RaveBrony: I swear to God, this actually happened.
Hiyo MLP_Brovakiin
Wrek God i can't tell how happy i am for you streaming this
Wrek: its even weirder when something happens to you irl that you dreamt of, and you dont remember about the dream until it happens. that happened to me a Lot
I speeel my DRINK!
Well, I slept in and missed school
RaveBrony: At that moment, I realized I was dreaming and the fuzziness of thought you get when you dream just vanished.
Hows everyone doing today?
Wrek Oh your having this problem
RaveBrony: I knew I was dreaming, but the reality of the dream seemed as real as waking life.
Wrek You NEED to get a driver mod and all to make this go away and run normally
DocSane: Haha :D
Wrek I can link you the solution
05DO SUC HRGITH AWU
Top favorite = :) 2nd = :O then goes = :( and then = :D then = ;) and then goes = >_>.....favorite background pony is :P hooves down, and favorite Princess is Luna
Got love lucid dreams... but of course there are some tests you have to do before you start going all crazy :D
Wrek It's techinally a more complete thing it adds alot extra stuff to use as options but yeah brb then
FINALLY GOT ALL THE MANE 6
RaveBrony: I tried walkign around in the fake environment and managed to walk around the room a bit before I felt it all start slipping away as I began to wake up.
TWILY <3
RaveBrony: So, as I said, my lucid dream was very mundane and short-lived, but it was a true lucid dream.
Its quiet during the day
DocSane: Still nice tho :D look up stuff to have them more!
05killerpony7733: whats takign so long? :P
I pinch myself, haha
The doctor is in!
RaveBrony: I've tried, but I rarely remember my dreams.
D:
DocSane: I sleep VERY deeply (Since I started using a CPAP a few years ago).
I had a dream of scootaloo failing her exam and she became a knight of a chess game.
I was like, wat
It was an awesome dream.
I dreamt I was on fire
._.
That's cause you're so hot~
/me takes his shirt off
Oh god :D
.. that chest hair
KnifeH: ;)
gdi Im tired
I blame bronystate
I think I'll cancel my cable and just watch this site from now on.
HoodyNinja: best reason to be tired though :F
DocSane lol
*:D
MadSurge: True
DocSane: Get sattelite, its great!
The best part is is that you cant tell if im being sarcastic or not
Except when it rains and really cloudy!
HoodyNinja: Not for love or money. I live on the beach. The weather plays hell with sat TV around here.
HoodyNinja: Plus I get an excellent net connection from Comcast.
Techinical difficulties?
DocSane: Comcast customer support is shit
HoodyNinja: Good thing I very, very rarely use it.
Comcast in general is shit
HoodyNinja: It's Comcast or DSL here.
but whatever, i dont supposed direct tv is any better
In other words, a 30/2 connection or a 3/768k connection.
like i care, i hardly even use tv
:O Old timey Deus Ex?
DocSane - what company is the DSL from?
MadSurge yeppers
I hardly watch TV, but I split the bill with my upstairs neighbor.
and now for something completly different
MirrorImage: Verizon.
i think i'd try my luck more with the DSL than comcast
A Larch
killerpony7733: EYE SPEEL MAH DREENK
MirrorImage: I really have no complaints with Comcast. I used to have RCN, but they don't serve this town.
for long gaming sessions, though, comcast is rather inconsistent
i swear it would kick me off at least once every 30-60 minutes
Hello everypony :3
Hiyo Dragonmatte
which isn't a good thing when you're hosting a server
Hello Dragonmatte
Is it crashing wrek?
Barbetos|AtWork Hes tweaking it a bit i believe cause it's a tiny bit tricky to get the complete thing i sen't him to work at first
Oh is it that custom exe?
hi Dragonmatte
Barbetos|AtWork yes along with enchanced drivers adding more graphical power to it and all
can I lend someones times for a min? I need an opinion on something
Cool. I was about to start linking the same stuff. =P
Bless you Wrek. =P
Barbetos|AtWork oh and several objects may have been changed if wrek decided to get them downloaded he will also have interactable objects with HD models instead of the old
Lil_B: what do you want someones opinion on?
i go to go everypony i have to go to nightschool
Howdy y'all!
Goodbye Maid_RainBow
Dragonmatte I'm making a Desktop Pony for someone, I'm still new to designing somthing like this. In the Animation he's sitting in a chair and I wanted to ask someone if the way he sits in the chair looks odd
Do swimming! It does not help at all!
=D
bye maid... gone :(

Lil_B: Link?

Dragonmatte thanks, just a sec :)

That face will haunt my nightmares
Wrek god no one can ever forget all the quotes from this game~
yeah, smash some crates Freeman style
GO ALL FREEMAN ON THEM BAWXES!
They are imprinted to your brain
Iron and copper
A BOMB!
What was the phrase again? I forgot.
Copper and silver?
Is he, like, invisible?
The crowbar, I almost thought he was playing HL.
How did he not see that?
shh! They will hear you idiot!
Barbetos|AtWork Gold and iron >_>
Nooo. It was philosophers stone.
thats right.
HoodyNinja - Level 1. The big bad always sends the most incompetent mooks for Level 1
NO! it was La li lu le lo!
MirrorImage: Fuck that
Oh no wrek alerted enemies~

RaveBrony Deus ex 1
Oh, haha

Tis is the code that is Deus ex
Suddenly star wars droid sounds
Chat derp?~
Nope

Dragonmatte: It used to be, then the penguins attacked

Oh, is Wrek playing Deus Ex?
Kammerjunk: Yep :).
No wrek, it's bumtease!
oh my
bzzzzt
It gets funnier every time
*Bzzzt!* Oooh the pleasure!

HoodyNinja: It really does.
*Ded
oh hey, good ol deus ex

Yeah! Lets beat some minorities!
BIRD! BIRD! BIRD! KILL IT! It's eeeeeevil....
Pirate's aren't terrible people, birds are terrible people!
Dragonmatte: Horses are murderers
first mission?
Ye, i think
I've never actually played this, I really should :S
Dragonmatte Do it man
Just do it!
I love those games, the ones you play a billions times yet don't get boring.
If it get's on sale on steam ^^
or you could get it from thepiratebay
That lady
Her face is scary.
600mb or something
Everlasting_Joy: Agreed
Dark_Horst: BAAAAD! xD
What wrek said
It's worth what it costs
so where can i egt it
^
Dark_Horst steam you numbty
Or GOG.com
Dark_Horst: try Steam or gog
Either works
Wrek: What of the sequel? Should we get it as well?
/me has no money.
I usually dont download, only fallout 3, which wouldn't come to our store, still waiting for it, and McPixel :3
what is that in the lower right?
So no game for me :(
/me is on the same boat as RaveBrony
*left
/me has no money as well.
As soon as fallout 3 comes in mah store, i shall buy it :3
Dark_Horst universal key. You pick up keys they get stored and you can use the unlocker anytime if you got a matching key for a said door
Wrek you don't kill in these sort of games, right? :I
Dark_Horst oh umm i can't see now so i can't tell ya
2,14 Wrek wut u doin! Quit playing the nonlethal route!
"I didn't see a unicorn."

Hey Everlasting_Joy
*back
Hiyo SafariMonkey
Hey MLP_Brovakiin
hey Gold_Demona
Wack.
Zap n' hit - my favourite DE tactic
i am sad
In Deus Ex there's always not enough ammo
^
dat GRAAAGH
Rainbodah: :(, I hate that.
Ammo is to be hugged and used smartly
~
pew
Of course
Dat Statue of Liberty forehead
But in a middle of the game
Or in a 1/3
i like how a crossbow makes a silenced pistol sound
XD
There will be a Nanosword
Rainbodah Oh yeah that with fully maxed melee and all?
The thing DESTROYS
Yes
It can kill people with 1-2 hits
Even robots
Wrek: you're playing the game of the year edition from steam?
Rainbodah i believe the mech commandos with fully upgraded melee skill kills them in 1 hit
Dark_Horst: He is.
Who's streaming?
SafariMonkey: wrek.
if only my CS 1.6 worked.....
I think so
then i know what to look for
Everlasting_Joy: thanks
He sounded like he enjoyed it:D
I remember that this sword kills everyone in 1-2 hits
With maxed melee
my -censored- is augmente

ooh
SirGanjalf So much he fell unconcious to the smacks~

The fun has been augmented

Fail
"Now this is what I signed on for!" You shot one guy! That's hardly much action.
playing on hard?
God damnit, every time i launch CS 1.6 my menu is invisible.....
ofna01: Why did you cencor it then, it is just a nose :D
That's what you get for smacking someone's balls with a batton
bzzzzzt
stupid resoloutin glitch
take 2, with FEELING this time
that's on above hard i presume?
Dark_Horst yes generally a headshot kills you INSTANTLY without shields
I don't remember: Do JC have any active augments at first mission?
SirGanjalf no only his light thingy
oh
He gets his first one rather quickly after this if you grab the aug canister
I love how blind the guards are.
fail
Hehe nice wrek
use a gas nade? Or does that kill?
augmentation in this game is pretty advanced
Barbetos|AtWork only keeps them stunned sorta for a bit
none of those clunky robot arms, it'S al nano biotech
pWelo

Derp
The other guy went to. . Never mind.

Just how fucking dumb are these guards?
Crotch shot!

Mmm water
1 hp
that'll take a while
Water is good for you. :D
So... thirsty...
eeyup
No more water for ANYONE
They have the Atlantic Ocean, I doubt they'll run out ;).
But you can't drink water from the ocean. D:
Everlasting_Joy: I doubt they can safely drink the sea water either.
SirGanjalf what if they got augs for that?
wrek is the speedbug solved in ths version?
Dark_Horst yeah it fixed it.
SirGanjalf: There's a reason I put this at the end ;).
I knew the site i had in my head was the one that fixes it
"Who farted!"
^#
ded
"Oh my god, that STENCH!"
It sounds like their acting or something.
wut
WUT
"Smeeell baaaaaad!!!" D:
I like how it just stuns them, but it kills you.
His farts are augmented.
Barbetos|AtWork game logic man~
i wonder. can they see the light of your vision augment?
Yeah I know lol
bam
Old game logic was funny like that
Welp
Dark_Horst i think so
Just like the water fountain running out of water
Gas grenades are just for running through areas aparently.
God that guy has a horrible looking face
did wrek not pick up the environmental suit?
OMG JC A BOMb
SpadeMagnes[School]: Gotta love these old 3D models.
Why did you do that
becasue reasons
and hpw the fuck did that guard not see him
WREK HAZ GONE NUTS! SHOOT ON SIGHT!
For shits and giggles?
was that a shotgun on the lower left?
Renegade points
it looked like one
Everlasting_Joy: You think these models look bad? Try first "Thief"
oh, smg
SirGanjalf: Have any pics?
TNT box is best companion cube

ALL THE MEDBOTS!
Good fucking lord those models look like shit
Dark_Horst: They look like LoZ: OoT if it was at a slightly poorer quality. Then again, this is when 3D games were just being created.
Hi everypony.
Howdy VenHur!
Hello VenHur
They dont look too bad, since it was one of the first 3d modeled games and stoof

"Have a trophy. You're a winner."
Everlasting_Joy: Personally i think the low number of polygons made them creepier.
I'm throwing your trophies at you! Here!
not in MY protocol
Redecorating, Wrek?
SirGanjalf ever seen some of the older blizzard 3d animations?
God they were creepy
He is taking the abuse rather well.
SirGanjalf: I agree, but again, this is the dawn of 3D gaming.
PLANTS
Wrel: Interior Decorator Extraordinaire
Wrek*
his stepdancing is augmented
HOW IS HE NOT SEEING THIS
HOW
he is
killerpony7733: Yep, i remember WCII intro, for example
I meant the guard
he did comment on it
Mmm water
I can see your sprites game
SpadeMagnes[School]: Eever been in a game so hard, you don't notice the world?
That noise is so silly.
Its just a circle!
Amurica!
UNATCO
go go gadget sound track!
MURICA
Very pretentious. I love it.
This theme is just.......ORGASMIC
United Nations Anti Terrorist Co Operation?
lol
i think it's just CO
for corporation
First day on the job and stealing stuff from other offices.
Also a good thing to note the game changes in music themes hinting to the current situation of what's going on
Unatco is not a corp.
redecorate ALL the offices
Barbetos|AtWork: Sounds like a job at a grocery store.
Why is Wrek constantly taking plants with him?
Who am I? I'm Plantman
^
SirGanjalf: coalition then
SpadeMagnes[School]: Why arn't you?
SpadeMagnes[School]: He needs a constant supply of oxygen.
Dark_Horst: Maybe.
Plantman! *hums megaman bos select theme*
Ohrange
CONSPIRANCES
*boss
The plot.
He wanted orange!. But got lemon lime :<
Conspiraces*
everybody is plotting against poor gunther
When live gaves you orange, don't make Orange Juice!
^:D
goddamn lowtechs hating on the poor hightech
I wonder if Wrek likes the music. :P
WREK SPOKE!?
Yeah :O
Wow, it's like Shizuschlafen actually talking!
he kinda does that
Make life take the lemons back! GET MAD!
Stop playing with the water cooler
And JC never uses the bath room
NotVordox no surprise he has been doing that for a few days now
*oranges, fuck
Its not a toy
He must have an augmented bladder to.
i blew it:(
NotVordox: He has been speaking all stream
Barbetos|AtWork: His sweat is augmented.
Thought that was in game dialogue
Lolwut
oh fair enough
SirGanjalf comes straight from the augmented bladder I bet.
Marking where he wizzed?
Seriously Wrek, you have a BIG case of OCD?
steal ALL the soda
Not sure if OCD or bad Feng Shui...
I like how Adam has regenerative capabilities, and JC doesn't. I know the point of it, but it really messes with the cannon.
SirGanjalf: Epic Interior Decorating
Barbetos|AtWork: Government
Your NotVordox
WHO ARE YOU?
I am...
NOT
You're even.
Vampire
Secret trap door~
Spy 'round here....
Just because I have to find you doesn't mean I WANT to.
dem keyboard pants
Is it against the rules to be a imposter as a imposter when a poster is the real poster or is that allowed? <.<
6_9
it seems quite dark in this game
He will watch your back ALL the time
JC Denton and the quest to find a bathroom.
Does Wrek just like plants?
This is what he really trying to do.
:D
Lol
I'm not sure why, but this game makes me really want to play Soldier of Fortune :P
SHOVE EVERY THING IN THERE
YOU BROKES IT
Strong woman
Moar plantz!
She broke it! She has augments too.
MLP_Brovakiin: Similar old yet nostalgic graphics?
Unatco just gives them away like candy
ALL THE PLANTS
Good thing JC can't throw fridges yet...
SirGanjalf: Yep, ya hit the nail on the head right there :D
SirGanjalf: he can't flip tables either.
One day...
"I am not going to hold your hand." You hand her the trash. . .

I would want Wrek to design my new house
:P
Guard is like: You're that new interior decorator? M'kay...
HAH
That plant
Damnit, my version of windows isn't compatible with solder of fortune :(
the plant is now fully briefed for the mision
God their faces bother me

Moopy: It is clearly Call of Battlefield: Oblivion
okay, for reals? deus ex
i don't think thats call of duty dude
Moopy: Kinda close. People who wanted to be like Neo were playing this before Max Payne came out.
Moopy: Ok like Dark_Horst it is acctually the first Deus Ex

MLP_Brovakiin: He already threw one into the ocean before.
jc bludgeoned him to death already
and threw the body off the pier
lol
just like this
LMAO!
the only good kid is a dead kid!
That's awesome! XD
haha :D
JC Denton does not understand the meaning of a practical joke.
Now I have My Country Tis Of Thee stuck in my head. Thanks, singing hobo. :P
Singing hobo is best hobo
this game kind of reminds me of James Bond from N64
Goldeneye yeah
And Half Life
The first one
Just as blocky too
You made his foot fall asleep.
lol
JC is a clutz

JC Dentroll

killerpony7733, truth
Wrek is very talented. He can throw a trashcan without knocking it over or even making the lid come off. :P
And it lands standing up. :D
I recently downloaded Goldeneye to N64, and found out why it's so extremely blocky. It was a whopping 4mb
so why does most everypony don't feel like themselfs here?
Whatnow?
dat broken robot
To think those robots actually exist now
sortof-
And they are smaller!
hehe yeaa
What do you mean Moopy?
and one of them crashed and ran away, and they had to chase it to turn it off
like how come you guys don't feel like yourselfs?
I feel like myself-
I don't get what you mean by that
i know that but but most anypony
Who said they didn't feel like themselves?
i did
>__>
i was asking though
Um... Then it's because you're imagining it?
Is this related to a conversation further up?
Cuz I have no idea what you're talking about. O_o
^
me neither <,<
hmmm that explains everything
/me is still confused
/me walks away slowly
Smart wrek is smart
wow
This game is so early 2000's cybery
you know, when PVC was cool and girls had pink dreads
Yep
Well, he can't get no satisfaction.
E
And eating cheeseburgers
house of 1000 corpses
So much BLOOD!
O wrek
Are you painting the floor with the corpse?
Wrek is making art! :D

Gold_Demona: He makes art 'til someone dies. Like Joker!
Moar water!

Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Doctor Whooves and Assistant Collab with Doctor Whooves Adventure
We're too busy watching the stream I guess
tries to revive chat
JC has clearly lost it.
Pretty much
Yush this part <3
whats going on
^I have no idea!
You are seeing the godly mod known as the malkavian mod for DX1
Randomness incarnate
:3
:D
HIIIII
Easy to bribe?
Kammerjunk pretty much~
I remember playing this :0
Same
I don't even know what I'm listening to anymore.
Kammerjunk it's full of wut and wat
Hehe
It is.
I don't understand too, JC.
er whats going on
Don't know how this relates to FIM :c
LyraTheGreat we aren't exactly ponies 24/7 ya know
LyraTheGreat: You don't want to ask for ponie.
ponies*
Not meaning to ask
This reminds me of that one game on the Gamecube...
O.o
What's it called again...?
LyraTheGreat: Usually the pony stuff is shown on Movie night and when the new episodes air on Hub
VenHur Not sure what you mean but this game is Deus ex 1
O.o
I had a gamecube once, I gave it to my friend
heh
And I don't have the Hub.
XD Moskau!
Moskau!
LyraTheHub: Neither do most of us here. :P
LyraTheGreat*
Oh! Immigrant song!
lol that bad typo
Moskau! Moskau! Deine Seele ist so groß! Nacht da ist der Teufel los!
Ha ha ha ha ha! Hey!
Nachts* goddammit
i wonder what the admin is doing right now?
Oh yeah, now I remember, this game is kind of like Ikaruga!
Youtube is my resource for Ponies, the Hub isn't in the UK
He's watching the video? along with any other mods maybe peeking in
It isn't that hard to figure out Moopy
Aww did i missed the Moskau part?
SirGanjalf yeppers :<
The Hub is not in Denmark either so the livestream is my source
LyraTheGreat: Which is why we come here. Mods stream Hub so we can all watch new episodes when they air.
He could be watching me in the chat right now to make sure i don't say anything rude or something bad i guess
Applejack2012 Yep pretty much
Did he just mindfeck a robot...?
I'm new to this, so thanks for telling me that :L
its funnier to watch ponies on chat
Ikaruga is a Gamecube game similar to this.
LyraTheGreat how new?
LyraTheGreat: And now you know, and knowing is half the battle! :D
mod asleep post ponies
the hub isn't in europe
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
I became pegasister 3 months ago, I found this site today :L
Welcome, LyraTheGreat =3
HIYA everypony
I became a Brony for a year ago
Well, welcome to the heard, LyraTheGreat. =)
herd*
welcome
I became a brony 25 years ago
:P
Applejack2012: Yeah. I'd say the lack of the Hub here sucks, but I already have all the episodes in 720/1080p.
Season 3 is in October, I think. I might be wrong
You people don't know how easy you have it. Being a brony back in my day in 1759 was tough, I tells you!
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Crystal Empire DVD Information Released!
LyraTheGreat I would say pegasister is a silly term to use cause brony works just as much females as it does with males
Me too NotVordox for 25 years ago
There's been no official announcement on the season opener. =(
Not bad AppleDash :D
LyraTheGreat Oh and since you are new to this site. Have ye read the rules and FAQ?
Ha. No one reads the bloody rules anymore.
Yup
I stand corrected.
Half of it
:L
mr know it all lol
LyraTheGreat nice. Welp all there is to follow the rules and you'll enjoy being here :P
Okay!
THIS DIALOGUE IS SO BAD
I know right :O
EarthBound...damn fine good game.
Yup
I'll get an SNES soon, then I can get EarthBound :3
VenHur: spoil and you will know a death very painful
LyraTheGreat: one does not simply come across a copy of earthbound
very rare game
Rly?
hence why i got an emulator
I ain't spoiling, chill...
I will take a vial of pony.
I have an NES emulator, My SNES emulators don't work :0
ha
i mean, im sorry
thats how i play chrono trigger, my fav game of all time
x3
So any one heard about the Mother 4 fangame?
chrono trigger is also tied with final fantasy 6 and 7 for my fav game of all time actually
i will have to get into earthbound later actually, have final fantasy 8 to burn through
BABIES...Oh the humanity...
Bronysith did you play Mother 2 or 3?
Lil_B: mother 2 IS earthbound...
ill be back later guys, have to restart my copmuter actually
Alright, see ya Bronysith.

Am I the only one who has a REALLY hard time reading Caramel's text? It might just be my client, but I want to make sure.
is just flashy
no seriously, i thought it was a movie, i have seen final fantasy seven advent childeren or something like that
Caramel: I don't mind, peoples has opinions, so i'm not going to go all "HOW DARE YOU DEFY THIS GREAT GAME!" on you.
The joys of SSH
Just putting this out there (I never played any FF games), but why is this game so bad?
in 8, you go into spaaaaccceee
AJIsAwesome: play final fantasy 6 or 7 then 13 and you will see
RoboGerbil: same in 7
RoboGerbil: NO SPOILERS
Well that didn't work. :P
Bronysith: I'll try to.
how is that a spoiler?
DAT VOICE ACTING
I never really cared for the wholeFinal fantasy either :/
lyro is now an character
Ness: Stop buzzing around my head!!
lyra*
Anyone here familiar with basic Mac OSX/Bash scripting?
lyra has my attentiion not the stream
Ness: I mean, geesh, annoy Porky!
so final fantasy is doing real time battles now
Rinoa is my favorite FF female
AJIsAwesome (What I've heard) Really unlikable Characters (Emo's, Douches or Idiots or plain Annoying)
AJIsAwesome: Compared to the older FF games, this game is really bad. The only thing this game has going for it is that the graphics are really pretty. =/
DAMM ADD
Gold_Demona: THIS IS A GAME?!
VenHur are you playing earthbound right niow?
Okay. Thanks, guys.
Lil_B: No actually...
If you are, talk to ofna01, he needs your help

LIGHTNING IS KRISTEN STEWART

she has no emotion whatsoever
does anyone know when MLP FIM season 3 starts
Thunder-Crescent: nope

This year... as far as I know
its all secrets and lies
but at least you get some input in this... xenosaga you watch 45 min of movie before you can do anything
but not even that I can confirm, sorry :/
oh well worth a shot
That's weird, what's with the gameplay mechanics?
The general problem with Final Fantasy XIII in a nutshell. When fans have to defend the game by saying "It gets better after the first 24 hours of play time"
final fantasy
how many cut scenes does this have
?
alezzm: whats a chocobo?
Is this some new kind of battle system?
alexxm*
I miss the turn-based menu-select battle system. What was so wrong with that system?
Ember: flightless bird used for riding
AJIsAwesome: Yep, its more of an extention of the Final Fantasy XII auto-battle system
Ember that little chicken thing that was on the screen
ff7:cc was hella fun from the first minute and kept getting better :P
Unnr: Okay.
that'S a TINY chocobo
the only SOLIDER is shinra
BABY chocobo
Ish a chicobo in fact
Chocobo must go through one HELL of a growth spurt
i say cloud, because thats the only name i know xD
twilight_sprinkle: yeh but what brough ff7 down was the part where you had to dress in drag just to advance...
Nooo, Buzz Buzz, you only lived for 9 mintues!
Ember you see that bird that guy was holding thats a chocobi
I saw JonTron do a video on this game, but it really wasn't in-depth.
00,10every ff has had active time battle
why does this game even need a camera? the only direction is FORWARD
00,10it's was at one point an option
hello there sumica sup dude
BEST FF character is TERRA
RoboGerbil: I thought that part was funny. Expecially if you go to the trouble to make it so Don Cornero picks Cloud. :P
00,10Sup
RoboGerbil: idk i never actually played ff7, only ff7:c
&cc
Hey everyone ^^
hows it going?
*cc
AJIsAwesome As far as I know, you give everyone a role (like wizard, warrior or similar) before the fights and in battle, they pertty much just fight on their own while you press the attack button :/ I really would reccomend watching Spoonys Videos about it for In-Deph hilarious ranting on the game XD
hoi Litwick
It's difficult for people to say why they don't like FFXIII. I have yet to hear a good, simple explanation :P
I don't remember the first Final Fantasy having it.
zack fair ftw
no seriously, the only anmes i know are from a movie...
names*
Lil_B: Okay.
Thunder-Crescent: ikr
Petrified_Discord: how about shit gameplay and it is just a movie
Thunder-Crescent: best character
Petrified_Discord: horrible story
i thought you were still asleep though sumica
Final hallway 13?
Petrified_Discord: god awful characters
Petrified_Discord: In essence, linearity.
Bronysith: Wait a minute, you can ONLY go forward? :O
00,10nah just have not been chating
AJIsAwesome: EXACTLY
08,01sumica!
oh cool
That's just it. So many different reasons! XD
Petrified_Discord unlikeable/unreleatable characters and repetitive Combat
also ff7 had way too much grinding toward the end... knights of the round, and emerald/ruby weapon
Well that doesn't make any sense.......:S
I think JonTron's "Final Hallway" video describes this game PERFECTLY
Who's streaming?
Plot is fairly standard, maps are (mostly) straight lines, and the battle system lacks nuance, particularly early on in the game. At least, that seems to be the general concensus
SafariMonkey: Caramel.
Litwick: Hey...try and go left.
08,01i has a celestia blind bag!
well
RoboGerbil: emerald/ruby were optional tho.
Thanks AJIsAwesome
i has a bannana bag
Lucky!
Petrified_Discord: ...I cant go left.
00,10funny thing is RoboGerbil, the weapons were not in the orignal version of FF7
Litwick: Hey...try and go right.
His voice is different all of a sudden
00,10they were added for the US version
Petrified_Discord and yeah, way to linear, you litteraly walk down corridors... that's how maps are designed...
Petrified_Discord: ... I cant go right.
Litwick: Hey...try and play the game.
Just putting this out there, but how was only going forward a good decision for this game? :S
i beat emerald weapon once, but not ruby.. ever
Sumica where did you hear about that?
Petrified_Discord: I thought I was... but I was using the wrong controller the whole time.
guys, i know a game
AJIsAwesome: linear straight maps are becomming more standard with the rise of the FPS industry.
RoboGerbil: opposite for me
RoboGerbil: I made it a point to beat both weapons at least once just for the bragging rights, but otherwise they're not worth fighting.
00,10long time ago dont recall the site any more
Petrified_Discord: The game's playing itself Jon. THE GAME'S JUST PLAYING ITSELF JON! THE GAME'S JSUT PLAYING ITSELF JON!
Unnr: Okay.
Litwick: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Litwick: thats what i was thinking :D
Litwick JOHN!!! JoHN JOHN!!! AAAAHHHHHHH
And by weapons you mean the utlimate weapons right?
the object to your left is the only thing that wil stop the killer from killing you, what is it?
00,10yeah
so true
final hallway 13 is god awful game
If you ever want to do something amusing, try actually mapping out a standard plot-railed FPS map, and trying to figure out how it would work IRL
Ember: my m16
still, ff7:cc was pretty linear too but the combat system was fun, and the story was amazing
Hello, meow.
00,10ruby, saphire, ultmate, they were only ever seen in the cutscenes
twilight_sprinkle: IKR
Ember: An old tower pc
00,10there were not any kind of side boss
meow, right.
Ember: ...A door. I leave. XD
how are things Discord
Ember: Hack it to death!
at least this game's not as bad as Stairfax Temperatures
today I decided to begin reading homestuck.... I think I'm somewhere on picture/page 20 or so
twilight_sprinkle: A secret, I actually hate FFVII
Eh, good, but the statue's getting a bit dusty.
i has a piano
Unnr: why?
Hey Sonny
dont know if i've seen enough to judge yet, but this game looks kinda redundant
Hey everypony
hi
play him to sleep!
Huh. You think it would of been the other way around. Japan getting the extra bosses and us not.
Hey SafariMonkey :)
also I made a theme
Discord: Who are you calling dusty? :[
how are things Sonny
good alexxm
twilight_sprinkle: didn't like the characters, the story was boring, and the combat system was only so-so
hi Sonny :)
No one
++frfgtr
https://www.mychrometheme.com/t/f129kq8lqc12p8mo5yzvr1op7 meow, now look at my theme :c
Oh soz Sonny I gotta go
well discord, im calling your argument...
fuiouuii
rock solid
Unnr: That's more or less how I feel about 8 and 12
I'm just logging in to inform you that tonight I wont be at my dad's pc so I wont be on for long ;)
it's worst pony
jk.
Unnr: i havent played ff7, i only played ff7:cc
OMG?!
QUALITY GAME ON STREAM!?
We all know I hate Twilight, lol.
Sorry, my cat was trampling my keyboard :$
Who is playing FFXIII!?
Oh, this guy...he's funny for the first few times, but then got mildly annoying...
twilight_sprinkle: Compare it to FFVI or even FF IX, its a fairly meh game.
Huh? Rebels!
VenHur: You completed the game?
new element discoverd
Vordox: are you implying fallout and deus ex arent quality?
spuprise
suprise*
Dark_Horst: Depends on what "quality" is
Unnr: crisis core or ff7?
Vordox: No, I just watched Chuggaa's videos...
But I MIGHT played the game sometime..
VenHur: I played FFXIII
It's DAMN good
Just fans being pricks and spoiled
08,01oh how delightful, now my trousers also smell of cat piss
And I'm eagerly waiting for the third installment =3
Discord, what do you mean you hate Twilight? ;~;
Well...SHE TURNED ME TO STONE FOR FIRST :C
twilight_sprinkle: Don't own a PSP so haven't played crisis core, nor do I really want to.
Discord: Minor onconvinience?
did she just try to dump the black gy?
08,01i swear, if i was there tonight, we'd be having roast cat for dinner
You played Wrek?
...no, she did it on purpose :'(
and she made me sad :(
08,01heh, we'd be eating pussy...
Discord, in all fairness you did have it coming.
And I'm installing Gotham Imposters on steam :(
Unnr: in crisis core the combat system is different and i loved the story and the characters were amazing, adn the music, and the atmosphere, it was great
Discord: wasn't it celestia who turned you into stone first and afther that the main 6 characters of mlp fim?
No I didn't I was just sittign there ruling over my kingdom, but nooo, she had to ruin it.
Unnr: the characters were especially great
Yeah.
well the musics good
yes, "Planetary Annihilation" has reached 1,5mil Pledged, even more planet types :)
<_<
>_>
and also lie
Sonny, are you lying?
(lie)
08,01Lil_B: oh, trust me, it was worse for my boyfriend. i was making pussy jokes all week
(liar)
I forgot how to :c
/me kidnaps Discord
Good luck =P
I was actually sleeping in my overly comftrable bed just now
08,01in fact, i was making lots of terrible puns
:c get off me
:p
(PS: The game actually becomes hard at around 10 hours in)
it's so sooft /)^3^(\
alexxm, how you do that?
especially the never ending kind of puns
Ember i don't know
08,01his name is Koen, and i made one about "silly koen implants" before i left
I actually have ffxIII for ps3
=.(\
But I can't get past one bit
2,14 yeah, hard because they beef up all the monsters and expect you to use strategies they never teach you
Caramel: Oh so Caramel is playing? =3
ikr Caramel
Hey guys
hey Obsidian
Heya Obsidian
Obsidian: Hi! :)
hia Obsidian :)
how are things Obsidian
hi Obsidian
first! /)^3^(\
alexxm: Okay so far
Caramel: Oh they teach you, you just get TOO used to the lower level difficulty
btw Vordox I finished the Beanbag :)
good evening!§
haha yeah ikr Vordox
:p
n_n I've almost completed Sonic Generations
2,14 really? they teach you that the only way to kill the behemoths is to chain attack into the air so they never 1 hit kill you?
good evening Applejack2012
2,14 because I must have missed that tutorial
Lil_B: Not bad =3
Caramel: That difficulty spike :P
Hey everpony?
FF 13 ?
Vordox I haven't even shows it yet :|
Caramel is playing FFXIII?
Has there been any epic drawing recently that I missed out on?
GOD, those two are jaüanese
but I can't get past that one last boss :c
*japanese
TERRA and LAGUNA are best final fantasy characters
Lil_B: You want me to critic?
Oh hai Snow
Bronysith: and zach
sucky motto
Discord: Which one?
Has there been any epic drawing recently that I missed out on?
Time Eater
twilight_sprinkle: spin offs dont count
Vordox if it's ok for you, you know I never want to distract someone from something if he doesn't want to
Discord: Oh........okay.
I'm just watching stream, Eagerly awaiting for Caramel to probably suprise me. Probably
Nora, attaboy even though I'm a girl.
his boots sound liek a basketbalö
wait
2,14 surprise you with what?
Has there been any epic drawing recently that I missed out on? AJIsAwesome SafariMonkey?
seth green, im sure i heard him
Caramel: Quality gaming from your side =3
fucking umlauts, what do you want from me tonight
that guns bigger than she is
Discord: Use Sonic to destroy the debris and then boost into him. Also make sure to slow down and boost into rings.
2,14 quality ey? Then I'd better stop playing FF13 kekekekekeke
Sonny: Not really.
Caramel: Oh yo
you*
caramel just counter trolled discord
LIKE A BAWS!
AJIsAwesome: alrite' thanks
she be dancing
Dat instant own
I love games that value you for your combats.
Caramel: ever played Tales of? =3
real heroes dont need plans?
reeeaaal heroes dont have brains!
famous final words
real hero's do this
Ember: Real heros goes up and hits
LEEEEEEEEEEROY JEEEEEENKINS!!
why the fuck do they have a rating system in a final fantasy game?
WTF
Bronysith: Cause youshould get rated for your fights
2,14 because the game is full of fail
real heroes save a nuclear wasteland all on their own without sleeping a single night
Caramel: thank you!
2,14 and, funny enough, these battles don't even matter
who doesnt like getting stars??
2,14 you don't even get exp until later
nice music though
well, considering it is final fantasy, good music is a requirement
Caramel: So faster killings the better
then why have them
real heros fight like men and put up fists
(hidden reference there)
Bronysith: FFXIII had the better music, compared to some of FFXIII-2
did Uematsu do the music in this one?
then they proceed to die of radiation, get revived and free some kroe wastelabd
twilight_sprinkle: No
*more
mkay
It took me about 40 hours to get to the part where it get's nearly impossible while playing FFxii
2,14 Uematsu hasn't done FF since X
twilight_sprinkle Masachi Himazou mostly
which is what the last good one is, i hear :P
Caramel: Actually, he did a lot for FFXI Online.
twilight-sprinkle: No, I'm pretty sure he stopped doing Final Fantasy music after 10
the battles in this FF were kind of easy
what if...Uematsu is the only reason ff was good :O
Sonny: I loved FFXII<3
2,14 FF online doesn't exist and should never be mentioned
Yeah sure, it had flaws, but still enjoyable
Caramel: that bad? never played any ff
FFXI....? <.<
2,14 also...fail at a game that requires you to grind farm, yet limits how much you can farm in segments
FF online? whats that? 6_9
OH, that was the worst FF game ever.
i saw the ad for ff online, and now that i think about it, i havent heard a thing about it since then
At least that's what I heard.
Caramel: Sad truth of streamlined games. :(
Caramel: Hey-- I used to LOVE that game, my first MMO. Well, I loved it until it got so you waited 6 hours for a party...
Ember: FFXI. It was an MMO
Hey look cannon fodder
And isn't FFIV supposed to also be an MMO?
owait, or am i thinking about ff14
Gold_Demona: Still is. Mostly Japanese playing now, it's US presence is pretty dead.
So, what's this on the stream?
twilight_sprinkle: FFXIV yeah, FAIL of a FF
Is this one of those newer FF games?
MOMS ARE BADARSE
Kandarihu: FF XIII
Kencolt: After how badly FFXI did, I'm not surprised.
well I have to go now
just ask ellen ripley
ciao
Ah, so THIS is FFXIII
well, ive seen other kinds of moms
Bye Sonny
yeah, give the gun to the little girl
;)
BAD GIRL
running away from spiders
yes, give the assault rifle to the little girl
Dark_Horst: A time of war :P
ALL UNITED
WE WILL LIVE
motivational speach was not very effective
and then the little girl shot them all in the back as a joke
ANd then they all die of friendly fire
give 4 year old childeren guns! good idea!
Gold_Demona: Actually, it did pretty well. For a fw years, it was big for the MMO market. But the US contingent eventually moved to WoW, mostly, because of accessability and the fact that you no longer would need a party of 6 to level in it.
VANILLE YOU SUCK
and then the little girl tripped and splattered her brains over all of the other kids
/me slaps Bronysith
Dark_Horst: Like Starship Troopers?
Vordox: she and tidus are worst final fantasy characters
Vordox how do you do that?
Kencolt: Goes to show how much I paid attention. =/
music is repetetive too
Vordox: something like that
*repetitive
2,14 at least Tidus was supposed to be annoying
Ember: /me
2,14 Vanille is just something you want to throw down a meat grinder
who is vanille?
Caramel: what do you think of Terra?
Caramel: Give her time... she's a bitch nonetheless
Ember: type /me then what you want to say
Gold_Demona: I had a Mithra, had so much fun with her-- eventually capper her as a Monk. Monk was easy and fun. You LITERALLY just walked up to things and started hitting them.
vanille is the girl rite? i thought she was cute :3
2,14 bitch, don't be hating Terra
the one with the orange hair
well, the Fact that Tidus was supposed to be annoying doesn't make it better to have him around -.-
or was it pink
Caramel: im not, she is best character
Bronysith: Vanille MAY not be the best FF character, I agree. But she deserves not that much hate =P Just medium amount of it
laguna and cloud are my second favs
2,14 Lil_B: at least the game didn't FORCE YOU TO PLAY AS HIM -_-
Kencolt: My husband and I played FFXI for a little bit, but we got bored of it really quick cuz there's not a lot to do.
I played a little bit of FFVI this morning.
Bronysith: And SERIOUSLY, Tidus is worst char? XD
Caramel still... the laughing scene... and his generall stupidity in Cutscenes >.<
i should try a ff game i guess
what is this then?
Gold_Demona: You may have just hit a poor server-- I always found plenty to do for a few years. Then it started to die for US players...
OY Bronysith !
because of course gangsta style always works
Flyboy, FF 13
problem is, i only have a wii and a ds at home...
oh god... a jrpg...
well i'm outta here
IF THERE WAS NO Tidus, there would be no Balthier, I'm certain of it :P
are those stnadart military issue?
hm, that thing seems to have a cool design
wich one do you guys reccomend?
Kencolt: My husband and I never play with strangers, and they didn't exactly have much content for soloers.
Vordox: what? i said vanille is worst character
Cause FFX created the style of FFXII
Bronysith: Yeah but don't hate THAT much of Tidus :P
Gold_Demona: I see. Well, I just made friends in game. Worked for me.
Vordox: tidus is bad, but he is not the worst character
owait
AURON is also a good character
giant military batle mech thing? PUNCH IT!
Bronysith: Rikku?
Vordox: that too, tara strong <3
Kencolt: We kind of developed that attitude from playing Everquest. Too many stupid people on the internet, so we just avoid everybody. =/
Bronysith: Yep, gave millions of children/adolescent males boners :P
we got trouble! you dont say?
BAD ARSE MOMS
ded
Tough, but not invincible.
BAD ARSE MOMS Are also....dead..
not so tough now, eh?
awkward pose
Gold_Demona: Never played EQ... FFXI was my first and I played it on the PS2 and then the Xbox 360. (FFXI looked llike crap on the PC, but then the PC version was literally an afterthought.)
SHE ISNT EVEN HURT!
weeeeee
NOTHING HIT HER! NO INJURIES!
WE ALL STAND Uni...ted..?
Well feck
Perhaps not THAT united.
maybe shock wave?
living life on the edge
Dark_Horst, she was too close to the explosion.
still no injuries
I hope I get the new WLan Stick soon, I wanna see FFXIII getting streamed :)
She's...dead...
She shielded that other guy.
i cant hold on....we need to have a death to make the story sadder and more immersing!
Kencolt: Yeah, we had the PC versions, and I was not happy with the limited graphics capabilities on it. =(
ded
yes, but STILL NO INJURIES
btw, any more news on FF13-Versus?
and im freeeeeee
free falling!
twilight_sprinkle: Dead before being dropped
and then everyone died. The End
2,14 FORCED EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT ON PEOPLE WE DON'T KNOW NOR CARE ABOUT
bitch slap
Caramel: I HAVE A MOTHER! I CARE!
Caramel: YOU HATE YOUR MOM?!
tough choise
to save, or not to save
Gold_Demona: You could improve the graphics- it took registry tweaking. Me, I stuck with the consoles. Besides, it was designed with a controller and a USB keyboard in mind. And the keyboard was really for chat.
I don't even know that mother's name. But it was practically a worf effect there.
Caramel quality stroy Telling. 5 STARTS, A+, 4 Stars!!!!
Kencolt: Well, we only have 1 PS2, and it has no internet capabilities.
The thing is.
Kencolt: And we have no xbox. :P
There's CRAPTON of story in this
you dont know what the goverment gets away with
It just starts WITHOUT and introduction ><
2,14 there's a crap ton of information, not story
2,14 piling on tons of info is not a story
LIGHTING IS PLAYED BY KRISTEN STEWART
Caramel: Depends. :P Skyrim is the same
Gold_Demona: You also needed the HDD for the PS2. I got both. There's a certain pleasure to playing a MMORPG leaning back on your comfy sofa and chucking down a beer. (As opposed to now sitting at my PS and still chucking down a beer."
MECH INC
She seems so........lifeless and dull. :S
2,14 >implying Skyrim has much of a story
Caramel: Side stories = Rely on info
AJIsAwesome: thats called emotionless
Caramel: shit story sums up to, "you are chosen one, slay this dragon" stupid
Well, it's exposition.
yeah, but the thing is, you dont play bethesda games for story
Caramel: stupid story that is
you never did
AJIsAwesome: Not everyone is all happy happy =P
theres the war going on in skyrim
Kencolt: Yeah, I can see where that'd be more enjoyable. I've never played an MMO on anything other than a PC. :P
and you make your own story
THe only thing I like about this game are some of the enemy designs as well as the designs of the summons
the story in every bethesda game is COMPLETELY SECONDARY
Caramel: >implying any bethesda game has a story
oh i know her problem
twilight_sprinkle: And so far in FFXIII you have seen what? Happy land Festival? :P
oh yeah, Spony made a V-Log when he firast played FF13... he was really mad about how the Story is not told, but mostly only accesable via Textbooks. ... "Here, this new Area, I could give you some history about it, but you know... here is a book about it..."
Ember: I know, it's just that she's not really memorable.
she hasnt seen the magic of friendship :D
twilight_sprinkle: and if you are a nord, get shot once in the k nee and you have to give up on life
Bronysith: that joke is still horrible and you should still feel horrible
Bronysith: That joke is beyond dead...
Vordox: I'm just saying that I can't see her as a memorable character.
Kencolt: And I've played a handful of MMOs of varying quality
You know one game I have a problem with storywise? Custom Robo Battle Revolution. It basically waited until the last possible moment to explain the foundations of the world setting.
Kencolt: Except for WoW, oddly enough
how the fuck did he survive
LIGHTNING YOU SHOW NO EMOTION
AJIsAwesome: Well...
Dark_Horst: it was in the script
AJIsAwesome: You'll know once you see life from the other way of every other perspective :P
And the whole backstory was told in a MASSIVE infodump that gave players multiple quicksaves through it all.
oh god Hope
DIE DIE VANILEE DIE
<.<
VANILLE
It's Aerith and Rikku's lovechild!
oh jesus, she alrewady looks annoyunbg
i guess its pretty hard, to act emotionless as VA
Gold_Demona: ...That's...a really unusual observation
that kid looks like cloud, only less emo..yet
Vordox: :D
*so far
twilight_sprinkle: "Yet" :D
Kingdom heart?
nvm
twilight_sprinkle: Just wait, you'll cringe at ONE certain scene, perhaps Caramel knows which :D
wait, i know that name, cloud i mena
twilight_sprinkle: NO, dont you dare compare hope to cloud, cloud is much better in every way
Bronysith: cloud is gaaay
twilight_sprinkle: Oh just wait, he gets worse
im wondering if this story really makes any sense in japanese
Bronysith: and pointlessly emo
2,14 god, don't get me started
i know him from a movie
Is this the beginning of the game moreorless?
Caramel: Where he "Grows" :D
Vordox: when is the scene?
Caramel: Is it coming up soon?
2,14 this game makes Cloud look like a motivational speaker
twilight_sprinkle: Who knows. :P
Caramel: LOLOLOLOL!
Caramel: hahahahaha XD
twilight-sprinkle: Cloud CAN be gay, if you play the game right.
what the fuck idiot?
Caramel good one XD
Gold_Demona: No
...WHAT THE FUCK PHYSICS
Well that was convinient
Caramel: terra is still best final fantasy character, i still like cloud, but laguna is just so....laguna
Gold_Demona: oh yeah, the dating bit :D
