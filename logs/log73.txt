Gay scenes on TV isn't really controversial here any more.
6that's actually....next week o.o
I just made mini fanfic.
07hurr
11congrats, Nittany.
6I'M OK WITH THIS
11We don't even have Lesbian television over here. >.>
lol I guess it doesn't come up when I'm in the US a lot.
Wow.
But can I interest you in Kaboom?
6dude kyu
6go post in initiation
6we've been waiting for you
Series 1 finale.
11Yeah, people in this country are too freaking uptight about sexuality.
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
02Roara I have a question
6yes?
6I have an answer
6maybe
02Have you ever seen Summer Wars?
12no
6no
11And you just hit the problem on the head, RobotPinkie
02Hmm, all right.
But most people support gay marriage, I thought
what an astutely mild observation
07hurr
07but ok I guess
This is the series finale now guys.
Be ready for the awesome. :D
Here I am again.
I'm watching!
IT'S A TRAP!
They couldn't resist putting that in once more.
ITS A TRAP!?
07er
07o3o;
I've heard of it
We're a lot looser about it like the UK, but very few TV shows can be proud to say 100% Canadian
02Yeah?
sounds like a cool movie
Well, I guess you have to pander to your base...
but I never got around to seeing it
Which sucks
is it any good?
I want boobies all times of day without having to PPV
Lolz.
11Fuck the base. They're elected to make the right decision, and that's what they should do.
Dat nudity
...
11dat ass?
Not a fan of having two political blocks
02Yes, it's really good.
6gonna be migrating houses again soon
wat
Honestly, I see greed as a larger problem in this country than religious conservatism. In either way, people don't want to change.
/me should see it, then
11Walking nude around the house. Like a boss.
It's the rapture!
When Republicans would rather undermine the basis of the US govt than to give up their tax cut, things are off.
BRINGING EVERYONE TO THE PRESENT TO JUDGE THEM ALL AT ONCE
11End of Days is a schwarzenager movie.
02Yes!
02And all right Roara
Is what going on in October? :o
I predict that people will predict the end of the world until the end of the world.
11lol, Dari
11A bible-thumper was going around saying the world would end May 22nd or sometime around then.
That dude that calculated the rapture was wrong.
Yeah, that was a nice rapture party, though
11When May came and went, he said that was the "silent judgement" and the real demise would be in October.
I love the end of the world
And another embarrassment to my belief.
I get to party because the world is going to end
DAMMIT, YA CAUSED A TIME PARADOX!
I get to party because the world is ending
and then I get to party because the world didn't end
11I don't mind any religion, as long as it's not getting shoved in my face.
@FlutterHi Do I get to party too?
I don't shove my religion (belief) in people's faces.
@Denied_Existence HEELLLLLSSS YEAHHHH
11Especially when it comes to political issues where religion doesn't belong.
=]
~yay~
lol
Kind of like something else...
Wait, so...
@Jesusmeter Twilight Sparkle
6 Twilight Sparkle is 81% Jesus. (1110)
brb going downsatairs
I think that religion is usually a good thing and that the intention behind it is good, though I'm not religious myself.
11Agreed, Dari.
It's the extremists that give religion a bad name.
It's sad that my religion is on the chopping block. Now I know how muslims feel.
11The problem comes when people use religion to do meaningless things because it's "what their god would want"
LOL JACK
wheee
12evil day
12VERY evil day
12oxo
hi
11Muslims are good people. My family is friendly with a muslum family.
I wonder how many moderate to "liberal" Muslims are persecuted over here because their extremists friends over in Iran want to nuke us.
;o

12lol Kyu

People say cartoons in the 90s were awesome
I tend to agree, but whenever my mind wanders to Looney Tunes
Nothing compares to the voice talent of Mel Blanc, the directorial skills of Fritz Freling et al.
Looney Tunes was like... the golden age of cartoons
Indeed
As a child, I always wondered how Bugs would get that barber seat down from that height
he'd have to climb that pole all the way up again

Rofl, Robotpinkie
or maybe not, because then I have to be stuck with The damn Wonderbolts
dubtrotmasterxbigmac im no good at coming up with a good fanfic
actually i was writing Soipony's story so that ReticentSmolder wouldn't have an excuse not to write his Silvermanes stories
Ah
lol
04bed
04may be on, most likely not
you know, for the number of filliesin the show, and number of colts on here, why do we get so much gay clopfics?
Because everyone is gay in Equestria.
lol who knows
but why doesn't anyone try to ship with the fillies?
Why else is there so little straight shipping among the mane 6?
idk
because there are only two colts in the show who are around enough?
cuz there is so few colts with actual roles in the show
/me doesn'T have a ponysona and don'T need one.
Prince Blueblood doesn't count, for obvious reasons.
Dermathil is no a grumpy earth pony.
>give it time
Everyone just hates him.
is now*
pretty much, unless you extrapolate forever with Big Mac, Spike, Braeburn, or Prince Blueblood, you have to make an OC pony for straight shipping
yup
uh? you think I'm a grumpy earth pony?
I have no ponysona either... I only have ponies.
Hmm...

/me runs
12lol
12sigh
12i don't know if i want to call Hydreigon good or not
12nice attack and HP, but horrible energy cost and weakness
12True
12But a pretty good card overall
12The weakness part is the worst XD
12considering how popular donphan is
12and what donphan does to Hydreigon for a single energy and a couple pluspowers
12not to mention the appearance of pokemon catcher is going to wreck everything
12yeah
12they may not even be able to get Hydreigon out
12I don't think they can o-o
12if you are going to play stage 2s in this format after catcher comes out
12they need to be swarmable
12yep
o_O so much blue text
12Blue is awesome though :3
12We need to get in all the others that use blue text as well XD

I'ma back
Hey mom'
Hello Uxie
10Color
10Guys?
6LIFE
6*hugs_DSD*
10Yes
6Wow..I haven't seen you on here in ages..
6And hey Uxie! ^^
10*Hugs* C7
11Hola!
6^^
10I was moving
6How've you guys been? ^^
6:O
11I know! :)
10i got on to see you guys
10i have been good
11Okay! :)
10can't wait till the new spyro
6Good to know ^^
11Yeah, me too!
6I wanna see what it's like.. :O
11I've seen two pre-release gameplays on YouTube. The game looks fun!
11It's just too bad many people are refusing to try it out
10well the wii and 3ds might not be the same as the rest
10yea
11That's right
heya Skylands
10hiya
11I think the haters only want the classic series
6They should give it a chance at least..
10I don't think I'll be at that meeting today
10Just letting you know
11Yes, but they'd rather whine at the trailers than check out the walkthroughs
6I'm not that crazy about it so far but I think it might be quite good..
Heh well, I think it was yesterday and it didn't even happen
11Yep, it's got some awsome music and backgrounds.
10ohlol
10I kept thinking it was a Thursday for some reason
6:O
6It comes out in November,right?
11I just hope that the game can get at least 33% of the faux-fans to try it out
10oh i'm on my laptop
11October 18th
10well
11I understand
6:O
10September for US and EU and October 18th for AU
10And Q4 for the rest
11Hm, maybe
10which means near november
11Hey, DSD, thought of any stories yet?
10getting a thought going to go watch some videos today and you?
6Anyway..I think I'll watch some videos before I actually decide I want to get it..I probably will though at some point.. :3
6brb
11Nope. Not a single plot... yet!
11The stonger the hatedom, the more fans these stories will get. Trust me
11Baised on the ratings for the trailers, around 12% of them are true fans. The rest are the haters who just whine
02*WB03(Skylands03)02WB* - <Skylands> 10Apparently I saved myself a memo last night titled "cake" and all it says is "I love it so much"
10yea
11Maybe some of the stories should focus on other characters as well as Spyro.
11One should focus on Sheila, one on Sgt. Byrd, one on Elora. You know what I mean
10yea
10maybe a split story
11Yeah.
10like a story about SGT Byrd and another Story about Sheila
11Good one
10so tht way we can get more stories
hello everybrony.
11We should also do one for a few world-baised stories, such as Skelos Badlands
10Yea
10So where should we put these after we are done on DA?
Hey! Dermathil!
/me waves back.
11I don't know
I haven't drawn anything more, by the way
11We've lost our forums at the Spyro Wiki (thanks to some Russian)
I was about to ask!
10we could there is a good fan base there
>herdmind for the xth time
all day erry day son. but yea, I'm sorry i haven't drawn any more yet
11Okay, but not at Spyropedia. We would start our own topic for stories at our wiki once it's editable again
10oh wait
6Back
11Okay
10The DA i made
Dunno if you heard, but my dad now has custody over me and i moved country and now suddenly my dad says we actually have a wedding to attend on saturday, and we had to buy a bed and build it, and tidy my room and the house in general
and AAAAAAAAAAAAA
so much going on
10This is what it was made for
11I know, but I don't know how to write fanon stories at DA
10i do know

10truth be told do yuo think we can work with Spyropedia?
11I think so
11But no one's been active apart from myself, and some person who created warning templates
You'll be fine =]
11At the moment, we need the spites for the characters of Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure
11We currently have none, in contrast to the Spyro Wiki.
!sneas
/me still belongs to Skylands for 28 more minutes
10well
11http://www.darkspyro.net/
):
11Maybe we can get some here?
10see i was hoping Darke had moved everything over
11No. In fact, she's not been active for weeks
11We've yet to obtain the Eliment images
10http://www.darkspyro.net/skylanders/
10Dang
11Right there as we "speak"
10are they canon?
10the names
11I think so
11This gives out a lot of infomation
11The eliment names are canon
10yea
10even Aura didn't have any images on this
11True
6Ok,screw it..I really can't play TS2 anymore.. ._.
11Hm? The elements remind me of Final Fantasy XII...
10why?
10yea
10They do
11Sims 2?
11I've not played that for two years
6I'm gonna try fixing TS3..I can't go back to TS2 now.. -._
11...and I never want to play it again!
6*._.
6Yeah..Why not? D:
11Privite matters
10?
10oh ok
6I think I'm going to have to re-install the whole thing.. ._.
6Oh
10whats the ts stand for?
6The Sims
11I refuse to know the names of all Sims (for now)
11A certain family will damage me
6What do you mean?
10$7.99 each, there will also be larger packs containing three characters.
10ok
10damn
6Gah..I really don't know if I should re-install the whole thing..
11Two years have gone by, and a family damaged my happiness.
10I'm going to need to sell a kidney
6D:
10i want Spyro Halo and MW3
6:O
6I want Spyro and MW3 as well.. ._.
10yea the price of games
11I refuse to speak their names, or their hometown. It's a pre-made family that put a scar in my heart
6Including MW2,Black Ops and Brutal Legend..
6DDD:
^_^
also AE, SC :B
/me 6makes a folder
10i have mw2 and Black ops
10http://www.toysrus.com/shop/index.jsp?categoryId=11202423 Uxie behind the goblin
6Atm I have CoD4 and the Black Ops demo.. ._.
10thats a canon characters
06x3
10i need CoD4
06Everybody wants some AE
6What's the red dragon at the end? :
6*:O
10not sure
yesh :3
6I wish CoD4 was compatible with Dualshock 3.. ._.
10if all of them are toys then theirs like 6 dragons
6I like the little skull dude on the right :3
11Goblin?
6Oh carp..I need to sort the A7x pics again..
11That's a red dragon. But what's his name, I wonder?
10not sure
12especially you ;o
/me runs
10hm
11There's only one female that is known: Stealf Elf
10is DS is a 3ds only character i need to get the 3ds and play him on the 360
10like $700 just for spyro
11The characters can be used for all versions
10and $800 for everything mw3 spyro and halo
10well some think DS will be a character that comes with the 3ds and thats the only way to get him
11Who knows
11When will ShouldWiki become editable again?
11I've already lost patiance
10i'm not sure
11That's that?
11I think that by time they are finished, SSA would have already been released
6 800$? Wtf ? o.o
10yea
10yes
6Why?
10C7 watch the vid
10well
11$800?
10maybe around 500$
10well if the figures are 7$ each
6xD
10and 99 C
11I hope it will only cost around $500 in Australia
/me catches
6:O 99?
10and like 100$ for the game
6Is that offically how many there are?
11But in Australia, the price is normally higher, like around $12
10yes
6I'd say the game would be about 70-80..
11Maybe
11I can get all figs, unless it's more than $20 per fig
/me 10wants akilljoy like mc
6I'll probably only get the ones that come with the game..
11How many I'll get depends on the game's exitment
6Can you give me two three-digit numbers?
/me starts to write again.
11?
yay~
10well it's not going to be cheap
6Like 555 or something.. :P
10maybe
10lets see
/me is immediately drawn off by another youtube video
11Might
this shit is amazing
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-myMEB40Hg
6Basically the 555 was about the thing I said before.. :P
10$231.71
10thats for toys
06Well... true enough
so, Dman, why couldn't you participate to the D&D session that's begining to take shape with silvermane as the DM?
10say the game is 70 or up it will be about $300
11Yep
06:3
6Meh.. .-.
: /
I needed to go to bed y/day
6I'll probably have to wait 5 years till the price goes down enough..
how far in is it? (i mentioned it in the channel, but i've never played D&D, yet i've seen about 10 games before)
Still in character creation.
I'm the only real veteran player.
11Maybe, but the hatedom might put it to $5 (per figure) by this time next year
Ah, maybe i'll be able to still play
/me pulls his dice pouch out
that vid is quite funny
yeah
10then it would be $171.73
it was a trololol vid but it caught me completely off-guard
6I guess it's time to make copies and uninstall the game.. ._.
haha same just now
11Okay
6This sucks so bad.. ._.
10which comes to about 250$
btw, the guy who liked that vid on his youtube page is a let's player who has a machinima series. and just below that vid's like there's epic cupcakes time.
(I think that LPer is a brony)
(he also liked the fluttercussing vid)
(sounds like a brony :P)
http://www.youtube.com/user/PaperBatVG#p/a/u/2/kFRGWo32aJg
11Just be very thankful you did not become over-addicted to one pre-made family like I did
10which is about 70
he's canadian, too
10less
Morning everypony
10oh thats right
6I wanna ask my friend about it but Idk what exactly to ask.. .-.
hey RDash
Mornin' RDash
11That nightmare is now a part of the darkness in my heart, which I hope will disappear forever, soon
6Meh..I usually tend to get kinda addicted..
Hi Dermathil and Dman
10Darkness?
Oh hai
6What I really hate is when I do a whole lot of stuff and then the game decides to crash and close down so I lose everything I've done.. ._.
hey Ziltoid. I'm on #ponies&Dragons btw
The fluttercussing video isnt that bad at the beginning :P
and hey there Ziltoid
Dermathil - i didn't know that
alright
Hey Ziltoid
11Yeah, tha's a nightmare
10But I've learned... that deep down there's a light that never goes out!
The voice matches fluttershy's mouth exactly
11That's right! But I sure wish I could free that light
I think it's hillarious
Word
Adjective
6I had this other evil happen on Infamous 2..I accidently overwrote the wrong file..Now I lost whatever I had done in that file and I had done pretty much everything.. ._.
yeah
Yo, Uh. Word. Adjective. Pronoun. Adverb.. Run on and on and on.. Where my gerunds at? . Parenthetical, uh.
And then the cussing begins
10Darkness is the heart's true essence.
Haha, yea
6I want Cheetos..
11WARNING: This is the reason why I lost my love for the Pride Lands
11There is an unknown history connecting all this
6Lol.Now it's copying all the custom content I've downloaded.
6o.o
10unknown i know
6My friend's not answering.. ._.
11This family destroyed me, and I was only 14. The Pride Lands played a small, but important role in this
6I think I'll get some A7x on the radio..
11I refuse to state who, or why, this happened
6What are the Pride Lands?
10Uxie if you want to tell her i
11A world in Kingdom Hearts II
10ill back you up
6Oh
Skylands
11Thanks, but I cannot let much of it become known, otherwise I'll be destroyed forever
10Shes had a hard life
rematch using my favourites team that I just threw together?
10No matter what i'll stand by your side
11Thanks
6*hugs*
11*hugs back*
10*Hugs* uxie
6^^
11Thanks. :)
10Even if your don't others have forgiven
11Who I am today is not who I was then
11That's true
10the you then is dead
10the you today is new
11My present self is happy; my past self lies in the darkness in my heart
6Gah..the old dates get erased.. D:
10well we me here you will never have to deal with your past alone
10*with
11That's true
6That's better..Dates saved. ^^
10Sure
6Time to uninstall.. T.T
11My past self will always be in the shadows, and will be destroyed should the true light return
6If this doesn't work either..Idk..I'll probably break something..

they don't make lotteries anymore, remember?
I mena
they don'T make a list in ponychan for the names in the lottery
*mean
I know there's no lotteries, but there's still /chan/ threads
suggestions etc
and I know, now they take all the active members in the bronystate channel
I was there, as were you ^_^, when they announced this
I just can't find their ponychan thread
11DSD?

6Freedom to be bored ftw?
10october 16th for the us
11Okay!
hey ziltoid, dermathil, why not write a fanfic based on the D&D game here at bronystate?
11So, I wonder why some people think Darkness should be destroyed?
6Is it the same for EU as well or a bit later?
11I think it cannot be destroyed
12Meowing Lugia = THE END OF THE WORLD!!!!
it isn't with ponies, so it would be a probably useless idea IMO
hey RBD
Oh, it's Rainbrodash
0...*sighs* I wish Icy was here...
Ohai there Rainbrodash
6Hooray for invisible writing!
6._.
6Hey

6Tf?

o.o?
morning gentlecolts
c ya
oh Hey there ValtheJean
I hate essays
howdy Dman
howdy
lol PO crashed
I'd like to go on record that Google Chrome is a malicious bastard who's sole purpose is to torment me
: /
Chrome's almost mai waifu, so why's that?
03iiiiiiiiiiii
what's up with you and Chrome?
well
I'm trying to make a theme for Sathi
but the damn template wont let me adjust images and whatnot
it just loops them like a complete retard
: /
so I have to manually adjust image sizes for it to fit
the problem: is that if you use a different resolution, or have a larger monitor than me, it fails miserably
11That's true
raaarwwrwrgfgjlkdsgpfogl;
and that's what bad themes have : / good themes have that featureythingy where any resolution works
yeah
which is why Google Chrome is purposefully tormenting me
: /
10maybe
10i don't know
10it seems we are working ourselves done
that was weird...
anyone else have that chat crash?
11We might
10*Down
11At least TTE is still active at Bulbapedia, sometimes
not me
it happens sometimes to somepeople
happened to me before
ohai ValtheJean Not to me
weird
howdy RDash
FireFox ftw
:P
agreed
stupid chrome being stupid...and evil
10yea
11Maybe we should only contact him when we need an admin's help.
11Currently, we need to create pages and gather images ready for SSA
10yes but a lot of it is locked for admins only
11Some templates are not needed to be edited yet
:/ I prefer Chrome still
Yay! Almost home from sailing trip :3
11The one for the worlds does, as it's not been updated for Spyro: A Hero's Tail
alright back
howdy Dermathil
Sup Dermathil
Hey dermathil

see ya later Dman
11But how can we reach TTE? I don't want to create an account on Bulbapedia
10idk
10i'm not sure
11Maybe we should just leave a message on his talkpage, then wait seven days for a reply?
10or we edit like crazy then ask for admins
11?
10like i said
10we work with what we have
10then move up
10like a job

/me refreshes his emailbox for the first time of the day.
The best fanfic ever being written
/me chokes on his pepsi
You can't be serious. That title belongs to Fallout: Equestria!
35chapters and counting!
It's quality, not quantity! 13 chapters and counting
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/07/story-past-sins.html
Wait, how long are the chapter then, eh?
But Fallout: Equestria is both Quality AND Quantity!
(in general the FO:E chapters are over 10K words each)
11Do you like Simpsons?
and it currently is the most popular post in the EqD sidebar.
No other fic is in there.
11Just wondering, as I found some episodes online
Check two posts down
derp
lol
herpyderpderp
Sonic Rainderp
I just noticed something in the season 2 screenies post: the 2nd picture has, on the right monitor, the very same post on EqD (recogniseable due to the 1st picture being seen in that screen)
Yea, in the twitter post they said "Us looking at us"
<mfw theres an for add for an amusement park on my banana
06i'm away for 8 little days
lol
06and THIS:
06http://www.speedtest.net/result/1417319545.png
0.0 I wonder how that advertizing method is working for that park?
13Reminds me of my connection speed
/me wonders if Silvermane will show up before 7PM EST tonight. Silvermane is a D&D DM for a brony campaign!
06not cool, my speed is 20 Mb/s, and im above 120% FASTER then the average of NL
O_o
06router and modem need a reset
a brony DnD game?????
yeah
me gusta....
Yep, its over at #ponies&dragons
ValtheJean: it is just a normal D&D game with bronies who are the players.
06BBL, resetting bthat darn thing >.>
06.-.
what ruleset do you guys use?
the 3.5
wewt
that's the best one
(I am happy it isn't 4.0)
eeyup
06how is that connection in the top 7% o.o
Silvermane's the DM, but I am the only Veteran D&D player who'S gonna be a player right now
so can anyone jump in, or is there a sign up sort of thing?
we are still at the character creation phase
(I also discovered yesterday that I got a slew of AD&D books)
>is totally going to ask silver if I can join >.<
you also a vet player?
/me is wondering when we will hear the rest of that story
yeah
10>has never played DnD >.>
DM'd a few times
nice.
it's REALLY fun RainBrodash
10I know, I've seen it happen
I think my favorite character I made:
Also, we all be lvl 1
he was a human Samurai with REALLY low Strength and Constitution scores
wait who was on this morning
but, he had really high Dexterity and Charisma
Why do so many bronies do DnD?
so he was basically assigned the role as our group's representative
were nerds
D0rky stuff?
Dubtrotmaster got it right.
BECAUSE IT'S FUCKING AWESOME
Also, it's not really a game is it? It's just RPing, right?
depends
it depends on how you WANT to play it
10>papercraft spitfire
10WANT
How do you have fights...
dice rolls
/me want to know when will we be able to hear the rest of that story dari?????
10and dari it's a game in the same way a text based MMO is a game, but inb4 you don't call that a game
lol, well I could go into the entire details of initiative and whatnot, but it's just turn based combat
^^
It's different, that's automated, preset story and everything.
This is people making up a story and acting it out through text.
lol, what did you think people did without computers?
they rolled dice
Remember when I spoke of the movie CUBE?
most modern rpg's today are just computer generated die-rolls
My old DM made a dungeon based off that movie.
friendship is sexy is very nice....just sayin
DnD is like, totally ,like black magic man
oh man, anyone ever played World of Darkness?
not that I know of.
that game, is fucking epic
basically
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0123755/ (the movie I'm speaking of that my old DM made a dungeon based off of)
it's dnd, but with vampires
they even made a video game based off of it
he had simplified it alot, but even then we were stuck for a whole IRL day.
(Vampire Masquerade: Bloodlines)
AH
rings a bell then.
I may have played a game of it once.
it's REALLY memorable
But it was a short game.
because there's a lot less emphasis on die-rolls and pure stats
the abilities are much more generalized and open for interpretation
so basically, you can do all sorts of crazy shit if you're clever enough
Valthejean: makes me think of a marvel paper rpg I played once.
don't think I've played a marvel rpg, but it sounds like it could be good
you was a super hero and you could use your chosen powers any way you wanted as long as it fit within the vaguely described powers.
For example, you got an air manipulation power? Alright, make a bubble around an enemy's head, remove all the air from the bubble.
lol
Hi
yeah, that's kind of like the stuff you could pull off in WoD
howdy Barry
hello barry
How are you guys?
not too bad, how about yourself?
I'm doing good
(I had elemental manipulations in that marvel RPG (which used colored stones as power points that you had to spend each turn to decide what strength your use would be)
So my character manipulated air, water, earth and fire.
hehe...avatar
And with manipulation came changing body into an elemental.
think you can turn into a puddle of water while sneaking in a place.
I was watching a Dr. Who episode yesterday, and I noticed that if the Doctor is killed in the middle of his regeneration cycle, it's disrupted, and the cycle breaks
But I just joined chat D:
youre on season 5?
Or, for even sneakier infiltration, turn into a gust of air.
which isn't due to air until late August
thats what I meant season 6
is it me...or does anyone miss the good old days of THACO?
derp
THACO?

I love tacos

9It's a fictional food

13That's actually a bit higher than it normally is
06www.speedtest.net/result/1417363221

9the game is called Snatcher
06www.speedtest.net/result/1417363221.png

06I just want your ping LU then I'm

06Lol
Ro-ro-ro-roara
06and Espeon....honestly....i dont even know what that is xD
13ohai Roaraaaaaa :D

/me now belongs to Aurora for 11 minutes
/me already belongs to you, silly :P
<3
06:3
06seriously Xeli,,,,,i NEVER heard what a PING is or so.... never worked with it, so i dont have a clue
ooohhhh....miso soup...yum...
That actually sounds interesting
13I don't know what a ping is, either
13|D
06ping is basically response time, in games high ping = lag
9it can actually be made with different combinations
06my ping used to be 0
/me flees
I'm going to bed
06Night
06<3
9I'm going to try Chicken Noodle + Combination Pizza cause I'm poor
06BEFORE THIS PIECE OF SHIZZZ DECIDED TO DIE ON ME >.<

9http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BMybKPY1GE
it's 3:30am xD
06lol LU your ping is appearently 0 secs, but the ctcp ping probably doesn't count anything smaller than seconds
You can get some Miso soup cheaply
Just go by an asian restaurant/fast food place
06also lol 34 ping .w.
9none in my area
...lol
9well, not that sell Miso Soup at least
Wantan soup might work
o-o
9I think I'll go with Chicken Wonton Soup
9I think I have some of that Campbell's Soup
06hey Xeli, if i'll CTCP Ray with his Winternetz when he's back in Venezuela....can i laugh?
06I assume the winternets are sarcastic? :P
now I suddenly have a craving for some Pei-Wei
06Ray's idea :D
I had 2 minutes and 43 seconds lag yesterday
06lol
06i had a 10 Minute lag once
06but then i realised
06my router needed to make place for another
06:3
06Netgear? NEVER take a netgear router >:
/me has a netgear router

/me now belongs to Link for 34 minutes
/me still belongs to Aurora for 3 more minutes
/me now belongs to Link for 13 minutes

06have low ping
06you WILL do well in CoD
/me hides

06i never play Cod
13Cod is a fish

Such a striking difference in what we are doing this morning versus what we were doing late last night.
06the lag compensation is on crack or something
06only multiplayer would be Starcraft2 and TF2
06if you get host (console-wise) you could as well be lagswitching
06And I rarely do myself, sometimes I do though. Mostly tf2 and lazy though
06hm
06i HAVE a LAN-Cable inserted....but it says i only have local acsess >.<
Haha, ya D_E
ahh i see i've been nickalerted :P

06my lag is 18ms...
06hm...
06but my other PC has a lag of 6ms....
06LAN-Cables FTW
i doubt ill ever play TF2

13craptop? :3
lol well, steam + my laptop dont really mix well
PLUS, Im missing an Up arrow key
06replace it with a corn bit
/me runs
13How is it possible to lose keys on a keyboard? o-o
they break off?
06I could make your TF2 so minimalistic graphics wise that it would make you feel like a hipster
/me diesd
06nooo!
06dead floof!
/me does CPR on Espoen
LOL just turn TF2 into an 8-Bit game
06*Espeon

13How can they break off though, when you're lightly pressing down on them while typing o-o
cleaning the keyboard?
Heh, only you, I, and a few others here have any idea...
06once happened to me but I had gotten something stuck behind the key and getting that thing away didn't end well =w=
MUAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Or something
13Just wipe the keyboard with a cloth? |D
06o got special equipement for cleaning my Keyboard!
now goodnight for real
06you know...toothbrush...paper....towels....clothing....
13But if you're careful, the keyboard will hardly ever get dirty to begin with |D
06but i eat cookies all the time
06how can i keep my Keyboard clean then?
XD
13I eat food at my computer all the time too, I just keep the food away from the keyboard and wipe my hands before typing :B
wtf
/me whistles

9>mfw nobody cares anyways because my fic is not very well rated xD
/me did not know you had a fic
Linkers?
I'd offer to support you, but I cannot abide the honorable name of Caramel to be placed in fanfics :P
9b-but Val
9is it really that bad to have badass Caramel in a story?
I WILL NOT ABIDE THE CORRUPTION OF CARAMEL!
However awesome Kamen Riders are :P
...
9I'm surprised you're bothered about that and not by I-matured-a-lot-in-three-year's-time Snails
9also RDash: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/03/story-wyburn.html Act 04 is already in my dA
hey hey, let's get one thing straight here :P
I dislike all fanfics in general
9the unlabeled chapter, "Wyburn", is an optional prequel
Ah, thanks
hence why I am so protective of my husabando appearing in one :P
9then it wouldn't be technically disliking fanfics, but more like
9"I don't read them"
But ValtheJean, don't you want Caramel to be famous? That's his lifelong dream
He is a content pony who tries to live a normal life!
He wasn't meant for such things!
9TOO BAD FOR YOU I HUMANIZED HIM FOR THE SAKE OF THIS FIC : 3c
9AND I ALSO DREW HIM
O_o
you
YOU SON OF A BITCH
MUAHAHAHAHAHAHA
words...there are no words
/me 9trollfaces (and expects you to forgive him thanks to his somewhat okay drawing skills)
Well...your still saying words...

They've rennovated since then

9*shrug* In my fic, there are two worlds. When humans go into Equestria, they turn into ponies, and if ponies go into the human world, they turn into humans. And so on.

/me wants to go into Equestria to turn into a pony
/me loads a flash drive containing caramel clop fiction into his drive gun.
9well, more like "SCIENCE-FICTIONALLY" plausible, but yeah
DONT MAKE ME USE THIS
err sorry, that was aimed at RDash, not you DCD
9OH U
Denied, I would like to mention that should you do such a thing, there is no force in the entire galaxy that can stop the homicidal purge I would begin
9.....
Wait, did you say Caramel is your husband
/me is serious
Husabando
(male version of waifu)
/me reloads his guns

hey man, I'm gar for Caramel
@pony ValtheJean's waifu
6 ValtheJean's waifu is 5A8ce
Muahaha, Caramel isn't on @pony yet
NewDCD, my theory is when we die, the energy from our brains is released and reaches above-light speeds
/me 9makes a Caramel sock puppet....
YES!^
@NewDCD *SQUEEEEEEEE*
/me 9then proceeds to make him the Village Bicycle http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/d5ab5bdf43b735afce8a883a07ef71e8/29470%20-%20applejack%20coolface%20fluttershy%20mane_six%20pinkie_pie%20rainbow_dash%20rarity%20template%20trollface%20twilight_sparkle%20u_mad.png
Thereby, the brain-waves can then jump through the 9th dimension
....
I WILL FEED YOUR GALL BLADDER TO MY CAT
Denied_Existence And into Ponyville?!?
9http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_thumbs/2e3e576711bf5ad8cdf302bed48da093/thumb.jpg
:D
fyi, if NewDCD is suddenly "not available" tomorrow, you'll all know why
When our brainwaves jump through the 9th dimension, they reappear in a universe completely different from our own
This continues into infinity
Therefore, yes, you might eventually wind up in equestrian.
Equestria.
Denied_Existence 'might' is not good enough
Well...you will be doing this an INFINITE amount of time
's
But infinity is too long to wait!
@meter Chance RDash will make it to Equestria
6 Chance RDash will make it to Equestria is 6% . (1170)
Oh NO!
Well...then we have to factor the possibility of a 'god' into the equation.
10>implying god exists
10:trollface:
andherewego.gif
10^ :P
If there is a "God" then it is possibility that "god" is controlling the flow.
10;_______________;
We are doing this scientifically man!
[18:52] <ValtheJean> IF HE SULLIED THE GOOD NAME OF CARAMEL I AM GOING TO SKIN HIM ALIVE AND THEN WEAR HIS COAT
That's next on my list bro.
;)
O_o
9no seriously guys no religious stuff. That's an inevitable shitstorm
We are determining the likeliness of your brainwaves jumping into a pony universe!
This is purely science!
I warn you Dari...none of my enemies are alive
oh wait...except one

Maybe i didn't say every single syllable,but yeah i said them!
I came cupcakes.
My computer also has horrible grammar
So we have NewDCD PONY PENETRATION and now Dari with EVERYPONY CAME.

....HOW OFTEN DO YOU PEOPLE READ CLOP HERE!?
IS THIS SOME KINDA CONTEST!?
oh dammit, now I regret getting ready for work yesterday.
I wanna hear Dari's voice again <3
or this morning, whatever
More often than we should. >_<
CONTEST?CHALLENGE ACCEPTED!
Clopping contest?
Pegacorn, you are banned from the contest.
What kind of contest? :3
only mods are allowed to read clopfics
This is relevant to my interests
violators will be shipped on sight
RobotPinkie COME ON INTERVIEW YEAH!
Banned?
No, just shipped
/me throws a football at Dashite
with Snails
/me catches the football and runs to the endzone!
/me eats Dashite as a victory statement.
I... don't really have a response to that...
/me uses VioletVanilla's cupcakes to recover Dashite's DNA!
What a story VioletVanilla.
/me begins cloning Dashite.
Which story Pegacorn?
Whoa, my head hurts...
What the hell?!
Who are you?!
What do you mean, who am I?! Who are you?!
@VioletVanilla:You eating Dashite
I'm Dashite!
No, I'M Dashite!
Bullshit!
NO
I AM DASHITE
You're nametag says you're a clone!
@Pegacorn Lol, and now we have a disaster on our hands!
/me plugs Dashite into a mental recovery positron.
I am he as you are he and you are me and we are all together?
/me turns on the positronic brain.
WHAT?!
/me waits.
But, I can't be a clone...
/me turns off the positronic brain.
/me rips the positron off.
Get that crap off me!
.....?
....
/me pulls out Pyro's flamethrower and burns the Dashite clones
I need to get stuff done before summer ends
DAMMIT PEGACORN, DONT FUCK WITH MY CLONING MACHINE AGAIN THIS TIME
WE DONT NEED MULTIPLE CLONES OF YOU
/me stomps the cloning machine to bits
What happens if you fuck with a cloning machine?
What would the offspring look like?
/me sighs.
ThE ClOnNiNg MaChInE Is DeAd.
The offspring would look exactly like you.
10>mfw that fic with all the rainbow dashes
So it wouldn't result in a bunch of tiny cloning machines, I guess.
Multiple dashes?
10>the image of a new world. A beautiful world.
10Dashite: Multiple dashes.
>a world full of dash
the double rainbow dash fic, presumably
10^
12!Pokemon
Ah, haven't read it.
THIS IS RELEVANT TO MY INTERESTS
12!pokemon
10DE
12Awesome :D
10So many rainbow dashes
10SO many
DOUBLE RAINBOW DASH ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE SKY!OH MAH GOD!
So 1.20 to the power of what, to calculate this coolness?
Woah, connection fail
What did you want RBD?
10DE I just said 'So many rainbow dashes. SO many'
Woah
I have horrible connection
What about them?
/me pulls out the Spy's Ambassador and tries to shoot himself
I am still connected right?
Nope. You left a long time ago.
Har har har
Just a question. If I get a purple custom FiM T-shirt made, and I wear it to work, does that make me an attention horse?
Anyway, what is this about MULTIPLE RAINBOW DASH'S?
Cable companies are EVIL
And I just lost connection AGAIN
RobotPinkie,yes it does.
FUUUUUUUUU
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Thus why I prefer DirecTV :B
brb
*Runs*
Aw, why?
Good for you, we DON'T hhave Direct TV here
12Netflix always wins
And direct TCV sounds stupid
Ew netflix
We can't use that either :P
So Cable or GTFO locally .v.
Or Wireless/WoW
Now....it seems my connection is stable
;D
i'm back
12LOL, netflix is used through the internet XD
I work in a comic book store, btw. People regularly wear various animation and comic book themed shirts.
So...for like the third time...what were we talking about?
NS, netflix BLOCKS BDA lol
Like all other streaming companies :|
12Really? lol
(No iPlayer, Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Prime TV)
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/08/story-double-rainbow-directors-cut.html
So yeah
Duh
Presumably that.

oh god that fic
Additional Tags: Biologically impossible, democracy, babies everywhere
But really, what's the difference between some Naruto or Spider-Man shirt and FiM shirts?
oh, sorry, I forgot we're still mourning Spider-Man. :(

06PINGAS
06!ping

06:P
Not sure if is IS the bouncer
!pong
;o
*if it is
It does seem to make a lot of people very angry, though.
The fan fiction?
Or the shirts?
Well, referring to the shirts, though it's certainly true for both.
Why?
Why what?
FUCK DA SPYS!
/me jumps off the roof
Sappin mah sentry
" It does seem to make a lot of people very angry, though."
lol I really don't know why, but it's the reason I'm hesitant to wear an FiM shirt

Did he died?
Mmmm, dad's getting an iPhone 4 soon :3

/me bites the collar
*epic
12No getting away this time :3
/me is un-collar-able :3
Sorry, my computer just turned off and I had to reboot it.:(
I liked Scarlet Spider too.
Nah, we all ran away because we though VioletVanilla was getting ready to start a sequel to Pegacorn x Bjornfot with that last line.
You'd love it if it was Manly, though, Shiny
AAH!VIOLETVANILLA!GET OFF ME!
*Runs*
Oh, cool.
o^o
/me also puts micro chip in Shiny :3
;A; What'd I do wrong. . . ??

12That way, if he gets lost I can find him again :3
Bjornfot?
/me opens up a microsoft word document.
Quick, someone linke Pegacorn x Bjornfot for ViolentVanilla. :D
Well... uh... he's Bjornfot
/me title the document "Pegacorn x VioletVanilla"
Bjornfot is also the on in charge of the dating sim project (The non-cancelled one)
/me puts a Force-a-Nature up to his mouth.

Is it actually him?
Really?
I am pretty sure.
No. . .
It seems incredibly likely
wait really?
I pointed out the name last night and made Dari/RainBroDash go "My brain is full of fuck. It all makes so much sense."
He was the one that told Sethisto that the sim wasn't off.
10my brain is full of fuck
10so full of fuck
10OUR bjornfort
Well, Emil Björnfot is listed as the programmer for the project.
/me pulls the Force-a-Nature's trigger
So I guess so.

Cool, wonder if their project is finished before mine.

Huge birds they be
Yep. But the first one died when my cow ate all her feathers.
Those are some tiny ponies
Everything is made of ponies.
Gotta have lots of open space
I rode around on them.:)
Wait, so you're saying that by posting more ponies, we're actually helping the internet grow?
kB/s actually stands for killerBronies per second
Yes RobotPinkie, yes.
Not really. I also have a peacock.
Awesome.
Wow... What a weird way to die. 0__o
I got nothin'.
He likes to eat catfood.
Pretty feathers
@Pegacorn I've got a midnight snack. ;D

That's showing this week, right?
xP me neither haha
Yes
Eyup
i remember the cartoon of killer tomatoes
NewDCD i'm sure you're aware, but stream isn't on psp
Ah there we go :3
"I'm not a mad scientist, just an ANGRY scientist!"
is that gurren lagann?
Dermathil nope
lol
9I know. It takes a bit of time to adjust it
I'm sad though. I'm going to have to miss the beginning of the stream. I have a doctor's appointment at 4pm PST on Friday.
ah
'Cause it looks WAY better and is closer to my expectations.
Dermathil , NewDCD says there's a character here who actually compares to Kamina
owait
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH TOO ANIMATED!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That's seed
Gundam
and dermathil google gurren lagann - it's anime style, but fukken awesome animashun
/me 9resists the desire to slap your shit. Gurren Lagann was great, but it wasn't the greatest mech series in history.
>mfw I never watched any mech series before
NewDCD i'm an anime noob - bear this in mind. Now - Teach me!
9I meant Dman. NOW LOOK AT THE OTHER ROBOTS TEACH HIM HOW IT'S DONE.
>yfw I hated Evangelion
Are the transformers cartoons the greatest mech series in history?
I thought Code Geass was completely ridiculous.
My internet dun derped.Now i'm back.
>trollestiaface.jpg
FFUUUUU
9Evangelion is overrated, Gurren Lagann was a hilarous trainwreck but awesome to watch, ect.
well Geass sucks
I have a Killer Tomatoes poster hanging up in this very room.
It was just the first thing I thought of for some reason
9I like Geass, but like how we like DeathStalker and Battlefield Earth
I want to request a really weird cartoon for us to watch.
why arent we watching gundam seed or gundam zero?
I've seen like 10 animes only, but maria holic was teh lulz
>yfw I enjoyed Brain Powered
9>Gundam Seed
Let's watch Return to the Planet of the Apes.
9GET
9OUT
I like Geass, but only because of how overly theatrical everything is.
tacowiz oh you
lol who should get out?
9Brain Powered was great
As an actual show, no
I liked Eva and Gundam Wing, Gundam 00 took too long to do anything interesting
Hey D_man,are you gonna gift me L4D2 or not?
9Gundam Seed? more like Gundam SHIT. and Gundam SHIT DENSITY.
Pegacorn - rah't nao?
I didn't really watch any of the gundam shows.
I can't till at least tomorrow pega
9...Shinn was actually a good protagonist, though.
gotta put money on my card if you want L4D2
I liked Gundam Wing, though, is that heresy?
9TOO BAD KIRA IS TOO MUCH OF A MARY SUE
9eh, Gundam Wing was lackluster
9but it's not terrible
02*WB03(Kosoveon03)02WB* - <Kosovo> Don't make me Octopus you. >:/
9it was...just bland
Wait, is this still the intro to a game?
If so...
Wow.
Long intro.

Noice

True
FiM is manly

I'm still not sure if my computer can handle the TF2 I downloaded a couple days ago.
12back
robotpinkie - i did actually go watery eyed and goosebumpy
What does it do, sell stamps? :P
03yes
03it lets you print stamps using your printer
03it's useful if you're sending things that are bigger than an envelope
03like packages
lol me too, told you I'm manly :P
I liked that part
03becaues it gives you business pricing, which is cheaper than consumer pricing
Don't you need to pay for it though
Aha
Nice
03I didn't tell them that I'm not a business, but I dont'care :)
03Yeah, you pay loike $16 a month

9I love FE too
Ahhh
a surfing mecha? really?
9but SRW is obviously my favorite
9>he does not know Eureka 7
03I know right
since they started using unity instead of gnome as the desktop environment
039.04 is the last good ubuntu, IMHO
03which i still use
I like 10.04
Shining Force > Fire Emblem
u mad?
03I don't
03>OSX
LOL
well
9not really
9I never COULD get into SF though
I prefer that one the most
and 10.04 uses gnome not unity
I request you play some more Cthulhu
i odn't know eureka 7
11.04 is the one that starts using unity I think
either that or 10.10

>mfw HP NUMBERS
aww man! newdcd: where's my lyrics! newdcd: pronounsiation is meh
just be glad they have voiceovers
9part of the reason people love SRW is to hear the new instrumental music of the songs
'giga DURILU BREAKA' in anime he says 'giga ... durilu ... BREAKA' ('Durilu' doesn't have epic emphasis giving 'breaka' more so)

No Giant Robo? :O
...p'haps i should watch more mecha
lol

9The last time we had Giant Robot included in SRW was in Alpha 1
There is no Dana! There is only ZUURU!

9bonus points that unlock hard difficulty
9and other goodies
:P i see
9that said
9I remember my friend spoiled me
9because this game is split in...well, two games
nadie save lo que he puesto \o/ muahaha
9the second hasn't been released yet
9but at the end of this one, they show a preview for the next
two games?
so thisis recent?
9apparently Adult!Simon starts calling Ryoma "Aniki"
9yeah
9this years
wait, what's the second part of Z2? Z3? Z2b?
9*year's
Won't it be fun to have always on DRM when using Dial up
9Z2-2
Or is this teh QQ about the jewcreators who won't make 2nd game?
9This is "Break The World" Chapter
9no
9it's because the game is massive
9this here is 52+ scenarios
9plus route splits
9that means this game's story has at least 100 scenarios
de magicks
9or stages if you may
soMuchContent.jpg
somuchwin.gif
104 actually, if each scenario has a route split
NewDCD out of very large curiosity - do you play with your computer screen or your PSP screen?
9PSP screen
9there is no PSP emulator
Thanks
9but if you mean what I look at
9then both
There is a video feed
Oh both? lol
9PSP screen is transferred to the screen
And i know about PSP haxxing bro, just wondering what screen you used. both eh? :P
9but still appears on my PSP
I know man :P
THE LAG
9so I sometimes switch my glances if my neck gets tired or something
Okie
so much lag
9it's really lagging?
NewDCD does this game have a localised version?
you should totally stream dissidia if you have it, the noises they make are hillarious :P
ValtheJean i love that game :P
9...oh, this is the stage you fight the Final Boss before the end
9...that explains everything
@D_man Greatest...attack....EVERRRRR!

<3
Hi, I'm back.
12Welcome back
JA KLAR!
GUT!
My mom just got back from the ER. Don't worry, she just had a really bad stomachache.
@NewDCD This dude should learn to shoot just to the right of his enemies
lol
Or something like that...
wait a minute
12Hope she feels better soon :<
these comics aren't german!
;(
oh they're translated
damn, that attacks did absolutely no damage
still ;(
never seen you around here before
and sorry to hear that about your mom :/
how will it hold up against gurren lagann?
STRIKE HIS WEAKPOINT FOR MAXIMUM DAMAGE
03oh woah
And you ... attack it's weakpoint .... for massive damage
03Family Feud has the celebrities
SURROUND THAT BASTARD!!!
9SRW TACTICS DON'T WORK THAT WAY
Which ones?
BELLY BUTTON BEAM
03lots of them
DAMN must'a done some damage
..........wat
this guy's a demigod or something
9I'm not wasting the Spirit Command I have casted on GL for a lackluster attack. Gonna wait for Kamina and Simon's will to increase a bit
Yay~
: 3
Oh, you know how I was talking about that weird Lugia?
Oh, you know how I was talking about that weird Lugia?
12You repeated yourself :|
9let's due a damage check....Wall Seishin activated
12How so? lol
NewDCD - i only recognise like 2 or 3 of those mechas but I imagine the feel of having a team of all those heroes at your command is uncomparable!
9(Wall's Effect: all attacks on this unit do 1/4th of the damage during the present turn)
9pretty much
: D
03oh wait
03Celebrity look-alikes
NOOOOOOOOO
12What, am I that weird Lugia? :/
9>1400 damage on a fully-armored upgraded unit
......
03not the actual people
03:(
12Poofing now
chiort
9>taking 1/4th of the damage
9...the actual damage would be around 5000....
9...and Dai-Guard has full armor upgrades....
chyort
actually, DCD, that would be 5600dmg
12night everyone ~
12Aw, good night Lati :3
night lati
13Goodnight Latté :P
12Night :3
9...yeah, if I don't defend against his attacks, he can oneshot most of my units for sure
who is the boss btw?
new for game?
9it's just a rough estimate
9yeah, a Banpresto Original
w00t
best when they use original enemies
then it makes sence they can take em all on
i just realised i've done not much else but watch you play this for the past few hours
and it's 4am here :P
9.....that's a high as fuck hit rate. Better try and defend
13I just had a laughing fit over Peas
its the way to be
OH SHEEET
9and Crow has GREAT evasion
dat hit %
13Pea 638, to be exact .w.
uh oh
03LOL @ Family Feud
13I had to scroll down and get it off my screen to stop laughing
9also those three commands I can select down there
03"What keep ssomeone looking young?" "Sex"
9are Attack/Defend/Dodge
oh i see
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/361.jpg
9Attack lets you choose the attack you will retaliate with btw
is defend like guarranteed less damage but dodge a chance of complete miss or hit?
LOLperverts
9D_man: Dodge cuts a hit percentage by about half if it's not so high
9but in this case it would probably lower it tilll
oh ok
9.....66% hit chance or so
9....hmm
9I noticed something
: /
9this enemy probably has EN Regen
12Can you send them my way Espy? :3
9but I'm wearing down his EN count
that's nice~ that's good
oh he mad
OH FFF
OH SNAP
uh oh
9well, I guess he left.
hey there Dermathil :3
12Oh, wait never mind. You already said what pea it is |D
OH CARP
who just left?
one of your party?
oh the boss
HE JUST PULLED FAST ON ON YA
9boss
9but that's okay
Sorry, the dumb computer shut off.
9it's better that way
9now these mooks are a bit more proficient...let's go.
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/326.jpg
Thanks.
let's go let's go mecha time
9>yes, he has 18.5k and is considered a mook
Epic Dodge!
so newdcd r u gonna keep gurren lagann charging willpower then?
7Shut off, eh?
7Overheating?
9SCOOTALOO ARE YOU SURE YOU NEEDED MY SISTER'S DRILL
As I was saying...I saw a Lugia with hazel eyes and a really bad storm starts. Coincedence? I don't think so.
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/353.jpg
9at least till he's at 110 so I can use some better attacks
7Don't think so.
denied_existence, that website is wonderful an'all, but right now we're kickin' ass, so post some win pics ; )
7Everyone here's a Lugia. :P
7So expect repeats.
yay~
9Chill the fuck out, Dai-Guard can take that attack head on
does this have lagann impact?
03oh
03people need to be more original.
9SUPPORT ATTACK
9yeah, but why would I separa-good idea.
oh oh what's lagann's most powerful attack? is ther esome sort of combination attack in this game?
like combining mechas?
to make a godmecha?
Oh, I'm writing a story about two Shadow Lugias. One's good and the other is evil Good one's Shadow.
9keep in mind this game covers the first half of GL
inb4 sequel bossending
yea yea
9as in, till they deal with Lord Genome
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/rd-salute-flag/usa.jpg

03kthx
lol
It's the greatest attack ever
:)
/me builds a mechanized suit out of Tungusken
Laguna said so :P
:)
/me is placing pylons
9look in youtube for "Asakim All Attacks" if you want to spoil yourself
tiny mecha
7Lol.
I think we all know the truth behind this scandal ;)
7What, you think I intend to be? O_o
03I know right
/me wires together the mechanized suit.
/me is on youtube
03you've shown signs of it :P
7Lol, you know our current situation in the fora.
super robot wars z
9it's part of a bigger robot
looks good
03fora? o.o
Flora!
7Alternate plural of forum.
/me adds a MAG cannon to his mechanical suit.
so yea newdcd in z2-2 there shud be a hugeass mecha with all in
12Also, you're not a mod either drf :p
03temporarily.
/me installs a Type-XIV nuclear reactor in his Mechanized Suit.
fact remains that he is supposed to be one :p
Also why does the guy be shown all dodgy / shifty like with shadow over half of head? in z1 he's blueblack hair so y here not?
/me is placing pylons
/me is placing pylons
9>Nuclear Reaction
03^
9*Reactor
/me is placing pylons
Yes, nuclear reactor.
9>not using an Hydrogen-
9*Hydrogen-3 Reactor or Fullcanelli-Type Eternal Engine in your mech
Who said I was using FISSION?
12If you would stop being so opinionated drf
9>not using Getter Rays
/me upgrades his reactor to an antimatter engine.
oh god here we go with the not usings :P
lol
9OH SHIT HERE WE GO
/me is placing pylons
WHAT NOW?
7I think we scared away Shadow. :<
9DISCALIBUR
place more pylons?
7Or it's his connection (assuming it's a he).
/me is placing pylons
There's nothing wrong with being opinionated, but also, I agree with Quan, but you didn't need to say "Eh, let me handle it." :p
Newdcd why does the guy be shown all dodgy / shifty like with shadow over half of head? in z1 he's blueblack hair so y here not?
12It's a she I think
Sounds like a she
Sound like a me
sounds*
Remember me?
what are you watching?
03also what situation on the forums?
9it's because they're obscuring his (very obvious) identity due to plot reasons
/me wonders why FlutterHi is placing so many pylons...
What about me
it isn't fair
o...k...?
blah blah blah
but people who have played z1 will know easily! the mecha!
7The stuff about TST's social lethargy.
03LOL
what plot reasons?
/me sneezes
9dude it's obvious, but who cares
ok
Damn enemies with stupid plot shields
9he's probably that "shady" to the player team
/me is placing pylons
I make a lot of those
specify the right one :D
I guess so
12rofl
okay
I know what you mean
but wait...who was in z1 then?
anyway
I'm back.
it's true :p
and wb Shadow
9ZEUTH
all the original mechas?
7WB, Shadow.
9this is ZEXIS
thanks.
9an alternate world
7o.O
hurp
7Lol, NS.
I decided to RP but I have limited mental capacity right now soo
9this is the event were worlds start merging and shit
/me is placing pylons
ohlol so z2 is alternate world?
What?
I couldn't resist
will z3 be another?
7How intentional. XD
oh god it feels so weird to use this ;_;
FABULOOOOOOUS beam
/me eats habanero
7Hmm...
9SRW as a whole runs on a parallel world continuity, hinted by certain characters
6Why not. :P
It makes me think back to my "noob days"
12D:
/me loads a tactical cruise missile launcher onto his mechanized suit.
haha
finished the prologue. it's too long to put it on here, so I won't
so every mecha's plot folds into one hugeass plot?
prologue?
9for example, Gillian Yaeger has experienced events from Original Continuity/Alpha Series and the OG series
6Forums, Shadow?
the advertisment on the top of my screen says "CLICK TO LEARN HOW TO MAKE ELECTRICITY!"
12:)
the fuck
9not really, in SRW games
03no but, really, what thing on the forums
9most of the time
/me attaches 3 tri-barreled gatling guns to his mechanized suit.
9they all occur in the same worl
9*world
What is this game? o: I just got here. . .
the topic I made, drf
6Hello, Shadow.
so then...to Simon and kamina they think the others are in more gunmen?
6XD
the bawwing one
12:)
oshi
6This amuses me. :>
9no no, no world traveling till now
03WHAT THE FRICK @ Family Feud
9as in
:)
03"Top 5 reasons why having sex in a bathtub isn't romantic"
9these all belonged in different parts of the globe
9but in the same world
lolwut
03that's the question, I kid you not
LOLwhat
9for example
Ooohhh
9if I were to make Super /co/ Wars
I was playing solitaire
9we could say that Adventure Time's land is on the other side of the EverFree Forest
6<insert meme here>
so each 'anime' is set in another part of the same planet?
/me 6flees.
9and the Fire Nation is north of that
9and so on
):
9yeah...at least till this game, which merges with the world of Z1
12This is a PG13 channel drf :p
I need to get back to my story...so I won't reply for a little bit.
9but that's happening right now
