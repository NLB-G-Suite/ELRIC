11I gotta say, American Television wouldn't DARE be this contreversial
also Torrenting Godzilla The Animated Series from 1999

07mmk
11controversial*
wait, this is controversial nowadays?
but yeah
angel
:D
Gay scenes on TV isn't really controversial here any more.
11Prince-Dari: We're too politically correct over here. *rolls eyes*
6that's actually....next week o.o
I just made mini fanfic.
07hurr
11congrats, Nittany.
6I'M OK WITH THIS
11We don't even have Lesbian television over here. >.>

Wow.
6go post in initiation
6we've been waiting for you
Series 1 finale.
11Yeah, people in this country are too freaking uptight about sexuality.
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
6yes?
6I have an answer
6maybe
02Have you ever seen Summer Wars?
I mean I know the right wing christians aren't keen on homosexuality.
12no
6no
02Hmm, all right.
But most people support gay marriage, I thought
07hurr
07but ok I guess
This is the series finale now guys.
Be ready for the awesome. :D
Here I am again.
I'm watching!
IT'S A TRAP!
They couldn't resist putting that in once more.
11The problem is that the people in power are either right-wing, bible thumping christians, or are afraid of losing their position by showing support for the Gay community.
ITS A TRAP!?
07er
07o3o;
I've heard of it
We're a lot looser about it like the UK, but very few TV shows can be proud to say 100% Canadian
02Yeah?
but I never got around to seeing it
Which sucks
is it any good?
I want boobies all times of day without having to PPV
Dat nudity
...
02Yes, it's really good.
6gonna be migrating houses again soon
wat
Honestly, I see greed as a larger problem in this country than religious conservatism. In either way, people don't want to change.
/me should see it, then
11Walking nude around the house. Like a boss.
It's the rapture!
11Prince-Dari: Is it going on in october?
02Yes!
11lol, Dari
11A bible-thumper was going around saying the world would end May 22nd or sometime around then.
That dude that calculated the rapture was wrong.
11When May came and went, he said that was the "silent judgement" and the real demise would be in October.
And another embarrassment to my belief.
11I don't mind any religion, as long as it's not getting shoved in my face.
I don't shove my religion (belief) in people's faces.
@Denied_Existence HEELLLLLSSS YEAHHHH
11Especially when it comes to political issues where religion doesn't belong.
=]
~yay~
lol
Kind of like something else...
brb going downsatairs
I think that religion is usually a good thing and that the intention behind it is good, though I'm not religious myself.
11Agreed, Dari.
It's the extremists that give religion a bad name.
It's sad that my religion is on the chopping block. Now I know how muslims feel.

People say cartoons in the 90s were awesome
I tend to agree, but whenever my mind wanders to Looney Tunes
As a child, I always wondered how Bugs would get that barber seat down from that height
he'd have to climb that pole all the way up again
WET PAINT
Makes sense
Shh, be vewy vewy quiet
He'd like that
I'm hunting Gwiffons!
huhuhuhuhuhuhuhuh
Fun fact: Apparently the reason Bugs dresses up in women's clothes is based on the fact that the animators, when they lost bets, ahd to dress up in womens' clsothes for the day

10i have been good
11Okay! :)
11Yeah, me too!
11It's just too bad many people are refusing to try it out
10well the wii and 3ds might not be the same as the rest
10yea
11That's right
10hiya
10I don't think I'll be at that meeting today
10Just letting you know
11Yes, but they'd rather whine at the trailers than check out the walkthroughs
Heh well, I think it was yesterday and it didn't even happen
10ohlol
10I kept thinking it was a Thursday for some reason
6:O
6It comes out in November,right?
10oh i'm on my laptop

10getting a thought going to go watch some videos today and you?
6brb
11Nope. Not a single plot... yet!
10yea
11Maybe some of the stories should focus on other characters as well as Spyro.
10yea
10maybe a split story
11Yeah.
11Good one
10so tht way we can get more stories
11We should also do one for a few world-baised stories, such as Skelos Badlands
10Yea
10So where should we put these after we are done on DA?
/me waves back.
11I don't know
I haven't drawn anything more, by the way

I was about to ask!
>herdmind for the xth time
all day erry day son. but yea, I'm sorry i haven't drawn any more yet
11Okay, but not at Spyropedia. We would start our own topic for stories at our wiki once it's editable again

10is DS is a 3ds only character i need to get the 3ds and play him on the 360
10like $700 just for spyro
11The characters can be used for all versions
10and $800 for everything mw3 spyro and halo
11Who knows
11I've already lost patiance
10http://kotaku.com/halo/ XD
10i'm not sure
11That's that?
11I think that by time they are finished, SSA would have already been released
6 800$? Wtf ? o.o
10yea
10yes
6Why?
10C7 watch the vid
10well
11$800?
10maybe around 500$
10well if the figures are 7$ each
6xD
/me catches
6:O 99?
11$7 in America
6Is that offically how many there are?
11But in Australia, the price is normally higher, like around $12
10yes
11Maybe
11I can get all figs, unless it's more than $20 per fig
/me 10wants akilljoy like mc
11How many I'll get depends on the game's exitment
6Can you give me two three-digit numbers?

10$231.71
10thats for toys
11Yep
06:3
6Meh.. .-.
: /
6I'll probably have to wait 5 years till the price goes down enough..
how far in is it? (i mentioned it in the channel, but i've never played D&D, yet i've seen about 10 games before)
Still in character creation.
I'm the only real veteran player.
11Maybe, but the hatedom might put it to $5 (per figure) by this time next year
yeah
10then it would be $171.73
haha same just now
11Okay
10which comes to about 250$
(I think that LPer is a brony)
(he also liked the fluttercussing vid)
http://www.youtube.com/user/PaperBatVG#p/a/u/2/kFRGWo32aJg
11Just be very thankful you did not become over-addicted to one pre-made family like I did

6Meh..I usually tend to get kinda addicted..

I think it's hillarious
Word
Adjective

03iiiiiiiiiiii
well
I'm trying to make a theme for Sathi
but the damn template wont let me adjust images and whatnot
it just loops them like a complete retard
: /
the problem: is that if you use a different resolution, or have a larger monitor than me, it fails miserably
raaarwwrwrgfgjlkdsgpfogl;
yeah
: /
10maybe
10i don't know
10it seems we are working ourselves done
that was weird...
11We might
10*Down
11At least TTE is still active at Bulbapedia, sometimes
not me
it happens sometimes to somepeople
happened to me before
weird
:P
agreed
10yea
11Maybe we should only contact him when we need an admin's help.
11Currently, we need to create pages and gather images ready for SSA
10yes but a lot of it is locked for admins only
11Some templates are not needed to be edited yet
11The one for the worlds does, as it's not been updated for Spyro: A Hero's Tail
alright back
10the villains
Yes
now stop distracting me
10we need to add hektore

11But how can we reach TTE? I don't want to create an account on Bulbapedia
10idk
10i'm not sure

06o.o
/me refreshes his emailbox for the first time of the day.
The best fanfic ever being written
/me chokes on his pepsi
35chapters and counting!
It's quality, not quantity! 13 chapters and counting
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/07/story-past-sins.html
Wait, how long are the chapter then, eh?
11Do you like Simpsons?
and it currently is the most popular post in the EqD sidebar.
No other fic is in there.
11Just wondering, as I found some episodes online
Check two posts down
derp
lol
herpyderpderp
I just noticed something in the season 2 screenies post: the 2nd picture has, on the right monitor, the very same post on EqD (recogniseable due to the 1st picture being seen in that screen)
That thread is a ponyception in Apocalyptic sizes
Yea, in the twitter post they said "Us looking at us"
lol
06and THIS:
06http://www.speedtest.net/result/1417319545.png
13Reminds me of my connection speed
O_o
06router and modem need a reset
yeah
me gusta....
Yep, its over at #ponies&dragons
06BBL, resetting bthat darn thing >.>
06.-.
the 3.5
wewt
that's the best one
06how is that connection in the top 7% o.o
(I also discovered yesterday that I got a slew of AD&D books)
you also a vet player?
yeah
10>has never played DnD >.>
DM'd a few times
nice.
10I know, I've seen it happen
I think my favorite character I made:
Also, we all be lvl 1
but, he had really high Dexterity and Charisma
were nerds
Dubtrotmaster got it right.
BECAUSE IT'S FUCKING AWESOME
depends
it depends on how you WANT to play it
10WANT
How do you have fights...
lol, well I could go into the entire details of initiative and whatnot, but it's just turn based combat
It's different, that's automated, preset story and everything.
This is people making up a story and acting it out through text.
not that I know of.
basically
it's dnd, but with vampires
he had simplified it alot, but even then we were stuck for a whole IRL day.
(Vampire Masquerade: Bloodlines)
rings a bell then.
it's REALLY memorable
because there's a lot less emphasis on die-rolls and pure stats
the abilities are much more generalized and open for interpretation
lol

9Evangelion is overrated, Gurren Lagann was a hilarous trainwreck but awesome to watch, ect.
It was just the first thing I thought of for some reason
I want to request a really weird cartoon for us to watch.
why arent we watching gundam seed or gundam zero?
>yfw I enjoyed Brain Powered
9>Gundam Seed
Let's watch Return to the Planet of the Apes.
9GET

9Brain Powered was great
As an actual show, no
I liked Eva and Gundam Wing, Gundam 00 took too long to do anything interesting
Hey D_man,are you gonna gift me L4D2 or not?
9Gundam Seed? more like Gundam SHIT. and Gundam SHIT DENSITY.
I didn't really watch any of the gundam shows.
I can't till at least tomorrow pega
9...Shinn was actually a good protagonist, though.
gotta put money on my card if you want L4D2
I liked Gundam Wing, though, is that heresy?
