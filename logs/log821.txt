BroPony|ENGI: sorry, got used to correcting myself, now it's gone to correcting other people now

BroPony|ENGI: buy persona 3 on the PSN , only 5 bucks

legendary_brony: you havnt seen HRNG yet
Nah, AJ is where it's at :3

Bronysith: nah, i think there's more twilight fans, she usually has a bit of an advantage on polls
so your insulting 90% of bronies
How about something for Twilight fans?

As long as there's no hating on a pony from the Mane 6, I'm fine with it.
DerpyMuffins: i'll linky if i find anything good
*head exploted*
BroPony|ENGI: can i have more apple frwitters?
im just going through the last drawfriend
Twilight is the main character, though. :c
i ma going to draw my thing
There should be more polls that are, "Who is the best pony EXCEPT Twilight Sparkle?"
And some idiot manages to find a way to add Twilight Sparkle onto the choices.
/me falls asleep
Spell-of-Gaming: because she is always best pony, even when ineligible :D
Twilight is most likely going to get most tropes
i dont have a favorite pony
i love them all
equally
Is there a trope where "the main character is loved by most of the fandom"

o/`` racist barn raceist barn 1 2 3 4 o/``
1234
6What do u guys want to talk about?
13in the absence of anything to contribute, bronies parrot the misheard lyrics of the previous episode
sai waaaaat?
eeeyup
it totaly sound like racist barn though :D
13no it didn't, it sounded like "raise this barn"
^
well maybe to you Shizuka
13but our culture has degraded so much that people need to find inappropriate references in absolutely everything
mhmm
>.>
<.<
>_>
And here was me thinking it came from a pony thread sim fad
waht!
time to bring out the random topic generator
lol wat
and we are not all staring at the chat constantly, we are doing other stuff.
Meh. I wouldnn't take it that way. I doubt anyone even really knows what a racist barn is or what it means.
you say what as a statement, not a question so I'm not sure how to interpret
saying: What. is common though
When I looked it up, some one compared a "racist barn" to an atypical barn. Kind of like WW2 propaganda against hitler, or the japanese.
wat is a statement. a statement of i don't even
yes, that
Shizuka: Of course, this assumes that this culture ever had a height to degrade from...
Vivix: Yes but usually followed by a question mark to show it as a question
but it's not a questin in that case
I know
usually it's emphasized by a punctuation rather than a question mark-
I know
Then it is not usually followed by a questionmark
6What do u guys think about ducks?
as far raise this barn, I think it's too awkward to try to make it sound like racist barn because of the last syllable
IM. SO. BORED.
I was just saying I did not know which way I should have interpreted the statement. Should I have expected a description of this what or just seen it as a statement of bamboozelment
SuperBrony64
ducks are awesome
songs*
I'm not whining
not you, silly
Oops
/me strokes
I'm too caught up in this post talk
post talk?
*posh
aah
hey Neo
now everything sounds like Rarity in my head
Here is the comment I was talking about earlier, with link. "To me, the barn appears to have similar qualities to old, racist war propaganda. Here's an example: www.deutsche-schutzgebiete.de/webpages/Kriegs propagandaka... This is in no way to imply that I'm racist (I'm far from it), it simply caught my attention." sorry for the test wall.
Great I ruin it with dreadfull spelling just as I approached the end of my dramatisation

Hey guys
Ohai Ponies47
hiya
Hey Ponies47
how you doin?
Hi
Ohai Ponies47 ^-^
Hi Ponies47 :)
That comment is a great example though, in comparison to the song lyrics being the way they are. It was simply a matter of perspective, meant to be humorous. I wouldn't think on it to much.
myes, I can't hear it, but it doesn't bother me
I hear it only becuase it makes me laugh.
k question why doesn't Spyro beat up the pirates who capture him?
wheres SuperBrony64
GOD DAM IT MISSED HIM AAGIN
no clue
he should of falcon punched them
and ran away
because it was convenient for the plot that he didn't
He was never here.
still
stupid
in other words, lazy writing :P
oh great
lazy writing
hence why moleyair got caught
Ever
why not exhumor?
He is most likely serching pictures of funny cats on the internet listening to the sound of frollicking cows
*frollocking
he wasn't caught
I actually don't remember much about that game
so I can't help you there
:P
also why pirates?
*searching
>.>
they dont serve a purpose
so they could do a flying pirate ship level? Dunno
ugh krome studios
yeah they do
ur lazy
what purpose afflict?
other than they're the same enemies
wurds*
as the apes
*potato
:O
!!
JUST CAUSE 2
Its like my cat nip.
Who's streaming?
If you mean why they used pirates instead of apes, I don't know then
HOOKSHOT THE GAME
yeah
thats what i mean
Shizu?
Awesome people
Also Shizuka
Oh, yaaay! ^-^
oh
I have never used this games benchmark
Oh wait. Yeah I have.
The hd quality :O
Maybe they used them so they could have that level with all the floating ships?
yeah
also blundertails arent hard
Don't know if it was significant to the story though
as every1 thinks
they're easy
compared to executioner
and ravage rider
Woooo shit is blowing up!
Splosions: The Game
BarbetosMyBananas: there's a hole in your link
also something funny when spyro faints how does he end up in a diff location than where he started?
BarbetosMyBananas: it's also 404
Damnit why did I have to remember that dreadfull game
Spyro isn't meant to be realistic, it's meant to be fun :P
still
i question that
dreadful? that's not how you spell fun
its like oops fainted
oh hey diff place
It's probably in his head or something
i love when he faints
"He does nawt sound much liek a peeble pursawn."
its like X.X
How is 'the game' fun... except when you make others lose
Darn
btw you all just lost
lol
are we both talking about just casuse 2?
no
derp oops
i fainted
cheeeessssseeee
pot80: sorry to tell you this, but you're stuck in the wrong century
I love this game
Ammo running out already after few shots
Its a true secret agent game
Dark_Horst You're telling me you don't know what the game is?
pot80: dont be silly
Oh thank Jesus
pot80: i meanw hat i said
for those who have played legend of spyro whats u guys fav element?
I did not appreciate Sparx's sarcastic comments when you die in those games
...
"hey, try not to die again?"
oh yeah
Yeah Sparx, I will, thanks
i was like stfu sparx
"Why not try shooting some magic out of your face"
6Fire
that was the worst one
Ugh, I remember that one
XD
6DX
Fire good element
I wish I had the computer power to run this game.
that one I kind of appreciated though
Because it was true
mine is earth
it doesnt take much
6Alot happened when i was gone
he just spits "earth" or whatever
afternoon everyone
That tells you alot about my computer.
and it doesn't really make any sense
I got a choice between an ancienc computer and a mac so I'm stuffed
lol
Afternoon.
nor does ice
6I love the fire element best
Yup.
But really, Sparx was way better without a voice :P
brb, dinner time
Oh crap its half elleven already! Last I checked it was nine
also how come in new beginning the furies do less
6I remember playing Dotd and Ignitus i died and i cryed forever and im not accepting he died
HAWYS GUYS WHO STREAM?
that's not an unlimited ammo cheat i'm seeing, is it?
like less damage
Ohai Rustymeat, it is shizu :)
^^
6it was so sad seing that in Dotd and i agree on that
Oh neat
I actually got scared when Spyro flipped out when Ignitus died
Anyhow I'm gonna make like a tree and get outta here now. Bye!
definitely wasn't expecting that

when did bronystate get commercials/ads in the middle of the video
Buytoast: does he punch boulders?
Lyra_Heartstrings, it's the streaming service
Lyra_Heartstrings, just get adblock :P
probably
maybe
Buytoast: this game is pre 2010
we will never know
Nope
6whys that?
they would've stated it in the games
this is the 2010 game of the year
Dark_Horst: this game was 2010
And that would be way to cliche
Even for that series
huh. feels longer
Get up like nothing happened
goddamn is this guy invincible?
Cluster bomb launcher...
yeah I doubt it
6They probely would of made it in the game after Dotd if Activision didnt ruin spyro
DotD was the end of the LoS series
Buytoast: hes the offspring of zeus and an acrobat
How could they have even made another?
The Grenade Launcher looke liked the Husk Gun from killing floor for a moment
Buytoast: well trianer. software

/me explodes
Buytoast: traienrs are software that enhances a game. aka godmode, bottomless magazines and unlocks
im watching on a windows 7, but its a laptop
My username is relevant.
When you save the world from itself, you need something from OUTSIDE the world to make a sequel
6Then it was canceed when Activision took spyro and ruined him
http://memeimages.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ancient-aliens-guy-big-hair-giorgio-tsoukalos.jpeg
Wasn't Spyro's Kingdom renemed to Skylanders?
No
So probably aliens or some alternate dimension dragon people
well, yes to Afflict :P
Real friends don't get ffended when you insult them. They only smile and think of something worse to offend you
Spyro's Kingdom was the working title for Skylanders
ah ok
before it was developed into what it is now
/me noms on AdamTheDuck's Remains >:P3

It snowed here briefly. Not too much though.

LadyCanary: were having a blizzard
Lyra_Headstrings, you are on a lot of chats
Lyra_Heartstrings: Bahaha

And then it repeats
No.
Mike|Explosives: With your attitide, no one does :I

The fact that you would even ACCUSE or SAY such a thing.

Along with fun and horses.
Logic can be allowed.
You'd figure people would learn by now.
Physics!

Hey baconmane
Srs bsns, no fun allowed
But logic hurts the others.
that engine does not sound good
Buytoast, Ew fun and horses
hows it going
Sharing is equal to or greater than caring, Elsie.
NO FUN HERE :|
@BaconMane Yes?
what in the hell is that sound

magic missile! magic missile! magic missile! magic missil!
did that truck just vanish
Got some nice gifts, went up to Vermont to visit my mom.
I gotta leave
Bye
Mike|Explosives: They would say: "What the fuck am I doing, I'm a technicolor horse. I should do horse things.
See you folks tomorrow
"
Although he also got the gift of surviving said heart attack.
/me patpats DocSane
String_Shredder: I meant the pony pun in 'HEAT, LVL1'
Terry Crews says OH NO
a horse would get nothing if it tried to interact with this game
flop
fail
a horse cannot play the game
00,10So it's sorta like gta, but they made the rampages fun
Yea
Mike|Explosives: What pony pun?
Ewwww, unnaturally colourful adolescent equine
so gaaaaay >_>
^
Buytoast: Not talking horses. Talking magical talking ponies.
no such thing
only horses
YUSH! I found a working computer!
Hai all
AdamTheDuck: Isnt Horse47 one?
AdamTheDUck: *gheeeey
all aboard the Shizubego
Hai
basically what would have happened if micheal bay had been in charge of gta
how do you do the apple jack emotocon?
String_Shredder: Ponies and horses have heat cycles as oppsed to menstruation in their process of procreation.
>_> <_<
I don't know AssertiveFluttershy1 >_> <_<
Pretty much
the yellow cars would all turn into bumblebee
00,10can it fly?
Mike|Explosives: Because everybody gets that.
No, but it can kill things
I meant the shortcut
:P
Sumica, does attaching a string to the bus and shooting it across the map count as flying?
that was a terrible attempt at humor Mike
i'd suggest you stop and never try again
Listen to the Toast
00,10no but I want to see that any ways
String_Shredder: Well, as a brony, I expect sme peple to get my joke.
he's right

Panda: Shizu.
Goodnight Havok :)
Thought so.
GilDash: it's supposed to be terrible

00,10wait Panda
00,10it might go on sell
WHAT!
That was planned, surely? XD
00,10it's on the quick vote
this game doesnt support XP, which pisses me off
Sailing into city on a airplane... someone's a badass.
How did you.... how.... does this game run with Pinkie physics?
Then taking a car
and crashing it
00,10I think I would have teathered the plane to a building
Rubber wall?
Panda: Oh, you should see the propane gas/grapple hook combo.
And it bounces off like rubber
BerryPunch, now stay connected :<
crash>parachute>steal car... interesting combo.
BerryPunch, also we still need to get your flags changed
BOOM
00,10it's like GTA bit with fun rampages
Evening Bronystate

hello
Hi Conyst :
:)*
Evenin' Conyst
Ah Josh Cause 2
Ok, what is the backstory for this.
00,10so my guess is shizu is gonna blow up every gas station but one
Panda, they stole our bananas
^
00,10and she will steal the one
Panda, we're fighting for our right to eat bananas
That was tiny.
So...... this guy is.... Bionic Commando?
How dare they steal our Bananas
00,10nope, jump good
Why walk when you can grapple hook everything?
AdamTheDuck: You gotta fight, for your right, too banaaaaaaana o3
Panda: international agent with a tendency to boom
Never get into a heli with Shizu
Panda: Bond-ish Commando. James Bond-ish Commando
They can take our dosh, but they will never take our bananas! :[
00,10hey Shizuka ghost ride this one =p
O_o
Yeah. Surf the heli. XD
cool
hey
BTW; THE ROPE ISNT USUALLY THAT LONG
Though his real name is Rico and he likes to blow up things
That was an old lady.
whoops
sorry
Nailed it!
Like a fuckin boss.
Luckiest guy in the world
looks like i looked away from screen in precisely the wrong moment
AdamTheDuck: wait, THey stole our Banana?! :O *me picks up the chancla* >:I
What? Is there a springboard under that car or something? XD
thelonecubone: :D
XDDDD
Shizuka, really?
Dangling by a civilian
That poor man.
HAHA!
That... works.
00,10oh god
:D
00,10that poor guy
Sheesh
NOW the alarm goes ofF?
:O

I can picture Shizu laughing her ass off right now.
00,10the car falling meens the guys head poped off

it's just the one guy
JRP2234: You just missed him.
brb, Helping my brother feed the parrot
It's one guy that can make many dangers though!
sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet
or not
No recoil.
hay
dat laugh
00,10rocket assasanation
Panda: if a rocket launcher had recoil, it would be broken
00,10sounds like my laugh
What the hell kind of assassination is that? Did they never think of running? XD
Got enough nades?
ALL the charges
GilDash!
Conyst: Oh, Holla! :)
On to the next gas station.
Ah, i see: His mission is to blow up al gas stations - that will induce local fuel crisis which will weaken the government and allow commiting a coup. meh, CIA 101,
....
*to commit
00,10oh dear she's armed
Run away?
At this point, everyone should just suicide and hope they dont respawn.
y u blow up all the water towers
Phase4: becasue chaos
Because Chaos.
Well then.
Shizuka is now discord?
Chaos is the currency I think, or score.
It's a Chaos Theory... CHECKMATE O_O
So, this is Discord's game then.
:D
Phase4: naw, just freedom force
hey
Heat level 1.... it doesnt increase?
Grand Theft Heli
Panda: I think Shiz's got cheats on.
Panda: probably becassue no game progress
GilDash, Shiz....
Dark_Horst: Nah, super cheats. :D
Klumzeedragon: maybe both?
/me pokes Panda.
You'll never catch me coppa!
Or maybe both! :o

I'm sorry, but the VA on this is laughable. XD
^
He's at a chlorine factory
He cleans floors for a living
00,10Shizuka should pick up taxi fares
Moment
this game makes a point of being over the top
13music working?
ya'll should see the final mission. no, i wont tell ya
no music here
no on the music
Missiles everywhere and no music
13oh winamp screwed up again
now it is
there we go
I hear something.
Acid is better than bleach for getting rid of bodies anyway. >_>
13oh that's annoying...
13no winamp control while in game...
13oh well
GilDash, just like all that chloriform? ;)
daaahh
Panda: I don't no nothing about that. <_<
00,10no media control on fancy g15 keyboard Shizuka?
Hm... I can has skype logs?
got a g110. works
before that, i had a g11
worked too
i miss my g11
G11... that's an experimental gun, isn't it?
uh.... huh.
Yeah
when it broke i wanted to get the same one. but scumbag logitech had stopped making it
and a keyboard
Fires caseless ammunition, I beleive.
00,10cousin lets go bowling
GilDash: heckler and koch, yes
dem physics
/me throws his logic out the window
RUBBER CAAAAARRRR
Similar design to the P90, where the ammunition is loaded in 'sideways' and is turned to fire forwards.
It just shoots the entire bullet casing and all
sup
That more bullet per shot
Conyst: caseless ammo has no casing
Conyst: Pretty much. It's "caseless ammunition."
That's 40% more bullet per bullet
/me jumps out to feed on AdamTheDuck's Logic
Conyst: So technically speaking, there is no casing.
i buckin love this game
hi!
Hello pony_455467
Ohai pony_455467
also had this nifty recoil-absorbing barrel
Hello
it would firre a three bullet burst and only recoil with the last bullet
Wonder if the buggati is in this game.
talk about reckless
they threw the rifle though
destructible trees?
to much heat
I think it also uses a rail for ammo feeding, like the p90
what is this i don't even
00,10rubber carrrrrr
difficult maintenance
Phase4, welcome to Just Cause 2
"Crazy damn pedestrians." Uh...
Phase4, please leave your logic and IQ beside the door when you enter.
Panda, to be fair they were on the sidewalk in a city with this guy around
AdamTheDuck, NO :<
I know this game more as Josh Cause
hi
Dark_Horst: Wasn't that because it fired so fast? Or am I thinking of metalstorm now?
Ohai wipergone2
hi
Very true, Phase4. And I see you are naked.... why?
GilDash: metal storm is something entirely different
Josh Cause sounds great
Dark_Horst: No, I know that. I meant the "three shots, one recoil" bit.
Panda, Phase is always nekked 'cause he's a rebel
stop hangin carians
Well that was mean.

and he has no cause
Dayum Phase4, why you so fabulous?
Phase4: nice colors~
oh no
GilDash: metal storm does that by igniting three bullets at the same time. the g11 had a sliding barrel
Something tells me shizu likes bondage.

Drive bus. Chaos +50.

00,10shizubusslines
GilDash: the force would get absorbed by the spring until the barrel hits the back of the gun with the last bullet
Ohai Scoot-Scootaloo :)
Dark_Horst: Aye, but it was electronically fired, so it could actually fire 3 bullets so quickly the recoil didn't have time to affect you until they had been fired.
-_-
Also, Happy Kwanzaa, everyone!
She was just.. Hanging... Out?
Ohai Scoot-Scootaloo :P

twilight_sprinkl|afk: it's supposed to be that way
You know, GTA was funny with the no friction thing, but this is funny *unmodded*.
twilight_sprinkl|afk: the game makes a poitn of "fuck physics, we got boom"
Heel flip.
what is the objective you know the point of this game..
GilDash: yeah but this isnt as priceless as the no-friction in gta
So, um...where are alll the other cars? :/

The main character's VA is average. Everyone elsee is silly-stupid. XD
GilDash: yeah i remember a perfect no-friction moment in one of the vids, i hope i can find it and post here at some point, its just a must-see
i'm pretty sure all these panauan voicesa re meant to be bad too
/me slaps JRP2234 with a large trout
It's like they picked random people off the street and said, "You! Want to be a VA?!"
i would be surprised if that car exploded
add me on wii u gais
wait it did!
guys, we call that thing parody
and i wasnt surprised ^^
exaggeration
or was i.... nope
WHAT?!?!?
OMG
That noise
being ridiculous is the whole point of this game. you notice that by how, for example, the health of bikes drastically decrease after ejecting so they can blow up as soon as they hit soemthing
XD get him!

bai
05where im chased in what i thought was england by agents
bye rd1985
Ohai Wrek
05now each tiem i managed to beat oen and steal his gun
05they never worked
dat car
It's times like these that make me wish criminals would take more of a parachuting rocket launcher wielding approach rather than simple robbery.
Wrek, ok?
05so i kept geting gunless
Wrek: Who gave you this information? >_>
00,10clearly the gun had one of those iff's on it wrek
05when i had shotguns firing at me :P
Wrek: Fingerprint protected triggers?
OMG
05on a a deagle? on a 1911 colt?
That’s because real agents use their bodies as weapons. Guns are just for intimidation
05puh-lease xD
we must now steal a plane
i once had a dream involving a very peculiar p90. it could shoot all fine and well. then there was that guy wo wouldnt be harmed by it. so i went "welp, looks like i need more boom". i then turned the gun around and fired from it's butt. that blew up half the town
this car sucks *sees a the same car but not damaged* now thats morelike it
what the...
would be fun if p90s worked like that
silly commercials
00,10gun one fire unless it's close to the watch
WTF!
00,10but then again it's a dream
soo i he on free mode or what?
BOOM
yea
Pepper seems so confused and I love it.

Like I said, ponies are GHEEEEEEEEEEEEY.
Sumica, ok
Dark_Horst: no u
what is this 'pony' you speak of?
Scoot-Scootaloo, go drunk, you're home.
someone needs to change the topic

brb
Panda: :D
hey do you like pepper

What do y'all think of the end of the world?
Pretty wierd, eh?
ok lets start a fan war of who is best pony. GO
-.- YEP
/me is a ghostie
UMM..
Scoot-Scootaloo, nope that was 5 days ago. Only bronies survived. Sadly.
The mayas never predicted anything
People said they did
HAHAHAHA everyone who survived were bronies :(
im not a bony...
*brony
00,10ah yeah seems the people that closed it forgot to change it
Bronies now populate the world
.....
Commence the repopulation?
Way to go, Mayans, way to go..
ima Legendary brony
Later
naw
fak u manays.
21 december= mayans april fools day
Who do they think they are, anyway? Saying things that fool dumb people >: (
The mayans worried about half of the world//
What we should be worried about is the mayonnaise predictions.
or maybe a quarte..
They're like FDR, excepet un-amercian >: (
they actually missed it by a couple weeks. it was predicting the end of twinkies
i got a friend called salty!
Wasn't their a Mayan prediction for something that will happen in 4221 or something absurd though about some vengeful god reawakening?
whenever i added pepper he always added salt..
except bronies because an episode came out the next day so they refused to believe it would end
^
I think they had a ritual in one of the temples about how its the end of the Old World and start of a New

00,10who da fak would want to go to prim?
HEY UNCALLED FOR
0,14...dayum, though I;d say that description is closer to Daigo's methods
dr
00,10Prim is that place that gets in the way between vegas and cali
/me rolls eyes
Hey!
dr
yeah
dr
i will call everyone who calls me dr a baby..
SaxyPretender: im sorry, but Infiltration is Diago if Diago drank several gallons of pure diesel fuel and Powerthirst
k d
0,14XD
k dr
Sumi, you mean it exists? Like its actually there?
0,14also, New Vegas music is...soothing
k doc
fine you tiny Baby
SaxyPretender: HE WENT UNDEFEATED THIS ENTIRE YEAR AT MAJORS
yay
0,14o_o
SaxyPretender I love me some 50's up to 60's music
00,10yes NinjazzMobile prim NV is a real place
how do you contend with that?
u ok dr?
ya
im a tiny baby!
I never really could get into the NV music. I liked FO3 music so much more
0,14yo, is he like the Bala of Brawl?
who watches g3 and down my little pony
00,10more commenly called state line
yaaaaaaaaaay
...
SaxyPretender: Infiltration?
wh woud yo ask that dr?
He plays street fighter...
stop calling me dr
he kind of won EVO
0,14well, up until EVO, Bala never lost at KOF (and yeah, I know who Infiltration is =P)
and 2-0'd Diago
cuz i got a rly rly surprisin secretz
the_real_pony_1604v2 Would say much of the music in FO3 was the more known 50's music and all. NV had alot more less known stuff but really really good ones
00,10it is 2 gasstations, 2 casinos, an outlet mall and a Mcdonalds
Lol. Didn't know that. Then again who cares about a place like that when vegas is just around the corner.
fine ill call you Dr.Pepsi
starts with d
ends with g
00,10infact I just saw one of the casinos in the game before wrek went in the building
SaxyPretender: The Bala/ Infiltration of Brawl is some Japanese dude. Used to be M2K until he got nervou
then a circle..
*nervous
That's freaky.
backwards is,
God
Pepper: doctor pepper good?
god? Dr.Pepsi
.....
be quiet
fine..
.......
haters hate mlp cause they thank about G3 not G4
i am quiet Dr.Pepsi
SaxyPretender: though come to think of it, Armada is currently the best at Melee, but Mango can just beat anyone including him given the right circumstances
rd1985: eenope
Im a dddddoooooggggg
rd1985: they hate it because they hate it
00,10hep a sad attempt at saying that is bufflo bills.

I'm back...I was still researching some pony knowledge, to my surprise, many people thinks that "The Mysterious Mare Do Well" was the most hated of last season. Mostly for Rainbow Dash.
cachi01|scribblenaut: No but's mister :I
That way, you'll know. You will hear. And you will be ready. To give them what they asked for, ponies.

Wii U is pretty awesome
Bronysith: i lovethe miiverse
I heard one can not invite friends to servers or something similar to that
0,14They did
eenope
cachi01|scribblenaut: nice, i like my vita, cant wait to beat persona 3 so i can get persona 4 golden for it
0,14it was called Wind Waker
No Saxy
It's called Majoras Mask
SaxyPretender: Sailing. That is all.
SaxyPretender: even before then, it was called majoras mask
cachi01|scribblenaut: I expect it to go down like the wii; you knw, only good game ending up being SB, and everyone saying it's for kids a year later.
/me takes Fenrir away <3
Mike|Led_Zeppelin: objection. so far every wii U game is awesome
cachi01|scribblenaut: Will you be playing them a year after you get them?
yes
Mike|Led_Zeppelin: For kids? It's already got Assassins Creed 3, Darksiders 2 and Monster Hunter 3 is coming out on it
cachi01|scribblenaut: because that's how I am with every game I want.
I love these new nicknames peopleare going by! SOO MLG <3
SaxyPretender, indeed. And then they made Twilight Princess too.
Fenrir: Is it toned down? or full game?
Mike|Led_Zeppelin: Full game
Fenrir: full game
Mike|Led_Zeppelin*
Fenrir: Hmmm
Majoras mask>ocarina of time
^
period
I might have to play this before I jump to conclusions then.
end of story
Bronysith: objection
Ill be back in a hour or so, in the mean time Ill be seeing you guys
later
/me glares at cachi01|scribblenaut
wind waker > oot > majoras mask
Bronysith: BLASPHEMY
NOTHING BEATS OoT
OoT was okay, but it was very story limited
cachi01|scribblenaut: false, OOT made zelda possible for 3d, majoras mask is my favorite though
Every character has a story to follow in Majoras Mask
kill anyone you want with a chainsaw or whatever you feel like
Fenrir: If you look deeper, there's more. It wasn't all up front about it.
rated E for everyone
i love scribblenauts :3
hmm
cachi01|scribblenaut: still funny
Fenrir: By that I mean in MM, the stories were easy to follow. In OoT, you had to look.

I haven't played New Vegas in a while...

All, What's your favorite band and song?
hitler did nothing wrong is best mountain dew
cachi01|scribblenaut: correct

Cypresswolf: It's an inside joke from 4chan.
I dont 4chan
not a joke.
well
good
it won a contest
Moons Tear, Theophany remix
Cypresswolf: They rigged the Mtn Dew name contest so 'Hitler Did Nothing Wrong' won
Cypresswolf: mountani dew did a contest to name their new soda
Cypresswolf: 4chan went to the rescue
thas what they get for askins internet srs bsns stuff
yo
Thats funny - how many votes did it get?
lel true
Hi mitamaking :)
Is this Fallout 3?
yep
no
Fallout NV
Almost as funny as the 'Get your school a Taylor Swift Concert thing' where they rigged it so 'Horace Mann's School for the Deaf' won.
Cypresswolf: http://hypervocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/leaderboard.jpg
Isn't that an expansion pack
Cypresswolf: i dont remember, but 4chan hacked the vote, it wasnt actual people votes
Mike|Led_Zeppelin: :D
twilight_sprinkle: Which one?
mitamaking: "name the dew"
or was it dub the dew
i think it was dub
What did they choose?
twilight_sprinkle: It was a code that voted asmany times as possible with as many IPs as possible
Cypresswolf: and this is how it ended http://www.manolith.com/files/2012/08/mountain-dew-4chan.jpg

No Bronysith, Wrek does not have a marefriend
KrazyNoobs: why not applejack?
And look what is inside her house. It looks good
Bronysith: Because overused memes
KrazyNoobs: Why not Rarity? ;3;

I always thought that RD vector was drawn as a perveted jooke.

There's no way that it isn't meant to be taken seriously
jcelios: I know
Mike|Led_Zeppelin: ahh yes, the daily "i want to $%$ inside of (pony name here)" thread

Wait...
I'm still not used to Phase4 being a mod
This sound familiar
:<*
lol
Bronysith: We do not speaketh of that here
OMG
Dat Octavia
DerpyMuffins: how so?
Well it's been a while since I've heard the Beatles!
indeed
I've always seen Phase4 as a techy
:3 sounds like beach music to me *dances around chair with drink in hand*
LadyCanary: Do you not listen to things you like?
/me will always be a techy at heart
I listen to things I like.
But I havent actually had a good long listen to the Beatles in a bit
LadyCanary: ah
/me casts agilao on Phase4 and suplexes him
yay~
DerpyMuffins: He's still a Techy, Just that he's now Promoted
Umm Wrek, where is her bow gonna go?
DerpyMuffins: in her hoof silly
I'm glad its midnight and everyone is asleep or I'd look pretty foolish right now :P
DerpyMuffins: and he's open to new commands
That position is incredibly inefficient.
That has to be the best trolling Cello ever
DerpyMuffins: It's a bass, not a cello
inb4 flame shit war
Not this again....
Cello vs Bass war is a go.
brb
I'm just not gonna even start
0,14I just call it a "big string thing"
/me hides in vault 4324
Wait, nv
i prefer Cello because i prefer the way it sounds, 'Bass' is a bleh word
I am thoroughly mistaken
no...
though i think the canon is that it's a Bass
it seems that a cello has 4 strings.
SaxyPretender it's obviously an oversized Ukulele
0,14indeed
^
I was thinking of a Viol, which has six.
Mike|Led_Zeppelin: you do realize you contradicted the internet right?
It's a cello.
i think the fandom is over the cello vs bass war
^
^^
Although the end piece is too short
plus it's clearly a trombone<_<
oh, blachi is gone ;3;
Conyst, clearly
http://dagobah.net/flash/my_little_destiny_generator.swf
Unless it's not even pulled out
If it were a bass, then the body would be larger than her.
isnt dagobah where luke went to find yoda?
Due to mathemetized pony sizes
I think Obi said Dagobah system
0,14yep, Phase4
Phase4: yes
thought same then i first was here
Systems in star wars are named after the most prominent planet
so
how bout them ponies?
so
/me glompels Phase4
Phase4: Totally overrated
/me hugs Bronysith back
I hope Wrek knows what an actual Cello looks like
Now it's all about the Pocket Whales
DerpyMuffins, let the Artist do his work
:P
Is this Rhapsody that's being played?
Is that Vinyl on the other side?
DerpyMuffins: shush or the imminent myriad truths will get to you

Sorry Wrek, just my OCD acting up

Excellent power metal I must say

Wrek: It seems that the neck of the cello is in a rather odd position.
DerpyMuffins, so you note the cello design and not the fact that wrek seems to be detailing things that will be obscured by it?
/me casts LOGIC
Obscuring?
Phase4: Being a music nut like me changes your train of thought
There is no logic only Zuul.
The Cello is doing all the obscuring

/me holds Conyst by his ankles
Help they have my ankles!
bye bye mane
Dont worry. its just Sith.
He wont do shit.
/me assualts Bronysith with muffins
LadyCanary gurl you on fiyah! XD

TwilightSonata: No.
;A;
/me disembodies Bronysith's hands so they are not holding conyst's ankles
TwilightSonata: GURRRLLLL are you using my word?
what hands Mike|Led_Zeppelin ? im using magic
humm
/me chuckles
Mike|Led_Zeppelin: or you could of just lick him
mfw there is no Pound or Pumpkin Cake in Desktop Ponies 1.42 :(
Scoot-Scootaloo: MMMMMMHHMMMMMM
That is MY word! You are NOT allowed to say it >: (
Scoot-Scootaloo: too MLG for you to handle~ ^_^
/me uses LICK!
Oh well, guess Ill have to wait longer
OHHHHHH NOW you bucked up!
It's snowing RDs on Fimfiction.....
Kinda hard to read shit
DerpyMuffins: Lawl
it IS raining RD
unfortunetly, the houses still dont have any interaction between...related ponies :/
Octavia is looking fantastic :)
/me sings along with Hey Hey What Can I DO
I realize ponies don't have eye brows
That or Wrek didn't give Octavia any
Its just a sketch for now.
DerpyMuffins: Theydo, just not visible, and some male ponis do
http://dagobah.net/flash/jive-machine.swf
Changes will be made. Calm.
To my memory, Mares pretty much have eyelashes
I COME IN PIECE!
Eyelashes=/= eye brows
http://www.theuselessweb.com/
click the button for random useless site
well...they do have eye brows afterall - expresses their emotions betters
13Mike|Led_Zeppelin: Do not post non-image links during a stream. You will not be warned again.
Mr_Anybody: What piece do you come in?
arms and legs
some assembly require
Shizuka: Sorry. I thought it only applied to videos.
aww i love dagobah calendar
had to think about that one for a bit - found me some vodka in place of whiskey tonight
apperantly, I silenced the chat a bit with that last one...nevermind that drunken stallion behing the screen :P
Cypresswolf: I do mind
http://i.imgur.com/4xINK.jpg
Bronysith: That doesn't make sense
Is it just me or all ponies furry?
Bronysith: LOLOLOLOL
Mike|Led_Zeppelin: have you not seen monsters inc?
Bronysith: Nt in years
they are atleast fuzzy, DerpyMuffins
DerpyMuffins: May be, the animation is not of large enough detail to determine, we guess it would be in terms of anatomy...

Bronysith: lol
I remember that she was in the costume, but I don't remember the other guy
-_-
Bronysith: Please don't copypaste straight from Reddit please
Mike: Redundant sentence is redundant
13as though 4chan produces anything original
>Reddit
>original
Shizuka: 4chan creates 90% of internet trends
did someone say...
REDDIT?
yes, Buytoast
134chan also creates 90% of crap
how horrifying
4chan is the reason for most memes
crap == internet trends
134chan is the reason the general public fears the internet
that's mostly /b/
Shizuka: I cannot disagree.
Shizuka: What abou Rtten.om
13the rest of 4chan has sure done a lot to distance themselves from the cesspit that is /b/
My fav boards are /v/, /co/, /b/ and, of course, /mlp/
13oh wait, no they haven't
*Rotten.com
not saying they aint
just saying /b/ is what usually comes to people's minds
http://i.imgur.com/ydP3B.jpg
nemo
The relevance of those images.
Bronysith so true
http://i.imgur.com/ZcN8I.jpg
4chan makes the best memes, and then 2 months after 4chan hates them, the rest of the internet follows along.
Bronysith: That is older than it's filetype
Except the whole bronynet got tired of gak in the first 2 commercials.
Bronysith: :D
Bronysith: It's artifacts hurt my eyes
Wreky, when you get the chance, if you dont mind, could you play Gamma Ray? If you cant thats okay ^^"
Bronysith: to the fb idiots: You're leaving this planet, I'm staying!
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
KrazyNoobs: It's so old the jpeg artifacts are bigger than the image
ouo: no
ouo: YES
>mfw
i listen about 4chan

For the love of...

If you're going to talk in memes, go on 4chan
>What do?
13seriously
NOW it's getting really annoying.
LadyCanary: >Talk in memes
Yeah, I'll stop, and watch the others continue.
You better shut up with your 4chan shit or you're gonna get kicked.
0,5What seems to be the obstruction
You complain about it, yet you talk in green text.
13watch wrek art or go circlejerk each other on 4chan
o hai BaconMane
KrazyNoobs: Sober test, then meet ponies
What
It appears as though we got some newfoals here
Cypresswolf: :)
no just idiots Scoot-Scootaloo
Scoot-Scootaloo: Where does it say I can't quote in '>' format?
Looks like Foal season came early!
Scoot-Scootaloo: Could we now start the ritual?
0,5I enjoy myself some nice cooked foal.

Good drawing is good
Mike|Led_Zeppelin: It is now a Precedent
Scoot-Scootaloo: kk
i wonder what horse would taste like
So, are we going to leave the faux greentext?
Scoot-Scootaloo: k
Because that's my job. (used to be)
All the foals come during the new episodes.
That's what I thought.
Now then, carry on and stop being a floozy.
I still need to text laugh at LadyCanary' quote 'Talk in memes'

RaveBrony: Arguments, arguments everywhere

Who dares enter Uncle Sam's Sanctuary?
Yes Shizuka,I just said that to him -_-
RaveBrony: Great, I need to write down stuff to get tomorrow
So many kill steals tonight, eh?

KrazyNoobs: So i noticed o_o
Shizuka: mercy of mods
Shizuka does't like me
0,5Me and Shizu will combo kill
13I have been merciful, you weren't banned the last six times I've warned you.

Gosh did you know that Majora's Mask was made based on a Bet between Miyamoto and Aonuma the bet was to develop Majora's Mask in less than 1 year. However the game took 1 year and half to be made so Aonuma lost the bet and was forced to develop Ura Zelda (Master Quest)
They are also so stupid. they trust everyone

Soooooooooooo.......... wtcha all doin (not in a creepy way).
its not easy making 'good' stuff
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1tAYmMjLdY listening to this
What is this slideshow about? or is it just random
but apparently it's pretty easy to make garbage
it takes dedication and lots of hard work
you know, since that video was a prime example
its better than what you would make
Alright now for Non-stop climax mode
they still havent released children of the night i see
:I
I had fun in Hard despite the difficulty so it shouldn't be too bad
wait what?
no Witch Time?
If you don't like the video hen why are you wathcing it?
yeah
it doesn't have to be better than anything i'd make
http://derpy.me/M2UMH
in the end it's still aterrible video
The n don't watch it.
lol
now im waiting for this animation to be done: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijzMnFr-8Tc

funny how you dont appretiate work
hell yeah we organized of lucnhtimers

i appreciate work if it's good
Seriously I'm almost ready to give up on completion of Bayonetta
and the "epic" rap battle stuff is all terrible
I mean no Witch Time? Seriously?
you have no good taste
Rap battles are mediocre
for simple laugh
^^
i'd rather have poor taste than taste bad enough to like the rap battles
it's nothing exceptional

I hate LPS because MLP only had 13 episodes because of it. :(
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCrLMwDz5qE
If you force yourself to like something you won't be critical and if you're not critical you'll sugar-coat the artist which will lead the guy to not improve
How do you chnge tsxt color?
I hope Littlest Pet Shop doesn't go into a second season. If it doesn't, we may have 26 episodes in Season 4
mods only
KrazyNoobs, actually MLP now has almost 62 episode up
anypony see that discords spose to be in episode 10
dont force myself to like something ....i give them a chance not force
pony_666, have you seen that ban hammer?
wait waaaaa
lel
what>
??
I don't care how many episodes they're are as long as they are good I'll watch i.
What I mean is, Hasbro made them do 13 of LPS and 13 of MLP instead of 26 of MLP... at least if the 13 episodes are of better quality, its good.
is that...
A RULE VIOLATION?
05pony_666: have you read our rules or FAQ?
no...
KrazyNoobs, and I mean that you have enough MLP episode to enjoy the series
look out man
Quality over quntity?
pony_666 YOu ruined everything for me.
be lucky they actually give 13 new episode
pony_666 I HATE YOU
05have you read the IRC chat topic?
lel
thats just mean
>people not reading rules
05pony_666: this place is zero tolerance agaisnt discussing unaired episodes.
nothing new here
Guys, please tell me what pony_666 said isn't true, i want it to be surprise
sorry missed that when i read the faq

They should have made a 2 week interval between each episode so we would only have to wait 6 months instead of 8...
KrazyNoobs, will you die when MLPFiM is over?
you know the more new ponies they make, the more merchandise they can sell
they are making wait longer
me
so wait is the new episode coming up the 9th episode?
probably will be up another half hour, whats up?
CrystalPhoenix: MLP:FiM will never be over. If DHX Media and The Hub discontinue it, the bronies will still make their own episodes
nothing much, you?

AdamTheDuck, depends were you here during the mod battle?

ohai Imadolphin ^_^
Just as I am a Conyst.
ah good
i prefer they end the show at a certain point so that we wont have shitty episodes
tl;dr
'amazing fandom' I lol'd
Although Hasbro is stupid... they would cancel G4 and make an all new G5 that is just like G3.5, and expect all of us to like it...
G4.5? anyone?
:P
Jmo: IS our fandom not amazing?
/me is dead floating in water

i see someone is trying to break game physics again, must be phase stream
Halo 3?
nope
Some game I've never heard of?
twilight_sprinkle, indeed it is :P
btw tf2 soldier rocket launcher physics are wrong
I could play PS2 with them but I don't know how to play PS2 so I would just screw everything up XD
KrazyNoobs: if this was halo 3, you would've seen elites running around :3
KrazyNoobs: this is planetside 2, aka ps2
Never heard of it
Never seen Halo before either
D:
The only First Person shooter game I have every played is TF2.
you have not played PS2 nor halo?
lawl
blasphemy D:
physics are getting back at phaes
lol it spawns upside down
Ponies47: and cus, this is a MMOFPS game
you'll get shot easily
depending where you spawn of course
this game looks to slow to me
*too
walk for 20 minutes, get killed in 1
twilight_sprinkle: think of this game as TF2 but open world
thelonecubone: nah its not tf2 at all
true
It's Battlefield in a sci fi open world
hes only walking 20 mins cuz hes not spawning on the frontline
Now I shall resume doing science with Phase!
lul
FOR SCIENCE!!

/me flips table
HI

if you want science, play portal!
WTTTTTTF
science created windows 8
(portal 2)
if you want science play Castlevania 64!
if there were enough staff, that might be possible :p
Yup
Kazur: no. I'm talking about aperture science
or
they could embed a synctube playlist on one of them
And im talking about TOWER OF SCIENCE
full of pone
but they probably won't want to do that.
Kazur: Rule 1#. Never question the pinkie logic
I think the streamr is slightly confused
For science!
This game is really boring if you dont have a team of friends on skype or something
I was just watching Modern Family, and the teenage girl accidentally got a Princess Celestia bedsheet instead of the one she wanted. Anyone else see this?

Don't have it downloaded on this comp
I got this 6 year old to trade 6 ref for a Kritzberg
I do every once in a great while.
Kritzberg is 1 scrap
I used the nametag to call it "Strange Medigun", and he thought he was getting a rare item for a cheap price
So you scammed a child who obviously did not have full knowledge of what the trade consisted entirely.
You must feel so good about yourself.
Bravo.
He was crying on his mic whenever he died, he saw it coming.
05And people wonder why peopel are assholes
ikr
I just don't think kids should use their mics
Just mute them >.>
He was using his big brother's account anyway
Is it that hard?
LOL
Mate, the point still stands.
You did wrong on your part.
I'm sorry I talked about it
It was meant to break silence
05but you are not sorry for your action
05which is the sadder part

Ponies. Sleep.
Shoo.
I gave the kid some admin priviledges
11,02*squees*
Jmo, :<\
He is now able to have a trail follow him and he can play saysounds.
Even with your gifts of placatidy, the consequences of your actions will echo throughout the halls of the future boy.

Go to bread PoniesSleepies47
^^^
^^
Your bread is calling you PoniesSleepies47
Fine fine I'm going I'm going~
To donate to my server, it is normally 8 keys per priviledge, so I gave him two priviledges, if that makes you feel better.
If you're only doing this so we like you more, that's just sad. You should be doing it for your own conscience, not us.
I am
I don't care what you think
The sins that stain your slate of life cannot be cleansed.
I just thought I should have given him something back
/me slaps KrazyNoobs
You're 17 bro, you should really know better.
/me bitch slaps KrazyNoobs
k, sorry
05you should jsut have traded it back
In the end you will be judged, and you will be found wanting.
11,02Give him back his stuff.
KrazyNoobs, What SB said
Sorry I even talked about the scam.
Give the kid back his stuff
^
...
I'm just a lurker and I concur. :\
hes gone again
Dat rage quit
He'll be back later.
Yeah
He made SuperBrony64 serious. That takes effort :|
Jmo, yeah he will
^^
Yeah. Make SB not act silly...
That's very difficult to do
So you think.
let me ask something
Oh really Jmo? Then what do you call this? [1:11:00 AM] SuperBrony64: moooo o3o
hm
Ok, we'll letcha. But just this once, texasboykc09
I call that childish, what of it?
11,02>tells chat about scam trade he did to a kid
11,02>doesn't expect negative response
SuperBrony64, how much does it to make you mad?
PoniesSleepies47: Hey, Mooing is srs bsns.
Gold_Demona, thanks
Gold_Demona, D:

11,02texasboykc09: Someone who acts like a jerk.

SuperBrony64, wow some people can do that verey easy then
11,02texasboykc09: Indeed, but you don't want me acting serious at that point.
How imtimidating.
intimidating*
SuperBrony64, i'll make sure i dont push you that far.
WB agian KrazyNoobs
01,04Intimidating is quite the understatement o-o
Ponies, you said you were sleeping.
Did you give the kid his stuff back KrazyNoobs?
05pfft
Ponies, I thought you were gonna go to bread

SuperBrony64 really likes cows, does he? :3
I love horses :>
Sorry if i caused trouble few minutes back
SuperBrony64, imagine the ping luna gets every time luna shows up in a ep.
Yes because 'sorry' fixes everything.
KrazyNoobs, No don't just be sorry! Think for one bucking second!
11,02i got to see the cows almost every day at college ;u;
I liek trains 8D
i gave him 2 admin priviledges (he gave me 2 keys, I gave him 16keys worth of priviledges)
11,02they all went moooo \^-^/
KrazyNoobs, Nope. Give the kid his crap back
^
^^
I thought I should have done that, he felt guilty because he used some of his older brother's items.
KrazyNoobs, He gets to keep what ever you gave him to
Ponies47: I gave him a Strange Sticky Bomb Launcher in return anyway
>.>
KrazyNoobs, Nope. Give him his metal
Look, I did what I wanted to do, I gave the kid way too much already.
Give him back what you scamed from him
No questions
I'll leave it at that, his brother didn't have admin priviledges and any stranges before.
11,02If you really care for the kid, you'd give him back his items.
KrazyNoobs, give it back to him
Dayum, everypony's mad at me again.
what did you do?
11,02Why are you dumb enough to mention it here and not expect negative comments about it?
I was very stupid to mention it.
aniderp|bestcakeever, He scamed a child
aniderp|bestcakeever, scammed a kid
05KrazyNoobs: actually
what did he scam the kid of?
aniderp|bestcakeever, in TF2
05you were very stupid to do it in the first place
D:
11,02So yeah, you want our respect back, trade him his stuff back.

Justice shall come with a thunderous roar and consume you to sate the hunger of hatred.

can i go on attack mode?
Repent.
REPENT.
aniderp|bestcakeever: Not yet

/me will be right back, just going to finish one thing

The calm will come before the storm of vengeance.

This is either a lose/win situation or a win/lose situation, everyone on the server is raging at me for being nice to him, and everyone here is raging at me for being mean to him... I asked him to give back the Kritzberg for the 2keys, although none of you witness me doing it, there was so much pressure applied to me. Forgive for doing it and mentioning it, now I have some 6 year old with admin priviledges.
GET YOUR ASS ON DA WII U MR SuperBrony64
/me slap AdamTheDuckm texasboykc09 and thelonecubone with cupcakes
tl;dr

SuperBrony64: in 2014 you will add me right? D:
11,02aniderp|bestcakeever: I added you though D:
i mean on wii u
xD
11,02You sent me a friend request on there? o3o
that was 3DS
not wii u.. o.O
SuperBrony64 i did now add me
I've worked hard to be part of this community, but if I'm an admin on the TF2 server anyway, people automatically respect me, so I did what was right.
been waiting 3 days
11,02JRP2234: I will o3o
If you hadn't scammed the kid in the FIRST place, KrazyNoobs, you wouldn't be IN this pickle.
KrazyNoobs, you dint did every thing right yet
Neither would I have been if I kept my mouth shut in the first place.
SuperBrony64 den we play blops2
11,02JRP2234: Awesome :D
I did everything, everyone on my server hates me, let's leave it at that. The kid has his metal + 16 key worth of admin priviledges, I ain't giving no more.
SuperBrony64: when i get a wii u im gonna make some pretty drawings!
omg
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/7ef797a629deb506f5cdbbc931c7bf85.png

im waiting for the zelda gfame to come out so i can get it with the wii u
None of you know how much pressure I was under back there.
Havok: adorable ^w^
11,02aniderp|bestcakeever: Yay :D
then you can save me a wii u friend spot?
Havok: dawwwwww
SuperBrony64 hurry up
05why would you do that?
05jesus
05how hard was it to go "look i scammed you ehres your 6 refined back and im sorry"
05no need to over fuckign do it :|
^
Yeah, the admin privileges were unnecessary
Wrek: I gave it back. I lost 16 keys and a Strange "Hale's Own" Stickybomb Launcher in the progress.
wat
11,02Good.
Who scammed who, and what got lost? ;-;
11,02Your fault for doing it in the first place.
sad part is me knowing this might happen again
11,02Learn your lesson and move on.
Havok, KrazyNoobs scammed a kid
oh lulz
bad krazy
Havok: I scammed this annoying little kid, I was stupid enough to boast about it here, everyone raging against me, I overdo what I give back to him just so that everyone here will stop raging at me, people still hating on me on my own server.
Shut up and move on now.
I'm not going to revoke those priviledges anyway
He's having fun with them
Point is you fixed it
And yes, Jmo, that would be a good idea.
Idunno why
And I lost 16 keys.
PoniesAsleep47, you still here
But this sounds kinda like a scooby doo thing
So, how about them muffins, huh?
"If it wasn't for you, i'd gotten away with it"

SuperBrony64: Although I feel happy for what I have done here, you need to appreciate I have lost a lot of respect on MY OWN SERVER.
Gold_Demona: like the muffin shaped pillow?
I'
aniderp|bestcakeever: Yesh, I wubs it :>
/me huggles the muffin-shaped pillow
respect and be earn again in the future
I'm just surprised you can't grip two simple words that are 'move on'
It happened, it's over.
Quit making a fuss out of it.
^
What happens in your server is your own problem, not ours.
^
^^
^^^
Have a muffin instead, KrazyNoobs. =D
Moving on.
Gold_Demona: look intside the zipper of the pillow :>

Cypresswolf: i wish i could, But i have pets in my end at the time :/
^
enough*
There is no place on the internet where Le Face doesn't get you banned
Cannot wait until ouo comes... he'll be kicked first moment.
KrazyNoobs, better shutup before Wrek kicks you again
line it up right and it kills everything XD
until a pyro shows up anyway
texasboykc09: WHy would he kick me? I am following the rules. Plus I was autokicked for using Le Lenny Face.
Which I cannot use anymore
been leaving her in my brother's bathroom during the day, until he decides to come back and get something out of his room, then he's gone again *shrugs*
Cypresswolf, keep the her in a room with food and water
05KrazyNoobs ouo is banned
she's got plenty of food and water...problem is the mess she leaves around the house at night when I cant watch her
Wrek: Oh, that, I believe.
Wrek: They should have just had it turned into Pinkie's G3 Face
the lenny face
But there are many variations of it...
Yeah, autokick would probably be the best route to go

Man I stayed up for hours making so I can have interactive ponies on my desktop
bye everypony
Bye texasboykc09 :)
Good night texasboykc09, have a good sleep!
bye
thanks for the stream Phase4
oh, the lottery newpaper arrived
and I forgot again which B Movie I wanted to enter >.<
Anyone else have this Desktop pony thing?
:P
I do
Yeah it slows down your computer a little bit though
PonyFan10154 what?
I have it but I don't use it
I don't really see a difference in speed on my computer
its this think I got from a youtube video where you can have ponies walking, flying, doing stuff on your desktop
just to tak who dosen't know
oh
Yeah it's sweet
we can put links here?
270 damage XD
I have my OC in my Desktop Ponies, so I sometimes have her walking around my screen. =)
or the rules...
from one shot
Well, it's 13:37 here... time to leet
tak025, image links yes
Phase4: i have a 350+ ping -_-
woah he talks
oh okay ty
tak025, if a stream is going on, you can only do image links.
Gold_Demona: :)
Eli, sucks don't it :P
I have 193 ping lol
high ping is a problem with high speeds
well ill read the rules
SO if phase like a creator or something?
/me is now vacuuming
400hp scout
tak025: That would be a good idea. It will be helpful
no trolls i like that rule:)
tak025: Well... I am a troll on other places, but not here. They should change that to "no trolling"
And yes, I think that is a great rule.
of course :P
well gtg
It makes this place better, as other places are raided constantly by haters.
bye everypony
Bye tak025.
yeah u have reason
cya all:)
cya!
We get the occasional troublemaker looking to stir something up, but I like to have fun with those. =)
Bye tak025 :)
Goodnight BronyState :P
Night Ducky
Night AdamTheDuck
And yet of the 24 items in my Wishlist, only 3 of them are FPSes (Guns of Icarus, Fallout 3 and Fallout NV
)
Plus, everyone is nice here
We have our moments. :P
Gold_Demona: Yeah, kind of like an hour and a half ago, and sometimes, a few here argue about stupid stuff.
Gold_Demona: Mod wars are the best
I've not seen one of those on here.
What happened an hour and a half ago?
If they do have any conflicts, I imagine they take it to private chat.
Kandarihu: Best if you didn't ask =/
Kandarihu: I was stupid enough to blurt out that I scammed a little kid on TF2, and everyone was raging at me to give it back. I did, but the people on the server that I was an admin of started raging at me.
Just couldn't keep quiet you could you.
I decided I would do what the nice people wanted instead of what the people who already hated me wanted.
Jmo: Jeez, I'm not starting the whole thing up again. It's solved.
It's been solved.
The kid is on my friends list.
End of story
So you only got in trouble when you tried to make things right?
Kandarihu: No, I was being stupid.
Kandarihu: He tried to make things right after we trounced on him for gloating about it. :P
And I regret everything I did.
cant hit a minisentry XD
Silence...
chat died
/me throws peanuts at the chat
/me noms peanuts
I notice that Phase4 seems to be ... I don't know, overstuffing his rocket-launcher and flying or something.
yup
/me looks for large trout
/me doesn't have one
/me slaps chat with a small salmon
KrazyNoobs, my slap of choice is a large seapony.
no one pushing blue cart :/
Kandarihu: I used to have a seapony, but I threw one at the chat a few hours ago.
whats that soundtrack?
Hai guiz
I throw muffins! 8D
kinda sounds like makkon
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNvxjCDOc34&list=UUmMWwYyeQlZzbeynRJwCSGg
/me throws muffins at everyone
/me looks for something to throw
oh, thats cuz it IS makkon :D
/me throws yoghurt containers at chat
/me looks for another item to throw

Hi wipergone2
/me throws KrazyNoobs food
/me throws wipergone2 some muffins

/me looking for, yet, another item to throw at the chat
/me eyes pass half eaten pizzas
/me eyes pass soda can
Aw, here we go!
/me throughs spoon at the chat
Well, that's all I've got.
weeeeeeeeeeee
Yay, someone said something!
Somewhere, an Engie just yelled, "SENTRY DOWN!"
Hate it when I am an engie and I built a Sentry, I am hiding somewhere near the sentry, in a VSH server. Hale comes by, takes 30 seconds to destroy the sentry without being blown back halfway across the map, and then the engie yells "SENTRY DOWN", and my hiding place is exposed.
i get keeld

Bye Havok :)
Heya, guys!
XD
Ohai JunkerKun_ :)
MLP_Brovakiin: Kinda silent here =/
I know right :I
MLP_Brovakiin: So, how have ya been lately?
Good thank you JunkerKun_, how've you been? :)
MLP_Brovakiin: Not bad. Mostly. =)
Good to hear :)
Hmm, to buy Super Meat Boy or not?
I love super meat boy :D
Kandarihu: DO IT FILLY
I never completed it though, it made me rage >.>
Kandarihu: Sure, buy it. It good
Kandarihu: But be ready to scream "FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUU" a lot
And I mean A LOT
lol
The thing is, I recently did a tally of my budget and found that if every game on my wishlist goes -75%, I'll have just enough money to cover everything. Now there's not much chance of everything on my wishlist getting that, though. But I really want to save up for a controller after this.
Also, Super Meat Boy isn't among the games on my wishlist.
Kandarihu: Controller?
JunkerKun_, you know, an ad-hoc game input. SMB seems to be built for that.
Kandarihu: You mean GamePad?
thankfully only chrome has implimented sdch so far
this spec is silly complicated
JunkerKun_, controllers are also called gamepads.
Kandarihu: Well, I hear that name very rare lately. It is called gamepad or joystic more often, since mouse too can be called a controller as well as trackball
i don't like some of this spec
Well, looks like one more game on my wishlist is too much for my little laptop. So long Dark Souls. That game would've killed me worse than most people who try to survive in that game.
So fine. I'm buying Super Meat Boy, then.
Kandarihu: Mhm. My friend tried to play Dark Souls. I've never heard anything from him anymore
JunkerKun_, the only reason I'm taking Dark Souls off of my wishlist is because it requires a better GPU than what my laptop has.
Kandarihu: I sure hope yours is not integrated in MB
So I've just read an AMA of TheZam, also known as the OP of the first episode thread in /co/ two years ago.
Alright. It's done. I bought the game, but I'm gonna have to wait to get home before I can install it.
Kandarihu: Good luck. You will need it
JunkerKun_, I think I can be persistant enough to beat it. But I really would appreciate a controller for this.
Hai everypony
So I probably won't be playing this game right off the bat. I have lots of other games on my plate.
Kandarihu: I don't know. I'm more comfortable to play it on keyboard. Perhaps just because I always played this kind of games on it =/
DerpyMuffins: Hey
Hey Phase4 nice stream
Now that Dark Souls is off of my wishlist, the most expensive game that's still on there is Trackmania United. Not sure if that's gonna be -75%
Then again, a full franchise pack for Fallout would probably hit me harder at -75%
Kandarihu: How much is it at your place?
JunkerKun_, how much is what?
Kandarihu: Fallout pack. How much does it cost
?
JunkerKun_, if it were the entire franchise going -75%, it would cost $19.95
Kandarihu: Interesting - I don't have Fallout franchise pack in Steam...
Only full Bethesda pack
JunkerKun_, hmm, true. It's not here either. I guess I could just call it a franchise pack if all the fallout games go -75%
Kandarihu: Ah, now I get it =) Well, chances are quite low. Sadly
wow, this is an awesome server
JunkerKun_, has New Vegas ever been -75% off before?
Kandarihu: No, I don't believe so. Not sure about Ultimate edition though

wat
pinball machines
Hey everyone. :)
Are awesome.
theres so many pinball machines
Heya male_writer :)
Yep, pinball machines are indeed awesome! A classic arcade game that will last forever.
I need 30 pinball machines
dammit, 3rd time I fell asleep in my chair today
Alchemist, maybe you need to rest
Well, it's time to get packed up to head for home. The kitties are gonna be glad to see us, and they'll smell our folks' dogs, I hope.
CrystalPhoenix: I do, but its only 4 pm here.
I had a terrible night
Alchemist, just lay down a couple of minute
and still have shit to do
I say just a couple of minutes
maybe youre right
I can't speak for anyone else but for me just laying down feels soooooo good sometimes
screw it, brbr gonna take a 30 min nap
so good that you'll be ready to do stuff in a manner of minutes
That is all I need when I get sleepy is 30 minutes, or even a couple of minutes.
CrystalPhoenix: I did that one day. And then woke up in middle of night, while remembering that I layed down at 5 PM
wow what did you do?
I mean what did you do to be that tired?
Um... sleeping only 4 hours per day
Whole week
dude
that's bad
Oh, gosh, that isn't much sleep at all
Yeah, I guess I have to sleep more
Did Phase4 crash?
6 hours would be understandable
But with all the sleep I get, I still feel tired around 12 to 2 in the afternoon everday.
male_writer, overslept
indeed i do sometimes.
it's also good to wake up early
and have some good breakfast
well, yea, that is true.
HAha breakfast
Pft. Overslept. I was oversleeping when after week like this woke up at 6PM
Haven't had breakfast in years
Waffles is my choice of breakfast most of the time
male_writer: Nah. I like sandviches better
Well, yea, me too. My choice of a good breakfast sandwich PB&J
male_writer: And...I like it with ham...
And some hot sauce maybe...
oh, cool.
Hot sauce?
Also, I wanted to wake up so not to miss an episode of my new favorite show.
Time zones baby
DerpyMuffins: Chilli sauce
It helps if you're in the right time zone
That is true.
The strangest sandwich I've had is avocado and PB
Well, my favorite sandwich with PB on it is PB and banana
you know, out of all the food I have tried, I never tried an avocado
male_writer: me neither
oh, okay. But with me, I do like to try all sorts of foods.
http://derpiboo.ru/194608
What do you write male_writer?
oh, right now I mainly write poetry, but also I am currently working on a story. i am stuck on Chapter Five though, I got Writer's Block for the time being
oh, love that SpeccyRush.
I suggest giving Fimfiction a visit
Fimfiction or fanfiction?
http://i.imgur.com/shdVa.jpg
Ethier or
Well, this is it. I'll see you next time mom and I stop off at a McDonalds.
Speaking of fanfiction, I have been thinking of writing a fanfic of MLP, but with my character from my story I am currently writing.
I would refrain from adding OC until you know what you are doing
Welcome back DerpyMuffins
My browser crashed
I know how that is.
Thank you for that advice though DerpyMuffins about writing a fanfic. :)
male_writer: would taht make it a HIE story?
No one likes those
And I mean NO ONE
DerpyMuffins: yyep
DerpyMuffins: also hi. liked your last chapter ;)
Of?
oh, okay. Well, then I would have to exclude my character then.
DerpyMuffins: the thought that counts
Oh
I need to get off my lazy butt and write the next chapter
DerpyMuffins: tell me about it...
If I may be honest, I have just started watching MLP a week ago, but I have got hooked on it now! :D
i'm like "oh i'm gonna be producitve today!2
"
and < happens
To be honest writing MLP isn't that easy
Oh, okay. Well, I thought about writing a fanfic of another show that I absolutely love, but haven't figured out how to do it
DerpyMuffins: eh. i just write. so far no one noticed that i sliped up and used "hands" in once chapter, and i'm not corecting it until someone notices
DerpyMuffins: Not harder than writing CDRR =D
one*
ohai everyone
Hi there ekips
So if i decide to write a fanfic of MLP, make sure it isn't HIE, right?
Yup
Or anything like MLD
male_writer: just think of something original (no HIE/Alicorns/hatefic) and you will get nice results
What is HIE anyway?
Naw. Just make sure it's nothign contrived.
oh, okay. Human in Equestria
Humans in Equestria
Ah, got it
And just asking, what is MLD?
extremists have occupied a school in my city this morning O.o
ekips: wut? O_o
male_writer: actually HIE is pretty popular with the younglings on fimfiction, but i think most smart ppl can't stand it
You wanna know what's funny?
I had filly Twilight abused and got a like for it
they want to open an "alternative youth centre"
oh, okay Eli. Well, what if the human in the story is a young child?
Still no
Wait. It's going somewhere.
ekips: alternative... what now?
male_writer: ... it's still a human in equestira. and that's soooo G1
oh, okay.
If it's not a young man, it's already more original.
of course their request was denied, in reaction they occupied a school
Children in equestria are BARELY done.
JunkerKun_ a place where kids can meet and evolve and stuff
Ninjazz: and then ship with mane6 or princess
I read some fanfics on fanfiction where the child is usually a girl, and i like them
Whats going on guy's?
Hi there DoctorDoctorWho
Eli, we're talking children here...right?
We talking about fictions
ekips: eeeeeeer.... like... kindergarten? Or school maybe? I honestly don't get it.
ProTip: male_writer. Be carefull with mane 6 ships. They have quite the personality, and you can fuck it up fast
I did
DerpyMuffins: I just wrote an engine for my Pony horror game and got nothing for it T__T
oh, okay.
JunkerKun_ A youth centre is a place where kids and adolescents can meet up in their freetime to do fun activities. It's self-organized, so there are no adults
morning everypony :)
DerpyMuffins: the story from you i'm actually reading, is alternate universe. tehre you have liberties
Hai cachi01|scribblenaut
Well Im not DOING a mane six ship! So ha!
Good morning cachi01 :)
Well, like I started with my other show, I will maybe write a poem for each character of the show.
JunkerKun_ we have tons of them here, but of course not led by extremists/fascists
ekips: Oh. Still don't understand how is capturing school can help =/
JunkerKun_: ponny horror game? nice!
pony*
JunkerKun_: what is it going to be about?
JunkerKun_ it's the extremist's form of expressing their oppinion
cachi01: ponies. who would have guessed?
You know...It kinda frightens me that we've gotten to the point where thinking that HiE automatically assumes it's a guy in equestra trying to bang all the ponies. A child in Equestria actually kinda sounds good.
Eli: lel
cachi01: About Twi exploring strange basement
Anyone read about the farmer who milks Rarity?
Ninjazz: sorry, but finding a good HIE story, is like searching for the hay in the needle pile
what if the child tries to do so
Well, most of the HiE fanfics has the Human being portrayed as evil I think.
Which they should.
Humans=evil
DerpyMuffins: came across it. didn't read.
Eli, that I'll agree with. I avoid them usually.
DerpyMuffins: D:
The reason I asked child though is because my character from my story I am writing is a young child.
Too much of the same.
male_writer: Meh. In my oppinion humans are either extinct in MLP world or just don't exist at all
Very true JunkerKun_
male_writer: that would be nice, but it's more like "oh human. so sexy." and all ponies run after him like flies a piece of shit.
which is a pretty acurate description
Mary Sue=bad writing
DerpyMuffins: that too. yes.
Eli: and then poor human is slowly dying under their hooves
DerpyMuffins: wait for it...
JunkerKun: I wish.
Eli: Becoming more and more like a pancake on pan
There is one fanfic on fanfiction about a soldier who is in Equestria
lots
A word of advice
Don't sexually abuse a filly and you'll be fine
DerpyMuffins: riiiiiiiiight
There is one fanfic that touched me, and that was a fanfic about the CT shootings, it wasn't bad or anything, it was just the mane 6 talking to the people of CT
DerpyMuffins: Because a hoof to the jewels is just not good
I have read fics where that happen
i used to follow a HiE fanfic which i lvoed. but then he started shipping with twilight, RD and fluttershy
Eww
ikr
Well, if I do a HiE, if i do, I won't pair my character off with any of the ponies.
Anyone read Milking the Milkmare?
DerpyMuffins: Nope. Last thing I've read is Silent Ponyville 3
male_writer: i don't read "media fics" like that. where something is portrayed that's popular in teh media right now.
It's exactly what the title implies
You milk a pony
MILK
DerpyMuffins: milkmare of trottingham?
oh, i don't blame you Eli. That fanfic though was touching, especially Rainbow Dash's part
male_writer: actually i don't get why people do HIE at all...
^
a human in equestria, for whatever reason, it makes NO sense
Well, like I said, I will start out by writing a poem for each pony, like I have done with my other show.
MLD pushed it
Eli: Because they want to be there or maybe just... of, buck it, I don't know
MARY SUE INBOUND! http://web.archive.org/web/20070808050826/http://www.salon.com/comics/comics4961223.html
Really pushed it
overrated fanfic
male_writer Before you write ANYTHING go read Background Pony
I will tell you what pushed it DerpyMuffins, and it still haunts me, and that is the whole Cupcakes thing
I recomend writing something nice, with mayve one or two background ponies
DoctoDoctorWho: 10/10 :D
maybe
Cupcakes were ehh
why would cupcakes push HIE fanfics?
Not the most grimdark
cupcakes was funny
dem puns lol
male_writer: i read cupcakes just a while ago. stayed away from the hype. now that i read it, i have to say, it's not even good...
male_writer: actually i don't get why people do HIE at all... <- It's usually for self gratification and wish fulfillment, I'm sure. Sure some do it nice but it usually always comes down to gettin' with the ponies instead of seeing the scenario without romance.
The video Cupcakes though is scary.
Phase4: XD
Wait, are you saying that there pony/human ships in HIE fics? Impossible!
i <3 cupcakes HD
u better get ready to die:3
DoctoDoctorWho: naah that ain't possible
Phase4: LOL
cachi01: cupcakes 4D. now with real time knifes and blood
Bronies would never do that >_><_<
Eli: i would watch that lol
However, there is a pony video that I love
The Ponies Anthology II
male_writer: Saber?
ah ok. thought saber made those.
haven't seen it yet
oh, you haven't seen The Ponies Anthology II Eli?
male_writer: Meh, I liked first one more
Has anypony seen my own latest fic?
iirc saberspark is the one who made the anthologies
enope. I love reading. not much into that stuff
I've read it DoctoDoctorWho
Blueblood isn't really a jerk
DerpyMuffins: :)
08,01afternoon all
/me 08,01is watching Fiddler on the Roof
DerpyMuffins thank you for telling me about fimfiction, I never knew there was sight for it to be honest.
DerpyMuffins: Actually I've posted a new one. I think it's really good.
08,01fimfiction is great
I know right!
Fimfiction is fixed
Well, I am going to add it to my favorites just like i did with fanfiction
That person needs to update their shit!
Foal in the basket?
YES
Hey there!
That one was good.
hi Uboa-San :)
Uboa-San: UBOAAAAAA!!!
iirc the last thing i read was a clopfic
Ohai Uboa-San :)
mfw uboa :O
yfw u
That one was pretty good, but the idea is a little cliche at face value.
What's something that is most memorable? Mine is Majora's Mask's Stone Tower Temple,
I think After that fateful night did it best
Well, the "A Dragon's Tale" is real good, it is about Spike trying to leave Ponyville so he won't hurt Twilight or any of the other ponies, but guess what?
There is going to be a war for him
Twilight and the others are going to fight for him to stay in Ponyville
male_writer: meh
*sigh* Well, Ill be right back. brb
male_writer Check my stuff out!
i think i just came up with an excellent fic idea!
its called the ugly pony
Fim MadSurge
long time ago, there was an ugly pony
oh, like the ugly duckling in a way?
male_writer:
well... I finally bought... err... Preordered it...
it was so ugly
Holla everypony! :)
oh dear.. No!
that everyone died
Heya GilDash! :)

male_writer: especially check his "It's the thought that counts" some quality work there
Hai GilDash

BarbetosMyBananas: Yeah. You see video editing software there?
Yes
Well..
Welcome back male_writer1215 ^-^
It looks like its for photos
There was a really shitty story about this
Thank you MLP_Brovakiin
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Window To Equestria - 3D Ponies Everywhere
BarbetosMyBananas: wat
One day we saw this and the price was 270000 rubles (about 9000 bucks)
Those idiots just added two extra zeros!
Imagine amount of bricks we shit when we saw this
brb gonna do uboa event
uboa?
Yes.
... damnit why am I so attracted to old Synth latly :(
Uboa-San whats the Uboa event?
Uboa-San: Uboa event? Like having a little crazy girl and screaming UBOAAAAAA! ?
Lil_B: you have steam right?
Eli yes...
Lil_B: would you join us in an epic adventure of castle crashers?
Eli would have to buy and download it first
eh
it's like 200 mb
downloads in seconds
that would be abou 10 min for me, maybe 20 min... I haver 1MB per 3 Seconds on max
Lil_B: It's in the game Yume Nikki, In Poniko's Room in the Pink sea, If you turn off the lights. There will be a 1/64 Chance that the Uboa Event will Occur, Poniko will be replaced by Uboa and an Distorted AAAAAAAAAAAAA Is played, if you touch uboa you will be teleported to a Place, The background shows some creature, Bleeding. The only way to escape is to Pinch Madotsuki Awake or by using the Medamaude Effect.
Got the Uboa Event going!
UBOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Lil_B: well the other guy i'm playing with will be online in 20 min. so that's just fine :)
Uboa-San: Yeah. I thought so. The same good old Uboa event.
Oh, and you cant escape the room if you do the Uboa Effect. Using the light switch only causes another Flash of Light
Eli I looked at it and... I don't really want to pay 4 € for a Game I may only play once or twice :(
Lil_B: that's cool. so i'm gonna gift it to ya
Lil_B: 4 euro?
Lil_B: do it.its an awesome game
JunkerKun 4 Euro and 9 Cents
cachi01: yeah it's down on 4 atm. totall worth it
In the room where the creature is bleeding, Uboa's face is Distorted
Lil_B: Only 2 and half here D=
JunkerKun 2 and a half what?... in which country?
Lil_B: so are yo gonna buy it, or do i have to send it to you?
Lil_B: Russia. It costs 101 rubles here which roughly equals 2 and half euros
Eli that's a tricky question, I don't wanna waste my money, but I don't wanna waste yours eather :/
I don't mind either way. haven't done any "random acts of generosity" in a while.
JunkerKun dat strange Oo
Lil_B: so i'm just gonna send it to you
Lil_B: Nothing strange. Every game is cheaper in Russia, since they adapted cost
Eli wait just one second
ookay
it's cheaper for me too atm. strong swiss francs
Eli I would like to trade it than against one of my spare games :P
Eli I can give you Portal or any Half life 2 game
Lil_B: portal 1?
... I even have a giftable copy of TF2
Eli yes
Lil_B: i was just about to buy that :)
well, goinna trade it than :P
Lil_B.
Lil_B: coool thanks!
Panda what?
/me hugs Panda
Heya Panda! :)
We need you on our home plannet, Lil_B. You are the only one who can save us.
Panda what?!
Kidding, wondering if you are busy is all.
I just had some one come in trying to buy a keylogger <<
woooho. good trade
"Its just so I can keep track of everything on my computer."
Yeah right.
BarbetosMyBananas: Nah, he seems totally legit.
BarbetosMyBananas, I keylogged my computer before. So I could figure out who was using it.
Panda not really busy, for the next 20 mins
Lil_B! Panda! :3
Panda: and then we're gonna have an epic adventure of Castles and Crashes
Lil_B, I see. ^^ What time is it there anyhow?
Panda: it's 5pm
Panda 17:13 in middle Europe
BarbetosMyBananas, its also a good way to catch gf's in lies. >.>
ERli it won't show up in my library
Panda lawl
wut?
yeah
Lil_B, damn. Are you and Reikim on at the same time ever?
Lil_B: you have to check your inventory and use it..
Disregard timezones; acquire caffeine.
Someone, take those DOTA2 gifts away from me T____T
Eli derp
GilDash, you don't drink coffee.
Panda I don't know in whcvih >Timezone Reikim is :/
Panda: There's more to caffeine than just coffee.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAFjgpuWREM
like coke... or diet coke... or coke zero...
Caffeine's in chocolate, after all.
Lil_B, he is an hour ahead of me iirc.
or likem one of my classmates, carry a suspicous looking plastic bag with white powder around... I know it's just cafeeine, but damn it looks suspicous xD

Hmm... we've not had a terrorist drill yet... I wonder when we'll get one.

00,10so I informed them I am puting it down as overtime and they can pay it or else.
00,10oh and best part of all it was 30f this morning.
At the last Fire-evac drill at our school we found out that the tape messege was wrong... we had to evac the elevators, but we have no elevators in our school
Boss of the year right there Sumica
/me hugs Lil_B "Hi" :)
We had a fire evac drill and one of our fire marshalls slipped on the ice outside... in front of where everyone had assembled. XD
00,10I blame security
I blame society.
Someone better blame Saxy.
/me pokes chat
So, my new PC will cost around 1200€ a bit less, but I put away the SSD and the Audio Card, and I'll use the Card reader and CDRom-.Drive from my old PC

DerpyMuffins: That's okay. Sumica gave his boss an icy stare back, so they're all good.
I can go and sit in the corner if it was that bad.
GilDash what killed the Dinosaurs? THE ICE AGE!
00,10I keep saying my bos has nothing to do with it
Lil_B: It doesn't cound if it doesn't apply to Sumica. Situational 'comedy', learn it. XD
00,10security handles shit like that
Sumica: Just put in a word with your boss to freeze their pay.
GilDash I know, I was fully aqware of it that my joke had nothing to do with anytrhing :P
Lil_B: Well, it at least made reference to the cold. :p
Very chilling.
I thought it was a cool Idea
It was a touch frosty.
I think you both are on thin ice.
owww I ce what you did there
Let's not snowball these ideas.
/me looks around for a marker to wring ban on a brick
My internet seems to be a little flakey.
Want to help me build an igloo, Sumica?
man Sumica ... thats justr cold...
/me puts on a coat.
guys i have a question about amazon. hyrule historia cost 19 dollars. is that its preorder priceand i will have to pay the other 15 dollars later?
00,10meh baning you all is too much work.
Maybe I should turn up the heating?
00,10this is easyer
00,10and hear they said it gets louder when it's cold
/nick GilDash
xD
Morning guys. The heckwas that all about?
I used colours? :S
cachi01 normaly, preordering on amazon means this
00,10the script checks for many things.
00,10but only says color
00,10and dont know why you triggered it
Oh~ GilDash was doing something scandalous~
cachi01 you have to pay the price once it's ready to ship
Lil_B: oh thx.cause it says ''save 15 dollars''
Stupid HexChat...
Mirc is best pony, GilDash.
cachi01 I have no Idea where or why, probably not realeated to the Product :/
Can't be arsed changing now.
05also Sumica i managed to enable the kick script to include le lenny faic
hi J_E_Smith71
hello
le lenny faic?
hello DaringDerpy amd J_E_Smith71 !
00,10the face thing
What face thing?
00,10and yeah wrek it's rather easy
Lil_B: and it says list price: 34.99 crossed and then price 19.99
00,10google it
cachi01 can I have a screenshot?
00,10so hows wreky doing?
Lil_B: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1616550414/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?ie=UTF8&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER
Oh, the lenny face. XD
05Sumica: not quite, the ( ) aspects fucked the script up
05but i solved it
so Le lenny face is now bannable excuse?
05and im doing fine
05dinner soon
05hopign to get shit done afterwards
I don't get it.
Why is that face bad?
05been playing new vegas DLS all day :|
idk
05DLC'
05cause it gets spammy
'Cause it's spammed to shit, apparently.
Hm... never seen it before.
00,10https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d512aHu0MfY
It's a 4Chan thing. That might be why.
its used for spam
You got banned on 4chan for using it. That was a while back though.
(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ what about that?
cachi01 ahjhh... it just means that the price dropped from the original 34.99 to 19.43
yay cheaper stuff
Ninjazz: Yeah, but you get banned for anything on 4Chan that's new and is spammed around for a while.
00,10wrek we need to try that with the sundy and gal
00,10at least till AMS Gals are in game
05screw that
Lil_B: yeah i already know that but i was just wondering if i had to pay the rest >.>
cachi01 the free shipping thing is (as far as I know) just that , if the Stuff you ordered is over 25$, than shipping is free
GilDash, that's just /b/ being random.
05imagine placing a sundy up in the midsection of a techplant
cachi01 nope xD
00,10no the video I linked
05practically invonurable
00,10aye
Lil_B: oh cool :D
00,10I know just the place to load a sundy on to a gal too
Yo!
Ninjazz: It's the internet. If it's not random, something's wrong.

08,01DerpyMuffins: come now, it can't be K
Dayum
08,01because physics
I know
It's 2012 and you don't measure temperature in K?
K is absulote zero
it's only -4 here but it's alot of snow coming down right now, and lots of wind too
Oh puh-lease.
oh boy
05hoping for pissa for dinner
08,01well, it's physically impossible to have a negative K temperature
It's not going to be -30 in Kelvin, is it? XD
when that air comes down here we're gonna have fun
05im gettign an xtra large kebab pizza
05if i do
Darn i'm hungry

I don't mind cold as long as there is no wind.

what did you get?
I got a derpy hoody and a Rarity"It is On" shirt
I have not wanted anything particular, so yeah.
nice
hehe nice:P Didn't get any pony swag, but got what I wanted too. The James Bond 50 years box set
And A Brony Wallet along with an Xbox 360 controller that can be used on Xbox and PC with reprogrammable buttons
http://i.imgur.com/FiWz7.gif
xD
50 years o.O
yeah, all the bond movies on blu ray in 1 box, with an open slot for skyfall when that comes out
http://i.imgur.com/VBnY0.jpg
I would Watch it.
:O
Skyfall isn't really a Bond film
too bad i don't own a Blu ray player
DerpyMuffins: why?
No gadgets
Whatsoever
Just a car and gun
yeah, I was a bit dissapointed about that too
but I really liked some other parts of it tho, like the car and his background story. Not gonna spoil anything for those who haven't watched it yet
I actually liked that about Skyfall. All the gadgets were getting boring.
but the only kind of gadget in this was... a tiny radio:P

I just realized something about John Joseco.
And it has nothing to do with ponies.
both his names begin with a 'J' :O
In the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure series, each JoJo is called as such because their names can be shortened to "JoJo".
grr if no morepeople come into work i'm going to start watching Adventure Time

pretty sure its not a maid outfit
00,10not goth no.
ohai Sumica
No, Nittany is the one who wears a maid outfit.
It's not a maid outfit. Who would wear a maid outfit at the beach.
Specifically, we were discussing why your OC is female.
Aaaah that clears it up.

oh, right, that was nittany

HAO A YUU
I've just been replaying Vinyl's lullaby for close to an hour now
FAIN, SANK YOU.
I AM GUUUDZZ
Panda Wut? :D

/me back to darker than black
Kipkat07_Scarf, I mean.
Panda: de'whaaaaaaaaaaaa
Kipkat07_Scarf, horrible experience when I was 5. Nothing to talk about.
AH WEESH AI WUH A BARHD.
I knew someone at primary school who had a phobia of horses and ponies. We had to go on a field trip that involved walking through a field of them. He wasn't happy. XD
Panda: ah. I see.
00,10I had a bad encounter with a horse as a kid, I still like them
Sumica: ok, we only burn down the swedish king's house
WHUT DIID U SEEEEED
GilDash: :O
:o
Sumica it didnt try to give you that Hands disease or whatever it is called.
00,10I had maple surip on my shirt from breakfast.
yay
00,10horse could smell it and tryed to eat said shirt while I was still earing it
The JoJo's Bizarre Adventure anime is on hiatus this week. >:I
00,10wearing*
Fucking new year.
did it succeed?
Sumica: sounds... wait, huh?
:D
00,10no it failed but it did fream me right the hell out at the time
I don't like cold hands :I
my mom thinks I dont know how to use the touchpad on my computer because I prefer using my wireless mouse and cant understand why I prefer using a mouse. >_<
MUM, Y U NO UNDERSTAND LAPTOPS
hi there
It's just preference and feel maybe
Kipkat07_Scarf, this is because parents have an intellegence so high that they cannot comprehend simplicity.
ohai
she prefers to work with the touchpad?
Panda: ex-fucking-actly except for the high part. I constantly teach her stuff about politics, history, computers, science, logic, etc.
/me glomps AttackWithHugs "Ohai" ^_^
DaringDerpy: I believe so..
Kipkat07_Scarf, t'was sarcasm.
I've been spotted! :O
/me failed.
AttackWithHugs: that you have ^_^
I must go to Skyrim to avenge this failure
A horse bit me into the finger when I was a kid. Tried to feed it with a carrot. These beasts have huge teeth. But it made no damage, didn't break the skin. I didn't even scream at it, but it looked to guilty and unhappy. :(
00,10My fave is the parent asking you to come look at something on laptop.
I prefer having something in my hands to draw with. My stylus designed for ipad works on computer screen as well as laptop touchpads.
-to +so
00,10cause you know they could not have just broughtit to you
Sumica: I love that
Sumica: exactly why I dont let my mom use mine.
Sumica, I am glad I am like Scootaloo; no parents.
For that very reason.
Well, other reasons as well.
/me gets into his C-130 and flies away to Skyrim
byeeeeeeee
00,10I like my parents but yeah I am glad dad is a technophobe.
00,10cause mom hears things and gets all freaked out
My parents are getting worse. they call me from upstairs from their cell phone to the downstairs house phone to have me do stuff for them or ask me something.
08,01scootaloo has parents
08,01AJ doesn't
scootaloo sleeps in the treehouse
08,01Kipkat07_Scarf: pfft, C-130? what you need is an E-3
00,10such as the thing a few months back where the FBi was turning off the DNS they had set up to counter act the effects of a long dead virus
HELLO!
00,10so mom calls me up freaking out that she wound have internet any more cause the FBI is turning it off

08,01DaringDerpy: that first pic of scoots sleeping in the clubhouse reminded me of this (really fucking sad) fanfic: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/10/story-final-dream-of-filly.html

08,01i have no idea
I'll have to remmeber the name. Can't read these at work.

So sew buttons and be a tailor!

In fact, I dont see Rarity there at all.
Blasphemy.
Lack of Spitfire. Disappoint.
Theres always the other side :)
Spitfire is worst pony >.>
I object stringly to that.
Strongly* you mean?
If you object "stringly," its weak and will blow away in the wind.
Strawberry Cheesecake is possibly the best thing ever invented :)
Disregard Panda; aqcuire Spitfire.

Panda: I blame Sweetie Bell. She's being a useless dictionary today.

can't read this fanfic without dictionary. too much advanced vocabulary

total drama island was ok, but the rest of em were not neccesary
/me Pulls BroPony|PYRO into the chat
NO TURNING BACK NOW
Total Drama went downhill after season two.

yes it did, unfortunately....
I'll never forget the episode where Heather loses her top though.
it had more seasons then 1?
:D
yeah :(
Harold: "Booyah..."
lucky we
total drama world tour was great
here only season 1 aired

You know what show needs to be good again?
SpongeBob.

just
...no
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Pony Comic Variants at Hot Topic
I have a new favorite show (besides My litle Pony) Dan Vs.
The new seasons from season six onward have been awful.
Season five had its moments.
i've only seen 3 minutes of Dan Vs. is it good?
have there been more than 5?
lawl
you know what has to get better?
But you just can't beat SpongeBob seasons 1-4.
Dutch voice acting.
Yes I find it freaking Hilarious
There have been nine seasons of SpongeBob so far.
IT IS TERRIBLE
Seasons six-nine of SpongeBob have been awful, though.
Can't be as bad as current swedish voice acting. =(
you do not want to hear ANY good show in dutch voice overs
or Movie
The last "awesome" SpongeBob episode was the one where Krabs retired and the Krusty Krab was reformatted into the Krabby O'Mondays.
that is just terrible
Hey, the SpongeBob movie fucking owned.
^
Agreed
yeah same here
Three words.
GOOFY.
GOOBER.
ROCK.

Snow: it just can't be worse than latin spanish...

OR dutch germans
or belgium people

hai Lyra_Heartstrings
kkk
o/
ive seen all these pictures about 10 ten times now
its the offline online
why does my phone vibrate for no reason?
umm offline slideshow :p
the two shooting stars as AJ's parents was a really nice touch in the last ep imo
that brings up a question though
applebloom? :)
And then when she see's me she'll have never seen me before and if she's never seen me before that means she'll assume I dont have any friends and if I dont have any friends that means I'm sooo lonely and that'll make her sad so she'll go and throw a secret surprise party just for me and introduce me to everypony in ponyville!
And then I'll have lots and lots of friends!
Ryunosuke: what about her?
i wonder if that pony eating bacon pic represents BaconMane
well all of it
Because the phone wants to go in no mans land
That or she call's the royal gaurd, either or.
Lyra_Heartstrings: it is
MLP in CrYENGINE 3: http://www.crydev.net/viewtopic.php?f=311&p=1094147#p1094147
That eye thing chasing SB64, does that remind anypony of Hermaus Mora?
i think that the pony drawing a dragon represents Wrek
reminds me of a pokemon :)
it is :)
i wonder who that green haired pony is
Any bronies here?
nice
I wonder...
Oh luna, y u so beutiful?
yup
Looks pretty good though
more of those to come soon
Why is rainbow dash glowing?
And what's all that stuff floating in the air?
green hair, in a maid type outfit?
lol
I might make a 3d flash movie like that
yeah
I wished someone happy birthday right here: http://www.crydev.net/viewtopic.php?f=126&t=103600
So is it an actual game or just a movie?
Baconmane, Phase, Superbrony, Wrek, Sumica, Shizuka, Vivi, Ghosties, Val, Luna
I think thats phase
movie
I uploaded the new sparx version, so you can try it - its on spyroforum (download link on the 1st page), dont forget to give me some feedback tomorrow (here or on the forums), bc I'm going to sleep right now

Lil_B: tell me about it... if i don't start writing soon, i'll get ripped apart
we told him all the wrong genders for everyone

Until SR
He started getting suspicious
haha

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whl91kKmu5w
ugh
everyone can know my name
I put it in somewhere when I set up kvirc
it really pisses me off how they put their heart and soul into making a song for a one time character(cadance) but then 1/8th their asses for applejacks song T~T
Afflict's name is Joseph Bossio :p
1 2 3 4
Well now you have to tell us your full name
I like Octavius reskin
since you have no trouble giving out someone else's
Octavia's
My real name is...
Marty Mcfly

I forgot the song already
taoumi: yea, but they fucking half assed it
XD
lol yeah they did
and put their heart and souls into one time characters songs
even ask dari
like flim flam or cadance
god i hate the studio
08,01is what me?
lol
A picture.
http://i.imgur.com/CsVAL.jpg
crystal songs were...um not needed at all. they should jsut not have put them in
08,01ah, no, that's otakon
hello String_Shredder and SafariMonkey
08,01also, who made that?
08,01because that is very mean
I don't know. One of the regulars.
Hey Lil_B
:P
Tab fail?
taoumi: yea, again, put their heart and soul into songs that are meant for shite characters, yet make sure the songs for already established ones suck
/me hugs SafariMonkey
/me hugs Lil_B back :3
08,01racist barn was an uncalled for song
Maybe they plan on making more with Apple Jack?
08,01i don't know why it was in there
08,01it didn't add anything to the episode
08,01i blame hasbro's meddling
Also, this: http://i.imgur.com/ioosZ.png
My phone wants to go to no mans land again
right Sarurn? it was so racist
The first and last of Applejack songs
finally got around getting Metropolis in HD >.< , also just bought the Humble Bundle 7, I wanna play Closure, I heard that game makes you feel very uncomfortable
08,01it sounded like a song that was just there to fill up a soundtrack CD
08,01to appeal to younger viewers
I hope Hasbro releases the Episode earlier again so I may download it before it airs, I wanna have the episode when the meetup starts
hahahaahaahahhahaaahahahahaahha
does anyone here play magic the gathering?
who hates what?
I'm still listening to the cuti mark crudaers song :P
00,02yeah, the song kinda came out of nowhere and stole some episode time
wut
wut
haha
08,01Bronysith: not sure if you're joking or if you actually believe that
http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/173/576/Wat8.jpg?1315930535
It was an excuse to finally give her a song, that's it
it's funny
because I was going to say "wat"
but for some reason I said "wut" instead
Bronysith: they aren't all like you
lol
08,01Bronysith: okay, that just doesn't make sense from just about every perspective i can think of
00,02^
Bronysith: hating everything, i mean
Eli: i dont hate everything
but honestly, a song appearing out of nowhere to steal episode time... I felt like this with both songs in the Premiere too... well, one reason I didn't like the S3 Primere anywhere :/
wut
08,01i know one thing Bronysith loves
:O
http://cheezburger.com/6920229888 speaking of AppleJack
Bronysith: sure sounds like it though... everytime i'm on at the same time as you are, you're just hating on something else. why not apreciate the good things?
he likes to take people to bed
like Tommy Wiseau likes to "let's go home"
[Alpha]: you do realize that there was another season 3 letter right?
I didn't make this
08,01XAX: awesome
[Alpha]: i know, but whoever did was so wrong
08,01seaosn 3 letter?
08,01oh right
08,01friendship letter
Happens a lot on that website
[Alpha]: cause that website sucks
00,02i don't know why people bother buying cooking oils
00,02just buy a bunch of bacon and cook things in the fat
Phase4: hi
Applejack's letter is just a bunch of curly lines. Illiterate peasant!
00,02it makes for REALLLY delecious bacon
Phase4: ... that is genius
That is very unhealthy Phase4
laugh
00,02DerpyMuffins, why?
08,01in my headcanon, celestia gets a lettergasm every time she receives one from twilight and her friends
To cook everything in bacon fat?
what I found funny about Win8 is, that the VLC Player Team made a Kickstarter to raise money for the development of the Win8 Version of the VLC Player, while
00,02not everything, just things you'd use olive oil for otherwise
00,02Lil_B, they made a kickstarter?
while Microsoft didn't include the Media Player in the basic Version of Win8 because "people can just use the VLC Player instead"
Phase4 yes, just a sec
Phase4: like rescuing squirrels that got stuck in drain pipes?
00,02wait
http://cheezburger.com/6912533504
08,01Phase4: bacon fat is worse for you than olive oil
00,02they DIDNT in include a media player
Phase4: though, olive oil is plant oil, not animal fat. it's healthier
I like this one
08,01it contains more saturated fats
08,01true
08,01very true
08,01hey Phase4, what do you look like?
08,01i just realised i have no idea
00,02plus it's cheeper than oil
He is an Albino

Phase4 yeah, I just checked it, some Win8 Version don't come with the Media Player installed... the one thing the generall Dum,b User who doesn't know much about PCs liked about Windows is, that you could just put in a CD or DVD, and it would play what's on it :/

Bronysith: i'm not complaining. It sucks, but i can't do anything about it, so why complain?

You were on spyrochat once and we told you all the wrong genders

"They aren't playing worms right?" so nerdy xD
I remember that
lol
oh that
I think that are Pictures of Till Schweiger
Lil_B: they are
Candy and soda
Not the most filling of dinners
But I love it.
Eli looks like the Black Mesa Sign
Ok, the Movie Titles were managable, but these ones are too extreme for me
Lil_B: tehy are nerdy. at least i know the Ark of the Covenant...
Bundeslade is way better of a word xD
"is a way better word" - fixd
I mix both
goooood it's not jakie chan
how do they not recognize Bruce Lee?
Hi
Eli ikr xD
What's up?
picture of Bruce Lee "Is that Jakie Chan?" -.(\
I think the most nerdy thing about this is that they are having this at 1:30am...
Lil_B: true
Lil_B: that harry potter music in the back
Eli and Darth Vader Theme...
Lil_B: it is sooo german... srly? Bohlen and Bernd?
Eli Bohlen sucks, Bernd is AMAZING
Eli Bernd is just awesome : D eine Kultfigur
Lil_B: i know right? I sometimes hit KIKA on at 1 am and watch it for hours
Eli yeah, used to do that too : ) I hope they will finally show his New-Years speech again
that would be epic. i'll watch out for it
Eli if not, youtube
yep
my best friend is over at my plaace for silvester, and he loves him too :)
ein Ess-cape... epic
Eli "Generally we can say, that the coming year will not be better than the previous one, it can only get worse and it will, therefore, I highly reccomend you get yourself a shovel, dig a hole, and sit in it... a very deep hole" I mean... KIDS TV for Kids under 12 years! xD
Lil_B: he always brings epic stuff like that
08,01this is fun
mmm... ok, need to PM that...
/me 08,01snugs the blanket
Lil_B: srly, he should get translated and brought on the hub
But perfect for 18-30 year old people xD... cxue it just after MLP
Lil_B: probably... but we love our little depressed bi-polar Bernd
yeah :)
I actually got a Present for someone in the UK, a copy of "Dinner for one" I heard it never ever aired in the UK
Lil_B: really? can't imagine that. we watch it every year
Eli well, british comedy made in germany... seriously, all the people you here laughing in that Scetch are german
i haven't sat with my family to watch it for years tho... don't even know if they have an accent anymore

Eli yeah... I think Mime would be the right word
Lil_B: welp. english is hard sometimes.
Lil_B: and i'm not being sarcastic here
08,01english is a bitch of a language
08,01Dutch is quite easy
08,01German is moderately hard
08,01i love German poetry
Eli yeah :/
08,01Punkie_Pue: english
08,01i'm from Scotland
I heard Russion is rather hard, and the most hard language to learn would be icelandic
My english teacher is from scottland
Do you know any other languages?
08,01German and a bit of Dutch
08,01but i'm not as fluent in German as i used to be
08,01and even then, i wasn't all that fluent in it
08,01but i could get by
The reason I ask is I have entertained the idea of learning german.
08,01Punkie_Pue: doo eeet!
08,01Eli: i might try and skype you and Lil_B
Punkie_Pue: it's not really worth it, in my opinion. but go on
I was thinking the same, not being worth it.
08,01Bronysith: you know german?
Bronysith: do you speak german?

I just rewatched Hearts and Hooves Day. SHMOOPY-DOO!
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: Building Bridges / A Day in the Candy Clouds
sorry, but Bronystate died for me :/
What, are we supposed to be streaming?
bornisteit is ded for Lil_B, ded!
Big Mac needs to stop breaking all da mare's hearts
Lil_B: what why?
Eli don't know, the site went white and wouldn#t load

Waiting for the ratings for last week's Toonami broadcast to come out.

I tried taking Japanese but it was a bit too much for me to handle
no I <3 Bronystate, the Website just kinda died for a secondf in front of me :/
08,01hey Lil_B, i might be coming to germany in a few weeks
*looks into Lil_Bs eyes while jazz music playes*
08,01where in germany do you live, and can i come viist?
08,01Lil_B: ilmenau first, then up north somewhere
Rex_Mundi oh my...
08,01Eli: you just want me in your bed! :P
08,01(which i'm totally amenable to)
Lil_B: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU7grL_HBMM
ಠ_ಠ
Rex_Mundi GEMA
08,01Lil_B: about an hour out from Jena, in Thüringia
Might see if I can get my forgein lanugauge course waived
Just found out Terry Cavanagh lives in my home town :O I must find him!
08,01Socks: who is that?
Yeah, who is that?
08,01Lil_B: well, i'm willing to travel anywhere
???
good evening :)
Good evening Bogy :)
08,01Socks: i have no idea what that is
Ohai Socks :)
Great indie game, won some awards.
hey bronies I'm watching The Avengers on dvd with my brother, father and my other bros mordo and rigs! WAZZZUP?!
Ohai MLP_Brovakiin :)
so.. when is the next stream? or other ways... will there be a other stream until friday night and when?^^
kidzrul732 Who is this and why is he acting five?
The avengers is a movie
But I thought it was cool
Bogy: It's random when there are streams outside the scheduled ones
okay :)
kidzrul732 I know that, dingus. I wanna know why you're acting like a five-year-old.
I'm not I'm just hanging out
My beer list is getting very long :D so many brews to try, so little time :)
You came in here with a ton of bad grammar and a random blurb of something that had no relation to what we were talking about.
08,01Socks: ARE YOU KIDDING?
... I sense a Browser-derp coming up again...
08,01i'd LOVE to meet stephen hasking!
/me puts on Socks
08,01he's just the most amazing man!
And you topped it off with WAZZUP.
08,01*hawking
SafariMonkey: he really is
:P
08,01he's... i don't even know, i think i'd explode if i met him
08,01he's one of my all-time heroes
That's the kind of thing I associate with 12-year-old AOL users.
Once I've had enough of Texas's micro brews, I'll tour the other 49 states, and the THE WORLD!
The avengers KICKS ASS!
Tab fail, Eli? :P
No offense if you are.
Come to Cambridge, I think he still lives here.
Probably :/
08,01he does; i think he still lectures at cambridge
I agree that The Avengers is a fantastic film. But you're going about talking about it the wrong way.
SafariMonkey: yeperl
:3 I'm such an alchy :D
Probably, I don't check :P
08,01Cypresswolf: waht'd you drink?
SafariMonkey: i tabfail at least once a day or i don't feel good
All the best people are from Cambridge
08,01Cypresswolf: also, i can guarantee i'm worse
whatever, I'm just gonna keep watching the movie
08,01or, at least, i was at one point
I love that we have at least three different conversations happening at the exact same time. :P
^ See?
08,01well... prince william went to my uni.
08,01harumph.
XD
Lately - Johnny Walker, Budweiser, Smirnoff, Margarita, Gentleman Jack, and ... what did I have at the Texans game...Crown Royal and something 7
Prince William is duke of my town :P
My Cousin's Cousin had dinner with him :P
08,01SafariMonkey: aye, also a shame about black holes
Teri Hatcher is my second cousin and I met the mailman from Mister Rogers' Neighborhood once. :/
my Idea is, Light maybe is the fastest thing in the Universe, but it's speed should not be statest as the speed Limit of the Universe, according to e=mc² it would ben that , if there would be something that has less mass than a quantum of light, it woul be faster than Light
All that since sunday
08,01Eli: aye; einstein did really poorly at school
light has no mass
I don't really know anybody, I happen to live in a place where awesome people live.
08,01GabeMoist: but it does have momentum
bull*
Eli: He wasn't that interested though
the only standout on that list is the Johnny Walker
08,01Eli: one of his teachers called him a "lazy dog" in his report card
08,01SafariMonkey: i've not, actually
note: i hate our school system
08,01Eli: ah, okay
There's still some Cider brews in the liqour store I've been wanting to try - and next moth - Saki :)
too*
08,01Eli: i have very slight dyslexia, but mostly i have ADHD and PDA
Anyone have Dispraxia?
Coz I do :(
Sad tings
Considering I almost chopped half my finger off, and I have half a month work, I guess I finally have time from Bronystate. :"3
08,01Lil_B: well, technically it doesn't have mass, but it has energy, is affected by gravity, and has momentum
There's got to be a brew of the week for each year - must look that up - If I don't find it, Patent Pending!
08,01Socks: my brother has really bad dyspraxia
08,01he literally writes like a 4 year old
it's 2:17 a.m. and im not tired but bored... do a stream! xD
AW, sb64
08,01Socks: i'd give you a dyspraxic high five, buyt we'd both miss and fall off our chairs
Goodnight everyone! :)
XD
Bye MLP_Brovakiin
Eli: What would you rather talk about? Ponies?
Socks: eh why not. ponies are better than my sad disfunctional life
08,01SafariMonkey: i'm not sure how seriously to take that
Eli: So which pony is best pony?
Socks: Luna of course
:O
Socks: stupid question
08,01Dismo: is your finger okay?
/me huggles fluttershy
Socks: oh you would get along well with a friend of mine
/me 08,01would probably kill himself if he lost any fingers
All my love for Fluttershy :P
flutters fanatics...
08,01life without being able to play the cello anymore wouldn't be worth living.
She is just so cute!
And probably the most likely to kill somepony ¬_¬
But mainly cute :)
evening all
08,01Eli: what'd you do to it?
hello Mr_Kopple
There is no best pony it's all just personal preference
08,01wow, how odd
brb
08,01Cypresswolf: sure!
Food is, biside the language, the most iconic thing a Country has to offer :)
there is a best pony
her name is vivi
08,01Shizuka! i had another dream about you!
08,01and it wasn't dirty!
Shizuka: that's not how you spell Luna
08,01you were in a forest and kept screaming for something and digging, then we were in a mine and you were trying to open a door
sounds like minecraft
If I had to show a guest from anopther country our local food... I don't know... Handkäs mit Musik or a Schnitzel
08,01the door led to this blue room that was somehow also my bedroom, and there was this blue glowing piece of cobalt
don't trust doors
08,01it was the most beautiful colour i'd ever seen
Lil_B: give him Würste
Sounds like a dirty dream. Mines are always filthy, right?
Lil_B: Currywurst
Eli xD Presskopp
08,01Eli: hells yeah currywurst!
Lil_B: uhhh Kartoffelsalat! best german dish ever
Eli Currywurst :P naahhh wi sinn hier nett im Ruhrpot!
08,01SafariMonkey: aye, exactly
Anyway
</rant>
08,01Eli: we get that here too; but the german version is better
Lil_B: Bierbraten? also pretty good
Ah. Kelp. :P
08,01bierbraten, yum
08,01knackwurst
but it also depends where y<ou get it, Kartoffelsalat changes from North to South
08,01Burning|Grey|: what's that?
posibility
/me is back in the clurb so put yo hands urp
or something
and then Flash died, at least it was just a few secs...
08,01i love it when #bronystate is talking about interesting things like tonight
Hey guys, I finally made it back home.
08,01it gives me faith that our userbase hasn't just descended into a bunch of bronysiths
08,01:P
08,01Eli: i love rottkohl and leberkãse on bread
Streams up
Who's streaming?
oooh just cause
his parachute is like Snake's box
Why? Just Cause!
^

So good
PLEASURE
I've got like 98% in this game D:

Dat truck is mlg

08,01and apparently, wrek makes really good negroballs
08,01so i really want to taste his balls.
aniderp|bestcakeever what's with it? I preordered it today :)
you did?
SO TOUCHY

08,01SafariMonkey: ERMERGERD YOU'RE PSYCHIC

well, they are gangs

08,01SafariMonkey: aye

its llike 20 dollar
does serdadu mean waifu in indonesian
08,01negro isn't all that offensive here iether
Yeah
anti-matter matter interactions
08,01is it offensive in the US?
I would like to formally apologize for voting for Assassin's Creed II over this in the Community's Choice sale. If I waited a while and saw this game on the stream, I would've voted for Just Cause 2
this is ula with panao tech support
NEWTON ROLLING IN GRAVE
... Negrto would probably kinda offensive in some peoples twisted minds of our society :/
TAP HIS CORPSE FOR ENERGY
08,01SafariMonkey: really? last i heard "nigger" was *very* offensive
well.
enemies out side of mission area
thats cute
might depend which side of the atlantic you're on
lol
hai guise
We had a Cancellor who opened a speech in Afrika with the words "Ladys and Gentleman, dear Niggers" (in german) Appearently nobody took it as something offensiuve... except the Media of course ...
Lil_B: really? wow
wut
so buggy
Sketch_Toku_Brony was inb the 80's I think
ah i see
ustream is back on
I see we are discussing the magical n-word! :D
necromancy?
:)
jcelios! shame!
NNNBananas?
:( sorry
Nanotechnology?
necromancy is definitely a magical n word
Science is Magic
08,01one of the only words that offends me, pretty much thte only thing that offends me, is the word "paki"
08,01because i was teased using it as a kid
Well, bye everyone, I need to got to bed :)
whats paki?
Night Lil_B
cya Lil_B
RoboGerbil: A derogitory term used against those of eastern origin, mainly used in the uk... I believe
I always thought it was just short for pakistanie
Not for use in public, it's a word with a history
Like Gollywog, It is a word that needs to vanish.
Who here has seen BoonDocks?
may Princess Luna guide you through the world of elated dreams Lil_B
Not good :(
discord approves of this game's scoring system
^
what is ging on and what is this game?
Stuff
snowden: discussing racial terms, just casue 2
I'm going to go check for the weekly spoiler. brb. :)
An aweful lot of awesome stuff
cause*
And no, I'll keep quiet about it
INFINITE AMMOS
/me doesn't even want to know the title of the next ep
racial terms :( bud Just Cause 2 :D
/me would appreciate the shushing
Socks anyone could use the command to make it show up
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAX
You should of not said anything
D:
Surprised no one has done it yet.
Barbetos: dont tempt them
you might want to not stick around here at all if you don't even want to know the title.
Meh, it doesn't matter that much :D
YOU ALMOST HIT FLUTTERSHY! :[
I see the title just before watching it anyways
...
thats about all there is to say
HURHURHUR IT STARTS WITH A LETTER BETWEEN A AND Z
SNAPE KILLS CELESTIA
AND THE PHYREXIANS INVADE
Spoiler alert snape kills trinity with rosebud
wait... I thought Snape was luna's father?
applejack is really a pegasus
08,01SafariMonkey: yeah, it was
nullradix: she is, and luna is celestias daughter...
adasdad: do you play magic on steam too?
Bronysith, I don't like the double standards that go on in my country either. All I can do is try to deal with my own and call out other people who are using it without shame.
08,01as i say, the only reason it was is because it was a word that i associate with my own experiences of being bullied as a kid
whos playin', btw?
eli: nope :\
Snowden, Shizuka
coolio
adasdad: aww... you should get it it's cheaper atm
Y SO MUCH HAX
infinite ammo rpg op nerf pls
WHA-poom
The whole N words privilege is a blatant double standard. Either non-black people should be allowed to say it, or nobody.
Just Cause 2 is like a game where all the hax are turned on at the start
Kandarihu: Don't go there, just saying.
^
Please :'(
Tis' be sensitive territory
No one will come out of it looking good
also, *ride of the valkeries*
for some reason, the map reminds me of bionicle
^
All dem km
jcelios: XD
LOGIC
Socks, I almost never come out of ANYTHING looking good.
one might say its a... Bye-plane
08,01i was mostly bullied in primary school for being indian
*flight of the bumblebee*
tuk tuk boom lol
tuktuk boom ius best vehicle
oh.. i got banned from 4chan for 3 days...... :D
08,01but i was bullied when i was in boarding school for a year (secondary) for being Scottish ( i was in an english school)
lol wut
Once I went up as high as you could go in this game, jumped out of the helicoptor, got back in, started up the engine and flew away and it was well epic :P
lol
NICE
dat ai
?
damn literates!
08,01Bronysith: :(
Did your reading material also get stabbed?
08,01people are stupid
^^^^
^
SO MUCH ^^^^^
08,01Socks: i loved being in a boarding school, mostly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Sunday, Sunday, Sunday!
Socks: boarding schools are great
08,01i'm a very independent person, and being in a boardin school when i was 14 was the first time i could really explore that
People are stupid? Or inteligent enough to make it hurt? The brain?
08,01well, 13/14
shit happens...I got bullied on an island because I was born on the continent...and on the continent I was considered "weird" because I had lived all my life on said island. fml
goddamn i hated middle school t~T
/me didn't mean to force his views about boarding schools on anyone else, I am very sorry.
bronysith: with what?
It was in Year 6 that kids suddenly became a jerk to me.
I don't like the idea of not being able to get out of a boarding school. Feeling trapped in, scares me :(
08,01SafariMonkey: wow, why wer eyou there?
i spent school years k-3 in a k-12 school overseas learning new words
sup Phase4
ohai Uakh
00,10bleh, so tired
long time no see :D
/me glomps Phase4 into Sumica
hi sumica
Phase4: So, you're a mod now.
08,01SafariMonkey: i do not, no
/me sits on Sumica's head
GOTTA GO FAST
Socks, i'm a mod now :P
walking around at the speed of DIAGNOL
Phase4: Nice one :) COngratulatibitorianies or some such
/me ponies 47 on head's sumica
"well i got stabbed in the arm for reading" Don't you dare fucking read on my turf again. Don't fuck with the Reading Rainbows, bitch!
String_Shredder: Were you assulted by twilight?
String_Shredder: T~T
SafariMonkey: nice, do you like speak fancy and stuff ?
this is MY book, and I'M GOING TO CUT YOU!
/me suplexes String_Shredder into hot fudge
String_Shredder: fanfic about why rainbow dash was previously afraid of reading?
lol dem doors
:D
silly car, you aren't a bird
I whip my doors back n' forth
00,10just 2 more days of this shift and I am done
was that a typo?
possibry
Phase4: do you think I will actually ever get -b from #geek ? It's getting old you know.
Uakh: Yeah, I'm fluent in fancy (speaking age ~8-12)
Wall-E won the movie A? That was my last week selection
yes he is
Wall-E is actually a good movie, despite the normal stuff being crap.
We're watching Wall-E! nice!
<3 Wall-E
Pixar makes awesome movies.
^
haven't watched wall-e yet
Uakh, i think it was a perm ban, i'll ask if you want
00,10meh, most the actors seemed too robodic
Socks: ill be working, i wont be able to watch high budget animation T~T
when is it again ?
/me suplexes Socks into laundry
Phase4: thx
still don't know why I was banned tbh
firetruck stops for no car
/me stabs Bronysith out of pity
/me heals his wound and raging lions Socks
yay~
Uakh: U was banned :(
Pixar still makes awesome movies, despite the other kids-movie companies surrendering to unfunny potty humor and being unoriginal.
/me dodged
outside of big-K being pissed for having a bad day
/me doesn't like potty humour, tis lazy
Dreamworks has lost every single bit of its goodness over the 15 years.
HTTYD was good...
KrazyNoobs: last good movie was shrek 1
^
Sumica, how is your shift going to affect your streaming of BMN?
Uakh: BTW, by fancy I mean French: I'm using applejack's translation.
How to train your dragon, i would have to admit, was good.
KrazyNoobs: even then they ripped off aladdin
when's Shrek 5 coming out ?
SafariMonkey: I got it
00,10It wont effect BMN
Sumica: *affect
I'm mostly fluent in fancy myself
?
THere's a fifth one T-T
:P
hello everypony
/me huggles Socks "i know that feel"
Uakh: Only Shrek 1 was good, the sequel (2) was not as good, 3 and up were crappy in my opinion.
there making an Enders Game movie
Despicable Me was also pretty damn good.
HTTYD!
Snowden: that book was fucked up beyond belief
How to train your dragon for those who can be bothered to type
KrazyNoobs: i hope 2 gets just as good
KrazyNoobs: hence why I was asking. Bad movies are like a train wreck. Watch The Son of the Mask for instance
is Shizuka streaming
Eli: Nope, Dreamworks always f---s up on sequels.
So what then, Sumica? Will you just have a playlist running automatically?
Bronysith: yes, but i want to see how they transfer it to the movies, cuz, yo know, dead 8 year olds and such
KrazyNoobs: let me hope. if they fuck up HTTYD 2 i'm gonna bomb them
Snowden: Da whut...
00,10no, the shift wont start till almost midnight
HTTYD?
texasboykc09: who else is capable of such carnage? :P
SON OF THE MASK... worst movie ever.
Snowden: "meet ender, an 18 year old who all his life wanted to join the military" problem solved
KrazyNoobs: I have it on DVD ! :D
Snowden: only japan can get away with killing people under the age of 15
Sumica, what shift
Snowden: see, evangelion, and lots of other animes >.>
Sumica: Are you too old for this *pfft* shift :D
Shizuka are we there yet!?
D=
...oh. I totally forgot to factor in that Sumica's in a different time zone from me. :P
Oh I am hilarious
But really, Son Of The Mask has no audience, as it is innapropriate for little kids, and the people who are allowed to watch it will find it annoying and stupid.
Oh god. That place
I alway seem to get stuck there fighting in this game
Bronysith: Ender is played by Asa Butterfield, from Hugo and the Boy in striped pajamas, so i think they are sticking with fairly young
Sumica, will you be here for the new ep.
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Discussion: Have any Ponies Influenced You Personally?
texasboykc09: Sumica streams the new ep.
00,10I personalt wont
or not
00,10but that wont stop me from remote streaming it
Bronysith: true, but i have a little hope
The only bad movie that Pixas has ever made was Toy Story 3.
*Pixar
Toy Story 2 was good for a sequel.
But my fav will always be 1.
of course
00,10but what about toystory 4
u gawt a france in me!
KrazyNoobs: even then toy story 3 is better than any dreamworks movie
00,10the quest for more franchising
KrazyNoobs: Da fuq u sayin'!
KrazyNoobs: really ? I found it enjoyable. I heard the only bad pixar ws actually the-one-with-the-scottish-girl-I-just-can't-remember-the-name-of
Sumica: Are they making that? I haven't seen any commercials, because in Australia, movies are like 6 months behind 'murica.
Brave?
/me cried during toy story 3 TWT
Uakh: brave?
Brave
00,10it's still in development hell
Cars 2 is worst
Yeah. I did not watch it
cars 2 was horrible.
i'm sorry
it was
I never watched cars 2 either.
Brave was a commercial flop wasn't it?
Sumica Duke Nukem Forever?
I should just say that Toy Story 1/2, Monsters Inc., the Incredibles and Wall-E are my favs by Pixar.
No wonder they're doing sequals now :(
Moo
Bronysith: Who knows? Not only is the incident itself bad, but the publicity is even worse. the 26 people who died did not include the wife, then theres Videogames, and god knows what else
Snowden: of course they had to shoehorn in "videogames are bad" bullshit excuse
also, IMDB has confirmed that Toy Story 4 is announced
What else can they do with the series?
Sumi: And hopefully it stays there. Toy Story 3 was a perfect cap to the trilogy. >_>
O shit
It finished
ENDED!
00,10so I have come to the conclusion just cause 2 takes place in the island that tropaco takes place in
Bronysith: appearently he liked Mass Effect 2 days earlier, which *cough* explains everything *cough*
that was AWESOME
Done with it ended really well
I very much dislike when a "big movie" company remakes classics. (ie Alvin and the Chipmunks)
SuperBrony64: moo
Alvin and the Chipmunks? Bleh.
Bronysith: also, the media thought it was his brother for the first week and a half or something
First one was bad enough, why did people go see it enough to merit a sequel? D:<
KrazyNoobs: that's like when a video game company makes a game of a movie...sometimes it's good...sometimes...
ET
Atari
hey does any1 know how the process of corrupting cynder came about?
:[
I like how she glides effortlessly through the trees :D
no
Everyone should buy Just Cause 2.
The HP games were ok
like did they just put her in the beam
ET is taboo
Becuase Just Cause 2 MP is in development
this game is way over the top
And when it finally releases...
E.T, the game. That was the game that ran Atari out of business.
Barbetos: i need to get windows 7 to play just cause 2 T~T
RoboGerbil, over the top? Nevah.
