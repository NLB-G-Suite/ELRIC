00,03"I never thought I would live in a world where Ponies were considered manlier than Vampires"
8,1is it one of those so bad it's good ones?
Listening to the reading isn't bad.
RainbowcrashNBurn: what os?
Phase4: windows 7
unless the reader cries
I read My little Dashie in one sitting (not too long)...not a single manly tear was shed that day
if the reader doesn't cry, they're hardcore
i was no where near manly then
Scoot-Scootaloo: Brilliant.
evn teh writng iz liek ths
8,1RainbowcrashNBurn: put this into a script and put it into the scheduler: shutdown /t00
RainbowcrashNBurn: theres probably an option but failing that you can just schedule a task that runs the 'shutdown' command
It's worse than bad.
is te stream off?
/me is bored
It's obviously meant to be horrible, of course, but I don't know who it was a joke on.

There's a video..
Placebo: he answered 3 questions about mlp, all 3 had fairly easy answers
/me uses self destruct... its not very effective
/me faints
Ingwaz: doesn't make it any less fun :D
Uses Revive on Midnight_Tempest.
it was more of a 50/50 chance, once answer for each one was obviously wrong, of the other two, one was easily mor elikely
He still got all 3 =p
/me is revived 'o.o Son of a...'
indeed, i enjoyed it, just didnt want a rage going on like "ZOMG, CLINTON IS A BRONY!"
hence the show being called "Wait, Wait… Don’t Tell Me"
HAHA

so dat explains the eyes
since when are bronies "unemployed adult men in thei 20-30s"?

I dont like this pic that much
it's long, though.
i do play the ocarina atm...sort of...if the iphone ocarina app counts and i only know LoZ songs on it
Good night emangamer.
Ingwaz that would be the first thing I'd learn on the ocarina.
wonder what was the backstory in that pic? did dash injure her wings or she got too old?
Dken2021: Looks like old and deathbed.
OMG
SO SAD
T_T
;.;
havent been using it much though so i forgot requiem of light...
Well, the music for the Lunar Silver Star Story Complete has some very nice ocarina tunes...
Dken2021 she's definitely older; there's a pic of her at a younger age in the background~
WHY?
Ingwaz, isn't it the Prelude of Light? Either way, :D
8,1Ingwaz: all i'll say is that if you want to learn the cello, don't be tempted to buy an el cheapo £100 ebay instrument
/me is extremely sad now
Why is Dashie homeless?
8,1even i couldn't get a decent sound out of those things
And why do I want that pic?!?
Damn you, SB
8,1i can get a good sound out of a £300 stentor cello, though
kinda reminds me of MLD
yes
it does
prelude, requiem, w/e, i forgot, its requiem of shadow i knew, i was learning prelude of light, but didnt mess with it too much
/me manly tears have been shed.
10,02Oh man...don't know if I should show this image...

Strangely, I want that pic of starving, homeless Rainbow Dash,,,I don't know why though...

8,1Ingwaz: talent is just listening + practice
Kira_Pony_Yamato: It is SO touching
indeed, i imagine i would be better suited to a string instrument
Rainbow dash that would make me cry
SuperBrony64: Link to that last Rainbow one? Cavy would love/hate it.
I wanna learn a brass instrument, maybe a trumpet~
what IS this music from?
Phil Collins = Sadness

10,02otakon: Bicentennial Man

Minecraft Server closed :(
08,01back again
08,01it derped
dat derpage
silly windows
those files are broken, why are you trying to load them
Windows does try hard sometimes
it actualy worries me that its loading them
its vista which had driver signing, loading broken files is a problem
08,01minecraft is back
ah man, last time i saw that server i got 1.5gb of footage
also, has the ip changes, cause i can't see it
windows vista (shudder) is on the hdd
/me is going home
you should be able to run the boot CD from within vista
later Jim
bai Phase4
unfoundbug: i'm trying to recover the vista install, its broke
your recovering byusing a windows 7 cd?
well i dont have a vista iso
/me is using windows vista~
:<
08,01Phase4: use linux
08,01:P
i wish that worked
avg's kernel components were crashing windows
used a ubuntu disk to delete them
now crcdisk.sys is crashing windows
Its impressive how much you have broken windows
08,01windows is a good operating system, so long as you don't install any programs, load any drivers, or use it
its not my pc
08,01first course of action: truy a different windows dvd?
dont have another,unless you count the windows 8 beta
08,01tried it out yet?
nope
Hey look
a night when Phase4 didnt ping me
:p
wow
\o/
that DJ thing works
Yes it does
And its not like I dont actually DJ so its a win/win
:)
/me fads back into the shadows
dat fading
/me is home
ohai Jim
how's it going Phase4? :)
its good
>have class at 1pm
>normaly wake up at 11:30
>wake up at 6:30
oh fun
>dad fucking yells at you for not waking up fucking earlier!
>throw table at dads head
hi, bye
I always wake up briefly a few hours before I'm supposed to wake up, feeling fantastic
Fuck you dad I woke up 5 hours earlier than normal you ungratefull fuck!
ignore me, just passiing thru
then I go to sleep for an hour or two, and then I feel terrible
Don't worry about it Rain, he's probably just pulling your leg
i'm up at 6 every day
What is worse? He has /nothing/ for me to do today
every single day
like clockwork
and no he isnt. He said "If you cant get yourself up in the morning how do you expect to be able to go to another state and go to colledge!?"
You should do this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SPV9F5w7Ww
Im sitting there thinking "Why say shit like that when I woke up 6 1/2 hours before class?"
wait
I usualy wake up half an hour before class, and I do fine
he's giving you grief
for waking up at the CRACK OF DAWN?
......
he does it all the fucking time though
/me facepalms
That must be quite annoying for you Rain
I do the dishes. "Oh god we are all going to die of food poisioning"
I clean the rabbits "You are slower than the second coming!" which they say because they know I am agnostic
anything I do is returned with "Do fucking better!"
That's just mean
when I do all of those things 3x better than they ever could!
Im in colledge right now and my dad never even finished high school! Fuck him and his supiriority complex!
Well, what I think they do, is that they're trying to push you towards always doing your best
I push myself. They try to trip me up. They always have.
okay
I never had a problem doing anything by myself and then I move in whith them and suddenly Im fucking mentally handicapped and cant even eat breakfast by myself.
there is one thing for pushing yourself
and another for impossible goals
you can't please everyone
take MY mother for example
I cook rice all the time
she says I have it too high on simmer
there are some people you cannot please no matter what sadly
Im not allowed to cook because I will "burn the house down" =____________=
they will ALWAYS point out whatever flaws you have regardless of the severity of them
they point out flaws that dont exist
I got grief for not wiping up a few drops of tea
that landed on the stovetop whilst I was making it
that essentially turned into the entire stovetop
being scrubbed down and maintenance
Im anal retentive and make the kitchen /spotless/ and they /still/ say that we are going to get ants or some shit like that.
I keep my room spotless and they walk in every day and turn up their noses "why isnt your room clean? It looked like this yesterday."
I walk into their room and there is empty food bowls and trash everywhere! WTF!?
they have no room to talk down to me!
oh.... s-sorry about that guys... for venting... I just dont want to end up breaking my dads nose so I tend to vent when he does this shit...
That's ok, everyone needs to vent once in a while :)
They both just... make my blood boil...
Im glad I dont own a baseball bat...
i wish i knew english better to talk about your parents Rain
Bile slinging cunts is how I feel about them right now.
/me does not like anger
I catch them talking behind my back and they wonder why I give them a look for it
am i supposed to be seeing something here?
This isnt anger. Its 6 years of pent up rage.
at least there are less chances you grow up and be a lazy good for nothing scumbag..........
:(
Only because I have seen what that looks like and /I/ push myself to not become it.
i wish i had more severe parents
My parents arent the ones who raised me. /I/ raised myself. I have only lived with them for 5-6 years and they think they can claim that they raised me
they almost let me do whatever i want...... and thats bad
when they found out that I was agnostic they said "Thats not how we raised you!"
Oh...They're that kind of parents who think they can tell their kids what to think and believe, I see
Before these parents I could always do what I wanted. I never did though because I hated the idea of growing up to be like them.
I mean... come on... parenting... yeah you need to... push your child to do better... but when they do good... you need to atleast... say "good job"... once in a while...
agreed
I have never... heard anything... but... "why havent you done this better yet?"
. . . .
Im going to college for game design.... and every week they... come to me with an ad for some college... "you could be an archiologist" or "you could be a teacher" or "you could do something that you will hate so much that you eventually kill yourself"... They dont apriciate the fact that I /know/ what I want to do... and have known since I was 8...
well
don't let it get to you
do you know how many people go to college and dont know what they want to do...?
um
most of them
tons of them I'd guess
exactly
You should do what you like to, you don't need your parents approval to be happy
I know that. . .
I just wish they would show a little bit of pride in how much I push myself...
even if they dont deserve to say "I raised that kid"
I would still be happy if they said that to someone...
they never talk about me or what I do to their friends...
Im a damn math wizard and they look down on me because I have a problem with language...
When I do my chores I go a little slower than they would like... but only because I make sure I do the chore the right way... all they see though is me being lazy and good for nothing...
I... need to go... be alone for a while... I... I will talk to you all... later...
sorry about this...
Alright, take care Rain

(\

I like Bob Marley, it's just that his music's been connected to drugs that I mislike
dislike*
meh, unagreeable reason for me
Yeah, I don't personally like Bob Marley as a person, but I enjoy his muzik
they played somewhere over the rainbow at my friends funeral

don't let people ruin that stuff for you Rain
/me doesnt link emotions to death either :\
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2VCwBzGdPM Why do not have good muzik nowadays?
because dubstep
i still listen to that alot
hahahaaha
I mean there are a few new ones that are good.
dubstep sucks
^
tbh
^
SO HARD
LunaTheBeloved you old bean, how did you sleep?
But all the popular ones are terrible
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzLnDz87IN8
And yes Dubstaep is terrible
Dubstep is the sound that is produced when a Dicepticon violates an Autobot in the plot.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsZBX2RhDZE
Tally ho emangamer, I slept perfectly old chap, and you my good sir?
IDK, alex S makes dupstep pretty legit: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BseyCNMQBc
ahahahaahahahahahahahaha xcanox
I kinda like dubstep :<
I hate listening to the radio because it plays the same crap over and over again on a 2 hour loop
it reminds me of chiptunes in a way
so obviously electronic
LunaTheBeloved: I am ashamed to say that I pined for the companionship of someone last night, but I had aquired my Pinkie Pie figure and all was well.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s86ReVJhJCA
Rain: IKR....its so fucking annoying
I've found myself liking dubstep that isn't "filthy"
any see that video of that lady freaking out about owls last night
HO GOD... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QodrSfsboFk&feature=related
watch that
now
wooooo Mtropolis! neeato!
I found myself hating dubstep fans because they thing any form of techno = dubstep
>implying dubstep isn't filthy in pure form
emangamer, you you mind old bean, if we stopped talking fancy?
the top comments on that are amazing
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tpl6ncyxLGw
I'm a southerner, its too hardd
my sisters talkin fancy!
and I find that a good chair to the side of the head shuts them up very well
LunaTheBeloved: nah.....I was tust twantin to act like fancy somtimes...
LOL!
So, what is wrong with dubstep?
its retarded
What is wrong with it imo
That's an opinion, not a fact.
LunaTheBeloved: I'm from the south, and I dont have a problem with it
I'm looking for facts.
LunaTheBeloved: When I was just a little boy, standin' to my daddy's knee, my papa said "Son, don't let the man get ya, do what he done to me."
oh look i can hit buttons derp derp derp ddhhahaha
I just can't do it
LunaTheBeloved: "Cuz he'll get ya. Oh he'll get ya now."
Again ofna01, that's an opinion, not a fact.
is that I have not met a single fan of it who knows what is and what is not dubstep EspyLacopa
there's no FACT why dubstep sucks
LunaTheBeloved: Born on a bayou.
it just does
OK, here is my opinion on dubstep. The light stuff sucks, but the heavier stuff is really good. For example Ales S's CMC theme remix is about as light as I can get without me getting bored
And I can remember the 4th of July, runnin' through the backwood, bare.
IT all depends on how that artist approaches it
So dubstep, in fact, is not bad music. You just don't like it.
And I can still hear my old hound dog barkin', chasin' down a hoodoo there.
See, this is a newer band that I really enjoy http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KkUeRPjc-Y
KRYPTONIIITE
I was listening to SandStorm and some fuck walks up and says "I didnt know you liked dubstep!" I swung a chair at his face for it.
Great lyrics, and great muzik
Perfect combo
/me is reminded of every adult ever thinking their kids music is just horrible noise that should be banned.
And thusly, the cycle continues.

I dont mind if someone listens to it
i sorta agree with the adults on dubstep
XD
emangamer: y u do dis?
Emangamer, whats with the dead space there?
ofna01: like I said, it all depends on the artist
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tpl6ncyxLGw
EspyLacopa: idk.. my tabfill just fucked up
one of my favorite songs
I just get reeeeeeeally pissed when somone calls the stuff I listen to dubstep
Rain Sandstorm OOOOOWWWWW YEEEEAH!
ofna01: /]
anyone heard black stone cherry
what do you listen to Rain
that song is really really good
I need to hear more Dubstep before I can have a real opinion.
what emangamer
ofna01: /]
brohoof?
I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time
/)(\
yesh
I listen to trance, electronica, house, DnB, orchistral, and chiptune
what about light rock?
and people think that is dubstep :\
it's not dubstep if at least 2 windows dont break during the song
IKR!
LOL
Now this is my kind of music. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDNdFugsw1o
Fuck that emangamer
nope Tovler
Rain: it was a joke
exited the tab when i saw the name
I listen to techno songs all the time that would blow you out of your home
ofna01: This isn't my kind of music.
this is my kind of music http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-I8ALlYxdY
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBMT3OMEPwk
dubstep is just retarded synth and a beat. nothing more.
Tovler, See if you enjoy this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T--j0_yxBaY&ob=av2e
ignore the band name,just listen
I would re-link Alex S.'s dubstep but I feel like i've been enough of a whore for him already
and its fukkin slooooooooooow
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBMT3OMEPwk
now everypony needs to listen to this song http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV_0n5gp1fE&feature=BFa&list=PL714A1D4F144412EE&lf=mh_lolz
nope
ugh...5 finger death punch...
I love Florence + The Machine
i said ignore the name
I liked them before that PMV
their usually metal,but this isnt metal
LunaTheBeloved: Blue eyed funk? That song is actually awesome.
GOD DAMN...this is one of THE BEST PMV's ever made
what eman?
uuugh emangamer I hate that song
what song
Rain: but the PMV is just SOOOOOO good
And the unicorn is relevant to my interests
Tovler lol
emangamer I dont care about the pmv I care about the music. Quite frankly. I hate this song.
Tovler: http://twilight.ponychan.net/chan/meta/src/132580913545.gif
Now this is my ind of muzik http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-rDyHSc0QU

Rain: regardless of whether you like the song you have to admit the PMV is expertly done
I love Andrew Bird.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rivf9yfRtE
o_o O_O
not really emangamer. I have seen quite a few that were done better
Ok one more whoring myself out to Alex S http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4nAUPw8j5s&feature=related

ohai TOY_PON32
Ok I hat country music but you dont see me bashing it. Just stop hating on a genre and saying its bad because you dont like it
You said hi to me ofna01
LOVE AND TOLERATE PEOPLL
:P
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_2pGaPPOHI <-- How about this? Is this Dubstep?
k
Hey EspyLacopa
Hey, Rebecca, I mean TOY_PON32. We've being intolerant to each other's music. Wanna join?
/me gives TOY_PON32 his tophat and presents a shiney new monocle
emangamer tell me a single dubstep artist who has multi platinum recognition and is the role leader of an entire genre of music.
Rain: that's not possible, its too new of a genre
I wish but I need to go to school in a few
TOY_PON32: do you like my gift?
nooo
Thanks emangamer :3
/me puts them on
this is what TOY_PON32 looks like right now: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/588/
quite right
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoBE69wdSkQ <-- Wait, I've got it! This is dubstep!
Ahh yes :3
(If I post my favorite song… aw fuck it.) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yQgciCLaWU
emangamer, the only well named creator of dubstep is skrillex and he has said that he is not a dubstep artist. and his award winning music was his techno and DnB not his dubstep
Rain: have i once mentioned the name skrillex?
EspyLacopa: this is dubstep, and it actually a pretty good song
I was pointing out that he is the only well known dubstep artist emangamer
Rain: I dont like him
inb4 Justin Bieber releases a Dubstep album.
exactly
oh god
...
I do like some of Flux pavillions stuff though
^
that would be the day that music died Tovler
he can be good, but some of of his stuff sucks
i want to stab justin bieber repeatedley
Back
Hey LunaTheBeloved
I dont hate bieber. I hate his fans
I'm still waiting for Bill Gates to buy Beiber's copyright
Yeah I agree with Rain
Cello TOY_PON32
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mempPlglCI&feature=related
EspyLacopa: u liking that song?
Which one?
Atleast we can agree upon hating beliebers
^
/me is listening to william tell overture still
Bieber is a good singer (if he would lose the autotune) but GOD DAMN if his fans dont make me want to drown kittens
Rain: listen to this song, I will promise you will like it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=563QnEAGGOA
I've never heard his music.
Who's Bieber again?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpFUc8ABDMQ Glad to see we're still on muzik
what will you pay me if I dont like it emangamer?
I'm pretty sure his stuff doesn't get played on the radio
Rain: no, because it's impossible to not like it in the first 15 seconds
Bieber's fans will do anything to meet him...and I mean everything. It's fucking scary.
because the beginning of the song is the best
does this count as dubstep? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBMMkknN-Zg&feature=related
TOY_PON32: As scary as what Elvis Presley fans did?
well it is 40 seconds in and I havent heard a single thing I like about it emangamer

Okay. . Ranma has this problem with water. Now... there was a lot of fics that had him dealing with his "Feminine side"-- and they were all more or less grimdark. Deep psychological epics.
Well I know that much about Ranma
Over as in dead
But I thought, "The series is mainly a comedy. So... how would Takahasi do it?"

I used to love Robot wars
we need to get Robot Wars on this stream
00,10it gets boreing to marathon one show too much
wat
do a more recent episode,their better
Super Robot Wars
Besides, Avatar is for nerds. Sports, Reality Tv, and Mythbusters is all I need.
Sumica: agreed
gratuitous mechanical violence - ALWAYS worth it
Tovler: your kidding right?
bumbumtsss
Robot Wats = awsome
mythbusters is for nerds too
^
Oh and Breaking Bad, that show is excellent
u jelly nido?
All I need is Psych and MLP:FIM
Sumica - think you can find Robot Wars for the stream?
I haven't seen BB
YES
nah; I has my copy of mythbusters, so i'm good
00,10I could look in to it
wait
ROBOT WARS
the ANIME?
no
hell no
I never watched Psych, just Monk
from those clips in the opening cinematic here
mythbusters is like porn for engineers
eeyup

Monk is great, Psych imo is better
00,10no the rc robts that destroy each othere
THAT show

Dark, there are 2 groups of enemies

Why wouldnt you

ohay
happy birthday
hi
thatS
that's one weird ass recoil
best recoil
FIST BAD GUYS
pawnch
so whats this game about
knuckle the knuckleheads
05its not recoil
05its reload
melee the mutants
05its a 1 hadned lever action shotgun
from what i see, the reaload animation comes after the recoil and is less than half as long as the recoil
i could be leaking dumb all over the place right now, but that's my viewpoint and i defend it with a pitchfork
05you use the recoil to help propell the swing
Dark_Horst: lol
mfw I just slept for 16 hours...
:O
hai Tophat
Sleep well?
yes
back in the day, when levers were TEXTURES
except now I can barely move
back when health didnt regenerate
i miss those days
lol
i remember cnc renegade
find ALL the medkits
00,10Oh no I am almost dead i better take cover for 5 seconds
cnc red alert 2, get strat game ever
collect ALL the armor
Sumica: so realistic
Sumica: dont worry, bullet holes only take a few seconds to heal
medical attention unnecesary
XD
omg video games
the pokeball heals u
you're like Wolverine
i like the crysis approach on the healing
rocket launcher took your leg off? that might take a second or 2 more
00,10then again you proably could not take a rocket to the face eiter
unfoundbug: well except for Fallout
healing in crysis is just your suit's capacitors reloading. everything below is toast
sheilds make sense in caps recharging
but the cods have no excuse
00,10yeah in ME you have like no heath it's all shields
what game?doom?
bb everpony, see ya ( ..) /)
Moar Doomguy?
see u
I like L4D's healing, you actually gotta stop and heal someone
i would of liked it more had the healing had a bigger impact on uit abilities
I like the system in that new game that's coming out, NeverDead I think it is
MahBoi777: yeah
neverdead?
Yeah
attack of the flesh-eating killer vaginas from planet x noe?
whats they're system
Dark_Horst: lolwut
HAH!
marathon
PS3/XBOX360

did you SEE those green things?
tell me those are mouths and i hit you with a brick and call you liar
lol didnt bungie make this? :D
Most definitely mouths.
/me brick'd
You get bits blown off, and you have to collect them before demon monsters eat them
HARD

"The main soundtrack to the game is composed by Megadeth."
Yup

what has been seen...
/me fires a net cannon at Placebo
unfoundbug: I haven't played it but I heard it was good.
How are you today Sumica?
ok6_9
the main thing which put me off was apparently how different it was to its trailer
00,10I am well enough besides the insane wind and party on the pool deck planed at work.
lol i was bout to say "jump in the lava!"
trailer makes it look so focussed on the family, who never show up in the gmae itself
Sumica: am I invited to said party?
00,10I forsee some one geting impained with a umbrella if they dont move the party inside
party~?
will there be pinkie pies?
Pool Party + tornado speed winds = ??
that can't end well
00,10Sure evey one can come, I'll sneek you in the back way
pew pew~
/me sniggers
Sumica: where is your work, if it is close I will come
That some next gen AI right there.

out of production. no longer made. etc
That1Pony: people will just keep posting them
and there's theories that this is because they're going to retcon "Derpy" as her name
no worries, until sopa pipa and acta of course
Oh go no
god*
good evening everypony :)
good evening
damn why i no es writing?
hello Morty|Writing
ohai derpy

Hi!
It's that 1 pony again. Lol

Hey derpy! :)
lol
Oh hey derpy_pony and TopHat
hai
hey
woodh.
Is it normal that your minecraft character has a default derpy skin if you call him derpyhooves?

ohai Wrek
its much easier to find good pictures on e621 though MahBoi777

Me to! :)
Everytime im on a computer = Pony.
I just bring my laptop and use their wi-fi
I got one of my friends to skip through a store and yell rainbowdash is the best pony once :D
I found ponies after school...
Sometimes i put in words like Somepony and everypony and etc into my coursework.
I found that slightly annoying!
Teacher highlights it with question marks ;_;
I would like to swag a mean Vinyl wallpaper in the classroom!
lol Id give extra points for pony reference
00,10Oh dear is wrek threatening people again.
05btw mane
Hmm?

*my
00,10wrek realy likes your mane
It's long and torn in diffrent lengths and rather unkept

(Kyle Williams of the San Fran 49ers)
10,02Also, I got some stupid questions wrong on my psychology quix
10,02quiz*
unfoundbug: eeyup
10,02How was I supposed to know there was a difference between 'gender' and 'sex' ;A;
anypony here ever heard of the band "Johnny Hobo and the Freight trains" before?
unfoundbug: im too busy with flimflam brothers being stuck in my head
SuperBrony64: I knew that before I even took Psychology.
10,02It's a dumb technicality IMO >_<
winter wrap up cleared that one pretty quickly
not so much a technicality as it is rampant misuse of a word.
hello everypony
hi StickySyrup
ohai StickySyrup
how are we all?
RAWRity, I've heard of them
Great StickySyrup
procrastiating as usual
nice
most treat Sex and Gender as interchangeable words, but in a field that concerns the separation of the two, it's important to know the difference.
dat rayman
Where is the person I spoke to yesterday about Phoenix Wright?
what is the difference between gender and sex?
ScootaChicken|work: neat. You ever listen to their live album?
ohello people, i'm distracted by another room
I assume one is the physical representation (male female) and the other is what they identify themselves as
RAWRity: Sex is the biological differences between man and woman. Gender is the physological difference, a more personal atribute
nope RAWRity, whats it called?
otacon!
HAH I WAS RIGHT
sorry >.>
i did politics =)
ScootaChicken|work: "
sorry
Where is Otacon?
"Caught in the act of Not Being Awesome" is the album title.
I actually came online to say goodnight... so goodnight everypony
night sticky

Someone help me. I'm stuck.
goodnight StickySyrup
lol byebey =)

/me grabs Davie_Jones by the ankles and pulls on him
/me gives Rain a lot that says he's not in the mood for jokes.
I'll check it out RAWRity
10,02Point is it's all Justin Biebers' fault
Rain is best beatles tribute
1,3Bill Gates really should fix that
10,02IKR
He should
kirzstryfe: fix what?
grr.. he left...
1,3someone find RAWRity that tweet lol
10,02He should just buy Justin Bieber instead and force him to program indie games for the Xbox 360.

/me hums the Happy Birthday song and eats cake ^.^
oh my god Bill Gates
do it
do it nao
10,02Happy birthday Purple`Prose :3
I can't believe this! I'm stuck
10,02Can I has cake? :>
i have new found respect for microsoft :P
The game has a major fail in it!
Suddenly sonic
You know, Bieber would got away if people stopped constantly talking about how much they hate him.
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to Purple`Prose, happy birthday to you
*go
is that bill gates tweet real...
This is true RAWRity :P
Otacon!
ohai otakon
Are people still hating on that kid?
hey otakon
otakon everytime i see your name. I either see the following: Oatakon, Otabakon or Oatbakon
Don't even know why.
can't find a source for it
ohai otakon
i misread that as 'Oat bat kon'
Wow, sonic sure has gotten LOUD hasn't he?
wich sounds neat
/me huggles Purple`Prose
Like, I honestly hadn't even HEARD of Bieber until I visited a Metal music forum FILLED with threads of people getting angry about him.
3Happy Birthday!
I got DC'd
05anyone knows waht http://e621.net/data/51/ae/51ae210b7aafa65132eaf4f602f08a3b.gif?1328179747 refers to? slightly on the darker side if you dont liek that stuff
that's why I suddenly left and came back
I came back to a game Yatzee loves and it switches to a game Yahtzee hates
Which rule of the internet is "The more you hate it, the stronger it gets"?
Then again you could switch to any game and he'd hate it
brb
Wrek looks like samus because of the orange ball...
but thats all i can come up with.
I recognise it Wrek but cant out my finger on it
hell, the Bieber haters got "Baby" to the #1 viewed vid on YT because they started a campaign to Dislike it, giving him a fuckton of ad revenue in the process.
that tweet pic is fake, not on his twitter at all
laame
RAWRity: wait...he got big because of the people that dont like him?
unfoundbug: and you're surprised?
i was hoeful
hopeful*
He sure did, just like rebecca black
05rule 0 of the internet: 99% is fake
Trolls just hate Beiber because they Jelly :)
Wrek: what if the rule is fake?
definately, however about 5% you wish was real
RainbowcrashNBurn: pretty much. He got some popularity on YT, got picked up by a small label, and then EXPLODED in noteriety because of all the people ahting him.
same thing happened to rebecca black
Ponies thrive on love JB thrives on hate
go figure
ponies is best fandom
Really, looking at the Billboard charts, he's not a very big name compared to most pop artists out there, but he gets tons of internet attention, mostly due to people flailing about how they hate him.
RAWRity: which brings up a comment i constantly see on youtube "why go on a vid if you dont like what it is"
^ million dollar question
05cause haters are most often idiots
1,3does that mean there's a 99% chance SB is fake, or 99% of SB is fake?
>99% is fake
05hatters*
RainbowcrashNBurn: I don't even agree with that. You're free to go onto what ever video you want, and then say what you want, but people who honestly just want him to fade away aren't doing themselves any favors by constantly talking shit about him.
>99% of the internet
>Ponies are 50% of the internet
:c
^I think that's true
I mean, I hate to use this phrase but it's true; Haters Make Him Famous
ponies are everywhere on the internet
05but ponies arent on the itnernet
what do you mean?
05ponies are on the outernet, they jsut use the same portal
ponies ARE the internet
Portal was once the internet, ponies are now the internet
the internet is ponies
questionable logic, wrek, but i like it
RAWRity: im just saying that why do people who dont like what they know is in the vid, even consider clicking onto it, is that just the length that trolls go to i guess
and then something else will take it
05EqD is in orbit around the moon
i agree with ranbowcrashnburn
05usign a very logn cable
Maybe the Forever Alone chap
05which is why it takes ages to laod sometimes
He wore the internet crown at one point
what did I just walk into?
Wrek: just think urself lucky it aint wireless
ohai Dken2021
ello Jim
My friend showed me a vid "teens react to my little pony"
At one point the Bronies will take over the moon
Geneva convention be damned
One kid thought we were all just a bunch of trolls
StinkomanFan: just to see if luna is there?
Wait, you guys aren't trolling?

There's a rule that no nation can own the moon. It says nothing about individuals though.
05creep and proud!
ofc you are
Wrek: i c wat u did thar
and what good plot this show has...
Yes RainbowcrashNBURN
It does say something about individuals, but it doesn't say anything about online communites...

08,01RainbowcrashNBurn: thatcher's single varietal is good (katy is a bit too alcoholic for my tastes, but the cox's is amazing)

Way to keep Rayman relevant.
hahaha Jim that link is awesome
and THEN you blow up
saw ponies and tentacles, was nervous
Doctor Whoof seems to like Bikini Bottom
lol
i like bikini bottoms
makes one more/less of a brony to clop to ponies?
im waiting for the awesome day that they get david tennant to do VA for dr hooves
less
discuss
Doctor Whoof should poni poni
i do NOT clop to ponies
I personaly don't like r34
RainbowcrashNBurn - unfortunately, i think last episode was all the more reference he was going to get
I see it that it makes you too much of a brony
It neither makes you more or less of a brony if you clop to ponies, seeing as there are atleast two sides to every fandom
guy on a youtube comment said he has a deeper connection than i do cause he clops
rule #34
Clopping is the dark side
MirrorImage: probably, but its worth hoping for
hazard3 agreed
Come to the Dark Side
we have ponies
Morty|Writing: depends on which definition of "deep" he's using there...
Anikan came to the dark side
*they have furries
lol rawrity
he was killed for it
Molestia has TONS of
Evil beware, we've got waffles
nvrmind
raaaaAAAAPRE
that blue hand thing in the stream
I just had a bizarre pop into my head.

what is this Rayman:Origins?
Is it wrong that I miss the Rabbids?
i just looked at r34, and was thoroughly disgusted
who's KernelCobb?
i loved raving rabbids
yes morty
I'm kernelcobb
wassup
suprising to say that there IS a wierd side of rule 34
new guy...
whats with the super fat fetish 6_9
that is where Pedobear rules...
It's for a Web Comic called "The Adventures of the Rapeior" in which a sentient, levitating sword goes around raping things you generally don't see get raped.
im still waiting for rayman 4
new guy?
I've been here for quite a while..i suppose
I say we poni poni
WHOA
RAWRity: wth?

Like there would be a story arc where Rapeior goes and violates a mail box.

Morty|Writing: no, it's pretty interesting.

i hope to god they fix the physics problems in part 2, unless they replace sonic with pinkie then it will make sence
i think it would be fun
sounds like internet to me rawrity

Rawrity: wut?
/me finished gta 4 without any cheats
RAWRity: thats one of the reasons i hate her i presume
God DAMNIT ROMAN

Build MASS with SASS
http://pokebeach.com/scans/next-destinies/57-gardevoir.jpg
I give not a single fuck about what message a musician promotes if the music is good. But Perry has some undefinable anti-talent that makes everything connected to her suck.
deadlyderp i think u need to go read something funny
Now worried that my laptop will bust down too
Doctor Whooves was in last weeks episode

but really you just play them with other pokemon to make it almost not painful at all
Lol number four
7 lolwut
like zekrom you just play it with a bunch of eels
nah, it's a recording I think, like an autopilot, but I think that's CoD for the Wii
25
and reshiram can use your re-flip guy
lol 2 is hilarious
wii? you sure? controls look too smooth to me for it to be wii O.o

Think of it, Equestria Daily: As far as the eye could see
Ooo, The Mask is on ABC Family
they should do a stream of DMC4
oh hey, heals
The Mask is now pony
KernelCobb: everything you touvh now becomes a pony
it's more for it's power
*touch
Hack the FBI and add ponies?
I know
/me hugs self
but heals are good too
or better yet, when the HD pack comes out they should have a week long DMC marathon
What would happen if The Mask and Pinkie Pie teamed up? :s

/me hops over to StinkomanFan and noms him
^^ this is true
exactly
Ow!
canterlot even: clothed
h-ops are Half-Ops
I've been bitten by a Were-mod!
whos streaming?
H-ops got Mad Hops.
so that makes ponyville a nudest society?
Get the Silver banhammers!
Hazard3: autopilot
mfw im only person awake in house and no1 said goodnight :O
Dken2021: eeyup!
shit
Ponyville ponies like to be free
Dken2021: Yes that's right
lol
applejack has a hat...
does that count?
KernelCobb: eenope.
1,3you can't contain the plot power of Ponyville :3
Big Mac only got his name once he came to Ponyville
Dken2021: thats a 3rd reason i love ponyville
i'll just use your attack thank you lol
Ohai
twilight never changed in the show though
yeah
would Granny Smith count?
even in first ep she matched with ponyville
episode 11 season 1
even though shed be the only one in the castle like it
wait nvm
They still dress up in the Winter c:
well...now that I think about it, in the 1st episode, the ponies we see twilight talking to on the way back to her library didnt have clothes either
^_^
Well they wear dresses and stuff but every so often
at the gala
episode 3 season 2 acutally she went batshit insane
also, remember how in "Look Before you Sleep" how rarity and AJ were sharing a bed...IN THE NUDE! scandalous!
/me put first ep on to check
Hazard3: Hi GURLS 6_9
hahaha
And then that means the CMC episodes are...
latest episode: fluttershy's nudity realization!
CHILD PORN :o
hahaha
she knows
1,3-.-
lol
maybe clothes in equestria is a formal attire altogether
Well anyways I'm going to night school so see ya later guys :3
cept socks
goodnight TOY_PON32
StinkomanFan: put a pedobear sign on THAT

Cypresswolf: but then why would the Appleloosan ponies wear clothes?
/me writes a fanfic about a pony nudist colony.

"wait, wut?" THE END
best ending ever
Tovler: Good luck on that
i would read it
Desmund the moon bear
StinkomanFan: here, I shall give the first word "the"
well, Appleloosa is out in the desert. Think about any western you've seen, its hot during the day, clothes help keep the heat off.
the sand may also harm skin during windy days
Or I could make it so that some ponies ate the Apple from the book of Genesis.
a naked Braeburn
/me nosebleed
O_o
clothes help to both keep off heat and keep in cool
so. who else is watchin ep one now lol
lol
Suddenly I want more of Braeburn...
I <3 Braeburn
clothes vary depending on terain and surround environment in that regard.
Uncle Apple Stroodle is best pony
Viking ponies
he is far more handsome than Big Mac <3
Noogie noogie noogie!
;)
"But who needs love? Not Me! Who needs friends? I got Me! Who needs drugs? Maybe! Who needs sex? I got me!"
why not zoidberg?
what???
Braeburn's voice is like a babbling spring brook next to a field of daisies
ohai RAWRity!
AAAAAAAAAPPULOOSA
Do ponies give wet willies too? I want to see a clip where somepony (preferrably Rarity by her dad) recieves a wet willie in jest :)
And I forgot where that analogy was going
pony wet willy would hurt like hell i asume
The CMC should become Bullies for one episode
Many lols would be had
Cypressswolf: I think that'd be called a wet hoof
For some reason, I like the Flim Flam Brothers more than Braeburn
^Yay Verily!
But who needs love? Not me! Who needs friends? I certianly do! Who needs drugs? Not me! Who needs sex? Nah, thats boring.
^
MahBoi777 that might be taken into the wrong context
Rarity's plenty wet already
true
...wait
lol
I think its because they're tall. I like my colts tall.
Gave that pony a monorail
Tolver: they got Swag
Ponies love monorails
monorail monorail monorail

FIM Flam?
flim flam....simpsons monorail...music man Trouble in Rivercity
Friendship is Witchcraft lol
i've only watched 1 of those

Hey everyone!
StinkomanFan: ikr
ohai Randomnerd
hey Randomnerd
diggy diggy hole, ohai Randomnerd
[sound of a record scratch] = best name.
:)
Step one: find a world leader who likes Ponies
^
[that sound that emits from your chair that sounds like a fart] best name
step 2 give this world leader more power
I'm usually lookingfor a world leader that would look good in a hat, so we can make hats come back into style.
Ovaria would be a nice name.
StinkomanFan: done. http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-economy-in-the-toilet-watch-ponies.jpg
Step 3:???
Can someone put in a good video to stream?
if Chuck Norris was a brony, we wouldn't need a world leader
chuck norris is both brony and brony hater
StinkomanFan: alternativley step 1: vote for vermin supreme
Quick give him your Life Force!
imokwiththis.img
KernelCobb: he is?
Chuck Norris made Expendables 2 PG-13. I'm so over him now.
eeyup
RAWRity: So I have permission to emulate your voice... or somepony else do it?
Well, he rides horses.
seeing as Chuck Norris is an enormous homophobe, I...doubt he'd be into Ponies.
@meter metermeter
6 metermeter is 39% . (742)
But yeah, he'd probably not care for ponies.
emangamer: possibly, if you can figure out what My voice sounds like.
But ponies are3 the definition of MASCULINE
@metermeter meter
@ponymeter pony
He probably has like 5 ranches with ponies in them

@boringmeter stream

well Scoot-Scootaloo did come in earlier
00,03>Bronies
00,03>Trolls
Ingwaz: It's a troll thing that has been going on for quite a while now. I would have thought they would have stopped. They call themselves Bronies and love everything my little pony related, not normally gay either.
^_^ I just found Heyyeyaaeyaaaeyea for 5 hours - no good can come of this! Myaah!
Shedinja is buffteed by sand. It's a OHKO
That lucky BASTARD
00,03Do people even know what trolling is?
I wish I had Bronies in my School
i do have at least 1 other brony in one of my college classes, i think possible 3 others actually though
My mother laughed in my face when I told her I was a Brony :'(
00,03As far as I know, only 3 people in my college are bronies :(
Cypresswolf: you have just found me something to do, i thank you
MLP was brought up today in class and a guy said dont hate on bronies, so i'm betting hes in there with us
Who needs real friends! You've got the Intenet lol
13trololo?
and Scoot-Scootaloo, you might be surprised how many colleges students are bronies, we easily make up the biggest group
That's pretty harsh, StinkomanFan :(
It is
you know what's fun to do in Pokemon Black/White wireless battles?
this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3V7XeqYdgw
00,03I am an open Brony! I make it obvious that I am one!
Well, it could have been worse, you could have been sent to the shrink...
Ingwaz - it completely depends on the college, of course
00,03Yet only 3 know about it :(
I sent MYSELF to the Shrink afterwards
Robert Morris University has someone *trying* to get a group together, though at last check, he's got all of 8 people (in a school of about 4000+)
i just got some buttons to decorate my messenger back with, i'm not the type to go up and shout it at people or anything, figure that will act more like a calling card
i would be more open of being a brony in college, if there wasnt strong vibes against them as a whole in my class :(
Dem sparkles! Alex Louis Armstrong is the ONLY man allowed to Sparkle! 6_9
i only know of 1 other brony in my class, possible 2 coz of references he makes
and MirrorImage, of course it depends on the college, but even with that, college students make up the biggest group of bronies
The way I came out as a Brony was them Pocket Ponies
Hm... I'll save this honey bun for tomorrow.
You put a paper poni in your pocket
I probably would've met some bronies in the anime club, but I don't go to that university anymore
i've considered starting a brony group, but i dont really know what we would do...
/me is now just embarassed, doesn't feel like a fat bastard.
Well, the NYC area Bronies have it easy
And when people try to mock you for being a brony call them out on there sexuality
Im 20 minutes in :)
We've got a pre-existing group.
Worked for me
RAWRity: now thats how you play pokemon
00,03NYC bronies have it easy?
omg, aron is the new fear, only more deadly
00,03I doubt it...
I mean that Meet-ups are possible.
nah StinkomanFan, i'm secure in my sexuality, and i could probably pretty easily argue the case for MLP
/me prays to Based Aron
00,03Oh yeah! I would like to Meetup with people there!
how is this for mindfuck: person in my class who is openly gay, is the most opposed to ponies/bronies
And there's a 10 hour version when this one is done *psycho Twilight smile*
Inb4 a CSI:NY episode about Bronies
BronyCon has a meet-up page and it's easy to get together that way.
ponies =/= homosexual activity
majority of bronies are heterosexual
something like 80% i believe
I still need to see the CSI episode on furries.
StinkomanFan: Ugh... good point. There's been eps about "Pony Play" and LARPers.
Or was that Bones?
00,03I have tried to go to one of the Meetups, but with Campus rules, I'm pretty much limited :/
? campus rules?
i just wish there were at least some meetups in uk
00,03Yeah, my campus has a policy where you can only go so far...
Scoot-Scootaloo: I take it you're still in High School?

Accuse them of hiding behind an Imaginary boyfreind

that sucks, you think they would let you have some freedom
00,03Sup otakon!
hello?

I drink every day if something is available, but don't plan on going anywhere afterwards. Helps to have a bar within walking distance

Its no problem at all. Its currently closed for fire code voilations, but when it is open, Im only down there every couple of weeks.
Go downstairs and watch ponies to get over your hangover

00,03Wjo's going to Bronycon? I know I am!
*once every couple of weeks* They have good steaks, but a bit high priced
Friends of Mine are in a group for Steampunk's World's Fair in NJ
We're doing pony-inspired costumes, and I'll be wearing mine to BronyCon after that.
probably a stupid question, but what is steampunk?
I want to go ;^;
i wish i could go, the special guests line up are awesome
so, you guys know that abomination that is "Jersey Shore"?
yup
and you know Snooki?
It's ending
I've been saving up to put in my own bar at home, got a nice collection of custom pony glasses, and a little stock pile of my favorite drinks. Just need the furniture and a remodel
/me puts steampunk on the list of stuff white people like.

Figs are evil
RAWRity: yup http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2011:14&version=NIV
Yeah, that's in the bible -folks whip that one out for guilt by association.
*eats fig newton*
/me 's grandfather has a fig tree in his backyard :3
the bible says to not eat figs
/me loves fig newtons
Are Ponies in the Bible?
ie: The Bible is full of Horrible and Crazy things, therefore everything in it is Horrible and Crazy.
I thought so
Horses are in the bible, yes.
IngloriousPony89: ikr?
/me reads the bible
most of the things in the old testament are crazy sounding today
Then Ponies are kosher!
Oi!
yet people still use it to slur the gays
The Bible works a lot better when it's not treated as a text book.
/me reads the Qu'ran
oi oi oi
ikr MahBoi777?
the in context 'dont eat figs' thing makes less sense than 'figs are evil'
What Randomnerd said
And then the chat went to sleep
Phase4: if figs are evil, I'm goin to hell TT__TT
I love figs
We have figs in the back yard

Hows it hanging yall
Hey DJMidgetBrony
For all I know, 4th graders have made Derpy an actual perjorative. And us say Derpy is a neutral term is use being senile.
"Hey kids, I'm Mrs. Derp!"-Ditzy Doo
Not bad DJMidgetBrony, how're you doing?
Hey DJMidgetBrony
^best teacher ever
I'm blond and I find that Blond "Ditzy" pony offensive.
00,03Internet is gonna be down for a while. Be back soon <3
kay Scoot-Scootaloo
bai Scoot-Scootaloo
toodles Scoot-Scootaloo
Cya Scoot-Scootaloo.
see ya Scoot-Scootaloo
Neeed to get my setlist done for DJing tommorow
Bai Scoot
Bye Chicken
bai Scoot-Scootaloo
and then there were two
But let's say, for argument's sake, that Studio B and hasbro HAD intended for Derpy to be mentally challenged: WHY WOULD THAT BE A BAD THING? Why would having a mentally challenged character be offensive? SHould children be sheilded from the fact that mental retardation exists?
...Daaaaaaang.
Daaaaaayum.
I say we take it to OBAMA
You going to slip a pony song into your setlist? :P
in the eyes of most parents thes days RAWRity, yes.
tl;ra
RAWRity: Rainbow told Derpy to just sit there, which could be seen as ableist.
:|
Not the point really
IngloriousPony89: well then those parents can fuck right off. Acting like mental retardation doesn't exist is much, much more harmful.
/me 11,01waves and explodes
It shouldn't really offend people
ohai Nittany_Discord
people get mad over the stupidest things
Also, Derpy seemed unaware that she caused all that damage.
/me waves back at Nittany parts
Oh wonderful
/me cleans up Nittany_Discord mess
aside from that small oops my bad
Nittany_Discord's*
"Doctor Whooves implies that Time Travelers are cowardly horses!"
oh they're changing derpy's name?
Maybe she didn't give a single fuck
Tovler: no, she was aware of it. SHe apologized, AND acknowledged that she's acidentally caused it.
Nittany_Discord!
Gummy logic
Dken2021: no official word on that.
just rumors piled on top of rumors.
Yo dog we heard you like rumors
Rumor sandvich
^
Tasty rumors?
11,01Is this argument over the parents and fans getting angry over Derpy?
Mmm Sandvich
And what was with that thundercloud anyway?
Delicious rumors.
rumorception
11,01I think Derpy's staying.
Rumors in layers?
tastes like bacon
"You were almost a JILL SANDWICH"-Jerk nopony likes
If I was king Solomon, I would chop Derpy in half and replace her with Screwball.
King Soloman is Celestia's dad
Tovler: No, not derpy
Trufax
Ok, it's suppertime for me. Might be on later, depending on how strong my Dark Souls addition is. Later everypony <3
/me gets slapped with a King Salmon
toodles IngloriousPony89
11,01King Solomon never chopped anyone in half.
He wanted to
11,01I know.
No it was a test of faifth
*faith
later IngloriousPony89
Who said he didn't cover his tracks with that?
it was to see who cared for it more
11,01He had someone attempt to chop a baby in half when two women were arguing over it.
/me turns on his ps3 for a dr who marathon
11,01And the true mother came forth in the end.
13http://i.imgur.com/zhe3D.jpg
Isn't that from the bible?
11,01Yep.
The Binding Of Isaac
Spoilers: Issac get attacked
No King Solomon proposed that they chop it in half, and one person cared too much to let that happen. Solomon then let that person have the whole thing
Isaac ends up just fine though
I'm all for a name change only because Derpy is a painfully uncreative name.
13nevar
11,01I'm all for leaving Derpy alone.
Well that's like saying change any of the pony names because they are painfully uncreative.
Most of them are pretty simple.
But that's how we know them.
11,01I liked "Ditzy Doo" more, but I respect their use of "Derpy."
So we don't want them to change.
surprised Twilight Sparkle passed legal.
StinkomanFan: ;____;
Lyra becomes Heartstrings
The only other lazy I can think of is Lyra, which isn't very lazy.
Lyra is best human
Ahahaha ScootaChicken, you'd have to try a lot harder than that to seriously offend me. :P
11,01If the show creators changed things on the whim of fans, we might have G3. (remember who's supposed to watch MLP).
I just realised that all of the mane six plus a couple of others all have their own wikipedia pages
Cry some more and it'll be from bottom up!
/me opens a bottle of Sweet Apple Acres Hard Cider
I didn't even know actual disabled people got ragged on. Who does that?
I approve.
Does anyone remember back when every single Pokemon had a wikipedia page?
What do you mean, Tovler? D:
that was awesome...
ScootaChicken lol
ALL the Pokemon
Hahaha, you're not even trying eman.
I never really got why lyra was a human
emantrollslayer: no, talking about the 11th doctor would though
Now only Mewtwo is that awesome
There's nothing to forgive. :>
Lyra sitting like a human and the fandom exploded
Because Mewtwo will F YOU UP
Oh that's why
: D
Lyra is a silly pony

I never really understood book clubs, but I suppose it's more about bonding than making reading books simultaneously.

Physical books.
Though there's something to be said for a portable library.

die, physical books, die

u silly filly
I've been listening to audiobooks lately, while doing other things.
hi SuperBrony64!
Half my family has a nook of their own, but Ive always like books I can hold and flip through.
Hi, SuperBrony64
Cypresswolf: sorta depends. I personally prefer physical books, but digital books are more affordable.
SuperBrony64! :3 wub
ohai SuperBrony64
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Adansonia_grandidieri04.jpg because trees are awesome.
Well, easier to store.

plus, I don't need to worry about tearing a page with a digital book.
dafaq is with that tree
that tree
look, it's rafiki's home
10,02I'm still stuck in class O___o
:) I like listening to the complaining when the nook's battery runs out...while Im still reading my book
is a weird penis
Phase4: it has the stranged boner right now.
Don't try and charm me with that Fluttershy, Tovler!
gurl, that tree is nothing but trunk, hot damn <3
RAWRity: its realy happy to see me
plus, digital books means less deforestation.
What is it with RPGs and magic keys?
deforestation means less mosquitos though right?
More electricity and expenditure of fuel for the e-reader.
mosquitos are bitches
You gotta charge the thing.
Randomnerd: but burning one book would power a single nook for its entire lifetime
net gain
as long as you buy more than one book
Its lifetime?
yeah, a bookshelf makes a room smell nice, but that about it.
if it was harry potter
Guy Montag would Disaprove with your silly E-readers
I like old books that are hard to find. I found some poetry books by Grace Carol Noll a few years ago. That sensation of discovery is something you dont get downloading a book you can find in seconds. But thats just me.
^
is true
Well, it wasn't the book's material, it was the fact that people didn't wnat their beliefs challenged.

@ mah harry potter joke Randomnerd?
0,5DAEDRIC BOW LOOKS COOL
Fahrenheit 451.
I've read that
Not a bad read.
LC is a funny filly
i've only read the Farenheit 451 Graphic Novel.
It was about the dumbing down of society, many people believe it to be about Government censorship.
if cod is tsill screaming imma kill my gerbil
streaming*
Bah, I just called it Farenheit 911. Damn you Michael Moore
Mortys_Mortician: poor gerbil
Expecially books in a series like Redwall. took me 5 years to collect the set. I'd buy 1 or 2 at a time, read them, then hunt for the next in the series
I read it every year for banned books week.
ok whoever is streaming
RAWRity: There was a graphic novel of it?
my gerbil es in le blender
Yup.
10,02Dat LordCelestia
LadyCanary: eeyup
LadyCanary: Yup.
I had to do a report for a freshman course
Interesting. Is it any good, RAWRity?
/me kills the stream and switches back on "Moby Dick"
well, more like list stuff that happened, but really liked that book
0,5Dat 64
if only Randomnerd
is this stream live or the loop that was on earlier?
dose mods
Everypony, I now have 1 voice actor, 1 composer, and 1 artist for my project.
LadyCanary: I think so. Haven't read the novel, so I can't speak on its accuracy, but I enjoyed it.
is anyone here interested in a button to turn the stream off? i wrote one for me and might add it to the script
yay honey whistle
what project?
The script is being written.
Honey_Whistle: whats your project?
It's the pause button, why worry?
My PW/MLP project.
Honey_Whistle good job, hope you get more to work with you
PW?
Phoenix Wright.
Randomnerd - that still ultimately takes up memory as opposed to removing the stream outright
coo man coo
Fair enough -My laptop has no real power, so I never notice.
Still no reply from Seth.
smack dat ass wario
you obviously haven't blue-screened your laptop then trying to play Minecraft and watch Youtube
simultaneously
If anypony wants to volunteer as a voice actor, please PM me.
for what honey?
Randomnerd: http://derpy.me/CexZX << this is before i wrote the button, was doing it manualy. its what i meen by turn the stream off
/me points above.
as in Turnabout Storm or something unrelated to that?
Phase4: got it
It's not Turnabout Storm, it's my own project.

(Dude, It's Groundhog Day, not Groundhog's Day)

Oh, Groundhog Day.

I like the sound of that.

i totally want to write a movie called Daylight Saving Time now.
dooo eeett
it's not too late
do we have a streamer and techie?
http://www.gocomics.com//nonsequitur/2012/02/02
"One man who has to turn back the clock, in a fight against the darkness. Daniel Radcliffe stars in...DAYLIGHT SAVINGS"
we got plenty of techies floating around
Ilike teh catch line RAWRity
DST: One man will travel through time.
"Only to discover... he's not alone."
Actually a lot of people will travel through time… like all of them.
evening
One man: "Dude... did the whole world just travel back in time?"
We can show it tomorrow before the stream :D
Except the ones in Arizona. and Hawaii.

Another dude: "Yeah... I think we did..."

is that

11,01Shizuka is an adbot!
they won't correct them - at most, they'll fix her voice to a more Libman one and actually call her Ditzy
:O
13do it fillies, professional grade modeling software doesn't go free often
13or just download it and put it away :P
Oh wait. Was this the Shizuka that Shikuka warned us about?
I don't even know how to use it, but will dl it anyway
ohai people, i'm distracted from my distractions
honestly I doubt they'll do ANYTHING to her, other than issuing a small, vague "apology" to those stupid enough to take offense to it.
Behind offended doesn't entitle you to anything.
it's purely PR though
we have corrupted MLP - they don't want to let it get *too* corrupted
Scootachicken is fast.
inb4 Vinyl is named Vinyl and has red eyes.

now that would be interesting to see
GOOD NEWS EVERYPONY, you just read this in my voice
where did the red eyes even come from?
emantrollslayer nice try
I'm an albino and I find Vinyl offensive
emantrollslayer - dude... you're Morgan Freeman?
emantrollslayer: I don't know what your voice sounds like sooooo
anyone else watching the eqd stream?
enope
nope - i'm playing Slots at the Sierra Madre
I should be though
I'm on Skype
but the convo is kind of dead atm
i dont use skype... gotta pay for it right?
i don't think so
Seth's OC still looks like a Flim Flam brother.
Midnight_Tempest: only for premium edition
i see
I might watch it. I'm sure the Derpy thing will come up.
well
i think it's just MictheMicrophone and his Dramatic Reading month
they are basically redacting Derpy
because people were offended by her name
fuck that... best name ever imo
argh
the voice was the only problem i had with that scene
and even that was a minor gripe
again, there's no solid evidence that they are redacting Derpy yet.
Who are these shadow bronies who are attacking Derpy?
rumors on top of rumors on top of rumors. that's all we have atm.
the're actualy offended by a pony's name?
Phase4 - it's the internet
Tovler: idiots who think "Derpy" is a slur against the mentally challenged.
i wouldn't be surprised if 4chan is behind most of those "offended" people
thats more silly than people tend to be, then again MirrorImage is right
they could easily modify the voice to be more feminine, done... its not like calling her Ditzy is any less offensive to people...
11,01test
RAWRity - ... one sec
I just wanna know why we're deciding that Derpy is a slur?
I dun wanna see Derpy gone :'c
Is it being used by every 4th grade asshole ever? Just asking.
Tovler: because some people take innocuous words way too seriously.
the only people that complained are people that have family memebers that are mentally handicapped...
its a freaking cartoon... just let it go people...
I've seen people say that using the word crazy in any way is somehow ofensive to those with mental illnesses
Maybe screaming DURRRRRP is offensive?
http://bronies.memebase.com/2012/01/27/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-super-funny-title/
RAWRity: then thats offensive to any person that isnt considered normal by you, or me, or the guy next door... its just silly
well no use in raging over it
seriously, who are these shadow bronies? I guess they aren't from 4chan.
she is no longer Derpy canonically
I have literally NEVER heard anybody ever try to insult a mentally challenged person by saying they're "derpy"
how do people open skype chats with multiple people?
they'll probably edit the video
11,01I hope this Derpy uproar doesn't scare Studio B, Hasbro, or whatnot into not doing something like Derpy again. Even worse, I hope they don't remove Derpy.
and i quote - "Since when did Derps make fun of mental disabilities? It's a name for funny faces people make using crossed eyes."
make it ditzy
O.O
Mortys_Mortician: you have to make a group
wut?
She's still called Derpy on Hubworld.com
dat you must be new here XD
idk how to do that >:0
i've got the EQD stream playing right now.
what are they talking about?
11,01EqD stuff. :p
somepony just said "Wehn, in the last 100 years, have musicians been good role models? pffffft"
they are being kind aobnoxious
This EQD stream is putting me to sleep.
aren't they always?
durr hurr inception
a slight nod to crookedtrees
someone pm me the EqD stream please?

Hello everyone!
/me mirror force trap card
OH
but in all seriousness I have never- ABSOLUTELY NEVER- seen anypony use the term "Derpy" to mock the mentally challenged in any way. Even those who did portray her as somewhat mentally disabled, it was never to mock or insult, if anything it was supportive of the mentally challenged.
^
hai BEN
my supportive arrow asserts that I am equally clever
^
As does mine!
you can't do that we're in a duel
Bah!
Time for a duel over that rule!

I really don't give a damn about the Derpy thing, honestly.
so guys
Everybody, I have great news!
allo?
It's funny. The dictionary definition of retard is far kinder than the one for disabled, yet retarded is the big bad word.
I only noticed there was a big deal when some douch said "What now, DITZYFAGS?"
What is it BEN?
@pony

So you know how yesterday I found out I'm really Ben Kenobi?
How?

Yeah BEN
..............................................................................................................................................................................................
11,01Want me to try and play a game on stream?
BEN: O RLY?
you did?
And considering I contemplate the Equestrian Military's make-up, I'm pretty familiar with what happens when you OVERTHINK IT.
Sure Nittany
oh good, I'm not offensive. Unless somepony thinks that name is mocking Allies WW2 fighters.
@pony pikipikipikidesuka
6 pikipikipikidesuka is 7Brae8burn
yes Nittany, please do
11,01What game?
Well, I put in an appeal today to the council of dead Ben's and guess what?
what do you have, Nittany?
Any Nittany
...oh god, that picture on Mic's stream...
So this livestream isn't gonna address the elephant in the room?

Wow. Bring back Magnet when I'm not around, huh.
hey Nittany_Discord, can I add you on steam?
ScootaChicken: they're mesmerizing
well i'm going back onthe roof again

yeah, we still need to know who spearheading this campaign.
right now they'd just be discussing rumors and misinformation

11,01Midnight_Tempest: Sure. kce_killer_kyle
DERPDERPDERP is gonna need to change his name tomorrow.
His name was in all caps anyway
Tovler: we've already killed him to stop his offensiveness
ScootaChicken: as I am now alive as well, I must urge you to go to sleep!
May I as well Nittany_Discord?
11,01Sure.
sleep is difficult when you're coughing violently every five seconds
oh god
its BEN
what have you done BronyState...
ScootaChicken: No worries, I am a living being now!
no you're not
also, Tovler, you need to hange your name beause it sounds too close to "tardy". They also need to change that line in Lesson Zero now.
ScootaChicken: sleep is for the weak, not that I'm implying anything
GabeMoist: Olga Orly?
11,01Anywho, lemme see what I have.
ScootaChicken: nO! you must sleep!
take some medicine!
hm, Twilight did get a little tardy in that episode.
I think I might just go listen to some Creedence Clearwater Revival and try to conk off to sleep...
also, somebody gifted MictheMicrophone Steam on Steam
that usually helps
ScootaChicken....YES YES YES YES
ohai LadyCanary
I've been here ^^"
ScootaChicken: don't forget to check out that Johnny Hobo album.
wow... Nittany has alot of games on steam, and i got a few of them too :)
ScootaChicken: try not to think of the things that can kill you in your sleep!
tardy and retarded have the same latin root word, or something like that.
hey LadyCanary, have you heard there cover of Heard it Through the Grapevine?
And I loves me some Creedence Clearwater Revival
11,01I've played a fraction of them.
I sure will RAWRity
Well of course!
no sleep for me after all -_-
wow, other people listen to CCR... thats awesome
11,01CCR rules.
agreed
  ▲
ain't no rest for the wicked
lots of people here like CCR
no
no indeed
Tovler: mostly because "retard" literally just means "to slow" and is A VERB.
  ▲
O...M...G... I have EYES!
fine, quite a few people here like CCR
rofl
lets not have this debate kthx
  ▲
trying to reinstall fallout new vegas. taking too long
▲ ▲
lol
BEN: how many??
hey LadyCanary, you like Iron Maiden?
....
Yes <3
as in "This canyon will certainly prove to retard our journey"
MahBoi777: TWO! Two FUll and REAL EYES!
  ▲
Iron Maiden? EXCELLENT! *guitar solo*
BEN: NO WAI
: D
Triforce!
yep, and gay used to be a double entendre
I saw Iron Maiden in August last year : D
it was awesome
...Lucky ;^;
Now all I need is a living title, as to not frighten the who dont know my true story
pina colada
word evolvution just isn't evolution.
but they didn't play Run to the Hills ;___;
s are good
Awww
Did they play Fear of the Dark?
yeah
...lol, 10,689 pre-war money in Fallout New Vegas
lol
/me has a constant fear that someones always near
;3
now i just need to find a store with 100k+ caps to convert that back into... Caps
lurking in the shadows
meh, Iron Maiden can make some good music, but they never like to leave the tiny box they've made for themselves.
welp
that's a LOT of chaos on that stream
alot!
/me just remembered who CCR was and cannot believe he forgot!
so much chaos
I've never knowingly heard Iron Maiden
LadyCanary, do you like their new(ish) album?
freakin love steam right now ^_^ a month and a half ago, my computer crashed and I lost everything that wasnt backed up. found my old steam name and it has all the game info and is re loading it
I havent heard their new stuff lately.
we need more Chaos... release the warp daemons!!
their latest album is actually pretty good
explosive chocolate milk
which surprised me given how much I dislike most of their stuff after Fear of the Dark
The Final Frontier is the same sound as their last 3 so, if you liked those, you'll like it.
I never really listened to their last three...
I bought Final Frontier and hoped it would be good and was pleasantly surprised
So who here likes Parov Stelar?
BEN: Catgroove. /)
If ya'll happen to hear some terrified or angry hollering, that'll be me. Either Im on the war path or found a hive of ghouls or something :)
Augh... Constitution! Y U NO UNAMBIGUOUS?!
Flaria: (\
Cypresswolf: I shall ready the earmuffs
Cypresswolf: And if you encounter a hive of butterflies?
im cheering for the hive of ghouls... those are more fun to deal with
Ill be playing in the dark. always better in the dark! Butterflies will be flamed ^_^
I also enjoy the musical stylings of Queen and Caravan Palace!
Queen <3

Queen is great
What? They could be Discord butterflies! better safe than sorry
Bohemian Rhapsody!
I only really have 1 Queen song I like.
oh no... derpy T__T
Don't Stop me Now
I think my personal favorites are "Don't Stop Me Now", "Under Pressure", or "Bohemian Raphsody"
We are the Champions
oh, you guys like Don't Stop me Now?
I do
well LOOK AT THIS: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DR0GP2MW5M
under pressure is awesome, cause it has David Bowie as well...

Cypresswolf: Challenge the ghoul to a dance battle!
