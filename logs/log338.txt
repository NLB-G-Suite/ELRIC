/me is home
its good
>normaly wake up at 11:30
>wake up at 6:30
oh fun
>dad fucking yells at you for not waking up fucking earlier!
hi, bye
I always wake up briefly a few hours before I'm supposed to wake up, feeling fantastic
ignore me, just passiing thru
then I go to sleep for an hour or two, and then I feel terrible
i'm up at 6 every day
every single day
like clockwork
You should do this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SPV9F5w7Ww
wait
he's giving you grief
for waking up at the CRACK OF DAWN?
......
he does it all the fucking time though
/me facepalms
That must be quite annoying for you Rain
I clean the rabbits "You are slower than the second coming!" which they say because they know I am agnostic
anything I do is returned with "Do fucking better!"
That's just mean
I push myself. They try to trip me up. They always have.
okay
there is one thing for pushing yourself
and another for impossible goals
you can't please everyone
I cook rice all the time
she says I have it too high on simmer
they point out flaws that dont exist
I got grief for not wiping up a few drops of tea
that landed on the stovetop whilst I was making it
that essentially turned into the entire stovetop
being scrubbed down and maintenance
I walk into their room and there is empty food bowls and trash everywhere! WTF!?
they have no room to talk down to me!
That's ok, everyone needs to vent once in a while :)
They both just... make my blood boil...
Bile slinging cunts is how I feel about them right now.
am i supposed to be seeing something here?
at least there are less chances you grow up and be a lazy good for nothing scumbag..........
:(
i wish i had more severe parents
when they found out that I was agnostic they said "Thats not how we raised you!"
agreed
. . . .
well
don't let it get to you
um
most of them
tons of them I'd guess
exactly
I know that. . .
I just wish they would show a little bit of pride in how much I push myself...
even if they dont deserve to say "I raised that kid"
When I do my chores I go a little slower than they would like... but only because I make sure I do the chore the right way... all they see though is me being lazy and good for nothing...
sorry about this...
Alright, take care Rain
hello
ok, later Rain
see you later Rain

again, there's no solid evidence that they are redacting Derpy yet.
