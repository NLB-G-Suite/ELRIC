Tovler1, what movie?
hell I can't even see all the constellations
Fluttershy already had the number prepared for the football
football is canon
notice that?
Derpy
How did that work? Aren't earth ponies stronger than pegasi?
the sky never gets even a dark blue
it stays dingy yellow
AJIsAwesome: The Bermuda Triangle (1978)

She knew AJ would win
DSNesmith, y u try to spy on Andromeda?

HAH!
moose
Lagg
I like how NO ONE notices except Apple Jack.
They're push ups, not wing-ups
:P
that is a longjump!
Chicks dig Rainbow
She is just using her natural talents
Fluttershy did wing-ups
I can't help but think that due to piracy, Rifftrax are now only doing Public Domain movies.
then I can learn to say aboot
Chicks dig RD
Now this one I wouldn;t count as cheating.
XD
So much cheating by RD:..
although it's really more like aboat
how do they fly? they are chickens!
*couldn't*
:D
Seriously. Are the spectator ponies blind?
Leadhoof, no one cares except for Apple Jack
and cheat
:p
heh
dirty cheating pegasus scum
I'd like to visit Canada some day
hax!
Vordox no, she's using her abilities to hr advantage

Should have set that rule at the beginning
Canadian_Brony: ...
and that's why I don't like rainbow
oh you've never been to canada?
I SAID: Oh oh
"Oh poo."

RD has wings. Automatically better than AJ
AND THIS EPISODE MADE ME hate RD

And then AJ summons The Listener to have Rainbow Dash assassinated
Algonquin especially

IM SO DRUNKL
eh...
XylemTube: your opinion
they have their own problems
liike moose?

NOW KISS

Turkeys are flightless anyway, waren't they?

Very fun :D <_<
I'm up
dem pinkie's girlish giggles

Dken2021, indeed. Rainbow Dash is now forbidden from flying, or breathing deep.
so, uh, avoid lakes

"Running for Eggheads"
42! TWILIGHT SPARKLE IS THE MEANING OF LIFE!
math makes you faster
yes
never understimate eggheads
That's the first time i've seen the 42. lol
but what I want are rocky-tier mountains
I have that book you know
Oh RD....lol

Laugh now RD, you will be an egghead soon

Dat title drop
so magic is answer to life
DAT TITLE DROP
I saw bonbon
lazy leaves
Twilight use Teleport :D
lazy, LAZY leaves
are best leaves
Keep in mind that the reason 42 was designated as the answer to life the universe and everything is because the people who asked Deep Thought didn't have a proper question.
im_a_dolphin: that would be cheating
but the times I've been to upstate, it's been neat
Quick_Thinker: no Friendship
What about the OTHER ponies in it?
Doesn't everyone want to win?
FUDGE
twilight can use her horn. insta-profit!

She probaby is, because horses don't kill their unborn like humans, so...
I honestly don't understand how RD thought AJ tripped her if she was ahead of her. :S
the rock and the stump were paid to wreck the race

I'd rather watch MLP, Robin.
Let all those who worship evil's might
Joker is a psycho....just like pinkie
batman's voice sounds like zero from megaman x7
Still say Spike Skull looks like Morte from Planescape Torment

You could take lessons from fucking BATMAN
wut?
52 was fun.
I know most of the lore pre-52, but I've been collecting them since
Probably the most I've ever read from DC>
Batman would be doing the fucking
Can Robin die?
wats the word 4 someone who works alot?
pony
wha-this is animated
Dr_Fumbles: nope
dat joker
CrimsonPhoenix: gotta say that was a right hard one, i only knew it cause i used to watch my elder cousin play it

Nope, it's relentlessly cheerful!

Everything else I've picked up from DC has just failed to interest me.

tSparx . . . oh
So cheerful
Justice League and JL UL?
Santa Tank
I have Blackest Night #1 and Rage of the Red lanterns signed by him
Canadian_Brony: Are you unfamiliar with animated Batman? There are like 5 shows.
santa tank?
just safari
Matt Seinrich dragged him along to megacon for the Robot Chicken panel
dafuqs that
wh ynot?
oh
Canadian_Brony: this is known as Batman The Animated Series aka TAS
for iphone?
tSparx I never got into it really.
i'm familiar with 60s batman...
The hell is going on?
errrerrrrerer
nice
that poor pony
Pyroid: Batman TAS
they continued it?
ah
Welp, I wanna go offline!
dem recorded claps
00,10what poor pony?
otakon figured. I've seen the NC review, but that's all I know about it really
I don't have anything signed by Johns, but I have Red Lantern 1 and New Guardians 1 signed by the artists
owloysius: they made another series called "The Batman" done by the people who animated Jackie Chan
the one he put antlers on
Sumica: That horse Joker put antlers on
otakon: The one with the deep voiced Joker?
Season 1 of The Batman was ok
This is one of my favorite Jokers :)
otakon: do you mean Jackie Chan adventures or something else?
iirc, Tomasi does the art for New Guardians?
dat crowd
Damn stream derp, I didn't know we were watching Batman! Oh wait, what am I worried about. I've seen this episode :D
ya
ouch
"Unless you speak about the bad game, Batman, Arkham Asylum/City, THEN it's easy
recorded voices
owloysius: yeah JCA
stealing! yea!!!

candy cane is op
I kinda miss those old Saturday morning cartoons as a kid...
ho ho ho

why don't they just spit out the candy canes?
Dr_Fumbles me too
i miss all that
lol
LOL
Y U NO EAT THE CANDY CANE? :S
00,10my guess is they are some how stuck
scout19_tf2: you and me both
otakon: i just thought that
otakon: Why didn't Pinkie Pie just tell everyone that parasprites are repelled by musical instruments?
otakon perhaps it's something along the lines of a gag
Kirkham
ah
otakon as in, it's impossible to spit out
mm
tSparx: Thats too non-pinkie
maybe badly played music enrages parasprites?
Batman TAS?! ...HUG ME, MODS!
tSparx: bc she's insane
recorded laughs
Maybe Joker should be transfer to another prison in another state
VenHur: no no, you hug mods
but the guardians have finally lost it and are creating the 3rd army, big event starting this/next month
otakon lowfn Both of those answers work here too :)
runs all 4 of the lantern books for 3 months
Whatever happened to that other show, Xia lin... something
trains and trains and trains and bridges
showdown?
oh snap
AlienWarhead: he keeps getting put into Arkham since he's insane
Well, except non-Joker, not non-Pinkie
I always wanted a model train set of my own.
Jingle Bells
lol
/me hugs the mods
its donder not donner
WOW waht a great song
:O
The fun has been doubled!
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that Arkham should be closed down.
The fun has just begun. Soon it shall be doubled.
For *terrible* security.
yeah, and I'm betting at least part of JL gets involved, in cameos at the least
so I'm guessing it's all the Corps vs. the Guardians?
As long at its doubled, I don't care when it begins
otakon there must be another insane asylem somewhere on their Earth
NO SHUT
tSparx: I think they have amazing security
MARK HAMILL FTW
yeah, it'll be crazy
hahahahah
ahaha
YOUR MOTHER?
Oh Joker, you bring a smile to my face

Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Ponyinabox - Daring Do and Doctor Whooves Shorts
Canadian_Brony, why did this remind you of Shrek 2?
Canadian_Brony: I really didn't see the point in the last movie.
twilight_sprinkle: The joker didn't die -- in fact, a lot of people have made fun of the fact that he should've gotten released along with everyone else in DKR
A firey steed... Twi, right! :$
*a point*
it just needed a needle to play
wow
3 was terrible, 4 was the worst but atleast it ENDED the series.
the next year, he went to Reis' stand again, and he recognized my friend
Rarity want's a high society prince and wonders why she ends up chasing Prince Doucebag
twilight_sprinkle: And I don't recall what you're talking about with the bandits.
CrinsomPhoenix: the fairy singed it
It was a buck because of how hard it is to find a needle
tSparx: how could he have survived that fall? plus he killed those people with the car bomb in the factory place
you need a good one too if you want it to sound good
OohShiny, I know she did
nice
Bai everypony. Have a nice day.
Canadian_Brony: True. 3 was bad, but 4 shouldn't evem had existed IMO.

so did they reveal what it'll be?
AlienWarhead: Nope

HoodyNinja: Add Shegorath and you got a masterpiece
ABOMB!
charlies fuphedd
they led the Reach to Odym, poisoned the Red Lantern battery, did something to Indigo-1, took Sinestro back as a GL to destroy his corps, sent something after the Star Sapphires, and brought back Orange's oldest enemy to try to kill him
the van is kaput
00,10that has to be an acheavment
Some days I just can't rid of a bomb
damn
they did reveal it
JESmith71: the VA's in arkham city, were the same from the series
SpadeMagnes[R]: MY MIND IS ON FIRE!
I checked Wiki after we last talked about this. Tara only did Arkham City
Derpy_Hooves, not harley
AlienWarhead: averted in this ep
Arleen Sorkin is Harley's VA. However, Tara filled in for her in Arkham City
Shizuka: I can't breath
I could totally picture this song in a spyro game :p
STATUE CRUSH
Derpy_Hooves: All but Harley Quinn's.
Shizuka: odd you bring up a shipping comic...but funny nonetheless
Ancient egyptians didnt joust
le gasp
FFFUUUUU
created from the guardian's bodies using the power of the first lantern, tied to their thoughts, no free will (biggest point), absorbs other beings to turn them into the same type of creature, which ejects their heart and wipes their mind, leaving only their eyes
oh jeez, the Guardians gotta be put down
sure harely sure
so innocent
Great idea....

lol
"This is how it ends, Joker. No big schemes. No grand fight to the finish with the Dark Knight. Tomorrow, all the papers will say that the great Joker was found, blown to bits in an alley, alongside a miserable little nobody. Kind of funny. Ironic, really. See, I can destroy a man's dreams, too. And that's really the only dream you've got, isn't it?"
HoodyNinja just keep a close eye on 'em. They're too young to be drinking.

HoodyNinja: I'm not sure their styles are really compatible. Remember Spider-Man supervillian supergroups? Didn't work so well, ever, period.
awww fuck
SpadeMagnes[R]: mental fixation on two
ah so thats where the giant penny is from, i had forgot
Not 20 dollar bills?

SpadeMagnes[R]: You know the phrase, "It's Pinkie Pie, don't question it"? It's the Joker, don't question it.
Joker is dissapoint
SpadeMagnes[R]: yes, yes he does
some lonely desperate soul attempting to get one going
Batman has a sense of humor?
I've never seen him laugh once
tSparx I just shorten it to "It's Pinkie Pie". That's all you really need.
is Robin even alive at this point?
she... giggled... at the ghosties
HoodyNinja: well still if you don't like her just tell her. You shouldn't let the whole "furry" thing throw you off there if you *do* like someone.
Batmans laugh is scary
he laughed in the last episode
oh boy
You haven't seen Batman & Robin, SpadeMagnes[R]?
lol
ah fuck
Canadian_Brony: I usually just say, "Pinkie"
when charlie scared joker
NO2!!!!!!
Actually, that doesn't count as canon for me.
tSparx: I told her I watched a show for little girls about ponies, and I think she's even more interested in me :/
dat phonebook
HAHAHAHAHAHA
LOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
wut?
but man
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
all those voice actors
KILL DA BATMAN
Unlimited POWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
HoodyNinja: well just tell her you're not interested is all
this is some of the most morbid laugher ever
HAAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHHA DIE BATS
So hwo did Joker kill Robin?
LOLOLOL
Sumica: if I may suggest, show the episode where Batman laughs, to show our viewers that Batman has a "sense of Humor"
suddenly Catwoman
HoodyNinja: you got lucky
suddenly catwoman
Cat Woman!
AHAHA AHAHAHAHA
CATFIGHT
otakon: It's not that, I was just reading and she started rubbing my head, plus i'm not good with relationship problems
catwoment saves him huh
It's Feline Female!
Isnt cat woman a bad guy? Girl in this case
I mean, what are Jennifer Hale and John DiMaggio doing at a Brony Convention?
SpadeMagnes[R]: he caught him and beat him up, and then blew up the building he was in
she's both
SpadeMagnes[R]: Chaotic neutral
or something like that
SpadeMagnes
fail locking system
SpadeMagnes[R]: Anti-heroine
Spades shes free lance sometimes good some times bad
SpadeMagnes[R]: she's more Neutral
The rock was still a better story
SpadeMagnes[R]: More chaotic good in TAS
SpadeMagnet[R] she goes back and forth a lot
She has a thing for batman doesnt she
hanging out?
ahahhaahahahahahahahaahahhaha
SpadeMagnes[R]: She's kind of both. SHe doesn't steal for profit somuch as a thrill... and he won't hurt the innocent.
You know, all the villains are able to put up a fight against Batman, so what if... they all teamed up?
for lolz
SpadeMagnes[R]: she's an Anti-Hero, much like Vegeta and Shadow the Hedgehog
Just to fight Batman
No one else
Haku they did
SpadeMagnet[R] Of course
it still fialed
HoodyNinja: hmmm well all I can say is treat it like any other girl showing interest in you. You get to know her, you don't think it would work then call it off.
[SWAG]Haku: I already tried that idea, got shot down
SpadeMagnes[R]: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingCatwoman
But what if they did it the right way?
PAWNCH
this is looking better than BronyCon >.>
otakon: I only have her in drama
dat tv tropes :D
HoodyNinja: hmm
website's MUCH better
whos seen the new batman movie
If they stopped acting like Comic Villains, they could kill him!
inb4 batman coming
Haku, Haku. Haku... Againt Batman, there IS no right way.
I have scout19_tf2
[SWAG]Haku: Then they wouldn't be comic-book villians
Hell, Joker had Batman on tv, why not unmask him?
BONDAGE!
is it cool
[SWAG]Haku: Ope, see, you answered your own question :P
Wait this just happened?
Oh hey, I missed the lottery; busy with life and all.
BONDAGE EVERYWHERE!
[SWAG]Haku: not his style
Wow thats fucking dark

[SWAG]Haku: "He's the Joker, don't question it."

A VERY BIG ROCK
Polydunami: it was Fight Club and The Day After Tomorrow
HOW DID BATMAN PREPARE THIS
batmans a spy
dafuq?
Dammit
A VERY BIG ROCK
I did not expect that
That Croc is a Spy
My screen froze

Ok just how the fuck did Batman prepare this
*click*
CANNOT ARREST!
lolz
ONLY JOKER!
Batman always has everything preapred
SpadeMagnes[R]: he's a genius
Next weekend, I'm away on the island.
EVERYONES A SPY
THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN!
Polydunami: have fun
SpadeMagnes[R]: He started a gettogether on meetup.com

I've seen this before, and Batman's such a good trickster that *I* didn't see that coming
Sounds nasty

You think I won't? I love it at that island.
rawr

Like a boss, Batman.
You Cat, I heard you like cats, so Im putting cats into your cats
tSparx: first time I saw it didn't see it coming.
Cat Ciao

mica
Batman has swag
lol
nah, fires are cool
00,10it's even earlyer for me
<_< Maybe
Here's another plan; its easy to trap batman. What if you just blew up the building? Even if you had some hencemen or your 'partner' in it, why not BLOW it up?
Batman, the vigilante that gets away with anything
but the spacing was not the best
"I'm not going to text you baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack!"
00,10it's 7 am my time
Chat: your collective lack of Batman knowledge disturbs me
Quick_Thinker: I grew up on it... god I looked forward on Fridays to new eps after school in the afternoon... too bad there's nothing like that nowadays

screen resolution is probably the biggest factor for performance, try turning that down a notch
Phase4, :< I has magics powahs of jynxing :P
AdamTheDuck: O.O
There's also anti-aliasing. Sucks up a lot of power, so that should be turned off as well
Well it's working again :D
Oh wow, dat lag
I always run TF2 on the lowest settings in a 1024xsomething window and my PC still gets damn noise when I play it :/

night Polydunami
:<*
yawn
It's nearly 3:00 AM. I should of een sleeping a hour a go :$
*been
Sleep is for the weak :3
wow really you had to say that
:P
need moar coffe
my god im tired
its like 3:56 over here
Silly people, you need to train your body to survive on low amounts of sleep.
it's almost like 3:00 am
yea but it 3 am over here
Pfft.
almost 9am
still awake
hello everyone/hey satrun did you get my mseeage
im still staying up late still
hi Flutterchu
Hello flutterchu
DashWithRainbows: WAY ahead of you on that one :P
Hey flutterchu
orly?
yup
done a week of no sleep yet Ponies47?
No caffiene either.
Now that's just unhealthy :P
so my fanfic has been cancelled so im workig on a new one
Yep, too bad I still done it :3
wow dashwithrainbow just wow
if I done it for another week, I would run the risk of dying. 3-4 days without sleep causes you to have hallucinations.
Best week of my life.
:|
i need food !
DashWithRainbows: Nopr. Most I've done is 36 hours :$
*nope
my fanfic is about Tord going to equestria
Ponies47 I guess your body knows its limits then.
It took me 3 hours to actually fall asleep on that week.
DashWithRainbows: BUCK THAT (squee)! I'm going to change that! :D
Don't say I didn't warn you.
lolz
DashWithRainbows: i havnt slept in 11 day's so i wont be argueing
Also, it's best to do it when you have a week of nothing planned.
lol 11 days
Otherwise, school and other things will just wreck your energy supply.
school is boring
DashWithRainbows: Oh like when I did the 36 hour thing? Everypony keept on telling me to go to bed. I didn't listen and 36 hours later. I crashed. HARD :S
why do you have so many windows at once
why the depressing music Phase4 ? :(
Because he wants people to have feels.
Or he just likes the song.
can't blame him.
Don't even get me started on how many times I have almost fell alseep in school -_-
Ponies47: me neither
I like it, it's just I was in such a good mood :/
Ponies47 English class, form tutor is my English teacher. She was known to be the most boring teacher in the school.
heh i did that a couple times at my school to dude
I fell asleep pretty much every lesson.
tell me about it... Friday, the last 2 school hours, Politics and Economy, with the most boring Teacher, who can't make anything sound interesting even if he tried (and he doesn't) ... so many people fell asleep
teachers are boring
i was just trying to be hush now quiet now it's not my fault im tear drop
Good... um, its night time here, so I guess it is good night?
I think school is just plain out boring. I hate every single moment of it. My mom says that highschool are the best 4 years of your life. You know what I say to that? BULL(Squee)
You'll regret saying that later in life.
:D
I miss being in Year 9.
POnies47: High school was fun; wait till you graduate to feel it.
And right now, I'm in my second year of sixth form.
CHERISH YOUR CHILDHOOD.
DashWithRainbows: I am a freshman
I have no idea what that is.
Freshman is a 9th grader
or the last theory lessong we had before we could finally start making actual work... 4 horurs of streight up pushing information into us via a Presentation... wwe call it mannheimer Funnel
Being English and being part of its educational system.
i think that every school in the world need to turn into a live video games instead of doing other stuff you know
when i graduated high school i didnt feel anything but "FINALLY"
I assume 9th grader is basically year 9 or year 8.
DashWithRainbows: Year 9
Ah. Yeah, seems about right.
and i still dont miss my high school, and i never will.
The only thing I miss are the friends who weren't douchbags.
also, brb.
i hate my school so much it gets me into trouble alot and it makes me upset all the time cause i casued so much dramma in school
Pfft. I didn't have any friends in middle school and seems like the same thing iss going to happen for high school :|
*is
Hey guys
Hello wowviewer
Hey wowviewer
what
i only had 2 friends in high school and i didnt care about the others
no hate, i just didnt care about them
Talking about high school, huh? :S

Hmm, think I'll play some PF2 for a bit before my morning walk.

I didn't like school in general before college. Not much friends :S
I just want be like my dad. Go to high school and just do my work finsh and GET THE BUCK OUTTA THERE! He says high school sucked and he just wanted to move on and be a adult.
well you know what guys school is for chumps just throwing it out there
high chool wouldve been nicer if there werent so many pointless classes i had to take
/me hugs twilight_sprinkle
/me hugs Pearly :)
Actually, I thought I wouldn't like high school either, but my good friend actually made it worth while

:p
dos attacks?
00,02Denial of Service
what's this?
D:
00,02talk about Denial of Service
Yay lets participate as victims!
it's longer then 10 minutes :D
21/9/12
it'S to busy the target adress so much that it cant process real requests anymore. denial of service
Wow, it's been a while since I was here
Hey Evil_Spike
dat south park
Hi gabe
00,02Dark_Horst, thats the 'layer 4' attack
00,02throw so much traffic at it you exceed its capacity
Evil_Spike: Except you're not here. This is a dream. You are going to wake up and believe whatever you want to believe.
21/9/12
/me shall learn tonight
Phase4: the 4chan "hacker's" favourite attack
JRP: the season 3 premere
JRP: Quit spamming, it hasn't been anounced yet
00,02Dark_Horst, yeah, they talk about that in this talk
I don't think
aaaand there they are
I'll laugh if I was right
Anonymous are awesome
what the fuck is this
don't know
Phase4: whats this vid called?
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
There is the date
00,02"DEFCON 19: Three Generations of DoS Attacks (with Audience Participation, as Victims)"
thanks
Unknown
Well, at least they don't treat "Anoymous" as a secret hacker group.
Because that's silly.
Lies
Kammerjunk: that's becasue this guy probally actually knows what he's blabbering about
Yup.
00,02this is a talk at defcon
I'm liking this Th3j3st3r
00,02everyone there understands whats going on :P
"skilled" Yup.
Phase4 you know the date
00,02i know the what now?
I love them
pbs?
what the fuck is this some presentation at the whitehouse
fucking kids
Feel free to message me I'm bored x3
Goverment websties are corrupt
00,02flutterchu, no, defcon talk
Sort of a US Government owned TV station, but all the shows are viewer-supported
Er, not station, network
I know nothing about coding... :(
^
But I'm happy that some people are addressing the problem of anonymous fucking around the web
If anything happend to bronystate I would cry :(
don't worry
this is a terrible and funny presentatoin
it's not the season yet
MLP_Brovakiin, the website has been DDOS'd during episode premiers before.
fun times
Cans.wave.
MadSurge: Nope, I only found out about broynstate 6 weeks aago
00,02Kandarihu, to be fair normal trafic during an episode is like a ddos
wow
00,02its gona get worse next seasion
this network is pretty hardy
if the web app doesn't work use a regular chat client
That voice... it's like listening to a tech-savvy Rush Limbaugh.
00,02been working hard to stop that, should have no downtime for season 3 if everything goes ok
hey have you ponies herd of radio graffiti?
that dosent hate you
like 3000+ people are going to tune in for season 3?
00,02we had 10k viewers for the end of season 2
STOP HITTTING BACK flutterchu
wow
10k
00,02its not going to be a smaller number for the start of season 3
20k?
I have this funny mental image of the mods standing arounf the bronystate servers with fire extingishers on premere nights :D
the chat will be speedy during season 3
25k.... now thats a lot tuning in
wants to learn about computers no math skills
00,02dont think we'll get that many but it doesnt hurt to be capable of that
Dat pic :D
^
00,02Ihop, you can get away without math usualy, you need to know the basic stuff of course
._.
The thing is, ponies from all over the planet want to see the premiere... but unless you have actual access to the HUB (which I do, yay) your only resource is ann online stream. And we're one of the more popular.
Mac OS, windows, and linux all at the same time
As the community grows, so do the amount of bronies who just can't wait for the latest YouTube version. SO...
00,02he's gona fumble around with this for a bit
00,02vmware has broke on him
In other words, as sensible as it may be for that guy in Madagastar on a 56K line with an old laptop to wait-- he wants it NAO.
You know this video by heart, Phase4?
tfw you joind ponys to watch it burn from start to finish
00,02MadSurge, not really, just seen it before
that looks like a hack
00,02its a denial of service attack
00,02blocks clients
oh well to me it is
Bored :3
^
00,02LEARN
00,02:<
a hack is an invasion of a foreign system. a dos is just throwing shit at a system
im famous
im gonna go to bed bye
:(
Goodnight flutterchu
I don't wanna learn, but I respect Phase4 for being able to understand this :$
i like learning
lol windows 8
gotta try that
00,02windows 8 is vulnderable to this too
00,02its bizare
cool
well, microspft
fuck
thy probably leave that loophole unplugged on purpose
I SEND ME LAPTOP TO GET FIXED IT AND GET IT BACK TO FIND THEY DID DIDLEY DICK
00,02one day i want to get something on ms's network and run that attack
WAT A BLOODY JOKE
we all know they want to controll what they sell
00,02JRP|temp, LESS CANTERLOCK PLS
im so mad
So this Router Advertisement attack is really something that can't be used against distant websites?
00,02Kandarihu, its 'link local', can only be used on the local network segment
toshiba can suck my nutr
00,02basically not past a router
I see.
I guess that's why Microsoft doesn't really care.
00,02its not hard to fix, infact it could probably be fixed by a 3rd party
00,02this guy is from cloudflare, we use them for bronystate
lulzsec is weird
00,02ohai pony_9568
Question, when's the rerun of "Canterlot Wedding"?
Hey all.

cludflare

00,02scout19_tf2, technically not a mod :P
scout19_tf2: With great difficulty.
00,02i'm a tech, work on the site
cruising on Kickstarter... a Homstcuk game... already reached the Goal of 700.000$ after 4 days -.-
do u sign up or is it site picked
sad
00,02scout19_tf2, i wrote a greesemonkey plugin for the site, talked with the mods, eventually i started helping out with the site
yeah its on youtube, too...
Phase4: So your prefix means techie. But Shizuka's the tech lead, isn't she?
But Iwould watch it in 3 hours though
00,02shizu is tech lead yeah
Oh? I didn't know tha.
that*
do u guys get paid
00,02i love how people didnt really have a problem with lulzsec until they attacked minecraft
00,02its great the world works that way
and the freaking Cheetaman II The Lost Levels game got funded >.<
scout19_tf2: They're paid in love and harmony.
yea thats the best kind of money there is
you buck with minecraft, thats when you cross the line XD
hey phase wut server were u guys useing earlier i was lookin for it so i just started playin anyway

/me noms on Ihop
ahhhhhhhh

I wonder if Th3j3st3r could even take down thepiratebay. (not that I'd want him to)
captain router
/me Eating a gigant warm sandwich with ham and cheese , yummy
00,02Kandarihu, he'd probably have trouble, the slorris attack is most effective against apache due to the way it works
I see
00,02lighthttpd is somewhat better against it (thats what piratebay uses) and nginx is even better again
man i hate not knowing things
the hell is that sound
Oh its the Dayz Mod to minecraft?
I think
da fuq
And this is...
Oh, mods. You so silly.
MineZ
Thehell is th3j3st3r

:(
I'll die soon from boredom
What the HAY is THIS?

00,02Kencolt, the guy we're seeing is invisible

Yeah someone told me it before :p

I'll brb I'm geeting somthing to drink
You know someone should stream Tribes: Ascend sometime

Heya SafariMonkey :)
Be right back
hello MaxTheBrony

AdamTheDuck:

05Phase4: oh wait 2x GTX580

00,02Really nice
05need more memory though
051 of my mem cards are gettign a bit worno

Wrek: do you have a linux partition, or just windows?
05only windows rigth now
05hoping to switch to linux once steam adn my fav games work on it
05like fully
Wrek: http://www.memtest.org/
05not via wine
05thats not what i meant with halp SafariMonkey
Wrek: Oh
sorry
so, scootaloo doesn't got a sister?
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-scootaloo.jpg
xD
05not canonically
what's mean canonically?
HIYA everypony
Hey Bronysith
05it means "It has not been shown or explained in the show, so we dont know."
time for Shadow of The Colossus
<3
Scootaloo needq an episode
:(
APPLEJACK NEEDS A SONG
needs* >_>
xD
thats the most top priority right now
yup
applejack don't have a song?
nope
:O
y? cause ONE TIME CHARACTERS HAD THEIR OWN SONGS BEFORE APPLEJACK
please, i can read, so don't use shift/capslock
:)
05what?
haha :p
Wrek how's the Viking pony comming along?
nothinng...
Bronysith: Damn right she does!
05Sonny: havent continuedo n it today
ok
Bronysith: It seems to me that 4 of he mane 6 have their own songs: All but Apple Jack and Rainbow Dash
SafariMonkey: um
rainbow dash had her own song
it was a duet with fluttershy
No she had a duet I think
that's not her own song, is it?
in which episode?
not really he
Scottish_Brony: yes it is
applejack`: May the best pet win, that one
ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
yup
:)
Bronysith: I guess that conts, she had lead part
if someone else is singing with them, it's not really their own song
SafariMonkey: what do you mean you guess? OF COURSE IT COUNTS
05ok Phase4: i burned memtest to a CD
05gona boot from it next time i reboot
like "at the gala" that pretty much would include everypony
so yeah
I hope she get a own song
Scottish_Brony: it is about her, and it is her song
so whos the better joker nicholson or ledger
Wrek: Good idea
Ledger Imo
:)
MaxTheBrony: I think if she doesn't the community will make one
Sonny: Not their own song though
yeah maybe :)
Heath Ledger caught the darker side of the Joker
SafariMonkey: you got a point there
no shuit
SafariMonkey: Still think they'll do it tough
Find a pet is a duet of fluttershy and rainbow dash
they share it
it is THEIR song
their own song
ye but it isn't about them is it?
It's about the pet for Rainbow dash
/me facehoof
Bronysith: By that logic, yu could say applejack shared in at the Gala
Sonny: it is about rainbow dash
yup
Sonny: the song is about rainbow dash finding a pet
Bronysith: yes her pet that is
indeed
so it is about rainbow dash
about a thing she does, not who she is or somthing personal
wich I think can't be included as 'the song of Rainbow Dash'
They all had their own verses in 'at the gala' but that doesn't count as a whoel song
Apparently you fail Phase4 :D
00,02yeah, that seems to be the general consensu
00,02consessus';
00,02i cant spell
MLP_Brovakiin: I was saying that
00,02applejack`, dont use me tl learn how to spell
by that logic Sonny then cheerliee has had her own song before applejack
did she sing?
nope
oh god
but the song is about her so she it is her song
LOGIC!
well then it's her song
send me a link :p
what Phase4 ?
(private)
me?
00,02yeah
nono Bronysith
i need to set some shit on fire
SafariMonkey: Sorry I was just AFK for a couple of seconds and didn't see you say that
Wrek: any ideas on what i can set fire to?
MLP_Brovakiin: It's fine. :)
banana xD
nice name for a demoman
:p

/me huggles Bronysith, Sergio_Scriptor, AdamTheDuck, MLP_Brovakiin and Random
Ohai PillowPoni !

Bronysith : Basically, "SWAG" is just another bullshit word that people copy because they're hiding their own self..
/me and fluffs
/me Glomps PillowPoni :)
Haaaaaai PillowPoni
So anyways, yesterday i decided to visit my old school from last year which has kdis from 5th grade to seniors and there was a poster for 5th grade elections and it said "Who should be mayor of SWAGville?" i am dead serious
max how do you do that?
I still have no idea what swag means :D
Also guys please i asked this already 4 times,no one knows what the b Movie is ? :|
Its a pun :D
AdamTheDuck: the correct term is stolen loot
Random write /me and then waht you want to say
/me wiggles from under MaxTheBrony and Jmo
AdamTheDuck: the wrong term is sex appeal
oh k
Bronysith : Go back and rip the poster off, spray it with deodorant and burn it in front of 5th grade
/me test
Notlob is the best town :D
this is a cool surf map
Bronysith, I've only heard it in crush kill destroy sway and in the phrase "ponyswag"
MasterChief: the fact that little kids use the term SWAG pisses me off, little kids shouldnt be saying "I HAVE SEX APPEAL" thats how they get molestered
finland is the best meme almost:D
Bronysith: im prety sure they dont know what swag means :P
Bronysith : "it's trendy nowadays". But in reality this is a method of making all kids "like" the same terms, beliefs and ideas.
:P muffinz :D

00,02so in a way yes but mostly no
Phase4: wut?
As my fellow Glenn Beck fans tend to joke: An announcement of an announcement has been anounced.
CODE FOR 1999: 9:3 = 3 = C. The 1 is a leftover so we'll leave it alone. 1= A. And 6+6+6 added to the quantity of 6 = 21 = T........It says....... CAT!!!!!
CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT

It's kind of sad how much Twilight wants the princess's approval.

Wrek: they would allow weapons at a gala?
Also, What's ironic is that it's 9:30 am now, and they are playing this episode, which takes place during the night.

AdamTheDuck: :D
DocSane: I do agree but what can you do
thanks guys
We back now!
blueblood fail
DocSane: instead of being ignored for 2 years?
DocSane: the whole finale was just inconsisnte, especially part 2, they just shoehorned in a song and fight scene, the fightscene was pointless, considering CELESTIA IS THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN OPEN THE DOOR to the elements
Celestia really is a very light pink, isn't she?
XD

I'll catch you yet my dears
Fluttershy is best desperate pony
It's not.... float, but there's a ball on it
I like her mane

balls
A kid who lacks the gross motor skills to handle a jug needs practice.
un amused
Wrek: what do vikings drink anyways?
greeen hooooooooooooves
poor hayseed has no cutie mark :(
It does sound useful for kids like the ads said, no spills or having the parents pour everything for them until they learn how to do it themselves
Bronysith: he hasn't worked on it yet
ow...
Ow ow ow
I like RD's hair in this episode

It's 22:00 here now.
NOT AGGGGGAIIIINNNN :l
Bronysith: nope
Anyone here an english major?
Tori Spelling incoming
I need to look that mystery episode ove again. If the contest were held in a city far from Canterlot and Ponyville, that would make sense out of everything.
ill be back after i murder some innocent Colossi
Vocal minorities ruin everything
DocSane: your new to this arent you?
weee
Bronysith: There has only been 2 :|
Yay :)

MLP_Brovakiin: one of them has to be worst, therefore 2nd is worst
Bronysith they had it coming
sandwich

Bronysith: True
blarrrrg
So who has their windows open to other pony forums and EqD's news emails and plan on posting the airdate everywhere if they show an ad?
ok everyone keep your eyes close for S3 previews :P
YES!!! IT'S TEN AM!!!
DocSane: return of harmony was the season 2 premire
00,10twi magicaly fixing the cake
I feel like i don't need to have the HUB on my TV right now. but i do anyways
4 pm in italy
Remember guys. If we see an ad for S3, there will be spoilers. Everything other than the date will be a secret kept among those of us watching at the time.
So i'm planning on committing suicide. Anyway i know that's the way i'll go. I guess I can wait til shoew's over.
Actually 10 pm here in Manila, Fillyppines.
Hey guys :)
i feel more alive at 10:00 am
rdibp: It was produced as part of season 1 and is thematically the bookend to Mare in the Moon.
hello BronyInstrumental
that sonic rainboom was WAY TO FAST
Hello BronyInstrumental :)
Best three songs ever? (BBBFF, This days aria and Love is in bloom?)

Hey BronyInstrumental
Hello BronyInstrumental
rdibp: Lesson Zero is the actual premiere of season two because it changes the format of the show
im feeling again
Your brother you never talk about
:O
Ceilingpand: nope, best song is Smile, Second is Winter Wrap Up, then Becoming Popular
9:02 MO USA
DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUUUN
sometimes i wish season 3 was really the last because i can end my pathetic existence sooner
dun dun duuuuun
00,10yes twi we are as shocked to hear about your brother as you were
I wasn't.
Indeed
Damn spoilers.
quite
now im going to keep feeling and drown on the floor in my own feels
Well almost all of us ninjazz...
rdibp: You can tell that Return of Harmony was part of season one because it still has the season one opening credits.
DocSane: alright, think whatever you want to think.....
OohShiny - Would probably never decide, had to say it though since I like the songs :P
FRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAANDDDDDDDDDS
commercialssssss
if i had a dollar for everytime MLP season 2 was inconsistent, i would have so much money
Discord is still the best villian
Dat commercial.
PONIES
DocSane, indeed. And Return of Friendship is the real end of Season 1 because it called back to all the letters that Twilight Sparkle wrote to Princess Celestia.
XylemTube: yup and chrysalis is worst
THIS ALREADY PLAYED
fruit juice fountain??
oh ponies
TOLIET
MLP
10 am in New York, 7 am in San Fransico.
they must have went on 4chan then
CHRYSALIS IS WORST VILLAIN
been there, dun dat
Hey Sumica (Or another mod in here), I'm sure you're ready to add the airdate as front page news here if we learn it today right?
if i had a dollar for every time a so-called fan trashes season 2 I would be the richest man alive
rdibp: It's not what I think. It's what it is. It was held back till the start of season 2, but it was always the season 1 finale.
dissapering bears?
NO SPOIL ITS OK
Bronysith trolololo
coco beans
That is no chocolate that is shit :)

GLOWWWWWWWW

XylemTube: No, I agree.
DonSane: now that you put it that way....fine
XylemTube: season 2 finale was rushed

bbbsf
I am actually banned from ponies by my dad, and I am in Incognito mode with the stream muted.
So close yet you never mentioned him before
/me sings along
i love this song, so cute <3
Good thing i can't see the stream, no spoilers for me :)
Sumica: Its to keep the viewership up
00,10Filly Twi is soooo cute
daww fily twi
:'( MY BIG BRO IM CRYING
pony_1334: Get headphones
:)
Your dad don't allow youto pony?
daw
Sumica: /)
pony_1334: Why not put in headphones so you can hear the audio?
Any filly is pretty damn adorable.
oh well
I don't have headphones.
O swag were hosting the Royal wedding again! :D
Sumica: suddenly it feel like South Park. Waiting for the terrence and philip trailer
:)
That way you can watch the stream without him knowing
How are you banned from ponies?
But Twi has the priviledge of hopping around with her BBBFF. Which is pretty damn adorable.
Oh Shines, you fruit!
Oh
yeah sure, never had a single fight
i hear "fly okay"
i bet 50 bits in how we are not going to get any sort of revelation about S3 when the royal wedding part 2 ends :) anyone wants to counter-bet me ? :P
this is why Friendship is magic is the most awesome kids tv show ever.
all backround fillys look the same in this show
:'( my brother cried when i showed this to him i did to
00,10she missed him so much she forgot about him due to the emotonal trama
If you're really against shows being supported by advertising, I hope you don't mind paying upwards of $500 a month for your cable bill, with U.K.-style licensing fees for broadcast TV.
this is easily the best song of the finale
i dont think we will get any info either
bye BronyInstrumental
:(
I haz no big bro :'(
/me harmonizes.
All of the 3 S2 finale songs are good in their own way.
I haz big sis
flutteryay: cried because of the song or cried because of its meaning?
Because in the element of Applejack, he thinks it is gay and inappropriate.
I find allof the mane 6 fillys adorable apart from fluttershy, her legs are to long for some reason :/
:'(
nah This day Aria is better
Suddenly notice the force field around Canterlot.
JT: nope
oooh

My personal favorite is at the Gala
Maybe FS has a big brother too?
DFF
dat squee
everytime i see somebody say they hated an episode i feel like it's a sin if i do like it
Kandarihu: I remember reading that cable TV was originally advertised with the lack of ads. Ads were added later
cried because it reminds me of my brother who is GONE i cant see him anymore
the way twilights back leg rotates in the end of that song.
Java I hope she has a family
bff= brony friends forever
/me hugs flutteryay
Still feels odd Season 3 isn't showing next week though. I mean four episodes, three of them being the Season Finales back to back
/me thanks
Can't cut the grass: too wt. So, I'm back as SafariMonkey
Rarity only now realizes how important Twilight's family is.
flutteryay: how did you show him this then?
Seems like a perfect lead-in to start a new season
Well spike....
Or maybe she got disowned because she moved to Ponyville :(
and then they rofl

Disco in the bath tub. What will we invent next...
TUB LIGHT
actualy i would buy that only for the tub light :)
Hair dryer in the bath tub?
only on the hub.
1334: No, I don't think Applejack's element was a sentient redneck.
A rather un-impressive line up.
pony_1334, I don't hate your parents. Not understanding is not a crime.
Sergio_Scriptor: I don't have a tub
PONIES

So why "for Ponies' Sake"?

PillowPoni|Phone: Don't make me slap you. Animated ONLY!!!!!!! Bay is a travesty.

Upcoming ass shaking
rdibp: But...it was Robo With a Shotgun

Java, okay
pony_1334: I take it your dad doesn't care about the fact that the people who work on the show like the fanbase (Like he wouldn't care about the positive stuff de Lancie, Lauren, or what Tara and the VAs say about the fanbase)
dat face...
00,10uh no that would not be Java
She says that while we've NEVER heard of him before.

And then Cadance realized she'd hooked up a brother and sister

Well, the whole point of Starship Troopers is that the humans overreacted to an asteroid that left an asteroid belt billions of years ago, so the humans committed an unjust war. If the Heart of the Swarm expanstion renders the Zerg mostly harmless to Terrans and Protoss, THEN it would be like Starship Troopers

British TV ads are better than this by far.

AlienWarhead: No, she did a long distance teleport in Dragon Quest.
oh god
DAT FAIL AD
Kids don't know how to keep their eyes closed.
who is the dance pony?
TUB LIGHT
DocSane: she can teleport through rock, but one of the first laws of teleports is to think of the place where you want to go, and materialize on your mind
I lived through that. It hardens the kids to pain!!
"slip" it on >>
Axel_Dash: sumica's OC :)
Tailsy, what ads?

05btw sumi
THAT'S WHAT EYESBROWS ARE FOR

Hard to admit but the queen changeling is adorable. Ish!
Just send her to the caves now
While the Queen explains her plain, Celestia could have just blasted her
all ponies are just wathcing like nothing is happening
Celestia doesn't give a fuck
Actually, Late, Princess Celestia was the only one to react afterwords.
Twilight_Sparkle[NLR: True

Oh man Nydas worms, those things are SO much fun to make in this game!
Hey, MadSurge. Starcraft 2 replay.

PinkiePry, it says Fabulous.
Hi Ninjazz and thelonepony!
PinkieSpice*
Welcome back MadSurge :)

Hey MLP_Brovakiin!
Ninjazz: oh, i thought it would say" Whinging? You call that whining? Now this is whineing~"
I see... Gold_Demona? Staying with us for a bit before your trip?
PinkieSpice, THAT is a BETTER Ideeeeaaaaa.
Hey guys
MadSurge: I wouldn't really call it a trip. Just going to my mom's house to hang out. :P
Hello YourLittleDashie
hi YourLittleDashie :)
00,10yeah I see alot of stuff not making it to live
Hello YourLittleDashie
Gold_Demona: I bet your mom is a cool lady as her daughter :D
I'm listening to Azekahh read "Sweet Apple Massacre"
05YourLittleDashie: and you do this to yourself... why?
MadSurge: lol, yeah she's pretty cool. At any rate going to her house doesn't feel like a chore. XD
11,02Moo o.o
Is that one of *those* fics?
Gold_Demona: is she very far away?
Also hi SuperBrony64! MOO
Ohi SuperBrony64
05Wirisme: its nothign but gore and incest and rape
11,02^_^
Hey, SB.
I see :|
Hello SuperBrony64 :)
05and i see no reason to read it
Wrek: Sweet Apple Masacre isn't that bad. Honestly, it's just overloading the reader with violence with no corralation
Me neither
05YourLittleDashie: that is my point
11,02Hai :3
why are we watching this?
05theres no reason to read it
00,10YourLittleDashie, that is the defenition of bad
05cause its jsut that
Hey super. :D
I see. So the Starship Troopers comparison is purely logistical.
PinkieSpice: Why not?
MadSurge: Nah, she's just in the next county. Forty minute trip on the interstate.
Wrek: I'm just bored :|
That's a relief.
Sumica: LOL
We watching an MLG game?
not a fan of starcraft
Gold_Demona: ah, a little less than a visit trip to my grandma
Apparently, there is a fanfic that is truly terrible: Momma Fluttershy
00,10DerpyMuffins, you do know what MLG is right?
Yea why?
05Kandarihu: logistical?
Dat SuperBrony64.
I have no idea what MLG stands for
YourLittleDashie: I would rather sit in perfect silence being exetremely bored then read that
00,10MLG Game, think about that
11,02YourLittleDashie: Sounds like what the remake of Halloween did.
except for my little game
MLP_Brovakiin: LOL
SuperBrony64: pm
I actually wrote a grimdark fanfic... and it sucks
YourLittleDashie, Terrible how?
CrimsonPhoenix: IDK
YourLittleDashie: try to rework it into a parody of grimdark :D
Oh wait. Momma Flutteshy. Diaper fic.
Ninjazz: Like Pattycakes?
Ninjazz: Eww pony poo
YourLittleDashie, Yeah?
>Dark, Mature, Pregnant Fluttershy
I heard a description of CC, it just made me feel really sorry for RD
Ooooh.
meh
Nvm.
I'd rather read Cupcakes than read a Diaper Fic
Diaper fic?
Back
Can't we just stick to shipping instead?
how do i regester my nickname
That's much better alternative.
Imo.
no streaming at the moment?
oh ok
Here is the grimdark fanfic that I wrote: http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7465367/1/Scootabuse
YourLittleDashie: NO :|
Ninjazz, Green has updated and closed in the first arc
WARNING: IT SUCKS
SuperBrony64: mooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
I thought that kind of stuff wasn't allowed here
Sorry, no non-image links during stream
00,10oh so you want a ban then YourLittleDashie?
hey SuperBrony64 , gusse what new game I got. :D
Sumica: OH NO PLZ I'LL FIND SOMETHING BETTER
He didn't read the rules, 'pparently. Not surprised.
Uhhm
CrimsonPhoenix, Green? What about Blue?
PinkieSpice: oooh tell me too!
11,02PinkieSpice: New Super Mario Bros. 2? :D
Whatever I'm not going to the dark side
Ever
SuperBrony64: nooope~
Ninjazz, because it
11,02btw, the global coin total has surpassed 93,356,624,789 :3
CrimsonPhoenix, Ah. IT...
because it's based on the episodes Green Isn't your color
YourLittleDashie: bye bye
00,10we barely tolorate talk of it we sure as hell dont want links to fics
SuperBrony64: i'll give you a hint, people wish there was a easy mode for it
05read "that kind of fics" sumica?
Uhm... READ MY LITTLE DASHIE ITS THE BEST
SuperBrony64: I yet have to see if collecting all these coins affects the gameplay in any way :D
What kind of fics Sumi reads Wrek?
YourLittleDashie: okay. :U
-_-
/me reads into YourLittleDashie soul
05DerpyMuffins: i dunno
YourLittleDashie, Background Pony is better
inb4 he doesn't do that.
Be careful doing that PinkieSpice
I'm only following YourLittleDashie suggestion
how do i regester my nickname here
SuperBrony64: I was recently given a copy of Dark Souls~
MadSurge: Nah it just changes the title screen
PinkieSpice, on PS3?
yep
Neato
Heyo, Rarityhater.
05my little dashie fic is decent. but you can see that it tries very much to jsut be drepressingly sad. i appreciated it for waht i t was. but its completly overated in the community. good fic. sligthly overated. there's worse otu there
Its a used copy though
what class are you going to roll in?
JESmith71: Piles and piles and piles of coins :D
05movign on
Dat Scoot-Scootaloo
OH NO! Did I miss the season 2 finale? :O
05Scoot-Scootaloo! SHIT
And a Mario statue if you get a million
05HIDE THE MLG
I have to admit it worked though
Wrek: *claps*
Scoot-Scootaloo: yes. you did
Needs more wub wub wub to be truly MLP, Wrek.

00,03Oh mornin' y'all~
SuperBrony64, you've never even played Dark Souls

The only use I have for my gamepad is for platformers and console emulators
I can't remember
00,03MLG. You're watching MLG things without me...
05i didnt lie earlier Scoot-Scootaloo
Osnap.
Scoot-Scootaloo: Blame Wrek
why can we watch something eles? like gameplay of Team fortress 2?
or skyrim?
Wrek: I'm sorry my birthday presents didn't meet your expectations :'(
00,03Oh I get it, you thought I wouldn't be here this morning so you sneaked in some MLG things...
or watch SuperBrony64 play something?
/me is playing skyrim
05sorry PinkieSpice, i think i heard you wrong. you complainign about the stream?
05also MadSurge: dont get me wrong
:U
05the game in istelf is fantastic and i couldnt be happier
/me stops channeling his inner rarity
05but i cant play it casue they fucked up the port
05like ALWAYS
Dovah: Same, high five!

PinkieSpice: I got like 59 of those things :P
00,03Where are all the 360 N0 SC0P3ZZ?
Dovah: I have pleny of regular, but only one flawless
Wrek: I'll stop complaining =_=
00,03I used to love that video :$
00,03BOOM Headshot!
05CrimsonPhoenix: it took the original starcraft ages and many patches to become as balanced as it is today. personalyl i enjoy sc2's competitive play alot more myself. the originals contains a lot of nostalgia sure. as for singleplayer i enjoyed sc's more. mainly cause you got it all at once. now they split it up too much and made it dull for the singplelayers.
And the fact that they're taking so long to get the expansions out doesn't help. =/
05dat silence i caused
yay my name is now regestered
Goold Demonaa~
Jmooo~

My interest in HoTS died a few months ago. ;~;
Hello DaringDerpy

So, did Marathon ever get referenced in Halo?
I cant remember the last time I slept more than 3 hours
Gold_Demona: i have that problem too normally, just not today :) i feel refreshed
They were useful.
Eli: That's awesome. :)

00,03Dual pistols are for people of the Major Leagues :)
1) hold TicTac-Box above your mouth , step 2) open box, step 3) eat all!
jhg: the tic tacs weren't posted by Lil_B ...
Wouldnt you choke on them all, Lil_B? :p
SpeedyBolt: nope. there aren't enough in one box

Hi Ponies47 !
LOL, Wrek, was that their Three Stooges impression?
I'll never play with Wrek... he kills friend when they are in his way...
Lil_B say whaaaaaaaaaa
You're in my way sit!
*sir
Wrek is just Kratos.
Kills everything that gets in his way
I have no stream. What is wrek playing?
Well, I need to go
cachi01|phone: seems like an old N64 game
cachi01|phone: Marathon
run you fol run
00,03cachi01: MW3
Ohai Scoot-Scootaloo
Marathon MW3 lolwut
00,03yo~
Oh you Scoot-Scootaloo!
Bye everypony!
Bye Joy!
cachi01|phone: Marathon :D
Scoot-Scootaloo: even tho MW3 reminds me of an old N64 game, this isn't it
Later Joy
00,03Joy is leaving? :'(
and hi Scoot-Scootaloo
MadSurge which one?
cachi01|phone: no idea
no more Joy?
We are Joyless. :<
00,03Joy has left the chat ;_;
bye Joy
We no longer have Joy
:(
now everyone is depressed... or at least "Meh"
Or both
i'll never feel joy again... ok now it's getting weird...
Meh.
/me Sighs
Scoot-Scootaloo
Joy was best CVharaacter in Pokemon
Character*
/me Plays a sad song
Nurse joy
Ftw
Officer Jenny, dudes
Secre- oh fuck. lol
/me gets a knife
/me starts cutting an apple
I wanted to make a "Zombie" CD to listen too in my Car, so far I have 7 Songs from L4D2, but there still is so much space left on the Disc... what to put on?
So what is the point of this game?
you thought i was going to murder someone.didnt u bronystate
Put Winter Wrap Up on it, and troll everybody that you drive by.
Lil_B: "There's a Zombie on the Lawn" from Plants vs. Zombies
Liñ_B you should add the CoD zombies soundtrack
Liñ_B*
Lil*
cachi01|phone: actually, no. murder using a knife is outdated
Fuuuu
good Idea, but I'm more going towards the "Feeling" of Zombie Songs
Lil_B the COD zombies soundtrack is pretty good
115 feels like a zombie song
cachi01|phone yes XD I saw it the first time you wrote it XD, I'm gonna check it out
DO IT!
a Pony CD... would be cool too XD
Lil_B: I have a pony CD. I listen to it quite often. :D
Theres a site with all the brony music but i forgot its name
the Driver I drove to galaCon with had 2 CDs of bronie Songs XD
Ponies47: watcha doing? wanna play a round of TF?
cachi01|phone eqbeats?
Yeah i think
Eli: TF2? Regular or MvM?
Ponies47: regular?
Eli: Just with red and blu team.
Eli: No robots
I guess I could also look into the HL and Portal Soundtrack, some Songs may fit as well
silly Ponies47 such a mode doesn't exist anymore :P
Ponies47: i know what regular means :) that questionmark was added due to insecurity and to ask what you would like
Ponies47: never played MvM before...
Lil_B: Oh it still does
Ponies47: i just prefer PvP
Lil_B: HL2 has a pretty good soundtrack. As does Portal 2. Good ambient music. =)
Eli: We can do PvP. :3
Gold_Demona yes, and good Guy Valve released the fully Portal 2 OST as a Free Download :)
ok
Lil_B: Yes! I love it. ^^
Lil_B really? Awesome!
Gold_Demona I think my fav is Cara Mia
Lil_B: really? so i didn't have to download it illegally?
Eli yes XD
Lil_B: Yesh. That one's right up there for me. I can't really pick a favorite, though. I also love Robots FTW. That one's just fun. :3
also, the TF2 Soundtrack is also fully tagged as MP3 in teh TF2 Music Folder XD
Allegr0~
Eli: lol, I got it illegally too by ripping it right out of the game. Then the fre soundtrack came out. XD
Doom?
Ohai Allegr0
Ohi Allegr0
Hey all! Were live at BFF
Hi Allegr0! U also use androIRC? :)
Huzzah!

Ninjazz: Yeah, Walked into the local GameStop to pre-order my copy of Mist of Pandaria for Wow (Yes, I'm a player) and when I finished, the clerk says, "Oh, and here's your beta key so you can get a bit of practice in."
Okay logging off for now, check dat twitter!
Will do Allegr0.
Allegr0: get the hell out and continue having fun :I

That's awesome, Kencolt. =D

WhatWhatWhat: No :(
Has Wrek killed any BOBs yet?

Lucky
I'm just waiting on the Beta client to finish downloading-- which is taking a while.
cachi01|phone: there are theories and the connection with the logo
cachi01|phone: No, they're just made by the mane developer
cachi01|phone: but, I don't think anything is official
*Same
Obsidian i know. But the marines in halo look like the marines in marathon
I need to get back to writting my second chapter
heh. Did you watch the video relating the two?
lol
cachi01|phone: THough that might me more like a designers preference
Obsidian maybe
DerpyMuffins: I'm still working on mine. I'm taking a lunch break
6How you doing? :P

I'm not so lucky
6Fine,thx ^^ Though my finger is hurting for some reason.. o.o

twisted tale
anything new?
There was some controversy over the marines in Halo looking like Samus Aran. It got to the point where Retro Studios designed the story of Metroid Prime 2 around a bunch of similarly designed Galactic Federation Troopers who crashed their ship on an alien planet and then proceeded to die HORRIBLY before Samus arrived.
