Wouldn't CISPA affect other countries as well as the US if it passe?

You can thank Lamar Smith for starting it all.
It's called the American Dream because you'd have to be asleep to believe it.

he got a film, and is beloved by furries though
07but tablets hover around 1GHz
06Kyu that's
You are forgetting all the physics
