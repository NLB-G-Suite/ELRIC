Ninjazz: Its not that its OP, no gun is OP, cuz you can kill with any gun effectively, just that it is overused and takes no skill, the clip is really large as well

If it isnt actually the most epic mlp thing on the internet, you will be punished
Rodonies: Its considered rude :P

^
swallowing gum can make it get stuck in ur colon
lol wut
??
Nintendo is such a silly filly. :)
00,10realy who is going to answer one way then predict the poll going the other way?
Shane377: And watching TV gives you square eyes.
00,10dat hunt and peck typeing.
Answering the poll is expressing your own opinion. Answering the prediction is percieving how society would react.
inb4 unicorns win
u did realise chewin gum was designed not to break down
^
Oh, hello everypony.:)
ohai TheRainbowDash
lali-ho TheRainbowDash
TheRainbowDash, welcome.
Um, SuperBrony64, this isn't just going out to Bronies.
Shane377: Neither is most anything humans have ever made.
I think "pony" gives it away though.
so thus it just stays inside ur stomach
I ate a nail once.
I don't still have it in my stomach.
cant wait to see the result of that
00,10Yeah but every one is going to pick the same answer they chose Kandarihu. thuse the poll will stack
Wait, what is this? Question time on the Wii?
lol u pass it out
Kammerjunk um... wow
but since a chewy is sticky
SuperBrony64 make a poll : Are you a Brony?
it sticks k
Yep, TheRainbowDash.
11,02lol
Oh, ok..
...
SuperBrony64: are you using 2 screens linked together?
WiiFiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit
11,02Yes
SuperBrony64: Here is one....do you like toast? All people who say no are kicked from the chat.:D
11,02No :>
I prefer cereal.
What..
:3
Shane377: No. Your stomach can't break down a piece of gum the same way it breaks down normal food, but your digestive system can still move it along through normal intestinal activity.
11,02:<
/me glomps TheRainbowDash
hehehe
00,10^_^
11,02i liek toast ;~;
/me hugs Sumica
SuperBrony64 make a poll : are you a Brony
SuperBrony64: D'aww, you! Good that you like toast.:)
Or else..
/me hugs SuperBrony64
buttered toast is good
ooooh my feet
what about toasted butter?
RainbowCupcakeBath: it is good
00,10toasted butter goes well with lobster
Oke
Now if only bacteria could be treated the same as gum, I might do a bit less vomitting.
RainbowcrashNBurn: No, not toasted butter, silly! Toast with butter on it.:D
Kandarihu: If only.
maboshi?
toasted butter? how does one acheive that with out a pudle in the pan?
wait a minute, toasted butter is just melted butter
Yup
Oh yeah, pretty much..
Well, I don't vomit much from infections, as much as Gerd.
You put toast crumbs into a bowl of melted butter.
not sure... if you heat frozen butter hard and fast enough you muight achieve toasted butter
Or butter as... gas?
alrighty, I have to get some sleep now see ya guys later ^_^

Hey, do we have a new brony or a newcomer?
I think both

Sumi,put on the ME2 rap
If not both, probably a newcomer.
i went to the doctor and check me on me and stuff and confirm im sick with the fever
oow...this is a perfect place to be :D
as a brony
lol,you went to the doctor to see if you had a fever?
it is YamaTHou
Are you it, YamaTHou? Are you new to this place?

BBL
something bromine wouldn't fix but yeah problems
/me kicks down the closet door and steals the magazines
oow..so what is the purpose of the other rooms?
*bromide
/me gratefully leaves the weird and perveted Trixie alone
I was playing Cadences song "This day" from the finale, and I turned it deeper to see what it sounds like, and guess… what happened! (Hint: Something on my computer broke)
for during movie night Yama
monitor?
bacause one room with 3000 people is never good
Aw shit, Anomoly.
the speakers?
I'm gonna put on my cat ears now.
YamaTHou usually when there are new episodes playing, it gets crazy and spammy, so it's to filter it out a bit
Should have kept the base.
Mutterguy: Correct, My macbook speakers blew with a VERY loud left pop…
I can only use headphones now
ooow
:3
people here are really helpfull
Meoooow
/me cant wait for season 3
Phase4 we too
me too**
neither can the rest of the community
/me hopes Phase4 hopes John de Lancie is going to be voicing discord in season 3...
when will be aired?
Bronies are apparently really helpful and cool.
ctcb: search eqd
trust me
no one knows atm
they crashed ?,,...
no, we know. its on eqd
but there will be a season 3?
yes
but it might air somewhere in fall
Phase4: John De Lancie confirmed he is doing a Major voice for season 3… but he hasn't said which…
oh, WHAT he's doing
ctcb: double check eqd, i think he did
No one knows for certain.
He could be voicing a pony for all we know.
ooow
whos John De Lancie
allso, john de lancie might be a brony
I SENSE A CELESTIA EPISODE!
yeah
De Lancie is the guy who voiced Discord.
dishwasher_EXTREME he was an actor on star trek, also discord's va
how about a episode for backround ponies
he voiced Q
luna needs more episode
YamaTHou: WANT
/me wants that
Who's Luna ?
and a scootaloo episode
Fnar fnar.
Good morning everypony :)
morning DavidCortez
yeah
Sumi,you have Counter Striker 1.6?
i have
I wanna ask about scootaloo
where does she live?
Again, who the hell is Luna? Sounds like some lame OC.
YamaTHou: ponyvile
i sucks at fps
with who?
:P
by herself?
RawketLawnchair probably some mary sue
/me shrugs
Dken2021: Sounds about right.
With her parents of course.
But we honestly just don't know.
who is scootaloo parents
exactly
dishwasher_EXTREME: who knows
dishwasher
ZUES
do you want to play with meh?
quick question, if Cadence is Celestias niece, does that make her Luna's daughter?
No.
i deleted that game because i sucks at it
I dunno.
That's right. We need to see Scootaloo's family.
i can link you to a fanfic that has applejack and rainbow dash as scootaloo's parents, the explination is suprisingly rational
We don't know the blood lines.
who are scootaloo's parents? is it, the texas cowboys? the greenbay packers? the egyptians?
I think not
Phase4: wut.
Maybe she has more sisters
Dken2021: Scoots parents are hippies.
scoot scoot scoot-a-chicken
Ninjazz: wait until you read it
:/
Tactical Nuke Inbound.
mlp have many aliens character with no clear origin
I guess what was revealed of Cadance's past rules out her being related to Luna.
DAMN
and then everythign died
Awww.
you blew up the planet!
i think its more of a case that the nuke sucks
hahaha
you have to be outside of cover while charging it
Nukes always suck.
its a nuke, its gonna have a big range
Sumi,please play the Season 2 Finale
i working on one right now !!!
PWETTY PL0X
Nuclear bombs are only good for brandishing.
can I ask another thing
Go ahead.
so were gonna mass effect 2 all long?
Phase4: He said he was doing a voice for season 3, he didn't say it was discord. ( http://i.imgur.com/key72.png )
when that thing goes and they start flying XD it looks so goofy
ctcb: ah
Until Wrek gets on or so.
ctcb: theres allso a video of an interview
ya think Wrek will stream it?
Phase4: Where?
ctcb: somewhere on eqd
so when will be watching other things?
Ninjazz: http://www.fimfiction.net/story/836/Double-Rainbow
its full of wut
so when we will be watching other thins?
I am prepared for it, Phase4. :D
trust me
you're not
YamaTHou yea, but that depends if the streamer wants to do soemthing else
heck, the guy explains it to you and its still wut
good morning everypony
/me hugs everpony :3
/me hugs Tarku back
Phase4: How far back? Equestria Daily is a big place… :D
ctcb: just use the search, its fairly recent
I found a video where he DID admit that it's Discord, but he's very disconnected from the rest of the VAs. It's like he's giving speeches in the voice of Discord and he doesn't know how they're going to use his voice.
Phase4: Any ideas on the title?
Phase4: The author's profile picture scares me. o_o
wooo
Ninjazz: huh, used to be something different
Welp. I guess I'll give it read sometime. XAX wants me to read Party in Pink.
But I am honestly turned off my most AppleDash fics.
speaking of reading
by*
Phase4: This? http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=GWT-Yv0KXQI
anypony ever read my little dashie?
Most of us have.
I think everyone has, but not me
I've read it. :3 Meooooooow
ctcb: i found a different one, would look for it but i've got tech things to do
http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/04/27/google-zerg-rush-and-prepare-to-defend-your-browser/
:3
its really sad

02*WB03(Drake03)02WB* - <Lyon> 04I hate you all
after reading it,it makes me hate reality T_T
Hehehe.
ROB sure made himself a fic.
MLD was actually the thing that made me a brony.
wow
how?
What do you mean how?
More like 'why'
Oh.
Well...
I mean.you read it first before watching the actual show?
YamaTHou: Well, no. I was actually up to episode 13 before I actually read it.
oow
I wasn't actually a brony then...
I was just... How do you say this...
I didn't want to be associated with "bronies"
A fan?
Exactly, Sumi.
I justl ove that WOOOOOAH.
What's the chances of Discord returning?
I can give you my bio page on FIMfic explaining everything.
Its long...
Ehh. Fine.
hmm...is it that long?
I would love to read it while I'm not doing anything.
I mean veryyyyy long?
Meooooow
Yes. VERY LONG>
is worth to read?
And I'd hate to ruin like 2 hours of me writing down the damn thing.
Antigar? It's the one planet that can defeat the mecha from TTGL.
Well. I have had two people, XAX and the author of Heart of a Dragon, have called it a very good read.
I've been showing my mom FiM for a couple months now. And yesterday evening, she came home saying that someone that her favorite Talk Radio host was interviewing sounded very similar to Applejack. I believe she qualifies as a Brony now.
fine...I'll read it :)
May I read it?
link?
Very short summury. It is the story about how I first met MLP FiM and how I came to terms with being a brony.
Alright. Gimme a second.
And ofcourse you can, Spell-of-Cats.
Everything, Sumi.
Okay, I'm putting away my cat ears now.
http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Ninjazz - not as long as I remembered it to be.
for people in this room.how did you become a brony?
lol
Phase
this fic is giving me a headache
XD
Surprised me by just how much people actually called a good writer just for my BIO page.
oow
I noticed alot of pony related stuff on a forum I go on, so yea
But if you don't wanna read my bio page, what actually got me into the show was the actual show. But I first met MLP FiM as... Pony Porn. Hence me becoming a hater.
only a matter of time
hey guys just got back from dinner what did i miss
dat unloc
unlock'
eeew pony porn...
Yeah...
do you really jackoff to that?
DONT ASK ME!
Phase,this fic is giving me a headache
I know their cute but jacking off to them makes me sick
wtf i just eat dont make me puke ninjazz
/me sighs
http://techland.time.com/2012/04/27/cispa-house-vote-sets-up-senate-cybersecurity-showdown/
lol
sorry
Im srry, man. But its part of my history.
that is some history....pony porn and shit
XD
peace :)
wait what
the vi....
Ahh.
Yeah.
escilate defences,needs more power
so you give it power?
you know what, i may be back but i dont think i want any idea as to what led to that conversation
Holy crap... That was soooo good.
Well, it makes a WHOLE lot freakin sense when i wrote it down. I actually took my time to remember how I took things.
still sounds like a bad idea
Holy crap, Spell-of-Gaming. Did you like it that much>
Sumica: it looks like your trying to restore this facility, would you like some help? :P
lol puzle
Yeah, it was really good, Ninjazz.
hahahaha
then I heard fluttershy yay :D
Well... Thank you, Spell-of-Gaming.
if it works it works
It warms my heart that people actually take time to read that. My bio page of all things.
Yeah, it was really good, Ninjazz.
I'll read it later Ninjazz
Lol accidental
Do as you please, YamaTHou. :)
evil shep looks awesome :P
Accidental up arrow button
No one is forcing you.
Thank you, Spell-of-Gaming. Really.
I really want to read it
That was a really big cycle
but its been a blast being here
cant have that 26%
04At least "sharing" information is better than SOPA
so just realized how old granny smith is, know how she said she practically founded ponyville, and how twilight said winter wrap up has been a ponyville tradition for hundreds of years?
O_O
Good lord...
In my headcanon, the ponies have 2 birthdays.
/me shrugs
Well. er. No.
I never thought about it like that...
an eccentric old lady being senile? what are the chances of that! :P
^
You know, maybe they have short years on the planet that Equestria exists on.
back again what r we talking about ?6_9
and yeah...we don't know what is live span of a pony is
1 for the actual birthday, and the other is for the day when they got their cutie mark
is the*
i wonder how people would react if they put humans into season 3
@_@
All we do know about age is that Celestia and Luna have lived forever.
perhaps mixed results RainbowcrashNBurn
DONT PUT HUMANS IN
no please
But, Iron Will is practically a human!
I wouldn't mind them. Would be weird as hell though.
who knows, we may get the return of the sea ponies in the human episode :P
NOT THE SEAPONIES
Aren't minotaurs half human?
Tia's a dumb nkckname.
Well, I assume that because Celestia and Luna have lived for 1,000 years AT LEAST.
Why not go an extra thousand or so? :D
so what do u want to call her ? celest?
she is a alicorn right?
Now, CENATAURS, that's probably weird
tia must have parents right ?
I read in a good fic that her name was Celly. Is that one better?
Right,
Good point.
better than tia
if tia is thousand of years old then her parent would be ....OH MY THE FACT IS UNREAL !!:O
Alicorns arent even mentioned in show, its a fan given thing right?
Yeah ^
yeah
Well, the name is
Winged Unicorns
Pegacorns...
I think Alicorn is much more better
In myths, they're more known as winged unicorns
its more catchy :D
Very catchy.
Have some Lyra: http://i.imgur.com/vPVEP.png
how old is tia parents ?
Reanar lol XD
Renard: :D
Renard*
"Celly" and "Lulu", as far as we know, have no parents.
They just came to be.
poof...just like that?
yes but WHAT IF...HOW OLD WOULD THEY BE
was cadence named before or after "this day aria" was written? mainly because of the techniques used in the song
Well as far as things can go. Yes, poof.
QUARTER of the things the fandom made are my headcanon
i think nobody knows
Sumica: seems legit
hahaha
TBH the MLP crew just make up things as they go and TRY not to contridict themselves too much.
they would probably be 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000....... years old
Don't do that.
yeah man...dont flood
by the way....
Actually, they're probably more like 5,000 years
so what do you do (pony related)on your spare on the computer if there are no more pony episodes?
i watch avatar
Hmmm.
My theory is that since pony genetics allows two Earth Ponies to give birth to Unicorns and Pegasi, it would be possible, albeit EXTREMELY rare for a Winged Unicorn to be born. And any that ARE born have the legal standing of a male Gerudo.
I play game. Re watch MLP episodes. I need to get to Avatar - Legend of Korra.
aquabats is 2nd best show evar :3
desktop ponies an watch fanart
Jeez, MLP HAS TAKEN OVER MY LIFE!
And I am glad for it...
Ninjazz brohoof.
:D
dat can
It's a shocker everytime I think about it, Sumi.
Actually, they're probably more like 5,000 years
YamaTHou: /)
I think I have too many pony wallpapers
I don't have enough.
i have none hooray
Wow...
I have something for you to do on your spare time...maybe you already doing it,but what I do is I go equestriadaily go to the comic section.and read some awesome pony comics

I have another random question...I you dont mind to tell how old are you?and are you male or female?
that ship w/ the spinning rings in it reminds me of the Bentusi from Homeworld
If you dont*
Ninjazz: and remember, i study in a university of arts and design here, so maybe i could find a potential creative brony here :)
I keep trying to get my few friends into MLP. But so far, my closest friend thinks its just weird. Even thought I keep proving how awesome it is.
SpringStingray: i have to finish a report on research i did on 3D technology and its future
im 15 male
valoreins: :O More pony art!
im 14 male
15 male
17 guy
were all the same person

Almost a week away from being 18 actually.

Right now as in right now,
All that fru-fru cuddliness and laces
how about you Sumica?
in the world today gray is the best colour
Maybe because MLP is better than MOST television right now.

I hope that's not the case
No scratch that. IT IS BETTER.
let's turn off our TV and watch ponies in your laptop!
YEAH
that's how today's world should be right now
Supposeing Friendship is Magic ends up jumping the shark in S3. The whole Brony movement will fall apart.
no...but its good to know :)...I was asking how old are you?
FIM WILL NEVER DIE
i want a movie
NO
they definately can do it
Its such a sad possibility.
But its true.
what's the meaning of "jumping the shark?" (sorry not native speaker)
every MLP movie has ended the generation
dentidiot I like your thinking
hmm
its means it could end,val
oh

Obama promised to veto it, but you can't trust him with that.
it will will just be in a while...
so just dont worry about it.

cispa means the government has the right to request your internet data from just anyone who has them. facebook, ebay, everyone

Equestria is a Feudal matriarchy where in order for the couple to get married they have to get approval from the local Baroness (Probably Granny smith)

Suited for success, i believe
Meanwhile of course, Luna is best pony
/me checks
Jim: i might no atleast one person, but none definitly, but last time i went to the group 50 miles away i didnt know anyone atall
00,10ah oki
Meanwhile: I could only imagine...
Everytime Luna appeared in the pub we missed her lines because everyone went "AAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
So you'd think it's worth it traveling 50 miles, right?
lol
Followed by "Sssshhh"
00,10any who, gonna ptfo here so enjoy the eps

Chrysalis has the same VA as Trixie, but I don't think Cadence does.
Everypony but Twilight was an ixdiot in this episode. And SPOILERS, they don't say sorry for being wrong.
healing eh?
You Liar! Colgate would never do that :|
wedding makes ppl idiots...
At this one moment in the two episodes, I seriously, genuinely hated Shining Armor.
owned
REJECTED!
dentidiot of course, can't have black mages without white mages
good thing twi is an egghead..
Oi. Twilight just knows Cadence differently.
You failed, twilight!
Yeah, they NEVER aplogize for being wrong.
To the MOOOOOOOOOON!
trolestia
Only she knew who Cadence was back then.
to the mooon!
fuq you celestia

Shut up.
I think we should assume they apologise later.
AWW
D:
Celestia spoke= SHIT GETS REAL
well this is sad
they did apoligize right?
that's what you get for ruining his wedding
cruash
And even Celestia, who made Twilight her protege and who never questioned her before, was a jerk.
lol
Rageface.
WELCOME TO YOUR DOOM!
Everyone was decieved. At this point, even Twilight Sparkle was convinced that that Cadance was genuine. If Chrysalis hadn't acted, her facade would've remained intact.

I can't tell you how loud the "FUUUUUUUUUUUU"s were in the pub every time there was a break.
She never even questioned that Twilight might not be on an ether trip, but had a reason to say what she did.
yay!
but twilight is very strong
08,01Meanwhile: i wish i was there
hmm
indeed
is it bad that I went to a Achievement server on TF2?
Yes
epic intro
Very yes
You know what's funny? ofna01 wanted to see this so bad. He is no longer here.
still doesn't explain how celestia doesn't even notice something is off
Anyone know which server Luna is making that Bronystate guild on for Guild Wars 2, or if anyone could get in touch with her for me? :3
Commander_Shepard: so you were weak when you were indoctrinated?
it would be fun to live there
....I do what I want.
yes
Oh Hai. OooH! Ryal Weddin'?
I am not banned yet, and there are MANY others that use them before me.

I wonder how the cadance toy sales are going?

I love how twilight will just forgive and forget the bs she got before
and there it went
but i doubt we will have more viewers.. considering no more new pony ep..
I don't even use this chat during movie night. Too hectic.

Oh, wait dont you live somewhere around Sweden?

WASN'T A KISS.

6 on 2000000 so unfair
1,3was

Real me!
They were 300
kirzstryfe, Was, totally was
Play it frame by frame, it wasan't.
Wasn't a kiss, was just a sweeping sound of Dashie picking her up!
Against a million
Dat Pinkie.
Twilight is now cannon.
Twilight is now Cannon
keep expecting these changlings to have that little inner mouth that the xenomorph's have
Also, Hai kirzstryfe! I have to go, but good morning!
"Do me" inb4 comics.

FlareChaser: NINJAD
this fight reminds me of rayman origins xD
correction: Twilight is now Gatling
1,3:)
lol fluttershy
Notice how Fluttershy used her ADORABLENESS to kill the changeling.
Ninjazz: ...mean
Party Cannon doubling as a real cannon!
08,01dat Matrix music quote
fluttershy weaponised cuteness, thats a dangerous weapon
it's always a party with Pinkie
beats staring at them Litwick
FlareChaser: It's in my blood. ;)
does confetti really damages that much? :o
without bronies, this episode would never have happened
Sorry im back i died from fluttershy
Flare Chaser would fight them....WITH AWESOMENESS.
Snuffsis: Dude, what if- just hear me out. WHAT IF Twilight could shoot party cannons like that?
and then hentai
Dat goop.
oh noes
lol spike
08,01Pinkies4th|mopping: i had a dream about Chrysallis

Celest in a chrysalis, wonder what she would turn into
Kammerjunk: Whoa... Far out, man.
Reapers are harvesting
lol
twilight gun is best gun
derpy_pony it probably would've still been made, it was backed by faust
Collectors.
Celestia is...doing something...in that Caccoon.
applejack apologises!
Chrysalis is best villain art-wise
i had a dream about Vinyl Scratch fighting with beam saber and a Powerfull Bass Cannon
Another song time!

Mass Effect
gosh the same thing happened in episode 1
best chaos
Kammerjunk I'm confused, wat?
I love the laugh at the end
Doctor Whooves is screwed.
Dr Whooves X Carrot Top is now canon.

08,01derpy_pony: no, cute

Oh come on, like you expected anything different.
Wrek|Observing: Probably, Like Lunas armor, it's always there.
Got there first Meanwhile. :P
Love > all. You should know that by now.
Doctor

08,01Shining Armor cannot get it up.
or maybe Chryssalis's wings are strap ons
lol
08,01he needs love to get it up.
I have to say that is a better male pony
08,01THE SHIELD. GET UP THE SHIELD.

08,01god, you people and your dirty minds.
Mass Effect yay

BRACE YOURSELVES, the Clopfics are coming.

NUE RUB YOUR FACES TOGETHER!
'are coming' implies that they aren't already here.
Drat! I've been beaten by the power of loooooooovvvvveeeeee!
Brace yourself, you 'bout to get owned.
FlareChaser they were out a few hours after the show aired

Cadance will live 900 years longer than Shining Armor.
You are now breathing Manually

Needs to, probably won't.
these eps could have easily been a movie
I need those birds
Ehhhh. Not sure how you would make a good movie out of it...
I mean how many previous generation MLP movies were there?
Suddenly over-popular franchises easily lead to movies.
I wouldn't be surprised
08,01CrimsonPhoenix: i tell you, if they do a movie, it'll gross soooo much
Snuffsis: You are now aware that your jaw has weight and you have to hold it up
1,3*cough*battleship*cough*
The scenes where everpony turns on Twilight.
^
lol
this is all a guess, but s3 is 13 episodes. wonder if there making a movie with the time for the other 13 eps

Cadence married Shining Armor to get closer to Twilight, you cannot unsee.
:O

05kinky jewelry, check.
you!
TheRandomkid321 What you talking about? DBZ Evolution was a masterpiece.
Ninjazz, saying about not sure about how they'll make a movie. Easy to do if they make the villain actually hard to beat
lol wrek
Sundaysmile: Yeah, she was a tank in our group.
Snuffsis Your kidding. your kidding right?
Sundaysmile: I know that feel. And it still isn't dead. T^T

No Luna, nothing at all.
I agree with Wrek|Observing
Nooooo Luna you surely haven't
lunaaa
08,01this episode makes me hate being single
ALLRIGHT!
Guys, wasn't Vinyl in the dark in this episode? That means her eyes still haven't been trechnically confirmed. All we know is it's a possible shade of red. Just throwing it out there.
Dat Vinyl!
WOO
EYES
she sounds different to her ep
ohai luna
no she doesnt
Litwick: they're magenta, deal w/ it
/me dances
celectia
does it make you hate being single or hate not having hooves?
UnFoundBug: I think she sounds the same as in Luna Eclipsed.
I wonder just how many freaked out when they saw Vinyl... Then saw her eyes.
applejack can play the violin?
fancy pants!
FlareChaser: chosw you at random but did this message pinpoint to you and did it make a sound? (im new)
1,3MLP movie summary: peaceful times, enemy appears, enemy monologue, mane6 defeated, quest, evil monologue, epic battle, enemy defeated, peace
I don't have a problem with her magenta eyes. They IMO loom better than the fanon red eyes
KaitoThePony:
08,01derpy_pony: all hillbillies can
Ninjazz probably similar to when derpy showed up
Decent summary kirz. :P
08,01that and the banjo

Way too long.
lol
Wait, what?

Why is everything black?
Black screen?

Man, I played the shit out of WC3. I was never good, but man the custom maps for it were AMAZING!
Everything is black, except for text. :D
Black screen for...some reason.
08,01Cobellanez: this is the Bronx version
why everything is black?
Ahh
These games haven't aged very well, graphically.
Bye Everypony!
:P
the bronx has their own version?
Later valoreins
bai valoreins
because it's night time Commander_Shepard
That's one fine green square.
Cya valoreins
Well, its time to play TF2.

Lasharus: Nothing ever ages well graphically.

the screencap program can't read dosgames
Tbh, think I'm gonna go give WC3 a whirl now. I'll see you folks later for movie night :3
I'll see you al later.
hello everypony!
Kammerjunk WC3 has aged pretty well though. :P
the graphics in this game are amazing!
Yes, but some games can rely on out-dated graphics but still remain visually pleasing.
Cya Meanwhile. Take care.
This one seems to have some trouble with it :P
You people and your playing of good games before 7PM central
Im going to bed if I wish to eake up before movie night (mornign where I live)

Cya TheRandomkid321

Wrek|Observing, don't wanna be that "pony" but the screen is completely black.
1,3pretty pictures are nice, but without decent gameplay they're not worth much
sound so silly
Snuffsis: But not compared to new games.
RIGHTO
I don't get this game
Wrek|Observing: we can't see much in the stream. all the gfx are black
hi
Exactly kirzstryfe
OH KAY
1,3~work compleet~
Wrek's just playing blind because he's being pro
1,3:3
Wut ease it?
Kammerjunk Well, sure it's not as pretty as newer games, but it's still quite pretty nonetheless. :P
Atleast in my opinion
who is streaming
Wrek
I don't know about you guys, but I'm enjoying these green squares.
/me can't wait for the GW2 beta in 4 hours
I'm enjoying the voices. :D
iindeed
bigger the square, the stronger it is
1,3me too Jim :)
Wrek is almost Wrex
The_Si: lol
Does anypony know this site? http://www.ponybin.net/
Well, WC2 was released in 1995. I could probably have told you that it wouldn't give a donkey's flank about your streaming tools.
Jim, you know which server for the Bronystate guild?!
YES YES YES MY LORD
YES! YES! YES!
Not sure
Am I the only one seeing the stream almost black?
08,01
08,01UUEERRRGGH

http://www.sadanduseless.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/8.jpg
UUUUUGHHHH
Get those red squares!

OH MY GOD HNNNNG

YES MI'LORD.
lol Kammerjunk
Is the stream completely black?
yes
Yesh
roighto
It makes so sense because we can't see the details
and wrek cannot see chat
Simon2 Not completely black! :D
not sure if wrek has noticed that it doesn't stream properly
no, there is some green and white in stream
We also have boxes
I bet Wrek is really just trolling us.
yeah, we're streaming a black panther rally
Just watch the minimap
1,3I say we go with Eternal Grove for the GW2 world
it's full screen
kirzstryfe Sounds good, i'll get on there then. :D
wrek is too mature to troll anyone
when the red bits appear, all hell breaks loose
Like yesterday?
dat chopping
derpy_pony: He does it in his own very special way.

After this can we watch the MLP mov. like apple mov. :'(
KaitoThePony: I don't think the streamers here like to stream those .movs
Why would i keep those?

RankWinner, welcome.
Jim: im realy new to this and yesterday i heard many people ask for it
Did I miss anything? And CrimsonPhoenix, where did you find that xD
KaitoThePony: Did you notice it not getting streamed?
Yeah, people ask for them, but most mods don't stream those
I have my source
Huzzah, fixed
Hi guys!
nice Jaketehsnake ^^
Your source is awesome
hai lolol
Hi lolol
Wrek|Observing: sorry for leaving that SC2 game yesterday, my internet died
Ninjazz: They showed somthing else mature.. it was metal somthing
1,3Jaketehsnake, what was the name of the map we played last night?
Aw man pirating warcraft 2
05actually no
KaitoThePony: We usually show anything other than ANY.mov and anything related to Cupcakes.
05jsut gettign a NoCD installed
o cool
i wouldnt judge myou if you did pirate it, its a good dame
Also hard to get legally these days.
Tends to happen with 17 year old games.
Ninjazz: I find it weird how when other people do stuff i do they get off the hook but when i type stuff like this i get "dont do that"
Ninjazz: we do show the .movs, just not the shed.mov
KaitoThePony: Shit happens, man. Nothing we can do.
lolol: Did not know that.
Actually its up to the streamer.
shed.mov isnt even that bad
Ninjazz: is it just to the new bronies?
magic.mov is the best .mov, HANDS DOWN
KaitoThePony: Not really.
KaitoThePony: Its just that it's not allowd in here.
Ninjazz: i mean do people talk like that to the new bronies
KaitoThePony: Like what?
KaitoThePony: And are you a new brony?
what isn't allowed?
Magic.
*snort snort*
mov is the best
nah.
Good morning Bronies and whatever we call female fans
the .mov stuff?
hai mitamaking
mitamaking, welcome.
Bronys
dat piratebay
hi mitamaking
we call them bronies
lolol: actually, pegasisters
INB4 THE FBI CLOSES DOWN BRONYSTATE D:
Ninjazz: like yesterday a person asked for ponies and they gave us bad old ponies then i said "you should of said FIM!" then they said "don't do that" i was thinking thats what you ment!
i like pegasisters but they dont ;(
Simon2: nope, that failed
lolol: how so?
I thought they were working on something with filly in the name
hey guys did you know? http://i.dhne.ws/1327256602.jpg
brony comes from /b/ro which is obligatory to gender, so brony is also obligatory
lol wc2 fail
still
Wrek|Observing: it doesnt stream W2 properly
hai hai
omg chat ception again
She was ChiChi too!!!!
i think it just wont work
05like i dont know
KaitoThePony: Ahhh. You must be new here. If you DEMAND ponies, you will be given ponies. Just not the kind you probably want. Just behave yourself, don't be rude, and just generally try to respect the authority of the mods.
SOrry....
Wrek you would need to put wc2 in windows
Seems Reboot shares a few voices with Fim, remember the Spike sighting in that one episode
Demanding ponies leads to G3.5, don't demand ponies
Ninjazz: i mean they siad "my little pony episode" and it just gets me mad when i do the same thing and a "user" not a mod tells me not to do that
hai hai
>->
KaitoThePony: You have a name. Its easier to pick up on name instead of "pony_2839734021754098127".
KaitoThePony: would you prefer a mod to tell you off?
Just take it as a way of being noticed.
wy demand even demand ponies?
KaitoThePony: or a user to friendly warn you
so, we just going to yell at the new guy?
my name now
What new guy?
-_-
05hey atleast there's good music
newish guy
agreed
Ninjazz: nah they just say "dont do that" and im like wut did i do
I'm fairly certain I've seen KaitoThePony before.
/me dances to Wrek's music
bah, humbug
/me dances with Ninjazz
I havent seen him, so hes new
No stream or am I just not loading it
Kammerjunk: yea you have yesterday night was my first day as a bronie
Well, learn what you did wrong, KaitoThePony. Take the opportunity to learn from your mistakes.
Not sure if serious
There it is
ikr Jim
a newer brony than me ...
KaitoThePony: Right-o, then!
Ninjazz: i don't think i did anything wrong i think the mod that was up liked to troll... (he kept showing justin beiber)
Discussion time! Cheese and onion crisps vs salt and vinigar vs ready salted
GO
hooza for for everyone that still is becoming one
ive seen you around foxinator, or atleast i though ti had
That name just isn't going to stick
KaitoThePony: I... What?
vinegar all the way
like since saterday
hmm
was my first time here
....no way
i guess so
Ninjazz: /
KaitoThePony: dont... please...
baby baby oh baby
your name just seems familiar
KaitoThePony: Alright. I can probably explain that.
Ninjazz: o30
KaitoThePony: Remember what I said about DEMANDING?
http://i.imgur.com/NvqQs.png :'3
Ninjazz: Some mods are weird
sea ponys any one
GUYS
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/26/Cybersix.jpg This...is SPIKE
1,3No I isn't >.>
dude, all the mods ar eweird
*are weird
dat chicken PrincessDismo
lol
I will nevr figure this out xD
05screw this
good
i dont think anyone in the world is weird#
dont figure it out
Jim: Me and SuperBrony64|Zzz Have been trying to get that shot of her without the HUB logo ;~;
Where did the Scottalo is a chicken thing start? Pinkie was the chicken
he is screwing it O.o
KaitoThePony: If you DEMAND. You won't be given anything good or anything you will like. That is why you REQUEST. As silly as that sounds, just do it. It is basic common courtesy and respect.
/me glomps Ninjazz
Sup bronystate
hey ZombieBrony
oh neat
/me is glomped ^^
ohai ZombieBrony
/me waves at ZombieBrony from a safe distance
Ninjazz: i never demanded yesterday i just watched and learned and when i copied some things they did i get crap
O_O So much torrents
Hi everyone
we should watch Cybersix in here sometimes
Thepiratebay?
KaitoThePony: a long time ago, when i was a silly filly, i said"I demand poni" as a joke, then the mods played an episode of G3, tru story
/me contains ZombieBrony for study
KaitoThePony: Don't follow a stupid crowd.
05atleast with the torrent it runs without a CD
ZombieBrony: eeyup
05which will make the winforcer work
G3 is worst pony
05untill then
tell that to g3.6
G3,5 is worst pony
G3.5 is worst pony
1,3you have to remember, nobody is getting paid to be here, all the staff and streamers do this when and because we want to, and we're still human so there are times when we may miss something
Ninjazz: i don't think i demanded anything i think they started talking a bout ponies and i sais "that sounds cool"
Jim: i agree
Last night was fun, wasn't it.
G3.5 is not even a pony
Wait, no one in here actually remembers it
What's happening today?
Ninjazz: then i got "you don't want to do that"
except for possibly Phase4
you guys are human?
kirzstryfe: what are the procedures of becoming a mod?
treamer gets paid.. a-it all goes to the server but still
we dont like to talk about G3.5...
i thought yu were an alien race of superbeings
Movie night and looks like a Guild War 2 beta Anotherguy
kirzstryfe: so basically you are hear cause you want to be here
Simon2 long, ardious and not open for a long while
DOOM?
dat grammar cow334
anyone else heard Aviators - In Wonder?
lets see.... what was last night again
Doom to Pony music?
pavarkian: lol im sorry
/me is super excited for the beta
tis k
KaitoThePony: Listen... Don't dwell on this. Just move on. Just forget about it. The mods deal with alot of crap and they don't really have all the time in the world to single out every single innocent person. Just behave. Respect others. You'll do fine here.
%kirzstryfe: and i luv u here too :) but i will get confused once in a while
1,3we say we're looking for mod, people send in apps, and we go from there, or you can send an email to bronystate@gmail.com saying you're interested in applying to become a mod (when we're not actively recruiting) and you may get a response
I have lots of screencaps.
But I'll give you a clue first.
Last night was this: @pokemon
oh yeah
1,3well, I'm here because they chained me to the wall again, but that's another story
@pokemon
12 ScootaChicken is a/an 2 Chingling
05my computer hasnt been on my side today
ooh, doom
Ninjazz: k :)
;)
id be a mod, but... meh
The Dark Side
If I had stuff to show(and knew how to do it) I would apply, but people on here hate anime
I dunno why
1,3I love the Aviators' music
kirzstryfe: Is the person who wanted to be a mod required to be active in chat?
same
08,01i'm a mod because i chained kirzstryfe to a wall
doom!! wooot
08,01but that's another story
:( I don't hate anime
this is a really neat looking mod
... Holy shit the visuals O_O
this is not the original shotgun
dat history...
I like anime
I could stream... I have enough stuff
Just seems most people would rather not watch anime here
08,01Jim: thank you; i try
O U :3
well then they don't have to watch
:P
I could get some bloody disney movies...
1,3Simon2, it can help in the app process, just so people know you
Why are always chained to walls, kirzstryfe?
They don't show movies outside of movie night I think
I know
man doom was a bucking hard game
I just was imagining
1,3can't tell you, tv-14 rating and all that >.>
god i love walls
:D
LOL
Doom guy vs master cheif was awsome
master cheif FtW
uh oh
incase you havent see it i wont say who won
If I was a dentist, I'd say "May the Floss be with you" to every patient
o-o-o-o-o-o-o--uh huh uhuhuhuhuh
do they respawn?
Jim: You'll get many regulars.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_MFauHzdo
Just be careful of the idlers, they are not always what they seem
i'd come over there to gt my theaat done :p
How do you have over 100% health?

KaitoThePony: Stop. Stop. Stop.

Let me fix that
Alright. Here, KaitoThePony, if you want to be a good pony amongst the fine bronies of BronyState you will need a little education. Here is a link to the FAQ, http://www.bronystate.net/faq/, and here is the Rules, http://www.bronystate.net/rules/. Just take a small run through both.
brb
KaitoThePony: You are running out of pity from the mods, they get angry, you know what they say about Bruce Banner, the mods are worst

yes
I know Pinkies4thWall, I'm gonna be doing it for a while it seems
how would you be able to rp in here?
where are these channels you speak of
I dont want to i was just saying
i'm confused
1,3and when you have over 100 people in chat and 3 feel like RP'ing, it's not fair to the other 97 to make them watch
Hey, gotta let the new ones learn.
pavarkian you can use /list to see all available channels

/me cringes

Mattcrowley2a right
It's time to eat! BRB
Just as I thought...
WoW sucks , no offence
^
foxinator: Ahahahaha....
its just so exensive
So glad my father stopped playing such.
*sings the song of icecream*
exensive?
my ice cream is melting
expensive * sry
That doesn't mean it must suck though
Check this out! http://translate.google.com/#auto|en|Mi%20Amore%20Cadenza
foxinator: it didn't at first. but somehow, it got worse with every addon and patch. at cataclysm i said to myself "lol, fuck this shit" and never looked at it again
But I agree that it's kinda expensive for my tastes
honestly i dont like the gameplay as well
Jim mothly costs are a reason
It's 30 bucks for 2 months, that sounds like a good deal for me.
in the rules do you get kicked for being a mexican?
sure
/me sings the CAMPFIRE SONG song for no reason at all..anyone wanna sing with me?
What the hell?
I hope not. That is just racist!
/me facehoofs forever
man seeing this makes me miss Total Annihilation
foxinator: well,t hat's opinion then
KaitoThePony: Just dont speak mexican.
its way to focused on grinding
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOME ONE MESSES WITH COW http://icanhascheezburger.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/funny-animal-gifs-animal-gifs-bring-it-yo1.gif

05TEH_MASTRE_CHEIF: get a proper name, learn hwo to properly type, or get out.

Ahahahahaha...

I just watched something...awesome.
I like this server.
kirzstryfe: im pretty suer no one would ever send a text message like that

guatamole

06!umbreonglow

Another cool thing is active quests while you attack. Less "get quest, do it"
we both can't type it right
06:<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
Yea, MMOs are the best when played with friends. <3
06:P
Oh and bosses will scale depending on the number of players in the area
kirzstryfe: and thats how MMOs work.
I'm willing to give em a try, but then I get strangly bored.
That.. is one.. big-ass dragon O.o And hi everypony =O
FlareChaser: Actually she's just really lazy on friday.
i have the first one but did not play it much
Again, you are correct kirzstryfe

3hey there :)
3What's going on?
Allo SlurryMoon.
mmo's are fun when you play for fun, even if your team sucks
kirzstryfe: so what is going to happend or like what is coming up with the game gw2 is there going to be like a big match for brony please tell me
moin SlurryMoon

Invi I will do that, i just don't know what server we're going for. T_T
bronys
o-O
1,3no trinity, you scale to the dungeons(no power levelling through dungeons), dodging means you actually have to dodge, skills matter more than having a screen full of buttons
Damn.. made me wanna play Gw 2 T.T
brb
I'm going to play it in 2 hours, closed beta. <3
Hey SlurryMoon
hello SlurryMoon
=O Hai moon
I'll see whether GW2 is playing when WoW ends.
Snuffsis we don't really know either xD http://royalnightguards.enjin.com/forum
1,3and best of all
Until then I remain invested in Azeroth.
kirzstryfe: is the game going to be online or something with bronys
1,3you can JUMP!
There is some form of "hit me" / "I'll help you" / "I can restore health"
1,3:3
02!Cmds
02*WB03(Rukario03)02WB* - <Umbreon> there really isn't anything hard about DOS <Umbreon> except making it do something useful
But it isn't ... that important
Invi Is that the official one for Bronystate guild? :O
Inb4 Jumping becomes OP and is removed
brb
Ah yeah you can't jump in GW1 can you.
Snuffsis no, apparently not :(
That was always really annoying for some reason.
/me still belongs to Xanbreon for 12 more minutes
02:<
D:
homework time
Snuffsis but it already has 24 members ^^
1,3because there were zones where you'd get stuck on the terrain, early on at least
hey guys
kirzstryfe It's not actually FULL dodging, there are some abilities that are seeking and some that is dodgable by just moving out of the way. :P
I cant wait to try out a mage. Switching between fire and ice on the fly would be cool
hey dentidot hows your day been
whats streaming?
b0rk
x3
err.. elementalist? whatever that is
i blame Xanbreon
good thx
Rogue > everything.
dentidiot: nothing ^^
1,3I'll be playing Ranger most likely, that was my class from GW1
ok den
Ele/Necro was awesome in GW1 :D
Yeah. I loved Ranger in GW1
Ill is there gonna be another one setup for the 2nd beta?
I blame me
!umbreon
!Umbreon
/me claims all the eons >:/
The 8 ability setup kind of bugged me in GW1
I played Ele/Necro when it was op, impossible to kill because of insane HP regen and dmg. :P
Noes attack of the AE
engineer for me :3
13:D
1,3I liked it, made choosing your abilities part of the strategy
I remember when it was 12 ability setup in the beta
i just beat mighty switch force woo!
Imokwiththis.png
yea
/me traps AE between all the eons.
i don't think i have the umbreon script on this computer
AE eonwich
I liked it as well
so sorry SXD
i has potentialy solved 503 problems
kirzstryfe: I think I might get GW2, I'm not sure, I'm still waiting for Pandas on WoW.
Damn.. that dramatic music <.<

Pandas are awesome!
WoW.. Its a great game.. but they have to uppgrade the graphics or something soon xD
My bro is still working with Eve Online in releasing that lego project. Then we will probably spend a month or two on Old Republic. Then I'll switch to GW2. I don't like to be part of that initial wave of people
Gnight Phase4 gone

Hi everypony
flutter_spin You and your brother hyped for DUST514 then? I sure am. <3
hi
cow334: What?
1,3it's a game that is coming out later this year cow334
FlareChaster: O? They are?
hey Saigneur hows your day been
I played GW2 beta, I found GW1 better, but hey its just a Beta.
fine thanks alexxm ^^ u ?
1,3it's an mmo on the pc, no monthly fee
13And suddenly, everything in the world makes perfect sense
:O
:D rofl found this comic on Equestria Daily if anyone hasnt seen it already,:D lol Shining Armor http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1Uzj-i433Vc/T5jSqNlnFrI/AAAAAAAAneU/vhd9uS6qEEw/s1600/the_magic_of_love_by_csimadmax-d4xo0n7.png
lol
good Saigneur
1,3and there's a closed beta this weekend if you pre-purchased it
Invi, are you going on for the GW2 beta in <2 hours?
cow334 it's just a online game hype ^^
kirzstryfe it is funded by microtransactions though
kirzstryfe: oh okay thank you any thing special do like an online commuinty or nothing
or so iv heard
Wait, whoa whoa whoa... No Monthly Fee?
let me plot
how do?
No Monthly Fee?
Invi: how many players online are you going to get it
Snuffsis no :( bu I'yy buy it if it releases here
Yea, but it's only items that make you look pretty, nothing that will make you better. :P
lol Sketch_Toku_Pony
Yeah, same as the first one
... no monthly fee. That is what makes in awesome
i can hold off on DOS homework, i think we are going over it in class anyway
cow334 too many xD
I am suddenly interested.
Invi Aww shucks.
1,3the good thing about the micro transactions is they've said it will not affect the core gameplay to give you an advantage over others
i know right!? :D
No monthly fee, that is what makes you all look like the homeless.
written communication i need to wait till i get feedback from the writing center
Snuffsis ik :(
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Omg xDD That is priceless
WoW is 30 bucks for 2 months. People: ITSSOEXPENSIVEHUURRRG
ah so its all cosmetic? very nice
help desk it is
Invi: how much would you say like how many players online can be in one match
Dat Derp.
lol Sketch_Toku_Brony
Meanwhile: When you only make 12k a year, come back and tell me that
i actually tend to spend more on cosmetic-only microtransactions
13Lol homework, procrastination FTW
cow334 about 1000?
lol i know! :D
flutter_spin: I personally don't even make that.
thats how much i make a yr
which countru will we take over first
Invi: HOLY SH-- that is a lot are you going to get theb game
back
guys, i need your help, i want the last song of ArchieV : love is in bloom, but his youtube account is closed, anypony have download it ???
cow334 the MM in MMO stands for Massively Multyplayer ^^
wdup bonies
i kinda hate free to play games because if you dont pay for items it gets boring and repetitive
I feel awkward talking about this.
Invi: oh okay thank you
why is the game paused
cow334 the o stands for online xD
Saigneur i have ti downloaded, want me to send it to you over irc?
Too much white text.
about what FlareChaser
Invi: oh okay
The full stop stands for a full stop
Wrek went out to grab some food.
That is if you got a standalone irc client. :P
i'm trying to prioritize by when my next class comes so XD
Its just bonus points. It is like a car salesman saying that the car has higher gas mileage. It barely makes a dent, but hey everything counts

1,3we'll have a bronystate guild, yes
I played SWTOR but in no way did I believe it would kill WoW
hey digi
five hours :0
helllo Digit|ArtMode
WoW doesn't die. It's like Cthulhu.
swtor is hurting big time, not from the game perspective, but because how the company is working with it.
uderp
bronystate guild where?
kirzstryfe: Bronystate guid, where GW2?
1,3and SWTOR was never going to kkill WoW, it's far too similar
Hi ^^
dont say wow
plz dont say wow
1,3Bronystate guild in GW2, yes
Xanbreon was buried alive :D
woot
was SWTOR any good?
HMM
Implying most MMO's aren't similar at the core.
hey guys whats up??
/me digs his way out >;3
WOW dat WOW
kirzstryfe: oh so what is guild mean like
Screw it, Imma buy GW2
SWTOR is going to be a F2P game in a year, thats what i think

I figure that ALL MMOs are pretty much the same, but have different objectives too.
02iDerp
sorry
1,3being in a guild in the game gives access to an in-game chat that only guild members can see
alexxm: swtor
its called "computer explorations" :|
:)
Is the stream working?
Idk if I could play in a brony guild at in an mmo unless it was actively clearing high level content.
exploarations meaning ponies
1,3Wrek is streaming, he just went to get food

13so I just went downstairs to the kitchen and found that all the fridge magnets were upside down
Oh, thanks

06but ... there's a severed bunny head and... a crocodile hat
06D:

Considering that they have source ported to Mac
Airpuff, I prefer Derpy+Pinkie... they run around and do silly stuff XD
02well, yeah. that's why I said almost XD
the protical son returns
02same goes for Android to iOS
poor sick woona
02Believe it or not
which means they have an OGL backend
6There is currently a total of 229 hats (excluding the 118 Miscellaneous items).

Porting from IOS to android is no cakewalk as well
lol kaito asdf movie xD
08,01er, phrasing
MadSurge: Hmpf. Might be true.. But i really like how she stands all satisfied and asking where she is ... + wobble wobble... xD
Kinky?
02I know
You generally at least have to redo the shaders
dragon's back
i know :)
08,01i mean actual sausage
/me hugs back
oh my o.o
08,01the kind you put in your mouth
6wait
err..
6TF2 on android?
02but they both use C++ and Java
Still
O_o
lol
HAHAHA!
sure...
6that sounds like a terrible idea lol.
08,01no love from wrekbot
06impossibru
You crack me up
there are 2 kinds O.o
Seems legit.
As well as other refactoring
XD I'll have to try her too then Airpuff

13Sexy new Terraria episode on youtube

06sexy sure fits in many situations and uses
08,01alexxm: i don't believe i have
13I'mma be quiet for the next 20 minutes, try not to miss me too much ;3
06just the way i like it.
06AND OKAY ;------------------------------;
Go port TF2 to OS/2 warp, pretty sure that uses C/C++
13You like it quiet? :P
Serious need for sausage is.. serious. xD
And im ignoring the whole porting from x86 to ARM as well
lol
Ooh, Black Adder would be a seriously awesome show for a stream
oh mah gawd xD
08,01girl, don' make me get all Molestia on yo bitch ass
do you have swap note?
06no i do not like it quiet ;-;
thats why i asked Jim
061,1play it loud
i love blackadder
Black Adder would be awesome
Blackadder xDD Epic
02[11:43] <Roara|Animating> that sounds like a terrible idea lol. <-- they would have to do it right
08,01Ninjazz: Scottish Molestia, at your service
:O
6there is no doing it right
08,01a very... specialised kind of service
ô.o
6TF2 on an android would be pure hell
Damn, those dragons are going to town
02it could be really bad if they didn't
08,01hey MadSurge!
08,01<3
i demand blackadder! ------- you guyz get me right? :p
:O lol
/me floofs Espeon
ofc
6TF2 is a game that actually requires precision shots
lol
Hey, who's streaming right now?
Hmmm. Thinking about a Scottish Molestia is very... interesting to say the least.
Don't demand, that makes fluttershy cry
6which touchscreen phones can not replicate
wreck is streaming
http://wildcritters.ws/data/efe88ef0b5f034bcc4d816462e483dc6.png?1295743739
Blackadder always sounded like a fun series to me
07precision
6the resolution isn't large enough
A "TF2" port to android wouldnt be TF2
07in tf2
its awesome
07lol.
it would just be a random fps
06terrifies me
6^
wrek*
i prefer season 4
08,01bitch, i'm so scottish, i roll my w's
06demoman and pyro would work the same though
06*rimshot*
xD
06nah
lmao xD
6kyu, I can be precise as hell in TF2
O U
it really gets good in series 2 in my opnion
xD
do do do
06I'm sure Roara can confirm I can as well
06also purple text master race etc
@pony
12RX-78|FireEmblem is 5Little Strong7heart
02[11:45] <Xanbreon> it would just be a random fps <-- fps aren't random on Android
6yeah if people don't know espeon's accuracy rate, they need to be edumacated
thats not a pony
08,01anyone who just tried to roll a w, meet me in my bunk.
07pretty much every class has spread in their weapons though |D
Ohhhmyyyy
oh noes
is he technicly loosing? -> wrek at wc2?
noooo!!
sigh
6spread yes, but there's still too much precision needed unless you're ok with grazing
oh gawd
dentidiot: do you have swap note?
Ninjazz that reminds me of a vid called Read It and Freak from the guy who did the Rage Rosebud and Johnny Bravo vid :D creepy but funny
guys if i dont come back...im sorry
06when in the intended range of a scattergun/shotgun
He's building up
06spread doesn't really matter if used right
kaito yeah
6but then we go into the fact that a SMALL game of TF2 would probably crash a handheld
02but Roara, you would be able to touch were you wanter to fire
i sent a note
k
02where*

kaito dosent it only work thorugh street pass?
wut
/me saves line to use it out of context
mfw wafcraft 1 on stream
6but the fact is, phone screens can not be large enough to mimic the size you need
Well, its more than the screens are to small
6...
Thankyou.
6espeon go die in a fire
02well, that would repend on the phone
I don't have the patience for RTS games XD

You can get 1080 screens these days

!espeon
/me still belongs to Kyu for 4 more minutes
Alight. Now who said what?
spotpass
6the only size screen that can do that would probably be an iPhone or tablet screen
07let's not forget the fact that you would need 3 hands to run, look, and shoot properly

@pony Meanwhile
6 Meanwhile is 7Ste6ven Mag7net

I have $105 in my bank account. Do I care enough to get GW2?

Moustache brothers
ahem, second attempt
6but back to what I was saying
Ninjazz: [19:47:21] <Sketch_Toku_Brony> Ninjazz that reminds me of a vid called Read It and Freak from the guy who did the Rage Rosebud and Johnny Bravo vid :D creepy but funny
Its called Read It and Freak if ya didnt get the name Ninjazz

@pony
12UnFoundBug is 5Doctor Whooves

oh nvm :$
Cobellanez: its haf of your acc
06tf2 on console, just worse
6if you could SOMEHOW get the touch shot done right, AND the movement/view/weapon switch controls, you need to worry about how much power it would take to run it
lol
06i still remember how hard it was to rocketjump there
why dont i get any good ones :9
Oh. Okay I see now.
Epic wub time is best wub time.

wtf...
02[11:48] <Roara|Animating> if you could SOMEHOW get the touch shot done right, AND the movement/view/weapon switch controls, you need to worry about how much power it would take to run it <-- most new Android phones are capable of PS2 graphics

Lucario sint a legendary

Jim, MahBoi777, and Sketch_Toku_Brony. That's "what", cow334.
06what
6^lol
07also, tf2 needs a minimum processor speed of 1.7GHz which is pathetic in computer standards
MahBoi777: moo
he got a film, and is beloved by furries though
07but tablets hover around 1GHz
a ferret bipedal with pointy metal things in his chest i think meanwhile
06Kyu that's
You are forgetting all the physics
06for TF2 on release date
Which uses a lot of CPU
06it becomes progressivele less optimized
/me spins
6TF2 on release, compared to TF2 of now
Yeah I'm looking it up.
Also you cant compare ARM to x86 clock for clock
06it seems
OH! You were talking about MrPoniator, Sketch_Toku_Brony?

Reddit, 4chan, Memebase, funnyjunk, what else?

02because some people are nerdy enough to want to? :D
it'd be like that old show "Butt-Ugly Martians"
oh no
i hated that show
LadyCanary: Yeah. Like, I might not be the biggest TMNT fan, but I still think it really odd that they would actually go ahead and change something like that. I wonder how the hardcore fans are taking it.
i rember that MahBoi777
@Meanwhilemeter
Yaaaay
07but not nerdy enough to know it would play like crap? :'D
Oh god MahBoi777, the memories
