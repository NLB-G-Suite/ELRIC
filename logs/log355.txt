HA!
oooh
hmmm
odd

just to make sure, anyone planning on streaming?
I'm a irl technomancer
1,3I still have a long way to go to be at the level I want to, but I've had a lot of practice in the last few months
for a second, I thought it was a reference from today's Regular Show
Law of Busom Motion
11,01I read irl as girl.
1,3it's the nature of the show I think
"Bosoms shall move with little effect, jostling for minutes with only a single effort"
Also, hay.
2,14 well, if no one else is streaming, I suppose I could take over for a bit
:)
Val is streaming?

i think you might be right about the nature of the show
the usually place I assume
law 43 Law of Quadrotriscadecophobia: There is no Law 43.
1,3hehe :)
well said Morty
I spy....errr.....something blue
laws of house- the 1st and 2nd diagnosis are never right
1,3while CoD attracts 14yo's with god-mode comlexes
1,3*complexes
more expressive people tend to develop outlets in the arts to express themselves
thus the most talented fanbase ever
ever?

well
^
not bad
just not great
/me is overjoyed with the addition of the ice cream and keeps eating
just said that i'd been watching it a bit much
To be expected with most old shows.
:3
and they are REALLY hard to find
1,3funny thing is, the quality was great 20-25 years ago
0,14ah, W-B-X, y u such a good opening?
:O
yea :D
1,3it just hasn't held up very well
:3
back when everything was analog

eat ALL the things
/me is hungry.

0,14it's kinda...jazzy
0,14XD
/me steals bag of brownies
Just kidding
O U
/me brohoofs the brownies into Placebo's face >_<
They somehow lost the rights to a few of them
saxy, planning on getting me3?
:p
/me takes all the noms, and pushes them somewhere else
1,3toy/show rights were really screwed up back then
I'm here
hurray
0,14Haven't played the previous ones >.>
forget you, I can eat all these sweets!
0,14I've heard amazing things about the series though
oh Saxy... i am disappoint
^
/me a few minutes later
nearly Altair's birthday
:O
0,14true, but I like to have a solid background when it comes to series like that
There's one of the mane six that's from G1 yes?
Hi, I'm Wilford Brimley and I'm here to talk to you about diabeetus:S
I'm going to replay ME 1 and 2 because I lost my saves, just to have an import.
well sax, you can get the previous ones for like $15 each
0,14I have no money >.<
damn you Wilford Brimley...:|
oh saxy saxy saxy, you make me sad
Sure
0,14I regret noooooooothiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing
spike is preent in most of the OS and some of the movies
/me spent her money on school books ;^;
1,3applejack was g1
:(
pinkie pie was too if i recall
1,3and twilight, but she had different coloring
Sugar Rush!
1,3yeah, pinkie too
i might have bought me3 but origin is a poo poo piece of poo
:D
and RD
Lol dragonage.
0,14...it would be ironic if I won my schools' SC5 tourney and used the money to get ME3 XD
doooo eeeeet Saxy
^
Lots of luck Saxy! Is there a set date for the tourney?
i believe that the reason most of the early G's ended
0,141st place is $50 GS gift card, 2nd is $25
personal favorite is adept, but i've done infiltrator, sentinal, and working on a vanguard
0,14and yeah, tourney is the 28th
is because spike couldnt stand them and ate them
awesome
i mean...look at the prook
0,14all day saturday
proof*
mordin is by far my favorite me2 squad mate
Saxy gots this!
0,14I'll do my best to win
You can do it Saxy!!
Like I said, Saxy gots this ;)
I believe in you! Kick Will's buttocks.
out of all the OS ponies, non survived each gen...but spike was found hibernating at the begining of each gen
^
1,3lol
oh. was thinking star craft. Lol
...Ooopsie xD
:D
lol
yea
:D dat star craft 5 :D
:D
I just want my SkullGirls. NOW.
>.>
1,3Equestrians reincarnate, canon
Sorry...
and several times hes found hibernating
/me takes in hate
0,14heh
Like a Baws
Dat tab fail.
hi
wash, rinse, repeat
I noticed.
Hmm..
no youdont
um
I'm not a nurse either
SPAH?
i refused to be renegade for that mission, punched him in the face, and still got his loyalty
....oh
2,14 if you're a REALLY high paragon
2,14 you can keep his loyalty
I'm sorry I can't stay on.
2,14 I've been here all the time -_-
:D
oh right...
^
^
2,14 it's the same with Morinth, though you can go either way
2,14 you just have to be REALLY high in it
/me is now lost in convo :p
I see.
ಠ_ಠ
Lets dumb down the conversation, then..
zaeed needed a really good punch in the face though
now you're speakin my language
2,14 dude, I don't blame zaeed at all
Cool story.
I see an analogy to R2D2 here.
Zaeed was driven by revenge
2,14 I'd be pretty fucking pissed too
spoilers.
Lol
2,14 phfff
but I wouldn't sacrifice the workers for it
1,3wouldn't that mean g4 is before g1 then, assuming it's the same universe?
2,14 oh noes, you know Zaeed was betrayed!
1,3since we've seen spike hatch
i doubt he considered him much of a friend, and i'd be pissed too, but you don't sacrifice innocent lives for it, thats now how i roll and its my ship
not how*
interesting theory
/me 13yawns und curls up by the fireplace
the series COULD be like star wars
/me decides to take shower while convo is still going
brb
4,5, and 6 now
yeah
"that one fight"
1,2 and 3 later
the wave fight
i dunno
that? that was easy
not for me
should have gone adept then
adept is master of crowd control
it wasnt for me... i was playing on hardcore >_<
Heh
and Biotics doesn't work when they have shields
13canary~
and thats why i dont like soldier, sure, you've got raw power, but you're lacking in options
that could also be why there are no witches in g4
cause they havent found the ponies yet
13but... we played "get SB's attention" last night..
PING
13or... TIMEZONES
It's important
then send him a pm
it got a little close near the end, but no great cause for concern
?
I'll brb.
Dat SuperBrony64's sister
1,3those are the fairy ones right?
yea
Is there streaming going on?
enope
I GOT IT
1,3well, depending on the time difference
1,3they may not have evolved yet
the residual magic
i've never done a playthrough of soldier, just doesnt feel right
Hmm...
AND those damn mechs
must have altered raritys DNA
1,3lol
Overload
and when she reproduced
nuff said
the Flutterponies where born
2,14 mechs are the best things ever
lol
a
2,14 hit them in the head, mini-nuke to clear out the room
Overload. Incendinary rounds.
/me loves her Deathscythe <3
Ooops?
1,3lol, das boot
#pinkie_pie
damn it
LOL
0,14like Gundam Deathscythe?
That
^
1,3that was it
Suddenly, Gundam Wing theme
got kicked for speed typing
I've done tests
Lol. Just type it all on one line rather than multiple lines
1,3more likely, the same type of magic was used on dissatisfied earth/unicorn ponies that wanted to fly
0,14Niiiiiiiice.
me
kills you
in
3 seconds
10 seconds flat
barrier is the adepts best friend
Geth Shield boost?
neat, i had one like that a while ago
soldier
also, I did too
13wer ist playing mass effect
but it took me a couple of tries
1,3if g1 is far enough away from g4 in the timeline, after Celestia/Luna disappeared and the ponies were left to evolve on their own, that could explain the rise of flutter/sea ponies
1,3and magic could have caused or sped up the process
13or... nopony ist streaming?
I really need see the old series.
No stream.
0,14no one's streaming
no stream
with a build for maximising for damage
13oh
I'm at a loss in most of this discussion.
0,14just Mass Effect discussion
or just leave?
06mass plot discussion
0,14...
if it was 1, no problem
06i balme sxyparetdner
0,14XD
:D
1,3probably ascend to a higher plane or something like that, considering the nature of the show
/me giggles
you can actually TANK in 1
meaning of live? THE PLOT!!!
2,14 I would have streamed ME32
2,14 2*
one of *
06tired, und sick, aber val <3
he has
noes!
0,14there's a ME 32?
/me 13crawls under vivi's mane und falls asleep -.-
I'd give you some good health
but I'm feeling unwell too
13nacht ponies

>spinning in circles
>still moving forward
Da fuck
Now I don't have any more internets
He heh he hhe.
sick
WATH!?
:O
Hopy shit.
WOAH
but can he think inside the chimney ?
NOW THAT IS DRIVING!
I've just noticed
Now this is pod racing.
Did I see Rainbow dash on his dashboard?
there's about 4 of them
woah
That's usual
You should see the amount of smoke from an engine failure
What's this?
Sometimes, there's bagger all, but sometimes, the place is flooded with smoke
how the FUCK?
Oh gawd
Spinning
:O?
ALOT
his back tires are gone.
00,10tires, now rubble
Lawl
QWHQJD:FJ!?
real men don't need tires
Awesome Radu
00,10today?!
He needs a pitstop
First time I've been to McDonald's three times in three months
Radu: they have fluttershy dolls?
Monster energy *rage*
Hopy shit.
Yup, today for me. But I'm in Eastern Europe
which part was that?
I need a pic of my face
00,10dead camera
I can't lift my jaw
THAT is waht we should be watching instead of Nascar!
43 guys doing this AT ONCE
Nascar = cars driving in ovals
1912
nascar is just a waste of gas
this stream is degenerating soo much.............................
Well, I gotta do some homework now.
Unot momento.
I'm thinking about watching Indycar
1917
as Boobens Barrichello has joined the parp-tay
:O?
TETRIS!
wtf hahahahahahahahahahaa
though full disclosure, i enjoy NASCAR as is
agreed, but you can't do Gymkhana for that long
NASCAR is more about consistency and speed than it is over pure performance
(at least it is now adays)
I must be honest, I fail to see how 40 odd cars racing in circles is intresting
Too early :O
lali-ho everypony
If it had some actual turns, like F1 or something, it would make it about 5 times more intresting
if you want to see some drifting just watch the x-games this year.
00,10There are nasscar road tracks
^
but they dont go that fast
Spaaaace
