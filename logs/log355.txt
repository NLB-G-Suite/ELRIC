the robots are the best characters evah
I just looked at the Hub TV schedule. The We <3 Ponies MARE-A-Thon won't start until 5 IN THE FLIPPING MORNING in my time zone! :O

A box of Toms would have more personality that the entire cast of Twilight.
MY BODY IS READY
SOMEBODY TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED?
dat OK!
Also, Ohai Bronystate
ohey GabeMoist
lali-ho GabeMoist
My lag is HORRIBLE

09,01the bots' AI were loaded into the GaoMachines so they could all perform final fusion
ah
fucking HORRIBLE lag
09,01not a Zonder, but it was because she was infected with a Zonder Seed during the first contact with them
otakon: then stop dling porn... lol
I'm not dling ANYTHING though

im not taking off yet just saying night to all the ponies about to hit the hey
This oddly reminds of Gundam
I voted everyday since my birthday; and I 'm not ashamed of it. :$
09,01the mechanical designer for this show was Okawara, I think
mario_pony: YFW the original of that is by Skrillex
1,3cool :)
09,01who did the designs for several Gundams
Hm
interesting
1,3I voted the first few days, then forgot about it >.<
09,01plus, studio Sunrise
09,01who also did Gundam
that is why this show is epic
Because Japan
I only missed two days; and that was because I couldn't find time to.

*know
That's your own internet problem
why has it taken me this long to figure out that NewDCD is the anime pony O.o
It isn't lagging for me
because it likes to make you complain otakon... it enjoys your suffering
1,3we may be streaming the marathon here, ponies are more fun with more people :)
your internet hates you :(
otakon, it's your internet's fault :(
AWWWW YEEEEAAAAAAAH
lol my internet is always slow but not during streams.
Because CenturyLink is a troll company
who let these trolls in the company
Brings a whole new meaning to internettroll
lol
mamoru is borked
I hope you do! I'd absolutly LOVE to watch FiM with a fellow brony/pegasister! I get a little lonely watching it alone. :(

Borked?
Lawlsies
I don't get it here
:'(
That little rat thang just got ate, damn robot, you scary!
1,3yeah, no cable here, so I rely on the stream and youtube to see pony :)

Why...

WHY?!
Then again, isn't FiM on Discovery Kids Channel all over the world? I know Brazil has that.
anime law 11 Law of Inherent CombustabilityEverything explodes. Everything.
^LOOL
Okay. Now he's Harry Potter.
what's going on now
TheDr, it's Mikoto Zondered
epic name
This > Nagasaki + Hiroshima combined
1,3I know in the US the Hub is a mix of Hasbro and Discovery Kids, after DK flopped
/me is not the biggest fan of anime "let the hating begin"
^ thats funny
Wait what is going on?
09,01folks
explosion

Actually, Tokyo survives quite often-- but the Tokyo Twoer gets smashed at least once a week.
.....
erryone nekkid
Good gravy! There naked!
So it would seem Kencolt. :P
It's more rare than Unobtainium
Law of Phlogistatic Emission: Nearly all things emit light from fatal wounds.
Is unobtainium difficult to obtain?
that kid just saw his brother naked.:P
I have no clue what is going on
More rare than Tritium from Spiderman 2?
this is why anima is so damn epic!
08,01TheDr: i'm choosing to read your name as "Thehdurr"
Pikachu destroyed the city
08,01:P
In a way, yeah.
the end
That's all you need to know about this movie
?? wait whaa?
Why can't I hold all these robots?
Well, Actually it's impossible to opbtain Unobtanium. However, it's rather easily aquired, gotten, gathered, and possesed.
and this is how cities are repaired so quickly in anime
Magnemite is now fixing everyting
They are rebuilding the city in 10 seconds flat
they even have a plan to rebuild tokyo, it's like they knew the city get's it's a ss beat everyday
SUDDENLY ROBOTS
THOUSANDS OF THEM

Dken2021 - depends on the jurisdiction
What is this?
you never too young in anime

That fat kid is on a leash

why are bronies so talented?
I'm a irl technomancer
1,3I still have a long way to go to be at the level I want to, but I've had a lot of practice in the last few months
for a second, I thought it was a reference from today's Regular Show
Law of Busom Motion
Eternal chaos comes with chocolate rain, you guys. CHOCOLATE. RAIN!!!
The Law of Vocal Amplification in Close Quatrers Combat: No matter the technique, style, or syetem, screaming like a maniac will at the minimum double the kinetic impact of any blow-- assuming the practicioner is sufficiently Cool. The Corrolary to this is the Law of Extreme Silence-- if you are unbearably cool, you can amplify kinetic impact by whispering. And glaring.
11,01I read irl as girl.
1,3it's the nature of the show I think
law 39 Law of Inverse Attraction: Success at finding suitable mates is inversely proportionate to how desperately you want to be successful. The more you want, the less you get. First Corollary Unfortunately, this law seems to apply to Otaku in the real world...

IngloriousPony89: it was pretty good, and Hazard3 that word does not exist here

emangamer : What?!
How dare you SayWhat. HOW DARE YOU?! :[
Borderlands 2 is AWESOME

You see Dungeon Defenders Phase4

Good

I dont think they've announced a sequel
IngloriousPony89: i wondered why there was a 'wave complete' message
Beware the Wyverns...
in Game Informer
So many great games I've played over the years. Dark Soul included. wish I had the time to replay some
I know Dark Souls is the spiritual successor to Demon Souls
Super Mario 64 is a fucking awesome game.Say I if ur still playing it.
well im going to bed godd night everypony.
I
Er.. other way arond
Night mario
BUILD/UPGRADE ALL THE THINGS
night mario_pony
cya mario_pony
11,01I haven't played SM64 in years.
night mario_pony
very fun game
I miss SM64, I need to play it again someday
What the hay is this game?
its what made the N64 so amazing
Dungeon Defenders
So few memorable N64 games out there.
It's a Tower defence with real time combat :)
corwyn
Mischief makers was good.
thats awesome
my fav is starfox 64
Mischief Makers! Shake Shake!
I got Supersmash bros for 5 bucks, sold it for 30
Liek a baws
My mom got Tropicana BERRY PUNCH
megusta
in Game Informer it says the best video game line up in history was the SNES with Super Mario Bros.
Well, yes, Memorable vs Good... One remembers the mistakes in life. Fortunately I never got that one.
Super Smash Bros 64 is probably the best, then Mario Kart, then Starfox, then Golden eye, Then SM64
RENT?!
I remember that Hazard3
Supersmash brothers, Blast Corps was another game that was interesting.
WHATS WRONG WITH YOU!
:'(
its ok
Has anyone here played Croc?
how far u get on ur rent Darf?
I WAS YOUNG!!! *sob*
Croc is probably my number 1 game of ALL TIME
Murder time in Dark Souls
:D
Except once beaten trying to get all platinum metals. I rented breath of fire so many times, always returned late because I wasn't finished yet.
I didnt have a memory card back then, so I never beat it
mfw I read Super Smash Bros as SuperBrony64
I'd love to replay the original Doom...but despite growing up on MS Dos, I can't for the life of me remember how to open files with it now
Darf14: its a very fun game but the stars get SCARCE!
Cypresswolf: it's called google
So nobody here has played Croc... What is wrong with this world? Am i the only blessed sould to every lay eyes on the holy game that is Croc?
is anything playing or is my internet just not wanting to work?
Refresh
I personally dont think SM64 holds up today...it was fun for the time but now it just gets rather repetitive
There's a stream of a game playing right now.
emangamer: ur right...still fun
I need a platform jumping game that doesn't have the character shouting woohoo every time.
Oh my god... I forgot it's almost 10 and i'm drink DP :P

http://therealmcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/1318824723348.jpg

MasterBrony: What's your story?
"It's not a TUMOR"
It's a goma!
Toy: my mom has lupus, do you mean if i show her derpy, she will be cured
Correction: "It's not a toomah!"
i was reading "zombie survival guide" while out getting a bite to eat today, when this chick walks up to me, stops, and says" oh, your one of those zombie nuts. i was going to give you my number, but your obviously crazy".....I looked at her and replied "thats ok, those jeans make you look fat anyway." grabbed my stuff and left.....

/me feels horrible now
Wait.. Why's the topic say Luna is best pony in Pinkie Pie's channel??
i didnt take it like that, i was jokingly talking even though it is true
Heh.
i dont see it
and my mom loves house
why so srs?
?
um
Oh okay, still sorry to hear that. Hope she feels better.
srry, just wanted to quote
Lupus is a real thing?
YES
Luna is a pretty good pony.
but it never happens
and WHY does it come up so much?
Luna is MINE
Yes, but Pinkie Pie is the best :D
NO TOUCHING
yes, Lupus is real
I have no Idea
otakon: You should know you is doctor otakon!
WHAT is "It's NEVER Lupus!"?
:|
....
Princess Luna is mai waifu
I'm not a doctor
She's standing atop my screen
hi Quilava
I've never heard of Lupus to tell yall the truth
did I miss something?

otakon is nurse then
Lupus is probably one of those things with more symptoms than cases
:3
hmmm
TO GOOGLE!

Apparently the latest episode was gonna be named Reading Rainbow
I googled Lupus some time ago, and if I recall it was interesting
I won't say what my desktop is then.

hai all the ppls!
yo Phase4 and SaxyPretender
/me puts ice cream in Midnight_Tempest's toast and peanut butter :p
Ingwaz: That's dedication, holmes.
but they are bad quality
Ingwaz: ah yes, the signs of TOO much pony
Ingwaz: you can never watch to much pony
well
^
not bad
just not great
indeed Phase4, didnt say it was bad
/me is overjoyed with the addition of the ice cream and keeps eating
just said that i'd been watching it a bit much
To be expected with most old shows.
:3
and they are REALLY hard to find
/me is eating a chocolate chip cookie
1,3funny thing is, the quality was great 20-25 years ago
0,14ah, W-B-X, y u such a good opening?
:O
yea :D
1,3it just hasn't held up very well
cookie
W B X?
/me noms on Placebo's cookie
:3
hmm... i got cookies upstairs too... >_< no... mustn't overeat
back when everything was analog
:(
instead of digital

I really can't remember any details from the original.
must haz ALL the cookies!
/me is hungry.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtqvwPTvx10&feature=youtu.be go to 4.08 its funny
SaxyPretender /) almost didnt see that for a second :3
0,14XD
Midnight_Tempest: Keep strong! *waves brownies in front of face*
0,14(\ LadyCanary
whats funny is all the characters from the OS that didnt survive the transition
/me gives LadyCanary bird food. Get it cause she's a bird? ;)
Double is my favorite.
I love going home for the weekend.. I come back with noms
/me steals bag of brownies
Just kidding
I am not bird. I am Black Canary!
O U
/me brohoofs the brownies into Placebo's face >_<
They somehow lost the rights to a few of them
saxy, planning on getting me3?
From what I understand
/me gives LadyCanary jar of cookies
:p
/me noms the cookies
/me takes all the noms, and pushes them somewhere else
you nom those cookies!
the OS had 3 witches, teh 2 sisters and brother, and some creepy gnome guy that lived in a mushroom
NOM NOM NOM
ohai otakon
1,3toy/show rights were really screwed up back then
yh
I'm here
0,14Can't say I am, Ingwaz
/me noms on cookies and cream ice cream
hurray
0,14Haven't played the previous ones >.>
forget you, I can eat all these sweets!
SaxyPretender: You need to. Now.
0,14I've heard amazing things about the series though
1,3g1 had spike too, and I think I spotted a pony with trixie's cutie mark in one of them
oh Saxy... i am disappoint
^
/me a few minutes later
you dont have to, you can jump in regardless and the game will fill you in on the basics
ohmygod
nearly Altair's birthday
MahBoi777 is Pinkie Pie?
:O
Importing your character >>>>> chosing a present
0,14true, but I like to have a solid background when it comes to series like that
There's one of the mane six that's from G1 yes?
Hi, I'm Wilford Brimley and I'm here to talk to you about diabeetus:S
I'm going to replay ME 1 and 2 because I lost my saves, just to have an import.
well sax, you can get the previous ones for like $15 each
0,14I have no money >.<
0,14I spent everything I had into Soul Calibur V
damn you Wilford Brimley...:|
already had to do that when my harddrive fried placebo, whats your favorite class?
want to hear my theory on spike vs g1 - g3.5?
TOY_PON3: I couldn't handle all that sugar
Ingwaz: I got ME and 2 other games for a total of 15 over a year ago.. lol
oh saxy saxy saxy, you make me sad
Sure
im not sure if i'll be able to use my ME2 save if ME3 isnt going to be on steam...
0,14I regret noooooooothiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing
spike is preent in most of the OS and some of the movies
/me spent her money on school books ;^;
1,3applejack was g1
not hatin on sc5, but me3 will be a better buy
:(
pinkie pie was too if i recall
1,3and twilight, but she had different coloring
Sugar Rush!
Ingwaz: My main playthrough was with Soldier class. I guess that's my favorite, because of the teammates I love to use
1,3yeah, pinkie too
i might have bought me3 but origin is a poo poo piece of poo
:D
and RD
Lol dragonage.
0,14...it would be ironic if I won my schools' SC5 tourney and used the money to get ME3 XD
you make me sad placebo, 80% of people who play me just pick the standard soldier
doooo eeeeet Saxy
theres so much potential in the other classes that i dont see why people dot hat
^
Heavy eez credit to team!\
Lots of luck Saxy! Is there a set date for the tourney?
i believe that the reason most of the early G's ended
0,141st place is $50 GS gift card, 2nd is $25
Ingwaz: I've also used tech and tech/biotic. But I love using Garrus, so I try to stay away from Tech..
personal favorite is adept, but i've done infiltrator, sentinal, and working on a vanguard
0,14and yeah, tourney is the 28th
is because spike couldnt stand them and ate them
awesome
i mean...look at the prook
0,14all day saturday
you better win Saxy
proof*
Ingwaz: GIVE me a Soldier any day
mordin is by far my favorite me2 squad mate
got to love the cracked out hamster
He did almost eat Rarity
Saxy gots this!
Ingwaz: His singing voice. xD
0,14I'll do my best to win
You can do it Saxy!!
Like I said, Saxy gots this ;)
they've apparently gotten a new voice actor for mordin....thats going to kill me on the inside
0,14just gotta keep training and learn Ezio
I enjoy the soldier, though. As good as your teammates are, none of them are as good of a shot as you are.
I believe in you! Kick Will's buttocks.
badaba baba bada space space wanna go to space
out of all the OS ponies, non survived each gen...but spike was found hibernating at the begining of each gen
new gen*
0,14yfw Will doesn't play SC5 XD
/me doesn't know what sC5 is.
Ingwaz: i always prefered Grunt and Zaeed as my squad
Soul Caliber
0,14SC5 = SOul Calibur 5
^
1,3lol
oh. was thinking star craft. Lol
...Ooopsie xD
:D
0,14aka my most anticipated game of the year
lol
Spike's the only one who stayed with each gen is he?
yea
:D dat star craft 5 :D
they dont have to be as good a shot as you are Placebo, i use my gun heavily and my powers heavily
0,14don't worry, Placebo, I find that's a common thing to happen XD
:D
I just want my SkullGirls. NOW.
/me hates Soul Calibur
>.>
1,3Equestrians reincarnate, canon
Sorry...
and several times hes found hibernating
SuperBrony64:
/me gives TOY_PON3 a shield
i loved Soul Edge and the first 3 Soul Caliburs
SaxyPretender: honestly, at first I thought you just mistyped Cs5, and it was some art-sy competition..
/me takes in hate
Midnight_Tempest: zaeed is a dick, he and I don't see eye to eye on our methods so i dont keep him around much
0,14heh
doctor_whooves127: O hai!
Like a Baws
Dat tab fail.
Does anyone know if SuperBrony64 is on?
so he eats the ponies, hibernates, then wakes up for the new generation of ponies
hi
hi DoctorTimeyWimey!
wash, rinse, repeat
DoctortimeyWimey: He hasn't been talking :s
I noticed.
so many doctors
Ingwaz, yeah same... but to get him to be loyal you have to be a renegade for his mission and one mission of being a dick is fine for me
Hmm..
we need nurse otakon!
hi doctor_whooves127
no youdont
um
Medic!
DoctortimeyWimey: Call him..?
I'm not a nurse either
SPAH?
i refused to be renegade for that mission, punched him in the face, and still got his loyalty
....oh
otakon is a patient!
DoctortimeyWimey: hi!
I would but my phone is dead if he comes back on tell him to call me.
0,14and suddenly ValtheJean
2,14 if you're a REALLY high paragon
2,14 you can keep his loyalty
I'm sorry I can't stay on.
/me hugs DoctortimeyWimey just bcause
2,14 I've been here all the time -_-
:D
oh right...
yo ValtheJean
ValtheJean: that was me, I was VERY Paragon
^
Paragon playthrough as main, Evil sonnofabitch playthrough for the "why the hell not"
i tend to do Zaeed's mission early in the game so i forgot about the high paragon thing
solid paragon as well, only time i use renegade interrupts in me2 is if the person drew a weapon on me, you draw a weapon on me and you're fair game now
^
2,14 it's the same with Morinth, though you can go either way
well Midnight_Tempest, if you import your me1 char and its got high paragon, you can still get by
Ah
2,14 you just have to be REALLY high in it
/me is now lost in convo :p
I see.
ಠ_ಠ
eeyup
Lets dumb down the conversation, then..
Aeiou!
zaeed needed a really good punch in the face though
my ME1 char was always neutral... about equal amounts of renegade and paragon
now you're speakin my language
2,14 dude, I don't blame zaeed at all
Basically, the game only rewards those who stick to one path
Cool story.
2,14 he gets shot in the face by his closest partner
I see an analogy to R2D2 here.
Zaeed was driven by revenge
2,14 I'd be pretty fucking pissed too
spoilers.
Lol
/me backs away from convo and noms on some more cookies
2,14 phfff
but I wouldn't sacrifice the workers for it
1,3wouldn't that mean g4 is before g1 then, assuming it's the same universe?
2,14 oh noes, you know Zaeed was betrayed!
Almost my birthday as well.
1,3since we've seen spike hatch
i doubt he considered him much of a friend, and i'd be pissed too, but you don't sacrifice innocent lives for it, thats now how i roll and its my ship
2,14 he only talks about it, like, every chance he gets =/
not how*
interesting theory
still i shit a brick at how awesome the DLC Arrival was... blowing up a whole system was badass
eeyup
ValtheJean: Quite a few folks haven't played ME, but it was sarcasm. so yeahh..
/me 13yawns und curls up by the fireplace
the series COULD be like star wars
/me decides to take shower while convo is still going
Maybe he just reverts to egg state with each major hibernation.
brb
Midnight_Tempest: yeah, but that one fight was bullshit
4,5, and 6 now
yeah
"that one fight"
1,2 and 3 later
thats real helpful otakon
/me puts a blanket over Shizuka
the wave fight
Ingwaz: I don't want to spoil
i dunno
that? that was easy
not for me
/me smack PonyFlare with a logic, that's now how dragons work :p ;)
i think kirz is on to something here
Shizuka <3
should have gone adept then
adept is master of crowd control
it wasnt for me... i was playing on hardcore >_<
Heh
Ingwaz: I didn't, I was a soldier
and Biotics doesn't work when they have shields
13canary~
and thats why i dont like soldier, sure, you've got raw power, but you're lacking in options
People everyone should hug SuperBrony64 ( use his username )
ah
thats what guns are for otakon
/me hugs SuperBrony64
Get his attention please c:
that could also be why there are no witches in g4
/me hugs SuperBrony64
cause they havent found the ponies yet
otakon: for a moment i thought you ment you were in the military
/me GIGA BRO HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGS SuperBrony64
Ingwaz: I did! but by GOD so many at once with NO support
13but... we played "get SB's attention" last night..
SuperBrony64: ding!
13or this morning..
SuperBrony64: ding!
His Steam is away.. so he's probably not even at the computer..
PING
13or... TIMEZONES
SuperBrony64: ding! ding!
It's important
SuperBrony64: DING
i didnt have any trouble with it, and at least i'm fairly sure it was on veteran difficulty if not hardcore
then send him a pm
sup everyone
but therein lies a new question
ohai Simon2
it got a little close near the end, but no great cause for concern
we're attempting to bug SuperBrony64
sup Simon2
DoctortimeyWimey: Why don't you just call him?
with copius pings to SuperBrony64
yo Phase4 MahBoi777
were the buck did the fluterponies come from
?
I'll brb.
1,3you kept SB up too late Shizuka :p
Dat SuperBrony64's sister
Ingwaz: hardcore, lvl 30
Ingwaz: i was also playing soldier class that time around... soldiers always need someone around for biotic support
indeed, lol
1,3those are the fairy ones right?
Midnight_Tempest: I NEVER used a biotic.
yea
Is there streaming going on?
enope
Garrus + Tali tech overuse.
I dun think so
I GOT IT
1,3well, depending on the time difference
well, a good solid biotic can usually take care of themselves, might take awhile, but we've got enough crowd control and firepower
1,3they may not have evolved yet
they had wings like rarity did from Twi's spell
Ingwaz: unless you've got a dozen guys bearing down on your position from multiple angles
the residual magic
i've never done a playthrough of soldier, just doesnt feel right
Hmm...
AND those damn mechs
must have altered raritys DNA
1,3lol
Overload
and when she reproduced
nuff said
heavy mechs...
the Flutterponies where born
2,14 mechs are the best things ever
lol
im
Placebo: more than one guy, nuff said
a
otakon, thats what careful placement of singularity, throws, shockwaves and pulls are for along with heavy smg supressing fire
/me wonders what's for dinner
2,14 hit them in the head, mini-nuke to clear out the room
Overload. Incendinary rounds.
/me loves her Deathscythe <3
Ooops?
Ingwaz: SHIELDS!
1,3she's a unicorn, she's more likely to have absorbed any residual and used it in a future spell
1,3lol, das boot
#pinkie_pie
thats what the smg is for
MahBoi777: Mah Boi
1,3she's a unicorn, she's more likely to have absorbed any residual and used it in a future spell
damn it
ValtheJean: did that, so much fun
LOL
0,14like Gundam Deathscythe?
what i miss?
That
^
1,3that was it
smg takes down shields and does so very effectively, powers then become available
Suddenly, Gundam Wing theme
got kicked for speed typing
but when you pop your head out and get shot 10 times in a second it doesn't matter
I've done tests
and that is a valid point
Lol. Just type it all on one line rather than multiple lines
otakon: yeah, smg's are really good at bringing sheilds down
1,3more likely, the same type of magic was used on dissatisfied earth/unicorn ponies that wanted to fly
dunno what to tell you otakon, i didnt have much trouble with it and it was at least on veteran, possibly hardcore
Yes indeed SaxyPretender.
1 guy can shred 1000 points of shielding in3 seconds
who's here because of MasterBrony ?
0,14Niiiiiiiice.
1 guy
So are a soldiers Cryo rounds
me
kills you
in
Wait, cryo? What are they called...
3 seconds
1,3we're discussing Equestrian history and evolution
otakon, bonus power, get barrier and pump it all the way up
10 seconds flat
Ingwaz: THAT WAS WITH BARRIER
barrier is the adepts best friend
Geth Shield boost?
neat, i had one like that a while ago
bc that's the ONLY way to get your shields that high
i dont think so otakon... i made it to the last wave before getting killed, on hardcore
Midnight_Tempest: class
perhaps you're thinking on insanity otakon
soldier
also, I did too
13wer ist playing mass effect
i wonder when the ponies will discover that people are real?
but it took me a couple of tries
1,3if g1 is far enough away from g4 in the timeline, after Celestia/Luna disappeared and the ponies were left to evolve on their own, that could explain the rise of flutter/sea ponies
1,3and magic could have caused or sped up the process
since even with the right ammo it still takes 4 shots to kill one guy with a Mattocks
13or... nopony ist streaming?
I really need see the old series.
Nope
No stream.
0,14no one's streaming
no stream
with a build for maximising for damage
13oh
hi Shizuka
I'm at a loss in most of this discussion.
0,14just Mass Effect discussion
i wonder if celestia/luna die?
or just leave?
06mass plot discussion
0,14...
yh, I liked The Arrival, but that one fight was bullshit
i want to stream ME2... but i dont have any of the video capture equipment needed T_T
if it was 1, no problem
06i balme sxyparetdner
dunno what to tell you otakon, i didnt die on it, it was a little tough right at the end, but that was it
0,14XD
:D
1,3probably ascend to a higher plane or something like that, considering the nature of the show
/me giggles
you can actually TANK in 1
dat vivi
13i balme lardclesita
meaning of live? THE PLOT!!!
we all blame sax VioletVanilla
/me hugs VioletVanilla "How are you dear?"

i know you dont SaxyPretender, which is why you're a disappointment to me
0,14;_____;
it's 1 20 am here
1,3they could do a lot more with them, but I think they're left to background roles on purpose
/me comes back with Rarity bathrobe
:p
Dumori: where does the time go?
OH LOOK a dragon moved into a mountain and is blacking out ALL of equestra, lets send 6 kids to take care of it
I ate it
cos I was hungry
06ValtheJean: eenope .-.
sounds reaonable
Time-eater, I get it:D
/me pats SaxyPretender on the back
reasonable*
Of course.
1,3with the mane 6 being watched over by the princesses, but given enough room to grow and mature on their own
And VioletVanilla!!!!!! So good to see you!
/me goes back to fix self
06LadyCanary~
<3 How are you feeling dear?
TOY_PON3: u broken?
Well, Luna did have one episode of her own this season.
/me comes back all neat and with monocle on
1,3one reason I really respect the show as it is now, gives a lot more respect to girls then many, many previous shows
Fancy!
06laryngitis, headache, other things
S2E1
06very sorrry i have not been around
how do the elements of harmony work?
its ok vivi, you just get better
1,3must have ponies >2
i think thats a good enough excuse VioletVanilla
through the power of friendship
Vi it's nice to have you back ಠ_ರೃ
No need to apologize my dear!!!
/me hugs LadyCanary
It's perfectly understandable.
Rain <3
Luna and celestia used them once to trap discord
0,14Oh hai Rain
1,3I'd hate to live forever
so, whats going on?
Chocolate Rain
Nope.
/me is fancy once again
ಠ_ರೃ
awww
VioletVanilla: good lord, you too?
hiya Rain
nice segue btw
the fanciness has been restored to chat
1,3lol
Good evening Rain ಠ_ರೃ
I blame sxyprtndr
06nice to see you all as well
what is wrong with VioletVanilla? >_>
celestia trapped discoed once
1,3Celestia had Luna with her to rule Equestria, but had to banish her
/me hugs VioletVanilla
Rain: she's ill, like me
hi VioletVanilla
that sucks :<
0,14Everybody gotta get better ;_____;
it does
what was stopping her from doing it again?
trying
as a side note
but the weather is not helping
SaxyPretender: Indeed ಠ_ರೃ
luna WAS back when discord showed up
So fancy.
1,3*long text mode*...
quite
;)
Such class
indeed
such eloquence
i say old bean
/me waits.....
my word
oh yes wuite
06-16c here otakon
...Daaaaaaaaaaaamn
o.o -16c?
thats cold
Haha
06it opens up massive. .
/me giggles
0,14Yoshi?
VioletVanilla: it's not that cold here, but the weather has been so variable hay fever has spread early
I dare say that's rather chilly
/me nods
1,3when Celestia had to banish Luna as Nightmare Moon, that would've broken their connection with the EoH, which was noted that's how they defeated him before, and the EoH found new hosts in the mane 6
Coughing, sneezing, hacking, headache, body ache....
argh
I feel like crap
0,14;n;
on a stick
D:
/me is sad.
0,14feel better! ;n;
I'm trying
Gentlemen
0,14That goes for everyoooooooooooooone
AH-HA!!! a valid point appears.....
VioletVanilla: I apologize for my sudden laugh :(
1,3since the EoH were with new hosts, Celestia wouldn't have been able to call upon them 1: without Luna at full strength, and 2: without harming the mane 6
been drinking lots of water and taking medicine
VioletVanilla: have you been to the doctor dear?
Good good.
1,3hehe, had this part of the discussion back when s2 started
┌─┐
0,14Let my burning spirit guide you to recovery!
┴─┴
0,14also oh hai GabeMoist
nice try MahBoi777
Ohai Saxy
/me curls up and falls asleep
hiya GabeMoist
ok, as a curious question.....what good was it doing to have celestia keep hold of them?
/me feels bad but sees money and smiles
:)
Is eny one else seeing a black screen?
otakon: LOL all I need is a tophat!
thats a very good point btw
I feel like I arrived shortly after disaster has fallen upon Bronystate
/me puts a blanket on Rainbowjack
0,14no stream atm, Noir
no streaming
hi Noir!
Ah
long time no see
Hey
we got to about the same point when i was talking with some other guys about this
/me smiles and cuddels the blanket
1,3keep them from losing them probably, and they're supposedly a myth/secret and very important to Equestria
/me gives money to stream but it won't show anything
Hmmmm...
its not a stripper TOY_PON3|Fancy
try yelling at it!
Want more money stream? ಠ_ರೃ
or punch it!
different reasoning though, we were focousing on the timeline of luna/celestias apearence and when discord showed up
/me does . .
OOH!
1,3pretty sure RBD would leave it lying around, Pinkie would probably lose it, and Rarity would be showing it off with anything she could
well, she didnt do a very good job, as discord got them
or trying yelling AND punching it!
try eating it to steal it's power
um
/me gives VioletVanilla check for 100,000,000 dollars
There ;)
well discord is Q
I say sir, are you implying that the chat is a harlot?
that'll just give him indigestion
indeed
maybe you will get better soon
That's a bit rich
its not fair to expect her to survive against Q
q is John deLancie
What I wonder is if Luna & Celestia had another 4 ponies on their team when they used the Elements
brb need a drink
1,3god of chaoes, since Luna was (theoretically) still recovering, she may not have been able to act against him
and some advil
from waht i understand
/me invests in ponies so became rich
is they did not
/me snugels the blanket
1,3they've yet to be mentioned at least
invested*
you shall become wealthy
maybe luna and celestia have other Bro/sis ponies
0.0
Maybe
1,3and if the 2 goddesses had to work together to stop Discord, if he caught Luna unawares right after his escape she may not have been able to do anything
so
/me gives MahBoi777 book, "How To Invest in Ponies by Fancy Pants" There you go chap ಠ_ರೃ
theres something about a candence who is suposedly going to apear, its all rumors from what i know
i just want luna to have more air time
a good read indeed!
^
1,3Princess Cadence
Heh
he showed up and made friends
did i spell that right kirzstryfe ?
then dissapeared, never to be seen again
1,3rumors are something about a wedding, if you go by the playset info that has come out
MasterBrony: he?

how is everyone?

Bronies have a major effect on the show.
I have an interment phobia of sleep
/me Turns Midnight_Tempest into a rug again, uses it as a blanket
so many references we get, they make.
Something that removes it will make my life much better
o.o
Without Bronies I believe the show will already be cancelled
such a good community
^
/me smoothers Placebo as a rug
Silly filly, Placebo's doen't need oxygen
We also give hasbro and the writers ideas to use in their episodes, together with the community and hasbro we can keep this show alive for 5+ seasons.
^
big effect
that would be awesome
It will happen
if it happens MLD was right.
I think the killer is going to be lack of material.
also, ponies exist.
:>
whoa, 5+ seasons? that's probably more seasons a girl-geared show wishes to get to
Well s3 is 50% length
/me turns back to normal and jumps up and down on Placebo

Ha ha, oh wow.

OH hell no

What the crap is lucemon doing here?
Wasn't he the digimon that devoured the digital world a few seasons back?
09,01XRos Wars is an alternate world
That would explain it
is digimon still around?
09,01apparently Tai from S1 appears in XRos Wars: The Boy Hunters that Jump Through Time
So it's set in the first seasons world?
09,01not as a regular character, but Digimon has had alternate-world-traveling-shenanigans since S02
Tai is still around thaT G1 gangsta!
lol.
True dat
09,01yeah but this isn't the same Digital World as any of the other series
That would explain why lucemon isn't a dick and planning to blow the frack out of the human world
Time travel 'n' stuff.
09,01Taichi is the one that went through them worlds and stuff
09,01also I love the role of humans in this show
You mean the fact they have a role?
09,01the only one who actually does something is Taiki, who is their "General"....basically a Tactician
I'm gonna go npw
now*
Cya later everypony
bye pinkiepie101
Stop right there criminal scum.
holy shot
09,01the other two humans are here by accident...but the other boy is a badass, going to BATTLE with the other digimans as well
I remember when shoutmon got stabbed in the stomach
09,01Zenigata Tsoujirou
You should have paid the fine.
I was like "Whaaat?! They allowed that?!"
Hmmm. Mmmm. It keeps skipping for me.
I remember when wizardmon died
I was all like "nuuuuuuuuuuu"
Wizardmon, i don't remember seeing him in any series
Any other*
I think it might be an outdated season final of season 1 don't quote me on that though
I have not kept up on digimon over the years
au revoir everypony

Vinyl Scratch of corse
are there seassons in mythbusters?
disconnection whenever it's 12:00am... anyways, hi everyone

these episodes were from back in... 2004?
yeah,im.leaning.to.Vinyl.now
00,10they have like 11 seasions
I prefer both.
who's streaming?
hiya Simon!
Simon: guess
sumi.i.think
@ot: that would be a first
cuz I never heared about "The new seasson of Mythbusters!!"
DJ-P0N3 would be a stage name.
deadhoar5: why.all.the.periods.?
Mythbusters? Watched it up to Season 9
otakon: Also relevant: http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_losp57dW0C1qha245o1_500.png

does anyone got a problem where the server disconnects whenever it's 12:00am?

00,10I would say use the tab key instead but that could be intersting with auto compleat
.no

Seening paips
deadhoar5: yesh

00,10tab key is normaly used for inserting 5 spaces at once in a text field
ALSO! Is ANYONE interested that Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning comes out?
I've been using too much tab lately
I am stoked
anyone.know.how.i.can.fix.my.spacebar?
I don't even know what it is.

00,10Reminder new pony ep will air 30 min later then normal this week.
I've heard of it, it looks great
?
Sumica: so this is the first season of mythbusters?
Queen_Rarity: explain
I wouldn't recommend pouring soda on it. That does not help.
Dead - use a hammer
00,10yep ScootalooWonderloo
Trust me.
Sumica: cool
If a hammer helps fly the TARDIS, it should fix your keyboard
Am I missing an eyebrow?
take it appart
Krakass: no.crap
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L20Zs7_NIc&feature=related
You mean soda doesn't help fix electronics? :O
soda + mentos!
Rubbing alcohol or something else the evaporates readily may help.
test the button, if it doesn't respond you need a new keyboard

Where am I?
Fazana - Indy 500 really doesn't apply

Chell?!
Indianapolis doesn't have that much banking
Oh, it's this place.
How do I keep on ending up here?
Such a boss rally drifter.

I bet RD gets off on this kind of going fast stuff.
Now I don't have any more internets
He heh he hhe.
Sumi, you're streaming right?
I have them all away :c
00,10can you 360 in a box? he can

So much petrol
WATH!?
Look up Rob Dyrdek car kickflip next. :3
:O
Hopy shit.
Screw that, Mark Webber Backflup
WOAH
but can he think inside the chimney ?
ok... this guy is bloody amazing
NOW THAT IS DRIVING!
I've just noticed
Now this is pod racing.
indeed - what makes this impressive is that he is perfectly incontrol of this thing
whats the name of the video?
Did I see Rainbow dash on his dashboard?
00,10only pinkie and badass solger can do that TrixieMuffin

moop: ken block Gymkhana THREE something like that
MirrorImage: thanxs
my god the SMOKE
That's usual
otakon - yes, nothing like contributing to the polution in the general vicinity
You should see the amount of smoke from an engine failure
diddutz: thanks
What's this?
This is pure awesomeness
to do a drift... on an incline like that is madness
THIS IS INSANE!
Jim - Car Porn, lets leave it at that
Sometimes, there's bagger all, but sometimes, the place is flooded with smoke
how the FUCK?
Oh gawd
Spinning
his tires are dead
otakon - 4 wheel drive helps

his back tires are gone.

I can't lift my jaw
THAT is waht we should be watching instead of Nascar!
otakon - nah, combine the two
your jaw is now the floor otakon
Ohai tetris theme
43 guys doing this AT ONCE
Nascar = cars driving in ovals
MirrorImage: my god
1912
nascar is just a waste of gas
this stream is degenerating soo much.............................
Well, I gotta do some homework now.
MirrorImage: That might just be crazy enough to work
Unot momento.
I'm thinking about watching Indycar
1917
as Boobens Barrichello has joined the parp-tay
:O?
Sumica: that was the most awesome thing I've seen recently
TETRIS!
wtf hahahahahahahahahahaa
though full disclosure, i enjoy NASCAR as is
MirrorImage: NASCAR has NOTHING on what we saw just now.
agreed, but you can't do Gymkhana for that long
NASCAR is more about consistency and speed than it is over pure performance
(at least it is now adays)
I must be honest, I fail to see how 40 odd cars racing in circles is intresting
im a Czar
nascar needs to be put out of its misery... its so boring and needs MOAR DRIFTING!
Der Führer is dead, the world is now red.
Fazana - eh... it's a redneck thing
Too early :O
remember, NASCAR was born from people running Moonshine back in the prohibition era
this is like the russian revolution
lali-ho everypony
ohai Dken2021
If it had some actual turns, like F1 or something, it would make it about 5 times more intresting
if you want to see some drifting just watch the x-games this year.
00,10There are nasscar road tracks
Fazana - again, NASCAR is about speed rather than performance
^
but they dont go that fast

Midnight_Tempest - it has a "final boss," that's all that matters
