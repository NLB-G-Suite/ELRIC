Alchemist: Seems legit
Schrödinger's pony is dead and/or alive
Schrödinger's pony is alive, dead, alive and dead, and neither all at the same time
It's neither dead nor alive
Alchemist slap them in the Face... with Chemistry...
But it turns out there are two lists of the prerequisite table and the two are different and they say I looked at the "wrong" one.
Funfact: Schrödinger used his "cat" example to disprove quantum mechanics
Laptop overheated. AGAIN.
Hooray for powering through three hours of sleeps and meds
Cobel is it an HP?
You guys aren't taking this very seriously...
Dell
Laptop
Ahh, just as bad
Heres a thought
So they screwed up and they want to blame it on me.
Make a laptop ABLE TO BE USED ON YOUR LAP

What?
02Even tho it's not a battle song
It's a program that lets you make another computer
02It would fit good enough for one
But you have to have the setup disk for whatever series you're using.
inb4 Inception reference
Computers making computers? I don't like where this is heading...
Its just that my laptop overheats when I play games whiles its on my lap
Oh no, it's perfectly safe
/me rests his case
You set up how much memory you want it to have.
Gaming laptop is an oxymoron
I've now got an icepack on my crotch
Yeah. Taking AI classes makes you realize just how unlikely a robot uprising is. Sigh... :(
Lol
But that takes up actually memory from your computer
6is this about to be a fight theme battle?
It's useful for playing outdated games
I was wondering why everyone was so quiet.
Well, that's another crap day outta the way. =_=
IT must be tuesday
what happened GilDash
Alot of people I hear are using virtual machines as cloud servers because if they crash it's like MEH
Unfortunately...I don't think you can get internet
alexxm: Not much... Just still tired from yeserday basically.
hello there GilDash :3
Which leaves me stuck because I have to register the computer in order to actually do anything on it
"Well I've got email and Google...now I just need to download the rest of the internet." O_O
Hey GilDash

Petrified_Discord yeah atleast it would be something
GilDash: pretty good band choice, mate! :$
Listening to Disturbed and watching my flatmate work is kinda fun <3
MadSurge: Saw them at Download only on Sunday. Dave Mustain is a fucking legend. :)
Shimmer: OMFG, Disturbed! :)
MadSurge GilDash obviously likes metal and what not :P
killerpony7733: I'm one hell of a mosher when it comes to metal. :)
GilDash ;)
GilDash: yeah, i can see you as a mosher, lo
*lol
Sylandest: Seriously! You should have seen me at Black Sabbath! Never stopped! :)
hmm
seems legit
GilDash: I went to Gods of Metal with my brother last summer, Motorhead-Slipknot-Iron Maiden as the last three bands :$
MadSurge: Oh, fuck yeah! :)

GilDash: Best concert I've been to yet!
I'm not the Metal kind of guy XD My music is more like that: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ded5dFsKD7c&feature=related

Here, you can have half of my immune system

ahhh. much better :)
DuskStarshimmer medical insurance
SomeRandomPony: Then you can have half of mine. :)
02Mfw: http://puu.sh/dP3j and http://puu.sh/dP4p
GilDash i got a too good immune system i hardly get sick and when i do it knocks me out bad else i will be sick free almost a whole year
I could tell you why, but it would be violating my own ban on politics.
Hooray for autoimmune issues \o/
My white blood cells, they are made of STEEL! :[
FillyFlam, Can I share your polotics ban?
So no one is streaming at the moment?
killerpony7733: I've had flu twice that I've literally just shrugged off like it was nothing. :D
who will talk to me?
DuskStarshimmer: Please do, lol. Internet political discussion tend to end...badly.
I was laways sick when I lived with my parents. then I moved in to an apartment and I got heqalthier :D
03LOL really tiny pictures that have larger versions on imgur
GilDash i kinda feel like a extremely immune system is both a gift and a curse :D
Alchemist: Quite normal, that
I am convinced my room is bad for me. I always wake up with a blocked nose. :S
extremely good*
halo???
Alchemist: lolyeah. I remember on my very first break from college my parents got me sick :D
GilDash: sorry for late reply, got pulled away. You need to definitely get some fluids in you and some medicine or something
02I know, but I like to resize them for storage problems.
02not enough space, lol
killerpony7733: I manage to pick up colds like no one's business, but they never really affect me, so... I guess I'd rather have the crap colds really. :D
03the internet has practially unlimited space :P
GilDash: i hate colds...i have a rough enough time with allergies
Sylandest: Please, it'll be a runny nose again. I can handle a cold or two. ;)
Sylandest: I once had 3 colds in a month. *That* was fun. :D
GilDash: Fair enough, hehehe. I just dislike seeing a friend ill :$
so still no stream then
GilDash: geez! :O
hey everypony
GilDash hahaha yeah all i really have had was a few major sicknesses that knocked me out quite badly in total i may have been sick less then 5 times in a whole year
6technically, making a copy of something uses more space anyways
/me has not been sick since last year
13I hate when Photoshop decides to lag >:/
6or else i completely misunderstood you lot
03well I think he means he gets rid of the originals
Petrified_Discord: yeah they are usually over protective and dont let you build up an immune system. I had to save some cash so in the winter the avregae temp was around 10°C in my apartment to save on the bill and I built up a quite strong immune system :D
03but if it were me, I'd just bookmark them
AlienEd27: you just jinxed yourself, lol
02You completly understood. I ->had<- the bigger versions
02but I resized them and deleted the bigger ones
02since I have like 1gb left
my days been really good watched mlp earlier

Since we're talking about illness now; The last 2 days I've had back pain that reminds me of a muscle knot, only 5 times worse pain, anyone got any idea what it could be?
AlienEd27: lol, its a joke. You said you haven't been sick all year, so now you're gonna get sick soon :D
/me is terrible at social interactions

lolololol

I'm thoroughly medicated right now because of my back and other areas

And I get them frequently
12I see so everything has expired or something now? XD
Chrysalis: and you are like a vampire. running from any source of light.
Sylandest: Tsk, you know me better than that. ;)
03no, it's like, if you register a nick now it won't expire
03or something
killerpony7733: Yep. Not even joking.
GilDash: well, I sorta do, ehehe :$
GilDash isn't that a medical condition then?

am i the only one?
dafaq 6_9, how do I internet properly?
killerpony7733: I only seemed to get them every 5 months or so and haven't had one in 3 years. I reckon it was just hormones acting up.

/me flies back to your head
I'm liking the medical topic we've got going on here. Very interesting :)
02:3
Just a pain in the ass when you can't even take painkillers because you can't keep them down. >_<
Meningitis is even more fun

passed out from pain once
that was unpleasant
Chrysalis: D:
14hellooo...
/me flops
has anypony else here had visual distortions when you have a headache?
Chrysalis: I know that feel. Can't take painkillers because I hurl, can't stand up, can't really rest my head, can't bloody see... And it hurts like all hell. :(

Alchemist The liver cells are the most robust and fastest regrowing human cells, you can be a heavy drinker for 5 years an when you suddenly Stop, it will take 1 month to fully regenerade, you could even cut off 1/3 of the liver and it will regrow
GilDash i get them if i stand up wrong
Protip, dont eat fast food :S
GilDash: is there anything to be done for them then?
SomeRandomPony: That's what I get. It just doesn't go the fuck away, then goes all over my vision. Hence blindness.
DuskStarshimmer: slow food > fast food
14my arms hurt
14and shake a bit
seriously, for a while i didnt sit down, not cause the sitting down was a problem, but i was scared of the pain from standing up
/me hugs Chrysalis.
nopony pays attention to me, well, story of my life :P
Lil_B: well, nonetheless I dont like taking any sort of medication let alone extra strong ones...
AlienEd27: my apologies, i missed your message
meh, tis alot better recently, as with anything you can learn to manage it
Alchemist understandable :/
03Most anticipated episode in this series, hopefully it's good XD
/me pays attention to AlienEd27 O_O
AlienEd27: ive never really had visual distortions before, myself
Chrysalis: I never really had them long enough to. Pain is one of the few things that gets to me easily. :S
Sylandest: They're not fun. :(
For all you sickies out there http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8_pkvlcRTE
GilDash: I wouldn't imagine them to be. I'm sorry you all have to deal with so much trouble. makes me feel rather bad, somehow
yeah, i havnt gone back to the doctors after i came off my anti-depressants
Sylandest never had your heart stop, and then start beating again?
Sylandest: Trust me, mine were probably nothing compared to Chrysalis.
O_O
I get Migranes when: a) Fast weather changes, b) REALLY Hard work for a Long time (or an heavy sport activity for a long time) or c) when i don't drink enough water
AlienEd27: A couple of times, I think. Probably not good really. :D
Worst pain I've been in was when I had meningitis
AlienEd27: no, I cant say I have. that sounds terrifying
SomeRandomPony: Is that not poisoned blood?
Gil, wat
Worst pain I ever experienced was taking my ex to a Justin Bieber concert.
2 hours...
02SOITAL
:D
02ARE YOU THERE
GilDash: so it would seem...you know, only for you lot would I somehow feel guilty for feeling good, you know that? :$
Sundaysmile wow, i feel for you
You brought that on yourself
i would take all the pain i do if it lets me avoid that
love makes you do stupid things

Sylandest: Eh, it's no shakes. I've been extremly lucky in all other areas of health, so I'm grateful really. :)
Sylandest it is, got freaked out yesterday since i noticed that my heart wasn't beating, and just when i tried to move it felt like it was going to be ripped appart 6_9
hey pyrocatboy hows your day been
Chrysalis Well, I think its Migration caused by Dehydration, because the Migrane stays even hours after i drank enough water (mostly until the next day)... drinking to much water can also cause Migrane
AlienEd27: I take it you have a heart condition then? thats what im understanding here
everything in moderation as they say
GilDash: well, then thats good. We just gotta look out for the few rough patches you have then :)
OOOO
I take atenolol for my heart condition
AlienEd27: Doctor. Now.
Sylandest , you really think so? i'm not overweight or anything...
new PMV Mini Madness: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17YKUp-0Ip4
AlienEd27: what Gildash said. Go see the doc. A irregular heart rhythm is no joke, especially if it stos
*stops
Sylandest: Like I said, I haven't had one in 3 years. As far as I'm concerned, I'm all clear. :)
i'm going to die.... fuu.... :'(
GilDash ever tried to have you heart skip a few beats?
GilDash: well, then thats good too. :) I'm glad
Genetics screwed me over. I have so many hereditary problems.
Alchemist: That's how I look at it.
I'm 15! how can i have a heart condition when i am a active 15 year old!? 6_9
02ANYWAYS
02http://d24w6bsrhbeh9d.cloudfront.net/photo/4459088_700b.jpg
AlienEd27 yes
Alien could be genetic
I know a nine year old with a pacemaker, it's not uncommon
02So true
killerpony7733: It's felt as though it has, but I seriously doubt it *actually* had.
AlienEd27: You can still get one.
I've had one all my life, but didn't discover it till much later
6LOL
AlienEd27: I once knew a kid who died at 14 from a heart condition. He was the best footballer int he shcool too.
yeah... when i think about it, had a cousin with some sort of leak in his heart.
6thats so fabuloud
well, i still have
6fabulous
Although that's IF it's an irregular heart beat. Sometimes, depending on your position you can't feel your own heartbeat. Best thing to check, is your Pulse instead
he's not dead, luckily
GilDash i tried it once while waking up in the middle of the night i was slightly awake and i suddenly felt my heart stop and i couldn't move and i near fell into panic but after 2 or 3 seconds it strarted again :D
AlienEd27: I don't want to scare you, but you should go and see a doctor.
GilDash i agree
AlienEd27 that might be best
Panic attacks can make you feel like you're having a heart attack
indeed
o-o
ouch
GilDash , i think it's just because i didn't breathe in a normal pace, my heartrate sinks when i don't breathe fast enough
I still suffer from anxiety attacks too
I've had enough of those @_@
trying to deal with someone whos panicing is really tough
logic no longer applies
AlienEd27: Regardless, it shouldn't be skipping beats like that.
my heart wiring is messed up
indeed Chrysalis, most become hypochondriacs *spelling
GilDash aw buck...
Sundaysmile: You got it right :)
Chrysalis: The best you can do is try to comfort them and give them some space. :S
there was a dog attack on my street last week, poor gal had massive puncture wounds on her arm
couldnt get a word of sense out of her
GilDash i got this condition http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pectus_carinatum
asked me to put one of the dogs involved in the living room, with a god damn baby in there
Chrysalis: I doubt you could. Dogs used to absoultely *terrify* me when I was young. I never knew any dogs but friendly ones either.
My sister in law was in a similar situation. she panicked first then went into a shock when we got a coll that my brother had a car accident.
yeah, bull mastifs arnt the most friendly of dogs
bbl
Alchemist ouch, was he OK?
he was fine (though it was a miracle he wasnt hurt)
im back
I have scheuermann's which gives me a lovely odd walking motion
hey Bronysith hows your day been
A drunk driver slammed him against the railings on the highway.
hi Bronysith
/me crash glomps into alexxm
alexxm: good
/me hugs Bronysith bacj
GilDash checked the wiki page on that condition i have?
/me hugs Bronysith back
Alchemist good to hear he was OK
killerpony7733 i did
someon there
?
killerpony7733: Yeah. Weird. :S
killerpony7733 for anything like that, going online to search yourself is generally a bad idea, going to a doctor is a far better idea
I need to have food now. See you guys in a few. ;)
Chrysalis: yes. and the bastard got a 1 year sentence because he already had his license pulled for a DUI earlier that year :D
At the Gala!
maybe
GilDash: we'll be waiting! :)
Actually i'm diagnosed with it so i know what it is
:O
I love the list of problems on the visit summaries from my rheumatologist

does anypony else have two haircolors?
AlienEd27 i do,
AlienEd27: Not me.>_<
i don't
GilDash it's funny to have being born with a genetic defect that isn't harmful but instead just gives me two different eye colors :D
i wis i did
i got brown, fading to red on the end
you do Chrysalis ?
14Staraptor :D
killerpony7733 thats SO cool to see when people get 2 eye colours
Chrysalis: Wow, that sounds like a cool color combination then.
2Halloo :3
AlienEd27: I have brown hair, but my facial hair somehow has red hair...not sure how that happened
twilight can be the best pony today :3 <3
I have two colors in the same eye
lol
DuskStarshimmer: Not to me.:3
Yup, when i finally get around to re-dying it im going gonna go for the end
SomeRandomPony how does that work
03ohai
i can change my hair colour by changing how i have my hair, brown when up, red when down
brown hair, blue eyes. Mundane and boring ftw
/me glomps LoyalDash, fine *shrug*
green ring round the pupil and blue ring around that
14how are you?
DuskStarshimmer: Dat glomp.:D
well, i was talking more of having Blond hair, but on the right side of my head i had a palm sized spot of black hair
Chrysalis wanna hear the worst part people don't notice it but when they do. they feel very surprised i also kinda wished i could show you the pattern my eye color is in >_<
alexxm: heterochromia iridum
thanks Sylandest
Drf
03?
My teacher is a boss
alexxm: you're welcome :)
killerpony7733 what colours are they?
Sylandest: Same here :D red facial hair, wtf
Ao much onbeat echoes *melts*
She wasn't allowed to have an end of the year event
MadSurge: ...wat.:D
But she was like "f*** that"
MadSurge: Ikr? I checked my heritage and it kinda makes sense, yet it still confuses me
And we got 4 pies anyway LOL
03heh
alexxm i got the same condition as somerandompony
LoyalDash: me and MadSurge have red facial hair, and we're not sure how that happened
I don't have heterochromia
Okay, i don't have a heart condition, it's all tied to my breathing pattern
And on top of that
alexxm i read threw the Wiki-Article that got posted, these different colours can be partial, like only a Stripe in one eye
I'm suppose to be in Gym right now.
Love's In Bloom > this day aria :3
ok killerpony7733
Sylandest: I'll side with Twilight magic as the answer to that question.:3
But NOPE.avi
LoyalDash: hehehe, works for me! :D
Sylandest: Yesh, it sounds reasonable enough.
Sylandest: Luckily I'm a very un-hairy guy and I can't get past "shitty stubble" :D
I'm fine as long as i don't go from a close-to-sleeping state and right into activity
LoyalDash: wait, does that mean I have magic now? 6_9
Chrysalis from my eye view my left is blue right is 95% green with a tint of blue somewhere in the corner of the pattern
Sylandest: Umm, yes.:)
MadSurge: full goatee here XD
killerpony7733 awesome

Sundaysmile: It actually does a lot, kind of similar, so to speak.
Anyone here watched Animaniacs when they were little?
LoyalDash: I like it, its very matching, lol
sounds cool

SuperGotenks1989: yo
Of course.
Yo Sylan.

Sylandest: I had that amazing one of her against the wall with the purple wings painted on for a good while. My current wallpaper is... *ahem* different. :$
necroponies
i have to add pictures to my brony article do you guys think a picture of dusty would be a good idea
03problem is, unlike Craigslist, you can't meet the person to verify the item is legit
03>_>
Shizuka: Holla! :)
03so half the time you pay them and they just don't send anything
hey Shizuka hows your day been

on the seller profile
hurr
03there were none
03and
03his profile on the other trading site
killerpony7733: For reasons relating to the fact the enitre chat;s reactions were a mix of "WTF" and "Oh, GilDash" last time I posted my desktop, I don't think I should do so again. :$
03had like 40 comments saying he was a good seller
03so apparently he decided to become a scammer and joined Bitcoin Classifieds instead >_>
GilDash private chat?
GilDash: what killerpony7733 said, lol
i have to add pictures to my brony article do you guys think a picture of dusty would be a good idea
... Fine... :D
tomorrow... there will be Muffins...

GilDash: That teasing of yours never fail.:3
Om: Not for me it doesn't. l(
;)
bye MegaMoonShine
Sylandest|Writing: Just got off work and decided to mellow out to some bronystate.
User0: I just teased him with a room. :D
Iron_Edge: I just got back to work
Iron_Edge: well, have a cider and rest your hooves, you've earned it. *tosses you a fresh mug*
GilDash: Right. Well we weren't talking about you, were we?
User0: -lol- arent busy work days a blast.
Om: Aww, but I've been so patient. :(
Iron_Edge: Yeah, because I'm going to be gone after today (13th-22nd - not sure if I'll have internet...)
Sylandest|Writing: *yawns and eases back into a pile of hay taking a sip of cider in the process*
User0: Buissness related trip?
GilDash: Yes you have. Would you like a doggie biscut for your endeavors?
Om: ...
/me noms Om's ear.
how come User0
bbl
GilDash: Dat nomming, I wub noms.:3
GilDash: dog treats for the master teaser :D
Iron_Edge, alexxm: no, half vacation, half helping my bro move
MadSurge: I take my own treats. ;)
hope that goes well User0
GilDash: Oh you :D
alexxm: I'd rather be at work - I want money...
MadSurge: Who else? :)
GilDash: I would implore you not to eat my ears, or anything else for that matter.
User0 after thursday i might have a job myself
alexxm: very nice.
Om: They're much tastier then any musty dog biscuit...
User0: Ah, I hated it when I had to go overseas for about a month to Tokyo for training. I mean tokyo was fun and all but the hotel I was in just happened to be one of the only non Wifi oriented hotels. So I went a month without bronystate -lol- Doesnt seem like much I know but I missed all you knuckle heads <3
GilDash: Have you tried the biscuts? You might find them very appetizeing.
Iron_Edge: sucks, and glad you're still here
User0: -lol- so am I.
Om: I love your ears so much though...
wait go back to that last one
I can easily get wifi, I just don't know if I'll be able to have my laptop... (weight is a big issue)
The one with the lovely strings
GilDash: Its all an ilusion.
User0: Carry it in a backpack on board the plane with you.
Thank you kirzstryfe <3
Om: Illusion or no, they're damn tasty. :
:)
User0: Or if your going by car just keep it with you.
DRF should go back to primary school
Iron_Edge: Well, I'd rather use the weight of my laptop to transfer my brother's stuff, if need be...
He can't count to 5
:p

GilDash: You will get nothing an like it.

Iron_Edge: He has a lot of stuff - I'd sac my laptop to let him bring more of his stuff
1056789
User0: ohhhh..well like I said keep it in a small backpack and carry it with you. Thats what I did with my laptop.
Om: Ears it is then. <3
GilDash: No -_-
/me noms Om's ears.
Om: perhas you should check your ears to see why GilDash keeps nomming on them?
Iron_Edge: I'll freely sac the laptop if that lets him bring more stuff (whether it is magic cards or books or whatever)
my chat derped
Sylandest|Writing: They taste like coffee. :)
By every one
bye cow334
User0: -lol- well someone is aiming for the brother of the year award. -lol- but all in all regardless of how long your gone we'll be waiting for you to come back :)
cow334: See ya! :)
Sylandest|Writing: It says they taste good. I think its an exuse to eat them just to agrivate me/
cow334: later bro /)
Iron_Edge: after tonight, I might not be back until the 22nd
User0: Thats only 10 days.
User0: -lol-
GilDash: well, if they taste like coffee, does that mean Om dips his ears in coffee? :S
Om: it is a possibility :D
Sylandest|Writing: I dunno. Maybe Om just tastes like coffee...
Why would I do that
GilDash: that discovery is one I will leave to you to discover :$
Peanut butter?
ohhh this is a pallette for pony colors
Sylandest|Writing: I like cream with my coffee... ;)
Iron_Edge: I'm already going to be without my circuits boards, tools, violin, and other such toys (including the flowersticks I got on saturday from a yard sale)
Sylandest|Writing: -_- you. You arent helping.
User0: not the violin :(
User0: sigh....you've seriously got skill with that instrument bro.
Iron_Edge: Well, that is way too bulky... (and I've played it every night for the last 5 days)
/me monocle
GilDash: ehehe :$ meep
My word
Om: I'm just an innocent bystander here! :$
This picture...it enlightens me.
03so
03http://oi46.tinypic.com/1zlsq4p.jpg
Iron_Edge: I was teaching somepony who was trying to compose some music theory last night.
MORE CHAOS!
03>Facebook headquarters has arcade machines that play ROMs
14lool
Om: I do that alreadyu
14afk shower
User0: And then you can teach other ponys as well?? Dude you have a musical cutie mark! -lol-
Om: Can I have some cream with my coffee? ;)
it's like I'm really in the 80s again
GilDash: I don't even want you to have the coffee!
User0: Maybe some kind of plasma musical cutie mark...hmmm
Om: Please! :)
drf likes facebook now
GilDash: No.
Om: One day, Omffee...
Iron_Edge: But I'm a computer engineer, and a juggler, and a chainmail(ler?), and a builder, and possibly an artist... not just a musician...
10...
10I hate my dad
User0: Ah, but one of these skills is slightly stronger than the others!
probably engineer...
why D:
10He booked us for two days in Tennessee
User0: And thats your challenge. To find out which one it is ^-^
GilDash: And won't that be a fun day for you. Until then. No. And more No.
I know how to call a chicken! Scoota loooo scoot scoot scoot a loooo
10June 18 and 19
GilDash: I'll just leave you two to have your fun :$
kirzstryfe: You drawing?
10June 18, Pokémon Conquest will arrive from Amazon
Sylandest|Writing: >_>
10It will be delivered at my dad's work
Iron_Edge: but what happens if my engineering overlaps my music (once I make a distortion pedal)?
so whats the matter with that?
hey |Discord| hows your day been
just you'll miss the delivery while you're away?
10No one will pick it up (he works for himself)
Om: I am removing myself from the situation, as you wished. You did say I wasn't helping, after all :P
also WHEN IS THAT GAME GONNA GET A EU RELEASE ANNOUNCEMENT!!??!1
8,6yeah
ah
10left unattended
10>_>
Om: There's only so many times you can say no, Omffee. ;)
oh I see D:
User0: Depends is it your passion? Do you wake up everyday just waiting for the smell of the next tool or piece of tech you get to dig into?
well if it gets nicked he should reinburse you for it :\
03this is why
03get AceKard, download ROM, problem solved
alexxm: Great actually
what happened |Discord|
10he booked this behind our back too..
alexxm: And you?
10I don't want to go
User0: -lol- When i get to work nothing fills me more with energy than the smell of melting metal, blazing hot fires steaming the air and the crisp pungent aroma of burnt leather. ^-^
10We've been to Tennesse every other summer, same hotel, same area
ah
User0: I know it sounds weird but its what I love to do ^-^
GilDash: I cant spam it. Sometimes i'll mix it up and say Hello no.
10Same everything
i'm good |Discord| got a trial shift at a cafe i gave my cv to
10For me, it's a HUGE waste of time
Iron_Edge: that makes perfect sense.
10But my mother won't let me stay home alone for two days, so
Om: No spam from my end. Just all my love, and then some. ;)
alexxm: sOUNDS GREAT
alexxm: Caps lock sry
User0: -lol- I can smell your sarcasm :|
GilDash: Oi...
yep |Discord| if it goes well i'll have a job
Om: Ozzy, Ozzy, Ozzy!
No way.....the song...:)
GilDash: Yes?
/me ponies Nittany_Discord
GilDash: xD
GilDash hehehe ozzy :D
03so in other words, you're complaining that you get to go on vacation instead of playing Pokémon the very day it's released? :P
Iron_Edge: No, really, that smell has been linked with what you like to do
alexxm: thats awesome :) I myself will be going to a job interview to a tannery.
actually I would complain too *runs
alexxm: good luck
hope that goes well Alchemist
No one did, Oi, Oi, Oi. No one?! >_<
/me 11,01puts ponies on Gunthler
thanks User0
Yay ponies :P
10No. I'm not comfortable with a package just sitting next to a door for a couple days. Tons of other people walk through there
including the darkrai event from years pack
GilDash: Remember, you get none.
10>going to the same place every year
Nittany_Discord: Everyone has a pony on their head.>_<
03you can just complain to Amazon if it gets stolen LOL
10or every other
Nittany_Discord: Do I get ponies? No. ok...
03and they'll give you another
10Sure
well if you're getting it from amazon there's a good chance it'll come a day early
clarification: tannery=/= a place where people go to get a tan. tannery as in leather tannery.
User0: -lol- well yeah. I mean not everypony will realize there talent by smell. But for me its like how GIlDash enjoys Om's ears. You cant explain it really, but there's something there that makes it worth moving to go and do -lol-
ordered games through the post usually sometimes do
10Nick, how many days early?
10Because the day before is a Sunday
User0: My talent fuels me in other words. :)
10Post offices aren't open on Sundays
Iron_Edge: Does everyone support that thing -_-
Om: The ear thing?
Om: Yes. I'm lovable, see? ;)
Om: well, if your ears taste like coffee, apparently, we do
/me 11,01hugs |Discord|
ah :\
Let me see if I can find a picture that equals my dissatisfaction.
Nittany_Discord: :) thank you my dear friend.
but yeah it sometimes happens my uncle got Battlefield 3 two days before store release
Om: Good luck with that. :D
GilDash: we may have prodded him a wee bit too far :$
Om: Shes weird, but ya' gotta admit she is just a silly filly. And the more you reject her ear nom's the more shell latch to you im guessing. IDK.
Sylandest|Writing: Pssh! Not far enough I say. :D
/me hugs |Discord|
Iron_Edge: You don't know me very well, do you? ;)
Om how can't GilDash be loveable?
GilDash: there's never an end in sight for you, hehehe :$
10Maybe I'll get lucky and it will arrive on Saturday
Iron_Edge: I can see that.
Sylandest|Writing: There is. It involves a kick. :D
GilDash: Are you doing your antics again?:D
What if Valve made a game that combined Left 4 Dead and Team Fortress 2 and just named it "3".
GilDash: -lol- :D Im just a blacksmith kid. I dont know anything about ear nomming -lol-
GilDash: ooh...good point :$
killerpony7733: Oh let me count the ways.
yeah!
11,01I'm currently streaming Retsuparae at Bronyfunds. I'll be playing a game when I'm done with some job hunting.
10but gosh this boils my blood
it can happen honestly
10My dad can't be patient and wait for the big vacation trip we plan in August..
Nittany_Discord: Good luck with the hunt. I know what that crap's like. :(
Nittany_Discord: Are you an good with metal?
Iron_Edge: well, there are a bunch of smells that invigorate me, including dust (taking apart old things), hot metal (building/disassembly/solder), cutting wood... apparently ozone from my plasma speaker ('-.-), what else...
Nittany_Discord: There always looking for blacksmiths. The work is ropugh but the pay is good.
If anyone is from the UK, can you tell me what are the chances for a eastern european guy with a masters degree to find a job over there?
03and here you were complaining about being stuck in Ohio but now you're complaining about going on vacation? LOL
where you going for that?
10Florida, prolly
11,01Iron_Edge: I'm looking for teaching or research.
Iron_Edge: Violin rosin has a pretty distinct smell...
Alchemist i don't know this the closest i've come to getting a job and i'm 18
if I was booked a vacation to I dunno...Greenland I wouldn't be happy about it :\
10Destin, FL, we always go there too but I don't mind as much because yaysunning
User0: -lol- well maybe there is something that links all of those things. As far as I know i think there are specific types of engineering that take those into factoring.
I love Florida
I was like a kid reborn when I went there six years ago
10I was complaining about being stuck in Ohio for the summer?
10I don't think I did.
11,01Even if I were to look for metalsmithing, I would probably not have any better luck getting a job in that field as I do now with the places I'm applying.
03you do at random times
03when your parents piss you off
Iron_Edge: computer engineering - the smell of old coffee, and the smell of stale cheetos dust from the keyboard
10For the summer, no
10but yeah
10I want to move out
Alchemist: You've got as much chance as someone native to the UK. That is to say, not good.
alexxm: from what I gathered I see that most british people frown upon foregin labour, especially people from poland/east europe....
Alchemist usually becuase foriegn labour is not only cheaper its better
GilDash:I think its still much better than in Hungary.
british people have no work ethic
Alchemist: Not *all* of us do. :)
Chrysalis: Oi! I do! :|
Alchemist i'm not like that
13http://puu.sh/Aufx <-- found this gem in my old library
I cant find one
GilDash, alexxm: thats why I said MOST and not ALL :)
Chrysalis: I'm the perfect example, I'm at work and I'm in bronystate...
Chrysalis foreign labor is hardly the answer :'(
03>making Windows look like OSX
03oh god why.jpg
LOL
13laik a baws
User0 where do you work?
03not really
I write code.
yarly.jpg
User0 explain that like how does it work with how you have it as a job
like a toss
I'm studying computer engineering and I try to get code to do what I'm told that it should do...
next up- Having the entire screen be just one *huge* taskbar
a toss
which I do not give
User0 ah i see

Suddenly everyone wen't quiet 6_9
killerpony7733: More or less, I sit in front of a computer and just throw code at my screen and hope it works...
https liunk plz
:s
some days are better than others...
I should've went for IT instead of chemistry. both my roommates are in that field, one has a bachelors, the other is doing his master's and they both are bombarded with job offers...
Ohthere
Okay
03http://i.imgur.com/RzfWM.jpg
03ohai
03also I need to leave soon LOL
10Still using that wallpaper
Alchemist: Comp Enge, and Comp Sci tend to be needed... but it does take a lot of patients and problem solving...
03why not?
03it's only the best wallpaper ever
10Just pointing it out
03no intention of changing it
Jackle App right?
I still don't understand the reason behind your fixation on me GilDash.
10Spaaace
03I don't see the point of changing wallpapers every few days
03considering I hardly minimize all my stuff anyway
patience* (obviously english isn't that important)
03generally I'll have Firefox or equivalent fullscreened on left monitor and IRC on the right :P
13am i the only one that doesnt like Win7 gadgets?
Om: I don't understand why you bring me up every now and again, Om...
User0: I know because I usually hear when my roommates get fed up with a 3000 line code and cant find the problem :D
03yes.
02Nope
http://i.imgur.com/CIr19.png
03it's better than a giant OSX looking launcher
GilDash: Would you preffer I not then?
03pin to taskbar, problem solved
02Hence why you can dissable
03especally when your taskbar is like 3x the normal size :P
Alchemist: the code base for where I work is magnitudes larger than that...
Om: I didn't say that. ;)
Alchemist: the one file I'm working on right now is 5545 lines long
13i dunno, dun care
User0: I guessed so, but consider that they both study so they are not yet working on "real" projects.
13i liek it this way :3
>.>
13stylish and different
13like a one of a kind
Alchemist: This is only a summer internship...
03not realy
03you're just ripping off another OS LOL
13wait
Oh wow, who is streaming ^^
03it's like that stupid new GUI for Ubuntu

Iron_Edge: (\ how are you man?
Om: it is kinda Gil's specialty, lol :D

Om: There's no misleading. ;)

Panda: almost kinda goodish afternoon

03"At the Wendy's in Atlanta. It's the coke fountain soda machine."
Panda: Meh...ya' know the reg. -lol-
03that is a LOT of choices
GilDash: How do I know that.
8,6and that's it for me, Shizuka's up next with whatever shenanigans she has planned today
Panda: No problem.
Iron_Edge: haha i know what you mean ^^
I really should go work on my PS3...
Thanks kirzstryfe.
thx, kirzstryfe :)
butbutbut Assassin's Creed
but then again I dont know any details of what they do, Im quite computer illiterate...
thanks for the stream kirstryfe
Om: Take a leap of faith with me and you'd see. ;)
kirzstryfe: thanks kirz <3
Panda: oi, what am I, chopped liver? :P XD
Sylandest|Writing: sorry i didnt see your ping ^^
kirzstryfe: That was a good 30 seconds I managed to catch!
Panda: Oh, what did Om and you get up to? ;)
GilDash: you are loosing your touch xD
GilDash: A leap of faith would require I have something to belive in. And hope for.
Panda: hehehe, only kidding :D
GilDash: nvm, i thought you would never notice XD
Om: I'll catch you. ;)
http://lh5.ggpht.com/_1QSDkzYY2vc/TJfPmWegM3I/AAAAAAAAB9E/CGHR9AF5e04/macbuntu.png < Ubuntu says Hi OSX
Panda: Please, I was waiting on you. ;)
Alchemist: I was a student tech assistant senior year at my high school (within the top 7 of my high school of 2000+)
Is VioletVanila awake now?
Om: I thought it was that you were supposed to not fear death...-lol-
13Refresh your streams please~
GilDash: Right. Cuse that is what I want.
GilDash: :D
/me refreshed
If you gave a mac user Ubuntu, they wouldn't be able to tell the difference because there is little difference :D
Oh dear doom 3 :O
Iron_Edge: There is a difference in not fearing death, and seeking it out.
03XD
03see, so much for originality
Om: You'll never know if you don't try. ;)
02Well
02F my life
aww :(
03at least Windows XP made a somewhat unique GUI
What a awesome game minus its extreme jump scare
Om: Oh, I was going with the assassins creed version -lol-
03as did Vista/7 with the Aero themes
this should be good
02Brb, getting jap 3ds
13theming =/= originality?
02I had enough unlocalized games
03if you use theming to rip someone else off, sure
/me is listening to Megadeth's Trust in Spanish... not bad...

Iron_Edge: Always good.
02Nothing to do here. brb, finding prices and whatnot
GilDash: so still trying with Om huh?
THAT'S FUCKING DOOM3, I KNEW IT! :D
13i dun rip off, only the taskbars
GilDash: And if I have no need to know. Why would I try eh?
GilDash you don't say?
13then using someone else's wallpaper would be rippin off too :P
11,01Sucks that I never finished this game on stream.
03except that those images are actually made to be wallpapers
GilDash: it did kinda say Doom3...
Om: That's a poor excuse, Omffee. ;)
03I had to pay to get a membership at Digital Blasphemy XD
13so, these bars too
03which is fine, that guy's awesome
User0: I mean, just from the loading screen I got it.
13goolgeplz
13xD
03well
03yeah
Nitanny_Discord it's a great game despite extreme use of jump scares
03ripping off people is one thing
Panda: I try with *everypony*. ;)
03but don't mention stealing art on TST
03you'll burn in hell for it
03:P
03(though if you want any Digital Blasphemy stuff I can loan you my account *cough cough*)
GilDash: You don't have verry good reasons, so I don't need very solid excuses.
GilDash that you do :D
GilDash: as long as you dony go on my territory im fine *growls*
13i dun need that
Doom 3?
13google is enough
Om: Fun. That's enough for anypony. :)
CrimsonPhoenix: Aye.
oh hey it is
13and i used a special program made for changing that theme and such
GilDash: that was a joke btw XD
hey CrimsonPhoenix hows your day been
Panda: Please, I'd be tempted anyway. ;)
what is this?
GilDash: dont know if should continue trying to write or stop to hang and watch stream. suggestions? :D
13i has now: Custom bootlogo, Custom OS, Custum Startorb, full custom OSX Dock, and nice colours :3
GilDash: hehe
Slept horribly, my new mouse arrived, looking up some houses.
GilDash: Only. Fun. -__-
Sylandest|Writing: I love Doom3 and I never write. What am I going to suggest. :D
03LOL custom OS
Sylandest|Writing: watch what GilDash and Om will do next ^^
03yay sugar coating?
Sylandest what you writing on?
Doom 3?
Panda: I like your idea, lol :D
03"I resized my icons, look at how much of a mad hacker I am!"
/me hides
Om: Yeah. That thing you don't know how to do. ;)
Sylandest|Writing: hehe its like they are a couple... without being a couple ;) twice the drama xD
Shizuka: -lol-
I havent ever played doom 3.
03says the one who hates Android
Panda: haha! :D
13and if you changed an OS sooo much, that even the cde is changed, i call it custom,
this won't end well
13and i dont hate android
GilDash: I know how to have fun. Just. Not with other poeple. Often.
13never said it
03what do you mean by "code is changed"?
03Kindly explain how you did anything to Windows to actuall ymake it custom :P
Om: :( but you had fun with me... no? :(
03Changing stuff that Microsoft allows you to change doesn't count
03as that's the whole point of customization
03which is WHY Windows 7 is an awesome OS
13*coughREGISTRYcough*
Om: I'm as gentle as the come, Om. :)
03like what? :P
Nittany_Discord you are streaming correct?
spoiler: people will die
11,01No. Shizuka is streaming.
Panda: ... You and Om...? :O
03also you keep saying how much you love iOS and that you prefer it over Android :P
Panda: I enjoyed talking with you. I give fun a different meaning.
13buuut allowing counts too, it doesnt function like win7 anymore
13so?
13preferring =/= hating
GilDash: hehe ;) jelly? xD jkjk
Panda: You've no idea... :(
Shizuka you going to play ROE sometime after finishing DOOM 3?
Om: i know, thats what I meant. and well... she should have fun next time xD

Oh Hai wrek
Er.. I mean left then right

/me noms GilDash
Lil_B: yu think u ain't a brony?
I still don't know fully what"dusts" means... does it mean that I get covered in dust?
Om: I don't view crows as macabre, for the record. And to me Doom 3 is just a very good game, nothing more.
GilDash: Yes, but your intrests are starting so seem rather dark :)
did i derped?
Lil_B: It means you get dusted.
Demon: "Surprise!!" Doom Marine: *shotgun*
Lil_B: No it kinda means the opposite
Om: I like crows. :( They're intelligent and all. :(
http://derpy.me/Bkd7X
13oblivious, party of two
lol i derped
Lil_B: y u think u ain't a brony?
GilDash: Why so sad about that xD
crows are spirits of vengenace to me
MadSurge: :D
<3
13mm
13that can't be good..
13he really needs to clean out his office
SAEV MEEEE
that can't be good
Yeah.
Shizuka: -.-"
Om: Because everyone always miscontrues it. :(
That thing is alive!
Shizuka: Heh, he's got nothing on me. :D
just gigantic guts hanging from the walls. nothing special :)
somehow i'm thinking deadspce was scarier... and you even got used to that real quick
Magical_pablez94 for me a brony is someone who is way more into MLP than me... I just watch it sometimes (the last time was i think a month ago) and I'm in this stream here daily (that and I like good Artwork and Music by the community
why is it becoming more organic
05gna lie downm, bb all<3
bye Wrek
Wrek: have fun
Good luck Wrek ^^'
GilDash: I'm gussing you don't know what macabre means then xD

Shizuka Tex.
Stop trying to kill me of cuteness CCCP!
the guy who designed the primer on that grenade deserves buckshot to the face
how come Dark_Horst
Lil_B: i don't watch ponies daily... but i'm a brony anyway and i'm here almost everyday and love ponymusic and ponyart and above all PONY TUMBLRS *drolls*
I just had an awesome Idea... how about Doom2, with Ponys? ... no, bad idea, unless you change the shooting into something else XD
MegaMoonShine: :3
Some one get the Mars Sysadmin to fix that network error!!
alexxm: took way too long to go boom
I just realised that I've been listening to smooth jazz the entire day.
13it's so smooth
13you can't take it?
GilDash: I understand that. I was just epistemic about crows and theri common veiw, and you know alot about Doom. Just making a light connection. I wasn't trying to insult you :(
/me slides Kammerjunk across the floor.
13the club cannot even handle you?
I'm slidin' out of this chair.
Kammerjunk: hai
Oh hi
Lil_B: after dat ddom2 thing about ponies... u definetly are a brony. :D
Kammerjunk: are you slipping out of your chair?
I like portals
13pick up the pace... then pick it up more
/me 11,01slides along the floor
13and MORE
hey Kammerjunk hows your day been
Slow.
i went through the entire balloon party album today. after that my brain felt partially raped and it enjoyed it
Om: I know. It still winds me up when people make the assumption that I like crows so I must be macarbre. They are really amazing birds.
http://derpy.me/DBdI1
it's a LONG album
/me trips of Nittany_Discord "dafuq?"
over*
/me uses Nittany_Discord as a surfboard.
CCCP: :why:
Magical_pablez94: I think a significant difference is buying mlp merchandise. While many people do, I dont and never will. But the term "brony" still has no official definition.
Magical_pablez94 me too, I think the other reason i don't want to call myself that is, I don't really like the word itself, and that thing with the Doom 2 Ponys was more like a joke... (which i wouldn't mind to see in reality :D )
CCCP: :'(
Kammerjunk: sorry :3
GilDash thats why i ask about it instead making a really stupid assumption :)
Wrek!
Pawnch!
MadSurge: i know i know :(

HOW DARE YOU PUNCH ME *shotgunn'd*
GilDash: Alright. I appologize.

Lil_B: change ur sex and use "pegasister" :D:D:D

In Doom 3, Doomguy appears similar to his classic Doom incarnation, with the exception that his facial features are not concealed
11,01I never found those.

alexxm Dunno.
Nittany_Discord: A mod I'd assume.
Suddelny redness!
Holy shit tripin balls
11,01I think Shizuka is cheating anyway. Always at 100 health.
Nittany_Discord: I know a fair amount of this game and there are no light amplification goggles in there.
Nittany_Discord you mean the night vision? I think it is a mod.
MadSurge: where was that first coined? I only remember it from Max Payne 2...

In 2009, GameDaily included him on the list of "ten game heroes who fail at the simple stuff" for his unability to look up and down in the original series
Why does everyone do that :(

Bah i'm tired :( but its only 10pm

Sumica is actually a decent shot. I watched an LP of this game made by theNecroscope and he wasnt that good.
sorry shizuka, wasnt sure, but you could get the bfg a little bit ago :(
Wait wuut?
Panda: google images and other pony related sites :)
02If she where here I'd ask her a lot of stuff about importing

02I'm starting to have an urge to import
Om: It's a shame you won't let me teach you what I want you to learn. ;)
what questions are these
11,01Did something explody come and kill Shizuka?
GilDash: Cant always get what you want.
11,01That wasn't me.
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m473f23Aho1rriakmo1_500.jpg LOL

02Voltage and electricity stuff

hey all
pyrocatboy: lol indeed :D
02Well, she has imported some games, right?
Hi Alicorn_Prince_Shane

Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Sup bro /)
I'd actually like to see female dragons. Just to understand more of the dragons' society :D
11,01I would never go into the game except to give her a hug. She would probably still shoot me by mistake, though.
CCCP: im gonna pront that out and post it at my school :D
GilDash: And how has that worked so far?
I mean yeah you can wait for her I guess
Omnomnom
but seeing as she dissappears for months at a time
Nittany_Discord: :( my thoughts exactly
Nittany_Discord: by..."mistake" you say? like in the beginning with all the humans?

Om: Yes...?
Ponies47: :D
Phase4 dead :'(
;_;
/me runsrunsruns
00,02alexxm, i have stuff to do today
PONIESPONIESPONIESPONIESPONIES
Awww
I eat your Care Bears I EAT EM ALL
just for you, nick :D
ok Phase4
Party pooper
you fiend
6you become a graduate only to become a freshman
GilDash: I dunno. Doesn't matter.
Nittany_Discord: stream some KSP :$
Can someone get me a GIF. for this?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3RzMCRu_6o&feature=related
eh?
11,01Come to the bronyfunds stream and I will.
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3qh2dwuBP1rshxsuo1_500.png
what is a freshman or what does one do? I obviously hear it a lot in movies
Ponies47: Were u a fruit?
indeed
but still
2I could never remember all of those name-thingies
it's hard to say goodbye to so many people you've formed strong bonds with
2Or what order they go in
Om: Come on. You can tell me. :)
Ponies47: u snapped didnt u?
/me devolved Staraptor to Staravia :3
6freshman > sophomore > junior > senior
/me hugs Ponies47
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3pywbMDbH1rvbl6qo1_500.jpg
6nick, a freshman is essentially the lowest level in high school and college levels (both schools use the same names)
hugs alexxm back
Ponies47:if u did, Why?
nick, what aurora means is that I am going from a senior from high school to a freshman in college
ah thanks
yeah
6it's also used as an insult, as freshman are rather stupid
6most of the time
6like
GilDash: I still don't like it.
6REALLY STUPID
6because they haven't broken into life at the school
so like a rl insult of noobs?
/me runs
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m30q4oCE8c1r0zabpo1_500.png
6pretty much
Om: Give it time. :)
xD
heh well that was me at uni this year, it was a Lot different from college
Ponies47: i am now a fruit :$
6when you're a high school freshman, you're still young and stupid cuz middle school is where they cram all of the young 6th graders with the older but not mature 8th graders
6so HS freshman tend to be really immature
I don't know about "stupid" as much as "unknowledgeable," although there are those freshmen that think they are all that
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3jsswHTGz1r3gomwo1_500.jpg
both in high school and college
6by the time they're seniors, they're top of the school food chain and are very self centered, which is AWFUL to be when you enter college freshman status
GilDash: Fine.
2Staravia what :O /late
6nah
Come on everypony become a fruit for Ponies47 :$!
/me hugs Om.
6most freshman I meer are plain stupid
6as in
6they lack a lot
6in common sense
6A LOT.
lol wow
6of course, I'm giving nick the definition of why freshman is used so much in movies
2I imagine it's quite a change
YAY!
IF YA'LL BECOME FRUIT I WILL SNAP AND IT WILL NOT BE PRETTY!
/me is a mineral
6I don't have that much against people who just go into school....that's stupid ll

2Hallo
hi chimew
hey guys
/me makes staraptor's eyes bulge out cartoonishly

lol staravia/staraptor was the reason i watched the D/P anime it was so funny
2O_O
hey Arteza147 hows yoru day been
hey Arteza147
alexxm: Our school holds a discovery camp for preschool children for two weeks during the Summer. I signed up as a helper.
Hello Arteza147
2I watched the one where he evolved lol
how did that go
but lol CITV was advertising 'new' episodes of pokemon...it's still the D/P/P saga
fgs MOVE ON ALREADy Dx
alexxm: WWell considering the fact that i had half of my foot burned off in surgery...... Alright
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzga7aQtX01r13bigo1_500.jpg
and yeah I saw it on yt
2It's kinda sad how most places are just so meh about the show
yeah...
2I want to watch the other Staraptor eps at some point, but eh
Arteza147 sorry to hear about your foot
02what show?
alexxm: Dont be. It was my own damn fault......
I got another call from some political survey group earlier - wasn't in the best of moods at the time either - I kinda snapped at the person who called me when I heard the words political survey - :S gave the poor caller a short cuss out before hanging up the phone...
alexxm: Today was not bad. Pretty exhausting though...
TF2 - Engineer Song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHu1RASUUPY
the UK though really moves on quick with popculture things, Pokemon I remember by the third gen was nonexistant in the UK in terms of anime and merchandise now it went downhill really quick
pyrocatboy the last film i saw was hot shots part deux is that bad
but the thing about the UK is do something they like and they'll love it for eternity
what happened Arteza147
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzga7aQtX01r13bigo1_500.jpg I dunno.
Last movie I saw was Ninja >.>

So how much do you want to bet that the comments will blow upat the line: "Game over man"
6it depends on why you're getting drunk, in my opinion
6if you're doing it to have a good time, then fine
alexxm: yeah.
2Drinking doesn't always equal drunk though
6drunk personalities take on and amplify the emotions you have at the time of drinking
what did you say my chat derped
AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
in terms of drinking, I drink sociably in quiet places close to home like pubs
6so if you happened to be angry and need a drink, you're just going to ruin everyone
NOOOOOO
YES!
I HEAR STREAM
no
Im way past clubbing now :\ hatte it

2I've never actually been clubbing and hope I never actually do it
dat SB theme
lalalalalala
stand for the song of our people
loud annoying music, £5 entry, £4 for a crap pint of lager, 70% chance of being started on for a fight, forced to stay out till 3am
00,10not like I went out of my way to hide
sod that
This was the first thing I saw when I entered BronyState for the first time! :D

What is this amazing sound I'm hearing~
Whats this song? I forgot D:
yeah I just dont see the point, what's the point in clubbing if youre going out with friends, and you cant even hear them shouting at the top of their voices in your ear because of lady gaga blaring on the speakesrs
i was wondrring why my sound wasn't working
/me 11,01pony

Judge_Holden: i love getting a bunch of cub scouts and dress them up as pigs and making them fight to the death :3
alexxm (Insert Spongebob reference)
Why does she have aviator sunglasses in space?
Sumica: I built it in a cave, with a box of scraps.
warning, you must be Samus Aran level to tackle this mission
Because they look cool.
12(<---
Losttimes: In spaaaaaaaaaace
Sumica: Neat.
You know that some fat guy behind a desk has directed the movie when the marines act like 5-year olds
11,01What are you doing playing in pipes Sumica?
In the pipe, five by five.
Darf14: lol
The real question is,why not?
12LOLOL thats amoosing
Samus would fuck their shit up
CCCP: aye, that was the funnest part of being a cub scout

alien vs predator vs space pirates vs samus
Fly the friendly.
Losttimes: Because it looks cool, no other reason needed
I mean, when she's done with a place, there's a 99.95 % chance that the place she went to will blow up
might as well just stats boost while we're at it hurr durr

Polydunami: Too obvious
State of the badass art.

See what we can see. Most orginal line ever.

My douche bag meter is going off the chart~
First to die. Almost assured.
Dead jackass walking.
alexxm So i've heard...........i've been dissapointed after ADR got injured (again??) But i guess Ziggler is also a good choice......rushed, but Show-stealing-potential for sure. (What if he defends the title until WM against Zack Ryder)
Most badass 5-year old right there
00,10this was all cut too iirc

We got balls
I just heard Twilight
Somehow
Judge_Holden: Agreed
WE GOT BIG BALLS
Sumica, it was, sadly, I don't remember any of this :(
FUN FACT: The infamous "Game over, man! Game over!" Scene was improvised on the spot
We got sonic electronic ballbreakers.
til now of course
Twilight will SAVE THEM!!!!
02!Shipping
02:3
WE GOT TWILIGHT SPARKLE
Matrix stole game over man from this right?
Dark92Enigma how many times is it now del rios been injured

Calcos323: I belive it. That sort of whining can't be practiced. It must come natural
SirGanjalf: I love that song
Calcos323: Just like "Luke, I am your father?"

I was thinking that, Colt_of_Personalty.
Colt_of_Personalty: Aliens AINEC
changlings
Dark92Enigma: you like krabby patties dont you?
Love to see an alien version of the song.
i can see why poeple like this movie so much. these are some tasty effects for the time it came out
StinkomanFan: Dear Celestia I hope so
Wow..... I just realised that the Movie 300 is 5 years old now.... dear god time flies
We call that, Beam Me Up, Scotty, ROHKARA :3
yea
Changelings could outwit them
xenomorphs Colt_of_Personality they've oreaty much been bread to be a weapon
!eonget
YES cachi01! I LOVE KRABBY PATTIES!
What will the start time be for the Indiana Jones trilogy in GMT?
Or, Elementary, My Dear Watson
How leafing.
I'm trying to imagine the TF2 Guys in this scenario
lol
WE GOT THE NOSTALGIA CRITIC
Judge_Holden: Eeyup
GET TO THE POINT, MAGGOT!
Hudson, run a bypass and then extract the gall bladder.
00,10this makes me want to play alian swarm

StinkomanFan: We've got HEAVY WEAPONS GUY!
HW guy?Give him enough medics and it's a no problem situation
02D:
ooo Alien Swarm
alexxm, worse :D
Heavy goes in first
and dumb qustion
WE GOT----(Insert GET ON WITH IT clip)
Sumica: Power fist + Energized Armour no other weapons
Strange how there seemed to be like 20 before and now there are 5
Hacking of the future looks pretty easy. :P
/me takes the Leafeon just in case
Entire alien team is babies!
02:<
Hm.. midnight huh. Guess I'll be napping during the day then ^_^ heh
06!eonget
（￣へ￣）
but why do the heavy gunners have the dumbest headwear
xenobabies,for accuracy
06zap
It costs 400 000$ to fire from this pulse rifle, for 12 seconds
IT cost 600000 to fire this weapon.....
how come StinkomanFan
Heavy weapons girl if credit to team~
How shocking.
is*
The first one will be shown on Monday right?
boooo
IT costs 900000000000000000000000 Bisondollars to fire the weapon
020,8is this shocking?
She really needs a Medic to keep her healthy
/me hides
00,10the head gear is to interdace with weapons sencors suposedly
MY I''S
Dark92Enigma: whts a bison dollar?
03you violating the color rules? not shocking at all;
/me hideds
03-d
Dark92Enigma: SPACE dollars that is
Send only one team of marines to fight the first ever recorded hostile alien threat. Seems Legit:[
ponibas|AFK 5 british pounds
ponibas|AFK: Mann store promotion?
lol
Bison Dollar is best currency
lol video tapping
In moderation it's fine
Not constant use
00,10Dashite, chain saw, flame thrower and charged armor.
I can't want for Colonial Marines. <3
Calcos323: Yes, YES!
Distortion: They didn't know it was aliens
I see your space dollars, Losttimes and raise you double dollars
This movie needs more Jonesy
it's not a combat mission, Distortion. recon and rescue
the beep of "oh crap,this is going to hell"
Crystal meth for whales
Distortion: they dont know if it is an alien
When I first watched this movie I thought that the motion tracker sounds were my speakers breaking~
02true :[D
Sumica: I was banned from using the flamethrower. :/
ponibas|AFK It's a Street Fighter (movie) reference. That's the money M. Bison has as his capitol
03why should making people go blind be acceptable at all?
Distortion: They weren't aware of what the aliens were like at the time. No point devoting heavy resources to something that's potentially easy to deal with, from a buisness point of view.
03but whatever, I won't argue
They said it was aliens on the shp.
Dashite: The day Bison graced your village, was the most important day of your life. But for me, it was Tuesday
/me has sensitive eyes, so sue me
Motion Trackers are worst HUD
alexxm, They've got a drunk, an idiot, a mute, a kid who won't shut up, somepony who fakes there own death, a guy who's gun SHOOTS MEDICINE, and a loony who shoots rockets at himself
If anyone here hasn't played the OLD AvP games they should. They are great.
holy crap.. I have seen that in years
Polydunami: I'll mathc your double dollars with my CREDITS!
inb4 sosumi
haven't*
6because it's happened a lot in here, and not just him?
match*
It's not a combat mission...........IT'S A SUICIDE MISSION!
Distortin: It was unconfirmed
nothing like forgetting eitire parts of words
It's just fair that they'll die
6just gonna point that one out
03no, I'm saying why should it be acceptable for people to use the banned colors?
Right, we'll call it a draw.
blip blip blip blip
02anyone who can't take it can just type /clear
11,01'dat scanner sound.
03they're banned for a reason
FairysHuff: Loved playing Predators in those games <3
03um
03BlueFlare
03I have 9000 lines of scrollback
Sounds like imminent death.
Dat Nittany_Discord
03I'm not going to get rid of those because you're being a moron
The only compitent person would be the Engi, and he'd be outclassed SO HARD
00,10Dashite, I am alowed to use it cause I bring up the rear with it.
Captain, we've lost the blips, the bleep sand the creeps
11,01Dat PrincessLuna!
HERE WE GO!
StinkomanFan whos the idoit and who faked they're death
ahh, the sound of incoming death scene
time for some false shock
dat dat
02derp
Or its just newt...
Vegeta is not impressed.
6he's not the only one who's done it
DON'T DO LIKE THAT DUDE
if you concentrate on hit,you can hear the sound is actually "oh shit oh shit"
@Shimmer Yes, shame the new version, from vapcom I think? was so bad.
6so don't take it out on him
03did I say he was?
DAT DAT DAT DAT DAT
I love that detector
I've done it
Sumica: That's why I'm not allowed to use it. :p
00,10take that gerbals
the station cat
rats
LOL
Xenomorhps aint got shit on Necromorphs
11,01Reminds me of when I played AVP2.
these really do seem like the right guns for close quarters
Dang Gerbals!
Goddamn gerbil.
Rodents
kill the hamsters!
THE HAMSTER IS THE ALIEN
SO?
NOPE! Chuck Testa!
need xenogerbils NOW
Oh god a giant gerbal~
I think it's acceptable as a joke
03I'm saying, those colors are banned for a reason, so why should people be allowed to use them?
hamsters are best aliens
KILL IT
Okay, my ping should work now.
alexxm, the idiot is the Heavy and the guy who fakes his own death is the Spy
6a joke
Nittany_Discord: Me too
6like
03I was just telling him as he's the one who did it.
See, told you about gerbil feeders!
...................RODENTS!
Don't leave the gerbil.
6that was
thanks StinkomanFan
Shepard: So that's were my hampster went~
errr how da fuq did the hamsters survive!?
03I generally complain when *anybody* does it...
03because it hurts my eyes >_>
Gerbil is probably starving
hamter blow it up
/me noms Nittany_Discord
But not constant use like using that text colour script you use
/me glomps Shimmer :3
Acid for blood. Goddamnit aliens.
Judge_Holden: Too small to be fecehugged?
/me goes off to make sure Alien Swarm is installed
HARVEY, HARVEY, HARVEY THE WONDER HAMSTER!
Xenomorphs are op
It was the hampster
Ew.
dis reminds me of alien swarm
YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE THIS------
/me 11,01explodes
g2g guys i will be back in an hour.... damn i will miss aliens :(
LOL
SirGanjalf: no, how dey not starve to death? unless the survivors made feeding gerbils a top priority
00,10Secured my ass
Ta ta cachi01~
Fun Fact: You can actually simulate that acid look with Acetone and Styrofoam
"secured"
Nitt went explode when "love this" XD
who does everything the aliens take over become more organic
sure guy with no combat experience AGAINST HUMANS
in moderation, stuff like that is fine
Once again, bad leadership is going to destroy them all
the arie is surely ALIEN proof
bye!
11,01Everyone loves me explosions.
It's not like he uses it every line
Knows Alien is there, dosen't find Alien, Area Secured.
In this case meaning "Mostly unexplored and potentially hazardous"
This place is about as secure as a Kleenex.
Nittany_Discord: eeyup
A WET KLEENEX.
03but it still burns people's eyes just once :|
inb4 everything in moderation, including moderation
YOu should get an Desktop that explodes, Nitt :P
Judge_Holden, the alien didn't go for Jonesy
11,01*my
There are just giant holes in all the walls and floors. Its completly safe. :P
Judge_Holden: Aliens attacked not so long ago/huge ass gerbil feeders
/me cries
i have to reinstall
That leadership is going to hose them over
I wonder how the game Dead Space would be if Marines were on the ship?
00,10C.P.U
hurr jun

C.L.U.
I HATED CPU
02I do moderation in moderation which I also do in moderation.
drf you can ignore it
/me steals Nittany_Discord's duster and runs away
/me hugs ponibas whats the matter
I'm pretty sure a face hugger is big enough to eat a gerbal
ponibas: that's what you get for not having everything installed all the time.
FUCKING TEAM KILLING PEICE OF SHIT
I have to reinstall Alien swarm
*explodes*
no biggie
yes...just...this was a bad idea
it's not like you have to look at it 24/7
I'm pretty sure facehuggers lack the organs to eat anything.
00,10MCP is best CPU
11,01Come back here Shimmer.
I just thought of something awesome.... AVP LARPING ^_^
I do have to watch my HD space
Why are they going alone...?
MCP!
Didn't marines later have scouters as part of their uniforms?
SCP?
02Actually, it’s already/almost gone XD
lol, I like the Tron HISHE
The G-Force will avenge you!
ROHKARA: Facehugger don't eat. They just "copulate" with your face:|
Gerbils have been breeding, eating their mates, breeding, eating their mates, etc etc
Screen size, depends
Power is still up, what happened to all the lights?
I prefer the SPC
02yep
You get a face-full of alien dick
SHARK
PUNCHING
CLUB
02and text size
StinkomanFan: Student Price Card
Dun dun dun dun dudududuuuuuuuuuun
Secure
Contain
Protect
Here comes newt!
I love that it's apparently the scene of a big fight but there's no blood or bodies or anything. It's damn creepy.
02but if your text was that small, it wouldn't hurt
Did you see Deep Blue Sea? A goddamned shark ate me!
03orly
always go alone!
the big gun sure will come handy in those small spaces
... but gerbils are so cute. How could they be so sadistic? :'(
ponibas, I loved that movie!
jk
11,01Simple Poo Creator?
Meanwhile: the aliens were hungry
See, this is why you have a sidearm, dipshits
Nittany_Discord: Catch me if you can!
00,10I played this game on a computer back ages ago.
Dashite: So hungry they ate the blood off the floor.
/me uses portal gun to create portal to Equestria and jumps through right before it closes
wonder if fluttershy could befriend an alien
Hamsters planned this, i tell you hwhat
Shimmer: also a good movie
Your face gonna get hugged.
oh hi,we are just taking a nap before facehugging you
no one ever suspected a hamster
6keep talking
Meanwhile: nah, the bloodstains were all melted away by the acid.
I tricked my little brothers into watching Deep Blue Sea by saying Samuel L Jackson was the hero
11,01Dead face huggers.
See, hamsters are the Scarfies of the real world.
6it moves the text up the screen
They're just frozen.

She'd just be happy to be part of the process

the hamsters are coming
AdamThePony: "Ideeeaaaaa"

6I remember seeing that site once
Cousin to the brains in Department of Mysteries? That's right Alien takes place in the same universe as Harry Potter.
6it tripped me the hell out
6everything was moving
AdamThePony: Molestia's mom was a facehugger
Follow the leader

No wonder she's so weird acting.
04As long as it's not spammed as a "joke"

He's the black man, he gets to cuss
Surprise, it's a little girl.
CAAAAAAAAAT

almost dos, i think
Really, one word is all you need sometimes.
alien baby
I wonder how many of you heard of Akinator?
KIIIIIIDDDD!!! :O
shoot all the meatbags
03>Mods are supposed to enforce rules
HI NEWT! :P
03>I get yelled at for enforcing rules
03THis is fun.
Same Cypress. Told myself I wouldnt grow it long again. Now i'm not so sure
Yep, bring the one unarmed women to the front of the battlefield.
its a girl
00,10"nom"
That girl's wearing a ghillie suit.
bite him
I hate children
She looks like shit.
Its okay. We only tried to shoot you.
how could she survive for so long?
she is a shapeshifter
6mainly cuz I'll admit (probably the first to admit) BlueFlare gets a lot of crap from people here
...
yes
Yes
little girl is the cat of this movie?
She's a vampire!
SHOOT HER!
That girl is a spy!
shes feral
SPYCHECK THAT WILD CHILD
IT'S DITTO!
they dont need to outrun the alien, they just need to outrun the girl
I am the cat of the movie!
Hey, Hey, Hey! Stay out of mine shed!
00,10cool flashlight
She's the gerbil-girl!
Aliens are probably too big and awkward for the vents.
Big Badass Spess Mehreens: outwitted by a 9 year old
she a zombie
NEEEEEEEEEEWWWWWWWWWWT
04yeah, but NS is a mod and she's used it plenty of times without getting on trouble so some people might mistake it as favouritism/abusing power
AdamThePony BUT FRIENDLY FIRE'S ON!
at least she knows how to survive
There's a girl in this movie?
DAMN!
nice house
6welcome to the hell hole that is being a mod
Oh sure Ripley does not let the man into shuttle but she wants to protect the little sirl who might be infected?
I agree
how long has she had to live on her own
howd she get beads???
THAT explains the hamsters being alive!
She fed them!
I'm sure she's infested... :P
good point
First rule of infection movies, always shoot first.

00,10damit riply cant you go in to an alien situation with out picking up strays.
Anyone else play TF2?
Lamp: Yes. This is one of the few examples of a sequel that involves a kid where the kid doesn't end up making the movie worse
00,10first the cat now a kid.
07hurr
Nope
IYes
Lamp EVERYPONY
shes tired she wore herself out
first rule of horror movies, turn on some lights
04And people wonder why I dislike being given power.
Unfortunately for ripley, while Newt was not facehugged, she was still infected with the Rage Virus
second grade citizen
We named my new kitten. His name is Soarin! ^_^
Midnight_Fyre: It's because she doesn't talk :P
I miss the cat
Oh my
I need a virtual wall

Ponies47: Good shit

Sumica: Nah. He's white. :P

Dark92Enigma:
why do they think any of humans are alive
03Humanity itself is full of hypocricy
I wonder; did this girl model for any other horror characters?
Ponies47: Dont do it
Concentrate on Ripley's hair, it is far more bizarre than anything she has seen on the ship.
/me paints a white strip on a black cat
6yep
04Humanity is f*cked up, we get that.
03I'm not saying I'm not either.

f*ing enforce it til they cry
03but yes, I'll do it to everybody
Wow. Talk about blunt.

00,10sorry fmle exploded
Although I knew that much.
At least the kid is smart enough to realise it
00,10just a sec
6make their hearts bleed
DAMNIT NITT
Funner Fact, You're voiced by Tara Strong.
That biiffes
6and such
03LOL.
Noooooo WCOD
Fahk

Ripley looks stoned
03I'd actually make him cry but then you'd yell at me for it :(
So now you're imagining Twilight Sparkle being eaten by Zenomorphs
Tara Strong also voiced Raven
BUFFERING
03but nah

Everyday im buffering :D
03being serious, I'm not a mean person
STREAM OVER MAN! STREAM OVER!

Nittany_Discord blew up FMLE: :P
04I swear BlueFlare only used it like, once
as usual,we get the best still frames when the stream derps
03why do you think I don't like banning people
*Xenomorphs
Dashite: :D
02Actually, my eyes start to hurt if no one uses color. That’s why I don’t talk on #P-O very much
02XD
God actually had Tara Strong voice the human race.
Ironically.
this one is a perfect "oh shit" face moment
06I actually think
It won't make any difference because BUFFER
Meanwhile: This explains EVERYTHING
6which is why
6this is funny
TWILIGHT SPARKLE IS EVERYPONY
in 15 mins we wont need rockets to fly through space
07speaking of which
06if the rules say those colours are banned, they should be all-around banned
6and kyu
Vordox: He nuked it from orbit
Screencap anypony?
ironic how Articuno said that drf and Aurora are "an absolute pair"
That face says, I missed you buffer
07on more important matters
CHANGELINGS
... Wow, Tara Strong must have an extreme vocal range
why have the marines not accepted that everyone is dead yet
07!espeon

6absolute what
Lol.
11,01Sorry. I didn't mean to explode it.
I want to find a changeling and make it my little pet.
Dashite: It's Nitt...He can blow up anything he wants anywhere, Just look at Super Novas in the universe. XD

Dammit you guys are making me want to be social and sit cuddled up with someone while watching a film. DAMN YOU ^_^
Um, can anyone explain why stream no werk?
Ripley Can't Beleive it!
This is face I will see in my nightmares.
And I will call it morpheus.
04Absolute idiots.
06because otherwise it becomes all "Okay but how much is acceptable as funny joking xDDD and where is it breaking the rules?"
...THEY BLEW IT UP!
Hm. Is there something on the stream?
03LOL Drake
6thats fine by me
My little Newt
*sighs...
04Because we're all brothers and sisters in it now.

Nittany_Discord: Wait...You mean..You can't control your explosions? O.o
Stream is messed up, please stand by
FairysHuff: Excellent, the plan is working...

6if you haven't noticed
Lol :D mmmmmm Lamp (orgasiamerrarra voice)
Fenr: The stream can explode many, many more times than that.

03Aurora, it's because you agreed with me
Lamp: No, No such jokes here
Actually Newt is under the impression that everypony in town is playing the worst game of hide and go seek ever, THAT"S why they insist on finding the rest of the citizens
Newt turned into a face hugger!

Pyro Time!

That looks painful.
related: [03:06] <prunedtree> when people don't understand a paper, they usually think it's their fault... it's pretty intimidating :|
[03:07] <prunedtree> but it's pretty funny when you see a paper where they pretend they have a principled approach, and magically reach the final results, while it's pretty obvious they stumbled on them ;)
Polydunami, the one who was eaten by the T-Rex
Okay
Acid Bath
KEEP FIRING!
dayum son
PYROMANCERS :l
Get to the Tanka!!!!

And now the Traumatised space truck driver, 9 year old girl, and lawyer definitively show themselves to be more qualified than a platoon of Spess Mehreens
It's like Evil Dead up in this bitch?
Did nopony attend science in these marines?
or at least commandeered it
Those Marines are very unerleveled to tackle them
why don't they know acid for blood = shoot far away from them

Aliens vs. Terminator
Judge_Holden eggs
Hudson, a little girl is more badass than you.

Xenomorphs on the Titanic. There is a movie I want to see
Fuck you, Hudson, I'm a tiny child

I wonder what this movie would be like if it mixed with Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within.
Android!
how long is night? 16 days 23 hours?

they are severely inebreated.
I like Hudson. He's reacting the way most of us would be
KILL IT WITH FIRE!1
Actually...
btw,hudson has taken his half-melted arm quite well
That's a good idea.
Sumica: Boil 'em, Mash 'em, Stick 'em in a stew! Hope you've got a strong stomach
Fenr, he's just hiding it
Judge_Holden ok iirc the whole ship was mostly an egg carrier
Fenr: that's because it half melted his brain in the process
I should suggest Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within for Next Week.
how can they read this shit?
It's the perfect B Movie.
i only see lines
alexxm: hang out in the space jokey room den!

TIME BOMB INITIATED. YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES TO EVACUATE.
How much of this movie is left?
One up on doom guy

duct tape fixes everything
Doin drugs, one. last. time.

Where's Samus Aran when you need her?
Isaac clarke should learn about using duct tape
Ponies47: it's like 20 minutes maybe?
When in doubt, set something on fire
This is going to be a dust cloud the size of Nebraska.
ponibas: the lighning?
NUKE 'EM TILL THEY GLOW THEN SHOOT 'EM IN THE DARK :D
Riplie goes nuts. Thats maternal instincts for you

Shes after Mother Brain
Why do ships and buildings have self-destruct procedures?

Fenr: Close enoug
Fenr: duct taped gun
DO-DO-DO-DO, DO-DO-DO-DO.
Ellen Ripley, Xeno Hunter Extraordinaire

I've never actually seen any of the good Alien movies...heck, the only one I ever remember watching is Resurrection...
I wonder if this is a recuring theme in Ellen Ripley's life. Everywhere she goes the place ends up getting destroyed in a nuclear explosion.
03you should watch more porn then
/me runs
Darf14: I don't think Newt can energy drain the queen though
2Lmao no thanks
Smoke 'em if you got 'em

There is no alien resurrection
Lady who worked on a mining ship is better aty fighting aliens than space marines

If Metroid gets a movie, they need to have Ripley as Samus.
Just saying.

HAI BUCKERS; Time to "BUY SOME APPLES" your PLOTS!

Fenr: duct taped gun or the iwillpwnubeyatch
Ripley is more badass than your entire Marine Corp.

00,10you should see her weading day Barbetos
AdamThePony: but samus is blonde.
TheRareP0N3: She got nabbed by an alien.
AdamThePony: I think she's kinda old to play Samus now...
She look crazy
I love how she has absolutely no armor on...
alien resurrection was directed by Joss Whedon... just to let you know...
Na
Meanwhile: inb4pregnant
fenr's mind trick failed still like ressurrection

Well, Samus isn't exactly young.

/me invents a gun that shoots rolls of duct tape
11,01Crap.
00,10she's gonna regreat not jaming that elevator door
You have to remember, she's got Chozo blood.
11,01Movie has to derp at the end.
TheRareP0N3: Captured by baliens. Ripley is going to save her
armor VS walls-eating acid
/me shoots at Nerom
and she was in stasis for a long while.
makes sense not bothering with it
lol
Chozo blood is best blood
He also directed Avengers. Win some, lose some.
Midnight_Tempest: IIRC, it was his first movie, and it was pretty bad.
So that'd kinda make sense.
00,10her popcorn is done

Midnight_Tempest: you seen kirz anytime today?
Pinkies4thWall: Seems legit
Distortion: The movie isn't bad.
Matrix alowes me to not be harmed by bullets
