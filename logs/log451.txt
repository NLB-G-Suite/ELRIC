Nah, it's not pony
Oh

They said it's rainbow colored fish fillet.
O_O
Which is strange
and a rainbow colored hotdog?
becouse i have a normal one
I never knew ponies could eat fish
(tastes heart)
o.o
It's 7 am Eastern time/6 am Central.
Exited for the AI finale?
(pukes)
O_O
Wut?
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
I made them myself.
Let's see what's showing on rerun hour today.
Cant say I have.
^
oops
05Whoofs
05please go read the rules
:/
whoos?
:/
Whoofs*
Someone just got klined? :oo
...
thank you for reminding us of a fic that;s been around for a year
any other's?
OH look it's Ashleigh Ball's band :O
umm
forget i said that
:(
XD
but good one
its like a clopfic
care to enlighten us of another fic we all know about that's been around for a year?
/me facehoofs once more
(facehoofs)
How bout we not talk about fics for a while?
Correct word
05www.bronystate.net/rules
05read those before you get yourself banned
Recommended that you do.
xD
/me sighs
Thats mean
Rainbow Dash Loves Soaring :P
This is a friendly place.
05good riddance.
he had it coming
Oh.
I see we lost him.
Wait
Am I getting banned?
Why ello there
Oh
*sigh* I only have Twilight's to do :(
I remember in D2 I made a necromancer
lol.
O: Still the most fun one though
Oh yes. I can't wait to start on it >_>
hehe
I find summoning classes useful because
Twilight's one is going to be very hard. man.
Even if the summons aren't strong enough to do damage to bosses
They can be used as meatshields
Because I was a terrible necromancer
Yeah, but if I remeber correctly it lacks hard hitter units, which are needed in boss fights
Just listening to that yatta song
Why? Because I can
I'll play too
Because
I HAVE AN IDEA
I say
:o
We should all pool our moneys togethor, buy a mansion
And make it like
Or something
Except
Free.
I DID IT AGAIN Dx
/me doesent have a laptop.
*sigh*
I think I type too fast
mores spaces, less enter and you'll be fine
Advice taken.
Has anyone played Cry of Fear?
!cd
:/
How would we maintain a free hotel?
:o
Why would we need that?
Also when the international congress for the foundation of Equstria needs to be held
NO
*Equestria
The mansion
/me has a massive and unstable imagination.
I assuming the nation had yet to be founded
*i'm
Uh
Not sure
If not, it was close to that, right?
with that money you could buy a 1000-1200 squaremeter land where I live, but you'd need about additional 10 times this sum to build a mansion there :D
Dat post oO
Ok, how about this
AND PUSH THEM INTO EQUESTRIA
If it were that easy. >>
We should all purchase an island in the middle of nowhere (Which is possible) and then just live there in peace and harmony.
I thought about it and I wouldnt want to live in Equestria
I wouldn't either
Hay, grass, and flowers don't exactly make a great meal for humans.
That, and I just wouldnt belong there.
But seriously, though, salad is awesome.
Don't think I'd be able to live without cola, though.
Eh. I just can't properly imagine myself in Equestria.
But you know.
^ wat
here we go http://www.reddit.com/r/t:2022/comments/rnhy2/bronys_buy_africa_and_rename_it_equestria/

OR We find an Asteroid (named Tom) and very carefully bringit down to earth...bit by bit or hollow it and live inside it...
