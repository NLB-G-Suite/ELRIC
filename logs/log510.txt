wat
14o.o
Have only seen the first Toy Story
13on a rating from "kinda cute" to "KAWAII DESU", how would you rate it? :D
/me runs
lalallala
04I would rate it "Your face"
13that's a rather subjective rating
13is my face high or low on the scale? ;3
ohohoho
04I'll let you decide ;3
EYEBROWS!
http://www.animegalleries.net/img/54167
I rate it "Angel_Umbreon"
They are good, but you shant be tempted by them.
13still a subjective rating D:
/me shrugs at otakon~
for espeon
lol
For style I guess~
not sure how this works or how it's related to cuteness
but idc
13;D
13it works both ways
/me uses Ninjazz's gliding and surfs on him
gliding?
gonna bail out now for sum sleeps. Enjoyed the movienight! Cheerz
^-^
suggestiveness and cuteness are both related to moe, after all
04Angel is a suggestive rating
13:3c
suggestiveness and cuteness makes for a functional combination.
04Indeed
called moe
05howssat?
05damn this place is empty
That's Audioslave, isn't it?

I was going to attempt doing a sprite or draw my OC... but I'm busy rewriting my story
Well I'm sure I heard somewhere that exercise releases endorphins
Besides, I have jotted down some ideas for my third story. I'm just holding back
lol i like sloooow chats :)
I haven't changed any settings
And I've had a good day thanks
"Ninja Star" hehe.
I was looking around Olly's Uni.
ok
Came up with Bladester or the like.
I'll think of it more as I develop the plot. I still like the idea of the two being brothers.
it's really horrible to be honest
:)
I want the third story to revolve around Cloudsdale. I feel like throwing in some more pegasi
but I was hereish!

Saturn, if it weren't for us revolting and making our own country, America's government would be in yours
08,01i just can't stand the guy's voice, though
I thought about doing it, but wasn't motivated.
08,01sagas: in all honest, i actually know *nothing* about history
From chocolate discussions... to War discussions
Like how I stopped after 500 words in chapter 5 of my story. I felt like taking a break.

Saturn: Germans dont sound very fun
Germans are the most fun people
