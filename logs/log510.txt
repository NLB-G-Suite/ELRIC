Dat insult.
I've always wanted to shoot plates
Oh dayum...

Waste all the ammo
Pittsburgh: and then the avengers put them all to shame
/me licks Nittany_Discord

My schools never had any dances. Shame
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Wichita (Emma Stone) is the only character whose name is not the name of a state capital.
SHE ONLY DATES YOU BEACUSE THERE IS NOT ANYONE ELSE
Darkts3|Ohioan|MLG: And good ridence. What a waste of a class

My prom was suppose to take place on a yacht. Until the economy backrupdet the boating company. :P
They need like... thirty more rules
Wait what?
This is one of the most dumbest scenes in zombie movie history....
look sfun
gaiz, I think teh slenderman is right outside mai house
Pittsburgh: AND THEY DIDNT TAKE IT!?
Seems legit...
Nothing bad's going to happen at all...
I have a feeling, that more cameos are incomming in Zombieland 2
IshBestPony: well let him in silly, its rude to make guests wait outside
13I'm back :B
1,11sagas: either they didn't take it, there were conflicting schedules or they just weren't available.

You've Alerted the Horde...
yep
Again with the bad ideas
NOOOO
and once again LETS TURN ON ALL OF THE LIGHTS THE ZOMBIES WILL NEVER FIND US HERE
*Sirens sound*
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The amusement park scenes were filmed at Wild Adventures Theme Park, in Valdosta, GA.

LIGHTS AND SOUNDS WILL ATTRACT ZOMBIES
This is bad...
TheWeirdPony: classic human ingenuity
6$2.69
6here
6:'D
1,11Well...that place *WAS* zombie-free
STUPID MODE ENABLED
BEST - IDEA - EVER
L4D2 theme carnival reference?
the stupidity is amazing
Because turning on an amusement park in a zombie infested wasteland is a good idea
Every zombie for miles around.
Screw recapturing my childhood. I wanna live!
11,01A GA theme part in CA.
13dollars aren't the same as pounds though xD
Zombies: Let's all go to the circus!!!!!
6exactly
13also Y U SPAM ME WITH HUGS

wheeeeeee
6CUZ I COULD
pretty lights
6I would have continued
6but
I just can't.
this is fun
6 20 seconds wait for each message
How did they survive this long with intelligence like that?
11,01The zombies are like "Dude! The Park's Open!"
Ooooh... Look: A Light
zombies are only where there were people
Oh yeah zombies...
/me wants hugs

Kiddieland!
wheeeeee boomboom wheeee
Ide leave and go to mexico
Maseo: could have been a giant safe house =/
1,11Actually, a theme park would be real ideal for a zombie-pocolypse.
good point
I have taken over the filly rainbow dash desktop pony. I can make her fly. Right now I have Luna (season 2) Filly dash Vynal Scratch adn, Lyra
though
DashWithRainbows: They only eat living prey, hence not eating eachother and the dead bodies everywhere
Unless it's the Hoover Dam powering the place, how do they still have electricity?
Maseo: this is the 12 year old girl's idea. Of COURSE so!
xD
ill accept that
Pittsburgh: Yeah, turn everything on then leave.
Pittsburgh: How the hell do you figure?
Pittsburgh: L4D2
"It's the FREAKING MUSTACHIOOOOOOO"-Profound moments in left 4 dead 2
Well they're screwed now
Attract all the zombies to the noise and keep them out of everything else.
aw, it should've exploded.
because destroying the vehicle will keep the zombies away
Gnome Chompski will save everyone
L4D2 EVERYWHERE
they need ladnadnadnum
Pittsburgh: yeah, lots of non perishable foods, tons of different buildings to hide out in, fences and whatnot for defense
11,01Hunter!
killing spree
how many shots does that thing have!?
if you guys look closely you can see the peanut mascot from Dark Carnival
You know what? Buffering is only a problem when it's happening, and I haven't had any buffering in a while now. Problem solved.
SECOND - BEST IDEA - EVER
rage mode activated
Smoker
RAWRity: Ide still avoid it
That's the worst goodbye ever.
Thing is, this -could- be a smart thing too. Activate the lights, set up a killzone, wipe out the zombies and suddenly you've cleared out half the town.
Thatll do, pig
DashWithRainbows: apparently infinite
1,11There's tons of food, plenty of cover and high ground to take as well as lots of hiding places, There's tons of dangerous rides and equipment that can be turned into zombie-killing traps...the only downside is you'd have to get your ammo somewhere else.
Darkts3|Ohioan|MLG: And now I have the image of a minigun weilding Garden Gnome in shades.
That was a bit of a low blow
that was deep
Like a boss.

makes me laugh everytime
One just might wonder who will win at the end of them ovie

Nittany_Discord: Pretty lights are pretty

Where's a pipe bomb when you need it?
sagas who needs nutrution when you have twinkies
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: With the exception of Wichita, Tallahassee's son, Cynthia Nickerbocker, and famous people, no other names are mentioned in the movie. This includes Columbus' neighbor, 406, and his made-up lover, Beverly Hills.
11,01Yes/
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Fine...
Meanwhile: Survival Zombies are Hoarder Zombies
sagas why do you need that when you got fastfood :O
SHOOT THE CONTROL BOZ
oh
killerpony7733: Cant survive off theme park food
And now your traped
i can
And now you're stuck
for a few days
killerpony7733: Like you cant off fast food
NOW THEY'RE TRAPPED FOREVER
13fff
NO, LEAVE THEM THERE
And theme parks rely on food refridgration
Zombies: No fair, we can't ride anymore!
sagas well idunno about that might depend really :D
MadSurge: wait until the zombies get bored and leave, climb down.
13that "more stuff" folder is stuck in my recycle bin
1,11sagas: You'd be surprised what you can live off of.
Be a Hero!
this had to be the dumbest idea of all zombie realted stuff,even more stupid to "hey guys let's build a zombie prof city but let the west side open beacuse zombies cant get through water duuuuuur"
Like a Baus
13cuz I can't permanently delete it from there
like a boss
talahasee is boss
ZOMBIE LAND
13I managed to get rid of "stuff" in one go, but that other one is still there xD
I swear. I really identify with Columbus most of the time.
RAWRity: Do you think zombies can starve to death?
/me 11,01dusts Maidsurge
overkill :D
Talahasse is the man.
1,11Dat Rule #2
Pittsburgh: It wouldnt be very ideal food. A lot of it is refridgerated or would rot too
MadSurge: yes, actually. At least in this universe.
Kandarihu|BuddyBear: i feel ya
Thanks Nittany_Discord! :D
pacific play land mehhh its pacific zombie land
Pittsburgh: could barely read that
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Unadjusted for inflation, this is the highest-grossing movie in the US to begin with the letter "Z".
Start working on that 3 part apology :D
Since they're not "zombies" so much as they are "hyper-aggreisive plague victims"
In B4 good song =D
RAWRity: because they're still alive people, right?
1,11Bronysith: it said Double Tap
MadSurge: in this one, yes.
it did
Pittsburgh: i mean when you said rule # 2 it was really blurry lol
Talahasse is so badass you don't even know.
AIRHORN
time for coffee and cereal
lol
"You've Alerted the Alerted Horde"
he is one BAMF
and thus, we have one of the greatest actions scenes ever put to film.
Tallahassee is nice this time of year!
they don't see Columbus...
1,11This movie has the most realistic explination for Zombies, IMO.
RAWRity: That exagerting a bit
Murder.
Pittsburgh: its l4d the movie
What /was/ their explanation for zombies?
sagas: bullshit.
Let's go troll CZW with the airhorn :D
MadSurge, JEEZUS.
Pittsburgh: Hopefully to be beat by World War Z
11,01Came from bad meat.
Pittsburgh: mad cow disease? :D

Nittany_Discord: Mc Donald's Pink Slime =/
I never noticed this last night. A haunted house with REAL zombies!
WallDives: Botchamania! /)
MadSurge, new one's out today.
RAWRity: I read the book. I think itde be better as an HBO series

GASP
WallDives: I don't care for wrestling but Botchamania is pretty fun anyway :D
its a video game :D
Somebody fund that ride.
1,11Meanwhile: It's a plague-like disease that makes the brain grow twice as big. It causes severe fever, intense aggresiveness, loss of higher brain function and a "major case of the munchies."
RAWRity: Well now you made me sad. I wanted the book
Thanks Silver.
Otherwise... The Rage Virus

Hammer time
reminds me of l4d2
Eh, some people hate clowns.
DED
You know, anything is scary when its drooling blood.
you can hear the horn sound xD
Clown ball shot
Stop hammer time
sagas, they aren't that funny either =P
i am terrified of clowns
1,11Actually, Tallehasse takes up the best defensive position in a theme park: Protected from all sides, slots for blasting zombies outside, and a "reload station" that makes it take literally 3 seconds to reload.
honk
i cant stand clowns
i dont mind the people out of costume
but clowns just freak me out
inkBot: I really dont see the appeal of clowns
Yes, but it has no exit.
Om i don't really think so blood really can't make me feel scared :D
Pittsburgh: its a double edged sword if you think about it
Me neither
what about the double tap?
Oh, look: It is the movie where Abigail Breslin was still cute
sagas, me neither.
Nyst: it's meant as a last stand place.
Pittsburgh: I feel the gate thing would brake
double SMASH
Seriously. Cole Porter's song "Be a Clown" was so sweer. And Stephen King had to ruin it
1,11Bronysith: Only if you don't keep your a-game up.
No time to hug
sagas: I see it, but only if they look like humans :D
swwet*
Kill zombies
Hmm, it's getting laggy again
...
KILL THEM NOW
Pittsburgh: pretty easiy
how about helping the cowboy?
NOW KISS (and repopulate)
A longsword? Please. The thing would be so heavy that it is even harder to use then a regular sword, not to mention slow. As for a shield and gladius, do you know just how heavy a roman shield is?
double tap that
Her real name :P
WHOAAAAAA
Krista
killerpony7733: If you find something drooling blood in real life. I'll hear your reaction then xD

Funny mental or mindbleach mental?
WorldTraveler: a few people. Didnt you just watch it?

hey Spell-of-Gaming hows your day been
It killed them.
I have a secondary choice if you guys want to to give it to you
All that I can say that the only thing that qualifies it as a movie is that it lasts almost 2 hours.
but its a b movie so its okay
XD
SCREW THE MOVIE SHOW THE PONIES
Judging by IMDB this movie is bad
EXTREME
WorldTRaveler: is it good troll 2 style or good justin bieber concert movie style ?
sagas: but its so twisted and messed up
RX-78-SweetieBot: why did you tab yourself?
Pittsburgh: Wait... Is this the one where the sheep is killing people?
Pittsburgh: can't be more fucked up than 4chan.
You think I'm kidding?
ZombieBrony: Watched it last night. very bad
One guy had an aneurysm during the showing.
no clue
RX-78-SweetieBot: it's a film noir style movie that was STRAIGHT to video starring ALL kids.
sergio_scriptor: it's probably somewhere in between.
11,01Fair warning: You may never looks at sheep again after this film.
MadSurge: If I'm right. T4chan grew off this film.
I would rather watch Bunnicula
11,01Or farmers.
0,14 A moment of silence for those lost.

Seriously, whoever thought this movie was a good idea needs to be FINED and have their director's license revoked and NEVER even allowed to plan as much as a party AGAIN.
11,01WorldTraveler: No video links during stream please.
how obscure is this movie? I can't find a wikipedia page for it?
/me has never seen this movie
Ictiv: Still doomed.
Pinkie_Kittie: But I already watched most of it yesterday. I got to the point where they fell into the pit
Nyst: you'll see someone wear a sheep skin soon
Personally I think this movie is awesome.
but its Black sheep its fun and ironic
this film sucks baaaaaaaadly
its Black sheep, the song
Kencolt: So many thatAll I'm seeing is them, and only hear the soundtrack?

HURRAH!
Ponies can play instruments without fingers :p
Even though the settlers need the land to grow their orchard, it's true that the land really does belong to the Buffaloes. And the settlers really don't have any historic claim to the land.

I LOVE THAT LINE!
BAAAA AAAAA , it's sheep
SHE SAYD BODY INSTEAD OF PONY
OMG
No one is ever rational and reasonable
TWILIGHT's attack was lowered!
It doesn't help that the land is really lacking in natural resources. I think it's mentioned that the orchard is in the only piece of fertile land around.
Its the end of the worlddd!!! Oh NOess!!
pies are best weapons
Lil_B they aren't kicking, they're buckin'
piie
pffft screw gravity
Fuck tha buffalo, we're BAKING PIES
pie = best weapon
Intense pie making
Frankly, a better deal would've involved the buffaloes stampeding over the other land to make it usable for growing crops. Then the buffaloes get their entire ancestral homeland while the Aplloossians have land to maintain the orchard... although this means that all of the trees would have to be relocated.
so... they can't move dem trees, because then they wouldn't have anything to eat... Yet they have enough to prepare a whole cavalry worth iof pies to serve as weapons.
CCCP: Ofc!!!
It cant be the only fertile soil around, what do the buffalos eat then?
Nyst: I know. I dont see why the buffalo have a valid point
BONK!
mushy stuff

that's what bre said.
suggestiveness and cuteness are both related to moe, after all
04Angel is a suggestive rating
13:3c
suggestiveness and cuteness makes for a functional combination.
GilDash: Oh, its nice~ the cocolate gets on my fingers and around my mouth tho, still warm and moist.
04Indeed
called moe
05howssat?
Om: : L
Om: You're gonna get told off in a minute...
GilDash: Why? Its chocolate. And they are fresh. Best time to eat them
Om: Chocolate is chocolate, not cookies, silly. :p
05damn this place is empty

Wrek: regulars are mostly here now

Vordox Sprite Isaac Clarke
Om: Chocolate isn't cookies. :D
Barbetos: Too late, flutter_spin had the first dibs :P
/me shrugs
GilDash: Stop being so pickey, you just jelly I haz cookies~
As long as your not bored right?
Om i agree with GilDash chocolate is chocolate they aren't cookies
My computer derped. Did anypony ping me? :(
RX-78-SweetieBot: you still about?
Ponies47: Ping
ponibas: no
GODDAMMIT TAB FAIL
Ponies47 I ping you no. does that count?

Chocolate? Cookies? What?

killerpony7733: You just keep to that, and I'll eat my sweets
okay, brb guys
alexxm: it's the BUCK emblem
alexxm: believe it or not... its a pony
Om i don't mind i can always buy REAL cookies
thanks otakon
His image might have changed ever so slightly as I wrote the story, but its still the base
alexxm: np
killerpony7733: These are REAL cookies. I made them silly
Om and maybe i'll get some for GilDash too :D
damn now I'm bored
dear Bronystate. I've probably said something similar before, but... I dont' know if exercise is an anti-depressent or if I'm just addicted, but it's a helluva drug
NullRadix: you're loony
why thank you
NullRadix: exercise hurts us, yes it does precious *GOLLUM, GOLLUM*
pain is weakness leaving the body!
NullRadix: I'd hardly say that's a bad thing. :)
also, it stops hurting once you've conditioned yourself
I was going to attempt doing a sprite or draw my OC... but I'm busy rewriting my story
im bored =/ someone say something funny
Bronystate is best drug
unless you continue to push yourself like a madman
NullRadix: then when I did those burnouts several years ago and COULDN'T MOVE THE NEXT DAY I should have been damn near invulnerable...
Well I'm sure I heard somewhere that exercise releases endorphins
Besides, I have jotted down some ideas for my third story. I'm just holding back
NullRadix: Then you just condition yourself further. :)
Darkts3|Ohioan|MLG: something funny
prince-lemon: i laughed..
prince-lemon as do lemons
lol i like sloooow chats :)
So it is enjoyable, and to a certain extent 'addictive' to some people
I'm trying to do more with Ninjazz, but I just don't care for "Night Star"
hiya prince-lemon how are you today? also, your bot has kicked me goddamn twice today and like 6 times yesterday have you changed your settings?
Ohai
so what do you guys think of next weeks movies
I haven't changed any settings
alexxm: kinda boring
And I've had a good day thanks
"Ninja Star" hehe.
hey GabeMoist hows your day been
I was looking around Olly's Uni.
alexxm: the B will be a instant WMC if they can actually FIND a copy of it on the net.
ok
flutter_spin, clever. :3
GilDash: You are showing so much restraint :) good it. Whos a good it :3
prince-lemon: nice and hiya GabeMoist YOU WON!
Came up with Bladester or the like.
Om: The mods are all around me. :S
otakon, I won a new car?
otakon: apparently Nittany loves movies that appear to have no info
otakon from what i see it has no wikipedia page
GabeMoist: no, A movie!
I'll think of it more as I develop the plot. I still like the idea of the two being brothers.
Sweet
alexxm: it has a website
GilDash: The mods are nice people :) why so worried?
You guys want the B movie website?
What's the B Movie?
Om GilDash knows restraint when theres need for it
it's really horrible to be honest
its funny how ppl that win the lottery... arent in the chat during the lottery
:)
I want the third story to revolve around Cloudsdale. I feel like throwing in some more pegasi
Om: killerpony7733 has more sense then you ever will. :p
I was in chat the one time I won the lottery... for a pony episode...
killerpony7733: Yes. But need is such a strong word
well... i think I was playing a game cuz it was eurostream
NullRadix: i respect you
Are we finally watching the animated titanic movies for B Movie?
I love the miniWrek there in the corner
but I was hereish!
/me f2k takayan - Last battle (2chFLAC@992kbps/2:47)
GilDash: yeah true i kinda hate making sense mostly so eh :D
GilDash: I have no need for "sense"
life is like a pox of docoaltes
http://www.hawkjones.info/ GabeMoist here
THAT is the B movie that GHOSTIES picked
Hawk Jones
CCCP: Life is like a Box of Diseases. Hard to ignore it
Oh my
Oh, I see Wrek still drawing that BUCK design.
Darkts3|Ohioan|MLG: yup :)
Yes every pony --- Dr. Whooves and Assistant Episode 2 is OUT
brb guys, gonna do a quick escort mission in Dragon's Dogma
Jones, Hawk Jones
otakon: Dragon's Dogma is best Boss game
flutter_spin: I like waggoner's rendition better to be honest
Darkts3|Ohioan|MLG: agreed, even at level 80 cyclopses are fun to fight
brb
otakon: Oh my lord that's an awesome movie~
GabeMoist, why would you pick that movie?
GilDash: Besides, killerpony7733 can have all the sense he/she wants. I have other things in mind right now.
sagas, what?
night guys
/me dances
and with that one "~" Nyria killed the chat for 1:01
I find it crazy the number of hours it took for people to do stuff. The guy spent 180 hours on that Boys who like Ponies animation and it was like ... 4 minutes long
Night night alexxm :)
Om thats quite true
GabeMoist: You picked Hunchback of Notre DAme. Why?
Om: I'd like to add a few more things to that mind of yours. ;)
EVERYPONY SAY GOOD NIGHT TO alexxm :[
LIKE FIRE
HELLFIRE
String_Shredder: Hmph~ Not my fault~
THIS FIRE IN MY SKIN
Then again, look how long Mane6 has been working on their project. Yeesh
awwe alexxm left before I could say goodbye :'(
GilDash: Its a bit tight in there, I hope you don't mind.
That's why, sagas
There now you feal bad because you did say goodbye or good night to alexxm :|

Hey there, Scoot-Scootaloo!
11,01Hi Scoots
String_Shredder, I do what I want
Good evening Scoot-Scootaloo
I take orders from no one
Teh|Spitfire: Skype.
GabeMoist: Because Hellfire?
/me had a GREAT time at the meet.
GabeMoist: then why you follow rules..... i thought so
/me hugs Scoot-Scootaloo hello
also, hai guys
Scoot-Scootaloo: Holla! :)
Hey there, Pinkies4thWall!
I follow the rules because I haven't felt like breaking them
Me and the rules are simply in alignment for the time being
psh. following the rules is just knowing which ones can be bent
GabeMoist: seems rite
Guys i just got back from a state brony meet. I spent $60 on pony swag
And i had the time of my life
00,03The most I ever spent at a bronymeet was Bronycon. My wallet hurts :(
The most I ever spent at a bronymeet was $0
lol
In all seriousness, I haven't had a time where I just left to do some meeting like that... not even a concert
sombody call Scoot-Scootaloo's wallet an Amber Lamps
Dear Princess Celestia, I'm so alone
GabeMoist: And moist
GabeMoist: What a Story Mark
One time I did go with my family to an IMAX to see Dark Knight, and I did drive 11 hours to see my bro.
Ive only ever purchased one mlp/Brony item
Also at this meet the public relations staff for BroNYCon showed up, as well as a few of the guys from Brohoof Brony. It was SO great
/me hugs GabeMoist
blind bags. That's it for me. Close to purchasing a 'brony' t-shirt at the mall but I didn't like it.
you calling Angel cute?
cuz this isn't false
:3c
flutter_spin: http://img189.imageshack.us/img189/7568/flutterspin.png
Went to Comic-con 3 times with my brother on professional business when he had a booth for TheBehemoth company for Tom Fulp, but ehhh
cool, Vordox -- that was like super fast
A quick modified Sprite from another DP :P
just recolored?
08,01wow, wrek
08,01that's coming on so well
Changed Hair, Tail, recoloured the rest pretty much
You wanted a Full scratch like Wrek? :P
any program you used?
flutter_spin: Can't tell what Program I use, it's Illegal XD
lol
Vordox: illegal?
sagas: Yes and no....Borrowed.:P
Vordox got compies of Paint off the black market
Like how I borrow games from my cousin.
Vordox: I know that feel. I use a pirated photoshop CS6
GabeMoist: Kinda. :P
Sagas: Bah, only newbs uses EZShop Adobe
Real pro uses MSPaint
This song. ^^
That horn looks like it would hurt.
I have Photoshop CS13
i have Photoshop CS3... =/
Vordox: well that hurts deep
GabeMoist: The non-existent one?
No, I got it from the future
08,01Om: don't piss off Britannia
Sagas: It's true, why do you think everyone and their Boss uses Photoshp, cause it's "good"? :p
Om: Wanna give it a try? ;)
08,01i think tomorrow I'll dye my jeans
lol. I thought it would take hours to do, but you just did it like a couple minutes. Then again, I did want to do like a trottle also.
08,01Om: ha! <3
A trott?
...
GilDash: Try what I ask? Getting skewerd?
whats with the brony pirates =/
If I use the modified Caramel one it may take a few minutes :p
hi Vordox
Bah, I haven't done any scratch walk yet.
Hai CCCP
yeah a trott. That word still bugs me, but I guess that is what is used.
Wow, I got my butt kicked in Worms
08,01GabeMoist: tee hee
Vordox: You mean heil comorad CCCP!
Om: I'd be gentle. ;)
08,01sagas: oh? how?
Hello every one who is streaming?
sagas: lol
hi cow334
flutter_spin: I prefer doing Scratch stuff, like Wrek's Pony or VioletVanillas or Phase's.
Hey cow334 Wrek
oh no... hope nobody tried to talk to me... left the page open and left the computer...
08,01inb4 "we saved your ass in World War 2"
08,01oh, just missed it
08,01well
I started playing Black Ops and I just couldn't stop laughing. "How did brony CCCP get his own missile?"
08,01inb4 "we ssaved yours in WW3"
GilDash: Getting stabed is still getting stabed, no matter how polite you want to be.
BRB
08,01sagas: and we could have handled those Krauts fine ourselves, thank you very much
08,01we were doing just fine
Pffff... Nah not going there
Ninjazz: Where?
bye
Jeebus...
I am not following the stream much atm. So excuse me if this is an obvious question..what song is playing right now
?
To bed.
flutter_spin: Those trots look HARD to do O.o
Om: Tsk, I'd never stab you. :)
yeah Vordox :P
Ninjazz: lol
flutter_spin: I guess I'll not do it for this time. >< That looks WAY too hard to even modify D:
Om, :3c
08,01this band sounds like what would happen if someone gave Matt Bellamy a labotomy
08,01which band is it?
You might be able to pull the sprite from the file and recolor each frame Vordox
Well one modified sprite is enough, wanted to try something hard and your OC hair was a mess. XD
08,01i like the instrumentals, and the lyrics
GilDash: No, you would never do anything like that would you.
08,01i just can't stand the guy's voice, though
flutter_spin: I know, I'm looking at each one now
Ninjazz: Fight the powah!
I thought about doing it, but wasn't motivated.
Om: Of course I wouldn't. :(
08,01sagas: in all honest, i actually know *nothing* about history
From chocolate discussions... to War discussions
Like how I stopped after 500 words in chapter 5 of my story. I felt like taking a break.
aaaw
song ended
still dont know title
08,01anyhoos, someone tell me what band that was
:/+
GilDash: Especially not with a horn?
sagas: Germany was already spreading itself too thin by that point. Their supplies weren't getting to them fast enough. In reality, it could have been close either way.
Om, RO RO FIGHT DA POWAH!
Germans are the most fun people
08,01sagas: i love germans
you speak lies sagas
Zos Vacky Germans
I think my cat is feeling cold...
A friend of mine loved Audioslave and wouldn't stop talking about the album. I know them very well.
08,01last year i spent my summer in Germany, and that was one of th emost fun summers i've ever had
Huray for being part german, even my last name is german.
Guten Abend.. What is tghis talk about Germany?
08,01maybe...
sagas: wat?
08,01i do seem to remember doing a lot of dancing
08,01and i don't generally dance
08,01but i rememeber *wanting* to dance
08,01so somethign funny must have been going on
Darkts3|Ohioan|MLG: what wat?
Germans are fun to dance with
08,01i found out that most germans have terrible taste in music
GilDash: I know you would never hurt anyone :) don't be silly
08,01Vi Vi being the obvious exception
define terrible
Germans: Fun to dance with but not a funny bone in there body
08,01and also, Austrians are hot
and bread
08,01Darkts3|Ohioan|MLG: beer not good for sausage intergrity
08,01sagas: my god, swedish spitfire...
08,01i suggested to GalaCon that they should get Swedish Spitfire
08,01's VA
My cousin married someone from Phillipines. True story.
08,01and they took me seriously
05funny thing, i have no idea what the big deal is
08,01so now they're trying to get her, i think
08,01sagas: no, she's voiced by a very, very sexy sounding lady
lol, tshirt eh wrek?
epple paaahhh
sagas: Uh oh. The last thing I need to hear is Stupid Sexy Swedish Spitfire. :$
lol, dat link Cobellanez
I won't link it here.
Wrek: i freaking know right?
GilDash: You know you wanna hear
GilDash: Why? She has sexy in her name.
GilDash, I absolutely love her voice.
At least it isn't manly Spitfire
:P
08,01Chrysalis: ahem
08,01John de fucking Lancie
lol
08,01how much more sexy do you want to get?
yes, but he is godly, not sexy
dude, that's his middle name?
:P
08,01to quote our treasurer: VOICE. LIKE. TREACLE.
Get's stuck to your eyebrows?
08,01MysteryGuitarDash: basically
May I post a video link since its only Wrek drawing?
Why did i put an apostrophe in that sentce? :S
08,01MysteryGuitarDash: wait, why are you putting treacle in your eyebrows?
sagas, nope
08,01GilDash: well spotted
No reason 0-0
We could just get someone ... saxy http://vocaroo.com/i/s0XIxGklfDJr :P
08,01MysteryGuitarDash: you're either very silly, or very kinky
GabeMoist: Awwwe but there isnt much to watch atm
ALL THREE
flutter_spin: i dont get it
its saxypretender
08,01sagas: if you want to post a video link, ask Wrek, since he's streaming
flutter_spin: ohhhhhhhh
GilDash: I think it has little to do with your eyees
08,01flutter_spin: no audio links either, please
That might have been a bit borderline.. .yeah I was just typing that.
00,03Saxy sounds like me O_O
Even though I doubt hes watching the chat, Wrek may I post a video link in the chat?
08,01Scoot-Scootaloo: saxy does not sound like you
BACK :)
08,01saxy has a sexy, southern voice
wat
^
00,03But he's from New York...
Derp
Om: Hey, I've got eyes like a hawk. The only person finding out damned tent pegs when we were packing up was me. :D
sagas: Wrek rarely allows such things, almost no point asking :p
Ikr
00,03Wait, aren't you talking about Slurry?
GilDash: As long as you don't have eyebrows like a hawk. And get treacle stuck in them.
Shimmer: Awwwwee
08,01oh
08,01wait
08,01yes
Doh
But I wanna post sexy spitfire voice!
GilDash: Is that all you can find is small things?
08,01i was thinking about slurry
MysteryGuitarDash: No, because that would just be silly. Hawks don't have eyebrows.
08,01slurry's voice is magical
yeah, me too sagas
But my mummy said so
j/k
I can't think of a pic at the moment to post.
Om: It's hard to find something big enough to satisfy me. ;)
08,01flutter_spin: draw my OC making out with Swedish Spitfire
08,01then post.
lol
08,01i'm being totally serious!
GilDash: That's certainly true :D
...
GilDash: So your good eyes, they help you how?
flutter_spin, include moths and argyle socks
lots of argyle socks
08,01Darkts3|Ohioan|MLG: psht, my OC is married.
SOARINS APPLE PIE
08,01hi!

08,01Wrek: i not only expect it, but mandate it!
Wrek: !

08,01i'm gonna give you the biggest hug in August
!
08,01it'll be aweomse
Wrek: May I post a link in chat?
I was going to post a guy who did sexy Spitfire with .... well, let's just say it might be too saucy for here
Om: They may not help me, but they certainly help other ponies out. ;)
its John Joseco aint it
08,01flutter_spin: pm. now.
Honestly, look it up. Swedish spitfire's voice sure is sexy!
GilDash: I have realetively poor eyesight, its got to be rather noticable for me to pick it out. How would you help me there?
Om: That depends. What am I picking out for you?
PLUSHIE COMPILATION! SO MANY THINGS I CANT AFFORD!
05i dont knwo 'boput you guys

prince-lemon: of course they hide the hand hole
Thanks

08,01Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: you mean Legolas' quiver?
But Wrek, I can't understand it, but I like the vocals
Ponies47: TIME TO JOIN THE HERD
Ponies47: Did you give him the welcome wagon?
05give me a sec to translate
GilDash: If only we could push towards finding something that would make it perfect, perhaps you have to put multiple things togather hmm?
MadSurge: YES!
08,01Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: gun silencer
found the lyra puppet comic I first found out about the whole fiasco
Om: We can try. :)
08,01hahaha

icybeauti: They7 don't watch it. Time for me to see if I can get em to watch ponies. :)
*They
GilDash: You are always ready for everything arent cha?
Ponies47: If they do, give them the welcome wagon.
08,01also, i'm seriously considering getting a pair of slippers made: one with lyra's head, one with bonbon's head, on them
icybeauti: Well of coarse! Pinkie Pie's welcome song. :)
Om: Usually. It's how I roll. :)
That'd be so awesome
that Lyra Puppet is the strangest thing to come from bronies
08,01like this, but Lyra and Bon Bon: http://img.alibaba.com/img/pb/798/508/367/367508798_446.jpg
Ponies47: I wish that had been around when I first joined the herd.....
icybeauti: What had been around?
GilDash: Hmm, yes it is. Not always to the point tho xD
Ponies47: The welcome wagon

You know I haven't been keeping up with Jappleack. Last time I look Applejack just captured her. Well time to catch up. :P
Holy Raptor Jesus
...if you can find them right click there name and click open a query
Wrek: I'm taken by this, it's extrodinary. It's very much your work, and I'm impressed with it very much.
And I always wondered how one person could draw all of Castle Crashers too, sheesh
Sorry, watching old streams lol
R-Dash5000: Gilardi is going in weird places with this story :D
Wrek: If I came across as offensive with that previous statement, I'm sorry.
8,6./msg
*shrugs* I'll never be good at anything. Still a blank flank I guess at heart.
05i was jsut suprised by your reaction :P
05people have been so quiet tonight so yeah xD
thanks
Wrek chat has been quiet?
Don't be like that flutter_spin :(
/me is enjoying the stream too much to talk
/me dances
Where did this chat box thingy come from?
ehhhh. I made my story revolve around me. It hits me home at heart
Wrek: Fair enough :). I'm just so use to being amazed by your art, and to see this piece, which has that 3D effect, just goes to show the talent you have.
Barbetos: From the Unknown
Wrek: There's a reason my dA signature says "you artists make me so jelous."
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG ... We must kill it with fire then. o_o
Sort of became this 'I am what I need to be' type of cutie mark
Barbetos: mmmhmmm
jack of all trades, eh?
G'night everypony! :)
any fallout fan here?
I guess its because I work in a pizza place and my family doesn't like that at all.
08,01flutter_spin: they don't like pizza?
i am sad
00,03Aren't we all Fallout fans?
/me hugs GilDash
night GilDash
08,01i've never played Fallout
^
lol. They just hate that I'm in a sense 'throwing my life away for min wage'
Scoot-Scootaloo: i mean the game not the fic =/
GilDash: You sleepin
I've never played Fallout
08,01flutter_spin: well... why are you throwing your life away for minimum wage?
00,03I meant the game too! I never read the fic! :D
Om: Aye. I sleep, unlike some ponies. :)
GilDash: Boooooooring >_<
hmmm
uhhhhh. Because the first time I looked for a job was in August 2008, the exact month the US market crashed
Scoot-Scootaloo don't you do fan fic readings?
08,01ah
For the weak. For the weak.
08,01flutter_spin: well, what qualifications do you have?
00,03Yeah, I just never got around it

not much lol
Scoot-Scootaloo: ikr
Om: In that case I'll be sure to rock your world tomorrow. ;)

That's correct! Great job Skylands! You now have 4125 Points.
GilDash: I'll try and be nice and dead tired on your return. xD
Scoot-Scootalo Oh I was just confused, not trying to step on your toes or anything. =P
sagas: I'm going now. See you tomorrow. :)
08,01flutter_spin: even professional qualifications are enough to get your foot in the door of a good career path
bye GilDash! see you then!
Om: Get some sleep. I'll be freaking peeved otherwise. :|
sagas: See ya. ;)
Well it was much worse. Even Dominos wouldn't hire me because they wanted '6 months previously work-related driving experience'
GilDash: I cant promise anything~
:)
Om, she wants you to sleep too. lol
I'm not making that up.
08,01flutter_spin: i dunno if computers are your thing, but if they are, i'd recommend something like a Cisco certification
/me is not really laughinh
Ninjazz: I'll consider it xD
08,01but that's just an example
Om: THE MAN SAID SLEEP! :[
Yeah, I tried that. 2 years of Votech in Computer Networking
08,01flutter_spin: how'd that go?

I'm good at art, but I don't have the patience for it... really
No, my 2pm.
But I wrote my fanfic, so whatever :P
08,01for those who don't know: Wrek is currently drawing the exclusive t-shirt design for holders of BUCK's sponsor tickets
Ninjazz: We know. That's why I'm trying to help you make it your 10 PM again.

Ninjazz: oh well... nothing

Irish_Pony: Fair enough, really. :D
Irish_Pony: Now I'm tempted to see if there's any valitidy to all this Gamer Luna talk.
I guess I had enough fun here. Maybe I'll back and finish Black Ops before I return it to my cous.
GilDash: There isn't. Its a myth forget it happend
Om: Pssh. Not likely. :p
GilDash: if i ever went to china with long hair i would get attacked by people there since exotic or uncommon hair is considered interesting :D
GilDash: I have no idea :P

killerpony7733: Oh yeah! :)
So GilDash became a "it" because he won't tell her sex properly? :D

MadSurge,more like Gildash plays what gender it wants.
MadSurge: Its an it, cuse that is what it is.
Ponies47: level 3 force grip that rocked socks so fun to throw a enemy to their death
WallDives: pretty much :D
MadSurge, I refer to his OC most times just because of his motherly nature to me and well... I like mares.
Odd.

I call everyone a "he" until told otherwise :D
Lol Shizuka
Ponies47: jedi academy?

Shizuka: :D
Shizuka: MASTER TROLL :D
11,01Shizuka: Lol.
MadSurge: Same.
killerpony7733: Yeah. I have never played it because I suck at video games so I really don't play em. :$
Right now, I would post a chat log, but I don't have any funny ones.
Om, being open.
08,01so my hair is pretty much dry now: http://imgur.com/FlZEJ
OMGOMGOMGOMGOMG my replacement Powerup rewards card just came in the mail! I'M SO HAPPY TODAY
Just a few pointless ones and the one where I had a conversation with Discord.
Ninjazz: Ookay. Fiar enough, I like pumpkins cuse they please me.
Pinkies4thWall: Huzzah!
Ponies47: Jedi Academy was a very superior version of the outcast series i mean it does have little less important character that drives it but the fact you can level up either dark or light side powers and will eventually get the choice of choosing light saber styles or types like dual sabers or double edged saber made it so great
mmmmmm pumpkins :P
Sorry for that wall text :D
08,01heh, when i have it tied back in a rather aptly named ponytail, it *really* does look like pinkie's tail
I like trains
Also, nightowl3090 is almost done with his stuff, so hopefully i'll have a Pinkie Pie controller soon!
trains dislike me
killerpony7733: Wow. That sounds awesome O_o
/me gives Om a pumpkin

Ponies47: damn right it is :) both light saber types you could go with has their own strengths and weaknesses ;)
killerpony7733: (squee) O_o
Ninjazz: Now cook it into a pie!
I feel like I've seen this drawing somewhere before... deja vu
pumpkin pie is awesome.
/me misses Gamer_Luna too much :'(
Ponies47: oddly the most diverse light saber type was one due to the ability to choose inbetween all light saber fighting styles light/medium/haevy
13http://i.imgur.com/IaQzN.gif
killerpony7733: I see.
Irish_Pony: Gamer_Luna gets on randomly so you may catch her
WallDives: One of the best pie
Shizuka: I wish I was that man
Irish_Pony: She will be on eventually.
killerpony7733: but...I WANT HER NAOW!!! :'(
Shizuka: haha
Irish_Pony: then i'll cross my fingers for her to appear out of the thin air ;)

Ponies47: and i would like to have long hair but he gets me pisst off when he cuts it
I might dye my hair rainbow in the future, for obvious reasons
Chains: Now im confused. You said he wasnt dead
sagas: I was trolling.

Paraspriting*

Chains: oh carry on then

cow334: I'm scared to tell my dad. But ponies have been trying to help me over come my fear, But what can you say. Haters gonna hate. Just carry on with life and if poeple say what they think ognore em. :)
killerpony7733: I was wondering what you were getting at there

sagas not too bad, enough to be annoying. I had been burnt badly before, so this is nothing
Chains: i know i know im sorry about thhat
*ignore
Biglaw: Same here
cow334: You spelled that wrong.
sagas very very bad typo but nvm the whole message as you said something a bit before which i didn't notice till i send it

Chains: Why?
Chains: -no comment-
why?
Chains: i don't like derpy ethier to tell you the truth she can get me mad some times
derp a derp
08,01hey, he's entitled to his opinion
cow334: why? how?
sagas: Back when I was a vault designer for the princess, she was my assistant.
I know, it's free speech. I'm just a tad bit shocked as all....
08,01sagas: true, nothing wrong with that
sagas: She ALWAYS got in the way.
sagas: well it's not that i dont liike her it is just that
Chains: Oh Fallout Equestria
she is WAY OVER POPULATED
sagas: I'm not talking about that!
cow334: Over populated?
???
cow334: Because she symbolizes how the people who make the show connect to the bronies.
sagas what a funny wrong use of words :D
sagas: hmm let me find the word for it
I used to not get what the hype was about her (Derpy), but someone learned me, and now she's in top 5
Hi everypony
cow334: too popular?
She symbolizes the fandoms influence on the show
killerpony7733: no
Pinkies4thWall: Same. I just thought "weird eyes" at first, but I got it.
hey Sonic_Rainboom
Hey, sonic_Rainboom
cow334: mainstream?
icybeauti:
now i <3 Derpy with all my soul
icybeauti: sorry meant no not cause of that
hai
Derpy is boss
She was nopony in the beginning and we got her all the way up to getting her own cannon name and voice
cow334: Then why? Is it because she destroyed town hall? Or the chan- nevermind.
hi epichsagea
icybeauti: no
Hey, epichsagea
YEAH DERPY IS BOSS

killerpony7733: It a happens
cow334: Or when she dropped the mail on twilight?
.... *facehoof*
is it possible to get a seizure from audio patterns
?
cow334: Because the fandom uses/likes her too much?
icybeauti: haha that is funny but no
Thanks sagas :)
Pinkies4thWall: Go watch porygon and get back to me on that.
cow334: in so many*
Pinkies4thWall: only one way to find out
sagas: EXACTLY
Ponies47: Always :)
cow334: Then why does she anger you?

MahBoi777: i'm trying REALLY HARD right now

Wrek: make the baground all the colours!!!!
killerpony7733: nope
He said always?

*Noms on barbecue flavored porato chips*
cow334: Well its understandable why we like her so much. Like I said she represents what the fandom has accomplished in affecting the show

DAT C&C
yeah C&C
8,6www.bronystate.net/rules
It stands for Brony UK Convention, but that would be BUKC.

But i enjoy using caps every now and again...
RA2 opening theme :O
Hellmarch is my kind of march
08,01killerpony7733: it's only available to BUCK attendees with 20% Cooler tickets
MahBoi777: i think i'm probably temporarily a little deaf now, though. been listening to headphones playing at about 90-100 Db for about 20 straight minutes
kk
icybeauti: it's ok to use it OCASIONALLY!
cow334: Overused I guess, vut she is our crowning accomplishment in terms of influencing the show
I would buy this
08,01(http://www.bronyuk.org)
sorry
cow334: *but
DeathStar: I know. You just can't use the royal voice ALL THE GODMODDING TIME!
08,01Chains: it's BUCK
Pinkies4thWall: okay, so we know it causes u to become deaf
sagas: i guess ehh
The acranem should be BUKC.
b.u.c.k
/me takes notes
It's spelled wrong.
08,01Chains: probably not
just to be really brand concious and completely cover myself in the BUCK oc
icybeauti: because that WOULD GET annoying
no seizures yet
CBUK
sagas: she is awesome but i think she gets over used
Pinkies4thWall: do u feel anything else?
DeathStar: Of course.
08,01Chrysalis: acronym, and it looked nicer as BUCK
Right now, in says "Brony United Convention Kingdom"
cow334: alright fair enough
08,01sagas: eeyup
MahBoi777: my whole head is feeling bass hits
Bronies United Kingdom Convention
Nice
MY
or B.U.K.C.
WHIOLE
sagas: and the fact that like almost
HEAD
08,01Chains: no, it says Brony UK Convention, and it's shortened to BUCK
otakon: That would be BUKC!
omfg he has to the backround? ffs
pronounced Buck
*whole
When's the convention?
Pinkies4thWall: VERY interesting
08,01Chrysalis: i meant that at chains
Chains: yeah but PRONOUNCED buck
Who cares? The shirt looks buckmazing and it probably took hours to make.
08,01AJIsAwesome: August 18th and 19th in Manchester
otakon: But written BUKC.
cow334: almost what?
Sweet!
Chains: yeah
I'm a grammar nazi. I do not approve of BUCK.
Pinkies4thWall: have you started puking rainbows yet?
Give him time.
on the other hand, i'm killing my headphones' battery at a killer rate
sagas: PEOPLE think they can talk exatly like derpy just because they can make THERE VOICE SOUND LIKE THEY ARE RETARDS
That pony looks like a Sea Pony
8,6you're a troll and you whine a lot
BuCk
MahBoi777: have you seen the shirt?
Who?
ohai kirzstryfe!
Wait, is it Brony United Cingdom Konvention?
kirzstryfe: me?
...
I unerstand the rage you have grammar nazis because i am one myself, but wouldn't Bukc look a little weird?
Pinkies4thWall: lol yes
Because, if it was, I'd shut up.
icybeauti: yes.
08,01okay, i want to clear something up here: It's Brony UK Convention, but it's shortened to BUCK. It's not an acronym, it's a modification. It used to be an acronym, until Derpy swapped the letters around.
Man, whenever I type in this place, I typo like hell :P
cow334: Well she is taken to be clumsey/ditzey. Thats just how the fandom has characterized her
08,01and it's now stuck like that
OH GOD
sagas: eh i guess
Not save derpy
Derpy!!!!
Oh crud....
kirzstryfe: i am a troll?
I'm
Celestia save the Queen! Wait....
08,01Chains: this happened a while ago
save derpy can make people cry if they have sensitive dispositions
dont stuff it in your face
dont stuff it in your mouth
Chains: you can't take a joke?
08,01Chains: yes, he wrote it because that's what it's called. it's called that because of Derpy
sagas: yeah

08,01Chains: okay. let's go through this again. about 6 months ago, I decided to start a convention. when deciding on a name, Brony UK Convention was decided upon, which was shortened to BUKC, but then Derpy changed the letters round to BUCK, and it stuck
Panda-: Know that feel
08,01so now that's what we're called
