MY LITTLE PONY!
'Night all.
Dat's a Creamy Dream

Cream dream... is that supposed to imply a wet dream?
Her problem is she assumes too much responsibility
'Ice cream dream' = wet dream?
I'd give rarity ice cream... if she didn't mind, that is
/me headdesks
And ice cream makes it all complete
Twilight is the cause of her own problems. That's all there is too it.

You do realize that Pinkie Pie's item placements totally break the aesop of this episode. Because she was prepared for emergencies that even WITH her Pinkie Sense, she couldn't have possibly predicted.
Gypsy magic is canon
I'll cook up a solution with the knowledge I've accrued

Time travel in Equestria follows the 12 Monkeys Rule of time travel

1,11To EVVVERRRYONE trying to figure out the "beginning" of this time loop, I have a nice quote from Harry Potter's own Luna Lovegood: "A circle has no beginning."
did spike died?
Poor Future spike
Lesson, don't eat ice cream for 24 hours straight
HA, Serves you right Spike!
the future is not yet set.....
and then Spike died of a burst appendix
00,03Spike's logic is flawed...
he ded
It begins at its tangent
future spike is worst spike
aww its over :(
Pinkie is clearly Twilight's very best friend of all.

Someone here plays the multiplayer
I don't, kept having issues with it

11,01Dunno how to enable it right now, which is bad.
device manager?
13recording devices, properties, use this device probably
11,01No. It's free right now.
11,01Shizuka: Tried that.
Okay, enough of this damn heat, I'm turning on the AC
what's free?
I like free.
paladin, i've not stopped using my AC since.. early april =/
I think it would be a good idea to bring some greater awareness of Magicka while it's on sale.
11,01I don't switch between port.

00,10that intro was not song it was just bad noise that eventaly became song. once it was all song it was good.
11,01My sound settings are messed up.
00,10the intro was painfull
11,01My speakers won't function now.
0,14is that Tool?
11,01Yes.
11,01I hate that I have technical difficulties half the time I stream.
dat bad luck
Do you think you might consider doing some Magicka?
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/31089/The-Three-Sisters ... too bad its a sad fic. I don't like them
11,01Can someone help me. I used to never have this problem.
Never learned how to stream. Can't help ya
11,016+ years
Maybe its just dying
11,01Not sure if it's dying.

My response? "Because I could."
Because ponies, thats why!
We're hearing more music. You?
Oh, this intro again
11,01I might cut stream due to tech difficulties.
Oh, it's Virtual Audio Cable.
AlejandroMoist: HA HA HA HA STAYIN ALIVE~ STAYING ALIVE~

11,01No sound.
She didn't mind.
11,01I'm not.

11,01No.
That's the crazy thing about it.
lol
Everyone refresh
11,01It's transmitting sound, but it's not sending anything to my speakers.
lol
Hm.
It. Is a mystery.
/me strokes moustache
Maybe it's a problem with the speakers or the connection
Clearly, a beaver has stolen the input cable
A beaver? Nitt's Canadian now?
And a very large tail.
But why would the beavers target us?
11,01There are beavers in Pennsylvania.
Right the first time.
where are the my little beaver plushies
because we cannot conjugate the verb forsake!
There are beavers in my state as well

You don't need to know how to play!
08,01if i could draw, i'd draw my OC with a penguin, telling it "i wish i could quit you"
no
Add a crapton of solid-fuel boosters, and screw with the pitch/yaw/etc.

I remember seeing Zombieland in the theaters when it came out. It was nice
I never get picked..... *sad face*
Saturn: i petition a reroll tomorrow
LOL, I wasn't too far off! :$
That's why we need lottery WEEK
08,01it was chosen fair and square
08,01it's a song
08,01imagine it being played on acoustic guitar and cello
Saturn do you still have movie picks?
i.e the movies everyone picked?
do you guys still have the list
08,01somewhere

If we pretend that ponies can be ridden by humans, Saturn, then Rarity would be most comfortable to ride, because she would be wearing a comfortable saddle.

00,02Nittany_Discord, DO IT AGAIN!
I THINK MAYBE THERE WAS A PROBLEM
Nittany, WINGS ON BOTTOM
I was going to make a 9/11 joke about this, but then I realized it was plane wrong.
WINGS man
move em down
I think maybe - just maybe - you need more control surfaces. For, yknow, control.
now put wings on the bottom
Now more rockets on those
needs no wings
Not enough wings
....
too much
and HAI GUYS
Whats is called
