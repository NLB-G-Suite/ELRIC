SB looks like someone who could be in the Guiness book of records for giving hugs.
Well, he's probably one of the youngest mods on the site, so that makes sense
AJ: Your initials are that of Applejack. You will probably get pinged hard.
Bjornfot: How tall is he?

ScootaChicken:
We're on the second movie.
"It's now very common to hear people say 'I'm rather offended by that.' As if that gives them certain rights; it's actually nothing more...it's simply a whine. 'I find that offensive,' It has no meaning, it has no purpose, it has no reason to be respected as a phrase. 'I am offended by that,' Well so fucking what?" -Stephen Fry

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Dexter Heyman (Rowan Atkinson)'s final scene is a reference to many Warner Bros. "Coyote & Road Runner" cartoons, where the Coyote would always end up falling into an abyss and leaving a dust cloud upon impacting on the ground.

Night everypony. Sun is dawning And I need my sleep.

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: At the very end of the credits you can hear a voice speaking backwards. The voice is that of David Wohl, saying in reverse, "His boat has been demolished," a line heard earlier in the film.
We need more good comedies

Bye, Gumri
This is my pick for the Tom awards
The_Si: Like history...
cider/cider
1,11I actually enjoyed that much more than any of the "___ Movie" series.
04Eh, 7.5/10 Too many references for my blood, the Epic Movie of the 90's but still better than Epic Movie
Meanwhile, I am dead
Rating equal to Robocop/10

MFW you saide that, Midnight_Fyre
And so is your wife
8/10
StinkomanFan: Oh ok then.

I was conflicted between the first and this one
later Gumri
Ghosties: Sorry, but Epic Movie has nothing on that
both are good imo
welp I'm out goodnight guys wub you all :)
secret of the crying game lulz
1,11Hell, I almost liked it more than Evil Dead. >.>
I may actually try to watch both movies again later.
bloodiest movie ever/10
They're on Double secret probation
Om: to each their own then
It was funny but personally I thought Airplane, Blazzing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, even Deathstalker 2 funnier.
THIS IS GOTTA BE THE NEXT BEST MOVIE PICK FOR THE NEXT BRONYSTATE GALA
Emphasise may
this movie was intelligently written for a comedy movie... this is why i miss 80's and early 90's comedies
Your wife was eaten by your dog
Acheron187: the norm troller isnt here...either way ponies are indeed next
WHAT was the title again i forgot
04Better than Evil Dead 1? Understandable
I liked this as much as Top Secret
sagas: Indeed.
04Better than Evil Dead 2? HA HA HA HA HA HA
I agree with you, though, Ghosties, pop references just don't make for good comedy.
Ghosties: IKR
Be seeing ya Bronies bye!
04My sides
no i ment that ponies is after this
1,11@ghosties: No, better than evil Dead 2
NOW WE MUST WATCH THE 1st ONE!
04My sides
Ah.
Shamroc: awesome
Spectrum_Rush|WON: Hot shots: part deux
04You make me laugh
So many people going to bed.

sounds like the start to an excellent Choose Your Own Adventure , StinkomanFan
sagas: The first one isn't as good
3Answer to tonight's scrambled movie title? What's that mean?
RyunosukeKnT: danke:)
04Implying there is any better B movie than Evil Dead 2
Calcos323: I disagree
Hey there everypony! Aww, I missed the movie...
Answers to tonight movie scramble T-2 clever
Biglaw: lol
I was wondering if anyone else noticed that. I never have...
I've only been up for...hm...18 hours now. Not done yet.
otakon: Maybe if you replaced next doors batteries.
I should make one of those things
Biglaw: It was a good one
sagas: Understandable. They're both amazing
HELLO EVERYPONY! :)
SlurryMoon: it's a very short title.
hello
sagas: And the first one DOES have Cary Elwes
har har
Reikim: Good man. Sleep is for the weak afterall
/me crash glomps Ponies47
Howdy Ponies47!
Evil Dead 2 is a classic. This is a strong movie, but like Ghosties said, it's not quite as original.
Hey hey hey Ponies47!
Dat amazing OST
this was indeed better than evil dead 2
all girl middle name are Rodham
oin the order that you should know thier names
hai Ponies47
I like writing how people die in hilarious and original ways
hey Ponies47
hello Ponies47 , choose a name that doesn't begin with pon
Calcos323. So this is one of the RARE CASES, where the SEQUEL beats the ORIGINAL????? AWESOME!!!!!!
04Right, Hot Shots Part Deux or whatever isn't very original
StinkomanFan: Okay then. So how would our resident flaming dwarf die?
ello Ponies47
04It's just one giant parody
darwin awards fan, StinkomanFan ?
whoa.. wait... Bob Vila was Bob Vila? no wai...
If not the first one, can we watch Airplane!?
I'm a tad bit sad, because Amnesia keeps crashing on launch :(, but I WILL play Limbo!
1,11COMING UP NEXT: MY LITTLE PONY, IT'S ABOUT TIME! STAY TUNED.
Dark92Enigma: Correct
fluttercry: It was shown a while ago, just a funny B movie that knew it was a B movie.
This is one amazing OST.
nuns not in this movie
nuns NOT in the movie
Flaming Dwarf?
wait, did that bguy with all the hopes and dreams end up dying? I missed it if he did
Its a very funny parody at least
Nuns not in this movie
Ghosties: thats not true, many jokes were original.
Ponies? *stays*
Hall or Nothing
Midnight_Fyre: no ryan did not end up dieng
StinkomanFan: otakon.

inb4 Twilight goes crazy. AGAIN.
Mmm

Clopping
fluttercry that was an oxymoron
Spike now I need icecream. What an ass
Oh god... Twilight...breaking...so...badly.
CLOP CLOP CLOP
Twilight needs to stop clopping
Reikim: i like it

Winter Wrap-up!
I love love love this episode! :)

That was Spike's first wet dream Twilight!

Twilight clops at 3 am
He carries that clock with him?
I love how Twi teleports randomly when she's freaking out.
arbor day
11,01It's a 4!
oh no, Twilight is clopping in the middle of the night again
00,03An hour until she loses control of her ife :$
Now canon

How tragic
Arbor Day in Equestria = Canon

IT'S JULY FORTH
SCHEDUALCEPTION
Why is she meeting with the hay board?
Sumica, during the scene where Twilight infiltrates the library, can you play something from the MGS soundtrack?
StinkomanFan: Now I'm thinking about how that dream would have continued and gah
I hate waking up from nice cream dreams.
owlicous IN SOVIET RUSSIA, THE MOVIE CHOOSES YOU!
What a crisis
1,5
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Wakking up in the night hearing your sister/friend clopping . poor spike
Only Twilight would worry about this. Not able to schedule another schedule in this months schedule.
Dat Ice cream
dat cream dream
a cream dream?
I'm out.
Ice Cream :3
MY LITTLE PONY!
'Night all.
o god why?
Night RanYakumo!
Dat's a Creamy Dream
Night night RanYakumo.
A nice cream dream :p
Cream dream... is that supposed to imply a wet dream?
Her problem is she assumes too much responsibility
Stupid sexy cream dream
Cream dreams, if you know what i mean
'Ice cream dream' = wet dream?
11,01Did Sumica silence his pings?
StinkomanFan: /)
I'd give rarity ice cream... if she didn't mind, that is
/me headdesks
And ice cream makes it all complete
/me hits Ponies47 with a newspaper
Twilight is the cause of her own problems. That's all there is too it.
(\ AJ
Sumica did. That is sad
FRIEEEEEEEENDDDDDDDDDDDSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!
I said hai!
FRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANCE!!!!!!
Scootaloooo
That...just happened.
Fraaaaannnnccceee
1,11Many jokes were original, and while the references aren't, the jokes made with those references ARE original and, to give my honest opinion, more entertaining as a whole than what Evil Dead 2 was.
She's not an elected official or a business leader.
Nittany_Discord: yus
And then everypony had sex
gotta schedual time to schedual the making of scheduals so you can follow your schedual
Can't say I caught that the first time around.
Scootaloo has a good crowing voice
Now, as I was saying
Hai ponibas
05,15and then RX-78-SweetieBot got kicked by a bot
Twilight...take a breather, please.
wait a minute, did i missed the movies
Yo dawg I head you like reading...
I said hey!
put on Snuggle comercial?
Otakon would die at the hand of his own anger

Ghosties: A dance number with furniture?
Alister: Yeah, sure
THE FUTURE!
04Produce an authentic hybrid between horror and comedy
"What happened Future/twilight, did we became assholes or something?"

I guess that's true too.
did i miss the lottery again
/me 1,5noms
first episode i chose!
ponibas: I CAN SEE YOUR TROLLING BULL(SQUEE) :[
[B]JRP2234: probably
And a predestination paradox is born.

Reikim: Fine , Just been hanging out here since yesterday.
Meanwhile: my eyes
oh go
UGGGHHH
Purple.
*goes in fetal position* ...FUUUUTUUURREE...... FUUUTURRE....
Anyone else notice that there's something like three different episodes where the day mentioned is Tuesday?
just you Ponies47 =p

Painful fluttercry
fluttercry: it hurts my eyes.
Dun dun duuuunnn
05,15I'm actually looking for a new combo. red and grey is boring
fluttercry: Looks nice on my client.
The two would end up fighting into the mod's room
Ghosties: did i miss the lottery
Whatever you do dont drop the soap
ponibas: :|
11,01FUUUUUUUTURRRRE.
omg
Tuesday is an inherently funny day.

04Yes, JRP
TS needs to catch up on her common time travel plots >_>
TWILIGHT UR SO CUTE
Mozdoc: rule of three
when did Twilight become Rarity =/
See you next Tuesday...
The party don't start till I walk in
I dont want you to worry about the future, so i go back in time to worry you
Poor Doormat
Poor Fluttershy :(
inb4 paradox
It seems like cats :3
dat doormat
WE CAN SEE THE FUTURE
lol
but the baloons have a lot of drag!
Doctor Whooves laughs at your temporal paradox.
/me 12,4 what?
Even the doctor laughs
11,01Berry Punch tastes awesome.
Alister: Yes, although the sum total of that experience is debatable depending on who you're asking.
Holy crap that actually works.
Oh there were still plenty of original and good jokes, though.
05,15Stop with the colors!
Once otakon and Meanwhile fall into the room where only Mods may live
Doctor whooves keeps a straight face
You should sort that out.
Doctor Hooves, why you laugh?
haw haw
Reikim: I don't get it
and this is why no one believes her in the wedding episodes
huh?
fluttercry: Try pink and yellow.
Eh?
They would instantly turn to dust
lol
Dr. Whooves laughs because he knows you can't cross your own time stream.
NO MORE COLORS!
:D
Pinkie Pie just made a METALLICA reference! <--------
Berry Punch laughs in the face of death
Twilight's urgent message: I shot an elephant in my pajamas! How he got in my pajamas, I have no idea!
ALL the colors!
DocSane: timey wimey 6_9
dshannon: that makes so much freaking sense
Ghosties: can i have the winners
cuz she's wasted
Everlasting_Joy: Yes you can
/me 12,4 a few more colours.
*RUNS FOR LIFE*
Sorry.
lol
And don't inform the princess or anything.
lol
05,15No more colors...srs
sagas: I know, I'm just having some Dr. Who fun.
Ruuun to the hiiiiiiiiiils!
no, crossing time streams leads to disaster
0,14ow
Srs face. :I
I was writing your creative death otakon
Sometimes you can, sometimes you can't
Alister: It means that exactly how much experience I have depends on which of my friends you ask, and what topic. Shoot your questions anyway, if I screw up then the rest of manechat will help.
join in the panic
1,11AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!
fluttercry is srs, post Fluttershy

*Joins Pinkie in Panic*
Everlasting_Joy: But that was never said in Doctor Who...
:(
Applejack is best Mason.
:(
1,11in the long run, this is probably a very, very good thing.
eeyup
how does one simply wipe concrete out of their mane?
11,01Hooray for clean energy.
And no pony had to build faraday cages because they don't have any electronics.
sagas, yes it has been.
StinkomanFan: Make sure otakon is dressed as a French knight
Or draw fluttershy <_< >_>
eeyup
So if she can teleport any time,why didnt she teloported into the future?
Reikim: ok Bronysith already convinced me to confess , but the problem is that I think my best friend loves the same girl as me
And all of Ponyville's infrastructure was fixed, so the effort wasn't wasted at all.
But it was a draw
bad mane day, averted
both of them died
a french knight?
:p
Everlasting_Joy: But they do cross their time streams. I remember it happening
what disaster was that I wonder...
/me suddenly getting really tired
Kandarihu: you could probably make a faraday cage out of scootaloo wire
Hello Philidelphia :)
SunderlandPony89: make sure he's white as snow.
Las Pegasus... really? xD
Los Pegasus.
sagas: Yes, they do it, but they try to avoid it because of a paradox.
Fillydelphia!
Pinkie Pie said ''RUN FOR YOUR LIVES'' Opening for RUN TO THE HILLS
Found it!
Las Pegasus :D
Yep, the west coast now gets a pony city.
Las Pegasus
ZUUL MUTHERFUCKER!
Alister: Oh man this is going to be awkward. I mean, stereotypical sitcom drama and all, but there are some things that TV doesn't lie (too much) about.
Alright, next request!
where did scroll go D:
Hollar at Fillydelphia (my hometown)
Meanwhile: Good to know someone's getting it :P
04So then it's like the Mortal Kombat 2011 game

They aren't following Pinkie

Reikim: what do you mean by like a sitcom ?
inb4 kratos is now pony canon
0.0
Alister: Although it could probably be solved cleanly if you're lucky and smart.
She thinks it's great that Ponyville will be destroyed
the tail
Everlasting_Joy: I know, but I remember them doing it when Amy got caught in the alternate time stream and she met herself 40 years later
Fluttershy was overpowered this season. Did she get an accessory to speed up her experience gain or something?
Fluttershy: baestmaster

O NO NO NO NO NO! :O
Looking up Isee that my cabinet full of pony toys is collapsing
05,1510,5 How does this look?
DUN DUN DUUUNNN!
COMING (on me)
Twilight is Scarface
fluttercry: Like a melon in a mud puddle.
fairly hard to see
according to her reflection her cut changes sides
you cannot change the future, you can only alter the course of events leading up to the future
sagas, like I said, they try to avoid it, but in that case, present Amy was unconsious, so she couldn't do a thing to future Amy, and they wanted to save present Amy to annihilate future Amy.
Twilight needs to be sedated.
No, they're above the gates of "Hel" (proper spelling
DANG SCAR YOU SCARY! :o
YOUR TIMMY TURNER IS HOWING TWI!
Reikim: unfortunatlely , he's not online so I can't sort it out with him
Where have I seen that groove?
I love when Twilight says "We don't have time for..."

It falls onto me

INB4 RAPE
Scarface Sparkle? ..... Hello to my little Pony!!! *fires twilight gun*
1,11Pinkie's random item placements seem strange, but considering she's lived with her twitches for a while, it makes sense that she is prepared for them no matter what.
DAMN MY KEYBOARD
Flawless logic.
twilight foolishly ignored the cut and later died of gangrene.
pwong
Stiff as a board.
spike will now have his way with you
I'm killed by the very thing I love
Get some Spike
fluttercry: not bad
oh god
fluttercry: It's ok. Kinda like the red though
FUUUU*yay*UUUUUU

Everlasting_Joy: Amy wasnt unconcious
Twilight has a Scrooge McDuck pacing spot
inb4 spike misbehaviour
Alister: Better to do this in person. One thing that's always true: personal situations are always best resolved in person.
quantum theory: looking at the future changes it
Spike , I am Dissapoint
StinkomanFan: hoist by your own petard?
Limbo won't work!!!!
AAAHHHH

But that collapse is future Stinko's problem!
Night night Aeina.

DAMN!
Baltimare.

Baltimare
And then she gets visited by a young alternative version of her mother who is actually 400 years in the future from the alt universe's timeline, which she spawned shortly after creating her parents in that universe with paradox slime.
Silverscreen: Just what I was thinking :)
Silverscreen: dat .mov
future spike look out!
fluttercry: Like mud in a melon puddle.
fluttercry: Try white text and blue background

eek
Dash Sounds different for some reason
WHAT A GOOF.
but now I AM future spike
Alister: On an unrelated note, I think you asked for some of my art once?
05,15So, keep the one I have now then?
what trolls
Reikim: Well , I pretty much only see him in high school since we live in different towns. In school there's this really annoying douche who finds funny to spred my secrets around
MOUSES? I HATE MOUSES!!!!!!
And that's why RD is the best
ouch
Oh, burn!
Reikim: yeah have you uoploaded it ?
yes

I REALLY LIKE HER MANE!
That is a shade of red I didn't know existed.
Meanwhile, stop imitating Deadpool
Ponies47: get adblock
and one for Meanwhile and the ScootaChicken
Gypsy
1,11She's rockin' that 80's groupie look
Alister: Ouch on that first bet, yes on the second. It's a rough sketch I threw together for a friend the other day. Should probably ink in the outline, but I feel lazy.
Twilight: you don't have the power to change the future
You will never be that cool
Pale_Horse TIME TRAVEL FTW
I recommend Adblock Plus. It's out for Firefox and Chrome!
Alister: http://tinypic.com/r/f9r504/6
madam pinkie
Should of been Whooves
FlareChaser|Diablo3 what ?
You do realize that Pinkie Pie's item placements totally break the aesop of this episode. Because she was prepared for emergencies that even WITH her Pinkie Sense, she couldn't have possibly predicted.
Gypsy magic is canon
I was going for white text on blue background.
I'll cook up a solution with the knowledge I've accrued
and then she became snake plinket
ah. Yes, Gypsy magic.
Idk where that red came from.
PINKIE PIE SENSE
ponibas: My computer sucks so hard it won't download it ;(
I trust Pinkie Pies fortune telling
Everlasting_Joy: So future Amy affected past Amy. Altering her own timeline when she chose to save her past self. Eventhough doing so annihalates future Amy, she still affected her own timeline.
:(
they say a kitchen time saves nine, but I'm just saving two
Also, that Firefox pony you guys kept posting. It wasn't until the next day I realized where it came from, derp.
what are the results of the lottery?
.. wow
wait
thats bad
Silverscreen: Cheerilee does the 80s look so much better
pinkie's voice. aawwww :3
you can only see 3 walls in life
You're hardly "Homer Simpson" level of cool at the moment Meanwhile
Reikim: Awesome , you'd get really good if you detailed it more
Pinkie costumes are the best costumes.
Bad Orb! Orb is bad in amnesia!
THE FUTURE
DO THE WALK DO THE TALK
so are we all 4th wall breakers?
Orb is evil!!!
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Diablo 3, me, Bronysithm and you were gonna play :|
Fun Fact: I myself am a time traveller... I travel into the future at a speed of 1 second per second. :D
I've gathered the ingredients to make some time sorbet
StinkomanFan: I don't even know what that means.
That is going to a ep in season 3
Alister: Again, laziness :P would probably help if I also had a tablet.
THE ORB OF CONFUSION

Orb is SATANIC WITCHCRAFT!
there's hardly room for seconds when the seconds melt away

Yay continuality!
/me breaks the rules
1,11Dat genre savvy
fluttercry: that's not bad.
PINKIE, YOU SO RANDOM
SunderlandPony89: why?
sagas: It was Rory who saved present Amy, but Future Amy wasn't annihilated per se, it was the current version was altered to another version because of present Amy being rescued.
SunderlandPony89: Don Quixote and the War of The Worlds?
StinkomanFan: Oh ok then.
Quit! Callibrate the 9 and 3/4 inch catadipotic telescope!
wow. I'm drunk. I'm trying to use linux shortcuts
Should've just said that...

That colour works well but it's a bit offensive.

Stop time, good idea. Freeze everyone in place forever.
*plays metal gear music*

AJ: forever alone.
TAKE MY FATHER
This is NOT a MGS. Why would they reference that movi-- er I mean game. Yeah , because you TOTALLY spend more time playing than watching cutscenes ?
Spike doesn't give a buck

Darf14: This is madness
INB4 META GEAR TWILIGHT

CupcakeWarrior: Same person atm apparently.

Stream's lagging, thus I have switched to work mode.
Acheron187 Madness?!!?!? THIS IS EQUESTRIA!! *kick*
pinkie's bouncing, twilight's sweet moves, spike's ice cream... so perfect
Why are you wearing those? For the bronies!
I do appreciate a woman in spandx
best recon team
00,03That suit must be tight as hell to cover Pinkie's mane..
Should probably do the inking on that drawing I sent to Alister.
Can't she teleport in?
Also, Pinkie Pie wears rubber suits for fun
oh pinkie ^-^
And being Celestia's protoge, I totally have access to the archives, but I forgot about that
I have to admit, that pinkie is pretty cute.
Kinky
IT SOUNDS FUN TO ME
I love it how Pinkie thinks Twi is wanting to find out about her birthday present.
Kinky Pie
close enough
Barbetos: Pinkie is very, very cute.
i want to see princess Luna with spandex...
rationally analyzing Twi at this point is pointless, she's totally lost it
No.
spandex pinkie is best pinkie
Just no.
pinkie looks like catmare
xXxSc0oT4Lo0xXx: eeyup
desertman2: thats not stealthy
04Go Solid Sparkle
Barbetos: /)^3^(\ ikr?
You want that Pinkie plot, dont you StinkomanFan?
04This is a sneaking mission
THIS IS NOT A MGS REFERENCE
/me 11,01is solid
04All weapons are SOP
pretty hard to sneak on hooves
Even the guards are MG stuoid
bounce, bounce
05,15Hah, I've finally made everything black and white on mIRC. Just like the old days
Twilight is a spy! :O
It is something I both fear and desire
European extreme difficuty
I would've really liked it if the BG music was Metal Gear Solid-esque
Future Twilight is hot
GO GO GADGET SOLID METAL GEAR TWILIGHT

!
Shoot, not what I wanted to post
Dammit
"!"
FWAM!
use the tranq gun
Ignore
Everlasting_Joy: I recall future Amy rescuing past Amy, resulting in future Amy not getting to the TARDIS on time before The Doctor locked it. Resulting in future Amy being the reason that present Amy made it on time. I dont know though. That episode was all sorts of timeline paradox mind fucks.
AJ (\
TO THE TARDIS, QUICK!
ALERT: 99
Reikim: you drew taht?
Herro der
LOL
05,15Meanwhile I've thought about doing it, but I just never got around to it
Twilight...TWILIGHT!
AJ: Yeah.

Worst. Guard. Ever.
Wow
There were a lot of outside references in Magicka. Not sure if it's properly used or just thrown in.
INTRUDER ALERT!
Fail guard
UGLYYYYYYYYY
Reikim: noice
Ahem, Present Twilight
You can set it to black and white?
Future Twilight <3
sagas: that made my head hurt

YOU GAVE ME THE UGLLLLLLLLLLYYYYYYYY
PFFFFFT
Magicka is actually on sale on Steam today.
04So I'm guessing
Everlasting_Joy: Future Amy held off the robots while they got on
1,11I...DON'T...KNOW!
stop eatin
fluttercry: Lazy bones.
04It relates to Spike
NO
Twilight becomes TIME COP
04To get Spike to not eat so much ice cream
OH look just Twilight acting weird again... carry on.
damn, harry potter dh2, and hot shots 2 at the same time. ended up missing half of both
Every stallion likes a woman that can dominate them
Pinkie! Use your pinkie sense!
/me sneaks into chat
DR. WHOOVES Y U NO HELP
wat.
PartyCannon: !
sagas: It was, and if you really want to get screwy, wouldn't saving future Amy and leaving present Amy create a paradox?
fluttercry: whats the font that lightIRC uses?
ponibas: Doctor Who: Its seriouse buisness
AWWWWWWWWWWWWW SHIT
StinkomanFan: that i do
04TUESDAY MORNING

DUMBLEDOUGH
oh trolestia, you're such a great pony

ridiculous=badass
Everlasting_Joy: So either way you dont win. This is why I prefer not to think about time travel
RIDDIKULUS
HAHA YEAH YOU DO.

11,01Dumble *explodeS*

Bad aesop here.

Molestia > Trollestia
dat plot
CupcakeWarrior: well yea
owlicious: i mean the game is awesome
How Twilight Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb
oh
argh
Well, we'll see if this is the looped version in a minute.
sagas: It's the reason I like to think of time travel.
Airpuff: Celestia said it first
04OH FUCK
Time travel in Equestria follows the 12 Monkeys Rule of time travel
....
> can only travel back in time once
AND GET A LETTER WITH IT, TWI!
:D
How does she not think this through???
Ahem, Deja Vu
/me is suddenly a french dwarf that is on fire
you are an idiot twilight
Predestination paradox, folks.
Time Paradox :o
TIME LOOP AHOY
> wastes it on warning yourself over nothing
PARADOX!
because she's sleep deprived
twilight gets handed the idiot ball HARD in this ep
owlicious: its like alien breed if you ever played that
stable time loop
DeathStar, right i forgot
RPers. Idek.
04And then Twilight gets stuck in a time paradox
it's a trap!
otakon: and is still thirsty.
reused animation
eeyup
/me is suddenly a monkey with a machete
otakon: You forgot the drunk part.
time paradox
Bootstrap paradox
Ahem, Lazy Animators
otakon: Forgot the badass part
lol
In Twi's defense, she's not exactly thinking clearly at the moment
never played alien breed
IT'S AN AMBUSH, TWILIGHT!
pinkies so good and finding things she must be in hufflepuff (you win ten internets if you get that reference)
Quantum superposition Twilight!
I forgot ALL of the parts
really Om .. i didnt see that o.o
scince+magic...woo
so if she touchs her past self doesn't that mean she'll no longer exist
Let's fae it. Twilight is an Ivory Tower genius. High Intelligence score, only mediocre Wisdom score...
otakon: Also you're french.
Wait Twilight, your not suppose to touch your Future se- *Universe explodes*
Biglaw: How do you know they haven't redrawn it completly ?
otakon: No wait, you got that
He covered that
/me is now kamina
DeathStar Harry Potter reference!
AJ: No you're not.
Alister That, would be pointless
Done FOr
/me is now an octopus
*For
Biglaw: but awesome
Reikim: im not
DeathStar: i just watched that!
Airpuff: Its true. Tusedays are the best by royal decree
Dark92Enigma: not just harrypotter it's something else as well
/me is gurren lagann
On the other hand, I am an octopus
11,01Wah wah waaaaaaaaah
"Why do you look like snake plinkket?"
talk about eyecandy
DeathStar: and i need to rewatch it, i didnt pay enough attention
twilight_sprinkle: relly? awesome
DAT TIME TWIST WILL GO ON FOORRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEVEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRR
talk about eye candy
04....no shit, Twilight
DUH!
TIMEY WIMEY
dat double lesson
Om: i guess >.>
WIBBLY WOBBLY
DeathStar: something about luna lovegood
THE TIME LOOP WILL GO ON FOOOORRRRRRREVEEEEEEEERRR
BUT OK
stuff...
If only
1,11To EVVVERRRYONE trying to figure out the "beginning" of this time loop, I have a nice quote from Harry Potter's own Luna Lovegood: "A circle has no beginning."
Take the Janeway approach to temporal paradoxes. Ignore them.
did spike died?
Everlasting_Joy: Its only a pain when thinking about paradoxs. Otherwise its awesome! If only we knew what would happen if you committed a paradox
DeathStar: yeah it was on tv. but i was watching hot shots 2 and harry potter at the same time, i missed half of each, and it was my first time seeing hp dh2...
Spectrum_Rush|WON: nope
So the lesson is "Don't eat so much ice cream"?
Poor Future spike
Lesson, don't eat ice cream for 24 hours straight
If I ever travel back in time, I'm gonna paradox just to see what the hell happens.
dear princess celestia, today i fucked the space time continium
If I had eight arms, I could manipulate 4 keyboards.
You notice how the 6 break off into pairs for certain episodes. As in they're best freiends within the group?
HA, Serves you right Spike!
the future is not yet set.....
and then Spike died of a burst appendix
00,03Spike's logic is flawed...
Airpuff: Don't look at me. Its the law.
Sumica: mind doing the two hour loop version for Euro Movie Night?
he ded
It begins at its tangent
future spike is worst spike
Next season prediction: They are visited by Starswirl regarding something that is unleashed when the hourglass runs out.
StinkomanFan: nooo
aww its over :(
Then I could have four sock puppets with which to troll.
you can just say that during the big bang the circle was created
Pinkie is clearly Twilight's very best friend of all.
Well who cares about Spike anyway?
DeathStar: something about helga hufflepuff/
StinkomanFan: from icecream headache
11,01Circular time paradoxes do have beginnings.
Om: .. :| The law?
hopefully Limbo shall work on my other computer...
g'night. I'm off to bed
Well, that was fun. But it's almost 5 in the morning.

...is this pony porn
lol
well, imbetween, i like some of the old, all of the legend series, and the second skylanders, the other skylanders was a little bad.
I did not say there are an infinite number of materials. Just always one more than one universe and one less than another
1,11Welp, I'm gonna go kick some ass in Fallout: New Vegas. It was fun, guys. Goodnight.
I wanna see Full Metal Jacket streamed! :P
yeah some of the skylanders are just...ugh

I didn't get a chance to say goodnight to Dances_With_Discord
well, thing is, i never played any of those one's, but i like them because they are conected by a story line, and yes, the right price is key.
what a shame
twilight_sprinkle: Well I gotta get off and head to bed to get up early tomorrow.

This episode is so predictable, but the ending I still get surprised about.
05,15What is this place filled with so many huge links
lol
I love Guyra as much as Lyra 0_0
is it me or did the playlist end
we need bigger links!
Eddmario: eh, it kinda got boring after the third season
You made flutters cry :'(
We get a Daring Do plushie and we give it to Rainbow Dash
And it's actually a camera
StinkomanFan: Her face. It would be adorable.
Eventually I will :P
StinkomanFan: And then you go and ruiin it.
You know where I'm going
fluttercry: I agree :)

08,01Cypresswolf: i would absolutely love to
kirzstryfe: okay i am also doing kinda a RIFFRAX kinda thing where we commentary on the movie, would we be able to shar a stream?
Cypresswolf: same here
Ponies47: Try harder!

BLACK SCREEN IS BLACK, SUMICA. You streaming...
Ponies47: it just takes practice and a bit of learning
Om: *Tries more* Still sucks :(
Actually let's not give Fluttershy a camera plush. Let's listen to TheGreatAndPowerfulT and give her a hug.
Give Spike a Rarit- actually take the camera out of that one
fluttercry: casting its spell that im now under. spammers in the trees and the cute little trollers. rules breaking free and hates with their hating haaaaaaaatiiing
ponibas: True.
05,15Eddmario stop spamming links
08,01Eddmario: yes, very clever. now stop spamming that link.
this is the best part of video, where the black screen stays black
ok, i have one question, what happened to spyro and cynder after spyro saved the earth in dawn of the dragon?
and FYI, sumica isn't answering my texts.. so he might have FDOK'd
StinkomanFan: Silly brony. He's not interested in some plushie! He's only interested in her jewels.
Ponies47: Now keep trying until you have drawn 1000 drawings.
cachi01: DO NOT MENTION THAT SONG AROUND ME AGAIN. I just really don't like So Many Wonders. :(
0,14.....
Ponies47: have you tried tracing things and then moving up from there that's what i did
So, we're watching the first episode of Season 0 then?
StinkomanFan: He wants to eat them.
^
Woodenshy|WINNING: lol y?
And Lyra a Bon-Bon plushie?
Om: *Does 1000 drawings* They still all suck! :(
:D If I could legally wap a six pack with other assorted bottles in the store, I would - not that I haven't tried
cachi01: The second half, OH CELESTIA THE SECOND HALF. The first, slower bit was fine, but...that...UGH.
And Caramel a Big Mac plushie?

Actually, G3 wasn't good, but it wasn't a source of all pain. G 3.5 on the other hoof, was the product of time-traveling Anti-Brony extremists, in an attempt to kill the franchise once and for all, thus causing our community to never exist. Luckily, that guy with the blue box corrected things just enough for Hasbro to pick Lauren Faust instead of Micheal Bay.
You're done. Stop trying.

Sylandest: what? 6_9
/me pulls gun out of Comet's hands and dissassembles it.
I'm telling you, Rarity and Fluttershy's gait ain't normal. (Pinkie Pie need not be adressed, because she's Pinkie Pie.)
I'm Chaotic Brilliant. My opposite is Lawful Stupid.
Comet: NO! just mute it
I can't recall as to why I'm wearing a fedora
i don't understand this
lol
Kencolt: Fluttershy is more of a skip

Reikim: Pinkie or Twilight?

not sure if looping or if I'm going made
Sylandest: :D i guess its beacuse it was movie night :$
RD
Or perhaps Chaotic Neurotic, that works too.

/me is scared O_O......
Bronysith would be Neutral good probably

I am unsure as to what I'd be
Airpuff: oooh, thats right...agh, I missed out!
richfiles: we got ONE episode of Luan, and she was very official
lol
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: wat?
StinkomanFan: Do yuo know where you can find out if your going mad
Hm..
Needs more ponies.
Pony_9001, you're in poni purgatory
Let be just get my banabag
i'm backing up.
Comet: I'm sure there is a test for that online.
Sylandest: Sinner.
otakon: Yeah I loved the Luan episode too

Ohai Sylandest
I'd really prefer a plantain, please.
CupcakeWarrior: howdy!
Nope, still needs more ponies.
Sylandest: Booooo. Tell them no next time.
Luna is a big softie who just wants friends, but has a hard regal shell to crack! :)
And then we all dreamed of poni
otakon, are you sure?
all of us
at once
otakon: Rarity and FLuttershy have the EXACT SAME GAIT. and it ain't something you'll find on any equine.
AD?!?!!?!?!?!?!? :[ :[
Om: I couldn't. The guy I was covering for had a family matter to take care of
And thestral guards! :$
Is this... infinite looping?
what is gait ?
Sylandest: Tell his family no next time.
Kencolt: So who cares again?
Kencolt: MAGICAL TALKING HORSES.

The link isn't for me, I was gonna use a link shortener and trick my anti-brony brother into clicking it
over I think
Kencolt: lol
Sylandest: I m not sure if you even have an OC -lol- so your just a head....and bald -lol-

Joke: Celstia uses Wii and Luna Uses Gamecube <3
StinkomanFan: JJ thinks so
Alister: I'd reply to that, but it's past twelve so I'm liable to start ranting about the nature of humanity.
Gamecube controllers plug into older Wiis
She's like "Sabotage"

Some games let you use them for traditional controls
Iron_Edge: once I get a proper pony persona made, I shall send you the image to use :)

Mish: We have a server?
otakon: I had over $400 freakin dollars! My dad wanted to buy these books to make profit. I was with him but now I'm pissed off at him for talking me into it. WE HAVEN'T EVEN SOLD 1! NOT A SINGLE 1! :[

mish: single player with mods

Alright, thanks for those who filled me in.
00,10mfw people think Nitt has pony vids covered.
Ponies47: well, GODDAMMIT SELL SOME. But don't ask me, I'm broke.
What's LUna do when she's here? She's the only admin I've never really met.
$400 of books? what of.
Nittany_Discord has best laugh, and im not just saying that
pootis for 5 minutes
11,01Sumica: They've never seen my other streams.
Pooooooooooooooootiiiiiiiiiiiiisssssss
Iron_Edge: no, just wanted him to try. I only play single player to practice or.....to use mowds
Mish: ah.
Ponies47: you could have at least gotten a decent PC for that much or at least a servicable one. But don't EVER trust E-machines they suck ass
/me hugs Nittany_Discord
Squee.
You COULD open the request room
Biglaw: pootis spencer here
Ponies47: Patience my young grasshopper
erectin a pootis
To be honest, I don't really keep track of what mods stream...I just know that Val trolls with G3 and rocks with Metalocalypse, Wrek draws saucy ponies, and others kind of just do their thing.
dat winrar
Wrek is an amazing artist :O
otakon: I'm just pissed off at myself for being such an idiot my dad for talking me into it and my computer for you know what :
yea, so how do you feel about the movie's cancelation
:|
I just want to see Escape from Midnight castle played here once
ponibas: For what?
Mish: Have you seen his new AJ drawing?
So this looks fun.
lets play the guess the name game!
Don't care for Val streams. Wrek has interesting tastes in music, but I lack attention to drawing for hours. Sumica streams awesome shows.
Well, this looks interesting
wat?
lolwtf
The hell?
for selling the books
Mish: Wrek is best artist
whut dis
oh god heads
GAA!
What are those!?
What game is this?
yay kerbal space program!!!
Om your worst fears
flutter_shy: Luna had the nostalgia down, but she hasn't streamed in awhile.
I love this game
Ive never heard of this game, what is it?
Games is a good spin on things, but my preference is to writing when it comes to more than 20min of game time
StinkomanFan: Not even close.
I know people will ask questions, so I'll post this link to spare people from explaining: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KerbalSpaceProgram
I Miss Luna
flutter_spin: I can't remember what either of the other two stream, but Wrek streams best music
Nittany_Discord: you might wanna try Pyschonauts. I play it because the comdey and design drives me forward in the gameplay <3
I was really disappointed
hmmmmmmmmm
off to bed.
Could be because it's 0050 EST
night
:D
I say its 'interesting' just because I'm more of an Octavia classics man
get version 0.15.2 its much better than 0.13 because they added two moons! and space planes
Microphone!
sorry guys, I'm really gonna go to bed.
ponibas: I am just freakin pissed of at my dad. I'm such a idiot for buying those dumb books for him :|
Goodnight Wondershy
I was thinking that spyro couldive gone with a big hit
before he made the tf into what he is now
But that never happened :/
I would totally watch a stream of just Nittany dusting things
Nittany_Discord: <3 you, wrek and Superbrony are mah fave mowds

Tell him if he don't sell them soon, you demand he pay you for them.
11,01CupcakeWarrior: In normal clothes?

I then had to rob a pharmacy and get insulin
it was so cute
Smash your mic with a hammer.
who was talking about the Ocarina yesterday?
That's what I do.
Stallion_of_War: So I guess you don't live in Canada.
kerbal space program.
lolwutg
And when I buy the new one to replace it, it works good as new!
Eenope
Stallion_of_War: although I'm not sure...is insulin free in the US?
What is a kerbal?
hell no
03god dang it, I can't get torrent webUI's to work on my server
I don't know; I was making a joke that the Lee Newton pony was so cute it gave me diabeetus
Free prescription drugs? What is this, any other civilized country but the USA?
yea, but skylanders has to many characters to play as, and once you get most of them, you cant decide on who to play as in it.

Nittany_Discord: use duct tape and if it still doesnt work then use more duct tape
See, Drug companies -> Bribe the government
^ Red Gree tech
Red Green I menat
GAHAHHAH! Typos!
lol
Goverment x Bribes
Although I must be honest and say that I'm not entirely sure how diabetics are compensated by the government. Thankfully, I've never been sick in such a way.
jsut go to bed now? they'll only get worse
dammit! they're contagious!
so, game not working?
Twilight! NOOOOO! :$ don't use the illiteracy curse on the rokfdkfdsjjhdf

Scootaloo learning how to fly.
Stupid action is stupid.
Pushed a button to turn my internet off.
lol, nice
I did that before Nit

^
Scootaloo needs to visit Assassin's Creed II Leonardo
flutter_spin: actually it was like 2 hours cause I kept looking up to watch the movie
but I don't have a whole lot of skylanders
It usually takes me 10 hours to draw something and I have to refer to something

Makes me laugh every time I use it.

I've had an odd urge to stream me doing stuff recently. Not that anypony would watch because I can't stream it here... but...
03wtf
03the server is going at like dialup speeds
You could get a livestream account
CupcakeWarrior: in vegas
Oh, is that Nittany_Discord streaming?
I know
03...
03!lag
What's the point of streaming if nopony would watch... NOPONY WHATSOEVER
03ugh
And then I played the exact same game that Nitt is streaming.
I've always wondered about "doing X" but then I usually shrug it off and do something completely unexpected and random
yea, plus, if you have completed the game, all you can really do is run around, and play multiplayer, which is pointless if no one wants to play with you.
Almost as exciting as SuperBrony64's Wii Shop chanel streams! :$ :D
I discovered that BronyState isn't blocked at my school
:3
13why so ping
Shizuka because we wub woo
Someone here plays the multiplayer
11,01I don't know why, but my rear mic jack is disabled.
I don't, kept having issues with it
Biglaw: winning!
use the front...?
11,01Dunno how to enable it right now, which is bad.
I recall my brother telling me he couldn't play with me for a couple months because he had to build an addtion to his house. So instead, I watched ponies. Go figure.
Weird. Giggle at it and maybe the tech ghosties will leave! :O
Nittany_Discord: Did you buy this game?
Biglaw: Neither was it at my middle school. I hope it isn't for highschool either
11,01No. It's free right now.
11,01Shizuka: Tried that.
Okay, enough of this damn heat, I'm turning on the AC
Seapony Lyra plz
Ponies47 Highschool lunches just got 20% cooler
what's free?
So I have no idea what I'm doing but whatever.
I like free.
flutter_spin air?
paladin, i've not stopped using my AC since.. early april =/
Oh hai Dashie! :D is your pal Seapony Lyra here?
Nittany_Discord: I don't know if this helps, but my audio on Win7 is a bit derpy. I have to reset the primary/default audio jack every time I switch between my headphones and the HDMI port. I don't know, but maybe it's something like that for microphones?
I think it would be a good idea to bring some greater awareness of Magicka while it's on sale.
11,01I don't switch between port.
Oh hey there
Building a rocket
like what?
Fun stuff
Too the mOOOOOOOONnnnnannanAAAA
hey there Reikim, and... TO THE MOOOOOOOONNNN!!!!
couldnt connect my portal to the computer properly
Nittany_Discord: Don't underestimate teh power of windows to do random crap
LOL! A window into Tartarus
:$
I saw a "Set as default" thing there
hmmmm
03the frick
hiya Rainbow Dash!
03now the RDNS isn't even working?
bye Rainbow Dash
I see you have Magicka and some of the DLC
Nittany_Discord: The button above the OK button on the mane screen
03oh wait, I know why.
11,01Got it.
03I ran into this before
03if I turn Windows Firewall off, it breaks the entire thing
I wish Dashie would drag out Seapony Lyra! Squee! :D
I dont hear anything
some people have professional mics for streaming, I have a USB rock band mic
Same here
:p
It seems to disable my speakers without listing them as... it's 0115, my brain's not working...
Hope you figure it out. Time for bed. (I hope I dream of Princess Luna :$)
My laptop's internal mic is good enough for me. Too bad my speakers aren't as good.
Ahhhhh AC, you are my best friend atm
I think I'm gonna go to bed before my brain becomes 100% derp
My laptop has an internal mic, but it only works on Linux for some reason
I should do my BRIAN BLESSED voice right now... it's not like everyone's sleeping or anything
...
1I think I'm gonna go to bed before my brain becomes 100% derp
oops
See you all tomorrow!
I took a 30min nap 4 hours ago, but I might fall asleep too
Goodnight everypony!
Biglaw: Dream of Ponies

Good night Everypony!
Sumica: I love this song
RainBowJack: oh right, I keep forgeting everponys not on the EST like me
gnight Biglaw|AFK!
Know what my brother told me yesterday? He dreamt I met a girl from Australia and was meeting her in person for the first time.
Night Biglaw|AFK
00,10song's good, intro is crap
awesome song.. shitty intro
Hooray, my internal mic works now!
oh, that is a problem, thats why i always get the console version of things, but the wii one i just dont get.
Sumica: I actually like songs with those kind of noises
I bought the wii version because I wanted a wireless portal
00,10that intro was not song it was just bad noise that eventaly became song. once it was all song it was good.
11,01My sound settings are messed up.
00,10the intro was painfull
11,01My speakers won't function now.
0,14is that Tool?
11,01Yes.
hmm, well we're hearing your tunes...
11,01I hate that I have technical difficulties half the time I stream.
dat bad luck
Do you think you might consider doing some Magicka?
Holy crap. 280 thumbs up on the new fic in like an hour? That's crazy.
I'm probably going to buy my copy tomorrow morning.
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/31089/The-Three-Sisters ... too bad its a sad fic. I don't like them
11,01Can someone help me. I used to never have this problem.
Never learned how to stream. Can't help ya
Nittany_Discord: How old is your computer?
11,016+ years
So we're hearing the music but you're not hearing it?
Maybe its just dying
11,01Not sure if it's dying.
ello
11,01Hasn't show any signs of dying.
CupcakeWarrior: speakers aren't a neccessary part of a computer
hey I'm going to head off
True
window's sound routing is actually really, really bad
Is this a laptop you're on or a desktop?
ill probably be back on tomorrow, see yous
lets cremate it
He has a desktop
programs will choose outputs, and it's really difficult to change'
i went on tv, and some one diised us on a late show!
What channel?
dissed*
idk
What show was it?
As in dissing bronies, or the community of Bronystate?
that mutherfuking piece o shit
bronies
11,01I think it's VAC.
VAC?
ok bye.
Oh. Have you tried restarting Steam?
11,01I don't have Steam running.
11,01VAC = Virtual Audio Cable.
Well I partied like a Pinkie Pie today.
Hi Litwick
Oh, okay.
Just one :O
I wonder if restarting the computer might help.
My sound card died a while ago...
So I launched a rocket. And killed all my astronauts.
Everypony wish my mtoher a happy birthday right now! I want to give her a gift of a different variety!
Happy b-day Litwick's mom!
Happy birthday to Litwick's mom! :D
11,01Happy birthda Litwick's mom!
Were your astronauts unhatched scootaloos?
11,01*birthday
happy birthday!
0,14Happy birthday, mother of Litwick
Do we have streamception again?
Happy birthday Lit's mom! :)
I can see FOREVER! :O
/me yawns
I told my mother about what I did she said "And why did you do that?"
What did you do?
My response? "Because I could."
CupcakeWarrior: I told the chat to wish my mtoher a happy birthday. Cuz I'm sweet and shit.
Because ponies, thats why!
We're hearing more music. You?
For the good of all of us, except the ones who are dead, Litwick ?
Does she know youre a brony?
Oh, this intro again
11,01I might cut stream due to tech difficulties.
Oh, it's Virtual Audio Cable.
Aw
Let's see if restarting your computer helps.
Litwick: Does she know you like ponies?
Nittany_Discord: What's the problem?
Told her about it a month ago :/
11,01No sound.
She didn't mind.
Nittany_Discord: But we're getting sound.
11,01I'm not.
His speakers died, or something
11,01No.
That's the crazy thing about it.
lol
Everyone refresh
11,01It's transmitting sound, but it's not sending anything to my speakers.
lol
From what I see, the speakers aren't getting sound...wonder why.
Hm.
It. Is a mystery.
/me strokes moustache
Maybe it's a problem with the speakers or the connection
is the app that should be sending sound listed in the mixer for your speakers?
Clearly, a beaver has stolen the input cable
Bronystate isnt working for me now :(
A beaver? Nitt's Canadian now?
No. But the beaver spy network has long claws. and sharp teeth
And a very large tail.
CupcakeWarrior: A fate worse than death.
secret bases in dams around the world
But why would the beavers target us?
jealous of ponies getting all the love?
Because we forsook them... forsaken? forsaked?
11,01There are beavers in Pennsylvania.
Right the first time.
where are the my little beaver plushies
because we cannot conjugate the verb forsake!
There are beavers in my state as well
I did not know that bronystate had a technical difficulties video
My stream is a Youtube vid of Derpy upside down and it says BronyState we are currently experiencing technical difficultis.
with classy music from sim city
UGGGH SIM CITY! :[
I like this video. Who made it?
Is Sim City good?
o lord I just realize
dunno. barely played it, but the soundtrack to sim city 4 is divine
CupcakeWarrior: Nope.avi. It's boring :|
Well someone doesnt like simulation games
I think I just might. Thanks Derpy.
/me skips around
lol
there's nothing quite like building an interlinked highway system, tall skyscrapers... and then unleashing Godzilla on it
I think Shizuka made the video
13which
pong!
13oh
oh hai Shizuka
This one, Shizu.
13technical derpiculties~
Yes we are, thanks Derpy
Bee3ry: I havent played sim city since the 2000 edition, are meteors a form of natural distster?
Don't be silly. Meteors are just the universal equivalent of "urban redevelopment"
Now, locusts...
o-o
Are you hearing that? Because we're hearing that.
locusts <3
o-o
derpy is upside down lol thats ok
13anyway yes i made this video for exactly this kind of situation
why is derpy on?
nya
Derpy is upside down, and all is right with the world
D:
Shizuka: is good video to explain that somepony fucked up
It's a fun vid, Shizu. Makes waiting not terrible.
Shizuka is always prepared for derpiculties emergency
everyone enjoying the show
what show?
XD
Everyone loves you Shizuka
D:
She's the resident tech goddess. It's part of her portfolio to be prepared for derpiculties.
makes me want some more muffin stew
13eeyup
hi every 1 c:
Tech and screwups are inseparable.
13though i'm more proud of the railings animatic and my demo reel
LOL... :D Minnesota news... Slow day I guess... Why to mosquitos cause red lumps! :D Well, you see... :)
pfft railings
13the awards show was too much stress for me to properly like
The demo reel has some of the best music ever.
Diablo 3 is nice! :D HEY KIDS! I'm Back! :D
Hey FlareChaser, enjoying the technical derpiculties?
oh there you are Flare
Shizuka, what was the trippy pong game in your demo reel
13plasma pong
Well, you did a good job on that video.
FlareChaser: buy me that
08,01finally level 60 \o/
CupcakeWarrior: Actually, everything was fine :)
Nittany_Discord: all fixed?
sounds fancy
13google it, the guy got C&D'd by atari so you can't get it from the developer anymore
04Scary image o.o
13but it might be mirrored somewhere
Shamroc: it was $62...
11,01Finally.
08,01and now i discover that i need to have cataclysm to fly in EK and Kalimdor...
we got stream!
Shizuka, why would they do that?
alrighty
Yay stream
13atari owns the trademark to "pong"
what won the lottery?
SOUND!
13also refresh
Yay~!
We can hear your mic loud and clear.
WoW was so last year =p
11,01Shizuka: Fucking trademark abuse.
08,01FlareChaser: well, technically after 1.5 months
Shizuka: Found it, on some random site.
08,01because that's how long i've been playing for
13AlejrandoMoist: but basically it's much like zenimax suing mojang over "scrolls", they have to defend their marks
Hey there Nittany's voice!
Trademark issues?
/me dances
08,01FlareChaser: burning crusade, for some reason
what won the lottery?
nowai
08,01no idea why; didn't buy it
13problem is the plasma pong guy was C&D'd in like 2006 or 2008, but i have the last version he did
BC comes with WoW now
08,01Paladin_Drakkenwolf: why would i do that?
http://download.cnet.com/Plasma-Pong/3000-2099_4-10511143.html Because I know some people are too lazy to google.
08,01WoW is one of the only games i enjoy playing
and it's free till 2
I'm sure I can find it somewhere
20*
I can hear ya Nittany_Discord :D
Somewhere over the rainbow
A tad
Its quiet Nitt
nah. fine here
uys! who won the lottery?
depends on how loud the game is ...
I won the lottery
Back
Me! Well, almost
WorldTraveler: some DMV workers in Missouri.
We can hear you.
Hey again Alister.
13good volume
yeah, Cata killed wow...
Ow

08,01Paladin_Drakkenwolf: my drug game is Linux
so was raiding and turning a game into near a friggen job
what is this?
Is there multiplayer to this game?
Skip the tutorial like a boss.
Yet
but soon
SOON
Nitt, skip it.
I might pick it bacn up for abit when Mists comes out
So whats this game about?
You don't need to know how to play!
so I'm wondering what movies won
08,01if i could draw, i'd draw my OC with a penguin, telling it "i wish i could quit you"
no
Add a crapton of solid-fuel boosters, and screw with the pitch/yaw/etc.
Do you just build a rocket?
08,01DeathStar: dooo eeet!
anypony?
lolnope
Penguins are op.
08,01WorldTraveler: look on the news
Single-click.
08,01it's probably there
in before his rocket explodes and KILLS EVERYONE
08,01front page of the site
its not on yet
DeathStar, include argyle socks somewhere in there
There's two flarechasers ?
08,01oh, it was zombieland and something rubbish, i think
AlejrandoMoist: ok :)
08,01some ripoff of harry potter and lrod of the rings
Max Magician and the Quest for the Rings?
lrod
08,01Magical Max and the LEgend of the Ring
08,01aye, that's the one
Sounds dumb
I never get picked..... *sad face*
LOL, I wasn't too far off! :$
08,01pinkyspice: there will be no reroll
That's why we need lottery WEEK
08,01it was chosen fair and square
PONIES on TV!!! Yay! :(
08,01it's a song
Woah let's calm down kids
Thank God I didn't get picked. Then you guys would be watching corny Japanese live-action movies.
i wonder how many people will stay for the b movie then
08,01imagine it being played on acoustic guitar and cello
08,01because that's what i was doing earlier
Nittany_Discord: So this is a rocket building game?
i.e the movies everyone picked?
08,01AlejrandoMoist: we pick new moview
do you guys still have the list
08,01somewhere
my drug games: all my my games.
08,01well, for backlog, to to the backlog page
can we have lottery week?
08,01Reikim: i'm going to
This is good.
08,01next week some time, if i can get access to the recording studio
08,01richfiles: i don't, but i know someone who does
I mean like using everyone's pick for that week, you pick 10 winners. 5 A movies and 5 B movies
Well , this is getting boring. I,m gonna go to bed. Reikim Bronysith FlareChaser|Diablo3 good night to you my best buds. We'd just need two more person to have our ''mane'' cast. anyway good night
so they can be shown Mon-Fri
Take the SAS unit for fun stuff.
Alister: night! wait what?
as part of a Lottery week
Alister: NIGHT
I have one, with all 3 Panzer Dragoon games! and 2 or 3 Shining games! :)
Alister: Dream of Ponies
name it the Luna
Name it the Luna!
Oh wait, stream lag, I'm too late.
but what if luna explodes?
Paladin_Drakkenwolf: one time I had a dream where I fought a giant rock spider while twilight assisted me with her magic. I can't top that
And night Alister
It can't be the Luna. It won't make it to the moon with only one stage
inb4 he dies
inb4 everyone dies
Alister: Yes you can. You can do so with badass future Twilight.
08,01i think Luna would be the most comfortable pony to ride
Now i wanna where the rocket goes before going to bed
Escape from Manehattan
08,01Reikim: normal size ponies are tiny
Don't do it like the Koreans!
True dat, but that's only if we assume that we know their size.
08,01WorldTraveler: no innuendo
Pew pew?
00,10well the plus side is even if you die on the pad you still got 63m
Oh noes... Hurt horse on TV! Swollen tendon, missed chance to beat a record not touched since '78 :'(
08,01inb4 ponies are actually 2 stories tall, and everything on their world is scaled to match
what game is this?
00,02SPAAACE!
Just launch!
spaaaaaaaaaaaaaace
08,01i love horses
you gonna die son
08,01any horse riders in?
5 4 3 2 1 blastoff
00,10beep boop son, beep boop
/me isn't a horse rider
Isn't Nittany the one who streamed Orbiter that one time? And screwed up horribly?
Ive never rode a horse befor
08,01neither have i
I'm nowhere near any horses
08,01but i want to learn
is this Orbiter?
08,01maybe this summer
00,10Horseback rideing is fun out here in the cooler months
I've been on a horse years ago.
staying up for launch
your crew looks scared
I AM a horse....
08,01AlejrandoMoist: i'm in the countryside, so i have 3 or 4 different riding schools close to me to choose from
My mom says I have, but I think I would remember something like that
That would be a funny fic to read. Some dude gets put in Eqestria, and is only the size of a ponies fore leg. Or smaller
Ok I think I got some of the roles down in our ''mane cast'' Me : Twilight. FlareChaser|Diablo3 : Rainbow Dash. Reikim : Pinkie and Bronysith : uhhh AppleJack ? idk you decide sith
I'm Pinkie? When did that happen?
Alister: ugh
I had a mosquito drink itself to death on my arm. It drank till it exploded, then flew away. The blood hit my OTHER arm! :O
ponies are about the size of a golden retreiver
*doe
08,01Alister: you missed out me as Pinkie Pie
*does
Alister: I get to be Rainbow Dash?! :D
00,10wait what? roles?
Bronysith would be Molestia Alister
Reikim: you said so yourself earlier
/me puts on hat
08,01AlejrandoMoist: it's scotland, not hades.
CupcakeWarrior: why ?
I would be Guyra
Oh yeah...
Scoltland
00,10You are playing roles?
Alister: Bronysith loves Molestia
FlareChaser|Diablo3: cuz your OC is a pegasus

08,01WorldTraveler: scootaland

Alister: true....true..

Bronysith: you like Molestia ?

Nittany_Discord: houston, we have a problem.

Ghosties: That...doesn't exist on this planet.

Alister: Why?
08,01okay, gimme a sec to get some food
Nittany_Discord: Crash into Canada

Nittany_Discord: Try throttling the crap out of your liquid-fuel rocket until it explodes.
you're not patting it witha a newspaper are you? ;)
guess those astronauts were right to be terrified of that trip
At least for every failure, leads to a great success
00,10yes bigger so you have further to fall.
It's almost 2 pm.

NUTS AND BOLTS ALL OVER AGAIN

Tassadork: Flares*

Nittany_Discord: Wings. Wings everywhere.
Will there be Pony rerun stream at 10:00 later?

richfiles: LEGOS! I hate legos :|
Needs more Discord
needs to be about 20% oatmeal...
but seriously you don't put wings like that.
it needs to be painted red! red things go faster
Good morning Dr Falken. Would you like to play a game?
Legos rock, unless you step on them.
anyone here ever play gizmos and gadgets?
I went to college and have a degree in Rocket science I should know
It needs more cloak and dagger
otakon: bitch please, where i'm from, we go down twice a round

richfiles: I wasted so much time with them. I spent so much money on them. :|
In my time , we didn't have rockets. We kicked someone in the ass till he flied up to the moon
You see, I'm a Hobbit.
00,10dont you need decouplers?
So I can walk on Legos.

I THINK MAYBE THERE WAS A PROBLEM

Nittany, WINGS ON BOTTOM
Nittany_Discord, make a rocket so tall, you don't need to launch it to reach space
Call Zvezda to get that rocket flying!
What Nittany_Discord does best explodes! :D
I was going to make a 9/11 joke about this, but then I realized it was plane wrong.
No sonic rainboom for you!!!!
FlareChaser: I like to discuss politics
WINGS man

I think maybe - just maybe - you need more control surfaces. For, yknow, control.
what is that inbetween piece?

Nittany_Discord: needs more wings!
00,10the hell are those?
now put wings on the bottom
Now more rockets on those

Sumica, remember, YOLO
you did not just
moo/
oink
YOU OBVIOUSLY LOVE OREOS!
Sumica: you only live once
#YOLO
also, Sumica, 3 pronged base = more stability
Thats what YOLOY means
It's the new hip young lingo kids are using
lol
Practical? Not good enough
00,02DO IT
Cant have that
Sumica: now we cant have that
yeah, you should fix that/...
Sumica, what about 12?
until you take aero dynamics into it XD
lawl
dat Sumica logic
Sumica: YOLO is just another excuse for people to do dumb shit
great logic, sumi :p
That would make 16 thrice as good
just the middle!?
you will roast us all!
this will work out so well
GOOD BYE ATMOSPHERE!

MOAR
Nittany_Discord: 6_9
/me 11,016_9
lol
Hmmm. it needs, something... More...
Sumica: inb4 it just implodes killing the planet
We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.
I think NASA should fund this
Om: but what?
...then they died
you know, its better to be thicker at the bottom, that way you arent top heavy >_>
11,01AlejrandoMoist: I wish I lived in the 60's.
KiwiBoi777: Its tough to say... But, I think. rockets? And lots of them
zepplins in a dead heat?
First the Moon, then we go to Equestria
00,02inb4 BOOM
but top heavy = falling XD
hmmmmm, moar rockets would probably help
11,01It'll be 20 years before we touch the moon again, and that's if private industry doesn't fail.
inb4 everything went better than expected
Sumica liek big BOOM
Yes MOAR!
YAY
Yes Sumica, make the number of rockets dwarf the rockets up top
Im saying that 12 rockets on the top is a bad idea XD
Helloooo!

Oh hey Discord :3
night Bluestorm_S
Nittany_Discord: take the struts off the bottom
Nittany_Discord use simple designs for your rocket, more doesn't mean better it just make the whole thing complicated
Sumica, when you start, dont go full thrust right out of the gate. Start low and work up
06it still works, and has no scratches, thats important
/me not now Polydunami
yes
Hm?
11,01Pinkies4thWall and Bluestrom_S: This is Sumica, not me streaming.
Bronystate the website I go on everyday and spend any spare time here :P
congrats
Rain, what are you talking about, clearly FULL POWER at the start is better
hey!!!!
O.O
I must be losing it
Polydunami: i think it means hes busy
Its works
ahahahahaaaaa
KA-BOOOOOOOM!
lol
So ded...
WOW
PPPPPPPPPPPPPPFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT HAHAHAHAHAHA!

Sumica: take the struts off the bottom
ahh ok my apologies Nittany_Discord, anyways have fun with the rockets their great enjoyment
Oh well
good night all
apple products are famous for being dropped and not break
Can't have fun ALL the time
Sumica: DANG IT! IT'S 3:35 AM AND I GOTTA HOLD IN MY LAUGHING! :D
even if the screen cracks
Polydunami: ;)
Rain, if they go later, than we get less power, and therefore an inferior rocket
06maybe because of the compact design? like, no space underneath the housing?
but if the all go at once, they will blow up XD
LOLOLOLOLLOL
ka booom
O____O
not sure
a lot of error
lol
WOW
KA-BOOOOOOOM!
What the hell!? xD
Sumica didn't secure the rockets
i think ya forgot the connecters Sumica
or simply i products are too simplistic to break
ah ha ha ha
We know one thing.
Sumica: are you secretly Michael Bay?
dat feeling when you are looking for an anime and every link is for megaupload....
Not enought rockets
06everything is simple to break, when you want it to, tbh
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Ikr
O hey TheGreatAndPowerfulT :)
lol
Sumica, you didn't have enough railings
Sumica: add more secure rods
Use connectors on the outer most rockets
Ugh, megaupload
06but, i.e. an iPhone or HTC HD 2 arent really phones you want to break, right?
way too much science in that
not sure
/me hardly noticed when megaupload went down
Welp gtg cyall
oh wow
then dont go full throtle at the start XD
Sumica: or you could add moar rockets
dat poho
