I don't get a thing I'm watching
is he trying to get to the safe?
oh he is
nah heavymetalpony
HeavyMetalPony: we all are.
That he did
!
best song on the soundtrack is Time
Hans Zimmer is a genious
by far
PWN'D
YOURS IS THE LAST BODY WE NEED TO BE REBORN. THE MAKERS MUST BE ABSORBED
Zimmer got robbed, his score is amazing.
Yes
Time is amazing
I prefer non-original scores
Hans Zimmer doesn't write all his own music, you guys know. he has a bunch of guys that do parts of it
puppydog eyes
but koreas is faster
In all honesty, though, I'm glad The King's Speech won over Inception for best film
north or south?
Just like Across the Universe: disregard plot, aqquire awesome music.
Dream is Collapsing
um south
Nice silencer/flash supressor there.
Probably south
The Kings Speech is an epic film
Nah, Social Network whould've one, and 127 Hours was my favorite
That it is
never saw TKS
My friend...save me! Friend: Ok *shoots him in the head*
Lol
*meow*
his classy vests
8the casting in this movie is brilliant
Looks like killing his friend is causing the house to kill itself
more like an adaptation of the same novel
LOL i've got 68 listeners XD
That it is
and now cobb somehow reads the entire document in three seconds
/me hides
I was actually scared for this as I saw Shutter Island before Inception
XD
He may have just been looking for 1 thing
....
and I thought Inception was going to be as shitty as Shutter Island
Yeah talk about ensemble cast
where you at FluxBrony ?
11SLAP!
is shutter island the one about the organ farm
SPLIKNOT Florida
The King's Speech was superbly made at least

even though the plot wasn't too interesting

Nolan-especial time
LE WOOSH
I was hoping for evil conspiracy, but it's like I got mental blue balls from watching Shutter Island
Drowning, not the best way to go even if you are in a dream
y'know, now that I think about it
no the place was his dream
lol u mad?
although it's much less gratuitous than it used to be
you guys realize its 2 am in Beijing and like 2 pm over there i namerica and like 8 pm in europe ?

2 am? heh

Shortround?
yeah, DiCaprio was terrible when he was playing the pretty boy
now he's really good
why is it counting down

I had a dream a few nights ago that my hair was blue like my ponysona, lol
hmmm
there is SOME time perception difference
out of all my dreams, only 1% of them are realistic

winston, that's not the reason it doesn't fall though
I hate movies with this much fluctuation between the quiet and loud parts.
friction does not exist in the dream world
now, if the owner of the totem
was the dreamer
it would fall like normal

Have a good night.

OKAY GOOD NIGHT THEN
G'night. See you later.
Albert?
Alfred, silly :P
See ya, Slipknot
is she making her totem?
thanks guys
WHY ARE YOU STANDING AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM THOUGH
It's a chess piece
"experiments"
she's weighted it uniquely
Like it does now.
meaning only she knows how it should react
23.6 grams. That is unique.
note cobb can actually tell her how his works and still have it work
dat 23.6 grams
hospital, doesn't she mean hospitable?
because she's never actually seen it spun
lol
But i did
inb4 first 'one thing you need to know about me'
Mol can use cheat codes.
11RANDOM TOTEM TRIVIA: Ariadne's totem is a bishop chess piece, representing how she attempts to lead Cobb to confront his subconcious version of Mal
lol
I don't get it... how does a bishop represent that?
^
wouldn't a pawn lead the way?
That.
Leader
...?
religious leader
or a knight
Exactly.
this is psychology
^
lol
yes
or a queen
I know that
Its because adrianec can only walk diagonally
You must connect with the Lord, and HALLELUJAH
tbh that makes no sense at all
specificity?
Religious leaders are not very good leaders
wouldn't a queen make more sense?
queens can't move unless all the others infront move
Does that mean that Cobb's totem represents that he's living on temporarily, and at any point he could fall?
Boogidy boogidy boogidy amen?
Talledega Nights?
I'd go with a knight for a totem.
11WinstonChurchil: That's a good one.
*bitchslap*
booga booga booga booga
What's up with the die totem that one dude has?
loaded die
always falls on one side
in someone else's dream
My Totem is a toenail clipper.
it would fall randomly
Protip: Don't drink free airplane champegne before an incpetion mission
but how would he find out?
That makes no sense. ._.
see only he knows which way it's loaded
a dreamer wouldn't know that
(The brain capacity thing)
and the die would fall based on THEIR physics
11...you are looking into the whole Bishop thing too much.
lol he dreams of boats and hoes 4 ten years
hence, it would fall randomly
8dreaming about ponies for 10 years
8WANT
haha, wait, was that supposed to be a joke?
Do i just leave or how does this work
me too
Hipster_Brony: For once I concur.
Hipster_Brony agree
I could dream with that
I wouldn't mind dreaming about ponies for 10 years
same
You can just customize is.
Dat Piaf again
cuz he's a chemist and chemists can do that
lol they haven't shown fall weather frinds on the hub in a while
My dreams are generally awesome :P
11"I bought the airline. It seemed...neater." lol
03LOL
slipknot: you have to die to get out of the stream
DragonRage: It would be longer than that in the dream if 5 real minutes = 1 hour in the dream.

Elky lol
My dreams are weird
8i got that bitch an airline
Elky: hahaha ya i already did
Kaiba's hero right there.
HeavyMetalPony, imagine waking up after 10 years in a dream though
SCREW THE DREAMS I HAVE MONEY.
Dreams are never as cohesive as in movies
Agreed.
12that is his home
Neater in two ways.
Now to invade his sexeh dream time
11"In trying to write a team-based creative process, I wrote the one I know," said Nolan.
10 year pony dream? It would be easier to just take LSD.
it would crush you to know nothing you did was real after 10 years in the world
12:P
Tell me about it, a041744.
i wish i did
they probably got dared to make a movie more confusing than the matrix
12where do you go before work?
12or school
Yeah, but... it's ponies... even if I did end up like the Sloth victim in Se7en
If I could understand even one of my dreams, I'd be convinced I'm actually having them.
aren't most dreams somewhat pr0n?
03s6till
the matrix....confusing?....what...?
Man this girl is nosy
03that wasn't on the board
More often than not I just forget them in a daze and/or take a shower if necessary.
By the time I'm aware that I'm dreaming, I wake up.
12hmm
11OHSHI-!
K its not that confusing, just to Neo
NO

Gunshot?

Because dreams entertain us you silly girl
Like that, but weirder.
yes I have- ohhhh
BECAUSE INCEPTION BITCH
@Frubban:I saw that episode monday!
he's a mod lol
although i probably would wake up because pinkie would break my dream
Don't go to /b/!
dreams are not biologically important, but they do play a nice role in the thought process. Sleep in and of itself is good though
I am... a /b/tard.
it is a silly place
lol, that's awesome
"I can't act."
It's dreams, I aint gonna explain shit
Frubban i lovedc that episode
"I am a pedophile"
you wake up?
Dreaming has several different potential explanations. Some psychologists think of it as "static", for example.
also, I heard he eats hay

It's hard to follow first time round
those lazy, lazy writers
11Try watching this movie through Fischer's POV. It's just as epic.
watch it again
they just planted the idea
I didn't it was that complicated...
Mister Fischer used Fissure. It's a One hit KO.
Well i'm leaving now if anyone cares. Which they don't... oh well.
Not really.
4But Browning would never have said that unless they planted it there
they didn't plant the words
Ciao, Timmymonsta.
Fishers not the projections dream you dumb girl
they planted the idea that Browning was lying to him

They're molding Fischer's thoughts, to alter how the projection of Browning acts.

it's all that Cobb remembers from his time in Limbo
Its been a long time sense anyone been to limbo
dftyuiop
4@LoneWolf414: Because it's deteriorating
therefore time took over
He hasn't been at that level for a whilw.
limbo was built hundreds of years ago by cobb and mal
Dream magic
4No one's been around to take care of it
*while
There can't be a level 10
Level 5 is Equestria
4So it fell apart
ponies and inception? do not want
0level 11 - Whoville
Of course there is
note that until Cobb got down here
level 10 is actually level 11
when it was just Fischer
they'res no way that can be right!
It's only logical
it was just the beach
Floor 13?
it takes on his memory of it
INCEPTION!Y U CONFUSE US?!
looks like a dump to me
digging for worms at a sidewalk
He built Hiroshima?
apokafish
0Floor 13 is Warehouse 13
Therefore pulling yourself up is easier
yes
I thought he built Albany
Dude, he has a lot of houses

Meow
The meow was our kick.
It's not acceptable to call dreams Ewoks.
Meow
Including cats.
Dang, I left sometime during last night and came back, I might have missed it
... and yeah, that was about the point where the movie went crazy.
/me yawns
HEAR!
12:<
/me yawns
11We were watching Inception when a cat ad appeared on DCD's comp, meowing loudly over the stream.
this movie's not pretentious, it lays all the answers out for you
That girl looks like someone from Pleasantville.
/me yawn loudest
D: I...I missed that?
4Ahahahaha
We're still stuck in limbo, shit
again?
*s
you did yes.

12xD
No
Yeah I missed inception and came back for rotten tomatoes, DAM YOU FAMILY PROBLEMS!
4Inception takes The Matrix's idea of perception and reality and KICKS IT UP X10
no, you might still get a pick
her lie was his reality
at the end of the movie is when the lottery occurs young skywalker
/me dsdfgysdfgfgh
i did it to her
4Pretty much, Espy
/me yawns louder
Wow, Ramona Flowers has a great performance in this movie.
Agent Smith > Cobol Engineering.
Something wrong, Pizzapony?
Ramona Flowers?WHERE?
She went to level -1 after that.
lol no rollerblades
4Ramona Flowers isn't in this movie
Minus dream world.
11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Prints of the movie were shipped to theaters under the name "Hour Glass".
0so how does the lottery work?
4Nor is it the latest Die Hard film
In before kick.
inception works surprisingly well
It just works
the reason they use a train
like inception fuggetaboutit!
floor 1 time
/me yawns wider
CHOO CHOO
Idea: Ship it under the name Inception.
0@nah thanks
he wasn't sure she'd do it if he did
/me yawns some more
running on a rail
/me yawns longer

i like trains

Cancer D:
OOHWWWHHHHHH NAAOOOUUUGH

Magic Aed go.
L4D'D
L4D?WHERE?
4Dee can bitch about the movie if he wants to, it's his right
wait, did you guys already do the lottery?
11The only film we've ever rejected was someone asking for South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut for A movie.
Why?
Whoops, missed the whole for the grenade
hole*
Guys
at the end of the movie is when the lottery occurs young skywalker
it did someone suggested it and it was turned down in favour of Battlefield Earth I think?
i never said he couldn't I just said it was annoying
Zappity zap zap
ugh
Anyone know where that is?
we could have watched SP instead of BE?
D:
right
4Probably A
A movie
Both?
Superbad is A
/me 11has a list of really bad B-movies to chose.
All of edgar Wrights films are A
Fantastic Adventures of Unico?
Superbad is one of my favourite movies
ouch, she just stabbed him in the chest
DICAPRIO!Y U STARTLE THE WITCH?!
lol
Tropic Thunder is an A movie.
4Mainly because that one movie with all the action stars was released in theaters around the same time
whut do u mean U PEEPLE?
oh no
Dat buildup
it's this scene
oh yes
I... I won't cry
4Deathproof?

I don't mind a wide description, but stick to one. Not that once week it's a cheap movie, one week it's a bad movie and another it's a weird movie
/me curls up and sleeps, slightly annoyed at being awoken
lol dr octogonapus BWaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh
Aflac-olypse

11Nolan knows how to deliver on an emotional level here.

Incomplete conbination.

Four different kicks, architect and businessman only move three levels.
'I'm just gonna have to make this quick!'
Inception: making all film scores sound exactly the same since Summer 2010
WinstonChurchill, prepare yourself
Okay, this is how this works
BUT YOU MADE ROSE PROMISE TO NEVR LET GO
Isn't pirahna like really fucked up?
we start on limbo
From here on out...I'm lost
Ariadne and Fischer kick out
have any of the Python movies been "A" movies yet?
0This is still inception right?
I'll explain later
yes
At least all movie trailers have the same score thank to inception.
Trivia: Nolan invented the subwoofer specifically for this film
I might be lying, there.
Coolio
The Sub-subwoofer
I hear people say 'budget' but I never see an actual definition.
How long until the lottery?
The Great Mouse Detective - Critical success, technically a commercial failure
Dam stream, work right for me
OF ALL TIME
lol Ihate the romans how much? A LOT
Rescuers Down Under is a... ... A movie.
Out of all 3 of them
11The Great Mouse Detective....personally an A movie, but not exaCTLY SURE.
we need a Mel Brooks film for the A movie sometime
y u hate me
Damn, there are lots of good animated movies involving mice.
It's A
I always get lost in this part
awwww, I remember that movie
I used to watch it a lot when I was younger
6Dat full circle
4We return to the beginning
4I see the plot twist
lol
Piranha 3D is a BAD movie.And i mean BAAAAAD.
okay get this
Did he just say Godzilla?
I don't know if this is a flashback or a dream
/me is now nostalgic for the existence of VHSs
He is in limbo now
this part confuses me.
Framed narratives make either less sense in movies or more. There is no mid-ground
oh ok
Why?
The beginning was a flashforward. All of the movie was building up to this scene.
THis is a dream, they're in Limbo
Piranha 3D is hilarious and entertaining...and one of my favorite films of all time
Darken YES
Saito's totem reminds him he is
they all wake up
11RainbowLoon: I have a complete list of BMN history. Minus the pony episodes watched.
4The beginning did one of those things the director of Pulp Fiction does
I like Saito's limbo
ahh ok
but wouldn't killing themselves send them down another level?
alright guys look here i got this figured out
no
ride trhe hasslehoff!
limbo is it
pay attention to his left hand
4THERE WE GO
Best music of the film here
there is no lower level
Not from Limbo
Killing themselves here would wake them up
How the heck did he get out of limbo
Limbo automatically boots you to level 1
Limbo is the lowest you can go.
They killed each other
if you kill yourself in limbo, you wake up
period
Halo annocer:Suicide!
but guys look watch pay attention to cobb's left hand
lol limbo is lowest
pew pew thats how
@_0
Success!
Best song in the movie
Jon: or betrayal?
4Basically, everything was a dream
immigration!
is this the track "Time"?
@.@
Because it can be very easy to lose yourself in it.
yes
Cause if you think limbo is real
This is Time
Its awesome
Because Limbo is lik eMinecraft on steroids
yeah
When watching Inception for the second time, it isn't half as elegant for some reason
therefore the kill yourself thing seems very real.
the only way to escape limbo is to die
12!Shipping
11http://pastebin.com/A1A58QpA
No, you can still kick
11There.
I lost the flow of the movie.Not a single sense was given that day.
elky, watch it a dozen times :P
I think it's twice as elegant
That's how Ariadne got out.
I guess the score just lets you gloss over the plot holes and arbitrary restrictions
You understand how it all fits together the second time around.
Fastest customs evar
inb4 auuuuugh, come on!
Anyone know the name of this song?
dat DiCaprio frownline.
*glee*

4Now
11repost just in case.
4Supposedly
it's the story of Cobb getting over his guilt
WinstonChurchill: They had a second episode?
I thought that two-parter made them scarier
Don't f*cking cry...
Downfall parodys up in this BMN.
4The dredel topples
/me brohoofs HeavyMetalPony
well yeah
4But they cut that
I am too lazy to remove the <prince-dari>: from the list

tell me tell me TELL ME!
11nope.avi

Instead of having people pick the same pony eps every two week, why not just do them in rotation

11SCOTT PILGRIM
11That's our lineup, folks. Tune in Next week!
Because, frankly, and I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm starting to get sick of the pony eps that keep getting chosen.
11And now we return you to the rest of this week's BMN.

I dunno I like Twi's solo
Holla holla get $
chorus is best solo
And thus, everyone spontaneously bursts into song.
11actually, I really like the chorus as much as I like the solos.
Agreed, Mazoot ;)
Bullshit, Pinkie's solo is the best!
oh really?

Go Rainbow!
poor Dash, but at least the Wonderbolts are genuinely cool guys. They're not jerk-idols
All 6 of the mane cast are cool, but Rarity is simply best pony.

For me it's less "Rainbow Dash is/is not a lesbian" and more "RD is/isn't gay because TOKEN CLICHE ETC."
I mean tbh Derpy woudl aso fit..
4In that case, then it works that she's bi
yeahi'm fine with bi
4Hence, it would fit for Ramona
dat tumpit
tomatoes don't explod
Genius!
and they're BRAVEER
Also, Rainbow Dash is asexual, like all childrens' cartoon chartacters - at least in canon. In fanon she can be whatever you want.
Rainbow Dash = The Toddster?!?

ee-...nah
...
hm, maybe an Appleloosa spinoff show?
i'm a slowpoke
actually
like a western parody
s2 could be past since this would be epic :D
another different Appleloosa ep would be cool though
ugh, that'd be terrible
one not involving the buson
bison
...i don't care
wut?]
let's just watch downloaded pony episodes
I just hope Trixie won't be like she's portrayed in the fandom
haha yeah
In Trixie's case less villain than 'Ridiculously overinflated ego of a wannabe-helpful that only makes everything worse. Hilarity ensues'
Too many spins?
as in twilight's fuck buddy?
yep
The only fandom character I was to see portrayed like in the fandom is Luna
/me is hoping for a collective fangasm when the animators sneak a random abacus into the Luna episode's background.
lol
she'd need a lot of episodes/character developement to shine, and I just don't see that happening
yesterday, i dreamed luna talking whit twilight
Luna IS now co-princess. I don#t see why she wouldn't get snippets of more than one episode, kinda like celestia did (If less so)
well, the fandom has Luna as a stereotypical nerd/emo pony
i hope it's krastos
I'm back
in socks
Hey Peg
and a character like this can be easily made bland with not enough screentime
Krastos,the best badguy ever.
A Bear?I thought he was a demon-thing!
suddently, spins
celestia should be the villain
well we know Luna is confirmed for at least 1 episode in season2, maybe she'll just get a one off appearence
7omg nearly 3000!
or other G1 villains, for that matter
As amusing as trollestia/ evil empres celestia are in the fandom, I think I only want to see the canon celestia in the series
^
No.Trollestia IS canon.
more like lightJokelestia
maybe
I also hope Spitfire/The Wonderbolts make more appearences
Wonderbolts are problematic

Brock Lesnar is a pro wrestler! he doesnt know BJJ! Hes gonna be a joke!.... Lesnar wins the heavyweight title in a week and keeps it for years, never trains in BJJ, only wrestles. BJJ nutriders cry. All is right with the world

4What do you watch?
Mostly WWE, since that's what's on TV
I would watch TNA if they could get their act together.
4*nods*
And ROH is coming to a network channel I allegedly have, but that seems to have stopped working right for a couple weeks now.
/me runs
over 8000!!!
Have you seen "Joker" Sting?
only 1001 more spins to go
Wow. It's still going.
lol!
4@Ignaesia: Russo, Bischoff, Hogan
Vince Russo
Godammit...
8000
Which moron hired those
Dixie Carter signed off on them.
It would have been fine with just Bischoff and Hogan
Jon rasslin'!
4Wrasslin
Oh.
4It appears there's a few fans in the fim fandom
4DAT ALLITERATION
Sooo... was Punks contract really terminated or was that another swerve within a swerve?
Be right back.
hahaha
With Vince rehired, it was just derp I'ma recreate nWo
4Punk claims that he didn't re-sign until the night of MITB
4But even that's kinda iffy
He didn't, but he was going to for sure.
Wrestling is rediculious the end
4If Punk really was leaving, there's no way Vince was gonna let Punk win AND leave with the belt
Remember his leaving RoH?
Goddamn Vince Russo, didn't they learn their lesson from WCW
/me yawns
4I can't believe Carter and Jarrett brought Russo on to TNA. Even worse, he's their head booker *shaking my head*
My only qualm is that apparently, throwing tantrums and flipping out makes you a face (Randy Orton)
Heya~
4He got over some how
It's over 8000!
Orton should be tweener, at best.
How dare...you...mock...his promo...skills...
4Even as a heel
It's because the turn wasn't done wel.
4Haha, Si
well*
D=
4I believe Orton had something going when he was a face/tweener
4But Smackdown...
4Completely obliterated his character
!
did we get to 9000?
4Y2Serious is a fucking awesome gimmick
Y2J does as well.
4Cena...Cena needs to turn
4Now
I foresee a Cena turn soon.
4He's trying everything possible to stay face, and he just comes off desperate
ARM BAR

asdfgh
ok
/me watches Die Hard on TV
03and ?
6I got sent to the hospital in an ambulance
6:|
03What
03what happened
6I had a cyst, didn't know i had one
6and it ruptured
FIGHT!
6during a huge relay walk
6I did one lap, and basically passed out
DRILL-FIGHTER
03wow
Oh dear. ._.
/me hugs
6got sent to the hospital and was there for 4 hours, going through IV, ultrasound, and dangerously low blood pressure
9actually the first mech to use a Drill
9Getter Robo
why no engilsh subtitles?
6ovarian
DubtrotMaster, no dubbing, even fandub out yet.
03Glacymr, I got my filling filled
cyst?
6which sucks, cuz those apparently are the extremely painful kind
12well
DAI-GUARD F YEAH
12your filling refilled
6and when they burst, it's somewhat of a problem
6cuz it hurts
9>recognizing Dai-Guard
12drf
9SON
9I AM PROUD
03what
12now you can tell people you got two fillings in one tooth
Dat arm
12way to sound gangster
Made me do more research
Because Dat fking arm.
6not large enough to be removed though
at least you're alright now
03LOL
._.
dmn
That ain't GUrren Lagann
03nah, the filling fell out
That was Dai-Guard
03wait, the ydidn't remove it?
6no
12people don't need to know that
6it's benign
AT ALL.
6meaning the blood tests showed it wasn't canerous
aurora...I'm sorry to hear that happened. :/
hugeass distances no affect me
well me too
6which...would have been ironic, since the relay I was walking in was a walk for cancer cure
03LOL
6it's fine
03well
6I actually took the whole thing well mentally
03I thought generally they need to remove cysts whether they're cancerous or not?
6I basically was mortified that EVERYONE in the relay saw me get removed in an ambulance
only when they're large enough
6that my friends were standing right next to me while we waited for help
6basically
6i laughed through most of this
9rule of thumb in this stream
12you know they were thinking "i knew we should have let her win"
6but aside form that
Aha
12Aurora i know the feeling
9use speedtest.net
03wait but
it's not
12with IVs
03if they don't remove them
alright
9distance has no importance when streaming via a service like Veemi
9so yeah
alright
9also makign sure you don't dl anything in the meantime
9Derma
9what did you choose?
yes?
Granteed
9Bellzelute, Granteed or Coustwell?
9oh I see
Had tried Bellzelute first time, got curbstomped in FIRST level.
Changed for the more heavier armored one.
IVs x.x
Curbstomping EVERYTHING.
12IVs aren't bad
9understandable. You probably didn't understand how to play Real Robots just yet
IVs are horrible
They are
9remember
9Real Robots are all about evasion
Because they make you pee every half hour
9and Supers are all about defense
LOL
.94Mbps
Alright
12.-.
that didn't happen to me
Though I prolly still don't know how to play well enough.
03HML
03opposed to just a shot or pills which doesn't last as long
Clears map fastest
Can take 5 enemies in their round with him alone
9man I'm hating how the stream is looking at the moment
I'd rather take pills every minute than deal with that
9give me a sec to fix quality
no problem
03LOL
Hahah
6late but
6if it was a problem, they would have removed the cyst then and there
12HyperMetalLugia
03but I mean
6but I'm going to be monitored
03how is it not ba dto have that inside you
12say that when it's 5AM and you keep getting waken up every minute to take a pill
6cysts are extremely common actually
9live again
03odd
03I've only heard of them being BAD
6because it may never grow larger, it might even go away
oh snap
mind checking if quality isn't worse now?
9quality is even worse
9btw
6benign means it's not harmful...aside from this, but otherwise not threatening
12everyone does
03LOL, reminds me of a line from Scrubs
Eventually you'll sleep
03"It looks benign" "Benign, nine and a half, something like that"
LOLwhat
9I forget
9Pilot is Asakim though
/me squicks
Just called "Stories"
It's not that bad
PHOTON BEAM?
oh wait.
that's photon beam up to 11.
Well it seemed terrible last time that happened XD
6but ugh that IV
(no microphone tonight, NewDCD?)
6my parents always joked about my fear of needles
9nope
12HyperMetalLugia
alright
9my throat feels sore
no problem.
Let it rest
12would you fall asleep then?
6but
6I got vicadin

03LOL @ shoutbox

Pill right?
6some people are immune
6but it knocks me out entirely
6yeah
12i'm surprised drf doesn't call it applebox
6but yeah, when I finally could walk again without my blood pressure dropping to threatening levels
6we went shopping
Nice way to end the day :P

6but yeah, they were like "sure she can draw, just don't mess with the iv"
6and they kept walking in like "wow you're really good lol"
We need to see Yoko actually using her gun in a SRW fight.
6problems
it hurts?
her as a fighting unit would be beyond epic.
6considering the thought of a piece of plastic tubing being in my vein made my blood pressure spike
6I HATE needles
9Dermathil
Same here >.<
9it actually happens
O_O
9as cutscenes, though
6my stepmom promised to never make fun of me again
I mean, her on the battlefield?
oh well. STILL BAMF AS AWESOME
9it was actually epic-er when Ashura did it though
Ugh, we're fighting a bunch of enemies that are trying to just run up and grapple
And I'm a halfling

12junh1024-XD, do you use imap?
yup, with gmail
12yeh I hated it too :/
12Apparently it's an IMAP thing and only in the later versions
I might not mind it, if it didn't use up more screen estate
12nope, I mean do they work at all? lol
yep
12Loads of people found the same problem
oh?
12Mine works fine.. always has.. but Xai's randomly stopped, the ONLY thing that fixed it was rolling back :/

04Heya
arti wanz to know about the peoplez here
she finds it easier if she has a photo to attatch nicknames to.

12I used to be the only Blue text person D:
12Yep :3
12And I have one brother xD
12^^
12No other siblings lol (somewhat glad XDD)
12Lol
12Do you have a photo or are you not one to share those?
04I have an elder sister. We get on each other's nerves alot.
12XD
12Speaking of that, I also study photography on the side at home
12Yep, a canon eos SLR
I have a half-broken Canon PAS
12Ah
Powershot IS720 or something
720IS
?
04I can now officially say I have a dragin plushie
04dragon*
12The fact that there’s no shaking causes the IS in the lens to vibrate causing blur
12What is IS?
12I am into photography (getting into it should i say)
12Image Stabilizer
12Is it like ISO?
12Ah
12Basically it stabilizes shacking therefore preventing blur
12It stabalises by shaking back?
12lol..
12Indeed XD
12I have premiere but I am only cutting home videos, can't be bothered with all that
12that's useful to know
12I am looking to get a good camera with a lens at some point
12Your welcome :3
12IS is a very useful tool
12DRF complains that it's bloated and it is infact.. but I prefer it too, for the reasons you mentioned
12It's something I've always used, I'm used to it
I actually use some of the bloat
inb4: it's not bloat if you use it

04o-o
/me rubs his face in Arti's floofy
04http://i56.tinypic.com/ddgle8.jpg
Keeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen
04Looks like you're saying 'keen'
12I re-enabled the popup notifications on the forums
12But, there's still no option to make it optional ovO LOL
Is it a mod, Arti?
12Yep
Hm
Which is added by an option in the profile
$_COOKIE or something
12I'd not be able to code it and I dunno how it works
Link to the mod then? :p
It kinda looks like jvascript to me though
javascript
and I'm still learning javascript
04I am lagging
04so friggin' much
04No, seriously
04TST is not loading at all.
04Or when it does, the interface is screwed over
!check lugia.us
It's just you. http://lugia.us is up.
04:/
04yes
12Better for me ^v^
12So 10pm?
and I have to try and accomodate everyone
yep
12Also, I have centered the last post thing on the forums
12Like you wanted
04argh
Oh
04Dad's gonna blame me for this
12Just applying it to the other themes
thanks
12It's ajax I think
because it looks to be in javascrip-
12and must be some php too
oh right, I forgot about ajax
yeah it's probably PHP
You shouldn't need to edit the ajax
because there'll be an event which the ajax activates which is probably handled by the PHP or at least by an if-else statement
12TST always does this to me >v<
04It
04It's like WoW, except without the roleplaying
rofl
04It's like an Xbox, only it can't play games/
04Ok I'm done
04Hey NS
instead of not eat
04What do you think of the name Incencia?
04not-Drake-like?
Try Incensia or Insencia
04Well
04What about Laveda?
Lavada?
04Well
don't talk to me about innocence
04The other two options are Kenya and Innocentia
actually I am
04XD
but hurp!
okay that was sarcasm
ahem
04Incensia looks like incense.
Hey
try Nevinost :p
04Insencia...I'm liking that
04Nevinost?
means innnocence in Croatian
04Where'd you get that?
04Uh
or innocence
04I can't imagine Spyro calling someone 'Nevinost' really/
that's innocence in english
04no durr
Inosan?
It's innocence in Haitan Creole
...Haitia
04Pronunciation?
Haitian
I-no-san
or you can use Sakleysi
04'ee-no-san' or 'eye-no-san'?
Which is icelandic
04ok now we're going too far from the norm.
Try 無罪
04All the other characters have names like 'Koray', 'Anareta', 'Irres' and 'Lia'
That's japanese
/me hides
04...
XD
or 무죄
which is korean
lmao
04Once.
04It.
04LOADS.
04Bawww I can't copy it.
04Pronunciation of both NS?
04And meanings?
Draguskyl
uskyl means innocence
they all mean innocence
/me imagines Spyro passionately moaning 'Draguskyl'
04No.
ChanServ: WHY
imagination
04XD
04Incencya is nice.
04I'll go with that
Articuno'd probably baww over me ):
/me hides
04Probably
Dragovine
Dranevine
@ Drake*
04u srs?
y not?
04BECAUSE IT'S WEIRD
salavene :p
04Salavene...
04What would be a shortened version of that?
04Sal? Sala?
or you can use Solavene
04Solavene
04Sola
04hmm
04It works, since Lia is technically the shortened version of Illia.
;p
you could use Draconis or Dragoran
/me hides
04NO
04NO
04We'll use Rathicus
/me FLEES
Sure
or use Merigal
04nonotreally
:p
I was being sarcastic
04I like Solavene
have fun
04;3
why does ice/earth
/me hides
04Because I haven't sorted out the element between those two
remind me of Combat of Giants - Dragons?
04May needs to finish that goddamn design
lol
And heh
I bet you that Solavene is just a wannabe me
and the Spyro is you
;3
04We have a severe lack of ice and earth characters
04Oh definately no
XD
04Solavene is the exact opposite of you
I'm sad
04Petite, innocent, delicate...
but i'm all of those
you insult me
04Spyro is a sarcastic smooth-talker and knows how popular he is
Then okay
I'm Spyro and you're Solavene
04...no
GENDER SWITCH, GO
gender bender hurp durp
04We'll call you Cynder and me Espen
04So I get to be an all-powerful jerkass.
BOW TO ME
/me shudders
imagination
04It hurts sometimes
yeah I know
it experiments waaaaaay too much
04Far too much
But sometimes it's interesting
04Very rarely
04So Solavene still means innocent right?
04innocent/innocence
nevine means innocent
in croatian or something
sala = salamander which is related to dragons
:p
04Ah
04nicer
04nice*
/me hugs
04Thanks
/me hugs back
04XD
but ):
04Hey I'm not dissing you
you should know full well by now that it's justified
04Of course I do
not that it needs justification but ANYWAY
Because I'm pretty...what's the word? outspoken on my philosophies :p
04Oh most certainly
you know I know I'm not pretty :p
04Stop putting me in awkward positions
04I know you're doing it intentionally
Am I that predictable? :p
04You're becoming predictable
wrong
04Stop lying. I know you're lying. I'm psychic.
I'm not lying >:
If I wanted to put you into an awkward position I would go all-out
for me it's everything or nothing :p
04[21:16] <%Ascendant> for me it's everything or nothing :p
04I'll keep that in mind
06:3
06My mind took that in the wrong AKA fun way
