I don't get a thing I'm watching

So, you're breaking the law by being here?
is he trying to get to the safe?
oh he is
so i sorta understand it
nah heavymetalpony
HeavyMetalPony: we all are.
That he did
That man is a spy
!
best song on the soundtrack is Time
by far
PWN'D
YOURS IS THE LAST BODY WE NEED TO BE REBORN. THE MAKERS MUST BE ABSORBED
Yes
Time is amazing
LEONARDO DICAPRIO IS SPY!
I prefer non-original scores
puppydog eyes
DSN: My favorite track has a spoiler in it
but koreas is faster
In all honesty, though, I'm glad The King's Speech won over Inception for best film
north or south?
Just like Across the Universe: disregard plot, aqquire awesome music.
Dream is Collapsing
um south
Nice silencer/flash supressor there.
Probably south
The Kings Speech is an epic film
love this music
Nah, Social Network whould've one, and 127 Hours was my favorite
That it is
Inception is way better then TKS
never saw TKS
I'd have wished for True Grit to get an award
15 mega bites per second
My friend...save me! Friend: Ok *shoots him in the head*
True GRit was a remake though
Lol
downlaod this movie in less teh a 1 min
But Inception and King are both incredible
*meow*
So are they all in dreamland?
the guy who plays arthur is perfect for the role
his classy vests
what is kings speech about ?
so now what? the guy woke up and his dream is collapsing?
8the casting in this movie is brilliant
Looks like killing his friend is causing the house to kill itself
Spoiler: That blank piece of paper was R.K. Maroon's will.
So glad current guy who plays Arthur plays Arthur
more like an adaptation of the same novel
LOL i've got 68 listeners XD
That it is
and now cobb somehow reads the entire document in three seconds
Shit I hear thunder, I'm gonna get a power surge soon :(
10One more, SS
/me hides
I was actually scared for this as I saw Shutter Island before Inception
XD
He may have just been looking for 1 thing
The King's Speech, Slipknot, is about exactly what it says on the tin.
King George IV ascending to the English Throne but he has a bad stutter and cannot give speeches, but he needs to deliver one for the outbreak of WWII
....
and I thought Inception was going to be as shitty as Shutter Island
Yeah talk about ensemble cast
where you at FluxBrony ?
11SLAP!
is shutter island the one about the organ farm
SPLIKNOT Florida
The King's Speech was superbly made at least
Slipknot
........
i saw this film 6 or 7 times :3
no, that's The Island
Naw, Insane Asylum
ya rain
dat slowmo
always rain in florida
It's a rather clever pun that you have to be British to fully appreciate.
even though the plot wasn't too interesting
this scene as shot in one take
Nolan-especial time
What the fuck?
LE WOOSH
I was hoping for evil conspiracy, but it's like I got mental blue balls from watching Shutter Island
Or rather, have an understanding of British culture/traditions
Titanic flashbacks, oh god
Trivial: Leonardo is reunited with his co-star: Torrents of raging water.
So that guy's get immersed in water, and then the place floods?
Drowning, not the best way to go even if you are in a dream
y'know, now that I think about it
RobotPinkie YOU MADE THE JOKE DAMMIT
no the place was his dream
every movie Dicaprio's been in, he gets his hair wet
lol u mad?
GOD, so tempted to spoil to explain plot...GRRR
although it's much less gratuitous than it used to be
RobotPinkie >(
i understand the movie on the first time through =D
2 am? heh
ya]
doesn't matter. you failed.
I love that line
sud be zzz
Yeah. I know your pain :(

I didn't take DiCaprio seriously until The Departed. Now I think he's awesome.
im there
its 10 pm in Moscow, ok
Shortround?
yeah, DiCaprio was terrible when he was playing the pretty boy
now he's really good
so both streams aren't that good for you
why is it counting down
SLIPKNOT are you FROM CHina?
He's actually listening to ponies
Wouldn't that wake him up?
19:38 in UK
FRANCH
one of my fav DiCaprio movies is Blood Diamond, which is not a technically good movie
no i live here for governemnt reaosns
You'll understand everything if you just watch the movie
Dat musoc
but he's great in it
THIS MOVIE WILL PLANT THAT SONG IN YOUR MIND.
Oh crap, a angry mob!
blood diamond was okay at best
WHERE ARE THEY!!!?

It really doesn't make any sense until you watch it twice

Random Question: Is is raining where you guys are at ?
Elky: Pales in comparison to Black Dynomite
it's cleveland, slipknot
no
well, everything does
Here it rains.
This fabric is dumb, Mister Cobb
when it's not raining it's snowing
He did it on the carpet. EWWWWWW
Was raining few minutes ago Slipknot

Fumb Dabric

that train is a spy
Dat rolling pin
I'm sofa king confused right now
Axel, you're inside the Nostalgia Critic?!
It's a good thing Cobb is a patient man.
in his mind
ok so it's the real world here
11RANDOM TOTEM TRIVIACEPTION: Cobb’s totem, a spinning top, is (probably) a reference to the Clifford D. Simak's story 'Ring Around the Sun' where the spinning top is used as a way to skip from one parallel Earth to another (by way of helping characters to concentrate).
Hey guys what do you think of Justin Bieber?

You know, if you hold your airways closed in a dream, you can still breathe. Therefore, briefly choking yourself is an easy and always availiable method of dream-checking. True facts.
or you could try to read something

I watched this for the first time at 10 pm at night in virginia i came out at midnight mind fucked
does this guy even have a name?
so this guy is trying to get secerets within dreams but he failed and now the agency is after him?
Guys...This isn't inception without MEOW.
The film was hard for me to follow the first time, but not the second
SirSprinkles, do we get meowmeowmeowmeow?
You hold your mouth and nose closed, your dream self can't do that to your real self.
Lol, he's Asian.
Does Saito get abducted by a pink haired magic girl?
Leo's face structure is weirdly young.
silverscreen, who was he in Batman Begins?
batman
the fake Rhas?
I lied.
I thought he was in The Dark Knight?
11Ken Watanabe played the decoy Rhas Al Gul in Batman Begins.
By the pink haired chick in LazyTown?
DSN: The *first* fake Rahs
Yeha
So he wants a meme
its 23 degrees celcius in beijing now

I love Saito's accent
lazytown was stupid

Dave_BroZilla: No, the Zero.
it's strong but still pretty clear
was stupid? Still is
they should have all been fat
I need to watch Begins again, I haven't seen it in a while.
Lazytown had Stephanie
11RANDOM INCEPTION TRIVIACEPTION: When explaining why he thinks implanting an idea is not possible, Arthur says "don't think about elephants" to actually make Saito think of them and thus "insert" an idea into his mind. The line is a reference to the title of a famous cognitive semantics book, 'Don't Think of an Elephant' by George Lakoff. The book describes
ah love this movie
Has anyone here ever lucid dreamed...ABOUT PONIES?!
Stephanie is annoying as hell
Hey, Silverscreen

Dicaprio has the most amazing ability to make me want to kick him in the horse apples everytime I see his face.

Legal from layton?
Elky: Nope. Especially not the Jehovah's Witnesses who have failed about 5 times.

She's like 22 or 23.
The Mayans are actually annoyed that people think they're predicting the end of the world.
she doesn't look it
yeah they're pretty pissed
yeah she looks like she's barely 19
damn interwebs
That pink square
She's just short
Tomatoes will take us over!
Yeah, she looks about 15
11RANDOM MAZE TRIVIACEPTION: When Cobbs gave Ariadne the puzzle test, Ariadne's final solution was a diagram of King Minos' Labyrinth. Ariadne is the name of King Minos' daughter in the same mythology.
and even younger in Juno because of the clothing choice
arrgh
so wanna spoil now
shes fucking hot and they're calender seem accurate
but i dont
She's 24.

68% of statistics are made up on the spot
ohai guys
I guess the sun ages people and she doesn't have too much sun.
Taylor Swift in my Inceptions?

Where are the parasprites when u need them
HOW DID I GET INTO THIS MOVIE I DONT REMEMBER WHAT THEY WERE DOING AND WHY IN THE BEGINNING
its like the fourth wall
Jon!!!!!!
Damn it Dicaprio, quit pointing out the scene transitions, breaking the fourth wall is for pink ponies!
your dreams will never be this cool
this scene was accomplished using compressed air tanks because they weren't allowed to use pyrotechnics
Pinkie!!!!!!!!
I'm still mad that Will Smith didn't become Neo in the Matrix. That would've made it a landmark black movie.

Spoiler: Rarity is a Zebra with white on white stripes.
Axel_Foaley: When I heard about that I got so dissapointed, Will Smith would have been an awesome Neo.
HeavyMetalPony ITS NOT TRUE
they seem real while you're in them
AAAAAPLEOOSA I seriously don't do that either.... because I didn't really follow it once it got confusing.
wtf is that real 5 min is an hour ?
slipknot: not realy
no
I had a dream a few nights ago that my hair was blue like my ponysona, lol
hmmm
there is SOME time perception difference
out of all my dreams, only 1% of them are realistic
11RANDOM ARIADNE TRIVIACEPTION: Ariadne, in Greek mythology, was the daughter of King Minos of Crete and his queen, Pasiphaë. She aided Theseus in overcoming the Minotaur by giving him a ball of red fleece thread that she was spinning, so that he could find his way out of the Minotaur's labyrinth. The name is also a reference to Hugo von Hofmannsthal's setting
11of the myth for Richard Strauss's opera Ariadne auf Naxos. The opera is a play within a play, just as the movie is a dream within a dream.
ahh, gotta love mad up movie facts
FluxBrony, but do you even remeber how it became good? It just appeared good out of nowhere.
but it's not really quantifiable
in reality, the amount of time that exists in your dream varies due to the nature of the dream
The whole "brain uses only a fraction of its capacity" thing is not true, and neither is anything based on it.
well...
HeavyMetalPony.....my God....
8BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRM

TIME PARADOX
Great Scot!
Dwarf Fortress?
Uwe Boll is directing the Mass Effect movie? D:
Uwe Boll has gotten better. Now his movie are just "plain" bad.
11RANDOM ARTHUR TRIVIA: The "Penrose stairs" (with a woman perpetually picking up papers) that Arthur shows Ariadne is a reference to a lithograph print by the Dutch graphic artist M.C. Escher. The print is usually called "Ascending and Descending" or "The Infinite Staircase", and was first printed in March 1960; Escher is well-known for his drawings exploring
11optical illusions and real architectural, mathematical, and philosophical principles rendered in fantastical ways.

SNAKE!SNAKE!SNAAAAAAAKE!
I's like to see that

YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE DREAM! YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IT!
SNAKE!YO,SNAKE!SNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKE!
Escher, bitches.
im gonna go in ten min eyes starting to close
THIS SENTENSE IS FALSE
11Uwe Bolle does a World of Warcraft movie. He's found dead a week later.
MGS movie?
you can't make a movie about an MMO
or a racing game
You can
Uwe Boll and Metal Gear Solid would be a good fit. The in-game cutscenes are about Uwe Boll quality in terms of acting :-p

11RANDOM YUSUF TRIVIACEPTION: "Yusuf" is the Arabic form of "Joseph", the Biblical figure from Genesis 37-50, who had the gift of interpreting dreams. He was sold out by his brothers to slavery. Through his gift of dream interpretation he helped Pharaoh to prepare for the disaster of the "seven lean years" and was rewarded as a result.
11The same story is also told in the Koran.

Darf14 Indeed...
Oh I love my coat of many colours
03surgeons are doctors, yes?
03so why not dentists
12no
anon, time is slowed down remember
Dat black guy

hey heavymetalpony go on fb gotta tell u something
12hahaha you said apple
dat foreshadowing
I am
ok
WE DONT KNOW IF HE'S DREAMING NOW
those curtains
ASDF
And each layer is a new 5 -> 60 transition.
were the same as the hotel's
DUN DUN DUUUN
ok, phew!
*gasp* he's still dreaming
and now that scene is gone
never to return
Hmm...I wonder if I am dreaming right now *spins top*: http://www.notcot.com/images/2010/08/96x96_01_Inception_Top.gif
Mr Fish
03no I didn't
He's still in a dream SNAKE EEATERRRRRR
Dat namedrop
Oh, so this movie involves Wal Mart.
I don't get why friction doesn't work on the spinner in dreams.
who plays Fischer Sr.? I know I've seen him before
12within the last 10 years you have
it's not friction, winstonchurchill, it's a matter of gravity
because it's a custom top the dreamer doesn't know the weight
#silvershipper is so lonely
Fischer Sr. was in Clash of the Titans
so it goes forever
He's The Scarecrow DSNesmith, right?
no, Cillian Murphy is Fischer Jr.
my brain hurts
so Saito is Ras al Ghul from Batman beings... isnt Fisher the Scarecrow from the same movie?
I'm wondering about his dad
mfw that channel
good it works today
i need something simple minded
This movie does mess with your mind
Fischer Sr., the old sick guy, I've seen him in other stuff
GET MAD
02bacl
It is both gravity and friction. Friction slows the top so gravity can pull it down.
02back*
My top is not stopping, see you guys in reality *bang*
winston, that's not the reason it doesn't fall though
I hate movies with this much fluctuation between the quiet and loud parts.
That's why we have b movies, LoneWolf
friction does not exist in the dream world
in the dream, the dreamer doesn't know how long the top will take to fall
so it never does
now, if the owner of the totem
was the dreamer
it would fall like normal
Impera...imperawha?
your totem only tells you if you're in someone ELSE'S dream
important!
IMPORTANT
Brink?
The Buzzards are buzzing
preca...what?
HEY GUYS IT IS THREE AM HERE AND I MUST SLEEP NOW SO THANKS FOR THE MOVIE , ENJOY THE REST AND SEE YOU ALL LATER
Phew, the bullet missed
night slipknot

SOMEPONY ELSE'S DREAM?I WANT MY MONEY BACK!
11RANDOM ACTOR TRIVIA: A good portion of the cast in Inception also appeared in previous Nolan film, Batman Begins and Dark Knight. Saito was the Decoy Rhas Al Gule, Fischer was Scarecrow, and Michael Caine as Albert.
ya
goodnight
bye slipknot
Ciao, Slipknot.
come back, soon
Take care, Slipknot
BYE SLIPKNOT, NICE MEETING YOU
Recommend watching inception twice
I'm sure this will be important later
Have a good night.
BAI
OKAY GOOD NIGHT THEN
G'night. See you later.
Albert?
Alfred, silly :P
See ya, Slipknot
is she making her totem?
thanks guys
WHY ARE YOU STANDING AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM THOUGH
your sarcasm in response to my condescension is bullshit.
well that answers my question
notice how her chess piece falls straight and doesn't roll
It's a chess piece
"experiments"
she's weighted it uniquely
Like it does now.
meaning only she knows how it should react
23.6 grams. That is unique.
note cobb can actually tell her how his works and still have it work
dat 23.6 grams
hospital, doesn't she mean hospitable?
because she's never actually seen it spun
But what if she becomes a body builder and 23.6 grams feels different?
In other words, he doesn't want to use game faqs to solve a maze
lol
Gamefaqs doesn't have time for your petty mazes!
But i did
inb4 first 'one thing you need to know about me'
Mol can use cheat codes.
he leo struts away
lol
I don't get it... how does a bishop represent that?
^
Priest
wouldn't a pawn lead the way?
That.
Leader
...?
religious leader
or a knight
Exactly.
this is psychology
^
lol
11Bishop is a priest. A religious leader.
yes
or a queen
I know that
Its because adrianec can only walk diagonally
You must connect with the Lord, and HALLELUJAH
tbh that makes no sense at all
Bishop is a religious leader (specifically, the rank above priest in the Catholic Hierarchy)
specificity?
Religious leaders are not very good leaders
wouldn't a queen make more sense?
queens can't move unless all the others infront move
Does that mean that Cobb's totem represents that he's living on temporarily, and at any point he could fall?
Boogidy boogidy boogidy amen?
Talledega Nights?
I'd go with a knight for a totem.
I will never again complain about title drops in FiM.
11WinstonChurchil: That's a good one.
*bitchslap*
Dark Knight?
booga booga booga booga
What's up with the die totem that one dude has?
lol celestia would be so cofused solar flares would come out of her cutie mark!
If the the bishop is the leader then in the game of chess why doesn't the game end when one of the bishops is killed
Dee_Twenty that
loaded die
always falls on one side
in someone else's dream
My Totem is a toenail clipper.
it would fall randomly
Protip: Don't drink free airplane champegne before an incpetion mission
Stupid loaded dice!
The king is just a figurehead in chess
but how would he find out?
That makes no sense. ._.
see only he knows which way it's loaded
If I clip my toenail that the nail hits my eye, I know I'm still dreaming.
Darf14: It's a reference to the position it's based on.
a dreamer wouldn't know that
(The brain capacity thing)
and the die would fall based on THEIR physics
11...you are looking into the whole Bishop thing too much.
Nopony else than him knows on which side that loaded dice has to land.
lol he dreams of boats and hoes 4 ten years
hence, it would fall randomly
a loaded dice doesn't have a 100% chance to land on one side
8dreaming about ponies for 10 years
Depends what the dream is about.
Also, Bishops often lead the charge (along with knights) in a chess game.
8WANT
haha, wait, was that supposed to be a joke?
Do i just leave or how does this work
me too
Hipster_Brony: For once I concur.
Of course, I am looking way too deep into the bishop thing
especially if i was a pegasus
Hipster_Brony agree
I could dream with that
I wouldn't mind dreaming about ponies for 10 years
dat jump
... I dunno. Ten years in Ponyville would probably seriously screw me up.
same
You can just customize is.
lol Slipknot, you can just leave, nothing will happen to stream
Dat Piaf again
ah ok lol
cuz he's a chemist and chemists can do that
you'd come out of the dream and try to exist on a diet of cupcakes and grass
I'd probably have reality shock after 10 years in my dreams too
her voice got deep
Lol 1 year in Ponyville then Celestia and then 9 Years on moon :D
lul
lol they haven't shown fall weather frinds on the hub in a while
My dreams are generally awesome :P
11"I bought the airline. It seemed...neater." lol
03LOL
slipknot: you have to die to get out of the stream
DragonRage: It would be longer than that in the dream if 5 real minutes = 1 hour in the dream.
Holy shit, 10 year pony dream. DO WANT
SCREW PLANNING I HAVE MONEY
Elky lol
My dreams are weird
8i got that bitch an airline
Elky: hahaha ya i already did
8bitches love airlines
bitches love airlines?
Kaiba's hero right there.
HeavyMetalPony, imagine waking up after 10 years in a dream though
SCREW THE DREAMS I HAVE MONEY.
sometimes I dream about cheese
Dreams are never as cohesive as in movies
Agreed.
12that is his home
Neater in two ways.
Now to invade his sexeh dream time
11"In trying to write a team-based creative process, I wrote the one I know," said Nolan.
10 year pony dream? It would be easier to just take LSD.
it would crush you to know nothing you did was real after 10 years in the world
what if you were in a lucid dream?
12:P
Tell me about it, a041744.
i never dream about ponies in real life
maybe your dreams aren't
i wish i did
they probably got dared to make a movie more confusing than the matrix
12where do you go before work?
these ARE lucid dreams
12or school
I've yet to lucid dream
Yeah, but... it's ponies... even if I did end up like the Sloth victim in Se7en
If I could understand even one of my dreams, I'd be convinced I'm actually having them.
aren't most dreams somewhat pr0n?
03s6till
the matrix....confusing?....what...?
Man this girl is nosy
03that wasn't on the board
More often than not I just forget them in a daze and/or take a shower if necessary.
i want to have a lucid dream
What would happen if they entered an abstract dream?
Anytime I become aware of it being a dream, I jolt out.
By the time I'm aware that I'm dreaming, I wake up.
12hmm
what if it was a sexy dream and someone else just hopped in
11OHSHI-!
Best trivia yet, Silverscreen. Didn't know the movie was THAT meta
K its not that confusing, just to Neo
NO
i jumped
I jumped
Gunshot?
dat herdmind
ok bye now
In dreams random things happen, stuff doesn't connect when you really think about, stuff just happens and you accept it.
life is a beach
gunshot? or musical stinger?
dat teleport
This scene is so freaking creative
Later Slipknot
Combustiblelemons Ever watched that Family Guy episode where they go to a bunch of different universes?
dat beach
Because dreams entertain us you silly girl
Like that, but weirder.
yes I have- ohhhh
BECAUSE INCEPTION BITCH
@Frubban:I saw that episode monday!
he's a mod lol
although i probably would wake up because pinkie would break my dream
Don't go to /b/!
dreams are not biologically important, but they do play a nice role in the thought process. Sleep in and of itself is good though
he gets to use colors, i mean memories
I am... a /b/tard.
it is a silly place
lol, that's awesome
"I can't act."
It's dreams, I aint gonna explain shit
Frubban i lovedc that episode
floor /b/ only leads to insanity!
ever wonder what happens if you hit the ground in falling dreams?
"I am a pedophile"
you wake up?
he's digging his hooves at the ground!
Dreaming has several different potential explanations. Some psychologists think of it as "static", for example.
it's zecora
also, I heard he eats hay
Welcome to /b/! Here is your complimentary 11-year old and soda!
@silverscreen where are you getting those?
what the heck i wsn't expecting that
i eat hay too
Dam girl, stop getting into his personal life, what do you think you are his wife?!
I eat hay.You eat hay.We ALL eat hay!

OH NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Sorry cobb, off to go explore your mind
No Mrs. Page, don't do it. You'll become one of them! D:
So Nolan ended up with a woman who's half the height of the rest of the cast.

4I'm guessing Fischer and Cobb's crew are bending and molding this projection of his godfather to fit their needs
It's hard to follow first time round
dusk_fly, actually
those lazy, lazy writers
11Try watching this movie through Fischer's POV. It's just as epic.
watch it again
they just planted the idea
Fischer's filling in the blanks himself
I didn't it was that complicated...
that's what I'm doing right now :P
Mister Fischer used Fissure. It's a One hit KO.
Well i'm leaving now if anyone cares. Which they don't... oh well.
Not really.

4But Browning would never have said that unless they planted it there
they didn't plant the words
Ciao, Timmymonsta.

They're molding Fischer's thoughts, to alter how the projection of Browning acts.

*MGS theme plays*
4Exactly, had not Cobb and his crew done what was necessary, Browning would never have said those things
they're affecting Fischer, who changes his projection of Browning to fit the ideas they make
It's layers of lies, half-truths, and manipulations.

11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The film has around 500 visual effect shots.
Level 2, Barry.
facehoof
TRIVIACEPTION: The kid from the vomiting bed scene was played by a young Johnny Depp.
one thing I love about Nolan films is how little CGI they use
We're in level 3.-.
in other words?

i've noticed no one has used gilda's percentage (100%)
Whoops. Haven't been paying enough attention I guess.

That bridge is so over used in movies
on the bridge is head of security
wait is Mai Waifu on?
4I just read that Joseph Gordon-Levitt will play a character in The Dark Knight Rises. Nolan really does enjoy recasting the people he's worked with before
TRIVIACEPTION: Johnny Depp returned in Freddy's Dead to be slammed in the face by Freddy's frying pan
>implying 3D doesn't distract from the storytelling experience of every movie4
RAINBRODASH!
dusk_fly: Most directors due
Vaugns gonna jump over that bridge! one little slip and CHOMP CHOMP CHOMP!

And holy shit I can't type today. due = do

remember this guy's face

The guy who plays Fischer Jr. is in an upcoming movie called In Time
11dusk_fly: Most directors like to work with Actors that they know work well. Tim Burton does the same with Johnny Depp
They're only 3 levels in.
*mgs alert music plays*
level 4 of this dream is ponyville
and hes gone
similar to Logan's run, the aging gene has been permanently turned off
/me ninjaed a mod! yay!
Dat music.
The 4th level is the stranges
.... the aging gene? -.o
And level 5 is Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.
And time becomes money
yay!
literally
And level 6 is Hel
brass booms
THe wealthy can live forever
*Hell
2 SOON!
Nah, I like the idea of level 6 being the Norse goddess of the dead.
but you have to buy your time as working class
I thought in Logans run people still got old by were "renewed" when they hit 30 and get born again?
It's like they can have a bridge in a movie unless it's termnal island bridges.
After 100 years as a pony, they go back to being human in the real world.
It's a similar idea
Nolan's the man
The director for In Time is the same one who did Gattaca
I liked Gattaca
I never liked this scene. It's too military-y
Eames kill-count: 2
lol we watched gattaca in bio
But it's based on overpopulation and how to deal with it
Eames kill-count: 3
yeah, I kinda glaze over for this scene
Gattaca was a great movie
Eames kills a lot of stuff
gattaca was fun
11Razyn: Better than the Bay films were 75% of the movie is Military-focused.
but they aren't even characters
But we all dream about guns.
they're literally just projections
It's really interesting, I advise all of you to look up the trailer, or even if we can show it in the post-show following killer tomatoes
oh right- did I miss the lottery?
my teacher said they were doing twister on the ceiling in that one scene

11and while still in kindergarten, Lukas Haas made his film debut in Testament.
Eames kill-count: 7
cause she didn't inhabit it anymore
brb, gonn confirm
why has nopony thought of using the moon as a weapon?
4Now, Cobb and crew believe they have around 20 minutes or so since the van went over.
Pit Pony?
Lol, Pit Pony
convenient brozilla
dusk_fly, I don't think that the time dilation is linear, I'm pretty sure it's exponential
@LoneWolf414 three days....three days....
the water tribe uses it as a weapon kinda
4 times 12 times 12 = 576 seconds, 9.6 minutes. So it's actually 8 seconds for the truck
three days?
Majora's Mask already did.
something's going on with the US government... they're hiding something.
Axel got it :P
this guy
that arthur's choking
Each minute in real time is 12 in level 1
Looks like he is in SPAAAAAACCEEEEE!
*gets abducted*
was the same projection shooting at Yussef from the bridge
Fancy mathematics...
Those 12 stretch to 144 in level 2
3 Days for Majora's Masck, 7 days for the ring
inb4 epic fail
4Which means that the dream within the dream, the deeper level, is simulating real life time while the upper level is simulating dream time since time in sleep is exponentially much faster than real time
Eames kill-count: 8
Um, it's 20 times....
Darf14, are you space?
5 : 60 is 1:12
1man hug
WEEEEEEEEE
gotta go to space
5 minutes is 1 hour, remember?
USE YOUR FANCY MATHEMATHICS!
it's not 5:60
that was without Yussef's special formula
lol still falling
6It's not x12 for this mix though.
Ah, right.
6This mix is x20.
hey, how long until this ends?
Yusuf's formula changed it.
2 days left
Forgot that plot point.
Yeah. x20.
Indeed.
11remember, the time given is compounded.
or 30 minutes
nice sniping there
Curiousity killed the Pippin. . .
the kraby patty formula changed it
of course considering it is an experimental formula
we should give them SOME leeway
So 1 minute in reality is 20 in level 1, 400 in level 2, and 8000 in level 3
/me 6tests out Cogs.
efficiency
11 5 minutes = 2 hours on 3rd leve.
4All I'm saying is that, minus other factors, the dream is actually real life while what we believe to be real life is actually just a dream
The ring = 7 days, LOZ: MM = 3 Days, Half Minute Hero = 30 seconds

Poika!

I believe I see the big tweest at the end
I don't like how he didn't go for the headshot
omg is the bullet ok?
now see, pay attention
I like how he bitches everyone else about unprofessionalism, but yet every dream level somehow manages to screw them over even more :P
He can't because of who she is.
do we have the list for the lottery ready?
Fisher dies
I believe to have figured out at least one tweest
somepony needs to hit refresh
so he goes to limbo but not lucidly
Sucks that he got shot twice
wall mounted defib?
bum BUM BUUUMMMM!!!
Defibrillator here!
22 Navy SEALS from Unit 6, responsible for killing Osama Bin laden, were shot down by enemy forces while travelling in a NATO helicopter
Not just failed, failed spectacularly.
Fission Mailed!
actually wall mounted AEDs are pretty common
its a dream remember
Dun dun DUUUUUUUUUUN!
Eames isn't even mad.
But it was all Cobb's fualt
dfghjk
Hey tough guy! heal up!
AMAREICA AMAREICA
U jelly Fisher?
now, that said
ride the kick back up layers, maaaaaaaaaan
quit whining tis only a flesh wound
Defibrillator =/= the breath of life
OK Smarty pants, but can you spell brink?
WE NEED TO GO DEEPER
well
4I wanna go deeper into Ellen Page
favorite score track :D
now pay attention, they go to limbo with the dream machine
so they go down lucidly
Stage 4?! U MAD GIRL!!!
in terms of pure kick stuff
lold
she looks 12
the prestige deserves way more recognition
they know they're dreaming
11Dusk_Fly: Giggity
Defibrillator heals bullet wounds!
U mad Dream world?
BRRRRRRRRRRRRRM
*scratches head*
6Level 4 = automatic limbo?
6Wat?
my chat is not showing ythingan
I mean, it has Tesla! The internet should be all over it.
so um did they just happen to bring seditives to go down a 4th level?
minecraft graphics got upgraded
i want the world to collapse!
4Level 4 is Limbo
Dream Difibulator is a miracle worker
WITH OR WITHOUT YOU
I can't find Drought Vulpix in Dream World.
it will look epic
SirSprinkles, Limbo isn't level 4, it's level N+1
THe electricity would bring him back just enough for the kick to work right?
level 4 is Fisher's mind, and he was shot into limbo
N is 3 in this case
Everybody Limbo!
Just wondering
LIMBO!WOO!
Welcome to the OMFGWTF?!?! stage
level 5 = Equestria
is dealerwealer here? cuz he's awesome
water
see limbo is unconstructed dreamspace
/me limbos
Dman?
Instant soundtrack just add BWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG
they constructed 3 levels
*cue laughter*
Oh hai blatant excuse to have a "hot" girl in soaking wet clothes.
so the next level down is limbo
yeah what would level 5 be?
BWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG
Level 6 - Hogwarts
2012?
if they only made two levels, level 3 would be limbo
4All these levels...starting to remind me of Eversion
0limbos
the whole level construction reminds me of Night Watch
yay collapse
Level 6 = titanic?
No, Equestria is the final level.
anyone read that?
4THEY EVERTED TO LEVEL 4
We have to see 2012 for BMN.
ok so the city is memorys, what'sthe water represent/
Final boss: Trollestia
Limbo is default map.
7oh hell no
7 2012 >.,
Level 7 - Middle Earth
they only constructed 3 levels, so the 4th would be unconstructed = limbo
Level 8 is when they finally get to reality, then?
and now Eames switches on God Mode and kills a lot of people
XD jk sathi
No more BWOOOOONG allowed DiCaprio!
Saito I need you to not bleed out okay?
4No
That would make a decent new year's special, Lemons
4Level 8 is China
LEvel 8 - Dragonball Z area
And shoot some bitches too.
I like the idea of 2012
level 7 chicago and stookersturm zepplin
what if it was an infinite loop
4They went so deep, they ended up in China
level 9 = FINAL BOSS
seriously why is everything destroyed in level 4?
I don't have a clue what he is doing in the hotel.
I thought Level 8 was the Valley of Bowser
>2012
I just thought how cool it would be if S2 had an ep similar to Inception
chat is acting weird today
Level 8-4 is the final boss
Level 10 - Kanto Region
it's all that Cobb remembers from his time in Limbo
god no
They have to be in a coma to get that deep though
Its been a long time sense anyone been to limbo
dftyuiop
4@LoneWolf414: Because it's deteriorating
therefore time took over
He hasn't been at that level for a whilw.
7weird in what way?
limbo was built hundreds of years ago by cobb and mal
Dream magic
4No one's been around to take care of it
*while
There can't be a level 10
Level 5 is Equestria
4So it fell apart
ponies and inception? do not want
0level 11 - Whoville
Level 9 is the final boss.
dusk_fly that makes sense
Of course there is
note that until Cobb got down here
Drab grey buildings. What an imagination.
Ponies and Pokemon
level 10 is actually level 11
when it was just Fischer
they'res no way that can be right!
It's only logical
it was just the beach
but as soon as Cobb gets down there
Floor 13?
it takes on his memory of it
INCEPTION!Y U CONFUSE US?!
looks like a dump to me
digging for worms at a sidewalk
He can climb rope using only his hands
Cobb became Notch later
Remember theres no gravity
He built Hiroshima?
apokafish
0Floor 13 is Warehouse 13
Therefore pulling yourself up is easier
yes
I thought he built Albany
Dude, he has a lot of houses

Including cats.
cept rebecca black
Ohshi- did we miss our kick?
Dang, I left sometime during last night and came back, I might have missed it
... and yeah, that was about the point where the movie went crazy.
/me yawns
Yeah, so remember the part where you said this movie was LESS pretentious than the Matrix? You lied like a rug.
HEAR!
Also, people not here for friday you missed NewDCD wearing a shoe again.
12:<
Did I miss Killer Tomatoes?
So when you die, you into Limbo?
/me yawns
11We were watching Inception when a cat ad appeared on DCD's comp, meowing loudly over the stream.
this movie's not pretentious, it lays all the answers out for you
That girl looks like someone from Pleasantville.
lolno, Tacowiz
/me yawn loudest
D: I...I missed that?
4Ahahahaha
We're still stuck in limbo, shit
again?
*s
No, I mean die in real life.
you did yes.
whal ethe library was closing
fail XD
Did I miss the lottery?
12xD
No
nope
Ads with sound ftl
Yeah I missed inception and came back for rotten tomatoes, DAM YOU FAMILY PROBLEMS!
4Inception takes The Matrix's idea of perception and reality and KICKS IT UP X10
and this is the big plot of the movie: Cobb actually is responsible for killing his wife
no, you might still get a pick
her lie was his reality
And thanks for the explanation, Silverscreen. I was visiting family on Friday, so couldn't be here :(
at the end of the movie is when the lottery occurs young skywalker
dusk_fly: Over 9000?
/me dsdfgysdfgfgh
I have already planted the idea within this chat that I will win, though.
i did it to her
Bitch capped herself in Level 0, but she thinks that level 4 is Real Life?
Killer Tomatoes is one of the so-bad-it's-good legends, Darf14. Inception is too serious for a chat room screening.
4Pretty much, Espy
/me yawns louder
Wow, Ramona Flowers has a great performance in this movie.
Agent Smith > Cobol Engineering.
Something wrong, Pizzapony?
that beauty mark on her head is really distracting
Ramona Flowers?WHERE?
She went to level -1 after that.
lol no rollerblades
Someday Spider's Web will be a so-bad-it's-good legend.
4Ramona Flowers isn't in this movie
I mean Killer Tomatoes *facehoof*
4This isn't Scott Pilgrim
Minus dream world.
Pleas stop Tacowiz
0so how does the lottery work?
4Nor is it the latest Die Hard film
In before kick.
inception works surprisingly well
@cronoflash they take all the names in chat and put it in a selection thing
It just works
the reason they use a train
like inception fuggetaboutit!
floor 1 time
/me yawns wider
is so that it kills them both simultaneously
but I look forward to killer tomatoes more
CHOO CHOO
Idea: Ship it under the name Inception.
0@nah thanks
he wasn't sure she'd do it if he did
/me yawns some more
running on a rail
THOMAS NO
Imma back
/me yawns longer
absolute best reason to buy a safe, put ur tops in it
he tampered with her totem?
I've watched killer tomatoes before. It is awesome
dusk_fly: Damn it, stop reminding me of movies I'd rather be watching.
i like trains
look out for the stealth train!
wtf? That train wasn't being pulled by ponies?
:P
4Dee_Twenty: The film's almost over
Scott Pilgrim should be next week
Le SPLAT
JESUS!
Faces of Death 3
Dreams are cancer, heck what doesn't cause it these days

It's almost tomato time.
Scott Pilgrim was suggested once and rejected

OOHWWWHHHHHH NAAOOOUUUGH

That was me
It's always suggested
Dee_Twenty man your constant bitching is annoying
UMAD LEO?
Ignaesia: Why was Scott Pilgrim rejected? That movie's awesome.
So that's why the train? Holy shit.
Why was it rejected, Ignaesia?
Press E to bleed out.

JE RIGRETTE RIEEEEEN
MEOWkick
Matt: Ghosties got his turn last week, this week it's my turn to find the movie repugnant. When we show a movie you hate you can have your turn.
It did get rejected one week
inb4 magic AED
Tacowiz, he means someone said we should watch it but it was never picked
11Scott Pilgrim as never suggested as far as I know.
I've never seen SP, but really want to
he dead.
How is Scott Pilgrim a "B" movie, its fucking awesome
Magic Aed go.
L4D'D
L4D?WHERE?
4Dee can bitch about the movie if he wants to, it's his right
wait, did you guys already do the lottery?
11The only film we've ever rejected was someone asking for South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut for A movie.
uhh...yeah....some dumb person thought it was a B movie....yeah
DragonRage has been here since week three, I think. Never saw Scott Pilgrim get suggested.
Why?
Whoops, missed the whole for the grenade
b movie must be wicker man
hole*
Guys
>mfw someone who doesn't know what movie to pick get to choose the movie.
at the end of the movie is when the lottery occurs young skywalker
it did someone suggested it and it was turned down in favour of Battlefield Earth I think?
We need to find Saito in a hero closet.
i never said he couldn't I just said it was annoying
Zappity zap zap
ugh
Anyone know where that is?
we could have watched SP instead of BE?
D:
Eeyup
I know what B movie to pick... so... inb4 I win A movie pick?
4Like I said, Scott Pilgrim is by no means a B film
right
Scott Pilgrim is very much A.
I wonder what Superbad would be
4Probably A
A movie
Both?
I'd suggest Serenity, myself.
4Superbad wasn't a b movie at all
Superbad is A
Well Scott Pilgrim did kind of bomb at the box office.
/me 11has a list of really bad B-movies to chose.
All of edgar Wrights films are A
Fantastic Adventures of Unico?
Id put Scott Pilgrim as a B but you know
Superbad is one of my favourite movies
But the wiipedia page classifies a cult movie as a type of B movie
ouch, she just stabbed him in the chest
DICAPRIO!Y U STARTLE THE WITCH?!
lol
Especially the dick drawings part
Tropic Thunder is an A movie.
Silverscreen If Rocky Horror is on that list, I will murder you.
What about Deathproof, dusk_fly?
im alive!
Tropic thunder is so good
Bryan lee omalley diid work on those graphic novels
What are "arty" independant films generally considered to be? B, I'm guessing? But what if they have a decent budget?
Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy- A or B movie
I wish Rocky Horror had the budget to be an A movie.
11Tacowiz: Rocky Horror isn't a bad movie, but it's on my B-movie list.
whut do u mean U PEEPLE?
Is Office Space considered B?
4Rocky Horror is most certainly a B film
oh no
Dat buildup
it's this scene
oh yes
I... I won't cry
4Deathproof?
Fritz The Cat is barely a B movie and only because it's been forgotten.
4Not sure
EVERYONE STFU AND PAY ATTENTION HERE
;_;
razyn: Planet terror counts as b, so death proof should too
timed explosives to excelrate an elevator?
*Hugs DSN*I'm here for you bro.
11Hichhiker's guide is a comedy movie, but it's neither bad nore low-budget, so it qualifies for both A and B movie.
rocket elevator!
Man, when did B-Movie become synonymous with "bad movie"?
MEow
here is the kick
Manly tears are okay
Rocky Horror WOULD have been an A-Movie,but it bombed at the box-office.
That's what I was thinking, Elky
Seriously. What is he doing in the hotel?

/me HYPER YAAAAAAWNS

Is Airplane considered A or B?
XD
Speed Racer is a B movie because it's a terrible movie.
that music cue
Personally I don't consider it a B movie when it's INTENTIONALLY so bad it's good like Rocky Horror.

You guys really complicated the A movie and B movie thing. It's basically all about oppinion

From here on out...I'm lost
Ariadne and Fischer kick out
Apokalipse,do you mean the original?
have any of the Python movies been "A" movies yet?
The original
Silverscreen, do you still stand by this statement I copypasted fro weeks ago? "In Brony State, anything that's Overly Comedic, A Parody, A cult film, or low-budget, it qualifies as a B-movie."
0This is still inception right?
Apokalipse: WHICH Piranha? There's like three different versions.
just Holy Grail
oh nvm too much chat
I'll explain later
yes
At least all movie trailers have the same score thank to inception.

I've no idea what the actual criteria is for A vs B movie
Needs more Life of Brian
Razyn under those circumstances, SP is a B movie as its cult, right?
4Don't worry about it, DSNesmith. Right here was where I got incredibly pissed at the film last night
lol the police troll in the end of the holy grail
11Hitchhiker's Guide, for example, is a big budget movie, but since it's overly comedic, it qualifies as either A or B.
so can a good movie that's a cult film be up for B? Like A Clockwork Orange or Brazil?
I hear people say 'budget' but I never see an actual definition.
How long until the lottery?
I demand Life of Brian some time
short version: everyone kicks up to level 1, saito is still in limbo, cobb bleeds out in limbo, rises up to level 1, drowns in car, goes back to limbo, saito shoots him and himself, they all wake up on the plane
No it shouldn't qualify as A or B *head explodes*
I have LIfe of Brian, I think I'd rather suggest Meaning of Life for a Python movie.
The Great Mouse Detective - Critical success, technically a commercial failure
A or B movie
Ignaesia, Yes. I believe so.
Dam stream, work right for me
Life of brian is one of the best monty python movies of all time
Which is what I'm choosing if/when I win the lotto today
Actually, the Asylum mockbuster for Piranha 3D was BETTER than the actual Piranha 3D if you ask me, at least the giant piranhas were actually the focus of the movie instead of boobs.
OF ALL TIME
But GMD has VIncent Price so it's automatically A
lol Ihate the romans how much? A LOT
I've wondered the same thing about The Secret of NIMN, Dave.
4Why haven't they woken up yet is the big question
Rescuers Down Under is a... ... A movie.
Apokialipse: if it's neither A nor B, what is it? C?
Out of all 3 of them
11The Great Mouse Detective....personally an A movie, but not exaCTLY SURE.
we need a Mel Brooks film for the A movie sometime
Man, so many good choices. =/
y u hate me
Damn, there are lots of good animated movies involving mice.
It's A
I always get lost in this part
I'm not sure what I'd choose if I get picked
awwww, I remember that movie
I used to watch it a lot when I was younger
6Dat full circle
4We return to the beginning
We already had Young Frank N Stein.
GMD is my favourite movie of all time, hell I wore out the VHS tape pretty much watching it so often
dusk_fly
4I see the plot twist
lol
Piranha 3D is a BAD movie.And i mean BAAAAAD.
So, he's still on the 4th level here?
okay get this
deja vu anypony?
Did he just say Godzilla?
I don't know if this is a flashback or a dream
or what level is he on now?
I mean, I always got the impression that A vs B movie made no indication on if it was actually worth watching.
/me is now nostalgic for the existence of VHSs
there should be a list on Bronystate with all previous A and B movie selections
we need to watch blazing saddles
He is in limbo now
this part confuses me.
Framed narratives make either less sense in movies or more. There is no mid-ground
oh ok
Why?
The beginning was a flashforward. All of the movie was building up to this scene.
THis is a dream, they're in Limbo
what loon said
Definately, RainbowLoon.
Piranha 3D is hilarious and entertaining...and one of my favorite films of all time
Darken YES
saito doesn't know it's a dream because he died and went to limbo, Cobb died in limbo and went back to level one, then drowned in the van, then goes to limbo, and because he died, he doesn't know he's dreaming
Saito's totem reminds him he is
RainbowLoon I'm liking this idea
he reminds saito that it's a dream
saito shoots them both
they all wake up
11RainbowLoon: I have a complete list of BMN history. Minus the pony episodes watched.
Pegacorn: Agreed, it should have been called Girls Gone Wild: College Snuff Edition instead, the boobs had more screen time than the fish.
4The beginning did one of those things the director of Pulp Fiction does
Piranha 3DD has lifeguard David Hasselhoff
I like Saito's limbo
ahh ok
but wouldn't killing themselves send them down another level?
silverscreen: can you convince dari to upload it?
alright guys look here i got this figured out
@Silverscreen sometime you should post that, it might be handy to keep track of
Okay, but four kicks, three moves for Aignre or whatever she's called. Explain or Cobb has bad ending.
no
ride trhe hasslehoff!
limbo is it
pay attention to his left hand
So this whole movie was one massive dream sequence?
4THERE WE GO
Best music of the film here
there is no lower level
Not from Limbo
Nope
David Hasselhoff?DO WANT.
Now, is the old guy Old Saito or Old Cobb?
Killing themselves here would wake them up
Silverscreen: but is it available to everyone on the site to look at?
How the heck did he get out of limbo
saito shot him, darf14
Limbo automatically boots you to level 1
Limbo is the lowest you can go.
They killed each other
if you kill yourself in limbo, you wake up
period
Halo annocer:Suicide!
the power of friendship
4Cobb told Saito in the first dream that he'd be an old man in Limbo
but guys look watch pay attention to cobb's left hand
So now, old man Saito will be young again? how horrible.
lol limbo is lowest
pew pew thats how
@_0
Then why were they so worried about limbo anyways?
Success!
Best song in the movie
Jon: or betrayal?
4Basically, everything was a dream
immigration!
this music is so good
is this the track "Time"?
@.@
Because it can be very easy to lose yourself in it.
yes
Cause if you think limbo is real
This is Time
Its awesome
yes Ignaesia
its almost impossible to get out
you think its real life
Because Limbo is lik eMinecraft on steroids
yeah
I wish I saw this at the movies :S
When watching Inception for the second time, it isn't half as elegant for some reason
therefore the kill yourself thing seems very real.
the only way to escape limbo is to die
This song just sounds so triumphant
12!Shipping
11http://pastebin.com/A1A58QpA
No, you can still kick
11There.
I lost the flow of the movie.Not a single sense was given that day.
elky, watch it a dozen times :P
I think it's twice as elegant
That's how Ariadne got out.
Limbo is like Minecraft, its so real that you think it is real life
it loses the mystery but gains a serious appreciation for the depth
I guess the score just lets you gloss over the plot holes and arbitrary restrictions
You understand how it all fits together the second time around.
Fastest customs evar
inb4 auuuuugh, come on!
Anyone know the name of this song?
dat DiCaprio frownline.
*glee*

OH HEY. I've been here since the second BMN! That's so awesome.
Matt, I've seen that
dsnesmith: it doesn't really seem like a deep movie to me
Spin spin spin.
Don't go to bed!
me too Razyn! :D
Weeping angels were ruined in their third episode.
we need Downfall in here sometime, its actually a pretty awesome movie
d'AAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
just remember that it's not about Fischer or Saito at all
Damn, I got kicked for no reason
11http://pastebin.com/A1A58QpA
4Now
11repost just in case.
Slenderman is like the Weeping angels
4Supposedly
What was the first BMN?
it's the story of Cobb getting over his guilt
WinstonChurchill: They had a second episode?
I thought that two-parter made them scarier
Don't f*cking cry...
Downfall parodys up in this BMN.
4The dredel topples
DON'T GO TO BED OR YOU'LL MISS THE FLOW OF THIS LOAD OF NON-SENSE!
/me brohoofs HeavyMetalPony
well yeah
4But they cut that
That which contains the image of an angel becomes an angel itself.
4So the ending is open to interpretation
I will just post it as is. XD
Can;t remember he first BMN actually...
faces
Is there an official way to request movies?
:D
Yeah, in second last series.
trollface
BEST ENDING EVER. :D
dum dum DUUUUUMMMMM!!!!!
That time freeze.
0Was the third episode the newest one? They are having another episode
http://1.media.dorkly.cvcdn.com/2/1/1d2c40c20a4bdf88633d87819ae9c89a.gif
Now...my interpretation...it didn't fall
WinstonChurchill: I'd say second episode actually, they worked better as a one shot villain than recurring enemies.
BWWWOOOOOOOOOONNGGG
He's still in limbo
Yes, dusk_fly
okay guys look
What does everyone else think?
HA HA TIME FOR PONIES xd
the top isn't his totem
and that sums it all up
LOTTERY
nope, if fell
Note this: Ever since he knocked it over on the sink HE NEVER SPUN IT UNTIL NOW

I think
it's time
I suggest a new format

11Now to put them into the randomizer.
It's RainBroDash's idea, but I thought it was a great plan
tell me tell me TELL ME!
11nope.avi
6REROLL
11redo
Instead of having people pick the same pony eps every two week, why not just do them in rotation
11FALL WEATHER FRIENDS
11THIS ISLAND EARTH
11SCOTT PILGRIM
11A DOG AND PONY SHOW
6Fall Weather Friends, This Island Earth, Scott Pilgrim, A Dog and Pony Show
11That's our lineup, folks. Tune in Next week!
Because, frankly, and I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm starting to get sick of the pony eps that keep getting chosen.
11And now we return you to the rest of this week's BMN.
aw the music cut out D:
yay
The randomizer always orders the BMN how I want it :D
WORST A MOVIE CHOICE POSSIBLE, HOW COULD YOUUUUUU????!!!?!?! >:(
Next time, this will be an epic BMN next time.

please use the MST3k Version of This island earth.
AH
As I was saying, weeping angels were ruined when they moved, and then utterly destroyed when Amy walked past them with her eyes closed. If they can sense you blink, they can sense you close your eyes.

Wait, so if we are in chat then were in the lottery.....cool :)
FUCK YES! Pony episode I would've picked got picked anyway.
My friend actually had some of Scott Pilgrim filmed a block away from her house in Toronto
i spy a luna
So, would Unico be an A or a B movie?
decent lineup is decent
FINALLY I CAN TALK!!!!!!!!
BEEP BEEP
K IM GONE BYEE
So to qualify as an A movie the movie must be: good, have a big budget, a serious movie (god knows we can't have an A movie comedy) and now it needs to be new too?...
printest woona
11We refuse to use the MST3K version.
HAHA TIME FOR PONIES
SCOTT PILGRIM FTW
/me also brohoofs DareDreamer
I can appreciate, I suppose

Ditzy Doo always goes to the gala.

Sometimes she even goes twice.

Fluttershy's sanity slippage begins
Stage 1 of rage.

Who the fuck is Ditzy Doo?
Oh Hipster...
Ditzy cooks the muffins
Fluttershy with curly hair = *melt*
0Lunas second behind Fluttershy.
4So, I'm reading up on the behind the scenes of Inception
Trappershy.
Farmer: U MAD?
Ditzy is Derpy's canon name
4Brad Pitt was offered the role of Cobb
Psychoshy!
*barf*
4BRAD PITT WAS OFFERED THE ROLE OF COBB
11As was Will Smith.
she hasn't been given a canon name yet
brb
Ditzy atm is just an offscreen pony.
inb4 humping pony
11AS WAS WILL SMITH!
But Brad Pitt was already in Cool World.
I JUST HAD SEEEEEEX
Lauren Faust gave her the name Ditzy Doo, so she's Ditzy Doo to me.
secret butt fun
4Holy shit, I fucking love Brad Pitt
>Flutetrshy putting Rarity's assertiveness training into practice
Will smith as cobb? ...
congratz
Okay, in this episode, Pinkie Pie is clearly best pony.
well, Faust did say if she WERE to make Ditzy appear, she'd assign it to Derpyu
Cool World joke FTW
...
lol
Derpy*
Brad Pitt couldn't have done it as well as DiCaprio
Faust called her Derpy
this episode has the biggest concentration of male ponies
the casting for Inception turned out perfectly
It's not even in his way
Brad Pitt would have been great too.
Fluttershy is scary in this episode.
4But seriously, I can only imagine how awesome Brad would have been as Cobb
pitt and smith can't strut well enough
She can call her more than one thing, y'know.
Hey, I would do the same thing as sir Jerk
4You're telling me Pitt couldn't have done drama?
I can't see pitt doing it well enough
It's not like there's a one name limit or anything.
11inb4 Pony Pokey
inb4 I just had sex
4You serious?
not the same way
Why do they even play it if they have no reason to?
4Go watch Se7en, tell me that wasn't awesome
amazing that they can't walk AROUND a puddle
Octavia is the best pony
I can't see anyone buy Leo as Cobb
Just walk around it?
induring awesome Pinkie
Strong arm
dat hump
I guess Will Smith is too busy being a father to be in too many movies. PSSH.
inb4 COME OUT
T_T
11I think all three of them would have been good.
I could see will smith doing it I guess
4Likewise
Douchebaggary #2

I'm surprised Rarity didn't already murder Prince Blueblood at that point
4I'm very, very happy Smith didn't take the role
nope, Brad Pitt wouldn't have done it well
Inb4 chatspam.

BISOOOOOOOOOON!
Apokalipse it's impossible to hear unless you take out the music

Man, what an *******!

Someone kill that colt....
I dunno, Pitt is great in comedies

11RANDOM TOMATO TRIVIA: Shot on Kodak 5247 negative stock - very unusual for a low budget film at the time. Most low budget films were shot on positive stock. The quality of the negative is one reason why many people thought the film cost more to make than it did.

11RANDOM TOMATO TRIVIA: The helicopter crash was unintentional. After being pulled from the wreck, Jack Riley and George Wilson ad-libbed the rest of the scene. The crash used up more of the budget than all other aspects of the film combined.

I mean tbh Derpy woudl aso fit..
4In that case, then it works that she's bi
yeahi'm fine with bi
4Hence, it would fit for Ramona
dat tumpit
Rainbow Dash is neither heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual. She is, in fact, omnisexual. Just look at the massive wingboner she gets from Mr. Turnip and his massive... party hat.
dusk_fly there is no canon evidence at all that she likes other females
/me continues to beat dusk_fly
tomatoes don't explod
Tomatos cannot explode? FALSE
Genius!
and they're BRAVEER
Also, Rainbow Dash is asexual, like all childrens' cartoon chartacters - at least in canon. In fanon she can be whatever you want.
RD is into inanimate objects. RD x Cloud, RD x Table.
Tomato vs a ......metal structure....there goes our tax money
/me sits next to dusk_fly and explodes.
Rainbow Dash = The Toddster?!?
Cloud?

Makes sense to me!
Yup, cloud.

/me feeds Drake with a nice juicy steak.
i thought i watched all the pony episode, but then i realized i forgot to watch the sleepover episode
No, Ignaesia. Sitting through 50 Apple Bloom spins means he's officially a brony
I'm gonna jet. Got a fanfic to write and I'm really getting behind on it. =/
GO TO 1 MILLION!!!!!1
/me noms it
But first, 200 spins!
I will stay until it hits 9000
And now I go.
I'd love to read that fic sometime DragonRage :D Good luck
Pony Spinathon.
GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO
I've only seen the sleepover episode once.
/me noms on his moniter
cutie mark niggers
04That was the idea :P
/me has seen lots of episodes only once
the sleepover ep is better than people give it credit for
Now that's where you're right, Ignaesia. :D
mmmm someone will ever do a "pony cover" of amazing horse?
OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOo
Hey Sprinkles,can you play my request?

Bye Darf :D
http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Look_Before_You_Sleep
adios

12nah, that would have been enjoyable
one spin a year!
adios interior_gummy
oh, i was saying bye to darf
i'm staying here
I love the sleepover episode. My fav.
/me knows that it's 50 cups of coffe and it's on
despite that, it gives some good character development and spins right round baby right round
/me wakes up
also, derpy>ditzy, faust be damned
So we do this for another ten minuets or so?
12:3
look at my pony, my pony is amazing

this is the metod for the creation of derp ponies
not a good sounding as nyan
:(
like a scientist boss
12lol
If the loop didn't suck I'd listen to this all day
i agree
4WE'RE ABOUT TO HIT THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST
if you look you can see Appleblooms plot for a few frames
You now realise that you've been staring at the ass of a pre-adolescent pony for 600 spins.
4BRACE YOURSELVES
how about we watch pony episodes for the post show!
I wish the loop was smoother sounding.
YAY!
see you all later time for me to go do something like......work, nah jk more laying aroung for me! c YA!

/me gives Pattyrick Arsenic hidden in cookies :3
Ok
7see you friday
you too
SO MANY SPINS
/me doesn't eat cookies that his mom didn't make
or Chips Ahoy
12D:
watching it to nyan cat loop
because of the hidden arsenic that I assumed is in there, based on the talk of arsenic
is so much better#
we survived to the 666 spins
how about we watch pony episodes for the post show!
ocjvndvbdlfjkvnei;jgbfg
I'm down with that
/me wouldn't mind some ASUS in his cookies, though :P
I call black dynomite again!
YAY interior_gummy i agree

if only the best of
Eeeeynope, Interior. It'll make the pony episodes we watched earlier, and the ones we will watch on Friday, less special.
Always up for a good pony episode.
YAY!
it will be different episodes
I prefer ytps for post-show
>implying pony episodes aren't already special by virtue of being pony episodes, anyway
/me gives Pattyrick a hamburger patty
Point, Rezo-chan.
/me runs
Well, I think I'm gonna cut out, too! This was a fun day! Thanks so much for picking me for the lotto, guys! Well, if it wasn't for that person who wasn't present, I wouldn't have won, so I should really thank him/her. Til next week. See ya, BronyState <3
bye dreamer

bye dare
YAY let's have a party!
Damn, by now she should have a spiral Cutie Mark
PONIES
WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
at this point I think Sprinkles just wants to get us out of the stream
NEVER
>implying every BMN isn't a party
It should say we're uber bronies or something
FUN FACT: The spins counter is slightly off.
i can tell
yeah it is :(
so for every 20, it's actually 21
The wifi I run on switched firewalls and for some reason youtube is blocked... >>;
It's raining! I'm gonna go get wet!
I muted this and am playing nyancat over this.
Fun Fact: the ever so slight delay of the audio feels horrible
/me watches in silence, knowing he went over 9K of those
at least it makes me cringe
>having your sound on for ponyspin
also, have some funky little tomatoes: http://pastebin.com/x9KqTre2
6I've hit over 100k.
I muted this and i'm listening to a parody of Grenade by Bruno Mars.
I put up next week's BMN and Encore BMN on Steam
sprinkles, can we watch ponies?
this is ponies
yes so i've seen
I'd drink lemonaaaaade for ya.
6I can't get youtube to work.
Didn't NewDCD say he'd come around and stream some Super Robot War Z 2 this night?
6Sorry guys.
listenting to avast fluttershy's ass
no, i mean watching them on the stream
like we did with today's episodes
in my town tonight we celebrate... something and we remain awake ALL the night, and i'm here watching this...
maybe sprinkles doesn't have them downloaded
play some G1
Gnorri you are the true winner
the counter variable is a var, this wil never stop
6I have all the pony eps downloaded.
>mutes sound and goes back to rewatching Gurren Lagann (ALREADY!!!!)
^^
typjk it will one day only so much memory in the world...
shit, accidentally closed the site
lol gummy
dd u have fun?
1500 spins
AWWWWWWWWWWWW YEEEEEEEAAAAAAH
when does it end?
never does
its goes on FOREVER
Until AppleBloom receives her cutie mark.
FOREVER
brb,gotta take a bath
awww shit, the mosquitoes want my blood
keep this going even when there isnt anypony around so we can get even higher
bye pegacorn
well lets discuss why Applebloom is the best pony
i predict an episode where one of the cmcs gets a cutie mark, and the other two learn a lesson about keeping her as a friend
see ya later pegacorn
/me looks for ValtheJean, Silvermane, Ziltoid and someone else.
<.< >.>
gummy: yup, seems likely
/me hides
because pinkie pie is the best pony
yeah, seems legit
I too have forseen such an episode, Interior.
YO SUP
DAWG
Naaah, they aaccept a pony as a cutie mark prusader which already has a cutie mark...
ValtheJean, get ready in case Silvermane comes. We gotta finish the example
okays
but the episode would have a twist
err...what was the chat name again for that? :P
oh yeah
you guys were talking forever
scootaloo would paint a fake cutie mark on her flank, causing the events on the episode
Nice pun, Elky.
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Hey, it's not my fault that my natural charisma leads to a silver tongue worth its weight in diamonds
heh, didn't even notice it
http://radionintendo.com/downloadcast.php?castid=151 Here's the Metroid special for those who missed it
if Trixie gets a return episode in season 2 I might just die of happiness
bleh
the return episode better be good
That WOULD be a good way to keep the status quo, although the very existnece of the CMCs proves FIM doesn't think the status quo is *god.*&
Just president.
because I'm sick of all these "Trixie is just misunderstood" threads
however i still think the old sci-fi movies are like the old my little pony...
trixie is the best pony!!!!!!!!!!!!!
twitht?
Mmmm, Metroid
inb3 trixie becomes one of the main cast
inb3
what
12oh ironic
12steak paradise~
I like the idea of her being outed and losing everything then the mane 6 help her back on her feet, so she learns the magic of friendship
>mfw I still think there needs to be an epic Gurren Lagann crossover fic one day.
give a look to equestria daily, "Snails Confirmed for Season Two"
12http://www.travelchannel.com/Places_Trips/Travel_Ideas/Food_And_Drink/Food/Steak_Paradise
so?
Yeah, it'd make a good aesop about how if someone makes one mistakes, it doesn't mean they're a bad person.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSS! YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!
YES
Havetubawilltravel exactly!
:)
lol, "one mistakes."
now if only Price Blueblood were to return...
my brain...is full of pony...and spinning
oh, and Braeburn ofc
they can scratch Luna though if they want
ee-...nah
...
I dont see Braeburn tbh as that story was resolved nicely, but you never know
mlp needs way more luna!
hm, maybe an Appleloosa spinoff show?
i'm a slowpoke
actually
like a western parody
s2 could be past since this would be epic :D
the only thing they would do further with braeburn is develop some sort of relationship with little strongheart...which would just be...ung...
another different Appleloosa ep would be cool though
ugh, that'd be terrible
one not involving the buson
bison
but Braeburn could visit Ponyville
HOLY CRAP SNAILS
...i don't care
trixie is better
>Mfw Fallout Equestria updated again.
I KNOW WHAT TO READ WHEN NOT WATCHING GURREN LAGANN NOW
wut?]
Trixie and Prince Blueblood would make great returning pseudo-villains.
i hope guerren what?
let's just watch downloaded pony episodes
*guerren what?
I just hope Trixie won't be like she's portrayed in the fandom
haha yeah
In Trixie's case less villain than 'Ridiculously overinflated ego of a wannabe-helpful that only makes everything worse. Hilarity ensues'
SO MANY SPINS
Too many spins?
as in twilight's fuck buddy?
yep
The only fandom character I was to see portrayed like in the fandom is Luna
we will get 10 spin in 10 second flat
as soon as any shipping becomes canon the show will have jumped 50 sharks with a jetpack
/me is hoping for a collective fangasm when the animators sneak a random abacus into the Luna episode's background.
what about the one-sided SpikeXRarity?
lol
she'd need a lot of episodes/character developement to shine, and I just don't see that happening
i'd prefer they introduced a completely new antagonist at the beginning of S2
yesterday, i dreamed luna talking whit twilight
Luna IS now co-princess. I don#t see why she wouldn't get snippets of more than one episode, kinda like celestia did (If less so)
well, if they're gonna have a Big Bad of sorts, a new one would be better
Ignaesia - pretty sure they're doing just that
So, is NewDCD gonna do stuff with the stream tonight?
I mean, returning NMM would be silly. Yet a big bad is confirmed. And AFAIK, it's even be stated it'll be a new one. So...
Rezo-chan makes sense tbh, gives them a new excuse for a toyline as well
well, the fandom has Luna as a stereotypical nerd/emo pony
i hope it's krastos
I'm back
in socks
hello pegacorn
No idea what a krastos is
Hey Peg
and a character like this can be easily made bland with not enough screentime
krastos the gluemaking bear
Krastos,the best badguy ever.
A Bear?I thought he was a demon-thing!
Celestia works perfectly with the amount of screentime she has, Luna... not so much
suddently, spins
I wish this chat was by the video window..
celestia should be the villain
well we know Luna is confirmed for at least 1 episode in season2, maybe she'll just get a one off appearence
7omg nearly 3000!
I wonder what the FiM crew would do with Catrina
or other G1 villains, for that matter
Krastos should be a good guy.
As amusing as trollestia/ evil empres celestia are in the fandom, I think I only want to see the canon celestia in the series
^
No.Trollestia IS canon.
maybe an alternate universe, where the six friends are the elements of despair and are led by an evil empress
more like lightJokelestia
it was semi-canon in a bird in the hoof
There's a bit of a difference between 'I'll trick Mr. Cake' trollestia and 'I'll fuck with my sister until she thinks of suicide' trollestia, Pegacorn
gummy: and they all have goatees
not more princess celestia, but furher celestia
@interior_gummy:Would Krastos be a good guy in that universe?
maybe
I also hope Spitfire/The Wonderbolts make more appearences
and trixie is a humble, secluded magician
anyway, I'm off to bed now
Wonderbolts are problematic
bye
Krastos and the Shadowbolts saving that alternate universe would be awesome.
bye elky
cya Elky
You can't show them too often, otherwise you start wondering just how long it takes rainbow dash to get in

12cheese steak sandwich
Still watching Apple Bloom chase her tail.
She has an excellent sense of balance.
/me noms the little edge off of it
Since she hasn't collapsed from the spinning yet.
cheese steak....that sounds good atm
I haven't had a cheese steak sandwich in like forever
those are good
she will vomit her soul
<3
lol timing
12lol
I know. She should be a gymnast and get a spiral Cutie Mark.
I dunno Havetubawilltravel I can usually turn off my tropersense pretty easily
12i made the mistake of putting jalapenos on it
Mmmm.... Big Philly Cheesesteak I liek
12it killed the flavor of the steak
I like jalopenos with cheese steak sandwiches D:
we going for 9001 spins?
and/or banana peppers
I love jalapenos, but the last time I had them put on, they put too many and ^^&
can someone tell us some joke? i'm bored
but I'm just weird like that :P
12i love jalapenos on anything
We all died.
12but jalapeno is a demanding flavor
/me laughs
SCOOTALOO IS SPY!
That's a fun one.
I'm just a naturally cynical person, especially when it comes to movies and TV. That's why I value FIM; it gives me a break from this cynical world.

4See ya Sathi
Here is a joke: So there was this english nobleman who was getting annoyed at a mole digging holes in his garden, he told his staff to remove it while he was away at the weekend. When he returned he asked what happened to the mole, they said: "We caught him sire, and due to the distress he has caused you we decided to give him the most horrific death we could
4Have a good one

Or are you talking about UFC?
6This to me is NOTHING.

Probably UFC

I loved it when Brock Lesnar turned up in the UFC and trolled the fanboys something hard
boo
Jess!
AH
/me hugs

I loved it when Kurt Angle bitched about other wrestlers using "his" finisher (the ankle lock) when he wasn't even the first one to use it. *waves at Ken Shamrock*
THIS+DUBSTEP=SEX IN MY EARS
All right for a cold walrus. xD
How are you?
Super stiff, but good
12Who's Jess?
wb aero (late)
4FreezeFrame is a wrestling fan, eh?
thanks Kos
Brock Lesnar is a pro wrestler! he doesnt know BJJ! Hes gonna be a joke!.... Lesnar wins the heavyweight title in a week and keeps it for years, never trains in BJJ, only wrestles. BJJ nutriders cry. All is right with the world

I would watch TNA if they could get their act together.
FreezeFrame MOAR LEIK TNGAY AMIRITE
12If that's the case, then where's James?
4*nods*
And ROH is coming to a network channel I allegedly have, but that seems to have stopped working right for a couple weeks now.

Have you seen "Joker" Sting?
4Are you keeping up with the recent CM Punk angle?
only 1001 more spins to go
Wow. It's still going.
What the hell happened to TNA, I remember it being so baddass a few years ago
lol!
4@Ignaesia: Russo, Bischoff, Hogan
Vince Russo
Godammit...
dusk: I think everyone is.
8000
Which moron hired those
Dixie Carter signed off on them.
4They also changed the hexagonal ring to a typical four post ring, and that was one of the things they had going for them
It would have been fine with just Bischoff and Hogan
dusk_fly Yeah I noticed, thats when I started raisng eyebrows
Hey What we talking about?
Jon rasslin'!
4Wrasslin
Oh.
4It appears there's a few fans in the fim fandom
4DAT ALLITERATION
Sooo... was Punks contract really terminated or was that another swerve within a swerve?
Be right back.
hahaha
With Vince rehired, it was just derp I'ma recreate nWo
4Punk claims that he didn't re-sign until the night of MITB
4But even that's kinda iffy
He didn't, but he was going to for sure.
Wrestling is rediculious the end
This only worked because CM Punk knows how to keep stuff quiet and work something like this.
4If Punk really was leaving, there's no way Vince was gonna let Punk win AND leave with the belt
Remember his leaving RoH?
Goddamn Vince Russo, didn't they learn their lesson from WCW
/me yawns
4I can't believe Carter and Jarrett brought Russo on to TNA. Even worse, he's their head booker *shaking my head*
My only qualm is that apparently, throwing tantrums and flipping out makes you a face (Randy Orton)
laggy as all hell
Heya~
4He got over some how
Randy does not make a good face
4IMO, they killed what little character he had left when he was drafted to Smackdown
now ive got nothing against Randy Orton as a performer... but holy crap is he boring to listen to
4That's when he started slapping hands and acting like a face
It's over 8000!
Orton should be tweener, at best.
How dare...you...mock...his promo...skills...
4Even as a heel
It's because the turn wasn't done wel.
my sync says it's 8600
4Haha, Si
well*
D=
4I believe Orton had something going when he was a face/tweener
4But Smackdown...
4Completely obliterated his character
4Now he sticks his tongue out and RKO's people on the spanish announce table
The_Si: If you mock his promo skills, he'll kick you where your appendix used to be.
!
4No, no, he only punts when the other guy needs to be taken off air for some time
That was unintentional comedy gold
dusk: Jeff Hardy/Randy Orton feud
did we get to 9000?
4Y2Serious is a fucking awesome gimmick
He's one of the few who can pull off both alignments well.
Y2J does as well.
4Cena...Cena needs to turn
4Now
I foresee a Cena turn soon.
4He's trying everything possible to stay face, and he just comes off desperate
so how many spins did we stop apple bloom at?
Y2J is a genius on the mike as a heel tbh, always makes me laugh
ARM BAR
4"Ooh, Punk's rebellion is going over. I should say the same things! Do you guys like me now?"
nvm

4Nah
Through the commercial break.

almost 9001!
IT'S OVER 9000!!!1
6TROLOLOLOLOLOL
4They went to commercial and started mocking the fans teams and when they returned to the show, he skipped to 600 or something
;-;

Then he later reprised it with the 1001 opponents.
4Yes

Brokeback Jerishow was hilarious.

Show Miz worked well, too.
WTF IT WAS AT 8999 ON MY STREAM AND YOU PULLED IT
and now?
XD
dat luna
Show/Kane is also always a good team
we are dommed
emphasis on 'sometimes' I take it :P
4Except Show is out for a while and Kane too, I believe
4IT'S ALL MARK HENRY'S FAULT
Show/Kane as face is hilarious

IT'S DEAD!
Henry/Sheamus is a good feud.

Beth Phoenix and Nattie Neidhart heel turn has made me interested in the Diva storyline for the first time in a long time.
Granted, they're basically just taking what would have been Kharma's, but still.
4They should be called the Sisters of Destruction
Nattie had that in her Twitter, actually.
4Hah, really?
Yup
4Nice
/me has a whole bunch of wrasslers followed
4In any case, I really cannot wait till Kharma comes back
4It just sucks so much that she got pregnant right when she debuted
Agreed.
4Hold on
4Don't tell me
4Justin Gabriel
4...I don't know the other
Ezekiel Jackson
4wut
Yup.
4O_______________O
4Wow
Wait, no, I misread his tweet
4Ohhhh
4Guyana sounds like it's in South Africa
He's definitely one of the better big guys they have
4But, his mic skills
4And he turns frequently
4Only Kane can do that shit
4In fact
4I consider Kane to be the one true Tweener on the roster
4the guy's on nobody's side
Angle can do the heel-face revolving door
I hope Kane and Show come back from their time off with their fun face characters intact
4I haven't watched Angle since his departure from WWE
4Well, it depends. I wouldn't mind it, but Kane going "SHOW, SHOW :O" is so awkward >_>
Kane and Show are comedy gold as faces.
4I say the same about BookerDust
Like actually pulling out the kitchen sink in a street fight
GoldT was hilarity
4Man, Goldust's stuttering was awesome. And Booker was the perfect foil
very much so, Kos
very much so...
/me shot
4It's a shame that they were pretty much shrouded by Evolution though : /
So how about that randysavage huh?
He's elbow dropping angels now.
4I cried when I opened my browser and my homepage read "Randy Savage dies in car wreck." I had really just looked into Savage's past stuff and I fell in love with his promos.
sweet

Something popped into my mind...When is this site moving and what was the adress again?
I am only here now because I have stopped at a hotel for the night
alright lets see how bad my splatter is up and down the AM band
with the audio passband filter I am using disabled
03I saw a guy earlier in a Ford F-150 pickup truck modded with two gian5t antennas
03XD
its about 50 KHz all the way up and down the dial
4Storm is upset over that?
4Why?
might be CB or something else
4I mean, it's not like he trademarked those maneuvers
Because "no real wrestler would keep their shoulders that close to the mat"
03I'll upload the pic
4@Jon: We'll be moving within two weeks
and I think I did it
As though screwjobs are as prevalent in 2011 as they were in the 90s
4Oh, come on Storm
I tweaked the equalizer and got AM to sound like FM!
WHO NEEDS HD RADIO!?
4You're just grasping at straws
Okay.
03me
Or as though they aren't actual control maneuvers
Not us
03for MF
03*FM
03MF'ing FM
/me runs
FM SUCKS
/me runs
no seriously though, its problematic as heck
4Still, I like Lance. He's a great technical wrestler and I can't help but respect guys like that
weak stereo signal?

those are the so called "twin trucker" antennas
4...I need to go to a CHIKARA event some time
@Ghosties What's Chikara?
4Chuck Taylor...man, I love that guy
Ezekiel just retweeted a fan's picture of his nieces meeting Zeke: http://twitpic.com/624odl
03heh
VioletVanilla: Pro Wrestling taken to 11
4CHIKARA is a small wrestling indie fed
o:
>mfw I don't think NewDCD will stream SRW Z2 tonite.
Ooh, free plate IDs
plus did you know FM stereo is sent out using a form of A<?
They've got an overarching, fed-wide story, and over-the-top hilarity.
*AM?
4XD at Zeke's face, look's just like Mr. T
03technically they're all just electromagnetic waves :P
double sideband surpressed carrier is used for the difference (L-R) information
4I gotta agree with FreezeFrame, it's PG wrestling done right
although for AM stereo the difference information is sent using a form of FM
4Because invisible hand grenades are fucking AWESOME
03LOL what
yep
its true
It sounds like a blast. . . Where is it done? The US?
Northeast
grenades?
4Yeah
PM or phase modulation is used for the AM stereo difference information
4Chuck Taylor throws invisible hand grenades at his opponents
4And his opponents sell it
4It's great
What.
And there's the Osirian Connection, who hypnotise opponents.
PM at high levels looks just like FM on an oscilloscope
Into breakdancing.
4And Player Uno
oh
03well
but in AM stereo the modulation levels are low
that thing
03say you have 95.5 FVM
03*FM
jesus
03what AM channel would have the stereo info o.o
Interesting. . .
sent on the normal FM carrier
lemme see if I can the video
Maybe next time I visit I'll see one of these Chikaras. . .
4I love how the smarks are the good guys at Chikara and the really clean cut, clean shaven babyfaces are the heels
It also had the famous Kenny Omega/DBD match during the latter's WWE "firing" (basically Vince telling DBD to do some indy shows to get Mattel off their backs about the tie thing)

40 to 15,000 Hz contains the regular program audio, 19,000 Hz is the FM stereo pilot, 38,000 Hz is the FM stereo difference information, and 57,000 Hz (if used) is RDS
That was Chikara/CZW co-show?
4HOLY FUCK
4SUGARHILL GANG
4THIS
4THIS SIR
4IT'S AMAZING
02*WB03(Aurora03)02WB* - <Aurora> 06I acknowledge I have issues, I am ok with it
/me sighs.
4I can't stop laughing
<mfw announcers say illegal hypnosis
<mfw i hear the word hypnosis in wrestling
4I'll really have to rethink my opinion of CZW if that was all CZW's idea
lol
there faking it
4Well, yeah
4Doesn't mean it's not highly entertaining
Since someone mentioned Lesnar earlier: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxlX2l25Utw
this goes perfectly with the epic sax guy
It's not the nasty botch SSP
4Oh man, Lesnar's Shooting Star Press
lol fat guy
4Too bad he didn't land it right
He had the guy too far.
4Yep
god that faceslide
4Man, I didn't know Lesnar was in the WWE that far back
4But speaking of Kenny Omega, I watched a video of him wrestling a 9 year old Asian girl yesterday
Yeah, headslide was epic
4http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9obAE2w26Y
Can't remember her name, but she's really good
4Haruka
Last time I watched professional wrestling, the WWE was still called the WWF.
And hadn't bought out WCW yet.

I stopped watching professional wrestling because it became predictable.
And less entertaining.
4Well then
4I'd say watch WWE for CM Punk right now...but knowing WWE, it'll just go back to Cena dominating everything again
4I can't help but feel they're gonna screw it up
I love Kenny Omega's mannerisms
4True
4He did a really great job at keeping her safe
They wouldn't have had that with anyone who couldn't.
Ooh! Pony Psychology update!
4Right
Ditzy Doo: Muffins is 3 chapters
were off to......the LIBRARRY!!!!!!!!!
4Aww, I was gonna thank Ziltoid for showing me that awesome videeo
4*video
4Oh well
uh what
4Thank you for showing me that video
no problem
4Fucking love it
I just sent my modapp

/me would apply, but doesn't have the time to mod
/me is litsening to too shy by Kajagoogoo
4I definitely hope you come back to more streams, FreezeFrame. Was this your first stream?
The amount of spoilers during inception really sucked
lol
which one?
fridays or todays?
fridays
lol
today wasnt too bad from what I saw
Second
4I see
Well, I caught part of last week's
i belong to the blank generation
I was, unfortunately, working for both.
4Yeah, Friday's stream was pretty bad
4We had to ban one guy for spoiling when we asked the room to stop
I tought you banned atleast 2?
4The Blank Generation, eh? Isn't that the era of the beatniks and what have you?
4Just one
yea
4Didn't The Who write a song called "Blank Generation?"
/me (wispers*"Blank Generation" is a song)p.s. you guys rock
4Oh fuck no, I'm way off
lol
4Blank Generation was kind of a name given to the Punk era in the 70's I guess, though it belonged to the beatniks in the 50's as well
drf, has universehosting stopped bleeping yet?
lol why is no one on?

I suck at actingn
12okay

>mfw so fking looking forward to moar Gurren Lagann combat
:3
I'm going to shat brix
Dem making a love letter to all the Mecha genres of the 70s, 80s and 90s and trying to start a new mecha era...
still gotta find the movies though
(and no problem NewDCD)
also DCD, pm.
ohaidere

/me is playing some PnP RPG right now
o-o

heya drf
03hi /
03*:/
has universehosting stopped being retarded?
and may the dicerolls be with you!
and is anything wrong? >:
03something is wrong yes
03and nope
03island is still down
03and they haven't replied to my ticket
03even though I said it was high priority
03>_>
04o-o
their viper server was good
blackstar sucks
and what's wrong?
Remember, if your dice fail you, a quick trip into the microwave will teach them to behave themselves.
03Eh
03I had this Xbox Live match with LL and her sister, and BL and BL's boyfriend
03that ended up turning into a giant screaming match
I'm playing a paladin
03due to BL's parents etc
03and i6t just kinda annoyed me
03-6
(and there are a few)
I love playing non-douchebag pallies
04NS what have you done to me.
Wait, you can do that?!
lol
Yes, it's perfectly legal
04Everytime someone says something about their lives these days I automatically think up a sarcastic remark about it.
They are called blackguards, Dashite.
:3
Oh! I got it.
There's a difference between being a beacon of good and having a +3/+3 quarterstaff up your arse
o-o
Well that was a failure. I was given "airport" on draw my thing. Started by drawing the terminal, and a road
+5 quarterstaff of straightness.
>:
/me hugs drf
Then I drew an airplane and made an arrow towards the building
Only realized what it looked like AFTER someone guessed "9/11"
100% chance im as stright as a circle
(Though I don't think my old DM would really like non-DB pallies. He made the players RP the code of conduct since of the various powers they got.)
Also, he banned Monks. Forever.
03LOL
12XD
The code of conduct doesn't require douchebaggery
He found them nonfitting in the settings
nope, Dashite.
just the monks of the shaolin' type.
Definitely!
Wanna say that again to luna? I got a ticket for a trip on my lawnchair with your name on it.
(well, battlepriest)
03hm
03I think I have like 0.1 bitcoins now
03which is like $1-2
12i don't know how to prep everything for college D:
03after one day
03XD
12How many blocks is that?
03blocks?
why? heavy armor and can self-heal?
And ridiculous buff spells
12Yeah, aren’t bit coins divided up into blocks?
03no
who else is the buff-debuffer?
Oh right. Druid.
12Oh lol
And even then.

asdfgh
ok
so
blargh
/me watches Die Hard on TV
03and ?
6I got sent to the hospital in an ambulance
6:|
03What
03what happened
>mfw happy to see Gurren Lagann in the fight
6I had a cyst, didn't know i had one
6and it ruptured
FIGHT!
6during a huge relay walk
6I did one lap, and basically passed out
DRILL-FIGHTER
03wow
Oh dear. ._.
/me hugs
6got sent to the hospital and was there for 4 hours, going through IV, ultrasound, and dangerously low blood pressure
9actually the first mech to use a Drill
9Getter Robo
Ah
what kind of cyst?
NewDCD, why no mic?
Dubtrot: Game was never released in US
12oww Aurora D:
Copyright hell
6ovarian
DubtrotMaster, no dubbing, even fandub out yet.
cyst?
6which sucks, cuz those apparently are the extremely painful kind
12well
DAI-GUARD F YEAH
12your filling refilled
6cyst, it's kind of like a blister on the inside of your body
6and when they burst, it's somewhat of a problem
Ouch... It must've been large, they usually pass easily
6cuz it hurts
9>recognizing Dai-Guard
12drf
9SON
9I AM PROUD
03what
12now you can tell people you got two fillings in one tooth
Dat arm
12way to sound gangster
Made me do more research
Because Dat fking arm.
I love how Gurren Lagen critted for more damage than its total health bar
It is so fking awesome.
6not large enough to be removed though
at least you're alright now
03LOL
._.
dmn
That ain't GUrren Lagann
/me hugs Aurora
03nah, the filling fell out
That was Dai-Guard
03wait, the ydidn't remove it?
6no
12people don't need to know that
lag stream
6it's benign
ain't got no lag.
AT ALL.
6meaning the blood tests showed it wasn't canerous
And I be in canada and he be in Panama
aurora...I'm sorry to hear that happened. :/
hugeass distances no affect me
well me too
6which...would have been ironic, since the relay I was walking in was a walk for cancer cure
03LOL
6it's fine
03well
6I actually took the whole thing well mentally
03I thought generally they need to remove cysts whether they're cancerous or not?
My internet has been sucking alot recently
6I basically was mortified that EVERYONE in the relay saw me get removed in an ambulance
only when they're large enough
6that my friends were standing right next to me while we waited for help
6basically
6i laughed through most of this
9rule of thumb in this stream
12you know they were thinking "i knew we should have let her win"
6and overall hated the fact I was in a hospital, bored out of my mind
9make sure your download rate is above the 0.564 Mbps rate
6until the doctor gave me a clipboard and a pen so I could draw
6but aside form that
Aha
12Aurora i know the feeling
9use speedtest.net
03wait but
it's not
12i've been in a hospital bed before
12with IVs
03if they don't remove them
>yfw the mech I use in SRW-J already has 8K hp in scenario 10 and hits for 5K damage in average. He oneshots EVERYTHING.
03isn't there some object inside your body blocking what should be there?
12my problem is i hate to lay on my back and the IV tubes kind of restrict your movement
alright
9distance has no importance when streaming via a service like Veemi
9so yeah
alright
9all that matters is your dl speed
9also makign sure you don't dl anything in the meantime
9Derma
9what did you choose?
yes?
Granteed
9Bellzelute, Granteed or Coustwell?
9oh I see
9I'm running through the game with Bellzelute
Had tried Bellzelute first time, got curbstomped in FIRST level.
Changed for the more heavier armored one.
IVs x.x
Curbstomping EVERYTHING.
12IVs aren't bad
9understandable. You probably didn't understand how to play Real Robots just yet
What was the point of them again? :P
IVs are horrible
They are
9remember
9Real Robots are all about evasion
Because they make you pee every half hour
9and Supers are all about defense
LOL
.94Mbps
Alright
12.-.
It's true!
that didn't happen to me
Though I prolly still don't know how to play well enough.
03HML
03the point of them is to hav ea constant supply of drugs into your system
Very frustrating when your head's swelled up so much that you can't walk
03opposed to just a shot or pills which doesn't last as long
I mostly send Granteed in the MIDDLE of the biggest bunch of enemies so he tanks the most attacks.
Clears map fastest
Can take 5 enemies in their round with him alone
9man I'm hating how the stream is looking at the moment
I'd rather take pills every minute than deal with that
9give me a sec to fix quality
no problem
03LOL
Seriously, having stuff in me is a no
03that's what sh esaid
Hahah
6late but
6if it was a problem, they would have removed the cyst then and there
6but the ultrasound showed it wasn't blocking anything and it was too small to be a problem
03but I mean
BTW. I did all-attack researches on youtube for a few robots. That was how I recognized Dai-Guard. Without ever seeing any other mech anime than Gurren Lagann
6but I'm going to be monitored
03how is it not ba dto have that inside you
12say that when it's 5AM and you keep getting waken up every minute to take a pill
6cysts are extremely common actually
9live again
What's the name of the black guy anyhow that you were all happy to get before?
03odd
6it's more costly and almost pointless to remove it right now
03I've only heard of them being BAD
I never sleep in hospitals anyway :|
6because it may never grow larger, it might even go away
oh snap
mind checking if quality isn't worse now?
9quality is even worse
9btw
6benign means it's not harmful...aside from this, but otherwise not threatening
I went three days without proper rest last time xD
12everyone does
03LOL, reminds me of a line from Scrubs
Eventually you'll sleep
03"It looks benign" "Benign, nine and a half, something like that"
LOLwhat
(what's the name of the robot that was all mysterious with only mouth visible for the robot last stream?
9I forget
9Pilot is Asakim though
the one who pushed the top off the mech with his hand?
well, I'd sleep if I didn't have something stuck in my arm .v.
/me squicks
Interesting new Origin of Equestria story up on EqD
Just called "Stories"
It's not that bad
PHOTON BEAM?
oh wait.
that's photon beam up to 11.
Well it seemed terrible last time that happened XD
9gotta love Photon Beam's dynamic kill in this game
eeyup
6but ugh that IV
(no microphone tonight, NewDCD?)
6my parents always joked about my fear of needles
I think I'm now happy to avoid the shoutbox
9nope
alright
9my throat feels sore
no problem.
Let it rest
12what if that something stuck in your arm was a sedative?
12would you fall asleep then?
6but
6I got vicadin
Who...?
6as my perscription
well if I noticed :P
6I WILL SLEEP WELL
lol wut?.....??????????????/????????????
LOL
6plus
HML, the amount of MLP in there makes me want to burn it down
6my stepmom spoiled me shopping today
What does Vicadin do again
speedtest doesnt work for me
Z?
6it's an intense pain killer
9Dubrot, that's what REALLY HIGH HP bosses have as their counters
6but also knocks you out
6I took it when I had my wisdoms taken out
Well, that's fun
oh
6I slept for 18 hours of the day
ALRIGHT
6only waking up to eat and take my antibiotics
03LOL @ shoutbox
03it's called a spambox
03get it right
Pill right?
6some people are immune
6but it knocks me out entirely
6yeah
SEND KING KETTAN IN
12i'm surprised drf doesn't call it applebox
I need a double dosage next time I see a doctor 8D
COMBINING SHIELD N SPEAR
6but yeah, when I finally could walk again without my blood pressure dropping to threatening levels
6we went shopping
Nice way to end the day :P
6she got me cookies, pocky, let me choose breakfast for tomorrow
Pocky xD
6bought me pretty much whatever I wanted to eat lol
12you nevered finished your lap?
12pfft
Not particularly
6bree
HECK YEAH
/me hides
6i did actually
it's just the MLP crap that's annoying me
6I got one lap in
KILL EM
all there ever is in there is MLP, MLP, and more MLP
12finish the other 500 laps
6and then we sat down in the bleachers for opening ceremonies
6right when we were about to go for the second, I felt the pain coming on
6and within 10 seconds I was out
GURREN LAGANN GO
6also I'd like it to be known
SHOW EM WHO'S BOSS
6I like MLP
YAAAA
6I hate how popular it is
6x.x
We all don't xD
.v.
9also used "Hot Blood" command. It doubles damage from a single attack
how many enemies u have left?
6like, I seriously HATE how people bring it up like this
GIGA DRIIIIIILL BREAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK!!!!!!
9just this boss
6I just sit here and say "yeah I like it", but holy crap people just
6wow
nice
03how does one use a shoutbox without spamming?
03I've never seen it done yet
They don't spam it :p
Dat dodge
03>MLP links everywhere
03>Not spam
03what is this i dont egven
03-g
That's not exactly spamlol

9GET
6 4 years ago
6but now
6nope

04hey Roara
there is too much lag
dat combo
6hi
<mfw my download speed is 0.4mbps
that attack feels half-assed
6I should scan the pictures I drew in the hospital, wasn't so bad lol
(the boss's)\
Hah
03LOL, even in the hospital you draw stuff?
9dat GODMARS
POWER OF THE EIGHTIES
GO
Could you even draw in that condition O.o
6HML....it was interesting
6i had an IV in my right arm
6which is my drawing arm
oooohhhh sheeett
:|
6I also had one of those finger pulse monitors
Fun
mabye i might stay
6but I managed to draw without bending my elbow
6so it didn't disturb the iV
6I also couldn't use my index finger, so yep
9GO, MELON HEAD!
Godly drawing xD
6but yeah, they were like "sure she can draw, just don't mess with the iv"
6and they kept walking in like "wow you're really good lol"
I wonder what would of happened if you did mess with the IV
We need to see Yoko actually using her gun in a SRW fight.
6problems
it hurts?
her as a fighting unit would be beyond epic.
6considering the thought of a piece of plastic tubing being in my vein made my blood pressure spike
6I HATE needles
9Dermathil
Same here >.<

Holy shit Kingra I hate you.
6as I've had to tell approximately 60 people today (my stepmom posted a picture of me on facebook of me drawing in the bed)
Your text is complete rape in the face.
9Random DCD Trivia: Gundam X is his favorite Gundam series. And this Gundam Double X, or DX
6everyone in town knows me as it is lol
6and we stopped at target and safeway before I went home
6anyways, I'm absolutely fine, everyone's just like "OH MY GOD ARE YOU OK? @#$%^&#Q?"

9Supers: Unique, heroic, have a superhero quality to them, often empathic
I read about the difference between real and Supers
One is a Tool and the other is a vehicle
The tool is the Super
The vehicle is the Real

9that description is pretty accurate
9not perfect, but it will do
well aerial gunman
7Thank you.
9Airmaster Burst

aurora
I <3 you
so much
I WILL!
9I hope we get Jamil and GX-Divider
thanks to that pic everyone is getting my details right
9or hell, regular GX would be awesome
(the tool is an instrument that focuses the strength and the emotions of the user, while the vehicle just is stronger while the pilot is the brains)
9Satellite Cannon spam all day erry day
12hi both
o-o
btw, I always make Granteed counter in enemy phase.
evening
:p
He basically eats the attacks in that mode and gets 300hp dmgs
9Dermathil; that's not always a great idea. Remember to be situational
I know.
9I think J was said to be pretty easy though
Mostly to clear the mooks though
6lol yay :D
6that was my goal
6nothing's better than an accurate rf
6ref
but he's got 8K hp at that point and has parts that basically negate most of the damage he gets
6and thats why I bugged so much lol
so I counter and clear
also keeps the other robots from too much damage
9Garrod is also my favorite Gendum pilot

exact same game

I SAID NEEDS MORE BALLOON PORN
IMO FB > G+
Animations looked a bit older FSR
Which game this this?
04I REALISED
OKAY THEN
9Dermathil: Melee version is just better, what with Attack-after-Move and a cooler finisher for Assault Combat Pattern - Faiz
121. More than ten people a year are killed by vending machines.
04STOP USING YOUR STUPID SCRIPT SO I CAN READ IT
eeyup, DCD
9some of these units have recycled animations from SRW Z for PS2
crono_flash, that would be Super Robot Wars Z2 Hakai-hen
9albeit I wouldn't say they look "Older"
9more probably due to the drawing styles of some of the characters
anyone know if Agarest is any good?
122. President George W. Bush was once a cheerleader!
I'm in desperate need of some SRPG goodness after this...
04That explains a lot.
12lol
lawl.
9Agarest is by Idea Fuck
NewDCD, send Dai-Guard in.
9it's very convulted, as such
04Remember when people loved Myspace?
125. More Monopoly money is printed in a year, than real money printed throughout the world!
9it's not BAD, it just has shit that will leave you like WHAT THE HELL
04Now barely people remember it existed.
04...In 4 years.
(very different from Gurren Lagann)
04Maybe even 2
GO DAI-GUARD!
ARM-THROW GO
/me humps Umbreon?
12eep
125. Over 1,000 birds a year die from smashing into windows.
04SHOCK AND DISMAY
yea
eh, convoluted is fine, as long as it's decently balanced and not too easy
04Hey now
people are fleeting these days
12lol Myspace
04If we're doing that take it to #4chan. That place needs moar activity
12i'll take my knowledge elsewhere then D:
9I think Hardcore Gaming 101 has an article on it
12My CPU hates that site :|
126. According to statistics, Australian women are most likely to have sex on the first date.

04Actually
04That's probably true
LOL
lolque
12well now i know what Dragoran is doing on her first date
/me hides
out of Agarest and Disgaea 3, what would you pick?
KING KITTAN GO
and screw #4chan :|
/me laughs nervously
9Disgaea would be a more popular pick
9never managed to get more into Disgaea though
OH god
9and never played Agarest
Drake is gonna sex up NS

Technically, IRC channel
there's no such thing as an "irc site", though I suppose some abuse of terminology might let you call an IRC server that.

12Yep :3
12And I have one brother xD
12^^
12No other siblings lol (somewhat glad XDD)
12Lol
12Do you have a photo or are you not one to share those?
04I have an elder sister. We get on each other's nerves alot.
12Well, thing is with that, I’m just so picky that I never think any of them are good enough
12XD
12Speaking of that, I also study photography on the side at home
04Do you have a camera of your own?
12Yep, a canon eos SLR
12It's pretty awesome, took me half a year to save up for it LOL
I have a half-broken Canon PAS
12Ah
Powershot IS720 or something
720IS
?
04I can now officially say I have a dragin plushie
04dragon*
12IS is awesome. However, if you use a tripod, you want to make sure it's off
12I love how I can upload 22MB in two minutes :D
12The fact that there’s no shaking causes the IS in the lens to vibrate causing blur
12What is IS?
12I am into photography (getting into it should i say)
12Image Stabilizer
12Is it like ISO?
12Ah
12Frikkin Windows movie maker D:<
12Basically it stabilizes shacking therefore preventing blur
do you mean, Windows Movie Mangler?
12It stabalises by shaking back?
12lol..
12Indeed XD
12I have premiere but I am only cutting home videos, can't be bothered with all that
12that's useful to know
12I am looking to get a good camera with a lens at some point
drf prefers Corel Video Studio, but I prefer Premiere because it's sensible & logical, and none of the noobish stuff in it.
12Your welcome :3
12IS is a very useful tool
12DRF complains that it's bloated and it is infact.. but I prefer it too, for the reasons you mentioned
12It's something I've always used, I'm used to it
I actually use some of the bloat
inb4: it's not bloat if you use it
12But yeah, feel free to ask me anything about that stuff XD

CVS sucks tbh
DRAKE

12Hey ^^

How's it going?
12Alright ^^ XD just trying to get Lugia to work with me LOL

07fwee!
07Hi
12Don't often see you here
07Hi Arti!
07Nope XD
07I'm not often here
12Back
12Articuno
12We need to battle in PO some time :)

12Just noticed your CSS stuff removes the shoutbox XD
/me deletes that bit XD
12XD
nooooooooo
):
12I deleted that as well XD
I put comments in there that said to remove it
I was too lazy to remove it since I use that on my profile
Oh right

I sent a request to get one, and Google said they'd e-mail me when they can let more people in
can you join immediately if Arti invites me?
07pretty much yeh
blah
I searched up Google+ on Google, asked to join, signed in with my Google account, and they said they'd e-mail me when it's open for more people to use
07ah
12Pattyrick if you promise to use Google + i will invite you ;>
12and same for anyone here!

I'm going to try to hook up my new PC now, so I won't be on too much

06arti
06i would like one
12:3
12Send me your email!
06oh, ok :3
/me poofs up
07Arti is floofy!
I got your e-mail, Arti, I just need to make sure I have a reliable IC
/me floofs!
04o-o
/me rubs his face in Arti's floofy
04http://i56.tinypic.com/ddgle8.jpg
04I feel like showing it off so I will.
inb4 rawr
Keeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen
04Looks like you're saying 'keen'
Ken :p
12I re-enabled the popup notifications on the forums
12But, there's still no option to make it optional ovO LOL
Is it a mod, Arti?
12Yep
Hm
How does it work? You could do an if so it only runs if there's a certain cookie
Which is added by an option in the profile
$_COOKIE or something
12I'd not be able to code it and I dunno how it works
12Also I know Lugia wouldn't want to code it, he has more important things XD
Link to the mod then? :p
It kinda looks like jvascript to me though
javascript
and I'm still learning javascript
04I am lagging
04so friggin' much
Because you suck, Drake
04No, seriously
04TST is not loading at all.
04Or when it does, the interface is screwed over
!check lugia.us
It's just you. http://lugia.us is up.
it's just you Drake
04:/
oh yeah, btw, Drake and Articuno, is it okay with you if I move the date of meeting back by half an hour?
04yes
12Better for me ^v^
12So 10pm?
and I have to try and accomodate everyone
...can't spell
yep
12Also, I have centered the last post thing on the forums
12Like you wanted
04argh
Oh
04Dad's gonna blame me for this
12Just applying it to the other themes
Yep, looks much better, Articuno
thanks
And yeah, Articuno, is the mod in javascript or PHP?
12It's ajax I think
because it looks to be in javascrip-
12and must be some php too
oh right, I forgot about ajax
yeah it's probably PHP
You shouldn't need to edit the ajax
because there'll be an event which the ajax activates which is probably handled by the PHP or at least by an if-else statement
damn dynamic coding, why is it so much harder? ;_;
12Why the hell haven't I eaten anything x_x
12TST always does this to me >v<
04It
04It's like WoW, except without the roleplaying
04It's like Facebook, except without the instant-messaging.
<~Articuno> Why the hell haven't I eaten anything x_x
rofl
04It's like an Xbox, only it can't play games/
04Ok I'm done
04Hey NS
the internet does that to me, except makes me not sleep
instead of not eat
04What do you think of the name Incencia?
it sounds not-Drake-like-and-unlively
Sounds like Incancerous
04not-Drake-like?
Try Incensia or Insencia
or even add an s to the end
04Well
04What about Laveda?
Lavada?
04Well
04those two names mean 'innocent', which is what the character is
don't talk to me about innocence
I'm sure as hell not
04The other two options are Kenya and Innocentia
actually I am
04XD
but hurp!
okay that was sarcasm
ahem
04Incensia looks like incense.
Hey
try Nevinost :p
04Insencia...I'm liking that
04Nevinost?
means innnocence in Croatian
04Where'd you get that?
04Uh
or innocence
04I can't imagine Spyro calling someone 'Nevinost' really/
that's innocence in english
04no durr
Inosan?
It's innocence in Haitan Creole
...Haitia
04Pronunciation?
Haitian
I-no-san
or you can use Sakleysi
04'ee-no-san' or 'eye-no-san'?
Which is icelandic
either, Drake :p
04ok now we're going too far from the norm.
Try 無罪
That's japanese
/me hides
04...
XD
or 무죄
/me gets our Google Translate for it's trusty phonetic reading
which is korean
lmao
04Once.
04It.
04LOADS.
04Bawww I can't copy it.
04Pronunciation of both NS?
04And meanings?
Draguskyl
uskyl means innocence
and Drag is the first 4 letters of Dragon
Drake lol
they all mean innocence
04innocent dragon
12Meowing Lugia = THE END OF THE WORLD!!!!
/me imagines Spyro passionately moaning 'Draguskyl'
04No.
Yeah, because we all want to watch dragons doing what I drew 2 years ago
imagination
04XD
04Incencya is nice.
04I'll go with that
Articuno'd probably baww over me ):
/me hides
ew Drake
04Probably
Dragovine
Dranevine
2 Drake
@ Drake*
04u srs?
y not?
04BECAUSE IT'S WEIRD
salavene :p
04Salavene...
04What would be a shortened version of that?
04Sal? Sala?
Sal
or you can use Solavene
and use Sol
or Sola
04Solavene
04Sola
04hmm
04It works, since Lia is technically the shortened version of Illia.
;p
Or Drake
you could use Draconis or Dragoran
/me hides
04Ice/Earth dragon named Solavene
04NO
04NO
04We'll use Rathicus
/me FLEES
Sure
or use Merigal
04nonotreally
:p
I was being sarcastic
04I like Solavene
have fun
04I will
04;3
why does ice/earth
/me hides
04Because I haven't sorted out the element between those two
remind me of Combat of Giants - Dragons?
04May needs to finish that goddamn design
lol
And heh
I bet you that Solavene is just a wannabe me
and the Spyro is you
;3
04We have a severe lack of ice and earth characters
04Oh definately no
XD
04Solavene is the exact opposite of you
I'm sad
04Petite, innocent, delicate...
but i'm all of those
you insult me
04Spyro is a sarcastic smooth-talker and knows how popular he is
Then okay
I'm Spyro and you're Solavene
04...no
GENDER SWITCH, GO
gender bender hurp durp
04We'll call you Cynder and me Espen
04So I get to be an all-powerful jerkass.
04And you get to be an angsty b!tch who is too powerful for her own good.
I'm Ken/Digimon Kaiser/Emperor so I'm even better
I kick your face with my Dark Rings and Spirals and I can control you!
BOW TO ME
/me imagines Spyro and Ken in the same room
/me shudders
imagination
04It hurts sometimes
yeah I know
it experiments waaaaaay too much
04Far too much
But sometimes it's interesting
04Very rarely
04So Solavene still means innocent right?
Obviously you're lacking
04innocent/innocence
nevine means innocent
in croatian or something
sala = salamander which is related to dragons
just converted to sola
:p
04Ah
04nicer
04nice*
/me hugs
04Thanks
Giovanni shrugged slightly. "We are outlaws, Ash," he reminded his nephew. "We must expect the opposition of society in general. Now I think there is something particularly on your mind."
YAY OUTLAWS TOPIC
/me hugs back
anytime, Drake :p
04XD
04You and your outlaws
but ):
hey, you know my look/take on outlaws and freedom, Drake
04Hey I'm not dissing you
you should know full well by now that it's justified
04Of course I do
not that it needs justification but ANYWAY
04I was just pointing out the fact you'll jump on that topic whenever you can
Because I'm pretty...what's the word? outspoken on my philosophies :p
04Oh most certainly
04And for a moment I thought you were going 'Because I'm pretty, oh so pretty'
you know I know I'm not pretty :p
04Stop putting me in awkward positions
04I know you're doing it intentionally
Am I that predictable? :p
04You're becoming predictable
04Or maybe I'm getting to know you better. Not sure.
But then the fact remains that that wasn't intended to put you into an awkward position, Drake :pp
so therefore, you're predicting me wron
wrong
04Stop lying. I know you're lying. I'm psychic.
I'm not lying >:
If I wanted to put you into an awkward position I would go all-out
for me it's everything or nothing :p
04I'll keep that in mind
haha, Drake
06:3
06My mind took that in the wrong AKA fun way
rofl
heya Ash1986 :p
hi
can you please send me my login details for the forum?
Eh, Ash1986?

12why?
07it's very minor though but geez Lakorv XD I've told him before not to text me so floofin' late
07late being past midnight because I'll be trying to sleep them :p
12XD
07Oh well XD
07So.
07Dinner was good.
07But Articuno, is it weird for you to start talking to someone again after a while of little communication?
07I always notice that I kind of have a hard time lowering my barriers immediately
12Ihave no idea hwat you're on about
07well
07I'm just noticing that if I've not talked to someone for a while, it takes me a while to relax around them, to get used to talking normally again
07wonder if that's just me though.
12Oh I see
12Well, I've never noticed how I behave so I can't say
07m'kies

Seen all the episodes?
yeah
w00t
LIKE A BOSS
DAYUM RAIT
Pachelbel's Canon's basso continuo, of course
still sad that the GIGA DRIIIIILL BREEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK! Dai-Gurren Special wasn't in the anime though. That attack is batshit crazy and would've made the show EVEN MORE AWESOME.
hey FF
Yo
Yup, that's the one, freezeframe. Just hours after you mention it, I see it repeated about 50 times XD
Did you count? :P
nah
I think when I get married, I'm going to request not having Pachelbel's Canon in D. Hopefully my other half will agree.
Too busy being bored and looking at the grass on the floor :P
FreezeFrame - sounds like a plan
You don't notice the basso continuo until someone points it out, either.
They then played vivaldi's spring, followed by summer, for the exit of couple. 0_o who chose dese songs?
true dat

12I particularly like ATi for some reason though xD
Ohai everypony!
Oh hey htere Pegacorn
hey Pegacorn
12I think NVidea graphics cards cost more though
Streaming Gurren Lagann on my Synchtube. Wanna join?
06they do, but it's worth it
13Why is it that the one game for Xbox that interests me is exclusive only to that console .w.
(yes I got my own Synchtube)
: P
Guess what?I'm downloading the Duke Nukem Forever Demo on Steam!
13If it was on PS3 as well (like a lot of their games are) I'd be happy
11Good
meh
it has a demo? yay~
13since I'd like a PS3 for my next birthday
06you can pay for the brand, but paying for NVidea is worth paying for
13but nooo
I heard DNF sucked.

Screw what other people think of games,you should judge by yourself to know if a game sucks or not.
^
Pegacorn, I saw gameplay.
I didn't like what I saw.
Not one bit.
Why not?
dermathil - movie intro is antispiral killing worlds ;__;
06What game is that AE? o.o
Pegacorn: because it is a mix of what made shooters of all eras bad.
They took the worst of everything together.
ROW ROW FIGHT DA CRITICS.
12Floof wars
13Samurai Shodown Sen
/me runs
Life bar and regen health
13My friend recently got an xbox and has that game
13and I loved it, |D
(AND health items)
13-,
(also, linear sections, not as free as Duke 3D)
What pegacorn said
That's what helps you win at a game!
12bbl
Oh and Dermathil - ah showed pegacorn a /v/ video with fightdapower music pegacorn keeps quoting. Yet Pegacorn, you still have never seen the anime have you?
Never seen Gurren Lagann yet.

Hey Barry
You ready to join the marathon?
12esppyyyyyyy

7You mean Idol Springs?
6Yeah,that :P
7I like Shady Oasis
6That's the place with those hippos,isn't it?
7Yes
6Heh,yeah it was pretty awesome :3
6But chasing those thiefs there was annoying as hell..
7Tell me about it. At least I know a way to get the egg from the thief in Bamboo Terrace without chasing him
6Heh,yeah :P
6I tried that once but I couldn't see the egg hatch.. D:
7You know the thief trick?
6With the swim in the air glitch
7Did you know you can swim in the air in Crystal Islands?
6Yep :P
Dermathil, you kinda disappeared
6I've only managed it like 2 or three times though..
7Yeah, it's hard. But it's better than paying Moneybags to open the bridge
6Basically as far as I know I've done every swim in the air glitch so far..even the Lost Fleet one,though I didn't manage to keep it for too long.. ._.
6True.. :P
7A cloud cat also has a glitch
6Idk why but I really feel that there /is/ a way to swim in the air in Spooky Swamp.. :O
6Cloud cat? o.o
7http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=156GVI5IQN0
7Fluffy is a cloud cat
/me has food
7The wiki calls the fairies in Cloud Spires Cloud Cats
/me steals it, then returns it.
6Aa..that's what they are..I thought they were some kind of pixies or something
7Well, what their real names are remains unknown. One sorce calls them Weather Imps
6:O
7Still, what do you think of the video I showed you? It's got a glitch in it
6Pretty weird! :P
7I know
6It'd suck if you had that happen to you the first time you played the game.. :O
7That's true
anybody who wants to take part in the gurren lagann marathon in my Synchtube?
bbl, haircut and groceries :3
6I love how it has so many glitches..They're all fun to do.. :3
Bai
7Yeah, but they can sometimes be annoying. I lost data for one gameplay after accidently activating the Swim in the Air glitch in Mystic Marsh
6D:
6I wish I could try the RR glitches out..
DO IT GUYS
6Meh..That double jump is so awesome.. :O
7Yeah. Thanks to it, I've been able to avoid Moneybags in Glimmer, Crystal Glacier and Magma Cone
6win!
6Crystal Glacier was an awesome level.. :3
7It is
7I have to go now
6It's another favourite.. ^^
