Ninjapony: I have no problem with a wink
I just feel they went too far a bit
I loved the scene. One improvement could've been slightly higher pitched Derpy voice
I don't want them to do what we want. They did just fine on their own instinct

Dermathil: I hate it as well, with a passion, in point of fact, but hey, not everything on the stream is tailored to your specific tastes. We'd all be bored otherwise.

Wub wub wub you all

0,5All I see is a blank white screen on the stream

Well, not always
But most of the time
And a really good soundtrack~
bai everypony
ta ta IshBestPony ~
Bye
*hai
XD
Hey
Oh hello IshBestPony ~
Bai IshBestPony
0,5SuperBrony64 were only getting a white screen -_-
Can you run the game windowed SB?
I have an urge to download the soundtrack to MOH now~
Nah multiplayer MOH can't be windowed
I might have to edit the settings file of the game.
its idiotic
0,5Hey, im curious about something...
There's no option to do so in game
There's some program to force windowed on fullscreen games
there might be when actually playing though
0,5With Shy leaving the team, who's going to take over the Regulars room?
Can't remember what it was called
0,5Not that it matters. Im just leavin' this here^
And there it goes~
I think I don't much like mips.tv
how many Harddrives do you need man?
10,02Can you swap embeds to LS if this doesn't work?
Why? Stream service shouldn't make a difference?
10,02Well, using Procaster might make a difference
Ahh
Can do
0,5Uuuuuse the procastah
10,02Lemme first see if I can change settings though
But eugh, procaster
:P
you can stream in fullscreen using procaster btw
10,02IKR
10,02But it's so nice and purdy :3
/me has procaster and finds it very nice and tidy
07,01I guess one of the admins
...
so the first post isn't the episode followup...
I kinda like ProCaster. It does what it should, on balance.
ack
'oh no'
I think the episode followup was the "DERPY DERPY DERPY (etc)" post.
I'm sure a more expansive one may follow.
Eventually.
oh it will
Derp!
10,02Alright, time for Google to find answers
Google away`!
~!*
But you can't get FULL HD NEW OCD DECAIDO quality with procaster.
Derp derp de derpy derp.
yay for Google Chrome
0,5Now that I think about it, does anything need to be done at all? Its just ownership, the mods are still mods.
Seth said that he'd put the chimicherrychanga in in the episode followup originally but decided to give it its own post
do a barrel roll
SuperBrony64: If you want the program to force windoed, it's dxwnd
0,5Yeah it doesnt matter.
That Chimicherrychanga looked good
07,01indeed
mmmm....chimicherrychanga
Speaking of which I'll be back later~
What am I watching?

That's where all your viruses are stored
Then it'll work
Hurry SuperBrony64 this bomb is gonna explode any minute!
No AlLcApS LC
so what's the difference between @ before the name, % before the name, or + before the name?
@ is op
/me needs hugs and kisses
% is half op
10,02I can only find System16 and System64
@=op, %=halfop and +=mod
/me hugs IshBestPony

Shit Dermathil , get it together.
Same thing as in lowest rank!
How is mod lowest rank? :P
The next time someone goes "No allcaps hur dur", this person, by rule, is forced to smack himself in the head?
(With the exception of the mods, clearly)
Lasharus: "No allcaps hur dur"
/me needs moar hugs and kisses
/me smacks himself in head
Hilarity.
Thank you though. :p

Oh yes, let's be literalist.
no matter hwo much I refresh, it's still showing mips.tv

It's not funny anymore. The first time someone possibly cracked a smile, and it might even have not been you but someone else. By now we're just cringing.

I am confused
0,5REFRESH if you dont see the Wii
10,02That's LS autoplaying recorded content
I do now, I'm just wondering why it switched in the middle
10,02After I shut down from going live, it continues playback of the auto-pilot content
10,02So basically, there's a stream even when I'm not live.
Er, I did, but now it's taking awhile to load or do anything. :|
/me pokes FF.

He just got pwned and then got up like nothing happened. >_>
10,02;____;
Simon got lucky there
0,5Wait, I thought SB was playing as Simon
Obviously Simon's not easially distracted by boobs

Now his ancestors are shamed...
Good job

It's like if someone took Pony vs Pony and made it worse.
I wonder if anyone takes time to read that inbetween the puzzle thingies
so fast the stream cant keep up
05nopony stops therock, NOPONY

Yeah, this is ALL the game is, apparently.
The stream's saving us.
If you saw this as it truely is, you'd all turn to stone.

Hi Shy!
Eeyup, the intro is longer than the game.
10,02So yup, 24 hours streaming in a row O___o
Hey Shy ~
/me waves
Octomania is best game
That's impressive.
Mods may be asleep though :(
wait, this is a game?
10,02Yup
unfortunately
i thought it was a tv show
It's a game about tacos.
24hr stream > celebrate with Octomania
:3
I think the old E.T. game for the ATARI was better than this
and that game sucked hard
I've played it
ET was the best game ever
I dont know TMoW thats pretty shitty
Legend has it that there's a giant pit in the desert filled with unsold copies
[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn: dot dot dot son, dot dot do
t
Atleast Octomania has tacos ET dont got nothin
i heard it was in mexico
We should watch Doctor Who: Dreamland
bad animation, good David Tennant
10,02I bought it $10 new when it first came out
and 10 dollars worth spent SB
so....did anyone elses stream derp or am i alone?
I have derp
I gots derp
That's an expensive doorstop!
$10
10,02IKR
Speaking of which... I could use one
What were you thinking when you bought it? "Hmm, this looks like a great game"
Not the worst game I've ever played though.
Worst was this one... It was like, the first video game tournament game
they gave away cool stuff
silver sword encrusted with jewels with a gold hilt
http://i44.tinypic.com/2ecznlx.jpg what do you guys think?
cool stuff.
But the game was all like... WTF IS THIS???
QWOP is best game ever
10 bucks? I'd say that it was worth it, but then, there's indie games like Terraria that put this to shame, so I can't even say that
10,02Alright, almost setup to play Heroes
Sylar???
Wait HeroeS?~
Hiro
Peter?
I've never seen that before?~
Clair
!~*
05sb
05wanna skype while at it?

/me is going to go play Fallout 3 soon~
10,02Nah, I'm too shy ;___;
05no you're not dude dont lie
/me is probably onna play some GTA 4
Sometimes I like to put a fake cigarrette in the corner of my mouth and complain about zombies and being old and stuff
Wrek: But I'm Awesome!
just like Bill
10,02Either way, it takes a bit of extra effort to get it to work, and I don't feel like talking right now >_<
05fine.
I hate zombies. I hate trains. I hate planes.
That's francis
Bill's the old guy
I know that~
<3 Francis~
Bill hates stairs though
Bill's oldness :D
ahem* Pillis here~
"What if just your beard starts to turn? Can I shoot that?"
Well, time to shoot things!
10,02Stream is up
WOO
Oh, THAT Heroes
Win, SB.
05techniocally I win CriticKitten
05cause im teaching him how to play
05etc etc
Okay, then Wrek wins.
Alright, how does it look? Sound aright?
:>
Wrek always wins
^
05sound works
05but for osme reason your game scales weirdly
Looks good, sound is working
05oh well
Wrek wins everything because he draws R63 so every argument is valid towards him.
"I draw G5 Ponies. Your arguement is invalid"
05ok sb
05load game
05multiplayer
05the rest is the same as yesterday
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geTCP666Yf4

05you wont be able to re-hire
hey
anyone know about HITS?
HITS?
Does it matter what hero I hire?
idk
/me is going to play L4D~
05yes
05cause heroes gian exp
05and level up
05and get better
05so you want your heroes to survive
05the human one
05is better for you
05since it will keep your human troops morale up to have a human hero
05remember to upgrade your troops
05buy a barrakcs to access knights
05a yellow bar means that the buildign is maxed
05green that you can afford it
05red and a cross is that you miss the tech to build it
/me giggles
05red and a coin stack with a cross means you cant afford it
Ohey Vi
06I am in Deutschland now my loves <3
Dat DerpyHooves`
hey Vi
06I have been lurking . .
06tired x.x
Congratulations! Give it a big hug for me :3

Hey all.
Have you had any fun DerpyHooves`?
that feeling when I recognize a unit by its movement sound
05next couple of rounds focus on getting your town into a capitol, look on the capitol buildign and see what buildings you need to build it.
05thatway you increase your income of gold
So... Lego is making "Girl's" Toys now. The line is called Lego: Friends.
I'm playing Heroes III DerpyHooves`
those butterfly women are bullying that one dude
and now they are dead
Omg, wut?
oh hae a crash happened
CRASH
Maybe Lego should make a show that promotes their product, and market it to boys, so a bunch of women aged 13-30 will start buying legos?
bugger!
silly lego, they do not need to pander to girls, we are quite capable of improvising pirate ships und military bases with huge tubs of assorted pieces
yes
10,02Darn
thats what I used to do
/me hugs Shizuka
05just rejoin the game sb
/me hugs SuperBrony64.
welp
sooooo many hugs
That's what I'm saying -They have licensed products that appeal heavily to female audiences.
i miss 3do
/me is hugged
You did well for a first try, now you go back and show them what you're made of!
:P
i love the older games that think IPX was going to succeed
/me hugs Ictiv in place of SuperBrony64
Harry Potter, Pirates of the Caribbean... but instead they wanna make PINK BRICKS.
06Which Heroes? ;A;

/me now wants a carousel boutique set.
Byeee, Vi
alrighty Vi
take care Vi
I'll play against you Vi!
But I still need to learn more about the mechanics of this game...
This is my second time playing it
SuperBrony64 what game type is this? e.g. RTS?
first time it crashed, rite?
shell be back at 8 SB
i think i played a heroes game once... may have been 3 cause this music seems so familiar
I think, yeah.
This is a pretty cool game.
/me has never played Heroes
:(
The only RTS i ever play is Command and Conquer due to its epicness (except C&C4)
06<3 C&C
I'm not familiar really with older computer games though :/
DerpyHooves` Generals 2 + Frostbite 2 engine <3
06SuperHeroes64 wir play when I come back <3
Alright! :D
und then vivi challenged sb to a d-d-d-d-duel!
doo doo pe doo pe doo pe doo doo
I'll lose, but it will be fun to play ^_^
that's gonna be stuck in my head now
C&C 3 is one of my favorite games. ^^
Generals too.
CriticKitten i loved the campaign of C&C 3 and Generals is my favourite.
Hopefully, EA wont ruin Generals 2.
When Wrek gets back, tell him I went for food as well :P
/me goes to play some TF2
05yum
05juicy bits of pork with goat cheese and pasta
05anyways sb
05lets roll!
DWR: I hope not but am not holding my breath after having seen the release of Tiberium Alliances
I loved Red Alert.
05dont run into the bloody archangels now
Dat Hell March.
Hey everypony! Whats going on?
05waiting for SB to stop being afk
What game is this? :o
he went for food
05Heroes of might and magic 3

05also DerpyHooves`
RaveBrony: Heroes of Might and Magic 3
er.... 3
05we could restard if you wanna join too
05start*
get use to that sound, btw
Oh, Ive never played Heros :(
RaveBrony you should try it XD it's cool
'tis a shame. Great game
Alright, let's roll.
Since Wrek is just in the process of addictifying Sups, maybe he will be available to play with later?
05dont run into the angels unless you KNOW
05you have enough to deal with them
Looks like I get another chance to not eff this up :P
05build up bild up build up
05Im always up for a game of heroes
/me challange considered.
How much is the game? Maybe I get it for another time :P
05alwasy engage SB
*Ill
05you want the experience
05aswell as always picking experience when finding chests providing gold/exp
05dunno how much it costs today
05had my copy for ages
Anyways, why are you guys playing HoMM3? Isn't 5 or 6 better~
05nope
$10 on GOG
05# is the best one
053*
05gameplay wise
Wel l ididn't play Heroes in atleast a year, probably a lot more since people who would play it slowly disappeared BUT should I get my copy back from my father and fianlly get my computer fixed, I migh take you up on that offer Wrek
Oh?
05yes
Now I'm interested. I got pretty good at 5, never tried 3
I like 5 best myself, but 3 is definitely a solid title
055 and 4 were so simplified
05imo
05though i kind like how 6 plays out
05but i miss the recourse hadneling
05its a very economic game
Well... If you learn a couple of spells and stuff at 5, the rest is way too easy at any difficulty
I think Heroes 3 was the game that got me into fantasy as a whole
6 did some stuff good and some stuff oddly.
05i did liek the whole custom hero thing though
Yeah.
That was a good move.
Was first game that managed to convince me to read its text-cutscenes
Hmm.. there are some expansion packs for HoMM3 right? are they any good?
05always remember to restock your troops when you can sb :D
05the expansion were neat
05but
I foresee losing
SuperBrony64: Do not give up
Let them come.
Not if you're smart about it.
let them be sure
05the new race wasnt that interesting and hard to play
but show them the white of your teeth
hmm ok
05the new maps for multiplayer were awesome
and make them fear your steel
fight well!
05but as for campaign it wasnt that much either
well
HITS is proving a bust
05kill the weaker stacks first SB!
the interface is busted
(Does SB have any spells so far?)
05i dunno
05havent teached him about that yet
I enter in the correct infor
Okay
05he's still graspign combat and economy
they tell my the info is INCORRECT
Yay!
argh
See?
That sulfur mine is MINE
darn...
If you're smart about troop movement and such, you can usually win even if outnumbered.
05remember to focus getting a capitol SB
05you need that extra gold income
Where are the requirements?
05hold right mosue button on the city hall
05while inside the buy buildings
05SB
05listen to me!
05go inside the buy building menu
05hover the city hall building to see the requirements
Sorry, there's a lag in the stream between what you're telling me and what you see
All I need is money
05yes
05so
05save up
05and next round get city hall
05then see what is required to get the next level which is capitol
CONSPIRACY!
o.o RAWRity wut
RAWRity: Shhhh Serious war making is at hand
CONSPIRACY http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tzI1iysdkA
*Shifty eyes* It's not a conspiracy, move along.
05is uggest getting more troops before going further north
Pro-tip: All that glitters is usually stuff you can steal.
How do I build a castle?
05you upgrade the keep
All you have to do is take a ton of Granite, add it to the mix
05the citadel
Ha
05in this case
Good one MirrorImage :)
05no need ofr more heroes SB
05make sure you can support the ones you have first
Just looking around
05but you are getting better
Ill need to wait until next round for the castle
05slowly graspign the concept :D
IKR, all thanks to you ^_^
05once you reach capitol you should have enough income to buy all weekly troops
05and upgrade most buildings
05yfw SB had a better startign location than I
steal the llake
its glittering
go steal it
I did already :P
Where do you get this game these days anyways o.o
Hence the blue flag :P
oh
See? Told you. If it glitters, it's usually stealable.
:D
You can get it at GOG.com
=legal? :')
Awesome site where you can download old games legally.
You have to buy them ofc
I wish the centaur was glittering
I know I have Heroes 3 somewhere, but I must have misplaced it
05hey sb
05provide people with the link i gave you if they care to join
05best bet if you want compabillity
well it'll take another 30 mins before i've got the game anyways... dunno if you'll still be playin then
Will do
05next keep upgrade is castle sb
Next upgrade is Capitol :D
05then you can focus on your troop producing structures
05and stack up massive armies on your mane hero
05and kick some creep arse
IKR
argh
my is my stream so laggy?
Ohai otakon :3
it's a bloody old PC game
hi SuperBrony64
damn it
So, this map I'm on, am I limited to only the area that I see?
05nope
05there is an underworld area aswell
05fidn the gate and you find me
Oh cool!
05i pickeda small map for a reason
Seems like there's not much to do outside of waiting to upgrade stuff though...
05some maps utilise the whole udnergroudn as anotehr map
For now I mean
That's cool!
05some utilize the undergorund for tunnels of travel
4000 Gold a day! :O
05eeyup
Save up for that one, it's great
Sure I trade some of my stuff in for gold?
Hai LC
0,5Dat timing...
05nope SB
05well
05you can
05but the inflation is rediculus
05not worth it at all
You can sell resources on the marketplace if you're desperate for coin
Is there really anything I can do besides just wait?
Can I fight those storm elementals?
explore things
/me quietly enters room
05hmm
With that army? Probably don't want to...
05id would build more army first
/me waves at Dken2021
05they can be nasty
I'm waiting for Capitol before I expand my exploration.
Alright.
Elementals are pretty tough units.
hey Ninjapony
Next time I should try that program that Dari told me about to window this game
Then I can scale the game better on the stream
:P
Dat dari
indeed
0,5Speak of the dari you mean
lol
O u
Same thing.
yes
0,5*bad joke is bad*
> : )
bad joke is true
CAPITOL TIME
finallly MOOLAH!
05thing is SB
inb4 no allcaps
05you can alreayd run it in windowed mode
05BUT
Inb4 GODDAMMITDARIBOT
05it requires you to set your screen to 16 bit color
goddamnitDARIbot
I see
little variance this time
That sucks
05and if you do that FML wont capture the image of the screencap
can't he just adjust the compatibilty?
to ignore color settings for the game?
Well, I'll fiddle around with it...if I did the screen tracking, it tracks both monitors I have.
05oh well
05keep playing now SB!
OK
05worst case i can take over the stream

Ive never played a game with such gameplay.
09,01by sleeping, of course
09,01DOHOHOHOH

Wrek, you should try exercise if you have insomnia... works for me
^^
05but i dont have insomnia

09,01no, but really, eat grapes
inb4 SB manages to die

0,5What is this place, filled with so many colors
equestria
Pallet town of course
09,01no, really, grapes have this chemical compound on their outer cover...it's been proven to be a relaxant and to aid with sleeping disorders
05mfw that iamge reminds me of Myst
Wrek: This is totally what I thought of when you said you were spreading the gay on me
dat vermin supreme
the air elementals should have an animation of rainbow dash flying around them :D
06I am here to play Heroes :3
Wrek: you sleep?
why?
06AHA! The hero has arrives!
06arrived*
staying up is much more fun!
Well, he says free ponies for all, so he's got my vote
0,5Not your average normal everyday
Yay for DerpyHooves`!!

05:D
/me giggles
IKR

06>Vermin Supreme
Hey what's the video requesty channel?

Vermin won't win, sadly.
05hey Violet

I haven't seen a single Vermin Supreme ad in my state - Texas
Mmkay. thanks SuperHeroes64
P0n-3 #vinyl_scratch, but not now
I know they're playing whatever this is for now, but I want to request something for after.
09,01all this talk about Heroes is making me feel left out. WHERE DO I PURCHASE IT AND HOW MUCH DOES IT COST.
vivi is hier und sie ist ready to hero some might und magic?
yo
Vermin Supreme is virtually unknown here
Equestrian's Gloves?? O___o
silly DCD, you could go for the 'buccaneer' discount
Vermin Supreme is man running for USA president.
So whats up?
I'm back~
the sky
Because he ran in NH.
09,01but would that allow me to play with mon gars? ;A;
That's why.
Witty comment.
:p
So...
the chat died
that it did
No it didn't!
like all of a sudden
Oh really?
09,01but yeah.....can someone point me in the direction I need to go in order to play with the guys?
up
or down
or left or right
Cupcakes... Rainbow assorted cupcakes :)
So I made chimicherrychangas
they were good
I don't really know, I bought this game like 12 years ago at a garage sale
05inb4 sb killed himself on the angels again
xD
Yep, and I'm going my gf wants to go look at clothing
09,01oh, it's an SRPG? I'm good at SRPGs : 3
I'll be back later guys.
09,01Needs more CLOSE GAME LIFE and Crow Broust blowing shit up everywhere forever though
Something... to do with apples?
09,01...I really should finish streaming Z2
Yay ^_^
Actually don't think I wanna know.
its a turn based strategy game with rpg elements
Wow, SB didn't die to the upper tier unit
T_T I don't understand this <.<
no ones does
05angels are the final tier for humans
05archangels are their upgraded version
I can easily play Heroes 5 but I just keep dying at this 1. =-=
Hm
I feel the urge to start a movement
oh well. take 3.
a movement where we write tavern songs to the Glory of SuperBrony64
So...
How bout dat derpy?
is this campaign , single map or multiplayer ?
05come on then sb
05he's playign against me
05tommy
Afternoon everypony
hey LunaTheBeloved
ding ding ding ding ding
[SWAG]Haku: Which derpy?
Which one do you think?
...
Hooves man, Hooves
Hey [SWAG]Haku
I mean on what insance do you bring it up?
insantce*
IDK
I just feel like doing some ranting
As in previous episode or as general?
previous ep
05waht is SB doing?
Didn't like cameo?
i saw the chats reaction
yes and no
10,02Grabbing a link for DCD so he can play.
/me pats Haku on back.
054 player huh?
Me too mate. Yes and No. Me too
I loved how they did that, how they did what bronies always wanted
05all vs me?
05:D
05wait
but at what cost?
05VI is probably beast at this game
05hmm
05Vi vs dcd and sb
This once dream achievement destroyed so many others
05ill cry in the corner for the whole gmae
0,5o.o
hai thar everypony :)
10,02Haha
05hey SB
hi ScootaChicken :)
Her name is Derpy Hooves, not Ditzy Doo. Therefore, Dinky Doo is not Derpy's mother
05gona host a new game so Vi can join
Hey all
daughter
Actually
Wicked. A BS mod battle. :3
10,02Okay, be sure to save this one though :3
What's a happening?
that is not true
05i did
???
Rainbow called her Derpy, granted
but not Derpy Hooves
Derpy may still be a nickname
hey everypony
so no break on that part... sill
Hmm. I'll have to go now, and will be back on Wednesday
Look, by the fanbase, Dinky Doo is Ditzy Doo's daughter. If Derpy isnt Ditzy, then Dinky isnt Derpys daughter
It's hard to imagine her as a mother figure. or atleast not the one we imagined
hi string String_Shredder
I like how every episode this season has shattered hundreds of fanfics - and we're only halfway through the season and the casualties continue to mounts ^_^
Cya everypony
bye Ninjapony, see you wednesday
r u guys rly debating wether derpy hooves is her real name?
no
Haku: She can be Ditzy 'Derpy' Doo. Meaning Derpy is a nickname she picked up that stuck
Whether or not she killed have the fanbase
I'm not debating, I'm just lining up possiblities
i geuss thats true
but still
it boggles the mind
What boggles the mind for me is that she's more mentally challanged now that Jim Carrey in The Cable Guy
it also killed off the whole 'derpy is mail-mare'
*walking into the conversation late* yeah, i think the toy department would have a hard time justifying printing "derpy" on a name card
she could still be a mail mare
Because we had another Mail stallion?
... Has anypony else been craving chimmi-cherry-changas?
Rainbow Dash is the weather mare for Ponyville
oh we are streaming an early Heros?
Not sure what was more shocking, Rainbow calling her Derpy, Derpy with speaking lines or the livestream reaction to it all
we haven't seen her do that very much recently
cool
Theres a team of whether ponies. RD isnt the only one
Who said the post office can have two employees?
I wonder if I have this one on disc still
what one it si
is it?
Ictiv: for that matter, who says the Post Office delivered mail that day?
I've been getting an urge to wrap cherry pie filling in tortillas, deepfry them and sprinkle them with cinnamon sugar.
Derpy was seen as a wheather pony.
P0n-3 never had chimmy chongas, but sounds delicioud
so who are we seeing right now ?
06I shall win!
I actuallly made some chimicherrychangas
they were good
[SWAG]Haku: I suppose that's good
Go for it DerpyHooves`
Dang...wish i had some :P
Oh buck, I should come to the next BroNYcon and set up a chimmi-cherry-changa stand.
look online for a recipe
aren't they basically just crude Churros without the cinnamon sugar Haku?
no
What factions are you all playing ?
Chimi Changas are a type of burrito
As long as they have the BroNYcon in a bigger place than the last one.
So they have a flour totilla
05SB
So...
The chat died again
oh Heros 3
Pickle barrel kumquat pickle barrel kumquat pickle barrel kumquat pickle barrel kumquat chimmi-cherry-changa!
I don't know if I have 3
So what are you guys ding?
/me wonders who to root for.
I found 1
...
MY GOSH what's happening on that desktop background!
I spy with my DJ eye a sultry pony.
P0n-3: The image looks better with Luna in it.
[SWAG]Haku: I thought... What weather ponies don't do is help with delievery. I think she eitehr did the lightning by accident, or she works multiple jobs
:D
Which actually would enfoce the single mom imag
yeah i geuss so
So...
(I'm really working corners here, this episode nearly crashed Book II of Chronicles of Equestria... Then i realized, maybe it improved it!... We'll se)
Ictiv: how so? i haven't read CoE
0,5otakonisracist.avi
MirrorImage: Well that would be spoiling it. Besides I'm still just writign Book I
what LordCelestia said
stop that!
no
lol LordCelestia XD
LordCelestia: That'sRacist.gif
I said NECROMANCER!
otakon doesn't like negromancers
NECRO!
Hmmm cherry-changa? Or chimmi-cherry? Cherry-changa, chimmi-cherry. Cherry-changa, chimmi-cherry.
damn it!
Or chimmi-cherry-changa?
and then the chat came to life
That's a good question, really. What do I call them.
what who doesnt like a neck romancer
that's needs to be EQD's next poll
i call them chimi charrey changas
Haku: Funny thing? Came to life when Otakon said "Necromancer"
its fun to nsay
Hm....
"So which is it? - Chimicherry, Cherrichonga, or Chimicherrychonga?"
/me debates.
chimicherrychanga
otakon is magic. It's canon
Chimmi-cherry-changa might not fit on the wrapper.
I kinda like cherry-changa.
CCC's are good
Fianlly I have an ally in the magical arts.
Oooh! I could do that! Put CCC on the wrapper.
Congratulations otakon! You can be my sidekick!
I can't decide who to root for. ;_;
what?!
how?
I could make kid-size ones too and call them Cutiemark-Crusader-Chimmi-Cherry-Changas!
awww i wanted to be Ictiv's sidekick
[SWAG]Haku: Do not fret! I'm awesome enough for up to 3 sidekicks
So then I geuss were a team then!
beyond that, I need to officialy start a fan club
I am Haku, the sexy one
I shall call you "Faceman"
Girls swoon at the sound of my voice
(or was it The Face?)
otakon can be the planing one who "Loves it when a plan comes together"
Hee! I could also make an apple-pancake verson of kaiserschmarrn and call it Jappleack Stacks.
I'll be the insane one
You are Haku , shapeshifting master of darkness
So otakon is the smart one then
about WHAT!?
Now if only we could get Wrek to be Mr W
So hard to read the screen....
Tommy I know. That is why i am sexy

Pi goes on FOREVER!
Maybe "Magnum Pi"
Darn. Tough choice. I like Necropolis and Inferno....
but definetly not a limited number
Somepony make a ponified pi
Haku: Too late Studio B did it
[2:55:29 PM] George Hicks(otakon): Pinkie Pi FOREVER!
Don't die too quickly, SB, I want to see those two duke it out. :D

Sorry bro, but they DID pick my favorite two factions
beatles refference warning: pi has 1 after 909
05i am inferno all the way
what is going on?
Ahhhh, heroes III. I should really reinstall that one.
well, ima go for now people. die
die?
why?
I adore using Inferno for damage in Heroes 5, and liked raising the dead for cheap armies as Necros. Humans were lame. :|
will do
/me dies
i meant bye
no!
i dont know why i sade die
/me sighs and casts resurrection on String_Shredder.
06<3
/me uses True Resurrection on String_Shredder
05you have to agree CriticKitten that humasn are a good race to start the game with
06Necrooo~
serious brain fart
Be more careful with your words [SWAG]Haku. And speak to you later. :)
True, Wrek.
DerpyHooves`: you know I meant Necromancers right?
im awake!
k bye people
Good for getting practice and getting used to the game.
Okay, before heading back to work I leave you with a bit of holy music to counter the whole lot of necromancy going on
But I still prefer the two y'all chose.
Some pony PMed me, if you want to reach me, use this username. I can't access the other one.
05i hate playing flux though
05elementals are so unreliable
's true
Phoenixes, Magic Elementals, Energy Elementals...
05im talking unit wise
06<3
05aslo
Hell, half the faction is immune.
Fair enough.
05i call shotgun for the holy grail xD
Ghehehe.
When I find myself in times of darkness, Pinkie Pie she comes to me! Gigglin' at the ghostlies! Can't you see?... And in my hour of troubles, Rainbow stands right besides of me. There will be a rainbow. Can't you see? Can't you see? Can't you see? Can't you see? Can't you see? Friendship's truly Magic! Can't you see.
That wa todays cermon
06Wrek: not if I get to it first <3
05<3
06I would even say. . . no hunting for it until SB ist on his feet? c:
Necro with Holy Grail. Or demons with Holy Grail. Tough choice as to which would be more blasphemous.
CriticKitten: Easy.
living is easy with eyes closed misunderstanding all you see
Holy Grail with Cthulhu, who is also eating a non kosher meal
What is the holy grail in this game?
05its a super item
Unholy enough for you CriticKitten? :D
SB: Make sure you check in with your castle every turn, to keep upgrading and whatnot.
aww yeah homm3!
Seems like ponies have heard of this game :3
Hell yes SuperHeroes64 :P
05its a classic game really
And yeah, I plan on doing that.
Once you got the money incoming at a steady rate you don't have to worry about it as much, but in the opening few rounds, you wanna get established.
This game is brilliant.
everybody should have heard of it
06I love this game <3
I love most instalments in the series.
I think the only ones I dislike are I and VI.
05i love the 3rd for its gameplay its really solid
hi
It's arguably one of the best games ever made, to be honest. >_> So it's no surprise people know of it
06I ddi not like VI. . . );
05but im a fan of the 6th aswell
05but 3 will always have a spot in my heart
06IV ist a pain .-.
I would be Wrek, if UbiSoft had released it in a working state.
I like 3 and 5.
06III und V are mein <3
ringo is best starr
Good afternoon Everypony!
Hi
ohai
Sorry, but heroes VI was a trainwreck, and it still has a huge amount of issues.
i like 3 4 and 5, never played the other ones
what game is this?
Ha, Vi barely ninja'd me. xD
09,01I had never heard of this game till a few days ago. Then again I grew on consoles and Fire Emblem, and recently migrated to mainly PC Gaming.
^
Wrek: Has the drinking started yet?
05ive been a computer gamer all my life
06you shall play soon DCD <3
06Wrek <333
what game is this?
05<3<3<3
06TRS80 all the way~
Ummmmmm.....
06c;
I have no idea
05:D
09,01I would've been a Computer Gamer earlier, but back in those days computers were too expensive to afford over here
heroes of might and magic 3
09,01consoles were, ironically, more economical
Hm....
ah
Here's a nice example of why I dislike VI most though Wrek.
ah.
On January 1st, the servers were down.
eeyup
ah
Shit happens, people call UbiSoft.
choo
It wasn't ironic, PCs are still more expensive than consoles.
They couldn't fix it. Why? Well, their tech support had gone home.
......
/me wishes this computer could handle gaming
Bless you
Assuming you want to game with them.
05protip SB: get capitol ASAP
/me flips coin.
rather, bless us
Haha, that's my goal right now.
excuse me
and this is why I don't like the inbrowser client
I've never seen these creatures before though so I don't know how tough they are...
Okay, since I suck at deciding things, I let the coin flip decide. Gonna root for the necropolis. :D
I would have kept talking to Luna
05troggs are easy
05but get more men
05your army is laughable
SB, stay alive long enough for me to watch a VioletPawnch of your army. :D
because the client doesn't notify of her disconnecting
06I can not see SBs army. . ?
Watch the stream Violet :P
Also, i'd nearly forget.
06Ah~
/me tacklehugs DerpyHooves`
I need noms
06I usually do not cheat. .
06but when I do. .
06es ist on stream
05mainly helping SB though Vi ^_^
:P
05its his second game
06dat slow animation speed. .
06ohbby. ..
I take it you always set it to max speed as well then Violet? :P
we don't care vi!
kick ass!
05hey SB, increase combat speend in the options xD
06if I use mein rush tactic I could violet paunch SB into oblivion. .
06but I love SuperBrony64 <3
06so I will not~
And that alone is why I couldn't win against most players Violet. :P
06Lasharus: Only way to paly
06play*
0,5Does anypony love me?
05inb4 "nope, archangels"
06makes it even funnier~
I'm a turtle at heart. Slow development and conquest is my style.
Which works perfectly against the computer.
06yay I know where SB ist!
or his
Against Players? God no. :P

LordCelestia No.

Oh lord, another Arrow to the knee joke, this time as a full name?
for those who are intrested: http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/63965-heroes-of-might-and-magic-iii
im making dubstep-like noises with garage band... I AM A GENIUS
One of these days I'm going to go to Bethesda's HQ carrying several large weapons for that...
"... tragedy struck today as the employees of Bethesda Softworks were all found supporting various missile-related knee injuries..."
wonder if they'll ever put an arrow joke in mlp?
future derpy gag?
does anyone else has frequent stream buffering issues or is it just me?
Derp derp de derpy derp.
laggy for me as well
09,01my chest feels odd
A heart attack, obviously.
09,01how unpleasant
09,01definitely not
too much HHHHHNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGG
NewDCD: That's not a good sign
09,01naw I caught a cold or something yesterday
Or have you read/ seen something cute recently?
NewDCD: Try to drink a glass of milk with a little honey in it
09,01I'm better now but I got this odd sensation on my chest
09,01not very intense
There's more symptoms to having a heart attack than an odd feeling on the chest
09,01but unpleasant
09,01yeah. Left arm is fine so
I'm trying to figure out what this chart means...
09,01plus Heart Attack chest pain is decentralized
/me giggles
09,01my sensation seems to be centered on the sternum
Rawketman: I don't think his heart can possibly grow any more sizes
On grounds that he'sa brony
09,01in any case
09,01bbl
wait... Vi has Isra as her main hero?
It's all love and tolerance until someone disagrees with you.
05mhm
Rawketman: (Bold text:) Are you disagreeing with me?!
: )*
Case in point.
Seriously Twilight. One of these days? Straight to the moon
so many friends
So many friends lost due to nick name :( I'll still hug you!
/me gives a hug to arrowtothebroknee.
Still can't change nicknames?
What a shame.
...ok then
Dat arrow the knee~
You can
Also, hello DerpyHooves` . I did not notice you there.
See?
Okay, actually you cant
I'm just magic
(But you can, I'm kididng)
What are you even writing?
(or am i?)
(Answer: I'm insane, don't trust me)
Something silly, I bet.
A story
Not too silly
just press F5 and change it on the log-in screen
Anything you wrtie is silly.
Well this is peculiar..
I didn't ge kicked but BronyState closed
huh...
Anyway, no it's not silly
/me is such a baws at music he can play While my Guitar Gently Weeps on piano without taking a single piano lesson in his life
it's actually pretty serious
not in the you know what kind way
RawketLawnchair: I can link you to some if you want
Are you a grim derp
06was I love about Heroes V
06take turns at the same time
no
Oh, is Vi streaming this?
05no
05SB is
05but
05me and vi are in the smae game as SB
Heroes V had a couple of very good things to recommend it for Violet.
Oh cool~
I don't write Grimdark... Well not GRIMdark.. Maybe sadish dark but none of it yet
But as a storyline and single-player fanatic, I must admit I found myself disappointed by the campaign. Isabel is probably the dumbest thing ever to hit gaming.
05my D&D stories tend to be dark
05for instance the rp the other day
dark is good, i like those stories... as long as they are written well
D&D is a bit different than magical ponies :)
D&D with magical ponies?
05it was with ponies silly
No, no.
my D&D stories tend to be filled with many, many character deaths. I make meat grinders.
Also: I envy you for getting to play D&D
06SB turn up animation speed .-.
05SuperHeroes64 TURN UP THE BLOODY SPEED
no D&D in hungary unless you're willing to drive 5 hours a day
lol
I already did...
05animation speed
05max it
05theere
Oh thank goodness.
05kill main burn
05maim*
Is Imaginarium of Dr Parnassus A or B?
Dem crystals.
IshBestPony, I'd have thought A, given its budget, but I'm not sure
So... how about them video games~
05im broke
05jsut got capitol :o
0,5So you guys...
0,5Patroits or Ravens?
05neither

This is going to hurt.

Hello Yellowquiet
Hey Yellowquiet ~

rugby is where its at
I think that Means Wrek this time...
/me has a manly tear dripping down face.
rugby is a mans game
But NO!
SuperHeroes64: HAS to win!
rugby is for proper lads
This is the dawn of his destiny!
05sb should retreat before he loses his best hero
This is the day he breaks into the world of Might and Magic.
The elements lead your hands SB!
you are playing so weird games here on bronystate XD
Bleh.
05old classics Yellowquiet :3
I wonder if those cupcakes I bought were bad.
So close...
Or muffins.
05and there SB lost his best hero
05well played gg
0,5BYEBYE
ta ta LC~
0,5Showah Powah
0,5!
._.
Showa time~!
0,5oh and Change
Silly SB.
<3
I saved my best hero at the fort
What is this i dont even
Where ever LC's sewage goes, fishes will die of happyness when bacon water hits them
<What is this.
so whose got the biggest army of the four?
05best hero =/= first hero
I don't even.
Still sucks to lose a hero at all
05best hero= the one winnign the most
You really don't want to get them killed period
So best super hero is... Charlie Sheen
his roast is the funniest thing I have ever seen
05btw
05im expecting the first paycheck form my new job this month
yay~
Awesome!
05this calls for a cigar
Indeed.
Indeed it does~
Gz Wrek. :)
The same as the one where you design weapons, or is that a sideproject?
05one and the same
Good ^^
Nice, making what you're good at, what you like, entertaining us AND making money off of it.
It's the Amer-...*clears throat* the Skandinavian dream
good evening
Hey derpy_pony ~

I think I only got 3 hours of sleep last night...
05not an excuse to be playign awefully xD

Umm, IshBestPony, do you mean "manner"? :P
Becauuse you just said that your huge-ass house makes you look adorable and snuggly.
IshBestPony: manner!
Which might be a bit of a stretch :P

Guys, I need to ask something: if a cult movie had a budget of 365k$ and is rated 7.5/10, is it an A or B movie?

Funner than hell though
Tsk, SB>

There was one level that had one giant pit that you hd to naviagate. We mostly died in there :P
Thanks Wrek

oh no, epic movie, that one's even more dull than disaster movie
so much hate for next weeeks lineup
i would have picked the princess bride
interior_gummy: you do noy show up in the userlist here
Life's a bitch emangamer
thats because next weeks lineup is shit
/me giggles
huh, i don't
Oh wait! I was thinking Disaster Movie!
i've gotten it before
brb, reloading my chat
I've never seen Disaster movie myself.
except Alice in Wonderland thats okay i guess
Lasharus, i love you too
I haven't seen Epic Movie
Meet the Spartans was a movie that didn't know when to stop jokes before they got old.
I hate all of those types of movies
06Wrek y yu leave? >:
I didn't say YOU were a bitch emangamer. Just that life generally is :P
ScootaChicken, well at least pretend like yoy are excited
Why did you leave Wrek?
interior_gummy: thats better
Wrek nooo...
but I'm not excited whatsoever
Epic Movie is a terribad film
someone needs to make up for the B movie next BMN, pick a enjoying B movie that's not so dull
and Alice in Wonderland is Tim Burton endulging himself

Damn~

at least something like the room is bad in a good way
There is another Alice in Wonderland we can watch, but I won't.

I just use the nick on other forums
Nyria: Nick is better, yeah. But it isn't quite... Bronyrifficaly speaking 'better'
don't think this site has one
I didn't like it that much~ It was a joke name, but I find that this name suits me better~
SuperBrony64, when are we getting that store you promised us?
05hosting now
I agree, more fancy
So do I refresh?
Oh nvrmind
Mind if I ask where did Nyria come from? Just off the top of your head or?
Oh, it came from me staring at a name generation program for 4 hours~
lol
Determination or boredom?
A little bit of both~
<3 This name ~
Wrek i see you
Hey I can read the screen now! :o
Btw Nyria, did you always use the ~ in the end of your sentences like you do now?
Oh, I didn't it~ It came with the name I guess~

:O
I was like YOU DON'T NEED ME >///<
Hm... DCD won't reply. Anyone got some health issues at the moment?
05PhrozenFire you go a long way here

...
a little bit tmi PhrozenFire
I am sticking to my girl
/me glomps DerpyHooves`
She got what she wanted
you went bra shopping with her?
this is new
Dang it... I've just got around to opening a bottle of good Apple Cider and I need someone to whom health I can drink to
Clothe shopping
I suppose I will drink to Derpy's good health then
oh
Please Dken2021 I'm embarrased as is.
To Derpy and Rainbowdash Ictiv?
ok, won't haggle you
She might be discreetly giving you the opportunity to figure out how the catches on bras work, sp you dont feel awkward fumbling with them, just in case you ever need to know, for whatever reason.
:) I know.
i should dl this game... it looks like fun
and brb
06<3 Ictiv|Writing~
It does look fun
/me raises glass
06es ist!
06Then ir all play
/me sips on a juice box
heroes 3?
DerpyHooves` you gonna do the radio show later?
To our firendly neighborhood jester and queen of hearts! A good helath and all that it implies to our liebling: Derpy Hooves!
/me drinks a glass of milk~
Oy Wrek, should you ever need someone to play this game with and the other mods can't be bothered, feel free to give me a shout. I've never played Heroes III online, should be a laugh. :)
Cheers~!
00,10wait this is what the game was?
now this looks interesting
/me hugs DerpyHooves` and Shizuka
/me pats Nyria on the back.
/me hugs nittany und vivi~
Now on to the tavern songs.
ummm..... to the sun, otherwise, we would be in the dark all day
We still didn't write one for SB's Glory
well it would wook more interesting but my stream keeps dying :(
To the SB's ORA~!
/me raises a cup of water
wait, 2 SB's?
ok, im dling the game now DerpyHooves` i just hope it will run on my computer
I mean
Mine keeps lagging Phase4
To SB'S ORA~!
Phase4: Me too
[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn: Eeeyup
/me drinks ORA~
whoa... right... forgot im also dling all of doctor who
i think i did play this game before...
i'm not sure if i should be happy or scared
/me keeps drinking from juice box
is it just me or is mips just randomly buffers whenever it wants?
it does
00,10I think the stream keeps buffering due to the shear amount of grafics it has to process from this game
Not just you Dken2021.
It's faintly annoying at times.
/me has it for me~
Sumica: mips wouldn't have to do any of that - your computer just sends it an image of your monitor after your graphics card does the rendering
I cannot truely enjoy the gameplay with that buffering
so any lag is your system not keeping up, not mips
I wish I understood what was gooing on a bit more
going*
To much loading in games... reminds me of Fallout NV~
00,10OI SB how long have you left the stream up?
I hated Fallout NV
Fallout 3 was waaay better
I could try to explain the whole thing IngloriousPony89, but frankly, it'd probably better if you got the game and played the tutorial :P
*probably be better
I actually liked NV, but those loading screens killed me~
I can imagine it would take a looong time :asharus
Skyrim has too many loading screens...or should i say the loading screens are too long
To the brotherhood of steel bunker~! *3 loading screens later*
at least the loading times aren't as plentiful like sonic 06
Wasn't as much as a waste of 60$ as LoTR: Conquest was though
00,10SuperBrony64, SuperBrony64_ I am now pinging both of you
10,02O___o
This is not a faszt game indeed.
o___O
*fast.
I wasted my money on RAGE, I don't play gaems that don't have story~ and the main character was meh~
games*
One moment IngloriousPony89, I'll see about getting you a link to gog.com's page for heroes III.
00,10When is the last time you stoped brodcasting?
I believe at most it costs $9,99
I like the easter eggs in RAGE
/me bought rage on the first day~ 60$
I'm thinking of getting Rage. Stil on the fence though :P
06get the copy wir have
thats a ripoff
00,10Mips keeps droping ofline and buffers you might want to find out why
Oh, and cool Lasharus
No worries. :P
mips seems to have fixed itse... nope nvm
/me has RAGE on his iPad >.>
I have RAGE.
Well, I picked RAGE up and put it down... never picked it back up again after that~
and then*
HoMM3 complete right DerpyHooves`?
Did you sell it Nyria?
Sounds a bit like me and HoMM6 Nyria. :p
I'm thinking to~
Yeah you should.
I haven't got passed the first disc~
0,5GUS

You mean the system will actually have a decent game on opening day?
Prasie LC~!

I wonder if they'll do Smash Dojo again?
3ds version sounds interesting
This only adds to my collection of the Smash Bros. games

Dken2021: smash dojo was as much advertising as it was a "guide"

Peanut Butter is now canon
I know, it was fun staying up and looking at what was coming up
/me is going to get a drink~

06of course loves
06i was in a fight

Okee. Was just getting a bit worried since it seemed it was running long.
05i hope its a bit easier to follow now when it isnt SB's small window
http://life.on.the.moon.is.great.i.know.all.about.it/ :O
00,10indeed it is werk
Yeah, can see things much more clearly.
Lulu: your hostname actualy resolves
I can see cleeeeaarly now the rain has gone...
00,10and then everything went black
someone OWNS that domain name
05and a bit faster game aswell
05:3
Phase4: they would only need to own the "about.it" part of it - that's the only part that resolves
00,10Geeee I wonder who could own that host, any ideas lulu?
the rest of it is server-side
Inb4 ception refernces

There was one~
Good enough for me~

Good afternoon everyone!
It's probably boredom..not that Heroes 3 is boring but there's nothing to talk about

hi Scoot-Scootaloo
Hey Scoot-Scootaloo ~

Thanks for the nightmares...
<3 that little guy~
10,02Well, we agreed on 4 PM though
Phase4: I wrote a script to check the RSS feed for EQD
/me yawns and starts to close his eyes
07,01nope
10,02And then delayed it by an hour
Great, I'm lagging a storm here. Brb
07,01he never responded
It posts in the chat when the RSS feed updates
07,01after the time change
God dammit I need to stay up
What time is it where you live TOY_PON3?
SB means that if he didn't hear about the time, he should have been here an hour earlier
Since what we did was move it an hour later.
10,02Yeah, but he would have showed up an hour ago
2:04 pm >.> I woke up really early..
0,5I shall name him scribbles
07,01Anyway I guess we have to start then?
07,01We can save the log for him so he can read up
LordCelestia: no... not THE SCRIBBLES!
I shall name him Squished. Because that's what Imma do to him.
So now you both have two castles, hm
logging as always~
I'll call him bitey, cause he's a big one
10,02Indeed, but he was the one who really wanted the meeting...
07,01Yes that's also true
10,02I don't know why he isn't here.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4tIi2Q_LWc <-- Behold.

'm thinking you mean in-game bug.
pinkie makes me happy
monorail!
Did someone mention a monorail?
Monorail cat
10,02I guess we can start the meeting then...but I feel it won't really be whole without him as he's heavily involved in the project...
Dken2021: dont give me credit, google told me
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF_yLodI1CQ
I need those DVDs of the old seasons
Ohh so that's what happend

What music is this?~
07,01We can of course re-schedule to tomorrow if everyone is okay with that.

04Oh

Unicorns are badass
06Nyria <3
04If it's anytime before 5, I can't make it
DerpyHooves` <3
/me is anoyed because he's going to end up on the roof again
I can't really make anything past 10, maybe 11 pm GMT, because there's no way to tell how long this it will go on for.
Ehm... How exactly, Phase4? :O
04Why not just aim for a weekend
07,01that's the problem
07,01the teammeeting
07,01is next weekend
07,0128th
04How about the weekend after this weekend?
I just realized
04Or even having the meeting on Sunday?
07,01I vote for Sunday
Diamond Tiara and her Father don't have the same last names
/me can never have enough meetings

10,02The Sunday after the team meeting?
What time on Sunday?

07,01thank you for your time

/me realizes she didn't have the stream muted... that music suddenly mixed really well with the sim city 4 OST she's listening to
The irony

I absolutely quiver at thinking about what the Main Chat was like.
There needs to be a Derpy Room now

its not only terrible but old too
What's the calculus version MirriorImage?
lol H2O too
An infinite number of men walk into a bar. The first man says "I'll have a drink." The second says "I'll have half a drink." The third says "I'll have a quarter of a drink." The Barkeep looks at them and says "You're all stupid" and pours 2 drinks.

orly?
13i barely made it out of that third part..

Shizuka you must do Vi's scheme
tone down the gray
13yeah ,15 is too bright

7,15thar?
this client still can't easly output colour and I'm too lazy to code it

13i can't do vivi's scheme .-.
oh
thats a shame
orange on the grey shizuka is using

that confit suit worked fantastic!
http://derpy.me/2o55K seems legit
Suprisingly
Phase4: yes it does

i feel really out numbered
3i'll stick with green
Zecora is Best Alicorn
3it's pleasant
13i like that dark green

New mods are never bad but too many mods is a bad thing
0,3that's the inverted me x3

I count 12 now
0,3I believe so
including the half ops
Phase4 and I were both the channel owners of a channel XD
0,3Let me make sure
seems very high for a chat that only averages 1-200 at the most except for new episode time
we joined at the exact same time
dah
so i was the channel owner
lol
sounds like he got you then Phase4
13yeah but the new episode time is the worst
But he couldnt kick me...
thats the thing
13und also there are many things to do outside movie night~
yep
0,3Yeah, there are 19 mods not including techies
yeah it is Shizuka, what all do mods regularly have to take care of though?
we're going to see ALOT of derpy for the next few weeks
19?!?!?!?
I think so
Wrek: if I may ask, you're modeling this for your job, as part of a video game? And.... how many polygons atm?
oh wait old staff
I would apply to help but I'm really bad at sticking to things these days
SlurryMoon And that leaves me to draw all of them.
13well, consider also the timezone differences
Thats a lot of mods SlurryMoon
Hoo-friggin-rah.
13there's enough of us now that there should be a couple mods available for all times

Fifth severe weather watch of the year is a Particularly Dangerous Situation tornado watch. Wow.
Lol :P
I'm guessing you livei nthe South?
No.
Then where?
Dashie_Dashie, you have convinced me to do whatever it takes to draw ponies!
The watch?
it was so hot here last night
http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/
That's the way I looked at it RaveBrony :D
Last night was saturdayyy, and we were watchin moviess
:)
IP Man!
so
What moviess?
I still need colored pencils though -.-
Ip Man!
Ive tried drawing ponies before, none are very good :(
kick ass!
^^
<3 that movie!
RaveBrony: practice
I refuse to do anypony without color
cept derpy
And 28 days later
seeing as she's grey
Well, where do you even Start?
/me giggles
sudden anime esque
Google search and trace pics?
tornados during winter. mmhmm
DerpyHooves`: why you google?
ahem
giggle
whats this song?
I look at pictures sometimes and free hand it
Winter finally hit here in Minnesota :P
It's beyond her garden
I dont have pony pics sadly :(
It's still not really winter here
unfortunately, I wasn't able to stay awake in both shows, so I slept through most of BMN
There have been outbreaks in the winter (Super Tuesday Outbreak for example (Feb 2008)).
it's hella winter here.
the crap RaveBrony, pretty much any picture i find now is a pony pic
anybody know what this song is?
hey RaveBrony you can draw ponies I did for the first time yesterday and it was pretty good :)
or, anypony i mean
i suck at drawing
The song is one of Wooden Toasters
Guess i just have to actually understand the way theyre drawn instead of trying to rush it xD
I'm pretty sure, the title has Carrot Top in it
sounds like a Pony remix ft. lonely island and Daft punk
beyond her garden?
Just search for Wooden Toaster on Youtube and you'll find it
RaveBrony just practice that's all
I reeeeally want to make my own pony... a raver with 2 glowsticks crossing for a cutie mark :)
sounds cool
Mmhmm
I want to do ones like those
but I need colors D:
I must practice then! and ill share it when i feel its good enough! xD
my cutie mark is a pen and paper xD because i do reviews :3
hmm//
:o
I wonder what my CM would be..
im honestly not sure what my cutie mark would be...
I know mine. It's a stack of books :-/
what would a RPG cutie mark look like?
Id make 2 ponies, a rave pony, and a elegant pony, worthy of canerlot :P
despite the lack of magic in this world, or my ability to use it, i tend ot think mine would be something magically related
I die
A die, rather.
:O
toy
yes?
I'll have to make myself as a pony now.
My Cutie Mark is a "Q" key on a keyboard, because I like to play God when I write.
:p
Good luck Dashie_Dashie :)
Awesome TOY_PON3 :D
Be sure to share it Dashie_Dashie!
I have no cutie mark...
sucks
:o
oh I will. :p

Shizuka: O U

/me thinks Shizuka should smack people around with a large motherboard
ITS MORE THAN LIFE
GOOD GOD Wrek YOU sure are TAKING YOUR sweet time!
XD
Just go to nfl.com
otakon: way to annunciate wrong
He might be in the little wrek's room
shame you only got the one game on steam TOY_PON3... if only you had more than TF2
emangamer: he did it earlier to SuperBrony64|AFK while he was playing
Little Mod's Room?
I just don't want no allcaps
05this level is bullshit
>.> Im broke and plus I want more games WHEN I have the money
lol
oh RAWRity hows Mod3rator going :3
13you said that about all the Plutonia levels wrek :P
TOY_PON3: I feel ya
13especially that one where you saved with 1hp and then exited the level
hey otakon got a steam account?
yeah
it's otakon17
Dat spambot
well, when you get L4D2 then we can play TOY_PON3... im not a big player of TF2 much
machine gun death!
XD
ugh RAWRity PLEASE dont use "Mod3rator" as the title...using numbers as letters is THE DUMBEST thing you can do
lolno
emangamer: that's the joke.
but I don't have TF2
RAWRity: but it's not a joke. its just dumb
I was planning on that Midnight_Tempest and okay otakon
emangamer RAWRity loved my title idea... Moder4tor: The Assimilation
plus
my bandwidth is garbage
Scr4m
Dken2021: Scre4m
inb4 MW4
2mbps tops
F3AR
you all forgot about that one
Mod-three-arator...I dont get it...whats so cool about it
we believe in you Wrek, believe in us who believe in you!
Modern W4rf4re
Left4Dead...oh wai
*wait
otakon: f-three-er
R4WRity
05,15MW3...because you will buy a game you already own if it has a new number on it
ar
Wrek gots this! :)
fluttercry: it's becoming the new Madden
or another Madden
You sure will when 30 million others do.
V10l3nt SH1T 2
fluttercry: to be fair, that's how most sequels are.
alrighty
And you spend a buttload of money on extras.
In two years, CoD will be a MMO.
lol
05,15this is true. but especially in the case of the CoD series. There is such a little difference between them.
^
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^6
dat 6
>_< curse IT!
I wonder if they'll still use Madden when he kicks the bucket?
essentially, after the first Modern Warfare, they've just been the same game over and over.
inb4 a cod fan tells you there's a difference
essentially, minus the campaign
Well, blame people that buy it and blame Activision for their business practices.
otakon: then they'll make a "Memorial" edition that has a mod where you can make all your players into Madden.
someone HONESTALLY tried to tell me there was a difference between BF3 and MW3
the name
lol RAWRity
there isnt though
GOD DAMMIT Midnight_Tempest I JUST LOST THE GAME
yeah i gave up on both titles already
XD
05,15Well there is between those. BF3 is slower and not as explosive
/me lost the game...FUCK
someone should make a mod of that now
/me pats emangamer's back
I have BF3, but will probably sell it. I never had fun with BF3.
emangamer: now, to be fair, the Multiplayer in BF3 is more complex than MW3's "Everybody is John Rambo" approach to battles.
I have MW3
But I haven't played a fun MP shooter in a long time.
:P
RAWRity: but it's the same game
dat Fleur
BF3 usually requires some strategy or team work.
/me tries to squint his eyes to see the stream
did I see... the BFG?
i want a mod for L4D and L4D2 that makes the players into ponies... that would be awesome
i hate when no one works as a team in multiplayer ._.
08,14BF3 ist staretgey
emangamer: eh, as far as mechanics and campaign? yeah. But the balancing of enemies, skills required, and general atmosphere of BF3 is superior to MW3.
thats pretty funny DerpyHooves`
/me wonders if Halo is still relevent
I less like the publishers behind the games than the games themselves.
i would play a MP game if i had headphones and playing with people from bronystate
^
Dken2021: nah not really
05,15it does though. If you try to just rush in, you get destroyed
but it looks interesting
Well, I have L4D and L4D2
Dken2021: it will be once Halo 4 comes out.
ugh noobs...
Just buy Section 8 Prejudice, me and Wrek play it once in a while
Mrow? We talking about Medal of Modern Battlefield again? o.O
RAWRity: not really...cuz it will suck
05,15Also jets are the most fun thing ever
I would also like to play with other friends and not randoms.
emangamer: but it will be relevant.
dat cyberdemon
how did Wrek get 192% life?
he's giving it 192%
05,15mega sphere?
^
Ohai Ghosties...
eman: He ate some spanich.
c'mon Wrek you can do this!
and if anything, Halo is at least more colorful than the COD series.
I don't want to get into BF3. Probably like the other titles: Unforgivingly-steep difficulty curve.
oh in da face
hwo did he die in one hit?
05cause that CYBERDEMON one shots
Nittany_Discord: only for the vehicles
Nittany_Discord: kinda. BF3 requires some strategy, so your teammates play a big part in how well you're able to perform.
cyberdemon dead now?
I sucked in BC2.
Seems that way.
05,15but most of the time everyone but you will sit in the back and snipe
But I was a loner.
It's designed so that you can't just go out and kill people on your own.
but not anymore right Nittany_Discord_?
argh
I stopped playing BC2.
You have to actually communicate with your team mates. Which makes it easy to see when a COD player is trying out BF.
^
I wasn't having fun.
wait...why is there Nittany_Discord and Nittany_Discord_?
emangamer: connection issues
Because I'm on mIRC.
whats the point of an MP game that you dont work with your teammates to survive? L4D and L4D2 are best examples of teamwork
eeyup
I'm trying to get a color script running on either.
well maybe it was for the best idk
Midnight_Tempest: for people who want to be John Rambo/a bullet bag.
Alright im going to watch some football. If im not back in two hours than goodnight.
I would play BF with friends more than randoms.
I hated the fact that CoD MP was always free for all regardless of mode
05,15This is usually what my teams end up like http://ragecomics.memebase.com/2012/01/09/rage-comics-stand-together/?fb_ref=newpromocopy
RAWRity: thoes are the Halo players that rage quit when they move out of cover
CoD MP has killstreaks. That makes it unbalanced and unfair to new players and unskilled players.
Good evening gentleman~
hey bronyriffic
It pretty much shuts out anyone with little patience.
Nyria<3

Oh~! Midnight_Tempest <3
DOOM!
Hi Nyria! yfw I'm a lady xD

Woah, and I see that when I was gone some people had done got themselves a fancy new %

A derpy mod? :o
oops, sorry Dermathil tab fail

That is Vi silly
Lord_of_Beards: I don't even...

/me hugs Silverscreen
I don't know what happened anymore
Dermathil: it's me, otakon!
OIH

good lord
08,14we hve miseed yu ;A;
Lord_of_Beards: Oh it is?~
I didn't understand the purple thingy
When was this Lord_of_Beards
tis a lie!
yes, I am the Lord of ALL Beards and the Regent of Moustaches as well
If my schedule isn't too demanding, I may come back.
Lord_of_Beards is a lord not a otakon
but the latter is a lesser title
Lord_of_Beards: Well... are you racist?~
Yay I'm happy to hear this SS!
:3
no
really very happy!
thats good SS
:D
unless your siderburns
And I may ressurrect some old memes. :D
they are NOT proper facial hair
I'm not sure...
Silverscreen: like what?
05,15Where was gondor when Silverscreen returned
BMN memes?
Silverscreen, have you got a flute to play?
gondor was sitting around with its head up its ass
(really old meme dating back to a hooful of bits)
otakon: y so beard obsessed?
i like that idea Dken2021
/me giggles
Flutes, barrels and Gondor, ohmai.
Rawrity: his beard is the most regal of them all
This visitation of Silverscreen was brought to you by the Man With No Name. :|
cant forget leverage
Fleur: since when is Gondor in Washington DC?
LOL
Man these meme's open up massive to usage...
ha ^
Fleur: no all caps
RAWRITY: Where was Washington when the SOPA Bill threatened the internet?
hahah rawrity
We can't forget ...
Silverscreen: it was with SOPA, arguing over it.
/me simply walks into Gondor <_< >_>
ORAORAORAOROAROARO
XD
Silverscreen washington was sitting on its ass

05,15Well anyone can walk into Gondor.
Oh okay TOY_PON3~
well damn
/me hasn't seen any new episodes since Sisterhooves Social. x.x
Send him my wub
do not take this out of context: http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ly5rh8A6dz1r19504o1_500.png
then you're in for a doozy
08,14Silverscreen: do it nowwwwwww
Dat face.
Silverscreen watch yesterday's episode asap.
Hence why fluttershy is my favorite
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjWqTLWYERc&feature=related
Wait a second...
Yeah, I heard Derpy gets a bigger role and all that.
Yaaaay~
The episode was more awesome than Lesson Zero and Luna Eclipsed
I'm forgeting a meme~
something like that, yes
/me tries to walk into Mordor and is merciless slaughtered 'Nooooooo!!' x_x
05,15Let's face it, Nyria will never figure it out
Dermathil: granted that's not hard for Luna Eclipsed...
Derpy has quite a role indeed.
Well Luna was great in LE
I would love to see more Luna.
fluttercry: Yeah... We will never figure it out~
hey... where is that shoe king?
King of shoes, Aquire all the leverage~!
08,14roll?
08,14roll???
13roll?
08,14buble warp
rock
08,14<3
I don't get why people claim Season 2 isn't as good as Season One. It hink they're all just suffering from Nostalgia Goggles. Season two, at worst, is on par with S1 in terms of good/bad/okay episodes, IMO
Picklebarrel~
/me 13thinks vivi must be terribly sleepy right niw~
ALL the bubble wrap
Silverscreen, I prefer S2 to S1 personally.
cherrichanga: http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/ca47a765-054b-4ff0-bc06-046a7569f2f2.jpg
Season 2 has been awesome.
ChimmiCherry Cherrichanga!
Wrek: close some tabs man!
Mare-do-well has been the only meh episode.
/me wubs all the ponies
season 2 is awesomes!!
same Nittany_Discord
I actually liked Mare-do-Well.
/me wubs Nyria back <3
Picklebarrel, Picklebarrel, Kumquat, CHERRYCHANGA!
seems like Wrek had a crash
<3
wait, you're a h-op now?
Silverscreen: didn't you say you hadn't seen anything past Sisterhooves?
It did kinda rehash the Trixie episode theme, but it was done differently and rather well.
SS: Oh my gosh, someone else who liked it?!?
0,5And it flew real low
RAWRity: Yes.
hi Lord_of_Beards
oops
Silverscreen: so you lied?
0,5o:
saying hi to myself
Smooth Lord_of_Beards ~
I did?
0,5Silverscreen?
how silly
Good evening to you, LordCelestia
Silverscreen: Sisterhooves was e5. Mare-do-well is e8
LordCelestia?
Oh, so I did.
0,5Hi there!
talking to yourself, first sign of mental problems... or just lonely
/me blehs.
Uh oh.
/me is lonely
/me talks to himself all the time.
*FOREVER ALONE*
0,5Lord of beards must be otakon
Talkin to yourself is fine. Its when you answer yourself that you have a problem
/me is the only one that understands me
Hello thar bronystate! I have returned!
:D
lali-ho IngloriousPony89
/me noms on LordCelestia
LordCelestia: what makes you come to that inglorious conclusion?
0,5<_<
who is this "otakon"?
/me talks to himself as well
Lord_of_Beards: Wait... What's my name?~
13otakon?
Fleur: Naw, answering yourself is okay. I told myself so.
/me noms the bacon mane
/me 0,5brushes LadyCanary with a toothbrush
/me Smiles *squee*
I am master of ALL facial hair
Lord_of_Beards: What is my actual name?~
/me looks at the episodes list
...What in the toothbrush?
you?
o3o
You're never alone Silverscreen when you got loyal friends around like I am!!!
I have no idea
evevn the fu-machus?
Dken2021: they are in my power as well.
AH! "Secret of My Excess" was the last one I watched, the one with Spike "growing up"
0,5Rewally?
lol
Lord_of_Beards: You are not otakon~!
0,5That was a while ago
then can you bring back the toothbrush?
Silverscreen: ah, so you've got 4 eps to cath up on.
Get a'watchin
Why do you ~ at the end of every sentece? Are you a dandy?
no
That means no facial hair!
he is in wub
I think ponies can wait, this is the first I've seen of Silverscreen ~
Lord_of_Beards: yes~
You are beneath me sir!
Be gone with you!
Hearth's Warming Eve, Family Appreciation Day, baby Cakes, and The Last Round Up.
okay.jpg
Yep, including what I can only sum up as "The Diabeetus episode." (Baby Cakes)
sato ftw.
I have Molestia on speed dial..
Your nakedness of the face appals me!
don't make me.
Mind calling her up for me Dashie? :D
Baby Cakes is indeed the cause of half the world's cases of diabetus.
So how are you feeling today Silverscreen? I'm hyper happy to see you around once more!
Silverscreen: Have you seen the newest as of yesterday?
he hasn't otakon
Dashie_Dashie, knowing some of the people in FiM fandom, I think they might like that.
Silverscreen: Good one to have stopped on, though. It's a solid ep
Lord_of_Beards: No.
.__.
0,5Oh boy, yesterdays episode was amazing. If he hasnt seen it dont spopil it
0,5*spoil
Silverscreen: you should catch up when you can
^
Saw it yesterday.
Yeah
yeah the episode is a nospoil.
No spoilers
/me dashie is pleased
FYI you will shit bricks
I know about Derpy, at the very least.
0,5Well he knows that obviously :P
I! SPOIL! Never!
Derpy? What derpy?
Dashie_Dashie I havent had a chance to speak to the princess in some time. I need to get in touch with her more often.
imo, it was a little meh
I heard she actually talks too.
Silverscreen, it wasn't even what made the episode so great in my eyes. Go see it anyway!!!
Im back :)
oh ok
i want to hose down Lord_of_Beards with Nair... that would be funny :)
her number is 777-TO-THEMOON
^
I mean besides that one scene, episode in whole didn't have that much
wb
Nooooooo
Midnight_Tempest: impossible! As LORD of all facial hair, my beard is immutable by ALL outside forces save my own hand, you fool.
I disagree
thank you Dashie_Dashie <3
Your welcome. <3
let's just say that it's official: Tabitha St. Germaine is best VA.
Thanks haha
Lord_of_beards, I assume your beard is immutable to razor blades since only your fingers can cut them?
555-LUNASUX is celestia's office number

Oh, so we get another song?
I see then Lord_of_Beards... I shall enlist the help of your evil counterpart from another dimension then, by using Pinkie Pie to get him and arm him with razors and shaving cream!
Rev: You can do better than that.
/me hasn't even been on Ponychan, so knows nothing of any of the four episodes he's missed.
no he cannot
we get a few other songs inbetween the episode you last saw and today
05suddenly rev goes wild
Uh oh!
Rev was always wild~
Sigmar: go watch them now. You must, you must, YOU MUST.
dat wild
:O
Rev, I COMMAND you to not display such atrocities from now on.
er, Silverscreen even
That seems a tad extreme
o3o meep....
As MASTER of all facial hair.
/me is back

/me welcomes emangamer back
I'll watch them later. :P *procrastination*

Why would anyone TRY to get banned.
05hmm
rev got his ass banned
/me beard grows back instantly, twice of thick and lustrous!
I think he wants to make sure he doesn't accidentally stumble in here or something
05cant remember rev acting liek that before
ever
LadyCanary: because they need attention.
Fleur: He did?~ I'm not suprised~
REV IS B&
Either that or they're reaaaallly stupid.
^
LadyCanary: that usually goes hand and hand
I believe he is stupid
/me nods
not 1/10th of the intelligence of my facial folicles!
did not clicking links finally work?
05,15Well time to delete the history
though really, in terms of nasty images, that's really not that scarring.
Tis not.
Also, can't stop listening to Tombstone's remix of Ponybeat's Discord.
Now that's just mean! Rev is not stupid
RAWRity: it isnt the thing you want to click on in the presence of your parents though
I'm quite fond of Rev.
I mean, if you're gonna troll, make is something really nasty that people will remember. That image barely elicites a reaction.
08,14I am fond of Rev
08,14but reuls ar reuls
emangamer: yes, but that's half the internet.
RAWRity: only half?
emangamer: the other half is ponies
I'm kind of netural on rev myself, but the last 2 days... he scared me~
I like turtles.
I've never seen Rev online before though
I havent seen too much of rev lately besides yesterday.
Nyria: that's the most peppy fear I've ever seen.
and now you'll never see him again

Peachy: or rather, because their need to try and break said rule.

/me examines Silverscreen beard carefully
Silverscreen: you are correct.
Midnight_Tempest: nonsense
Silverscreen who doesn't?
/me wonders if silverscreen has resigned himself to a vow of /me
did my clone come back from the moon and wreak havok on you guys?
/me pulls out the Nair bombs effortlessly using his BEARDED FU!
indeed he did tvoie
whois RAWRity
/me is not resigned. Just likes the use of this function.

08,14Ruby_Pinch. . .?
emangamer: NO! you must be duller than the Razors of Obselenense!
besides, it's helped me build my skills as a writer. A lot of stuff I didn't really think about or examine when it comes to writing and story construction beforehand now comes almost second nature to me.
for a number of years now work has been proceding in order to bring perfection to the crudely concived idea of a transmission that would not only provide inverse reactive current with unilateral phase detractors...
that's moonspeak
DerpyHooves`: BAD PONY!
them text walls
my fellow bronies, i must go on an adventure tomorrow, i have just discovered that my local walmart has some of the mlp blind bags in stock
/me hugs Asmalya ~
i only hope that they still have some of the mane 6, preferably pinkie pie
Ingwaz: :o
Nonsense, just walls as thick as my beard, but less so.

oops i accidentally the whole channel
LordCelestia just set +b on someone
What nonsense, damnedable machine how DARE you defy me!

who is screwball?
How's screwball?~

Hey Leo ~
hey, leo!
wow....dat sandvich
Screwball is a fun little joke. I don't see her as a replacement for derpy, just a fun little design to mess with.

Hello Leo, behold my beard and rejoice!
Screwball is a pony that floated by the screen for a few seconds in ep 2 os season 2

Well, the Parasprite cot kicked, I can deal.
wow...

/me is unimpressed by your porn.
^
ok.. welp.. imma be off now. you guys get a bad rep in #brony and i wanted to see for myself how it really was. i admire the rules you've set upon yourselves and and your steadfast beliefs. i apologize on behalf of my fellow #brony brethren, their prioties are different than yours
bronystate has become so big that it has formed the shape of. a. target.
RAWRity: of what I have seen, that was fairly bad
Yeah, don't really care enough to click the link anyways
whats this video called?
question!
....
Lord_of_Beards: then you clearly have nto spent enought time on the internet.
PACKAGE PWN!
Leo: do you think we care about those idiots?
I have Cupcakes.
again.. sorry
scout is that ?
A very heavy letter
13now now folks, be kind
Scout gets porn. XD
lol!
....
Appropriate
Rainbo frosted cupcakes /)^3^(\
What on earth xD
but Shizuka....did you see what they posted?
LOL
lololololol Peachy
13i did
13and they are gone now
they deserve it
Also holy shit MFW Silverscreen.
Leo: some people are bad, some people are good, get that everywhere, we just kick the bad ones out usually
Hi.
Scout likes moving fast. RD likes moving fast. they are prefect for each other.
Good to see you bro, but I need to get back to bed.
why do all chanops and half-ops talk in colors?
i don't really see good or bad, just different
oh wait
oh yeah, wasn't Lyra trying to get somebody to troll us in #brony last night?
Dash + santa hat = d'aww
G'night, Dari.
Would you guys hate me If I told you I was eating rainbow frosted cupcakes?
ok... so how do i got onto bronystate though mIRC... i seem to have become computer illiterate suddenly
thats easy zeppony, so their text is easy to see
they have to be seen sometimes to let people know to stop stuff
PhrozenFire: no why would we? (DONT YOU /DARE/)
I wouldn't hate Pgrozen but I'd be jelly
No, because cupcakes are sweet and tasty.
WHAT in the blazes is #brony?
...isn't that Banjo Kazooi music?
Phrozen*
Lord_of_Beards: PLEASE dont ask
yes, banjo kazooie music
That place is a den of inequitity for sure!
but doesn't the webchat client show who has chanop status? my client does
it seems to be an unmoderated channel Lord_of_Beards
Banjo and kazooie music?
dat Banjo Kazzoie music
Gah! Lag!
And I can only scoff at people that need to be gross, because they're embarassed to watch a kid's show.
can someone tell me where I can find some bronies near my area?
i hope there will be a day when the two aren't seemingly at eachothers throats
Ingwaz: I believe you are correct, HOW can it be?
Did someone ping me before? My connection derped on me.
how can what be?
#brony is ponychat's premier channel
08,14>listen to 8-bit becoming popular
not unmoderated, just less strict
PhrozenFire, you can always check facebook is you have one
LESS strict?
Well
I found all my brony friends on facebook
yeh. basically anything goes except hate.
We are not that strict to begin with
zeppony: considering i've seen people use the N word and no one raised an objection, thats probably unmoderated
oh lawd MOLESTIA
....
/me pauses the stream because lag is not fun.
no, it's not unmoderated
there's a dickhead named Sebas who goes around being a dick to everybody
Molestia as the hunter? Nice.
he's gotten kickbanned a few times
who streaming?
Wrek is
wrek
Molestia vs. Vagineer vs. Painis Cupcake.
making people feel worthless and stuff
uhoh....molestia
#brony has is nearly without limit to what you can do.. a place like this can seem restrictive
DerpyHooves`: do you lave a link? I can't find it
Anyway, yeah, they're a different crowd. No point talking to them.
I'd rather stay here and talk cartoons.
Saw?
alright, Got the names I needed from brony.
rule 34 links get posted all the time, but that's because when you watch a show for little girls there's really not much you can say about what people can and can't like
indeed Leo, the rules here can be a little strict in some cases, but for the most part, so long as you're not a jerk you're fine
they just gave me the material I needed.
Giant ponies!
mhm
Flutterbitch! :D
i just always feel like i'm being judged here. that doesn't happen in #brony
05,15RAWRity what are you going to do with those names?
Nooo Ads, i hate ads
Different strokes for different folks :)
Leo: There is differnce between restritive and uncivil, but I respect your opinions~
fluttercry: you'll see~~~~~~~~~~~~~
...
buy everypony, brony, pegasis, and other people.
oh gawd.. ads are awful
Sexy, Sassy fluttershy?
Bye
RAWRity: what do you mean "got the names i needed from brony"
Cya Silverscreen
what names? why did you need them?
bye.
zeppony: you'll see~~~~~~~~~~
confusion over 900
dat twilight
well zepp, like i said, the rules here arent so bad so long as you're not posting pron or something
you're not turning into MeepSheep are you?
Ingwaz: some people express themselves in pronz
zeppony: don't know who that is.
I see no problem with the rules here. They are in no way unreasonable
^
^^
douchebag from dongforc.es IRC that had his dongforce buddies come and spam #brony
Nyria, i know about that, but often times the intent behind the words aren't seemingly the ones you would expect
what a cock face
well, that may be, but you don't need to make something like that opennly shown to people who may find it offensive
bai everypony
See ya, IshBestPony
Dat Molestia
Goodbai IshBestPony
Bai IshBestPony
Can I say nigger?
for the most part the rules here are fairly reasonable, perhaps a little strict at times, but reasonable
laters IshBestPony
no
no TopHat
oh nononono. I jsut have it for creative purposes.
thats likely to get you kicked/banned
too late
bye~ IshBestPony
perhaps a link tagging rule might be better
like [NSFW] and [SPOILER]
That isn't my call :-/
holy jesus
i disagree on the nsfw part, i'd say keep that out
ta ta IshBestPony ~
So, Ponies are pretty cool.
Dat Trixie~
Ingwaz: but wrek is in this room
No NSFW is not a hard rule to follow.
ya?
/me hugs Randomnerd and IngloriousPony89 and Lady_Canary and Dken2021 and TheGreatAndPowerfulT and Nyria and Fleur
13rule 34 is not allowed in bronystate and related channels, it's not hard
mfw I read that is "Not Save From Wrek"
/me hugs back.
/me hugs IshBestPony back
This is silly
lol emangamer
ponies are more than just cool Randomnerd, theyre at least 20% cooler, so, theyre pretty awesome
What we should do is, keep the rules like it is and stay PG13
can we stop talking about the /bad/ channels please?
omg.
/me facehoofs at emangamer
tis
Painis.
Shizuka: that channel, is like the evil negative counterpart to here it seems...
/me hugs back
/me noms TopHat's hat
#brony isn't a bad channel. a lot of the network admins hang out there
All we need now is Creepy Scout.
The secret to my safety from wrek is I'm so ugly, no one wants to imagine me naked :D
Pain is in dat anus
It shouldnt even be an argument tbh

Bye TheGreat and Powerful
NullRadix that's cool. keep up the good work
my scene is currently 1024 polygons (nice round number!)... I'm wondering if that's too much detail for game use
Not really.
Hey MakerDusk! You in here?
/me floats around once more
I feel blue
I know blender takes about 1.5 seconds to render each frame when It's building the animation...
I'd say 2000 poly might be the limit. Of course, depends on the comp
dat daribot
but it can also run the animation at full speed in the normal 3D view
So what is the model gonna be for?
oh god that second comic... so much wat
05im hearing hard techno...
05but i dont know from where
.. I'm hearing nothing
what are you taking Wrek?
i'm SEEING nothing - stream is down for me
05a meth based compound
all i hear is the noise of wind
ok I should tackle that spyro stuff now
aaaand Done.
:3
do you want to see any pics of it?
I'll post it tomorrow.
Good night everyone, have to finish some coding and all.

Scoot-Scootaloo: you should as well.
umm dunno what youd want to see
0,14...my tail!
so, anyone taking over the stream?
0,14I can't shake him! XD
/me giggles
I have some spyro posters but they are packed up so cant show those
I better be played by Enrique Iglesias, RAWRity...
So emangamer has killed me and so has IshBestPony...now what?
/me 11,14 is the mod lurking under your bed :3
I have spyro toys..
/me grabs kirzstryfe and tosses him off of SaxyPretender's tail
/me steels himself

/me stabs TOY_PON3|Ghost with a healing shiv

/me 's defense rises by 100%
Sure...you didnt really say what you had...there was too much to say lol
yay :3
/me debates asking to use LordCelestia's moon cannon
when you have a healing shiv... violence is always the answer
I have about every ported game for the legend of spyro series
Guys, you know whats a funny word?
think I'm just missing the xbox version
what?
The word "Plot"
What :o
dat PLOT
:O
Plot plot plot
oh yeah, dawn of the dragon is also what I'm missing for ps3 and 360
/me facehoofs
So much PLOT
Im in it for the bucking PLOT
:)
Its only for letters and yet it causes a lot of sensation!
Really thats a lot of Legend games
There are many different meanings too!
Lie owning a plot of land or the plot of a movie!
1inda amazing how much a word's meaning can change in only a years time
so on a completely different note, where's the link to sign up for the newsletter? I can't find it anywhere on the website

Phase4: haven't posted it yet. Saving it til tomorrow.

Scoot-Scootaloo: joo vil cee~

Okay

Quadrenaro: why did you do that, and where?
hi otakon

at 12000+replies
good god
the battlefield 3 fourum
/me is so hungry he dies from starvation
anyway how i started it,
we had a hater spaming us
/me is now hiding under the covers so as to not wake anyone up.
and i decided to go undercover
<_<
and try to convert him
HI SaxyPretender !!!!
Haters gonna hate.
into the herd
404 pages yikes
SaxyPretender: that was INCREDIBLE timing
0,14>.>
so
/me sneaks under SaxyPretender's bed
Pretty cool...some of the stuff you dont usually even see
0,14...Oh man...
i changed my gamertag and became a hater for a day
someone resurrect me please i dont want to go back to being a ghost >.>
I have a pony profile on GameFront. Don't really care who does what.
Dammit kirzstryfe dont make me get the vaccum cleaner under there!
unfortunatly my friends list is huge
the spyro soundtrack and the half poster are the rare ones in the picture
and half are haters
they saw my post, and figured it was open season
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEMD28MMtNg
Have answered to misconceptions though.
any way in one day we got over a 1000 replies of hat
hate*
Yeah...I dont think I have ever seen a poster and never known they had a soundtrack
Some guy posted a thread on bronies. Had half of the "facts" wrong.
and 3000 posts of support?
though to be honest we havent had many haters bother us latley
I didnt either
oh hey, the Giants won.
http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/forum/threadview/2832654624772278002/ << link to what Quadrenaro is talking about
yep
0,14There's one hater in my Fighting Game Club
posters are very rare to come by, expect to pay a lot if you want to buy it
And cited G1 as what bronies watch.
as for the soundtrack..
last page on that topic - 404
0,14I put up something about Fighting is Magic being considered for EVO
I probably wouldnt sell it for less than $100
a post on page 404 "I can't hear you over the sound of DERPY'S CANON STATUS!"
lol
"The mods have slippery ban hammers."
Yeah...havnt even seen one yet and the soundtrack they are pry rare and non existant
So, post ponies, get banned from playing EA games.
0,14and he was complaining about how "fighting is getting wimpied [not the exact word he used]"
but I dont plan to, its one of the few things ive got thats uncommon
...Wooooooow.
im a hater trying to become a brony but now everyone is just being lazy : P
and not trying to convert
"no ponies are gay" << this meens so little its funny
lol
Yeah I hear you...I wouldnt want to either lol how much did you pay for it?
my only regret is i couldnt really fight in the war
i was egging the haters on
ugh forget it
i got a bunch of friend requesrs
i choose to interpret that as (no ponies) are (gae, 'objectionable'), wich makes it praise for ponies
/me turns back to life
hmm...
it was less than $10
ohai TOY_PON3
I bought it online, the seller didnt know what he had

SaxyPretender: what's your favorite trilogy?

0,14later TOY_PON3
00,10oh hell we let kirzstryfe in too.
SuperBrony64: I had put Nittany in Mod 3 as a cameo, but he didn't fit the role once he became a mod.
XD
derpy_pony it's a big problem everywere unless you're very rich or poor health care can cost alot
11,14^_^
/me brings his poisons into the nomming and takes kirzstryfe out with him
/me is not nommed, his defense is too high

Oh my goodness Shizuka. Best morning ever.

the spyro stuff is probably taking the least amount of space compared to the rest of the stuff I have
and then dari came
CriticKitten: eeyup

Then they win/
Toleration overruled
All the money.
I was thinking FRIENDSHIP....FRIENDSHIP>>>>>
10,02Nice drawing Shizuka!
Most of the game related stuff I have is in its original packaging
10,02Great work! :>
00,10I used to wonder what extermenate could be
did the metal thing fall?
so it takes up way more space than normal
13es ist not my drawing .-.

I wonder if they still make Bufferin?
00,10it was tracking a minimized window
derpy_pony: how so?
Q.Q Wheely scaares me.
Ive named it loading_wheel.exe
she should be more than the comic relief
but we HAVE seen her serious before
8,1Phase4: i'm keeping them warm for her!
...
OH GOD
Dont break dat pinky promise
god I'm addicted to these vidoes
Oh
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJP11_BkU8Q

Ok.
and being a silly pony is what she has always been
/me 8,1flies shy's colours
Oh see the part that lights up on the turntable
inb4 shykicked
ohh ok
yes, we have seen character depth in her, but not very often...
8,1she said it was cool.
lol
derpy_pony: because she doesn't get episodes that often.
mfw she said it was cool

11,14they put him in a straight jacked, but let him keep his mask on
Ive seen those turntables sell for $70+
pinkydash: I didn't.

The mask makes him look...cool kirzstryfe.
kirzstryfe: yeah, I noticed that too, maybe its out of respect...
almost everypony
11,14*jacket
implying Batman couldn't figure a way out of a Straight Jacket.
*cough*
yeah, this ep
00,10I watched the ep in 420p I had left the CC option on from earlyer
autio (n) - i dont even
never seen them on ponychan, RAWRity ... everyone want scoot and aj and rd and whatnot
I want to point out that I am not rich by any means
Really wow you do find this stuff cheap
but pinkie...can't remember even one
RAWRity: he can, but he wasn't trying to hurt them
I just buy it if its real cheap
I know haha you said you were just as cheap as me :p
yup
Seriously though, they have black and white tv
although..
derpy_pony: plenty of people were asking for it on here. as well as for FLuttershy.
Batman could figure his way out of a straight jacket with no hands
I wish it would be the same with car related stuff :P
but cybernetics and minicameras!
8,1dat awesome music

Ah, whjat a wonderful world where even the disabled can become improbably criminals.
Haha I know what you mean!
hm...
and then he took a batman to the reality
I want to turn my car into a gt
Kencolt: I think it's just a gauntlet
but that wont be cheap
yeah....also the men dressed like a bat...
enope, nvm

That ain't no guantlet unless his forearm is six inches long naturally.

Kencolt: yeah, I just noticed that
The dumb guys at the repar shop locked my key up so I had to go allll the way home get the spare and go allll the way back...they are getting an angry customer tomorrow
00,10joker is now alfrid
Alfred is best butler.
A GT lol that would be cool
I don't get it, they don't have the net and no color tv's
Congratulations Alfred, you're the new Joker

But they got cybernetics, mutagenic compounds and mini wireless camera's
scarecrow?
eeyup
00,10his blood what?
My whole childhood, as well as alot of money
That makes it certain-- if he had a hand they would have taken it away first off.
Kencolt: eeyup
Dr. Batman.
they did that? wow..
that's why he didn't do it
00,10bat yoink
can you watch youtube videos?
Batman PhD in WTF
since they have his blood wont they know now who he is?
bluestrom_S: no dna testing
..what the FUCK kind of injection forces you to sleep for 2 days?
but they got CYBERNETICS!
0,14...wait, this story...
Robin. Of course!
your reflexes, batman
SaxyPretender: yes, it IS Batman Begins
Yeah
00,10there goes his insurance
And yes I can
0,14no, no
SaxyPretender: what?
It's a trap!
totalled XD
0,14I think this is a direct adaption of a Silver Age story
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX21HyZGpp8
Batrave
ah
ive got the exact same car
not yet
if I could turn it in a GT I could try that lol
00,10that man......he has no eyes
Pretty cruse cybernetis-- more like a control system similar to an amputee's claw.
SaxyPretender: nah. if it was, there'd be more Aliens.
0,14that forms a HUUUUGE basis of Grant morrison's first act of his Batman Mega-arc
guy in a bat suit probably should be in an asylum
especcialy if he is unconscous
just saying
+i
batatonic state
because no one ever sees the bat actualy saving people
eeyup
must be a delusion
+o : D
/me lobs a brick at Tovler
yeah, like you can beat the bat
0,14...but yeah, RAWRity, this seems like Batman Begins XD
dat plot
Lol that would be awesome
its a 4 cylinder btw
pre information age heroes
this is the other way around
Yeah I kinda guessed
um..he DIDN'T come to arkham.
which is awesome, the gas milage would still be good
nope
as if someone could escape arkham
just crashed on the way to where he was going
and THATS why he doesn't believe him
Yeag...I get like 19 MPG
forever
yeah but its an SUV
where does he get the money for this stuff?
theft
Arkham Security has more holes than a wheel of swiss cheese.
lower personnel knows about the prisoners...bad organization
dat face reveal
yeah, and The Scarecrow got a new look in this episode too
how do they get out of arkham, is that ever explained?
suddenly no straight jacket
much more scary looking since his first appearance
00,10they used the plot exit
Phase4: easy, Arkham sucks shit.
Yep...after I get some of the work done should be better...the EGR valve which is bad will help it a bit
I want this drug
they used Pinkie.java
so your suv is still at the shop?
yeah, The Scarecrows gas is a REALLLY powerful hallucigenic
kaboo--- oh
but for a really freaky Batman story, read "Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth"
i'm going to assume this is a video game and they have console access
yeah
00,10mindfuck much
dat gun
it's a giant bleeding gun
BFG much?
0,14Batman's tripping balls, it seems
the have full plot access...without the pony interpretation
eeyup
No I brought it home...they said to bring it to the dealer
10,02Ohai :3
so they didnt do anything?
you think this is a mindfuck? read that story I suggested. It's Grant Morrison at his crackiest.
dat supple
Nope they said the computer is bad they think...they drove it
*supply
00,10giant river runs under prison gg
supple lolz
arkham severs are everywhere
yeah
sewers?
how can the computer be bad if its drivable?
too drunk to look it up now
God, I love Arkham Asylum that game is great
Thats exactly what I said but everyone even in my family says its possible
>Is told Villain is going to destory the city
>Drugs and imprisons superhero
This is the worst Doctor ever.
i'm not convinced he's a scientist
just shoot him
ballet kick
I would think it would be misfiring everywhere and it wouldnt know what to do and certainly not hold or know codes
even batman isn't immune to a bullet in the head
its misfiring when you drive?
batman can escape arkham
controled madness thats like organised chaos
god
.....an axe?
oh
No...it says it is but it doesnt feel like it. It does shake and rattle a bit but you know its olf
old*
I'm talking about this shitty doctor assigned to batman.
idiots let him keep his utility belt
it rattles bad?
0,14Scarecrow is best Sinestro Corps member
No not bad just a bit
they have like 3 types of security people in this show...and they all look the same
"He might go insane without it!"
lol
woah
SaxyPretender: damn straight.
moar mindfuckery
if it really is the computer....
dat face
Acccccciiiiiiiiddddddd tttttrrrrrrriiiiiiiipppppp
thats a very bad sign
yeah, this part creeped me the hell out as a kid
even though Blackest Night as a whole was pretty underwhelming, that part was pretty awesome.
so very much

previously... Zuko was less of a dick
09,01Tovler: friend told me it's a lot like the old games. More cramped, less ammo, more emphasis on survival
7,2Publishers like Capcom and EA deserves to be paid in sacks of crap.
oh, this is...The Painted Lady.
