Nah multiplayer MOH can't be windowed
its idiotic
There's some program to force windowed on fullscreen games
there might be when actually playing though
0,5With Shy leaving the team, who's going to take over the Regulars room?
And there it goes~
I think I don't much like mips.tv
how many Harddrives do you need man?
Why? Stream service shouldn't make a difference?
10,02Well, using Procaster might make a difference
Ahh
Can do
0,5Uuuuuse the procastah
10,02Lemme first see if I can change settings though

05nope
$10 on GOG
05# is the best one
053*
05gameplay wise
Oh?
05yes
Now I'm interested. I got pretty good at 5, never tried 3
I like 5 best myself, but 3 is definitely a solid title
05imo
05though i kind like how 6 plays out
05i did liek the whole custom hero thing though
Yeah.
That was a good move.
Hmm.. there are some expansion packs for HoMM3 right? are they any good?
05the expansion were neat
05but
I foresee losing
Let them come.
let them be sure
hmm ok
fight well!
05but as for campaign it wasnt that much either
well
HITS is proving a bust
the interface is busted
05i dunno
05havent teached him about that yet
I enter in the correct infor
Okay
05he's still graspign combat and economy
they tell my the info is INCORRECT
argh
See?
That sulfur mine is MINE

05hover the city hall building to see the requirements
All I need is money
05yes

CONSPIRACY!
CONSPIRACY http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tzI1iysdkA
*Shifty eyes* It's not a conspiracy, move along.
05is uggest getting more troops before going further north
How do I build a castle?
05you upgrade the keep
All you have to do is take a ton of Granite, add it to the mix
05the citadel
Ha
05in this case
05make sure you can support the ones you have first
Just looking around
Ill need to wait until next round for the castle
05slowly graspign the concept :D
IKR, all thanks to you ^_^
05once you reach capitol you should have enough income to buy all weekly troops
05and upgrade most buildings
steal the llake
its glittering
go steal it
I did already :P
Hence the blue flag :P
oh
See? Told you. If it glitters, it's usually stealable.
:D
You can get it at GOG.com
=legal? :')
Awesome site where you can download old games legally.
You have to buy them ofc
I know I have Heroes 3 somewhere, but I must have misplaced it
05provide people with the link i gave you if they care to join
05best bet if you want compabillity
Next upgrade is Capitol :D
05and kick some creep arse
IKR
argh
damn it
05nope
05there is an underworld area aswell
05fidn the gate and you find me
Oh cool!
05some maps utilise the whole udnergroudn as anotehr map
For now I mean
That's cool!
05some utilize the undergorund for tunnels of travel
05eeyup
Hai LC
0,5Dat timing...
05well
05you can
05but the inflation is rediculus
05not worth it at all
You can sell resources on the marketplace if you're desperate for coin
Is there really anything I can do besides just wait?
explore things
/me quietly enters room
05hmm
With that army? Probably don't want to...
05id would build more army first
05they can be nasty
I'm waiting for Capitol before I expand my exploration.
Alright.
Elementals are pretty tough units.
:P
Dat dari
0,5Speak of the dari you mean

O u
Same thing.

That sucks
05and if you do that FML wont capture the image of the screencap
can't he just adjust the compatibilty?
Well, I'll fiddle around with it...if I did the screen tracking, it tracks both monitors I have.
05oh well

Rainbow called her Derpy, granted
hey everypony
Cya everypony
no
Whether or not she killed have the fanbase
I'm not debating, I'm just lining up possiblities
but still
it boggles the mind
it also killed off the whole 'derpy is mail-mare'
*walking into the conversation late* yeah, i think the toy department would have a hard time justifying printing "derpy" on a name card
she could still be a mail mare
oh we are streaming an early Heros?
we haven't seen her do that very much recently
cool
Theres a team of whether ponies. RD isnt the only one
is it?
it seemed like it was a local holiday
Derpy was seen as a wheather pony.
06I shall win!
I actuallly made some chimicherrychangas

Dang...wish i had some :P

Once you got the money incoming at a steady rate you don't have to worry about it as much, but in the opening few rounds, you wanna get established.

Hm....
On January 1st, the servers were down.
Shit happens, people call UbiSoft.

It wasn't ironic, PCs are still more expensive than consoles.
They couldn't fix it. Why? Well, their tech support had gone home.
......
Bless you
/me flips coin.

Haha, that's my goal right now.
excuse me
and this is why I don't like the inbrowser client
Okay, since I suck at deciding things, I let the coin flip decide. Gonna root for the necropolis. :D
I would have kept talking to Luna
05troggs are easy
05but get more men
05your army is laughable
because the client doesn't notify of her disconnecting

you went bra shopping with her?
Dang it... I've just got around to opening a bottle of good Apple Cider and I need someone to whom health I can drink to
Clothe shopping
oh
ok, won't haggle you
She might be discreetly giving you the opportunity to figure out how the catches on bras work, sp you dont feel awkward fumbling with them, just in case you ever need to know, for whatever reason.
:) I know.
and brb

/me has it for me~
I cannot truely enjoy the gameplay with that buffering
going*
I actually liked NV, but those loading screens killed me~
I can imagine it would take a looong time :asharus
Skyrim has too many loading screens...or should i say the loading screens are too long
To the brotherhood of steel bunker~! *3 loading screens later*
Wasn't as much as a waste of 60$ as LoTR: Conquest was though
10,02O___o
o___O
*fast.
I wasted my money on RAGE, I don't play gaems that don't have story~ and the main character was meh~
games*
00,10When is the last time you stoped brodcasting?
I believe at most it costs $9,99
I like the easter eggs in RAGE
/me bought rage on the first day~ 60$
I'm thinking of getting Rage. Stil on the fence though :P
06get the copy wir have
thats a ripoff
00,10Mips keeps droping ofline and buffers you might want to find out why
No worries. :P
/me has RAGE on his iPad >.>
I have RAGE.
Well, I picked RAGE up and put it down... never picked it back up again after that~

Depends on the time tomorrow.

10,02Saturn isn't here.
04Oh
07,01Saturn asked for this meeting
07,01but he is mia/afk atm
10,02And 1.) he's heavily involved in the revamp project 2.) he originally wanted the meeting
/me nods
/me waves
07,01that's the problem
00,10Had to look back to stream, I heard good music.

Problem is we don't kow whether Saturn's even free.
Because he's not here.
:P
know*
10,02Which would defeat the purpose if he's not there
07,01we'll give him a heads-up in the revamp group
07,01since he's part of that
07,01i'm leaving now then

051999
I was only 7 back then... huh
/me blushes

:/
09,01no really I think this is impressive
09,01all dat techstuff would boggle my mind
O U
Let me help with that
09,01I wanted to learn Python once
/me clears throat.
09,01I couldn't make heads or tails of even where to start
oh, are we singing?
05best luna shrug
Did you even use a tutorial?
You probably didn't start out with something simple enough.
10,02I learned Java in two intro programming courses my freshman/sohpmore year in college...but then I never touched on it since :/
10,02System.out.println("Hello World!);
05yeh
10,02Opps...forgot to close the quotes
00,10game over already?
>Closing brackets
05im tabbing
00,10oh long turns are long
10,02EARTH DESTRUCTION IN 30 SECONDS
yo

Hmm hmm?
09,01I didn't even get to make a hello world
09,01because I had NO CLUE how to even launch Python...derp
If I don't get it done in 6-7 hours, it'll be post poned till I get home from uni
09,01what might be a good language for starting?
:o Vi lost? ;_;
Whatever you want to learn. :P
Yeah, I know.
I meant she lost the fight, 'cuz the CPU took one of her castles.
ok... i forgot how much fun HoMM3 was... this is great
05depends on if you fight or not
sudden music change

>_< curse IT!
essentially, minus the campaign
someone HONESTALLY tried to tell me there was a difference between BF3 and MW3
the name
there isnt though
yeah i gave up on both titles already
XD
05,15Well there is between those. BF3 is slower and not as explosive
/me lost the game...FUCK
someone should make a mod of that now
/me pats emangamer's back
I have MW3
:P
dat Fleur
BF3 usually requires some strategy or team work.
/me tries to squint his eyes to see the stream
did I see... the BFG?
i want a mod for L4D and L4D2 that makes the players into ponies... that would be awesome
i hate when no one works as a team in multiplayer ._.
08,14BF3 ist staretgey
/me wonders if Halo is still relevent
I less like the publishers behind the games than the games themselves.
^
05,15it does though. If you try to just rush in, you get destroyed
but it looks interesting
Well, I have L4D and L4D2
ugh noobs...
Mrow? We talking about Medal of Modern Battlefield again? o.O
05,15Also jets are the most fun thing ever
I would also like to play with other friends and not randoms.
dat cyberdemon
he's giving it 192%
05,15mega sphere?
^
eman: He ate some spanich.
and if anything, Halo is at least more colorful than the COD series.
I don't want to get into BF3. Probably like the other titles: Unforgivingly-steep difficulty curve.
oh in da face
05cause that CYBERDEMON one shots
I sucked in BC2.
Seems that way.
But I was a loner.
argh
I stopped playing BC2.
^
I wasn't having fun.
Because I'm on mIRC.
I'm trying to get a color script running on either.
well maybe it was for the best idk
I would play BF with friends more than randoms.

douchebag from dongforc.es IRC that had his dongforce buddies come and spam #brony
bai everypony
Can I say nigger?
for the most part the rules here are fairly reasonable, perhaps a little strict at times, but reasonable
no
oh nononono. I jsut have it for creative purposes.
thats likely to get you kicked/banned
like [NSFW] and [SPOILER]
That isn't my call :-/
i disagree on the nsfw part, i'd say keep that out
Dat Trixie~

and 3000 posts of support?
though to be honest we havent had many haters bother us latley
I didnt either
oh hey, the Giants won.

as for the soundtrack..
last page on that topic - 404

I probably wouldnt sell it for less than $100

my only regret is i couldnt really fight in the war
i was egging the haters on
ugh forget it
i got a bunch of friend requesrs
i choose to interpret that as (no ponies) are (gae, 'objectionable'), wich makes it praise for ponies
