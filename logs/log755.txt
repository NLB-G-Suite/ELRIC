Dash is so fast, time itself is fluid to her.
StupidSexyCJ: yes

AttackWithHugs: Neh, they warp you to the past and feed on the amount of time they displaced you.
weeping angels are those things from minercrapht right?
Dat stalker
theres a mod for it
cachi01|blackcops2: *facepalm*
Listening to Smile Precure music atm.
http://ponybot.net/?i=5845
cachi01|blackcops2: thats a mod for this
they're like apps!
Iwa, explain please? I'm considering getting into Doctor Who.
And how come that if they only move when someone isn't looking, they didn't just leave the house after all this time, or is it because of closed doors and stuff?
o_o
The Cure Peace character song is brilliant.
not enough pinkies
AttackWithHugs, I'd start with the 9th doctor to get a feel for the series, I'm sure you'll love it.
Prince_Lightstar: mods? is that like a hack?
FlutterPie: Keep watching, you'll see
Never enough Pinkies.
Fat guy
redneck
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umg08f0K54g
Prince_Lightstar: you know you can get banne for that right?
they send you back in time and feed off your time energy that could have been for the future
Flafi hasn't seen Doctor Who before?
Okey dokey :)
Prince_Lightstar: i will report you
David Tennant is Best Doctor.
cachi01|blackcops2: wtf
hi and is it some kind of comedy movie or is it my imagination?
hi, new here
dabi, besides when you stream, no I havent
cachi01|blackcops2: mods r like stuff that u put in mc
Like Asian Women? These women desperately want a boyfriend! (Join now) *warning these girls will pursue you. These ads...

Prince_Lightstar: lol i was jus trollin a little
Oops. :I
Mubbad.
DAVID TENNNANT FTW
while during the stream
They're pursue you? That's kinda frightening.
cachi01|blackcops2: well u did a bad ob
cachi01|trolled
i know :D
BronyDarth, AdBlock Plus is your friend
job i hate mah j key
AttackWithHugs: I'm not sure if it's explained enough in the episode we are now watching, but it's just, they attempt to get you as far back in time as they can, and practically waste your life of the point you arrive till the time you get warped away...so by ageing in the past due to them, you will give them more "energy"
who's streaming?
Oh, i forgot i had this episode on my computer.
who's streaming?
AttackWithHugs... Well... I kinda like some ads, they turn out to be weird.

05Canebridge: they moved closer to you
Canebridge: The angels would get you.
The screen has a static effect, and then- no wait.
And then they troll you
Canbridge, they trap you in the past or snap your neck
Then sex
Canebridge: they are only statues when you can see them
Troll time
Especially sex.

So this is why she died?
The Danish voices for Finding Nemo are twice as good, lol
ded
MEOWMEOW
Oh god, the amount of spam when we get to the Mine scene...wonder if people will mix Funs in to it
Verspa: yes
She wanted to save the kids, so she sacrificed her self
dat maternal instinct
Jesus disney is satanic
J_E_Smith71, more than likely
stream why me i want to watch a movie not a power point presenation
Yes, we should mix "FUN" into the seagull sequence. :P
NOW I UNDERSTAND HOW SHE DIES! AFTER LIKE, 7 YEARS!
Wrek: Chat is too fast for proper discourse in the style we usually prusue in the twilight_sparkle room
I has a sad now
we are all spartains (spelling) and we are just missing a few people
She is ded... not big suprise.
this love story was better then twilight
It's like 101 Dalmations, but this time it's 399 dead fish babies

05you
ded coral
05actualyl think
05this is fast
Pixar is as dark as early Disney movies were.
Here's something that only happens once in a blue moon in a Disney movie. A character dies and does NOT come back.
Curse you motherly instinct to your children!
05compared to earlier today
05really
BARRACUDA.
05I can only laugh
Disney characters die all the time, what're you talking about?
:'(
Damn he lost his wife and 399 kids, all that in one day:(
Nemo in an egg.
Wrek: it was faster then, yes
Kandarihu: Except baddies. They die all the time.
but I don't type fast
*Loves this song*

J_E_Smith71: I was here then

Sadly Disney is full of fuckin teens doing dramatic shit.

FINDING PINKIE PIE
Not enough Dreamworks smirks.
LordDerpington, good point. But outside of villains, Disney has been infamous for the Disney Death.
So what, does that mean that fish school is 90% clown fish?
Om nom nom, Caviar.
Foorst dai o' school.
Found Nemo, movie over
but they don't show how they are dying , thy aren't showed :P
I mean, wheres Disney full of movies grown ups actually enjoy.
The villains' symbolic 'rise', and ultimate 'fall'.
Disney had some really darks tuff before
Buffering...
I hate being stuck in those
Totally Pinkie Pie
:)
05keepign kids deluted from the Absolute of death is in my oppinion cruel
You know, considering his history, Marlen is perfectly justified to be so protective of his only son.

My mother said when her grandmother died, she wasn't even allowed to go to the funeral- keeping kids in the dakr about is probably very unhealthy
GeeBlitz: It's on youtube
Heeblitz, its on youtube
GeeBlitz: Its on youtuve
cachi01|blackcops2: then go Kill Newbs >:3
I dunno, might wanna do it a bit more.
Nemo is full of adult jokes
Wrek: well, i dont think it should be avoided, but not done too much either
And then we go out, and then back in... JEEZ TALKING ABOUT SEXUALITY
i still have some happy meal toys from back when this movie was new
foreshadowing

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vURYOPuVFfQ S'cuse the video link
SANDY PLANKTON knows no shit
Like later, theres this turtle who acts high.
Wrek probably not
Agreed Wrek - Not saying they need to be directly exposed, but they should know how to handle situations anyway

nope.TOTALY not buffering.<_<>_>
BronyDarth, your mind is a bit stuck in the gutter there.

well that gif is new
That's one sexy seahorse...
lol
I don't think we should shelter kids from death, that's why i don't really like the "fluffy" approach some cartoons take to it.
It's because Disney isn't lazy when it comes to story and plot.
how long is that movie ?
Iwa: dat killspree

Lil_B on the mask it's adress of the kidnappers
BronyDarth, agreed. I'm going by the theory that Hasbro is trying to get the rights to the G1 animations.
Sylandest: well while in this case it would worked, when people run forward from something like a train, they run at maximum speed. if they turn, theylll lose forward speed and risk getting hit

THE ENIGMA'S REVIEW OF FINDING NEMO: Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart. 8.1/10
cue Robbie Williams!
11,02Lil_B: They planned all their movies way in advance
Oh, Blow inflated all the way and STILL couldn't pop the bag. They're screwed.
alexxm: Who knows.
08,01Bronysith: i've never actually played it
At the end there should have just been the sentence "And they eventually starved to death."
Needs more ponies.

They've been getting worse lately. They're getting biased against fiction in general nowadays. In recent years, a movie has to be based on a true story in order to get a best picture Oscar, it seems.

Weird Al has never appeared on the show, though he's said he would very much like to. :)
how will we compete with the hub?
13MadSurge: i've always slept through
I wish I could simply derive humor from the gore being so over the top like the others are. I was honestly getting physically ill from the luncheon scene. I think part of it was the fact that I was ravenously hungry for the Turkey Patties that were being made. I always smell them at that time, and they are GOOOOOOD.
/me laughs at Bronysith for being slapped
Fl00t4sh41, somewhat.
no pony is talking

What might happen, is that the show will end but Hasbro would still creat DVD specials like how they did G3
Could have bolognese for years.
nad nightmare moon
Meanwhile: well then hunger might not be an issue xD

Worst. Uncle. Ever.
lol
just report it
DAT IM GOING NOW
I don't get it. Why is that man taking care of zombies?
DAT BYE
and end this damn movie
Okay. This movie has taken a far more palatable context for all of this. Social awkwardness. Lionel is doing everything he can to cope with the zombification of his mother and a few others, and he's getting a terrible reputation out of it all
XD
oh the humanity
what exactly am i looking at here?
why is he taking care of those zombies?
some hilarious zombie flick
did James Rolfe movie review for this?
hello pony_150577
I TOLD YA HE'S THE VILLAIN.......btw, here's another obviousness.....Bill Murray might be snobby
PLOT POINT
He doesnt want to Jill them
joker4383, because as far as he's concerned, they're still people.
Kill*
at first I though it was dr. who
no
oh ok
pony_8111008 I'LL look it up
lol
don't do it lionel
just leave

The police put a man reporting multiple homicides on hold?
Kandarihu: That's the another thing i like in this film. For a gorefest horror the protagonist character is realy well developed.
\NO YOU WON T\
What a magnificent fat bastard
and call it a bad nightmare

We only see MINE spam during the part of Finding Nemo with the seagulls. We will probably see FUN spam during the later parts of S03E03. And frankly, G-word spam should still be appropriate when those ads are running, but only then.
