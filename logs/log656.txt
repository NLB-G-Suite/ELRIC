00,02XD
sorry >.<
Arrrrrrg
alright, gonna hit the hay now. night all :) hopefully i'll dream of ponies once again
Night this
11,02That is Zelda running in real time on the Wii U in HD ;3;
dem graphics
CaptainXAX
Bah. It was worth a shot
00,02Moopy, 7 types of hair dye and cleverness
00,02hey, listen
shove 7 dyes in hair amd hope for the best
Look out!
Oh wow
I learned a lesson.
11,02Love the reaction when they revealed the name of the Wii U XD
Never challenge a Rush.
00,02WII U
11,02IKR
00,02these names are going to get out of hand real fast
Wii mad tons of money, U gave us that money
made*
11,02:P
lol
It's ambitious.
I'll give it that.
11,02Best part is when they showed Zelda HD in this trailer :)
Oh. The WiiU has HD capabilities?
11,02Yup, up to 1080p
That's news to me.
Huh.
11,02Why would they stick to 480p in their newest system?
11,02If they did that, I'm sure it would fail for sure.
11,02No it's not ;~;
I 'unno. I was wondering why they didn't do that in the first place.
wow... I should be sleep
11,02They didn't realize how fast HD would expand in the market
11,02They thought of it as a slow growing market
I own a GameBoy. The grey brick one.
00,02silly devs misusing it was the problem
11,02When they realized that most families have HDTVs now, they realized it was crucial to include it with their system.
11,02No way
00,02things were playable on the massive base on sd screens
...wat.
Remember that time when Xbox thought they came up with a never before thought of idea with Kinect?
Lol, eye-toy.
00,02Piratejazz, but not the other way round
11,02The selling point with the Wii was its low price point and motion controls
Cool i got me some grapes and got me 2 oranges
00,02but yeah, by now everyone has an hd screen
But the other consoles has SD ports too.
11,02Which two? o.o
00,02guess which works
11,02Wii? :3
00,02NewSuperBronyU, those buggers never die
I'm going to say the PS3?
11,02Well...mine died after my friends kept knocking it over on its side while playing Brawl with the GCN controllers >>
11,02Had to replace the disc drive
I brought my desktop out into the lounge and tried to play the vidya games on my 40'. A) There was a delay time that was just noticeable enough from when I moved my mouse to when it moved on screen that made games unplayable for ME. B) I was squinting the whole time because I'm not used to playing games on a TV.
Probably needed to sit closer to the screen.
11,02Darn
Epic Movie
no kick for me
I might actually buy a Wii U for alot of benificial reasons.
trying to find micas hidden kick words
11,02I think you mean Fight Club

Can't we just let the man stream his Wii U vidoes?
bbl.
11,02YAY ^-^
Good night, everypony.
I'll see you guys maybe tomorrow
00,02'action managment game'
I'm out of here
11,02NINTENDO :O
11,02moo :3
helllllllooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
11,02PirateStar: O.O
:3
incredible graphics....
11,02ikr :D
Realism and CoD in the same sentense? o.o
This doesn't add up
11,02Yesh it does :<
:P
not really
want incredible graphics? go get crysis 1
awwwww yeaaaaaaaa
Arrrrrrrrrg
11,02The resolution is 854x480
11,02Nintendo still hasn't revealed the main OS that runs all this together
11,021 GB out of the total 2 GB
00,02NewSuperBronyU, technically speaking i meen
11,02What do you define as the classical definition? >>
11,02Techincally it does
00,02NewSuperBronyU, a resource sharing subsystem
11,02It just doesn't allow you access to it
11,02The Wii OS didn't support Multitasking is all
00,02NewSuperBronyU, beleive me, it isnt
11,02Source?
11,02Because the Wii does utilize some of its memory for running the OS in the background, but not much.
Personally, I only liked the multiplayer of CoD.
But MW3's was pretty terrible imo.
I much much prefered BO's.
11,02I hope ELITE is compatible with the Wii U version
My cousin plays CoD, but I have no idea which one it is. =/
Just assume it's MW3/
00,02and then my connection died
00,02NewSuperBronyU, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z81BCko-UY and the ascisciated blogs and wiki pages
big*
Tbh, the ONLY thing MW3 had in comparison was its Single Player.
Gday everyone.
Pirates... Pirates everywhere. :O
Yarr.
00,02yay~ i just did an intercontinental flight in ksp
Arrrrrrg
00,02now to try land
ARRRR
00,02NewSuperBronyU, i'm not sure exactly
00,02oh, this bit
Yar.
Hmmm. Good to hear.
^-^
11,0264 MB to 2 GB is pretty legit :)
Yarr!
NEVER STOPPED US BEFORE!
mfw you changed yer name because U :3
YARR, Wirisme~
YARRRRRRR... every year dammit
Arrrr
Arrr, that be a fine idear
00,02most of these bugs happened because the main dev team was in japan while the people working on ios were contractors in the us
00,02XD
00,02Kandarihu|ARRRRRRRRR, this is actually about getting homebrew code onto the wii
arrrrrg
11,02Why is it 'Talk-Like-A-Pirate' Day? ><
00,02NewSuperBronyU, i have no idea
Arrr!
Arrrrrrrrrrrrg!~
00,02Piratejazz, XD
YAHAHA I'M OFF TO R@PE THE VILLAGE WOMEN!
00,02to get back to the home menu it reboots
00,02NewSuperBronyU, the ingame bit where it gives you a button to return to the home menu, THAT is on the disk, the home menu itself is stored on the wii.
00,02in contrast to the xbox 360 and ps3 where it runs in the background
11,02I know they run the OS in the background
DO WE STILL GET TO DRINK RUM!?
The rum is gone.
11,02Otherwise it doesn't work
WHY IS THE RUM GONE!?
^
Why is the rum always gone?
Because I drank it! >8D
Thou be a scallywag!
Arrr! :D
00,02and it restarts in the home menu
hmm..............
11,02What you refer to as the 'Home Menu' is different to how I refer to it
You are a pirate!~
00,02NewSuperBronyU, yeah, we're getting stuck there
Yar har fiddle-dee dee!
11,02The Channels Menu is the main menu that you see when the system starts up
11,02From there you can access all the games and such you have stored on the system
11,02The Home Menu is the menu that appears when you press the 'Home' Button
11,02The Home menu is completely different from the Channels menu
11,02Yes, that's the 'HOME Menu' :P
00,02NewSuperBronyU, http://www.scendix.com/jaast/images/setup_wii_menu.jpg this bit is stored on the wii
11,02The HOME Menu is completely separate from the Channels menu
11,02That's why I'm saying, the developer is in full control of how much memory can be allocated to running the HOME Menu
Arrrrrrrg!~
hi every :)
oh, Console hacking :D
YARR!~
For now.
11,02But most of the time it's worthless to consider for how most developers develop games for the system
I
I'll be Guybrush threepwood :3
Oh noes! Not the dread skurvy.
00,02absolute pain to install but it exists
I wanna see of they hack the WiiU XD
I just realized.
11,02With only 64 MB of RAM, you need all of it you can get with the system.
I really like the 25c3 logo.
11,02Especially for games like CoD
>mfw CoD running on 64mb of ram
00,02NewSuperBronyU, plus not having an os meens you dont talk to an os, instead you talk directly to the hardware
11,02That's one of the reasons why the Wii version didn't get killcams and certain killstreaks that other consoles had. Not because of the processing power, it was because of the RAM.
00,02theres all kinds of tricks you can do with direct hardware access
00,02brb,
11,02The Map data couldn't be entirely stored on the RAM, it had to be constantly read from the disc
11,02So the result was two things
T_T
is there a stream on atm?
11,02Shane: Yesh
11,02Shane: Yesh :3
11,02And why the system is fail from a developer perspective
oh
11,02Shane: No o.o
11,02But on the plus side of all this
11,02Shane: Go ahead :)
night dude
mind you this was before the ps3 hack kneejerk patch

Failure is a learning state.

Mission Failed just means Lesson Learned.
Yame throught be hurtin
Think you have enough fuel left to...oh you let go.
00,02Nyst, for minmus?
You should really use that leftover fuel to try and land on the launch platform.
00,02MAYBE, but i'm not a good enough pilot
Or Minmus, hadn't thought of that.
00,02Nyst, no where near enough
now to spend 30 minutes listening to music before school
00,02Nyst, i would have to slow from like 4km/s to 2
00,02enough to get me into the atmosphere
00,02Nyst, i meen i COULD air break, but not that good yet
But you'd land it with the launchpad visibly nearby.
wut
00,02Nyst, couldnt land it, it cant slow itself down in the atmosphere
i never said anything about it
DONT FALL DOWN OR YOU'LL DIE

That's public school for ya

...seriously?
thats stupid
08,01because they don't think school is important

Cheerilee's Garden was really good though

I enjoy Rainbow Factory myself
havent read Rainbow Factory. well, i read a riff fic on it
I watched Season 6, went back and watched Season 5. I watched the first episodes of Season 1

haven't watched 11 yet
why not
and I'm thinking on watching the oldies
before 11
Well you are a curious person. I would rather read all of Lord of the Rings books before watching Doctors 1-8
ty
But some of the old episodes are lost, right?
And trust me, those books were on my list for a long time
Same here.
because, police blimps
I have to draw the line somewhere.

yeah, he's #10
HELLO

NOOOOO
well since it's a shorter season, it might debut later than the other seasons
oh this is wonderful
I find it more depressing than anything.
you actually listened to other people?
rather than verify for yourself?
If it doesn't come directly from the Hub, I don't believe it

YEAH TOAST!
If the date had been confirmed we'd all know it by now
considering you just had to pay attention
don't.

Trying to process that, seeing as I'm not all that knowledgeable in the field...
*saw
But that's pretty far out, isn't it?
atmosphere ends at 80KM
Freeman's mind is the best thing ever
...Freeman's Mind?
mun is 11400KM
its a fairly far out orbit
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjswPjGnKN0&feature=BFa&list=FLF7smc0TDtWWIknqKADKOUw
it's only 11400KM to mun?
freemans mind. how many episodes still its done? i say about 10 more
i would have parked it lower with the other stage but its still fiddly to control
*sadface
that's like 1/3 of the distance from earth to the moon
I have seeen and played alot o tings.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgZXiHfNt0M
makes it easier to orbit
more fun that way

YOU WANNA HEAR WHINING? THIS IS WHINING!
I thought that read 2012 when I first saw it XD
and yes, hi all XD
00,02Lil_B, tbh i didnt see it until i was older
00,02old enough that society was trying to push me away from catoons, but not old enough to get the humor
You did not........

YOU DID NOT!
^ Reminds me of The Room.
And now Rarity is looking at the 4th wall ''just look at me''
00,10oh hi all
The movie or episodes?
I'm used to the US version
05plus at this point heroic has a -35% on all stats on the bosses
05so its understadnable to how they managed
05deathcoil to heal
05plus the self healf opf DK tanks
Hey everypony
05it adds up really
don't get me wrong, I think it's cool that they managed to pull it off
00,10not supprised at all it's all DK's
That's hilarious.
00,02Sumica, 0.17 is out
00,10yeah I know
00,02i've got work to do
00,10tryed telling you yesterday there was a patch coming
00,02ah well
00,10but yeah the all DK thing been doing that for ages
DKs were not designed to handle being healers
00,10Dk's were realy a pita when they had the self rez
Hello everyone.
Do DKs still have that corpse res thing?
05healign DK is somewhat viable apparently
05yeah
0518k absorbon shield on friendly targets
"Healing DK is somewhat viable"
"Somewhat viable"
05its still outclassed by proper healign classes
05but with a well geared tank
I find it tragic that DK's can heal anyone other than themselves at all.
05Serenity: yeah that was hilarious :D
Heya everyone :)
I did it :3
The World of Warcraft, it is a silly place.
05sleep well
00,10Sleep time is nao
And now, Helix Nebula
I'm amazed how many of you played or play WoW
Back in my day we had to walk to the dungeon.
Dude*
00,02more than twice as efficent in vacume as the old ones
WoW....never saw the appeal behind it.
YEAH TOAST!
Screw pandas, Monks are where it's at
Well, they made /4 didn't they?
No one used /4 !
(is 15 now :P)
00,10have bank and tabbard
00,10also found digimon 01 in dual audio
Unfortunately, because most of my time is spent at school
I can never get into raids because I simply don't have enough hours put in
Next time I'm gonna play it is with you guys
IMO, it went to shithole state at 1.8
^That.
:D
I won't play WoW, cause I would just be jumping into something that's already ancient and I heard it's worse since all the changes.
Allow me to "LOLi"
LOL!*
Ancient? WoW? You should look at EVERQUEST
THAT is ancient
Everquest isn't shit, it's just unfair as bullfuck
/me doesn't get the appeal behind RPGs
And yet I still play it...
WoW isn't ancient. It just looks that way.
WoW is really demanding for it's technology, it shows how shitty the engine is nowadys
Heyo.
My old laptop is transferrring shit at 3mb/s
My tower transfers at 600 MB/s...
>doesn't see the appeal behind RPGs
Atm, I play Guild Wars 2.
>played zOMG! on Gaia Online for about 2 years
>Insert facedesk here
I've played some Spiral Knights. Not much of an MMO really.
Parp?
Spiral Knights was amusing for a while.
^
Oh yeah, should mention I overclock them as well
/me facehoof
^ suprised
Aye
It was?
Managed one playthrough of D3.
^
Haven't touched it since.
Yes
Don't mistake disappointment for worse.
heh
D3 wasn't really bad, just disappointing for the time it took to be released and the restrictions in place on it
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvrKTNJfRTI SFM. Amazing program.
finally found a good webshop in geermany with MLP-shirts, :) getdigital.de
lol
I'm feeling nostalgic for evasion tanking...
XD
My annoyance to Hunters passed over when I ninja'd Thori'dal from 2.
I totally need to get the warglaives
Did you also leave group and hearth afterwards? XD
I /really/ wanted to go to BB
Well, I say ninjad. I won it fair and square but the crying I got for it would tell you otherwise.
Should of left group and hearthed, then never talked to them ever again, just to seal the deal.
BiS statstick. Ofc I needed it.
Ahh, okay
Everytime they pm you for a group or something, immediately go into DND mode XD
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Toywiz Lists Collector Sets and Fluttershy Plushies for Pre-Order
I played a rogue.
Ugh. Gross
You know, worlds first Thori'dal drop went to a rogue.
Because we totally couldn't get our greedy mitts on enough legendaries by then anyway.
Oh well.
Even now, rogues have barely any legendarys
Which makes owning it that much more fun.
Only huntards can use bows now.
I'm a rogue, I couldn't even use that when it was current.
I know you can't
Why does no one ever mention the Ulduar legendary?
Because I can't wield Val'anyr?
But Ulduar was like, the best instance.
I prefer Naxxramas. OLD Naxxramas.
People don't think of it
Still have five splinters of Atiesh. *sniff*
But Wrath was probably the best expac content wise
Old Naxxramas caused night terrors.
I mean Ulduar, vehicles
HELLO
Think he meant splinters.
Oh right.
Yeah ^
Also 40 :P
back from shower :D
I know it's a 40 raid
hi there
Because only like, 100 people still have their Tier 3.
To any mod-person, am I allowed to quickly post an image link?
yes
You're allowed to post image links all the time, unless they're nsfw.
This was just after I got my Dragonwrath:
http://i517.photobucket.com/albums/u338/lasharus123/WoWScrnShot_040712_223550.jpg
As I understand it, image links are always allowed, as long as you don't spam a whole bunch of 'em
Never seen Tarecgosa mount
Looks like Tarecgosa.
I find it stupid how Monks can't use Daggers
http://i517.photobucket.com/albums/u338/lasharus123/WoWScrnShot_040712_224402.jpg
I find it stupid how Warriors can use staves.
Yeah.
I don't like them imo
I prefer proto drakes
I don't mind 'em too much.
You mean five colours?
Mm.
I think that's the lot.
You've got the time-lost one?
hi
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwhrUYFwxgE&feature=g-vrec

Twice.
When he told me about it he flew off the edge of Dalaran, without any mounts to help him.

NPCScan? :P
Hm. I can't get gizoogle to work. I want to translate the US Constitution into jive.
/me sigh
Least you got it. :P
Nah, I got it.
It could be worse
Now you cry.
And, equally importantly, which region?
We're both EU
Dammit, Hellscream here
Turalyon EU.
Entire team is EU.
/me sips tea and adjusts his monocle.
Leading to many remarks such as 'm'lady', which are mildly vexi- OY!

/me steps to one side.
Nice to see you again kirz- Oof. Yeah, that was the ground. Ow.
Anyway, I'm from the Netherlands.
Lash is pseudo-Brit
Grmpf.

I'm sure we can make you an honourary Englishmen.
Two of 'em?
(I'm sure you meant 'EnglishMAN, but I'm a cynic)
Wow, haha
lol
lol
could make you an honourary Englishwoman if you keep whining about it :P
That'd be English lady.
Oh look. Some one "barrowed" Wreks work. http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-exyw6lye2ko/UFpJI1giRkI/AAAAAAAA45w/IIpfvQR_t2s/s1600/1.jpg

Hehe
oh? did somebosy say tea?
Are we arguing?
We are merely having a gentlemanly discussion.
ohai*
Alright cleverdick, debate
Yep. And they used it to borrow it as well.
Also, "clever dick" would be two words.

I don't remember this... Why don't I remember this... This bothers me greatly... o_o

Have some more commercials. :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&v=Pzth7hcueTs&NR=1
*young

He's still a cartoon. XD

Made a place for all cartoons as if they are working
well time to head out, bbl
IKR?
yeah

yeah
exactly
And I must say it's aged very well. It STILL looks good today.
Pinkie would feel at home in that movie :D
haha
Yep. :D
yeah
Pinkie would make SENSE in that movie
Everything she does can be written off as "she's a toon"
Nice.
OK, spoof... "who framed Pinkie Pie
She would be the RULER of Toons. :D
needs to be made now
I AM THE LAW
I know. :D
yeah
HE NEVER BLINKS IN THE WHOLE MOVIE
yeah
I still like him in the dream team
You wouldn't think that's much, but then you watch the scene where he's monologuing about his freeway plan. o_o
Yeah
His eyes as a toon always freaked me out when I was a kid.
I think I can do that too if I concentrate :D
Oh.
I was also freaked out when he got squashed. o_o
