How did you know? ;_;
11,02:3
NewSuperBronyU :) not play the yoshi song!

Poly_D_Nami, well, I'm going off the assumption because I downloaded a SOAD Discography and that song was in it.
NewSuperBronyU: You talking about 'fitting' reminded me of your attempts to get the Rhythm Fortress audio to go along perfectly with you playing Rhythm Heaven Fever :D
Pirate_Rush|Zzz, you are welcome!

11,02That is Zelda running in real time on the Wii U in HD ;3;
Hey guys how can i get my hair colors turned into rainbows like rainbow dashes mane?

Bah. It was worth a shot
00,02Moopy, 7 types of hair dye and cleverness
sweet thanks phase4
Moopy, duct tape, lots and lots of duct tape.
I WILL NOT LISTEN!
00,02hey, listen
shove 7 dyes in hair amd hope for the best
Look out!
11,02If they make a Zelda game exactly like this, I think I would just pass out right then and there O.O
Oh wow
00,02attack the shiny bit
I heard Navi
i rather not go with the duck tape dude it hurts when you pull it off
I learned a lesson.
11,02Love the reaction when they revealed the name of the Wii U XD
Never challenge a Rush.
00,02WII U
11,02IKR
00,02these names are going to get out of hand real fast
11,02I would have been kind of dissappointed if they left the circle pads on the final version
Wii mad tons of money, U gave us that money
made*
11,02:P
11,02Love how everyone thought the baseball game was somehow a part of the Wii U experience XD
11,02Until it turns out later that it actually was o-o
Am I still the only one who'd buy the Wii U for Zombie U?
lol
11,02ZombiU is a cool game :)
and then Panda only bought the Wii U to draw on it.
It's ambitious.
I'll give it that.
11,02Best part is when they showed Zelda HD in this trailer :)
11,02Then the dissapointment when it turns out it wasn't an actual planned game yet ;3;
Oh. The WiiU has HD capabilities?
11,02Yup, up to 1080p
That's news to me.
Huh.
11,02Why would they stick to 480p in their newest system?
Might look into it if I'm tired of the PS4.
because nintendo is worst pony
11,02If they did that, I'm sure it would fail for sure.
11,02No it's not ;~;
I 'unno. I was wondering why they didn't do that in the first place.
but i like nintendo ;__;
wow... I should be sleep
11,02They didn't realize how fast HD would expand in the market
11,02They thought of it as a slow growing market
I own a GameBoy. The grey brick one.
00,02people keept yelling at nintendo for the wiimotes and motion controll
That's the only Nintendo product I have.
11,02Back when the PS3 and Xbox 360 came out, it was still relatively new tech in TVs
00,02but its not nintendo that was the issue
00,02silly devs misusing it was the problem
11,02When they realized that most families have HDTVs now, they realized it was crucial to include it with their system.
00,02NewSuperBronyU, from what i've read the lack of hd was a selling point for the wii
11,02No way
im off to bed night everypony :)
00,02things were playable on the massive base on sd screens
...wat.
Remember that time when Xbox thought they came up with a never before thought of idea with Kinect?
Lol, eye-toy.
HDtvs have SD jacks, though.
00,02XAX, eye toy was fun
00,02Piratejazz, but not the other way round
Pirate4: That it was
11,02The selling point with the Wii was its low price point and motion controls
Cool i got me some grapes and got me 2 oranges
Pirate4, oh wait. I see.
00,02but yeah, by now everyone has an hd screen
11,02But now that PS3 and Xbox 360 are cheaper in price and they include motion controls, there was no longer a true benefit to having the Wii.
But the other consoles has SD ports too.
11,02So it was time for the Wii U to come out to compete with the other systems while doing something new that the other systems couldn't compete with.
00,02NewSuperBronyU, i've got all 3 consoles, two of them are broken
11,02Which two? o.o
00,02guess which works
/me slaps Pirate4 around a bit with a large trout
11,02Wii? :3
00,02NewSuperBronyU, those buggers never die
I'm going to say the PS3?
/me slaps JRP2234 around a bit with a large trout
11,02Well...mine died after my friends kept knocking it over on its side while playing Brawl with the GCN controllers >>
11,02Had to replace the disc drive
11,02But other than that, it was fixed good as new :)
I brought my desktop out into the lounge and tried to play the vidya games on my 40'. A) There was a delay time that was just noticeable enough from when I moved my mouse to when it moved on screen that made games unplayable for ME. B) I was squinting the whole time because I'm not used to playing games on a TV.
Probably needed to sit closer to the screen.
11,02Darn
Epic Movie
no kick for me
I might actually buy a Wii U for alot of benificial reasons.
trying to find micas hidden kick words
11,02I think you mean Fight Club

sumi has secret kick words?
11,02Sumica probably disabled that script ><

/me slaps NewSuperBronyU around a bit with a large trout
11,02Here it comes :D

00,02this will be fun
suıbǝq ʇı
11,02I think showing Zelda HD would have been an awesome way to show what the system could do ;3;
Piratejazz: 9001 points
there we go
I're winner.
11,02I like watching reaction videos :3
Hey, SB, the tablet /can/ play games without a TV screen right?
00,02< this is as powerfull as a game console needs to be
11,02Piratejazz: Yup
11,02Pirate4: yuppers :P
NewSuperBronyU, so does that mean one can just buy a Wii U and not even need a TV?
NewSuperBronyU play castlevania
Like just play from bed and stuff.
00,02after this all you can do is improve details. we're at the point where the difference is art and not tech
11,02Piratejazz: But it depends on which Wii U game you play. HOWEVER, I believe you can play ALL Wii games on the Gamepad.
NewSuperBronyU, damn. Really just want one for ZombiU.
11,02Then get it :O
sony commercial on a nintendo video
00,02NewSuperBronyU, y u no adblock
Know what.
11,02Pirate4: I sorries ;~;
I will.

00,02Polydunami, the fun part is that nintendo gets paid for that ad
NewSuperBronyU HE MADE ZELDA

I love it

Oh dinner tiem.

Right, I'd like to stay longer but I might fall asleep. So I might as well go to bed.
11,02YAY ^-^
Good night, everypony.
I'll see you guys maybe tomorrow
11,02Dat feeling where if the Wii U Gamepad screen comes with a dead pixel having to go and exchange it out for a new system...
00,02'action managment game'
I'm out of here
11,02Btw, 60 days \:3/
11,02i liek nintendo :3c
11,02NINTENDO :O
00,02i think sb likes nintendo
11,02moo :3
SB is best nintendo fan boy
helllllllooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
11,02PirateStar: O.O
11,02Hai Resonantwaves :D
:3
ohai Resonantwaves
howdy!
incredible graphics....
11,02ikr :D
Realism and CoD in the same sentense? o.o
This doesn't add up
11,02Yesh it does :<
:P
not really
want incredible graphics? go get crysis 1
o3o whats everyone doing
11,02Resonantwaves: Watching Nintendo o3o
awwwww yeaaaaaaaa
11,02Only thing that I hope looks better than it actually sounds is the resolution of the Gamepad screen...
Arrrrrrrrrg
11,02The resolution is 854x480
11,02Still perfect for regular Wii games though
11,02I want this game at launch ;3;
11,02I just wonder how the online features will work...will it have DLC? Achievements? Universal Friend List?
11,02Nintendo still hasn't revealed the main OS that runs all this together
11,02But it takes up half the memory of the system, so it must be pretty impressive
11,021 GB out of the total 2 GB
00,02thats a point, they're actually going to have an operating system this time
Good morning Bronystate
sounds like windows to me
11,02They had an operating system before, but it really wasn't a unified one while playing games and such
11,02Hey Gold_Demona :)
00,02NewSuperBronyU, technically speaking i meen
11,02Every game console has an OS on it though
00,02the wii didnt have an operating system by the clasical definition
11,02What do you define as the classical definition? >>
00,02when you launched a game it handed controll to the games software, the wii dashbord doesnt exist while your running
11,02Techincally it does
11,02It just doesn't allow you access to it
If I recall, thar be a surly swarm of Miis standing around each game.
11,02The Wii OS didn't support Multitasking is all
00,02NewSuperBronyU, and no, its not there, the thing that pops up when you press the home button isnt the dashboard, its actually implimented in every game
11,02No it's not, that's the Wii's OS running in a limited fashion while running the game.
00,02NewSuperBronyU, beleive me, it isnt
o3o?
11,02Source?
11,02Because the Wii does utilize some of its memory for running the OS in the background, but not much.
11,02Hence why it's limited to what you can do when you press the Home button
Personally, I only liked the multiplayer of CoD.
But MW3's was pretty terrible imo.
I much much prefered BO's.
11,02I hope ELITE is compatible with the Wii U version
My cousin plays CoD, but I have no idea which one it is. =/
Just assume it's MW3/
11,02I also hope the Wii U version comes with the Care Package version of the game >>
I think it's Black Ops, but I wouldn't swear to it
00,02and then my connection died
00,02NewSuperBronyU, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z81BCko-UY and the ascisciated blogs and wiki pages
And then Pirate tiem died with Pirate4.
i remember my brig bro said TF2 is the same as MW3... lol
big*
00,02NewSuperBronyU, if one wants to get technical, there is the os on the starlet, but that doesnt handle the dashboard
And a late hello to you Gold_Demona :P
Tbh, the ONLY thing MW3 had in comparison was its Single Player.
Hiyo AdamThePirate
Also, hai Gold_Demona.
Gday everyone.
Pirates... Pirates everywhere. :O
Dat Yarrflash. Long time no see.
Yarr.
00,02yay~ i just did an intercontinental flight in ksp
Gold_Demona, ARRRRRR
Ikr Piratejazz ^^ busy busy.
Arrrrrrg
00,02now to try land
11,02What part of the video talks about it?
ARRRR
Mmmm. Hope your schedules becomes more lax then, Yarrflash.
00,02NewSuperBronyU, i'm not sure exactly
00,02oh, this bit
Yar.
I'm happy with how it is right now though :)
00,02NewSuperBronyU, 'ios' is the persistant part that runs on the starlet
I can help people & stuff. So that's good.
00,02NewSuperBronyU, 'broadway' is the cpu, games run on that and when a game is running it controls the broadway in its entirety
Hmmm. Good to hear.
^-^
So how are you then, Piratejazz?
Phase4, does this mean Pirate tiem is over?
11,0264 MB to 2 GB is pretty legit :)
Yarrflash, been better. school started.
Yarr!
00,02Piratejazz, i'm just not bothering, cant talk like pirate
Yarr, Pirate_Gold_Demona :)
NEVER STOPPED US BEFORE!
/me glomps NewSuperBronyU
Oh shit I just realised what day it is
mfw you changed yer name because U :3
YARR, Wirisme~
YARRRRRRR... every year dammit
Arrrr
Hehe, why don't you name yourself Gold_Demonaarrrg, Pirate_Gold_Demona
Arrr, that be a fine idear
00,02most of these bugs happened because the main dev team was in japan while the people working on ios were contractors in the us
NewSuperBronyU, Aye, so THIS be your contribution to Talk like a Pirate Day?
00,02XD
00,02Kandarihu|ARRRRRRRRR, this is actually about getting homebrew code onto the wii
arrrrrg
11,02Why is it 'Talk-Like-A-Pirate' Day? ><
00,02NewSuperBronyU, i have no idea
/me hugs Yarrflash back :D
Tis be a ninja I say TheRandomkid321
Because Captain Phase4.
Oi, Phase4. YOU STARTED THIS! :D
ARRGH! IMA DRINK ME RUM!
Arrr!
NewSuperBronyU: it's because pirates are cool. Yarrr.
Arrrrrrrrrrrrg!~
00,02Piratejazz, XD
11,02So you're saying that each game has to include code on the discs to run the Wii Home Menu OS?
YAHAHA I'M OFF TO R@PE THE VILLAGE WOMEN!
11,02And it's up to the game maker as to how much memory is allocated to running it?
...we're not that kind of pirate crew.
00,02NewSuperBronyU, the home menu is stored on the wii, the behaviour of the home button is implimented on the game disks
ANND MURDER THEIR HUSBANDS! THEN R@APE THEM AGAIN! THEN STEAL THEIR GOLD!
00,02to get back to the home menu it reboots
Piratejazz We're not?
Yarr, I swing not that way, TheRandompirate321
11,02The Home menu I refer to what happens when you press the Home button on the Wii Remote
11,02You just said that OS isn't running by the system, it's running by the game
TheRandompirate321, /we're/ not.
00,02NewSuperBronyU, the ingame bit where it gives you a button to return to the home menu, THAT is on the disk, the home menu itself is stored on the wii.
00,02when a game is running, the home menu isnt
00,02in contrast to the xbox 360 and ps3 where it runs in the background
11,02I know they run the OS in the background
11,02Most likely, if they did it, it was to maximize the amount of memory running for a particular game by the game developer
DO WE STILL GET TO DRINK RUM!?
00,02NewSuperBronyU, when a game is running its the only thing running on the main cpu
11,02So that they could utilize less memory to run the Home Menu in the background while offering more for the actual game
11,02But the game has to allocate some memory to running that Home menu should the user press the Home button
The rum is gone.
11,02Otherwise it doesn't work
WHY IS THE RUM GONE!?
^
Why is the rum always gone?
Arrg nay, we get to drink frying pan, tf2 style~
Because I drank it! >8D
Thou be a scallywag!
AdamThePirate Yaah that game don't work for me no more.
Arrr! :D
o3o
00,02NewSuperBronyU, how the game impliments the home menu is up to the game, afaik nintendo's dev kits include the code to do that, but clicking 'return to the home menu' reboots the cpu
00,02and it restarts in the home menu
hmm..............
Do what you want 'cause a pirate is free~
11,02What you refer to as the 'Home Menu' is different to how I refer to it
You are a pirate!~
00,02NewSuperBronyU, yeah, we're getting stuck there
AJIsAwesome|Sleep: are u awake?
Yar har fiddle-dee dee!
11,02The Channels Menu is the main menu that you see when the system starts up
11,02From there you can access all the games and such you have stored on the system
11,02The Home Menu is the menu that appears when you press the 'Home' Button
11,02The Home menu is completely different from the Channels menu
11,02The Home menu is the only thing that runs when a game is being played
the channels menu is what I belive he is refering to here NewSuperBronyU
11,02The Channels Menu can't be played at all by the game due to the lack of memory in having it run
00,02NewSuperBronyU, http://derpy.me/64Hkq << this bit is stored on the game disk and controlled by the game
11,02Yes, that's the 'HOME Menu' :P
00,02NewSuperBronyU, http://www.scendix.com/jaast/images/setup_wii_menu.jpg this bit is stored on the wii
11,02The HOME Menu is completely separate from the Channels menu
well, Im off!
00,02and it stopps running, removes itself from memory, and transfers controll of the cpu to the game when it starts
11,02Later DoctoDoctorWho :)
Gnight, DoctoDoctorWho. Plunder well in thar dreams.
Night DoctoDoctorWho
11,02That's why I'm saying, the developer is in full control of how much memory can be allocated to running the HOME Menu
actually I just got up, this is my morning visit. To a new day of glory and plunder!
11,02If Nintendo isn't controlling it from the main Channels OS on the system, then the developer is free to controlling what it does
00,02NewSuperBronyU, point is the 'home menu' isnt part of an operating system, its on the game
Arrrrrrrg!~
11,02Yeah, that's what I'm trying to agree with you here silly :P
/me 00,02hugs NewSuperBronyU
/me hugs Phase4 back :3
FRIENDSHIP!
hi every :)
11,02The HOME Menu, because it's dependent on how the developer uses it, can choose to allocate less memory in having it run in the background while the game is played and thus use more of it to run the game
oh, Console hacking :D
I cristen our new ship the FriendShip!
/me hugs Lil_B all pirate like.
Welcome aboard Lil_B, arrrg!~
/me hugs Lil_B *pat pat*
11,02Hence why some high performing games don't show a blurried snapshot of what's on the screen when you open the Home Menu so that it doesn't waste precious memory resources to storing that image to be displayed in the background
are we pirate themed?
YARR!~
For now.
11,02But most of the time it's worthless to consider for how most developers develop games for the system
Yarrrr that be correct, international talk like a pirate day!~
It be Talk Like a Pirate Day. Yarr
/me gives Piratejazz AdamThePirate a skirrrrrvvy hug
I
00,02<< the dvd-video bug was actually exploited and eventually a softmod to play burned games was made
I'll be Guybrush threepwood :3
God DAMN my iPod just dropped hard on my face. I need to stop holding it above myself.
Oh noes! Not the dread skurvy.
11,02That's the only reason I can think of as to why Nintendo wouldn't run the code on the system end itself
00,02absolute pain to install but it exists
11,02Nintendo failed at coding their Wii system, hence why it has all this homebrew stuff.
I wanna see of they hack the WiiU XD
00,02NewSuperBronyU, well theres not a lot of cpu to play with, not having an operating system sitting betwene your game and the system only gains you about 10% but you sometimes need that
at least Nintendo wasn't such an Asshole about their consoles getting hacked like Sony XD
I just realized.
11,02With only 64 MB of RAM, you need all of it you can get with the system.
I really like the 25c3 logo.
11,02Especially for games like CoD
yay nintendo forever
>mfw CoD running on 64mb of ram
00,02NewSuperBronyU, plus not having an os meens you dont talk to an os, instead you talk directly to the hardware
11,02That's one of the reasons why the Wii version didn't get killcams and certain killstreaks that other consoles had. Not because of the processing power, it was because of the RAM.
00,02theres all kinds of tricks you can do with direct hardware access
00,02brb,
11,02The Map data couldn't be entirely stored on the RAM, it had to be constantly read from the disc
11,02So the result was two things
11,02One, the game couldn't load a different section of the map fast enough for Killcams or even use killstreaks that gave a full view of the map.
T_T
is there a stream on atm?
11,02Two, the disc drive had to be CONSTANTLY checking the disc for Map data and thus texture loading suffered and the Wii drives died early on because they were putting on a huge amount of stress than what other games were putting on it.
11,02Shane: Yesh
wait, what Systenm are tehy currently talking about? This doesn't sound like the Wii they are talking about
NewSuperBronyU: r u streaming?
11,02Shane: Yesh :3
11,02This is the Wii Lil_B
11,02And why the system is fail from a developer perspective
NewSuperBronyU: u streaming games with music in the background?
oh
11,02Shane: No o.o
NewSuperBronyU: k
11,02But on the plus side of all this
11,02The Wii is easily hackable so you can do so much with it without the need for a Mod chip or any hardware modification.
NewSuperBronyU: permission to link a youtube video
11,02Shane: Go ahead :)
Im off to hit the hay everypony see yall in the morning oh and a YEAH TOAST aight late

Night, Moopy.
11,02EpicMario50: Who? o.o
EpicMario50, so?
mind you this was before the ps3 hack kneejerk patch
11,02I think you might be referring to Wrek :/
god
wow
NewSuperBronyU: oh
no
bad
11,02He loves playing games while playing heavy metal music in the background
evil vile wow :)

Yep that sounds like like good ol' Wrek
Or that one time he was playing Infected Mushroom all the time.

Shane: 8:32pm isn't normal for dinner time?
AdamThePirate: the song mainly is vocals and the vocals arent that bad
Gold_DemonaArrrgh: got nothing wrong with it
Shane, yeah her singing is fine, only problem is I usually listen to the intruments more than the vocals
that and I look at lyrics as well, sometimes they can be wonderful
Yay stream
What I hate is having dinner at 4 in the afternoon. Damn early-morning schedule.
AdamThePirate: and sometimes there like wut are they saying?
and sudden phase stream.

AdamThePirate: my musical taste is probs just very large
Brushie brush
... I hear thunder.
And I saw lightning.
Oh yes. Good weather.

Naturally, if you dont expect something, it would be scary at first
Jump-scares are not really all that frightening in the long term, though. >_>
True.
dont you remember what pinkie said about being scared?
Argh it be true
Giggle at the Slendies?
yes
I'm watching Two Best Friends play it, and I kinda agree with Matt, Slender is pissing me off. The game is almost BORING, honestly, and once you know its gimmick you're basically just waiting for the screen to try another lame jump scare.
Avast me arse!
Did ye know that Pirates had Theatres and Musicians to keep from boredom?
Arrrrrg avast my first pony song!~ :3
lolgimmick
You mean the fact that you're ALWAYS going to die?

So is it impossible to get all 8?
CK|Catnap Did ye know about the slendaaarrrggghhh man before slender?
00,02we could make a game of that
The only time the game has scared me is when I got all 8 pages.

/me ParrotSurge
lol XD
SQUAWK
Yar.
Time for MAX THRUST
i tried making a plane in ksp....all it does is backflips by itself
/me wants a cracker
/me gives ParrotSurge a cracker
00,02basically we go up
00,02and then we fall to the planet over there
d3rb: even when you fail you succeed in Kerbal :D
Would a solid booster be too powerful for leaving Mun?
00,02failure is half the fun
Gold_DemonaArrrgh: *nom*
There's no such thing as too powerful
^
ParrotSurge, that should be on their website
Failure is a learning state.
^
Mission Failed just means Lesson Learned.
im learning like crazy tonight then
Yame throught be hurtin
Think you have enough fuel left to...oh you let go.
00,02Nyst, for minmus?
You should really use that leftover fuel to try and land on the launch platform.
00,02MAYBE, but i'm not a good enough pilot
Or Minmus, hadn't thought of that.
00,02Nyst, no where near enough
Aww, it's nice to see chat people come back because pony season is getting close :)
now to spend 30 minutes listening to music before school
00,02Nyst, i would have to slow from like 4km/s to 2
You have enough fuel to get into kerbal orbit with fuel left over no?
00,02enough to get me into the atmosphere
00,02many times more than enough but doing orbital manouvers as well takes even more
00,02Nyst, i meen i COULD air break, but not that good yet
I'm not saying you need to airbreak. You can still land just the command pod with a parachute.
PsychoticDoc Hardly most you see now are regulars it usually has over 100 users around the right time in a day.
Pirate day over AdamTheDuck?
wut
im lost
00,02Nyst, couldnt land it, it cant slow itself down in the atmosphere
PsychoticDoc Most here have been long after S2 ended

00,02everything went perfectly, bill does not know what to make of this

Bill: "not sure if good thing or not"
/me slaps d3rb around a bit with a large trout
Aww don't be sad JRP2234

Night OneTrickPony
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT_lTfhOtlw
Aw
Hmm...
Sounds like something Wrek listens to :3
So Phase4 May I suggest a song about my pirate ancestor?
00,02lol, totaly accidental minmus encounter
00,02TheRandompirate321, sure
Okay.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_3KVrzcxEI
00,02should i land on minmus or go for a mun landing again?
Had a feelin' twas Monkey Island
minmus!
Minmus!
YAH!
00,02minmus it is
SET SAIL FOR MINMUS! YAH
So... Rather silent seas here
00,02orbital manouvers on minmus are trivial
I love this song. Mainly because it's about my ancestor.
00,02like, on kerbin your dealing in km/s, on mun its hundreds of m/s, on minmus its like 50
Slow sailing tonight
Brb
So... Yah...
Ha ha
about one hour of pirating left.
Twas a fine day talking in pirate speak arrrrg...
Yah. How ye enjoying theses tunes adam?

You said it was about your ancestor but I'm just listening to the instuments in my sleepy state.
00,02oh god the glare
AdamThePirate yeah it's not the easiest song to hear the vocals to.
Too sleepy to pay attention to the lyrics :/
So this is Minum.
It's.... It's so different isn't it mateys.
05http://e621.net/data/e4/ed/e4ed212a51a2505774fd7854aea9d82b.png
Different, not usually what I listen to
00,02hmm
lolwut Warhammer 40K? :D
My pegan friend belives I am my Pirate ancestor reincarnated. Would make sense of my rebellious spirit and love for the ocean.
But not my cowardliness
Reincarnation always intrigued me
00,02i cant see anything
IMO once you are gone you're gone. No second chanches. But I guess noone really knows.
So much glare o.o
TZhe ship is slowly losing height... YAH!
00,02i see ground texture
Adam are you going to school these last two days? You are still in school right?

I'll be asleep.

NEVER ENOUGH ROCKET, Phase4!
No such thing as too much rocket Phase4

Phase4: now make it bigger
indeed, and a new planet conquered
00,02i flew dat thing
00,02LongJohnSylver, but... sleep
Phase4: nuu. Bigger Rocket. Sleep is unnecessary
Sleep is for the people with tiny pirate space ships
lol
08,01i... feel so middle class right now
What are we talking about? :D
08,01see, i went to a posh school
08,01a fee-paying school
08,01i've never really experienced a comprehensive school before
You haven't missed much
08,01and... honestly, the drought of reading and writing skills in some of those kids was terrifying
08,01and the attitudes
That's public school for ya
^
08,01and, apparently, a lot of the parents actively *dissuade* their children from learning and doing schoolwork
what?
...seriously?
thats stupid
08,01because they don't think school is important
/me flips a table
They are going to gar far in life...
*go
/me flips LongJohnSylver
08,01the school i went to today was one of the bottom schools in the country, purely because it's in such a poor area
08,01MLP_Brovakiin: a lot of them will never leave their little town
Eee
>not growing up in poverty
pirate_sprinkle: that was entirely unnecessary
08,01but!
/me flips revlysnhojgnol
08,01there were some kids there who were really enthusiastic about computer science!
ty, pirate_sprinkle

But evil AOL gets in their way.
oh poor netscape, how we haven't heard of her since...ever
00,02Barbetos, netscape evolved into firefox
Magic_Pony: Well, you still can try to use Netscape nowadays
Phase4 pretty much XD
00,02firefox actually still has old netscape code in it
I remember when netscape offered email services and everything.
Phase4: Not exactly. I think it's another people but yes, source is from Netscape
and what i'm looking at exactly? ! 6_9
00,02JunkerKun, no, same people, netscape became mozilla

Magic_Pony I only read up to half of the third book

HEYUP, RaveBrony
Oh bugger
MUFFINZ aka Bye
Ahoy RaveBrony
so you are going?
MadSurge: Think about Tom. Tom is the master of the deepest, darkest part of a dangerous, deadly wood. He is able to wear the One Ring without ANYTHING happening to him. This implies several things, such as Tom Bombadil is secretly the Witch King of Agmar, or better yet, he is the Secret Fire incarnate.
/me waves to Dken2021, Barbetos, Serenity, and HavokOC
im not going
i said what is MUFFINZ means

Barbetos: The invisibility of the One Ring is explained to be because it draws your being into the Wraith realm, the realm of spirit. To wear the one ring and not be effected implies you already wholy exist in the spirit realm

2K is a s**t. In a bad way
Meeeh, gonna play some sims probably.
Have you heard about story with Borderlands 2 in Russia and Baltic region?
they have naught dog, and rockstar and other companies
Uhm me? , nope
why what about b2 in russia?
2K made Borderlands 2 in Russia only with russian translation and avialable to play only with Russian versions
oh
The joke is that Baltic region pays European price but gets Russian version
hey have translations all over
:O
ahh yeah
So now me and my friends have to cancel our pre-order since we don't want to play with Russian translation
Right
I'm back
That is understandable

I am guessing that in russia, they did that to be known in that region
well not really bad , more wrong...
JT: song about clopping?
Eeyup
Pearly: Yeah, and to make us, who don't want to play russian version, to pay more
But that is my guess
I don't think I'm allowed to send YT links do

Uhm well its well
uhm
You can
Okay
Its not that wrong
brb

try this
Registration Code: 5397-489611
Bladed I'm just stupid today ^^
the name is "TST User"
Serenity: we could use the B.S. server right?

Serenity: if it doesnt work i'll see it Shizuka's server is still going
Serenity , Junker just needed some friends :P
Hmmm...

Vordox: Never heard it
JunkerKun: You must be younger then 19 :P
Wow, seriously? I grew up with this song. O_o
because if his friends don't wave and if they don't wave, then they're no friends of mine
Vordox: Nope, I'm 20
/me does the safety dance
Vordox: I'm Russian =)
JunkerKun: D: And you never saw Batman Forever?!

Ohai SafariMonkey!
Hi MadSurge
hi
did anyone here play Double Dragon Neo or knows Jake Kaufmann aka virt ?
No
What is Double Dragon Neo? Never heard of it
*Family
JunkerKun appearently an official remake of Double Dragon (NES)
Lil_B: Oh.
Ugggghhh, I can't get past the damn tentacles in Black Mesa. T^T
Gold_Demona: Throw grenades away from you
I do. They come back immediately
Then they will attack the grenades when they explode
And crouch/walking doesn't help
Don't run, crouch
It doesn't work
They come back before I even get to the ladder
Wait for the grenade to explode, wait a few moments for them to start going, then crouchwalk
Once they calm down a bit, throw another
hehe http://ask-thecrusaders.tumblr.com/post/31852055670/nope
... Black Meso ... Iguess there IS something I can do to waste some time :)
Black Mesa* ... I was not talking about a Soup

Something tells me I'm never getting past this part...

body swap?
why?
dunno
how would you even write for that?
It's funny because most of that stuff actually happened in season 2. :D
Dken2021 magic
Bronysith whos the guy with derpy
Dken2021 thats how they explaibned time travel XD
the spike episode was meh
like expected
as? as.
well I mean like a plot point for a children's show
I actully kind of liked it.
hi
Hi, LindsyaThePony :)
lali-ho LindsyaThePony
I need to watch most of the episodes several times to like them
hi LindsyaThePony
they don't carry this innocent season 1 atmosphere anymore
hey
hi
hi
have to go for now, bbl
hm...
episodes without twilight sparkle
can't be good by definition
Family Appreciation day?
hia lindsey
Sisterhooves Social?
how are you LindsyaThePony
I'd go for a Big Mac episode, or Rainbow Dash's secret
hia LindsyaThePony *
hi
Those episodes didn't have Twilight in them.
DaringDerpy sister hooves social
im good :$
I loved that Spike episode
Hello LindsyaThePony
huh, there's should be another category that's needed in that bingo, like episode of AJ on her own
Applejack2011: ^
I don't like the cmc either ^^
I wanna see the Scootaloo episode Lauren talked about and something involving changelings
me too LilB
aj had a role in the derpy episode ^^
^
Lil_B what was the scootaloo episode supposed to be about?
^
is it just me or did 7 people just wrote something at the same time?
idc about scootaloo I WANT AN APPLEJACK SONG
alright cys
cya
it was you
Want AJ song too
oj its just my chat XD
True, but Scootaloo has NO development ata ll.
* at all
Besides being a young RD.
Lauren said that she wanted to make a episode for her, but so far it hasn't been done, but she has a background
Lil_B: I know. I hope that happens, though.
Hope that other episod with RD and AJ happens, too.
AJIsAwesome: there's still chance for that to happen in season 3 :D
alexxm scootaloo is not supposed to fly and Lauren said she wanted to make a episode where she has to face the fact that she will never reach this goal
huh that seems depressing
strong stuff
alexxm I know I don't know if Hasbro will be ok with that
alexxm: Depressing, yes. But it's a very strong lesson as well.
I wonder how they want to present this to the kids
or how she wants to do it
DaringDerpy Lauren want, but it's questionable if Hasbro will let this happen
Hope for AJ and Fluttershy together
episode
hasbro will let it happen if the script is good
traumatizing 4yo kids is not an option
no idea how to do it
but I'm no scriptwriter
trees...
haha
I wanna see an grown up episode, lke the flashback episode from S1
Not me.
like a flashfoward episode?
yes
me tooLil
¨lil
I'm nt sure if i want that to happen.
It would be interesting, though.
it sounds like an ok episode t odo if they have no plans for more seasons
afaik, they have plans
I want one ever sicne I saw a a perticular picture... wait
If MLP: FIM does end, I hope they would do 5 minute shorts like they did with Foster's.
anybody here?
Yo yo yo!
*If the main series ends*
6I am but I have to go now.. >.<
the show is a major success. there is no reason to end it before it gets bad
back
so I drive by this truck that advertises "we clean anything"
DaringDerpy: I know that. I'm just saying when it does.
one of the things listed is "crime scenes"
g5 is a risk...new team, new concept, everything can go wrong.
Hello everyone.
menwhirl
I am half tempted to call them up and be like "so I've got this dead body, can you help?"

hi Meanwhile
Hi, Meanwhile :)
good evening
Hey Meanwhile

Suppose I should add that to my pings.

Just waiting to ban someone.

Ban me for 0.2 seconds

Dabi, once more so I can check please?

Dken2021 to be honest, at some points the actual good Ideas are drawn out after 100 episodes if you don't have a continuing storyline

spadermen.mpeg
aww :(
hi tiara :)
ohey dabi

Dken2021 I know, but it would still be a growing challenge to make creative well-written episodes after you already made so many
hi Tiara
ello Tiara
6See ya..
hiu
hi
btw... has anyone here already played Borderlands 2?
NOPE.AVI
It's not out here
Hello Tiara
they made a Arrow(Bullet) to the Knee Joke ...
an*
:)
an*
In the knee*
/me doesn't have any of the cool games except TF2 because money
Isn't that joke already overused?
Serenity the meme say to the knee
The quote says in the knee
says "to the knee" *
just as old as Fluttertree jokes
wait a sec... why do I even care how the quote actually goes?
Lil_B: but I heard there's a guy that talks a lot about... horses :D
AJIsAwesome thats the point, and they still made that joke -.-
:I
horse jokes :D
MadSurge I also heard another thing, but I had to find the video and the point in the video again to find it :/
Jesus
it's like beating a ...hey!
What?
I heard there's a guy who will make your horse into glue and canned dog food for good money.
My old laptop has an AMD Turion processor single core
:(
really Meanwhile this soon
>September already?
Meanwhile: really? :D
Fucking Tesco
Meanwhile: Cinderblock them and demand they put out the Halloween shit
Yup. That's a record I think, usually they have it out on Halloween.
It's still Halloween time!
our mall has Xmas decoration for sale now :D
Tesco are so early
Always are
Lil_B: candy has no season :D
No....
I always buy a crap ton of candy corn and scarf it down. :D
Actually, MadSurge, candy canes are usually Chrimbo themed
why is this stuff coming out sooner every year
The Walmart where I live and the one 5 minutes from school had winter coats and jackets on the shelves.
Lil_B: that might be the case :D
THE VERY LAST WEEK OF FUCKING AUGUST
alexxm "We got to have... money" - owner of the shop
Is anything streaming right now, or did my browser crash again?
don't think so
no stream
Don't think anyone has streamed since Phase this morning
Serenity: candy canes? It's been a million years since I had something like that or a giant lollipop :Q
I had a giant lolly the other week at Scotland, but haven't had a candy cane in years
unusual quiet stream today
and halfdead chat
Applejack2011: well, no stream means no sound :D
:D
http://i.imgur.com/J0lB6.jpg

Wait a minute is it wednesday?

Aww I thought it was Thursday. Dafuq is this.
It's a chatroom. :P
>mfw robbers broke in this place last night

14did they steal anything?
/me clutches stomach "ow, right in the childhood"
Yes
MadSurge: I KNOW, RIGHT?

Rainbow_Dash_Rocks the Childhood of various people
http://i.imgur.com/LPZQf.jpg <- I found this funnier than I should have
PillowPoni: :O
MadSurge: I don't think they'd show that on stream. But then again we watch South Park here so....
Rainbow_Dash_Rocks: the Hungry Caterpillar!
PillowPoni: that's my reasoning
I remember this
Ages ago
Rainbow_Dash_Rocks have you not read books when you where little?
Damn, the years have flown by
AJIsAwesome_: What is Pingu? I don't think I've seen it.....
Mmm all this fruit
It's a babies show about a penguin
It is cracking
MadSurge: True but DT is a little more vulgar than South Park....
Hmm
Mebbe
I AM THE CHEESE
cupcake
PillowPoni: Scoots streams Boondocks
Is it worse than that?
AJIsAwesome: I AM THE BEST CHARACTER ON THE SHOW
I AM THE BEST CHARACTER ON THE SHOW
I've never seen Pingu. I don't remember hearing about it, either *braces pitchforks*
i watched pingu as a kid
I AM BETTER THAN THE BOLOGNA AND THE SALAMI COMBINED!
Boondocks isn't that bad
Compared to some of the stuff out there
compared to boondocks, it makes boondocks look like lucky stars
And then he became a butterfly :3
I hope I'm there when scoots streams the second Pokemon Movie
Lil_B: too late

Mozdoc: tower defense, basically.
Mozdoc: yeah, like a defense game
Bye ya' all ^_^
So where are the enemies trying to get to?
concentrated friendship
Mozdoc: There's a place at the back of the map where they drop a bomb in.
You have to protect that part of the map.
What's the name of this song? It's groovy
Mozdoc: a point where there's basically a payload hole
:D Nice poster Shizu
if it exists, there are fanboys surrounding it
it's a law of nature
or force of nature, I dunno
I wonder if she likes Evangelion
/me shot
Both
Looting like a pro
MadSurge: Pretty sure she does. :D
I'm kind of having a hard time imagining that Shizuka is a girl and plays this welll or likes games this much...
Well you better believe it. :D
Mozdoc: Why's that hard to understand?
Mozdoc: HURR DURR CHICKS NO LIKE GAMES
Lies! there are no girls on the internet!

Alchemist: Battlefield Heroes was amazing during beta. Now it's just another shitty Pay2Win game.
XAX: battlefield play4free is the same. Level one players with overpowered level 25 weapons running around.
Gnight everypony HF!
is that a mashup i hear
lol quad city djs
night Michael
XAX: But I dont really mind it. It allows me to have a quick 15-30 minutes of fun and the average player is still terrible, OP weapon or not.
Lol.
I had that game during beta as well. Got the beta beret D: Might redownload it.
13brb
Now they are having daily draws where you get a random item for a random time. You can even get a weapon permanently, but so far I only got crappy clothes/accessories for 1-2 days :D
Pony up, boys1

Can anyone tell me what the Saxton Hale game was?
Wasn't that from a couple years ago/
Or was it a mod?

One of the voice clips I've heard is this guy shouting "Saxton HAAAAAAALLLLLLEEEE!" or something like that.
Saxton Hale is manliest man
Wasn't there an in-game model based off Saxton Hale?

welcome back OvergrownPegasus411 :)
CrimsonPhoenix i only recently got the internet in my new place
:O that shipping
Yay!
:P
Chrysalis, I'm sorry but how is that relevent to what I said?
And the last time I was here I discovered.... don't hug me I'm scared
So. Much. Feels.
it was just a picture without any links though, should be safe
killerpony7733, you think Wrek is scared of that?
right, wrong person in reference
yeah alexs had a long period without uploading any new stuff
CrimsonPhoenix No? i know he knows but i just kinda said it so people would know if they are curious and may have ended up pressing some tags
I am gonna be on Pinki'es HYperactive chat
damn timeouts
killerpony7733, I don't see tab when it's only the pics
bbl guys, got some work to do
unless someone is really curious and delete the picture part of the url then a warning may be valid
so, have you guys read Cheerilee's Garden?
CrimsonPhoenix Well i do so idunno
OH GOD
YES. YES I DID
i loved it
:(
killerpony7733, intriguing
No, but I know what it's about.
its surprisingly well written, considering its a gorefic
also, the deaths are pretty creative
*cough* read the damn rules *cough*
And chat is ded?
Nvm.
Rules, my friend.
hey, im not discussing the deaths in great detail, so, im fine

How many of you would be interested if I started a movie stream tonight? Just for fun?
alot of chat today >_>
what movie
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lz7VHgSIhSM
The Andromeda Strain
tumbleweeds. THEY'RE REAL
I just need to figure out how to do it.
aww, it;s a tumbleweed couple <3
Only catch is that it wouldn't have its own IRC channel, so if we wanted to chat, we'd probably have to open up the stream in a another tab while using this chat channel to talk.

we should try to write the most disturbing fic ever.
Came here to check the chat
flutter_spin: Reading the synopsis. Seems very interesting.
why isn't it showing the picture?
https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/9/17/Z-d83MTbKkuCao1UPfua9A2.jpg
Yeah, no FlutterDash.
I don't like horror. Scary, tense, but no gory horror
Good buy and always, SUCK A MY SUCK A MY SUCK A MY SCHLONG guys.
bye*
..............
gore isnt horror. its just gore
it is for me
That's the wallpaper I was talking about.
hey awesome i love that pose ^^
.-.
and its an awesome pic
perfect for the phone :)
Well, that was............interesting. :S
V/H/S Sounds aweeeesooooooooooomeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.
can you post it one more time for my phone :]
I don't know. I'm very sensitive on horror.
Or you know what, I'll review this fic that got dumped in chat.
Hi bronies/ponies! :)
flutter_spin: Are you still working on it?

Hi, Pikachu! :)
ello Pikachu
someone getting brutally murded, or gutted, isnt horror.
Have fun, hope it's a good one.
hi Pikachu
flutter_spin: Okay.
Let's see here...Itunes classics...
Hm
'Splice' Aliens Vs. PRedator.
PLease dont tell me you were watching 'Cupcakes' I am totally scared of that
Cupcakes is tame
The Thing
Cupcakes is... tame?
yeah
It's far less painful than the grammatically-challenged messes I usually end up with.
Not to me.
also, it wasnt even a good fic
its badly written
careful guys
Childs Play
Really, compared to the last thing I decided to force myself to read, the rampant abuse of a thesaurus is almost pleasant..
i like my little dashie\
I don't even like Bubbles
My Little Dashie bored me
THEM!
got it
Bubbles was sad
THE earth Dies SCreaming!
Here's a classic: Laserblast
i think ive heard of Laserblast
At one time, even Starcraft scared me
Mst3k
depends on what version of cupcakes
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Becomin' Popularrr
there were several revisions
dude, i read A Fun Day, Cheerilee's Garden, Cupcakes, Rarity's New Dress, Sweet Apple Massacre, etc, and did not get disturbed
some just hopelessy overdid the gore
Drf
but the last one i read (quite a while ago. a long while was actually pretty good
which is
You know what my dog does when he misses me? He just runs out the door and pees everywhere .-.
Can't tell if you are proud of not being disturbed
Okies guy, gotta go to bed now. See you tomorrow!
SAM disturbed me.
sweet apple massacre was just a typical case of "tried too hard"
hey Nit
Nitt, if it didn't, I would be disturbed by /you/
Hey flutter_spin.
so does ours
Cupcakes didn't.
SAM was bad, but a funny bad
but only when it's my mom
she hates all the rest of us LOL
Cheerilee's Garden didn't.
What's that movie with the japanese gal who climbs out of the TV/
I didn't like SAM
Ring?
Oh yeaaaah
That was too disturbing
2,14 and we're live folks
SAM was hilarious
HUZZAAAH
FlutterDash: what is SAM? (Cue song)
The first of those...okay, admittedly, Cupcakes probably just gets annoying after a while. The second? I'm not even going to ask, Nitt.
2,14 this video represents today's theme for the stream
Which is?
there we go...stream!
and yes, im proud that nothing disturbs me
spiderman
?
i think i know
Sweet Apple Massacre
SUDDENLY STREAM
SPIDERMAN DOES WHAT HE WANTS
Oh, yes.
dat Caramel stream
so today is a spiderman theme stream? :)
Caramel does what he wants lol
uh oh caramel i do what i want stream
things are going to go awesome
'tis an ill omen
dark, what song?
inb4 g3.6 ponies
I smell a golden candy
KandARRRRRRRRRRRRihu: aye, matey
Val once again demonstrates all of the fucks he gives for chat's whining.
FlutterDash: Song from the video?
http://imgur.com/GKZco.jpg
OMG
There are cupcakes sequels worse than the original.
Sudently
not sure if GIANT dog, tiny baby, or both
oh this vid :)
oh hey
I was watching tobuscus play slender and then this started playing at the perfect time I thought it was the video
0
that now overplayed video
Precisely. And I approve.
and i smell Caramel
/me glomps Chrysalis
thats pretty awesome
Chrysalis: why is laguna so awesome?
But I guess that wallpaper isnt public?
Bronysith because ff8
someone said "whats SAM?(Cue Song)"
you cannot ignore its girth
I'm sensing german
2,14 bronysith: BECAUSE GREATEST ATTACK EVER!
Nittany_Discord, aren't cupcakes sequels basically tryhards of the original?
For some reason, I instantly thought Rammstein
Cupcakes was a tryhard as well
no it is, its just a zip file because there's a bunch of different sizes and colors
FlutterDash, good point
Luna be best pony
flutter_spin: same
G'night everypony! :)
Luna is best princess
Cheerilee's Garden was really good though
nite GilDash
Some are.
night GilDash
Caramel: well i still need to play more ff8
Night GilDash
night GilDash
I enjoy Rainbow Factory myself
'night GilDash
night GilDash
havent read Rainbow Factory. well, i read a riff fic on it
Night, GilDash :)
night GilDash
I don't know whether to watch this, watch Dr. Who, play Starcraft 2, or write some more of my story. No, I will not do all at once.
it looks like a bass octavia is playing but I've been told it was a cello I'm confused
flutter_spin, where are you on Dr Who?
flutter_spin: Yes.
I watched Season 6, went back and watched Season 5. I watched the first episodes of Season 1
season 1 or the first series?
woah wait wha
of the 9th doctor
fluffy pony
so you started on 11th doctor?
yes
I watched all of 11th doctor
awww yea batman!!
cause there was docters 1-8, then 9-11
dude that's like.....
why
no way
yes!
needs more adam west
lol derpy
lol no no no no. Doctors 1-8 is not on my todo list
I started at 9th to 10
haven't watched 11 yet
why not
and I'm thinking on watching the oldies
before 11
if youre a fan of a series, you should know where the series came from
Well you are a curious person. I would rather read all of Lord of the Rings books before watching Doctors 1-8
ty
But some of the old episodes are lost, right?
batman!!!
05im old enough to have watched this, yay
And trust me, those books were on my list for a long time
flutter_spin, who's the most important companion?
Same here.
most important? Well the only ones I really know are Amy & Rory
so, you wont even give the old docters a chance, because theyre old?
because, police blimps
I have to draw the line somewhere.
np
thats a shallow reason
oh manbat ep cool
every doctor has thier plusses and minuses
I believe Sarah Jane Smith is THE most iconic companion
SUNDAY SUNDAY SUNDAY
awesome thanks
BE THERE
ive never watched Docter Who. if i decide to start, ill start from First Docter
so
Look. I have been dying to see the 9th and 10th doctor. A special episode suddenly wants me to see the 5th doctor.
whats on sunday?
we have a VA, playing a rent-a-cop, wanting to be a VA
FlutterDash: have fun finding old episodes
how ironic
FlutterDash, to be honest I'll say it's safe to start on 9th
But no, I don't have 'all the time in the world' to do everything
wait............is this............BATMAN?
Dark92Enigma, yes
>Giant bat
nah. i wanna start from the beginning
no the manbat
We're past the intro, right?
>Obviously Batman
Do you know how many episodes there are before the reboot?
FlutterDash, enjoy you're missing episodes
anytime :P
2 face?
CrimsonPhoenix: *your
Bronysith, thank you
im awae that theres alot of episodes befoe the reoot
I hate that common mistake
reboot*
flutter_spin: I heard there were over ten seasons
I've also heard that there are missing episodes of the 1st & 2nd
i was in the bathroom, and when i got back, i'm watching this!
aware*
YESYESYESYES
most of 2nd
Meanwhile: http://i.imgur.com/s3KJK.png
12!pokemon
and 1st only in season 4
Soital, you are a 3Haxorus.
lol alfred
weeping_pegasi82: yeah. When I looked at it, I just wanted to settle with the 11th doctor. Then, slowly, I wanted to see the 9th & 10th
If anything, it was for the episode: "Blink"
as i said, i like to start from the beginning
Tennant is best doctor
Jim: I agree
Tennant is the 10th doctor, correct? Jim, I hear that from everyone
I looked at the first Story-arc of Dr. Who.........from then onwards, i carried on
yup
yeah, he's #10
HELLO
oh my
dr who is like MLP, everyone has thier favorite doctor for different reasaons
Oh, mai............
HE'S BATMAN
oh old cartoons
Oh myyyyyyyy
it's just that 10th had more exposure thus he's more popular
mfw turn on stream and BATMAN
Right now, I dislike the 9th doctor. I find him kind of cold.
and he was funnier
flutter_spin: don't worry he warms up to you
WHO IS STREAMING, AND WHERE CAN I SEND MY HUGS
:D
CK|Catnap: Caramel IS.
weeping_pegasi82: I hope so.
flutter_spin: kinda like.......emo?
9th had great xpression
expression**
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lelhg6hPm41qb9lkbo1_400.jpg
CK|Catnap: Caramel
I can't read this D:
All the hugs, Caramel. ALL OF THEM. :3
Dark92Enigma: hmm. Not exactly. Just seems a little cold-hearted, cruel perhaps? not caring.
i don't think the 9th doctor was that bad
i myself like Jon Pertwee as a favorite myself
and I love the 9th when he gets all serious or raging
3rd doctor
though thees this webcomic called Homestuck, thats over 6000 pages, and still going. a few of my friends are really into it, and have told me again and again to read it. i will, someday
theres
A microscopic twig!
hmmm
!puellamagi
the 9th doctor's grin is just ear to ear!
Jinkies!
FlutterDash, DON'T
Skylands, you are 121Homura Akemi.
Its been so many years since Ive read music
I don't either, but I think it's safe to assume it's an insult of some kind :p
!pokemon
Nick, you are a 14Leavanny.
I like that its original
why not
....LOL, they actually have that "hut-hut-hut" sound?
same haha
I wanna know what it says ;__; xD
12hai Nick :3
That's like golden stereotype
Homestuck is horrible
hi blueflare!
and overshadows a lot of MSPA comics
I have to find out what it means now :p
Our designated dishwasher would tell stories of proper Navy & Marine procedures
like which people say 'hoorah'
as i said, i might read it someday. though that means ill most likely never read it
batmans got to be pretty strong to pull apart elevator doors, that's usually a two man job
That's an empty threat, just go ahead and call them off yourself, Gordon.
6,000 pages is alot
Herp derp.
....
coooooool
you idiot
Tear gas, now with explodium
tear gas sets off certain chemicals that's why you never use it on a meth lab
lol bat exhibit
QUESTION
If i'm NOT wrong..........this show is on THE HUB right?
You wanna know what it says? :p
what exactly IS Homestuck about?
yeah
Why does BATMAN, need to learn about BATS
Yes 8)
I wont kick you if its a bad word :P
You are a babe :p
I thought he knew a lot about bats as it was
xD
lol
He reminds me of the penguin
lol
haha
Where'd you find it lol
ah yeah
and ill most likely not watch Doctor Who either. theres other shows to watch
lol.
Wayne is good at pretending to be dumb.
again, i'll ask: this show is on The Hub, right?
O.o
and that does not worry you?
interesting noise
lik,e ever watch Madoka Magica?
I don't know if it is on the Hub. They might have the other Batman show.
Yeah, no bat makes a noise like that.
Dat burn, Alfred
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: More Shirts at Welovefine
weeping_pegasi82: i heard it in Disney's Hercules
...fuck you alfred. fuck you
Dark92Enigma: Yes.
What's Up Doc?
Dark__Horst: Umad bro? Alfred be trollin
LOL
lol
I'm confused. Is his batman voice more natural?
Ah... This one. The first episode ever to be broadcast.
Madoka Magica is the typical magical girl anime, but is very different from the others
cant say cause spoilers
ken, first episode of what
dc issue, FD?
Batman, the animated series.
flutter_spin: All the Batman shows i know are: THIS ONE <-- Batman Beyond, The Batman reboot, and the Brave and Bold...........the hub mentions Batman: The Animated Series
ah. and yeah, server crapped out.
lol. I hate when that happens
lol at demonik
Batman the Animated Series. ive seen one episode, which was Baby Doll. dark stuff.
Hi everypony=D
FlutterDash_ It's kinda hard, because you can't tell if it's the beginning, so i can't tell you ''WELL DUH''
hey cachi01|phone
so the lizard as a bat?
hi cachi01|phone
WWWWWWWWWHAT A TWEEEEEST?
Remember her? 8)
Hi cachi01|phone!
hi cachi01|phone
cachi01|phone: guess what's on the stream?
uhhh no :P
Well Dark92Enigma, I guess it is. I don't pay attention to what is on the Hub. If there is a show I like, I watch just the one show
hi weeping_pegasi82 BladedWings Dark92Enigma and AJIsAwesome :)
dammit shibaru
Dark92Enigma, mmmmmm batman?
hi cachi01|phone
stay out of shadowarrow's shed
no manbat
hi thelonepony :)
Oh
WAIT IS IT REALLY BATMAN?
Hey guys Im ba- HOLY CRAP are we watching Batman TAS?
ah, the dark knight rises
Obsidian: eeyup
Blech, all these EQD links.
The ghost is speaking to us. It says ooooooooo
flutter_spin: we-know-who!........IF I WOULD have the Hub in my country, i would watch this show again
THE Cooommiiishiner
Deeeeeeaaaaaaaad.
Trick me into thinking this room is anything but dead.
cachi01|phone: the ANIMATED SERIES
The ghost is speaking. It says *explodes*
BATMAN TAS? BRB GETTING ICE CREAM AND TURNING PS3 ON!
There we are.
Dark92Enigma: aw. I've seen this on several other channels.
She was that other person on that join.me that one time when I was playing LSD XD
heres the basic premise. This girl named Madoka, and her friend Sayaka are approached by this creature called Kyube, who says that if they make a contract ith him, they ecome magical girls, and he grants them one wish.
DA COMMISSIONER!!!!!
Gaahahahahahh!
with*
Its one of those shows that sneak in every now and then
flutter_spin: i can't tell.....i'm not in the US
I loved this show as a kid
demonik or shadow?
demonik
haha
I believe it aired on Cartoon Network for some time
lol, becomin' popularrr
bthere. thats the basic premise
Derp
HOLY----
cartoon network, fox kids and WBkids
blood
DED
yeah. WB. I don't get WB
Yeah i remember her
Alfred gives no fucks.
I had to watch... um, Xmen Kids whatever on the Internet. Stupid WB
alfred never gives a fuck
ALfred sees giant bat. Asks if it wants dinner.
He's too classy to give fucks
WB does not broadcast things like this anymore in my country..........
WHY?
>Will he change again?
>It's over....for now
No spoilers
EPIC
I think the implication was that he could do it again if he wanted to
Simply epic
Madoka Magica is a really good show. that simple premise actually gets expanded upon
i have a batman vs predator comic and alfred is so badass in it
haha. Batmare
B:tAS is shown on the HUB, these days.
Here we go again
"batmare" :D
I think that was what they were going for, Meanwhile, it just sorta feels awkward. XD
cachi01|phone: I have that one
Batmare :D
I now miss Darkwing Duck
brb
:3
Yeah I get what you mean Critic, it's a bit..."what?"
Caramel next time play Batman feat. Nostalgia Critic
if only that episode wasn't so uhhhhhh... how do I say it?
Dat lightning
Dat lightning. :D
now for the overplayed episode
bad, maybe?
I love tortelini so much I don't even know how to spell it

2,14 I nominate Mark Hamill for one of the top 5 VAs of all time
Caramel, agreed
"Could never get past the title; could never imagine how anyone could have a wonderful life"
maybe even top 1
agreed
Caramel: he is also luke skywalker
Tabitha being /2
Agreed
#2**
i heard the version of Dark Knight Rises they showed in Colorado was the directors cut.it had 12 shots not in the original
Bronysith: everyone knows that
FlutterDash no it didn't
no, its a joke. 12 shots. 12 people died
FlutterDash: HORRIBLE.
2,14 Bronysith: already knew that
Spreading the friendship
...And thats....awful
That is a truly awful thing to say
Mark Hamill is just so damn good. And he's been in a lot of great stuff, too. Voice of Batman TAS's Joker, played the lead role in Wing Commander....
2,14 I only say top 5 because it's near impossible to say who's the best ever
whats REALLY awful is that those people never saw the end of the movie
2,14 I mean, there's Tabitha and Tara to consider :P
Anybody know how to use torrents?
"Relentelessy Cheerful -3-?"
Nope
Caramel: Don't forget Jim Cummings
Critic: Firelord Ozai.
Ask Mike 8)
I'm sorry but Tabitha is clearly superior to Tara
more oldschool cartoons?
I use to use it a long time ago
Tara Strong is my fav voice actress...
Instead, we has JOKER TROLLING
Comedy is Comedy. no matter how offensive it is
CrimsonPhoenix Tabith is best VA :)
it's true
joker you troll
comedy is comedy
This is hardly oldschool.
But we are watching Batman. :P
Joker is a TROLOLOLOLOLOLOLO
http://leteckaposta.cz/387348817
Kencolt, hasn't this show been in the 90s?
TITLE DROP!
we're in the 10's now
i think frank welker wins just check his imdb page
Apparently this is a really rare wallpaper
that sweater
CrimsonPhoenix: I'm in my mid-fiffties. As far as I am concerned, this is far from old school.
Depends on your definition of old school.
2ND TITLE DRO
´DROP*
Kencolt, oh dear
You can tell the crowd is acting all wooden!
Hitting 55 come november.
:D
get it?
Fourteen people shot dead at Dark Knight Rises premier? Here's betting at least one of the orphans becomes the real Batman.
Dem cutouts
*facehoof*
Dark92Enigma: Boo............
dat laugh track
:| Everyone's a critic
FlutterDash: Double boo
>can't spit out the candy cane gag
Wow this is the best website I've found...
>nothing holding it in
/me pats Dark92Enigma "It's okay."
Man, Joker's voice sounds wayyyy different
A gunman has opened fire at a screening of "The Dark Knight Rises" in Colorado killing 12 people and injuring 50 others. What saddens me the most is that why couldn't he prepare to wait another 4 months for a screening of Twilight: Breaking Dawn....
FlutterDash: and i thought my joke was lame......that's no laughing matter
jojoyasmin, http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2637/
its really tasty i guess
Deadlypon3: Probably because of Hamill getting older
Flutterdash Do Not joke about it
THats enough FlutterDash
FlutterDash: I lold.
FlutterDash: you're getting a ban
Haha wow
JESmith71 he has voiced it for YEARS; He doesn't sound different even in the last year Arkham
wow
an exe? that's odd
ban for telling jokes?
ok then
Ah leave him alone you crybabies.
Joker. Brilliant homicidal madman. Worst ventriloquist ever.
Flutterdash Not when you live in colorado
Well you said he sounded different
hey, as i said. comedy is comedy
Dat song
Flutterdash no it's NOT
FlutterDash: No......ban for joking with a TERRIBLE INCIDENT THAT IS NOT LAUGHING MATTER
that's were it came from
Ooh, Batman.
Hey you could say that's Joker's right hand mand
dat song :D
man
JESmith71: lawl
WHAT?!?!!?
hey, i make jokes about stuff like that all the time
SEE, THAT'S A FUNNY JOKE
FlutterDash, you haven't been banned
download it right now :p
WAIT
UR MOM
I'm suprised that didn't use that joke in the real episode
You should be real careful if its an actual program
Oh noes! Her mommy!
YOUR MOMMA
Flutterdash then your an awful person. let's just drop it...
shoo be doo
it be an exe in a zip file
i am. i am an awful person. thank you for the compliment
nah its all good, it was on spyroforum
Call upon the snow ponies, they'll save the day.
Well...I live in colorado, dude.
http://www.spyroforum.com/topic-12861-lost-dawn-of-the-dragon-screensaver.html
I take it seriously.
cool. youre lucky you didnt go to that showing
I still have this little Batman action figure based on this series.........and proud of it......
seems to run fine in WINE, pretty neat
Flutterdash just drop it
EqD used Wrek's pirate Rarity picture for that "Becoming Popularrr" post. Nice.
THOMAS NOOOOOOOO
Dark92Enigma: I wish I saw the Adam West series as a kid. :D
DIESEL NOOOOOOOOOOO
also, i have a friend who lives in new york, and he finds 9/11 jokes funny
*sigh* The good 'ol days, Batman, Animaniacs, Tiny Toons, Freakazoid...
VenHur: Yep. :(
AJIsAwesome: I did
Flutterdash Good for him.
wine?
Dark92Enigma: lucky. :D
g2g guys cya in 2 days =D
Nowadays, I only watch TV for The 90s Are All That, Toonami, and Ponies...
AJIsAwesome: Adam West actually did a guest voice for an episode of this show
He did?
Oh no........POP goes the crowd!
Crap, stopped watching for a little and turned to train explosions
Cool.
Yeah :O
get it?
Dark92Enigma: .............
AJIsAwesome: I was introduced to Batman through Adam West. I think before the Keaton film came out Family Channel started playing the West Batman
Its a program like Microsoft Windows
Dat face
ooh, neat
OH SHIT!
and a few family members of his died in9/11 as well. if he can take a joke, why cant thou?
AJIsAwesome: Yeah West played the Grey Ghost
program for linux to run windows programs using non proprietary methods :)
oh ok
http://derpy.me/es3Vd
Is the screensaver actually decent?
....
Mortar
I think so :p
He turned an observatory into a bloody mortar cannon
Oh yeah, and that block for the 90s Cartoon Network cartoons...forgot what it called...
XD
Spooonsor :O
Dat Fourth Wall Break
....that was meta
AJIsAwesome: Dammit, play the filler Johhny
VenHur: Cartoon Cartoons?
4TH WALL BREAK
Flutterdash Just drop it
VenHur: Cartoon Cartoon Friday or Toonami?
Dark92Enigma: My name's not Johnny, sir. :(
13http://i.imgur.com/ZPijh.jpg i want one
Joker doesn't acknowledge your silly walls :|
spyro and cynder are rather small but it's pretty neat
No, no..the block that have Space Ghost, not coast to coast though...
Shizuka: D'aaaaaaw
besides, i make fun of everything. religion, tragedies, etc. everythings fair game
Pretty, Shizu :o
So commish the artist Shizu.

http://www.dorkly.com/comic/44205/nerf-now-black-mesa
Can you have animated wallpapers?
and now im done
Then...well, you're doomed.
VenHur: Cartoon Planet?
It's so sweet and disturbing at the same time. :D
Machine gun fingers.
JESmith71: no, that's new.
...couldn't yah just crawl under them?
Though that wasn't a block it was a show
JESmith71: That was added months ago.
AJIsAwesome: when i do a lame joke, i tell johnny (the piano man) to play the following clip (cue PM)
For when your machine guns aren't inaccurate or impractical enough
Oh yeah, Cartoon Planet...that block camed back, but Space Ghost didn't comed back.
AJIsAwesome: It's not new, it's a revival of an old show
Dark92Enigma: OH, now I gte it. I couldn't tell what you're talking about.
Bewm
JESmith71: It is? I thought all they did was air old cartoons.
BOOM
The suspect being held for the Dark Knight Rises killings in Colorado is almost certainly going to be found guilty for his terrible crime... ...I guess that rules out him being member of the Metropolitan Police
That block has some Cartoon Cartoons from the 90s.

pooper
12Out of all the packages I bought this month
12the only one annoying person is one on ebay
A BOMB?
Betty Blooper :3!
BETTY BLOOPER :D
W_Wait?
That's nice
http://cheezburger.com/6589191936 ohgod
betty blooper?
AJIsAwesome: Yeah Cartoon Planet first started in 1995 on TBS and moved to CN and ran through 1997
So Joker is a betty Blooper fan?
wan't this on stream a while ago?
JESmith71: Oh, didn't know that. Thanks.
XylemTube: Yep
FlutterDash: Could be worse, you could be doing 9/11 jokes. Thos're just plane wrong.
XylemTube, many times
XylemTube: Yeah, a couple weeks ago.
It has a giant clown face on it; so it is obviously a hideout for joker.
XD nice one
Great episode here
Sumi ran it recently after the Batman film played
Bronysith: i think youll be delighted to know that bieber is going to do a cover of stairway to heaven
what do you mean lati?
Referencing Betty Boop, a true oldschool cartoon character of the 30's.
Joker is so happy :P
that laugh!
pirate_sprinkle, WHAT
NO
Tell me you're lying
SPEAKEERS, BATMAN!
Bieber. DOING. A COVER. OF STAIRWAY? FFFFUUUUUUUUUU!
NUTCRACKER!!!!!!
I probably can't stream again today
Dark92Enigma Batman should destroy any building with a clown face on it
pirate_sprinkle, You must be trolling
Time to dance
pirate_sprinkle: okay there is trolling, then there is going way too far
CrimsonPhoenix: unfortunately im not. apparently raping hey jude and let it be wasnt enought
holy nutcracker batman!
I should be getting some sleep before school.
im not trolling, google it.
2,14 fuck the stream rules dari, queue up again
pirate_sprinkle: Wait, what?!
13http://i.imgur.com/kaJUQ.jpg
HOOOOOOOOME-RUUUUUUUUN
pirate_sprinkle: He sang hey jude and let it be? :S
Shizuka: Ahahaha
Shizuka: :D
and now...STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN!?
pirate_sprinkle: isn't talking about rape inhere against the rules? o.o
They don't call him Batman for nothing...oh wait
Snoipahs?
What was the last thing to go through Mr Jone's head while he was working on the 90th floor of the WTC?
AJIsAwesome: i believe so. i know i saw him butcher hey jude on crhistmas, ive also heard that he covered let it be
the 91st floor.
Shizuka: That is so me. :D Okay, so it's not, but being a kitty I could totally see me doing that.
Derpy_Hooves: its a figure of speech and neither is it a joke
Nickelodeon has The 90s are All That. Cartoon Network has Cartoon Planet.
"I Love you Berry much"
....Pedobear
pirate_sprinkle: ..........................this doesn't even deserve a facehoof.
BEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAR
nice to see that saftey is a priority here
As for Disney...well, nothing...
How is eucharist like a dick? You get them both shoved down your throat by a priest.
pirate_sprinkle: stairway to heaven is sacred territory, not even the greatest bands in the world are allowed to cover that
Hah.
And....
LOL
VenHur: Yeah it sucks they took away the old school stuff from Toon Disney
Bronysith: well let it be was sacred territory too
:D
Dat Lambduh
I don't get the joke
if that had been poison, he
POW right in the kisser
No one expects the Pie Inquisition

Loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong time no see

LOL
POINTLESS....................but fun

DROP HIM!
pirate_sprinkle: but this is stairway to heaven, the greatest rock song ever
Thanks god this amazing cartoon is on The Hub.
that sure was nice of the batman
VenHur: I knew it
Baah hum bug
VenHur and also batman beyond
Why would you ever need fake arms like that anyways? XD
I mena more specifically what happened?
pirate_sprinkle: no one should cover classic rock...like, ever
It's so one-use it's hilarious
EVER
CK Catnap Caaause it's joker
2,14 alright flutterdash, you've had your fun
NEVER COVER CLASSIC ROCK
2,14 now knock it off
FlutterDash: Hahaha
CK|Catnap: Dont questions the Joker's methods
....his eyes clearly just derped in the middle of that
VenHur: indeed. i gotta say i've been quite impressed with the hub latley.
Did you see that?
Aww c'mon Val that's his best one yet.
ALFRED
2,14 and I've tolerated it more than I should have
Bronysith: well ive heard hes going to. might as well buy your pitchforks
Hey everypony! :)
Yeah I suppose I can give you that.
pirate_sprinkle: bitch please, pitchforks are too easy fro him
lali-ho Ponies47
hi Ponies47
ah this one
impressive it is
YUSH
hi Ponies47
And no for a Rhythm break
guys knock it off he's showing Batman for pete's sake!
fine. why do cannibals prefer to eat emos? cause they come pre-sliced
XylemTube: Tell me about it, I mean, Frangle Rock?! Two Batmans for the price of one?! A GOOD My Little Pony Cartoon?!
kick one its all in the mind
Hi, Ponies47 :)
hey Ponies47
WHY dress Sweetie Belle up like Chibi-Moon?
12I bought a small figure on ebay
XylemTube: The Hub is probally the only good thing to watch on TV nowadays, and I hoped they keep it that way!
1227th august seller said they sent it 30th august
Kencolt because japanese themed remix
Who is streaming? O.O
00,02guys: https://isc.sans.edu/diary.html?storyid=14107 'IE Zero Day is "For Real"'
"EYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH"
12I've had stuff from Japan, USA etc
FlutterDash: knock it off
12this was in the UK
00,02basically if you use ie right now your computer will be owned
12and it STILL hasn't arrived, sent two messages no responce
FlutterDash_: lame copy-paste
oh dear, those poor people who still use IE
Ah well, he didn't listen.
Still funny though.
Chuck Norris did that perfect run...without pressing anything.
YUS
00,02BATMAN
Phase4: oh i read about that today lol. i kinda feel sorry for microsoft screwing up IE again
dat ban
12ebay you'd think would be more trusting I guess...the community I bought 90% of stuff would be less than eBay I'd say ;w;
Meanwhile: that emo joke ws kinda funny lol
*was
00,02pirate_sprinkle, it was pre-screwed, the hackers just pointed it out
Opening Credits...in a nutshell: "I'm Batman, god damn it!"
12but nope LOL
/me i'm gonna kick your aaaaaaaaas
ass*
Phase4: good thing i dont use IE
VenHur and if you noticed where it was twi DJ, he messed up the perfect, and then it was brought back
00,02pirate_sprinkle, it actually effects every version of ie >= 6 (possibly earlier but no one tests)
/me i'm gonna stand heeeeere aaand poooooose
oooo, scarecrow!
Scarecrow ep? :D
wait, people use IE?
00,02Jim, people do, its wierd
Oh, boy! Scarecrow! :D
I thought it was just a bad joke from Microsoft
Phase4: oh, i thought it was just the last one. daamn, they don fuqed up :S
what happened with IE?
Viruses happened
Now peoples, I know this may sounds crazy, but I never readt a comic book...
when?
the seller probably sent it cheapest option possible heh
but, well, that always was a problem with IE
last week, and it's still going on
VenHur: That's alright. I'm not really a person who reads comics.
Phase4: what exactly does this thing do?
So I may not know some of the lesser known Batman villains...
I'm using it right now...
12Probably but they said "1st class" on their shipping thing >__>
...that'S not how you reload a tommyy gun
funny, i was actually willing to give the new IE a shot cause i felt bad for them, guess thats out of the question
I'd suggest changing to Mozilla Firefox or Chrome
00,02Dark__Horst, 'use after free' bug, basically they can crash ie. its possible to extend the bug and run code remotely
12still, they should at least communicate with me
12they're not even doing that
Like Scarecrow, like Mr. Freeze...or Poison Ivy...or that clay guy...
ah right
that might be bad
12I'm giving them 3-5 more days
Hi everyone!
maybe they haven't sent it then
12give them negative feedback
....wow
Hi Joy
Wow, that guy was angry.
hi Joy
hey Joy
But I do know the Joker, The Penguin, and Harly Quinn.
hoi Joy
12and somehow a refund
Hi, Joy! :)
Dick move, man
:)
VenHur: what about Two-Face?
12Probably not...but they said they had because they "dispatched" it on 30th
"If your dead dad was alive, he'd have died from shame"
hi jojoyasmin
I dunno but maybe try contacting ebay first before leaving feedback
"Good thing your dad's dead, because he'd die of shame over you, Bruce!"
Tiny TOONS :O
12and I HATE when people lie about sending stuff early
Oh yeah, fucking Two-Face is awesome!
DAT TINY TOON ADVENTURES REFERENCE
huhuhu *boom*
12What would I say to them?
TINY TOONS!
VenHur, Riddler? Lesser known?
Scarecrow :O
they can retaliate and leave you neg feedback too and it can harm you
12I've never had this problem before LOL
His parents were gunned down in front of him, how about toning down the "father would be ashamed" crap, Mr Old Fart, kthx.
Bithc please
Hi Joy
12true
sometimes i wonder if some of the guys on the show worked on fallout too
Of course, it's WARNER
00,02if his dad was alive there would be no batman
Oh yeah, the Riddler...
with all that retro-futuristic style
Oh shit
VenHur: remember Two Face?
it's this villian
Not sure but I'm sure there's the paypal disputes and ebay could temp ban his account
SCARECROOOOOOOOOW
Scarecrow.
12I'd be okay if the seller was all "I'm really sorry...I'm away for 2 weeks I'll send it then"
scarecrow
12but noo
R2D2 WHERE ARE YOU?
Awackawhat.
00,02LEARNING
Scarecrow is pretty cool
ARACNO-PHOBIA
I remember Two Face, his two faces (no pun intended) freaks me out in The Dark Knight...
12he has 100% positive feedback as well
12=/
A point-- with few exceptions almost every one of Batman's main villains is at least partly a lunatic. Probably the most sane one is the Penguin-- who may be odd looking, but never dives into the crazy like most of the pack.
He reminds me of the Boogeyman from Billy and Mandy. :D
00,02now you know what aracnophobia is
12How do you do a dispute? ;w;
but i already knew what it was
AND NOW YOU KNOW
100 positive feedback really?
And learing is half the battle
12Yep =/
the more you know~
Thundercats!
Then try contacting them again then try getting ebay to contact them if you can
yes, becasue a bit of gasoline in a STEEL VAULT will do so much damage
12At first I thought he sent it in an envelope and it got lost but...
I really liked Scarecrow's re-design in Batman Arkham Asylum
lol- a gasmask
12no communication from them makes me ponder
If The Hub got this and Batman Beyond, why not the Stephen Speilburg cartoons?
if they have a perfect feedback there's probably a good reason maybe
12I'm not sure how I'd go about making eBay contact them o.o
I'm just saying.
Because scarecrows are scary.
there will be a way I'm sure
if not ebay then paypal
ohhh you touch my tra la la
oh this be the first appearance of scarecrow
VenHur: legit question........warner copyrights, perhaps?
My favorite Two-Face moment: "Look at us...we're all freaks. And who made us this way? BATMAN!"
:)
Dark92Enigma: Yeah, could be.
not his father
Bruuuuce, I am disappooooiiiiiiint
poor batman :'(
FATHER
:'(
Dark__Horst: As did I.
ah batman nice
if only it was luke in there
awesome revenge plan, scarecrow. pouring some gasoline IN A STEEL VAULT with a SPRINKLER SYSTEM
12ooh theres this resolve a problem thing
12okay
AJIsAwesome: wat?
12I'll give them a day or so to reply to my message today
12then I'm going to do that
wait, why did he try to torch a bank?
What if he put gas in the sprinkler system?
Dark__Horst: Scarecrow's redesign.
ok
AJIsAwesome: what about it?
12I gave them nearly 1 and a half weeks to reply to my first message
sprinkle system?
actually their feedback maybe 100 percent positive but how many neutrals do they have?
AJIsAwesome: It was me that said that
How did he escape? Because HE'S BATMAN!
Dark__Horst: WASN'T that supossed to liven the fire instead of putting it down?
Whoops. :4
*:$
Nittany_Discord Sprinkers don't work that way
12It says everything is positive
You can make them work that way with enough gas.
Ouch..........
Backstory Time
Lunatic.
nice guy
Dark92Enigma: i dont think sprinkler systems normally liven fire, no
lunatic!
12I'm wondering if I go to the post office...maybe they'd somehow tell me if they sent it or not?
Y-Y-Y-Y-You're Crazy!
12I'm not sure if they can tell o.o;
Told you.
Dark92Enigma: oh wait, you were joking. people confuse me tonight
Boogeyman could learn a lesson from this guy.
DISCO!
mmmm, million dollars
Batman has a rave :D
AJIsAwesome: and i still dont know what you're trying to tell me
12It MIGHT have got lost, it's really small
Needs a batshave.

12I'd say about a month ago
Puns!
Mark is the best Joker, hands down!
10on eBay?
...Err, HOOFS down!
12I remember when they were all over eBay and I was late in getting them, fortunately a seller had them
12yeah :3
you aint lyra VenHur
10I can't find them atm
12I was pretty late getting them >_<
He is funny and psychotic, hooves down. Mark Hamill is best animated Joker.........
12and they were originally sold seperately, sometimes together
^
He's especially good in the Batman Beyondmovie (the good version, not the broadcast "softened" version.)
LASERS
PG-13 version, he meant.
have you ever heard the saying: ''If it's not broken, don't fix it?'' that's pretty much my guess with the other ''versions'' of the Joker in the different versions of Batman
playing dirty is the only way to play
03also how do you determine what to call bootleg? Companies like Tomy aren't licensed by Nintendo either...
moar puns

Caramel: updates?
2,14 no, this is full on installing game data
oh
and beside
Asylum is old
I don't think any update is needed
CrimsonPhoenix: chrono trigger is old
maybe it got deleted when you playeed SHAWN WHINE SIMULATOR 2012
but awesome
Evening, chat.
Hello Reikim
Hi, Reikim :)
hey Reikim whats going on aniki?
I see we're watching...an install screen.
Bronysith, can you tell me the relevence of that statement?
so was arkham city better than asylum because I'm getting mixed reveiws
Bronysith: with the current state of rpgs, chrono trigger has more gameplay. actual gameplay.
weeping_pegasi82, I'll say better
back
CrimsonPhoenix: you said "besides, arkham asylum is old"
city interesting
weeping_pegasi82: Just as good if not betterimo
CrimsonPhoenix even more than kingdom hearts?

Hello Eulshy
hai Eulshy
Eva version of Fly Me To The Moon is best version. Close second is the Bayonetta version.
Dken2021, what?
some said city was messy
Hi Eulshy
weeping_pegasi82: Heard City got a perfect score from one company.
Hey Eulshy
weeping_pegasi82, not for me
oh hey Eulshy
whoops, wrong ping CrimsonPhoenix
AJIsAwesome: That means nothing, of course.
2,14 well this is annoying
Reikim: Well, duh. :P
2,14 fucking finally
hi, Eulshy :)
weeping_pegasi82, it's pretty much everything that was awesome with asylum but bigger and better
do you have this on a disc?
why would it need to install?
it's messy probably because it's free-roam
aaaawww no hard mode?
Dken2021, you can install data in hardward for faster reading
2,14 the point is to enjoy a game, not watch val get murdered over and over at a game he hasn't played in years
I dun liek iBooze
So nopee
Caramel, Batman has a pretty basic concept in fighting mechanic
I have no reason to either :s
CrimsonPhoenix oh, I guess that would make sense
I don't think you will die
Caramel: But it can be fun to watch :)
00,10and bat man kills a cop
2,14 I'm aware of that
chat enjoys watching streamer get murdered over and over :3
the combat is really good in this game
2,14 I can turn the difficulty up if you really want
i remember playing this last year on the pc, it was a fun time
2,14 but don't bitch at me if I die
Caramel: nah its cool, i dont really care, im half-asleep anyway
Amazon's azx/azw format is difficult to crack too
oh dear
Caramel: Play it how you want
00,10I saw start off slow Caramel
I say start at Normal and work up to Hard.
00,10if you feel like it's too easy up the difaculty
that voice sounds familiar
oh hey there Sumica
the warden's
I remember when I stream I had alot of comment about my deaths in video game
On the other hand, watching Batman get repeatedly murdered would be amusing for at least five minutes.
it's mr herriman
/me glompels into Sumica s kneecaps
weeping_pegasi82: Two words. Mark Hamill.
so much I got used to it and laugh with the audience
or joke about it
CrimsonPhoenix: what did you stream
and shit like that
00,10owwww, careful
Freefall29, tons of stuff
Dose Batman have a plan for this?
THE WARDEN'S VOICE WHAT IS THE WARDEN'S VOICE FROM???
hello everypony!
he's batman, of course he does
The lighting and atmosphere of this game is fantastic.
CrimsonPhoenix: what kind of tons of stuff...
hai Raspberry
Man, this intro is still amazing. Such a good introduction for new people and comic fans alike.
Hi, Raspberry
Games
hi Raspberry
weeping_pegasi82: Mark Hamill. He played Luke Skywalker.
Caramel doing a Batman walkthrough?
Various games
hey Raspberry
eeyup
mostly single-player
possibly most of them were Nintendo games but yeah
The Warden sounds like Mr. herriman from Foster's. That's all Irecognize it from off the bat
Nananananana Batman
Reikim: NO WAY! I never knew that!
VenHur: Someone else said it, not me.

http://www.epubor.com/remove-ibooks-drm-read-ibooks-on-pc.html
thelonepony: lol
:D
I love Mark Hamill's work in this
Reikim, playing Touhou is like standing in the rain without getting wet
guys i got commando today
Aw, it's not THAT bad.
12...

And as long as you can deal with BS like Eirin's Last Spell.

12NO INTERNATIONAL BIDDERS
Reikim, the farthest I got was up to Remilia in EoSD Normal
12WTF
LOL
Actually ZUN's just lazy.
yeah thats stupid
And that's impressive, Gabe.
anyway off to bed night all
12Night Nick!
Oh, that's just DIRTY!
Especially EoSD, that's easily the hardest PC Touhou
But that was a while ago, so I wouldn't be able to do it again without a lot of practice
how old is this game?
Ha, same.
I haven't play MoF in over a year.
3-4 years old maybe
Probally 3 to 4 years...maybe 5...
wow, looks good for such an old game
My friend, on the other hand, has played enough MoF that he is quite literally incapable of playing anything below Lunatic.
still pretty impressive
Reikim, Oh yeah, I did get up Kanoko is MoF
killer croc, I don't think they use him much these days.
only fluttershy can tame this guy!
OH GOD
O.O
/me whimpers and hides under his blanket.
Raspberry: I have my doubts. that monster has no soul.
for all of those who have never played this game, your in for an AWESOME stream :D
I haven't...
00,10I threw a rock at him
/me Hugs CK|Catnap "It will be ok"
I like how the wheels aren't animated
Derpy_Hooves: *you're
I haven't either
Sumica: A ROCK?!
Sumica -_-
if it isnt a pony, fluttershy can tame it
Sumica: why did you throw a rock at me?
00,10it was a big rock
Sumica you throw rocks at everything D:
Sumica: Dumb rock!
...Tom strikes again...
Bronysith: don't correct my grammer :I
grammar*
The best way to practice Touhou is to practice on Lunatic
it wasnt a rock.... it was a boulder!
*make All the references*
but it wasn't a rock...it was a..rock lobster!
Jim: ROCK LOBSTER?!
ROCK LOBSTER!
rock lobster?
rock.
lobster.
I saw it on the beach.

i was told by several good bronies that the ep is this saturday!
MasterBrony, you're quite a twat
that troll was a fantastic troll.... even a major site like EQD fell for it.
I find it more depressing than anything.
Sumica: So do I, Sumica...
you actually listened to other people?
MasterBrony: Why? :S
rather than verify for yourself?
If it doesn't come directly from the Hub, I don't believe it

Freefall29, not really fantastic
YEAH TOAST!
If the date had been confirmed we'd all know it by now
excuse me while i post my same on facebook and alert other bronies that i was lied to

Freefall29: We're in the same boat. :D
You should learn how to say "Go to hell" in such a way that they will look forward to the journey.
Freefall29: because homework gets in the way of Bronystate
DJ_POn-3: exactly.
Re: Toto coming to Jammit?
Africa and Hold The Line, I will be excited if we get those
gaaahhh im wearing headphones now my left ear hurts :D :(
13why is rosie the robot taunting batman?
03yeah
03what about it
03it's not there yet
"Take a trip to the scenic Underworld! Marvel at the crimson landscapes! Dance gaily among the bitter flames! Gift shop open 24/7; buy a souvenir!"
iduno
Because she's a bitch.
Shizuka: who is harley quinns voice actress?
Africa is on a 5.1 SACD
03supposedly "coming soon"
Perfect
03is it?
the old fashioned way (being batman)
00,10funny thing Shizuka her boss is also knowen as Mr J
03is it like, actual multitrack though or just LOL blended instruments
o_o
she said that in the animated series
Freefall29: I don't remember the name of the actress, but she's the Animated Series one.
probably blended but you could probably use FFT based imagers to separate it out
03far too lazy to do that
batman: the animated series reference... thats is awesome
yes, it is effort.
13and now jane jetson is in on it
03but you wanna try to do that FFT stuff on some Jammit tracks to make an "alternate instruments" track for me?
03inb4 no
03I have guitar, drums, bass, vocals
hey yo wuts up everypony:)
Freefall29: VenHur : Arleen Sorkin
sup scout19_tf2
03and then "all but drums", "all but guitar" etc
Hello scout19_tf2
hi scout19_tf2
Hey scout19_tf2. Nothing much
03somehow there's a way to ascertain the missing stuff
scout19_tf2: /)
13shizu freemane needed a grappling hook .-.
So anyway, rephrase: is there a nice, polite way of saying "this is stupid, you are stupid, and I'm going to go somewhere else to be less stupid"?
Howdy ho scout19_tf2!
keep in mind it won't always work
03yeah
this is arkham asylum right?
03usually they just use phase inversion
yup
and CCX in A3/4 probably best quality
03but there might be a better way?
12!Shipping
DJ_POn-3: Yup.
03NO
12:|
03anyway brb
and wut r we watching today
Arlham city is funner and more funny
Try constructive criticism
Because this is mentally incompetant.
Arkham Asylum.
The Jetsons are responsible for this!?
12XD
12seeya
i have used QQMT, and it's great if QQMT is enough quality, because it's quite a visual and intuitive way to do it
so Harley likes B-man and Mr. J
12!Shipping
4 BlueFlare is paired with prince-lemon
I know where THAT is going
13so when do we get back to desmond
Or how about
but if you can't get enouigh quality then you needa go A, which is like, numbers and sliders
13this is assassins creed right
Ryunosuke: harley likes anybody who smacks her around.
Shizuka: Place a laser mine on the ground and jump over it to clear a few gaps or walls (if you have above 70 health .-.)
Because this could only ever exist in your deluded fanboy brain and would never be physically plausible.
nonono
you completely missed it :)

hey everyone. its the bronystate drinking game. every time someone asks about the date for s3, take a shot.
Bronysith: she will
pirate_sprinkle: err, song
Bronysith: she will
Shizuka, I said! I don't speak jive!

its the 22nd. its the 22nd. its the 22nd. its the 22nd.
thelonepony: k ill try that. I'll be back later
Batman just a troll
pirate_sprinkle: she only had 1 episode that people remember her for, and the other one isnt really applejack cause derpy talked in it and now no one remembers what applejack did that episode
00,10dose !cd count as asking?
I say yes
Bronysith: I remember applejack... I liked that episode
Gotham really needs to impliment the death penalty.
I LOVE these tapes
Meanwhile: ending to arkham city was good
I mean, they have electric chairs in there. Are they just for show or what?
Yes he is
Bronysith: well its not the riters fault if the fans dont have enough of an attention span to remember both aj and derpy from the ep
2,14 arkham city sucked. I will only play it unless chat overwhelmingly demands it
pirate_sprinkle: it is the writers fault however to give one time characters their own songs before applejack
inb4 everyone requests arkham city
Speaking of Batman http://i.imgur.com/B9pTB.jpg
Woah
Arkham City! Arkham City! Arkham City! ...There, UHAPPY?
That joker be playing that silly las like an accordion
I hope they don't try to make twilight more important then she really is in season 3, such has all of a sudden she has a bro that is getting married to a princess.
00,10it has tara, of corse they will demand it
Caramel, I'm actually curious why you think so

Mahboi
Stream go down?
Nope, mine borked.
thelonepony: no, it died
she is the least popular pony
i thought there wasnt supposed to be S3 talk on here?
ZUUL
Stream is down here
Bronysith: she will, i bet 100 bits on it
Bronysith: they gave spike singing lines for crying out loud. thats a sign they gotta.
Narry a stream be in sight.
Eulshy: Nothing that constitutes a spoiler.
Bronysith: the writers are perfectly aware that she doesnt have a song, im sure the over..enthuastic fans have pelted them with enough messages
Other than the fact i now know spike has a singing part
I know he's getting Arkham City...I can FEEL it!
pirate_sprinkle: they will give spike his own song before applejack, they will give everypony and their mother a song before applejack
A first for Spike.
Eulshy: to be fair, that was Freefall29 who spoiled that
00,10Caramel crashed by the look of it
Indeed, guess his internet died
yeah, that's what I thought.
It happens
Bronysith: that was a spoil?
Bronysith: she'll have a song, i have nou doubt about it
why applejack sings amazingly
Remember when it used to be "blacked out"?
I thought my internet died
:'(
DJ_POn-3: because no one likes applejack
unfortunetley
And remember when they added the idiotic "Reikim rushed his pokemon to the centre, protecting them from further harm..."
applejack is best poni
or however the fuck you spell that
hi
AJIsAwesome: isnt she awesome?
bleh
Wait, it's not 'blacked out'?
Ohi CCCP
DJ_POn-3: Yes.
hi Obsidian
ohai CCCP :P
why am i now thinking of tidus, fucking hell, Final fantasy 10 was good stuff, but tidus is just soooo bad
http://derpy.me/byd6W
hi CCCP
I always thought it said 'blacked out'
They changed it.
or...
Hm.
hello AJIsAwesome and thelonepony
hello CCcP
I know both have been used.
But then again, I rarely lost in pokemon
sup CCCP
hi Princess_Cadence and Freefall29
*snigger snigger*
I think "whited out" was used in G1.
Tidus: HAH HA HAH HA H- Me: U SHADDAP!
Actually.
Oh I lost so much
Usually the Elite Four, especially after G2
I think the guy has stopped streaming. not a derp, its not on
Sorry, I has to do that for a reason...
(cheating goddamn bastards want to choke them all)
Only played Gold.
And I had a gameshark so I just obliterated everything with a level 100 Charizard.
I played blue, red, yellow, gold, silver and crystal
Freefall29: His internet crashed
I did not have a gameshark
"Elite Four *x* used one FULL RESTORE!"
yay I got it working without my computer freezing!
still killed everything with my charizard
"Reikim tossed his GBA through the window!"
12I FEEL SICK
Ruby and Sapphire were the start of much E4 bullshit.
:<
darn buffer
I have Platinum and after a year I have yet to beat them because they are SUCH bullshit.
ok.... so..... anypony got suggestions to bring chat, chatty again?
I recall having to reload a save before Lugia umpteen times because I kept knocking the schmuck out instead of catching it.
The worst part was that the evolved water starter in G4 sucks ass.

Ponies47: pfft, if i sa people dancing to gangam thats what i would do.
*saw
SpadeMagnes[R]: Just like Mandy.
Ponies47 nevermind
But that's pretty far out, isn't it?
Meanwhile has smiled before
You can download it when you spell it right.

Welcome back Dark92Enigma :)
Hey Princess_Cadence you there?
Haio Dark92Enigma
AJIsAwesome: i said goodbye last night, but stream was too fast to notice me
Dark92Enigma: okay.
AJIsAwesome: by the way, i'm watching ''A Dog and Pony show''
Cool.
lol dem Rarity eyes......''is there something wrong Spike?''
oh there come the Gollum Diamond Dogs
inb4 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Just to let you know, when I saw the episode for the first time I laughed incredibly hard when the shortest diamond dog tried to imitate Rarity's whining. :D
AJIsAwesome: is it me, or they remind me of Scratch and Grounder?
Dark92Enigma: I never thought of that.
/me ''I thought you HAD it!''
Since there are three, I don't really think so.
No, the series saved it for Snips and Snails
they don't have the voices, but they are annoying
IMO
Chat is so active today.......... :D
ikr?
D: an active chatroom
Hell, it had more activity during BATMAN TAS
No stream right? can i post a video?
If no stream go ahead.

kirzstryfe: The screencap I'm using wasn't pasted as a separate layer, and by moving it around it's all over the place. Halp?

00,02makes you think dont it
YOU WANNA HEAR WHINING? THIS IS WHINING!
Ohai Lil_B
I thought that read 2012 when I first saw it XD
Phase4 me not, I know so many people how watched the Power Puff Girls as a kid, mostly Boys XD
and yes, hi all XD
Lil_B: me included!
00,02Lil_B, tbh i didnt see it until i was older
thanks CountDoofus
Nugh, this harnass is too tight! It's going to chafe, can't you loosen it? Uh, it hurts, and IT'S SO RUSTY! Why didn't you clean it first? It's gonna leave a STAAAAAAIIIN! The wagon's getting heavy, why do I have to pull iiiiiit?!
00,02old enough that society was trying to push me away from catoons, but not old enough to get the humor
and now the little diamond dog imitates her
You did not........
Phase4 this was one of the only good shows people without Kable TV got to watch :)
call
her
mule
YOU DID NOT!
^ Reminds me of The Room.
And now Rarity is looking at the 4th wall ''just look at me''
Oh hai CountDoofus!
00,10oh hi all
Haio Dark92Enigma and Sumica :)
hi thar Sumica
hia Dark92Enigma :)
Hi, Sumica :)
Dark92Enigma: I laughed incredibly hard when he imitated her. :D
00,10So if I was to say pick up digimon would you all want US or JP version?
Morning Sumica
The movie or episodes?
sooo Nintendo announces new Console for 2012 in E3 2011 ... Sony announces slimmer PS3 in Fall 2012
Sumica japanese
proof that WoW has gone to hell http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&list=PLIT_A6m1Gl-lkxt7meTbwIcHm2HTS37uq&v=TlpgMQkxcQY
25man heroic raid cleared with a single class
I'm used to the US version
Sumica: I would probably say Japanese.
Sumica: For me it'd depend on the series.
00,10have you ever not been able to read them kirzstryfe?
only when I'm trying to do other stuff too :P
05kirzstryfe: well they used a priest adn shamym on spine to dispel
Sumica I usually don't care about bad translations, but Digimon got a bed translations and a bad redone music
you know it's still bad Wrek :P
05plus at this point heroic has a -35% on all stats on the bosses
05so its understadnable to how they managed
I got a new Keyboard todasy, its mechanical, its rather heavy -.-
05i call clever use of game mechanics
05deathcoil to heal
AJIsAwesome: IKR? Wah wah (shut up)
05plus the self healf opf DK tanks
Hey everypony
05it adds up really
don't get me wrong, I think it's cool that they managed to pull it off
ohai Serenity
Lil_B: and the puns.....OMG the puns
So many death knights. . .
00,10not supprised at all it's all DK's
That's hilarious.
00,02Sumica, 0.17 is out
00,10yeah I know
Not sure why it's seen as proof that WoW has gone to hell.
00,0214 bodies in the solar system
00,02i've got work to do
Other than the massive amount of dead people walking.
00,10tryed telling you yesterday there was a patch coming
Phase4: Oopsee?
clear an entire raid with a class designed for tank/dps
00,02Sumica, yeah, aparently i didnt notice
00,02ah well
Hey, kirzstryfe, hows life treating you?
00,10but yeah the all DK thing been doing that for ages
DKs were not designed to handle being healers
long work hours, don't have a day off until sunday >.<
>roll death knight. Tries to be healer of groups.
Monk <3
00,10Dk's were realy a pita when they had the self rez
Hello everyone.
Sumica: Don't remind me
Hello, Meanwhile
ohai Meanwhile
Dark92Enigma yeah "Butterflkly" is an amazing song
Do DKs still have that corpse res thing?
/me hugs Meanwhile
Barbetos|AtWork: I beleive so
Zombie follower or whatever.
00,10ok I will see if I can find adventure here today for future showing
But they nerfed the hell out of it
05healign DK is somewhat viable apparently
Wait what?
05yeah
05specially with death coil
/me still can't play DK for unknown reasons
0518k absorbon shield on friendly targets
"Healing DK is somewhat viable"
"Somewhat viable"
See, now I totally want to see the absurdity of 25 manning dragon soul with only Mages.
I just find the irony in "DEATH Knight" and the concept of them healing. I mean, they have the word death.
05its still outclassed by proper healign classes
05but with a well geared tank
05that knows what hes doign
I find it tragic that DK's can heal anyone other than themselves at all.
those are quite difficult to find Wrek
Meanwhile: Frost DK's can
05Serenity: yeah that was hilarious :D
Serenity: That was fantastic.
Heya everyone :)
I did it :3
The World of Warcraft, it is a silly place.
00,10well I am exausted from gravyard so see you all in 8 hours
Death dealing heals.
Night Sumi.
05see ya sumi
05sleep well
00,10Sleep time is nao
Bye, Sumi
Later Sumi
night Sumica
g'night Sumica
Sleep well, Sumica
Goodnight Sumica
See ya Sumica
Dark92Enigma yeah, I heard it once... I found the puns to be... funny once, but I wouldn't want to see the whole series like this -.-
Lil_B: anyway, here's the kickass theme: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCMgx7T-QcI
And now, Helix Nebula
I'm amazed how many of you played or play WoW
Well, maybe a death knight can heal someone by stealing the life from an enemy.
00,02oh wow, new motor
Back in my day we had to walk to the dungeon.
Dark92Enigma Dide, I have the Soundtrackl XD
Dude*
Serenity: Paaaandas
00,02more than twice as efficent in vacume as the old ones
WoW....never saw the appeal behind it.
Five miles uphill in the snow.
YEAH TOAST!
And all the people in my class have played it but me.
Screw pandas, Monks are where it's at
Dark92Enigma: Hey Digimon.
Lil_B: and here's the funny thing, Even when i've heard the Pokemon movie made it to the big screen in my country, i had NO CLUE THE DIGIMON MOVIE MADE IT TO THE US.....
I remember when LFG was something you said in general chat.
Well, they made /4 didn't they?
I kinda wish I could play WoW in that wondrous high resolution with all the graphics turned up to max and still have that nice 30 fps
No one used /4 !
ASoftFluffyThing: If it makes you feel better, I've never played WoW either. :P
No scratch that, some people did, because they thought it was the guild recruitment channel.
Ohai Meanwhile!
Only Blizzard game I've ever played is Starcraft and its sequel
Gold_Demona: me neither
Barrens chat, bunch of fucktards, but I'd love to listen in because I was around 7 at the time
One does not simply Barrens Chat.
Lil_B: And that's because it was US oriented, 3 separate movies with no co-rrelation between them whatsoever
(is 15 now :P)
Gold_Demona: I never saw the appeal behind WoW. And the thing is, my one of my teachers plays it.
Serenity: happy birthday!
Dark92Enigma what I really hat is that, even though they used the original for the translation in germany, they used the US Movie here, I have seen the original Digimon movie, was really good, and almost all without Dialoge
Dark92Enigma: I've been 15 a while ._.
But I'll accept your present anyhow >:3
Gold_Demona: So it's me, 2 other people and my teacher. WoW nerds. All I could do was facepalm
Once upon a time it took 2 people at the summon stone ten minutes to get all the raid there.
00,10have bank and tabbard
Dark92Enigma yes, I'm a huge Digimon Nerd myself, XD
Still haven't gotten into a group to take down Ragnaros in the firelands
Go to bread Sumi.
Meanwhile: Thank god for Have group will travel, ey?
ASoftFluffyThing: It seems like a fun game, I just never felt like leaving the mmo games I'm currently playing.
00,10also found digimon 01 in dual audio
Lil_B: Favorite season?
Unfortunately, because most of my time is spent at school
I can never get into raids because I simply don't have enough hours put in
Serenity: And yet people still managed to need a summon by the time you hit the first boss.
Gold_Demona: I never wanted to play it and I'm sure not playing it now. One, because of money. Two, because I absolutely refuse
Lil_B: i AM aware the original OVAs were more concise to the plot, and they do shut up, so they can let us get into the atmosphere of the scene itself, if you know what i mean
Kinixys first and second
Meanwhile: It's the WoW community, they do crazy Pinkie Pie things
Serenity: happy.....belated birthday? :$
Gold_Demona: Then again, I said the same thing about Minecraft. Lo and behold two months ago, guess who's playing Minecraft?
Ah, Meanwhile. Reikum said you could confirm he's gifted at getting lost in video games. True?
I stopped playing Minecraft
ASoftFluffyThing: Sounds to like you're mostly not playing it just to be contrary. =/
Next time I'm gonna play it is with you guys
CountDoofus: Reikim has the sense of direction of a bowl of rice pudding.
WoW community does crazy things because they're bored with the game, but won't actually quit
IMO, it went to shithole state at 1.8
^That.
Gold_Demona: Is that a good thing? I didn't want to play it when it first came out.
:D
Kinixys mostly because It began more dificult to follow the different evolution stages in the later ones :/
I won't play WoW, cause I would just be jumping into something that's already ancient and I heard it's worse since all the changes.
CountDoofus: He once got lost in a cave with only two exits.
Allow me to "LOLi"
LOL!*
Reikim is directionally challenged, that I can confirm
Ancient? WoW? You should look at EVERQUEST
iLOL! yay for spanish :3
THAT is ancient
Everquest isn't shit, it's just unfair as bullfuck
kirzstryfe: I played very little of WoW, and it was good while it lasted......i'm not gonna sit through a whole day of WoW, after watching that South Park episode based uopn that game
Serenity: True dat
/me doesn't get the appeal behind RPGs
And yet I still play it...
WoW isn't ancient. It just looks that way.
Thing is once upon a time I was part of a guild that did silly random stuff practically every week. Like, one time we had this race from Thunder Bluff to the Undercity using only level 1's.
CountDoofus: lol Ancient. Again. Look at EverQuest
WoW is really demanding for it's technology, it shows how shitty the engine is nowadys
Lil_B: That it did!
im back
Heyo.
kirzstryfe: upon*
Hey LightTrooper105
My old laptop is transferrring shit at 3mb/s
hello ASoftFluffyThing
Serenity: It's also OLD
My tower transfers at 600 MB/s...
>doesn't see the appeal behind RPGs
Atm, I play Guild Wars 2.
>played zOMG! on Gaia Online for about 2 years
>Insert facedesk here
Serenity 600 MB/s?!
I've played some Spiral Knights. Not much of an MMO really.
Lil_B: It has top end i7
6 core
ASoftFluffyThing: LOL GaiaOnline! I used to hang out there! XD
Parp?
Serenity yeas, but even if I had an i7 I wouldn't be able to go ever 360kb/s
Gold_Demona: I know, riiiiight! My account there is STILL active and I havent been on there much in the past 2 years
Lil_B: What the hell i7 are you USING?
Spiral Knights was amusing for a while.
Then you learn to solo everything and get lonely.
^
ASoftFluffyThing: LOL Me too! XD
Oh yeah, should mention I overclock them as well
Serenity wait... I think i derped... wer weren't talking about Internet connection >.<
Gold_Demona: Oh my lawrd we should like, zOMG! together. Provided it hasn't gone downhill in the past 4 years
Lil_B: I'm talking about computer transfer speed
Gold_Demona: I know there was this one miniboss callled the Land Shark in Gold Beach and he used to show up after 30 minutes if you were a 10.0
ASoftFluffyThing: lol, I didn't mess with zOMG very much. I think they came out with that not long before I stopped going to Gaia. :P
Serenity yeah, I derped, I was thinking about internet connection :/
/me facehoof
Meanwhile: They've tried to give it a story and missions to sustain their playerbase, but it's stuff that really should have been there to begin with. They took a hard hit when Diablo3 came out.
^ suprised
Diablo 3 was bullshit
Aye
It was?
Managed one playthrough of D3.
^
Haven't touched it since.
^^
I shouldn't know. Never played DIablo 3.
Gold_Demona: It was fun till they started messing with everything. I remember when you FIRST started z!, you were on the train and this dude named Frank for something had taught you the basics of rings and all that.
AJIsAwesome: Diablo 3 was a bigger disappointment than Duke Nukem Forever
same here Meanwhile >.<
Really? That bad? :S
Yes
Wow. :S
Don't mistake disappointment for worse.
No, Diablo 3
heh
Duke Nukem was crispy fried vomit, but I think after that long and with it's development history it was bound to be.
The only remotely fun bit of that game was the planning at the start
D3 wasn't really bad, just disappointing for the time it took to be released and the restrictions in place on it
I actually liked Duke Nukem Forever, I mean only the level layout and enemy AI was bad :/ otherwise I got everything, rediculus Stuff
The planboard was the most fun I had in that game
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvrKTNJfRTI SFM. Amazing program.
/me wonders if she still has the quick fingers for zOMG! Hm....
Lil_B: I think most of the problem with Duke Nukem Forever is the content. It was... wow.
finally found a good webshop in geermany with MLP-shirts, :) getdigital.de
im surprise I have Duke Nukem Forever when I remember not buying it
Barbetos|AtWork: Nice. :D
Gold_Demona what content? I expected the game to have Tits and really really dirty and offensive humor, thats what the Duke was always about, what did people expect?!
LightTrooper105: I played the demo, and didn't even BOTHER to pirate it
Barbetos|AtWork: OMG win!
lol
Lil_B: That's about it, to be honest. :P
god, I LOVED being the Healer in zOMG
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta8Z8jXwu9E WoW stuff.
Then to be fair, never was a fan of Duke Nukem
... getdigital.de ... I havethe language selection german, english, binary, hex or leet ... o god what nerds
damnit, they appearently don't have the Pirate partie my litttle Pony shirt anymore :(
I'm feeling nostalgic for evasion tanking...
XD
Meanwhile: Ahn Quiraj, oh where did the years go?
Rogue was fun back in Vanilla wow.
I miss them days
They all got chain shot by C'thuns eye beam in the start Serenity.
Monk is very close to vanilla rogue
I really miss vanilla Hunter.
/me casts swirly ball.
Meanwhile: First boss, everyone was murcered brutally because of thorns
I hated Vanilla huntards
It took skill to use hunter then.
Until they changed their playstile in cata, they were pretty much scum of the game
My annoyance to Hunters passed over when I ninja'd Thori'dal from 2.
I totally need to get the warglaives
Did you also leave group and hearth afterwards? XD
Ooh Deadman's Shadow is open permanently. Still not much on Buccaneer Boardwalk though. Fuck.
I /really/ wanted to go to BB
Well, I say ninjad. I won it fair and square but the crying I got for it would tell you otherwise.
Meanwhile: Did you need it? Like need need it?
Should of left group and hearthed, then never talked to them ever again, just to seal the deal.
BiS statstick. Ofc I needed it.
Ahh, okay
Presumed you woulda played a different class or something
Everytime they pm you for a group or something, immediately go into DND mode XD
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Toywiz Lists Collector Sets and Fluttershy Plushies for Pre-Order
I played a rogue.
Heh, all this talk makes me want a Bronystate WoW server
Ugh. Gross
You know, worlds first Thori'dal drop went to a rogue.
^ No suprise
Because we totally couldn't get our greedy mitts on enough legendaries by then anyway.
I wish I would of did that fishing script back when Burning Crusade was new with my Rogue.
Oh well.
Even now, rogues have barely any legendarys
From what I hear I wouldn't even be able to equip Thori'dal in Mists.
It's true
Which makes owning it that much more fun.
Only huntards can use bows now.
I guess Thori'dal will have to be content sat next to my Warglaives and Thunderfury.
Do you have Raggies hammer?
I'm a rogue, I couldn't even use that when it was current.
I know you can't
Mind you, I used to know a druid who had it.
Mage here. I've got Thunderfury in my bags somewhere. :P
I used to play a mage, moved to druid, then paladin, now I'm gonna play a Monk
I'm staying Mage.
Oh, I've also got Dragonwrath on my mage. :p
Why does no one ever mention the Ulduar legendary?
Because I can't wield Val'anyr?
But Ulduar was like, the best instance.
I prefer Naxxramas. OLD Naxxramas.
People don't think of it
Still have five splinters of Atiesh. *sniff*
But Wrath was probably the best expac content wise
Old Naxxramas caused night terrors.
I mean Ulduar, vehicles
It also caused Tier 3, Meanwhile. The best mage set around.
Lasharus: Don't you need like 50 or 30?
True, Naxx gear was pretty cool, but good lord the horror.
HELLO
You mean people Serenity? 40.
Think he meant splinters.
Oh right.
Yeah ^
Also 40 :P
back from shower :D
I know it's a 40 raid
Back in the days when you could carry around Ashbringer.
And a full lvl 70 raid for Old Naxxramas struggled more than a 25-man lvl 80 raid in New Naxxramas.
But yeah, I'm currently wearing my tier 3. Because why the hell not. :P
hi there
Because only like, 100 people still have their Tier 3.
To any mod-person, am I allowed to quickly post an image link?
yes
You're allowed to post image links all the time, unless they're nsfw.
That, Meanwhile, and it looks awesome.
This was just after I got my Dragonwrath:
http://i517.photobucket.com/albums/u338/lasharus123/WoWScrnShot_040712_223550.jpg
That does look magnificent.
As I understand it, image links are always allowed, as long as you don't spam a whole bunch of 'em
Fair enough, I just try to obey the rules. And thank you Meanwhile. :p
Lasharus: What's the mount looklike?
Never seen Tarecgosa mount
Looks like Tarecgosa.
video links are also aloud only when theres no stream
It's not too bad. Hang on, I'll find a screeny of me flying about as Tarecgosa.
I find it stupid how Monks can't use Daggers
Being a roguelike class, I'd expect them to be able to
Ah, here we go.
http://i517.photobucket.com/albums/u338/lasharus123/WoWScrnShot_040712_224402.jpg
I find it stupid how Warriors can use staves.
lemme guess, they're the class that uses their fist?
Lash has been around for about seven years now, and I don't really see myself quitting the character.
Lasharus: Oh, it's one of those drakes
Yeah.
I don't like them imo
I prefer proto drakes
Looks quite similar to all 3 of the Dragon Soul mounts.
I don't mind 'em too much.
Meanwhile: Same model, different colour
And frankly, proto drakes wouldn't work. They're prehistoric dragon ancestors. Tarecgosa's slightly more evolved. :P
I have a Power Ranger Proto Drake team.
You mean five colours?
I wonder how many of 'em I've got, actually...
Mm.
Green, Red, Rusted, Iron-bound...
I think that's the lot.
Oh, Violet.
Meanwhile: Haha
I wish I could remember the pass to my old account
I've got, Red, Blue, Violet, Green, Rusted, Iron-Bound and Time Lost.
You've got the time-lost one?
AND IT TOOK ME FUCKING FOREVER.
Those who wish to not see graphic murder may want to look away... NOW.
hi
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwhrUYFwxgE&feature=g-vrec
A mate on my server accidentally flew into it.
It was horrible, I can still see the valley in Storm Peaks when I close my eyes.
Twice.
When he told me about it he flew off the edge of Dalaran, without any mounts to help him.
He made a lovely crater.
Oh god it was like, the worst find ever. I was playing LoL in another window and then suddenly the rare alarm went off.
Meanwhile: Bastard
not many people here yet...
NPCScan? :P
Let me add a lucky to that
Hm. I can't get gizoogle to work. I want to translate the US Constitution into jive.
/me sigh
And it was lagging so much I actually couldn't see it when the window changed
nope, not yet
btw am cooking breakfast, will be idle
I had to call some guildies on skype to kite it for me while I navigated half of Storm Peaks through lag.
Least you got it. :P
True.
/me grabs onto Meanwhile and has a crying fit "The internet is just a stupid place! Everyone is SO MEAN!! BWAAAAAAA!!"
...need a bit of help there, Meanwhile?
Nah, I got it.
It could be worse
I could be bob with the man tits.
Now you cry.
Indeed.
Meanwhile: What srver do you play on?
And, equally importantly, which region?
Serenity: I think when I stopped I was camped on Earthen Ring, I've been on a few servers. And EU.
We're both EU
Dammit, Hellscream here
Turalyon EU.
Entire team is EU.
Yay, we're all Brits?
You'd think so, wouldn't you?
But no, I'm not quite British. Close, but not quite.
/me sips tea and adjusts his monocle.
/me copies Meanwhile
My mannerisms certainly are. Practically all I drink is tea, and I have been repeatedly told I sound like Her Royal Majesty.
/me chucks Lasharus at Meanwhile
Leading to many remarks such as 'm'lady', which are mildly vexi- OY!
^_^
/me steps to one side.
/me throws Meanwhile's cinderblock factory at kirzstryfe
Nice to see you again kirz- Oof. Yeah, that was the ground. Ow.
Anyway, I'm from the Netherlands.
Close to England, but a short swim off.
Lash is pseudo-Brit
Grmpf.
:3
I've been called my server's very own Stephen Fry. I think the 'pseudo' fails to be accurate.
I'm sure we can make you an honourary Englishmen.
Two of 'em?
(I'm sure you meant 'EnglishMAN, but I'm a cynic)
Wow, haha
lol
Yeah that's what I meant.
lol
could make you an honourary Englishwoman if you keep whining about it :P
You have no right to that, kirz.
That'd be English lady.
Oh look. Some one "barrowed" Wreks work. http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-exyw6lye2ko/UFpJI1giRkI/AAAAAAAA45w/IIpfvQR_t2s/s1600/1.jpg
/me sips tea in the background of all this British related mess
"Barrowed" ?
They wheeled it?
Hehe
Why sip tea in the background, Serenity? Remember your nationality. Be PROUD of your teadrinkery!
Lasharus: If I was in the forground, I would be in the middle of an arguement
oh? did somebosy say tea?
Are we arguing?
/me hugs Gold_Demona
Hoai Pearly
Well, amusing as this is I have a couple things need doing so I shall be back shortly.
We are merely having a gentlemanly discussion.
ohai*
Alright cleverdick, debate
Yep. And they used it to borrow it as well.
Enjoy yourself then, Meanwhile.
I'll get back to playing King's Bounty.
Also, "clever dick" would be two words.
/me is gonna plaey WoW
hey Gold_Demona
How are ya Pearly? =)
I am great thank you darlin'
It was used for this. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT0hzJglYt0
Barbetos|AtWork, the poster credits Wrek in the description, but you'd have to ask Wrek if it was ok'd first
Well I don't want to use it
/me is lurking in the chat as usual. :D
Fucking lurker... I mean HAI!
:D
AJIsAwesome, does a good job *hugs AJIsAwesome* he is a good dear
Oh, thank you. :P
welcome
Awww, isn
t that cute. BUT ITS WRONG!
it's wrong? ;_;
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hspNaoxzNbs
I loved Two Stupid Dogs. :D
man, I remember that clip
That VA who did that was amazing.
I wonder if it was his normal voice.
Cause if he was acting and yelling like that. Damn. That is impressive.
back for a little bit
more nostalgia http://youtu.be/gOeo_zHTWB4
Speaking of nostalgia, anyone remember these commercials? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plTS1WarL94&feature=channel&list=UL
Johnny Bravo! =D
Dken2021: I miss these commercials. Add more depth to the cartoon world.
I loved the parking lot one
Anyone remember this one? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlbAGOIWuB8&feature=related
Aww, Dexter!~ ^^
OMG, I don't remember this! Aw man, poor Dexter! XD
How the hell did I miss this? I practically LIVED on Cartoon Network as a kid.
Or maybe i didn't miss it and just forgot about it. o_o
Anyone remember this commercial? :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IuC9OEH6HA&feature=related
Gold_Demona: You couldn't of missed it
I remember EVERY SINGLE video you're showing me
I probably just forgot about it
I do
I remembered this
I don't remember this... Why don't I remember this... This bothers me greatly... o_o
this was around in 1999 I think
Have some more commercials. :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&v=Pzth7hcueTs&NR=1
Gold_Demona: Dexter is too youg for girls though :D
*young
MadSurge: He's a cartoon. Cartoons are never too young. :P
Dexter was AWESOME
Tru dat Pearly
Gold_Demona: In 2012 though he is old enough :D
lol
He's still a cartoon. XD
That was all I watched at 5 or so
I don't remember how old I was when Dexter first came out.
Bart is still 10 years old
I was around 1 when Dexter was first aired
It REALLY bothers me that I don't remember these commercials...
It was '98, no?
Gold_Demona: besides, everyone knows cartoons love each other by doing pattycake :D
Serenity, yes
MadSurge: Exactly! XD
Patty cake patty cake!~
it was all hb cartoons and then others came on the station
Gold_Demona: another movie we should stream on Bronystate :D
Eeyup
I LOVE that movie
Made a place for all cartoons as if they are working
well time to head out, bbl
IKR?
yeah
Who Framed Roger Rabbit? My favorite movie from chilhood. That and Beetlejuice.
me too
Who Framed Roger Rabbit is one of those movies I can geek about forever. :3
CountDoofus: for me it was Blues Brothers instead of Beetlejuice :D
yeah
exactly
I have a book on the art of who framed roger rabbit
And I must say it's aged very well. It STILL looks good today.
Pinkie would feel at home in that movie :D
haha
Yep. :D
yeah
Pinkie would make SENSE in that movie
I picked up the DVD with bonus material. Watched it yesterday. SO MUCH NOSTALGIA!
Everything she does can be written off as "she's a toon"
Nice.
Gold_Demona: why, doesn't she in the series? :D
OK, spoof... "who framed Pinkie Pie
She would be the RULER of Toons. :D
needs to be made now
MadSurge: Oh yeah, you're absolutely right. Never mind. :D
AJIsAwesome: the pretty Princess of Parties :3
MadSurge: :D
MadSurge, you are a genius darlin
I AM THE LAW
That's Judge Dredd ;)
I know. :D
yeah
CountDoofus: he could be scary too
HE NEVER BLINKS IN THE WHOLE MOVIE
yeah
MARTY!
Gold_Demona: well of course, fake eyes
I still like him in the dream team
You wouldn't think that's much, but then you watch the scene where he's monologuing about his freeway plan. o_o
Gold_Demona: a full minute of wide open eyes?
Yeah
His eyes as a toon always freaked me out when I was a kid.
CountDoofus: Whose?
I think I can do that too if I concentrate :D
they probably made it digital, or something
Judge Doom's
Oh.
Me too CountDoofus
I was also freaked out when he got squashed. o_o
His sword eyes at the end of the show scared the ABSOLUTE CRAP out of me as a kid.
WHEN I KILLED YOUR BROTHER I TALKED LIKE (squeeks) this...
*film
AJIsAwesome: well, he's literally staring Eddie daggers :D
MadSurge: I know. :D
Oh my god
My internet is a joke today
Gold_Demona: good to see even younger folks know about good movies :)
Keeps going so so so so so slow
Some Trivia: Disney and Warner Bros. only agreed to the use of Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny if they got equally as much screen time.
IT'S TOO SLOW!
MadSurge: Younger? Who you talking about?
CountDoofus: Really? Wow. :D
Gold_Demona: those who are not you and me, dahling
yup
Roger Rabbit was a Disney movie that got permission from Warner Bros. to use their characters.
MadSurge: Ah lol
Gold_Demona: also great to see good animation is making a comeback
bye
As well as other companies, of course. Like Fleischer Studio's Betty Boop
Hang on, I got that trivia wrong. Here's the right one:
Since the movie was being made by Disney, Warner Brothers would only allow the use of their biggest toon stars, Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, if they got an equal amount of screen time as Disney's biggest stars, Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. Because of this, both sets of characters are always together in frame when on the screen.
Llyod is the man, he as in star trek 3 as Kruge
Right
haha camp nowhere
good movie
CountDoofus: the ducks' musical number :D
also merlock in ducktales the movie
I love the ducks together
You're disssspicable!
*spit everywhere*
Dueling pianos for the win
CountDoofus Wabbit season!
Be vewwy vewwy quiet. I'm hunting wabbits!
Pearly: He was Merlock!? :O
DUCK SEASON
Eeeh what's up doc
yes he was
Holy crap!
I have watched that movie forever
Meep meep.
he did an EXCELLENT voice for that
That was one I watched a billoin times growing up. :D
billion even
Gold_Demona: try to tell dr Doom and Merlock they were frozen today.
yeah
hahaha
lol
I WAS FROZEN TODAY
Dr. Doom?
Egh, Judge Doom :D
lol XD
yeah
Never seen that movie, just watched the Nostalgia Critic review.
Pretty much the only good thing out of it :D
watcht he whole movie
its good
IT'S AFTERBURNER!!
'cept maybe one of the big buff aliens talking like a 5 years old :D
I remember lloyd in taxi,, that was great
Oh crap, I should be in bed by now. Quick shower, food next, then sleep. Later, everypony, great talking about great movies :D

your niece sounds awesome
For some reason the people in my school have only just found out about gangnam style, I feel like such a hipster having heard about it ages ago :P
what was the fic about?
yeah
in mine there are always many people crowded at the lockers, because they re so thin, so there is no space... w8 a minute... there is - everywhere around... they just cannot make it better way?
yeah schools are crowded :/
if they make them for one class on slightly differend places, it wouldn't be so overcrowded, but it may be too complicated for them
yeah
lol does anyone draw in class?
no

Panda: in a nutshell, it was like this: they died of cuteness overload.
