11,01Smiley spam was a problem. So were all-caps.
11,01Hey Bronysith.
the police dont care
I think the music is unfitting.
Nah
really good thanks, how about you
:p
Put Pig Power in The House, dammit.
dat scenery
ahh look at that responsible driving :)
Anyone wanna hear a short, but somewhat amusing teacher story?
sure why not?
sure
(there will be politics)
sure CriticKitten
Nittany_Discord: thankfully, during fridays and normal streams the noob level is low; or at least its friendly patient noobs. So we have our normal qaulity conversation and entiertaining comments
yes drive safe kids
then car flips*
11,01Agreed.
Okay, so I'm grading exams in my remedial Algebra class.
true
CriticKitten: Grading exams? what
http://pastebin.com/Vy7KmK4m
destroy them all Shizuka
Nittany_Discord: Well at least we deal all the newbies and stuff one day a week during new epsiode period. At least things have calmed back down to the normal levels
teach them what it means to fear the streets
These tests were taken the day after elections. One kid wrote "OBAMA" on their test, presumably in celebration of the electoral results.
J_E_Smith71: agreed
So I grade this kid's test....and they got a 47% on it.
11,01Yeah, but we're going to go back to it next Friday and Saturday.
CriticKitten: I understand what you mean >_>
:(
Oooh GTA 4
?
I got a kick out of that. :3
CriticKitten: People really din't like our republican candiate and his rude comments
Ah, Lil' Jacob. He da man, ya seen?
Of course you can post links on here
T_T Thinking poor people, or thouse left without jobs are *all of them* lazy. fucking insenstive
to bad i cant understand him for crap
yup
Go ahead
as long as new horses are going out, the chat will be a goddamn dangerzone of text and spam on the 10 hour stretch
OMG DUDE U BRINGIN THE HOUSE DOWN CALM DOWN! DAT POOL GAME
T_T
CriticKitten must suck doing remedial classes, freakin students disruptive as ever
Heck, even the Gak spam has stopped as well...but I wonder if that'll be a running gag every week if the Hub does that barrage of ads again.
cuddly_kittehs: I just thought it hilarious how that kid's test came out. XD
Deacon: Remedial classes? What are thouse?
J_E_Smith71: You know you can't get enough gak
6Sorry,I had gone afk >.<
J_E_Smith71 hub always does lots of adds
even last season
i don't even know what gak is
it's some slime shit
^
like that fart putty
gak... what about gak? GAK! Sorry... it haunts me still...
alexxm a non-eutonian liquid used as a toy
By the way, anyone still play Assassin's Creed: Revelations multiplayer? Looking to farm some achievements :$
J_E_Smith71: I dont mind tradtional spam....as long as its just spam about friday night excitment, or a very revealing pony moment.
alexxm, look up yesterday's episodes with adds. By the end you will know gak.
gak vs trumoo
Buytoast: let's hope we get the +m every ten min. -_-
Gak is the new slime.
I just finished releasing another chapter on my HiE fic, so now I am VERY bored... so... HERE I AM
hell, i would've voted for a constant m+
yes,post a link?
Has there been released some new Mlp episodes yet?
Buytoast: Same here /)
Deacon: Oooo. Im that one student who ended up in one of thouse classes for reading class (I can read pretty fucking well, I just happen to have terrbile grammer skills T_T) and was the only student acuattly trying hard
i love how gak is what we all take away from the episode
MaxTheBrony You missed it :D
MaxTheBrony: The ep's on YouTube
killerpony7733: D:
mods need to make it where poeple can only post like once every 15 secs
What's streaming?
Deacon: and the only student realsed from the class within 2 mounths of it
that woudl help emensly
yup
:'( I missed Bronystate premiere :(
Like a Shizu
flutterfan99: That and Sombra
Gawd damn it MaxTheBrony
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtzQ5uoooeU&list=HL1352663677&feature=mh_lolz ps:warning
who here reads Fanfic?
All the cool kids were here
cuddly_kittehs well at least you were the one that actually cared
Pinkies: i do
J_E_Smith71: "bawww Sombra sucks" :|
flutterfan99, wat? I totally dig Twi's new dark magics
i'm new to bronystate what is sombra
flutterfan99: The villian in the new ep
the season 3 villan
I read them quite often, Pinkies_Imagination. Although I prefer to look for those I would enjoy, not others show me them.
the villian for s3
oh
and celestia using dark magic
...
KING SOMBRERO OF THE CHILLY NIP PLAINS IS THE GREATEST VILLAIN EVER
they mean Sombrero
other: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytzxDYLdC2c&feature=BFa&list=HL1352663677
Sombra feels like a fanfic villian :/ no offense to fan ficers
Twilight used Sharingan
Sombra De Amigo
I am not showing em, just wondering how many of em here like em
RainbowAsh: I can't wait where they go with the black magic thing :)
Oops
I be gone now , good night everybrony :)
seeya maxie
J_E_Smith71: King Sombrero/King Samba :D
stream?
MadSurge, me too, but realistically, it's even money it will never be mentioned again
gnight MaxTheBrony
Ha
bye max
aniderp1, yeah, pool.
I like the way King Sombra was presented he has a lot of potential and who doesn
i was in shower
bye MaxTheBrony
cleared the table
heu?
RainbowAsh: you sure? ;)
now i gotta get some clothes on.. going to park :>
night MaxTheBrony :)
Shizuka: So you heard of the heart secret?
doesn't like a looming evil during the entire episode
have fun when you get there aniderp
those 2 eps were probly mainly just there to show twi's lvling up to the next lvl and introduction to dark magic rly
Yeah some feel that Sombra was just supposed to be a looming threat and a force of nature than a normal villian
Heart secret?
naturesfury: I doubt that's the last we see of Sombra
i hope she works with luna
well he is a shadow, heck, that's what his name is in spanish
^
Or that Twilight's test was the focus of the ep and Sombra was just an obstacle in it
shizumobile: Yes, its at the Statue of Liberty. There's LITTERALLY a heart in there.
and lunas dark book in the end
well when sombra exploded at the end. u see his horn flying at the screen. which means he very well can come back
he's a horse that was turned into shadow by the queen horses
Oh that
MadSurge, MLP still is mostly slice of life. I ain't getting my hopes up for continuity. Except for that black book and next level of study, that was so large that they will obviously have to follow up on that.
I haven't unlocked islands yet
I didn't understand that video ._.
inb4 the book is never seen again
and its her diary or something
XD
08,01hehehe
I have finished GTA4 and also found the super fast hidden car on the third islan
d
Oh, Shizuka is playing GTA 4?
RainbowAsh: And one of the ads hinted about Twilight's "True Destiny" so they may be building that up this season
so what do you think the next level of study is
08,01so someone just offered us a kitten
although... a look in luna's diary
RainbowAsh: shorter season might mean more continuity though
08,01and if we decide to get it, i get to name it!
Good afternoon, everyone. How are you all today? :)
Sweet
Hi AJIsAwesome :)
AJIsAwesome: Hey there
is i t a girl or a boy?
cooafternoon AJIsAwesome
Hai AJIsAwesome
I'm fine AJIsAwesome
hello AJIsAwesome
hello
/me hugs thelonepony J_E_Smith71 Deacon Alchemist and andygrey :)
Hello AJIsAwesome! *glomps*
/me noms on AJIsAwesome :3
/me hugs MadSurge :)
i like this music
/me noms on MadSurge as well :3
everyone is so physical
6Neither do I >.<
name it The Dog
08,01well, i'm currently thinking either "Luna", "Dog", or "Unix"
6Hey :P
Ffffff
luna
Luna
ok
luna would be such a great name for a cat
Dog
Luna.
luna
But Unix is cool
Luna!
dog is best dog
I vote for Unix
I votes for Luna.
08,01CrystalPhoenix: all white
MadSurge, I feel a bit stifled to discuss this topic without going into spoiler terriotry, but I don't think they will mix up the basic formula for the series too much.
I vote for Linux
If it's a girl cat, then Luna (Plus you get the Sailor Moon reference...)
Duh
Then maybe Artiemis
Shizu sure likes the pool
:D
Diana
hello
luna
what about Opal?
if its white, opal makes sense, but if you dont like opal then we need another choice
08,01weeping_pegasi82: female
If it's black, and a girl, NAME IT LUNA!
It's white guys
It's white
08,01Deacon: oh god, you're right...
its a girl? name her LUNA
If its all white then Celestia
Opal
lol
What about zoidberg :D... I'm a horrible person
I agree with Artemis
then celestoa
Name it Celestia!
How about Celly?
celestia
yes you are Socks :3
Celestia!
08,01actually, i prefer the name Unix
name it Snow then
/me noms on Socks :3
CrystalPhoenix: Though it's a girl
6Hi :P
name it celestia
snow is a good name
Satuna it would be Opal because I think there is a black cat in Sailor Moon called Luna
/me noms back O.o
J_E_Smith71, oh and Artemis is a guy?
been a while since I watched Sailor Moon
So close
CrystalPhoenix: Well he had a male voice in the english dub
OPAL
YES
MadSurge, it would be awesome if they did that.
Opalescence
Name it Opal!
im never gonna get over the pinkie x minty thing
name it CELESTIA
Opal indeed
ok,you have see my video?
Opal!
Opalescence
http://sailormoon.wikia.com/wiki/Luna
Unix works too
Celestia, Opal, or Unix
CrystalPhoenix: Plus he and Luna had a kitten so yeah
thats what i said last time but iwas the only one :P
I now know what Luna's book was, btw. It's obviously Blithe Style
08,01my best firend is obsessed with stargate, and he has 2 cats called Sam and Jack
6I've seen a bit but I don't understand anything..
/me thinks about changing his nick to Opal and get tons of pings
its a girl and shes fully white name her CELESTIA
did that cop just hit that guy?
traduct to english
wooo car ride
Opalescence is a better name than celestia
Best driver ever
Friendship level up!
:D
who's streaming btw?
Shizuka

Chrysalis, I'm going with the simpsons on that one. In the list of Star Wars, Star Gate and Star Search, Star Gate is on the second place.
Best driver kills all the people
since we're talking about stones, how about the name Pearl?

I've travled a long way from the other side of my room to say this...

But I wasn't prepared for this!
Dark92Enigma: you hate it too? why?

Maybe you should use the taxi to skip these driving parts at the beginning of mission
I kind of liked the epicness of Season 3
well time for me to go to bed. cya guys
superretroworld: you didn't read my whole comment. i said ''i'm GLAD that i've seen it''
I do like the darker tone they took with it.
Record_Discord: I liked it too
night naturesfury
AlienWarhead: >gta >skip driving

Dark92Enigma: but youve gave it a 5.7/10

Hey flutterchu
flutterchu: hi

hey flutterchu
se 1 premiere 9.4/10 'a classic, only reason i wont rate it higher is because it was similar to dora the explorer

Hi, Good afternoon everyone
Probably even gak.
R34 GAK
I DARE YOU
The internet: Makes r34 on EVERYTHING! Including educational kid shows.
superretroworld: except for the fact that NONE of the mane 6 were talking to the audience, treating us like idiots, like Dora
13The discussion of rule 34 ends now.
^
an accurate depiciton of the events in a metaphorical way, if you ask me
I really wanted to know that, Dark_Horst...
HAVE YOU GUYS WATCHES THE SEASON 3 PREMIER?

Did anyone see King Sombra's horn fly off near the end of the premiere?
Yes
SuperBrony64: you drunk?
AJIsAwesome: i did
season 2 finale 9.2/10
AJIsAwesome i did
Yup. Pretty much setting the scene for season 3.
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352667220940.gif
SuperBrony64: aaand wrong ping
ofc
Poor Cadence
Bronysith Hahaha
I think that's possible evidence that Sombra may be alive.
wut.
Bronysith: derpiboo.ru/148641
AJIsAwesome: Wait what?
http://www.wilhelmscream.net/ What it says on the label
jojoyasmin: Did you not see the horn fly off near the end?
AJIsAwesome WHAAAA--- are you serious? :)
season 3 premiere 8.9/10
Yeah, and since the horn plants evil...
AJIsAwesome i did.....that means he'll get back?
I'm assuming that all the villians will be MORE EVIL
Muh'fuckuh
AJIsAwesome: No! This could mean a lot of things...
Turns out I had another stream video on another tab
Also, couldn't there be a relation between NMM and Sombra?
Record_Discord: EEEEEEVIIIIIL!
Deleted it. Now its kind of clean
Dark_Horst Now that would be hilarious
EVIL? EEEEEEEEVIIILLLLL!
So basically, is he comes back, hopefully they could give us more info about him.
The night...will last...forever!
well, season 3 has just started, and i'm glad i started it with you guys
AJIsAwesome: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/49bf8e205037146bb2dddb7a59f03a51.png Samurai Applejack :D
EEEEEEEVIL! EVIL EVIL EVIL! EEEEEEEVIL!
E.V.I.L = Every Villain Is Lemons
shitlord
Remember that episode
MadSurge: lol neat
Twilight's going to a higher level of study, she and Celestia know dark magic, and that dark bok at the end is very interesting.
jojoyasmin we hope, and remember, theres still the comics
lol
FAIL
*book
HAHA
Dat grenade
AJIsAwesome....i smell a story-arc!
Daaaaamn, son!
Oh yeah
what...
did that guy die right behind you
Pretty much
Also, did anyone see Luna's behavior whenever they talked about Sombra?
/me AJIsAwesome (cue Indiana Jones theme)
back
LOL
DUN DUN DUN DUN
DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN
DUH DUH DUH DUH
:D
DUNDADA
DUNDADADADADADADADA
Mmk, Ill stop
Sombra is the origami killer
Hmm. They could have not shown the villain very much on purpose then.
11,01Please do.
is everyone done spamming...........................it..............
No problem
AJIsAwesome I'm still more interested in the whole rumor about what's gonna happen with twi during this season.
AJIsAwesome: she ignored twilight alot too
:$
I am rather glad that we're getting back to Twilight. We've already spread out the characters and explained a lot, I really want some cool story arcs
AJIsAwesome Luna wasn't pleased by the end of the episode
Then who was book
Mane six go to mane hatten because Apple jack's Family?
True bu the ultimate destiny seems like a non foreshadowed cop out
TROctavia: DAMMIT NO NO ONE'S DONE TALKING ABOUT IT
........
AJIsAwesome i even said ''LUNA IS NOT PLEASED'' possible meme?
Verspa: dat spoilers
King Sombra returns in the finale as a Gak pony with his Gak minions
i need to calm down
No it isnt
No moar gak
Its an idea
plz
hehe
superretroworld: Yeah, that was interesting. I'm pretty sure that Luna knows that Celestia can use dark magic, and eventually Twilight would've too. Maybe Sombra's dark magic helped Luna become NMM?
Wait, Hasbro is planning that?
idk
Man, this whole dark magic thing, I'm looking forward to it
Also, what's interesting is what Celestia and Twilight look like when they perform dark magic.
http://i.imgur.com/47AkI.gif
AJIsAwesome: AWSOME PLOT TWIST
AJIsAwesome....that would be the BEST. TWIST. EVER.
You know, I'm hyped again!
Maybe Trixie dark magic?
Or Discord?
:|
They take on a similar appearance to King Sombra. Hmm......
BITCH YOU ARE RUNNING OUT OF AMMO
That'd be awesome :D
Verspa: You heard the man
I never did like this mission
whoa
So many screwy textures
AJIsAwesome: hmm maybe,and w/ Sombra's horn maybe he'll offer Trixie dark magic and kinda control her,like what Ansem did to Riku in KH as an example
I can't belive they are bringing back thee embodyment of choas after what he has relatively jut done to ponyville
Record_Discord: Discord would looks like something straight out of hell if he used dark magic.
I want to play GTA IV. But my fuckin driver isnt so perfect...
I don't wanna wait! :'(
This game just reminds me of why I don't do missions.
VenHur: Yes. Yes he would.
Record_Discord: are you Petrified_Discord?
whats on the stream now?
inb4 cousin, wanna go bowling ?
Go pick her up and then speed around town
Spy? /hidesw
Crash your car
I still have hope for this season.
superretroworld: I am not.
Didnt play the game, only the beggining. SO I have no idea what the fuck happens
anyone got a link to the premiere in 1080p on youtube?
And pick up a hooker
GTA4
Yay
It was awesome.
Dark_Horst: check EQD
is*
...But yeah, I always wondered what Twilight and Celestia would looks like if they used too much dark magic...
And I mean TOO much.
Oh man, that'd be awesome
AlienWarhead: doing that, but they've been quite busy posting it seems
Maybe dark magic could be corruptive?
I have a very sterio typical italian-like accent.
I think it could be
*stereo
Also guys, I might have a pony problem. I found a guy who is doing a workshop for Natural Selection 2. Welll... He made a bunch of pony related stuff. I downloaded all of it.
Is that bad?
AJIsAwesome: Something's outta' Metroid Prime 3's Hyper Mode?
Dark_Horst: it should be near the top
in case you ever get bored guys... amaizingness http://wim.pentastudios.net/index.php?gamepage=play
Alchemist: hell no, found it at the bottom of the second page
Celestia used dark magic 1 thousand years ago to banish Luna and make every pony agree to her dictatorship
Dont worry. Everytime I am able to download anything pony related, I download it
*ali
Guise, as said by VenHur, Discord with dark magic would look like something out of hell
brooklyn bridge~
AlienWarhead:
Lunac: I doubt that.
GAH
FUCK MY TYPING
It's possible though
bored or what? Shizu Shenanigans? NEVER :|
i walk over that bridge fairly often it seems
AlienWarhead: well yeah, second page , bottom. lots of posts
Record_Discord: Like the giant Discord from the .MOV series?
The light side of the force is neve as powerful as to physically move someone innto space
I'm going to get photoshop and shop in evil eyes over Discords eyes. Then freak out.
Look at that bitch run
lol

SHES A SPY
THE HOOKER IS A SPY

I'm also glad they focused on characters like AJ, Rarity and Spike. They even brought back Shining and Cadence, so technically they're not one shot characters anymore.
Suuuure

SHE DID MEANT IT

She;'s an attractive female cop in Liberty city she has to run otherwise she;s as good as dead
Cluckin' Bell

Also, the pun with AJ and Rarity was pretty funny. :D

Chrys, Celestia AND Luna had no chance
Vordox, I cannot deny that he caught my interest
*shoots gunny off*
back again.......major computer derp
hi Domo
Discord is the only one that could take on his powerlevel :P
so i turned it off
wb Dark92Engima
O_O
His powerlevel?
Yes
Lunac, no RP :3
Over 9000!
hello o3o
guny no cannibalism
Had to make the joke. Actually, no I didn't. But still, I digress.
hi pony_460783
THe Princesses had no chance again Sombra, Chrys had little power to begin with.
ello pony_460783
Discord is probably the only one more stronger powerwise then Sombra.
Alright. Looks like I'm going to use http://www.ehow.com/how_11415978_remove-gak-carpet.html for my role playing.
But I don't know HOW far.
I mean what now we have Jealousy, Boredom, Greed?
and now Hate with Sombra
we dont really know sombras power
pony_460783! How are you?
What I do like about Sombra is the fact that he has a regenerating horn. It makes you wonder if he's been secretly placing those around Equestria.
CrimsonPhoenix: I'd say it's more GREED then Hate for Sombra
Also, hi pony_460783. :)
Vordox, HIS POWER is hate
CrimsonPhoenix: How?
Hate is his essence
CrimsonPhoenix: I thought it was Greed, cause that'shis persona from the episode

CrimsonPhoenix: Aaand how does that prove that Sombra had anything with Hate to do?
MadSurge: see my response a comment above you
Princess Cadance= pony Diana?
If anything, I'd say he's just greed
Dark92Enigma: I agree then :3
she keeps canned water...in a tub?

Kazahstan is the best country in the world
Luna= Queen Victoira and Darth vader
CANNED WATER ON A TUB?

Vordox: so?

I've got 2 hours on photoshop now!
Other countries are ruled by little girls
And then we have Rainbow Discord. XD
What's thissss?
Vordox: :D
I hope the next villian is not black
08,01discord was still my favourite villain
That's RACIST
HOLY CRAP
Insane GREED
08,01but i'd still hug NMM
~deep on bell wonder de-eep on bell wonder~
Racist is a spy
GAK
And yes, he was pretty cool. Although Sombra may be making a return.
WIth his odd talk... :P
Inb4 USE THE FORCE
08,01special adult hug.
What needs to be revealing?
i just realized, chrysails is the only villan IN THE WHOLE SHOW who sang a song
DeathStar, :D
flutterchu: Pretty much :P
But guys...
There's a reason why Sombra is awesome
who plays the MLP game?
That VERY few notice
Does a villain NEED a song?
flutterchu: What about... um... the one bad guy...
Thousands of them
Why I love Sombra so MUCH
AJIsAwesome: indeed
..I don't remember Discord having a song
AJIsAwesome Most villains usually do it usually makes them even more memorable
ill get the button: http://inception.davepedu.com/
Record_Discord: nope........thelivingtombstone made that song...it's a fan song silly kitty

okay for those who play the game add me: squallken1
Hey domo
That's the thing with Sombra too, that's unique, he had VERY little Speech, compared to EVERY OTHER villian
"The artist is never at fault! Rather, it's obviously the selfish other people who are to blame!"
He made shit done :P
I am back!
go add, squallken1 to your gameloft

13why is it so hard to behave..
Somebody to love is best queen song

Shizuka: Trolls. Or People been raised to become morons
Vordox: hoenn elite four
Bohemian Rhapsody -cough-
stream of the stream of the stream
Shizuka: mahms spaghetti
theyre bronies
Dunno. If I can do it, then they have no excuse. >.>
Hey YO wuts up everypony:) yay Domo stream
cachi01: Aha, that's why it's so familiar...
Shizuka Because it requires someone to actually think before they act.
it's the Elite Four theme of Ruby/Sapphire
Vordox: Or both :3
Anybody speak Fancy lang ^^'
the interenet gives that air of anonimousity
Hi scout19_tf2 :)
and when you give that out
Can we make requests for songs? Can we do that?
people will revert to being dicks
Hi, scout19_tf2. :)
What you mean Shizuka? I have been afk
it's the nature of having no permanent consequences to your own self
Record_Discord depends if said person has those songs I guess
To be honest, I would have expected it recently as new people come to the chat for the new episodes and don't understand that there are rules :P
TheFrenchBrony: maybe, but refrain from doing so. This is an english speaking chat
Oh, so no youtube songs then... :/
I was going to request Bohemian Rhapsody.
i just went to hot topic and loaded up on pomy shirts:)
only if streamer is taking requests
GUYS
*pony

Arcane: I accidentally found a meetup when I took a trip to orlando.
Mod
My Ears
I knooow
Kawaii_icybeauti I wish that happened to me more often
so was the jimmies one
Jimmies?
Anyone know where to get good MLP-centered t-shirts in the UK? Preferably with a range of obviousness, I'd like to be able to wear one in public without getting stared at all the time. :P
05well yeah but i didnt remember how the site looked
ah the jimmies
that have been rustled
Jimmies?
I still think my favourite part of BronyState.
Has to be Battlefield Leverage
Also, we need get Vivi a new hard drive
man that stupid screamer incident *grumble grumble* ow
SafariMonkey: WeLoveFine is the place to go
Arcane: I haven't found one since though.....I did find out about a group form my mom's home coutnry, and they met in a place that we go to often....
and do another speed speed racer
So, that's what DCD looked like...huh.
I liked the Konami code on Bronystate 1.0
Sketch_Toku_Brony: wut?
05speaking of bronystate dari, when will you get off your arse and make the movable windows again?
WHO WANTS TO START A FUND TO GET VI A NEW HDD?
Deacon: Hah
05i keed i keed i wub whu
Kawaii_icybeauti where are you from?
Arcane: NY
seriously how much is a decent HD?
Kawaii_icybeauti: murrica!
Kawaii_icybeauti O_O Google harder I see alot of stuff in NY
I completely forgot
I hear terabyte hard drives are cheap.
Murrica, land of the obese!
08,01that's quite easy to do
dat Ponies47 :3
Hey everypony
otakon cheapest I remember is for $50, and it was for probably a 100GB
08,01it's just some jquery between the embeds and wordpress
Hi Ponies47 :)
Hai Ponies47 :)
hi, Ponies47. :)
Btw, bronycon is in baltimore.....Damn....
Hi Ponies47
cachi01 some idiot posted a screamer earlier on stream,he's banned thankfully but it spooked alot of us and it really hurt my ears -_- still kinda hurt...
05harddrives
05hmm
*baltimare....
hi Ponies47 :)
Deacon: so it would be doable?
Kawaii_icybeauti no no just look for local meet ups silleh
05i think they are still expensive as buck csaue of the whole taiwan thingy
08,01in fact, i think movable windows would be about... no more than 10 lines of code?
05but it might beb etter now than last year
Arcane: I'll go hunting later.
Deacon: you got ripped off. hard
I've seen a terabyte hard drive go for about $150 ish, I think.
Sketch_Toku_Brony: damn someone was taking requests or was it a link?
Sketch_Toku_Brony: i hope you feel better, i know that feel -_-
AJIsAwesome: same here
AJIsAwesome: 100 actually
Deacon: i bought a terrabyte external drive for 70 bucks
yeah same here thelonepony
cachi01: Wow.
Dark_Horst It was a price I remmember seeing somweherre
Yeah, there are also terabyte usb drives and external drives as well.
Deacon: still hoplessly hoverpriced
cachi01: nah the guy just posted it
0,14I got a 2TB HDD for like $100 recently
mmhmm
SaxyPretender: wow nice
05the most expensive HD i can get here in sweden off my computer parts deliverer is 3TB and it costs 175 dollars
If I did decide to go, my dad would force me to go visit my horrible cousin who lives in virgina.....decisions decisions...
Wow. That a good dal
deal
Deacon: one thing to rmember: data storgae is cheap as fuck nowadays
ah hey 2BFs play RE6 :D
also, did Domo's stream go bye-bye?
i think so
yeah Deacon it did
OKAY!
so we've established that a new HDD for Vi is NOT out of our league
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiz95K1ngiI&feature=g-all-u the following preview has been approved for YOUR ASS
even Brokestate Regulars like myself can contribute

Thanks, CrimsonPhoenix. :)
05thankfully that will change with the WiiU
Wrek: they're fine!
posted at 12:00 EST
Wrek: also considering that so many games use the Unreal 3 engine which has the same capabilities on ANY platform regardless
cachi01: well, there are these three http://derpiboo.ru/148304?scope=scpe90e07186f66e6f6e002d3d1bdc9b2f53c819eebe http://derpiboo.ru/148062?scope=scpe90e07186f66e6f6e002d3d1bdc9b2f53c819eebe http://derpiboo.ru/148161?scope=scpe90e07186f66e6f6e002d3d1bdc9b2f53c819eebe

Exploding GAK
http://cheezburger.com/6200401920
cachi01: i totally recommend it,plus to draw a weapon like an AK ya push down on the dpad which is good since the comsole ver's way to draw weapons is to hold square and can be tricky since its pressure sensitive and pushing too hard will fire it where as down on dpad on Vita pulls it out BUT not fire till ya push square :)
/me How's everypony doing?
Good. How about you, Blue_Leaf? :)
Going to sleep

xtremetoxicguy its a good stuck in your head

Homestuck.
Tirek from the G1 Premiere was more fleshed out and menacing
so, Sombra, greatest villian, or greaterest villian?
I see what they were TRYING to do with Sombra
make something just coldly evil
xtremetoxicguy I wish that song was longer
fluttershy...two legs....now cannon
Deacon: Most Evil I say
Out of all
brb
I'm saying this now
OH MY CELESTIA I JUST SAW WRECK IT RALPH! IT WAS AWESOME!
Deacon: what about shittiest villain
his design's cool though...

DONT TELL ME WHAT HAPPENS
Sombrero will be a fan favorite at the end of season 3
i watched that movie to
kidzrul732: oreo. oreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeo
kidzrul734 : LUCKY.
screencap my words if you must
Discord is best baddie
yeah he is
maybe sombra will come back...and then talk
but he will become a fan favorite
Deacon: Nightmare Moon was vengeance, Discord was just trying to make his own, Chrys needed love to live, and then we have King Sombra.. He just WANTED EVERYTHING, and would do ANYTHING to do it
I can sense it
CrimsonPhoenix: if they put him in later episodes and work on him, than yeah
and am i the only one who thinks there is NO point to the GAK jokes!
yeah sombra must come back in season finale
GAK is best pony
xtremetoxicguy: you and everyone else here

11,01Hi otakon.

We got music and sound and graphics! Some minor lag but hey, it's stream :P
what game is that?
mmhmm
TOO MANY DINOSAURS
i dont have any first person shooter games.....i beleve that's why my XBOOX 360 is very dusty
That shotgun sound was used in the mod Desert Combat for Battlefield 1942...
:D
Dark_Horst: primal carnage

Nittany_Discord went nom nom nom
oh god! T REXY
0,14Primal Carnage reminds me of Bloody Roar for some reason
again wow XD
SaxyPretender: <3 But Bloody Roar is a game with beasts. :P
Or as I like to called it: "Team Fortress 2: Primal Edition"
SaxyPretender: YES,SO awesome!
so whats this game about
Nitt, you need to stop getting eaten by that TRex
0,14I dunno, the title does
SaxyPretender: That's cause the third in the series was Primal Carnage
wasn't there a game similar to this?
SaxyPretender: Bloody Roar?! Ohh man, that game brings back memories!
GAK GAK GAK
SaxyPretender: Bloody Roar: Primal Fury
NO >I
XylemTube: pls go
>:I*
so the dinosaurs get to call in airstrikes right?
and drop tatical dinosaur nukes
Come on Nitt! It's just DINOSAURS
what cashieoweone said >:I
Buytoast: No, they play it
Buytoast: just when they have a 14 killstreak
cachi01: no thanks
wut am i watching
SaxyPretender: The game is played like an usual beat-em-ups, but you can transforms into an ANTHRO!
...That's...fucking sweet.
VenHur: i thought it was fighting game?
Jurassic Park The FPS
Buytoast: Velociraptor = Like Hunters, they pounce you die if you don't get out, then we have the smaller Veli's, that's just annoying but fast, Then we have Pteradon, flying once, can't take hits, but they can grab you and lift you up in air and insta kill you, And then T Rex, the BIG TANK
Oh yeah, a fighting game.
Wtf is he playing? Just got here so.
a gentle creature, the tyrannosaures rocks will only attack is threateded with a shiny stick or with anything resembleing newman from seinfeld

VenHur: yar har

I LOVE the music!
afternoon everyone
:O oh wait! DINO CRISIS on PS1 :D
Hi Mutterguy :)
...FUCK!
Is your computer lagging, Nittany_Discord ?
hi Mutterguy :)
Shizuka: You're gonna join?
Jurassic Park meets Resident Evil :D
Oh hai TRex
No, no, it's a different game, it's Primal Carnage.
Good news: Feature to play five dinosaurs. Your choice.
THAT NET IS SO OVERPOWERED
LOL FAIL DEATH
Nittany_Discord: If you hit the dino and net htem, and you hit them with your knife melee = Insta kill :P
Bad news: The game isn't free, gotta' pay 14 dollars.
VenHur: SO?! WORTH IT
Or you can pirate the game.
I saw this game on Steam. I didn't expect anyone to care, though
And here we have the cause
VenHur: YAR HAR
Thanks VenHur and Verspa, you're fucking up the game market. ._.
I know ._.
even more?
You and the other millions of players
If I see a game that gives me enjoyment, even for 4-5 hours or more, I'll pay any amount to help the people who produced it
Why, cause they put their all into it.
Well, If I have money, I would pay
But, well, my parents dont give me any money.
Verspa: It's just 14 dollars. You can afford that. :P
If you want a free version of this, You had TF2...just...no dinosaur class... =C
http://cristgaming.com/pirate.swf
Sorry. Got 0.
cachi01: lol
cachi01: No non image linking during stream
Isn't pirating a game's illegal?
NET HIM!
Yeah
Nom
Vordox: its a swf :I that counts as an image
You just got NOMMED
But, downloading music is also illigle
right?
...
cachi01: I hear music, don't I?
Limewire? Everyone who pirates the game uses Pirate Bay now :D
Visuals, and Music.Whoo, you won, Nittany_Discord O.o
SWF is more like a video. Even if it's a vector flash
cachi01: That counts as a non image link :P
11,01We actually lost. It's a bug.
/me goes to the smae corner
shame*
Nittany_Discord: Lawl, newly released game
this half life game is pretty nice
Is it a dinaosaur bug? :O
/me eats the game corner
0h, r3a11y?
Nittany_Discord: ANYWAY NTIT½ If you net a dino and hit it with your knife = Insta kills
and how can you lose, you're shooting things the size of houses
Fun fact: good bye was originally god bye which was originally god be with you.....cool huh?

SaxyPretender: Flame Thrower?
...I am confuse

this game seems intresting is it still in the beta
POOOUNCEEEE!
which makes a lot of sense, actually
alexxm: It just got released.
it's on steam too
Like 12 days ago
Dark_Horst: The graphic and animation is top notch in this game

Suddenly TRex, "Hai"Wazzup""Nomming"Cool"

Vordox: the graphics.... naw, not really. but the animation cycles for the dinosaurs are surprisingly good
Dark_Horst: It's on lower quality to be able to be streamed, Dark
Vordox: i know what a stream does
Dark_Horst: Unless you have the game on your own and maxed
:P
hmm
i'm getting ideas
asymetric tf2
I'm scared now. My cat, who loves my dad, just left a few holes in his hand. D:
Vordox: but if you want to say top notch graphics, you'll have to mention bf3 and crysis first
SHOOT HER
Yeah, but shitty on PC
Blue_Leaf: D:
If, well, you have a shitty PC
Dark_Horst: There's Top Notch Graphic, then we have the Hipster graphics. :P
What game is this?
Primal Carnage
gogogogogo
Vordox: the hell is hipster graphic?
Oh shit, double TRex in one area
this reminds me of Turok
Dark_Horst: "Let's use the highest Tech for graphics"
thelonepony: IKNOW. I'm scared to go to sleep now, fearing my cat will eat my face.
lol
About some US base expiriment that got fucked up so badly taht they had to send in illigal drug mercenaries to the place
I prefer Realism game. :P
ohhhhhh
11,01Lag caused that last suicide.
Vordox: crysis 1 ran on my middle class pc from 2 years ago just fine
winnn
so is this supposed to be a jurassic park game that lost the licesance but they were too far ahead in programming it?
There is a few realism game
Nittany_Discord, seems legit
Not GTA, its kind of Realism
Blue_Leaf: no, i'm scared what will your father do to your cat D:
No, it's Primal Carnage.
The problem is
Vordox: also, you should probably look up the meaning of "hipster" again
fun > realism
Dark_Horst: All I am saying, I say he game is top notch, for what it is
Just 1 guy.
Phase4: I'm more of a fun guy
/me hardly understands what i hipster is
:3
D:

Agreed thelonepony
/me repsawns
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
cachi01: Not him i meant the others :I
dont worry about the stupid gak, guys. it's not that big a deal either way
the reaction to the stimulus was an interesting one
All those screams. <3
I ain't a noob.
fimfiction chat ignored me when i said it
Phase4: So Phase.. :P
TROctavia: but it IS annoying
gak?
Vordox, busy atm, setting something up while studying
some puddy from the 90's
i've got magnets to learn about
i only said it once to test for reactions
Phase4: Alrighty
I know thelonepony, but let them have their gak so that they can get it out of their system
Phase4: magnets how do they work
TROctavia: Good idea :3
i will not say it again today on this chat
You know, comic book characters don't exist, Spider-Man doesn't even exist either because it's fantasy, right?
LOLS
wait
DINOS MOVING IN A PACK
GG
cowvarkian, i kinda know, and they are wierd
spiderman isnt real?
WHAT?
TROctavia: But i have a Internet shotgunjust in case >:I
I'VE BEEN LIVING A LIE
:D
shotgun.\, jsut*
cachi01: are you spiderman?
lol. save your ammo
what game is this?
TROctavia: No :I
what game is this
thelonepony: in case of gak?
/me grabs shotgun :I
Okay, fine then :\
magnets work on the principle of the theory or electromagnetism
>_>
I'm going to sum it up in one word, Spider-Man is not real! Not even if he sneaks up on me!
Nittany_Discord: That map was unfair :P
/me is a smartflank
cowvarkian: no but i've been training myself in the spider ways D:
<,<
there we are
gakvarkian: if it last to long than yeah
/me reloads shotgun :I
for now....
:I
ponies don't have shotguns
no fingers
>.>
TREX
Right behind you
Jageman: Yes i do have fingers >_>
<_<
>_>
NiTT VS TREX WHO WINS
Oh..
then you are not a pony
unless you have biomechanical grafts
Jageman: i am a pony :I
>_>
<_<
<--- If this was real...
Jageman pls theres a pony playing piano in the gala
Think about it, Guns doesn't work THAT well against those sizes...
Jageman: if they can play piano
Shouldn't nickle be "nickel" in that?
Suddenly, human was lower on the eating order :P
they can shoot a shotgun
Vordox: It will be awesome /)'3'(\
the pony pianos have larger keys
thelonepony: I prefer living not so scaredly .P
NITT PONEY FOR PRESIDENT
for their hoves
But still Jageman, they hit chordal accompaniments
LOL
"AYE YOU WANNA BITE!"
Vordox: only in remote islands :P
because they are not playing anything
D:
thelonepony: Inb4 Dino Civilization
the music departemt is adding the sound
wat
OH FECK TREX
Don't break the 4th wall
Nitt WON!
they have to handle it on their own
there is no 4th wall
hell if there was an island i'll have tom and wilson with me :P
there never was
I suppose its a creative liberty
maybe there is a 4th wall
lets ask the audience
lol
/me noms on Ipad
If you're watching this, leave a comment below and say if you think there's a 4th wall!
/me nom nom nom nom nom nom
there is no 4th wall
Nitt's getting better.
but there is a door there
and pinkie has the key
What door?
And yet, what key?
The door to the universe
Jageman: dont you have a reading class that teaches you anything?
i know the concept of the 4th wall
because my Bitch Teacher taught me Alot of stuff
:I
this show does not have one
pinkie pie broken before the first episode aired
How do you explain
havent you seen Pinkie pie grab a Check mark?
the end of one of the episodes where pinkie
stretches the closing frame
and says Hey, Im not done yet! or something to that effect
she's acknowledging an audience
what's the 4th wall?
...
okay now i can assume your in Middle school flutterchu :I
flutterchu: the barrier between fiction and reality iirc
^
if a house has only 3 walls, is it a house?
flutterchu: the screen that divides the show from the audience
thelonepony: nope......
TROctavia: ''Hey, that's what i said''
Jageman: As long as you acknowledge it as one, then yes.
Dark92Enigma: Is that what she says?
the barrier that normally exists between the charaters and the audience does not exist for this show in the same way as other shows
flutterchu: for example: in mgs psycho mantis checks your save datas from your ps2 memory card and starts making puns about those games
TROctavia: yes
its less of a barrier and more of a door
cachi01: ooooooooh...i get it now
think about it
Game Grumps faced the dread Silver
It's no use!
TAKE THIS
It's no use
Are we arguing about the shape and function of a theoretical concept
we the fans have named how many ponies
How about this?
It's no use!
yes
How about this?
Jageman: over 9000?
not yey
*yet
how do you do that
i used to be an arrow like you
I know what youre trying to say, Jageman, but i feel that there is both a wall and a door
but then i took an adventurer knee
gak
no
http://i.imgur.com/47AkI.gif
yes
-_-
an acceptable compromise
a 4th wall with a door in it
im fine with that idea
and windows so we can watch, of course
mhm
/me dreams of a jurrasic period Equestria.
lol
and im not as dumb as shit......
whats the point in having a door without a wall?

https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xnTKnpKWaxo/UKAE6_BL0JI/AAAAAAAALj8/ZWU6_1hh_XE/s450/MLPgak.png it was his plan all along
Nittany_Discord: What's the server is called?

Anyone wanna play?
otakon: for any other pony, i agree
btw anyone else noticed this? http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/mlp/images/thumb/9/9d/King_Sombra_losses_horn.png/640px-King_Sombra_losses_horn.png

TROctavia: its just a joke
Family Guy has gone on for 180 episodes too long
that everyone tells
Buytoast: simpsons for 500
SaxyPretender, what do you meen? cats are awesome
J_E_Smith71: dafuq is a family guy :P
i heard a rumor that disney would buy out mlp...i hope not :|
or wants to anyway
TROctavia: Disney would NEVER do that, they did a good job with Pixar and Marvel, there's NO way they can screws up Star Wars or Indiana Jones.
0,14cats aren't awesome when they break things ;_____;
does anyone else think that king sombra was written to troll the older fanbase?
Sketch_Toku_Brony: xD hasbro wont sell mlp
Sketch_Toku_Brony: its printing money
^
11,01Trixie needs nerfing.
VenHur: I know. I'm the biggest Disney Parks nerd
cachi01: yeah :D
close enough
I have full faith in disney
does anyone else think that king sombra was written to troll the older fanbase?
cachi01: or rather http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/8106/ :D
he wasn't, now stop asking
Who is streaming?
Sketch_Toku_Brony: YEAH :D
But yeah, since the buying, I GUESS that's means they will put Indiana Jones and Star Wars characters as meet and greets...
Buytoast: sorry :(
...But screw that.
i think king sombra written to promote some gak
nope
pony_4253: -_-'
VenHur: They've had both of those for many years
Star Tours came out in the 80's i believe, and anaheim has an indiana jones ride
pony_4253: no, just.... no
/me is readying his shotgun :I
oh nevermind. turns out the charger got disconnected ._.
70's- 80's was star wars i think
Whoa hey
This is one of those pony servers.
thelonepony: try the buckshot, trolls move fast
Ah. Wiki says '87 was the debut of Star Tours in disneyland
okay :I
Ohia

Jageman: Not a bad idea to practice
Ive never played TF2, or any other 1st person shooter, ever
I wish i had TF2, but computers and Shit :I
..yet I've gone shooting with my uncle with automatics
thelonepony: i would rather practice it the computer than make a foal of myself
TF2 in the end, isn't the king of first persons.
/me notes that people forget about UT2004 quickly
Jageman: well, practice by yourself then
but UT2004's not f2p :\
k
and increase it :I
The demo is! :D
lol
if it was, i'd play it a lot more and talk about it
L3
:3*
srsly, i want UT to be f2p
it's a lot faster game!
i havent played UT.
And you can carry all weps.
Ut2005?
ut2004*
And engage in reckless driving!
UT = unreal tournaent right?
Yesh

Or play UT2003 demo.
Before y'all's's time it was...
no demos, i want full game to be f2p
i bought the orange box a long time ago, played everything but tf2
Did you know, at one point, you held the world record for being the youngest person alive?
tf2 for consoles sucks
Jageman: Console version?
i have orange box console version
Eddmario: yes
Jageman: Don't then. TF2 on that version sucks.
Eddmario: no sorry pc version
Nittany Tiger? :o
Eddmario: my brain is work not
Jageman: Oh, in that case play it. The PC/Mac version is the best version
lol mac
just be sure to have one hell of a comp to play it
pc is free download right
this comp with dual core 3.6 ghz has trouble playing it, always slow
it is now
TF2 is f2p forever

Darkts3|Trader|Snipe: team fortress 2
plot of things<_<>_>
Thats an interesting idea
am i the only one who does not understand why the g meme stuck
Jageman: lots of g ads during S3
i was there
here actually
because if you repeat something enough times people will mimic it
pony_4253: have you read the rules yet?
yep
and the FAQ?
There were four commercials for it in a row at one point
TROctavia: yeah i remember lol
repitition could not have been the only reason

And so does cola!

Oh yea I rember the gyrobowl from movie night he pulled the photo up before movie night started
raise your hoof if you have headphones on
imagine all the places you can eat chili in
/me raises hoof/paw
Am I the only one who thought TF2 bots were really really bad?
*raises hoof* O-o
Stary: was it coffee, or hot chocolate, which was established
Jageman: The ads for it played like the gak ads did during S1.
we are humans
we have hands
*raises hoof*
/me raises hoof
most likely
Jageman: Coffee, I'm sure of it XD
*Raises hoof*
0,14I have hands because I am a man
raises hoof
0,14A MANLY MAN THAT PUNCHES THINGS
Stary: was it mentioned by name?
the last thing i punched i had to throw out
SaxyPretender: intresting...
you dont need to punch things to be manly
SaxyPretender: would you fight a Bear with your fist? :3
i miss that desk chair
SaxyPretender: Yeaaaayughhhh! XD
SaxyPretender: To be fully manly, you must punch a global war in the face. With no gloves on.
Stary: i am just looking for conformation for my head canon
YEAAAAAAAH!!!!!
Jageman: No, just saw it
0,14I would, thelonepony, and then I would eat its paw
dang
0,14because I've heard bear paw is delicious

barepaw |D
0,14Kurra, I've done that
u guys r rite egypt is shitty
....I just realized something that would totally redeem King Sombre.
So you are like Fluttershy with the bear:[
Stary: i will look at the episode and double check
SaxyPretender: this night, it is fulfilling
well then, come ate me bra
SaxyPretender You also have an opportunity to express your right to bear arms
Jageman: Okay, :)
0,14hey, thelonepony, ARE YOU OKAY?
Okay what can we punch in the face to be manly?
Stary: also, why were foals drinking coffee?
girls like sombras horn
o.O
Punch ship armor in the face
Jageman: *shrugs*
SaxyPretender: oh u :D
0,14:3
Jageman: They like coffee?
No, I mean, the easiest way to redeem the character: it's Nobunaga ponified.
Wake the statue of Abe Lincoln in DC, and thenpunch him in the face, and then fight his 16-foot-tall marble form.
INSTANT redemption.
:kickcount thelonepony

likeaboss: what difficulty?
twilight_sprinkle: Smart man you are :I
Some people are so sore over Gak. I don't get it, its a stupid meme, but don't let it get to ya
brb food
normal and it was very sad cahi01
Kandarihu: Bitch please
don't spoil it for me I just spent my money on AC3
Kandarihu: but thats pretty awesome
You put a gyro bowl ina gyro bowl and you make a portal to Equestria.
:D
Kandarihu: Herasy
likeaboss: normal? im completing it on legendary with all terminals :) DONT SPOIL PLS :D
That's the real reason it was advertised during S1.
My little pony: Portal 2
11,01Must get gyro bowns.
must get them now
gyro bowl.....i might get one
if you but a gyrobowl in a gyrobowl incorrectly though, youll cause a black hole
*put
damit im doing that this week! cachi01
Thats a risk worth taking
worth it
SO worth it
twilight_sprinkle: .... i'm gonna try that if the gak meme keeps going :I
twilight_sprinkle: if that happens, use a calculator to divide by 0 to cancel it out
maybe only if GF lives
Yay new mouse
ello bstate
ew a hoodi
Hi HoodyNinja :3
I feel dumb for asking this, but.. when did Gak become a meme?
hai spriggles
but if you divide by 0 incorrectly, you open up a black hole inside the other black hole.
konochiwa, hoodi
*konichiwa
likeaboss: .... thanks you spoile it for me >:I
DinkyDoo: during the season 3 premier
Oh.
DinkyDoo: yesterdy
I need to find this server...
/me gets the shotgun >:I
TROctavia: if you divide 0 by 0 then you create another black hole, you need to divide and real number by 0 besides 0
yeah
TROctavia: then you just use a magnet
So many that it had to become a meme?
DinkyDoo, you're quick
DinkyDoo: yep
Wow, lucky guess.
DinkyDoo: ya
Whats the server on TF2? I wanna play on there!
I guessed that..

and if an equation is "bottom heavy" in the infinite limit
sorry for the spoiler :'(
Too bad
DEFENSE AGAINST THE DARK ARTS!
:|
Gyro bowl is the one true God.
I'm sorry, I had to say that..
shit, i was wrong :I
Jageman: I take BC Calc
funfact
0/0 is just undefined
dabi your god is a lie
and so are you.
0,14Praise be to Based Gyrobowl
Bronystate saw Gak before it became cool
U STARTIN'?
U WNA GO?
TROctavia: i failed calculus twice so i will take your word for it
i think this is where it all started CrimsonPhoenix :I
CrimsonPhoenix: people will laugh at us
the only god is Gary's Girth
nothing more
Jageman: Haha alright
I've always been wondering, can ponies use the Dark Arts? Like can they use the curses like Avada Kedevera..
thelonepony, we have video proof
Whoo, that was great.
I dunt here nuttin
any number /0 is undefined, if you take a limit its infinity
DinkyDoo: wrong universe
and cachi01 there were a lot of streams we weren't the only one
CrimsonPhoenix: i know, that's why
dat screen saver
I'm sorry, its just that I love harry potter..
Frankly, the Gyro Bowl is a better meme than Gak any day simply for being a good idea instead of something that got rammed through.
11,01That's it for me. Goodnight.
my screen saver swaps between all of man 6 and a few others
Plus ponies have different colored magic.. I think Queen Chrysalis had green magic..
thanks for streaming Nittany_Discord ,night
cya Nittany_Discord :)
any day of the week... bah, failed saying
Gyroball. Give me a huge one, and I will buy one
thanks Nittany_Discord that was fun
Night Nittany_Discord :)
Nittany_Discord, thanks for streaming.
DinkyDoo: otherwise they would have used a protronus charm on shadow pony
twilight_sprinkle: Not always. if you have removable discontinuity its a real value @ a value/0
Bye Nittany_Discord.
Night thanks for the stream
I mean, you can just run around without fucking up your food
Oh..
bye Nittany_Discord
Night Nittany_Discord.
TROctavia, twilight_sprinkle stahp my head is about to explode
I would LOVE to see a pony perform the dark arts..
Kandarihu I dun think the gyrobowl or gak should be rammed through anywhere.
cachi01: Oops, sorry.
Isn't that Twilight's doings?
DinkyDoo: go read a mlp/harrypotter fanfic
Twilight reminds me of Hermione..
DinkyDoo: but it would change the way ponies do magic and make crossfics with hp more likely
TROctavia: removable discontinuity? im not familiar with that term
YOUR GOD IS A LIE
YOUR COUCH SHALL BE SHANKED
cachi01: i like the math talk
Why am I even talking about harry potter?
/me head explodes
Nah Twilight reminds me more of Blossom
twilight_sprinkle: If you have something like (x^2 - 4) / (x-2)
TROctavia: you mean like x/x in which case its 1?
Jmo:I see you pushed your Royal Canterlot Voice Button there.
Let the products succeed or fail of their own merits. A bowl that doesn't spill, or a moldable slime? Which is better?
why are we doing maths?
TROctavia: and solve for x how?
Yes. At all values except for x = 0, where there would be a hole.
TROctavia: but how do you know what value it has if its a hole
WHY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT MATH D:
/me 's head explodes
Definately the bowl. as a youtube commenter said 'I CAN NOW EAT MY RASAINS ON A ROLLERCOASTER'
For the one i mentioned, you use "FOIL" or whatever you call it to make it (x-2)(x+2)/(x-2), and x-2 cancels out
TROctavia: visually i suppose you can see it, but still its a hole
DinkyDoo: Why not? :3
DinkyDoo: just close your eyes and cover your ears
AJIsAwesome: your back :3
then the graph looks like x+2, but at x = 2, theres a hole in the graph
:)
Oh cool, Dinky Doo has a ton of cutie marks in the show.
at (2,4), where x+2 wouldve put it.
TROctavia: but thats an invalid operation because it involves division by 0
OMG MAAATH :C
STAAAAAAHP
Welcome back, AJIsAwesome
:)
DABI UR GOD IS A LIA
:>
Thanks, Dark92Enigma. :)
DinkyDoo: stop hogging all the cutie marks
Pfft
Saxy
You're no fun
lia? is that a female name?
0,14lel I trol u
SaxyPretender is best ponay <3
The only thing worse than Twilight: MATH! (Not you, Twilight Sparkle, the movie Twilight..)
twilight_sprinkle: That's right. It doesn't exist at that point, but the graph approaching from the left and right approaches a real point that isnt infinite
nah math > twilight
math is a better love story than twilight
None Shall Utter The Cursed Movie's Name
True..
Cachi01: Math is a better love story..
if Lil_B was here... http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/250x250/28146958.jpg
It's a lesson in pre-calc. its limits
TROctavia: visually yes, but you can only judge visually if its a continous function, and i dont thinkthis is considered a contnious function
To Do So Is To Invite Crossfics With The Cursed Ones
EVERYTHING IS A BETTER LOVE STORY THAN _____ BREAKING DAWN, NEW MOON, ECT ECT.
Etc*
twilight_sprinkle: You're right that it isn't continuous for all reals of x, but you can see visually where it "would" be if you were looking at the whole thing
DinkyDoo: Careful Dinky
If Cedric didn't die in Harry Potter, we wouldn't have the sparkly fairy-Vampire Edward we have today.
It's not a continuous function, but you can still find the limit as x approaches 2.
Since limits do not look for the value itself, but rather for trending behavior.
if the limit from the right is identical to the limit from the left, then the limit at that point exists
TROctavia: but it could be a point just at any height
DinkyDoo: Quick, used the time turner to save Cedric
I lost my time turner :c
BUT I KNOW WHO WE CAN ASK! DOCTOR WHOOVES!
I was teaching this stuff to kids a few months ago so it's still fresh in my head. :P
Noooooooooooooo
CriticKitten: how would you take a limit in this case?
We can ask Doctor Whooves to help!
its not very fresh in my head, ive not taken limits in awhile but still
twilight_sprinkle: You can find the exact point if you use mathematical manipulation of expression.
DinkyDoo: You know the Doctor?
ALLONS-Y!
The limit of (x^2 - 4) / (x-2) ya mean?
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352654088870.jpg
CriticKitten: for example
0,14>see math
Jageman: Not really.. o_o
0,14>walk back out
DinkyDoo: Or are you refurring to Time Turner
TROctavia: but again how
I dunno..
but thats division by 0
CONFUSED.COM
Nope.
If you break (x^2 - 4) into (x-2)(x+2), you can divide out the top and bottom (x-2) terms
Saxy take me with you D:
DinkyDoo: Mister "Sand Timer = Time Traveler"
(x-2) was canceled earlier in the problem.
oh God math
Sand timer?
I can't math
ikr
This is simple math, too
seriously I haven't been able to math since high school
but how can you cancel the x-2 if its zero
this is simple?
DinkyDoo: that is his cutie mark
I can explain differential and integral polar coordinates if you dare me
ugh I need some coffee
It doesn't matter what it is, twilight_sprinkle.
brb
Aw, I gtg..
Bye guys!
DinkyDoo: Bye
DinkyDoo: cya
(Waves)
The value of the variable isn't applied until you CHOOSE to apply it, that's how limits work.
Bye DinkyDoo :)
CriticKitten: but thats an operation which reqires already having proven what we're trying to prove, which is 0/0
/me waves goodbye to DinkyDoo
oh oh oh fluid dynamics!
I'll be on tomorrow, same chat-room.
/me deidles
So you can use algebra to simplify the problem and THEN plug in the limit's value.
Bye everypony!!
CrimsonPhoenix: suddenly sombra is awesome....
although i think you could do it by taking a limit just by saying its not 0 but approaching
I miss Dinky already
Wait we're in calculus now? COOL
*do fluid dynamics. i was thinking you might take requests :P
i guess in that case you could do it, bit you cant do it just algebraically i think
why are we MATHIIING?!
Not at all necessary, twilight_sprinkle. Like I said, I taught this stuff a few months ago. The procedure for limits is simple:
DRHUnleashed: they are arguing about dividing by 0 :I
^
ah
because i mentioned dividing by 0
^^*
CriticKitten: i know how to take limits.
...
0,14dat +m
Whoops
LEL.
Smart ass.
sunovabitch
<:
lol
its really 1.
XD
:D
2) If that didn't solve it, proceed to factor the equation and/or use any algebriac tricks to remove portions of the equation such that the limit can be solved without equaling 0/0.
WHAT?!
................................................
WHY DID YOU MAKE HIM AN OP!?
otakon: You saw that too, right?
umad?
yes
HA!
otakon
Poor potato.
back down to regular
He wrote me a gyro bowl fic
.......
So he got ops
what?
Lel
LOL
0,14ahahahahahhahahaha
:D
GODDAMMIT DARIBOT!
lawl
lol wtf gyro bowl fic
The kick of love
:3
[03:15:50] James (Jaymo): Once there was a god called Gyrobowl, dabi praised him, Gyrobowl therefore rewarded him with power. The End.
;D
*:D
best
fic
Best fanfic ever.
Observe my wonderful story.
ever
Use L'hopital's rule on sinx / x. You will get cosx / 1. at 0, cosx = 1, and 1/1 = 1. That's the end of math for now.
CriticKitten: well for limits i guess it works that way because its not actually 0, but it cant be done without taking a limit
Gyrobowl should be an item in Zelda
a legendary item no less
TROctavia: you cant use that rule because its not approaching 0 or infinity
yeah it is. its 0/0
wubbajack?
He never said how long it has to be.
The Legend of Zelda and the Gyrobowl of Truth
GG :>
i wish i posted this yesterday http://img691.imageshack.us/img691/6043/0cb7ca06f71341639af23b8.jpg
CrimsonPhoenix: Best Zelda game ever.
TROctavia: but we have no idea what that is
at a point that yields 0/0, l'hopital's rule can be used
thelonepony: :D
thelonepony: lol
o wait
twilight_sprinkle: What can't be done? Solving for division by zero?
gyrobowl sounds like one of those mcguffins that features in bad scifi and fantasy
thelonepony: lol
it basically says to differentiate the top and bottom.
:S
CrimsonPhoenix: ganondorf controls gak and you have to destroy him and his evil gak forces?
wait i forgot the function
There isn't any form of math that allows you to do that for EVERY case.
wat
cachi01: -_-
cachi01, perfect
Only specific case scenarios
Mutterguy: Its the only thing that can contain the singularity
wubbajack solves all problems
:kickcount thelonepony
with complete randomness
damn it ;^:
mfw kickount doesnt work nymore :(
So...The Gyro Bowl is a thing...that holds your breakfast cereal...
...Seems legit to me.
cachi01: I'll forgive you this one time. :P
but first all the gak are hiding behind the foam
CriticKitten: im saying it cant be done without taking a limit. i mean it can be done to get the right answer, but it wouldnt be right
say the top is f(x) and the bottom is g(x). It looks like f(x)/g(x). L'hopital's rule says that the limit at that point, when you have a 0/0 or an inf/inf, is f'(x)/g'(x).
At last! The gyrobowl Son I shall rule the world MUHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! *Thunderclap*
VenHur: and doesnt spill
anyone know where i can find a wubbajack?
kosoru: that's Bronystate for ya :3
TROctavia: yeah i get i forgot the function we were talking about
twilight_sprinkle: My point is that you can't solve it for every case.
wubbajack?
kosoru: the hell is a wubbajack?
its from skyrim
twilight_sprinkle: It would only work for specific case scenarios. There isn't a universal way to solve 0/0 because that isn't a defined quantity.
that's a Wabbajack
kosoru: candlejack? nope sorry i dont know whe
I was never good at l'hopital's rule :/
look it up on the interwebs idiot
kosoru: it's in the Blue Palace
So I just wanted to hop on and thank the BronyState community for being here. I feel like I really joined the Brony community yesterday when I watched my first MLP premier live with the fandom. Thank you all.
Mutterguy: Quick, We must break into his battleship and find the Gyrobowl before its too late.
gid damnit
CriticKitten: that i know
kosoru: use google u idiot instead of asking here
yay Big_Macintosh_1992 :)
No problem, Big_Macintosh_1992 :P
Big_Macintosh_1992: welcome to the site! Hope you enjoy your time here :)
Hi Big_Macintosh_1992 :)
otakon: i've been on the site for a while now, but that was my first premier
well all the same
well im off to get my self killed looking for the palace... god damn zombie mod and your accursed dildo quivers.
Mutterguy: Nvm, now it just sounds like a fetch quest.
otakon: Big_Macintosh_1992 is kinda a regular lol
FLOAM
GAK
kosoru: ....you idiot THAT is why it's gonna happen
but i agree it can be done with a limit, just not without, because without its at a fixed point basically
so yeah all the gaks are hidden behind the floam
cachi01: i try to be... when i get free time
gak
floam behind the first threat
NO >:I
Jageman still could be a mcguffin
Technically 0/0 isn't anywhere. :p
jubugilator
mcguffin?
It doesn't exist.
Mutterguy: true
EGG McMUFFIN
aint that the guy from lucius?
CriticKitten: well that was my original point
Mutterguy: for a b movie though
cheese its!
twilight_sprinkle: Yeah, but the answer lies in limits themselves.
but as the game goes on you realize that the floam are made of gak which is an ancient dark essense that came back with Ganondorf
Needs moar World's Biggest Tea Party
floam is mostly gak
gigitty
So, anyone else looking forward to some fan made music remixes this season?
i are
I am!
yeah. cachi01 the Crystal heart would count as a Mcguffin
ow
Just waiting for some kick ass music from this season
guys remember. it doesnt matter how hard you try. luigi always wins by doing absolutely nothing.ALWAYS
that hurt
then they can get started
Truth is, the fan music is one of the main reasons I became a brony
cachi01: unless the power goes out
Big_Macintosh_1992: Absolutely. Same here
AL
cachi01: then the world dissapeares
WAYS
my shelf just landed on my head and i think i should go to the hospial
Jageman: ALWAYS
*hospital
kosoru: cool story bro
no stream?
cachi01: absolutes don't exist and they never will
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_EG4uUROyQ best song
i feel like setting things on fire.. anyone know a therapist?
kosoru: Drive yourself there. It'll be great, go for it
what car?
kosoru if you see stars or your scalp is bleeding then probably.
btw Hi Guys :)
use my car
shit my comps going to overheaton me gtg
Hi sonicdude558 :)

Anyone want another Twi plushie?
sonicdude558: No, I want the real thing
heavy born
poo tis pow
/me throws 100 Twi plushies into the chat
Plushie Wonderland! :)
poot
POOT
hey guys
hi SeaponiesofLiverpool :)
/me is buried alive
Hi, SeaponiesofLiverpool. :)
do you have any questions about equestria and politics?
I can't see!
Hi SeaponiesofLiverpool :)
To be honest, if there would be more songs than usual
Nothing but a sea of purple!
/me is having trouble breathing
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBOduBUOLIM Resonantwaves - Crystal Palace
I want them all to have all the mane 6 sing in it
it's just beautifull when they all sing together
^
indeed
yes quite
Pretty much what made the "Success" song stand out from the other two
It's the harmonization that sends shivers down one's spine
sonicdude558: what do i do with all of these, im a closet brony
crystal fair had it has well but it was a bit shorter
^^vv<><>BA start
still great
AJIsAwesome: beautiful
do you guys have any politics questions for Equestria
nope
/me throws 10 Twi fursuits into the chat
this is a pretty epic theme http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csI1AzohlAA
like how Colt Rove spent 300 million bits on a losing candidate
sonicdude558: Why do you do that?
You've done that before as well
I have a blog with the Prime Minister of Equestria
dabi u type fast
How does that have any relevance to anything?
oh shush. I am just having fun. Usually I get people to react
sonicdude558, not everyone enjoys the idea of fursuits you know
when I throw a plushie
brb, getting frozen kit-kat :3
why would you freeze a kit-kat
/me is weirded out by the empty twilight suits
/me throws the ******** into a disintergrator outside the chat
thelonepony: onna dem kit kat ice creams?
let's burn them and never speak of them again
twilight_sprinkle: no
you don't have to freeze them to put them on ice cream
oi, your not burning anything twilight sparkle related as long as im here
*youre
Zamer: nope
did you know equestria votes on a Prime Minister every 6 years
Freezing candy is fun
they serve for 1 term
sonicdude558: and keep the door closed, that stuff is going to smell
ok
Can I vote for myself as the PM?
/me closes the chat door
SeaponiesofLiverpool: really?
PM?
SeaponiesofLiverpool: What is your source?
yes... very efficient political system
Prime minister?
it is such a shame that Bronystate does not like Roleplay.
Night all
NIght, Lunac. :)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiz95K1ngiI&feature=g-all-lik
Night Lunac :)
P.ersonal M.essage
night Lunac
dari do it
Prime Minister acts as Vox Populi and chief advisor
So anyway, I did what I came to do. Thanks again and have a good night.
cachi01, I saw that earlier, I really don't know what to say about it
CrimsonPhoenix: By PM i meant prime minister.
CrimsonPhoenix: that it looks awesome :3
prime minister is chosen from the governors
and didn't he reviewed ET before?
I can use that job.
CrimsonPhoenix: nope
governors are voted on
SeaponiesofLiverpool: so you are just making this up.
maybe I'm confusing with someone else....
Vox Populi = Voice of the population?
I know italian, not latin. :|
the Vox Populi to the Princesses
TROctavia: of the people, so you are correct
sweet
taking italian is helping
Ok, i gotta go everypony.....bedtime for me
during Celestia's hibernation, Prime Minister served basically as president
Bye, Dark92Enigma. :)
Cya, Dark92Enigma
Bye Dark92Enigma :)
adios Dark92Enigma :)
now Celestia signs/vetos laws.... AND acts as Supreme Court
(with Luna
hibernation?
AJIsAwesome. bye, sorry if i bored you to death with the Joker speech :(
AGAIN
Dark92Enigma: Pfft. that fine! I enjoyed it. :D
ok... Celestia banishes Luna.... celestia is very weakened.... and goes into deep slumber
kinda like King ARthur
*that's fine
This is the most friendly chat I have ever been to.
during which the ponies govern themeselves.... AND the events of Hearth's Warming happen
after hearth's warming the ponies write up a constitution....
SeaponiesofLiverpool: Wrong, I just got done watching that episode.
Hearth's Warming is post Luna banishment
SeaponiesofLiverpool: spike clearly states that equestria was founded before celestia rule
hearths warming?
Jageman, rule being a keyword
http://ponysquare.com/file/pic/photo/2012/02/d985fb3de51972964c1ea3d41066a5a4_500.png
thelonepony: :D
SeaponiesofLiverpool: canon states that the unicorns moved the sun and mone
the friendship machine!
CrimsonPhoenix: the unicorn were incharge of the day and night
I Keep finding them in Unexpected places :D
Ponies could never spread friendship in this world. People are too corrupt
weeping_pegasi82: It's nice. :)
Jageman, they did this while Celestia was recovering from the enormous power drain she experienced from banishing luna
TROctavia - we are perfectly capable of spreading friendship
we just tend to use Uranium as a carrier
SeaponiesofLiverpool: speculation
weeping_pegasi82: neat :3
good thing: EQUESTRIA has almost 0% unemployment!
yay
lol. friendly uranium
SeaponiesofLiverpool Jageman wowowowowow where did you got this info?
cutie marks
SeaponiesofLiverpool, I do say that Luna and Celestia started to rule after the foundation of equestria
SeaponiesofLiverpool: directly from the show
http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/photos/images/newsfeed/000/177/411/tumblr_lr9pobivRp1qj41h3o1_500.png?1318992465
Can we present this to the UN and make a worldwide government like equestrias?
SeaponiesofLiverpool: season 2 episode 11
heck just after defeating Discord
Celestia and Luna are on the Equestrian flag....
thelonepony: :D
Luna knows starswirl...
SeaponiesofLiverpool: its a play, they made a mistake
SeaponiesofLiverpool, the only image modern Equestrian could get
Celestia and Luna are pre-hearth's warming
SeaponiesofLiverpool: it was not exactly a profetional play
SeaponiesofLiverpool: there is no direct canon evidence of that
SeaponiesofLiverpool: of course she knows starswirl she is a princess she must have knowledge about equestria history
SeaponiesofLiverpool: nor this hibernation hypothosis
suddenly, wubstream
a Phase4 Stream :3
Phase stream?
yup
Ah.
that startled me a bit
:3
I see the chat program he used. :D
CrimsonPhoenix, :3
holy what?
she PERSONALLY knew starswirl
CrimsonPhoenix: he does that
00,02ohai otakon
not a fan of those type of songs
SeaponiesofLiverpool: she never said that
hiya Phase4 giving steaming a shot again?
too agressive
SeaponiesofLiverpool: how do you know?
00,02otakon, mgiht as well, bored here
SeaponiesofLiverpool: she recognized his sigiture clothes
odl!
SeaponiesofLiverpool: she never says she knew starswirl personally
:)
Lol
Was that math i see
it is implied in Nightmare night episode
"bored on stream? teach Linear Mechanics"
SeaponiesofLiverpool: where
00,02thats taking its time
starswirl is heavily hinted to be close to the princesses like Twilight
SeaponiesofLiverpool: then i guess twilight also knew starswirl
00,02TROctavia, electrical machines class
doth thou wish to know why Equestria has almost 0% unemployment
00,02TROctavia, its the math that explains magnets
SeaponiesofLiverpool: cause she knew about him and his clothes
Sweet. That's where im bound in a few years i think
must.... resist... magnet joke...
00,02XD
SeaponiesofLiverpool: all she did was recognize one of the most importiant pony in magic history
00,02anyone here got synergy?
once with luna recognizing the costume and the other with that book at the end of season 3 pilot
doth thou wish to know why Equestria has almost 0% unemployment
got synergy?
SeaponiesofLiverpool: everyone knows about albert einstine
wat meen do u, Phase4
00,02twilight_sprinkle, mod
o lel ok
08,01Phase4: imma callin' you
i dont
It’s about their cutie marks. A pony with mechanic, librarian, or etc. cutie mark can always find a job, and it’ll be in their field. Plus, because its something they love doing, the amount of bits that they make from it aren’t very important. If they make enough to have a place to stay and have food to eat that’s enough. Either way ponies are always willing to help each other out with charity.
00,02Pings everywhere
08,01Phase4: skype
lol
SeaponiesofLiverpool: many science history buffs would recognize his clothes on sigh
I'm back, ponies.
I feel we'll have a lot of info about starswirl
Welcome back, VenHur. :)
00,02oh, so you are
poop
wb VenHur :)
This looks shopped
Yes, I'm VenHur.
dat facepaint
CrimsonPhoenix: And he'll be voiced by Patrick Stewart and will be awesome
waw
cutie marks = always get a job in your field.... and # bits doesn't as long as you have enough to live on
00,02probably gona play a game yeah
00,02XD
pick oop tha fookin phoone LOL
SeaponiesofLiverpool: luna was never established to know star swirl
Phase4: So what games do you strive for tonight?
J_E_Smith71, are you implying on a Starswirl vs Discord moment?
00,02VenHur, not sure
SeaponiesofLiverpool: and your hibernation theory has NO canon evidence
i haven't seen a game of MvM in a while
Hm... [puts thinking hat on]
CrimsonPhoenix: I dunno, to me it'd be awesome for Starswil to be voiced by Stewart:p
it fits with all the sources in Equestrian history
SeaponiesofLiverpool: Sorry for being so forceful
SeaponiesofLiverpool: and which sources are those?
or maybe john de lancie
canon
I know of one flash game.
SeaponiesofLiverpool: just because it fits does not mean it happened
SeaponiesofLiverpool: and where and how did you read all those sources?
J_E_Smith71, and it's definitely not because Discord is voiced by deLancie
It's called Dino Run.
Screwball is Desmond Miles.....
Derpy_Hooves, Phase4
Screwball is an Assassin
DerpyMuffins: Nope its Phase
i imagine starswirl with a gandalf voice lol
is it me or is the art from s3e1 like.. way higher quality?
SeaponiesofLiverpool: this is why fanon is difficult to discuss here
DerpyMuffins, it's Phase 4

weeping_pegasi82: thank you

00,02nvidia service must have died
SeaponiesofLiverpool: oooh for pc?
Allegr0 should give me all his non-foil Twilight Sparkle cards
how about: Princess Platinum's castle is the old castle in the EFF.
they founded Equestria at Canterlot
gak gak gak....
they basically moved from Ponyville to Canterlot...
no
GAKgakGAK
no gak
NO
>:I
SeaponiesofLiverpool: wow..........you know that equestria is the country right?
lol k
this song
<3
XD
:D
SeaponiesofLiverpool: also speculation
No Gak. Gyrobowl is truth
If equestria is the country, what's the planet called
Nice bg music.
Earth
i think the planet IS equestria
In fanon it's Equis.
the solar system is not Earth's
SeaponiesofLiverpool: also, that castle was covered in snow
Oh god, seriously? Candy Cane flavored potato chips!? http://dinosaurdracula.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/pring-1.jpg
No, Earth is belonged to the Humans.
I thought was equestria was the planet
I mean THIER world.
Tell that to the origin of her Cutie Mark
J_E_Smith71: pringles? must be delicious
sorry...dont know what else to talk about...missed yesterday's season premire...
J_E_Smith71: :S
Equestria has an entirely different solar system
They often say What in equestria was that
haseo348: Have you seen the episode?
and this has canon evidence.
SeaponiesofLiverpool: now your just trolling
What exactly is getting streamed?
no...only heard about the gak incident...
00,02what happened to the acceleration options
:/
gak... http://i.imgur.com/47AkI.gif
canon evidence that Equestria solar system =/= earth solar system
Equestria's a country. Equis is the fanon-chosen name for the world
haseo348: You should watch it.
EWWW candy flavored potato chips
Meow?
Baa.
Nyah~?
i know.....but how o.o..?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agnM1sbinRw&feature=endscreen&NR=1
Has anyone ever owned gak? Is it as fun as it looks?
moo i'm a bird :3
haseo348: Youtubte? :)
yes Punkie
*Youtube
look at the stain glass windows... one depicts the solar system.... Nothing like Earth's solar system
SeaponiesofLiverpool: they were never on earth
Zamer: No vid links during stream. :)
i look around
SeaponiesofLiverpool: ever
ill* on youtube then
lol dirtville
http://fav.me/d5kslci this kind of letter is giving me some ideas
... What's getting streamed, exactly?
Stream is frozen for me
same
it stopped
like what if transtemporal letters could be two-ways
Costume Quest once stremer fixers their graphics card
http://media-cache-ec4.pinterest.com/upload/157766793167151713_VYl9JGgl_222.jpg i do this to my brother alot
SeaponiesofLiverpool: Faust wanted the story to take place in the pony world
Oh.
Gak is Smooze?
past writing for the future and future writing for the past
SeaponiesofLiverpool: i believe they live on a planet the size of mars, because there is no way Pegaai can fly in a gavity like ours.
how would one work out on that
Mike
SeaponiesofLiverpool: Confirmed trolling
who ever ask about gak about how fun it looks....it is really fun to play with...
00,02having problems with ffsplit
What, Mihoshika.
not trolling.. just extrapolation and using the science of deduction
Pegasi don't have wings like birds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhy7dXWjpAA
the saddest moment in MLP...........is when you finish watching every single episode
oh indeed
Gak is Humanity's attempt at bringing the Smooze alive
it's all good Phase4, I have my iTunes :P
like what you said about a mars sized planet
Punkie_Pue: lol
Their wings use magic to fly, more or less.
flutterchu, solution
well, everything has to end at one point flutterchu :/
/me coughs
rewatch all of the episode from the begining
^
Phew!
or that
and where there's a end there's a beginning
0,14gesuenhedi9wecnu ducnejrnfceuid
I wish they could make an election episode.
im thinking about starting a card game with the trading cards
....
Mihoshika: or they have passive wind bending abilities
I think Fry fixed it
00,02that working?
Derpy runs for mayor of Ponyville
Mihoshika: They have wings. There is no ay they'd be able to support a pony in a gravity like ours. my point stands.
yus
lol
i agree SaxyPretender
omigush its raining outside :D
...
0,14Of course, my way is the best.
Pegasus and Unicorns were Eohippus...
Workin just fine
thelonepony: Lucky. :(
It's alive...
^-^
The "punch it until it bleeds" way?
0,14Of course
That's no way to perform first aid.
Mike 1 word to counter your logic, Magic
holy shit this game
0,14It is the way of the man
AJIsAwesome: well, i hope it rains for you :)
the unicorn and pegasi traits went extinct... they were used as defense mechanisms against dinosaurs and diatrymas
thelonepony: Thanks. :$
This game is awefully familiar.
Phase4: Can you narrate it for us
and i heard that it my snow tomorrow :3
who is streaming?
may*
(says the guy who has had his possession of testicles repeatedly disputed in chat)
aliens?
that ping
Derpy_Hooves: Phase4. :3
Derpy_Hooves: Phase4 :3
called it
....WUT.
CANDY CRYSIS!
TO THE BUNKER
if pegasi are wind benders, that would help explain how rainbow dash was able to break the mach 1
00,02can you guys read text?
Phase4: i heard good things about this game :3
Yep. :3
so of it
i am first aid!
some*
Yesh :3

l4d2 is calling me <3
Mike: Just saying what I read.
00,02Excelent, cause my microphone is like nails against a chalkboard
Cya everypony I'm off
yes, but a bit slower when transition wpould be nice
lol
Aw.
or it could be that Rainbow Dash has always been radically awesome and cool
Phase4 or SuperBrony64 remind me of thelivingtombstone
Bye, DerpyMuffins. :)
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Addition to Bronycon Venue Announcement

00,02henaye_cochone, its doing that automatically
oh.
Mihoshika: Please site any sources, please.
hey how do i do the pony faces O.o
my bad
my screen resolution is 1920 ish and I can read it
flutterchu: why is that?
00,02so
Mike: they could have passive magic abilities, that would explain why only the earth ponies can grow food
00,02boy/girl

funfact: in the gameloft game every fucking pony can do a sonic boom
Boy
Boy.

>Apparently we completely forgot their press release yesterday! Bronycon has released a bunch of extra information in regards to their venue announcement. Head on down past the break to check it all out!
Mike: I'd need to find it again, then.
lawl EQS
boy
EQD**
00,02boy wins
What game is this? looks creepy with 2 wide eyed smiley kids and one being pointed to....O_O
thelonepony: there personalities and there voices and there interactions
heres a fun fact that should be obvious...
EQD in a nutshell
wait i demand a recount
i saw we elect PIKACHU
Celestia sent Granny Smith to Ponyville because of Luna
say*
0,14gg EqD
flutterchu: we havent heard Phase4 voice and SuperBrony64 voice is a bit diffrent
Mike: so its possible that pegasi have passive magic that helps them fly
SaxyPretender: gg?
^?
gg = good game
"Good game?"
00,02oh damn
00,02the inputs broken
0,14gg = good games, good going
0,14or
crap
0,14in my case
Oh...
00,02its not designed for windowed mode
0,14Guilty Gear
Phase4: noes! this game is fun though
Mike: or atleast gives their wings more energy than normally permitted
thelonepony: i heard Phase4 a LONG time ago (july i beleve) and i heard SuperBrony64 on agust...he was playing with his sister
Gabby Gums
Celestia sent Granny Smith to Ponyville area so that when Luna returned in a hundred or so years... it would make things easier....
Jageman: So, what would happen if you cut off a pegasus's wing? would it still fly due to magics?
wow, you been here longer than me :/
...why would you cut off its wings?
in th first place?
I wouldn't say good ol' regs room, but good ol' shinanigans.
Mike: the passive magic is not strong enough alone, or scootalo could fly
00,02yeah, this isnt going to work
and we already know when a pegasus has a broken wing they cannot fly
haseo348: Science.
what do ou think JAgeman
ahh
Shush. The dead are trying to sleep.
applying science to a cartoon
0,14braaaaaaains
gg for me is insulting
thelonepony: actually i didnt touch the computer all summer (personall reasons) im pretty sure were tied on how long weve been here
Mike: it just lightens the load
what is this science you speak of?
Celestia sent Granny Smith to Ponyville area so that when Luna returned in a hundred or so years... it would make things easier....
00,02this seems to be working
I pity the dead who can't experience these joys.
http://cdn.uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/tumblr_ll5i7fzKpo1qfbe21o1_500.jpg
then again I've played League of Legends for way too long
same Crimson
0,14Yeah?
0,14Well, I pity da foo'
been almost 4 days
since I played League
We are the dead / short days agao
Zamer, rating?
CrimsonPhoenix: gg is seen as offensive is League of Legends?
SaxyT, why you so saxy.
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow
no it's not
Loved and were loved / and now we lie / in Flander's Field.
0,14:3
and rating?
lol i see my name on live stream x3
AJIsAwesome, yes cause most of the time when you're losing it's torture
That...sounds familier.
Lol
Zamer, I meant ranking sorry
Aw
The humor is SO rich.
I sang that song in the choir I was in a couple years ago.
I always say gg even if I'm losing.
Mike: also, pegasi can do pushups using their wings. so, not normal possible with any kind of wing
i'm low because of trolls and RQers
hey guys...
and i stopped doing ranked
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lsavzdeIM21qzfa2lo1_500.jpg
FUNNY
:D
but it's like 820somethin right now
/me hasn't even hit 30 yet
I've had a theory for a while now. Magic needs a focal point. A sharp point on the body, or a sharp extension. Ex: Tip of a wand/horn/feather. For earth ponies, it radiates outwards from them at a constant rate, causing things to gro faster.
lolwut
probably
How about: things happen because magic.
I can agree with Mike
Or: Magic is as magic does.
what about Pets
Child Abduction?
Pets = magical power
only thing bad about LoL is when you start losing early game people will rage hard
To quote a tired meme: It's magic, we ain't gotta explain shit.
how about: its a fucking cartoon.
ouch
Man, LoL players can be such douches.
Zamer, that's not it, it's the whole community
because friendship = magic. Pets are like friendship
it's not the whole community
that didn't sound good :S
Mike: unless its very low power and always on, which would limit is capacity and flexablity
so having a pet increases a pony's magical ability
On the other hand, I've gotten teams where I've DC'd for the first five minutes and they've immediately worked to get me back up to speed.
What...the..fuuuuuck!
COMBAT!
wut
oh shiiiit!
mainly those at 30 who have a giant ego
The kid became a Gundam!
um.............
In Flander's Fields
holy crap that kids a decepticon!
there's only a small portion in the community that's actually sane
this game is awesome XD
shit just got real
Lol
Oppa Gundam Style
yeah you just teleport to a pocket dimension to fight
A poem I have memorized thanks to Remembrance Day
(today)
god i hate my computer...
also the enemies get nastier too
Seaponiesofliverpool: Depends on the pet. Only magical beings contain active/passive magic. Pheonixes have magic, dogs don't.
[mindfuck] I-Uh-Duhuhuh-dwuuueeee! [faints]
isnt nightmare night over........austrailia has a fucked up timezone
this is on consoles too
it's a fun game
not long
btw guys all the crystal ponies are 1000 years old
not hard, but fun
That games seems horrible, imo.
WOAH
any theory about that?
guys did you see picture?
The worst part of the LoL community...is the Brazilians.
Mike: but unicorn magic could be a process of taking unfocused internal magic and focusing it through a conductor of sorts
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lsavzdeIM21qzfa2lo1_500.jpg
cachi01: doesn't count, imprisoned in a curse for that long
actually they got their own server now Reikim
I wish to apologize. I had no idea it was a poem converted into a form of song.
;D
Then why do I still have to deal with them?
Mike: that would make sense
:D
Saxy
otakon1: yeah but it was a amnesia curse. not an inmortality curse
You btich
0,14<3
because not all spanish speaking players are from Brazil
HUEHUEHUEHUE
BR?
Putin on the Ritz
guys....
Oh SaxyPretender
get it?
Lmao
cachi01: that also sealed the kingdom away from the rest of Equestria for 1000 years
Jageman: Similar to a wand or feather. ANd as i said about earth ponies, radiating and causing plants to grow.
I get it, dont worry
SeaponiesofLiverpool: no
'S okay. It's not really big outside of Canada anyway.
faqoff
and their server is prestealth-patch eve tier
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lsavzdeIM21qzfa2lo1_500.jpg
wow this kid's life must suck if he's only halloween to look forward to
Hey Saxy.

HOW ABOUT THAT GIRL, HUH?
SeaponiesofLiverpool: :)
lol
0,14...Low blow, Reikim
00,02...
You hit me with Brazilians
00,02that happened
It's ALMOST equivalent.
/me snickers
so how bout that gyrobowl
Mike: it does make sense, if magic works like a form of electricity, or electromagnetic radiation
soldier is best robot
But no hard feelings
phase are you the one streaming?
electromagic radiation
Because we all know you out-manly me about ten to one
...Okaaay...
beep boop son, beep boop
im new to this....
0,14;__;
So /) because at least you got to the asking stage.
How the fuck can he transforms!?
You are all gay.
are you space dad?
but for current MOBA's LoL has the nicest community
and only in battles Ven
Jageman: Science is fun.
IS THIS EVEN REALITY?!
My little pony is for little girls, not grown people.
we may be gay.. but we have muffins
ikr
they can transform to whatever their costumes are wearing
ponies are gay
>_>
Them and their portugeuse language. How dare them speak something simlar to spanish but not entirely so.
Eww, ponies. <_<
Venhur: Is this the real life...
What game is this?
Mike: of course, if thats true, it would explain why crystals are so powerfully conductive
Costume Quest
AttackWithHugs: blck ops 2
I hate ponies >_>

You make your costumes and there are several to choose from by the end of the game
Jageman: I think we broke MLP logic.'
SeaponiesofLiverpool: SUX!!!!!!!!!!!
lol what wrong about a show that encourages friendship?
Mike: or is this fantasy
Faggots.
Pirates, Ninja's, French Fries, Knights, Statue of Liberty
Mike: a crystaline latice would be a perfect conductor of energy, depending on the elements involved
0,14Oh silly me

Zamer: You mean the original show, right?
lol
/me nuzzles Jaymoo back
Trolls?
Zamer: It was also meant to be appealing for the mothers who were taking care of said children.
Shizuka's streaming?
Mike: all we did is find a solution to the magic problem
flutterchu: nope it's Phase4
0,14nope, Phase4 is streaming

Precisely.
OH HELLL NOOOO
LOL
Buck-ka-ke....
what is it?
rick james is best pokemon
It would cause a tighter lattice, able to hold more magic energy.
Mike: i do not have a background in metalurgy
BROHOOFS EVERY WHERE
Pika?
Rick kames bitch
SeaponiesofLiverpool: Do you really want to know? :S
Magic Spincter?
You know, one time last week, there were a couple of bullies on the IRC insulting us as hard as they could.
i'll use my trusty frying pan
SeaponiesofLiverpool: dont ask :S
as a drying pan!
Kandarihu: And I'm guessing it wasn't succesful, correct?
haHAA
whats with all the mummies
toilet paper brigade
RoboGerbil: imagine the mummies are oc
AJIsAwesome, they got away with it because there were no mods to ban them.
Jageman: One of the pros of being a redditor.
I needs sleepies -.-
Kandarihu: What timw did this happen?
RoboGerbil: and their names are blainbow blash blilight and blinkie pie

Night, Ponies47. :)

Redditor Scooby Doo
whats wrong with me today :D
Rut ro
haseo348: Gender stereotypes, not commiting to society's laws, etc.
Mike: thereby allowing the material the handle more energy before failure?
whats wrong with gender
haseo348: Some people just can't accept masculine people appreciating femminine work
Kandarihu... its Whinnysday
ah gotcha
Jageman: Yes.
immature assholes if you ask me
haseo348: Also the fact that some bronies attempt the shove the show and its teachings/fandom down other people's throats.
^
Mhm
Its true
*to
so like religion?
Celestiday, Lunday, Tuesday, Whinnysday, Thorseday, Friday, Saddlesday
Mike: why not use a carbon crystal ?
and most feminine work was stuff that wasn't considered manly at the time
Lots of people hate religion for the same reason.
^^
I don't get why science and religion can't get along.
Jageman: Diamonds would be the perfect item for storing and channeling magic energy.
lol i dont really care what people think of me if they think im gay then let them...
But i have to say: Almost no one knows i like the show, but they think im one of the more manly people in the school, i think
Well, there are a lot of atheists the same way.
Mike: except they are not very electricly conductive
would you rather: have an upside down nose.....or have your tongue on the top of your mouth
Religion is : "God/higher power did this" science is: "How god/higher power did it"
00,02XD XD XD
Lolwat?
00,02that was excelent
haseo348: Let the immature idiots have they're stupid fun

This game is...
FUCKING AWESOME IN EVERY WAYS!
in my school there is a brony club.
Even humor.
yay
Upside Down Nose so i can see all my epic boogers :D
theres a pegasister in my new school
haseo348: lucky ;3;
i mean, if you had your nose upside down, then water would get in it when you showered
i know right
call it Pegasis please
I would tell everyone a brony, but because of the judgemental nature of people, I just can't
Pegasis sounds cooler
so much win
Found a brony club at my university. It's pretty nice.
and almost everyone knows im a brony it both the schools i've studied
Mike: blue diamonds are simiconductive though
i found a brony at my school
AJIsAwesome: nice
what do you guys think. Pegasis....
AJIsAwesome: awesome
I found some random kid with a 20% cooler shirt, and i was giggling
Mike: they would allow magic in and contain it for a while
my friends were like, wtf
lol
Hi everyone.
yo bro
Jageman: Magic would not be like electricity. Thnk that if there was a second particle that orbits nuclei besides electrons that can travel through non-conductors. Tat wwould be magic.
i have a wonder bolt hoodie :D
Mike: if magic behaves like electricity
Hey, Kinixys
Hi, Kinixys. :)
wat game?
/me wishes he found chests full of candy when he went trick or treating
There's one guy in my class who likes the show and he and his wife watch it together, but he doesn't pay attention to the fandom
Hi Kinixys :)
Mike: that would never exist
MAgelectric chairs
Jageman: Neither does magic.
real men watch ponys
Killing criminals with magic
fake men play call of duty
SeaponiesofLiverpool: I know what you mean by the pegasis ("bro"ny pega"sis"ter), but I consider pegasister a much more proper label.
Random
Mike: touche
Pegasis is better
What do you prefer? The fandom or the show?
Both.
Equally.
the show
show
Both you sillieh :3
I like that Free candy
fandom some times goes way overboard
peg-a-sus , peg-a-sis.... peg-a-sis-ter adds an extra syllable that doesn't fit
Mike: i like to think of magic as an unknown particle
Mike: that has no charge
That's fair. I've watched a lot more fan made material though
11,02flutterchu: I'm a living tombstone? D:
08,01okay everyone, i've done some analysis of our analytics data from yesterday
so what is going to be the Unicorns off the fandom
I love the encounter music
and?
08,01and i've settled on what i believe our viewing figure was
MAGES!
when a friend gives me a cookie: oh thx :). when my best friends give me a cookies: what the fuck did you guys did to it.
haseo348: Agreed.
I don't appreciate people telling me I'm wierd or gay for not liking all sports, hanging out, doing weed, and playing 1st person shooters. I can be different and still be a great person. To think i need to do what someone else says is ignorant and immature.
tell us D:
SuperBrony64: nope.........THE...living tombstone
The show's good, but there's a lot of good fanfics :P
Record break?
did you see Shining Armor's Twitter?
Mike: but is attracted to different organic chemicals
Jageman: I like to think of it as a charge neither negative nor positive, and it attracts itself to other magic.
08,01we had about about 40,000 viewers in total yesterday
2985?
wow :O
40,000?!
:o
WHAT?!
dear freakin' lord....
Sweet!
THATS OVER NINE THOUSAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN
D
@ShiningArmor Playing darts with my wife.... Lots of fun
08,01that's in total though, not peak
derpy hooves...derpy hooves EVERY WHERE
sweet Celestia
different IP's or at different times
AWESOME!!!!
ooooh.
anyone in here want a planet side 2 beta ?
08,01that figure doesn't count how long they stayed for
40,000 > 9,000
The game is made by Tim Schafer?! The guy that made The Secreat of Monkey Island?! :O
Mike: it would not orbit the nucleus if it had no charge
Okay, that makes MUCH more sense.
That's amazing. 40,000
Since we kinda pissed off a LOT of Russians. :D
That blows my 25000 viewer prediction for next year out of the water - 50,000!
Ninjazz: We did? :D
haha yeah
Mike: i think its smaller than that
*secret
Jageman: T'was only an example to show what it would be.
dammit this isn't good
0,14if only I had my new computer built >.<
How did we do that? :D
Ninjazz: wait, we did?
:D
AJIsAwesome, you were there weren't you? :p
EQD
They were saying "English, Mothafucka, do you speak it?"
wow you BARELY survived Phase4
Ninjazz: When did it happen? What chat room was it?
game is free 2 play in 10 days anyway
what's this now?
>_<
it's Costume Quest
got accepted in the beta today so yeah
its halo 4
so getting it
Horrible game.
a Halloween themed adventure game/rpg
not particulary happy about it
Because they kept speaking Russian, they kicked them.
Mike: or maybe its a form of matter/energy with a different phase frequency?
Mihoshika: have you played it?
It wasn't a serious statement. :I
0,14...dayum
Nope, but it looks pretty bad.
Are those rides usable?
like 16k, i think?
Mihoshika: what looks bad?
Mike: It would pass through most normal matter easily
Mihoshika: than SHUT UP! I have played it, it's funny and quirky if simple and short. it's not a bad game for that
probably around 3k during the premier
he what time does this stream.... stream new episodes
Mihoshika: oh sorry. want us to add a shotgun and change the view to first person?
hey*
Mike: but still interact with it if there was enough of it
08,01Kinixys: from the data i have, i'd posit around 15,000 for peak simultaneous viewers
I'm not particularily fond of turn-based battles, the graphics are cartoonish, and the text without a voice is annoying.
Also, I don't really like FPS games.
the same time they air on the Hub Haseo
Hi everypony.
Woo!
wb DinkyDoo :)
Hi, DinkyDoo. :)
Jageman: Holy... What if magic is the opposite of Dark matter? It would always exist around us, but we would never know it's there, and some things could interac with it.
and hi :3
so at 10:30?
Mihoshika: the less you need to care bout is the graphics
wb DinkyDoo
00,02Kinixys, there were less in the chat cause ponychats servers wernt ready for the load
Thank you c:
Mihoshika: it's SUPPOSED TO BE CARTOONISH, and what is wrong with that? I like the cartoon artstyle, it's clean and simple.
00,02all sorted for next week though
depends on your timezone but for EST yes
Mike: dark matter does not exist, its just a name for somethings science does not understand yet, thus it has no properties
11,02flutterchu: Moo O3O
That's a bit cold.

Phase4: No doubt. The stream was excellent, but got I got disconnected from chat frequently.
so its 3 hours ahead for me then...
Jageman: It's actually the name for the context of a theoretical black abyss outside of out universe.
Mihoshika: I'm not but you're saying that cartoon artstyle is immediately bad. It's not unless it's a bad style
I pay attention to the chat more than I do to the live stream video.
me too
Mike: where did you read that nonsense
DinkyDoo: welcome to bronystate
00,02this game is :3
so who is streaming?
cachi01: Thanks c:

it's gok
ah
Jageman:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter
I never said that cartoonish graphics were bad, I just gave it as a reason of why I don't like it.
No gak!

Mihoshika: well than that's you, you don't like cartoon esque graphics. Which means you probably didn't like Sly Cooper, Borderlands or any game that made use of cel shading right?
Mike: you misunderstand
Punkie Gak is nickolodeon

I can't believe that people actually remember me o_o.. MIND = BLOWN

thelonepony: don't wearout me gif now
Cupcakes used to be a nice word..

Mike: one that is interesting but unprovable
I'm still going on and on about this xD.
Never played any of those.
oh de ja vu!
DinkyDoo: still is
poor dashy :C
No pony is best pony All ponies are created equally.
I don't intend to play Borderlands, either.
except for Queen Fluttershy
Preach it, Punkie_Pue
Its not a nice word that much anymore cause of Cupcakes.
Jageman:... How long have we been debating?
Mike: too long
/\ - hornboner
~20 mins
I avoid those sorts of things DinkyDoo. Cupcakes is still a nice word to me.
^
I REFUSE TO GO. I LIEK CANDY.
i brb
i've read cupcakes
I had to say that xD.
and cupcakesis still a nice word to me
Mihoshika: well Sly Cooper is a PS2 era 3D platformer and Borderlands is a RPG/FPS hybrid with a focus on a ridiculous amount of randomly generated guns. Try them out, Sly is on PS3 collection and Borderlands is on both consoles as well as PC.
(\_/) WingBoner

okay
Phase4: GO AFTER THE BOMBADIER!

IT WAS A MISTAKEEEEE
SuperClean64?

Don't own a PC, and I've seen Borderlands 2 gameplay, and it looked horrible.
SuperClean64: so excited for the release of the Wii U?

SuperCow64 TO THE RESCUEEEEEEEE
Again, I've seen it.
Mihoshika: play it
SuperCow64 : MMoooOOOooo
SuperCow64. :D
Mike: infinity particle?
I don't play games without a story, anyways.
Mihoshika: then judge it
Mihoshika: have you seen the crap ton of "official" reviews and player reviews that give it good ratings?
Mihoshika: borderands has story
If Cedric from Harry Potter didn't die, we wouldn't have the sparkling-fairy Vampire Edward we have today.
Mihoshika: it has a story, Borderlands 2 has a story. But it's mostly for the loot
DinkyDoo: Your Back!
Jageman: A particle that is and always will be, or basically a bit of matter similar to quarks.
Phase4: THE SHAMAN HEALS! KILL HIM FIRST!
Jageman: Yeah, i'm back!
Guys, I'm gunna go to bed. See you in the morning!

Mike: quarks decay when the quantum strings they are made of runs out of enegy and stops vibrating, accourding to one interpritation of string theory.
Grrrrrrr.
http://a3.typepad.com/6a01287646ac55970c013480e2de2b970c-500pi
math, politics, and now science?
If Cedric from Harry Potter didn't die, we wouldn't have the sparkling fairy-vampire Edward we have today,
Next will be theology?
I can't believe this is made by the guy that made BUCKING Monkey Island. :O
you forgot religion class this morning DRHUnleashed
Mike: unless there is a level inbetween quark, and quantum strings or membrains
So uh, anybody have a time turner?
oh, oops
Or doctor whooves?
no
11,02Gak in the day, we used to watch Rocko's Modern Life :D

Mike: the level at which we have seen ponies do magic, even moving a star like the sun, is not enough energy to control and maintain quantum strings

Mihoshika: so do many

Looking back at it maybe I should have said something in the chat joking about "Ooh boy, there's s going to be a bunch of Gak spam if they do that during the new episodes." That would have been some amusing forshadowing

I bet there's a large changeling population in Los Pegasus
I'm not obsessed with gak.

Oh, that
oh i have this game
DinkyDoo: also, stop hogging all the cutie mark or no more muffins
I throw my hooves up in the air sometimes, saying ay-o! I'm a unicorn-o!
i think the only way to make everyone stop talking about it...is that we force a mod to say "SHUT UP WITH THIS GAK!!!!!!!!!!"
MicTheMicrophone: Basically the Hub overplays ads for Nickelodeon's Gak toy over and over, to the point they actually played *four ads* in a row
0,14Mihoshika, no non-image links during stream please
testing
:S :S :S
Jageman: I can't help it, the creators of My Little Pony did this..
guys...
...
Jageman: But fine, i'll try to keep only one cutie mark..
Shit I lost my work
:-(
00,02he'll be fine there
00,10hmmm the formating is wrong in it som how
I don't recall there NOT being a stream, though.

That complicates things greatly. We're killing off a decent meme to spite a forced one.
LOL
guys... what do you think
Ohai Sumi.
(\/\/) alicorn boner
DinkyDoo: i know you can't help it, but at least try
what if the producers of gak knew we were going to see it so they payed the hub to show it 4 times
Sumica: it is because gak is our new god, there is no escape
Jageman: I'll try.
o.o
Ja?
maybe mr_anybody
the gyrobowl worshipeprs will fall
THE LUNA GAMES: The end is neigh.
Jageman?
:O
twilight_sprinkle: dari will have you hanged by moring
DinkyDoo: good, heres a blueberry muffin
00,10no it's just i fail at formating
MicTheMicrophone: When it happened during the Season 3 premiere, people went crazy over the ads playing over and over and started spamming and making fun of it it and it blew out of control into a chat spam meme
My god is not Gak, my god is Hanyuu :D

SaxyPretender: aight
If Cedric from Harry Potter didn't die, we wouldn't have the sparkling fairy-vampire Edward we have today.
I was asked a question about changeling equality in equestria
DinkyDoo: they make better imposters then stalkers
Jageman: True..

Gyrobowls is my lord and savior. Through His indestrible structure, I will never spill.
I need a time turner!

NYC_Brony: bronystate obviously

who is the guy that does the strams?
The letter "G" in both lower case and upper case formats is now a bannable symbol.

Okay can some mod explain to me WHY my survey link didn't work AT ALL?
AdamTheDuck, ARGH. Too beautiful.
Phase4: about upcomming or released?
hey phase can we watch some rerurns?

08,01gak is not bannable
Phase4: one of my childhood gavorites :3
08,01unless you're being really really obnoxious with it
NYC_Brony: Various mods stream. Sumica does the new episode streams
00,10otakon shit broke

so if we use the letter g anytime we;re banned? D:
NYC_Brony: bronystate wins, goign to bronycon doesn't make you special :3
Ninjazz: i'll never link you another rarity pic again, gyrobowl worshipper :I
Sumica: thanks that explains so much, it happen to anyone else or just me?
Anyone caught using the symbol "G" in any format will be banned and probably slapped around with a trout or something I dunno what the hell they do.

Phase4: i took a course in digital design fundementals
I'm wearing a brooklyn nets hat
00,02twilight_sprinkle, actually no, that is the formula sheet for the exam
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Music of the Day #23
AdamTheDuck: positive and negative charges, to be put simply
Phase4: oh, thank god :P
brb
Phase4: was my favorite class ever
hey play some xcom
00,02Jageman, digital design and magnetics are VERY different :P
http://cheezburger.com/6591216640 today
00,02but yeah, digital design is fun
hey hey hey
AdamTheDuck: not in the slightest
And friendship is magic, therefore magnets is friendship.

brb
I LOVE VETERANS!
/me mind melts from teh maths
00,02nice and strange
my grandpa is one
00,10play running man gta style

Phase4: cant you just say magnetic field unit over m^2?
00,02Jageman, the amazing part is how simple it all is
electron movement is uncalculanle though...
13i wonder how mods figure into multiplayer
00,02twilight_sprinkle, magnetic flux

00,02Shizuka, depends on how physics differences are solved

you just need to make a zip file in the root of the tf2 game. new patch? unzip.
TF2!
00,10so you have the texture but not the model

your argument is invalid
Mr_Anybody, pfft, what you want to do is print trollface.jpg stickers, then place then under the laser of the mouses so when people go to use the computers, they'll lift their mouse over and see a trollface.
Mr_Anybody: its fun to troll in real life
http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/347/056/419.png ^
we don't have laser mouses we have the old roll mouses
old computers are old
Mr_Anybody, hmm, it'll still work.
Trackball mouse?
i remember when a friend of mine drew a trollface mask and walked around school in it
wow there's halo for atari? I though it was xbox exclusive

00,10So I was checking the log fils for the new ep?
00,10er not a question
00,10but yeah. mane chat log file was 10 mb
00,02rainbow from absolutely nowhere
00,10and the dash room for the hour it was open is 1 mb
It was some special thing they did
Those crazy spamming fools.
00,02Sumica, i got a raw packet log, weighed in at about 6MB
it didnt actually come out in the 80s
well there were also chat problems
so Sumica how much kicks so far for gák?
00,02but it was on the quiet side of the netsplit afaik
oh
00,10aye
but i printed to many and jammed the printer
00,10keep in mind my side room logs dont include joins and parts
they didn't know who did it though :D
