Barack Obama

There is no reason that should be as funny as it was
Yaaaaaaaay!
I'm pretty sure she missed the moon, every time.
/me suggested it ^_^
lol
I see why ou would eek, lordcelestia is quite heavy
04Guys
death battle
I don't think anyone who saw that the first time expected it to be that funny
Hey! Thats my Suggestion!!!
Death Battle?
08,1is there a stream or all you just going crazy?
AW YEAH
yay
Obama, cuz ain't got no other choice.
aw yeah
one of the best brony creations eve
hey Ghosties
04I'm trying to do you all a solid
THIS ONE IS WIN BTW!
awesome :)
theres a stream
go go power rangers
It's an awesome stream!
04Hopefully, it'll work
Oh, she did.
04Wish me luck
glhf
and that's what we would get if the people who made Aqua Teen Hunger Force wrote for MLP
08,1Ghosties o-o
oh dear
this is amazing
08,1Hi
so good
And the meteor show in All's Well That Ends Well was all of them falling back to Equestria.
04Hey, Fluttershy
yes. yes it is
We all know RD would win
Ghost has a more convincing Texas accent.
....
the depth of RB's powerset is frikken hilarious
08,1I have a question....
My money's on Rainbow Dash.
Of course. :D
08,1for all of you...
this was a surprisingly good video
starscream is too busy stabbing his own team in the back, and rainbow is loyalty pony
08,1since I missed the stream
04BE HAPPY
04SERIOUSLY
08,1what in the world was 'Babes in Toyland' even about?
oh god, fluttershy'
04YOU HAVE NO IDEA
be very very grateful
She is, after+ all, 20% cooler! ;)
VERY HAPPY!
no idea
OMG
NO ONE KNOWS!
spider's web is no longer worst movie
That movie had a story?
this battle was over before it started. starscream is incapable of winning anything fairly.
08,1no
It was Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
08,1I wasn't here o-o
like CCBB
I knew she was a black belt but I didnt notice she wore the belt OVER her wings untill this vid
What is waifu?
/me places a hoof over Fluttershy`s mouth. DONT EVEN ASK.
you dont wanna know
08,1>>;
Plus, she's practically indestructible. LOL
Finally someone
that means she doesnt need her wings to kick ass
donk
waifu is a wapanese term for a female character one likes A LOT
04Just don't question it
Is the sound/audio lagging slightly at times for anyone else?
04Seriously
04Don't
picture the script of MLP G1 combined with Spider's web and spread out over 140 minutes
04Be glad you weren't here
he always has a sore throat
08,1errrmm.... okay.....?
only problem I really have for this vid is that RD's voice isn't that good.
140 minutes? I never saw that version
It's kind of a joke
until now
08,1lol how did we even get such a movie as the b choice anyway?
TheMaster, you mean Starscream is incapable of winning, period.
WHAT THE F***
I always thought "waifu" was a way of saying "my wife".
oh japan, you so crazy
WEHPIE
04It's a goddamn travesty that film was 140 minutes long
that was longer than 140 minutes
what
Silly Japan
Mahpie or w/e picked it
I liked starscream in armada
he was more sympathetic
04Mahpie?
someone else liked Armada?
ya me too
04Is that the name we have?
it is, but the wapanese are amusing
I did!
I thought I was the only one
i liked the minicrons
04Mahpie is on my permanent kill list
So no sound drop outs correct?
Ah, I see.
6Lol,hey :P
hooved Karate would be badass
laughing so hard
6How you doin'?
lol, so amazing it can't be shown
Lol
Great
"this guy"
working on a blog
ahaha I love that guy's photo
6:O
calculations according to THIS GUY
lol
08,1now Ghosties we can't go killing viewers :<
his expression is so perfect
I got prostate chat on my phone
Seems Legit.
paper thin detective plot spread over 140 minutes
disregard females; acquire ponies
Fluttershy, Mehpie wasn't a viewer
"why is it so awesome" ha
04But Fluttershy....
2http://dragonnewsnetwork.blogspot.com/
Sarcastic guy understands now.
he ditched us before it even started
he's no viewer
sup with the lg?
08,1hmmm
04You don't understand
lag*
08,1love and tolerate Ghosties
04It was bad
yeah, I side with Ghosties
08,1love and tolerate
he did that to us on PURPOSE
04I don't love and tolerate
love and tolerate Mahpie...
TO DEATH
"let's make it fight a giant robot"
08,1:<
6:3
commercial incoming
Dang Ads!
fluttershy, you just don't understand
04I've been that way since Brony State started
I'm assuming lottery will be on Fridays from now on.
also, >mfw this is fluttershy's modeling music
Ze Magiks
04But I do act within human reason
04And that ......THING
Ghosties, I wanna thank you and all the other mods that were helping tonight be so awesome. I had fun (except for the B movie)
04No
then some crappy flash animation...
/me disapproves of not loving and tolerating >_>
i remember everyone thought that they'd be horribly biased against mlp before this vid
04It does not DESERVE any kind of love or toleration
you can only love and tolerate so much
that movie
The thing is, Mehpie only picked BiTL, he never said what version.
what is mahpie
Are you talking about MLP the first movie? Or did I miss something?
i r confused
04HE IS THE NEW ENEMY
i'm gonna love and tolerate the s*** out of you
Mehpie is the new Tacowiz
This is epic.
They should have gotten DRSMOOV to do Starscream.
2I'm not taking over the world with spyro and or ponies
Taste the rainbow MOTHERF****ER!
TAG, YOU'RE IT
2 hits on RD.
04I task every Brony State viewer with hunting down and destroying Mehpie
cannot. stop. laughing
actually this is kinda alright
challenge accepted, ghosties
04Or bring him in alive for more monies
Good luck catching her, Starscream.
dat face
08,1seriously what was the movie even about? OKAY. If there is one word you could use to describe the movie, what would it be?
was it Mehpie or Mahpie?
Starscream gets his ass thuroughly handed to him
Theres Derpy!
04UN BABES
If you have Android phone, free IRC is andchat, useful for when page chat lags under load during streamed eps
uh.... shit?
DEATH
I don't know who htese peop;e. what's the story behind mahpie?
Mehpie vs Tacowiz, who's worse?
DERPY!
that's the word
Awful
lol @ Derpy in the background
PWNED
lol Derpy
im sure that she is at least 20% Cooler :P
Mahpie chose babes in toyland
im using andchat
failray from starscream
This... Is epic beyond belief.
nice
04Mehpie
Tornainbow!
04Easily
6No world domination? :3
lol this is my favorite part
and what did tacowiz do?
Ha ha! Go Dashie! :D
his wing rips off
04At least I *laughed* at Spider's Web
Wing Damaged!
DENIED
where did they get the voices?
I... I'm so happy right now.
what's spider's web?
I have B movie suggestion
04I legitimately laughed at Spider's Web
The lottery was randomly done last Saturday after gurren lagan this is what happened.
2Maybe
Tacowiz made us watch Spiders Web
he is 16.6% less cool that Rainbow Dash
what was Spider's Web like?
EVERYTHING
boob missiles!
howdy y'all
Last minute sonic rainboom!
BOOOOM!
and who saw the rainboom coming from a mile away
howdy pardner
2Anyways you should join
that said, it was still awesome
It was horrible, I can't decide if it was worse than Babes though.
04Think Charlotte's Web...but dragged through the mud, riddled with racist stereotypes, and then sent straight to hell
and they even used the music for it
:0
I was giddy at this video
G1 Starscream vs G3 Rainbow Dash
Oh, all kinds of awesome. Sonic Rainboom of death! LOL
Miracle Dogs Too
6Sure ^^
08,1we're going to have to watch 'Little Shop of Horrors' sometime ;3
saw it coming
nom!
omnomnom
Hey
Starscream is now inside Rainbow Dash...
tovler Starscream would laugh himself to death
trapped in the belly of a pony forever
She ate Starscream?
2,14 well hello
STARSCREAM YOU HAVE FAILED ME FOR THE LAST TIME
I can now sleep soundly knowing RD is not dead
That was beautiful.
lolwut
and thus, Loyalty overcomes Betrayal
this is the most awesome thing ever
2see what happen was
Mild indigestion. LOL
2i made a blogger account
AWWWWW YEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAHHHHHH!
13Hmm, I didnt say anything all night hardly. lol
that was actually pretty good
woo
Heck, even a microwave can kill Starscream
13So busy.
starscream's spark is coming out in a pile of pony crap
Ghosties, I wanna thank you and all the other mods that were helping tonight be so awesome. I had fun (except for the B movie)
She put the PWN in PWNy
So is this here broadcast goin' up in the mornin'?
2Uxie said wait before making a website
/me hugs Octavia
>Transformers fans face when
Master Chief vs... Fluttershy
Was there ever any doubt that Rainbow would win?
2and i kinda made a test
that was actually better then expected
08,1o-o
08,1what about me?
2which came into this
o.O
6:O
/me hugs Revolver back
not at all
You should take the night off for your birthday Octavia
Fluttershy sicks a dragon on MC
Bayformers Starscream was killed by Shia LaBouf. That's WAY more embarrasing
I thought you werent here...?
but I thought they were going to make something of the loyalty factor, which is their biggest difference
fluttershy
/me hugs Fluttershy`
08,1I AM HERE
13Anyways, I'm headed off here for tonight. G'night ponehs. :)

04You guys remember Axel Foaley?

Hmmm
Good movie, too.

MAGIC, I AIN'T GOTTA EXPLAIN SHIT

7:29:56
What is is, I don't even...
lawl Pinkie is the spawn of loki
it all makes sense
You know what
Fluttershy happens to be my fave room
I just realized that
well
ax dancen
I joined right before you said that
lol
If you like classic movies, with lots of good singing, you might like Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.
Is it bad that i actually like this movie?
no
watching that guy swing that axe around makes me wonder how many times it's launched out of his hands
oh boy somebody gave the DM of the Rings treatment to MLP
this has the potential to be awesome
lol
well good
happypony That. Would. Be. AMAZING
This is one of the slower songs in that movie
Lots of great colors, lots of good music. Good story. Worth seeing.
hmmm, I count six brothers....
It was originally thirty four brothers for seven wives. The axe swinging helped with that.
Gummy!
A TRUE HERO
GUMMY!!!!!!!
:D
lmao
lawl this music
/me is crying manly tears
Gummy, our savior!
NO^
2oh ok
The Smithsonian says "watch that move"
*equestria
lol
My request. No need to thank me.
*movie*
Duh, sorry.
He can be my assistant ruler
A true hero of our times! A mans man! As if there could be more than one Gummy!
/me showers aponymous with praise
/me salutes
2Now they can have roles or so
Gummy is destined to be a mighty warrior.
Just who the hell do you think he is!?
i for one welcome our new Gummy overlords
screw frog
hey, can we still post .jpg images?
gummy is the true hero
Gummy says "Deal with it"
2Post maker like me we get into the news
Hes truly a man of few words
Gummy! :D
at least he's not doing the bedroom eyes
2Coding User who give me code so we can add to it
2or someone who posts art
/me bows to gummy
For the Eurostream, you should just show this for two hpurs instead of Babes in Toylasnd.
or bathtub eyes
*salutes*
/me kneels
creon77 wins 1 internet for that
/me bows
oh boy
it's just struck me that RD and AJ are the only ones without pets or other mall creatures
where's DCD
2we are sometime in the future going to be doing arts and stuff
Polarfire! <3
yay my second request
lol kamen
wait my first one didnt appear
this isn't ponily relevant
DCD was here last week. It was awesome.
2Like fan stuff
hahaha
They have little fillies. Applebloom and Scootaloo. Pretty much the same thing.
6Yeah
Not pony, but awesome.
he's studdying hard and such
Needs to be synched with ponies
Tension!
lol point
i dont think it has to be Pony Related
completly agreed
nice suit though
Rarity has both
2It's not "Your Hub for everything Spyro." for nothing
japanese iron man
I would wear that suit to work.
I miss the Gokaiger preshows.
She needs an accessory to go with every outfit.
6Lolz :P
indeed
ahh japanese angst
....lol
2Anyways you want a role?
how we love thee
6Sure :3
2ok let me list them off
mac10 and a milkcan?
suddenly guitars
Batussi!
RoboCop needs to come back
When is all this ending? i wanna stay to the end
although, win guitar is win
robocop was better when he was bucaroo banzi
So apparently, sketching character action poses for class + Bronystate = terrible for work ethic
2The Post Maker or admin as some know it does all sorts of Admin stuff like blocking trolls to editing/making posts
at least the red Youtube bar shows us how much longer it last
when I get tired LordCelestia
Plus. You've seen how her cat responds to her.
/me should not have had that pizza. All those carbs are keeping him awake.
that is normal for cats
those classy suits
Mm. I cut out most of my carbs. I miss pizza. :(
I had a pizza too
.
Yup. Unless their with fluttershy.
I exist on a diet of burgers and pizza
All backup dancer should wear tuxedos and top hats.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY
They only need a monicle to look even more classy
lol
ugh, that sound quality
2The Rp Admin makes a post and watchs that post and everyone rps in the comments
lol osu
I'm going to open a strip club where all the women wear monocles.
dafuq is that game?
Mine was a stuffed pizza so it has twice the everything.
who in god's name is playing that
X_0
lol
that's either sped up
lol
or someone is transhuman
Val you have faild me >_<
what's with the whistle
2The RP Admin can do the same as the admin but it's there job to set rules and watch posts for the rps
or it's a machine
nah the sound was made like that on purpose
I wish I could go to a hipster stripclub instead of the usual redneck ones
is this osu!?
well it sounds terrible
it clears up
this player is god
hey....the gameplay reminds me of Elite Beat Agents
2And then the Mods
yup, it's on auto
thats cz it is
what is this game?
an open source version at least
It is augmentation.
Now I want the Twilight Learns to DJ video
I dont know... but now I want to
this looks macroed
cool
2They are like the best they have no real power but watch the comments and stuff and tell Admins
its running on auto
i think the free version is osu
This is definitely not a real person.
every perfect play in a rhythm game looks macroed...
cuz its freaking impossible to do for real
theres a little icon under the score that say its running in auto
6Heh,I think I'll go with the mods :P
man, this guy has spider-man reflexes!
right under the percent
yfw we have dari again?
He almost has LotusTeaDragon reflexes!
we've seen japanese do impossible gaming feats
oh XD
2ok
When did he come back?
I thought he forgot about us for awhile
The movement of the cursor is a dead giveaway that it's not a real person.
ah.
oh this video
that jogged his memory XD
yay, another one of my suggestions :D
yes this video
the first time I saw this I was like 'LAWL DAT PITCH'
*puts on hat* I must now hunt for that game!
lol
This video gets played every week
/me 2needs to write this done
2*down
for good reason
trivia. this was sped up exactly 20%
be grateful it's not anthology for the billionth time
Dance f**ker dance
This is awesome.
/me dances
Yes... dance my f***ers, DANCE! :D justkidding
Rainbow Dash is Pop-Punk.
You're gonna go far, kids :)

Ooh. You need to see it, Aponymous.
I am so happy
I haven't ever seen the whole thing
I've seen bits and pieces
I wonder if he's asleep already.
That good?
which were all fantastic, so I'd love to marathon it sometime
perhaps once i get better conection and we can show....shows again.
I keep telling myself I need to see this.
I saw bits and pieces until I found a complete set at our local library. Watched them all in one night. Awesome.
perhaps!
dari-beep?
I accidentally saw the last episode without any context
:O
I loved Champloo and Michiko to Hachin
dari
so I was like 'lolwut'
this is brillant
but it was STILL good
welp
and even the katakana was right
The guy who made this is god
noo
Oh, yeah. It's got tons of story. It could have gone on longer, too.
That trumpet at the end was always my favorite.
oh i guess he's sleepin.
eeyup
I love watching series finales without any context.
And he should be, its almost 7 there I think XD
So. . . what was the movie schedule?
dat uncanny valley
dat yakuza face
he's gotta rest up for new poni after all
this guy doesn't look real
Next week is a secret suprise
6Ok
You say that... But he's a Brony.
Oh yeah. what time is that tomorrow?
Guys, id love to stay longer, but I need to be able to wake up tomorrow for ep. 2
We watched Batman Begins and *Shudders* Babes in Toyland

not too bad actually.
I'm a regular
2Although if your part of any thing or stuff that likes spyro maybe post the link to the page
Is this the intermission?
it finally cooled off some.
Yeah sumica is
lawl this again
Or are we just waiting?
I'm here often, but I don't know if I'd be considered a "regular".
I come here rather often, but there's usually little to no action here when I come
becoming a regular...
also y u no in #lobby
2We do need members
I mean ppl who are here every day
I used to be kind of regular. . .
Bah, I was hoping for Wall-E. Incredibles is epic but it's not priceless
that's what she said
Oh nevermind.
I think they're just gonna play random videos, and then maybe S2E1 again
we started using it for BMN now, not just S2 apparently
around 80-ish for the game, and actually kinda cold on the way home.
Incredibles is more popcorny
before the stream starts
still fantastic though
Im going to try to be here every friday
and then we'll see like 15 minutes of strawberry shortcake
Popcorn is more incredible!
yay
You know, I was never a big fan of The Incredibles. It's good, but, just not my flavor.
ah that's cool.
they need a sequel to increadables
Invredibles was ok
one is coming
yeah, not... cars.
Untreadables
I'm still waiting for a priceless episode of ponies.
lol
and hopefully the stream won't choke and die like it did last time, when we had to go an emergency, low-quality last resort
in the wors alegedly
I didn't even see Cars 2, it looked terrible
I loved Cars. I liked it better than The Incredibles.
works*
6I'll try getting some peoples off the forum :3
....I misspelled again..*facehoof*
Well i'm in the procss ofcoming a mod (fopefully) so you'll be seeing more of me
liking the chearleaders
2ok
I'm watching a professional wrestler fight a cannon turtle.
if yuore not a regular that it
yeah
Cars was ok. I don't understand the hate. I've not seen Cars 2.
*is
DIS PLOT
apparently too many bronies stampeded it into the ground
2Also if it looks like it's dead don't tell Uxie
cars wasn't bad
2She'll kill me
This music is like a punch to the spleen, but the ladies. Lovely.
it was just kinda meh
I really liked Cars 1 but Cars 2 was just... bad imo
it was fun though, we barely needed it cuz #bronystate was pretty sparse
I loved cars 1
although the ending part of the race was really good
6Ok :P
Starscream is a loser. BIG TIME.
havnt deen cars 2
that was the one part of the movie that really felt pixarish
I want to see Cars 2, just to see if the shock and gasping was justified.
seen*
Cars was meh for me, havent watch cars 2 so I cant judge it
six-way?
where he stops at the finish line
Ive seen this!
I've driven through the actual town where Cars was based off of.
lawl this
lol
Cars was good, I still consider it the worst of Pixar's movies though
lol
i heard that was cuz there wasn't the usual EqD post about us this week
oh god...
Lol. This'll be good.
6Brb,I want some toast :P
Ratatouille was the worst in my opinion
Win
so what's the BEST pixar flick?
Well, in my opinion, Pixar's worst is better than most people's best.
ratatouille was okay
lmao
All this cars talk made me want to play Putt-Putt (and Pajama Sam)
the ending was hilarious
you know when I first saw this video I was expecting rage>_<
lol
hahaha this always makes my day :D
Thats how I was when S2 Episode 1 Started
You would think he would be WATCHING.
hellbeapampalo
2ok
I felt so bad about last week.
this is me right now, lol
I was squeeing so hard
Best? Tough choice... I'll be cliche and go with WALL-E though.
he'll be a pampalo
2i might also be resting my eyes
but I never thought discord was goign to suck
You'd think he just ate a Lobster Tail pastry.
Can you blame them though?
I just didn't expect Q
that is how I would have been if I hadnt slept though it
lol
who is Q
no skrillex?
anyways?
only ones I blame are the video servers that weren't meant for heavy use
go watch TNG
first episode
tng???
are we skipping all my dubstep?
:(
Q is a trickster god-type creature from Star Trek
-_-
the next generation
Wait. I know that voice
Thanks to MLP I know who Q is!
Star Trek The NExt Generation
Next Generation, Voyager, and Deep Space 9
thats all i needed 2 know
hahah
Oh, I remember that chills ran down my back the second I heard that voice. LOL
dat lyps sink
Q
LOL
!
Q!
DAAAAHHHH!!!!
I am sure they just said act like Q for discord.
and this video is SO SPOT-ON
Q!Q!Q!Q!Q!Q!Q!Q!Q!Q!Q!Q!Q!
Q!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Q!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I almost heard "Did you miss me Picard?" when he first said it because I knew immediately who it was. LOL
sounds about right
It really is.
I wonder what came first, Discord or the casting decision
Q!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I just realized Discord has a meowing umbrella.
NO NO NO!
lmao
Does all this Q talk intimidate people who've never seen Star Trek?
Best villain ever
I'm still struggling to watch all of TNG
That is how I felt
Agreed. Best villain ever.
the first season is so awful
WTF?
OMG season gap
yes
I LOVE IT
0_0
what is this 0.o
yes
my request
i think thats how we all felt lol
I... CANT.... CONTAIN.......
well....this is odd
THE WWWWWWWWWWWWWWIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What is the guy singing?
Never saw Star Trek, not intimidated though. Might start watching TNG afterwards actuall.
lol
if you start TNG
that was short lived...
at the end "Up Next! My Little Pony!" COULD IT BE!!!? "Rerun"
be warned, the first season is abominable
damn.
yes those are the actual character names
There are some good first season episodes.
Never saw..... How LONG were YOU trapped om the moon?
pomf
Datalore was okay
YEAH!
but... code of honor... *shudder*
Twilight is like: What. the. buck.
Oh god, "Code of Honor".
and Wesley is wesley
6Back
this is my JAM! lol
6:O
so there's that
all right I better head to bed now
The only Star Trek I watched was that reboot movie, which was okay.
every time I see those sweaters of his I feel like punching him
getting up early for disQord's second and possibly final appearance
This video makes me want to smoke pot and breakdance on a pile of Doritos.
this is my jelly
for a laugh, look up "USS Make Sh*t up" by voltaire
and picard's kind of a dick for season one, lol
Star Trek was the shit since I didn't have cable for the longest time.
OH BOY

AustinWolfclaw, I recomend looking in to cravingexplorer.

Definitely staying up all night.

I threw it on the ground
There's a month gap or so between Episode 2 and episode 3, I thought.
Dude.
God I hope not
If there is.
Even if there is, better 2 and 3 than 1 and 2.
Im going to kill everypony.
my guide is probably wrong it's reqaly oonly good for one week.
I waited four months for S2
Oh, agreed, ReisenInaba.
I threw it on the ground
Imagine waiting a month between episode 1 and 2.
I can survive
My dads not a cell phone!

this song sounds like it could be a part of a gameboy game
get any sleep at all then?
ive mmorized every word to ths song and ive nver looked up the lyrics ever....
I wonder why that is.
its because it is 8 bit ass
I think that's the idea.
I remember when just this song was leaked
if they still made gameboy games
all that speculation
8 bit ass? I remember that from back in my 286 strip poker days.
I got about 3-4 hours I think.

:[:[ I HATE THIS SONG :[:[
One of the only musicals I like.
i use to dislike musicals but then I saw rocky horror
lol doctor horrible
and now I realize their potential
why not brand new day?
Doctor Who?
different doctor
I didn't care much for Rocky horror honestly.
or bad horse's theme?
this is my favorite song from horrible
4Derpy sucks.
/me runs away
High School Musical made musicals suck balls. Then MLP said FUCK THAT! and made musicals awesome again.
I like Brand New Day better...
I would go insane if they made a offhand doctor who reference in season 2
It's ok Aponymous, Luna is asleep you are safe.
This guy is trying to undo what MLP did
Woo, thats a relief.
13NU HUH
Eh. I love Neil Patrick Harris.
Brand New Day was my favorite Dr Horrible song.
13SHES FRIGGIN HAWT
you're allowed to dislike/not care for rocky horror
he's in the next harold and Kumar.
Neil is cool
hes in all the harold and kumars
hes in every harold and kumar :P
I still want 10 milliom fluttersys. Just because.
I'm actually not a fan of the Harold and Kumar movies.

Lots of weirds are good weirds.

It's not hard to find.

PEACH!
who wants to watch some stupid dubs of a obviously superior anime pony show
*had...
as much as i dislike anime, i cant help but apperciate that
why?
As an anime, this show would be dismissed as cute crap.
You GOTTA show Peach after that!
to this vid. not you creon77
Yeah, this is about right.
they're so depressing
haha
oh now i get it
lol
BUZZ KILL!
Aw. :(
lmao
/me knows that feel
instant sadness
as much as I hate animal abuse people don't watch tv to get depressed
feels bad pony
/me feels boner kill
godamn depressing commercials
/me feels bad man...
/me anti boner achieved
lmao
inwards
:'(
We always get these commercials during parties
YES :D
Best apology ever.
it's more awkward than depressing.
How was the other movie?
Hi, We are the ASPCA. We will make you feel insanely guilty... but not enough to actually donate.
might as well just start showing clips of the holocaust
Actually depressing commercials freak the shit out of me for some reason...
These and the Children's hospital commercials. Sometimes one right after the other.
no. just never outward
yes!
:D
Another I've seen. =3
this is awesome!
Old
still funny
:D
Yay more renard
Okay this is getting dangerously close to being one of the videos I actually have open right now.
or Furries in a blender...
i have not seen this before.
How was Babes in Toyland
awful
Another one I'ev gotta find and favourite
awfull
/me rages at mention of Babes in Toyland
this is WONDERFUL :D
i've seen date movie and that was better
not this but Babes in Trolland
Babes in Toyland was amazing. Better than Black Dynamite.
wtf does he have so many names anyway?
so much fluttershy :3
yes yes and more yes
date movie > babes in toyland
Notepad... never forget
:[
Babes in Toyland? Ummm... I'm going with "Horrible"
worse then last weeks B movie?
the mlp movie was entertaining in its badness
wat was last weeks again?
ANY Seltzerberg movie > Babe in Toyland
so bad it was good
g1 ponies?
Well, I'm out for the night folks. It's 3:16 AM here and if I want to see the show, I have to get sleep.
MLP movie was at least short.
Yeah, the MLP!movie was so bad it was hilarious, this was just...
night lotus
i set my alarm
Bye Lotus
Goodnight! :)
so there's some way to automate these videos with a MIDI file, assigning a short video clip to each instrument right? what program do people use?
see ya in 4 hours :P
hurtful
g'night
night lotus
Night
so if i go to bed at 5 i'm sure to be up at 8
This video?
they use Vegas Pro
you too lag! night
all of them
Seltzerberg is worser quality, but they aren't 2 hours and 20 minutes long.
I'd assume Sony Vegas Pro, yeah.
lol
Most YTPMVs are made with the-
My request again
i Hate her.
YOU WENT AND DID IT
Wait, what is...?
PLAYED A VIDEO I HAVE OPEN
>_<
The fandom is going to rage when trixie doesn't show up in season 2
4SQUISHY
lol
YAY!
The fandom wasn't promised trixie
Actually played cod to this and i could quick scope like crazy...
only seth will rage
I hope Trixie shows up in season 2.
Trixie is already reported to NOT be in season 2
i wont. Trixie was an arrogant ****. I wanna see that gryphon again
No wanjht trixie.
I was see Gryphon land
what I want to see is the luna episode basically involve luna trying to speak, only to be interrupted every time.
except for the last one and she gets to say "hi"
Gilda was even worse... she made Fluttershy cry :'(
trixie was just doing her job
but quick scope is for fags who cant sit still
ILOVE trixie!
shes just so hammy
pony bleach
Herjob to be a jerk?
Gilda was bland, she is every bully in every 90s high school movie ever.
THIS GUY IS GOD OF GODS!
oh this one is the only ne i havnt seen yet
What more can they add with trixie?
I got the impression that Trixie's talent was stage-show magic in the first place
Beautiful
i used to not like Gilda, but after reading that "Gilda becomes a city guard" fic, i'd really like to see a redemption / character development episode for her
Best PMV EVER.
i think Gryphon land should be called Thiarry and its located the skys of another non-pony country lol
yes
She'd end up like The Rowdy Ruff Boys, added just because... fans.
I would call that country...Predditarius
13no
Gotta rewatch all the old bleach episodes...
eh, I didn't complain. any episode with HIM is always good
yes
he was my favorite in ppg as far as villians go
just the first few seasons
4Why?
BOOM.
I liked Mojo Jojo more
nothing with the dolls or the arrancrs
oh shit. this should be good
I am almost done here, Dari will be takeing over soon and i will be back around 5am pst for ep 201 and the live 202.
OH SHIIIIIIT!
hey
do they still make new boondocks episodes?
yes
hello, im guessing today episode 2 will be streamed
correct
WIN!
this is my favorite ww2 related movie ever
sweet
Season 4 of Boondocks probably won't be until 2013. Meanwhile have some Black Dynamite.
Hells brigade
best ending ever
more or less Tovler
My request. This video got me into Ponies.
Oh Canada, eh?
I love this movie.
Mah-gah-reigh-deeeee
and the tragic thing is, I HAVE-- living in the deep south-- seen black epopler act EXACTLY ylike that... and I do not know WHY.
I would show the one that got me hooked but it's 30min long =p
awww. poor Polarfire XD
Inglourious Basterds, I believe the most Antysemetic movie ever
sure you all know and are sick of it
yu men the anthology?
anti-semetic?
The one that got me hooked was EP 1
how do you figure?
yes Lagmobile
A movie where Jews kill Hitler is anti semetic?
It was the kym vid for me
other than making the nazis semi-sympathetic occasionally
A group of People tromenting Jews
and that was really only the one soldier guy
YT sad hey you liked amv hell try this
did we watch the same movie flaschen?
and that's how i became a brony.
actully i showed it to a freaind and the nxt day he had seen like 5 episodes so i gave in
Jews tormenting german soldiers
what the hell, a swazzie cutiemark?

http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/d3f7a107-22ad-461b-88ac-fe88c1cf1b9f.jpg
Lol, couldn't believe we were an hour and a half into the movie and Luna said there was still "an hour left"
had to reload
oh
Notepad > Magneto
all right!
there how about this
mind of freeman?
what this?
With how the viewership dropped during it. if it played first no one would have watched Batman.
oh man i love this
never got around to watching this
thanks
I still think magneto is best pony
movie?
no sound though
well you guys are here early : P
lol i cant hear anything
early?
Freeman's Mind...? Stream, y u so make me remember things I haven't seen in ages?
freemans mind is as silent as he is
Magnegro is best black supervillain
no sound
oh sorry
yeah shouldn't there be like sound?
we never went to bed :P
x D
im mad became a brony the day before that magneto thing happened, i was too busy watching the episodes to find this place
its nearly 2 am here...
5 hours till episode 2!
haha
what won't you do for ponies
it didn't happen here
…I think I need to sleep...
YES DESKTOP PONIES!!!!
Im going to bed soon though

where did it happen super?
freeman's mind!
HOLY CRAP YES

FREEMANS MIND!
the time is 3:51 am
were they watching it here?
I wish it was 8:47
yous should have the ponies walking around on the stream
twilight is the best pony

staying up several hours past your bedtime does seem a little extreme
So anyway, I was telling my friend, "So anyway, I was chatting with all these Bronies online and…"
it was bronyville
/me goes back to sleep a bit before S2E2
SPIKE IS BEST PONY

Spike Jonze is best director
hehe obsession?

Cya
damn vac, stop droping my sound.
i still think doom>halflife
I had to tell him that there was nothing wrong with myself and I was still not completely obsessed with Ponies
my only obssession is, my ease in which i become addicted to a book, and my love of fallout
so fallout equestria has been my addiction
Anyway guys, time for roleplaying, I'll be Rainbow Dash >_<
/me has never played Half life
school

But I have no regrets
spam bot swinging the kick hammer.
Ban cannon
im not suprised i got hit by the spam
filter*
nah takes like 5 spam kicks to get a spam ban

I prefer who crossovers, wish there were more. I also like progress
well im giong to bed now
goodnight!
I have to keep fighting the urge to fullscreen the video.
this is the longest game intro ever
Who crossovers are hit and miss. 12/Traveler and Time Lords &Terror/Mines of Dragon Mountain are awesome though.
well master to point out what i like about FO:E, i love FO3 and know alot of it, and FiM is awesome, the author blends them together amazingly
one of the best too
if yu want t talk to some fellow insomnacs go to #bronystate
Valve = masters of games
Timelords and terror and dragon mountain are indeed awesome
: D
the problem is most people don't really know who
will do
everyones talking in there
but they cant count to 3
Going to bed now guys
o/

There was one, it had Who too.
Sumica is.

Sumica: Happy Birthday!
I love this part
thats amazing

*needs to learn to be more concise, or when to talk when people are into a convo* I had typed up like a speech just now and all that it summed up to was a simple question
not till october =p
Oh boy, nightly roundup!
*facepalms at length of my last post*
/me head bangs
these black mesa guys know how to work
/me joins Sumica in head bang
i've had a roommate who listened to the same katy perry song all night on loop
just coding, the entire time
I would kill him
o.o
what cloud runner said
it was "hot and cold"
seems leget
I woke up to him still coding
oh lord
Wait, was it last friday night?
no, this was like 2 years ago.
I feel like taking the challenge of watching Fluttershy SQUEE for 24 hours straight.
he drank like 4 monsters to
code monkeys need bass to work.
superbrony would that not leave you a eternally happy person?
SuperBrony64 you will get diabetes
How many people do you think will show up for the episode?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z01oLJY_o14 :)
Shadow: It would leave me in the fetal position squeeing to myself.
not as many here
this stream didn't get advertised much on eqd
heh nice
Hard to say Aponymous. I am sure some are wary after my fubar.
its cool, its the community i'm here for.
themaster, ponychan had a nice amount of advertising on it, it convinced me to go to the S2E1 allnighter
We should be watching the playthrough of Vietnamese Pokemon Crystal
I'm guessing it won't be as many as last week after the stream derp last week.
i suggjest sirronlionheart
if we watched a playthrough
SuperBrony; Oh geez, that. XD
or watching rucka rucka ali
SirRon is a great letsplayer

Slau*
i read on EQ:D that ep 3 happens 2 weeks after ep 2
Wilson's not about.
what do you mean .co.cc?
because its camouflage system is broken. and the doctor likes it that way
loery monei
code: The website URL
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT DARI!??!?!?!?!??!?!
FFFFFFFFFFFFU VAC
Are you in www.bronystate.net
YOU RUINED IT!!!!!
flutterz shunt all nonemergency caffine supplies directly into system stat
I've used them all up already...
So many sound under flows
wilson is in michigan giving advice to his neighbor
Apply PONIES directly to forehead for maximum coverage.
good night Flutterz
Is the sound ok, by the way?
both the emergency and non-emergency
The time machine can turn into stuff to blend in, but the camouflage circuit is broken so it looks like a Police Box from the '60s
nite flutterz
Yeah, it's fine
Sound is good
Random cheering/clapping XD
feelsbadman.jpg flutterz also how do you guys do the bold name followed by the :
night
lol
lolol at superbrony64 and yes it is good dari
sound is fine
Dr.Who doesn't take itself to seriously.
its all just good fun
Ponies; apply directly to the head. Ponies; apply directly to the head. Ponies; apply directly to the head.
except with the angels
well it can get nightmare fuel, yeah
I could use DCD's EPIC OCD QUALITY
DON'T BLINK.
Method.
Those darn Weeping Angelks
Angels*
knockin about
lol Dari
Oh sweet Celestia those angels
Which would probably make it look epic.
The Silence creeped me out to
I do enjoy perfection every now and then myself...
HOLY SHIT!
Fun fact: these things freak me out for some reason.
The autons?
Brb switching on icechat
Yes.
I never look at a shope mannequins the same way.
oh wow, these things were way back here?
shop*
seeing we are at bronystate.net how long have you fine people been bronie?
D:
june
nice
dari needs desktop ponies playing at the same time
I haven't looked at shop mannequins the same way for a long time
may
only a month now
sadly
Docteh
The very beginning of July.
and theres the doctor
Since May
that is the new doctor?
since may
to bad he only had one season
Hmmm... I've been a brony since... I want to say April? Can't quite remember
i became a brony a the wednesday before S2 came out, sad thing is it feels like its been over a month
but then we got tennant so...i don't know
Wait, did this show have the angel statues that would attack when you weren't looking at them?
yes, its this show
SuperBrony64: Yeah.
when did sonic rainboom air
no Matt smith is the new doctor
got your arm
Good to know!
Who's Matt Smith?
Derpy is awesome.
Don't be hatin'.
but thats like, 4 seasons from now
the new doctor
he is fail
:P
he's the current doctor
/me takes arm back from Sumica
I like matt smith actually
Matt Smith is actually really good
heh sonic rainboom coupled with guiles theme is what convinced me to watch ep 1/2 *squee*
Matt Smith is awesome.
matt smith is awesome
Herdmind
Who is Matt Smith?
I HATE MAtt Smith.
He can't act.
The 11th doctor
He's shit.
Dont let dari see you say that
Lol
and hes also applejacks favorite doctor
What?! That's Dr. Who?
Nice to meet you rose, run for your life!
thats "The Doctor"
I won't lie, apart from Tennant and this episode I've barely seen any Dr. Who, so... :P
he's not "doctor who"
Doctor who is the name of the series
I want to see #10
Matt Smith is fuck ugly, can't act, the way his Doctor dresses is shit too.
I really like Eccleston and Tennant.
When I first saw Matt Smith, I hated him. But he's grown on me
He hasn't got anything going for him. >_>
I liked Tennant
i think that he is not bad but he is far from the best dorctor
What happened to the cool looking guy that said "Allons-Y" in an awesome way?!
although Matt Smith looks ugly as fuck
hey bowties fez's and stetsons are cool
SuperBrony64: That's Tennant
you're entitled to your opinion, sure. but I don't mind Smith
welp, i need "some" sleep before i get up in 4 hours to watch Ep 2 night all, ill probably see you guys still here come daybreak ^^
Tennant is best doctor
That's 10.
Tennant is BEST DOCTOR
and boom
Tennant is awesome.
Tennant was so cool
David Teninch
Tennant is tied with Baker for best doctor ever
David Tennant is my favourite :3
I AGREE DARI!
Then…why aren't we watching that?
because this is episode 1
Baker kicks the crap out of Tennant. :P
she kept the arm?
of new who
Which doc is Tennant?
10
the next one after this doctor
Lag, so much lag
NICE
but thats like 10 episodes from now
crap
this guys good, don't worry
Lol what is a "pub"?
*troll face*
LOL
XD
Anyone who asks that.
i felt bad for mickey, rose treated him like shit
Gets a newspaper to the face.
:P
foreshadowing!@
i feel bad for rory
hey dari, what's a flapjack?
What are they called outside of Britain? :P
Is that a public place or something?!
rory is actually pretty bamf
Like a park!?
is anyone else laging or is it just me?
River Song is my favourite character other than the Doctor.
did you see a good man goes to war?
Rory is the BEST companion.
im not lag
he died so many times but he did punch hitler
ing
She was good in Let's Kill Hitler
River Song is much better than Matt Smith's Doctor IMO.
Hi all
SO much better.
River is so cool!!!!
I only watch her her.
for*
Hey Xtaino
I figure next season or 2 we'll get the timelords back as a whole
oh hell is this gonna go all groundhog day?
river is cool because she was on ER
I... don't really care for River actually.
LOL SUMICA
then we can have the rani and maybe get to see this "corsair" timelord
hi
from the doctors wife
This show is so MLG
scared me for a second.
River Song flies the Tardis better than Matt Smith's Doctor.
GASP
She is fucking awesome.
What happened
Ah
she flies it better then most
What's that blue thing?
after all the doctor leaves the parking break on
the sonic screwdriver
LOL JACKIE
its his magic wand, basically
Sonic Screwdrivcer
Making a move on the Doctor.
XD
haha
Doctor: "EEEEEEEEEEEEEENOPE" *Trollface*
no lol
Haha
sonic screwdriver does not work on wood
^
moms a slut
He is such a fast reader
I heard something that the "Doctor" doesn't like Pears…
lol
First time he sees himself heh
tennant doesn't
and apples
Thats Ten
Tennant's Doctor doesn't./
every regeneration he changes a little bit
apples rubbish
11 hates apples
Suddenly plastic arm
yet he was eating one in the newest episode
FACEHUGGER ARM
11's a hypocrite
PEARS
I know right? Odd.
lol
Why can't it be pears
Dat pun
And now we gotta wait a couple of hours :(
but he does love fish fingers and custard
So, time travel was the cause of this problem?
If he eats beans in the next episode I'll expect a conspiracy.
4.5 hours...............
still too long :P
theres always weird monsters and aliens in the dr.who world
especially in london
dont care for this Dr so far.
THE doctor
Dat avoidance of title-drop.
Aliens HATE London in Dr. Who.
pretty simple to understand
London must be a fun place to live!
HES DECADE!!!!!!!!!

So, is he in the universe where audio is off sync from the video?
He speaks everything.

Not sure why audio would be off sync.
Must be VAC I suppose.
What's VAC?
XD
it's an audio spliter program
Neutrinos and whatnot
he just has to reverse the polarity or something
Poor Clive
Therefore, Aliens.
wubwubwubwubwubwubwubwub
that should fix the audio
Lol they're doing the robot

Pretty good, trying to get the hang of mIRC
INB4 mummy, are you?
any who, I was supposed to be sleeping like an hour ago.
This is...?
Dat cryptic question reversal.
It's really simple.
We need some 28 Weeks Later after this
inb4 Doctor Who
or more dr.who
Is there a way to tell who is idle on it?
Cjhange that to 28 Days Later and I'd agree.
lol Sumica is still awake after saying goodnight about an hour ago
indeed
can't resist the who
Either 28 X Later is good
Did't want you all to get bored then Dari went and put the Dr on.
If the name is greyed out they're idle.
:[
Nothing is grey on mine :/
was the lottery already?`
28 Weeks Later was horrible.
Sumica: Aww…isn't that cute? BUT IT'S WRONG!!
Inb4 Cap Jack
Zombies man
/me bricks SuperBrony64
How long is the audio out of sync by?
if you are going to watch a zombie movie. then atleast go with dawn of the dead (remake)
Oh my Gods, it's DROWNED *hit*
Are you on the site or do you have an IRC client?
was the lottery already?`
that too
1 second, less?
seems oki here Dari
Docter Who :D
a bit less than a second for me
i wouldn't mind watching one of the Q episodes of ST:TNG next. get ready for some more discord y'know?
its like half a second out of sync
I told you, mIRC
/me bleeds profusely.
my end is fine
YES Q WHO? please
Doctor Vs. Q who wins?
No one
the universe ends
EVERY ONE!
Encounter at farpoint station is first Q ep.
Aww, I was hoping for Tennant.
Q and Doctor would drink tea and laugh about the mortals
YES^
Something like that.
Oh, right, sorry. I don't use those. I thought you were talking about IRC in general.
They set aside their differences and be friends like MEN
Yeah, I dislike the new client on the site, so I thought I'd give it a go
That kid is a troll
Lawdee, that reminds me of WE WERE FIGHTING LIKE MEN bit. Is it?
I must say, This was the longest week in my whole life...
Why am i watching Dr.Who?
because its awesome
because the Doc rox
>_> probably
Were you on .net or .co.cc? I'm on .co.cc and it's still the same.
Yes. Yes it is
because its Dr Who.
eeeyup
.net
but the Regular Show is even more awesome
dr whoof *
Isha!
Still, was the lottery already?`
hambonin
I prefer Tennant, but I like this episode.
Lottery's been done, yeah.
Oh, so the tardis can take phone calls
what do you mean the Lotrery?
which movies?
when is the next stream?
it's taht pete and pete ep all over again.
Try Bronystate.co.cc It's still the same old client for me.
Priide:uhhh....now?
Oh! Oh! When'll episode 2 be streamed?
Again with the hyperlink...
2 o clock

I know how to embed mibbit onto the site in chrome anyway, but it's not perfect

Uhm... What time zone?
Longest week in my whole life this was...

ALL of the time zones
Alright, thankee.

I'd yell at a bomb.
FUCK YOU BOMB!
lol...
BUH-BOMB!
Oh my god bad CGI
good grip
thats part of the charm of dr.who
the bad cgi
Ezio level grip
This is made with Windows movie maker eh?
It's a tv show, what do you expect?
I now, it's just so retro
i know
Frank: The Windows XP version :P
:d
this is an interesting look.. first time for me using the new mibbit thingy
oh captain jack
Ass check?
apparently the broadcast is offline :/
HA!
zoom and enhance
Ass shot
priide: Make sure you are on www.bronystate.net
captain jack is a everyonesexual
TMI
hey everypony
Woe is me, for I cannot match my internet speed to watch the stream
Anything that moves
there is the problem
The 11th Doctor was the best!!
TheMaster it is called Pansexual
its the sky captain!
Priide: You internet cable was tangled wasn't it?
nice knowing you Frank , kick em Dari
the brits are a little less uptight about the whole sexuality thing
I agree with Frank. :P
:D
Frank and Aponymous can GTFO.
no i was on dinky page
Nooes D:
:/
10 is best
The 6.5 Doctor was teh betterest!
I still prefer the 10th Doctor.
What movie is this?
10th>4th
I'd rather see a plank of wood as the Doctor than Matt Smith.
But to each their own.
and then its a toss up with the others
true
land in the tams, I am sure it's safe
A plank of wood can act better.
10 is awesome too, I just prefer 11, he seems more, alien.
What ep is streaming
A plank of wood? That'd be bloody hilarious
the empty child
Mommy?
hey it's that portla 2 thing.
Are you my mummy?
Excursion funnels.
yeah that
fair point
lol
That's a great ep!
much better
Lawl, they all seem alien.
But all the Doctors are different.
That's the whole point.
True..
They all look like Ponies to me…is that normal?
thats why the 11th docter rules
Dayum! That chin is CHIZZLED!
I'd be fine with Matt Smith if he could at least act well.
True.
yes it is
I think Smith does fine
Mommy?
the writing for the eps is really good too
Vader
thanks to moffat
that kid is a Piro
What happens when the doctor is out of regens and the actor wants to retire?
Does Smith hate pears, though?
He is a terrible actor.
'mornin
That kid is a Pyro!
The delivery of his lines is so damn poor.
hello every pony
well for one the doctor has like 2 more regens left
Doesn't do them justice at all.
hello
hey everypony
lol..
and the master was cheating all sorts of regens even in the 70's so its not like they won't just find out a way to get him more regens
They just pissed themselves
Hi grand!
poor kids are gonna starve when this war ends.
No, I don't.
:P
true..
/me is shocked
:) mfw i saw dr who
Orly?
So, this takes place during WWII right?
Eeeyup
did someone blink?
Thank God the only way onwards is up after Matt Smith.

How did that one person use a particle beam to grab Rose?
COffee!

That Pyro is a Spy

Whether he gets another series or not is still being decided though.

THAT KID IS THE CREEPIEST FUCKING KID I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!!!
Mooooooooomyyyyyyyyyyy
No you're not
0_0
BUt u cant see his face?
the pyro is a lie
mwahaha
Everyone seems so scared all the time.
worse than weeping angels?
"just like a game, just like TF2"
I heard he signed on for 5, but then again, that WAS just some guy on Reddit though.
When he W+M1s just backpedal.
what film is this?
CUT OFF ITS HAND!!!!
open the door and Fire everywhere
It's Dr. Who, not a film
Kill it with Firee
OOOH
kaay
nuke it from orbit
prep the orbital friendship cannon NOW!
Omg that would be so awesome..
Okay, this is legitimately creepy.

Can't find any way to see if someone's idle >.<

Sumica: I just love quoting it.

tennant really shows off his acting for that
my other fav is Pandorica opens
demons run
shakespear
wait.. whut?
I don't remember any particular Matt Smith episode I liked.

angledpiggies
0:50, Jack harkness
blue waffle
have you guys seen the spoiler from todays episode? I didn't
wait..
grand: No.
ehm..
(psst hey) Are they streaming episode 2 here?
"Hello, Stonehenge! Who takes the Pandorica, takes the universe! But, bad news, everyone,
What's so hot it's cool, and so cool it's hot?
hello everypony
the time? oh ha ha
You know, with all the Who/Pony crossovers, I'm surprised they haven't included Jack Harkness.
FIDDELSTICKS
Not yet stoferin
because he'd try and hook up with all the mane cast
yo
to varrying degrees of success
3hours and 39 mins
who will defeat Discord? Derpy Hooves or Doctor Whooves?
lol
EXACTLY! Comedy gold!
also what would his cutie mark be?
YUSSSSSSS thx bro!
but yes they will be :)
No clue...
lips
A silver tongue
Should have used Bary White
none of them, CMC will defeat Discord
lol
i cant wait to hear discords smexy voice again ;)
he'd also probably make a pass at big mac
Isnt docter who in MLP too btw?
Doctor Whooves
Rarity x Jack
and have their cutie marks?
its just a fan thing
Q = greatest villan evar
its not unusual to get a boner at the movies
# 10 is
yeah :) And tah voice :D
Yeah.
unless they can get tennant to do va for dr.whooves
10 is in MLP.
Dat Voice!
its not unusual if it was toy story 3
He hits on Rarity, Spike gets pissed, he hits on Spike.
how Discord defeating cutie mark would look like?
lol
You should listen to DeLancie read the raven on youtube. To die for
i don't think even capt.jack would hit on a little kid
Spike Harkness
he'd go for big mac though in a heartbeat
The hair is clearly styled to look like Tennant and he happens to have time as his cutie mark.
ANYTHING that moves
lmao
i know rite, SO AWESOME!!
I think it's meant to be Tennant. :P
^^ agreed
Second
hey everypony...I can't stay up much longer..so I'm giving up..laters
But he wears a bow tie, right?
Victory
And when Applejack sold him some apples he said a Dr.who Line
Negative
thats a different pony with a hourglass
4 more hours
Matt Smith wears a bowtie
Night applebloom
Eugh.
he probably regenerated
i cant make it
night
There's like 3 Doctor Whooves, one of them did have a bow tie.
Bowties weren't cool before Matt Smith, now nothing can be less cool.
One had wings and an annoying vioce
lol
leroy wingkins
i srsly cant wait :3
Why'd you want to associated with the fugly, talentless, weirdo?
Rasc that wasnt whoves
then what about their talents in singing, acrobatics and housekeeping
maybe it was just a random time pony
Certainly looked like him
or how can you call what Applebloom does
A random mTime Lord who survived the war?
he was leeroy wingkins
LETS DO THIS
well its the pony universe, full of sugar and happyness
It looked like him but was not it was Leeroy Wingkins
and discord now
i don't know you just asked what a cutie mark for defeating discord would look like lol
apparently
Oh please no.
then who is leeroy wingkins
/sigh
Oh crap.
Leeroy Wingkins is... Well, Leeroy Wingkins
Why didn't any other time lords survive
there was a war
Boom.
Rarity is oprah
doctor killed them all because they were crazy
Time Lock
http://img863.imageshack.us/img863/1259/130062674868.jpg
Whuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut?!
hes the pegasi that yells lets do this in rainboom
LEEEEEEEEERRRRROOOOOOYYYYYYYY! WIIIIIGGGGGKINNNNSSS!
EX-TER-MI-NATE
omg why did i clicked that ..
Yeah, Dr. Whooves!Pegasus is the first one that Rainbow steals a number from
because pony_7885 said CMC will defeat Discord and I thought they could have their cutie marks that way
Is there an ep that deals with the disappearing time lord race
its a movie
in the 90's. 8th doctor
no thats leeroy wingkins
the time war
<-- confused
so at the moment the doctor is the last of the time lords
I tried watching that movie once, but Daily Motion hates me.
yo
maybe they will defeat Discord but won't achieve their CM that way
maybe
with great power
probably
Wingkins is the one who says "LET'S DOO THIS!" before flying off, Rainbow doesn't steal his number
is this the place to be for s2 streaming?
Dash stole his number.
he is #7
just a trollface will appear for a moment
I still don't get why he doesn't travel back in time (Or forward?) and try to stop his race from being exterminated.
But in one ep doctor walked in a whole room of time lords
Victor Meldrew
with words U MAD?
time locked. and he wouldn't want to prevent them from being time locked because he did it
Oh.
PegaDoc was #2
i was gonna say bitches
Yeah
I'm going to sleep till 6 AM. :P See you then everypony!
they were going to end the universe
Rarity is pony oprah
hi
...
He could always fix the time lock with pinkie pie
Pinkie Pie is Genius..
favorite discorded pony?
@Fuzzgotbeats yes, this is the place
they may have fixed the time lock when the universe reset during season 2 of 11
NONE!
applejack
Flutterbitch
soo guys, the ep is streaming at 6, but which time zone?
yeyuh
:O
or something, crazy stuff is always happening in dr.who
PegaDoc was #5, wasn't he?
9am EST
you can't really predict it beyond one episode or another
Well, originally.
k thx
meanieshy not flutterbitch
Howdy,can i ask you somthing? will there be an ep 2 livestream today?
I prefer Flutterbitch.
he was 5 first then Dash swapped numbers
dash was 2
meanieshy rolls off the tounge better
Dash was awesome
somepony know how the bets are going around?
Please show discorded octavia
I mean, about who's gonna defeat discord
meanieshy is interesting, but alibijack has the best face by far
http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/photos/images/original/000/175/310/Applejack%20Lying_000001.png?1316328436
Octavia doesn't have a personality, therefor she cannot be Discorded.
I really want Derpy to save the day in EP2.
somepony knows*
My hope is that instead of turning discord back into stone the elements of harmony will transform him into a regular pony with the same temprament
YES^
If Discord reverses their elements... Does that make Twilight's element Battler? *hit*
she would so lose at poker
replace derpy with luna kammerjunk and i'll agree with you
that could be nice fuzz!
She just plays out of tune
Luna would do great too.
recurring character who isnt god but just messes with everyone
Oh God...
MUUUUUUUUUMMMEEEEEEEEEEE
Oh shit.
I believe discorded Luna was Nightmare
MOMME
can i get a quikc timecheck on the episode? does it start in 3 and a half hours?
I think discord is too good bad guy to be defeated today
AAAGHHH! KILL IT KILL IT KILL IT!
woah woah woah. if Discord reverses their elements, and Twilight's element is Magic... and what's the opposite of magic? does that mean she'll have to defeat him with SCIENCE??
D:
DERP
time for some nightmares
sleep
yep
if i bothered to sleep
Oh it's K, didn't want to sleep any way
nightnight everypony
Doctor Twisano!
Twilight does science too
Mummy??
This didn't scare the manure out me the first time I saw it at all.
Night Grand
and now we know where pyros comes from
... Welp, it's a good thing I wasn't planning on getting any sleep tonight anyways!
LOL
name was gonna be grand galloping gala
yeah, defeated into a single episode is not cool
At the galaaaaa
heh, spock
Mr Spock?
it would be cool if he managed to escape and return after some time
Spock.
Spock lol
Lol
TITLE DROP

It's funny when people say Dr. Who?
Dr.Spock?

Im really glad that worked. lol
"Those would've been terrible last words!" Pfft XD
Those would have been GREAT last words, liar.
so which of the mane cast would make the best companion for the doctor?
"Don't forget to brush your teethe before you go to bed."
I will now never let anyone with a gas mask touch me XD

Alternate Universe Reed Richards is awesome
Well I had about 4 hours of rest this morning.
muuuuuuuuuumyyyyyyyyy
I trust the Pinkie chat will fill up.
oooh
i haven't slept at all
over the rainbow
Dat Musik
I haven't slept at all.
i was going to, but then this started playing
me neither
6 hours
Sooomewheeeere, over the rainboooow
3 days
Why am I staying up to watch a childrens cartoon when I have things I have to do tomorrow? Knowing that watching this means I will get no sleep?
waaay uuup hiiigh
I was going to sleep, but I didn't shower last night. ._.
et cetera.
DAMN YOU PONIES! YOU'VE RUINED ME!
Becuase ur a Brony
It's Discord's fault
Confound these ponies! They keep me awake at night!
Everyone is a brony here
Confound them. Insomnia, et cetera.
JS
Also, Richards isn't a brony
We are all Friends here..
That is why I have a death grudge on him
havent slept in 3 days but thats not because of mlp
i blame Q
AU!Richards is
Well then they're closet bronies.
Q is awesome.
Alternate Universe Richards might be bronies
I told my mom I was a brony today.
I'm surprised she didn't know.
and she said
you came out of the stable?
I used to be a closet brony
She always walks in when I'm wtaching MLP.
lololol
Reed Richards Head of SHIELD!
which channel is the episode gonna stream on?
I'm surprised that my roommate isn't still awake. Derpy, Donut Bar Chef?
Wasn't exactly in the stable. Everyone else in my family knew.
Sue and Johnny are definitely Season 1 bronies and pegasister
My bro in real life is a brony, making him a double brony. :3
Both my parents know about it - I've watched around... 10 episodes with both of them, I think
THE DOCTOR DANCES
rose, the doctor is trying to save your life
Show me ur Movess
THAT'S THE NAME OF THIS EPISODE
i know that feel shawn
what hours are in your locations? It's 11:55 where I am
THE DOCTOR DANCES.
I worry about him sometimes. he spends all of his time locked in his room, on pony chan, 24/7, if he isn't at work.
THATS NOT DANCING
brony state has multiple stream channels, no?
ah, a fellow Englander?
+1 hour for me
yes
Uhh... Title drop?
Oh right.
but #bronistate is the best
He's a great dancer
Just assume that it will stream in the main theatre.
Poland here
3 hours till the new episode
STREAM, COME ON
Best dance ever
Also, my mom said that she doesn't care if I like it or not. :3
So any of the www.bronystate/theatre rooms.
ok
British Columbia
My mom's awesome.
i've a friend from poland
who totally doesn't watch ponehs
2:55 am
She even offered to buy me some MLP shit.
of course, i had to go to another stream last week cuz brony state didnt work for me at first
Then my brother got jealous. :3
Lucky u
i guess?
my dad is woried about my brony state but I dont care.
not many people in Poland watch ponies
I always have a few streams at my disposal incase any of them get lag
Oh, the effects.
My dad called me gay at first. :P
*brohoof*
I want MLP FIM Merchandise here in Germany
my mom noticed when i was working on a pony ytpmv
but actually it's not that hard to find them
lol
on the Internet I mean
My dad still calls me gay...
lmaio
there is a polish brony podcast
*lmao
i just uptold my mom
It was hilarious actually, my mom noticed an episode on TV after I told her about it
Who managed to recruit new Bronies?
My dad noticed when I was playing a MLP song and my brother's girlfriend was singing along.
i like this show
and i was all
Eastern Europe and ponies.
cool
Playing on guitar*
so she went and recorded it, one night I was feeling pretty depressed
you mean Radio Dash?
Yeah, it was fun.
she*
i think so
Iv recruited 3 so far
Confound the proverbial slavic stone heart.
My dad and I just have lulz still.
I got recruited by 1
I was busy moping in my room, suddenly hear "MY LITTLE PONY, MY LITTLE PONY~" from the living room
Whenever my parents walk in, they stare at my screen for a few seconds, then resume conversation awkwardly while taking stolen glances at my screen.
When i left school i made the Whole school Bronies
It's hilarious.
LOL
It's funniest when brushing one of the brushable ponies while someone talks to you.
Porn would be less awkward Kammerjunk?
Like Goldfinger?
I haven't watched Dr Who in ages :|
I'm actually not sure.
ah, the nostalgia...
inb4 it's not her son
Their face displays the *WTF* well.
>MFW I have ot use uni wifi to watch this
because my off campus house has no wifi
> : C
parents walk in while watching porn. look them strait in the eye and have a casual conversation
cloud you've done this?
yea
WHY WONT IT COME ON???
Teach me your secrets.
MUMMY!
Mu-oah-mmy?!
MOMMMMMMMMMMMYYYYYYY
dont act like you have done anything wrong or wierd
MUUU--OAAHH MOOOOMMMMMMYY???!!!!!!!!!!!
and have a casual conversation
This is all the fault of the Evil that is
isn't it time?
So, yeah. My mother allowed me to order a MLP shirt. :3
ANCIENT EGYPT!
Because I'm underage.
maybe your folks are more open about it
what if youre naked xD
:(
"parents walk in while watching porn. look them straight in the eye and keep fapping until they leave"
also, i think the one brony line i haven't crossed is getting merch
humanity fuck yeah!
:applejack:
literally
I ordered two shirts the 5th. Still haven't got them D:
Fail
breeed like rabits
i know frank
The 51st century sounds AWESOME.
there is no Merch where I am
MUMMY
It's just like
oh dear
kinky
:O
only 2 percent of the
everyone busy growing gasmasks
http://ocularproof.spreadshirt.com/rainbow-dash-cutie-A8131728/customize/color/63 - Ordered that shirt today in black.
merch is worth getting
dead in the eye, cold as steel, Fluttershy level, death stare
And that's how Pyros are made
Did I do good, bronies?
That Pyro is a Soldier@!!
I jiust wanna know,but who thinks we watched the worst movie yet last night.
that is how you can make any one be casual about anything
i prefer to think Capt. Jack is the God Emperor of Mankind
Capt. Jack is more than that.
*just*
Yes you did Shawn
Yay.
when is the stream supposed to start?
/me pats AgentShawn's head
I feel like spoiling this show.
/me PURRS IN DELIGHT.
do it
Somebody should describe their Foster's Facade in TF2 with "MOMMY?" now.
bronystate.net
don't do it
it's on
doctor who is weird
i mean
sonic screwdriver
why is alot less people here for episode 2? i mean i understand why somewhat.. but is there any other reasons?
Wait, have they met the face of boe yet?
I don't know, CloudRunner. I kinda like it when they act all awkward.
yeah but its fun
Question. There any way to get chat to be side by side with video?
boom
SECRET BUT FUN
lol kammerjunk
Are you my mummy?
SECRET BUTT FUN
LOL
ENTIRE TEAM
IS PYRO
Dr.Who doesn't tend to take itself overly serious.
MeteorVenture might be because the stream kept being bad
indeed; once i ran bronystate on Opera the chat was side by side
Pyro Spam
Pyro rage
But on chrome it's below the video.
Spider_Jerusalem: Ctrl + Mousewheel down
so they might just wait for downloads, i know a few people who are doing that
It'S a legitimate Strategy
W+M1
rather then be like star trek and try and justify everything its more like star wars
no spies can ever get through that team
for more enjoyment.
alright thanks mantis
Oh.
it's got a setting for reparing barbed wire.
There we go.
Thanks.
Quick! We need two Heavy+Medic teams!
wait, i thought only the Doctor could use the sonic screwdriver?
it responds to whatever you're thinking
She knows how to use reason better than Twilight Sparkle.
entire enemy team counter pics engineers
Nomikos: Nope
So hey.
no, its just connected to your head
Engineers! Of course!
Anyone else think the eleventh doctor run is moronic and dumbed down?
the doctor has limited psychic abilities and he's use to it.
SCOUT SPAM
THE ELEVENTH DOCTOR
Spider_Jerusalem: Yes.
IS GAY.
I hate the 11th Doctor.
So, that last ep.
I STOPPED WATCHING DOCTOR WHO BECAUSE OF HIM.
sure is a lot of 11th hate
11th DOCTER RULES
MY CAPS LOCK SHOW UTTER DISREGARD FOR THIS
so much rage
What's the Doctor's greatest fear?
I GOT ABOUT TWO EPISODES INTO WHEN THE ELEVENTH DOCTOR CAME.
MUMMY
HE IS SO BAD.
my stare can do anything. I made my dad think I was litteraly going to rip him to pieces. and I was accross a room
Could it be all the horrific things he's had to do?
NO U
U MAD SHAWN
I MAD
They didn't show his fear.
I VURRY MAD
Spider_Jerusalem: To be honest I'm glad they didn't show his 'greatest fear', because whatever it is, it will be disappointing.
Y U MAD THO
i like the impossible astronaut and the day of the moon
It's more interesting to leave it as an idea.
OH NO
When is the stream gonna start?!
They showed his fear
Not when I watched it...?
i'm sure the doctor is mostly just afraid of being alone
When he went into the room that had young amy disappointedly staring out a window at the sky
LALALALALA
I CAN'T HEAR YOU
LALALALALA
That was her fear?
Not his?
Out of all the fething things that they could have picked.
It was his fear.
IN THE WORDS OF THE DOCTOR: "SPOILERS!"
Disappointing Amy.
Fucking retarded.
they do call him "the lonely god"
SPOILERS!

I need to remember that protocol.
Oh shit its RainbowDash1!
Like a boss.
pony_993: Yeah, we'll setream S2 E2 live
honestly i expected Discord to have to brute-force Pinkie, not Fluttershy, just cause Pinkie has those 4th wall powers. but it works this way too
allons-y
so is there a stream?
VODCA
FShy can outtroll the troll
pinkie is very sensitive about her friends
lol
and insecure
that can outtroll Celestia
same
ergo
Ewh/..
Fluttershy is best troll
Ponis are powerful things.
Good lord. Imagine what Pinkie could do, were she to decide that Equestria should fall.

I'm dragging a mate to watch it

You can break the stone, but they don't have anything to break them

DrDoom: Quantum locked assassins that can't move when being looked at, but are superfast otherwise
LOLOLOLOLOL

Cant wait
They killed a bunch of angels and they think they're going to go to heaven
Lol bow
Da fu
that just means you have twice as much time to get ready!
...quantum locked?
they are a race of aliens that can move really fast but turn to stone when viewed
get your body ready
and i found where button is located
A bow?
so they cant be killed
DrDoom: Look at them they freeze - look awway they don't
EVERYPONIES BODY READY?!?!
doctor who is running two hoes
What if you break the statue though?
You ill win
Only the statue breaks
Not the creature
also how fast are they if you break it
But the creature is the statue
DaFu

ninth doctor seems more violent than I expected
The Impossible Planet AKA Doom
DAT EPIC VOICE
Let me get the TV listing and read them all.
It was more like Doom than the Doom movie was
:D
It's pretty easy
He came right out of the Time War
now, I must watch Impossible planet
I'm tearing up
but my streaming guide has a section on it
a sec
so is there Europe and Asia?
He was a changed man, but Rose mellowed him
OKAY COUNTDOWN BEGINS..

Magically fueled sewing machines and stuff.

Not even funny.
If ADELAIDE has to die, why can't the Doctor save the others?
Now thats the part where were suposed to say "The Doctor" and they say "Who?" and we say "Exactly!"
I have loads of the old stories
Which is ironic for a comedy.

Damn you

You saved my life? Let me nag you for it.
And, downer ending incoming
DAT SCREWDRIVER!!

yeah
and then she kills herself......
I have a theory that the doctor is really some little alien parasite that inhabits human bodies.
wyatt, the thing was with rose, was that she created a paradox
fuckyourdoor
Annnd now he's just showing off.
yep
I hear so
Who the hell decided to wecome me the most depressing Dr. Who special ever made this early?
he just rewrote time

Fuck you doctor. Time will be maintained.
Doctor Who - 1, Time - 0

Lock and hinges are metal.

Sonic Screwdriver by Fuckyourdoor.inc
timelord victorious...

ALL POWERFUL
but it hell spiked for a few minutes
what is wrong with me
Is the broadcast going to come on soon?
NOOOOO
unabridged version
so if the doctor saved rose's dad would it be a paradox still?
they were mind controlled by Magneto
mom cake home to shoot her self.

Time always wins
Wait, she had a gun all long?
8 pm eh, british columbia was it?
but yeah

Yay! :3

CELESTIA KEEPS SPREADING LIES ABOUT HER BEING THE CREATOR
Canterlot exists in quantum flux
I know it is. It's an awesome snack. But it's healthy otherwise.
:S
I think of it as "shut up, westley"
I've seen a bit of transcript for the preview of part 2
I swear canterlot changes shape every 3 seconds
Luna episode is episode three I think but I'd squeel so hard if she shows up in the S2E2
yak!
FOREVERRRRRRR
Not sure if it's just me, but Celestia's eyes look a bit smaller
the stained glass discord sits in just messes with me, changes in every scene >.<

It's creepy for me too
See, I would say ponyville.
^^
"Back where you began"
:0
wtb votekick
nah, it's in 33 minutes
TGTF, I think you misspelled Fluttershy.
I still think that Celestia and Luna will team up with Twilight to wield the Elements.
The Discord shuffle
TEH MAZE
@Czymsim: Yeah. the laughter IS quite scary :(
the elements are still in that room arent they?
Somebody needs to stab discord
but suspense is lacking because of timing
Eugh. Spammers.
thanks, kinrah.
2,14 little does he realize next time will ban him
EQD hasn't updated and posted anything about streaming episode 2 yet so...
RD and FS: MY WINGS! :(
troll moment
Immediately made me think of the Cardiff running man
nop
title-dropping
Way to focus on only part of it.
good luck
:S
why do they have a huge labyrinth
Mine were "Holy crap I didn't kill myself after watching Babes in Toyland, I am a BOSS"
Twilight you SUCK AT RIDDLES!
and GTFO
Such is life in 22minute animation show land.
6_9
i'm pretty sure i said Pinkie pie
but discords still kinda creepy and brilliant and cool
I think they're back in the ruined castle in Everfree. Or made them invisible and they're still in the box.
Like a princess, I guesss :P
Twilight has not been knighted
Discord is best Q Continuum member.
whats up with everyone and luna...just wait
mazes behind places are bad ideas.
*yes you will*
ОКЕЙ
NO!
is the new ep gonna be streamed?
TOO MANY TITLE DROPS!!!
*guess
TS and Rarity: MY HORN!
"my little ponies" take a drink
because plot
We don't know that yet trebthegamer
6_9
Exactly. You misspelled Fluttershy.
Tadaaa!

thanks
rainbow has babies?
LETS PLAY A GAME

hahaha
Not yesterday or today.
NOT THE WINGS
Rick-click -> ignore -> ? -> Victory
HALF A FRIKKIN HOUR!!
i still wonder why celestia isnt giving them guidance about the tricks discord can do?
:|
2,14 no links please
@Fuzzgotbeats yes HIM is pretty scary, but always liked to watch him
SPONTANIOUS DE ACCELERATION!
she looks so weird without wings
aaaaaaaaah
wellhe'll probably include us on the stream list at LEAST
Personally, I'd have pre-emptively blown the labarynth down
Celestia just chillaxes while the mane 6 work so hard
Hey guys
no magik
Love scared Twilight.
good, they're not horny anymore
yeah
Shoulda drank red bull
inb4 elements are really at old castle in everfree
dat discord
They're no longer horny
/lamejoke
XD
Your Whorn
Celestia is trolling them all again
:[
lolol
pony_745 - it should have started by now, showing S2E1
MUHAHAHAHA
creepiness never detracts from enjoyment for me
My Whorn!
You should be seeing Part 1 right now.
should the fillies get arrested for homicide
it's a test
troll
No, Twilight. You are a Earth Pony.
Oh shush, fluttershy. You never used your wings anyway.
Priceless!
JS
rarity= nolonger horny
trololol discord
It's already on Pony_745
Oh Discord, you magnificent bastard.
Dat lack of sanity
should I be able to see something?
Seth normally posts us, we emailed, but the other staff didn't. >_>
back where you began or silentspall's idea
discord y u so troll
but dischord id o.0
Sorry
Anyone hoping for a new song this episode?
And then, Twilight was an Earth Pony.
no cheating
dat meme
*is
dose Whornes
also speaking of creepy >"GOOOOD LUCK, EVERYPONY!"
i'm totaly eating popcorn now :3
wut wut WUT
still love how he pokes AJ on the "no wings=no cheating"
the game
Twilight x Discord, proof was just shown.
i see you firefly!
I dont, belfast...
says no magic, uses magic
he should take Aj's hat too
oh right, saorry i just didnt click play, ok then
the first rule of the game is you lost the game >.<
I lost
She said she's the only one that can unlock the door to the elements. When have they ever lied on this show?
dash looks so weird without her wings.
Notice He uses both flight and Magic.. lols
man so hyped
Im tired of all the random music playing -_-
it's not magic
no flying and no magic. discord uses both. EPIC TROLLING
GOOD LUCK EVERYPONU
I've seen the spoilers of the second part, Discord is one of the most charismatic bastards ever.
Twilight and Rarity look better without whorns, I think
Nope
who heres HYPED
i lost
it's chaos
no pony magic
he so crazy.
yeah they derped pretty hardcore
he's trolling, thats it
*EVERYPONY
How come there isn't a post on EQD with stream info?
when i was a little filly and the sun was going doooooooooown
Holey cow, 400+
I lost
u mad discord?
He's a villain, plus he's chaotic. He's allowed to cheat
AJ's hat should have gone and pinkie's hair should have deflated
Pinkie Pie can still break the 4th wall
nope,avi, I won the game years ago
Yup
together!
wish i didn't have to go to school right after the new episode
/me is hyped?
Now the Borg show up and equestria falls into further chaos
Oh that's horse shit
nope.avi
WHEN DOES IT COME ON?!?!?!?
fail.
twist!
He's a more trolling riddler
discord lost at start
does anyone else thinks that Discord an Celestia are a divorced couple?
can't believe theres more than a weeks gap between this episode and the next
"TOGETHER!"
it's the same thing Pinkie's using
LEEEEROY JENKINSSSS
nonono, it's magiq
Tovler: Dang it.
"NOPE!"
Olol
9 am
Or not, apparently
lol
eeeyu- nope
That bad, eh?
w/e he's still a bitch
lol
Magiq with a Q
and then TOTAL ORDER
31 minutes
together ..... nope
Discord didn't take Dash'
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
Oh god, im having a stress attack, will this stream the new ep or not? D:
my bet is that their elements are in each pony's place of origin. pinkie = rock farm, dash = cloudsdale, applejack = apple farm, twilight = canterlot, rarity = ?, fluttershy = ?
approx
Just go though the fucking bushes
note pinkie and fluttershy's parts join up
i never expected that XD
Horrible
he's awesome
school on a saturday?
:[
LO PINKIE HAD NO WAY OUT!
fluttershy is already on the ground
and that's why Celestia hates him so much
discord tried to get half of her shit
Flutterbitch is best pony.
No eqd post cause Seth left town
Just quick poll: who else saw the wall thing coming the first time they watched this?
poor fluttershy :(
Absolutely horrible.
can we get an encore of babes in toyland after ep2?
CHATROOM NUKE O____________O
Lolol
good villian
aw boohoo hoo
's wings, this is the background Dash from Fall Weather Friends.
IT'S A TRAP!!
Azardea; Yeah, new ep will be streamed
hehehehehehe
ME!
Be afraid
KAH BEWM
WOOOOOOO!!!!
nah my bet is that they're "back where they started" ie still in the case, just invisible
yeah I noticed that kinrah
Flutterbitch is awesome
but he corrupted fluttershy
actually, it's magiQ
Worst movie we ever watched here.
Here goes the Macbeth shenanigans.
2-second nazi symbol on the left from the first top-down view
lol anyone else noticed that pinking was in a box?
so fuck him
yeah i have a class at 10:00 AM
Does anyone else notice that fluttershy's maze connected to pinkies?
Apple used rollout
ap-PULLS

let's follow dem totally not suspicious apples
are there hidden adds here?
Go apples! GOO!
that sucks
I assure you Reefer Madness won't be nearly that bad
It's weird
what does mean tarnation?
watch out for falling apples! they're fatal...
BE FREE!!!
I thought it'd be where they first used the elements
I suspect discord would close them up as they spot each other
We're about to get a lot more bronies!
Apple Elemental
I didn't see it coming
:P
Only 500 or so people this week?
adds? where?
XD
ДИСКОРД НЯШКА\
Or, "back where they started" as....where their friendship started?
Am I the only one who made the connection that discord + the alter ego'd mane 6 are the seven deadly sins?
newton

I only barely survived
6_9

I'm not a pony. I am a man. AN ANCHORMAN!
The apples talk to her all the time.
seriusly AJ i tought u were smarter than this
WITH THE RIGHT LINK TOO
except Fluttershy
background music is great here
O~O
Finally
the apples are a lie
she took a peek
Are they doing a Zecora imitation?
Don't trust this place > believe what the apples say.
well
GUIZE! How long do I have until the new ep streams?
Spiders Web was at least LAUGHABLY bad, Babes in Toyland on the other hand...
She's been drinking too many Applejacks and Appletinis
LIES LIES LIES!!!

APPLE JACK SAYS NOTHING!

Fluttershy did follow the butterflies
:O
discords laugh
i'd be like, screw that, i'm not that curious
Pay no attention to floating island with castle.
Twilight had her horn in that scenem but Rarity, Rainbow, and Fluttershy were still earth ponies...
its like a bawss
Probably will today
Book of Proverbs: King solomon says : "Him that soweth discord among his brethren."
People actually being in #Applejack

Discord is secretly Zecora's father. Where do you think she gets her rhyming skills from?
i never thought i would see such a cool villian like Discord in a show about ponies
She's not even lying right now...
"Applejack wouldn't lie..."
technically is true
if discord hated her
Ah
WE ALL FLOAT DOWN HERE

The opposite of laughter is being touchy.

Also, why would she want such a big diamond? After all, they are extremely hard to cut, and it would be so heavy that she couldn't use it. So unless she put it in her shop for decoration, then it's kind of useless
Rainbow dash = traitor ;p

YES DERPY

lol, i was wandering were the lag was xD
I don't think this is cheating. Unfair, yes, but not cheating.
if it was live it would have a lot of commercials I think
bets on proper derpy-eyes derpy in part 2?
She goes to save Cloudsdale, her friends would be totally fine with that
@pinkamina ran smoothly for me
You need a Mann Co. Key to open box

Besides Rarity, Rainbow Dash gave in the easiest, that surprised me at first.
hope so
the sad face emoticon should use lyra. :'(

I mean, I myself am not of any use to anyone, but you still want to have me, right?
Isn't derpy gonna be ditzy doo or something

Applejack is so bad at lying, she tells the truth when she's lying.
trixie is best pony.
2 hours of sleep
I read that after you typed it mr11brick, ergo YOU lost it.
I hope Luna returns :O
I pardon that your Friendship has been deleted by Hasbro Inc
True, a master of the mind can break anyone, except fluttershy
Why is his umbrella a cat?
MEOW
