08,1since I missed the stream

04YOU HAVE NO IDEA

08,1>>;
Plus, she's practically indestructible. LOL
Finally someone

waifu is a wapanese term for a female character one likes A LOT
Is the sound/audio lagging slightly at times for anyone else?
04Seriously
04Don't
04Be glad you weren't here
he always has a sore throat
08,1errrmm.... okay.....?
only problem I really have for this vid is that RD's voice isn't that good.
140 minutes? I never saw that version
It's kind of a joke
until now
I always thought "waifu" was a way of saying "my wife".
WEHPIE
04It's a goddamn travesty that film was 140 minutes long
that was longer than 140 minutes
Silly Japan
Mahpie or w/e picked it
he was more sympathetic
04Mahpie?
ya me too
04Is that the name we have?
it is, but the wapanese are amusing
I did!
I thought I was the only one
i liked the minicrons
04Mahpie is on my permanent kill list
6Lol,hey :P
6How you doin'?
Lol
Great
"this guy"
working on a blog
6:O
lol
Seems Legit.
paper thin detective plot spread over 140 minutes
disregard females; acquire ponies
04But Fluttershy....
2http://dragonnewsnetwork.blogspot.com/
he's no viewer
08,1hmmm
04You don't understand
lag*
04It was bad
08,1love and tolerate
he did that to us on PURPOSE
08,1:<
6:3
commercial incoming
fluttershy, you just don't understand
also, >mfw this is fluttershy's modeling music
Ze Magiks
04And that ......THING
04No
/me disapproves of not loving and tolerating >_>
that movie
This is epic.
They should have gotten DRSMOOV to do Starscream.
2I'm not taking over the world with spyro and or ponies
Taste the rainbow MOTHERF****ER!
TAG, YOU'RE IT
2 hits on RD.
cannot. stop. laughing

Awful

This... Is epic beyond belief.

04Mehpie
Tornainbow!
04Easily
6No world domination? :3
lol this is my favorite part
his wing rips off
04At least I *laughed* at Spider's Web
Wing Damaged!
DENIED
where did they get the voices?
what's spider's web?
04I legitimately laughed at Spider's Web
2Maybe
he is 16.6% less cool that Rainbow Dash
EVERYTHING
boob missiles!
BOOOOM!
2Anyways you should join
that said, it was still awesome
It was horrible, I can't decide if it was worse than Babes though.
and they even used the music for it
:0
Miracle Dogs Too
08,1we're going to have to watch 'Little Shop of Horrors' sometime ;3

Hey
Starscream is now inside Rainbow Dash...
She ate Starscream?
2,14 well hello
STARSCREAM YOU HAVE FAILED ME FOR THE LAST TIME
That was beautiful.
lolwut

this is the most awesome thing ever
Mild indigestion. LOL

2Uxie said wait before making a website
>Transformers fans face when
Was there ever any doubt that Rainbow would win?
08,1o-o
08,1what about me?
2which came into this
o.O
6:O
/me hugs Revolver back
not at all
Bayformers Starscream was killed by Shia LaBouf. That's WAY more embarrasing
I thought you werent here...?
but I thought they were going to make something of the loyalty factor, which is their biggest difference
fluttershy

Fluttershy happens to be my fave room
I just realized that

lol
Is it bad that i actually like this movie?
no
this has the potential to be awesome
lol

He can be my assistant ruler
/me salutes
screw frog
hey, can we still post .jpg images?
2Post maker like me we get into the news
Hes truly a man of few words
at least he's not doing the bedroom eyes
For the Eurostream, you should just show this for two hpurs instead of Babes in Toylasnd.
or bathtub eyes
*salutes*
/me kneels
/me bows
oh boy
Polarfire! <3
wait my first one didnt appear
this isn't ponily relevant
hahaha
6Yeah
Not pony, but awesome.
he's studdying hard and such
Needs to be synched with ponies
Tension!
lol point
i dont think it has to be Pony Related
completly agreed
nice suit though
Rarity has both
2It's not "Your Hub for everything Spyro." for nothing
I would wear that suit to work.
She needs an accessory to go with every outfit.
6Lolz :P
ahh japanese angst
....lol
2Anyways you want a role?
6Sure :3
2ok let me list them off

Batussi!
RoboCop needs to come back

Plus. You've seen how her cat responds to her.
2The Code user or coder Does all the code for the blog and the Admins place it
/me should not have had that pizza. All those carbs are keeping him awake.
that is normal for cats
those classy suits
I had a pizza too
.
Yup. Unless their with fluttershy.
I exist on a diet of burgers and pizza
All backup dancer should wear tuxedos and top hats.
They only need a monicle to look even more classy
lol
ugh, that sound quality
lol osu
I'm going to open a strip club where all the women wear monocles.
X_0
lol
that's either sped up
lol
or someone is transhuman
Val you have faild me >_<
what's with the whistle
or it's a machine
nah the sound was made like that on purpose
is this osu!?
it clears up
hey....the gameplay reminds me of Elite Beat Agents
2And then the Mods
yup, it's on auto
thats cz it is
an open source version at least
It is augmentation.
I dont know... but now I want to
this looks macroed
cool
its running on auto
i think the free version is osu
This is definitely not a real person.
cuz its freaking impossible to do for real
theres a little icon under the score that say its running in auto
6Heh,I think I'll go with the mods :P
right under the percent
yfw we have dari again?
we've seen japanese do impossible gaming feats
oh XD

I guess I'm a regular
defein regular =p
Here *raises hand*
not too bad actually.
I'm a regular
Is this the intermission?
it finally cooled off some.
lawl this again
Or are we just waiting?
I'm here often, but I don't know if I'd be considered a "regular".
I come here rather often, but there's usually little to no action here when I come
becoming a regular...
also y u no in #lobby
2We do need members
I used to be kind of regular. . .
I think they're just gonna play random videos, and then maybe S2E1 again
Incredibles is more popcorny
before the stream starts
still fantastic though
Popcorn is more incredible!
they need a sequel to increadables
Invredibles was ok
one is coming
yeah, not... cars.
Untreadables
I'm still waiting for a priceless episode of ponies.
lol
and hopefully the stream won't choke and die like it did last time, when we had to go an emergency, low-quality last resort
in the wors alegedly
I didn't even see Cars 2, it looked terrible
works*
6I'll try getting some peoples off the forum :3
....I misspelled again..*facehoof*
liking the chearleaders
2ok
if yuore not a regular that it
yeah
Cars was ok. I don't understand the hate. I've not seen Cars 2.
*is
DIS PLOT
cars wasn't bad
2She'll kill me
it was just kinda meh
I really liked Cars 1 but Cars 2 was just... bad imo
it was fun though, we barely needed it cuz #bronystate was pretty sparse
I loved cars 1
6Ok :P
havnt deen cars 2
that was the one part of the movie that really felt pixarish
seen*
six-way?
where he stops at the finish line
Ive seen this!
I've driven through the actual town where Cars was based off of.
lawl this
lol
Cars was good, I still consider it the worst of Pixar's movies though
lol
i heard that was cuz there wasn't the usual EqD post about us this week
Lol. This'll be good.
6Brb,I want some toast :P
Ratatouille was the worst in my opinion
Win
ratatouille was okay
lmao
All this cars talk made me want to play Putt-Putt (and Pajama Sam)
lol

You would think he would be WATCHING.
hellbeapampalo
2ok
this is me right now, lol

Best apology ever.
it's more awkward than depressing.
