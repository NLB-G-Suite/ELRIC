Hiya Saturn
I know where a huge one still is, but quite hard to get there with all the overgrowth - pipe is at least 10' in dianmeter - as a kid with my brother and both our friends, we never went to far into that pipe - might head down there to find out if I can still get back there
how you doing Saturn

Saturn i must agree
Oh hey, Saturn! Glad to see you had fun :)
Saturn throughout the entire weekend
there was only one bit which i wouldnt describe as fantastic
and that bit was embarassing
Saturn got 3 people from here put em on a panel
and then streamed it
I saw that, I think
was it today?
:D and then the city came and put bars on several of the larger entrances
I missed that part. I was at church when it happened
how come you guys never responded to my textws
*texts*
You were here on irc then?
We didn't see any texts

Yeah, but nVidia and ATI are trying to make GPU run Ageia PhysX etc, to make it less CPU intensive and such
some day we might have phsyics cards, PPU as well as GPU
Mm, we'll have to wait and see though.

Ageia was a standalone physics card when it first came out, and the tech demos were crazyyy- then nVidia bought it and made it integrated into their cards
