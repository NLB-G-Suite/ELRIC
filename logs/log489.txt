Trust me it's not.
The_Pony_Guy: i thought i had misread your sentence

mario_pony: What did you think I said?
Which one was he again? Sorry, I'm not very well versed in the Doctor Who universe
Ponies47: IKR
Oh yeah, I recognize that one
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Have you ever been banned from here before?
The_Pony_Guy: just forget it
david is the 10th who wears glasses, a tie, and says "Allons-y!"
Yeah,don't ask why my nick has "Guy" in it and I have a boyfriend,okay? :)
dammit now i wanna know
Ponies47: sometimes, but its due to chat lag
Ponies47: nvm they were kicks
I see
HOORAY FOR WIKIPEDIA!
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Yeah everypony gets kicked from time to time. But being BANNED is not fun. I was banned for an hour and it felt like FOREEEEVER! :(
Like limbo?

Chuck Norris carries me around for protection
Hang on, can time lords change genders between regenerations?
Oh hey Kipkat07_USAF, you seem bothered
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: I tryed #Ponychat it was boring. You should of seen it when I got banned. Right after I posted the link to the fanfic everypony else started writing ban ban ban ban ban and then I was kicked. Tryed to get back on it said I was banned. :(
I was sad :(
Ponies47: i mean other places =/, for me its Teamliquid.com
Ponies47: you should of tried tumblr
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: I see. But I love this chatroom. But I'll never forget that day and I also learned to keep my trap shut about certain fanfic's.

My asshole uncle has decided its time to curb my "gaming addiction" and when I told my mom that the reason I go on is to talk to you guys she didnt believe me. I got a rope, made a note, and really was gonna do it. And she didnt believe I would do it. She knew I wouldnt. I shouldve. Just to prove to her that I would kill myself to protect my computer. You guys are really the only ones I tell my problems to and I c

mario_pony: Why?
I hope you kids learned somthing from my story. STAY OUTTA TROUBLE!
Im putting all my pony stuff on a flash drive to keep my secret. My assfuck uncle thinks hes gonna put passwords on all my files he can go eat shit and die for all I care.
Ponies47: IKR
The_Pony_Guy: you said to not ask why your nick had guy in it
The_Pony_Guy: so i assumed that you were not a guy
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Yeah don't mess with the mods they got POWER!
your uncle does sound like a pain in the arse
@_@ my brain hurts
Kipkat07_USAF: Why would he do that? It's your computer!
mario_pony: I didn't say you couldn't ask me why I have guy in my name.Read the rest of the comment -_-

Ponies47: I know... Hes a fucking dick.
Your uncle is invading your privacy

Polydunami: ^

I wish the Cubs would do better :(
Im bored, anyone want a random music video?
Polydunami: The Chicago cubs?
Yeah. They're doing pretty badly right now
Polydunami: They kicked the Brewers butts last night. Which makes me sad because I'm from Wisconsin. :(
Okay to make it clear to everypony it's Football NOT soccer
In some places, there is no difference
Polydunami: yeah.
/me flips tables
"The world needs more Bronies"-John de Lancie
The best quote ever
Ponies47, Cubs got beat right back today by the same Brewers
REAL football, problem solved.
Feijenoord. enough said.
/me "uuuuuuuuuuuu" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyAtc-MyvA8&feature=related
NO football even better solved
Polydunami: true. But lets not get into a baseball war here.
did somepony say WAR
VioletGreySha: aww, but I like football...
futbol
I like sports in general
awww but i hate football =3
O hey VioletGreySha :)
hay Ponies47
WallDives: language?
mario_pony: No :$
Spectrum_Rush: my team, or where I'm from?
Anyway, just stating a fact, Ponies47. I live nowhere near the midwest
I like sports enough for it to be my major...
Polydunami: I do. Wisconsin brony right here :)
WallDives: Feienoord?
Nederland.
I know that much
Germany here =3
It's 4:30 am in the east.
And before anypony asks NO we do not all grow dairy products here. :|
WallDives: Intresting
At least you have three teams to cheer for, Ponies47
Polydunami: true.
We only have Hockey
and Canadian football.
WallDives: danke
Well, we used to have basketball, but the Grizzlies moved to Memphis
Did you see the new hotdiggedydemon video?
eeeyup
which one?
imgur: a new Jappleack?
night everypony im done for the night
the sonic one?
night Shamroc.
night Shamroc
Goodnight Shamroc :)
Night Shamroc :)
You want this cake?
And I COULD cheer for the Canucks, but their season is over
dont remind me...
/me sighs
Just watch it.
imgur: why ot link it then
and then the chat died.
Well, it's not like the Canucks are gone forever
So don't feel too bad
just feels like forever.
ah well. Theres EURO for this month.
so...uh...yeah. Dat Fighting is magic.
When does that game come out?
I dunno what to say :S
dont know, but probably later than October.
I want it. It looks like fun.
I'll give it to you straightforward. It's an announcement that the HDD store is avalible in europe, there's a discount offer this weekend, and that he may come to your hometown.
Plus there's a code to get 15% off any T-shirts you buy
fight is magic deserves money if ya ask me
^
maybe, but if they dont want it, we cant give it to them.
so, keep spending money on merch, which will make sure that MLP stays on air.
yeah i guess but still
besides, if we paid for it, Hasbro would nuke them into the ground for copyright infringement.
and that would be bad.
I hope MLP will last atleast 5-6 seasons or more.
tbh? I dont.
I hope MLP will REMAIN GOOD for at least that long
My fear is that it will eventually start spiraling downward in quality as the years go by
Polydunami: yeah
like spongebob or family guy
Yeah like SPONGEBOB!
I hope it has 5-6 seasons TOTAL. I dont want the series to burn out, run out of aesops, or turn into something I dont want to see.
:|
the series is too precious, to pure for it to deserve that fate.
I hope it lasts long, but still remain good. Look what happened to Spongebob :S Back then it was good, but now it's crap
that being said, if they can maintain quality somehow, then please let it happen for a long time
Ponies47: I just said the same thing ya crazy cunt! huhuhuhuh
WallDives: yeah. I gotta argee. I would love to see a movie but as A SERIES FINALLY not while it's still on the air because after a TV show gets a movie and still runs it's never the same again
i consider the movie to spongebob the ending to spongebob, period
imgur: (Squee) YOU I CAN EAT ALL THESE APPLES *Noms on apples*
but it was a GREAT ending
technically, the Movie IS the end.
The movie still feels... distrubing :S
Reminds me of The Simpsons
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaG-JijAr-c&list=UUfBfjK2Gg777FLAWrAZ6Slg&index=1&feature=plcp
StupidSexyCJ: Yeah after the movie. The show has never benn the same :(
all the episodes, happen before the movie, iirc.
i think they burned themselves out on the movie or something
That movie happened a while ago, actually
Wow
What about Phineas and Ferb? There was a movie, and the show keeps going.
New Spongegbob sucks. Period :|
opinion...
not saying I like it, I dont watch it.
I don't really watch that show either
but if its really that bad? it wont be on the air. raitings and adverts and all that.
Spongebob neither
You know what's stupid? People were sueing Spongebob back then because it was "unappropriate". I don't hear much about that little disbute now for some reason
same no one hears about the Pokemon/Evolution arguements.
People get bored of making a big deal out of nothing
Usually
Did you miss last saturday's ponies and got Batman instead?
i'm going to sleep, Goodnight everyone
Ponies47: too many other shows for kids that can get worse to worry about now
Goodnight TheGreatAndPowerfulT :)
night TheGreatAndPowerfulT
night TheGreatAndPowerfulT.
Because you ignored the warnings.
hai guize wats goin on in ths chat?
ya um does anyone know if there is a demo i can play of my little pony friendship is fighting??
ninja_pony, you mean fighting is magic?
I don't think so
yes
my bad :)
not until Canterlot Gardens, thats the first open beta.
Night TheGreatAndPowerfulT
and you have to go there. otherwise, you wait until it releases.
StupidSexyCJ: eeyup
they MIGHT have a playable build at EVO, but it hasent been announced.
well at least they have a beta ready, I was starting to think it was just never gonna happen
walldives?? where can i sign up for the beta?
I hope Oklahoma City wins the finals. Long shot, but still
ninja_pony, there is no "beta". just a playable build. that you have to go there for, in person.
Where's that located?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmGt0EhVToE&NR=1&feature=endscreen <- I want this idea turned into a episode. But with the mane 6. :)
oooh ok yeah so there is a build lke demo i can get my hands on right now?
Canterlot Gardens is near Cleveland, and is in the last weekend of September.
ok thx :)
Ah I see
ninja_pony: no.
there is no playable build atm.
walldives :(
lol
I'm in Wisconsin. I'm to young to drive. If I could I would drive to the Canterlot Gardens
yeah kk thx for the info i mean :)
hell, theres only 3 characters close to completion, 2 incomplete, and one not started.
np.
wa away way we talkin bout
you.
WallDives: funny
I thought so.
I hope Trixie is playable character
walldives so i should be able to have a good in like september?
go
And now it's time for some smooth jazz
IT'S SO SMOOOOOOOOOOOOTH!
IT SO SMOOTH YOU CANT TAKE IT
you should be able to see it played? probably. you probably wont be able to play it until, if I had to guess, maybe November or December.
thats a guess mind. we know it wont be before October, if schedule holds.
I hope the next Two Best Friends that gets ponified is Resident Evil 4
*Slides across floor* SO SMOOTH!
ok thx yeah iv seen the live stream of it was awesome cant wait to play it :)
I've seen all the live streams, and I've discussed it quite a bit...
and my stick works on the computer, so I'm happy.
It seems my internet connection is being slightly finicky...
/me slaps Polydunami around a bit with a large trout
Discord...
Howling at the moon
well thx for the info walldives :)
Wait, that doesn't work at all
sure we'll go with that
np.
Interesting fact: Eurobeat Brony - Discord (The Living Tombstone's Remix) is coming to Rock Band 3 soon :o
Is listening to art of the dress :)

*Lays in bed next to Fluttershy*
I like his voice better, yes.
FS is still overrated...
Kawww shoo kawww shoo kawww shoo
minecraft on the highestsetting is not that stressfull to a pc:S
/me formulates plan to rescue Fluttershy form Ponies47
Indeed, WallDives.
StupidSexyCJ: I live with heresilly filly :)
I'm missing something here. FS?
Im probably not gonna be on in a long time and I need you to tell the other ponies what happened. Namely TheRainbowDash and CCCP and the mods
You know what this chat needs?...
* her silly
then again, I dislike spineless people/ponies, so...w/e.
Smooth jazz.
Polydunami, FS = Fluttershy.
but WallDives the funniest things happen in those five minutes
Oh
or, as I joke, Hanako "FlutterShy" Ikezawa.
Deploying smooth jazz in three... two... one... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1AK0jwHApQ&feature=relmfu
Oh god xD
you know its true.
But she has no burn scars... ?
you dont need the scars for the personality.
I know that much
http://i.imgur.com/GcnRT.jpg
o hai Ghosties
But yeah, to me, Fluttershy is overrated, but not too much
Dat Avengers.
Also, hey Ghosties :)
Hey Ghosties!
to me, they're all equal.
04Sup
Flutters in one the lowest on my list.
Oh hi, Ghosties.
Hey Kammerjunk!
Oh hi.
I used to like her the best... then I got to know Rarity a little better...
Seriously, why can't I stop watching Dr. Horrible?
o hai Alicorn_Prince_Shane
/me activates lurk mode
I've got the Tippi syndrome now...
I like how Rarity is getting more love every day. :3
Ninjazz: Every got damn time I open safari, and click Tabs... mmmmmmm

!POKEMON
Hey Shane. :)

Hey there Shane :3
XAX: Wait... What does that mean? :S
Ninjazz: Pinkie
Let that be enough of a hint
XAX: You mean that picture?... ;)
04You know what the best part of Bioshock 2 is? Setting traps around the area of a corpse that has ADAM.
fluttershy needs some personality development. aside the repressed psychotic thing, she is quite shallow
Well, the melodrama of Rarity is quite entertaining in my book
And waiting for some splicer come by...
/me random dance!
Ghosties: naw best part is throwing corpses at splicers to make more corpses with
derpy_pony, and when they develop her personality, let it stick, for god's sake.
/me random hug for Magical_pablez94
04Fluttershy shallow?
/me hugs Ninjazz back :D "hi "Meanwhile" :D:D"
04Wut?
Hi all i'm new here so i'm sorry if my question is pretty dumb but: is there only a stream on Friday?
Magical_pab|Music: ... I don't think her would like me being in his place. :$
Fluttershy Swallow?
Ninjazz: newbie you know what to do
Elondras: welcome! and no, most every day, movies on friday

Elondras: Ninjazz is an evil person, you should be scared.
((chat derped pls repeat))
Welcome Welcome Welcome, Elondras! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix7vrluEm4E
Elondras: In that case, welcome to the BronyState Mental Asylum! Please leave your sanity in the designated Sanity Disposal Bin and proceed into the next room for your strait jacket.
Elondras: dont listen to Om
Om: No you're the evil person. :|
doesn't seem so evil to mee
Polydunami: If you want to call it that. I will now refer to it as that saxy song from bleach, because bleach is awesome.
Ninjazz: Oh yeah...

Forgot.
Heh. >:3
WallDives: Hiya.
Magical_pab|Music: It's been good. Nothing bad happened. :)

Haven't anypony watched Dr. Horrible?
I am disappoint.
/me wished he could stream mega man x
Heard of it
You are horrible

Spectrum_Rush: I instantly spotted Wet Mane Rarity. :$
Never really interested me
Dr. Horrible, I mean
Ninjazz: of course you did;)
:$
sooo
Ninjazz: You could spot a wet Rarity in the dark, while blindfolded
I mean... Dash is cute... But come on... Rarity is way more... noticable... :$
anyone else excited for new Reel Big Fish album?
Om: Probably. :D
Bleach OST 4 - 07 Can't Lose
Probably by her smell or something stalkieresque like you are
like how certain somebody finds you.
for a song titled cant lose it certainly doesnt sound like you'd expect to me
=__=
=_(\ yes
I don't know how she smells like, dude...
But I wouldn't mind to find out. :3
wait what? who are we smelling?
My point exactly
/me sings "love is in bloom"
Ninjazz: Well, I instantly noticed the Braeburn one.

STOP CRASHING COLLOQUY
hey guys
you useless excuse for an app
Hey alexxm!
Hai alexxm
whats up alexxm
hey XAX what dpes colloquy do
alexxm: Colloquy is my IRC client I have on my iPod.
not much trollhunter just got up how about you
its a IRC client.
WallDives: And niny over there smiled
04I'm fine, trollhunter. Glad everyone else is alright, though
thanks XAX and WallDives
/me da feel when you realize the majority of good wet mane pics were made by john joseco
Ninjazz: http://derpy.me/erUAU
niny?...
Wut.
Ninjazz: The smooth jazz video you linked earlier, I just now realised that it loops.
Ghosties: Except for me ;-;
Kammerjunk: Just now?... How do you feel are you okay?
I could be much, much. Better.
Not sure.
04What's wrong, XAX
Hey everyony
It's all a bit hazy. I blame the music. It's so SMOOTH.
hi Very_Silly_Filly.
Om: I'm not sure whether I should smile, blush, get angry, annoyed, pissed off... I don't know... O__e
I woke up in a pile of blood this morning :s
And no, it's not a period, because I'm male.
hello very_silly_filly
Ghosties: Sick. Just a general stomach bug.
hey Very_Silly_Filly sorry to hear about that any idea how it happened
/me saves the picture anyway >.>
04Oh, I'm sorry XAX :(
Well my heavily damaged wrist has managed to cut open the skin
04I hope you feel better
and It's been bleeding like fuck.
octavia~ http://derpy.me/qpbqP
Ghosties: <3
04Wow, Filly, perhaps a doctor is needed?
Ninjazz: http://derpy.me/ZmIcD have some more smiles, at others expense eh?
... I hope you're okay, Very_Silly_Filly.
Ghosties: Mums already rung up the docs
hope you feel better Very_Silly_Filly
I'll be fine ;) I've had worse
Om: You know how I feel about Trixie, Om. I think she would never cry just because of that... She's just too prideful.
04Ah, well, how did it go?
very_silly_filly I will try to fix the cut with my mind
Very_Silly_Filly: tis but a scratch as 'were
I've already put a bandage on it
Ninjazz: The highest fall the furthest.
Already completely red ;)
Doesn't mean she will cry.
Ninjazz: There is no point in trying to justify it to yourself.
I hate when her fanon makes her such a insecure, just want to be loved mare.
04Um...you might wanna go to a hospital..
It's my headcanon. I can justify it for myself.
It's just blood, nothing serious
04How much?
Dunno, lots?
http://derpy.me/KBcZW
04Lots, and you say it's just blood :I
Ninjazz: I can't read the word "headcanon" without picturing someone with a cannon sticking of their mouth.
Like I said, I've had worse
04Doing what?
lol XAX
I did this before when I crushed my wrist in a car accident
well that makes my werid dream seem inconsequntionlal
Had to have I think it was 4 bones replaced.
I love how you're filling up this chat with wet manes, Spectrum_Rush. ^^
XAX: Ninjazz http://fim.413chan.net/art/src/132177323722-HeadCannon.png
ouch
Ninjazz: Just saying, you don't lie unless you have something to hide.
Spectrum_Rush: THANK YOU
Ninjazz: well no one else is anymore
04Jesus...you don't have much luck do you, Filly?
No, not really :/
Om: You have a good point. But I don't care about her... I know that sounds like a jerk move... But first impressions and her continued support through her own fanon... annoys me.
I realised that after I managed to shoot a friend in the shoulder with an airsoft by accident
Spectrum_Rush: You know I appreciate it. ^^
Confound those sensitive triggers
Ninjazz: changing it up slightly http://derpy.me/kYNR2
Ninjazz: You dissliker her because she has support?
04Ninjazz, you mean like Sethisto supporting his obsession over her?
was he hurt badly Very_Silly_Filly
Hey everypony...
Not just that... Just how much she gets over ponies WHO should.
hey BronyJenkins|RAGED hows your day been
04Like?
No, other than having to have the pellet removed surgically
Hello BronyJenkins|RAGED, and hello everypony.:)
Ninjazz: Like Rarity.
And well... She's dislikeable pony.
BronyJenkins|RAGED: t u raged?
hello BronyJenkins|RAGED, TheRainbowDash.
04Hmm, I suppose
Not just Rarity... Celestia as well.
I have Coeliac. O_o
Ninjazz: I'M a disslikeable pony.
hi there TheRainbowDash how's ur day been!
Specially Celestia.
Hello BronyJenkins|RAGED and TheRainbowDash
hey TheRainbowDash hows your day been
Hey, Dashie.
04I'll give you Celestia, Trixie certainly seems to have much more support and love than Celestia does
Om: So?
Magical_pab|Music: Yesterday was absolutely flawless, and today maybe even be better than ysterday, so of course, I'm doing amazing.:)
Zzzz
Ghosties: I agree, Trixie has Meanwhile after all ;)
So pretty much a bad day. :P
http://derpy.me/2hEmj swappin it up
You see? Celestia doens't do anything wrong and she gets hated. Trixie?... She's a gosh darn antagonist.
/me sighs
Ninjazz: I know, I hate Trixie with a dying passion.
YOU DO?!
TheRainbowDash :>
Yes, I do.
/me hugs TheRainbowDash
Sounds like chocolate toast
Ninjazz: Yay!:D
You do not know how happy I am to hear that! ^^
TheRainbowDash: that really is a good news! i'm really happy to hear this :D!
We just cant accept all the ponies can we
I'mma go get some!
04Well, you have support in your hatred of Trixie since Val despises her too
Even Val?...
Magical_pab|Music: Yeah, got a bunch of awards and what not, I got the persidental award for excellence, or something like that.
Wow...
If you have Val, you cannot lose.
TheRainbowDash you off from school now?
Indeed.
Ohai everypony
Hello Jim!
Hey Jim!
hey Jim hows your day been
alexxm: Today, offcailly, is my first day of summer break.
TheRainbowDash: really? GREAT! i'm happy 4 ya!
I feel so happy for some reason ^^
Must be summer
TheRainbowDash: RECOGNIZE ME. I said your name with a :>, implying I was meaning to say hi.
Lol.
Indeed. ^^
Magical_pab|Music: Yeah, it is apparently one of the highest academic awards in the whole country. (United States)
good to hear TheRainbowDash i have about another month before my summer break starts
not gonna be forgetin' soarin' http://derpy.me/JHgbr
XAX: Oh, hello, sorry, derp.:D
Whatever happened to Val? He hasn't been around lately.
All dem ,
You got an award, TheRainbowDash?
XAX: I use commas a lot, but I speak fast.
Ninjazz: Actually, several of them.
Huh. Nice. Which ones?
/me grants TheRainbowDash his congratulatory hugs.
/me hugs TheRainbowDash well done
Morning everypony
I sense an incoming text wall.
Hey Shimmer!
hey Shimmer hows your day been
morning, Shimmer.
goodmorning shimmer
I sense that after I post a meme relevant to Bronystate others will..
Ninjazz: I got perfect attendance throughout the whole year, an award for the highest grade percentage average in a class (Science), the presidental award for excellence, completion of middle school, and I will be attending an IB program next year, so will be taking AP/IB classes in high school.
My face is tired
alexxm: it just started :)
Yup
Got it. :3
x.x
Hello Shimmer!
04Congrats TheRainbowDash
Hiya TheRainbowDash
Back with chocolate toast
Sweet
Ghosties: D'awwww, thanks.
:)
Awesome. ^_^
:D
Daayuum, nice! TheRainbowDash. :)
TheRainbowDash, congrats, you overachiever.
great to hear TheRainbowDash well done
Very_Silly_Filly: Fuuu making me hungry
/me sings "Hey, I just met you,and this is crazy,but here’s my number,so call me, maybe?" this song is stucked in my head :D:D
04No prob
That's awesome TheRainbowDash
WallDives: What? Overachiever?:D
TheRainbowDash: Why you so good at things?
StefOfAllPonies: Because I actually try hard in school.
sticked*
TheRainbowDash: Well, as do I.
You mean Stuck?
:P
Ghosties: do you know what happened to ValtheJean? He seems to have disappeared lately.
Magical_pab|Music i think you mean stuck
04Yeah, he's around
04Not on right now, though
StefOfAllPonies: Oh, cool to hear. Did you get promoted to high school/graduate from high school yet?
Tha'ts cause he goes by Caramel.
04^That too
^^
alexxm: stuck sticked is almost the same.... isn't it?
Ninjazz: Eh, that pony is overrated/
Hey I just number, and this is maybe; but here's my met you, so call me crazy.
I don't remember seeing Caramel lately either. I can't help but think he got in trouble the last time he trolled us.
TheRainbowDash: I didn't even know he was popular... And DON'T say that around Val. :S
Kandarihu: In trouble? By who?
I have nopony to stay with, and am proud. I honestly don't want a partner. I'd rather spend time with an animal than a person
Magical_pab|Music i guess so sticked just doesn't sound right
TheRainbowDash: No, atleast I don't think so xD
Ninjazz: I know, if I do, I'll get heavily in trouble.:D
Who else, the other mods.
/me sings "Hey, I just met you,and this is crazy,but here’s my number,so call me, maybe?" this song is STUCK in my head :D:D
Very_Silly_Filly: People tend to make things complicated anyway.
alexxm: happy now? :D
Exactly, he nearly kicked someone just for saying "Caramel is worse pony".
Kandarihu: What did he do recently, and what was his punishment?
Magical_pab|Music: Cool. You said it once
I learn from experience
Very_Silly_Filly: Good cuz we're all ponies in here anyways :)
sorry Magical_pab|Music
/me since my browser is on the verge of a severe crash i here by end what i dub Wet Mane Hour thx for lookin at the pic ev'rypony :)
It's my parents fucking daily routine to argue
Ninjazz: Holy hay, really?
It's quite normal Very_Silly_Filly :)
Awwwww, Spectrum_Rush. :<
thanks for the pics Spectrum_Rush
alexxm: :D <--- dat face means laughing i'm not in anger :)
Spectrum_Rush: 10pm my time is Wet Mane hour. I shall remember this.
Maybe you weren't around for it. He was streaming anime just like usual, when some people started complaining. So he ran the World's Greatest Tea Party again, in it's entirety...
TheRainbowDash: Eyup. Caught it and chewed him out for it. Just told him to keep your opinions to yourself.
Spectrum_Rush: I came in late, so I didn't even to view one single picture.:D
*get to
TheRainbowDash: I even posted my smooth jazz. You missed a good thing. :3
XAX: thats around 5am for me
Ninjazz: Wow, that is abuse of power then.
...then he started trolling us with creepy pictures of G3.6 Scootaloo for a loooong time.
Kandarihu how many times did he stream it that week
XAX: i know. dat alexxm keep correcting me so i corrected it. :D:D
Spectrum_Rush: Lol
Ninjazz: Damn it...:D
TheRainbowDash: That's just Val being Val. He warned it alteast.
him*
TheRainbowDash: I dunno, I've been kicked a few times by SB just for teh ololz
I shall now go and sift through my To Read list, and see if there's anything I want to read.
Very_Silly_Filly: For the lulz is fine, but when Val makes a kick, it is usually serious.
Ninjazz: READ IT NOW :<
SB is just a silly filly Very_Silly_Filly.:D
TheRainbowDash: anypony wet mane you'd like to see i'll post one for you
But I thought SB was a stallion :/
XAX: Now?... :S
good morning my everypony
Ninjazz: If you want
Well, I get the sense that he went too far on that. It ran long enough that people who were coming in would come in on G3.6 Scootaloo trolling.
Spectrum_Rush: Rainbow Dash and Scratch are the only two I want to see.
Hello spitfirecolt!
Morning spitfirecolt
Spectrum_Rush: Spitfire in socks > everything

Spectrum_Rush: Serriously... I'm going to get that pony so bad with that one. >:3
Spectrum_Rush: ...mmmNah. I'm not liking the style of drawing tbh
Spectrum_Rush: Sure, I have time....running out.:D
TheRainbowDash: Dat wish. :P
Mmm. I love chocolate toast
XAX: to each there own
I have to go in about an hour, for a high school graduation...
You're graduating already?...
You just got out of Middle school!
Hey, I'm leaving school next year
Ninjazz: Nah, it is for my brother now.
Frankly, if I were to ever have a chance to stream, I'd have something pony related to troll with that isn't as bad as G3.
Ah...
Doesn't seem 5 minutes since I was in year 7
Ninjazz: Silly filly..:D
Right. Tell him I said congrats as well. :$
Or to you guys, would it be grade 9?
At age 11-12?
http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/303/016/36e.png
/me runs for his life
But I would have to build a MLP fanvid playlist for when people are good.
I sure will Ninjazz, but unforanutaely, he does not like ponies.:<
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx9q-LUaSF0
Very_Silly_Filly what year were you in year 7

Ninjazz: Yeah, the AJ drawing by Wreky.

Ninjazz: It is turned on for that one drwing, yes.
04Just giving you a heads up
/me hugs XAX
Don't do something like that again, man. :$
TheRainbowDash: let me see if I can help you.
XAX: Yeah, over the top of sauciness, but still, that was good.:D
Ninjazz: o_o, you go do that now.
Gimme a moment.
Ninjazz: Don't help him if he's 15 lol :)
Ghosties: I hope and plead that I can be forgiven for my sins.
i had a werid dream last night
Bleh. Age limits.
Yeah, I am 13, bro.:D
:P
I'm 15 in July. D:
I mean... I know what the TheRainbowDash does in her sleep... I think she can handle Wrek's art.
I'm turning 22 in 11 hours
04Only if you pray to the almighty pickle of Thorpston
Ninjazz: Yeah, yeah, just get on with it.
Shush, then.
Ghosties: Who ever prays to that?:\
04XAX would
04If he wants to be forgiven
Ah, I see..:D

I found a bullet on the table :/
But first a quick refresh. :$
Ooh, it's for the Luger
TheRainbowDash: http://derpy.me/n71-n Rainbow Dash
Very_Silly_Filly: You should make sure your parents ain't doing the arguing with guns
Very_Silly_Filly what game are you playing
hey everybrony
alexxm: This is real life
TheRainbowDash: http://derpy.me/jH3vJ and vinyl
Spectrum_Rush: o////o....holy...hay.....
Owch
Hello HiImSpike!
Hello HiImSpike.
hey HiImSpike hows your day been
good thanks
I have a small collection of guns
Hiya HiImSpike
Spectrum_Rush: Hnnng.....
And some of them happened to have ammo in them when I got them
anyone doing live
The deed is done.
ah right thanks Very_Silly_Filly how many do you have
13
TheRainbowDash: sorry it took so long my browser is derpin' real bad from The Wet Mane Hour
I did have another one somewhere, but I lost it
Spectrum_Rush: Doesn't matter to me, at least you got them both.:)
I even have a hat collection consisting of around 20
Very_Silly_Filly: Any unusuals?
cool:)
[/badjoke]
I do have a Luger from WWII
Lady Gaga hats?
I got that from my great grandad
I only have 1 gun. and its all I need.
Cool
I do have 1 gun which is for self defence if needed
Just a crappy glock though
true
Shimmer: if that happens, guns will be the least of problems.
I want a crossbow pistol
I would love to get one of them
:D
I got plans laid out already
If that happens, I plan to die. Plain and simple.
If it happens, I'm going alone.
Ninjazz: its a shame that hour was so active most of the links have rolled out of the chat
We can't have guns in England. D:
If zombies happen, I'll drive to the local gunstore, stock up, then blow the 2 bridges connecting the island I live on to the mainland
chuck norris house
Shimmer: the problem is, so is everyone else.
GlutenFreeJenkins: You can, but you have to be licenced and all that stuff
:)
Spectrum_Rush: Eh... It was us and only us alone that gets to enjoy them.
Which sucks.
There is a weapon shop down my road in fact
WallDives: According to hollywood, everyone will run around screaming like headless chickens
I'll just get some Knifes and become badass instead.
Well im screwed anyway
knives*
I'm trying to create a gun
More powerful than any one I've ever come across
Shimmer you do know everyone else will be going to the gun store and if the guy who owns the store is still alive he might not like people trying to take his stock
Ive got a boat and wait till its over
I'll probably run into a DIY shop, and stock up on axes.
haaaaa me to
GlutenFreeJenkins: Yeah, but if you have melee weapons, you have to be careful not to be bled on
Especially on the wounds
Yeah, I wouldn't have much choice though.
Fishing?
I live in a pretty dangerous place. As illiegal as it is
WallDives: The gun store is right around the corner for me, and I got a decently powered car, I'll take my chances on being first :p
I always have a knife with me, just in case
Actually I live in Australia so I would just go to the south pool and live with the pigeons
/me WMH never again or not for a week i think i've gone cross eyed6_9
HiImSpike: lol pigeons
I guess it helps that my grandad has a land rover
Shimmer there is still the issue with the gun store owner not wanting people taking his stock
every swiss who was in the army have a assault rifle at home so that's no problem for mee^^
I'm always ready
Get a convoy live in RE: EXTINCTION. :3
thanks i forget
like*
My only problem will be food
alexxm: I'm quite skilled in the arts of deception, I'ma trick him into thinking I wanna help
I'll have to live on cake for a few days
and eggs from my chickens
scootalo
:D
/me sings "Iwill not die, i'm waiting for you! I feel alive, when u're biside me! Iwill not die, i'm waiting for you! in my time of dying..."
I want an orange chicken, JUST to call him/her Scootaloo
Very_Silly_Filly: You should go get a chicken farm then.
Bunch of Scootaloos walking around.
TheRainbowDash: I have 7 scootaloos
Doing jazz.

HOW IS GONNA COME AT MOVIE NIGHT?
So the parents will have to stress with problems. :I
Whatever. Suicides is never the answer.
Ninjazz: Nah, not an overreaction.

quitters^
:D
TheRainbowDash: That's all good but ask Ninjazz if he can borrow you some of his modesty ;)
:$
Shimmer: I have modesty, but I only use it at some times.:D
because thats giving up on yourself, and dissapointing everyone else who ever helped you and believed in you.
this world needs more pinkie pie
Indeed.
One time me and keith got bombed by the military then got arrested for being on the battle field.
TheRainbowDash: .. Thats one way to put it :D
spitfirecolt: You kidding me? More Dash.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cI4aAAdEV0&list=FLonDu8VRPY4NPFTD1tyZUoA&index=3&feature=plpp_video

spitfirecolt: Yay!...favorite pony then?
TheRainbowDash: xD
Well... Rainbow's descent was alright
A fic, XAX?

lol
spitfirecolt: You deserve so much respect and brohoofs from me.:) (\
Or eyepatch emergencies.

I post jazz now. :P
TBH, Rainbow Dash would pratically be jailed for breaking our ears with the Sonic Rainboom.
Ninjazz: ... eyepatch.. emergency?? :s
pinkie has everything u need hidden in ponyville
Spell-of-Gaming: Yeah, so much sound, that it'll break a lot of things.
Airpuff: Pirates... Yar.
Ninjazz: .. :D
One time me and Gabe Newell ate sandvich. Heavy was happy with that. Then scout emerged in rage and said that his Bonk Atomic Punch is better then his sandvich
Spell-of-Gaming: Also, it kind of distorts the colors in a small radius.
Ninjazz: Rainbow Factory prequel. Quite Average
I'm waiting for Rainbow Dash to break the Harukei Border.
XAX: o_o....what about Rainbow Factory?
Deploying pony jazz in three... two... one... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBJoB8PBhgQ

Jim: lets break him in
Oh dude I almost forget I was in an Irish Pub on Monday oh dat cider :D
alexxm thanks :) hope it worked lol
Ghosties: .....

yep i got it Rainbow_Crash
INB4 Linux disk check
/me falls and crash glomps Ghosties in a massive crater
ohh good then :)
but I suppose you have to wipe the drive now
Ghosties: what do you mean lie?
04"It's gonna be great"
Ghosties: yes it is true
04Yeah...if you don't pay attention to what's actually going on in the fandom
True.
Very true...
Politics.
whats happening Ghosties the only bronies i talk to are hear
04Not just politics
Not just?
04Corruption, greed, slander, envy, social climbers
I do
/dev/sda2 on /mnt/sda2 type ext3 (rw)
basically, any community?
that's just <censored> up
Please do not swear. You have sworn 30 time(s). Bad moderator/administrator!
04Not really
That sadly is the human nature Ghosties...
We can be called a community now?
i guess so Ninjazz
04The Brony fandom tends to have a looooooooooot more knee-jerk reactions to small and trivial things
04Most of the people in the fandom tend to lay all of their personal problems on the table with each other
React to ALL the things!
True, Ghosties.
04So what happens then is that because everybody puts their problems out for everybody else to see, then nothing gets fixed
I know I have.
04Nothing gets better
i am jumpinh on l4d2
Hello Bronystate
04Plus, "love and tolerance" is a really, really bad mantra to have. Good in theory, but does not work in execution
Ghosties: wow.
Ghosties: i was just trying to welcome the new herd member
Ghosties: Especially considering how typical bronies react to cloppers.
But can't just talking about things make things better?
tl;dr :P Nah, jokes
Pretty well, alexxm
04Oh?
and yours?
04Eh, don't let me ruin this shit for you
Ghosties: I don't see any love and tolerance in that spectrum/
04It can be good, there are some good things if you look really close and really hard
You can't love everybody and of course you can't tolerate everything Ghosties ,but I don't see why this wouldn't work MOST of the time
Love and tollerance is a anti-troll weapon to me, nothing more.
04^
04That's all it EVER was
04That's why it started
04It was meant to counter trolls
04But like I said, I don't wanna ruin the show for someone
04The show is great
04There's no reason not to watch
People try to tell me Love and Tolerate is their life style
Its great we have diffrent opinions
/me pats Ghosties on the back
They refuse to believe it was originally an anti-troll phrase
04I dunno man
04It's just...hard sometimes
I know...
04When you see things that you thought you wouldn't see happen in the fandom...it...kinda gets to you
Isn't everything worthwile, Ghosties
All this is just so surreal. Good and bad, just weird sometimes too.
Sometimes?... Most of the time.
what does that mean Ghosties?
fandoms tend to be difficult to deal with.
Ghosties every fandom has a bad side
Cosplays *shrugs*
I think it's the people who take the show to heart. Who litterally let it guide them.
I mean there are lessons.
04That is true, you are right alexxm
Hey guys
hey Comet hows your day been
hi Comet.
Hello Comet.
Hey Comet !
Hello Comet
hey Comet
hi comet
Zzzz
My eyes are irritated x.o

04Good morning, Comet. It is less than 2 minutes to 9 AM where I'm at
2 to 8
Ghosties as i said i only rellay talk to bronies be so i'm assuming the bad side is just a vocal minority
2 till 11pm
Ghosties: Up all night again, or woke up recently?
A very LOUD vocal minorty, alexxm.
True
Recently as in 1-2 hours ago
13I'm probably really late in seeing this, but http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBdp_dLEdqU

Elondras, theres a few austrians and germans that come by.
WallDives: oh really? sounds nice :)

Well, I'm only 4 episodes behind Sumica. If I have an hour before I lose the computer this afternoon, I'm going to watch another 2.
A few years ago, I crushed my wrist in a car accident, and I had a few of the bones inside amputated because they were literally reduced to granuales
ewww
The amputation gave out last night and gouged my wrist leaving me to wake up in a pile of blood :/
3 more after that and I'll be able to start commenting on the problems with the dub properly.
guys i watched every single my little pony episode twice thats almost 40 hours of my little pony
Very_Silly_Filly: I... I'm sorry to hear that
LoGaN good for you
Very_Silly_Filly: ouch. Are you alright? :O
I went to the doctors today, came back a few minutes ago
I'm gonna have the amputation replaced with a new one on Saturday
Well, I'm fine other than the fact it stings like absolute hell
Very_Silly_Filly, wow. If I remember, I'll keep you in my prayers.
WHERE did princessmolestia go?
I'm more worried about my bedsheet than anything else naturally
Almost didn't have enough stars left to make that constellation, but I got it :)
Very_Silly_Filly: we'll all be thinking of you, bud.
It's completely stained

CCCP depends how long you cook them
07you'd have to check that with a dentist lol

AzulaSurge: :D awesome
most people need them taken out
and it sucks
11,01And I do nothing but weather.
Very_Silly_Filly: lol :D

I'll ask a dentist
I might need this thing removed
/me bops to the song.

CCCP: indeed, tastes like metal too :D
Blood tastes wierd
God damnit, who would have thought the DUBSTEP of all things would get me into electronic music XD
It feels like it's intruding or something
11,01Well that was fun.
it taste like koolaid CCCP
and only the corner ripped through my gums
Very_Silly_Filly: Ow. I hate that coppery taste.
AzulaSurge: yeah
I woke up with quite a bit on my face as well

Blood is tasty. Well my blood tastes good, to me. I have not had the chance to taste anypony elses...yet.
Very_Silly_Filly I once worked in a laboratory, where we sometimes got samples of Blood from a Butcher...
alexxm: is it good?
AzulaSurge: No, about 700 ml blood loss from a gouged wrist

11,01Very_Silly_Filly: Wut?
Rain is amazing

Nittany_Discord: As some may know, I have amputated wristbones after crushing it in a car accident, around 4-6 bones were recuded to dust
brb checking out the new things in the Humble Bundle V :3
:)
Very_Silly_Filly: :'( amputation?
11,01Do you have your hand?
Yeah, but it's so easy to pull out
that's what she said
Very_Silly_Filly: im sorry to here that:'(
I just had a flashback of the first time I had teeth removed there, I got gassed
11,01Ow.
NOT NOW WORLDTRAVELER.
The skin is connected, but the tendons and such are very very weak
Wow. mips is not lagging.
I had an amputation
lawl
Very_Silly_Filly: That sucks
ugh
11,01Are they going to fix that?
this ice chewing isn't helping
Was my lag a memory problem?
next thing I knew my gum had extended like a balloon
fffffffffffffffff
I've never been gassed
And it gave out last night and gouged the hell out my wrist
:(
insurance didn't cover it
i looove lag too :D :D
I feel like i want to just get the gums ripped
<3 lag
On saturday, I shall have a new sort of amputation put in

i wish real life had lag
k
I'm sorry to hear that.

11,01How do you put in a removal?
Should both keep my hand in place, and also be less sharp
Very_Silly_Filly: U okay???:'(
\me
hrm
11,01And amputation is the removal of something.
11,01*An
Very_Silly_Filly: wuuuut??! :o
let's use a shot glass as a measureing medium
mips lags for me only with a very active chat
LOL
how much salt do I put in a full shot glass?
xD
I had most of my wristbones replaced, yeah
Mips never lags usuaally

Wrek: hi

11,01Maybe one day, you'll get your full wrist back.
Very_Silly_Filly: Best of luck towards recovery
Yeah, I've gotten used to the pain and the movement of my arm

RainBowJack: :3
o_o
oh

I have measuring spoons
but eh
Is my chat broken?
well bye bye i am going to hit the hay
6I don't know measurements well

Very_Silly_Filly: That explains why you haven't been around? =/
Lil_B: Nope
6thing about home remedies is you just kinda /know/
Vordox: Yep

6swish it around the tooth yeh
Very_Silly_Filly: :(
just swish it in my mou- k
brb
INB4 IT BURNS
:s
Very_Silly_Filly: that sucks
my name now flutterguy
I think the biggest worry was the amount of blood loss
11,01I'd hate to have disabled or missing limbs.
Terraria server for Bronystate fans is up =3
6warm salt water shouldn't cause extensive pain with teeth
Nittany_Discord: It is a drag, but at least I can use it kinda
Vordox... well, count me in XD as always
So i walk in on Wrek drawing? ^^
panda, close, Kirz.
Nah, it's kirzstryfe
Very_Silly_Filly: Have they told you how long the recovery will take?
Obsidian: Around a year to fully settle
kirzstryfe: Wanna join and help killing bosses?
My last one took about 10 months
WallDives: hehe i didnt know that kirz drew
panda: hi :3
Nittany_Discord: I'm a big reader, the thought of being blind disturbs me to no end.
Randomnerd: What do you read?
Being blind would REALLY suck for me
I'm sorry, that's very ableist thinking -_-
I hope I never have a wisdom teeth problem z.z
I should not say such things.
I have a poor sense of smell and touch
Randomnerd: at least now there's audiobooks
6how old are you?
suddenly
11,01As a gamer and storm chaser, being blind and/or losing a limb would be a disaster for me.
wisdom teeth problems
sagas: I read a lot of History, and fantasy novels.
Everwhere
everybody I know
I grew some wisdom teeth
are like getting their teeths out
never got any from it >> *drum/symbol*
/me runs
Randomnerd: Good taste
storm chaser Nittany_Discord
?
Nittany_Discord: My trigger finger is around 1 shot at a rate of 1.5-3 sec
Nittany_Discord: seconded
It's that slow
and..battery is like at 10%
Vordox... I'm there as soon as Steam feels like beeing ready :/
just great
6wisdom teeth are generally removed between 17-21 years of age
/me just learned Nittany_Discord was a storm chaser
Lil_B: Heh :P
yeah
6during that time, you find out if they'll be a problem or not
11,01LoGaN: Yes. I chase storms around.
I have some bits of them growing in
6or in my case, where they're completely sideways, you get them out immediately
6lol
11,01Though I haven't done it in over a year.
nice are you on the show Nittany_Discord
11,01No.
I couldnt do it.
Very_Silly_Filly: at least you can still move it. Nerves are not entirely damaged
are they generally smaller than molars?
look at all these bath salts
Nittany_Discord: Why the break?
Nittany_Dsicord: So you'rea tornado stalker?
aww
Is RAWRity around?
/me nomz
too scared from the tornado I delt with.
Whoops
11,01Can't afford to chase.
/me ducksj
hi Octavarium
this song makes me sleepy
:/
CCCP: Well I guess we better smoke them
That's better.
sagas: xD
Anyway, is RAWRity around?
hello ScootaChicken :D
/me is nommed
not atm i think ScootaChicken
I need to commend him.
nope ScootaChicken
hi yah
11,01I was almost run over by a large tornado last year. My biggest regret that day was losing my phone.
Nittany_Discord: Yikes.
It's amazing.
11,01And the fact that the damn tornado was wrapped in rain.
does anypony know when Therainbowdash will get on?
6no
Nittany_Discord: You almost get injured, and you worry about your phone
ScootaChicken: which one?
I lol'd
Nittany_Discord: "No! Not my $200 iPhone!"
LoGaN: WHY? :[
Oh gog
I mean the one with FlareChaser
11,01I didn't find it missing until after the incident.
Tornados are scary as hell.
6they're about the same size
11,01And I wanted to go see more tornadoes.
ScootaChicken: >_< link me on skype
I'm glad we don't have those here
Gunther what?
Nittany_Discord: sounds pants shitting terrifying and awesome at the time. This side of the world seldomly has tornadoes
Oh hey ScootaChicken, we found out that Kenne didnt have a clue what the song "I am the Walrus" is. Also that he doesnt listen to the Beetles.
"injured"? That's not how you spell "killed".
11,01Last year was tornado hell.
RX-78-SweetieBot: ...where is he.
I don't know the circumstances of Tornado chasing
HE WILL SUFFER
THE FULL BRUNT OF MY WRAAAAAATH
RX-78-SweetieBot: What! Impossible!
Wasn't sure whether to say, killed, hurt or injured
I'm a naturally nervous person :(
ScootaChicken: right now on xbox, but I think skype as well
well, I think mine are kinda small
11,01200 in one day. Another one kills 100+ (I chased and caught my first tornado that day).
way at the back
/me is tired of playing ponymusic on audiosurf.
RX-78-SweetieBot: Tell him that ScootaChicken thinks he's a twat.
6they always start at the back
Nittany_Discord: Did you pit it in a jar with air holes and keep it for a few weeks?
seems to be enough spacing back there
ohwell
*put
hey guys.
11,01Stallion_of_War: Nah. It escaped.
:O
hi DarkStar.
It managed to destroy the plant pots and some other small things
8,6this is STYX
Stallion_of_War: No he relesed it into the wild later. Killed another 50 people
Hello DarkStar
6http://gofme.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/opg.jpeg
6thats a lucky person's wisdom teeth
LoGaN: Why do you need to know?
Apparently a tornado tore down a barn back like, 30 years ago or so, on our farm.
idk
Doofus
hrm
11,0150 people dying from a single tornado is almost unheard of now.
only delt with one tornado in 2000, and we left after that.
seems a bit like mine
Nothing was in it except for junk
though
is tempted to spam copypasta
BLAZE!
My left side is almost finished
but my right side is

Nittany_Discord: Yay warning systems!

CCCP: Sometimes tolerating can be very hard, what did you have in mind though?
CCCP: I disagree. I love and tolerate and im a brony
Holy crap, it's absolutely pissing it down in bloody lakes up at England
