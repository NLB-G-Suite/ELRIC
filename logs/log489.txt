awww but i hate football =3

I know that much
Germany here =3
It's 4:30 am in the east.
I'm in America, I was born in the The Netherlands.
We only have Hockey
and Canadian football.
which one?
And I COULD cheer for the Canucks, but their season is over
dont remind me...
/me sighs
Just watch it.
so...uh...yeah. Dat Fighting is magic.
dont know, but probably later than October.
I want it. It looks like fun.
Plus there's a code to get 15% off any T-shirts you buy
fight is magic deserves money if ya ask me
^
maybe, but if they dont want it, we cant give it to them.
yeah i guess but still
and that would be bad.
tbh? I dont.
Yeah like SPONGEBOB!
I hope it has 5-6 seasons TOTAL. I dont want the series to burn out, run out of aesops, or turn into something I dont want to see.
that being said, if they can maintain quality somehow, then please let it happen for a long time
technically, the Movie IS the end.
Reminds me of The Simpsons
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaG-JijAr-c&list=UUfBfjK2Gg777FLAWrAZ6Slg&index=1&feature=plcp
all the episodes, happen before the movie, iirc.
i think they burned themselves out on the movie or something
That movie happened a while ago, actually
Wow
opinion...
not saying I like it, I dont watch it.
I don't really watch that show either
but if its really that bad? it wont be on the air. raitings and adverts and all that.
Spongebob neither
You know what's stupid? People were sueing Spongebob back then because it was "unappropriate". I don't hear much about that little disbute now for some reason
same no one hears about the Pokemon/Evolution arguements.
Usually
i'm going to sleep, Goodnight everyone
Because you ignored the warnings.
yes
my bad :)
and you have to go there. otherwise, you wait until it releases.
they MIGHT have a playable build at EVO, but it hasent been announced.
I hope Oklahoma City wins the finals. Long shot, but still
Where's that located?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmGt0EhVToE&NR=1&feature=endscreen <- I want this idea turned into a episode. But with the mane 6. :)
ok thx :)
there is no playable build atm.
lol
yeah kk thx for the info i mean :)
np.
wa away way we talkin bout
you.
I hope Trixie is playable character
go
And now it's time for some smooth jazz
you should be able to see it played? probably. you probably wont be able to play it until, if I had to guess, maybe November or December.
thats a guess mind. we know it wont be before October, if schedule holds.
ok thx yeah iv seen the live stream of it was awesome cant wait to play it :)
I've seen all the live streams, and I've discussed it quite a bit...
Wait, that doesn't work at all
sure we'll go with that
np.
Anyway, that is a very good idea for an episode

04That's all it EVER was
04It was meant to counter trolls
04But like I said, I don't wanna ruin the show for someone
04The show is great
04There's no reason not to watch
Its great we have diffrent opinions
They refuse to believe it was originally an anti-troll phrase
04I dunno man
04It's just...hard sometimes

The amputation gave out last night and gouged my wrist leaving me to wake up in a pile of blood :/
I went to the doctors today, came back a few minutes ago
I'm more worried about my bedsheet than anything else naturally
It's completely stained
eep, zombies be nommin'
