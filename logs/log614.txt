No problem Spectrum_Rush!
So not Atheism

I was gonna say BP was running on Windows ME, but I thought that would be a little /too/ mean ^^;
mitamaking the word used in the show, yes.

Fuck it. Time to get so drunk I can't see straight.

OtakuTom: Windows 98 SE unpatched?
Or even if there is a God, no one can really know his intentions.
Bronyhawk my computer came with Vista, my old one with XP. Vista has features that make it feel like XP while having the customization of 7. However, it's a RAM hog and I need a 64-bit version so I can upgrade it to 6GB
During an exam? Kick him out of school
Bronyhawk that should let me play TF2 again
2000 was better than ME...I should know from experience :P
Oh, otakon, BP is kicking you because she /likes/ you.
Canadian_Brony: why not step up to 7?
Don't you see?
"Dead Zone" ... gotta be

Canadian_Brony: Can't argue there. I have 7 Ultimate 64 kicking around though, so I'm kind of uninterested in trying other things :3
bye pillo...damn gone
I assume your logic is that, if there is a fourth wall in existence, then a Pinkie must exist to break it.

Mad respect
AJIsAwesome: yeah that was cool, the super seinfeld bros was cool too
I wanted something that I could drop tnt blocks into, then it would spew them out in a semi-random pattern onto the ground, then I could ignite them as I felt like it

Canadian_Brony: Same for Tim's
Dayum netsplits

Canadian_Brony: You've seen the new ones of Improv, right?
flutter_spin yeah. I kinda liked it, but it wasn't as good as "Whose Line"
it got me into "Whose Line" though
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epyR1GWqwtw
Yeah, but those moments like caveman skit or the guy who did samurai sound effects or or or ... POWERFUL

13note to self, there is a reason they invented fritos scoops...
I'm a black scottish cyclops! They got more ***** **** *** ** **** * ** then they got the likes of me.

Phobos2390 with Rifftrax!
PaladinDrakkenwolf: you're on BS sleep is not possible
11,01I can haz wizard? XD
For this, I can simply pause the video and go. For what Caramel streamed, I should've spoken out.
dont see how you can have a rifftrax for perfection but okay
DerpStar: normally im in Steam when that happens
Shizuka: so whos the riffers for this one today?
I like that light-stealing-thingy

Meatloaf

PaladinDrakkenwolf: I like CIV V on steam
DerpStar: TF2 and Borderlands for me
While I pride myself on being a good FPS player TF2 isn't my cup of tea
Dersleys better than the Kennedys? Seems legit.

DerpStar I work on the exact opposite. I can only play TF2 . . . and borderlands.
Ohhhh rifftrax
TheGreatAndPowerfulT eeyup

13this is a great series of riffs
Kandarihu just do it, filly!
damn i hate the actors in this one
goddammit, can i kick dudley's ass yet?
It would probably ruin the fun of the Rifftrax anyway.
Shizuka: Agreed, some of the best (but the The Room riff is still the best)
13THIRTEEN BUT LAST SEASON HAD TWENTY SIX PONIES
Ponies47: the first epi of the adventures of pootisman cracked me up, especially when the heavy started vogue-ing :D

13no post on sundays >3<
Ponies47: heck yeah! i love gmod vids :P
seriously guys http://derpy.me/6wN5m
I know that. you missed my riff.
11,01Shotgun. The perfect spam filter.
NO BLASTED LETTUCE TODAY
"No post on sundays" they said. "No bloody post today!" they said.
oni_link: They can be so random :P
Pudge XDDDDD
all dat spam!
Barbetos: how do you go from that to THAT
How can a single image have so much win
Ponies47: I know, thats why I like them :D
13Canadian_Brony: yeah but this is the first one, they couldn't quasi-swear yet
No spam filter?
I'm pretty sure a lot of guys would go gay for neville
Not me :P
And SOMEHOW Vernon keeps him from reading ANY of them. Gotta give Vernon props for that.
DerpStar they tried and failed.
11,01Danielle Radcliffe is so young in this.
You know what? I should've made this announcement while Caramel was streaming Community. He's not even on anymore. And it wouldn't be fair to Shizuka if my announcement wrecks the fun of HER stream. I'm just going to take Bronystate and Ponychat off my domain block for the time being. If it happens again tomorrow night, that will be the time to make the announcement.
13X3
11,01XD
Canadian_Brony: clearly
Kandarihu: um...
Kandarihu: sorry but what are you talking about
oni_link: I do like SFM but I find Gmod classic. For some video's like Painis Cupcake video's. His ways of moving around can not be re-created in SFM.
13unfortunately this riff comes after their spiderman riff and xmen riff, so they occasionally reference those
Kandarihu cryptic.
Elmer Fudd rifle
is best rifle
Cake
Not really.
Barbetos not sure if that was the announcement
13wait
Yay shhizustream
13raspberry frosting?
XD
13GIVE ME THAT CAKE NOW
I REALLY hope it doesn't come to committing to it. Not really announcing anything now.
and good night everypony
Penguin would kill for that umbrella
Ponies47: I think Gmod is for wackier stuff imo and SFM is for professional looking stuff although they remade a lot of gmod stuff in SFM
Dovah: Night!
/me gives Shizuka a cake with raspberry frosting
nit Dovah
I turned 11 in 1994 ^_^
I know the cake to bake for Shizuka. Whens your birday exactly?
Good night Dovah sleep well
Shizuka: I can make you a strawberry cake with rasberry frosting if you want :3
I know nothing of swine dermatology
Hi, Dudley now proves he has NO REDEEMING QUALITIES WHATEVER.
13Barbetos: may 22 >>
Your a Harry, wizard.
oni_link: Yeah. SFM odes look great but Gmod is always still awesome :3
*you're*
night Dovah
Dudley is actually the best Dursley.
Yu Gi Oh over wizarding?
♪I'm Harry Freakin Potter♪
Night Dovah !
I wonder what the odds are of picking a random address and then hoping it ends up at your home if I order it at a local bakery.
Buytoast: Which is VERY VERY disturbing.
My birthday is December 6th :P
Ponies47: vagineers :D
Barbetos very unlikely
Horribly romantic notion, but it would be fucking insane if it happened. =P
^ my weakness.
13now that we've all seen it
oni_link: meD rseenigav yeht era os deriw
13shouldn't petunia have noted that lily met SNAPE and not just potter?
wait, there was lightning indoors, did anyone else notice that!!!!!!!
she couldn't tell them
apart
Shizuka: >:l Oh, thanks.
Shizuka: roling hadnt thought that far ahead yet :S
13possibly
Shizu and there lies the truth. Rowling did not think that far ahead at this point obviously.
13book was out in like 1999 wasn't it?
Ponies47: hahaha totally XD
lol
*Rowling
oni_link: IKR? :p
Usenet? Does that even EXIST anymore?
Kencolt: yes, yes it does
Spectrum_Rush Shizuka she planned out the entire series with index cards before she started even the first book
ALTHOUGH! I think the script could of been fixed a bit for it.
Is it used?
SO she had not thought of it then either
GAPS!
Yes
Barbetos most likely
alt.sysadmin.recovery still has a pretty large poster-base
Barbetos minor plot hole. Besides, she's a lying bitch. What do you expect?
XD
13well we know by this point she had snape's role laid out since she told alan rickman about it
13by the movie that is
and the snorty spies o,o Ponies47
yo yo yo wuddup
oni_link: Oh yeah dem to :P
Ponies47: crabspies :o
O.O
Professor Foamy T. Sqirrel
he's a celebrity and he doesn't even know it
13another point but mostly cause i don't remember
13do we ever learn quirrel's first name?
Shizuka: Nope :P
Shizuka not that I recall
Samuel
professor S. Quirrel
Quirinus
I love riftrax!
Seriously, Quirinus Quirrell
I always that quirrel was just... a made up body, or something, not a heal host.
D
real*
yep, it's "Quirinus" according to the hp wikia
13that's.... lame
Diagon Alley is so traditional
dats Aliteration
Nimh
I do with that the Movie would quiet down when they commentate
13hopefully i will find time to run chamber of secrets tomorrow
wish even
We're watching Harry Potter...again? xd
*XD
VenHur with Rifftrax
Quirinus?
Really?
XD
This is his first name?
wtf?
Its a traditional saint's name
Well... That is kind of like my real name
I guess
What's up with the intermittent robot voice?
13that's Disembaudio
"Safest place besides Hogwarts". Gets successfully infiltrated by 3 17-year-olds.
pony_1654: it's to sync the Audio with the video
ah
DUUUDE!!!
13a rifftrax is an mp3 you play in sync with a movie, disembaudio echoes lines so you know if you're lined up
13this is a presynced video, it just doesn't have dis removed
I gotta restart my computer. I'll be back.
Shizuka: I have the nametag for you....
13pretty sure most of the others remove dis
seeya Kandarihu
dis?
wut?
@_@
Canadian_Brony well howarts is not that safe anyway i mean all years there is some evil lurking there
Shizuka: most actually keep dis in
ALL DA GOLD! @_@
13well most of the other harry potters
TheGreatAndPowerfulT IKR? 7 years in a row!
Oh god they mentioned the Crystal Skull
Law of Narrative Coincidence. Hogwarts is usually safe...but a "safe" year at Hogwarts would make for a really boring story.
I would continue to watch the Rifftrax version of this film, but it's 12 AM where I lives...maaaybe tomorrow?
Reikim|Drawing IKR?
Harry Potter: Totally Hacked the Gibson
13noooob
This scene gives me chills.....
noob
NOOO0B!!1
that was a good impression :D
iWand
11,01XD
Hai everypony!
hi Biglaw
Hi Biglaw
11,01Revealus Pornus?
... i feel like im' like 30 seconds ahead of the rest of you on the stream...
Nittany_Discord seems legit
Biglaw: Hi!
Nittany_Discord: I would actually like to have that wand :D
MirrorImage ahead or behind?
ahead
Is it just me, or this Ollivander sort of looks like some of the incarnations of The Master?
Hello Biglaw
No no and defenitely not.
:3
In the book didn't they go through ALL the wands?
right now Harry Potter is going all super and glowy for me
oh that sounds so bad...
I would, Sawyer > Kid Rock
11,01Lol.
13Barbetos: yes but movie time
XD
Three sizes
Barbetos I haven't read it in . . . forever.
13you'd have to fade to some time later with piles of boxes and that would just be pointless
suddenly dic chaney XD
>.<
it's a conspiramacy!
It's an elaborate ruse!
In the wizarding world, wand choose you.
Soviet Diagon Alley*
13iirc in the last book he's a bit proud of giving voldemort the wand he did, despite what voldemort went on to do with it
theres no conspiramacy>_>
Ah. the benefit of true neutral.
Well its getting late and hubby just got home so I'm off to bed
13pretty much
In soviet diagon alley, owl turn you into ps3
13his name was VVVVVV
"vvvvt"
11,01His name is $#@G%
SHADDUP KID
/me hugs Canadian_Brony night hun
The Dark Side? He was Vader?
Nittany_Discord: Shag?
Hagrid is pretty non chalant about saying his name at this part
g'night DerpStar
seems.. off
13EH SHE'LL BE FINE
it bothers me
XD
11,01Spectrum_Rush: That's how you pronounce it.
13vvt
DerpStar: Night!
>.<
13if this were a less... serious... ish... series
13they'd pronounce it VVT for the rest of the series
LoLz
so who do i have to thank for the current stream?
13not the wimpy "you know who"
Shizuka: Just like Vampire's s
Suck*
So, who the guy in the commentary?
Connecticut towns
in soviet wizarding world, toad have you
13more plotholes!
Nittany_Discord: He who must not be named is really named a';DROP TABLE users .... if they name him, every wizard looses their name due to a vunerability in magic's kernel....
13well
13unless hagrid can teleport
In soviet wizarding world, ticket stick to you
inception forghorn
XD
13but they snapped his wand so he's not allowed magic
harry potter forever alone
your comments are so far ahead of what I am seeing. It confuseseseseses me
13that would imply hagrid has to take the hogwarts express
Did he just say Owlicious?
13but he gets there before harry
Shizuka - apparition doesn't require a wand that i know of
esesesesessesesesese
maybe he has a portkey in his beard
11,01Or maybe his name is an SQL injection command.
hah
to return home
though given Hagrid's size, it would imply a hell of a "snap"
13MirrorImage: yeah but it's also a case that hagrid's pretty much not allowed to do magic
Shizuka: No He has that moter cycle, no?
Magic, the largest SQL database ever
13he *can* but he shouldn't
Shizuka he has a motorcycle that flies, and we know they can go from London to Hogwarts if you fly
motor*
How else do you explain all the bad latin?
13might be the motorcycle..
How does nobody notice this going on?!?!
The Motorcycle is my best guess.
Honestly woman, you call yourself our mother?
13by this point sirius would be in azkaban though so
Biglaw: magic, duh!
Okay, how the hell do the regular people NOT see this?!
Unnr: :I
13would that mean hagrid just has the motorcycle now?
:D
Major: That's what I'm saying!
Shizuka he carries around his wand all the time though, so it is not to far of a stretch that he does use magic all the time
Shizuka: yeah he never gave it back
Shizuka perhaps he can retrieve it, or he parked it in London.
NEVAR!
YOU SHALL NOT PASS!
LEEEEROY
JEEEENKINNNS
In soviet wizarding world, wall run into you.
I'm telling you
Phobos2390 *through
Biglaw: really! How are they not seeing that?! Theyre doing it right in their faces!
he hides a portkey in his beard
13oh and i have to apologize way way in advance, but the fellowship of the ring riff totally has disembaudio right smack in the middle of YOU SHALL NOT PASS
13it's lame and a half
Major Deception Magic
In soviet wizarding world, train ride you
You know I have never actually noticed a Harry Potter toy.
In Soviet Internet, you is internet meme.
13i remember hogwarts express toys
AND HOW THE HELL IS THE TRAIN NEVER SEEN?!
Barbetos: there was alot of merchandise after this movie
I remember the lego set being the only one that was ever in stock
XD
13Major: pocket dimension
13only way
Shizuka: ARE YOU EXCITED FOR THE HOBBIT?
I missed it I guess.
Major . . . how can they not see Hogwarts?
did anyone else have that harry poter levitation obstacle course game?
PIMP MAH POTTER
Lo
because that was the shit
:p
Shizuka: what Canadian_Brony said
13at some point the train would be deposited onto a line that's maybe discontinued
Biglaw: :D
Does the trolley sell muffins?
Oh mai
The train is never seen because MAGIC.
13well the school they explain as having a metric ton of charms and such to make muggles suddenly remember important appointments and stay away
spinach, liver, tripe, bogey, vomit, semen
ewww
xD
LOL
Lol
can you torrent this shit ?
Look, if anyone complains about any inconsistancy ever again, the default response is MAGIC.
I did my first draft of barbie girl parody everypony
13Reikim|Drawing: snort snort?
If not MAGIC, then CONVENIENCE
Snort snort indeed
kill the rat now
Reikim|Drawing I'll think of something.
save the world
13hm
Reikim|Drawing trust me.
Reikim|Drawing: What about science in the wizardry world?
Shizuka: Then how do the regular people not see them going through the platform? :P
MAGIC
13i see what you mean, you don't see her growing into emma watson either
13ron's mostly there though
fail spell
xD
XD
A hurdy-gurdy spell would be awesome, does it come with monkey?
oni_link you there?
Major: MAGIC.
13Major: timing, although normal people in the harry potter universe must come equipped with extra stupidity that they don't notice anything
holy cricket
eeyup whats up Malk ?
did first draft
Reikim|Drawing: Clark's Second Law- Sutiably advanced science is indistinguishable from magic
XD
Shizuka - it's standard not-protagonist debuff
1
Shizuka: It's called a glamour, and it gets used a lot.
Shizuka: ethier that or they are blind :P
xD
Malk: awesome!
way late. I better go.
omg this is amazing
Reikim|Drawing unless it's "Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy", in which you just go along with it.
for magic and science
It's called a GLAMOUR. Often used by FAIRIES in fantasy settings. Makes us muggles ignore things we're not supposed to see.
I gotta get some sleep. Good night everypony!
11,01Lol.
nite AJIsAwesome
night AJIsAwesome
XD
g'night AJIsAwesome
Canadian_Brony: Nope, if its H2G2 you replace both science and magic with towel

We should have more of these Rifftrax commentary, I really want to see a Flash Gordon one. XD
Saviour of the universe
I should be in bed, but it's much too fun explaining illogical things.
:3
VenHur: or the one and only, the room
Nittany_Discord: Maidus Outfitus?
VenHur I've only seen Shizuka stream Rifftrax, but I'm sure others do aswell.
13let's just settle it now
13maggie smith
Venhur stay up for late night Bronystate more often? Unless you don't live in the states
13best actress in the whole series
If so, lucky bastard
Who's Maggie Smith?
Shizuka: yus
13she is
11,01Spectrum_Rush: The Maid Hour spell?
A B C and D sounds good enough for me
Nittany_Discord: YES
Who does this Smith woman play?
Nittany_Discord: FIND IT
Neville before Neville's a recurring character.
13Reikim|Drawing: mcgonagall here
Aha
13gossip gossip gossip
VenHur IKR?
McGonagall is a pretty badass teacher, especially towards the end.
gossip gossip gossip
:D
gossiogossip
11,01Major: Sure will!
The gossip is MAGIC.
13i'll have to do day after tomorrow too, murmur murmur washing machine!
in the book, Harry and Malfoy meet in Diagon Alley while getting hemmed up for robes.
Washing machine is EEEEEVIIIL! EVIL EVIL EVIL! EEEEEVIIIL!
Nittany_Discord: Find it! And we'll conquer the world! :D
11,01We'll bring world peace.
Nittany_Discord if you can't find a spell, make it.
Canadian_Brony and in the train right?
13all in all it's just a nether brick in the wall
/me happily noms on granola bars :3
Nittany_Discord: and the world will be clean, forever clean!
That is where Malfoy offers his "friendship" right?
Oh look, it's the TrollHat.
Barbetos I don't remember. I just know they met first in Diagon Alley.
11,01Major: Yes.
My Little Malfoy: Backstab is Magic
The only thing that annoyed me about the Potter series was that they never got into the mechanics of inventing spells. They were always pre-made.
11,01And we'll end world hunger.
13the forbidden forest, forbidden to all students except always
11,01And end war forever.
Nittany_Discord: And free puppies for everyone?
13they should have alphabetized this list
The Forbidden Forest: Forbidden unless you're a protagonist, then we'll find EVERY excuse to throw you in there.
11,01And kitties.
that logic both makes perfect sense and also hurts my brain.
11,01Their choice.
13give you six keys for that hat
wasnt it in the book Shizuka ?
Shizuka: Seven :3
XD
You call taht clapping Dumbledore?
Hufflepuff?
not even on his head
All the cool kids go to Gryffindor. All the jackasses go to Slytherin. All the nerds go to Ravenclaw. All the detritus leftover afterwards go to Hufflepuff.
I see one, two, three...seven as-I mean, keys.
13fliffnpiff
YAY!
HUFFERPUFF
I got it :3
ermegerd, herferpurf
ermegerd gryfernder
Huff-n-puff
:p
13this list is horribly sorted
*dramatic silence*
11,01A Weasely? Expelled!
XD
Shizuka the hat did the sorting.
No Nittany_Discord, DEPORTED!
Shizuka: its a bogosort
It's sorted according to the Laws of Dramatic Timing, Shizuka.
Or one million years dungeon Nittany_Discord
13Unnr: that makes so much sense... my god...
13could be worse i suppose
11,01Biglaw: :<
/me hugs and brushes Nittany_Discord
13they could be insertion sorting them..
Nittany_Discord: For the weasly~
13the rest of the next two hours would be them moving every student back one to make room
And now I am imagining the sorting hat eating a hot pocket.
that would be so messy
awesome ^
Barbetos CANNOT UNSEE
11,01Biglaw: K.

Man, Harry looks so young here. I'm used to seeing him as a young adult.

this is why magic carpets are better for starters
Shizuka IKR?
Dat Gobster
13neville has an obscene amount of points in his Luck stat
and then madame hooch was never seen again
Shizuka mind you, I've seen a similar accident and only a broken wrist
Shizuka: Eeyup
Shizuka - could use a few more, obviously
so it's actually quite accurate
13nah she pops up again in the quidditch match
And that's makes 5 points from Gryffindor for a student's injury.
or could've at least done with not choosing Intelligence as the dump stat

nope not a spoiler :U
Shizuka - i'm more concerned that they teach a first year the spell to open it

Shizuka: Where? O.O
/me is not the troll
SIIIIIIIIIIIILEEEEEEEEEEENCE
Screaming and Hollaring
/me panics
NOPE, panic!
You know, troll in the dungeon, send everyone to their dorms
Shizuka: We needs a spy check
13see i like richard gambon as dumbledore
waiiit, two of those dorms are located in the dungeon
dem d12s
13but that SILENCE shout was awesome
Unnr, Hogwarts logic
Dumbledor is trying to kill all the slytherines and hufflepuffs
Horray for wizard logic!
seems legit
Unnr: Troll in the dungeon? Better send the students to their dorms, IN THE DUNGEON.
PillowPoni - in all fairness, how many dungeons does Hogwarts have?
wood door protect me!
MirrorImage: ummm 5?
MirrorImage: but he never did say *which* dungeon the troll was in
MirrorImage I don't think the troll is an alien, so that could pose a problem
MirrorImage: To be honest, I have no clue. I would presume a few. Hufflepuff and Slytherin's common rooms are located near the dungeons
IMPOSSIBRU
13handy that they just learned that spell
cool
Ouch.........
Dat musta hurt
Algorithum called ham?
inb4 snot
and "eeeewwwwwww"s
Eww, troll bogey
Ewwwwwwwwwwwww
ewwwwww
Rob schneider's best movie is Surf Ninjas
13hermione is failing her bluff check hard
Shizuka, this is what would happen if they didn't learn that spell. "TROOOOL IN THE DUNGEON!" >fights trolls and dies >movie over
Troll bogey is gross, but the idea of a very VERY young harmonie leading on a troll is okay
inb4 Dteven Spielberg directs a harry potter sequel
Knock out a troll, get five points for your house, catch the snitch, get 150
Biglaw: No. But better than Michael Bay.
13you can see the secret info shining through in his performance
Man, jocks do have everything go easier for them

OtakuTom - actually, going back to that "Pod Race Scene" reference...
evidently someone's made the equivalent of a Star Wars hover-cycle from the forest scene
o.o
MirrorImage: That's called a speeder
sure - that thing
Yea, I've seen speeder bike replicas
:3
haven't seen a star wars movie to completion anyways
OtakuTom - that actually hovers?
MirrorImage: You're joking, right
?
eenope
:O
Hello everypony. :)
are there no faouls or something?
holy shit
Hai Sabershy!
hi Sabershy
why is harry just sitting there watching them get fluffed up
Shizuka - mind if a post a link?
I haven't seen one that hovers on it's own, of course.
finally
13link? :<
13but
13movie
why i'm asking
where did you get this from?
but come on! actually hovering star wars speeder!
MirrorImage: Do want :3
or at least that's the pop culture reference people compare it to
burritos, obviously
wow... that's an old reference

Was anyone else dissapointed that the cloak didn't look like woven quicksilver?
not me unnr
Unnr that in the book or something?
not me either Unnr
HEY-O
I just remember it looking much better in theatres xD
Yeah, that's how it was described to look
Unnr - in all fairness, how many people actually know what "woven quicksilver" is supposed to look like?
What does quickslver look like anyways? Silver?
^ case in point
Barbetos: Mercury
Barbetos: Maybeh
I think
It's silver mercury
13the music here reminds me of doom 3

oh look! Quirrel in a Quarrel
That doesn't happen until at least year 5...he's still 11 right now and probably still believes in cooties :P
*badumtish8
13filch's defining characteristic, irritation at students not sleeping
Good thing this takes place in the 80s? No cell phone for kids back then
Cell phones and wizards...
my god
Barbetos - ...that makes shockling much sense
i always thought of HP as relatively modern - 2000 or so
But it's not!
It may even be the 70s
cell phones give cancer thats what the mbc tells me
In the 6th (yes?) book, it's revealed that Harry was born in like the late 80's
The Ford in the next book kind of gives away the time line
13like 87
fox news tells me that everyone whos a democrat lives in newyork
13the series kicks off in 1998 or so
so then this movie takes place in 98?
Yeah
Yep!
poor kids... growing up on Windows 98
bwahaha
some of them even had to suffer through 95!
I just remember 3.1, hahaha
hey 95 was a great year
Shizuka: And then harry threw a nokia at Voldemort and he was killed, the end
tSparx - as do i
If he was born in 87 he would be 11 around 97.
First year is 1991
When Solitaire was the most complex thing you ever though computers could do
WINDOWS 97! I dunno why I needed to type that...
So 81?
WINDOWS NE!
I got to experience the epicness that was 3.1, then the miserable failure of 95, the slightly better 98, the god-awful 2000 and ME...lol
or something
13really?
OtakuTom - i pity you. i got to skip from 98 to xp
13win2k was their best work
And of course I have no idea what Apple was doing back then >_>
/me prepares the torches and pitchforks for Shizuka
Wiki say Harry was born 31 July, 1980.
13that was horrible
13hands down, no contest, wipe it from history horrible
brb ima see if roblox is still updateing
I never had any good experiences with 2000, but never had it on a PC of my own, so that was probably why.
win98SE was amazingly good... after it was fully patched
13win2k is why XP is so hard to unseat in the enterprise now
I did have a PC with ME..and bloody hell that thing was a huge mess.
13companies waited FOREVER to upgrade to XP from win2k
zAmen haa
13and now from that inertia it's hard to push them to 7
whoa everything is empty i guess rolox is huanted
I watched Toy Soldiers earlier today, and in that movie they show a CRT monitor with IE 5 or something.
Also an advanced military proccessor in that movie had 600 mhz Xd
Shizuka - as i understood it, the general consensus was simply "Vista sucks, don't use it"
and from there, there was roughly 10 years of momentum behind XP
I love how this ties itself in *way* later in the series
Barbatos I have a original Major Chiphazard action figure Barbetos
13vista failed so hard because OEMs didn't keep on top of the drivers fast enough
13nvidia especially
Shizuka: but nvidia has always been bad at keeping on top of drivers
13ja
13but especially for vista's launch
The funny part is, I had a better experience with the beta version of Vista than the official release.
yah
Not to mention that system builders had to deal with the fact that thye had to renew their liscense if they used it so many times iwth vista
13nvidia screwed that up so hard that it blew vista's momentum
Hasbro makes a Sorcerer Stone?
13once the service packs were out vista was pretty rock solid
S3 spoilers?
its roughly the fact that windows makes a big mistake roughly every-other release
Gotta admit, Windows 7 is really incredible. Who would've imagined that OS's could *do* that in just a decade!
then goes and fixes the problems with the next one
tSparx: anyone that uses Linux?
Dead Poet Society is another movie I want to see here
"Oh."
"Well... crap"
I dual-boot Ubuntu, a scratch project I'm working on, and Windows 7
13linux is still most at home in server land
inorder to get in his house just say " we know about the sorcerers stone"
13it's going to take the gaming community and probably a strongly managed distro to unseat windows in the desktop market though
Very, very true, *but*, if you're patient and willing to learn about computers, they're a great daily OS too.
True, but Linux has been great at showing exactly how fast an OS can change
ahaha
13linux changes fast but it also has severe usability issues coming from its unix heritage
and there's the WinME reference
13like single programs being scattered in four different places
13package management is great and all but you shouldn't need that much black box automation
POSIX advantage, everythings a file, but it also is one of the biggest weaknesses
It's great though, because they promise to support old editions of Ubuntu, so if the OS goes a way you don't like, you don't need to worry about it, just wait.
I've used Ubuntu and Mint, really liked both, but had a lot of problems with trying to get compatibility with my different windows-based games, even with WINE.
y no MLP refences?
case in point, the ageing, horribleness that is x11
Malk ikr
13for me and debian at least, i do like that you never need a restart except for kernel upgrades
No one catches the "not the bees"
I want MLP refrences
Mabye it was made before hand
13Malk: this is like 2007
13FIM wasn't a think
Oh yeah, I'll never get *rid* of my Windows partition, because it's the best for gaming. But I wanna switch the day-to-day to Linux this Fall
Malk Peanut-Butter Pony Time (a totally Pinkie line)
13i tried making ubuntu my main on laptop.. it failed miserably..
Linux, like most FOSS software, suffers from a lack of high-end designers
there is a serious lack of well designed, logical User Interface decisions
13more like consistency... it's all POSIX standard but you don't have consistent direction across critical packages for the OS
Yea, dual-boot win/linux would be a good idea. At least Steam is coming to Linux soon...that'll really help the push for more gaming on the platform.
13i remember wrestling for hours trying to get it to accept the wifi card
13and that was before i spent a day and a half trying to get it to admit that, while crappy, the intel integrated chip is in fact 3d acceleration
wifi has come quite a long way in the last year or so
Oh, I'm so excited about that!
All my hardware worked out of the box on Linux Mint when I used it...well...except for the Nvidia card...I really think they need to come out with support for it instead of being asshats about it.
noooo, not unicorn blood!
Unicorn blood looks more like quicksilver
13mint is descended from debian right?
13so far out of the distro families i've tried i like debian the best
Oh it's a repeat.
Mint is derived from Ubuntu, which is derived from Debian, IIRC.
OtakuTom: yep
Debian is nice, because debian is stable
things get really ugly when you start getting into experimental trees, like gentoo
Yea, I've had no issues with Mint or Ubuntu (minus the aformentioned problems trying to get windows games to work)
13if i had another box available i'd try running a desktop linux again
How about ArchLinux?
Wht's with the commentary???
Rifftrax Metronome
13but asuka's not giving up win7 any time soon, and haruko's too small to do more than headless debian
MrEvergreen: they recently moved away from an integrated installation framework, so its not very beginner friendly
Ok
Well they did intend for it to be advanced from the start.
I just wonder how stable it is.
its a nice middle ground if you want to get into a more cutting edge distribution, but don't want the headache of compiling everything
Its still a work in progress
Half Life!
13i tried following a linux from scratch tutorial once... i gave up after gcc took two hours to compile in the vm >>
o_o
2 hours???
Only 2 hours?
13^
How much resources did you allocate for the vm?
13one of the cores and a gig of ram or so
Hmm
13virtualbox was good about it but holy god it was slow
gcc tends to take a while, no matter what
My last experience with VM involved installing it simply to play The Journyman Project again on windows 98.
13^
That's about the place I stopped, but I started back over, taking it slow, taking copious notes, reading every man page.
13i have an xp vm for journeyman project 3
that is on the work pc too =P
wow...The Journeyman Project...thanks for hitting me with a nostalgia bomb :P
Shizuka there is a 3rd one!? WUT!?
I knew there where two...
13i used to have a 98 ISO from MSDN that i vm'd but i think i lost it in a format some years ago
I've only seen gameplay from 1 and 3...lol
The only reason I played the first one is becuase of it being on the packard bell that my dad bought.
13third one is the only one i know cause there was a demo for it on riven cd 4
Yep, I remember the demo from Riven
heh packard bell
13managed to track down a torrent earlier this year and ran it, great game
Good Old Games has both Journeyman Project 2 and 3 available
I haz msn browser
How did I miss that on gog
for sale, and gog release include pre-configured vm environments to make it easy
DAMNIT!
Why is there a ghost in her room?
There is a ghost in her class room
wtf?
Each house has a ghost or two.
gog also has the longest journey <3
They're just part of the castle.
Yea, but TLJ still actually works on Win7 :P
00,02i remember watching this on my 12th birthday
13the problem with them shortening the puzzle section of this movie is you miss the proof that snape is helping guard the stone with a potions puzzle
00,02^
I completely forgot about the potions puzzle...I haven't read the book in a looooong time.
Phase4 my older sister watched Titanic on her birthday. Ah memories.
No way, gog has phantasmagoria
*squeeeee*
00,02Barbetos, odd film choice
Honestly, Joshihollywood (de Tumblr) said it best: these movies are highlight reels of the books.
It came out around her birthday, and it had a convincing enough advertising campaing I guess
00,02this movie alone is good imho
and then Neville Longbottom was scared for life
00,02it only breaks down when you bring continuity into it
Well, *yeah*, that's not a small deal, hahaha
00,02thats what happens when you start making movies while the series is being written
Oh, well yeah, they don't do things quite right because they don't know what it links up to in the future
00,02though tbh things did kinda just 'appear' in the last book
run
into the hole
naw
Phase4: you mean Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machinas?
nao
00,02Unnr, eyup
lol
00,02doesnt ruin it, still a good series
00,02just a bit sudden
^
I still need to read book 7...
ALL the fishing bait!
^^das Ding^^
00,02OtakuTom, do read it
00,02worth it
Phase4 just the idea of Rowling dancing to "I'm in the money" mean anything to you? XD
If so take this pamplet.
00,02how much did rowling make?
00,02i imagine it was a big number
Enough to not have to continue after book 7
Which will come when she needs more
So wait, its like the last choice of Mass Effect 3, suddenly appears, is a bit silly in context, but still doesn't manage to kill the series as pretty awesome?
Though isn't she planning on doing some? Just more slowly, low-scale
Unnr: Ecactly
00,02Unnr, i've not played that game but its different afaik
Exactly*
Phase4: as of 3/11 JKR is worth roughly 1 billion USD

Stupid reference that I only understand, sorry in advance =P

Ron should of done everyone a favor and sacrificed himself at that part.
Malk (\
13i'm still convinced
13there's way more than enough room for them to just go around the board
00,02^
lol ^
agreed, shizu
but MAAGGGIIICCC
00,02i did always wonder that
Lol, I think in the book they make it clear that the chamber is small, and there are grates and stuff.
ANd the PLOT demands it!
Or you know, go back a room, steal the brooms and fly over
But its fun to play giant magic chess Shizuka
00,02just have them jump off the board or put a fire pit there
00,02the pieces that is
What, no Iron Maiden?
Why is ron good at chess makes no sense
And despite all those things their 11 year old minds decided to play the game. DOn't break the rules kids.
It was a fun game amongst his siblings.
13IT'S ALL ABOUT THE GAME
13AND HOW YOU PLAY IT
Is it bad that all I can think when the queen approaches Ron on his Knight is "Hm. Yes. Quite."
Hermione didn't get too many chess games in her childhood, even in the United Kingdom. But Ron got whooped by Fred & George etc. a million times
I've always wanted to get 32 people together to play a full game of human chess...lol
YOU BROKE THE RULES
00,02XD
00,02and then rifftrax mentions the path
13why is he suddenly bloody
OtakuTom - BronyCon?

00,02his hand causes the stone thing
00,02but his throat doesnt?
This is like the ending of Who Framed Roger Rabbit
Mmm, reboot. *hugs their copy of the art of reboot*
Barbetos: You :P
Nah. I wish.
Ash
00,02Do ho ho
:D
13there's the xmen riff i mentioned earlier
I would love to be able to say I invented a meme, no matter how small
Malk - yeah, and either Cadence is a Knight as well, or she's the bishop on the same side as Armor
in which case, Twilight is the other bishop by default
Like I said way earlier tonight, I am easy.
00,02rifftrax doesnt work as well on good movies
I watched the whole series 'round this time last year, and then .hack//sign afterward
and spike as that Knight?
Wait I just realised... why does the bottom say "The Sorcerer's Stone"? Isn't it philiospher's stone?
MirrorImage: Word
which leaves the question of the Rooks... Dash and AJ?
13AdamTheDuck: it was "sorceror's stone" in the US because alchemy wasn't really a thing over here
AJ
13so "philosopher" doesn't mean "alchemist"
He touched me there officer Shizuka
00,02see shizu's answer
Cause that's what most call it here
I see...
(Instert TF2 to meme Seeman here with him saying (SEE?!?!)) :p
Mornin' everyone

K-Celestia; Q-Luna; Kn-Armor/Spike; Bi-Cadence/Twilight; Rook-Dash/AJ; Pawns-Royal Guards/Negasi
The sad part was that I was awake when you went to bed, and I am still awake Chrysalis =P
/me Points at the chat "SI!?!"
13SI
Barbetos i used to do that ALOT
but now i have to pack to move :(
it's the Discord/Chrysalis side that'd cause problems...
itsonly 12 am here
00,02the problem with 'every flavor beans' is that there are a lot of flavors, many of them very similar, most of them shit
I vote Manticores for the Rooks, but i'm a little stumped as to Knights and Bishops
Me and my silliness :P
Nameless Pony #47
Salve
Chrysalis A new place eh? Sounds liek fun. =D
Barbetos I'm moving to manchester
Mmm, vindaloo flavoured beans
so at least BUCK next year will be awesome
Mirrorimage I think Buffalo should be rooks mabye
tSparx: NOPE! This is the nickname I have sticked with since I first started coming here ^^
Malk - not for Discord/Changeling
not for "Evil"
I know, the default would be Pony47, yes?
MirrorImage im talking good
love clap
sounds rude
13412 points now
slow clap!
BUCK looks and sounds like it was so much fun. Not to mention getting to meet some other bronystaters. I wish I could of gone so much. =( But I do not make enough money to up and fly there. =\
13472
Then 1 point.
00,02472 points?
tSparx: The default would be pony_4772 or somthing like that. Besides I like my nick name! It's shor and sweet to the point! ^^
10 points
I mean
*short
I wish I could fly out of MO, or drive across via ferry, to Britain. But I can't :/
13nah slytherin was 472
Ponies47: Yeah yeah, it really is you ;)
13so they tied and overtook
re-killing voldemort, 60 points, catching the snitch, 150 points, so broken
MirrorImage zecora should be bishop
00,02dem faces
tSparx: ;)
Malk - if we assume a third team, sure
00,02they need to put the sorting hat in tf2
3 houses celebrate when one wins
00,02and it should speak
Phase4 YES!
but Celestia/Luna really should encompass Mane cast, with the exception of the pawns
what was hagrid in? Griffondor? Was it ever said ?
I've always thought I'd love to sit in a room talking quietly with the Sorting Hat
ALL of my yes
Phase4|2: OMGYES
13Chrysalis: especially because hufflepuff was now last place
Im going to put some jack daniels in that cup and drink it
00,02Dismo, why you ping Phase4|2 ?
13[02:11] [+Phase4] they need to put the sorting hat in tf2
13hmm difficult
13very difficult
MirrorImage: Yeah, we need multiple sets.
00,02Dismo, might want to refresh your client
13you have energy yes
Speaking of TF2. I found some really awesome Gmod videos that I ahve never seen streamed here before. IThey are funny :P
13but you like attacking
13i know where i'll put you...
*have
13BLU TEAM
00,02Shizuka, XD
RED TEAM
damnit shizuy
MirrorImage I Think it would be nice if Zecora was there as bishop though
13actually
Phase4: There, all better.
13they have a sorting hat
lol Wouldn't it pick a class instead?
13and it's just as unfair and biased
00,02they do?
13it's called autobalance
Zecora is a queen, really
Shizuka: Oh you! XD
00,02ah
Shizuka they need to nerf the autobalance
Queen of the Evergreen
Shizuka: zing
whos queen tsparx
so you dont get moved as a team is about to lose
00,02in theory i like servers with class limits
Zacora, the Zebra!
00,02in practice, the crap players steal the spots
i really wish more servers ran without random crits
She's the only consistently good thing to live out in the Everfree Forest
00,02and you end up with two tumors on your team
I wish TF2 would introduce modes for teams GRN and YLO. TFC had an AWESOME flag hold map with all four teams
00,02Chrysalis, i dont, random crits throw a bit of chance into the game
Dat Hogwarts Express :P
00,02to each their own i supose
yeah, but never on my side
00,02XD
its everyone else that gets them
Phase4 I wish they had team FFAs in TF2
Chrysalis - attack more
get more crits
I would play GRN pyro all the time.
Alright, stepping away to grab food or whatever, prolly be back later.
00,02BUILDING A SENTRY
Just saying.
Shizuka: Were you autherized to use it? >:C
WHAT IS LOVE?!
13>>
13<<
13yes
MirrorImage sentries doont get random crits
13maybe
Okies everyone
Engineer!
medics dont get crit heals
13WHAT'S THE RIGHT ANSWER ><
time to pretend to get a few hours of sleep
Shizuka: Mu.
Keep saying answers and you will be right eventually.
00,02Chrysalis, if you remove random crits then those weapons with no random crits as a drawback become op
00,02not by much but they do
I LIVE IN TEXAS AND AM A ENGINEER DOES THAT MAKE ME ENGIE?
Seriously, when in doubt Mu/Wu, best answer ever
My arrrrrrrm!
This video came out befoer the game release IIRC which is why you never hear the "MY ARRRMMM!!" death sound in game.
THE WOMAN! SHE'S BROKEN THE LAW!
00,02Major, POOTIS SPENCER HERE
POOTIS POOTIS POOTIS!
Phase4 - Pootis POW!
^
13one of these days
Oooh, that trackmania forever screen
13they really need to bring the nailgun back
Now. The real question is, who was recorded saying that?
Nailgun was a quake thing though.
Shizuka: Nail gun? O.O
00,02Building a nailgun
Or.. Gldsrc if you want to get technical
00,02Shizuka, from tf clasic right?
or.. even IDtech2
13but they just have to bring it back
or wahtever
13it was there in tf2 beta also
00,02ah
13you can see it in the original trailer and at the end of meet the heavy's lineup
00,02as a weapon or sentry?
13scoot weapon
13not sure if the scattergun or pistol replaced it
OH yeah I remember
00,02i'm guessing the pistol
o/ bai all
00,02later Unnr
Did you ever play around with the original tf2 assests that shipped with Episode 1 Shizu?

Your welcome
Meh, I'll never like Minecraft
You know I think I may suffer from Narcism
Or from narcissism
Derpy123 thats ok I think im a maniac and I like to dress up as a bear in the park and scare people
Lol. Yo sound like your the toast of the town.
Malk, thats just funny
you
YOLO
POLO
Ponies only Live Once
You think im kidding right?
no I don't.
I've heard crazier stories.
And for fun I say hi to children and I offer candy to peoples kids and say im testing them
So your a pedo furry then?
:D
http://cheezburger.com/6487807232
...
Derpy123 I dont touch kids
>_>
I test them only to see how their parents react
its crazy funny
That day I awoke from my bed, I heard unknown voices screaminng:"LIIIFE'S INSAAAANE!"
Alright everypony! I think I am going to bed.
Night
WHy would you scar kids, wth
See you Sabershy
Thank you for the stream Shizuka and thanks for the current stream SuperBrony64. :)

I dont scare them I offer candy far from the truth Derpy123
Oh I misunderstood.
and I really give it to them
god Im not a pedo
I'm well on my way to owning my own house!
I just like to confuse people and make them think things and watch reactions
Awesome OtakuTom

Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story Updates August 22nd (Morning)
Eh...more fanfics.
I hardly read them.
Do you see anything wrong with that Derpy123/
?
Of course, now I'm at the point where I have to wait for the bank to respond, since it's a short sale x_x
Derpy123: Twilight is not amused :P
What? What's wrong?
Me giving candy to kids to see peoples reactions
Derpy123: You're a poet and you don't even know it?
Uh find it weird but generous, why?
11,02Fuuuu...forgot I was in Creative Mode >>
SuperBrony64: YOU SILLY
Derpy123 you wouldnt believe the looks and words I get from peoples parents
AdamThePato, I am not a poet.
11,02Dismo: Moo O.O
yay superbrony is streaming
Malk, I would find it strange too.
Yay I'm a pato now
LMAO> Yes you are. :)
Derpy123 one woman threaten to call the police and I said what are you going to say I offered your child candy?
Well kidnappers usually dress up in a disguise to lure kids in to their homes and offer them candy, so no I don't know why they would think of calling the cops, Malk. :/
I dont really do that anymore thought because now it is pretty bad for me to do it
Bear costume is my thing now
lolwut :D ^
Well it is a nice jester true, but out of the ordinary which may make people be suspicous.
I wear a bear costume and scare adults
AdamTheDuck, and he gives little kids candy while doing so.
Derpy123 no not at the same time
...ok
Aww, that would be funny...
I would just be at the park normal and offer kids candy
Ever get chased by the popo?
and I seperatly wear costume and scare people in park
Derpy123 nope they dont really care
Lol still not as bad as my friend who put "Able to give out candy to people" on his resume
Wuut. Lol.
He works at Kmart and because there's a jar of lollies
Everyone in the area pretty much knows its me when I do it so they dont mind
he makes sure everyone who passes by take at least one
Its kind of like at a point where no one cares eccept people not from around my area
Dem minecarts
usually I scare other people I know
11,02So yeah...not going to do this trial >>
i don't blame you
11,02So hard ><
SuperBrony64: "OH COME ON!"
Trial?
it's not finished either

He keeps asking me for toilet paper...
hi everypony
He calls hmself Cornholio.
o.o
Sumica: oh my
lol
Hi Seatsea
That
wat :<
Huh
Hi there ;)
Weird
Some one does not know what the slang "Granny" means
WOAH
Sumica: Oh Alabama jokes
WOAHWOAHWOAH
Sumica, I read that when Veggie posted it. I LOL'd hard.
"Dash X Pink..."
OH GOD IT'S NOT... that one... IS IT!?
The Fic Which Must Not Be Named?
What?
is steam down?
(.........that's not cupcakes in that folder, is it? blurgh.......)
??
Where did you find that particular peice of interesting literature Sumica?
00,10the intertubes
00,10it was linked to me
tSparx: more likely shipping pics :D
It's a fanfiction about cannabalism. It was honestly one of the first things I heard about the Brony movement. Disturbing :/
Can I request a vid?
Barbetos stream down?
Yeah
MadSurge: God I hope so heh heh
tSparx: you're talking cupcakes and no, it's not a forbidden word
you think I should post the project Barbetos?
Sure why not?
SuperBrony64 isn't a Cupcakes guy :D
No, it makes me hiss just to see the word! Nah, but seriously, gives me the heeby-jeebies
or do you think they can wait for the fun?
also, everybody knows it. hell, there was a time when reading it was almost viewed as a rite of passage into the herd
Malk in between streams is the best time to put it up honestly
What are you talking about? SuperBrony64 LOVES Cupcakes!
Dark_Horst: well I never did, am I not a brony then? :D
That would've been... I would've looked straight past Pinkie and Rarity and co., and said, "Nope, not doing this. Nope!"
Cupcakes... so sweet and tastey...
MadSurge: HEATHEN! IMPOSTOR!
< never read cupcakes
How long has the stream been off?
I might have to fix that though
< Will never read cupcakes
don't read it
DO IT
READ IT
DO IT, YOU WIMP!
NAO
Special If you dont like spoilers to a new parody im doing dont click if you want to see first draft and comment feel free
It's the same thing, sorta, as that horrid 2girls1cup thing a few years ago.
I don't succumb that easy to peer pressure guys.
http://meetingwords.com/49Vfxuyaqo
Real life cupcakes :Q
I've already unwittingly read some clop fics. I started them and could not stop. Morbid curiousity I suppose
tSparx: actually that'S bullshit
I am already scared enough. Cupcakes can be that much worse
I give Cupcakes a 1.1/10 rating on fimfiction.net
Dark_Horst: I'm not looking down on anybody who enjoys it. That's their thing, though; it gives me the creeps.
comparing it to 2girls1cup is still bullshot
I lump it all together in the "Things I don't want to see ever" folder of my brain
That's how they're similar, that's all I meant :.
:/*
tSparx I have a milk crate for that.
Barbetos: you must've read the wrong ones
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4RyXvd0kjE&feature=g-vrec i like this this is nice
tSparx: they're not similar
not even remotely
Oh thanks Barbetos :) I needed a joke, that was getting dark.
Barbetos slim, from Futurama
I'M NOT SAYING THEY ARE
I'm saying I don't wanna see either.
you just did
That's how they're similar from my point of view.
MASF123 I actually did not get this user name from that.
Was from the PoTC stream?
11,02Sorry about that, computer got blue screened :<
nah that neither. I got it as a suggestion when I was trying to name my Night Elf Rogue, it just stuck after that.
awww...
damn it SuperBrony64, you had one job!
11,02:<
But at least it's gone, that's all that matters.
Yeah...true.
SB64 thats not a normal thing is it?
11,02No >>
I get blue screen commonly, it is because of lack of memory.
for me I mean.
Depends on what the error is MASF123
Probably not though
If it where a memory issue your computer probably would not boot at all
11,02I have 8 GB of Memory
Hmm...he's setting stuff up I see
11,02Sorry, I mean I have 1 TB of Memory
11,02:>
i must be the last guy on the planet who still has only 4GB
Is there a schedule of which mod streams at what time?
8gb on laptop, 12 on desktop
SB64 I want yur ram and mobo
I have 6GB on my labtop
12 is a strange number.
11,02My CPU is a Lenovo and it runs at 8 Ghz.
1 Terrabyte? Lucky fuck
upgrading to 8
Actually I have 14, so I can't be one to speak
11,02...My troll failed >>
You think >.>
Oh. Don't sell yourself short.
I was almost this close to looking up if a proc could do that on a laptop, untill you said something
and by this close imagine a small space between my thumb and finger.
SuperBrony64 maybe you should of been less obvious
11,02Maybe you should give me a hug :I
/me glomps SuperBrony64

Maybe you should.
/me hugs SuperBrony64 :P
11,02Barbetos: Good :D Cause I'm a pony ^-^
Is making a Barbie Girl pony parody a bad Idea?
/me hugs AdamTheDuck back ^-^
Malk yes, burn that idea with fire
I want to punch someone!
11,02Is making a fanfiction crossing between MLP and Thomas the Tank Engine bad?
No.
No
>.>
No it is not.
Did you read what he posted though MASF123?
Dem responses.
Because Tom is best boulder train
11,02What if it was a clopfiction?
Im working on it right now so MASF123 I cant burn it its in my labtop
SuperBrony64: fire up the notpad
What is going around your mind SuperBrony64 x_x
SuperBrony64: Whaaaa....?
Nothing. :D
Sorry...That was rude of me.

SuperBrony64 read us a fanfic on stream
Scootaloo and the Caboose?
I am on a mission because for some reason someone told me I should Make a parody of it so I will
She just shamelessly falls in love with a Caboose.
Like the cart.
Or he can read us the story of the Ugly Barnacle. :3
and then thomas used his mighty piston
Shamelessly in love with you Ill do anything you want me to Barbetos
ANYTHING
11,02What about a cross between Dora the Explorer and MLP?
Oh no
well, it could be grimdark
MLP should cross with Slenderman
And make it a drama
11,02With a guest appearance by Blue's Clues and PB and J Otter.

Malk I am not that loveable. Trust me. I am really abrasive in RL =P
Ooh I remember Ruby Gloom!
MLP crossover with Transformers?
I was singing a song Barbetos
SuperBrony64 knowing this fandom, it will be done at some point.
What I said still applies
SuperBrony64: :D I barely know any of those kids' shows
00,02ah, was wondering where stream went
Buy some apples!
AdamTheDuck: I just watched it. Like, I'm a grown man, and I saw it for the first time 3 weeks ago. It was a blast :D

DJ Hero
thank the 9 divines that its DJ Hero
I gots this game :D
I played it.
bad part is im at huge risk to go to sleep
11,02Got this game new with the controller for $15 from Toys R Us o.o
Its actually a pretty good game
SuperBrony64 i got it about the same price
Wii / XBOX?
DJ Hero was a good idea and overall a good game, but I still think some of the execution was a little off, and kinda did in the whole "Hero" series.
SuperBrony64, Play Pajanoo with Shout! Plz.
It did so bad
Yeah it did
oh wii
lame
could of joined if it was the xbox version
OtakuTom i think it should be noted that the arcade counter parts, the ones that had nothing to do with the Hero series, had a pretty big underground following from what I saw
Im going tot go ahead and say good night in advance because I think ill go to sleep soon so good night everypony
Beatmania? Yea, Konami still knocks each iteration of it out of the park.
Goddamn it MIPS.

I'm in the mood to kill some people.
Twisted Metal Black or the newer one?
TWISTED METAL :3
Newer one
Yeah. Did not play that one. Planned on getting it but never did
I just want my darksouls pc already
11,02I have no clue how to play this game o.o
Jump right in
Its not that hard
its actually a little fun
Oh god this game
The pain in my hands after playing for a whole day straight
T'was fun though.
lol
gazukazuka it!
zug zug
Yeah. WERD!
SuperBrony64 its not that hard, but the tutorial is really badly organised
it goes through features that dont appear until hard/expert
before finishing all the normal ones
So now you have a curvy road
It almost sounds like the tutorial guy does not know what he is talking about
"If I keep saying it is simple it will wall work out"
'nother one down
lazers
11,02This game is easy :D
this is just the beginning
So when does the game simulate the neighbors coming over and telling yoy to turn it down
Playing at that type of speed is murder.
TOO SLOW.
SuperBrony64 wait till you play a couple of song
SuperBrony64, you should play a song from the scratch perverts
or daft punk
Daft Punk <3
jmo IKR
I'd take them over todays generation anyday.
One More Time
Technologic
Around The World
also the scratch perverts are easy technically
Da Funk
and are much more of an endurance song
Wish I could of gone to Alive 2007 ;~;
Stop! Shout!
Let it all out Let it all out Let it all out.....
Arount the World we gooo...Around the World we gooo...
ded
Like my life purpose
11,02Now I know how it feels to be Vinyl Scratch :D
She uses magic
:D
SuperBrony64 just wait
:D
youll feel BADASS by the end of the tutorial
SuperBrony64: If you have a PS2, try to find Beatmania.
then get knocked back when you try a song
Another one bites the dust
Dust Dust Dust
what is this dj hero?
Yeah
11,02OtakuTom: Okie :3
Left, Up, Down, Right
these dont appear on anything below hard
Ooooh don't lose it SuperBrony64
11,02I feel like putting the middle of my fingers on the button instead of the tips is easier >>
Your the DJ
and these also dont appear on anything below hard
Only nubs play under hard of course
MASF123 yeah
this games a BITCH on hard
theres a massive jump
Yea, the ramp up in difficulty is crazy.
main problem of DJ Hero is that Easy, Normal is easy, but hard is normal and Expert is hard modes.
thats one way of putting it
they needed to make normal harder
EXCELLENT
these are a nightmare
and only appear on expert
Slide left right
SuperBrony64
dis song
11,02Huh MASF123?
PRE'E SLICK MANG
Oh hell no
here we go
that demo in the background
looks
hard
Rewind
oh look
and back to easy/normal features
also, because you cant see it
aaaaand im off the pc.
the button actually glows on the controller
when euphoria is ready
Ye-aah Y- ahhhhh
unlike guitar hero, euphoria can be used after one sequence and you can hold up to 3
unlike guitar hero which activates after 2 and holds 4
Lol. You can't fail at DJ Hero too.
Song goes on even if you mess up.
11,02Too bad this controller can't double as a record player...
MASF123 yeah that REALLY bugs me about this game
you cannot fail
The audience likes whatever you dish out even if it's crap.
indeed
must be how biber gets so popular
yuuuup
everyone is actually a dj hero player
pretty much
heh, SuperBrony64 just did what always gets me, leaving the slider
oooh
:/
11,02Leaving the slider? o.o
haha
SuperBrony64 yeah you left the crossfader in the wrong position
my cousins had this game
always gets me after a rewind
wammy
oh man these wammys get you SO MANY points
doubles your score, and adds to it for as long as your still rotating the effects knob
SuperBrony64, just pretend your giving a nipple twister
MASF123 thats a wierd ass nipple twister
Your not helping
Dat spam
YEEAAAH BOIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIii

But true, he probably neer used a turn table.

MASF123: that would be the soundtrack if radios ran the show :D
00,02SuperBrony64, thats ok, theres room in the world for both ^_^
11,02Here
MASF123: rainbow dash has orange in her hair, she is ginger. she has a soul
i like ponies and ratchet and clank if they had a hybrid of the 2 my life would be compleat
SuperBrony64, Y must you crush my hopes and dreams!

00,02i'm the bess?
a capella
00,02like a bess?
Acapella Soulja Boi?

But if you sing about it, you failed
00,02i like how much effort they put into pegasi wings
what has happend here is someone put there hand on a live wire and gained the knowlege of all
00,02animation is really fluid
MASF123: i said: i dont care anymore, you can go on with hating gingers, and i will tolerate your ignorance. simple

Dramatic death muic
DaringDerpy: according to the toaster in big mountain, a heating element is nothing else than a death ray with a smaller power supply. just grab one and connect it to the reactor

00,02still makkon
Phase4: that's better :D
00,02spinning this rocket takes a while
00,02also this is the first launch that didnt explode
00,02will totaly make the mun
00,02night SuperBrony64|Zzz
11,02Night all, have fun Phase4 :3
Goodnight SuperBrony64|Zzz
G'Night SuperBrony64|Zzz sleep well
00,02i will ^_^
Night SuperBrony64|Zzz :)
Hey ponies, I'm back
yet I must make TOAST
Welcome back Serenity
00,02now
00,02this version doesnt show transfer thingys
00,02the orange thing when you enter another bodys gravity
00,02so this will be pure luck
good luck Phase4
Yay pure luck is best gamble
screw educated guesses
00,02THAT
00,02now that was awesome
Strangly the music fits very well o.o
god damn Phase4
did you hit orbit of the moon from that
00,02^_^
Dat Pinkie :D
Looks like it
00,02i'm in orbit
00,02about ready to land
/me applauds
00,02but first
00,02have to wee
music fit very well
Of course you do.
But first! BUUUUUT FIIIIIIIIRRRRRRSSSSSTTTTTT... I gotta take a wheeze!
00,02hmmm
00,02gona wait for a luna day
well i am going to be awayfor a few hours. bye
00,02imagine beeing these guys
00,02'sorry, you'll need to wait a month or so'
00,02'cant see where to land otherwise'
dat feel
Phase4: they'd probably go all Party of One :D
00,02XD
Fitting music is once again fitting :3
00,02remember
00,02i have no landing gear
Pfft, who needs landing gear when you can crash
Sudden music change is also very fitting o.o
00,02i've hacked together some wings
00,02tested them on kerbin
00,02can land on them
silly phase, kerbals dont land, they explode controlled
00,02also i have no idea if the ground is at the same level
00,02quiet in here
anticipating
Yup
00,02hmmm
00,02cant slow that fast
00,02powerfull rocket
00,02heavy lander
00,02if this doesnt explode i'ma be amazed
Mah fookin' interent connecshun dedded :/
00,02dat feel
/me wonders who Serenity is writing that comment with no internet connection :P
how*
*yay*
AdamTheDuck: IM
00,02where is the ground
Below yoyu
00,02:<
down there
Dat Avast Octavia's Ass
00,02usint a lot more fuel than i want to
But you're usin' fuel for science, so it's alright :P
Love how badly textured the mun is
00,02starting to see ground texture
00,02its close
Lucky. I've never even managed to reach Mun yet.
00,02i've done it many times :P
Phase4: What is the song i'm hearing? sounds a bit familiar
I've only managed it once
I was about to land
00,02http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xcKACtKLnA&feature=autoplay&list=UUmMWwYyeQlZzbeynRJwCSGg&playnext=14
Then my fucking parachute fails and I die
00,02landings are the hard bit
00,02you cant parachute on the mun :P
00,02no air
Ahh, so that's why it failed
00,02XD
00,02have to do controled descents like this one
from descrption
thats why it sounds familiar
I've managed to rocket landings on Kerbal so I think I could land on Mun. But it's getting there. I tend to over or undershoot it every time.
Dark_Horst: Yeah had a strange feeling it was like Rainbow Factory
00,02i'm happy i spent the weight and got the sas
Horyshreet! KSP!
00,02this would be near imposible without
Also hi :D
05oh Iran banned Battle.net IPs todayu
Phase4: It was worth the weight - GabeN
05bring out the proxies!
Olol
00,02Wrek, odd, why?
00,02Serenity, XD
Wrek: iran?
Canards? For landing on the moon Phase4 ?
Wrek that seems odd, any idea why
00,02Chrysalis, yeah
00,02derp
00,02Golakka, yeah
Funny that parachutes don't work, but winglets do.
Do they actually work on the moon?
00,02winglets dont work
051 sec
00,02i'm using them as landing gear
BAD IDEA!
051. Promotion of superstition and mythology
052. Promotion of violence due to too much violence (I'm not exaggerating this is exactly what they wrote).
053. Abolishing the deformation in sin.
054. Demonstration of inappropriate clothing and slutty outfits for female avatars.
Then what is your ASAS controlling?
You have GOT to come on soft Phase4 or you are boned
like, <2ms
00,02Wrek, huh
Lol that 4th reason
wrek what was that from?
Wrek: Yeah, I noticed Blizzard get Slutty with females :/
what is iran anyway?
It's a country
Next to Iraw
Iraq*
oh THAT iran
00,02close
00,02getting close
00,02very close
Remember, 10% throttle does not burn 90% less fuel in KSP now
i thought this was about some website xD
it burns 900% less :D
Due to a glitch in the code
00,02wont need much fuel to get home
10% throttle doesnt use 10% fuel drain
00,02still using more than i want to
it uses 1%
You should get mechanical jeb, if it still works
<.<
Do airbreathing engines still work in space?
sure
why not
They used to...
00,02nope
00,02njot in new versions
Thank god for that!
From what I know of ASAS is that it controls normal SAS, winglets and gimbals, but doesn't do anything itself.
That was just idiocy, Flying the the mun on scramjets
So I wonder what it's doing here.
slower!!!
thats good :D
stay near 1ms with winglet gears
I mean, I see no normal sas or gimbals, and the winglets don't work on Mun.
00,02FSCK YEAH
this looks manual
SUCCES!
FSCK?
nice!
touchdown
Nice :3
A round of aplause for Phase4
00,02i was manually piloting it
NOW DO AN EVA!!!
00,02using sas for stability
00,02cant eva :P
00,02demo version
Appropriate music!
Omg
daww
05ok so
00,02i've got the full version but wanted to try demo landing
Night gentlemen.
05it was announced on the news in Iran
So, what do you do on Mun with Demo?
05those were the reasons posted
00,02Serenity, nothing
You did all this on the DEMO version?
05someonem with internet access relayed it
Goodnight XAXzzz
00,02yeah
Amazing.
00,02Wrek, interesting
Wrek: Hey, welcome to hell. This world is buggered up.
Wrek: Lol'd at the second reason.
00,02i'll take a look at that after returning
The music fits so, so well.
00,02HOME TIME
Tbh, Im more of a spaceplane guy than a rocketeer
so yeah, if you bought anything from blizzard down there, you're fuckt now. except you know how to proxy
I still havent achived a stable orbit with a vertical launched rocket
Nice camera angle!
Proxy servers aren't THAT hard to set up
00,02getting close to not enough fuel
If the schools can do it, anyone can do it ;)
Dark_Horst: need to l2proxy
However I have been to the mun many times, Once to minmus with an airbreathing SSTO
i doubt he has the fuel to make it back
inb4 stuck in space
Use as little throttle as you can to accelerate
Isn't he going in the wrong direction?
yay for moon gravity
you will use disproportionatly less fuel
Oh, I know what he's doing
Is he using the orbit to get momentum?
Is he going to slingshot around the sun?
Nyst: aiming for orbit entry
hot damn
nice one phase
Nyst: see? there
Then once the momentum is done, he buggers off to home
Clever bastard Phase4 , nbice music aswell
Huh, how did he do that?
Magic :D
Nyst: steer
this is a geocentric based game by looking at this
05using proxy is probably punishable by X
00,02turn aroudn mid flight
Quite a bit of luck aswell
05besides
00,02have enough fuel to land in the sunlight so why not
05if you have an blizz authenticator the rapid IP changes will lock your account
00,02SURPRISE PLANNET
Hmm, that sucks
where did that come from?
ooo gettin fancy
Oh god
wait, Iran banned battle.net shit?
The G this is gonna be
That's a pretty early disconnect.
00,02Serenity, kerbals survive infinite g
Buytoast: they did
05Buytoast yeh
ahahaha
Phase4: I know that, considering I went 36g at one point
yes, but do parachutes?
00,02Serenity, i once hit 50 :P
05anyoen here read arabic?
00,02PsychoticDoc, somehow yeah
lol
05well i think its arabic but meh
Wrek: Google translate is your friend
so many times my parachute got ripped off of my rocket trying to land or whatever
05dont trust google translate
It may be innacurate, but at least it gives you the basic idea
Yeah but how do you type the arabic into the translator? :p
05i know how easely it fucks up anything that isnt english
Just copy and paste
05besides its from an image
05and not text
Ahh
I wish they put re-entry plasma into KSP :D
Wrek: i must ask you something. if i supplied you with a base pony, could you make a desktop pony for me?
That would look awesome
The might do so eventually
Flyboy: all you would need to do is animate it
oops
Parachute, NOW.
Nah, too high
that was to myslef 0.0
00,02you can wait a bit
Right now you can land an eva'd kerbal without him burning up
00,02let the speed drop
05Flyboy nope, cause i dont make desktop ponies
Wrek: who does then?
True Nyst
I've opened my parachutes as low as 400m and survived.
Pretty sure Vordox knows how.
05cause http://i47.tinypic.com/2lktnqx.jpg
tis the end of the flight of the the U.S.S. Dico
Hahaha
Did...the parachute just explode?
Disco*
was that supposed to explode?
Nyst: Yes
Rawhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiidddddddddddddddddddeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee~
Exploding parachute, lawl
00,02Nyst, eyup
Hah, those crazy Kerbals.
Explosives in everything.
00,02der we go
00,02dats my rocket
pretty
00,02i like it
Needs moar thrusters
00,02especially during take of
hai everypony :3
I played the hell out of the demo.
00,02the upper solids burn three of the lowwer ones off
So does anyone know how to make a desktop pony? i dont have the means to do it :(
Hello Spell-of-Gaming
Well guys, yet again i must walk to school, see you all around later today
I bought the full game a little while ago, but there's so many new parts that I don't understand yet.
PsychoticDoc: bye
00,02Flyboy, just normal gif files and some stuff
Bye PsychoticDoc
Bahhh
00,02Nyst, they're quite easy to use, most of them are the same as other stuff or plane parts
Phase4: i cant do it myself so i need someone who has experience to do it for me.
I made a gif of Soldiers Colourful adventure
maby you can make a desktop pony in cs4 flash
You can't
Well yeah, it's just that I can't tell the difference yet.
Flash works on vector imaging
aw
Is one capsule better then the other? No idea.
00,02Nyst, ones bigger
00,02for the bigger parts
00,02i like dis rocket
00,02gona have to try it again some time
00,02hmmm
00,02more ksp or different game
00,02different game
Each row needing to take me past one layer.
00,02i've never managed solid fuel
00,02well
00,02i did once
Solid fuel is a bitch
powerful though.
Powerful and heavy
00,02incredibly usefull
00,02just not so easy
And a bitch to balance the weight power ratio
It leaves lots of liquid fuel for actual space travel and maneuvres.
00,02not beyond boost on takeoff though
00,02Nyst, how bout this rocket
00,02it'll load in a minute
I want a better laptop q.q
Yeah after you leave the athmosphere they're not very useful. Still I tend to keep at least one in space for emergencies.
And fun.
00,02the one solid rocket design i've made that works
Serenity: did you say vordox knows how to make desktop ponies before?
00,02lets try it
That looks interesting.
Flyboy: I can't confirm it, but I'm sure he knows a thing or 2 about it
It must create so much drag!
Hi :P
Serenity: ima see if he can make one for me
Derp my ass off derp :P
Hello Rain_Down_On_Me
whn he get online -.-
Anyone here who can keep a secret? :P
thnx :)
Me hehehe
Spell-of-Gaming: Never trust the internet
Spell-of-Gaming: Well it isn't a secret unless only one person knows :3

NOT TRUE
Huh, surprisingly stable
WHEN IS IT GONNA START?
Ello there every- oh damn Phase, what are you doing? D:
pretty!
Rocket explosion
Hello Malavolent
Phase4 that was awesome
:P
Phase4: Ever made it to Murz yet?
I WANNA DERP
00,02no murz
:P
Not sure what the canon name is
00,02wish there was one
Phase4: do you use a joystick?
Phase4: Pretty sure they added Mars
00,02Nyst, dont have one
:|
00,02Serenity, the have minmus but its another moon
Ahhh, okay
A green moon :)
00,02only one body orbiting the sun
Can someone tell me why trixie is so popular :?
00,02its easy to get to minmus
00,02anything mun capable can probably do minmus
WHEN IS IT GOTING TO FUCKING START?
Rain_Down_On_Me: Because it's Meanwhile's favourite character :3
Rain_Down_On_Me: the owner of eqd, the central brony blog, is a huge trixie fan
NIGGA STOLE MY NAME
I hope more planets get added soon. Murs, Kobos and Keimos, Maturn and rings maybe?
NIGGA STOLE MY NAME!
Fuc eqd
*fuck
Kluto.
Go get your own name >:3
not that keen on trixie. she made the mane 6 look bad. well... most of them...
G'morning Bronystate
00,02howzat
Mornin'
Good morrow Gold_Demona
00,02orbit with nothing but solids
is this one of these pathetic 4chan troll raids?
:D No
00,02not a bad orbit either
Yay! More Kerbals
that is a really cool disconnection.
hi Gold_Demona :)
erm...Where are the ponies?
Oh! And spacestations! We need those.
Rain_Down_On_Me: read the rules...
no ponies here. move along citizen!
aw
00,02landing time
or faq
:'(
what is this game
Ooh, just got a streetpass hit
Weeeeeeee
looks fun
pony_9011: Kerbal Space Program
No defiance of physics this time?
Ikr
thanks
So my imagination is going mad, but hear me out. You land a bunch of crap on Mun. Fuel tanks, capsules, etc. Then, you use a rover to push it all together, and pretend it's a Munbase!
derpy gets no love here :(
NOOOOOOO
But derpy is the best :P
they even have a "spike" room. everyone hates spike. but no derpy :(
/me gives DaringDerpy a hug
:)
Nyst: Only with less hilariously terrible text to speech
DaringDerpy: But Spike is best pony :D
00,02should be fun
johnmaddenjohnmadden.
WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY WHYYYYYY
uuuuuuuuu
spike might as well be part of the mane 6. he is in almost every episode
EVERYPONY HATES SPIKE
i dont hate spike
BUT EVERYPONY LOVES DERPY SO WHERE IS SHE :P
spike is a lizard, not a pony
Spike is best pony :|
Spike is best pony. Hank Green said so.
he seems to be the only one with common sense
Spike is a dragon
Dumbass
dragon = lizard
overrated lizard
Get your facts right.
lol
Common sense, so fucking rare it's a super power.
Rain_Down_On_Me: We know. That's why it's funny
Put a space station in orbit full of fuel, connect fuel pipe to landing strut, and you can refuel ships in orbit (not really but just think of it!)
Nothing makes sense in ponyville
Failed
Nice music?
Oh, guess not
nothing makes sense here either
ikr
hears scotland. punches nearest guy in tha balls8
I can make sense of everything
/me loves and tollerates Rain_Down_On_Me. Does it need to make sense? :P
He's landing :D
/me stabs Flyboy in the face with a bayonet
No it doesn't
HAHAH
/me drinks scotch.
and then frogman drowned
Dat Gold_Demona
I'm in Scotland right now
:O
/me blocks it with a kilt
oh...it lands on the ground
Ooh, a beach landing.
Serenity: i know. I LOVE SCOTLAND!
seconded, Rain_Down_On_Me
HE LANDED
celestia is best dictator
<Rain_Down_On_Me>
The Kerbonauts can get out and get a tan.
I think 7 rooms is just fine
MOAR ROCKETS :D
New rocket :P
AWWW fuck this
-V
Shit just got real.
00,02that looks safe
needs more magma
lol
LOL
lol dat stability
Wibbly wobbly rockets
working as intended
00,02theres reason for this
wobblyness is fun?
^yes
Ofc
i like how the music fits with the scenario too
Hi :P
I hate how easy Solid thrusters overheat
Ikr
:3 Welcome to Bronystate - the land of wobbly rockets, exploding parachutes, & self flying wings
Hello Spectrum_Speed
Space ballet.
HES IN SPACE SPACE SPACE
http://i.imgur.com/zQHv4.gif
Cypresswolf: Oh, was you here yesterday when he broke the game?
he broke it?
unfortunately no :) sounds like a moment to remember
Where is dah moon :P piccolo blew it up again -_-
Yeah, he broke the game
And his ship was floating
Serenity: Lol was that his Pinkie Pie ship?
I'M IN SPACE SPACE DERP SPACE
Yeah
Phase accidentally the universe? ....again
I was here yesterday. That was hilarious
Its a space compass
My internet runs out today :c
Fire >.>
MAOR FIRE
You're oging to kill your camera guy if you keep putting him behind the rockets. D:
MOAR i mean :P
Next: a rocket so big it moves the planet out of orbit.
and then, Serenity?
going*
And then you guys will have to survive a week without me
00,02lets see how fast i can hit the planet
LOL
LEEEEROOYYY KKKEEEERRRBAAAL
lol Kerbal massacre time
XD
00,02probably should have thrown the booster away somewhere
kerbal leroy face :D
HIT THE PLANET hahaha
00,02yeah, jeb smiles when he goes fast
I like jeb
Jeb smiles at EVERYTHING
Where can i try this :)
lol stuck in SPACE SPACE SPACE
suddenly speed up
To make jeb sad, you have to literally be on fire doing barrel rolls in water
Epic music for an epic occasion. :D
00,02250km up
00,024.6KM/s
BARREL ROLL DO A DO A BARREL ROLL :D
is this the full game or the free demo
00,02need a bigger rocket
00,02pony_9011, this one is the full game
nice
Ok
http://img.aktuell.ru/rupan0010/images/topfoto.jpg
00,02might reach 5
00,02no
00,02nvm
00,024.8KM/s
Speed it up a little bit
You can get an older full version for free, but to get the latest version you have to pay for it
it thought you were going to crash into the earth?
DROWN
00,02LOL
WHERE DAH MOON!?!?!?!?
00,02booster landed not 100 meters from me
Where's the Kaboom?
Spectrum_Speed: We don't have a Moon. We have a Mun. :P
No explosion :(
XD
00,0285.9G's
FUUCKING SPIDERS 85G?
New personal best? :D
00,02if you were a person beforhand, your not a person after that
Kerbals are immune to G force
Phase4: crash into the earth! you are in command of a doomsday rocket!
HAHAH IT BURNS!
00,02so
If you was a person, you would be reduced to ectoplasm
00,02build a bigger rocket and beat that record?
What chat you on?
85.9 g's turns us into kerbals?
You got 2 chats
what would 86 G's do to the human body?
Phase4 try for a speed record!
Someone want a random link?
00,02Cypresswolf, it wouldnt be a human body afterward
Phase4: Don't change any stages that you can, more stages, higher terminal velocity
KERBAL PNIES :D
*ponies
Cypresswolf: You would be a red pile
it would weigh 86 times its original mass
waiting
not sure if the skeleton is built for this
... O_o
So 2 more days till ponie time... NOOOOOOOO
see how much of the kearth you kan destroy! you must kill all the kerbals or die trying! or both.
Phase4: what song is this?
I'm hungry for a burger
00,02http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEVsGRuHoU&feature=autoplay&list=UUmMWwYyeQlZzbeynRJwCSGg&playnext=24 dis playlist
Must see if mum got any vegetable burgers:3
Can you get off kerbal space program?
Yes, press the little red cross
*presses*
You find some awesome playlists Phase :)
It didn't work LOL
00,02lets see
I'm getting bored of KSP
00,02masterpiece
Thats gonna blow up
00,02Spectrum_Speed, last launch then :P
LOLWUT
Dayum :D
00,02Spectrum_Speed, you junxed it
Phase4: you MUST destroy the kearth.
As soon as it takes off its gonna blow up
told ya
Guys
OOOH
YEAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH EXPLOSIONS :D
Add me and join the Skype call
awww i hate asain woman
Phase4: struts?
There's 14 ppl in
And I'm bored
Mooo
Quack
Can you go on youtube and watch videos for a while? after this?
Cbf using my mic at this hour :/
Cypresswolf: the applebloom plushie achieved a decent price after all. she should have used the photo with the cape as main photo
00,02adding some
Or at least put different music
Ohfor fucks sake
All she got was Beefburgers
DaringDerpy: what was the final bid?
Put a song called ''Boulevard of broken dreams'' on
Spectrum_Speed: no...
375
Plz
Greenday?
CMON ITS A GOOD DAMN SONG
Spectrum_Speed: just no...
whats wrong wit it?
this song reminds me of assassins creed brotherhood
Its a horrible song
DaringDerpy: I was thinking much hight :P I try to avoid the custom plushies, their too expensive and beyond my ebay limit
no one joined your game, Cypresswolf?
Wait... what song is horrible?
*higher
Well after this launch just play a different game Phase
I dont have a game at the moment
Well i just joined this stupid website today so i have no idea wat ur talking about
it looks like one of the plushies that usually go for 150, Cypresswolf. so it's a good price.
That's impossible
00,02i might achive kerbin escape with this
Spectrum_Speed: Oh you're new? :o
How can an inanimate object possess the characteristics to be mentally imapired?
Yeah
the official plushies look as cheap as they are
00,02yeah
00,02there it goes
AdamTheDuck yeah i am
o_O you a mod?
Spectrum_Speed: Lol no :P
Spectrum_Speed: have you paid your membership fee?
No
lol DaringDerpy stop scaring him :P
:P
>_>
DaringDerpy: I might try to order another commission...kinda weary about it though, the last artist that did a commission for me never sent it even after I payed for it and dissapeared
Spectrum_Speed: Be sure to get a bronystate gold account or you will miss out on a lot
:D not scar-HORRIBLE SONG
I'd a like a Timberwolf plush
bad business habit
I will...soon
I'm on a Bronystate Gold :3

/me hugs Jmo

bye *
bye
When I was in school, our teacher would berate us if we used A4 to draw, everything had to be A3 or A2
after a while--A3 started seeming tiny- really helped you to get a sense of details and size in drawing
I used A4 for paper aeroplanes :D
Hehehe
Im not one for blowing my own trumpet, but I was bucking good at making them :D
I was teerrible
They'd always go nose first into the ground, right infront of me
hmm, Wrek, Maybe a fire ruby in the buckle?
I made a plane that you threw upside down :D
!
o_O
The way i folded the wings, made a MOTHERBUCKING RAMJET!
nice
when I was iin--kindergarten I think, my dad has a program on his computer that had like a database of various paper planes
its stupidly simple
really weird ones- and it would print like guides
11,01A#?
normal two fold nose paper plane
so, 27.5 degree nose angle
standard wings
however, you folded the wings into the body
then folded the wingtips into the first fold
aah
made a 3 sided box on the wingtips
you then throw it upside down with all the force you can muster
incredibly fast and stable
nice-
Oh my...
could easily take somebody eye out :D
If I still had A4 I'd try that now
There are other people alive? :O
I only have A3 akvarell from school, rest is digital
Nop, everyone is dead.
It only seems to work in A4
We're a part of your imagination
We're zombies and ghosts
phew
never tried it larger
I was scared there for a second
I think A3 and such is horrible for paperp lanes, too flimsy
and on that note, I tab back into KSP as watching ponies being drawn in a buisy internet cafe in glasgow is not a good idea :D
A3 Aquarell mighit work thouh, that's really stiff
Ooohhh ponies!
Hehehe
/me tackles Vivix
Also A# Nittany?
/me is constantly wounded and in pain from tackles
11,01Whatever your A numbers are. What are those?

11,01Golakka: Were you the guy that requested this drawing?
I figured I'd broaden my horizons
Wrek : i never seen Rarity this Sexy
Suck it up Vivix.
Clearly I made the right choice
/me whimpers
No, I wish i was Nittany_Discord

Good morning everyone.
Hello Firelight|Dj
Good mornin'
Morning
Morning Firelight|Dj
So does the brony community work like jail? Do I have to beat up the strongest brony to earn respect?
Sorry
HAHA
05this gotta be my favorite ARP song
I love that.
Pink: Oh yeah, otherwise the smaller bronies take you
/me tackles Vivix
Like so.
O.O'
Like that!
hehehe
I havn't been on for a while now. My computer crashed and It will cost 120 bucks to renew it... So I won't be on as much as I used too. I'm at the library.
/me backs away slowly and prays to Pinkie Pie
Pink I just stay in solitary all the time.
YOU.
THEM
/me slaps Pink around a bit with a large trout
Also I just wanted to say hi. I got more important things to do like homework I forgot to do and all of that shit. See you guys in a little bit.
Firelight|Dj: aw, that sucks firelight, I hope you get it fixed
Take care Firelight|Dj
05i mean come on
Vivix: Thanks Man.
05isnt this an EPIC song!? :D
05^_^

idd ^^
Sounds like the 80s and pubs
It's about a fox?
S'nice, in a way
05the lead guitar guy does some amazing solos
spell solos backwards
zalos
waitno
/me attacks Pinkies4thWall "HAVE AT YOU!"
Burn the wizard named Vivix.
BURN HIM.
!
But yeah, I like solos like Nels Cline
like--self oscilating delay under it that fucks up the fuzz- noisy jazz
Not sure if you spelled it normally or backwards
I will sit on your head and eat a muffin.
05Vivix turned me into a newt!
It's a lie!
D:
It was Jmo! He's the wizard!
I'm a muffin wizard.
Jmo does that make you a muffin hat?
HAY GUURLZZ
I shall be the muffin wizard hat.
05dammit y u no catch on to holy grail reference
YOU, GOT, BETTER
Boltasar: hey sweetie
hehe
I haven't seen the holy grail, sue me.
Holy Grail is great
On my to-do-list.
I saw it with my much older cousin and his creepy grunge friends
It's the one with the murderous rabbit
And "A witch weighs as much as a duck" something
i don't really 'do' solos, i'm more partial to doing rhthm myself :)
Murderous Rabbit? Watership Down?
and the french
BronyInstrumental: I stoppe ddoing solos for like-- 3 years, but now I like some of them
Is wreck still drawing?
ANd the bridge of death
Almost none of the band's I listened to had solos
ANd the knights who say "Ni"
the bridge of death is in fallout 2
Dat wreck
So its a pirate pony?
Nope its a ninja
Nop, it's an astronaut^
Dang I was so close
Can't you tell the damn difference Barbetos|AtWork, jeez.
I almost said fire fighter.
Hehehe
That would of been embarassing
Oh you.
Cannot unsee rarity fire fighter now
Not sure if sexy.
AGH I MADE IT WORSE!!
Old timey firefighter?
/me pounds face into keyboard
they said I could be anything I wanted, so I decided to become EVERYTHING!:D
/me is mildly intruiged
The music is making this an insanely dramatic drawing :D
Rofl.
I remember when Neville Longbottom said that
I really like the seams-
god I love those seams-
I need to try colouring- I usually only do sketches, and then say "I*M DONE!"
Do you like the seams?
I looove them
they look like texture work for games-
I really couldn't tell.
I know, right?
mornin' folks
Morning MirrorImage
Vivix: They do, actually
i might try my hand at some digital art, i've never done it before
Yeah- they're really neat-
I like digital, because whenever I do oil paint I get messy
but oil paint is so much sexier than akryl or--yeah
OILPAINT EVERYWHERE
/me tackles Vivix
!
hey guys
when I first came in I thought it had a serious tf2 vibe to it
Washing your hands after doing oilpaint is like- you're water repellant
Hay alexxm
how you doing Jmo
I'm good, yourself?
Hey alexxm. How are you w
i'm good Jmo and PillowPoni how about you
hey, that OC drawing, maybe i could try using SAI to colour that, see how it turns out
yeah
Tis good.
Sai is great at colours
eH's a cool guy
I still kinda want Corel Painter, but- the dirty brush didn't work to me
Praise the almighty SAI
alexxm I'm fine
Just watching Black Dynamite
well, i have it installed but i've never needed it seeing as i was too scared of being mocked by my dad when i used his scanner for the sketch :/
I love black dynamite
Aah
its sad that he's putting so much effort into the outfit tho, cuz once that pony goes super saiyan its clothes will just explode
just saiyan
like a michal bay film...
hehehe
Explosions. If my movie is loadeer than the others, than it MUST be GOODERERERER

2 fucking 1 GB RAM chips for it
MadSurge: Indeed. =D
/me has 8 gigs RAM
/me pounces Thunder-Crescent and takes a morning muffin
/me has 16
Serenity mmmmmm nice.
(Has 512mb)
fine then be that way vivix
o_o
Vivix, I will beat you with soap >.>
Hehehe
Serenity I have GB of RAM and I need more to run games, but that also means I need to get a 64-bit OC.
Gold_Demona: and to think Rarity used to be my least fav :D
*gets back up and eates his own morning muffin
So need to reformat the drive
Serenity 3GB
Heya :)
Canadian_Brony: My laptop has 4
umad
hi MaxTheBrony
srsly tho, what is this song?
I had 4GB for many years, and yeah games woul crash on me on W7, not to mention music software and animation stuff-
DoctoDoctorWho PM wrek :)
Serenity yes. That can play TF2 and Minecraft
Hllo MaxTheBrony
But unfortunately, my laptop has the worst CPU and graphics
Heya Canadian_Brony and MLP_Brovakiin :D
my computer doesnt like to use its better graphics card though, so I have to hook it up to a second monitor if I want to play any decent games on it
MaxTheBrony: Hello!
Canadian_Brony: Laptop can't run Minecraft
i have 1GB can that play TF2
Heya AJIsAwesome
GFX isn't good enough
Is the smileys gone?
i cant see mine
You can run TF2 on 512
O.o
Yes!
DoctoDoctorWho: Alex Rudi Pell - The Masquerade Ball
When it was first released, you could run it on 256
Vivix Vista and 7 hog more RAM then XP, but Vista takes the most.
/me gazes at the glory that is #bronystate in a real client
So yeah, right now I'm reformatting thr drive
Canadian_Brony: Yeah, W7 made it necesarry for me to have at least 8, and since 16 was on offer I got that
Gonna reinstall windows, then put in my chips
/me pokes Pink
Pink: are you new?
^
Vivix: I'm running Windows 8 just fine on 4gb
You lost me at W8.
It runs fine, but I couldn't run heavy programs
/me pounces Jmo and squeezes him tightly
xD
I need to get some more hdmi cables, and to get my other monitor back from my brother because he doesnt use it
D'awwww
MadSurge: Yes indeed!
Heya Jmo :)
Vivix duuuude . . . don't you think 16GB is, you know, overkill?
Heyo MaxTheBrony
HDMI Moniters?
Canadian_Brony, you can never have overkill.
And such an interesting place I have found
What the hell planet am I om?
Jmo . . . okay that's true.
I still have a freaking TIME moniter
Canadian_Brony: noo, I eh- games sure yeah overkill, but it was cheap, and it helps me do longer takes on Cubase, which EATS ram like candy, not to mention other software like that
Pink: :O this calls for a WELCOME PARTY!
Pink just wait until Movie Night.
/me "SQUEE!" glomps MadSurge
Even my TV isn't HDMI
>.>
o.o
Pink: You should see movie night. Much more epic.
wow
Oooohhhh movie night?...
Did somebody say PARTY? 8D
Vivix oh, yeah in that case it was probably "What the buck" amiright?
:)
But before I can reformat shitbox, I need to copy over my files
Heya Gold_Demona :)
Chat is officially alive.
Yeah, it only cost like--ehh 900kr wihich is--maybe 100 bucks? ANd - I had the money, and it would benefit my music software, so-- yeah why not
Huzzah~
Aww yeaah
Hiya MaxTheBrony
So uhm... Just a question
Copying over 100gb of crap onto my ExHD
I don't mean to offend anyone but I have pretty good reason to ask
How is the owner of this place?
do ask
Hm?
Is he a real jerk?
Who?
Pink Fridays 7pm EST / 4pm PST. Also Saturdays 2pm EST / 11am EST.
Ah
>.>
Pink: so, welcome to Bronystate! Be sure to read the rules and enjoy your stay!
I was watching MLP on The Hub just now, and they said "We're now back to My Little Pony Friendship is Magic. Now 20% Cooler". I got a kick out of it :D
Pink: Who don't you ask him?
I come from canternet and the owner of the main channels is a real bad guy :(
No the admins here are usually pretty nice Pink, better than when I was on Fimchat
I'm gonna leave that for others to say.
The mods are not bad
here
:)
XylemTube: IKR?:D
Phew...
Pink: All mods are great here, should you obey the rules :)
they are very kind and funny
Pink I've never asked that, but the mods keep the chat in sync and work the stream.
Pink: the mods here are all nice people.
I've been here for a year, and I don't think any of the mods are dicks, mabye Sumica's characterisation, but heh
LAst place I was in was pure cyberbullying by the owner of the channels...
they have some wierd rules sometimes
00,10How dare you call me nice.
xD
Hehehe
haha
dohoho
hi Sumica. O U
Aw Pink.
Pink: I've been to places like that, just couldn't be bothere to hang there anymore
hay sumica whats up
Pink: they might kick you once for trolling purposes, but that's it :D
Sorry, Sumica isn't nice. Sumica is awesome!
AJIsAwesome: i think it's nice to know that The hub is fully aware of the fandom here.
Im glad that i found this place :D
it makes me relax
Well, he's probably gonna burn me for waking him up
He thought my art was ugly so if I posted it I got banned
ikr MaxTheBrony
But lets forget that and move on to greener pastures!
o.o
Pink D:
!
yeah
Pink: Well, everyone's welcome here. Have a great time here at Bronystate!
Pink . . . well THAT was a dick move.
There's rules here, and as long as we follow them everyones nice
00,10Nah realy we try to make it nice here. Some times we have to be a bit rough with some one that is trying to spoil fun for others
Pink here we give the artitst feedback instead
Suck it up Golakka :P
welcome to the herd pinkie
xD
Golakka: He probably did it for a joke ;)
XylemTube: And they're very supportive of us, too.
Golakka not to me.
05Golakka: yeah he does have a huge ar... oh.
I know SB has a habit for kicking me for no reason :3
never noticed golakka
Wrek :D

AJIsAwesome: even better to know :D

/me was hugged
So wrekky

And then he walked into the chat
Lol :D
/me it was super effective
Reading session time.
Pink: as long as you're not obnoxious or spam bad links, we welcome fanart :)

Wrek, Did you?
I draw ms paint ponies with a time limit :P

I've been here for a year and 1 month >:3
Pink: You can post video links, just not during a stream.
Yeah, jsut read up the rules to be safe, they like us reading those
05Golakka: hm?
here Pink just read these rules and abide them http://www.bronystate.net/rules/ , avoid offensive jokes ya know like racist or rape jokes, listen to the mods ( you'll know them by their colored text, and you'll have a great time here :)
I've been here for . . . 5 months-ish
Been here since November 2011
05oh
Spectrum_Rush, way ahead of you :

Serenity, technically they are in space so she isnt really flying
Fucking wrek, seriously I kind of mad at you and pinkie now
Oh Golakka you're murdering me. Too funny.
XD
if feel for you golakka
I've been here for a while, probably--10 months, I don't know, andlast night I met val the jean for the first time, and he was like "I've been here for over a year!"
I had never seen him before-
xD
Wrek and pinkie are now on my shitlist
so emberassing
I have never seen Golakka around :P
literally, I have a list of people I want to shit on
wat.
Oldest user I know other than the mods is probably Meanwhile or otakon
Im very rarely here MaxTheBrony
Wish I could've come here sooner. My life would've been so much happier......:$
Hey uhm.. ARe there any RP channels or something?
Pink: I think I know who it might be, but... who's your fav pony? :D
Pink: Dashiesauce
i've been here a while
Vivix you do know ValtheJean and Caramel are the same mod, right?
Ah
havent I been here longer then meanwhile?
meh
Canadian_Brony: yeah, I asked him who he was and he said "ValTheJean" and I was a qusetionmark, I'd seen his name but never met him or seen him chat
Vivix ah.
cowvarkian: I dunno, didn't you have a huge hiatus after a couple months after I joined?
sure
Pink: If you want to RP, type in "/me" before you type anything else. Just don't spam the RP. I made that mistake.:$
valthejean is awesome pony
when'd you join serenity
yeah, full RP is eh not here
I'll take as a no I haven't, and Serenity is a fucking loonatic
AJIsAwesome, channels not how to RP >.>
u guys are funny
Read ze question properly :<
cowvarkian: Around mid July last year
Vivix I have talked to all the mods except VioletVanilla. I've seen her name in the chat, but never saw any text
hmm
no, I don't think I've been here that long
11,01Vi hasn't been in lately.
Canadian_Brony: I saw her a few times when Ifirst got here, she speaks like half german english
but I dunno
Nittany_Discord: Vivi?
I'm not sure if I got a long with her, but I never really-talked to her
Jmo: Whoops......:$
ohia Nittany_Discord. Darn, she
DAMMIT
Heya Nittany_Discord :)
Jmo: I make that mistake all the time.:$
i love bronystate
Canadian_Brony: that's because she usually makes awesome music, not talk :D
she's the last one on my list of mods to meet
I really may have been here for a year, I don't remember
It's alright AJIsAwesome ;D
>.>
MadSurge that would explain alot.
I'm usually never here to hear music, so I've never heard her stuff
silly memory why you no
/me slaps Vivix
Be here more often.
xD
;__; I like noise and instruments
I pity the fool he don't visit often.
and they don't play that here- so I mute the stream pretty often
Music?
:p
I'm often too busy to watch the stream
I love watching the stream, but I often listen to other things while watching
But I do drop in now and then to see what sexually arous..I mean interesting activities you lot are up to.
I actually stopped watching the stream alot after the season ended...
Serenity: :D
Vivix; What instruments do you plaaay
I always stop what im doing when wrek is drawing :D
I usually watch movies, episodes and when they play games
I am using wrek at the moment as a teacher :P he have shown me some new moves :)
I was about to add RainBroDash to the list, but I've talked to him once or twice.
Jmo: I PITY THE FOAL WHO DOUBTS WRECKS DRAWING METHODS!
Gets me to work on my artwork and try to improve myself :P
Jmo: bass, guitar, most fretted instruments, some drums and extremely tiny amount of keyboard
WRECKS.
DoctoDoctorWho: Well first, you need to spell his name right
WHAT IS WRECKS ;-;
:p
i'm not the music man, i come from up the road and i can plaaaay~
Vivix, learn the piano nao.
;__;
I usually only play keys if I want synth in my songs, that makes for lousy practice
I know de piano :3
first drawing i saw of wrek was a schematic for a rifle for a video game
The piano, such a wonderful instrument, touches my heart.
Jmo: i took 4 years piano lessons but i forgetted it ;__;
When I first came here, I was only here for the movies. However, as I visited here more often, I'm here much longer than I used to be. I'm glad I came to Bronystate.
Sif BronyInstrumental, Sif.
I remember seeing Wrek draw SB's first OC
You people make me wanna cry ;~;
Hehe
I love the piano. Been taking it for over 10+ years.
O.o
i think i've been here pretty much since the beginning
Waow
I was speaking possesive, as in "those methods belong to Wreck"
I love piano, but I want to buy a proper piano vst before playing it-
Still Wrek :3
/me flips Vivix
A REAL PIANO.
not wreck * ^^
i've been teaching myself guitar and bass for about 3 months now
/me hands Jmo a tissue
DoctoDoctorWho: stop being a dumbass and spell it right
I can't afford one ;__;
Dark_Horst: I guess you could say the same for me, if you count 2 months after it beginning
GAH
/me glomps AJIsAwesome
DoctoDoctorWho: do it with me W-e-r-k. come on you can do it
I've been playing since I was 14, soo..9 years?
First time I watch Wrek stream is a pic of Vinyl Scratch and she way lying on a pile of pillows
/me hugs Jmo back
Dovah: That spells Werk you hypocrite
I'm suppose to be reading damn it >.>
14 + 9 O.o =23?
:3
:p
Ah, I see my grammatical error
23, yeah
Serenity: lol oohs
/me throws a book at Jmo
Dammit my stream froze hours ago and i didnt notice
5 + 5 = fish
loading....
W-r-e-k
I knew it!
I only play the piano if I want to. I don't like when people force me to.
2+2= 9
*when*
HOLY FUCKING BATSHIT ON A STICK WREK!
2+2 is 10
Serenity: better?
DAH
I need this on my wall!
AJIsAwesome: force breeds resistance, I'm glad I kinda fell into learning instruments, otherwise it would be a chore and I'd enver do it- probably
Serenity: silly filly, 2+2=fish, not 5+5
That Pirarity drawing is coming along nicely, Wrek.
I absolutely love to play drums, adore it, but since I moved I can't set up my kit here, neighbours are too close
/me sad that she has to miss out on a Wrek stream because her computer is being an ass
bleh, digital art. i draw all my stuff by hand
Vivix: I know. I'm learning how to play the guitar soon.
AJIsAwesome xD i see what you did there
DoctoDoctorWho: No, 5 + 5 = fish, 2 + 2 is 10
Dem chat derps
:P
http://i.imgur.com/35ve7.gif
Heya Ponies47 :)
This is my reaction this debate
AJIsAwesome: It's a lot of fun, and when you know one fretted instrument, learning others go pretty fast
Hey MaxTheBrony :3
AJIsAwesome: do you already have a teacher or a book? otherwise it's gonna take you a while
Vivix: Alright. I'll take your word for it.:)
serenity those colors hurt my eyes
hi Ponies47. Welcome to random plus stream. Mostly random.
:p
Serenity: ask emperor joker, he made it equal fish. get your math straight son!
I learned instruments by listening to music and reading tabs, only teacher I had was in 'college'
Canadian_Brony: I LOVE RANDOM THINGS! :D
BronyInstrumental: I was thinking of buying some books, but could you recommend some?
/me throws a muffin tin at Ponies47
http://i.minus.com/jvoXf5XSLjr30.jpg
cowvarkian: Then that's a sign of mis seeing the awesomeness

Wrek do you also get jagged edges when you use the select tool and fill it?
Ooh

AJIsAwesome: I would recomend you learn how to read tabs, and just start out like that, free and easy, books can be confusing- I don't know any
I have a streetpass hit
Vivix: Ok.
AJIsAwesome: doesnt matter, the art of war would still help, somehow...
AJIsAwesome: and i've only been doing it for a couple months. seeing as i can play most songs now with a little practice, i think i've done pretty well for myself :)
Serenity: You have a 3DS?
Serenity lucky! I never get hits.
Yeah
I had one of those
Sometimes I play while reading fanfiction-
O.o
I've gotten lazy with practice
Okay. Thank you all for your advice!
Canadian_Brony: This is my third one this week
05MaxTheBrony: make sure AA is checked
I'll sit on your head if you don't practice Vivix.

I need harder and louder songs
Jmo: This wut I do. I sit on you
Wrek: Is it on the select tool advanced options?
Sonova.
I have muffins, don't you try sitting on me.

OOOOOOOOOOO
Gigantic fucking chokky cakes are better

/me throws a muffin tin at Serenity
Serenity: HISSSSSSS! BLASPHEMER!!!
Try at malls, towns and other places that have game shops
/me pulls out rocket launcher
Oh shiney!

BronyInstrumental: I play folk, alt, noise, rock, jazz and such- I've never practiced playing things like black veil brides-
Fucking adverts, argh

I just think it looks different from rarity
whatever you say george, sumica
Those are definately rarity eyes though.
Hey Malavolent :3
Omelette with salt, cheese and herbs de province
I just had some pancakes and bacon.
Wrek seems to draw Rarity a lot lately.
All this talk about breakfest is making me hungry >.<
I like my eggs scrambled
I was also gonna have a veggie burger
O.o i just got a flashback while reading this text ;p
But my mother bought fucking beefburgers
Oh Wrek a new tribes update just got out today :P
Over easy with egg whites.

Heya SirGanjalf :)
Ponies47 well, it is morning here. And I did wake up 20 minutes ago.
Serenity: are you a vegitarian?
Hey guys, I just figured something: Pip Squeek is a blank flank right?
DoctoDoctorWho: Yeah
Heya Tervicz :)
00,10did you guys ever see the sky captan AJ wrek did?
Tervicz: I think so...I'll have to check.
Tervicz yeah. Hi.
hi MaxTheBrony
Sumica no D:
me too serenity
Serenity: BLASPHEMY!!
Maybe he'll become the 4th crusader?
I'm an involuntary vegetarian, more and more meat just makes me sick, so little of it I can eat
Sumica: I've seen the other AJ D:
Sumica: Might have
Sumica: I didn't...:(
Sumica . . . no. Link plz?
Sumi I believe I have
Like the 3 musketeers
Sumica I saw that one. It was awesome
Link :D
Serenity: Techy update, To be precise missile turret, A type of explosive plasma ish thing as primary and a tiny repair thing as belt and you can have it anywhere you want
i need to see it!
Sumica that's the one he made in Illustrator, right?
killerpony7733: So basically, something new for the Engineer class?
Hi, Good morning everyone
Oh yeah
Goddamnit.
Canadian_Brony: It's still morning here as well. I have been up since 9:00 AM and I haven't had any food what so ever and it's 11:00 AM now.

Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Vocal Music: Where I Want To Be / The Joy of Waiting / Sh-pony!
Morning TheGreatAndPowerfulT :)
hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT
Serenity: Yup it has made the techy more defensive and explosive ish and the little repair thing is a good thing to put around when you can't get to a place quick enough
DoctoDoctorWho: It's not, but I just can't stand the taste anymore. Even hamburgers are disgusting unless they don't taste anything like meat- it's just odd
XD Lol Scream Pony music
Bacon is one of the few things I still love
That was an awesome stream to sit through
great pic sumica
so epic
I hate meat
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Morning!
The texture is almost as bad as pear texture
MaxTheBrony . . . tch.

Vivix: I just could never give up meat, I mourn your meat-loving loss
Dat square.
Sumica he doesn't vector anymore I guess? :(
Peh, I replace all that crap with cake.
DoctoDoctorWho: Oh I'm not encouragin others, it just sorta happened- it's weird

Chrysalis: I mainly go there for the comments
Wrek should draw twi as a pyromancer
Do you guys suppose Pip Squeek would make a good D'artagnan?
His responses are hilarious
xD
00,03Rough night, but things are looking up ^_^
Chrysalis: Yeah! Inspires me to improve! :$
Scoot-Scootaloo: Good :3
i know i post on most of his pictures that ask for feedback
Sumica: I dont think I was watching the stream for that one. There's another RD vector he did with her wings spread like she's flying
00,10ahh
Heya Chrysalis :)
00,10must be more recent
glad to hear things are lookin up Scoot-Scootaloo
The first thing I saw drawn in here was the Vinyl Wallpaper :)
Sumica: I think Wrek did that one a few months ago....it was earlier this year, I believe
Scoot-Scootaloo whatever the predicament, just remember: It could be worse. You could be where I just forced into . . .
*I was just forced into

My computer is not only slow, but screwed up
Didn't he recently do one with her wearing something, levitating wine, and giving bedroom eyes?

Hugs for Wrek~

Golakka: And your feet? :p
Golakka: Pah, man up.
My feet are fine now
My pinkie is out of its joint
My dad is meh and dooesn't really give to bucks about me being a brony. :P
Wrek better than when my sister walked in on my watching "Sisterhooves Social" before I told anyone I was a brony . . . gawd that was terrifying.
Dovah: to be perfectly honest, Ill get it right eventually and I really dont give a damn untill i do
*two
Golakka: Aw, so I don't get to chop them off? :(
Nope
00,10the finished will end up on DA thrackerzod
my dad mocks me every time i see him, so i countertroll by wearing every piece of swag i have when he's around
I bet if I brohoofed Wrek, he'd probably break his arm
I just am safe in the knowledge that I got you crucified on stage :D
Wrek: http://derpy.me/oOyp3
Golakka: Eh, I think you deserve it anyway. :p
Wrek has a hell of a right hook on him Serenity
And my wrist would shatter, if I did it with my right arm
DoctoDoctorWho: hey look i typed doc then hit tab... not that difficult..
Golakka: I have one hell of a pain receptor
... Crap i sure hope my father dont look at mine... he would execute me
05Golakka: sorry bout the viking hoof
Sorry?
SORRY?
Lol!!!
IT WAS FUCKING AWESOME!
05but i think it was gumri that managed to take one without bitchign about it
Golakka: Do you mind if I brohoof you in the face next time then? :p
Gumri has no sense of pain wrek :D
05no shit
GilDash|Gaming :D
I don't either
Golakka: So you brohoofed Wrek but he used a little to much force? O.O
Wrek: idea: show dad the episodes!
N, Really
I stabbed myself yesterday with a kitchen knife :3
._.
By accident, before you call me emo!
Nice Serenity.
We practically broke the laws of physics, the brohoof was that strong
Serenity: Maybe you shold get that checked out......:S
My computer background used to be Celestia and Luna kissing- all my friends saw it, noone said anything-
Dovah: oh look, I just dropped all the fucks I was supposed to give, It seemes I dont have any left. what a pity.
Golakka: Ah, so that's what caused that fire. XD
Serenity I was about to ask if it was accidental.
AJIsAwesome: Nah, it's already healing
Next year wrek, Instead of you going to bed
I challenge you

Golakka: Hey, my particular vice is whisky, so...

00,10yeah 21 wrek
Hallo CCCP

Sumica: He's legal. XD
CCCP: Welcome back!
Only downside of me going to BUCK is, I hate drinking to all hell. once that crap starts, I'll have to bugger off before I kill someone :/
05oh right
Wrek, You will have your anus destroyed in a drinking contest with me
hi Ponies47 MLP_Brovakiin alexxm and AJIsAwesome

it was £5.99 for a jack and coke
Nice! :D
Wrek: Sneaky bastard
hai Gold_Demona :3
Golakka: And that's why I was on beer. XD
Jack? Jack Daniels?
Drinking was always a waste of money in my eyes-
18 is drink, 21 is booze in Norway
I cannot drink beer
Wrek there where a lot of people trying to take advantage of you =P
I think it's like that most places
I'm so proud of Vivix.
it makes me vomit
00,10Sorry wrek, no bunnyranch for you till your 21.
I can drink at 19
Come to mexico we have tequila and you can drink as long as you are 18 or over
Go Australia with 18 laws.
In our country, if you aren't in public, you're actually allowed alchohol at the age of 5, as long as it's moderated by parents
Serenity :O
I started drinking when I was 16, so I'd have been breaking the law in any country. lol
k, bye for now
I think France is the same
Oh lord >_>
Erm
seeya sirgan-
If you are with your parents, and its before 5pm
in scotland...
I never went to parties, yeah- I just thouht it was- silly
00,10France has wine as part of a balence breakfast
the legal drinking age is 9
05its ok sumica
Also, before you all call me a drunkard, I'm not. I hate drinking, I hate drinkers.
05by the time i have enough money to visit
05ill be 30
Well this is some interesting conversation.
Yeah, here in the U.S. you're not EVER allowed unless you're over 21. Not even in the comfort of your own home
Golakka: And that's 9 months, just to clarify for our members here.
Wrek: Why not just drag Sumica over the sea?
Yeah
05becasue he want to show me vegas
Wrek: Just look at google maps :3
Hehehe
I'm never going to vegas-
Vivix, we're going to vegas.
I kinda want to go to NYC, just because
New Vegas? =P
No buts.
but even that is too city for me too feel comfortable
I miss Las Vegas. Living there was awesome. Texas blows. =\
I'm never going to 'murica
would love to og to Vegas to see what it is liek andmaybe meet up with Sumica
!
Jmo: I WIL LESCAPE

Oh Vivix.
00,10Vegas is fun if you got cash to blow
/me is scared
:
*:D
yeah hmm...
/me doesn't drink
Vegas is beautiful, but I'm paranoid about crime rates
Wrek you HAVE to go to Vegas! I'm 15 and I had a good time there! No drinks, no gambling. Even my 6-yr-old sister enjoyed it. You jsut have to know where to go.
00,10if you dont it's just like any other city except you can get any thng deliverd at any time of the day
Im awful at gambling, but love it sooo muuuch
Sumica I enjoyed myself just fine with friends, Sams Town arcades, and college life.
/me mearly takes opioids daily, but does not drink!!!
Only place in the world I fancy going is probably either Sweden, and not because Wrek, and mabye Italy
Good ol times. CSN was a lot of fun.
/me pets Barbetos
Sweden is beautiful
^
^^
v
Canada is nice to
00,03>_>
*too
yeah
/me sits on the floor with a pouty face and gets petted.
its not fair!
So is Finland
I don't fancy Canada
00,03...MURIKKA!
I'd like to visit many places, but I can't fly yet
They make speak British, but meh
england is alright, i guess
Scoot-Scootaloo pfft, you can't drink there until 21. Up here, 19 or 18, depending on the province.
Englands a bit fucked up in the economical side, but we;re a lovely bunch, I assure
I would like to go to Europe in general.
I'd love to visit Europe someday. Just have to win the lottery. :P
so Wrek where do u live again?
i dont get the IRA...
I want to visit the countryside in england, but that's about it
Sweden
I have never been outside of the US. I want to get out and see what it's like in a diffrent country
Antartica.
CCCP: terrorists
I would love to visit England, Europe and Greece.
Ponies47 same here.
Ponies47: Come to Britain, it's like a less fucked version of 'murica
BronyInstrumental well yeah, but i dont really get what they want
If I can save up enough, I would like to travel to Ireland.
Ponies47: You should. I've been to Canada, Argentina, and Japan.
CCCP: no one does, they're terrorists!
CCCP: It's weird, I think it has to do with religion and whether or not they are part of britain
before they were terrorists they were a political party, I think
/me really wants to visit Japan
fun fact: there'S a battlefield 3 server in the antarctica
Shin Eid? I can't remember
why do they care though Vivix?
PillowPoni: You should. Just be careful.
Dunno, I think they're holding on to a sort of "We aren't british" nationalism thing
say what you want, but this one wont have heating problems
http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v449/CaptRicoSakara/sorrowEdgeCommission1copy.jpg guess what game this is from :3 (warning minor gore is in this pic)
CCCP: i think they want ireland to be not in the united kingdom and northern ireland is considered in the UK, so they try to change that
AJIsAwesome whats it like and what part did you to go?
I wanted to go to BUCK to bad. hey would be a good trip! I can go to BUCKnad then the rest can do waht ever they want :P

i'm pretty sick of Bristol. all there is to do here is a few overpriced theme parks and bars that i can't legally get into ;_;
When I graduate from college, I'm moving up to the northern United States
Sumica: We all don't live on farms :P
AJIsAwesome which part the hotels or the vending machines with panties?
USED panties
yep
Serenity, what does you mean?
dont forget to emntion that
Derpy_at_work, ah fair enough. It's a really great drawing though :3
Props to the artist.
PillowPoni: One of the hotels we went to had a sex DVD in it.........:S
All the hotels I've ever been to have had porn on the tv
^
In a vending machine AJIsAwesome or in the hotel room?
Barbetos: Hotel room.
Like.. Bible right next to the porn dvd?
i've only ever been to 1 hotel and that was last weekend. no porn
you don't want to know what I saw on my Vegas hotel's TV
its pay per view,
You'd know Vivix.
Barbetos: Sorta like that.
in germany its 16+ for softcore, so all the german hotels had softporn at evenings
>__>
Vivix O_o me gusta?
<,< I was a kiid I couldn't pay that
It was--weird
me no sure if gusta
I'M SURE.
we were on a school trip, so we were liek three guys glaring at it like O.o
defenitely not me gusta
Russian Laws are best Laws
PillowPoni: Well if I ever do get to BUCK it will be kind of hard to say hello because first of all he will be running around alot and be VERY busy. But I'm pretty sure there will be a time you could dsay hell oand talk to him for a few minutes :P
British law: urine porn goes under obscenity law and can't be sold
Soviet*
CCCP can you drink at 18 in some parts?
Serenity, what's wrong with minecraft?
Wrong BronyInstrumental
All countries have crazy laws
either oudated or not in use, or in use
MMmmmbanana!
yeah
BronyInstrumental, i can name one! banning handguns...
MelaPonie: It's been ruined by some gamebreaking features
Anybody here been to Amsterdam? If so is it like the way its portrayed ib movies or is it different?
no banning hand guns is something all countries should do
In*
Golakka: well excuse me for not studying the legal system in my spare time >.>
Its legal to sword a scotsman weilding a crossbow in yorkminster square between the hours of mid-day and midnight on a saturday
Nice music
Canadian_Brony It's legally to buy alcoholic drinks after 18 years. But this rule actually works only in some restaurants or in some cases when special inspectors are near.
BAAAACK
Vivix: I agree. Would cut crime rate by 60%
PillowPoni no city IRL is the same in movies.
Hey Spectrum_Speed :3
Golakka that is oddly specific...
But also at the same time wouldn't do shit
Maybe, it would just--it makes no sense since you can't use it for hunting, and it's illegal to collect bombs, so why let peopel collect guns?
Canadian_Brony, Australia is o.O
Some law maker was trying to save his own skin
Who is streaming?
Yes, it is Barbetos :D
Its a law from the 1600s
Jmo I said no CITY.
Dude nice drawing
Sydney is the same as in movies.
Only weapons that are legal in Britain are single shot rifles for hunting
hi Spectrum_Speed. Wrek.
That's no city, what am I thinking.
Seriously nice drawing
>_>
But I actually have a WWII luger stashed somewhere from Inheritance from my late Great Grandad :3
I'm torn, because I love old things
so I would love to SEE that
Serenity: That's awesome. =D
but I'd neever want it in my house
I just got latest site to watch all of dragon series
Vivix: Unfortunately, I lost the clip.
Vivix, you're gonna like it in your house and that's that.
Nooo
I don't like--dangerous things
WHO IS STREAMING!?
Pucker up princess.
Spectrum_Rush: Wrek.

Spectrum_Rush watch how much you post. 6 messages in 10 seconds gets you kicked for spam.
And before you say, I couldn't give to pieces of pootis if it's legal or not
ok
I coudl get banned all ther time then
lol

FOR THE LOVE OF LUNA MAKE SURE WHEN YA TAB YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT
You two aren't the same person!?
Spectrum_Rush I WIL
nice music
NIGGA STOLE HALF MY NAME
Vivix obviously not.
hi Fluttershy|
05Spectrum_Speed: relax
i've been here for a year
Spectrum_Rush better than having your entire name taken.
Spectrum_Speed: Pretty sure Rish has been here much longer than you
Spectrum_Rush: Be careful. Stuff like that can get you kicked.
I thouht maybe it was your "I'm on a different computer name Spectrum_Rush
Canadian_Brony: AJIsAwesome stop tab failing
Vivix, what amkes you think handguns should be banned everywhere?
Spectrum_Rush t'is impossibru! Just ask Ponies47.
Well i came up with this name on my own i did not steal it
I fucking hated this song on EBA
MelaPonie: they can't be used for hunting, that's about it
/me Is getting confused by Spectrum_Rush and Spectrum_Speed 6_9
^
Vivix: I am always Spectrum_Rush no matter what computer im on
Canadian_Brony: Wait what?
Vivix, they most certainly can be used while hunting
I saw it on one of my comments on my account :P
Spectrum_Rush: Then how come there are two Spectrums?
last I heard it was illegal to use them in hunting, for sake of teh animal, but I don't care about those laws much, so I don't know
Ponies47 how many times have I tab-failed your name?
Everypony is being put into the dictionary!
Spectrum_Rush: I was talking to Spectrum_Speed.
11,01It's spectrums, Ponies47. Spectrums.
Canadian_Brony: Yeah, I do it too
IDK
/me is so confuse
Nittany_Discord I don't think that helps.
at all
I just saw this name for a male rainbow dash and i liked it
Canadian_Brony: Well with ponibas and I... ALOT! :D
Ponies47 exactly
Nittany_Discord: Oh. And hi! :D
HUZZAH! THE SPECTRUMS HAVE BEEN DOUBLED!
11,01I thought r63 RD was called Rainbow Blitz?
-_-
Nittany_Discord: I think so, yeah
NOT SO FUN FACT THERES ACTUALLY SOMEONE ELSE THAT GOES BY JUST Spectrum on this sight too
Nittany_Discord: You're right.
Nittany_Discord *blinks* first I hear of this.
WTF 3 SPACTRUMS
SPECTRUMS*
Well R63 Applejack is called Applejack :P
yeah
Vivix, when you have a bear charging you, what do you want... a S&W .500 Magnum at your side which you can pull and empty 5 or 6 half inch rounds into the bear... or a bolt action Remington 700 which gives you one, maybe 2 shots before the bear is upon you?
PROTIP: Pink pony is best pony
I am fucking confuesed
HUZZAH! THE SPECTRUMS HAVE BEEN TRIPLED!
Vivix, where do you live?
neither, I wouldn't be there MelaPonie , I don't want to debate it
STFU AND GTFO
Norway
the best r63 pic i saw was guy-ra
:P
AJIsAwesome: haha :D
@AJIsAwesome SHUT UP
guy ra is getting popular
HOLY SHIT HIS PPAINTING IS GOOD
Nittany_Discord: funny you should mentian that i came up with this name originally by think of a differen r63 nme for Rainbow Dash, other then Rainbow Blitz, though now Its the name for my oc
Calm down guys, just joking around.:S
hi all
hi Bigjack
Spectrum_Speed: CALM DOWN!
BronyInstrumental lol first i read it was r34 and i was like O.o
Bigjack: Hello!
11,01Also, hi Ponies47
Hey Bigjack
Vivix, interesting... so handguns should be banned everywhere in the world, don't confuse you with the facts your mind is already made up and will never change?
I came up with this name by thinking rainbow dash as a man
its Rarity as pirate ;D?
Spectrum_Speed: IKR?
/me slaps MaxTheBrony "NO"!
it will enver change, because I'm not interested in it. Whether or not the politicians change the law is up to them
:s How does he do that soft shadeing :s
YOU JUST GOT TOLD MaxTheBrony
TOLDDDD
:P
I'm also for banning hunting, mind you. So my opinions are pretty fucked on the matter
Vivix, soap.
^
what a programm yo uuse=?
Me and rush got the half of the same name by the same idea -_-
Jmo: haha
Buzzkilled Serenity.
/me washes mouth
Bigjack what program wrek uses?
me to vivix
Spectrum_Speed: small world aint it
Vivix, if you're not interested in it, then why do you have the opinion of ban them everywhere? i mean if you don't care why do you care?
I'm heading out everypony. I'll be back later.
Jmo: I was hoping you was referencing Rubberfruit
Go watch soap.wmv now
Thank you Wrek for the always awesome stream.
Canadian_Brony: Bye!
Bye for now Canadian_Brony :)
Vivix, you're the one that brought up hunting... not me...
Later Canadian_Brony
dem eyes
Here is an idea, let's hunt down Vivix with BB Guns.
MelaPonie: It makes me angry, for no eh legitimate reason. Handguns are made to kill people, for the most part, so I don't see why people should be allowed to have them at all
Nooo, bb guns hurt
looks like an alien
ya know now that i recall there actually another person on here, goes by the name Spectrum_Star
xD
'FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Why so much Spectrum
Spectrum_Rush: There is
Vivix, this is for the good of Bronystate.
Give for the cause.
and since I get angry for no proper reason, I don't want to debate it- it's useless to have me on such a debate
Hehe
hUZZAH! THE SPECTRUMS HAVE BEEN QUADRUPLED!
THE SPECTRUMS HAS BEEN QUADRUPELD
Does anybody have a different awesome name?
right on vivix
Vivix, handguns are made to kill people... sounds like a nice bit of propaganda
I'm thirsty
hey guys, what's going on?
:p
Hi guys
MelaPonie: It might be, read above. I don't want to debate this because I'm unreasonable about it
dat troll spec , i think
Serenity: Maybe you should drink something.
xD
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
OH COME ON!!!
Vivix, yeah i saw it
lololol
AJIsAwesome:Nothing inside the house to drink
THIS IS MY NAME DONT YOU DARE STEAL IT
Vivix, wasn't debating, mearly discussing
demeyes are staring into my soul
HUZZAH! THE SPECTRUMS HAVE BEEN QUINTUPLED!
yeah, but you know what I mean. I say stupid things, uneducated things, and people get angry
Spectrum_Speed: So you say :P

Nooo
Spectrum_Rush: is too
:3
BB hurts, Paintball is better
BB Guns and Paintball guns.
It hurts too, but atleast you can't say "NUH HU; MISSED ME!"
Thanks for the idea.

Push pull pots are a bitch to wire... I'm so confused-
ok
Soap Vivix.
not sure if soap is a band
Nuh huh! That wire deserves that name!
http://derpy.ponychan.net/chan/files/src/134565550140.jpg
Fine you get away with it this time.
WOAH--
Wired it wrong, turned on amp and it justs SCREAMS noise at me
your point?
I think it doesn't like its new name Vivix.
http://derpy.ponychan.net/chan/files/src/134565306000.png
Yeah..I'm sorry wire
O.o what is he doing with RD :s
something
but yeah each tap pickup has 4 wires going out of it, into a 6 terminal push pull pot- and since I don't use the covers on these guitars, I've accidentally ripped asunder its inside with my beltbuckle
Smart.
ripped asunder... nice grammar there
I know, I'm a genius
Pure genius.
/me cries
/me comforts vivix
/me glomps Vivix
Now what do I do..I have no idea what's going on inside here
hehe
Aww thanks you two
mhmm
Jmo: glomps?
tackle hug
Sonova.
I type fast
/me appreciates said skill
mhmm
and/or ikr
its at least 130 words per minute
I wish I could type that fast...
I used to have a really high words per minute read, with information stored- You know those tests
but I haven't tested write or read spee din ages
The only thing bad about my writespeed is that I hit space off beat, so I destroy words- and the anti ghosting ruins my T's often
Well for me it depends on what keyboard i use and all
I want a ps/2 mechanical keyboard
finally i can have my name without being bothered by tabfails
soo deliicious
dat deliicious
yeah, I can only type fast on my keyboard >.>
ah its good to be me
lolbegtodiffer
o u
I tried modern typespeed on an old typwriter, instantly jammed
Spectrum_Rush: IKR? He jsut got bored and left
and imagine how hard it would be to erease all those typoes-
heh
Vivix lol
*just
all dat white out
Hehehe
Spectrum_Rush: Well the person was a douchebag tbh, Claiming his brother made that one drawing at first, And possibly taking credit for the one with twillight and the AAAAAAAAAAh face
Vivix: I LOVE typewriters. My grandmother still has one.:)
Ponies47: ikr, changed to Rohan so i wouldnt be bothered
! Cool, I really like how they feel to type on
If I tossed a typewriter at you Vivix, would you still like them?
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw224_9658_-_angry_pinkamena_diane_pie_pinkie_pie.jpg
exactly wwhy theres a typewriter add on for ipads...
what song is this
Jmo: Well..I would like IT, but I'd be pretty cross with you ;__;
Spectrum_Rush: I noticed. You should keep that as a alt or somthing.
You could never be cross with me, don't be silly.
05this is one of the few metal bands i know that features a black singer
I know..I'm sorry

The merry minglers, 40s acapella
Dark_Horst: It's good! :O
Ponies47: Don't worry If you don't know, but thanks anyways :)
Ponies47: HELL no

I only drink rooot beer with real sassafrass root >.>

Dark_Horst y u no like root beer?

Dark_Horst: It also depends on what root beer you drink.
i also presume i somehow managed to by the cheap shit
not vanilla flavoring though
I drink root beer with vanilla ice cream on top. ;3
Dark_Horst: To me it is. My mom thinks it tastes like tooth paste
/me *snapflash Wouldn't you like to know Ponies47 *snapflash

Safran!? I was amazed at how Safran is still that expensive. It's like..1500 dollars for a kilo safran in NOrway
i drink coke
I like the stuff that supposedly gives you cancer
Spectrum_Rush: What just happened O.O
?
Ponies47: My mom says that about Dr. Pepper
sassafras
Woah nice music
I drink Barq's root beer with a little bit of vanilla ice cream sometimes. Mostly just Barq's by itself.
i actually have pretty tolerant tastebuds. i can drink all sorts of energy drink (except red bull)
05hows that?
Gold_Demona: I love this Dr. Pepper!
Ponies47: what do you mean? :S don't know what you're talking about

Vivix: I used to take the nuke general in C&C generals zero hour and just take a huge map and build a huge huge huge amount of nuke silos and infinite money cause of hackers
because whoever fired first was most likely goign to win, right
killerpony7733: Vivix http://www.dark-circuit.com/random/data/media/3/ion%20cannon.jpg
Ooh, yeah, Generals was cool too
05ANTHRAX WARHEAD IN PLACE
hehehe
^ of course, Wrek
Wrek: BEHOLD THE BRINGER OF LIGHT!
/me is drinking tea
CnC was fun..
it was the first eh..rts I played
probably one of the first games i played A lot-
I still have my first decade and C&C 3+kanes wrath etc
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3lwbkcYmC1qdmo63o1_1280.jpg
The first game I ever played that I put more than 500 hours into is Simpsons hit and run
Yeah I bought First Decade too, because back then I only had demo
!
Infact, it still holds that record to this day
Nice
I have played no other game more than 500 hours :s
I think the game I've played the most over the years..must be fallout
Vivix: Oh and theres a huge fan made patch for first decade fixing having to use a CD etc etc etc
oh, nice
Vivix: remember the renegade game?
Yeah!
That game still has a small but very fun online community
I was so dissapointed that it wasn't RTS. I thouht it was like you could take controll of a soldier while playing- but yeah
the mp was fun, and it was fun on itself, but yeah I thought it was RTS + fps
Vivix: But yeah for a RTS ish FPS hybrid it's hard as heck when online cause you need to be smart and everything and use tactics
yeaah
I think some source mods tried that
Back. Sorry about that. I'm home alone and I'm looking after 2 cats and a dog. :P
I remember one where Team A is run by RTS dude, one dude, with AI and shit. And Team B = players who run and hide and like.. rebels
Seriously stealth black hand with a group of 3 or 4 setting up nukes and succeeding is just......AWESOME
11,01Hi Ponies47
Hi Nittany_Discord :3
Hehe, I was never able to play Renegade a lot online- mainly because back then we had ISDN
Welcome back Ponies47
Thanks MLP_Brovakiin :3
My closest rival to 500 hours by the seems is Diablo II, with around 400
Ponies47: Welcome back!:)
Thanks AJIsAwesome :3
I can't count hours on my games- too long ago and too big a timespan
but I'm guessing longest I've played is fallout-
Vivix: The patch i told you about helps with that, But yeah god renegade is so much fun when you begin using teamwork and smart tactics. I can't tell you how much adrenalie you feel rush to your head when you manage to quickly take out their buildings with nukes or c4's
I don't think any of my steam games have passed 100 hours
hi everypony!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

/me puts Nittany_Discord in a maid corset and pulls the strings
Nittany_Discord: you are now more sexy like
Vivix: Very much so, Haven't checked as of late, But once you get your patch through and all i believe on certain times on certain days a server is usually quite crowded
11,01Thanks Bronysith.
Theres downtime of course but when you get on at the right times they are really active
Ah nice, might try to do that. I still play Opposing Forces and Half Life dm after all, now and then
alot of old mp games are a lot faster and more fun for me-
/me gives Nittany_Discord a box
11,01Is it a box of happiness?

00,10still did't realy get much for it Chrysalis
Dying of crying after reading my little dashie :'(
>.>
I generally delete crates on pickup.
IKR Spectrum_Rush
I hear that that was terribly written
oh for fucks sake
00,10stickie jumper, cloak and dagger and pyros new bubble blower thing
IKR Spectrum_Speed
there are sadder things then my little dashie
Im one of those, Spectrum_Rush
sorry rush
Spectrum_Speed: Overrated fic is overrated.
It's not the best, but people rack extra hard since it was so succesfull everyone was forced to read it
Fuck you Meanwhile
Meanwhile: thank you
I never read it because Human in equestria or pony in humanworld is not interesting to me
/me slaps Spectrum_Speed around a bit with a large trout
/me was the one who said it was horribly written
Pfft. Best answer I've ever received for my opinion of MLD.
Fuck you Wrek:
Hahaha
oh, yeah I agree as well Meanwhile
Wrek you still working on that?
if you want sad read eternal
i agree too Meanwhile, i mean it attempted to be emotional and i can see how it would be to some people, but i didn't get sad at all
BronyInstrumental lol
What song?
Meanwhile: MLD? I wasn't sad at all. I don't cry at stuff like that.
Totally ruined Eternal for me
00,10got too damn many strange market gardners
Meanwhile: I agree. It's too overrated.
ah, so I would probably laugh at it, meanwhile
Eternal wasn't that sad for me at all :/
I just read it off my phone
I didn't want to read it
Cliche or not it did evoke a level of emotions
welcome SlurryMoon
Sumica: the amount of market gardeners is TOO DAMN HAI!
What were you aiming for Sumica?
the bullseye
00,10somthing not market gardner
I'm not saying it was the best thing ever, but for a fan fic, surprisingly good
Pfft.
00,10or even somthing not melee
I have no trouble with MLD, I just didn't read it
Anyone alive?
MLD is a good fic, but it's not the best. There never can be a "best". People have different opinions.
Where will you post this picture when its done wrek? I wanna look at it
'MURICA
AJIsAwesome: yes, true
00,10if soldier was ment to melee he would be in skyrim
AJIsAwesome: tell that to humans
11,01I have three strange weapons. They don't have many kills on them since two are melee and the other seems to be a crappy scout weapon (and I don't play Scout often).
For me, for instance, best fic ever was FoE, but I know plenty of people don't like it at all. Which is fair enough
What's the scout one Nitt?
11,01Shortstop.
so... its grass?
HE COPIED AND PASTED :O
its fine
Vivix: Fallout Equestria?
Yeah
That's- my personal favourite
mine too
00,10never liked fall out
11,01Yeah.
Me neither. It's just not very interesting.
I just hated fall out
Aww
Well, I only like it because Im a massive fallout nerd...
Yeah but I see you in mane anyway. :P
but yeah see, none of thoe points are invalid
Vivix: It's not my cup of tea. It's nice considering that it's a well attempted crossover, it's just too much for me.
Yeah, so- that's why we can't have a best in music, art, or anything. Too many different likes
again, tell that to humans, vivix
*insert any award show here*
Hi bronystate.
Vivix: I wouldn't say that. There can be personal likes as well.
Hehe, it's--fairly ignoreid I guess, but "best" is just a digure of speech most of the time
FillyFlam: Hello!
Oh yeah, of course
HOLY SHIT that picture is going well
Hi FillyFlam
hey FillyFlam
Hey FillyFam
Hallo FillyFlam
Hey FillyFlam! :3

BRB got another suscriber who wants to talk to me

BronyInstrumental: Beeeeecause? :P

I wonder how she lost that leg.
Eat stuff

Meanwhile: pirating
Doho

Ohello Meanwhile!
Allo MadSurge.
Meanwhile: The details are very good
Vivix: at piratebay?
Hehe, yes
Meanwhile: how you doing man?
http://derpy.me/9uRtI
MadSurge: Average. How 'bout you?
CCCP: Awww :3
/me glomps Meanwhile
what haven't we ponified yet?
Golakka it wasnt an artist panel
Sumica: if i was any good at rocket jumping i'd trade you something for a market gardner
it was a bronystate panel
Meanwhile: went to BUCK :$
MadSurge :3
hi Meanwhile
MadSurge: Oh cool. How was it?
GilDash|Gaming: still thinks im a cunt
MadSurge awesome
and Chrysalis was in the front row :D
Golakka: You *are* a cunt. XD
Meanwhile: had a lot of fun and met with people from the chat and Ponygoons :)
Golakka i was in the front row
Ruth has an awesome quote from me
then i ended up on the panel
MadSurge: Wonderful.
"I am like Robin Hood, But a cunt"
XD
If I had any reasonable source of income, then I would've gone there >.>
steal from the rich and you steal from the poor
i hope the panels will be better explained next year. i didn't know all bronystaters were allowed up to the panel :D
then spend it on ponies
Chrysalis: That's the Scottish way. XD
I was tempted to jump up on stage
CCCP: What was the image? I'm really curious now- they almost look like explorers around Egypt-
but i couldnt be fucked
fucked = bothered?
cowvarkian: Pretty much
Golakka: Why? Did seeing us being crucified stop you? XD
In this context, yeah.
GilDash|Gaming its also the government way
Nah, I needed a shit
Vivix it was some World War 1 image, they were some old Gas masks, wish i had more information on it
GilDash|Gaming: how were you crucified?
when you realise just how much the government take in taxes
CCCP: Aah, cool
you realise why some people refuse promotions
BronyInstrumental: Let's just say it was a tough crowd. XD
Wrek: Can you zoom out so i can see your picture?
and tbh GilDash|Gaming, I was too buisy to go on stage
05Golakka
05so far so good
Wrek

Oh my word, Get me a towel
You can zoom in again
Golakka: So was I! I had to guard the stairs!

Hey, guys what's going on in h-
i had to be all visitor and stuff
\OH LORD

Bugger off Chrysalis

MadSurge: ikr 6_9

I was actually the stunt double in that film.
kirzstryfe: thats supposed to be Meanwhile ?
kirzstryfe: How was the Lorax movie?
I'm a pretty good actor, or so I'm told. Hell, I just got a lead role in a show I didn't even audition for
a small orange man, with a magnificent mustache?
pretty good actually, have had it playing at for for 2 weeks now
*furry man
kirzstryfe: thought for sure that this is Meanwhile http://www.ninjatown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/nt-moustachio1-300x300.png
how'd you accomlpish that, SonofaTimePony
Bronysith: don't you see the BEAUTIFUL MOUSTAAACHE? :D
Guys after hes done with the tail(mane) Hes done with pirate rarity!
:D
kirzstryfe: Ok. I've heard it's animation is great, but it's story is terrible.
6_9
*accomplish
Pirate Rarity is amazing
The director knows me and she called me up, told me she had an empty role, and said she would like me to play it
Bronysith: WE NEED TO GO DEEPER.
I feel like a famous actor
what play is it?
Did he draw her horn?
Chrysalis Any Rarity is amazing
AJIsAwesome: the original Dr Seuss tale is better I heard :D
*its*
not as good as luna though
the message behind the story is that explosive expansion at the expense of the resources and the world itself is a bad thing
Wait Until Dark
Rarity > Luna :3
wanna *smiles* see the most spam ever?
THIS WILL GET ME BANNED
So don't do it. ¬¬
Nah
I'm not really too sure what it's about, but I know my character is a con man trying to steal a doll full of heroin
Spectrum_Speed: Don't be dumb.

hehehe
Indeed
