How else do you explain all the bad latin?
13might be the motorcycle..

That doesn't happen until at least year 5...he's still 11 right now and probably still believes in cooties :P
*badumtish8
But it's not!
It may even be the 70s
13like 87
fox news tells me that everyone whos a democrat lives in newyork
Yeah
Yep!
bwahaha
some of them even had to suffer through 95!
I just remember 3.1, hahaha
hey 95 was a great year
If he was born in 87 he would be 11 around 97.
First year is 1991
When Solitaire was the most complex thing you ever though computers could do
or something
13really?
13win2k was their best work
Wiki say Harry was born 31 July, 1980.
13that was horrible
13hands down, no contest, wipe it from history horrible
win98SE was amazingly good... after it was fully patched
zAmen haa
13and now from that inertia it's hard to push them to 7
whoa everything is empty i guess rolox is huanted
I watched Toy Soldiers earlier today, and in that movie they show a CRT monitor with IE 5 or something.
Also an advanced military proccessor in that movie had 600 mhz Xd

S3 spoilers?
then goes and fixes the problems with the next one
"Oh."
"Well... crap"
13linux is still most at home in server land
inorder to get in his house just say " we know about the sorcerers stone"
ahaha
13linux changes fast but it also has severe usability issues coming from its unix heritage
and there's the WinME reference
13like single programs being scattered in four different places
POSIX advantage, everythings a file, but it also is one of the biggest weaknesses
I've used Ubuntu and Mint, really liked both, but had a lot of problems with trying to get compatibility with my different windows-based games, even with WINE.
case in point, the ageing, horribleness that is x11
13for me and debian at least, i do like that you never need a restart except for kernel upgrades
No one catches the "not the bees"
Mabye it was made before hand
13Malk: this is like 2007
13FIM wasn't a think
13i tried making ubuntu my main on laptop.. it failed miserably..
13more like consistency... it's all POSIX standard but you don't have consistent direction across critical packages for the OS
13i remember wrestling for hours trying to get it to accept the wifi card
13mint is descended from debian right?
13so far out of the distro families i've tried i like debian the best
Oh it's a repeat.
Mint is derived from Ubuntu, which is derived from Debian, IIRC.
Debian is nice, because debian is stable
things get really ugly when you start getting into experimental trees, like gentoo
How about ArchLinux?
Wht's with the commentary???
Ok
Well they did intend for it to be advanced from the start.
its a nice middle ground if you want to get into a more cutting edge distribution, but don't want the headache of compiling everything
Its still a work in progress
o_o
2 hours???
Only 2 hours?
13^
How much resources did you allocate for the vm?
Hmm
13^
13i have an xp vm for journeyman project 3
I knew there where two...
13i used to have a 98 ISO from MSDN that i vm'd but i think i lost it in a format some years ago
I've only seen gameplay from 1 and 3...lol
13third one is the only one i know cause there was a demo for it on riven cd 4
Yep, I remember the demo from Riven
heh packard bell
Good Old Games has both Journeyman Project 2 and 3 available
I haz msn browser
for sale, and gog release include pre-configured vm environments to make it easy
DAMNIT!

00,02Barbetos, odd film choice
Honestly, Joshihollywood (de Tumblr) said it best: these movies are highlight reels of the books.
It came out around her birthday, and it had a convincing enough advertising campaing I guess
00,02this movie alone is good imho
00,02it only breaks down when you bring continuity into it
00,02though tbh things did kinda just 'appear' in the last book

but MAAGGGIIICCC
ANd the PLOT demands it!
Or you know, go back a room, steal the brooms and fly over
00,02the pieces that is
Why is ron good at chess makes no sense
13AND HOW YOU PLAY IT
Is it bad that all I can think when the queen approaches Ron on his Knight is "Hm. Yes. Quite."
YOU BROKE THE RULES
00,02XD
00,02and then rifftrax mentions the path
13he didn't get capped
It's the heat

00,02wait
00,02but his throat doesnt?
Nah. I wish.

00,02Do ho ho

13there's the xmen riff i mentioned earlier
in which case, Twilight is the other bishop by default
Like I said way earlier tonight, I am easy.
00,02rifftrax doesnt work as well on good movies
I watched the whole series 'round this time last year, and then .hack//sign afterward
and spike as that Knight?
13AdamTheDuck: it was "sorceror's stone" in the US because alchemy wasn't really a thing over here
13so "philosopher" doesn't mean "alchemist"
00,02see shizu's answer
I see...
It does! In *Britain*. In America, it's philosophy professors, studying Plato etc.

Can I request a vid?
Yeah
Sure why not?
No, it makes me hiss just to see the word! Nah, but seriously, gives me the heeby-jeebies
or do you think they can wait for the fun?
That would've been... I would've looked straight past Pinkie and Rarity and co., and said, "Nope, not doing this. Nope!"
How long has the stream been off?
I might have to fix that though
don't read it
DO IT
READ IT
DO IT, YOU WIMP!
NAO
It's the same thing, sorta, as that horrid 2girls1cup thing a few years ago.
I don't succumb that easy to peer pressure guys.
http://meetingwords.com/49Vfxuyaqo
comparing it to 2girls1cup is still bullshot
I lump it all together in the "Things I don't want to see ever" folder of my brain
That's how they're similar, that's all I meant :.
:/*
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4RyXvd0kjE&feature=g-vrec i like this this is nice
not even remotely
I'M NOT SAYING THEY ARE
I'm saying I don't wanna see either.
you just did
That's how they're similar from my point of view.
Was from the PoTC stream?
11,02Sorry about that, computer got blue screened :<
nah that neither. I got it as a suggestion when I was trying to name my Night Elf Rogue, it just stuck after that.
awww...
11,02:<
But at least it's gone, that's all that matters.
Yeah...true.
11,02No >>
I get blue screen commonly, it is because of lack of memory.
for me I mean.
Probably not though
11,02I have 8 GB of Memory
11,02Sorry, I mean I have 1 TB of Memory
11,02:>
8gb on laptop, 12 on desktop
I have 6GB on my labtop
11,02My CPU is a Lenovo and it runs at 8 Ghz.

11,02Maybe you should give me a hug :I
I give hugs to no man.
Maybe you should.
11,02Barbetos: Good :D Cause I'm a pony ^-^
Is making a Barbie Girl pony parody a bad Idea?
I want to punch someone!
No.

No it is not.

00,02what the
I played it.
Wii / XBOX?
Yeah it did
oh wii
lame
could of joined if it was the xbox version
Beatmania? Yea, Konami still knocks each iteration of it out of the park.
Cya guys in about 6 hours
I'm in the mood to kill some people.
Newer one
Yeah. Did not play that one. Planned on getting it but never did
Its not that hard
its actually a little fun
The pain in my hands after playing for a whole day straight
T'was fun though.
lol
gazukazuka it!
zug zug
Yeah. WERD!
it goes through features that dont appear until hard/expert
before finishing all the normal ones
'nother one down
lazers
this is just the beginning
Playing at that type of speed is murder.
TOO SLOW.
or daft punk

:D
:D
then get knocked back when you try a song
Yeah
Left, Up, Down, Right
these dont appear on anything below hard
11,02I feel like putting the middle of my fingers on the button instead of the tips is easier >>
and these also dont appear on anything below hard
Only nubs play under hard of course
this games a BITCH on hard
Yea, the ramp up in difficulty is crazy.
thats one way of putting it
they needed to make normal harder
EXCELLENT
and only appear on expert
Slide left right
dis song
PRE'E SLICK MANG
here we go
that demo in the background
looks
hard
Rewind
oh look
and back to easy/normal features
also, because you cant see it
the button actually glows on the controller
when euphoria is ready
Ye-aah Y- ahhhhh
unlike guitar hero, euphoria can be used after one sequence and you can hold up to 3
unlike guitar hero which activates after 2 and holds 4
Song goes on even if you mess up.
you cannot fail
The audience likes whatever you dish out even if it's crap.
yuuuup
pretty much
oooh

00,02because i'm too good in 0.16
with fitting music
00,02i knew i forgot something
00,02cant land on the mun without phasepony
hm... i dont know this part. still makkon?
00,02still makkon
00,02also this is the first launch that didnt explode
00,02will totaly make the mun
Hey ponies, I'm back
yet I must make TOAST
00,02now
00,02this version doesnt show transfer thingys
screw educated guesses
00,02THAT
00,02now that was awesome
Strangly the music fits very well o.o
did you hit orbit of the moon from that
00,02^_^
Dat Pinkie :D
Looks like it
00,02i'm in orbit
00,02about ready to land
/me applauds
00,02but first
00,02have to wee
music fit very well
Of course you do.
But first! BUUUUUT FIIIIIIIIRRRRRRSSSSSTTTTTT... I gotta take a wheeze!
00,02hmmm
00,02gona wait for a luna day
well i am going to be awayfor a few hours. bye
00,02imagine beeing these guys
00,02'sorry, you'll need to wait a month or so'
00,02'cant see where to land otherwise'
dat feel
00,02XD
Fitting music is once again fitting :3
00,02remember
Sudden music change is also very fitting o.o
00,02i've hacked together some wings
00,02tested them on kerbin
00,02can land on them
00,02also i have no idea if the ground is at the same level
00,02quiet in here
anticipating
Yup
00,02hmmm
00,02cant slow that fast
00,02heavy lander
00,02if this doesnt explode i'ma be amazed
00,02dat feel
how*
*yay*
00,02where is the ground
Below yoyu
00,02:<
down there
00,02usint a lot more fuel than i want to
00,02starting to see ground texture
00,02its close
00,02i've done it many times :P
I've only managed it once
I was about to land
00,02http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xcKACtKLnA&feature=autoplay&list=UUmMWwYyeQlZzbeynRJwCSGg&playnext=14
Then my fucking parachute fails and I die
00,02landings are the hard bit
00,02you cant parachute on the mun :P
00,02no air
00,02XD
00,02have to do controled descents like this one
from descrption
Horyshreet! KSP!
00,02this would be near imposible without
Also hi :D
05oh Iran banned Battle.net IPs todayu
05bring out the proxies!
00,02Wrek, odd, why?
00,02Serenity, XD
00,02Chrysalis, yeah
00,02derp
00,02Golakka, yeah
Do they actually work on the moon?
00,02winglets dont work
051 sec
BAD IDEA!
051. Promotion of superstition and mythology
054. Demonstration of inappropriate clothing and slutty outfits for female avatars.
like, <2ms
00,02Wrek, huh
Lol that 4th reason
It's a country
Next to Iraw
Iraq*
oh THAT iran
00,02close
00,02getting close
00,02very close
Remember, 10% throttle does not burn 90% less fuel in KSP now
i thought this was about some website xD
it burns 900% less :D
00,02wont need much fuel to get home
10% throttle doesnt use 10% fuel drain
00,02still using more than i want to
it uses 1%
You should get mechanical jeb, if it still works
<.<
sure
why not
They used to...
00,02nope
slower!!!
thats good :D
00,02FSCK YEAH
this looks manual
SUCCES!
FSCK?
nice!
touchdown
Nice :3
00,02i was manually piloting it
NOW DO AN EVA!!!
00,02cant eva :P
00,02demo version
Appropriate music!
Omg
daww
00,02i've got the full version but wanted to try demo landing
Night gentlemen.
05it was announced on the news in Iran
05those were the reasons posted
00,02Serenity, nothing
You did all this on the DEMO version?
00,02yeah
Amazing.
00,02Wrek, interesting
00,02i'll take a look at that after returning
00,02HOME TIME
Nice camera angle!
00,02getting close to not enough fuel
If the schools can do it, anyone can do it ;)
However I have been to the mun many times, Once to minmus with an airbreathing SSTO
i doubt he has the fuel to make it back
Use as little throttle as you can to accelerate
Isn't he going in the wrong direction?
Is he using the orbit to get momentum?
Is he going to slingshot around the sun?
hot damn
Then once the momentum is done, he buggers off to home
Huh, how did he do that?
Magic :D
00,02turn aroudn mid flight
Quite a bit of luck aswell
05besides
00,02SURPRISE PLANNET
Hmm, that sucks
where did that come from?
wait, Iran banned battle.net shit?
The G this is gonna be
That's a pretty early disconnect.
00,02Serenity, kerbals survive infinite g
05Buytoast yeh
ahahaha
yes, but do parachutes?
00,02Serenity, i once hit 50 :P
05anyoen here read arabic?
00,02PsychoticDoc, somehow yeah
lol
05well i think its arabic but meh
It may be innacurate, but at least it gives you the basic idea
Yeah but how do you type the arabic into the translator? :p
05i know how easely it fucks up anything that isnt english
Just copy and paste
05besides its from an image
05and not text
Ahh
That would look awesome
oops
Parachute, NOW.
Nah, too high
that was to myslef 0.0
00,02you can wait a bit
00,02let the speed drop
I've opened my parachutes as low as 400m and survived.
05cause http://i47.tinypic.com/2lktnqx.jpg
Hahaha
Did...the parachute just explode?
Disco*
was that supposed to explode?
Rawhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiidddddddddddddddddddeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee~
Exploding parachute, lawl
00,02Nyst, eyup
Hah, those crazy Kerbals.
Explosives in everything.
00,02der we go
pretty
00,02i like it
Needs moar thrusters
00,02especially during take of
hai everypony :3
00,02the upper solids burn three of the lowwer ones off
Well guys, yet again i must walk to school, see you all around later today
Bahhh
I made a gif of Soldiers Colourful adventure
You can't
Well yeah, it's just that I can't tell the difference yet.
aw
00,02Nyst, ones bigger
00,02for the bigger parts
00,02gona have to try it again some time
00,02hmmm
I try to have several solid fuel stages; usually one for each athmospheric layer.
Each row needing to take me past one layer.
00,02i've never managed solid fuel
00,02well
00,02i did once
Solid fuel is a bitch
00,02incredibly usefull
And a bitch to balance the weight power ratio
00,02not beyond boost on takeoff though
00,02it'll load in a minute
And fun.
00,02lets try it
That looks interesting.
Hi :P

I WANNA DERP
00,02no murz

00,02Nyst, dont have one
00,02Serenity, the have minmus but its another moon
Ahhh, okay
00,02only one body orbiting the sun
00,02its easy to get to minmus
00,02anything mun capable can probably do minmus
WHEN IS IT GOTING TO FUCKING START?
NIGGA STOLE MY NAME
I hope more planets get added soon. Murs, Kobos and Keimos, Maturn and rings maybe?

/me hugs while vacuuming, vacuuming everyones hair
Sonova.
o.O
/me loves finding things
someones vaccuming my mane
Feels nice when it's not, no?
finaly... after 2 month I may finally finish downloading that Torren >.<
Torrent*
:O
holy--I'm listening to Blur for the first time since I was a child- and they're awesome!
05brb coffee
:(
05back
I was puttin it away! Plz
o.O
hehe, I still have more thing I should do-
Go messy.
/me nomz
best musix
Oops
and that picture
yeah, I also acted as his stand-in wallet xD
Haha, unlucky
05then imagine that someone somewhere owns a hand drawn skethc of this very image
No really
I need this framed in A3 on my wall
Bye bye everyone :'(
bye *
bye
When I was in school, our teacher would berate us if we used A4 to draw, everything had to be A3 or A2
I used A4 for paper aeroplanes :D
Hehehe
I was teerrible
They'd always go nose first into the ground, right infront of me
I made a plane that you threw upside down :D
!
o_O
The way i folded the wings, made a MOTHERBUCKING RAMJET!
nice
its stupidly simple
really weird ones- and it would print like guides
11,01A#?
normal two fold nose paper plane
standard wings
however, you folded the wings into the body
then folded the wingtips into the first fold
aah
you then throw it upside down with all the force you can muster
incredibly fast and stable
nice-
Oh my...
If I still had A4 I'd try that now
There are other people alive? :O
It only seems to work in A4
We're zombies and ghosts
phew
never tried it larger
I was scared there for a second
I think A3 and such is horrible for paperp lanes, too flimsy
A3 Aquarell mighit work thouh, that's really stiff
Ooohhh ponies!
Hehehe
Also A# Nittany?
/me is constantly wounded and in pain from tackles
05international paper sizes nitt
European paper sizes- eh A0 1 2 3 4 5, A4 is the standard printer size
(Cucumber melon)
/me just came from canternet.org
I think a4 is 27mm x..18?
I figured I'd broaden my horizons
Clearly I made the right choice
/me whimpers
11,01K.
I was the blueshirt that was standing watching in awe on the stairs
05Maid_Rainbow: how about liek this?
axel rudi pell bossmode
>.>
Good mornin'
Sorry
HAHA
05this gotta be my favorite ARP song
O.O'
Like that!
hehehe
/me backs away slowly and prays to Pinkie Pie
YOU.
THEM
Also I just wanted to say hi. I got more important things to do like homework I forgot to do and all of that shit. See you guys in a little bit.
05i mean come on
05isnt this an EPIC song!? :D
05^_^
It's about a fox?
S'nice, in a way
zalos
waitno
BURN HIM.
!
But yeah, I like solos like Nels Cline
like--self oscilating delay under it that fucks up the fuzz- noisy jazz
Not sure if you spelled it normally or backwards
05Vivix turned me into a newt!
It's a lie!
D:
HAY GUURLZZ
hehe
On my to-do-list.
I saw it with my much older cousin and his creepy grunge friends
It's the one with the murderous rabbit
And "A witch weighs as much as a duck" something
i don't really 'do' solos, i'm more partial to doing rhthm myself :)
Murderous Rabbit? Watership Down?
and the french
Is wreck still drawing?
Dat wreck
Nop, it's an astronaut^
Hehehe
That would of been embarassing
Oh you.
AGH I MADE IT WORSE!!
/me pounds face into keyboard
/me is mildly intruiged
The music is making this an insanely dramatic drawing :D
Rofl.
I remember when Neville Longbottom said that
I really like the seams-
I need to try colouring- I usually only do sketches, and then say "I*M DONE!"
Do you like the seams?
I looove them
they look like texture work for games-
I really couldn't tell.
I know, right?
mornin' folks
Yeah- they're really neat-
OILPAINT EVERYWHERE
!
hey guys
I'm good, yourself?
hey, that OC drawing, maybe i could try using SAI to colour that, see how it turns out
yeah
Tis good.
Sai is great at colours
I still kinda want Corel Painter, but- the dirty brush didn't work to me
Praise the almighty SAI
Aah
just saiyan
like a michal bay film...
hehehe
Explosions. If my movie is loadeer than the others, than it MUST be GOODERERERER
er
"MORE EXPLOSIONS!"
gooderererer.... seems legit
hmm
/me carefully walks into the channel "Is this a good place to make friends?"
G
You tell me.
/me "EEP!"
:3
/me *quest completed: Find a friend*
/me is rewarded +250 xp
/me has the tentacles of the ood
._.
Pinkachu.
:P
Soo Many Layers
whatever you say george
Sorry, I'm quite childish at times
Made me chuckle.
song is song

o.o
/me is being snarky
Song 2 is a song
:3
<:3
take drugs
How to draw; draw, draw more, draw
You may!
Afternoon peeps
Woo :>
/me climbs into Jmo's pocket
Well that's something.
Hey everypony
Hmmm... I think I have to add this to mirc...
nemnemnem
!!!
My computer
It's terrible
But soon, it won't be terrible
I just bought
2 fucking 1 GB RAM chips for it
/me has 8 gigs RAM
/me has 16
(Has 512mb)
o_o
Hehehe
Heya :)
umad
But unfortunately, my laptop has the worst CPU and graphics
i have 1GB can that play TF2
GFX isn't good enough
Is the smileys gone?
i cant see mine
You can run TF2 on 512
O.o
Yes!
When it was first released, you could run it on 256
/me gazes at the glory that is #bronystate in a real client
^
You lost me at W8.
xD
I need to get some more hdmi cables, and to get my other monitor back from my brother because he doesnt use it
D'awwww
HDMI Moniters?
And such an interesting place I have found
I still have a freaking TIME moniter
Even my TV isn't HDMI
>.>
o.o
wow
Oooohhhh movie night?...
:)
But before I can reformat shitbox, I need to copy over my files
Yeah, it only cost like--ehh 900kr wihich is--maybe 100 bucks? ANd - I had the money, and it would benefit my music software, so-- yeah why not
Huzzah~
Aww yeaah
Copying over 100gb of crap onto my ExHD
I don't mean to offend anyone but I have pretty good reason to ask
How is the owner of this place?
do ask
Hm?
Is he a real jerk?
>.>
I'm gonna leave that for others to say.
The mods are not bad
here
:)
Phew...
I've been here for a year, and I don't think any of the mods are dicks, mabye Sumica's characterisation, but heh
LAst place I was in was pure cyberbullying by the owner of the channels...
they have some wierd rules sometimes
00,10How dare you call me nice.
xD
Hehehe
haha
dohoho
it makes me relax
Well, he's probably gonna burn me for waking him up
But lets forget that and move on to greener pastures!
o.o
!
yeah
Saturn kicked me thismorning for showing my face in here
There's rules here, and as long as we follow them everyones nice
00,10Nah realy we try to make it nice here. Some times we have to be a bit rough with some one that is trying to spoil fun for others
welcome to the herd pinkie
Saturn is a huge arse to everyone
xD
Saturn is epic
05Golakka: yeah he does have a huge ar... oh.
I touched saturn on saturdya :D
I have come to claim all the hugs!
Saturn is pretty nice, a bit rough humour but he's never--MEAAN, you know?
xD
/me was hugged

Lol :D
Reading session time.

11,01Vi hasn't been in lately.

I'm not sure if I got a long with her, but I never really-talked to her
DAMMIT
I really may have been here for a year, I don't remember
>.>
When I joined, Saturn was still a basic member, not a techie, or a mod
silly memory why you no
Be here more often.
xD
Music?
:p
I'm often too busy to watch the stream
I actually stopped watching the stream alot after the season ended...
I usually watch movies, episodes and when they play games
WRECKS.
:p
i'm not the music man, i come from up the road and i can plaaaay~
I usually only play keys if I want synth in my songs, that makes for lousy practice
I know de piano :3
The piano, such a wonderful instrument, touches my heart.
You people make me wanna cry ;~;
Hehe
O.o
i think i've been here pretty much since the beginning
Waow
I was speaking possesive, as in "those methods belong to Wreck"
A REAL PIANO.
i've been teaching myself guitar and bass for about 3 months now
GAH
I've been playing since I was 14, soo..9 years?
I'm suppose to be reading damn it >.>
14 + 9 O.o =23?
:3
:p
23, yeah
5 + 5 = fish
loading....
W-r-e-k
I knew it!
I only play the piano if I want to. I don't like when people force me to.
2+2= 9
*when*
2+2 is 10
DAH
I need this on my wall!
:P

nice
it was £5.99 for a jack and coke
Nice! :D
Jack? Jack Daniels?
Drinking was always a waste of money in my eyes-
18 is drink, 21 is booze in Norway
I cannot drink beer
I think it's like that most places
it makes me vomit
In America. Us idiots have to be 21 to drink :P
I can drink at 19
Come to mexico we have tequila and you can drink as long as you are 18 or over
Go Australia with 18 laws.
In our country, if you aren't in public, you're actually allowed alchohol at the age of 5, as long as it's moderated by parents
k, bye for now
I think France is the same
Oh lord >_>
Erm
seeya sirgan-
in scotland...
I never went to parties, yeah- I just thouht it was- silly
00,10France has wine as part of a balence breakfast
the legal drinking age is 9
But 60% of all americans are the stereotypical dumbasses the world thinks we are and drink below 21 anyway sooo...
Also, before you all call me a drunkard, I'm not. I hate drinking, I hate drinkers.
05by the time i have enough money to visit

Well this is some interesting conversation.
Yeah

I generally delete crates on pickup.
I hear that that was terribly written
oh for fucks sake
sorry rush
Pfft. Best answer I've ever received for my opinion of MLD.
Hahaha
I dunno, while the writting was sub par it still had a pull somewhere
if you want sad read eternal
I absolutely have tons of issues with Device Heretic, I was never able to finish reading it withou getting my inbox bombarded by his damn blog updates
It's just cliché heartstring tugging. It has no real substance.
Totally ruined Eternal for me
00,10got too damn many strange market gardners
you subcribe to him or something?
Eternal wasn't that sad for me at all :/
I just read it off my phone
I didn't want to read it
Cliche or not it did evoke a level of emotions
the bullseye
00,10somthing not market gardner
Pfft.
00,10or even somthing not melee
Anyone alive?
MLD is a good fic, but it's not the best. There never can be a "best". People have different opinions.
'MURICA
00,10if soldier was ment to melee he would be in skyrim
For me, for instance, best fic ever was FoE, but I know plenty of people don't like it at all. Which is fair enough
11,01Shortstop.
HE COPIED AND PASTED :O
its fine
Yeah
That's- my personal favourite
mine too
00,10never liked fall out
11,01Yeah.
Me neither. It's just not very interesting.
I just hated fall out
Aww
Yeah but I see you in mane anyway. :P
but yeah see, none of thoe points are invalid
there aren't many people that play sniper on MvM. i can't see why, snipers are godly in MvM

Hehe, it's--fairly ignoreid I guess, but "best" is just a digure of speech most of the time
