pikorar: nothing but a synonym, no?
App|eJack: probably g1 ponies
08,01GilDash: it's just complexity theory on recursive algorithms using the Master Theorem
Champion_of_Harmony: we needs more boots to the heads. :)
08,01*complexity analysis

I honestly hope Nittany_Discord takes over the stream until the encore of Rocky Horror Picture Show.
who was streaming that g3 live action musical the other day?
/me activates element of muffin powers summons muffin basket

DA FUQ?
Shizuka: Cheers. :)
BRB guys, gonna go compile some Java passwords before I switch out the SIM card in my laptop. Then I've gotta upgrade my optical drive with some DDR3. After that it'll take a bit for me to reboot from the Kernel, but I should be back with plenty of time to finish up that line of HDMI script.
CARE DUDES'?
C++ is great, but C^2 is better
Good luck RAWRity

11,01Inb4 BearState.
RAWRity just like our cooking
08,01so someone dropped $10,000 on the JdL brony documentary
RAWRity: Nah, it made complete sense to me. I;m a hacker you know. :D
GilDash: he took a shower
and yet it's STILL more accurate than that fucking movie.
So will there be a EQD post about this "Care Dude" thing?
Hackurn: WHAT! THATS AWESOME
SIM card on your laptop? I don't mess with Laptops.
Hackurn: I bet it was Gaben
Hackurn: Really?
WAT Hackurn?!? :O
otakon: And you know this how...
GilDash got quite the amout of soap in my eyes though.. so im crying for nothing =I
Woah.
Someone has a lot of free money laying around.
08,01http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/257527888/bronycon-the-documentary
GilDash: bc he said he was going to earlier
THAT'S FUCKING AWESOME!
Hey. :>
11,01Dude, green bear is best bear.
:O
GilDash: you just did not notice bc you lack my awesome reading skills
Airpuff: Close your eyes *before* you apply soap, silly filly. :p
That's a lot of $
AND A BOOT TO THE HEAD FOR JENNY AND THE WIMP!
otakon: Or because the word "shower" does not immediately draw my eye. :p
Nittany_Discord: NOOOOOOOOO! THEY GOT INSIDE OF YOUR HEAD!!!
GilDash But the hot water is so comfy!! >.<

03anyone in the UK want a DS Lite?
03http://www.bitcoinclassifieds.net/ad/1944_Silver_Nintendo_DS_Lite__Excellent_condition/#
I'm calling shenanigans hackurn. Probably a troll.
03that's like $32
GilDash: I've got good reading ability
GilDash... No.....
We don't really need a documentary of Bronies IMO
otakon: I've got 2 windows open. Cut me some slack. :(
6why the name change though
08,01it's been going for 2 days now, and it's raised $40,000
12keep up watching 12 animes, 11 of them are spring 2012?
Hackurn: holy, who the hell donated 10k? thats awesome!
03because he's dumb? :P
12challenge accepted ;3
11,01$10k gets you a dinner with Q/Discord?
6you've gone through 2 in 2 days
GilDash: you are IPOSSIBRU
03also LOL
Nittany_Discord: I would think dinner with Tara Strong
03that is a butt-ugly charger
otakon: It bloody well feels like it.
03due to the UK plugs
if that was a troll he is going to getit if it passes 60k
GilDash but i just cut my hair today so I was showering like a noob.. xD I mean my hair useally made most of the water run away from my eyes.... not anymore.....
Hackurn: I know! see, brony community is best community, we raise money faster than the breast cancer people ^^
12UK plugs are sexy
Between Gabe and Notch I think we've probably got the bulk of that covered. (no pun intended)
6and the v- name?
12admit it
So.....................
11,01It's with the kickstarter.
08,01i remember Andrew (chairman of BronyCon) showing that to me before it was made public; i said he wouldn't make that much in a month
03XD
Airpuff: I'm not impressed. :D
08,01i was proved wrong.
02I was just seeing if I wanted to use that name, so that doesn't really count
Great now I think a boot to the head is gonna be the next best thing on bronystate :|
08,01panda: that... is worrying
QUIETNESS
IT IS EVIL
Get out your scratch tickets if you want the dinner XD
GilDash Im crying here! Show some respect! xDDD
11,01Top donation tier gets you dinner with JdL and Michael Brockhoff.

/me pokes
10k+*
12:3

6personally I liked a name name more than a "combination of two words" name better
Meanwhile: it would be so dense it would be a black hole
6but whatever
11,01Wait/
03same
you know, if they switch the name around with the DSi, would it kind of sound like an iDS by apple?
We need to make that into a meme here....
11,01I hate my brain on derp.
GilDash Pfffff Youre just jelaous!.. somehow..
1, Nitt. :P
I'm poor, so I get nuthin
otakon: And that's how you roll with the punches. I'm proud of you.
Finally typed that right :/
03I think that's exactly why theY DIDN'T call it that?
That video is gonna be a regulars meme isnt it?

Does anyone mind to PM me and answer a question about livestreaming.
DerpStar: aw dude, that's harsh. But you still have their phone number right? it's not like they're moving to Alaska or something right?

Well he's like a brother to me and my family
Oh, that's right. EA's charging money for DLC that fixes the ending, right?
00,03Well, looks like I missed a bunch of stuff!
Have a nice banishment on the MOOOOOOOOON!
Brushs Every princess's mane's
DerpStar: but you knew this day was going to come some day, right?
11,01EA's fault for the DLC and online pass. Bioware's fault for the ending.

00,03That's why I can't play BF3 :/
i kno just the thing to cheer u up DerpStar
Its sad, but it isnt like its the end. And more importantly, you need to figure out living arrangements.
00,03Online, at least
kirzstryfe: ur streaming right?
11,01DerpStar: If you need a roommate, I'm looking for a place to live.
Booze?
Scoot-Scootaloo: Do you play on xbox?
Kandarihu|H8s2Clean: no, it's free. Plus no one would buy it if they charged for it. That would mean they sold you an incomplete product, which is against the law under false advertising.
Shane377: he is

Might be a tad far guys but thanks
Luna?!
11,01Scoot-Scootaloo me too.
Scoot-Scootaloo: me too
Afternoon all.
I hate Virginia lol
You know, I honestly that if we're going to declare EA the worst gaming publisher, it would have to be for something more than just ME3. It can include the ME3 ending. And the Online passes. And the Origin DRM.
Scoot-Scootaloo: special edition?
Dusts XAX
/me bursts into flames and implodes, again
Heya XAX
1,3internet: ss or you're a guy :p
11,01Now it's "Used games are evil. You're stealing from developers and publishers when you buy used!"
I do live in a state that borders canada though.
Scoot-Scootaloo: see, you're going after this with the wrong mentality. To game companies, you aren't BUYING the game, you're LISCENSING it for recreational use.
Me and SuperBrony64 Californians :)
EA killed Westwood Studios
is dat some daft punk tron?
00,03Special editions are nice too~
Luna.
11,01"We're taking part of the game away until you pay us extra!"
WallDives: Upstate NY?
EA *is* the worst publisher. They have been since long before ME3
Kandarihu|H8s2Clean: Isn't that enough?
PrincessLuna: NOPE!
kirzstryfe, you must be using a waccom. forsome reason other pads dont get the "pressure sensitive" aspects in sai :/
Bungie kinda hurt me a little
DerpStar: i pmed u a vid
WallDives: Aww :(
11,01Even Activision doesn't do online passes.
DerpStar: Yes they did. I have never forgotten.
DerpStar: i hope it cheers u up
00,03It's like buying a tray of cookies, only you can't have all the cookies yet
EA does and it's stupid
bungie only made one good game, halo
Those things combined, perhaps it is enough.
They have singlehandedly obliterated multiple franchises with executive meddling.
Lol, I used to like to draw & write as well but it seems like I was only any good when I was taking a class for it.
And killed good studios. >_>
Luna. Just to let you no i tricked you with all this. I am actully... Your sister Celestia!
11,01DerpStar: I don't mind moving. In fact, I probably will.
we complaining about EA again? yay!
I guess I should say state that "technically" borders it. not that its at all relevant to DerpStar's situation.
superretroworld yea, but, the new halo looks bad
DerpStar: did u like it lol
PrincessCadence So you're a changling?
ohhh she got you!
Can't kill a money maker :/
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2182/
Yes Shane377 I'm glad to came back to your old name

*Transforms from Cadence to Celestia* How u like them apples :D
I cried my eyes out I haven't cried since Afghanistan
Am I the only one taking notes on his art style? XD
DerpStar: which one did u see me with before?
Well rember there's punch and cookies by the chatroom door. *Continues cleaning*
PrincessCelestia: That you're still a changling!
11,01Most major game publishers are losing money.
But as long as customers keep putting up with this nonsense, it becomes a winning business model.
Lol

YOitzGEEZUS: well... so do I, just not detailed. I just never thought of using the blur tool ^^
Maid_Discord: arent they losing bbecause of infitiy ward
Softek is more evil.
Maid_Discord: That's because most of them treat us like criminals before we've done anything.
What do you like writing about? ooo, at the gym or no?
most^
Crap....
11,01GilDash|Maid: Pretty much, and they treat us like money cows to milk.

11,01Ones that don't make games.
Fan fics mostly so far, i like fictional stuff. Probably some, and some on my own
YOitzGEEZUS: why would that refrain you? I make ponies on my lap top ^^ or do you mean, lack of a tablet?
Maid_Ponies47: There's Maid_Discord :P
Oh wait is it Maid hour?
I also might get a summer job
11,01It is.
yeah, but Softek never made a game, just held the copyright to the word "edge".

11,01Cool DerpStar
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3800/ OMG it sorta makes sence now!
I demand that reality fast-forward to whichever of the following events comes first: the release of Guild Wars 2, or the DVD release of The Avengers. I'm good with either option. :|
/me cleans DerpStar "Good :)"
11,01Airpuff can be a butler if he wants.

At least you're feeling better
/me irons butler outfits for Airpuff.

Champion_of_Harmony: NO! that will never happen period
But no defenestrating during Maid hour!!!
K then.

/me 11,01dusts pikoMaid
08,01i feel like i want to throw up
silly maids.
Then throw up...
08,01i also feel... not too great
GilDash|Maid: It is your word :) just making sure Airpuff knows ;)
08,01i'm stressing about the exam tomorrow
I don't know if anyone WANTS to throw up.
/me emties the chat for empty teacups.
Chucks WallDives into trash
08,01i don't feel prepared
But it would be the good terminator, the one that protects the people rather than kill them off...
08,01but if i do last minute cramming now, i won't sleep
/me is a sexy maid~
08,01PrincessLuna: but i won't
Hmpf... not sure what to do as butler..
08,01i can't revise everything i want to revise in an our
pikoMaid: Believe me, I've forced myself to throw up twice. I couldn't physically sleep without doing so.
08,01PrincessLuna: oh aye, yes

iihuioghuif
MaidWarrior: Ohhh... Can we cream, then cram? ;)

Maid O'clock already?
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4710/ when yousee it youll shit bricks
princessluna. i have a concern
08,01PrincessLuna: well, the thing i need to revise most is a theorem that i need to memorise, and it just isn't sticking in my head
/me is only up at this time of day *for* maid hour.
08,01and to be honest, i would rather take an overdose right now than revise. that's how i feel.
/me Gives Unnr a cup of tea "Indeed. It is."
08,01not to be melodramatic or anything
/me is up this time of day for homework... And GilDash|Maid.
Mops GilDash|Maid
/me is cleaned

08,01but when you have to memorise the theorem at the top of this, it gets rather hard: http://test.du.cx/master.pdf
/me shaves off all the hair from the head of panda for his ignorance while yelling "there is never a bad time for a haircut!"
Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeee
/me is bald now
/me brain explodes.

*Falls down stairs* I broke both of my legs I need medical attention!
/me cleans up the tide surge
But panda! I just gave you a lil' snip and a lil' clip and thinned your hair so it would be less scraggly and more dapper!
/me blocks Shane377 's kick before countering and beats him back in the trash.
/me hands Champion_of_Harmony OJ
/me does not like indicie manipulation.
6A.K.A. that really cool anime-styled B2W2 trailer.

Thank you Panda
Shane377: One does not simply hit a butler.
/me counters Butlerpuff and turns invisible
6ok so same one
/me runs away
/me feels head, "really? oh well thank you. But im still bald pikoBarber"
/me is watch Max Payne 3
Butlerpuff: No, they do it like this.
/me Grabs the invisible Shane377 and throws him in the garbage once again.

/me 11,01repairs Maid_Ponies47
Butlerpuff: shhh
/me heals Maid_Ponies47 legs
O_o this glue... feels wierd pikoBarber
Champion_of_Harmony: pokemon? like the new form shenanigans that are happening?
I only work with hair... I can't help...
Thank you all for your help :)
Umm
Who added me on Xbox ?
What so you mean walldives?
blech.
im soo fucking tired
Champion_of_Harmony: Pokemon Black & White 2.
NOW WHERE'S Shane377!?! :[
Brb one second
CCCP Why not get some rest?
Yeah panda, that's because it's actually shaving cream... We barbers have too much of the stuff and I was just trying to get rid of it.
/me Takes off butler uniform
hello fatherland
Gunthler|Xbox: I havent, I dont think we play the same games.
/me activates the Monty Python Intermission.
cccp
03I swear, by those charcter designs, it doesn't even look like Pokémon anymore
LunaTheMaid: im too tired
That is better.
geez first pokemon black & white 2, then black ops 2, how many sequels do we need for a sequel?
03with the new creatures, new characters, if they didn't use Pokéballs still it would essentially be a completey new spin-off series >_>
hi Phobos2390
oh god....I would not have minded grey, in fact would have looked forward to it....but black and white 2? Thats like a slap in the face.
so you used it as the bonding agent to attach my hair to my head, :| pikoBarber
I added Maid_Discord on Steam, but he didn't really respond
Airpuff: Now, into the maid uniform. :|
not to mention it ruins conituity.
CCCP, Too tired for sleep? Seems legit
/me straightens the hair of CCCP.
Hey, how come no stream?
GilDash|Maid... Never! D=
Champion_of_Harmony: its because it isnt a remake, but a sequal (2 years after B/W).
:|
11,01Haven't been on Steam yet.
Who's streaming right now? Because I lvoe that person.
I didn't buy black and white.
pikoBarber: meh
Airpuff, just come along quietly ^^
/me forces Airpuff into a maid's uniform.
I didn't want too
Thats why I said it ruins conintuity
/me appears behind Maid_Ponies47 and grabs him and throws him repeatedly into the war and then throws him from a 3 story window
instead of blue, yellow, crystal, Emerald, and Platinum.
Yes panda, I did. Did I mention we barbers aren't very smart when it comes to figuring out what makes the best adhesives?
Airpuff: It's lovely and frilly, and it feels so comfortable. :)
xD
10>sees N
/me saves Maid_Ponies47
11,01I'm busy though.
Champion_of_Harmony: how so?
Airpuff, you look so.... erm.... cute! :D
I felt like they were running out of pokemon in the sinnoh region. let alone the Unova region
/me resists as GilDash|Maid is trying to put the maidsuniform on..
/me dyes the hair of Maid_Discord green.
/me licks Airpuff suddenly.
the B/W continuity is the same, and the manga hasnt even got to B/W...I dont watch the anime though.
Speaking of uniforms I have to put on a sexy marching band uniform tomorrow :3
/me 11,01hits GilDash|Maid with a rolled-up paper.
so I would not have to wait a damned eternety to get it from China
DID DID I HEAR A PING???!
Maid_Discord: Ouch! I'm trying to get things done here? :|
03I could send you mind
/me is watchin a 10 hour minecraft video
03*mine
/me got licked o.o
03and order a new one LOL
CCCP: Have another. :)
cccp now you did
Phobos2390: tbh, they are, they're done with making a large batch of pokes for a while.
11,01No. You're forcing someone to be a maid.
Nice catch! OmegaMaidtroidBrony! When he grabbed me he threw me out the window the glass cut my wings! I can't fly now! :(
11,01That's wrong.
/me finishes pushing Airpuff into the uniform.
GilDash|Maid: :3
Maid_Discord: He doesn't know what he's missing. :p
Phobos2390: C:
/me is in uniform.....
that whole battling past gym leaders thing sold me to an extent on Black 2 or White 2
/me sics the Metroids on Shane377
/me 11,01takes uniform off of Airpuff
/me takes it off again...
but I still can't stand the fifth generation creatures either
/me Sighs
Mwuahahahahaha
/me gives Airpuff extensions and braids them.
03yeah
03hacking first-gens in there is the only acceptable way to play
*Runs back up the stairs with bleeding wings*
Only two ways to kill my pets >: D
03or if you know someone who's beaten the game
03import yours to theirs and trade
I want moar Russia
With guns and swords?
Airpuff: Aw... You looked good in it as well... :(
/me stares down at the ground
Charges at Shane377 and bucks him into the wall at full force
WallDives: what I want is a Super Smash Bros pokemon game where you could map your attacks to certain buttons like in zelda. I would also like it if it were a 3d game. It would be a complete change but it would freshen the series up.
/me jumps up
/me turns invisibl
invisible
Watch out for the Metroids Maid_Ponies47
Grabs Shane377
/me kisses Airpuff.
wow...I didn't know that it would be that long
plus it proves that the people involved with the video games (unlike the TV show people) actually care about and acknowledge the fact that Pokemon existed more than five years ago
/me spikes up the hair of Phobos2390.
/me blushes
/me counter grabs Maid_Ponies47 and slices Maid_Discord wings off
WallDives: Huh?
I dont normally count, but when i do.. i count to potatoe
/me kisses GilDash|Maid Back
urem....
/me runs off after cutting Maid_Ponies47 wings
wtf?
11,01Ow.
03sorta, but they still restrict you from getting any older ones before beating the entire game which is retarded
/me pokes her head in chat
/me 11,01explodes
/me pokes it back out
Has no wings and can't fly and is bleeding to death
11,01Hi LunaTheMaid
Airpuff: I-I wasn't expecting that...
Phobos2390: they had a game ideal like that. Its been done, albit without the pvp interactivity. also, Masuda doesnt wat to do that.
Cant i defenestrate shane377???? =D
ive been reading this fml blogs, there actually really interesting
want^
/me give LunaTheMaid a super fast haircut before she has time to escape.
Cello Maid_Discord
lol wut Airpuff
anyway in the first game your guy had to catch either zekrom or reshiram because thats how you progressed through the story.
which is where the save dumper comes in
defenestrates Shane377. There.
03"Finally, no more Zubats in caves" *sees Woobats instead* ... congrats Nintendo, you changed a few letters, would you like a medal?
pikoBarber........I'm gonna kill you...
Champion_of_Harmony: yep.
03it's still the same game
I can hack my save file to have first and second generation creatures
03just different stuff
I would like to elect my dog to the senate. He could do a better job.﻿
Airpuff: You'll make a mess. You'll have to clean it up. And you'll do it in maid gear. :|
Airpuff: dafuq is defenstrates?
Is dieing on the floor and needs new wings :'(
CCCP: I could do a better job whacked out of my head on booze.
But LunaTheMaid... I'm the one holding the scizzors above your head. I insist you take this haircut...
/me takes Maid_Ponies47 to the medical bay
pikoBarber....Tonight....you die....
then in 2 they are somehow absorbed into Kyurem....how if they were with the frist guy how did that shit happen?
Maid_Ponies47: how can we do that?
Shane377 a verb for throwing something or someone out of a window =D
/me flys out from the front door and stabs Maid_Ponies47 in the neck
6Comparing bats in terms of names rather than in-game annoyance?
it makes no sence!
GilDash|Maid: ikr
not to mention a huge slap in the face by nintendo
/me knocks the scissors out of pikoBarber's hands
Don't nobody touch my hair...
/me turns invisible and slices OmegaMaidtroidBrony achielles tendons and runs away
03how are Woobats any less annoying
Has been stabbed and is bleeding even more,
/me takes scissors from LunaTheMaid and runs
WallDives: I was thinking that the arena would be more like pokepark wii. I would like it to get rid of the stupid four attacks only rule and have all of your learned attacks available, but you could only have 3-4 attacks out at a time.
03they're bats that show up constantly in caves
Champion_of_Harmony: they could have been released. N was borrowing a legend, it would make sense for the PC to release the other. or Kyurem coul absorb the power of the one N released.
This chatroom has become a battlefield o.o
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where are my Metroids? They should've siphoned your soul out by now!
03therefore it's the exact same thing, just "new"
Well LunaTheMaid... It was nice knowing you. But, I think you need an afro. *Gives LunaTheMaid an afro*. There.
lol Airpuff
........
6Riiight. Zubats were annoying because they were faster and could confuse pokemon.
/me restrains pikoBarber.
...........
/me 11,01dusts OmegaMaidtroidBrony
..............
03say what?
LunaTheMaid: Please, allow me...
03you just hit the Run button
3....
03it exists for a reason
3<<
6They're faster.
/me has been dusted and rejuvenated
pikoBarber: Come on, you... :|
/me is pleasently surprised by GilDash|Maid.
/me pulls our a razor
...did I come in at a bad time?
OmegaMaidtroidBrony; Thank you but I'll never fly agian because Shane377 took my wings :(
huh
no N was sticking with his because if you beat the game you seem him flying into the distance with his pokemon
rate your day! 0/10
that promo
03they're almost always much lower level than you are
/me shaves pikoBarber bald
is actually pretty awesome
JUST BEND THE SLURRY WOMAN!!!! (katara slaps him with the slurry)
My day 6/10
Maid_Ponies47: and i stabbed u in the neck
6Indeed, Chim. :D
but it looks more like a different animé altogether
pikoBarber: ... You deserve that. :)
We'll do to you what we did to Ridley Maid_Ponies47
o yeah I'm BAAACK!
03exactly
03that's my point
which I can tolerate
my day 4/10
Biglaw|Writing: Whooo!
/me slooowly backs away.
Waha! The joke is on you! I'm filled with play-dough and can grow my hair back instantly! WAHA!
Biglaw|Writing: welcome back ^^
03it's not even Pokémon anymore, so why do they keep calling it that?
Wb Biglaw
6Except it is.
because United States and kids
OmegaMaidtroidBrony: Which is?
I actually was playing Minecraft
:p
03>Japan
and OMG POKEEEEEE MONZ
pikoBarber: Playdough sets at a high temperature...
Japane too
Robotical enhancement ofc!
11,01Biglaw was writing in Minecraft.
Phobos2390: that sounds like a okay idea, but it isnt pokemon. the problem is that its a JRPG, and by default are formulaic. granted B/W's story is better, but the mechanics need to stay the same, less you risk alienating sales.
cutesy names and crap like that
/me gives Biglaw a Diamond =3
03they should call it Capsule Monsters instead :P
Maid_Discord yeah.... WRITING
If Nintendo really wanted to I'm sure they'd probably rename it
heh
pikoBarber, I have a flamethrower if neccassassary(Screw speeling)
/me wubs teh diamond Airpuff gave me
im sooo paranoid :(
Maid_Ponies47: can twilight give a repair?
03(that was supposed to be the name for Pokémon in the beginning)_
Well then GilDash|Maid, I'm going to need a lunchbox, some ice packs, and tons more play-dough.
then they'd name it CapMon in the US
(Is it just me or is nobody broadcasting anything?)
ATTENTION BRONIES: WE HAVE EXCEEEDED THE 40K MARK. GOOD JOB!
CCCP: why?
/me as Maid_Ponies47 is bleeding out Shane377 takes Maid_Ponies47 s wings
and people would think Capcom
and they don't want that
;P
YAY!
03you're thinking too hard
/me heals Maid_Ponies47
/me falls back as he sees LunaTheMaid 's Flamethrower o.o
Doctors got it under control Shane377 I'm now in the hospital wingless.
(Because I'm not getting anything from the broadcast to the left and I'm not sure if its just my end or not)
He's gonna get new wings :3
superretroworld: I ALWAYS AM IT SUCKS :(
MrBen: there is no stream.
pikoBarber: You'll have to handle the heat first... ;)
^
http://pentastudios.net/contents/games/wim/WIM.swf
AH. Okay, I THOUGHT there wasn't
welp, I'm going to get off for awhile, I'm going to draw some ponies....Later everyone! later discord!
WIM?
The stream is down, MrBen, the only thing that matters now is Maid Hour. Or in my case, barber hour!
LunaTheMaid: Doctors have taken care of me. But Now I don't have any wings :'(
I'm back.......how was HACKERS?
bye YOitzGEEZUS
The kind that require the Plasma Burn off!
WallDives: Fine, make it a spin-off game like pokepark wii.
03and the fact you still run around collecting badges
Dark92Enigma: mhhhhhhmm 5/10
CCCP: do you wanna talk about it?
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4761/
....
to all ponies
um
guys
Oh GilDash|Maid... You'll have to handle a mustache. *Gives GilDash|Maid a handlebar mustache.* WAHA!
/me magiks up new, better wings and puts them on Maid_Ponies47
when did Bianca have glasses
I meant to say Plasma Beam
superretroworld: NO!
drf
How did it finished cachi01?
Phobos2390: there is a spinnoff game coming in June. (pokemon conquest)
Ah. Alright. I was curious. The only reason I ask is because we've been having some issues here with my internet provider--mainly with phone and TV tonight but we've had intermittent internet problems and I just thought...
what's pokémon besides catching monsters in spheres
6So... G/S?
CCCP: sorry, just thought i could help
nothing
WallDives: And besides, it would feel more like the anime battles.
Renard: awsuuuum
Lawl
/me sets fire to mustache and extingushes it before it does any more damage.
Seriously, whoever's streaming right now is awesome!
Thank you LunaTheMaid
CCCP: Why is your day so bad?
03what about GS
3x3
That, you know, it might be something on my end. I just had to ask.
Thanks!
anyway when did Bianca get glasses
pikoBarber: I don't think so. :|
Anytime
Litwick: no one is
I CANT PLAY WAITING IS MAGIC!
03when Nintendo decided to jump the shark, that's when
Dark92Enigma: they manage to kill the davici virus and lots of wubs
That's the joke.
/me 11,01stirs SlurryLuna
superretroworld: its okay *hugs*
6Changed game mechanics, changed pokemon, changed characters.
Phobos2390: we need a cel-shaded Pokemon Stadium 3, with full gym leader/E4 rosters and different cups.
Litwick: face hoof
10Helps the new professor
Waiting is Magic?
ill get it just because ive been playing since I was, 10
00,03SlurryLuna... sounds like a kick ass milkshake!
MaidWarrior: it always is
03except, G/S didn't get rid of gen 1
Heheh
Is realeased from the hosiptal with a scar on his neck and with new and better wings.
03they were still there from the beginning
cachi01 and how was Crash x Boom
/me notices that Everlasting_Joy is not present, and is sad.
10Juniper
ScootaMexiMaid: You man kick plot?
CCCP: sounds like a designer drug
mean*
/me takes the clippers from pikoBarber's hooves.
03and not "Let's just completely isolate the thing so that you don't even know there WERE earlier games unless you were around for them"
Oh GilDash|Maid... I made each strand of hair in your mustache a pure strain of carbon that's so closely packed it's like diamond! WAHA!
CCCP: hug
DaringMaid: i didnt watch that
Dark92Enigma*
lol
/me sighs. "Ah well. I'll see him tomorrow anyway. Was just hoping to catch him tonight."
i gotta question
6Hey, G/S's Gen.1 was only available after the first half of the game.
Flys into the clouds and just forgets about the whole thing with Shane377
Alright, I'm out. Peace.
11,01SlurryLuna is a milkshake?
/me runs while holding scissors
WallDives: But is pokemon conquest a SSB like game?
03I'm talkinga bout the creatures
Shane377: lol
/me rips mustache off.
/me hugs superretroworld
03you still see Zubats in caves, etc
cachi01: didnt watch what?
6ugh
IF WERE ALL PONIES what type of ponies r we?
6what's this now?
pikoBarber: I'm not playing games anymore.
00,03LunaSlurry... sounds like a Slurpy!
and apperently something is covering the world in ice....lovely
x3
a wonderful discourse, of course
I would be a.... Gambling machine
!pokemon
Kosoveon, you are a 13Lilligant.
/me chases pikoBarber with clippers.
/me 11,01passes a LunaSlurry to ScootaMexiMaid
Phobos2390: no, its Nobunaga's ambition. SSBB is SSBB, different engine woned by a different company.
DaringMaid the ending of HACKERS
SlurryLuna x LunaSlurry
Ah... GilDash
6DRF commenting how he hates the new games again.
or SSB, rather.
MaidWarrior: dat ship
Maid_Ponies47: your welcome, i killed rd and cut off the wings for you, now you do the sonic rainboom
... Maid vs. Barber... The age old battle...
Yeah me neither
6which is fine, everyone has their own opinion
owned^
00,03Let's see if I can think of a clever pun...
ENGARDE!
wow, I cant type.
6When I said that I'm hyped for the game and didn't ask for his opinion. :/
pikoBarber: When has that ever happened?
00,03Sluna! Lurry!
If I were a pony, I'd probably be a unicorn
03I'm mainly saying that BW2 are so far from the original games that I fail to see why they're still calling it Pokémon
/me stalks Maid_Ponies47 from a distance
6because it's pokemon?
03how so, though?
Like, 2 seconds ago, GilDash|Maid, don't you remember?
6it's not what YOU remember pokemon to be
i would be a pegasus
6it's pokemon though
ScootaMexiMaid: did you hear about that new broom?
/me retrieves sopping wet mop.
Aren't barbers supposed to be in quartets pikoBarber?
.
03if I draw a random blob, can I call that a Pokémon?
03just by name?
6the basic rules behind it are thill there
03an d nothing else?
6...
If i were a pony, I'd BE A PONY
or alicorn if i had the chane
I'd be a sea serpent.
6no
pikoBarber: Back off or I use the mop!
WallDives: But that was what I was talking about. How would you like a battle system based off of pokepark's battle system?
hance
CHANCE
/me Conjurers forth two magic bubbles around pikoBarber and GilDash|Maid making them unable to leave it "stop it you two" *smiles*
03that anime promo looks like a completely different series altogether
Im baaack with TOAST!
6it would have to be incorporated into the series, you'd be able to catch it in a pokeball, train it, battle others with it, earn badges
I have a special mop. Its also a sword!
TOAST HERE
00,03Yes I have! :O
6the fact they're adding more doesn't make them /not/ pokemon
Its really sweeping the nation
6they're just expanding
/me jumps up to the cloud dat Maid_Ponies47 is on
That was long before the war OmegaMaidTroidBrony... My companions are all dead now... But i left them with mustaches embeded in their skulls.
Phobos2390: meh. I probably wouldnt like it tbh. if I want zelda, I'd play zelda.
/me looks at Airpuff with a sly grin as he breaks down the barrier and slowly walks towards him.
OH MY GOD
DRF
^-^
YOU
WE
WERE RIGHT
6different series, different styles
Whoa, whoa, whoa Biglaw! Toast leaves one big mess if not handled properly :/
THE NEXT TEAM IS NINJAS
/me shot
Superretroworld: WHAT! NO! WHY DID YOU KILL DASHIE! PRINCESS LUNA GAVE ME NEW AND BETTER WINGS! DASHIE WAS MY BEST FRIEND! :'(
also, havent played pokepark.
Back2school
/me says "hello,"and ties Maid_Ponies47 hooves and puts a bag over Maid_Ponies47 head
I thought the promo looked really enticing.
Later all
Bai xax|iPod
I just wish they come out with a new pokemon mystery dungeon...
6you can't expect a single series that's gone on for almost 800 episodes to keep the same animation style
Bye xax|iPod!
00,03If I were a pony, I'd be a horse
OmegaMaidtroidBrony I am aaster of one handed toast eating.
/me takes Maid_Ponies47 to panda
... Yes.
Champion_of_Harmony: I wish they would too, but chunsoft doesnt want to atm.
I'm anxious to see how that ties into the story
Maid_Ponies47: lol just kidding :D
/me teleports behind GilDash|Maid and kisses
/me and hangs Maid_Ponies47 upside down
If I were a pony, Id be a maid pony
WallDives: What? If I wanted to play zelda? I was talking about a more live action pokemon game. A deep fighter like kid icarus. With customizable attacks.
and Cheren as a gym leader YES
6and how is it that people complain about ash so much and they want spin offs again, and suddenly people are pissed that this is what they got lol
dammit
GilDash|Maid, this is not over yet!
Breaks rope and Flys away
/me slides sopping wet mop into Airpuff's face instead.
I better not catch a toast mess over there
03I never complained about Ash
03o_O
6not you
6Spin-offs?
6Of the anime>?
6but I've seen a lot of it
6->
03OK, well that's what I'm saying.
6yes....
/me jumps on Maid_Ponies47 and knocks him out
6like pokemon chronicles
/me gives OmegaMaidtroidBrony a bath
if i pony a were i were be a would
03you guys don't care about my opinion, then I have the right to not care about anyone else's opinoins. :P
If I do some pony is gonna get the bees....
03*opinions
6dude
6Weell, if it was more plot-heavy, I'd like it. :)
6I do
/me Smiles and pours some pepper in GilDash|Maids nose
6I'm curious how it's not pokemon
6because I just explained how it is
I was wondering why the baseball was getting bigger then it hit me
/me pops bubble with titanium alloy scizzors and uses super blowdryer to create a tornado that wreaks havic on the field seperating GilDash|Maid and Airpuff!
6your definition of pokemon isn't based on anything lol
One does not give an Omega Metroid a bath
03well it just seems like everybody attacks me for saying something
/me places Maid_Ponies47 in a impenetrable chair and chains Maid_Ponies47 hooves to the chair
MaidWarrior: I can not stop reading you as MechWarrior. :D
*One does not simply
Phobos2390: it sounded closer to zelda, from what you were describing, sorry. and what you're saying sounds like a concept or a tech demo. interesting, but not probable.
03and it's like, OK... so gushing over something is allowed here, but saying you don't like it is all the sudden not?
OmegaMaidtroidBrony You won't :p
6no, I was defending my opinion against an opinion that had no backing
03Yay no more freedom of speech
03>_>
Sorry didn't work! *Twilight Sparkle teliports me out* to a remote location
/me i see u got ur wings back Maid_Ponies47
/me simple sneezes as he is twirlled around pikoBarber's tornado.
13http://i.imgur.com/mXHiP.jpg
6I already said that people can have their own opinions
hai everybody im back
6no need to get butt hurt about me explaining mine
Its maid hour, we need to clean bronystate, not destroy it!
Hi EpicPwnTime3!
I love you!
03OK, well I'm saying the fact that gen 5 is the first one since EVER that basically elimiated the older generations altogether, unless you completely beat the game
6you know why they did that right?
6Sometimes, you have to know when to fold 'em.
6cuz that's also been explained 5 thousand times
pikoBarber: I love you. ;)
o hai EpicPwnTime3 didn't c ya thar behind that glorious link by Shizuka
Shizuka: lol
and the stream still isnt working, so lets all talk.
/me teleports with Maid_Ponies47 and just as he slips away, cuts off one of Maid_Ponies47 s wings
pikoBarber: Now let me out of this tornado. :|
MaidWarrior is right... GilDash|Maid... I'm sorry.. Let us work together as maid and barber...
MaidWarrior: that was already an hour ago
WallDives: I would either like that or a pokemon game where you could go to all of the regions (sinnoh, kanto, hoenn, unova, johto) and play through every single one of their stories in any order and travel between the regions all within one game.
/me ports back to his base with Maid_Ponies47 s wing
03I never insulted anyone
03I just said I don't see how it's still POkémon
Phobos2390: I would as well.
/me kisses pikoBarber.
Maid_Discord: its not gore play im just killing Maid_Ponies47
03and all the sudden it's as if I said something blasphemous
that would be massive and awsome
-_-
so if we all come together we know what to do
Maids do not like gore, it makes a mess
pikoBarber: I'm a lover, not a fighter anyhow. ;)
^
...
00,03Same thing, really~
6to a lot of people, this was the first generation where things were completely new. Earlier games kept reusing old pokemon over and over again while adding in their own, this was the first time that wasn't an option. PLUS it was based on a completely new continental region.
/me kisses GilDash
MaidWarrior: u dont say
11,01You're cutting wings off.
GilDash|Maid: bah, always fight!
/me eats toast
is there a stream atm?
when a daddy pony and a mommy pony love each other very much, they have sex but the guy uses a condom all the time and girl isnt happy about it.
WallDives: Then again, that would mean that gamefreak couldn't ever release another pokemon game again...
Maid_Discord: Who is? We have to go mop up the blood!
Maid_Discord: its only Maid_Ponies47 <-- has been a bad pony
03right, but that's so far removed that they could have just called it something else, couldn't they? :P
But WallDives, I'm a barber, and barbers are supposed to make people happy!
Phobos2390: again, you're right, thats why it probably hasnt been done.
6no
6because it's still pokemon
pikoBarber AND bald!
6Well, you commented on refutable points. So I refuted them.
03because it's the same people making it?
/me makes WallDives happy by giving him the long flowing hair he always wished for.
03that's really the only reason I see why it HAS to be called that
So
Twilight teleports back takes my wing teleports back to me gives me a heal spell and I now have my wings back I join the others and we just have a good time
pikoBarber: then do that. I just fight because love is hasslesome.
BALD! BALD!
What's taking place here now?
bai everybody!
BAAAAAALD
MaidWarrior MY EYES!
bie EpicPwnTime3!!
03people trying to make me seem like a horrible person, as always.
6Again with opinionated frictions.
/me begins mopping blood off of the floor, not questioning why it is there.
/me stalks Maid_Ponies47 from a distance with Maid_Ponies47 s wing on his back
This is quite sad to read
Next time, we eat........uuuum.............nothing?
6Oh, and new B2W2 trailer, NS.
Yes
03OK
/me washes all the blood off with a fire hose
EpicPwnTime3 Next time, we eat applejacks
I took care of it drf
pikoBarber: http://objection.mrdictionary.net/go.php?n=5763652
/me gives EpicPwnTime3 Maid_Ponies47 s wing eat dat lol
6Link above.
6in fact it's always been said that there's more than people know of
6Or I can repost.
6that is the definition of pokemon
03LOL
i beg yer pardon?
Next time, we eat Old Spice Shampoo.
I still think after a year's time that 5th gen is an improvement over the previous games in many aspects
and yet at it's heart it's still Pokemon
lol nothing EpicPwnTime3 <_< >_>
Biglaw: Beg ur parden?
OmegaMaidtroidBrony: that hurt my ears :(
OH! Ive got it!
He was lke "don't tell me what to do" and said he wasn't in a good mood for that
Sorry CCCP :<
6I'm not making you out to be a horrible person, don't get all whiney about that. I'm simply responding to why you keep saying it's not pokemon anymore
its okay :)
03OK
I told him I could always comply with that and ban him
Litwick my bad, Apple Jacks
so he ragequitted
came back later though
/me throws Maid_Ponies47 s wing at OmegaMaidtroidBrony for hurting CCCP
03I still don't see what his problem is
anyway...who's seen the avengers?
:o
03I completely forgive him for saying he wants me dead, but apparently he still hates me?
Well
/me is far too nice :/
Phobos2390 I have :3
that Game Freak kept the spirit yet evolved some of the elements is an accomplishment
/me is uneffected.
Just ignore it next time
don't reply
/me 6blinks.
Oh, OmegaMaidtroidBrony, you can be in my quartet... Please?
Next time, we eat POOOOOOOOOOOWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! [In a can!]
Aurora, I've noticed
/me 6sighs.
03*matter
EpicPwnTime3: XD
Maid_Ponies47: i burnt ur original ones tho
EpicPwnTime3 Next time, we eat CUPCAKES!
Alright I will
He probably doesn't
03it's still not OK to harass someone like that though.
WUB WUB WUUUuuub.
bah, bad luck.
03which is why I showed YOU instead of just banning him
and---and so this guy enters and i was like hey and he was like Bitch u like ponies and i was like YEAH WHATEVER
6the fact he has someone on ignore and still talks about the person is a violation of respect for any individual
03because that way it's a third party
/me laughs because he is all that is evil in the world
I know
03exactly
6that's what happened with sato several times
I'm back
03that's why I'm making it a big deal
6I would too
Biglaw: Yeah!
Oh eb PrincessLuna
GilDash|Maid! Join us in our quartet so that we may rule as barber and maid!
*wb
MaidWarrior Princess Luna gave me new and better ones I'm keeping them as a memory :)
Maid hour is almost over
03I just don't get what the big deal is
6I still think it's an offense that needs to be dealt with
00,03I have done nothing productive all day :3
/me shoots his M82A2 at Maid_Ponies47 and the bullets hits Maid_Ponies47 s hoof
I suppose I'll have to deal with this the unsavoury way again
03he's basically turning me into a mortal enemy because I don't like things he likes.
03which is the most retarded reasoning I've ever heard, tbh
OmegaMetroidBarber: http://objection.mrdictionary.net/go.php?n=5763655
03yes
Yes
/me walks away never to be seen again
Anyway, so is there a stream at the moment?
ScootaMexiMaid: Me either xD
6Weeell, if you reason your dislikes, DRF...
MaidWarrior: My orginal wings as a memory
ScootaMexiMaid I went to school, and answered trivial canadian questions :p
xDD
6Instead of saying 'it's not pokemon' and then say 'it's the same'.
Your way of phrasing your dislikes doesn't appeal to him
pikoBarber: Do you get barber/maid quartets?
oh well. least you guys have mad my day a little better.
6^that
ewww canadians
6thats something we've all told him
I'unno GilDash
6but he doesn't get it
/me hugs Airpuff repeatedly
MaidWarrior :O HOW DARE YOU
/me noms Airpuff
/me 11,01sighs
FINALLY someone drew a general Twilight http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Dor-dDiT8iY/T7LV-Aw_UBI/AAAAAAAAp0s/S69HEronk_k/s1600/186545+-+artist+einik+derpy_hooves+russian+twilight_sparkle.jpg
13i wonder
/me Hugs PrincessLuna and CCCP back
Maid_Ponies47: its been done theres not stopping what has already happened
dat link.
:x oopsie.
Helo evrybody!
00,03And it makes me wonder...
WallDives: eh ive seen worse
yeah if he's saying he wants drf dead or whatever that's just...overkill, even considering said person's personality
twilight_sprinkler: OH MY GAWD!!!!!!!!!!!!!
o.o
so have I, but shrink dat link.
UGH im so BORED! *slides on belly like Sweetie bell*
6that is the nature of opinions
CCCP: notice theres also a "russian" in the title for some reason :P
I'm not!
13i would like to see if i'm capable of streaming l4d whiel playing with people
00,03And the Forest will Echo with laughter...
Champion_of_Harmony VROOM!
/me Yawns
13but i would not want it to go catastrophically wrong
/me shaves Champion_of_Harmony.
Renard: thats quite epic too
isn't going to solve problems
Is it a bad idea to call impromtu a friend for no reason other than to talk to them?
is nothign palying or is it jsut me?
twilight_sprinkler: yayayayayay!
its L4D, it will go catastrophically wrong.
03what do you mean by "even considering said person's personality", are you saying it's less bad to want ME dead instead of someone else? >_>
00,03That would be the WORST POSSIBLE THING
hey no shaving
Ignores Shane377 and walks away with the main 6 with old wings in hoofs and With new and awesome wings on my back. There so awesome Dashie is even jelious :)
/me sweeps CCCP with brrom.
or you mean the streaming?
http://objection.mrdictionary.net/go.php?n=5763665
*mane
...
13i mean i determined last night that it's apparently fine with streaming l4d alone
no
03then what was that comment for
/me nomz GilDash|Maid
13whereas it fails miserably with portal 2
cachi01: oh he goooood
ah...
Gets back to work being a maid
I was speaking with regards to the nature of how you express your opinions.
Maid_Ponies47: u still have a 50 cal bullet in ur hoof
13i'm not sure if l4d2 is too much more taxing on hardware
/me makes a mess
/me shaves GilDash|Maid... Below the belt.
6I'm going to make an assumption
O_O
Barber time^^
I wonder if equestria knows about bronystate
stupid english class, i hate you
6just saying that's one reason why this is so ugly
Stop, Barber time
03and I don't even remember what happened last year
You guys, it's been barber time!
10maidwarrior everyone knows about bronystate
6...
10duh ;D
6how arti and i left for a month
03oh
6you don't remember that
6at all?
:D :D :D :D
03a lot of things happened last year :P
03I remember that yes
6you were partially involved in that.
6ok
Shane377: The mane 6 took me to the hosiptal and I got the bullet removed and now I'm all better!
This Otakon shippind song I'm hearing on my play list :D :D
pikoBarber: .... Really. In front of everyone?
I actually just found out about it a few days ago
this is getting a little ridiculous
*shipping
OmegaMetroidBarber: Aren't you usually OmegaMetroidRidley?
NO
Does anypony want to read my fic?
I equestria if wonder bronystates about knows
Yes, now let me get back to shaving your knees... Their horrific.
It's OmegaMetroidBrony
00,03Tell your friends!
Maid_Ponies47: face hoof but its a 50 CAL u would of lost lil more than a hoof
Comes back to chatroom and mops the chatroom ceiling
6everything is
Or ZetaMetroidBrony when Omega derps
It's still somewhat clean
well, its time for my daily beating in skullgirls.
In regards to it being a civilized discussion for once
:'D
03IS THIS THE PART WHERE WE START KICKING? </SpongeBob>
/me eats CCCP
IM GONNA BANG MY HEAD AGAINST THE PC
:o
/me bangs his head
/me heard zombie talk
Shane377: Forcefield I had around me stopped the bullet from going in to far.
http://pastebin.com/uETTtmau
6I suppose I'm crestfallen.
well I hope things work out with that
/me hangs up his maid outfit
!pokemon
Kosoveon, you are a 14Drowzee.
03crestwhat
ew
Sorry cachi01, but that won't teleport you into the internet... Trust me, i've tried.
pikoBarber: Don't you like my unshorn fetlocks? ;)
Walks to dressing room
Maid_Ponies47: i shot u with http://www.ssp25.com/images/usmc/gallery/50cal%20Raufoss%20small.jpg
Hello everypony it's chuggaaconroy!
wait what are you talking about Shadow
/me glues maid outfit RainBroDash's head
Ello Chuggaaconroy
and u pulled the forcefield after i shot u Maid_Ponies47
late to the party?
pikoBarber: OUCH RIGHT IN MY DREAMS AND HOPES
Shane377: That's... a nice bullet.
03well played
/me hides
GilDash|Maid: how do you use music in objection?
03nah, but that's fairly stupid
CCCPMAID: Nice to see you. :)
03"I'm not in the mood to listen to authority"
6I'm like a bunch of the people that've left or just stay on TST because of the friends they had.
That's actually a pretty technical term GilDash|Maid... Your knowledge of animal anatomy scares me...
Champion_of_Harmony: 'Cause I'm awesome. :)
CCCPMAID: Maid hour is over in three minutes
GilDash|Maid: what do you mean?
00,03Oh hey Chuggaa! Good to see you again!
Is back non-miad and is going to ignore Shane377 for the rest of FOREVER!
CupcakeWarrior: i know
6I don't see much a point in me trying to restart ye goode ole days.
FOREEEVVVEER!
/me hops out of the shadows of the chat :$
thats why i changed back
:O
pikoBarber: Why don't you some here and I can show you my croup, dock and haunch as well... ;)
That's because that's the past and not the present
O hai thar RaveBrony
Anyway
/me pushes Maid_Ponies47
GilDash|Maid: can you say that again? my chat went kaput
fine
drf, I know
Hiya OmegaMetroidBarber :P
03I fail to see how this is different then back then, other than different people.
Drake and I were lol'ing in PM
why try to remember good old days when you can create new ones?
at least
CCCP: ... Aw, no fun. :D
Bye everypony!
that's the way I see it
bye phobos2390.
indeed, what Kosoveon said
GilDash|Maid: :3
Bai phobos2390
I really hate how much i lurk in this chat :(
But yeah
phobos2390 later :D
GilDash|Maid Haunch :|
6Nah.
bye phobes
Champion_of_Harmony: Lit. 'Cause I'm awesome. :D
Need to be more Active! :[
07hm.
Hates Shane377 in the face with new awesome wings.
http://objection.mrdictionary.net/go.php?n=5763695
But drf, you really shouldn't react either
Alright, GilDash|Maid, no need to take it fast. I like it slow.
03I don't think TST was ever super-happy nobody arguing with anyone, I've been on the IRC from the start and there were always a share of conflicts with various people
Ponies47: calm ur palm
Because that's what he wants
Biglaw|Maid: What?
03so I'm curious what you mean by good old days
lol of course
GilDash|Maid nuttin'
as in, instead of reminiscing strive to create new "good times," so to speak
GilDash|Maid: lit?
I know Kosoveon
oh
6When the chat wasn't half DRF.
Biglaw|Maid: Did you read all the crap Shane377 did to me!?!
lol
I read that as "what, Kosoveon"
o.o
Ponies47: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3529/
my bad LOL
03^
6Or maybe he stifles it. :/
http://notalwaysright.com/dovahkiins-day-off/19832 BEST CUSTOMER EVER.
03That's the thing
The chat is dead most of the time without him, tbh
Champion_of_Harmony: Oh, I mean literally what I said before. :D
hay Shane377
Oh?
03I wouldn't appear to be talking to myself if people actually said stuff.
Shane377; and?
How about he keeps quiet for a WEEK and we'll see whether it's still being "stifled"?
It can go either way really
Shane377: DOOOOOOOOOOMEEEEEEEEEE
wb Ecco
wb
6That would be nice, NS. :P
07lol
hey VioletGreySha * hugs VioletGreySha *
03I almost want to take you up on that
Champion_of_Harmony: Type in "(tunes)" withough quotations, then a space, then your message as normal. :)
:D
03can I buy some tumbleweed first though
00,03Why can't I hold all these links?
Ponies47: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4761/
07well it's usually either tech talk or an argument
O_O
SL
OMG
I just realized
GilDash|Maid: thank you
where does one by tumbleweed, anyway?
Scoot-Scootaloo: cause ur only a filly?
03ebay
the music playing when he's vsing the ninjas
03where else
/me licks pikoBarber on the chin.
6kyu summarized what I was about to say ina full line
6Yep.
is a metal remix
I like how Kyu said that
Kyubree, and when it's not, it's more often than not quiet
Very
6Team Plasma music.
07and seeing the conversation
nice.
of Vs Plasma
pikoBarber: I won't be here long... ;)
I'm GRINNING
<3
07we could do without the argument half
And seeing the conversation puts people off?
*Hugs Shane377* I'm sorry I chucked you into the trash :(
Yes, that's true
6I was interested in that.
but
6The rest of the music was kinda blah.
6ok well
03when I'm NOT here, it's usually either gen 5 talk or silence
03:P
03or art
6Because guitars, guitars, everywhere.
03art too
half the time no one would talk anyway
well drf, that's not a bad thing
but
Oh noe GilDash|Maid... Then I guess we should speed it up! Hurry! Lick my chin faster!
the fact remains that drf is a part of the community and has all rights to talk
/me hesitatly hugs Ponies47 back
6probably because when you're gone we actually CAN talk about 5th gen
As does everyone else
6but that aside
03well Aurora
pikoBarber: ... I think we'll have to go further than that. ;)
/me hugs Shane377 back
word of the day: BENSON
Litwick: thanks for the excellent link.
SL
03you mean like how when Skylands and I were having a perfectly good conversation about how gen5 sucks and you butted in with something when we didn't ask you to?
6no, no wells, because most of the time you DO comment into a 5th gen conversation
03Yeah, same idea there.
Guitars aren't bad
6when you very well don't have to
too much feels like clutter
That ping honest to god made me scream.
especially when out of place
Lick my... Upper lip, GilDash|Maid?
anyway
/me lifts VioletGreySha into the air like the swan hold dance move thingo
Sigh, Maid hour is over
...
6No one else was interrupting that conversation you had, DRF?
I was clicknig through tumblr when..... PING!
imagine if Pokémon was actually live action like that
6I don't do that ona regular basis unless you do something like "be a pro and don't use 5th gen" etc
well I mean
6Live-action?
:D
Derp! I'm not a maid
the fights
:p
Shane377: ö_ö what you doin? :3
6the fact I did it I still don't remember what was going on
03I know, but you did in that case and we weren't even talking to you
i swear my parents know i love mlp
6Ah, real-time?
yeah
6I wouldn't do that know so I'm upset at myself for saying it
real time I mean
pikoBarber: Oh, sod that.
but they dont tell me
Shane377: Okie doki loki. Aren"t you gonna say sorry for all of the stuff you did to me?
a legit real-time Pokémon game
6*now
my mom knows, she laughs at me
I so want one
/me kisses pikoBarber suddenly.
VioletGreySha: just sharing the love
03that's something we agree on
/me kisses GilDash|Maid back.
6although one time vs 100 times
6Hmm, well, I'm divided on that idea.
Mine know I love it but um... it kinda makes me feel like less of a man around my dad though....
Ponies47: i gave u a hug wut else do u want?
although, PokePark is the closest to that right now lol
Hello?
07funny that you remember that one time, but can you count all the other times you throw insults into other conve...
6I don't see why I'm the bad guy
07late
Hey thar Deleted_Dreams
6Because pokemon is more puzzle-based than action-based.
hi Deleted_Dreams.
6I only attack when attacked, so to say
03insults and saying I don't like something are two different things o_O
SL
'sblood, next time we'll just split the channel in #5thgenhaters and #5thgenlovers and then a #5thgenidiots channel too, just so we can all mind our own business
didn't stop them from making pinbll
pinball
hello eeeeee3432
6True.
yes it was a spinoff
6the hell?
hey guys... look what i have here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JppPNPwFz_U
6why should a channel
Shane377: A hug is good. How about saying sorry for all the stuff you did?
03#5thgenidiots LMAO
6A POKEMON SITE
6be split
6into separate channels
6for that
03I think she was kidding
ohai Googlie_apartus45
Art thou a new pony to Bronystate, the Herd, or both?
note the bloody sarcasm
Shane377: a hug will do the same effect :D
03^
pikoBarber: Lie down. ;)
6so please forgive me and my rather sour mood -_-
seee Ponies47 u hear wut VioletGreySha just said
07see
I agree with roara :p
/me noms on Shizuka
So.. tired -.-
WHY ARE WE ARGUING OVER POKÉMON BTW
Ponies47: actions are louder than words
6I was perfectly happy until I walked in here
:v
grrr....
6again.
Hmmmm sarcasm doesn't need to be in a debate
6Because I pointed out that anime-styled trailer. D:
07this is why I hardly ever try to take a serious tone in here
/me gives Airpuff a can of V

Good lord!

6Night!
Do you know JUST how main offenses he's had?
Shane377; True. Well Twilight took away all the scars I had with magic. But now I got much better wings thanks to Princess Luna. But now I shall keep my orginal ones incase I ever want them put back on. :)
hi Shiny
07and DRF, just don't give him the reaction
Shane377: hahano.
pikoBarber: I don't think it'll matter because you'll be too busy performing for me to pay them mind. ;)
^
03well, if he has me on ignore, I still fail to see what the problem is o_O
Shane377: oh god WTF XD
6he started after he came back when we returned from our "leave"
haha WallDives
I've already warned him twice or three times, Kyu
LOL cachi01
03because he won't see my reply
6and he makes a point of doing this to drf
As in, PM warning
godammit shane, MY EARS!
Dark_Horst thus is the reason I hate sleep. Hours of just lying there breathing...
All I saw was the title. All I needed to see was the title.
Yes, what Aurora said
cachi01: WallDives http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qwRbOm2Pvg

But nevertheless, drf, you shouldn't react anyway

Well okay, GilDash|Maid... Whatever you want. But I'm going to need more shaving cream after this...
07but at the very least, I know he's just not going to listen to either of you specifically
He listens to me most of the time
6i warned him plenty of times too
/me engages lurk mode
trixie goes so perfect with the rhythm
6and I'm actually friends with him
pikoBarber: Where we're going, we won't need shaving cream... ;)

07I think so
Airpuff: I guess we'd find out, wouldn't we? ;)
Eeyup xD

Airpuff: Any ideas on how to break little Ommy out of his shell?
does gamestop take preowned collector's editions?
because
I recently traded a bunch of crap in including the blazblue special edition
and they didn't take it
6I don't think so

Airpuff: *Sigh* I don't think he ever will. I might just have to make moves until I get told no. ;)
otakon x pings
6I'd be trading in like 5 games
6so i'd get the 10 dollar boost
/me waves at GilDash from the corner on the opposite end of the room.
the truth about diablo 3
hey otakon
Biglaw: I so wish I could do that.
which games would you be trading in, rawra?
otakon: ping
/me waves back to pikorar.
6a few pokemon games, and a couple 3DS games
/me goes towards CCCP and puts gag in his mouth again "GilDash said no talking... right?"
02Pokemon Battle Revolution
/me loves having unprovoked anxiety attacks.
ah
07also, I've done a 25% trade in plus my 10% gamestop card and a $10 boost once
6and i might be trading in some gamecube games
6maybe
pikorar: If it weren't for your homework, you should be running. ;)
07was still less than toys r us
GilDash I've only had two lucid dreams so far, but I know I can get in control :D
07|D
/me proceeds to work on his homework once more.

07they don't take GC

6we don't have a toys r us around here
I wouldn't run GilDash... Why would you thing that of me?3

6well crap
Biglaw: I don't dream often enough to seek the signs yet.
03LOL PBR
03I want to get rid of that
6I dindn't want to sell those back anyeways
02Same
6I have a couple wii games too though
03but who would willingly pay money for it
03:|
03Such a waste of $50
03>_>
Airpuff: mmmmfmmfm
02^^^^
pikorar: I don't know. You've been fairly malleable so far... ;)
because they stopped taking in gamecubes and gamecube games since april
03That...was about when I stopped buying games.
03XD
hoofs ups behind Airpuff and knocks it out with a boot to the head.
02Same
Barbetos: dawwwww
6wait
03because hey, download game for free, don't like it? No harm done
02Well I started buying games more carefully XD
And frees CCCP agian
6 5 games is 20 bucks
/me is out cold.
Airpuff: Are you manhandling my CCCP... please, do go on... ;)
xD
03Other than maybe wasting some bandwidth
GilDash: Malleable? Please? I don't bend for anyone...
/me wakes up
oh GilDash
1,3lol, mods + otakon
/me glomps GilDash
/me not sure what to do
EY! ...
what are the movies set for tomorrow?
07games worth more than $3, which you can't check
we did watch morgan freeman yesterday, i hope its shawshank
1,3the one at 2, the one at 4, and the one at 6
kirzstryfe op otakon so we make mods vs viewers
When I see that red circle with the 4 on it, I can't help but think it's going to countdown to 3,2,1.
/me lifts Ponies47 with magic and leads him closer.... "so... you jelly?" *puts Ponies47 inside a tub if jelly.
1,3nope :p
6pretty sure mine are
xD
unless some kind of major game is announced at e3 this year, the only game that I plan on buying between now and decemeber would be Kingdom Hearts 3D
no, because then otakon will just kick all the shippers.
and I already got $25 down on that
oh, and Pokemong Black 2
Shizuka.
-g
02Sadly even if I tried downloading
Shizuka, DAT PING!
Breaks Airpuffs magic force with the awesome power of my wings and I fly away with CCCP
02My computer is such crap that it would lag like no tomorrow
if he was smart he would un op the mods and take control
I don't hear any ping
07though
03internet speed has nothing to do with computer speed
Ponies47: yay!
07if you find 7 games
and since skullgirls isnt playing nice tonight....
03do I need to get into this again? XD
otakon, I ship you with everypony.
07that's practically getting diablo 3 for nothing
pikorar: Oh please, a little bit of heat and I bend you right where I want you... ;)
It's ok CCCP . Airpuff can't hurt you but now I'm sticky. :(
Whos streaming?
/me sits back and watches both shows.
/me gags Ponies47.
Damn GilDash... You always know just what to say...
/me Aims in Pinkies Party canon and shoots, hitting Ponies47 's wing and makes him fall down into another tub of jelly while CCCP lands in one besides
02Err after I download the games have nothing to do with the internet
6when does gamestop close 8D
Ponies47: Stop manhandling my manhandlers.
9:30 I think
02Emulators man.

6i might head down there
What is all this talk of Manhandling?
otakon x zombies
02Oh wait
6it's on our corner
otakon: is kinda bad at this ^^
Is even more sticky and out cold
02Diablo 3 came out today
6yes
6yes it did
Hah glorious.
indeed.
03you just download the game and burn it, play it on whatever system
/me puts gag back in CCCP 's mouth.
There we go.
03or if it's DS, put it on the SD card of your flash cart
03w/e
inb4 diablo 3 on a virtual boy
02Ohh something like that? That's not what I'm talking about lol, yeah I just use emulators cause I'm not tech savvy
6which is why I'm selling back my pokemon games
6some of em
mfmfmfmmfmmfmfmf
02And before you say "It's easy" that's how not tech savvy I am
There is no escape!
03LOL trying to emulate Wii
mfmfmfmmfmmfmfmf
/me cleans Ponies47 up and wraps a blanket around him.
just curious is dinky related to Derpy?
02Oh no no
Ponies47: Wouldn't want you freezing to death. :)
02Just DS games
03so I got my PS3 to read copied games. Heck yeah
ME
Shane377: Fanonically, yes.
03granted LOL PS3 GAMING

/me mmmffmfmmmfm :(
GilDash: Thanks. But what do you plan on doing to me?
OMG OMG OKMG DEAD
03now I just have to set up some fancy magic so I can get on PSN with said copied games :P
and CCCP?
02Reminds me of what my dad did
GilDash: what about doctor hooves, is he related to derpy?
Kinda funny how you saved Ponies47 and not CCCP GilDash xDD
/me throws CCCP in a bag and runs off with him
02Rent games, burn them, send them back.

otakon x ded
03Yep
dinky is occasionally fanonized as being derpy' daughter
D:
03my dad does it with movies
Ey!!

03Finally, someone with common sense! :P
=I
I use my PS3 for copying SACDs. UMAD?
/me hides CCCP, ungags him "RUN!"
Ponies47: probably all of it.
03I asked my friend to find me SACDs
/me goes back to lurking
Bleh all these heroes T.T
GilDash We need to go and save CCCP
03but I prefer to unlock the full potential of whatever systems I have
/me noms LunaSlurry
03DSes without flash carts, are super limited
/me runs
did you install inux yet?
03nope
02Now my dad's kinda money savvy
03haven't tried
/me ish nommed
02And when a movie comes out he buys it on blue-ray
/me goes into sugarcube corner
dat Meanwhile
/me teleports CCCP to him.
/me gags CCCP before he racts.
02He wants that new Resident Evil game
It would appear that there are zombies everywhere.
/me * reacts
02And is actually willing to buy a PS3 just to play it
Allo everypony.

hi Meanwhile.
Elo Meanwhile

02Gimme those Monster Hunter games

07I'd trade in the 7 if you're able, then sell the DSi to amazon for credit there
lol
DUN DUN DUUUUUUM
6k
Hello! BOOM!
S BANANA
A*
DUN DUN DUUUUUUM
03Monster Hunter games for which system?
inb4 Monster Hunter 3G/4 being announced for NA at e3
02Wii
LunaSlurry: I went to play SupCom2. I literally spent the time up 'till now on one game because my ai team mates keep squandering their forces and the enemy ai does too. :I
07compare against amazon and come up with a total first
PS2, PSP, Wii
6koso, don't hold your breath
Drops non CCCP
@drf
03I was talking to Shiny :P
it's possible
03since she wanted games
03etc
03well
03Wii is easy to hack
at the very least
It's an endless stream of me sending my troops off to die.
Monster Hunter 4
6looks like there's going to be no MH3G announcement at E3
will have some kind of formal reveal
6no MH announcement at all
03I could easily download the games for you
I fly back to go save the real CCCP!
Ah....
Eventually though, EVENTUALLY, I'll break them.
/me teleports to CCP and Ponies47 then grabbing them with magic defenestrating them into another tub of jelly.
Shizuka is best zombie
02Unless they go SURPRISE on us.
what are you doing to me??
xD
02I actually need to look to see what Wii games there are, I believe there's only one or two
02And I have one
which, again, is possible :3
Flys out of jelly bucks Airpuff in the nose. Grabs CCCP and we fly away
/me retrieves CCCP and Ponies47. He cleans them up.
Dat hunter lag.
suprises happen.
Thanks GilDash :)
dat yelling
6hmm, gamestop is open til 9pm
Bah.
6I should walk over there after dinner
in that case I might as well wish for a legit real-time pokemon action RPG
D:
10Ciao everyone, heading off for the night :3
Night RainBroDash.

10see you all soon

Ponies47: I can think of something. ;)
/me coughs like crazy.
6other than target

Takes pikorar to the hosiptial
Anything going on in here?
02That's about the same for me :'D
/me continues coughing.
the artwork is lovely, and the idea of conquering kingdoms is cool
What you need to do is access the console
http://notalwaysright.com/a-moooo-sing-customers/11471
And spawn 4 tanks :3
GilDash: what?
6went from small country town to LA
/me stares at CCCP from the top of GilDash 's head.
Of course, that'd need the server password.
6what a culture shock
02Ouch
07hurr
I'd have to wait for the initial reviews before I make a decision about buying it though
Derpy_Hooves: so are you related to doctor hooves?
im back
6it was fun lol
/me coughs so much he bends light with the water vapor escaping his lungs and coughs out rainbows.
07I thought it /wasn't/ LA
/me runs
Who doesn't know how to crouch?
02I don't know if I'd get it lol I have no money
LunaSlurry? does that mean theres a SlurryLuna right now too?

03<Shiny-Slowpoke> No :c <- well, they're only like $12
pikorar: lol

Ponies47: You wanted to know. :D
as you progress
03and problem solved
03:P
otakon, wow, he is so RAAAAGE XD
07that's why I always lump the entire south bay together and call it San Jose
07:3c
02I don't even have that kind of money OTL
CCCP: What about you?
02And yes it does :O
because I only played for the first few hours and I didn't see much to it
GilDash: :D
6kyu exactly

/me still stands atop of Gildash 's head leaning towards the horn
GilDash: wuut?
02It's not a really deep story, but it does have one.
otakon should otakon otakon
6I only separate Los Gatos, Sacramento, and Fremont from San jose
off to youtube, then
"PEW PEW PEW"
.-.
6the rest of it is san jose
otakon does not adapt well to pc gaming.
But for reals, I'm coughing like crazies and it doesn't feel good... My chest is burning.
02Go to Wiki and find it
Grabs Airpuff and throws him into a tub of jelly. Who's jelly now?
pikorar, whats wrong?
13and comcast is back to failing hard again
07uh
13sorry, no stream
07Sacramento?
/me teleports out of the tub before i hit the jelly.
07that's
either my sense of humor is out of order atm, or asdf movie has run out of juice
07kinda far
07|D
Well you win some you lose a lot.
03it's all California to me, wtf are you guys on about
/me hides
/me is back at the top of GilDash 's head
CCCP: otakon, shmotakon... Come here...
twilight_sprinkler: a little bit of the second

/me 08,01steals Shizuka
02What drf said
I have some sort of cold, panda. It's really agressive and I'm getting terrible coughing fits. The problem is my temperature is normal, my oxygen levels are at 100% and the doctors insist that my lungs are clear... But I'm really sick.
08,01i can't be fucked with this computational complexity crap
6michigan is michigan to me too
6so
6yeh
08,01i like processors and operating systems
California is a magical place
Shane377: He threw me into jelly!
6california is one of the few states that actually can be divided
now son dont touch that nigel
6unlike you guys lol
/me 08,01explodes, then explodes agai
07michigan is just "lame half of the US" to me
inb4 montana
/me flees
hai
/me creates a protective barrier of magic which expands and pushes Ponies47 back and shattering the jelly cauldron.
6montana is montana
02Uh huh we're divided!
6no one lives there lol
Ponies47: that dats not a reason to act violently
well if you divided it in half
02"You guys in the north" and "You guys in the south"
you'd have two sizable cities
Alright everypony I'll be playing MineCraft! See y'all soon!
so yeah
03wait, what about Montana?
:D
pikorar, oh my friends father has the same thing. He coughs all the time but not sick. Bit he has a bit of a phlegm problem

/me teleports behind one of GilDashes legs and hugs it scared

COLORADO
IS SO PRETTY
<3
pikorar, honey and lemon. Why not just brew some hot tea with honey ^^
i hate when the doctor tells me to drink honey and lemon
6that
IT TASTES HORRIBLE!
6what drf posted
6as horrible as that is
Walks up to Airpuff looks at him with a I'm going to kill you face but then smiles. I'm sorry Airpuff :(
/me sneaks up behind CCCP and places hooves before eyes.
6I laughed really hard
6I feel awful
2^
02Realization face
:(
dont they usually give you jello at hospitals?
:)
03I know right
CCCP: Guess who?
GilDash: you?
panda... I've never liked tea to be honest... But what the doctor said is that I can't take any liquids with the honey or else it'll go down too quickly to actually cover up the nerve endings that are making me cough... That's how he said it.
/me noms on CCCP's ear.
02So Ran
02May I PM?
08,01anyone getting anything on stream?
CCCP: Mmm... how did you know?
Nah stream went down.
2Of course
pikorar, ah I see, you need it to coat your throat
07lol
03http://cheezfailbooking.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/funny-facebook-fails-too-many-fails-to-list.jpg
whats up?
pikorar: What he's pescribed you is for a freaking cough.
/me returns to normal size before poking Ponies47
GilDash: my pinkie sense tells me (or what ever its called)
Yeah, panda... I just don't see how it'll help...
/me kisses CCCP.
Shizu was streaming L4D2 but comcast took a nosedive and understandably it's staying that way.
CCCP: What does it tell you about that? ;)
pikorar: well, it will ease the coughing im sure
hiii
Dinky is cutest filly
There. Beat Portal 2 single. Lesse.... >_>
GilDash: :o
Pokes Airpuff back with tears in eyes. Hugs Airpuff
Ponies47: use /me
4-0 in sfxt, 0-3 in skullgirls. I guess I can take that as a win?
GilDash: ......well you suddenly got creepy
And the time is....6.1 hours. Not bad.
and it crashed
and GilDash is still being GilDash.
/me blushes before smiling forgiving back
Well GilDash, he said that the infection should go away on its own. I've been taking an antibiotic for the last 6 months and he said that it ironically kills the exact kind of virus that I'm infected with. He just said that it'll take some time...
Derpy x Carrot top?
so Kyubree
bbl
03http://cheezfailbooking.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/funny-facebook-fails-no-escape.jpg <- OK, that one is actually really clever
pikorar: ... Antibiotics have no effect on viruses. >_<
03as much as... how do you steal a copy of Office?
lol nvm
Hugs Airpuff and says sorry. :(
are you a new form of Kyurem where instead of fusing with Reshiram or Zekrom, you fuse with an Umbreon?
13comcasts constant screwups are making me cry... not even sure if i'll be able to encore rocky...
superretroworld: Suddenly? Lol, what? :D
yeah, my game crashed
GilDash: Sorry, I use the word virus for everything. He just said that it'll kill the infection.
Shizuka: sad face
Shizu: Don't cry. ;_;
pikorar .... antibiotics are just against bacteria... xD
ARGH!
GilDash: you said 'kisses cccr'
boxed copy?
STUPID UPDATE, WHY NOW!?
otakon x da freakin room.
dont cry shizu SMILE :D
pikorar: But it probably *is* that kind of virus. WHich means it'll have no effect. >_<
Seriously otakon you take to the pc like a fish takes to the desert.
otakon, you rage so much ^^
Ok Airpuff now what's going on with CCCP?
we need a pinkie smiling emoticon
/me laughs at Ponies47
Meanwhile: I'm the one trying to work the room up...
Is the stream even up?
pikorar, oh and you know that honey has meany positive medicial effects?
otakon: eenope.
oh just wondering
Airpuff: Like a evil laugh?
1,3nittany_discord, otakon, you coming back in?
Ponies47: idk
GilDash: What I"m saying is that he didn't actually use the word virus... He used the word infection. Actually he even told me that it won't kill viruses. I just wasn't paying close attention to what i was typing. -.-
kirzstryfe: I'll pass for now, I need to play it about 6 years to get to novice level
kirzstryfe: u not streaming lfd?
Ponies47: nope. Just a glad laugh.
/me teleports to CCCP and hugs
Airpuff: I begin to laugh to and we brohoof /)
/me introduces dinky to panda
03true
/me nuzzles Airpuff
1,3ok, need 2 more to fill empty spots then
03but still, why would you leave that lying around for someone to steal but not your computer XD

wtfberserk: we have an answer

I remember there was this huge torrent of all the brony music in one big list...
And I can't recall what it was called.
oh, I'm out on this one.
I'm wanting to get back into DJing.
And what better way to start than start with brony music.
wtfberserk: it's Samurai Champloo is streaming
Aye?
Huh?

08,01okay, what would you like next?

Ingwaz: otakon: oh
im guessing hes hacking
No one knows of the big list?

Reikim depends on your tactic
XD---- DeathStar
6we had familiy from indiana come out
Chrysalis: No.
6we actually had a fairly large earthquake one of the nights they were here
DeathStar: did u get it with a happy meal and did u get to choose between the toy or did u just get a a mlp toy and would it happen in asu too?
02then it would be scary, which I would like XD
Chrysalis: Moving the king first is bad. Always.
6me, my mom, and my grandma were like "yeah this is cool"
aus*
to protect the world from devesta- wait wrong anime.
For great justice
Reikim yes, iv won games through breakin strategy
Reikim: he didnt move the king first
6the rest of them were literally diving under the table
also, you can't move the king first
Reikim: the game was already in progress
Chrysalis: There are very, very few exceptions.
T S Parking?
Chrysalis: the game was already in progress
twilight_sprinkler: Good point, actually.
twilight_sprinkler: If he wasn't in check, though, he shouldn't have. More than enough pieces to move something else.
oh no mom's almost home :(
11,01S1 of Code Geass?

02thought so
11,01It's a service to help me find work.
i'll probably sneak out of bed when she falls asleep
Shane377: that seems like it would involve effort maybe you should check the mc donalds website
I wish I had some pony stuff. But I'm to much of a scootaloo for that. :(
i like how the people are portrayed
Nittany_Discord: Ah, okay then.
or maybe she'll go out and i can stay up late
DeathStar: plzzzz
twilight_sprinkler: They're like real people.

Shane337: This series excels at blurring the line.
mario_pony: the dentist is so good
Shane377: generally britannians are bad, but there are many exceptions
/me 11,01stays up.
denntists are evil
Shane377: japanese are mostly good, but again exceptions
pony_911: Death I mean cake!
11,01I can't afford to go to the dentist right now.
mario_pony: they stick a massive needle in mouth
11,01Or I would.
in ur*
Shane377: other countries arent really bad or good
11,01I'm overdue for a cleaning.
i remember watching The Dentist when i was 8
twilight_sprinkler: lol that helps
Shane377: ur gonna scare the boi
Shane377: well yeah its nt that simple
it was horrible
MahBoi777: lol thats the point
/me hugs everypony :3
lol at poison gas.
I was thinking a T-shirt to. But I would like to have a few of the toys to. But I'm to much of scootaloo to do that. Does anypony know If you can but Brony T-shirts @ stores? Or do you have to buy them off the internet?
The dentist sucks, unless its Colgate
11,01Was that about a dentist going nuts?
/me hugs Tarku back
actually .....i feel very comfortable and relax when i go to the dentist
mario_pony: the saw they use to cut ur teeth wen u get a filling
ponies47: You could always try a convention.
11,01I remember seeing a movie where a dentist goes nuts.
I'm years overdue for a dentist appointment
mario_pony: it sounds like a chainsaw on ur teeth
Shane377: o_o
/me gives Nittany_Discord nuts
ponies47: You have to go the first day, though, because pony merch at a con will almost always sell out in under 24 hours.
SPINZAKU
who is currently streaming atm?
11,01He pulls the teeth out of his girlfriend's mouth and cuts her tongue out.
Reikim: No brony-con in Wisconsin :(
Nittany_Discord: me too t was called The Dentist
11,01And then just starts killing people.
O_o
WHOS UP FOR A CUPCAKE EATING CONTEST
ponies47: Basically any con will do. We have a tendency to invade cons...:P
Nittany_Discord: they made a sequel
Nittany_Discord: O-o wats this movie

The Dentist
11,01I won't rant.
11,01I'm sorry for this morning.
Oh good, because I will
DUN DUN DUN
CriticKitten: I expected something like that to happen
GEE, SERVER TROUBLE, HOW AWFUL.
11,01Luna is a good person, and ruining her stream with my cynicism was bad.
0//0
Why if only the game had some sort of MODE that could allow its users to play the game OFFLINE....
BUT THAT'S JUST SILLY LOL.
:3
11,01CriticKitten: Welcome to modern gaming.
sex....
dat hot anime girl
Hand up, anypony who DIDN'T expect problems with Diablo IIII launch. I like to see the minority.
11,01That's why I'm not excited about new games anymore.
what, conversation is happening here
weird
Reikim: True. Well anthor problem is my patrents still don't know I'm a brony. :( To scared to tell them. Wow I'm really like Fluttershy.
11,01So much bullshit that shouldn't be there.
CupcakeWarrior: Hot anime girl with special powers. Seems pretty standard.
CriticKitten oh hello there DRM, arnt you supposed to stop pirates and give a better experience to paying customers, oh whats that you got your targets all mixed up?
*Parents
I'm only lookin forward to 1 game this year, it was previously 2 :/
Oh I knew it would happen. I'm glad it did really, helped prove the point that the game isn't the quality it should be.
ponies47: tell them right now
/me doesnt play popular games
ponies47: They'll find out eventually. Don't worry 'bout pushing it.
/me happens
Yuri Lowenthal playing a Yuri Lowenthal character.

LOOK AT HIM !!!!!!????? SO SKINNY !!!!
Storm: Yup

yippie-kayey
mario_pony: I CAN'T I'M TO SCARED!
lol
Nittany_Discord: What about console games?
skyrim
ponies47: they are your parents they it shouldn't matter to them
Reikim: True but for now it will remain my little secret :)
Nittany: We still love ya. <3
now dats fucked
So basically Clovis is a bit of an asshole.
ded
dammit
Reikim you mean the ones based on hugely outdated hardware that treat the players like idiots?
Chrysalis: Not all of them do.
most of them dude
show me one shooter without autoaim
or a shooter that doesnt tell you
Chrysalis: What's auto-aim?
wait what r we talking about .....
...
OH MY GOD U NEED TO PRESS X TO JUMP
hmm
mario_pony: Sorry I'm WAY to much of a Scootaloo for that! Ah I'll em one of these days, :\
dammit
Chrysalis: PC Shooters dont have auto aim...
I has hot chocolate :3
Chrysalis: I wouldn't know, I haven't played anything except TF2...which doesn't even have a manual.
I hate auto-aim
/me 11,01is a gamer, but a very cynical one that HATES the modern gaming industry, so he'll get in a rant about why the industry is bad in 10 seconds flat if he doesn't watch out. He just misses the days before games were ruined by publishers.
shooters on consoles pull your crosshairs TOWARDS your enemies when you shoot
lolz nice
gotta go !!!!!!!! piano practicing time !!!!
they actively help you shoot better
mario_pony: Or they'll just find out
/me 11,01hugs CriticKitten
Chrysalis: if not the enemies will get infront of you
Chrysalis: Metroid Prime 3. But that's not really a true shooter.
CriticKitten is best kitten
/me hugs Nittany_Discord

Oh god Kallen so cute.
Reikim: they do later
Reikim: in R2

in the end of R2
Command prompts scare me, theyre way too hard to use
twilight_sprinkler: No they don't, I've gotten there, but they haven't explained why she was so interested in him from the get-go.
ponies47: cause since my mom knows i can have my PS3 ponified and now i'm not scared that my mom will see it

twilight_sprinkler: Why she seemed to know him beforehand.
Reikim: i can tell you in om
03oh
so i don't have to hide it
oh you mean how she knew Reikim ?
twilight_sprinkler: Why she seemed to know him.
twilight_sprinkler: I already did the trippy episode about her backstory.
I tried using DOSbox once, but I couldnt figure out how to even start a game
Reikim: well, its part mystical but there is a connection
CupcakeWarrior: That's not that hard, actually.
twilight_sprinkler: What?
MahBoi777
twilight_sprinkler: Okay, I'll wait that out then.
08,01FUCK YES, I MEMORISED THE MASTER THEOREM
08,01finally!
mushroom: mmmmmmyeees?
yay!
CupcakeWarrior: I use DOSbox to play Princess Maker 2
HOORAY!
Om|reading: have you seen the series?
MahBoi777
I have dealt with the pronlem of pony opinions by the simple and elegant usage of the fact that I'm 54 years old, known to be slightly crazy, and not giving a buck what anyone else thinks. It' surprisingly effective.
mario_pony
twilight_sprinkler: Yes I have.
MahBoi777:
08,01oh yeah, shit, i forgot i still had the stream running
Om|reading: ok ill tell you in pm
Petrified_Discord
Reikim: You have to type in a bunch of commands to start the game, how are you supposed to figure them out?
lol
Petrified_Discord: ...Wait...:|
CupcakeWarrior: Logic
:|
lol
03very slow download
great just great
?
08,01Reikim: the master theorem in computational complexity is a way of doing complexity analysis on recursive divide and conquer algorithms
CupcakeWarrior: You load the drive into the program as a virtual drive, then you browse through to find your game.
Virtual drive?
mushroom: I ponified my computer once. I had desktopPonies and a pony desktop picture. But then got worried and took the DesktopPonies off and put the picture I had before back. I still have DesktopPonies in my files but I'm to scared to tell my parents.
i was gonna showe but i ran out of shampoo :(

BlueFlare, you are a 5Scyther.

CupcakeWarrior: It's not actually there, but it's there for the emulator's purposes.
but it sure felt cold
mario_pony: no shampoo?! what sorcery is this??
CupcakeWarrior: It's like...the emulator treats it like a drive, if you were running MS-DOS
ponies47: well if i was you i would straight up tell them
Not Saeson 2?
Kencolt: Not offically last time I checked
/me should be sleeping...but isn't.

Petrified_Discord: LOL, are you lost sir?

Nittany_Discord: dress up like soarin in very tight spandex
SuperDismo64: That's what I want to know!
So if someone just came to one of theese not knowing what te fuck it was, and everyone around them was like
Petrified_Discord: Here's the script http://www.badmovies.org/movies/rockyhorror/audience/
11,01I'm only doing maid outfits.
ASSSHOLE!
SLLLLLLUT!
SuperBrony64: i found a video that shows DeathStar when she was at McDonalds and when she go the plush toy
13IT WAS A NIGHT IN
There's a fucking SCRIPT?! :D
11,01Unless you have a real good non-maid suggestion.
13and yes follow CupcakeWarrior's script, there's a bunch in this track that aren't on it and vice versa
Nittany_Discord: dress like SuperBrony64?
13but the most well known lines are there
lol a script
11,01Normal, or r63?
r63 ofc <3
Nittany_Discord: Wear a French Maid outfit.
6I know
Just getting in the spirit of things ;)
6i have met a couple people who get headaches off advil
11,01SuperDismo64: K. Go find one.
03so what are you saying o.o
6no idea why
03oh
11,01PM it to me.
03well
03Tylenol is the only other thing I have
03and it doesn't work as well
Petrified_ASSHOLE: lmao
03since I can't take pills, Alleve or whatever it is is out of the question
inb4 Time Warp
6wait
6what
11,01XD
6there's liquid advil?
13X3
03yes
03XD
6liquid meds seem to cause more headaches than pills lol
6just saying
hahaha
13see most of it is them all yelling random things
03it's called children's Advil but it's just as strong as the regular kind
03well
03I have no other option
13it's when they all get together for one line that it jumps a level of funny <3
huzzah for random shouting!
It's actually funny when I can understand it :D
+
/me 11,01pets Petrified_SLUT
13YAY RANDOM SHOUTING
xD
Petrified_SLUT: <-- lol
/me is petted :O
07learn to ingest pills? o.o
XCD------
She's not going to....
I dont know about you guys, but this yelling is kind of ruining it for me :S
again, dat mute.
03ingest?
03you mean swallow?
6take >.>
03and I Tried... almost choked on it
dammit janet
6grind it up, put it on toast
03hmm
6which is actually me being serious
03does that work though? I know some meds lose most of the effect if you chop them up
Dat motorcycle gang
6thats how my parents got me to take sudafed when I was younger
03I mean, I have my anti-depressants that I'm taking now, I just chew the pills
03even though they taste gross
6I refused to take pills up until I was like 14
/me goes off to acquire cake
6quickly learned to take them without complaint when I had my wisdom teeth surgery
03it's not that I refuse to, I just can't... every time I try I end up spitting the thing out instinctually and gagging
mmmmmmm cake
6no I know
03because I have a really strong gag reflex
6I was the same way
03my orthodontist hated it
6....well, I lack a gag reflex now
03he could hardly even put my braces in
6but eh
03I almost puked all over the guy
03LOL
If there were less people yelling, I could actually hear the words being yelled
03well I probably shouldn't find that funny, but it's the only way I keep from hating myself is to laugh at myself :|
03anyway
13that is true
Shizuka, when does the song about a transvestite from transylvania come up?
6I rarely ever believe childrens meds are "just as powerful"
03point being I can't take pills. And liquid Advil has the same amount of ibuprofin as the pill form
03well
13seeing it with a couple people that know it is good for your first time
03I also take like
6because they're generally given much lower doses
034 doses of it
03:P
6so unless you take more pills
6yeh
03that's what I'm saying
03but one dose has half a pill worth
6which just flat out isn't healthy
panda - soon
03and you usually take what, 2 Advil pills?
AWWW :3 Dat shy Shizuka
03so I take like 4 doses
03LOL
6..
03It does work, just takes a while
6 8 pills
03wait
03seriously?
13panda: soon
6wait what
03as in
03my headache is slowly going away now
6one does is only half a pill?
So Im supposed to call Janet a slut?
03it just seems to make it worse off the bat
03uh
03OK
guy=asshole girl=slut plot=random yelling ^^
03how much ibuprofin is in one advil
6*dse
yes
6I don't know
CupcakeWarrior: No, I'm the slut.
13brad is ASSHOLE, janet is SLUT
6I just grab ibuprofin and take the dose.

6but then again
03I think one dose of the children's one is 100mgh
13YAY RICH WIERDOS
03*mg
6I don't take ibuprofin
Shizuka: what does that make me?
03hold on I'll look

i never had this thing overheat from firefox as far as i can tell
but then again, i never had it overheat from youtube either
i've had it overheat from terraria and minecraft before though
Ah, Rocky Horror
i'm just going to assume like drf once said
that the video card is crappy
my god.
i could see graphics glitches such as green lines on the plage load throbber if i use firefox for hours.
Dat kick
I already said that.
THAT was a cool effect :p

o `hai Nittany_Discord
these days its almost like a "required accesory" to have a cooling pad for your lap
not really sure what to say because i've ran virtual machines on this laptop without ever overheating
Trust me, this is so much fun at a midnight screening
or a case for your ipod/itouch
ae?
i strongly think it's the graphics card
03oh nice
03I just got Katamari Forever installed as a XMB title-screen game
03on the PS3
http://cfile7.uf.tistory.com/image/124CC8464FB2F7DE0732A0
was that sarcasm?
how many GB?

perhaps
11,01Shizuka: You should do this for other movies another night.

how do i look at her? Shane377
11,02^-^
omg how are you getting the callback lines in here?
hiya DeathStar ^^
/me 11,01hugs SuperBrony64
ive stolen VioletGreySha from u SuperBrony64
Why am I lagging so badly?
cause ur Evil_Spike ?
03basically, you have to install it to MultiMAN, copy the files to a flash drive. Then use eBootFix to patch some stuff allowing you to launch it from the PS3 title screen instaed of needing the loader itself
Of course
its an effect of the earlier time warp
hen3ry: xD
Throws deck of cards
11,02O.O
Who does things like this but his name starts with an 'R'?
panda: u kno how u look at her
Riffle?
13rifftrax
11,01Lol.
11,02y u steal him? ;~;
Shane377, I do?
/me dances on SuperBrony64 s head
SuperBrony64: VioletGreySha is a girl
13which by the way this is all i have http://pastebin.com/kxnzu6v0
Doesn't rifftrax also do yelling versions of the MLP songs?
11,01No.
/me pokes DeathStar, "do I look at you wierd or something?"
right so
13that's yaplap or something
No, that's Yaplap
11,01That's Yaplap.
Oh
/me gives SuperBrony64 an Allie Way
panda: i dunno
11,01And Sorlac does most of those.
how do you install games from pirated ISOs from the web?
03copy them to a flash drive or hard drive
13hehehe they're singing the imperial march
11,01Or Solrac.
03open MultiMAN
wonka with rifftrax?
03and copy to HDD
dat trident
03(PS3 HDD)
Its Val
13WallDives: the gene wilder one yes
11,02y u steal her? ;~;
you know, Yaplap should dub this whole movie ^^
03but you can also play them off flash/hard drive... however, less games work
03and slower speed
I need to see that.
/me hugs the Allie Way
/me sneaks up behind DeathStar and glomps her.
03but you can run them through eBootFix before you copy them to MultiMAN to see if it makes a .pkg
13GOODBYE ALL OF THIS
Midnight_Tempest: you so sneeky :)
13HELLOOOOOOO
03and if it does, that means you can launch it without needing the loader (once it's initially copied)
03confused yet?
/me runs
13HI OBLIVION! HOW'S THE WIFE AND KIDS
11,02HAI SHIZUKA :D/
SuperBrony64: cause she want me to lol

13magic
13snort snort
I take it this is the original? Also, new steam system?
the raptors licked the blood off ofc
leave no evidence
Midnight_Tempest: they cleaned the blood off they're very intelegent
That guy with the white beard reminds me of Sean Connery in Last Crusade AND makes me hungry for fried chicken.
DeathStar: indeed
Eddmario: have you not seen this?
Eddmario: but wouldn't that be colonel sanders?
I like Jeff's character and his view.
its a room full of killjoys
You know... they probably Raptor Jesus
It's been years since I've seen the original, and I've never seen the other ones, so my memories a little fuzzy on scenes from the original.
Eddmario: ah I see
KKKKKKKKKKK
wonder how much of a shitstorm there would be if someone created a RL Jurassic Park
The Rapture is at hand, Raptor Jesus has returned
raided mcdonalds
got 10 ponies
EonMastor: a large one i bet
PREPARE FOR THE VELOCIRAPTURE!
WTF is with the random talking?
Trixie!
suddenly annoying children
Torchhoof > Equestrian Innovations
I have to ebay McD ponies since they went away fast here
Is this a comedy version?
Riff
here come the shitty Exploders
/me sighs "those kids really annoy me"
Seriously, what's with the random voice overs?
13INTERACTIVE CD ROM
No lag?
The 20s econd rule

That doesn't answer my question Shizuka
Iforgot that kid XD
Eddmario, this is a rifftrax... people mocking the movie for the entertainment of us
Anyoen else lagging?

Nope.
F*ck
COSE!
Never heard of it. Is there a version for the G1 MLP "movie"?

Random fact: In the Jack Black version of King Kong, the movie he's showing the producers at the beginning is the original King Kong
/me pounces on DeathStar 'Surprise!'
Midnight_Tempest: AHHH!

/me summons the lovesaurus
13hey now
151? ENTER THE POKEMON G1 JOKES!
Eddmario Weird Al sang one of the pokeraps
no sorrry he did Polkamon
ANOTHER RANDOM FACT: The creators of King Kong sued Donkey Kong for the name being familiar. Coincidentally, the one who saved Nintendo was where the creators of Kirby came up for his name.
time for goatse
Spell-of-Gaming: your not silverscreen!
:I
my mum was probably one of them
-those cheering that is
stupid girl... hate that kid...
Midnight_Tempest: I hate boath kids in this movie
DeathStar: as do i... they were both annoying
even when I was little watching this
LOL JEFF
Hahaha
/me wonders if vegatarians ever make exceptions on eating certain types of meat?
DeadpoolDash: Some veggies eat Fish
^
Since it's not "Meat"
fish is meat...
^
anything from an animal is meat
Vordox: Those are called vegans, I think. :I
fish taco?
Vegans are retarded in that respect
Some vegans/Veggies also eat egg.
Spell-of-Gaming: nnope vegans don't eat fish or yogert or eggs ect
no, Vegans won't any animal by product
*eat
Oh, sorry. :I
Malcom.. XD
From what I know of afriend who does it for the healthy diet aspect, he'll eat meat only occassionally
my common sense is tingling...
indeed
^
Mutterguy_: Meat isn't the reason you get fat
It's Coalhydrates
That's the "Fattening" molecules
Meat has almost NOTHING of it.
I didn't say anything about getting fat
it would be supper unheathy for me if I became a vegetarian
It's Coalhydrates that causes Heart stop...
For some reason, I think this dinosaur is cuter than the others :I
almost time for dino scat pron
I'm pretty CERTAIN that's a diet thing
Maybe I saw some anime about dinosaurs
DeathStar, Cystic Fibrosis?
Mutterguy_: nope
i refuse to be a vegetarian... meat is needed in my diet
Mutterguy_: I have mild lupis and it noms my iron levels
nobody is telling you to be a vegetarian, Midnight_Tempest
boom boom
11,02I'm tired -.-
Rain: i know, just saying i would never be one...
13me too
SuperBrony64: Know the feeling
11,02We should all just
Well I go to a vegetarian potluck and the thing is theres a hell of a lot you can make with out needing any meat
11,02liek fall asleep

SuperBrony64: Can't College stuff

Samuel L. Jackson's primary role in this movie is the mandatory black guy that dies.

DeathStar: Well, he IS the Lord of Chaos.
