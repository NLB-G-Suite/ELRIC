Luna.
Bungie kinda hurt me a little
Those things combined, perhaps it is enough.
They have singlehandedly obliterated multiple franchises with executive meddling.
And killed good studios. >_>
I guess I should say state that "technically" borders it. not that its at all relevant to DerpStar's situation.

11,01EA is losing money.
I cried my eyes out I haven't cried since Afghanistan
But as long as customers keep putting up with this nonsense, it becomes a winning business model.
Lol

Oo, and since school just got out i plan on working out :3

If companies that screw over their customers lose money, it serves them right.

Refresh the stream. Just don't cross them.
More maids? You have tons already xD

I have a fever! And the only prescription is more maids!
11,01Lol.
....
oi, bugger off.
note to self: Do not taunt the maids

I asked earlier. Is the encore over or still in the future?
That's because the stream is OFF.

silly maids.
Then throw up...
08,01i also feel... not too great
08,01i'm stressing about the exam tomorrow
I don't know if anyone WANTS to throw up.
08,01i don't feel prepared
But it would be the good terminator, the one that protects the people rather than kill them off...
08,01but if i do last minute cramming now, i won't sleep
Saturn: take a stress pill
Saturn: well go do some study then
Saturn: You've made it this far, I'm sure you'll do fine
08,01PrincessLuna: but i won't
Saturn: I thought you said creaming instead of cramming :D
Saturn: stop doubting ur self
Saturn: Have you studied before today?
08,01i can't revise everything i want to revise in an our
Saturn: yep same here. my math lecturer is horrible and i dont feel prepared either
08,01PrincessLuna: oh aye, yes
iihuioghuif
Saturn: Maybe just cover the main points in the hour?
i AM best pony
/me thinks, then scratches out "Best" and replaces it with "Most Generous"
Maid O'clock already?
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4710/ when yousee it youll shit bricks
08,01PrincessLuna: well, the thing i need to revise most is a theorem that i need to memorise, and it just isn't sticking in my head
/me is only up at this time of day *for* maid hour.
08,01and to be honest, i would rather take an overdose right now than revise. that's how i feel.
Saturn: try to find some crazy logic to memorizing it
08,01not to be melodramatic or anything
/me is cleaned
Oh boy, math homework:|
/me slaps Saturn.
Saturn: as arnold schwarzenegger would say ; if its hard to remember, itll soon be difficult to forget
Saturn: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThkHUxtZNjY&feature=player_embedded
Hmm
Saturn: i memorized integration by parts this way: udv(udav-snake in my language)=uv(ultra-violet)-intvdu(voodoo). its stupid and crazy but it worked, my memory sucks :P

heh
03(that was supposed to be the name for Pok√©mon in the beginning)_
then they'd name it CapMon in the US
and people would think Capcom
and they don't want that

I'd be a sea serpent.
6no
hance
03that anime promo looks like a completely different series altogether
6it would have to be incorporated into the series, you'd be able to catch it in a pokeball, train it, battle others with it, earn badges
I have a special mop. Its also a sword!
TOAST HERE
00,03Yes I have! :O
Its really sweeping the nation

6they're animals right?
6lets go to america
BALD! BALD!
6those aren't animals?
What's taking place here now?
bai everybody!
BAAAAAALD

Next time, we eat........uuuum.............nothing?
Yes
03OK
6pokemon is the collective term for the creatures in the show, monsters that can be captured and trained, there was never a given rule that there's couldn't be more
I took care of it drf

6in fact it's always been said that there's more than people know of
6Or I can repost.
03LOL
i beg yer pardon?
Next time, we eat Old Spice Shampoo.
I still think after a year's time that 5th gen is an improvement over the previous games in many aspects
OH! Ive got it!
its okay :)
03OK
came back later though
anyway...who's seen the avengers?

He probably doesn't
03it's still not OK to harass someone like that though.
bah, bad luck.
03which is why I showed YOU instead of just banning him
6the fact he has someone on ignore and still talks about the person is a violation of respect for any individual
/me laughs because he is all that is evil in the world
I know
03exactly
I'm back
6I would too
6and eXAKR's my friend

I suppose I'll have to deal with this the unsavoury way again
03he's basically turning me into a mortal enemy because I don't like things he likes.
03which is the most retarded reasoning I've ever heard, tbh
03yes
Yes

http://ponykillerx.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d4zgb4t
/me Yawns
13but i would not want it to go catastrophically wrong
6Sometimes I enjoy a good argument, if both sides are substantiated.
isn't going to solve problems
Is it a bad idea to call impromtu a friend for no reason other than to talk to them?
is nothign palying or is it jsut me?
00,03That would be the WORST POSSIBLE THING
hey no shaving
or you mean the streaming?
http://objection.mrdictionary.net/go.php?n=5763665
*mane

13i mean i determined last night that it's apparently fine with streaming l4d alone
no
13i'm not sure if l4d2 is too much more taxing on hardware
/me makes a mess
6I'm going to make an assumption

It can go either way really

6That would be nice, NS. :P
07lol
:D
00,03Why can't I hold all these links?
07well it's usually either tech talk or an argument
O_O
SL
OMG
I just realized
03ebay
the music playing when he's vsing the ninjas
03where else
6Yep.
is a metal remix
Very
07and seeing the conversation
nice.
I'm GRINNING
<3
07we could do without the argument half
And seeing the conversation puts people off?
*Hugs Shane377* I'm sorry I chucked you into the trash :(
6I was interested in that.
but
6The rest of the music was kinda blah.
6ok well
03when I'm NOT here, it's usually either gen 5 talk or silence
03:P
6Because guitars, guitars, everywhere.
03art too
half the time no one would talk anyway
well drf, that's not a bad thing
but
the fact remains that drf is a part of the community and has all rights to talk
6probably because when you're gone we actually CAN talk about 5th gen
As does everyone else
6but that aside
word of the day: BENSON
SL
6no, no wells, because most of the time you DO comment into a 5th gen conversation
03Yeah, same idea there.
Guitars aren't bad
6when you very well don't have to
too much feels like clutter
especially when out of place
anyway
Sigh, Maid hour is over
...
6No one else was interrupting that conversation you had, DRF?
I was clicknig through tumblr when..... PING!
imagine if Pok√©mon was actually live action like that
6I don't do that ona regular basis unless you do something like "be a pro and don't use 5th gen" etc
well I mean
6Live-action?
:D
Derp! I'm not a maid
the fights
:p
03I know, but you did in that case and we weren't even talking to you
6Ah, real-time?
yeah
real time I mean
but they dont tell me
6*now
03that's something we agree on
6Hmm, well, I'm divided on that idea.
although, PokePark is the closest to that right now lol
Hello?
07funny that you remember that one time, but can you count all the other times you throw insults into other conve...
07late
03insults and saying I don't like something are two different things o_O
SL
didn't stop them from making pinbll
pinball
hello eeeeee3432
6True.
yes it was a spinoff
6why should a channel

6be split
6into separate channels
6for that
03I think she was kidding
03^
6Ascendant you're timing plus personality makes it hard

Do you know JUST how main offenses he's had?
6kyu actually I'm on drf and Ascendant's side here
07and DRF, just don't give him the reaction
6eXAKR's been doing this for literally a year..
^
03because he won't see my reply
6and he makes a point of doing this to drf
As in, PM warning
All I saw was the title. All I needed to see was the title.
07yes
But nevertheless, drf, you shouldn't react anyway
here, have some surprais buttsecks http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcS_zRr14ic
but I digress
03well OK
07but at the very least, I know he's just not going to listen to either of you specifically
He listens to me most of the time
6i warned him plenty of times too
/me engages lurk mode
6and I'm actually friends with him
03as honestly, I can take just about anything, I just shouldn't *have* to.

1,3L4D2
..oh...don't own that.
...traded my hat for Garry's mod instead..... =[
...are the stories listed on the site yet?
does gamestop take preowned collector's editions?
because
I recently traded a bunch of crap in including the blazblue special edition
and they didn't take it
03they actually give you *sensible* amounts for trade-ins
03like 2x or more of GameStop
mmmfmfmfmfmfmfm
03no
03they have a trade-in system
03</random>
6uh

/me leaves
6http://www.gamestop.com/collection/trade-in
goddamnit Olly
You can't kick me for no reason
07they boost the value of trade ins by 30%
07not lower the price of the games
http://9gag.com/gag/4187009
6I'd be trading in like 5 games
6so i'd get the 10 dollar boost
which games would you be trading in, rawra?
02Pokemon Battle Revolution
/me loves having unprovoked anxiety attacks.
07also, I've done a 25% trade in plus my 10% gamestop card and a $10 boost once
6and i might be trading in some gamecube games
6maybe
07was still less than toys r us
07|D
/me proceeds to work on his homework once more.
they don't take gamecube games anymore
07they don't take GC

03That...was about when I stopped buying games.
03XD

-g
02Sadly even if I tried downloading
I don't hear any ping
07though
03internet speed has nothing to do with computer speed
07if you find 7 games

It's an endless stream of me sending my troops off to die.
6looks like there's going to be no MH3G announcement at E3
6no MH announcement at all
03I could easily download the games for you
Eventually though, EVENTUALLY, I'll break them.

07:3c
02I don't even have that kind of money OTL
02And yes it does :O
because I only played for the first few hours and I didn't see much to it

"PEW PEW PEW"
.-.
6the rest of it is san jose
But for reals, I'm coughing like crazies and it doesn't feel good... My chest is burning.

dammit janet
6grind it up, put it on toast
03hmm
03does that work though? I know some meds lose most of the effect if you chop them up
Dat motorcycle gang
6thats how my parents got me to take sudafed when I was younger
03I mean, I have my anti-depressants that I'm taking now, I just chew the pills
03even though they taste gross
6I refused to take pills up until I was like 14
03it's not that I refuse to, I just can't... every time I try I end up spitting the thing out instinctually and gagging
6no I know
6I was the same way
03my orthodontist hated it
03he could hardly even put my braces in
6but eh
03LOL
If there were less people yelling, I could actually hear the words being yelled
03anyway
6I rarely ever believe childrens meds are "just as powerful"
03well
03I also take like
6because they're generally given much lower doses
034 doses of it
03:P
6so unless you take more pills
6yeh
03but one dose has half a pill worth
6which just flat out isn't healthy
03so I take like 4 doses
03LOL
6..
03It does work, just takes a while
6 8 pills
03wait
03seriously?
13panda: soon
03as in
03my headache is slowly going away now
6one does is only half a pill?
03it just seems to make it worse off the bat
03uh
03OK
03how much ibuprofin is in one advil
6*dse
yes
6I don't know
13brad is ASSHOLE, janet is SLUT
6I just grab ibuprofin and take the dose.

03I think one dose of the children's one is 100mgh
13YAY RICH WIERDOS
03*mg
6I don't take ibuprofin
03hold on I'll look

dat trident
03(PS3 HDD)
Its Val
13WallDives: the gene wilder one yes
11,02y u steal her? ;~;
03but you can also play them off flash/hard drive... however, less games work
03and slower speed
I need to see that.
03but you can run them through eBootFix before you copy them to MultiMAN to see if it makes a .pkg
13GOODBYE ALL OF THIS
13HELLOOOOOOO
03and if it does, that means you can launch it without needing the loader (once it's initially copied)
03confused yet?
