/me Febuary 15th
February*
mines on the 13th
That was one of the reasons why I got it, but also because most of the cassette player was made out of metal
not many things nowadays are made with metal, its all plastic
00,10his right to like or not like some one.
But based on skin colour?
checked it online and it was worth a bunch of money, I ended up keeping the headphones from it because the sound is real good
I don't have a way to compare it to some expensive modern headphones now, but the sound is awesome on it.
compared to 10-20 dollar headphones from the store
oh that's cool, I never knew that
isnt tonight movie night?
It was.
lol
But you can still make it to the Euro movie night ^__^

Oh, I see
Wait, did we switch embeds while I wasn't looking?
0,2Hey! are you getting stream
ARGH. COLORS.
k
Right, I refreshed right before you made that coloured remark :P
hey everypony are yall gona celerbate night meer night
No idea. Any suggestions?
Yeah, I was watching a crazy show.
But note that not everybody talks like that.
ahh ok and someone stays the same?
Basically, not everyone on the show is a pony.
oh
yeah, he seemed like a doormat or something
Heh, yeah, especially when concerned with certain ponies ;)
Spike knows who's the best. He's alright.
Best pony
Vamps?...
vampires
But it's completely unrelated.
^
"Why do the vampires in twilight sparkle?" "Why do the vampires in me what?"
Oooooh. That mess.
suddenly boom
Yeah, I don't associate the name with the Twilight Saga either :3
Learn this name.
Rarity.
I say it alot.
11,02Night all :)
With the maginificent squiggles.
She's great.
Oh yeah her she's in the show too.
And she's cute.
I guess. >_>
Not me, of course, but still :P
fluttershy? seems legit
Well, she did get overly mad in the one episode you saw, but she's not usually like that.
I'd say she got mad for a good reason for a lost cause though.
Not usually
Ello there.
And the drink.
hold on someone is spamming me on skype hold on...
he keeps spammong me and telling me to watch it..it must be good
First warning.
Don't.
Torture porn.
Pretty much.
Come on guys, spoilers.
OMG WTF!!!!! NOOOOOOOO!!! WHYYYY??!!! DAMMIT!!!! NOOOOOOOOOOO
you should have warned me earlier :'(

11,02Lunacorn: My reaction to Rayman Legends being delayed.
Oh, the other famous one.
The other fic, yeah. It's alright.
thank you ;:u:; i needed the huggles
Yeesh, I nearly cried at that one LOST episode
Check out Rainbow Factory, it's much more happier.
Lol.
Oh yeah, I've seen him around
I don't recall
Not too gory, it's more sad imo.
It's not as detailed.
>_>
<_<
damn trolls!
On Skype?
Oh well, c'est la vie :)
Yeah, comes with the territory
umm?
Or ignore them, that works too.
That too
Uhh, that's kind of a cliched statement, "Love and tolerate"
Misused as well
Sometimes
ok..
Taken to the extreme.
It's an overused statement but still
This one: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/887/
That's probably the correct usage. An anti-troll weapon.
But now it's in a different context. >_>
ok...
Yeah, I'd find that horribly obnoxious.

There's one more good one. Gotta find it...

That was the season 1 finale, though.
?

Best Night Ever.
he was like, umm..no
That's my sister's take on the craze
but then i made him watch it and he was like "omg this is amazing"
and i showed him this site and alas! he was on!
Yeah, my family knows that I've watched and enjoyed the show. They don't really care.
My familiy don't care. Too much.
At least this way he didn't have to wait 7 months for season 3
A smark remark here and there.
Wait, that's more like six months. Six and a half?
I lost count.
Six and two thirds?
XD
he says hi
lol should i let him on?
I feel like I'm on TV :D
Lol.
<_<
Righto
Wait, I meant to say "Tag team"
:D
lol jk he is just nice

You can just /nick to switch, you know.

lawl
Yes, the drama and stupidity that revolved around that.
On both sides. >_>
and now i am meddling around on brony2447's deviantart.. MUHAHAHAHA!
I don't think so...what makes you say that?
Which apparently means Derpy is a retard
Yeah. Tabitha voiced her.
Is that really why she did the voice that way?
Apparently.
Huh.
Whelp. Still don't care :D
My computer was hardly slow
She took her out of her credits when the crap hit.
retards dont act like that.. ive had PLENTY of experience with REAL retards
MOVING ON!
i mean actually mentally
Please do.
I am fine with both voices though :D
Same.
Speaking of Islands...
But I still have to say, the boyish version of Derpy saying "Yeeeaaaaah, Applejack! Whooooo!" is a bit cuter, imo.
Where was this?
Right
(Me scaring the newbie)
Yes rly.
inb4 the... Plushie... :$
NO

Or perhaps they use the same VA's because it's easier that way.
00,10not banned persay but tends to encite alot of spam
Probably doesn't taste the same as the real thing
2,14 >implying everything else on the hub is automatically bad
>Implying that Implying is not Implying
dat implying
implying got rome destroyed in a year
Imply-ception
certainly a long way from 2 years ago
Thing is, it /could/ be good.
2,14 a long way down, yes
But it feels like we're being exploited, and I don't like that feeling.
yes. I remember when episode 3 came out
lets hope thats a clue :)
Not the lecture! D:
