Bumfuck early. Gotta remember that one.
Awright!
it flys
(Well technically minwage doesn't even exist over here, and compaired to the US, this would be sub-minwage)
13yay artificially raising the price of labor!
can't you try to simulate the Nasa spaceship?
lol
Artificially raising price of labor has some detrimental effects, it creates a lack of labor and a lack of money flow. :>
which is weird, considering that you'd think minimum wage was made to make things more fair for people. Economics can be fascinating.
/me sighs
CLEARLY.
got some conservatives up in here
well it's okay--
even worse than the liberals and that's saying something
:D
the most destructive effect of a high minimum wage is an extreme youth unemployment

remove mustaches from front
00,02maybe the tailplane is blocking the exaust? it does simulate that
i'd bet it's those front wings are blocking airflow
move the tail plane up
or those turbines you have on the front
dive dive dive!

Saturn, go study and stop getting distracted! :P
poor Saturn, reading day is today for me~
08,01so i have to be able to convert java to jvm bytecode in my head
08,01it's okay, though; i'm well prepared
java... would drinking coffee help?
08,01and i'm quite good at the bytecode thing
08,01RoboGerbil: java is widely used pretty much everywhere

But I like cod. It's a pretty good-tasting fish. :<

There was an online gaming service in the 1990s that had a tagline "Taking violence on the streets and putting it on the internet." I loved that slogan.
I shouldn't be proud of this, but I was kick #2000 and #2222... ensuring that happened was a waste of my time, really.

I am starting to think that some people that specialize in "FengShui" are using "the science" and "the energy" to sell their products, such as Fountains
Do you need a license to do Feng Shui?
Don't link unaired episodes
