United State of England has some weird ass old Cartoon shows for kids
The other two books came in today :3

08,01and Simon and the Witch
Wa-psh

Why has no one streamed Inspector Gadget yet?
Haku1013, all I ever heard about the reboot is that it lives up to the original's standard.
<--- REMAKE THIS TODAY
08,01i may even stream a few episodes of Chucklevision
PLEASE
kidzrul732: Is that a mash up of the movie?
Did it just say planet texas?
Adventures of the Galaxy Rangers is better. :P
There's actually a Bravestarr/ MLP crossover on FFnet.
SPACE BRAEBURN!
Oh god Inspector Gadget I just remembered
Chucklevision? Never heard of it
08,01what the heck is this?
J_E_Smith71 I guess you could say that
MARSHAL BRAVESTARR!

Space Cowboy?
30-30 is a good pony

I would love to someday see a reboot of Sonic SATam - Still bitter it was canceled leaving the Doomsday Project as a cliffhanger
Lol. And his furry horse
DAT HOARSE!
THIRTY THIRTY!
He also had a horse can't forget the horse
I totally didn't see this. I'd probably remember if I did.
<3
Dat furry.
His horse companion, Thirty-Thirty
So retarded...
trivia : the horses gun is called Sarah Jane
COWBOY NINJA PIRATE SPACE STATION BATALION
Kandarihu It surpasses it, by far in my opinion. Granted, we could use a bit more character development and have the show speed up a little, but it's overall an amazing show
08,01hye man, don't knock anthro horses
ooooh, i remmeber that
08,01they're sexy.
bionic six?
I wasn't made yet while all this brick shitting happened soooooo yeah

MOM! MAKE ME A BIONIC SAMMICH!
08,01Barbetos: sexy sexy sexy sexy sexy. sexy.
This was a fantastic show.
WOO!! GALAXY RANGERS!!!
When I meet one, maybe I can give a commentary on the sexyness of an anthrohorse. As is, afraid the closest I've seen is catgirls, and they are definitely sexy. :p
moobull69: twilight is trying to kill me
This show is awesome. Even today, it's amazing.
moobull69: Um... brush your teeth?

Wow, all at once

This song makes my dick ROK HARD

Hi BroPony|MEDIC :)
When I watched this, I think it must've been shortly after I found out how badly Sailor Moon got edited. One of the first anime I watched dub in my miserable phase of my anime purist hipster life.
but seriously what am i looking at
Could we get the PMMM theme?
Did we show the TMNT theme?
After this one of course.
Dragonball intro I meant
WAIT
WAAAAIT
Sumica: THIS REMINDS ME OF SOMETHING
Sumica: The intro of the DK game on 64!
Vordox, the DK rap?

Sailor Moon theme. Either the english or japanese song will do ^_^
SPEAKING OF WHICH

Was that the mad hatter?
Pinky and the Brain?
marsupilami

Best part of Raw Toonage was a one-shot called Badly Animated Man
I remember this intro

I don't know how it raw it can be. It doesn't *look* like stoyboarding.
>Badly Animated Man

*TMNT
ahhh

the only xmen show that mattered
i loved thiss
I hated Evolution because Nightcrawler was secularized.
when the characters made sense
this is great
Wolverine from the jungles of Canada
Gambit <3
i always hated wolverines costume though
jubilee was a damisel in distress anyone agree?
My favorite ep of original TMNT was the aliens in the meatballs

Kitty Pryde all day errday.
Ads really

BUT YES, THIS SHOW
<3
lol i have a medabots gamecube games
Idk
game*
inb4 Beyblade/YuGiOh
MOAR POWAHHH
I think this came from the time when I'd actually avoid TV dubbed anime out of concern of overeditting
Scootaflew: I would work on your proportioning
It's a shame this show didn't catch up well
i liked that one
aw yeah
YES
YES!
oh gawd
Ah Static Shock
STATIC SHOCK
Ulysses 31?
i remember this
Season 2 intro
hey I ACTUALLY watched this one
YEEEEEEAAAAAAAH static shock
THIS WAS THE S***
can u play boondocks theme
weeping_pegasi82: Well still only my 3rd drawing. I've yet to figure out how to measure proportions
Me Gusta
These were the seasons when this show began to get... accpetable.
I put a SHOCK to your system~
<--- Now how Static Shock work
not*
Static shock was the bomb
Best Super Hero show based on an African Amercian kid.
Scootaflew: draw skeletons and outlines, it really helps
the last chapters were odd
I swear, the volume keeps getting lower and lower.
omg
HAHAHAA
YAY
Welp
XD
AHHHHHHHHHHHH
HAHAHAHAHA
We Tara now
YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!
Never mind, it was me.
I reckon the best super hero was The Tick
TEEN TITANS
AHAHHAHAA
TEEN TITANS
HI TEEN TITANS, YOUR RECENT REMAKE SUCKS.

TEEN TITANS
Hehe remember watching this so much several years ago
Fun fact: the voice of Beast Boy actually has a lovely singing voice <3
He has his own band.
Ah, Teen Titans. I liked this show, didn't love it.
Sumica: if we still count 2000 to 2002, max steel
weeping_pegasi82: I'm good at outlines and slightly good at undersketches. No good at skeletons
I heard the comic was like extremely serious
The last movie was goos
good
puffy ami yumi intro sumica?
Teen titans was the stuff
Scootaflew: well then practice
ami and yumi sing this right?
....
Yeah
cachi01|blackcops2: yeah

Raven was my favorite by far. Her sarcastic humor matched my own. ^^
oh that show
Loud....
BIG GUY
MURRICA
never could decide on it
/me salutes
i dont know how to answer coments
Oh god I miss this show.
Patriotism....
omg, my dad loved this
LadyCanary: they had thier own cartoon
Brain washing
to death
how bout some powerpuff girls theme?
CK|ded, lemme guess your favorite pony is Twilight?
I didn't like how Teen Titans was billed as anime-esque when the only thing that was anime-style was the facial expressions and the visual cliches.
Ryunosuke: OMG THAT YESSSSSS.
IKR
Hey, Sumica Bobby's World next plz
ew he looks ridiculous
Ah, I fondly remember Big Guy and Rusty.
o.o
CrystalPhoenix: Pinkie actually.

CK|ded, oh......ok nvm
Soulless_DCLXVI: naw, that's liberty prime
Hi Iron Giant..err Big Guy

Max Steel. Hm.
CrystalPhoenix: With Luna being up there too. Why, think I just liked her because Tara? :P

Reboot?
Ah
i watched this. was awesome enough
CK|ded, it was a possibility but heh
use all the nanoprobes
trying but i dont get anything
season one intro was better though
This suddenly made me think of code lyoko
CK|ded, also my top 3 is Rarity, Luna and Lyra
Max Steel was alright
Okay, I think I watched some of this but not from the beginning. My memories are too fuzzy for something like this.
00,10kinda shotty CG
Reboot was better
yeah the toys looked better if I remember
00,10Starship troopers was better
Heehee.
Has anyone ever seen Ulysses 31?
Sumica: Notreally. :P Compared to...you know, Johnny Quest :p
Troopers was cool
Sumica: in that period cgi kinda went down
Of course Reboot was better
And were SCARY when mad.
no death in starship troopers though

Dragon Pony Z!
PPGZ is actually a good show.
If this came to the us, I would burn cartoon network alive
so much bad hentai came from this show
LadyCanary: Don't care, great mix
i never heard of this
PPG was remade in Japan?
Sumica: cant decide if awesome or horrible
I hate THIS
I lean more on awesome
This is real. It even had an overarcing plotline. WHY, no9pony knows.
the song kicks ass
Japan just can't dub
SirGanjalf: it wasnt. only this spinoff. its not very good
i have lost even more respect for cartoon network
THIS COULD JUST BE THE WORST THING JAPAN EVER MADE
YES
CrystalPhoenix: What..Dub?
YESH
the intro is awesome but the series is shit
caps wups
Ah, better.
this is much better
WHAT DO YOU MEAN DUB!?

You guys should probably pay attention to your job
what is the name of this show
CTHULHU, Interstella 5555

You should have a picture of a parking meter that says, "$0.25 per min for Bronystate stream", Sumica.

Kandarihu, technically he's just lip-synching
why would they mmake a soace station in the shape of a guitar?

2001 much?
When I first heard Owl City, I actually thought it was early Daft Punk.
CrystalPhoenix, perhaps. Maybe
of cours ehtat works
because awesome that is
this is so odd
Dark_Horst, maybe the hull collects space dust, or radiation or something.
00,10not space station
bye thelonepony|HW, Conyst
o.O
00,10and he was polishing it
Kandarihu: then explain to me how you make a vaccum cleaner work in vacuum
<--- Dat love

lol i see where this is going
dat fantasy you mean
It's a brush

It may not be
the right time
so this is just one long music video?
I might not be
yah
the right one
CTHULHU: Eyup.mlp
so what are they?
Buytoast: Aliens
space smurfs
BBG is becoming the BBDG
Best Blue Dead Guy
There's something about us. <3
Buytoast: call them Space smurfs for now
alien rockstars?
He'll always be the BBG
it's like the wall.
I'll love you more than anyone in my life
<3
CTHULHU: or even Tommy
it would be funny if somepony created a file extension called mlp
>.>
now Papa smurf and smurfette are getting it on
00,10Death, it's a hell of a drug
cachi01|blackcops2, there's already an MLP programming language.
/me is now thinking of her wub. >///>
so we going to see Harlock or Galaxy 999 after this?
Kandarihu: yeah Fim+
<_<
Kandarihu: at first it started as a joke
Eddmario: whats tomy?
Kandarihu: then it became real
00,10lego band
oh no he dead
:(
mini-mates
now they rememeber
this song
them feels
CTHULHU: You've never heard of Tommy? It's The Who's rock opera that was adapted to a movie. Ever hear the song "Pinball Wizard"? That's what it's from.
:'(
Voyager
00,10Time to drive from newyork to england
and after that my most favorite song of the album
this one sounds at home in a 70's disco club
Then again, since it's being structured as letters to Princess Celestia, I'd imagine it might have file extensions such as ltc or fim.
yeah by the who.
Okay, the song AFTER this is my favorite one. I'm certain of it. Veridas Quo
Kandarihu, I love you
veridas quo is after this one
also it's Veridis Quo
00,10noting like driveing cross country in a stoled van with laser holes, blood and a dead body in it
ikr
so beautiful
and they burry him
this scene is beautiful though
The visuals <3
in a foreign planet
This is awesome too. A kickin' beat and baseline, with some ingeniusly elegant chord progression.
Sumica: That's what we do every x-mas on our way to our grandparents.
Kandarihu, Daft Punk
:'(
most modern matsumodo series have excellent visuals
burying someone?
THIS SCENE
so what's this called then?
CrystalPhoenix, I know it's Daft Punk.
FEELS
00,10bbg became space jesus
dat feels
nekkid
He died to save your asses.
00,10"what bbg is trying to evelove"
derpy_h: I think you mean *puts on sunglasses* DAFT feels!
Why is he called bbg?
00,10"congradulations your bbg has become space jesus"
Best Blue Guy?
XD
Best Blue Guy
Ah
Soulless_DCLXVI, I don't think he has a proper name.
I thought it stood for bick blue genitals
/me salutes blue guy/ smurf
*big
iirc, I think he's named shep
Lotsa 5s. Arc digit
00,10he never had a name but every one here called him bbg
I see

Very Chrono Trigger ey
Oh God, This song :3

00,10drive it like you stole it......wait
lol
Dracula's Castle?
chrono trigger
FlutterMEDIC, Darkwood Manor
I love dat gothic feel
Does Not Look Evil At All
What is a music band?
00,10good thing the evil lair of evil was on their tom tom
die monster. you dont belong in this world!
Kandarihu: i know, but it looks like something Dracula would live in
Java: a miserable pile of rythm?
and this is how I love my techno
Enough talk, now sing!
progressively
wait is the fat chubby guy the pied piper
No.. >_>
drummer
mmk
or pirate
one of the two
FlutterMEDIC, it's an evil castle. and the evil record producer is Dracula-esque enough anyway.
this is chrono trigger like
SECRET PASSAGE
FlutterMEDIC: Well, apparently the Bad Guy is a vampire, so you're not that wrong
Hm, I wonder if there's a Chrono Trigger mod that puts this in the game...
00,10and then you all understood
Mozart
And here's where the huge twist/plot pointcomes in.
:O
no not the cat people
dun dun duuuuuuuuuuun
He's been doing this for quite a while.
All the great musicians are space aliens... but apparently Daft Punk isn't.
Was that a Ferengi?
sacrifice ALL the children
oh noes
00,10he's done it 5554 times before
live forever on the backs of alien musicians
then they throw them into a volcano
Okay. Conquer the universe by stealing musicians. Heck-- There's been wierder plots in Anime before.
So those emmies carry mystical powers?
Mooooooooooo O3O
MOOOOOO
Ponies47: Moooooo O3O
Kencolt, it's original at least
NOOOOOO
Kencolt: And some of them actually made sense, depending on the anime in question.
Kencolt: You've seen enough tentacle to see where this is going?
one arm that bitch
IM BACK!
ded
I've seen enough anime to see tat the big bad's plan is about to go south.
world domination by records
head shot
Night all
The robuts did it.
BEWM, DOUBLE HEADSHOT
So, did they know those guards are robots?
And that's why record companies are evil, kids.
smeagle all over again
OOH.
and now THIS ACTION PUMPED SONG
Run away!!
SirGanjalf, not all record companies.
jump jump!
run now
Cults these days.
cheezit
SHORT CIRCUIT
suicide bots
and then they all died the end
They are all on about their rock and roll
But, of course, not before...
and lava
of nvm
it's the red lava gak
mood whiplash
I aproove of Suumicas Pony animation :D
lol ad
Priceless book? Lets just rip this page out.
Suzano, isnt it just the most adorable thing?
GAK
at the perfect moment
Ueah, it's cute.
that word kicks you
Yeah*
France VS Japan. I GET IT@
Im planing drawing her Rose :3
Idiot. >_>
mgs
And OH I SEE WHAT THEY DID THERE Eddmario XD
HA!
Gee, just one of those golden discs falling off the ledge blows up the whole castle. That accident could've happened 5554 times before, a little OSHA compliance might've stopped that.
00,10Cant wait to see
Lawl
hit man
Wow. Janitor midget got tall.
/me slaps himself around with a large seapony.
are you going to draw it omg adorbz?
well your in a queue XD i promised my friend 1st XD
"Aren't you a little tall for a janitor?"
2-1 France
oh noes
00,10Tazzed the black right out of him
Don't tase him, bro!
ded
OSHIT
dun dun duuuuuuuun
That is one crazy tazer
00,10meanwhile at mount doom
I have a friend who's a police chaplain. He talked to me about tasers. I think it might be funny to show him that out of context.
tentacoos
Barbetos: That was actually a "stun gun", a sort of proto-taser.
unf~
Face to Face
Kencolt, oh yeah. You're right.
now this is a good track
that is a strong taser
In this world, Darkwood is the only evil record producer. And the owner of the record company is a cool guy.
CONSPIRACY
hello
dat kid
what were the gold discs though? i was kinda watching two movies at once
DAT KID'S FACE!
Not the chip!
Aliens
What's goin on~
finally words
twilight_sprinkle: Symbol for greed
Love this song.
Vordox: so he needed 5555 of them just for fun?
twilight_sprinkle, hard to explain. They were awards for the best musicians, and they were also part of Darkwood's plot to gain the power to conquer the universe.
Kandarihu: i still dont get what the discs are, just some weapon for taking over?
Aw :3
So the rest of them were tased under friendlier terms
yay smurfs
I blue myself
Dethclock status
That's so cute!
http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/31793246.jpg - atleast he's right this time
twilight_sprinkle, I'm not entirely sure myself
It's no worse than the plot of Gattaiga, which was the Demon Motor Company plot to conquer earth by winning auto races.
Kandarihu twilight_sprinkle their memories unaltered where in those disks
http://i.imgur.com/JDcpp.jpg
00,10the disk was infused with the tallent and power of the artist
TheGreatAndPowerfulT, I see.
Real animes involve world domination of some sort
00,10with enough of them he could take over every thing
Barbetos, not all of them
too soon for a challenger joke?
evrything?
They were poopsed by Team Gettaiga, which drove five ver fast race cars that combined into.. one really big race car. Kind of a mix of Gatchaman and Speed Racer.
and now for the longest track of the album
Too long
yes it is
00,10KSP needs rail launches like that
cause this track is WAY TOO LONG
spaaaaaace!!!!!!!!!!!!!11
I wonder who did those vocals
Supa mang
Sumica: did he absorb their powers using the discs, or somehow they were already in the discs? and who made them adn why did he have to win them?
CrystalPhoenix, Daft Punk
Can you tell that the guy singing this is white and french?
oh no
Kandarihu, have they really?
13no i can't feel it
13CAN YOU FEEL IT NOW MISTER KRABS?
man they've lost their accent
Who?
Im feeling something alright Shizu
,ister krabs
Barbetos, Daft Punk
mister krabs*
OH SH-
o.
eww
vore.
seen enough hentai to know where this is going
00,10the have to some how be reconised as great artist and then he uses that machine he tosed the chick in to to extract it
BBG
;-;
i look away for a second a giant black ball with a head eats them
naked blue
O.O space high all over again
:O
NBG
;-;7
BBGJ
[]DeadpoolDash, everytime someone says that, it never becomes hentai.
Space jesus saving your ass again
Naked Blue Guy
hm ok thx for explaining Sumica
also mooning us
and paralel universe
so what is this music video called then?
o.O
BBG shall be missed
00,10and then she became creamed out when she found his porn stash of her
Buytoast, Interstella 5555
/me tips hat for BBG
00,10creaped out*
the album music video for Discovery by Daft Punk
this story mustve been written by thelonepony|HW
A deceased loved one to the record. That's pretty much Shinto.
super creeper fan
dat freudian slip sumi
Sumica: Creamed out seemed more sexual in nature
I think creamed'd be more accurate, lol
00,10indeed
twilight_sprinkle: No <_<
XD
Shizuke: We should watch Tommy next@
They don't bring his dead body back?
and the wall.
did stream died&
*?
Java, they do something better
nope
Java, it's nourishing plants on an alien planet now.
00,10and only too late they relised taht the space watch beafed up security and fired on any aproching ship
twilight_sprinkle: but i know thtat no one in productiton of this did not use any drugs, specificly pot <_<
ok nvm
CTHULHU: Doesn't The Wall require some drug use to watch though?
and then they jam
Blue nourishment
And then they shot down the plane
oh no its the space watch
Soylent Blue is aliens!
13bleh... daft punk is way way too repetitive...
thelonepony|HW: that much is obvious
They only beefed up security to the point where the space watch is keeping their eyes on the friggin' radar.
lets all play music and not fly the ship
it really but it dose make it a lot more awesome.
Beefed up security = turn around
XD
twilight_sprinkle: i know, i suck at lieing ._.
[]DeadpoolDash: It's on autopilot
00,10dont know how to land
[]DeadpoolDash, autopilot ftw
thelonepony|HW: *lying
twilight_sprinkle: thank you
/me smacks thelonepony|HW around a bit with a large cow
/me blocks the chancla
/me smacks twilight_sprinkle around .... damn it >:I
any landing you walk away from is a good landing
Sumica: time for the Launchpad Mcquack method
:3
/me slaps twilight_sprinkle with fish
And then they crashed and all died
FISHSLAPS
derpy_h: D: wat a tweeest
00,10they crashed in to a school for bunnys
any crash you can walk away from is a good one
/me slaps everypony in the chat with a wet noodle
:3
o.O
hi everypony
"is this a good time to mention, I may be a fantastic lead guitar-- but I don't know how to fly this thing?"
And then they bring back disease from earth and everyone died.
lol
>_>
don't move do you need it heh I need it too alright do you need it it's good for you
dat dancing pony has the right idea
6_9
/me dances
/me ducks noodle and throws tomato sauce at Eddmario
wonders how many human groupees they had sex with...
and then people started listening to dubstep....
Daft Punk. One lyric, an entire album.
dat ass
derpy_h, this ain't dubstep
/me pulls out garlic bread and uses it to scrape off the tomato sauce
6_9
/me eats garlic bread
I know you need it! Hey, I need it too! Well alright! I know you need it! It's good for yoooouuuuu! You're gonna move!
o.O i noticed
Kandarihu: rinse, repeat

so narcisstic, so cool
BBG = Big Bucking GUn
Handsome fella >///<
Big Blue Guy?
00,10and then the kick
always remember BBG
That's what he gets for coming back from the dead to save some musicians from the ghost of an evil alien music producer... a statue!
XD
and all this came from an imagination of one kid
AWWWWW!
that was trippy.
A kid imagining him dead?
OMG THOSE LITTLE DAFT PUNK DOLLS.

Ever read the fic?

thelonepony|HW: indeed. get the human trap!
bigmac: brohoof*
yes
yes?
I Hunger
the brohoove
I tarzan
U bring tarzan food
Conyst, my theory to that is the world on which Equestria lies has very short years... and a pony that takes good care of their bodies can live for hundreds of these years.
Oh derpy...

OH MY! On Saturdy, yeah
EDIT saturday
Sliverfish: well she will be on celestia radio, which will be streamed here
Will she be in the theatre?
no
and it will be after.... no
TRIVIA: This episode was recorded before the name Derpy became official, thus the reason why The Doctor calls her Ditzy.
and it will be after the Episode i might add
Sliverfish: some of the celestia radio interviewers will be the mods here though
Oh shit
Lol :P Cuc-koo cuc-koo
A problem you say
WE HAVE A PROBLEM!
well that was good back to sonic 2
Honestly, I wish it was officially Ditzy Doo.

Hey gaaaiiiiz

Gilligan Cut: a classic staple of comedy in which someone announces something forcefully and the scene immediately cuts to the same character doing something in direct contradiction to what he just said.
I want to watch Gilligan island now

It's a fitting name for a ship that was not meant to do anything but explode.
I see no way in which this ship can go wrong.
Or Fucknik. Because "fuck, it's gonna blow the fuck up"
fucknik

Dark92Enigma: wait, theres a MLP online?
thelonepony|HW: WAS.
CrystalPhoenix: nobody go's on?
Is there an engine that can just eat fuel like crazy and make massive thrust in a short time? That'll maximize everything.
thelonepony|HW: Not anymore.
superretroworld: COLD
add a warp drive
ah

Dark92Enigma: programmers got lazy
superretroworld, good try but that's very doubtful
superretroworld: NOT EVEN CLOSE
superretroworld, also DaringDerpy has posted the answer

Good eve/morn xles

Hi xles
0500, already made mornin' tea and all that jazz. Been up since 0415.
LOLNOPE
boom
they live
again
And this is why I love it when Sumi streams Kerbal Space Program.
^
The Aero-Space Execution Initiative is disappoint
xles, likeawinner
Oh Sumica, you and your Kerbal death machines <3
Kurra: Yeah, because all winners go up at bumfuck early to work minwage. ;)
XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
MINIMUM WAGE BROHOOF /)
Bumfuck early. Gotta remember that one.
Awright!
it flys
Kurra: (\
13yay artificially raising the price of labor!
Shizu!!
can't you try to simulate the Nasa spaceship?
hello Shizuka
13sorry... back to minecraft before i get embroiled in politics..
well then brohoof whatever wage there is, because wage is wage after all. D:
evening, Shizu
Kurra: Quite right.
Sumica, you fucked up AGAIN.
lol
Kurra: Glad I could get this shit job. =)
Artificially raising price of labor has some detrimental effects, it creates a lack of labor and a lack of money flow. :>
that lone rocket
which is weird, considering that you'd think minimum wage was made to make things more fair for people. Economics can be fascinating.
Sumica: yep
/me sighs
CLEARLY.
got some conservatives up in here
Oh, hi Hanako.
I would prefer if I managed to acquire a shitty job I was better suited for, like being the lowest level code monkey there is. But I wouldn't hire a hack programmer such as myself either. =D
well it's okay--
even worse than the liberals and that's saying something
:D
the most destructive effect of a high minimum wage is an extreme youth unemployment
^
Hanako, I live for the day when people see people as people, and no longer how liberal or conservative they are c:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vb3HxQgjZWQ
YES THAT DaringDerpy
I live for the day when people don't push their stupid and unworkable worldviews onto others
and also, you can't get as much done as you want. I know people who'd work for less than minwage, and it'd be such a great benefit for them still :s
I had pesto :d
dat video link
mmm, pesto
er, b:
No video links during stream
there it goes
ONCE MORE, WITH PEPTO
well there is a problem when one has to work 2-3 jobs just to hit the national poverty line
shut up lonepony
>_(\
oh: noa
naw*
:>
oh?
OH BROTHER THIS GUY STINKS
if you can not afford basic neccessities on minimum wage
oh, it is one of the regulations of channel c.c
and kick
something is wrong

They died.
OH, KICK! oh nooo dont kick

Whee!!

how much fuel left?
Tee und cafee.
DaringDerpy, green bars is fuel, red is... damamge or overheating I think
They moved the bus schedule around though, so now I get to catch a bus that leaves after 0600. Yay!
Coffee and tea sound good for next week ;A;

Hi Sketch_Toku_Brony :)
we need nuclear engine stuck with light engine
In the wierd side of my mind, there needs to be more pony OCs named less like characters from MLP and more like racehorses.
Kandarihu: lol can ya name a few?
Sketch_Toku_Brony, no. I've never seen it happen.
Kandarihu: So, kinda like "The Whistling Bushsnake"?
lol yeah like that :D
There are oddly enough, horses in races that have names such as "The -insert whatever here-
aaa
weylin|Blarg, that would be a good one to start. But more like the kinds of names that seem like they were simply made to troll the announcer.

It annoys me that SRWare Iron uses the Chromium engine, yet Adblock plus doesn't work on it...
ouo That's not how pyramids work..I'm pretty sure.
Knixys: Stargate. 'nuff said
Stallion_of_War, really? That's a problem
yeah... in your dreams
oh
whats funny is I didnt pay attention to that at all
Kandarihu: It's basically Chrome, but it doesn't report your data back to Google.
That's a perfect separation scene
Stallion_of_War, I know. I have it too. I don't use it much, though.
ouo XDDDDDDDDD
Kandarihu: I tried to use Off By One, but it's a little TOO lightweight...
guh, so tired and wanna abuse sweets
In the shadows, that looks awfully suggestive
You want to abuse swwetie belle?
Just... just do a barrel roll
No, more like sugar cookies. Java, eww on you man. >:C
i know, I'm just joking Kurra
Kandarihu: I tried using Firefox and either Chrome or SR and I noticed like, a 5 second stream lag with FF so...
Stallion_of_War, hmm, that's interesting.
Why not use Stainless?
penguins enjoying the night http://webcams.galveston.com/docs/penguins/penguinsmp.jpg?1355375578973
they are in SPACE
Who is Sumica responding to?
LUNA!!!!
yay
rawr
Sumica: lol
He's talking to the voices in his head
Nope Sumica, no you cant :P
inb4 yay
What's this Game?
Kerbal Space Program, Ta_Dikin
Kerbal Space Program.
TO THE MOOON
Luna?
Sumica: uhh what
/me Blows on a whistle OF WAR
/me STABALIZE ME! STABALIZE ME!
And in 100 years James T. Kerbal finds the space ship full of sleeping Kerbals, one of which is named Kahn...
wait, Luna? where?
KAAAAAAAAAAAAAHN-KERBAL!
OHH NOES HE'S NOT GOING TO MEET LUNA :'(
/me sleepy =.=
*cough*
^
You know why Sumi started this space program? To protect his jam from Brian Blessed.
Sumica: you thimk
*think
/me puts Kurra to bread :3
/me peanutbutters all over bread
kinky
He bought 48 jars of jam from the store, then put the jam in a cupboard, then took the cupboard off the wall and put it in a safe.
Space, the final frontier, These are the voyages of the starship Kerbalprise. Her ongoing mission: to explore strange new worlds, the seek out new life forms and noew civilizations, to boldy go where no kerbal has gone before.
/me chunky and rich, a yummy snack! Available at your local grocery.
And not die a horrible horrible deathc
Then he put the safe in a slightly larger safe and entered a random string of digits as the password; then burried the safe in the woods, and then tar and concrete'd the woods
tar nation approve of the use of tar here
then he dug up the woods and put them on this space ship, and now he's going to the moon to put the woods in a hole he's going to blast in the middle of the moon.
Sumica: you are
Brian Blessed is strangely obsessed with tubs of jell-yyyy? o/~
Then he's going to knock the moon out of orbit so it goes into deep space where an alien race will coat the moon in a diamond dome
And his jam will finally be safe from Brian Blessed
^
/me is entertained by Stallion_of_War, wants to see how long he can keep this up :D
Sumica: can you build some plans after this?
And then Sumica can come down and have jam on toast in the morning; only to realize that he can't because it's on the bloomin' moon that's in another galaxy...
*planes
Sumica: yay
yay
Umm so Pony ep every sat?
Mooo~ :S
cows in chat! get in the car
!c
Moonar orbit?

Its... its a LUNA r orbit!
Yay Rainbow dash episode!!!

Lol
We already had scootaloo episode
^
>_>
<_<
I liked last week's episode; Luna finally got a S3 episode

I think there might have been a chicken and some camping or something too
Sumica: what are you ging to with it?
I'm sickos
*going
AND YOU GUYS GOT Fluttershy TT
Just, just fly STRAIT into the moon Sumi, just fly STRAIGHT INTO IT
CRASH LAND AN LIVE WITH LUNA!
I want a fluttershy episode! :'(
ohh FFS the abbriviation triggers a chat ping too...
That's the whole point of abbriviations
Cause then you'd be a scottish levar burtan?
Or be Ganymede or Callisto
Sumica: game hates you
Maybe the ship is under acceleration since you're not sitting still?
break break
and this is where I'd put my atmosphere... IF I HAD ONE!
Don't hit Luna!!!
LAND ON THE MOON!
...
HAI MOOON
hello moon
...BYE MOON
crash
!You don't land on the moon?
Goodnight moon, Goodnight pony that lives on the moon, goodnight Sumica that went to the moon...
Sumica: land on the moon
Goodnight Bronies, EVERYWHERE :3

just push the pedal....
yay jewish music
/me chilling
Ahhh.
That was awesome
Had an amazing game of Natural Selection 2 for about an hour. Best match ever.
Yay!
/me we have achieved Lunar orbit; repeat; we have achieved lunar orbit
dat rocket
dat krebal face
that rocket is awesome.
So now Celestia's banishing people to the moon and making them provide their own transport?
bye fuel tanks
okay it works
I think now might be a little late to ask but... how are we going to get back home?
pretty much thing now placing on the moon... luna, whitley, whales...
Well, now to think about it...
O3O
Maybe we can just hitch a ride on the royale carriage
Lol
o3o
and hit Luna
/me Hello? One is her madgest Princess Luna
*majest
or w/e
Well, you're lucky if you get to the moon...
yay Luna's house
Say it with me folks
Ground control, to Major Tom
thats now how you get the moon, you just need to build cheese portal
it with me
nope
I think your kerbal has little confidence.
Major stone?
Java: XD
not *
schmancy feet
Java, you smart ass :P
activate Landing gear!!!
Going a wee bit fast dontcha think?
endgage musical saw
Oh look... Bannanas?
Slow down slow down!
I dunnoo
...AD
Yay~
that awkward symmetry to the lunar surface...
Well I dun play this game at all, so I will take your word for it.
We're going to need something to get home people
a paddle?
Sumica do you have gary oldman in there :D?
And will you demand that he 'gets off' your lunar module :p
...
Did you land?
...Hellos?
no
ssshhh
Still a good 2 km up
This is intense
this is the most important part
Coming in a bit hot capn
there we go
I am scured
scured?
Doh no
...
Awwww.
Sumica:ded
you're traveling to the right...
ded
Well that happened :p
neinneinneinneinneinnein
Lol
To.. da moon?
Well that was certianly a thing!
Celestia did it wrong.
hehehehe
lol
You move dat way
The ASEI has wired one billion Kerbal-Dollars to the KSP. You're Welcome
luna do not want your weir module there
He died
Sumica: what a wast of time and money
sad day
LOL flight errors: Died
No. We wanted to comPLANE
Get it.
EH?
*cough cough*
We have to get to warp 1 somehow!
Go into the ini
What are we? Federatiion fleet?
and edit the values
Done.
So how does Kerbal persuasion work? I'm sure they must need a lot to ride in these craft.
/me it's been a long time... gettin' from there to here!
Sumica: i remember when Phase4 made a car in plane building
you need front fins
No no no, you need to put the warp engines in the back, not wings
Sumica: wheels
not wheels, a giant moon plow
we need to plant moon wheat
Lol
How exactly did you expect us to make moon pies without a moon plow?
LUNA NEEDS HER MOON PIES
Shut up and take my money
Sumica: looks awlsome
it will ruin the aerodynamic of that plane
dat plane lol
helight
cant spell fpr crap
00,02Sumica, those panels will snap off in the atmosphere
*for
Howdy
00,02but it looks cool so DO IT!
Phase4: SHH dont tell him that!
hello Phase4
ohai SpadeKyurem[WoW]
We want to see the carnage
We all know how well things breaking off of spaceships is!
00,02XD
so many spelling mistakes X(
Sumica: Are you gonna accidentally the kerbals?
It never ends in firy doom or anything
Crud it's late; brain are no spelling
Just slap several JATOs and be done with it.
seems legit.
ahahahah
Lol
Solar.. panels?
We will use the power of the SUNNNNNNNN!
lol gone already
Oh dear
its shaking
sumon celestia!
/me gets popcorn
00,02that is a nice looking plane
Looks cool.
dis goin to be gud
Phase4: i like your car better
that doesn't sound good...
SAS WUT R U DOIN
SAS
STAHP
You need to put the wings on backwards
Do a barrel roll!
owowowowÃ§
He hit all da buttons
and butts
Yay!
00,02Weeeeee
Phase4: But it isnt water proof
DIVE DIVE
Going down!
airplane breakdance
Pull a tailspin.
Phase4: i would love to see that
POOF
Aww
splash
spoosh
did i see a rocket plane?
Splosh
10 points!
It has, as per kerbal design, great crash control.
^
Barbetos: of course, thats required by kerbal law
now we're talking!
front fins!
The moustache of planes
i'm off to bed. g'night all. it's been...a blast :D
*cough*
Now give it a mullet and a six pack
ARE YOU SHURE THIS VILL VORK?!
looking good, really good
Sumica: you think that will work
Then it will have good reason to crash.
mustache will make this 20% cooler
texasboykc09 - he built it, so the answer is yes
now "Will it work" is a compeltely different question
Sumica: Are you sure this vill work?
yay
the answer is always "maybe"
MirrorImage: you had to ping me when my sound is all the way up.
Popcorn anyone?
That kerbal does not appreciate the flight
Time to crash it
Sumica: ADD MOAR ROCKETS
MOAR
00,02^
now can you land it?
I bet most of the budget goes into crash safety.
Rockets solve everything
^^
Need more bacon too
barrol roll?
let me rephrase that...
can you land it "safely"?
GEDDAN!
https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-5RHWpBo4x_w/UMY7v5_LxPI/AAAAAAAAOuQ/Fy0Cpk7J5kU/s1600/TrixiesHearthsWarmingCarol.png
Thats normal
WHOA!
Shorten LINKS
00,02<< this is why i always add parachutes
twilight_sprinkle: So who would Bob Cratchit be?
^^
Phase4: Pansy
Doing it wrong phase.
It has bad lift control, but it looks cool. That's all that matter
Sumica: you dont:O
meh, the kerbal can die, save the plane
HERE IN MURICA WE DIES LIKE MENS
00,02i should try a powered landing mun misson one day
00,02i've got a craft that MIGHT be able to do it
If Sumica lands this I will be impressed
Barbetos: im pretty sure 4 line link is ok
twilight_sprinkle, "Now Trixie can we join you here?"
central rudder for stability?
Why not one line it when possible?
Better to not risk it
00,02yup
The...what?
00,02its awesome
Perfect for bomber planes though
Besides it don't matter, only if the mods get mad, eh twilight_sprinkle ?
Did I hear...flame..out?
i need to got to sleep, night everyone :)
Phase4 thunder
yes SpadeKyurem[WoW]
00,02had to shift fule mid flight to avoid crashing
get too high and there's no oxygen to burn
or not enough anyways
00,02JRP2234|Ghost, indeed, none here tnough
so engines go *poof*
put 6 jet engines?
00,02speaking of which, fuel transfer is awesome :3
Wait so actual physics are implemented?
Phase4 radar?
HE DID
0_o
IT
did not need em
wait, that worked?
de
Barbetos because when i have 35 tabs open, opening a link-shortening site is troublesome.
d
AMAZING!
doesn'tmatathadsex
Something broke
still nailed it
there goes the exhaust ports
What fell off?
Phase4: i should watch you play this soon
:close enough:
Hydrolics
nice landing
*cough*
I like the lad... rockets with plenty of tail
so.... basic
What is this game really called?
Kerbal Space Program
Hi! btw ^^
00,02in real life that breaks aerodynamics so bad, in the game though it migth work
what is that?
JATO? missiles?
i just wonder if he add parts for fasion or for better aerodynamic
Looks like speakers
^
*cough cough* two times
00,02Sumica, try clime to about 20KM and accelerate
^^
00,02this thing should make it to about 1.5KM/s
NEEDS MOAR BOOST
MOAR
00,02yeah, i probably assume too much
awesome bass for best rockets
You know what this ship needs?
More rockets
it needs more bass
"funny wing bit?" You can have a rubber chicken as a tail fin?
Sumica, if u use a sterringwheel and a joystick at the same time it's easyer to controll :D
i do <_<
and yet i'm too cheap to go buy the full version of this
I think I will call that plane Taurus Jet.....
now that plane is more horny
dat smoke
00,02i have to reboot quickly, hopefully i'm back before the interesting bits
lol
oh lawl
WELP
won't the pieces in the front make the airripple!
SO MUCH FOR HIM
Some one inform his widow
so much bass
boom ded
BOOOM
so what were those front engines for?
take off slowly
Slowly now'
00,02still o the runway?
he crashed
Phase4 - take 2
00,02ah
it's no longer a jet and now it's a bird
Yay
yep
MirrorImage: A glorious majestic bird
God speed bird
maybe the pieces in front of the engine
remove mustaches from front
00,02maybe the tailplane is blocking the exaust? it does simulate that
i'd bet it's those front wings are blocking airflow
move the tail plane up
or those turbines you have on the front
Oh god
dive dive dive!
*sploosh*
splash
lel
yah!
hope the kerbal know how to swim
make it like that old 70s jet!
Sabre?
yes!
there you go
and then the runway ends
yay!
xD
ded\
LOL
00,02XD
boom dead
the tail looks like F4 Phantom
lol
WELP
/me clapclaps XD
AND IT IS COOKED WELL DONE
Lololololololololololol
00,02BEST PLANE EVER
remove the horn?
^
deep fried
double the engines and try again?
well done Sumica I come back to GREATNESS
Sumica: bigger wings?
yay
YAY''
we need bigger plane
So who's gonna inform his wife?
bigger wings would only make the problem worse i would think
Perfect
cant handle that awesomeness
more surface to affect the aero
if anything, remove all the wings and just make a missile
^
MirrorImage: even missiles have stabilizer fins
pilot enjoing
yes, but they're extremely small
Sumica: is it upside down?
I dont think its going to make i though :P
a'www I lost audio
do a barrely roll
try flipping it upside-down? it might maintain altitude better
ouo: you did it wrong
no
it makes
sense
less
airripples
00,02might want to have the resources window open to check airflow
Sumica: GO TO THE MOON WITH IT
00,02its going to be getting a little low now
still in the atmosphere?
then suddenly no oxygen
DO YOU LIKE BANANAS
0_o
knew it
oh lord
00,02this is not so good
beware pony people, this weekend's episode has leaked onto the interwebs
lost an engine...
THE KERBAL IS GOING NUTS
BLOWOUT!
oh boy
look at him, the LOOK OF HORROR!

/me salutes
oh shi dis goin to be gud
Sumica: why not try an A-10 Warthog design?
00,02now land it :>
^
yay
i think he's ded
turn the engine back on again?
Where did the thruster go>
You got this.
00,02yeah, one way or another this will be on the ground
Sumica - make it a helicopter
yes you kan
I went to go get a drink and i find one engine gone, DA FAUCK HAPENED
OH SHIT

Splosh
try crash land.... nvm
GOD SPEED KERBAL #46745
big plane little splash
less speed this time?
MORE ROCKETS!
nah, more rockets
MORE SPEED
make sure the landing gear has clearance
this is not going to end well
ALL OF THE ENGINES
yay
the engines as been doubled!
Java: no it's gonna end KABOOM!
:3
^^
XD
00,02it'll be a close shave with that lading gear
put the landing gear on the rockets?
double thrust, double the fun
the extra trust will make it more unstable :(
6_9
Phase4: fuck landing gear
needs to be a ramp at the end of the runway
Sumica: aye, a ramp
ouo: exactly lol
yay
its times like these you need ductape
Lol
00,02nice takeoff
^
not like they needed that grass there anyways
MISILE!
00,02not sure how the intakes will behave with the extra drai
00,02drain;
i thought tail just cut off
"Well it does seem slightly more stabl.... nevermind"
00,02i need to work more with spaceplanes
oh crap
WELP
Sumica: BIGGER WINGS MAN
00,02XD
00,02dat speed
i would recomend a smaller engine
and the tail goes flying off in 3
2
Whats the speed?
1
Yay~
daaaaaamn
HOLY HELL
00,02yeah, air resistance doesnt scale right yet
sonic rainboom!
lol
SQUIRREL
The end must come.
Sumica: bigger wings dammit
I cant read the speedomiter
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: it's that thing in the top middle
00,02the sas tend to work really well in this version
00,02also you need a rudder :P
so... nose-dive into rainboom?
we dont need control, just do barrel rolls
GOTTA GO FAST
FASTER FASTER
OH SHIT

[]DeadpoolDash - neither do air/fuel engines, yet here we are
may ansver your questions
Arcium: HISSS lerning
00,02i've got some old ideas i should retry now with the new symetry
Sumica: you need to put on more eggs
needs moar gun
egg
inb4 to heavy
Â¨to much enines makes the craft too unstable
moar dakka dakka
taking bets on how long to crash landing
Murrican Eaglehawk, away!
lolz
hahahahahahah
00,02XD
MURICA FUCK YEA
Lolololololol
hahahahahahaha
00,02they went to space without you
^murica quality!
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: COMIN ALONG TO SAVE THE MUDER FUCKING DAY YAH
turn around and go find them?
yeah that how you finding useless parts
drag is going to kill those wings
it does look like a bird
I wasn't watching, what broke off?
./r "Ride of the Valkyries"
SpeccyRush: you look like a bird <_<
jup
the leading edges broke off
oh that movie XD
Yay~
:D
Sounds like Corneria music
CORNERIA!
Is anyone else hearing a small squeaking sound?
GO FOX!
its like a pretty bird
TO METEOS
I like swords
highspeed missile with lowspeed'n stress wings O.O
Sumica: you are flapping
Not so fast StarSumica!
XD
00,02uh oh
behold the mighty Seagull!
look at that Kerbal
00,02need to level out faster
he's TERRIFIED
00,02too late
SHIT
00,02oh dear
oops
doh
oh shite
00,10no air to turn in
oh no
00,02DO A BARRELL ROLL
AND GOD
quick! spin it the other way! maybe you can make it balance out!
one winged angel
Good luck landing that thing
EJECT STAR SUMICA EJECT!
also, i wasn't aware Kerbals were Korean...
00,02maybe if you spin more, you can make the ither wing fly off and land using the tailplane
How has the other wing not ripped off?
Flip it so that the wing serves as a fin and just wing it from there. Pun intended.
And thats whats happens kids when you use low speed and stress wings on a fastflying rocket!
the horror, the horror!!
i come back and Sumica is spinning out of control and missing a wing :D
00,02SpadeKyurem[WoW], "kerbals"
that looks fun
Lol
NocturnalBlade: me too
boomerang come back
Sumica: try one engine
What
'HOW
on the bright side all 4 engines work well
How
AdamTheDuck: so how are you mate
FIRE ALL ENGINES
wobble when you spin Sumica get that other wing off
DO IT
inb4 reattach
weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
WELP
uhhh...
00,02suddenly lavender town

BOOOOOOOOOOM GOES THE DYNAMITE!
00,02splat
drown
AdamTheDuck: awesome =3
Now where is the craft>
Find it
this song gave me nightmares ;~;
needs more duct tape
Ductape fixes everything
If it doesnt you;re doing it wrong
if ductape does not fix your not using enough!
needs some Slamvender Town
*cough cough*
mother of god
OSSAKUMAN!
MEGA MAN
still to musch engine powah!

Yay~
lolz

How much are the kerbals getting payed for this?
bootiful fireworks
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: nothing
05mornin
What about the company?
"here we go.. wait nevermind"
mornin Wrek
this will not end well...;
/me nuzzles Wrek
so much flexing
hi wrek
How the fuck are we getting funding for this?
00,02i think you need more duct tape
to much stress on wings! FLY SLOWER!
Butterfly
agreed Phase4
add my old foe
morning Wrek ^_^
its a pegasus floping
how was you night sleep Wrek
Phase4: if you can see the actual wing, there isn't enough duct tape?
00,02^
00,02i've actually had so many struts that it hid a stage once
now it stays togarther
00,02my graphics card was not fond of that craft
Ok bets on it ripping to shreds>
8-bit MLP!
mop
Sumica: Thats our man
fitting music
Breaking the impossible
i have a mop
Yay~ 8bit
Glitching the invisible
Row row fight the powah
no sonic boom?
00,02i think you're about to hit this crafts celing, only have the ram intakes
WELP
Java: sonic rian boom
sonic rainboom?
00,02lol, nicely timed
05i am considering farcry 3
BOOM
00,02not enough intakes
use less engine powah!
DED
Yay~
What keeps exploding?
how is it not breaking up?
So are we fucked?
00,02[]DeadpoolDash, sufficent duct tape
WHY IS THE KERBAL SMILING
05anyone got a selling point for it?
HOW CAN HE ENJOY THIS
madness set in
Winter wrap up, winter wrap up!
believe me this kerbal is never able to see the winter again
00,02if you sit at 13-15KM up you could probably cross the ocean
FIGHTTHE INVISIBLE
what kind of engines are those?
00,02returning to ksp?
Wrek, a lot better than Far Cry 2 apparently
00,02[]DeadpoolDash, jet
/me shivers at the boredom that came from Far Cry 2
Derp :P
Stahp
do they have ramjets and scramjets in the game?
/me puts a soft blakit on AdamTheDuck
00,02ok, hypothetically you could sit at altitude and cross the ocean
barrol roll!
00,02in practice though
those engines looks like d....... :ifyouknowwhatimean:
Phase4: you should build that ship that was able through glide through the air
Hahaha
when ever you play ksp that is
:P
00,02would work differently in 0.18
00,02its still in the game
Phase4: yes that one :$
00,02they've not changed the air physics all that much
carmen sandiego
looks like sumi might actually survive
00,02not only survive, i think sumi could land this
Oh my.
00,02it'll be a heck of alanding
land it...with a crash
Hey the Kerbal is happy.
it upside down
00,02the pilot looks happy
he's high as a kite
Lol
00,02yeah, thats part of the aerodynamics change, planes can go much further now
come on sumi you can land this
^
bye!
by Arcium
00,02but you're alredy mostly lined up

Phase4: Like the piliot?
God I've been at a rush to clean all night...I've been informed I'm having an inspection tomorrow and was only given a day's notice
00,02SpadeKyurem[WoW], him too
So who thinks the past few episodes have had too much fanservice?
MOAR ROCKETS
13too much?
If I was building this thing It would be coated in fucking rockets
so many duct tapes....
13you can never have too much SABISU SABISU
naww
Thank God Bronystate has the no spoiler rule, with the ep leaked I'm steering clear of it until Saturday like a normal person. At least I don't have to worry about talk of it popping up here
I hope the leak doesn't cause a loss in viewers though
J_E_Smith71: There's always one idiot
13oh i'm sure talk will pop up
Oh Celestia, the new ep is leaked?
13and so will a banhammer
Alzarath: The duel was. Sleepless wasn't really that much fanservice.
Ehehe....
WELP
oh the sweet ol' ban hammer
THAT WORKS SORT OF
00,02XD
there we go ^_^
00,02Perfect
ded
:D
lol
now you can only go up and down!
Sumica: You meant to do that right?
oh what
to the moon!!!!!
Alzarath: According to EqD yes, but I'm not looking for it. Gonna wait till Saturday
11,02Ta_Dikin: Moo~
Moo~
suddenly a SuperBrony64
/me pets SuperBrony64
/me bops SuperBrony64
It had Luna, Scootaloo/Rainbow Dash 'sisterhood', and quite a bit of darkness though, Kinixys.
J_E_Smith71: Inspection?
WELP
hahahahahaha
We're boned
kabom
Kinixys: Apartment inspection
Who needs 'em?
Tosses the engines like grenades.
I'd just like it if they toned down a little.
00,02engine v engine
bye engine
00,02engine wins
lel
/me is petted ^-^
Moo~ :S
So how long till we die?
/me boops Havok :3
All of us collectively? When was doomsday?
^.^
J_E_Smith71: Oh lovely.
00,02now try land msising one of the landing gear
Engines: "Screw you guys I'm outta here"
like a star wars
flap dem wings!
The engines are gonna make their own game
The kerbal looks terrified
xD
Kinixys: Yeah I know, and like I said they only gave me one day's notice this time. Even lovelier
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: lol you beat me to it
sweetie belle is best cow!
HOW ARE WE STILL ALIVE
J_E_Smith71: So they just want to give their tenents a hard time?
THIS THING IS NOT OSHA SAFE
dumb luck?
08,01http://i.imgur.com/nHi2R.jpg
00,02Sumica, if you close the intakes it reduces drag
land it
the fuck is that bit on the engine?
kittehs <3
00,02yeah
Kinixys: They do the inspections every now and then but usually they inform us weeks in advance
You lost a wheel
NOW THINGS GET INTETESTING
xD
land it
nailed it
Hey look, a wheel.
00,02Success
He survived xD
:D
Kinixys: What's even worse is that they posted it this afternoon, so I didn't see it until I came home this evening
yay~
perfect landing, again!
RIDE IT LIKE A UNICYCLE
*wheel retracts
Moo~
rofl
Possessed?
Alzarath: I dunno. Just putting Luna in an episode doesn't automatically make it fanservice.
to the base!!
inb4 unexpected 'splosion...
Are 90% of these survivals dumb luck?
00,02i like to imagine that this is how they retrive pods on kerbin
nope all skill~
:I
00,02they have them roll all the way home
<_<
J_E_Smith71: Well, hopefully it won't have you up all night.
Making her control the unconscious realm and be able to control ponies fears might. Then the obvious Scootaloo thing.
Sumica: Try to build a craft with nothing but engines
Kinixys: It's already 2 AM here:p
Looks, okay. Time to fly it
Is this the paid version of the game or the free demo? :O
J_E_Smith71: Same here!
if you attatch engines to both sides
paid
can you crush the cockpit
Alzarath: You're clearly reading too much into this
00,02i see where this is going
Always, SpadeKyurem[WoW]. But reading too into things is fun.
ahh Mica stream
WHEEL BOT
best 7am wake up music
YES
Alzarath: She controls fears?
also i feel like turning colour off
that Phase4 is a spy!
nekkid Phase4
13i guess you could say
he's posing as a regular
13you're going through your naked phase :P
She can basically control any emotion through ponies dreams, Kinixys.
PonyNegZero, i think not!
So is Luna Freddy now?
needs more eegs
Shizuka: :D
Shizuka, XDF
XD'
lol
close enough
Luna Kruger
ko
Luna Madden
Hollah Hollah
I like where this is going
would anyone like me to slip them a link to the new episode under the table?
lol
so what's the name of this game?
/me shoots XAX
No
ok
ded
Alzarath: I'll have to watch it again cause I missed the whole bit about her creating everyone's dreams for them.
ill go back to brack flops 2 now
dear kerbals
for what we are about to see
Lol
Kinixys: He's clearly reading far too much into this
we are eternally grateful
So who's going to break the news to the wives of all the kerbals we slaughtered?
Sumica, could copy it into the vab and do the radial symetry there
omg
https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/155899_403734559713359_785410034_n.jpg
Havok, D:
I never thought of that xD
Havok: you've never known that?
Havok: ALL I KNOW IS A LIE
did they remove the symetry modes?
also
dragonforce :)
neither did i
these guys are good live
that's a terrible way to eat tic tacs
dat dragonforce
Phase4, your colour. Its gone D:
you wont be able to get the last stragglers
Chrysalis, nah, just cant use radil symetry in the spaceplane hanger
it is, but I'm surprised that nobody knew that...
Havok, indeed
what could possibly go wrong?
we need more rainbow Phase4

08,01and the little crowny thingy
08,01and the wings
08,01and maybe just everything, actualy

08,01it's a programming language design and implementation exam
08,01so i have to be able to convert java to jvm bytecode in my head
Ouch. .__.
08,01it's okay, though; i'm well prepared
java... would drinking coffee help?
08,01and i'm quite good at the bytecode thing
chrysalis look cheese
who uses java anymore anyway? html5
08,01RoboGerbil: java is widely used pretty much everywhere
but... html5
08,01RoboGerbil: the two aren't even comparable.
08,01they're for different purposes
I feel sorry for whoever is named java in here... pingspam ahoy!

08,01i'd like to be a tree tree tree tree
08,01it's funny because abstract syntax trees
08,01there's a technique to convert ASTs into code called Maximal Munch

I am off now, take care everyone :)
Bye, Brovakiin|School. :)
Bye school
05i liek science
Enjoy school
djblazekin: They haven't explaned that yet, if I recall.
Science....
cuz at a pannle at pon3con mentioned that alicorns were only female royalty but that cant be entirely true cuz i mean heck there are male and female unicorns and pegusi so there's would be some genetic thing for a male alicorn to come around
it may happen
Unless they asexually reproduce which would sound so rediculous
That's the weirdest porn I ever saw...
!cd
Episode 7 of season 3 "Wonderbolt Academy" airs in 2 days, 4 hours, 4 minutes, 30 seconds (Dec 15 15:30:00 2012 UTC)
Java what in the world are you watching??
Genetical engineering?
hey i just met you and this is crazy so take a controller and game with me maybe?
xD
Embyro penetration :p
The episode got leaked, did you know that tom?
We know
not you
05and talkign about it is not allowed here
05Tom is also a bot
Don't give a damn, we want to savor the ga-k effect
That sounds so wrong and I despise science so I am soooo not getting into that shit heh
05talkign to him is pointless
are an ai too?
leaked eps isnt HD
ai ai ai ai ai
gonna have to wait for sunday for HD
Wrek: Wasn't there one case where someone leaked the entire plot of the episode in chat?
We want to watch it together on stream while pointig and laughing at stupid ads
*of an episode
05AJIsAwesome: doign such grants a permaban
aniderp|bestcakeever depends what game are you playing?
Tbh I miss a lot of scenes during live streaming, we're too busy talking about awesome stuff in the anime
cartoon
Wrek: now you know full well saying that tom is a bot won't deter them
soory a slip there
The Lizard?
oh wow
Spiderman enemy?
imagine if twilight did the mirorr pond cloning she'd probably become smarter than celestia and probably take over
All I heard from that was Venom is badass
Smarter? probably. wiser? no
Twilight = nervous wreck when there's lack of order
Wiser, of course not. Smarter? Probably not.
11,02i liek nintendo \:3/
I liek Sega
.....
Mario ftw
11,02moo o3o
11,02^
Ohai, SuperBrony64. Aren't you supposed to be asleep? XD
Sonic is cooler
what would the possibility of celestia handing twilight the throne and crown
Mario is more original
hey SuperBrony64 i got a message for you
Sonic is original too!
djblazekin: She wouldn't be able to handle it, in my opinion.
11,02I just pulled together a bunch of common, foil, tattoo, and standee cards of the MLP TCG to give to my cousin who likes the show :)
11,02aniderp|bestcakeever: Yesh? o3o
SuperBrony64: Hooray! :)
hey i just met you and this is crazy so here is a controller so game with me maybe? :D
11,02AJIsAwesome: /).(\
Mario is also what practically started games period
11,02aniderp|bestcakeever: I thought you'd never ask :D
/me noms on aniderp|bestcakeever
Actually Pong is the one who start gaming
mega man nuff said
/me noms back
11,02Tennis for Two started gaming
But it didn't get popular untill Mario was around
11,02Or probably the first cave man who decided to throw a ball at someone else.
Smashing dirt with club is what start gaming
11,02^
True
no technicly it was spacewar a mit super computer exclusive
11,02I could give the big history of gaming...but it would be so long~
super nes started my gaming
Dito
i think it was the super nes
Sega Genesis started my gaming
NES started my gaming. :)
duck hunt.. wheel of fortune
that sound like super nes?
aniderp|bestcakeever: NES. :)
oh
Golden Axe, Power Ranger...
my first game was mario at 1 yo
11,02But basically, a bunch of Game companies died off in 1983 when the big depression of gaming started. It wasn't until 1985 that Nintendo came along and fixed it.
then the nes started mine
Snes - Sega - xbox - gamecube - xbox 360 and Wi
*Wii
I'm a Sega fanboy who surrounded by Nintendo fanboy T_T
i was like 3 when i started playing
o.O
11,02I love NiGHTS
I never played NiGHTS. :<
NiGHTS is beautiful
05point is, we can grow organs
11,02AJIsAwesome: :<
05no more donating beyeetch
11,02ikr
I love REZ in my Dreamcast
Wrek: Do you mind showing more of these sometimes? I like these.
11,02I got REZ HD on my 360~
REZ? What's that?
Oh why Sega have to fall
remember when you blew across the game?
REZ is a game your girlfriend will love too
to have it work properly?
As long you bought the vibrating add on
Wouldn't that ruin the game?
idk o.o
i actually started with a ps1 and a game boy then a ps2 with gba then wii and psp with ds now ps3, 360 and wii with psv and 3ds xl
but people always did that..
The only RE I want to know and be a huge fan of is Resident Evil
I hear RE4 is great.
buys zelda for a crush.. starts dating then marry
xD
well 5:40 seems a good time to sleep, Night everyone
RE4 was a very good game but I just despised Leon
NIght, TheGreatAndPowerfulT. :)
gives the girl her zelda.. hopes she likes girls also.. if so she dates me then maybe marriage
re4 and revelations are good but 5 and 6 meh
you think it would be that easy?
RE 5 I thought was soso RE 6 was badass
aniderp|bestcakeever: Depends on the people and the relationship.
/me needs to find herself a gf with common intrests
my gf diggs cod l4d and re and persona
All of the above are epic except for COD
I like cod. It's a good tasting fish.
oh and the project diva games miku for the win
You know what I despise COD as a fish and as a game
i play a bit of everything from cod to re to beatmania and dance central and ddr to gta and final fantasy and starcraft
So you wouldn't want a game themed after a fish? :<
I bet you didn't play Dead Rising though
No because seafood tastes horrible all around
Not to me. I love seafood.
I hate shrimp. :I
05i love most kinds of food
05overall
Yeah keep the seafood away
i did play dead rising a pretty good zombie beat em up alongside case zero case west and 2 wich i still have yet to play
guys i got a book yesterday
Did I just seriously hear someone say Dead Rising was a good game??
i dont get some of it xD
well thats anoying
yes specter i was that one
/me likes books that he can't understand
i just flew a plane to the north pole in ksp
What's wrong with Dead Rising?
with more than half my fuel left
and when i laned my engines fell off
Phase4: Ouch.
hey Wrek session :)
i will say some of them
What is your reaction on episode 7 leached? :o
so, must apply more duct tape
Arcium, NO SPOILERS
i know
Arcium: It's happened before, I'm not surprised. Although, I hate the fact that it was.
its horrible
05Arcium: that talking about it in here is forbidden and i dont give a fuck if its leaked or not
That is honestly crazy I thought I was the only one who liked the DR series everyone always bitches and complains of how terrible the games are
the future comes one day at a time
yeah plus one of my friends thought it was a re ripoff
Hello Bronystate! :$
HI, MadSurge. :)
@wrek Hi ^^ im not a spolier :D Just asked what your reaction was :D
An re ripoff?? Your friend has no sense in games
MadSurge: i got a book
05Arcium: and i gave you my oppinion on it
AJIsAwesome:! D: Still insomniac?
aniderp|bestcakeever: which book?
its hard
@wrek Juup ;)
well i dont get somne of i
MadSurge: Eeyup. That and I slept for around 7 hours+ during the middle of the day.
My sleep clock's WAY thrown out of balance.
that was untill he played the demo then compaired it to being dawn of the dead the game
And it's all thanks to college. :D
AJIsAwesome: well at least you slept. I don't want you to start making baked bads. :D
MadSurge: At 4 o'clock in the morning, at that.
he forget about plastic surgery :/
the smartest funniest dumbest things ever said
Bye!
Bye, Arcium. :)
thats the name of the book
05plastic surgery is not important
AJIsAwesome: because you lost control of your life :D
Liz Taylor, not the best example
MadSurge: Yep. XD
DR is not ripping off Dawn of the dead damn it they even say they aren't ripping off the movie, the movie sucked anyways
ep was leaked :O wtf
05ouo: so?
didnt expect that
05its happened before
let sleeping dogs lie
oh, don't know about it
bullshit they did it for reason
Sleeping dogs = another good game
originaly known as true crime hong kong
05<--- only me finding this interesting?
Wrek: I find this interesting..
yeah
What interesting?
I'm just not talkative at the moment.
Spectre: Science stream.
sometimes hard to follow for me
Ah then probably since I dislike science and I don't use stream at all
mornin' everypony
Hi, SirGanjalf. :)
Hey hey
05Spectre: you disliek science?
05yet you still play games?
05tsk tsk
Wrek crazy isn't it but yes
05the hipocrisy is strong in this one
dislike science @ post about it into the internets
Damn straight it is
renewable
specter is on the path to the darkside of the force
animal
why am i repeating what he says?
But the darkside of the force is where all of the badasses are at
agree
05to summarise
does it float in the sky?
it said flating university
floating*
05i was considering to showing more of these now anda gain but they seem poorly recieved
Wrek: I'm guessing it's because it's early in the morning for Western viewers.
05yeh
05but my question is if you'd like more of them
I really enjoy these, I wouldn't mind seeing more of these.
05some of them are really itneresting
where is bill?
?
i might crash that 5 hour energy pink lemonade is about to wear off
bill bill bill nye the science guy
Wrek: how about more science? :)
05ill see if i can find a short one
aniderp|bestcakeever: Shizu streams that most of the time.
know
/me spent 30 min of my life too saw how theoretically turn sphere inside out
i know*
and it was pretty awesome
Bill is Shizu's material :D
05ok this one is relatively short
05and jsut brings out an interestign point
bill nye had a vd on yt about evolution and how we should accept it
workmates catch you
it's another big think vid

jorgen

Ah

if only college was free
Sure.
Pretty easy to outbeat Obama anyways since he sucks
Hello everypony!
Hi, Ponies47. :)
Hey Ponies
ponies go to bread
Spectre, he's very good at making people thinking he's good at being a good leader and that anyone who diagrees with him are evil.
Kandarihu that is very true
05Kandarihu, Spectre please dont start a political flamewar in here
05again
Wrek, we're not flaming.
Why would we we just agreed on the situation
05i said start
if celestia and luna were human and real they'd make a better president and vice president than obama or romney would've ever done
05not that you were
Djblazekin although that may be true Abraham Lincoln beats both Celestia and Luna by a mile
specter explain how
so many big words ;_;
Because he helped stop slavery
So do Celly and Luna
But Lincoln wasn't fictionally created though
celestia and luna would have sent al quida to the moon or sun
You need to honour other world leaders who also abolish slavery on other countries too then
nelso men dela
I didn't say I didn't
Nelson Mandela is a great man. His wife on the other hand....
Can you name other world leaders who abolish slavery too?

I think that woman just advocated murder... 6_9
Soulless_DCLXVI, I'd disagree with that
been on teamspeak with some nor/mlp/eople this evening. one of the guys is drawing a pony recreation of the portal 2 robots for someone. http://i2.minus.com/idUkHkzQvcOAJ.jpg
...they aristocrats
XAX: Looks nice. :)
So would I Kandarihu ... so would I.
Sex is no good
Soulless_DCLXVI, I meant to say that I'd disagree that she advocated murder.
I understand.
ouo: you should look at your partner, its prolly your problem
:D
I was saying that I was kidding.
hi guys
Hi, Alchemist. :)
Hey Alchemist
ohai Alchemist :)
whats with the 18+ stream? O.O
Alchemist: Older audienced themed show. :)
05coverign my own ass Alchemist
*audience
05nothing else
hai
Wrek: Is it there because you know /someone/ will complain about the stream content, and you've got it there to say they were warned?
Wrek: I suspected as much I just didnt know what show this was. Now I hear Penn's voice :D
o.o
.....
That was bad...
Now I see why we got the 18+ sign.
Actually, it went up when strippers first made an appearance.
05Soulless_DCLXVI: yeah forgot to tick it on when i started with this show
strippers shouldnt be 18+ material.
I see tv commercials which are more hardcore.
05you wouldnt want anotehr month of nothingness though rite?
05:P
Still, better to have your ass covered.
^
Indeed Wrek
Wrek: you are absolutely right, Im just saying that the rating system (18+, 16+ etc) is so inconsistent in the western world.
05heck
05you amurikans dont know whats best for ya :P
Well fuck, it looks like I can't stay here today :| mom is sending me to get a haircut all of a sudden
Alchemist, what is a stripper, but a woman who has no skill other than lowering herself to a mindless sex-object, just a target for mens' lust.
?
Really? What about tacos? Are tacos best for me? If not, than you may be right.
Might as well go there when I'm bald next time
Alchemist, yes you are.
Kandarihu: a bit rhetorical but sounds about right.
which chat we she be watching, bronystate or celestia radio?
will
Either one.
last time I was on celestia radio they were posting pron links there
haven't ate pizzas for months
no, years
or none. I guess she will just be on skype with the hosts
yah
me too
valoreins, it's been months for me.

Wrek, capitalism ho!
Wrek, that's what you said that Game of Thrones is made of, right?

And yet we're all huge fans of a cartoon that has only a little bit of cooking and much less of the others.
05why not jsut rebuild the towers?
05that should be the biggest fuck you to the oens that did it

poor man
kandarihu : we have a computerised one xD

Are you a lady?

<_<
mmmm sexy ponies
Arcium, awesome.
polygraph sounds like bs
PONIES ARE SEXY?!
next question
Alchemist: it really is
meybe
ouo : YOU KNOW TO MUCH
Bronysith: is polygraph testing still considered to be evidence in court?
actually they need do shoot that quistion on man before and after watching mlp
Alchemist: ill ask my friend whos in forensics
pretty sure reaction wouldn't be same
ouo : xD
she looks way more nervous then him
this is going to be gud
man face
mmmmm
lex luthor
he is so excitied
strippers...they strip
[]DeadpoolDash: yeah, they strip you of your money
SPAH
hello
unless you stay in the second row
and buy the 1 drink mininum
[]DeadpoolDash: that sounds so sad. :D
going to a strip club is kind of sad
lie detecters are bs
really
i agree []DeadpoolDash.
greate example in viva la bam
I've been to one once. Wasnt that great...
Its full of douches with baggage.
Even more so than regular clubs.
strip clubs are hubs for broken dreams, the strippers and the patrons
Agree []DeadpoolDash
48 life sentences?
okay, now thats just depressing :D
it is ins't it
sooo... maybe he's innocent
Bronysith, I believe a life sentence is 30 years.
its 25 here
[]DeadpoolDash: even though i've never been to one, i just watched it from TV
EVER
its true
/me prepared
how did pen know
Inb4 all of the AJ smileys

/me pulls out a riding crop "time to punish your ass"
/me looks at his ass too
/me spanks himself with the riding crop
are you enjoying yourself Bronysith ? :D
Hmm, if that trick can be spotted, the jig is up.
caviar is overrated
Bronysith Oi this is no such place for that :D
oh man so doomed
lawl
Asking "I did good?" is not a good sign after a polygraph test.
lap dance isnt sexual
STOP PLAYING WITH ANUS!
why must everything in P And teller be sexual Wrek ?
i'm going to bed everyone later
GOOD COP BAD COP

/me takes valoreins to bed
Bronysith: because......comedic relief?
oh... my..
bye djblazekin
If I were to try to deceive a polygraph machine, I think I have other ways other than this, which might not be so easily detected.
PICARD XD

/me grabs Wrek and blasts off
aniderp|bestcakeever, the nice thing about having an external IRC client is that I can move it over the stream when something that I personally don't want to see and don't have to comes up.
SUNE!

THEY TOOK ERR JERBS
bye aniderp|bestcakeever
i need to go home but i can't stop watching the stream
damnit Wrek!
Nowadays, videogames have to be COVERED in blodd to sell (most of them)
;)>_>
Dark92Enigma, try telling that to .notch
Heh Hillary
but DOES THIS MAKE US VIOLENT? I don't think so
BOOOOOOO!!!!
hahahahha
BARRED!
YAY!!!!!!!
and James Rolfe
personally, i don't think videogames make us violent
Is this going to be completely focused on one genre? I mean, I don't mind FPS games, but I play other genres.
AR-15s are pretty easy to handle
THE THREE STOOGES :D
ah
this one
nope videogames just timekiller, as anything else
ER MAR FURCKING GERDH
Ummmm no TF2?
it's fun and everything, over people do us violent :)
fuk eah
tf2 is cartoony so they probably didnt include it
ded
is he playing a ps2?
stream just <put sunglasses> got wreked
BOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Now barred :p
wow...polio
bullshed
This is before Jack Thompson was disbarred, right?
yep
wii
lol he is?
good to know
YAY!!!
fun!
Dat quake 4
fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun
then i was growing nobody it was happy years of blood and doom
Even though the "murder simulator" stigma has been debunked, there's still a backlash against video games. Now the stigma can be summed up as "digital narcotic"
gaben
Eeyup. This is entirely focused on a single genre.
dissapruve
asshole
This TV show is pretty biased....
yes.. COD players pretty violent
what kind of asshole is this?
FPS all the way
cus they kids, and playing boring games
Is this "Bu--sh-t"
KrazyNoobs: Eeeeyup
hai, KrazyNoobs :)
I kind committed genocide in games, but that doesn't mean I'm going to do that for real.
indeed
have
I started playing COD when I was 14, but that is old now... I only play TF2 now at 17. btw, hi ouo
she is talking about addiction, and not about games turning kids violent
i never played COD, is that good in some way?
SCIENCE
05stay away from cod
05tuna is better
valoreins: I hear the early games were good. I was never really into it.
he did science lol
To tell the truth, I hate those 7 - 13 year olds that play violent video games...
simpleton cod
a bug XD
sod
troubled kid is the primary reason there
But I like cod. It's a pretty good-tasting fish. :<
simpleton sod with simpleton science
Valoreins For a young kid, COD is good, but it really isn't anything special. TF2 is actually good
it was ok
before it became mainstream
You know, I do like the scenario-based FPSes. The ones where you really have a proper justification for the things you do, killing or otherwise.
^
yeah, cut that kid
Bill Clinton is a good politician, Hilarry? not so much
That engineer's a SPY!
I loved GTA Vice city. am I a psychopath?
I remember when I played Timesplitters 2. There was a part where you grab a fire extinguisher to put out fires, and the thing works the SAME WAY as a gun! I just thought that was the most genius thing around.
engenier
dem lan parties
>
05actually
oh
05a distinct difference between spycopaths and "normal" people
Dark92Enigma: according to some delusional bitter old people you do.
o rly?
05is that if you have a train track, and a train is coming, and if it continues 5 peopel will die. but you can press a button that diverts it to anotehr track, but on that track 1 person will die
This show is rather entertaining
Alchemist what credibility do they have?
I honestly hope this show goes into Penn's contribution to the industry. The one that Loading Ready Run makes good use of every November.
05pushign the button would both to normal people and spycopaths be relatively easy
055 > 1
im a sociopath
05however
05if it didnt involve a button
05but that you had to push someone over the rail
Dark92Enigma: null. they have good rhetoric though and they prey on easily scared parents.
05and onto the tracks
05instead
05of a button
i played that games with trains
and twinkies
i have a link
05a spychopath would do it as easely as pushign the button
Wrek: When you say that three-letter g-word, do you get kicked by yourself?
The thing is, the victims of school shootings ALSO play violent video games.
c:
05wherethars a normal person wouldnt
is there a way to get two trains?
Wrek: did you watch the bigthink video about it?
05gak?
05Alchemist: yeh :P
with a 6 kill streak i just need to shoot somone to get my chopper
Did you get a paddlin', Wrek?
05nope
lol
Wrek: there is a 3 part lecture of this particular issue on YT (I think Harward lectures) if you are interested.
There was an online gaming service in the 1990s that had a tagline "Taking violence on the streets and putting it on the internet." I loved that slogan.
I shouldn't be proud of this, but I was kick #2000 and #2222... ensuring that happened was a waste of my time, really.
R.I.P. Heat.net
frendchip
nice spread
btw, I have a question: If Season 3 Episode 7 was leaked, why would watching it be considered a spoiler, IF IT IS ALREADY OUT in its entirity?
2 more days
gak is still kick word?
yeup
ouo dat kick
yes
KrazyNoobs Cause it's not officially out?
it is
police right behind them
KrazyNoobs: Because it's technically not aired yet on its intended date.
wasnt it leaked rather than officially released?
.......woah. Okay. I... I kinda promised to myself that I wouldn't do links of any kind for a while since that incident last Saturday. I think 24 hours would be enough.
Alchemist: Leaked.
killerpony7733 but it is out as a whole, it doesn't need to be "official"... well, that is my opinion though, but before I watched it, I just wanted to ask the question.
Fine, I won't watch it. I will show respect to the makers by watching it on here.
05KrazyNoobs: because of one word in that sentence
05leaked
Wrek Did you read my comment? The one above yours?
beta c-mag
I shouldn't watch it, anyway, that is "cheating"
nut job
a hypocritical nut job
KrazyNoobs, mee tooo, i'll wait end of week
ouo I'd rather watch it here, but there will be some trolls that will spoil it for us on the day...
in the caht
Are bronystate going to stream the official release?
*chat
fuk i sitting at work cus stream doesn't stop
I don't see that as hypocritical. He values the 2nd Amendment, because he expects everyone to be using firearms RESPONSIBLY. And he's prejudiced against gamers because he believes that anyone who plays FPSes can't be trusted with a gun.
That's Ron Jeremy?
Arcium Yes, they broadcast The Hub, and watch the new episode. Also, there will be a LITTLE surprise during this week's commercial break. The chat will explode
:D
coulda dislocated his damn arm and jaw
KrazyNoobs: do you know when they do it?
Wait till the end people
.223 and 5.56 dont kick very hard, he didnt have it shouldered correctly
I think they use ammo with less gunpowder
It gets better
so it will be less recoil
there was a famous video of a kid shooting a mac10/uzi set in full auto and it spun around on his finger an killed him
KrazyNoobs, how did you know about commercials in new episode?
FPS with a touchpad. The horrors
05.306
Arcium There is a timer on the home page... 12 hours before the episode will air at 10:00am EST (Middle USA), a timer will show on the livestream page
05now dats a kicker
if you didn't see that
mmkay :D
.308 isnt too bad
ouo I talked to the --- company themselves on FB
cyber athletic leaguew
oh
ouo They said The Hub will show it again on Dec 14
Wow. You seriously have a problem.
what FB?
You need to get over your obsession with that.
Bye :D
It is getting pretty shit.
football is more dangerous than paintball
Also encouraged by parents.
there only been 2 recorded deaths in paintball
Watch this
It gets really good now
oh i got it
6_9
Jmo I know, the only reason I am still attached to the squishable stuff is that I am currently working hard on a YTPMV, although I am 4 weeks late... Yeah, I'll also admit it is getting pretty stupid
and here's the twist of the knife
silly me
:D
Seriously man. You get on everyday and talk about it.
what happened with him?
i got scared to shoot a sks once
he just killed someone?
i pooped me pantalones
Java: he got traumatized
oh....
Because Football is perfectly normal for guys to gather in front of a TV and drink beer every Sunday, but video games are a "digital narcotic" now.
well i got feels
the gun scared him cause he didnt have it shouldered right
actually........why the fuck am i laughing?
well
:'(
they are a narcotic
Tbh I want to see this show talk about other games than FPS :(
Wrek: please explain to those that don't understand why he was crying
i'm going home now
i played cs since like 99
it is a drug
dare stream i miss something interesting!
WHAT have i done
I'VE KILLED THE WABBIT!
I know they defend video games, but it looks like FPS is the only video game out there
Jmo Yeah, it is only funny when the ad is actually on... at other times, it can be quite annoying.
why do they always target FPS as violent games? why not roleplaying games? :s
Poor little wabbit......poor little wabbit :'(
ultima online was pretty brutal the pking
FPS = easy target
you can get addicted to ANYTHING that gives you pleasure. highlighting some of these stuff as narcotics is misleading.
i remember blood
it was my faforite fps
FPS usually have the most graphic violence
but i didn't became a psycho o something
old intro! :)
I don't understand Fung Shei either...
Wrek Isn't there more then a few of those we have seen of pen and teller so far?
If violence video game actually make us all psycho I bet the street will be littered with murderous psycopath...
But no
Java, to prove a point about the effects of video games, they actually made a game called Desert Bus that's about driving a bus from Tuscon to Las Vegas and back. It's an eight hour drive and the game runs in REAL TIME! There's no pause, stopping the bus causes the engine to stall, and veering off the road causes the bus to crash.
05huh?
what?
The bus also veers naturally to the right so you have to be intelligently steering the whole eight hours.
I bet it will cause violence more. All the rage
amusingly i got motivated into a graphic designer because of video games, so graphic design field we'll get many psychopaths
:D
I'm a graphic designer grad too :p
The point of Desert Bus is that the game doesn't make people any better at marathon drivers than FPSes make people more violent.
murder all the logo!
SCIENCE!!!
Wrek: someponies didn't get the ending from last episode.......i did, too late :(
/me dries his tears
Every mid-november, Loading Ready Run does a charity event called Desert Bus for Hope that benefits Childs Play
I'm not Chinese, but as an Asian I have several Chinese friends and they all said that those FengShui "locations" are bullshit. Real one isn't like that.
STupid "science" is stupid
wrek did i miss johny?
dat science
lolz
that's bullshit
turtle?
WTF?
Yup... anything that isn't science in a nutshell
ew
That turtle only guard one of the gate, that's all!
turtle turtle turtle
Just people saying/believing things they think they excel at... it's all in their head
inb4 i liek turtles
oh watch this
way to ruin the flow there guy
valoreins is a zombie
They made sure to videotape those bastards
/me becomes a zombie
/me runs from valoreins
OH DON'T YOU TALK ABOUT MY TURTLES!"
I LIKE TURTLES!
/me noms Krazynoobs
BULLSHIT!
/me becomes zombie
/me likes turtles
what?
Bordello?
lolz
they should refurnish the apartment in accodance with one the guides and they should call in another feng shui guide into the refurnished one and watch them override each other's setups.
P LOADBLOCKS: DATA FAILURE
I wonder if the admins will kick people who give spoilers about S3E7 before the episode's official air?
I hope so
awkward silence is awkward
move the stuff to make more money in his wallet
DR ASHENS
i'd prefer watching the new ep here, with you guys <3
Real Feng Shui is not like this at all :(
they really ruin real FengShui
Those people are opportunistic assholes
If people only followed REAL science, our world would be a much more accurate place.
Come as you are
nice haircut
Feng Shui is more of an art than a science.
Conduct studies, and make a hypothesis... that would be how to find the best way to decorate. Obviously, the answer would be, "to the decorator's desire".
hey guys
hi jbh1145
Kandarihu: and thats nice, the problem is when people pass it as science
lol penn and teller
Alchemist, indeed.
which pen and teller episode is this?
What episode of bullshit is this?
Feng Shui, jbh1145
dat energy
okay
05i smell dinner
Seems legit
Oh boy
legit
/me charges energy
is this the one show exploring myths and stories and such? Cant remember the name...
I can SEE the energy flowing through the room

I hate this David guy, using his "asianness" to sell bullshit fengshui
put the one where they talk about the 2012 apcolypse, that one is awesome
NAME: Fred Express
Java true dat
nickname: FredEx
does that image tag include spoiler?
I only read the url
SeaponiesofLiverpool: What episode is that screenshot from? :)
um. no >_>
i already seen the new episode :D but i wont spoil anything
I am starting to think that some people that specialize in "FengShui" are using "the science" and "the energy" to sell their products, such as Fountains
SeaponiesofLiverpool Oh boy not good
Do you need a license to do Feng Shui?
WTF? Im changing professions this instant. Im sure I could sell it as science more effectively as these nutjobs.
Don't link unaired episodes
^
I'm going to say again, real Fengshui is not like this
^
okay
^ TRUE DAT

the bronystate outfit must assemble
and test the horns at the local warp gate
At the same time
Its to ensure it is working as intended, to annoy the hell out of everyone.

Magical_Pablez94: If you're speaking about yellow snow...
a succubus has to keep her strenght up after all
I still think It's Bullshit that Germany is not there but France is...
SirGanjalf talking about normal snow! when it's snowing air smells different than when it rains or when it's normal.
Wrek: what season is this?
056 i think
Magical_Pablez94: Yeah, but clean snow is basicly frozen water, so it shouldn'y have smell at all. You're maybe speaking about the smell of ozone, which is perceptible after rain

great music videos XD

00,10bad file
works now
00,10oh you meen with MPC
05yeh
Wrek sounds fine
00,10funny thing is this ep will go over much better now then when it came out
whys that?
05JRP2234 you dont knwo what we are talkign about
o i thought you ment the stream
05sumica does it right
05rocksalt
rocksalt?
00,10yep rocksalt

00,10it's a warning shot round that I keep chanbered in my spaz12
I'd get the boobs bumper sticker
oh, beanbags
rocksalt, it'll hurt like hell with the added bonus of being able to fend off errant spirits with
05i dont want numbers when i hear murders in a country
00,10will sting like crazy but wont kill unless close range
05i want a percentage
05with a percentage
hehe, "ballistic"
05you can compare to otehr countries
wrek because were idoits
00,10also it's only home defence if the body lands in the home
05i can see it from your view though and all
05for isntance
00,10and it's no longer self defence if you reload
05sumi got a shotgun
05sure
05handguns and revilvers? sure
05but i see no real reason to have fullblown assault rifles
05thats a bit overkill
if you are of able body, and an adult, and you cannot defend yourself
dont expext to be defended
00,10loaded stastic
0587% of all statistics are made up
05take them with salt
i have an assault rifle
05rocksalt maybe
00,10that's like saying 75% of all car wrecks happen withen 5 miles of home
and an RPG but thats for recreational use
its chef
00,10of corse more wrecks happen close to home you spend more time there
100% of all wreks live within 2 miles of their homes
00,10the northholiwood sgooting I watched happen live
this is a bit of a sesitive issue, isn't it?
00,10one of the guys shot him self in the face trying to look down the barrle of his gun to see what it jamed on
00,10nice carbine
you dont need to outrigth ban guns. but selling them to every dipshit htat walks into the store is a problem too
because he's and idiot

I dont have a bible
hypersexual
00,10I see what you did
pan sexual~
the shit is in the pot, the stove is ready
let'S cook it up!
05yeah

That Bullshit wine

Well, I'm supposed to be honorbanned right now.
05i gould give you a real ban if that helps
Honor...banned?
ooh, bullshit. how did you know? :P
AttackWithHugs: Banned with Honor :P
thelonepony, how does that even work? I've never head of it
in b4 shitstorm
AttackWithHugs: not sure either :D
pizza? :)
where's my bible?
british!
AttackWithHugs: Purposely ban yourself in response of a prevoius action, if I remember correctly.
pizza, yum...
*prevoius
AttackWithHugs, I personally agree to behave as if I were banned, since I'm ashamed of something I've done or said even though I didn't get banned for real.
AJIsAwesome: ah, i see
*previous
HA
talking about the bible
without even saying if it's true or not, how many of these people have actually read the bible?
Kandarihu: Ooh. So a "time-out"?
lolololo
oh, just ban him already
=p
lol
00,10start at the begening, book open to middle
i always wanted to try out the sega genesis :\
Alchemist: i havent, and tbh, i dont care for my religion
Sumica: maybe the first part is the "thanks to..." section.
o_O
:D
00,10big ass apple
AJ might not like what role the apple plays in that story :X
00,10he did't die, he just went home
thats my apple!
I can't have the audio for the stream right now, but I do have something that needs explaining, and I'll explain at the end of this.
AJ would have bucked that apple the f*ck down without the snake tempting her
elvise was always a zombie
dont forget a half cup of blood
dat stream x.x
00,10amount of flour dont matter
i always add blood to my recepies
yay elvis <3
00,10you could call for a lb of flour
hungarian bloodsausage
bloody deliciousy
00,10it would not matter cause you only use what sticks to the chicken
*badum, tss*
05tried swedish blood pudding Dark_Horst? is awesome with ligonberry jam
gotta write that down
00,10big boat
this guy is gonna make me lol
he makes every excuse for an illogical story
gtg
And the whole "something coming out of nothing" gets a free pass, though.
?
00,10well they have to suspend some disbleafe just to get the story rolling Kandarihu
Sumica, that's how atheists try to explain the beginning of the universe.
05not really
Kandarihu: its not proven yet
maybe never will
05i personalyl believe a big bang occurs every time a black hoel collapses
i like magic
05theres evidence that the mass of black hoels corrode over time
:o
05untill a point where its so small it implodes upon itself
05im no scientist
05but it seesm plausible
00,10that almost sounds the start of a relegion wrek. Some one beleaveing somthing
05as for intelligent life
thats a bit over simplified but why not?
05its severly oversimplified
05but dust becoming planets over the course of shit
05cant be arsed to explain in detail
05single cell organsisms becoming bigger over time
05we didnt start intellectual
Hey, gaaaiiiiiz
05took some time
i say the people thinking we'e the only intelligent life out there are the nutjobs
seriously
^
05michio otako explaisn it ratehr well Dark92Enigma
05Dark_Horst
we cant even imagine how many fircking stars there are in the universe
Wrek: here its explained how its possible for "unguided mass" to become organic material.
http://exploringorigins.org/protocell.html
Technically, dolphins are as intelligent as humans, but they don't have civilization, though.
beleiveing we're the only happy coincidence is... well, bullshit
Wrek: of that one i never heard
Kandarihu: whats the quantifier of intelligence?
05we have 2 flukes
05opposign thumbs
05and a basic primal instinct of beign in large groups
05the cohesion of large groups
05is needed to have civilization
00,10one thing I like about this show
xD
00,10you dont have to watch it
00,10you can just listen
Kandarihu: I didnt say such thing, I just asked.
05ah yes
Je'sus? is that, like, a klingon messias or somethin?
Alchemist, this is the first time I've ever heard of "quantifier of intelligence".
ahah
05it was stephen hawking that discovered the concept of the particles that erode the mass of the lump that is a black hole
actual footage XD
What is this crapola :l
Okey~ lol
Wrek, have you heard of a game called Don't starve? that would be extremely entertaining to watch.
i'm pretty sure they nicked his corpse
05Malmortius: i have
people do funny stuff like that to messias folks
05and im really wanting to play it
Kandarihu: what I wanted to ask, how did they measure and conclude that dolphins are as intelligent as humans.
i wanna play it too
Its amazing.
05anotehr fluke
Kandarihu: because I dont know.
05is language
05the way humans commune
05that
05plus thumbs
Why don't you buy it Wrek? Its pretty cheap.
05plus the need of human company ie groups
05=civilization
meh, talks about religion bore me :X
Alchemist, oh, sorry. I think it's because they have language that can equate to human speech and have been known to be capable of morality an altruism.
You get 2 copies btw, Wrek.
I recieved mine from a friend :P
Kandarihu: i didnt know their 2language" was that complex.
Woot, Wrek Session! What is this ep on??
bible
05RaveBrony aye i fixed the session logo
Sweet : D
ten commandments? dont be an asshole. that's all ten there
05no black shitty unproffesional look
05the first ammendment is self policing
05the rest are covered in it
yay elvis <3
he's just saying no one can tell all ten
So, the Bible is bullshit?
it's only just killing
RaveBrony, You can say that
I see :P
Ok, maybe not stone to death. But kids are too out of order today...
Interesting.

05Kandarihu: i should show his bigthink interview

Wrek: penn redux?
05realyl shows how he's changed over the years
/me kidnamps PoniesSchool47 and fluffies his mane

Hi, PoniesSchool47. :)
Kandarihu: creatiuonists do

johny
"click"
And hello there MLP_Brovakiin, how art thou.
Kandarihu: or were those a splinter group?
lets watch shoo be doo now that some jimmies are rustled

Good thanks Panda, how are you? :)
Hi, Panda. :)
MLP_Brovakiin, sick and pissed off haha.

The new trolling vids should be watching "Mr. Ed"
AJIsAwesome, hello again.
Panda: Ouch. Hope you feel better. :<
10 am over here
and now I must run~
Dark_Horst, there's that floating around. It's called Young Earth Creationism. Personally, I don't believe in it. I think God has a sort of time dilation where a day for him is many many years for us.
Panda: You said that you wanted my Skype name?
Panda: Ohh, I hope you feel better soon buddy :)
Bye~
Bye PoniesSchool47 :)
here's some food for thought: What was the measurement for one day when God was creating the Earth? Could it be that one day for God is thousands of years?
hope you feel better, panda. i had one hell of an illness about a week ago myself
While Mr. Ed is a Great show, it would still rustle the newbies jimmies.
Meh, it's just the seasonal flu. Nothing too drastic.
i wants some russled jimmies!
i blamed it on chinese food that i ate before that :X
RaveBrony anything non-pony would rustle the jimmies of the newfags.
get em russeled!
Panda: Very true! :D
But Mr. Ed is a horse of course :3
APPAJAK: then watch the comment section of any video on YT that deals with religion or atheism
RaveBrony, btw, how is Sai treating you so far?
moozik

/me backs away slowly
it was a ballpark figure on my part :P
I'm going to avoid the leak and wait til saturday
And I'm guessing some people will be jerks and attempt to spoil it in manechat as well. :|
Wrek: ever thought about oputting dash in conglomerate armor?
05dash isnt a conglomerate
who is then?
AJIsAwesome: Which is why I won't be on manechat

oh
<-- Sparta kick before Sparta :D
dat kick
he was all like
FUCK YO COWCH"
Wrek: :$ you'd wish i could change my nickname....
Dat mouth
heck.... the Reason Genkis Kahn was able to conquer Europe even after he already fought China, India, and Russia was because his fast Arrow-Shooter(I temporarely forgot the right term there) slaughtered the european heavy-armor knights
Vordox: THIS! IS! A COINCIDENCE!
Horse archer units
Dark92Enigma: :D
They ride their horses since they were infant
Lil_B: um im pretty sure he never conquered russia
And then the Klingons give the Danes black powder muskets
pony sized horses
fast and swift
Stallion_of_War: implying klingons wouldnt get eaten by swedes
D:
DU KOM HJEM!
twilight_sprinkle he did , or at least big parts
Klingons are good melee fighters; they'd at least achieve mutual distrucition DaringDerpy

Lil_B: well at the time it was called kievan rus, and it had some armies, but there were internal conflicts. it was attacked from 3 sides, moscow empire, poland, and the turks, so it was a bad place
He's dying Jim

Wrek: Thank you for sharing the cinema of your native land
05yeah it wont get better than this
05the rest is pretty crap

That's a good movie, even when they need to cut the battle because of budget .
Wrek: Perhaps some Bergman next?
twilight_sprinkle: I like it. Thanks! :)
Thanks Wrek, was pretty interesting
he just played us the movies of hi people
Maybe we can play one from my native land - I.E. Murdering the natives and introducing plague... such a proud history (MASSIVE SARCASM)

GnomeWithMushroom: So you're not familiar with this mush of English we use here in the US, ehh?
Wrex, I know this is kinda selfish for me, but I think you need to show The Raid: Redemption here? at night of course because of violence
Basically US English is like Chex Party Mix. It has some stuff in it you recognize and a lot of weird bits.
05i would
Pffft, bacon.

And play hard
MadSurge: vanu have fast reloads and no to very little bullet drop, but their damage decreases over distance. NC hit hard but hae heavy recoil and slow firerated. terrans have i firerates, low spread and less damage per bullet
00,10VS have lasers pew pew

Hope you feel better, kidzrul732.
Good idea, it's a horrible idea to come to a place with tons of people if you want to be alone.
Why do people spoil MLP, they must be bronys or they wouldn't be watching MLP and if they're bronys then they must love and tolerate and be kind SO WHY ARE THEY SPOILING!
