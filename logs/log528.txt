I can't really get this because I've never been rejected.

I experienced it... wait... 1.... 2.... maybe 3 times
Magic ew
no you shutup
Yeah well, to be rejected you have to offer.
i have exp rejection well i have no clue how many time
id say the thing that hurts more than rejection is a bad breakup
Ive been rejected 1 time
fish tacos
in the end you should forgive them
Is this relationship advice time?
Yes
its kinda of funning lauging at my self
No fanfic
thats got to hurt
RL is srs bsns gusy

only a jailbroken 1/2nd gen can rip a SACD ISO
By having no fixed goal in mind, it cannot, under any circumstance, be said to ahve failed.
nothing else can. you can play on other things, buty ou can't rip
Failure is always an option
it needs thrust
CANNOT FAIL
00,02while(1) { fail() }
