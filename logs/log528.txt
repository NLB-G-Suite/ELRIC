+1 to that, rejection hurts
Is he reading a story?
cept it wasnt one person who didnt ruin my life it was man over many years
there are plenty more fish in the sea as they say
Rejection does hurt. :S I only experienced it once
nighty Rain
7 billion actually
don't forget, there are more women than men
Ok fine ignore me then
I can't really get this because I've never been rejected.
i say screw that 1 fish
there are so more fish in the sea ... to bad you're in the desert O.o
I experienced it... wait... 1.... 2.... maybe 3 times
Magic ew
Meanwhile: u baws
AgentKalim? :)
no you shutup
Yeah well, to be rejected you have to offer.
i have exp rejection well i have no clue how many time
i mean who cares bout that 1 fish
id say the thing that hurts more than rejection is a bad breakup
Ive been rejected 1 time
fish tacos
Like the haters that hate us for watching MLP?
no you'll be a Rio
Life is tough, but not all that bad >.>
Take out your frustrations by chopping their heads off.
in the end you should forgive them

who would dare block the triforce?

Lil_B the ivybridge stuff is NICE

TheHoodyNinja: Gannondorf.
You have been Gannon-banned
Newfoals, newfoals everywhere

Chrysalis Ivy Bridge is Tri-Gate Processor right?
also just saying IN D&D CHARISMA IS SHUNNED AS USELESS but in this case could be very usefull (theme of the show and all)
Question: Anyone know if there is going to be a movie tonight? I need to plan my evening accordingly

rio: Well, it's not D&D rules anyway. :P
hai everypony :3
TheHoodyNinja: T.T

Hello, Spell-of-Gaming
Kakumy: When someone feels like it.

Spell-of-Gaming: Sup bro /)
Meanwhile: NOO!!!!
Kakumy: YEEES. YEEES.
I'm reading My Little Dashie for the first time...
Have fun with that
but seriuosly if D&D shunned charisma i bet the RIM might shun hm maybe greed or something (not of of the 7 main skills but eh 6_9
Oh ya I need to continue reading My Little Dashie :P
I'm in the page 2.... I'm crying like a bitch
My Little Dashie is boring as snot.
Chrysalis The major reason i choose Ivy is for future upgrading and because it has less energy-loss due to heat
Oh my, do I see newcomers
So how's stuff Meanwhile? :)
MadSurge: Who cares?
Meanwhile: It's not that bad. Just kinda overrated
Meanwhile: I do!
anypony i know here?
Sooooo.. Meet the pyro on wednesday
NEW COMERS!?!?!? WHERE WHERE!?!?! :O
MadSurge: Not bad. Not great, but not bad.
smelt depends... from where coud one know you?
and final note if you do play expect not the DM to hold your hand every session (he help at first but you gotta buck down and play)
Meanwhile: Trixie does. *rim shot/Troll face&
from yesterday
/me bonks Iron_Edge with a cinderblock.
i have a secret circle of friends
Iron_Edge no i don't :p
/me hides all of Meanwhile's cinderblocks

Meanwhile: "Not bad" means good to me!
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: :D
/me Sits on Meanwhile's head
/me oh god why
Chrysalis don't foget the oil
I never asked for this.

Quite.

Iron_Edge: hey man

Dear lord my headset is making saunas out of my ears.
Nittany_Discord: Okie doki loki
A curse on this weather.
sometimes i don't know if /] would be more like a horseshoe... but nopony in MLP wears horseshoes XD
Meanwhile: Take it off, then.
Lil_B: Big Mac wears shoes
AttackWithHugs: whenever I do, steam comes out. And if I leave them off how will I hear things
Listening to smile smile while reading My Little Dashie...
Lil_B: Maybe they do. Maybe we can't see em
Meanwhile: ...are you a robot?
Lil_B: it could be like a colt's hoof
Are you a SPY?
12!pokemon
Soital, you are a 10Nidoqueen.
Lil_B: there are horseshoes in mlp. They played horseshoes during aj and rd's contest

hi Vordox :)
12well D:<
(\ Ponies47
AttackWithHugs: Silence, meat.
Hai Lil_B
I gotta lose some weight as well :s
Meanwhile: WHAT? No. Eat little meals throughout the day. Eating all at once is terrible.
I'm going to go folks. I'll be back later :).
thanks for the advice Meanwhile
Bye Everlasting_Joy :P
bye Everlasting_Joy
good luck alexxm, i was going to the gym today but it's been raining all morning ...
AgentKalim: Not 3 meals worth, just 1. Seriously, I'm terribly underweight and it's because I don't eat enough.
STREAM
Meanwhile: Meat? MEAT? I might be meat, good sir, but I am a human and pride myself in being one. *pokes you hard in the chest*
AHOY
TF2
Wait wait, on second thought. I'll stay and watch Wrek.
suddenly Wrek?

Derp capss
Wrek: :(
Wrek: Where you going?
AttackWithHugs: *chest makes a ding sound* Fair enough fleshling.
Wrek: You going somewhere?
Ponies47 I just need to get some muscles and loos my rather small gut, I don't know how, but somehow my muscle-decrease and fat-increase is perfectly anti-proportional to each other XD
Wrek how come?
Meanwhile: And I shall not succumb to such names such as 'Meat' or Fleshling. I am a human, not a piece of food.
Soldat
I just need to get rid of my calamity
Wrek: tell us y :( where u going?
-lol I love working as a blacksmith cause due to the extreme heat levels I sweat off nearly a quarter of my body everyday -lol Then eat some then sweat it off and repeat.
Who is streaming?
i think wrek
AttackWithHugs: Oh I dunno I'm sure someone'd eat you.
BroKnee: Wrek
Wrek
BroKnee: wrek
so many pings
lol
AttackWithHugs: you don't like Terminators do you? :D
Meanwhile: then I will mak sure to avoid them at all cost.
Wrek: Oh sure, you leave when I get the chance to get the game installed. . . What a world.
does anyone like the composer anymation? :3
Lil_B: Hmm strange. But yeah. I heard if you don't drink soda and just drink water that really helps. That's anthor reason why I've done a major cut back on soda.
AttackWithHugs: Guess you're either very composed or my joke flew past you. :P
Where you going Wrek?
MadSurge: I've never seen the movies.
I can tell cause the only word I can understand on the stream is Double Cross. Aside from that its all foreign to me -lol
Wrek: Y U Leave?
Wrek can ya tell us y u never gonna stream again first?
omg pings
lol
He's going on vacation folks.
AttackWithHugs: see the first and second. They're awesome. Ignore the others
ahhh
Meanwhile: The first one and I'm just realizing the joke. *dune cap*
Everlasting_Joy: OK NVM!!! HE AIN'T LEAVING US!!
/me places a dunce cap on her head
Fuck sake
Did you guys see Wrek's new animation there. O.o
So my laptop dies
AttackWithHugs: Hehehe. *Hug*
He even said "for 3 weeks."
/me hugs Meanwhile back
he is no longer a brony he is leaving us! ( just kidding )
Really need to get the bastard thing checked
Good evening everypony.
o sup Malavolent
hmm dont know if i should join Wr3k just to snipe him
Hey Malavolent :)
Ponies47 Water is good because it helps you body run properly->more efficient burning of fat, and Water doesn't have kalorines in itself, but about 2-3 Liters a day are good for you
Hey Malavolent :)
i wouldnt join him but hes playing on my fav server
darnit
Anyone has any idea why the normal chat doesn't work for me?
Good evening, Malevolent
BrOnyxia: ^
Very_Silly_Filly: your wrist? :O
No thankfully, my laptop
Lil_B: And working out of coarse. Cutting back on amount of food you eat eat food with less calories ect.
I think the fan has fucked
Malavolent: Doesnt work how?
Hi
Malavolent: happens on several pcs... maybe try firefox, google chrome , something else
AttackWithHugs: And hearing without headsets is overrated.
Iron_Edge: Well, it gets stuck in quarter of loading bar and doesn't do anything.
Very_Silly_Filly: Even if I'm an internetholic, I'd prefer to be healthy and lose my computer :D
Meanwhile: Sometimes. When I'm listening to music I stick them in my ears but when I crave the sounds of the outside world, off they go
BrOnyxia: Never had problem with my browser until today.
I'm pretty healthy as it is anyway :P
I guess I'll just try to clear cache to begin with.
AttackWithHugs: All I can hear if I take them off is next door shouting at each other. Or birds. Bit of a coin toss really.
Malavolent: Go and delete your cache from your history then refresh the chat.
Besides, without it, I'm unable to contact anyone
Malavolent: If that doesnt fix it switch browsers.
Malavolent: then it will may be fixed... did you try to refresh?
BrOnyxia: Of course :D
Meanwhile: Have you considered sitting outside your house or just walking without them on?
AttackWithHugs: ...outside...?
Malavolent: hm... then cookies maybe? dunno
Meanwhile: You know, outside. With nature.
BrOnyxia: Maybe, I'll clear them and then we'll see.
Morning all.
Hey XAX!
AttackWithHugs: ...nature...?
Allo XAX
Malavolent: alright
Hey XAX :p
:D PonyWrek smokes!
AttackWithHugs: Oh right, that. I hate it.
MadSurge: -lol I thought that was a paint brush.
hey XAX you sleep well
Howdy XAX.
Iron_Edge: well, paintbrushes don't release clouds of smoke :D
Meanwhile: Why? It's nice to go outside every now and then. Just sit on a patio or at a water fountain in a park and just listen to everything.
whos winning
AttackWithHugs: I love nature and natural parks :3 enough to make me overcome my natural lazyness and visit everything
It's tied right now alexxm.
/Charlie Sheen: WINNING"
thanks Everlasting_Joy
AttackWithHugs: I live in the English countryside and I own 5 cats, I get enough of natures guts on the rug in the morning as it is.
Nice headshot!
:O
Nice mask.
CELESTIA
Meanwhile: All the guts aside, it seems nice to live in the countrysie. Lots of space to run around and tire yourself out if your allergies don't tire you out first.
Ohman allergies that's pretty great. Don't remind me. :P
6hi
/me 6late
AttackWithHugs: not allergic to anything, but I got all the running around out of me when I was younger. :P But yeah, I'd rather live here than a city.
AttackWithHugs: Hey, just and idea, try to look inside every paper box you find.
an*
Oranges suck when you just cut your finger-nails :(
Malavolent: I've never tried it. What's it for?
Meanwhile: I can't figure out how you englishmen can live with that cold climate :|
AttackWithHugs: Oh... no particular reason... maybe.
MadSurge: It's too damn hot right now, don't give me that.
Lil_B: Ikr .__.
Meanwhile: 20 C°?
MadSurge: Har de har har.
MadSurgemy fingers! thy do nothing!
Meanwhile: I live in the capital of my state, which is mainly city but when you get away from it, just backroads and country.
Cold in England? Hah, try Scotland
^
Meanwhile: No I'm serious, what's it like there?
Meanwhile: Columbia covers a vast area of the Midlands
12hai
/me late too
Malavolent: I see hoboes at the park downtown so I don't know if I'd take my chances.
MadSurge: Too warm, not windy enough, not raining enough. Oh and it's too warm.
AttackWithHugs: I hate cities. Too grey. Too fast. Too little green.
It's gonna be over 100 in Wisconsin today :s
"The Doctor has doubled the fun." Oh that's good.
Meanwhile: we're on the constant verge of 35-40 C° and when there's no wind it's hell :S
Though frankly the weather in England is never right.
Lawl
If there's one thing the English can do it's complain about the weather.
^
>Tell us that we're in a drought
Meanwhile: My friend who lives about 10 minutes from me lives off of a high-traffic road but the neighborhood is nice. Houses and beautiful lawns. Quiet area. The road he lives on is across from a Blue Cross Blue Shield Building
Meanwhile: Come to Minnesota.
>rains a fuckton and there's flooding all over the place
well at least the weather was somewhat summerish in england today
back in my day, i had to walk uphill through a blizzard to go complain about the weather. now you have chat and instant messaging
AttackWithHugs: Sounds kinda like where I live.
Fields. And cows. And sheep.
11,01Aww. Luna killed Wrek.
well goodnight everypony i am going to bed
hi
Hi guys.
bye RainBowJack
Goodnight, RainBowJack
Night night RainBowJack.
Later RainBowJack
hey icybeauti hows your day been
Hi, Dark_Horst and icybeauti
Meanwhile: In a metropolitan place, there are houses and nice yards. Just gotta go look for them through all the Interstates
Hey alexxm It's been good except for the rain
hey Dark_Horst hows your day been
Meanwhile: Also, it gets hot during the summer in the southeastern united states. This week is supposed to be high 90 degrees Farenheit
why do so many people dislike me?
AttackWithHugs: Yeah, around here more of the land mass is field.
XD Rain
We <3 you really
Rain: No appreciation apparently, but I love ya.
<3
Rain: Just because I don't speak to you doesn't mean I hate you.
icybeauti: Not really. Most of Columbia is Interstate, downtown, and apartments.
AttackWithHugs: Columbia? Oh wow, you live a lon way from me.
alexxm: stressfull. i'll spare you long explanations. just let it be known that our professor for data banks isnt so popular at the moment
Everlasting_Joy: It was a joke because we were talking about the weather. :P
rain is func_precipitation with preciptype 1
Rain is beautiful :D
Hell if I look out the back I can see a corn field.
MadSurge: it's wet
gah, it takes 2 hours till i can get to eat:[
Hell I've stolen corn from it.
sorry to hear about that Dark_Horst
Which rain? Rain or weather rain?
Dark_Horst: and quenchy
/me is digging the music.
Lawl, nah
It's reaining here right now. Get your butt to NY if you want some rain!
Meanwhile: I would prefer to live someplace in the middle. I live in what is bascially the city limits
AttackWithHugs: Where I live would be perfect for you.
AttackWithHugs: You can't climb haybales in the middle. :P
Wrek, where you going?
ok so I just caught the last third of Kung Fu Panda 2 :D
13rain rain~<3
God I love haybales.
baby po was aweseom
Meanwhile: I'd be scared to climb a haybale. I've never even climbed a tree.
/me hugs Shizuka
Shizuka <3
13<3
>never climbed a tree
I wouldn't want to sing go away, that would be rude :P
But...
AttackWithHugs: you've never climbed a tree? -_^
Childhood?
/me 13loves rain~<#
^
Rain <3a3
@dari
*<3
Meanwhile: Assuming that's sarcastic, I hear ya.
Everlasting_Joy: What?
season 3 is not coming so fast
Really? I lvied in brooklyn till age 2, then moved to the burbs and climbed.
/me loves Shizuka~<3
thomas i think it'll air september
AttackWithHugs: Oh yeah. Where I live have pretty bad taxes, but it is a convient location.
after vacantion i don't have time then
Meanwhile: Weren't you talking about haybales?
2Kung Fu Panda <3
Meanwhile: Nope. Too afraid of falling and breaking something. I can't climb the magnolia tree in my parent's yard and my niece could probably climb it and she's FOUR.
Everlasting_Joy: Yeah, I used to climb them when the farm stacked them up in summer.
6you've
6never seen that movie
I'm not that far from a city, I didn't grow up near haybales...
6correct?
AttackWithHugs: Pfft, cityfolk...
There's something quite nice about this delivery gig - I don't have to suffer under the summer heat as much - triple degree temps all week
Meanwhile: Oh that's fun! I have stocked them though, that's not fun.
AttackWithHugs: Well, I live in an upper middle class area, so it's kinda like that.
not the second yet D:
but then again, I'd rather be working as a park ranger or something like that
6why'd you watch the last bit then OTL
and yeah I caught then end but there was nothing better on tv
6yuo should really watch it
6it's a really good movie
Meanwhile: I wouldn't call myself a city-slicker or a country girl. I've never worked on a farm and I wasn't born in a city. I was born in an Army hospital ^^ In Hawaii
I don't think I could handle a rural area. I'm too city oriented to go to one...
what class is celestia supposed to be
Thinking about it the amount of dumb stuff I did as a kid, it's a wonder I'm actually alive.
yeah I loved the switch to 2d animation in the rememberance scene
Meanwhile: The same can be said of everyone.
icybeauti: Mainly white, I'm guessing? (no offense)
what sort of stuff did you do Meanwhile
I'm still in the middle of childhood, but being the youngest and overpotected, I don't screw around much
Meanwhile: those are the stories you tell you're grandkids :)
AttackWithHugs: Eyup
and yeah I'll keep an eye out for it on sky
There's this farm we used to go to when I was younger which had a massive stack of hay Meanwhile
I have a feeling this looks better than the first
andbrb
2Shen was a really great villain
The number of times I could have been crushed by haybales or hit by tractors or shot by a farmer or drowned in a canal or hit by a barge or fallen out a tree and snapped my neck or been gored by bulls or whatever.
And you could crawl in gaps and tunnels that went through it
The rage train!
It was awesome
icybeauti: Ah. Definitely expensive. But then again I'm more white than black so I get called an Oreo sometimes
RAGE TRAIN
Damn straight dari.
Meanwhile: survival of the fittest right there!
Finally fixed the chat.
Malavolent what was wrong with it
AttackWithHugs: There are literally 5 black kids in my grade.
6it's a really well done sequel
Meanwhile: I was constantly ill as a kid and I bonked my head around quite a lot :D I'm lucky to be alive too
SUP ERRYPONY
6and shen was a spectacular villain
that fluttershy was creepy
alexxm: The new version of Flash player was acting up, had to uninstall it, clean registries and install it again.
icybeauti: Dang. they're not the ghetto type, are they? I can't stand that ghetto stuf.
hey IMissOsamaBrony hows your day been
AttackWithHugs: I'm actually 15 minutes from the bronx.
6plus gary oldman brought that character to life
There was this one time when a friend of mine threw a water bomb at a car and the loony in it chased us up the road.
2Omg absolutely
quite well alexxm
Lawl
alexxm: those models are really creepy, yeah
ah right Malavolent any reason why it was acting up
hey alexxm you wanna join my clan?
Nothing extreme happens where I live...
icybeauti: I've never been to NY before so I don't know what it's like living there :D
MadSurge ponies should not move like that
alexxm: I dunno, ask Adobe. I just installed it today.
You know, the friend who isn't quite as savvy as the rest. -_^
IMissOsamaBrony what clan
Derpy hooves killed himself.
Lulz.
alexxm: and not have a dead face like that
alexxm ScrubClan
AttackWithHugs: You get all the seasons and the city is gorgeous. It's a really nice place, but I just hate my town.
Celestia!
I feel like crying OH COME ON CELESTIA IN THE GAME...
MadSurge Molestia...
icybeauti: I guess every place is gorgeous in a way...except the REALLY bad ones.
IMissOsamaBrony what game is it in
AttackWithHugs: Yeah. there are some crappy places in the city, but since 9/11, it's gotten better,
Dat1FuglyMuffin: Molestia isn't canon :D
alexxm its cod4, mw2,blops, AVA, tf2, bf3
MadSurge model is after Molestia though...
icybeauti: That's good. How so, if I may ask?
back
alexxm its also in ipod games
IMissOsamaBrony sorry i don't have any of those games
adn gary oldman is there a film where he's /not/ the villain? xD
Dat1FuglyMuffin: those models are so creepy :D
05fyi: fluttershy's uber is a kritskrieg and unber in one
AttackWithHugs: The security has stepped up, so crime decreased a lot. It's actaully one of the safest big cities.
alexxm alright thats cool
6harry potter
ANYPONY ELSE WANNA JOIN?
2And wasn't he in Batman?
6granted he was kinda the villain for movie 3
6mistake villain
IMissOsamaBrony: In what?
icybeauti: Cool. Is that stereotype about New Yorkers true or not? I have a couple of friends from New York and they don't brag about it on a constant basis but they do have that "accent"
Fluttershy's medigun is hax.
Everlasting_Joy
ScrubClan
I'll pass.
alright
AttackWithHugs: The accent only happens if you're close to the city or are in it. If you go upstate, everyone sounds more normal.
actually yeah he was
12o.o
10o.o
o-o
03sweet, I have a job lined up
but in the new film he'll probably go 'oh I just realised I'm Gary Oldman, I WILL KILL BATMAN wahahahaaa!"
NO NOT Batman~!
I think I'd settle for upstate. I have a friend from Maine and he definitely has the accent because you can hear it when he says "March"
Wait! Was that a Marrowack?
anyone know what server this is?
03also yay
10So drf, how about that last episode?
/me holds up Angel Beats complete collection Blu-Ray
*anypony
icybeauti: It sounds like "Mah-ch"
03it was... weird to say teh least
03*the
I'm still here don't worry. Just doing other stuff. :P
AttackWithHugs: My dad actually says march like that lol
03it's like "LOL forget everything we told you, now we're going to completely mindf*** the entire series"
Aww dat guitar.
03actually AB did that too, what is it with short anime series and having odd plot U-turns
icybeauti: He's from the upstate too or the Northeast US?
YES
what server is this ?
AttackWithHugs: He was in teh city until around 6 ish, but he lived in a county closeby to the city, so he got the accent.
10Willing to stick around for the Puella movie?
03when will that be?
03and better question, how long will it take them to dub it
/me runs
10Fall 2012 in Japan
asfhasgihoasghoihoipsiopgashioghoig
icybeauti: Makes sense. I was born on Oahu, Hawaii but I was raised in Georgetown, SC
Dance Wrek dance!
Bye bye everyponY!!!!

hello everypony
10Third installment will be a continuation of the story
Btw, i need that tf2 mod!! ;)
03that reminds me of the Code Geass movies
/me hugs Meanwhile and AttackWithHugs ;)
03apparently both of them are just recaps of the anime :/
How do i get mods and but them in the game?
03and all the actual addon stuff isn't dubbed
HIYA everypony
now i join tf2
2Dubs :<
10How old is it?
03hey, I like my stuff in English, gtfo
03um
03like 2006?
10There's still a chance the addon could be dubbed?
03np
Who's livestreaming?
10Or not
03*no
03heck
03Code Geass was like
Wrek is MasterBoss43
Wrek be streaming
03it was released by Bandai, right
AttackWithHugs: They sound pretty cool though. MadSurge There a bunch of different types, but my mom says there are spanish accents, but since that isn't my native language, they al sound the same to me.
03Bandai was lik e"LOL guys we're just going to stop making DVDs now kthx"
So... Wrek is Swedish like me then?
Metal and Twilight. That'd be Wrek.
03so it's essentially out of print >_>
hiii
03also they were like "Hey, we know the anime was made in high def but let's just not release Blu-Rays"
03so... yeah
His teamfortress is in Swedish....
Wrek: your oc is awesome in sprite form
icybeauti: Virtually every language has accents
So he gotta be Swedish.
MasterBoss43: He is.
Hi there, mikebond3401
Ohai Bronysith. Have fun :P
03I wasn't really whining, more just pointing it out o.o
10w/e
03since bluesun told me most of that stuff isn't really worth watching anyway
Except maybe inuit.
03he's the one who suggested Geass
Jamen vad trevligt då! (Well how nice then in Swedish). :D
hey sith
03which is a pretty interesting show
:)
10Watch TTGL next
dat dancing Rarity
03what's that
10It's completely dubbed
10Tengan Toppa Gurren Lagann
03why did I read that as Green Lantern
03o_O
That rarity is a spy.
Hello all :)
10You must need new glasses
03and uh
icybeauti: Well some spanish cities tend to talk faster and skip some letters :D
Howdy Irish_Pony.
03jun told me to watch uh
03that
Pinkie'd.
02did someone call me?
pinkie pie's violent
Hi Irish_Pony
03no.
10lolSuzumiya
02or was drf talking about Blue-Ray
03of course I was
10That show is full of fanservice
03fanservice?
Ohai Irish_Pony :P
Mlp fim. 1 of the best things to happen to the world
hai masterbawss
Hi MasterBoss43! Sorry didn't see you there :)
Like a bauws!
10Quoting UD because I CBA
hi Ponies47
I'll never understand why the rest of the world thinks the English accent is the one used by people in top hats and monocles.
MasterBoss43: Hi! :D
11,01This game type is familiar.
10In terms of anime, the least extreme form of nudity or sexually based angles. This may include panty shots, minor nudity, underwear shots, bouncing breasts and other such things added solely for comic effect or pleasuring perverted fans.
Ohai LochNessCheez :P
Meanwhile: lolwut?
Nittany_Discord: Cartoony Violence?
icybeauti: You know what accent everyone loves? A russian one.
03LOL
BRB
10With the case of Suzumiya: bunny costumes, big breasts, and uh
Nittany_Discord: awesome game type?
/me hugs everypony
XD I actually come online like just now, because i had my cp on sleep mode while i was sleeping.
03don't almost all animes have BBW's? :P
/me glomps Meanwhile
hi mod! Dont worry i wont spam smileys hehe :[
03Madoka did that too
Malavolent: Those sound really cool. I love european accents a lot, especially british.
03I mean, relative to their ages
10Not all
10But many
03I said almost all
Meanwhile: Because ignorance?
love and tolerate UNTIL YOU DIE
icybeauti: British is... fancy. The eastern european languages have cool accents too.
03Angel Beats is one exception I've seen so far
>fancy
10TTGL has it too
03that show was really awesome, LOL
03TTGL has which
03an exception or the reverse?
Clearly you've not heard many English people speak
10BBW
03ah
03it's not like I exactly mind :P
12no
Malavolent: The german ones sound cool, and it's cool how they pronounce the a's
12not haruhi
Not really.
03but I'm also not setting out to watch series just because of that xD
I live in england
i wish when i got mad. My voice would become john de lancies
10Don't lie, we know you do
03I just don't like overly violent anime
/me flees
03I'm more squeamish than anything
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZRyNa57YeA Tobuscus funny vid!
03sexual stuff is fine, but blood and gore, no thanks
'ERE LUV SHOW US YA' BOOOOBS.
03call me weird, IDK
^English
mikebond3401: bad move
10I haven't encountered too many violent anime
10well
Because damn, I would never describe Scouser or Mancunian accents as 'fancy'
?
03a lot of anime is overly violent
10If bloody scenes count
03it's not so much the violence but the result of it
Back :P
03you know, bloodsplattering everywhere?
icybeauti: Well I pronounce them the same way, so they seem normal to me.
03completely unrealistic LOL
12watch higurashi
10Wolf's Rain, GNG/GDW, Bleach (I think
/me RUNS
10?)*
not everyone speaks like the usual stereotypical fancy gentlemanly british voice
03Bleach was so-so
03I need to watch that show
03but the dub's like two years behind
Mhmm, in fact most of us speak like chavs.
13Higurashi :D
10Bleach is too long
I'm in tears :(
13also Elfen Lied
13;3
LochNessCheez: Not everyone? Virtually no one more like
03I only saw about 30 episodes
03it is
12LOL
pretty much
03who's elfen and why did he lie
/me rujns
03-j
10I dropped Naruto for that reason
what happened Kakumy
12Yeah you'll like Higurashi and Elfen Lied ;3
at least here in northumbria
Kakumy: Why? :(
icybeauti: I love british accents, but all accents are nice :3 German sounds very tough with a mellow tongue like italian
03oh god Naruto
I read My Little Dashie
03I dropped Naruto because it suffered from DBZ syndrome
Be right back.....
/me hugs Kakumy
/me Hugs Kakumy
/me hugs Kakumy
03>stand around talking about how you're going to kill someone for 3 episodes
12it suffers from a lot
Kakumy: I cried to :(
03I only saw about 12 episodes of Naruto, that was enough for me :P
Lawl
HIYA everypony
Man the fuck up
hey
13I have a friend who used to be obsessed with Naruto
:>
Kakumy: I know the fell brah -hugs-
icybeauti: :D
03<Soital> not haruhi <- are you telling me not to watch that series or ?
hey Bronysith hows your day been
13and made me sit through 5 episodes and a movie with them
icybeauti: Heeeeey. I'm from the Midwest :|
13.w.
03LOL
Kakumy: in the words of kamina. "LETS SEE YOU GRIT THOSE TEETH!" punch
Ha thx guys :P
12Well if you like big breasted woman go watch it
03I willingly watched it, gave up after like 12
03LOL
IKR Meanwhile. :D
12actually
Ponies47: You probably think the Ny accetns are weitd too
03again, it's not like I dislike them :P
Never change dari.
12High scho- oh wait thats fanservice with gore
03it's just funny how most anime has it
03what, high school of the dead?
/me likes this song ALOT.
12yeah
03that was a recommendation to Angel Beats
03not sure why
12LOL
icybeauti: Nope.avi. I don't mind :P
03well, other than the fact that Angel Beats is *literally* a high school of the dead
03:P
wow wreks oc pony is smoking
thats kewl
lol
The thunder is creeping me out
10It looks like Highschool of the Dead's dub is finished
You know, for kids.
12Fan service zombie end of the world scenario
[21:44] <Bronysith> wow wreks oc pony is smoking THIS IS HOW CANCER HAPPENS
you know...i wasnt aware that aerobic exercise required you to stomp around like the incredible hulk
At the part where Dashie left the house cause she found out she was in a show I tear a bit
ponies get cancer?
12fun to read
10oh
Disclaimer: Smoking isn't cool.
10Wow
Kakumy: -hugs again-
but the part where she was leaving...damn too much...
I meant when you said it was cool
:P
10I didn't even notice you guys talking about HOTD until I came back to IRC
Ingwaz: Now you know. :P And knowing is half the battle. G I JOOOOE
10Was checking for complete HOTD dub
12XD
03I think it exists
I would love to see a DesktopPony of my OC :)
^
03AMazon sells the Blu-Ray
So many heavies, one is bound to have a sandvich :P
That was to Malavolent.
Dolan is cancer.
^
MadSurge: There's the normal sounding, the midwest, the west, the northeast...Tons....
Inb4 Meanwhile pls.
Malavolent: -.-
Dolan IS cancer.
Allow me to play double's advocate.
12Watch Durarara
03you know another anime I liked that nobody ever talks about? Sailor Moon
/me runs
For all intensive purposes I think you are wrong
10Ohgod
13I second what Soital said
13;3
I need to hear Smile smile now...
03how long is that show
12Whoa haven't watched Sailor Moon in a long time
btw bronies are meant to love ant tolerate
12I use to love it
03and I know people on hoshinet call it Durararararararara so
12LONG
10Sailor Moon is just no
12LOL
/me runs
11,01Fluttershy is up.
Kakumy: Get your butt on youtube then
In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies.
^
03<Skylands> Sailor Moon is just no <- why? :P
icybeauti: rofl
10I prefer TMM over it but even then
LochNessCheez: eeyup :)
03I mean yeah it's cheesy
Derpy if you think im a pineapple!
03but it's magical girls
lol
03that just goes with the definition
03Madoka is cheesy too
03XD
Love and tolerate is silly rubbish for the naive.
icybeauti: much like there's quite a few italian accents, one for each region :D
Malavolent, that joke just flew straaaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiight over your head
*WHOOSH*
13I didn't watch Sailor Moon, I was more interested in Cardcaptors :P
And it's outta here.
XD
/me hugs Meanwhile
oh, the misspellings were intentional
MadSurge: Really? Yeah, it's the same case; I don't know much about italian accents.
/me hugs AttackWithHugs back.
12Madoka's character reminded me of Harry Potters character in the way where that character was created to blossom everyone else's personality and actions
13I have a friend who's into Cardcaptors, I gave him my DVD of both of the movies for his birthday cuz I didn't want it anymore
03wait
03you have Cardcaptors DVCDs?
03*DVDs
03They're rare as frick, apparently
/me Attacks AttackWithHugs with hugs :)
03what I've been told: good series, but horrible dub treatment and the releases are rare
12ff yeah Cardcaptors
6_9
12I loved that show too
:[
031/3 of the show
03>_>
03Australia on the other hand
13Oh, it's supposed to be rare?
03got the entire series
icybeauti: the stereotypical accent is the naples one, but cities like Bologna and Milan have different ones
03but was never released
/me gets hugged by Ponies47
03so I need to go find people who recorded it off TV xD
03Yes
03rare enough to the point we don't even have all of it
Irish_Pony: You don't know what you're missing. :D
03"Cardcaptors: The Movie" is common, if that's what you had
MadSurge: I went to naples on my trip to italy. Ther pizze kicked so much ass there.
13I got a DVD with both the movies on it like 6 years ago or something
03but the actual episode discs
*hugs attackwithugs and ponies 47*
03are really rare
13Oh, nope I watched the episodes online xD
12hai Danny
03hi
03LL
:)
12?
03guess where I got a job offer at
/me hugs mikebond3401 AttackWithHugs and Ponies47
03and well
I can never look at Rainbow Dash the same way again...
10o.o
10So
GilDash: Well Im gonna be neglected anyways :P
:)
03it's more than an offer, I'll be starting there in 2 weeks unless I decide not to LOL
icybeauti: if we know something is how to make kickass food. :)
12nice :3
/me Hugs LochNessCheez back :)
10I ordered this Wendy's Pokémon toy on Amazon
13I only watched a couple of the dub episodes on TV when I was younger
10The picture listed the Lugia compass
03Skylands I ate at McDonald's earlier and they still have BW toys
12CITV!

12CITV was damn epic
Best. Brony. Chatsite. ever
10and instead I get this Charizard card holder thing
icybeauti: did you enjoy your trip there?
10MISLEADING
10>_>
12Sailor Moon, Cardcaptors, Pokemon ;3
I skipped breakfest and lunch today. I have ate nothing :P
^

MadSurge: I loved it. I want to go back one day.
12Digimon
12fff <3
*hugs LochNessCHeez*
Bye LochNessCheez
12o.o
mikebond3401: It's the lesser evil, I'd say.
12Complain to them
03I'd watch Cardcaptors if I could find a complete dub
03btw guys
13I used to watch Cardcaptors, Pokemon, Digimon and Hamtaro ;3
03the Japanese series is called Cardcaptor Sakura, get it right
12Hamtaro!
12YES
12<3
03"Cardcaptors" is exclusively the dub name
03:P
WreK: Where you going? D:
13I know, it's just that Cardcaptors is easier to type
13less effort too
13:D
12^
03CCS?
03that's what I see it called
12CBA.
03that's only 3 letters
03:P
Mmm Limon lays OMNOMNOMNOMNMONMONMOM!!!!!!

otakon: I read...My Little Dashie...god I teared...

Hey otakon :p
03if I were bothered enough I'd do hybrid DoR/dub DVD releases XD
03but I haven't seen the series
Kakumy: you pansy :P
you can dor it, but there will be compromizes. cut the dub, extend the dub, hybrid etc
hiya Ponies47
otakon: O_O
03BD ISO
otakon: Who? 6_9
03-ed
japanese ISO onry
icybeauti: near my house there's salt pods that are used since before the roman empire, and it's a natural reserve with lots of pretty birds <3
03mfw aniplex
03but only like $35
i bought the dub ISO
Hi DRF and Jun
Kakumy: that's nothing, read Fallout Equestria without getting teary eyed... not possible
cooool!
03Madoka is stupidly overpriced aniplex

03HML I got you a $10 MicroSD
hey, has Val been in lately?"
icybeauti: flamingoes too have been sighted there <3
here is a DA of ep1 that i made
0316GB, class 4
Cba to read Fallout Equestria. Never really liked Fallout.
Kakumy: Read Rainbow factory. Instant fix.
Wrek's sword swinging was in beat with the strong beat. It was awesome.
otakon: Not lately today.
sounds like a good place to live MadSurge
Send me
Hey how do u share video ????
lived*
i extended the dub and cut the jap
Kakumy: ITS A TRAP!
Oh my Rainbow Factory
Damn, I really should get some sleep.
Kakumy: do NOT read Rainbow Factory
I know no shit...
:P
Malavolent: What time is it? :P
For sure RD gets killed...
03you mean cut the raw?
03I never said dual audio, I said DoR LOL
*cut the jap (video)
03kinda like what I did with Pokémon episode 18
Ponies47: 11 pm.
AND I'm near the sea. Like, 5 minutes on a bike close.
03just hybrid-source
it that
Kakumy: Haha, silly you, she will win!
10well, at least I got M11
lol looked like rarity was headbobbing
THAT WAS A GIANT RARITY!
10Now to wait for Mewtwo Returns
Malavolent: You don't even wanna know how late I stay up :P
problem is thereare 3-8 cuts per ep maybe?
the hell?
sometimes up to 20
03so what
03it takes effort, but it only needs to be done once
Ponies47: You're right, I don't :P
its >effort
how late?
03Skylands I could have sent you my movie 11
03I hate the new movies
CELESTIA!?
03:|
I really have to read that. The RD presents mess up the stories too much
RARITY
THE HELL IS GOING ON!?
otakon: Say hello to the MLP heroes server.
4:00 AM or later :$
otakon: mod
10pfft
OMG!
owloysius: I figured as much
XD
Which is sadder My Little Dashie or Fallout Equestria?
GOTCHA
Kakumy Dashie
Did ur eyes fall out???
10Anyways, I'm thinking about registering for Amazon and contacting that seller
MLD is a nice idea, but it could be better written.
My Little Dashie is just dull.
10since I don't have access to my dad's
Kakumy: MLD is shorter by far, Fallout Equestria is better over all IMO.
Mmm
03that would seem a bit odd to the seller
10It really pisses me off
10?
Kakumy: Never reed Fallout Equestria. I have listened to a reading of My Little Dashie. The guy who was reading it started crying :(
UMMM How do u share video?????????
mikebond3401: You need streaming software.
03someone else emailing about a purchase made on another account
oh
But by sadness is it Fallout Equestria or MLD
Haha that would
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5342/ <- I need this sign :P
mikebond3401: And even so, you can't share it on here.
10Well
I havent' read a lot of fanfics. I read the vagabond and mylittle avengers. Then of course, I read cupcakes and MLD
10I'm gonna ask them what other toys they have
wut about that <--
10http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004QF2760/
Ponies47: But I'm not just watching them.

alexxm: Go on the EQD and look it up. It was a very good fic.
How long is Fallout Equestria...

03and crap like that :P

10since >PA
08,01i came home and no-one was in
08,01so i had to break into my own house
Hi everypony
10I guess I should just ask them if they have the toy listed on the Amazon picture?
MadSurge: So true
alexxm Is MITB coming up? I guess some matches can be made tonight.......like ADR Vs Sheamus.......Kane Vs CM Punk........or Y2J becoming RAW's Mr. Money In The Bank
03this is why eBay is better since they usually have actual photos per listing xD
10Instead of bringing up the fact I bought the wrong one from them, assuming it's the same seller
Ye old breaking into ones house so many times have I had to do that.
Fluttershy!!! :( <3
Good taste in music
08,01got a large graze on my hand from reaching in through the letterbox with a length of wire to actuate the lever on the door lock
Good, alexxm

08,01but yeah, such is life
Hi MadSurge!
08,01i don't know why my parents don't want me having a set of keys, but it makes for situations like this
Hey everypony! Are we starting another trilogy tonight?

03Gwen Stefani was the original Lady Gaga, didn't you know?
Everlasting_Joy: Intresting. Like I said a few know but not all. :P
03I'm not even making that up, lots of people have said it
10Madonna
03OK fine
22:42 on one of my clocks 06:42 on another and 17:42 on the last
10Madonna, Stefani, Gaga
everyone with an account get on this server 213.112.193.21:25565 it wil be fun! theres also some non bronies here so annoy the hell out of them!
03but both Gwen Stefani and Lady Gaga, I believe, have said Madonna was one of their influences
03:P

EggWhite why do you have so many clocks
10I can confirm Lady Gaga has
03yeah
03I used to be a huge No Doubt fan

Do share!
03I was never really a fan of her
08,01well
http://derpy.me/k9np0
theSHHAS: Computer is so slow. It would take forever :(
08,01i'll start earlier than that
Ponies47: You just have to understand, no one visits my profile. The funny part about posting those pics was, I knew this was going to happen. I wanted to be proven wrong, so darn wrong, but as I've found out long before that, it sucks to be right.
03other than Genie In a Bottle, which annoyed the crap out of me back when it came out but is now an awesome song :P
10lolwat
03well
10My dad used to overplay that song in the car
08,01i was going through my gate this morning, and there were these strange web-like balls on my mesh fence
03I didn't used to like that type of music
03same with like, Britney Spears
Umm did the my chat crash?
03but yeah
03anyway
03bbl :P
08,01i didn't have time to investigate, but made a note to do so when i got home

Everlasting_Joy: Dawww :<
Ponies47: I'm use to it.

08,01so i came home and lo and behold, the strange balls have gone
One for England one for Japan as i need to see when games are coming out and one for EST because most of the places I hang about online use it.
08,01replaced by loads of tiny webs and about 50 - 100 black and yellow spiderlings!
08,01so cute!
"cider" That does not bode well.
Buck it I'm gonna try and join
And I like clocks!

Ok now lets see id I can get in there :)
08,01so they'd all fall and swing then climb back up!
Kandarihu: ya true that cause it's hotel wifi..
08,01so adorable!

Meh. I give up. :(
do u use moids and no
AgentKalim: Easy. You enjoy the game ^_^
/me hugs Ponies47 what happened
Chrysalis: I just finished building my new rig, did a quick test run, went perfectly smooth. Realized I missed installing a fancy wi-fi part to the motherboard, so I did, also connected the dvd drive. Tried booting and it short circuit, tried it again with only motherboard/gfx card connected, still short circuit
Oh, I guess that makes sense. :P
AgentKalim: Then lose track of time
TExt wall
Fair enough.
how do i use server with beta 1.2.5

The great text wall of china
PROTOSS DROIDS

Well, now you've fallen and can't get back up. :P
Protoss before Protoss :P
I don't think I'd be good at this game. Requires reflexes ^_^
yo sith
so no death by falling
Proto-ss
AgentKalim: lol
Or Proto-protoss
CCCP: You should help instead of mocking, I'm in great despair right now :'(
and then the elevator never returned
the end
FairysHuff: It requires...GASP GAME SKILLS
True. :P
Shimmer: oh sorry i didn't read it :(
Blowing up xenomorphs with bazookas: The game
That is a horrible noise.
Vordox: game skills? what skills? barely any games today require that
LOL
/me hugs Shimmer "Ill read it now"
Brute forcing XD
hey bronysith!
Bronysith: Indeed.
alexxm: I was trying to join TF2 but it couldn't find the server :(
So much ammo....
i can see that noise getting annoying
One more hit..
Vordox: I play more strategy and rpg for fun. I don't play fast games anymore. i like to relax
Ponies47 i think it might be over
mikebond3401: you got to include the capital letters in order for it to ping somepony
FairysHuff: Then that's your forté.
Mines...
XD
alexxm: Yeah think so to. :(
BRONYSITH

alexxm: Meh maybe next time I'll try to join Phase4
byy mooppyyy!
bye xxMoopyxx
Later
LOL
I am back now.
LIKE A BAWSS!
By the way, I really like how the basic gun works in this game: Shoots faster when you have ammo, but works even if you don't. Couldn't the guns in Mass Effect work like THIS? Unlimited ammo guns limited by heatsinks is retarded. :P Just sayin.
*Moopy has left the chat*
As stated..:Old Nintendo Hard
LOL
Bye xxMoopyxx :)
ded
Dem mines.
Poor Wrek XD
ouch
I Love these old loading times <3w
Mines, mines everywhere
It's a veritable minefield alright.
AgentKalim: They were unlimited in the first game anyway. :D
wat game is this?
how do u ping someone again???
I meant in Mass Effect 2
Ponies47, ?
mikebond3401: type their name exactly as it is. caps included if they have caps
Bronysith: Abuse
what does the circle star dp
Bronysith
mikebond3401: Type their username EXACTLY as it appears, caps included.
mikebond3401, you can allso type part of a name and press tab
it completes the name for you, including caps
Bronysith: Do you use mods and no I don't have a server.
Phase4: I was talking to alexxm. I was saying to him I'm gonna try and join in the next time you play TF2. I managed to get the game started up it worked ok.
BRUTE EM
And now for the famous cave

Troll map
Is it me or is this game really noisy.
AgentKalim: or dog bones
Allo HatchetRyda.
:O
Hello, HatchetRyda
Meanwhile: it's really noisy
otakon: thought so.
Wrek is paranoid now XD
lol
and he was RIGHT to be
otakon: Well that makes no sense, so that's probably not it. :P I always thought they were pipe-shaped grenades.
what game is Wrek playin?
OH GOD

Vordox: no, it requires BEING GOD
otakon: GAME SKILL = GOD
Vordox: or the patience of God
well i think ima go for alil i may be back later
Hello everypony :) Oh i see Abuse is being played xDDD

AttackWithHugs: GUESS
Vordox: dude, I don't care if you have the reflexes of a cat and the speed of mongoose this is goddamn Abuse on all concepts of the term.
AttackWithHugs: this game abuses the number of enemies
otakon: Andd I love it <3
I've been playing so much X-COM that I'm in the mood for a sci-fi alien invasion movie. Anypony know of any? And NOT independance day.
otakon: It's one of the best staples of Hard core games
Is there going to be another trilogy shown this week?
it abuses explosions
Dang. Thats seems like cheating in a way, or some kind of mod.
FairysHuff: Aliens vs Predator? lolololololololol
FairysHuff: MARS ATTACK
no
now, if only some of the mods would do a lets play on X-Com: Terror from the Deep on superhuman level, my life would be complete :D
it's too silly
otakon: is sily
silly*
Spam grenades and still die: The Game
CCCP: enope
otakon is a silly filly.
oh God
otakon: oh
This game has the difficulty of Dark Souls
well at least I'm not french
Alchemist: I'm up for it. But I'm not a mod.
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: ....Dark Soul isn't even close...
This game surpasses the difficulty of Dark Souls
This has to be HAX in some way. Has to be....
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: dude, this is WORSE than Dark SOuls on EVERY LEVEL

otakon: worse than Blighttown?
Yes
AttackWithHugs: besides the limited ammo, splash damage and the goddamn SWARMS OF ENEMIES FROM EVERY DIRECTION?
Alien vs Pred movies were terrible... which made me very sad. ~_~ I love the PC games.
HE DID IT

FairysHuff: would you save a lot? :D
FairysHuff: ^
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: yes, but not the swamp from Demon's Soul's
Screw it and run: The game
Go back to finish the corridor. As you do.

Hi AttackWithHugs
hiya AttackWithHugs
Mars Attacks doesnt have the grittinness I'm looking for.
FairysHuff: Give me a second
FairysHuff: The Day the Earth Stood Still, THE ORIGINAL
Alchemist: No. I'd save once after every mission
FairysHuff: Hell, the newer War of the Worlds is pretty grim
otakon: It just seems...damn. I've never seen a game like this before.
Well, his character's mission IS to kill them all
FairysHuff: I would definitely watch that.
otakon: also, hi *hugs*
GOTTA KILL'EM ALL! XENOMORPHS!
HatchetRyda: *pokes*
Alchemist: Now you just have to convince a mod ^_^
I would love X-Com
if I could JUST GET THE CONTROLS!
FairysHuff: I think Necroscope did one LP, but that guy abuses the save system a LOT :D
otakon: I vaguely remember that. I'll have to look it up again though
LOL
they resorted to calling Rice balls 'ice cream' now xD
AttackWithHugs: *eep*
*is watching the DP anime atm*
Alchemist: You can watch a LPer called Kikoskia play X-Com
:P
Alchemist: I watch him alot
HatchetRyda: How was your TF2 run?

SAAAVW
Kikoskia is a pretty cool guy

Instant death: The game
Yeh he's really good
Forgot to save again... :P
FairysHuff: I thought he only did the first xcom and not tftd.
Oh there we go!
ALIEN KICKARSE TIME!
AttackWithHugs: Twas fun and then turned into a big melee fight so even more fun lol
Alchemist: I don't know I haven't searched all the playlists

Hey everypony! I know I asked earlier, but are we starting a trilogy tonight?
HatchetRyda: Melee? On 2Fort?
OH CRAP

HE DID IT!
AgentKalim: That name rings a bell... did he do a Lands of Lore and a Doom 3 let's play?
Dafuq xD
Alchemist: But he did two LPs of the first X-Com yes
AttackWithHugs: eeyup
might be for the best, I don't have anything good or even plesant to say about the DP TV show
or the AG one
man those general death sounds :)
troll elevator
HatchetRyda: how'd that go and who'd you play as?
nice trick
For those interested just search "kikoskia" on youtube. He does lots of different LPs of older games
Oh Hell Level!
Suddenly Crysis 2 level
GilDash: Indeed he did.
Dat elevator glitch
Hell is this, red blood cells?
Hi everypony

Meanwhile: I wouldn't eat those blueberries....
Hi everypony.
OH COME ON

Howdy ZappyTheUnicorn.
Hi ZappyTheUnicorn
hiya ZappyTheUnicorn
The blue ones seems rather good at surviving splash
AttackWithHugs: Oh Idk, cook them right and they're probably delicious. Just like people.
I bet certain ones are weak to certain weapons
hey ZappyTheUnicorn
Hi otakon, Kriel_Pony, and Everlasting_Joy. What are we watching today?
Meanwhile: people are not delicous
Xenomorphs have flavours now.
Hi MahBoi777.
otakon: Have you ever tried one?
Meanwhile: Delicious and POISONOUS.
ZappyTheUnicorn: Abuse or Where you Die Repeatedly: The Game
AttackWithHugs: i know, i miss the fun we would have shotting each other and Darkrider lol
AttackWithHugs: Acidic, I think
AttackWithHugs: Meh. Fugu is poisonous and people still eat that.
Left
otakon: Oh, sounds like fun...
Oh crap...
indeed
Meanwhile: I have no idea what fugu is. Sounds like a mushroom.
Evening Ponies
AttackWithHugs: Pufferfish.
Meanwhile: Fugu have poisonous organs that can be removed. Xenomorphs have acidic blood that will end you all over.
AttackWithHugs: it's a super poisonous fish
Kriel_Pony: Still, dangerous
Vordox: Well watched that whole video and I've seen all those films. Numerous times ~_~
Evening PaladinDrakkenwolf.
hiya PaladinDrakkenwolf
FairysHuff: Then out of ideas :P
AgentKalim: Yes they have cousins called Xenomuffins
hi PaladinDrakkenwolf
PANICMISSILES!
AttackWithHugs: True! Actually, considering the acid in the movies... probably worse than poison
Vordox: Yeh, not many good alien invasion films
Meanwhile: Ohh. People are weird. "Oh this is poisonous! LET'S EAT IT!"
oh its midnight
BEEDROIDS
Xenomuffins. 6_9

YES
Calcos323: there is, The Naked Gun series
It's time for The Naked Gun!
THE NAKED GUN YES
YES IT IS!
AgentKalim: I thought we decided these weren't xenomorphs, besides do you know how hard it is to remove the poison from fugu?
what game is this?
13ping
AttackWithHugs: Ikr.
pong
Shizuka: pong, hello dear how are you today?
Shizuka: Holla! :)
Meanwhile: Humans *awesome face*
PaladinDrakkenwolf: Abuse aka YOU DIE ALOT
K_A: Man, pong gets intense.
Shizuka, you are a goddess for picking TNG
Hello Shikuza!
Allo Shizuka.
OH GOD BEES!
I thought we decided that since they look like Xenomorphs and jump around on the walls like Xenomorphs, they are TOTALLY xenomorphs.
hi Shizuka
Hello Shizuka :)
yellow = not good with Splash Damage, Blue = Not good with direct Damage.
BEES THEY'RE IN MY EYES!
Mooovieees?
Hello Shizuka
13Calcos323: i didn't pick it
Hi Shizuka!
not the beedroids!
AttackWithHugs: Oh no, you turned into Lyra
Vordox: I just remembered a REALLY bad space alien invasion film.... WingCommander the movie
Shizuka: Then you're a Goddess for playing it, whatever.
Also, what game is htis? It brings back long lost memories-
Hi Shizuka
BRB GUYs gotta turn on laundry
AttackWithHugs: Personally I like trying new food.
FairysHuff: No idea. =/
Tonight, we're watching Star Trek: The Naked Gun
Vordox: If you haven't seen it you should. It's really bad. And the games are really good
What.
Meanwhile: I wouldn't mind trying new foods either. But I have a limit. One of them being raw seafood of ANY kind.
Kandarihu: You mean The Naked Phaser
Kandarihu: :D
HatchetRyda: And how am I turning into Lyra?
Sushi is pretty nice, surprisingly
Just easy on the vinegar
Dat Abuse sushi
This game looks awesome
Fried food can still be sushi though
Well, Phaser doesn't fit the backgronym
AttackWithHugs: you got a big awesomeface when he mentioned Humans
AttackWithHugs: Raw seafood. Generally not a good idea to eat anything raw. Even sushi is still technically cooked in a manner.
pew pew pew!
05well guys
I think if you fry beef in vinegar it can be called Sushi?
Star Trek: The Naked Gowron
05its been an awesome stream for me

You know, Leslie Nielsen was old and mature. The reason he can deliver jokes in such a deadpan manner is because he's simply not overcome by emotions.

While a parody of many television shows and movies, it bore a particular resemblance to the Lee Marvin cop show, M Squad (especially the opening credits) and the late 1960s series Felony Squad.[2] Although cancelled after only six episodes, it spawned the successful Naked Gun film series. :'(
She carries a lot of guns

hahahaha
Sigh..... things like that is very depressing :(
that sweat wipe
uh oh
I hate Steam
ALL THE STEAM

Join Steam today
DarkStar: Did they take the culprit or was it an accident?
DarkStar, Bronysith: You have my condolences and best wishes to you and her family.
dat autofire
not so good
sucks we'll never see Princess_Molestia ever again
she was funny
^
Not the blender
It's chilling. I think I've seen her on here.
Vordox, she was with a drunken friend at the time.
bye Princess_Molestia, we will miss you :(
I didn't realize we were talking about a person. Sorry for my careless words.
that washer
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2: suck's that the month is almost over and no party.mov
lol
wow
What a way to cover an action scene through steam. "That was an awesome fight! Too bad you couldn't see it"
DarkStar: And the drunk one...drove?
DarkStar: fucking alcohol
DarkStar: well that makes sense
i will never drink alchohol in my life. ever
beer really tastes bad
Well flutterchu, he has been busy doing Jappleack. But since he hasn't updated it in a week, maybe he's working on Party now?
that pwn
i really doubt i will drink
TKO
Time to go rocky balboa on your shit!
DarkStar: did the drunk one survive?
now where is mario counting till 3?
I don't drink or hang with drunkards because I am terrified of accidents and violence and memory loss
DAT ZELDA
Darkts3 is right, we do need a new Molestia
ZELDA
thirsty?
JESmith71: jappleack's awsome
DarkStar: Just know that she's in a better place and she is happy that you keep her in your heart.
He can count to Thursday!
No, they both died
:D
:(
IT WAS ZELDA!
:(
DarkStar: ah, because it would be stupid of the Drunk friend got no injury
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2: YOU NEVER SHOULD WISH FOR SOMEONE TO DIE
EVER
YOU HEAR ME?!

DarkStar: what happened to the old Molestia?
Vordox: i said INJURY
Vordox: i didnt say death
that desk
XD
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2: Good, I hate people who wish harm, no matter what, on other people.
HatchetRyda: there was a brony in this chat called Princess_Molestia...
HatchetRyda: she died
You shouldn't wish harm on anyone, but sometimes it's deserved
So are you running through all the Police Squad eps in one go, or are you going to save some for the next two nights?
But still, you should never say something evil to anyone
HatchetRyda: she just died
ooooooo

the grand galloping gala!
Classy music gets my cat in the mood again.
Darf14: dream of Ponies
Vordox, I completely agree, you shouldn't wish harm on anyone or hold grudges like that
DarkStar: I lost one of my friends who literally lived next to me. As long as your sister knows that you have happy memories of her, she will always be alive
It's also getting to be feeding time, so that makes more sense.
Vivix: People do with their life what they want, but never should let anyone else get into trouble for their own mistakes....
That's the thing I hate about humanity. ><
Most people are nice, I live by that rule
but everyone makes mistakes, poorly judged words or rash emotions
everyone say things they regret-
And it's always the best one that gets into harm...
XD
Always..

:[ it is an outrage!
Vordox: I remember being made fun of back in school because I was reading at every opportunity I had, and I didn't sit in the back of the bus because the black kids there made fun of me and called me ugly (I had bad acne as a 13 year old)
I forgot what I was thinking about
Tigertonic_The_Cat: I know its hard bro...I know -lol the universe is testing us >:3
Maid_Discord: No More?
question: do the cutie mark cusaders still work for the foal free press
AttackWithHugs: ssame here dude im 14 and i have a well its not so bad but i have a little acne in mah forehead
flutterchu: no -lol
I realized something terrible with all the reading I've been doing lately; I'm worse at my native language than I am at english, atm.
AttackWithHugs: Oy, calm down. No need to go to why you act why you act, that's not something for us to hear unless you specifically want it to
I'm not even sure why I was bullied in class. Probably because I was easy to bully.
ah AH, AAAHHHH; cho
http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3pv4ey/
oh dear
pinkilicious...
Vivix: ouch
AttackWithHugs: you are who you are, that's final, the things in the past are what should be there.
SolairePony89: btw http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3pv4e6/ sexy no?
I will just say that
I forget how to spell difficult words, I need to read more books in my own language
can i send a link now?
Vordox: It's made me a little stronger. I become a smart-ass if someone tries to make fun of me
08,01oh man, i'm wetting myself at some of these memes
PaladinDrakkenwolf: chin hair is called a beard
08,01PaladinDrakkenwolf: i do not
He had..pink hair at the time? I can't remember
Bronysith: or a Goatee
Vordox: A little too much of a smart-ass but still fun
AttackWithHugs: I got picked on because I learned my times tables faster than my other black classmates.
11,01This is it for me. Sumica is next.
AttackWithHugs: ikr
yay Sumi!
Vivix: I think he might of at some time
thanks for streaming Nittany_Discord
AttackWithHugs: Anything that made me seem not ignorant really I got picked on for.
thanks for the stream Nittany_Discord
thx for stream Nittany_Discord
I think I remember pink hair, yeah
Thanks for the stream Nittany_Discord
I was picked on because I spoke a different dialect
sorry I was gone long guys

08,01PaladinDrakkenwolf: this is what i look like irl http://imgur.com/leF5M
gotta fold laundry
i was picked on at school because im a brony
got in fights and stuff as a kid, but most kids do, nothing serious or really angry
Iron_Edge: It's because they're insecure inside. The ones that get picked on are usually the ones that life works out for later on. Sometimes.
dat hair color
epic
You look smart
11,01I'm not off to bed.
Nittany_Discord: night
cachi01: don't worry about the acne too much. It's natural and it'll go away in a few years. Just keep washing your face daily to prevent more from coming up
AttackWithHugs: well I'm a blacksmith now. I make good money. I have good friends (bronystate) so I cant complain -lol
Satur, did you really change your hair colour?
Nittany_Discord: Later /)
11,01I said I'm NOT off to bed.
AttackWithHugs: thx for the tip´!

I'm 23 and I still have some acne, depending on the type it might take years

Nittany_Discord: How is the Moves Like Jagger video with Soldier banned?
00,02Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, well worth it
Phase4: How was Quantum Conundrum?
00,02Sumica, indeed
no, RED makes it go faster

are the thrusters vectoring?
11,01I finally got some spaceplanes flying.
or non-vector
11,01Just not flying far.
There is a distinct lack of wheels on that rocket.
Nittany_Discord: Aww, I want to see a spaceplane make it to the moon
11,01Spaceplane physics needs working in the game.
lots and lots of jets and planes!
Sumica: I see the fault of your designs on your gas guzzling rocket, you need more wheels and more engines silly
go a bit SLOWBRO
I got one flying 25 minutes. Even landed it. But it never stops rolling after touchdown
oh wow still up
xD
00,02Nittany_Discord, what your saying is your designs are ok, the game is wrong?
http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3pv4ln/

Sumica: could have been a drill
Wait, freeze pause....

flutterchu: If you want to know more about the Lollipop Chainsaw, you could always go on Youtube
How can you can

Yep that should fix it....
Rip an ISO :|
Methinks this is never gonna work
Aren't they aready ripped LOL
using a PS3
ohright
good question
Sumica: thats why we created hackers :P
Excellent point Sumica
only a jailbroken 1/2nd gen can rip a SACD ISO
This, here, is an example of The Perfect Plan.
i just looked it up why is everyone so much into women
By having no fixed goal in mind, it cannot, under any circumstance, be said to ahve failed.
Scumbag Sony :<
nothing else can. you can play on other things, buty ou can't rip
Failure is always an option
it needs thrust
CANNOT FAIL
but how can one fail, if success is undefined?
who goes in the spike room
00,02while(1) { fail() }
sumicaI thought you were on a carrier
they live!
Welp, that was quick
they died for a worthy cause
Luucky little bastards :p
Sumica: MAKE IT BIGGER!
oh they lived?
nvm
:D
clearly you need bigger booms.
Everyone on Kerbal dreams of being a Kerbonaut. And dying in a gruesome way.
00,02oooo
00,02vps

But you can customise them
Looool.
SolairePony89: nero is kinda slow and mellow
"It was MEANT ot do that!"
you want to kiil them?
Dont mean to sound like a noob, but who is streaming atm?
because the spin got too high
Sumica is streaming
the game has a very low tolerance for spin
oh
RoboGerbil: I kinda like them, still
DESTROY US ALL!

[SWAG]Haku: /)
Hahaha. :D
I'm in a Skype call then the airport intercom came on

Why exactly are you making it spin and grin?
they still live
Stormman31000: Why not? It's silleh
ok, here's how you do it. mount solid engines, then use fuel lines?
Have all the engines pointing in a sigle direction!

00,02did i miss much?
Is this game free?
No idea
two rows should do
whats even the point of this?
Are you trying to get to space?

IT IS THEIR DESTINY
Talk abotu reinventing the wheel again...WITH ROCKETS

This is either the most destructively inhumane thing ever. Or the most epic. -lol
Sumica get it into the ocean and spin
SolairePony89: okay, just got done trying out the new Penny Arcade game. it's funny so far
Shut up and take Hakus money!
Phase4: What about that list?
Wel atleast somepony was nice to say hi. Hello MahBoi777 :)
00,02Sumica, a few less wings and they should stay on
Sumica: that was insane
boooo
00,02SolairePony89, theres a 'this wensday' on that list
5.1 wing power
Ponies47: how are you doing?
MahBoi777: Fine :P
Mutterguy - they just had the best carny ride ever... better than the tilt a whril or gravitron
second stage?
i guess storm
God Almighty that was insane
Ponies47: gooooood
otakon: I heard something about a new Penny Arcade game, not much info though
Ponies47: sup bro /)

00,02Mutterguy, yeah
Phase4: Oh, sweet! :D
00,02sumi has nova punch installed
Make sure it doesnt have symmetry lol
oooh
Dis gon b gud
I'll need to look

00,02it isnt?
INB4 parents go Y U LISTEN TO JAPANESE MOOSICZ AT MIDNIGHT .v.
00,02ah
00,02wait what
SolairePony89: indeed
00,02memory leaks in .net
00,02seems legit
SolairePony89: well, the LIVE version has been delayed till next week bc of a crashing bug. BUT! The Steam version is go, it's basically a 16 throwback RPG done by the guy who did Breath of Death VII and Cthuhlu Saves The World, which are two funny 8 bit throwback RPG's
MahBoi777: I gotta say, my body is ready for Meet the Pyro :p
me too!
Sumica: ROUND 2!
Lol
Phase4 I'm in a weird Skype call
Hello everypony
I think this can replace the space shuttle. It looks legit
hiya DaemonLucius

MahBoi777: me to

00,02Ah

Mixe51n

spinny spin
:s
pony_7007: spinning, so much spinnying
DaemonLucius: Sup bro /)
otakon: Yeah, I remeber seeing a preview of the game on Xplay methinks. didn't appeal to me much, but that's because it's turn-based (I think), and I hate turn basted RPGs
pony_7007: the fear has escalated so much they've lost it
shouldn't they be dead?
So...
DaemonLucius: 'Ello, mate!
00,02lol
its spinning..
00,02it wont take off

ah
SolairePony89: your loss, I love em
Iron_Edge (\
BEST RIDE EVAR
Sumica: it needs UPWARD THRUST!
oh god
nah
otakon: Turn-based RPGs I'm getting a love for though
lol
oh shit :D
needs more POWER
to bad
well, at least they're alive
Sumica: Find a way to make it explode so the Kerbals die after the spinning
put a straight thrust under it
if it spontaneously combusted I wud have lost it:D
Herro xD

Herro, prease
Pick up the phone, its Haku

Ching-chong ping-pong
MahBoi777 he's ahad a couple do that

Noo wice for yuuu
ponibas|TERA: Lol awesome
oh, Play that Funky music vs Just to get a rep from DJ Hero
What about spinning on a non functional engine?
SolairePony89: the first two had a modern 3D adventure game look and the combat was turn based active combat. If your timing was good you could increase you damage done and reduce damage taken. THink ATB with QTE's.
Sumica,does this mean I shouldn't call??
OH God
anyone seen this yet? http://www.teamfortress.com/pyromania/
rdibp: EVERYONE has here

otakon: Still a turn-based RPG, which I do not like. Otherwise I'd probably be interested in it. Oh well
and then the G-forces kill them
What the fuuu is going on
no, it was like I was explaining before. As long as you have no fixed goal in mind (except perhaps beyond "for science!"), whatever happens is a success.
sagas[A]: They need to die SOME way
shoudl turn the wings a little so it acts like a helicopter
my steam games lags, i mean LAG BEYOND LAG
SolairePony89: like I said, the first two are more like realtime turn based combat.
lol watch it eject the Kerbals because of the G-s lol
Are we playing moonbase alpha
you got this
rdibp: you need to check if you video card is properly drivered
sonicdude558: no
