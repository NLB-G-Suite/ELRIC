I wish my Italian language class was tomorrow
Nope.

Anyways, goodnight
I'm just waiting for an opportunity to get leverage.
I can probably spend more time tomorrow on here
What's the problem?
We have a router
it is connected via ehternet to house PC
i have a laptop
it detects the router wirelessly
*Warns Sky that she hasn't had her V8 yet and she's a slap away from needing one*
when I click to connect ( i know it has a pass i got that) windows says
|HAve fun with Italian Sausage class
getting information from WLAN_blahblah
Mmmm, sausage class
and then after like 20 seconds of this
'windows was unable to connect to this network'
Have fun hating me for no reason =D
Now, if i connect my laptop, like right now, via ethernet it owrks
thing is my room's on the other side of the house
How I wireless has?
also, other wireless networks I try give me the 'password:'
message
but MY one just goes 'getting info' then 'unable'
: /
Does it have an error message/code/number?
hmm no i don't think so
What OS are you on?
ofc i've looked online, but the solutions are 'reset pc/roouter' done that
Windows 7 x64 : /
Other online solutions are 'derp enable discovery' which ofc i have enabled
i had this problem like a few months ago at a friends house
Have you tried wireless on that laptop before?
Has it ever worked?
02<random> A psychic once told me that I'm psychic. </random>
yes for 2 years in .... 11 networks
just checked
06o.o
i only had this problem once before, and after much 'disable wireless card enable wireless card' it worked
Just wondered if you knew what it was
Have you tried removing the password on then network to see if that makes any difference?
I haven't tried that but it's my dad's network, with just the pass on the back of the router, the one it comes with.
i guess i could try that
I'M BAAAAAAAAAACK!
Hey Pegacorn
Hi Pegacorn
Are you using wireless zero configuration?
Or some other wireless client?
i don't really know what that means
Windows + R
services.msc
i'm just using my wireless card
No,i tried to get the Minecraft shirts in Battlefield Heroes (yarly)
/me sits all over Espeon
Scroll down and check wireless zero conifugration to see if it's running.

Do you know exactly what it says when you try to connect to the network?
do you want printscreenie?

lol, why 'brb' if it takes like 1 minute?
sometimes there's buildup too far in the ear for qtips to reach
also lol
PUNS
03but yeah, that's basically what it was
I was filling my water bottle.
MFW "shut up and take my money" was actually said in futurama.
03they said there was some earwax that got stuck in a position so that it blocked my eardrum
03hence why I couldn't hear
yes
um
03kinda odd that it happened overnight but hey, what do I know
this is where the meme comes from
I've never seen the episode before. :)
It's Silverscreen
11hi
Ohai Silverscreen
11hi
03WTF eBay
03apparently I can't add international shipping as an option after the auction has already starte
03d
03why :|
03oh, apparently it's because someone already bid on it
03that's stupid
Meh.
Oooooh,did we kill the chat again?
lol, the elements of gaming fanfic
The graphics they showcase don't look 100,000 times better.
it has a link to a youtube video i've seen before and it's awesome :P
I guess it isn't that good, but it's definitely an improvement
dude
drf
have you seen horrible bosses?
14LOL
Plus no real evidence that the techonology actually exists. :P
I was gonna ask you but forgot until kyu reminded me
03no
03I want to
03brb though
k
i know
TRUE DAT.
I wonder how long till someone makes virtual reality.
i wonder that too
but eh
Probably 20 years or so.
Or maybe 20 years or so till someone makes the matrix.
And the machines take over.
and we blot out the sky
anypony seen the animatrix?
11MAC or PC, which do you prefer?
You need to ask?
:P
lol
11Yes.
I prefer PC because it's what i'm used to, but I don't think it's 'superior in erry way to mac'
Macs...Eugh.
i haven't got a CLUE as to how to use macs
I prefer PCs.
11I'm a PC person.
but i can use pcs good
PC
w00t
OMAGAD!
Macs are like the Windows Vista of computers.
:P
You fixed it?
IT IT IT after like 5 hours IT is asking me for a password
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Lol, well that's good then.
(my guess is that the router is very very old and my laptop not so old
ok time to test it out
off goes the ethernet cable
. . .
YEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAA
LOL
LOL wut?
I thought your interenet had exploded just after you said it worked.
Irony.
hahaha
twice
nah
IT WORKIES ^_^ =D
so now i ... crap. now i won't be able to sleep :
Well, I dunno, if anyone wants me to.
:P
11My arguements for PCs against Mac users:
11 1. Macs are overpriced computers that have the exact same compatibilities as a PC that's only a quarter of the cost. 2. The only reason Macs don't get Viruses is because they aren't as popular and thus haven't warrented that much attention. 3. When something breaks on a PC, you don't have to get rid of the WHOLE FUCKING COMPUTER to get it fixed.
i like 3.
3. is a good point
11And technically, Macs ARE PCs, just with a brand name.
true dat
;__;
;_;
11Apple invented computers. Microsoft perfected them.
Apple invented computers? Wut
/me glomps
eyedonno
02kooooosooooveeeooon~
11Didn't Apple start before Microsoft?
11forget it, I'm talking shit now. *shuts up*
/me 11watches Lewis Black.
Dman: Sure.
03oh god
03I feel sick
=D yay~
11I should get streaming software. I have Netflix.
11Netflix stream to me. I stream to Brony State. All win.
sounds good
Why does Apple make out as though the iPad is something completely new and creative? O_o
hahaha
Hi Silverscreen
11Hi.
/me is glomped o.o
/me glomps back "Hi :3"
11The Ipad is a fucking stupid idea.
apple: you have phones then you have pcs and ipad is a 3rd product' the world: 'lolnope'
The iPad is just a tablet with apps on it.
Wut.
Why is that so good?
i'm saying it isn't
I know.
apple make iPad to be a 3rd product type
It was just a rhetorical question .:P
'tablets'
wtf no
11The owner of an Ipad: "lol, I like having an Ipod Touch that I can't fit in a pocket."
true dat
the owner of other tablets: 'lol, i like having an inferior pc with awful input system'
true
11Seriously, the Ipad is just an oversized Ipod Touch. Apple would have been better off giving us the first touch-screen laptop.
11But no. Ipad.
Apple do do touch-screen laptops, don't they?
true dat
Or is that just other people?
iPod classic is only apple product i have and probably will ever need :P
11Only after people bitched about the Ipad.
Oh.
!pokemon
Kosoveon, you are a 10Froslass.
Microsoft is the most awesome company from what I've seen though.
11Mac books are the same as PC laptops.
!pokemon
but they break easier
Roara, you are a 4Pawniard.
wrong gender
nope
11Microsoft is alright. They don't fuck over their clients in terms of service and supplies.
They really treat their employees well at Microsoft.
Appol engeenoor: "gais gais it fits in a monillo onvolope!"
The workplace is SO AWESOME there.
03I keep reading that as Pawn Star
I have 2 friends I know who work at microsoft. one is ehish job, but other works on excel
he says it's awesome
!pokemon
nice
11The only annoying thing about Microsoft is their fucking Vista OS, which they quickly realized was a mistake.
Yes, BUT
do not forget
Lawl, one of the tech guys at Microsoft just said "Don't talk about Vista, it doesn't exist".
To me.
true dat,but i have vista.
11IT does exist. I HAVE TO FUCKING USE IT. >.<
hahaha
I have 7
sivlerscreen - go to xp or 7 den
11I want to, but my comp is designed for Vista, and I don't know what'll happen if I change the OS.
>designed for an OS
wut
I've upgraded 5 family members' vista laptops to 7 so far
you should do it. srsly.
11Well, what I mean is that Vista came with it, and I'm not sure how it'll work with suddenly switching the OS.
heh heh hahaha
/me 11is derp when it comes to computer tech. 6_9
Microsoft surface is where it's at though.
11Surface?
mfw 7 worked better than all of the above
Surface 2.0 <3
14!pokemon
11The problem with Windows 7 is how much fucking Ram and memory it takes up.
The most fucking awesome thing I have ever seen in action.
Microsoft must be trollin'
May, you are a 7Blastoise.
14sweet o3o
why wub dwis
We got to play around with Surface. :>
11Microsoft surface. We'd be fucked if you got that table scratched.
Yfw this is possible TODAY if the world were owned by only one tch company : /
oh god the 'it's intuitive' line. that's one commercial line i'm getting sick of lol
12o3o
12!Pokemon
11This entire comercial is formulaic.
i know : /
but but but
soon.jpg
03!pokemon
I don't even give a fuck.
Having played with it for real.
12yay
03LOL i'm old as a fossil
03that might make sense
11OH MY GOD. XD
11I just thought of something.
what?
14XD
11Microsoft beat Apple to making the ITable.
I've played with similar stuff by other companies and it's fun but nothing advancing in usage. it stops being fun after 5 minutes. so eh
Oh yes silverscreen
Microsoft have had surace made for ages.
Apple are always last, but one of the best, in nearly all industry
This is 2.0
6ok so
6I'm housesitting right
6well, I pulled a lovely blonde move today
12Roara~~~
6forgot the inside garage door was locked at the knob
mp4 players, computers, laptops
6so it wont open from the garage side
I'm pretty sure Surface is years older than iPad even.
HELL THEY BROUGHT OUT THEIR FIRST MONITOR only months ago
6I went into the garage with the dog so I could take him for a walk
6.....forgot the door was locked
This video.
viewan
6and it shut
MFW Microsoft employee told me 90% of the stuff in it is already possible
And is already made.
it's SO AWESOME
14So you had to open the garage door?
6went through the main door to the front door
6and forgot that my OCD kicked in, and because I hate having an unlocked front door when I'm the only one home
it's why i said earlier
Yfw this is possible TODAY if the world were owned by only one tch company : /
6I forgot I locked that one too
6and because I'd been gone all morning, the back door was locked too
Microsoft. Y U NO GIEF ME DIS STOOFZ NAO
03so Roara, there's a version of Speed that comes with a Digital Copy®. I bought it for kicks, and I'll rip it XD
6so basically there I was, tossing the frisbee for the dog while trying to think of a way to break into a police officer's home
appol. mocrosoft. Y u no join forzez fur teh human raez advanzumenunt?
Dat electronic newspaper.
so i already askedbut
I dunno, some of the employees talked about it, we didn't get a demonstration though.
11It's funny, because when Iron Man 1 came out, Microsoft downright said that the interactive modling that Tony Stark used was 100% achievable in this day and age. Hence them multiplying that in Iron Man 2.
6I felt like an idiot though
it is full of fail i'm afraid
6I finally got in by dragging the ladder out of the garage, hopping the fence to unlock the gate, taking the ladder to the bathroom window (which is on a slope so it's too high to reach normally)
Iron Man 2 inception : his heartpiecethingy is the entire attractionareathingy
6climbed through the window, unlocked the doors
11whut?
6and then just for whatever reason...checked the front porch
hisfacewhen his father had already before dying years before invented teh ultimate molecule
I don't get why Microsoft are making a big deal about "cloud computing" all of a sudden, it's as though they've made a new term and decided it's 'the future' of Microsoft even though it's been around for ages.
6found a key hidden under the flowers x.x
Silverscreen - you seen Iron Man 2? :P
Well, they even told us it was the future of Microsoft.
14fail XD
Office 365.
>_>
<_<
Boring.
11Yes, I saw Iron Man 2. The core was slowly killing him due to the pallideum alloy that was used to power the core.
LOL
yea
and the molecule for a sustainable core
I love how this spoof is a mac too.
it's marcorstructure
was already designed into the park's design
it's all there, bro
11mactini.
11LOL
LOL
i've seen loads of funny mac parodies, but not this one
>letter z gys?

actually you know what the movies aren't that bad
03then that's fine
not great but not worstthingever
7I can squeeze them in, I bet.
7Since you only have one image...
03and sigh, calculator programming would be SO much easier if there was an "infinity" symbol, like there is a theta etc
03no
03I mean I only have one image on my calculator presently.
03the one you made me before
7Ah.

hahaha
11I just found it.
problems imminent
well, I for one would pick the opportunity to torture the viewers as long as possible
silverscreen - what you uploading?
/me throws tortilla chips at Ray
Spider's Web was a short film too.
:P
11Dman: the updated version of my movie trailer.
certainly didn't feel like it though
As soon as Circuit logs in I am going ahead and skyping him
lol
oh wow danny
This won't feel short ever.
silverscreen - the movie you'd pick?
G 3.5 episodes are only 10 minutes or so long.
I streamed a couple, felt like hours.
Is it monday night movie madness?
XD
>episodes. more like commercials with no plot
Viewers were made even then.
mad*
11I did a film trailer for X-Men for my Audio / Video editing class.
03LOL
you made you made?
that reminds me, when did you guys say the LotR stream was? Was that like the 26th or something?
silverscreen - ooo wanttosee
26-28?
valthejean, dashite is right
gotcha
26th 27th 28th that is friday saturday sunday August
11 26-28th. One movie each night ++ 2 pony episodes.

Good thing I'm not going (crappy line up).
ah thats ok then

11let me upload this and I can have you all watch.

I could look for a few youtubes for you to enjoy, though I'd have to go looking for them
Supposedly we will start getting ready for the show at 20-30 minutes before.

11"About 1 min. remaining"
yay
The Brony Show
ah
I am a panel member tonight
ooooo
Its not here
Its on the live stream with the same name
I've never actually seen the brony show yet (dear god don't kill me)
No problem
;o
11I never seen the brony show either.
ohai gaiz
i've seen 2
11What's it about?
Well...
03LOL
they go over load of news

We talk about the news for the fandom
We watch 1-2 episodes

11"Processing video"
/me tried reconnecting earlier but couldn't, thought it was just him
6Ayuppers.
yea ...
I believe it should be in about 45 minutes (If I am judging my timezone correctly)
11I want to do a Siskel and Ebert esque review.
11Of a movie
I should double check
oh oh! Can I join? Can I be Ebert? :D
/me 11is totally Roger Ebert in his viewing of movies.
11lol, Val
I miss when it was Ebert and Roper :(
i don't know who either of them are
Lets see...if I am in texas and it starts at 9 eastern....
It should start at either 7 or 8 for me
me neither dman
Am I right about that?
11Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert were two very, VERY talented movie reviewers during the 80's and 90's.
cool
i see
Is Central time zone one or two hours different from eastern?
wait, is Roger Ebert the one with the paralyzed jaw?
I can't say I agreed with them all the time, but they definitely presented movies well
11In fact, I could just post Nostalgia Critics tribute to them if you all want to watch.
Meh, how can you be a talented at reviewing something? Surely it's a majority of opinion based stuff?
11Yes, Ebert's the one with the bad jaw.
lol dari, clearly you've never seen Zero Punctuation :P
well, you can be good at analyzing a work...
11Dari: yes, but the thing is that they cross-examined each other's reviews, making it much more entertaining to watch them.
ValtheJean: Nope, never heard of it.
it goes Eastern, Central, Mountain, Pacific
it's easy to say things are "good", but it's very hard to present WHY
Silverscreen: So, they present the way they present their opinions is good?
Well...then I have an HOUR AND 40 minutes
from East to West
it's a very hillarious video game review
I fucked my timezones up
11http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suYe0HQX5s4
11MY TRAILER :d
so never mind then, Circuit has plenty of time
11:D*
the way they present*
wait a minute...
silverscreen...did you show me this on the brony page before?
facebook, that is
11Yes, but this one's been updated. The audio's been fixed and one or two clips changed.
dat xmen theme
haha, such a small world! This whole time I thought you disappeared :P
I think in the recent Xmen film Mystique (sp?) becoming evil was really poorly done.
I didn't even realize they MADE another
Nicely done
11Haven't seen First Class yet. I heard it's suppose to be a good reboot.
First Class?
Latest X-men movie.
Welp, I better go put my food in the oven, brb
it's as silver put it, a reboot basically (if I understand correctly, haven't seen it)
It's about Xavier and Lensher before they went their separate ways
I thought it was just a prequel?
hmmm
I could be wrong then
11nope. It was a downright Reboot. That's why you see miss Frost in it.
It details events earlier than have been seen before.
It is a prequel, but the way they did it also writes out some of the stuff that happened in Wolverine Origins and X3.
I sthill haven't told him that i'm moving ;__;
i'm lost
I choose to refuse X3 exists
X3 is pretty good
X3 was meh.
Dman: Ahh.
*barf*
X2 was good.
11X3 isn't as bad as people make it out, but it is still pretty bad.
Did you tell him that he made you a brony yet?
Haven't seen X2, though
His face when
>explode
he didn't some other guy idd
Alright, I am back
Oh.
he's the guy who saw one ep and sortaliked denial
Ohhhh.
Yeah.
but he doesn't know about me moving to spain possibly forever. that thing
Right, I know now.
11They changed too much between Wolverine and First class. The continuity (bum) is just...gone.
Obviously someone needs to pick X2 for movie night.
he's the 'pony fetish!' guy haha
And it was changed for the better.
you want to move to spain? Why?
Yeah.
....what?
Who is this we are talking about...?
a guy at school who takes the mick outta me for being a brony
it's funny
Wolverine's one line in First Class was so funny.
Now that Green Latern flopped, can we get Ryan Reynolds moved over to Deadpool? :D
mick? I dont understand your slang
11Dashite: I thought the same thing.
i haven't seen first class yet
He means mickie
Denied_Existence: Seriously?
or however you spell it
Wolverine Origins Deadpool was a travesty. :/
That still tells me nothing
MFW no one understands us Brits.
;__;
You mean like sedatives?
What? Are you trying to say something?
/me 11understands the brits.
ok,i'm back
11WB, pegacorn.
Speak English!
hi ll
>loves British comedy, can't understand when actual British people talk to me >.<
to take the mickie out of someone means to tease them mercelessly, right?
Sprecken sie deutsch?
mercilessly*
Nein
Aha!
What WAS Wolverine's one line in First Class?
:P
nur ein bisschen
03Phew.
03Just in time
He basically told Xavier and Lensher to piss off.
03re-typed all the stupid notes that got erased :|
relativ gut
03now to put them on my calculator and go take a test
Das ist gut!
Dashite,that is epic.
So ein Pech...
lawl es ist nur eine ...kleine deutsche? i don't know lol
yea ein pech
ich spreche ein pech
/me 11wanted to strangle Fox Studio for how they portrayed Gambit.
heh
Sneas!
but i'd love to practice my german!
...no hablo Deutches... :(
um
hallo, wie gehts?
'gehts?
I don't recall having any big issues with Gambit, but maybe I'm just not remembering right.
11Gambit is the second most popular X-man, standing right behind Wolverine.
Sehr gut, und dir?
valthejean hablas espaniol?
@Dman, you speak your bad luck?
What? Second best isn't Jubilee? :D
Ich bin prima! =D
Keine lust...
konichiwa
i speak a little i thought i said
@Dman yo hablo espanol...god damn can't remember the word...pequina?
valthejean - yo hablo poco espanol
Ich spreche ein Pech= I speak bad luck.
ah, knew it was something with a p
Or I speak a bad luck
but i didn't say pech?
11They made him a freaking farm boy rather than having his Cajun accent, they turned him into a downright pansy who got his ass kicked. Hell, the only thing they got right with him was his abilities, and even that they didn't use too much. On top of all that, he only had, what, fifteen to twenty minutes of screen time? If that?
oh
<Dman>: ich spreche ein pech
cuz you said 'ein pech#
i was like 'that probably means a little'
Ja, So ein Pech=What bad luck! or just Bad luck!
Ah, okay. I got the issue now.
Das ist meine lieblingsfach, lieblingsfach, lieblingsfach.

They play it in all the school? XD AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
they've been ruining too many good comic heroes...
03well guys
11Not really...
03off to take a math exam
03wish me luck :|
DC has been ruining their heroes.
at least Watchmen was alright...would have liked better story consistency, but the characters were solid
Marvel has been doing a pretty good job.
11They did Iron Man and Hulk justice. Batman is Badass again. From what I hear, THOR was, while underwhelming, faithful to its roots...
God...I am hungry as hell...
eh, Iron Man 1 I would have agreed with, but 2 was just awful
11DC needs to do what Marvel did and make its own studio.
2 wasn't awful. 2 wasn't as good as 1, but it wasn't awful.
11Why Aweful? I agree a lot of it was just silly buildup for Avengers, but it wasn't bad.
11Besides, 2 has FUCKING WAR MACHINE! :D
http://img198.imageshack.us/img198/3020/shrugponybigmacbymoonga.png
well, for fear of drawing out a giant flame war, I'll just agree to disagree :P
Aw, come on! We want reasons!
:p
/me 11goes with Denied's response.
I'm rather picky when it comes to movies
:<
I hate to admit it, but I'm a bit of an elitist when it comes to film. (I try really hard not to...but there it is)
:<
11What does everyone think of the Spiderman reboot?
/me goes with 'comic book movies? who watches those?'
Meh.
didn't know they did a reboot
They have a Spiderman Reboot?
They haven't yet.
Considering the films aren't that old yet.
They're working on it.
11Not yet.
It seems a bit stupid.
well, at least they realize they've run the current spiderman into the ground
11I agree, but you know them companies. MONEY MONEY MONEY!!!
They have to do something with it or the license reverts back to Marvel.
better they start new then try to revive that thing
lods of emone
11Val: The only reason they ran the old one into the ground is because they fucked up the Symbiote plot.
That was horrible. I loved that story line. :(
well, and hired Toby McGuire :P
11McGuire wasn't bad as Parker. : /
Emo Toby for Spiderman 3.
lol
The dance scene.
WTF man...
11oh god, Emo Peter.
it may just come from my unprecedented hatred of everything Toby does
LOL
The dance scene. XD
How do you guys think percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Sea of Monsters will be as a film?
11FUCK THE PERCY JACKSON MOVIE FRANCHISE!!!!!!!!
they're actually making that?
It is currently in development

FEAR ME FOR I HAVE MASTERED REACTION IMAGES!
lol
11The actors seemed only half interested in the action, the characters didn't look or act the part half the time, AND IT FUCKING RUINED THE MYTHOLOGY IT'S BASED ON!!!
11The damn Percy Jackson movie showed absolutly NO respect for either the books or the greek mythology.
lol, is suddenly reminded of the recent Clash of the Titans movies
movie*
11It was obviously a cheep cop out for the studio to make a lot of money off a good idea.
I did think the 'YOU BURNING MONEY!? THIS IS A RECESSION!' Joke was funny
SCOOTABRU!!!
11the first Clash of the Titans was good. While it didn't have it's mythology 100% accurate, it at least had SOME semblance of the true myths, and it was actually entertaining.
@Silverscreen agreed
O.o
the recent one was...*shiver*
Who set Silverscreen onto a tirade?
11Refuse to see the new Clash of the Titans.

it's a complete waste of money

11er,

I'd never heard of the term "hipster" until someone explained Hipster_Brony's name. XD
11"Spent the entire weekend in a marathon of Avatar: The Last Airbender. It was fucking epic. Sat down to watch The Last Airbender movie. Couldn't even make it to the 15 minute mark before turning that piece of shit off."
so is anyone else loving the Bruce Mayne thing?
yup
/me rages
Silverscreen, thoughts on the upcoming Battleship movie? :D
@Silverscreen lol, that movie actually made me physically unable to watch the show again, despite how awesome it is
11That movie looks stupid.
02Today isn't my day .-.
what's next, a Clue movie?
11Elky: Yes.
lol
OH GOD NO
AAAAAAGGGH
the Clue movie was fucking brilliant
11They are planning a remake of the original Clue movie.
Tim Curry...I love you
that's M Night Shitalan for ya
they...WHAT???
11Why they couldn't just make Battleship a basic awesome Warship Battle movie?
I SUNK YOUR BATTLESHIP
I WILL GO DOWN TO THEIR OFFICES AND BURN THEIR HEATHENISTIC HEADS FOR DARING TO TAMPER WITH THE SACRED NAME OF CLUE
A-whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
yeah, why did Battleship have to bring in fucking aliens?
The alien shoots pegs at the battleship. :D
lol
ReticentSmolder: Sounds like the last Indianna Jones film.
Baww
?
why
:(
Why the aliens? Always that aliens...
oh god...Indiana Jones...
the*
Dari, so magic is okay, but not aliens?
11Think about it: Diplomatic affairs causes two sea boats to meet in the middle of the ocean. A HUGE battle between both sea armies, including arial battles and hand-to-hand combat, ensues. CUE LOTS OF MONY MAKING!
What next? Zombie battleship commanders!?
que the South Park "They're raping him" scene
02I'm sucking badly at games today ._.
Not that ValtheJean!Please not that!
02Everything from Taiko to N+
lol
11Aliens are WAAAAY too overused nowadays.
you gotta admit, that episode was hillarious
maybe, yes
good movie? HAVE SOME FREE ALIENS
It really doesn't.
11Battleship is just a lame excuse for big science fiction effects.
11it doesn't?
11well..
11still...
11It looks good.
It's entertaining enough.
@enragedmeter Silverscreen
6 Silverscreen is 10% enraged. (563)
Hmm...
I hears Cowboys and Aliens was okay
@tiredmeter Dman
I must be getting false positives from the shrug ponies...
6 Dman is 44% tired. (564)
Hmm...
11If you want to make a good movie based off of a board game, make a movie based on Guess Who.
'does he look like a bitch?'
http://arch.413chan.net/luna_don%60t_go_to_bed-(n1310948662544).png
11lol, Dman
FUCK
why one would make a movie based on a game is beyond me anyway
board games: shit
video games: uwe boll
denied_existence i saw it
Shit computer is shit!
@ValtheJean:Actually,i thought that episode was tasteless.
Hmm...
11You just said shit is better than Uwe Boll
denied_existence do you have any huggable :3 pics of Luna?
11You, sir, just commited blasphemy
Let me see...
denied_existence it's the chat, it doens't count ( ) as part of links
@Pegacorn really? Have you watched other SP episodes or was that your first?
Well, there are varying degrees of shit...
I have some on my iPhone, let me get them
ty
@ValtheJean:I did watch other episodes before it,namely the WoW episode and "Good times with Weapons".
11I can understand making a movie based on a board game. Because board games don't have a story, and if they do, it's really vague.
11Video games on the other hand...no point.
11Video games are just interactive movies on their own.
funny silverscreen
Resi evil 1 wasn't bad
but wasn't at all like the videogame
2 and 3 are awful
@Pegacorn hmmm. Well, I don't really know what to say. I guess to each his own?
and 4 was incredibly fun to watch as it was almost identical to videogames
lol, Dman, sorry but I hated the RE1 movies...well, all of them
movie(
jeez...my grammar today
4 is also awful, but fun to watch
The Doom movie!
>dat final 10 mins
@ValtheJean:Eeyup,to each his own.
11The Doom movie was fucking awesome, and I don't care what anyone says.
lol
I just don't think movies based on games should exist
How do I put up a picture from my computer?
The only good part of that movie was the FPS section.
they just shouldn't
my dad had the film for years and only later found out it was vidya
two completely different mediums, not meant to interact
Silverscreen, how do I put a picture off my computer up here?
Nopony should diss The Rock OR Doom,unless they want to get the hell beaten outta them.
11So does that mean we shouldn't have video games based on movies either?
eeyup
Of course.
those are even worse
sadly yes
i say sadly because spiderman 2 was amazing
Have you played any of those licensed games?
11Street Fighter: the Video Game.
never was a fan of Street Fighter
Street Fighter: The movie: the Video Game.
what?
suddenly it sucks now don't it?
and yeah, I've played several of the licensed games
hahaha
it's a joke
11The shitty-ass game, based off the shitty-ass movie, based on the kick-ass game.
yea silver that's the joke ; )
o.o
11I know, I was explaining it to Barry.
didn't they make a mortal kombat movie at one point?
How the hell do I post pics from my computer?
I think there's a trope for that
11Val: Yes.
yea
lol, the Street Fighter movie? was it as bad as Mortal Kombat?
They made 3 MK movies I think.
jackie chan IS CHUN
or something
O_o
Does nobody know?
THREE?
Fanboys...I am disappoint
I liked the first one
I saw the first one
/me YOUR SOUL IS MINE!
@silverscreen How the HELL do I post pics from my computer up here?
11The MK movie was...okay. It was at least watchable. The second MK movie was fucking stupid. The third I never saw.
Anyway, since we were talking about aliens earlier.
>Stream
D_E you need to upload them to an image hosting site first.
11Denied: post them on TinyPic and post the link here.
/me 6blinks.
@Denied_existence you need an html link, otherwise it won't work
Damn internet loopholes
suddenly, stream

i say it's not as good as other

I liked the gameplay, but the story was eh...
it's still good
the story is very VERY japanese esque.
/me 11is an extremely casual player.

perhaps ED posted 55 'stead of 44 and reposted
11Dari: play this and you'll see why.
that pretty much sums it up right there
the movie rushed
looks like it
ONLY MY MOVIES SUCK.MY MOVIES SUCK!
whereas eveerything in the show, every SECOND, was incredible
HAHAHAHA silverscreen! i haven't seen this video!

Crisps?

Ahh.
11Dari: the action of the show was incredible. The live action was sloooow in its action and the acting was more fucking wooden than Pinnochio.
Maybe it's crisps blood?

6At Otakon, that is.
Currently watching Kamen Rider Kuuga
http://i.imgur.com/SFLwG.jpg
Anyone else got anything to play then?
11Avatar (movie) was good, though way too cliche.
lol
11Avatar (series) was fucking badass.
11and I keep hearing Dari's crisps.
>_>
MFW not crisps.
:P
Avatar as in the last airbender movie?
it's actually the fuel o' britan, innit
11Not the movie.
or Avatar as in very long smurfs?
Hahaha, Dman.
: )
06!pokemon
Espeon, you are a 5Spearow.
11...
silverscreen has no idea lol
or is it about robotpinkie's ignorance?
11I thought I just made myself clear on that.
yup
11Avatar (movie, with blue smurfs) was good, but cliche
ok ... no one got anything to play while we chat? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_wKEQLHhqc
11Avatar (series, with bending) was badass.
6we've all been decieved
hmm
11Airbender (movie) made me want to castrate all involved with it.
Lawl.
/me 6uses deceptive zoroark powers to be an espeon
oh you are ... JOKING
Then I gotcha.
blue Avatar was horribly boring, I wouldn't want to sit through it again.
>Implying I haven't already castrated all involved with the airbender movie
11Speaking of smurfs, that Smurf movie is gonna blow.
Nope.
smurf....MOVIE...?
I didn't like the movie Avatar much though, I mean it's... uh... pretty much one giant cliche after another.
you...you're joking me...right?
smurf movie? OHGODWHY
Very pretty, though.
ok i'll just find some sorta montage
like...they wouldn't actually do that
something like that
I GOT IT
man, 2010 was a good year for movies, but 2011 blows so far
11Yes, they're making a movie based on the 90's cartoon of The Smurfs...which is based in FUCKING NEW YORK CITY! HELLOOOOOOO!!!!
I HAVE TOO MUCH FAITH IN MANKIND FOR THERE TO BE A SMURF MOVIE
The smurf movie's SFX are so horrible,they give me nightmares.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91hi5GxmUPQ
this is an awesum animashun
11Special Effects or Sound Effects?
but... but.... Neil Patrick Harris?
Special FX,CGI,whatever.
11Special Effects for the Smurfs is great. The voice acting makes me cringe.
Yeah I did Dman.
:P
Does that not at least slightly increase the chances of the Smurfs movie being enjoyable?
well i'm gettin' tired >_<

this is the addition to the main theme they snuck into a plushie

@pony
12Barry is 7Applej8ack

ee...nah
/me 11raises his hand.
if so i have a few good vids, but if not i'll find others :P
11BRAWL! :D
W00t! are you into metagame?
not anymore, unfortunately
huh huh?
aww robotpinkie
11metagame?
hello
11what?
aftergame
finding new stuff out
11oh.
11YES!
like the techs, the DACUS
etc
WOOT
Hmm, I have brawl, but I hear the melee was th shit.
I can't find the easter egg :(
me neither, any hints?
You had to take part in my puzzle. :P
11Melee was awesome, though personally I like Brawl better.
so i'd like to post a vid then :P
yeah, the professional players went back to melee because of Brawl failing
this is the greatest set i've seen
11:P
the*
silverscreen why wub woo for being a fan and to all who like brawl: prepare to WHOA
11Brawl doesn't fail, it just has overpowered characters just like Street Fighter.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPxyBPblWYU&feature=channel_video_title
This is the best set ever
Street Fighter 3 is best Street Fighter.
Also silverscreen
well, imo a fighting game requires balance above all else
it's link v Falcon. no overpowered shiz here
if you're limiting your gameplay so extensively, your characters NEED to be refined and balanced
inb4 Link is op
No problem.
also prince - calzorz is british. can ya tell?
which is why I prefer what TF2 USED to be
(one of 2 comentators)
he mains snake
11what's wrong with TF2 now?
and Izaw is best link evar! (Izaw fanboy here lol)
TF2 used to actually be balanced and refined, whereas nowadays it's a piss-nest of hats and imbalanced items
Yeah.
brit =]

06So... would it be like Aurorespeon or something? |D
11lol, I'm way too interested in this vid in general. XD
that's good
@RobotPinkie whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?1
which set?
nah this is fun to watch
>dem jabs >50% :O
that was pretty good
this link is awesome at hovering by the edge
not sure, i might just get rainbow dash and twilight bwushabwes
oh you silly, 'if i was him'
I'm not sure if I like the RD brushable pose, but I like the Twilight Sparkle...>hasn't bought any merch yet :(
iknowthatfeelbro ;_;
I only have the McDs Applejack

12!pokemon
Umbreon, you are a 5Shuckle.
that's still awesome
I mean, part of me is like 'squee ponies' and the other half doesn't want anyone to see :D
6I
lol :D
6need to draw that
06Victory is mine
06:3c
Same here, kinda
6along with the other 30 eon ideas we've radomly spurred
eh, I don't feel that much of a craving for pony stuff
pictures on the internet are enough
I think I would want one, just to brag I had it
06EON CONCEPT DUMP
06best dump
ok not ALL
6OH GOD HERE WE GO
but easily the majority
6I'm already preparing 3 dumps from my sketchbooks that just got tossed out
11Izaw kicked Haze's ass.
'he just DI's like a pro' (Directional Influences)
its not Link's fault that his projectiles compliment his melee so well
6eon dump later this week
I'm rooting for haze
Silverscreen - this is 2nd best match now : P next match is best match
stream kinda lags for me, link won, i presume?
/me 11uses Pit and goes for an all out attack.
D:
oh god...pit
NICE TRY NICE TRY NICE TRY NICE TRY NICE TRY NICE TRY NICE TRY
so much hate
11Pitt is my favorite character.
11why the hate for Pitt?
pit is awesome, I just hate fighting him
eh i can respect that sure why not
my fav is Samus, and no, not because of the fucking charge shot :D because of the fire
11damn. Izaw is kicking ass this round.
silverscreen - he was (before not now) seen as a kid hitting puberty for voice, and spammy
11Spammy?
cuz he has the shield (durr you can grab) and he has the side b HAYIYEYA
which locks you in
but during metagame about 2 years ago
we discovered DI Directional Influence
where every hit you recieve if you tap a direction you move that way a little
11I hardley ever used the stupid shield. it left you open to physical attack.
so you can get out of pit and it's fair =] but before pit was seen as spammy
which nerfed his side b huh?
haha
oh yes
this match is GODLY
064:3!
these custom skins are awesome, did he mod or are these available somehow??
Reticentsmolder you mod
it's really easy
/me 11has seen some MLP mods to this.
you need the homebrew channel first that's what allows you to mod stuff
oh wow, Izaw is raping him
/me has about 7 MLP songs and parasprite smashball
12Hiya Espeon :3
11Epic.
I've seen a RD reskin of sonic
fighting to winter wrap up remix is pretty fun
/me 11has seen a stage redone as Cloudsdale.
or was it someone else?
11has to be Sonic.
yeah, I saw the cloudsdale one
but fighting to some legendary choir music or phantom ensemble or stuff is good too ; )
you mad haze?
11Choir music. One of Critic's top 11
yes thats y i said it ^_^
since when did nicks drop from disuse on this server
cuz u showed me that vid
:<
6since a long time ago
unless you guys want to see the end
11Izaw has an all-win streak going on here.
prediction: haze will win this one
huh, k
lol
they mentioned he was 3-1 in the series, how does Izaw match up to others?
anyone know 'pony thread simulator'?
nope
Reticentsmolder = his best is like 4th in world before, but normally not incredibly high
you're readin through /co/ threads?
and in doubles (izaw plays LOADS of doubles) he once came 2nd
elky it's a funny youtube vid
11What is the Pony THread simulator?
a funny vid
doubles, >mfw I heard this, are all the tourneys on youtube?
reticentsmolder eeyup
erry one
smashuk, smashfrance, allisbrawl. thers a ton of channels
is it a channel or you just search for it?
11Haze is winning now.
ahhh
ok um one more brawl vid only 3 mins cuz it's sick
>this legendary music
isn't this from Pirates?
i don't even know haha probably
lol watching it now
pony thread?
11that reskin. o.o
hmm
11I'm reminded of Soul Caliber. XD
oh silverscreen - theres a final destination mode where the level tilts and occasionally does a 360 xP it's a troll mod, and i trolled my friend with it
mod *
oh god what?
11nice.
yes, pony thread simulator
brawlvault.co.cc is best place...i think its .co.cc
I like how even though the game has TONS of maps, the only 2 that people like are final destination and battlefield
oh ok it isn't
http://forums.kc-mm.com/Gallery/BrawlView.php this is exact link. even if you're not able to use the stuff you can stil see the sorta thing people do
battlefield / final destination / smashville best maps rly :P
wow, he bombed himself to get higher
Dat Knee
haha yes reticentsmolder :3
he's trying to grab him so badly
yup
OOO shielded a knee
/me biting nails
/me biting nails also
oof
over 200 percent
he did good
ARGH! so close, that was great
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz5CzS1NWB8&feature=related
last brawl vid
11Izaw wins.
so how do these percents work anyway?
this one is fun to watch and only 1 match
wow, really nice
elky - higher percentage further you are launched
6So:
also every hit deals percentage
you die by falling offscreen
in any way
I should go though, I'll let you know how pony shopping goes next time.
and you can't die by hp damage? nice
I really hate what they did to mario's down B :(
Yes please robotpinkie let us know
6My cat toppled over my bottle of incense with her tail twice today, and in her alarm, she dug her claws into my skin while fleeing.

this ike is amazing, seems like captain falcon's are going down all the time :D
yes
if you play brawl - ike is slow as hell. not this one ; )
SO MANY GRABS
11Ike's way too slow for my choice to play as him.
oh yes, I'm aware, I really liked roy and I never transitioned well to ike
hmm
even though roy was a reskin haha
11I liked Roy, but I accept that he was a cheap reskin
i lold at the highest voted youtube comment
Roy was fun

/me 6shrugs.
silverscreen - i have no idea why i enjoyed it so much to be honest
Playing games for the night.
11The music was good, too...when it made sense.
Your brains. they are the most epic thing ever. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB7jSFeVz1U

SO MUCH N
yay! STEREO FROM WLS 890 CHICAGO!
03all that effort I made to use notes on my test
03completely failed
03my calculator reset itself >_>
oAo
oops
07fantastic o.o
03well, one of the apps froze and locked it up
07happened to me once
07.-.
03and every time you yank the battery out it resets the RAM
03I need to figure out how to use OmniCalc's RAM backup thing
03for silver editions only, it can suppoesdly backup the RAM every time you turn the calculator of
03*off
03so if it gets forcibly reset like that...
07omnicalc?
03yeah
03it's an addon pack that lets you do cool sutff
03*stuff
03for TI-83+ based calculators, anyway
07ah
03I would love a TI-89
03the problem with those is they actually make it really annoying to do everyday math LOL
03if you aren't using it for hardcore equations, good luck
03so I'll stick with my TI-83+ Silver Edition
07lol
07see
07I had an 89
07couldn't use it in some classes
03I remember a few kids did and they were like "HAHA LOOK I CAN DO ALL THE TEST QUESTIONS"
03XD
03see, our teachers were stupid
04drf
04you fail
04See
04You need an app that SAYS the calculator reset
04but it really DIDN'T
07wait
07can't you archive things without that app already?
or here
04no your ram clearing means your notes are wiped
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N57VrjyD_r8&NR=1
metal version
07which is why you move it to archive memory
07o.o
although, like it says in the descritpion, it sounds more punk than metal
03exactly
03you missed the point
03my teacher doesn't check our calculators or anything
03but
03I had a program FREEZE on me, and if you take the batteries out while a program is running, it resets the RAM
03for freal
03*real
03and I couldn't cause it to Err: Break on me either, LOL
03Guess that's what I get for trying to make it give me an 8-term Taylor series >_>
03WHY THE FRICK IS MY XBOX NOT CONNECTING TO THE INTERNET :@
It's a xbox?
:P
oooo
03...
Try updating your router's firmware
03making it a not static IP seems to work
XD
LOLwat
03so my question is who the FRICK took 192.168.1.169
03I assigned that to my Xbox
03>_>
That is fail
03god, if I have to go around static IP'ing every computer in the house, I will .-.
Search your network for sappers? o.o
03no
03I think it's my sister's laptop
03it happened once before
Aha
07someone or something with a dynamic IP took it lol
03hers is set to automatic but it seems to like 192.168.1.169
03why the frick would anything go that high
03it starts at 100
03I set my stuff uniquely, 142 for my desktop and 169 for my xbox, then 199 for my other computer
07I thought it was always random
03it's usually somewhat random
XD
03^
03but yeah
03usually it just uses the lowest available number
03USUALLY
03Apparently my sister's laptop likes 69'ing as much as I do
/me runs
Haha
03yep, IP conflict
03OK here's what I'm going to do since I'm too lazy to walk upstairs and tell my sister to reboot her laptop
03I'm gonna go reboot the router
03from here
03:D
03brb
I did that from my 3DS
xD

03what do you bet
Now, if only you could restart your router from CMD XD
03that in 10 seconds my sister is going to barge down here asking wtf I did
I bet
03I'll just give her laptop a static IP when she's sleepingh
03-h
03as I only have this problem when my sister uses her laptop
Turn to Comedy Central for The Daily Show. Find stupid show on.
03strange, eh?
Yeah, what OS?
XP or 7 :p
03She was in Chicago for a month, this is what I get when she comes home >:|
037...
Of course
it should be on in 20 minutes
03it's a brand new laptop, she's only had it a month

From what I've seen
03like a week before she went to Chicago
03aka Gotham City
I'm getting tired, though.
03I need to ask her if she met Batman
Pics too?
03of who :|

Not a fan of shipping.
I kept trolling my sisters/family that way, hah
As they were using the computer, I was behind them and kept restarting the rotuer
*router
So videos were a big problem :P
03speaking of which, brb, I apparently don't have my laptop set to static IP
02Forgot I had this up
6fu
6I misplaced my packing tape
07check one of your open boxes
6I found it buried under a ton of crap
6I swear i put it somewhere on the opposite end of the room
Bleck. CC is running some show involving poop.
Nasty.
Lol
/me grabs some coffee
03LOL @ this
03The Rom>Dec function converts Roman numerals into our Arabic numerals. It has one argument, a string containing Roman numerals. Valid numerals are: I,V,X,L,C,D,M
03Syntax: Rom>Dec(string)
03Returns: decimal equivalent of Roman numeral string
03That is actually kinda funny

wow. lucky you. That tropical storm don that was supposed to bring us out of this drought... didn't happen.
Sorry about your drought.
I hate droughts.
meh. I can't lie, its pretty bad, but things could always be worse.
Yeah, droughts suck. We had almost no rain through all of last month.
http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/DM_state.htm?TX,S
We don't have anything quite that bad...
100% of TX in drought. 99.85% in at least moderate drought. 75% in the highest drought category.
Fuck climate change.

Later.
hey, i heard the colbert report gave a brony shoutout tonight-- did anyone catch it?
Nope
I saw it, but didn't record it.
It was actually a couple of lines.
Then Colbert proceeded to start faking riding a horse.
http://www.tumblr.com/photo/1280/8363449477/1/tumblr_lp8tkqKbGg1qexfqe
Still, it's like "The bronies that have been pushing Colbert to do a brony segment finally got something in return"
damn. that would've been prime stream material
>squidaloo

The show will be on Comedy Central's website in a few days.

03that was fun, anyway XD
Wait, so does this mean that he himself is a brony? or was he just giving a shout out?
Just hope it isn't negative.
^
Likely a shout-out.
12so Flareon
12i got my 20 runecrafting last night
12so i got it high enough to do that quest and i beat it
Nittany_Tiger_ Ya, it seemed jokingly. (ie whipping the horse)
runecrafting
03OK WTF is my chemistry teacher doing
the skill that takes over a year to max
Oh god, there's already fanpics of him on EqD http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--o96oCEQyyo/TbvTijKfQxI/AAAAAAAAD9o/ZaltADq6Gws/s400/9108+-+crossover+parody+The_Colbert_Report.jpg
03I can't
03I can't find these equasions anywhere
03x.x
I doubt anything he did would be negative... I hope it wouldn't't be anyway.
That picture is old.
its the EQdaily banner now.
Dashite It is? Ok, good. I thought it was made just because of this
Woah, Lauren Faust already responded to his shout out
Hello!
03WTF does this question mean
Hi D_E!
Did y'all catch the show?
Watching it now
03and I'm quoting this exactly, punctuation and all
Nobody spoil the ending if you have
03my mind... wtf am I supposed to do o.o;
Rdash where's Lauren's response? DA?
I'm off to bed. I'll catch up on this tomorrow.
night :)
I'm sure Lauren's response will be posted on EqD.
Later.
It is on EqD now also
12which was why i dreaded getting it up, i've been questing and one of the quests i came across required 20 runecraftin and 25 construction when mine were currently 6 runecrafting and 21 construction
Nittany_Tiger, did you catch thebronyshow tonight?
Welp, hes gone
lol
guess not
I did not catch the show :(
THEN GO WATCH IT NOW!
OK!
12on the bright side, i finished all the novice difficulty quests today
By an odd coincidence, I just started recording the series today. It used to be recorded, but I stopped it because of us switching TV providers
o.o
lol
RDash what country are you in?
Polarfire US
ah.
Hm, someone on ponychan asked fellow bronies to ask for ponies on his new "I stand for.." section on the Super PAC website: http://colbertsuperpac.electricpulp.com/
Maybe that's why the shout out was given? Anyway's, I'm off there now to ask for a segment :3
:D
I shall join you
hmm not really sure what to say
He sure doesn't give much room to say something.
yeah.. "I stand for bronies!" is all I've got right now XD
I did that on another email address. This time I said something along the lines of "I stand for you adding a full segment to the report on My Little Pony:FIM
shit
._.
That's it
I'm moving the ZNC .-.
well The economy officially would have crashed an hour ago.

Yep
That was up within minutes of the shout out post. :p

I still like the Rainbow Dash "Cloud Computing" one. :D
<Drake> I'm angry.
Figures, I'm about to go to sleep when something like this has to happen

ju-jitsu is more useful for fighting
<~Dragoran> I need to go to taekwondo now <-- i used to take tae kwon do classes
what kind of music do you listen to?
Me?
O.O
yeah
Probably a dumb question since I don't think anyone else is around, but...
hmm I need more caffeine I'f I'm going to keep going.
I'm pretty easy going when it comes to music really. I'll listen to most things.
Me too.
I listen to everything pretty much
I have different playlists set up for things like Jazz, Classical, Rock, Techno, whatever...
heyo Umbreon~
years ago
that's cool. I should really organize mine. Believe it or not, no metter what it is, I organize songs by tempo.
Some are upbeat, some are relaxing, etc.
yeah, got to green belt with black stripe then i just kinda quit after december ;P
I can see how that might be useful.
especially when I'm driving.
XD
inb4 NS is a black belt
/me shot
Yup.
technically i still am a black belt
12o-O
as you never really lose the title
I've got a playlist that I use specifically for biking to school.
:o
i got 2nd degree when i was 14 :P
:p
but it got boring
^ thats why i left

/me is 9001th degree
/me runs
Yeah.
lmao Sneas :p
This song just came up. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqirqFJjBeE
that's cool. How long is the biking trip?
oshi-
It's about 9.5km one way.
ah.
How old do you have to be to get a driver's license up there?
16
It varies by province, but the most common age is 16. I think it was only 14 in Alberta last I checked.
hmm well I'm out of things to talk about :P

I went to see that movie just for the music...
I haven't seen it yet.
I've got most of the songs though XD
Yeah, I bought the soundtrack.
First time I listened to it was in the middle of winter. I uploaded all the songs to my MP3 player, put on my warmest clothes and just laid down in the snow on our front lawn and watch the stars. The few I can see in the city...
02*WB03(Drake03)02WB* - <Lyon> 04I hate you all
you live in a pretty urban area?
Small city, yeah.
ah.
< in the middle of nowhere
Heh.
hm
hey Drake
its nice though.
Hai Altair x3
/me snugs
/me snugs back ^^
how are you?
Very peaceful, hot as hell... but. Nothing really to stress over. Which I'm very anti-stress, so.
Tired, but good ^^, you/
?*
Nice to visit, but I don't think I could live in the middle of nowhere.
yeah. Probably why I spend so much time on the web. And I say middle of nowhere, there's my friends and a city close by, so I guess its not that nowhere-ish.
Exactly the same :P
How close by is close by?
wow, some new idiot freshmen in my school decided it'd be cool to make a Baldwin's Best FB Page, listing who they think are the hottest guys and girls, way to make our town look bad x____x
about a 20 minute drive. It depends on what you call a city.
I guess the closest city is an hour away, the closest towns are about 20 minutes each.
It's about an hour to the nearest edge of Toronto. How far the rest of it is depends on the time of day. :D
:) haha
I don't care for the larger cities. Like I said, I'm very anti-stressed. And the people there are always in a hurry, they are running right by their life and they don't even know it.
Stress is the #1 killer you know.
indirectly I guess
I'm almost a polar opposite I guess. Lack of stress bugs me. Can't get anything done that way.
XD
haha. It takes a lot to get me worked up over something. I'm very laid back.
When you get stressed time goes by faster.
and so far in my life I have found 0 things to get worried about.
life is too short to worry.
As you could guess I'm usually late wherever I go.
03http://sale.images.woot.com/Don_t_Mess_With_Me!r5sDetail.png
:D
03LOL
I'm usually on time give or take 5 minutes.
:)
1 is ok, 2 is company, 3 is lunch
that's good
xD
my lateness depends on the event
XD
Heh
stuff usually doesn't get done as fast around me either. I take lots of breaks.
:P
I take exactly one break.
o.O
It usually starts whenever the task is assigned and ends a couple hours before the deadline. :p
XD
x____x I'm so mad right now >_>
procrastination? that's a lifestyle for me. XD
03at what
well, some new idiot freshmen in my school decided it'd be cool to make a Baldwin's Best FB Page, listing who they think are the hottest guys and girls, way to make our town look bad x____x
and to make things worse, someone else started a "PPL who hate this" Kinda page aimed at the page just mentioned above
seriously, as if the rep of our town wasnt bad enough x____x
Bot of my parents are very industrious and I have a natural distaste of authority so I guess its only natural I don't get worried about stuff.
03why, you mad because you weren't one of the hottest?
/me runs'
And my grandfather died of a series of heart trouble (stress related) and I promised myself I wouldn't let that happen to me.
No.
I couldnt give a sh*t about that
what angers me is that this dumbass thinks its ok to be discriminative and decide whos hot and whos not :P
again i dont care what those idiots think of me
idiots refering to people at my school
but i just can't stand that people think this kind of Sh*te is ok
you still here?
03it totally is OK, if you're a guy looking for a hot girl :)
/me runs
:P i already have someone kthx :P
03I could say something mean
03but w/e

hmm guess not : O

iPod touch: more reliable than my PC
And I can sit on a couch and use it
drf wouldn't be so happy seeing you say dis, ae?
Yup
But I can, since he's sleeping :P
I have it and an iPad, so he doesn't let me hee
*hear the end of it xD
lol
I do have an iMac at home, and some iPods, but
It's sorta annoying to see everyone have them, ae?
I guess
I personally like them, but I wish there was some customization to them
My iPod is jailbroken, so I can install some good stuff to customize it
Desktop Macs, can't really unless you buy peripherals
Which is why I also have a PC (i'm on one now),
I have installed in my PC a BD drive and a TV capcard.
I prefer PC to Mac, but I'd like to have a newer Mac as our family computer and a better PC as my gaming compuyer
*computer
You can game on mac. Game devs are moving towwards having mac copies of games,
and for those that don't, you can download unofficial ports.

My summer is still going
Same
Hi Dashite
Hey
I'm 22
Guys, who wants to be a part of !Trivia testing?
Why does 10am feel so early? >_<
going to be 23 in October
Barry, are you me?
lol
what?
10 am? it's like 4 pm here
22, 23 in October.
It's 10:14 AM here
October 5th for me
0___0 whoa
9th
gooooooood mooooooooorneeeeeeeeeeeeng
Dman: I mean I was on a vacation trip and it ended yesterday.
Good morning? No such thing.
where'd you go?
Ah. Did you go somewhere nice?
lol dashite
I went to Point Pelee.
I might be going on a tour of the East Coast next summer
Southernmost spot in Canada.
near the coast?
visiting various landmarks and amusement parks from Florida to Maine.
Dman: nope
Dermathil: did ya go swimming at all? I love swimming during summer it's nice~
yes I did, Dman. That water was more than 80 degrees farenheit. (Dunno how hot it was in celcius, but it was the hottest non-heated water I ever swam in)
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_Pelee_National_Park
cool i see it
31 degrees Celsius
One side of the point was hot and the other's cold.
never mind
I thought you said 88
31? it's 35 here and goes to 50 (Granada, south of Spain xP )
26.67 degrees Celsius
is 80 degrees Fahrenheit.
still quite hot
Yea dermathil, but taht's still quite hot :P
I ain't got no idea how hot it actually was but it was the hottest I ever swam in.
And the waves packed quite a punch when walking in em to swim. Be careful when they reach belt height.
It hurts.
ouch
though the place was awesome. I easily swam for about a hour and a half without noticing the time passing.
=D
awesome!
I'm watching 'Limitless' right now. What are you guys up to?
Contemplating going back to sleep.
Nothing really. Just hanging around.
I'm listening to some music from the Pokemon anime
I need to stop going to bed at 4am.
Dashite - if you're tired sure do it, and Barry, that's awesome :P
The one I'm listening to now is the Regi theme
Dashite i woke up at 10am today, came online, for like 20 mins then went to bed till 12. I had an awesome ninja dream (i promise you this is true).
No ninja dream guarranteed, but sleep is good.
I'm having a bit of difficulty sleeping since my air conditioner copped out early in the Summer
And I'm living in Central Florida
: / it's hard to sleep in the hot
yeah
My ac tries to freeze me out of the basement.
Believe me, right now, I'd rather be freezing
How hot today?
I think the high is around the mid 90's
farenheit i'm guessing :P
No, it's totally celsius. :p
[sarcasmmode] no, celsius
Fahrenheit*
/me starts to listen to a song written about fallout 3 and contemplates starting to listen to it when reading FO:E from now on (yes, I caught up to the latest chapter in less than 4 days)
I'm slightly comfortable in near 212 degrees Fahrenheit
lotta reading
lol
I think it took me 2 days, but there were only 16 chapters when I started.
-1 Kelving :P
impossible
Dashite: I read all 34 chapters in under 4 days.
dashite - i've still to even begin reading, but it's in my backlog
you can't go below absolute zero
>_< That's the joke!
That's why it's absolute!
yep
want a linkie to the song?
even at absolute zero, the electrons are repelled by the protons (they attract but there's a limit and once too close the oposites actually repell!) this creates kinetic energy
[/intentionallyignoringthejoke]
0 kelvin, in theori, will never be reached

Miracle of sound's such a good musician.
Have you heard it in Cantonese before?
Yes ofc seen this very vid :3
cool
Sorry
forgot the comma
Wait a minute, he looks like he's doing that with a proper weapon. Swap it for a ladder.
Lol dashite

i guess it doestn't, but it might've helped

just blame Apple, it makes more sense :p
Only if you're a hypocrite
Then, yes
:3
how am I a hypocrite
'It's a map!'
You only think one thing is bad as hell, even if its clearly not, and say bad things about it even if you never tought twice about it, or even TRIED using it, or think about it
Makes you the dumbass in this case, think twice before hating on stuff
I have tried using Apple products
I'm an educated hater
Educated hater? I think a hater who doesnt even try thinming about things twice!
when the people at the Apple store told me you can't cancel a download on an iPad

The top comment on that video.
Heheh.
you will be assimilated.
and had to sit there waiting for it to finish so I could logout of iTunes >_>
On a ipad yes
not dr who >_< Treasure Planet
But with e newer ios5 and ipad 2, makes alot of difference, amirite?
exactly
Not Dr Who. Star Trek
no?
lol
it was the same iOS
Dashite's got it.
i've barely seen any star trek
still sucked
Ah, be back later bronies
LET'S GO! LETS GOKAIGER
but to my left on the bookshelf is all 11 movies :P
and some sort of 'borg' sniny dvd
i'm back
No, ios5 is the newer one, upgrading it makes inprovements
shiny *
I actually try their stuff so I can make a good argument as to why it's a pile of crap :P
See ya in a bit, RDash
did someone draw the ponified gokaiger yet?
And i CAN cancel downloads, if its about that one problem
I thought NewDCD posted it ages ago here
well it's also the fact that it's laggy as frick
Mmhmm, one or two flaws isnt enough to call is crap
And it isnt laggy :P
takes a whole two seconds to rotate
it was for me
That was then
and I actually tried the iPad 1
*2
still laggy as frick
Every changed, is newer, better, faster, not laggy
I never saw it
Im afraid i didn't save it and don't know the link to it
the Android tablets I tried were much less laggy and more responsive
See
plus, better hardware
no USB ports? what is that crap?
Fanboying over one thing, hatin over the other
02it takes me 8 secs to change windows in this pc, your argument is invalid :P
HYPOCRITE
02</laaate>
Ray get a new PC LOL
and um no?
I don't fanboy over Android
it has its annoyances too
Erm, everyone knows, yes
: /
OF COURSE!CyBorg!BRILLIANT!
like how I can't record phonecalls >_>
?
And still, isnt 99.99999999% opinions? Like some of your opinions make you a hypocrite
it's more the hardware I don't like
Clearly
Somepony repost that "ROW ROW FIGHT DA POWAH" vid from last night!
opinions, yes, but I don't see how you think I'm a hypocrite o.o
CyBorg because of the pronunciation on the 'CY' and the 'BORG' due to the guy exhaling so much
Think twice then
pegacorn - sure
Hay, guys. This argument is pretty pointless. :p
Why do people think you're a hypocrite...?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91hi5GxmUPQ
Erm, maybe because you go ewwwww everytime someone names apple?
they don't, you do
no?
Quite pointless if i may say so
DO THE IMPOSSIBLE SEE THE UNSEEABLE ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWER TOUCH THE UNTOUCHABLE BREAK THE UNBREAKABLE ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWER
and to be fair, Apple was good in the 80s.
And quite annoying, really
but not since then
And still is
Thanks Dman
Think about it
no.
A. Ny. Time, bro, anytime
Android and microsoft based technology on apple
...
Without apple, no android, market would collapse
Android has nothing to do with Microsoft
So if microsoft drops out
And android
And linux
it's based on Java
o.o
it's like Linux + Java
'hmmmmm delightfully tangy, yet, robust'
Mmhmm, i see, i see
Point is, people get annoyed when you go ewww about everything YOU think is assy, while its not
I didn't go ew, I just said blame Apple :P
*facepalms*
also the whole "it's not" thing is YOUR opinion, not fact
PROXYYYYYY PAWNCH!
And apple being suckish is YOUR opinion
Not fact

02I wonder if NS is reaaally here .-.

Split personality.
Wut
or whatever their official names are
Do they have official names?
Where'd that come from?
Hey.
http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Mr._and_Mrs._Cake
^ here ya go prince
Lauren Faust mentioned the names behind the scenes
'Their full names have not yet been mentioned in the show, but they've been mentioned by the show's creator, Laruen Faust'
according to her, they are Mr. Carrot Cake and Mrs. Cup Cake
yes
@pony DMan's secret lover

Lies.
There are no people here.
@pony ValtheJean
6 ValtheJean is 12Spit8f7ire
Only ponies.
ah I see
Ponies and bronies, and bronies as Ponies
and hmm...Spitfire is pretty awesome...but she isn't Caramel
I suppose if I can't be Caramel, Spitfire is acceptable :P

@pony
12Dman is 15Prince Blueb8lood

@pony ValtheJean's secret lover
6 ValtheJean's secret lover is 2The 8Wonder2bolts
0____________0

Lawl.
I'm more pimp than Bruce Mayne
Dman: I have.
Yay ~~
@pony Elision
6 Elision is 7Scoota6loo
Well, I put the Wonderbolts in separately.

That's how I've always had it. :P
eh, it's funny i guess
ValtheJean: Give me a minute.
w00t!

Caramel finally gets the respect he deserves!
@pony Elision's secret lover
6 Elision's secret lover is 5Little Strong7heart
im 0k with this
if that's fine by you
The current list is this.
Black background, you guys only see "Soar" instead of "Soarin'", I see Soarin'. :P
aunt and uncle orange? sherrif silverstar?
I figured
I was always wondering about that...
Hilight it
I think I forgot Braeburn.
Just gonna post the ones i think shud also be in then :P
cough caramel cough
I um........ totally didn't realize until just now that the colors matcched up to coat/mane/tail colors
@____________@
LOL
wat elision
lol
Aunt and Uncle Orange should be separated as Uncle Orange and Aunt Ornage
Orange*
cough colgate
so we don't pull another Mr. and Mrs. Cake or Wonderbolts thing
aunt orange. uncle orange. braeburn. sherrif silverstar. Colgate.
so far
Wat
Lily
Now to work out how to colour code all these ponies. >_> <_<
Rose
no djpon3
lol
I find your lack of Caramel disturbing O_o
Pfft, I did it ages ago. :P
wewt
I didn't check through all the characters in a list.
And add them all in.
I did all the ones I remembered at the time.
lol, there should be an entry for "The Mule"
Hahaha
>no mayor
Mayor Mare should be one
Wha? No Lyra and Bon bon? :P
wait...do we not have Derpy?
Derpy was the first one.
derpy was the first val
>_>
yes
<_<
derp
7Br8ae5b8u7r5n
..... hi dari we seem to be twins
Lrn2 CTRL F
?
hmm
weird...that's not showing for me
Don't forget Lily, Rose and the third one
can you make it split into 2 colours only?
would look nicer
02dead chat is totaly not dead
What do you mean?
oh oh oh maybe they'll believe we're not the same lurkers now
nop
nope
like so one half of text is one colour
and other half is other colour
not colours everywhere - it just feels like the pony is the word
Nurse Redheart
p-p-p-p-po-pony, pony's the word. p-p-p-p-p-po-po-ny, pony's the word
so far
Bruce Mayne! The most recent addition to fanon!
I'll try to think of more
valthejean - fanon
Don't forget Tenderheart
What, so just: 7Brae8burn
theres only a few fanon
?
But that's a good lost Dman and dari
Nup
@Dman I don't see your point
valthejean eyedunno lol
lol
other than more fanons
Lily, Rose, and Daisy
and Nurse Tenderheart
All I need to do is colour code them.
Which you guys can't do on mibbit.
so you're ok? ok ^_^
Aloe and...damn can't remember her sisters name
(i did more trivia questions today : D)
Awesome.
I think it's Aloe and Vera
like 1/2 of friendship report q's done
nah, it's not Vera
no
because I made that mistake before :P
i'll try to finish friendship report Q's tonight. meebee we can test them out xP
that would be fun
Lotus
Aloe and Lotus
5A8ce
Lotus
it's Aloe and Lotus
rainbrodash hasn't accepted me yet on skype : <
02nope.mov
Aloe and Lotus are fan names, though
lol, I didn't realize anyone here used skype
but so is DJ Pon3
DJ Pon3 isn't really.
not anymore
apparently
I'd say canon since Equestria Girls.
But it could still just be a stage name
As I've come to understand it, Vinyl Scratch is her real name, whereas DJ Pon3 is her fan name
though I could be wrong
stage name
Vinyl Scratch is just a fan name.
DJ Pon3 is pretty much canon since Equestria Girls.
Vinyl Scratch is still a fan name
As far as we know, DJ Pon3 is a stage name
Meh, DJ Pon3 probably isn't going to come back.
maybe
I'm curious which of the side characters they'll bring back in S2
I'd say it's safe to assume it's just her name.
Luna
So what's up now? what is everybrony up to?
I doubt ponies have 'stage names'. :P
She only got two lines last time
Derpy is going from animator joke to full-on background pony
well yeah, obviously Luna
but they said a lot of side characters will be coming back
and will have her derped eyes all the time
4Apple 8Bumpkin
I really hope they don't try to make her a larger role or have an episode about her as some bronies want
it'll be more of a Where's Waldo thing
that's good
>pony called Apple Cider
Wut
Ponies have alcahol?
of course, I will demand that she have a mail bag at some point :P
Is that an official name or fan name?
Cider isn't alcohol, yet
I didn't think Apple Cider was alcohol
>cider no alcahol
Wut
not*
I think cider is just unpasteurized juice
"Cider varies in alcohol content from 2% abv to 8.5% abv or more in traditional English ciders."
What are you guys talking about? LOL
that's British cider
maybe
I thought that was the cider everyone drank? :P
You guys don't drink cider?
Wuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut
but even if that's true throughout the world, it's not enough alcohol to cause any form of drunken state
02death.mp3
Of course it is... O_o
2% to 8.5% is miniscule
even kids can drink it
legally
LOL
That's completely wrong.
oh?
2L of perry is 9 units.
either way, doesn't the government realize that the only way to at least reduce the amount of underage drinking is to make ubderage drinking legal?
underage*
where did that come from?
I didn't even think it was illegal here, it's illegal for to sell alcahol to someone under 18 here.
I really went on a tangent there
-for*
But to drink it? I think it's legal as long as it's not in public.
hm
Ah, there we go.
According to some person:
"Yes. You're allowed to drink from the age of 5 supervised by a parent or guardian. The reason it's supervised is because the parents are supposed to know better and give their child a limit, they are not supposed to allow her to get wasted but it's not a legal matter if it's in their own home, it's just looked down on by society."
what do you think about the gun policy?
In the US?
yes
I don't really know anything about it.
Alright, who here is from the US?
@pony
12Barry is 7Ste6ven Mag7net
So cider is a non-alcoholic drink in the US?
LOL. Wow.
I'm not sure now
"During colonial times apple cider was consumed as the main beverage with meals because water was often unsafe for drinking. Ciderkin, a slightly alcoholic beverage made from cider pomace, could also be found on colonial tables.
Sometime after Prohibition the word cider came to mean unfiltered, unfermented apple juice. In current U.S. usage the term is used for both fresh-pressed juice and fermented products, although the latter are often called hard cider. Apple juice, meanwhile, refers to a clear, filtered, pasteurized apple product.[42]
"
According to wiki.
"The United Kingdom has the highest per capita consumption of cider, as well as the largest cider-producing companies in the world"
It's also more dangerous to drink cider instead of pasteurized juice
The greater possibility of pathogens in the drink
at least it was in the old days, not sure about in the 21 century
Oh, I'm from the US
Apple Cider is definately not alcoholic lol
I've heard of hard cider though
I can't believe you guys don't have cider.
Apple cider is alcoholic here. :P
Haha, I never knew that
Hey, RDash, what do you think of the gun policy?
>wat
it logged me out saying my name was signed out or something
Hmm, I don't really care either way, but they may as well be aloud because people can get them either way
So if it becomes illegal, which it probably wont, most likely bad intentioned people will be the only ones to have them
Mmm *real* apple cider http://www.guide4weightloss.com/images/apple-cider-vinegar.jpg
MFW apple juice, not cider
What? Apple juice is clearer
Wiki has a picture of real cider.
http://www.ayushveda.com/womens-magazine/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/apple-juice.jpg
:P
Clear apple juice.
Cloudy apple juice.
Not cider. :P
I have no idea D_man.
k
because you've never had real cider before
also whenever you name people it's impossibru to read haha
:P
Oh did you add any ponies?
Pfft, calling apple juice 'real' cider.
lol
Not many, I got kind of distracted by a pony called Apple Cider. XD

Hmm.
It doesn't tell you which names are fan names and which are canon on the wiki. >_>
<_<
sure does
the onees in blue boxes
=]
ones with blue boxes are confirmed
Ohhh.
That makes sense.
oki? :3
Apple Cider isn't an official name. XD
lol
'Official names are listed over a light blue background. ' y u no read the first line? haha
:3
'This is a list of ponies that don't appear in the characters page. Official names are listed over a light blue background. The names are mentioned in the show, Hasbro's toy line, or stated by the show's crew. The rest are given unofficial names by the fans, based on their cutie marks, behaviors, attributes and similarity to older generation ponies.'
I wonder which drink the person that named Cider is thinking of? XD
YAY
Especially around Thanksgiving
You've heard of that, right?
October
I've heard of it, yeah.
The time when you guys all eat turkies? :P
Yes! :D
12bo13on8-bon
...
>_>
Well
12bo13n-8bon
the colours are
um
So, if you've never had cider...that mean's that you've never had cider doughnuts?
That's as close as the colours gets.
get*
are you looking at the bonbon i'm looking at?
03LOL @ the post office
use white, blue and pink
^
03I go to mail that wi-fi adapter for Pattyrick
mfw exact same pic opened up in other tab xP
03and the guy's like "You know someone in the Navy?" and I was like "yeah... just curious, how long would this take to get there?" and he's like "I dunno, depends on how fast the ship's going"
03I was like LOL
I'm using blue, pink, and yellow.
Yellow is closer to the fur colour than white.
but you could use white for 2 letters, then blue 2 letters, then pink 2 letters
Or yellow blue pink
And you can't even see white unless you have a black background.
Is there a lighter yellow to choose from?
ok ok
No.
yellow blue pink
That's the only yellow.
2 letters each?
:/
I'm using the darkest blue available.
yellow BO /yellow pink N B /pink blue ON /blue
And the pink is perfect.
^ that smiley isnt even close to the text : /
Yellow pink N B?
Wut
first 2 letters yellow, next two blue, next two pink
would be sick
Hey there Sathi!

hmm
lol, I think that you're right
i love the first one prince dari, but phaps with a space in between?
8Bo12n B13on
(tell me if i'm annoying just tryin' to be helpful here:P)
I kind of prefer it without the space.
^ I like that one
hmm
Maybe a hyphen?
/me is waiting for cat pics
i'm just used to seeing space or - cuz that's the popular fandom spelling
but without space is fine
Bon-Bon

Hi
Hi barry1
Before you call be an impostor, Barry1 and Barry are one and the same
I can tell ;)
My brother's on one computer, and I forgot to log out of there, so here I am
haha, well your brother's a brony right?
anyway, what do you guys think about this story idea: We've all seen stories where Rainbow Dash has an accident and breaks one, or both wings, but what if instead of breaking a wing, it's severed?
Like in Cupcakes :O Sounds good!
It would be a training accident
yes...."accident"
^
Barry1 ;_________________________________________________________;
aniways i'm still afk rite now : P
You know it doesn't take much speed to lose a limb
50 or 60 MPH
Dman aren't you out to dinner? haha
yes my pretties....soon Caramel will be the most popular pony....just have to get rid of the contenders...
@pony
12Barry1 is 12Soar1in'
Barry1 She goes plenty fast
I know, upwards of 700 MPH at full speed
Hit a tree or a pole with a wing at that speed, the wing will come right off
whether or not it can be reattached is the question I need to answer
Yea, she goes at least 768 mph = sound barrier
@pony y secret lover
6 y secret lover is 7G5ild15a
I meant to say "My"
But when she does break it, she gains more speed
@pony My secret lover

BITCH, THE WONDERBOLTS ARE MINE

NO! I'm RDash!
They're mine
HE TOLD ME THIS MORNING
@pony ValtheJean's secret lover
6 ValtheJean's secret lover is 2Princess L10una
grr
huh
I can live with that
LOL @ the |WTFghost bit XD
though I'd prefer Caramel :P
@pony Soipony's secret lover
6 Soipony's secret lover is 5Snai10ls
yup
Caramel has no lines in the show, why you love him so much? :P
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Probably from the fics, there are hundreda
because HE'S MOTHER FUCKING CARAMEL
bad IC is one of those little issues here in Italy
actually, I never read pony fics :P
hundreds* 90% in which he's gay lol
O_o
*gasp*
you take that the FUCK back!
I don't read fics either.
but no- I work every day to try and get my interpretation of Caramel as fanon
I still know he's always shipped with Big Mac though. XD
one day Caramel...one day
DAMN YOU BRONIES.....DAMN YOUUUUUUUUUU!
Aren't Big Mac and Caramel cousins?
What is your interpretation of Caramel?
no
ohherewego.jpg :P
alrighty
so first off
I've read a few. Not a huge enthusiast though. Past Sins is great
HE DIDN'T GET A SEX CHANGE YOU COLTCUDDLERS
I know braeburn is an apple cousin
Sex change?
Wut
oh boy
okay
so
One of the pictures of Caramel is with a mare's body
watch Winter Wrap Up, pay close attention to Caramel's design
then watch Over a Barrel
basically:
there's a female pony with the exact same cutie mark/looks as Caramel
wb Rora
and thus he was known as sex-change pony
THESE ARE LIES
Oh.
SPREAD BY CARAMEL HATERS
IT'S HIS TWIN SISTER
(only now realized that I am bat-shit insane)
but yes...back to Caramel
so: now that we've established he's a twin
I like to think his last name is Cake (Caramel Cake). The forsaken child of Mr. and Mrs. Cake
basically, since his cutie mark is three horseshoes (which I interpret as blacksmithing) he's been disowned by his parents
nice backstory
:P
lol
but there's more!
so his sister
06Roarawr
why does she have the same cutie mark?
http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110630190056/mlp/images/4/45/Female_caramel.png
well, I'm reminded of a particular comic (wish I weren't on my work machine so I could link it)
basically, female caramel comes in and starts flirting with Big Mac, talking about "the operation"
said joke causes Big Mac to faint, and then Male Caramel gets angry at female caramel
and thus the idea was born:
she is a complete troll
who enjoys nothing more than trolling her poor twin brother
!Espeon
/me now belongs to Aurora for 6 minutes
04Eons
thus the cutie mark: representative of her first time impersonating Caramel :P
Lageons
eh
Lolnice
For reference: http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/photos/images/original/000/128/606/df12dd5855e0ff85c371b556f7672007.jpg?1306808676
yes! that's it!
You are now 20% cooler RDash :P
:D
and then one final bit that I wish to push on the fandom:
So Caramel is one of the boys who pulls the carriage in best night ever
INB4 I ruin your stor with:
"Caramel's cutie mark isn't the three horseshoes. If you look closely when he's walking with Big Mac in Winter Wrap Up you can see what looks like the top of a caramel apple on his flank above his bag."
:P
story*
O_o
pics or it didn't happen
http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSaUnAzCW0r3vihBXojE2cVNryZZfcNUf3HMKsxbdFrddR2LRy5
grr, Inbe4 DAT LINK
that
fuck
THAT'S JUST SYRUP
WHICH HIS SISTER THREW AT HIM
SHE'S SUCH A TROLL
Lol
although: http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTkUeUXZsRCkrlXhytpLQjnd0rOnf46ZY6Vz1dOte3P1MFg4oZn
that's my explanation and I'm sticking to it :P
03god, editing music can be annoying sometimes
That may be a fan pic though
no, that's in the episode
03only some of the songs have radio versions
it's just another animator inconsistency
hmm
since he's ALWAYS (except for that one instance) had horshoes
horseshoes*
oh yeah, also
his sister lost the grass-seeds
he just took the blame
>visitor woman asks to use laptop >opens new tab >WHEN DONE CLOSES WHOLE BROWSAR >8^(
because he's ballin
what valthejean?
:P
His sister lost em, he just took the rap because he's mother fucking Caramel
What whlalt what?
Are you writing this fic?
a fanfic? or somehting?
well, no
oh it is a fanfic?
I want it to be fanon :P
but I hate fanfics
INB4 ValtheJean actually loves caramac:
lol
so I'm working on a comic
hey hey! fuck you! :P
<3
Eheheh.
Caramac is amazing
Where does Big Mac come into this? Aint Caramel without Mac (If you know what I mean) hah
O_o
homicidal urges....rising...
LOL
lol
but as for fanfics, nah I hate fanfics
I *am* trying to get a comic series done
but...stupid work demands
I still don't get why Caramel. :P
too bad
BECAUSE HE'S MOTHER FUCKING CARAMEL

04*flop*
04I have defined it for you
What about the non-viewers?
Dman Thanks, I remember seeing it, but I cant find it. I'll be a looking
03so in other words Splash 'attack'?
in plush definition, it means that it can't hold its shape entirely
Well...tehfoxxy's trolling was probably not I good idea in the end
lol, if you find it lemme know :P
OH MY GOD DID YOU SEE THAT SEASON 2 SNEEK PEAK ON EQD?!
03LOL what
some plushes hold their shape even against gravity
OH MY GOD YES
12look at Espeons dA avi and you'll find out :3
06so it just
06and what
06that really doesn't make much sense
but till you tell me it is
like a dog plush that isn't flop style, its legs are stiff even if you hold it upsidedown
IT'S TOTALLY TWILIGHT READING A BOOK
i'm not gonna touch those numbers
:P
SPOILER: TWILIGHT STILL LIKES BOOKS!
A BOOK
HECK YEAH
03oh
