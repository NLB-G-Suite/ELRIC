That's something to do, but it is pretty darn boring
: /
I'm just waiting for an opportunity to get leverage.
I can probably spend more time tomorrow on here
What's the problem?
We have a router
i have a laptop
it detects the router wirelessly
*Warns Sky that she hasn't had her V8 yet and she's a slap away from needing one*
getting information from WLAN_blahblah
and then after like 20 seconds of this
'windows was unable to connect to this network'
Have fun hating me for no reason =D
Now, if i connect my laptop, like right now, via ethernet it owrks
thing is my room's on the other side of the house
How I wireless has?
also, other wireless networks I try give me the 'password:'
message
but MY one just goes 'getting info' then 'unable'
: /
ofc i've looked online, but the solutions are 'reset pc/roouter' done that
Other online solutions are 'derp enable discovery' which ofc i have enabled
i had this problem like a few months ago at a friends house
Have you tried wireless on that laptop before?
Has it ever worked?
02<random> A psychic once told me that I'm psychic. </random>
yes for 2 years in .... 11 networks
just checked
06o.o
i only had this problem once before, and after much 'disable wireless card enable wireless card' it worked
Have you tried removing the password on then network to see if that makes any difference?
i guess i could try that
I'M BAAAAAAAAAACK!
Are you using wireless zero configuration?
Or some other wireless client?
services.msc
i'm just using my wireless card
/me sits all over Espeon
Scroll down and check wireless zero conifugration to see if it's running.

Apple do do touch-screen laptops, don't they?
Or is that just other people?
11Only after people bitched about the Ipad.
Oh.

11I want to do a Siskel and Ebert esque review.
11Of a movie
oh oh! Can I join? Can I be Ebert? :D
11lol, Val
Lets see...if I am in texas and it starts at 9 eastern....
It should start at either 7 or 8 for me
me neither dman
Am I right about that?
cool
i see
Is Central time zone one or two hours different from eastern?
I can't say I agreed with them all the time, but they definitely presented movies well
11Yes, Ebert's the one with the bad jaw.
lol dari, clearly you've never seen Zero Punctuation :P
well, you can be good at analyzing a work...
11Dari: yes, but the thing is that they cross-examined each other's reviews, making it much more entertaining to watch them.
it goes Eastern, Central, Mountain, Pacific
it's easy to say things are "good", but it's very hard to present WHY
Well...then I have an HOUR AND 40 minutes
from East to West
I fucked my timezones up

11Yes, but this one's been updated. The audio's been fixed and one or two clips changed.
dat xmen theme
I think in the recent Xmen film Mystique (sp?) becoming evil was really poorly done.
I didn't even realize they MADE another
Nicely done
Latest X-men movie.
It's about Xavier and Lensher before they went their separate ways
I thought it was just a prequel?
hmmm
I could be wrong then
It details events earlier than have been seen before.

what's next, a Clue movie?
11Elky: Yes.
lol
AAAAAAGGGH
the Clue movie was fucking brilliant
they...WHAT???
A-whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
lol
Baww
?
why
:(
Why the aliens? Always that aliens...
oh god...Indiana Jones...
the*
que the South Park "They're raping him" scene
aliens are a pretty good plot device
02I'm sucking badly at games today ._.
Not that ValtheJean!Please not that!
02Everything from Taiko to N+
lol
11Aliens are WAAAAY too overused nowadays.
you gotta admit, that episode was hillarious
maybe, yes
11I mean, Cowboys and Aliens looks okay, but that's because IT HAS SUBSTANCE! IT HAS PLOT!
good movie? HAVE SOME FREE ALIENS
It really doesn't.
11it doesn't?
11well..
11still...
11It looks good.
It's entertaining enough.
Hmm...
I hears Cowboys and Aliens was okay
@tiredmeter Dman

@ValtheJean:Actually,i thought that episode was tasteless.
Hmm...
denied_existence do you have any huggable :3 pics of Luna?
Let me see...
Well, there are varying degrees of shit...
I have some on my iPhone, let me get them
ty
@ValtheJean:I did watch other episodes before it,namely the WoW episode and "Good times with Weapons".
11Video games on the other hand...no point.
11Video games are just interactive movies on their own.
Resi evil 1 wasn't bad
but wasn't at all like the videogame
2 and 3 are awful
lol, Dman, sorry but I hated the RE1 movies...well, all of them
movie(
jeez...my grammar today
4 is also awful, but fun to watch
The Doom movie!
@ValtheJean:Eeyup,to each his own.
lol
I just don't think movies based on games should exist
How do I put up a picture from my computer?
The only good part of that movie was the FPS section.
they just shouldn't
two completely different mediums, not meant to interact
Of course.
those are even worse
sadly yes
i say sadly because spiderman 2 was amazing
Have you played any of those licensed games?
suddenly it sucks now don't it?
and yeah, I've played several of the licensed games
hahaha
it's a joke
o.o
11I know, I was explaining it to Barry.
didn't they make a mortal kombat movie at one point?
I think there's a trope for that
11Val: Yes.
yea
lol, the Street Fighter movie? was it as bad as Mortal Kombat?
They made 3 MK movies I think.
or something
O_o
THREE?
Fanboys...I am disappoint
I liked the first one
I saw the first one
11The MK movie was...okay. It was at least watchable. The second MK movie was fucking stupid. The third I never saw.
Anyway, since we were talking about aliens earlier.

11Dari: play this and you'll see why.
that pretty much sums it up right there
the movie rushed

12.-.
>CRISPS
Crisps?

11I thought I just made myself clear on that.
yup
11Avatar (movie, with blue smurfs) was good, but cliche
6we've all been decieved
hmm
11Airbender (movie) made me want to castrate all involved with it.
Lawl.
/me 6uses deceptive zoroark powers to be an espeon
oh you are ... JOKING
Then I gotcha.
blue Avatar was horribly boring, I wouldn't want to sit through it again.
>Implying I haven't already castrated all involved with the airbender movie
11Speaking of smurfs, that Smurf movie is gonna blow.
smurf....MOVIE...?
you...you're joking me...right?
smurf movie? OHGODWHY
Very pretty, though.
ok i'll just find some sorta montage
like...they wouldn't actually do that
something like that

11Special Effects or Sound Effects?
Special FX,CGI,whatever.
11Special Effects for the Smurfs is great. The voice acting makes me cringe.
Yeah I did Dman.

Does that not at least slightly increase the chances of the Smurfs movie being enjoyable?

03OK I'm fairly annoyed right now LOL
03completely failed
03my calculator reset itself >_>
oAo
oops
07fantastic o.o
03well, one of the apps froze and locked it up
07happened to me once
07.-.
03and every time you yank the battery out it resets the RAM
03I need to figure out how to use OmniCalc's RAM backup thing
03*off
07omnicalc?
03yeah
03it's an addon pack that lets you do cool sutff
03*stuff
03for TI-83+ based calculators, anyway
07ah
03if you aren't using it for hardcore equations, good luck
07lol
07see
07I had an 89
07couldn't use it in some classes
03XD
03see, our teachers were stupid
04drf
04you fail
04See
04You need an app that SAYS the calculator reset
04but it really DIDN'T
07wait
07can't you archive things without that app already?
or here
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N57VrjyD_r8&NR=1
metal version
07which is why you move it to archive memory
07o.o
03exactly
03Chimera
03you missed the point
03my teacher doesn't check our calculators or anything
03but
03I had a program FREEZE on me, and if you take the batteries out while a program is running, it resets the RAM
03for freal
03*real
03and I couldn't cause it to Err: Break on me either, LOL
It's a xbox?
:P

Aha

03why the frick would anything go that high
03it starts at 100
03most devices are like 100-110 >_>
07I thought it was always random
03it's usually somewhat random
Most of my devices do .001 to .010

Ouch
It's pretty hot. Hottest summer I can remember.
We had a couple weeks of that this summer. It's been around 28 for the past week though.
Average temps have been around 5-7 degrees F hotter than average.
eugh
14 day trent looks like it's hovering around 26C for the next two weeks.
Later SilverMane.
It reached 90F today. Also rained.
I hate droughts.
meh. I can't lie, its pretty bad, but things could always be worse.

We don't have anything quite that bad...
100% of TX in drought. 99.85% in at least moderate drought. 75% in the highest drought category.

How close by is close by?
I guess the closest city is an hour away, the closest towns are about 20 minutes each.
It's about an hour to the nearest edge of Toronto. How far the rest of it is depends on the time of day. :D

My summer is still going
Same
Hey
I'm 22
going to be 23 in October
Barry, are you me?
lol
10 am? it's like 4 pm here
22, 23 in October.
It's 10:14 AM here
October 5th for me
0___0 whoa
9th
gooooooood mooooooooorneeeeeeeeeeeeng
Dman: I mean I was on a vacation trip and it ended yesterday.
where'd you go?
I went to Point Pelee.
I might be going on a tour of the East Coast next summer
near the coast?
visiting various landmarks and amusement parks from Florida to Maine.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_Pelee_National_Park
cool i see it
31 degrees Celsius
One side of the point was hot and the other's cold.
never mind
I thought you said 88
31? it's 35 here and goes to 50 (Granada, south of Spain xP )
26.67 degrees Celsius
is 80 degrees Fahrenheit.
still quite hot
Dman: everything is cooler in America than in Europe due to the Gulf Stream.
I ain't got no idea how hot it actually was but it was the hottest I ever swam in.
And the waves packed quite a punch when walking in em to swim. Be careful when they reach belt height.
It hurts.
ouch
though the place was awesome. I easily swam for about a hour and a half without noticing the time passing.
=D
awesome!
Contemplating going back to sleep.
Nothing really. Just hanging around.
The one I'm listening to now is the Regi theme
And I'm living in Central Florida
: / it's hard to sleep in the hot
yeah
My ac tries to freeze me out of the basement.
Believe me, right now, I'd rather be freezing
How hot today?
I think the high is around the mid 90's
farenheit i'm guessing :P
No, it's totally celsius. :p
[sarcasmmode] no, celsius
Fahrenheit*
I'm slightly comfortable in near 212 degrees Fahrenheit
lotta reading
lol

Barry: he meant he saw it subbed, and in cantonese
cuz i meant i saw it subbed english, voice in cantonese
>Oliver Piers Kenneth Edy

Only if you're a hypocrite
Then, yes
:3
how am I a hypocrite
'It's a map!'
I have tried using Apple products
when the people at the Apple store told me you can't cancel a download on an iPad
I was like FAIL
Heheh.
On a ipad yes
exactly
no?
lol
it was the same iOS
Dashite's got it.
i've barely seen any star trek
still sucked
LET'S GO! LETS GOKAIGER
but to my left on the bookshelf is all 11 movies :P
and some sort of 'borg' sniny dvd
i'm back
No, ios5 is the newer one, upgrading it makes inprovements
did someone draw the ponified gokaiger yet?
And i CAN cancel downloads, if its about that one problem
well it's also the fact that it's laggy as frick
Mmhmm, one or two flaws isnt enough to call is crap
And it isnt laggy :P
takes a whole two seconds to rotate
it was for me
That was then
and I actually tried the iPad 1
*2
still laggy as frick
I never saw it
the Android tablets I tried were much less laggy and more responsive

it's more the hardware I don't like
Clearly
opinions, yes, but I don't see how you think I'm a hypocrite o.o
Think twice then
Hay, guys. This argument is pretty pointless. :p
Why do people think you're a hypocrite...?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91hi5GxmUPQ
Erm, maybe because you go ewwwww everytime someone names apple?
they don't, you do
no?
DO THE IMPOSSIBLE SEE THE UNSEEABLE ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWER TOUCH THE UNTOUCHABLE BREAK THE UNBREAKABLE ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWER
and to be fair, Apple was good in the 80s.
And quite annoying, really
but not since then
And still is
Thanks Dman
Think about it
no.
...
Without apple, no android, market would collapse
And android
it's based on Java
o.o
'hmmmmm delightfully tangy, yet, robust'
Mmhmm, i see, i see
Point is, people get annoyed when you go ewww about everything YOU think is assy, while its not
I didn't go ew, I just said blame Apple :P

And add them all in.
I did all the ones I remembered at the time.

stage name
maybe
I'm curious which of the side characters they'll bring back in S2
I'd say it's safe to assume it's just her name.

>pony called Apple Cider
Wut
Ponies have alcahol?
Cider isn't alcohol, yet
I didn't think Apple Cider was alcohol
>cider no alcahol
Wut
not*
I think cider is just unpasteurized juice
"Cider varies in alcohol content from 2% abv to 8.5% abv or more in traditional English ciders."
maybe
I thought that was the cider everyone drank? :P
You guys don't drink cider?
Wuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut
02death.mp3
Of course it is... O_o
2% to 8.5% is miniscule
even kids can drink it
legally
LOL
That's completely wrong.
oh?
2L of perry is 9 units.
either way, doesn't the government realize that the only way to at least reduce the amount of underage drinking is to make ubderage drinking legal?
underage*
where did that come from?
I didn't even think it was illegal here, it's illegal for to sell alcahol to someone under 18 here.
I really went on a tangent there
-for*
But to drink it? I think it's legal as long as it's not in public.
hm
According to some person:
In the US?
yes
I don't really know anything about it.
@pony
12Barry is 7Ste6ven Mag7net
LOL. Wow.
I'm not sure now
"
According to wiki.
"The United Kingdom has the highest per capita consumption of cider, as well as the largest cider-producing companies in the world"
It's also more dangerous to drink cider instead of pasteurized juice
The greater possibility of pathogens in the drink
Oh, I'm from the US
Apple Cider is definately not alcoholic lol
I've heard of hard cider though
I can't believe you guys don't have cider.
Apple cider is alcoholic here. :P
Haha, I never knew that
>wat
Hey D_man, Americans don't have cider. O_______o
it logged me out saying my name was signed out or something
Hmm, I don't really care either way, but they may as well be aloud because people can get them either way
Mmm *real* apple cider http://www.guide4weightloss.com/images/apple-cider-vinegar.jpg
MFW apple juice, not cider
Wiki has a picture of real cider.
http://www.ayushveda.com/womens-magazine/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/apple-juice.jpg
:P
Clear apple juice.
Cloudy apple juice.
Not cider. :P
I have no idea D_man.

because you've never had real cider before
also whenever you name people it's impossibru to read haha

04*flop*
04I have defined it for you
Dman Thanks, I remember seeing it, but I cant find it. I'll be a looking
03so in other words Splash 'attack'?
in plush definition, it means that it can't hold its shape entirely
lol, if you find it lemme know :P
12look at Espeons dA avi and you'll find out :3
06so it just
06that really doesn't make much sense

IT'S TOTALLY TWILIGHT READING A BOOK
i'm not gonna touch those numbers
:P
A BOOK
HECK YEAH
03oh
Not even a code.
06and floppy basically means it ends up laying all relaxed and
06flopped
OHMIGAWD
Try and work it out anyway though.

03I'd probably choose a different word for it, but k
think about an espeon without a skeleton |D

well, there are some good fanfics
03:)
A while ago.
HOW
xD
I dunno, as long as it's good fanfic...
/me thinks of starting up FO:NV
Fanfics run the gamut.

Fanfiction is the main output of fantoms.

Fandoms
Hiiiigh end
03Isn't that only like two away from the top one?
Derpy was nothing to do with fanfics. :/
sigh
but phantoms too
Yes
there's a difference between fanfics and fanon
036970 was like $100 more though
03and honestly
03the performance increase is not worth it
Overclock plz?
Yeah
03LOL
03well
DO IT
XD
03I'll stick to NVIDIA for actual gaming
