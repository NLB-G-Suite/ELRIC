OMG
03but just saying "it sucks" is not.
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL

SUCKS IS NOT A SWEAR
BUT THAT
10Sigh. All you guys never do anything but fight eachother.
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
IS A <censored> SWEAR
and
DID YOU SAY FLOOF
ooi
o.o
03LOL
o_o
Omg
oAo
ovo

please?
03o_O
Whut
anyway
Hawk
le poof
drf

Frak
03sure looked like it to me
Why isn't frak censored?
do you mean, Fracture?
No, frak
03eXAKR, because it's not in the list of banned words?
FRAK
xD
Oh
by the way
Frak means fuc-
/me shot
LOL
that is my bouncer.
03bouncers != server
03s
Bounce.
uh
a bouncer runs off a server
LOL
03but I'm talking about nest here.
03would go down like twice a week LOL
I'm still listening to Nyan Cat
No...
...
it's running just fine.
it was-
LOL
03Arti herself said it was hosted using wireless
seriously
03she did
lol.
03:P
With Intel Xeon processors
Other window for a min please?
16 GB of RAM
03LOL WTF Xeon
server-grade fans
03why Xeon?
Other window? o.o
03I could build Arti a server... but why would I want to?
I'll explain something to you
03I already offered to let Arti take ownership of the server I bought that runs island
03so >_>
Because you would lose dictatorship of TST?
03no>?
03kindly explain how I have a dictatorship when I don't abuse my power?
Hmmm.
03the only times I even use /kill is if someone asks me to
You ew too much
That is all
anyway
he could, but he doesn't.
03implying I can't do that on any ordinary server I'm not in charge of o_O
Look! 5th gen Pokémon and Apple products!
03junh1024-XD, that's exactly my point.
oho lol
You ew too much. Back to you
03you just said the same thing again
03I could repeat myself too but that's lame
That is MY point
03I've been doing that for years. Long before I got island.
You make people uninvited.
That.
!ew everything
03I've been doing that for years. Long before I got island.
06EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW EVERYTHING
03I've been doing that for years. Long before I got island.
03I've been doing that for years. Long before I got island.
03I've been doing that for years. Long before I got island.
03I've been doing that for years. Long before I got island.
You make people leave TST
03as for that, that's you triggering my script -_-
You make people leave TST
You make people leave TST
You make people leave TST
You make people leave TST
You make people leave TST
You make people leave TST
03which, again, brings me back to my point of HOW DOES THAT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH ME HOSTING A SERVER
Because
03.....
03me not having a server != me not being here
Sorry I don't make sense right now because nyan cat.
But you having a server here = you must be here
...
03Everyone is childish in their own ways. Can we agree to that?
03<eXAKR> But you having a server here = you must be here <- also, no... my connection dies all the time, the server's hosted in a datacenter somewhere.
03I'm here by choice.
derp
Okay, bye!
04hi
/me hugs back
04Your like my friend at school
04she comes up to me and randomly hugs me.
04She's also like, 2 feet shorter than me. It's amusing.
._.
because of that?
and on another random note
04Awesome
I mean tbqh
04Who now?
/me shot
I don't understand all the hate
but you know me
I'm kinda fucked up
>reminiscence
>TCTL
04Because people die
lolwut.
04That's one simple thing.
:(
I'm fucked up
but yeah, you know that I'm like that
lol the crap that just went on. mfw.
I have
hm
and I know some things disgust me
but that doesn't make those things wrong
04To me, killing is wrong. Pure and simple.
04I know that there's no 'right and wrong' in the world, but that's my right and wrong.
I never said it was right
I just said it wasn't wrong either
personally, I don't really believe there's that much of a "right" and "wrong" with things
it's all opinion really
04Yes
now that's just retarded.
Anyway
04k
starving and I want to eat food
04XD
04I can eat it at my desk
04it's awesome
EWWWWWWWWW
Choices are:-
Sexual health
Drugs & binge drinking
Parent-teen communication
Eating & diet
Depression
seminar SHIT
we have a seminar thing at school next week
04What is this?
those are the topics
04oh
04um
sexual health?
/me hides
04XD
>internet safety
when they try to teach me about "not getting corrupted"
04loooool
mfw I'm already corrupted, fuckers
SUCK ON IT
derp
04Nah
04do sexual health
but it'd be boring
yeah
04"Impress" them
I'll do sexual health
lmaaaaaaaao
04We never did that in PDHP
why do we need to learn
how to put condoms on penises?
we're fucking girls
don't have penises
04XD
04It's kind of straightforward anyway
are our husbands retarded enough to NOT know how to put on a condom?
or at least admit they don't
04Unless there's this weird mechanic it has just to make it difficult
04XD
deeeeeeerp
anyway
mum's yelling etc.

04...Another thing we share in common
derp
04except it's not my 'free' time I spend daydreaming
I hope that you're not as fucked up as me
okay
I do too
XD
04I doubt I'm that much like you.
of course
else you'd be retarded
04XD
but yes
Reminiscence and TCTL are basically results of daydreams + philosophies
04I figured
derp
Reminiscence's key theme is freedom
TCTL's is right and wrong
and also evil/good
04Alot of my stories relay my feelings and opinions.
although personally, I don't believe in evil
yeah
04CoE is more about how you shouldn't let beuocracy/politics or religion rule you.
04beurocracy*
lol politics.
lol religion.
heh
DoI is somewhat similar to Reminiscence then
and CoE is more like TCTL
04There are other underlying themes, but those two are the main ones.
derp
although
tbqh
TCTL has a shitload of themes
the main ones are right and wrong/good and bad
not sure if you even read it/noticed it
but derp
04I read it sometimes.
04Hmm
04The prequel to DoI doesn't really have a theme now that I think about it
heh
tbqh I still like TMoaTB
TMoaTB's theme is something like
04What would it's theme be anyway?
loyalty and independence or something

because Nightshadow wants to be her own self
and such
and loyalty/friendship
etc.
04eh
04maybe
04never put too much thought into TMoaTB
wttttttttttttttf
lolwut
04I'm getting a real nakama sense between Seran and the DM's, the Kommander and The Hensh
04but a close bond
lmao
Seran, the DMs, Kommander Kulesz and The Hensh are pretty close, yeah
up*
-_-
04eX dies alot.
derp
well
04Rathicus and Dragoran are very complex. You also seem to enjoy having a stern but understanding leader + a sarcastic second-in-command.
TCTL is more black/white than Reminiscence
derp
Dragoran isn't really sarcastic
04Rathicus and Dragoran = The Kommander and the Hensh
lmao
Dragoran is more...playful and joking around
04Also
sort of
he does get offended easily, amirite?
and he's not like The Hensh, right?
04Sort of.
is he like the Hensh?
04Only when about topics he doesn't understand (such as, everything)

04No, not that level
04He's not constantly sarcastic
oic
well The Hensh isn't always sarcastic
derp
he's just impossible
seriously
well then that sort of makes sense
not really
XD
04He's basically a living weapon with alot of poetic skill.
ooookay
04I make my characters too sarcastic
do you mean "get offended/take it seriously"
when you say "literally"
I just disconnected
04Not 'get offended', like the phrase "It's raining cats and dogs" he'll go "No it's not, it's just water."
and nah
it takes quite a lot to get me mad
04Yep
04Although noobs get on her nerves.
04So very much.
04Keep them away.
well
it doesn't really make that much sense
but it could
if his personality is like that
04hmm
04Because by then he'll know alot more and he'll be more comfortable.
derp
but like
Rathicus is sort of like Kommander Kulesz I guess
but Dragoran isn't really like The Hensh
Dragoran isn't sarcastic
There's also a third person along with Rathicus and Dragoran though (not Syril)
She's revealed in chapter 9
04Seraph or something...
04what's with the ':x
04we all were
I was
04I kind of was

Kommander Kulesz
lmao
I remember that
12eep
lmao
eh doesn't afraid of anything
04We don't see much of him though
really?
04lolthat was my intention XD
lmao
his motives aren't really clear until you read the prequel
04exactly
04It's frustrating
lmao
And well
derp
I'll explain that later
in the fic
and lol
coming to...THE HENSH.
04THE HENSH
9,1THE HENSH
04"Cower in fear O' yee mortals! The time of reckoning has come!"
lmao
then Rex says something.
and then The Hensh is like
xD
04KK or Dyan
04HMM
LOL
Let's write that
LET'S DO IT.
04XD
04LET'S DO EET
You can write Dyan
I'll write KK
04right after I finish this drawing
fine
04Gotta do this for some friends at school
04they need two of my characters to model
lol.
well like
lmao
We should write KK and Dyan

04Nah

04now THAT would be awesome
Espen?

OH
OKAY
04and awesome
COMMENCE THE MIND GAMES.

why osama bin laden is hated
12what D:
12k
12!pokemon

12wb
Thanks
wb
ty etc
because seriously, he can't be that bad lol
killing != end of the world
though it could very well be lol
12!pokemon
okay but just ignore me
I'm extremely fcked up etc.
12it's a topic i refuse to get into
I'll probably grow up to be a terrorist too /sarcasm
no but seriously
I don't understand
12google it
I read something that said australians wouldn't really understand until planes crashed into the opera house etc.
but tbqh I wouldn't give a damn.
actually I'd probably be like "yay" because that thing is retarded
12how would you feel if planes crashed into Drake's house?
trying to imagine that.
if he doesn't die I'd be okay with it I guess
if he does die...idk
12exactly, a lot of people have killed but he killed tons of people
I see
right
well
I'd probably bawwwwwww all over it for a while
but I wouldn't hold an overall grudge

but then again, there's no one IRL that I care for enough for that
12drake probably isn't even that close of a relationship either
12people lost family members in 9/11
the only person I'd consider somewhat close would be the Hensh
eh family members
12mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters
I care for my friends
>family
okay, bye
12anyway like i said before, it's not a situation i want to get much into
eh tbqh I've been waiting for that
derp
well
I'm not exactly the most caring person on the planet lol
in fact, I'm probably quite far from that
hm
let me think
would I have enough time to be like "holy crap" or something?
aka would the plane kill me? derp
then I probably wouldn't feel anything
12i had a feeling you'd say that
pretty much
but derp
12kind of hard to do that when you're buried under 20 feet of destroyed building
I don't feel sorry for people that much lol
but while you're alive
you can
even if you physically can't

12you have sort of gotten into the habit of relying on yourself, but some people literally use other people like crutches

Exterminating

well
I can understand that
lmao
Yes, exterminating it with heat

12you aren't exterminating it with heat

12only evaporating it
it's only now that I even have someone to turn to IRL
but
12you should open up more :)
it's people like all you
...such a shame there aren't that many to open up to
Oh wait
12all i can really say is old habits die hard
is opening up to all you not enough? lmao
;p
12when you open up more, people start to understand you more.
not everyone.
and lol
12exceptions are everywhere

uh lol
I don't want people feeling sorry for me
and nearly every time I've trusted someone and opened up
they've gone around spreading it f*cking everywhere
which is even worse
12Thomas Edison failed more than 1,000 times when
12trying to create the light bulb". (The story is often told as 5,000
12or 10,000 times depending on the version.) When asked about it,
12Edison allegedly said, "I have not failed 1,000 times. I have
12successfully discovered 1,000 ways to NOT make a light bulb."
lol that quote
12lol
that quote actually makes sense to me :/
12psychology is usually tricky
I prefer
heh, depens
12then again it has been a subject that has interested me in years
12what?
Jean-Paul Sartre
eh?
psychology != physics/science
i see :P
psychology is the study of the mind or something
I forgot
my bad, and i know
and tbqh
Man is condemned to be free; because once thrown into the world, he is responsible for everything he does.
i thought Umbre meant something completely different, referring to the Edison Quote

Nick: 4chan
13If you watch it you're likely to be brainwashed

03yeah, seriously, real pros resist the influence :P
pfff, that isn't THAT hard.....is it?
03no I haven't
in a nutshell
03I refuse to watch it for that reason
03generally speaking, if something is uber popular, it sucks
03and there are very few exceptions to that
transformers, ghostbusters...
/me runs
03more or less
well I'm sort of the opposite, if there's something I like, I want to see it do well
03ah well
03if I like something, and then it becomes popular, that's fine
03but I don't want to start liking something because everyone else does
yeah i like things if they have merit to be liked, not "hay evryone plyas it"
03^
13But meh, I'm not addicted/obsessed or anything, I just like it
same here angel espy

03and wondered why on earth people would like MY LITTLE PONY, of all the shows
03then I watched it

03Yeah

also, > assuming people have apt-get
derp
no they don't.
or at least the popular ones do
or yum
far from all.
apt-get is to be found in Ubuntu and other Debian-based systems.
or the other package installer stuffs
debian is awesome though derp
/me uses Arch.
redhat/centos/etc uses yum
I haven't used Archlinux
that makes my package manager pacman.
none.
Arch comes without a graphical environment.
you put whatever you want on it.
Arch comes with just the most basic requirements to run.
I use Awesome with Xfce/gtk apps.
xfce lol
heh
at least it doesn't use KDE
or Unity for that matter
You could throw KDE on it
Archlinux makes me think of freebsd though, as that doesn't have a GUI
there probably is a Unity package by now.
unity is retarded
you can put just about whatever on Arch.
I never heard of people using KDE with Arch
but there are packages for it.
that's one of the reasons I like Arch
it comes with nothing, thus no crap.
this is how my screen looked a lil' while ago, showing only irc: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5525458/2011-03-05_irssi.png
also, me prodding my IRC bot's code: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5525458/2011-03-09_minnet.png

04You hug me alot lately

yeah
because I want to visit you
12
12 updates for my laptop.
derp
146 packages can be updated.
97 updates are security updates.
too lazy to run updates
there's no such thing as a security update here.. all updates are software updates of one kind or another.
Ew kernels ;p
04XD
04So you can hug me?
/me hides
well, ubuntu is crap
...wow. 2.6.24 was some time ago.
And you call that a desktop XD
now downloading 2.6.38.6 :p
it's just not cluttered like most people seem to like them.
Not compatible
pretty much
I never got to hug you last time
it's a place for a wallpaper and some stats.

"I KNOW RELIGIOUS DEBATES AREN'T ALLOWED ON THE FORUM BUT I'M GOING TO START ONE ANYWAYS"

Like here's one
http://www.spyroforum.com/post-346189.html#346189
wow that's pointless
then here used to be a post saying "don't abuse the word filter" with a quote with the filtered word in it
http://www.spyroforum.com/post-344035.html#344035
oh hey one more post and I'll be at 50

I just broke 4000 on SF
I dunno
RDX ended up doing the rankings
I SHALL FIND OUT :D
and he spelled "Rhynoc" wrong

omg yeah that bugged me alot
I dunno, he's just... never been this annoying
off topic, and I apologize, but I am still a dragonfly :(

03there's a 5.5?
there's a 5.5!
03wtf does it do?
Nothing?
12what the heck
12firefox wasn't my default web browser?
12when did that happen
hurr
A4, AE 5.5, IS/ID 5.5, AX
etcetc
o,o
03I have AX from standalone, but there's an A4?
you got short-term memory ploblem?
03I haven't seen it
thats tr00
do you need to edit in surround?
03I thought A3 did that?
its easier in A4, since its inline, not simulated.
03eh
03so should I get rid of all this CS5 crap I just installed and install CS5.5?
when you mixdown it is genuine surround, but its just nonintuitive not being able to work in native surround, thats all
up2u, some apps weren't updated.
03well does the CS5.5 master suite include Acrobat and Audition?
03as those two I had to do separately with 5
>master
it does now, since A4 is CS.
AX releases are often separate from CS.
*new
A3 wasn't in CS.
03wait
03oh
*AX releases schedule is separate from CS.

03since I already have AX I'll just leave CS5 alone
03sorta
which ones?
03because with Acrobat 9, it kept erroring when I tried to open PDFs inside my browser
oh?
03yeah
03and I had 9
03and both did that
i herd you liek memory hogs and memory leaks
and a bazillion toolbars

Yup

;p
one, two, skip a few, ninety-nine, a bazillion.
How many buttons can you see :o
03uh huh
just like you hijacked that counting thread on TST
i can do it too, right?
Surewhynot?
How many MBs/

03around that
it has DXD logo?
or a whatlogo?
DxD
03Disney Channel logo.
03I don't have DXD in HD yet
03actually
03I might have it next week
we have it in HD already
hmm, ntx then & internets
03nickstr, I have cable
not that it really matters
WOW or UMICH?
;o
03yeah it's 433MB
03junh1024-XD, bayleef.
03nickstr, it matters to me since you can't direct stream copy record satellite :P
03so cable FTW
03http://bayleef.hoshinet.org/~drf/Shaun%20the%20Sheep%20-%20Zebra%20Ducks%20of%20the%20Serengeti.ts
you still get it from satellites
03orly
that is how the "cable" channels backhaul signals
yes you can
with special tuner cards
you can do it with KIDS & WOWOW, not?
Heya Credit
03I mean American satellite.
> with special tuner cards < i can buy one for DVB_S in NZ
oh?
Dish Network and DirecTV use DVB-S
inb4: indirectV
03yes but encrypted
I can recall seeing it on early receivers from both providers
03so not next week
03http://content.wowway.com/documents/WOWWAY/PDFs/Cable/DTA/MichiganTransition.pdf
03and Starz usually doesn't upscale. :P
you are forgetting something else
03hm?
03I said DIRECT STREAM COPY
I does not effing matter
03doing that is recompressing already compressed material
03and component doesn't do 5.1 audio :P
03I just have a CableCard from my provider, I pay like $3 a month for it
03and get everything
03none of this tier BS
meh
cab;e
*cable
03the cable system here is really good
pay through the roof for less
03and you might be pleased that they're getting rid of analog next week
03I'm kinda annoyed as the two CRTs we have in our house now need special settop boxes >_>
03but that's what's allowing them to add like 50 more HD channels
or M6
not 6
bundle 6 and 7
not 5 and 6
03there IS a movie 4 and 5 bundle DVD
03and it has movie 4 in widescreen :P
SD
03yes SD, but widescreen
03anamorphic
03Heroes is still crap
I am moving over to HD and would prefer HD over SD
03as much as I agree iwth you that pre-AG > AG, movie 7 is my second favorite.
the masters that most TV stations get for M4 aren't HD. Haven't seen any.
M5, however, was HD in JAPAn, i think
03junh1024-XD, Starz is special
M5 US, unsure/
03I mean, there is *no* existing rip *anywhere* of the movie Hollywood Homicide in anything above DVD resolution
03but it aired on Starz HD in proper HD
03I have 4 separate TSes of it
03that I'm gonna try to delogo
03nickstr, it'll probably be one idsc
03*cisc
03*DISC
03with the movie 4 and 5, it's a flippie
03double sided disc
two would make the most sense
best quality
tr00
squeaksqueak
hi Sneas
if its one disc then NO SALE
hi
03so if the Blu-Ray is anything like the movie 4/5 combo DVD by the same studio, it'll be a double-sided disc, one movie on each side.

I have 3 main ones atm

04I have a couple I haven't actually put into words at all
same
04There's that psychic one, the mercenary one, a sci-fi one...
derp
04also the one from the dream I had last night
04which was weird yet inspiring
I have a shitload of dreams
see
Reminiscence was inspired by a dream
Actually, it was Seran's Story specifically
04XD
well
merged it with my school project thing
XD
04Alot of my stories are born from stealing off other franchises.

TCTL was inspired while I was in china last year
basically I was thinking of being kidnapped/having terrorists on the plane

finally got through the ANNOYING process of recompiling all of islands modules
now that's awesome.
believe it or not that's not a vhost
Testgeddon is connecting from *@tintower.ho-ohrealm.net 64.37.49.99

finaaaaaaaally works
it's reverse dns
!dns tintower.ho-ohrealm.net

!dns 64.37.49.99
Resolved 64.37.49.99 to: tintower.ho-ohrealm.net
:D
instead of a normal IP or ISP/server provider hostname
it's a reverse DNS*
ahh
[22:37:43] Testgeddon is Testgeddon@tintower.ho-ohrealm.net * Testgeddon
[22:37:43] Testgeddon is using modes +iw
[22:37:43] Testgeddon is connecting from *@tintower.ho-ohrealm.net 64.37.49.99
the "is connecting from" bit is the user's real IP

asking her to change the DNS entry of tst.lugia.us or add the island.lugia.us DNS
to 67.21.84.209
Baw
How am I supposed to remember that?
yeah it's hard to remember
hopefully she'll add the DNS entries
or I'll make one off my own domains
finally got reverse DNSes for tintower
<3
Does it still haver +1337 ;p
yeah
Good
nothing has changed except for the IP
Such a shame :<

13brought my food with me
06OR tell her in a way that she simply can't misunderstand and give her "motivation" to think through her actions next time?
06And that means quite a bit coming from me. But "Without notification" is a bit wrong :P
6I dunno about un-misunderstanding from Haii, though.
04http://www.sonicretro.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/classicDerp2ReturnOfTheDerp.png
04|D
/me runs
06I have a rather strange stance on things anyway
06But oh well
6Well, about the 'without notification' part:
6I feel if we say to Haii if she'll get un-banned shortly, she'll just wait it out impatiently.
0610xPost wtf
6We've noticed. :P
06And yeah, but still - "No notification" just leads to MAD and confusion
6But she can't do anything about it, right? :P
13Honestly, I don't think she even knows she's doing anything wrong, no matter how many times you warn her
13:|
12lmfao "And I can't forget you, NightSeas!" in that post

03Whoa what's wrong with her o_o
6I can guess someone (tried to) explain to her?
03@ the thread
6I'd say tweenage moodage.
6Well, how's this; have the community criticize her.
12I think haii has some sort of disorder
6Perhaps she doesn't act different because she isn't getting any response (well, not much, mine is rather advanced for her) from other people.
06"rather advanced for her"
06wtf is that even supposed to mean?
6Un-understandable.
6For a person her age.
06Maybe it's an idea to "dumb" it down a bit then? :P
6I did.

who's Haii

6"She" referring to Haii.
oh
10More than just one punishment, forgot to add "one"
6http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=6994.0
6For one.
6Ah.
10Meaning, she needs to be banned for at least a week or two
6She asks of Haii's age.
6Haii's in 7th grade.
12So she says
10I'll notify her of that
LMFAO ARTY!
12I think she's in 3rd grade if you ask me XD
OWNED!
6I dunno, she told her school to the forums.
6And it's real school.
uh oh
at least lots of them don't have mIRC
10I recall that, which thread was it?
6Hmm, let me check:
GTG going to town
12I think it was in her old signature, I might be wrong though
6Hey, Arti.
6You know we've got a situation.
12Oh?
12Thanks!
okay I guess I'm not going to town yet
6Well, you know Haii's behavior.
hey Arty Chan
how have you been all this time?
12Yeh apparently she's 13 O_____o
o_O
12^v^
02Hi arti~
heh
6Well, I gave ideas to the IRC on how to respond to Haii.
12I've been very busy as well, lol
LOL you totally owned Haii with that message
12Which one..?
/me is amused by everything going on
that one
i agree
6I don't think we all feel that, right?

I'm too lazy to click
12http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=6994.msg265160#new
12There's a direct link
i see
6Wait, what'd Rora do?
12I think she banned Haii then unbanned her a while later
6Did she notify Haii she would be un-banned?
12Can't remember
13OT but
13xxLatiosxx is coming on soon
13:3
12Yay
13ohai :P
6Mmm'kay.
6Well, back on topic:
6If Haii's under the idea she's been permanently banned from TST, then she'll think about her actions rather than wait for her un-ban.
12I personally think she'll go on a rage about how TST sucks etc. but I guess that's pretty normal.
06Oh hi
I just want upload a pic
6Hmm...
6Oh, hey, xxLatiosxx.
6Well, from my experience, it works. :P
/me pokes xxLatiosxx
12xxLatiosxx :D
02Hi~
hi
03Moo
6But I'm not as... expressive as Haii might be.
06And I'd expect an account like HaiiTheReshiram2 or something and/or lots of upset messages anywhere they possibly can be sent, but that's just me again :P
o.o wow hey xxLatiosxx long time xD

Was it the butler?
hmm?
I swear, it's always the butler.
apparently I accidentally turned off my wireless somehow =/

I guess it's not the butler then
Well, the butler has to get his kicks somehow.
(:
I think you put something in our meal this evening.
That's one way of putting it.
for me at least
yeah, I figured that could be a coincidence
That explains the Java problem.
:P
oh yeah, I suppose
Daaaamn, I'm good.
XD
...
let's hope it's the ?in most cases? one
Common causes of this problem
Large file transfers from secondary media, such as an external hard drive, to a local hard drive.
Loss of power to a hard disk drive that causes inconsistent data sectors.
Hard disk-intensive processes such as antivirus scanners.
Recently installed hardware that might have compatibility and performance problems.
*"in most cases"
Nowhere does it say "Annoying audio loops on ponychan"
that makes it sound like it may have to do with the AVG update
*that in
I only updated AVG on my other computer

today meaning earlier
yous?
This questionnaire is completely filled with stupid questions
There's one that asks about how tactful you are
"How many items have you stolen from target in the past?"
"How many do you plan on stealing while employed here?"
lol
why do they even bother asking that?
*typical
I would sue and say its discrimination!

12to an extent

watcha reading?
and against percentages!
Maybe that could pay for my tuition instead of working
hahaha
12so i took them to this place that exchanges books for credit and with the credit i bought like half the animorph series
Oh, now it wants to know about my grades in high school
12which was all the copies they had
12not counting doubles
you dont trust them all but you dont think everything they say are lies
yeah
12i already am half way into #1
you should scan that application id like to see it
Pretty much asking for people to lie
but they are coming here soon i hear.
hmhmm
haha
12blah
I've filled out this application at least twice
and I've never been hired there
"YOU IDIOT THEY ARE OVER THERE ARE YOU BLIND?"
probably being too honest
ive only ever applied to work at one place
and we didnt do a written application, just an interview
I've filled out tons of applications and only ever had two interviews
one of which I was hired for

12It is common for people to experience pleasurable and even euphoriant effects from eating capsaicin-flavored foods. Folklore among self-described "chiliheads" attributes this to pain-stimulated release of endorphins, a different mechanism from the local receptor overload that makes capsaicin effective as a topical analgesic. In support of this theory, there is some evidence that the effect can be blocked by naloxone and other compounds that

plus you gain nothing from hyper threading
03I just put it in the socket
03that's all
it's called turning off a BIOS setting. its completely safe.
if anything you LOSE performance
it just how the OS manages & sees the CPU. thats all.
03I like having hyperthreading.
03also wtf, since when do i3s hyperthread
since 2009
If it's the "if it crashes it only crashes to 12.5%" "reason", thats the lamest excuse, and it's not as beneficial as you think.
if you can give me a sensible reason, fine
03that it's my CPU and I don't feel like modifying settings?
03I'd be more interested in a setting that makes eSATA actually work
03as right now it doesn't
03even though I have it in AHCi mode
that excuse is lame
that "12.5%" really IS 25%

12there is no such thing as a utopia
12an
12even though they are corrupted
I can't say it because of the epic failure that is +G
12lol
12the pattern i have seen
12is the more people become aware of a community, the more it falls
I actually fought long and hard to keep +G from being set on another forum's IRC channel
12o-o
yes
12so people aren't allowed to swear and swearing is met with negative reinforcement
the overzealous op's script automatically kicked people when they cursed
which resulted in kicks being a regular thing
yes
the curse filter is highly flawed
12i don't think i ever seen that happen here
it happened quite a bit
they do make mistakes
and they do end up with false matches
12it's only common sense
12computers are a creation of man
12which we ourselves are flawed
plus you have to live with the fact that cursing is everywhere
especially in this day and age
12cursing is everywhere
12but that doesn't mean it should be invited with open warms
12"oh swearing happens everywhere, okay swear as much as you want"
I am not saying to invite it
I am saying that you should live with the fact that it exists
12i know it exists
12a person at my bus stop for school used to swear ever 5 seconds
12it drove me nuts
plus the way I see it if you don't drop the F bomb all the time then its tolerable
12i completely agree in front of the right audience
12it's nothing but an empty word then
and I refuse to say that
12?
because it just seems childish
12what does?
calling cursing "swearing"
12sigh

He never cleans the dishes well, leaving food bits stuck everywhere <<

He shoots back with, "then why I don't get it?"
(Major ew, I know)
._____________________________________________________________________________.
o.ô
His body probably had all sorts of resistances to bacteria that could send me into agony
It's disgusting, his lifestyle
He never seemed to depart from the ways of village living
o.o
hmm
I have mostly given up
I have learned to work around his ways, mostly
hehe xD
but for cooking instruments I leave it to him, since I trust the heat to kill the bacteria
Next time I'm doing the dishes myself though
Well, he uses too little of it <<
Damn my ISP hates BitTorrent

Go HD monitors

03you just set the resolution properly :P
O.o

Which is why I have a 2nd monitor that is only 17in and 5:4 XD
that's why i wouldn't like a hueg monitor

04Oh wow.
04That is, the sprites themselves, including transparency.
0.o
And that means
04nope
04Those are the size of the images
04the sprites themselves might be that size, but the sprites are actually a bunch of seperated parts.
Haha
04All animated seperately.
Doing the old SNES trick
16 bit to be less nintendoy
04It works ;P
Oh
Just tons of sprites
04And the only thing that involves 16 is the sprite palletes.
04Seriously
O>o
Does the SNES have more ;P
04I mean, those 16 colors can be any colors at all, but still
04only 16 colors per sprite.
04kinda
Amazing that the sprites look good
Imagine..8bit colour sprites
Now those would be nice
6The sprites themselves are really getting lower quality. :/
04Hur
04not exactly
Kinda
04It was the animation that killed it
But the animation
Agreeded
Lol
6No, not the animation.
04The quality was nice
04yes
6The SHADING. :U
04o-o
Shading O.o
04oh
6Reshiram has, like, only 5 colors in it.
04um
04no
04wait
04haha
04It uses 12
04out of 16
04XD
04Guess you're right, then.
04wait no four
046 colors make up its WHITENESS
04huh?
6The sprites are animated, though most uploaders only show the primary panel or the whole animation.
04http://www.spriters-resource.com/ds/pokemonblackwhite/reshiramani.png
6O_o
6Long animation...?
10...
04yep
Hai Sky
04And those can have seperate timeframes.

Morrowind
noo
OH
A mod?
not at all
oooo
From the past
the terrain is from the mod project I work on
o
ooooo
I approve!
the main game's land can be seen in the far distance
:o
I should play that.
this is the city down below http://img146.imageshack.us/img146/9812/mgescreenshot6.jpg
I need a long period of time where I can sit down and do nothing but Morrowind, though!
and this is the ash swamp down at the bottom http://img827.imageshack.us/img827/1286/mgescreenshot22.jpg
er
mmmmmmmmmm
I mean be less bad
<.<
the combat isn't that bad is it?
It's awful
The screenshots are not, though~
!
yeah, the wonders of the Morrowind Graphics Extender :p
back from a friends house
ate all his food
like we do at all of our friends houses :D
I took this one http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9897526/MGE%20Screenshot%2067%20%282%29.jpg
Cool!
pound cake....<3
because of the repetative combat
I always tend to play mages
oh yes
XD
tough the rpg is awesome itself
it's not that it was repetitive
which are slightly less repetitive
the combat etc is very dull
it's just plain horrible
Well, I suppose you do do nothing but spam left click
same for the magic effects
but I never get very high level
I think highest I ever got was like 22
all the way trough
/me 7shrugs. :/
nothing else really
I like exploring
7I wish DreamMagma was here.
I'd tell you but I sold my wii XD;
best I can say is go to wii settings, it's in there
which is why I like the mod I work on (Tamriel Rebuilt)
7Natu spins around and around. O.o
the name is something of a Misnomer as we're only working on getting the mainland of Morrowind in
but it's still a heck of a lot of extra terrain, interiors and quests
Hurry up and do everywhere else!
I'm pretty sure we're intending to only do Morrowind
other projects have taken up the mantle for other provinces
Hurry up and do everywhere else!
04Dammit
I should totally do a livestream of me doing some CS work at some point
that kind of thing is possible, right?

Even though we can't fly by ourselves, our highly intelligent minds can build things to solve all kinds of problems.
For example, as I said before we can't fly by ourselves.
Goldfish probably think they're intelligent, too.

Goldfish actually have slightly longer memory than that.
I heard the same, but it's actually a few minutes I think
I can look it up
Forgive me for using Wikipedia, but here's something on it

you use joomla too?!
i have it fo my dad's his sites ;.;
TST uses joomla too lol
ew.....
lol
and joomla can be the most annoying thing ever
when used correctly
12It's the best CMS.
12TST used to be Phpnuke
12now THAAAT was bad
phpnuke
12and wordpress is more limitede.
12-e
mfw
wordpress is crap
12Whats mfw?

<- never paid for anything
technically you could code the website by hand and do with that
but when you need to update menus etc.
12Yeh that's just it, I'd rather have all my content managed
yeah...i need to update my menus! let's go through 60+ HTML pages to change it!
Oh no, I typoed! Let's go through it again!
/me Now Playing: PokéRemixStudio - Pokémon R/S/E: Legendary Trio Remix 2

12Where there's always SSI or Php include but it's still a pain XD
but that requires effort
12yeh
/me hides
or time....
and there's always the possibility of more bugs
i normaly update my dad's site once a month, if joomla does co-operate.....
i know.....
/me whistles
however, it's not the most newbie-friendly software ever
12Phpnuke is I think
on the song.
12But it's Sooooooooooooo buggy!
phpnuke has more bugs
than my garden does
andand the themes suck too.

Saw that
You know, everytime I look at my Reshiram plush, I think
03wow, even with the brightness at only 25%, this is like overwhelming
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_browsers#Vulnerabilities <---
03eh, don't think that's entirely accurate
User interface?
03Opera... takes a lot longer to load anything for me
"supposed"
And it isn't ;D
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/46872/info
OK guys
Which do you choose?
/me hides behind flame-proof shields
Pro blem?
I'm torn between these three
03Firefox
Don't baww
extensions don't work everywhere, like gestures
03and Opera is just too f'ing slow
Pfft ;p
03it's quite bloatware
03@ Opera
03LOL
Haha
Chrome's UI is strange
03IE is actually not that bad >_> <_><
03*<_<
Opera is a bit bloated, yeah, but I disable most of the features I never use
I know
03I need to fix this tag.
I know
Ellen McLain
ellen mclain
03ah thanks
Yeah
Just get chromme
03there, that should do
And stop bawwing about the GUI
Or just use the extension that makes it look like IE :P
Yeah, I have it
03pix or gtfo
And lets it use Ie's tools/functions
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fnfnbeppfinmnjnjhedifcfllpcfgeea
LOL drf saying pix for a program and not for a girls bewbvs
bewbs*
03>As if they would ever support the competition
03uh'
03HML
031. That still has that annoyingly huge color bar at the top
03and 2. It seems more like IETab to me
03as in
03which... defeats the purpose
03just go use IE
XD
IE9 interface
Chrome's speed
Yeah?
03IE9 :/
Firefox's flexibility
03They ruined it
038 was the best one IMHO
Opera's tightness
Ie9 was a letdown, sorta
03yep
That
That'
kjbes
THAT IS WHEN eveyone loves eachother
There should be a web browser with all of that
Then we won't have to choose
Oh?
Which isn't going to happen ;P
03yeah
03he wants to use Firefox's backend to make an entirely different browser
03with no bloat and whatnot
Nice
03LOL
I hate all of FF's interface ;p
Can't remember it's name
its *
03<usotsuki[evilmachines]> lmao
03<usotsuki[evilmachines]> actually, at this point I'm tempted to gut Gecko altogether and try to fix up the Arora browser.
i.e. a web browser with a WPF interface

:P
*your
You still haven't watched the others?
The people are disappoint
sorry the people
and that vote is necessary!
okay fine
I'll do it
one episode a night until I've seen them all
:P
Maybe
worth a shot I suppose
doubt it
Nyan can't even measure up to such campaign promises
I bet the reaction would be lulz-worthy.
lol
Well, I don't know about SR
but he doesn't /seem/ like he'd be one
NEVER KNOW
maybe he is
That would be hillarious.
you're visiting ponychan and he says something that gives him away
you reply "is that you SR?"
"Uhhhhhh... I have to go"
It's not me
I posted once on ponychan
was it Stormytrooper?
I think it was someone else.
Lawl.
haha
XDDDD
that would give it away
LOL
:P
mine would be a TIE fighter
or an Indiana Jones hat'
RDX's would be the Coke logo
XD
dari's is a monocle
Yeah. XD
because I just know this
it actually is a monocle?
XD
lolno
nah, I made that up
Also, have you seen this GIF before? http://arch.413chan.net/Apple_Bloom_-_Cutie_Mark-(n1297311330037).gif
Aristeo's would be a female elf
that's epic
ahh, scary
I think that was her name.
Sapphire Shores is? o.O
wouldn't hers be like music notes or something?
Yeah, if you look she doesn't have one.

haha yeah
