lmao
03but that still takes effort
03I'm sure there's a way to crack activation on Vista/7
03but I don't see a point given that I can just abuse the phone system
03it still falls for "yes it's only on 1 PC"
lmaaaao
03well, XP does that too
03I don't use the activation crack on my real machines
03I just phone it
03but for VMs, I'm lazy and just crack it
This is why I use MSDNA keys
woo
03well
03considering I've made and deleted about 10 XP VMs today alone
03I'd run out of keys
03:P
rofl
They are not multiple activation keys?
03one time use
03they're retail keys.
lawl
03TechNet works 10 times
03but that's still only 10 times, not infinite
03well
03they work infinitely on that one machine...
WBV29-DP2KM-MKTXM-CTCDB-MCJ28
u jelly?
03XP?
I have one thats thousands of activations or something
yeah
03I have a Win7 enterprise
03that works for 500
or
03this dude I know on IRC actually stole it from his work, right
03that key is blacklisted now
03but a key I got off some random chinese forum isn't
TBTDF-AMQGH-66MW7-X929V-8KHG0
03it prolly wosn't work

03I'm debating between that french one or hentzer
03or w/e
hetzner's expensive though
03yeah
03wait
as for the french one
you need to check
whether they accept international transactions
lmao
03I think we have a couple on hoshient

03I'd totally get this Hetzner server but it's really fricking expensive
drfffffffffff help
03I have no idea :/
have a look anyway?
03it doesn't give any errors or anything?
They are actually pretty cheap
03well
As far as dedi go
03¬Ä50 a month
03is way over my budget
03even 30 was pushing it
it doesn't give errors at all drf
03well that server is way overkill
it just does the "steam is loading game" thing
03I only need like 2GB of RAM, not 16
03hm
Pick a random old dedi from there auction site
03those are still fairly expensive though
some for 30euros afaik
volumedrive.com
urgh
I tried
hm
gfx card?
If it doesnt say, left click on the exe and properties
uh
let me find it first
Steam\steamapps\common
doesn't say any version
Properties on the exe, and the details tab?
03hm yeah the cheapest ones that would even work have 2x300GB HDD and are like ¬Ä32
I tried
03LOL
03consoles jsut work :P
Download and install the dx9 redistro
yeah
the fawk
the sdk is 500mb
/me just looks for the dll

yeah I found that already
Just use that
03hm
100mb? o_O
03Operating system: Delivered in Rescue System <- does that mean I can install whatever I wsant?
03*want
Yes
03nice
03I mean I suppose that's not too terrible
03it's like ¬Ä32 or 33
03still expensive x.x
03anyway brb, need to reboot
k
dedi's are expensive
indeeed
inded
urgh
can't type
yaaaay it works
First thing todo on a win vista or 7 install is to install the dx9 redistro
As ms doesnt bundle all the dlls

hi pancake
How are you?
i'm ok
Well, it makes little sense
yes it is
Hmm
only because
it was open book
:P
excuses
to be honest
because the book stinks
it doesn't get to the point and strays around the corner
it's not concise enough
Go in depth
but you should take it step by step
:p

A group‚Äôs scope refers to the types of domain controllers present in the environment.
T or F
i got that wrong
is it T?
:o
:<
i answered T
false again?
correct
LOL
set up the groups first
then add users
it depends -.-
:p
you need to add accounts before anything else
Effective permissions are determined by the cumulative share and security permissions, not the cumulative share and cumulative security permissions evaluated individually.
and of course i got lost in the wording of that statement
O.o
well
;<
I bet it is false
:P
no
it's false
LOL
well the wording
see
stupid teacher :P
wtf are they asking
LOL
sorry with the multiple choice portion
CULMAgtIVIErjgfjdnf
i don't have access to all the choices given
:<
NTFS permissions can be set at which of the following? (choose the best answer)
i answered partition level and apparently that was wrong
i think the other choices was file level
directory level
and share level
file level
makes sense
But
Share evel maybe
though
NTFS is a file system
you can set folder permissions
file permissions
not a blasted type of permission
lOL
No
When a user accesses a file locally, and there are both NTFS and share permissions on the file, which permissions are actually used?
permissions FOR the file system
:p
UHwaut
Uh, I suppose the network permission?
I guess ovo
now you know why he irritates me?
Why?
:<

7I've planned my CPAC team since... well, since the last one ended. XD

i've played the TCG for 6-7 years
maybe more (i've lost track)

59 decks
40% of them was won by one deck
7 of them were won by decks that are meant to beat that deck
or 11%
51% of the format revolves around one deck in otherwords
7Centralization. O.o
yes
one deck takes hold of the format
and you either play that deck
or play something that beats it
7Doesn't sound very creative. X3
exactly
80% of the players were playing the same deck
7o.O
7X.x
i'm getting sick of this pattern
7There's slightly more variety in VGCs. :)
skarmbliss PO server
i think it's 22% or something
7You're using none of them?
i'm sure that in those 22% of the matches
most of them weren't the same exact team
7Hence the difference in percentages.
they aren't doing anything to fix the format either
the next set is going to be an expansive set
02oh, you mean skarmbliss stall?

12*?
03no>?
03AFAIK"
12probably
03it's like Rapunzel on crack
12what issue do you have in that?
12...
03my main issue with that is that it's an animated movie made since about 10 years ago that isn't DreamWorks or Pixar
03:P
03I mean, it's not like I'm just refusing to watch movies and going "gee, I don't have any movies to watch"
03I still have tons
03:P
12I know you do
12but you can't see the forest for the trees
03I should prolly watch 8 Mile next xD

03I am still looping Battle Metal (piano cover)
:p
03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_AdgnAMKxU
03it's originally a metal song with lots of screaming
03but that cover is awesome
Can I have it too?
:P
And
I need that KEEN.ZIP again ;-;
though
hmm\
Yeah, I'll need it
03WHich keen games
034-6?
03or all of them
none of them
:)
I'm excited
03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ift85e38H3M
i'm going to regionals
03the actual music is nice but I hate the vocals x.x
and going to fail miserably
but i'm learning more and more tools to make team building amazine
amazing
03LOL wtf is it with metal bands and dressing like creeps
you mean like kiss?
lol
03it seems like a lot of these guys paint their faces all weird
hey
03Turisas apparently does that too
metal had to start someplace
all music came from the classics
:D
03bands like Bon Jovi are cool, they don't need to dress up :P
he's in a league of his own
4-6 plz
03that actually install
03if you want them
035, I don't own sadly :(
Aww
03well
But okay
13yarrr
03I can get you the pre-installed one
03or
Well
03there's this one site that has all the floppy disk images
I'd like to try to install them into DOSbox :P
as I doubt they'll work in CMD prompt/windows
03they would
03if it's x86
03but you won't have sound
03and the music is the best part of those games, IMO
okay
03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVDeFOmuMtA
03this one is one of my favorites
03I swear the name isn't supposed to sound dirty
lol my teacher
03it was 1991, LOL
03http://www.sendspace.com/file/dx2dq7
03those are ripped from my legit floppy disks
http://www.laughbreak.com/quotes/weird_al_q_a.html
03the installer is a bit annoying though
i don't know which quote to use drf XD
03I'm like... "why can't you just fully copy each one?"
wow
03I assume you know how to use floppy disk images in DOSBox?

Stupid DosBox
03also OMG
It doesn't support multi-floppy images
03I might block that silly image soon x.x
03um
03you can't just manually change it?
03mount the first one, when it asks you to change it just replace that with the second
03o.o
o.o
okaay
03I don't really know how dosbox works tbh.
I'll try doing 1 at a time
but
03you can get Keen 1-5 for $5
03total
03and that includes dosbox and all that
03b ut I was a bit annoyed at no Keen 6
03as that's one of the best 3 :/
03I hate the first 3 games, sure they were revolutionary but it's more like NES than SNES and the stupid sound effects are annoying

Granted the music for them was fun and enjoyable.
03yeah, but it's just not the same if you play SNES games on mute
03well
03you can't NOT like the music :P
DUDE, SMB WAS BEST
03but the Keen games, honestly, were revolutionary in terms of music for their day.
Still is
/me dies
03*Them
03but the first 3 Keen games had no music, only PC-speaker sound effects, it's basically...like listening to a dial-up modem while playing x.x
6hiiiii <3
hullo
03for which systemsa?
03-a
SNES
03most NES games had music
03erm
03SNES, even
03but what's amazing
03is Keen 1-3 were 1990
03and 4-6 were 1991
03Keen 4-6 had twice the resolution, actual music... etc
03in juts one year
03*just
03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkZQsKTSsHY
03makes my ears hurt
03compare it to
03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESYfhiHc0Vw
03Just one year later
03that's why I prefer 4-6
with dosbox
03over the first 3 :P
I thought I installed
but it does nothing
it doesn't even ask me for disk 2
03did you run install.bat?
yeah
03I know
03but my point being
It said "Done"
03XD
XD
03plus, I grew up playing 5 and 6
03er
It made a directory too
03*4 and 6
03I didn't even know about 1-3
03as they don't actually use the numbers
03it wasn't until much later I realized there were more.
Despite them being like
6-18 months apart.
Finally done with homework!
I mean
Hi
lol
I never did homework XD
03oh, and it's a Seagate too, this is expected
SeagateL
XD
03-_-
03The computer isn't recognizing it at all
03:/
Y u buy seagate?
03I didn't.
03it's LaCie
oh
03but they happen to use Seagate
03:/
But I haven't had a problem at all
XD
Depends
I have an old 40GB Seagate HDD
03yeah, OLD
03but ever since like 2005
03they suck
03erm, OK
2 or 3 years, I dunno, can't rememeber when I bought it.
03if OK means "I know this drive is going to break and am just waiting for that day" then sure
Like every HDD
They all die eventually.
03WDs tend to last longer though
03and less random dying at a very early stage
03like this one which I literally ust got 2 hours ago.
03*just
^
03well
oh?
03I just plugged it into one of the university computers
03that runs XP
03sigh
03frick
03Amazon is out of stock
03so they can't give me a replacement
03x.x
oh hi
03XP doesn't care, meaning you can have XP on a dying drive and it won't know
03:P
OS*
/me shrugs
03Just for kicks I installed XP on it
03didn't care at all
03I wouldn't have known and it woulda just died one day
03:P
03but instead I got a replacement since it was still under warranty
XP is pro, doesn't care about anything 8D
03IDE drives don't self-monitor
03So starting with Vista, it included the SATA/SMART drivers and would actually check
Basically microsofts way of saying they want more money :P
03it just tells you there's a problem with it
03weird
03for me it did
03has it?
03or rather
03wtf?
Hmm, both standardised in the same year
Well
03but I don;'t think the motherboard knew how to handle it
http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/disk_smart_view.html
IDE/SATA disk.
03Hardware details:
032x HDD 320 GB SATA
032x RAM 1024 MB DDR-400
03AMD Athlon 64 3700+
03Setup (once): 32.00 ¬Ä
03Price (monthly): 32.00 ¬Ä
Its cheap fore sure
Its not going to be a powerhouse though
03well yeah
03I'd prefer 4GB of RAM, but for some reason those ones are like ¬Ä45 a month or more
03which is a bit much of a price hike for 2GB of RAM...
03not sure why they're tiered like that
03literally exact same CPU and HDDs, just more RAM
actually afternoon..
03yes
03all of them are, unless you wanna pay ¬Ä60+ a month
dedi's are expensive, however you cut it
03those ones literally cost more than the EX servers
03https://robot.your-server.de/order/market/sortcol/hd/sorttype/down/page/2
03I'm looking at the 2x320GB ones
03since oddly they're the same price as the 2x300GB
02Well, Nini everyone~
Theres some x2's with hwr for 38euro
03really?
03oh yeah
03I see those
03well
pair of 320's though
03when they say hardware RAID, do they let you pick the config?
03as I'd rather just not have RAID
03and have two standalond drives
03why not?
03for using as a seedbox.
03I need to seed some torrents to boost my ratios
03at sites
03so I gotta tsore the fiels somewhere
03*store
03also hm
03with those server bidding things, would they replace a drive if it dies?
03...holy crap
yeh, you get replacement hardware if it dies
03it's loud as frick
03I don't think that's safe for it to be that low
03yeah I hope not
03at least not anywhere near me
".. and that was the last time we heard from drfsupercenter.."
03LOL
Are you going to seed *that* many torrents at once though?
And have you considered that buying a dedi to use as a seedbox is a bad idea
Why not just buy a seedbox and vps?
I gave up on Ratio's on torrent sites that require it.
>__<
03um
03Where does one buy a seedbox
lol...
03I just prefer one server that does it all
03the only torrents I really use anymore
03are HDBits, and What.cd
03both are elusive ratio trackers
03but they're *good* ones
dedi servers hosts are going to care more about torrents
Meh
03are they?
03OVH didn't give a crap
As in, you might wanna check the ToC
OVH have gone downhill
03yeah :/
To much crap on there network
03why would seedboxes have ToC
03since basically all of them are going to be used for piracy
Anti-Piracy shiz
03that completely defeats the purpose >_>
100gig+
03well
Generally a webui of some kind?
Dunno, never used one
It's all a WebUI
03meaing you just load the torrents through it?
Pretty much
03hm
As seedboxes are basically only really used for piracy
That is all seedboxes are used for Xan XD
You could err
03from a seedbox
03LOL timing
2late
:P
03I did do that though
03at my old university
http://100tbh.com/SeedBox_Hosting.html
03they got all pissy about people torrenting
03like "stop being illegal"
There you go, 100gig for 6euros
03like "Uh, I'm not being illegal"
you might have to try a few seedbox hosts, as they tend to be oversold
03maximum of 8?
8 boxes per port
You would want reviews and <censored>
Not a bad host.
100GB SATA II, with unlimited bandwidth and 8 boxes per port for 6 euros.
038 boxes per port? o.o
Pretty nifty
8 seedboxes
on one port (connection)
03so it has nothing to dow ith me?
03more like "if more than 7 other people sign up, tough luck"?
No >_<
Its contention ratio
03w/e
You and 7 other people are sharing the 1gbit port
03as in, actual seedboxes
03if I use a dedi, it's just "my own computer"
They wouldnt do that

03that are whitelisted
03:/
03well
03it's not JUST for that
03I need a web server too
03but at least that'snot 500

03yes
?
lol
olgjh
03tons of warez and crap
/me runs
olgjh
:P
03hence why I can't use shared hosting
olgjh
03I've been banned from plenty of those
03for violating ToS
Or till they get dmca'ed
Or equiv
03they're in Germany
03the DMCA doesn't really apply
03:)
?
You would be surprised, thus gotta read the ToC
The DMCA is a retard anyway, but yeah, ToC's need to be checked on most server related hosting.
03well
03with OVH I never got into truble.
03*trouble
03granted it wasn't *my* server
03I was renting part of it as a VPS
03actually I think he got ONE, when I was stupid and put up some MIcrosoft-related warez
How much bandwith are you using?
03MS seems t obe the only people actively checking
03not that much
03since apparently the dedi at OVH had 4TB/month and they never used even half of it
03and I wasn't the only person
03I'd totally do that
mhhm
03I had to keep upgrading mine as they keep blacklisting older uTes
03-e
utorrent is one of the popular ones
03they want people using thje newer ones
03and I ahte the newer ones
It looks basically the same >__>
Anyway
I think seedbox+vps is more realistic
uTorrent, Bittorrent and BitComet are the most used ones that I've noticed.
03LMAO BitComet
03that program is total malware
Bitcomet is a PoS
03the first one I ever used was called BitLord
03which is basically BitComet + even more malware
03:/
Or it was
I use uTorrent or Bittorrent (Even though they are literally the same thing XD)
03yeah
ohreally?
03I liked uTorrent 1.8.5 or whatever
I didnt know they did that
03not the 2.x and 3.x
03Yep
03they did
It looks basically the same >__>
^
srsly, they changed a few icons
UDP!
03http://i.imgur.com/Sy63z.png
03I had to tweak the icon to get the "old" style
03I like the round one, not the square one
03</anal>
03but I think 1.8.5 is blacklisted on what.cd now
03or wait no
No comment re icons
:P
03it's allowed on what.cd
03but banned on hdbits
03since most of the music I got came from what.cd
They are generally going to be running the newest version of utorrent
is not going to happen
hard to find a decent torrent client that works on ALL privatetrackers ae?
Or rethink again
03or get a cheaper dedi with less spaced?
03-d
03because I still need a Share boty
03-y
03so I can't just do it here
03:/
Errhm
03yeah
03it's stupid
Depends
03since I can use IIS to host and that way Share works
03stuff like Pok√©mon de English
03they were Japanese DVDs made to teach kids English using Pok√©mon clips.
Tried, bakaBT?
03nope
that I actually would like to see
03I don't speak Japanese but lik,e
03people on P-O just told me a lot of it is only on Share
03nickstr, I've got ISOs
03from Share
cool
03I can share
Nice
03also I laughed
03because they spelled some words wrong
and I have a 1 TB hard drive I am struggling to fill up
/me runs
Also, what.cd, invite only torrent site I'm guessing.
03yep
03invite only
03and they don;'t even give away invitations
/me not interested then :D
03you have to buy them.
03but I managed to get my own
03my friend usotsuki SOMEHOW got an account made since hew as friends with one of the mods
03and all of us just used his account
Buy an invite!? Ok now I'm totally not interested in the site.
03then they added a feature, donate at least $1 and get two invites
03so I donated $1 as him, invited myself, bingo.
The cost of piracy
03well
03what.cd is amazing
03they're even bigger quality whores than I am
03and that site was actually notorious because someone broke into some record studio, physically stole some crap, and put it up on that site :P
Wow

03ah

Instrumental Battle Metal...
/me goes and checks his collection.
03as far as I know, they never released one
03I was checking on discogs and such
I wasn't planning on just looking at Turisas :P
03oh
You read Hetzners ToS
Looks like they disallow P2P but that might be on there VPS's
03Not sure why.;
03but I actually need that
03:/
ubuntu
>broken
03well
03it's on the fricking CD, hence live boot
03I'm gonna try installing from the liveboot
You can add the cd as a repo
LOL
> put every package ever onto a couple of blu-ray disks
03yeah but I mean
Fo sure
03if it's alreadyu there when you live boot it
03then why would it disappear during install
03it's ON THE CD
03well I'm trying install via liveboot
03in VMWare that is
03yeah
03what about it
best partition software
03yeah
03:P
03so it's kind-of a problem if it that disappears x.x

03there's a contact form
Sure, you can get more HDD
03I know
03but even their most expensive VPS is like ¬Ä19
03:P
03so I was just asking if they could customize something
03Xanbreon how would I use the Ubuntu CD as a repo
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu#CD-ROM.2BAC8-DVD-1
03installing VMWare TOols first.
03if I name it something like "danny-desktop", it worked o.o
03can you rename a computer once the OS is installed?
uuuuhhh kinda
you recognise me
Yes
03once it's already installed
03how?
Empoleon
Ermm, you change the err
hostname
03hostname?
sudo nano /etc/hostname
03ah
You put it in there
Then you need to edit the hosts file
To make the hostname resolve to localhost
03ah I see
aka
sudo nano /etc/hosts
03hm, k
03lemme try another installation
Just mimic that
it's ok
i have vague recollections
7Nyeh?
I only remembered because Arti posted something on my DA page like an hour ago and went 'omg I totally forgot about that I'm a terrible person'
03hmm
03http://100tbh.com/Semi_Dedicated.html <- that cheapest one isn't too bad
03it's less than Heztner for similar hardware
yes I was Empoleon before
7Okay.
07I sorta remember that |D
Dont buy VPS's from a seedbox host
haha
03oh dear lord
03leaseweb
03yeah you're right
03I'm not using leaseweb :/
seedbox hosts generally are ok for seeding
Yeh, dont touch
03yeah that ¬Ä6/month one actually seems pretty legit
Might be <censored>
Worst that happens is you cancel and change hosts after a month
03what, for the seedbox?
I leave for like two, three years then suddenly remember
Yeh

03or if I should just throw the stupid drive int he garbage
03oddly enough
03when I do a "full" check disk, the 5-pass one
03if I do the 3-pass one it stops right at the end of 3 and sits there for hours
03again, it's Seagate not wanting to co-operate x.x
03WOAH
03that external one that died after 2 mins
03it magically repaired itself

updates everywhere
03there's this radio station in Flint area, 105.5 FM
03thre's another station, 97.5 I think it is
03both are different stations
03but when I'm on the freeway, once I get a certain amount out of the city
03just 20 seconds behind
03same commercials, songs, everything
03any idea why that would be happening?
might be a relayer
FM stations have to do that sometimes
03hm
due to the line of sight characteristics of VHF
03even though in the city itself, it's a separate station?
or it might be a network
I heard of that happening too
03network?
two radio stations getting the same feed
https://rapidshare.com/files/416341042/The_Search_Is_Over_SRF-A100_AM_stereo.flac
this was one of the results of the tinkering with audio processing
it does happen on FM a bit
because like I said, limited coverage due to line of sight characteristics
back when I was in Washington this was ANNOYING
03hm, that's interesting

lol
Yup, not bad
you seriously didn't read the ToS?
But you need to read the ToS and network rules
EDIS don't really have any ToS or rules that I could find :p
They have a list of accepted uses
generally dedis are like "do whatever you want, just don't get takedown notices"
which is practical, as it means I'm not technically breaking any agreement for running a tiny irc server.
IRC serv3ers, Rusia and Austria only
:P
*servers
where'd you find that? I've been looking several times.
http://en.edis.at/virtual-root-server_82.htm
Right at the top
Well, before the list of servers
because I had to ask about rDNS on Twitter a month or two ago.
LOL TWATTER
but that's annoying, apparently I'm not supposed to run my teensy server in Switzerland.
Oops
yeah, my thoughts, too.
time for a challenge accepted?
/me hides
and.. the text about VPN is confusing. At the very top, they suggest using VPN to Switzerland - and further down, you can't have 'open vpn relays' in Switzerland.
I guess that's just for 'open relays', and not openVPN.
no?
k
nvm then
There wording sucks
Like someone asked them "er, do you have a list of acceptable uses?" and some random sysadmin typed something up at 2am
Probably not too far off from the truth.
they're helpful, though - gotta give them that.
I suppose it kinda depends on the R&R of the datacenters there boxes are in
r&r?
rules and regs
h.
I was practically IMing their support
via email
they replied in like 2 mins
Mhhm
and outside of work hours.
Yeh, have fun with that :P
and why not
IIS actually works, as unpopular as it is.
Sure, it works, just not as well as others
that's my point
Apache is a pretty bad choice for a basic mostly static website
I use nginx, theres lighthttpd and some others which are even lighter but cant link to php/sql if neede
needed
hm
I've heard nginx was good
Its fast, pretty easy to setup and light on the ram and cpu
I dont have that turned on :P
yeh
CGI/Perl
I got PHP to work
php-fpm is a good one to use with nginx
Looks like it
cool
I don't *have* to use IIS, but unlike apache, IIS didn't randomly crap out and die on me
and Apache, for some reason, would give people 56k speeds despite it being a 100mbps connection >_>
er *unlike lighttpd
Bad config
for which?
Whoever was geting bad speeds
oh
it was default Apache config
well
lighttpd and IIS went at the proper speed
apache had issues

I'll just word it like this
1. A(2,7) returns the value stored at position row 2 and column 7 in matrix A.

as am I
lol
anyone?
oh lol
yep
4. A(2,2:3:6) returns the values in row 2, starting in column 2 and going through column 6. The 3 indicates that it should skip 3 values each time, in this case resulting in two values. In a later example such as A(2,2:3:10), it gives three values.

You are setting up a scope of addresses on a DHCP server between 138.90.10.2 through 138.90.10.99. However, you don‚Äôt want to have addresses 138.90.10.7 and 138.90.10.10 in the range of addresses to assign because these addresses are currently used for web servers. Which of the following is the best solution?

Make sure the DHCP server is connected to the network
use device manager to restart the DHCP server

I have to modify that damn repo again?

you know, main non-free etc
you need src in there as well
sad
I always just bung the whole lot in there

need to add src to every frickin' line?
How many repos do you have?!
like 8
But should just need it on the main ones
OI
I added the repos
NOW LOOK IN THEM
You need it on the repo that xchat would come from
I did
# aptitude update
right?

I knew I forgot something

y u still no look
I think it's source, not src
but it /should/ be src
I think it is src
Unless they renamed it
Oh frack
I think it's source
No
You need a line that says

deb-src
I dont screw around with src via apt much, my bad, sorry

03Wow
03*PM
10Late
03yeah
03well considering yesterday I got less than 2 hours of sleep
03I kinda needed it
03also for some reason I can't seem to get a "good night's sleep" anymore
03like
03I kept fricking waking up
03every 2-3 housr
03*hours
10Math is another story
03honestly
03the math on the ACT is not that bad
03nothing harder than algebra
10Well
07keep yourself up 24 hours then go back to sleep at a normal time lol
10Last year, Algebra II, had a bad teacher
03same her
03e
03but trust me
03there's nothing algebra II on there
03at least there wasn't when I took it
10The only thing I understood and could do well was matrices
10There is.
10Sin, cosin, etc.
03that's trig
03and well
/me runs
10w/e, we brushed upon it in Algebra II
10I have this practice booklet for ACT
03*D
03it was like LOL IMAGINARY NUMBERS
10>can't do half the problems
03If they're imaginary, why the f*** are you talkiung about the
03m
03etc
12O.o
10I took a practice one last year
10Math was my lowest score
03math was my highest score o.o
03also wtf
12I suck at maths too
10English/Reading was my highest
03English was my lowest LOL
10:P
10I like math, just takes me more time to understand it
oh?
*hands a piece of Domino's BBQ pizza to Hogia*
aren't you doing compsci or IT now?
03I like math to a point
03what I hate is stupidly complicated math
03read: calculus
04explosions
10lolcalc
03<junh1024-XD> aren't you doing compsci or IT now? <- I am doing compsci, yeah
10Taking Precalc next year
04ohai Quan
06i understand math rather nicely but i despise it lol
03but they call it CSE
03o.o
lolwut
03granted it's not "real" engineering
i do CSE
Computer Systems Engineering
ORLY NAO
03I hate when everybod's like
10Stereotypes
03engineering is all about efficiency, isn't it?
10They exist.
03well
because engineers work a lot with math?
10http://pw0nd.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/StereotypesCops-500x400.jpg
03universities themselves stereotype then :P
03engineering is a really broad area
03XD
inb4 Mythbusters
03as that's entirely calculus
03and I despise calculus
Spanish stereotype: food is like Mexican; truth: Very different
10imagine AP calc
03purely conceptual physics is awesome
03I *had* AP calc
10oh?
03our school didn't have a non-AP calc
10Sucks for you
03oddly enough
03I actually got an A in it
03as I had a really good teacher
03who explained it
12whoa
03in college, they just expect you to figure it out -_-
10Professors won't assist you if you need help?
10eh
And to you.
03it was taught by these Asian grad students
03who didn't write the exams
10I think that's part of their job, either way
Allo.
10They're supposed to teach you
10Not go, "You don't know this, no help for you"
12ugh
03at this school I can get help yeah
03In fact I slightly LOL'd
03my programming teacher
10tutors
03I should totally challenge accepted sometime
12lol
03LOL @ some spam emails
03yeah no thanks
/me runs
10if you're desperate enough
/me hides
03well
12lololol wut
/me hides
12but I know it's spam
03I generally avoid free offers unless they're on Woot
03as those tend to be legit
12never heard of that
03it's a "one deal each day" site
03but there's a community page where people share offers
6http://princess-bonnibel-bubblegum.tumblr.com/post/21043194913?og=1&fb_action_ids=431910466824849&fb_action_types=tumblr-feed%3Alike&fb_source=other_multiline&ref=nf
03and they only really make the main page if enough people validate that it's legit

Inception's whole plot wasn't only to be awesome.
HA
this movie is great
makes me lightheaded
inb4 all civilians are killed
It was partly awesome, and that's all that counts
no it wasn't. It was also a metaphor about how a filmmaker can manipulate its audience through suspension of disbelief.

Hi all.

I just gave up on watching the movie. I've seen it before, I'm here for the conversation.
I've never seen Inception, I hear it's good.
Inception is good
It is not a horror movie

He missed the week we streamed it
inception was boooring

NICE SHOT

Poor bastard :(
We need some moon pies in here.
I'll admit it has good visuals, but it takes a lot more than that to impress me in a movie
I've heard "The Cabin In The Woods" described as "Evil Dead" meets "The Truman Show"
Inception was overhyped because it was "intelligent compared to all the other stupid popcorn flicks."
My local Convenience store has moon pies
about 20% cooler?
0,14EvilDead III was my first movie here
Every man wants to be Bruce Campbell.
Even morso
mai first movie was Time Travelers Wife
Say she's gay
That was awful
That's it
brb
0,14...Yeah, i did
My first full movie was House (I saw the end of Twister)
My first movie was Mulan. Man, I'm old.
0,14I wish I didn't
0,14but i did
This was the first movie I ever saw
I'm gonna have to jog my memory and look at the list, I cannot remember for sure.
my first film was, funnily enough, Inception
Whats that? Send him chapter 20.5 you say?
Way to make me feel ancient by comparison.
0,14I still remember blenders and Octavia's plot
^
Dat plot.
I think the first movie I ever saw was Ghostbusters. My brother watched it all the time, anyway.
The first movie I EVER saw was this one right here.
You guys wanna feel old? When somebody says "A decade ago" you still think of the 90s
BUt the first movie I've ever seen on here?
/me sighs

Octavia's plot? Do I want to know?

The only thing I remember about the 00s is Chappelle's show and The Boondocks.

but bullets can't cause explosions
I used to live in Columbus though and I hope to miove back eventually
