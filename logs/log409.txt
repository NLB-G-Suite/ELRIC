I was impressed that you did it so quickly
lmao
03but that still takes effort
03I'm sure there's a way to crack activation on Vista/7
03but I don't see a point given that I can just abuse the phone system
03it still falls for "yes it's only on 1 PC"
lmaaaao
03well, XP does that too
03I don't use the activation crack on my real machines
03I just phone it
03but for VMs, I'm lazy and just crack it
This is why I use MSDNA keys
woo
03well
03considering I've made and deleted about 10 XP VMs today alone
03I'd run out of keys
03:P
rofl
03don't ask why, I'm testing crap
They are not multiple activation keys?
O-o
03MSDNAA, nope
03one time use
03they're retail keys.
lawl
03TechNet works 10 times
03but that's still only 10 times, not infinite
03well
03they work infinitely on that one machine...
WBV29-DP2KM-MKTXM-CTCDB-MCJ28
u jelly?
03LOL what is that
03XP?
I have one thats thousands of activations or something
yeah
03I have a Win7 enterprise
03that works for 500
or
03also you know what amuses me?
03I got this Windows XP Corporate edition (which, is just VLK version, but pirates are stupid)
03this dude I know on IRC actually stole it from his work, right
03that key is blacklisted now
03but a key I got off some random chinese forum isn't
03and all I did was google "XP VLK key" LOL
TBTDF-AMQGH-66MW7-X929V-8KHG0
that's my dead laptop's one
03yeah but try to actually activate it
03it prolly wosn't work
03-s
maybe
Anyway
/me goes to heat up her pizza
And thank you so much drf :p
03np
/me poofs
okay
so
drf
you
should probably get your server sometime
03I know
03when I figure out which one I want to get
03I'm debating between that french one or hentzer
03or w/e
hetzner's expensive though
03yeah
03it's more than double the price
03wait
03not more than double
03but almost
as for the french one
you need to check
whether they accept international transactions
03if not I can just prod a guy in France
lmao
03I think we have a couple on hoshient
03*net
hetzner requires a CC
03well yeah
03I was going to pay them in cash
/me hides
roffffffffl
yeah, hey hetzner, what's your address again? I need to mail you the payment for this month
03XD
03I mean, PayPal is preferred but w/e
yeah
yay 600 mb to go
You might need to send your passport info or something like that for a dedi
03wtf
03never heard of that o.o
03well the French one she showed me

no, it opens, then closes
wtf
>blame windows
:D
03sigh
03I'd totally get this Hetzner server but it's really fricking expensive
drfffffffffff help
03I have no idea :/
have a look anyway?
03it doesn't give any errors or anything?
They are actually pretty cheap
03well
As far as dedi go
03¬Ä50 a month
03is way over my budget
03even 30 was pushing it
Your budget is to small for what you want
it doesn't give errors at all drf
03well that server is way overkill
it just does the "steam is loading game" thing
03I only need like 2GB of RAM, not 16
03hm
Pick a random old dedi from there auction site
03those are still fairly expensive though
some for 30euros afaik
03yeah but for what you get it sucks
volumedrive.com
urgh
how the hell do you get this game to play
Did you lose your ability to google?
I tried
hm
could be the firewall but I doubt it
What version is it?
gfx card?
If it doesnt say, left click on the exe and properties
of steam?
Of the game
uh
let me find it first
Steam\steamapps\common
doesn't say any version
Properties on the exe, and the details tab?
ah hah!
03hm yeah the cheapest ones that would even work have 2x300GB HDD and are like ¬Ä32
I tried
032.2GHz single core, 2GB RAM
put it as windows xp mode
now gives the d3dx9 dll error
03LOL
03This is why I hate PC gaming
03consoles jsut work :P
Download and install the dx9 redistro
yeah
the fawk
the sdk is 500mb
/me just looks for the dll
Not the sdk you derp
http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=35
yeah I found that already
Just use that
screw you microsoft
I don't want your extra bs
03hm
100mb? o_O
03Operating system: Delivered in Rescue System <- does that mean I can install whatever I wsant?
03*want
Yes
03nice
03I mean I suppose that's not too terrible
03it's like ¬Ä32 or 33
03but still, for only a single core with 2GB of DDR 400MHz? eh
03still expensive x.x
03anyway brb, need to reboot
k
dedi's are expensive
indeeed
inded
indeed
urgh
can't type
yaaaay it works
First thing todo on a win vista or 7 install is to install the dx9 redistro
As ms doesnt bundle all the dlls
Which is retarded but there you go
03anyway

I think the flashing is actually xchat's problem
not mint's
because
it's not even beeping
Weird
hm
it's ballooning

xchat is just standard gtk and opendesktop.org junk
So it shouldnt be to weird
O-o
okay
now it's beeping
beep beep beep
but it's not flashing
Weird
I could install MATE and see how it runs on that
But I like cinnamon

hohoh

Ah
Xanbreon
Figured out the blinking problem
it's to do with linux mint 12
minty mint being crappy
which for some stupid reason does not support taskbar blinking
:D
nfi why 12 doesn't
11 does
and then somehow xchat began stripping colours
so I had to restart and go into its config to change it
anyway tired
I might install 11 tomorrow
or something
now 'night
Look into set options

i got to admit
bash gave me a headache

then c gave me an even worse headache
;o
if it wasn't open book
i would have certainly perished
i remember the commands and such
i just don't remember the punctuation sort of speak
like some things need to be put in ()s and somethings need to be put on a new line
c i didn't understand how you introduce variables
:<
aww
oh well
since shell script was so basic
it was probably the easiest for me
bash
perl is kind of like javascript except you use $ to say "this is a variable"
c i have no clue
at least it was a simple program
"ask user to enter 2 numbers, then add the numbers together and display that sum"

yo
hi pancake
How are you?
i'm ok
So Linux was hard?
Well, it makes little sense
yes it is
but microsoft is harder
i actually passed the linux test
Hmm
Lololol
linux is easier
only because
it was open book
:P
excuses
to be honest
i probably would have failed the microsoft test even if it was open book
because the book stinks
it doesn't get to the point and strays around the corner
it's not concise enough
What exactly were you tested on?
Umbreon hates windows?
i don't hate windows
i hate windows classes
because they go so far in depth of the operating system
most people have a basic concept of windows so they make you go super far into the systems features
Isnt that what they are supposed to do?
Go in depth
linux class, not many people know linux so they only touch the surface
but you should take it step by step
not go off the deep end right away
What do they ask?
:p
wanna go over the questions in the test i got wrong?
i just pulled up the test
so XD
do it
:p
	
A group‚Äôs scope refers to the types of domain controllers present in the environment.
T or F
i got that wrong
is it T?
:o
:<
i answered T
so no, it's not True
The first steps in a general strategy for implementing groups in an environment is to create user accounts and organize them into domain local groups.
true or false
false again?
:s
correct
i answered true XD
LOL
set up the groups first
then add users
.v.
it depends -.-
Next question
:p
you need to add accounts before anything else
if you have no users, you won't have a general idea of what groups need to be made
Effective permissions are determined by the cumulative share and security permissions, not the cumulative share and cumulative security permissions evaluated individually.
and of course i got lost in the wording of that statement
O.o
o-o
true or false
well
seems to be true?
;<
I bet it is false
:P
no
it's false
LOL
well the wording
see
stupid teacher :P
wtf are they asking
LOL
sorry with the multiple choice portion
CULMAgtIVIErjgfjdnf
i don't have access to all the choices given
:<
only what i answered
NTFS permissions can be set at which of the following? (choose the best answer)
i answered partition level and apparently that was wrong
i think the other choices was file level
directory level
and share level
file level
makes sense
But
Share evel maybe
though
NTFS is a file system
you can set folder permissions
file permissions
not a blasted type of permission
lOL
No
When a user accesses a file locally, and there are both NTFS and share permissions on the file, which permissions are actually used?
permissions FOR the file system
:p
UHwaut
Uh, I suppose the network permission?
I guess ovo
now you know why he irritates me?
Why?
:<
this teacher
the questions are so concepty
The minimum password age policy defines the number of days that a password must be used before a user is allowed to change it.
true or false
Depends if they are accessing it locally or remotely O-o
Or, theres stuff about ownership as well
the best part about this question
:<
it contradicts a question in the test that i got right
Which of the following password policy items defines the number of days that a password can be used before the user is required to change it?
i answered "maximum password age"
and got it right
uh
Thats just derp
max = min
LOL
isn't
but blah
crazy teachers
:P
so i looked at that true or false question and thought "well if this question is right then that question has to be false"
nope
it was a true statement
O.o
Bututut
bfjdfn
basically
one question says one thing
then the other question says something completely different
A group's ____ refers to the logical boundary within which a group can be assigned permissions to a specific resource within an Active Directory domain or forest.
that was short answer
i had to type the answer into a textbox
any guesses? because i have no clue
should i continue?

7Weeell, Protect can help with that.
i know
what doesn't protect help against though
7What are you using Charizard exactly for in Doubles?
Hmm
I,m contemplating it because it was stubborn to get in an Ultra Ball even with a burn
7Dusk Balls?
heat wave user
7Okaaay, but it's rather mediocre as one. :/
and doesn't get pounded by garchomp's earthquake
7Zapdos or Chandelure work.
zapdos was considered
but it doesn't STAB heat wave
7It can get Discharge. :P
and i think i calculated that zapdos and garchomp have a common weakness
7Which is common, but effective.
7Ice.
7So Blizzard = D:
yeah
there is no common weaknes upon charizard and garchomp so yeah
it's an okay core
Hmm
even if charizard is a bit to be required for stats
Perhaps that'll help
Since it be a cavemon
too bad i probably can't get a dream world charizard
that ability is interesting as heck
7Sun in Doubles, hmm?
i probably won't make a weather team
in the end i'll have a counter tema
team
to fight off the 4 most popular pokemon
according to a PO server's statistics that majors in VGC
so that would be...
From 01/02 - 01/08
-----------------------------------
13530 battles
# 1 - Zapdos (22.49 %)
# 2 - Latios (19.85 %)
# 4 - Hitmontop (18.87 %)
13!chatstats
13not working? D:
:<
poor thing
7Hmm...
7Well, Ice does work there.
i heard toast rotom is really awesome against zapdos
XD
7...toast?
yes
heat
7Funny way of saying it, but yes.
watching some videos
7Resists Fire/Electric/Ice. :P
and can hit back pretty neatly
lol
7Hmm...
7Unfortunately, Heat Rotom's weak to Surf and Rock Slide.
7A Drizzle-based team might not fare well for that. :/
7But you can't cover absolutely everything. X.x
i know
heat rotom is weak to 3 of the most common spread moves
7Three?
/me 7missed one? o.O
well
i guess i forgot about levitate
fine if it somehow loses levitate then it's weak to earthquake as well
XD
7Okaaay. :P
i need to make an excel sheet
that will analyze a moveset
7For?
and will look at every type and tally up what you have weakness coverage of
7Psypokes has one.
and what could possibly wall that moveset

7Welcome. :)
i just hope i can throw a team together in time for the tournament
this was kind of a last minute thought
7You could always try for VGC13.
7I've planned my CPAC team since... well, since the last one ended. XD
XD
what is the rules for 13?
i've played the TCG for 6-7 years
maybe more (i've lost track)
and i'm getting sick of the format being always the same formula
7Well, I'm not too sure.
7Only last year was there a restriction on non-certain-legendaries, I think.
/me 7checks.
that's one thing
at least they have a banlist
the TCG doesn't have a ban list
I got a 10pack of Spanish cards today
okay let's go over this
this is a list of what got first place in state championships 2 weeks or so ago
Zekrom/Eelektrik x24
Celebi/Mewtwo/Tornadus x18
Durant x4
Landorus/Terrakion x3
Donphan/Mewtwo x2
Straight Celebi/Mewtwo x2
Reshiphlosion x2
x1 Victories:
Straight Terrakion
Magnezone/Eelektrik
Terrakion/Tornadus
Magneboar
7o.O
59 decks
40% of them was won by one deck
7 of them were won by decks that are meant to beat that deck
or 11%
51% of the format revolves around one deck in otherwords
7Centralization. O.o
yes
that's what the TCG has been for 3-4 years
one deck takes hold of the format
and you either play that deck
or play something that beats it
7Doesn't sound very creative. X3
exactly
80% of the players were playing the same deck
that is no exageration, that was a true statistic
7o.O
7X.x
i'm getting sick of this pattern
7There's slightly more variety in VGCs. :)
skarmbliss PO server
the most popular pokemon is .... not even 25%
i think it's 22% or something
and guess what
7You're using none of them?
i'm sure that in those 22% of the matches
most of them weren't the same exact team
7Hence the difference in percentages.
they aren't doing anything to fix the format either
the next set is going to be an expansive set
to only make the current popular decks even better
02oh, you mean skarmbliss stall?
no
skarmbliss server
02oh
that's the name of the actual server
but sure, they are named after the common skarmory blissey combo :P
02yeah, that compo now does fear salamence now, since he isn¬¥t banned anymore
owo
hello
7Hey, Twilly. :D
02heyo
The chatbox on the forums won't work for me OTL
7Can't help you with that. :/
It says I have to have a "profile" or something
DX
Vanilla tastes good
lol XP
MysticLugia
that combo was dead the second DP came out
02he can mixedsweep too x3
stab fire
and stab fighting
yes and that
02you actually HAVE to mixed sweep for that, otherwise one of the other still fully can stall you with their (sp)defense unless you have a other pokemon to switch out for that
lol
oh well
will make things so much easier
i just have to look at common movepools for the 3 most common pokemon and see what turns up

03Sky High?
10that movie
12never saw it
03it was alright
12twas a Disney, correct?
12a live-action Disney
03yes
12kay
12they CAN make good ones
12a la Hocus Pocus
03that's old though
03and I've never seen it
12and?
03it seems strange
12...wow
12watch it next October
03and it wasn't until recently that Disney started sucking
03:P
12true
03fine, go watch half the movies I've told you to watch
03:D
12but they DO have it in them
12Tangled was good

03...
12*?
03no>?
03both were in Bolt
03AFAIK"
12probably
12and Tangled?
03I don't know who the VAs were in Tangled but it seems stupid enough anyway
03it's like Rapunzel on crack
12what issue do you have in that?
12...
12it's as "stupid" as some of the more classic fairy tales
03my main issue with that is that it's an animated movie made since about 10 years ago that isn't DreamWorks or Pixar
03:P
12that Disney made
03I mean, it's not like I'm just refusing to watch movies and going "gee, I don't have any movies to watch"
03I still have tons
03:P
12I know you do
12but you can't see the forest for the trees
03I should prolly watch 8 Mile next xD
03...you should teach my social sciences class
03my teacher is obsessed with that forest/trees analogy

03and Kiss is regular rock
lol
03it seems like a lot of these guys paint their faces all weird
hey
03Turisas apparently does that too
metal had to start someplace
03I just don't get what the point is XD
all music came from the classics
:D
03bands like Bon Jovi are cool, they don't need to dress up :P
except weird al
he's in a league of his own
4-6 plz
03I have the original floppy disks of 4 and 6:D
03that actually install
03if you want them
035, I don't own sadly :(
03I had to pirate it
Aww
03well
But okay
13yarrr
03I can get you the pre-installed one
03or
Well
03there's this one site that has all the floppy disk images
I'd like to try to install them into DOSbox :P
as I doubt they'll work in CMD prompt/windows
03they would
03if it's x86
03but you won't have sound
03and the music is the best part of those games, IMO
03Bobby Prince was an awesome composer
okay

03you can get Keen 1-5 for $5
03total
03and that includes dosbox and all that
03b ut I was a bit annoyed at no Keen 6
03as that's one of the best 3 :/
03I hate the first 3 games, sure they were revolutionary but it's more like NES than SNES and the stupid sound effects are annoying
03the music is what made those games good. Same with most SNES games I think people would agree
I don't enjoy the original SNES/NES games for the music, more the nostalgia and fun memories.

Granted the music for them was fun and enjoyable.
But if you only play the game for it's soundtrack then there is no real point in playing it.
03yeah, but it's just not the same if you play SNES games on mute
03well
03depends on the game really.
03but stuff like Super Mario Bros
03you can't NOT like the music :P
DUDE, SMB WAS BEST
03but the Keen games, honestly, were revolutionary in terms of music for their day.
Still is
!roara
Aurora play dead!
03they came out in 1991, and had realy pro-sounding music, better than SNES
/me dies
03if you've heard of Bobby Prince, he did the music for tem
03*Them
Hai Aurora :>
03but the first 3 Keen games had no music, only PC-speaker sound effects, it's basically...like listening to a dial-up modem while playing x.x
6hiiiii <3
hullo
/me hugs Aurora "How are yous?, and drf, that's practically most of the old retro classics"
03for which systemsa?
03-a
SNES
03most NES games had music
03erm
03SNES, even
03here let me find an example of the original Keens
03but what's amazing
03is Keen 1-3 were 1990
03and 4-6 were 1991
I loved a TON of the music from the NES, I even own some of the original tracks.
03Keen 4-6 had twice the resolution, actual music... etc

03Just one year later
03much better graphics, and actual catchy music
that is weird :|
03that's why I prefer 4-6
with dosbox
03over the first 3 :P
I thought I installed
the first ima
but it does nothing
it doesn't even ask me for disk 2
03did you run install.bat?
Well drf, a lot of games changed the music quite eratically in short periods of time.
yeah
03I know
03but my point being
It said "Done"
03I have a legit reason for liking 4-6 better
03XD
XD
03plus, I grew up playing 5 and 6
03er
It made a directory too
03*4 and 6
03I didn't even know about 1-3
03as they don't actually use the numbers
03it wasn't until much later I realized there were more.
I still remember the NES versions of Final Fantasy, the soundtracks on them cpmpared to the SNES ones. Major difference in sound.
Despite them being like
6-18 months apart.
Finally done with homework!
Homework... WHAT IS THIS WORD
I mean
Hi
lol
I never did homework XD
03...did this brand new hard drive just die?
o-o
03oh, and it's a Seagate too, this is expected

03:/

I'm not sure what my lacie is
But I haven't had a problem at all
XD
03well, Seagate is a crappy brand either way
Depends
I have an old 40GB Seagate HDD
03yeah, OLD
03but ever since like 2005
03or so
03they suck
Almost 5 years old, still working perfectly
03erm, OK
And my 1TB External is a Seagate (Granted it's almost dead >.>) but it's lasted almost 3 years.
2 or 3 years, I dunno, can't rememeber when I bought it.
Point is, Seagate is an OK brand for Harddrives.
03if OK means "I know this drive is going to break and am just waiting for that day" then sure
Like every HDD
No matter the brand.
They all die eventually.
03WDs tend to last longer though
03and less random dying at a very early stage
03like this one which I literally ust got 2 hours ago.
03*just
i think it's just your luck
^
Anyway, as I said, Windows 7 hates Seagate drives.
03well
oh?
03I just plugged it into one of the university computers
03that runs XP
03still dead.
03sigh
03I'll go yell at amazon for a replacement -_-
03frick
03Amazon is out of stock
03so they can't give me a replacement
03x.x
oh hi
03XP doesn't care, meaning you can have XP on a dying drive and it won't know
03:P
03so basically your drive is probably about to die.
I already know that, don't need a OC to tell me that my drive is almost dead.
OS*
03well, not everybody is that smart
/me shrugs
03for example, I had this boot drive, I was running Windows 7 when it popped up a "Your drive has reported issues, you should replace it"
03I would not have known otherwise as I don't regularly test my drives
03Just for kicks I installed XP on it
03didn't care at all
03I wouldn't have known and it woulda just died one day
03:P
03but instead I got a replacement since it was still under warranty
XP is pro, doesn't care about anything 8D
Because at least with XP you get the chance to make backups of important files before the drive does die.
03it's not that it didn't care, so much as it didn't know
03because XP didn't include SATA stuff
03IDE drives don't self-monitor
03So starting with Vista, it included the SATA/SMART drivers and would actually check
03and huh? Windows 7 doesn't stop you from using the drive before it dies
Basically microsofts way of saying they want more money :P
03it just tells you there's a problem with it
03you can just close the popup and be on your way LOL
Nope, not always
03weird
03for me it did
Im pretty damn sure S.M.A.R.T has been around for longer than SATA
03has it?
03I've never seen any IDE drives that did SMART reporting
03or rather
03any BIOSes that knew what that was
Can't even open my 1TB drive on Windows 7
03wtf?
Hmm, both standardised in the same year
03yeah that's what I thought
Windows 7 literally tells my external HDD to die in a fire.
03I haven't seen IDE drives and/or BIOSes for IDE motherboards that know what SMART is
Where as windows XP just goes "yep drive works, enjoy your files and shiz"
Well
There defo where IDE drives that had SMART built in
03but I don;'t think the motherboard knew how to handle it
http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/disk_smart_view.html
IDE/SATA disk.
03hm, so Xanbreon do you think this is a good price?
03Hardware details:
032x HDD 320 GB SATA
032x RAM 1024 MB DDR-400
03AMD Athlon 64 3700+
03Root Server SB 32
03Setup (once): 32.00 ¬Ä
03Price (monthly): 32.00 ¬Ä
Its cheap fore sure
Its not going to be a powerhouse though
03well yeah
03I'd prefer 4GB of RAM, but for some reason those ones are like ¬Ä45 a month or more
02going to bed now
03which is a bit much of a price hike for 2GB of RAM...
03not sure why they're tiered like that
03literally exact same CPU and HDDs, just more RAM
it is morning
actually afternoon..
You know thats single core, right
03yes
03all of them are, unless you wanna pay ¬Ä60+ a month
dedi's are expensive, however you cut it
03those ones literally cost more than the EX servers
03https://robot.your-server.de/order/market/sortcol/hd/sorttype/down/page/2
03I'm looking at the 2x320GB ones
03since oddly they're the same price as the 2x300GB
03so yay 40GB more
02Well, Nini everyone~
Theres some x2's with hwr for 38euro
03really?
03oh yeah
03I see those
03well
pair of 320's though
03when they say hardware RAID, do they let you pick the config?
03as I'd rather just not have RAID
03and have two standalond drives
Thats not a very smart idea
03why not?
At least on RAID1 you will be able to limp around until you can get a HDD swapped
03I actually need most of that space so if I were to use RAID I'd need like 2x500
Your budget is to small for a sane server config =/
I really dont get what you want all that space for
I mean, wares, woo
03for using as a seedbox.
03I need to seed some torrents to boost my ratios
03at sites
03so I gotta tsore the fiels somewhere
03*store
03also hm
03with those server bidding things, would they replace a drive if it dies?
03or is it one of those "do what you want, we won't do w/e"
03...holy crap
yeh, you get replacement hardware if it dies
03some airplane is flying REALLY LOW above my dorm
03it's loud as frick
03I don't think that's safe for it to be that low
inb4 crash crash boom
03yeah I hope not
03at least not anywhere near me
03it can crash somewhere else :/
03LOL
Are you going to seed *that* many torrents at once though?
I mean, a few popular ones should keep your ratio up
And have you considered that buying a dedi to use as a seedbox is a bad idea
Why not just buy a seedbox and vps?
I gave up on Ratio's on torrent sites that require it.
>__<
03um
03Where does one buy a seedbox
lol...
03I just prefer one server that does it all
One shoves seedbox into google
03the only torrents I really use anymore
03are HDBits, and What.cd
03both are elusive ratio trackers
03but they're *good* ones
dedi servers hosts are going to care more about torrents
Meh
03are they?
03OVH didn't give a crap
03they were like "here's your bandwidth, enjoy"
As in, you might wanna check the ToC
OVH have gone downhill
03yeah :/
To much crap on there network
Xanbreon: You have to check the ToC on most seedbox hosts nowadays.
03why would seedboxes have ToC
03since basically all of them are going to be used for piracy
Anti-Piracy shiz
03that completely defeats the purpose >_>
So they dont get shutdown
What Xanbreon said.
You can get 100gig of space and tons of bandwith for $15 or less on a seedbox
100gig+
03well
03do those give you a GUI and stuff or is it just some web interface like "click he3re to load your torrents"?
Generally a webui of some kind?
Dunno, never used one
It's all a WebUI
03meaing you just load the torrents through it?
Pretty much
03hm
03but if they have ToS that say you can't do illegal stuff...
Its normally "dont do illegal stuff or we will terminate you, if we get dcma'ed"
Cover your arse crap
As seedboxes are basically only really used for piracy
That is all seedboxes are used for Xan XD
You could err
Seed your fav linux distro!111!
03inb4 no, I';m going to seed some Linux distros
03from a seedbox
03LOL timing
2late
:P
03I did do that though
03at my old university
http://100tbh.com/SeedBox_Hosting.html
03they got all pissy about people torrenting
03like "stop being illegal"
03so I downloaded a bunch of Linux distros and seeded them
There you go, 100gig for 6euros
03like "Uh, I'm not being illegal"
you might have to try a few seedbox hosts, as they tend to be oversold
031GBiT Shared Connection (Maximum of 8) <- what does that mean
03maximum of 8?
8 boxes per port
I just pulled them out of a google search
You would want reviews and <censored>
Not a bad host.
I mean some hosts even will give you a box for a day or so under trial
100GB SATA II, with unlimited bandwidth and 8 boxes per port for 6 euros.
038 boxes per port? o.o
Pretty nifty
03I'm still not sure what that means
8 seedboxes
on one port (connection)
03so it has nothing to dow ith me?
03more like "if more than 7 other people sign up, tough luck"?
So you are sharing your bandwith with 8 people
No >_<
Its contention ratio
03w/e
03problem is, I think hdbits and all that *may* ban seedboxes
You and 7 other people are sharing the 1gbit port
03as in, actual seedboxes
03if I use a dedi, it's just "my own computer"
They wouldnt do that
Cos that would be retarded
Why would they care how you got your ratio?
Ratio based torrent sites that ban seedboxes are pathetic.
^
03well
And if you basically just want a vps for statbot
You could get away with a 8euro/month kvm box
03I know both of the sites I use have very specific torrent clients
03that are whitelisted
03:/
03well
03it's not JUST for that
03I need a web server too
03and I have about 90GB of files so far :P
03but at least that'snot 500
iiim baakkk
bukkake
90gig?!
03yes
?
lol
olgjh
03tons of warez and crap
/me runs
Well duh
olgjh
:P
03hence why I can't use shared hosting
olgjh
03I've been banned from plenty of those
03for violating ToS
03dedis tend to not give a crap what you do as long as they get their money
Or till they get dmca'ed
Or equiv
03they're in Germany
03the DMCA doesn't really apply
03:)
?
You would be surprised, thus gotta read the ToC
The DMCA is a retard anyway, but yeah, ToC's need to be checked on most server related hosting.
03well
03with OVH I never got into truble.
03*trouble
03granted it wasn't *my* server
03I was renting part of it as a VPS
03but the guy I was renting from said he never got any DMCA complaints.
03actually I think he got ONE, when I was stupid and put up some MIcrosoft-related warez
How much bandwith are you using?
03MS seems t obe the only people actively checking
03not that much
03since apparently the dedi at OVH had 4TB/month and they never used even half of it
03and I wasn't the only person
03PHP Proxy Included <- xD
03I'd totally do that
03hm, so that site uses uTorrent?
03I believe that's white listed, depending on the version
mhhm
03I had to keep upgrading mine as they keep blacklisting older uTes
03-e
utorrent is one of the popular ones
03they want people using thje newer ones
03and I ahte the newer ones
03they completely f'ed up the GUI and stuff
It looks basically the same >__>
Anyway
I think seedbox+vps is more realistic
considering your tiny budget
uTorrent, Bittorrent and BitComet are the most used ones that I've noticed.
03LMAO BitComet
03that program is total malware
Bitcomet is a PoS
03the first one I ever used was called BitLord
03which is basically BitComet + even more malware
03:/
Banned most places cos its easy to fake ratio with it
Or it was
I use uTorrent or Bittorrent (Even though they are literally the same thing XD)
03yeah
03when uTorrent merged with BitTorrent is when it started sucking
ohreally?
03I liked uTorrent 1.8.5 or whatever
I didnt know they did that
03not the 2.x and 3.x
03Yep
03they did
03and they started making it look more noob friendly >_>
It looks basically the same >__>
^
03I'm anal about it
srsly, they changed a few icons
And added stuff like
UDP!
Which is far better than TCP for bittorrent
03http://i.imgur.com/Sy63z.png
03I had to tweak the icon to get the "old" style
03I like the round one, not the square one
03</anal>
03but I think 1.8.5 is blacklisted on what.cd now
03or wait no
No comment re icons
:P
03it's allowed on what.cd
03but banned on hdbits
03since most of the music I got came from what.cd
They are generally going to be running the newest version of utorrent
So w.e
Anyway, finding a vps with 90gig of space
is not going to happen
So, you are going to need to trim some of the crap
hard to find a decent torrent client that works on ALL privatetrackers ae?
Or rethink again
03or get a cheaper dedi with less spaced?
03-d
03because I still need a Share boty
03-y
03Share is a Japanese p2p that only works on Windows, no WINE or naything
03and requires completely unfirewalled Internet
03so I can't just do it here
03:/
Errhm
What a PoS
03yeah
03it's stupid
03but it's the only way to get some rare anime stuff :/
03hence why I was running Windows Server
Depends
03since I can use IIS to host and that way Share works
On what you mean by 'Rare'
03stuff like Pok√©mon de English
03they were Japanese DVDs made to teach kids English using Pok√©mon clips.
03funny stuff
Tried, bakaBT?
03nope
that I actually would like to see
03I don't speak Japanese but lik,e
03people on P-O just told me a lot of it is only on Share
03from Share
cool
03when I get a new server
03I can share
Nice
03also I laughed
03because they spelled some words wrong
03explains why Asians can't spell for crap
and I have a 1 TB hard drive I am struggling to fill up
/me runs
Also, what.cd, invite only torrent site I'm guessing.
still have about 800 GB or so free
03yep
03invite only
03and they don;'t even give away invitations
/me not interested then :D
03you have to buy them.
03but I managed to get my own
03basically, they were super elusive and didn't let any new members in for a couple years
03my friend usotsuki SOMEHOW got an account made since hew as friends with one of the mods
03and all of us just used his account
Buy an invite!? Ok now I'm totally not interested in the site.
03then they added a feature, donate at least $1 and get two invites
03so I donated $1 as him, invited myself, bingo.
The cost of piracy
Trololololol
03well
03what.cd is amazing
03they're even bigger quality whores than I am
03and that site was actually notorious because someone broke into some record studio, physically stole some crap, and put it up on that site :P
Wow
lol
03have you heard this song?
/me 06is listening to 03¬ª¬ª 02Turisas - Battle Metal 2008 [Bonus] (Battle Metal (Deluxe Edition)) 03¬´¬ª 0201:31/04:04 [202,02|02,02|02,02|02,02|02,02|02,02|303,03|03,03|03,03|03,03|03,03|03,03|03,03|03,03|03,03|03,03|02] 03¬´¬ª 02276 kbps m4a - 8.77MB (WinAmp) 03¬´¬´

Turisas is a band I know pretty well
03ah
03haven't heard any of their other stuff
03but I have the whole CD
Saw em live so yeah xD
03I really want an instrumental of Battle Metal
03since I kinda hate this dude's screaming
03but the music itself is nice
Hmm

/me goes and checks his collection.
03as far as I know, they never released one
03I was checking on discogs and such
I wasn't planning on just looking at Turisas :P
03oh
You know what
You read Hetzners ToS
Looks like they disallow P2P but that might be on there VPS's
03so Xanbreon, this is really weird. Ubuntu 9.04, if I live-boot it, has the Partition Editor... but if I *install it*, that disappears
03Not sure why.;
03but I actually need that
03:/
O-o
ubuntu
>broken
03well
03I even disconnected the network thingy so it can't try to find repos that dont'exist anymore
03it's on the fricking CD, hence live boot
03I'm gonna try installing from the liveboot
You can add the cd as a repo
LOL
> put every package ever onto a couple of blu-ray disks
No internet Linux yay?
03yeah but I mean
Fo sure
03if it's alreadyu there when you live boot it
03then why would it disappear during install
03it's ON THE CD
You can do a local repo mirror if you want as well
03well I'm trying install via liveboot
03in VMWare that is
03I need a Linux that has GParted installed in a VM so I can format flash drives and crap easily
03since I don't trust Windows for partitioning >_>
gparted O-o
03yeah
03what about it
best partition software
03yeah
03as much as "LOL Linux in VMs", I just boot up my Ubuntu VM, plug in drives, partition them, done
03:P
03so it's kind-of a problem if it that disappears x.x
:P
ud of
uuuuuuuu
03o.o
03meh
03I'm still considering just getting one of those Hetzner dedisd
03-d
03the bidding ones
03but I did email them asking if it would be possible to customize a VPS with more hard drive space
03I'll see what they say :P
Emailed who?
03Hetzner.
03there's a contact form
Sure, you can get more HDD
but it will cost
03I know
03but even their most expensive VPS is like ¬Ä19
03:P
03so I was just asking if they could customize something
03I just want to see what they say
03oh for the love of god
03Xanbreon how would I use the Ubuntu CD as a repo
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu#CD-ROM.2BAC8-DVD-1
03installing VMWare TOols first.
03I wonder if it borks because I name the computer "UbuntuVM"
03if I name it something like "danny-desktop", it worked o.o
03can you rename a computer once the OS is installed?
o jesus do I even recognise anybody in here anymore
uuuuhhh kinda
03I was asking Xanbreon
you recognise me
What
03also hi Lava, what was your username before?
03Can you rename the PC name in Linux
Yes
03once it's already installed
03how?
Empoleon
Ermm, you change the err
hostname
03yeah but what do I actually type
03hostname?
sudo nano /etc/hostname
03ah
You put it in there
Then you need to edit the hosts file
To make the hostname resolve to localhost
03ah I see
aka
sudo nano /etc/hosts
03hm, k
03lemme try another installation
And you should see an entry for your current hostname
Just mimic that
uuh I guess nobody remembers, it's been a really long time. years or something.
it's ok
i have vague recollections
7Nyeh?
I only remembered because Arti posted something on my DA page like an hour ago and went 'omg I totally forgot about that I'm a terrible person'
03hmm
03http://100tbh.com/Semi_Dedicated.html <- that cheapest one isn't too bad
03it's less than Heztner for similar hardware
7Did you have any alternate names, Lava, before?
yes I was Empoleon before
7Okay.
07I sorta remember that |D
Dont buy VPS's from a seedbox host
haha
03oh dear lord
03leaseweb
03yeah you're right
03I'm not using leaseweb :/
this is what happens when I forget about something
seedbox hosts generally are ok for seeding
But for anything more latency sensitive or stuff
Yeh, dont touch
03yeah that ¬Ä6/month one actually seems pretty legit
7What, Lava? O.o
Might be <censored>
03I'm contemplating getting it just for lulz anyway xD
Worst that happens is you cancel and change hosts after a month
03what, for the seedbox?
I leave for like two, three years then suddenly remember
Yeh
7Ah, well; if it's not so significant, why not?
uuh well I'm going to go to bed, I guess I'll be bad tomorrow if I don't totally forget for two more years
7XD
7Weeeell, admittedly, there's not much to worry about.

04Check the sprite gallery for me, would you?
04I actually posted something :'D
7Will do!
04Thank'ee
7:)
04And yes, that's why I was asking for 3rd Gen sprite specifics
7Wondered if it was for a game or something. :P
hi quan and drake
eh.. xD; rough break, you?
7:<
yay Drake
7I'm quite okay, thanks. :P
i got to make 3 teams by sunday
04heya Bree
04lol good luck
that's good to hear @ quan (:
7I have to check parametrics for math sometime.
thanks
7And type up some pseudo-essay. D:
good luck with that
nom
04Quan stop using Sesquepidilian Loquaciousness on me.
04I'm smart, just not THAT smart.
04I had to use dictionary.com for congruency, and I STILL can't understand your sentence.
7O.o

7Symmetrical?
7Dah, that 'a' is supposed to be a 'and'.
7*fix*
04XD
nom
hi Ecco!
wb Ecco
hi
hey Umbreon, and how is everyone this evening?
03OK, so that was weird
03apparently it's just the fuel cap that's loose or something
03which is why it says "check engine"
03but that's not even part of the engine LOL
`\(¬∞.o)/¬¥
03hi
no
12hai
03LL
03guess my new luck with Seagate
03record dying times :D
125?
1210?
03minutes? Yes
03basically
12XD
03I got this $130 drive from Amazon
03plug it in, notice it's actually Seagate
03unplug it
03plug it back in
03it's dead.
03within like 2 minutes.
03which is a real shame as that drive is totally suited to me
03it's coated in rubber so it can withstand being dropped :D
03supposedly they even ran over one with a truck and it survived
12lol wow
03but if the drive itself dies after less than 5 minutes...
lol
03I'm basically holding a shiny piece of metal -_-
12then Seagate hates you
03Yep.
12:3
03so I sent the company an email
03asking if they can replace it with a non-Seagate
03:/
12full of obscene language?
03no
12:"D
12aw
/me hides
03swearing at people never gets you anywhere
12exactrly
12-r
03>_>
Frack off drf
That made me feel better
Does that count?
:D
03seriously though
03check this thing out
03http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0058VIWTM/
03look at the pictures
03that orange stuff is all rubber
But is it DRF proof?
03apparently not
03as it lasted less than 2 mins
03hence angry emails
Hahah
03http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/sc_b0058viwxi-fea01.jpg
03yeah see
03they show someone running it over with a car
03http://i.imgur.com/R8CXr.jpg
03I wonder if there's any point in waiting still
03or if I should just throw the stupid drive int he garbage
03oddly enough
03when I do a "full" check disk, the 5-pass one
03it does passes 1-4 fine and gets stuck on 5
03if I do the 3-pass one it stops right at the end of 3 and sits there for hours
03again, it's Seagate not wanting to co-operate x.x
03WOAH
03the drive came back to life
03that external one that died after 2 mins
03it magically repaired itself
updates
updates everywhere
more tinkering with Sound Solution and the transmitter resulted in a surprise
I have duplicated the stereo channel separation and frequency response associated with FM on the AM band
03there's this radio station in Flint area, 105.5 FM
03thre's another station, 97.5 I think it is
03both are different stations
03but when I'm on the freeway, once I get a certain amount out of the city
0397.5 quite literally becomes an identical mirror station to 105.5
03just 20 seconds behind
03same commercials, songs, everything
03any idea why that would be happening?
might be a relayer
FM stations have to do that sometimes
03hm
due to the line of sight characteristics of VHF
03even though in the city itself, it's a separate station?
or it might be a network
I heard of that happening too
03network?
two radio stations getting the same feed
https://rapidshare.com/files/416341042/The_Search_Is_Over_SRF-A100_AM_stereo.flac
this was one of the results of the tinkering with audio processing
it does happen on FM a bit
because like I said, limited coverage due to line of sight characteristics
back when I was in Washington this was ANNOYING
I hated listening to FM in some areas because the multipath and flutter was severe
03hm, that's interesting
03the registry hack to get the Zune hardware to show up as a flash drive in Windows
03still works under XP
03the newest version
03just not in Windows 7
03that's actually extremely useful for backing mine up and restoring it
03takes less time xD
03time to do more Rock Band drumming until my arms fall off again

13:<
XD
lol
anyway Xanbreon, not a bad deal for what I'm getting, eh?
Yup, not bad
you seriously didn't read the ToS?
But you need to read the ToS and network rules
granted that EX server is a lot better but I'm already paying over my budget as is
and meh, will do later
EDIS don't really have any ToS or rules that I could find :p
They have a list of accepted uses
generally dedis are like "do whatever you want, just don't get takedown notices"
which is practical, as it means I'm not technically breaking any agreement for running a tiny irc server.
IRC serv3ers, Rusia and Austria only
:P
*servers
where'd you find that? I've been looking several times.
http://en.edis.at/virtual-root-server_82.htm
Right at the top
Well, before the list of servers
right, that must be new.. I can't remember seeing that earlier o.O
because I had to ask about rDNS on Twitter a month or two ago.
LOL TWATTER
but that's annoying, apparently I'm not supposed to run my teensy server in Switzerland.
Oops
They probs wont notice unless you get attacked or something
yeah, my thoughts, too.
time for a challenge accepted?
/me hides
and.. the text about VPN is confusing. At the very top, they suggest using VPN to Switzerland - and further down, you can't have 'open vpn relays' in Switzerland.
I guess that's just for 'open relays', and not openVPN.
you ever used Windows VPNs, Lakorv?
no?
k
nvm then
There wording sucks
Like someone asked them "er, do you have a list of acceptable uses?" and some random sysadmin typed something up at 2am
Probably not too far off from the truth.
they're helpful, though - gotta give them that.
I suppose it kinda depends on the R&R of the datacenters there boxes are in
r&r?
so is Hetzner :p
rules and regs
h.
I was practically IMing their support
via email
they replied in like 2 mins
Mhhm
and outside of work hours.
I just need to temp upload this Windows Server ISO somewhere as they require *my* ISO to ensure the key works
Yeh, have fun with that :P
I was considering just using Debian but I am far too used to Windows
and why not
IIS actually works, as unpopular as it is.
Sure, it works, just not as well as others
that's my point
even on Linux, I've had terrible luck with Apache.
Apache is a pretty bad choice for a basic mostly static website
what do you suggest?
I tried lighttpd on Windows and it kept killing itself, not sure about unix
I use nginx, theres lighthttpd and some others which are even lighter but cant link to php/sql if neede
needed
hm
I've heard nginx was good
Its fast, pretty easy to setup and light on the ram and cpu
can you show me what its directory browsing looks like? :P
I dont have that turned on :P
I guess I can test it in a VM
Its got a module that should do it so
yeh
the only annoying thing about IIS is that I can't get .CGI stuff to work
CGI/Perl
I got PHP to work
php-fpm is a good one to use with nginx
is there a Windows build of nginx?
Looks like it
cool
I don't *have* to use IIS, but unlike apache, IIS didn't randomly crap out and die on me
and Apache, for some reason, would give people 56k speeds despite it being a 100mbps connection >_>
er *unlike lighttpd
Bad config
for which?
Whoever was geting bad speeds
oh
I have hit 100mpbs with nginx so meh
it was default Apache config
well
lighttpd and IIS went at the proper speed
apache had issues
but lighttpd would just stop working after a couple days
http://www.slashgear.com/fusion-io-releases-iofx-ssd-card-420gb-for-2495-12222607/
IIS let's you screw with MIME types, I had mine set so mp3s and such would open as binaries and bypass browser plugins :p
but I leik my chrome browser plugin playing
:<
EW QUICKTIME PLUGIN
I set all the A/V filetypes as octet-binary :P
http://www.veyka.co.uk/radios/
There, thats the directory viewer by default
No purty icons?
:<
DRF, my WIn7 doesn't have quicktime
So :P
It's the WMp plugin
i think.
No, no pwiddy icons
Its an auto indexer
What do you expect
brb
Can you add them:?:(
HML, either way, IE/Firefox open mp3s by default in a plugin
I set them as binaries so it prompts you to open/save instead :>

03the university computers, apparently, have both Office 2007 and OpenOffice
openoffice is dead, grab libreoffice
Stupid name but its more upto date
libreoffice
03it still sucks

03you can get portable Word 2000 for like 20MB
03Word AND Excel even
03in one exe
I told the computer department here to switch to Libre from open
Meh, its free, it works fine, and I dont have to mess about with cracking MS office
the newer laptops only have that :|
;-;
Yeh, cos open specifications are horrid(!)
03Office 2000 didn't have activation
03so no need to crack anything
03serials are easy as cake to find
eeyup
The last thing I want is moar MS crap, let alone old MS crap
03but non-MS crap is still crap :(
Meh

I tested it out on Openoffice
It refused to do it even if i did the 'copy image' rightclick

03hey, I like their chicken
03I hate hambugers period, regardless of where, but McDonald's chicken is actually good
10Their fries are good, but too greasy
03I love their fries
03they're now the best of the 3 since BK changed their recipe to make them "more healthy"
03>healthy
03>fries
03you're joking, right?
03so why not just keep them GOOD
03:P
10BK used to be my fav in terms of french fries
03exactly
03I think they were everybody's
10Wendy's are too salty now o.o
03but they changed their recipe like Wendy's did
03yeah
03Wendy's changed to sea salt or something
03I hate those
Yuck fries, chips should be thick and yummy
03I'll literally go there and just not order fries
Rather than so thin

03and BK's kinda suck too

7Well, same with me; expecting more information.
7Currently, there's no connection to the previous game, other than the fact it's set in the future. O.o
03I just don't care, at least until it's about a week away from being released :P
03or maybe out in Japan or something

why 	This is a Classroom License for instructional use only. 	Research and commercial use is prohibited. The bald and not excessively bald and not excessively smart hamster obeyed a terrified and not excessively terrified hamster. >> why
I LOL'd
since matlab lags so much
I literally typed it before it told me this is a classroom version
THAT'S NOT SYMBOLIC AT ALL
LOL, Rukario, this is your kind of assignment
QUESTION 1: [2 marks] With the help of the above examples, explain the role(s) of semi-colon, comma and space.
/me hides
err
Math.
but we have a lab portion involving Matlab
good bye
XD
XD
I wasn't asking for the answer
i have windows server 2008 to deal with
I was just saying it sounds like your assignments
x-x
now it's asking me why should you use windows dns instead of an open source program
o.o
i want to say "screw windows and use the open source"

"because the teacher said so"?
i lost respect for windows ever since that test tuesday
LOL what
completely ruined the fun of it
Your colleague at another company has installed DNS, but it is not mapping computer names to IP addresses. Which of the following might be the problem? (Choose all that apply.)
inb4 but Windows wasn't meant to be fun, it's SRS BSNS
a. DNS lookup zone records are not set up to update automatically, and your colleague has not manually created any records.
Rukario: f. Person screwed up.
b. There is no WINS-R zone.
c. The INIT records is missing.
inb4 "Blame Windows, end of story'
d. A single zone database can hold only 100 lookup records and there are over 100 records, so DNS has locked the zone.
drf XD
i'm just typing the question someplace so i can go back through the book and scan for it
so Rukario, I'm gonna be putting Windows Server 2008 on my dedicated server
instead of flipping back to the questions page
if you want the experience :P
I can let you play around with it LOL
i have windows server 2008
on an actual server though?
:P
like
with a domain name
to test the hosting and such
XD
drf you're a peadge
should i pm you here or there

lol
there is easier
as in, here

uhhh...
i'm soooo confused XD
We moved from the classroom to a computer lab
to work on the Matlab assignment
so I just popped mibbit up
hm
Create a 3 √ó 5 matrix of your choice where all entries are greater than one ,non-repeated, and non-integer. <- I'm assuming that means they should all be like, 0.5?
er
1.5
4hello!
1.1, 1.2, 1.25, 1.3, 1.32, 1.33, 1.34, 1.44442

I did that
just being lazy
god dang it Matlab
I hate how you need the * operator
if I type 4A, it doesn't understand. I have to type 4*a
any decent math operator should assume multiplication in something like that

Oh god the weeping angles
They scare the crap out of me
OK so LOL @ Engrish professors

also "3 command"
hi LL

urgh, are these commands backwards?
/me stabs math a few times
13Eww math
tell me about it
I type in A(2,7) and it returns a number that's 7 over, 2 down
now last I checked
it goes the other way around
you do X first, THEN Y?

hm
12o.o
I'll just word it like this
1. A(2,7) returns the value stored at position row 2 and column 7 in matrix A.
07aaaah
13tl;dr I become an umbreon at night cuz I be awesome like that c:
because in regular coordinates if you typed 2,7 it would be go OVER 2 then UP 7

07do I remember anything? no.

07:3
well I'm supposed to explain what some specific syntaxes do
and I can't really tell just from trying them LOL
07lol
and usually you can't like, reverse-lookup in the help
A(2,2:3:6) <- this, particularly
in a matrix called A
it returns two numbers
so wtf are the 3 and 6 doing
/me uses the pillow but still sleeps on Angel's head
07absolutely no idea |D

i need to open my windows server 2008
but i can't

he has a record of the last time the VM was modified and if it's different from what he has, we are done

Im in class..
as am I
lol
who are you talking to?
anyone?
oh lol
ah I think I finally figure it out
yep
4. A(2,2:3:6) returns the values in row 2, starting in column 2 and going through column 6. The 3 indicates that it should skip 3 values each time, in this case resulting in two values. In a later example such as A(2,2:3:10), it gives three values.
12o.o
12hai Danny
that took way too long to figure out.

6why would you cry in a corner?
it's an expression.
it basically means I'm sad

You are setting up a scope of addresses on a DHCP server between 138.90.10.2 through 138.90.10.99. However, you don‚Äôt want to have addresses 138.90.10.7 and 138.90.10.10 in the range of addresses to assign because these addresses are currently used for web servers. Which of the following is the best solution?

04I despise maths
i would redo the IP of the web servers

I don't mind *simple* math

I used to complain about algebra too but calc is much harder.
Your assistant reports that users cannot access the DHCP server to lease addresses. What troubleshooting measures do you take? (Choose all that apply.)
Ensure that the DHCP Client and DHCP Server services are started.
Make sure the DHCP server is connected to the network
ensure DHCP is configured with the nic binding

it's not C

Hi SS
I'm in Espa√±a, thus the Espa√±ol :P
03Wow
03nothing like sleeping in until 6:15M
03*PM
10Late
03yeah
03well considering yesterday I got less than 2 hours of sleep
03I kinda needed it
10Test tomorrow morning :<
03also for some reason I can't seem to get a "good night's sleep" anymore
03like
10I'm confident on English/Reading and somewhat Science
03I kept fricking waking up
03every 2-3 housr
03*hours
10Math is another story
03honestly
03the math on the ACT is not that bad
03nothing harder than algebra
10Well
07keep yourself up 24 hours then go back to sleep at a normal time lol
03since it's designed for everybody and some schools do algebra in like junior year
10Last year, Algebra II, had a bad teacher
03same her
03e
03but trust me
03there's nothing algebra II on there
03at least there wasn't when I took it
10The only thing I understood and could do well was matrices
10There is.
10Sin, cosin, etc.
10I don't know that stuff
03that's trig
03and well
03want a crash course?
/me runs
10w/e, we brushed upon it in Algebra II
03for us that was ac ompletely different class o.o
10I have this practice booklet for ACT
03algebra 2 was like the most retarded thing ever, I fail to see the point of such a class xd
03*D
03it was like LOL IMAGINARY NUMBERS
10>can't do half the problems
03If they're imaginary, why the f*** are you talkiung about the
03m
03etc
12O.o
10I took a practice one last year
10Math was my lowest score
03math was my highest score o.o
03also wtf
12I suck at maths too
10English/Reading was my highest
/me opens email, sees some creepy looking ad for Spirit Camera
/me 12glomps Pattyrick
03English was my lowest LOL
03but that being said, I'm an engineer, it only makes sense
10:P
10I like math, just takes me more time to understand it
oh?
aren't you doing compsci or IT now?
03I like math to a point
03what I hate is stupidly complicated math
03read: calculus
04explosions
10lolcalc
10Taking Precalc next year
04ohai Quan
06i understand math rather nicely but i despise it lol
03but they call it CSE
03computer science engineering
03o.o
lolwut
03granted it's not "real" engineering
i do CSE
03but I think like an engineer :P
Computer Systems Engineering
ORLY NAO
03I hate when everybod's like
03"You're an engineer? You must be good at math and science"
03I'm good at science but really? why math?
10Stereotypes
03engineering is all about efficiency, isn't it?
10They exist.
03well
because engineers work a lot with math?
10http://pw0nd.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/StereotypesCops-500x400.jpg
03universities themselves stereotype then :P
04"Hey, you're a smart kid, why don't you like science?"
03akd L[a]korv, depends on what type
03engineering is a really broad area
03XD
03funny thing is that I do like science
inb4 Mythbusters
03I just hate when science and math merge (read: university physics)
03as that's entirely calculus
03and I despise calculus
03but Physics 1 in high school was my favorite class
Spanish stereotype: food is like Mexican; truth: Very different
10imagine AP calc
03purely conceptual physics is awesome
03I *had* AP calc
10oh?
03our school didn't have a non-AP calc
10Sucks for you
03it was the same class
Happy friday guys :)
03oddly enough
03I actually got an A in it
03as I had a really good teacher
03who explained it
12whoa
03in college, they just expect you to figure it out -_-
10Professors won't assist you if you need help?
03depends on who
10eh
03at U of M, the class wasn't even taught by professors
And to you.
03it was taught by these Asian grad students
03who didn't write the exams
0,14oh hai Meanwhile
03I was so pissed
10I think that's part of their job, either way
Allo.
10They're supposed to teach you
03because they would quite literally teach things that weren't on the exam and vice versa
10Not go, "You don't know this, no help for you"
03the exam was written by the math department, class was taught by grad students, >_>
12ugh
inb4 YOU SHALL NOT PASS (unless you go to tutorials)
03at this school I can get help yeah
03In fact I slightly LOL'd
03my programming teacher
10tutors
03was like "cheating is very serious, if you need help, please don't ask other people to avoid plagirism. Just email me your code and I'll help"
03I should totally challenge accepted sometime
12lol
03LOL @ some spam emails
03"African Love Express"
03yeah no thanks
I love spam like that
03"Free Cams" <- would be good if it were true
/me runs
10if you're desperate enough
So bad, almost good
/me hides
03well
03I'm smart enough to know not to click stuff like that :P
12lololol wut
03desperate and smart aren't really related
/me hides
12I'm tempted when there's stuff like "free bag of Skittles" and "free Coca-Cola sample"
12but I know it's spam
03I generally avoid free offers unless they're on Woot
03as those tend to be legit
12never heard of that
03it's a "one deal each day" site
03but there's a community page where people share offers
6http://princess-bonnibel-bubblegum.tumblr.com/post/21043194913?og=1&fb_action_ids=431910466824849&fb_action_types=tumblr-feed%3Alike&fb_source=other_multiline&ref=nf
03and they only really make the main page if enough people validate that it's legit
03LOL Aurora
03http://cheezcomixed.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/3cbb26d0-4207-4cbc-859c-2aab880e9a1e.jpg
I never take any Internet offers seriously unless they're actually from an official website or if I've actually heard of it elsewhere
03so, this is just great
03my laptop's hard drive is broken
03not completely but it's got a couple bad sectors
inb4 green eggs & ham

03well yeah, that movie is terrible
Great. I'm getting bondage email. AGAIN.

12I haven't seen Destiny Deoxys

04o-o
I also liked Zorkark
Oh look, I'm female.
I wrote a clopfic for all the people organizing the brony uk convention :P

Clopfics that aren't serious and for a joke are hillarious
RAWRity, finished the MeanwhileXTrixie clopfic?
03I gave up after the Shaymin one

I just don't know.
I was in town today wearing a brony shirt today and some random guy came up to me and said "Oi you, brony fuck. Get a life you gay prick" I didn't know how to react to that so i just carried on walking :P

It's surprisingly easy to forget just how manic mane chat is on movie night.
Dat saddle sweat
07by 'finding' you mean reposting from sites that he visits a lot |D
03though it gets annoying when I'll browse the sites on my own and then they share it a day later and I'm like "I've seen this already"
I would record me shouting "it's friday night" But there are people sleeping
RAWRity, that sounded like Mr. Bill
friday the 13th is best friday
StinkomanFan: you misunderstand! His lady love is trixie, and I am merely trying to express their love into words!

Gaben is sexy

He said he liked ponies?
GabeMoist: I'll get to work on that fic right away.
RAWRity: Please, make that one your priority.
don't think I recall, care to pick me up to speed about gabe?
Stinkomanfan, I don't need to watch a movie about how a man can punch out 25 battle-hardened criminals to know I'm manly.
0,5Hehe, kidding
nooo we still need Meanwhile X Trixie

ooh! Idea! Meanwhile and Trixie pair up with LordCelestia and Gabe Newell for a Double Date!

The plot is atrociously bad.
How about an Adventure TIme MLP crossover? http://i.imgur.com/sfeud.jpg
Dermathil, turn off your poor excuse of a brain and just enjoy it
nice one RAWRity
>buys appletv and ipod
If it weren't midnight I'd scream.
/me is best pony
03both of which I had a REASON to get
I LOVE APPLE
I DEFEND IT
Dermathil: what's bad about it.
Midnight is the best time to scream
i buy a PC
/me hides
03and not "I'm going to buy an iPod because I'm cool"
:(
Yikes, I just stood up and I felt like I was going to pass out
If I screamed at midnight I'd give myself away to whoever I'm following down a dark path.
Midnight_Fyre: I hate it when that happens >.<
Dermathil, Name me one action movie that's plot wasn't to be awesome
Meanwhile: Oh don't worry, trixie already knows you're there.
ONE
Inception's whole plot wasn't only to be awesome.
Props for thinking inside the chimney RAWRity.
I had minor surgery this morning and I've been full of anestesia and painkillers all day
so I'm guessing all the antagonist in die hard movies are germans?
HA
Dermathil: It kinda was.
this movie is great
dat Friday the 13th lag
makes me lightheaded
inb4 all civilians are killed
It was partly awesome, and that's all that counts
Dken2021, Seems to be.
Indeed, via dreamscape they had an excuse to go to as many crazy places as they wanted.
no it wasn't. It was also a metaphor about how a filmmaker can manipulate its audience through suspension of disbelief.
Bronystate Regulars is one of the only Partly civilized rooms during streams
04I wanted an iPod because of touch screenz
04But it's so damn buggy
And how many people went to watch it for that reason Dermathil.
another Friday 13th?
so basically what Dermathil is complaining about is that Die Hard commits the unforgivable sin of being an action movie.
They could of just sent in one guy with a gun to find and kill Die Hard. That's all it would of taken. Jesus these guys are stupid...
Jaketehsnake we can change that ~
Bronystate regulars is civilaized
Who REALLY sat down and decided to see Inception because of the underlying messgae.
BEWBS
To the moooon
Oh Hai T. How long have you been here?
didn't we just have a Friday 13th like january or february?
Usually, but when we go uncivilized we REALLY go uncivilized :P
TheGreatAndPowerfulT is always here. Lurking. Watching. Waiting...
I went to see it because it had some intellect hidden inside, which is something this movie lacks entirely.
Dermathil, I would have given you Blade Runner, I would have given you Minority Report, I would have given you HEAVY RAIN! But you went with the Cliche answer
Jaketehsnake long before you ~ but i'm pro at lurking
04Everytime I sync it several of my albums have copies
Hans_Gruber: you missed em
04and then when I delete one it deletes BOTH albums
03LOL SYNCING
why was i kicked holy crap
you see Meanwhile get's the idea
03on my Zune, I set it to "never sync anything, ever, for any reason"
where are his shoes?
03and then I just manually add stuff
Stinkomanfan, thanks for mentionning Blade Runner. That movie is in my top 5 movies of all time. I just didn't think about it.
kenne: dude, sorry about earlier
Bronies are ot a civilised people
Out of interest TheGreatAndPowerfulT, what're you waiting for?
otakon: lolwut?
also, WHERE DID HE GET THE GUN
TheGreatAndPowerfulT, I am too, but it isn't fun. Its like being pro at holding in a fart: Its doable, but there is no reason to want to do it
Allo otakon.
Dermathil: he's a cop, he had one on him.
otakon arnt you supposed to be eating
Dermathil he had it on him
He's a cop
kenne: for giving you grief on how you were playing, that's all. I'm sorry.
Is Die Hard super intelligent existential film trying to say something without saying it, but that doesn't in any way make it bad. It's a simple, straightforward action film with good acting, clever writing, and superb acting. And that's all it's supposed to be.
uh oh lag EVERYPONY PANIC
curse you lag!
no reason you can't eat and chat at the same time
*Die Hard isn't
04I cbf to do that
otakon: dont you do that everytime though?
>Good Acting
Good acting AND superb acting RAWRity
?Suerb acting
/me is best pony
Meanwhile nothing in particular i just don't talk much unless the topic hold my interest
Redundant acting.
Hint: He's the Japanese guy
Snapes says NEIN
kenne: I don't usually get so aggravated about it though, I'm sorry for yelling at you.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Your attention must not be easily held.
Hans, by the end of this movie you won;t be
My headphones just unplugged and then it soumded as ifpeople are being raped
StinkomanFan silence you foal!
Rawrity, those movies merely aren't the type of movie I like watching. Which is why I'm going to go see "Cabin in the Woods" in a few weeks.
hello RX-78-3-SweetieBot
oh no wonder i am lagging steam decided to start downloading something now
Hey otakon, I picked up a Batarian sentinel, they do punch like battle tanks don't they.
hallo
Alan Rickman makes me squee with delight
otakon: i cant tell hen you yell yell and when you koke yell anymore, it all sounds the same. either way its nothin
Meanwhile: yes
I mean, I literally punched down a Geth Prime with full armour with him.
ohai otakon
somepony said Cabin in the Woods.
/me hugs RX-78-3-SweetieBot
kenne: well, still I shouldn't have acted like that
I did Tovler
Ohai RX-78-3-SweetieBot
RX-78-3-SweetieBot: how you been man? you missed my rage
oatakon is in always yell mode
Is that guy Lucius Malfoy?
lol
ohai RX-78-3-SweetieBot
Meanwhile no
Rage at what this time?
Meanwhile ohh it varies depending on my mood
0,14eeenope, it's Snape
Dermathil, nopony's FORCING you to watch this but yourself
it sounds like an insanely good intellectual movie.
They say Cabin in the Woods is good, then again, they said the same thing about Drag Me To Hell, and that movie was horrible.
hooray lag is gone now
SaxyPretender: oh my god you're right. Damnit.
Okay, I'm here.
Hi all.
dat Friday 13th lag
Allo Randomnerd.
Tovler, it was compared to inception
Tovler: Moviebob said Cabin in the Woods was a must see. Just saying
^
otakon: again man, itsn nothin dont think about it
hai there Randomnerd
I have no lag atall Hans_Gruber
Tovler: what is Cabin about man? I see computer screens and some scenes with what I think are B.O.W.s
I just gave up on watching the movie. I've seen it before, I'm here for the conversation.
Gumri silence you foal!
The lag became unbearable.
People will keep mentioning Inception until something 'better' comes along
True.
I've never seen Inception, I hear it's good.
Note the quotes around better
odd, I'm not experiencing lag, and I got a wonky wi-fi connection
otakon: I liked the costumes.
Inception is good
otakon: a gang of 5 college students go have fun in a cabin in the woods and something is manipulating their environment through high tech surveillance systems.
otakon its some genre bending horror movie. that's all I know about it.
ah
Dermathil!
It is not a horror movie
Call my name when Shaun of the Dead starts.
/me hugs Dermathil "How you been man?"
Dermathil: sure
otakon: you've never seen Inception?
I been okay
That one guy dressed in mad style.
What kind of hole do you live in.
no Meanwhile I haven't
He missed the week we streamed it
From what I can tell, Cabin in the Woods is a horror comedy
Meanwhile: Hurlock
My non-brony Ultra-sheltered and Naive friend is reading Fallout Equestria. He is having a really hard time accepting that The amin character is lesbian
inception was boooring
just when I said no lag, it just lagged
mmmmmmmBreakfast sandwiches
see if yoyu can find all 12 ninjas in this scene?
/me nomz otakon
Jaketehsnake: wait.......he's struggling that she's a LESBIAN!?
I wish I could pretend to know what you just said Jaketehsnake.
I honestly don't get the hype over Inception. It was OK, but nothing that special
/me hasn't seen Die Hard
The joke is Lesbianism
:p
Joseph Gordon-Levitt, that's his name. God, he looks great in that movie.
My name buzzed because you said that Midnight_Fyre
xD
I hear thats a great place to live StinkomanFan
Midnight_Fyre: thatsthejoke.targa
Meanwhile: he's non-brony friend is reading FO: E and his friend is struggling to grasp that Littlepip is a lesbian.
/me reads any given comments section and loses faith in humanity.
Afternoon Regulars room :)
otakon: Yeah see I ignored FO: E
I wonder if Derm has even seen this movie all the way through :s
Howdy LunaTheBeloved.
/me hugs LunaTheBeloved. "Allo"
Doesn't explain how it's so high on IMDb's top 250 list though
Hey Luna

LunaTheBeloved I mean
lali-ho LTB
Thatssss a very nice sssuit you ahve ther
How's it going?
The numbers, tekagi, What do they mean!
otakon, He is Mormon and very very sheltered. He had to confirm with me twice that lilpip was a girl. Then hes all like "Why does she like Velvet then???"
would be a ssshame if sssomething where to happen to it
Midnight_Fyre, graphics supposedly
Sorry, LuLu :(

NICE SHOT
ded
*nomz
Poor bastard :(
We need some moon pies in here.
I'll admit it has good visuals, but it takes a lot more than that to impress me in a movie
otakon, How do i explain it to him gently?
I've heard "The Cabin In The Woods" described as "Evil Dead" meets "The Truman Show"
Inception was overhyped because it was "intelligent compared to all the other stupid popcorn flicks."
/me nomz IshBestPony hello!
I loved The Evil Dead!
My local Convenience store has moon pies
/me nomz SunderlandPony89
Jaketehsnake: Some people are attracted to people the same gender. *shrug*
Tovler: This.
And Evil Dead 2 was even cooler!
Evil Dead is rad.
Evil Dead II was awesome
about 20% cooler?
0,14EvilDead III was my first movie here
Every man wants to be Bruce Campbell.
Even morso
Meanwhile, I accept that. I haven't told him yet, He is reall confused. How do I break it to him?
Jaketehsnake: say that.
mai first movie was Time Travelers Wife
Say she's gay
Jaketehsnake: give him a live demonstration
SaxyPretender: you hear they're making Evil Dead 4? and it's not by Sam Raimi?
That was awful
That's it
brb
0,14...Yeah, i did
Jaketehsnake: the more you play it down the easier it is to grasp.
My first full movie was House (I saw the end of Twister)
My first movie was Mulan. Man, I'm old.
0,14I wish I didn't
RAWRity BLASPHEMY
0,14but i did
This was the first movie I ever saw
Mfw I've been here longer than SaxyPretender.
I'm gonna have to jog my memory and look at the list, I cannot remember for sure.
my first film was, funnily enough, Inception
Whats that? Send him chapter 20.5 you say?
0,14Indeed, you have Meanwhile
Way to make me feel ancient by comparison.
0,14I still remember blenders and Octavia's plot
I have a feeling that my first movie was the wickerman but im not sure about tat
^
Dat plot.
The first movie I EVER saw was this one right here.
The first movie I ever remember seeing is Bambi :'(
First one I saw was Scott Pilgrim
You guys wanna feel old? When somebody says "A decade ago" you still think of the 90s
BUt the first movie I've ever seen on here?
The first movie I saw here was Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
/me sighs
RAWRity, ....Damn...
Tovler they never streamed bambi did they
/me also sighs
Octavia's plot? Do I want to know?
Oh, god... RAWRity, you have described my life.
RAWRity: I heard that a few days ago :p
damnit RAWRity
RAWRity: Oh lord. . . You're right.
10Left side of mouth is sore again
FUCKING LAG!!!
10>wisdom teeth
First film I ever saw on here was SPACEBALLS
I am the dinosaur.
Midnight_Fyre: We used to have a mod called Octavia, the joke was that her plot was the size of a planet.
IshBestPony: no
03o.o
Tovler then thats not your first movie here
And Blenders........Still never got mine....
Meanwhile: eeyup, and then she got Plot cancer...
He mad
I remember Octavia. I've been around that long. Just don't know anything about Octavia's plot
LunaTheBeloved: You didn't? I'm sure I posted everyone at least 5.
*suprised keanu face* 20 years ago, it was the 90s
Magically gone
Is it bad that thinking of Octavia's plot makes me feel nostalgia?
RAWRity.... akward :s
0,14awww hell, I'm feeling good
/me hugs everyone
who's this octavia I'm hearing?
funfact: octavia the mod was the one who NAMED octavia the pony.
I remember poking her plot
/me hugs SaxyPretender back.
/me hugs back :3
Tovler: Animaniacs is 19 years old
03did you get them removed?
T'was nice
/me nomz Meanwhile
hiya Dken2021
/me hugs SaxyPretender
10Nope
lol
03oh
lali-ho otaykon
I remember, now... It was "The Time Traveler's Wife"! I didn't realize it was a movie block, and missed "Plan 9".
07,01Animaniacs is awesome
10Plan to this summer though
^
03you prolly need to at some point then?
I remember doing...more than poking it. *ahem*
07,01just saying
03ah
It is :)
Luna: it IS!
How old is Garfield now?
/me hugs Luna "
It most certainly is.
Animaniacs isgreat
10It'll hurt
07,01might stream a ep or two later
I never sync my sansa
10or so I have been told
yay!
StinkomanFan: 22 Years, now
that was random Luna
10many, many times
/me hugs Little Sister Luna
10:/
Octavia is also one of the Ohio bronies (like myself).
Garfield's 35ish
StinkomanFan: The comic strip started in '78
07,01Also.. what do you guys think of the vids being displayed before BMN?
if theres one thing that always bugs me
because my mp3 collection is larger than the disk
and > Rockbox
So
03I don't even think I have wisdom teeth
Midnight_Fyre I am also an Ohio Brony
I prefer manual
03inb4 jokes about my intelligence
is bullets dont spark, when will hollywood learn this
Luna: I get the message, but I'm personally not interested.
Luna: informative
I missed em...
Luna I'm fine with them.
I mean, that cat is not only fat HE'S OLD
Cool. What part of Ohio?
0,5What were the videos?
10That's right, you are stupid
I would preferif they were pony...
Columbus
03also wtf? syncing sansas? They're supposed to show up as a hard drive, how would you even sync it o.o
/me runs
UnFoundBug, Never, It ruins chances for explosions, which they love
exactly
but
the mformative videos? don't mind
Luna: No idea, what were they?
if there was software
The only thing I remember about the 00s is Chappelle's show and The Boondocks.
Ah, I'm up east of Cleveland
from Sandisk
*informative
but bullets can't cause explosions
LordCelestia: stuff on the further assault on liberty and freedom on the internet
Good thing nopony was stupid enough to make Die Hard into a video game :s
and explosions dont involve that much fire
UnFoundBug: So then it's an unfound bug for hollywood?
Ah Chappelle's show.....good times...
I used to live in Columbus though and I hope to miove back eventually
0,5Speaking of bullets, there was a gunfight in my city today
Where's the fun in not making explosions.
03OK WTF
UnFoundBug: it's used in order to allow the audience to see the action more clearly. There's just certain liberties you take when making a film in order to make it easier to follow.
03I'm running memtest on my dedicated server
My grandparents are living in cleavland right now.
03it shows only 2GB of RAM
StinkomanFan: Don't look now...
03I paid for 4
StinkomanFan: actually it was a game
03>_>
How was it?
LordCelestia: Oh my.
LordCelestia oh my, hope you werent near that
yes cause c4 burns like petrol, and bullets spark off metal etc
LordCelestia: How did it end?
Cl,eveland is kinda fun
0,5Nah I was in school, watching the story develop
YFW they're making Die Hard 5
/me nomz LordCelestia and Luna
\I guess
late ded
LordCelestia: What happened??
LordCelestia: woah
I remember it being good actually but it was when i was a little kid
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Hard_%28video_game%29
I need to watch VH1's I love the 00s. I remember nothing about that decade.
lotta typos from me today
I thought they already made Die Hard 5
0,14I thought Die Hard 5 was the one with Justin long
Midnight_Fyre: The lag doesn't help.
That was 4
StinkomanFan: nope, Die Hard 4 was with Justin Long
ohai santa
Tovler, Big Mouth Billy Bass
0,14oh
0,5Well some guy was going out of a store with a semi-automatic weapon shooting at somebody
UnFoundBug: All explosions being gasoline explosions is the one thing about movies that REALLY bug me
TAKE ME TO THE RIVER
I have that game for the NES
DROP ME IN THE WATER
Die Hard 5 will be called "A Good Day To Die Hard". not even joking.
They are still making 5
I hear
StinkomanFan: it that the singing robot fish thingy?
actual explosions are so much more impressive than the holywood rubbish
crazy people these days

Best line in the film probably
Jerking you off on a radio, Hawt

Kosoveon, you are a 7Rattata.
/me kicks back with a stolen leg to continue movie watching.
man, you do one of 2 things, watch chat or watch stream, you can't do both
StinkomanFan, 70's motherfucker do you remember it?
StinkomanFan: Puts a lot of things in perspective, doesn't it.
Regenald VelJohnson is not a mere stereotype, dummy.
UnFoundBug you missed cheap gas prices
UnFoundBug: First world bronystate problems
And yes, it sucks ;P
i even have 2 monitors so i dont even have to tab
Hell, I am 14 and I remember that shit
UnFoundBug I know
Why do you guys call it gas and yet it's a liquid?
Because that's how they roll
gasoline
short for gasoline
Gumri its shorthand for Gasoline
gasoline just short
/me tattoos the words "Trixie is my Waifu" on Meanwhile's upper arm.
which is still no excuse
of course it is :P
0,5Holy jesus
but yeah it's stupid... they seem to like stupid things
0,14that's redundant
/me roundhouse kicks RAWRity with LTB's leg.
Should just call it petrol
0,5Just realized that there was a gas tank truck that was near the gunfire
FUCKING LAG!!!
Diesel is also a petrol
/me counterkicks LunaTheBeloved's leg back to them.
0,5If that thing exploded... O__O
/me feels the pain in her leg
Unleaded petrol and diesel petrol
StinkomanFan: he wants a tiny Trixie figure.
Sorted!

StinkomanFan: I have no idea.

/me steals and nomz teh leg
LordCelestia: Gunfire doesn't set off gas
/me cuts Meanwhile's leg
Everybody get Meanwhile a Trixie Lulamoon brushable pony
/me jabs RX-78-3-SweetieBot in the head with his leg stump.
LordCelestia it wouldnt though, its the fumes that burn, and in a tank there is no oxygen
petrol = gasoline actually :)
/me takes and eats Meanwhile's leg
Silly Meanwhile, you can't hurt a robot
It would leak and start a fire eventually, but no instantaneous BOOOOOOOOOOMM
Jaketehsnake asuming a spark
LunaTheBeloved: Owowowowow whyyyyy
They can't feel pain
LordCelestia: Mythbusters proved that shooting a gas tank wont set it off
Just anger
UnFoundBug, Indeed. Assuming a spark
StinkomanFan: It's the thought that counts!
Meanwhile, you hurt mine with that kick!
LunaTheBeloved: he was drawing on me!
/me kicks RAWRity with Meanwhile's leg
Then he falls to his death *roll credits*
aaaaand his hands still work fine. ._.

I would go and get some noms but i am enjoying this film
/me bonks LunaTheBeloved with the stump end of her own leg.
oh look, Meanwhile x Trixie is still a discussion point
I approve of this
/me gets double pain
We can calculate how much strain was on his hands. His massxacceleration 220lbsx 9.8 m/s Squared. Then applies to the surface of his hands. A lot of pressure
Dken2021, close enough
/me slaps ScootaChicken with LunaTheBeloved's leg.
/me nomz LunaTheBeloved and Meanwhile's legs
/me kicks RAWRity and then Meanwhile
oh god his ears
/me hops in ghosting limb induced pain.
Slowly Meanwhile sauntered over to otakon, twirling his moustache seductively.
0,14Man, lots of kicking going on in here
Look at all that /me and its...stuff.
/me won't be able to catch teh lottery tommorrow
/me pokes SaxyPretender

SaxyPretender: no kicking from me, just tattooing
What's that Meanwhile? You want me to post the rest of that fic?
/me spinning kicks Meanwhile after ScootaChicken
Well if you insist...
/me makes a sound that someone makes when they are poked
/me throws his remaining Taco Bell food into the audience

/me won't be able to catch teh lottery tommorrow
I need to be able to get away with being under 16 in August. How can i make myself look young?
/me paddles back to shore with LunaTheBeloved's leg.
/me kicks all the /me
dat Officier Winslow
UnFoundBug: That's what I was thinking
hiya ScootaChicken how are you?
dont even shoot to hit it
Gumri: take lessons from me
otakon: Decent
the shots fired would call in all the hot stuff
/me punches LunaTheBeloved's leg in the knee.
/me feels the water on her leg
OW!
He Shot a Kid
Gumri trying to avoid something?
/me crumples over
UnFoundBug: yeah, but McClane isn't going to shoot at a fellow officier
/me stabs Meanwhile's leg with a knife
AIYYAAA.
String_Shredess: Kaleel White?
otakon: He should just fire out the window then
/me bashes LunaTheBeloved's leg on a rock.
otakon: eeyup
Jaleel White's in dancing ?
Yippee kai ayy motherfucker
And then Meanwhile was Link
Owowowowowow!
Erm i am going to try and get at a hotel so that 3 people can stay in the same room
SunderlandPony89: still a chance it'll hit someone
No cavalry. Sorry
otakon dont shoot to hit it
even just near it missing deliberately
/me breaks Meanwhile's leg in half
/me passes out from the pain.
Gumri: Has this got anything to do with BUCK?
Expecting Cavalry? TOO BAD WALUIGI TIME
UnFoundBug: you NEVER shoot to not hit something, that's a good way to hit someone
FREEZE MOTHERFUCKER
ScootaChicken: yes it has. I am intending to share a room with a panda and a drunk
/me steals her leg back
otakon: Its that or everyone in that room risks death, and those are some pretty bad odds of that actually happening
/me remains unconcious on the beach.
Denegoth
Either way, I feel so, so sorry for you
/me gives Meanwhile his two leg halves back
lolWinslow
/me sighs
/me revives Meanwhile
Gumri: Don't get raped, being on a train with him for 2 and a half hours was bad enough
IshBestPony :D
pew pew
Fortunately I had Ronsta as a barrier between him and me, but it was still terrifying
That's one strong ass gun
quip
I didn't hesitate.
UnFoundBug: you still NEVER shoot something unless you mean to hit something
Denegoth is a crazy fucker :D
NOW TAKE HIS GUN
NOW KISS
thats why you aim to hit something loud
NOW IM A MARE
Gumri: I love him so much.
/me reattaches his leg and flicks LunaTheBeloved in the head on his way back to the movie.
You ass, everything is wrong
that'll get his attention
Suddenly body
run winslow run
LOL! Nice!
/me jumps and pokes Meanwhile back

Car Phones are best phones

I picked Justin Bieber: Never Say Never for A and B.
0,14...
0,14no
Tovler: good man
TOVLER NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Tovler: ...no words
This pain medication I'm taking today (cuz of surgery this morning) is making me really lightheaded so I'm having trouble paying attention
Bloop
to that's me, ScootaChicken and Tovler who chose that!
WHHHHHHHHHHHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYyy
b for bad a for assy
okay...
HONK
Tovler:|
Never Say Never for A movie?
:)
bwahahaha
Ive picked Ferris Bueller for A for months now....
Dken2021 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I have never deliberately missed a movie night, but if that wins, I will.
^
not any more your not!
RAWRity: /) bieberhoof?
0,14brb, dinner
so we've got three people going with Bieber! I like dem odds
Something not eye bleed inducing for A and B movie?
/me is wubbed :3
ScootaChicken: trollhoof /)
Hugo Foar A movie
That works
although I admit to picking Surf Ninjas for B everytime too XD
If RAWRity wins with Never say Never I say we have him permabanned
Downfall for A movie
RAINBOW
^^
^
there wll be so many people in the main room screaming
although RAWRity, I couldn't bring myself to vote Biebe as B as well, so I voted Life of Brian as B
Has anyone not seen me after I shaved my goatee?
Bronystates gonna be crowded thanks to the Wedding. Just Bieber has to win.
Midnight_Fyre: I second that!
nope
Hiiiiii terrorist!
Midnight_Fyre Hey, you can't ban me for not having done anything wrong.
05,15Life of Brian!
...We need The Wedding Crashers for A
Dat acting.
Someponies getting hitched
Someponies getting hitched
this guy ^
There is EVERYTHING wrong with picking that movie
Rango or Hugo foar A movie
who are you?
I think he wants to hurt you
RAWRity: Picking Never Say Never is the worest offence someone can make
Worst*
Au contraire SunderlandPony89, LIKING Never Say Never...
04probably a vore
SunderlandPony89: I've not broken any rules
http://i.imgur.com/TYhmn.png
Just in case.
vore?
I'm never gonna get A or B, so I have nothing to lose for picking the Biebs.
Meanwhile: just in case http://i.imgur.com/ja107h.jpg
Never Say Never the first A movie to be WMC?
RAWRity: You broke a moral code. Which is worse that a Bronystate movie night
dat stache
dat shaven Meanwhile
dat 'stache
Dken2021 that movie is no A
RAWRity, it wouldn't work. It's not an A movie, it's a B with its Critical reviews
:p
If Never got picked for a movie, BroState would have a very small populace for a time.
My moostashe!
isnt that movie a high budjet?
vore vore vore
StinkomanFan: actually, It has a fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes
Meanwhile: Still lookin' gooood!
Meanwhile, You['re Mustache] Ignites strange feelings
Dken2021: 13 mil dollar budget
PONIES!
10Whoever approved of their vhost, wtf.
Ponyys
That's pretty low budget
so sorta
/me gets ALL the chatgoers.
thats alot of wasted money
SunderlandPony89: still qualifies for A movie.
Halloween 2007 is A, therefore Bieber is A movie.
RAWRity: If I win Never Say Never for A and you win it for B we might just have one of the most brilliant moments of trolling in the history of BronyState
where are these people's shoes?
Nay, the internet
Bieber is A because... its Bieber :p
someone should get rid of that vhost.
No lag, not now
/me steals Meanwhile's leg
B stands for Bieber.
:P
ScootaChicken: my B is called "Nudist Colony of the Dead"
Don'y do it!
04Why is it that I mention vore Ponies comes up?
aww John made a friend! FRIENDSHIP LELVEL UP

RAWRity: Ok, now THAT'S an awesome sounding B movie
IshBestPony: eenope, Bieber's A. I did my research, and I'm silling to defend it.
/me stumbles onto one leg and hope after LunaTheBeloved. "I thought we were filmgoing!"
maybe
But that sounds brilliant as well
stupid USB adapter went screwy AGAIN
The Social Network for A?

Meanwhile, its not a BMN without some leg stealing :3
IshBestPony: eenope.
No more Asylum movies please. I barely survived Titanic II
well this is surprising... not
RAWRity eeyup
Jaketehsnake: Isn't Transmorphers made by the same people who made Titanic 2?
nooo bad buffer wheel
HAHA, it's actually a Terminator knock-off Jaketehsnake!

If computers had surrond sound, then Transformers would be a nice A
Dont forget to take pics

SweetieBot probably B
What is the difference between the LAPD and the feds?
RX-78-3-SweetieBot: B probably
03so Xanbreon I'm running memtest on my dedi and it's only showing 2GB of RAM despite it supposedly having 4
03is that usual?
LAPD is a police department, Feds are the FBI
No clue, why are you memtesting it?
^
Kamen Rider, thats already been picked
Gumri: LAPD is city law enforcement, Feds is from the National government
03for lulz
03because I can't really do anything with the vKVM console
03I need to wait for them to write back about Windows Server
3RX-78-3-SweetieBot, do you mean the Kamen Rider: The First movie?
Ahh
SlurryMoon: no
Do they have different things then or what?
3ah

And national government tends to equal stupidity

I was thinking about either OOO 21 medals or Decade allriders vs daishocker

Everything makes stupidity if given enough time
What about one of the "Giant Shark VS Mega Octopus" Movies?

RAWRity if you're picking Bieber for A, I'm picking Sharktopus foar A
/me feels the movement, but is only ticklish in one place, and that 'aint it.

Fun fact: The higher people are in authority, the bigger asshole they become

Must suck for that to be the last thing to hear before you die
Green Isn't Your Colour is an epic episode
SunderlandPony89, Does that make you angry that I picked it?
SQUEAL LIKE A PIG
Green isn't your colour is the best episode if you ask me!
I've seen it 4 times. IT'S SO OLD!
Don't the pony episodes need 2 weeks before they're viewable again?
Green Isn't Your Colour is overused.
ohai Urkel
Like Party of One and Lesson Zero
Only 4 times?
Jaketehsnake: Yes you damn troll
Green Isn't Your Color is nice, but we've watched it on here like 5 times
Guys, you do realize there are OTHER EPISODES right?
I am surprised Sonic rainboom isn't overplayed

Slowly Meanwhile sauntered over to otakon, twirling his moustache seductively. 'You know, now that you've shaved, your actually kind of cute' Meanwhile whispered lovingly in the other man's ear. Otakon buried his face in his arms, both out of shame and guilt for his infidelity to his true love, daribot, and out of a burning passion for the British man and his fabulous moustache.
Who is this cute pegasister at school supposed to be then?

Pinkie is also beyond Thunderdome.....
Pinkie Pie is self-aware of her state as a cartoon pony.
Yeah, these cards just got leaked this week.

This old Skype is messed up on Linux.
INFECTED!
I love the British attitude to swearing, no one gives a buck about it
so MUCH redundacy
otakon: it's a call, a skype call.
The word 'cunt' is punctuation in Scotland.
SO MUCH REDUNDACY in this movie
Hype: You mean they do in other countries :O
ScootaChicken: I know
English
Without a doubt
05,15Like I said. It's Britain, people are going to say fuck a lot
Hype: I don't really like the word 'cunt'. Doesn't stop me from using it all the time though XD
ugh, apparently my connection's so bad I have to use lightirc
English people swear all the time
05,15My god the british sure like to swear
I swear all the time IRL
Ditto
Same
Polite conversation? Fuck.
'fuck' is pretty much a comma
Angry conversation? Fuck cunt bollocks shit wanker.
05,15[SHAUN]thehated5689 just watch The Inbetweeners, it'll sum it up for you
and 'dickhead' is a compliment
I rarely swear in real life, but I swear online all the time
E.g, 'allfuckingright, mate? How's it fucking going with you?'
Casual conversation? Fuck bollocks shit wanker.
In England cunt is considered a joke word :D
HOW DOES HE NOT NOTICE THIS!?
I would notice this shit!
In some circles 'cunt' is a term of affection
otakon: he's really fucking jaded.
otakon: he slept against a fridge.
0,14I've only used the c-word, ONCE, and that was to describe my ex after she said something about someone I knew that was dying
otakon: hes half asleep and miserable at the moment

Let me rephrase that then. Can't get full automatic weapon without a special permit
Everlasting_Joy: There was a massacre in a primary (Re: elementary) school in 1996 in Dunblane Scotland using handguns
So the parliament clamped down on the laws
03brb
fluttercry and Hype Ah, I see.
Shaun KING OF THE ZOMBIES!
Hype: a primary school?
Damn.
damn straight
Yeah, a primary school
oh look
Hype: who was the shooter?
Hopefully not one of the students
damn RX-78-3-SweetieBot should have know you knew that, considering your a gunsmith and all.
It's the general public
05,15An older Scout leader
Thomas Hamilton, they don't know what his motives were
RX-78-3-SweetieBot: HOW? They haven't made a weaponized laser yet have they?
05,15all the victims were 5-6 year olds, and one teacher
I liek guns :3
But he killed a lot of kids and a teacher
that poor teacher
otakon: not one that works effciently for cost and size
RX-78-3-SweetieBot: oh
The shooter killed himself
worse than a cell going of in a movie theatre
but there are plenty of killer lasers. they just giant and use a LOT of power
interesting
