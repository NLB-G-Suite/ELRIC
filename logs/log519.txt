There's no such thing as a bad anime or manga.
Because lots of the context and emotion of the anime is lost when a english dib is created.

Whoops I twitched and clenched my fist
i can still talk
You know whats a really poor edit in One peice?
hello?
Yes, the characters in animes are bound to their voices. They lose a lot of that in english dubs.

These bullets are the size of artillary shells and very expensive, yet they shoot them like nothing
I'm okayish
The fuck 4 kids!

HEY EVERYPONY! :)
I don't get why 4kids keeps dubbing violent anime...
there are English dubs that are on par/better than the japanese+subs
Why the shit would you remove the reason a character went missing!
I mean, One Piece, seriously?
Though they don't own it anymore
This is why you either BUY the anime DVDs or watch online folks. Never watch anime on terrestrial tv

HIYA EVERYPONY
Look at dat swager
Though I like Yu-Gi-Oh 5D's opening...it's really good.
You know its bad when they drop a character for no reason when its been edited out
Does anyone know the name of that blue haired chick from one peice?
I forget the girl's name... she was a main character and had blue hair
Besides, I'm just talking about the OPENING.

You know you can make the japanese commercal song appear
pikmin 2?
Also, as long as either one of the captains have Pikmin, they won't be lost.
:D
lol
A good idea for the zelda wiiU could be have the inventory screen on the controller
Hurry
/me is starting to panic.
I maintain that they should port Skyward Sword to the Wii U and add features, like they did to TP before it. >_>
Oh.
panic, why?
I found this odd scan in Metroid Prime 3
Zombi U looks meh tbh
:O
Majoras mask hasn't been confirmed yet
yes itt has
dat dari-bot
As far as I'm aware anyway
Inb4 they just port Ocarina onto the U
Theres still debated wether it should be remade or A link to the past should be remade
Aaaaaaah! We're out of time!
oh no....
You left one behind
Nooo!
And by that, I mean Ian McKellen.
Never forget.
At least the enemies won't be there tomorrow.
I think there was 5 fatalities
11
11 :/
That'd be....pretty engaging honestly. >_>
Then why did they throw it in Prime 3?
:O FFVII?
No one has that statistic sadly ;_;
You want to know something disturbing?
The morph ball results...are not pretty
Unless I put it down
Why don't you send those Pikmin to the treasure and let Louie bring the other ones?
I know it was made roughly by the same people
afk?
But different universe
AFC. Away From Controller.
AFS. Away from stream
Fungi forrest was origonaly going to be in Banjo Kazooie
Guess where it ended up
....I thought my idea was a good one...
They decided to place it in DK64
Wiimote in one hand as a gun, the tablet strapped to other arm as a wrist communicator thingie
/me sulks
I'm watching football also...
There is a few things that make it unique
They need to fucking bring back the add and remove suit funtions
...
0 Czech - Portugal 0
BRB
In zelda, they should use the wii pad as a shield
I think you can pluck them now.
That seems like it'd be pretty kickass for both Metroid and Zelda. ....goddamnit, why is Wii U releasing without a Metroid or Zelda?!?
yo!
Strap it on like a shield
Oh wait, did some just die out?
And you can still use as a item menu
Or use it as a invetory screeb
*screen
/me is concerned.
i saw enough at e3 and the pre-release information to know i hate it
a) screen is poor
2
b) motion controls are too innacurate
Back :)
waht out?
It'd make the Safarai zone a lot more worth while.
c) cant actually handle 2 screens, though it was initially announced with 4
leaves*
it fakes 2 screens by dropping the framerate
:O
i just got myself a wii
!!!
..........
GO BACK
I have a Wii
ded
.......................................................................
11,02Where'd they go? D:

They all died.
they actually aim for a "lack of left and right" rather than a "go up and down"
You might want to reset.

HIOYA everypony
Both his guitar work and his singing are pretty mediocre.
ohdearwut?
beyond logic? :O
Although maybe his guitar work is mainly the shitty tuning/effects to blame.
Saturn's headset = pinkie pie
Although that's probably still his fault.
We still hear Saturn fine
Gotta go

03cya
08,01what are we talking about?
/me glomps Saturn
Saturn: Australia
08,01not to seem 1-dimensional, but i hope it's sex
LOL
Saturn: of course
LOL
0,14...is this Dire Straits?
nothing wrong with that Saturn
Saturn: Well we WEREN'T talking about sex, but we can if you want.
08,01otakon: hmmm
08,01they would lose some of their inherent cuteness
08,01and charm
inb4 the convo becomes sex
Humans are too familiar. The anthropomorphic aspect is endearing without being uncanny valley.
wassup good people
Saturn: yeah, but the character traits and development would be the same
08,01and also the fact that they're ponies, which is stereotypically a girly thing
real ponies? wha?
08,01so i guess a lot of people wouldn't have the same kind of introspection and epiphany they have now when realising they like the show
Saturn: if humans it would NOT be "inherently" girly.... nothing is inherently ANYTHING by the way.
Two great tastes don't always taste together, of course...
Hm
08,01otakon: i didn't say "inherently"
Real ponies? naaaaaah they have to be magical you see
08,01i said "stereotypically"
08,01i did say "inherent cuteness"
08,01and i do stand by that
08,01ponies are cuter than humans
00,10I would have to go in to my windows.old directory to check the masive log
08,01we tend to talk about interspecies sex a lot in here
That eats jellyfish
Saturn yes, yes they were
I think I was here for the interspecies thing
0,14o_o
2,14 despite my best attempts to STOP that kind of talk in here -_-
Saturn: I have a fetish for sex =p
Oh hey, Val's back.
08,01actually, let's not talk about that
Saturn lmao, well tell us yours first xD
Saturn: meh, I'm rather open about my lack of kinks, actually.
What's up, Val?
Saturn: good idea
My brain hurts 6_9
Saturn aww :(
08,01maybe in pm
http://i.crackedcdn.com/phpimages/article/8/5/1/131851.jpg?v=1

Val is going to trident you.

Darn... looks like I missed all the action on my favorite channel

00,10bate and Saturn in the same sentance
This is why I don't play tf2 much
08,01Wrek: yes. yes, i am.
Clean up the channel. Ha!
0,14...I'm loving this song.
