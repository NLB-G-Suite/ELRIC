alexxm: the blue haired one is special
Irish_Pony: I can't draw :'(
alexxm: Considering Russo-Japanese relations, i'd rather not know.

Acid-Ace: sounds kickass
"We will upgrade these people."
Well, that's about normal fors Russo-Japanese relations...

So its not the same skill
Acid-Ace: They began to use more then one template, stopped using the original Jango Fett copy, and began recruiting other humans in too.
Well thats acceptable for an answer
FairysHuff: You haven't? They always have these annoying high-pitched squeaky voices...
METAL GEARS :D
How appropriate they're guns are in the shape of an AK-47.
those are some huge-ass smgs
Always with the mechs
WindWhistler: I don't have a problem with them.
REVELATIONS
Sumica: you should have an animation dusting something, it would suit your outfit :3
WindWhistler: In fact I like it
Why are animes so much better in the jap dub?
METAL GEEEEAR
who actually makes the giant ass guns the mechs use
Acid-Ace: Because the Japanese are gods at making anime and manga
Acid-Ace: Cause english dubs are very poor
There's no such thing as a bad anime or manga.
alexxm: giabt-ass weapon manufacturers
Because lots of the context and emotion of the anime is lost when a english dib is created.
WindWhistler you sure?
dub*
TOP PONIES NEVER EVER GIVE UP :3 Hello Everypony !!!! ^.^
Whoops I twitched and clenched my fist
so how are you hml?
i can still talk
You know whats a really poor edit in One peice?
Dumori: Or so I thought. But apparently there's plenty of bad anime according to Bennet the Sage.
hello?
Yes, the characters in animes are bound to their voices. They lose a lot of that in english dubs.
robot>armored vehicles
These bullets are the size of artillary shells and very expensive, yet they shoot them like nothing
WindWhistler there is mostly as there a FUCKTONN
I forget her name.... but one of the characters was gone for a long time, supposedly in the jap dub she either died or was in prision..
Cant wacth away from Sumica dancing
I'm okayish
so much manga exists
The fuck 4 kids!
no laptop until monday
x3
Now flying mechs? How impracticle
HEY EVERYPONY! :)
4kids just sucked so hard
Howdy Ponies47.
Ponies47: Holla! :)
hey Ponies47!
I don't get why 4kids keeps dubbing violent anime...
hey Ponies47 hows your day been
Why the shit would you remove the reason a character went missing!
I mean, One Piece, seriously?
WindWhistler: why not
Though they don't own it anymore
This is why you either BUY the anime DVDs or watch online folks. Never watch anime on terrestrial tv
Dumori: agreed
sagas: They keep censoring all the blood and stuff
FACEPLANT
WindWhistler: yup, their one piece dub is terrible
Hi Everlasting_Joy GilDash MahBoi777 alexxm fine thank you :P
WindWhistler: not to mention they took out the death of a main character
HIYA EVERYPONY
WindWhistler: Let the kids enjoy a good show. Blood and stuff isnt always necessary
WindWhistler: not to mention that ghastly opening rap -_-
What a bad shot
Look at dat swager
hey Bronysith hows your day been
of COURSE the giant mech has hair
Though I like Yu-Gi-Oh 5D's opening...it's really good.
Howdy Bronysith.
Hey Bronysith :)
You know its bad when they drop a character for no reason when its been edited out
Dark_Horst: I was just about to say something. :D
Ty Everlasting_Joy Ponies47 and alexxm
Does anyone know the name of that blue haired chick from one peice?
Bronysith: No prob :P
WindWhistler: NO! ANYTHING PAST THE ORIGINAL SERIES/CHARACTERS
WindWhistler: CAN NOT EXIST!
sagas: Then G4 shouldn't exist either.
I forget the girl's name... she was a main character and had blue hair
Besides, I'm just talking about the OPENING.
This is gonna bother me now...
WindWhistler: G4 is not shit. The Yu-Gi-Ohs after the original characters are shit
aww
KUUUUUURZZZA WWWWWWWEBEEEER!
Acid-Ace: Vivian?
But Card Games on motorcycles!
00,10what's recoil?
WindWhistler: They bastardized the series
I think so hoody
Acid-Ace: too gimmicky
sagas: Dude. I'm just talking about the OPENING!!
Sumica: i have no idea what you're talking about :3 :D
Guess what happened to Vivian?
WindWhistler: eh it was alright
Know how she just vanished?
Sumica: Something Newton invented? :S
sagas: You're getting too worked up.
guns.....how do they work?
Acid-Ace: i like one piece but i dont keep up with it
In the jap dub she died
MahBoi777: Well, you pull a trigger....
So yea... 4kids dropped that completly
WindWhistler: Yu Gi Oh was my childhood
Sumica recoil is whenever you shoot a gun, and it sort of pushes itself back, due to it propelling a bullet at a high speed
WindWhistler: does the bullet come out the small end?
Can you see why I hate 4kids?
00,10chain saw sword
A main character dies and they completly remove the character from exsistence
that kid is way to happy about being in a war zome
MahBoi777: theres a little fairy inside each gun chamber that makes bullets fly at over 800ft per second and kill people
And they still stayed near the windows
Sumica: Oh heck yes!
alexxm: He grew up in a war zone
TheHoodyNinja: ohhh, that makes sense, thanks
meh, skype is stupid
MahBoi777: thats how cod explained it
it deleted all my contacts
Was the Yugioh show made first then the cards? I guess its obvious...
andoid app
Their called murder fairies
I have 12
o.o
Acid-Ace: the yugioh manga is actually fantastic . read it sometime
/me pulls out an empty bottle
Acid-Ace the manga came first
Acid-Ace: The original Yu-Gi-Oh manga didn't even involve cards. They didn't appear until the second volume, and then they disappeared for a while.
/me is happy because he got a game on itunes
:D
Biglaw: Yay :)
Though for some reason, the mangas for the other Yu-Gi-Oh shows came AFTER the animes...
Biglaw: congratz!
TheHoodyNinja: Lol
What the hell did the manga even have for a plot?
i just noticed a big chocolate stain on my shirt
if it didnt have cards
and now im in the library till six
damn
5ePonies47 No yaying
TheHoodyNinja: Chocholate, sure.
It's a game called Fastar, it's pretty good. I had it before, but I had to rebuy it

lunac: Okie doki loki
WHO HERE SPOKE OF MIKO SUMICA? XD
Acid-Ace: Well, there's this spirit who takes over Yugi's body and plays Shadow Games with people who do bad things, and then punishes them with some sort of hallucination.
Hey Very_Silly_Filly :)
hey Very_Silly_Filly hows your day been
Biglaw: Really cause I didn't ^_^ LOL
WindWhistler: that sounds too rediculace to be beliveable
/me notices fluer eyeing sumica pony

hey sky
FairysHuff: http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/642/lawlmiko.png :P
Very_Silly_Filly: ow and why?
Acid-Ace: You should read the manga yourself. Or watch season 0, which is based off of it.
how come Very_Silly_Filly
I'm not even sure if I explained it well.
Because I was trolling him
skaii
You mean green hair kiba?

DaringDude: I haven't, but I wondered if they were any good
This is interesting
According to Lauren, she initially wanted Tara Strong to voice Pinkie Pie, and Tara wanted to voice her with a Bubbles-esque voice.
We should watch Hostile at some point
So Tara was supposed to be Pinkie Pie...
00,10doubt that will ever happen TheHoodyNinja

Twilight says do I look like I speak squierl? Funnily enough her VA does
Hey there everypony

Howdy Obsidian.

There was a line where Twilight said do I look like i speak Squierrel?
/me throws up rainbows on flutterchu
She doesnt, her voice actor did as bubbles though
Dark_Horst: I'd rather not, not looking forward to changing my underwear fifteen times in one hour.

TheHoodyNinja what was that for
I forget who the pony was
LETS DO THIS!

Featherweight was originally called Milquetoast and he was Namby-Pamby's little brother.
Acid-Ace: Applejack
Acid-Ace: The editor in chief, noted in S2E23.
TheHoodyNinja: Princess Clara. Also Toot Braunstein in the same show.
Acid-Ace: mistel, never mind, lol
flutterchu: too much spinning
hrm
:P
GO GO GO
What if there was like a bucket full of melted cheese and i ate it?
MahBoi777: AJ does it better :D
wow you beat up a punching bag
In Lauren's original pitch for the show, Pinkie Pie was a Pegasus and Fluttershy was an Earth Pony. The entire cast went through a design change, from G1 Ponies to G3 Ponies (though some of them are In Name Only).
i think i might get lolipop chainsaw looks hilarious
what is this???
Sylandest1: O U:D
lol this is an intense game
CCCP: The constipation levels would be off the scale.
MahBoi777: XD

Everlasting_Joy: lol :D
So wait Tara is the main character in lolipop chainsaw?
*nods to the rythem*
lol
Acid-Ace: and also harley quinn :D
Acid-Ace: Yeah
That explains the artwork of Twilight with a chaincaw and outfit
haha
I wondered what caused that
all perfect?
Several characters had name changes for legal reasons. Twilight Sparkle was Twilight Twinkle (a G3 pony), Princess Luna was Princess Selena, Apple Bloom was Appleseed, Big Macintosh was Big Apple, and Gilda was Grizelda.
oh this
This yay
I have to ask about the name changes
I love this one, especially the "King" one.
oh gawd this
Also Timmy Turner, Poof, Raven, Bubbles, Batgirl in Batman: TAS, and what not.

alexxm: Fine, as always :)
TheHoodyNinja: :D
Apperently Laruen intended Celestia to be a Queen
Except thanks to disney Queens are stereo typed as EVIL
of course
Omg going to see prometheus today
TheHoodyNinja: enjoy! It should be good
Kuzco is best Disney Queen
prometheus looks kinda stupid
TheHoodyNinja have fun

omnipony: that was nearly everyone's reaction
hey otakon hows your day been
Incompetent ruler
space rocks hate short people
lol i like to be random
Howdy otakon!
Obsidian, MahBoi777 doing some job searching atm, just popping in
Acid-Ace: He's smaller than a dime
darn derping stream
alexxm: could be better, still no job
WindWhistler: thats small
Cool
oh okay
who's the main villan
flutterchu: economy problems
flutterchu: There is no main villain.
sorry to hear about that otakon
so, just popping in to say hi and have some background noise really
the villain is u for throwing plants
that makes sense
God I dislike Celestia alot some times
Acid-Ace: IKR
otakon: Good luck it can be rough out there
This game is basically a bug world.
All the enemies are bugs
giant bugs
Obsidian: eeyup
lol that boss
so I'd say you're about the size of an ant
nintendo never ceases to amaze me
Nooooooo"
or confuse me
SuperBrony64: so did you get the game when it first came out?
SuperBrony64: Do you have the first Pikmin?
I love the whole company pretty much fails because Loui ruined the job
Hello.
Pikmin on stream?
Acid-Ace: SPOILER ALERT
The developers basically say the Pikmen are ants
ya
Hello WallDives
dat face
Seems legit
Acid-Ace you just kinda threw a spoiler there
The game has been out for years and I didnt say how he ruined the job
I just said he failed the job
Never said HOW
Just a quick question, who else is getting Borderlands 2?
otakon why don't you try giving your CV to every shop in town
Acid YOu just did...
Acid-Ace: ya
TheHoodyNinja, I probably will, on X360.
Acid-Ace: It doesn't matter how, you just said he was responsible. That is a spoiler
Acid-Ace: the game is rare dude not a lot of ppl know what it is
11,02Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Yesh and WindWhistler: Yesh :3
Acid-Ace: his cargo got eaten by a ravenous giant space rabbit
TheHoodyNinja: I never played the first one, is it good?
SuperBrony64: Respect <3
SuperBrony64: So why aren't you playing the first one?
MahBoi777: 8.7 in my rating
11,02This is the enhanced version with Wii Remote controls
ah
I absolutely HATE how Pikmin 3 is coming out for Wii-U.
11,02WindWhistler: Cause this one is cooler :3
Pikman2 the journey to africa!!
alexxm: CV? I'm not familiar with that term. anyway, been filling out applications for all the places in town and asking around
11,02WindWhistler: No way, I love that it's coming out on it :D
im still singing that sea ponies thing xD
SuperBrony64: That is true...but you should still start with the first game.
WindWhistler: Why? It looks GORGEOUS in HD
if there that small than in super smash brothers. :O
WindWhistler: theres nothing wrong with it coming out just for wii u
SuperBrony64: Me too
Nice landing
CV is a resume stuff like qualification info
WindWhistler: There wasn't much carry over from 1 to 2.
I want Dark Pit to be in Smash 4
otakon a CV is a resume stuff like qualification info
wonder how much the Wii-U will cost..
Considering that Pikmin is a nintendo franchise, iirc, what ELSE would it be on, the 3DS?
mario link and other people are also small then
Well for one, my mom won't let me get any more systems. And it was planned to come out years ago.
MahBoi777: I heard suggestiong around300 I THINK
He is flouting protocol obviously.
Dont quote me on that
Who ever heard of an dangerous uncharted planet?
Hopefully this turns out better than the Duke Nukem game did.
alexxm: oh, well the problem is I have no real training. I've got experience in the customer service industry however
Does anyone else want Dark pit for smash 4?
Acid-Ace: sounds about right tho
When does the next SSB come out?
TheHoodyNinja, hasnt been announced.
TheHoodyNinja: Probably with the release of Wii-U.
otakon stuff like GCSE's and A levels would go on it
WindWhistler, doubtful.
TheHoodyNinja: it probably might be somewhere after the first year of Wii U
TheHoodyNinja: Around the same time as episode 3 :D
WindWhistler !!! Duke Nukem was amazing!.... If it came out 10 years ago like it is now! =o
We would have heard about it.
But Sakurai said as soon as Kid icarus was done they would begin on it
STEEEEEEEEEEVE!
I hope you can still use the gamecube controller
alexxm: the hell is a GCSE? A levels?
otherwise im screwed
Barbetos|AtWork: Are you kidding? People say the game was HORRIBLE.
Also, Pokemon Conquest is mad fun.
OH Chugga
Ded
He forever regrets that meme
TheHoodyNinja, you could use the WiiU pro controller.
MIYAMOTO!!!
this chair in uncomfortable
otakon stuff you get for doing exams at least in england
is*
So whats so special about the pro controller?
Acid-Ace, nothing, except it looks like a X360 controlelr.
Acid-Ace: its pro?
controller^
That sound un impressive
11,02It's lighter than the GamePad Acid-Ace and maintains the look and feel of a traditional gamepad.
The best part of E3 this year: http://www.vgcats.com/comics/images/120605.jpg
WindWhistler Oh it was good, it just sucked really bad for console players as the port was not optimized at all. The other problem was that it pretty much copied a bunch of other FPS games that had already came out. Like I said if it came out like 10 years ago like it is now, then it would of been way better.
WallDives: all controllers look the same man
they announced a game caled super msash bros "Universe" for 3ds and wii u
Acid-Ace: Its meant to show Nintendo can compeat with the other big consoles
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, not really, imo.
3d realms should of just released several games instead of one pile of fail.
I dont see with the game pad issue yet
anyone happy that Luigi's Mansion 2 is coming out for wii u?
Negative much?
Also TEXT WALL
I hope you can plug headphones in the Wii-U thing...
dat text wall
Wait its on the wii U also?
Fuck the 3ds version then
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: I AM NOW THAT YOU TELL ME THIS!
Acid-Ace: they announced it at E3 2012
alexxm: you don't get those here in the US.
Because if someone is watching TV and you want to play a game, how can you even hear what's going on?
I want that new paper mario game
yep
11,02WindWhistler: Yeah, you can :) Check Nintendo's E3 site for more info about the controller
ah right sorry otakon just trying to help
Im only getting Bo2 for the zombies
SuperBrony64: What's the point? My mom isn't gonna let me get it anyways...and I'd been waiting for years for Pikmin 3...*sighs*
And it pisses me off people are allready bitching about Sticker Star's mechanics
hopefully they dont ruin it
Oh lord, this part is HILARIOUS
TheHoodyNinja: i think everyone is
alexxm: that's okay, thanks
Goodbye yalls!
bye Om
bye Om :3
Bye Om
bye Om
bye Om have a nice day
dat face
Later Om.
It isnt even OUT YET, You dont have the right to bitch about something UNLESS YOU HAVE EITHER PLAYED IT OR SEEN IT WELL ENOUGH
Om: See ya. ;)
11,02Later Om!
Bye Om
This next part is hilarious
Sorry...had a bit of a nerd rage there
laters, Om!
did you know that this game has the same moveset as mario in this cancelled mario game for the gamecube called super mario 128
odd how olimers report inculdes game controls
Acid-Ace: i agree!!!! /)
That pikman is not staring at him, oh no, it is ploting his demise!
bye Om!
Om: aww :( byes :D
Acid-Ace this is why i always have a wait and see policy
Louie is drooling.
:D
I only bitch about stuff I played
Louie want to eat him
Louie is hungry.
which is better Pikmin 1 or 2?
2
Unless you play it your self you cant have the right to whine about it
CCCP: Pikmin 2.
CCCP: 2
feed Louie
okay :D
Aw man, the stream skipped the funny part! :'(
I hate what one guy i met on the Hellfire coms stream told me
i need pikmen 1 to get all the trophies in super smash bros melee
I said I liked Other M and he said unless I hate it I'm not a true metroid fan
flutterchu: It's Pikmin, not Pikmen
The fuck...
flutterchu: really?!! nuuu! that means i do too :(
wut6_9
breeding...
still buffering
Just because I like ONE GAME other people hate, that doesnt make me not a true fan
Acid-Ace: Sooooo, you have to be a fan of it by hating it?
Does this count as asexual reproduction?
yeah i know its pikman but pikmen is what my passwrd is for alot of stuff so pikmen for me
MegaMoonShine: He apperently said so
I've always love that in video games. "Repeatedly tapping A, as reported in Olimar's report. . .
accidwhat game is that?
Who would write that?
Acid-Ace: :|
A metroid game people seem to hate
WindWhistler: ehh...kinda.
Acid-Ace this is why i don't really talk to the extremists of any fan base
flutterchu: Uhh...you shouldn't say your password to other people...
Acid-Ace: The gameplay in Other M is alright, its just the story that people are pissed about
Everlasting_Joy: tap tap tap
how do i reply
You know whats funny?
I like Black Ops :P
MahBoi777: :).
The x parasite clone stuff
xD
Well technically our fanbase acts the same way about G3 and G3.5... >_>
what Acid-Ace
WindWhistler: my password is ****
:P
so the ridly in Fusion is a clone of a clone of ridley
and i did not tell you what progams i use that password for
because said corpse of ridley in fusion was from the bottle ship
and it ends with a number
So its a zombie clone of a clone
hey everypony!
WindWhistler to be fair it deserves it
hi Kakumy
hey Kakumy
Hello Kakumy
hey Kakumy hows your day been
And Neo ridley HURTS MY EARS
what's up
Kakumy: awesome!
Alot of people mock Samus's panic attack in other M
who streaming?
Wrek...
I understand why she panics
whats it like Kakumy is it going well?
alexxm: No it doesn't. Those characters made the G4 characters.
Kakumy: sb
G3 is best G
Acid-Ace: IKR
I forgot how much product placement is in this game.
Super metroid supposedly in the time line takes place After prime
WindWhistler i meant in terms of writing
ya it's going well..
and prime 2 and 3
Wtf
ugh i keep buffering...
And Ridley fucking blew up with the planet and she thought that was it so its fair she panics
alexxm: Now that I can understand. The characters are just victims of bad writing...they shouldn't be criticizing the actual characters...
so wait pikmin is set afteer the end on earth
also can I say Ridley IS FUCKING BUFF in Other M?
i hated the way samus reacted to Ridley in Other M
Uh
ok, somepony tell me what the pikmin are saying
WindWhistler i never did critize the characters
Why is there a Duracell o.o
nooo i wont get to see a pikachu!!!!!!!!!:'(
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: To be fair that was supposed to be the final encounter and the planet blew up with him
alexxm: I meant "they" as in the fanbase
Also the fact he murdered her parents doesnt help
CriticKitten: we be on earth, long after we've all gone poof
how do i reply
That's why I personally believe that the G4 characters would NOT react in horror to their G3 counterparts.
anyone
flutterchu: Type the start of the guys name and press tab
Sylandest1: they are saying bring me dinner damnit
ughh I keep buffering too much... is it because I download too fast...
After all the games I have played I have come to relise The Galactic Federation is FUCKING EVIL
WindWhistler: wait what
Sylandest1: I knew there were on Earth, but if it's long after humans, shouldn't the battery be sort of more....decayed?
so wait pikmin is set after the end on earth
Speed Painting Sumica, for practic^^
http://img100.imageshack.us/img100/521/speedpaintsumica.png
TheHoodyNinja: If G3 and G4 met, the G4 ponies would not be horrified.
After all, the G3 ponies are just victims of bad writing.
The Galactic Federation is either secretly evil in parts of it or morns
WindWhistler: oh is that all?
And yes Speed painting is not focusing on details. :P
alexxm: nooo i wont see a pikachu!!!!!!11:'(
Hey SuperBrony64, if you use the D-pad to move the Pikmin, you don't have to throw them at the object if you're close.
Troopers have taken bribes from space pirates...
MahBoi777: :D
TheHoodyNinja: Yeah.
They tried to capture the X parasites and the SA-X
CriticKitten: some things would be, but in this case, its possible we're looking at a different flow of time here, so to speak
They had secret metroid facilities....
11,02Everlasting_Joy: Thanks for the tip ^-^
Acid-Ace: ya but other m is chronologically after Super Metroid so there have been couple of times where she sees him again
flutterchu what
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: the prime games come before super
:O PIKMIN?
Acid-Ace: ya
I love pik men yay
So thats 2 encounters

Wrek: Stuff.

Kakumy: You think this is weird? You should see Cubivore!
11,02I'm playing Pikmin 2 on stream Wrek, you should watch :D
05Everlasting_Joy: jsut came from playing some tf2 x3
ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE Sumica
THAT IS A INSANE IDEA
flutterchu smash bros isn't cannon for any of the nintendo games involved
SuperBrony64: ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE
Ok nvm..
Wrek: Then I'm out of ideas.
How the fuck would you controll them?!
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: madness? THIS IS (insert region of desire here)
If Mb was destroyed the metroids would go on a rampage
Everlasting_Joy: wahts ur steam id?
Bronysith: I don't have one.
05yeah Everlasting_Joy. add me on steam
Everlasting_Joy: okay then
05we'll play some games and eat cheddar cheese

Courage Reactor
Oh yeah, some of the names of these items are hilarious.
Wrek: REmember how I said a couple of days ago, I don't have any PC games?
wow so much product placement

While it's still going.
Theres a record for this crap?
05jsut sayin'
Or maybe you have to hold A?
Wrek: but he needs to buy something to be able to friendo peopple
:O, but will it work on my obsolete computer?
TheHoodyNinja: What do you mean?
All i know about the metroid time line is the prime trillogy comes before super and Metroid 2 comes before Super
alexxm: hip hip hooray
Everlasting_Joy: what computer is it?
All i know is Fusion is last in the time line
05Everlasting_Joy: crank down the settigns and maybe
<3 this music\

WindWhistler: the ship said we will be done in record time
No PS3 or XBOX 360 games :P
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: why not? valve is awesome
I personally like the GameCube controls better.
05Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: ratehr feed valve than EA
Wrek: /)
Wrek: yah but still
Both
Wrek: K. Well, if you have a link, I'll look into it right now.
WATER WRAIIIITH!
I dont like EA
Oh lord Water Wraith.
Who does, nowadays?
Pikmin is best black sheep
BRB
I like to call him Water Wuss though.
have to have a 10 dollar pass to play their shitty multiplayer
closet thing to true pikmin other then smash bros i played was the overlord games
Oh, press +!
Everlasting_Joy: http://store.steampowered.com/app/440

Geez, those fatasses ate them all
If you notice, the PikPik carrots all look towards the enemy.
Still giving carrots... eh..
Kakumy: wich is why i like 2k and gearbox
SO MENNY KAROOT
what do the carrots do
Why are there so many damn carrots!?
I still don't get how they're breadbugs.
mmmmm carrots.....ewwwww
They are all fat bastards now
Super emptied Carrot Top's fridge
dat science
Oh yeaaaaah, they're not real bulborbs
SuperBrony64: These guys don't do anything.
Science : We throw stuff to the wall and see what sticks
TheHoodyNinja: mine is Ubisoft, Naughty Dog and Rockstar Games
CARROT SPAM
Kakumy: those are good ones, i dont know Naughty Dog tho :p
THROW THE CAAAAROOOOOOOOOOOOOTS!
TheHoodyNinja: Crash Bandicoot
King Dedede's them is awesome
WindWhistler: ah
BACK :p
HI Ponies47 WHY ARE WE YELLING
Moar carrots needed
TheHoodyNinja: Naughty Dog created Uncharted 1, 2, 3 and The Last of Us
TheHoodyNinja: Was I yelling? I'm sorry :(
Kakumy: I have never played any of those
Ponies47: EVERYONE YELLING
TheHoodyNinja: Their PS3 exclusives
Im not yelling
I love the Mario & Luigi Saga
I'm not yelling :(
TheHoodyNinja: The Last of Us was at E3
.
brb
Kakumy: I used to have a ps3
OMG IS THAT PIKMIN!
The Last of Us :3
Ah...when in the chat we watch games it's very uncommon for people to talk about ponies.... if Season 3 Episode 1 omg ponies like crazy...
ahh pikmin yay
<3 streamer
Chrysalis: Pikmin 2!!!!
SuperBrony64: If you throw a Pikmin DIRECTLY on top of a Dwarf Bulborb, you'll kill it instantly.
Try the ship.
ill be right back
Are you just spazzing out on purpose?
afk...
SuperBrony64: Waiting for them to grow?
11,02MEGAMAN MEGAMAN, GETTING BIT BY A BULBORB REDUCES HEALTH ON YOUR HEALTH BAR
WindWhistler: Well, you don't get epeleptic seizures randomly do you
roflmao, SuperBrony64
/me hugs WindWhistler
Meh, this game is boring. Now, if it had some ROCK Pikmin...
RAWRity: Now all you need is a Wii U
right here
05SuperBrony64: sequelitis ftw
RAWRity: There are sumo Pikmin.
YAY Egoraptor
Wait, you forgot about the Pikmin in the ground
WindWhistler......he knows what hes doing man..
WindWhistler: who cares about that? Until they make some damn Rock Pikmin, this game will forever be worthless.
WindWhistler: he's waiting for them to grow more
RAWRity: that would make the game broken, I think.
Ohai RAWRity
Now if they WERE to put Rock pikmin in there
then that'd be enormous news
woo tf2 update
11,02Waiting allows the Pikmin to grow into Flower Pikmin :)
and would clearly merrit being the first thing they announce at E3
SuperBrony64: Oooh, that's what you were waiting for.
I'm sure Pikmin 3 has Rocks
Because FUCKING ROCK PIKMIN
RAWRity: WELL THEN GOOD NEWS
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: its nothing major...it was hecka fast for me to update
SuperBrony64: But be careful, if you wait TOO long, they'll go back to being leaves.
08,01boingy
CriticKitten: It still baffles me that THAT was what the led with at the conference.
WindWhistler.........dude.......im PRETTY sure he know how to play and doesnt need you to backseat..
anyone play the overlord games
Shamroc: I'm just trying to be helpful...
That's like if Microsoft had led off their conference by showing off "NBA Baller Beats", the Kinect Rythm game where you learn how to dribble a basketball while listening to LMFAO
be right back agian if anyone cares
Later flutterchu
RAWRity: Not me. Nintendo fans, dude. It's one of their newest most successful franchises.
bye flutterchu
/me 08,01bounces about
08,01Very_Silly_Filly: nope
SuperBrony64: You left one idle
Besides, he'll tell me if he doesn't want my help...
im back
that was quick
RAWRity: It's more akin to them leading with a Mario or Zelda or Metroid, Pikmin is slowly becoming a bigger thing than was expected, I think.
I think there are some eggs around here...
Welcome back flutterchu :P
11,02Obsidian: He chooses not to follow the path of our species, therefore he chooses to die alone o___o
11,02WindWhistler: I want your help silly ^-^
what a tragic life
It's not nearly at those levels yet, but it's starting to be a bigger thing.
SuperBrony64: Foreveralone pikmin
SuperBrony64: :O
SuperBrony64: Heretic Pikmin =/
Ponies47: :|
SuperBrony64: Oh nooo!! :'( You're not actually gonna leave him behind, are you?!
CriticKitten: yes, but their FIRST announcment is "We got pikmin that look like rocks now" the same year they're releasing a new console? Priorities man.
Ugh
gtg
I hate watching them trip as they try to reach the ship in time....only to get eaten by the bugs...
Bye everypony <3
Bye CCCP
Bai CCCP
CCCP: See ya! :)
They talked about the WiiU in 2011
god damnit somebody sitting close to me just sat down to read
By CCCP
im back..
RAWRity: You sure love rocks, don't you?
If you watched E3 11, they talked about the WiiU a bit
SuperBrony64: btw there's a big flower near the red onion
RAWRity: They're launching the new console with only a 2D platformer of Mario, no Zelda, and no Metroid. Pikmin sort of BECOMES a priority when two of your big three are missing.
so would only make sense to open with a smaller franchise
11,02Obsidian: Thanks :D
CriticKitten: That's probably it
Was planning to buy XBOX 360 but when I saw the XBOX 360 at E3 I was damn disgraced...
No Problem
CriticKitten: Especially when many eager fans have been waiting for it for years.
They not release zelda or decent mario, so smaller franchises get a chance
Plus, better than 3DS's launch lot
Considering it was supposed to come out for the Wii, and then they changed their minds...
FOLLOW ME! I'LL LEAD THE WAY!
Check the map to find the lone Pikmin.
As good as the console is, even now, the game selection is one of the worst I've seen ever
They need something weighty to sell the new console with, and they only have Mario. Metroid isn't ready nor is Zelda. So what else? Pikmin, clearly. Notice they advertised it, as well as Wii Fit U (another big seller)?
Also, you might want to get moving...the day's almost over.
They're not entirely stupid. :P
I've heard there was a secret chord that David played, and it pleased the Lord.
But you don't really care for music, do ya?
But as far as a a game I AM interested in: Persona 4 Arena looks like a lot o fun.
music hater!
I felt like when I close my YouTube it made my video slower...
SuperBrony64: Attack it from the rear
Well lets wait a few months
uh oh, I always hate encountering those bulborbs...I'm always afraid they'll eat my Pikmin.
Now I will say, it's sad they're not putting more behind the Wii U lineup. It's got SOME titles....but I think it a mistake to roll without a Metroid or Zelda out of the box.
You see they've mostly been pissing around with the technology
poor mushroom slug :'(
:|
Oh look, another treasure.
CriticKitten: You know you need to get your mind out of the gutter when you accidentally read that "It's got SOME titties..."
We need a second 3DS zelda first :)
/me is getting nervous.
hai everypony
Hai.
CriticKitten: odds are, theyre pushing the system out as soon as they can, so they have some time before they're competing with the PS4 and 720
hai Michael
Pikmin: A game in which your enemies' dead corpses serve as income
Hello Michael
Wasnt there a picture of a zelda game on the WiiU
FOR KIDS
I could have sworn i saw one
Acid-Ace: No, it was a techdemo
Hey Michael :)
/me hugs Kammerjunk Obsidian MegaMoonShine
who's streaming?
Uh oh...day is almost over...
MM hasn't been confirmed either
Daring_Do: SB
/me hugs Ponies47
Hey, everypony-
Acid-Ace: There's a demo mockup of what Zelda might look like on the Wii U, from E3 2011.
Hey, Red_Pegasus|Soviet
By celestia
Salve, Red_Pegasus|Soviet.
hey Red_Pegasus|Soviet and Michael!
Not enough time to get the treasure :(
Oh crap, forgot about that wall.
You should leave one of the captains with the Pikmin so--oh you got it.
Check the map to find the lost Pikmin.
What Pikmin is this?
Red_Pegasus|Soviet: 2
hai MahBoi777
But that was only a demo mockup. There's no announced Zelda title for the Wii U. Honestly I'm surprised they didn't do what they did with Twilight Princess, and just port that to the Wii U with some added features.
Yay! we found him!
Red_Pegasus|Soviet hai
So that zelda picture was a cop out?
CriticKitten: Come to think of it, a Zelda game would have been great to showcase the Wii U controller, since the first thing I thought about for the interface was that it would be great for an RPG
I want to see an FPS for the Wii U.
Acid-Ace: It was a techdemo
You know you can make the japanese commercal song appear
pikmin 2?
Also, as long as either one of the captains have Pikmin, they won't be lost.
:D
i love pikmin
lol
there IS a zelda wiiu game
A good idea for the zelda wiiU could be have the inventory screen on the controller
Acid-Ace: No, not a copout. A demo. E3 2011 was mostly trying to showcase what the Wii U was capable of. So it had a lot of tech demos. This year's E3 showcased some actual games.
SuperBrony64: You don't have time to get the treasure now.
Hurry
/me is starting to panic.
Kammerjunk i think zombieu is a FPS
/me slaps WindWhistler
I maintain that they should port Skyward Sword to the Wii U and add features, like they did to TP before it. >_>
Oh.
panic, why?
I found this odd scan in Metroid Prime 3
Zombi U looks meh tbh
there is a zelda wii u game
:O
It said Project Dread is now comencing...what the hell is Dread?
Majoras mask hasn't been confirmed yet
yes itt has
dat dari-bot
As far as I'm aware anyway
Inb4 they just port Ocarina onto the U
Wait, what about the one at the can?
Theres still debated wether it should be remade or A link to the past should be remade
Aaaaaaah! We're out of time!
Have the player use a Wiimote Plus for the sword, or use the tablet to do quick inventory swap.
Am I the only one thinks Leonard Cohen looks kind of like Magneto?
oh no....
You left one behind
now my my video buffers alot..
CriticKitten: make a wrist-strap peripheral for the tablet, and have them use it as their shield.
Nooo!
And by that, I mean Ian McKellen.
Never forget.
Poor little guy...
RAWRity: I'd go for that.
At least the enemies won't be there tomorrow.
That'd be sweet, actually.
mips is sucking today =/
I think there was 5 fatalities
11
11 :/
What the hell is Project Dread anyway?
Strap to the front of your wrist, motion controls of the tablet dictate shield movement and the screen can act as a quick inventory swap.
Acid-Ace: it was suppost to be a rumored game but it wasnt
That'd be....pretty engaging honestly. >_>
Also, when they showed the Batman Arkham City thing with the remote control batterang, I was just wondering how long it'll take for some kid to hurl the tablet into their TV trying to throw it.
Then why did they throw it in Prime 3?
uh-oh FFVII on steam .... Want..
RAWRity: Straps
:O FFVII?
Acid-Ace: it was probably just some loer stuff
RAWRity: I've always been curious how many Wiimotes have been thrown into televisions
Acid-Ace: lore*
Final Fantasy 7
No one has that statistic sadly ;_;
You want to know something disturbing?
oh hai dead chat
CriticKitten: alot....
CriticKitten: a lot, considering they started releasing heavy-duty wrist straps for them.
The space pirates tried to copy Samus' suit tech
CriticKitten: I remember seeing a video of that happening
Acid-Ace: i think he typoed it by project dream is what he's trying to say project dream is the beta version of banjokazooie are you familliar with that game
The morph ball results...are not pretty
and how you Wii tells you for EVERY GAME to strap the thing on.
CriticKitten: You have to be pretty careless, I've been pretty sweaty sometimes without a strap and it#s never left my hand
SuperBrony64: You shouldn't send so many Pikmin to get the pellets. You need to get that treasure.
Acid-Ace: IKR
Unless I put it down
Science team has vapor for brains
Banjokazooie is the only decent mario clone
Why don't you send those Pikmin to the treasure and let Louie bring the other ones?
I know it was made roughly by the same people
afk?
02*WB03(Ray03)02WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
But different universe
SB be trollin
Way to not pause the game SB
Very_Silly_Filly: BK was made by Rare
AFC. Away From Controller.
AFS. Away from stream
Fungi forrest was origonaly going to be in Banjo Kazooie
Guess where it ended up
Very_Silly_Filly: same people who made the Donkey Kong Countey games
RAWRity: But yeah. I like the wrist strap idea. Could also be cool for Metroid.
Very_Silly_Filly: to my brains banjo kazooie is not a mario clone
....I thought my idea was a good one...
They decided to place it in DK64
Wiimote in one hand as a gun, the tablet strapped to other arm as a wrist communicator thingie
/me sulks
I'm watching football also...
CriticKitten: dont forget inventory
There is a few things that make it unique
They need to fucking bring back the add and remove suit funtions
...
Dude, I'd love the idea of playing a pokemon game on the Wii U.
0 Czech - Portugal 0
BRB
In zelda, they should use the wii pad as a shield
I think you can pluck them now.
I miss the add and remove suit functions from super metroid
That seems like it'd be pretty kickass for both Metroid and Zelda. ....goddamnit, why is Wii U releasing without a Metroid or Zelda?!?
yo!
Strap it on like a shield
Even the pikmen are annoyed by SB
Oh wait, did some just die out?
And you can still use as a item menu
Hello LightningDashFast
Or use it as a invetory screeb
*screen
CriticKitten cause the WiiU is an abomination that nintendo deserve to suffer heavily for
hai LightningDashFast
When it comes time to catch a pokemon, you use the tablet to choose a pokeball, and then use the wiimote to throw it.
Chrysalis: IT ISNT EVEN OUT YET
Chrysalis: O_O
because that's the first game my brother and i have ever played
Added feature: you have to aim it at the pokemon to catch it.
/me is concerned.
No one has the right to bitch about ANYTHING untill you try it your self!
RAWRity: That would be annoying.
i saw enough at e3 and the pre-release information to know i hate it
My first game was Super Mario World on the SNES
so is this pikmin or pikmin 2?
a) screen is poor
2
WindWhistler: why?
b) motion controls are too innacurate
Back :)
oh i c
waht out?
It'd make the Safarai zone a lot more worth while.
I love how people bitch about stuff that ISNT EVEN OUT YET
c) cant actually handle 2 screens, though it was initially announced with 4
MahBoi777: Because he isn't pausing and the Pikmin are going to go back to being leavse.
Chrysalis: According to them, they have improved Wiiplus LOADS
leaves*
it fakes 2 screens by dropping the framerate
Wait, what about the treasure?
:O
i just got myself a wii
!!!
..........
GO BACK
WindWhistler: oh
SuperBrony64
I have a Wii
ded
SB you Troll
.......................................................................
Bought a black one for 60 quid with Motion pluss
11,02Where'd they go? D:
Microsoft added mroe shit to their console...
Very_Silly_Filly not really, they still have a MASSIVE issue in that they can't actually detect up and down properly
all the pikmins
SuperBrony64: they drowned! you drowned them!
SB: Red Pikmin can't swim.
ded
They all died.
they actually aim for a "lack of left and right" rather than a "go up and down"
SuperBrony64: Pikimen 101 Reds dont swim
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5xqyoTb651r3xauuo1_1280.png dat molestia
You might want to reset.
which is why every game you can just couch and waggle it
Wait... who streaming im still confused...
SB, are you murdering your Pikmin?
SuperBrony64: You should've had them get the treasure.
u murderer
no wait you MoNsTeR
the WII
need MOAR pikmins
ohai
Reset?
Throw them across
Bronysith: lol
needz moar portal
needz moar ponies!
rofl
jk jk
:D
Throw your wii mote into the screen! AND THEN ASK FOR COMPENSATION FROM NINTENDO!
Fun game.
YES
/me sits on SuperBrony64
has anypony played chrono trigger?
11,02These Pikmin are stronger
whats going on
Chrysalis: lolwut, it was originally announced with ONE screen, not four.
Think I'm finally getting the hang of playing X-COM. Though I am playing on easy ^_^
/me farted
:P
CriticKitten not to devs
LightningDashFast I has! I gots it for my DS.
LightningDashFast: of course
12!pokemon
Soital, you are a 5Abomasnow.
One of the major complaints of last year's E3 was that it would only feature 1 screen.
it was supposed to be 4 screens
HAHAHAHAHAHA
MURDER!!
and ded again
Damnit SB
LightningDashFast: i played it on the SNES and i am going as crono for dragoncon
lol
Game over
thats what all the initial leaks were about
wtf just happen again??
FFFFFUUUUU
:(
YOU MONSTER:O
Sumica:
genocide.
:)
SuperBrony64:
Initial leaks are garbage.
why
The god of death
horray we killed them
Fail
Hello everypony! Long time no see!! Speak*
how dare you!!!! :[
EVILLLLLL
I hate people bitch about stuff they never played
hiy TheMonstaMuffin
hai TheMonstaMuffin
hey TheMonstaMuffin hows your day been
Game over?
Because they're usually inaccurate. >_>
Hey TheMonstaMuffin :)
hi TheMonstaMuffin
hey TheMonstaMuffin!
howdy, TheMonstaMuffin
I think so Obsidian
Sonic 06 the main exception
Sonic 06 can be bitched about regardless
Hiya, best community ever! :3
My Skyward sword expereience was pretty good
SuperBrony64: When you Pikmin are drowning, you call them from dry ground, they'll head in that direction and get back to land.
bored now, later guys
E3 exists so we can get correct information, most of the "leaks" during the regular year tend to be wrong
Blonic
ALL GREEN EYED SONIC GAMES SUCK
Never really had a problem with pointing up and down
bye TheHoodyNinja!
You probably shouldn't save...
later TheHoodyNinja! take care
how about legend of the dragoons?
Oh fuck the sonic fanboys
bye TheHoodyNinja
for ps
/me glomps LightningDashFast "OF COURSE"
bye TheHoodyNinja
Sonic has the most broken fanbase EVER
Acid-Ace: i know right
Wait, you could've started from last save...
And aleexm. Its been fine. U?
i dont like the nintendo characters...
! free pikman
and then start again, better load game
...I should probably just let you do your thing...
Besides, the Wii U is fine. And I can't speak for your experience with Wiimote Plus, but I've never had any issues using it.
it took me a while to beat it
Should I feel bad for ratting out my sister?
Pikman is rarity
/me sulks
THROW IT IN THE LAKE!
Acid-Ace: NOT AT ALL
Lets see ho long before he kills it
Kakumy: NO ONE DARES MAKE FUN OF MY FLUTTERCHU
She was looking up female porn
nooooooooo
So yea.... and she's 12
don't kill it!
Acid-Ace: Is she lesbo?
O_O flutterchu?
...............................................................
I know i've been inactive latley.. :/
kill it!
YOU MONSTER
11,02This game is too hard :/
lol
But no worries! I will be on more from now on!!
murderer:[
40 seconds a new record!
:(
.............
Is superbrony sadistic?
It's been plenty accurate enough to play Skyward Sword and actually feel like I'm wielding a sword. If you wanna be the dork on the couch waggling the remote instead of the cool kitten (like me) who swings that thing like it's real and beams friends in the face with it, then you can do that.
flutterchu: except for Pokemon I like Pokemon
SuperBrony64: u need a shotgun
SuperBrony64: You can't put red Pikmin in water.
Kakumy: dont touch me:[
Acid-Ace: he likes outright failing games at times for no paricular reason
You need to get blue Pikmin...
11,02WindWhistler: D: Why didn't you say so sooner??
SuperBrony64: I said so multiple times.
lol
SB is best troll
/me throws pokeball at flutterchu
WindWhistler: SB is trollin you
RAGEQUIT!!!
SB is evil tyrant
SuperBrony64: how about some King of the Hill man?
Hi SuperBrony64. I see its 'Pikmin' thats on the menu :3
11,02TheMonstaMuffin: Indeed :3
SuperBrony64: Maybe I should PM you instead, so that way my comments won't be pushed up by everyone else.
TheMonstaMuffin: That game is too hard for him
So should i feel ANY guilt that I ratted out my sister?
Kakumy: flutterchu blengs to me
howz about some chrono trigger?
http://sharkrobot.com/images/large/shirt_vgcats_pikaflash_LRG.jpg
SuperBrony64: :3. Maybe you noticed im back from a long break. Obsidian: Lolz, nah Sb64 is pro xD
Oh were gonna watch E3..

E3 was meh

It's okay. I'll just hope there's still some more I don't know about.

Acid-Ace: Good Snitch
Biglaw: My solution to that is plugging in the headset, and then just not put it on your head. :)
And yet she lies so much they dont belive me when i have nothing to do with when things happen
Biglaw: thats the most annoyign part about COD...
CountDoofus I do not have xbox live, so I do not have to worry
She's also carved holes in the walls
Biglaw: CoD is horrible
and painted her furniture
Kakumy: the most annoying part of CoD is that it is the same game every year
shes not pinkamena is she?
lol
Bronysith: I'm just getting Black Ops 2 to make pony emblems :P
I do not have CoD, the only experience I have playing it is at a friends place
Kakumy :D
Very_Silly_Filly: Just checked the Walking Dead game. No episode 2 on my end.
Bronysith: 3 year old would say what the *f-word* yeah he would just cus alot
Kakumy: why would you waste 60 dollars on that
later everypony, i'll go dinner
It worries me when my sister cant drive properly in Mario kart
Toodles Michael
I'm 14... I don't but it myself..
Bye Michael

Bye Michael
Kakumy: its just so horrible game
She says the wheel is difficult or something
Michael: seeya!
Bronysith: I prefer making pony emblems....
Also I hate playing video games with my sister
bye Michael!
KOTOR is one of the best games ive played
Kakumy: but you are supporting a horrible franchise
Why no stream?
LightningDashFast: /)
Best game I ever played was GTA 4
I'm 28 and enjoy playing CoD. I don't care what anyone thinks. *umad face*
LightningDashFast: i am a sith brony
bye Michael
LightningDashFast: there for Bronysith

LightningDashFast: banjo kazooe best game ive ever played
I played Dantes Inferno, and I kind of want to read the book "The Divine Comedy"
RustyMeat: Waiting on Wrek
Bronysith: I'm not even supporting it.....
The best game i've played was WoW, before it died
be right back
Kakumy: you are supporting CoD by buying it
It isnt dead Dark
nope it is
Bronysith: Still don't really care...
Acid-Ace: life support
^
The best game I played that wasn't a shooter was iNinja
im back
Kakumy: it is the same game every single year. why waste 60 dollars every year?
ive tried to find it so i can play on my xbox360
Is nobody gonna say best game ever was Dungeon Keeper?
:P
LightningDashFast: my favorite game is FF6 FF7 and chrono trigger all tied for first
As of may 9 this year its still 10.2 million
Bronysith: MW 2 and MW 3 yes... Black Ops and Black Ops 2 has some differences
Kakumy: yea. slightly shaded guns
:|
yeah those are excellent games
I wonder what game is Game of the Year this year...
unfortunatly, I have work that needs to be done. Later everypony!
Fucking love King Dedede's theme
Half-Life 2 Episode 3. Hands down.
Kakumy here is the lineup for the next few years of call of duty
Kakumy: too early to tell
Acid-Ace: who doesn't?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6Sy1xXDxI Have some
:P:P:P:P:P:P:P:P:P:P
If there is a Modern Warfare 4... I'm never getting it...
Kakumy: BO2 MW4 BO3 MW5 BO4 MW6 etc
Acid-Ace: it used to be 12 million +
Kakumy: that is just a prediction
10 mill is still pretty good
Bronysith: I'm never gonna buy MW4.... I'm just gonna buy BO
I asked the Doctor when Half life 3 was coming out
He said he didn't know
I'm off to school. Later everyone :)
Bye XAX
Acid-Ace: yes, but more ppl are starting to leave
XAX: you still have school?
dont you guys miss the good ol days when the games were nintendo hard and when you beat them you felt like you accomplished something
Mists will bring in more people
bye XAX
:'(
LightningDashFast: There are still Nintendo hard games by Nintendo
LightningDashFast: yep
I'm optimistic
New super mario bros Wii is an example
Acid-Ace: Cataclysm is soooo boring
No it isnt
I pissed the original and the DS one, but wii one I can't do
I found it fun
yeah but they are not as prevelent as they were anymore
Lost levels was retarded though :D
I still remember grinding from level 20 to 80 in less than a month
So...who gonna stream next..
1-60 is very fun content
Wrek but we're waiting
Acid-Ace: Damn, that's fast
http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/6653bb2ec5bc708fe3c356429b1d02ea/132450%20-%20Artist%3AZajice%20fluttershy%20Pikachu%20pokemon%20sketch.png
LightningDashFast: the only game company i really support anymore is awesomeness that is VALVE
I enjoyed it miles more than 60-80
I enjoyed 80-85 somewhat
MegaMoonShine: I had nothing to do during summer so i was bored
Everything was fun to me about cata
Burning Crusade is best Expansion
I've done 85-87 and I really enjoyed it, so I'm looking good for it
Deathwings death was a bit anti climatic though...
^
Also the Pandarens look fun
Is there a stream?
flutterchu: that picture is damn frikin cute..
no
WOW IS DOWNHILL
^
People actually thought they would be the new race for BC
super mario bros 3 was my very first nintendo game
I see we have some haters....
Haters gonna hate... Ponies gonna pwn
this day aria is worst pony song
ive been a gamer ever since
I will how ever fucking slap every person who names their pandaren after something Kung Fu panda related
hiya
is any one else buffering?
Bronysith: shut up
oh and lyra is best gamer pony
Bronysith: how the hell is This Day Aria the worst pony song...
Kakumy: my opinion
hello every one
Acid-Ace: im going to name mine Ackblack
Acid-Ace: I'm naming mine "Pandamando" after Maldonado the panda minded race driver
cow: mooooo
HATEZ!?! WHERE!?!? :[
Bronysith: Oh ok...
:D
What are you guys talking?
yes Moo
Kakumy: so am i not allowed to have my own opinion?
about*
Why do people not relize the pandarens were out before kung fu panda
we gotz a flamewar going on
Gtg everypony! I'll be back soon!
WHATCHU TALK ABOUT PEEPZ?
Oh, you're talking about WoW?
theres no flamewar
Kakumy: i also hate skyrim.
Later Biglaw :)
Acid-Ace: Cause they're stupid?
Kakumy: take that
im not into MMORPGs so i dont play them
Bye Biglaw|Dinner L)
:)
Acid-Ace: because they didnt play WC3
Guys? Someone answer me?
WindWhistler: hi
WC3 showed pandarens, no?
Bronysith: i dont really want skyrim anymore
I'm asking what you guys are talking about.
Warcraft 3 came out in July 3, 2002, Kung fu panda came out in 2008
thats 6 years
ikr
WindWhistler: WoW
Acid-Ace: pandarens are lore
flutterchu: replying test
Besides, it's not like Dreamworks and Pixar are all that original anyway
I thought so. Just wish someone would've answered me sooner...
You're "They're copying kungfupanda" argument is invalad
Bronysith: Son of a ....
Bronysith: Have u even played Skyrim before..
Kakumy: what? am i supposed to like what everyone else likes or something?
WindWhistler: yeh
Kakumy: yes
i remember when MoP trailer came to youtube... lol it was a flamewar
Kakumy: i hate it
"I'm a master at skyrim"
Also I think most of them bitch just to bitch
By the way, here's a more in-depth video about Pikmin 3: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIB5fflsQzM&feature=related
Wait, what's ablivion? Does it have killstreaks?
Very_Silly_Filly: thats like saying your fastest of the slow
- Annoying gamer kids
u mean Oblivion
Sorry, rapey English, starting to get derpy with my spelling
oblivion was excellent however
6_9
the graphics were less
so
WHO GIVES A SHIT
^
who wants to see a Halo version of Toy Story?
GRAPHICS DONT MAKE THE GAME
Graphics doesn't make a good game. Gameplay does.
ok the game play
CountDoofus: /)
Bronysith: Thank you!
Bronysith: yes someone understands
The gameplay was very weird..
Someone who has sense
i needz pony game
WHOEVER PLAYS FOR GRAPHICS is not a true gamer
Bronysith: (\
Do we have examples of good looking games that are shit?
YOU KNOW WHAT GAME THAT HAS THE BEST GAMEPLAY
05but
BATTLEFIELD 3
It could happen
Bronysith: *Cough CoD Battlefield*cough* Sorry, what?
Kakumy: BF3 was good
05appreciatign the graphics =/= demanding them
Acid-Ace: COD MW3
as long as they dont focus on the graphics
I am a packrat in WoW
be like
I focus on both...
"im not playing that game cause it has terrible graphics"
I focus gameplay, then worry about graphics
I have Hakkar's heart C'Thun's eye and Ozmond's head
thats what i meant
what would Pinkie Pie play?
all in my bank
I AM A HOARDER
LightningDashFast: silent hill 2
LightningDashFast: Pinkie would play Purble place cake maker :D
I'm gonna play a Rainbow DAsh game....
*shudder* silent hill 2 eh
have fun Kakumy
rofl :P
You cant even get Hakkar's heart anymore
LightningDashFast: or amnesia the dark descent
:D
08,01i'm gonna start streaming jammy stuff in quarter of an hour
That's like saying Avatar was a good movie just for its 3D and CGI effects. (not saying it was a bad movie, for the record)
so there is no stream?
/me drags Bronysith towards him " I Am a spitter!
you trying to invoke cupcakes man
Whats the webiste for Hub ?
08,01Bronysith: i'm with Sketchy Sounds, and I HAVE MY CELLO WITH ME
Wrek are you going to stream?
I have to admit
Everypony says avatar 3D gave them a heady
headache
Kakumy: Hubworld.com
But I felt nothing :/
I never did a raid till I reached level 80
WindWhisler im nt wasting 6 minutes of pikmen 3 id rather chat with you guys
1...2...pinkamena's coming for u
Kakumy: http://www.hubworld.com/
i dont like skyrim nor this day aria
Can I ask a question?
so do you guys think zombi u will be good
I never really did much raiding myself
Oh ya I'm gonna have fun playing Rainbow Dash...
Acid-Ace: no
sure Acid-Ace
Acid-Ace: techinically you just did
Have any of you delt with someone who has a issue with you and keeps bothering you?
I used to be in a WoW guild
do any of you have a video on cause mine is not
I
i dont play WoW
Sorry, that doesn't mean I actually hate you
I'm never getting Diablo 3...
I earned soooo many achievements though :D
Some people didnt take kindly to me and when I left one guy still had issues with me and he kept bugging me
Very_Silly_Filly: you guys got led zeppelin
Acid-Ace: why didnt you ignore him?
True, but you have some kickass cartoons
Silly Fillies
And this was like almost a year after i left said guild
Acid-Ace: i had a worse raiding guild than yours
Kakumy: Torchlight 2 ftw
Cairne is a weird realm sometimes...
Kakumy: ff7 had horrible graphics but excellent gameplay and story
do any of you have somthing on the screen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
MLP is canadian....>.>
Skyrim is canadian
flutterchu: ya we're watching Sumica's stuff
so do you guys think zombi u will be good
alexxm: No
EF
Then i joined another guild and some people left and they blamed me
alexxm: as long there are no annoying parts
well gtg I never get to play my rainbow dash game :(
how come Very_Silly_Filly
I'm not getting any games like that
Very_Silly_Filly: skyrim is the worst game to come out in 2011 along with BF3 and COD3
bye Kakumy
I felt horrible, the guild master how ever was nice and we still talk
who wants a PONY Video Game?
Skinram wasn't too bad, but it did have it's retarded concepts
i know i do
BRB
Dual wield spells was nice :)
LightningDashFast: We all do :D
Then I ended up staying in a guild called ElfishBastards
Bronysith: I wouldn't say the worst game, but definitely not deserving of GOTY. At all.
CountDoofus: minecraft deserves it
you saw the 8-bit promo right?:O
Anyway, AFK for I must get a shower and get my mane wet
Best game evar
Bronysith: I disagree, 1.8 ruined the game
Oh Very_Silly_Filly, you silly filly.
Wait...
Very_Silly_Filly: better than skyrim
hows about Dead Space with PONIES
True to an extent, but I prefer terraria over minecraft
/me slaps LightningDashFast
LightningDashFast: do not combine EA with ponies
owwwie
Heh
I remember when EA made some actual decent games
Megaman X3 has a great sound track
There's already a fanfic out there that combines Dead Space with MLP. Haven't read it, but it's out there.
Their last decent game that I played was NFS Wanted for the X360
Well the Cd version anyway
well how about resident evi with ponies?
evil*
The SNES version was too rock heavy
Snes Megaman was good
4 different kinds of cheeses and 6 different kinds of meats
or silent hill?
megaman x4 ftw
Flint loves cheese! +80 hp
uhm.. anypony up for minecraft? I'm kind of lonley in singleplayer.

ThunderCloud: do you have a server we could play on?
Hate that game
MM9 ftw
CountDoofus good luck
Bronysith: well, uhm no..
x6 was a pile of dog, but x4 was revolutionary
Now afk
Acid-Ace: i can respect that. i hate skyrim. can you respect taht?
Back :P
Dragon quest 8 was great too
I suppose it is kind of bad...
hey Ponies47 what have you been up to
LightningDashFast: i love akira toriyama characters design
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXrymV-Lgtw&feature=BFa&list=PL0F49B3DB40DC9397 Megaman Starforce music FTW

Either that's a horribly out of tune guitar, or Sketchy is playing some rather horrible seventh chords.
sagas: im pretty sure thats scoots
its 330pm
03I don't wanna use spoilers but aftier the end credits of the last episode basically
Deceptive_Cadence I think it's out of tune.
after-afterlife = irl ?
lemur: i remember that name... hmmm uhh mabey im not actually sure i think he does sometimes
04AUGH SPOILERS

CCCP: He's a good man, I hope to see him soon.

03that doesn't make sense
DashWithRainbows: Not only that, but he's got this really nasty effect on his guitar.

there was a AB S2 announced, but duno what happent to it

GILRS CAN'T LOVE GIRLS
13eww this chocolate melted inside the packet :<
...but...!
etcetc
twilight_sprinkle: Sketchy.
HIOYA everypony
ScootaChicken: We would never do such a thing and we agree with you
Both his guitar work and his singing are pretty mediocre.
ohdearwut?
beyond logic? :O
ScootaChicken: O_o
Although maybe his guitar work is mainly the shitty tuning/effects to blame.
I returneth everypony. Got my arse kicked at X-Com ^_^ What happening here?
Although that's probably still his fault.
ScootaChicken: well i think hes decent for a random fan, they apparently didnt practice much before this,i actually expected him to be worse
Gotta go
bye Marcy!
/me hugs Marcy
And its back
twilight_sprinkle: Should've been there that time that dari blackmailed me into singing WWU on the stream : P
MAybe a frayed wire?
ScootaChicken: he needs to work on the note transition imo, other than thats hes ok i think
And also twilight_sprinkle, AFAIK he's hardly a 'random fan', he's a member of Everfree Radio
sagas: "Insert Random Quote"

sagas: =/
Now that is creepy

Bye bye everypony!!!
twilight_sprinkle: Meh, his guitar on the other hand definitely has something wrong with it.

So, how long have we been watching this? I got my computer back about an hour and a half ago and we've been on this ever since.
twilight_sprinkle: I doubt any guitar can sound that shite without throwing it down the stairs or something. And even then, my guitar still sounded fine after that, so meh...
ScootaChicken: thats why i mentioned this being an unprofessional radio, they dont fully prepare so hard to say for sure
Kandarihu: a while
well its very much worth watching

ScootaChicken: *crying*
ScootaChicken eh, idk anyth about Rush so idk
good ridence
apple bloom
See ya Scetchy
twilight_sprinkle Maybe. But I've lost that respect since 1. He's trying to speak in old english and 2. He clearly doesn't understand playing the guitar as much as Neil, neither do I but, I will admit that it has became quite the annoyance to me very quickly.
<.<

God damn Equalist bigots.
CriticKitten: All made by me

:O
IceInvi: nope

flutterchu: I do have my soft side :$
IceInvi: no]
cant w8 for the 1hr season finale!
You will probably remember this as the most important day of your life....
I'm happy to help these Equalists! :P
Oh hey old man unfortunate backstory.
But for me, it was Amonday.
equalists, non-benders who feel they are oppressed
This reminds me of that game where nazis attack in air ships
omg it's osama!
sagas: when you give people the sad side:'(
the 3rd
aka, kealous assholes
RyunosukeKnT: so they have a good cause really
I wonder who Amon is.
*jealus
Dat car
what?! they have cars?
Meanwhile: It's Pinkie Pie
fuck my brain
....
it's been a long time
Meanwhile: it is you! and your moustache
lol
dat mask guy looks like an epic plot twist
perhaps
rofl
Bronysith: NO ONE MUST KNOW
and they're "Satomobiles"
Firelight: early industrial era
/me wants firebending
this is steampunk ;)
scratch that
cars weren;t that nice though..
I sense some jelly in there...
flutterchu: awwwe no youre making me feel bad :)
0,14...she jelly
I WANT THE FORCE
Amon is obviously Pinkie Pie. Like c'mon she's evil. He's evil. It adds up!
/me gives SaxyPretender an english muffin for the jelly
0,14and trust me, jealous women are a nightmare to deal with
meh women
Ryunosuke: not really, steampunk would require them not having combustion engines
also I dont think- nvm
Saxy: Wouldn't you be? <_<
Car! Welp we're good
SaxyPretender: ^
SaxyPretender: Oh? Personal experience?
Sweet mother of god..
2&2&2&2&2=2
SaxyPretender: Indeed
is this the one hour finale?
it'S somewhat steampunky but not really...
it's confusing in the terminology
sagas: how do i know that youre just typing on not on facetime:'(
Is there a more recent episode than this one currently?
MURICA
General of The United States
Meanwhile: No
This show better not climax too soon and end
Dark_Horst: what exactly makes something steampunk?
CriticKitten: didn't think so.
this is the most recent one
The one hour finale is on Saturday.
Call the Navy!
lol
SHOO BEE DOO
flutterchu: facetime? What?
Bronysith: steampunk requires the scenario of combustion engines never happened and modernt ech driven by steam
See the seven seas!
Call upon the sea ponies
Just use your air bending to force it out
*tech
ahhh Avatar Reference
Quick! They need to find the elements of harmony before it's to late!
Dark_Horst: wtf

Mecha In my Avatar? Looks good.

Of course it has mechs. Just like how Bronystate likes it
Bronysith: dont mind my typing, tired and notebook keybord dont like each other
Air is so Op
flutterchu: dont tempt me....
Yeah... air can crush 6 tons of raw steel... -.-
08,01Reikim: ha, yes!

HIDENBURG
sagas: what deos that mean:'(

Yay
Wait, what?
Reikim: which is better. Lagann hen or hen gurren ?
Hydro Pump
sagas: he reflected lightning
Bronysith: Lagann-hen
sagas: *sigh*
Overlook the fact that the pilot was just roasted.
are they robots or do they have a pilot?
IceInvi: pilots.
IceInvi: they have pilots
oh ya i had this one dream that i was the avatar in this timezone XD....now i think about it i can make some graphic novels about these in depth dreams
flutterchu: -_- I will not be tempted!
the helmets imply pilots
this is quite.... "shocking
XD
Tenzin just jumps right back in the action.
Meanwhile: No sympathy for equalist scum

CriticKitten: No mercy.
Racist dad is racist

Meanwhile: yep
Meanwhile: It doesn't matter because Toph is a badass.
Sumica: That explains the badass.
CriticKitten: Indeed.

Sumica that woman who just has been shocked?
Why does the avatar not have to learn metal bending? Is it a branch of earth bending?

Or vampires.

Ponies47: i did something that u would be proud of me for
Lin is too much badass for one world to handle.
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: And what would dat be? :#

Metal bending = Earth bending?
Meanwhile: incoming death

Still a better ending than HALO 2
but logically that cant be zuko
sagas: Fire nation's good now. Go on Netflix and watch all 3 season of the first one
the suspense is stabbing me in the heart
Bronysith: ^
zuko cant be around.... he was older than aang, and aang's dead
so is there another episode yet?
cause zuko was like 20 or something in first avatar
Now Imma off to bed after these intermission poniez :D

RAWRity: Oh cool thanks, ill look that up
Wrek: its working
My manga isnt working on mangareader and hasnt been for months now
I stopped reading manga a while ago. The last manga I actually read through was Chrono Crusade.
and personally, I think Mangahere's way of doing things is better.
How do I get to the server?

They'll post the new chapter as soon as a scanlator has it done, then replace it with a better one when it becomes available.

RaveGraduate: no problem. I'm glad I found it too.
APS|Evil: refresh mate, they switched services

RAWRity: what's that man?
Oh, they switch services? awesome.
otakon: kkkkk
damn you APS! y u tab fail!
Jarate!
yeah, LimeV is a bit more stable
APS|Evil: IDK :p
/me pours soda on Ponies47
otakon: Magico's a really crappy manga that started in Shonen Jump last year. I've been rooting for it to fail for a while, and it's spent the last 10 weeks at the bottom of popularity polls, so it seems to be ending next week.
So! Awesome!
*Is covered with soda* (gasp) MY MANE! :o
just saw a pinkie [ie poster, did gabe program that himself?
pie*
i love this video
Iron sights?
the shere awesomeness
superretroworld: So you have 2 brothers each guarding a door. One will always tell the truth and one will always tell a lie. You have to go through the door guarded by the one telling the truth. You only get one question and it must be yes or no. What do you ask?
Ooh, TF2
sagas: I've got a letter for god.
Quick, shoot things.
Randomnerd: Okay?
Why didn't you grab out your SMG?
sagas: It's a Ricky Gervais Show thing.
Randomnerd: Never heard that one before
sagas: idk
05i dont use the SMG
superretroworld: Well if you pick the wrong door, you die
sagas: That one's easy. :p
CriticKitten: I know
Ah
FRIGG THE FRIGGIN FRIGGITY FRIGG! its like the whole world is conspiring against me and my brothers to play LEAGUE OF LEGENDS together. why are you down LoL
CriticKitten: There are a few ways to solve it
Bronysith: lol
sagas: and you said you can only go through the door with the guard telling the truth
sagas: It's funny, it's Stephen Merchant, Ricky Gervais and Karl Pilkington
Oh, I also need to check my mailbox to see if my collectors box of MLP has arrived
Bronysith: Because Nocturne is lurking.
http://twentypercentcooler.net/post/show/21299
superretroworld: yes
otakon: first time we couldnt play was because we only had 2 computers
Randomnerd: Ive watched the show, but dont recall that
/me licks ponibas s mane
Bronysith: you couldn't play a ONLINE game bc you only had 2 PC's? that makes n sense
otakon: and now because of stupid ques and shit
sagas: ah
superretroworld: you must or die
...................
Bronysith: well that sucks
otakon: well we never played all 3 together before
Because we in Australia are quickly receiving our MLP dvds
/me licks ponies47 s mane
Bronysith: ah
sagas: umm... do you tell the truth?

APS|Evil: stop that!

APS|Evil: Good. :)
otakon: Cough Airpuff
RAWRity: Ah you know what you are doing
sagas: oh so the trick is to know which person is telling thr truth right?
/me hands a sworry cookie to SaxyPretender

superretroworld: yes you must figure that out with one question
/me bakes a oreo cake for the people of Bstate
Wrek how can I join your tf2 server
heheheheheheheheehehehehheehe!!!!! :D
sagas: and you are you asking, the truth guy or the lie guy?
hahahahahahaahahahahahaaah
dat CCCP

05Bluestrom_S: Open consoel and type in connect 109.169.46.134:27015
time to watch accel world
who*
superretroworld: You pick which to ask
.
superretroworld: Want to know how I would do it?
..
sagas: do you tell the truth?
superretroworld: The liar would say yes and the truthful one would too
Barn door plank.
Dat Face: ding a door. One will always tell the truth and one will always tell a lie. You have to go through the door guarded by the one telling the truth. You only get one question and it must be yes or no. What do you ask?
whoops
thanks Wrek
sagas: i give up, whats your solution?
Dat face: http://c.mhcdn.net/store/manga/8945/031.0/compressed/k012.jpg
RAWRity: What colour is the sky?
superretroworld: Ask one of them "does 2 + 2 = 4?"
Meanwhile: it has to be a yes or no question
Spoilsport.
RAWRity: Is the sky blue?
dat face indeed xD
sagas: okay, then ONE would say yes(and thus could be lying) and the other would say no(thus HE could be lying)
sagas: why?
sagas: so you still haven't elimanated the liar
otakon: The liar would say no. Truthful would say yes
sagas: but the liar would say yes as well
so the lesson is to trust noone?
otakon: No that would be telling the truth
otakon: no, the liar would say 2+2 isn't 4
because that would be a lie.
^
IF I SAY YES, I COULD BE LYING
IF I SAY NO, I COULD BE LYING
No, I know 2 + 2 = 4
6_9
otakon: Is the sky blue?
otakon: no, if you say yes, you said something that is true
/me facepalms
Meanwhile: no
trust yourself lol
One ALWAYS lies and one ALWAYS tells the truth
I want ponies!. :[.
sagas: yes
otakon: Not taking your door then.
sagas: what if they both lie?
MahBoi777: then they are breaking the rules
Devonx25: YOU NEVER ASK FOR PONIES! NEVER NEVER NOT FOREVER GODDAMMIT!
MahBoi777: We wouldn't know that.
Y!?
.
nope
MahBoi777: yep
Devonx25: Because you'll get G3.
Y!?.
G3!? FUCK NO!?
sagas: oh I know they'd be breaking the rules, I agree, but we wudn't know it
Door A says Yes. If he's telling the truth, then he would still say yes. HOWEVER, the liar would tell the OPPOSITE answer i.e. No.
Now we're gonna get G3.5!
otakon: So why can't I ask if the sky is blue?
MahBoi777: Then the scenario is pointless
Meanwhile: bc it's not actually blue
I GET G3, I GET PISSED!.
I am BEST MEDIC
I GET G3, I GET PISSED!.
otakon: Fine. Is grass green?
Devonx25: then you'll get kicked
sagas: ow mah head
I WANT G4 PONIES!.
Meanwhile: not always, once again you need a concrete answer
MahBoi777: Breaking the rules of the test would render the test pointless
Okay, this will be my first time playing TF2...
Devonx25: well then go to youtube
NOT G3!.
sagas: so u shud trust noone right?
DocSane: Play medic. Easiest class to play.
MahBoi777: One doors suppose to lead to heaven and one hell
Devonx25: We get it :|
Devonx25: dude, they will BAN you for making a ruckus about it. we show ponies tomorrow
Devonx25: We get it :|
MahBoi777: then youre just fucked
otakon: Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh. Is a circle round?
how about Dan Vs?.
sagas: well ya got a 50/50 chance, that's better than nuthin
There are so many ways to break that riddle.
Devonx25: just calm down, we don't show ponies all the time. it's usually streamers choice and demands are usually not met
i can watch this. i just sayin.
World's Biggest Tea Party please. :D
what was the chat room for technical problems ?
MahBoi777: Then its just a guessing game and the brothers might as well not be there at all and just 2 doors
Devonx25: Then sit down and watch.
wtf is dat blue thing!?.
Here's an easier one: You're on a path when you get to a fork in the road. One way leads to a village of people who only tell the truth. The other leads to a village of people who tell only lies. At the fork, you meet somebody who is from one of the 2 villages. How do you get him to lead you to the village of Truth speakers?
Oh My God. That Tag.
Meanwhile: Both doors will say yes. One will be telling the truth (yes=yes) the other will not(yes=no) that's how.
Devonx25: Protip. Never ask for anything unless the streamer says they'll take requests.
otakon: when does mlp ever come on the streamer
superretroworld: Friday night, saturday afternoon.
superretroworld: usually only on official movie nights
ask him to take u to his billage.
kool
village*
RAWRity: ask him which way leads to the village of liars
otakon: Who is to the when where?
Meanwhile: why
RAWRity: Which way to the village you are from?
sagas: okay, so how wud u tell which one is lying?
Get on top of that cart!
otakon: won't work. If he tells the truth, he'll point to the village of liars. If he tells lies, he'll point to the village of truth speakers.
otakon: you mean after when the movie done or on movie nights?
RAWRity: Mine works, right?
sagas: yes.
:)
Theys show an ep after each movie
superretroworld: after the A movie and then after the B movie
Im a little logic twilight sparkle
I love these
kk
:1
How does new meat even get here during the week.
Damn that cart went FAR
It's beyond me.
RAWRity: goddammit then I'm stuck
Meanwhile: no idea, but its always nice to see new people here
otakon: ask "which way to your village?"
well there was one guy last night that said he was arguing on some forum and they directed him here :/
Okay... Something went terribly wrong with my mouse.
Is there a stream?
RAWRity: but you STILL don't know if he's from the village of liars or the truth speakers then
Reikim: eeyup
MahBoi777: odd
Reikim: refersh mate
Ponies47: What is it?
brb
otakon: yes it is
If he's from the truthful village, he'll point to the truthful one. If he's from the Liar village, he'll point to the Truthful one, as pointing to the liars one would mean telling the truth.
Reikim: Wrek is playing TF2
Hello Everypony !
:)
otakon: it doesn't matter. Either way he points you to the truthful village, and thus his own place of origin i irrelavent.

HEY GUYS GUESS WHAT
I can make the pics rather easy, its just time consuming...lol
WindWhistler: What.
WindWhistler: What?
WindWhistler: What?? o.o
WindWhistler: What's up?
FUCK!!!!
Today, I got something awesome...I'd been wanting it FOREVER
???
WindWhistler: What?
Devonx25: Dat Mouth!
WindWhistler: What was it?
what is it?
lol.
I FINALLY GOT SUNBURN!!
I mean the character.
WindWhistler: Not gonna lie. I laughed.
WindWhistler: O_o
ohh
There's a character named Sunburn
Hey everypony, WindWhistler has sunburn.
Slap her.
for Skylanders.
Oooohh!! rofl
teh choo choo.
GUYS!
WindWhistler: Yay Sunburn!
hey
WindWhistler: Ahhhh, sunburn. That's too bad wait Meanwhile why would I slap her?!?!
otakon!!!
Lol I realized it would sound like I got Sunburn.
Steam is having a HUGE sale on Deus Ex Collection!
Lol Meanwhile
15 bucks for ALL of the games
I mean I have sunburn
otakon: :o
otakon: Buy it. Buy it NAO
and the addons for Human Revolution as well
wtf is the choo choo doin?.
But I'm talkiung about the CHARACTER for Skylanders~
I had a sunburn once
otakon: Buy it filly or razorfist will kill oy
05THAT IS THE MOST WORTH SALE EVER
you*
Reikim: what, you never slap someone with sunburn? your handprint totally sticks.
otakon: No way! :O
He's soooo awesome~
05GO AND GET IT
05DONT PLAY INVISIBLE WAR
Reikim: can't run HR.. already have Deus Ex
OMG...THIS SONG HAS REVEALD LIFES MEANING TO ME
Wrek: I like Invisible War, played it on the Xbox
Omnipony: this may sound really stupid, but is this the real omnipony?(the one who made pewdie's dub remix?) or are you just using his name?
plus, kind of borke
*broke
This is what I got: http://images.wikia.com/spyro/images/b/bf/Sunburn_01.jpg
thought you guys would like to know though
otakon: This is sad.
Isn't he sooooo cool?
otakon: "I like Invisible War, played it on the Xbox" That was painful to read.
He's half-Phoenix half-dragon~
WindWhistler: Damn that's pretty cool.
Reikim: I got 39 dollars to my name, even a 2.45 dollar game is too much
gotta admit, that's pretty cool
WindWhistler: It looks like Spike and Gilda had a baby.
OH MA GAWD
Meanwhile: I DID like it, although universal ammo is still stupid
otakon: I thought you were going to walk to wherever to get a job?
Crono_brony: unfortuantley im not but i wish lol! I do DJ on the otherhand. I just am not as good and i havent made any mlp remixes
Wrek: Stop that , Invisible war is good on it's own merits. The hame has just different feel than Deus ex 1. People complained , and later when COD 1 came out a month later , no one had anymore rage to strike the TRUE enemy
Reikim: didn't make it to Cambridge, too damn hot
Alister[M]: you watched Razorfist too didn't yo?
05Alister[M]: had they removed the deus ex part of the name i would forgive it
Alister[M]: (\
All the dragons in Skylanders look awesome
omnipony: aww! well thanks for telling me! XD
Wrek: that's what they did with Project Snowblind
SOLRAC is so FUCKING awesome!!!!.
Man you got signed.
no problem but I want to make music like he does lol
Wrek: THAT was originally gonna be a more action oriented Deus Ex, same universe too but they dropped the name.
Devonx25: hay yeah, he is!
http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120130082246/spyro/images/3/31/Skylanders_year_of_the_dragon_pic.jpg
wait, Wrek is no longer branded?
okay, hwere the HELL do they get the audacity to charge the SAME PRICE for a digital version of a new game?
otakon: Give them your money.
Wrek: Well , that sounds unfair. Play the game again. But keep in mind each game has it's own feel. Deus ex 1 is a conspiration story . Deus Ex 3 is more socio-political and Deus ex 2 a sci-fi story.
ALL your money.
Muahahahaha
Etc.
Hi all :)

Hello Irish_Pony.

WindWhistler: Very true.
Crono_Brony then why not try something on an electric piano? That's what I do :3

WindWhistler: I caRE! it looks cool
Meanwhile: it was console first, you PC elites had to BEG for it
Dark Souls...kind of want that game.

otakon: I don't even like Dark Souls.
Reikim: It isn't worh it
Meanwhile: your loss, good game
Alister[M]: Mmm. Why?
otakon: Nope.
PONIES!!!!
Reikim: It's a rather linear dungeon crawler that passes difficulty as depth.
Wrek: I've already played and beaten it, but I wonder if they'll release the new bosses on LIVE and PSN for free for owners of the original...
Biglaw: Cuz', i can't T.T i'm very bad with instruments other than the bass guitar, and pc synths!
Alister[M]: it's not THAT linear
otakon: Oh yes it is
Well, g2g. Bye everypony.
Bye ZappyTheUnicorn.
Alister[M]: Hey, there's depth, and then there's just having fun with a challenge. I enjoy both.
Implying linearity makes it bad.

Dat wombo combo.
Devonx25: dude, too many auto kicks and you'll be banned

Biglaw: I try and try! i just end up stressing myself out! (Don't worry, i don't rage and throw stuff. ^.^;)

Devonx25: otherwise you'll get not just banned but permabanned
05Devonx25: last warnign from me. go and read the rules. behave in chat. atleast act with manners. or get the hell out
Devonx25: they'll just keep banning you
Devonx25: That was not a smart thing to claim.
Devonx25 Is just trying to get attention do not bother listening to him
Biglaw: I love how you want to help, my fellow brony, but i just ended up taking a break. ^.^;
Why are we attempting to sort this muppet out again?
Gunthler: ponies
Devonx25: If you ban evade, its a permaban
Devonx25: many have claimed that and all have been banned over and over ad infinium
Crono_Brony alright then, but if you want help with anything just give me a shout
Devonx25: please don't, for your own sake eh?
otakon: who cares about his sake.
05evadign a ban onyl puts you on the permanent pan list

Biglaw: Of course! ^.^ thanks!
MahBoi777: Ponies! <3

otakon: If even he doesn't, why should anyone else.

Oooo.... is someone about to get banned?
Devonx25: well, all you got to do is NOT spam and constantly demand ponies. just act with some civility and you'll be fine
hopefully not RX-78-SweetieBot
RX-78-SweetieBot possible
13otakon this is the internet
RX-78-SweetieBot: hopefully not
13randoms don't understand how to do that
otakon if you try and convince the dense to not be, you're gonna have a bad time.
Shizuka: still, I act with civility so it's not an impossible thing
Why would you hope for an idiot to NOT get banned?
Shizuka this is otakon, he does not understand that
What's a civility?
:D
im not demanding ponies! :'( Im just yelling PONIES!!!! :[ :D
Biglaw: saying pleasue is just as funny as saying smuerpan. XD
13CriticKitten: it's when you glitch your tf2 class into the reference pose
CriticKitten: I think it's a kind of food? 6_9
13there's like... two people here that get that reference..
Devonx25: WE GET IT! You like ponies!
Shizuka: Civilian heavy is best heavy.
Shizu: Oh....oh.....oooooooooh.
Devonx25: well, still doing it over and over is disruptive and annoying is all eh?
Meanwhile where was Gondor during all this madness?
13Devonx25: I will not warn you again.
calm down Devonx25, don't get banned
Devonx25: we all like ponies here, that's why we're here

otakon: Bollocks.
Meanwhile: a wally?
13Meanwhile: it's kind of like watching someone about to throw themselves in front of a bus... you may not care, but there's always some tiny portion of the brain that demands you prevent it
lol wally
Shizuka: lol
Shizuka: Says you. I'm a helper, I'd shove.
the... m-moon?...
Shizuka: that is a apt description actually
0,14Mainly because they're going to make that bus late
Meanwhile: I'll drive the bus

13saxy confirmed a redditor

SaxyPretender: you evil and thus I blame you

so celestia won't send me to the moon?.
I just wish there was a copy of it
Seriously, I look forward to the day I am done with this summer semester. It's gotten to the point where I've started to hate handicapped people, simply because I know them getting on the bus will slow us down.

ponies47: it must be capitalized! NOPE.AVI
SaxyPretender: I gotta argee with you
we've kept our hoovsies warm at home
Devonx25: doesn't work, no vocal cords. watch out for the auto kick and stop if you get asked to.
SaxyPretender: I get to wake up at 7:00 am mon-fri, catch the bus at 8:30 after walking half a mile to the bus stop. Then I get to the depot, get on another bus, ride that one to the end of the line, get on a connector bus, get to school just before 10:00 am. Then 2 hours of class. Then back on the connector bus, then the second bus, back to the depot for the 3rd bus, then a half-mile walk back home. In the middle of summer.
Crono_brony: Okie doki loki

RAWRity: but no, what I'm saying is that if you translated the plots into humans and human like things it wouldn't change the fact that the show is well written and acted.
08,01not to seem 1-dimensional, but i hope it's sex
Randomnerd: then yeah, raven squad is the game for you. it's a FPS, but then a certain points, you have to do RTS view for missions.
LOL
LOL
0,14...is this Dire Straits?
otakon: Eh, I don't think so.
08,01otakon: hmmm
08,01they would lose some of their inherent cuteness
saxy: I do't think so
08,01and charm
Meanwhile: how so? a few translations of the pony jokes and such and it would work
inb4 the convo becomes sex
Humans are too familiar. The anthropomorphic aspect is endearing without being uncanny valley.
wassup good people
MLP Humanized would resemble some weird child of Harry Potter and Avatar
0,14oh hai Dken2021
Howdy Dken2021!
08,01and also the fact that they're ponies, which is stereotypically a girly thing
Allo Dken2021.
hiya Dken2021
Reikim: the mods would'nt allow it to digress that far
lali'ho Dken2021
0,14I'm almost certain this sounds like Mark Knopler...
real ponies? wha?
SaxyPretender: how are you today?
08,01so i guess a lot of people wouldn't have the same kind of introspection and epiphany they have now when realising they like the show
ponibas: You haven't been around long, have you?
nothing much. Just watching Nintendo Direct.
Two great tastes don't always taste together, of course...
otakon: do u know Chanokun on youtube? if u don't u shud look it up
Hm
Chat derp
MahBoi777: never heard of him
hey Dken2021
08,01otakon: i didn't say "inherently"
Real ponies? naaaaaah they have to be magical you see
08,01i said "stereotypically"
ah, my space shuttle had an epic crash... the cockpit broke off and landed on top of the rocket tower lol
ponibas: big brother is coming back to oz
Reikim: off and on for about 6 months or so.. I'd have to ask Sumica when I started coming here
/me is NOT an Aussie
ponibas: oh lol
08,01i did say "inherent cuteness"
i've known Sumica for 7 years?
08,01and i do stand by that
ponibas: u said aussie aussie aussie tho? :'(
08,01ponies are cuter than humans
RustyMeat: Seriously, is that a fish?
indeed
ponibas: Yeah...the other day we digressed to interspecies sex...and this morning |Discord| shared with us his Lyra story...so basically just about anything can happen in this chat.
Its a turtle
00,10I would have to go in to my windows.old directory to check the masive log
Its a turtle Randomnerd
ponibas: u cant say then
08,01we tend to talk about interspecies sex a lot in here
That eats jellyfish
goodnight, everypony! i had a great chat with you all! ^.^
ponibas: u have to be aussie or live in oz
I think I was here for the interspecies thing
night Crono_brony take care
goodnight Crono_brony
08,01i think you guys are holding out on me with regard to your fetishes.
RustyMeat: lol, I DO hate jellyfish.
Night night Crono_brony!
0,14o_o
RustyMeat: dude, that turtle is DAMN scary
2,14 despite my best attempts to STOP that kind of talk in here -_-
I'm so confused @_@
Oh hey, Val's back.
08,01actually, let's not talk about that
00,10Is't that legal in your state too ponibas?
/me apologizes to Caramel
What's up, Val?
08,01panda: i will not
ohai Caramel
ohai Trident man
My brain hurts 6_9
hiya panda

what is wrong with the stream?
Otakon hey man! How you been?
08,01this isn't the place for us to be discussing that
Val is going to trident you.
PENGUINS
One does not simply capatilize otakons name...
Funfact: While Florida recently made bestiality illegal...the law says nothing about oral, and that loophole has apparently been abused something awful.
yeah, i don't get pings if you do
RustyMeat: PENGUINS WHERE * grabs his binoculars*
panda: just tab it
RAWRity oh dear god
RAWRity: ...Only in California.
RAWRity: TMI.
I'm done with tf2 for now
Reikim: Florida
RAWRity: hopefully not with penguins...ouch.

RAWRity: Well. You learn something new everyday I guess.
not leaving yet
MOVING ON!
0,14also, this music is so Western
0,14I liek it
no kidding
like I said before, MLP as humans would still work
And thus why Florida proves itself to be the worst state ever.
08,01tell you what, how about to keep this channel clean, anyone who wants to talk about sex, move it to another channel
08,01say, #stupidsexytwilight

0,14Money for Nothing

chicks for free!!!!
apparently TLC is doing a show and trying to show bronies in a negative light
0,14which was the very first music video to be done in CG
I think to top of all this cleanliness, we need a nice garden.
A show called "My Crazy Obsession"
otakon: This I gotta see.
otakon: we survived fox. we got this
/me plants roses around the chat
otakon: oh man those people are so wierd
0,14also, not-so-fun fact, the songs that I listed are the only ones I've heard >.<
I don't get way this website is called bronystate if this is website has more about gaming and watching nostalga than ponies?
apparently liking a cartoon that promotes frienship and being decent is a CRAZY OBSESSION!
yep
thats how it works
otakon: That's insane!
FancyDerpy: it's for bronies to come in and socialize
0,14well, FancyDerpy, if we just showed ponies, we'd call it PonyState
otakon: and eating toilet paper or drinking gasoline isn't. seems legit
SaxyJanitor: okay, show bronies?
0,14Bronies have other interests aside from ponies, like other cartoons
/me mows the chat's lawn
FancyDerpy: welcome to bronystate: where a bunch of stuff happens
0,14gaming, etc
Reikim|Gardener: YES! CLEARLY IF WE WERE ALL ASSHOLES AND DONNED FAKE TANS AND LIVED IN JERSEY SHORE WE WOULD BE NORMAL!
It's just not maidy without Nittany.
Meanwhile: agreed, but he's alseep
eh, fake tan is optional
I cant even Butler anyway, i dont have a liscense
if that exists >_<
Butler license......hmmmmmm
who needs a liscence when you got....
dohohohoho
FancyDerpy: I don't get why the thing at the place is a place at a thing doing the hokey kokey with a koala drinking whiskey from a hollowed out pencil.
Hay everypony.
Seriously, what's with that?
Meanwhile: are you drunk?

TOY_PON32: yeah you aint saving anything..
Brenna! *everpony
Shizuka: I'm inclined to believe regardless of what he says it'll end up beign the latter anyway.

The funny thing is that the people who made the brony song I've also seen thier sonic the musical (A live action little play) and pac man the musical ( stop motion musical)
Shamroc: I know ._.
i like proxies. they can get be by stuff. (but not this :().
I AM NOT A BRONY

Ah. One of the unexperienced who isn't aware that "Brony" is a unisex term.
and you needed to use caplocks for that Brenna ?
YES THEY DO
He i swedish 6-9

YAY

haha
im a brony.
hey Ponies47
13happy to
I liked the design of the 3DS
a pegisister is a female brony
ponibas|D3: mispinged, my apologies :$
This is just
It looks like a thinner version of my Pandora system
/me cheers the impending ban
Looks really really
Not the permahammer!!!
a female brony is still a brony
Thanks for the team fortress 2!
Brenna: The term "brony" is usually considered genderless.
i need an OC.
with LOL CURVES EVERYWHERE
fragile.
It does >_>
Meanwhile, why did you do that?
oh no who's gettin permahammered?
It's like in that song ''It's hard being a brony'' : They try to make it seem like it's worse ofr the girls. I'm pretty sure there is more social stigma for guys
I can't look
panda: Because that was pathetic.
05this song
Brenna: Meanwhile is right
At least the 3DS plastic was pretty good/thick compared to the DS/DSi
Devonx25: Did I hear OC drawing?
05imagine it to fit the image
yes. but think about it BROny
oh....man.
....
yep.
05that flutterhsy is the main char in the lyrics
Wait who's getting banned?!?! :O
pegiSISTER
eeeyup.
Wrek: my mind is blown
Ponies47: Devonx25
bunny_maid_luna : yep
who is getting banned?
Brenna: Why do you WANT to divide us by our sex ? what's next ? race ?
hey anyone see this new skyrim mod? Skyrim Online, #1 on the workshop?
bannhamer? oh nooo
what did Devonx25 do?
Kandarihu: Oh dear O_O
bunny_maid_luna : i need an OC.
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Spammed like crazy
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: bassicly said he was trying to ban evade
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Being generally annoying and not heeding warnings.
Devonx25 : Of coarse were all bronies, This website is titled brony state (int int!)
I say let brenna call herself what she wants ^-^
For dodging a timed ban
Alister[M] Its just a simple joke
ahh
i did nothing!.
Devonx25: How will this OC look like? :)
ah yes i am back once again
Brenna: Well it's not funny
panda: agreed
Prick: you're such a prick
/me is staying far away from the chat

BRONY'S AND PEGISISTER SHOULD NOT FIGHT

*Pegisister's
Bunny_Maid_Luna....i suggest holding off on that...cause i dont think he will be here much longer
bunny_maid_luna : idk. i just need 1.
ah yes, but everyone loves meh :)
Yeah! <3 and tolerate!
<3
I suck don't I :S
Shamroc: Okay :)
/me keeps a nervous eye on Shizuka
To think. I spent a combined total of nearly 7 days in self-imposed honor ban mode. And the day after I come back, someone dodges a REAL ban.
the more i get banned the more research i get done and the closer i get to getting past it!.
loving this, Wrek
EVERYONE THAT HAS A PROBLEM WITH FEMALE BRONY'S BEING CALLED PEGISISTER MAKE A :[ FACE
Er, well, it's kind of the same day.
13Turn Caps Lock off please.
Brenna: Call yourself whatever you want. Just don't any BS like Pegasisters got it worse

Devonx25: rather than being an asss about it, you've been asked not to come here by mods and even banned.. go troll someplace else
08,01i'm a-waitin'!

Hey, everybrony. :)

It has a higher screen SIZE
IowaBrony: good evening!

Brenna: eeyup CANTORLOCK! But it's fine :)
Thanks Kandarihu

13oh look
BRB
LOL 3DS XL
13you're already banned
Well, brony is a portmandeau between bro and pony. I've been trying to figure out a female equivalent term, but the only ideas I can think of are problematic.
Well, do that on the 3DS XL and it'll be perfect
:D
13oh he left
native res whee
I GOT MAH CAKE sorry about the cantorlock all my fellow brony's and pegisister's

You fuck with the mods. You're gonna have a bad time.
Wrek: no complaints here
The price of peace and freedom, I guess. Eternal vigilance.
11,01Hi.
Brenna: Because we are ONE community. We have no uses for gender or race.
hai Nittany_Discord
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTPqjKk_xCo
oh hai Nittany_Discord
Brenna, because it makes it seem like two different fandoms, also giving two different names based on gender is kinda annoying :|
Back :)
plus, Im pretty bro
08,01Brenna: why make the distinction?
I AM SORRY
My little pony Freindship is magic > Couse the older versions is to mainstream.

11,01Thank you <3
Personally I hate gender wars more than I hate race ones.
Demo time
:D
hey Nittany_Discord
*Does the Freedom Day
i gonna go to a diff chat room for a little bit
dance
Brony draws the horse!
hey Nittany_Discord!
hmmm
11,01Did I hop into a pegasister argument?
I can't believe this is happening to me.
yes
Sadly yes.
*sigh*
I lost BOTH of my Skylanders games.
Nittany_Discord: eeyup :(
Yeah nitt
WindWhistler: oh noes!
I think of brony as a mix between /b/ and pony. That's just me, though. That's why I call me as well as all female fans bronies.
WindWhistler: That sucks.
We dun scared the newbie
So I bought that figure for nothing.
I have turned the house upside down looking for them.
hm
The only way I can buy another copy of either is to get the whole starter pack again.
11,01Everypony is a brony no matter what gender. End.
11,01K?
WindWhistler the toys or the discs ?
I say everyone should just call it what they want....
Thank you!
K
Meaning I have to pay $120 again
so
i think of brony as.....wait......THIS ARGUMENT IS REALLY STUPID
IowaBrony: but that analogy implies that we browse /b/
I'm watching Puella Magi
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: the disk and the game card
11,01WindWhistler: You lost it?
I lost the 3DS game and the Wii game
I demand strict definitions for made up terms!
Nittany_Discord: Yes yes :)
Can we just ssssh.. wwatchign somthing here -.-
11,01You misplaced it?
I have NO idea how the Wii game went missing.
WindWhistler ouch
im back
chat derp
SMASH
FOUR
OMG
I KNOW I put it away with the other games
wb Brenna
05also a sogn that fits
:|
:O
But I have no idea where I last put the 3DS game...
11,01I'd try to get a spare since you have proof of reciept.
WindWhistler: what game?
This. Sucks.
WindWhistler: Could someone have moved it?
Im still upset
11,01*receipt.
ugh
it was just partnership
What paint program is he using?
Meanwhile: That's what I thought, but no one in this family cares about anyone but themselves. Everytime I'm looking for something and ask one of them, they always say "no" before I can even finish.
stuff
that was lame
WindWhistler: trace your steps, perhaps?
oh
:<
IF I WANT TO BE A PEGISISTER WHY CANT I?
o.o
trolltendo
you can
go ahead
why cant you?
Brenna, i see nothing that can stop you.
Sylandest: It was too long ago to remember
AND NO ONE TELL ME TO COOL ON THE CAPS
So go ahead.
they better allow us to move ambassador stuff
WindWhistler: what game was it?
inb4 Wrek
Brenna: If you don't cool the caps you'll get kicked.
you can
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Skylanders.
So when adults got into MLP FiM, the adult guys were known as bronies and women were known as pegasisters. But the word pegasister was repulsive so the women started calling themselves bronies as well.
Brenna: You gonna get banned girl
I did it
^
Be right back.. I have to charge my laptop.. =/
Brenna, cool down the caps. Are you trying to caps me to death_
WindWhistler: hmm...perhaps a place where you put things meant for later? A spot that you dont always put thought to?
Brenna, if a mod asks you.. do it
?|
05Brony: term used to cathegorize fans of a certain show. unisex.
good
xD
05there's the definition
Am i gonna get banned?
WindWhistler: well that sucks
Newbies: they never learn
Kandarihu: I guess my argument is invalid.
Brenna: for allcaps
Brianna, call yourself whatever you like, just don't call me late to dinner
excess use of them
Brenna: If you continue to make a nuisance of yourself, yes.
Kirby Generations
/me hides
ITS NOT BRIANNA
Wrek THIS ARGUMENT IS REALLY POINT LESS
05and why would Brenna get banned?
Sylandest: No. I just put them wherever. I can't believe how stupid that was of me. The 3DS games are small. Someone probably threw it out.
Brenna: u won't if u don't all caps for every sentence, just sayin :$
gocry someplace else
And of course : since a mod said it, it's the truth
I'm gonna go take a shower. Be back in a few :P
Wrek, this arguemnt?
05JRP2234: HOW DOES THIS LOOK TO YOU? DOESA IT LOOK PELASEANT STOP THE FUCKIGN ALLCAPS
for callin myself a pegisister
WindWhistler: a possibility, but maybe not yet. I'd keep looking
What paint program is he using? >S
Wrek, you're scaring me :(
:S
But I have no idea where the WII game went. I put it with all the other Wii games, but then it's not there.
lol Wrek
thats why i would get banned
Wrek scares everyone
....
0,14As Liz from Shaun from of the Dead said, "Can we all just calm. The fuck. Down."
Sylandest: I've looked through everything like ten times.
I want my starfox U
Where did I go right ?
lol Saxy
SaxyCowboy: ^
Yeah this is beginning to drag. Put a sock in it.
mmmm..... brains
Well, I can't look in one of the places anymore because my brother has a bunch of friends over...
I agree SaxyCowboy.
nice one SAxtCowboy
05not bannable Brenna. but keep in mind many think the term is unizex and think that by adding a male and female term would cause sexism and stuff and too complicated to explain in one sentence.
05and for this discussin
05we will now drop it
Shut up guys. Just let it go.
05-----------------
agreed
fine
Thanks Wrek
WindWhistler: hmm...then it may really be gone, which is a shame. You do have the receipt, correct?
You don't agree, that wasn't a suggestion.
That was an order.
ty Wrek
I love how I heard almost nothing about Kirby's 20th
im gonna go back to my pony documentary
And this is something I should get worked up over. Because if I have to replace them, I'm going to have to spend a LOT of money for things I already have as well.
:C
New conversation time yay!
I MEAN BRONY
13IN OTHER NEWS
13if you haven't bought and played Quantum Conundrum yet, do it
