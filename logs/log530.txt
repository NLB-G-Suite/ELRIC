I have a thing against covers...
:$
I actually kinda like the song :$
/me has heard one really good cover of this song by Pentatonix
Sure I have a ton of ideas.. but I feel like my writing is all in vain, which pushes it all out of the way
brb

Bye guys
ugh, please. I refuse to watch 'em.
ooh
party.mov??
if anyone here has seen apple.mov you would know:)
People always say 'I watch each of them and I regret it'
The Asus Infinity Pad is only 500$ for 32GB of storage and 650$ with the dock
Watched it earlier, awesome :D
03though they update it a lot, and I don't feel like updating it for oyu guys XD

03uh
i watched party.MOV, it wasnt that well entertaining...honestly i keep my distance to these kind of videos <.< xD
10Like, in terms of students/size
03at first yeah, but it got fairly overwhelming
03ah
03well I went straight to a huge school which was kind-of a mistake
03if you're going to a smaller place it shouldn't be as bad
10The one I went to yesterday was HUGE
10it scared me
LOL
good to know
03heh

03<HyperMetalLugia> The Asus Infinity Pad is only 500$ for 32GB of storage and 650$ with the dock <- "only"?
Yep
I liked it. But I'm Belgian. I like everything messed up.
Listen to him
03yeahn

03I wish I had done that

Didnt progress the story in anyway
10I hope I get accepted into the community college then

10I won't use Calc in Accounting.
03I know right
10It's basic numbers
/me searches for a "Take into account" joke that could fit here...
but it still is 'the same ending' regardless ... with a few cutscenes at the end
10What classes do you need for IT?
Behind the bat :(
10inb4 all computer classes
07even more math than accounting
03>Still requies math
07|D
and they aren't different.
10cry
hmm
03well
But I liked it!
03at least with kettering, I only need "3 math classes" and not "calc 3+4+something else"
:D
Oh, and you have the options to shoot the kid or deny any choice too
03since I already have calc 1 and 2 from AP/community college credit
Dronk
that was a fun addition
03of course I just failed matrix algebra x.x

The reason why FiM fandom is seen as transgressive is because it's okay for girls to like boy things (Since it's aspiring to be stronger and boylike), but boys liking girl things is discouraged (Since it's seen as boys lowering themselves to be weak and effiminate)
lol
I'd run up to my friends and tell them ''I wanna talk about my feelings'' , I'd be laughed at and FOR GOOD REASONS ! Guys have to be strong

All the songs from the year 08
03LOL
03free listings because they like me
the song is "blame it on the pop"
:O
02LOL, how do you get free listings? XD
Really?
nighty night erryponi
take care, i'll definitely see you all tomorrow at movie night I'm sure
03-j
I personally don't like pop
It's not all the songs, but the songs that were popular that year.
00,10Video is Blame it on the Equine
Cool
02ah
03and then they're like "free listing specials"
takes no talent
and get the card from you that way
03well
xD
oh
03like I'd literally get penalized for listing one
03I mean
Well
hi
03if you were to buy it within 2 seconds of me listing it
You can hide it.
03but even then
And list it as SD Card
03ebay has a tendency to remove COMPLETED listings
03like
i don't like these songs, but the mix is nice.
03and then I get "this item was removed because it violated our OEM software policy" after the dude ships it
03>_>
Ouch
03which is dumb XD
03but yeah I suppose I could list it as an SD card
/me turns out to be a terrible night
Or
In one week, they raised $650K.
just a DS card
03with a 'free gift'

/me nailed it!
03plus I don't want to make you pay $20 for it XD
hey is anyone else looking into Mechwarrior Online?

03I blame my grandma
03she gave me one of those prepaid Visas when I was like 16
and then getting girl into the cockpit
03ever since I was like "these are awesome" and would buy my own using cash

00,10he just casaly walks along the hull of the ship to get back to an airlock
and then I thought "so why do they even need ships, except to carry all their guns?
to carry all the mechs!
and to make travel easier.. Imean hey, we could walk everywhere, but it's easier to drive

00,10lets build a city then put a ship around it
BRILLIANT
busted!
no variable wings yet. Much less, you know, transformable parts.

Not to mention I don't think piloting something that proppels by its feet is the best of choices.

00,10defentaly
...
00,10probending served only to introduce the brothers
Honestly, the pro-bending thing would have made for an interesting background thing, but we got 3 episodes dedicated entirely to the thing.
and that honestly wasn't necessary.
i really liked the pro-bending
as a world detail
00,10oh it was good.
It's certainly a neat idea
oh crap its ghandi
He's old, then
and I liked it.
I liked it, alot, but it didn't do that much for developing the story
00,10but from a limited story point her joining it was all they realy needed.
I still haven't watched the finale ;-;
'cuz that was a hundred years ago
but it had no real effect on the story otuside of introducing Mako and Bolin
it was nyquil
no go to sleep

OK. Even I, whoo think raw fish with hot sauce is one of the great dishes of all time, got nauseated by that.

that would have worked well
Zuko and Iro are such a great pair.
and given how much they had to do, there's no real side stories like in airbender
These chakras are really easy to unlock

People should learn to kickstarters....
00,10aang is realy in touch with his spirt side........or the guru is dat good.
Nuu
Because
aang IS spiritual
though to be fair, in airbender they were traviling across the world and just happened across many things, kora happens within the confines of one city
Korra is Physical

Thus, letting go of Katara wouldn't mean to stop caring about her. It would be about putting his role as the avatar ahead of her.

Hi everypony :D
Slight deviation from the manga there (probably to lighten up the tone), but still pretty good.

3yeah, before the cardgame was announced, this show was totally different
lol
Saturn: -lol XD noo no no no no no
the title "king of games" makes more sense here than the other show

08,01Shamroc: do you accpept mastercard?
I gun... FINALY!
:(

00,10well the whold deadly games thing was more intersting then they pulld screw the rules i have money.
08,01Shamroc: balls, i'm out of change. can i pay you in goats?
Saturn: Its a condemed image. I may post it later. Or whenever I find a way to censor it down XD
sooooo
Saturn....we do not accept substatutes.....cash only please
Yumi is creepy, and gives a good reason to him being a fighter instead of the normal kind hearted yuugi
(so naturally, being a total nutcase as I am, I prefer the manga one....but creativity points for that last episode, it's pretty cool)
Night all
kid if u esnt frends becom a borny
Oooo!
I know which one this is!
I might get the manga if I get some money
and hold our hands in harmony
Isn't that right, fellows?

08,01Shamroc: is that where the other inmates force me to "hug the salad"?
Yugioh season 0?
/me sigh
3I never understood why Yugi wears a collar. x3
Saturn: oh no....all salad hugging is completly up to you.....
It's a pity he didn't keep making up games.
08,01SlurryMoon: because collar
3my it's like symbolism... like he's a slave to his fate
tritins name is honda
:3
do people still watch this?
shhe works thaer
I feel sorry for Yuugi, a slave to his destiny/fate (talent)
Saturn....buuuuut since this a first time offense i'll let you go with a warning......just make sure you can afford you're free hug next time
yes
Lol
Why else do you think Saturn has rings?
3OH Miho...
00,10mishia it's fine it's just an image
I can haz cheeseburger?
:)
NANI
It's full of air!
the best thing you can steal.
08,01CriticKitten: saturn's rings are for a very specific purpose
but yeah Saturn.....wait here i'll pay for the next few free hugs..
sigh. too much buffering on my end

THis is common, in "junior high" you can't have a part time job, but often in "High" you can. Why, I never figured out.
