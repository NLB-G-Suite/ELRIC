YAY!!
So much less sadness
one of my favorite pmvs
ponibas|anime: but its only 4:12pm
Where's the funny stuff, this can't be starring Will Smith
woops
Yep. This PMV blew me away
or not...
whoa
I like dash's determination
Ponies47: its only 4:12pm
I downloaded this video just so i could extract the MP3 from it :)
its only 3:12 here Spectrum_Rush|Zzz
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: Then why you Zzz?
Dash's Determination was cool. At least its on my favorite list.
first PMV i saw here
flutter_spin mine too:)
damn i forgot how powerful twi magic can be
:3
/me loves Cosmic Love
XD
Ponies47: on my mac, the nick, i dont bother changing it
My cousin said "Its about time you got around to listening to Florence and the Machine"
we so need a bad guys marathon
see all the magic
10drf, nope @ Draw Something
:D
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: Okie doki loki
she could actually probely if the show is rated a bit higher kill a villian with it
QuickThinker: She can shoot lasers, how can she be weak?
flutter_spin: Have you listened to her new album?
i said i forgot
MadSurge I really like the Voice and the Drums in this song
not that shes weak
lol. I'm kind of strange when it comes to music. I have to like the music TO something.
Young Luna is pretty :3
in fact twilight reminds me of well me
<<<This is really well done
first PMV i saw here
yes
alexxm mine too /)
the editing with the clips is very professional
(\ Lil_B
I need more fandom exposure
For example. I super love Chrono Cross, not because the music is awesome, but because it was the game I played during my family's RV trip. It was the ONLY thing that kept me sane.
Man this is awesome
GET SUM FRIENDSHIP!!!
VIDEO NAME PLEASE!?!
so the songs is saying the stars read our destiny is waht im getting from it
hi Big_Macintosh_1992
Draw something
Sounds funnnn

Now I have Chrono Cross music above all other
Scoot-Scootaloo: Name of video?
Can't remember which PMV I saw first, but this is a good one :)
hey Big_Macontosh_1992 hows your day been
hey CCCP!:)
I have wi-fi so I guess I should download it; is there a free ver?
QuickThinker: The song is actually about a young woman who is in love with a young man, but the man doesn't know it
00,03The stars will aid her escape (cosmic love)
my first PMV was dash's determination lol
pretty good alexxm. Get to go to work in a half hour though
Video name is "The Stars Will Aid in Her Escape"
Muffin0: Hello derpy-me
Scoot-Scootaloo: Thank youi

BRB got an idea for music, must write to remembet :)
What the name of the original song?

I have a thing against covers...
by Gotye CCCP
:$
/me glomps Sylandest
I actually kinda like the song :$
Ehhh. My day is off and on. I wish I could get my writing mojo working again. I just don't have the motivation this week.
/me has heard one really good cover of this song by Pentatonix
Sure I have a ton of ideas.. but I feel like my writing is all in vain, which pushes it all out of the way
brb
QuickThinker: http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/3530822107858769221/ 4th comment

The Asus Infinity Pad is only 500$ for 32GB of storage and 650$ with the dock

flutter_spin: PARTY.MOV is the most gross so far, AVOID IT.
10Like, in terms of students/size
i havent seen i see the cover and a ssume its a bad brony
03at first yeah, but it got fairly overwhelming
03ah
03well I went straight to a huge school which was kind-of a mistake
lol MadSurge. I'm resisting
03if you're going to a smaller place it shouldn't be as bad
brb watching party
10The one I went to yesterday was HUGE
10it scared me
LOL
good to know
03heh
this is a good PMV
RIGHT!!!!!!!
Welp time to watch it.
lol!
is that you scoot?
to late
Yep
I liked it. But I'm Belgian. I like everything messed up.
Listen to him
10My mother agreed, "You'd be better off starting small,"
nooooo. I love the PMV but dislike the song
03yeahn
I love this pmv
03-n
He speaks wise words
Scoot-Scootaloo: You're giving proof to the saying "There's no such thing as bad publicity."
03I wish I had done that
/me nuzzles Scoot-Scootaloo.
I'm doing it Scoot-Scootaloo.
If only he warned me 15 minutes ago :(
Didnt progress the story in anyway
10I hope I get accepted into the community college then
there was 1 line in it I liked
Scoot-Scootaloo: TOO LATE I watched it :D I'll live though
03I actually transferred to a smaller school but lost a year of credits in the process
10Cuz the other nearest two are universities (4 years)
papercraft world of MLP i approve
Call back the Capcom?
^
Scoot-Scootaloo: watched it a few hours ago. Still sane.
10How many hours a night did you spend on homework?
DONT MENTION IT :) Its bad...ugly and argh just nasty! :P
12too much, yet not enough :"D
Lemme download ewww ad ver
/me hides
Wait! What was the last video song?
10wat
crap. Now I'm never going to remember.
03well
True
03The honest answer is I mostly blew off homework and procrastinated which didn't go well :P
flutter_spin: Cosmic Love
10How predictable of you :P
Back :)
Brb
so i still think if the show was more or less a higher rating like maybe teens Twilight could kick some large ammount of ass
i like the felt animation in this PMV
12Sky, it depends on what classes you're taking
03hm, new Futurama tomorrow?
hey Ponies47
10Light
03I'm not a HUGE fan but I do like that show
It's paper, alexxm

03well a lot of it does depend on the teachers and stuff too
The rules, they be broken
inb4 the rules are broken
12if so, focus more on them
I don't get it.
Turn down volume now!
One does not simply break the rules
03my teacher for physics in college was awful so I ended up failing
HE BROKE THE RULES :[
User0: more like, CRANK IT UP!
03even though I got an A in high school physics XD
ugh, I don't like over-the-top rage
12like say: you understand and remember everything in history
hey EpicPwnTime3 hows your day been
ACS13123: not me here at work...
YOU BROKE THE RULES! :[
12and have trouble in math
USer0: do it to troll :p

flutter_spin: price?

12ofun :P
EAT THIS
10:<
Bonk
10I won't use Calc in Accounting.
The extended ending DEFINITELY helps explain the endings more
03I know right
Bonk
10It's basic numbers
/me searches for a "Take into account" joke that could fit here...
bonk
Bonk
but it still is 'the same ending' regardless ... with a few cutscenes at the end
This chat has been bonked
10What classes do you need for IT?
Behind the bat :(
10inb4 all computer classes
03>First semester of programming, my teacher tells us "The great thing about programming is you don't need to know math, you just have to know how to program what the math people give you"
07even more math than accounting
03>Still requies math
07|D
and they aren't different.
Scout Documentary
10cry
hmm
03well
Its the same ending, with different colors :P
But I liked it!
Giant head heavy
03at least with kettering, I only need "3 math classes" and not "calc 3+4+something else"
:D
ACS13123: next troll technique, draw ponies on the whiteboard in my cube...
Oh, and you have the options to shoot the kid or deny any choice too
Anybody have a whiteboard marker?
03since I already have calc 1 and 2 from AP/community college credit
User0: maybe... *sniff* maybe
Dronk
that was a fun addition
03of course I just failed matrix algebra x.x
Damn, Scout
>healthy addiction
12Orpheus is not pleased
/me hides
03I will say this much: Rate My professors is like the best resource ever

Scout is a loony.

This is a heart-warming story with three little ghost called There, Here and Where. They are not scary like usual ghosts but pretty and mischievous like human children. Of course they sometimes surprise people by disappearing or flying, but they are loved as children's friends.

00,10lol
02but really, you should watch a trailer or something :P
11,01I won't spoil it.
11,01It's a bad end.
00,10that's fine. poptops are easy, streetfights at a red light are hard.
13I don't feel like iiit~
13I already know spoilers from the anime as a result of random lurking anyway :P
Sumica: I think you used up your luck at a more optimal time.
just hit them with the car
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lhif1x_d_AQ&feature=channel&list=UL
Sumica: more or less. -lol you would be surprised how many things on a vehicle can be used as a weapon.
00,10learn to not link plalist
well
tbh
Sumica: I know. I build the metal bodys before shipping them off to the plants :D
I liked the first season but started going WTF WHY a
at the second
00,10Such as the tazer i keep in the door Iron_Edge
11,01Ugh. Still fighting food poisoning.
02R1 was better than R2
00,10ouch
Sumica: Exactly >:3 dude walks up on sumi BOOM Tazer to the chest!
Nittany_Discord: If you die, I will personally kill you!
Sumica: easiest way to win a redlight street fight, wait for the guy to get near your door then quickly open it so it hits him, then do it again when they colapse
hmm
http://youtu.be/Ef-C6cb0A0M
Poison ALL the food. What was it Nittany?
Nittany_Discord: Hope you get better soon. :(
11,01I ate uncooked chicken days ago. I was expecting to possibly get ill.
11,01I know.
How do you fix a nickname?
11,01I don't want to get sick.
Nittany_Discord: -lol any reason why???
02both are good though
00,10that also works but my prefered way was to put the car in reverse when he walked behind it.
02Since R2 has some pretty important stuff in it to the story line
11,01/nick <nicck>
Nittany_Discord: its ok, you'll be fine :)
DeadpoolDash: This is gooood
pony_188256: "/nick username"
00,10he ran so fast
11,01It wasn't raw.
pony_188256: Type /nick then what you want your name to be
11,01Just thawed pre-cooked.
11,01Still not smart by a mile.
Nittany_Discord: you might have gotten salmonella
especially if this is still affecting you
02and some people say they want a R3. I'm like lolwut
hey everypony im back
Nittany_Discord: Have you been to the doctor's? :S
11,01No.
ok, just watched party.mov :/ wasn't that great, only the end was kinda good
11,01I ate it days ago and have been fine.
with food poisoning you throw up and then a few hours later you're feeling better
11,01Only a bit sick now.
11,01Nothing bad.
Thanks
Magic: Sup bro /)
the key to fights, only fight when victory is guaranteed
also, bye everyone :)
bye Lil_B
'later Lil_B
11,01Like, just some bowel troubles.
Hmmm

Sumica: BRILLIANT!
DeadpoolDash: Sun Tzu said that
00,10The key to fighting is cheating
Who is going to stream next?
/me hugs Michael and MakerDusk ;)
Nittany_Discord: you're not convincing me it's not salmonella
I found a video I KNOW most here would laugh their arse off :P
watched too many mlp vids
It may be lupus
11,01What's the symptoms of salmonella?
Sumica: be the combat pragmatist
there is no cheating in fighting, everything is fair game
11,01I can't afford to go to the doctor TBH.
Wait, why did you eat raw chicken?
Vordox: show it :D
02Now a pre-R1 would be interesting
Fine...
I'll show it here
11,01I'll explain it.
FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKE EA!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-LE0ycgkBQ&feature=related
Salmonellosis (gastroenteritis characterized by nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) is the most common disease caused by the organisms. Abdominal cramping also may occur. Blood may be present in the feces.
"For people who like EA" So, nobody?
lol
Salmonellosis thus produces the symptoms that are commonly referred to as food poisoning. Symptoms usually begin about eight to 48 hours after ingestion of the bacteria.
>people who like EA
11,01It's been more than 48 hours.
you got salmonella, Nittany_Discord >_<

00,10Speaking of EA, the new me3 ending thing is out
00,03Son, you best be trollin'
Sumica theyre a little bit better
but stil not good enough
and the 4th new ending
03<BlueFlare> Since R2 has some pretty important stuff in it to the story line <- well yeah, but it just got weird
is just appaling
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: I don't have it saved.
yay, another set of color explosions, forgive me if I seem uninterested :)
almost time for Meet the Pyro
00,10is it the rainbow ending?
11,01MakerDusk: If I get worse, I'll go to the doctor. I'm still functional.
Hello! I'm new to this.
Ryunosuke actually, its the "fuck you im doing nothing" ending
CallofLukey: sup bro /)
the new ending is a troll ending
(\
and the new endings actually add alot of background which is nice
Nittany_Discord: Why wait? It may even be cheaper to go in for something not as serious.
but still stuck at the basic 3
CallofLukey: Wilkommen to the room, make sure you read the rules.
Nittany_Discord: you're as bad as I am... and everyone knows canadians have free health care
>_<
11,01Because I'm poor and have no health insurance
shepard basically tell the kid to screw off
03though fans were mad about the series ending, so they're actually making another OVA
Nittany_Discord: you poor thing
they also removed the detonations of the gates, theyre only damaged, not destroyed
brb
Spoilers much?
/me nuzzles Nittany_Discord.
please tell me you don't have verizon or comcast either >_<
oh noes, comcast
I hate it
11,01Hell.
WHY IS THE WORLD SO TRUE ON EA ON THAT VIDEO
11,01The ONLY options in State College are Verizon and Comcast.
Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!?

that's not a promotion
11,01Yeah.
03ahhahhahahahaha my geekiness is getting to me

03I saw a spam email called "Windows Installation", and they were advertising installing actual windows
03you know, like Wallside Windows/
03?
11,01The "I <3 the RIAA/MPAA" attitude of the govt makes me want to leave.
03but that term means somthing else entirely to me :P
see the problem with well.. anything .. here, is that the corporations are turning into monopolies... despite all the anti-trust laws
/me brohoofs any other canadians in the channel for that one
verizon owns comcast
02what does it mean to you? XD

03Assuming you're using the same method as everybody else, you'd be recording it uncompressed (as far as I know, all digital audio editors use uncompressed until your final export). All you have to do is save those as WAV - I pair them as stereo rather than one huge multi-track file (this is actually more ideal anyway, since the MOGGs you have to make stereo pairs each time you open it)
03I use FLAC (command-line program) to compress the WAVs. But I'm fine with WAV too - it just takes longer to upload and download... FLAC is like a ZIP file, it can be up to 40-50% smaller.
03Also, FLAC *is* mathematically lossless. It's like taking a WAV file and compressing it in a .zip archive. There technically IS such a thing as lossy FLAC but you only get that using third-party compressors.

Nittany_Discord: YOU are the source of your shame. Free yourself of your inhibitions, and you shall break the chains of insecurity for evermore.
RAWRity: it's another series. Battlestar Galactica.
lol
Kandarihu: it's called a joke.
His dress will be the outfit that will peirce the minds of bronies at BroNYcon!
RAWRity: Men do not look good in dresses.
Nittany_Discord: you're doing the right thing.
the original battlestar galactica, naturally not the recent remake
RAWRity: Well being a open Brony does give you balls, LOL.
11,01Though I offered to wear a maid dress for charity. Never raised the money though.
DocSane: clearly you haven't been seeing the right transvestites.
lol
wat?
Clearly
11,01I wouldn't look good in a dress.

no, was writing 'Bop' and accidentaly switched window
11,01I'm not thin, and I don't have long hair.
that announcer
now what we really need
Well, you know that John De Lancie is doing a documentary to prove that we bronies aren't messed up, right? Guys running around in drag kind of undermine that.
ill be back on in a bit
0,14oh
0,14XD
is ota in a dress
11,01Yeah Kandarihu
Nittany_Discord: well clearly there'd be some necessary prep. Shaving/waxing your legs and any other bits that aren't normally visible. Getting used to the heels. learning your cup size.
I'd might of pull off a dress when I was 150 and no muscles....not so much now. :P
You can't just expect to throw on a dress and look hot.
you've gotta work for it.
uh oh
the elevator
why the flying crap
I thought the point of this fandom was to like something identified as "girly" without being effeminate.
11,01RAWRity: Why?
does Skyrim require Steam?
maried one child XD
what bs
hello again elevator
>implying Nitt isnt hawt
03Steam is BS already
that .. civil war
Elevator time machine!
Married ONE child, didn't work out
DocSane: You could be still be girly. XD
lo
The fact that Skyrim requires steam
11,01I would try and attract people dressing as a chick.
when it's not even an online game
11,01That's not me.
is complete bullsh*t
03>always-on DRM
11,01Because I'm not a homosexual.
swag
Nittany_Discord: be careful with that. Bronycon WILL be taking place in Jersey after all.
>implying homosexuals all wear dresses to attract people
watching MLP would be consider girly for most people.
11,01Heterosexuals wear dresses for fun.
haha
lol
that they do
11,01Crossdressing doesn't mean your gay.
That brings up something I've wondered about: what precisely makes MLP "girly"?
ponies?
You know what? How about dressing as a butler or something.
DocSane: the lack of violence apparently
11,01I'm not dressing up for Bronycon.
that joke fail
otakon: But, it has violence.
11,01I'd rather not.
DocSane: I'm not saying it's girly but, someone who hasn't watched the show sees 6 main characters that are girls that are...ponies.
**female ponies.
hmm.... I wonder that myself, the ony thing I can think of is that its ponies and the main characters are girls, but thats about it
Nittany_Discord: alright. Cool
dat comedian
DocSane: bloody dismembering DEATH violence
japanese translator
for me it took a while to see apple and dashie as female
DocSane: it's got bright, pastelle color schemes usually associated in western culture with females. it has a predominantly female cast, is marketed towards young girls, and generally just has an aesthetic most often associated with girls and young women in the popular conciousness of western society.
11,01This chat went weird.
yep
Meh
The themes and stories it deals with are perectly accessible to boys.
so anyway
There are plenty of anime series with a primarily female cast that are targetted at guys. And not all of them are adaptations of Visual Novels.
i will be wearing a dress to broNYcon as consilation
DocSane: yes, but the presentation and the way it is marketed is focused almost solely on girls.
end of discussion
Kandarihu: That's anime, not western cartoons.
Nittany_Discord: i wouldnt XD
I dont think what show defines what sexual orientation you are
I'm generally more into anime than western animation anyway.
11,01I might even stream as a maid if you do.
RAWRity: Would you say that it's mainly girly in its visual indicators?
Kandarihu: I used to be, not so much anymore.
11,01You know, the thing people wouldn't donate money for me to do.
if you like a show, you like a show for what it is, no matter if its western or anime
Nittany_Discord: ...hmmmm interesting proposal...
the thing is
Gimme gimme gimme gimme
:(
DocSane: I suppose so, yes. Pink and purple (generally considered "girl" colors"), lots of butterflies and flowers and other such images generally associated with "girls" by our society.
now i need to find a dress that fits me within 17 hous
*hours
umm
before I go to Great South Bay
11,01I have to save for a proper maid outfit. They're expensive.
RyunosukeKnT: Pink is. Usually
for example, in the early 1900's pink was a boys color
RAWRity: I recall that Faust wanted to tone that down, but that Hasbro kind of insisted because it's just expected that a girl show have all that stuff.
/me scans the crowd for her pretty flower flanked filly, Shizu
Rain Rain~ <3
:p
she ist here Rain
D:
darn..
/me pats Rain "sorry"
is
ist = is
uh oh
ah, I thought you misspelled isnt
Grammatical logic ftw
yeah thats understandable :p
idk if shes AFK or not
ouch, that sucks
RAWRity: Gender is entirely beside the point in FiM.
RAWRity: I think the main point is, if you dont' know what it is. You'll assume it's just for girl but ify ou acutally watch the show. You see the truth. Least for most.
Hello everyone
^ DocSane
Hey Big_Macintosh_1992
What about Andromeda Shun from the original Saint Seiya? He wears pink, and he's arguably the most popular character in the series!
Note to self, dont trust a pupet
RAWRity: No story is ever driven by a character being a girl.
but it does avoid the 'girls do this' and 'boys do this' that way to many shows enforce
thing' not that
did my chat derp ?
11,01In the 1900s, boys wore pink skirts.
nvm
MegaM00k, mabey
Nittany_Discord: I wear pink shorts all the time XD
man im tired night everypony

the doc's
RAWRity: If there's a real girliness to the show, it's how it often concetrates on characters dealing with feelings.
that parking
uh oh
"girly" means that the it's made to appeal to girls, uses various tropes or familiar criteria that is associated in popular conciousness with young girls, or otherwise are made to appeal the the younger female demographic.
DocSane: Well everyone has feelings :P
oh noes
that crying
The doll sacrificed its body for Science
Crying Judy has something to cry about
Guys, I was being sarcastic. I forgot there no sarcastic button.
RAWRity: often associated, but not always parallel to
Poor car
11,01What should I do next?
the only emotions generally highlighted in shows marketed towards boys are anger, jealousy, and the glee of burping.
Nittany_Discord: Montage?
lol
glovebox
HA
>generally
not always
saw that one coming
:D
The reason why FiM fandom is seen as transgressive is because it's okay for girls to like boy things (Since it's aspiring to be stronger and boylike), but boys liking girl things is discouraged (Since it's seen as boys lowering themselves to be weak and effiminate)
lol
I'd run up to my friends and tell them ''I wanna talk about my feelings'' , I'd be laughed at and FOR GOOD REASONS ! Guys have to be strong
hes high
11,01Could try and beat that Hard Reset boss.
There incredible? Eeyup its drugs alright
03LOL Star Wars
RAWRity: on terms of gender roles then i completely agree then
lol
MegaM00k: "guys have to be strong". One, no they don't. Two, that implies emotions are equatable to weakness, which is inherently untrue.
because Society is like that :p
MegaM00k: lol but why would u ask them that
EVERYONE has emotions, and it's usually better to express them with those you trust rather than to bottle them up for fear of being percieved as "weak".
Well, men are expected to be stronger than women. Strong enough to withstand a double standard.
oh god
RAWRity: We need to be independant , feelings eren't bad. But being independants means learning to deal with your emotions yourself. Help is for the weak
11,01Ska?
ska
:D
MegaM00k: "help is for the weak." Tell that to me after you live in the woods on your own for a decade hunting your own food.
more like
thats how he stayed so young for so long
Dick Clark, ladies and gentlemen
skah
Because otherwise, you're getting help from SOMEBODY.
MegaM00k: ''help is for the weak'' oh ok when u have a disease dont bother going to the hospital
MegaM00k: Honestly, I think that has changes this past few years. Maybe that's just me.
Well, Ska caught on, but not exactly in a big way.
RAWRity: No , But I earn my own money

00,03O RLY..
MegaM00k, 'strong' does not meen 'never shares'
because otherwise, your employer is helping you by giving you a job and a source of income.
Help can only make you stronger

Did that just say....
poor Dog Girl

San Fransico?
RainBowJack: hay sweety ^^
Irish_Pony: That's whta I was thinking

i suspect i've been playing quantum conundrum too much. went to throw a cup away, thought about throwing it from a distance and shifting to anti-gravity and then shifting back so it lands in the trash can before i realized...i cant actually shift to anti-gravity
hi VioletGreySha
kinda sounds like japanese spike
00,10horly sheet you are right icybeauti
Ingwaz: lol, have you given the new Penny Arcade game a shot?

ohai Alicorn

00,10did't like that one
i did
Macvross Frontier
Yeah I should know the name of this thing
Ingwaz: turn based RPG from the guy who made Breath of Death VII and Cthulu Save The World
otakon: ah, i saw that on steam i think
Sumica: this new one is different in style, think FF5
Ingwaz: five bucks AND you get the other two games for free
that guy sounds like tomoya from clannad, probably same voice actor
mfw the Harry Potter books are 15 years old now
Ingwaz: but it's only good if you like 16 bit throwback RPG's
I ran into an episode title which literally translated as "Force uproar! The unseen threat."
Irish_Pony: Lawl I have to brush my teeth now
RAWRity: Animaniacs is 19
WET DOG GIRL!
I translated it as "A Disturbance in the Force! The Phantom Menace!"

I have no illusions at all that the client will change it to avid any hint of trouble.
Sumica : i got a new phone
otakon: eh, not to me. As a kid a lot of the jokes went over my head, and as a (supposed) adult, the jokes just seem dated and tired.

Ingwaz: it's only five bucks for 3 games, like I said if you like 16 bit throwback RPG's like Dragon Quest and the GOOD final fantasy games this would be good for you

THAT!?
OMG that
Dog Girl sings cat song
lol
otakon: well, as i said, i'll look in to it
It's not just Harmony Gold. There's a big legal tie up involving them and Big West over the rights to Macross
I respect that it was trying to provide humor to parents watching the show with their kids, but I feel they ended up harming themselves by making everything so timely that any relevance has since slipped into the recesses of time.
Ingwaz: well, don't delay too long the sale ends soon
NUNS!
otakon: ah, didnt realize it was an actual sale
RAWRity: Finger Prints is still funny
ni hai nyan!

oh that song...xP
dammit, now i gotta look up that song for taurus
dat mix
Best DJ EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!
oooo what the name of this video?
and I was just listening to the 'Biggest bll of twine in minnesota' in the car waiting for mum
can i make a request?
Dis music
DocSane: maybe, but I hope she gets her vacation
trhis is actaully a damn good mix job
smooth fades and transtitions
Gluepop: I think this is just a intermission between Robotech eps
Gluepop: Send it to vinly_scratch
otakon: I have a feeling she will live the rest of her life in quite a bit of comfort.
Best remix ever! :)
02maybe if it was on ebay I could just go "Look at these super cheap hard drives I found! :'D "
ok
Dat pokerface
inded
She can take a vacation from bus monitoring, that's for sure.
indeed*
DocSane: good for her
03um
All the songs from the year 08
03I could put it on eBay
03LOL
00,10it helps that the same group made most the samples ponibas
diabeetus
03free listings because they like me
okay guys, I'm gonna go to bed for the night
DocSane at 650k, she can retire
the song is "blame it on the pop"
:O
02LOL, how do you get free listings? XD
Really?
nighty night erryponi
whats the name of this PMV?
03you just have to be a seller for X amoujnt of time
take care, i'll definitely see you all tomorrow at movie night I'm sure
03-j
ponibas: She is retired. The bus thing is just a little busy job, it seems.
I personally don't like pop
It's not all the songs, but the songs that were popular that year.
Night CCCp
00,10Video is Blame it on the Equine
Cool
02ah
03and then they're like "free listing specials"
takes no talent
thannks Barbetos
Just a good sound guy
I could ask my aunty to set up an Ebay account
might be mostly black eyes peas riffs but still the mixing is flawless
and get the card from you that way
03well
Because parents dislike ebay
xD
03flashcards are banned on ebay
oh
.v.
03like I'd literally get penalized for listing one
03I mean
Well
hi
03if you were to buy it within 2 seconds of me listing it
You can hide it.
03but even then
And list it as SD Card
03ebay has a tendency to remove COMPLETED listings
03like
03I'd buy these Windows XP discs
i don't like these songs, but the mix is nice.
The whole things started a week ago to raise $5000 to send her on a nice vacation.
03and then I get "this item was removed because it violated our OEM software policy" after the dude ships it
03>_>
Ouch
03since ebay says OEM software must be shipped with hardware
03which is dumb XD
DocSane did you see what the oatmeal raised for like no reason at all??
03but yeah I suppose I could list it as an SD card
/me turns out to be a terrible night
Or
In one week, they raised $650K.
00,10I like when PMV makers make sure they use good quality sorces for the videos
just a DS card
03with a 'free gift'
/me runs
have one in the image
DocSane: great for her
03well I have to provide a photo
03XD
okay guys, I'm out for the evening take care all
And pretend it is that
night otakon
ponibas: No. Link, please?

00,10watermarks kinda bug me in videos
Sumica: agreed always good to see that

03you'd want me to list it for like $10? XD
HEY Ninjazz! how are ya?
Hey there, Mutterguy. :)
If I can talk to my aunt over the weekend

A MECH BATLLE TO THE FINISH
awsome, Japanese Anime, I can understand some of it!
warning your heat sink has failed
00,10remember always sream as you fire your gun for the first time.
you are now overheating
God, I wish I could just put out a pan handling request to the world and get a few hundred thousand dollars.
00,10er scream
i read that as percussion
Hey it's this song from Val's game!
/me cannot wait for Mechwarrior Online
02I have an idea, to save you the trouble I could just try to get my parents to buy your IBM 36.4 GB Internal Hard Drive item
lol, i know..
/me shall apply this rule next time he gets ahold of a fly gun
00,10indeed Ninjazz, macross F is in Superrobot wars
02then you could send me the 80 GB one
02XD
03uh]
o-o
/me recognized it :3
03but I'm actually trying to sell those IBM drives
thot it sounded familiar
03so I'd have to re-list it
03LOL
that makes 0 sense
/me nailed it!
Wait so what is the plot for this exactly?
Songs were great in that game, btw.
00,10Second opening song is better
03plus I don't want to make you pay $20 for it XD
hey is anyone else looking into Mechwarrior Online?
umm...
02I guess you're right XD
needs more existential angst.
i feel as tho I should know it.. tho it's been a while since i've seen thios
03you don't have any friends who wouldn't mind acting as a relay?
03like, someone who's parents don't care
click click.. no boom
00,10fool, guns run out in macross universe. use missles instead
Don't die!
00,10they never run out
02All my friends have parents who care XD
MMM!
02As far as I know
infinite missiles ftw
lol
Sumica: just punch everything.
macross missile mayhem!
Sumica: Oh, yes they do. Just not that often.
I imagine that's the only reason one would make a humanoid mech to begin with.
nom
00,10behold MMM
SON'T YOU DARE DIE GLOD DARN IT
03god parents are annoying sometimes
there!
03I just told my mom to stop whining XD
03because I mean
/me ooo's and ahhhs
cheats activated
02I could ask a few people, see if I'm right
03I'd buy prepaid credit cards and buy things online myself
00,10and then he over did it and poped her headoff.
03so if someone gave me something I'd say it was an ebay purchase
squish! "whoops"
And doesn't THIS seem familiar-- as rightout of the original?
this seems vaguely familiar
lol
Dat pricision.
00,10yes Kencolt, this bit is in ever macross
One slip and... pop.
hen3ry macross Frontier
Sumica: You're such a buzzkill sometimes
michael!
carefully lol
its how the audience knows who the chosen one is
Seriously though, whenever I see a Giant Mech show taking itself seriously, I can never get past the idea that somebody thought that humanoid piloted robots were worth the engineering adn designing nightmare, not to mention the cost, when strapping guns to conventional spaceships would be more effective
Sumica : Macross Plus is best poni
Gerwalks were NOT meant to be flown like that.
02that is actually a good idea XD
We decided to base our currency on Glod. they weren't happy about it. Also the the maintence of keeping them fed was astronomical. </terrypratchett_ref>
00,10even down to the lossing the arm the girl is in
OH NO
03I blame my grandma
Kencolt no
03she gave me one of those prepaid Visas when I was like 16
and then getting girl into the cockpit
03ever since I was like "these are awesome" and would buy my own using cash
the story writes itself in the sequels
GRAB HER DAMMUT!
seriously, I can't imagnie that ship is easier to pilot when it's being proppelled by its feet.
Don't DERP
Freaking reincarnation of the kid...
Ninjazz: wait for it...wait for it...
HE DERPED
oh noes
00,10spaaaaaaaaaaaaace
twist?
... dammit sumi
nice
If i was that girl, I'd be asking for new pantiesat the end of that flight. :(
we don't have those here x.x
there are no tunas in space this time tho
xD
03you sure?
Mutterguy: LOL
03check drug/grocery stores XD
00,10no but they still have the city inside a space fortress
Why is Sumi OC dancing like Twilight?...
was*
00,10why not?
of corse she was acsred
Good point.
Ninjazz who do you think taught it to Twi??
damnit, minmay! I mean... whatever your name is
XD
lol
00,10Ranka used rapewistle
STOP GROPING PEOPLE IN YOUR SPACE SHIP
AND OF CORSE THAT WHOULD HAPPEN
Ranka is, what? 14?
dat Ranka
00,10it's super distracting
Oh, come on-- Valk's with Giant Blazing SWORDS?
Sumica: Ranka uses love charm it's super effectif
hur hur hur, funny business in the COCKpit
lol candy
here's the scary part. We built these robots to fight Zentradi. But we kept them to fight... viruses.
00,10yeah but she's in his cockpit
actually I have no idea xD
RainBowJack I thought that WAs Kurumu?
00,10wrapyour mind around that
... or was it Kumuru??
quarter Zentradan. therefore ear drums no explody
friggen japanese dyslexia
You know the drill shower. Be back in a few :P
Damn...
hen3ry: Battroids turned out to be really useful for fighting the many, many giant space monsters in the cosmos.
A full zentradi can survive the vaccum of space unprotected.
00,10well in the first macross we see the Zentradi commander get blowen out in to space
yeah, I recall that
and walk across the hull of his ship
00,10he just casaly walks along the hull of the ship to get back to an airlock
and then I thought "so why do they even need ships, except to carry all their guns?
to carry all the mechs!
Sumica: That was Breetai. He's ain't a NORMAL Zentran.
00,10cause it's painfull to shove a drive core up your arse for thrust
hey, war is hell, right?
I can't help but imagine: how not-give-a-fuck and decadent is this place's government that they funded the absolute engineering disaster that is building functioning, humanoid space craft.
and to make travel easier.. Imean hey, we could walk everywhere, but it's easier to drive
hen3ry: They needed ships because they still need air and armor and thrusters in space.
Soooo Macross mod for Kerbal?
!ping
!pong
!pong
00,10they reverenginered it from alien tech RAWRity
... oooh
it's not an anime unless someone has purple hair
Build SDF-1...
RAWRity: The only humanoid spacecraft is the Battle Block of the Macross Frontier fleet.
00,10I would be more concerened with the City sized colonyships
game will lag to hell, but what the heck right?
lol
Sumica: wouldn't it have been easier to reverse engineer their guns and weapons, than strap those to their ships?
i'd rather build a valk
just sayin
00,10lets build a city then put a ship around it
BRILLIANT
busted!
no variable wings yet. Much less, you know, transformable parts.
shhh
Not to mention I don't think piloting something that proppels by its feet is the best of choices.
don't ruin it for me!
00,10easy fix hen3ry, attach wings to flaps
like, imagine having to figure out which way to turn your robot's left foot so that you don't spin out and die.
RAWRity: In battroid mode, it's propelled by the thruster pack on its back.
I love this BD
This military must have had a lot of brave test pilots.
i'd rather fly it in fighter mode anyway
RAWRity: If you need to go fast, you change back into a plane.
00,10indeed RAWRity
pimp puppy???
/me looks curiously at Pimp_Puppy_Luna
ponibas: Fighter is good for high speed hit and away combat.
ponibas: Sooo?
DocSane: not about going fast. It's about mobility. I can't imagine anything as needlessl complicated and designing a ship with the engines in its feet.
damn skippy!
ponibas: Battroid is for hand to hand combat with giants and extreme maneuvers in space.
Pimp_Puppy_Luna just wondering
actually with the whole Acrology ships I have to assume they're a bit more adept at manipulating gravity
Woof B)
00,10dat reffrence music
8Arcology ships
DocSane sue me, i'd like to see us doing this before I die p
RAWRity: The idea of a humanoid battle suit is that you can turn much faster than in a plane designed to mainly thrust in one direction
00,10well we do have exo armor in the works
ponibas buy shares in honda and toyota
whats this?
lmao... i pay almost 1200 a month in child supprt.. I don't do stocks
/me is away: I'm off doing other things; most likely sleeping or eating.
/me attempts to revive Dead_Luna
I think the GERWALK makes the most sense for space combat.
uh.. .huh
DocSane: then...design a plane with multiple thrusters for quick evasie action, and stick some guns on it. not exactly easy, but still easier than building a functional, easily piloted human robot that flies like the dude from Garzey's Wing
en French
You get your main engines that can swing 180 degrees and the mobility and turn speed of a robot suit
ponibas: Thanks B)
they pretty much have engines that can do that now
I like the fighters from Babylon 5. Very practical
RAWRity: But they don't fly like that!
as you wish, Pimp_Puppy_Luna
00,10the legs are the promary thrust nozzles however the ship is covered in micro RCS ports for manuvering.
... wait
00,10note how the controllserfaces dont move when in space.
RAWRity: I told you, the main thrust in battroid mode is from the back pack thrusters
00,10yay some one remebers the awsome designs of B5
umm, Canaria!
Battroids aren't designed for high speed. They're for spinning quickly and tracking a fast-moving target with a Vulcan gun.
and missiles!
00,10Paunch
00,10big fan> cant reconise her due to glasses and hat.
no kiddin
Sumica: she's secretly Clark Kent's daughter
DocSane: Also for the ability to quickly switch out weapons based on a Humanoid configuration. Thus, a huge assault rifle can be switched for an energy blade or a eally really big RPG.
rifle
00,10loud jets for being in space, on the other side of glass
fromt he VF-25S
Kencolt: I have to imagine there'd be a more efficient, simple way to switch weapons that DOESN'T involve having to build a giant, funtional, dexterous hand.
/me highly recommends this OST to anyone who likes the music

Three more days left to my eternal freedom!
Ok, gotta go everypony.......lots of work to do
I came back at a great time.

Cya, Dark92Enigma. Take care. :)
WHAT TECHO MUSIC IS THIS?!?!
YES THIS!
no really what?
Malavolent eternal freedom from?
ponibas: School of course. :)
Mutterguy: so it took us decades to figure out how to do that. How long to make a working robotic version of the human hand on a massive scale capable of surviving travel in and out of space, not to mention space warfare?
so what song is this?!?1
duno
anyone know?
i really what to know
Malavolent *life spoiler* you're never really done...

RAWRity, it's a matter of engineering. the greek could have had the steam engine if they had the desire to do it
Malavolent and once you're out, you're always trying to get back in

how do i widen it?
AVATAR?!?!
AVATAR!!!

Good night everyone

RAWRity oh it's definately not practical.
The Legend of Korra
An thus, that city-ships superiors had the loosest military budget ever heard of, a lot of bored engineers, and a LOT of brave/stupid test pilots looking for a challenge/suicide machine.
vaguely humanoid robots make sense ONLY under one set of circumstances - if you MUST have a human pilot, and can use a direct neural interface, it makes pilot training easier.
is this brony state or nick
what?
hen3ry: wasn't there a Gundam series with something like that?
00,10why not zoidberg?
umm, yes?
i have to go everypony bye bye
RAWRity: possibly, I never watched much Gundam
I mena a tank or a airplane is far more practical and easy to maintain, but i suspect the rule of cool will come into play.
I vaguely remember seeing a Gundam series on Toonami back when it was on 5 days a week, where the guy piloting it dislocated his shoulder, and the same thing happened to his robot.
RAWRity: That would be Mobile Fighter G-Gundam. Which tossed common sense out the window-- it was basically Street Fighter with mecha.
/me is back (gone 00:15:21)
Except more so.

Why is Toph so awesome?
Ninjazz: because she's Toph Mother Fucking Bei Fong
00,10cause she gave up points in sight to put more in badass
one of greatest water benders, one of greatest earth benders, and greatest (albeit by default) airbender. And also Zoidb... er... whats-his-face.
lol
XD
Sumica: I lol'd.

Toph isn't actually blind. She's just physically incapable of seeing anything less awesome than herself.
... ouch
that's democracy right there
Then that leaves... can she even look at mirrors?

RAWRity: all governments are flawed by the fact that humans end up running them
you konw what they ay.. if you hav eto ask
Turns out there just isn't ANY kind of government that works in this world. Maybe try anarchy next?
hen3ry, we should let the ponies do it
yes. Ponycracy is only way
As if it's gonna still be there.
Of course.
Ponycracy or Equinarchy?
RAWRity: I'm pretty content on our system here in Sweden
Oh yeah, that incredibly phallic drill

00,10king fool, topsy tervy day
Black hole sun, won't you come.
RAWRity: Because... it's simply not done.
RAWRity: cuz he enjoyed using the Earth King as a puppet too much?
http://puu.sh/DXQJ
Nooooope
because as soon as manage to complete the coup, another pops up against your one

Mutterguy: but he has the Dai Li, the strongest earthbenders in the city.

YOU DO NOT SPLIT THE PARTY.

RAWRity, XD
hey Phase4
and then Sokka had to decide: See his dad, or get some o' dat ass
orly?
Ohai Phase4 :P
RAWRity, each avatar is a new user, if you get killed as root it takes init with it and the kernel panics XD
NOODLE OUR
*HOUR
Phase4: and energy bending is deleting a user
WHAA?!
CUT AJ!?
ARE YOU BUCKING KIDDING ME?!?!?!
up next spongebob!
cant he just crawl out?
00,10he'lll take a meat bun.........and eat it.
And yes
AJ BEST PONY!
CONFIRMED once more <3
MMMM THAT'S GOOD MEAT BUN
00,10indeed Vordox
rape
IMPOSSIBRU
RAWRity, the avatar removes bending by removing someone from the 'bending' group, which owns /dev/bending
OH NO
brainwashed
Phase4: so what would bloodbending be?
It's a TRAP
Linux x Avartar fanfic is go!
RAWRity, ssh access?
Why cut AJ... :(
or perhaps a setuid binary
Vordox: time/unnesecary to the script as a whole
./dev/bending/water/bloodbending
It was NOT unneccesary
What the heck? :S
Her fessing up would be a GOOD morale for children
Hey there, Polydunami!
Even if NOT under eyes from their parents or superiors in a way
hey Polydunami!
no spongebob GOD WHY!
They should feel guilt and confess.
Hey there Ninjazz and MahBoi777! :3
If anything, that' a VERY important lesson
Just watched the Rainbow Factory PMV, and I must say, the music is awesome
Sumica: Which video is this I remember this song from somewhere
Vordox: but not the lesson the episode was going for, and thus not necessary to the script when they were already stretched for time.
00,10Equestiran time
RAWRity: :'(
Vordox: A moral that is already covered by the bakers fessing up to their crimes.
Celestia is best pony :3
I can understand being upset about your fav character being cut out, but sometimes that happens when you have such a limited runtime.
So yeah, it is technically unnecessary.
No Freakin' Way!
lol
yay Spike Bravo :)
lolwut?!
XD
00,10last ep of book 2 time
do tha monkey!
HEART!
Hell, at least it was better than the rather cramped pacing of the Korra finale, which I honestly think should have been at least 3 parts.
so much nostalgia
Well, rushed and kind of cut the legs out from under the whole threat they were fighting.
00,10yeah RAWRity, I think part of it was they were unsure of a seasion two at the time of making it
Sumica: I understand that, but there's kind of the issue of the show's pacing up to that point. It had been rather casual as far as build up for the first 10 eps.
then BAM SHOVE AMON'S BACKSTORY IN AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.
00,10yup
Oh no no
Gotta get this here exposition out of the way so we can show those planes again.
When they made the series, they originally only WANTED 12 episodes.
The intention was a mini-series.
And then "Hey! Remember all those benders who lost their powers forever and ever? Never mind that."
so I heard Avatar was being mixed with GNU/Linux?
00,10but i would rather they had closure then have it be forever left open if they did't get more eps
So it's really only fair to judge this season as if it were a complete mini-series since that was their goal for it originally anyways (thus the wrapped up happy ending with everything resolved)
Sumica: I agree with you there, but I think if they were working under the idea that they only had the one season, then they needed to cut some of the fat from the first 10 eps to establish what's important.
errrr
00,10defentaly
for instance: the Wolf-bats were basically pointless to the story as a whole, as was Pro-bending in general.
CRAP
http://i.imgur.com/vl1Tl.jpg
00,10defentaly
...
00,10probending served only to introduce the brothers
Honestly, the pro-bending thing would have made for an interesting background thing, but we got 3 episodes dedicated entirely to the thing.
and that honestly wasn't necessary.
i really liked the pro-bending
as a world detail
00,10oh it was good.
It's certainly a neat idea
oh crap its ghandi
what do youmean you people?!
He's old, then
and I liked it.
I liked it, alot, but it didn't do that much for developing the story
00,10but from a limited story point her joining it was all they realy needed.
I still haven't watched the finale ;-;
'cuz that was a hundred years ago
but it had no real effect on the story otuside of introducing Mako and Bolin
it was nyquil
no go to sleep
00,10it's uncle
....
OK. Even I, whoo think raw fish with hot sauce is one of the great dishes of all time, got nauseated by that.
ONE MORE THING
RAWRity, no real effect on the plot, thats true
orly?
....
challenge accepted
>can't bend metal
huzzah! i finally connected on my mobile!
As Pinkie would say
"Give her time...."
forshadowing
RAWRity, but it did give kora drive, a reason to get off the island and more reason to fight amon, or at least make the effects more immediate
Morning erverypony...
00,10hey it's the wizard from D3
not a cou'
Stay awhile and listen!
ALL the chakras
/me is happy :)
03oh yay
03PC version of Jammit
sagas: Why so happy?
no
00,10good anoligy for kids
Phase4: sure, but that could have been accomplished simply by having her want to see Mako again, rather than an entire 1/4 of the show being dedicated to it.
oh god he just flooded so many frog homes
Ponies47, i was finally able to connect on my mobile
sagas: Nice
RAWRity, fair enough
Morning
Good morning FairysHuff!
:3
good morning
RAWRity, i think the real problem is how damned short the season is
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6584kdk011rxy1wdo1_500.jpg
....that was easy
Polydunami: hi
00,10time constrantes
pleasure
pleasure....
RAWRity: Oh, that's perfect.
Hey there FairysHuff
So true RAWRity
About time.
if you catch my drift
Om hallo
Phase4: true, 12 eps isn't much to work with if you want to build a big story, but I've seen shows do it before. And in that case, you have to prioritize what you're going to put into the series.
Now throw that iPod touch into 80% concentrated HCL
>these things happen
i missed tea time with my mom
what happened
00,10indeed RAWRity, i was very much wahhuh how at that moment.
03XD
03HCL>?
...
^ Sumica
Really, I love Korra so far, despite the issues with the season finale, but that finale definitely shows that the creators had a LOT of ideas that they fell in love with, but didn't ever get down to cutting out what wasn't necessary for the plot.
dat joke sense...
HydroChloric (acid)
what?
bad dream
hopefully they get a propper 26 ep season
03ah
00,10honistly I was hopeing Korra was gonna be like avatar. 20 eps per seasion
03HCl, noob
/me hides
How nice. ^_^
that would have worked well
Zuko and Iro are such a great pair.
Hey there, Phase4!
and given how much they had to do, there's no real side stories like in airbender
These chakras are really easy to unlock
>_>
ohai Ninjazz
People should learn to kickstarters....
00,10aang is realy in touch with his spirt side........or the guru is dat good.
Nuu
Because
HCL is HML
with a C
aang IS spiritual
though to be fair, in airbender they were traviling across the world and just happened across many things, kora happens within the confines of one city
So it is HyperChloricLugia! :D
Korra is Physical
I smell of pool o-o
Dat double double cross
00,10Xanatos gambit
03uh
03well the element is Cl
wait.. Gambit??
I know
Why does everyone who teaches Aang a SPIRITUAL lession apparently at least partly bats?
I even thought I saw a typo in one of my science tests
referring HCl as HCL
so I laughed
grief triangle
.v.
because it's spiritual and therefore batty?
Is somepony talking about Gargoyles? :3
00,10could be worse he could be runing after childern who burst in to flames when he reachesthem
God, these chakras. >_>
Korra was different. It was paced more like an Anime mini-series, with each episode more or less building on the events of the last, so that the finale is less a culmonation of past events, and more the conclusion of a linear story.
I'm inspired to watch that, actually. Gargoyles.
ello all :)
... I'll be back. Getting some DINNER.
hello Irish Pony
which is why, despite its issues, I think Korra was a game changer, much like Avatar was before it.
Irish_Pony: Hello you
*Very depressed and needy fairy snuggles up to chat* ~_~

OMG!
WTF! BBQ!
wait, that was real
dat run
Phase4: Thankyou
kind of? Kind of?
BOOM
and then everything goes to hell because Katara's all prejudiced
Oh no.
only one anchor
RAWRity, i'm fine with that though, it works well for the material. like with the first season of mlp where the end goal was the gala, and throughout the season there are refferences to it
She has reason to be prejudiced against Zuko.
wait.. Kitara??
theres not much *real* continuity and you can pick it up anywhere, but those who pay attention get a deeper experience
Colours? I used italics.

sorry
CriticKitten: that's...not how it works.
ah. so absolutely no formatting, WHATsoever?
halo all
RAWRity: Uh, apparently it is, since that clearly works for the other chakras.
when did he pretend?
He's most definitely still afraid of things after this point, for example.
>_>
My friends are being tortured in a city in the clouds!
CriticKitten: it's not about dispelling all fear. it's about learning to not let it control you.
hahahha
Toph canoon
Go, blind bad ass girl!
Thus, letting go of Katara wouldn't mean to stop caring about her. It would be about putting his role as the avatar ahead of her.
earth surfing

Funfact: we never see those guys get out of there. They could very likely be dead.

That's...silly.

FLY HACKER. >:o

hey whos the black filly?
Hello RareP0N3
that pony is a spy
I know that much
00,10Nyx, Irish_Pony
Sumica: who?
ZERG
Oh right, the Extended Cut DLC went in. Wonder how bad it messes things up.
Nyx is such a mary-sue
and shouldn't be praised
:D
poor guy
This is.... interesting
that blue guy is an expert troll
NOOOOOOOOO
00,10Nyx is more or less Filly nightmare moon.
lmao
is it me or does buzz soudn like adam west?
XD
lol
nothing canon from an overrated fanfic
cool
BRAINS
what does cannon mean
MahBoi777: brains
lol what the fuck?
Even so, Kencolt, some people's opinions on Disney is "that kiddy company". And the movies they produce can pretty much scare kids at times :D
destroy uuuuuu
00,10as it it's part of the offical story flutterchu
Fact from the universe of a media
his space ship looks more like a doom map than an actual ship. :)
This is odd
Say what you will, Zurg does get some pretty clever lines.
Welcome to die
HELO X-MEN WECOM TO DIE
lolwut
green guys. :D
Zurg's voice sounds familiar
Sumica: I have no idea what youre talking about
those robots have the aim of Stormtroopers :P
zargggg
MahBoi777, if that feeling comes up you check IMdb
HOLY FUCK HIS MOUTH MUST BE HUGE
HOLY SHIT
Irish_Pony: or battel drodis
and then you link us with your discovery of the century if there's one
00,10as an example Twi being taught by celestia is Canon.
Ok zurgs voice is pissing me off D:

toy story cartoon?
Luna having a student herself is not
Why did you tell them D:
Alchemist: Yeah, a low budget one. lol
helo TheComputerNerd i her u like fallout 3
Okay. WHY do these types TELL the hero that a self destruct has been initiated so they know it's time to escape?
Sumica: you mean canadian
Yeah
00,10no canon
Is this the movie that started the sereis, or is it said series?
scttish-geeky is moriarity
lol
oh yeah and don't click on the ads either, oblivous virus. :D
TheRareP0N3: no i am not
all of a sudden grim
Sumica: what does canon meen?
3I chose Nyx to be the wondering pony for today because she looks cute to me
scottish-geeky: ADMIT IT!
o-o
3and just look at her on her little cloud :3
00,10I just told you
Eddmario: Well, kind of both-- it was both the movie and the three first episodes.
@SlurryMoon Nyx is best pony
uh, he face is blue...
Colin Moriarty at your service
WOAH
xD
FUCK
awwwwww
Take Bambi for example: people who have never seen that movie are all, "Bambi? You mean that movie with the innocent kid deer who loses her mother?
Midnight or Nyx ?
I heard the word *bambi* in call of duty. :)
Whoops, forgot to close that quote :S
TheRareP0N3: i am not him he a dick
scottish-geeky: he resembles you than. :)
:D
Colin Moriarty is an asshole
gob is the beast
^
And my first rebuttal to that statement is Bambi is a freaking MALE deer. A STAG.
If you ever read the actual book-- which can be tricky to find-- it's less like a cartoon and more like Animal PLanet.
CrimsonPhoenix: his VA is Wayne Knight, he was Al in Toy Story 2
Also, he grows up :3
i don't really understand this show.
lol
o_O
lol@ right click
TheRareP0N3: how iz it cus im scottish and hes Irish

TheRareP0N3: SHe's an ALIEN. And this species comes in blue.
3There's actually two versions to this pilot. This is the "TV version" which uses the same voice actor as the rest of the series. There's also a "movie version" that has Tim Allen voice Buzz. I personally like Tim Allen's version of the show better.
You gotta have blue skin :3
OH MY GOD

That girl you totally remember from the other YuGiOh seasons
(///_-) this... isn't yu-gi-oh
WHOA CURSE WORDS?
SlurryMoon: do you know why? :s
Biglaw: its japan
Biglaw: WRONG. This is Yu-Gi-Oh. The other show is the fake.

This is the series based on the original manga, in which Yami was an evil badass >_>
彼らは、私はこれが子供だと思った遊戯王の悪い言葉が示す言う
mishia, they hate them here too, but meh
suddenly japanese
The one released in the States is PC trash by compairson
we have less of them
*comparison
flutterchu: stop beeeing awesome
:3
sounds like more of a girl than an actual girl
and i think thats real japanese
Magicbox with no explanation
google translate chokes on it
なぜ遊戯王は女の子によって表明されてい
ABOSULTULY NOTHING BAD WILL RESULT FROM THIS
ABOSULTLY NOTHING
Except for name changes-- and a lot wren't-- Yu-Gi-Oh's US localisation is pretty close to the original. Season 0 never showed here mostly because, well, it didn't fly well in Japan either-- it really wasn't until the card games started that people started liking it. And now it enver ends.
ok, chill with the gratutionous japanese FlareChaser
Dken2021: tab fial
tab fail Dken2021?
SlurryMoon: are we going to watch season 1?
o-o
The music sounds interesting
oh my, didn't notice -_-
flutterchu, my client doesn't accept you font
3not anytime soon unless another mod shows it tomorrow
wish granting box
omg dat wink
what
00,10Know I have told you before flutterchu
Kencolt: Er, no, the US localization is similar to the card-game focused version of the show, which came after this one. But it's not at all similar to the original series. >.>
this sounds familar....
FGHHH
i cant wach this
what? girls expressed by? stupid google translate
sooo i try my hand at drawing, after a long time of not doing even a stick man, how do i did ? http://i46.tinypic.com/2q06reo.png
Sumica: im not sending links
tristan is awesome
noo
ummm dat foreshadowing?
gold
no, keep chat in English
00,10No you are doing somthing else I have told you to stop doing before.
SOOS
Sumica: what?
CriticKitten: That is, in fact, what I said. This was based on the earlier episodes of the manga, and again-- it's didn't fly so well in Japan. The show really only got popular there when the Cards started-- and the US never bothered with this part.
thegreatandpowerful: Nicework, but apprently they fully removed links in public chat
do it in private chat
or pm
flutterchu I think it's the japanese
The Public Moral guys? Is that real?
nope
damn
Dken2021: when did he argue about that
that would be so badass if they were :P
that is one badass bodyguard
How is a four year old going to be a main leading character?
0.o
.___.
what the crap is gonig on
mishia the same reason they are destined in saving the world
grandpa is a pervet is dis one
ah right
3Pervy old fart x3
Kencolt: That's because they turned the card game into a marketing tactic. It's not that the market for such shows didn't exist....Death Note, for example. :p
Show logic :3
.......
holy shit
suddenly bodyguard
lol gramps is beter in jap
At least you can tell yuugi likes the girl like a sister
what the
Somthing i can belive :3
Way to encourage and support grandad.
I wonder if that is his natural hair color
Kencolt: But cards are much easier to sell to kids (which are a larger market), thus....
"student life will be rose coloured"?
08,01Iron_Edge: !!
sondly time travil
Egyptian history KWEIIIEEE
ill be right back
Om: Course it is.
:3
Nyx thinks it's safe.
08,01Iron_Edge: ooooOOOOOoo
So it must be safe.
.-. that is certianly omnious
Ninjazz: I dunno, I think the grandpa dies his hair grey
0.0
his hari looks messy
MIIIIIIND CRUSH!
CriticKitten: Perhaps-- but the original mangaka was the one who chifted the manga towards the cards and Egyptian stuff... The actual card game, was really an afterthought when the second arc (the first card arc) proved to be insanely popular.
Mutterguy: lolz
Oh he wastes years? that is very belivable
8 years? but he looks 8
Om: Grand parents cannot be grandparents without atleast one parent having grey hair.
Mutterguy: scure the rules i have munny
08,01scottish-geeky: OHAI!
08,01scottish-geeky: you're scottish!
wait
Kencolt: That's how marketing works.
the opening spoiled it
so much
Ninjazz: And yet he looks so youthful. It must be coloured
CriticKitten: In fact, the manga/anime rules are preposterous-- the "real" card game is very compl;ex.
scottish-geeky I thikn at this point it's actually green hair
.____________________.
08,01scottish-geeky: where in scotland?
I just came back, and we are watching childrens card games on motorcycles?
iron...
Mutterguy: oki ya
Om: He obviously have a lot of passion in his work.
Kencolt: Pft, clearly you've never played Magic
RyunosukeKnT no, but there will be some good old fashioned violence
iron O_O
Ninjazz: Obviously.
right on cue
8 years older and still cwuieee

08,01Iron_Edge: heeeeeeeeeeeehehehehehe <3
mishia: Are you reffering to me? Or to a trace element in your blood stream that aids in immune system function?
CriticKitten: PLayed it when it first was released. Still have my orioginal deck somewhere. Duel Monsters has entirely different tactics.
np to yu iron_edge
Vordox: i never had a iq
im to lazy to wright the whole name :3
I do remember Little kuirboj mentioning it was violent
Kencolt: Eh, so do a lot of card games but the gist is identical
08,01Iron_Edge: thought technically, you shouldn't be posting that in here; may have been better to do it as a pm
20,000 yen=200$?
Kencolt: Build up an army, kill the other guy's army
*kuriboh
08,01Iron_Edge: but yeah, i really like it!
OH THAT DEFINTALY DOESNT MEAN YOU HAVE TO FIGHT THE BULLIES :3
CriticKitten: No... tey really are quite different in execution.
YATTA
lol.

I read the rules
no demon powers for you
lolz
08,01Iron_Edge: aye
what?
3flutterchu, just be sure to keep it in English.
3that's all
Oh my noooo D:
*sigh*fine
if only the cartoons were in english...
Kencolt: You'll have to define "execution". 'cuz I've played several of those card games and the basic core concept is pretty darn similar.
/me 08,01ruffles flutterchu's hair
D: AHHHH
08,01you little scamp

Never forget your towel.

;( so pretty
Irish_Pony: soooooo
And then they both died

scottish-geeky: so?
way too bad for a first try? opinions? http://i46.tinypic.com/2q06reo.png
D: nooooo! that is horrible!
That laugh, was terible
Kencolt: You mean none of the card games we were just talking about? :P
08,01my momma so indian, she drove 5 miles before realising you can't take an elephant on a dual-carriageway
D:
yami time
Irish_Pony: idk the jap ver of yugio look like i came out three yers befor the one in amrica
And Duel MOnsters plays NOTHING Magic the Gathering. PLayed both. Trust me.
what does his puberty voice sound
OMG
And then
fucking magic
MURICA!
scottish-geeky: Heh
that yami vocie
Irish_Pony: eyyup
Kencolt: So have I. The core concept is literally identical.
Oh crap. OH CRAP.
08,01TheGreatAndPowerfulT: that's awesome
/me 08,01wishes he could draw
is it time to duel?
i love this music
GAME TIEM
its time to d-d--d--d-d-d-d-d-d-
CriticKitten: I... see. I cannot agree, mind you. Mechanics, concept, and execution-- but you're welcome to hold that opinion.
and thus yu-gi unlocked the power of leather pants
08,01i also wish my dog wouldn't kip down outside my room and FART. ALL. NIGHT.
da crap this isent dual monsters
Kencolt: The specific rules are obviously different but the core concept of the game is the same. You both start with a pool of points, build up armies and proceed to trade jabs to reduce each other's pool of points.
08,01bloody hell, it's absolutely disgusting
08,01freakin' reeks, mon
no
that is definiantly a female voice
Phase4 spoilers: it's the leather shoes

mishia: no more
D:

i thought we were watching 2 eps?
NO MORE THIS KILLS IT FOR ME
more
00,10this was alot beter before the cardgames
what happened to the blue haired girl?
/me holds the *free hugs* sign out
Incidentally, if you haven't ever read the original Yu-Gi-Oh manga, you really should. It's a good read. I happen to prefer the manga's approach to that particular story, though.
dont roleplay hug please.
3yeah, before the cardgame was announced, this show was totally different
/me 08,01hugs mishia
3I do love the premise of it
Sumica: i had one of the card in m walit but the my walit got put in the washing mashin
lol
so
so slurry this was going to be an awesome show?
the title "king of games" makes more sense here than the other show
when do the duels start?
:P
and then
08,01Shamroc: do you accpept mastercard?
the card game happened?
Sumica, i recon they could have pulled this off and had cardgames
ehy dos he have green hair
I gun... FINALY!
:(
3I hope you're okay with listening to the opening each time. I love it.
Om: a gun not i gun
Shamroc: do you accept pinkiecred?
Om: we fight with cards round these parts
moar yugioh pls
he doesn't like this opening?
mishia: that we do
00,10well the whold deadly games thing was more intersting then they pulld screw the rules i have money.
08,01Shamroc: balls, i'm out of change. can i pay you in goats?
scottish-geeky: Meh, me not haf tah spelins
sooooo
Shamroc http://i46.tinypic.com/2q06reo.png what do you think ? also thinking about doing AJ or twi next wich one ?
In the manga, he's forced to play a game in which he places a large stack of money on his open palm, and given a knife. He has to stab the pile of money to retrieve the money, and can keep as much of the money as he is able to stab through successfully. :3
Om: i have no idea what u just siad
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: better than anything i've eva done
Sumica: I wasnt aware the show ever followed any rules
scottish-geeky: That was the point.
Om: oki
Yumi is creepy, and gives a good reason to him being a fighter instead of the normal kind hearted yuugi
(so naturally, being a total nutcase as I am, I prefer the manga one....but creativity points for that last episode, it's pretty cool)
Night all
good night Irish_Pony
kid if u esnt frends becom a borny
Oooo!
Bronies are all friends
I know which one this is!
I might get the manga if I get some money
and hold our hands in harmony
CriticKitten, wow, dats a heck of a stab game
Isn't that right, fellows?
ded
I *love* the game he plays in this episode.
08,01Shamroc: is that where the other inmates force me to "hug the salad"?
tetsu the hedgehog?
Which should tell you all that it's a sadistic game. :3
mishia: i have no freinds all i have are ponies and pokemon
Basically... the previous games were to establish the "game" theme and the Friendship theme the mangaka wanted to set before he started the real story. You'll see similar in Bleach, where it's a bunch of random hollows before serious story arcs start.
well shit, can't talk about what I've been doing the past 45 minutes
tetsu the hedgehog
Yugioh season 0?
/me sigh
flutterchu, you have the bronies
3I never understood why Yugi wears a collar. x3
we will give you hapiness :D
It's a pity he didn't keep making up games.
08,01SlurryMoon: because collar
00,10wow the sound is way out of sync. I hear a girl talking but I see yugi on screen
3my it's like symbolism... like he's a slave to his fate
SlurryMoon: For the shippers of course.
slurrymoon ethier a. cause its cute or B. adult bongage joke
tritins name is honda
:3
ladies love the collars
do people still watch this?
08,01big, burly men love the collars too
SlurryMoon: well thats one way of putting it...
Ghost30k quite a few people surprisingly
shhe works thaer
I feel sorry for Yuugi, a slave to his destiny/fate (talent)
SlurryMoon: that's deep
:C
yes
Lol
Sumica, thats not a sync issue

OH WHY THIS ISNT GOING TO EFFECT THE PLOT
OK. I'm an EXPERT in Japanese Cuisine.. and I have NO IDEA what the buck a Stamina Bento is. Um. UNless it's grilled eel, but that would be in high summer.

scottish-geeky: an emotion i made up myself -_-

flutterchu: oki
3I don't know Phase
THis is common, in "junior high" you can't have a part time job, but often in "High" you can. Why, I never figured out.
dat crush
....Yugi has a thing for costumes.
Phase4: they also have to go to on saturdays
I guess it prevents them from not doing their studies
dat fetish
....that's natural I suppose.

He's right. I can't stand catsup on my burgers.
