Cata made things easier, Buytoast -- but it still was a cookie cutter thing. I REALLY like what they did for MoP-- the nwe Talents are useful, but not given to (yet) a "YOU NOOB" if you haven't hit a theorycrafter.
sweetie-bot/10
Kencolt: Not to mention. Less CC
yeah, the talents for mists are interesting
i was pretty dissappointed seeing them dumb down the talent system for cata

...is Higurashi any good Polydunami? I keep hearing contrasting opinions
*it's
11,02Lyra`: Oooooo
Well, I like it, but you'd have to develop your own opinion on it, MadSurge
One thing, however; try the visual novel.
Polydunami: why? does it come before the anime?
No, the anime is based off the novel
11,02Personal Second Perspective...also known as the PSP :)
:D
Same story and everything
Oh, excuse me. I meant visual NOVELS.
There are eight of them in total.

Lil_B: he just spoiled his daughter :D
So Wait...
What Would Diamond Tiara's Cutie mark Represent...? Being A Beotch?
spoiled probably
her profession: daughter
lol
Laurayne: yeah, being a spoiled brat
her talent Is being A Spoiled Rich Betch?
I mean a diamond tiara doesn't serve any purpose besides to show it off and be flashy

Oh Oh! Question!
What Did people Used To Call granny Smith When She Was Young? xD Filly Smith? :P
Hey i have a question who did the voice of granny smith again i forgot?
Morning everybrony.
ElloEllo
hai Malavolent
Granny Smith is a type of apple, but that is a good point
hallo Malavolent
Maybe it's a title for the senior of the family.
but who did the voice though?
most think Annie Smith
I Know Theyre An Apple. But You Wont Go Callin A Young Filly "Granny" Would You? xD
LOL! I just saw a Micky Mouse Cardboard Cutout in a Shop in a Scene of a Movie made in 1931... I don't know why but I think that's amazing
when they built the whole town with the help of the zap apple jam, why does sweet apple acres actually depend on the anual cider selling?
Invi contracts
Granny Smith: Trolling The Ponyville History Books Since It Was Founded :)
heh
the cider sales get them through winter
I am assuming there are property taxes and such to pay
Laurayne: more like trolling Diamond Tiara before she was even born :D
Hahaha MadSurge
DeadpoolDash, sounds like a trollestia tale

hi Vivix
Yoyo
I don't like burgers... I prefer eating burger patties with cheese slices on top of them :)
Hmm, I suddenly have the urge to go make a burger then deep fry it for some reason
hello mates. God WHAT have I been eating!?
/me licks TheRandomkid321

Back to Planetside 2 I goooooo~
Well... 5:16 AM. It'

Hmm, anyone want a beta key? I think I just got one earlier...
AdamTheDuck You wouldn't do that if you knew what happened minutes before this.
I think I'll finish the fic Im reading and call it a night! :)
Am I the only one who has been to a birthday partie and the gift you got them was also another persons gift?
TheRandomkid321: maybe as a kid? I don't remember

SO... anyone wanna play minecraft with me?

'Morning' Eli
Good morning ELi
how've you been Eli
Im think what to get for dinner first..
alexxm: since yesterday? sleeping
Hello alexxm and Eli :$
yo MadSurge
hi Vivix LightTrooper105 and alexxm
nothing up here?
how've you been MadSurge
nothing much for now
welp. TF2 it is then :P
I once had a book review in the paper.
alexxm: droopy? :D
TheRandomkid321: you mean your book was reviewd in the paper?
Eli no my book review was in the paper.
TheRandomkid321: not bad. congrats
2,14 alright, let's hope I can get this working
2,14 if I manage to, you will (hopefully) be in for a pleasant stream
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMUx01Yl-mE dafuq?
Does anyone get annoyed with my constant requests for people to play minecraft? They're just requests. Nothing more.
oh, sry
:O ValTheJean stream!

nighty taoumi

Goodnight taoumi
/me hugs night
OOh stream
ooh stream, thanks Val
2,14 don't thank me just yet, I'm just hoping what I have prepared works out
DaringDerpy: ... why did i even click that...
DaringDerpy: i think that counts towards sexual content
Am I the only one who sees celestia as kind of a tryant?
this is beyond sexual content
TheRandomkid321: yes.
2,14 daringderpy: I really hope what you posted wasn't
Eli do you want me to explain why I see celestia as a tryant?
From totally unsupported fanon?
sure do it TheRandomkid321
It may take up alot of space int he main chat though
TheRandomkid321: if it's because she doesnt allow democracie and ruled for thousands of years...
well she's still a gentle monarch. nota tyrant
Eli well thos eare a couple of points.
i hear a PS1..
Those points are totally invalid due to her governing style though
or is ps2
I don't mean a tryant just... I don't know the word.
Dictator?
LightTrooper105: ps2 i think
yeah PS2
oh i haven't seen the old ps2 opening in age
Vivix Eh.
Anyway..
LightTrooper105: know your system starts man
Vivix: nope. she was born into the position
Spectrum_Rush I did its been long since I last hear it
Vivix: she didn't achieve it with military power
Well, we think she was. She and luna took controll some time after the original kingdom fell- according to hearths warming eve
True, but a dictator don't have to-
Dat shadow of the Collosus
^
but she can't be since she probably has a government under her to take some of the workload off
that and Luna
Blueblood probably has some governing power as well-
Vivix: that's why the mayor exist
Yeah
So, yeah, I don't see how she could be anything like a Tyrant
Even in old kingdoms the king had vassals to take care of the single towns/ counties
the mayor doesn't proove anything. kings always had dukes to watcho over tehir lands. still. celestia is no tyrant or dictator
oh god Blueblood with governing power
Well, no, it might indicate or hint at a possible government, btu she probably has all power if it comes to it
Spectrum_Rush: like the Earl of Lemon, he lives in a castle alone :D
Dat kick .-.
Blueblood might have the same power as a Mayor
hm...
MadSurge: That Is Acceptable!
Vivix: yeah :D
what is this?
but the people love her. if she wouldn't stick to her own rules, she wouls have been kicked ages ago. alicorn or not
DaringDerpy: wait for it...
2,14 your youtube link
2,14 don't post things like that again
yes yes
Yeah, Luna and Celestia do really well as a governing power
won't happen again
even if we don't get to see all the things they actually do
Vivix: because everyone likes seeing bureaucratic stuff done, amirite
Hehe, MadSurge you are riight
dungeon crawler game?
what are we watching?
DaringDerpy: have you never heard of Shadow of the Colossus? :O
no
never
me neither
^
I have, but only briefly
is this...
yes, i think it is
DaringDerpy: boss game, you go around the world searching for colossi to kill
yes it is
And they're HUUUUUUGE
i must play this
actually have a copy but its ntsc and my ps2 is pal
hmhm
REALLY anoyed me when it got here and would not work
Stupid regional locks
Mega_Milk: Have you donemy OC yet :D
2,14 Little fun fact: The language spoken in this game was a derivative created from both Latin and Japanese
Mega_Milk: Have you donemy OC yet :D
Overthinking cartoons for children ahoy
MadSurge Yep that's me.
Caramel: in Nier there was a village that spoke japanese with the hiragana characters shuffled around
I disagree with that TRK
^
Nature is seen as unatural- it's just the way in Equestria, it might actually BE unatural, we don't know
Vivix you state a fair point.
As for the sun and moon, apparently this has always been done, before Luna and Celestia took controll, the unicorn kingdom did it themselves,
if this was because chaos existed before, or not- we don't really know
what lagauge is this
As for the racism, we mostly establish that to represent a flock-animal, such as a horse's, natural suspicious to anything unknown
Vivix: the Evertree forest looks like the equivalent of a "living" haunted house :D
i have the thought that weather manipulation is a way to control various wild beasts, such as wendigoes in Hearths Warming Eve
a safety precaution if you will
Could be, most likely it is because, for some reason, in Equestria, and their world, weather does not change withou the aid of magic
Could be-
Vivix OBJECTION!
Vivix: or manual shuffling of the clouds
It could also just be because it's more efficient, but RD says..The weather changes on its own, as if it was really unatural- so it probably c an't change on its own?
Hm, yeah
the other problem isnt just the everfree
what about the weather around appeloosa?
Did we get to know anything about it?
like in the desert
It is stated on an episode that the weather changes by itself in the everfree forest. Ponys fear this place for seemingly no real reason. Sre a few dangerous beasts but that's probably why it's different. There are different kinds of beasts there so the ponys ar afraid of it for no reason other than it's different. So they leave it alone.
i am pretty sure the buffalo do NOT have weather manipulation techniques, though i COULD be wrong
Yeah, they fear the nature of it because it is different. But they fear the beasts because they're dangerous
the meat I bought has so much water in it that it more cooks than fries in the pan...bastards...
They describe it as unatural.. in a way that implies that it is really unique, considering it is hte original home of the royal sisters make this really interesting
Ryunosuke, yeah- the weather there might be left to drift, but it is implied that it can't- but that might just be RD's way of speaking
Vivix do you not think that the beasts did not once roam the ponyville areas? The reason they never settled in the forest is probably (like humanity) it got weaker and weaker.
The beasts may have, the everfree may have..receeded, but I don't think so
Honestly, the only knowledge we have on everfree history iss...tidbits from episodes
but it don't seem to have changed since Granny Smith was young
Of course, how long that exactly is, we don't know, but one generation is usually enouh to a change in forests
Vivix because it was never explored or anything probably.
Nono, the royal sisters lived there
in a fully built castle
don't make it angry
bad idea
whether or not it was the Everfree then, or if they created Everfree on purpose, or by accident, we don't know- but most fanfic authors take it to have ...been created when Nightmare moon was banished
but how long ago THAT was we do not know vivix
it could be 1000 years or 5000 years
chaaaarge!
Most speculate that it is around the time Luna was banished, but --hard to say when they settled there with a castle- but minimum 1000 years
bite its foot off!
ya I agree a minimum of 1000 years
kill the daft wee beastie
Or bottom line, it was just a spooky place for the children to enjoy.
We don't know how long ago..hearths warming eve portrayed, if we did, we could probably guess when, ca, they came into power
It might have been alicorn attempt at creating a self sustainable natural environment- but I don't think it was made as a spooky-fun-place
poor creature :(
its meat will be delicious
next time bring a grenade launcher
ok i'm gonna spell this out: it's a kids show. relax. you put more thought into this stuff than the creators themselfes
Probaly
but that's the FUN part
11,02Night all :)
Saying it's a kid show, don't think about it, is boring- especially if you write or read fanfics
Goodnight NewSuperBronyU|Zzz

inb4 kick/banhammer
ponychan has a whole board dedicated to overanalyzation
And don't spam
original: just don't
original: read the rules
k
Overanalyzation is part of the fun of being a lorenerd- taking mistakes and background ponies at facevalue since 1982
sounds good...
What did this creature ever do to you!?
it looked tasty
the amount of bruises he must have
05mornin
is the daft wee beastie dead yet
Vivix: i don't know... i like analysation, but don't over do it. reminds me too much of school when we had to interpret books in ways the author could have never thought of
Good mornin' Wrek
it leaks
ahoy thar Wrek
hi Wrek
05just finished a nice plate of home made nachos with meat salsa and cheese and all that
for breakfast?
Hai Wrek. Ready for drawring?=3
Eli I know, but for us that's fun, so I just do it
NOOOOOOOOOO!
It makes it fun to create that...background history, timelines, lore--characters based on it, you know?
ded .-.
oh wait its around lunch for ya now right Wrek ?

Once again I ask if anyone want's to play minecraft with me?

None of these creatures seems threatening to anything...

This is...what...the 4th colossus?
2nd?
It's been a while since I last played, so I can't remember how far in this is, but I know it's early.
So do you just go around killing giant bosses throughout the game?
AdamTheDuck Yyyep.
pretty much.
Did the stream drop for anyone else?
TheRandomkid321, nope
Odd...
Still up for me
05time for the daily IV drip of motoroil

May I ask why Val has to kill all these Colossus?
Its so he can save the one he loves
Inb4 lovestory with Wrek and Caramel .
Hehe :$
AdamTheDuck: the only other thing to do in the game is finding fruits and lizards to upgrade your health and grip
ARROW
ON MSTONE
GENIUS
2,14 arrows are just to annoy collosi and get their attention
Oh
Double genious :P
They don't act bright do they...?
Vordox: nope
The whole gameplay is on the giants, eh...
So much focus, so much detail, so much thought of MDA
Vordox: yeah
Vordox: the challenge is finding the way to climb/kill them
Caramel: Looking athis just makes me facepalm what Lords of Shadows tried. :D
Vordox: what did they do?
MadSurge: Failed...
MadSurge: Castlevania Lords of Shadow
Vordox: yeah, figured, but how did they fail?
MadSurge: Check a gameplay out of the frost giant
Yay I found it, http://fav.me/d5c7yvc
hey everyone
Vordox: k. Order of Ecclesia though had a really good giant boss climb though
/me licks AdamTheDuck
I remember finding that image and wondering what lovely game it was from
/me noms RainbowPie
MadSurge: You mean the big centaur thing? Yeah
hey MadSurge
Vordox: yeah, Eligor
MadSurge: hated that bastard... so much
Trying to do that with Level 1 restriction..
<---- Worst Hero ever :P
Vordox: I hated the shadow guy much more :D
No wait..
He's not even a HERO
MadSurge: he was awesome :P
Hey RainbowPie
Vordox: of course, but he was balls hard
MadSurge: Compared to Eligor, not even close :P
Pffft Eligor was strong, but not as annoying
would you all stop saying eligor? you're distracting
srly
i get pings here
Oops :D
is it the flying beast next
Eli: Change name then :P
So how many bosses are there?
16
Vordox: :P my name. can't change.
NewSuperBronyU|Zzz: you cant sleep yet
any live streams going on?
What game is this?
Endless Ammo hax
ah so he going against the Pony Colossus now
RainbowPie, pony_4909, Val is playing Shadow of the Colossus right now.
ooh might come have a look
Thanks.
So really, this game is more of a puzzle game than an action game?
AdamTheDuck: Experience game
What do you mean by experience?
AdamTheDuck: It's a unique Genre by itself, where it's focused merely on experiencing the game
Hmm
Haters gonna hate
SotC?
Yep
Thought so
Evil_Spike: wb! haven't seen you in ages!
/me noms Evil_Spike
so what made the collouses
Lawl Caramel :D

Shake that arse
With study and exams though coming up soon...
Basically, I'll be lucky if I'm not studying on the first episode of Season 3
Ouch
:/
/me checks his schedule

Wow, I've never actually gotten this far

welcome back Lil_B
Lil_B, Shadow of the Colossus
SotC
So what was the difficulty of that? That you had to not be spotted to be able to climb?
OH
It get's difficult to climb some of the Colossi
thanks AdamTheDuck :)
that's one big horse
2,14 more like: "that's one small boy"
or that
finally finished watching "M , a Town searches a Murderer"
I really need to make my IRC background black >.>
who is playing? Caramel?
Caramel: so why are you actually killing these zings?
Lil_B, eeyup
*things
2,14 the Dormin made a deal with me
2,14 kill the collosi, and it brings back the girl
ah
what made the collosi
2,14 that's a spoiler
I'd guess the Developer
and a concept artist
and Programmer
Damnit Val, why did you have to make the colour behind your text be that same shade of grey that is used in that optical illusion where it goes darker or lighter depending on what colour is around it? :$
birrrrd
is that Shadow of th Colossus?
it is
cool
The code in this game is fabulous to EVERY single extent...
<3
quit´e
poke
This boss reminds me of trying to get the red coins on the sandbird in Super Mario Sunshine...lol
PHILOMEENA½
Caramel: No girl is worth this...
Not a single girl...
birdy ded
2,14 I'd say it's closer to Owlousious tbh
Caramel: Oh, then it's fine :P
^^^^^
yeah, it occurs to me that you're actually playing an egoiszc douche in this gamr B)
2,14 cause it's totally not about making the ultimate sacrifice for someone you love
Caramel: Errr.. Going out killing stuff is Ultimate Sacrifice?
actually, i have no idea what its about
2,14 the things are very dangerous
aside from stabbing big things
2,14 and they get progressively more dangerous
Caramel From what I saw they where innocent.
Caramel: They are like Babies ffs! And YOU are watching them!
It's like sticking a fork into a Babies head ffs.
The shadows around him are like "gee, what a moron"
Caramel: yes, but are they evil? what did they do to deserve death?
What is this? Shadow of the Collosus?
yes
2,14 jesus, do you want me to spoil it or are you giong to watch?
How far into the game?
Caramel: I'll be quiet. =<
oh i can guess the story now i think
Lords of the Shadowns of the Lgend of Plagiatism
Still noone up for minecraft? Just wondering.
of the I can't hit the right Letters
to bad I don't own a playstation, thats I game I'd love to play
Hai everypony
Hello DerpyMuffins
Hi DerpyMuffins
hi DerpyMuffins
sup DerpyMuffins
This is not a long game guys
Caramel can totally kill them all in a few hours
I think the current record is like an hour and 20 minutes...(runs off to Speed Demos Archive)
And from what i've seen it's not to difficult. But I wouldn't know.
1 hour, 34 minutes, 30 seconds is the record
TheRandomkid321: it looks easier because Caramel already knows how to kill them :D
I like that horse
PONY
2,14 Arro is a true bro
So what game is this?
2,14 stays with you even though you take him to places with giant murderous building
what's this>
?*
im_texting_my_dog: Shadow of the Colossus
Shadowof the colossus DerpyMuffins and im_texting_my_dog
I knew this game looked familiar
And now the fun begins
It has a sad ending though
2,14 SHUDDAP
finally, lunch is here
First time Caramel?
2,14 no, just don't spoil it
I didnt, just said the mood
DerpyMuffins: well yeah, that's spoiling too
2,14 saying it has a bad ending gives them ideas, just don't do it
>.> Some people don't want anything said
^^^^
It's sad becasue the horse dies and the guy kills himself over the loss of his companion... Nah i'm just bucking around...what if that actually happens though o-o
^ :D
Kicked
DerpyMuffins who?
Nvm
Gotta love that beard
OH SHIT
THERE'S A RAVE TONIGHT
:D
I AM EXCITED
THE BEARD IS CLIMBABLE
A wild party animal appeared.
i partied so hard last night
I thought most of the colossus were friendly?
i don't know if i can go tonight
but i want to
Can't be healthy for that colossi to have all that black stuf inside his head
some get aggressive if you stab them DerpyMuffins ...
just look at how it sprays everywhere when he gets stabbed
Poor collosi :(
He has hands why not use them
They're ugly things, why are they poor?
KILL THEM ALL I SAY
^
MadSurge just because they're ugly they deserve to die?
YES
This is like going out into town, and killing hobos that cannot defend themselves good enough. ;_;
lol
Me: "HAi,I'm here to kill you"
Hobo: "Whuh, hah, why?"
thats what I call acupuncture
Me: "Some girl"
Hobo: "kai...wait wha*ded*"
Vordox: It's ok to kill them. God tells you to
DED
2,14 yeah cause, giant shadow beast building monsters = hobos
:D
They grow well...?
From what they look like in this game, they are..."cute"?
Can someone ping me? I want to test something.
what are we watching?
Like I said, babies.
AdamTheDuck: Ping
Ish, Shadow of the Collosus
You'd think they hide their eak spot better
weak
2,14 the weak spots are only visible when wielding the sword

Fish boss
how many colossi are dead now?
Some die willingly, others eat you
DerpyMuffins: The hero not so much carves the colossi to bits with the swords and provides them with a really agressive accupuncture treatment
So the next colossus if a fish thing?
do you hide your weak spots with armor DerpyMuffins?
how many colossi are dead now?
Horsey!
DerpyMuffins: Hence the need to go for specific points on its body
im_texting_my_dog: his name is Agro :3

Darn, salamander wasn't the one I was hoping for...
Nah, Altair has more style

so much running... you woulda thought you could just swan dive into the arena
sneaking around, parkouring everywhere, then suddenly stabbing the hell out of some poor colossi who was just minding his own business with his hidden blade

Fl00t4hSh41: I know. :D

Chrysalis, ikr!

Link traveling across the country side

Katalenic: Same here.
All those lonely nights with only a fire to keep you warm and the horse for company
It's one of my all time favorites.
to dat pit in the ground
I don't think Link and Epona are entirely platonic, if you know what I mean
well he did make a song just for her...
Oooh, this boss is fun if its who I think it is...

Bronysith, of course she has a great singing voice, it's Ashleigh Ball
hehe
she has a music group for gosh sake

Sumica: we already got skime ponies, I don't think we need a gak pony
whats new
*slime
00,10think about it thought Spectrum_Rush
Nothing much and you flufflepuff :3
same :S
Spectrum_Rush: What do you mean? Slug Box'es oc?
Twi really wants to be a tree.
hey, anyone interested in a Keldeo C-Gear password?
Fl00t4hSh41: no
00,10and just wtf were you doing about it mayor mare?
XD
late every year
Sumica: Given the real hair on the pony toys puring slime on them probably isn't a good idea
My positive speech wasn't enough for you? :|
LOL
Chillax.
and it's all twilight's fault
00,10you suck caramel.
Damnit Caramel, you had ONE JOB
DITZY DOO
eeeuuup
that Caramel
poor derpy
DITZY DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
derpy
Ditzy? Wonder if she
XD
Oh Caramel everytime you do this
00,10time to go get a gender change and move to appleloosa
Dang it
ditzy is derpy
Sumica: You mean AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPLELOOOOSA
Sumica: i find it funny you're the only one who didnt ping caramel
Ditzy? Wonder if she's related to Derpy (wink wink)
alexxm: She's a different color.
Rip headphone users.
Because squeesing a bid like a flute is not animal abuse
MONTAGE
00,10oh look java update
(with winter wrap-up instrumental
Activate OCD powers!
Oooo
XD
00,10still say seting up all those bells woul take longer then just you know doing it one by one
Winter Wrap up
this doesnt make sense why did no one think of this sooner
question
Sumica: ikr?
00,102 weeks later, almost done
why didnt they just do that to clear up the snow
where do they put all of that snow?
the music work in this episode is truly beautiful
But they can use the bell system next year
Since apparently only Fluttershy did it
Here's Ditzy now. She's a pallette swapped Derpy.
spike is such a good worker :) because he has hands
Maybe Dizty Doo is that Derpy with the red mane from earlier in the ep
00,10Ryunosuke, it's molestopias problem now
haha Lil_B :P
00,10much like that ball of parasprites
Lol!
Sumica: planetside2 after wrek awakens from his viking slumber?
Ditzy Doo and Derpy Doo are sisters.
so doctor whoove s was so set on helping he showed up twice
Parasprites are a lie
eeeuuup
00,10I am thinking i might go back to bed my self
it's all a lie to hide the truth
Sumica: I have not left it :P
shes the secritary...
the truth about the unsung...
I know exactly what to say. That thing's hideous.
Those three colors don't work together at all....er, I mean, YAY HAPPY ENDING
Sing her song and become nothing.
Sumica: didja even sleep
00,10some yes
DO U EVEN LIFT?
:I
CriticKitten: It's like the pappal guards uniform
oh spike
00,10and hub failed me again with no pony ad's
partys all night
It doesn't have to be pretty
Maybe the fact that they were late with Winter Wrap Up is why Canterlot and other towns look down on them. Maybe they think that Ponyville is a hick town that can't do things right
wats next
Well Sumica the date has been announced anyway
Sumica: Maybe they think online plugs are enough right now
why u no have pony ads hub
dat pic!
its epic@
00,10dun care I want advertisments

CrimsonPhoenix: it's beautiful
It is
Well we were going to see pumpkins launched from cannons and trebuchets
I mean not only the scene it's trying to show
But too much rain down here this week for them
but the whole technic used, the style
CrimsonPhoenix: and does it say "here lies the ashes of the elements of harmony" on the plate?
Eli, I believe so yes
yup
nothing
Incineration would be better in case of someponies trying to use Black Magic to use them for their own good
or something
Nopony wants a Zombie Pinkie Pie
NOPONY
Stinko|TF2: sounds like it would be a fun zombie
brain party?

PeachStreak|wakingup: the stream is the buffer show. it's gaining popularity rather fast around the internet

Cypresswolf: a shadowolt? they had one 30sec apearence...

I'm told there's extra pony stuff in the box too, but I want to wait to see them myself
Eli and yet the best characters in the show
I <3 Shadowbolts
Dken2021: ...welp. opinions. I know i watch the show for other reasons
i <3 wonderbolts?
I have a Timberwolf being made for me too :3 that's for another day
Timberwolves looked awesome
Dken2021: but yeah, maybe if you're lucky, the anounced reapearence of a vilain in S3 is the shadowbolts
Shadow Bolts need to be made into a canon vilian team
they are on the vilian poster
ive hit a milestone
then again, the shadowbolts were just a figmintation from nightmare moon
:O
Hello Everypony
GTG
wow, that's awesome Cypresswolf, and you even got glowing eyes too
^_^ The eyes actually glow - They GLOW!
Eli, even if joke, that can get you banned. No s3, ever
how are things Malk
well, not until november
Vivix: what?
nooooooooooooo they completely canceled MLP in germany WHYY
good alexxm
Reintroduced as villain in S3, or did I read that wrong?
Rofl
why so long until mlp why!?
Vivix: sorry, i didn't quite catch that rule
Any talk of S3 is bannable, so we keep quiet about it, except airdate I suppose
!cd
Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire, Part 1" airs in 20 days, 23 hours, 29 minutes, 9 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012)
damnit now i know there are crystals in s3
What triggers tom?
Vivix: where's that written down? that rule sounds stupid.
^
damn you tom for spoiling
so 5pm it is
The topic Eli
and we like that rule
The artist's husband hooked up the light up eyes - there'll be a switch to turn them on & off and a space that opens to replace the battery - thats all they could tell me without giving too much away
Eli its the first rule
and Empires :'(
Tom broke the rule too ;__;
tom is finally usefull!
Chrysalis: uh... no?
Fl00t4hSh41: !cd triggers him
Eli, look at IRC topic
"S3 Spoilers are not permitted. Discussion of anything related to S3 will result in a ban"
hmm
!topic
oh well
Some guy got banned for linking to one of the songs from the con
Sjust how it is
Vivix: ...wow. they overdo it a bit, but well...whatever
Hmm, Littlest pet shop
not sure if i want to give it a chance
I like it- I want to know as little as absolutely possible
never knew hasbro owned littlest petshop
Vivix: well i understand that. that's a real spoiler
Eli its not overdoing it
I probably wont watch it- but I won't switch off it is an on
there are places you can go to talk spoilers
but you can't unhear them
hang on
yeah, I didn't know anything about it until a few days ago
ive heard some of the s3 songs
that one is HEAVY twilight inspired
in fact, I knew so little htat that !cd would have been a shock to me
http://derpiboo.ru/images/127704
guynooneremembers: yeah, we're just talking about it not to talk about it. so don't
http://theadmin.co.uk/NewImages/dRStYQ.jpg
if this isnt based on twilight, i will eat that hat
huh
SCIENCE http://i.imgur.com/O1ezt.jpg
Eli: i wont spoil anything, take it easy
The artist of the Timberwolf & Shadowbolt is the same that made these last year http://i48.servimg.com/u/f48/17/18/27/45/dsc00214.jpg

sparkarez: im houling at the moon!

I might check that show out, but.. I don't think it's my kinda show. Good talent, but not my kinda format
I dont have a current picture of my entire collection :) it would take a few to show them all off
And of course, talent can't make up for premise, if it's ap remise you don't enjoy
damn you nick
I wish I knew how to make stuff like that. :'(
http://i48.servimg.com/u/f48/17/18/27/45/dsc00113.jpg my collection as of January - its 10 times bigger, at least, with all the merch added
and not counting the blind bags, Mcdonald toys, and new customs since then

The only posters I have are the 4 free ones from Walmart :D

Cypresswolf, ooh myy man that is awesome

sparkarez Theres a line of wanting to wait and getting it as you go. Or spoiling it beforehand knowing what'll happen etc
Cypresswolf: you should see my friend buying soda, he throws it EVERYWHERE
Cypresswolf: The burns in your lap say otherwise
Lil_B wha?
:D
I have no comeback to that one :)
Dken2021 WITH Scope, (not in this picture) and a Handgun version
oh just noticed its just 3 more weeks
bet that controller would have been shait
Lil_B but it's a big chunk of plastic......
chat? chat?! live!!!!
Dken2021 yes, and Honestly, If IU had to decide between this and the Wii Light-Gun... I would choose the Wii thing -.-
yay
Lil_B: Isn't it just a lightgun?
currently it ahas 10% of it's goal reached after 3 days. 27 more days to go for the 500k Dollar goal
Fl00t4hSh41 yes, sometimes when I'm not sure if I should use a "-" I just use whatever comes to mind first
:3 I have a game for everypony - guess what drink in my hand right now :)
Cypresswolf: Cider?
Cypresswolf: Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster?
nope - I'll give you a hint: its a grape drink

ded
i love a smart girl with medical knowledge ,3
:D
shit
fluttercry: i dont like it ethier
fluttercry: I dislike most of them...
most people would have panicked
You know, she's taking the whole "found a mutilated body on the beach" really well.
fluttercry: poor you, eat bacon
and he would have died, but i love smart girls <3
Fl00t4hSh41: Kinda interesting to see what he does now that he's blind
why is she so calm about the heavily mutilated man
fluttercry, you do realize that anime is just a cartoon right?
08,01fluttercry: it's one of my favourites
fluttercry: I like anime. I hate this show.
death to the nonbelever
pony_449: BUT THERE IS NO BACON :O:O:O

Wha
05,15Some I like. Like Cowboy Bebop
08,01fluttercry: i actually share your distaste for most animes
What did she do with his arm?
GENIUS
08,01there are only a few i like
rdibp|nyu: dont lie
saying you hate anime is like saying you hate cartoons that comes from Japan
not to u fluttercry to the guy on the ground
CrimsonPhoenix, literally
because of twincest
CrimsonPhoenix: I think he said distate, not hate
I like WAY too much anime :D
08,01Nyu: i have no idea what that is
05,15CrimsonPhoenix then I guess I dislike most cartoons from japan. Sue me
*distaste
imma go get myself some julebrus, brb
08,01but by the way you said it, i'm guessing it involves gay sex.

DerpyMuffins: Born with them, if my memory serves

They're just that close.
Ouran is actually pretty entertaining.

Not a fan.

08,01WW
WWWWW
CrimsonPhoenix: since when does dislike mean hate?
2,14 they do it as a joke because apparantly girls like forbidden love
cowvarkian, internet
CrimsonPhoenix: or is that what it always meant
/me crosses Ouran off his "Animes to Watch" list
RainbowAsh: ah, ok
08,01Caramel: still EW
why did they give him an IV for brused ribs, and a few cuts?
RainbowAsh: that explains it
Woah! Its 2pm already??
05,15CrimsonPhoenix You are reading way too much into this. I didn't say I hate it because it's japanese, I said I disliked most anime. Doesn't mean that I hate the origin.
Lol.
Caramel: yeah, it's sort of a parody/deconstruction of reverse harem/Shoujo series
"silly buy, there are no suh things as machine guns"
and I'm back :) had chilli Con Cane

Ninjazz: Well, Holla! anyway. :)
*movie
axe gang better

RainbowAsh: Well, the Kanji themselves are not that terrefying. But if you also look at the vocabulary that go with it, the different ways of pronouncing it... it is a lot
ouch
fluttercry, it was definitely louder yesterday
Dken2021: me too
05,15CrimsonPhoenix I was talking about the dubbing
oooooh
deodasiefnaisfnsedg

she has great assets
pony_499, pong.
I won't blame you. >_<
But warn me, is the B movie worth the time?

Butt.
Finally, i've used this correctly
:D
god dammit Ninjazz
05,15If I turn it up loud enough to hear it then the pings are too loud
Dramatic pause

05,15Also, yeah, even if the sound is up, there's something wrong somewhere, my pings are ear piercingly loud and the movie is whisper quiet. Dken2021 yeah, this is a comedy

block
haha
that sound
Lil_B: No, not shamisen
now Xinzao
ASoftFluffyThing but I think Koto is the japanese guitar
Lil_B: Shamisen is smaller and more like guitar
lawl
lmao
his turn
JunkerKun thanks :P
Lil_B, I doubt it's a shamisen. Shamisen you hold like a guitar
Chinese BASS CANNON!
Atleast the music is good.
Your music is no mnatch for my spears!
This isn't looking so good...
Lil_B, I thing koto is the name of it. Gonna look it up real quick
Ryunosuke, Pfft that's nothing
and the effects are too
I think the Koto is a Japanese instrument.
dance
ASoftFluffyThing we are thinking about the same 2 Instruments, but can't decide which one is which :P
Kencolt: So is shamisen
Kencolt both are
fail
Lil_B, yep it's a koto
Kencolt: You are assuming they are Chinese hitmen
So, this being a CHINESE film, it's probably a similar, but not the same instrument.
sooo close.
he got damn close tho
Kencolt: But as far as I know shamisen and koto were created in China
O.o
epic
They are DRESSED like Ch8inese Hitmen.
No! Not that guy!
holy crap
Thats two masters down

Lets get back to the movie

Did they just steal from a mute woman????
What's she saying?
Lil_B: I am just pragmatic. :D

What a twist
RainbowAsh, you have more chance asking Sumica
what in the hell is this?
Katalenic: eyup Chanllenge aprove ^^
aww Lolipop
Epithany!
Mega_Milk mute and deaf,I think
OH LOLLY, GIMME GIMME GIMME :3
MadSurge yeah, but not in this Movie with this character in this moment :(
dawwww
Ouh..
Oh... mai...
:s
Mega_Milk mute and deaf
ohshi-
Fl00t4hSh41, lots of people from mlp are working on it, so why not give it a try?
Dat hurt
eww
WHAT A BUNCH OF LOSERS
oh hay Ninjazz ^^
:(
CrimsonPhoenix, thanks, maybe I will. ^^
awww
Jarate isn't fun
:'(
D'AWWWWWWWWWWW
What is this!?
Hey Invi.
What the fuck is this movie.
sad
LOLLY WHY?
cow334 when the movie B end it's better to you tell me the truth if you finished the game or not u.u
That's a quite long flash back
hey YO wuts up everyony:) aww shit the sad part
WER TEH LOVE
Thorn Kung Fu Hustle
I oughta ask Sumi to try streaming Ninja Turtles since it's right after MLP and he already has the live feed on anyways
TEH LOVE
hi scout19_tf2
wow that is a very very very old lollipop.
D:
Is she mute or what?
Wait RainbowAsh are you seriously considering watching a show because people in there also worked in MLP?
LOLLIPOP
:(
that's retarded
Mega_Milk but still sealed
MadSurge mute and deaf
It was probably stale anyways
hes a ass
Is that lollipop good after all those years?
That was sad.
Can someone help me? What is this? I'm confused...
:'( he broke the Lolipop
that guys a dick
NO FUCK THE LOLLIPOP BITCH
05,15CrimsonPhoenix isn't that basically how MLP got popular? Because people from PPG worked on it?
:s
CrimsonPhoenix, that was basically my initial reason to watch ponies, so why not?
noot the lollipop
05,15and Fosters
So sad oart
Katalenic: i promise i wont lie if i dont beat it
part
ASoftFluffyThing: it's pure sugar, those must last for a while
Ah.
daww this ending
RainbowAsh: Those voice actors work on a whole lot of shows, including a lot of bad onees
and the otherguy still gave him some loot
This is the end?
no
Nope.
RainbowAsh: why do you think LPS won't be shit?
My initial reason to watch MLP was because it got so much attention.
Thorn nowhere close
It's only the beginning
dat mambo
oh shit.
It wasn't my number 1 reason
no theres much more
Yup Thorn, these are the credits xD
I'll wait for the crowd to sort it out.
then again it's mostly VAs in there
Why does this remind me of sleeping dogs?
Music= Night Club Band (no, thats really the name of the soing)
AWW FUCK
05,15If it's just VAs then yeah, that's not worth it. A bunch of VAs from ponies are in Strawberry SHortcake, and that's never good
fluttercry: Ikr
I had to go what did I miss?
my first time wating mlp my friend forced me
hmmm
Oh. If it's just that, then nvm.
thats a change of luck -lol
cool hat
fluttercry: Shortcake... ugh...
Lil_B, liek the song ''sing sing sing'' which is completly instrumental? ^^
Sabre Dance :)
Fl00t4hSh41, some of the writers are working on it, too. I have no idea how good it is going to be, really, but I am willing to give it a fair try before making up my mind.
ohia DerpStar. Dunno, what's the last thing you remember?
Invi xD
Hello Ninjazz :3
fromt he movie
fluttercry: Well Larson's a writer and Ingram's doing the music
fluttercry: i think it was to do with proving that animation can still be done by a lone innovator instead of a large animation group
What did he do with the lolipop?
Invi another kind of ironic
boy scouts.....................with tanks
DerpStar: threw it into a wall
those boy scouts... with a tank.... seems legit
DerpStar: threw it against a wall
uhm DerpStart, u dun wanna know
Hey MadSurge.
DerpStar he smashed it against a wall and ran.
DerpStar*
DerpStar: He slapped her hand so the lollipop fell down
"It's only a model'
That scout's a spy!
Chinese boyscouts are serious business
A VA is only as good as the material he or she is given. Thinkon that.
...
EVILLLLLLLLLL
ZUUUUL
Chinese Military Shovel > Swiss Army Knife
I've got a baaad feelings about this..
Suddenly freak weather
Lil_B: Lol
Crap what was the A movie again
I admit I was kinda interested for the hilarity purpose
Lil_B seems legit
dinkleberg!!!!!!!
Bad juju.
I'm sorry, random buisness dude with no reason, but what the fuck are you saying?
05,15As much as I respect Faust, I don't think she's the only reason MLP is good. It takes an entire team, not just one person
Why did I never watch an insane asylum as a boy scout :(
Oh No :( I thought that would turn him good, and unlock his chi potential or something Chinese like that
though from what I saw the animation is mediocre
Canadian_Brony you have to see the Video about it xD
indeed fluttercry
fluttercry, agreed.
mitamaking, you are watching it, kung fu hustle
oh yeah
lo
And why is there a thunder tornado over that random building?
fluttercry: But still without Lauren there would be no MLP as we know it now
barrel roll
Inb4 the Shining
my main problem with LPS is the setting. I can't see how it could be interesting. MLP has adventure and supernatural threats
fluttercry: they all worked together to make the show as awesme as it is no lone wolf in it they work as a team ^^
AND WHERE THE FUCK AND WHO THE FUCK IS THAT DOUCHEBAG
inception.
Shining refference, because had to be there
WHAT IS THIS I DONT EVEN
D:
Wht Fl00t4hSh41 said
blood
Fl00t4hSh41: lps?
REDRUM
05,15yup. Dat Shining
looks legit
Whats LPS gonna bring in? An evil bank who wants to forclose on their mortage?
So much blood.
it's only cherryaid
Guise, go watch Saberspark's Ballad of the Brony for the best truths about why MLP is so awesome
Fl00t4hSh41: We have to idea WHAT the setting of LPS will be. We must wait and see3.
Dat blood
The Shinnin'
I dont even wanna know.
Thorn this movie works on some fucked up logic. Take the sudden river of blood for instance.
Littlest Pet Ship
LPS is extreme Slice of lif style of show
fluttercry: if it was only Faust, then S2 would have sucked
*shop
now where is that pyschic kid
This place be so haunted.
05,15MadSurge exactly
That's the strange the blood should get off on the second floor
inb4 creepy twins
he's ingisted fear gas
worse, teenage slice of life show
05,15And though I sort of disliked S2, it wasn't terrible
this is the face of EVIL
So season 3 will be streamed here at 10:00am right?
Now I'm reminded of Alton Tower's nemisis.
that crazy guy
just ignore all the laws of physics as you know it and you're cool.
05,15DerpStar yup
Uh.
okaay...
that guy :D
nice flip flops
ok..
Pure Evil
05,15To be honest, if I had found MLP in the middle of S2, I probably wouldn't have stuck with it
If you dont know, its an inverted rollercoaster with rivers of blood
Sitting on da toilet!
fluttercry: and from what I saw about S3 we can expect good times :)
hello everypony, what're we watchin'?
dat voice
He's a casual Killer
hi BroHoof. Kung Fu Hustle
its ol man asian
fluttercry: season 1 is far surperior
Dark_Horst, kung fu hustle
he eats ciggarettes
And who the fuck is this?
badass voicer
05,15Amen Bronysith
*voice
Hello BroHoof we're watching Kung Fu Hustle
Hi BroHoof
But still...nice flipflops.
MadSurge, you only saw a fraction of season 3
Huzzah
kung fu hustle
Ryunosuke: i didnt ask that
Season 1 fluttershy is different to season 2
fluttercry to be honest, I don't like half the episodes, in both seasons, if there wouldn't be a fandom, I wouldn't even watch it
dude his flipflops are the stuff
Dark_Horst, oh
kung fu..lovely
chat scrolled too fast :p
she's a bit annoying in S2 in my opinion
sup BroHoof we are wating kung fu hustle
and I would agree on fluttercry about season 1 vs season 2 though I am still searching for the reasons why
I think the charm just loses the effect over time.
CrimsonPhoenix: secret, I didn't watch any of the previews. Only written rumors
I don't think it's that
fail
that punch
haha
lol
ha
dat asain
DANM
harder
ooh, kinky
kinky
Dayum
HARDER:[
kinky ...i see
fluttercry: season 2 did have luna eclipsed though...lol
ha
BITCH SLAP
dem guns
too hard?
:)
O-O
cought it
I am IRON MAAAAAN
05,15Bronysith oh you mean the most overrated episode of the series?
O.o
like a boss
oh snap
:O
Whoa
Neo
peace dood
MATRIX
Now I'm waiting for the rape scene waiting to happen.
what in the hell O_O
fluttercry: thats not the most overrated episode, a friend in need is
fluttercry: Or at least the most overplayed here during BMN
fluttercry, not the sonic rainboom one?
/me bows before sonic grandpa
boom
I did not Like the Luna episodes, everyone acted unnatural, sit made no sense, and the moral was butchered
fluttercry: i think winter wrap up is my fav episode, idk why
Wait, what kind of bullet is that?
Dayum
hmmm........
05,15Nah. Sonic Rainboom was at least good the first time I saw it
Thorn: Paper bullet
fluttercry, And Lesson Zero?
wut o.O
Thorn: I totally saw it bend under his fingers
Ohhh
Lil_B: I'll second that although Luna grew on me after a few watchings
CASINO NINJA
i liked party of one my favorite so far
A friend in deed has one of the best, most complete song in the entire series and explores Pinkie's character
Best episode discussion? A friend in Deed, hooves down.
05,15Ninjazz like Sonic Rainboom, I enjoyed it the first time.
HOOKER ALERT
I don't have a favourite episode.
Sonic Rainboom is actually great
red_ony I have nothing against Luna in this episode... I hated everyone else in this episode
fluttercry, Oh first time? I get you there.
05,15Winter Wrap Up is still the high bar for me.
Im gonna kill you with death until you die.
i hate it when i meow at cats, and they dont meow back. Unbelievably rude.
look before you sleep...idiot twilight is too cute
fluttercry: huh?
What is the worst MLP ep then?
Also, would homestucks fit into the brony fandom>
heck the sonic rainboom moment is IMO the best moment in the series
here we go Fight
Who doesn't bring a giant bell when infiltrating the enemy lair?
Thorn: homestucks are the worst fandom
just maybe for that stretch
05,15Worst? Mysterious Mare Do Well
Lil_B: Her ancient way of speaking just didn't work for me at first..oh well :D
Fl00t4hSh41 *slowly raises a hoof*
red_ony especially Pinkie Pie, the lesson should have been that you shouldn't make pranks or jokes if it hurts someone
Violence won't save us..
Yeah... Didn't like that one much either
fluttercry: i find the season 2 finale to be overrated
05,15Bronysith oh I completely forgot about that
05,15Yeah
It was just rushed.
O-O
The songs in the finale were meh.
his face
Lil_B: but hurting someone sometimes is really fun :)
It's not overrated any more.
hehehehehehe
I mean the....less than perfect part of the brony fandom and
O.o
why do so many of these characters sound like gergman voice actors i've heard a thousand times?
Lil_B: brill moral
BBBFF and Love is in bloom were awesome songs though...
Dat unnecessary slow-mo
i am very confused
ded
HOLY SHIT KUNG FU HOOKER
05,15Ninjazz remember when it came out and everyone was like "ZOMG BEST EPISODE BEST SONG AHHHHHH"
Dark_Horst it's an English dub.
Dark_Horst Maybe they are 'better' with the accents?
what are your favorte mlp songs
What happened to the fat guy?
Canadian_Brony: i know. i still heard these voices before many times
fluttercry I voted for Winter Wrap Up as best song..
red_ony . . . erm ... no sorry, but I see no good in hurting someone
fluttercry: Not the best but still kind of good. I personally liked it
fluttercry: yea, People only like this day aria because it is a villain song
fucking hell
best songs are winter wrap up and smile smile smile.
this day aria is best song though imo, and i could care less about the grammar nazis
fluttercry, could you blame them? End of the season, high expectations, big flashly lights, OOO SHINY effect.
This day aria was surprising for being the now only villain song in the whole series
fluttercry: it's not the best episode, but it comes close. At least for me.
Imaginary fighting!
fluttercry: Well everyone here goes BEST EPISODE/BEST SONG the first time they play here
O.o
ouch
EVERY episode almost
Dark_Horst Which ones do you mean,though.I could make out Will Smith's german voice,anything else?
Canadian_Brony: Its the best song after this Day, which really is in a league of its own
for example, the guy in the yellow shirt. i'm deadsure he's a german VA. heard his voice many times in german dubs
Lil_B: I wasn't serious.. I share your thoughts on the episode
what is this?
Discord was a good villain
eeyup
i didnt think season two finaly was that great i liked it i just didnt like what they did when celestia went against chryasli there should have been a battle
wish he didn't give up so easily
headphones are coming out.
its not very effective......
05,15Bronies have a tendency to declare everything fantastic when it first runs, then later go back on that
kung fu hustle
For when you cant afford the reall fight scene because of health issues and oh wait nevermind
red_ony oh, sry I tend to take things to serious sometimes xD
fluttercry: also, chrysallis is easily the most idiotic villain and worst villain of the series
I think that's the case for most people, fluttercry.
hey guys im back
MORTAL KOMBAT
Ninjazz agreed
Wb rdibp :)
hi rdibp
wb rdibp
Bronysith: Huh? Really
welcome back rdibp
[aunch
paunch*
I'm sorry, I just saw the potential for that joke.
I'd say she was indeed Bronysith
oh shit

my only issue is that it clearly should have been a b movie as it was a parody of other b rated kung fu movies :)
secret of my excess was it?
return of harmony after the 3 hours movie... i don't know if i can do this that long xDD
oooo very nice choices
9/10 for comedy
I'm glad that somehow my connection is actually keeping up with stream.
Ryunosuke: i tried voting it as a B, i was told its A
Ninjazz: same here ._.
05,15It's the same reason why I disliked Kung Pow. The idea of "Weren't old Kung Fu movies awful, look at how awful they were" can only take you so far
can any one type on name from the stream?
Ninjazz, I know right? when is our internet that goof?
Chanllege?
Canadian_Brony, stop making me feel old ;_;

Okay. So how bout 2012 then?
i like the movie with the guy in the box the whole time ^^

What is B and A-movie anyway?
Nows ponies and then B movie...Fuuuuuuu
/me glomps Caramel
I still can't feel the difference
I would say that A or B deppends how much you self was entertained by the movie , but it isnt like that :/
Terry Pratchett *claps* :$
05,15ahh the ol ban hammer. It's been too long

Hi guys
PONYS NOW
Caramel: Very high for Hong Kong. Much more CGI than is the norm, some big name actors (Well over there) and also noted as possibly one of the greatest Wuxia parodies ever written-- again, to the tastes of Hong Kong. And me. I tend to agree with them.
We can still save Derpy, from getting replace.

Ponies, Y U teach Spike greed?
is spike humping the glass
Gems aren't that valuable in Equestria. Stick a shovel in the ground and you pull up a bunch, nobody minds Spike eating them, etc.
lol
i blame the cakes for making spike a monster
Sumica what? DAMMIT I missed AJ's bedroom eyes? FFUUUUUUUU-

Hello everypony!

hi
Combustiblelemons . . . TO YOUTUBE!!
Hello VenHur!
Squishy cheeeeeeks!
hi VenHur
fluttercry, if Rarity just coerces Spike, why does she keep his gift in such high esteem? Her behavior at the end makes it clear, it's not just because of its material worth.
hat
So much for savouring that.
Dem sad Pony ears <3

Hai VenHur
FWEE HAT
Gee I wonder why Cheerliee bought a pimp hat...
I hear so much Celestia in Cheerilee, does anyone else?
this is how I made my fist ponyfic

Why does Cheerilee have a pimp hat in her grocry bag?
SWAG-hat Cheerilee must become an official toy!
Spike has found: Hustler's Hallmark
BroHoof: i know but still its where it alllllllllllllllll started

And the Swag begins

Lickety Split
Pinkies4thWall: I'm not entirely sure she counts as a background pony
Lickety Split revived
Pinkies4thWall, I think she has a few too many lines to be a true background pony. More of a minor supporting character imho.
Lickety Split was a G1 character. And female.
More like a recurring character
oh spyke..
05lickety split is best big mac ship
The reason why Cheerliee had a pimp hat, cause Cheerliee is a whooooore
:D
lol
oh god...

hey temme
00,10hello TVNOOD
: D
i meen tvnood
Hey TVNOOD
grab some snacks cuz this is gonna take a while
Technically it's a TV miniseries edited together into a movie, but whatever.
So what is this movie about?
So whats next?
TVNOOD it's called "Colour of Magic" and . . . I actually have no idea what it's about.
00,10it's about magic and it's color
Stormman3100 see aoveb
is it any good?
*above
Alchemist, fluttercy, all I know is they would never intentionally ship any of the mane 6 with each other, all the soccer moms would lynch the hasbro executives. Was it put in as an easter egg of sort? There is a slight probablity. More importantly, I never get why people get worked up about topics like this. It's just such a minor detail.
colourful magic.
An incompetent wizard who agrees to take a naive tourist on a tour around the sights of Discworld, and get into all sorts of scrapes along the way.
Mmmmm popcorn! :)
ah, just got back with mah food
05,15It's based off of the Discworld series, If you all know what that is.
05pushing 46k dps in ilevel 457 gear

yep. intermission is indeed food time
TVNOOD: About one of the greatest fantasy series ever written. Discworld. By Terry Pratchett. Think Lord of the rings meets HitchHiker's Guide to the Galaxy... but a lot funnier.
Being a admin of a Steam group can sometimes be hard work. But it all pays off. Trust me :3
05,15From what I here, it's actually good. Just very long
Cool.
I was an admin once. It wasn't fun.
05,15It's got Tim Curry and Jeremy Irons, it can only be so bad
RainbowAsh: I know, thats why I said I dont want to get into, because it might end in a flame war.
fluttercry: It is. It was passed Midnight for me when it was finshed ;~;
00,10it's got death who is best pony fluttercry

I opted out from watching what I could yesterday and decided to lurk instead

I've never seen this
MadSurge, since he apparently some one of note, good?
tim curry?
MadSurge I'm dressing up as death this year. Then I can walk up to my teachers and say "Yo what's up"
I imagined Rincewind to be much younger
*_*
wherever a tim curry plays it's gotta be a good movie
He's described as much younger in the books.
dem eyes
JUMP!
Samwise Gamgee, first tourist on the Disc
Canadian_Brony: No, no, you should say: "YO, WHAT'S UP"

and suddenly Death
Hahaha.
Ninjazz: he was Pennywise in It and Nigel in The Wild Thornberries :D
I LIKE DEATH BECAUSE HE TALKS LIKE THAT
SUDDEN DEATH
Who'd have thought a hobbit gets that much around

the transvestite from rocky horror
He was in Clue, which we've seen on Bronystate. And It, and Rocky Horror, and lot sof things.
/me 08,01was never very interested in reading novels until he read Discworld
does anyone want to add me on steam?
08,01MadSurge: i read all of them by the time i was 16
sure i will
is it just me or does this movie seem to be skipping forward? is my stream just being weird?
Yay I have no school Friday! :3
08,01and bought the hardback of every new on ethat came out since then
:D
awesome
I do Bajocontinuo
now im a boy
08,01i have a few of my Discworld books signed too
look at my muscles!
You play TF2?
i am bajocontinuo2
08,01in fact, maybe even about half of them
yep
im amazing!
i LOVE tf2
Coolzies!! :D
/me flexes
sounds like a lovely place
The first two Discworld books aren't really the best to start on though. They're good, just very different from the others. PTerry hit his stride in Mort though.
xx12coldaysxx
Vash: Skipping? Not on my end. Try refreshing.
08,01LordDerpington: i started on Wyrd Sisters and Soul Music
TF2 is fun but I suck at it :P
Reaper Man was my first.
^same here
i can show you to play better Ponies47
My first novel was the Hogfather
same here
...o.o
Stuck atop of a Fluttershy :D
mines was a crappy rip off of harry potter
Snaaaake!
darn it
My steam refuses to load..
And Death is waiting :D
Badger Badger Badger Badger
the stream is lagging for me
Ponies47 give me your steam username so that i can add you
<- It's my Bstate nickname Bajocontinuo :P
Death: please die kthx xoxo
08,01in fact, i only ever read short stories as a kid
08,01until Discworld
Saved by the luggage.
Bstate??? what do you mean Ponies47?
08,01because i'm a very slow reader, and I have ADHD
wtf?
what a twist
The luggage doubles as a coffin?
you have adhd? didn't know that
Bajocontinuo: Bronystate.
oooo
ADHD? i have ADH- i love squirlls, oh hey i should learn to tango!
08,01DaringDerpy: i've read Dune
are they still making discworld novles?
08,01the first 3 books, anway
I never read books
they are still making new ones
but really, me too
08,01MadSurge: fucking fantastic
08,01everything LotR should have been
oooh joy
08,01but wasn't, because LotR is about as interesting to read as a shopping list
2,14 in your opinion
08,01John Major's shopping list.
MadSurge: Me too. Ironically i lost my interest of books shortly after i started school
08,01yes, in my opinion
I like reading shopping lists though
2,14 some people actually enjoy the book that began and inspired an entire generation of fantasy genres
08,01i'm one of the few people who doesn't like it
I am trying to add you Ponies47 but steam is derping around
SirGanjalf, school is generally very good at destroying interests in things.
08,01i'm just not a fan of the writing style, Caramel
I despise lord of the rings though
I don't like the Hobbit
Caramel: don't be silly. Nobody ever read LOTR
now i think i got t
i reade LOTR!
I can't read LoTR. Too long and drones me out.
Bajocontinuo: Your on mah friends list now :P
08,01Caramel: it's undoubtedly an influential book, it's just not to my taste
I read it when I was 14!
Uhm Bajocontinuo I can't add you cus I haven't got full membership...
Only LOTR book I read
Ponies47: *you're
Howdy
Bronysith: Ok smartass
Reading LoTR is very slow going. Good books though.
I hate how LOTR is so damn popular, it just takes so long to develop and even the supposed good parts are decent at best and are only few and far between for me
I was never able to finish LOTR. Each time I try, around the time they talk around 70 pages about a campfire I get bored out of my mind.
*being
i read through LOTR 3 times
suffocation
of course i can!!!
and i will
SirGanjalf, so you are saying most fantasy fans haven't read LOTR?
his room was air tight except for the keyhole?
And Death
SirGanjalf: the bible is a piece of hack writing anyway...<_<
yep, that was dark
ʸᵃʸ :D
RainbowAsh: pretty much
http://s1260.photobucket.com/albums/ii571/flutterchu2/?action=view&current=Screenshot2012-10-16at70114PM_zps8eafa49e.png
Yes, Vash. The book was a bit clearer on that point.
I'm happy I'm not the only one that couldn't get around finishing reading the books
i added you Banjocontiinuo
08,01Sweet_Tea: i didn't particularly enjoy the films either
Heresy.
Coldays: You have Steam?
yes
what is that?
dat rock
BladedWings: It's fine for me
oh my god that island is floating
BladedWings, nope
darn it lag
Fl00t4hSh41, I like the bible as a historical document.
-_-
That's a mighty fine rock
Coldays: I can add you. What's your Steam name?
added pinkieshe:dash :)
odd...i cant seem to connect...i cant see my comics :(
08,01MadSurge: i saw both the David Lynch film and the recent miniseries
08,01there are good and bad points about both
soo... why was his room air tight?
BladedWings: Yes, all day. It's busted on my ADSL connection, but fine via 3G. There's a router broken after the hop to New York, according to traceroute.
i just addded you and its xx12coldaysxx
RainbowAsh: You would be hard pressed to find egyptoligists who would agree
Ask and ye shall receive.
08,01i love some of the design and production on the Lynch movie
Good bye guys :)
bye sonicdude558
08,01well
whoops
Who's your ISP, out of curiosity, BladedWings ?
hi death
08,01i like most of the design and production on that
seeya sonicdude558
we meet again
bye sonicdude558
I tried reading through the lotr but Its so god damn long so the book stretches out too much so its like 100 pages of the characters talking about things useless to the story, but I do like the look of the new hobbit movie
ah
Bye sonicdude558
psssssssssst
LordDerpington: Southern Coastal Cable
sworf in the stone
That sword sounds like john cleese
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Opening/Animation: Trotting Dead
Fl00t4hSh41, it's an account that is obviously colored by the perspective and intentions of its writers, but its an account nonetheless.
Lilarcor, is that you?
still confused buy this @.@
excaliber?
BladedWings: Hm. Seems to be affecting a lot of people in the UK then.
Magic swords are awfully picky.
My Steam is Ponies47 but I'm pretty I've added almost all of you guys on Steam already :P
Coldays: nope
Daring Do!
*pretty sure

I love the metallic reverb that the sword has! :D
daring do at go
Daring Doo!!!!
daring do is a fantastic pony
And then Daring Do.

Dark_Horst: Hogsward
Caumen: The Colour Of Magic
Caumen color of magic
Meanwhile: That's what I asked last night! But no, it's some no-name called James Perry.
A... a... a DRAGON?

BladedWings: Yes, same here.
GilDash: Ah, alright then.
or ill chop your head off
John Cleese is best sword
For some reason, it makes me thing of monty python
Everything else working fine, just dA not responding.

:D
Transparent dragons!
transparant dragon?
active camo
So is she like Wonder Woman and that's her invisible dragon?
looks more like alpha issue
Dragons are see-through. That's a neat idea.
o.o
its a patch
MadSurge: The damned lizard isn't real unless you believe in it
10/10
Meanwhile: Oh, it's nothing like that at ALL... you'll see.
Hence being see through
Meanwhile: that's why they can't see them!
The dragons fade as they get further from the Wyrmberg. That's why they aren't seen all over Discworld.
Dragonlady.
I love that Game
bad dragon
LordDerpington: Its a fluke of the wyrmberg
This is a game?
Mortal Kombat!
bcb: no
In the discworld there are proper dragons though
Very high magic field, see.

Hey Sweet_Tea

And then theres the swarmp dragons

The size of a cat or small dog and prone to exploding
And they just burp stink, not fire.
Guess who got one of the great spells, guys
LordDerpington: Oh, they have fire, they do. Sam Vimes can attest to that.
what his name
LordDerpington: Flamable gasses. Thats why they also explode when too excited
the wizard with the sword
Rincewind
Twoflower is very naive.

Wrek: i concur
05got cheese, creme fraice, grinded tacho spiced meat and salsa
Twoflower gets ALL the luck.
Dat dragon likes Twoflowers
I guess he's entitled to it after he helped carry Frodo up Mount Doom.
Ninjazz: of course, Rincewind is a butt monkey :D
:D
That doesn't excuse his terrible choice in clothing.
Ninjazz: but, tourist clothes!
MadSurge, his misfortunes are entertaining to watch though.
~i tried my best to block out the screams. but there haunting me in my dreams~
Ninjazz: Thats how tourists dress
MadSurge, statement stands.
Ninjazz: yep :D
lolz

Hey Sketch_Toku_Brony
Sketch_Toku_Brony: The Colour of Magic
Oh Twoflower, you always had a way with the wyrmkinesses.
LordDerpington, ouh, thanks .-. I didn't expect anyone would actually do it... You earned a muffin :P
Ninjazz: bow chika w-ah, nevermind
If only Sam could've summoned a dragon to fly the ring to Mordor...
LordDerpington: i thought only dragon lords could summon them though
Dat CGI dragon
MadSurge, you never know...
goooood.... spring rolls with apple sauce was one of my best ideas yet :)
Lvl 1 Mage on a flying mount?
twilight_sprinkle: In the book, it clarifies that you have to really *believe* in dragons to do it, not just imagine them.
Bye sword :P
damn tourists.....
giggity
lol wha?
okay LordDerpington
Meanwhile: why? He did fine without it. Shame Frodo survived :D
I don't think I'll make it through the whole movie.I'll probably see some of you next week.
bye
There was no way they would have included the aeroplane bit in this adaptation. It was seriously random.
MadSurge: would've gone much quicker though.
he fell asleep
well, shit
shame
ah man that sword reminded me of Dave the Barbarian :D funny show
XD
:D
Hey everpony!! :)
rofl
Ninjazz: he just needs a Bad Dragons
Death!
ohai Death

Buffer D:
Ninjazz: ... ...
what is with him and traps?
I'm starting to believe this movie has no end, amIright?
Eli, best not to google Bad Dragon then.
traps r fun!
Ninjazz: Bad Dragon requires a REALLY high tollerace for bad/bizzare porn though
Ninjazz: i did
Eli, don't say I didn't warn you.
Ninjazz: you did...
Fl00t4hSh41, it wasn't that bad. I've seen worse really.
dafuq are you talking about?
Ninjazz: you warned me, but you dind't prepare me for it

Oh look. A movie.
Bad Dragon you say? OK, Chrome incognito mode, ho!

TWOFLOWER, Y U NO ASIAN?
Bye MadSurge
Rimbow?
rimbow dash incoming
Meanwhile, as far as i know, he never published a book like that and the closest he had was the book ''Azatoth''
Double rimbow!
ooh...
aaah...
Peter griffin voice "HE SAID IT"
dat title drop
aww, no sea troll ;(
boat
or not?
Invi: Probably because he didn't publish it, it's a commemorative edition.
Of course two flower can't see the 8th colour. Only wizards can
incoming sea troll??
its what makes them wizards
Twoflower just bleeds good fortune.
ninjazz: but he's not asian in this, so i hate him.
I name it...Equestria :P
Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my AAGH
how the f is this a b movie?
anyone else bummed out about the SH HD Collection? :S makes me wanna save up to make a gaming PC and play the originals
adasdad, not even for Samwise the Brave?
The Legend of Luggage should be it's own movie.
05PinkieSpice: B movie =/= bad movie
They should make all the Discworld books into films
Meanwhile: i would watch the exrement out of that.
Sketch_Toku_Brony: why would you need a new pc for this?
PinkieSpice because it's so looong
Wrek: I know. But this should be an A movie
PinkieSpice, wasn't released in cinema, and technically it's not a movie, since it's actually two.
oh
is both part being played?
PinkieSpice, yes
its a b movie probably because its a tv movie
Meanwhile, he just wrote the history and the chronology of the necronomicon, not the book. he just mentioned it several times
yay
I spy with my little eye
meh, the boks where a lot better, and this isn't very true to the source material.
I'm probably going to skip the second part. It's already 7:30am.
Ninjazz: Go to bread...
Hello friends~
and a miss
Hey Bjornfot
Invi it's just called The Necronomicon. It's just a collection of his writing.
Did I mention I finally got that which I have sought out for ages
He sounds like Nigel thornberry
Ponies47, after this part. Or when the buffers got to the point where I can't tollerate them any more.
[Alpha] Tim Curry voices Nigel Thornberry
Thank you
Ninjazz: Good idea :P
red_ony: well the pc im using is REALLY old and i would want to make a good gaming pc sometime next year so i can get into pc gaming like TF2 ect.
[Alpha] so in a way that is Nigel Thornberry
Sketch_Toku_Brony: you could always buy a ps 2
Sketch_Toku_Brony: on the cheap
My new computer runs TF2 like a boss. I wub it <3
im back and i c ur all watching toviehe none stop m
Sketch_Toku_Brony the old SH Games run very good on my 6 year old laptop, so go on and play ;)
Meanwhile, it is? can you PM me the ISBN number?
/me glomps Ish
typo
Sketch_Toku_Brony: You should do it before Sony/MS releases next console.
reminds me of the game magics
/me punchs Bjornfot
scout19_tf2: english please
Invi: Maybe, what's an ISBN number?
OH YEAH! Tim Curry was also the Soviet Premier in Command and Conquer Red Alert 3! That's what I've been trying to remember.
A book that can fight ....sweet
the game magicka*
dat krull
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Cause the graphic requirements will probably rise again after it.
Meanwhile: a number that identifies a book
Invi, go to amazon and search for necronomicon
/me is a master of kung fu so he dodges Ish's punch and kicks his ass
Meanwhile, it's a code that you can use to reference any book ever published
The more you know.
THEY GOT HER SKIN COLOR WRONG
Sketch_Toku_Brony: And so the hardware prices
Is that Zoe from firefly?
/me is a master of something and dodges Bjornfot's kicks
BLEEEAUUAUEEG NITPIUCK
Meanwhile, the isbn number is sth like a book ID. it should be uder the barcode of the book
SirGanjalf: for the new console? or do ya mean the parts for a pc?
Invi: Alright, hang on.
Bjornfot no Moleste
Since when can Rincewind fight?
Meanwhile: every book has an isbn number that identifies it without any doubt, it's a global databank thingie
/me is a master of duct tape and ductapes Ish and Bjornfot together
RainbowAsh: since when is twoflower not asian?
05a wonder that a chest filled with gold can swim
Now STFU or I'll tape your mouths shut
/me avoids the ductape
05als
/me molests Wrek

it's a chest of wodners
Wrek, maybe it just walks on the ground. Alternatively: Magic
05No RP
twoflower does seem to be lucky
:P
Wrek: More so than that it can walk?
Sketch_Toku_Brony: I mean, you'll need to invest more in PC hardware to get graphics like on(nextgen) gonsoles

Yw
how long is till the ending
i do like hgow they did krull, at least.
scout19_tf2 4 days
probably
adasdad, when you don't know the source material, this movie is enjoyable though
scout19_tf2: Were still on the first part
Bronysith I am more than okay with that
scout19_tf2: 2 hours or so
I think...
scout19_tf2: We're barely half way
adasdad: Not really fair. Prqatchett himself worked and approved this. Remember, the first book was more a collection of stories.
Well, just over 90 mins.
RainbowAsh: fair enough, but i can't help but go rabbid fanboy on it >.>
can't we just watch the 2nd part another time >.<
Ha I knew it
I'd say this is a passable but unambitious adaptation. It's okay.
Called it
Why does it matter what gender the turtle is.
Meanwhile: Because Science
Meanwhile: in case they meet another space-turtle.
Meanwhile, what if it is going to mate?
SirGanjalf: oh i see well i wasnt gonna play stuff like games out now i was gonna play games like SH 3-4 or TF2 and other games,i was look up some how to stuff and see if there are tutorials on budgets (2-500$),ya know what i mean right? :$
Meanwhile: But thats one of the greatest scientific questions of our era
scout19_tf2 well it might BE 2 hours, but it sure feels like 4 days
that guy reminds me of Michael Palin for some reason
Nice face.
dat face
teletubbies!
Sketch_Toku_Brony: I understand. Anyway 500$ PC should easily run most of today's games
XD
ook
Librarian is best orangutan.
SirGanjalf: :) cool lol though im short on cash this year so im gonna get started next year hopefully :$
Meanwhile: Oook
well i gots to go cya everypony:) good luck watching the movie
Librarians in Metro 2033... D:

what was noise?
Bjornfot: What about them? ...Oh wait, i don't want to know - i didn't finish the book yet.
That is one cheesed off book.
SirGanjalf: Without spoiling anything I can say that they are... unpleasant.
they keep getting higher XD
the world is explanding/
Do none of them know teleport spells?
Meanwhile: Those are insanely dangerous
that chest is midly disturbing
05silly computer

Well at least they're clever about it.
its easy to endup going several hundred kilometers per second in the wrong direction

Pfft, yeah right.
becazuse it is a movie just with passive violence :§
A'tuin genitalia - so pretty
Because silly authors.
yes this movie couldve been a lot shorter
Meanwhile: because anyone else promoted to his job would be just as backstabbing
Does that guy ever play a non-evil role?
Tim Curry you evil bastarrd :D
Ann: He did in Clue.
backstabbing is a wizard tradition at this point in the discworld
Wait... They made a movie of Clue? o.O
but he was a villain in clue
oh
Ann wasn't he the dad in the wild thornberrys
*goes to download*
diskworld is gone....
stupid turtle
Ann: It was much better than it sounds.
Meanwhile he ended being an evil-bastard at the end though
Done?
Oh, that's true.
10/10 Great Movie!!!!!
Thank goodness.
*ended up
Ann: It was shown on Bronystate a few months ago. Much fun was had.
what
end
Backstabbing is a common practice in Discworld anyway.
Can't keep my eyes open anymore.

Oh, I guess I missed it :/

Heh, I'll ahve to watch it now.

cow334: eeeeenope
Time to tell youa bit about the magic of Discworld . Its fuckin dangerous . Sure you get 7 mile boots , but think what might happen when you plan one foot seven milesfrom the other . Not pretty. The unseen university is mainly there to keep wizzards placid and docile so theydont screw up the world too much.
cow334: HAH!

SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE

The end is NEIGH!
You don't HAVE to watch.
Meanwhile: i thought you were permabanned?
RABBLE RABBLE
flutterchu: I thought you were incredibly annoying. Oh wait.
:'(
SirGanjalf calm down people, your just shouting rabble!
not like it is in a normal orbital reentry on earth
Wait... didn't Terry Pratchet write this? It's all coming together now.
Fl00t4hSh41, excuse me?
He played Dracula and Saruman BladedWings
Anyone wanna play the rape game?
the time has come ...
what a smasll student body for such a bit school
In dracula and LOTR respectively
Ninjazz: to orbit the earth you need to go 6000 or more meters per second
Do not worry about the changes. The changes will continue!
this movie.....THIS SUCKS ON ICE
The council of red gandalfs
cow334 u.u
cow334 it gets better, trust me, also, if you dont like it, don't watch
cow334 why do you think I'm not watching it?
Fl00t4hSh41, I'm not sure if I said anything to relate to anything about orbiting...
Katalenic: what...
Luggage wants to see the world.
How many people here have acctually read the discworld novels?
Vash: never said it sucks its just really long
Every single one.
Tell em Cohan
cow334 nothing u.u
i like the turtle
What is best in life? That is hard, to say~
I remember friends reading them. But never read them myself.
Socks i read mort and the hogfather
Canadian_Brony: good idea
A fresh 'orse.
Are they good?
Ninjazz: Simple thing is they didn't go fast enough to catch fire from reentry
conan references everywhere
Ninjazz: also the spell likely protected them
Katalenic: i like the turtle
alexxm Mort is one of my fave's :)
cohen
brb
Aww comeon, it was a joke :( Sowy.. it's because I saw an MLP meme about it, u were supposed to say "No"
cow334 I popped the chat and opened up a game of Poker Night at the Inventory on my PC with Borderlands 2 on the side.
cohen gets the heroic sound track, no matter what he does
Fl00t4hSh41, ...alright then. Still don't know if I said anything relating to orbiting and falling.
Yeah go Borderlands 2
Hot water, good dentisty and soft lavatory paper. These are the greatest of things.
Dat Nife.
is it cohen, conan, or cowen the barbarian?
Oh, so its hit the halfway mark?
Dat Jmo
how long this movie is @_@
Meanwhile: I'm kinda with Cohen about that these days.
:P
Finised a pic :3
Vash, Cohen I think
hi Jake
GAH
Meanwhile: they are certainly nice things you don't miss til you don't have them
hi Jmo
Was watching, tssk.
Kencolt: Probably because you have the same beard.
uh hi
Meanwhile: No beard here.
Damn freaking wizard pw3rz
Kencolt: Fair enough, hey are you drinking buddies with Death?
wow i never before rushed to the keyboard like this
He sounds like a lich.
what year did this movie come out?
What's his name... that necromancer from Warcraft 3?
Socks: he was also Count Dooku
Da fuck is this I'm watching?
Aye.
Meanwhile: I'm probably closer to meeting him than you are, if that's any answer.
CaesarAugustus, the color of magic
Ninjazz: Khel' Thuzad
Kelthu-yeah.
Ninjazz: or sth like that:$
Him. Voice filter makes him sound like a lich.
Kencolt: The joke was that you're both the same age, but sure I'll take it.
That Death is a friendly and helpful chap.
SirGanjalf, I think you got it right the first time.
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Both Jetpack Comics Fluttershy Varient and Collab with Larrys Comics now Available for Pre-order

2,14 Masque of the Red Death
woha 4 hours and still running
Ann: Yep, that's the Discworld Death, allright
2,14 an allusion to that poem
2,14 classy
Socks: just remembered the voice lol
I said those Fl00t
If I ever find my e-reader I'm gonna have to read the actual books.
why does death keep going after rinsewind if he can can the future, doesn't he know he won't be succesful?
did he said he'll be taking off his mask at midnight?
can see*
Ooork.
Nnnyeeees.
OOK?
Death can't see the future, he just works out whose going to die when using maths
why is he an ape anyway?
"ook"
Vash: Rincewind kind of... breaks all rules.
Mmmmyes mmbananas...
Ninjazz: Googled it; it's Kel'thuzad - closeenough.jpg
was it the octavo?
The ape is the librarian
Because they couldn't find a duck capable of managing a library.
3 chapter left and the next one is the longest of them all....
Ann :D
He was in the way of the "ChangeWorld"spell
SirGanjalf, like I said, right the first time. Just off by a space bar.
ook?
Vash: A wild spell turned the librarian into a monkey, but he can stil ldo his job just fine
mmmmmbanana?
XD Sirganjalf
Oh Tim is perfect as the Archbishop.
and they can't switch him back?
SirGanjalf yes mmmmmbanana
he always play a good villain
makes you love to hate him and lynch him
Archchancellor
He's just a sweet transvestite
Vash, more that he doesn't want to be changed back :P
...............
Vash: Why bother, now its easier for him to reach those high books.
tim schafer looks like eddie izzard, doesn't he
knew it
lol
Vash: Actually, he won't let them. He decided he LIKED being an orangutan, since all he had to worry about was books and bananas.
*super squee*
Vash: He feels pretty good as a Orangutan in later books IIRC
Vash: Its just one of the occupational hazzards of working with magic in the discworld
well i guess the ape thing makes since
*?*

Invi: Holla! :)
Luggage is the Element of Loyalty.
they are going to scarafice her. ;A;
How did they do the picture box imp in this? I missed part 1
Luggage is best Spike.
Meanwhile :D
Luggage is not spike
Socks, it is from another continent of the world i guess
unless they going to scarafice her virginity
You're right. He's the replacement Spike.
It kills, devours people, breaks things and does tons of property damage everywhere it goes
Twoflower is way too positive, can we kill him please?
Ish: Naah i was wrong, he's not in the cast, at least according to imdb:(
And its mean as hell to boot
*turns on record player*

Colour of magic, discworld

Splinters bark and woodlice everywhere...
Bye Coldays :)
Trolls have gotten an aweful lot smaller since the early days of the disc
now that would be a cool boss monster in a game
Meanwhile: Yeah, they are bloody pests
Celestia`s_Bunny: It's really a bunch of stories parodying various works of fantasy fiction, tied together with a "tourist in a strange land" narrative.
Eli: reminds me of Shadow of the Colossus...
LordDerpington: oh
Gargoyle?
Popping in to share this http://fav.me/d5igs5p
Petrified_Discord: Troll
SirGanjalf: Troll/gargoyle hybrid maybe
Trolls turn to stone in the sun.
As one can tell, the censors dubbed Idiots over the original "Bastards".
Petrified_Discord: Nope, just troll
Mephone4: were nearing the end. fluttershy: *breathes in heavily*!!!!!!!!!!!! ʸᵃʸ
It's a Hobbit ref i think(if not a folklore ref in general)
Since when do trolls turn to stone in the sun? :|
Meanwhile: Retconed in latter discworld books but true in the first one
since... ever...
since Hobbit
Petrified_Discord, The Hobbit
Petrified_Discord: that's pretty normal
Fl00t4hSh41: Well, he was a VERY old troll.
Petrified_Discord in norgiwen mythologly
i saw Twilights cuty mark
Petrified_Discord: Since old norse mythology about trolls
same
just without the 6 stars around her cutie mark
Huh. Cool.
Kencolt: True
oooooook...
anybody else not seeing anything on stream?
I guess wizards are orangutangs deep down.

Invi: actually just look at the movie even
As a whole*
Gundamnit Invi.
why do I suddenly get so much buffering?
Invi: you can see it even in there
Oh, well of course not :P
He says in good humor
Ninjazz, what have gundams to do with that? ^^
Lil_B: Because something is happening
Hello everypony!
Why is this movie so long again?
Lil_B: Because the world is coming to an end
DerpyMuffins: hell knows
this movie will end when airsoft is legal in Australia
Because it's a miniseries consisting of two 90 minute movies
Invi, because mecha suits are awesome.
Twofloooooweeeeer Jeeeeenkiiiiiins

Pokemon Dream World is a feature where you can connect your Pokemon Black/White game to the internet and pretty much collect berries, get Pokemon for free, stuff like that.
Please don't imitate people.
SpadeMagnes[R]: Well I guess that explains the track design in this game
flyingace11: dont overdo it tho, shyness is still better than douchiness
Always and forever
I recommend it if you don't have another DS to get Pokemon from other generations.
