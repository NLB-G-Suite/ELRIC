this is beyond sexual content
From totally unsupported fanon?
well she's still a gentle monarch. nota tyrant
i hear a PS1..
Those points are totally invalid due to her governing style though
or is ps2
I don't mean a tryant just... I don't know the word.
Dictator?
yeah PS2
oh i haven't seen the old ps2 opening in age
Anyway..
^
but she can't be since she probably has a government under her to take some of the workload off
that and Luna
Yeah
Well, no, it might indicate or hint at a possible government, btu she probably has all power if it comes to it
Dat kick .-.
hm...
2,14 don't post things like that again
yes yes
Yeah, Luna and Celestia do really well as a governing power
won't happen again
even if we don't get to see all the things they actually do
luna is the center of this holiday
no
never
me neither
^
I have, but only briefly
is this...
yes, i think it is
yes it is
And they're HUUUUUUGE
i must play this
actually have a copy but its ntsc and my ps2 is pal
hmhm
REALLY anoyed me when it got here and would not work
Stupid regional locks
Overthinking cartoons for children ahoy
I disagree with that TRK
^
Nature is seen as unatural- it's just the way in Equestria, it might actually BE unatural, we don't know
As for the sun and moon, apparently this has always been done, before Luna and Celestia took controll, the unicorn kingdom did it themselves,
i have the thought that weather manipulation is a way to control various wild beasts, such as wendigoes in Hearths Warming Eve
Could be, most likely it is because, for some reason, in Equestria, and their world, weather does not change withou the aid of magic
Could be-
Hm, yeah
the other problem isnt just the everfree
Did we get to know anything about it?
i am pretty sure the buffalo do NOT have weather manipulation techniques, though i COULD be wrong
Yeah, they fear the nature of it because it is different. But they fear the beasts because they're dangerous
Honestly, the only knowledge we have on everfree history iss...tidbits from episodes
but it don't seem to have changed since Granny Smith was young
in a fully built castle
don't make it angry
bad idea
it could be 1000 years or 5000 years
chaaaarge!
Most speculate that it is around the time Luna was banished, but --hard to say when they settled there with a castle- but minimum 1000 years
bite its foot off!
ya I agree a minimum of 1000 years
kill the daft wee beastie
Or bottom line, it was just a spooky place for the children to enjoy.
We don't know how long ago..hearths warming eve portrayed, if we did, we could probably guess when, ca, they came into power
It might have been alicorn attempt at creating a self sustainable natural environment- but I don't think it was made as a spooky-fun-place
poor creature :(
next time bring a grenade launcher
Probaly
but that's the FUN part

Thats how a real book should be
You should read the rules page.

but
there are links
Saturn: Some Color of magic, to be precise
o
*they
ok
Saturn: do you like the DiscWorld series? :)
derp
oh
Rather than mentioning the rule over and over again in here maybe someone should just link him the rules.

He... looks familier.
anyway, I'm afk now :)

/me 08,01was never very interested in reading novels until he read Discworld
08,01MadSurge: i read all of them by the time i was 16
is it just me or does this movie seem to be skipping forward? is my stream just being weird?
:D
awesome

but really, me too
08,01MadSurge: fucking fantastic
08,01everything LotR should have been
Saturn: added to my list then :D
08,01but wasn't, because LotR is about as interesting to read as a shopping list
08,01John Major's shopping list.
08,01yes, in my opinion
I like reading shopping lists though
I despise lord of the rings though
I don't like the Hobbit

I can't read LoTR. Too long and drones me out.
08,01Caramel: it's undoubtedly an influential book, it's just not to my taste
I read it when I was 14!
Only LOTR book I read
Saturn: what's the main difference?
Reading LoTR is very slow going. Good books though.
