He's still got a point.
You don't recognize me?
The mane chat used to be really fun and stuff, but I've just grown really tired of it now.
Which is a shame.
Scoot-Scootaloo: well as long as you dont put the endurance Pmv then we are good :)
But yeah, mane is usually boring and/or stupid.
Yeah, I recognise you.
00,03You guys do know I'm all about the moodswings, eh?
I don't know anybody <:
Except the Skype people
00,03And nope! I have a special stream today...
Oooh!
It was okay earlier when we had Shizu explain the -byte system.
:o
I learned!
Anyway this isnt my cup of tea.
Scoot-Scootaloo: Story?
Mane chat's been declining for a long time, but nowadays it seems to be dragging the bottom of the barrel.
can't wait to see it Scoot's :)
me neither but fluttershy
Once it hits rock bottom it can't get much worse, right?
Hey guys

YAY THE NEW EDDSWORLD SHORT =D
:D
haha
OH MY GOOOOOD!
Because I was about to suggest that, as soon as mane dies, we should swoop in and reclaim its dead, diseased body, purify it in flame, and possess it.
Probably not. But it can cause comas.

Oh my god my editing notes are longer than the document itself.
Hiiiiiii, giiiiiiirls!
um wrong episode
she learns shes a mental trainwreak
Seriously, my description of "what you did wrong" is longer than the text that is wrong.
I'm a whovian
And that wasn't Lesson Zero.
silverturtle82: me too :)
That's meta levels of wrongitude.
not being social for long periods of time more then likely leads to insanity
silverturtle82: Smith or Tennant ?
Fluttershy is the leading cause of diabetus
Pretty much!
She was talking about It's About Time
more like social disability
now that I've watched all the episodes I kind of like tennant more
Brb getting icecream
is the same one that did "a few mere hours ago" ?
Yes.
Back in 15 minutes
Yes it is.
cachi01|phone: again ?
Me too!
silverturtle82: Have you watched any pre-2005 Doctor Who?

It is five pages long, and under two thousand words.

"“It is useless to hide anything from me. I feel everything you feel Luna. Both emotionally and physically only intensified. That’s what broke the seals that freed me in the first place. Your lust for the lavender mare. Your love for her. Your desire to be in bed with her and having your way.”"
That's Nightmare Moon speaking.
O_O
:D
"Luna blushed immensely after hearing the last one. Did she really love Twilight? Nightmare Moon may have been a monster, but she had some valid points. Deep down she did lust for her, to love her, and to have her way in bed."
guess what...
Sumica i see what you did there to the script :P
what cutting short?
And then that
Sumica: what just happened?
Pudge: You eat to much fudge?

silverturtle82: It wasn't cut short. They only ordered 13 new episodes for season 3.
some how when derpy got dissed and removed we actually fought back with words and not actions
Reikim|Preread i'm sorry but if you accept to pre read this you deserve that suffering
Not_A_Moderator: a greater sign, then a bunch of sashes, then an 8
yes and there have NEVER been any retarded cartoon characters
guys incase your wondering, Sumica edited the kick script to autpo kick you if you mention the title of today's A movie :P
I didn't know it was this bad!
nope...
Not_A_Moderator: or is that a lesser sign, idk
Love and tolerate!

gotta love that +J channel mode
100kb/s makes me happy~
S
prevents you from auto rejoining when your kicked
Fight Club
Unfortunately that's still a ten-hour download.
accepting people would probably be quiter harder to notice
Not_A_Moderator: I didn't know "one letter left" was a letter.
:D
......
/me is getting 400 kb/s
who is streaming o.o
Adam West's Thong.
Do NOT make me smack you.
Gunthler: :S
Shizuka: but only some people can stream
Tbh I want someone to stream it first just to see that.
Everypony say Fig ht Club at the same time for a mass kick
Klumzeedragon: ah
Pudge: NO.
I'm sure one of the other mods will try to stream it.
:P
Scoot Scootaloo: 10000000000000000 POINTS YOU WIN!!!
wait, so if I say fight club, I'm getting kicked?
Pudge: a kick that big, might actually alert the sysops
They might even do it just to spite Shizu.
ah, ok then
Pudge: i got a perfect historie of 0 kikc,im not going to ruin it today :|
Not_A_Moderator: Win what?
so by Wednesday i should know if they approved the brony club :$
Derpy_Hooves: it will be a glorious day
no thank u
I would like to see that fiasco
Spazturtle: First movie is Fight Clube, the second is The Day After Tomorrow
we rock!
Either way, the reaction'd be the only worthwhile thing in that stream.
but what if im not awesome? what do i do?
Yay we rock!
00,03Here it comes...
Thanks, AlioopsTER! :)
who are they interviewing?
i don't rock :(
Thanks Ali's :)

BONUS
Pudge: actually i kick that big, might result in an a-kill D:

LOk

When I leave, I might not be back until the day after tomorrow
'e.lf,ec;',f

who are they interviewing?
Not_A_Moderator: FOREVER!
Reikim|Preread http://i48.tinypic.com/2n0u1vr.png

00,03See the top of stream
OohShiny: Alioopster.
Pudge: Alioppster
ah
Oh look, as soon as I try to open that, my connection becomes otakon's.
Pudge: actually i kick that big, might result in an a-kill D:

:)
...*five hours later...FUUUUUUUUU *a few days later* UUUUCK
I couldn't imagine watching a My Little Dashie movie.

I really should invest in a couple carrier pidgeons.
pony_1757: Read top of stream.
Pudge: a.k.a ponychat ban
Derpy_Hooves: yeah i know
00,03>/////<
lol
Not_A_Moderator: Did you take breaks inbetween?
So, what now?
i would love to try out but i can't voice for shit. would love to do art, but i suck at art. would love to make music, but i suck at that as well. Least with C++ i can make a game
All our internets will implode
nope...
Sequel? I think it's okay by itself.
Scoot-Scootaloo, you should do background pony :>
Scoot-Scootaloo: She totally thinks you're MLG. ;)
go smack your ISP Reikim
And it's really, really sad when your up speed is higher than your down speed.
Back form afk. what's up? i hear voices... i mean, more than usual
awesome interview :)
AJIsAwesome: My Little Dashie 2: He Gets A New Pony Daughter

Final_Boss_Desco: never talk about you know what

i get the feeling this is the beginning of the club
Even if it means I have to make a crapton of change.
falcon pawnch!!
Yes, you must hit me.
PAAAAAAAAAAAWNCH
or not
left hook
00,10did he just ear punch him?
FALCON PWANCH
FALCON PAAWWNCH
Dark92Enigma: Great, now I have that music playing in my head.
NORTON PAWNCH
Fight!
Worst punch ever!
you asked for that
in the ear
Dark92Enigma: Thanks. >_<
lol.
wimping punch
lol
wat? :o
GUT
00,03Dat punch...
wimpy*
that was adlibbed
Discombobulate
fun fact: brad pitt didnt know he was aiming for the ear
But then, when you work five and a half hours with one break, just about anything will amuse you.
Sumica I think he . . . he did. I would've aimed for the neck.
Ear Punch is the moost painful punch.
Fun Fact: That punch was entirely unscripted, Brad Pitt expected Edward Norton to hit him in the shoulder, the reaction was entirely real.
Should've asked whether he would punch back. XD
WOAH PUNCH
love this soundtrack
Scoot-Scootaloo it was weak
beat that ear like a drum
GO FOR THE JUGULAR
magmablock: dat sir, is a fucking good soundtrack
yay
Edward Norton saying 'I fucked it up man' was in reference to the take.
00,10criple fight!
:[
Ah, now here we go.
:P
BY THE WAY, now i remember THIS IS THE MOVIE WHERE THE ''PENIS SCENE'' CAME FROM!
dustbrothers <3

well, maybe not, but you got my point
Wrek and Scoot-Scootaloo: To be fair, the film does have some fairly blatant homoerotic overtones.
This movie is not what I thought it'd be like.
Oh come on stream, don't turn into a slideshow for me
Scoot gets a killjoy medal?

Sumica: well if there are no wires conencting to the water, i dont think it matters
Eye for an eye and all that.

ohai Patricia
Canadian_Brony: Mayor League Gamer......but close enough
Fight your boss
Wish I could do that with my boss.
Sumica: why, the switch isnt meant to be a conductor. and if it conducts, itll hit him without water too
hi Patricia
Bloody shirt
But Saxy, what about us HLG people?
Explain dis.
Dats a tiny tub.
Er, mute him, I mean.
I think the chat froze on my end. I might have to refresh
DashWithRainbows what be that?
NOTICE THESE DETAILS they become interesting later
0,14have no idea what HLG means
I'm pretty sure he'd kick my ass.
Okay.
00,10if he was't leg deap in water he would probably have shoes on to block the current
Important to keep smoking at all times, even in the tub.
SaxyPretender: Higher League Gamer? :P
Ahem.
hey whos streeming the movie
Yar.
muffin button
00,10and it's a breaker switch, it has all the power flow
swag
SWAG
Dat swag.
Fight Swag
therainbowvortex: Sumi as usual
This is one of the gayest movies ever made.
Sumica: Movie logics.
This guy is nuts fights everyday, lives in a crappy house, and hears fluttershy all the time
Does not matter, fangirls love a guy who is crazy, at least that's what I learned from tumblr.
whatc out for troll
hey, doesnt ghosties hate the word swag?
SaxyPretender Hidden League Gaming. I used to do it a lot in Halo 3, you gain the lead and use hiding spots and wait until the game has ended. The best part is getting the opposite team to join party chat and lie to them where you are and that you can see them.
It was fun as hell
I could summon you a muffin.
DocSane: How is this movie homosexual?
yay
04Yes
then kids found out about it.
It may not like you though.
Ruined it so much for me,.
dat girl
DING
ping
dingadingading
But Phase...I didn't install a muffin button...
AJIsAwesome: How are you not spotting the blatant homoerotic overtones.
dundundundun
AJIsAwesome: It's a love story between two men.
0,5d-d-d-d-ding
Sumica: doesnt matter afaik, he still has 0 potential, while the switch, if it actually conducted, would have a non-zero potential, so i think it would hit him anyway. rubber boots dont stop getting hit by electric fences, for example
cowvarkian: It think YOLO is worse.
0,14HLG are true pros
What the? I thought she was ded.
It's a major part of the film.
There is no muffin button...
hah
damn
cool teeth
why the pings?

:D
kool aid
You hear dat Scoot-Scootaloo? Us HLG guys are professionals :3
Oh my, what happen to your teeth.

00,03Damn right, son!

Reikim, have you got the dlc for dx:hr?

The first rule of Bronystate, you don't talk about the first rule

No.
Actually, wasn't even aware there was any.

The Rules of the Internet were preceded by the Rules of Usenet which were preceded by the novel/movie.

OohShiny: clight flub?

I might do that about now
So, this if WWE if it was interesting and not staged.
Wrek topless sweaty guys having loads of physical fight club?

OohShiny: AND he beat the shit of a guy Like A BOSS
fights=money
Hell, there are a lot of games lying around that I've only half-completed.

05you know it DashWithRainbows
DashWithRainbows: I would pay to see that
BRB, I need SNACKS

Hemmingway would be a brutal fight.

NICE :D
Actually I might go play Bayonetta for a while. I think I'm close to beating that one.
SHATNER!?
Shatner would win.
lol dat plot.
:D
i plan to finish them all before next year
if i could fight any celeb: brad pit
There are game I have that I never played.

It is a fun game.
"Self-improvement is mastrubation."
GET TO IT SAXY
SirGanjalf: dat could be a fun rule :D
thats who i fight
NOW
wow
/me Perhaps, dear boy, if i exaggerate a little bit more, my acting will become a little more like Shatner
Reikim, people complain about the end, and tbh it has problems, but thats because its compared to the rest of the game
0,14but no money
Loud roaring.
CrimsonPhoenix that is a little mean
Oh, my................. :O
this is kinda depressing
0,14it's all beng saved up for Halo 4 or maybe NYCC
Phase4: End of what?
like portal vs portal 2. the latter has to be compared to the former
Reikim, dx:hr
Looks like Muttinchops gets in on the action
AlienWarhead, no it ain't G3 ponies are nothing
So out of stupid curiosity, how long is this movie again?
Ah
SaxyPretender: Yarr harr?
Good game overall though
Anyway
MrBen: 15 hours
the final conversation is quite awesome
9000 hours
lol how is it that nobody hears them?
0,14nah, I don't raisethe Jolly Roger
It was clearly about beating the crap out of each other.
Sheeeeesh
Wirisme: Oh, you ain't seen nothing yet.
You could probably find Bayonetta for like 15 bucks now.
IT'S OVER 1006 HOURS
And I like that :).
1 HUNDRED MILLION HOURS
You know what, never mind.
no 9001 hours
all the violence
welcome to a site dedicated to colorful ponies who like friendship!
I somehow think it's 3 hours but I may be wrong
Bjornfot, Fiddle de de
Because they're underneath of a bar that's "closed".
Basically beat the crap out of everyone.
0,14true...
dat blood
MrBen: we obviously dont know
NO......OVER 9000! gah
twilight_sprinkle: ikr
I thought he lost his eye for a second.
The action in Bayonetta is smooth and fluid. The controls are fun and classic. The combo system is simple but allows for variety in your action. And the weapons are awesome.
What movie is this'
THAT is Blood, bro
I'll just look it up myself, then.
0,14I've played it
Dat foreshadowing.
Also you play as one very hot witch.

Romney just doesn't have the support base to compete. The democrats is nowhere near as splintered or full of in-fighting as the republicans atm

All you have to do is take a cup of flour!Add it to the mix!
omg
and Pinkamena's Promise...
lol why did you kiss my hand.
i think this is like pinkamena stuff like this
Dunno, I read an article saying he might actually have a shot at winning.
I just saw woods
He just wants to play a game
think about penguins
i bet i'm not the only one moving is hand uncomfortably
premature elightenment?
Partly because of the old saying "change is good". People seem to be naturally wired to vote for something new.
WTF?!?!?
This guy is even crazier than the girl.
This is your pain, this is your pain on drugs
lol think about the penguins.
these people are fucked

Slideshowagain
_|\ giggle at the ghostie _|\
Reikim: if that were true (the change thing) then incumbents wouldn't win nearly as often.
This movie is about trying to find sense in a morally collapsing world.
Yep, this guy's a psycho.
God loves us he made ponies
True enough.
So be it!
Does it sound bad that I think he would make a good cult leader?
Save an absolute disaster from Obama's campaign, he's gonna win.
In this election, though, it is apparently in full force.
MY MIND IS SEXUALLY HARASSING ME! HELP ME!
this guy is freakin' sane
AlienWarhead: implying there is a god
he mad
AlienWarhead lol
I think he is a cult leader.
That's my bet too.
Psychopat who knows chemistry = bad combination
DocSane, that speech about God indicates that this guy is part of the moral collapse.
He'd be great at it.
Brad Pitt IS Osama Bin Laden!
ow
Partly because if it isn't I will have to endure up to three different tirades from three different friends.
Malk: I wouldn't be surprised if Manson was sort of like this.
Kandarihu: Yep.
Dats acid.
04Soooo...the lesson here is that once you finally get a scar on your hand you're god incarnate?
ouch
that looked like it hurted
DocSane: seems more like its demonstrating the collapse itself rather than looking for any sense
The environment they're both rebelling against isn't moral collapse. It's civility.

Ghosties somethin' like that I guess

Congrats, you have now passed the test.

YAY!
Dark92Enigma: What plot twist? You have not even begun to see plot twists.

He ded. Wait. No. He not.

Never mind.
The Internet.

Gnight everypony

They all lived.
"A near-life experience?"
04Damn this is a long movie
twilight_sprinkle: Either you or someone else said way earlier 'TYLER BLEW UP THE CONDO' or something along the lines of it.
Night Michael!
Goodnight Michael
Nifht Michael!

"New life experience" I believe
Ghosties: Good movie though.

What the? Jiggsaw what are you doing?
Still has that acid burn
p4ngya high horse:|

0,14says Reikim
Stop playing games, Jigsaw
har har
Jigsaw GTFO
yea i still don't understand the gibberish tyler spouts on this part
Hey
GONNA BUY ME SOME BRAKE ROTORS NAO :D
ScootaChicken: well, before beinga dick, try actually putting some effort into accusing someone of something
04But I don't feel like there's a sense of closure yet
0,14who has the Canadian equivalent of otanet
Even though it wasn't a twist? I ask you. At what point in the movie is it okay to mention that Tyler blew up his condo?
Jigsaw, these games are not funny.
Dark92Enigma: Keep watching.
Dovah: its 139 minutes
My connection's picked up!
ScootaChicken: i didnt say anything of the sort.
04I feel like we haven't come close to any kind of resolution
DocSane: As Megaman X said: WHAT AM I FIGHTING FOR
0,14so onto Carrier Hawks?
DocSane: I'll do
yay~
Ghosties: I think so too
for the war
tyler ran off
I don't feel like there's a reason for most of the film yet.
That was zero
not x
Presumably Reikim's internet is powered by moose.
And then he was gone.
tyler: lol jk
Same here.
oh shit
Ghosties: Don't worry; it comes together.
inkBot: dAMN MY MEMORY
My god
twilight_sprinkle: Was probably someone else then.
DocSane, isn't that Zero?
Hey it's the Haunted Mansion/Phantom Manor from Disneyland
Ghosties: Its not quite over. :) In the end though, everything comes together.
The implications of all those liscenses
it's not over yet
making bombs?
Oh my god, human sacrifices!
dat cult
welcome to prison
Moose are nice chaps for the most part.
twilight_sprinkle: How was I being a dick?
They're hell on a car, though.
inkBot: i haven't played it for 3 years i guess
WAR
We are approaching the end of act 2, kids.
ScootaChicken: you basically called me stupid.
Now it's a prison.
The cult of discord has risen
Space monkeys :)

Kurra does it involve project mayhem?
fluttershy card
He still is in weird way.
GTFO
/me WHEN I KILLED YOUR BROTHER, I LOOKED...........JUST. LIKE. THIIIIIIIIIIIIIS!
but I will say that there were crafty solutions to the demands the imaginations placed upon the visualization of this movie.
why not say: Where is Tyler.
ScootaChicken: no, its being a dick. youre not even apologizing. and whoever yelled it couldve been just guessing, and its such an obvious twist theres nothing to spoil even
war, is hel
lol at least they are kind enough to clean the yard.

twilight_sprinkle: It's probably not, this film is a fair bit unrealistic.
o.o
he's losing himself to Tyler Durden
his imagination has a mind of its own
He's crazy.
There's a LOT of artistic license with the psychology in this.
hello everypony
"Stop hitting yourself! Stop hitting yourself!"
Tyler is a fucking psycho
lol
allo Freefall29
whoa
one thing that bugs me is how "tyler" is beating himself up in the lot, and the people ask if they can go next....
totally nuts
HE'S AN ALTER EGO ALL ALONG? and HE WAS TALKING TO HIMSELF? HE WAS FIGHTING TO HIMSELF!!!!!?? AND AND AND AND AND AND................Who wrote this, Dr. Insano?
ScootaChicken: Yeah, this twist is a bit farfetched...
damn. I forgot about fight club
0,5DA FUCK
Two of us are in this room. One of us has to die.
Dark92Enigma: almost
Dark92Enigma: eeyup lol
o_o
no, Youre insane
Dark92En|gma, Chuck Palahniuk
ded
Tyler is Pinkamena, the other guy is Pinkie
his alter ego is alive?
00,10dat lampshadeing
＼(゜ロ＼)
Dark92Enigma: /) dr insanso did, din;t he :)
00,03So... soap was Hobbes?
ded
No your insane.
DERPDERPDERPDERP: The amount of foreshadowing earlier in the film does give it a bit more credibility though.
wha
4th wall break
pony_300 when the guy asked to be next tyler wasn't fighting jack
OohShiny: It all makes sense
:o
nah the audience has pretty much figured it out
I call you back to the scene where he beats himself up in front of his boss: "For some reason, I thought back to my first fight with Tyler"
so true xD
giant: It's an alternate personality struggling for control.
/me smacks Freefall29
lol that's so true we have no idea.
you dont talk about that
Scoot-Scootaloo: Calvin was Hobbes...MAD TV FIGHT CLUB PARODY IDEA!
Scoot-Scootaloo . . . fuck it. Yes. Soap was Hobbes.
insolent fool
THE FUCK
"The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea." Yeah, pretty apt.
inkBot: Who was he fighting?
Oh, I missed the thing where there's the spot on screen that signals a movie operator to put in the next reel of film....
my name is Tyler Durden
RAWRity: That's probably the most obvious ones, but there are quite a few more.
*one
00,10film real change over
BLOOD
oh snap
pony_300 some random dude
BLOOD BLOOD BLOOD
And the movie began with what seemed to be a flash forward of Tyler putting a gun in his mouth. That makes this mindscrew all the more trippy.
sorry all for spilling the beans
ohhhhh okay
ScootaChicken: yup. Like the fact that nobody else ever talked to Tyler.
the moral of the story kids: GET SOME SLEEP
always to him.
deja vu, a glitch?
Bronysith: yeah. but nobody listens to rules 1 and 2 anyways
^
this is what happens when you dont sleep
And yet he revealed it in the first scene. "I knew all this because Tyler knew all this."
Moral of the stories: Don't do drugs.
there's a glitch in the matrix
^
Remeber kids, make sure you always sleep. :S
wait, so the culties know he's tyler?
He was living in his own Matrix.
or is there no cult
RAWRity: Another example is lines like 'Sometimes Tyler answered for me'.
Great. I'm a chronic insomniac who feels like his brain is a seperate person. I'm scared now.
wha
oh bollocks
Hello.
lol AJIsAwesome i need to do that more often :D
wahhhht
Scoot-Scootaloo: "Tyler's words, coming out of my mouth."
shit
I feel like I should try and sleep more often.
hai RosePetal
Dear princess Celestia: today I learned to never stay up for days
ah still "that which shall not be named" nice
Sumica: why did you kick me?
cowvarkian i'd guess it's pretty hard to not notice it if you live with him
members EVERYWHERE
He's in the loop
00,03RAWRity: :O
they're ALL in the loop
inkBot: meh, yeah
yaaay
So now the world goes to hell.
otakon, it's a dumb joke.....
RAWRity: Or when you see Tyler talk to the narrator whilst in the middle of having sex with Marla, she keeps saying things along the lines of 'Who's there?'
Dat 808 drum is awesome
00,10read the kick message then otakon
Everyone is now crazy.
hi otakon
Sumica fffffffs XD
Marla! We have to stop my alternate personality's plot to start a terrorist attack!
Hoo boy
Kurra: agreed and it's given me goddamn GRIEF ever since I heard of it.
So this epiphany of his has resulted in his being cured of MPD?
Sumica: blast the joke
ohai bonies, what I miss
hi Otakon
lol
:O
HA
Mass Effect has a lot more technical options than its successor
oh shit
I thought bullshit came in rockslides
/me glomps IshSexiestPony
:O
otakon, well, you only have to put up with it one night.
IshSexiestPony: can't say it.
THEY'RE EVERYWHERE
oh crap
Kandarihu: not in the least. It's just that HE is awake atm.
Freefall29 why not?
Kurra: for the last week I've had too
he's a mob?
EVERYWHERE.
wow
so.... fight club
They're everywhere because he's been everywhere.
is he a mob?
he has numbers of multitudes
oh you have? Well that is dumb then.
woah
Clean food
.. why is the food dirty...
It's like invasion of the body snatchers.
No Clam Chowder
o.o
lol
Dr Jeckle and Mr Jackass
OperatorPony, you dont wanna know
They multiply.
well that works
What about... Project Mayhem ?
so nobody can figure out that the hundreds of people with bruises are part of the fight club?
hiya TOY_PON3 what's up mate?
IshSexiestPony: check the newsletter and you'll see why
tyler tied up all loose ends
you cant talk about it
Jeckle and Jerkass... XD
fucking reference
hey otakon
crap, i forgot about that
what did they do to the clam chowder?
dammit PaladinDrakkenwolf, you beat me to it
operatorpony im guessing they where gonna piss in it, like tyler did in the begening of the movie
Piss is a main ingrediant in the Clam Chowder. :P
d3rb: yes I do... is it Human?
Is that Helena Bonham?
twilight_sprinkle: people get hurt all the time
lol
Fight club...... COME AT ME KICK BOT BRO
twilight_sprinkle: They threatened the police commissioner, remember?
IshSexiestPony: it is teh melee organization movie
otakon: yeah but theres hundreds of them
OHH ok haha
pony_1758: ah yes that
Never thought it was piss, actually.
twilight_sprinkle: in a city of 1,000's
00,10much like no one can figure out that saying fightclub gets you kicked
she is his very special pony <3
Innate: pretty sure its semen
alright then, no need to badger the bot
Lol
Sumica: kick yourself

Eli: bc people get fed up of shit and they want to strike back
ORLY

Deep emotional problems? We realized that from the start of this movie.
But wait, does asking about Project Mayhem get you kicked?
DocSane: didnt the police shoot them at some point? i kinda missed a part of that scene
So RAWRity, I'm guessing you like this film then?
00,03Marla=Suzie if you don't already know...
Ersatz nnope
Just deep emotional problems?
how did he fuck her while having breakfast?
That boy needs therapy
0,5my mind is fuck
Ersatz: Kerfuffle Society is a rule
Suddenly she's mature about this.
OohShiny its easy. If its like playing videogames while eating then its easy
emotional problems is an uderstatement
it's in his mind
Oh, of course.
OohShiny: he imagined having breakfast
SHUT UP
/me shuts up :<

Ok ok ok......Idiot

Eli: true
OOOOOOOOOOOOH

WHAT if he's just going crazy and it's all in his midn.
cachi01|phone: the stream must've been quick

CHAOS

RosePetal: that's what is the movie is trying to say.
DISCORD
wut?
Discordin

04OH SHIT
>_> sound like a good plan
night Mea...dammit
Tyler Durden = Discord

Money is debt. Debt is control
RosePetal: Only Tyler's in his mind.
04OH GOD
He's so discorded he's even fighting himself.
Jesus
OH SHIT
otakon: funny example: "ohh Capitalism is sooo bad. stop capitalism!" but hey, would you live under a communist regime?
Well fight club is a pretty long movie......wait I SAID IT O SHI-
Because they want to find out who is responsible for making the bat credit card.
OH NO
o.o
Kreature: O_O
nothing against this ^^
OH GODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

Ho ho ho

RUN!
FUCK
Wow. He covered ALL his bases.
welp, he's fucked
HAHA
ITS A TRICKY TRAP
Eli: We only have the choice of two examples, both that are nearly as bad as the other?
HIS BALLS!
Crazy movie.
violation
HA
OH SHIT
Not da balls!!!
"You're going to help us one way or another, Mr. Anderson."
pony_300: no the debt goes back

Nittany_Discord: My mind if full of wat
oh god!
ra
they're taking his balls
I'm sure credit card companies have no backups>_>
Pe
oh God
Everlasting_Joy: xD Yes.
ScootaChicken2: hard to say. On the one hand, the film's ending is more fitting with the tone, but it's lacking in closure. The novel's ending is more ambiguous, but it offers a better conclusion.
uuuhh its not what you think
so the fight club controls even the police?
wow, so they know their boss is nuts
dem balls
scream!
his army is everywhere
that doesn't look suspicious >_>
AlienWarhead: this was back before networking

He is his worst enemy.

led salad? i hope it doesnt have tomato in it, i hate tomato
walk the otherway
no pants
And then they see he's crazy.
04He just looked at him like "That's our boss, man :D"
DERPDERPDERPDERP: basically: YES. after the second world war these to economies had the greates following, and yeah, we had a choice between the two :P
otakon: I know(sorta) but I'm just wondering how that "new world" tyler created would play out
lead SALAD
just as planned?
Lead salad. :D
*lead
MAD SALAD.
He had to think about it fdor a second
screw pants
RAWRity: Yeah, you're right. To be honest though, most people prefer the film's ending (including Palahniuk).
chaos salad
lead salad?
Freefall29 what are you talking about?
Mostly because it's a fair bit happier.
*yells after him* you forgot your pants ...Sir
And he's still not wearing his pants. I love.
DERPDERPDERPDERP: it's what the cold war was all about
pony_300: no idea really, I don't think it would alter it that much
Tyler Durden is officially Project Mayhem(World)'s Most Wanted
CRAZZYYYYY!
Sad thing is, the problebly either think they just failed a test or that their leader is so good he can beat just about anything. :S
Running without pants. I REGRET NOTHING.
I love it.
Get a ... uh.. uh a LEAD SALAD! YEAH! wait..
01,11Man with no pants wandering around town claiming he's the head of a terrorist organization that plans to destroy five major credit card buildings....
Lead salad - tastes like chaos
ScootaChicken2: oh I know. For me it's sort of even between the two.
XDDD
pony_300: it would play out badly
00,10yeah they call him the flash
his other self is apparently way more capable than he is
slow mo
0,5Its like grand theft auto
a man with a gun and no pants running down the middle of the street

poor bob
Someone set us up the bomb
00,03Hobbes is such a douchebag...
bob is dead, the shot him in the head

Project Mayhem has been nothing but murder

Eli: Oh lol. I'm not sure what we're talking about then, I thought you were saying we had one of two choices.
Scoot-Scootaloo: so it's suddenly Calvin and Hobbes huh?
RIP Meatloaf

Pressing random buttons works in video games, because the worst case scenario will force you to reload from a save file, or start from the beginning.

Crap happens.
Insomnia stops the 2 halfs of the brain from comuncating
Wrek: I like Edward Norton more tbh.
this is pure gold.
I wonder how that will look on camera.
Tyler is Jared's inner demon. The only way Jared can win is to realized that Tyler isn't real.
LOL
Wrek: do you have a thing for self-destructive lunatics?
well that escalated quickly
K_A what? something special?
Wut
K_A, it's been like that since forever and the Wii is only 480p
Wrek: Who knows? >_>

These are like that spongebob episode where patrick beats himsef up :D
Ah. He's about to kill himself.

480p still looks better on component, and like I said, I don't have composite.
Nows its flashforeward.

Ed Norton should have installed antivirus. … /me deletes that.

otakon: Yeah, but if you saw the video feed during the "fight" you saw him being physically dragged across the ground by ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

How egalitarian.
MARLA
The book is also noteworthy for sharing ways of removing basically any fluid in existence from fabric.
*throws self out window* fall 5ft
oh no
AND IM ABOUT TO BREAK
oh no she didnt
marla is dead
And they all work.
Unless it's magic.
AND I'M ABOUT TO BREAK!
Dken2021, CrimsonPhoenix: As I've said, some modern monitors/HTDVs lack component.
MrBen: well the movie did that for theatrics is all
Oh no Marla is ded.
economic uquilibrity will last only as long as people start banding together to take over and create more inequality
*equilibrity
K_A, and they go with HDMI now
Wait she's not ded yet.

DJ_Soru: cachi01|phone no. Linkin Park is banned here.

Hmm
Let me re-check.

Your not real!
Who is the alter ego....?

OperatorPony: yes

Stop hating, I wasn't the only one

Phase4: yes
8 minutes in
Phase4: i like it

neat, show any good?
BaconMane: It does.
it is
Moral of the Story: Be careful on creating your imaginary friends.
v
He warned the police. A happy ending will result in them working their butts off to defuse those bombs.
ohai Phase4
this ending is actually way better than the novels
ScootaChicken2: Shhhh.
BaconMane: Michael Bay would cream himself
think X Files but with young kids
wait, i just read the newsletter. Day After Tomorrow is a B movie?
ohai Shamroc
and gnomes
CG explosions of course
ohai
sitcoms r srs bsns
Dken2021, so far its excelent
he should send him to the fosters home for imaginary friends
lolz that kick
I never wanted this!
Kandarihu: HA. You're acting like this isn't based on a Chuck Palahniuk novel
^
Oh come on, that's barely a spoiler.

Zephyr yeah

RAWRity, I'm not familiar with his writings.
XD
Hey, he just outsmarted himself.
and THEN he realizes it
The Day After Tomorrow should be an A
shoot youyrself
The condo world watching ponies >> blowing up stuff and fighting in clubs
in@ realization
Matrix. :D There is no gun.
oh damn
also reminds me a bit of bobs burgers
going Evangelion style now
Kurra, darn right
FINISH HIM
ultimate "Fuck you" moment of the movie
Fight Club
Gainax would be all over this.
shit just got serious
Canadian_Brony: agreed
Iminite crazy suicide
Awww, he doesn't want to watch the city go boom?
what is the message this movie is trying to get at
Our head.
Ersatz: Ikr?
Kandarihu: think about the fact that he's written al the stuff that's occured before hand. Does he strike you as the happy ending type of guy?
I still wish for that Lullaby movie to progress
Ersatz: inb4 they do an animated remake
Something about consumerism.
now remember kids, suicide is never the answer
He's gonna commit sucicide.
CrimsonPhoenix: maybe one day
Is he summoning his Persona?
And something about the illusion of freedom.
And something about soap.
Ellieme: except when it is
Friends?
aw friendship saves the day! except all the chaos and madness
Freefall29 that you shouldn't talk about fight club?
Dats right no killing yourself. Think of ponies.
do it!

00,10lobotmised
He needed to shoot up more
Nice
HOW DAFUQ IS HE ALIVE?
ded
ouch
What's that smell?
the picture is so dark I can't see it
Double kill
He killed Tylor.
IshSexiestPony: that, and how exactly blowing up credit card buildings will bring about economic freeding.
he missed his brain
... that's why i would never use a gun to the head for suicide
Shooting his cheak
dumb fuck
Frickin' ow.
It's smoke.
ಠ__ಠ
thats the only way to kill your imaginary friend
he didn't aim up
freedom
that was unnecessary
whoa
cachi01|phone: you can survive getting shot in the head
u ded
back of the neck
Ded but they both ded.
cachi01|phone: He shot himself through the cheek, that'll hurt a fuckload, but chances are it won't kill you.
That's one hell of a lobotomy.
Wut
it's over. it's finally over
not the brain
04For a moment, I thought it was gonna turn out that Jack was actually the alter ego and Tyler was the real person
cachi01|phone: he shot himself in a way that the bullet GRAZED his brain
"I'm okay."
OH MY GOD
this was kind of a jigsaw game
HOW IS HE STILL ALIVE
tis but a flesh wound
that gunshot take was done with a rubber head and an air blaster.
what
he shot himself to save the city
it destroyed his ear
he has a giant hole in his head and he's holding a gun. "Are you okay?"
He's fiiiine.
"nothing it's no problem"
:D
I'm all good
00,10he blew his fucking mind
He's alive but barely.
totally SAW game
and blew out the bottom of his chin
He'll walk it off.
it's just a Flesh Wound
The back of his head has been blown open, how is he still talking and moving?!
Sumica . . . nice
otakon i know there was a mexican soccer player who survived a shot to the head :)
Yep, totally fine.
tis but a scrstch
Ghosties: Huh, not a bad idea though....
tis just a flesh wound
DashWithRainbows: ha
it IS a flesh wound
Tis but a scracth.
guess he never actually shot himself?
ignore the whole in my neck
Jawn: The bullet exited without hitting his brain or jugular.
where are they what is going on
Hai Marla :D
yay
Tis' just a gflesh wound
cowvarkian: touche
lol
Oh hai Marla.
*flesh
my face
Ghosties: Throughout the film you can see that Jack slowly changes his performance where he starts behaving a lot more like Tyler, whilst Tyler starts behaving more like Jack did at the beginning.
O.O
he is he still not passed out from shock
Which is pretty kewl.
"Blah blah blah you're a dick-oh my god your face."
how did he survive that?
he shot himself to cure himself
cachi01|phone: there was a construction worker that had a 3 foot section of pipe SKEWER his head and not only he was concious for it, he felt no pain and survived it.
haha
look theres a giant smoking hole in my head
BOB?
I shot myself.
luck
yeah its ok, just a hole in my head
pure goddamn luck
04Fuck yes

I'm Jacks rate of this movie.
Who directed this film?
HIS NAME IS ROBERT/10
Tyler just needed to shot a little sense into himself XD

Absolutely nothing like what I expected.
Im going to watch this movie again tomorrow =D
When I saw this for the first time, I was utterly unspoiled, so the twist took me totally by surprise.
HIS NAME IS ROBERT PAULSON
I love Pixies.
do we have to watch the credits?
shut up/10
night andy
7.5/10. as far as movies go, it wasnt bad, but the philosophy was too simple to actually have any place in the real world
10/10 :)
i would say 9.5/10, but i'm not supposed to talk about it.
bob/10
1 hour until i get black mesa
GilDash: What did I tell you.
I will be generous to rate it 9.75/10 :)
04The ending with the buildings blowing up and "Where Is My Mind" playing is...chills down my arms, man
This part here, the credits? Best part of the whole film.
00,03We needed facts Silverscreen! Like how it's related to Calvin and Hobbes!
silverturtle82 yeah
One of the best movies ever made right here
DocSane, the only way to see it
spacemonkey/10
5/10 I kind of liked it, but everything was far-fetched
ololololololololololo episode one's twist is epic
/me looks for his mind
and that's watching the stream
goodnight peopel :)
I gave it a 7
04Holy fuck this film
ScootaChicken2: I was not disappointed. :)
9/10, some parts I didn't care for but overall it was pretty great.
this was insane
nite MLP_Brovakiin
I'm still not sure what to make of it.
9/10, still one of my favorite films that introduced me to one of the most powerful mindfucks I'd ever seen
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT
04I mean
waaaaaaaaaaaaaat
AlienWarhead: thats the point
I'm glad someone who had been waiting over a year won a movie too. This needs to happen more often.
04It started out slow as hell
Help. I have lost my mind
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAT....
bye MLP_Brovakiin
04And the pacing was really terrible for like the first thirty minutes
and that kids, is How I met Myself
Ghosties: Glad you ended up liking it. You seemed so meeeeeh, about the beggining.
the sex scenes were a little much
It's an honest to God anarchist movie.
guess thats the only way to kill your imaginary friend then
night MLP_Brovakiin
why are we talking about fightclub? we're violating the first 2 rules
waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat....
every ones a cridic
wut
fightclub
04THAT'S WHAT THAT WAS, RAWRITY
this movie really was doing coke or something
05also he didnt shoot his neck off as in where the spine connects to the skull. more like through the jaw otu on the side, missing the main artery
/me jams to end tune.
Scoot-Scootaloo: Well,the only way I could see this related ot that is if this show wasa dark twist to the comic.
this movie is a moden classic
1.1/10, not for any lack of technical execution or artistic merit, but 'cuz it made being mean and fighty look cool. :/
/me missed the sex scenes
oshit, Ghosties.
First time I've seen this, but I went in with spoilers and wow. So many clever details.
I'm okay with thisd
how many have actully played black mesa, not still downloading.
discord's favorites
So BaconMane, glad I forced you to watch that? :{
DocSane: It shows anarchy as a bad thing though, I think.
...screw you Sumica
*:P
Ghosties: yup. The film makes had a lot of fun with this.
04But yeah, once Tyler finally made his onscreen debut like...the film just kept getting better and better
DocSane, I agree. The implications of the ending, I find especially ironic.
This is Grimdark Pinkie Pie the movie.
It grew on me
can I say "fight club" now?
DERPDERPDERPDERP: Which I agree with.
0,5I wasn't forced, and you ruined the ending
thanks for the movie! :)
oh at the end of the credits already? cool
Ghosties: My feelings exactly
i dont know where to get it..
Scoot-Scootaloo: Plus, Hobbes is childish animation. Tyler is just insanity originating from insomnia.
lol nope Innate . but you can say f¡ght club
Where is my mind.
and I didn't spoil the movie! :D
*imagination*
BaconMane: Barely, you can see it coming a mile away.
First rule of fight club is *Buy some apples*
Shamroc interwebs
i give this movie 0/10
04Neat credits outro too
Ghosties: im really surprised you haven't seen it yet
whats the next movie?
DERPDERPDERPDERP: Anarchy is NOT a viable social system.
I wonder if Pinkie would shoot herself to kill her Crazy Self.
DocSane: As should everyone, I'm just saying I don't think it was promoting anarchy.
Ponies time
www.blackmesasource.com
dat kick script.
Those were some short credits.
pony time!
/me slaps himself
oh come on. I didn't even say anything
I'm trying to think of an allusion for this film. I know there must be one, but I can't think of one
OF COURSE
PONI TIME
Applebuck season
and then ponies...
Mood whiplash time. XD
POny time!!
The majority of the film seems fairly pointless when you consider that the only thing that actually mattered throughout the whole film was the main character's state of mind
PONIES :$
I love this episode so much
00,10perhaps later Eli, I have a headacke
The end now time for ponies.
ponies
With a party cannon, OohShiny.
PONIES!
WHY DIDNT I THINK OF THE INTERWEBS
DocSane: Just the opposite, actually.
YUUUP
<_<
yay ponies!
Ghosties: Watch it a second time, the amount of foreshadowing you can pick up on is ridiculous.
Ponies!

Silverscreen: Well you missed the build up of the relationship between the main character (for some reason I don't remember his name), and Tyler.
And pony just sliiiiides up from the bottom of the screen...
She can do it with the magic of friendship

NICE
okay look the movie is over, joke is old

Dari: We're never given the narrator's name. Not in the book either. Closest hint we're given is "Jack" and even that's suspect.
Snake skin! Snake skin!
Can I say fight club now?
GilDash: He was.

Pony is small
Hello/Goodbye Winnona, as this is the only episode of season one you were in.
I'm still putting the entire film together
Pinkie Pie is the element of Chaos
Reikim: from what
Heya everypony.
yay for random flags
SirGanjalf: No, I know what you mean. As the narrator he doesn't have a name though, so it's hard to say whether his real name is Tyler or that's just his other personality's own name.
ello PaladinDrakkenwolf
hi Pale_Horse
Mozdoc: but she shows up twice in S2
dat apple flag
AjIsAwesome i would enjoy the show also lol
MOOO

Dken2021: hai
twilight_sprinkle: Basically, the insomnia was important, because whenever the Narrator's character was asleep, the Tyler persona took over.
no
don't ya know
unfortunately, I won't be here for Euro Movie Night due to volunteer training
Internet shenanigans.
cows are swiss, yah
Probably the one plothole is that Tyler gave him all kinds of knowledge, such as how to make soaps or bombs.
well hey to you too PaladinDrakkenwolf
HELP MY PSYCHOSIS IS TRYING TO SEXUALLY HARASS ME! IS SEASON 3 OUT YET?!
Where do the cows LIVE?
steer clear. Oh the puns
i wonder why they have never made an issue of cows being stupid and a bit 'backwards' in mlp... they make such a fuss out of buffalos and derpy
implying cows/sheep are inferior creatures
Dat pun
kidzrul434 no
dat pun
:P
kidzrul434: It's out when it is.
Er, soap
Sort of overslept. But at least there's more pony. :)

Well, the MLP Wikia has the title of the Season 3 premier, but not the premier date.
About two kb/s
I had some cider not too long ago that was appletastic
inb4 she's late
A party? Pinkie, that's always your suggestion? :D
flutterfan: wut?
boo
flutterchu: she, isnt...
Reikim: :D
GilDash: Well, judging from his behavior after shooting himself, it doesn't seems like he killed Tyler. It looks that his personality and Tyler were connected again.
AJIsAwesome This site is appletastic
silverturtle82 season 3 SPOILERS are not allowed
But hey, it's climbing!
HELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLP!

Alright, as much as I enjoy the Fight Club theorising and whatnot, it's two thirty in the morning, so I'm off to bed.
GilDash: Atleast i receive it like that.
SirGanjalf: Perhaps. I'd say that instead of being two seperate personalities they merged into one.

Sumi dat kick script is trolling
That's freaky. :S

Pinkie siren <3.
@Eli dude everyone know that the mayor is hot for AJ , did you see the look on her face in that cherry orcherd episode
Rarity :D
wooo
pinkie siren yeah
Kandarihu: She doesn't violate her element. She honestly believes she can do this alone.
then fight club happens
pony_300, no. Just an awesome coincidence
She seemed fine to pinkie ... that means somethings wrong :O
pony_300 did youtube plan this?
woah
>_>Sexy Time?
flutterfan: She's always like that.
I try to avoid using that word in relation to computers.
this is AJ's fight club
DocSane, she's lying to herself.
heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeey sexy lady
fail AJ
flutterfan: I always questioned that about her.
buck them apples
twilight get your ass out of there its none of your buisness
Apple Club
twilight, not the brightest I see
Careful now Applejack. We all have just seen what insomnia may cause.
how long before she starts eeing a Tylerjack?
Unless someone shows me a computer like that other guy's.
why to use the warp?
O_O

Fenr: Perhaps... Big Mac is AJ's Tyler! :O

Applejack meets Jappleack Durden.
somepony has to do an TylorJack image
inb4 need to walk to the zoo
:o
twilight, y u use mana?
Aj remember! That voice inside of you that say you cant is lying pile of shit
Maybe :O
Now Twilight is just showing off. Is teleporting that much really easier than walking? :P
Twilight must've learned from Ganon. :D
walk twilight, you have hoof for what?
@Eli yeah me too, but AJ&Rarity is best ship any way
woops, sorry flutterchu that was a wrong ping :P
Reikim did you have much sexy time with the computer?
First rule of Applebuck Season: You don't talk about Applebuck Season.

CHALLENGE ACCEPTED
Oh AJ, you're so drunk.
I still have yet to name it, but I will, in time.
AJ, y u so sturdy?
stubborn pony
yes yes it is
But Applejack isn't an anarchist like Tyler. She's the one thing that Tyler isn't, and that's a productive member of society.
late
Hey everypony!
How do you stand on that thing RD
this episode is surprisingly easy on the drinks, but those teleports are killer
twilight asking like she "inneocent"

Whenever Applejack sleeps, Jappleack is setting up buck clubs for people to free themselves
00,03Why is she standing like that?

Sumica IKR?
TAADAA!
I see that AJ learned from Pinkie in terms of physics. :D
Applejack developing a second persoanlity and setting up Buck Clubs sounds like an awesome parody idea
Applejack is entertaining you Rainbow! Aren't you entertained? :)
dat stare
RD, just fly
Did she just concede to not being the best athlete?
RD is not amused
Kandarihu: Narrator looked like a productive member of society too.

this wasnt far away...
I respect tara but i dont respect twilight
01,11I'm kinda feeling like Applejack right now. Tired as hell and whatnot.
:D
YEAH!!!
ON
Klumzeedragon: She knocked RD out
WildRepublicGuard: Dark matter
:P
lol
NO
woah what happened to the voice now
FUCK YOU
What would even be in a Pony Zoo???
All I can hear now are horse noise
flutterfan: i don't think there's a "best ship" some better some less. it all matters how you lay out the caracters. but with the mane 6, who have a very defined character, writers have to be carefull. to be honest, i think Rarity is straight
NO I DONT
Argh! That ringing gets right in my ears. >_<
Oh AJ, you crazy redneck.
there are zoos?
why is applejacks only episode too damn good
Twilight should have used some Optimus Prime philosophie on this issue...
there are zoos in equestria
Tyler
Whats in their zoos?
she can do a 90 degree angle turn after a sonic rainboom, but cant redirect after being flown off a seasaw
now that's interesting
twilight_sprinkle she wasn't prepared and was most likely unable to use her wings which would require focus, even for Rainbow
There're zoos in Equestria?
Do pony zoos have humans?
Bronysith: its not her only epside
kelp
duh
OohShiny made up of lesser creatures
gah, Kelp is awful
AjIsAwesome humans
Freefall29: yea it is
DERP 6_9
Canadian_Brony: i would think using wings to them is just like us using legs and arms
she needs Kelp Shakes
kill kelp with fire
Freefall29: the other one is a derpy episode
Slavery is magic
excuuuuuuuuuuuuuuse me princ...oh way,wrong one
The Cakes :).
I seriously hope AJ gets some more episodes. :(
I not a doctor, but it seems that AJ looks bad XD
yeseri bob?
inb4 baked bads
Bronysith: you mean over a barrel
she has like two episodes in all of two seasons togethers, and the rest have like three or more
the torrent is MUCH faster
thank you for the advice
oh man, she so high right now
Dken2021: she has 1 episode
CUPCAKES
They're the same pony! :o
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
SOAP
the other one is about derpy
CHOOOOOOCOOOLAAATE CHIIIIIPSSSSSSS
Its time to get bacon!
and then,they went on to forget this line till A canterlot wedding
She can make anything, even the worst concoction to ever be baked in Ponyville.
Baken? Pinkie, you wanna tell us something>?
no one sees that episode as an applejack episode
AJIsAwesome me too, but Scootaloo needs an episode
Bronysith: that wasnt a derpy episode dude
Good night all! :)
AlienWarhead: True.
0,14^

Night, Ellieme :)

Bronysith: she got a 2 minute cameo
Night Ellieme!
Freefall29: no one remembers it as an applejack episode
i gotta admit, for a cartoon, I kinda actually feel for Applejack's plight. Imagine overworking yourself to the point that you probably haven't slept right for several days
tater chips
she's tripping apples right now
bakin soda
I would eat those. :)
night Elieme
Cya Ellieme
lol
Ellieme: G'night! :)
bye Ellieme
Bronysith: its not a depry. of all ponies. its not a derpy
a cup of sour
twilight_sprinkle point taken. I don't feel like continuing this, so Ima just leave you with this: ponies.
pony_300: Same here in high school.
pony_300, yeah, I sympathise, I've done that rather recently...
It looks delicious
Pinkie just lets this happen...
i like how pinkie doesnt do anything to stop her :D
How could Pinkie not notice this!?
Derpy!
This isnt look good either...
Canadian_Brony: yay ponies :3
*baking muffins...Doesn't use common sense"

YATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATAATATATATAATATATATATA
Spazturtle: Because it's Derpy she's immune to illness
Dken2021: only reason people remember it is because of the idiotic controversy. if it never happened, it be known as a applejack episode
Dken2021: thats the point i am trying to say
AJIsAwesome . . . wait what?
leg wiggle incoming
i think if you stay up too long upside down you die
I don't get it
Mozdoc: If he can eat gemstones, I don't think a couple of worms are going to be a problem
Canadian_Brony: I was making a reference to the cereal.
@Eli well "best __" to me was always you best opinan , and yes rarity is strait as pencil but that dose'nt mean we can't have fun.
facehoof
AJIsAwesome oh
Canadian_Brony: You know, Applejacks?
put two applejacks in a bowl and pour milk HOMEMADE APPLEJACKS!
Freefall29: no, people remember the episode because derpy talked and was canonized
yatatatatatatatatatata
She's only moderately more stubborn then my brother. :D
AJIsAwesome yeah I know
otakon: Wigglw wiggle wiggle yeah
twilight_sprinkle: Nope, but it puts straign on your heart

00,10Clearly AJ's night job is keeping her so tired.
A dead tree on the farm!? The horror...
and buffer on my end
yatatatatatatatatata
Exactly
Bronysith: yeah derpy talked for 2 minutes. its still not a derpy episode.
I'm back........and didn't missed the ending to the A Movie.....but i missed the epic speech
Spazturtle: the blood flowing to the head doesnt kill?
Appols come into mai mouf appols

BABY BUNNIES
And now, its Fluttershy's turn.
And why do you need a bunny census?
flutterfan: true ;) sometimes i get across some Rarity/AJ or RD ships too and i read almost anything
AJIsAwesome: YATATATATATATA
no one sees that episode as an applejack episode
I would try Applejack's cereal if they sold 'em up here.
DocSane: For tax
DocSane taxes
inb4 Lion King reference
Blue team scored. Nun returned
<3
The cereal, not the booze. I don't even drink alcohol
Spazturtle: ah, k, did not know that
AJIsAwesome: I'm back, but i missed the epic speech
I do
DocSane: You need a bunny census because its Fluttershy we're talking about.
bunnies=<timid=<look at angel=>waaait a second...
Dark92Enigma: NOW IS COWARD KILLING TIME!
DocSane: Houses, food, amount of space for those houses, etc.
Derpy just had a cameo
SaxyPretender, SF4, we should play....soon.

OH for celestia's sake
Uh, so here is a question, why is Pinky Pies depressed alter ego known as Pinkamena? isnt that just Pinkie Pies full first name? Its not like Pinky ever stoped being Pinkamena.
Stop it
Derpstar: I bet there were a lot of them over there.
Rex_Mundi: It's nice that you bring that up. I never liked that to begin with.
Rex_Mundi: Just a fanon term, and the fact that depressed Psycho Pinkie is supposed to be, fanon-wise, completely personality different than regular old Pinkie.
Not many today (Friday) but there's a MLP panel tomorrow
00,10it's because people need to label things to reffrence them later
dunno if i wanna see 2nd movie.
04I'm still reeling from Fight Club
Rex_Mundi, perhaps she went by that name when her mane was straight. And when she feels down, her mane also goes straight.
tombstone is best OC
^
flutterchu: indeed
Pretty good eh, Ghosties?
never saw tombstone's OC
?
04Holy shit, was it ever
Whats the slangs
I wouldn't call Pinkamena "psycho" or "crazy", just depressed and lost.
watch*
When she's down or mentally unbalanced, she's straight-maned Pinkamena Diane Pie. When she's happy and fun to be around, she's messy-maned Pinkie Pie.
hi guys is that the Sumica OC pony
But hey, that's my opinion.
Klumzeedragon: well if you do have more important things to take care of, then AJIsAwesome is right it can wait
tomorrow will be the best day of Ghosties life, his breakfast will taste beter than any meal we have ever eatten
Ghosties: Buy a copy so you can see it all over again. :P
so what was crazier, Requiem for a dream or Fight club?
AJIsAwesome: Agreed, but other people just take the idea and run with it.
back :)
just in time!
oh boy
Nittany_Discord, you ready for the insanity?
Dun dun da da
Kandarihu: I dont like that explanation. She is Pinkamena Diane Pie aka Pinkie Pie, no matter her mental state.
MrBen: True, and I can understand that people do that as a joke but some people take it WAY too far. :|
storm incoming!
B Movie Begins
01,11DA-DA-DAAA DA-DA-DA-DAAAA DA-DA-DA-DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA :D
AJIsAwesome: Hence why we have a fanon that, on the general whole, assumes Straight-Hair Pinkie is 180º different than Regular Poofy Pinky.
01,11...C'mon, i'm not the only one who sings it.
-WildRepublicGuard awakens-
AJIsAwesome: Ah. Heh. But, yeah.
this movie <3
damn, I forgot to get the popcorn
*choir singing*
Silverscreen: I sang!
Aaaaand I forget the B movie tonight.
I like this soundtrack
00,10this movie is all about sunday
DADADA
Rex_Mundi, then I guess you can think of it as a line between idealism and realism.
what's this? is that that world fo warcraft movie?
Let's get ready for Earth's destruction.
MADE IT
Oh.
Silverscreen: I oined in person. :D
I like this soundtrack, it's good
Aww shit, this movie is really bad, isn't it?

I don't have popcorn but I do have cheerios
Oh.. yeah this is a B movie..
WELL THERE. TITLE RIGHT THERE, YO.

MrBen: You bring up some valid points. It's nice to meet someone who can actually explain somthing like this.
fight club
Its a funny bad
Sumica: Mind Blown.
Hi all
this was the 2012 movie before 2012
THIS IS IT..................
This movie could use some rifftrax
Hi, XylemTube :)
does this mean bad movie
ice...
00,03It looks like this movie sounds pretty cool!
The movie that proves Al Gore wrong
dash
It didn't get too many good reviews, even if the budget was pretty high.
It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine
ello XylemTube
00,10thought you hate those Kandarihu
lol this movie is so bad it's good.
Scoot-Scootaloo: That pun...
It's just a stupid disaster movie
00,10dohoho Scoot-Scootaloo
It's not that bad at all, not good though either. Then again I don't care for disaster movies anyway.
but whatever
anyone likes the soundtrack as much as me?
I still like TDAT more than Independence Day...
haven't seen it in a while
This movie was okish
ISH
Kandarihu: or some Mystery Pony Theather 6000 <----- Get it?
Wirisme: Stupid good or stupid bad?
WHAT FUCKING MOVIE?!
Sumica, I saw this movie before.
01,11Icebergs. Is this Titanic 2?
oh great
Scoot-Scootaloo: there is something wrong with that grammar, you're lucky Meanwhile isn't here
It's not that bad actually
Dark92Enigma, hehe
Scoot-Scootaloo chill out chicken boy
Silverscreen: :D
BEST MOVIE EVVVVVEEEEERRRRRR!!!!!!!!1
AJIsAwesome: One last point--keep in mind that Party of One has been the ONLY time we have EVER seen Straight Hair Pinkie.
Doctor: THIS FUCKING MOVIE! :)
Day before tomorrow.
I saw this movie when I was in Middle School.
i know what movie i would stream if i were streaming
Silverscreen: no, it's Ice Age 5
00,10titanic 2 electric Scoot-Scootaloo
This is what I'd class an irresposible environmentalism.
04Fluttershy likes the nice score
In my opinion: it's a good movie, just as long as you don't take it too seriously
MrBen: True.
It claims to preach a message I agree with, but in such a stupid way that it damages its own cause.
00,10long movies tonight
NO, it's the LAND BEFORE TIME XXVI!!!!!!!!!
Silverscreen, nope, Titanic the Animated Movie
GUYS WHAT IS THE DAMN MOVIE?! IM FREAKIN OUT OVER HIA
00,10both of them over 2 hours
This scene could use some Pegasai flying about.
imma watch my rifftrax version, steal its jokes and pass it as my own.
HYA
AJIsAwesome: So...yeah. *shrug*
Oh look, it's a thing.
00,10murica!

Did the lottery happen yet?

Wirisme: Tomorrow.
The ozone hole is gonna eat us all!
Better worry
NOAA
I never liked 2012 a lot because this movie is cooler
flutterchu: Why?
Okie
Well I can see the reason this movie exists. Humans are in Antarctica.
This is the Titanic 3. In this movie, the US launches Titanics all over the world. In response, there's a massive ice age. Then iceburgs go and sink the Titanics.
it's....something
the windagos must fave caused all this snow
2012 got slow in the 3rd act.

SirGanjalf SHAAWWWNN!!
Antartica is the land of hatred, because of all the windigoes
Nittany_Discord: Makes sense! :)
Derpy broke the world.
The drilling wouldn't cause the ice cracking.
THEY DUG TOO DEEP!

It would make an awesome Sci-Fi Channel flick.
HOLY FUCK

Where did the icepick come from?
01,11I bet this is Al Gore's favorite film.
The crevases were caused by suicide bomber penguins
AlienWarhead: OH SHIT SON! Thanks.
why is everyone saying it's bad?
that guy cracked Antartica in half
MrBen: iT'S Like he was saying.......''i'm an extra, it's not like if i have to act.......this is gonna affect my curriculum

NC should do a review of it to explain this
wut?
Science!
Arab guy says "what is this… cold?"

lol junk science
lolrepublicans
Whatever. All that the governments of the world need to know is that it doesn't matter whether the Earth is getting extremely hot or extremely cold, but humanity having any standard of living is responsible, so the only way to save the ecosystem is to screw the people.

Well, as much as I'd like to stay and rag on this movie, I gotta run, y'all. Later!
I do it in my head
Silverscreen ever read a Xanth novel?
I think what makes people not like this movie is because it tries to push the whole green agenda too hard
Silverscreen: no
lol
Don't have to waste money on gas.
I want an electric car. I could put my Apple stickers to good use.
I'm still waiting for hydrogen propelled cars...
I do math with my head

It's a F for being cocky.

PaladinDrakkenwolf: yeah for now

flutterchu: A ''green'' car is also refered to as an enviroment-healthy car, or hybrid if you will......the color of the car is green.......there's the joke
Yeah, cuz that happens

04What killed the dinosaurs?
AlienWarhead: .........um..............
04THE ICE AGE!

At least the surf is still good
I'm afraid I am left coldto your pleas of mercy. Now chill, before I turn a cold shoulder.
04Another fun fact, we went through a mini ice age in the 1970's
Thrackerzod: Hubby is cosplaying Shep it was his comment lol
AlienWarhead: i dont remember having physical contact with us untill that chat i just did/am i litterally tearing you apart with just one chat
talking on phones and watching the news: The Movie
Ghosties, it's cyclical.
he gun die
Whoa wait... Palmdale/Lancaster?

We're still in an ice age technically

Instead of a severe thunderstorm warning like proper NWS procedures.
OH SHIT TARA

Is the Tornado talking on the phone too?
GET TO THE BUNKERZ
Now you issue a tornado warning.
WE HAVE TO SAVE HER
U HAVE ANGERED THE TUNDER GOD
VOLDEMORT IS BACK
flutterchu I was joking, it is a reference from "The Room"
Tovler: Yes.
04Also a fun thing to note: on the scale of the Earth timeclock, humans have been around for about 10 seconds or so
OohShiny his name is VVT
OMG IT'S THE F5!!!!!!!!!
AlienWarhead: never seen that
It says "whoooooooooooooooooooooooooooosh."

Los Angeles county has been under a tornado warning before.
.....wait wat
there goes the Hollywood sign
00,10last on I recall is 15 years ago
Red Leader standing by
Fox News reports the weather disaster, brings on pundits who blame gay marriage.
01,11Ghosties: And just look at how f**ked up we made it in such a short amount of time.
noo hollywood!
flutterchu Wow I must have sounded weird:P
>terrible weather
Tara already saved everyone
Quick, let's destroy as many national landmarks as we can!
Oh come on...
0,14Faux News? BWAHAHAH
>send out reporter in a helicopter
HA
The Tornado is asking the other tornadoes to look for its phone. It dropped it
GALACTUS!
HOW STUPID ARE YOU
oh fudge
Someone call Batman!
00,10now for the lets destroy any landmarks we can think of bit
NOT THE HOLLYWOOD SIGN
This is commonplace for Oklahoma City.
Idiots
pewdiepie: WHAT THE FUCK IZ GOING ON HERE!!!!!!!!!!!
Ha ha! Look, Hollywood just played with itself, erasing its own sign.
why is there so many twisters?
04And unless humans manage to find a way to leave the Earth and colonize other planets we're eventually going to die out because of the eventual extremities that will shape Earth
HELP ME SANTA CLAUS
yes
01,11#Yolo hurrdurr
Final Boss
00,10cow
was that gabriel iglasias?
....are those tornadoes roaring?
This cannot happen because LA air can only support 1 twister

so much buffer on my end
Dear god, it's Twister all over again
Ghosties: colonize other planets or become masters of our own
THIS IS HORRIFYING
also, twister + twister does not equal bigger twister
nother cow!

We should take the Earth... and push it, somewhere else!
Scoot-Scootaloo: I like your thinking
hey guys the moon is made out of cheese
The "Son"
Ghosties impossible. A twister that size would only be F2 max. Anything else would have an eye, but it would last a couple seconds maybe. The tornadoes' size and damage do not relate repectively.
/me makes an alternate universe machine and goes to Equestria to ride it out
Oh my god this is The Day after Tomorrow.
*sigh* stupid people
And we have Nitt here for this.

Let's show the weather who's boss.
HEY IM IN THE MOON
RD would solve this in 10 seconds flat
Buts it's a SCIRNTIFIC THEORY!
NO. :C
in 48 hours theyre all gonna be dead
Freaking windigoes

01,11A theory that, for the past 24 hours, has been proven true with one disaster after another. Stupid f**k.
let them all die please
SCIENE IS CLEARLY THE ANSWER HERE
please?
slap
The head of NOAA is trying to protect his budget...from CHENEY!!!!!
Silverscreen that would do nothing. Too much water, not enough salt to dump. We'd have to freeze the water, which is what the climate shift is doing.
20%?
Reikim, First rule of The Day after Tomorrow, you do not talk about The Day after Tomorrow. Second Rule of The Day after Tomorrow, you do not talk aobut The Day after Tomorrow. Third rule of The Day after Tomorrow, you do NOT talk about The Day after Tomorrow!

Bilbo baggens?
That is Bilbo. I didn't realize that until now.
instant freezing does NOT mean it will be perfectly preserved. Even so, that would require tempertures lower than Liquid Nitrogen
The movie has way too much TV and Phone Calls. It needs more googling scenes.
01,11My god, that is Bilbo baggins. Thanks, Ghosties. XD
04Yep, that's Bilbo
Kandarihu: I've only seen the first season so far, but yeah Big Ben. They use British landmarks I assume?
Where is the energy coming from to perpetuate these storms?
Kurra: am i argueing?
Bazbo Biggins
0,14I'm surprised no one's made a "Looks like Mother Nature's going though that time of the month" joke
04Hehe, no prob Silver :P
No weather can hold me down, oh no, I got to keep on mooovin' o/~
military Sumica
AND GOODBYE ROYAL FAMILY
Eye of the Storm
SaxyPretender: But you just did. Hypocrite.
0,14:3
01,11That role is suddenly hilarious.
flutterchu, I dunno, Ijust carpet bombed the channel into nullification?
Mother nature's time of the month isn't an ice age though
Ah! Global Warming!
PonyStationVita hi the ice age is happening
more like volcanos
With awkward air motions that aren't physically possible.
01,11they're f**ked
oh no no the ice age\
DUN DUN
Those are British pilots, of course.
Anypony ever wonder what the guys up in space are thinking?

00,10and we are not to some how belive they are being exposed to the vacume of space
Riiiiight
Welcome to Canada!
aw this movie
Baggins has fooled the Eye of Sauron already. Eye of the storm is nothing for him.
im sorry thats not possible
You crashed into the storm.
^
^^
I feel no emotion or sympathy for any characters in this movie. I just don't care.
don't open that!
Oh I know, I bet it's volcanic ash!
inb4 I WAS FROZEN TODAY
damn
human popsicle
Kandarihu: Yeah, I know. Still, I don't like national landmarks getting destroyed for a lazy emotional response, video games do this all the time too.
now ded
yeah sure
whoah. o.o
mythbusters would call BULLSHIT ON THAT ONE
At that point would they freeze to death?
Screw your internal body heat
lol nope
Derpstar more like Canada welcomes you
I'm mother nature.
But what about the Queen?
I WAS FROZEN TODAY
Mozdoc: wow
He got a chilling reception.
O_O;;;;

How did he find out?
What an ice-cold reunion
Ice to see you
DERPDERPDERPDERP, yeah, I understand.
http://derpy.me/Mtkf7
Pretty sure that's IMPOSSIBLE.
And when did scientists start using F?
DERPDERPDERPDERP: His acting was cold enough
SUCH TERRIBLE PUNS
Oh dem puns
He's so cool
lol nice puns/memes
Thank gawd I dont live in england
This movie is just so full of bull...
We need the internet...NOW!
04Mountain, Gandalf. Mountains!
I can't believe they killed off those characters already....That's just cold.
01,11so many ice puns. It's hardly warm humor there.
00,10but yeah if the froze that fast they should have shattered when they hit
It's a landcane!
fluttershy...
Oh the fuel lines are freezing? I know I'll stick my head out of the door!
DERPDERPDERPDERP: Yeah I remember that used to work on me. Seeing the White House blow up in ID4 freaked me out as a kid but not so much anymore
But you gotta admit, it was done well in Planet of the Apes
00,10so it's a hisacane?
We must go through the mines.... of Moriah!
It's everything!
04I tell you, this is all a nasty plot by the dastardly Mr. Freeze!
terrible wheather
Dark92Enigma: His acting was wooden, almost frozen stiff.
Chat derped, did I miss anything insightful?
Silverscreen you will warm up to the ice jokes
so many terrible puns
It's as though Captain Planet wrote a bad movie...
1st world problems
murricane
DURRICANE
Woldn't make it a DURRicane?

Wonder how many people have been struck by lightning.
Kandarihu: Certainly, it's effective when done well, that's for sure.
YOURICANE. Made just for you. By you.
DocSane: If this movie was made by TED TURNER, then i guess so
04The hobo is one of my favorite characters
0,14I hope to be struck by lightning one day
I'm english and I don't see anything wrong
HurriClub
poor hobo

Man the hobo is great.
c'mon, give a bum a break

DERPDERPDERPDERP, hey, Black Ops 2 ALSO has a New York under attack part, right?
04Probably because he's a Badass Normal
bad news no shit

Dark92Enigma: It's a Fox movie, though.
inb4 hobo is best survivor
SaxyPretender: I suppose it'll come as a shock to everyone if you do.
BULLSHIT.
that much rain with lightning would electrocute the entire city. There will be no power.
BuyToast soon we'll get indigo prophecy
Pureicane, pure filtered winds from the offshores of Miami. Bottled at the source.
0,14Indeed, Reikim

25 feet in seconds? BULLSHIT. Where did the water come from? MARS?
Kandarihu: Yuuup. I saw that on the E3 trailer and groaned.
Nittany_Discord: they dont kill?

It's always sunny in Philly

SaxyPretender: But I don't know if I support you. I mean, I just think you're doing it for the shock value.
They kill.
