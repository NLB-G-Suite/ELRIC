The majority of the film seems fairly pointless when you consider that the only thing that actually mattered throughout the whole film was the main character's state of mind

Hi all
this was the 2012 movie before 2012
THIS IS IT..................
This movie could use some rifftrax
does this mean bad movie
ice...
dash
It didn't get too many good reviews, even if the budget was pretty high.
It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine
It's just a stupid disaster movie
It's not that bad at all, not good though either. Then again I don't care for disaster movies anyway.
but whatever
anyone likes the soundtrack as much as me?
I still like TDAT more than Independence Day...
haven't seen it in a while
This movie was okish
oh great
It's not that bad actually
BEST MOVIE EVVVVVEEEEERRRRRR!!!!!!!!1
Day before tomorrow.
I saw this movie when I was in Middle School.
04Fluttershy likes the nice score
In my opinion: it's a good movie, just as long as you don't take it too seriously
It claims to preach a message I agree with, but in such a stupid way that it damages its own cause.
00,10long movies tonight
NO, it's the LAND BEFORE TIME XXVI!!!!!!!!!
00,10both of them over 2 hours
HYA
Oh look, it's a thing.

AMERICA!!!!!!! FUCK YEAH
ntartica!
The ozone hole is gonna eat us all!
NOAA
I never liked 2012 a lot because this movie is cooler
Well I can see the reason this movie exists. Humans are in Antarctica.
it's....something
Yes, the illegal American occupation of Antartica
2012 got slow in the 3rd act.
04^Brilliant Nitt
<AlienWarhead>: literally
hebroke it!
Oh...oh no...oh no no no nono nonononononon
00,10this movies plot is on thin ice
Antartica is the land of hatred, because of all the windigoes
Derpy broke the world.
The drilling wouldn't cause the ice cracking.
NO BLOOD FOR ICE
ded
uh ohe
Cthulu has been awakened!
Remember; 'it was like that when I got here
LAWL
Looks like, he's walking on thin ice

Told you, here's the reason this movie exists. Fucking humans, in fucking Antarctica.

Wow. Real fucking unlucky spot to set up camp
00,10and no sismic activity was registered
That's some huge crack

it's not bad
Where did the icepick come from?
The crevases were caused by suicide bomber penguins
why is everyone saying it's bad?
i thught they were filming a movie
NC should do a review of it to explain this
wut?
00,10Some one call planet express
Fez man
globbal warming is bad mkay
the day after tommorow
Or possibly us?
Fezes are cool
Yeah, but the cooling effect of the lack of a Gulf Stream may not be as strong as scientists think.
Fezzes are cool
