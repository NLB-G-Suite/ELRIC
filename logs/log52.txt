Cupcakes are so good!
INB4 Ban!

I prefer Muffins
Kick inbound 3, 2, 1...
check him out
Me too.
Elky, you were flower girl, right?
8muffins > cupcakes
these cupcakes are pretty good
eeyup
but they need a dash of rainbow
4Don't me to cut in, but uh, one of the very best troll attempts I've ever seen was with Cartmen in the South Park ep "Scott Tenorman Must Die"
Agree with Hipster
There's a difference between muffins and cupcakes?
Oh yeah
For example, if you go into a chat where camwhores frequent, and the people there are wait for someone to cam, tell them you see someone, and that there must be something wrong with their screen. They freak out, you lol
Grimdark Muffins
how about painis cupcake?
4And yes, I agree with muffins over cupcakes
He will eat you
I don't like either cupcakes or muffins, make a real cake if you feel like it, or some cookies
Muffins taste horrible with icing....
No need for a weird hybrid
Mmmmm, delicious cupcakes
Chocolate muffins
8... Big Mac?
Muffins have so many more flavors than cupcakes
MUFFINS ARE JUST BALD CUPCAKES. THEY ARE INFERIOR.
I wonder how she got them to come out sky-blue with streaks of rainbow coloring
So muffins win
Gotta make some someday soon
4Except muffins are better
Guys, i'm starting to think you guys are just WINGING IT with these jokes
Some cookies, too
4and taste better
Rainbow dash isn't as cool as FlutterShy. Discuss?
Derpy would be proud that Muffins win

Lag less over here...
I guess something's staringing my connection
If you wanna get Dungeons of Dredmor, Watch a couple vidoes on Youtube first, to see if you'll like
it says you die... alot
Yes you do...
Husky is in this movie?
It has Permadeath but you can turn it off
4Dungeons of Dredmor looks...okay
so it's a dungeon crawL?
And he laughs
Because killing is funny
No, not really, Its a rougelike
or rather a roguelike
hey, pinkie, it's fun!
Go on and make some cupcakes!
roguelikes are awesome!
Killing is funny.
adom is great, but recently I've been getting into ToME
Dem cops
I played anband before I bought it to see if I'd like it

It's a bouncing baby gun!
Wut?
it has a huge world
Was that a bullet?
9god guys
4Holy shit, we're almost at the restaurant scene aren't we?
but that of course means the world isn't very consistent though
4What's up?
9I've been working around with my audio settings and no dice
still good fun
4Sucks
9can't find a way to ge-hey Ghosties I was lookin' for ya
So wait, how far in are in to the movie?
9found any game you like?
4Damn, this movie's going by fast today
1.5 hours?
derp
like 40 ish minutes?
is it just me or is the movie going by quicker?
It is
4People have suggested Dungeons of Dredmor, but I'm not sold on it
I think it's because we're totally not talking about the movie in chat
Because no one is watching it
I suspsect it's because it's earlier, and we're more alert
Except when the SFX happens
Playing DoD Makes this movie go by fast
4Another game in mind was Civilization III complete
4Still
The DSII sound effect is helping, too
4I don't know yet
9so yeah, haven't found a way to capture audio from my USB audio headphones so yeah
9ah, well
I guess it's because we're actually chatting and not just shouting in hope of getting noticed
6Civ III is pretty fun.
9don't worry n'take your time
Well said, Elky.
Eeyup
chat is way too fast sometimes on fridays
4Right, will do
Downloading DoD rightnow
>implying we're not shouting and hoping to be noticed
Friday night is too manestream
that be the truth
4Does this mean you can't mic over games?
)
xD
What.
aargh
What what, Skor423?
That was the best one yet
I agree, chat can go by very fast on Fridays and it is hard to keep up
Don't you just use VAC?
9I can, buuuuuut
6PENUCKLE
9nah, I use Stereo Mix
well once we get like 200+ people
looks interesting Elky, I'll give it a shot
Random sound for random scene
all spamming toot/forever
9thing is, I want audio output to be from the PC to my headphones
And we're not shouting about Leverage either
You must be new here.
9I suppose I could get a mini-jack extension cable...
silvermane: have you played ADoM?
Or at least, you didn't see Death Stalker II
4Dungeons of Dredmor doesn't appear to be for me
Leverage is over rated
9and just plug them into the audio input instead
4No dice, I'm not sold : /
You want the computer sound to go to your headphones?
if not, try it first
Is there a way to put this on slow mode (can't post more than once in a minute or so)?
alright
ADoM? Ok, hat's that?
12bbl
it's like the best roguelike ever
Whom?
9yeah, pretty much
it doesn't have as much content, but it's very, very immersive
Ancient Domane of something?
You can do that with VAC.
9I have this USB microphone headset thing
9yeah
9I was trying to do that with VAC
Ancient Domains Of Mystery
Gotta get some food
9but I can't get it to work
4Is it on Steam?
9so using Occam's Razor
and it was developed by a german guy
im gonna take a look at it
lol ghosties
9I'm just gonna go for the easiest solution
Hmm, ok.
4What
okay
9as a matter of fact I got an extension cable right here
9also
9holy fuck I wish that came out in Steam
4I'm asking a serious question
so familiar
MANRY HUG
the whole genre is way too nerdy for steam
4So I'll take that as a "no"
who plays games with ascii graphics today anymore?
Ya Dredmor has so many refrences in it
brb
no it isn't
good point
anyone play dorfs
unless its a flash game
http://cdn1.knowyourmeme.com/i/000/117/008/original/soon_honey_beer_bottle.jpg?1303752607 http://cdn1.knowyourmeme.com/i/000/117/008/original/soon_honey_beer_bottle.jpg?1303752607 http://cdn1.knowyourmeme.com/i/000/117/008/original/soon_honey_beer_bottle.jpg?1303752607 http://cdn1.knowyourmeme.com/i/000/117/008/original/soon_honey_beer_bottle.jpg?1303752607
except dwarf fortress ofc
i still play diablo II
I tried playing DF but it went over my head
but most people use a tileset for that too
dorfs scares me
I leveled up!
the menus... so many menus...
it's fun once you get the hang of it
so is it possible to play ADoM without joining this website?
yes it is
but as I said, it's an ascii game, so beware
ADOM <3
http://df.magmawiki.com/images/4/40/FunComic.png
it's freaking addicting
4Wow, it certainly does look like Castlevania
i keep coming back to it every month or so
DSN, lol
I keep getting frustrated after I reach like level 16 and go get more than I could handle
every time
I've played it for ~3 years and only won once
XD
killer claw bugs are nasty
Do you eat?
Whats level of addicting is it at? is it at oh I forgot what time it is addicting or OMG I forgot to feed my child addicting?
not with spells
You eat EVERYTHING
no seriously
The soundeffect has really lost its novelty and humour value. Just saying.
rezo: don't even joke about that
the sound effect is holy
4Rezo clearly hasn't seen Deathstalker II
9like Castlevania on crack
9and that can only be a good thing
clearly
4I dunno
we must educate him
10D:
clearly
no idea what they're talking about
BIZINISS
We need a new sound effect
4Castlevania on crack may not be such a good thing
is this english
or italian
10after seeing that film I realised that my life was incomplete before seeing Deathstalker II
italian
Italian
there's no better sound effect
I can't tell the difference with these guys
italiano
Same here, RainBro
I think it's italian
The Room > Deathstalker II
Its time like this I wish I could understand Italian
(troll face.jpg)
the room was boring
The Room./
even with the chat
10Dirty sexy lies SilverMane!
O dear God.
speaking of Room-level badness
6I'm going for a smoke.
RainBroDash, everything I do is dirty and sexy
has anyone seen Birdemic?
Italian bronies, come save us from dem italians!
/me does the dishes
deathstalker at least knew how cheesy it was
Birdemic: Shock and Terror
i think the point is to alienate us, the viewers, to tell us there's something we don't get to know about
see?
and that's bullshit
best hitchcock ripoff ever made
4Don't fall asleep this time :P
I did the dishes... sexy
Well
That's awkward
Ds2 Soundeffect spam
they were having a conversation about who is best pony
/me 10would lol, but is evidently as prone to the same thing happening.
and this is what happens when you do that
people get shot
back
taken out behind the shed, shot, and then turned into glue?
I can imagine SilveMane doing the dishes... all oiled up
oh Elky, you naughty boy. *giggle*
actually silvermane does anything oiled up
Shooting is so fun, shooting is so fun, it's time to check and see what we've done
Yay, they're dead!
8inb4 HEADSHOT!
inb4 neck hole
d-d-double kill?
TRAIN!
BOOM HEADSHOT
He totally saw it coming
pretty little headshots
taht took a while
Gag reflex
DSII sound
That's what you get for saying Fluttershy is the worst pony
need it
>ds2
The movie stole it
Dramatic music
but Fluttershy IS worst pony
Requires more dramatic music.
Authentic news
/me loves and tolerates the shit out of Elky's pony preferences
4@Elky: I gotta go to the bathroom
was this made before the spinning newspaper was a cliche
8Dash is best pony
7probably
Rarity is the worst pony (shit storm brewing up...)
8 /discussion
Prohibition law caused all of this
/me agrees with Elky, actually.
ghosties: I don't get it, are you clopping?
Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash are inferior ponies.
hipster, time for that trollbait comic
LOUD MUSIC IS LOUD
4ANNOYING TRUMPET
Rarity FTW
why isn't there any flute though?
Rarity is best pony
Rarity has the best voice actor
Rainbow and Pinkie FTW
Braeburn is Best Pony
another scene of people walking
Tabitha St. Germain is amazong
4Darf14: Wrong, Ashleigh Ball is best voice actress
Rarity > Twilight > the other four ponies.
4Though, I do like Tara Strong
FLUTTERSHY > Luna > Twilight = Trixie > Rarity > Others, although I think Octavia works into there somewhere
I like 'em all
10brb
I love all of them equally (but Rarity is best pony)
I like them all but those two are my favorites
everybody likes them all, but we like arguing more
But just that Rarity is the least likeable for me
ohyou.jpg
you have to give a lot of credit to Pinkie Pie, she's the only one out of the mane six brave enough to break the 4th wall
Not that there's anything particurally wrong with her
Fluttershy broke the 4th wall
How could anyone not like Rarity? :(
quiet the manchild please
when did Fluttershy break the fourth wall?
"Always Works!"
I don't understand the lack of rarity love after the Dress episode
"Always works," SilverMane
yeah, i don't remember that
In Bird in the Hoof
He gave birth to a baby
oh
Has the Domestic violence scene already happened?
really? that's the best you got? Pinkie Pie grabbed the closing screen and exited the show to talk to us once
isn't this all domestic violence?
4It could have been just a way to assert herself
06Nom
they are a FAMILY after all
/me gets booed offstage
4To show that she's right to herself
By domestic violence, do you mean a long, hard, bare bottomed hairbrush spanking for a naughty and disobedient wife?
Rarity is on my top list BECAUSE of Art of the Dress
6Back
/me thinks DSNesmith likes Rarity for good reason.
same here, but also Dog and Pony show
dog and pony was brilliant too
There are lots of reasons to approve of rarity, even outside of her two key episodes.
although the dog voice actors were a little shrill
No i mean Belt whipping
7wb
Art of the Dress and Dog and Pony show made Rarity cool
Modfoals can't soonforce. :P
Rarity, honestly, has the best episodes that focus on her
diamond dogs *tehehe* i see what you did there Lauren Faust
More than 20% cooler
10idk, i still dont like rarity :P
Rarity gained alot of points for me during Suited for Success but the WA HA HA sealed it
Rainbow Dash is always arrogant in her episodes, AppleJack is far too focused on her apples, Twilight is just a stuck up prick in her episodes, and Pinkie is depressed nitwit in her episodes. Rarity is always an overworked nice person though
silvermane is right, y'know
4SilverMane: Dog and a Pony Show gave fanboys a reason to clop to her
Rarity isn't snooty, she's /artistic/
SilverMane is indeed right
8DAT RACISM
which is why Rarity is third best pony
inb4 Rarity in bondage
/me grabs pen and paper
Oh god, rarity is naked
clopclopclop
where?
Dash isn't arrogant.
>dat flankspank
EVERYWHERE
Does she know any shame?
Silvermane/Rarity porn
it's not shame, it's dignity
4Applejack cares about her family more than her apples
hi Espeon
She makes dresses for living, but is naked all the time!
just throwing it out there
Dash is a bogstandard jock character with a mild asshoel streak, the likes of which exist by the millions.
Good Gravy! They are all naked!
A WELL DONE character of that type, but still.
4So, don't know what SilverMane is trying to say there
" Having or revealing an exaggerated sense of one's own importance or abilities" < definition. There's notthing more imporant than Dash, and no one is as skilled as her, therefore not arrogant.
who goes to the most important party in all of equestria with her friends just so she can sell apples? that's just showing a lack of social grace. I bet she didn't even have a vendor permit
Just imagine them all in their underwear
oh, wait.
nothing*
celestia is never naked
Elky, DO IT
Applejack is the only not-naked pony thanks to her hat
suddenly we are in Italy
silvermane, I'll ask /co/
Applejack's rural-ness shows, yes.
06hii
And before we didnät
4HonkyDory: I'm sure you're just trying to troll, but she did it for her family
No idea what high society even IS
DSNesmith, ship me and Rarity so that Elky doesn't have to go to /co/
they'll do anxthing if I say it'll piss ponychan of
dang, Italy looks nothing like the mushroom kingdom
Silly you
The mushroom kingdom is japanese
its' mushroom kingdom because they are all ON mushrooms
arent they in Sicily?
Mushroom Kingdom is in Brooklyn!
hey...
A knock on the door drew her attention-a customer?
well they sure aren't in Equestria that's for sure
I like where this is going, DSN
We NEED Super Mario Brothers on BMN
>slip in and out
Oh boy, a fic in middle of a chat
and I'm spent
Rezo-chan: Too late.
4DSNesmith is about to do a fanfic
4EVERYBODY WATCH OUT
"Ah, welcome to the Carousel Botique!" she began
God I'm so sick of SHip
Already happened?
dammit
Eeyup.
stopping in shock as the door opened.
DO YOU EAT?
/me 10is poised and waiting for the clopfest
ready the tissues!
This is a more riveting story than the movie
There stood a pony she didn't recognize-his silvery mane shimmering in the sunlight
Suddenly, rape
She'd never seen color so striking
Inb4 Its silvermane
4RAPE HER
and then they all hugges
then rarity was phone
she had to style it. She HAD TO
Rarity and the octopus.
/me likes where this is going.
oclopus
"My dear, what can I do for you?" She asked, still staring lustfully at the stranger's mane.
Lawl.
xD
4Oh boy
lustfully
ESPEON *glomp*
:3
'lustfully'
I approve of this.
Although it needs more forced consent.
Rarity X Octopus, nah too Japanese for my taste....YOU HEARD NOTHING!
"Ah, pizza delivery," he said.
:D
Rarity eats pizza?
lol
and then spike found out and beat rarity to death in a jealous rage
4A delivery boy? How original
But then a pony burst in with a bomb strapped to his chest, "Praise Celestia" He said as he tackled SilverMane.
SUCH MOUTH
>implying Spike isn't watching thorugh a crack in the wall
/me laughs evilly
i love how much attention I get on this site
Spike is a voyeur kind of guy
you sure are an attention magnet
"I don't recall ordering any-" Rarity began, when suddenly three smaller ponies stampeded past her toward the door.
xD
"CUTIE MARK CRUSADER PIZZA PARTY!" they all shouted
10YAY*
Okay
/me really likes where this is going.
yeah, he probably has hidden cameras set up in her bedroom
/me also
Good lord silvermane
Orgy with Rarity and CMC?
/me leaves channel.
Have fun, kids.
The three fillies grabbed the pizza box and ran out the door, leaving behind a stunned Rarity and Pizzapony
oh RainBroDash, don't get jealous, Rarity is just so beautiful.
13!espeon
4Pizzapony's his name
4Gotcha
10SHUT UP SILVERMANE NOPONYLOVESYOULIKEIDO
*already clops furiously*
10;_;
AHHH!, The mental images!
"Uh, so, you gonna pay for this?" asked the pizzapony.
'pay'
applause
/me hugs RainBroDash to comfort him.
"I'm afraid I haven't got any money on me..." said Rarity nervously.
10:<
I love how cheesy this is
Oh noes,
4He's a "thing" now?
The cliches
"but I'm sure I could find some /other/ way to pay you."
4Really?
lol Elky pun
Oh the cliches
4We're insulting Pizzapony?
This isn't cheezy!
6ITC: Shipping.
10Oh shit. This genuinely looks like a classic porn intro.
"how about I make you a dress!"
Oh damn
i love this movie
xD
Oh
"a... dress."
MAKE ME A DRESS
This, during the Godfather
10and with that, RBD was proved flamboyantly wrong
10>.<
"Oh, why, certainly!"
Wait
he likes dresses?
I want a Rarity original
"Erm, male ponies don't usually wear dresses."
4I don't like where this is going
PERFECT TIMING
"BUT MY DEAR, YOUR HAIR!"
dat sound
suprise sound affect
they wear clothes
hhahaha
=o
Y NO SEX THOUGH
Dat Timing
Daw
lmao
patience...
"It'S SO PERFECT, I simply must create an ensemble piece around it."
4Huh, she could kinda pass off for Olivia Munn
mmmm
Olivia Munn...
10mfw silvermane ends up going transgender and seducing rainbrodash and then all was normal again.
i feel like a lot of this movie's problems could be solved if they just made each other dresses and giggled at the ghosties
"Look, I've got some more deliveries to make later this afternoon..."
"No, no, I insist!" Rarity slammed the door shut and locked it with her magic.
dammit RainBroDash, i was drinking when I read that. Almost spat it out all ove rmy laptop
Lawl.
"Come upstairs, and let's get busy!"
don't get me started on transgender... did you know Deathstalker 1 has two sex changes?
10THAT LINE
4YOU WILL DRESS FOR ME!
10FUKKIN SAVED
...
/me really, REALLY likes where this is going.
get busy
Must watch Desthstalker I
Is someone going to compile this and post on EqD?
this is gonna get hawt...
sighing, Pizzapony followed her upstairs. Why did so many ponies in this town fall all over themselves around him?
10I am MrPoniator, don't you worry
I've got to be honest, I've been away for a while and am still a tad confused as to why we're doing a clopfic in the chat...
YES! Reference joke!
Ithink we should with all the interrruptions in it
4Because Godfather is boring
4That's why
french, because SilverMane
4So we're entertaining ourselves
Like it actually is someone trying to tell a story
10silvermane, this is your life
french, it's because SilverMane me, and they love me
I sometimes even forget we're watching the Godfather
That's all the excuse I need ^^
Because everypony wants to ship with SilverMane.
The movie has it boring parts, but it is still a good movie
10darf14, what movie?
Haha, RainBro.
lol
The God Father silly
I don't want...
It's a forgettable movie. Live-written clop fiction isn't.
MORE SHIPPING DSNESMITH
Screw brony movie night
Its the most praised movie ever so its bound to have lots of haters
I'll have to watch this movie alone... I honestly can't pay attention while clopping to SilverManexrarity clopfiction
"Alright, I'll need you to lift your hooves up here for me, darling." Rarity scurried arond her shop, looking for her measuring tape.
Let's do more live clop fic writing
4Ignaesia: Actually, Citizen Kane is the most praised movie ever
shut up bitch and make me a sammich
this is the 3rd time I've seen someone write a shipper live
I don't know why this has never happened before!
10calling it. next week this will be a regular saturday feature.
inb4 she bondage rapes him
"Oh, there it is!" Rarity picked up her measuring tape, turning around.
"Now, I'm just missing one thing-"
RainBroDash, I won't be here next two weeks
"aha!"
apparently all the best films are fucking snorefests. Citizen Kane, The Godfather...
10But SilverMane, I...
>measuringt tape...
her horn glowed as she magically lifted her incredibly stylish designing glasses onto her nose.
03I just passed a guy having a yard sale
03who just gave me 4 TVs for free
He is going River City Randsome on his ass
rezo-chan what about Shawshank
03so my SUV's trunk has 2 VCRs (I paid $5 for each) and four small CRT TVs in it xD
"Now, dear, let me take your measurements!"
Bespectacled Rarity is best Rarity *clop*
haven't seen that one
Key word being here, "measurements"
that's what you get for punching a woman
"measurements"...
03anyone need a VCR or a small TV?
XD
10>bespectacled.
10BEST WORD
4Simpsons did this scene better
oh god I know where this is going
"Oh, yes, perfect-" she continued talking as she wound the tape around Pizzapony's legs
Ty, Rainbro
06hey drf
...
oh gawd
10oh lawdy
Simpsons did this scene? I guess you learn something new every day
06i saw you destroying a hard drive
06that YT video
wait, why did he die?
10simpsons did every scene
03yep
I am copy-pasta this whole thread
03XD
yeah when Marge beat up the mugger
4Yeah, except the genders were reversed
random
Dat SFX
EEEAARRGH
4Homer gets beaten on, so Marge whoops some guy's ass
06i know a better way to destroy it
That sounds funny
Simpsons are BASED around stealing scenes. They were never capable of originality
06a Hefttruck/Forklifter
10@silvermane I've got this in notepad, it's all gouda
03I didn't have access to one of those./
06run over it, i tried that
"Oh, this simply must include a silver ring on the horn, set just so!"
is there a proper text version of that sound effect?
03I didn't have a car on campus either
4Elky: !!!!!!!!!!!!!
4There
Oh leverage.
Why do I feel that ring is a sex toy...?
The pizzapony shuffled his feet awkwardly. "Uh, I'd rather you didn't fool around with my horn."
sup everypony
4That's the text version
EEEEEAAAAAGGGGHHHH
/me is okay that he is being made into a Unicorn
8fun fact: my mom worked with matt groening when they were both in college
4Neat, Hip
Sup Bjornfot
...I see we're watching the zzzfather
that's perfect ghosties!
06oh, i see
8inb4 titties
And how do you know it's a /unicorn/ horn, Silvermane?
Bjornfot: No, we're watching live action clopfiction.
"Oh, don't be silly, darling, it's all for the art." Rarity stretched the tape out.
I'm only here for Leverage, really.
06hitting it with the forklifter is awesome, with a lot of mess afterwards :P
"My goodness, I've never seen one quite this large before!"
Oh.
06i also used a jackhammer
/me apologizes for that line
...
Porn on text AND in film
Neat
Oh Gawd.
06fun :3
10dat line. again.
what.
If I had more leverage, I'd be getting shipped right now
oh lawd
incoming rape SFX
No need to apologise, DSN
Oh boy here we go.jpg
Sorry Srake, only I get shipped around here
Stoppingin for 5 seconds basically so I could say that we're watching The Godfather of bad movies along with the actual Godfather
I sense the sound affect coming
10SilverMane has the most leverage in the chat
inb4 tits
Sex to Godfather music

10LOL hipster

10xD
No. Those nipples are... weird.
Oh my
True, they were
"I... um..." Rarity's eyes widened. "Oh, my."
What nipples?
Also, Males>Females
She has none
"Something wrong?" Pizzapony asked.
How much of this movie is left?
imagine you had to explain to your friends what you're doing in here...
10OH MY
Dang, the SFX didn't happen I am not a psychic!
10XDD
hI
a good 2 hours...
"Nothing, darling." Rarity blinked as a bead of sweat slid down her face.
10brilliant.
Oh shit
Hi fluttershy
Right SilverMane? riiite?
no DS2 sound effect, I am dissappoint
what was that Bjornfot?
10Elky, we're your friends.
Well, I guess I'm staying, but only because it's The Godfather
10but I 100% get you dude bahahaha
10so awkward :D
Everyone is staying because of DSN now
it's okay. My friends know I'm a creepy pervert
for some reason, it all makes sense though...
10^win
She is jumping to conclusions
so when does this end >_>
SilverMane: I just stated the fact that Males>Females. In sexiness.
MY FAVORITE SCENE!
NEEEEEEVER
what's awkward about the godfather? If you ignore the live my little pony clopfic, it's perfectly fine!
"Look, maybe I should just go..." Pizzapony stepped off the modeling platform.
BAF FUNG GU!
what was she doing out of the kitchen anyway?
/me pauses to enjoy the ridiculous movie
>Sizilian Women
bjorn, I'm hetero, but this is so true
XD, yep, staying for DSN
10NO PAUSING. WORK, PEON
AM FED UP WITH THIS WORLD
Im staying for this scene
This won't byte him in the ass later on
And this is another example of why Males>Females in any other situation to.
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE
What a happy marriage!
sorry, i find Women more enthralling in al lsenses of the word, but men can hold some images women cant
this scene gives me an idea for the fic
Look, I'm real happy and Imma let you finish, but Citizen Kane had the best room destruction scene of all time
KILL HIM!
I will love and tolerate the **** out of you woman!
I'm clopping to this
YOU'RE TEARING ME APART LISA!

You require more Sound effects.
10yay@dsnesmith

/me says ponies and me
and then sex happened and 9 months later baby happened
"No, please! Don't leave!" Rarity rushed to the door, slamming it with her hoof.
hurry nesmith, erections don't sustain themselves
Hey, the care does have reverse gear.
car*
10how is babby formed?
"Look, miss..."
Weren't you already clopping furiously, elky?
8ITS A TRAP
/me walks in and back out.
Then they gave her plastic surgery for her wounds that would make Marlon Brando cringe
oh wait
"Rarity!" She gushed breathlessly. "Call me Miss Rarity!"
I can't clop to the godfather
But you will
inb4 all dead
but you can to ponies?
it'd be like cloppig to fluttershy
8DSII
Ok, I was wrong, this did bit him in the ass later on.
boring
7its a trap!

Pizzapony sighed. "I've seen enough hentai to know where this is going."
This makes no sense.
They had m60's back then?
After everyone dies... DSII

Haha

Can't to that
8did he died?
I think he died from lead poisoning
Rarity shook her head, screaming in sexual frustration.
top*
that sfx made the scene 20000% better
7yes he's dead
wait, I dropped my canoli!
10i can clop to DS2 sound effect
Sexual.... frustration?
10read dropped as clopped...
It had been so long since she'd touched another pony-so very, very long
I just play it on repeat and i don't even need to clop anymore
Hey, are you okay?

@Ignaesia: Best ending ever
Pizzapony replaced Silvermane

She rushed forward, leaping at Pizzapony, her mouth devouring his like Pinkie Pie eating cake

Pizzapony reach his head up and stuck out his tongue. He gently ran it over Rarity's horn, drawing a gasp.

Random no at a building
Rarity smiled, blushing. "But even I let my hair down from time to time."
7not exactly random
4Do you think Apollonia was from Appoloosa?
She's letting her hair down?
What a douchepony!
So when is Rarity gonna make his dress?
'hair'

Suddenly, there came a knock on the door.
/me 10delivers pizzas on weekends

Rarity jerked upright, here eyes wide.
*is
oshit

"HEY! RARITY! WE FORGOT OUR CAPES!"

hornblocked
:DDD
7brb food :)
lawl
lol faaaaiiiil
She usually doesn't wear anything
6k
A voice that sounded very much like Appleblooms said "Uh, we don't normally wear clothes, do we?"
Exactly
btw guys, keep an eye on this shipping
Brando's accent should duke it out in an arena with Jeff Bgidge's True Grit accent
6I am.
if it starts getting sexual, start warning
6Trust me.
6I am.
A voice that sounded very much like Srake said "Uh, we don't normally wear clothes, do we?"
and I still wouldn't understand them
10>very much like applebloom's. It was applebloom's through the muffle of a gimp mask imho
I am recording this entire conversation, for the annals.
4Don Corleone and Rooster Codburn, now THAT'S an awesome duo
Rarity looked around, frantically. She magically opened her closet and stuffed Pizzapony inside.
"Uh, just a minute!"
the old closet trick? nice...
and that is how i died
Someone must post this on /oat/ and EqD after this is done
gotta love cliches
I thought it said chest
Is it cold in here, or are my nipples all over the place?
"now I'm trapped in the closet, so I pulled out my gun.."
Stuff Pizzapony in a chest
Agreed with MrPoniator.
WAT
YOU MUST
She slammed the closet shut and turned around, panting. The door burst open and the three Cutie Mark Crusaders charged inside.
dammit snow, stop poking me with your nipples!
All in favor for best BMN?
4Well, we've already passed that
Aye
WutisBMN?
AYE

4<Captain_of_the_Ship>: Pizzapony reach his head up and stuck out his tongue. He gently ran it over Rarity's horn, drawing a gasp.

thats the only reason im not warning him now
ALL THE CLOPPING. ALL OF IT
That it I am putting on head phones just in case
Applebloom and Scootaloo began searching the room for their capes, digging under desks and knocking over models.
4Yeah
don't check the closet
"Whatcha doin' sis?" asked Sweetie Belle.
Wait
Silvermane are you reading that Rainbow Dash x Cloud fic again?
Not my models!
4He's starting again
10I missed that line, lawl
Is it normal for everyone I know to know this score on guitar?
oh, this is going to go well...
Corleone, Tattaligha, Barzini, Stracci... who were the 5th family again?
no Dashite... i've memorized it
10Thanks, that's now in my transcript x)
"Oh, uh, nothing, Sweetie..." Rarity said, nervously eyeing the closet.
The Apple Family, Ignaesia
:3
dat tension
Havetubawilltravel :D
4Oh, BTW, RBD, we HAVE to do Killing Floor after the show's over
I like how the pizza pony doesn't seem to give a crap
Is pizzapony gonna come out of the closet?
4And I need to enlist the aid of Gilda and Derp
apple family is best family
Sweetie trotted over to the closet, reaching for the door. Rarity gasped-
Strangely sounds like the Spanish Luigi from SMB
that joke gave me cancer srake
Pizzapony better deliver my pizza asap
4I've got all ten circus achievements and I need help so I can get the Abusement Park achievement
And suddenly... Cancer!
4So then I can get Mr. Foster
I read captain_of_the_ship's fanfiction for the plot
8BAHAHAHAHAHAHA
"FOUND EM!" yelled Scootaloo, holding up a trio of gold capes.
Somewhere out there
/me drops off a pizza as he flies by Darf14. Anchovies and Peanut Butter?
10oh ok
whew..
Someone is going to make a pizzeria with the name pizza pony
lol
The three fillies high-hooved eachother, rushing out of the room
Yay my favorite *eats pizza*
There's already the Stone Pony
man, now I want to have some pizze
pizza*
4Yeah, I don't mean to put you on the spot. But I'd like to do this today since I won't be around tomorrow
LUNA SOUNDBITE WINS EVERYTHING
was that luna just then?
well, that was close...
Luna is best pony
*Tips pizzapony*
SPike is best pony
Wit his...
I bet that pizza has gotten cold by now
With, even.
Does no one read the chat topic anymore? It clearly states that Rainbow Dash is best pony.
I'm finally going dow n to the 2nd level
the cmc ate the pizza already
Do they ever eat the pizzas in pornos?
Rarity listened at the door, waiting for the sound of the three fillies to fade into the distance.
Pizza fetish
8Dashite: eeeeeeeeeeyup
10ha yeah, it just depends how tired I am after BMN is all. We might not be able to complete a long game if I'm not on optimum concentration
back to clopping
eeey-nope.
I stand corrected... Luna is best pony after Dashie.
time for grimdark, finding me dead in closet
She breathed a sigh of relief, and turned back to the closet. She opened the door, grinning.
I mustache your permisson.
"Now where were we?"
12Back

MAKE HIM HIS DRESS
10THEN HE WAS PHONE

10>there were spikes on the inside of the door, he was corpse.
D: please no cliffhanger
HonkyDory, just chill
The Cake(cup) was a lie!
8AND THEN A SKELETON POPPED OUT
There stood Pizzapony, dressed in something she thought she'd burned-Rainbow Dash's 'revised' dress
4Well, we'll talk after BMN is over
SKELETON?
OHHHHHHHHNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSS

15That's awesome!
10THE GOLDEN BOOTS
0Okay.

Appropriote music is appropriote

Has SirSprinkles fallen asleep yet?
How long is this movie.
Rarity grabbed him with both her hooves, her eyes shining with need.
4Probably, Dashite
So this is going to carry on and even while Battlefield Earth, this story is going?

"Come here you marvelous stallion!"

Leverage?
0FOR HE'S A JOLLY GOOD BRONY!
Yes.
She pulled him out of the closet, tumbling back to the floor.
Dam you accordion!
This actually is a great movie but you need to be in the serious movie-watching mood for it
I think so too ignas
:)
10HAY, CAMAN, SCRAM
>not in serious-movie watching mood now...obviously
I am loving this so much. Don't even care that I just cross-dressed
Pizzapony kissed her again and again, savouring the sweet scent of her.
0LET'S WTCH B MOVIE, THEN.
I've never seen this movie all the way through, just pieces

Rarity breathed deeply, taking in Pizzapony's manly aroma
we take Francis Ford Coppola films very seriously
Well. It's not much worse than Spider's web, at least
>manly aroma

Battlefield Earth? God save us all

LEverage!
Battlefield Leverage was so much better than Godfather.
I don't want yo uto get in trouble, so if you need to go about pg13, we can continue this story elsewhere
Pizzapony's kisses began to travel down Rarity's neck. She moaned with delight as every nerve in her body lit on fire.
*KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK*
GOD DAMNIT
I will now lift the Jinx off of you Ignaesia
MY NERVES ARE ON FIRE! MY NERVES ARE ON FIRE! MY NERVES ARE ON FIRE!

Her door burst open, and in soared a blue pegasus, wings flapping furiously.

"WHAT, Rainbow Dash?" Rarity asked, her hair frizzled and her eye twitching.

"That's wonderful, Rainbow Dash, but I'm really kind of bus-"
Okay, she wants her costume

"Rarity you've GOTTA make me a sweet uniform!"

He stretched his head up next to hers, gently biting her ear. Rarity let out another moan, her sweat-soaked body writing in delight.
The broadcast came, and then it fell asleep

"Sorry to bother you, Rarity, but I lost a book and I've been looking for it everywhere!"
hola
hello...
people stopped talking, got scared
Can I cut out you heart?
me too pizza
is the book by the fan perchance?
"It wasn't in Sugarcube corner, it's not in the library anywhere, and I haven't even been to Applejack's farm since I lost it."
Everypony knows Rarity is a notorious book thief
hot unicorn action
THE BOOK IS UNDER THE BED
it's called 'Magic Book'
Rarity made a little 'eep' sound.
"Er, what book was it?"
It's called "Karma Sutra"
Ohai everybrony
I'm sure the book is "Clopping is magic"
Twilight blushed. "Um,
7hello Dermathil
:D
I'M SPARKKLY
/me hits HaveTubaWillTravel for stealing his joke

I'm working on getting The Fluttershy Effect made. Does this channel keep logs?
Yeah.
It better should!
:P
Actually, that story will probably never make it on paper.
(:
Michael is way more threatening than Vito, agree?
pm'd you, Captain
"Um, it's, er..."
One of these days I'm going to be as famous as Tacowiz!
4Well, Michael has that youth going for him
"Reform School Fillies." Twilight blushed harder.
4Vito doesn't look or sound very threatening
classy
DAMMIT!
lol
Classy
8dashite: thats not something to strive for
it's from 'Twilight and Rarity's Magic Book'
10that fic...
Rarity's eyebrow raised. "Sorry, Twilight, I don't have that here. Why don't you try the... OTHER bookstore?"
10oh lawdy
true ghosties
BROTHER WANTS ATTENTION, SEND HIM TO LAS VEGAS
we know pizza
I would've suggested "You can't rape a stallion"
Oh,its worrying that I know the book...
/me starts to look around the chat for a possible lawnchair target.
Its Deathstalker 2 the novelization
Twilight winced, and ran off. "Thanks, Rarity, sorry to bother you."
/me thinks this movie can go trip on a sidewalk.
7hehehe
Lawl.
OOPSIE
what was that sound?
wow
Rarity shut the door. "Drat, I wondered when she'd notice I never returned it."
4Michael has nothing to feel sorry about
flutterguy
4He did the right thing
6Flutterguy Oopsie
OOPSIE DAISY
xD
I KNEW IT!
oh rarity
SHE IS A BOOK THIEF!
Wait, you're paying attention to the plot Ghosties?

4BITCH BITCH BITCH BITCH
7someone*
Ghosties is actually watching the movie?
10price-dari, the plot of what?
She levitated Pizzapony off the ceiling and back onto the bed, still tied up in the bedsheets.
4Yes, because it's almost over
10prince* wow
Quick Sprinkles! Put on Spider's Web!
Whut
O_o
7xD
4And I actually, /kinda/, like Michael Corleone
lol
Who came up with "The Fluttershy Effect" title? He can help me with this.
/me likes where this is going
What.
all the scenes with Michael as the Godfather are much more interesting
WHO IS PLAYING WITH A SOUNDBOARD?!
6Can you blame me? I've seen this movie three times in three days now.
ghosties! but I thought you...
The Fluttershy Effect is a play on 'The Butterfly Effect', and is actually a pretty good story
7nah i'm not blaming you
bastuhd
Yeah.
THIS MOVIE IS AN EXAMINATION ON THE DARKSIDE OF THE ITALIAN MAFIA AND THE RISKY DARK BUSINESS ASSOCIATED WITH IT
12Is there a script that will show you random quotes from IRC?
4Well, the BIGGEST reason is because Michael is actually intimidating AND I UNDERSTAND HIM WHEN HE TALKS
something new...
Oh god, oh god
Watched the movie.
This fic is getting kinky
How much longer till this movie ends?
LOL

MUSICK?
nope?

No Dermathil! You'll take out the stream again!
inb4 yelling
ENOUGH
my body is ready
BITCHES DON'T KNOW ABOUT MY BUSINESS
Dashite, my lawnchairs are non-lethal weaponry.
inb4 She goes to the kitchen.
wow, isn't that the line they had in this 'milk money' trailer?
Do you wanna try 'em?
Rarity sidled up to the not-unwilling captive Pizzapony
'DON'T ASK ME ABOUT MY BUSINESS'
LOL
EEEYUP
eyup
8eeeeeeeeeeyup
Does anyone have a good name for the story?
eeeeyup
/me fires his rocket lawnchair again.
Then what's a good title for "Severe Weather Rampage Through Ponyville/Equestria/Etc. Ronald Emmerech-style?"
But it's rocket powered... how can it be non-lethal?!
/me really, really, REALLY likes where this is going.
Big Mac is a troll
she opened her mouth wide, and sensuously stroked his horn.
shameless silver insert
4It's strange

"Pizzapony delivers, Rarity serves"
4I didn't like Michael when he WASN'T a mobster, but I like him when he became one

Rarity roared, kicking over her lamp.
>DS2's theme goes with anything
Ghosties its one of this most famous roles, its why he pulls off Tony Montana so well in Scarface imo
/me is happy pony
>DS2 theme is best theme
She stormed to the door, swinging it open. "WHAT?!"
xD
"Oh, um, hi, Rarity."
Dem navigation sounds.

12Hmm, I don’t think there is. I might start working on one
APPLEJACK! <3

Rarity, what are you doing here? You're supposed to be trying to seduce me at your boutique

Rarity coughed. "Sorry, Fluttershy. I forgot. You'll have to come back later, I'm right in the middle of a really BIG job right now."

NO

No argument there
They rolled over on the floor, macking furiously.

unless you code ANOTHER copy of EVERY one of your scripts and make it ON IMPUT instead
DAMMIT PONKIE!
Once that pie enters his lower intestine, boom
Pizzapony's head began moving south. Rarity breathed deep in expectation, when suddenly-
*ON INPUT
PINKIE*
*BANGBANGBANGBANG*
I'm gunna leave that there.
Deal with it.
Boxing pony is epic
DEADLY POISONOUS APPLEPIES

Why do mods dislike name changed? D:
And AJ, too now apparently
TOOT!
6Because it gets spammed.
6It's really annoying.
inb4 PizzaPony is actually... SILVERMANE
Godfather theme hint?
Yes i went there
O.O
Applejack stared at the door expectantly. It slammed open to reveal Rarity, her mane a mess and her eye quivering like Pinkie on a sugar high.
let's have
10pizzapony don't be silly, you'll never be as amazing as silvermane
a PARTAY
im fine just leaving it on +n for now
"CAN I HELP YOU?"
6Agreed.
and so began 200 years of slaughter and conquest by the pony settlers
Pie, it solves all of life
10>mfw you can't even nickchange back because of +N ;)
Captain, can you pause the story for... half an hour, or until I get back?
umad pizzapony?
6But it gets to be a pain when somepony d/c's and can't get back to their regular nick.

Lolol Scientology
Good leverage with counting all the leverages.
it's the distant future, the year 3000
6They'd have to leave the channel and change.
inb4 side character dies offscreen

You'll need some pretty epic leverage.
But not extinct, hell yeah!

In 3000, bronies only exist
6 2 minutes is a long time for a mod to have to wait.
inb4 I vomit fro mthe camera angles
Man is an endangered species? are they ripping that part off of Battlestar Galactica?
Hasbro is done with conquering the world by then
10you won't be able to do any mod stuff for that time signed in under a non mod name anyway?
lol
10it makes 0 difference.
Glad I'm not the only one, HeavyMetal

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
6Which is why it's a problem.
*VADER VOICE* NOOOOOOOOO!

In a world ruled by ponies, Man is nearly extinct
is this movie MLP-audio-ified too>
Vader knows that feel,bro.
That man animal, I can tell he has leverage.
thats why we have multiple mods though
rivaling nick cage
Only the bronies survive
LOL at the windows movie maker wipe
http://imgur.com/LQ0gr.jpg
Never saw this, only the NC review
6True, but still.
Your leverage... he leveraged in the night.
I know from some of the levers and from issuing some leverage in my time.
somepony should make a Leverage PMV
10no sprinkles, I mean regardless of your ability to change name in chat
A DEMON. A MONSTER.
IM ACTING!
6RAWR!
10that affects none of it
is there a way we can put exceptions on mods?
yeah
TILTING
XD
Such large hammed acting
I don't even know what I'm watching
MAN GREW SELFISH
TILTING IS WINNING
10unless you use a command to neutralise the ghost that's hogging your name, but most people don't
6Likely not.
Bleeeeeeegh
SWINGING
THINKING HE HAD LEVERAGE AGAISNST DEMOSN
AND GODS
was that a straight shot
Looks like I have to tilt the monitor to view the movie straight
Is mlp cannon in Battlefield earth?
6Yeah, but we all know the command, so...
Yes.
my head hurts from tilting
O noes.
Dat leveraged camera angle.
No internet in future?
6And if not, not hard to get it.
Awesome
It should be.
10Yarp, I know the command too
4Trust me
my neck, to be exact
XD
/me sets an automatic rocket lawnchair turret for while he is gone.
4There's a shit ton of screen tilting
4in this film
Look at the leveraged from the music score
Ghosties: the number of times leverage is said in the film or the chat?
Like 90% of the film is tilted.
4Film
there are fewer normal shots than tilted ones
/me cries
4Sol
02WHY
02WHY
This screen tilting needs...
7Hmm.
in the year 3000 bronies will have taken over the earth by then, this movie is WAY too inaccurate
4I'll be keeping count
Fun Fact: Derpy was the camera Pony for this film
This movie requires more Tilting.
02Sign 99% acc
YHW?
021 MISTAKE
Derpy isn't actually blind, she sees things more than us
02Almost FC ;-;
OK, because if it was the chat, you'd have your work cut out for you XD
The director must have had a tilting fetish...
Why isn't this movie upside down yet?
7Well, I've just resetted for a Bold Dream Lileep with Max HP and 28-29 Sp. Def.
Camera needs more leverage to get regular shots
if we were to look through her eyes
it would look something like this
You require additional Tilt!
4Haha, I know :P
!say !quotes
!quotes
needs more tilt
02(Taiko no tatsujin dororon yokai daikenssen
02+)
True fact: The director for this movie had ADHD
TOOT
more tilllt
>dat tilt
Oh, I thought you were going to count the leverage of the chat.
I can count the number of straight filmed scenes on my fingers
I'll do that then.
4Also true fact: L. Ron Hubbard wrote this
STARWARS TRANSITION!!
No leverage on chat.
>implying this movie had a director
Dem Tilting fetishes

I'm also counting Leverage. Its' my destiny, I was banned for it and all.

4Yeah, there was supposed to be a sequel
what is it with leverage? have i missed something?
This movie has the worst leverage out of every leverage that we have ever leverage, surely the leverage of the leverage affects were spent on leverage donuts and leverage on the side.

7Did you know there's a movie called leverage?
The camera man must have had a seriously bad neck injury
7http://pinartarhan.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Leverage-2008.jpg
They're walking up a mountain right?
green and blue sky?
you mean orange
What a craplousy planet.
gawn
they're walking down it
This needs shopped.
actually a TV show, but yes
my god the camerawork is terible
4You know, I think if this was just a straight sci fi film I'd enjoy it. But because it was written by L. Ron Hubbard and because he so fervently believes in this bullshit he perpetuates, I can't help but feel that this is tainted because of it
the gravity changes from side to side
hello
ghosties.. no haha
Orange sky = Breathable Blue sky = TOXIC!
it's bad.
Ghosties: this movie is so offensively poor that you'd hate it even uninvolved with hubbard
wait, it was going?
HOHOHOHOHOOHO
4I said I'd "enjoy it"
?
?
?
?
?
agreed captain
4Didn't say it was good
EHEHEHEHEHEHEHEH
Ghosties I dont hate this movie because of L Ron, I just hate it because it's awful
DAWGS YO
DAWG
8do ho ho
Dog?
yo dawg
THESE IDIOTS ACTUALLY THINK DOGS ARE MORE INTELLIGENT THAN HUMANS?
4I actually find it slightly enjoyable
Whats is this Dog you speak of?
I heard you liked bad movies
8trolled by the spam filter
He has approved additional leverage.
I HEARD YOU LIKE LEVERAGE IN YOUR LEVERAGE
yeah.. i find L Ron just hilariously pathetic, not sure it really affects my view of this movie
They must have dogs confused with ponies
O shit
Dogs had more leverage.

10<Captain_of_the_Ship>: Applejack stared at the door expectantly. It slammed open to reveal Rarity, her mane a mess and her eye quivering like Pinkie on a sugar high. <Captain_of_the_Ship>: "CAN I HELP YOU?"
"Oh, please, GENTLE" or something?
ohai mane

"Ah, hello, Rarity." Applejack leaned back apprehensively.

4My patience is waning, if I do not have a leverage soon...

Except combustible atmosphere
"And, ah, well, I accidentally got mah hat stuck on a tree branch." Applejack laughed nervously. "That Bloomberg, always such a prankster..."
There must be a twist to the hell
8WHILE YOU WERE STILL LEARNING HOW TO SPELL LEVERAGE
pony hell would be babysitting the CMC
I ALREADY TOLD YOU SilverMane, YOU BEING SHIPPED WITH CIRCUITMANE
8I WAS LEARNING HOW TO LEVERAGE GALAXIES

Hmm....a green alien alcoholic drink.....heck ill try anything for once
8Why can't I hold all these drinks?
CONQUER LEVERAGES
GALAXIES, Y u no leverage.
CMC wouldn't need babysitting, they'd have to babysit me
Okay, now my only hope is the fic
"And, ah, mah hat seam got ripped, and, ah, well, yer the best pony round these parts when it comes to fixin' clothes..."

Because of all the ponies

Okay, best line in movie out of the way. Now back to the clopfic
Rarity stared at Applejack. Applejack looked around uneasily.
Yay, mustard
What?
Mmm, leverage time!
"Give me the hat."
mmmm....mustard from a hose
"Er?"
"GIVE ME THE HAT."

Rarity grabbed the hat, slamming the door.
CHAT, Give me some leverage as to why I should stay here
4uMMM
WHEN THE DAY COMES, BRONIES SHALL ASCED INTO EQUESTRIA IN OUR NEW PURE FORMS AN LL NON BELIEVERS WILL BE PURGED INTHE FIRES OF FRIENDSHIP
4Ummm
ten seconds later, the door burst open again.
Applejack's hat? ripped? that's a crime against fabulosity!
4Because of LEVERAGE
leverage.
"THERE. HAT. GO. NOW."
heh
That was a quick fix
Rarity shoved the repaired hat back at Applejack and shut the door again.

You should stay because of us.

"Ooh ooh ooh I know!" Pinkie vanished under the bed.

/me stops by the apple farm to deliver pizza and notices a strange pile of paper on the ground. He hears two fillies yelliing about something. He picks up the story, reading the title. 'A Pizza Party'. Hmm, I wonder what it's about? He starts reading. As the two fillies notice him, his face is ablaze. He drops the pizza and runs when he sees them.
13I've heard of RNG and it sounds like a lot of work |D
I'd like to read the whole thing as a whole on one sitting too..

the image I mean
Mac doesn't clop fillies. Fillies clop him.
cool
13I know a few people who think that there are 4 primary colours: red, blue, yellow and green
Wouldn't that be rape?
Silly captain_of_the_ship, Big Mac only wants Caramel!
lol fail
How else do you think he got that side-scar?
8>can I blow the dome?
13Green is clearly not a primary colour =w=
HOLY SHIT! Replacing < with line breaks worked!

Ieverage 4, roger
14I'm actually surprised not that much people know what warm/cool colors are
hipster_brony even though they lost in 9mins 1000 years ago
Hipster_Brony: They keep them in shape so when humanity rebels, they have something to use
03I kind-of don't think about primary colors as red/blue/yellow anymore
A dozen fighters against hundreds of alien ships? LEVERAGE!

03red/green/blue are primary colors, white is all the colors combined, and black is the absense of any color.

6http://miburl.com/kc63gQ
Same Bane.
I like spring :3
Give me a foot of snow. I'll be happy.
6im bad at links
Spring is my favorite season.
Mother nature gets pissed that time of year.
Someone got a link to this tales of equine proportions thing?
the 3DS price in that pic has ranged between anything from 159.99 to 229.99
and fall because the weather is nice for about a week before it turns cold.
Well here in Los Angeles we don't get seasons
they cant make up their minds
6A pondering and verbose tale of delightful equines
and thats in pounds btw
Prince-leverage yeah Ziltoid's up there
Spring is when I clamor to visit Tornado Alley.
And I have for the past 3 years.
6yes
We have heat and cold.... no seasons.
lol.
Roara: lolwhut at that picture
</late>
This was the first year I finally saw a tornado (or two?)
04LL
04Why does Cojiro look so mad X3
12wow...
12Chime
ya'll still here?
04?
6eeyup
i've never seen a tornado in person.
12I did something worse than you
sillies
Happened on the same day as the Joplin monster. It was a storm in central OK.
12and because he's lonely
04orly
12yah
04worse than not saving?
12I ran through the-ayup
04and :c that's why he's so blue
But I've been in one of the pre-tornado rotation thing. Its surreal.
/me FELES
Oh yeah.
04ran through the...
12da-ba-dee-da-ba-da
Wall cloud?
Funnel?
12I ran through the Shadow Temple
04.
12again
04AND YOU DIDN'T SAVE
04OWCH
12to find a key
Everything gets super still around you even though you can look out and see other trees moving. Then the wind picks up really bad.
04wait
04oh
04you had it
04already
12to open the final door before the Boss room
04that IS worse
12no
04oh?
12the door was ALREADY UNLOCKED
04.......
04BAHAHAHAHA
the rotation passed right over me but luckily no real tornado.
12no key needed
04That fails
o.o
lollol
Tornadoes can be down w/o the funnel touching down.
12THAT was the original OoT in my mind
04time to get big bass sward
04:3
04and k
12that door to get to the penultimate room
12needed a key in the original
04so the final door is unlocked
12:B
04good
really...?
I didn't see the one I caught on video touch down, but I saw the tree damage it did.
04see this is the bad part of Nintendo's Master Quest
that's interesting
04Locked doors should remain locked so people don't go insane
04like you XD
Tornadoes are not defined by the funnel.
12@-@
hmm. have you guys seen those water-tornadoes?
Which is called the condensation funnel.

03An elderly gentleman had serious hearing problems for a number of years. He went to the doctor and the doctor was able to have him fitted for a set of hearing aids that allowed the gentleman to hear 100%. The elderly gentleman went back in a month to the doctor and the doctor said, "Your hearing is perfect. Your family must be really pleased that you can hear again."
03The gentleman replied, "Oh, I haven't told my family yet. I just sit around and listen to the conversations. I've changed my will three times!"

a yogscast podcast has a good example of larping
although King's Rule larps use hit=delimb/kill style combat
i would be using a teaser if i was playing with my D&D friends
if of course we act our the scene which is rare at all
you know, since I have a bunch of larp friends, we could actually do that for any d&d games
I'd use THIS

03A friend of mine was visiting a college, which had those security call boxes every few hundred feet. If you were wandering around the campus at night and felt uneasy about somebody following you, for instance, you could hit the button and have a security officer come investigate immediately.
03On one of these phones hung a sign that said, "Out of Order."
03Underneath it someone had scrawled. . . "Keep Running!"
who has that kind of cash for larping gear?
oh only 4k, nothing to worry bout. i can get that in a few days. sure. yeah. /sarcasm
Lolwat
who has any money for that really
oh no
even if i made it myself

03He now lives happily ever after in Redmond, Wash., writing error messages for Microsoft.

that is for SCA, which is hardcore realism with dangerous, hard rubber weapons. You can break bones in that combat

03One of the youngsters pointed to a picture and asked if it really was the photo of a wanted person.
03"Yes," answered the policeman.
Or metls
03"Well," wondered the child, "why didn't you keep him when you took his picture?"

so is larping an all day thing?
at Kanar, plate is pretty popular. leather is most common though, for cost and lightness
depends really
14Wait
14Did Twilight Say that?
how expensive is LARPing?
14loop
for the most part, from what I've seen, Larping is a friday-Sunday thing, sometimes longer, sometimes a one day
14loop AGAIN
in Michigan, typically 25-30 an event, for rental fees or food
really?
I've seen a 50/3day game, but that covers a 10 dollar food fee, and that is very worth it
12o-o
14Go to Equestria Daily
03yeah that's where I was pasting them from
Is there like a rigid plastic material that you use? I feel like LARP weapons would be kinda flimsy
that sounds fun
it does...

check your youtube volume
Youtube volume's full.
Computer volume's full.
I've checked.
Stream volume's full.
jacky weakness is a room that is domed and no furniture in it
larp weapons that are purchased typically use fiber glass cores or use a material that is rigid in masas
home-made weapons often use fiber glass rods and PVC piping
>Implying Jackie Chan has any weaknesses
gravity?
he is a master but dood, think about how his fighting style works
and PVC pipe is common back when you where a kid
Ahh shit. Desktop crashed.
pvc is very cheap and common. i can get a 10 foot piece for 3 bucks
I need to look at it.

Billy's Balloon?
intimidating
that sounds about average price
the armor is hard to make
regardless of how light you make it
that suit is actually worth it, if bought piece-by-piece it would be more expensive
If I was making tons of money I'd spend it on stuff like that
also depends on the price of the metals
like in the market
XVX is a mac audio warez cracking group
it's mostly craftsmanship and leather that makes it costly
I'd assume so

The Weather Channel is full of morons now sans Greg Forbes and Jim Cantore.
Anyone else a fan of the Pinkie Pie?
Bane, why did that give me a boner?
Talk to any other weather enthusiast, and they'll agree.
im a fluttershy fan
I kind of wonder if the TV meteorologists on The Weather Channel even have meteorology degrees.

princess whats her name
best princess name ever
Yeah.
An ugly princess.
queen princess xD
i mean bee princess**
Against Queen Slug For A Butt.
xD yes
ya i miss that show....to bad it was so underrated
Queen or princes.
i forgot really
it was a queen of a hive or something
I know the name was Slug-for-a-butt.
i need to look back on it
i think it was queen, because she was laying eggs
x3
how else did she get her minions xD
And they considered Princess What's Her Name ugly.
There's Evil the Cat as well.
yes spitting acid hairballs
hey, anyone want to see a first-time writers attempt at a fanfic? I'm sure some kind critiquing would be appreciated by (presumably) him
shouldn't say attempt, it is a fanfic
sure
It's not your fanfic, is it?
bit short, moderatly cloppish
no it isn't
also again petter puppy, the best sidekick but the biggest double edge sword xD
*closes from trixi fanfic*
Aww it wants me to make an account.
14I G2G in 7 mins
I can do art (and writing), but it's not my main skill.
brb
oh, probably because it's a mature article
Are clopfics even allowed on dA?
yes, as are moderately pornographic images
They have very strict porn rules
but they need Adult tags, and they aren't visible without turnng off mature filters, which are member-only options
I don't read or want to read porn anyway.
back
ok, yeah, after getting halfway through, this is hardcore clopfic material
so... is dari asleep?
Can I spam LEVERAGE now?
sure, why the fuck not. remember there is an auto-kick on spamming though
there is
PFFT
