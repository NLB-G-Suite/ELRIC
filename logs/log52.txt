Angry Italians Yelling: The Movie
suddenly, everything is lagging...
I guess something's staringing my connection
it says you die... alot
Yes you do...
Husky is in this movie?
It has Permadeath but you can turn it off
4Dungeons of Dredmor looks...okay
And he laughs
No, not really, Its a rougelike
or rather a roguelike
hey, pinkie, it's fun!
roguelikes are awesome!
adom is great, but recently I've been getting into ToME
Dem cops
I played anband before I bought it to see if I'd like it
ToMe?
angband*

It's a bouncing baby gun!
Wut?
it has a huge world
Was that a bullet?
9god guys
but that of course means the world isn't very consistent though
4What's up?
still good fun
4Sucks
4Damn, this movie's going by fast today
1.5 hours?
derp
is it just me or is the movie going by quicker?
It is
4People have suggested Dungeons of Dredmor, but I'm not sold on it
Because no one is watching it
I suspsect it's because it's earlier, and we're more alert
Except when the SFX happens
Playing DoD Makes this movie go by fast
4Still
The DSII sound effect is helping, too
4I don't know yet
9ah, well
I guess it's because we're actually chatting and not just shouting in hope of getting noticed
6Civ III is pretty fun.
Well said, Elky.
Downloading DoD rightnow
>implying we're not shouting and hoping to be noticed
that be the truth

aargh
That was the best one yet
Don't you just use VAC?

6PENUCKLE
well once we get like 200+ people
looks interesting Elky, I'll give it a shot
Random sound for random scene

And we're not shouting about Leverage either
9I suppose I could get a mini-jack extension cable...
silvermane: have you played ADoM?
4Dungeons of Dredmor doesn't appear to be for me
Leverage is over rated
9and just plug them into the audio input instead
if not, try it first
Is there a way to put this on slow mode (can't post more than once in a minute or so)?
alright
ADoM? Ok, hat's that?
12bbl
it's like the best roguelike ever
Whom?
9yeah, pretty much
it doesn't have as much content, but it's very, very immersive
Ancient Domane of something?
You can do that with VAC.
9yeah
9I was trying to do that with VAC
Ancient Domains Of Mystery
Gotta get some food

every time
I've played it for ~3 years and only won once

Do you eat?
not with spells
You eat EVERYTHING
no seriously
The soundeffect has really lost its novelty and humour value. Just saying.
rezo: don't even joke about that
4Rezo clearly hasn't seen Deathstalker II
9like Castlevania on crack
9and that can only be a good thing
clearly
4I dunno
No subtitles?
we must educate him
10D:
clearly
BIZINISS
4Castlevania on crack may not be such a good thing
is this english
or italian
italian
Italian
I can't tell the difference with these guys
italiano
I think it's italian
The Room > Deathstalker II
Its time like this I wish I could understand Italian
(troll face.jpg)
the room was boring
This movire requires more subtitles.
The Room./
speaking of Room-level badness
6I'm going for a smoke.
has anyone seen Birdemic?

i think the point is to alienate us, the viewers, to tell us there's something we don't get to know about
see?
and that's bullshit

Dramatic music
but Fluttershy IS worst pony
Requires more dramatic music.
Authentic news
/me loves and tolerates the shit out of Elky's pony preferences
4@Elky: I gotta go to the bathroom
was this made before the spinning newspaper was a cliche
8Dash is best pony
7probably
8 /discussion
Prohibition law caused all of this
/me agrees with Elky, actually.
Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash are inferior ponies.
LOUD MUSIC IS LOUD
4ANNOYING TRUMPET
Rarity FTW
why isn't there any flute though?
Rarity is best pony
Rarity has the best voice actor
Rainbow and Pinkie FTW
another scene of people walking
Tabitha St. Germain is amazong
4Darf14: Wrong, Ashleigh Ball is best voice actress
Rarity > Twilight > the other four ponies.
4Though, I do like Tara Strong
I like 'em all
10brb
I like them all but those two are my favorites
everybody likes them all, but we like arguing more
ohyou.jpg
Not that there's anything particurally wrong with her
Fluttershy broke the 4th wall
How could anyone not like Rarity? :(
quiet the manchild please
when did Fluttershy break the fourth wall?
"Always Works!"
"Always works," SilverMane
yeah, i don't remember that
He gave birth to a baby
oh
Has the Domestic violence scene already happened?
really? that's the best you got? Pinkie Pie grabbed the closing screen and exited the show to talk to us once
isn't this all domestic violence?
4It could have been just a way to assert herself
06Nom
they are a FAMILY after all
4To show that she's right to herself
By domestic violence, do you mean a long, hard, bare bottomed hairbrush spanking for a naughty and disobedient wife?
6Back
There are lots of reasons to approve of rarity, even outside of her two key episodes.
No i mean Belt whipping
7wb
Modfoals can't soonforce. :P
Rarity, honestly, has the best episodes that focus on her
More than 20% cooler
10idk, i still dont like rarity :P
Rarity gained alot of points for me during Suited for Success but the WA HA HA sealed it
silvermane is right, y'know
Rarity isn't snooty, she's /artistic/
8DAT RACISM
which is why Rarity is third best pony
inb4 Rarity in bondage
/me grabs pen and paper
clopclopclop
where?
Dash isn't arrogant.
>dat flankspank
EVERYWHERE
Does she know any shame?
Silvermane/Rarity porn
it's not shame, it's dignity
hi Espeon
She makes dresses for living, but is naked all the time!
just throwing it out there
Dash is a bogstandard jock character with a mild asshoel streak, the likes of which exist by the millions.
Good Gravy! They are all naked!
A WELL DONE character of that type, but still.
" Having or revealing an exaggerated sense of one's own importance or abilities" < definition. There's notthing more imporant than Dash, and no one is as skilled as her, therefore not arrogant.
Just imagine them all in their underwear
oh, wait.
nothing*
celestia is never naked
Elky, DO IT
Applejack is the only not-naked pony thanks to her hat
suddenly we are in Italy
silvermane, I'll ask /co/
Applejack's rural-ness shows, yes.
And suddenly we have subtitles
06hii
And before we didnät
they'll do anxthing if I say it'll piss ponychan of
Silly you
arent they in Sicily?
It was a slow day. Rarity idly passed the fabric through her sewing machine, watching the stitches slip in and out.

4That's why
french, because SilverMane
4So we're entertaining ourselves
Like it actually is someone trying to tell a story
I sometimes even forget we're watching the Godfather
Because everypony wants to ship with SilverMane.
The movie has it boring parts, but it is still a good movie
lol
I don't want...
It's a forgettable movie. Live-written clop fiction isn't.
I'll have to watch this movie alone... I honestly can't pay attention while clopping to SilverManexrarity clopfiction

this is the 3rd time I've seen someone write a shipper live
I don't know why this has never happened before!
inb4 she bondage rapes him
"Oh, there it is!" Rarity picked up her measuring tape, turning around.
"Now, I'm just missing one thing-"
"aha!"
10But SilverMane, I...
>measuringt tape...
her horn glowed as she magically lifted her incredibly stylish designing glasses onto her nose.

"Oh, don't be silly, darling, it's all for the art." Rarity stretched the tape out.
I'm only here for Leverage, really.
06hitting it with the forklifter is awesome, with a lot of mess afterwards :P

10^win
She is jumping to conclusions
SilverMane: I just stated the fact that Males>Females. In sexiness.
MY FAVORITE SCENE!
NEEEEEEVER
what's awkward about the godfather? If you ignore the live my little pony clopfic, it's perfectly fine!
"Look, maybe I should just go..." Pizzapony stepped off the modeling platform.
BAF FUNG GU!

8DSII

Pizzapony sighed. "I've seen enough hentai to know where this is going."
This makes no sense.

6Trust me.
6I am.
and I still wouldn't understand them

I am recording this entire conversation, for the annals.
4Don Corleone and Rooster Codburn, now THAT'S an awesome duo
Rarity looked around, frantically. She magically opened her closet and stuffed Pizzapony inside.
"Uh, just a minute!"
the old closet trick? nice...
and that is how i died
Someone must post this on /oat/ and EqD after this is done
I thought it said chest

"Oh, uh, nothing, Sweetie..." Rarity said, nervously eyeing the closet.

Twilight blushed. "Um,

Fluttershy nodded. "Oh, that's okay, Rarity, I'll come back later." She turned around and slunk off.

a yogscast podcast has a good example of larping
although King's Rule larps use hit=delimb/kill style combat
i would be using a teaser if i was playing with my D&D friends
if of course we act our the scene which is rare at all
you know, since I have a bunch of larp friends, we could actually do that for any d&d games
I'd use THIS

03A friend of mine was visiting a college, which had those security call boxes every few hundred feet. If you were wandering around the campus at night and felt uneasy about somebody following you, for instance, you could hit the button and have a security officer come investigate immediately.
03On one of these phones hung a sign that said, "Out of Order."
03Underneath it someone had scrawled. . . "Keep Running!"
Lolwat
oh no
even if i made it myself
ahhhhhh

We watched the whole spider film earlier.
that is for SCA, which is hardcore realism with dangerous, hard rubber weapons. You can break bones in that combat
