Celestia`s_Bunny: Example. Gamestop wont hire young'ins
Mega_Milk: oh
GilDash: You're implying I haven't done the same thing. If I'm lucky I at least get an answer that says "no"
Frendchips_666: You don't have to be if you don't want to
how are things Friendchips_666
Heya Frendchips_666

The dialouges?
Celestia`s_Bunny: Calm down.
Frendchips_666: anyway, did you read the rules?
Meanwhile: the only way to get noticed on the jobmarket is to stand on the balls of the guy who's reading the applications
Meanwhile: Have you been to the jobs center at all? Applied to agencies? Used a different CV for each application? Done volunteer work? Considered further education? Considered an apprenticeship?
How I get 666 out of my name
Meanwhile: get on their nerves

00,10bummer
GilDash: I've been going to the Job center for like, 10 months. And every fortnight they shrug at me and say come back in two weeks. My CV has been through a dozen rewrites at the behest of these people, I don't work for free, I've failed further education 3 times, and apprenticeships have the same problem.
Sumica: we still welcome YOUR playthrough though
Then type "/nick Friendchips", new. But without the quotation marks.

Oh you Pinkie :D
Hahaha
Wow
Howdy Serenity.
Ha, oh Pinkie. :D
Meanwhile: You might want to consider volunteer work regardless. Also, I never found the Job Center any good at all. I got my job through an agency called Ranstad. They not only helped me with my CV, but gave me an interview prep as well. I'd advise you take a look.
wtf
Her Pinkie sense answered that.
PINKIE IS ABLE TO MOVE THROUGH DIMENSIONS
Ermagerd, Erm ah nerd.
Meanwhile: Randstad, sorry.

He is going nucking futs

hi Blueflare
So if he did it with her.....would it be incest....or masturbation......
And than what? What is your purpose after that? You're probably walking to your demise!
This fact occured to me after 2 weeks of attempting to design a kickass capital ship for 40k
did it work?7
good luck MadSurge :3
nope
cause it's you on you...so...
i didi it wrong
Mega_Milk: or simply clone sex
Mega_Milk: no idea...
Meanwhile: That doesn't help anyone, least of all you. If you're not willing to explore all possibilities then you're going to find the search harder.
I Have A Question
GilDash: Who cares.
Sounds somewhat like Terry O'Quinn.
Laurayne: yesh?
Meanwhile: Conisidering I'm trying to help, me, obviously.
Ask away Laurayne :)
GilDash: Well knock it off. It's bugging me.
Meanwhile: Not my style I'm afraid.
Oh jeez, confusing pathos.
lol Guilt trip
I'm leaving now. This anime isn't capturing my interest

what's with the tiny jacket?
Laurayne: WAT IS THOU QUESTION!
If You Had A Portal Gun, And Fired Two Portals On Objects Faceing WEach Other, Then Moved Them Really Close, What Would Happen In The Object Is Too Big And Tries To Go Threw Several Times?
His jacket doesnt even cover the lower portion of his torso...
Laurayne: MY MIND IS MALFUNCTIONING!!!

Squallken: um...it's kind of ridiculous
Squallken: its name
NINA

I HATE THAT character
alright, who wants to earn 50$ worth of steam stuff?
Lyra`: me
dibs!
delivered in 3 days
depends, what is it
Lyra`: depends on what I have to do...
code geass is one of the best animes ive seen, probably the best
second question, who has the capabilities to send a starving girl roughly 20$ of pizza?
:D
Lyra`: not me
dibs!
lol Lyra`
wait no, my pizza! :3
oh the hell with it, this anime 10?10
I have the money but no way to send it :(
if you meet both requisits, PM me

00,10and what would said girl do in return? =p
damn
Lyra`: i will get u a pizza
it really is a good deal
Lyra`: but i leave in mexico so it will arrive in a week or two
Lyra`: SuperBrony64 has pizza
live*
thats roughly 150% return on your investment
Lyra`: Why not just save said money for yourself?
and im always honest when it comes to money and agreements
SONJA
because im broke, but i get paid 1000$ in three days
and i have no bills till the payday after that
bad choice of words to say to the blind girl
I would If I could :3
Lyra`: So why don't you save said money for financial use?
back with toast
i did, but it was all taken by my damn phone company
I want to hug Nunnally sometimes
orange-kun
and they have yet to resolve the issue
Lyra`: How much do they charge you? :S
Rather, I feel like I want to hug her :$
Jeramiah is a bad-ass in R2
00,10Jeramaya gotswald, the most loyal MF in all of creation
they charged me about 1600 last time
when my bill is about 160
Sumica: 100% orange, 200% MOTHERBUCKING LOYALTY
Sumica: until the 3rd series at least
and they wont givve it back till the end of next month D:<
00,10if r3 ever comes out
Lyra`: Have you considered changing to a different phone company?
wow, what jerks
anyway, can anyone take me up on my offer?
YOURE NOT SEEING THE ISSUE HERE AJIsAwesome
sorry Lyra`, I would if I could :P but I cant :(
Lyra`: You could take legal action for that kind of thing. :S
I'm just trying to help in any way I can.
i would but i dont have Paypal :S
booooooooooooooooooooo
I'm just giving advice.
im not that worried, theyre giving it back eventually
the issue here, AJIsAwesome, is that im hungry and broke
Lyra`: sell food, problem solved!

DaringDerpy, thats what I thought...
Evening, all. Stanidn by on the Boston coast for some wind and fun.
Brad_: I'm guessing because the pigs anre't capable of living on their own. They aren't really capable of defencding themselves like earth ponies.
AJIsAwesome, but that be fluttershy's job.
Hi, OtakuTom, DaringDerpy, and ASoftFluffyThing. :)

That's a mace, not a moring star.
a Morning star has a chain connected to the spiked ball
cachi01: hmm maybe...Sketch Toku....idk doesnt roll off the tounge like Sketch LoveNote or but it may grow on me :)
dont argue with the videogame!
I Know :I
Sketch_Toku_Brony: just name it like you want :) i just named my oc cachi like me lol
thelonepony: Actually a morning star is just a spiked mace
if I had a secret vault, I would secure it with a 20 digit code lock. statues are for posers
a mace like weapon with a chain is called a flail
DONT ARGUE WITH THE VIDEOGAME
cachi01: yeah :$ maybe Sketch just by itself :D

Still works

O.o
Sumica: were is that from?
Kurra: Ah. Thank you. :)
Assassin's Creed with Guns and fire
this just looks epic
Master_of_War: assassins creed has guns and fire...
It doesn't have AK-47s
Master_of_War: its kinda stupid if you compare uncharted to AC.
they are completely different
yeah
He's using parkour to solve puzzles.
Assassin's Creed
he is using a un
I don't know much more than the first AC, and it was rather boring. I've heard they have greatly improved
one is a action game with exploration elements
he is using a gun
cod
yh the first AC sucked
the second however was GREAT
That is what my cousin tells me
I have yet to play Brotherhood on my comp
agreed cachi01 its like comparing MLP to Indiana Jon- damn it Daring Doo! :D
AC1 had an epic storyline but was repetitive as repetative as repetative as crap.
yeah the thing with AC is that it was VERY repetitive
lol
herdmind
AC2 took me 35 hours to finish
i've never completed AC1...its the only AC i havent completed in less than 3 days
and I'm only part way through Brotherhood
I almost.. ALMOST gave up on ... holy crap, this game is intense
and haven't done revelations
well nate. u r a lucky son of a bitch
O.o
yep
told u lucky
THIS IS JUST WORSE!
Yeah. AC was an endurance test, I'd say
Take a lesson from Indiana jones - just shoot him.
Is Uncharted on the PC?
hey every pony whats better ps3 or xbox
flutter_spin: ps3 exclusive
It's all a matter of preference.
figures.
All the good games are exclusives
therainbowvortex: imo they are both good =
therainbowvortex: Gonna open that can of worms,, huh...
console wars is just a stupid thing........ U R GAMERS FOR OD SAKE STFU AND JUST PLAY
lol mandopony is so funneh
PC better. Can I say that?
god*
Sabershy: yes yes i am i have my opion i wana hear yours
does anyone have Uncharted 2? always wanted to have some matches w/ some bronies :)
yeah pc is way better than consoles but they are all good
I've taken a lesson from Indiana Jones while assassinating the Bordga captians in Brotherhood - I just shoot them with my arm cannon thing.
SO much easier.
I have no idea what I was doing before I clicked on the Bronystate bookmark and I don't care anymore.
flutter_spin: watching porn maybe?
:D
A little bit of Mechwarrior Online and Professor Layton
oh and Hawken
mechwarrior and proffesor layton porn?
Honestly, I am a gamer that has no preference. I have favorites on all consoles. The only thing is that I have more play time on my XBox360 thanks to halo and CoD. Especially when november comes.
.......
lol cachi01 thats what i was thinking
Nate has better grip than wanderer
God, this game makes me think back tot he first TOmb Raider and how SLOW and easy it seems now.
Nate has better grip than Spider-man...
Its like Dragon's Dogma. Why can't I play it on the PC?
SpeccyRush: :O man now i wanna get the Ico/SotC collection :D
/me has never played ico or sotc :(

I went into the game knowing nothing and was blown away what I was supposed to do.
really?
huh...
Uncharted?
I have no idea how fast that game was anyway XDDD
I guess you just expect something to go wrong every 5 seconds
This is like TOmb Raider crossed with Dragon's Lair.
Yep, Spider-Man is Nate, not Peter parker.

That sucks.

eddmario: how old are you?
geeky: This is how he usually ends his streams
eddmario: ok
geeky: Recording.
Infernap12: I turned 20 a couple of weeks ago,. Why?
AJIsAwesome: sad face
Thanks for the stream
ahhh the recycled mother 3 stream
is often very disruptive in a younger persons life
11,02geeky: It's a recording right now.
NewSuperBronyU: ok
not that it sucks any less
Meh, I have an uncle who has 4 kids, all of them pretty young, and he went through a divorce a couple years ago. His kids don't really seem like it affected them at all.
but it did deep down
and it will come out later on in life
i though i was unaffected
*thought
It just depends on how mature you are when it happens. The oldest one, Luke, is actually pretty mature for his age.
So, who's next for streaming?
eddmario, and the youngest one?
See ya NewSuperBronyU
ASS ASINES CREED

What's the weirdest question you ever had to answer when registering a piece of hardware?
it consists of 4 groups of numbers ranging from 0000 to 9999
or is it 5
So, are we switching steamers or is NewSuperBronyU just really board as fuck?
11,02What are you poniez talking about?
???
Stuff >_.
I HAVE NO IDEA! - The Medic, TF2
>_>*
eddmario: :D
Combat medic is best medic \:3/
Is this that game where the final boss is a fetus that you have to give an abortion?
NewSuperBronyU: it was Slurry right?
11,02It's Slurry
That's Earthbound.
That is Mother 3
Or is this the game where the pirated copies are harder and crash before the end, deleting your save file?
AdamTheDuck: is the best duck
No I ish best carnivorous duck
eddmario: Both of your questions atr related to Earthbound. This game being streamed is Mother 3, the sequel.

Kencolt, sleep is for the weak /)
00,10you have not watched much anime then Kencolt
twilight_sprinkle: he's not memetic for nothing
00,10cause she is fucked up
Sumica: I have been watching anime since 1966. And this is STILL the most bucked up ever in my opinion.
damn you are old son
^
Surely there's someone else better than the kid though, he's never used it before?
00,10I think madoka blose this out of the water.
Kencolt, you mean 1996?
Sumica: and it's less pretentious too
00,10there is a maguffen that prevents most from being able to pilot it
Kencolt being the eldest... why is this a still a surprise?
Kandarihu: No. I'm 55 in Novenber. I meant 1966.
Kencolt, wow. Cool
WHY is this such a hard idea for everypont to GET?
00,10cause old men are not supposed to like ponies I guess
:D
AdamTheDuck: Only children born (or concieved- it's nebulous) during Second Impact can pilot.
THUNDERBIRDS ARE GO
00,10oh and they are electric dari.
What, the robots?

MadSurge, you'll understand later...
MadSurge, although I don't think they explain it in the rebuild
aw crap, battery on the player ran out
time to think about why hes there and stuff now
The rebuild only goes through the first 5 or so episode, doesn't it? The full explanation isn't until MUCH later in the series

Phase4 rarity's dream
An angel
XD
00,10the death of mankind
Phase4, and "angel" trying to kill humanity.
why?
never liked geometry
an *
coool angel though
Do they know why the angels want to kill them?
Phase4: Because Angels are from science and outer space and hate humens.
but yeah, geometry is evil
Science :<
00,10the why is never covered
Sumica, interpretations >.<
The idea is "God is pissed"
^
Yup
00,10think of it as a game of capture the flag
Even though God doesn't look so omnipotent in this anime
00,10nerv curently has the flag and the angles are trying to get it back
Powerful, yes, but not omnipotent
Sumica, I see what you did there >.>
Snoiper
Maybe God's an alien overlord in this universe
^dat
^^ lolwut
And he sent the angels to punish humanity
Rainbow drill~
Geometry will be the drill that pierce the earth!
yay killed chat
00,10train = ego trip
Geometry killed the chat
/me stabs TheGreatAndPowerfulT with a progressive knife
00,10or is it his ID
00,10I forget which

Sumica, sorta spoiling it >.>
^
dat instrumentality
00,10they have spoken of instrmantality
Oh have they?
Ok then
yeah but i had no idea what the instrumentality meant .-.
Rei is so chill about it all o_o
this is 1.1, theres also 2.2 right?
*1.11 2.22
That's my theory why God is pissed. Instrumentality.
twilight_sprinkle, eeyup, and 3 is coming out soon
So are the robots actually alive, or what?
00,103.33 is in thearders already
Whaaaaaaa?
How did I miss that?

Ahh ok
So Rebuild is a slightly abridged retelling of Evangelion?
always teh first~
00,10it's a rebuild
cuz they awsum
00,101.11 is close to orignal
MadSurge, yeah, there's nothing added compared to 2.22
00,102.22 is vastly diffrent
^
Ah
00,10might show
Does Shinji man up by any chance?
00,10have not decided yet
Is it a good different or a bad different?
define man up
MadSurge: still movie three to see
Gold_Demona, not really good or bad, it's like a whole new story in a way.
hm
SpeccyRush: at least stop whining and cry about daddy

It should be in Castlevania
Da fuck is an impact?
poke him witha pointed stick and see what happens shinji
poor dabi , he is so confus
oh, just an attack huh
Some kind of catastrophe I think
twilight_sprinkle, not sure, could be explosion as well
Like I said, interpretations >.<
i actually only saw bits of this movie last time it was streamed..
do the cooking by the book, shinji
00,10you mussent run away
So how exactly is Lilith "the key to all life/humanity"?
00,10magic *snort snort*
So they don't explain it

00,10not yet any ways
twilight_sprinkle, 14 I think
00,10kids are 14
I just came back and-- o////o

Polydunami, XD
The way I understand it, Lillith is where everything came from.
00,10No presure shinji
That penguin will be the savior of humanity
PenPen for president
Yeah, I was watching Lost :P
imma let you finish shinji, but no pressure aight, just dont mess up, whatever you do
He was blatantly going with the classic "we're about to die, end of the world sex"
SpeccyRush: who is that guy anyway?

No pressure. >.>
00,10enemy spy in the base
Who was the genius that said "I have an idea! let's make the pilots FEEL the damage of their robots!"
MadSurge, it's so that one can controll the EVA.
MadSurge: There's a reason for it
MadSurge: thats what i was thinking although maybe they didnt have a choice
00,10well they are hooked directly in to the spine of the mech
^
JUST USE JOYSTICKS, those look easy
USE THE WII
MadSurge: Yeah, but in order for the joysticks to work, they have to be directly connected with the eva's nervous system.
PUSH THE BUTTON :[
it farted
Ewwww
Mawr blood \:3/
It's raining blood! D:
00,10always a rainbow
So is this some kind of angel fluid?
bloody rainbows
A robot with nervous system? They're digging their own grave deeper and deeper
MadSurge: I told you. They're not really robots
00,10I hope rai's eva is off
00,10otherewise she just felt that
Push little button. :3
It's not like she gives much of a damn

That's not a launch, that's an airdrop.
Although I did like the original introduction of Asuka. :/

iT'\S A BIRD!
Finally, someone who likes to beat up Shinji
no?
MadSurge, XD
I've heard what Asuka is like.
i see
Alright, I better start on my homework
00,10it's a triple rainbow
Someone ping me when the space angel attacks
All the way
WATCH AND LEARN SHINJI
What an arrogant little brat
Polydunami: not as Trixie
Surely if there were only something like 10 angels to start with, they're running out of angels to kill
^
Shikinawi? Not Soryu?
00,10that was number 7
00,106 more to go
00,10ah, that was number 3
00,10at the start of this
Sumica: so they captured both 2 and 3?
ehh screw the homework
I'll do it tomorrow XD
00,10yep
00,10lol
00,10the key to morphuses ship
Mmhmm. Heard of Instrumentality as well.
-_(\
Sexy tiem
hahahaha AdamTheDuck :D what is the homework
mica
There was a little explanation for the "key", can't remember it though
lol
JEALOUS
00,10the key was not the key in the show
00,10it was "Adam"
Sumica, not just that, but a metaphor behind it too
no Ex Boyfriend I guess
metaphor, not sure if that's the right word
Sumica: That was one thing that confused the hell out of me in the original. They called the thing Adam, but then when Kaoru went down there, he called it Lillith.
Who is an idiot here? :|
00,10adam is the small thing in the case
Asuka + Shinji moments <3
00,10lillith is angle number 2
im pretty sure asuka's a lich
00,10she is many things
They removed the co-operation episode didn't they>
?*
That was a strange one anyway >.>

Pen Pen is best eva pilot
^
i agree ^
Hand pupet
wat
00,10all pilots have loads of mental issues
like every single character in this series
including pen pen
Oh, she actually shows some of her mental issues early on
She already has.
daddy wasn't there to take me to the fair
Oh man I forgot about this song!
<3
So much <3 from me today :$
pretentious soundtrack is a go ?
This?
Plane... flying underground... wat
I really liked the coverbeer in the first movie.
so this is rap music O_O
And the whole way it was handled.
00,10luna has been busy.
i agree ^
You mean the censorbeer?
^
Does ANYONE from this show NOT have mental issues?
Polydunami, yeah. That was awesome
oooooh that's what the EVAs are made of...
00,10pen2 is fine
MadSurge: I don't think so
Pen pen is best pony!
Having seen what they call 'angels'
That guy can breathe in space!
I don't even wanna think about God.
MadSurge: He's special
Angels are messengers of God... So does that mean God's message is death? :/
AdamTheDuck: Eeyup
Seems to be, in this show at least.
EXTREME DECONTAMINATION :D
YAAAAY FISHES
But it's only a bloody movie.
they are now steril
and then Pen Pen eat all the fish
^
Rainbow is the covenant symbol of God's promice to never destroy earth.
translation ... Tonight brother penguines we rebel !!!!!
AdamTheDuck: so RD is Jesus? :D
AdamTheDuck, yeah, the producers really don't understand God at all.
00,10how did she get her game in there?
Yet it appears after every angels attempts to destroy earth
But this is a movie.
Sumica like how prisoners get hpones in to a prison :D :D
Symbolism >.>
Sumica hammerspace or she hidde it somewhere
Am I overthinking this? :$
AdamTheDuck: God tells many jokes
00,10oh she had it in her "pocket"
Victoria's secret compartment?
^ .-.
So did the movie show Shinji accidentally knocking Rei over? :3
00,10yeah
Polydunami, eeyup
00,10and his grope
Oh wow
And her "reaction" afterward.
00,10there was even a rainbow like when they take out an angle
Miso soup is SO GOOD.
00,10behold second impact
Why u mispell so much angel Sumica
00,10cause it's 3 am
It's 6am over here. XD
I just drank 8 cup of Miso tonight. i think's cleamed me out :( sorry that's probably TMI
So second impact is a rainbow crater?
MadSurge, seems that way :P
Suddenly cut away to flash back
And this after I watched Lost :|
00,10more issues then rolling stone
more issues than sports illustrated
In the End they all died for the last slice of pizza
^
00,10who wanted to know when this angel came up?
More of this James Bond ripoff track? :3
Sumica, don't worry, I stopped doing my homework again :P
00,10ahhh
Polydunami: Are you sure you're not thinking of the Mission Impossible theme?
Night yall talk to you guys in the morning ok and thanks for the stream sumica sleep tight yall
This is unrealistic! There's no way EVERYONE has daddy/mommy issues! :D
00,10later Moopy
Goodnight Moopy
No, I'm pretty sure this has at least some inspiration from a theme from the James Bond movies.
MadSurge: They would if everyone who survived is insane. XD
00,10mass evac
AutoBots Roll ....sorry wrong movie
Gold_Demona: "the future is too silly, better die now!"
lol
Pfft, 99%? You and your fancy mathematics.

Have to make breakfast... But don't want to miss anything...
Dammit, I want to go to bed :S
Gold_Demona, stay for this attack, it's my favouite one :3
But this.
/me hits Polydunami with a spoon "Sleep is for the weak" :|
So what's special about this new angel?
00,10it's falling from space
MadSurge, teamwork \:3/
"No sleep" is for the weak.
Sumica: EXTREME CANNONBOOOOOOMB
we can all sleep when we are dead i try to live life to the full Polydunami :D :D
ION CANNON READY

they should shut down all sensors and make it a 1 in a million shot
PSYCHEDELIC EYEBALL :D
Didn't Eva Unit 00 used to be blue? Or am I remembering it wrong?
Gold_Demona, yeah that's why I asked earlier why they changed its colour
Gold_Demona: Shinji's? No, always purple
MadSurge: No, that's 01. I'm asking about 00. Rei's eva
MadSurge, no Shinji's is Unit 1

Oh god, if 4kids dubbed Eva...
...
00,10enter, the auto pilot
The world really WOULD end
Gold_Demona: it would be 10 miutes tops
Gold_Demona: only an 1/8th of an episode would be alowed to be shown
MISATO
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR VOICE?!
Bronysith: not even that
she drunk
Misato, go home. Yur drunk.
my god
why does asuka sound like a 40 year old woman?
Bronysith: Because she's whispering. :P
Bronysith you know technically twilight sparkle should too...
Same with Monkey D. Luffy.
Good morning everyone :)

Hello Colt_Brovakiin
Hey there, Colt_Brovakiin

Hiyo Colt_Brovakiin
man i love the rebuild movies
00,10and they put asuka in unit 3 instead of the guy that punched shinji
Good thanks alexxm. you? :)
Bronysith, I thought you said you didn't like Evangelion :P
Oh no
AdamTheDuck: i gave it another chance
I love this part XD
i'm good Colt_Brovakiin
AdamTheDuck: i gave it another chance cause i have an open mind like that man
It's like "trolololol, you thought we were going to put Shinji's friend didn't you viewers?" :D
00,10so yeah from this point on shit goes sideways
^
Hmm?
00,10oh and test suit, ohmai
lol ikr
Fanservice
i've watched this movie at least three times and i still don't understand a thing that happened
Who's she talking to
her doll
MadSurge, phone
I did :(
Ah
https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1351507168373.jpg
00,10oh look her emotonal scars are healing
oh god
EVA suits
Dem plug suits
Sumica: why is she so angry at herself?!
everythings gonna be alright Sumica
isn't that true of all eva suits
Shit got real \:3/
Uuuum
Well, then.
MadSurge: If I understand correctly, she blames herself for her mom's suicide.
Oh I love how they remade this attack <3
wat
Gold_Demona, that's a bit ahead in the series isn't it?
What...Has just happened
^
stop staring gendo
00,10unit3 was an angel
AdamTheDuck: He keeps asking questions. :P
Ah, it's not a big deal.
wat
Sumica: WHAT?! And they didn't realize there was one extra robot?!
Crush Kill Destroy Sawg
00,10they tryed to make it with angel tech
GREAT IDEA <_<
00,10to remove the need for power cords
so did they make a new angel then
https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1351503654094.jpg hahaha
I wonder why they decided to put Asuka in the suit and not Toji?
Bronysith: :D
Gold_Demona, to troll the viewers :$
Evangelion is definetely one of the best animes out there
Bronysith, such a change in heart :3 /)
God is like "These humans are idiots, I don't even have to do anything after all!"
00,10Gold_Demona cause toji did't have the ass for a test plugsuit
so are the angels aliens or something
Sumica: it's all in the pl,ot aint it?
alexxm, nope...
Sumica: LOL Neither does Shinji. :D
What what human arms what
AdamTheDuck great old ones?
alexxm, ehh might as well spoil it?...
alexxm, Well...
Sumica: teehee
where can i get Gendo glasses ? do i have to join the league of evil genius ?
00,10and now lets play unfiting music
<3 this unfitting song
So they can pilot remote them?! Why don't they do that in the first place?
I'm not surprised.
MadSurge: You'll see.
Damnit Sumica, no lyrics translations?
There
Songs goes like "Lets fly away together" or something like that
I suppose putting Asuka in there makes the emotional struggle a little more dramatic. =/
00,10oh and shinji cant see any of this, but he can hear and feel it.
Eyo
Sumica: oh hey, do you have phantasy star online blue burst? if not, want a link for the download?
Hello HavokOC
Hey AdamTheDuck :P
how are things HavokOC
HES EATING HER
00,10and the same goes for asuka
Giant guts
Hope you weren't hungry. :D
Things are good alexxm
AND THEN HES GOING TO EAT ME
Sumica: but is she fine or what?
Oh, so they moved the Unit 01 eating the angel thing to this one.
well asukas ded
MadSurge: nope

Wait, I thought Asuka lasted longer than that?
Yay, a sumistream :D

Dari: I don't think they can stop it until it finishes its "mission".
Why do that?
https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1351495763403.png
Alternatively, everyone gripped the stupid ball too hard
00,10shiji mad

Emooooooooo
Bronysith, it's easier to convey feeling when people are shouting than when they are speaking with their indoor voice.
whiny emo
alexxm: ITS EVANGELION
Sorry, I don't find Shinji sympathetic, I find him obnoxiously whiny.

so they can willingly go beserk now?
in season 3.. there is a mica
AdamTheDuck: Nope. I've only ever seen the regular series and End of Eva
what is this called?
alexxm, no, only Unit 2 was able to do so.
alexxm: if you're willing to suffer major pain, yes
damn thats a powerful at field
but she does have a missle
emotion?
Isn't THAT the angel that Unit 01 ate in the original series?
Off with the arm
oh hey shinji is actually going to be badass in a minute
Gold_Demona, eeyup

and now shinji is badass
suddenly cajones
http://imgur.com/HPh7e also this happened =_=
YAY
Shinji now badass for life and eternity
Why
Let everyone die
They're all pricks
gendo is unimpressed
No fucks given once again >.>
00,10cause it killed his woman
inb4 badassness
Sumica: but thats not kaworu
Gendo never gives a fuck unless Rei is involved.
In a way, this isn't him growing a spine. It's Shinji going back on a promise. The only time he grew a spine is when he became a consientious objector and resigned. So now that he's going back on his resignation, he's losing any sense of moral integrity.
shinji=badass
in a moment
Badass Shinji is badass.
Welp they screwed-wait
DO IT SHINJI
CUT HIS FREAKING HEAD OFF

He's just a kid in a robot, I don't even
MadSurge: an EVA is not a robot
MadSurge, it's not a robot >.>
MadSurge: the armor is meant to keep the eva under control
You are wrong Shinji
MadSurge, it's actually cloned angels being restricted and controlled

seriously, end of evangelion ends so badly

/me agrees with Bronysith

Goodnight Sumica
Sumica: thank you so much brao
Gold_Demona: also, you interested in playing phantasy star online blue burst?
Bronysith, /)
Bronysith: Not really
00,10so gonna regret this come "morning'
Gold_Demona: yea no
Gold_Demona: prepare for assimilation
ANYONE interested in playing phantasty star online blue burst? i can give you a link
I'll keep to my first person shooter :3
/me murders AdamTheDuck
you mean in the afternoon Sumica?
So at the end of that episode
And with that
Time for TF2
Who is actually dead?
its 43 outside this morning :S

Serenity regardless, you'd still complain
How is she not dead?
/me is a morning person
/me is sick
:3
Midnight_Stormwing: ha
/me Glomps RaveBrony
Mutterguy: I wouldn't. In ye olde Britain, it's almost freezing outside
That sucks, Midnight_Stormwing D:
My thermometer reads 2
Serenity: Isn't it always :)
/me hugs Ponies47
:'( 38 with the wind....I dont wanna go outside
and everyone in the world turns to delicious tang
So really
At the end of all that.
ooohhh 20 degrees tomorrow and it's ognna get hotter
What has actually happened is nothing.
Entirely nothing.
I don't get Farenheight, it sounds really exaggerated
I have no idea how bad it is outside today because I don't give a flying feather :P
They just want to confuse you, and make you think that something has happened.
^^^^^^^
which means what?
They're one step closer to something happening.
Doesn't mean anything has happened.
Oh good, something might happen sometime soon, soonish, sooner than it was soon previously.
Instrumentality is action of destroying all of the past life, destroying the past world and remaking it in the way they want
Everyone becoming one and remaking the world, essentially becoming God
They killed another giant monster. And then symbolism. Cue credits. :|
ZUm in fairness does surviving the battle ofBritian counts as nothing? because that's what's been going on
are you fucking kidding me
Fine something did happen, they killed some big things, which changed absolutely nothing.
Hmm?
everyone and their mother knows what evangelion is
action for actions-sense, no plot-dev?
I didn't watch so I don't know
Guys, if you lot are gonna argue and debate, take it to the deathmatch arena
oooh... deathmatch
me gusta
Vivix: the rebuild movies seemed to focus more on action instead of character development
Not arguing.
^^
Vivix, it's not like there's no plot, just most of the anime is watching the characters change and develop, and overcoming their mental issues.
My brain is trying to work out what just happened.
Enough robot bullshit, I want ponies now
you guys were showing the movies?
MadSurge: O u
And the result it's come up with is nothing.
Aah
ooh...Celebrity Deathmatch?
Entirely nothing...
^
Remember though, not everything is for everyone
Bronysith: Still gonna be at least 12 hours before he goes to beddy byes, I presume it'll be out of mind by then
What's there to be confused about? Nothing has happened.
*it in
Serenity: after i finished the original series, i dreamt i was an EVA pilot
RaveBrony, they were explaining the meaning of what happened at the very end.
Ah :P
Midnight_Stormwing: What was bothering me was how well they'd masked the fact that nothing had happened.
The only part that by itself doesn't make sense was explained as it was happening.
Midnight_Stormwing: you sick today, so no class for you...i still have to go
With all sorts of crazy shit to divert your attention.
From the fact that nothing happened.
Oooook
i did too
i wish i didnt have to go to school... but im not that sick... not dying yet...
Gold_Demona: Mind your 'ookin' launguage
XD
nope, I've cracked it.
I've got this shit.
/me hands Gold_Demona a banana
Midnight_Stormwing: thats the spirit
RaveBrony: Nope.
Ah, i see
I've seen something like 4 probably.
Huh- me too
Well it was
and this is why i dont talking in mane chat anymore... random arguments or 'discussions' about something completely irrelevant... =,=
Nope
Hello

/me explodes
He turned into a God for about 5 seconds before some guy stopped him, resulting in nothing happening overall
This is the reason I don't watch many animes though, a lot of them tend to make no sense to me- and just end up not interesting me

Ohai Resonantwaves :P
None of the characters actually died in the end
Midnight_Stormwing: they just streamed the movie though?
hiya :D
All that happened was some big things died, which doesn't affect anything.
finally found my heavy jacket - Im good to go...except for the huge mess I made looking for it :S - I just made myself a chore
You have to watch from the very beggining :D
Cypresswolf: That's future your problem
:D
:D Me in 10 hours - countdown
Vivix: Which ones did you try watching? O_o
Well, I liked some of the ones Isaw
my hair is so fluffy goodness
Okay, FINE. Watch the TV series, then if you want the characters to be properly established. Just don't hold your breath for Shinji to become a better person, though.
I watched..Death note..scrapped princess..and some others I can't remember
Bye Everypony :)
death note is for yaoi fangirls
Bye Cypresswolf
hmmm, i've got problems with php still
/me likes some yaoi
Cya, Cypresswolf
Vivix: Well, no wonder. You watched all the mind-screw animes. :P
why is this software so poorly designed
Goodbye cyp-gone >.<
no one seems to know
Hehe, well I acutally liked Death Note, because--the hero noone expected to die died
that I liked, but- I dunno, it wasn't the best thing I've seen
You are so slow AdamTheDuck :3
Vivix: My favorite anime is Lupin the 3rd
Can't remember what happened in Scrapped, but I liked it
Hmm, haven't heard of that one
i enjoyed inuyasha
Ponies47, I wrote Bye Cypress, but #bronystate :Cannot send to channel - Message blocked due to repeating (+K set)
I just tend to stay away from action animes--or you know "the world is ending" series in general
Gurren lagann is my fav anime though
;A;
It's good. It's about a thief and his gang and they're being chased around everywhere by a cop who's obsessed with catching him.
What time period or--world thingy?
Vivix: Well, that depends on what series/special/movie you're watching
Ooh~~
/me confused already
Vivix: Usually it takes place during the time era the piece was made in. :P
Vivix: The original series takes place in the 70s.
Ooh, yeah
whats everyone doinggggg
Lots of jazzy disco music
Funky stuff, aaall over
Vivix: The more recent TV specials takes place in the age of computers and iPhones
But it's all supposed to be just regular earth.
ah cool
They go to various places and steal various trasures and stuff
I kinda like--sticking ot that, but I also like heavy fantasy- without humans and stuff
Vivix: There are some fantasy elements here and there
Lately I'm kind of enamored with feral-furry stories, but there's not many I've found
But yeah, I might check that out- I don't watch a lot of series anymore, but never hurts to try things
like death note, I didn't want to see it at first, but- I did enjoy it
So anyway... So relaxing music for this slowing down chat. :3 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THQM52jk0gg
Some*
The nice part about Lupin is that it's extremely episodic. No continuity whatsoever. So you can literally start watching anywhere
And watch it in no particular order
Aah, that's always a good thing when jumping into long running series
And the feel of the piece is different depending on who's directing it. Sometimes it's heavy on the comedy, sometimes it's sweet and heart-warming, Usually it's kinda raunchy, and sometimes it's angsty.
I happen to value continuity in my stories. Episodic series are always stuck in "Status Quo is God" mode.
Gold_Demona: Ikr, continuity is just a bonus
BYE everypony, off to class
/me explodes into space
Goodbye Bronysith
Later, Bronysith
Gold_Demona: Lupin the 3rd is timeless, bless Monkey Punch
I love continuity also, but it's nice when a series isn't restricted by canon
I like continuity depending on what kind of story
Which Lupin is. At my last count I think there were like 4 different origin stories for Lupin and his gang
Hehe
Phase4, 5 hours \:3/
O.o
My two favorites are "First Contact" and the new series "The Woman Named Fujiko Mine"
Aww I was gonig to ask bronysith if his planet needs him :(
Night everyoneeeeeeeee
byeeee
Goodnight Resonantwaves
But that's enough about that. Now I'm babbling. :P
/me wikis both those
Cya Resonantwaves!
I warn you though. The Fujiko Mine series is VERY raunchy
I almost couldn't watch through it.
Hehehe
Luckily it's only 13 episodes long
When I see First Contact i think of the Carl sagan movie
"Because the show airs at 1:29 am,[2] it technically debuted on April 5, 2012."
That's quite some time to air
Yeah
but yeah so Fujiko Mime is like that season or---run?
huh?
Since it's 13 episodes-
It's just a short series
/me not quite used to the anime world
ahh
I gotta go now school. Laters
There are shorter. FLCL is only 6 episodes long. :D
Bye Ponies47
That series is a complete mind-screw though.
!
Gold_Demona: and yet it makes much more sense than Evangelion
It makes less sense than Eva
Hehehe
Gold_Demona: not possible
I have a series on my HD that's 2 episodes. It's even more mindscrewy than FLCL
What series is that?
Twilight Q
Never heard of it... Don't think I want to either. O_o
Gold_Demona: if it's for comedy's sake then mind screw is acceptable :D
MadSurge: This is true.
And FLCL pulls that off quite well
Bobobo Bobo Bobo is like that too.
Gold_Demona: although there are good serious mind screw things
Ohey a stream
What a name
Gold_Demona: I love Bobobobo Bobobo
o.o
Damnit Phase4
Sudden omnious Pinano!
Gold_Demona: he's seven times mother.
Y u scare everyone?
Piano
MadSurge: I like Bobobo because the English voice of Bobobo is the same guy that does my favorite English voice for Jigen. :D
AdamTheDuck, :3
5 hours \:3/
Oh wait... It's 6 hours
Gold_Demona: I like silly things like Bobobo :D
AdamTheDuck, are there many people in the lobby right now?
Is that the starfish thing?
Phase4, there usually is, but I was about to head off to sleep soon :P
Ah, Bobobo. The shonen action series in which mindscrew is weaponized.
so do you just keeps saying bobobobobobobobo and hope people willl understand? because that seems hard
Phase4, need my sleep, maths test up tomorrow :3
ah
Dem logs, indices and functions aren't gonna work themselves out >.>
stupid apache
i don't want you to run index.php
i want you to tell php-fpm to run it
Mutterguy: Nah, Bobobo is the guy's name. Bobobo Bobo Bobo.
Mutterguy: it's a manga/anime series where the protagonist is a muscular man with a giant afro that fights with his nose hair.
Wat
Phase4, from what I've noticed, there were loads of people in the beta throughout the day, around 10 rooms open, most of them full, there was even a full 4v4 match
Pronounced "Bo b'bo Bo BO b'bo"
that sentence...
soo much invite
I am not kidding
Amazing
and then steam broke
I realise but... that sentence
He fights with his nosehair and his fro for the right to have hair
Steam is so silly sometimes
"connection attempt failed"
It's not a sentence. It's his name
Phase4, you need to register as well for GoI
no what MadSurge said
/me rolls around
His best pal is the anthropomorpiphication of an explosion that is even sillier, Mutterguy
AdamTheDuck, o_O
Hiii Jmo
/me rolls around with Jmo :$
it won't connect :(
Oh lol XD
Phase4, it'll ask you to create a character name and your email when you connect
I only watched the first couple of episodes of it. Mostly to listen to Bobobo's voice.
...i guess i have to what that then. if the description is making me chuckle ten it has to be good
*watch
ah
Brb putting away pots and boiling some pasta
Phase4, and isn't it hard to read dark red on a black background? :P
it is a bit
yeah i better go to be now
but i cbf changing the colours
*bed - see all the typos!
Phase4, just use a preset colour scheme, that's what I did :P
I do get a vibe from Bobobo in that it was meant to somehow spoof Hokuto no Ken.
/me sets down fly paper for Jmo to roll on
Huzzah :3
Oh yeah. Everyone's fighting style has names that start with "Fist of the"
Dat intro music
AdamTheDuck, yeah, guns of icarus is broken for me :(
Covering yourself in tape and slowly pulling it off can be an interesting experience
Phase4, :<
You'd know Vivix.
Fist of the Nose Hari!
hair*
Freeee leg waxing!
score!!!
i think my isp is having routing issues
Apparently not-
Well I need some sleep for tomorrow
TheMaster, thats hitting land?
Goodnight everyone :)
nope. I'm just being hit by the feeling tiredness and a very mild head ache
/me stops rolling around with Jmo :<
its going to be flying over my house in a few hours or so
good AdamTheDuck
or maybe a day, eventually
/me procededs to hit the hay
I'm a long way from the coast. I might get some rain from Sandy, but nothing like what NYC is getting.

I's 23 ya'll
I'm 26 and 23/24ths
Nope Dari, I was just ruined by the Internet at a young age and learned stuff at a younger age than I should of.

/me noms on Gold_Demona as he/she is almost as old as most of his friends
heh
Rev: I is she. :3
for some reason I always envision 28-32 to be comfortable age-
I'll probably regret that thought when I am that old, but eh-
lawljaymo
Yay! You don't taste like testosterone then!
or- maybe not
iknow
Vivix: Going by my own experience, I think 25 is the best age
lawliknowright
Well, that's not too long until, let's hope you're right
lawlliketotally
lawlwhyaretalkinglikedis
No clue.
But then I'm only 28. Not that big a difference really
I blame the sheep.
/me noms on Gold_Demona like he is a brain slug

Bwahahaha
Need to play with Phase
Mutterguy|SLP: It would be wise for me to sleep, yes.
So long as you're not a headcrab Rev
What headcrabs do when they mount your head-
damn you lamarr
or rather, Dr. Kleiner
Vivix: Lamarr is harmless tho. I wouldn't mind having her on my head. XD
Dr Lamarr
I'm not! Although your conditioner tastes delicious, Gold_Demona x3
but Kleiner said it's their way of maating
.-.
Lamleiner
"Fruitlessly, ofcourse"
Rev: I don't use conditioner. :D
/me plays Wen ad
Then it is your shampoo!
Wait... i can't figure out if Jmo is British or Aussie
He's an AC
Vivix: Mating? By taking control of a dead body? O_o
Necrophilia? Neat.
lolwut?
Wat.
Apparently- he said, eeh, I can't remember the direct quote, "The worst she can do is to attempt to mate with your head. Fruitlessly of course"
Oh God
Suddenly stay away from Lamarr
Vivix: LOL That makes Barney's nickname for them even more appropriate. Head humpers. :D
Sounds like a mushrooms
hey! that's not so weird. male kakapos do it
Hehe yeaa
Mashrooms

Are we in Canterlot?

Gold_Demona: do you know No More Heroes?
I've heard the title before, but I don't know anything more about it

well it looks like the hub is in full spoiler mode
theMaster: how so?
this is going to be harder to avoid than harry potter spoilers were
/me glances at the topic
well the hub and several channels just showed the first 8 minutes of the new season
what the hell!
its on eqd
look
/me glances at the topic
i dont think i want to
EQD has been pretty good about keeping spoilers... marked
it is marked
I think the only "spoiler" I've unwittingly ran into was because they embedded a youtube video that was a playlist, and it went from the original item to a spoiler item

Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire, Part 1" airs in 12 days, 1 hours, 3 minutes, 53 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012)
allo Ankano_BrOnyxia, and geez ,it's in 12 days
so what won the lottory?
:D
ill make a chat room especially for GBC
and idk
gameboy color?
nah. greek brony community

There's already a channel for that
#geek
not geek lol
greek
Ohhh
xD
People in Greece have computers still?
funny
Seriously, isn't Greece fucked over in an economical sense?
well there are many people acting like fags about it so nvm
and no
Well, that's just the last thing I heard about Greece. Back in like, May
Germany is going to bail them out
media?
until spain and italy collapse because of their debt and then game over
its not only greece. many other countries have economical problems
hai
they dont seem to care now. but when they will it will alrdy be late
like us
the only economical problem is that they can't into competetive economies. Retirement at 50-60 is ridiculous. Nobody in greece produces anything and the people expects handouts.
allo barb
expect*
Hai Barb|CardboardBox
ill just leave though and go live somewhere else
We talking about the Greek economy?
yes, really the whole EU
kinda
who would have thought that 70 or so years later germany would rule europe anyway
Sup suckas?
allo hoody
well my life is still the same idk..
Hai Hoody|Skool
and hi
Hai~
Its kind of sad that the only reason I know the Greek economy is bad is thanks to a development company out there. They created Darkfall.
why is it so much harder to wake up when its cold -_-
because the bed is so warm and you don't wanna get out :3
economy got fucked up coz
politicians
its not your fault if you're in the united states. our media doesn't seem to know that there arn't places other than the u.s. and the middle east
r like thieves here
are places*
no, not politicians. the people wanted crippling socialism and they got it.
I
am
so bored right now
Then do some schoolwork
you can hear lots of stuff from the media.. lies and thats for every country
I dont have any...
Then read a text book
F*ck that
its like the media tries to make us racists

Also, look for "OpenFlix" on Youtube. There are movies in the Public domain you can watch in pretty decent quality.
Also Dark Fall is f2p at the moment, up untill nov 15th
I wonder how many of yous guys would play it. lol

to the girl I'm out with
at this point I'm thinking "what the fuck"
and she's like "oh, this is my brother"
and he's telling her how he needs a ride to work NOW
so she has to drive this clown to work
Prince_Blueblood: :|

All Of My Games On Steam Are The Free To Play Stuff
I have 2 F2P games on STeam, and 1 I paid for
brb
TF2 and APB
The other 200 odd are bought ;]
Good afternoon, everyone. How are you all today? :)
Eh
Good after noon AJIsAwesome, I am good thanks you? :)
I Play Champions Online, Combat Arms, Forsaken World, And I Just Stopped Playing Dungeon Fighter Online
AJIsAwesome: Well, to put it bluntly and lightly, after my cooking, I want to kill someone brutally
I'm fine, Colt_Brovakiin. :)
Hello aji
AJIsAwesome:
Thats good to hear :)
/me hugs Colt_Brovakiin Serenity and Laurayne. :)
/me huggles AJIsAwesome back :3
Serenity: Why do you want to do that?
/me Hugs Everypony :P
Well, I couldn't find my main tin opener
So I had to use the other one which was damaged
Ah.
20 minutes later, I decided to just pull a knife and hammer trick
Hey AJIsAwesome
Then even more, my toaster launched out a lice of toast onto the floor
So my cat robbed it
Ouch.
/me Is Now An Aunt :3
So yeah, I'm pissed :]
Your cat eats toast?
ikr
Laurayne: Hooray! :)
oic how it is
Well, I hope your day gets better, Serenity.
What's wrong, Jmo?
My Neice Was Born This Morning, A Month And A Half Early
Laurayne: Prepare the agony
I hate babies...
hey
Laurayne: I was born two and a half months early. :D
I was supposed to be born in late August.
aji: That impatient to agonise your mother, eh?
y u so impatient AJIsAwesome
I Was Born August 2nd 1990
I have no idea. *shrugs*
April 24 1997
Your A Youngun
i was born day/month/year
srsly do, you might not want to share such information online
twilight_sprinkle: Wow, you're 'well old
twilight_sprinkle: I'm quite sure that there's no filly foolers here.
Dont You Know Its Impolite To Call A Lady Old >:(
LOL
Filly Fooler Is Lesbian Yes?
Judging by the name, I'd presume young
Since filly = horse less than 4 years old
Laurayne: Yh fan term
/me Is A Filly Fooler
Serenity: Filly can also be a female horse
D:
Cherchez la Mare maybe?
Filly is female horse less than 4 years old :P
And colt is male less than 4
dear god theyre playing the ghost busters music at my school
Serenity: Well horse age is a little different than human ages remember?
otakon17: This is in Human years
"Silly filly" sounds so appropriate :D
Also just beat episode 4 of The Walking Dead
otakon17: Is he dead? Or did you save him?
Serenity: No no I mean in terms of maturity and such
otakon17: another cliffhanger?
/me Likes Dem Boobies
Ofc
You murderer
Laurayne: Who doesn't? :P
Serenity: If you mean who fell, no I saved him
Anyway, lets stop talking about our sexual orientation
otakon17: Oh, that's alright then
Why? Me Wanna Talk ABout Boobie :$
Serenity: Yh but it went the route I fogured it would
k im back
Because this is actually a T rated chat :P
Boobies Is Trated
OneTrickPony,do you have one song?
I'm sure it's M :P
smelt: yes I do
you are cool
It can be M rated, depending on the extremity of the conversation. :D
Im Sure Its Not
smelt: lol thnx
according to topic its rated P, for peanuts
This chat is rated c :3
does this look evil-ish http://i47.tinypic.com/24y4wms.jpg http://i50.tinypic.com/2mrxu1z.jpg ? or just plain silly ?
Wait, why did she cover up the torch?
The chat is PG13
So nothing explicit
nou oatkun
AJIsAwesome: Because it still provides power
Ask the mods
And looks nicer too
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Bit of both. More the first, but a little of the second.
oi oatkun wat movie is dis
Im Not Saying Anything Explicit. Just That I Like Boobies
Serenity: Ah, thanks. :)
Weeee
I may not play Poopcraft any more, but I still know my shit
and how the monster mash
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: seems creepyish to me
....
now*
aaand i'm back ^_^
what's the difference twilight_sprinkle ?
anyway back to napping
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: well its not terrifying, but it is creepy
Welcome back, BladedWings! :)
welcome back!
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Have you played Prey?
yep
That game is grimdark based, but it's not scary, but it's creepy as fuck
You see the difference? :p
makes sense somehow
Prey is screwed up
Especially that one boss
If you hadn't played it, you wouldn't understand me :]
Those who play it know who I mean
13prey is fun
speaking of screwed up, did sumi finish both evangelion movies last night?
Wait
/me is still waiting for prey 2
yus eyjey
fraid so

Can't wait for the third movie.

You should've studied! :D
i Did study

Ah.

Dang, that sucks.
so i stayed up until 5.30 am preparing
and had to get up at 8.30 am
Is that a zombie?
same question Evil-ish http://i45.tinypic.com/nec3vb.jpg http://i47.tinypic.com/63xb9g.jpg http://i50.tinypic.com/33x7cqr.jpg ?
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I think that is really good! :3
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: First one, yes. Second one, maybe. Third one, not so much.
They are better then what I could do, anyway :P
Those are very nice drawings, though. :)
Colt_Brovakiin: Agreed. :D
:D
need to find another way to make a Grin
Hey

Ahh, weee
We're back
Welcome back Serenity :3
Was IRC down for a while?
And I have reclaimed my name there can only be one "insert evil laughter"
Been unable to connect
We should try kicking all the idle people and see if they log back in. :D
welcome back!
AJIsAwesome: I second this!
AJIsAwesome: There would be like 30 people, tops
:P
AJIsAwesome: define Idle
Owned
Have to go to hospital in 10 mins :L
People who just leave their client on for says and don't type anything.
*days
hey guys
I remember this one game in another chat that I played were everyone was giving mod powers and the point of the game was to kick everyone else out.
hiya alexxm!
Hi, alexxm. :)
:3 this music
HI
Midnight_Splendor: Couldn't you just do /kick others
how are things OneTrickPony and AJIsAwesome
Pretty good, alexxm. How about you? :)

alexxm: pretty good, how bot you?
I am back
You missed me.
I meesed me too
Welcome back, Barb|CardboardBox. :D
No the controls were rigged so that you could only kick one person at a time.
i'm good AJIsAwesome and OneTrickPony
Ahh I see
Anyone here use mIRC?

I should
wb!
Just looking for a few pointers, because sometimes, internet is a bitch
I'm fine
I dont want to pay though
'tis free
oh
13here we go
mIRC was "free for trial" wasnt it?
I thought it gives you a trial
What ya makin' Shizuka?
NullRadix: Yeah, but I think you can continue with less features afterwards
Like WinRAR etc
Yay, mine cart!
Serenity: Shizu's been building a rollercoaster all morning
You're a 'Murican?
Because to me, that sounds like she's been poopsocking
It's 1753 hours here
12:52 PM here.
*checks time* oh, its afternoon
its 1:53 here
what is Bronystates' IRC server?
LightIRC, I think.

Alot of trash too
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Japanese Comic: Many Many Pony
OH MY GOD.
/me huggles ASoftFluffyThing
Yes, ASoftFluffyThing? :)
The fuck...?
:<?
All those joins
ima sowwy.

???
I invited them. They will not be cleaning up afterwards.
ah, the bliss of the FlashClient
Did anyone else randomly disconnect about 10 minutes ago?
lol
Creeper angry
Netsplit
You were part of the netsplit
ASoftFluffyThing: yes, many disconnects
Oooh
Ah. I see not logs for join/leave
no*
yay for flash chat indeed.
I'm using mIRC
I actually do have mirc on this computer.
I just don't use it
I use it at home though
I just started using mIRC again
it is nice
do I hear haibane renmei?
The music is oddly fitting.
Goddammit, splits.
That's better.
it would not be crazy to suggest "get used to it"
/me looks outside
sure looks like it
13oh i think i know what the problem is
I don't know about you, but this all looks like fancy magic to me.
good evening
Evenin'.
hi Eli
evening Eli
13or i'm wrong..
13odd bug..
Hi, Eli. :)
what's up?
wait
Something wrong shizuka?
13when retracting, my bridge goes two pulses then waits the rest of the cycle
this is nice recovery music Shizuka
13once the light cycle finishes then the bridge starts accepting pulses again
13the lights are supposed to be on all through the cycle, which works for the extend phase
What on earth are you playing?
Hmm, minecraft
Chrysalis: legos extreme
not sure what you mean by light pulses
i see frames
13signal comes in here to a toggle latch from the buttons
Right, what are you trying to do?
13it's constantly pulsing one of the frame motors, this just switches which one
13there's a counter set for 8 pulses to control lights up top
hmm
Why not use a state cell?
just seeing that makes me go dizzy ._. can't even do a proper red stone door
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Looks a lot like witchcraft to me.
idk myself what's the problem, but i have a friend who's great at these sort of things
shame he's offline >.>
13it doesn't seem to be the problem
13the counter itself has no bearing on the bridge
Hory fluff the wind gusts are getting more frequent....
Sandy?
AJIsAwesome! :$
AYEJAY
MadSurge! :$
JAYMOO :3
which one looks better ? first one or second one http://i48.tinypic.com/2rddr8n.jpg http://i45.tinypic.com/mhdhzq.jpg ?
13see there?
I'd say second one.
13nothing happens on the return run until the counter turns off the lights
13but that's only possible if that line is getting pulses, which go to the motor
the second strikes me as a better drawing, but I like the perspective on the first more
TheGreatAndPowerfulT second
I'm not sure. I'd go with first on eyes, but grin on second.
AJIsAwesome: hope you like Fallout (not Equestria :D ) http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/bfe9a71ee3ae532f2166c6e300a88667.png
uhmmm choices choices
Ugh, I want to play Fallout again.
MadSurge: :D
And I blame you, MadSurge.
Not that I mind.
13think i need to break for now though, get food
13hope ponies enjoyed :)
Kammerjunk: well at least you blame me for a good game.
:3
I do like food.
Thanks Shizuka~
Shizuka: I did! It's like grownup Legos :D
13if nopony takes up i might come back in later
THANKS Shizuka
Shizuka: enjoy your meal!
I wish my desktop was this clean.
But I'm just too lazy to clean up.
Enjoy your food shizu ~ thanks for the stream
brb gonna make top ramen
May your taste buds be blessed with only the most delicious of food, Shizuka.

Gah
wtf?
Link wall -_-
o.O
AJ is stoopid.
AJIsAwesome: Might want to derpy.me that in the future.
;~;
I know, use a link shortener. :D
I just didn't know that it would be that long.
Liar.
;~;
LiarjackisAwesome? :D
finally, an Illinois ad
truly, this is the greatest one yet
I just realised I haven't refreshed BronyState in weeks.
Hi everyone
Of, well. I guess I'll do it when this thing crashes.
Ave, Rainboom.
afternoon Rainboom
Oh, well*
Hi, Rainboom. :)
sure is pouring outside from where im at 6_9
hai Rainboom
aww that music is over
hallo Rainboom
Meh. It's just biting cold over here. As usual.
cant wait til next next saturday
!cd
Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire, Part 1" airs in 11 days, 20 hours, 37 minutes, 3 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012)
woot woot
No school again tomorrow..THE FUN HAS BEEN DOUBLED!
Yay
we rly need a flutteryay emotion
I'm glad to see some good came out of it. What's the current big whatchamacallit named?
:[
That would help. All I did was write "no skool" and put the vid on my FB
Or we could just link one. :D
looks like Sandy Cheeks got mad in bikini bottom :/
I wanted them to name it scrambles.....(In light of the joke) Somepony made fun of texas.
Well, the emotions available in the embedded IRC client aren't really anything the mods can change.
emoticons*
Holla everypony! :)
Im in the mood for some pony thread simulators
Heus, GilDash.
heya GilDash :)
Rainboom: IT BEGINS
the emoticons in the embedded irc is something you add on your own
aaaaand flash crash :P
well, your own = the mods
Pony Thread Simulators? Eh, what the heck. XD
Hi, GilDash. :)
Vivix: And not anything anyone using another client can see.
no only the webclient
Pondooo
Hello GilDash! :$
I demand more Vinyl Scratch and/or Derpy in the new episodes
^
/me demands nothing
I don't really want them to cater to the fans.
That'd be terrible.
same
I want them to keep doing what they're doing, and kinda ignore us
/me slaps Vivix
Rainboom: if that wouldnt mind that is
of course it would be horrible
OI
ITS TRUE JMO
Vivix: Yeah, same here.
WHY DON'T YOU RESPOND TO ME
WHAT!?
I would still like vinyl to make more appearence not like change everything THEN it would be screwed
STEAM
I WILL PUNCTURE YOUR LUNGS.
Like if they added humans in the show o_o
it didn't blink man!
Oh, absolutely. It's great that they acknowledge us.
Only a little nod to the fans, but VERY rarely.
THIS WHOLE TIME ;__;
Rainboom: Oh Gods above.
Kammerjunk: The horror the horror
I wouldnt mind more vinyl cameos
but yeah, keep us fans away from the writers
Rainboom: only for a split second in the background. And noone will ever address it in the show. :D
^
Did you guys see the spoiler?
nooooo
Oi
Nope.
Meh
discussing it = ban
Kawaii_icybeauti: noooo
I did not and will not see any spoiler for S3.
yup
Don't want to either.
It's fantastic of them to acknowledge us, but they should only give nods VERY rarely.
Kawaii_icybeauti: No spoilers please
AJIsAwesome: indeed
AJIsAwesome: I concur.
MadSurge: Couldn't help it...November 10th is too far.
It's like the moment a spoiler is mentioned I approach the edge of the ship, ready to jump at a moment's notice. XD
And no, I mean that 8 min spoiler on the EQD
AJIsAwesome, true- I mean the derpy thing was fun. But you know, keep it at a minimum
I didn't even see the HUB promo for it. :D
I usually only watch 1 spoiler to know like what the plot is and all exactly
Vivix: Agreed.
I haven't been on EQD for months because they're not very good at hiding spoilers.
I don't want to see promos or anything- I want to be bedazzled and awestruck by all the things
Kawaii_icybeauti: I know events until the third episode. After that, it's no spoilers for me!
I didn't even want to know the name of the episode- but I lost that battle pretty fast
I haven't been on EQD in absolutely ages. :S
MadSurge: Is that why you guys get angry when the commercial break shows what happens next week?
GilDash: Because of S3?
I'm only on there for stuff not involving S3. :D
Kawaii_icybeauti: I no get angry O_o
AJIsAwesome: I just don't think they're particularly good at hiding spoilers.
In my opinion, in the new LPS its like they took half of mlp and put it in there, even if the animators also work for lps and mlp as well.
But soem people go "NUUUU SPOILER!!" during the breaks.
Kammerjunk: Nah, I stopped in about May... curiously enough the same time I started spending time on this place...
Kammerjunk: Yeah, I have to agree. :D
I still go to EQD, but I scroll as fast as I can to avoid anything about the show
I found this place after the derpy thing, then came.
I dunno, I just really want to know absolutely nothing
I don't even like knowing what the episode titles are. :S
^^
^
Kawaii_icybeauti: same :D
GilDash: yea i agree its to like keep the surprises in when the episodes actually air instead of waiting for it
I seriously don't like knowing what the episode titles are. Even rumor titles.
I offically joined this place when I saw the movie night poster on EQD and District 9 was the A movie.
GilDash: ....wat?
It just kills it for me.
That Derpy reaction video did a lot of good for Bronystate!
So I was like "District 9 is showing, cool!"
AYEJAY IS STOOPI
D
lawl jaymoo u fail
Kawaii_icybeauti: What do you mean, 'What?' :S
I have returned with the food of thy gods
You know, I still secretly wish for something to happen that the fans will absolutely love. Because BronyState is funny when that kind of thing happens.
I go back to school on Halloween so that might be nice
Better be muffins.
AJIsAwesome, it's same here, the only preview I saw was the Daring Doo episode, because it looked so fun
Or it ain't food of thy gods.
GilDash: At least you should know the title. It's one thing to see previews but to not know the title....
Cupcakes > Muffins
not see*
Kawaii_icybeauti: Yet the titles give things away... I only know the first one and that's one too many. :S
I don't want to know the title, I don't see why I "must"
i like muffins more, the bread is tastier
As far as I'm concerned, the title is "Blah Blah Blah, Mister Freeman".
I was like D=! when the !cd revealed the name to me
My gosh, all this clay
RANDOM QUESTION (hard): If you could only hug ONE PONY which one would it be?
Rainboom: Twiley.
pingas
Cloudchaserrr..
I would glomp....ummmm.....Derpy!
I guess
No doubt. Because she's just that adorkable.
Kammerjunk: Agreed because Twily is best pony
dashie
Even thoguh rarity is my fave, she doesn't seem like much of a huger.
hugger*
I found out about this place through Ballad of The Brony. I stayed here for a while and left, but it was Zombieland on BMN that got me hooked on Bronystate. :D
Also because I'm scared of hugging Pinkie Pie. She'd probably strangle me.
hai everyone!
Hmm... I'd probably have to go with Rainbow Dash, even though she wouldn't like it. XD
Hi, Turgle. :)
My list if I could hug them: 1: Twilight 2: Pinkie 3: Dashie 4: Fluttershy 5: AJ 6: Rarity
Ave, Turgle.
hi Turgle
AYEJAY
Hay Turgle
I can stay up and watch ink masters tonight...can't wait!
Ink Masters?
Talking to a wall.
Gfdi
octopuses?
Kammerjunk: Powerhugs are best hugs!
I wasbored and watched Bob's Burgers today it was funny I guess
/me slaps AJIsAwesome
:O It's a tattoo competition hosted by the guitarist of jane's addiction.
The only Inks I know of are the Ink Spots.
ouch!
Y U NO RESPOND
Though I wouldn't mind hugging Spitfire either... just because.
that hurt, Jmo. ;~;
Good.
GilDash: Admit it, it's because of the bedroom eyes.
Spitfire would be a good hugger
Has there really not been a stream since I left here.
*?
/me gives AJIsAwesome a fake tatoo with Dashie on it
Kammerjunk: Actually it's because of those REA posters, but we'll go with that too.
What do you want, Jmo? :D
Nevermind.
Kawaii_icybeauti: Depends on when you left.
Steam newb >_>
Cmon, tell me! :p
Kammerjunk: I left at like 11am
Dat profile
11AM where?
jesus
Profile?
I don't know your crazy Moon timezone.
Shhhhh Ayejay
AJIsAwesome: you got steam now?
I don't get it, Jaymoo. :S
You never will.
twilight_sprinkle: I have Steam, but not any games.
Jmo: Why not? :<
ok
Oh hi, MahB- oh
Just watching the white-dotted circle spinning around and around makes me bored
Ayejay, don't worry.
But the Buffer Show is AMAZING.
Rainboom: But it's the best show ever!
Come for the buffer, stay for the ponies
GilDash: My favorite show is Paid Programming
hiya Mah-
My favourite TV show is the TV Test Screen.
why must you taunt me?
I remember we watched it on BronyState once.
This is the episode where we figure out that Lag's secretly cheating on Buffer, and we figure out about Buffer's long lost cousin!
It was quite interesting.
I like the white noise channel too :D
My favourite TV show is MLP, becaaause I stopped watching anything else
Rainboom: I've genuinely no idea what that is.
You know what? mips needs the Snake game that YouTube has.
I once hooked up a bass to the TV, that was a fun tv show
It does, Kammerjunk?
I like the one with the black and white grain and it makes a weird noise.
Oh wait, It NEEDS it. :D
Metal Gear Twilight or Metal Gear Dash?
Kammerjunk: there is a snake, see it goes in circles trying to eat itself
twilight_sprinkle: o u
Rainboom: How about both?
Whooooo
Alles Gut?
AJIsAwesome: I never said we cant have both so why not x3
:D
It would be awesome if there was an episode where the mane6's bodies get switched with eachother
Nah, that'd be too predictable.
Wekk, I'm ging ti olay Falliut niw.
maybe :P
Okay, I'm going to try that sentence again.
lawl
Well, I'm going to play Fallout now.*
/me applauds effort
This is what happens when I don't place my hand right and don't pay attention.
Misplaced hand syndrome
Dashie Pinkie Twiliy and Flutters are cutest ponies and I want to hug them all (also Pipsqueak Applebloom Sweetie Belle and Twist :O)
my tastebuds have been satisfied by the food of thy gods
Ambrosia?
CHOCOLATE MILK >_>
no, top ramen
not a big pipsqueak fan
but I adoore the CMC
and strangely enough, silverspoon and Diamod Tiara
Vivix: he's cute sounding in Italian :D
applebloom is best cmc
Trixie Discord and Queen Chrysalisare meh favorite villians in the show because the chaos has been tripled
I prefer Sweetie Bell-
13http://i.imgur.com/1l4Oi.jpg what a tragic loss of nutella
I don't think Trixie is a villain, but I adore her aswell
Sweetie Belle is best CMC
not so much Discord though-
Rainboom: /)
Shizuka: that sucks
Aw man, that sucks Shizuka.
Shizuka: NOOOOO WASTED FOOD :(
Shizuka D:
(/ upside down because im flying with Fluttershy
Vivix: she isnt a villain, she is an antagonist
I'm not suuuree she's a full on antagonist, but yes, something like that
is the stream still on
Vivix: I personally feel kind of bad for Trixie, I mean like she was just trying to enjoy herself by "impressing" the ponies with her "magic" and yet they hate on her.
It's an episode riddled up a bit by their hurried change -
but yeah, I feel bad for her
She's a bitch, no away around it, but what she was doing wasn't--you know, bad
I wanna hug Trixie and tell her shes awesome at magic x3
O hai
even if she can barely do it lol
She might be pretty talented compared to normal unicorns, but not compared to Twilight- going by her cutiemark atleast
hai ACS13123
I havent been here for ages now ._.
that feel
I swear... its been a loooong tiem
You shouldn't really insult the audience in showbusiness, but that said, she only started picking on ponies after the Mane 6 began berating her.
But not long enough for my pass to reset
So dats gud
Vivix: It might be more fitting if she was an earth pony claiming that shes a unicorn but you know a unicorn's a unicorn even if they suck at magic xD
ACS13123 when was the last time you were on?
Hmm?
OneTrickPony: About 2 months ago, maybe 2 and a half, not a looong time but its been a while
I rather see it as Twilight is absurdly talented compared to everypony else. :S
Well, I won't go into the fanon on magic- because we see so little about it in the eshow
oh
but I don't think Trixie is bad at magic-
the crowd seemed to enjoy it until she was heckled
ah, a pony discussion?
My friend Kyle joined the herd last week so he might be on here sometime when season 3 rolls by
ACS13123: Welcome back! Why were you away for so long?
Kinda, we were talking abouuut.. something
welcome ACS13123!!
then trixie happened
I have my own headcanon on magic. It's hard for me to remember it all some times, so I've written most of it down.
Ah, I haven't written any down, but I've had some great discussions here about it
I wish I can say that Trixie is best unicorn but Twilight is by far my favorite unicorn and character in the show
MadSurge: Stuff happened, and I just couldnt be asked to come on here (stuff that happened = TF2 stuff :P)
We don't know much about it in the show- like, babies have uncontrolled magic, kids have to learn magic, Twilight is exceptional at magic
that's about all we really know-
twilight is best unicorn
^
No love for Rarity?
^
Ahh, empty streams
:<
Twiley is just best pony, though.
/me big Rarity fan
How I missed you
rarity is just sexy
thast it
Ahh, Empty Spaces.
She's talented and wonderful too
Looks and smarts, aw yeah
Rainbow Dash is best unicorn!
I used to love Rarity she automaticlly made a bigger role in Season 2 and making me laugh at times although she was still funny in S1
^
^^
Also, coming back for season 3... cant miss that.
You should have seen snips in Cherrilee's garden. He seemed so sick in it.
Never read that-
ehehe
Snails is best alicorn
so, anyome know what won from the lottery last week?
That reminds me, Cheerilee is one of my favourite tertiary ponies
luna and celestia are only alicorns
...Cadence.
Actually agree Bronysith
I think of Cadence has a watered down alicorn- without the immmortality or full bloodline
Celestia is best earth pony!
b-b-but Cadance is Cute......
Unless the true Cadence was still a Changeling!
that doesnt make up for character development Dken2021
Luna is best earth pon- oh screw it she is best princess
^
I loved Cadance honestly. Her design is one of my personal favories.
favorites*
celestia and luna are only alicorns i recognize
Chrysalis has my absolute favourite design.
also cadances wings look fucking retarded
I liked Cadence a lot, actually
Bronysith: Yeah, well, Celestia is the only alicorn the toyline recognises.
but I don't consider her a full alicorn, don't mind reading fanfics where hse is though
no time for character development
Cadance didn't phase me at first, but she's my fav for design mostly
I think Cadence could be a pretty good character if they would develop her.
no
When I first saw a Canterlot Wedding I automatically LOVED evil cadence/queen chrysalis
She didn't have much of a role
Yeah, that's true Vivix.
hello Bronysith
I still liked her way more than I thought I would
Vivix: Yeah all she was was the bride
cause then in season 3 they will be worried more about giving cadance more episodes THAN GIVING APPLEJACK HER EPISODES AND SONG SHE SO DESPERATELY NEEDS
hey taoumi
Kammerjunk|FO, highfive
WE GET IT SITH.
:D
Calm down Sith 6_9
seriously, if they give cadance another episode before applejack
I think she's not an alicorn though- but she's something special
Vivix: GIMME DAT MEAT
Bronysith: I will laugh.
Applejack needs more love. We can ALL agree. :D
At you.
MEAT!?
APPLEJACK AND/OR DASHIE NEED THEIR OWN SONGSSS
AJ needs more love, but I don't think there's a quota
Rainboom: dashie already does
Vivix: Hey, I don't know about you, but hands are all the rage right now.
Vivix: Same.
Bronysith: w8 rly? i forgot what it was called
AJ doesn't get episodes, just guest appearances. XD
Bronysith: In the spoilers, and sorry for saying them, there were 2 episodes hinting to apple family episodes.
Rainboom: may the best pet win is rainbow dash/fluttershy song
Duet though
GilDash: :D
Rainboom: that is THEIR song
Bronysith: I mean like a solo song
Rainboom: well applejack needes a song first
Bronysith: BOO!
Applejack is best backround pony.
Bronysith: ye
yea*
she had like what? 15 seconds of singing time overall?
Kawaii_icybeauti, I didn't read your message, but saying anything is about s3 is ban
AJ needs more love
Uggghhhh....
She does
As long as AJ gets more love, I don't mind other characters getting more development before her.
She could use it. I mean, she is one of the mane 6.
True, I wouldn't mind knowing more about Cadence
I personally think they need more AJ or Rarity episodes
What episodes has Applejack had, by the way? I mean, she had Applebuck Season and the Appleoosa one in S1, but she didn't have any episodes in S2, did she?
I really want to know more about everypony and eveyrthing really, so whatever they throw I'll eat
as mush as rarity's my fav, she's had enough
/me BladedWings|AFK
Vivix: This.
You eat ponies?
You evil thing.
Kammerjunk|FO: Last Roundup, I recall.
in S2 she kiinda had over the barrel, but not really-
imo that is
fail!
Kammerjunk|FO: She had The Last Roundup
Kammerjunk|FO does the last roundup and cider count
yeah
Kammerjunk|FO: Also the slumber party episode.
Kammerjunk|FO: Wouldn't the last roundup and cider 6000 count?
AJIsAwesome, Rainboom, alexxm, Kawaii_icybeauti: No, Last Roundup was clearly a Derpy episode.
But yeah, she had the cider one.
Hehehe
lawl
Yeah last roundup, that was the one I was thinking about
i wasn't aware that apple jack sang in the cider squeezie 6000
AJ wasn't reaaally that much IN it
Kammerjunk|FO: Yeah, It was going to be an applejack epsidoe until derpy appeared :D
Unfortunately, Derpy stole the spotlight. :D
D;
Hi Blako
taoumi: she didnt but it was still kinda her episode
It kinda was yeah
taoumi: We're not talking about siging, it's if she had an epsidoe revolved around her...or at leats was suppsoe to be for her.
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Rise of the Clockwork Stallions Demo Trailer
Vivix: I actually have to agree, even though the episode was mainly about AJ, it gave the other characters much more screen time than her. :D
it was like a mix of AJ FS and RD episode
Yeah, great episode, but more of a m6 episode I guess
Wait, what bout fall weather friends?
Vivix: Agreed.
Dat sustained tropical sotrm force wind
wasn't that S1?
Kawaii_icybeauti: OH YEAH, that too.
You know, I kinda miss being here...
The Last Roundup, Ponyville Confedential, and Putting Your Hoof Down were probably the most dramatic episodes of Season 2 (well you know, besides A Canterlot Wedding)
I dunno...
Huh
Ooh, Earthbound?!
Putting your hoof down was gooood~~
Rainboom: What about S2 premiere?
Putting your hoof down was bucking awesome.
Spiteful Crow, haha :)
AJIsAwesome: yeah
earthbound you say?
In s3 Applejack will in turn steal everyone else's spotlight :D
oh yeah the premiere was great too
If somepony tries to block, show them your c- no
o u
Kammerjunk|FO: co- nope
Kammerjunk|FO: Yeah, no. :D
that you ROCK, Kammerjunk|FO ;)
Why would I show them my chicken?
I'm sure it'd be effective, though.
nope.avi
what? he was gonna say cockatrice
Vivix: *scootaloo
^^
Vivix: Because chickens are terrifying.
True
Except Scoots.
chickens are zen.
Especially chickens in your eyes
Chickens are best pony
I was at this lil' farm thing, and they had poultry that sounded like rusty hinges.
!
Chickens smell weird and are loud
I forget the name of them, but honestly, they sound exactly like they need WD-40
ScootaLittle Chicken
Vivix: most birds are like that
Oi leave chickens alone.
yeah-
Use to have one for years.
Woo
I like doorknobs :D
ever been to a eh chickenfarm for meat production? Horrrribbbleee
think i got 10 mann vs machine running
Kurra: When you said WD-40, I automatically thought of an astromech droid from Star Wars.
Chickens are lovey
Chrysalis_: Nice! :D
Hah :)XD
Chickens are chickeny
and i have no idea how to test it lol
Chickens do resemble chickens, yes.
UM.
I can't eat scootaloo, too much water taste
Chickens are lovely. Tikka masala, wonderful dish. XD
I'm sure they taste the part, too.
BAWK BAWWWKKKK
Im' having scootaloo for dinner today.
I love Tikka Masala, but I pick out the chicken <,<
One time I went Hwoogaobblegobble at like eight turkeys, and they all responded :D
Vivix: ... Wat.
Hey you guys!
I was like 'I FOUND MY PEOPLE'
/me sucks with meat

YUSH.

and then I petted a very pregnant goat :'3 <3 and indeed Vivix XD
AWw goats are adorable
I LOVE GOATS
Not a word Jmo!
goats are cool
Vivix: What are you a dictionary?
So no stream at the moment?
goats are adorable, especialy to 2 babies that were at the zoo...so soft..
Screw you, I'll sacrifice all the goats I want.
Ugly things.
;__; they're prettyy
For some reason, I can't STAND the eyes of goats and sheep. They just.........creep me out. :S
^
Yeah the kids are cute
They are very creepy.
AJIsAwesome: They look like reverse cat eyes.
the eyes take some getting used to, but now I think they're cute too
one time me and a llama at a part had a staring contedt
contest*
but AJIsAwesome consider this: Horses have the same eyes as goats
Imagine AJ with goat eeeyees
oh god
........
oh yea, while at work, there was a box of those mlp coloring books, but I wasn't able to open them cause there was no room for them on the shelf
Imagine a world
Where ponies existed
And had ghost eyes
!?
And were slightly weird
And..
I'll be back in a moment, switching to my Firefox browser.

Take care BladedWings!
...In fact, I hates him SO much, I want him to be Youtube Pooped everywhere...
Bye BladedWings
...But i'm just saying.
I never saw the appeal in Fred. I thought he was just a one-shot character in that iCarly show.
VenHur: That can be arranged.
6Just randomly found it on someone's dA and sat staring at it while lolwtfing.. :P
Oh, and bye BladedWings.
(Looks at News) Oh Sandy's already at the (New) Jersey shores, missed that since I've been out

6I hate speaking in haiku
So yeah, I liked Super Mario Land...and the Superball power-up.
6just go find some gems.
No, really, that's what it called. Look it up.
New york is taking a beating right now 2
I did.
VenHur: but Fred IS a youtube poop
...Oh.
MadSurge: You can YTP a YTP.
In fact Ima take a piture out in the storm
YTPception!
LOLs
Dang Sandy's made it so cold here
Everlasting_Joy: that is true
In fact, when I saw the first Fred episode on Nick I LITERALLY got a headache from it.
dafuq is right
At least we're just getting rain and cold weather and no tornados or t-storms
6xDDD
AJIsAwesome: good thing the Hub has no such shit :D
Though it's terrible for people in the major hit zones
True you dont want what we got down here
Zombert, how bad is it?
Oh, you lived around the white parts on what's the weather screen showned?
Or something like that...
I love the Aquabats. :D
BAD
AJIsAwesome: Hey, same here.
AJIsAwesome: I got headaches and a stunned look when I saw the promo commercials for Fart, I mean Fred.
VenHur: BrentalFloss and Super Mario Land: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAtWQ_xn0kI
It's Cheesy, But it's GOOD to be cheesy.
it already toped Irean and it realy hasent started yet
VenHur: It's cheesy in a great way. :D
Well When I went to bed last night the wind speed was around 25MPH
AJIsAwesome: but the Aquabats are hilarious! They LOVE being cheesy fun :D
I woke up this morning and it was 45-50 mph
its at 50 60 70 MPH now
I've always been a person that loves it when it's REALLY windy outside.
Great scotts! Let's hope it cannot reach 88!
I'm not tracking it at the moment but my shed in the back well it aint there no more
Wow. Not a good day to leace the house obviously.
like 2 hours ago 70 trees had already been riped out of the ground
MadSurge: That's what's so fun about the Aquabats :).
Wind's only 22 here
AJIsAwesome: I don't really love bad weather, but heavy rain is nice to look at :)
It sure is. :)
...Slow day in the chatroom, huh?
yep.
Ya not to mention that the danger from other people is high as well
mmhmm
VenHur: Monday afternoon with no stream, course its slow
I actually like Mondays. It's Tuesdays that I don't like.
Like I said a moment ago all the people who did evacuate out of fear their houses have been broken into
... [sigh] I hate mondays...
Zombert: :(
wow this is a good remake www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEChu3hnJhU
VenHur: Yep, Garfield
It's ok though I gots a fire arm
6Can you guys maybe give me some ideas for a story?
I like Skrillex...
Aint no one braking into my house
I'll be back later tonight, see you folks later
But i'm more on a side of Classical Music...like...

"Is this the real life? It's this a peaceful day? No stream out of the blue, nothing to see..."

Can somepony give my mom an example of why an 11 year old should be able to play red ead redemption
http://youtu.be/gsS-6-gxb30
6Well,so far I've made a character (I think she'll be the main one) and have the idea to have her not know anything about her past and stuff..My problem is that I can't really think of a plot thingie..like where it would take place,powers,whether there would be some supernatural stuff..Idk..My head is just stuck on Bleach and Naruto and I can't really come up
6with anything different..
DAMN CHAT DERPS!
:<
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/46b4e3c9cc1e42f0002f9fd617d3cfce.png Pinkie has a gift for you <3
aaw
Can somepony give my mom an example of why an 11 year old should be able to play red ead redemption
d'aww
MadSurge ok... that is cute.
MadSurge: Thank you for that heart attack.
Pink3, why would an 11 year old be playing an M-rated game in the first place?
Pink3, what is red ead redemption?
Pink3 well would you like a psychologists aproach to it? ^^
MadSurge, it's so ad'aww-able
Everlasting_Joy: *hides heart attack cannon* what? >_>
:D
I just want you to sugar coat it so i at least have a chance with an EXTREMELY over protective.
Hoofs up if you play both the normal and pony dub of Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites at the same time.
ASoftFluffyThing: I also still love giant lollipops, too bad you don't see them around that often
Panda|Drawing, I'd like to hear a psychologist's approach.
:|
MadSurge, you can find giant lollipops. You probably have to go to a fair/carnval or an old-timey general store.
ASoftFluffyThing: You can find them in Ye olde sweet shops
Serenity, I don't think we have one of those over here.
ASoftFluffyThing: yeah, but I mean general stores. At least Chupa Chups are still big :3
13http://youtu.be/4CUq0ViezBI
ASoftFluffyThing: "Ye olde sweet shops" are all over Britain, mate
Pink3 well an 11 years olds mind is still developing. You wouldnt want that child to be influenced by such a game. Not saying that he/she will shoot people actually. The violent nature of the game is the reason that its rated M and thats for a good reason. Though the APA has inconclusive proof that video games has an influecne. Let me grab a quote real quick.
Shit, sorry chat wall.
:D
Shizuka oh i hanvt played like that in a long time
:D
Serenity, I'm in the US. >>
ill see if i can think of something
ASoftFluffyThing: I think MadSurge is British :P
So there's no other side to the Minecraft Wor'd?
*world
nope
just void
If we do, you MUST
Serenity: I am italiano, grazie tante :D
6I'll try and show you the character too :3
not necicarlly on te violence :P
MadSurge: Could buy a pizza and lodge it on a lolly stick? D:
Dat spelling
Pink3 ^^ as I said its rated M for a good reason.
^
Panda|Drawing: A*
AND I"M ALIVE
Serenity: could, but tomato sauce and sugar don't go well together :D
Zombert, you are?
Damn that eas a rush
Serenity A what?
Panda|Drawing: But it can be skipped the only other sexual content in the game is a woman being "harassed" it oesnt say how :|
Everlasting_Joy: the cash4gold one killed me
Was*
Panda|Drawing: Thought graphic Nudity was A?
So what did I miss
artist: Did you see the "Impact Gel" or "Neverscrubber"?
Zombert, not much. How did it go?
i saw impact gel, not neverscrubber....yet Everlasting_Joy
PAWS
did winds knock out your window Zombert?
I mean ... ponies!
Well my Roommate was upstairs when it happand
Pink3 try the start bytton or escort the little one out of the room. Or mute the television and have him/her turn around ^^
Serenity ESRP standards ^^
I was talking about ESRP
Hooves!
put hooves!
awesome
xD kick me
He said it was a pice of Metal sheeting from some ones shed or something
Hai Everypony ;)
Panda|Drawing Or, y'know, just get the kid out of the room and keep them out.
Zombert: Fluttershy's shed?
Coming up with creative ideas is hard
Because kids ruin games
ouch, glad he didn't get hit with it then
No matter what.
Serenity, my mistake. But no, nudity and other graphic content are M. Anything above that wouldnt be on shelves haha
that's why if I ever wrote anything it would probably be fanfiction >.>
Panda|Drawing: ??? what lttle on :|
DWR, thats a good point ^^
Ya lol but it hit so hard that we need to replace the whole window frame
Panda|Drawing: Ahh okay.
Pink3 you said an 11 year old. there for little one.
children + prized game collection = a bad time
Jesus this is annoying.
I think the rudest game we ever let past was probably Conkers bad Fur Day
Its not the worst
I know it's not
Serenity: but that WAS a rude game :D
That's just first one that comes to mind
Serenity that game escaped my childhood :/ I dont even see how.
MadSurge: Only a little >:3
For n64 standards...
Maybe...
flaccid fexor Everlasting_Joy, that must be outlawed in most states
But in the 90's censorship rules were much different.
artist: :D
6Indeed.. >.<
13http://youtu.be/MRNKXIuPJTw
If Conker was released now, it would probably be banned in most countries
True
artist: Than what the heck is the shake weight doing here?
conker's just crude, not really anything to ban about
Hi everypony
:)
I wrote like half a fanfiction once but it got deleted when I plugged my flash drive into a mac

TheWeatherPegisis: Dont do it bro
Panda|Drawing: Thanks :P for callng me a little kid. I realiz that is what i may be but not there ---> :) (head) mentally i find myself not the average 11 year old. From what ive seen i find myself more mature than some 8th graders. I know i sound like a litle kid, i know i am going through adolesence and you most likely think i am claiming myself this way but i AM different than theese little kids. So it makes me frustrated when adult
Sorry Abut the wall guys :P
