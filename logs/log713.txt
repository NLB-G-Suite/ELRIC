I'll keep to my first person shooter :3
And with that
Time for TF2
O_o
/me Hates mornings -.-
/me loves em
^
/me is sick
:3
My thermometer reads 2
oh well it's 12 here in Christchurch but it's night time
:'( 38 with the wind....I dont wanna go outside
and everyone in the world turns to delicious tang
At the end of all that.
ooohhh 20 degrees tomorrow and it's ognna get hotter
Entirely nothing.
They just want to confuse you, and make you think that something has happened.
^^^^^^^
They're one step closer to something happening.
Doesn't mean anything has happened.
Oh good, something might happen sometime soon, soonish, sooner than it was soon previously.
are you fucking kidding me
Hmm?
action for actions-sense, no plot-dev?
Guys, if you lot are gonna argue and debate, take it to the deathmatch arena
oooh... deathmatch
me gusta
Not arguing.
you guys were showing the movies?
And the result it's come up with is nothing.
Aah
ooh...Celebrity Deathmatch?
Entirely nothing...
^
Remember though, not everything is for everyone
*it in
The only part that by itself doesn't make sense was explained as it was happening.
From the fact that nothing happened.
Oooook
i did too
XD
I've got this shit.
I've seen something like 4 probably.
Huh- me too
Well it was
Hello
:3
/me explodes
This is the reason I don't watch many animes though, a lot of them tend to make no sense to me- and just end up not interesting me
None of the characters actually died in the end
hiya :D
You have to watch from the very beggining :D
:D
:D Me in 10 hours - countdown
Well, I liked some of the ones Isaw
I watched..Death note..scrapped princess..and some others I can't remember
Bye Everypony :)
hmmm, i've got problems with php still
/me likes some yaoi
Goodbye cyp-gone >.<
no one seems to know
that I liked, but- I dunno, it wasn't the best thing I've seen
Hmm, haven't heard of that one
i enjoyed inuyasha
Gurren lagann is my fav anime though
;A;
It's good. It's about a thief and his gang and they're being chased around everywhere by a cop who's obsessed with catching him.
Ooh~~
Ooh, yeah
whats everyone doinggggg
But it's all supposed to be just regular earth.
Lately I'm kind of enamored with feral-furry stories, but there's not many I've found
But yeah, I might check that out- I don't watch a lot of series anymore, but never hurts to try things
Some*
And watch it in no particular order
Aah, that's always a good thing when jumping into long running series
I happen to value continuity in my stories. Episodic series are always stuck in "Status Quo is God" mode.
Which Lupin is. At my last count I think there were like 4 different origin stories for Lupin and his gang
Hehe
O.o
Night everyoneeeeeeeee
byeeee
But that's enough about that. Now I'm babbling. :P
/me wikis both those
I warn you though. The Fujiko Mine series is VERY raunchy
Hehehe
Luckily it's only 13 episodes long
"Because the show airs at 1:29 am,[2] it technically debuted on April 5, 2012."
That's quite some time to air
Yeah
huh?
Since it's 13 episodes-
/me not quite used to the anime world
ahh
I gotta go now school. Laters
There are shorter. FLCL is only 6 episodes long. :D
That series is a complete mind-screw though.
!
It makes less sense than Eva
Hehehe
I have a series on my HD that's 2 episodes. It's even more mindscrewy than FLCL
Never heard of it... Don't think I want to either. O_o
And FLCL pulls that off quite well
Bobobo Bobo Bobo is like that too.
Ohey a stream
FLCL was made as a holiday from Evangelion.
o.o
Sudden omnious Pinano!
Y u scare everyone?
Piano
5 hours \:3/
Oh wait... It's 6 hours
Dem logs, indices and functions aren't gonna work themselves out >.>
stupid apache
i don't want you to run index.php
i want you to tell php-fpm to run it
Wat
Pronounced "Bo b'bo Bo BO b'bo"
that sentence...
soo much invite
I am not kidding
Amazing
I realise but... that sentence
He fights with his nosehair and his fro for the right to have hair
"connection attempt failed"
It's not a sentence. It's his name
/me rolls around
it won't connect :(
Oh lol XD
I only watched the first couple of episodes of it. Mostly to listen to Bobobo's voice.
*watch
Brb putting away pots and boiling some pasta
it is a bit
but i cbf changing the colours
*bed - see all the typos!
Huzzah :3
Oh yeah. Everyone's fighting style has names that start with "Fist of the"
Dat intro music
Covering yourself in tape and slowly pulling it off can be an interesting experience
Fist of the Nose Hari!
hair*
Freeee leg waxing!
score!!!
i think my isp is having routing issues
Apparently not-
Well I need some sleep for tomorrow
Goodnight everyone :)

Netsplit
You were part of the netsplit
Oooh

I'm using mIRC
I actually do have mirc on this computer.
I just don't use it
I use it at home though
it is nice
do I hear haibane renmei?
The music is oddly fitting.
Goddammit, splits.
it would not be crazy to suggest "get used to it"
hurricanes and whatnot
Yes, it is the season for such in America, is it not?
/me looks outside
sure looks like it
good evening
Evenin'.
13or i'm wrong..
what's up?
wait
13when retracting, my bridge goes two pulses then waits the rest of the cycle
13once the light cycle finishes then the bridge starts accepting pulses again
i see frames
13signal comes in here to a toggle latch from the buttons
13it's constantly pulsing one of the frame motors, this just switches which one
13there's a counter set for 8 pulses to control lights up top
hmm
idk myself what's the problem, but i have a friend who's great at these sort of things
shame he's offline >.>
13it doesn't seem to be the problem
13the counter itself has no bearing on the bridge
Sandy?
AYEJAY
13see there?
I'd say second one.
13nothing happens on the return run until the counter turns off the lights
13but that's only possible if that line is getting pulses, which go to the motor
I'm not sure. I'd go with first on eyes, but grin on second.
uhmmm choices choices
Not that I mind.
13think i need to break for now though, get food
13hope ponies enjoyed :)
:3
I do like food.
Thanks Shizuka~
13if nopony takes up i might come back in later
I wish my desktop was this clean.
But I'm just too lazy to clean up.
brb gonna make top ramen
^
Ffuuuu..... i don't want to do a background ..
Gah

I know, use a link shortener. :D
I just didn't know that it would be that long.
Liar.
;~;
LiarjackisAwesome? :D
finally, an Illinois ad
truly, this is the greatest one yet
Hi everyone
Of, well. I guess I'll do it when this thing crashes.
Oh, well*
aww that music is over
Meh. It's just biting cold over here. As usual.
cant wait til next next saturday
!cd
woot woot
No school again tomorrow..THE FUN HAS BEEN DOUBLED!
That would help. All I did was write "no skool" and put the vid on my FB
Or we could just link one. :D
looks like Sandy Cheeks got mad in bikini bottom :/
Well, the emotions available in the embedded IRC client aren't really anything the mods can change.
emoticons*
Holla everypony! :)
no only the webclient
Pondooo
^
/me demands nothing
I don't really want them to cater to the fans.
That'd be terrible.
same
of course it would be horrible
OI
WHY DON'T YOU RESPOND TO ME
Like if they added humans in the show o_o
Oh, absolutely. It's great that they acknowledge us.
Only a little nod to the fans, but VERY rarely.
but yeah, keep us fans away from the writers
^
nooooo
Oi
Meh
yup
Don't want to either.
It's fantastic of them to acknowledge us, but they should only give nods VERY rarely.
I didn't even see the HUB promo for it. :D
I haven't been on EQD for months because they're not very good at hiding spoilers.
I don't want to see promos or anything- I want to be bedazzled and awestruck by all the things
I didn't even want to know the name of the episode- but I lost that battle pretty fast
But soem people go "NUUUU SPOILER!!" during the breaks.
I still go to EQD, but I scroll as fast as I can to avoid anything about the show
I found this place after the derpy thing, then came.
I dunno, I just really want to know absolutely nothing
^
I offically joined this place when I saw the movie night poster on EQD and District 9 was the A movie.
It just kills it for me.
AYEJAY IS STOOPI
D
I have returned with the food of thy gods
Or it ain't food of thy gods.
not see*
I don't want to know the title, I don't see why I "must"
As far as I'm concerned, the title is "Blah Blah Blah, Mister Freeman".
I was like D=! when the !cd revealed the name to me
Cloudchaserrr..
I would glomp....ummmm.....Derpy!
I guess
No doubt. Because she's just that adorkable.
Even thoguh rarity is my fave, she doesn't seem like much of a huger.
hugger*
Also because I'm scared of hugging Pinkie Pie. She'd probably strangle me.
hai everyone!
Hmm... I'd probably have to go with Rainbow Dash, even though she wouldn't like it. XD
AYEJAY
I can stay up and watch ink masters tonight...can't wait!
Ink Masters?
Talking to a wall.
Gfdi
octopuses?
:O It's a tattoo competition hosted by the guitarist of jane's addiction.
The only Inks I know of are the Ink Spots.
ouch!
Y U NO RESPOND
Good.
Has there really not been a stream since I left here.
*?
Cmon, tell me! :p
Dat profile
11AM where?
Profile?
Shhhhh Ayejay
ok
Oh hi, MahB- oh
Ayejay, don't worry.
But the Buffer Show is AMAZING.
Come for the buffer, stay for the ponies
hiya Mah-
why must you taunt me?
This is the episode where we figure out that Lag's secretly cheating on Buffer, and we figure out about Buffer's long lost cousin!
It was quite interesting.
I once hooked up a bass to the TV, that was a fun tv show
Oh wait, It NEEDS it. :D
Whooooo
Alles Gut?
:D
It would be awesome if there was an episode where the mane6's bodies get switched with eachother
Nah, that'd be too predictable.
Wekk, I'm ging ti olay Falliut niw.
maybe :P
Okay, I'm going to try that sentence again.
lawl
/me applauds effort
Misplaced hand syndrome
my tastebuds have been satisfied by the food of thy gods
Ambrosia?
CHOCOLATE MILK >_>
no, top ramen
but I adoore the CMC
applebloom is best cmc
I don't think Trixie is a villain, but I adore her aswell
I'm not suuuree she's a full on antagonist, but yes, something like that
is the stream still on
It's an episode riddled up a bit by their hurried change -
but yeah, I feel bad for her
I wanna hug Trixie and tell her shes awesome at magic x3
O hai
even if she can barely do it lol
She might be pretty talented compared to normal unicorns, but not compared to Twilight- going by her cutiemark atleast
I havent been here for ages now ._.
that feel
I swear... its been a loooong tiem
Hmm?
oh
but I don't think Trixie is bad at magic-
the crowd seemed to enjoy it until she was heckled
Kinda, we were talking abouuut.. something
then trixie happened
I wish I can say that Trixie is best unicorn but Twilight is by far my favorite unicorn and character in the show
We don't know much about it in the show- like, babies have uncontrolled magic, kids have to learn magic, Twilight is exceptional at magic
that's about all we really know-
twilight is best unicorn
^
^
Ahh, empty streams
:<
How I missed you
thast it
Ahh, Empty Spaces.
She's talented and wonderful too
Looks and smarts, aw yeah
Rainbow Dash is best unicorn!
^
Never read that-
ehehe
Snails is best alicorn
luna and celestia are only alicorns
Celestia is best earth pony!
b-b-but Cadance is Cute......
^
I loved Cadance honestly. Her design is one of my personal favories.
favorites*
well, if we consider Twilights flashbacks as canon, she is not immortal
celestia and luna are only alicorns i recognize
also cadances wings look fucking retarded
but I don't consider her a full alicorn, don't mind reading fanfics where hse is though
no time for character development
no
She didn't have much of a role
I still liked her way more than I thought I would
:D
seriously, if they give cadance another episode before applejack
I think she's not an alicorn though- but she's something special
At you.
MEAT!?
Duet though
Applejack is best backround pony.
yea*
Uggghhhh....
She does
She could use it. I mean, she is one of the mane 6.
as mush as rarity's my fav, she's had enough
You eat ponies?
You evil thing.
imo that is
fail!
yeah
But yeah, she had the cider one.
Hehehe
lawl
Yeah last roundup, that was the one I was thinking about
i wasn't aware that apple jack sang in the cider squeezie 6000
Unfortunately, Derpy stole the spotlight. :D
D;
It kinda was yeah
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Rise of the Clockwork Stallions Demo Trailer
Yeah, great episode, but more of a m6 episode I guess
wasn't that S1?
I dunno...
Huh
Ooh, Earthbound?!
earthbound you say?
oh yeah the premiere was great too
o u
I'm sure it'd be effective, though.
nope.avi
chickens are zen.
Chickens are best pony
!
Chickens smell weird and are loud
I forget the name of them, but honestly, they sound exactly like they need WD-40
Oi leave chickens alone.
yeah-
Use to have one for years.
Woo
I like doorknobs :D
ever been to a eh chickenfarm for meat production? Horrrribbbleee
Chickens are lovey
Hah :)XD
Chickens are chickeny
Chickens do resemble chickens, yes.
UM.
I'm sure they taste the part, too.
BAWK BAWWWKKKK
