TOPH<3<3
Only reason people like kora is because it is all modern
that toph
Toph
how come twilight_sprinkle
I love Korras comedy :P
the plot is so predictable
iroh being a boss again
While I like TLA more as of right now, just judging by execution alone, I'd say Korra is better.
IROH!
oh shit
12do you live near cows?
._.
oh shi-
no iroh
alexxm: huge plotholes, absolutely horrible ending, and the generall overpowerness of main characters and Convenient stupidity of others
AH SHIT ITS ROCKMAS
seems legit
Sokka is my fav character :D
Wakin up like a baus
she zapped uncle iroh. why would you do that? you don't zap uncle iroh. that's.... bad
Toph<3<3<3<3<3<3<3

Sokka = Best character

kidzrul434: actually, the studied many existing martial arts
Iroh always speaks wisdom

hi guys
iroh speaks the truth
I just don't know what went wrong
hey icybeauti hows your day been

RAWRity: or rather you express it as if your opinion is ultimately true, and your statements often get offensive

>.>
<.<
Vordox: dude
v.v
i never argued with kirzstryfe Vordox
i would suggest bottom live, but its pretty much dick jokes until Rik Mayall forgets his lines
00,10Vordox, you must not read the anouncmets that Silverscreen has been pluging every movie night
Sumica: Hmm? The playlist?
Meanwhile, what do you think, Carry On, Inbetweeners movie, Doctor Who?
for some reason i want to watch a speed paint
Carry On ^_^
00,10yeah
Doctor Who!
I farted.
DOCTOR WHO
dari: Do I need to give you a reason to put tennant on the screen? :P
Sumica: BUt this is a speed paint, not a song or video.
>11TH DOCTOR
Pfft, yeah right sagas
I think Im gonna watch a long long forgotten cartoon from my childhood until there is a stream.
Get out.
/me slaps DashWithRainbows
sagas: Don't be silly, there is no 11th doctor.
00,10it's still brony made content right?
DashWithRainbows: sorry my hand slipped
Meanwhile: that is sacrilidge
/me throws Bronysith into a blender
00,10I presume speed paint of ponies yes Vordox
my finger slipped
/me pulls DashWithRainbows with him
/me is still listening to the happy birthday song
Sumica: I dunno, since Bronysith is against the art, it's kinda...rude to do it though. even though I'm proud of it. XD
well, got: A stylish Bag, Shampoo, Deo, lots of Choclate, some Chips and money. Nice Gifts ;)
Vordox: dude. i never argued with kirzstryfe . i posted a dumb link and thats it

Ho ho ho ho
DashWithRainbows: yeah i thought id save you from the link
lol sagas
twilight_sprinkle I usually open links with no volume on
just in case
Yeah, in a minute.
sagas: Oi, that isn't how you speak to the streamers.
00,10takes a bit to set up and sync with stream sagas. realx
alright I was just asking. Geesh
DashWithRainbows: ah maybe i should do that too, screamers rarely get me though, i usually anticipate them. however it happened to me twice recently, both from this chat
00,10generaly when we go to stream we have to ajust the way the couputer handles sound
00,10it takes a bit to do that
So lets drink to your fading health and hope you dont remind yourself that your chance at finding fame and wealth decline with every year! :D
^
who else was freaked out by the giant owl
I'm trying to run the stream in a way we haven't tried before

Teach an owl to kill, and hell, thats a grade A assassin :D
Everlasting_Joy: O U

I found it in the attic when clearing it out
Damn, needed cleaning inside and I had no tube cleaners
Sumica: dont the advent already have that ability?
Very_Silly_Filly: I'm guessing its also a weapon from WW2.

Om: No, I really think I will, lol. That one was just a tad bit too far
Oh god Sumica.
Very_Silly_Filly: Weeping Angel one?

Sylandest: Huray!

this reminded me about the pirate roleplayer from bash.org :D
So, I was just banned from Transformice for 168 hours for ban abuse. I didn't use my account so it's not deleted, but I won't be able to reconnect with the server on my computer. Are there any ways around this?
What the fudge is Transformice.

If I complain to the mods they'll just delete my account for ban abuse. But, I'll let it slide and just watch Blink for now.
the whole episode?
:$
It said DANGER! Come on, can't she read!?
blink and you
I know
They ruined them
Inb4 Weeping angel jumpscare
this is a wibbely wobbely episode :3
Letting you see them move just completely ruins everything that's scary about them.
^
Red_Pegasus|RedSpy: timey wimey?
^^
Well she can't read so that warning is no help.
Plus the fact that there are pictures of them ruins the continuity of this ep
ninjaaaaa
BEWARE BEWARE!
DUCK!

Quack
moo

derpy_pony: You are now aware of your nose
Indeed, the Weeping Angels were just shoehorned into the Matt Smith episodes because they were so popular in this one.

THE ANGELS TOOK HIM :(
Power cut out

THE ANGELS HAVE THE POLICE BOX

So you get full atmosphere

Protip, some people haven't seen this before and explaining the episode is spoilers. So knock that off.
Wrek: what game=
it's bacon and applejack
sagas: What do they do to you?
T Doctor
Wrek: whats the name of the tournament?
Very_Silly_Filly shes the only new one who was never romanticaly intreasted in the doctor so thats a plus for me

|Discord|: So ask there.
She's in Scotland.
killerpony7733: which is equivalent to DED
:O
True!
MadSurge: nope she lives on a full life in the past
I see where this is going...
wow paradox
Meanwhile: I thought everyone knew what Dr.Who/a Weeping Angel was?
wait, that is confusing
Stop spoiling! The'll figure it out
kinda paradoxicle
They'll
When the very first doctor said that he would come back
|Discord|: well you apparently don't so that's a stupid assumption.
Well
What is the film called somepony?
sagas: its not kinda its literally paradox
13http://i.imgur.com/DTU3I.png
dinky you're part of those who's spoiling the whole thing.
SirPeckerish: it's a show. Doctor Who (weeping angel episode)
It's not a film. D:
Meanwhile: I knew what they where just not what they do,
:O
What?
Shizuka whats that from?
|Discord|: you say that as if it somehow matters.
Dam I know it XD
There is no 11th Doctor
Shizuka: are you the one that's streaming?
poor guy
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: It happens sometimes
13trailer for quantum conundrum

NO THERE IS NOT
dat angle again...
Don't turn your back
YES THERE IS!

Meanwhile: Well knowing what something is and what it does is deffernet
There is no 11th Doctor
Any objections?

Thought no. :>
13OBJECTION

Where was Gondor when there were no objections?
Nice use of the +m
Objection!
13there was no tenth doctor, they should have started with zero
DUN DUN DUUUUUUN
Shizuka
so close
The zeroth doctor?
That was close :O
THERE IS A 11TH DOCTOR HE IS MATT SMITH
I'm not very aware of things in Doctor who, I've never picked up on the series, but I thought there WAS an eleventh and twelft Doctor.
The 10th doctor is David tennant
*twelfth.
seems legit
Actually the first doctor was a regeneration
Inb4 a boot to the head
There's no 12th yet
The show started years ago, there's been 11 doctors.
Oh u gais
the 9th is Cristopher
So silly
Only 10 Doctors
^
IKR, dari?
9th doc is best doc

You've only got 17 DVDs?

Was this shot with DSLRs...?
Scooby Doo's house. x]

This is not a paradox. This is a STABLE TIME LOOP
"We just made this up, so we can just say it is complicated. Becaus ethis is a trashy b-movie style series"
I don't get anything when I google 11th Doctor
Barbetos|AtWork: when I type that in nothing comes up.
Turns up a blank

Golakka: No one ever figured that out
Time to put it in front of a mirror
wow
Bleh
Just smash it
Lambo: you cant kill stone
can't they just set up a camera? :D
What if you blink one eye at a time?
I haven't even SEEN anything of the "mythical" eleventh doctor so I don't have much of an opinion
they have to maintain eye contact?
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: You can smash it to pieces...
a good grenade could end one of them
Oh my god, what part of "You can't break Weeping Angels" are you missing.
Camera doesn't work
lol poor man
She abandoned her
that's really a bad idea. You don't want to breathe that in
Alchemist they have to be seeing them, not particularly eyes.
dammit, let him ick it in, that's a fucking old door

Dermathil: Doctor Who can do that
Welcome to Bronystate, Dermathil

Love is in the air.
they ducked and looked at the ground.
Lil_B: I'm just kidding with you man
Ring around the rosie

cow224 really :O
FUN FACT: Eyes can't actually see when they stand still. Our eyes constantly vibrate
Doctor is smart doctor
unless the light goes out
Oy
They failed. Lot's.
Lambo: that implies that the eyes of an angel works that way.
Lil_B: naa man I can watch horro movie's I was just kidding brony i love you

I'll just leave this right here http://steamgifts.com

TheWeirdPony: Whats so stupid about dari? there are only 10 doctors after all
alright, now's any time as any to get the heck outta dodge.
Lambo: you only live once. Thats exactly why you shouldn't f*ck it up when you are still young :)

05alexxm: this is the first time its shown on tv in sweden too
i think you said that last night Wrek
Anyone know anyone that does Desktop Pony request? :3
I am not sure how I feel about eSport. I mean, real athletes at least have a physically fit body afterwards...
DED
Wrek: we dont get shit streamed like this where im from...well i dont know cause i dont watch tv
woo
There's a crowd?
05Obsidian yes
05live from dreamhack
dat moment when everyone claps and you have no idea why
ah
05diddutz: cause someone of the players died
diddutz: ikr :D
what chicken
diddutz: Then there is a high probability that you get laid ;)
05im not that into dota myself but it works untill sc2 comes on xD
dat Wrek
i have no idea what is happening on the screen
Lambo: xD
i cant follow dota at all, LoL is much easier to keep track of whats happening imo
Back sorry I took so long :(
diddutz: usually when a enemy player is killed he has to wait for a while and the enemy that killed him gets gold to buy items
same here Alchemist
NEEEEEERDS
Alchemist: me ethier
Lambo: says you
um yay?
http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70228340&trkid=3325854
Lambo: there are gamers that play for money
dat link and quit
I was doing the Homer Simpson
gamer jocks
I think I saw Twilight in the crowd :D
Lambo: I think most people here in this chat are nerds :)
I wish poeple cheered for me TheGreatAndPowerfulT Shamroc and Meanwhile when we play l4d
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Still... I wouldn't want to play for a living
I love videogames myself
Lambo: Winning makes a game worth it
But I want to create something making my money
I CALL BULLTSHIT
Shamroc: be cheatin with soldier
Vordox: zombie bullshit
MTW USED A FRICKING BAD HONOUR STYLE FOR WINNING
why isn't this an olympic sport
LAWL
CAUSE OF BUCKING MONEY
SCREW you Dota 2.
Wrek: is IdrA in the SC2 tourny?
oh god dota
Shamroc: I'm joking man I suck at the game
hello everypony
I can see forever
05Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: i dont know the lineup
me 2
people that play dota become obsessed like with a drug
Hey coyboy
hey coyboy hows your day been
its a sad thing to watch..
oh god i hope Grubby is in the tourny
where did TotalBiscuits sponsored player get to, i forget his name
so why isn't this an olympic sport
alexxm : its been good u?
twilight_sprinkle: The reason I will never play DOTA 2 is because you have to be crazy addicted to have a decent chance. I don't want to play a game for thousands of hours
alexxm: starcraft counts as a sport in south korea
alexxm: dota?
alexxm: cause it hasnt been reconised as a legimate sport..
good coyboy
alexxm right now because Video games are still just "Games" in the eyes of the general public, but i guess many people will have problems understanding whats going on onscreen
05give it a year or so more
Shamroc: hmmm seems legit I'M going to use heavy if we ever get a chance to play agian and i fixed my mic soo yeah
i lov3 you
Lambo: yeah, its also tedious
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG i heard about that
Motor racing will be an olympic sport before this
Golakka: It already is a sport here. :P
alexxm: still going on even with SC2
Maybe not Olympic, but pretty famous
twilight_sprinkle: Real sport gives you fitness and strong body. It shapey your body. I would rather spend those thousands of hours gaining a skill
Star craft a sport wich one the first or second?
05implyign OS is good
Did you watch le Mans last weekend vordox?
cow224: both
You've never heard of NASCAR, Golakka?
Dat check.
oh its Navi
Wait, never mind
50k..
Hey, listen!
The game on my Steam account with the highest hour-count is Natural Selection 2 with 400 hours
NASCAR is NOT an olympic sport -_-
10k a dude
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: That is awesome
05lets see
Lambo: yep. and dota is just...bleh. i know a lot of guys who are hooked on dota/hon/lol, its just sad to watch
belive me, I am a huge motor racing in general fan :p
Lambo: Garry's mod, 1200hours.
IdrA is best player with angry emotions
What's the conversion for sweed currency to usd?
05thats about 7100 $
Wrek: each? or overall

05for 2nd place
Yeah, I realized that a little too late, Golakka :S
Wait what is this Wrek
over all
But 10.000 hours... you can learn every skill there is in 10.000 hours... just chose one
cow224: its a tourny of Dota 2
You should slap yourself for being silly :p

alexxm: =/
Holy fuck, That landwhale

05cow224: its television
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: oh did they get like a surprice or somethins

The future will be funny. We will look at fat guys saying "This guy is doing sports"
cow224: wat?
Meanwhile: living up ta name man
what Darkts3|Drawing|MLG
Wrek: hmmm but like the show
That is one reason we should make the clear distinction of E-Sports
You startin' Shamroc?
05currently its the end of the Dota 2 finals
"This 300 lb guy is an athlete."
You've nothing to say about Babe Ruth?
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: like wy dose he have that big piece paper
05after this its starcraft 2
guy on the right looks kinda drugged
05unless the shedule is lying
Or FOOTBALL players?
05oh and the best part
Meanwhile: i aint starting you starting.....stop startin..ya slag
Lambo: you don't have any say in what an E-Sports is.
cow224: its a check...
Sorry kid
Why are there no large company of heroes tournaments, id be fucking rich
Shamroc: yer mums a slag.
05sicne this is on svt, there will be no commercials
or battlefield 2 :p
Yep Wrek
Meanwhile: nah yer mums the slag
Halo reach tourny =D
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: hahah thats funny
whos commentating the SC2 stuff?
Shamroc: nah. YER mum's a slag.
Commercials? WHAT IS THAT IN SWEDEN?!
Holy fuck, thats like £20,000 or something
Golakka: can it be easily commented on?
Meanwhile...OY stop starting! you slag
Meanwhile: Oh you startin' something?
Dermathil: "What an E-Sports is" - what... I don't even... I do know what seperates e-Sports from Sports
Stop startin Vordox.
Yes, Ver easily Dermathil, moreso than starcraft
Meanwhile: no you stop starting'
05thats roughtly 14.000 $ for 1st place
more tactically based than bumrushing
Wrek: not bad
You stop startin' to start stoppin' my startin' Vordox you slag.
SC1 sure was Crazier than SC2
Who is the SC2 final against?
dis gonna be good
Man If they had competinion for star craft I would so sighn up for them
Inb4 moon, again
whoa
Golakka: Then it is probably not being tournied for being not so recent and for having a not-so-large competitive scene.
Meanwhile: Oh no your mom is a slag, harumph!
Swedish sounds so cute
...and...dutch?
Alienware sucks.... nuff said
SWEDISH
suddenly swedish
Swedish
i only understood Dream arena extreme
05its directly form the tv so :P
I expected a Spitfire voice...
Vordox: be nice
Even back when it was released, there was no competative scene sadly
"Tonight we send E Sport to your casual TV, so I hope you all sit in the couch and explains what is happening for the whole family to get hooked."
Hooked.
i heard hooked
05basically: if you enjoy this with your family make sure to explain it for them
Way ahead of you Wrek :P

"Tell us, how has it been today, Dreamhack Festival seems to be one bigger hit, and it's been a great atmosphere, with great finals."
05recappiong of the dota
He gonna die half way through his sentence
:D
lol
Just kidding
i believe the mans name is alberto del rio
all i'm hearing are metal lyrics. Wrek 's streams ust've brainwashed me by now
"1.500 people in the locals."
I am thinking of buying Payday The Heist right now...
I love co-op
"14 tournaments, with over 3 miljons(I think) total.
Steam Summer Sales starts soon - shit...
... You know Swedish is from the same group of languages as English, right?
They ruined Dead space 3 with having Co-op Campaign
Lambo: woo
05Polydunami: not really
Hm?
cow224: they said they're giving 2 different experiences co-op and no co-op
05more german
Lambo: oh im gonna be broke
Germanic?
cow224: Yeah... I recently finished Dead Space 1. I loved it. Then looked at Dead Space 3 and went all "What the fuck?"
05ic
Steam Summmer Sales? Oh fuck.. my wallet...
cow224: so its like two games
"500 COMRADES, and wonderful to work with them"
This guy is the one holding the StarCraft tournament
Lambo: I know right
05oh they are plannign an e-sport SM
I hope to pick up Anno 2070, Payday The Heist, maybe, Dead Space 2, Left 4 Dead 2 (uncensored this time)
YES Wrek. :D
Wonderful news
On Steam Sale
SM?
English is a language all on its own.
Swedish Mastership

Polydunami: yes. english descended from the anglo-saxons, a germanic tribe, i believe
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: So what you are telling me there is going to be to diffrent campaign storys?
cow224: technically yes
cow224: pretty sure i heard it right
05scandinavia ftw
That is just stuipid

Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Probably in 1 1/2 - 2 weeks Around Juni-July
Lambo: awesome
It was so funny how riot shut down NA LoL server during dreamhack and everyone went to watch it.
Lambo: at least they often have discounts :)
Lambo: guess who had to go on vacation during the sale =*(
05i love how enthusiastic me and vordox are contra the rest of the chat xD
Sorry for everyone here who cannot understand Swedish, we're taking out the important stuff. :P
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Smartphone ;)
Well yeah...we understand what's happening XD
I havent understood a word of this.
Wrek: hmm well to tell you the truth I have never played star craft 2 before only from I heard people say it's not good but is it good cause I am a big fan of star craft (Zergs being the best there is)
Wrek: the rest of the chat have no idea what is happening :D
Wrek: =*(
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: yup
Zerg was best race at SC1
Wrek: not my type of games, but it does seem really exciting :$
BIG news here: BIggest Arena = Might be next Dreamhack, and SC2 Finales in DH MIGHT be sent LIVESTREAMED to several Cinemas
05cow224: well if you havent played it, and onyl heard rumors, you have no reliable gorund to make the claim that the first is better than the second
A'ight. I'm going to take off again folks. I might be back on later, but I won't say with certainty.
WOOOO TOY STORY
WOOOOOOOOOO
I'd be more enthusiastic, Wrek, if I spoke and understood Swedish.
ehehe
Alright, that's out of my system
Wrek i don't speak swedish so i have no idea what eithor of them a saying
We'll take the important parts and translate it. :P
Wrek...why have you not played with me and kirz and a few others?
Wrek: Well I'll bye it and see if I like it do they sell it at steam or can you bye it at like a store?
05alexxm: read the chat, we are takign otu the important shit :P
i'm just listening becasue it sounds neat
cow224: its not on Steam
They are recapping about some players and when SC2 started out in Dreamhack
cow224: its blizzard man...soo not on steam
iN 2010.
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: hmm I'll bye it
Wrek: again..you need to play sc2 the next time kirz gets a game going..or when i bug him to get on
THERE SPEAKIN' IN FANCY D:
Nah, back to my italian gaming podcasts
cow224: terran is op... might as well tell you that
This guy is the one keeping the whole DH going. :p
05Shamroc: US
Shamroc: i love you i told you that yesterday on the game how come you dont love me back
05im on EU
cow224...cause thats just creepy
Wrek: oh yeah that makes sense
Dark_Horst: i can ping myself?
aw
Even so, I'm not completely astounded by e-sports.
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Nope Zergs best charector
Now they are talking about the social parts of how he came into DH and how he got his position.
Right, Steam says we're streaming Toy Story in 5 minutes right?
freaking Blizzard.... not giving local connection
brb
05basically killing time untill the tournament is ready
With some inspirational words for new players that MAY join as well.
Wrek: are these guys doing BF tournaments too? or just small team games?
there have been several problems during tournys in SC2 because foreigns play each other
Fifa had a tournamenet too, and Street Fighter 4.
I live in Canada: most of us are into hockey and football.
We are?
Shamroc: I'm just playing with you man
Dark_Horst: You can PM yourself
Dark_Horst: i dont think theres a BF tourny because it'll be hard to watch 60 ppl xD
Gamex: bleh.,, I was there, wasn't as fun for me as most other things. :P
They are talking abut one of the players of SC2, and how he has good chance to win
Vordox: is it Stephano?
Wrek: wait this turnemet i going to be about star craft right
05yes
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Didn't hear, sorry, bad Mic.
Steam said the next Trilogy was Toy Story
Vordox: awww :'(
And I trust steam
Wrek: Will we be seeingg any zerg Rushes
05best part is commercial free
My steam hasn't said anything.
05TAKE THAT MLG!
i love dose
2 more years of?!
Wrek: IKR
2 more years of SVT2?
05cow224: its top tier pro gamign so... probably
SVT2?
WHAT games will be shown?
Wrek: And its free =)
You sure it's not in an hour and 5 minutes?
Wait, I know what SVT is.
Never mind
Gimme a moment I'm checking
"Mostly the same, "go" is a new game that's getting popular, Dota 2, LoL, Hereos of Neweart, Fifa and SF4 and SC2 will probably keep strong."
okay, my attention died. See you guys tomorrow. Good Night everyone!
Wrek: awesome I cant wait well I don't understand what they are saying but when they play I'll no what they are doing cause it's star craft after all
Fuck da police!
Wrek: guessing you are eager for Heart of the Swarm?
The expansion of SC2 has some worries that may change the game of SC2, but they have high hopes.
05turtlegod98 is makign no sense
turtlegod98: what you say
05Shamroc: aye
i know
Vordox: IKR
That's the usual time.
Well now it say it's at 6
Even with Expansions... Terran gets more OP
im so weird :S
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: We'll see.
Also
Is that Eastern or Central time?
"DO NOT BUCK WITH SWEDISH TEENAGERS; they create mods and hack stuff and make games that becomes big hits" :P
Zergs are awesome I dont like protopes they are like a cheating swarm when I play with my brother we go 1v1 on starcraft he always win cause he uses them and cheats well he dosent cheat he just has skills
Protoss kinda has nothing to gain
Wrek: the live comment will be in english, right?
Now they are talking about upbringing and Internet for children, knowing WHAt they are doing online,, keep an eye."
reply to this if you think im stupid.
Dark_Horst: Yes
05Dark_Horst: yes
nice
05imagine this
nopony?
05the actual game stream is in english
Nope, still Swedish crap
The new younger kids that join DH need to have the parents atleast keeping an eye out for what is happening with them here, etc etc.
05and universal
See you in an hour than
Wrek: wait the comment is going to be in english yes
ok
05but right now its the side cam that is in the country's specific language
I'm AFK. Ping me if you need me. :)
MURICA!
Okay, it's midnight now, it should be starting any minute
LOL!
HAhaha XD
That's one GG
All I heard was "Gg, well played"
^
They had one tweet where a police was called at the DH, and one of the Twitters said "GG well played" after they removed the person :P
Vordox: Lol
05PvZ
Internal Joke dat.
05mana dimaga
Wrek: woo
It'll be entertaining, but they have some hardships lately.
Koreans and Swedish didn't keep the pressure up and underperformed.
this is a pretty long break.....
05appollo commentates
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Oh shush :P
05and someone else
05missed the name
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: it IS live.
Vordox: i knows
Heh
Bias announcers. :P
Wait whut
yay i can find the stream now
GG wheets?
Wrek: if you don't mind me asking is the competion going to be like hmm I don't no how to ask this like how many players are going to be in it and what ytpe of game type like 3v3 or lik 6v6 or free for all
type
05always 1v1
cow224: 1v1 PvZ Finals I think
05any higher and its no longer competitive
dude... no accent.
What then I missed the little compiteion aww man
she's good
Dark_Horst: no accent whatchu talking about?
Oh
05she has a hefty accent
well, barely
Vordox: hmm then I guess
Oh, dammit... Mafia 2... Alan wake... so many games I will buy in the slae
*sale
Wrek yeah bit its not that bad
a bit*
05never said it was bad
Wrek: apearantly i just caucht the two sentences where it was inaudible. noticing it now too^^
Wrek you should hear danes
Ah just det, I don't need to translate. XD
The old fun times...
When Swedish BECAME GODS IN GAMING
/me coughs.
05well
hehe
05i think its more liek this
05the pros are always the pros
05the tournament winners and all
05adn their countries
05but say sweden and korea the general skill may be higher than others. but that doesnt give us any more pro players
05if that makes sense
It's all circumstances
Internet goof.
Stable now? O.o
gawd the chat is filled with R.I.P Day 9
djWHEAT?
Meanwhile: Some famous dude within ESport
Meanwhile: I know you sall that to
I still think it was a dick-move by Valve to register DOTA as a trademark
It just grows and gets larger and larger.
Lambo: Money
Lambo: its F2P
Lambo: they said it
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: They will make TONS of money with Dota2 DLC
=/
wow coke
This must be totally legit.
lol Nikes sponsoring a tourny
...sponsors didnt notice thta yet? boy, these guys are slow on the uptake
"Look, I could have been thin, but I became an eAthlete"
Sponsor is the reason we have what we have now
thank god
AMERUCAIAAA
MURICA
Oh hai Sweden being best
etc etc
ESport Bubble?
is that a closeup of mr bean?
05maybe
Yes it is
With Day Z I think my idea of a game would be possible. Why not have a Battle Royale game with an island and 50-100 survivors? Last survivor wins. Random weapon spawn. Battle Royale: The Game
:P
we need more starcraft fans in this >.>
05aye xD
Lambo: meh
YES WE CAN
WE CAN CHANGE
Wrek: O_O what is this?
Vordox is way too into it, haha
Lambo: I love Gaming Scenes
05lvie television Panda
05live*
I do't mind it, big time
And yeah that too :P
Vordox: I love the indie scene
hi guys
whats on?
FIRST OFFICIAL SVT ESPORT moment
BIG stuff for us Swedish Gamers
Wrek: i was gonna ask the channel but then i remembered you are over seas XD
So guys, how you all love the commercials? :P
night guys
Night alexxm!
/me dies waiting
lol CoD
Dark_Horst: XD
DaktIt's true...
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: It's true...shit games.
TOO OFTEN games released = TOO bad and will outgrow in months
05the games that last are the games that go esport
05ie not cod
Indeed
Wrek: mmhmm
you know, BF3 tounraments would be possible. you'd just have to pick the small map sizes
00,10new fun trick as tec, put bording partys on retreating fleets
MAAaaaybe Bf3 Wrek
BF3 wont be esports
05im very sceptical against bf3
Sumica, you playing SOASE rebellion? :3
BF3 has teamwork in big focus
in BF3 ppl will have to watch 64 ppl
it'll be hard to tell what happens
Wrek: it could work. 8vs8, 2 squads on each side
Which can become BIG time teamwork ESport
bf3 is definately not esports
its just pretty
poor gameplay overall
Dark_Horst: BF3 has huge maps =/
Hehe!
05Chrysalis<3
Is the stream getting quieter or is it just me.
GIVE US QUAKE tournament!
let's take MLP:Fighting is Magic to eSports
Chrysalis: better than CoD
The Quake games are still not avaible in the german steam Store - that is laughable
ORIGINAL 1v1 aspect of Quake!
<3
I don't like moder warfare at all
Chrysalis a turd on the street is better than cod
battlefield... poor gameplay... you're cute
Do it, Sweden
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG*
Dark_Horst <3
05cow224: you jsut said motehr warfare in swedish
05mother*
Awwww
05xD
Chrysalis: xD
Lol cow224 XD
let me guess, next you gonna tell me tf3 is the only quality shooter
Wrek: re-really I did
Miniweed?
*tf2
cow224: MW was great... then it started being the same
Vordox: haha
Oh hai Swedish
Is she a native swedish speaker?
Another girl?
Impossibru
05Lambo yes
Madelisk, Pro Gaming SWEDISH girl
05to both
She is even pretty
Starcraft for newbs...
XD
she's purdy
05they are now explaining sc2 in swedish for the tv audience
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: I like 1 and 2 but three was just the same like any thing
Explaining the game for the families
Storecroft. Fer newwbs
females... quick, tag them. i get the stun rifle
cow224: i wanted it to finish the campaign =/
Don't feck with Madelisk...even I heard of her name.. She was one of the main players of E3
=P
Wrek: Well, the very blonde one sounds to me like she isn't one
Anyway
=/ its been 40 minutes
05Lambo: different dialect
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: I loved the moder warfare 2 campaign it was amazing
We have about 12 different Accents in Swedish with big differences.
cow224 really?
cow224: mmmhmm Mw2 was great
The SC2 montern is starting, get ready!
08,01wheee
it was rather dull when i played it
yayayayayay SC2
Now she's uses Swenglish words. XD
Chrysalis: yeah It was awesome
08,01esports?
05tune into the stream
08,01is that like escorts, but sportier?
cow224 but there was no story, no plot, no charachter development
So strange that even Japan does not have such a huge eSports scene
Lambo: Indie choices and arcades.
Chrysalis: so your saying every CoD sucked
Explaining the different game strategies
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: I know the part the hit me was when you are roach and sheperd just shoots you like nothing and he kills you and ghost
every cod since blackops sucks
For Mama and Dimaimgaia whateer
Chrysalis: lol MW 2 was before Black Ops

Dimaga has a huge chance of using Banelings.
mana FTW
Vordox: hehe overlord drop?
the only good cod was mw1. cuz it'S campaign wasnt compeltely blown over the top and actually interesting
Chrysalis: hmm yeah I think the whole plot was to stops sheperd from makeing a nuculer warfare but i dunno no but still it was awesome
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Big chance.
08,01they're talking in moonspeak
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG and i was just writing an amendum which included mw2 in that statement
I know some gamer girls who play Modern Warfare and Black Ops excessively... But nothing else
MW was a great game
i enjoyed mw, i enjoyed blackops
Shame about it's fanbase.
Prepping up
05enjoy commercial free swedish television
MW and MW2 and BO where good. MW3 not so much
but mw2, mw3, blops and blops 2 all look so poor
Chrysalis: Black Ops sure had a great story
Wrek: What is this..."commercials" you speak of?
I am insanely bored now, so TF2 time.
BO2 will be great
08,01my god

Dark_Horst: /) kids (\
08,01Wrek: do they speak german at all in sweden?
>.>
05Kandarihu: svt is always commercial free
"We are waiting for SC2 finales, keep around on site and chat with other gamers."
How is it funded, then?
08,01we have the BBC here, which is commercial free
05its absically trhe unofficial second language
08,01oh, okay
Vordox: thanks
05Kandarihu: part of the tax

Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Nah, it's between Dimaga and Mama
How are the taxes over there?
:P
Vordox: oh just these 2?
Kandarihu: 33% around
08,01Wrek: wait, hang on, so this is actually being broadcast on real, proper TV?
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: It's the finale, aye
Dat kick
08,01bloody hell
DAMNIT WREK, make me a mod :P
Dat wombo combo.
...
05Kandarihu 33% is income tax.
Vordox: nice to know terran didnt get in finale for once =)
Well, if everyone's paying for SVT, I'd hate to be an anti-gamer living in Sweden.
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: They ever was ? :P
05lower if you earn under a certain ammount and higher if you earn over a certain ammount
Kandarihu: ALOT of the tax goes everywhere, it's a %
Vordox: idk terran is usually at the finales
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Never seen them win imo :P
05the same tax funds police, fire, medical
05so on so forth
Oh yeah, Wrek, don't forget the TV license
05its basically tax
YAY
05but "optional"
Which is negliable anyway
08,01it blows my mind that this is basically being broadcat on the Swedish version of BBC
Fun fact. I miss commercials during these downtimes. :P

Meanwhile: Most Koreans got their arse beat in DH.

wooooo 6 gates
Dat forge build u...
Usually with sports it's kind of easy to see and appreciate how good someone is, and see that they're another tier of athelete compared to normal people. With a game like this, unless you know the game, and know how hard it is, or how 'normal' people play it, it's kind of hard to judge how good these people are.
05mhm
Vordox: I'm just surprised by how long this match is, at Blizzcon is was domination so quick.
Meanwhile: Welcome to DreamHACK :P
Yeah, commentary is just like a normal sport, which is interesting. XD
oh boy, zerglings

05well
05lets see
Im back
/me 08,01is adding Sweden to his places spreadsheet
But to live...at minimum?
08,01indeed
About 7k Kr would be ideal for minimum.
05as a student you can manage with around 7-8000 amo nth
If you get a 1 Room apartment, that can cost anywhere from 2k-3k
Or you could go Dorm, which is 3k, but it takes in Water and electricity(And some Internet for free)
<.<
"finally"?
wat
08,01Wrek: awesome; i'll certainly look into it
String_Shredder: Ouch.
String_Shredder: well its a island

My childhood has a wakeup call too.
The CGI of the times meant that the humans look as plasticy as the toys.
1,11For a 3D kid's movie from the early 90's, the 3D for this film is pretty damn good. He'll, it'd pass as a decent movie by TODAY'S standards. o.o
Later Wrek

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Tom Hanks recorded his dialog during the breaks of Sleepless in Seattle and A League of Their Own.

Buzz is the Bronies, Woody is the haters.

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Tim Allen has said in many interviews that Pixar originally wanted Jim Carrey to voice Buzz Lightyear and Paul Newman to voice Woody, but they couldn't due to the low budget they were given for the film.

Um, I haven't seen TS3 yet.

Dat Wizard of Oz refrence
lol
That dog has the weirdest fur texture
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: What attracted Tom Hanks to the role of Woody was the fact that, during his childhood, he would always wonder if his toys were alive and moved around when nobody was in his room. What attracted Tim Allen to the role of Buzz Lightyear was the fact that, before him, they offered the role to his biggest influence in his career, Chevy Chase, who turned it down.

FORESHADOWING
xD
and sadness
Better than being made in China
This song :(
This song... :'(
Tim Allen is Taiwanese?
better there then China
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Buzz Lightyear's facial features are loosely based on those of the film's director, John Lasseter; most notably his eyebrows, cheekbones and the dimple in his chin. Lasseter demonstrated this by sketching a rough self-portrait of himself on the U.K. breakfast show The Big Breakfast and then adding the spacesuit helmet to transform himself into Buzz.
RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Ummm... Im not Silverscreen.

This scene gets even more sad
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Originally the main character was going to be Tinny, the title character in Tin Toy. He would have gotten lost during a family trip and joined up with a sarcastic ventriloquist dummy in a search for a home. Eventually, Tinny was replaced with a toy astronaut named Lunar Larry, which then became Buzz Lightyear. The dummy, meanwhile, was given the identity of a
1,11cowboy, eventually becoming Woody.
Holds VenHur96 Sakari and Obsidian and cries with them. :'(

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The carpet in Sid's house is modeled after the horrible carpet in the basement of the house Pete Docter (writer/lead animator) lived in as a child. When Buzz gets wacky at the "tea party" he calls himself Mrs. Nesbit. The name of one of Pete's grade school teachers and in college, he had a Toyota pickup truck pretty much like the one the pizza delivery guys used.

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: John Lasseter always wanted Tom Hanks to play the character of Woody. Lasseter claimed Hanks had "the ability to take emotions and make them appealing. Even if the character is down-and-out and despicable." Early test footage, using Hanks' voice from Turner & Hooch, convinced Hanks to sign on to the film.
i think he should have been banned on name alone ;0

Silverscreen You know its possible that some of the cutie marks where inspired by this film.
Eggman went into moving?
http://i.imgur.com/jCrJx.jpg
THEY IS THE EGGMAN
solution is so obvious ..
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The moving company ("Eggman Movers") is named after art director Ralph Eggleston. The license plate of the truck ("MLY1K9", meaning "Molly, one canine") is a reference to Pixar's resident sheepdog.
Barbetos: That would make sense
Who is streaming by the way?
13okay, try connecting now
I am dah Eggman, I got the master plan!

or one slow truck
First game ever was Pokemon Red for the Old Black and Green GameBoy
I love ya brother!
Shizuka yay ~ Thanks :3
ouch
INb4 sad music
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The filmmakers have indicated in interviews that the moving-van chase scene at the end of the film was partially inspired by the toy train chase scene from Wallace & Gromit in The Wrong Trousers. The Pixar animators considered the toy train sequence to have set a standard for action which they had to surpass in this full-length computer animated film.
Jaketehsnake: first game I can remember fondly and beating was Kirby's Dreamland for the gameboy
The truck's practically empty!
DocSane: last truck
Silverscreen: RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: In the scene where buzz is pushing to the tool box it says Binford Tools. What TV show also had Binford Tools in it? :P
Shizuka: Apparently, bad server address.
Silverscreen: I loved that movie too
DUN DUN DUUN!
Silverscreen: I knew that scene looked familiar in some way!
Ponies47: Home Improvement with TIM ALLEN
SACRIFICE lol
First game i can remember i think was Wolfenstein 3d and the Commander Keen games

That cheesy one liner.
1,11owns the Barbie character, declined on the basis that they thought the film would be a failure and that they didn't want Barbie to have a defined personality, preferring to let children imagine Barbie's personality traits on their own. Thus, Barbie was dropped from the script, and her character was reworked into that of Bo-Peep. When the film proved a huge success, Mattel did allow Barbie
Wait, what happened to the RC car?

SuperBrony64: no, it clogs the pores I think
Luna is the new Balrog.
08,01otakon: stop what?
SuperBrony64: so rarity does that?
I didn't really feel anything from Over The Hedge. It's one of Dreamworks' weaker movies, to be honest. Now, How to Train Your Dragon...THAT was a terrific movie.
SuperBrony64 lol is that from Ed Edd n Eddy?
Silverscreen: I agree the idea and the characters are creative but i think they should have worked on the jokes a little more
SlurryMoon: thanks for teh stream man, even though I missed most of it
Shit! INTERMISSION DAMMIT!

BEACAUSE TOOTHLESS IS ALL THE DAWWWWW
Creepy baby
this is scary
This thing always made me play with my toys more gently as a kid.
Headcanon, Babby is a young Andy
dat ugly babi
I'm guessing this is very early pixar?
killerpony7733: it's early CG, this was hard back then
OH MY GOODNESS GOD 0_0
Reikim: I agree. He'll probably take on several other completely different levels of creepy before he becomes cool. But he'll get there.
00,03RETREAT!

SlurryMoon, It isn't?
SlurryMoon: TIN TOY thank you... and it's not the first CG short they did?
I dont like this short because the baby makes me cry when he falls :(
box is best toy always
3no, I'm going to show you the first Pixar short here after this one
Is that box a space ship?
Everything went better than expected!
And now he's disappoint.
Now he's jealous
Oh, he's just like a cat. You buy it a toy and it plays with the box
Lesson learned, boxes are MORE fun than the toys that come in them.
Isn't that the one with the bee Slurry?
Atleast you tried :D
3Tin Toy actually was the short that goes along with Toy Story
SlurryMoon: That would be...the one with the lamps. Luxo Jr.
:D
3No, it's not Luxo Jr. either
SlurryMoon, Oh. I thought this was first. I have been wrong before. Thanks for the clarification
Dude I loved playing with boxes when i was a kid

So much yay

Shortest short ever!
00,03Short Short was Short
The mods were playing DOOM 3, seemingly in honor of the Alien trilogy. If I could at least make a suggestion on a game to play in honor of the Toy Story trilogy, it would be Gotcha Force for the GCN.
when they say short they mean it haha
StinkomanFan: naw, that'S wasps
Back. :)
WASP will fuck all your shit up.
Kandarihu: Hm? What was that?
Krusty: the hell was that

dem teats
wow, she's stacked
I think they edited that later
oh god, I remember this one. watched this ages ago
in fact
I still feel bad for the snowman.
3Just so you know, I'm going to show all the Pixar shorts throughout the week minus the ones that were made from already existing Pixar movies like Mike's New Car or Burn-E
I"M SURE THEY EDITED THAT
Them boobs.. :D
wat
This is the original
Knick Knick :D
BOOBS
It's this obscure game by Capcom. It sort of plays like Virtual On, but it's pretty simplified. And it's all toys fighting each other in places like kids' rooms and city streets. It's more fun than what most reviewers gave it credit for.
I LOVED MIKE'S NEW CAR!
Wait didn't they censor this later on?
yeah, I'm damn POSITIVE that later on they made her boobs MUCH MUCH smaller
I don't see any boobs.
SCIENCE!
Where does he get this stuff?
awww i liked burn-e
Litwick: they made her flat
Polydunami: Look at the girl again
KABOOOM\
Polydunami: that one ornament is huge
This will end well...
must be one of the fallout style snowglobes can stand a nuclear blast
My fav pixar short is the one with the old man and the game of chess :)
... Still see nothing I recognize as boobs.
inb4 it no break
HA!
lol snowglobe

even though it's not really true animation... more like some kind of stopmotion
SlurryMoon: Can I request a video?
Bunny_Maid_Luna Herro ^-^
People make fun of bronies, but seriously, do you know of any other fandom that puts out such quality fanworks on such a regular basis?
Red_Pegasus|RedSpy: Running off a playlist. No requests
I think not.

Happy trees

GabeMoist: I didn't say the remixes were BAD. I mean, half my music is Touhou mixes. What really blows me away about Bronies specifically is the animation. Although stuff like Bad Apple is also very high quality.

Hey GabeMoist. Congratulations on winning the A Movie
SWALLOW IT!!!

Please tell me people know where this comes from?
SWALLOW IT PINKIE!
Well then.
Powerpuff Girls, episode Supper Villain
Reikim, well Touhou also has several fan-made animes, while they're not as many, I think some are better quality than MLP animation
killerpony7733: PowerPuff girls
killerpony7733: Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends.
Yay
enjoy this
OH GOD
enjoy it
MY NAME IS PINKIE PIE
How Pinkie Pie is. That's me in a nutshell :(
Oh jesus
OH GAWD
EPIC VIOLENCE
good song. TERRIBLE GAME
my name is pinkie pie
And then blood
lol :D
GabeMoist: Oh, yeah. Seems I forgot those. Actually, some of them really ARE good.
Reikim: no sir you are wrong it was from powerpuff girls
And then Pinkie goes to skyrim jail.
That's just my opinion
And fails to pick her way out.
oh God
killerpony7733: ...I hate myself now.
I still need to get and try out Skyrim.
Bronysith: I got it on console...WHY ME!?
smile : D
Reikim: it's ok *hugs*
its not terrible, just overused/played/marketed
FUS RO PARTY
Dat hiss
|Discord|: its such a horrible game. why would u get it?
Reikim, Memories of Phantasm is specifically what I was thinking of
this is the video that made me a brony
Pinkie arrow
:(
Bronysith: It is a great game
See, this would make me want to get Skyrim.
|Discord|: you agree with millions of other sheep
dat hoofbump
BRB. I gotta refresh.
Bronysith: You can cut heads off.
This video is really half of the reason that this song is my favorite.
Red_Pegasus|RedSpy: i can explode heads in fallout 3
Bronysith: No I have played it and I find it OK. But I stoped playing it cause of the fact I became maxed out
Red_Pegasus|RedSpy: and their torso and their limbs
BACK :)
/me Hugs Ponies47
Partien Cannon ball..... FUS RO SMILE
I stopped playing Skyrim once I beat Alduin
Bronysith: draugh can't be dismembered though and some other critters etc
Red_Pegasus|RedSpy: in skyrim you can just cut off their heads. fallout 3 is much better
Ponies47: Back of your back
I felt done by then
bronysith: But, can you have Pinkie Pie armour?
Hugs Bunny_Maid_Luna back :)
Man, I'm laughing out loud at this right now.
Red_Pegasus|RedSpy: why would i have pinkie armor when i can have all of them anytime i want
i love this vid
Bronysith: And if it is THAT bad...how did it win so many awards
Pinkie WOULD take on a dragon using herself as a weapon.
so much pinkie pie
|Discord|: pay offs
the guy who made this and the mod is absolutely genius
Though, I did make a new character and went straight to Riften and focused solely on Thieves Guild and completely ignored main story
Dat beating beat
Bunny_Maid_Luna: Are you ok? I mean that evil tree. :(
Bronysith: Bethasda has standers. They would never do that
:O
Bronysith: Why wouldn't you want Pinkie armor?
|Discord|: not that hard to slip a couple much of money to some rating companies. Mass effect 3 got a perfect 10 on game informer
Red_Pegasus|RedSpy: cause i can wear fluttershy armor
come to think of it
Ponies47: I'm alright,you saved me :) Thank you,hero :)
/me wishes he had the pc version of skyrim
Bronysith: So you hate the game for what reason?
This!
Bunny_Maid_Luna: YAY! :)

:D
idongetit
Bronysith: You can not complain about the memes, that was the communtiy. Second the view is bad I know but most of the game is pretty damn good. I love the fighting and I think if you do the side missons the normal story will be ok.

Kandarihu: i know. but people wont play them nowadays cause of the graphics

XD
A wolf is my fav. animal :)
Bronysith: if they had shitty graphics thousands of people would complain. If not and went with an OK story line only a couple of people would complain.
SlurryMoon: i want 3 derp moon, so bad...

I remember when the NES was the current system. Game devs were hacking the hardware since SMB1 and it kept getting prettier and more fun at roughly the same rate. Then the SNES came, and the dynamic stayed the same.

Then Nintendo screwed up royally with the N64 and alienated gamers, and Sony swooped in with their Playstation. FMV became a factor and that's when the quality of gameplay and graphics become decoupled

Ingwaz: Me neither

lol
hah
lol

But I'm getting sidetracked. I remember when graphics and gameplay were pretty much equivalent. Later on, games with pretty graphics became indicative of relying on the graphics to cover up unoriginal and tepid gameplay.
XD
hello
XD
Iron_Edge: If you weren't one of those, then you shouldn't get offended. Unless memes are more importants then basic civilities to you
I think the stream has derped for me.

SANDVIIIIIIIIIIIIIICH! WHERE?!!? :o

this reminds me of a really sweet comic i saw with octavia and scratch as roomies, it was about why octavia was friends with scratch even though they were so different. it was heart attack inducing levels of sweet and d'awwww
thank you for leaving advertisement
Ok no more canterlock :$

Oh man.

Iron_Edge: I don't care if I'm rude. If you can't say your opinion, what's the point of having one

9.999.
Pi.
08,01tau = 2 * pi, and makes a *lot* more sense
Iron_Edge: If you think I'll censor myself to be polite then you clearly shouldn't call me bro

:P
Alister: Guess I shouldnt.
08,01Iron_Edge: well, trees as in weed
Alister: you can show your opinion without being a dick

that is how many numbers of pi i know
so why does spike have no chatroom box anyway?
What's this scrillix or somthing
Capn_Gavn: I know , What I'm saying is : If it requires me to be a dick , then so be it
08,01http://tauday.com/ <-- read/watch

3I'm going to skip this video since it's just a song, okay?
OK
Alright then
xxMoopyxx: it's a page for people to go to if they want to see the stream without opening the IRC too... if they want to avoid the IRC or just use their own client.
08,01sagas: why?
spike doesnt have a chat box so people who use an outside IRC program dont have two IRCs going at the same time
oh ok just asking
lol
inb4 creepy
Discord : I'd like to believe that , but some of the idiots I met cannot understand me. You have to be straight to the point sometimes
