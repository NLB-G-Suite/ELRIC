there was nothing to that campeign in terms of substance
every cod since blackops sucks
05mana and dimaga
mana FTW
the only good cod was mw1. cuz it'S campaign wasnt compeltely blown over the top and actually interesting
08,01they're talking in moonspeak
Saturn: It's swapping any second
i enjoyed mw, i enjoyed blackops
Shame about it's fanbase.
Prepping up

05Kandarihu: svt is always commercial free
How is it funded, then?
05Saturn: some may. but english is very much more dominat

05yes Saturn
Saturn: Yes
Dat kick
Dat wombo combo.
...
Well, if everyone's paying for SVT, I'd hate to be an anti-gamer living in Sweden.
05lower if you earn under a certain ammount and higher if you earn over a certain ammount
05but "optional"
Which is negliable anyway
08,01it blows my mind that this is basically being broadcat on the Swedish version of BBC
05we have 3 different BBC's saturn
Saturn: Not even close.
quad = 4
05Quadrenaro: swedish television
ok
you know... i actually find myself wishing i ws there. and i never thought much about e-sports

renaro = 42
Inb4 boot to the head
i'ma turn my colour off :P
/me 08,01starts looking into PhD opportunities in Sweden, just out of interest
In the USA, we have PBS. It's also commercial-free. It's funded by people individually donating to support shows during telethon times.

05Kandarihu the games play too differently to be a spinoff
05both are jsut rts's
Shizuka..indeed hmm?
This mindgame. XD
I just know it
08,01this is fascinating
Really?
If one of them were Korean then they'd have already won.

Saturn: It's more....erm..unstable atm
/me 08,01is adding Sweden to his places spreadsheet
But to live...at minimum?
08,01indeed
About 7k Kr would be ideal for minimum.
05as a student you can manage with around 7-8000 amo nth
If you get a 1 Room apartment, that can cost anywhere from 2k-3k
05btw saturn if aparment maybe i could finally move out xD
<.<
"finally"?
wat
08,01Wrek: awesome; i'll certainly look into it

057000 is around 640 £
Oh, pounds.
08,01aye; that's not too bad
058000 around 730£
Saturn: There's alsoo the other thing you need to think about
08,01the only thing is, i'll need to have a part time job while i study
Saturn: If you do go education, you can take student ..."bidrag" and Loan.
MadSurge:later bro/)
08,01bidrag = loan?
05more like allowance saturn
Bye bye *goes in sleep coma*
No, there's a payment for studying in Sweden
05but instead of from the family
Saturn: no
05its from the state
