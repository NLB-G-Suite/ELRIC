Oh my
I am not joking either. Why watch it if it makes you ill?
eeyep
BGM time?
Oh yes
feh
Well this is interesting.
kinda reminds of Fantasia
00,10what do you meen /just/ back ground
its BG
This episode makes me feel sad. I mean, the lack of education apparent in most ponies...
hmmm
i see
This episode has some fantastic BGM
The ambienance is louder than the talking.
Er ambiance.
This is the episode with the vocals stripped away.
ok this really reminding me of Sorcerer's Apprentice :D
you know...this does draw to my attention just how much work the BGM people put in to this show
Well, the MAIN vocals
Wait
Well, the music is very incidental though. At least it's not constantly loud like how some studios do it.
ALL the voices
FRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

THUNDER MADE MY STREAM GO BUFFER!

00,10the crickets sound like the larva from hl2
And since they are limiting the series to 13 episodes a season I'm not willing to make that trade off
0,14good night everyone and enjoy the stream
yeah
I am enjoying it :P
Luna has the worst timings.
I am taking it slow.

Tell me about it.
Because sleep is never important.
And don't let anyone ever tell you otherwise.

Nuuuuuuu, Rose is ded! D:
Thus... a LOT of people pay for that, and also the licence covers a lot of popular imports and te like.
No music would make this scene much more potent
Dat security
Lol. Nice security
I was talking about the scene where Rose got vaporized, but a lot of scenes work
Holla everypony! :)

END OF SERIES
^
End of season, you mean,. Fun fact-- Eccleston 's contract was for One Year-- because he'd decided to play the role for only one year, since he had other commitments-- but he had to take the role just once.
Now, why don't they ALWAYS carry a gun to kill Daleks instead of comically running away from them? :D
Wow, Nine has a huge nose

Some implied romance, but not a lot
I have read Night's favoured child (so far) and about 6 others
/me has read far too much fanfiction
Nights favoured child was pretty good

it fits the mood-

Must be
00,10soooooooo, where do pony vikeings get leather?
00,10next we need pony in glass armor
There's a bit of romance, but it tends to take a back seat
00,10seeing as this one seems to be in banded
I don'tmind romance, but I don't want it to be the main focus. NO PWP
I adooore romance, but in a fic like FoE it's kinda best as motivation or..backseat
Greetings!

Like Little Pip's drug addiction, and the end- I really liked
basically I am absolutely fine with romance, but I hate the ones that think that PWP is ok
Yes, yes.. Hello.
What's up¿
and romance-containing ones?
Damn straight
Like you said, the story arc with Pip's addiction. That had me glued to the screen
00,10this saterday, yeah
00,10mind you they have reaired it like 3 times already
Most of those never become very popular anyway
That's actually pretty realistic. Most addicts don't realize they have a problem until they find out they've been going through 4 packs a day
i can truly and honestly say i read romance reports for the plot. ACTUAL plot
Like me. I know my nick isn't that diffrent buy hey I'm the only Ponies(Numbers here) :3
