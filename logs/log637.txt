That's too much work.
SpeedyBolt: seriously that's all you have to do
Funny time to come back
SpeedyBolt: well it was the era of grinding man it is a NES game
I'd rather waste my money, to be honest, Otakon.
GODDAMIT MEGANEKKO MAN

Kinixys: a sith with a lightsabre would kick its ass
^
Yay~
I mean, Ness' dad is god tier.
EVERY
SINGLE
TIME!
I do and don't want to play TF2. This show is keeping me glued to the stream 6_9
I remember the first Mother.........so much level grinding......:D
AJIsAwesome|Homework: eeyup but that's how RPG's were back then
00,10yay
I never beat the first Mother.
I got to some kind of tunnel, then Tarantula, and then I got scared and never played again/
Eh
RoboGerbil: Sith mecha. That's a scary thought. Queue that up for Episode 7.
Sestuna: IM SO ALOOOOOOOOOOONE
From Yugioh

/me giggles.
00,10I am sure if hea asked nicely lockon would let him play with his balls
oh lol
...GODDAMMIT SUMI.
Sumica: :D
apparently ninten's and ness' dads have un limited mony and enough trust to trust 10 ( ? ) year olds with 100s of dollers -__-
You're a poo ;3;
as in pooland?
Slide!
SpeedyBolt: If its any consolation. I stopped playing OOT until 2000 because of the Re-Deads. And then Wind Waker scared the crap out of me too. I flung my controller...
President Poopert
gold: Tell that to an 11 old kid that managed to take down a world wide criminal organization alone.
you know it
oni_link: I feel your pain...
oni_link: I killed all the re-deads in the town when I was 5, and I still brag about it to this day
"AAAAAH"
I had nightmares for weeks, though
Milk. GOOD FOR THE BONES.
SpeedyBolt: IMO the Wind Waker Re-Deads were the scariest because of the way they chomp on you and their scream. >.>
LadyStratos: RANDOM CAPSLOCK!
00,10I was expecting a weta bug with a tophat and monocle
and the fact that they looked like scary dead women?
Hey!
Wind Waker had re-deads? I never got that far :(
What's up?
Lockon <3
Dusty: Cieling
HoodyNinja: Well lucky you. I was pretty much scared of anything zombie related at the time.. and They did :P
6_9 true
i mean it did
HoodyNinja, eeyup. They're pretty late in the game, but they're there.
Alright.
What's down?
;_;7
00,10that is a silly salute
HoodyNinja: Yep. And they scream at you and you become parylyzed.
Darn Triforce map hunting....
and that comic is genius
Then Sumica died ;_;7
DAT KICK.
hehehe
oni_link: That's the only thing I didn't really like about WInd Waker.
dari I love you XD
I am so not used to that salute either Sumica
... and after the rededs paralyze you, the WALL MASTERS grab you. Or your friend.
Yo, Wrek still online?
00,10oro?
Hello.
Dusty: He's sleeping.
00,10what did I do?
:O
Oh.
Okay.
i hate wasps
QUICK.
Slow.
Reflexonation: Hello?
Hi :D
NullRadix: To be honest, I never was scared of Wall masters. :D
oot redeads were scarier :/
i'm going to be going to bed soon...
AJIsAwesome|Homework: yeah me too. At first I was skeptical about the whole cel shaded thing but I had alotta fun with it and that was the only thing that I felt could have been changed. I loved the parry system
AJIsAwesome|Homework: WALLMASTERS ARE THE STUFF OF NIGHTMARES!
HoodyNinja: Not to me. I just found them annoying. :D
AJIsAwesome|Homework: they aren't that bad in the newer games... in the classic game they appeared like... at the VERY END of the dungeons
I feel so new here...
00,10likelikes are worse
and there aren't "shortcuts" to get back to the end
Reflexonation: Are you?
00,10they eat your shit
oni_link: DEFINITELY the parry system. Best system in years and I still love it.
I'm highly new here.
/me enjoyed the fighting system in TP
0,14Wind Waker's ReDeads are the worst
HoodyNinja: WallMasters were nothing to me!! But the Shadow Temple... thats a different story
Dusty told me about this all.
XDDD
I'm Max, by the way.
They are not welcome to consuming my fecal matter :<
Reflexonation: Welcome to random, have you read the rules yet?
whenever i hear Louise in that voice it reminds me of Zero no Tasukamai
SaxyPretender: They scream at you. Creepy. :S
0,14Yep
Have you ever been stung?
No, I haven't.
00,10meanwhile in the nation of silly hats
no, and i dont want to
I liek hats.
HoodyNinja: essentially that was a newer version of Wind Waker's parry system. I loved all the hidden techniques! Helm Splitter and Mortal Draw forever!!! And also that badass sword spin Link did when he sheathed his sword after you defeated an enemy :3
I like hats...
i have this red one
its pretty fantastic
Reflexonation: Welcome! :)
each time they say Gundam take a shot
oni_link: I don't like Skyward sword because of the running system and fighting is a pain, the first boss took me 2 hours
AJIsAwesome|Homework: I hope they bring back the parry system or Twilight Princess' combat system :)
Reflexonation: As long as you read the rules, you'll be fine here. :)
Thanks. :) so can anyone give me a little intro-guide-thing?
gold: nope. just a red hat
oni_link: Definitely.
Reflexonation: http://www.bronystate.net/rules/
Reflexonation: The rules will basically tell you everything. :)
HoodyNinja: Yeah it takes some getting used to. I agree that the sprint system was a bit intrusive, we could have done without it.
i have i black hat ( anyone who played pokemon GSC HG/SS should know that tho 6_9 )
Rules seem pretty self-explainitory.
Oh Lockon poor babby ;__;
a*
HoodyNinja: I liked the fighting system, but not the running system. THat kind of annoyed me.
I hate how they're trying to emphasize on the whole motion controlling gimic on the newer wii games, it was fun at first, but now they took it too far
I hated Ghiriam (not sure I spelled his name right) , I could't hit him for at least what seemed like 5 minutes
Kandarihu: yup
oni_link: I had the EXACT SAME problem.
03 Watching a movie called unleashed, see you all afterwards

I hope the pilots are okay.
So does anyone else get Zaku/Leo vibes from those green MS'?
HoodyNinja: he's IN IT
It fucking hurts
So anyone want to give me a rundown of what goes on here?
NO SHIT!
HoodyNinja: the trailers SHOW HIM kcking asse

oldie art
OF COURSE!
AJIsAwesome|Homework: Elmo
Reminds me of The-O
dat head
plus he's a biggun
AJIsAwesome|Homework: That first battle was soo annoying! After that though, the game felt too easy combat wise. But then again, ALL Zelda games get easy when you get the controls down :/ I wish they would focus on making the battles harder and that they went back to the darker tones that OOT, MM and even Twilight Princess had. Skyward Sword's bosses looked like something out of a Yo-Gabba Gabba episode... IMO
lol
HoodyNinja: :D

Thats why sometime I don't say hi to people, I dont like being ignored

Thanks, guys. :D
I always pronounced it zero zero
No
Reflexonation: We may get into debates sometimes, but they're pretty short so don't worry about it. :D
Welp, now that I know what it's called I...feel exactly the same about it. :I
oh the debates :D
lol fuck you :P
Reflexonation: No problem. Anytime. :)
00,10they are making a diffrence
I like debates, lol. I've actually joined the speech and debate team recently.
Gundam ooooo
where there is peace - there is more war
Meanwhile: like usual huh?
And just a question, how do I reply to you guys directly like that?
Reflexonation: just tab complete
otakon: Mhmm.
first couple letters, than tab
00,10type part of the name Reflexonation
00,10then hit tab to auto compeate
Thats cool Reflexonation , with all that practice you can get your points across rationally :D
Reflexonation: start typing the nick you want to ping...adn what Sumica said
flutter_spin: No, the war is usually somewhere else, thats why its so peaceful :3
otakon: Like so?
Reflexonation: aslo you can register your nick
Reflexonation: eeyup
woot woot Ponymon updated :$
unless war IS peace
Reflexonation: How did you first hear about this place?
i lost the game
Alright. Cool :D
Reflexonation: also watch out for the kickbots
Reflexonation: Use this place as practice
I learnded about bronystate through the you of tubes
AJIsAwesome|Homework: Dusty told me about it just today.
Reflexonation: And above all, follow the rules.
Reflexonation: Okay.
HoodyNinja: I saw myself in one of the vids :D
AJIsAwesome|Homework: He was saying it's pretty cool.
Derpy Wombo Combo video. That's how I learned.
Kencolt: Don't worry, I will. :)
Reflexonation, half of the mods here have kickbots who will kick if you send 6 lines within 10 seconds. otakon trips that all the time.
I learned about Bronystate through Ballad of the Brony.

HoodyNinja: never watch fight club?

Sumica: russian female engi?
sounds different than the last time I heard it
otakon it took FORRRRRRREEEEEEEVER, believe me

Masamune Shirow draws a overaccentuated female at times

but he weaves a fairly good story
Goodnight everypony :)

OH I'm not complaining
HoodyNinja: you're*

I like the old Shirow anime
I love this ep
Like Dominion Tank Police
Ah, more about the Laughing Man
Meanwhile: Ah, good to see you again
I LOVE Dominion Tank Police
?
his voice :D
Reflexonation: You have to see Wrek draw. He's an AMAZING artist. :)
did I hear Tai?
Welcome to the future of IRC
I HEAR TAI!
Dat visual forum room
TAI AND ICHIGO
AJIsAwesome|Homework: What does he draw?
00,10I wish my loging in was that cool
Kandarihu: I call red haired chick
dat lightning
oh yeah it's TOTALLY not The Major
dat face
Reflexonation: Mostly pony art. He recently drew an admiral Applejack.
Kandarihu: one day....
LOL ANIME IN ENGRISH xD
otakon: First time I watched this, I didn't THINK it was the major. I got caught up in the episode.
AJIsAwesome|Homework: That's pretty cool, got a link?
this anime is good in english
Reflexonation: He may draw some art that may be more mature, but he doesn't do it that often.
troll battles?
Reflexonation: watch out though, he has a saucy section too
OBJECTIOn
They're talking through text
what they're saying appears in front of them
AJIsAwesome|Homework: That's alright, I raised myself on the internet. I've seen mature content.
this is a visual reprentation of a chat room
00,10that is other people in the room
it's basically HERE
Lurkers
otakon: IT WORKS SO WELL!
0,14he's a maaaaaan
They're afk
those are the pony# in the room :P
00,10the text you see is the people sitting in the background adding in
eeyup
ponies, ponies everywhere
I think Im going to redo my OC, his hair and eyes dont resemble me at all :/ Im like a mexican Pinkie pie essentially
Chatrooms like that would be so weird...
Sumica: so those at the table are ops?
Meanwhile: are you kidding? this is great!
00,10kinda
Oh, you're right.
00,10it's more like the active talkers
ah
this kira is a fake!
SaxyPretender: sure ot it
ponies, too many ponies
otakon: I agree totally
0,14yesss
SaxyPretender: and Tai AND IChigo's VA's
AJIsAwesome|Homework: Wow, those are pretty damn good.
otakon: They mentioned no one else would come down the table earlier, presumably the people there are like, their regulars, and the background are metaphorically the lurkers.
Meanwhile: aha
"cool"
So that old guy is Kencolt?
What anime is this, guys?
I asked Mike if he wanted to "Cure my chestpain" and he said no so I'm all like "So you want me to be in pain? YOU'RE SO MEAN TO MEEEE!" I wonder if he'll think I'm really that hurt by it .w.
no offense Kencolt
00,10lol
ALL THIS INFORMATION
"Ghost in the Shell"
THIS ANIME IS THE HYPEST SHIT!
Ghost in the shell Stand alone Complex
This episode was very good at summing up all the episodes
Reflexonation: Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex
Because... He'd probably... be right
I guess it's hard to imagine IRC changing in the future. IRC's been pretty much the same for decades, even after this series.
needs 4Kids Dub :D
00,10dat sause joke
Apple :P
I DON'T EVERN KNOW ANYMOIRE QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM!
Driiiiiiiift.
I would LOVE to have the option to have a chat like this, but not be confined to using only this chat. I would like a text based thing kinda like we have now too.
lol
Kandarihu: well this is more of a visual reprentation, this doesn't actually look like that in their world. Think of the animation in a characters brain to represent the abstract process of thought in other cartoons.
Okay.
00,10just think of all the pony avatars you would see if this chat was like this
like Reboot, otakon :P
:)
flutter_spin: maybe
yeah they should have pony heads
Sumica: You cannot unsee this scene with the mane 6.
I would actually be a Fierce Deity avatar :D
00,10then again i would problably need a fire hose to stop the ERP
This is why I don't like this anime. Too much talking. I know, call me childish.
Sumica: lol
Sumica: or a Tachikoma
maybe he just thinks ur screwing around. i would tell him that ur not bullshitting and you actually need his help

moral... sex position?
otakon, I think it's more of a centralized room. Maybe one where people with paid premium accounts get their own avatars and voicechat, whereas freeloaders only get to send text.
the truth.
hmm
I dunno... I mean, that would be pretty fucked up if he thought I was joking when I said I stop breathing every so oftern....

Yea, this has happened to me several times before and the person I liked the most at the time was the only one who could help me and since right now the person I like most is Mike, gotta ask him
Reflexonation: If you're wondering how the italicized text is made, type "/me" before you type anything else. That's called RPing.
woohoo!!! I made it one year as an admin with most of my sanity intact!
Or just one example of RP.

MakerDusk: Don't let Celestia find out
Should I give myself a proper introduction?
:O
Whenever he says no, I just say "Well, I guess I'll have to wait till it just goes away on it's own" I've had this for months once when my mic broke. It never went away on it's own. I had to get a new mic
Reflexonation: Sure if you want to. :)
not celestia!
Reflexonation: No thats fine
Don't worry Sumica. We all know you like having a female OC
HoodyNinja: Alright then.

Digimon
Kandarihu: Digimon
00,10same voice as the admin guy from the chat ep
I've been reading the Dragon Ball manga lately. I must say, I really like the light-heartedness of the early parts :D
Ooh! Right. I saw that dub.

Hey Moopy

Moopy: Hello! :)

ingwaz: I used to.
TAI!
AJIsAwesome|Homework: how'd you fix it?
DAT EERIE music.
hmp dem computer stuff
ingwaz: Try clearing your cache.
i don't think that one is Tai...
hello

i've heard "the chief's" voice too...who is it?
hello moonstruck
MoonStruck: Hello! :)
Oh my
NocturnalBlade - give me a sec, i remember the voice too
hi MoonStruck
it was whoever voiced Tom from Toonami and whoever the villain was from Korra
where bluud?
forget that guy's name
boobies
yea, i think so
MirrorImage: yea, it does sound like Tom
hmmm... maybe not, unless the wiki is incomplete
o3o
this is Ghost in the Shell, yes?
o3o
:D
no your right
dat face
MoonStruck: you're*
Laughing Man again
Oh hey rainbowDash90
he done got haxed.
SMILY
And Togusa isn't even really a cyborg.
Is the SuperBrony64 in here?
00,10yes the kid in the wheelchair was the laughing man
although im certain that one kid voiced Tai from digimon though
Pinkies4thWall: hes not talking, so i'd guess not
hey whats up pinkies4thwall
what did it say? I missed it.
Sketch_Toku_Brony - he did
Then again, he pretty much is, just the least cyberized.
that was the same voice
Sketch_Toku_Brony: yea same here
no bus where I live
/me hugs Sumica and brushes his mane
that was definitely the same guy
yeah i was right :$ yay~
iirc Togusa just has implants
Togusa is a light-case cyborg-- mostly human-body with implants.
You don't get a bus?
Where do you live? a swamp?
pretty close to one actually
00,10only thing tougusa has is a cyberbrain
right down the street
Duke: always bet on duke
well
00,10but most every one has those
I wouldnt say that
I would say things like a .. cyberjack
just south of a national forest
Oh nuts :D
._.
Well...
An oldie but goodie.
oh god the naughty song
Kencolt: oh buck yea ^_^ love this
0,14man, this takes me back
such a fitting song for Rarity
lol totally
is this by Breatny spears stuff?
Moopy - think so
of course
0,14nope
BREAKING THE FOURTH WALL
SaxyPretender - it isn't?
Moopy: dont think so
0,14I forgot the artist, but it's not Britney
so thats who to blame great
night everypony
nite LunarRepublicGuard
Tara Young?
Night LunarRepublicGuard
what breatny spears has the oldest songs ever man
bey
Night LunarRepublicGuard, but aren't a night guard?
correction, "Tata" Young
Tata Young
More Guild Wars kirz? I've got a bit of a jump on you atm.
True. Yeah, and it's only because of his cyberbrain that he was hacked like that.
I remember when Britney Spears' songs were new.
based on the fact that this PMV came up in my google search, i would guess that i was right >_>
:P
song is called "SExy NAughty Bitchy Me"
CrazyCherry: its the same irony like when i go to bed, eventhough im Nocturnal
so i google that...
Heck, I remember when S Club SEVEN's songs were new :3
R1: Youtube of the original with Lyrics. R2: the music video. R3: this.
MirrorImage: i did that too lol small world
wow
NocturnalBlade: Okie.
oh god here we go
LOL!
Wut? A G1 PMV?
MEGAN BACON!
:D
This is neat
0,14>Do you believe in magic?
0,14OH GOD
0,14RUN
0,14RUN FROM THE FIRES
I'm also waiting to see if derper tries to log in as me again
Prefect timing for Sumica dance!
00,10heheh
Prefect!
they make me sick really bad it makes me want to throw up now
0,14zuh?
wait...there were DISCO LIGHTS underwater,wouldnt that electrocute the sea ponies...? :(
I'm rather impressed really. It's even a song from the same period!
*Moopy starts hurling up*
00,10g1 pilot was't that bad
Yay G1 song!
wait...why are we watching classic mlp?
imjustaderper tried to impersonate me last night
alright, WHO ASKED FOR PONIES!?
becuse its great
ingwaz: because without this no G4
Sketch_Toku_Brony, they might be designed like pool lights.
Megan looks a like Roll to me from the Mega Man cartoon. XD
ingwaz: Those who do not remember history are doomed to repeat it.
g1 ponies weren't bad.
Kandarihu oh that works :$
00,10if it was't for g1 then g4 would be g3 and well g3 sucks out outloud
Yeah. They weren't bad, just not as good as G4.
Growing up I loved this, also yay I got a Pony epsiode!
thank god its gone
Kencolt: i think we're okay on that one considering we now have FiM instead of more classic mlp
Also Hey everypony
Hey DerpStar!
0_o lol
hi DerpStar
such a palet clenser
http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc7/402837_133714043441227_1779709766_n.jpg
0,14well, that's douchey
Crazy song.
Hey .MOV Spike. Only time you'll see a piece of .MOV animation on this stream
Egad
also, i do agree Sumica that we should be grateful in a senese that mlp g1-3.5 existed, as theyre part of the history. just that i dont enjoy watching them for pleasure
Sumica, except that G3 would be as good as what G4 is, and we'd all be whining about G2
Boberaaaaaaan~
ingwaz: I was referring to what G5 could be if we forgot previous lessons.
Rain - BAD. No politics
yep
not politics. just a fact ^_^
so if you see "me" when I should be at work, feel free to report him
hey sumica that sea ponies stuff they make me sick to my stomach man i can't stand to look at it
barbera anne :)
great now this music has imagining Grease ponies singing Buck Lightning lol
Kencolt: indeed possible, but rememberance does not mean i need to enjoy it
00,10shame
Rain, I never heard Romney using that slogan.
Moopy why do you watch it then?
im not joking dude
ingwaz: THAT'S THE BUCKING POINT.
0,14no problem
Oh my
Does anypony know when S3 ep 1 will be airing?
I am not joking either. Why watch it if it makes you ill?
video length 22:04... i smell an episode
eeyep
no DerpStar, its not announced yet
Well, what do you have here?
Ah
BGM time?
inb4 grandpa
Oh yes
oh buck, just background
DerpStar: most likely some time very late september to mid-late october
feh
Well this is interesting.
DerpStar: or possibly even later in the year really
kinda reminds of Fantasia
ummmm ok what happen to the voices?
Okie Dokie Loki
00,10what do you meen /just/ back ground
....why is it silent...
Nice twansition Sumica!
Moopy: BGM version
its BG
This episode makes me feel sad. I mean, the lack of education apparent in most ponies...
ingwaz - this is the no-voice edit
Sandy Duncan did great voice work for G1. Does anyone else think so?
hmmm
Moopy, this is a Vocal Free edit, designed to draw attention to the OST
but....i like the voices MirrorImage
i see
This episode has some fantastic BGM
The ambienance is louder than the talking.
oh pinkie, i love you even when i cant hear you
Er ambiance.
hang on a minute my cat is scratching on my door
i prefer Gordan Freeman
This is the episode with the vocals stripped away.
ok this really reminding me of Sorcerer's Apprentice :D
you know...this does draw to my attention just how much work the BGM people put in to this show
Well, the MAIN vocals
i read mine in the voice of Gordan Freeman
ingwaz: IKR?
yay theme !
Wait
Well, the music is very incidental though. At least it's not constantly loud like how some studios do it.
DerpStar - "no-voice edit"
ALL the voices
AJIsAwesome|Homework: shall have to thank steffan andrews more often
Sumica: another Voice free ep?
FRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
he does do the BGM i believe right?
I heard Pony I know I did!
ok hes not there anymore
or is that william anderson?
00,10yes
WHAAAAA
Kandarihu: And that is why I love the music in this series.
Btw, sumica, HUG
so how far in guild wars are you kirz|GW2 ?
I dunno
/me hugs Pinkies4thWall
Sumica: was that yes directed towards me?
Sumica: Is this video still on youtube?
you know Sumica, I was just thinking to myself the other day, we ~really~ don't see Lesson Zero enough >.>
MLP without voices is like a BLT without the bacon :)
about level 40
00,10yeah all of s1 and most of s2
LT
out of 80
sumi wassup?
Sumica: Okay, thanks. :)
Ryunosuke: So a pony approved Sandwich?
Ryunosuke: crisp and delicious? just not as delicious as with bacon?
Background noises are still present :3
inb4 Derpy. :)
it .. .isnt bad, it is just missing a key ingredient :)
look derpy!
Chritopher Walken guest voicing for MLP would be epic.
0,14I'd be okay with that
Kinixys - ehh... i'd prefer either Patrick Stewart or Morgan Freeman
Polydunami: Well they can't get everything.
Derpy's a paper bag wizard! :( now she's a paper SAD wizard
the kind of people who you'd get your money's worth out of by giving them a speech JUST so you can hear them speak more
so help me Celestia......if you preent me from hearing my sweet Princess Luna's voice, i will find you, and i will kill you Sumica
A vegetarian dish is only vegetarian to those who can eat meat but chooses not to. The same dish to an herbivore is merely edible.
MirrorImage: We already have the best voice from Star Trek, we need to divesify
Patrucj Stewart as Starswirl The Bearded
i'll bet 1 of you guys have a rainbow wig
what ingwaz said, it isnt bad, it would just be more delicious with the bacon
MirrorImage: I'm okay with them, too!
00,10deal with it
those are good choices, but BRIAN BLESSED is needed
Patrick
Aww, I can't hear Zecora's sexy voice :(
I really love this music coming up.
Pic related: http://derpy.me/dUHXo
00,10we watch the eps normaly all the time
DerpStar - yes... but consider the possibilities...
its not a bad change
Patrick Stewart Zebra...
thats what killing you is helping me do, deal with it.....
its kind of like story time...
you just KNOW he'd ham it up
THUNDER MADE MY STREAM GO BUFFER!
lol why wasnt there a Simon Belmont pony?! :D
also, scootawolf is awesome
ha ha
MirrorImage: that would mean creating more "Q" episodes just to hear Stewart
and sweeticula
so you were saying you will take it slow and enjoy the game
it made you buffer
00,10the crickets sound like the larva from hl2
Yes, this is certainly one suggestion that I'd like to see happen. A Starswirl the Bearded flashback voiced by Patrick Stewart... or BRIAN BLESSED!
And since they are limiting the series to 13 episodes a season I'm not willing to make that trade off
0,14well, I'm off to bed
00,10night SaxyPretender
0,14good night everyone and enjoy the stream
Good night, SaxyPretender!
yeah
inb4 sonic x theme
MirrorImage: Oh but thats what would make it awesometacular
SaxyPretender: Night! :)
I am enjoying it :P
Night SaxyPretender
Luna has the worst timings.
nite SaxyPretender
SaxyPretender: G'night.
and Meanwhile is 60, so this is taking it slow
I am taking it slow.
LUNA!!!!
Don't know if I should sleep or watch stream.
I'm just naturally faster than average.
Well, Royal Canterlot Voice I expect to shine through.
Yep
lol dat JAWS pony
I really like this BGM only video.
First time we see the "recovered" Luna, BTW.
also, I just love when I hit an evade ability, and jump backwards right off a cliff into a group of more mobs >.<
time to kill Sumica........
00,10there is no muteing the royal canterlock
lol you can still hear Luna :D
her thuum is too powerful for the mute!
Royal Canterlot Voice defeats muted voice
Luna will love SimGretina's remix of her.
Disengages young legacy of landing in lava continues...
that takes us to the lesson.. don't jump backwards of a cliff
Sumica: she does not neeeeed. A microphone...
/me forgives Sumica for the mute
I can BARELY hear Luna
none can quiet the ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE!
Why is no-pony respecting her authoriteh?
Well, Royal Canterlot Voice has been defeated.
Her voice is buckin' POWERFULL!! AHHH! :[ :D
twilight sparkle uses lecture!
its super effective!
the cliff isn't always there when you start the fight
ninja cliffs
Tis Tradition!
Oh, I see.
Cliffs need railings.
:o i can still hear the voices...just barely
TWILIGHT SPARKLE uses LECTURE.
Target falls asleep.
Polydunami: i would never fall asleep during a twilight lecture :O
Fluttershy uses Stare. Target is now paralyzed.
Polydunami: id stay awake through one of her lectures, if you know what i mean ;)
Well. Time to execute my cunning plan!
Me neither :D
Barbetos: How cunning?
COME!
I am going to sleep.
Did I hear real horse sounds in the background?
bye Barbetos
*splat*
Kinixys: neigh
Barbetos: Night! :)
And I will tell you in tah mornin
bey
How is...*mute*
Perfect!
How bout noooo
3' o clock in da mawnin!
Cya Barbetos
THESE DAYS, THE ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE CAN BE GATHERED VIA CAPS LOCK KEY.
I like the aoe the longbow gives me, but I think the shortbows are better for raw damage output
Hey Dinky!
oh pinkie, you make me smile
00,10yes but we call it Canterlock
observe your Life Size Fluttershy Action Figure
lol
dat music
Aww, no record scratch? Lame :|
:3
All bow before 3rd most powerful pony: Twilight Sparkle
I hit things until they stop moving.
its [kiwi]sack!
lol :P
Sometimes after they've stopped moving.
man seeing this makes me wanna see a Fantasia style episode in S3
i wonder if the fiw people were serious about dole complaining
00,10FiW> serious>wut
dat success score
*le shrug*
I love it that even the fact that even though Luna has been around for a long time, she has no idea what fun is. :D
Lol Sweetie Vamp
I feel like an idiot
I just discovered that 0^0 is 1
Wow, I messed up my last sentence pretty bad.
dat psychotic grin
*badly*
00,10ponies did't have fun in lunas day. if you go by the video they just work and sleep
AJIsAwesome|Homework: The Moon = Where Fun Goes to Die
DOH! :|
Prince_Blueblood: it is?
twilight_sprinkle, I really don't think they were serious about it.
yes
00,10god that luna face
Popout stream, close it. NO MORE STREAM FOR ME!
AJIsAwesome|Homework: the word fum did not existed a thousand years or so ago
EVERYTHING to the power of zero is one, Prince_Blueblood :S
*fun
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY POINTS!
Kandarihu: it surprised me that they continued the thing in the next ep
I was doing some pattern analysis and discovered that's the only solution that would cause the math rules to be consistent
google agrees
Sumica: that or shes just putting on an act in order to go from her previously feared appearance of nightmare moon to someone who is likable by all the ponies
Spectrum_Rush: I know, I'm just joking. :D
Sumica: i think the 2nd sounds more likely
Polydunami, yes, that's true, but still it's a bit surprising
Even INFINITY to the power of zero is one :O
and so Big Mac was BITTEN by luna's spider and became the dumbest super hero,HORSE SPIDER MAN
"Skritt Thief Rikkih", "Skritt Thief Tikkih"
Rikkih Tikkih...

Germany?
00,10yeah
00,10it was posted like a week before the ep
ROFL
twilight_sprinkle: there is an explanation that basically says 0^0=1 because mathematicians said so , period
im too sleepy to read the whole article, but on one site it says that y^x=1*y*y*y...y x times, so if x is 0 then its just 1
Sumica, by Hasbro?

if i remember the name correctly..
twilight_sprinkle - ehh... Confusion, Psychic, Hypnosis
they all looked the sa-STORIES
swag sweater
Riot just lost some of the little respect i had for it
This video game has the worst controls, I can't even control the blue pony anywhere I want it to go. :|

Gonna go play some UNDEAD NIGHTMARE.
MASF123: whats that
heh
dumbasses
Look it up on Google, twilight_sprinkle, I'm sure you'll get results.
MASF123: What game has bad controls with a blue pony?
MASF123: how to google?
hi MASF123
I'm pretty sure the song is called RIDE of the Valkyries :S
and then RD was eaten. The end
Late hello, BS.
hai Ninjazz
Oh dear.
Bronystate says hello, Ninjazz ;)
That's just sad.
Yay.
dead bronystate that is
That's just... unsporting.
127 days
Polydunami: its flight of the valkyries i just checked
and then turtle left and RD died
That's like 4 evers.... :(
how to kill your game, step 1: tell the gamers they can only play your game
yep and they are trying to grow eSports at the same time
hi Ninjazz
That scene of Dashy riding Tank is great.
Little guy. Almost the same size as Spike. Seems legit.
!mail GilDash Well, hop on when you're awake and not working and see if I'm on. If not, I've done the math wrong.
and doing it by putting restrictions to it ... makes senes right ?
Lol.

twilight_sprinkle, lol. Good to know. >.<
Looking it up for myself, I find that the popular name is Ride of the Valkyries :$
Ride of the Valkyries is the name most people know it by
if that isn't the actual name
(\/)(;,,;)(\/)
Polydunami: Wilhelm Richard Wagner-Flight of the Valkyries
oh damn it
Walkürenritt or Ritt der Walküren
dat magicpunk
japaaaaaaaaaaan
Die Walküre is the opera it's from
Silver: so is it flight?
and Tank died in terrible flying accident and was never seen in the show agian
shoo be doo
oi sea ponies, do my homework
twilight_sprinkle: more or less, yeah
thanks Sumica
Thanks for the GitS and BGM eps
tnx for stream Sumica
thanks Sumica
00,10Night all
Ritt seems to translate as "ride" for me
Sumica: Thanks for all the great stream.
thanks Sumica
bye Sumica
o/ Sumica
bey Sumica
sleep well Sumi
I'm starting to like Sumica over SuperBrony64
I like 'em all
Gnight, Sumi.
Both are great
Sleep well.
Good night, Sumica!
Sumica > SuperBrony64
except for that Silver_Spoon, what a bitch :P
Fuck, I choked on water
http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc7/303586_426540424078702_1659472944_n.jpg
i love all the streamers
SB is awesome too
thanks sumica for the stream bro
But there are things known as favorites
rain: lolol
he had the guts to stream something..
lol Rain
What's a brain, Rain?
:3
:p
Polydunami: I think it's a kind of food?
Brain...is that like some raisen cereal or something?
dats rasin brain
No, it's definitely some kind of precipitation.
Hey spike who do you like better rarity or twilight?
That picture should be the stream loading screen.
helms have been used for many centuries tho..
But in hockey...
Hockey in armor. Make it happen.
11,02Umm...why are you trying to compare me with Sumica?
SuperBrony64: because you have two similar first letters!
Polydunami: the stick ain't supposed to go over the waist:P
/me glomps SuperBrony64
that was funny you guys were playing go fish yesterday
/me hugs Jmo back
Becuase people like playing favorites, SB. :<
I don't get it :S
Ninjazz: and sucking up
11,02Well, I mean, I wasn't even talking in this chat and somehow two people mentioned Sumica being better than specifically me. Not sure why that was...
aaaaaand all my money is gone to unlock the next tier of skills >.<
SuperBrony64: ah nothing, it was random
we love you SuperBrony64
^
dont worry about that, SuperBrony64. people are just being dicks
^
yeah i'd do to dude
And don't know how to speak politely and be courteous to people who don't even need to work for them.
Personally, I like Chocolate and vanilla flavoured ice cream equally :3
00,10so many pings and wth guys that's not nice
11,02I like you all too, but just seemed a bit out of the ordinary. I don't mind if people dislike me, just if people have solid reasons for it.
But still do.
SuperBrony64: who in their right mind could dislike you :O
I never said Sumica was better than you. I don't dislike you at all SB64.
no seriously,
I'll leave you tonight if your bothered by it.
/me hugs SuperBrony64 and gives him a filly Pinkie Pie
Sumica <> SuperBrony64
SuperBrony64: it was just totally random, dont worry about it
Well not really jumping in on it but like I said I like both you guys
My understanding was it was a like -more- but not a dislike. Like liking chocolate more than vanilla, but loving Ice cream in general
*you're :P
vanilla is best flavor
for ice cream
You're a little too late with the ice cream analogy, Silver_Spoon :3
Hell yeah vanilla
Polydunami: I was feeding off what you said :x
>_>
Oh -_(\ me again
note the emoticon
Oh -_(\ me again
Favorite ice cream flavors: GO
Pistachio!
Bubblegum flavour.
garbage flavor
fudge swirl
the 4th flavor
I want to try durian.
Rain: legendary
twilight_sprinkle: I prefer Edy's Pumpkin. Now THAT's best ice cream for me
I get chocolate -and- vanilla :)
Silver_Spoon: yes, same here
Cookies n cream
glad someone picked up on that ref, Petrified_Discord :3
Rain: :)
Rain: Kids next door for the win /)
(\
Too bad you can't get it year round...
JESmith71: never heard of it tbh
JESmith71: is it a halloween thing?
Sounds like a thanksgiving thing to me.
twilight_sprinkle: It's a limied flavor they only sell it around Octover and November
October
/me is gettin' sleepy
JESmith71: then the season is almost neigh, i should be on the lookout
I'd say the strangest flavor I've ever had was cinnamon. It's odd to have a cinnamon flavored treat that isn't hot, but cold. :/
goodnight everypony
nite Silver_Spoon
*snrk* eheh... more of SimGretina's randomness made the front page it seems
bye Silver_Spoon
lol, went from yellow to gray from just making iron ingots
why am i not asleep, i have physics in less than 6 hours...
twilight_sprinkle: Because you are a true hero
Petrified_Discord: more like a true idiot <.<
Tell me about it.
Because sleep is never important.
I powered through iron so easy but didn't think to leave some of it as ore instead of bars, could've gone into steel.
twilight_sprinkle: No way! Like, this level of heroic: http://derpy.me/pt6Mt
And don't let anyone ever tell you otherwise.
...
Petrified_Discord: the drowning guy?:D
Oh right.
You didn't know that.
YES
:D
Ninjazz: ok, that doctor almost had me convinced, but i believe you
You need iron ore for steel bars.
It's /always/ a good idea to believe me. :)
tim for midnight snacks!
Well, being a hero and an idiot seem to go hand in hand most of the time :D

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=94128543
here you guys go
Thanks ill vote
Im so excited
Is it actually going to release soon
yes, on next thursday or so
Voted
IT's RELEASING!!?!?!?
WOAAAAAH
Hat, Soon... in "Valve time"...
here is the count down: http://www.blackmesasource.com/
Yes, they have a countdown on their website and everything. =D
WOOOOO
Yes... 9 "Valve" days.
lol, they redid the sound track and everything!
lol jk's, it's releasing
and vavle isnt working on it either!
Yes, Wrek. It's HL1 remade with HL2's graphics
Remake with new graphics I think
Black mesa is a redo of the original by some mod group, and it has been in development for a very long time
It's a fan project
Can't be Half Life without long wait times
Ahh, friend told me it was a valve project due back in 2007 or 9 or something, he's a liar nao >:(
There is Half Life Source that was by Valve
Yeah, That'll be awesome. =D
I've already played through HL2 twice (all three episodes of it), so it'll be quick when I get there.
half life source was really just an updated pshysics engine and nothing else

Ponies47: i get there at 7:50 or so and leave at 3 or so
PsychoticDoc: Nice

:S
Gold_Demona: why are you up so early? :O
Howsit feel to be 12 hours behind Gold_Demona :>
MadSurge: school?
it has 7 time zones if you cound hawaii and alaska
8:13PM~
its everywhere from 4-8 oclock form pasific to atlantic
MadSurge: Because my husband's work schedule has us waking up that early. :P
brb
Really I'm up at 4am every day. I pop into Bronystate after he leaves for work
4AM? That's murder.
Gold_Demona: and you help him up? :) You're a great wife
i sleep at 12 and get up at 4 or 5 and bronystate until 730 for school
I make him a big hearty breakfast and pack him lunch, and then when he comes home, I make his dinner. I keep my hubby well fed. :3
i wake up like 06 30 amv:P
On mondays we wake up at 3 cuz he's scheduled an hour earlier
Gold_Demona: dont you have a job?
Nope. I do not. I make up for it by doing all the house chores.
house chores... pfffft, i hate dishes and trash
I keep the place clean, make all the meals, do all the laundry, keep the kitchen clean, etc.
MASTAPLAYA69
Gold_Demona: thats too bad, im gonna get a job within the oil industry
Well, he takes out the trash, but I clean out our cats' litter boxes.
Back. Cats we're fighting again -_-
Gold_Demona: so boring, yet necessary eh?
i have a cat :)
PhychoticDoc: I hate dishes too, but they ain't gonna clean themselves. =/
dishwasher?
I love cleaning dishes, dunno why. ;~;
MadSurge: Yup, it's tedious work, but somebody's gotta do it. And since I'm the one who's home all the time it might as well be me, right?
Jmo: youre crazy in youre head
Loco in de coco
i hate toushing dirty dish water, makes my hands greasy
touching*
Gold_Demona: when you're not on Bronystate, why not?
MadSurge: Eeyup. That's usually where I go when I'm afk. Doing house chores.XD
Wrek: its take me down to the paradise city, where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Jmo: You like to clean dishes? Then my mom would love you! :D
Gold_Demona: Is your husband a brony too?
>.<
Gold_Demona: if you have little too do at home, go train! i do :)
MadSurge: He's a closet brony. He likes the show, but he doesn't show it openly to anybody other than other bronies. Which is fine, cuz I'm Brony enough for the both of us. XD
Gold_Demona: :D that's wonderful
mentallyeffedguy: Train? What do you mean? Train for what?
good afternoon fellas

*sticks?
Well, yeah DDR memory sticks.
Hello DerpDash

Wrek: is that game good? i saw it in the store for fuking 700kroner

"So after we coat them in choclate we put them on the DDR"
Wrek: only 300kroner?

Eli: how much does it cost too buy youre country then? :P
Wrek yeah take the S.T.A.L.K.E.R series they crash alot but damn are they good to ignore it really
I had that problem with Knights of the Old Republic on one of my previous PCs.
o.o
Wrek: do you have a youtube account?
mentallyeffedguy: :P apearently not that much it seems. just look at the news, we're getting bought by every damn govenement
mentallyeffedguy: at least our bank secrets
Eli: i dont wach swiss news, sorry :P
I never understood this game...
mentallyeffedguy: dude, that's international news...
Eli: i only watch the news about norway, TV2 and NRK1
I'm surised this game even sold. Being a stealth based game. Not saying I don't like them but for some reason nowadays unless your firing like a madman every 10 seconds it's "not fun".
TheRandomkid321: that's why i loved portal so much. firing like a madman
I love stealth games :)
And the twelve year olds called it gay.
TheRandomkid321: That is because all they play is CoD and they still think gay is an insult
TheRandomkid321: i think stealth games are my favourites
I like stealh games I was saying that all the tweleve year olds buying it saying "Ohmehgawsh it haz gunz it must be aw50m3!!!!" Disliked it.
Stealth games not fun, lol. Tell that to the people who made the Metal Gear Solid series. :P
Wrek gotta say your new way of playing while talking is alot more amusing :)
Sounds like a teacher.
/me forgot to scroll down.
how can wrek read what we are saying when he is still playing the game? does he have like 2 screens?
He can only stream a game if it's in windowed mode
So yes he can read the chat
Oh and Wrek, thanks for banning me yesterday I honestly was being a total buckwit and I deserved it.
TheRandomkid321: why did you push it on yourself? not excacly nececcery
TheRandomkid321 what did you do?
mentallyeffedguy I thought I deserved to be punished formy irresponible behaviour.
http://i.imgur.com/Ssmct.jpg >.>
TheRandomkid321: oh well we are very different persons
:O
Mutterguy: awesome

I think they're going to be 20 mins long as usual...

if the bad guys ever learned to patrol the vents, jensen would be screwed
Let's just be grateful that there ARE a season 3... Well of course it was going to be a season 3, Judging on the popularity of the show

Troy: only 13 episodes? suicide will be commited after viewing them
But im guessing in september

Dragonmatte: i came home 2 hours ago
And it is for the streamer too
:3
Dragonmatte: where are yuou?
sweden
well im in Norge :)
det ar 1600 her og
Wrek: how long have you been playing now?
ALL NORWEGIANS SHOULD TALK NYNORSK! xD
xD
So awesome
Dragonmatte: i talk bergensk :P
Well i've got a norwegian friend on steam, i can never understand him when he talks norwegian xD
But i do understand nynorsk ;3
Dragonmatte: he probably talks østlandsk
Mhm
Dragonmatte: thats the worst kind of norsk
xD
Well i think i speak one of the easiest sorts of swedish
it doesnt sound norwegian at all
østlandsk that is
Norrländska
:3
Dragonmatte: kor er du i sverige?
Dragonmatte: did you understand that? :P
Yep
In the northern part :3
:| i'm just gonna pretend i understand everything :
Norrbotten
xD
Eli: we now you understand us perfectly :)
I love the sound for agreeing there, and i do mean sound
söll i afo schwizerdütsch z rede? ir wäred alli gfiggt :P
It's not a word xD
Schhp or something like that xD
translation to the above: should i start talking swiss german? you'd all be fucked :P
not even germans understand me :(
swiss german reminds me of ROOOOOOGER FEDERERRRRRRRRRRR
fun fact: swiss german does not even have a past simple. and no defined grammar. you can write words just after how they sound :)
It's not allowed to link youtube vids, right?
Dragonmatte: you could ask Wrek for permission
Okai :3
twilight_sprinkle: you and your Roger Federer...
I guess that turret... Backfired
YEEEEEAAAAAH
Eli: HES THE BEST OF ALL TIME MJLGNIWOJNFMIWOENFMWIOFWOEFG
it sure sounds fantastc
twilight_sprinkle: i think so too, but you'ree more of a fan than most guys from here :P
Eli: most people here dont know much about tennis <.< but the most important thing to know is that Federer is da best! oh and hes playing today :3
hørt om svensken som aldri gikk ut med kona fordi han hadde hørt at det var galt å gå ut med gifte kvinner?
:3
twilight_sprinkle: i hate the people who said things like "I'm such a fan of Federer" and as soon as he wasn't number one any more, turned their backs on him. he's still the greatest
I love that in sweden, the one who is stupid is always the noregian, and im guessing that in norway, the swedes are the stupid ones? xD
yupp, apperantly we hate each other :P
xD
keep the chat english? whaaaaaat? for 100 kr
Eli: yeah, i believe theyre called 'glores', people who are only fans of the number 1. but hes back, and he showed em all again
And i've heard finland and denmark doesn't like sweden either xD
twilight_sprinkle: i know right? ;)
Eli: i really like his playing style as well, so graceful and nt boring defense
Dragonmatte: its only jokes though so thats good
UUUUUUUGH i need some more of my fix >.<
In Italy the dumb ones are the Carabinieri (ex-military police) :D
Japp chokolate >.<
twilight_sprinkle: and he still can keep it up for hours!
Dragonmatte: nammm
Japp is so awesome
fucking pie!
And amazing
Eli: and years. 31 and playing better than top playeres at their peak age
swedish pie :P
And other awesome words
i think this is the boss battle
Even better then malteasers, Imo
piegasm much? hehehehehe
You need to put away the pie, ITS TOO GOOD!
twilight_sprinkle: they should put Federer on the new swiss bills :)
Our Blueberry smulpaj is BETTER! >:D
>:3
Eli: who is federer?
Eli: on the 100 one too :D he alreadry has stamps which is awesome too
mentallyeffedguy: WHO IS FEDERER? WHO IS FEDERER?!?!?!? WHO SI FDERERR?????WHQIDJIQFJMQFQN
mentallyeffedguy: i hope you're trollin, but he's a swiss tennis player
I dont know either xD
mentallyeffedguy: A successful swiss tennis player
Is he number one again now?
twilight_sprinkle: yes that was my question
well i dont care much for tennis
Federer is widely considered to be the greatest tennis player of all time, and one of the greatest athletes who ever lived
Dragonmatte: if you hear tennis in the news, federer is usually the next word you hear
Aha
I dont care too much for tennis :3
But not knowing Federer, come on, I also really don’t care about tennis, but I know him
and imo he might be the greatest athlete ever, hes just all-around physically balanced. he could probably play any sport excellently
^the definition of fan
Eli: no but seriously, even the commentatoras say so
ive never heard of him until now
mentallyeffedguy: well remember the name!
twilight_sprinkle: i don't doupt Federer's greatness, i just find it funny
twilight_sprinkle: i already forgot :P
Hmm... What shall i play...
mentallyeffedguy: dont make me find you and grind it into your head >:I
Tf2, Guild wars 2, or something else >.<
guild wars 2 :D
Eli: hes an awesome guy too. wouldnt like him if he werent a nice person
Do you have it?
Afternoon, everybrony.
Hewwow :3
is their a rule here against talking anything but english?
twilight_sprinkle: he is. you know, celebs don't need bodyguards here in switzerland, i could probably meet him if i intended to. he lives close to my grandparents vacation house
Yep, i think so...
well thats stupid
how are you Malavolent
Nothing out of ordinary alexxm, how about you?
Eli: :O:O:O
mentallyeffedguy: you can still do it in privat chat
i'm good Malavolent
Eli: go give him a hug
Eli: itd be epic to get his autograph
Eli: i saw him in person up close on a tourny once, but couldnt get an autograph
twilight_sprinkle: that wouldn't be too hard i guess. if i ever run into him, i'll ask for one for you :)
Wham!
Eli: get his autograph, wait till he dies, ????, profitt!
Eli: yaaaaaaaaay ty ty ty :)
mentallyeffedguy: oi, dont talk about that! >: (
twilight_sprinkle: if i run into him... no guarantees
twilight_sprinkle: hey, im all about money
Eli: i understand, hes elusive :D
mentallyeffedguy: >: (
mentallyeffedguy, thanks, now I got nicki minaj on my brain
Jmo!
Vivix: hahahahaha!! didint think of that
hehehe
and le boss battle
twilight_sprinkle: oh, he lives in Bottmingen.. i thought Gstaad... well...
Eli: hm, i thought Basel
twilight_sprinkle: that means i live 10 km to his house :P
Bottmingen is in Basel.
well "she" was ugy
...rihanna?
Eli: woops :$
ugly*
who now?
never mind
:D
everytime I read your name Sylandest I hear Sylandshest- which makes me think "Southern horses? wut?"
Vivix: well, you're not far off. I am from the South, hehe :D
ooh hehe
i want pepsi max!
twilight_sprinkle: i could go to his house in, i guess around 1h and take a pic ;P but i guess since he's not there it wouldn't make much sense
Eli: yeah, you should stalk him in the bushes near his house and jump out and ask for an autograph :D
When I was a kid, me and my sister went to this footballer shouse and asked for autograph, and he went inside for like 15 minutes, and came out with a presign printed card
like not even--actually signed, just printed
we were so dissapointed-
Vivix: do you remember which footballer?
Roar Strand, norwegian gu y
ah k
He was pretty big in norway back then- but yeah
Vivix: Roger wouldn't do that. we don't do stuff like that here :P
dont think Roger has any presigned stuff tho
hehe
roooaaaaar straaaaaaaaaaaaaand!
I just got in so not sure who that is, but yeah
ROAAAHR
well guys im outa here, people think i use too much time on the computer so...'

Everlasting_Joy, I know that feel. (also, me rarely being in here now doesnt help.)

I guess we're too busy watching the stream. :P
Isn't it good? :) This way we can communicate easyer ^^

:D
caught me off guard.
hi SafariMonkey
Hi all
00,10hmmmmmwhy so lag
:(
Howdy SafariMonkey.
00,10lets see if this clears it up
Sumica - demolishing Big Ben?
yeah, that might clear up some interference
you'll get hell from the Cultural Department though
Hi Ravebrony and NocturnalBlade and Everlasting_Joy
GOOD MORNING BRONYSTATE!
Hey sonicandmario85!
dafuq are we watching
inb4GunShot
sonicandmario85: Dr. Who.
oh
does this episode have the weeping angels in it?
Nah
sonicandmario85: That's not for two more series (seasons)
00,1010 doctor had those
Evgeryone having problems with the streaming?
not anymore SafariMonkey
*everyone
not me
Not anymore
00,10refresh
00,10I had to kill it
This episode is actually pretty good.
OK will do... again. :P
my cats out like a light on my lap XD
:D I love the 9th Doctor's wit.
dat position my cats in while sleeping....
00,10like she needs a pasport
00,10so much lampshade
SEP field. :P
nowmy cats like: JUST TAKE ME RIGHT HERE
00,10damn welsh
XD
oh french
"But they were French!" :D
00,10so much death
SO MUCH DEDS
"He was decapitated" "Very... icy"
seems legit
"My goldfish, Goldy?" "Eaten by the cat."
"The cat?" "Choked on the goldfish."
for some reason i dont trust her -_-
NocturnalBlade - the mayor? for good reason
00,10ewwwwwwwww
ewwwwww
SHES AN ALIEN!
OH GOD
RUN
I think the main concern is, 'eww humans around'
shes an ugly alien DX
00,10she's got feels
i know right, why does she have to stand in front of the mirror?
00,109th is kinda rude
foreshadowing? Turn left?
Sumica:is this 9th?
yeah
00,10yeah
Sumica:are we gonna get to 10 soon? i wanna see the weeping angels so badly...
I like 9th. I have a soft spot for mildly grumpy guys. =P
00,10npe
wait...their "arms" are their phones?
sumica streaming doctor again?
00,10yeah Derpy_at_work
cool
sonicandmario85: We won't get to the weeping angels for a long time.
till the season ends?
sonicandmario85: Not until series (season) 3, this is series 1. Blink is (IIRC) episode 5 of series 3.
00,10jumpen jack
FAIL
Jack be nimble. Jack be quick.
sonicandmario85: There are about 20 episodes before we get to "Blink."
well it isnt too long
I love this part :).
Blink is s3e10
SafariMonkey: Thank you :).
SafariMonkey: the original s3 or the newer seasons?
00,10no I ment what have I done recently
00,10syrse 3 seasion 3
ingwaz: I thought s3 was easier than s29
on the newbs
safari, was not sure, havent seen much of doctor who personally, good show, just havent seen a lot of it
Bad Wolf.
00,10bad wolf
Dun dun duuuuunnnn
00,10mood swing
I love that about this show, there's this overarcing theme throughout the series.
ingwaz: Newb isn't an insult
SafariMonkey: didnt take it as one, just a simple statement.
00,10hah
Noob is an insult, but not newb
00,10"how did you get the outside around the inside"
I love these parts with the Doctor and her.
ingwaz: Nor was I saying you were. Direct answer: New series
Hello Sumica <3
nope, sorry, you were condemned for other reasons
00,10hi MadSurge
lol, weak guilt trips have little effect on me
00,10yeah no, she planed to blow up the planet
00,10she killed many already
Sumica: I hope SlurryMoon gets in today, I got him some presents :D
exactly sumica
that alone is a crime punishable by death
I love how she tries to say they are no better then her, despite the fact they are bringing the hammer of justice on her.
Everlasting_Joy: its easy to try and twist those who dispense justice on themselves
00,10yeah he will be on later
wait...i thought the companion was usually the doctors girl? or thave they not progressed that far
ingwaz: Right, right. I just find it funny on who is saying "are you better then me?"
00,10with the 9th, she already had a boyfriend
hey, just got here, what's happened so far?
Everlasting_Joy: easy tactic commonly used by villians. villians who kill others and are defeated by heroes who have to kill are easily able to point out that the hero is killing as well
00,10yeah this ep kinda lacks
a bit
ingwaz: Yep.
I love the resturant scene.
00,10it gives her 30 seconds of feels
00,10and we some how have to buy this whole guilt
:D
Sumica: she was going to destroy the planet simply to get off it. i feel pretty much no guilt at sending her back home where she has an execution order waiting for her
Sumica: Yet the Doctor and company still bring her home.
Should have a live TV Tropes list: every time you notice one, you add it to the list
:D
well...i would say the doctors a fool, but apparently not
00,10plans to blow up the planet twice.
lol
denied!
:D
Thrics denied XD
thrice*
oh doctor, you're quite well prepared
apparently she cant shut up about the doctor...shes a bad date bro
poor guy
00,10wonder how much time has passed for mickie
00,10Doctor is wise to her
It's moments like these that make me love 9th Doctor.
Neneneneneneneee
The lady she saved
finally I love this bit
Darn it! I won't be able to finish this episode. Oh well, I must depart. Farewell good folks!
the doctor's reaction
00,10mickey are you thick or some thing?
stupid, the doctors got a time machine thingy, of course i'd run to him
Thick is an understatement
oh look, torchwood HQ
....STREAM why you freeze at horrible times
ingwaz, is your Firefox freezing when the stream freezes?
It just went CRAYYYYZEEEE
Kandarihu|OldComp: I USE CHROME
-CAPS

Back into the womb-er, egg!
omlets anyone?
Who's streaming?
Pinkie123: Sumica
well, somebody is pissy
Doctor being.... the doctor.
Pinkie123: You can learn who's streaming by seeing which OC is on the screen :D
Second chance. LOL
...
wait...the doctor is on reality tv? SERIOUSLY?
THATS HILARIOUS
THIS BIG BROTHER I MUST SEEE
OSHIT THIS EPISODE
ingwaz: It's pretty good
DAAAAAAAAAAAAALEEEEEEEEEEEEEKS
ingwaz: You WILL change your mind.
Ruuun!
EXTERMINAAAAATE
Kencolt: looks hilarious to me
Kencolt: What?
I have seen every episode of the series-- except for the lost ones from Series One-- ever made.
RECAP
I know what of what I speak.
How many episodes is that Kencolt?
was that the shaun of the dead guy?
Sumica: why skip episode?
00,10huh?
00,10who skiped?
I'm not sure. First series, it was mostly 4 episode serials, except when it wasn't.. and everything here is 1 or 2 parters.
SafariMonkey: that was a previous episode recap
hello everypony :)
hi BronyInstrumental
Hello BronyInstrumental :)
Sumica: Sorry, thougt you'd do the previous one? first.
Hiyo BronyInstrumental
00,10what are you on about SafariMonkey?
00,10they are in order
lol reality show ?
Sumica: Sorry, I'll leave it.
just got back from school and oh? doctor who!
lol, the Ann-droid
Sumica: he thought the giant worm air conditioner episode was the one before this one
00,10it was before this but not directly
Sounds like they actually got Ann Robinson to do the voice. That's brilliant. XD
lol i use to watch that show
JACK
Dem fembots
00,10ohmy
He had to ask.
Naked Jack
that is the defabricator
Gold_Demona: nosebleeding yet? :D
Sumica: I know, i didn't realise it was in exact order
Sumica: THE SONIC DOESN'T DO WOOD!
that was weird...facebook told me someone in japan just accessed my account
anyone ever have that happen before?
ingwaz: I've had that happen once, but someone in India instead. I suggest you change your password.
did, just odd that they would get my password since i dont use predictable ones... shall have to do a system scan
00,10lol
What kinda freaky game show am i watching/
00,10torchwood
Weakest Link with robot Ann. That's funny
HEHEHEHE
President?

Even fembots are a legit target for Captain Jack
DED
Not so giggly anymore eh Rose?
oh god. big brother is still running D:
DED TOO
00,10sooooooooooooo, why would any one want to be on game shows?
They wouldn't. They get randomly chosen and yoinked into them. =/
Apparently, no-one DOES.
Just like the Doctor, Rose, and Jack did
We are Borg!
Gold_Demona: you win! You're not the Weakest Link! :)
Ponies
soo in the future they use wooden rackets again?..
OH MAI
As in off with your face. :D

Kencolt: and "blow it out your ass"?
twilight_sprinkle: Good one.
Ohai everypony. Ohai Doctor
Hello Petrified_Discord
hi Petrified_Discord
Hiyo Petrified_Discord
:)
For those who don't get the "pay for my licence" joke, in the UK, you actually have to pay a regular licence fee for your TV sets, and to recieve programming.
hi Petrified_Discord
Ohai Petrified_Discord!
00,10nice gun jack
Kencolt: I'm sure some non-brits will appreciate your explanation. :)
DEDBOTS :D
SafariMonkey: Just making sure.
I know I did. Thanks Kencolt. =)
SafariMonkey: TOLD you.
Sounds like what Cable TV is in the USA... but is this for broadcast TV? Do you have to pay a license to watch broadcast TV?
Kencolt: No, I told YOU!
Bear with me
Kandarihu|OldComp: same for italian tv, mind you
00,10and now you know why they flashed back to that
Kandarihu|OldComp: Yes. Mostly because at the start of UK television, every network was part of the Government.
Kandarihu|OldComp: ALL tv needs a licence if it's live
So wait, when you say a license for your tv set, do you mean for the actual machine as well as the service to watch the programming??
Gold_Demona: To watch TV as it is broadcast you need a licence
Well, that's government for you.
Not compatable? KICK THE SHIT
I see. So it's like Cable then.
Inb4 she gets shot
lol dat Face of Boe
Kandarihu|OldComp: Well, it pays for the BBC (not the government), So it pays for doctor who.
Gold_Demona, except it's for broadcast TV.
Right
Gold_Demona: except it's shitty national channels :D
6_9
heh
SafariMonkey, and how do the British who are not fans of Dr. Who feel about this?
That robot has the -__- expression constantly :D
Ann is rarely impressed
SafariMonkey: If I'm not mistaken most popular sports broadcasts and news are BBC?
I know that it's said that all the British love Doctor Who, but there are always exceptions for claims that EVERYONE is part of a certain fandom.
Kencolt: I believe so
DED
:O
Nuuuuuuu, Rose is ded! D:
And then Rose was totally dead. Yup. Absolutely.
Thus... a LOT of people pay for that, and also the licence covers a lot of popular imports and te like.
Kandarihu|OldComp: It pays for national television. Bonus is 0% advertising!
No music would make this scene much more potent
Petrified_Discord: can't you believe it? But it's so convincing!
i'm a brit and i don't particularly like dr who :/
magmablock: You got your wish
Howdy BronyInstrumental :)
Dat security
Lol. Nice security
I was talking about the scene where Rose got vaporized, but a lot of scenes work
Holla everypony! :)
hi MadSurge, i got here a while ago :S
PERFECT SECURITY
hi GilDash
Hey GilDash!
hi GilDash #
Withagun!
In a society where they expect eveyone to obey-- and everyone does-- resistance is totally effective.
BronyInstrumental: yeah, but I just noticed
:D
that is one BFG
Eccleston Doctor doesn't take shit from ANYONE. Fukken LOVE that guy.
He's also a bit of a grouch. I liked that about him. =)
SafariMonkey, you know what? Commercials aren't really all that bad. It sure beats having to pay for everything you see on TV. And the breaks are good times to take breaks, or even mentally digest the act of the show.
Not TOO grouchy, but enough to be interesting
Nice existence, being the processor of a computer since the age of 5
MadSurge, sounds like a fate worse than death to me.
Commercials are awesome. They research what we want to buy and present it in a clear and usually amusing fashion. They're doing the shopping for us!
Gold_Demona: He's really fresh from the Time Wars, and Number 8 who fought it-- it's still fresh to his mind.
Kandarihu|OldComp: Yeah, I take breaks, but do you realise that about 30% of your viewing time is advertising?
Kencolt: Yesh
heckler and koch must make a killing in the future
NOT DED
SafariMonkey, I'd imagine that would be unbearable for someone who isn't used to it.
DAT FAKE DEATH
WHAT A TWIST!
Inb4 EXTERMINATE
Let's do the plot twist dance!
Kandarihu|OldComp: I don't watch continuously,
OH NO!
I just don't like having only 70% yield on my time
And I just relaized how stupid taht sounds
is that a pilot suit?
was wondering when these guys would show up
Gotta go. Have fun!
Some of these commercials are pretty entertaining in their own right.
magmablock: yes, but don't spoil it for all the others.
of course
magmablock: :O
magmablock: too many bad puns
They're not THAT many
Eccleston's most famous speech inbound
:D
Kandarihu|OldComp: I appreciate that.

soo what doctor is this one ?
Snow: Cylinder robots are taking over the world with television
The_Browncoat: 9th, i think
END OF SERIES
^
Kencolt, it's kind of risky to bundle your phone service with the same company you have your TV and Internet service from. If there's a billing problem with your TV/Internet provider, they'll yank your service, and you'll have to phone them to straighten things out.
Kandarihu|OldComp: BBC does football, I don't know how it works though
End of season, you mean,. Fun fact-- Eccleston 's contract was for One Year-- because he'd decided to play the role for only one year, since he had other commitments-- but he had to take the role just once.
I heard once that if your phone is part of that bundle, the same billing problem that cuts off your TV and Internet also cuts off your phone service. So it'll be harder to sort things out.
okay i have never seen doctor who, so i dont know the plot... im clueless atm xD
Wow, Nine has a huge nose
I just go with it, I never watched it until the other day either
Kencolt: but the ones that DO work, they never carry them around!

"I see every atom of your existence, and I divide them!"

What episode is this?
twilight_sprinkle: Especially the music. Ot's not really fitting.
twilight_sprinkle: Soundtrack Dissonace?
BY FIRE BE PURGED!
and then he died
HOW CAN THIS BE
SafariMonkey: Song dissonance is kind of like playing a happy song while someone's getting beat up.
Jack's not dead! Yay!
SafariMonkey: not th same
00,10She because celestia and luna
He got better
Gold_Demona: well he CAN'T die!

MadSurge: He was dead, but Rose brought him back.
OH MAI
omg doctor REALY?
sooooo, if i walk in a telephone both i can kill everyone and bring everyone back to life?
boooo
that was a lame pun...
What eoisode is this?
AJIsAwesome|Homework: I know, I wasn't sure what he meant, and twilight_sprinkle, I know
'I think you need a doctor' *Ding Dong* *Hello Sailor* and all that jazz
did she just transfer a disease to him?
SafariMonkey: Oh, ok. Sorry. :$
dat breath!
twilight_sprinkle: I think he got his powers back.
So I'm guessing Rose is dead?
AJIsAwesome|Homework: No Problem, I probably would have reacted the same to my ambiguous query.
AJIsAwesome|Homework: biiiitch be dead yes
AJIsAwesome|Homework: Nope.avi. Just give the good doctor a bit to explain it.
MadSurge: And because Rose literally brought him back from the dead, he can't die now.
twilight_sprinkle: Oh. Sorry. :$
twilight_sprinkle: venereal
dammit i was wrong
Sumica, mind if I msg you the link to this little parody of this I found?
Petrified_Discord: ah k
00,10he's regenorating

Two mistakes in one day. Sheesh, I'm on a roll today. :D
o.o
Oh this joke
its still fonneh
what if derpy was rose in that scene?
that would have been awsome i guess
MOST EPIC REGENERATION
And he becoms SO MUCH BETTER
UND DANN DAVID TENNANT
Takes a level in AWESOME
Fun Fact : this is the first regeneration when the doctor is standing
WUT
Everythings fine, oh wait no i'm dying
Imagine if the 9th, 10th, and 11th Doctors had a crossover?
What episode is this?!
Bronysith: I love the regen supercuts
her lips man
How many episodes did they have of the 9th doctor?
Petrified_Discord: there is no 11th doctor :D
the episode of magic light
13, I think
ded?
MadSurge: Matt Smith
ORGASMS EVERYWHERE
O_O
whut
MadSurge: He does not exist
wut
WUT?
wat
MadSurge: :P
Wow.......this is the best doctor right?
Petrified_Discord: yep
6_9
Number 10?
AJIsAwesome|Homework: this is?...
6_9
This is David Tennant, right?
*mind blown*
AJIsAwesome|Homework: matter of opinion
g2g bye
Kandarihu|OldComp: *ding ding ding*
Yep, David Tennant
AJIsAwesome|Homework: there is no best doctor, there is only... the doctor
if that was best doctor, then i am dissappoint
I LIKE Matt Smith. He reminds me o Tom Baker. And Colin Baker. Kind of in a blender.
AJIsAwesome|Homework: Of the new series, *by far*
Oh, I didn't notice you giving me permission. I hope I wasn't too late.

Thank, Sumica for the stream. :)
Kencolt: top 3 doctors to the expert are?

AJIsAwesome|Homework: there is a Picard, Kirk relationship between tennant and baker really
AJIsAwesome|Homework: those 2 are the most popular
He's off to lunch.
Thanks for the stream Sumica!

Bronysith: Okay.

Snow: Yes.

mentallyeffedguy: Yep.
mentallyeffedguy: Sumica's end-of-stream clip
hahahahaha thats funny
EETS BACON AND APOLJECK! DERE AWWRITE!
In my humble opinion? Well, Tom Baker is iconic to me (Number 4, the one with the scarf), and yes, David Tennant, and Peter Davison.
We almost died, it was great!
11 is best doctor
It's stll very close, though
I like 11. He took a little getting used to, but I ended up really liking him
Who's streaming next?
magmablock, Almost what?
TOM BAKER OR GTFO.
Is Sumica streaming after lunch?
i have no idea what i just watched. i know its g1 but those...sea ponies.
kthxjellybabies.
they scare me

Snow: Look at the 4th panel :P http://equestria.fadri.org/043-next-season-on-my-little-pony
^Win
if you're gonna have a deus ex machina, what better way?
I DO like Smith's doctor. As I said, he's like a mix of the Fourth (the most eccentric at times) and the Sixth (Who was often on the verge of insanity-- he had a bad regeneration).

Wrek I could make some avatars for models or ideas of you wish to do the combinations?
he's good
unless you don't need them ofcrouse :)
Wrek: I kind of think it would be amusing to see twilght Sparkle in Majot Katsuragi (from GiTS) uniform.
Before you ask my down speed id 45 Mb per second
*is
If you can call that a uniform.
*by down speed I mean to the internet not the router
Believe it or not in the culture I lived in in africa they didn't put walls around wells (30m+) because they believed that if someone fell that was God's will. So this isn't too far from the present.
Well, that fish dinner was delicious :)
PONY
its amazing what 30 minutes of swordplay can do
MadSurge: THAT must've been..... a lot of fish
PONY
Ye you can lose a limb or 2

CCCP: still sad?

I get so many Agro vibes from that horse.
Hello Klumzeedragon
I'll have a different name
Evening, everybrony.

Kandarihu|OldComp: Arn? :P
Hello everypony
Hi malevolent (tab stopped working?)

Thank CELESTIA for the captions. The languages bounce around like Pinkie Pie on a crack flavored cupcake.
Saladin.

mentallyeffedguy: The 4th wall: The screen that divides the audience from the cartoon, movie, or series. It becomes BROKEN when one of the characters A) Look a the screen B) Admit that they're fictional C) Read their own script D) Saying hello to us E) Pull off a joke that WE, the audience was thinking, OR F) All of the Above.
Woooah
Because they knew all 4 languages fluently
And then the templars lose.
Badly

Ooo?
I have to see this
What movie is next?
hi everypony, what was just on
Joy: cars 2
Wrek: that awesome archer from norway that fights like a viking
mentallyeffedguy, for veik for veik er kongens bue?
And I'm going to miss part of the next-- I have to make a huge pot of chili. Otherwise I won't be eating for a few days. BBL!
And the new Ace attorney game will have voice acting...
Kencolt: sounds fun
Have fun Kencolt.
bye Kencolt
Kencolt: Bye! :)
Goodbye Kencolt :)
Bronysith: then it isnt an ace attorney game
Later Kencolt
cowvarkian: how not?
Bronysith: because racecar?
Bronysith: give that game a boot to the head...
Vivix: jeg har ikke sett hele arn 2, men litt :P
05casue otehrwise you're all fucked
bye Kencolt
Eli: that too
Inb4 we're all fucked.
mentallyeffedguy, I haven't seen any of them- but he's the only fameous norwegian archer I know..Tambarskjelve?
is that like tambarine
Wrek: Most of us. :P
We can all sit here and powertranslate, it will be the worst experience ever for our foreign amtes
:)
Wrek: We're screwed either way because of poor translations
Vivix: Yep. :D
Vivix: But it will be hilarious
hehe
Thaat It will PillowPoni
05Obsidian: not the same translater this time
05so hopign for the best
Vivix: i dont know who he is :P
same translator is best translator
Take in the fact that I suck at swedish, and it get's worse
inb4 worse translation than the first
Eh he was the kings main bowman or something- and he said the kings bow was too weak for him, when his own broke in battle
/me prepares food before he misses more awesome action
i thought the film was good
I don't know Swedish at all. This will be a fun ride
Use google translate :D
Wrek: We're counting on you to translate for us should it be bad ;).
Wrek: We'll see
"Oh king, oh king, your bow is too weak" or something
a horse, my kingdom for a horse...
Wrek can do facecam and be the like the guy who reads to the deaf folks in sign language.
hehe yes!
when i get my own pc, and my friends find out what sites ive been too im fucked :P
or blind fols in sign language
05Everlasting_Joy: sure thing
*folks
cowvarkian why would you read to blind people in sign language?
why not
Because they can't see?
mentallyeffedguy: You'll be fine
mentallyeffedguy: That depends? What sits have you been going to?
None of my friends cared- but I don't know if your agegroup cares about it?
MLP_Brovakiin: no, i wont, none of my friends are bronies
Is MLP even well known outside of the norwegian bronies?
AJIsAwesome|Homework: this one...equestria daily and that sorta stuff
Need icecream. :3
I don't think anyone would recognize it if I wore a shirt
mentallyeffedguy: Pfft! You'll be fine.
ill be staying in the closet
mentallyeffedguy: Neiter are any of mine, if they are truelly your friends they will get over it. hopefully
patrik olterman! you better be a good translater!
Whatnow? That's not really close to anything I said
I know
mentallyeffedguy: Most of my friends aren't bronies, and I couldn't really care if they see me watching ponies or not.
so is this part 2?
What I mean is that I've not met anyone who cares outside of fans around these parts
Dusty: Eeyup.
Did I miss anything?
Are we watching it again?
sure
cool
Safari_eating: Nope.
05Patricia: part 2
Safari_eating: Nope, just began
Oh, okay
cool
05spot on
05its the dogs bollocks
Wrek: Let us know when it starts to go south
and i still don't understand why dogs testicles are any better then regular ones
The dog's bollocks? I'm pretty sure those are bad.
05tSparx: actually no
05british slang
tSparx: It is an old saying :P
cowvarkian: logic does not need to occur
tSparx: no, for some reason the dogs bollocks are good
/me makes innappropriate zoophilia joke
Well, I should rephrase: I don't like dogs' bollocks.
Translation: Bee's knees
elephant's anus
Brosa? That's way too close to Brona. My inner nerd is telling me to go questing for the Sword of Shannara just in case.
hehe
ikr
I recognize the Britons' slang, but I prefer bees' knees to dogs' bollocks :D
SafariMonkey: i'm pretty sure bees don't have knees...
SafariMonkey: or the cat's pajamas
Wrek how'd you become a mod?
CCCP-: what time rift did you pop out of
CCCP-: good fucking question
05i said "i can do arts"
05and they wen "hired"

True story.
cowvarkian I was watching you sleep

Lesson learned.
Wrek yeap- historically accurate
Wrek: Just like a Razorback
or on your back, Wrek
strangely enough, i don't like horses
That was just English :)
I've come to like them

Oh, no, it actually was haha
wait, why is this suddenly english
Runnnn
they're in an international part with multinational people
cowvarkian: Has ENglish speaking moments
The languages change all over the place.
I can believe that
because you know, scandinavia
Aimbot.

Well this is in templar lands- they probably woulda spoken french?
LIKE BOSS!

BladedWings: Flashback to 1st movie
http://fav.me/d5drypd
Scandinavian movies are so uncensored, if anyones ever seen.. Gymnaslærer ..something? Crazy amount of sex and nudity- and we saw that in school
SafariMonkey: oh...never seen it
Jeez man. Take it easy.
05SCANDINAVIAN PRIDE!
05FUCK YEAH
hehe
:D
BladedWings: Just finished it in stream
Scandinavian Pride indeed.
awww
WE DON'T need no sword for our fun
Vikins
oh god! østlandsk! its so evil!
PROMOTION!
sounds like running shit in my ears
....
skuffet, besviken
It's like Skavlan all over again
skavlan er kjedelig
Vivix: Swedish and Norwegian is actually some difference with words and their own languages.
hehe
just saying
oh yeah it's very different
Same with Danish as well
I'm Norwegian
ale.
Then you know what I mean :D
øøøøøøøøll
yeaah
Ul ul ul ul ululululululu
I could use an ale right now.
Viking ALE
For parties!
05ÖL FÖR ALLA!
Skavlan has that weird norwegian with swedish words shoehorned in, it's odd to listen to
ølølløløløløløløløløløløl
ÖL!
(Imagines that Pinkie is a viking)
the new trolololoool
I can understand 90% of norwegian and 50% of swedish... Pretty different, but really similar. :/
Öl erryday.
Øl! Øl! Og mere øl! da da da da
Vordox: You just won, ALLL my internets.
Wrek: isn't that what a terrorist says before blowing up?
I can understand maybe 40-50 percent Swedish, some of the words are just--so different
Öl Party style!
i can do french :P
I kinda want to learn Samisk
Vivix: Same. Also mentallyeffedguy same too
mentallyeffedguy: so do I... i still don't like it
Sami!?
/me doesn't speak a word of what ever languages are being typed/ spoken
Eli: french sucks really
:)
LEARN ALL THE LANGUAGES!!!
Yeah, I think Sami sounds kinda cool
Yeah sure it's a Beautiful languages, but the very roots of their pronounciations is REALLY different.
Lulu Same or what it is around these parts
Vivix: me too
mentallyeffedguy: i agree. I'm now in my 3d year at an all french school...
Everyone! I have something to say!
mentallyeffedguy: i hate it
Swedish. Spitfire.
Vivix: Written they are very similar, but spoken, the difference is accentuated
Aircrafter: your point
aah
Eli: worst languege. EVER
mentallyeffedguy: far from it
I like french too-
cowvarkian: Swedish. Spitfire.
cowvarkian: you've never heard swedish spitfire?
I like most languages
doesnt even make sense, its just many sounds
Convictions does a man good and bad.
Awkward conversationalist Arn.
mentallyeffedguy: I think you've confused French with Chinese
Spectrum_Rush: i have :P
DO YOU SEE THE FJORDS
mentallyeffedguy: oh hell yeah!. my friends and i used to say: english is made of rules, french is made of exceptions :)
hehe
Chinese is the language that relies greatly on sounds
WindWhistler: chinese is awesome
05anotehr mug o mead chug anotehr mug o mead and another mug o mead 'til you fall down
I think you'll find that speech in general relies pretty greatly on sound.
aircrafter, I don't see a point to it
If I could, I'd learn all the languages, cause they're all so cool
Chinese is confusing. A change of pitch can change the meaning completely
Wrek: You are connected to Vikings? :p
That's true of many languages though
cowvarkian: Have you heard Swedish Spitfire?
WindWhistler: do you know chinese?
yes
Rikissa died off screen!?
mentallyeffedguy: No, but I know that's how it works.
05Vordox: hm?
like ..just change the beat and pitch of a normal word, mangles it completely
Chug a mug of mead and another mug of mead chug another mug of mead warrior.
cowvarkian: Well there you go. Thats my point.
Miracle of Sound.
Meanwhile: that was genius :)
Eli: I find the opposite. english has *so* many exceptions
Good stuff.
05aknar bara ett skägg
Wrek: Vikinga blod. :)
05men det e på väg så
Aircrafter: then your point is pointless
05saknar*
Skarufådækjægg?
05and more or less vordox yes
Aircrafter: No, I don't believe I am, and the point is pointless
Oh...
Take care WindWhistler!
shit..
wer
Bye WindWhistler
SafariMonkey: what? english is like the easiest language ever! i never even payed attention to a single class in school, but stil i'm here :)
cowvarkian: How is Swedish Spitfire pointless?
Oh crap
Those eyes of the eminence..
I think I have Viking blood- I havent done much root research
i want to learn russian, russians are so cool
All of a sudden, CAMEL
Russian looks nice, yeah
Camel!
Ohai.

Maybe if I were born in some other country I'd be able to hold a single conversation.
Wrek: How long is this film?
/me is peeved

Wrek: do you have school tommorow?
Eli: What nationality are you?
05mentallyeffedguy: i got... 1 class

lucky little arn watcher!
Admiral Ahkbar: It's a trap!
Camls chilling
SafariMonkey: why?
WAIT
WHAT?!
really, you didnt see this coming?
Wrek: Nice.
sorry lost my rely to the up button
Eli: Is it fair to say you watch (or have watched) a lot of english-speaking material?
Is it what I think he's going to do...
Don't hit the horse!
i got a 5 in english, thats the good part of gaming :P
Lag at the action point!
what ahppened?
Bonk.
No weapon!
One hit KO
I learned my English all on my own
Woo
Wombocombo.
As stated
SafariMonkey: of course! i make use of this awesome language i learned! but i didn't learn it by watching stuff
Scandinavians...
I got a 5 in english too- and a 5 in math, and abo 3 in anything else
We don't need no steel
But I'm going to bed now
despite getting a five in english, my english is actually pretty bad
bye bye everypony
Sonny: Night! :)

Goodnight Sonny
Wut.
what a douche
NOT THE HORSIE!
not the hoooooorse
MY HORSE
sounds so wrong
It was mine too, but you know. capitalizing, comma rules, OH GO
Kill that fucker!
Eli: I find that in many places people are so exposed to english, that they learn it relatively easily
Oh
Oh its on now
NOW YOU FUCKED UP!
Noo horsey D:
Isn't it said that twins will sometimes have their own way of communicating with each other with their own language?
sure
Ded.
why did he stab the horse
You killed Agro! You monsters!
Dusty: Because he was an ass.
That fucking bastard
Dusty: Kill the transportation.
AJIsAwesome|Homework: My brother and I sota have that
yeah
Now I'm sad
Agro...
SafariMonkey: yeah, naturaly... but it's still a choice
:( this movie go real sad real quick
*got
oh hes not deat. yet :(
I feel sad now. Poor horsie.
In loving memory of the horse.
/me bows her head
;(
Saddest moment in the movie
>.>
:'(
/me isnt sad
:'( not the Horsie
A moment in silence for the horsie
/me hugs horse
Love is a splendid thing, having no borders...
/me moment of silence for the horse
Amen
Is just an actor--
that horse is a good actor
Everyone be quiet, We need a moment of silence....
that horses were just tools before, not much feelings invovled except maybe someone had a favourite horse
Eli: Maybe I wasn't clear. English, I find, has as many exceptions as french, but greater exposure means they are less obvious.
mentallyeffedguy: O.o
Kinda, pit horses died a plenty, but a soldiers horse were his horse for like 20 years
mentallyeffedguy: SAY WHA?!
Spectrum_Rush: Haha :D
Vordox: its true
half true
We have stories of horses that passed legendaries themselves.
transportation horses like in London--were unloved
Vivix: eyupp
Hi.
but a farmers horse, a soldiers horse- especially a sargeants horse was hiis horse, his friend and such
Well then god is a real jackass.
SafariMonkey: duuude... i go to a completly french school... my mothertongue is german. believe me: French has way more exceptions
Vivix: Everything in london is unloved...

for some reason
MrMalk: damn right!
Vivix: you really havent met the scum of the earth then
Its Hotter than Hell out there
Well I have, but in movies they bug me more
Eli: Fair. I guess the fact that I also speak both fluently doesn't stop us from disagreeing. I guess everyone has different views, it would be pretty boring otherwise. And my main language is english, faroese I speak as a native, and french I also speak fluently. I also speak saafi saafi and can read danish.
dat religion
except you wont defeat him <.<
Cross gives no water.
The true cross can't cure dehydration.
Historically that Templar leader led them to the downfall the the Templars
I'm... I dunno
Meanwhile: Can't cure starvation, either.
or death
This is really good so far.
That dude is a terrible leader.

Its a huge cross.
yes, mentallyeffedguy
En nation, ej ett land, Inga gränser haver vi. :) <3 Norway for our brothers.
huuuge cross
I wonder where they filmed this.
mars
omg derpy chat
05images have shown that mars doesnt have that fine sand in its deserts
Do not doubt god, but doubt the messengers of god
>.>
SafariMonkey: not really: an exception is something which, while showing all signs of a rule, doesn't apply to the rule.
fine, a super planet millions of light years away
ugh it must be soo hot
it was filmed using curiosity on mars yesterday
Poofer.

Morning Rommulus
ohaim Rommulus
Eli: Then the question is defining rules. How many similar examples does it take for a group of exceptions to form a new rule?
bye CCCP
oh no, the guy did that himself cowvarkian
And every one else
bye CCCP-
SafariMonkey: they might have called it another name and made it a rule in french, but it's still an exception to the original rule.
05MrMalk: Arn: THe kingdom at ends road. its sthe secodn movie in a series of so far 2 movies
What are we watching today?
Wrek: So far?
ah i remember this mission from AoE also
05i wouldbt be surpised if the made more
"if god wills it"
what?!
Wrek: It's like the 1970-80s Oddesey! Awesome!
Is Arn based on a real guy?
SafariMonkey: take the "verbes d'hopital" for example. they form a new rule, but to me, they are an exception
05Vivix: if arn is i do not know for sure, but the events that take place are
yeah- hm
Vivix: sure, why not
Wrek its a great series Ive seen it before
also, damn Hydra. when mods ping me, prolly cause of colour, I don't get pinged
Wrek: I think I recall the book of Arn is actually an old story, but from where it came... >.>
/me shakes client
SafariMonkey: to the original rule, they are an exception* not only to me
wrek: is it much left?

Thats 1076 or some such

Vordox: He is king, so who's going to argue with him
Fl00tersh41: Give it time...

Good acting

Hello everypony.

Vivix: For some, History was just one big mess...
Hello pyrocatboy
True- I don't know it very well, but I know some local history
hi pyrocatboy
like near where I lived before there was a big swedish norwegian battle during the..løsrivelse
Wrek: Didn't Knut had 2 childrens?
or at least big enough to be recorded
I fucking hate getting blisters on my feet.
They only stipulated Erik as heir, right? But that's not who died? *just got back
05Vordox: 3
051 died
051 in battle
051 staying home
Oh...

Little Knut died, but who was the se... Oh the Templar Battle?
No, one is going in to battle
Only one died.
ah yeah

Where's Arn's son?
instantly he got army
oh now I remember whot that old man is, he was in..that movie that I saw..abou that ex con who did stuff

I fucking hate getting blisters on my feet. I just had to take a kitchen knife and put a hole in my toe.
Vivix: Air Con?
Noo..

Meanwhile: Harald
Our blood brothers <3
That's what I said.
Fatty.
cowvarkian: My response was very unclear. I understand why yu could interpret it the way you did
Oh and that is another thing, why does the other army never have extra troops that just show up before/mid way through the battle?
Is this battle also historic?
The "good" army always has something it seems.
Vivix: sure, why not
dat laugh
HAR HAR HAR
/me not sure

Swedes were amazing warriors- as far as my history memory goes
Blood for the blood god
Skulls for the skull throne
I know nothing abo Danish history though
Milk for the Khorne flakes.
Kill the guys with the funny looking helmets!
Vivix: We had a few very miracle fights, yes
Meanwhile: or for the skull god
Meanwhile: :d
Meanwhile My hovercraft is full of eels!
I know Denmark owned us for quite a while-
why dont you play speed on his face :P
Vivix: Swedish army has always been good through the ages, we do not know why though, morale, dedication, or else.
is our king from Danish heritage? Or is he Swedish? *memory
lol fail
Arn!
Moustaches for the mouse... or Meanwhile
Sweden did have acces to amazing eh..steel, and technology for their armies-
Mouse with a moustache?
Because of reasons
05Vordox: when it turned otu we DIDNt have 12 million people, we kidna went "of fuck we shouldt keep invading people"
NOT A FAIL
game over yeaaahhhh
hehehe
Wrek: That's just smart thinking, that's why we have been passive for most time, doesn't mean we don't fight unless neeedd :P
KILL EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM
ownage
finish him!
And that's how superior numbers can lose to a little brain power.
Norway was kinda the kickball of the svandinavians after viking era
kun?
erik-kun
and even in viking era we were broken up to many small kingdoms and stuff
05the sweden norwegian war lasted what, a few days?
seems legit
05neitehr side could be arsed
XD
05we love eachotehr too much <3
hmm I'm not sure
OH I SEE
A king with Mecy
Is a good sign
we were sold to Norway, and then we kinda--had a small war and then we were free?
dat boot
mercy*
Sweden <3
Finaly found the historical battle this is supposed to show
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_%C3%84lgar%C3%A5s
I bequif a boot to the face
I had been hoping for the Battle of Visby
he was hoping there would be a bottomless pit behind the guy when he kicked him
We were traded to Sweden* or something? We had this in history but god--school is a long time ago
05however it happened
Wrek: If anything, Norway and Sweden are brothers, Denmark is like Half Brother, and Finland is cousin :P
yeahh
Iceland is distant bastard child
Fl00tersh41: It's on the wiki page for Arn – The Kingdom at Road's End
05it was norways "we wanna do independence" adn we went "fuck no" then they went "we will scream!" "oh shit better let them go"
who still speak like we did ages ago
hehe, yeah
Vivix: Iceland is awesome though, like the young uncle :D
yeaah, Iceland is cool
Lawl Wrek.
now I want to read up on the history- damn movie was fun
Vivix: A sign of a good adaptation...
yeaa-
MrMalk: and one more for jenny and the wimp
why the fuck didnt our history lessons cover that?
The Faroes was irrelevent in war until the world wars
Dark_Horst: Which country's education?
Are we watching another movie after this?
i know pretty much nothing about scandinavia and it'S sitting right on top f us
We didn't have about Færøyene in our school at all ;___; I know so little about it
uhh
almost
05Patricia: had something else planned
how does that work/
oh yeah, btw I got fucked up.
Vordox: germany
Vivix History was allways my favorite class even after I graduated When I go there the History department allways knows me
Dark_Horst: Well you have a pretty hefty history as well
I wish I payed more attention to history class
hes fine
Dark_Horst: Can't cover the whole world's history
05my hads a histroy teacher
05and the histroy teacher i had at school fucking sucked
hey guys we herd you like death, so we put some bonus death in your war movie
05so the little i know he tought me
brb
Vordox: they could've at least mentioned it on the side
aahh
ohai everypony :)
Vivix: Sorry to hear that. Really, what DO they teach children in school these days?
oh brb darlings!
Hehe, indeed-
Dark_Horst: Heh, that's History :) Take the best parts only, and only the worst parts.
Aww!
Arn... died though <.<
back
HE DIED FOR THEIR SINS
Vordox History is written by the victors
Noooo.....
MrMalk: I know.... It's sad.
DJ Jesus died for your spins.
he ded?
nuuuuuuuuuuuu
AND THUS
http://cheezburger.com/6554966784
why wasn't it rivalt!!
The story of Arn ends.
ikr Meanwhile
History is written by........ A PENCIL! DUN DUN DUUUUUUUN
Meanwhile: I prefer RaptorJesus
Aww!
Bronysith: ikr
He whent extinct for our sins
marf?
Vordox to be honest there is so much politics in history textbooks I would be surprised if now adays people are uptodate from what we know from the 1970s
Back from dinner. What happened?
Arn died.
AJIsAwesome: Arn died
MrMalk: HAH! Good observation.
Wb AJIsAwesome
Aw, man.......
wb AJIsAwesome
AJIsAwesome: I imagine a person just walking into this funeral with food on the plate and saying "Did I miss something"
Vordox: Oh, that's terrible! :D
Wrek: what happened to Arn's son?
Vordox Because as a fact the first civilization was in europe that was discorverd during the cold war is it in our textbooks no will it be in the next 20 years no
Vordox: Oh god lol
<3
and that's how sweden was made
-old Schwarzenegger
Sweden, bless you for what you are, not for what you can be.
And that's how Equestria was made!

Everlasting_Joy: ur right
/me puts Everlasting_Joy in a full nelson
Need to leave for the moment. Later everypony.
Mica can you make me a sandvich
bye Obsidian
:O Wreky still streaming? Daaaaaayum
/me takes Bronysith to the ground because he knows how to escape a full-nelson.
Wrek: viking pony?
Does it happen to be the case that anyone here can recommend a fan fiction they really liked?
/me doesn't know wrestling. Stays out of it
SafariMonkey if it doesnt have pictures, i dont like it. my imagination is fried.
I mainly read shipping, maybe
:P
to be clear, I am looking for *story* fan fiction
/me is so pleased with how Wreky's drawing is coming out ;3
have you read off the map and apoptosis SafariMonkey? /beware misspellings and memoryfail
those two are adventure and story heavy things- I really liked them
Some implied romance, but not a lot
Gnight everypony HF with the art :)
I have read Night's favoured child (so far) and about 6 others
Take care Michael!
/me has read far too much fanfiction
I read these over a couple days
Nights favoured child was pretty good
/me is still trying to get into fanfics.
cya
i've probably read about 2.5k words so far I suppose
So......''A Canterlot Wedding'' is getting it's encore this saturday morining!!!!!!!
yay
F*** TO THE YEAH!
*250k
Hopefully that's an indication of season 3 coming soon
Dark92Invalid: I've got it on iTunes and DVD, but yay!
I've read 8 million words I think
on the fimfictoin estimate
Corn on the cob, corn on the kabob!
vivix where is that?
Fimfiction.net
The fanifics I've read all the way through could be counted on one hand. But two of them are Fallout Equestria and Project Horizons, sooo...
on your userprofile it says estimated words read
I got taco sauce on my ipod
~1.5 million words there
also, Off the edge of the map, and Apotheosis are two of my favourite adventure/story heavy fics
both around 40 K so not too long
oh wait, Knighty removed estimate AGAIN
gonna go for now guys, see ya later...thanks for the stream and HF with the art Wrek
Ceeya BladedWings
BladedWings: Bye! Your nickname is awesome! :)
AJIsAwesome: thanks, again another one off the top of my head %_%
*^_^
Take care BladedWings!
BladedWings: No problem. Wish I could come up with stuff like that.
Vivix: Could I have fimficton links?
Wrek, are we allowed to post the links? Or should I just query them?
magmablock: Are those good?
Extremely
Really dark though, so be warned if you're squeemish
LOL after browsing derpibooru and seeing all the "questionable place holder pics", I finally figured out that there are actually pics there being hidden and not just a ton of reposts of the "questionable" pic
hahaha
magmablock, Oh I love FoE- but haven't read project horizon yet. You kinda have to enjoy that fallout style to love those stories
but I aboslutely love them- currently reading FoE: Hero by No one
Love this one <3
VikingCanary: oh hey, you are viking now
I've been meaning to check that one out. What can you tell me about it?
Oh Brad[Laptop] hehe
cya
00,10Canary <3
Vivix another funny thing is i kind of like the placeholder pic hahaha
magmablock, I think it works really well so far, don't feel like it breaks the fanon, and I really like the moral greyness of it- I like the main character, she's very different from the others I read
It's also like..as I told the author in my fanboygasm, the first chapter gets sadder and sadder the more I read
sorry i derped out >.>
Neat, I'll be sure to give it a gander
I think next of hte FoE for me is Project Horizon, or New Beginnings (I want to try it- despite it kinda spooking me)
05Great strength is the one who shows mercy
05if you wonder about the boot rune
05s
It's a great read, good pacing so far and such. It's more of the NV style, but not really latching onto any of the story from the games
Wrek: True words, true words.
....That's awesome Wrek.
Vivix: go for horizons, i love it
PH has a few pacing issues, sometimes it takes forever to get anywhere and other times a huge revelation is explained in like 3 sentences, but when it gets going, it's hard to put down.
It also somehow manages to be even darker than the original
Ooh? Neat- what's the main char like?
05atleast as clsoe as i can get off my memory
Dark_Horst, I think I will- it's finished right?
PH also seem to have the problem that its auhor canz decide on an endin^^
Vivix: nope
Ooh
waiting for chapter 50 atm
how many words? I think I heard 800K
but i think its somewhere in the last third
She's a lazy Stable security officer who gets swepped up in the action outside when her Stable gets an unfriendly visitor. She can get a little angsty sometimes, but other times she's one of the most fun characters I've ever read.
ah akai
well, looks like i get to stay a little longer ^_^
Especially when she gets drunk
Hehe
BladedWings: :).
BladedWings: Yay! :D
FoE is one of the few fic universes where I like drunkenness
it fits the mood-
fail
she also seems to catch every shit that gets tjrown around somewhere in the hoofington wasteland
magmablock: what am I missing, I only see about 0.5k from what you said, not 1.5k
magmablock: or typo?
Must be
Vivix: FoE?
hehe, hmm sounds like a good read- what about eh-- any romance?
Fallout Equestria
00,10soooooooo, where do pony vikeings get leather?
oh thought so :$
Sumica: your shins
from their foes Sumica
.....Oh my o3o
00,10next we need pony in glass armor
There's a bit of romance, but it tends to take a back seat
00,10seeing as this one seems to be in banded
Well, sounds like a good mix- I think it'll be the next I read after No One's
I don'tmind romance, but I don't want it to be the main focus. NO PWP
probably read pink eyes between them, as it's a bit shorter. Also been meaing to check out some new ones, but I'm scared of going into one that breaks the universe canon and mucks about in 'OC' land-
I adooore romance, but in a fic like FoE it's kinda best as motivation or..backseat
Greetings!
silly Sumica, that's obviously guard armor
Greetings!
I came here after seeing the royal wedding encore thing on EqD. Am i right in hoping it will be on here?
I love to write romane fics on fimfiction
Stormcloak guard armor
Just be warned. If you thought the original was dark, PH is pitch black at times. Just wait until you get to chapter 22
Bam
22, a recurring number
DalemixFawte: Hello! :)
and yeah I like dark when dark is done well
Like Little Pip's drug addiction, and the end- I really liked
I hape Mike is having a good sap 8)
Same here. Most of the fics I read of dark. I just really like dark stories in general
basically I am absolutely fine with romance, but I hate the ones that think that PWP is ok
pony_9567: Try asking the mods. Maybe they'll help you.
sooooo, just finished installing the first deus ex on windows 7 and going to try it out. wish me luck
Yes, yes.. Hello.
00,10So jelly, just saw some one get a gold bot killer wrench a bit ago
What's up¿
and romance-containing ones?
I tend to avoid dark tag because of the whole.."i'ma top cupcakes" trend, but good dark is amazing- I love it
SafariMonkey: PWP?
Damn straight
I write some dark fics too
Like you said, the story arc with Pip's addiction. That had me glued to the screen
but not cupcake
Yeah what is PWP? and Applejack2012 what you write?
Sumica: Do you know if the Canterlot Wedding encore will be aired here?
AJIsAwesome: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PWP first entry.
Yeah the addiction was done so well, I loved it. I just--it camse so slowly that I almost didn't notice it- and then it just dawned on me that she--was so heavily in to it that she didn't either
00,10this saterday, yeah
YAY
Canterlot Wedding encore?
I write romance, adventure and dark Vivix
00,10mind you they have reaired it like 3 times already
SafariMonkey: Okay.
What's your fimfict username?
I joined the herd the day after it aired. So i haven't had a chance to watch a single episode live yet. lol
if you want plot in your clop, try romance reports. it does incredibly well on the story.side
00,10but my guess is this one, because they are advertiseing it and such will have the anouncment ad for when s3 starts
Most of those never become very popular anyway
Dark_Horst, totally
Vivix: Same
That's actually pretty realistic. Most addicts don't realize they have a problem until they find out they've been going through 4 packs a day
i can truly and honestly say i read romance reports for the plot. ACTUAL plot
00,10You sould join us friday for movie night pony_9567
pony_9567: Welcome to Bronystate! Make sure to read the rules here and I'm sure you'll have a great time here! :)
00,10and if you stick around pick a name so every one can get to know you
pony_9567: http://derpiboo.ru/2604
yeah magmablock I felt it really hit the nail on the head. It was just so well done-
Like me. I know my nick isn't that diffrent buy hey I'm the only Ponies(Numbers here) :3
Vivix: To be clear, SafariMonkey is my FIMFiction username
The Herd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111
pony_9567: If you want to change your nickname, type "/nick" and then your nickname. :)
It's all I could think of gimme a break! D:
SafariMonkey, oh eyah, but Applejack2012's one?
Lol
oh
/me hugs Ponies47
SafariMonkey: Is it bad that whenever I see your name I think of Agent Monkey from Dexter's Laboratory?
/me Hugs Vivix back
What's everypony doing?
Dusty: Nothing much. Just doing some homework.
Speaking of homework......

Bronysith, hopefully there'll never be a FFVII remake
00,10Wrek is streaming
CrimsonPhoenix: what? why?
DalemixFawte: Wrek is. He's a great artist.
DalemixFawte: Wrek.
DalemixFawte: People do art and play games and play videos on there, and we chat about it over here
Oh.
Bronysith, just think about it
lol.
And about whatever, really
Bronysith, just think of SquareEnix today
It's delicious, Wrek
CrimsonPhoenix: righto
Did anypony else stream today while I was at school or has Wrek been stream all day/night again?
Bronysith, just think of what they have done.
CrimsonPhoenix: if it went back to say, squaresoft
00,10been wrek most of the day
Ponies47: Wrek has been streaming for a LONG time. :D
FFVII just....won't be the same

00,10I streamed some dr who this morning
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Still up Wrek? My word man. You never rest. :P
The newsletter states what film and episodes
Had too much shit when I was CrimsonPeewee
Lul too slow
:P
Take notes guys, I think this is the main problem when new people come in *from IRC* -- namely, they don't realise that it is companion to a stream.
Hey
and again on saturday for us europeans
Lol.
I might use it here and there though
I need to catch up on Doctor Who, I've only seen the first 2 episodes :/
DalemixFawte: Does that help?
Brb
Well, yes, but what kind of movies'
¿
DalemixFawte: They're user chosen through a lottery drawing.
Has this been a 15 hour stream Wrek or have you actually had a break at some point?
*mod chosen*
00,10movies picked by viewers
AJIsAwesome|Homework: Shh
To Netf.. Oh wait my dad doesn't have Netflix :<
http://static.quickmeme.com/media/social/qm.gif

SHADOW OF THE COLOSSUS OST Y U SO AWESOME?!
00,10it was back in december when we did an all pony ep marathon
The phone rand and the name on the caller id was "name" o.o
DalemixFawte: The only reason why I know exactly what to tell you is that I was in your exact positon a couple days ago, and i didn't realise all the things i ust told you
Klumzeedragon: Oh God. If I ever become a mod or atleast +V here. Yeah :$
DalemixFawte, you could talk to the mods about that- advertisement and links and such is eh- yeah moddecided
DalemixFawte: By the way, if you want to type someone's name faster, type their name partially and push tab.
I wasen't a brony until Febuary of 2012 :/
I wonder if Bronystate will do one of those for season 3's launch
Sumica, we still need that Season 1 and 2 marathon before season 3
Oh.
Bronysith: I LOVE SoTC's soundtrack.
mitamaking: BTW, what did you want?
Hope for another FiM maraton
I was answering you but said AppleDash

Welp.

Ponies47: I'd never sleep if I was mod. :P I'd zombie stream everything.
mitamaking: I did?
DashWithRainbows: And hello mod I never met! :)
[19:39:29] <Applejack2012> I did not know about Bronystate until early this year
I said
Klumzeedragon I'm not a mod.
[19:39:39] Same here AppleDash
That's a nice... uh... name...
mitamaking: Oh. Sorry. :$
I meant to say your name AJIsAwesome|Homework
DashWithRainbows: Oh? I thought the + and @'s were for mods only. :P
me too mita
maybe he got his name changed?
and his name litereally was name
Klumzeedragon: Then you would die if you did not sleep at all. Plus I bet another mod would just come along and hack the stream while you weren't looking :P
100 hour stream, Endless Eight forever
00,10+ is only voice
Klumzeedragon @ are moderators. % are half-ops, + is voice, which also goes to those who are part of a Bronystate department.
00,10% and @ ar mods
<.<
so + means what?
I am a mod in a chat but it's always DEAD :<
xD
It means voice. So I can talk in +m
Fffffffuuuuu work xbox live! I wants skyrim dlc!!!!

6We got half of them or so..It's something,I guess x)
Sumica: But that was clever, I'll give you that. :D
Sumica: I see what you did there. and I enjoyed it
pretty good lol
My whole class skipped a music lesson kind of by accident a couple years ago.
Wow, about 3/4 years ago now
i didn't
hack a computer, hack a computer, i`m a secret agent so i hack a computer.
6Once,this year the two of us were leaving but we came across the teacher..Awkward.. x.x
6By accident? o.o
hmmz
story time prince dari?
i liek story time
6Brb,going to get the 3D glasses to see something xD
lol alright
Well, we left our previous lesson, then just kind of stopped walking to the next lesson, there was a cricket match going on, and we just sort of stopped, and started watching that. No one said "let's skip the lesson", but we all just ended up stopping. One guy went down to the classroom to get his phone (which had been confiscated), then came back again.
6Woo! It works! ^^
.
And no one noticed our whole class standing there for about 50 minutes.
lol
6xDDD
00,10not sure about the armored tail yet
Then the whole class got an unofficial afterschool detention.
And my friend got out of it, as always. The prick.
unofficial?
He can talk his way out of anything.
princess i`m hacking your computer becuase i`m a secret agent XD
hmmm
haha
Yeah, they didn't keep a record of it, something like that.
anyone here play ogame and can spare ~10k metal and crystal?
what y u need armor on yo tail ._.
I think they normally add it to a record with 'official' detentions.
6xD
derpherp: back in those days, you needed armor for everything
Horse tail has a dock, the dock is flesh and bone
oh ok
keeping rest of the tail well protected would just be a bonus
mm probably good to protect your haunches and rump with too
if i loss my tail lol i`ll be like: yaaaayyyy
enjoy losing half your spine
Yeah, the spine continues--I can't see where he is atm
/me nomths Vivix
yaaaayyy
but it continues for a good part into the tail
hiya Jmo <3
I WUB WOO
/me hugs
6In another class,some random dude from a different school had come in on the lesson and they ended up kicking out the whole class for the last 3 hours of the day cause they just let the guy stay or something..
O_o
So much spinng, oy vey Jmo
ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Okay i am just trying to weed out the dumbasses... What was the First Fallout game called?

now that Isaw it all, I think the dock reaches to almost the second band on that tail armor
and you really want that protected-
how much us intuos4 tablet?
Bronysith: :D
6All I could think of is my annoying math teacher.. .-.
Bronysith defiantly not fallout
Fallout A post nuclear role playing game
also known as Fallout
Vivix: i am chatting with someone who thinks that fallout 3 is the first
waat- but it says 3
Bronysith: ....
Hey CCCP!
Did anyone see the contest WeLoveFine is doing?
Well of course fallout 3 is first! I mean it has a 3 in it! Duh
Hehe
AJIsAwesome|Homework, what contest is this?
6Well,we did this one thing once..Whenever the teacher would turn her back to us,we'd start clapping.We'd stop the second she would turn around..
Hi Everlasting_Joy
smash i pony like vivix, i`m a secret agent so i smash Vivix
well yeah fallout 3 is first, fallout 1-2 isnt mainstream so ofcourse they wouldent know it
6HA! Just remembered something else.. xD That specific teacher failed so many times.. x3
/me screeches at derpherp
it doesnt sound funny, but you had to be there, he looked like a retard lol
