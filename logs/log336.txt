Vector, in simple terms, is an image you can zoom into infinitely

A vector has transparent background

Without it ever losing its quality, like BMP or JPG

3:P
good evening Hellspawn
Vector = awesome ^64th power
The transparency isn't a necessity for vectors, really

Ask again later

CLOSEUP

Hey otakon~

my usb went off
Are you okay otakon?~

THE Bag completes it
the anonymous mask would be epic

I understand
I am sorry
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1789/
that fanfiction scared me mentally.
Not so much of a coincidence perhaps, as I am quite the Scratch fag~

Very funny Phase4...
I don't take no shit from the government, man

"The Plutonia Experiment"

05its plutonia
Oh, ACTA, that's why the politics. You mean that trade agreement that everyone's already signed? It's pretty much a done deal in the US at least, unless Congress can legitimately argue that it's a treaty and thus requires their ratification. :/
Twilight is best pony
Now, imagine if you took the difficulty level of the Kaizo Super Mario Brothers, and transplated it into Doom 2.

You mean a chimicherry?
05,15how would one create a cherrychunga though

13now go blow it on a squishy ceiling! X3
^
what MahBoi777 said

maaybe some powdered sugar on top
And apparently the people who made some liked it
lol
Take a chimichanga, and add cherries?
I bet it's good
13you really gotta let them infight more :)
I wonder what would that taste like~
I would use something like a puff pastry instead of a tortilla
13canary~
so much wasted health and armour
Sounds like a cherry pancake or something
send me a pm if you'd like to see it. I dont want to post it live while Wrek is playing
Hey LadyCanary ^^
Though I don't know how the butter would fare with the deep frier
When did people actualy start chatting?
Hiii Shizuka :3 hi everyone. Yaaaay Wreky's playing Doom :D
2 minutes ago
ohai LadyCanary
Wreky is playing doom~
you mean in general?
Original Doom?
05,15is it just me or are there some graphics mods in this?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YgmJCSQXwg these guys made some
hey LadyCanary
Music or Silent version?
or here
Oh I mean Plutonia~ Or something like that~
Doom 2: Plutonia Experiment
13wrek is playing the doomsday port of doom 2, with The Plutonia Experiment
Ah
Never played the doom games
Davie jones locker~ Arrg~
Weird, usually by now I'd have someone saying: "You never played Doom before?"
and then the chat died
those explosions look out of place
And no, it's supposed to be a conbonation of 'Davie Crocket' and 'Indiana Jones'
unfortunately*
Well I haven't played doom soo~
just saw a hilarious comment on YT on a K-Pop song.
It's hard to make myself go back to 2.5D
Get ALL of the ammo
oooh webons cashe FTW!
it looks like minecraft without being intentionally bad
"Great Dictator does not approve of your catchy beats and sassy dance moves."
And the bad reviews of Doom 3 put me off as well
yfw this was someone's childhood
yfw?
05,15Doom 3 wasn't that bad. Just, bad design
doom 3 was fun but reviewed under the wrong mindset
yfw = your face when
I didn't mean it was bad
Well the main problem most people had was that you can't use a flashlight and a gun at the same time.
/me is listening to more gothic metal.
05,15Duct Tape mod
Aren't you playing a marine?
Kinda ruins the atmosphere hacing both
i think i could not play doom, the voices would scare the shit outta me
Smart Idea fluttercry
You would they would have run out of monsters by now

http://broniesforgood.org/
I have hopes for Bronies all around the world
donate all the money, lol
13you have just experienced a netsplit, some of your chat may have shifted during travel, use caution when opening overhead bins
how is playing
i find it easier to remember youtube codes than names...
Wrek is.
Oh, yeah, i gotta go. Bath night. And, UnFoundBug, sorry, i couldn't resist.
who?
Wrek
im back from dinner
mmmmm,, dinner
was it good?
Is Wrek on chat
05,15oh it can't be that bad *opens overhead bin, gets crushed*
mfw Wrek is still playing and the silly colt needs to sleep for school tomorrow.
Does Wrek ever sleep?
yes very good
it's fine, i actually quite like the song anyway
nnope
I just need time..I'm only 17 most of you are in your 20s. I still can accomplish my goal
sleep is for those with 9am starts
me too
Wrek doesnt sleep. His eyes NEVER close.
anyone else in the UK here?
yup me
80's ftw
05haha
its Febuary =)
05ich bin eine machine

/me drinks more cider and thinks deeply
....
@Wrek omg your on yay:(
^
yeeeeah this song
cider you say?
/me eats oats and washes it down with soymilk
never tried the stuff
I do love cider me
That episode was a little wierd if viewed from uk perspective,
cider is alcoholic in uk
i am bulletproof *haha*
apparently not in us
a round of cider for everypony
eez good time to run cowards!!
UnFoundBug: hell yeah it is
13in the US "cider' is pretty much carbonated apple juice
thats what made the episode so funny
iddqd
we have a name for that, appleade
all ponies looked like alocoholics
hm, I've never tried cider
homebrew cider is NICE
13pff god mode, it's not like I'M playing this..
CIDER.....Yay
/me 13is a compulsive god moder
iddqd god mode
cider is not alcoholic?
cider is mostly alcoholic, however the cidder in the episode was made during one day, thus no alcohol
I like merrydown cider
they sure do like their cider, especially Rainbow
Cider is unfiltered, unfermented juice.
In the US, only HARD Cider is alcoholic
oooo that makes sense
Cider is now the official drink of Brony Fandom
http://derpy.me/AhlAd
Lol hard cider in US = normal cider in UK
Cheeers!
lol
:)
You get Hard Cider by allowing Fresh Cider to ferment which will happen because cider has no preservatives
I though hard means distilled
I havnt seen non--alocoholic cider in UK at all
+t
If you add preservatives to cider, you get juice
how does one make cider?
Sticky, its just applejuice
iddqd?
at leas good cyeder doesnt lol
not sure why I did that
non alcoholic cider is thick apple juice
UnFoundBug: lol
You crush apples.
That's how you get cider
that's it?
CRUSH!
my friend said that the ponies were all drunks and I said that the cider was made and then served the next day. It didnt have time to ferment
eeyup
MahBoi, in US, crush apples, in UK, applejuice femented with yeast and honey
I wonder what cider taste like~
13wrek, mancubus takes three rockets, shoot at range as you run up
You just crush and crush until they turn into liquid
/me jumps our of the shadows and glomps everyone
13or that
:O
made a batch once left it to ferment too long
Rain: Sometimes they don't even wait a day.
I see, thank you
cider cider cider cide .....everyone
In Mexico, we call cider "Sidral"
we nevcer found out what happened that night
Its kinda like strong applejuice Nyria
cider cider cider :)
never tried cider...we have beer here

Oh kirzstryfe you and your noms
Phase4: Ohhh :3 nice, going to give it a try
Guys!!!!!
/me 0,5will stand up to Vi as a Newbie
Dermathil: what?
my main hatred i will admit is less the game itself, more nintendo
/me noms kirzstryfe 's tail
Listen to this: there are plans for a worldwide release for the Phoenix Wright movie!!!
A deathmatch against Vi?~ Is it possible to even hurt vi~ Because who would?~
0,5I challenge you to a *gets pawnched to the moon*
05,15inb4 LC dies
13deathmatch.... i am bad at deathmatch....
Dermathil: wait what?
You start out as a prisioner, you get freed because you are the hero, you go save the world in a massive world and use skills that you level up.
/me cheers and and throws bacon and plastic bottles into the arena
0,5You mean inafter
IT's all the same!
THIS
Your argument is invalid
Dermathil: :3
*plastic bottles of maple syrup
shouting at dragons is new
/me found Phoenix Wright toilet paper. WAT.
"*crying* so much happy..... *sniff* " second comment
And so is overworld bosses and dungeons.
Like Skyward Sword has
They are both the same in taht regard.
Oh Phase4 about that addon is there a chrome version?~
Oh, and laser sword beams
Nyria: not yet, its aqward to get it to wark
/me is hyper hyped for the Phoenix Wright movie!!!
work'
aparently its hard to make chrome wark
hows that multiplatform? oh wait its nintendo
05,15HOLD IT! There's a Phoenix Wright movie?
is it bad that i'm more hyped for MLP Turnabout Storm III than i am for the actual Phoenix Wright movie?
Phase4: Oh okay~
There's amovie?
What's your point? The game is built around the Wii's controler
Mutterguy: yes.
and the cast is GODLY.
motion controls are a bad interface
fluttercry; Mutterguy - in Japan, yes
indeed fluttercry~
What, you can't get your sword skills up?
slow unresponsive
Based on what, bug?
hang on, let me see if i can find the trailer
iv coded for the damn thing
Mirrorimage: not only in japan anymore, because WORLDWIDE RELEASE
In what game?
Butthatcould justne 12 angry men with loud music!
Nyria: i started on a chrome one, i'l try again. see if i cant make it work
its less baout actually using them
teehee!!!!
more pretending the user is doing what you want and blending it
fluttercry: I heard there's even a stage musical
I was able to master Zelda's motion controls.
Sorry on my I pad
wait...
In what game have you coded for the Wii motion plus?
Phase4: it' seems i don't know how to use it xD
about*
yeah, that's right
whats the point of a game if its playing for me
0,5============
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: see that muffin thats in your browser?
Phase4: Oh~! You don't have to, if you don't want to~ Though if you do I would love to download it and support it ^^
BEFORE I GET KICKED FOR THAT LINK - it is 100% clean, despite the link itself
In what game have you coded for the Wii Motion Plus?
*kssh* nom leader the books have arrived, over *kssh*
Eww, CoD...
Cake or Death
lol
not a full game, tech demos using a BT adapter
/me highhoofs Tovler for his mad Zelda skillz
Nyria: its not a problem, theres a few people with chrome that want it and its worthwhile to learn how to do it
What is BT?
plus is better yes, not good thoguh
bluetooth
hooked into my desktop
same as my kinnect
What does Bluetooth have to do with Wii Motion Plus?
Phase4: I can't wait to see it come out ^^
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: it sometimes defaults to the addon bar, press ctrl+/ to make it apear
Kinect works by taking pictures, not reading movement
so i can get the raw data off the wiimote and run on that
Davie_Jones - Wiimotes communicate with Bluetooth
Phase4: http://derpy.me/UNAdn oh right hadn't noticed it before
I don't get it
how does it work
Tell me bug, what was the highest ratio you got it to work at?
05,15troll napalm
0,5OBJECTION!
can't remember, was a while ago
Was it before Wii Motion plus?
OVERRULED
after, cause getting the drivers to actually give me the plus data was a pain
or is it take that?
/me noms Morty
yes?
Hold on...
:3
its mostly just a gyro anyway
So, you hacked your wii mote plus to make a game on your PC, right?
it tickles
/me noms on... unfoundbug
There be a Silly party going on in here and NO BODY PINGS ME?!
Shame on you
o.0
Don't eat bugs~
Hey all.
Hey Randomnerd~
well, there goes my train of thought
Before you did taht, did you actually... play the game?
Hihi Randomnerd~
Now then
bugs contain proteins
Skyward Sword, I mean.
Hi~ Randomnerd
/me eyes IRC.
hai randomnerd
But they're full of protein, like prawns and lobster
I find you lack of letters, disturbings
yes, gave it an hour really didnt grow on me at all
/me shakes with the rage of ten million baby kittens.
Did you fidn it responsive?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W8QGGtFdPU&feature=related Final Boss spoilers, but good god.
not when i wanted it to be
How so?
very obviously when the game wanted it it was
So once again. Where were we?
Is Skyword sword a good game?~
Ah yes, Sillyness!
Yes
um Ictiv: there is silliness in #twilight_sparkle
but i write the damn things, so i notice things like that way more than most will
:D
/me noms on Ictiv|Wizard's pointy hat
You write what?
games
And the chitin is a good source of fibre (citation needed)
You program games, you mean.
1,3I ate him
:O
Pointy? This? Since when are hare skin fedoras pointy?
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
1,3om nom nom
most people dont see the difference so i usually stick to write as it involves less explaining
0,5Guys
Or do you somehow presume that being a Wizard I have to look like a 13th century court jester?
So because your indie games require you to make games that 'want' to be played sometimes, you believe it is the same in this case?
*kssh*Nom Leader this is Book Fort, over *kssh* You have a go on tasty tagert , over *kssh*
For shame
GIMME BACK MY FRIEND!

I want games that react when i do something not when they expect me to do something
Have at you good sir!
0,5I have a poem for the game

skyward sword felt so artificial

NO
I"M GONNA GET YOU OUTTA THERE
This isn't right...
i enjoy more freedom and challenge
its okay
/me hands SB a Sili, he finished the y and half the l
I had a major Deja Vu.
Can I hear it LordCelestia?
Like?
you like being in a stomach?
0,5Sure
10,02:D
orly?
Oh no. It's happening again
with less of the controller helping and pulling the actual input to expected
kirzstryfe is my personal nommer
its his job, you see
0,5Roses are red, violets are blue. Ive lost the game, and now so have you.
Gosh darn it I'm doing the Time Warp again

that makes lots of sense
what's up
LordCelestia so ? http://i39.tinypic.com/ouqkpy.jpg
yeah, for example,i have and play CoD blackops on the PC and XBOX with my controller
Ha as soon as I read that I flew off the map on Rock Of Ages
well, yeah scratch out the personal part :$
he typically noms on me and SB though
Well
Superbrony64 is best pony
the PC version plays much better cause the aim isnt constantly dragged towards the nearest enemy
Warning SB64 has sccivated silly mode, prepare for nonsense and make it double
What does that have to do with the Wii?
<3
not much...you?
I think I'll need to get off for a while now. But I have a gift before I leave.
10,02Roses are grey, violets are grey, I'm a dog :|
yes, that is a problem with Console FPS and that is required.
nom nom nom
0,5Wiggle your rump
O U
0,5Oink oink oink
Woah~
on a break from playing skylanders
No one who professionally reviews and critics games care about that.
Davie, no it isnt
/me reaches up and removes first l from previous statment.
Take this SuperBrony64|Sili.
Totalbiscet said so himself.
The username "Nyria" was up for grabs and I got it~
It's for you
that's rare~
eeyup
Hm.
those who review games dont care bout gameplay at all anymore they want set pieces and graphics
/me removes y from "you".
This also.
10,02I'm best pony? :O
beautiful poem SB
yuss
hence why uncharted does so well though its a terrible game
Did you not say yourself that you thought Skyrim was pretty?
Then shout it out! Oink oink oink
yes
how far are you on it?
:)
but it has gameplay behind it
You are controdicting yourself
05,15But Uncharted isn't terrible
Actually...
You come pretty close
It isnt!
graphics help, though they shouldnt be the core
R63 SuperBrony64 is best pony
Yes, gameplay taht hasn't changed in years. Something you brought down on Zelda for doing.
10,02Which gameplay video are we watching right now?
/me noms the tail off SB's y
Well, you can't use game reviews as a soapbox for how horrible videogames have become.
yay puppies!
Looks like CoD to me.
SuperBrony64|Sili - read your PMs for heaven's sake. :P
You just can't beat dat look.
10,02DOGS COMING RIGHT FOR US
u sillyfilly
Woff woof~
Your prejury is becoming very clear.
well, I almost had the final boss battle the other night but my portal died and needed new batteries
/me prepares for the time warp.
Oh shiiiiiiii~
Well then.
and I only had 4 characters
Quick check list.
Head? Check.
I have no illusions, i am prejudice against alot of modern gaming trends
Rest of body? Check.
my mom surprised me with a few more last night though when she went to get the batteries so now I'm leveling and upgrading my new ones
then I'll do the battle
Dern achievements
Then you have no right to speak criticly about anything concerning modern gaming
Awesomeness? Check-o do sole mio baby!
regnerating health, auto-aim, and the general downward trend of any sort of player impact is a mssive loss
Oh dear, are we discussing the pros and cons of gaming reviews? Or merely the horror of the current direction of modern gaming?
Is there a stream going on right now?
Black Ops multiplayer on the wii? Now I've seen everything
Chaos is real tough
this game is so addicting, I didn't think it was gonna be but omg @___@;
I was able to beat him with just the starter characters :)
Staff of Greatness? *flips magic staff* Check.
I've yet to played any FPS this generation and kinda interested, even though I prefer RPGs
cool
I'd complain if I had some LEVERAGE over the gaming industry.
One thing left to do.
Dat Wario.
It used to be a Skyrim vs Skyward sword talk, but that broke down.
oh yeah, get rechargable batteries if you can
I see.
Well then.
See ya all sometime.
that way you wont get stuck
In mah day is was complete the game or chose your own arbitrary means to win
my mom got an 8 pack so I should be okay for awhile :)
cya boss
/me disappears.
It turned into a "I hate what Skyward Sword does, except when Skyrim does it."
/me hugs Ictive
Bye
The best FPS I've played would always be Half life~
true
half life was good
Amen, Nyria
drobot is my big weapon
Another EQD pony mission
The best FPS will always be Halo: CE before it was remade :3
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/01/reddit-and-imdb-pony-groups-seeking.html
just when we all agree...
You little kid
Didn't get past picking up the crowbar....
Counter strike~
halo is definately among the greats
hey be nice~ It's his opinion~
NO it isn't
And I like halo as well :3
It's a overhyped garbage game for fratbrothers
I totally see myself skipping console gaming all together.
The first Halo was ok
Oh no...
It was actually one of my first FPS games~
Can I make a request of the mods?
First Halo is best Halo imo
05,15The best FPS ever was Half-Life
^
agreed
End this discussion before it turns into an FPS flamewar? :P
mhm~
I liked Half life 2. The first one...
never played portal yet I love it
Agreed
portal was very good
^
^^^
Portal was great
Portal was great~
2 looked better in the previews
Perfect game.
<3 Potral
You can't beat duke nukes for cheap thrills though...
portal*
05,15Portal 2 has great writing
but they took out alot of the good stuff cause the playtesters found it hard
2 only looked bad because the first was Perfect.
Mutterguy: yes you can, portal is cheeper
/me has never played Poortal 2
I enjoyed looking for the white walls in Portal 2.
portal*
You should it's a great game~
* duke nukem 3d( the original one)
05,15yes!
I still play that game
Seriously though, I'm a halo fanboy :3
05,15It's time to kicks ass and chew bubble gum, and I'm all out of gum.
I need another current gen console
nothing ever quite matches skrinking an enemy and squashing them under your boot
/me gags
/me raises sheild
shrinking*
Talk about bad writting. And it got worse in Duke Nukem Forever.
time-splitters is the best console shooter ever
lol, it wasnt about the writing in that gae
game*
05,15Did anyone else every play Goldeneye on N64?
it was one liners and OTT bad guys
also interested in playing time splitters
YES!!!
They should make a mod that turned off Duke's Voice
Now that really was the best shooter ever made
It was oaky...
Yes, Goldeneye was always fun.
okay*
me and my friends only play multiplayer in goldeneye
Four player deathmatch with my brothers was awesome.
Davie at the time I don't think they were worried about the writing. It was a simple time
Glad we all grew up then
never touched singleplayer
Perfect Dark was also pretty good
I hate it when games are 100% different from the other console it was also made on~
I remember seeing a brother of a friend play Goldeneye when I was young
05,15But it was so good! And it's the whole reason Console shooters even exist
What is?
but it's so dated now though
<3 Ps2
kirzstryfe
What about it is dated?
I can't talk to him like this >_>
goldeneye
dafaq, i just started the stream
What about it?
goldeneye isnt dated in the least
?
pinkydash im working silly XD
I remember playing the old spongebob games~
Oh
on your
then again, it's been awile since I played it
yeah
i think i still got a rom backup so i could play it on my big screen
Origins, this ones quite fun
...Now THERES something I wanna play.
Heyo everypony! how goes it?

No. It's like.. every episode they touch turns into.... manure.
Oh~ well Scoot-Scootaloo if you want I'm on steam ^^

There's a bronystate group~

I can't play on this computer, since its a piece of crap laptop :/
Oh... aw~
Yes
Hey!
I was hoping all of us could play sometime~
i cant play this on my comp without a controller...
I have my 360, so I'm fine with that :3
I would love to see an episode where they don't carry the idoit ball in their skulls

i used to pay for xbox, then i took an arrow to the knee, it said "lol your paying to be advertised to", then i stopped paying
true story
05,15Hey buy this game, now pay to play it once a year.
Yeah, Live is pretty BS, but for some reason, I can't stop paying D:
/me is a corporate sheep
it is annoying to find it
You're under the spell of Microsoft, Scoots.
05,15oh so am I. I still use xbox
i think the last game i buy on xbox will be ME3, i want my saves to much to move to pc
i use xbox, when its connected... but im a pc and ps3 player mostly
I have a dumb laptop and a Mac. Macs are terrible gaming computers >: (
^
that sucks...
/me has never used a mac other than in school~
my condolences
And there not that good when it comes to flash~
lol, apple hated flash so much they pushed html5
cause they have more control over that
/me has only used macs outside of school. forlorn.
Macs have their uses sometimes, but I prefer to steer clear of them
My roomate is the only one who uses the one in our dorm
I've only used family member's Macbooks. But A LOT of people in school have them
/me used to use defult browser until 1 month ago~
default*
my uncle has a mac, he uses it for DJ-ing
dj ing?

he's a dj

Interesting.

thehated5689: you must be thinking of a different game

Darn it SB! y u no play 360 with me?!

/me 0,5pings FlutterBro13
0,5Hm
ah great, another SOPA-alike is pushing through
0,5WAT
Wat wat?
"ACTA"
you just now hearin about this?
0,5Oh
0,5Wow
That's international.
0,5REALLY
0,5You JUST heard about this?
0,5-_-
Hey~ not his fault~
ACTA? the bill USA signed in October?
That's the problem, they try to keep it under wraps.
inb4 slowbro(?) nah just kidding but really it's been out for a while now :p
who posted 'go the distance'?
Ah no, just got a notification in my email thats a fair bit dated
0,5Sorry, its just, Bronystate has been advertising it for a while now.
me
http://i.imgur.com/y0J6w.jpg
0,5SAY NO TO ACTA
Too late.
0,5Its worse than SOPA
GabeMoist: you posted go the distance
What do you think we have Freakshows like the Kardashians?!
?
0,5Its not too late...
Why*
Virtually every first-world nation has already signed it. >_>
lol, we were telling people to ST_U about SOPA/PIPA in October.
0,5It wont be too late until like June of this year.
0,5But the more we act.
I posted it as in posted in this chat
0,5We better well do.
The EU, for the most part, signed it about a week or two ago.
meow
05,15booo
gabe.. i cant tab complete your name for some reason
haha EspyLacopa~
The US signed it in October along with Canada and a few others.
It's definitely worse than SOPA, because it's got more signatories. SOPA was unenforcable.
/me thinks Fallout New Vegas is scary
What are you doing to my name?
<3 Fallout: NV
There's little left to fight it with, when almost everyone has already signed onto it.
You should play Amnesia
GabeMoist: thanks for posting that, neat music
mew
Amnesia: Dark Descent
05,15Question, should I buy Counter Strike or Counter Strike Source.
signed != law
This isn't like SOPA where the bill hadn't even reached the point at which it COULD be approved. ACTA already HAS been.
/me pets IshBestKitty~
Hey there~
05justine beats dark descent
CS:S will have more players
hmmm
I thought it was awesome, so I thought you guys might want to hear it
/me prrs and rubs against Nyria
Haaaaaiii
CounterStrike Source
Hawaii
It's not a law, NullRadix, it's a trade agreement.
Oh Wreky~ I thought you where getting some sleep~
my chat is atempting suicide, brb
/me played Amnesia. Nightmares were recurring and paronia attacks were had....
05as did I
Crap. Too late.
And its effects are technically supposed to be in place already.
its ok
I'm sad that Megaupload is guilty until proven innocent.
Ohai IshBestKitty
anyone seen that moviebob episode about sopa?
: (
as I recall, there was something about the individual countries still having to agree with it, like Congress haven't to approve the president's signature
they were already proved guilty
/me purrs and rubs against LadyCanary
there we go
ohai NullRadix
/me pets the kitty
hm?
They just haven't set up the infrastructure for it yet, as I recall.
13nya?
evening Phase4
internal emails were seized which showed them knowing about illegal content and using it for personal gai
NullRadix: Most of the EU signed it less than two weeks ago.
n
/me brohoofs Phase4 for movie
/me brohoof's Flaria
Flaria~!
ah thanks, it got left in the message window, that 'n' was lonely
who is the man on the stream, btw?
I don't remember.
If all MegaUpload files are deleted, how will they prove that MU was largely used for legal stuff.
/me hugs Flaria~
And the only way that Congress can override the president's vote, as far as the US goes, is for them to find a way to legally declare ACTA as a treaty.
/me hugs Nyria~
problem with ACTA: it is IMPOSIBLE to impliment the level of regulation the bill calls for
Have you tried Google Talk before?
as in imposible, cannot be done
But it's not, not really. It's a trade agreement, and Congress has no say in the president's ability to sign trade agreements, technically.
Trapped forever! ACTA! ACTA!
there is way to much bandwidth to filter
I'm no law expert, but again from what I've been hearing is that while the countries signed it, it still hasn't been through proper legal processes at 'home' for respective values of home... I could be wrong
nope never
Here's the basics:
I'm gonna sing the doom song, doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom
^
thats the basics?
Congress can't do squat about it unless one of two things can be proven:
Gir is so adorable~
A friend from Xbox and I are using it to make a Minecraft commentary. Since Google Talk is VoIP, we can live chat while recording our voice and game.
1) That ACTA enforces new laws on the United States (which hasn't been, and indeed cannot be, concretely proven from a legal standpoint at this time)
you play together?
2) That ACTA serves the function of a treaty, thereby falling under Congress's duties as part of their ability to regulate commerce.
Neither of these are actually options, and neither is a priority since all eyes have been turned to the presidental primaries.
On a server. Do you play the game?
Senate votes on Treaties
Yes. But it's not a treaty, that's my point.
0,5I know what will happen
0,5If it does pass,
doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom
bacon
Congress would have to prove that it IS a treaty, and they can't. Because it's not.
^
0,5ACTA passes. Riots. Hacking. Illegal actions. Rebellion. Lives ruined. Massive lawsuit. The people will win.
nope
0,5So dont worry.
If it passes, we overthrow the government and declare LordCelestia as world ruler
"passes"
It's not a law
xD
0,5Oh well
05,15Anarchy in Bronystate! *throws fire bomb*
0,5You know what I mean
GabeMoist and I will challenge that title
It's a trade agreement and it's already taken effect technically.
I would like to see an up rise~
/me 13is set on fire .-.
0,5NO
Im worried about what will be tantamant to a digital war between governemnts and hackers
Well, at this point, I'm expecting it's more likely someone will make their own internet.
I'd kill to be able to vote "no confidence" on the ballot.
no I dont
Hmm. I wonder if Google Talk does three way calls.
/me douses Shizuka with a bucket of water
/me 0,5douses Shizuka with a bucket of water
It's just that the infrastructure demanded by ACTA has not actually been put in place yet.
omg again
So it is binding for all of the people who have signed, but cannot yet be enforced.
0,5Oh well
/me played this game and regretted it
05,15well that was a short lived riot
<GabeMoist> If it passes, we overthrow the government and declare LordCelestia as world ruler <-- free trips to the moon for everyone!
0,5With no internet, lives will be ruined. That calls for lawsuits in some cases.
/me 13is now wet .-.
Seriously, a bunch of guys back in the 70s made the Internet for the DoD, it'd probably be easier to do now since there are more programmers.
0,5Especially if suicide / crimes occur
/me watches as Occupy fizzles out.

The problem is that if you look at the underlying principles of this rot, it seems as if even Libraries would need to be shut down.

I think fillies shouldn't play with fire...
0,5FIYAH

Eh, to be fair, a lot of this has been overblown.

yo dawg, i heard u like fire, so i put some fire on the fire
/me loves how Dan from Dan Vs tries to set everything on fire.
...Fire bad! fire bad!
bet dash could put it out though
SOPA and PIPA and now ACTA are being made into boogeymen that will come into your house and steal your unborn children, rather than just a desperate act by a dying collective of dinosaur industries that want to stay relevant.
...Fire good! fire good!
I remember burning my hand a lot when I was little~
/me hugs thehated5689
Long time no see.

Too the MOOOOON with fire
It would be far easier to just boycott the ever-living hell out of those groups.
Fire cleanses your pores
/me hugs flaria
heyo again!
unfoundbug great job, now even the moon's on fire
The idea that a company should be able to get a government to do the hard work for them is pretty reprehensible.
D: Nuuuuuu
theres no air on the moon for a fire to survive
There's oxygen on the moon o.o
yes
unfondbug its magic fire, it needs no oxygen
Randomnerd: Hi, let's meet capitalism
dat game was so addicting
fine ill find magic water
unfoundbug quit interfering with the fire
Ah yes, capitalist. The wonderful system by which the richest corporations petition the government to get special benefits that allow them to kill their competition!
at least only burn SOPA/PIPA supporters
I feel that history repeats itself so many times~
Sort of like exactly how SOPA was intended to work!
CrtiicKitten I'm not disagreeing with you.
You want to get rid of corporate interference? You need to get rid of capitalism. Not half-heartedly either.
*Entirely*.
I'm gonna sing the doom song, doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom
Well that's it for me I'm going to sleep~
It's the RIAA and such today, it'll be other corporations tomorrow. :P
Goodnight everybody~
G'night Nyria!

Well, there's going to be corruption in any system, but capitalism is the only system I've seen where it's actually rewarded.

Liberal is a bad word?
socialism has never actually been implemented
Well, any system that uses taxes for government services is "socialized"
/me cough*overthrow congress*cough
Eh, it was more McCarthy and the Red Scare, to be fair
The Army uses tax money to provide a service that no private agency could provide
/me cough*new world order*cough
05,15Well yeah, and now socialism is always thought to be the stepping stone to communism. IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT
10,02What does PTFO stand for?
/me wonders how the world didn't go into an economic meltdown after Europe was destroyed in WWII.
Eeyup
SuperBrony64|Sili Party the F:Ok On?
also, was mostly france
10,02Oh...is Wrek mad?
who got the money from the germans
Comprehensive conspiracies don't work in the end. Event conspiracies are possible, if improbable. How does the NWO work? If the participants are really that vicious, wouldn't they just murder one another?
Wrek should be asleep
Randomnerd: you could go with the FO Raiders theory: Like likes like
06.-.
cough*viva la revolution*cough
Much like the theory of Tyrant Celestia, to bring back ponies...
05,15I don't think revolt is necessary.
I'll wait for the next global economic meltdown before I make a move.
fluttercry that won't keep it from happening
/me hands ishbestpony a cough drop "are you sick or something?"
/me 13curls up with vivi by the fireplace~
Celestia didn't send Luna to the moon because she was jealous of her power, she sent her to the moon because authority figures fuck up.
05,15The government just needs to hit the reset button.
Revolution could have worked back when citizens had roughly the same weapons as soldiers and the lines between them were blurred. Nowadays standard riot police could end a revolt, much less our military. Of course that assumes revolt is even ideal. :p
/me darts around at mention of fire
Looking for the easiest way to solve a problem, she did something horrible.

In the US, all that one party has to do is be less disgusting than the other.

What's new with you?

What is this madness?

At the moment in the UK we hve a coalition, and i think its the best iv seen, they actually have to work together to get stuff done

Hello everyone : 3
Oh, oh! Pick me! I have a plan! It's called "force government to become a public service as it was intended to be". Pay them a pittance of what they get now, set hard caps on advertisement and spending, kill off the Super-PAC system....

It'd have to be a much shorter term.
Or far less demanding.
Because it costs millions to run.

8,1no telescope, just a kit lens
...Wow.
my god, its full of stars
But a middle-class ciitzen still needs a *job*
very nice
That's absolutely beautiful.
They have staff who read the bills they vote on FOR THEM, how much actual work do you think they do anymore?
I have some pics of stars
i never see stars here
8,1Phase4: no telescope
You're missing out meh.
i know
can't we all live in a peacefull society, like the smurfs, or the ponies
Congress requires constant campaigning as it is.
good raw material
8,1<3
IshBestPony that would be asking too much.
/me grows a Stalin moustache in protest.
No it doesn't.
They've just MADE it that way.
It always took campaignig, it just had a smaller pool of voters.
Is it SFW?!
Running for president does not require that the campaign start 2 years into the existing guy's term. >_>
13oh dear
8,1teehee
Pols also used to not campaign on their own.
13he gon beat you
good ogd
1,3lol
It could easily be done in a much shorter span, but no one wants to do that because they like to drag it all out.
Beating is an understatement
that guy to the right of the doctors head looks like a creeper
It makes them money.
Parties would disseminate speeches that were delivered by local agents of the party.

But I'd be sent a speech, and I'd be told to deliver it on his behalf.
/me hugs Phase4 and unfoundbug and thehated5689 and SkilledSkillet and Everlasting_Joy and Roxsnow and Randomnerd
yay
Hugs IshBestPony and watches him/her depart.
This worked at the time because there was no effective means of the candidate reaching the masses on their own.

When a congressman only has to talk to a group of a few hundred white males, he can get them all in a few big meetings in a few weeks.
Our voting pool is much bigger, now.
This is good, but it makes that sort of thing impractical.
alternative vote?
And yet we purposefully drag out the campaign term MUCH longer than necessary.
Hai
The population is larger but the technology is also VASTLY improved.
hola sparktech
Hi SparkTech
heyo SparkTech
Well, the presidential Campaign is literally longer.
dken2021 >_>
*Shudders* I really shouldn't be reading Creepypasta at 9 aclock..But oh well...
Iowa and NH used to be held in March.
Hell, I remember when I was a boy it was held in March.
Congressmen used to campaign more, and the legislative season was shorter.
Well, I misspoke. The Legislative season was shorter, but Congressmen campaigned much differently than they do now.
Retail politics were the only method.
And the Presidential candidates didn't go out and do retail politics on their own.
As I said, local party operatives did the legwork.
There's no easy answer, per se, but with a parliamentary-style voting process, we could at least stop voting for the lesser of two evils.
hello
im back all
8,1GabeMoist: i just pointed my camera up to a patch of sky that wasn't cloudy

hi everyone
Everlasting_Joy: I wonder what's for dinner.
welcome back
8,1but that was on a moderately bad night for seeing, bit of cloud up, and with a 300mm focal length
hey fillyfillyy
hey MahBoi777
Is it a large of small part of the sky?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJjvV0t_3Qw best vocals ever.
8,1i think i could have gotten a much better pic with a shorter focal length and some better caera settings
8,1and better sky conditions
Perhaps the thing that disgusts me most about corruption is that US politicians sell out for so little.
I've taken some pictures of the sky. pictures of the sky are cool
Randomnerd, you act like human depravity has a limit. That's all I'm going to say.
money, it's all about the money
In some countries, a bribe comes with the implicit threat of murder for non-compliance. Yet still some people refuse.
should i color my Pinkie Pie picture?
the love of money is the root of all evil
8,1fillyfillyy: do it, filly!
and yet, we vote for them anyway while merely shaking our head at people who don't vote.
fillyfillyy you should show us it.
well take a look http://derpy.me/5jaNE i think it would ruin it
do it filly
Well, if you don't vote, they won't listen.
Well, if Pink Floyd says that money is the root of all evil, MahBoi777, then it must be true.
Randomnerd - SOPA.
If you vote and they ignore you, it's a tragedy.
http://img269.imageshack.us/img269/8608/orion6small.jpg
fillyfilly color it.
If you say "they don't care" and not vote, they will do as they please.
it's not about "voting," it's about shouting with a loud enough voice
I vote and shout.
unfortunately, democracy tames most shouts
so MahBoi777 and Everlastin_Joy should i color it.. after you saw it
hence: Occupy, Anonymous, etc
GabeMoist where wa that light coming from?
Well See ya later everyone~, i'm going to read for a while, Goonight~

ohai Kirzstryfe
And every poltiical hiccup I've seen in the last few years in this country is basically a result of a COMPLETE loss of perspective.
it'll look gud, well it already looks good, so maybe better is what I'm trying to say
8,1your sensor's being saturated, though; if you use a smaller iso, and less exposure time, you can capture star colours better. if you want fainter objects, you can also take many photos and stack them (brighter objects won't be as white and you'll have less sensor noise)
im gonna trace it but i gtg shower 1st ill be back soon
8,1(note, the stacking method is not what i used on my photo)
See you soon fillyfilly *hugs.
alright filly

Pick somepony else
I said someone else did
2 instruments at the same time?
i think is the wii version
definately not the pc in any case
Well do you know somepony who does?
oh it is? thot there was a pc version
8,1i'm guessing it was with a bloody good refractor
But it is of the same constellation
pc looks SOO much better
Nope
Pick somepony else
Battlefield ftw
God, I've probably been put on ignore by half the room... sorry, I'm very pedantic.
Well lotta help this turned out to be
Sorry :(

Anyway, ponies.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvr09PCWuuk easily the best song in Skyward Sword.
I like 'em. A lot.
lol
Ime too!
Randomnerd we all do :).
me too
how wierd
mmmm, yes quite
I have a calendar counting down the days to BronyCon.
youd think this was a pony chat room or somthing
The image is a mosaic the guy did. He used several hours of exposure time
So who is best pony?
It is a pony calendar.
rather than a political discussion
GIMME THE NEW EPISODE AND HAVE DERPY IN IT,DAMMIT!!!
hello
All pony is best pony.
Pinkie Pie!
luna
Those ponies have huge foreheads
1,3lol, ask a random question if someone knows latin and get huffy when nobody does
Pretty much every image the guy does turns out amazing
/me climbs into Ari's lap and growls softly
1,3watch the allcaps please
stinkomanfan!
Moosic~
SlurryMoon
Tophat!
wahahahahahario!
<3
sorry
I want to make a Space Marine Chapter for Warhammer 40K that loves ponies.
:)
hello
I honestly cant decide :/.
They'd be heretics.
Because ponies are xenos
SlurryMoon
LunaTheBeloved hi im new kinda idrk u
Give them all cutie marks on their pauldrons.
Suffer not the xeno to live, etc.
i like caps <3
but hi
I guess I have to say RD lol
Hi Morty!
:3
This is wrong. . .
I'm LunaTheBeloved
Boss tiem
omg wario
They believe The Emprah rides Celestia into Battle.
Most people call me LTB though
Hey, if the Imperium can put up with Space Wolves...
who's da emprah?
hi LTB! yay new friends
When did you start coming here?
3Hai Morty!
hi silly
sillymoon
3It's always nice to see new users
bad inside joke... in 40K, the God-Emporer of Mankind is the ruler of humans.
is everybody seeing what im seeing O_O
Emperor*
30 more minutes until I can sleep
im def gonna be a regular
ok all im back and now im gonna copy down my picture to color it
i love the brony community
That's good
3:3 yay~
yea man, too much all caps equals kick
SlurryMoon
Yay~
when I came here in the summer, I didn't make friends with anypony
3x3
But because the VAs in the Video Games put on horrible accents, they say "Emprah"
I always wondered, why are there so little male ponies O.o
hello again everyone
I just lurked
I slowly gained friends
hello Gibby
The other towns have lots of Male Ponies
3TopHat I was the same as you, but look at me now
hey gibby
wario is now 20% cooler
haha ya
lol
Flim and Flam made up for the lack of male representation.
FOR THE EMPRAH!
And where's the Queen?
I'll never be a mod though
You never know
If there was a Princess
never say never
3It's a fun job if you have the time
but I don't want the responsibility
except when you say "never say never"
Who would the King be?
When I used to run with the "Tyrant Celestia" trolls I'd say the Males are fighting wars of conquest, lol.
then u can say it twice :P
but to get from princess to queen, she would have to marry a prince
1,3yeah, we feed him, and water him, and let him out to play 3 times a day
simple, queen = evil, princess = good
is it RD playin this?!
I rather like being a resident
ohai filly
i dont think anypony s good enough for celstia
Randomnerd: omg that makes so mcuh sence
wtf
i have tons of time on my hands, doing nothing until september
I just
infoundbug, or lives long enough
>mfw I think of Trolestia/Molestia before I think of canon Princess Celestia
I feel sad.
I don't know why. I just do.
3Well, maybe you should try to be a mod when we start accepting applications again
Something on your mind?
cept hanging here, being with gf and writing
ok maybe ^-^
That would make the most sence too, and Celestia is keeping the rest of the population ignorant of the ongoing wars
1984 all over again.
There's little implication there's a war on in Equestria. It could also be universal male Conscription.
/me huggles LadyCanary
/me hugs Flaria back
do you get payed? lol
Back in my days as a young resident.....
Something on my mind?
Well, there's quite a lot.
am i the only person who wants saturday to come
it could just be genetically males are less viable than females
But this isn't my blog. So I'll spare you my woes.
Basically, the fellas are watching the border.
Maybe the males all died in the war
then why wasnt macintosh there
1,3lol, paid
1,3nope
maybe he was too young for war?
Paid. That's a good on---Wait do you?
Maybe he finished his tour.
good lol
Draft dodger
Macintosh suffers from PTSD, and doesn't talk a whole lot because of it.
explain why theres so many young fillies
3No, no, you don't get paid
Hurr hurr.
or inb4 it's a show about silly ponies, no need to go deeper than that
This is all headcanon, mind.
eeeyup
3That is unless you guys donate to us
I like being a resident
1,3not that Slurry knows at least :3
Hey
half the fun is making up backstory though
i wanna donate!
Hey, BronyCon
Hey

Does anyone here recomend Hawx 1?
3Suddenly Luna
To a girl named Juliet....
rayman
World-building is fun, but to be honest, the "Conscription" Theory isn't internally consistent.
Suddenly rare names
1,3hehe
BronyCon - you mean the fighter jets game?
I got it on xbox, i really enjoyed Hawx
yes
We know what Pony War looks like -they shoot pies.
it's alright
Um
There it will be used to further the Brony Communtiy
Pc?
put black ops on):
as long as you get custom soundtracks going
1,3the 6 rooms are just different chat channels, there's only one stream
i had it for PS3
hi Luna
Hawx 1?
07,01hello
just be sure to have flight of the valkyries ready to play nduring the dogfights
yeah
1,3I think it's running on autopilot atm, nobody's actually playing
:>
Ohai Lulu
lol unfound
/me noms on zapapple
the bombing runs are a bit dull
Yeah
Mr. and Mrs. Cake are defense contractors, if "Over a Barrel" is any indication.
but if you ignore the auto targeting and dog fight in jets
Hahaha
its REALLY fun
07,01hello everypony
i was jokin
Randomnerd - how do you gather that from Over a Barrel?
Quick Question Lulu......everytime somepony says my name, do you get pinged?
How's the cockpit and controls?
1,3:p
Ponies fight Buffalo with Pie.
only played xbox
but felt pretty solid
07,01not in mIRC but yea if i'm logged in via the web...I get pinged
ah
maybe their "catering" business is secretly a ammunition store
ok
thanks
not if they type your whole name
was raqyman humpin the air?
Oh......
I'm back!
Get Ace Combat Assault Horizon, that's my only suggestion.
YAAAY
what's up my bronies?
the camera was pretty nice as well, multiple modes was cool
hiyo otakon
buffalo? with pie?!
nm, good to see ya, otakon
I'm sorry if that gets annoying....
Howdy otakon|AFK.
Luna was banished to the Moon for opposing the war efforts
otakon: wuz up?
Stay tuned! Coming up next Sonic Generations!
not much
:P6_9
1,3very few people type out LunaTheBeloved
3The pings have been Doubled!
I like that jingle
Actually, I find it more dreadful to think that Celestia made a horrible mistake.
07,01it's alright
/me dreams Equestria
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu.
...
Luna wouldn't have gotten out if it weren't for her escape effort
ck
RayMan?
type out?
Not that she was oppressing ponies, and banished Luna for her defiance.
what about tab
If you'ld like me to change my name I will.
Dude, I love Rayman
/me glomps LunaTheBeloved
You did have the name first
/me is glomped
Hi there :3
1,3we tried that out before LunaTheBeloved, you were unhappy for a week before you changed back
/me has a new irl friend
But that Luna did a bad thing, and in her inexperience and anger, Celestia Banished her own Flesh-and-Blood to the moon... because even grown-ups make mistakes kids.
3Oh LunaTheBeloved, you don't have to do that
how come were the only ones talkin
Phase4 if only some of us were so lucky ;).
Randomnerd - it was Time Out, plain and simple
1000 time out
just a matter of scale
I used to have real-life friends, like you.
If it annoys her I can, I really don't mind
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSS SONIC!!!!!!
Everyone else is probably in BronyState...
:)
then you took a pony to the mind?
hahaha
god that music
Then I took a fluttershy to the d'awww
Everlasting_Joy: well to be fair i was more or less forced to talk to him
Or to the SQUEE.
that's a better one
Phase4 fair enough.
hiya LadyCanary
Took a squee to the knee

Ohai otakon.

Then I took a pony to the squee.

07,01you know I like you

KetaminaDianePie: why the :(
KetaminaDianePie: why are you crying/
MirrorImage: Eeyup
i think the embarrasment in that scene was less "i'm naked. oh wait" as much as it was "why am i covering up in the first place?"
1yay black ops 2.no all caps
hmm
maybe
yay, TopHat left a comment
I did?
kind of like letting Spike in while they're changing

ok i have a copy of my first Pinkie Pie drwing so im going to color the copy...what should i use crayons colord pencils or markers

/me hugs LunaTheBeloved
"We don't normally wear clothes..."

Finish it Tovler!
hi =]
otakon: I can't help it. It's one of my favorite tumblr
and the alleged "covering up" she did afterwards was just her in that frozen moment of shock; her hooves were just holding up the blanket
07,01eeeyup

HEEEEEY!
Dashie has she joined the herd?

GarrettBrony: we need a streamer

/me squees
Ohai LadyCanary
/me hugs Flaria

Hey. :>
I need one of Sumica's patented anime movies.
Hai~
i want to be a streamer
Well that's gonig to have to change one day.
Nope otakon, English. :P
i want to be a tree
WERE IS sumica
lol this is my first time streamin :'(
Man, that was one of the best episodes of Adventure Time ever.
1,3but if you play House, it's almost to the kutner/bad episode isn't it?
"I'm the world champ, you know. I bet you can't beat me! *SQUEE*...Aaahhhhhh...."
I hax ALL his things
Yeah?
07,01yep
isn't there a part of England called Wales?
Nope.
Sumica's still rubbing elbows with the high-rollers
:(
Wales is a different country.
:P
07,01should try to stream at least 1 or maybe 2 eps tomorrow
:/
Wales and Eng… yeah
Duh
@otakon, be VERy careful where you say that
You didnt know that?
:P
RainbowDash be sad no longer, I bet thee.
I did
You would get raged at by Welsh people for saying.
I was just messin
And raged at by English people.
:P
alot of people in both countries dont like being associated with theother
*I beseech thee.
Just generally raged at
ooooh
welsh? i;ma google that
Everlasting_Joy: :P
raged at by the english
It's like calling a Texan a yankee. You just don't do that.
Welsh is for grape juice?
scary~
Nope
whois
a general rule of thumb, everyone hates everyone unless there is someone that lives further away
how 6_9
RainbowDash why I went with a middle English line? Because sometimes I do.
Its like using the term British, it refers to Engalnd, Wales, and Scottland
or a brony
Or like calling a souther italian terrone
haha:D!
no one's streaming, it's on loop
noooooooooo
Just as Andy Murray is British if he wins, and Scottish if he loses.
Just recently he was Scottish.
XD
It's okay. My mom goes to alot of Renaissance fairs so she speaks that way smoetimes. Thank Thee...

I love how the Bristish destroy their dogs instead of putting them down.

i was talking about the link
the 6 message/10 seconds kick script
It doesn't need fixing
13it does its job well
I think it does
either that message is horribly inaccurate or your criteria is off
1,3non-pony stuff
KetaminaDianePie: oh, it does a 302 or 303 (not sure which) when you go to it
KetaminaDianePie: redirects you to another page
btw what game is this6_9
It's because of lag between me and the person sending the message.
10 seconds is awefully long with you think about it.
I got to get to bed now, guys. sry i was only here for a short time. I'll be on here tomorrow..BYE!:)
And either way, it works fine.

MirrorImage: You're wrong there
When we were singing along to Megas XLR, I got kicked, I'm not mad, I'm actually proud I could type that fast, lol.
I need to figure out how to use auto join script
so you can troll with images or videos and nobody knows Phase4?

I've been much more careful since then.
13well you won't without a real client otakun~

Tovler: don't be afraid
well crap
KetaminaDianePie: its intended for shorting urls, but i supose you can
I can safely say that Giant Rad Scorpions are the scariest jerks in Fallout. Serioulsy, screw those guys
"Connection reset by peer" doesn't mean a client quit.

oh, I thought that was it's main purpose

Well howdy Scoot-Scootaloo.

Seriously though, I don't think I'll sleep tonight...
And I come back, there has not been a chat msg for over 10 minutes
y?
I type a command, such as .join or .identify
err
/join or /identify
(OMG, this movie is boring! I h8 black history month!)
lol, dat season 2
13saxy~
07,01Wat
indeed
/me huggles SaxyPretender
ohai SaxyPretender
And it disconnects me and the status says "softweare caused connection abort"
0,14oh hai everyone
13so that happened
Those Giant Rad Scorpions scared the hell out of me!
hiya SaxyPretender!
/me hugs Flaria back
Scoot-Scootaloo: in what?
But another network I'm on works fine.
Tovler what cha watching?
07,01suddenly Shizu!
Ohai Saxy
0,14So guess what I got?
13where?
Fallout New Vegas
SaxyPretender! I KNOW I KNOW!
13>> <<
Scoot-Scootaloo - just wait until you start finding the booby trapped houses
A new computer Saxy!
that's weird
An Elephent!!
food?
It is.
07,01invisible!
a pony?
0,14not yet, Scoot-Scootaloo
SaxyPretender: A neeeeeew car~!
Dken2021: The Spook Who Sat by the Door

0,14but I got...
0,14SOUL
0,14CALIBUR
A Sammich!
0,14V
1,3yeah, that happened
:O
SaxyPretender: /)
Poor Fluttershy:(
Oh....
0,14(\ Flaria
you'll be walking along, and all of a sudden you'll take a random Varmint Rifle to the face
MirrorImages D:
I take it you're enjoying it, Saxy
All right
0,14eeyup
It happens so often that when it does reconnect, I forget to identify, thus the need for typing /identify
SOUL CALIBUR?!?!?!
I see two "connection reset by peer" quits
11,01K
I get scared so easily :(
0,14dat...dari bot
That must be it.
worse yet are the raiders who use Grenade Rifles as a primary weapon...
That is not on our end.
It happens at least once daily.
1,3so how long do you think we can slack off in here before anypony notices we're here?
What is it?
0,14a long time
0,14?
I just fought one! They came up to me from behind!
though if you encounter them in the right way, they can also be hilarious
13foreverr
/me wubs Scoot-Scootaloo
i saw one blow himself and 3 of his comrades up as i went to charge them with a combat knife
ok, an odd movie synopsis
"Hey buddy, can I get some wa-NADE LAUNCHER TO THE FACE!'
the grenade didn't even explode near me
0,14Forever's a long time
There is not enough Fluttershy!
omg i totally forgot about Soul Calibur V
0,14it's like...forever, man
And this chat room dies..........
The socket is being ungracefully closed somewhere on your end. Either your client is closing it without sending a QUIT command or something else is closing it for some reason.
Like I said, another network I'm on in the same mIRC at the same time dows not do that
and as another tip Scoot-Scootaloo - you'll want to become VERY good at Caravan
yeah
does*
1,3duuuuuude
another Soul Caliber
/me defribulates the chat
No streams?
Nope
I wonder if Namco still has busoms on the brain...
07,01nope
damnit, i keep loosing this tab
/me hugs everypony
I see tons of ping timeouts over the last few days.
11,013 nights. Coming in with no stream.
yay
/me hugs back
i ended up walking in to the Nipton store with about 2500 caps and managed to walk out with a Chainsaw (2700 caps), a damage mod for it (2500 caps), and a further 6000 caps in spare change
0,14they do, but nowhere near as bad as SC4
You know, I never really knew how to play Caravan. I still don't get it!
Nittany_Discord: well your a MOD you can change that!
I know I do
but I blame my ed
07,01Sorry was playing with Lanie :)
/me noms on defribulated chat
/me explodes into confetti
That is quite odd... I don't NOTICE pinging out ever.
he's just a hop
That means our server is sending your client a PING command and it is not replying within 250 seconds.
in my fanfic, should fluttershy say noooo or nyuuuuu
A skip!
I see about 15 per day for you
otakon thankyou for the suggestion
want me to give you a quick primer on it scoot?
You have a large ping timeout time
Who?
11,01I'm a half-op. I don't have the reigns of the main stream yet.
well...... at least is a new fighting game to play with my friends otakon
AppleDash
/me watches a pony noms, one explodes and another hugs
Ahhhh
1,3depends on the situation
13reins
I thought you meant me
D:
*nom
My other server only does about 25 seconds before timeout
You weren't asking for help. :-\
11,01I know.
Twilight is grabbing her to teleport
oops
Of course im not
wrong windows
SaxyPretender: tbh I don't mind cheesecake. But it did seem like all the females had a ....well "bountiful" set of endowments
13also today you learned it's "free rein" not "free reign" cause reign implies you can already do whatever you want
to a pony that hit on her
/me noms LunaTheBeloved while hugging her, then promptly explodes
DAMNIT i lost it again
Anyway, it looks like your client is not correctly answering pings. That is probably the main problem.
you lost
the game?
0,14indeed, otakon, I often joked that plastic surgery existed in the 16th century
whose up for cider
NO, this tab
lol
but that too
11,01it is reins
What could be causing that on my end?
/me is hugged,nommed then blasted with confetti into the wall
1,3in the story, is she really not interested, or feigning disinterest because of her personality?
Giggle at the Scorpions! Guffaw at the Ant-ies!
Ouch
to everyone who wanted me to color my Pinkie Pie picture http://derpy.me/e3xxH
11,01That's what I get for napping. Getting stupid.
/me hugs LunaTheBeloved x3
I'm not seeing frequent timeouts from other users, so I don't think it is server-side (and our automatic diagnostics would have reported this)
1,3<3
/me hugs SlurryMoon
so many derpy.me links
Crack up at the *WARGHL-GHOUL*
fillyfillyy: next time dear, use a smooth surface
Client misconfiguration, firewalls, ISP trouble, bad network hardware
(btw, have fun with the Ghouls - they like to ambush)
Misconfiguration is most likely
yeah
lol i know i dont have one :D
/me promptly noms kirzstryfe's tail in respnose
fillyfillyy: you don't have a smooth table or floor to use?
/me puts giraffes in the air
Fellow bronys look up the song Party by boston/ It is a great song for a pinkie pmv
I've used mIRC for 5 years and know quite a bit... But, for the fun of it, what could be misconfigured?
A cheap fix to this is normally to have your client send server pings every now and then. Most can be configured to do that.
I haven't gotten up to the part where I fight ghouls, and I'm scared D:
Kirzstryfe: She just kinda fainted of embarrassment after he sweet talked her
not in my room right now my desk is all scratched up
Scoot-Scootaloo: don't be, there's WORSE!
she is indifferent/embarrased
fillyfillyy: hmmm
use a textbook
Scoot-Scootaloo: Has Pinkie Pie taught you NOTHING?
1,3do you plan on her getting involved with said pony?
ok
no
but how is it?
I played Fallout 3, so i knda know what to expect, I hope D:
he has a gf!
Scoot-Scootaloo: wait until you meet the Deathclaws
?
1,3then I'd go with a regular noooooooo
deathclaws are awful otakon
I fought a young Deathclaw! It destrolished me!
otakon - why wait? just take the shortcut north to New Vegas from Goodsprings
that was my gut feeling
1,3nyuuuu sounds more like she'd want to go, but felt she had to fight it
And how do I do that? I've never heard of that option in mIRC
what are we talking about anyway
but Fluttershy saying nyuuuu=me want :3
it's completely plausible to defeat Deathclaws at level 3
Pinkie Pie never saw a giant Scorpion!
Scoot-Scootaloo when you meet the Deathclaws you can kill them and make a deathclaw guantlet
1,3Morty's writing a story
fillyfillyy: yeah, just but the textbook under the part your coloring is all, and don't forget it helps to color in the same direction, helps it look uniform
oh
he knows
GarrettBrony: yeah, but you need the blueprints first
0,14Deathclaw? Sounds like a good name for a metal band
Is it like a Freddy Krueger Gauntlet?
I hate blind deathclaws!
he's read the prologue
Scoot-Scootaloo: eeyup
damn you LordCelestia, now i have ANOTHER fanfick in my backlog
fanfic'
but Deathclaws are NASTEE!
%SaxyPretender when did you become a streamer
which btw is on fimfiction if anypony wants to read
insanely fast, lots of health and they do HUGE damage
0,14not a streamer, but a mod
What's the name?
the best bet is to have a high sneak
shadows of the moon
Shadows of the Moon
when didyou become a mod
I shall check it out
otakon - or a Grenade Rifle and lots of VATS
and take them out with sneak shots with a high power weapon to the head or legs
:P im new to actually trying to make pictuers look half decent even i tried really hard on thee original though... but other than the little problem what do you think of a ll three pictures?
cue up 4 shots to their torso and watch the gibs
I'm also playing on Hardcore, and let me tell you something... ITS HARD
MirrorImage: hell, the right melee build can wreck em
I could see this movie getting remade.
the prologue just introduces some OCs and sets a scene
FOSO
3hmm... nice title
0,14as for when I became a mod, about...2 and half weeks ago?
by tyler perry?
Scoot-Scootaloo: thus, HARDCORE! just play to the end of the main quest for the achievement
1,3that's the one you linked in chat a day or so ago right?
cool
well like i said, i walked out of Nipton with 5000+ caps in Chainsaw and 6000+ caps in loose change after walking in with a mere 2500
no, I should't joke
also, good news everyone!
probably by Quentin Tarentino
sssjssaaaa
ALL I GET IS AN ACHEIVEMENT?!?
I finally got my tablet to work
Scoot-Scootaloo: eeyup, that's it
neat!
the title is because they main characters are secret agents of Luna's Umbra orgaizations
otakon i dont want to live on this planet anymore
0,14as quickly as I arrive, I must leave
Thats great otakon!
they don't exist to the world
... is it worth is?
Scoot-Scootaloo: not really
0,14brother needs the computer for college apps
thus they are shadows of the moon
The dialog is certainly Tarentino-tier
0,14I'll see you all soon
SaxyPretender: see ya later!
Cya Saxy.
WAAARIOOOOOO
later Saxy!
otakon what do you think of the 3 pictures overall
See ya later SaxyPretender

Some networks are also very lenient about client communication and won't timeout clients even if they appear dead for unusually long times.
take my hand, and we'll make it I sweeear ♪

its a looped recording lol DeadlyDerp3
From the mIRC web site: "mIRC now has a 'check for timed out connections' option in connect/options dialog. When this is set mIRC pings the server every so often if it hasn't heard form the server for a while to test your connection."

/me 8,1glmops kirzstryfe
Huh. Well, my next best thought is that you should try connecting to a server that isn't so distant. You may want to try irc.us.ponychat.net, or look at the map on http://ponychat.net/server-information/ and choose a server closer to you.
/me joins in glomp

Woah.
/me is now oribiting the glomp pile
Full screen chat.
I would try that, and it it doesn't seem to solve the problem, we can look for other causes. I'm doing some network tests from Rarity to your location, and there doesn't seem to be any connectivity problems, but overseas connections are more prone to problems like this.

/me 13hugs MakerDusk nervously
06Stallion_of_War~
hello Phase4
/me hugs everypony~
I thought simply connecting to iris.ponychat.net would shift me over to the closest server.
Hi Violet~
hello Shizuka
<3.
13i... i have never hugged an ircop before...
Gutentag Violet
08,05Guys, I hope you don't mind if I test out certain colors. Will that be okay?
Was I automatically added here because I am a regular?
8,1who's an IRCop?
no, again i derped the link
Woah.
iris.ponychat.net will connect you to one of our Iris web chat servers.
Scoot- Of all the things that could happen, that would be
THE
1,3lol
WORST
Those are some funky colors.
POSSIBLE
hacked mine to autojoin here
THING!
O.O bright text is BRIGHT!
8,1Scoot-Scootaloo: maybe it'd be wiser to do that in another channel?
Looks like. .. spaghetti-os.
That address is meant to be put into a web browser, not an IRC client.
oh...
01,05yeah, ill do that
:(
no one's an ircop
See http://ponychat.net/server-information/ for a list of host names you should use in your client.
but your probably regular enough to be here anyway
this network has none
/me hugs TopHat
07,01ah
good
:)
1,3hehe
07,01so I can allow my bots to enter?
Woah, dark and edgy colors.
Ehh
We don't currently have a geographically-aware host name you can use, which is why we have irc.us.ponychat.net and irc.eu.ponychat.net for regional pools.
/me 11,01hugs Scoot-Scootaloo. Colors!
Lulu: you can try
What color does Wrek use again?
11,01Dark red.
Red on black?
In your case, fluttershy.ponychat.net is probably the best choice.
MakerDusk: do you keep logs of of this room?
I was using the web client
8,1MakerDusk: aha, i see what you did there :P
And I asked what I should put into mIRC
hiya Lulu
And they said iris.
1,3Shizu does
If we're going to be using colors in our text. . . I'll be back shortly. Muahahahahaha.
They were incorrect. :-P

AHHH!! AHHH! my eyes...
/me When I'm war

MakerDusk: dcc?
What is this place filled with so many colors.......
OK
8,1ah, fixed it
13Phase4: IRC can be used to transfer files
06bronystate silly~
1,3^
its like the spectrum exploded in this chat
ah, thought that might be it
8,1somehow, i managed to break the encoding on my terminal session
02,07What is this place filled woth so many wonders~
und all the bunnies! Buuuuuuuuu nieeeeeeesssss!
I switched to using irc.ponychat.net instead of iris.ponychat.net.
11,01First time I used IRC was to transfer files.
13vivi where am i... this is a place filled with... not enough snuggles...
xchat had a file transfer option
O.O
Incidentally, that put you on Rarity again :-P
Midnight_Tempest someone set off a sonic rainboom.
O.@

Also, I vote that you add a derpy.pomychat.net
07,01Check
Casting its spell that I am now under~
oh look, another alternative to megaupload, irc!
/me check
pony*
Like I said, I recommend irc.us.ponychat.net or fluttershy.ponychat.net
Haha
Well
8,1MakerDusk: is it only you as an irc admin?
:3
Shizuka *hugs?
Vivi - No, but I'd like to hear it. I wasn't aware you had done one. I bet it's awesome
/me snuggles Shizuka
We considered that, but decided it would be bad luck; the server itself might end up being derpy and unreliable.
Phase4: yes it does, and it's of course allowed on the network... for banned book purposes
/me 1 2 3 4
/me 13hides under vivi's mane from exploding chat
Well we were going to have vinyl....
I can connect directly to the fluttersh, rarity, etc servers?

8,1i love big cats
On my other network, the servers are for example mother.ournet.net, thunder.ournet.net, lightning.ournet.net

There are more

Why would someone do that D:
Scoot-Scootaloo: You got Color!!!
Midnight_Tempest: you could always join the all german channel on this network...
You have to either use irc.ircstorm.net or www.freejavachat.com as the IRC server address
Ooops
/me throws a pokeball at Scoot-Scootaloo

This isn't a guaranteed fix, but it definitely helps your chances (and your latency).
It connected about 20% faster.

Hello BewareOfBunny! Nice to see ya around.
07,01Yazooooo
hallooo
Well, I notice you identify manually after connecting. It is possible, using some of the methods listed there, to automatically identify during connection, such as by using your services password as the server password. And with SASL or CertFP, your password is not transmitted (though I think you need a script for mIRC for those).
Did anypony else think of the witch from L4D2 when Fluttershy mentioned being startled?
Yazooooo?

LOL
oh placebo.
Cammy :D?!
why couldnt the episode be now
/me wants to see the next episode so bad
Phase4: agreed
they really need more selection for onlive... the games are pretty lacking
becasue having new content in the middle of the week would be weird. look at CN, used to show them on fridays, not they do it mondays
what games would you recommend? just askin
Spoooooar arrow :3
ello herpaderp
SPAM grab!
derp.
placebo, lol
xP
All the games... but then onlive seems to be more about the high performance games... not like steam
ah
though i am surprised the have the old Fallout games on there... those are pretty oldskool games and most comps could easily play them now
zzz?
there are a few on there I'd like to play.
I may try a month of it out.. but meh.
oh... oh.. amnesia...

You don't eat the free sushi they offer you when you purchase a full tank of gas, do you? >.>
anyway, yikes. Later.

SuperBrony64 make sure you play it headphones
it's manditory
^
don't worry there aren't any monster's here
boo
just keep going
the game will show when you have monsters
it's a very disturbing game...
some say it still haunts you after you quit
others say that you never really leave
What game are we talking about?
maybe its just an imagination, however it does a good jop keeping you there
ohai Rainbow-Dash , amnesia
Figured so.
as if its...alive...
And hey. :3
ohai Jim
/me turned on join/part messages
Amnesia is pretty immersive, but the real scary part is not having anything to defend yourself with.
Hello Phase4 :)
many souls have tried this game and many and failed
the game......consumed them....so they say
>went to kitchen for some cereal, sister ate the rest
>first world problems
Ooo, who's playing Amnesia?
SB
xD
SuperBrony64, u is silly filleh
yes thats it SB
keep going
he's gonna poop himself
dont worry

Its anything but alright.
/me is recording this

10,02Midnight_Tempest: If you ever want to play the game, just PM me and you can use my OnLive account
bluestrom_S, i c what you did there
Nothing bad could happen. Right? :$
ohai pony_413793

Ohai ScootaChicken :)

is this amnesia the dark descent?
http://smarthouse.com.au/Content_And_Downloads/Industry/T9S6V9Q5 '...ISPs could implement a "global file registry filter" that would reduce piracy and cap nasties so they become "a very small problem." ' XD
they say the mind like to play tricks on you
But in the dark the evil can't see you...
tricks that only you can imagine
another group thinks is possible to controll the internet
Who am I kidding, they can see you
how quaint
that's the fun about this game
your imagination will work against you
I need to go to lessons now
its 8:39 am, I have a looooong school day ahead of me...
well I'm off to bed
good night all
ohai AppleDash, connection problems?
Good night bluestrom_S
night bluestrom_S
g'night bluestrom_S
I'm off as well
cya ScootaChicken
use your mind sb
your mind is the greatest weapon
plus closets
closets will save you from almost everything monster related
even watching the stream without sound is creepy
The sounds of this game makes everything ten times worse
ariscop, dinging me again
time for new class, be right back

diddutz, hi there, new here?
way to spaz out on the camera there
Phase4: quite new, since last weekend
never played this game, but correct me if i'm wrong, isnt the entire point of this game to screw with you mentally as much as physically possible?
to a sort of cruel and unusual level?
diddutz, neat, hope you enjoy it here
whos streaming?
10,02i liek poniez :3
take it that means sb is streaming

Who loves poniez? SB64 loves poniez! Is it true?
mmmmhmmm
10,02OMG THIS GAME IS SO BORING
lol sb
game that is designed to mentally disturb you to the extreme, "zomg this gaem bores my superior intellect"
10,02It drops my IQ levels definitely
10,02It has been, without a doubt, the WORST GAME EVER. Rest assured I was on the internet in a matter of minutes, registering my disgust with the world.
pick something fun then
always with the r63, always
one of these days sb, one of these days we'll break in to that top secret folder of yours

hahahahha

Ingwaz|laptop, well it was on the stream
suddenly twi
Blah
twilight is best pony
I see them socks
she needs more episode
well...i'm not making much progress on my homework, so i think i'll sleep for a bit then try again
Phase4: shes in like every single episode
if anybody needs more episodes its rarity and applejack
but so is derpy, with about the same amount of screentime
I think Phase is trollen
I think twilight needs a new episode for herself
he could be, or he got applebucked in the head by applejack
We already had Lesson Zero
rarity and applejack got their episodes, cept for "lesson 0" we havent had a real twilight episode
now that you think, she really doesn't have that much
Winter Wrap up
true
but then again, she is the central character
she did get winter wrap up
she doesnt have a ton of episodes strictly devoted to her, but not any of the other mane 6 do either
its usually a combination episode
its because she is usually involved in all the episodes
not this season though
SuperBrony64: have any good music? I cant be bothered to open itunes
in season 1 she was there mostly for filling the letter out
lesson zero was the only episode where we had real character development
meh, i could look up episodes and debate it with you Phase4, but i really shoudl sleep for a bit
good episode though
10,02I can put something on...
Ingwaz|laptop: Bronys shall overcome the need to sleep
The show is about friendships, you can't have Twilight by herself and not building friendships
lesson zero was insanity development, not sure if i'd call it character development
Ingwaz|laptop, yeah, sleep is good
SuperBrony64: Thanks :)
lesson zero was good but not my favorite
same... I really liked winter wrap up
StickySyrup: considering its 03:30, i plan on sleeping for only a few hours, attending a full day at college and donating plasma afterwards, i need sleep
tuuunnneeee
oh sb, you such a troll
nittany discord left and gave us all hugs
dat fml
Ingwaz|laptop: hehe have a good... um... morning then
The first two episodes of any season should count was Twilight Episodes.
i count them as group episodes
no, fist two this season were discord eps
and i loved them
ohai StickySyrup
lol... I clicked the screen... sorry
Oh really, Phase? Who was the one who brought together five opposites into one group?

Anyone heard the Hush now Quiet now remix by princess addictia?
Davie_Jones, honestly? they allready seemed to be friends before twi showed up
Who was the one that Celestia sent to awaken the Elements of Harmony?
night Ingwaz|laptop
twi was simply common ground
Who was the one who figured out what the 'Spark' was?
thats Twilight
nah, realy?
Who brought all the ponies back when they feel into Chaos?
am i still recording?
I need to watch all episodes again... for the 4th time
i am still recording
300mb of near lossless footage
1 hour
recording what?
how do you not notice?
oh
stream and chat
ariscop, ding
HELLO Phase4's recording!!
Then there's Ticket Master...
has anyone heard the Hush now quiet now remix by Princess addictia
Boast Busters
sure
SuperBrony64: ok =) those were the days before I was a Brony
Bridle Gossep
10,02:3
Let me dim the lights....
but they've all been group episodes. wich is apropirate for twi sure but still
we dont have a 'baby cakes' for twi
wow, that was not a sentence i would have ever imagined me saying
lol.... wish I was a Brony sooner
There, I can count at least 6 Twilight centered episodes
And I call them that because for at least 50% percent of the time, the camera is focused on a scene were Twilight is at and is actively partaking in.
i'l give you boast busters, but the rest are more about the interaction of twi with her friends
I mean, for the first one the camera rarely left her.
Phase4: why are you recording?
StickySyrup, testing before the next episode
Same for Winter Wrap Up

xD
lol :P
Davie_Jones, there was a large change from group episodes with minor continuity to individual episodes, but that seems more like experimenting than change in method
@lovemeter Dken2021
Not much changed really
How so?
experimenting in what way?
@lovemeter
nooooo
@lovemeter Dken2021
did it tell you to shutup too?
Davie_Jones, ticket master introduced the gala wich was a recuring theme for the rest of the season
Yes, that was the overarching plot
I think he's beyond repair with all the spam he had to report
most episodes involved the entire mane 6
does anyone else have Brony music on their Ipod, and balst it loud!?!
lol IM NOT GAY
what's with val and tridents?
Amy Keathing Rogers must be a close friend of Lauren Faust.
10,02'I'M NOT GAY'
was that you?
that was val
http://derpy.me/sRsMn this is a real thing that exists, and is by the same writers?
WOAH! Lauren has red hair.
writer'
i must see this movie
red hair FTW
Yes, that is a real movie
Like.. RED hair
(I have red hair)
10,02Dat me :3
you never seen it?
10,02I'm the one talking with the monster ^_^
i think Lauren just grabbed all of the people she used to work with when she made MLP
Everyone who writes episodes in the show has worked with her before.
never seen the powerpuff girls movie
dat ff7 music
when the magical creation of MLP was born
its funny, i'm an 18yo male thats never watched the powerpuff girls movie.
Wait....Not Charoltte Fullerton
Nevermind
would it count as an a or b movie?
It was a TV movie.
looks like a b
so TV movies are automatic B?
I heard you!
They usually have lower budgets
what? ebert gave the movie a thumbs down because it was too violent
10,02I never watched the Powerpuff Girls movie either
Violent?
Dken2021, wait wut
Whois Ebert anyway?
movie critic
under reception
And who is he?
ebert
:P
he's a famous critc
It's meant to be read in a tone that suggests that he has no credabilty in reviewing anything.
10,02i liek poniez :3

/me allso likes poniez
10,02i liek poniez :3
10,02i liek poniez :3
10,02i liek poniez :3
A good review of a critic is to see what he likes.
10,02i liek california :3
I can't find his critic of the movie in question
"Ebert & Roeper gave it "two thumbs down," criticizing that the movie was too violent." from wikipedia is all i can find to
So I'll go by his face. He has an eternal frown that has led to fat to gather at the bottom of his cheeks leading to big jiggling gobles that remind me of McCain so Idon't like him already.

not at all bugeyes
alotta ppl say i seem gay
Ok, i'm not, but i don't take offense to it
bugeyes8: I'd be a horrible judge
i promise you though im not XD
I just see people
I consider it a compliment
and they are catagorized by:physics, math, other, undefined
NItches love gay people
What?
my voice still hasent changed,so i still have a high pitched voice
What about the engineeers?
makes me sounds gay XD
other
with one foot in physics and math
Really? i would think engineers get their own class
/me looks at bugeyes and says,"need a dispenser here!"
/me I'm afraid not.
/me rolls on floor laughing
engineering classes are dumbed down versions of physics and math
Yay, I'm funny!
im honestly surprised i've never been asked out before
they just have practical classes on top of them
engineering is the practical application of maths and physics
alotta the girls at school tell me im cute
no point of either of the later without application
weird huh
Not better or worse than physicists
that's what experimental physicists are for
just a practical application of it.
enough school talk for now guys
/me throws a table and tries to sleep again
im on break

Firefox became bloatware 4 years agp
opera is still nice and thin
so safari>all
Do not start simon2
Chrome>Safari
noone uses god damn opera
Doom 2: The Plutonia Experiment (Played by Wrek)
Lolopera
oops, just meant to copy that
Most people on my course at uni run opera
Safari is chrome without any usability.
about 25/30
I'm not saying you're not allowed to use safari.
Also I'm bugeyes8 simon2
Love and tolerate, even if people have odd browser choices
this level looks interesting
Speed & Security: Chrome ; Customization: Firefox
Essentialy, yes
it like comparing OSX to linux
05Opera, the hipsters choice!
OSX, overpriced, over restricted, no games
linux free, poor ui, but runs on anything
That's what i don't get about gamers choosing macs.
But its the core 'values' i'm talking about.
OSX has no customization, but linux has no speed or security
like value for money? your paying at least 50% more for a mac for comparable hardware
LOL!
seriously nick?
linux no speed/security?
there is a reason its used for every major server ever
I spend 3 hours trying to get my linux computer to run
an OS is only ever as good as its user
I simply don't have the time for messing with everything everytime i want to use my computer
I don't use OSX
operating system, windows linux or mac
I use windos 7. Not too happy about it, but i have to game, and i don't have time for linux bullsh*t
8,1http://i.imgur.com/hrpFi.jpg
I configured an old laptop to linux for learning, and it is a huge pain to get to do ahything
wtf horse
wow, thats creepy
GAH
8,1i use Linux mainly, because it's my most comfortable envirnoment to work in, probably mainly out of habit
The point of linux is long setup, never ever goes down afterwards
Dude, that';s creepy
8,1but i also have mac os and windows installed
8,1windows for gaming, and mac os for... well, just because it's fun to have a hackintosh
lol
I understand the draw for linux, I just don't have the time for it.
05i run OS8 in an emulater enviroment
Makes sense
8,1though really, i don't actually game much
05im telling ya, extracting ROM files is hard work
8,1literally, the time i spend gaming is about a week or two every year
That's ok, i don't game as much as i say
maybe an hour or two a week
Hell yeah
go marathon
8,1but it's nice being able to boot into any of the three main OSes when i need to
d'awww filly derp
derpeh ^_^
8,1but yeah, i'd recommend mac os over linux any day, unless you have a specific reason to use linux
8,1and this is coming from a massive linux nerd ;)
05something is eating my comp power
05but oh well
05lets see how this goes
8,1Wrek: it's me
Wrek, the stream :P
Like i said, i have a little experience with linux, but not enough t be good enough for my main computer to run off it
05nope unfoundbug
05had it been that i wouldnt mention it
fair enough
8,1Nick: one of the best ways to learn it is to force yourself to use it, then you get accustomed to it
The only time i get performance hits anymore is fraps
And i use chrome for it's speed and Awesome UI
8,1chrome is awesome, but i do have a couple of gripes with it (mainly UI, but some API too)
8,1but still, it's sooo much better than firefox
My graphics card handles recording BF3 in 1080 like a champ
8,1even if it takes up a hell of a lot more memory
