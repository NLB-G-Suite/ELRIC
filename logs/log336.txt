Doom 2: Plutonia Experiment

Never played the doom games
Davie jones locker~ Arrg~
Weird, usually by now I'd have someone saying: "You never played Doom before?"
those explosions look out of place
And no, it's supposed to be a conbonation of 'Davie Crocket' and 'Indiana Jones'
Unforunately its getting more common
unfortunately*
Well I haven't played doom soo~
just saw a hilarious comment on YT on a K-Pop song.
It's hard to make myself go back to 2.5D
Get ALL of the ammo
oooh webons cashe FTW!
And the bad reviews of Doom 3 put me off as well
yfw this was someone's childhood
yfw?
05,15Doom 3 wasn't that bad. Just, bad design
doom 3 was fun but reviewed under the wrong mindset
I didn't mean it was bad
Well the main problem most people had was that you can't use a flashlight and a gun at the same time.
/me is listening to more gothic metal.
05,15Duct Tape mod
Aren't you playing a marine?
Kinda ruins the atmosphere hacing both
i think i could not play doom, the voices would scare the shit outta me
You would they would have run out of monsters by now
/me would die way to quickly if had to play doom irl :/
05,15No like, there really was a duct tape mod
There was?
Yes Tovler~

yeeeeah this song
cider you say?
/me eats oats and washes it down with soymilk
That episode was a little wierd if viewed from uk perspective,
cider is alcoholic in uk
i am bulletproof *haha*
apparently not in us
a round of cider for everypony
13in the US "cider' is pretty much carbonated apple juice
we have a name for that, appleade
all ponies looked like alocoholics
hm, I've never tried cider
homebrew cider is NICE
CIDER.....Yay
cider is not alcoholic?
cider is mostly alcoholic, however the cidder in the episode was made during one day, thus no alcohol
I like merrydown cider
they sure do like their cider, especially Rainbow
Cider is unfiltered, unfermented juice.
In the US, only HARD Cider is alcoholic
oooo that makes sense
http://derpy.me/AhlAd
Lol hard cider in US = normal cider in UK
Cheeers!
lol
:)
I though hard means distilled
I havnt seen non--alocoholic cider in UK at all
+t
If you add preservatives to cider, you get juice
how does one make cider?
Sticky, its just applejuice
at leas good cyeder doesnt lol
not sure why I did that
non alcoholic cider is thick apple juice
That's how you get cider
that's it?
CRUSH!
my friend said that the ponies were all drunks and I said that the cider was made and then served the next day. It didnt have time to ferment
13wrek, mancubus takes three rockets, shoot at range as you run up
/me jumps our of the shadows and glomps everyone
13or that
:O
made a batch once left it to ferment too long

NO it isn't
And I like halo as well :3
I totally see myself skipping console gaming all together.
The first Halo was ok
Oh no...
It was actually one of my first FPS games~
Can I make a request of the mods?
First Halo is best Halo imo

They should make a mod that turned off Duke's Voice
Now that really was the best shooter ever made
It was oaky...
Yes, Goldeneye was always fun.
okay*
me and my friends only play multiplayer in goldeneye
Four player deathmatch with my brothers was awesome.
Davie at the time I don't think they were worried about the writing. It was a simple time
Glad we all grew up then
never touched singleplayer
I hate it when games are 100% different from the other console it was also made on~
I remember seeing a brother of a friend play Goldeneye when I was young

0,5Wow
That's international.
0,5REALLY
0,5You JUST heard about this?

ACTA? the bill USA signed in October?
That's the problem, they try to keep it under wraps.

http://i.imgur.com/y0J6w.jpg
0,5SAY NO TO ACTA
?
Why*
Virtually every first-world nation has already signed it. >_>
lol, we were telling people to ST_U about SOPA/PIPA in October.
0,5But the more we act.
The EU, for the most part, signed it about a week or two ago.
meow
05,15booo
haha EspyLacopa~
You should play Amnesia
05,15Question, should I buy Counter Strike or Counter Strike Source.

Hey there~
hmmm
Haaaaaiii
CounterStrike Source

Oh Wreky~ I thought you where getting some sleep~
/me played Amnesia. Nightmares were recurring and paronia attacks were had....
05as did I
And its effects are technically supposed to be in place already.
its ok
I'm sad that Megaupload is guilty until proven innocent.
: (
as I recall, there was something about the individual countries still having to agree with it, like Congress haven't to approve the president's signature
they were already proved guilty
there we go
/me pets the kitty
hm?
They just haven't set up the infrastructure for it yet, as I recall.
13nya?
internal emails were seized which showed them knowing about illegal content and using it for personal gai
Flaria~!
I don't remember.
/me hugs Flaria~
And the only way that Congress can override the president's vote, as far as the US goes, is for them to find a way to legally declare ACTA as a treaty.
/me hugs Nyria~
problem with ACTA: it is IMPOSIBLE to impliment the level of regulation the bill calls for
as in imposible, cannot be done
But it's not, not really. It's a trade agreement, and Congress has no say in the president's ability to sign trade agreements, technically.
there is way to much bandwidth to filter
Here's the basics:
^
thats the basics?
Congress can't do squat about it unless one of two things can be proven:
you play together?
2) That ACTA serves the function of a treaty, thereby falling under Congress's duties as part of their ability to regulate commerce.
Neither of these are actually options, and neither is a priority since all eyes have been turned to the presidental primaries.
Senate votes on Treaties
Yes. But it's not a treaty, that's my point.
doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom
Congress would have to prove that it IS a treaty, and they can't. Because it's not.
^
0,5So dont worry.
"passes"
It's not a law
xD
0,5Oh well
It's a trade agreement and it's already taken effect technically.
I would like to see an up rise~
0,5NO
I'd kill to be able to vote "no confidence" on the ballot.
no I dont
It's just that the infrastructure demanded by ACTA has not actually been put in place yet.
omg again
0,5Oh well

The idea that a company should be able to get a government to do the hard work for them is pretty reprehensible.
D: Nuuuuuu
yes
at least only burn SOPA/PIPA supporters
CrtiicKitten I'm not disagreeing with you.
You want to get rid of corporate interference? You need to get rid of capitalism. Not half-heartedly either.
*Entirely*.

Comprehensive conspiracies don't work in the end. Event conspiracies are possible, if improbable. How does the NWO work? If the participants are really that vicious, wouldn't they just murder one another?

The only way that large-scale overthrowing of a government works is if Lelouch is the one leading it. In any other situation it sorta doesn't fly. >_>

05,15I don't think revolt is necessary.
I'll wait for the next global economic meltdown before I make a move.
Celestia didn't send Luna to the moon because she was jealous of her power, she sent her to the moon because authority figures fuck up.

8,1Phase4: no telescope
You're missing out meh.
i know
can't we all live in a peacefull society, like the smurfs, or the ponies

good raw material
Saturn: oh, i derp read sometimes. nice camera

/me grows a Stalin moustache in protest.
No it doesn't.
They've just MADE it that way.
It always took campaignig, it just had a smaller pool of voters.
Is it SFW?!
Running for president does not require that the campaign start 2 years into the existing guy's term. >_>

But I'd be sent a speech, and I'd be told to deliver it on his behalf.
Saturn, do you which part of the sky did you photograph?
This worked at the time because there was no effective means of the candidate reaching the masses on their own.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sZjpStFNY&feature=related
Our voting pool is much bigger, now.
This is good, but it makes that sort of thing impractical.
alternative vote?
And yet we purposefully drag out the campaign term MUCH longer than necessary.
Hai
The population is larger but the technology is also VASTLY improved.
you're killing me Saturn
Well, the presidential Campaign is literally longer.
*Shudders* I really shouldn't be reading Creepypasta at 9 aclock..But oh well...
Congressmen used to campaign more, and the legislative season was shorter.
Well, I misspoke. The Legislative season was shorter, but Congressmen campaigned much differently than they do now.
Retail politics were the only method.
And the Presidential candidates didn't go out and do retail politics on their own.
There's no easy answer, per se, but with a parliamentary-style voting process, we could at least stop voting for the lesser of two evils.

In some countries, a bribe comes with the implicit threat of murder for non-compliance. Yet still some people refuse.
should i color my Pinkie Pie picture?
well take a look http://derpy.me/5jaNE i think it would ruin it
Well, if you don't vote, they won't listen.
If you vote and they ignore you, it's a tragedy.

it's not about "voting," it's about shouting with a loud enough voice

unfortunately, democracy tames most shouts

lol call of duty
xbox version
I didn't take that
I said someone else did
2 instruments at the same time?
i think is the wii version
But it is of the same constellation
Battlefield ftw
Well lotta help this turned out to be
Sorry :(
everyone has an opinion
tru
Anyway, ponies.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvr09PCWuuk easily the best song in Skyward Sword.
I like 'em. A lot.
lol
Ime too!
me too
how wierd
mmmm, yes quite
It is a pony calendar.
rather than a political discussion
hello
All pony is best pony.
Pinkie Pie!
luna
Those ponies have huge foreheads
/me climbs into Ari's lap and growls softly
1,3watch the allcaps please
Moosic~
wahahahahahario!
<3
sorry
:)
hello
I honestly cant decide :/.
They'd be heretics.
Because ponies are xenos
but hi
I guess I have to say RD lol
Hi Morty!
:3
This is wrong. . .
Boss tiem
omg wario
They believe The Emprah rides Celestia into Battle.
Most people call me LTB though
who's da emprah?
When did you start coming here?
3Hai Morty!
hi silly
sillymoon
bad inside joke... in 40K, the God-Emporer of Mankind is the ruler of humans.
Emperor*
30 more minutes until I can sleep
That's good
3:3 yay~
Yay~
3x3
hello again everyone
I just lurked
I slowly gained friends
The other towns have lots of Male Ponies
3TopHat I was the same as you, but look at me now
wario is now 20% cooler
haha ya
lol
Flim and Flam made up for the lack of male representation.
FOR THE EMPRAH!
And where's the Queen?
I'll never be a mod though
You never know
never say never
3It's a fun job if you have the time
but I don't want the responsibility
except when you say "never say never"
When I used to run with the "Tyrant Celestia" trolls I'd say the Males are fighting wars of conquest, lol.
then u can say it twice :P
is it RD playin this?!
I rather like being a resident
wtf
I just
infoundbug, or lives long enough
I feel sad.
I don't know why. I just do.
3Well, maybe you should try to be a mod when we start accepting applications again
cept hanging here, being with gf and writing
ok maybe ^-^
That would make the most sence too, and Celestia is keeping the rest of the population ignorant of the ongoing wars
1984 all over again.
There's little implication there's a war on in Equestria. It could also be universal male Conscription.
do you get payed? lol
Something on my mind?
Well, there's quite a lot.
it could just be genetically males are less viable than females
Basically, the fellas are watching the border.
Maybe the males all died in the war
1,3lol, paid
1,3nope
maybe he was too young for war?
Paid. That's a good on---Wait do you?
Maybe he finished his tour.
good lol
Draft dodger
3No, no, you don't get paid
Hurr hurr.
or inb4 it's a show about silly ponies, no need to go deeper than that
This is all headcanon, mind.
3That is unless you guys donate to us
I like being a resident
1,3not that Slurry knows at least :3
Hey
half the fun is making up backstory though
i wanna donate!
Hey
Hello, Everypony!
:)
the "it's just a show" thing mean I wins the agrument.
I'll donate all my money!

3x3
:)
Does anyone here recomend Hawx 1?
3Suddenly Luna
rayman
World-building is fun, but to be honest, the "Conscription" Theory isn't internally consistent.
Suddenly rare names
1,3hehe
I got it on xbox, i really enjoyed Hawx
yes
it's alright
Um
as long as you get custom soundtracks going
i had it for PS3
hi Luna
Hawx 1?
07,01hello
just be sure to have flight of the valkyries ready to play nduring the dogfights
yeah
1,3I think it's running on autopilot atm, nobody's actually playing
:>
lol unfound
/me noms on zapapple
the bombing runs are a bit dull
Yeah
Hahaha
its REALLY fun
07,01hello everypony
i was jokin
How's the cockpit and controls?
1,3:p
Ponies fight Buffalo with Pie.
only played xbox
but felt pretty solid
07,01not in mIRC but yea if i'm logged in via the web...I get pinged
maybe their "catering" business is secretly a ammunition store
ok
thanks
was raqyman humpin the air?
Oh......
I'm back!
the camera was pretty nice as well, multiple modes was cool
buffalo? with pie?!
Luna was banished to the Moon for opposing the war efforts
not much
:P6_9
I like that jingle
Actually, I find it more dreadful to think that Celestia made a horrible mistake.
07,01it's alright
/me dreams Equestria
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu.
...
Luna wouldn't have gotten out if it weren't for her escape effort
ck
RayMan?
type out?
Not that she was oppressing ponies, and banished Luna for her defiance.
You did have the name first
/me is glomped
Hi there :3
how come were the only ones talkin
1000 time out
just a matter of scale
I used to have real-life friends, like you.
If it annoys her I can, I really don't mind
:)
then you took a pony to the mind?
hahaha
Then I took a fluttershy to the d'awww
07,01nope

I did?
i meen subscribed
kind of like letting Spike in while they're changing
1,3lol, she's allowed to do pretty much anything she wants to :p

"We don't normally wear clothes..."

I need to figure out how to use auto join script
I've been much more careful since then.

All right

That is not on our end.
It happens at least once daily.
0,14a long time
0,14?
I just fought one! They came up to me from behind!
though if you encounter them in the right way, they can also be hilarious

I know I do
but I blame my ed

/me explodes into confetti
he's just a hop
A skip!
I see about 15 per day for you
You have a large ping timeout time

Ahhhh
1,3depends on the situation

I thought you meant me
D:

My other server only does about 25 seconds before timeout
You weren't asking for help. :-\
11,01I know.
Twilight is grabbing her to teleport
oops
13also today you learned it's "free rein" not "free reign" cause reign implies you can already do whatever you want
to a pony that hit on her
DAMNIT i lost it again
you lost
whose up for cider
NO, this tab
lol
but that too
11,01it is reins

1,3do you plan on her getting involved with said pony?
ok
no
but how is it?
he has a gf!
?
1,3then I'd go with a regular noooooooo
I fought a young Deathclaw! It destrolished me!
that was my gut feeling
And how do I do that? I've never heard of that option in mIRC
but Fluttershy saying nyuuuu=me want :3
it's completely plausible to defeat Deathclaws at level 3
1,3Morty's writing a story
oh
he knows
Is it like a Freddy Krueger Gauntlet?
he's read the prologue
fanfic'
but Deathclaws are NASTEE!
%SaxyPretender when did you become a streamer
insanely fast, lots of health and they do HUGE damage
0,14not a streamer, but a mod
What's the name?
the best bet is to have a high sneak
shadows of the moon
Shadows of the Moon
when didyou become a mod
I shall check it out
and take them out with sneak shots with a high power weapon to the head or legs
I'm also playing on Hardcore, and let me tell you something... ITS HARD
I could see this movie getting remade.
the prologue just introduces some OCs and sets a scene
FOSO
3hmm... nice title
0,14as for when I became a mod, about...2 and half weeks ago?
cool
no, I should't joke
also, good news everyone!

Moths are alright, but they piss me off because they always try and kill themselves in my lights and I have to throw them outside.
Yeah, those stupid moths...
There more gentle than butterflies
But I still hate them. Hate them more than spiders

8,1also, you get plenty pretty day-flying moths: http://www.thegardenhelper.com/screensaver/flutterbys/graphics/cinnabarmoth.JPG
actually i dont hate spiders
i found them cute
/me saw a spider today and flipped out.
Pretty moth.
Saturn are you sure that is a moth it dosent have the fuzzy antenna thing most moths have
I especially hate it when the spider crawls onto my Computer screen
I hope I can become an Entomologist when I graduate.

Hi Violet~
<3.
13i... i have never hugged an ircop before...
Was I automatically added here because I am a regular?
8,1who's an IRCop?
Woah.

1,3lol
WORST

THING!
1,3Saturn pays attention :3
8,1Scoot-Scootaloo: maybe it'd be wiser to do that in another channel?
Looks like. .. spaghetti-os.
That address is meant to be put into a web browser, not an IRC client.
oh...
01,05yeah, ill do that
:(
no one's an ircop
this network has none
07,01ah
good
:)
1,3hehe
07,01so I can allow my bots to enter?
Ehh
We don't currently have a geographically-aware host name you can use, which is why we have irc.us.ponychat.net and irc.eu.ponychat.net for regional pools.
I was using the web client

06bronystate silly~
1,3^
8,1somehow, i managed to break the encoding on my terminal session
und all the bunnies! Buuuuuuuuu nieeeeeeesssss!
I switched to using irc.ponychat.net instead of iris.ponychat.net.
11,01First time I used IRC was to transfer files.
13vivi where am i... this is a place filled with... not enough snuggles...
xchat had a file transfer option
O.O
Incidentally, that put you on Rarity again :-P
O.@
lol
06Stallion_of_War: .-. you referencing mein cover?
lol
Also, I vote that you add a derpy.pomychat.net
07,01Check
oh look, another alternative to megaupload, irc!
/me check
pony*
Like I said, I recommend irc.us.ponychat.net or fluttershy.ponychat.net
Haha
Well
:3
We considered that, but decided it would be bad luck; the server itself might end up being derpy and unreliable.
/me 1 2 3 4
I can connect directly to the fluttersh, rarity, etc servers?

Why would someone do that D:
You have to either use irc.ircstorm.net or www.freejavachat.com as the IRC server address
Ooops

It would still be possible to get around that

And hey. :3

Amnesia is pretty immersive, but the real scary part is not having anything to defend yourself with.

hahahahha
Blah
twilight is best pony
I see them socks
she needs more episode
if anybody needs more episodes its rarity and applejack
he could be, or he got applebucked in the head by applejack
We already had Lesson Zero
rarity and applejack got their episodes, cept for "lesson 0" we havent had a real twilight episode
now that you think, she really doesn't have that much
Winter Wrap up
but then again, she is the central character
she did get winter wrap up
she doesnt have a ton of episodes strictly devoted to her, but not any of the other mane 6 do either
its usually a combination episode
its because she is usually involved in all the episodes
not this season though
in season 1 she was there mostly for filling the letter out
lesson zero was the only episode where we had real character development
good episode though
10,02I can put something on...
The show is about friendships, you can't have Twilight by herself and not building friendships
lesson zero was good but not my favorite
same... I really liked winter wrap up
tuuunnneeee
dat fml
The first two episodes of any season should count was Twilight Episodes.
i count them as group episodes
and i loved them
lol... I clicked the screen... sorry
lol
nn everypony
10,02Night ^_^
thats Twilight
nah, realy?
am i still recording?
I need to watch all episodes again... for the 4th time
i am still recording
300mb of near lossless footage
1 hour
oh
HELLO Phase4's recording!!
Then there's Ticket Master...
Boast Busters
sure
Bridle Gossep
10,02:3
Let me dim the lights....
wow, that was not a sentence i would have ever imagined me saying
There, I can count at least 6 Twilight centered episodes
And I call them that because for at least 50% percent of the time, the camera is focused on a scene were Twilight is at and is actively partaking in.
I mean, for the first one the camera rarely left her.
Same for Winter Wrap Up
@pony
that seems to work
yup, but at least not many ppl are here
you are free to think that.
it picks at random

I think he's beyond repair with all the spam he had to report

8,1Nick: one of the best ways to learn it is to force yourself to use it, then you get accustomed to it
The only time i get performance hits anymore is fraps
8,1chrome is awesome, but i do have a couple of gripes with it (mainly UI, but some API too)
1080p recording is not a subtle thing
