Agreed

I prefer the rock version of this song
Get it right this time Rarity! Do eet!!

The fanfics that have spawned from Cupcakes makes Cupcakes worth it.

what about 15% cooler?
ponyspin.com Is this questionable?
You know, there was nothing wrong with Dash's final dress.

You know you're all my very best FRIENDS!

This show has given me mental peace.
Who will reign supreme! Iron Pony!
awesome music
nice riff
I think they normally record scenes like that twice, once with the VA in each role and someone else filling in the other one
Roders: too late XD
GO RAINBOW!
AND EVIL MAKES IT ALL COMPLETE
my vote is for applejack
WOOOH
Riders*
Dash needs a Rocky montage.
needs moar guile's theme
stretchy stretchy!
wingboner
On that note, Dash and Applejack's VA is in a band called Hey Ocean! You can find their songs on Youtube and they rock.
stretch those muscles!
epic stretching
Rainbowdash is Kanye West.
I lost, Dash. I lost the game.
0sexy

Rainbow_Dash, I will be watching your every move
Rainbow Dash has a bad habit of- "FINISHING SENTENCES!"
Borimare, what game?
I hope that doesnt disturb you
dash is best pony
*cough* *cough* Dem Wings. . .
RD needs to have a rock anthem
tbh, I find Hey Ocean a little boring

11inb4 Cheating dash
plot
Pinkie_Pie, but I thought we got TwilightSparkle for that?
US
one voice actor talking to herself
too late >.<
they just sound pretty conventional
gasp, what happened to the quality? 0.o
like old 70's hard rock/ classic metal
0@Borimare, I lost THE GAME already too.
My rainbow dash toy is happy
Boing Boing Boing

Silverscreen, I didn't cheat!

Hi everypony =)
Doh
DANG NABIT

DARN YOU, BARREL
I wonder how much ashleigh got payed from this episode...
I love Pinkie Pie's squeeky hop.
haha, you fail AJ
GOOOOOOOO DASH
she looked behin her, slowed her down
>17 second run
Rainbow, fly over the barrels!
Rainbow_Dash, my eyes are allseeing.
Dumb barrel!
That's a bigass penalty
Wingboner hah
Dash just pretends to lose for other's self esteem. Like Chuck Norris
I like hearing Ashleigh argue with herself.
rainbow can do this in 10 seconds flat
11Stupid drunk idiots outside. >.<
And go!
you mean Bruce Lee
DSNesmith: 18 seconds.
my god shes awesome...
I have no idea why my name is Yellow. Can't seem to change it without changing my text.
>18 second run
I'm just so humble.
more like LESS than 10 seconds flat...
pff
WTF
And win
that was like 4
yeah Hipster_Brony you mad :D
BROHOOF
>Applejack is faster than Dash
AJ would probably run faster if she took of that unaerodynamic hat.
yes, she is sure
Time must be quicker in Ponyville
0aj won
sorry about that silver
how bout 16?
ding!
how is applejack faster???
FLutters as a scoregirl.
0inb4 JOHN MADDEN
pinkie pie is the fastest
this isnt fair
It's cool how they started out in FRIENDLY competition, and then Rainbow got competitive, and ruined everything.
It bothers me how Twilight pronounces "Rainbow Dash". The spacing is off
applejack has strong legs
APPLEJACK PWNAGE
Earth Ponies have nothing going for them.
Borimare: It's just so you can see your name easier. your name appears green to everyone else.
she does this as a job
steroids

Rainbow Dash and Applejack are the same voice actor, so technically she's having a contest with herself.

0DAMN
0RD is cheating~
>Dash cheating at the long jump
She Jelly
cheats and lies
they all have big eyes
Wings require more oxygen than leg muscles
DuskShine I didn't cheat.
Ding
/me cheats at push ups as well :3
obvious cheating is obvious
Ponies doing push ups is not the weirdest thing I've seen today.
CHEAAAAAT

MOAR CHEAP HAX
LOLOLOLOL

That riff is awesome, somebpony needs to tab it

So it requires MORE effort
Doctor WHooves!
hahaha
NOW THE GOAL HERE IS TO CARRY CHICKS WITHOUT GETTING THEM MUDDY
thats not cheating
Science fail
>Dash being smarter than Applejack
Chicks dig you Rainbow_Dash
she needs a ban hammer!
>It's not cheating because nobody said she couldn't use her wings
not really cheap this time...
well, i mean they all do but Twilights seem bigger
more cheap
Rainbow Dash is boss
chicks dig RD
8apparently using your natural physical talents is cheating now
Sounds like the intro riff to Shredded Humans by Cannibal Corpse
angry birds
applejack has years of bucking expierience
Pinkie_Pie, it's cause I'm so awesome. :)
this was a contest her wings could help her in
lyra!
BACON
KING OF CHEAP HAX

i'm pretty sure this here isn't how you do a tug of war
0SUCK MY DICK AJ

Nope
The diagnosis is: butthurt
Oh wow, that comic posted on EQD is actually pretty cool
trololololololol
tying down Rainbow's wings for the comp is like breaking Yao Ming's legs because he's too tall for basketball
BLANK FLANK
also, anyone else know that every va is canadian?
11Derpy
Dash > Applejack
AJ sounds like such a man sometimes...
U Jelly, AJ?
They've got a rainbow flag.
ooh
What time does this start Tomorrow?
That wasn't cheating at all.
wing power!
Hipster_Brony: AJ, as the element of Honesty, trusts Dash enough to not use her wings as an advantage. it has nothing to do with being atheletic.
this is the same town that thinks Trixie actually beat her competitors, I think that there was no easy way to determine this contest :P
man those background ponies must have really boring lives
Sour apples are good.
she only cheated in 3 or 4 rounds > won by 10
sour grapes
0WHERES WHOOVES
DASH > ALL
yesh.
Shad: maybe not all were shown?
He was in the background
We seriously need this show in Sweden, like pronto
Unicorns>All inferior pony races
If Trixie were here she would have won EVERYTHING.
How many times has she pulled Dash's tail?
i want to see an actually leaf race now

Dash's tail tastes like skittles
Nope.avi Spike
TASTE THE MUTHAFUCKING RAINBOW
Well Applejack has been using her other powers (Earthpony strength etc) to win, has used her legs and such a lot more as she doesn't fly so she would normally have an advantage.
Failed

DuskShine, uh, no, not the tail...

yep
>Guess who gets ahead of them
she gets the job because she brought her own balloon
man ppl like to take spike's job...
>MFW
Suffuri the problem there is that RD has legs as well. AJ does not _have_ wings
their ecosystem is broken
Derpy!
so is that balloon not twilights? or does pinkie just take it?
she is so totally on crack
double bon-bon

likely story
Rainbow_Dash: This announcer has no comments
"ONE OF my favourite seasons"? There's, like, four.

INB4 SARSAPARILLA
Saspirilla!

Pinkie does more drugs then Charlie Sheen
Pinkie is like a cartoon character that escaped to the real world
"again"? that means she would need a break from drugs
I'm not talking about the boring everyone just sitting around thing, either.

FLUTTERSHY GETS TICKET
THE END
I still hope for an angel-centric episode in season 2
That's how Fluttershy keeps up her innocent appearance... she gets Angel to do her dirty work
I LOVE YO FLUTTERSHY

angry fluttershy?
ARE YOU CRAZY
8OATMEAL!
Derpy thinger.
FLuttershy has teh worst reason.
oh pinkie pie you are so random
Awww that whine was adorable
4Applejack deserves the ticket. She was there when Twilight got the tickets from Celestia, and she has the only non personal reason for going (wants to make money for her family)
We need a Gumbow Dash fic. >_>
go on shoo
fluttershy can just go to the zoo
Fluttershy has the least selfish reason.
rarity needs a tophat and a monocle
0 201 to 151! UNACCEPTABLE!
Im eating the carrots atm.
Applejack has the worst reason. You're invited to a gala, and you go there to SELL APPLES? Seriously... Nio
GummyDash shipping
Ghosties: THANK YOU. Seriously.
Ghosties, Applejack is worst pony
what makes an unselfish reason better than a selfish reason?
Twilight should just pick whoever she thinks she'll have the most fun with.
Love me love me not
isnt money normally a selfish pursuit?
4Fluttershy only wants to go for herself
who should go with me?
gummytwist is best ship
4Pinkie wants to go for herself
desperate noms
NOM
Apprentice1994: how about I slap your shit?
4RD wants to go for herself
0THE NUMBER'S DROPPING! RUN TO DA CHOPPA
really good reasons
rarity has the worst reason
That was atimmy moment
ham: have you seen best night ever? she's arguably the most selfish of all.
Ghosties: Agreed, even though Pinkie's my fav, she's definitely the most selfish. :p
Rarity wants to get laid
I read that gummy x twist fic
4Rarity wants to go for herself
she should just got by herself
it was serious lulz
CAJ, that sounds disgusting
fluttershy is best pony
EXTRA CRISPY
4AJ wants to go for her family
she and spike
I wonder how hayfries taste
spike is best, he doesnt want to go
twlight was going to invite applejack first, danced with applejack when she got them.
and the money :P
yeah, AJ has the best reason
CAJ, also ineffective...
Ghosties is officially the best mod.
You should give me the ticket!
RBD has the second best, because she wants to go to start her career
pinkie isn't selfish, she throws parties and bakes for everyone
... I love how gems are so common in this world and come precut.
Sad Pinkie is Sad
http://images.wikia.com/mlp/images/4/49/Horte_Cuisine.png
applepie is a good fic
Come on TwilightSparkle!
they gonna be mad bro
FEKKIN' SAVED
AJ has good intentions, but it's horribly thought out.
eat
Out of all of them, AJ has the best reason, because she's going for the whole farm
Look, she was planning on fluttershy and applejack
ghosties is the best mod
Im sure every thing will be better once I eat grrrrrrr
In ze rain?
We need more Raridash.
eat it now
grats dash
What are you doing
OH STOP GROVELING
Nice reversal of the usual comic thundercloud over someone's head.
actually, dari is best mod, but ghosties comes close
And the favors begin
Dash needs to troll more with weather
8ceiling pony is best pony
PP, RD, and rarity were shown upset
0applejack has the best reason
IF THERE'S ONE THING I CAN'T STAND
ITS GROVELING
she probably put the cloud there too
Ceiling Pony > Ceiling Cat
obviously she was gonna pick Fluttershy and Applejack
0Suddenly... BEAM OF LIGHT
Twilight is unamused
Who me? Of course not!
me? Oh no, no! <Rainbow Dash is the best. All other arguments are invalid

D&B in audiosurf is so awesome
why does I find this song so damn cute
So where do you get audio surf?
I could run this song without hitting a grey.
it's real cheap on steam
0i like this! :)
it's like 10bucks or something
agreed\
its so...hypnotising
I didn't know this was on steam.
0Hax?
eeeeeeeee
10$? for 10 bucks you could get Deus Ex: GOTY edition.
just wait for a sale, it will be practically free
4Post-rock is excellent music to play Audiosurf to...actually, post-rock is excellent music regardless
It regularly goes on sale on Steam.
soft reverb is what sells it
LUDICROUS SPEEED.
you need fast beats for fun songs
ugh, I prefer the non-extended edition
Usually for like $2.50
well im leaving
drum and bass is the way to go
bai

HEY EVERYPONY? did you all know the voice of rarity is the most used voice in the show?
That song was so creepy when I heard it as a kid.
i would totally headbang to a death meatl version of this song XD preferably done by children of bodom
@Applejackismaiwaifu that's proof that you're a true brony :P
rarity's voice is voice for celestia, and the shadow bolts
Dyed in the mane, brah
Wait wat

my favorite episode involves a pink horse breaking down and talking to a bag of flour and a bucket of turnips

Twilight, the question should rather be who DON'T know them. They are excellent games.
Mortal Kombat Legacy has a new episode Cyrax and Sektor
0Cause I recently 100%ed Banjo Tooie xbox live arcade and banjo kazooie nut nuts and bolts

The best fighting game will default to "My Little Pony: Fighting Is Magic" once they finish it.
Sell MVC 3 to get MVC 3 Ver 2.0
0Agreed and will play as the best pony ever ME!
so many people can't take a loss on MK tho
Come on Twi, everyone knows Dash is the best pony.

oh wait a minute
Twilight, I admit, I'm totally going to be maining you when it comes out.

Valthejean is gar for Caramel

savory the delightful twitches of pain
I will end you
Val, that sounds like a horribly inefficient kill
mark my words
i think i'll fix me another peanut butter sandwich
I will end you
I shall now commence my reading of "cupcakes"
herospirit: that's called torture. not swift death.
Twilight wants more Big Mac x Caramel?

DOH!
0NO
0no no no
So Twilight, who would you prefer?

0thats classified thank you very much
I cannot abide this tomfoolery and unprofessionality from you, Val. Such a killing is horribly messy and a waste of others' time. For shame.

.....
0http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2rDbRUDkds&feature=relmfu
Why did I click on that image?
The air was warm, the sun was shining, and all of Ponyville was having a glorious day.
TNT!!!
Aw yeah! http://i.imgur.com/IIfNd.jpg
Dashite: you did it! he fled before the beauty of Caramac
The air was warm, the sun was shining, and all of Ponyville was having a glorious day.
Hi Pinkie!
Busy ponies were making their busy way through the streets. All the pony folk seemed to have somewhere to be.
TNT...looks harmless to play wi- *BOOM*
Busy ponies were making their busy way through the streets. All the pony folk seemed to have somewhere to be
0"Revenge" is better though
0This guy is pretty good at these.

All, except Rainbow Dash. Her place was in the sky. She freely tore through the air, speeding one way and the next.

i actually had that dream multiple times that same night
I once had a dream where I was awake all night staring at the ceiling.
0Dream-ception?
My dream's are more like pinkie pies, they are so random and they dont make senes.
13We must go deeper!
9Looks like Dermathil's blasting off again!!!!!!!! (Goodnight all, and you can give the theatrical exit kick please, Octavia.)
Because in my dream I actually told a Pony "I wish you were real." They said "I know" and began to cry.
My dreams (at least the recurring ones) are more scripted than CoD games.
That's when I discovered I still had emotions!
13:)
Good way to send someone off to bed by giving them a good kick
13Lmao
13Indeed
13Play'em off keyboard cat!@

Medic shotgun.
Medic shotgun. It cures Zombies.
Well, Zecora's not a pony, so, idk
I have trouble choosing a favorite. Every Pony is Best Pony
<3^
Octavia is totally best pony.
When he means cure it means it kills you making you loose a life
im a pony whore as well
Stop your slander Darf!
sorry
Medic would never be so uncouth
my current favs are spitfire, applejack, applebloom, scootaloo, and twilight
sparkle
A lot of people say Twilight is Worst Pony. I don't get it.
me neither
i dont blive that
twilight is really good
IS MOTHERFORKING BACK, MOTHERFORKER!
Twilight is worst? Nah. Dunno why they say that. Twilight is pretty cool.

0Im not one to brag bur I know how to use magic QUITE nicely\
HAHAHA, SILLY TURT! FORKS ARE NOT MOTHERS
i think applejack or rarity is worst, applejack's accent annoys me and rarity just seems sort of bitchy
HEY, there are NO WORST PONIES.
:[
Least best?
Rarity is my least favorite...that is until I saw the Diamond Dogs episode
thats a dumb reason to dislike
Not even least best. I can let "least favorite" slide though.
flutterdash/rainbowshy is best pony
Sounds good.
who wants to see my fluttershy meme????/??
sure go ahead
ok, brb
sure!
I'd like to... Well, if you want to...

Oh dear, Moonguard?
13Yup, Moon Guard
13Its an RP realm tho, bleh

And yes I know of that Fox guy you speak of LammyWolf just know him by his work not by his name.

Lapfox is his own personal record label, so to generalize, i say lapfox
I recently moved from Arathor to The Scryers to play with some friends...
13Is the one on Arathor Ally or Horde?
Seems to be more of a ERP realm at times PrincessMolestia, atleast if you belive the rumors.
Don't know, haven't played Arathor for awhile, after the guild was made
are mods only aloud to color text?
13Ah, okay.

Elfen Lied has a great story
thats why i like it silly philly
i like durarara
xaneco, did you watch it brony??
i gotta say its one of the few shows i felt for the characters
lucies my girl

no pun intended
lol
LOL
good one
._. I think i'd like elfen, only seen amvs for it though
its good

looks appealing
it starts out very slow
but its very sad, and hard, but very good
as most do
yay
i like sad
it does get really dark and sad
i like cack
*leave to go get food*

I like anything that makes you think... or makes you sad... or anything dark... so would i like elfen...?
yes
youd love Elfen
anypony rememeber reign????

0best. parody. ever http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4f9m4OYkCY&feature=feedf
it is graphic too tho :D
that was played tonight
I'd a weird insomniac human that stays up all night thinking...
i'm*
and then ponies
the opening for Elfen Lied sounds like your going to hell or something
they found their way into my heart
ha not really
lol
just sad serious and gloomy
Guh Reign, yeah I recall that pile.
wonderful, i'll watch it tonight
HORRIBLE SHOW ^
i have it on my ipod and as a ringtone on my phone
Lilium
NewDCD needs to add FMP to his saterday lineup.
raritys new dress =[
just read it
._.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k78BiUOPK0&has_verified=1
is it long...?
was cupcakes long?
ay, you read bittersweet...?
cupcakes was short
i was thinking mre the sequel
its ehh, depend on your point of view i guess
"There are at least 17 Leviathans currently known to exist on Tranquility. Three of them belong to the Mostly Harmless alliance"
i thought both cupcakes were long
u know whats my one of my fav openings in anime tho
>Mostly Harmless
>Own 3 Leviathans.
the Gantz opening is just sweet
badass
is Sparkle a surname
:O
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omkvD2kq1uc
i like the first soul eater opening
i hate Kai, but i liked dragon soul
the opening for it
i never watch soul eater but i like paper moon
._. i just remembered...
they are not that great of a ship Dashite, kind of hard to hit a moving target with a weapon firing rounds the size of busses.
one of my friends is planning on getting a tattoo of twilight sparkles cutie mark :D
soul eater and gurren lagen are my most recent
Rock the Dragon best DBZ opening lammy
True, but I just thought the idea of an alliance called "Mostly Harmless' having multiple titans kinda funny. :D
I think that Sparkle could be argued both ways - Pinkamena Dianne Pie seems to imply that the second part could be. But then, why isn't Rarity's name "Rarity Belle?"
lolwut?^
when i heard Rock the Dragon i felt like kicking someones ass lol
random conversation for no raisen
I WAS PUMPED
"hi" asked if sparkle was a surname
one of the best openings ever
maybe my chat thing is delayed

Remember that time I sung for the whole day and I was so tired?
What makes you think I could sing for 6 months?
You were wearing and changing props throughout the day though.

I always loved that derpy was there for no reason :P
and ah, ty Synros
I have no idea.
XD
5jsut noticed derpy
5mfw
lol
It is from ponybooru. "From anon 2 anon"
Pinkie_Pie: there's a 30k one rite? xD
i mean the poster
Not of that one. There is of the comic con poster.
/me loves the comic-con poster
even if they forgot Caramel :P
Was Dinky on the poster?
You know...I don't think she was
LEGASP! What if they don't make her canon? :(
5makes who canon?
Dinky
She wasn't canon the moment the Apple family came in different colors.
5link
of Dinky?
sec, while I open up photobucket :P
Madame le'flour is on the poster.
Lol
To the comic con poster?
dinky?
http://miburl.com/l3HG4C
Click it twice to zoom in to its real size
Its terrifying
And there is an even bigger one
Pinkie_Pie: the 30k one is truly terrifying
5i meant dinky
5...
sec, I have tons of pics up
30,000 x 19,824. oshitson
http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r118/ValtheJean/130506385337.png
I swear im gonna get that printed out Daz
5oooh her
My whole wall will be ponified.
Pinkie_Pie: same! just not yet :P
5never got it intom y head that she was named dinky
this one always makes me "D'AWWWWWWWWW"
http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r118/ValtheJean/130723373213.png
and yeah
Dinky comes from the fact that Derpy's canon name is Ditzy Doo
so it would be Ditzy Doo and Dinky Doo
this means either the father was a unicorn, or all 3 races contain the genetics for all 3 races. from what we've seen from families, though, this probably isn't the case. so ... dinky's father is a unicorn?
and then there are *some* people who speculate the non-ditzy doo pony that brought back the birds was her sister Daisy Doo
well, Lauren did say it was possible to have different species ponies
she did? i c.
which I prefer, just because I like keeping Dinky's father a mystery :P
it's just, all families we've seen are all the same races as parents / siblings
yeah, but that's probably an animation thing
and honestly, they probably didn't even consider it until someone asked them about dinky
i thought it worked well. : /. I liked to believe all genes for races were recessive, so it's 50 / 50 the race of the kid if bot hparents are different races.
and ofc 100% the kid will be the race of both parents if the parents are of teh same race
that's how I saw it
well, they'll probably never elaborate further on that note :P
it was probably more of a "Sure, let's throw them this so it's easier to say Ditzy is Dinky's mother" :P
:P
Im waiting for Rainbow_Dash to come online. All day if I have to
If I was in charge, I'd just say "whatever"
>yfw the first scene in S2 has Derpy and Dinky together
Ponychan will explode if that happens.
Twice.
can it do that? Can it explode twice?
I dont know D=
Okay...so let's say that Ponychan exploded...and then exploded again...and then
/me is shot
How do you do emotes like that?
just type /me
/me Pinkie Pie bounces in place
Yes...
thar you go :P
>mfw scene 1 has derpy and dinky, octavia, luna, dr whooves, a load of other popular characters (like Colgate) all there as official, non-reusable-background, characters.
ValtheJean: and then ponychan was a zombie
I think I would fangasm so hard Daz I'd be put into a coma
and lol
ikr
And then 4chan is infected
cannot WAIT for s02 soooo muuuuuch

well it's not pony related.. but it could be if he wanted to do that http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nm7wKc9VB8
Ugh. Forgot to leave this tab
Pinkie_Pie: mods stream. no mods streaming right now so we can't
BUT Pinkie_Pie you can still link a youtube url here
just like MeteorVenture did
Thats what I mean
How do I do it
link a URL
*est sry
just copy the url
I want to link an episode, and we can all watch it
go to a youtube vid and copy the address in your address bar Pinkie_Pie
you can check out anything by that dude.. it's all awesome
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpzYBlt-xOY&feature=related
it'll auto minify it

Its troll bird time.
hello everybrony

Val, watch it with me. >.>
>yfw I has a livestream playing Darksiders
Pinkie_Pie: you CAN however make a synctube account, where only youtube, but you man chat and syncronisedview vids
So basically I could make my own chat room and we could go there and watch it?
Sounds complicated..
it isn't
" you're a dog on a leash" "if i say bark, you bark" IMMA FUCKIN FUCK HIM UP NEXT TIME I SEE 'IM
very simple
and best of all the dude winks at you at the beginning and makes you feel all special
WAR
yes Pinkie_Pie you could
Ill do it for our entertainment..
I keep balance.
So, Valthejean, is Darksiders a game you consider okay?
considering I haven't played it I wouldn't know
want to see gameplay?
I suppose, sure
alright.
What episode do you guys wanna watch?..
Wait.. Darksiders? I remember seeing that
if it's about people driving around in cars and not being able to see correctly i'm not watching it
lol
Darksiders is a vidyagame
Lolwut

AKA the blindspotters
i presume

but that was funny pinkie
I see a rainbow pony, haha that was priceless
Val, I tried to make a synchtube room for us
AllisZero: Obviously you should post ponies :P
But it wouldnt load the video
I can make a room if you want
it works for me
Sure
it's alright Pinkie, I've been watching derma's stream for a bit
Derma?
Dermathil
Link? Lol
let's see
Well, I post ponies while at work
(second, trying to find it)
I got an ad that says "Got herpes? We do too!"
really...what
When I'm home I have a hard time getting myself to procrastinate for long
http://www.livestream.com/dermathil?t=167311
lol
I've had that ad pop up too shad
http://miburl.com/GkQnbb
I'm guessing that's on memebase?
errr, demotivational
I remember the most ironic video/banner ad combination I've seen
*facehoof*
also ohai Purple`Prose, I don't think I saw you log on :P

http://images.4chan.org/gif/src/1314457828153.gif
Haha I love this gif
I have been looking for that gif. You are my hero
I get a 4chan message for some reason >.<
http://miburl.com/FrMkOr
Above: Not for the faint of heart
lol
Because it is a 4chan thread
don't think I've seen that one before
http://images.4chan.org/gif/src/1314425524587.gif
well fine then, keep to your 4chan nonsense :P
I didn't want to see it anyway :P

Secret Brush FUn
Allis
Is Mibbit different for any of you today? It seems to happen to me every so often.
Nooo Fluttershy
I dont think you can link images directly from 4chan.
I'm just going to stop clicking pinkie's links for fear of my sanity :P
Ah, gotcha.
http://miburl.com/5hnPD1
Aw.. I promise I wont post any more Secret Brush Fun
XD
That's a good one though
Allis, it still wont work
D=
She comes in so happy
Baws
/me attempts to rip Boondock Saints *again*, since it didn't want to work last time.
And I did the wrong side, anyway. Ripped the full-screen instead of wide-screen.
lol
Val
yessums?
I have to regain your trust. Here is an exceptional comic, but you have probably already seen it
lol
http://miburl.com/QI5pU2
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
NOT
hahaha, oh god, now I feel like a complete ass
THE COMIC
NNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
oh god there goes my will to live for the rest of the weekend
you're forgiven seeing as you weren't there for when we were discussing this comic
._.
but I actually hate that comic with the force of a thousand suns >.<
Whats wrong with the comic..
AllisZero: Really? You mean old happy Dash reflecting on her life is that depressing?
well, Allis tears up any time he sees it. I myself find it WAY too cheesy
it also reminds me of the completely unnecessary love for RD
when she is the most single dimensional character
The part that makes me tear up in it is the missing man formation.
/me Pinkie Pies hair deflates
Oh.. Ok.. Ill find a more happy thought
>.>
lol, me sowwy pinkie :P
pro tip: I love Caramel. But I hate shipping with every bone in my body
mfw I have to actually add that disclaimer because nobody DRAWS my favorite character outside of shipping >: *
@FreezeFrame I don't know exactly why, but anything that reflects on the past gets me depressed, sad or not.
>: (*
Hi Pinkie.
Hi
http://miburl.com/cbyJdK
I've got a weak spot for that kind of stuff, always have
Say, which of your friends would you pick to plan a party if you couldn't?
How about that one?
That one is so much d'awwww
yeah, that one I like better
Yep
What do you mean, "If I couldnt"?
Oh
I read it wrong
...
Berry Punch
A Cross and an Arrow
>=D
lol
silly filly, that's not how you spell Caramel :P
And thats how equestria was unmade.
Of course.
Wait
Not Berry Punch
But if it had to be another member of the elements of harmony, who do you think would best fill your shoes?
Bubble Berry, is it?
Rainbow Dash, she is the most energetic.
Ah. So Bubble Berry if it could be anyone, and rainbow Dash otherwise
That's cool
Berry Bubble *is* another Element, though. :P
Yeah
Just look at him
http://miburl.com/LKeaDF
Hullo
hello maxaminus
I meant other than laughter
Okay, Firefox's App Tabs are the best new feature ever.
So You'd choose Loyalty, RD
Seems fair. From what I understand, she helped you make that party for Gilda
I can actually maintain two seperate google logins with them.
Yes, lots and lots of super duper pranks!
lol
/me <-- Sucks at imitating Pinkie Pie
Seems Gilda's not a prankster, though
It's fine, though
If I had to pick any of the Mane Six other than Pinkie, I'd actually pick Rarity. It'd be a different sort of party from a Pinkie Party, and I think the change of pace would be awesome.
/me says we can't all be star actors
http://miburl.com/sQ3nrq
no comment
Actually, just go here to see them
http://mlpfanart.wikia.com/wiki/Male_versions_of_the_main_cast_of_characters
Let's see, put berry bubble and pinkie pie together and you get the end of the world. put rarity and elusive together and you get love-struck ponies
I love Berry Bubble's Gala suit
It's just so.... right.
Read the fanfic A cross an a Arrow Barry
Its awesome
Put Applejack and Cousin Jay-Jay together and you get family. Put Fluttershy and Butterscotch together and you get... what do you get?
Find out in the fanfic
Its about the mane 6 getting sent to an alternate universe, where all the genders are swapped
hai
hello decappony
Put Rainbow Dash and Rainbow Blitz together and you get rivals. And we have yet to see what happens when Twilight and Dusk get together
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/06/story-on-cross-and-arrow.html
nerd rage?
Ugh, the MKVs I'm making with MakeMKV aren't working in Media Player Classic
I've read that story
I'm up to date
You get Neurosis :P
lol
its a good story, interesting plot
Nice one, Freeze Frame
Hi DecapPony
hey brownies
Plot, you say?
ohai robotpinkie
At least they'll work in Windows Media Player
what up robotpinkie
yo ValtheJean, DecapPony
I just went pony shopping
oh?
what did thou unveil?
Orly?
Not much, just want all the first wave G4 ponies :P
http://miburl.com/8PaVxJ
Do you mean that plot Decap?
Dont ask me how I found that image
when they have show realistic models, I'll buy them :P
lol
Nice one, Pinkie
http://miburl.com/XmjaAd
lol, I see it linked all the time on ponychan
In fact, that one sparkle on Twilight looks like a censor. Just saying
http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=110734041360
$300 for a plushie? no fucking thanks
I prefer being able to buy bread
http://miburl.com/ijFReZ then have a picture
I'm interested to see how close they can get the toys to the cartoon. The cartoon ponies tend to have non-euclidian dimensions
The most amazing plushie in the world
Decap, im saving that picture for later use.
Nice, Decap
I like the rainbow censor
I remember seeing a non-porn, pretty well done humanized Mane Six picture.
humanized ponies freak me the fuck out for some reason
same here
They're weird, yes.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBWW1RT2BGQ
De Magicz ^
I'm doing my own version of humanized Mane 6 characters.
Might take me a few months but I want to get it done.
Well, wait
k
well I can't draw for my life so no fanart here
:P

The things people will do
Oh the horror, the horror
I know what im going to do
Im going to download the mp3 of a cupcakes read along
And im gonna apply the g major effect to it
...
Haven't listened to anything other than FiM music for the past two weeks
the "G Major" meme makes music theory nerds like me shake my head
lol, so long as you never link it to me, be my guest Pinkie :P
It's a funny meme, but pick a better meme
*Name
http://miburl.com/1s209a
because when I heard somebody mention "Winter Wrap Up in G Major" I thought they changed up the key
OMG WANT DECAPPONY
> You will never go for a walk with baby Twilight
sorry princess molestia already took her
and named her george
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

Oh man
I read the entire thing
And I had a huge smile on my face the whole time, DecapPony
Ok.. I think making cupcakes into g major might be a bit above my editing skills
Nvm
It would be for the good of equestria that I dont do it anyway
as did I
Also, my brain hurts now Decap
:|
Alright I'm tired of sitting here, gonna be afk for a while. Later folks

7apply to become a moderator?
Lol
7and pink is taken i'm afraid

hey Sathi
7heya
I've got 99 moonrocks and an aeiou ain't one.
Oh well, 99% of the things I say is posting more videos anyway
except dark red and light grey :P
7dark red is taken
I managed to get a livestream running.
Basically, every color's already taken I think.
lol oh okay, every color except light grey
http://miburl.com/q2CLD5
Wait, I think Light gray isn't taken
>mfw we have over 17 million mods
Light gray is hard to read, isnt it?
Light grey looks about the same as white.
/me says make ramen

ramen it is :P
I wub Teriyaki chicken
Is it possible to add more colours Sathi?
Man, I'm seriously debating learning to decorate cakes JUST to make a Fluttershy cake for my birthday.
You could just add a lighter shade of pink, which would fit better anyway.
Lol
bah....now I can't decide any more >.<
7We are working on a solution
Flip a coin ValTheJean
http://miburl.com/ToArya my new favorite hero

That was very heroic

I sent an application, but im not sure how much time I need to spend in the chat
7well how much time you have for ponies?
Sathi: What is that even from? That looks familiar
so are the LotR movies the theatrical version or extended?
http://miburl.com/93oTX2
7extended
I have been here for 2-4 hours already, and im still having fun.
If it is like this every day, I could spend quite a bit of time with you people

Has anyone noticed how he seems to be sort of tired in the show?
Nobody has the right!
Like it wore him out to put that bag on Applejacks back.
I guess he was just sad
But he seems like a laid back guy if anything
*shrug* who knows?
im wondering how he got hurt before applebucking season
Big Macintosh?
Yeah

lolwut?
Not I!
that doesn't mean we WANT to see it again

7DONT POST IT
It doesnt mean we all need to see it again.
No, and please don't make me see it.
*trololol*
7posting is instant ban
http://miburl.com/7QmrYU
Sathi, for the love of god, chill dude.
^ That's funny tho.
Yeah, its fine as long as it doesnt actually show anything explicit.
http://miburl.com/ab9udn Have some GIF!
It's in the rules, it's just best that everyone knows that.
7Silvermane just telling the rules, secondly i'm a girl
when in doubt of whether or not something is questionable, I've found the best solution is to just not post it
isn't worth the ban
in soviet equestria.....
PONIES DANCE YOU!
*awkward silence*
shhhhh
I am well aware of your gender, Sathi. Dude is an androgynous term. Or is it asexual term... non-gender biased? I need a thesaurus

die potato!
I've been here for 2 months now, i know better than to post porn. Hence the *trololol*
to be fair
the warning came before the *trololo*
^
Generally, you dont post anything that would be offensive to minors in any chat without a 18+ confirmation.
its not offensive if they dont know what it means...
So no posts about best pony, then. Damn.
I'm just gonna go sit in my channel and wait for someone... harg, this is just silly now
Sathi, wanna see something funny?
call of duty sucks
Is anyone offended yet?
nope
Phew
AllisZero: OMG U R TEH LIEK NEWB U JUZ SUCK OMG NEWB!
I play it occasionally
but just for zombies
multiplayer blows
*shivers* I can't believe I actually typed all that out
TF2
I like playing through the SP campaign of almost all shooters
im emotionally scared. CoD was the last game my grangran gave me before she died...
But I hate multiplayer with a passion
BF2 multiplayer is awesome
multiplayer is a ragefest of complaining children
:(
in cod
My dad died while I was watching transformers.. So I dont watch that either..
not realy, i agree
Its a shame, I kinda liked the first one
http://miburl.com/C6bZS1
I think the Mane 6 are all pretty much equally awesome ponies.
Anyone offended now?
http://miburl.com/YS448X Spike is awesome
i dont see why prople obsess over buying a 'new' game so they can play multyplayer, wich is almost a copy of the previous game
pressed backspace and went to previous page
I hate that D:
/me rips his shirt.
HOW.
DARE.
YOU.
so what did I miss
I actually bought a game while out pony shopping, for once.
Something else traumatized Allis
Im not sure which image it was this time
Nothing big though
k
was it spike?
RobotPinkie said all Mane 6 are equal in awesomeness
rainbow dash is about 20% cooler
I HAD TO DO IT
I HAD TO
I'm sorry, AllisZero, I didn't pay attention at sensitivity training :(
Its all about opinion.
Anything more and it always turns out to be a pointless flame war
Eh
favorite pony gang wars
lol, that was a pretty good video
I loved that video :D
You see the problem with people is that everyone loves confrontation
NO I DON'T ALLIS I ARGUE YOUR POINT
as do I
I dunno, I don't have a problem with people saying who they think is best pony.
http://miburl.com/kqyVSr
For fuck's sakes, we're mostly adults here watching MLP, I think we can all agree that we've got enough confrontation coming from the naysayers to get us all to stick together and accept others' favorite ponies!
I mean really, who cares?
I love everypony
Me too.
Me three.
Honestly there isn't a character in the show I don't like
that's not how you spell Caramel :P *trollface*
same here
I... don't love Prince Blueblood, I'm sorry :(
I'm not exactly fond of Scotaloo but
OGOD BLUEBLOOD
Well, shit. Ok, you got me there.
*rage*
I know you guys love him just as much as Twilight Sparkle, but...
trololol
NOW THAT'S A CHARACTER WE CAN ALL AGREE TO HATE
I actually like blueblood >.<
http://miburl.com/cWU6gi They crossed the beams.....
Oh god.. Here it comes
I love luna and she only had like 3 seconds in season 1
http://miburl.com/ieYy4e
FLAME WAAAAAAARS! *dons hazmat suit*
Let's forget our differences in regards to our favorite ponies and embrace what makes us alike... our hate for Blueblood.
i dont see how blueblood is related to celestia
:(
he isnt
@NoOne: He's a very very very very very distant nephew
hes a professional troll
He's a pony
trollestria is best troll
Allis, lets not. There is no point to express hate over anypony, and it will only make us argue.
Even if Blueblood is a prick
but I LIKE arguing!
Blueblood is kind of 40-or-so branches away from the princesses, but he is a nephew
:D
But but but... rarityyy
BUT I THOUGHT YOU WANTED ARGUUUUUIIIING
I want laughter. Go.. Now.. Find funny pictures
THAN WHY THE HAY IS HE....aww nvm
Dermathil: How did we find out about that though? Is it canon?
Or else, ill break the 4th wall
it was from word of god

Have some Derpy in socks
Been a REAL long while since I heard bout it tho
lol
I'm very certain it was Faust herself
Ah, I see. I was interested in the whole Nephew thing
she's doin it wrong
...or is she?
I may or may not have the pic related to it
<O<
http://miburl.com/EVPhFf
lemme browse through my faust comments folder
...yeah, actually she is...
That is me leaving to come find you
maby everypony wlse is wrong
http://miburl.com/4zjCA6 me watching ponies for the first time
Actually, I think it was saying that Blueblood is Celestia's nephew forty times removed or something.
http://miburl.com/fLLI6A
And that is me finding you
O HAI PINKIE!
Dat 4th wall
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lpiedgidJ51qincmao1_500.jpg
And that's Lyra in socks
orly?
/me starts to hum the duck tales theme
No, I'm lying, it's Zecora
luna is best with socks
http://miburl.com/9rgXKA
where did this whole ponies in socks thing start
:|
I HAVE NO IDEA!
Should I go spend 50-60 bucks of my own money to get my bro's PC back in action so we can play some Co-op together?
co-op what?
co-op on what
I'm honestly bored out of my mind and don't want to waste the rest of the weekend
if its portal 2 than hay ya
Dungeon Siege 3
Anypony here play Roblox or Runescape?
Nope.avi
i played runescape....a long time ago....
Portal 2 is awesome.
I quit runescape AGES ago
Any good Ps3 co-op games you guys know of, then?
no
I used to play it alot, but it got boring after a while. I log in every once in a while to talk to my friends
not ps3 only
360>ps3
well I have an xbox so idk
PC>360
INB4FLAMEWAR
I don't think he was asking for exclusives... :P
um, nope NoOne.
Well, anything really. I played Army of 2
Flame war imminent..
Why.. NOONE
That was entertaining enough
PS3 can be cross-platform with PC. that is all.
Resident Evil 5 was kinda fun in coop, I thought
XBOX AND PLAYSTATION 3 ARE NOT BETTER THAN EITHER
and this is the only argument you will ever need.
much better than single player...
ITS ALL PERSONAL OPINION
^
Love and Tolerance for everyone's favorite ponies
oh god what have i done?! IM SORRY!
But when it's video-games, find a trench
I like PS3 the most, but I don't think it's better than 360. You can like something and still be objective about it.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tk-cziBPTNU&feature=related
Flame war is over, watch quest.
Nowai
HOW ABOUT WE WATCH SUM PONIES
http://miburl.com/yxRk2G
If one of you will set up a synchtube room, we can watch ponies.
I saw that one
I got synchtube to work and I have a playlist with all 26 episodes
Funny shit
^_^
Link?
O HAI THERE SCOOTALOO!
7 5hrs left ;)
I guess there's some more time for Time Crisis, then.
7pre-pre stream will go up in 2hrs
waddat
o:
What will be in that Sathi?
Music and other random stuff?
play 'Pinkies Lie' on a loop
7non youtube requests :)
we can has MLP mentally advanced in pre pre stream?
all will be good
awww
btw, very interesting article here: http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/112562-Microsoft-Doesnt-Want-Sonys-Sloppy-Seconds
no pony swag?
Sathi, can I ask for Season two of DuckTales?
Sounds fun
Wow, nice. So Microsoft is hanging itself, pretty much?
ducktales about daffy duck in space?
Ah, no, now I get what he means
NOPE
This Means Xbox can have less games than PS3
I live in michigan, no disasters here
Not really a massive surprise, Dermathil... though the one big XBLA title that I'd want on PSN is Shadow Complex
Im in South Carolina, but we havent even gotten any rain yet.
NO MORE ARGUING ABOUT GAME SYSTEMS
...and that's not happening.
WI, it nice here :D
Who's arguing?
Shad, link to that Synchtube room? We can watch that until the stream comes online
i just dont like that the ps3 i have cant lay ps2 games
that is all
so, bigger games library in Playstation, add to that pc-crossplatform compatibility in Portal-2's case (with BOTH PC and Mac)
/me has a livestream
PEOPLE PLEASE CALM DOWN ABOUT GAMING!
Does it have ponies?
I don't really like that either, NoOne, but eh... I don't really want European PS2 games anyway.
not atm, Pinkie.
I set it up today
AND WHAT
IS WRONG
I might just put first season on shuffle for a while
WITH EUROPEAN PS2 GAMES?! D<
hey VioletVanilla
http://miburl.com/T2swex
Our games are just as good as your games D:
Helo RobotPinkie~ :3
lets watch 9:32:25 of ponies!
lol VioletVanilla, European PS2 games are often slowed down by about 15% or so
Slowed down? .-.
I'm European, so that kind of makes it difficult for me to get the best versions of games....
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW_w5HZtp64&feature=related
PAL is 50hz, NTSC is 60hz
btw, I has begun a game of Darksiders LP in my livestream.
oblivion ftw
I'm European too o:
Yes
i want skyrim
I want skyrim to.
/me has 40-or-so other games he can LP
when will the show star at 7 right
I have it preordered for pc
Oh well, yeah, that is true. . .
Unless there's a 60hz option, the game has been slowed down
7pm EST time Guyandsam

lol
Goonswarm was an alliance that pretty much tried to take over the whole game.
And they pretty much did
Everyone hates them
isn't it still around though?
This is the game im talking about
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aegK7n7C5Z8
Yeah, they are I think
Not as powerful as they used to be
i like the dominion trailer
I can fly a t3 ship on eve.
I just dont play it any more. Its more of a job than a game in most cases
Still, its epic
i can fly a BIG PIECE OF BS
A battleship?
ya
Lol
wanted to get to super carrier but...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evD5xqIHLmI&feature=related
A super carrier isnt something you can really get by yourself..
ya, and all the corps i was in kinda sucked
If you have good enough skills your alliance will pay for one for you
Assuming you are trusted
And wont do something stupid and get it blown up
ya but its finding a good alliance that is the hard part
Hello again

Course not, TTS.
i thought there was meant to be another LoTR today around this time
SilverMane, dont go by my word to much. Im not sure if they really are or not
I still remember back when the survival thing came out for L4D1, and we accidentally figured out how to last forever when I charged at the tank yelling: "FOR PONY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

But Sathi, I dont really get what you mean by cafeteria.
/me 3throws a frag grenade at TheTrollside

what cafateria?
You said it right after I posted the link to this
3again*
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEOtMLQMRHM
I think she means the Lobby
3*Boom*
Is that "Cafeteria"
?

Valthejean, PM
its the one w/ demonic food
fuck it ill just be silvermane and come back form the dead xD
remember silver?
So you just made her to scared to click on it..?
-.-
remember i shot you down?
twice?
probably the coolest part of FO:NV early on was in Goodsprings, when you have the entire town of 8 or 9 people fighting against a large unit of bandits
it just felt like a real firefight would
dude silvermane
bye bye TheTrollSide
those bandits are piss easy
3Wait...whats the evil video called?
Follow the Sun?
yes they were TTS, but it still felt great
that was it Dermathil
its 8 or 9 vs 6 or 7
oh, and the be creative one.
although its awesome when you have the mercenary pack though
that one was hillarious
let's never be creative again
Decap
"Green isn't a creative color"
lol
You made it so Sathi wont consider the derpy standby.
Why?
3WHAT WAS THAT VIDEO!?
Green isn't your color is stuck in my mind now
Why did you mention that video?!
3ER.....what were those TWO videos?
what the movie lobby video?
/me 3wants to creep the fuck out of his brother.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEOtMLQMRHM
That
Follow the sun and the Be Creative one
Follow the sun is the lobby one
3That and the Be creative one
It needs to be played before the LoTR movie starts
It would be fitting
And somewhat funny
3Eeeeyup
3And creepy
wait what video did i mention?
ITS NOT CREEPY D=
Decap
yes?
denied_existence fallout 3 music is not creepy at all and its just derpy standing there
3NOT THAT ONE FOOL
Dont mention the video again
The standings of the derpy video have been butchered enough already
Needs less epic music.
BITCH PLEASE
yeah i wont
So.. Who do I talk to to get that played as the last thing before the movie?
Denied_Existence, the Derpy Standby was not an evil video.
LINK THE VIDEO
3I MEAN THE TWO FROM LAST NIGHT FOOL
Suddenly Denied_Existence became a NIGHT-ELF MOHAWK

3NoOne SirSprinkles has a...*thing* for SeaPonies
BACON AND APPLEJACK
inb4 they're eaten in S2
i agree with watching the room
im scared
I like how "Thanks Sea ponies!" is expressed in two frames of animation.
Pinkie_Pie, my ^ was to Interior_gummy watching the room
dear god...Sprinkles is just going to play us non-stop G3.5 isn't he?
"The room"?
watching the room, in a room, while in a chat room...
Still dont see the problem.
6Haven't seen this one yet.
Love this song!
:)
ADD

Sprinkles
Oh fuck, you're telling me I missed sea ponies?
What if it is a screamer, or something else sinister/
I tried to click off the ad on the video...

Now I'm a sad pony :(
i vote for gic
3green isn't a creative color

0so, never watched g1
0is it any good?
3I am having MOTHER II flashbacks here.
OH GOD NO
/me is feeling this song
0i've heard mixed
Sea ponies are impervious to bullets. Shit.
Damn the high notes are radaling my headphones
from what I understand, the community is a bit divided on G1
/me is rotting from the core
we can all agree that G2-3.5 sucks ass
but some really like G1
6Sea Ponies: Your hate only makes them stronger
G1 is hardcore but still targeted girls with the intent of toys
3This song
3Reminds me of MOTHER II
7What is this song?
I only saw the pilot, and the villains were awesome (before they all died/turned into humans)
7lalala
3Or it might have been MOTHER I
/me 7is happy
0isn't g4 also partially about toys?
6I'm trying to show things I haven't shown before, for the most part.
/me 7just pre-ordered SAM BFE
http://miburl.com/l9vugE
SAM BFE?
3Dat link
silly interior_gummy, G4 is about FUCKING AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!
/me is some mixture of every emotion
Well yeah. Think about Twilight's balloon.
7Sam is awesome
0SirSprinkles: like pinkie pie tlt uolliac?
7and old-school
Denied, why do you always say that?
I have no idea what it is, Sathi :(
What the hay is this song?
7:D
hai sammy!
I'm surprised though, that the Elements of Harmony never got turned into toy jewelry.
3I don't remember Pinkie_Pie
6Repeatedly suggesting a video only reduces the chances of me playing it.
Holly highnote.
6It's like spamming the chat, and I'm not a fan of it.
0i stop now, ja
Challenge: Turn your volume all the way up
what if we keep suggesting Sea Ponies? *trollface*
>=P
Then should we suggest sea ponies?
3Also DecapPony, VAAAARRRRYYYY interesting

0'*meme
Operation happy Bic Mac is on
This movie's songs = win
Is this grease?
6A Goofy Movie
I see
Come back, this
:D
A Goofy Movie? I dont remember this song..
ahhh right
Oh the memories
which, I will say, was surprisingly better than I was expecting
It's near the beginning
first song of the movie, I recall it now
Hmm
0Pm-ed you, Pinkie_Pie
Back from watching Cowboys and Aliens.
That movie was awesome.
IMO
I second that
I third that
3I...*yawn*...am tired for some reason...hmmmmm
Young fluttershy was so small
Speak for yourself
3Gonna grab some soda
I never get tired
my feet are still cold
blanket pls
Nah! Ninjas and Aliens was better. lol
My feet are also cold.
That's the sequel though
3*Crack* *Psssssssssst* *Slurp*
OH I MEAN MY HOOVES
0theory: fluttershy is the oldest, and the rest are the same age except twilight, who's a year younger
Wear socks
I juts finished watching 127 Hours for like the fourth time, so I'm feeling super happy right now.
Hello all, this is my first time here
BUT WE DON'T NORMALLY WEAR CLOTHES
hello JakeCake
sit back and enjoy the ponies :P
3IDK
But ponies wear socks
Hey Jakecake
nope
I will
Glad to meet you all
Hi JakeCake
who started that ponies wearing socks thing anyway
ALso first time here. /wave
Socks and saddles
I don't like this song...but Fluttershy
hello Amino
and hey Amino, too
6AppleJack is older than the others, since she was the last of her age to get her Cutie Mark.
3Hi, have some free ponies Jakecake:http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/facethumbs/6.jpg
dat cheerilee face
Cheerilee confirmed for most awesomeface pony
PLS
You can get cutie marks at differnt ages Sprinkles
are you forgetting rainbow dash so awesome face?
*different
6I know, HMP.
yeah, but she also said she was the last in her class to get a cutie mark
which implies she wasn't in the other's classes
3http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/facethumbs/175.jpg
is it me or is the vid/stream jumpy
Rainbow dash can't beat Cheerilee in an awesomeface contest.
It's a little jumpy for me
0also, rd and fluttershy went to a different school
it's doing that for me too noone
It's not you
6I'm saying that since she was the last of her age group to get her CM, which was stated, she'd be older, since timeline-wise, Rarity got her CM after AJ did.
fluttershy is a year older than pinkie
0or she was just lying to make apple bloom feel better
confirmed
6Yes, that's confirmed.
Fluttershy is a tree.
She'd like to be a tree.
i'd like to be a tree
3Fluttertry
If you like Pokemon you'll like the video I got the audio from here.
3Tree*
