this is the same town that thinks Trixie actually beat her competitors, I think that there was no easy way to determine this contest :P
man those background ponies must have really boring lives
she only cheated in 3 or 4 rounds > won by 10
sour grapes
DASH > ALL
yesh.
He was in the background
We seriously need this show in Sweden, like pronto

0any one botheed by the element of "loyalty" is also the element of cheating?
*nods*
Mustard.. =3
hotdogs?

or mayo?
Pickles are good!
Pinkie likes them doggies slippery :3
whoa

Cheapness

Loyalty and cheating aren't mutually exclusive
Pinkie should do commentary for everything.

You all have noticed that Angel doesn't like Spike, right?
FLUTTERHOOVY
The animals, the animals!~
Fuck I'm high, let's disturb the animals.
14Buzzards that can really buzz!

TGMM that was good.

lol
The animals! The animals!
The Buzzard That Really Buzzez
BUZZARDS THAT REALLY BUZZ
And they all hate you Fluttershy.
YOU'RE... GOING TO LOOVVEE MEEEEE!!!
0Wait...Greenjays?
buzzards, someone didn't do the research
3Fluttershy and Dash have the best reasons in my opinion...and MAAAABBBYYYEEE pinkie

ARE YOU CRAZY
8OATMEAL!
Derpy thinger.
Awww that whine was adorable
4Applejack deserves the ticket. She was there when Twilight got the tickets from Celestia, and she has the only non personal reason for going (wants to make money for her family)
We need a Gumbow Dash fic. >_>
go on shoo
fluttershy can just go to the zoo
Fluttershy has the least selfish reason.
0 201 to 151! UNACCEPTABLE!
GummyDash shipping
Twilight should just pick whoever she thinks she'll have the most fun with.
isnt money normally a selfish pursuit?
4Fluttershy only wants to go for herself
gummytwist is best ship
4Pinkie wants to go for herself
desperate noms
4RD wants to go for herself
0THE NUMBER'S DROPPING! RUN TO DA CHOPPA
really good reasons
rarity has the worst reason
That was atimmy moment
ham: have you seen best night ever? she's arguably the most selfish of all.
Rarity wants to get laid
4Rarity wants to go for herself
she should just got by herself
fluttershy is best pony
EXTRA CRISPY
4AJ wants to go for her family
she and spike
spike is best, he doesnt want to go
twlight was going to invite applejack first, danced with applejack when she got them.
and the money :P
CAJ, also ineffective...
You should give me the ticket!
pinkie isn't selfish, she throws parties and bakes for everyone

Because in my dream I actually told a Pony "I wish you were real." They said "I know" and began to cry.

She wasn't canon the moment the Apple family came in different colors.
5link
sec, while I open up photobucket :P
Lol
To the comic con poster?
http://miburl.com/l3HG4C

http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r118/ValtheJean/130723373213.png
and yeah
which I prefer, just because I like keeping Dinky's father a mystery :P
it's just, all families we've seen are all the same races as parents / siblings
yeah, but that's probably an animation thing
that's how I saw it
well, they'll probably never elaborate further on that note :P
:P
If I was in charge, I'd just say "whatever"
Twice.
can it do that? Can it explode twice?
I dont know D=
Okay...so let's say that Ponychan exploded...and then exploded again...and then
/me is shot
How do you do emotes like that?
just type /me
/me Pinkie Pie bounces in place
Yes...
thar you go :P
