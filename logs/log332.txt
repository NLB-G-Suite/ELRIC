brony buddies RAWRity, theres always that
Watership Down is the best children's book at least.

Watership Down isn't a children's book by any stretch... and the movie is also not really for kids.

/me glances into IngloriousPony89's mind
MEH....that's nothing
Green Day...
No Cavy.
No.
BUCK Green Day in the FACE.
Go to bed SleepyChicken.
D=
I have mixed feelings about Green Day
there it goes!
it's back up!
/me causes emangamer to go insane
on the one hand, they suck
and running BEAUTIFUL!
You're too young to be staying up this late.
WTH
Green Day can go die in a hole.
on the other hand, they really suck
/me just sits in a corner, silently
IngloriousPony89: what if I ALREADY am insane?
they gotta dig the hole!
Then your more insane emangamer
i cant wait untill they do my request. it will be awesome.
IngloriousPony89: IMPOSSIBRU~~~~
RAWRity: just because you don't like it, doesn't mean it's utter crap.
1,3dari, ghosties, or luna would be who you'd want to talk to for anything like that
otakon: according to RAWRity it does...he is god of the universe apparently
DO MINE!
otakon: I'm not saying it's crap. I'm just saying that they can to die in a hole.
what happened to normal people asking me to play Free Bird...
ah
Well it is POSSIBRU because it just happened emangamer!
what consoles do you have?
ok idk though i need to get some more casholas first
well that's different
those were the good times...
1,3hehe :)
IngloriousPony89: LIES...it's all secret and li...wait what?
hey vevryone! Do you like waffles?
brb
YEAH!
1,3just having more people around makes this place fun
SleepyChicken: yes sleep...when you awake you will be a different scootachichen...In fact you will be Sweetiedictionary.
Do you like pancakes?
See, when I say "It sucks" I'm really saying "I personally feel it sucks, but others are welcom to have differing and contrary opinions."
YEAH
Better safe than sorry, emangamer
:D
do you like frenchtoast?
SleepyChicken: come with me....
(God I hope you get that reference emangamer)
YEAH
NU
it's just that I tend to not like being that verbose with my insults.
Eh... noothing else to do...
I ain't comin' with no dictionary!
Video I just put on #Vinyl_Scratch is the best Skyrim video to date, probably.
Just the 360
SleepyChicken: but this...this is your DESITINY
HA
Buck destiny!
THE FUN HATH BEEN DOUBLED
buck it right in the flank!
SleepyChicken: nopony can buck destiny...not even Apple Jack
YEAH IN THE FLANK
mmm, flank
In there plot?
lol
So to clear things up: I feel tha green day is a shallow group of musicians that put more thought into their "statements" than their music, and have been living off their success in the early 90's for years.
theres always a plot
its a good system :)
Can I say something about destiny? Screw destiny! If this evil thing comes we'll fight it, and we'll keep fighting it until we whoop it. 'Cause destiny is just another word for inevitable and nothing's inevitable as long as you stand up, look it in the eye, and say 'You're evitable!
how long is this VID?!
dat critic RAWRity
dat FLANK
but you are free to feel differently, and have a lively but civil debate with me about it.
luna and celestia...LIKE A FAUST
SleepyChicken: you can't fight destiny, you can always try but you will always fail. Just look at the greek myths.
though, not tonight, as I need to go to bed to prepare for haulling trees now.
screw the Greek myths
Most musicians anymore are only worried about theit own success.
Yeah I like it...but I like how the PS3 is free to play online
Homer can go die in a hole
SuperBrony64: can we watch the stars will aid in her escape?
their*
LIKE A FAUST
it is?
0.0
:O SleepyChicken
1,3ugh, random popsicle is a green one >.<
I thought it was a paid service
O_O
SleepyChicken: search your feelings you know...YOU KNOW WHATno I'm not making that reference
Greek Mythology is AWESOME
good night everypony! see you all tomorrow (Warning, I may be in a very foul mood.)
*Waits patiently for my 3rd video to go up*

RAWRity: I say old chap, I do hope that you sleep most stupendeously.
10,02Going to take a break for a little bit and put up a playlist
Night RAWRity

PinkiesRevenge /please/ stop allcapsing
/me bobs head

SleepyChicken: you will figure out why his flank is sore though

DJ ALEX.S IS THE BEST DJ EVER
^
Everybody please stop with the capslock
'Just ask SuperBrony64 about last night' using this as evidence for the sexual offences trial
ENOUGH with the allcaps. Its REALLY annoying
guys how IS a streamer picked?
OKAY THEN Bro
MFW we still have a bunch of n00bies here
soon, Fleur will slowly morph into Wrek
Then why do you use allcaps LC? :P
Ohai LadyCanary, didn't know you were still here.
Fleur+LadyCanary=Wrek
What this? Fleur is evolving!
but I haven't seen any games for the PS3 that id want to play
I need noms
Pssh
dun dun dun dun dun dun
/me picks up a boot
nomnomnom
Ohai LadyCanary :3 ,3
maybe the only one would be sly cooper 4
Skyrim dun derped
hey hey hey LadyCanary
/me takes the boot from Fleur "please, nopony needs to be hurt"
havent had a chance to try the rachet and clank series
/me gets ready to throw it at next allcap
stay outta mai shed?
My computer is still derping. Still only a white screen
im playing MW3 and listening to this at the same time.... LIKE A FAUST
1,3trust is the first thing
Fleur: at least use a sack of oranges, at least those dont leave bruises.
sounds epic james
MW3? :O :O
oh, it is.
why she no reply to me ;______;
JamesIsABrony: like a fanboy.
Ugh, CoD
I need a catch phrase: how about "Lozzle Cakes?"
1,3then having a good connection, reliability, and the hardware to back it up
pshhh MW3 it's all about SKyrim bro
brb, committing seppuku
You can get Playstation points though to buy games...PS3's have enormous hard drives
I had one but gave it to my sister
XD
who didnt reply to you SleepyChicken?
hm
dat Samurai
Broooooowwwwwwwwwwwwwwnnn shooooooooters...................................
lolwut?
bro, skyrim is good and all, but its only single player. QUICKSCOPING FTW
wow... Fleur you are going to hate KetaminaDianePie aren't you?
you gave your ps3 to your sister?
Yeah more and more games are offical Xbox licensed and only for Xbox
all right, so is it move the blade from left to right?
:O
Ace Combat is superior to over-hyped and over-rated CoD
or right to left?
mw3 got so boring so quickly.
what kind of software is required?
good god.... JamesIsABrony there are so many things with that statement
because real life is brown donchakno?
hmmm...
pfft it's all about MW2 quickscoping
Fleur hates with an iron Shoe
Yeah when I got my 360...not enough room lol
MW3 Rage: BEGIN!
SleepyChicken dont do it! D:
rawr
1,3there are a few different types you can use to stream
/me slices blade
/me misses
SleepyChicken: dont do it maaaaaaan
I'm all like "Is that like "touch fuzzy, get dizzy"
/me removes the sword from SleepyChicken hands "BAD CHICKEN"
ITS all about COD 4 QUCIK SCOPING BEEEEYACH
ffffffffffffff-
Then I was right :D

(\ emantrollslayer.
Shizuka: was that A critical reference?
do you two live in the same house?
13i... don't know?

1,3not sure, I think each service has their own software
"hey everybody this is critical, I'm playing ___ let's do this shit"
Shizuka that aint nothin' like a trickshot :P
wow lol
:_
is ANY of them free?
lol

BOLOGNA! ...............

1,3procaster is free
Shizuka: hold on lemmie link you

Happy Engy is Happy
ohai there
how big is the file for procaster?
I think Ketamina just likes to spout random things
Fleur: you watch cirtical?
i bet none of you know a damn thing about BOLOGNA
1,3let me find it
just dropping in for a bit, has anyone seen a guy called 'Amazon'?
no I dont emantrollslayer.

hey hey I just realized something
if you ever see 'Amazon' again, give him this link http://youtu.be/mHiRC_sNX4w
Fleur: but it's worth it...
1,3about 51MB, give or take
you're a canary

Cya Phase
my gmas not gonna approve of ANYTHING downloadable on her pc
im over here playing mw3, im bored and listening to a sick...instrumental....I win the game
No James, you lose the game.
1,3the file isn't very big, but the actual streaming is pretty resource heavy
dat Black Canary
LIKE A FAUST
oh.. i never lose
i might be able to stream next month or in march
Ace Combat Assault Horizon = real game
/me uses Canary Cry
Maybe she's born with it. Maybe its Maybelline
I lost the game, just like you James >.<
/me throws a boot at JamesIsABrony's head
I warned you
Yeah
Dead Space = Real Game
/me uses... um... er... yawn?
1,3setting up a livestream account is free to do, and you're able to save the streams to see the quality
OMGOMG
oh so you are probably sharing it then?
MirrorImage's Insomnia prevents Sleep Effects
btw what do u mean resource heavy?
Dead Space = Boring Game
Fleur misses by a longshot and i laugh in his/her face
/me uses Hyper Beam
Fleur why yu no throw shoe?
owait, I have a British accent
O_O
I can probably do something with that
SleepyChicken Use attract?
like be sexy
so much lag :(
:3
/me uses attract
Anyone else wanna go to the bunker?
1,3depending on what you're streaming, it can use up a lot of bandwidth, memory, cpu cycles, etc
is it super effective?
lol
as in RAM
I think I might go and play xbox
1,3our regular streamers have some pretty beefy PC's
1,3yeah
GREEEEEN TEXT
xbox is just the best thing.....
da fuq
JamesIsABrony: ooh...you are about to envoke the wrath of the ENTIRE chat
1,3:p
.................. im gettin sleeepy
Well if you do leave Iweywert, cya

Sorta...her room is a wreck...wouldnt touch a toe in there. My room on the other hand is the cleanest room in the house
Well my computer is only a hop, skip, and a jump from my xbox.

:O
OH GOD//2/
Cavy there was only one, but yea
@airmeter giraffes
6 giraffes is 73% air. (28)
Interior Croccodile Alligator
1,3lol
who has a pinkiepie?
(I drive a Chevrolet Movie Theatre)
Who here finds this video scary?
this coversation is irrelephant
I said episode ={
hey there mentally disturbed Twilight :D! Wanna be firends?
also like I said before, I like that the Ponies are apparently up to snuff on some quality mechanical engineering
I see what you did there TopHat
*notices username refers to pinkie's ass*
it's just that that having all that magic means they don't bother with electrical engineering... yet
umm
inb4 that's a plot point for a later season
so close
(Ben Franklin Pony discovers eletricity can be used to do stuff)
Anyway, in Rainbow Dash chat we came to a few conclusions during that episode.
yes stuff
ooh
1,3no spoilers from the new episode, so watch where you go with that BlueDWarrior
Epic Rap Battles of History: Twilight Sparkle vs Michael Myers
Ie: Equestria has a military and war.
im currently feeling very much like Twilight right now... or is it Jack from the Shining... either way, where's my axe...
gotta go! night everypony!
nah I'm just making baseless speculation
Oh, and seeing that Stars live in Caves, Bears must live in the sky.
I can stare at psycho Twilight all day
night!
Canon.
Bye plot of Pinkie
oww....my tooth kind of hurts..
:)
not good
kirzstryfe it's just a hypothetical one, doubt there will be one of that
and dont the ponies have lights? they have electricty dont they?
they have lights but it's like the turn of the 19th Century,
a lot of candles but some magic lights too
19th to 20th Century
1,3the twilight/halloween one?
could be gas they are herbivores after all (inb4 ewwwww)
....
Doesn't that mean they would have to had mined for Petroleum?
2 videos before
Hmmm they also have giant candy canes just saying
The twilight one
no....
someone should write a fanfiction where Applejack and Twilight have to make a Mass Apple Sorter because Granny Smith is too old to sort them simply by herself anymore
The twilight one is the one im asking about
that was the bottleneck during hte competition and I figured that was where the plot was gonna hinge
Should've struck a deal with Flim + Flam, tbqh.
More cider, agree to better percentage, more money.

10,02One more time!
is someone playing a games?
well i'm off to write some code, again. ding me if you need me
so, studying physics 101, newtons third law, just a little question on the side to help students think. "why does a book sitting on a table never accelerate "spontaneously" in response to teh trillions of interatomic forces acting within it?" first thought in my mind? because that would be messed up. I'm a terrible student
lol
wall of text
/me lights himself on fire
dat gal
I'm in physics
It's ok Ingwaz physics is are dumbs
stands next to Midnight_Tempest in order to warm himself
brb food
Well you've got opportunity
nah, its actually quite interesting, just a bit hard to wrap my head around at the moment
In this very community
10,02Because those movements aren't in the same direction at the same time.
/me roasts marshmellows using Midnight_Tempest
because they cancel each other out SuperBrony64
its just hard to fully understand that even inanimate objects exert forces on things when a force acts on them
So it went from horse meat to physics?
damn, out of food
:'(
the idea that when you lean a wall, the wall pushes back on you, otherwise you'd end up on the floor
oh shit derpy
That was my Rarity Midnight_Tempest
just a bit odd, slightly comforting that apparently newton had trouble with the third law as well
physics suck
05everythign is relative
arrow in the eye?
Filly you so silly
suddenly Wrek
/me floats away

Everything is relative, Wrek?

Saucy is an amazing adjective
/me returns to her... um... Skyrim.

SkilledSkillet: do you think I could have asked if she would share some screen-shots?
maybe Mutterguy maybe next time she comes back you should ask
Screen shots?
Oh! Screen shots! right

Lots of burning desires?
/me was seriously confused by Fleur's statment

Dat SB~
Is minecraft any fun anyways? It looks so... blocky.
10,02Hai :>
10,02I thought MineCraft originally was a borefest
10,02But it's sooooo addicting like you wouldn't believe O__O
Hmmz o.O
I thought ponies were a girlyfest
10,02Trust me, I'm not one for sandbox games, but MineCraft certainly convinced me otherwise
To be honest, I found terraria addicting enough
yay reddit is back up
sup guys
Crap. This does look pretty cool. Confound SB, he drives me to minecraft.
10,02IKR
10,02You should get it then we can play together forever and ever ^_^

/me is going to get that lemmonade now
I don't suppose there's a schedule somwhere with all the streams?
what iz streamz?
Not that I'm aaware of
Friday saturday and every other sunday are the only scheduled streams
Random assorted things the rest of the time?
other than that, its bassed on who feels like streaming
yep
Lulu streams House every now and then <3
i like /b/ronies!
If only there was a stream now :(
Most of the streamers are asleep or at work
Or just lazy :3
batman was just on, I'm not crazy
SB is busy playing minecraft
00,10I vote lazy
Yay :(
Sumica just had a long day at work though
It's totally ok
/fluttershy
I don't play Minecraft anymore, I don't find it addicting no longer.
hi
dat double negative
Naturally
:p
anyway, I rarely watch the stream as it is. I come here for the chat
I'm usually posative, but it would lead to a skyrim joke,
In the knee <-----c
All thes arrow to the knee jokes almost make me want to patrol the mojave.
Yeah, one very now and then is kinda fine
but EVERY TWO MINUTES is really annoying :|
/me sings "If you're having adventurer problems I feel bad for you son. I dodged 99 arrows but my knee took one"
hit it
you know you liked that one
Awe, true to caesar
/me just realized that her friend used to be 100% natural untill he took a sledge hammer to the knee
Espeically if they do the joke wrong
:||
that wasnt a joke
he has a titanium knee now
What happened with the sledge?
*cue six million dollar man music*
Did it just fly off it's handle like "WEEEEEE"
because he compleatly shattered his knee with a sledge hammer
ow.
yeah. He passed out from the pain.
Now he's a guard right?
I'm guess he has guard duty, while you go out fighting dragons on Skyrim
He works in the army now so I guess that counts as being a guard?
Also I'm assuming you are actually fleur
Whoops, I raped the English language there. "I guess"
I guess.
ive been up since 2PM im going on 16 hours right now
6_9
I've been up about 20 minutes now
lolol
I
m still asleep
/me has been up for 20 hours now and doesnt give a shit
eeyup
no stream ATM?
/me is used to 90+ hours
No stream, no.
Do you work in a hospital or something?
No
I have insomnia
Seems legit
i used to have insomnia
Fleur u was on here like 3 hours ago then i left cause stream stopped
I can concentrate very well with 4 days of no sleep
is that bot on
i become a large salamander if i don't sleep for 24 hours
00,10I dont have sleeping problems i just am a worshiper of Luna and her creations
I passed 2 finals with no sleep ^_^
Between them?
No. I had no sleep for 4 days and then took 2 finals
i wish i had insomnia i bet you hate it though
Insomnia is the worst thing in the world
i dont like wasting those preciouse weekend hours
I don't have insomnia, just a bitch of a time getting asleep
I never know if I am going to be able to sleep or not
Yeah, usual from staring at a screen for long periods of time ;)
staring at a ceiling for 8 hours is no fun at all
I agree
I've been preoccupying myself reading FoE
I dunno how these screens can be so enternating
/me yawns
ohh god no
its happening!!
?me unyawns
Oh yeah. *Derp*
i mean
I remember now
let me go stare at my rave light again
brb
/me unyawns
Confound you :)'s!
*Opposite of yawn*
/me snway
im up!!
I feel like playing Terraria
Oh look. I still havent gotten that lemonade
lemonade?
Yes, the drink
Could you get me some too fleur?
i know... just Y?
You know, the bubbly drink made from Non-combustable lemons
give him fruit derp
Naeh
oops wrong chatroom
/me uses only the finest combustable lemons to make her lemonade
Its a flavor explosion
In a nutshell
good night everyone
Toodle-Pip
10,02Night bluestrom_S!
night bluestrom_S
im watching something elso on a realy long playlist
thanks for the stream
Don't know where you guys live, it's morning here.
I live where you live
Most likely
10,023:17 AM here
night SuperBrony64
it is 5:16 here and I have church at 10 :\
10,02Night fillyfillyy!
I'm on the moon. atheist and all that.
goodmorning everypony!
10,02Morning Tarku
6:17 here
If I even show the slightest sign of sleepyness I get grounded
10,02I'm going to head off to bed
I'm on Mars, cuz I'm bored
10,02Night all ^_^
morning Tarku
/me 's parents hate that she is agnostic
:o night sb64
sleep well SuperBrony64|Zzz
/me Fleur is awesome for being agnostic
I'm off on Terraria
I dont think someone is awesome just for a religious belief
And yet you still go to church? what?
or lack there of
I'll still be on chat, but will be half afk
im athiest :P
6_9 i love Derpy
bugeyes8 I go to church because my parents hate that I am agnostic
and try to force feed me god
this girl at my school is doing that to me
Always comes back to parents. My best friend has parents that would kill them if they actually knew i made him atheist
Luckily i made my mom atheist, i spread.
I made my Step Brother athiest
Now, I dont have a problem with religions. I just have a problem with people who try to shove shit down peoples throats
so Fleur you are not athiest? your agnostic?
Yet now he smokes...weed ._.
indeed
Not what I had in mind
I say atheist as Non-theist
i was playin on server sb asleep
I got my sister to be an agnostic atheist, and my dad is more along the lines of the same.
i think
atheist is the disbelief in any diety
But I'm not one to actively convert anyone, I think it's dumb tbh
agnostic is "I dont really give a shit"
While i agree with thee 'we can't know' it's irrelevant as an argument
there might be a god and there might not. I am not going to waste my time trying to find out though.
It's a big deal for me because i live in Texas
Kentucky here not so bad
/me lives in arkansas
Helpful chart about atheism/agnosticism: http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lybl970Xy31qj7gpko1_500.png
same fillyfillyy
I'm probably right on the Gnostic line
kool :D
Ooh :D
both KY im in lexington you?
I call myself agnostic because there is no real term for my religious belief
Madisonville fillyfillyy
by belief can be summed up like this
i am and prepare to become one of these
Fleur: "Who-gives-a-shit-ism" ?
hi
I dont fucking care
I just live my life.
/me heyy no showing?
Celestia is best religion.
I personally think the idea of God is really interesting.
im a believe-whatever-the-f***-you-want-to
est
Religion I'm not a big fan of, but God, yeah, really neat concept.
I find the idea of a god to be absolutely disguting
Poundcake we dont always have a stream bro. streamers gotta sleep some time
who here watches TAA??
I'm a proud practicioner of wyld-stallynism.
Depends on what point of view you're looking at it from.
Fleur: so true, but the streams they show always make me laugh :3
We have no gods, but a few words to live by; Be excellent to each other, and party on, dudes.
too bad they are sleeping eh?
Fleur: yeah
oh well

00,10doom64
^^
/me hugs everypony
this game looks pretty well made for its time
it is made with 2d sprites
05cause it is
00,10alot of it came from some great levels
Who s playing
i still think it looks like a primitive version of HalfLife
wrek is
05though if you ask me
05marathon hat alot more to its map design
whoa hes good
what game is this?
doom
Doom
ah
00,10well marathon could do more such as have bridges
05nope
05it oculdnt
looks like a fun game does it come in PSN store?
05HATE ARCHVILES
00,10ikr
nugget bisquit put it in a bisquit!
00,10bfg to the face
lolwut
hey sumica
00,10Sup?
this look like Half Life to u in any way?
00,10nah but I did't play HL till the texture pack came out
05btw quick news: once i beat plutonia and TNT
dayum
05im thinking of gettign quake installed
oo
cool
00,10oh yeah love some quake
Quake = epic
107% kills, logic'd
eeyup
Jim: enemies that probably respawned
05arch viles ressurects
00,10railgun in quake was so much fun.
right
05coutns as a new entity
^_^
I liked the lightning gun
quake 3 rocket jumps
I was imba with it
:)
00,10altho I prefered the railgun in Redfaction
sometimes i forgot this is a website for bronies
u just reminded me fazana
Oolol
Yeah, the last pony face was like 30 mins ago :o
i had a video request but i see that its gametime :D
./)^3^(\.
no problem gametime is cool
00,10heh wrek, you are now entering twilight =p
lol sweet game
You are now in the Twilight Zone
doom was and still is hardcore
this game is something i would still play in 2018
Doom's awsome
Hazard3, this game is a classic of the gaming history.
If you disagree, you deserve to explode twice
yes u do
It made firstpersonshooters popular.
i see how
Then the fish made it stink (CoD)
yep
this game is very well created not only the movment but the animation aswell
00,10realy hard thing about it was there is no strafe and no jumping
also, you can't aim vertically, just horizontall
Quake 1 was kinda the same, but there was jumping
Good thing: No cover based combat
^_^
i wouldnt mind having this rather than a PS3
Just blowing the crap out of enemies with the BFJ10K
BFG10K *
00,10yeah bullts just aim up or down for you so long as you have the left and right covered
well this feels kinda likea puzzle game with enemies to shoot
Now I wanna go on quake 3 :(
^_^
dont leave
I won;t
its not safe...
shes out there!
shes waiting for me!
You mean...her..?
i love deadspace 2
Okay, I'm staying inside then!
Youll see what I see ELLIE! I promise it WONT HURT!
*Listening to the Trololol song*
STROSS PUT DOWN THE SCREWDRIVER!
*Singing along*
haha
just make the face to match it next time XD
La, la la la la la, la la la la laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...
jesus i see why that game is hard
doom is like L4D with better graphics
Graphics Schmafics
awwww yeah
musics!
All the good games look crap
w00t!
i miss Super Mario 64 D:
they didn't spend so much money on graphics and most of it on level design and game mechanics
i still have a nintendo 64!
I still have my supernes
sweet
00,10you got the bfg 9000- Oh yeah!
Lol
yeah
only a 9k
hell yes
Big Fking Gun
I has a BFG10K >:3
*epic face*
You get the 10k in quake 3
DUDE
00,10I was disapointed with the 10k, it was all Rof and no punch
they should make
You sure?
yeah
I blew the living crap out of people with it
a remake of doom
although not needed
I guess it would
a remove would be nice
Doom remake wouldn't sell
00,10Yeah but you had to aim it
because COD FANBOIS
Because then you can arse about more by jumping
will all say it is crap
00,10the 9k it did't matter if you hit or not
Did anyone get srs sam 3?
nope
It's the most recent arcade like game
uh oh
Lets team together to KILL TWILIGHT SPARKLE!
The ONLY one to have adoppted the classic
dayum
fail
Poor Twilight
Is plummeting to your death what real ponys do?! Because Ill only do that if thats what real ponys do!
why there be no ponies :(
i have a suggestion
its HILARIOS
My thoughts on Doom shooting, The axis is round there is no up or down.
yeah
00,10Should let them fight each othere wrek
ah so they ARE fighting eachother.
LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE GOT A VISIT FROM THE DEPRESSION CLOWN!
his pants fall down!
00,10yeah they will fight if they hit friendly fire
and nobody ever laughs!
nice, sumica. I never knew.
NOOOO
05they only fight eachother if its anotehr enemy type
that sucks
cool
more ponies are needed in this game
i fuck all brini
00,10true
broni
fucking idiots
guys
die in the HELL
dont go to the Rainbow Dash room
demon ponies?
u means bronies?
theres a hater there
Troll in #rainbow_dash
STILL no stream?
YES
yes his grammer is worse than his wits :)
xD
i would die in hell but i dont feel like it
all bronies fans are die
all your bases belongs to me?
we are all die?
^
we are not bronies fans we are my little pony fans
Ok, i guess i had to refresh
^_^

^
that are called bronies
Yes?
this game is awesome
u r bithes
somepony needs to film this and put our countgertrolling on youtube
OK?
no we are bronies
*countertrolling
nice job wrek!
your not getting thi smate
almost did it!
Someone decided to have their mommy wake them up bright and early so he could do this so called "Trolling" thing which I might add he's terrible at.
if u go to a brony site with the soul purpose of trolling in mind thats a fucking horrible idea
woohoo!
because trolling one
will alert the others
and u dont want that to happen
00,10Ahh it left before he had enough rope to hang himself with
EVER
Together we can overcome anything :O
haha3
HAZZAAA
CHAINSAW!

Really! Sweet!
00,10.ru host what a shock

^_^
Archvilles are annoying :|
But cacodemons really piss you off the first time you see them
The feel neither pain nor remorse!
AND DESERVE NO MERCY!
..
Bad idea
05funfact: cacodemons 1shot, at 200% armor and hp in melee range
Haha
Derp

LOL Wrek
You don't say?
dayum

^_^

Nice~ Looks like the money was worth it~
He's using a tablet methinks
:D
needs more bacon
needs more ponies
:)
Not my tablet, it's my mom, i hav the most powerful computer so all the editing stuff is on it for the whole family
all I know is I actually like my sketches when I put enough time into them
i will pay u cash to make a plate of f:[ing bacon next to her
and having an eraser removes that issues of 'permanence'
anypony here hate gilda
Paint has an erasur

Could be a tablet for the 5th time :3
