07o3o
night Wrek thanks for the stream!
go fix the stats now
LOL
how do you get over your dads death i really need to know
8,1otakon: well, actually, food that's been out for a while is okay so long as it's cooked after
07I told you that didn't fix it lol
nettrilex: time.
^
and acceptance.
I had food poisoning once, it woke me up at 4 in the morning and lasted all day
You changed it in all the themes?
8,1so if it was cooked, then left out, then that's bad
Thanks for the eps Wrek
And the main theme as well?
8,1but if you nuke the shit out of it, it'll be fine
Because that should have fixed it
I feel like dancing
hi
Dances
time?
CupcakeWarrior ouch...
Can you help me with something :s
Ok, gotta go everypony......college first thing in the morning......SHOW (is) OFF
TIMING!
Isnt it maid hour?
Already there
bye Dark92Enigma take care!
8,1otakon: ah, okay
inb4hacking
no maid hour anymore.
Bai Dark92Enigma
oh god there we go
Goodbye Dark92Enigma
whatisit?
11,01Maid Hour is taking a break.
pony_801122: you random
wait ccan i make a username?
8,1otakon: there are some toxins that won't be gotten rid of by cooking
nettrilex, in most cases, you don't. But it gets easier with time. After a while at least.
Ponies47 the essence of all comedy......TIMING!
Making a shell script, as I'm on Mint12 now
bye
pony_801122: use /nick
ok
8,1but you won't get an infection from properly cooked meat
lol mint 12
/me dislikes mint 12
8,1so it's mostly likely that it was the undercooking, rather than the leaving out
11,01It really depends if people can stop RPing in here.
what sort of shell script? I'm not very good at bash
Is there gonna be another ep?
Alright, this is my first MLP chat place ever
LOLNOPE
okay well at lease it gets better at least thank you
I can do it but I haven't actually really looked into it
07there's a preview in the css editor, when I changed any of the themes it didn't help fix it
ok guys bye im off now
HEY EVERYPONY! Sparkle sparkle sprakle
Kyu, the preview is retarded
8,1otakon: burnt on the outside, or burnt the whole way through?
Bai pony_148
pony_801122: well welcome :) and please make sure to read the rules
ok
11,01So cutting the RP will get Maid Hour back faster :)
Change it first, save, and then test it actually
8,1superretroworld: they were pork, so no
Ponies47: FUCK YEAH SPARKLE SPARKLE SPARKLE
Fuck yeah SPARKLE SPARKLE SPARKLE
Bye bye bye pony_148 guy stay outta my shed ok?
pretty simple, I just need it to do love-unstable ~/desktop/mari0_1.6.love and then kill Cinnamon and restart it
Then what exactly IS maid hour Nittany_Discor?
8,1otakon: what temperature inside?
I'm okay with less rp.
10^
just put those commands onto a new line?
no more stream tonight?
Octavia~<3
Nittany_Discord: oh..i see
Obsidian: no idea, someone might pick it up
Nittany_Discord: i was unaware maid hour was on hiatus, i'll stop now
I don't know *how* to kill a process from terminal
tried to figure it out, but nope
kill pid
ok sooooo
Man, Ristar is fun
or you can use killall process-name
07I'll do it when I have time
8,1otakon: aye. when cooking a whole roast like that, it's generally a good idea to check the internal temperature with a food thermometer
Chrysalis: it's just that people are RPing too much when it happens
oh that works, hi everyone
and you'll need sudo most likely
lol okay
But for some reason, it creeps me out a bit...
Hey Woodenfan
hello Woodenfan
it does need fixing though
Oh hai Woodenfan
07I actually have work I need to do for the next couple weeks lol
Woodenfan: did you check the rules out?
11,01What otakon said.
first time here! hows everyone
why are there so many hackers in Kid Icarus lately?
lol
and yes i did
8,1there's like < 10C difference between breeding and killing temperatures
@otakon yea
otakon: there seems to be alot of people RPing most of the time recently
11,01Mild /me dusts /me cleans is fune.

8,1twilight_sprinkler: Feynmann lectures
Ponies47: I don't know. For some reason I just found it hilarious. I think it's because my friend's cat does it all the time too. :D
Luna: well, you should get some sleep then dear. You don't want to stress yourself out.
oh it's on Fox
07,01I am in control of the night yes, but I am tired... studied with Twilight she's such a bookwurm.
8,1twilight_sprinkler: what sort of level are we talking? pop science or textbooks?
Ponies47: she's in heat unless she's fixed.
Speaking of Twlilight...
Luna: I can see how that'd be exhausting.
*Twilight
So should I come here Friday night to see the movies? or is there some other streaming place for that?
Ponies47: happened with our cat, kept us up for hours on end
http://imgur.com/XXarW :3

Luna: Oh, cool to hear.

Dermathil: you're french, that's why. We get the lousy english dub. How is Wakfu by the way?
Dermathil: There was an original version? This is the only one I've known.
I heard of this before
Gilbert: this is the dub of it
07now I have to find last year's database somewhere in my files OTL

Brass FTW
otakon: this dub is worse than most anime dubs I've heard.
HowToFryChicken: trom(boner) XD
Why?
Om: I tend to get absurdly lucid when I'm tired. :) Besides, the world's fastest precision dummer plays in a progressive metal band.
And as we know, trombones can't rock
Dermathil: agreed
Take me! take me?

/me SONIC BOOM!
Stardust_Phoenix: yeah, sadly.
Well, Nittany, it was a bigger box office hit than avengers
Stardust_Phoenix: yes, and it's glorious
great
so yeah
panda: Yeah, but why cant they stay away from Avatar]
CupcakeWarrior: the third is a lie
I don't care for Avatar's story
1,3need a few more people for l4d2 vs, anyone interested? :)
But yeah, still a long way to go in polishing
Nittany: Avatar is the top box office seller ever. :p
Wut did I just walk into?
ITS AWESOME though
Lol
11,01The only way a bad movie would get a sequel is if it actually made money.
Woodenfan: it was Dances With Wolves
It didn't need a sequel!
CeilingKirz: you guys are still playing :O
Om, why doesnt james cameron just off himself lol
Cameron originally planned for a trilogy of Avatar IIRC
OH GOD
1,3yep
aww yeah
Oh hell naw.
Sumica: oh you :D
I liked Avatar
G1!
OOH
is it the movie?

NO
The reading rainbow
WallDives: Ive heard it will be in 3d
Not sure if gusta actually....
NOT THE SMOOZE
TheHoodyNinja: i liked it too... kind of.... not really XD
The only reason avatar made so much was because of the added prices of the 3D glasses
11,01If you pay to see bad movies, you'll get bad movies.
so how did Troll 2 get a sequel
CupcakeWarrior: it will.
OmegaMetroidBrony: no, G1 with TIREK AND HIS POWERS OF DARKNESS
lol
Not as bad as later gens.
WallDives: I am so going to go watch it
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: bc the name was open
need moar Smooze.
You mean the eclipse is coming and the end is nigh?
>=(
I'll listen to the end of "I'll go it alone" just cuz the animation at the end is so horribly awesome
dat Tony Randall
Om, it sucks because there are so many directors who are much better than him, but they dont get recognition.
11,01If you pay for games that rip you off, you'll get more games that rip you off.
CupcakeWarrior: so am I, bringing coathangers.
James Cameron avatar wasnt bad
meh atleast theres sea ponies
dat twilight
Woodenfan: I'll go it alone, what is that?
WRONG not Twilight
!pokemon
Kosoveon, you are a 14Ekans.
and THAT is Twilight
the song in the movie
yeah, it may be 4 in the morning but i am not risking anyone coming in and seeing this on my screen
...
Nittany: Meh. Except Avatar's hardly a terrible movie. That movie gets such a bad rap for no reason. It wasn't even the worst movie of that MONTH much less the year or "ever". >_>
so... twilight wishes....
and THAT is Rainbow Dash
panda: And that is one reason this world is a bit messed up

More recently, my earworms have consisted of that G3.5 song about everyone flying away on a balloon. Man, that would make an awesome series finale for G3.5
Wait. This travesty is playing- and SB64 ISN'T HERE? Is that even LEGAL?

mfw this game has an actual storyline
Macross 7
00,10had it checked out last week they gave me one for the other leg cause my legs being unbalenced was preventing it from seting properly
The only thing that would make this game better is if they had Omnimon in it.
lol
13sumica's legs look like hooves

Sumica: WUT happened?
Sounds bad.
Even though I didn't like that particular series that much, the music was pretty good

MrPoniator: I love MegamanX lol
11,01Clerks it is.
11,01Thank you.
Mega Man X was my first game ever
so awesome
My first game was Pokemon Yellow
*nods silently*
Mine was Doom.
Actually, it might have been Super Mario World
My first game ever was a tank game on atari
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
good times
11,01My first game was Super Mario Bros / Duck Hunt.
Satan is my motor!
I poured milk all over my Super Nintendo when my dad was playing Super Mario World. :$
I wasn't warned SRW was being streamed again!!!
dat bounce
11,012 games in 1. Imagine that.
00,10yeah CupcakeWarrior but what kind of injury is gonn give me wings?
hear my motor caaaaar
Nittany_Discord true dat
Sumica: Red Bull overdose?
DaringDude: lolwut
Nittany_Discord, I can't even get 1 games in 1 these days
Sumica: Obviously getting hit with a Red Bull Can.
song Xd
00,10seems legit, and i do ahve like 3 cases of it from work
I drank 15 red bulls the other weekend
OH
11,01Yeah.
I saw you there Lyra
Stage 58?
00,10bartenders always gave me a can
11,01Unless you buy the DLC.
It's like soda for me, really
dayum
i would like to see the Mecha from Xenosaga in this game... that would be awesome
Nittany_Discord: http://derpy.me/dMzzk
MrPoniator: thats not healthy
My first handheld was... a bootleg from China. .-.
so much red bull
My first game was maniac mansion on C64
00,10I never drak them unless I am dea tired
So I finally read Rainbow Factory.
I know, but I wanted to stay awake
Fuck i feel like a retard
/me has never had Red Bull
11,01This is why you avoid EA, THQ, or Capcom titles with their damn on-disc DLC.
And they had free red bull at the venue I was in
PartyCannon: it's tangy
So why not?
00,10halfway through R2 otakon
otakon: around episode 13 season 2?
I love how China is pretty rich but they continue to make bootlegs. :I
Dermathil: I meant in game here
DaringDude No, it was really stupid.
otakon: Halfway through?
MrPoniator: lol seize the opportunity
CrimsonPhoenix I think so.
2,14 he has it in the beginning
Link
in PM
I haven't had Red Bull yet. They say that it tasts just like beer...
2,14 and at one point he breaks into his separate unit
Spell-of-Gaming. IIRC, they've bootlegged entire companies
It doesn't
2,14 if you don't take his command unit out, he assumes control of the battleship
Ninjazz Kind of. That's a few minutes of my life I'll never get bacik.
Ninjazz: I tasted it once, hated it
11,01Rainbow Factory is meh.
spit it back out
dat penetration
11,01RBD Present's interpretation is many times better.
btw Caramel. I started a new game of SRW J. I'm getting Tekkaman Blade right now.
Hmmm.
I enoyed Rainbow Factory
I can't exactly describe how it tastes like, but it's closer to a soda than beer
^
better than Cupcakes
Tekkaman Blade is a cool fellow
BIG O!
Nittany_Discord: my thought exactlty :D
why?
BIG O
Nittany_Discord Yeah, you can't even say it was well-written, like Cupcakes.
AND ACTION!
00,10SHOWTIME
Fucking screw Cupcakes. :|
I dunno
11,01RF is better written.
1,3sleepy time, have a good night everypony :)
^
Ninjazz: imagine salt mixed with pickle juice with a sweaty sock dipped in
11,01Night kirz
Cupcakes, Cheerilee's Garden, and the like
Ninjazz: pinkie is still best pony
night kirzstryfe sleep well
MahBoi777: Ohh god...
G'night Capt Kirz
I love how I dont recognize anyone in this game except Renton and Simon
Night kirzstryfe!
The fact that im talking about this and should have know youd shoot me down hard
Take care.
Cupcakes is beyond overrated
gnight kirzstryfe
*crashes like a lil plane*
CupcakeWarrior: YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN BIG O!?
:P
it's just gore, oh my
CupcakeWarrior: FOR SHAME!
DaringDude: I love her to death too, but Rarity.
The biggest problem I've with them is that the characters go to bit extremes or otherwise turn out to be such nutjobs
11,01Cheerilee's Garden?
NO
but the writing was horrible
and the puns oh god why
otakon: I saw the first episode myself. Never got to watch the other episodes.
00,10all dem lockons
Grimdark Pony Fanfics > Screamers
CupcakeWarrior, not even Viral?
otakon I've never seen Big O either.
GabeMoist: Hes in this game?
Oh wait, it's the other around
DaringDude: /)
11,01Never heard of Cheerilee's Garden.
Dermathil: argh, you of all people would probably like it
I like Prince Charming the best from that type of fics, but the second part was pretty stupid, and maybe the end of the first in a few ways
IKR
shoot you down hard?
One of the few good Grimdarks I like is Solar Flare.
CupcakeWarrior, he was with Simon
!pokemon
Kosoveon, you are a 10Drowzee.
LOL NO
(\
00,10spacial bullets, that's just evil
Cheerilee's Garden is SAW meets ponies, really
Except, no escape for the victims
its your DESTINY!
oh my
SEND 00RAISER
11,01Best Grimdark I've read so far is Silent Ponyville.
SHENLOGN!
MrPoniator: Thanks for the warning... Not going to touch that... -_-
You guys want something
00,10claw rape
creepy?
Nittany_Discord: It's one of the better ones, indeed.
Sumica: it's nothing on Granzon

I heard Gundam Seed is terribad
good night everyone
DIDNEY WURLD
CrimsonPhoenix: I remember that
00,10macross quarter!
night Bluestrom_S sleep well
For the most part it's just a gore fest that gets a bit too boring after a while, despite some of the situations being rather intriguing
MACROSS ATTACK
Gnight Bluestrom_S. Take care.
lol lyra
It feels weird being an ME3 fan right now.
gnight Bluestrom_S
Shiny
That thing is huge...
BTW guys, this is a PSP game
But the ending of the second part of Cheerilee's Garden was pretty well set-up, which for me justifies the time it took to read it
Awesome music too.
Lol
00,10it is a command ship
SHINY
Then CupcakeWarrior can you vouche me on how creepy it is?
CrimsonPhoenix: Not very imo
well dang
I kinda wanted to flirt with you, but im an idiot for thinking youd want to
MrPoniator: What could possibly justify pointless slash and gore?
Well, that Macross isn't as big as the colony ones :p
Goodnight everyone
GETTER ROBO
/me sings along Heats
CrimsonPhoenix: But the polemon creepypastas are my favorite creepypastas
gnught Cobellanez
Night Cobellanez. Take care.
00,10getter axe
pokemon*
Ninjazz, I like Shakespeare tragedies
>.>
Ahhh. I see.
And Cheerilee's garden used that pretty well in its ending
oh umm
yeah I wasnt expecting that
I guess I could give it a chance...
HEATS is among the best songs there is
Better than Cupcakes?
And since that part didn't even involve gore or so
hmmmmm
Lol yeah
MAP ATTACK
Thats why im an idiot :C
better than cupcakes, just prepare for more gore
00,10NBE missles
/me sighs
:/
Id much rather read clopfics than gore
I read neither
Ninjazz: challenge accepted? lol
Alright... I suppose I should atleast try that one out before I decide to burn it.
But yeah, it's really the ending that's the only neat part of it, so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone
Sorry
Unless you've hots for gore or something
Ill run away now
/me 11,01goes to read Cheerilee's Garden.
:/
Okay. Never mind. :$
v[Rock Band DLC] Bee Gees - "You Should Be Dancing"

you talkin about Samurai Cop?
lol
I'm going to be going to bed soon anyways
Alrighty
cyas
You guys heard of suicidemouse.avi?
Bye
Yep
NO KALLEN
I think so...
11,01It has to be as bad or worse than Sweet Apple Masssacre to even start to bother me, and SAM was just blatant sex/gore/stupid.
00,10those red guys have cool attacks
oh crap that is GONNA HEART
03hm
03yeah so that dude died?
2,14 yeah
03I could do a tribute on my show
yes
ouch
03but I dunno if I'm doing a show
2,14 they're experimental dimensional beasts
03since >no school Friday
03and I want to go home
03if I do, though
oh. Samurai cop got insta WMC'd, so I thought- yeah.
Dimensional Beasts are assholes,.
2,14 designed to take revenge on Zexis for fucking up their boss
00,10pinkie monsters, got it
03I could play that song or efven Staying Alive
03-f
03the irony :P
I like how those basic enemies rip a hole to the space time continuum, and yet, only do like 1k damage
oh lovely Dimensional Beasts
11,01Samurai Cop is porn.
THEY SHATTER THE FOURTH WALL!
ohohoho
Lol how weak
SUZAKU GO
I hate how famous stupid fan fics get to the point where people actually redo them.
Nittany_Discord: you're kidding right?
11,01Porn is instant WMC.
11,01We screened it.
11,01It's pretty much a porn flick.
00,10yeah it's realy pointless porn too
But that's the best kind! D:
......well then......
Sumica: Most porns are pointless
I figured it was gonna be a C
00,10Dont get me wrong she had a nice rack but yeah. Full frontal
Ninjazz, Not when there are 13 year olds attending the BMNs.
11,01I know we've seen worse, but rated X is not allowed.
Sumica lol
13we DO have standards
00,10eh it's no X raited
like skinemax quality?
Dermathil: I was just joking... and I forgot about that...
Shizuka: we know that!
It's R, but very strong sexual content
wow, so what's the B movie again?
Lol Shizuka
00,10just lots of clothing on rubbing
yeah. NEVER FORGET the 13 year olds.
11,01I think Reqiuem/Evil Dead will be the most "adult" movie set we'll ever show.
00,10but still not fitting
2,14 the only sexual content we allow is the boob physics from this game >: (
Caramel: indeed!
lol
Why are you showing my videos, then?
I doubt that... >_>
So the movie will be replaced with..what?
shield ur eyez children
MrPoniator: that doesn't count!
It's even worse than The Room?
00,10you should change your colors if you are gonna be Caramel =p
00,10dat polandamy
Man, I was looking forward to Samurai Cop too, sounded campy.
GOOOOOOOOOO
13we'll try to get a hold of the idio--I MEAN wonderful viewer that voted for it and get a repick
13otherwise we'll see
Too bad it's just a skinflick
Aye, otakon.
7,8 Luna doesn't like me using her colors :P
OUCH MY EYES!
:D
11,01Rob Zombie's Halloween with the most "pornographic" thing we'll ever show (though I doubt we'll see it again).
Shizuka: That was chosen for this weekend?
/me cringes
And who was the winner Shizuka ?
Caramel: BLUE ON YELLOW DAMMIT!
Caramel, you need MORE TRANS AM
Nittany_Discord: that crappy movie should have been WMC'd
What movies are planned for next friday, if any?
THE HELL!?
Didn't we show a girl get raped by a tree in Evil Dead?
GETTER BEAMU
13A movie this week is Footloose
he's riding a GIANT DRAGON!?
I mean Fluttershy.
00,10it might have been an ok movie if it did't have the pointless sex bits
Not WMC, but Halloween was by no means an A movie.
otakon: that's a getter ship.
I still find Footloose to NOT be an A movie, hardly even close to a B :p
mfw Ive never seen Footloose yet
Ninjazz: yeah, but hey just show it poking her in thr crotch.
Ohai bronystate. Ohai giant robots. :)
Tovler: Halloween 07 was crap
hiya Petrified_Discord
otakon: Still... Rape, man.
00,10cause caht would have had fun with samerai cop
Ninjazz: aye
how about we just skip past the sex bits?
00,10chat*
Really wish there were more epic-tier mecha games
Sumica I thought about some... things that would be said
11,01Did Samurai Cop have a plot, or was it just a porno?
MrPoniator: We got some dance movie called Footloose coming.
I like Zone of the Enders, but there's not enough content or gameplay
MrPoniator: There's something called Force now that's pretty wicked MEcha game
Dat Lyra jumping out of the explosion
13from what i read, the "plot" is just an excuse to get from pointless sex scene to pointless sex scene
00,10not sure I would have to watch in real time to know of any thing besides chipmunk voices
I was hoping it was Footloose 2011. I kinda want to see that.
What was that one FPS with a mech thing going on
By some pretty small team too
I gotta know. Is this the last stage or what?
Another Century's Episode?
Shizuka so basically, like a porno
13eeeyup
we should watch Arthur
MrPoniator: I think I know what you're talking about... Mecah Assault I think.
00,10softcore at best
I see robots!
Mecha*
I don't think it was that
MrPoniator: Section 8?
Hey Polydunami!
Also, hey there everypony! n_n
Hi Polydunami, its Shizuka's birthday today
Sumica: it's Skinemax material
11,01But I don't feel like watching pointless sex (or sex at all).
hiya Polydunami
hey Polydunami!
Nah, not that one either
watermelon is best melon
Nittany_Discord: Don't forget to think about the 13 year olds!
Hey Shizuka!
MrPoniator: When was it made?
Happy birthday!
00,10there was never penetration so realy it would not rate skinamax
I'm partial to Honeydew myself
MrPoniator: there are no other recent FPS that have you playing in a giant mech suit
I believe it's still in the works
GODMARS
Wait so if a man had the tip of his ummm thing cut off and he had sex.. would it be pointless sex?
00,10perhaps late night comidy central or scifi
Dammit DaringDude
They posted gameplay footage last year at least
Sumica: there is none of that in a skinemax. although lots of dry humping I'm afraid
13<3
XD
Wait, whose birthday is it?
13all the wub
11,01We had 13-year-olds watch Requiem.
Lol DaringDude
11,01I hope they learned from it.
lol dry humping
11,01We did warn them, though.
MrPoniator: Steel Battalion? That is gonna suck
So we have some Caramel robots again? I'm okay with that :3
/me hugs Shizuka
HEY Petrified_Discord! it's shizuka's
13rain rain~<3
BIRTH DAY!
00,10back in a bit.
Well then happy birthday Shizuka :)
HAPPY BIRTHDAY Shizuka! :)
Egh. Gundam SEED sux.
Happy Cake day Shizuka :)
Steel Battalion was for Xbox?
Steel Battalion was on the original Xbox
Or is it SEED Destiny that is in here...?
MrPoniator: eeyup, and it's coming back as a KINECT ONLY title
Huh
:|
I've missed that memo
Shizuka: http://derpy.me/0oIZU
HOLOGRAPHIC INTERFACE
also, YES
otakon: It makes the game way cheaper, at least
MrPoniator: the first Steel Battalion was GREAT! It had a HUGE FRIGGIN CONTROLLER.
13awww <3
yeah, I know
otakon: But of course the controls will suck, being on Kinect
CupcakeWarrior: you still need to buy a 180$ KINECT to play it, so no.
03http://i.imgur.com/MPNaw.jpg <- So this comes as a result of my boredom :P
/me runs
I've been intrigued to get the game just because of the controller
Rainbow Dash is... pretty cool, I guess
/me 13is tearing up, so used to being ignored on her birthday
13<3
CupcakeWarrior: the original release of Steel Battalion was cheaper
HAPPY BIRTHDAY SHIZUKA
03yeah I know there was only one female character, so sue me
lol
SIMON
/me hugs Shizuka "You could NEVER be ignored here dear!"
Wait, it's the 22nd for you. Is that your birthday?
NEVA
Doesnt Steel Battalion erase your saxe when you die?
save*
Yep
11,01I know what I could get Shizuka.
CupcakeWarrior: eeyup, so you have to remember to eject.
Sumica: u still there or u asleep
CupcakeWarrior: and there is even a self destruct switch
Oh yeah
He'll be back in a bit, Shane.
CupcakeWarrior: it goddamn rocked
The game I was thinking about was Hawken
/me hugs Shizuka
/me glomps Shizuka
I wish I had an original Xbox
13oo hawken looks awesome
13like tribes but with mechs
we should watch Nothing To Lose :)
MrPoniator: Hawken is PC, and not even out until next year, the beta is coming in six months though.
Shizuka: My nametag is already registered for Hawken.
Though, I wish Hawken used the mech aspect more creatively
yup
Shizuka: same here
otakon: 12/12/12 MY BOY
THIS YEAR
thx to Sumica i got the Code Lyoko song stuck in my head again :$
I actually had an original Xbox.
13HERE WE ARE
13GOING FAR
13TO SAVE AAAALL THAT WE LOVE
Dermathil: lol yeah right, I BET you it gets pushed back.
13you're welcome :3
At the moment you could just replace the HUD with a typical FPS and gun, it wouldn't look much different
lol Shizuka
Nothing To Lose: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119807/
Other than looking more like Tribes
Apparently people found out that the mayan calendar doesnt end this year
sosumi
otakon: pretty sure it won't. The closed beta starts then
Caramel: do u double screen?
TIERIA GO
SERAVEE GUNDAM!!!!
ok brb then
2,14 double screen...?
oh hell
why are the character assignments so random?
thats what you were doing
lol
03YEs
03and well
um, that Gundam has a FACE ON ITS BACK
But yeah, something like Zone of the Enders, but with more content and all would be nice
03only a few make sense
03I'm the hulk because... yeah that should be obvious
otakon: TWO-IN-ONE DEAL
lol
13two monitors i think he means
Ah, there is my lottery link :)
green text
On December 21st, we blare air raid sirens as a mockery of the 2012 fiasco >:3
the mech can separate into TWO
03and Aurora got to be the female character because >female
03...LOL
03not even that
( ¬‿¬)
Polydunami: lol
03the fact that I'm like, big? :P
Caramel: u have 2 monitors lol
he ends up holding SIX SWORDS
03the other 3 were just randomy
dat beam shield, NICE!
03-y
nah see, I could be somewhat like black widow
thats right otakon... thats actually 2 gundams together
03what's his name
Midnight_Tempest: neat
03the lame guy
Polydunami: Best Troll Evar
03who has no pwoers
03:D
having two monitors is awesome
/me feels this chat should have significantly more cake
dat Amuro Ray
03no but that's because he's the um
hawkeye
03least manly of the 3
2,14 no, I stream from a laptop
03XD
I like some Gundam VS arcade game I played the other day, and it was pretty cool
/me magically creates Shizuka a birthday cookie
he has powers :<
In the end, people just want giant fighting robots so I'm not sure how you'd get a good robot game going.
what powers do i have?
needs moar cake!
oh crap, no that's TETSUJIN 28!
captain AMERKA
03and wait what
Too late, I already turned in my survey, which will lose.
aka GIGANTOR!
otakon: yup, and the other one can operate seperately... like a mobile doll
03since when does Hawkeye have powers
Caramel: so how r u playing at typing at the same time?
Only if it was expanded little more than just small deathmatches in closed areas
03he just shoots arrows
Midnight_Tempest: nice
and* not at
hawkeye has ridiculous eyesight/accuracy :>
03I questioned why he even got to be part of the team until I saw the movie XD
Aye.
2,14 it's not running fullscreen
03OK fine
GO TETSUJIN!
it's nothng special
Wow, Gundam?

Caramel: ;p; k
but it is a power
03supposedly both he and Black Widow do have powers in the comicx
03s
This is NOT a gundam
/me gives chat cake
Oh.
Octavias_Pride: HELL YEA
03lik eshe's supposed to be really old or something
Tetsujin 28
03and not aging as much
Octavias_Pride: I'll have you know that I AM!
Polydunami: no, the ORIGINAL giant robot, the granddaddy of them all, TETSUJIN 28
imma kinda physced that code lyoko is running for a 5th season
I see
But there ARE gundams around
damn, just SHORT of killing them
lol, 10
and HA Iron Will for the win!
DAI-GUARD!!!!
03also that picture is about as artistic as I get :P
KNOT-PUNISHER ATTACK
I'm not even
Is that even supposed to hurt?
I became a Toonami hater before it got cancelled. I don't wanna seem like a hypocrite.
not even sure how to handle this picture lmao
13see now that everyone's seen some of lyoko, they'll recognize what my picture was inspired by http://i.imgur.com/it7Wi.jpg
MrPoniator: some pilots have skills that when used reduce all incoming damage to 10
03XD
03I was just having fun
Yeah, but still
cuz admittedly, it's true OTL
03yeah
Shizuka: *gasps*
03well
I still think it's hilarious how they did Toonami as an April Fools thing and were surprised wheneveryone was like "YES! That's what we wanted!"
03It was like
MrPoniator: it does hurt however
2,14 which I use against people I know are going to violate my anus
03ordinarily we don't all side together like that
03so I thought that was worth noting XD
I live a frustrating life
13someone drew that for me in high school
More like tickle?
03you get to interrogate people all day?
... Whoa ...
I don't care of other's opinions, but once someone doesn't tolerate someone else, I don't tolerate said intolerant person
Caramel: well, after seeing what these guys can do I'm not surprised, they look like anus destroyers for sure.
I basically am the definition of hypocritical
Orange!
Petrified_Discord: Ikr? they need to open their eyes lol
i use to watch code lyoko like 5, 6 years ago
HOLY CRAP
the hell kind of mech is that?
THAT IS WEED
ORANGE KUN IN THE SUTHERLAND KRIEG
I didn't know Code Lyoko was so popular.. My friends hated it. :$
WHY ARE YOU SMOKING IT AGAIN
03Everybody's a hypocrite in its own regard
03wait what
2,14 and they're the trash mobs of this level
/me shuts window
I liked it though.
03er
Memorize THIS!
03in their own regard, I mean
2,14 I haven't even triggered the round 2 reinforcements
Caramel: oh god,the boss THE BOSS
brb coca runner shootign time
Caramel: wait..........THIS IS ROUND ONE?!
Oh so I got here THAT early have I Caramel?
yes otakon.
haven't seen code lyoko since cartoon network ran it.....and it's still going on?
Why hello there, little guy!
SOMEONE directly near my apartment
smokes weed
2,14 yes Dermathil, and you should consider yourself lucky I didn't decide to just finish it on my own after yesterday
he's so cute...............
03oh
03that sucks
all the time
03we had this kid who did in my dorm
lol
and then he wrecks their shit
awwwwwww
and it wafts into my room
GRRR
03and he made the halls smell like it
you better not do that
13Octavias_Pride: season 4 was the end but there's a rumored fifth season coming now
I WANT TO WATCH
He's damn fast too! :O
13some four years after
it's either the people next to me, under me, or kitty corner
2,14 then don't bitch about the things I stream
it's too strong to be any further
And doesn't even change his facial expression
Seriously, it's a VOTOM that is basically the lowest tech mech there besides Boss Borot
Shizuka: code lyoko season 5 is coming out in oct
I had merely expressed my distaste for the show before leaving.
ah.....if I remember right, season four ended with Xana's manifestation, yes?
So... who is this Kiriko or whoever that is?
it's basically a exoskeleton with big guns
Shizuka: its not rumored its actually happening
no complaints plz
in other news
MAZINGER Z!
2,14 yeah, and it's incredibly rude
it is 10:30 I NEED TO FINISH MY ROOM
03XD
/me complains about complaints
03but yeah I actually made my humanities teacher laugh today
Shizuka: but their live actioning the the parts that arent in the virtual world?
Xana got manifested?! :O
03she was like, what's this author trying to convey
Caramel: whats rude?
btw
Next, you'll be telling me that Boondocks Season 4 is happening.
03some kid goes "He's saying not to be a hypocrite"
who's nick fury
............
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: complaining about what's on the stream
he doens't have anyone's name
They hit the skybox's limits
03and then she goes on about how the author IS a hypocrite
:<
Ow
13http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Code_Lyoko_Evolution_logo.jpg is it me or are they borrowing heavily from tron legacy >>
Tovler: if only man, if only
03and I'm like "Everybody'sa hypocrite in their own regard"
OctaviaIsBestPony: probs i havent seen it since 2008
03she LOL'd like "True"
Caramel: i have to say this
03and well
Petrified_Discord: Lol u shud have been here yesterday
03for one, Nick Fury isn't an actual Avenger
yeah but I'm a rather obnoxious case of it lol
dis music
03and two, we don't have any black people
/me runs
that you know of :<
03well yeah
TO THE PEOPLE WHO DONT LIKE WATS BEING STREAMING SHUT THE BUCK UP!
Eh, need mor Baram Doban
oh nd this guy owns
Indeed, Shizuka.
03nah but mainly because he's not one of the 6
or Time to Come
THE STREAMERS WILL STREAMER WHAT EVER THEY LIKE
13unknown if an english version will be produced, bummer
03the only put him in the poster, because he's (as I quote), Samuel L. Motherf***ing Jackson
or hell, Blade that Cleaves Evil
Alicorn_Prince_Shane, do you need to stick up for the streamers?
or TROMBE!
calm down Alicorn_Prince_Shane lol
bewm
I don't like that it's live action now
he's still got a rather big part thogh
though
Polydunami: well im sick of the shit streamers get
Alicorn_Prince_Shane : exactly
03true
13unless they have new characters it just won't be right without sharon mann heading aelita and jeremie
03well
he doesn't do any fighting normally. but he's still technically an avenger I believe
streamers srs get so much shit from people
mainly, the head of it
03I don't think anyone else was involved in that discussion on either night
almost 2 weeks until everyone laughs at the Wii U again.
03or else I'd add thenm
03*them
its ridicoulous
I'm not one to complain about the streamers myself
That's funny coming from you, Shane. :$
Dermathil: why did you freak over CL anyway? and calmly please.
me neither
loljk http://derpy.me/DDOvK
Ninjazz: stfu lol
If I don't get enjoyment from the stream, I'll enjoy the chat itself
Tovler not sure if that's a compliment or not
hehehe :$
Ninjazz: i ask if they show something yea but i dont complain about the stream
random chat is best chat
Better not. You'll know what will happen. :|
MahBoi777: ^
SuperBrony64|AFK: is best Cow
lol
/me tries to remember if the e3 press conferences were streamed here or not.
Ohai dragon robot? :O
wow, he looks pissed
lion...
whoa
That would be pretty awesome...
Petrified_Discord: I think lion
Ganleon... lion...
Shizuka, by 'borrowing heavily' you meen 'completly ripping off tron legacy's art style'
and ded
brb
Because lions are known for their wings and firebreath. :
*:D
Will BronyState be showing E3? It'd be awesome to see chat's reactions to what Gaben anounces. :D
LOL
though i'd still like to see it
Go Tieria! Kick his ass!
Gaben is a baws
Ninjazz: it won't happen
Ninjazz, lol, bronystate at e3
Damn...
HYPER BURST MODE!
that would be epic
HI Everypony
lol Phase4 :D
Hello Kriel_Pony :3
hi Kriel_Pony!
Just give me my E3 demo of AC3 and I'll be content :)
Kriel_Pony... Watch out for Ghosties.
hiya Kriel_Pony welcome tot he Super Robot Taisen Power Hour
Kriel_Pony: :D you're back
ohai Kriel_Pony
Lol Petrified_Discord
that akward moment when you bite into a piece of watermelon only to get nothing but rind.....
damn, STILL not enough
13http://screensnapr.com/v/LNHGit.png not bad
Ninjazz: hmmm?
Kriel_Pony: Turns out your advice nearly broke his laptop. :(
Woohoo Dai-Guardo!
EPIC ADVICE
Advice?
Ninjazz: No way. Combatibility mode literally can't do that.
Kriel_Pony: what did you tell Ghosties?
/me still can't figure out why every AC:MLP crossover has Octavia as an assassin. Is there something I'm missing? 6_9
Kriel_Pony: Not sure what happened but man was he PISSED.
/me finished voting in the lottery
Petrified_Discord: no idea, I guess she just looks better in it is all
Shizuka, so they are ripping of both trons?
:P
the Assassin robes I mean
Ninjazz: I suggested trying to run steam in combatibility mode for his KoTOR mod
Oh yeah, the lottery
Petrified_Discord: your right, it should beFluttershy lol
All I'll say about the lotto is that I hope my B movie wins
... I'll be right back
Hidden chello bow perhaps?
13it was always pretty heavily related to tron
I mean, to undo it, you need to click one sincle check box
Knot punisher arm!
Kriel_Pony: I know. He did that. He said his laptop went into fits and had trouble starting back up.
eeyup
The new Lyoko is live action?
"Lemme just ARM myself"
I sold out and only picked movies that would make me beloved.
how do u categorise A movies from B movies?
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Columns
13at least in concept, cause the environments were more natural than tron
fair enough, it just looks a smidge too much like the end of the original tron imho
Ninjazz: Well that is more likely related to the mod that was already shutting down his PC than anything
13and colorful
Alicorn_Prince_Shane, check the faq
Alicorn_Prince_Shane, http://www.bronystate.net/faq/

GOddammit I like that pan flute in the beginning of this them
03"Disney" "The Other Disney"
Alicorn_Prince_Shane, ^ Polydunami
theme*
Ninjazz: Hell, I ran compatibility mode on steam on my PC first to make sure it wouldnt cause a problem
Kriel_Pony: Indeed. But I advice to watch out for Ghosties when he comes back. He should be calmed down now, so there's that.
FIRE ALL OF THE MISSILES
Just saying.
what category would District 9 fall under?
13the idea of a second supercalculator with a replika core is a very interesting idea since season 4 established that one replika is equivalent to a quarter of lyoko's capacity
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: we've shown it already, A
Ninjazz: Well, thanks for the heads up. I really was jsut trying to help...
Shizuka: u sure do know ur lyoko /)
dodgey dodgey
13looks like they're keeping the major character designs and environments, so that's good
Kriel_Pony: I know, I told him that. I'm sure he understands now. He was just freaking out is all. :)
03also mfw
03Hollywood wants to distance itself from its own anti-piracy efforts, by no longer referring to downloaders as thieves
and then he took a shot to the crotch
Well,
Well, it looks like our B movie this week was cancelled...?
Shizuka: but in code lyoko their making the non lyoko scenes Live Action
oh, Pandora's Pinata drops today.
Or replaced?
Polydunami: gonna get another one
I'm done for the night
Polydunami: gonna get replaced
Shizuka I think I'll watch an ep, and we'll see~
13best of luck to them for casting a live action aelita cause very few people can pull off pink hair well
Polydunami: y?
night CupcakeWarrior sleep well
Ninjazz: NOW I feel all guilty though...
13PartyCannon: find one from season 3 or 4
um... jiggle?
dat boob jiggle
wuh
what are they gonna call em now
Alicorn_Prince_Shane, the B movie was removed
I've seen the whole series :)
panda: SRT's are INFAMOUS for jiggle
otakon: you got ninja'd :D
Shizuka: i dont remeber but did aelita come into the real world i think she did?
13well tehre you go~
Polydunami: y tho
panda: bye milliseconds
otakon: hehe :D
Don't worry about it, Kriel_Pony.
Inappropriate content
I mean when the new season is out
crap, BATTLESHIP!
03no idea
03http://www.digital-digest.com/news-63368-MPAA-Boss-Dont-Call-Piracy-Theft.html.
03er
03http://www.digital-digest.com/news-63368-MPAA-Boss-Dont-Call-Piracy-Theft.html
13yeah aelita got out at the end of season 1 but xana attached the plot thread to her to keep season 2 running, was pretty weak
We'll have an update, I guess
13by season 3 she was solid out of lyoko and it was established she is originally from reality
Right, I have to write my ballot. Be right back
Shizuka: how are you guys gonna go about picking the new B?
Shizuka yeah Franz Hopper was far more interesting
/me zips lips
13otakon: trying to find the guy that voted it to get a re-pick, otherwise we'll see
Shizuka: I just say re-pick from the lottery of last week, you have the records of it somewhere right?
Shizuka: u sure do kno ur lyoko
13dunno, i don't run the lottery >>
Footloose is kind of a cult hit B movie. Replace it with Wall-E
13Alicorn_Prince_Shane: like i said, i was a major aelita fangirl before asuka
Tovler: I second this idea
Nu Gundam!!!!
dem PsyCommu Funnels...
good shot
13plus i remember stuff about shows a lot... for instance you give me one or two frames from any season 1-3 episode of spongebob i could probably name the ep and start quoting the scene
lol Shizuka
you ARE a silly filly
Shizuka I know that feel
I'm the same way with many games sadly
13though now it's usually the opposite.. someone starts quoting spongebob, i dive the archive and pull a screenshot of the scene
Oh my, here comes the mech that's powered by orgasms.
Dermathil: huh?
Shizuka, I'm a similar way with M*A*S*H
and then
Aquarion works on orgasms.
TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOONAH!
I wish I was joking.
Dermathil: you're ..........not joking.
-_-
Right, is City of God too violent for bronystate?
I mean, we saw Evil Dead on here
And Requiem for a Dream...
*suddenly, burning smell*

YEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
Luna is having guests
Seriously, you think colliding with THE MOON would do more damage than that...
Right. City of God is in the imdb 250 so I guess it would count asa an A movie, however violent it may be. It's Brazilian

Caramel: have you put 00raiser on the field?
I wonder if anypony ever saw 12 Angry Men at one point or another?
so has anyone tried to put more than 96 desktop on your screen?
2,14 yes
ah.
And I'm not talking about real life or the internet, either
Caramel: what happened?
Last I checked, when fully upgraded, his final attack does 50K damage.
2,14 was responding to dermathil
oh
2,14 Dermathil: if you're hacking yes
Caramel: I mean all stats maxed out
but you don't hack, do you Caramel?
of course he doesnt otakon
2,14 which you can only get either by hacking, or replaying the game at least 20 times
True
But I saw it in an attack-showcase video.

Alright. Not looking forward to school very much though, panda.
2,14 I used all of his spirit commands
dammit.... another 4th wall breaker?
Ninjazz: they have the WHOLE first series for 10 buck at walmart
OH SHIT
BronyJenkins: how come?
2,14 which increased his damage by x3.5
Caramel: does he have Love?
im gonna call it a night fillies and colts.....peace
O_O
The Power of Love :3
Hot Blooded?
gnight Octavias_Pride!!
A business exam. >_<
Wait... I don't have a Walmart here. As surprising as that sounds.
Use the SPIGOTs!!!
otakon, and that depends if you accidentally pick up Robotech instead of Macross :p
Caramel: i.e. the one that combines stuff like valor, strike, sense an the like into one spirit command?
no walmart?
Ninjazz that IS surprising :o
We have a Walmart here :$
2,14 nah, he doesn't

2,14 Simon does though
Irk. :$
MrPoniator: oh good point........it's Robotech IIRC
Spigot attack!!!!!
MrPoniator: well,t he one done by Harmony Gold from the 80's
/me still has flashbacks to Lynn Minmei. Shudder.
DMAN!
wait
and DEAD BITCH!
WOW
KABOOM
WHERE DID YOU SEE DMAN
DONE FOR
Wait... Sumica said that they're basically the same.
how fitting
WHERE WHERE
Yeah, but not what you should be looking for if you want Macross
Dermathil: I meant to type damn
DEAD GRANDMA :D
OTAKON
awww
00,10i said what?
I thought my friend was back
so how do u know what attacks ur using? unless you can read japanese
OH crap........this is not gonna be good
OH GOD PART 3 BOSS
INCOMING
OH SHIT!
FUUUUUUUU-
she's a mech!
sHES AN ANDROID?
Marcross went by the name of Robotech in US.
otakon: XD
OLD HAG EVOLVED TO MECHA OLD HAG
this is NOT good
worst hag!
And well, Robotech wasn't only Macross, was it?
Yeah, but the two are pretty much unrelated as far as the story goes, Ninjazz
00,10macross is robotech in the sence of animation
and she got two new bodyguards as well
Harmony Gold took three mecga shows, put them into a blender and made Robotech
2,14 fuck...these guys
DEM GLASSES
00,10however harmony gold amernacanised it when they dubed it
2,14 they have the highest base armor out of any non-boss enemy
oh shit
Since they needed to have enough episodes to syndicate it
Giant Dimensional Beetles
Heh.
00,10they also took two other animes and turned them in to part of the same story
Yeah
This could be ... bad Caramel
I do have one thing to say about Rainbow Factory, though.
00,10how ever even as a kid I knw somthing was off when i watched it
Can't remember what the other two were, though
11,01Night everyone.
2,14 nah, I'll prevail
Soooo. Macross > Robotech?
night Nittany_Discord sleep well
Goodnight Nittany_Discord :3
gnight Nittany_Discord!
00,10Mospedda was one of them
DAT GEASS CURSE
2,14 but Grandma might take out one of my heavy mechs if I'm not careful
night night Nittany_Discord :D
Oh, good night Nittany_Discord. Rest well. ^_^
Macross > Robotech, that's something you need to remember
OH SHIT ONE DOWN
ALREADY
11,01Thanks.
one down
00,10eh robotech was good in it's own way
daym
Avoid Robotech like plague, and only look for the shows that Robotech is made out of in their original form
so badass, he doesn't look back
GO TIERIA
MahBoi777: can you expect less of suzu-kun?
2,14 I liked robotech
nope
SERAVEE GO
Yeah, but I prefer the original stories, Sumica
woah, WHA!?
00,10and if it was't for robotech and other shows at the time anime would have never got a foot hold
2,14 bitches better watch their mouths before they badmouth it
JET BACK IS OWN ROBOT? :O
SIX-SWORDS ATTACK
wait.............IT CAN DODGE!?
Yeah, true
holy shit
SIX-SWORDS STYLE
MWAHAHAHA
oh crap that was NOT alot of damage
00,10good old tieria
Damn chat derps. >>
Tieria Erde is such a BAMF
and hit
and hit HARD
Tieria needs a heal
oh damn... that was a good amount of damage
not yet otakun
I haven't even SEEN Robotech so I don't really have any kind of opinion on it
/me pokes panda
Dermathil: dude, that was 40% of it's HP!
He can take 40% more
/me pokes BronyJenkins back :)
00,10damn that things a tank
2,14 he has a shield that mitigates damage
:3
2,14 so if he's attacked next turn, I'll just defend
need moar powah!
Dermathil: and if they get a critical? he's screewed
2,14 his shield will keep him alive
need moar railings
I've watched some of Robotech, and I've watched Macross in its entirity (except Macross II) as well as Mospeda
haven't touched the third one they had in Robotech, though
MrPoniator Anything new Animations wise
dat Caramel using "mitigates" :D
dat little kid
2,14 I really should have activated wall
oh lol
2,14 I should probably mention that if Trider dies, the universe explodes
Caramel: yes you should have, say goodbye to Trider
D:
not the universe!
so does the planet if Godmars dies
goodbye univers
ooops
and the would be terrible
well, that was a hit but not too hard
Take your time, MrPoniator. The drought's only begun.
Godmars dieing = nonstandard gameover
Well...
I'll attempt to get the season finale things out before June 15th, though
MahBoi777! howdy
Since I'll be going to Sweden for a full week or so then
MrPoniator: you are one of the creative minds that will get the community through the long ponyless summer. so, don't burn yourself out.
HEY Hodiku!
/me glomps Hodiku
Agreed with otakon.
heh
0.o oh shnap
/me is glomped. Dropped loot includes muffins and tacos.
Caramel: okay, how many of those are gonna show up in the nest stage? 20?
XD
otakon: It is indeed better if he does his work, but we went through last year's drought without any single problem. The drawfriends and fanfics and songs were all there was.
2,14 you got me
MahBoi777: it happens.
2,14 this is my first playthrough
/me is so tempted to hug Caramel
<3 Drawfiends
Oh yeah, I forgot to check your work out, MrPoniator :S
Is this "you die, character is dead permanately" thing?
2,14 bitch dont touch me
lol
I've been meaning to check it out
Caramel: you have a thing about hugs
2,14 no, with the exception of godmars and trider, all mechs are repaired at the end of a mission if they die
2,14 at the cost of money
kk
ah
O_O
DEM ???????
which robot makes the universe explode?
wow, that thing is TOUGH
Godmars and Trider
oh
/me just noticed that Granny basically mutated
O_O
WAT THE SHIT.
Reminds me of the last boss from OG1
chat derped and I heard a ping :/
wow, EVERY SKILL just to avoid getting hit
MahBoi777: You were getting glomped.:D
00,10ah this guy
and to increase attack to max otakon...
yeah, that too
Ninjazz: LOL by who?
Sumica we need a good anime stream
00,10dont look like much but hits hard
too bad it didn't do that much damage
MahBoi777: Don't remember :S
Caramel: don't you have any more team up support attacks?
awwww, dats okay
:3
/me glomps MahBoi777 in place of whoever it was,
2,14 I've got one for getter dragon and shin getter

What series is this old hag from?
Caramel: well, I meant like offensive support

MrPoniator: pretty sure she's a oC

Hodiku: O U

Dermathil: it would only be a finishing move to like... the final boss or something, that would be epic...
A finishing move to end the game itself...
Seapony Lyra defeats all

ohai Ninjazz
panda_, this is just a restream of nasa tv
a horribly broken restream
DuskStarshimmer: u having fun up there?
A horribly buffering restream.
Indeed.
Alicorn_Prince_Shane, Where I am? Did I move
oh btw repeating again, tomorrow i'm going to do a presentation about ponies and brony community in my campus :D
Spectrum_Rush: rolling is the only way for fat people to travel
http://i.imgur.com/uvPon.jpg
Phase4: oh man, cuz the live stream that I saw, it was the cam on the rocket itself XD
DuskStarshimmer: ur on my back remeber?
Oh cool, then heck yeah, this is the best day of my life!
Did Ferris Bueller have that much buffering moments?
Phase4: i will wub u forever if u stream either digimon or spider man from 60's
/me offeres Alicorn_Prince_Shane a hombaked cookie from his stachel.
gah, i'm not sure but it wont stream right
Nah, but I thought the picture was appropriate.
Hehe.
http://i.imgur.com/tKP3b.jpg
/me "thank you for ur offer DuskStarshimmer "
Dat's Whack :D
it seems nasa tv itself is breaking
eh
Tis my pleasure Alicorn_Prince_Shane
Lol
Man that is one pretty fire ball though.
/me pokes DeathStar
its probably on youtube, i'll stream that later if you guys want
mines working fine Phase4
/me dances on Spectrum_Rush s finger
/me levitates panda_
o hai lil filly
it's the most beautiful fireball I've ever seen TT_TT
I can feel the buffering leaking out of the computer and into the world.
i would link u a better one MahBoi777 but theres a stream
/me you are so small DeathStar
If this keeps up I'll become trapped in a bubble of buffered time, where a second for you is a decade for me.
Spectrum_Rush: yeah
Spectrum_Rush: she maybe small but shes fiesty
time bubblez
And then it'll wear off and I'll be in the year 5012.
Where everything is chrome.
that wud be kewl
/me tries to put DeathStar in his shirt pocket
I feel like I've watched that show before. :S
5012 was kinda a lame year actually.
OMG Phase4 !
And then Spiderman
Ow.
Like a boss.
SPIDER-MAN!
<3 U Phase4 !
dam buffer
Alicorn_Prince_Shane, i dont have any episodes sorry

/me dances in Spectrum_Rush s shirt pocket

ye panda_
You bring us the father so many horribad memes. We're doomed.
What was that web even atatched too...
attached*
you Do Not Want To Know
damnit, let me see if i cant fix it
is anyone elses stream constantly buffing eveyr 5 secs
oh shit he has a camera!
how old is this show?
Yes.
that tickles DeathStar
Older than you are probably.
so much buffer.
/me buffers...
Spectrum_Rush: well you put me in here
the buffer show
Phase4: what seems to be the problem?
Ugh, what a headache
u alright up there DuskStarshimmer ?
http://derpy.me/fUujY
DeathStar: for some raisin i didnt think you'd dance
i'm probably just going to reboot into windows, ffmpeg is still not the best tool for streaming
bufferman, bufferman, does whatever a buffer can
Here we go again.
Alicorn_Prince_Shane, I think soooo... Just kind of.. phased out of reality for a moment thar.
Ow. Again.
Spectrum_Rush: why would you think that?
panda_, upload speed seemed to be the problem
daww DuskStarshimmer
still broken
Oh my
stream y u keep buffer
ah sod it, bbl
Cya soon, Phase4.
Phase4: hm... so you have anything else open?
At least you tried Phase4

Phase4: oh man...

Aye. Remember, Phase4, don't force yourself. We're technically at your mercy, here.

Dem looters.
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Don't make me do that, please.
First off, don't be an alicorn. That's just too... unoriginal.
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: actually ponified humans are not related to skin color (my OC theory)
cause DeathStar is trying to draw me
some cuteness for your eyes my citizens http://bronies.memebase.com/2011/08/23/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-you-lose/
hmmm, name 3 colors that describe you, Shane
DeathStar: make me unicorn instead k?

DuskStarshimmer: I must admit, Fluttershy was rather cute in that episode.

Ninjazz, No brony can deny that.
DuskStarshimmer: what episode

Alright... It's a bit better now. Still getting a bit of lag here and there.

Didn't the sale end on Monday, OneTrickPony?
The sale ended a bit bofore Monday

I just wish I got it at the time
OneTrickPony: you could get an account
Heh. Didn't stop me from not getting it.
Hey Kandarihu, btw.
plus its still cheap now either way
WAIT
Phase4_: my computor is too slow right now I am waiting till I get a new one
by any chance dose anyone know what colours duskstarshimmer wanted to be?
Eh. I already played it on PS3. Don't feel like getting it again. :S
ah, its gone back up to $20
PORTAL 2 WAS ON SALE FOR $7?!
OneTrickPony: i know the feel
DARNIT, I MISSED IT D:
Eyup.
Spell-of-Gaming: yup
Last week.
So, is Wrek streaming this? Or who?
Lemme just scroll up, DeathStar.
Kandarihu: i'm streaming
Ah
Ahh welcome to a Phase4 stream, Kandarihu.
Load weed everyday.
i need to find something interesting
and stream that
portal 2 is all fine and good but still
imma get this one: http://www.digitalstormonline.com/gaminglaptoploadx15.asp?id=568648
Phase4_: Japan.
uh oh
Meanwhile: server connection problems
I saw you streaming yesterday morning. You were playing Beyond Good & Evil, so I thought I"d download it myself.
awww
Kandarihu: you should, its an excelent game
hmmm, different game?
But I'm having driver compatibility issues. Lots of graphic glitchyness. And I can't seem to get the game out of Fullscreen mode
:3
Sorry, DeathStar. Too much text to find any specific colors. :(
Kandarihu, that will happen
Meanwhile, lol, problems?
DeathStar: But I did hear Yellow and pink or that might have been Shane.
I need to find a way to put this game in a Windowed mode
Kandarihu, there isnt one
I had a brief loading delay
i looked
Then you disconnected.
Meanwhile, it told me there was connection problems
Ninjazz: yeah that;s shane but it's ok thanks for trying
/me shrugpony.
Eh. Told you it might blow up at any moment.
DeathStar: Sowwy :(
/me hugs Ninjazz it's ok :)
tf2 time?
XAX, you there/
/me hugs DeathStar back :3
On the bright side, think of how good you are at science.
ah, he's ingame
FOR SCIENCE!
Meanwhile, ^_^
I'm going to dance off to bed now good night everypony

Gnigth DeathStar! Don't be a moon!
Night DeathStar

Let's see if my computer still has enough strength to run TF2.
i'ma join xax in tf2
if shane of duskstarshimmer comes on can you tell them the I losr dusks colours?
or*
04I should probably stop what I'm doing
Needs to be about 20% more Sumerpan. http://i.imgur.com/jCrJx.jpg
04Lest I begin to feel sick again
Sure, DeathStar. :)
What're you doing Ghosties?
Time for a break, Ghosties. :$
/me dances out of chat "good night everypony"
awww, servers full
04Looking at a bunch of videos of gameplay footage of incredibly obscure Mortal Kombat knock-offs from the early to mid 90's
DODGEBL
DODGEBALL;
lolwut.
you'll like this
im back o3o
once it loads
and whats going on?
/me used to rock the house at dodgeball games.
welcome back LightTrooper105
/me doesn't play sports but is pretty good at them
04Thea Realm Fighters, Bloodstorm, and Catfight are really bad looking but Tattoo Assasins is the absolute *worst*
Before that tragic accident with the waffle iron anyway.
Tattoo assasins?...
Ninjazz: Dodgeball is a custom TF2 game mode.
Oh.
04I remember I sat through a fatality video for Tattoo Assassins alone that was about 15 minutes long
Involving homing missiles airblasts and rampant gibbing.
/me feels like an idiot now.
note that i suck at this game but its still fun
dat mouse
04I felt nauseous after I was done
i hear sound and only see the mouse..
omfg dat mouse is sexy
Not just me seeing the black screen then
Wonder why that is.
ooooo myyyy goooosshhhh
I hear the smexy boice PIE RO.
/me staring at boice
umm wut
Phase4 something might be wrong seeing only blackness and sound.
Yeah. Mortal Kombat really kicked off the Western Fighting Game craze. All of them vying to be bloodier and gorier and more shockingly violent than Mortal Kombat. Whether the other ones succeeded was a moot point, because they weren't fun
XD
instadead
allso i cant rotate
blackness?
I'd totally try and get in on this dodgeball game if I didn't have a bus to catch in 20 minutes.
DeathStar: y u no sleep?
Let's just agree that Mortal Kombat was the best of the bunch.
yes Phase4 now i see a mouse.
Yeah Phase4 we're getting a mouse and a black screen.
DuskStarshimmer|Zzz: is asleep DeathStar
Phase4: no video
oh damnit
pure entertainment! keep it up bro!
what is happening?
04The makers of the game boasted that Tattoo Assassins had, and I shit you not, 2,196 fatalities
Seems like we got some technical difficulties.
i see the mouse is making a ruckus
hello everyone
Got a meme for that Meanwhile?
Admittedly, the sounds of flying rockets and airblasts and MMPHMM are quite funny.
is that you talking...... who's talking?
Hey Giger4444!
gah, stupid game
Ninjazz: A meme for what?
hey guys ill bbl ok :D
ohai Gigen4444
Meanwhile: Technical Difficulties
Bye Alicorn_Prince_Shane.
take care Alicorn_Prince_Shane.
Cya Alicorn_Prince_Shane! Stop being an alicorn.
04I mean, how are you gonna come up with 2,196 fatalities? And further, how would you implement all of them in a single system board
On the other hoof, are those music mods on server or your own, Phase4?
Yesterday night we talked about staying up late, or for staying up for 48 hours and such. Now I am up for the 30th hour and its starting to show :D

04Oh my lord, the political incorrectness of Western fighters in the 90's is hilarious
I would if I could hear it.
Wrek, you feeling ok?
Reminds me of dubstep dishwasher.
All I know about that song is Bass Cannon
05yeh
Ahhh Dat Basscannon!
Anything airing besides music?
04You can play as a prostitute in a game called "Time Slaughter" where her post match win quote is "My pimp hits harder than you!"
Wrek, bug me when you want to take over, i'm just gona stream music for a bit
(\
Forgot about that. :)
and now for something completly different
So more Portal 2 is out of the question?
Phase4 is streaming OMG!!!
Hey Mutterguy!
Ghosties, Skype?
/me hugs Mutterguy|Sleep
05ill take over afer maintinance
HI Ninjazz
OOPS
this program reminds me of fast tracker :D
oh the memories
Dat Bass Cannon song... Where did you get it, Phase4? I must have it.
Ninjazz, google 'bass cannon extended', its not the actual song, just bits and pieces pasted together
04Fucking fuck, man
brb
04"Too bad I didn't lose...I like lying flat on my back."
Thanks, Phase.
/me hugs Phase4 back
Wtf Ghosties o.o
05gotta love it ghosties
Ty?
04Again, another win quote from the prostitute character from the fighter "Time Slaughter"
Hey.
Doing good?
Yes thanks, you?
back
Been better, but good. Thank you. :)
04Oh, that makes sense. The game was made by a couple of sixteen year olds
That's what happens when you have hormones make a game.
Nevermind then. BBL.
dammit why do I always want to click on the recommendations in the stream window?
Wow. Dat irony
Giger4444, solved ^_^
04There's even a modern website for the game where you can download it in its entirety -_-
lol No thanks.
:)
this song is called 'elements of harmonics' btw
Yes... Now I can make mods with Just Mah BASS CANNON!
THE POWER IN MAH HANDS!
y u default to 360p youtube
Sexy Octavia.
Indeed.
ohai Octavia
/me kneels
05ok ready Phase4
05just say when
i like this song
So, you were having problems with Beyond Good & Evil glitching up too?
I like this pony.
Kandarihu, yeah
...element of harmonics, by chain algorithm?
dshannon, yup
boom
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqB1MbXSeGk << link
http://www.gog.com/en/forum/beyond_good_and_evil/graphical_difficulties
I got it in my media player playlists
Guys, does anyoneknow a game called "Outlive"?
Kandarihu, are you on a multi core machine?
Yes
Wrek, ready
Kandarihu, thats half your problem, the games engine is not thread safe
This song. I can't grasp it's form
lol element of harminics without harmony?
dat wow
....
I tried merely turning off the HW Vertex Processing. That stopped the glitching, but also caused a lot of lag.
Phase: You nailed it.
So I went by the whole guide. I"m going to see how well it works.
Kandarihu, i've found that the more powerfull the gpu, the less problems you get
allso fouind zero problems when running within wine on linux
Malavolent, XD
wow and diablo look so similar to me
Good morning everypony! :)
Hey RaveBrony!
ohai RaveBrony
The character screen does look similiar.
Kandarihu, thats why i'm guessing its a threading issue, opengl on wine is explicitly synchronised, on windows theres no such luck
Even the objectives, messages... ok, it's from the same company.
Eh.
/me never played WoW
Who is streaming? :o
/me doesn't have plans to play Diablo 3 either
RaveBrony: Wrek.
/me only played during the Wotlk expansion
Diablo 3 is overrated.
Oh, i thot it was, just making sure :P
I agree.
I think I'll go rest my back for a bit.
You hurt your back Ninjazz?
I'm enjoying Diablo 3
Cya, Ninjazz.
Hello, everypony
Hater's gonna hate
RaveBrony: Nope. My chair doesn't have a backside on it so it's basically a stool on wheels.
Ninjazz: Ouuuuch >.<
mostly unrelated note: if anyone here has a newer laptop with 'nvidia optimus
Ninjazz: You should invest into a new one.
herp derp enter
Indeed. I should...
Ninjazz: Yeah, you should go rest your poor back then... :\
My back is begging for one!
can't judge about something until i tried it, except alcoholic drink and drugs lol
Since you spend a lot of time on it, I guess.
with optimus, you will need to force all the .exe 's in the bge folder to use the dedicated card
Aye. I'll go do that, RaveBrony.
Level 53 Demon Hunter :D
/me saw optimus and immediately assumed transformers. alas.
^ same :D
So... according to Know your meme there are 800 000 bronies total.
So, from what ive been told, you cant enter fun little random make games in D3 like you could in D2? O.o
Not sure what you mean RaveBrony, but you can join public games
Malavolent i think that factioid has a expiry date
LucidDream: did you play Diablo 2?
Yes
Mutterguy: I think there are more of us.
05random make games?
I guess you can't join 'random games', because you can pick what quest you want to do in a public game
yes indeed. you have to consider the time of writng
and it finds people around your level on that quesat
quest*
Wrek: Ah, i cant really explain it.... :\
When I look at the succesful brony meetups, I wish there was one in my country.
Diablo is awesome
Sumica Hey... *poke poke*
ohai Nabronyan
Hello
Oh and Hi everypony.\
Hello BlazeAngel!
k i back, I just finished making a 20 min mix
and hai BlazeAngel
Like, in Diablo 2, you would go to battlenet and just make a name and password and enter a game? You know, to have everything respawn?....or can you like, do that automatically?
I'd rather go to a convention or a VA panel. But the closest one is about 10000 kilometers away :D
hiya BlazeAngel
Is tehre a mod here today?
You can start on any quest you have already got to RaveBrony
Well, Wrek is streaming atm, BlazeAngel.
I heard from my brother that you can make real money off of Diablo 3
Is this true?
Anybody else Ninjazz
In theory.... The real money Auction house isn't up yet
:L
Nabronyan: You can make real money off of every game.
oh well back to drawing :D
Nope
Not Tetris
Ill tell ya how.
BlazeAngel: just not every method is legal :D
No, its legal.
Sell it. Trolololol.
LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLO
OH GOD IT'S 6:30 WHAT IS THIS
/me didn't see that one coming
LucidDream: Start on any quest? O.o so i cant make a "Dropping random rare items" game? D:
that's not making money, thats cutting losses :D
Eh, I'll come back later
In my case, it's giving back wasted time.
Hello.
Ok, go ahead.
I have a couple mankinds that will benefit question.
(not realleh)
Shouldn't that be ponykind?
SHH
Wait
Since we're bronies
And not ponies
Shouldn't we say
Bronykind?
extracting ponies from equestria to real world?
Alright. Alright. I know when to take a joke.
Ninjazz: On the internet noone knows you're a pony.
little bit of tf2, then work then bed
benefits are the right of all sentient beings (including robots)
Hint i mean.
or dinner
either way
robots are sentient? well time to build a nuclear shelter...
Is it wrek playing?
Malavolent: Well, I'm actually just a retired ninja who happens to play the sax, so in a sense I am not a pony. I just live among them. :D
Twist ending to mass effect 3?
Yes, LucidDream.
Ninjazz: Of course you are :D
I count two celestian class crusers at three to one range... at those odds Ill take three.... make that four derpys...
Ahh, is he going to play online at all? I could help him :DD
My video is brokeded- Nvm
My DH is named Scootaloo

Eyep. Makes RPing interesting if so need be.

I'm writing my response.
I am a mare mortal.
Get it?

I don't need a mod's opinion to see that, Mutterguy. :D
*rimshot*
