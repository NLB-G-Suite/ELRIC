Saturn: I feel sorry for you. :(

Bam
K.O
Saturn: drink lots of fluids and purge dammit
hm
Always with the cliffhangers
Saturn: You feel sick?? D:
8,1ChrysaMaid: i'm not sure... it might have been the 1 year old burgers i defrosted earlier...
AutoZone closes at 10...prolly won't make it LOL
8,1but it must have been from before that, actually
Saturn: undercooked?
Saturn: That'd do it alright.
8,1because i had this pain last night too
Why Saturn WHY?
...
Gnight everypony
8,1ChrysaMaid: because i have a strong constitution!
different day*
8,1in all honesty, i do it all the time, and it never causes me problems

8,1CupcakeWarrior: still need to study

Saturn: take some stomach pills or something
hiya Rain
8,1otakon: that's disgusting; but i've not had anything come out either end, really
11,01And use my pony OC.
/me hugs Rain
8,1superretroworld: stomach... pills?
07o3o
go fix the stats now
Saturn: pills that cures stomach aches i meant
LOL
07I told you that didn't fix it lol
^
and acceptance.
You changed it in all the themes?
8,1so if it was cooked, then left out, then that's bad
And the main theme as well?
8,1but if you nuke the shit out of it, it'll be fine
Because that should have fixed it
I feel like dancing
hi
Dances
time?
Saturn: it was old deer roast that I ate that was sitting out in 90 degree weather then cooked
Ok, gotta go everypony......college first thing in the morning......SHOW (is) OFF
TIMING!
Isnt it maid hour?
Already there
inb4hacking
no maid hour anymore.
whatisit?
11,01Maid Hour is taking a break.
8,1otakon: there are some toxins that won't be gotten rid of by cooking
Making a shell script, as I'm on Mint12 now
bye
ok
8,1but you won't get an infection from properly cooked meat
lol mint 12
Saturn: yeah, I figured
/me dislikes mint 12
8,1so it's mostly likely that it was the undercooking, rather than the leaving out
11,01It really depends if people can stop RPing in here.
Is there gonna be another ep?
Saturn: I cooked it until it was damn near burnt, two hours at 350 degrees F
LOLNOPE
I can do it but I haven't actually really looked into it
07there's a preview in the css editor, when I changed any of the themes it didn't help fix it
8,1otakon: burnt on the outside, or burnt the whole way through?
ok
Saturn: cooked through, slightly burnt outside
pretty simple, I just need it to do love-unstable ~/desktop/mari0_1.6.love and then kill Cinnamon and restart it
I'm okay with less rp.
10^
Saturn: no idea, but the blood was cooked clear. This happened like 7 years ago
no more stream tonight?
Octavia~<3
I don't know *how* to kill a process from terminal
kill pid
ok sooooo
Man, Ristar is fun
or you can use killall process-name
07I'll do it when I have time
8,1otakon: aye. when cooking a whole roast like that, it's generally a good idea to check the internal temperature with a food thermometer
oh that works, hi everyone
and you'll need sudo most likely
lol okay
But for some reason, it creeps me out a bit...
it does need fixing though
07I actually have work I need to do for the next couple weeks lol
first time here! hows everyone
lol
and yes i did
8,1there's like < 10C difference between breeding and killing temperatures
11,01Mild /me dusts /me cleans is fune.
11,01*fine
..........and no one bothered to say hi to me....
well it'll only take about 5 minutes but okay

07well if I can't trust the preview feature then I'd rather not mess around with something I'm not good with lol
I should've tried four dollars instead of five...
:)
Well
>Angry Birds underwear
this fad is a bit obnoxious
8,1night night
Well I was on the Ho-Oh theme
07but changing it to the one you told me to on the other themes didn't work
1,3food, then zombies
I experienced the same feeling while playing Ristar
O_O 8:30? great...now I'll be up all night

8,1twilight_sprinkler: Feynmann lectures
Luna: well, you should get some sleep then dear. You don't want to stress yourself out.

Role Playing
8,1twilight_sprinkler: i can recommend some books on qauntum electrodynamics-- actually, if you want to know about particle physics, join lhcportal.com
8,1twilight_sprinkler: the lhcportal wiki is amazing, but currently down, as it's hosted on one of my servers that's not available at the moment
8,1twilight_sprinkler: also, the irc channel is pretty cool
OFC you're killing my bread and butter
/me 10will always reccommend Six Easy Pieces and Six Not-So-Easy Pieces by Feynmann, when it comes to Physics Literature
10recommend*
13speaking of physics literature
Hugh Laurie got 700,000 dollars per episode this season
8,1which is well worth a read

The whole supply...
00,10Will start up stream here shortly, just have to finish one thing
8,1i've never liked A Brief History of Time
ow physics hurts my tiny brain
8,1i think it's written kinda clunkily
Good lord thats like... lets see... 100m....
Waiting is easy when a stream is promised
8,1twilight_sprinkler: yup
13it's A Brief History Of Time, but revised i think
13to make it clearer or something
10@Saturn, about the LHC document, did you mean this? http://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/1017689/files/ab-note-2007-014.pdf
