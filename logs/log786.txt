13he looks pretty cool
royal_bee: Oh, I know that Youtube poop, I'm looking for you right now :)
Shizuka: He's probably being called Shizuka-chan as a reference to Shizuka from Doraemon.
Iwa, I would be very, very grateful! because I've already searched a lot but I can't seem to find it ;_;
13that was it
/me hugs thelonecubone back.

pony_4908: It's on now. It won't be on tomorrow.

I don't know why, but I could easily see Ron Pearlman in this role
12 years old!
o-e
why she's almost a pensioner!
Sundaysmile: As the presidant? ... Yeah, maybe.
In the cavemen days you'd have G1 to watch. We call that progress.

Yes do you like Crash?
Can they even fly a plane?
Sundaysmile: But not the one Bronystate deserves?
Sundaysmile: no the anti hero is the hacker im the second best
Maybe I'm getting loopy in the head
Bronystate's anti-hero position is already filled by a number of people. :D
Wait, the VP... what was that actress name? Glenn Close?
holy shit
Just swear in the VP already and use the self destruct
/me rolls on a barrel

GilDash:...........................HI

LoGaN: ... Holla! :)
i have lead in my room...
I see there is a stream.
She ded
If your ellipsis has more than four dots, you're doing something wrong...
13i do have to question how a terrorist would get on air force one in the first place
1. Terrorists and 2. Air Force One
13it's not exactly a public plane
What are we watching?
/me pokes GilDash o3o
that girl next to his daughter
air force one
who is that?
/me also pokes GilDash
/me pokes thelonecubone right back.
dat was close
It said that they killed a group of Russian reporters, and forged their identifications.
Shizuka: The answer is "Use gun". And if that won
/me also pokes LoGaN back.
-won't work, "Use more gun/"
But who was Pod?
As for Crash games on PS2, I played only CNK and CTTR, so I don't know these
13president jones!
DAMMIT MR. PRESIDENT
Oh hey, it's president Ford! wait...

13THANKS DOCTA PRESIDENT
He hid in the smuggling compartments :D
Well well well wello well well wll
And now it's time to punch terrorist dick!
LoGaN: Tsk, now that's just rude.
I liked Spyro DOTD too, but my favourite from the TLOS trilogy is still EN ^^
OKI DOKI DOCTA JONES
i..swear to dunkr, i'm...uh...clestia
GilDash: my real name is logan...
/me I'm here to kill terrorists and do the Kessle run in under 12 parsects, AND I'M ALL OUT OF PARSECTS!
how do they fire all those guns without hitting the side of the aircraft?
Please refrain from smoking in the aircraft lavatories. :|
LoGaN do you have claws as well
yes!
Twinsanity is a great game even Titans, yeah I liked EN mostly for its plot and you get to play as dark spyro.
Sneaky president is sneaky...
And quite careless of his life
/me unleashes a hoard of parasprites
LoGaN: That gives you the excuse to punch people in the face?
metal gear ford
O.O GLEN CLOSE HAS A HUGE HEAD
And aren't there a small army of secret service agents on airforce 1
GilDash: yes
Splinterr Cell: Air Force One
/me I'm sorry, did you just say Air Force Juan?
Fl00t4sh41: You mean the dead ones?
Ah good times, when SC was actually a stealth game...
Should be enough to deal with a dozen hijakers

Ah, ok, thank you
Yeah, the new ep was on a few hours ago.
We found the excape pod; It's full of the Presidental Cheese

I didn't play any of these, because it is too expensive
Presidential cheese?
is the stream lagging for anyone else?
i wonder if it tastes like egoraptor
herpderp
or obama
cachi01: Gift from Sheogorath
lel
I'll have to wait until it is cheaper
The president has flown chopers in war. Clearly he's an expert at handling weapons and hand to hand combat
lol
cachi01: Cheddar A. Arthur
/me so many smuggling compartments

Have you played Univverse?

GilDash: actually worked well all the time for me, dont know what happens that keeps lagging :(

BRB
Good thing he set an alarm for the President's escape-the-conference-room agenda.
Stallion_of_War: Oh, I'm not complaining... well I am, but you know what I mean.
cachi01|walkingdead: you gotta look out for the walkers, Rick

13that's it i'm becoming president
Shizuka, Air Force One has EVERYTHING
The president is pretty spry for an old fellar
lag D:
Awww is this movie still going? :(
Of course it has beer; The President' doesn't need to be sober or anything... it's not like he/she needs to have a clear head to run the country...
He used to be a professor of archaeology.
Shizuka: There's a catch: It's all a light beer
13noooooooooo
thelonecubone: I have :)
13well when i'm president that's the first thing to go

13"Gary Oldman did not stay in character between the scenes. The director later said he called the filming experience 'Air Force Fun' because of how comedic and genial Oldman would be off-screen. He also said that Oldman would suddenly return to the menacing film persona like a shot."

He's usually more successful with a gun when aiming at swordsmen. >_>

true
but refreshing a few times helps
it is laggy tho

13delayed due to lack of availability
wait, Its Muliplayer as well :O
Kammerjunk: mine too, but with extra mysterious presents! :$
Too bad I didnt know. I was curious of this movie. Ah well...
Games in Australia are like $80 for a triple A title /).(\

PresidentGanjalf: I liked the basic concept of an alien invasion, the over patriotic MURIKA'-ness ruined it for me.
What's happening?
they gotta work on Both things aswell
thelonecubone, I'm ok with this, I would probably enjoy the singleplayer more than the multiplayer anyway
MURICA
Kammerjunk: Perrydotto was in the pre-stream, and we got along really well at BUCK, so now she's giving me a present too <3

Dat terrible CGI

This CGI
such great effects
umm... no thats not how a plane crashes in water
13other than the approach that was actually pretty good
XTREME WATER SKIING TIME :D
And they left him strapped like that for the rest of the flight.
13any other movie would make it explode despite having no fuel
President is off the plane
One more year left till you can drive :3
and in water
come now, lets be serious, what do any of us know about water phyiscs
all of this movie's budget in that 15 second sequence
Well Michael Bay didn't direct this one. :P
death by plane crash? bitch please zipline it out
Hehe, drive
13mrs vice president, THE PRESIDENT GOT OFF HIS PLANE
twilight_sprinkle: well your name .... >_>
Was this a july 4 movie too?
I still need to get my L's /).(\
WE GOT HIMN
but he want's a new one

Shinzuka: If it was Michael Bay, the plane would explode about 4 times WITH no fuel.
/me gives AdamTheDuck L :P
shaped like a giant flying gun
13can i tell you guys to get off this plane?
shizuka you want ot say that in real life now huh
QBAlchemist: well, ive not studied water physics myself yet :P
Wait, the refueling aircrafts callsign was LIBERTY?

Next week they go zip lining ;)
Seriously?

Oh that's right, Euro movie night is on
QBAlchemist: bt i will catch up to twilight some day!
Double thumbs up!
13Fl00t4sh41: military callsigns aren't particularly creative
eeyup
twilight_sprinkle: lol ... fair enough
Still
Saddle Arabia :D love the puns
AdamTheDuck: dat's rite!
13in any case, any plane the president is on immediately becomes air force one, even if it's not the usual airliner
xD
Close the hatch so people don't fall out. D:
technically any plane that the president is on beecomes AF1
random jets where did you go
god lord, how uch furl tdo those jets have?

13first a moment of silence

13for that guy
terrible
It can't get any more action-packed than that without becoming cheesy.
QBAlchemist: I mostly agree, though I think you are bring a bit generous
I think it's funny season premiere was 6000 bronys and the movie night is only 200
what movie is next????????????????????
That one guy? Yeah.
13THAT GUYYYYYYYYYYYY ;A;
wasnt bad, but the effects were apparent and the physics were low ... so 5/10
Alchemist: why
Ah yes.
* _ *
The song of my people.
Shizuka: The guy that wasn't allowed on his plane? :(
199 bronies and a pegasister :D

13DESU DESU DESU
YES!
lol Mordecai
Of course thats going to make a lot of ships
cant blame them, spike's crush on rarity is pretty cute :3
Brother_Aura: by who?
you overdid didn't you?
and then shizu was banned
Wrek.
As soon as I saw this scene Fluttershy was my favourite pony.
Brother_Aura: that explains itseld
*itself
lol
I have to admit
Fluttershy was my favorite at first
LOUDER!
but now I saw the truth
awkward silence time
0,5O BBY
Is he a moderator in jiggly's funhouse?
rainbow dash was my favorite pony since i started watching
i dislike fluttershy even more after today
OH hello Worst pony.
CRAP
Rarity is clearly the superior and best all-around pony
have you noticed how fluttershy was the only one twilight took an interest in off the back
NO! I'm allergic to adorableness....awww that squee *dies*
She just reminds me of me :)
Wrek yields no mercy for the weak
made the joke anyway ._.
Fluttershy has and always had been my favorite
CrystalPhoenix: indeed.
RawketLawnchair: There is now worst pony
CrystalPhoenix: same here. She was my number 1 ever since this scene.
*no
Not sure if that's good or not...
I havent seen domo in weeks ;3;
Domo*
Wingboner.
Spoiler for the next episode: There are ponies
dragony stuff
CrystalPhoenix: I started hating Rarity for being so annoyingly girly girly. But she grows on you and now she's my favourite of the mane 6
D'awwww she's so cute ^_^
Fl00t4sh41, pretty much
to be quite frank, this whole best pony business is silly
Rarity is complex
FlutterMEDIC: Ikr
:D
SWEEPY....
i love that scene
CrystalPhoenix: that should be a movie; The RARTIY COMPLEX
The change started around the time she bucked the charging manticore
Fl00t4sh41: I've heard that story a lot. Rarity probably has the most character of the 6.
inb4 Derpy
:O
in b4 derpy
Socks: And then some
pinkie pie :3
Derpy AND Lyra :#
lyra found her
*:3

Herpdederpy
that's why she's easily hateable but then you learn her motive and what drives her
:P
were's derpy
Socks: twilight has a Lot of character
there she is
I want Domo too .3.
i've yet to see a bonafide derpy in S3
"These ponies are the reason I drink"
CrystalPhoenix: easilt hateable? wtf
DRUNK PONIES
then you understand how Rarity is the most mature, well-maintain pony
You shall NOT PASS...The GREAT and Powerful Gandalf~! :D http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JfW8rNt9oDw/ULoYRM_yDEI/AAAAAAAAniA/OIrcVUpfSso/s640/2VP6G.jpg

Fl00t4sh41: that or she is a troll
cliff hanger!
dude pony 4908 that was fast
next on the list
If NMM hadn't dealt with celestia, why isn't it the first thing she does upon returning?
also me likes rainbow dash in the cockpit
i so totaly hope that twilight can band together with the other mares and overpower night mare moon and break her shell ...
lol remember Freakazoid? http://thedailyoat.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/pinkazoid.png :D
Fl00t4sh41: wait. do you have any reliable source of that theory?
05ooo GSL finals in 1½ hours
heya Is Mlp season 3 episode 5 out yet?
Just the circumstances we see
Sketch_Toku_Brony: the forth wall is not safe :O
Fl00t4sh41: Perhaps Celestia deliberately did not intervene, since she had sorta been waiting for her beloved sister to return after 1000 years?
yes it is

pony_4908: It could be the result of the battle between the princesses when NMM was banished
damn you RD

the equivalant of fallout from a magical nuclear exchange
hey bronies i just got my idiot mother home from the airport

Idiot mother?
one does not simply insult their mother
...and then twilight died, the end!
How about : "Let go,one of the Pegasi is gonna catch you"

pinkie pie doesn't need magic she just breaks physics

http://rlv.zcache.com/duck_and_cover_postcard-p239374307223087744envli_400.jpg
MY MOUSTAAAACHE!

discord?
13MOOSTASH
BladedWings: read my comment till you understand it ;)
Mah fabulous moostach!
13rarity is missing her cue
Stahp it.
cachi01: ah, from Fallout :D

13OF ALL THE WORST THINGS THAT COULD HAPPEN
cachi01: We should stream that propaganda vid once
How does he keep his hair so perfectly when its always wet?
thelonecubone: hmmmm...*stares at the comment*
oh wow, i'm so behind :D
13now... really.. why would nightmare moon think this would impede our heroines
thelonecubone: nope, it's actualy real one
Ded
Shizuka: Appearently she doesn't know about metrosexuality.
and there was so much blood, we just slid down the mountain!
13now it doesn't match
Shizuka perhaps she throat she they woukd drown in the lake?
lol
MAH MOOSTACH!
tis what I thought
Shizuka: Maybe she thought he'd be enraged rather than saddedend
SMASHING http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5dmirpMzT1r8nk72.gif
must smell great
dafuck
Babs Seed tail!?
She's got a babs tail.

13see and now there's a perfect bridge
thelonecubone: *says like twilight* i dont get it...she treats me well if thats what you me...and visa versa
13nightmare moon is almost a worse villain than sombra
Shizuka: lol maybe he'll get some purple streaks through the other onee to match :D
And enraged river serpent would have been a heck of an obstacle
nopony is worst villain than sombra
Sundaysmile: Truth
yeah nightmare moon........ you could just simply use your magic.....and you know........kill them or something
Discord was a foal cmpared to Sombra >_>
Come with us Raaaainbooow...
like our voices don't scare you
or anything
CountDoofus: Obvious Troll is obvious
13oo look he's evading klines
You don't say :D
Is that Tabitha St. Germain?
Sounds like her.
so are the shadow bolts real or just ficticious
pony_4908: yep
Michael: They're illusions created by Nightmare Moon.
or you know.......use your magic to fix the bridge...
no I mean
BladedWings: did you get it?
like does luna have her own team
Why doesn't NMM just magically weaken the ropes so they'll fall when they try to cross?
Michael: they are luna's OC
xD
Michael: Nope. The actual Wonderbolts serve royal duties in times of emergency. They're like, the go-to RAF of Equestria.
because that would be over pg
Michael: Maybe she used to have her own team?
13it means wait for the plot to develop
The elements of marmalade
thelonepony: umm i think...but i think it should be talked about in private :D
BladedWings: naw dont,
the element.............OF TROLLING!!!!!!
13wrong spark
BladedWings: at least you get was i was implying :D
The... Twilight Zone

I like Nightmare Moon more than I do Luna.
13I'VE ABANDONED MY BOY! I'VE ABANDONED MY CHILD!
Ooops. The elements just kind of broke, didn't they
What crappy construction
why does NMM get so small when she turns into luna?
13>reassured
13>honesty
13wut
shes the element of [honesty]!
BlankFlank: She gets depowered
Shizuka: logic
A DINGO ATE MAH BABY.
I used to think nightmare moon had bat wings
So.. Celestia could turn into a 'small version' aswell?
spirit of happiness would've been better :I
"LOYALTY"
Shizuka: AJ was never very good at honesty, was she?
they all arent perfect at their elements
pony_4908: Well, someone in the army who acts like a dick, is still loyal to his country :P
13that uh
dun dun dun
13twilight's making this up as she goes
I've read a theory that the elements they embody is more a matter of what they try to be, than what they naturally are
xD
13TASTE THE RAINBOW
AJ want's to be honest and dependable
you said it to early
ded
GET OFF MY EQUESTIA!
Michael: no we're just behind
Even if she doesn't always succeed

So... she used them to get her sister back...
13the others are like "oh god it's the princess, bow down"
oh k then
And as usual, Celestia does nothing...
onix: we already watched the 1st, 2nd is in about 10-15 mins oor so
Praise the sun!
13twilight's like "pff we're on first name basis"
lies
How dare you not bow before Queen Horse Purple Magic.
Your death will be slow.
And brutal.

FRIEND
Oh no it's the worst princess.
13>opening monologue describes sisters, one of which is banished in the moon
13>monologue is twilight's book
<3
13>WHY DID TWILIGHT NOT RECOGNIZE LUNA AS CELESTIA'S SISTER
soulrider95: UNACCEPTABLEEEEEE
I'M SO SORRY
Pinkie:D
Gotta wonder just how thoroughly Luna got written out of the history books
she's so much shorter
No! - 10000 years DUNGEON!
A PARTY
http://ponybot.net/?i=5895
yay
While she was banished
...
Someone play Alex S.

it's like the crystal empire,they just kinda forgot after 1000 years
Shizuka: cause pilot episodes lack of moderfakin continuityyy
True. Sombra wasn't redeemed or cast away. He was blown to fucking shit. :P
ALEX S MELTING POT OF ALCOHOL
I WANT IT
13http://i.imgur.com/8QmIp.gif
David Tennant: I don't wanna go :(
yay
well, his horn pulled some funny stuff after ihe sploded

Shizuka: Princess Celestia is an avid belliever in the power of historical revisionisn, and Celestia taught Twilight history
Shizuka: xD
The_TCR_Engineer you can't have my booze
lol Pinkie
until lesson zero and magic kindergarten lol
wtf
alexxm|foal: Its music not booze
4th wall
13Fl00t4sh41: but, then the book shouldn't have mentioned luna being her sister
13I AM FONCUS
that's the second time she's broken the 4th wall today
first time pinkie breaks the 4th wall
Did I miss the restream of the new episode or no?
Shizuka: That wasn't politically convenient, so it wasn't included
Shizuka, these are dangerous thoughts you are thinking.
There's a reason the Thought Police think for you.
newest mlp episode was hilarious XD
It all makes sense now.
20 minutes of pure randomness begin now

Cinder-Ella
I was going to go into Networking Technologies. Programming and Logic was one of the requirements.
this movie involves racism
cider ella
Thinking it was reletively simple, I idiotically went into it xD
cachi01: Nope. Not regularly. I only did a few when I had access to a computer that could do it
ah...
And she likes Pina Coladas, getting caught in the rain....and I'll go no further singing that song :)
RACISM!
*relatively
Logic is important stuff though

HEY! It's Costanza!
I HATE MY LIFE
Finshed my picture http://i.imgur.com/3zoAd.png ^_^

The New York Times on the multi-racial cast: (The fact that this racial utopia exists in a fairy tale only emphasizes its distance from reality.

That's a bright suit...
Dark92Enigma: Well when I was younger, I didnt know it was bd.
Cant let those mean numbers and symbols win.

Nice :3
You'll be fine, dear, just use the fainting couch like usuall

Rrrrrrrubish!
These are actually clothes I remember seeing at this year's Renaissance Fair.
song
Personally I like this Cinderella uwu
Oh dont we all
Love and marriage love and marriage go together like a horse and carriage~
The evil step mother has a point
I don't have a problem with it, it's just... I'm used to Cinderella... not... being... black...
and also that ''im gonna report you for being mean'' thing.........seriously?
Nittany_Discord you go to renaissance fairs!? NOOOeeeeeeerd :P
thats actually a legit thing
Cindy would make a great pocahantas (sp?)
yep
but in this chat
Last month.

...Meanwhile is going to eat this kid's soul.
eeyup

fr4nky: It's not that it's a musical... it's just that the songs are so bland.
Meanwhile is a user...
Reikim: oh lawd

...Apple green!?
...
SO they are vomiting?!
poniesarecoolyay: we have a user named Meanwhile
It's apple red!

Dayu,

THe point is, the prince fell for her, REGARDLESS if she was a princess or not.
after resignation
You gotta flick your wrist left, not right
Power overwhelming.
teenage mutan ninja pumkin
Ooooohhhh look at that CGI
lol kirzstryfe
>.>
didn't you take any magic classes?
Those effects mmm
LadyCanary but she looked like a princess to the point that nobody reconqized her
that is scary
13psst LadyCanary <3 http://i3.minus.com/inu3jzWbcvPfX.jpg
EXACTLY Deadlypon3. But when she tried on the slipper, he knew.
was the movie raffle yet?
:3 Muffins, Shizuka.
kirzstryfe, the PunchMaster.
Shizuka: any of those pie flavoured?
Raeg
LadyCanary Muffins are good
the dress
HENSHIN
whoa. Cinderella III: A Twist in Time sounds like the best fanfic ever.
we should all be frends
poniesarecoolyay: Register your nick.
LadyCanary and why is it always a blue dress?
How would spinning help a transformation spell?
...Dressgasm
>Friends
or better yet
13is it me or does she look like whats her name from that princess and the frog movie
I WANT THAT DRESS
Nope.avi
hmmm
Is it possible to create glass slippers?
aniderp: Yep
Shizuka: She does! Tiana.
Nobody is friends in here, anyway.
So beautiful
Deadlypon3: Because thats what teh old disney cartoon had
Shizuka she looks exactly like the Disney Classic Fox and the hound
Dawswithrainbows are you rainbow dash?
fact
i like rainbow dash
Friends? On BronyState?
13the resemblance is...
what are the movies for next friday?
....
Deadlypon3: depends
Jageman: geting all of her
Deadlypon3 but why does THAT have blue?
We kind of just collectively mock each other in a vaguely friendly fashion.
Yush
13i get the feeling they based the design on her
Tiana Shizuka?
Why does it matter Deadlypon3.
Preposterous.
Shizuks tianna?
LadyCanary cause everything is POSSIBLE
PROSSIBRU
POSSIBRU POSSIBRU!
AT THE GALA
DashWithRainbows is in fact Ronbow Dash.
Algent: lol ... pross XD
*Dosh
What is, AdamTheDuck?
It makes sense Shizuka.

And boy do I enjoy mocking people.
Cause I wanna make a glass slipper Oh bongo drums

Shuddup baby, I know it.
how to: tab
"poniesarecoolyay: we should all be frends" >Preposterous.
Blaze666: That only kinda makes sense. But i guess magic does not need to make sense.
Shizuka: Or it's disney being disney and trying to be politically correct in the most radical ways...*shrug*
like a stuck record
In NY, Cinderella is gonna come back on Broadway >w<
Oh no, it's not preposterous at all.
and ohai AJIsAwesome :P
I really want to see it.
Jageman it makes things prossibru
Hi, AdamTheDuck. :D
Ok, back from my shower...how much did i miss? XD
Deadlypon3: Yes, its possible to make them, but not practical to wear
So if Cinderella is walking around on glass shoes, how do they not shatter under her weight when she walks?
Also, you've never seen me, poniesarecoolyay, only Scoot-Scootaloo has.
LadyCanary: I would see it
meh one of them did not hold that note well
*yawn
Cypresswolf wouldn't the glass crack and dig into your feet?!

Why has Scoot-Scootaloo seen you, of all people?
Oh the SLy 2 Dance sequence!
Deadlypon3: yes

Ronbow Dosh http://fav.me/d5kpns2

It's the Rodgers and Hammerstein version >w< My best friend and I are gonna se it.
Deadlypon3: just yes
I allowed him to see me due to him being someone I can trust, Neil.
Of course, Saxy is trustworthy as well.
http://denver.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw87_130050426794.jpg
Fluttershy looks cute in a black dress :$
Why is everyone attending the ball colour coordinated?
So much blue
In the real world, magic is just something we don't understand yet. In fiction magic is what ever the writer can get away with.
LadyCanary Whaaatever. You should have seen me as the king in my middle school thing :P
poniesarecoolyay: First, meet ScootaChicken. He is a bishie and jailbait. Also an alcoholic.
Heh, trust

FlutterMEDIC1: It doesn't stop hunting you just because you get onto dry land
IT would get to the point that they had to practice for hours before they actually had the chance to dance with others
the ladies look a bit dizzy from all that spinning
FASTER!
Fl00t4sh41: yes, but is Carrot Top wielding a ridculous weapon while a nuke is going off in the background? i though not

The only thing done right was the choreograpy

You did NOT just use the slap command.
Shizuka Insalted is just adding Sult to the wounds :P

/me slaps Reikim around a bit with a large trout

SuperBrony64: hi

Dashie_Dashie: "I have SPECIAL eyes."
that was... strange?
FableCharm: I'm afraid I have to spoil the endign for you. Cinderella gets the Prince
cachi01: cake? it doesnt look like cake, and the hole in its head too
The Big Lebowski is B?
LadyCanary Does he lover her?!
Prince, that is a bad pickup line and you should feel bad
cachi01: wait, it's a cake? double the chills
LadyCanary!
hai.
Hiya WallDives.
"As beautiful as meeee...."
Deadlypon3: I would say so yes.
:)
LadyCanary Is she imaging this?
I am unsure if the characters feel that way
Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Cypresswolf: accualy is dolan
Deadlypon3: yes, someone spiked the wine with LSD and they are both tripping bAlls
caught in a landslide etc
And they both wake up, disappointed and crying over a stack of magazines...
no escape from reality~

Really sonicdude558. REALLY.
Deadlypon3: the fatal flaw in this entire fairytale ... every time its wrong
The Secret of Kells is A… wuuuut?
That's why it's a FAIRY TALE.
So if all the stuff the fairy godmother gave her disapears at midnight, why doesn't that include the glass slipper she dropped?
/me slaps LadyCanary around with a large trout
It's plastic.
It's not real obviously. Stop taking it so seriously.

all you bronies are faggots
13they all have way too much dress

COMMON, like RATTATA!
because John Lennon is dead. That's why its hard to imagine.
Dull suprise
Rarity does not aprove common ponies
QBAlchemist: more like zubat lol
She's Brandy not Common. Common is male for god's sake.
WEAK LIke the PATHETIC Jeedddi Maaaster
/me hugs AJIsAwesome, thelonepony, and BladedWings

Papa is weak and miserable in HEAVEN
HI, Dark92Enigma-. :)
oh
my
god
Hi Dark92Enigma-
i just figured out
lawl
What, cachi01?
What?
has the same words
BladedWings: well you can make FEAR ratata .. but its still impractical :D
as wall
ehr
gerd
What'd I miss?
GIMME A PRIZE
how've you been Dark92Enigma-
Who?
Hi AJIsAwesome
QBAlchemist: whats FEAR ratata?
i wonder if they ever ran out of breath in this movie
Man, hope the prince got a prick of her blood at the ball so they can identify her
What?
Hi, J_E_Smith71. :)
when
Instead of a shoe that could fit anyone her foot size
/me gives cachi01 a prize ?
...well yes
BladedWings: its a lvl 1 rattata that kills ANYTHING ... but only works on one pokemon
Cause you made me like that
I actually did
Hi Dark92Enigma- :)
I wouldn't have gotten to the ball
Shaddup and end the confusion already.
QBAlchemist: wow...how does that even work?
wut
13yeah that's not a glass slipper
BladedWings: it abuses the pokemon moves and egg stuff
BRB
Search it on google.
13plexiglass at best
QBAlchemist: ah
Shizuka Best Plastic Slipper :p
She's from the dump :p
13to the dump to the dump to the dump dump dump
hi thelonepony!
13guinan get out of this movie
How can they make that argument when the whole idea was to pick a girl in one night?
13guard in the background is like "are they done singing yet"
Shizuka: 1.000.000 years DUNGEON for him/her
dat Whoopie singing....wow
13OOO
13HE WAS IN TITANIC
13just noticed
13i knew he looked familiar
which guy?
So the song had no purpose?
13well i'm muted so.. was that his father?
13next to whoopi?
Billy Zane?
13no not zane
13purple guy
wow this will be one nasty slipper
13he was mr andrews in titanic
Yeah, Shizuka :p
all the girls in the kingdom will have worn it...
red tie guy?
Isn't Rango too recent to be eligible?
13nice socks
Shizuka: Do you like Sound of Music and King and I? These songs were written by the same guys
It's too establish that the dude wants to find that girl...
...Yep...
13J_E_Smith71: haven't seen either
i like prizes
couldnt he just look at thier faces?
he got a pretty close look at the ball ...
13really seems like a glass slipper would be a pain to wear
Sure that's not a plastic slipper?
13can't flex at all
1000 women in the kingdom - and this slipper will fit only one, surely
Shows how rotten girls are in the fairy tale universe...they damn well KNOW they weren't the girl, but still will test their "luck" to practically screw over the prince...*golfclap* :P
lolnope
13BAH GAWD THE SLEEPER HOLD
ITS QUITe...Impossible
oh she had it for a second lol
And the slipper breaks
Oh jeez.
you'd think there'd be more than one person in the kingdom with that shoe size
whu doors?
too bad you aint getting any
that hobble
Conspicuous >_>
:(
eeyup, nothin behind this door <_<
Posting a retort three minutes late doesn't really work.
a door that goes... nowhere?
The law said Every <Maiden
4*
dat face XD
no wait
lols
3*
Shizuka, are you taking requests after the EMN?
deprderdpepdpeu0ud
chat derp?
nope
just slow
13no
You know this is one of the flaws of a multiracial Cinderella story...Cinderella was the one thin black woman. You have an easier time picking her out instead of checking every single women in the kingdom
13wrek will be drawing wub
08,01so i just watched today's episode
drawing wub?
Where is she going?!
08,01it was hilarious!
13oh good
CILLERENDA
08,01but i felt trixie's voice was a bit off
Shizuka: Oh hey, it's the carriage...wonder if one of the trumpet guys is gonna play Hawai 5-0
Enchiladda
Todays episode was my fav so far
ECHIDOONAAA
So many fanfic artists cried
08,01and she wasn't as funny when not speaking in the 3rd person
NOOOOO!
YEEESSSSSSSSSSSS
Noooooooo!
HAHA!
quiet woman
:D
dat darth vader
i am your god mother!
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooooooooooo
08,01also, stallionjack... meh, not as good as Big Mac
shut up woman!
Oh wait...
Good, you just scared the little girl
NOooooooooooooooooooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooooooo
IMPOSSIBRU
Shizuka: Have you seen it? Do you have the new ep queued up following EMN?
SCARING THE LITTLE GIRL!??
Iwa: Boooo
13no, yes
Gah, where did she come from?
08,01total fanservice episode
"WHO ARE YOU!?"
WAIT WHAT?!
08,01well, yeah
SO are they married now- WAHT?!
Dark92Enigma-: get ready :D
And then they made babies, THE END.
A lot of fanservice this episode.
...No they don't, nobody lovies me
Songg~ :)
Deadlypon3: Don't even question it... It's cillerenda
What I dont understand is why the prince had to have all the girls in the kingdom try on the slipper.
Did the godmother change dress in the middle of a song?
QBAlchemist: oh i will
05and that comment J_E_Smith71 would earn you a ban
05but i wont
Dark92Enigma-: i might be overbuilding your enthusiasm XD
LadyCanary|away: yea, how did someone not have the same size slipper XD
Fl00t4sh41: establishing shots. what's that?
soul yeah!
Watch the spoilers. 24-hr ban for those.
...
OKay, we get it, They are getting married
Not only that BladedWings
END ALREADY
QBAlchemist: right before my apathy toward my parents begin to grow :D
spoilers, there are ponies involved, and magic :)
eboiugh song end
QUIT DRAGGING IT MOVIE!
And the stepmother and sisters do not get their wish because there ugly and irriating
This one song wasn't from the original production. They took it from another R&H musical
I really can not wait for the back story on scootalo though.
MAN, i thought The Wiz hadn't this much singing
BAR THE GATES!
13but
What was the song count up to for this movie? I had to leave from Movie Night last night because of work.

13THE LION KING
13oh
And they lived happily ever after! - And what of the Evil Step Mother & Wicked Step Sisters? They starved to death because they had no idea how to do anything on their own, after forcing Cinderella to do all the work for so many years - The End!
Trollestia that's how you say it in the play :P
BladedWings: Well...Because she's black. So that would automatically knock out some of the girls.
Shizuka: It's the circle of.......Liiiiiiiife
5/10 it isn't aweful it's just forgetable
I thought it was awful
There was a serious lack of singing mice/10 >_>
BRANDY!
LadyCanary|away: ah true...did think of that for a sec lol
3/10 I really dislike the Cinderella Story
ITS AMAZING
How did this escape the WMC?

Water Mill Closet
/me just gets it and whaps QBAlchemist with a newspaper "bab QB, bad"
oh
Jageman: When a movie is banned from being played here forever
I have seen so many worse movies than this.
BladedWings: bab ?!? XZD
damn it XD
*bad
The ENIGMA'S review of Cinderella (1997): Surprinsingly enough, this movie was better than i thought. The costumes and sets were great--firmly placing this in the vaguely "old world" romantic place that fairy tales live--the pop stylings and characters of the actors instantly make this a period piece of the late 20th century--but that's just fine. Cinderella will be reborn many times in the coming generations. So sweet and va
BladedWings: there there
13so that happened
Dark92Enigma-: ... damn
Now for a better wedding story
o:
ITS pony time
otakon!
dat wedding :)
QBAlchemist: i gotta admit, i enjoyed it.....kinda

leap of faith
SHUP KIDS. ITS PONY TIEM

Shizuka: add more ralings?
13CHAAAARGE
TWILY!

>Holding spears with hooves.
why do they use spears?
twily :3
Pony logic.
i just realized when the we shared our hopes we shared our dreams part came up there were 3 alicorns as the guards
look at mah art http://oi45.tinypic.com/1hv9t.jpg
/me huggles AdamTheDuck :3
Shizuka: The force field holds out any creature not intended to pass it, so when they get repelled out, the guards can seize them immidiately...that's my headcanon, anyway
a thread has been amde against canterlot??
BOOM
13but
13if the train keeps going
Double bubble
Worgeral: i recon twi will become an alicorn eventualy

*evil
13again what are the guards going to do
cachi01: Why Nicolas Cage? :D
cachi01: :D
cachi01: look at ma art. ma art is amazing
AJIsAwesome: i was bored xd
Shizuka: PUT THEM AGAINST THE WALL!!!!!!!!!!!!
13THAT IS WRONG
I like to think that the shield is solid with parts that are simi-permeable.
13SHE WOULD BE THE MARE OF HONOR
Shizuka: Clean up the organ and other remains with their practical pointy garbage picking pins :)
so he forgot to tell her then?
Shining armor is now naked

and then Shizu didn't play part 2 :3
13they should have picked different music for the ending
Shizuka: hi
13i totally should
TO BE CONTINUED.
eeyup
oh.. my.. god D:
Shizuka: like......Hulk-like music?
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)﻿
Shizuka: ... that would be sooo evil
Shizuka: True, true
ye
Dark92Enigma-: Pixar Hell, that is where the evil version of Woody is.
I have to wonder, how much did ponies here freak out when that episode aired and everyone had to wait a week for the follow up?
two steps from hell music
Shizuka: the lonely man?
you will be *evil* ... happy theme
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)﻿ mentlegen
... shizu we are disapoint
Shizuka: dun dun dun dun duuuuuun
(O.O) @ Cinderella 3
/me kickx Trollestia
Dammit i missed it
13Mozdoc: they aired them both the same day
Mozdoc: They played them back to back
dat face
13not a very good two parter cliffhanger if you don't make people wait between parts
wipergone2: No! You are the beeeeeeeeyotch who likes bananas! I kick you to the MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
Ah, that kinda ruins the suspense...
EVIL
HIS EYES WENT ALL :P
13twilight, the moral of this story is your friends and princess are prone to being idiots, bring a camera everywhere
Shizuka: well there was also the ads which were a bit of a wait
MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONAAAAAA
/me goes to moon
Eeeeeeeeviiiiiiiiiil!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
AHAHHHHHHH
AHAHAHA
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)﻿
No, the moral of the story is bring evidence if you're calling people out.
totally should
BIG ADVENTURE!
13that too
I hate you all.
tons of fun
and magic make it all complete
13it is still intensely annoying that the moral is identical to lesson zero
FRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIENDS!
/me kills Trollestia
/me comes back to life, beeeeeeeeyotch
13we now rejoin twilight playing slender
Doesn't anyone wonder how Chrysalis got inside Canterlot during all this though? Might have gone something like this... https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-vkT9Qy6VP4c/ULpjpU6Qr7I/AAAAAAAANnw/P6fP9zcPV5M/s1600/bicyclequeenchrysalissketch.png
Shizuka: they should've put a commercial break, and make it a TV movie, like the pilot (that i picked by the way)
/me kills self
/me Revives Trollestia
poniesarecoolyay: you still here?
Twilight is playing Anmesia.
/me thanks JamesClydesdale
I thought the moral was magic solves everything.
echooo
SLENDEEEEEEEEEER
Amensia..
Eeeeyup.
Amnesia +1
yea!
13greedy explorers? lifting from myst now
Anmesia ... i hate that game
Kill boths wipergone2 and trollestia then destroy chat
isnt it nice?
it scared the SHIT out of me
Where Am I? - The Space BETWEEN Space!
help ... its the water temple from LoZ!
Amnesia = not scary
gamax92: but its awesome
yes it is.
13cadence, if you're going to be evil, at least try to kill twilight
no
Shizuka to be fair she had no proof and she had been acting overprotective since they heard about the wedding
i made nice friends like scootachicken and reikim
Shizuka: Don't ignore your friends.........trust your instincts......VERY SIMILAR
Power UP!
u want to be my friend too?
Charging missle!
cachi01: no se por que el esta aqui
no thx
13like every villain she spends more time taunting the hero than actually dealing with the hero
FIRE
thats an impressive weapon of murder
I am stupid :c

daww Cake Family on NMN :3 https://twentypercentcooler.net/post/show/27365/baked_goods-candy-costume-cupcake-earth_pony-equin

Shizuka: Evil!Cadence doesn'T EVEN try to kill Twi, she's like the IT of Ponies
Roll bluff
i think i made him mad
xD Shizuka xD
that turn was kinda weird
That Spy is not a Spy!
Shizuka: And that's why Sombra is actually the only villain who is actively trying to make a difference instead of taunting...even though he is terrible at it
Checks out >_>
maybe he wont want to be my friend anymore :(
ok she dont burn all is good
dabi didint hear you

Because I'd play MLP slender
hope ill be lying if i say
kirzstryfe: why nawt
Somewhere in the background is a creeper
im singing this now..
and herobrine
One of these days - when I have time - I'm going through each ep in a marathon and judge each song 1-however many there all now - this is still in my top 5
gamax92: that would be easy
soooooon
Dashie_Dashie: its too bright for creepers.
gamax92: just change the slenderman model for a slendemane model
MINE......ALL MINE
and there you go
13it's well composed but the only reason this won best pony song was because it had aired the week before voting
slende pony edition
finally the moment has arrived
MINE ALL MINE!
Shinning derp
Am I just the only one who doesn't love this song?
Derping Armor.
mine al mine hehehe
because LC felt like messing with all of you and I wasn't going to spoil it for him :p
Shining Derp
too easy? then make it 4096 pages.
Shizuka: not true, i voted for it because it was orchestral-ish and with good singing, and no simple pop beats
wow, celestia talks pretty loud lol
I still think it's best pony song, but I always like the villain songs.
tron sound effect
kirzstryfe: What was he doing?
0,5You knew all along, huh?
One of us! One of us!
>rape
Shizuka: the hype & anticipation for this ep was a major factor
On 4chan i found a very funny name for discord
BladedWings: the ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE!
Whilst I feel some form of respect for him, I want to kill him like always.
13eeyup
4096 pages should be hard, right?
wait
for a few hours
Dildocord
13BLUFF CHECK FAIL
BaconMane: wut
Dashie_Dashie: watch that word\
i..
stoppppp
ffffffffffffff
kirzstryfe: remembers your hostmask, thats not fair
i still think its the best song, hype or not
cachi01: ?
*GASP*:O
intimidate roll
Shizuka: same thing happened with the movie Avatar for best movie
13actually this is pretty simple
the cadence has been doubled.
QBAlchemist: she can also use it lol
Chrysalis really needs to work on her acting.
BaconMane trolled us hard
MINE!!!!!

13evil!cadence has rolled all the 20s out of her dice on the hide in plain sight checks

You never see them on acreen at the same time and she has eay access to Canterlot...
Shizuka: But then the actions of the Mane 6 wouldn't have mattered - Oh wiat...

HORY SHIT
Has the word alicorn actually been used before this episode?
King Sombra horcrux?
Its a requirement of magic shops. They have to have something "too powerful for mortal hands".
Nope.
XylemTube: "Shady" bingo, that's the secret word :)
it has a selection of toppings
Shizuka: because.....adults in ponyville are DUUUUUUUUUMB

Chekov's amulet :)
The elements of Harmonry and the Alicorn Charm.
Ryunosuke: I think so. I just can't place my finger on it.
thelonepony: IKR
So black market of illegal magic doohickeys is canon now
Why not? King Sombra needs to be expanded big time
13duplicate angels
Ryunosuke: Nope, that's why it's a big deal. Seriously, the fan made that term. It's like Derpy Hooves talking. A little. Kind of. A shout out to the fans.

13so question
FOREVER!
13why doesn't spike just send a letter to celestia
A LEVEL 100 TRIXIE
lol
AttackWithHugs: and apparently breath too
Why doesn't she cast that dark magic from earlier?
Defense: 0
Attack: 0
13saying trixie's shown up waaaay more powerful than she should be
Sp. Defense: 0
DAT FLUTTERSHY FACE
BladedWings: if i'm related to Dorian Gray, and if i know who he is
HAX
Sp. Attack: ITS OVER NINE THOUSAAAAAAAAAAAND
O-o
But is she the highest lever Freemason?
Shizuka: because that would make the episode short.
No mouth, no nose
Dark92Enigma^: ah
I call HAX
Speed: 15.
BladedWings: basically, trolling
ANNNNND THE DERPY EYES
Shizuka: Because she's Saddle Arabia
cause spike is dumb :I
Shizuka: I'm guessing the force field blocks the letter transmission?
simposons movie all over again
Shizuka: She was in Sandle Arabia
13but
D'aaaaaaaaawwww
13magic mail
DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOME
BioDome!
I like to think that shield stops Spike's messages getting out.
13it should just find her
Pinkie is the apnea champion
Has to eat through an IV in the arm/hoof :<
chat glitch
dindong sounds >_<
wait, so now nobody can get out of ponyville?
/me turn out to of cloned himself to trick Trollestia
Tovler: no, I AM
Don't go twilight!
13UUUUUUSE THE FOOOORCE TWILIGHT

Applebloom will turn you into a blank!!
*turns
You'll become blanked Twilight!
/me is actually the real Blaze666
Shizuka: GO TO THE DAGOBAH SYSTEM
13OH NOW YOU THINK OF MESSAGING CELESTIA
I would say the sheld would block the letter
13okay so
Annddd Zecora
13why not message luna?
LUNA
Shizuka: lol
Oh god, please don't say Dagobah System
cause luna is useless
If she'd use dark magic, aging would be a snap
Shizuka: BECAUSE she's on the moon occassionally
maybe magic mail doesn't go through magic dom?
13that way celestia shows up going "did i miss anything"
Orr... Zecora.
Take her on MOUTH to MOUTH.
AttackWithHugs: hard to believe that the ending makes up for all of this
AttackWithHugs: Dagobah System :)
Saberavia
I love Zecora in the episode.
so zebras are naturaly magical?
DinkyDoo: ;)
Shizuka: Can Spike send to other ponies?
Agreed, GilDash.
Its like an Earth pony using magic.
if shes banished from ponyville, why can't she go to canterlot
Rocky montage time?
so thats why those ponies was wearing that get up
Gonna fly noooow
Mmmhm
GODDAMNIT TWILIGHT
I just saw Baby Cakes.
hmm
Of course, Zecora showed up in Bridle Gossip, and that was one of my favourite episodes.
AttackWithHugs: except mute Pinkie that is. She still has to earn that back.
Pumpkin Cake..
Caged Mayor:D
intersting
/me gets Twilight to send Trollestia into the sun
interesting*
MadSurge: I know. I was like "Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa?"
gamax92, it's a long way to canterlot
We need to see other Zebras, I mean we saw 2 Griffins
Aw, Pinkie. :<
she does evil dances ...
Now I debate whether or not to use a nick that's more familiar or not.
that's why they always go there by train
THIS IS WHINING
Why no gore?
I still want to see more griffons...
/me tickles ayejay :3
but she can teleport
Needs more blood.
And then Zecora became Yoda! Use the Force, Twilight
13now she's a waterbender
water bending
empty your mind ...
Oh hey star wars
Shizuka: things have changed since Twilight Sparkle left Ponyville.......or should i say. TRIXIEPOLIS
Twilight is Jesus
/me is actually Blaze666 so Blaze666 is sent to the sun and Trollestia is left in Equestria to rule the world
Twilight is best water bender
"no one makes it on the first try"
WATER BENDING
13twilight, jesus you aren't
AttackWithHugs: but making her apologetic without destroying her character... it works! :O
Shizuka: the last of their kind?
"Do or do not! There is no try."
UNLEARN WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNED YODA REFERENCE
She fell into the Atlantic ocean.
JEBUS TWILIUS
Everybody falls the first time.
Yoda Zecora has become
LadyCanary: yes
PresidentGanjalf: THAT IS WHY YOU FAIL
PresidentGanjalf: i was going to say that
TWILIGHT! I have an idea!
Use the force, Run to degobah, run to degobah
13so
13trixie wandered into town
DinkyDoo: STATE IT
why not go to luna for help

Show Trixie Cupcakes! Or better yet, make her read the fic! She will give up!
13and said WOLOLO
WOLOLOL
DinkyDoo: Twiiiiiiiiliiiiiiight i have an ideeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
/me uses his last second to get twilight to use her failsafe spel
But...think of the fanfic authors! Those poor souls.

...wat?
Snails, learn to stage whisper
And now Snips n Snails are her whipping boys again
I don't get "I don't trust wheels"

She doesn't trust them.
Trixie doesn't believe in wheels

Trollestia: you can go backstage and grab any props you need
gamax92: i.....JUST DONT' know what to say about the awesomeness of MLP:FIM referencing the Simpsons
not sure
MadSurge: I'm guessing it was a joke explanation for why she's not using them.
so much for being modest
WHY IS IT SO MEAN<1?
13well fraud is higher on the scale of good than evil
why not just dig underground?
Sheds are more trustworthy
:D I love Snail's line
^^^ Guy above me is totally right. Completely right. Definitely and absolutely right.
She was tree
Those are a couple of REALLY strong 8 year olds.
Splintershy
Was there something from the first Trixie episode about here not trusting wheels?
AJIsAwesome: that makes sense
Now we instead of Fluttertree we have Flutterlog
Dark92Enigma^, those two references
Wait, wasn't she wandering with a cravan before. You know, a caravan with WHEELS?
Trollestia: pinkie pie reaches behild the invisible curtain and gets stuff.
Also Fluttershy is a tree again
13why not just get the birds to do it
Jageman: BALL EMERGENCY
Is Fluttershy wearing socks?
Everfree forest = BLANKED APPLEBLOOM
SKy Running is best running
Teddy bear
Yes
twilight doen't speak bird
Shizuka: they're busy with the bees
teddy bear? the one she broke the neck of?
TEDDY BEAR SHIPPING, GO
pinkie could just teleport over the wall.
Dat wiggling :D
Harry Bear

But of course!
WRONG!
Elements of harmony again?
Zecora still speaks in riddles
<Eli> admin trolls are even worse...
Shizuka: Chemical Warfare? Aw yeah...
/me trolls Eli
:p
at first when she said that i thought they were gonna use the element of harmony
YOU!
Shizuka: You know it
MOi?
Jealous?
YOUUUUUUUU.
I!
JEWWW
I saw one part of the twist coming... not the better one though :$
Yes, youuuuuu bitch
MakerDusk: meh... have fun
MUAA

Was the the grenade click sound i heard?
so we have star wars and the empire strikes back. when is return of the jedi?
The Amulet is Trixie using a Gameshark to hack her way to Level 100
twilight_sprinkle, boooooo
it was THE PYRAMID OF LIGHT THAT GAVE TRIXIE POWER
SPOILER: TRIXIE IS EVIL
thats not how amulets work XD

DAT LYRA!! DAT LYRAAAAAA!!!!!!!
Shizuka: no, there are many more
Lets!
*part
TIME FOR FUCKERY
.....Apparently so, Shizu
Shizuka: you forgot fire, water, air, earth, and heart
this needs to be a yugioh card battle
Shizuka, I wouldn't put jealousy in there. The elements seem to be some kind of purity
THE WHEEL OF FATE IS TURNING! Rebel 2! Action!
OMG
SO ADORABLE
Starlight_Phoenix: YOU ACTIVATED MY TRAP CARD!!
#showoff
LadyCanary: Blazeblue?
Yes
MadSurge, yes that :3 Silly
Just keep them that way
Is mayo an element?
LadyCanary: Yeeees!
WUT.
gamax92: AND AN INSTRUMENT
No gamax92, mayo is not an element.
double rainbow
GGGGGODLIKE
13oi twilight, didn't you learn anything from too many pinkies
dat lyra
Horseradish is not an element, either
ohai Lyra and Bonbon
THE RAINBOW DASHES HAVE BEEN DOUBLED
DOUBLE RAINBOW ALL THE WAY
Dat Lyra
WHATT DOES IT MEAN?:O
aww
gamax92: No, gamax, mayonaise is not an instrument.
Trollestia: well you activitaed my trap card: solemn judgment
The Rainbow has been doubled
Lyra LOVES hay shakes.
NOW TAKE THEM TO THE POND
ohai guys

13RULE 63 IS CANON
LAdyCanary you get all my internets for that reference.
Lyra does not give a fuck
Hi, RDash5000. :)

Eli: there is so much I could do XD
Starlight_Phoenix: FUUUUUUUUUCK

lol
AND MAKE THEM WATCH PAINT DRY?

HOLY SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT

?
great episode
Manjack
:)
HEY WHAT THE FUCK TRIXIE
MakerDusk: and there are soo little fucks to give from me
I don't understand, how can this be? Open your eyes, maybe you'll see.
There's going to be a lot of stallion arts of the main six now...
What are you talking about, MakerDusk?
Eyup, in Equestria sex changes are done with magic instead of surgery.
Mozdoc: Slooooooooow poke.
Trixie is dumb, stupid dumb.
Trixie should just have worn both.
Powerfiler
Dat evil laugh
MakerDusk: if it makes you happy, go on. troll.
Dat stallion AJ :D
Tovler: no rhyming
NOW I'LL WEAR BOTH AMULETS!!
why not have both on?
Mozdoc: there already is
I don't even know, AJIsAwesome
Eddmario: What did you expect?
MakerDusk: ???
she has both TRIFORCES
I'm busy trolling the gnaa
*cough* more powerful
well PS2 just got all done downloading
lol
so I'm a tad on overdrive right now XD
Aw.
13and now it's crumbs
Agony? Jesus, Trixie...
agony
>_>
MakerDusk: ah that's probably even honorable
you owe the zebra a new trinket
/me pecks at the crumbs.
lol
WHAAAAAAAAT
DOORSTOP??
Rarity Belle is best pony
may the Trolling be with you, always
A little bit of cleverness.
[]DeadpoolDash: hope your computer can handle it
13the magic of HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAX
lol
The magic of bullshit
Zecora's doorstops are imba
HAAAAAAAAAAAACX
HOW DID THEY CHANGE THEIR EYES??????
im confused
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAX
PERFECT TROLLING
The magic of somke and mirrors
ofcoursE!
Trollestia, Rarity's magic contact lense of course
It's Pinkie Pie. Don't question it.
Noo, that was the magic of cheating!
Shizuka: Truer words were never spoken
Friendship!
now kiss
:D
Yay!
Horses
Big Mac. The first pony CANON CROSSDRESSER. Okay, even for the HUB that's walking a line.
awww
wth
:(
13and then a spike x fluttershy ship was launched
This episode just stopped making sense.
I like those Saddle Arabia horses.
CrystalPhoenix: HAAAAAAAAX
I think Pinkie Pie is the essence of magic
/me throws a computer monitor at Twilight
I like this. Twilight beat Trixie by outwitting her instead of using some one shot magic charm power up thingie
Yes
Agreed, RawketLawnchair.
YES YES YES
13we just need trixie to interact with a pony named bob
Starlight_Phoenix: WRONG, SHE IS THE ESSENCE OF THE UNIVERSE
Who are those 2?
Too bad we never actually heard the delegates from Saddle Arabia speak...
don't forgive it
no no no no no no no trixie cannot be nice
very out of character :/
CrystalPhoenix: But they change everything BUT their eyes
James from Team Rocket crossdressed and nobody even noticed
daaaaaw look at dat faaace :(
More importantly, this puts a cap on Twi's powers.
GODDAMNIT TRIXIE
now kiss trixie twilight
Great and Apologetic :D
not really
this is fake
NO
:D
This is rushed, but I thinks it works
lol
she Does sound a bit off
derp
XD
Now trixie is friendship.
faceplant
no
okay thanks
Trip
Dat trip
ouch
diddutz, rarity has a lot of different contact lenses
Tovler: James was insanely good at it, though.
And pratfall
trip
FACEPLANT
...
AND BEST ENDING LD
BEST PART EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
:D:D:D:D
What 4th wall?
this time pinkie and twilight breaks the 4th wall
:D
fail:D
nope
I love that ending
:D
:D Pinkie Pie! *Inhales* The End! :D Best Ending!
4th Wall breach! WARNING!
HORY SHIT PINKIE
WHAAAAAAAT
Welp, Twilight knows about the 4th wall now.
:D
And that's how this episode was ruined :D
Backstage
lol Pinkie :D
I liked the ending, never saw trixie as an evil character
Aweome ep/10
Woo
!cd
Episode 6 of season 3 "Sleepless in Ponyville" airs in 6 days, 13 hours, 49 minutes, 15 seconds (Dec 08 15:30:00 2012 UTC)
THAT FOURTH WALL IS GOOOOOOOONE
that ending reminded me of a show,,,
And Pinkie Pie Says Goodnight is now canon
Best episode ever so far
hmm
also, twilight can also break 4th wall now
but the pink dummy ranger didnt get a chance to finnish her intro again!
what 4th wall?
cant remeber
Loved this episode 10/10
10/10
this gets me curious
desertman2: Well, of s3 anyway...
20/10
DocSane: That's all folks!
o/ Shizuka
remember*
What'd you think Shizuka?
trixie tripped/10
they did not break the forth wall, they just went backstage
was an awesome ep, true
So, can someone tell me what the hell all that painting of ponies was about?
OK.....THAT WAS MORE OVER THE TOP than i thought.......but I LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
fireplace!
thanks Shizuka
Thanks for the stream, Shizuka. :)
Shizuka: Thanks for stepping in. ^_^
tnx for stream Shizuka
BTW: Took over the Ponyville and established a dictatorship. Let her go.
Because I have no clue what that was about.
Thanks for the stream, Shizuka
If Trixie's corruption was more distinct, it would have been better. Possessed by horcrux Sombra would have made it 10/10
Thankies for stream Shizuka
Thanks for streaming Shizuka :)
good stream shizuka
Thanks for the stream, Shizuka :)
Thanks for the amazing stream Shizuka ^_^
gamax92: They painted Granny Smith, Apple Bloom, and Big Mac as AJ doubles.
Shizuka, also extra thanks for stepping in for Euro BMN
gamax92: she repainted the CMC to look like filyl rarity/aj and repainted big mac to look like male applejack
Still... Big Macintosh, Equestria's first canon crossdresser. Which is really impressive when you realise that they DON'T WEAR CLOTHES.
gamax92: Twilight couldn't preform age spells and the like, so she used her friends to fool Trixie into thinking she could with that amulet, making her take hers off.
good stream
i'm still a bit suprise of what happen today
gamax92: And painted Sweetie Belee to look like Rarity.
Thankyou Shizuka :)
oh i get it.
that would be like sombra would be a villain throughout the enitre season
Shizuka: Thanks for the stream, now what do you think of the Pilot, the Wedding Episode and Today's one?
?
Kencolt: HAHAHA
wtf
What happened, thelonepony?
about LC
13that sequence with the fake amulet will take some freeze framing
Shizuka: you made my day better! (hugs you)
i meant
fluttershy is still a bitch.
13i'm sure the eye colors all show a la rarity in sisterhooves
thank you very much for the stream Shizuka:)
Sombra is so undeveloped as a charachter.
BaconMane|AFK is best troll :D
wat ees thes?
So all the apples were painted like AJ except AJ
Video game sequence?
Ah.
actually no, she became a genuine one in this ep
its just like, "This is bad guy, he does bad things."
Kencolt no wait Twilight cross dressed for nightmare night
Brother_Aura: Shizu's outro
thanks Shizuka
What did you expect Tovler
he was fucking around with our minds and stuff :D
r63 spells now canon
Pretty long.
13still means r63 is canon
portal!
For some reason, girls cross-dressing is okay.
"alicorn" is also a canon word now
trolling is pointless and stupid. no matter who does it
Adventure Time's r63 is better
AlienWarhead: Well, technically, but no-onje was meant to be fooled. Heck, no-one-- or almost no-one knew what it was.
no
alicorn wasn't canon?
AlienWarhead: Hallow-i mean Nightmare Night doesn't count
/me claps
Shizuka: I dunno. Age spells, sure. R63 spells, not so much.
AJIsAwesome: but more incredible, Meanwhile DIDN'T hate the episode!
gamax92: nope
do rozen maiden.
thx for streaming
I like rozen maiden.
13nope
MadSurge: and with taht, i want to ship him with Triwie
MadSurge: :O impossible :P
13wrek time
or dreaming.
I know, right? :D
my entire life was a lie.
trixie*
Thanks Shizuka! It was awesome!!
Lauren Faust originally was quoted with using "Unicorn", but once "Alicorn" caught on in the fandom, the show crew just went with that.
Thanks for staying stable, Cox Cable
13my series will be tomorrow or later tonight maybe
Now give us an episode where Rarity and AJ really get turned to kids and Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle learn about the responsibilities of being a good older sister.
With that outro?
It scares me.
night BronyState
Hey Wrek. Ready for a great stream :D
nite AlienWarhead
bye AlienWarhead
Thanks for stepping up Shizuka
Night, AlienWarhead. :)
:$
051 sec then!
welp gonna do some "stuff" atm <_<
Hell, I don't hate Trixie anymore! And she was the worst pony!
i just love the element of kindness threatened to hurt her friend in that ep
Wait...
Wrek?
Yay ~
So Shizuka what's your verdict on the new ep?
Wait. Does Big Mac make a hu7nky Appejack, or does Applejack make a cute Big Mac? That just hit me.
DocSane: Thats actualy a preety dope idea
I fear no mod.
twilight_sprinkle: that was funny and a little scary lol
13was good, felt short
But that... THING...
It scares me...
yeah it was a lot to fit in 20 mins
cratorkid: I picture young Rarity as having a totally different personality from adult Rarity.
13they probably could have easily made that a two parter
Kencolt: i think its the first one
that couldve been a two pa-
cratorkid: Since Rarity's personality was entirely invented by herself.
DocSane: That's kind of a given. "STUPID ROCK!"
Shizuka: Where'd be the fun in that?
what happened to that ponies person
13they could spend half of one ep building up "someone's terrorizing the town"
13reveal it to be trixie
Wait how do all these ships get started? I'm lost.
13ep ends with twilight being banished
So, it'd be funny seeing Sweetie dealing with a bratty Rarity who's totally un-ladylike.
Desu... Is a sin, in his presence...
13next ep starts with twi going to zecora, spend more time on the training arc
DocSane: nods* now that im thinking, they will still be blank flanks
13then come back and win
Well, at least "On a Cross and an Arrow" has a semi-canon character model for IT'S Applejack. :P
Maybe Twilight could meet up with Timon and Pumbaa
hm i would the reveal would have to happen within 10 mins, and the rest would be the new regime of ponyville and training of twi
I have no idea.
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_med1ggnyyT1rc2ye5o1_1280.jpg
13but given the characterization failure of sombra
*would think
13feel like the writers this season are getting complacent
Shizuka: Make the first duel a bit more epic
Shizuka: Could it be aranged that instead of two episodes? it would be a 44minute episode?
Wrek stream is up ^_^
what did people think of cinderella dance scene?
they turmed out to be BaconMane|AFK trolling everyone Buytoast
They certainly neeed more time with their episodes... but that said, the Royal Wedding was handled really, really well, and that was both parts.
ah
Wrek sessions... With a google chrome theme!
It is the bane of my existance...
thanks for stream shizu :>
cratorkid: You could even make the episode grow out of this one, with Twilight being inspired to try a real age spell and then not being able to reverse it immediately.
13the problem is the royal wedding was completely ignoring the moral of Lesson Zero
I think Sombre was supposed to be a Sauron like villain
Wreky stream <3
13<3
royal wedding felt more like pew pew than morals
I must be miss informed, whats Wrek's stream
i still liked it tho ofc
DocSane: i was thinkig the same, then maybe on of them doesnt want to change back?
given a bit more solid writing, he could have been
LadyCanary What is happy about this, THING?
B-b-but Shizuka, there was a differnt Princess involved!
Twilight was too eager to confront Cadence. She should have talked privately first.
What thing, Brother_Aura
A-a-and a wedding!
cratorkid: You could do that, too.
I can's say it out loud..
13it was a duplicate of Lesson Zero with the stakes turned up for them failing to listen to twi
I will be banned for 12 seconds!
we found derpy ^_^ http://cheezburger.com/6830343168
Sombra wasn't entirely... there. Unlike Nightmare Moon or Discord, or even Chrysalis, he was less a villain with a mind, and almost a memory-- as they said, a shadow.
*can't
That "thing" happens to be my special somepony Brother_Aura

cratorkid: I'd say it'd likely be Rarity, since she's so much older than her sister, she might enjoy being able to grow up with her.
cratorkid: And then it'd end with her realizing she already grew up once before and had a life and career.

BaconMane|AFK: I missed your trolling :(
wtf did i just see
They didn't have cutiemarks though.

YES THIS VID

I just learned that the moon comes in the night!
13awwwwwwww
Brony_ponies: you can see it during the day too sometimes
Engi x Turret
Tovler: There's not as much need for weather control or magic in Saddle Araiba, which is why they look like more normal horses, rather than the short pones of Equestira.
Sooo, what now? Another stream incoming?
It's... like like a loyal puppy that isn't lethal but help with it.

Twilight Or Trixie?
ALLONS-Y
I printed out how to draw reference sheets
PrincessLollipopGear: It's Wrek that's drawing. :)
Who is better,twilight or trixie?
Doctor-Whooves What ever floats your boat. If you can, give hima broken crown for a cutie mark, please.
Wrek doesnt do dubstep, the only thing remotely close to that is Swedish House Mafia
AJIsAwesome, oh sorry XD
Nah, it's cool. :D
Also I can't draw worth crap.

Anime_Brony: both are awesome and my favs, but must go with twi

All the kids are actually dead
WELL A TRUCK TIRE IS SMARTER THAN U CURLY HIAR
Reikim, stop sounding like a canadian. We already have enough in the USA
it's a terrible theory
AJIsAwesome: For people under 14 where they can learn the ways of bronystate until there 14 XD
you're terrible for enjoying it
:D
eeyup
I AM a Canadian. Deal with it, bitch.

And it makes sense
It sucks, but it does
Makes me sad actually

DEATH TO THE JANITOR
Ponies47: Nah, that's Bronystate kindergarten. :3
Janitors are actually nice people
Your theory is bad and you should feel bad!
