Cinder-Ella
I was going to go into Networking Technologies. Programming and Logic was one of the requirements.
this movie involves racism
cider ella
Thinking it was reletively simple, I idiotically went into it xD

HEY! It's Costanza!
Finshed my picture http://i.imgur.com/3zoAd.png ^_^

Such grace.
You can be a regular if you manage to hang around daily for a month.

13they're evil
Well, at least she cares for the animals.
not sure
13well fraud is higher on the scale of good than evil
why not just dig underground?
Those are a couple of REALLY strong 8 year olds.
Splintershy
Was there something from the first Trixie episode about here not trusting wheels?
Wait, wasn't she wandering with a cravan before. You know, a caravan with WHEELS?
13why not just get the birds to do it
Is Fluttershy wearing socks?
SKy Running is best running
Yes
pinkie could just teleport over the wall.
Dat wiggling :D
13use the sicks
13invade a hospital
USE THE 6?
Use the Sics

The magic of somke and mirrors
ofcoursE!
Noo, that was the magic of cheating!
now kiss
:D
Horses
awww
wth
:(
This episode just stopped making sense.
I like those Saddle Arabia horses.
I think Pinkie Pie is the essence of magic
/me throws a computer monitor at Twilight
I like this. Twilight beat Trixie by outwitting her instead of using some one shot magic charm power up thingie
Yes
YES YES YES
Too bad we never actually heard the delegates from Saddle Arabia speak...
don't forgive it
no no no no no no no trixie cannot be nice
very out of character :/
daaaaaw look at dat faaace :(
More importantly, this puts a cap on Twi's powers.
GODDAMNIT TRIXIE
now kiss trixie twilight
Great and Apologetic :D
not really
NO
:D
This is rushed, but I thinks it works

this time pinkie and twilight breaks the 4th wall
:D
fail:D
:D
4th Wall breach! WARNING!
HORY SHIT PINKIE
WHAAAAAAAT
Welp, Twilight knows about the 4th wall now.
:D
And that's how this episode was ruined :D
Backstage
lol Pinkie :D
Aweome ep/10
Woo
!cd
THAT FOURTH WALL IS GOOOOOOOONE
And Pinkie Pie Says Goodnight is now canon
hmm
also, twilight can also break 4th wall now
cant remeber
Loved this episode 10/10
10/10
20/10
remember*
trixie tripped/10
they did not break the forth wall, they just went backstage
OK.....THAT WAS MORE OVER THE TOP than i thought.......but I LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
fireplace!
good stream
oh i get it.
?
wtf
about LC
i meant
fluttershy is still a bitch.
thank you very much for the stream Shizuka:)
wat ees thes?
actually no, she became a genuine one in this ep
r63 spells now canon
Pretty long.
13still means r63 is canon
For some reason, girls cross-dressing is okay.
"alicorn" is also a canon word now
no
alicorn wasn't canon?
/me claps
do rozen maiden.
thx for streaming
I like rozen maiden.
13nope
13wrek time
or dreaming.
I know, right? :D
trixie*
Thanks for staying stable, Cox Cable
With that outro?
It scares me.
:$
051 sec then!
welp gonna do some "stuff" atm <_<
Wait...
I fear no mod.
But that... THING...
It scares me...
yeah it was a lot to fit in 20 mins
13they probably could have easily made that a two parter
that couldve been a two pa-
13they could spend half of one ep building up "someone's terrorizing the town"
13reveal it to be trixie
13ep ends with twilight being banished
13then come back and win
Well, at least "On a Cross and an Arrow" has a semi-canon character model for IT'S Applejack. :P
I have no idea.
