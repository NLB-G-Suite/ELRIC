I should start putting it as the A movie I guess.
chatting on a saturday
welcome back Dark92Enigma :)
Oh a Pony/Brony Joined ^,.....,^
Seems like an A.
Barbetos, yes
Barbetos, so much yes
My next A-movie choice.
Same here
Gona just jot that down.
Pencil it in.
And just btw, Just Cuase 2 is too fun for its own good.
It really is quite fun.
I should of Bought that game when i had the chance ;_:
I never seen that movie, Is it good?
It is the best.
The absolute best.
Ah
is it both good and bad what movie writers are doing to classic fairy tales?
thelonecubone|GoW3, you have a Steam account?
well, I hope it gets pick Next lotto
No
;_;
Kammerjunk: THIS IS GONNA BE GOOD
and even if i had one, My computer needs some stuff to be able to play games
Like ram
I just had the worst idea ever. Try calling Shizu shizuki.
and some other stuff
>if looks could kill
Dayum Phase4, did you just wake up? XD
I mean, right?
Because -everbody- knows Abe Lincoln is a badass.
I watched the Asylum ripoff of Abe Lincoln Vamp Hunter. It was so bad.
And not bad funny. Just bad.
so ded
Haha. If looks could kill indeed.
you guys don't even know
00,02AdamTheDuck, yeah, my sleeping patern is non existant
Phase4: You should try the Uberman cycle.
damn friendly fire and that torcho Bow ;_;
I think a bagel and some coffee will bring me back to life.
Phase4: It's absolutely terrible if you miss a nap.
00,02Kammerjunk, the what now?
Hai Phase4, nice colors
If I had a video game, a coffee cup would be my extra life icon.
IF I where a video game I should say.
DerpyMuffins, now you've ruined it :P
Phase4: The Uberman cycle. 20-30 minute naps every 4 hours.
I wanna PS2...
If you miss one nap, you'll hate everything.
Kammerjunk, it takes me 30 minutes to stop my mind yelling ideas at itself
Phase4, I would suggest a glass of warm milk
On the bright side, it was the most lucid dreams I've ever had.
Phase4: Oh. Well, that'd be a problem.
Try meditation. Or hell, try archery. It's so relaxing, you don't even.
Take a shot of espresso Phase4, it should help
btw, i've seen RainBroDash was back earlier this morning
If the crash doesn't get you, I would suggest some anti-depressions
Phase4 It yells? Geez. You should tone that mankey down.
13phase you seem like you get how to make easy wool, i needs help ><
Dark92Enigma: We saw him like 3 nights ago
Make wool?
Am I missing some slang?
minecraft
Get a sheep farm Shizuka
Shizuka, ?
thelonecubone|GoW3: what's his signature mod color?
Oh.
13i'm no good fencing up sheep and such
Phase4 that does not build confidence.
Sheep farm? o.O
Dark92Enigma: I cant remember >.< but he did kick LC without signing in
Yeah. One of the best farms I ever saw involved minecarts and an open pasture.
0,5>>
Shizuka, direwolf pack?
13ja
13minus portal plus logistics, same as before
The mods have spoken!!
Sacrifice the sheep!
13warehouse is done, afaik all the ores that can be doubled are being doubled
13we won't be for want of rubber
Well, it's no fun if you're only sacrificing sheep.
I used to play black and white.
Ohai BaconMane
Besides, Friday is the best day for sacrificing. So much fresh meat.
Phase4: minecra---oh, i was too late
Evil all the way. Sacrificing children like it was going out of style.
Barbetos: Black & White the God game?
Man, I loved that.
Oh yes
That game was really genius
It was just hard to understand
aparently my computer lost the modpacks
Shame Lionhead seems too focused on Fable now.
gimi sec to download
And keeping your pet sane was a chore in itself. you could go from teaching it not to throw poo, punish it, and it some how learns to not poo ever.
Oh god, I know.
Thats also my review for that game.
XD
I eventually gave up and went evil. Let the bugger do whatever it wanted to.
Being evil also gave me a lot of mana.
Yeah. Bring it out to get converts every now and then. I always seemed to have an issue with my creatures wanting to be good, even though I was evil
Eh. Worked wonders for coverting new villages
I am sure the whip lash experience was not lost to said villagers.
Well, being an evil God, I had my Creature on the Soldier role half the time, anyway.
I'm talking about the second game, by the way.
Wasn't that the sequal?
I never played it.
I played the first one.
Oh. What a shame.
Yeah, I played the first one, but I've been having trouble finding a proper version again.
uh....
When Pokemon Black and White came out I was so confused when people talked about it. I immediately always thought about the Loinhead games
13i think FTB screwed up their launcher
I still get confused from time to other. I keep just assuming they were talking about the Lionhead game and just talked about it as if they'd know.
looks like
Let to a lot of confusion.
13the Direwolf20 line is actually voxelbox
i clearly see computercraft in the mod lists
Thats a game I should sink time into. Minecraft. has so many mods now I should really revisit it.
I only played survival maps when it was in alpha/beta
Didn't do much productive.
Phase4 I hope you're running the same versions Shizu is running
it's the same version
just missing mod packs
ohai Lyra`
Ohai Lyra`
oh hey babe
Ohai Lyra`
Long time no see Lyra`
Well Discrod by LivingTombstone won the #1 spot of top 100 2012 in everfree network
Ohi all
I am not surprised as well as disapointed
Ohai Vectasus
ive been at places :3
Hello Vectasus
falso
my cheeks are burning
and my body feels cuddly
Alcohol again Lyra`?
who wants a hug?
sudden kersplosion. that is all.
/me nuzzle nuzzle snuggle huggle
Are you drunk again?
Key word again
when am i not?
also, there are 169 people in her <3
*here
lol 169
Shizuka, all the mods are clearly there, same as the client i was using last time
ikr! Tie
i've no idea why it wont work
Ooh free hugs? :$
13hm
I'll take a hug Lyra`
13can MultiMC export an instance?
free hugs? I like hugs ^_^
no idea what multimc is
Shizuka is my second favorite mod, because SuperBrony64 is my most favorite one, but i like shizuka because shes a strong independant black woman who dont need NO man
13better minecraft launcher, can maintain multiple instances with different mods or different minecraft versions
Yup, she's drunk again
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Animaniacs Coming to The Hub!
Yup, Lyra`. It's fun until 469. Then you get this awkward square of flesh.
Lyra` hey that is my line. =|
meow
Barbetos, i am a strong independant black woman who dont need you, because you be a man
Its kay though you can use it XD
they're just now talking about the Hub getting Animaniacs?
how goddamn slow can Sir Dragongroper be?
did anyone else hear that G4 the television channel is shutting down?
Cactus. that is all.
hub's getting anmaniacs?
neat
Lyra`, GOOD
and dat makes me sad
That channel was shit
It was alright
what CrystalPhoenix said
CrystalPhoenix, go buck a duck
I'm so conflicted
i liked G4
It just made me kind of board though.
Lyra`, I heard.
Lyra`, D:
Lyra`, Tech.tv was perfect as it was
I never got to see its good stuff aparently.
I liked G4
I don't want to be bucked ;~;
G4 deserves to be shut down. They were really not that good at catering to their audience, and then sorta gave up on catering to their audience entirely.
G4 came in and ate Tech.TV
oh AdamTheDuck <3
G4 was fun while it lasted
Now it's ded
sadface of doom
Their target audience could not be bothered to watch tv in the first place
What happened to Icon, Cinematech, the OLD X-Play
so there lies the problem right?
i liked attack of the show
YUS^
attack of the show was horrible
and friday was their last episode.
13Phase4: 192MB, want me to just zip and send?
well then CrystalPhoenix, there is no pleasing you.
Shizuka, might as well
Lyra`, not from G4
Exactly. GTFO
and you are an unpleasable mess, who will grow old lonely
far as i can tell everythings correct here
so mew mew mew mew mew, and buck you too
You're awfully quick to make such assumption
shush, ive forgive you and i love you dearly
INTERNET FIGHT!!!
now hug me.
I'm not a fan of E-hugs
awww. it was getting good
Hugs are two fiddy around here now
then pay up.
0,5No U
Broke.
I spent all my money on hugs
No money here.
/me e-hugs CrystalPhoenix :P
I am hopelessly addicted.
Wrong chat BaconMane?
BaconMane, i demand you talk to me in a private chat.
0,5>.>.....
Lyra is better as a music student and not an anthropology addict
OH SNAP
you dont even know me, CrystalPhoenix
Anthropology was good though
Lyra`, I said the character
^
I know you're drunk Lyra`
the song was good
Its what got me to read anything lyra related
champagn
but Lyra is better as a music student than an anthropology addict still
I mean that is how I started to read Background Pony
Shizuka, i figured out what happened >_<
Background Pony is BOSS
13uh oh what
Shizuka, there was an update, all my mods are slightly the wrong version
Background Pony is amazing
13yeah thought so
13server doesn't know how to update FTB pack anyway so that's kind of a dumb thing for them to do
Told ya to check the versions Phase4
meyow
and I do admit I don't enjoy some of the ridiculousness fanon that the community makes out
uh oh... sexual meows.
my mom is baking cookies and I just got back from yelling at my video game.
like associating Vinyl with dubstep
Why is Lyra into humans in the first place?
13actually it weighs 180MB... but should be faster coming from mediafire
stupid internet :|
I never understood that
can't she just be a normal DJ that has a very vast selection of music?
Disk Jockey
hey bronies did you ever yell at a video game?
DerpyMuffins, she was seen sitting "like a human"
kidzrul732, I did many times
kidzrul732: all...the...time lol
So?
All ponies sit like that
It's been made canon
^^^^^^^^^^^
true dat but it is still nice sometimes, CrystalPhoenix. Vinyl Scratch being paired with dubstep and other things of the sort does make sense.
But wasn't she seen sitting down early in season 1?
My parents kept telling me to stop because of my swearing. But I'm almost an adult they can't tell me what to do!
kidzrul732: who didn't?
When most ponies were seen only laying down
Tie, it's ok and all but collectively accepting it as fact?
heck remember the whole eye incident
now i've run into a new bug
Tru, Tru
people made up excuses to keep her eyes red
it's sickening
I for one like the red eyes concept.
Is it cannon, No
Magenta is cuter, fits the universe more
^
My parents want me to stop swearing. But they can't tell me what to do
I hated her eyes red
<3 Magenta
i love cerulian
sudden silence
kidzrul732 well I agree with you to an extent, but consider that constantly swearing only dumbs down your vocabulary.
It did for me for years.

No... adultzrul732 :P

Ohai Sumi :P
transforming a good and yet depressing joke to a meme?

CrystalPhoenix, ...
CrystalPhoenix, now you made me feel bad ;~;
00,10so tired, and out of dew.
Sorry I guess I got a bit grumpy
0,5MY BRAAAAHND
00,10not fair life. its my day off I dont want to have to get dresed
13http://fav.me/d5po2wx

EFN**
of course it did lol
it piss me off though
dat applejack~
for 1 the original is way better
applegak?
for 2 there are way better songs than discord in general
The kick message should kick it self, saying the g word like that
I am offend and this makes me feel name

I firmly believe, however, that DJ-PON3 is her stage name. You don't see Deadmau5 using that name on his official papers.
I hope.
What is worst pony game? I think it is MLP Sim Date
OK GAIS WHICH COUPLE DO YOU THINK IS BEST SHIP?
fedex/ups
Pinkie X Gak

LyraXBonBon: Wait, there's an MLP sim date?
AdamTheDuck: Most disappointing ship
I will show you wait
Petrified_Discord, that's why I love it :P
LyraXBonBon: This is such a bad idea.

Hi DocSane :)
It's a pet, right?
those things from lord of the rings, right? :/
I was trapped watching the world's most boring game store all day.
DocSane: Foot Locker?
how do you watch a game store?

DocSane: Top Gun Weird Science Stare Master Pinkie Keen
ah
J_E_Smith71: Thanks.
gee, it sure is boring around here.
Dark_Horst: It's a pet we can dress up and make pretty. Doesn't require feeding, which makes it optimal as a cheaper alternative to more expensive, high-maintenance pets such as cats, dogs, and ponies.
Rex_Mundi: One of the best party games of all time... Of all time!
Ah... I just bought "Just Cause 2" for $3.72 on Steam.
Money well spent!

Okay, then we're all in order!

LyraXBonBon: Why.. Why not just say "girl" or "boy?"

All I think is abortion is wrong
Really
perhaps you should just watch an episode
DerpyMuffins He hasn't seen the show.
i'm watching an episode of my little pony
Wtf?
i know applejack
LOL^^^^
what episode?
1st episode
I suggest watching Winter Warp up
ah
smart man
start him off with mare on the moon
i was going to start with the new season but my friend says i have to watch in order
what about lesson zero?
Lesson Zero was all about Celestia trolling Twilight
in order is probably best lol thank Luna for netflix lol
"mah beats!!!!!!"
exactly
I know, so funny
lol i started at season 2 ep 19 for some reason
S3 was just to confirm head canons
Who else is in the series besides all of the ponies above(except the girl randomly looking @ spike)
And make references
msny many side characters
many
wait girl?
like human?
There is no human in Equestria
What G you watching?
lol
My friend told me about 3 background ponies
Huh
well he said girl, i assume human girl
Vinyl something
Vinyl Scratch.
derpy or something like that
and lyra
Dee Jay Pone Three.
aka DJ-PON3
who are they
Derpy Doo
The amount of people and lights inside generate more heat than necessary
Derpy Hooves/ Ditzy Doo.
Like you said, background ponies.
who is Lyra, i want to know
me
They even run air conditioners in the winter because it gets too hot.
*Facepalm*
Dat Derpy_Hooves
Really?
They have no major roles, they just stay in the background.
not that "Dat" reference
^
The fandom gave them their names.
derpy hooves is brony pony
ok
DashWithRainbows: some stick
Derpy was born on 4Chan
I'm done watching episode 1!
The fandom Gave her the name Derpy
NOT 4CHAN!
and its actually canon
I was banned for illegal post
bronies originated from 4chan
^
It's true.
^^
i put marijuana is for everyone
More specifically /co/.
.\/b/ to be exact
and i was banned
It grew on /b/ though...
well the term brony came from /b/
Good times
i finally understand ponies
Then there was spam
i joined around the fandom around gthe end of S1
after saying their names
Who is celestia anyways
Derpy_Hooves, actually it started on /co/ too. It just got popular on /b/ too.
Ninjazz: the term brony originated from /b/ though
Troll?Why?
Celestia is a troll
^
Oh wait, that was Celeste
Derpy_Hooves, I saw a screen cap of the very first time it was used, it was on /co/.
why are you guys just throwing fanon stuff at him D:
my friend wants me to join in fandom ASAP
"celestia is a troll" is a fanon
not canon
TheBucket: let him watch the episodes and videos, and then you ask
I'm from new orleans(Originally from atlanta/st.louis)
TheBucket He's new, he wouldn't get the joke.
exactly
Brb
BRB Everyone
I learned that from reddit today too
:P
Alrighty.
lol
WTF?
What
Just how many fanon Celestias have been made?
So, it's the end of 2012 on Tuesday...
I am in a flame war about kids watching porn
/r/wtf
DerpyMuffins: a lot :D
Cool story bro
Back
Celestia
the pony fandom is not meant for all, there are those who love it, those who are obessed with it, those who hate it, those who think it's cancer, and those who are forced/rushed into the fandom
don't even bother arguing with people about that stuff
Trolestia
I learned that a while ago
Molestia
Like skateboard rider cool
it's pretty much a waste of time
Wearing sunglasses
At night
i like my little pony
Uhh
Futashy > Fluttershy
In the middle of winter
it's cool
With some liquid nitrogen
DerpyMuffins: Tyrant Celestia
That's how cool it is
but i didn't think they like it THIS much
Eddmario: let's not bring that up pls :S
Tell it again sometime
i am in college
I am in LSU
La Salle?
I go to LSU
Lousiana State University
Oh

do what Derpy_Hooves said
Srsly, don't get involved with the fandom before you watch the episodes.

Derpy_Hooves is right
Ok sheesh

it will kill your soul
I checked out ponychan once, I didn't see anything bad with it.

Once only, though.
What changed?
TheBucket: look deeper
They think it is okay to watch
^
...
REALLY DEEPER

Why not?
"they" as in the more disgusting part of the fandom
Once more, unto the breach, then.
Let em watch it if they want.

It's not like you're going to change their opinion
a part we shouldn't talk about in this channel :V

that's not nice
no, i dont think it's because of the horse
omg :(
i dunno why
do you guys have horses irl? :)
i have one :)
its probably because its an optimistic happypic
i dont
that would be slavery
:(
probably
dont have enough cynism for ya
I;m back
ponybee: What happened after the punch? Anyone catch that?
I finally kicked his @$$
i sat there on my haunches and cried
yeah why did they punch you
just bc u were a brony
that's terrible
What happened?
because i came out as a brony and they couldn't handle it
wow
they need 2 clam down
not that serious you're just being who you are
i think i'll avoid them from now on
good idea
first i was gone beating up my friend for being a complete douche then for no reaso i am here
What happened?
it's jsut sad that at this time there are so many ignorant people
ia
ponybee? pony_mcdonalds? what happened?
i was gone and then this happened
by my own mother
g'night everypony

ponybee it is a sad time, nobody can accept other views, everyone considers themself superior
yeah
nite AVS619
what
Night AVS619 :)
omg
but i am superior
well i just became a brony and some of my classmates in LSU are bronies and douchebags
Well judging how usually our parents are from another generation with a very different way of thinking.
but nobody ever heeds my words
Not surprised.
i think they should add ponies that look more like real life ponies!
i love horses :)
i live with 3 douchebags and 1 brony
that sucks there should be brony love bw all bronies
next year i will live with 1 roomate, that's it
i used to live with roommates who would play video games all night and yell and keep me up
WTF it's quiet
do a lot of guys watch this show? :)
i used to be in a relationship where one guy was a brony and another guy hated it
what is a brony?
it was crazy like we pm broke up over it
:( I used to have roommates who would always talk when MLP came on
which is so ridic to me
like its a fun show
it was sooooo annoying
i've tried to find other bronies but it's not going well for me
Alipony, you go to a college
relationships should not end over that :(
maybe thats your own fault ponybee
:(
i've been wearing mlp shirts and everything
wow ponny

thank you sewpony!
what does bee stand for ponybee? :)
i like bees
so where is everyone from or does it not get that personal here XD
but by
why*
i dont like bees they sting :(
I'm from SC in the States ^_^
they make me feel good
the sting
the horse lovers at my university are frightening
thats awesome!
Should I get Forza 4 or Gran Turismo 5?
i dont think ponies and bees would get along :(
horse lovers or MLP lovers?
This is worse,I live in a dorm in LSU with 3 douchebags and 1 brony, one douche is drug addicted and one likes to drink alcohol, the other used to be a regular guy, till they recruted him
horses are majestic creatures
i agree!
pony_mcdonalds,i'm from New Orleans
Thry also don't like to be called horses
thats so cool i've had craaazy times in new orleans haha
One
maybe featured on a girls gone wild vid or too lol ;)

i don't use alcohol
2 out of every 5 people...

i've tried to get my mom to watch mlp but she just yells at me and makes fun of it
why would you
pony_mcdonalds: you mean you have been?
just
aww ponybee :(
Did you try watching without alcohol? Maybe they'll like it!
I'm living with only 1 roomate

http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-096
ponybee is kind of scaring me lol xD
ponybee FUCK HIM!
im just saying if you're watching a show that is aimed towards little girls then maybe you should reevaluate your life
*choice
That willc ripple your mind for a few weeks.
It's not porn. It's a story of an alien in the woods.
ponny then why are you here haha
ponny: so im guessing youre not a brony then?
ponny I revaluated it and it's AWESOME
its a fun show judging is for losers
ponny who are you to say these things?
stop oppressing us
you what annoys the piss out of me?
This is now an "Awkward moment when"
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama
berberborscing: ah yes, i have heard of this now lol
...Is it opressing when he's the only person in here agreeing to this?
ponny your mean
Derpy_Hooves: you accidentally the verb :P
im just being honest :(
ur being really rude
no your mean
i get u ponny ;)
Ponny Fluttershy is best poneh!
That's mean. :(
it's just my opinion, no offense meant
Instead of that fucker chasing me, I'd rather have 173 kick off my head
think before you say things, ponny
the bronies that are obsessed with the show, yeah i like the show, every saturday im all like "oh yay new episode" i watch it, then i get back to my life and get something productive done
ask us first
ponny okay...should I buy Breaking Bad First Season?
Derpy_Hooves: true

yes its a good show
I'm done watching episodes 5 6 and 7
Alright :D
Huzzah!

Done watching episodes 5 6 and 7
bourbon
Bronies do have personal lives! Except for the moderators...
On chat 24/7
what
Hey ponybee, how long have you been a brony?
The Mods are actually machines that are transplanted in the chat :p
but there are so i see every saturday that are "nothing is better than ponies" "ponies are the best" no, a job, having money to put food on the table, and friends/family
can we stop talking about personal lives? it's making me a bit jealous and oppressed
that is the best
you don't need a family
ok sheesh
its ok ponybee your not alone
I'm 13, so I ain't got no personal life. Just a sucky middle school one.
kids are annoying and you can't trust anyone
So true
Speaking of personal lifes, I got that FBI screen lock thing fixed :D
well i've been a brony since for a few months my last boyfriends got me in2
it
hold old is everyone here? :)
bite me Buytoast, my old man's father just kicked the bucket on thanksgiving
Ponny 18
remember me saying that?
it's so cute
In the end, you can only trust yourself and that edge you live on.
:D
how old*
i meant getting married and having children
I don't get XBox Live. They ask for your credit card information after you hear them rage on Black Ops 2 and get a 15 kill streak
and no
my girlfriend likes my little pony and she talked me into mlp
I dont
wow u have a gf
</3
haha
Don't want my ears to ring from screaming 10 year olds.
...

i just became a brony now
hey! i'm 10 :(
i dont have a girlfriend
hey! i'm 20
Sew
how old are u josh haha :D

Sorry if i offended you
im 17
i've never had a girlfriend. all the girls i've known were whores
top tip people
im 20
i'm 16 :)
so i have a question: is ponny a brony, or is he a troll that is taking the "calm, nice, and professional" approach?
can't trust them
you need to be at least 14 to be here
Sorry, sewpony. You probably shouldn't be in here. +14 chat recommended.
o great i'm 19!
are you in college
It's alright. As long as we don't curse or post porn, we should be fine.
so at least pretend youre 14 and dont break the rules
not right now
i just waitress
what college you gonna go to pony
I am in lsu
i dont know yet
Hey guys...the FBI screenlock virus/trojan I got last night is fixed now :P
i'm just a person who really likes horses :)
Deadlypon3: how did you fix it
Deadlypon3: cool
i just like to go with the flow u know

This Canada Dry stuff tastes the same as Sprite AND Mountain Dew AND Sierra Mist... Intriguing...
i owned a horse once! begged my mom to buy it
twilight_sprinkle I dunno. I let my stepmother at it ^^'
who hates this slideshow?
how much do you like horses, ponny?
thats what i want to know.
i'm staying with this guy right now and he pays for all my stuff
a lot :)
Deadlypon3: okay lul
so i dont have to worry about much
I'm kidding bro
i dream about them a lot
twilight_sprinkle computers scare me :'(
he is taking the professional calm approach
I like horses, but not the sexual way.
what kind of dreams? :O
They always die on me
nice choice
Done With Episode 8
wait, is it wrong to like horses in a sexual way?
most trolls don't use that option'
I like the series so far
Deadlypon3: eh you should learn to use them well
i thought this was an open place
berberborscing that's a given ^^'
ponybee, people do
okay, good
twilight_sprinkle NOPE
Donte thought all of us were furries and raged
ikr
I told him" What are you doing here then?"
i sometimes dream about what it would be like to be a horse :)
"episodes"? that's insulting, cristian_carter

I want that dream. To be in Equestria. Much better world.

first these guys told me about this then ponies
I use to be a pony...then I took another drug and overdosed
Economy doesn't go through the ground

what's a /b/tard
i've always wanted to have sex with a pony but i never know what to do
what is /b/?
snowpony, im running through a grassy field with my pony girlfriend
how do i initiate it?
And school is not as bad as it is in real life
i thought you were gonna say arrow to the knee Deadlypon3
lol
No such things as "killing"
/b/ is a part of the site 4chan

sewpony: yeah. but i wouldnt recommend going there, it can be a nasty place
Ashushing.
The best there is. c:
I thought I was going to be arrested for my pony love by the FBI when I realized a Virus/Trojan locked me out of my computer ponybee
ponny: but there are rules and regulations that go along with being here
twilight_sprinkle what is ponychan?

When I say screaming 10 year old kids, that doesn't mean your a rager if your 10. You know who you are. ^^
yes and it is ponychan
no
is it fun?
i try to hang around 10 year olds but they get scared ofme
/mlp/ on 4chan is not ponychan

Come join me in Perth fluttercry, I've got lots of spider holes to show you.
Wink wink.
/me slaps Ninjazz around a bit with a large trout
05,15That's quite alright, I'm already deathly afraid of spiders I don't need ones that can kill me in 15 minutes
I let spiders live in my room, it's fun.
05,15also, Box Jellyfish
Jeesus Jaymeow.
05,15lolnope
I wanna be stung by a jellyfish.
its not so bad here
fluttercry: Actually Cassowary (or Kasuari in the local language) are from West Papua. West Papua is part of Indonesia, not Australia
05,15I'll stay here in the eastern US where all I have to worry about are Black Widows and Rattlesnakes
box spider jellyfish
Dont forget the Sharks
Ninjazz, what? They're cool to let them roam around and make families.
I read that as Battlesnakes.
05,15Jmo they can also KILL YOU
Sep. 29th, 2421, Asteroid 1999 RQ36 will be 511,000 kilometers from Earth. (really fuckin close)
Na
fluttercry: Maybe you're talking about Emu birds?
05,15Java maybe
I leave them alone, they leave me alone.
I feed them, they treat me well and eat the flies.
That's like as close as the moon.
Jaymeow, spiders disturb me. My brother freaks the fuck out but I just hate their legs.
Maybe everyone all over the world need to yell "GO AWAY METEOR" and the meteor will be like "Okay"
I wish I had a camera when I was living on the farm
05,15Java Cassowaries live in the NE of Australia
Oh the spiders we had there. <3
05,15ARE THERE ANY SAFE PLACES THERE?
fluttercry: Papua too.
e_e
I own one once.
only the tough survive in Australia
The meat is good, a little bit hard though
I should Straya and Zealand sometime, and bonus I won't be jetlagged bad.
Come join me darling.
I have trout waiting.
I can't wait.
05,15So, the water is filled with box jellyfish that can kill you in minutes, sharks, and stingrays. The land is filled with dingos, funnel web spiders, giant birds, and snakes.
Even though I like Bird of Paradise more http://www.breakaway.cc/Wildlife/asia/birdParadise01.jpg
05,15How do people survive!
Common sense.
And survival instincts.
The box jellyfish don't kill you in minutes. You just feel agony for a good long while then die.
Wait, this guy is from Perth.
Jmo is master survivor
im from Perth
Ninjazz: That's not helping :/
When he said your but and the chair, I assume that 99.9 % of people watch science videos with﻿ pants on.
Java, blame the Discovery Channel.
05,15On the bright side, they are able to copy UK shows without ruining them
05,15unlike us
Damn
Another Perth person
At least they don't have the ugly Barnacle....
hello
Wanna know something crazy? It's impossible to touch anything!
Ninjazz, I'll sting you <:
>~<
05,15and Japan has GIANT FUCKING HORNETS
Jmo: Ooooh kinky
A science video says nobody can touch anything
I can't touch my keyboard.

XAX: What car is that? A Vauxhall?
05,15things I hate: Spiders, Bees, Wasps, Ants, Centipedes, and silverfish
XAX, that's when people try to drive to Hawaii
I love spiders. :D
05,15I hate hate hate hate hate hate wasps and bees
You'd love Australia
We got all of those.
fluttercry: Spiders are awesome
the only things i really hate are Spiders and snakes
Spiders rule.
XAX, lol'd.
but you get used to these things in Australia
fluttercry: Try to google hag fish
Except some don't get used to the heat.
EHERM.
true
05,15Snakes are fine, hell I've fought snakes and won. But I cry like a bitch when bees and wasps are around
wat. >_>
hahahaha
I enjoy being stung by bees, tis interesting.
Once I was parked in my car at Blockbuster with my window open and a bee landed in my lap.
Jmo: Hot? I don't feel hot at all when I was in Melbourne.
Quick quiestion: who here is excited to hear that Animainiacs are comeing to the Hub on the 7th?
im fine with bees and wasps, man i just got stung by a wasp yesterday
You know what I did?
Good :P
Noir: Someone need to stream animaniacs here in Bronystate
I got a piece of paper, pushed him on, and stuck it out the window saying "Your free!"
05,15A wasp flew into my house once and I responded by locking the door to my room (what's it going to do, open it?) and stuffed blankets under the door so it couldn't get in.
lel
u funny fluttercry
Did you also cry?
fluttercry: Law of funny: It will get in.
I learned a really valuable lesson w/ wasps and bees
I know how to TAME them.
LOl^
05,15No, I didn't cry, I had the situation under control
Then they tamed you.
fluttercry, I know dat feel so much ;~;
I'm sure fluttercry :P
Be calm, and no sudden movements.
Do not pose a threat.
the worst i have everdone was throw my phone at a spider in my room.... poor phone, it never recovered
05,15I had bad experiences with stinging bugs when I was little
should have used the stare on it :)
05,15so I guess the fear just stuck with me
I learn a good life lesson today: Don't eat too much instant noodles or we will get bad bowel movement.
I still wanna find out why Olly is scared of moths
Once I was getting in the class from P.E in 1st grade, and out of all things, a queen bee stung my arm three times.
brb toilet
05,15I also am not a fan of the dark
At least it wasn't a snake.
fluttercry, you should put on a bee keeper costume and go to a place with a bunch of bees
hi
I prefer the dark.
^
stepping on a yellowjacket nest barefooted didnt feel exactly pleasant
<berberborscing> gets all the beeches
SCP's hide in the dark...
i saw bees in a building
but they were in a case with honey comb
I know why you prefer it Ninjazz
making honey i think
Teehee
a beehive :)
05,15Getting stung in the face by a wasp when you are 4 is not fun
>_>
Of course you know. <_<
/me slaps Ninjazz around a bit with a large trout
i was ... 6 i think
Oh, people are talking. XD
:>
Well, mine was a queen bee.
Worst that happened to me when I was young was I nearly broke my spine.
being outside barefoot near bees flying and buzzing is scary
It can sting you multiply and get away with iot
a little :P
05,15Jmo ouch
when you are little :\
I'm tired -_-
It wasn't fun.
let me tell you, yellowjackets sting like a bitch
i almost ate a yellow jacket
same
05,15worst injury I've ever sustained was impaling my foot on a mini refridgerator coil
I'm a bit warned around wasps and tellow jackets.
my cousin saved me and said wait
that was recently too :\
oh redbacks why are there soooo many FUCKING redbacks here in Australia
lolredbacks
i hate redbacks
It would be like a chest X-Ray if you ate 600 bananas.
with a passion
Why?
Rofl.
i broke my head once

05,15HEY
05,15Indiana Jones is only afraid of snakes
I am not inherently afraid of anything, including snakes
For me, an odd kind of Flutteshy happens.
00,10still kinda nice to find my old EA games.
however, that does not mean that if I am asleep in the lounge in the back yard and a snake crawls on me, I am not gonna scream like a little girl :p
05,15I was stalked by a bear once
05,15that was fun
Pedobear coming after you son.
Could have been a dude in a bear suit.
That shit happens, maaaaan.
did he have a van with "free candy" on the side?
05,15unless a man in a bear suit was living in the mountains for no reason
05,15I doubt it
fluttercry: Just bear with it.
haha:D
>_>
Live in the mountains to make sure he doesn't caught. It's possible, maaaaaaan.
05,15But yeah, I used to live in a mountainous area and I was hiking with my Dad, ended up having to get out without freaking out and spooking the bear even more
I read it as "spooning the bear" :/
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlsFGtdSPcI -- this is probbably what he wanted :p
did it want a cookie?
05,15It wanted Fluttercry-Cookies

I'm gonna make you guys go crazy with hardest question evfer.
This question is so hard even Twilight was stumped.
bring it on
What color...
...is a mirror?
Yo mamma.
it doesnt have a color
it's yellow
its a refelction of the person so clear
spy
mettalic silver?
Yellow!
05,15Green?
Blue.
Actually, old time mirrors were made with silver.
So...
gold?
wouldnt it be multaple colours since it reflects light and in light there are seven colours mixed togethor
YELLOW!
silvier alluminum
The winner is:
Fluttercry.
GAH!
?
05,15I thought that was what I'd heard. Yay me!
its green silver
05,15also, you all need to check out a flash game called Frog Fractions
If you look through infinite mirrons like in an elevator
You'll see it dims into a hue of dark green.
those are creepy
It reflects green color best.
what is the meaning of life
05,15Watch Monty Python and you'll know
seen it
forgot the answer
Fetch the cow
The meaning of life is survival.
i really want to go to bronycon

Good morning SirGanjalf
Along with some Muenster
hey SirGanjalf
hi SirGanjalf
ello SirGanjalf
Hiyo SirGanjalf
Hi SirGanjalf :)
hello SirGanjalf
don't get too attached to them
Hey i got a question for everypony in the chat: how do you use skype?
inb4 Sumi dies
just noticed that face at the bottom right of stream
xD
activate the weapons
Moopy: What do you mean?
Can it run on old computers? like 7 years old laptop with pentium celeron 1.7 and 2 GB ram?
I repeat, activate the weapons!
you know like how to use skype
Moopy: What do you mean "how to use it"?
take their rum
Moopy: Be specific
You don't know what im talking about do you Gold_Demona?
Moopy: Now you're confusing me.
*SIGH*
Moopy: I thought I did, but now I don't know.
Good guy Sumica, sdon't accept any bribe!
ded
did you start on normal level, Sumica? you will die quickly.
Moopy: I just don't get what you mean by "use" Skype.
Just forget it Gold_Demona
I never beat the game on normal
DaringDerpy, hehe, normal is brutal XD
DaringDerpy is a baaaaaabeh!
:p
Sumica, you have no idea how hard normal is :P
Spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace
Moopy: Well, what exactly are you trying to do with it? Are you trying to add people to your list? Are you trying to chat with someone? Are you trying to find someone? How exactly are you "using" it specifically?
Cuz just saying "use it" doesn't really say anything.
Really Gold_Demona you had to ask all that......................really
/me bites Java's head off
Sumica, get someone to repair the shields
Moopy: Well....?
ded
/me grew another new head in seconds
inb4 ships blows up
No comment
what's this then?
Sumica The irony of shizu burning to death
open the blast doors
this that SPAZ game?
Shizuuuu nuuuu XD
fire needs oxygen
Poor captain got scorched
sumi is best space pilot
not all of them
Yeah, stay the course!
it dies
93 XD
new high score
And now Sumica become a baby :p
they will all die
should of had a Normal and Hard mode insted of Easy and Normal
this fire was nothing dramatic. you could have survived it with a full crew and a slightly damaged ship
I must demand you get a crew cosisted entirely of psycho midgets... I play too much borderlands...
shield first, then weapons
hull breach
anyone else get an add just now?
Repair drone? sounds good
most of us have adblock, Etharian
if the useless sensors worked, you knew where
:'(
Sumica, jump out and then repair
oh, right
Etharian: Go get adblock or ghostery
Sumica, FTL out I mean
how do I get adblock
Etharian: What browser do you use?
Sumica, first off, the room with the camera
are you trying to down load google chrome dude
this is bad
Sumica, allows you to see the ship without the crew having to check
Chrome
Sumica, then the room with the 2 rectangles allow you to control the locks on the doors remotely
Etharian: Go get ghostery. It's available for Opera and Chrome
k thx
look at which are open
Don't down load chrome dude it makes the youtube videos lag a little and it makes it makes the sound videos in slow motion
only the weapon room has vacuum
Technology this advanced and they don't have automatic fire extenguisher system
Sumica, as you can see they are both destroyed and you need both of them to 1 see where the fire is, and 2 to starve the fire of oxygen by opening the right doors
at least the oxygen didn'T fail
or fire extenguisher bot
Sumica, just open all the doors except the med room and the fire will go away
curse this delayed stream >.>
everything's cool
you just lost two redshirts
everything else is fine
Only 1 crew remaining? poor guy for a maiden voyage
Bye Wrek :<
/me sits on AdamTheDuck 's head
D:
/me uses splash on Ponies47 >:3
;~;
I can imagine the crew is like "yay we explore the space!" but after 1 battle "OH GOD WHY?!"
saving is for casuals
you can save but if you die it deletes the save
Sumica, no save, one life and that's it :P
Welcome to FTL~
If you mastered FTL, try Dwarf Fortress
cough
took me like....3-4 tires to beat it on easy
taoumi: and on normal?
5-7
taoumi: That's a lot of tires
better than me. I never beat it on normal
that engi ship does wonders
this game is reminding me of kerbals
shields go in blocks of two
the ion cannon is a far under rated wepon DaringDerpy
Sumica, shields are different, you need 2 upgrades for one shield block
kerbals 2.0
well, I got to, it's 4:30 am over her >.>
here*
go*
Goodnight thelonecubone :$
damn it >.<
buy the ion cannon first chance.
night thelonecubone
/me tucks thelonecubone into bed :P
octavia you wanted me a peace of that ca~ 0-o
night thelonecubone
Sumica, attack!
cya thelonecubone
aim for the shields with the first shot, then for the weapons
thanks for the stream Sumica :)
inb4 ded
if you are lucky, they have no chance to fire at you
Yeah, attack those rebel-i mean, slaver scums!
ooh,
Green skinned slave girl?
you have freed them from life too:P
loot
the lewt!
Windows has encountered a problem with your entire computer. It seems to have been replaced with a giant potato.
At least potato taste good stewed with meat.
time to cook some ramen
:>
What happened to good-guy Sumica? XD
I need to go get me some breakfast.
See you in a bit Gold_Demona :P
Gold_Demona: KFC breakfast?
Java: Hell no. Real breakfast. A nice big bowl o' cereal.
Or a plate of scrambled eggs. I haven't decided
only if the shield is down
Gold_Demona: But they are good! http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VfTGSRAoPiY/T4BqcLCauiI/AAAAAAAAGpY/2oHqGBcIKnU/s1600/13287-thumb-323399_10150292176545843_63398470842_8521810_163957571_o.jpg
cough
I don't do fast food breakfast. =/
the ion cannon cna strip shilds and turn off a system if i hits directly
Besides, the closest KFC to me is too far away to be worth the trouble
Gold_Demona: It only took me 5 minutes to walk to the nearest KFC
I win
Also that would mean leaving my house, which would mean getting dressed and decent and doing my hair and all this other crap I don't feel like doing.
just keep the ion cannon aimed at eather sheilds or wepons
Just wear a white t shirt and wear a short jeans or something
I don't change out of my PJs unless I'm intent on leaving the house.
And my hair's a pain in the ass
Go to KFC in you pj then
let it wild
XD
Ew no
Leave the house looking like a redneck, I don't think so.
gona need the power and sheilds
can alwase turn it on if they get husrt
the sickbay is good for fighting boarding crews
take it
What exactly is the object of this game? O_o
to get to the other side Gold_Demona
Gold_Demona, get from one side of the galaxy to the other
to get to the infinity and beyond!
Wait, why do we try to get there again taoumi?
*
cough
becasue plot? AdamTheDuck
So I guess the bar thingy on top is your progress across the galaxy? Cuz I don't actually see any movement
taoumi, were we trying to deliver something? I can't remmeber
remember*
no i think we were just going on a rampage AdamTheDuck
is he a member of alien bug-people race?
taoumi: That's like asking why the chicken crossed the road.
why?
sector 1
well it's the truth
sector 10 has the final boss
don't risk it
oh well
What is this? Gamma-ray burst?
hmm... nah, i doubt you could escape that
gota love that ion cannon
cough
Good guys space pirates
One Piece?
in space?
Become king of the space pirates?
panic!
Gold_Demona: Sounds good to me!
Why is it my time of sense is always messed up this last week of the year.. I woke up thinking "Yay, Saturday, Ponehs!" :'(
Choices choices choices
pirate is more profitable ... kinda
Space Engineers!
Need a dispenser on that moon!
Canebridge: Well, at least you can watch it on youtube
where do you get the cloak ship, taoumi?
Engi are weird green guys who repair faster than humans
mhmm
engis are squishier than humans
oh um..... no idea
True Java - I've just grown to love watching it here, with the crazy chat along - Ack well
no
never got it. or rather didn't care to DaringDerpy
and i return :>
oh
don't
ok
Burn the ship
Where's the giant can of raid?
giant alien spider are srs bsns
didn't know you can win against the spiders
i thinks it's because he has a bug
oh
badum tish?
BTW: Was FTL in HumbleIndieBundle already?
Weeee are explooooring the spaaaaace and we're going to diiiiieeeeeeee
SirGanjalf, not that I recall
what am i doing... i should be stuffign vynal
SirGanjalf: I remember it is for Royal Bundle?
It's dangerous to go alone. Take this.
you need a drone control center. but that will split your scrap even more
Sumica, it's a drone, your ship can't man drones
Java: You may be right, cause i recall it being in some bundle
Sumica, sell it at the next store you meet
i would sugjest min maxing into wepons
Put Royal, Humble and Indie gala on your quick shortcuts
wepons :p
fule
Fuelle?
lel
...n-no.no nooo
Sumica: FOR JUSTICE! no pirates shall escape my grasp of JUSTIIIIIICCCCCEEEEEE!!!!!
cough cough
it's caled buying a smartship?
Whose side are you on in this game anyway?
the good side
Space marine?
the light side?
all your dones
for drones
Sell them
drones that you don't have a contol for
using a drone costs one drone part
sell them
Sumica, well drone parts are used for drones which you can't use on your ship anyway
more sheilds moar power
drones are overrated
<3 Drones though LM
:< *
asteroids are cool when the enemy has weak shields

FTL
Faster Than Light

Can you go back to civilian ship, or are they already dead?
the green slaves are good. they give one unit of energy to the system they work on
More explorations = more loot

Looks cool
Faster Than Light - FTL
hey guys!
engi ship
what game is this?
is it always real time?
Faster Than Light - FTL
Ah
it's hard for me to concede that something that always runs in real time is a roguelike
i do't know, 40 scraps?
yesterday... wood got in my foot D:
*don't
hey
Hello Gaige
Oh Sumica, you do know there's autofire right?
You can switch between shots
like while it recharges
it just makes it so you won't have to look at how charged your weapons are
some times holding fire is benificial AdamTheDuck
isnt that how you could have got a ship
what is this game name?
FTL faster then light
Hmm an augment
specialy w/ the ion cannon AdamTheDuck. can wait till it hits and strips the sheilds then fire
taoumi, true
huh didnt know that o.o apparently the VA for Sweetie and Babs are the daughters of the VA of Goku and Vegeta :D kinda funny since Babs was a bully at first then became a friend to the CMC like Vegeta to Goku lol
I
cough
just bought this
it's only $7.49
only
this game is unfair as hell
how $2?
Sketch_Toku_Brony: To be specific, Sweetie Belle's VA's dad was the voice for the Canadian dub Goku. :P
bundle perhaps
well shit
Gold_Demona: ah i see :P i read it was a dub just not the nationality :$
still $8 not much of a hit
Sketch_Toku_Brony: And I just looked it up, same is true for Babs. Canadian dub Vegeta.
Gold_Demona: huh neat
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Which is my preferred English-speaking Vegeta, personally.
is this multiplayer?
Stopwatch, nope
good i actually fucking hate multiplayer
Gold_Demona: lol now if only we could hear Babs say its over 9000,lol jk
lol
Sketch_Toku_Brony: LOL, Yeah. That's the correct Vegeta, too. XD
if you guys can't into Toshio Furukawa gtfo
:D
Stopwatch: Who?
i think that was Japan Vegeta
Ah
Only Japanese voice actors I know are the ones in Lupin the Third. lol :D
or that might have been piccolo
you gotta get into Akira Kamiya and Norio Wakamoto at least
you've probably seen something with them
moar power + moar O2 :(
Instead of the Canadian one
people...
Horikawa Ryo was Japanese Vegeta
should i enter the peice in the contest?
o.O
he and Toshio Furukawa both awesome
cough
S THIS?
what game is this?
FTL
Gold_Demona: hai :D muffin?

it looks like it needs one
aniderp|bestcakeever: Hi! And yes! =D

hello Rocket
omgwtf guys look at this sale on steam
-75% $
and?
i'll finally buy bioshock
good for you o.o
Rocket: Steam's been doing this since Chrsitmas. :P
Steam.. its like Facebook for gamers..
Gold_Demona i dont look at steam so often ;_;
But they rotate their games around so you have to check back to see which games are for sale.
every day their a sale
and the ocasion flash sale
Rocket: Probably for the better. I throw a lot of money into Steam sales. >.>
it because of steam sale Im broke
Goodnight SuperBrony64|Zzz
11,02night :3
LightTrooper105, http://www.iruntheinternet.com/lulzdump/images/wallet-steam-sale-wat-r-u-doing-stahp-1356634345o.jpg
SuperBrony64|Zzz night
night SuperBrony64|Zzz
I usually check the Steam store every time I turn Steam on.
that is 100% true AdamTheDuck
AdamTheDuck haha :D
More often than not I end up adding stuff to my wishlist, but sometimes something will be on sale that I want.
AdamTheDuck: LOL XP
if its on my wishlist or that game I had plan to buy before.. if its on sale its insta buy for me...
which is terrible habit
Same here LightTrooper105
Well i dont buy games on steam, i buy games in shops :{
And yes, that is a terrible habit. >.>
o2 was off
Rocket: I buy on Steam because it means I don't have to leave my house to get the game. :P
Or wait for shipping
*shrugs*
maybe you clicked without noticing
or if you had to uninstall you dont need to worry about the cd key
^
^^
also my grief with this game was is that it's pure gambling
But now all games saving cd kay in steam so :D
whether you win or not has nothing to with skill. jsut luck
its quite annoying that every game now have to be on steam
not all now
eince EA got its own one
Origin...
indeed..
What a nightmare
I had to contact EA support just so I could change my name...
wow....
But most of games moves to steam for example Warband
and most Indie Game goes to steam aswell
Rocket, it's not like Steam is providing a bad service
I think Steam is convenient.
AdamTheDuck i know but i had to buy Warband again ._.
Steam is indeed convenient
try me buying Company of heroes 3 times
the last one I bought on steam
Oh did Sumi die?
Rocket: Why'd you have to buy it again? Did you lose the one you had?
Stick isn't perfect but i like to stick to one platform of digital distribution
hello lads !!!
yes..
I was gone for a bit
*Steam, lol
you were in a nebula....might have been fire?
is it possible your life support systyms were damaged?
The nebula killed half your power
eww
huh intresting...
Gold_Demona Well i dunno, it was like they moved Warband to steam and they did new servers and they leaved you with useless game in hand
now I see why you dont like nebulas
oh i see, electromagnetic charges?
Rocket: That didn't make any sense to me. But maybe it's because I know nothing of Warband, so I don't know how that works. O_o
Sumica: if you click autofire you won't have to reset the target after every burst
lol
missiles. they're epensive, you have few and half the time they friggn miss
Gold_Demona its old game and i have no idea why i couldnt play it more, maybe i had bug
hate em
Rocket: Could just be it was just too old for your system. That happens.
Gold_Demona maybe, i had 4 years old laptop :D
Rocket: In which case you would have to buy a newer one that's more compatible with your system.
Rocket: So that's not Steam's fault. It's the fault of the age of your game. :P
Rocket: Steam did you a favor by having it available on their thingy.
usually if old games get sold on steam, they have been tweaked to work on modern systems
I really need to play more Warband >.>
Right, what Dark_Horst said
AdamTheDuck d-d-d-d-duel!
GOG.com is a really good site to get some super old games. Only catch is you need to have DOS Box installed on your system, but that's not an issue since it's free.
This game intrigues me, I am thinking about buying it on steam...but im not sure.
well, you need dos box for every dos gamre
Fing ad!
Dark_Horst: Yeah, I'm just saying it's a requirement for most games you get on GOG. Because of the fact that they're DOS-based games.
'sup guys
AdamTheDuck i remember when i played it long ago, i was in clan :D 20 people, this was really funny
Ohai Chrysalis
ohai Chrysalis
oooh FTL
Rocket, I bought it for Mount and Musket really but I never took the time to fully learn how to play the game
i have warband too
picked this up in the sales, any good
you guys really need the crpg mod
you really do
whats that red stuff that looks like its going to engulf the system?
Dark_Horst i played crpg
Dark_Horst: whats it do?
its that cloaking!
Rocket, "that adds persistent character leveling and to player-vs-player combat. "
best in warband are mods for me
Chrysalis: it makes the multiplayer actually interesting
Chrysalis it adds football mod
crpg works with the browser. ingame you earn money and exp which you can then spend on their homepage to buy new weapons and armor for your character. you also level up
I just like to play the Warband napoleoni
and use skillpoints and stuff
-sigh-
What's wrong aniderp?
o.o
ah hell
I'm out, best of luck this playthrough.
everything again..
take care Etharian
and again?
i constantly fight myself :\
Fight yourself? How does once go about doing that?
o.o
You can do many things with yourself, AdamTheDuck.
true..
one go about*
okay what is that red wave?
im not hurting myself.. i go through insanity without it and i feel i need to but i dont
what wrong with insanity?
ah, damn. They just throw a lot of shit your way huh?
i feel like hurting but...
i gight myself not to..
fight
You know what? eat a chocolate, that always works
it not working
to a point, Rocket is actually correct
i have eaten some
Rocket: I saw the Zecora thread.
:[
try doing something else to get that out of your mind
it wont leave my mind
sleeping.. helps tiny bbut then it comes back
KrazyNoobs hahahaaaaaah
dafuq, boarding?
aniderp|bestcakeever

well the problem will eventaully go away
aniderp|bestcakeever: Awesome. You sure that isn't enough to cheer you up?
Or...
im sure
stop whatever is going on?
so, this was a red giant?
i feel like crying also..
Then cry
aniderp|bestcakeever, just keep cool, I'm sure you'll get better in no time
Ponies don't work? Go find an expert.
yeah then cry
Crying is healthy
its best to let it out then keeping it
aniderp|bestcakeever why is that all ?
Crying always makes you feel better afterwards.

Even though one of them is an AI based on a human brain-map, and the other one was an AI... with no basis other than a goal.

I've been having trouble identifying the continuity of this series, at least as of the first season. And for one episode of Season 2 to be part 2 of a non-produced part 1 doesn't make things any easier.
Sumica: sleep or i steal your vita
gangnam style on :D
00,10that's kinda the joke though Kandarihu
god my parents gonna kill me
Sumica, you can sleep in my bed :3
Sumica, indeed.
00,10and if i sleep it makes it easyer to take Bronysith
/me sits on Rose`Bed lap
/me is unow useless
I never watch this series before. Only people raving about it
rrawr~
00,10but my bed is comfortable
So this is a parody of Johnny Quest?
-hands plushie of rainbow dash to Rose`Bed
Sumica: i know, but easier is boring T~T

Sumica: Thanks.
Adultswim is weirdly funny
yes, i can hear you
i like how these guys find humor without cussing all that much
even though they still do >.>
/me thinks harder
This is so fucking weird
Simon, this is one of the best shows made for Adult Swim. Most of the rest are just plain depraved.
/me wakes up crying
Kandarihu: Oh?
I love Doctor O
im a fan of catboys <3
Hai everypony
00,10sorry Rose`Bed, all I have is an inuyasha cosplay I was forced to go as many years back

/me hands Rose`Bed some icecream cake
HEYOOOO
What the S-Force don't know, that's not road. That's a Basketball court.
Giant robot fight!
GilDash Who cares? They live in Jersey.

Gee, apparently Ender never thought of small high-yield missiles with high manuverability before.
00,10kiva face palm

I really gotta stop snarking over everything. I REALLY gotta be better about that.
I don't think I can say this enough: I love this show.
00,10but snark is fun
00,10snark is the whole point of movie night
Kandarihu: Being British, I'm quite enjoying all the snark you provide. :)
But I'm becoming the kind of jerk that I'm trying to fight against.
brb
Good thing he landed on them robots
Kandarihu: Come over to the dark side... we have cookies.
00,10you are hardly a jerk Kandarihu
nobody destroys jersey but coop!
You know, at that rate, he could have the entire Earth destroyed in...oh a good 200 years or so?

-hands Rose`Bed a cape also-

Kandarihu: I'd rather see Megas carried on... nah, it'd be ruined with modernisation.
^

aniderp|bestcakeever: Megas XLR.
im listening to zelda music and watching show xD
grog! grog! grog!
00,10I want a replicater
so i have no clue what they are saying
ahah
GilDash, I hear that given the tradition of Coop ultimately being responsible for every problem that comes up, if the series were continued, it would've been established that Coop CREATED the Glorft
it kept waiting
XD
hey y'all, happy sunday
rose like the cape i got you?
Ohai Deacon :)
eh, its alright
Kandarihu: I've not actually seen all of this, but I'd be incredibly surprised ig he hasn't already done so. XD
i got the wrong color didnt i? D:
That cape is FABULOUS!
GilDash, no. Not in the episodes that were actually produced. But I hear that's what was planned.
it is a harsh and retched place :3
Kandarihu: Again, that doesn't surprise me one bit. XD
oh, megas eh? k
im sorry it was hard cause things where chasing me ;_;
i want goth chicks
pfft... no complaining about the type of donut?
00,10always wind in his hair

CrystalPhoenix: D:

You've not met Coop before...
Shit goes down when he's around.
00,10dont ever melee kiva
Yeah, that seems like a bad idea...
he cheats
Whenever she knocks out her enemy, it goes into a slide show
Dem redheads
00,10kinda like the blue chick with redhair
was that last one on the right a guy ?
00,10yes

Rocket, by his wrists iirc
just wondering
00,10J_E_Smith71 because no timers have been set
00,10we only could go up to new year
!cd
Episode 11 of season 3 "Keep Calm and Flutter On" airs in 19 days, 22 hours, 4 minutes, 50 seconds (Jan 19 15:30:00 2013 UTC)
wait, that;s next?
so when are the timers being updated?
Three weeks until new poni. :(
00,10when the new year starts
Oooh, Kiva rant time.
Sumica: Which time zone?
Oh, that sounded like a funny glitch.
Almost as cheesy as Coops sandwhich
Sumica: I know the No Dates isn't a glitch I was just mentioning I had the timer stuck on No Bad Apple on this laptop all week
Braviary you can handle it, you've handled 3 1/2 months of no ponies ;)
Form Blazing Sword
Barely.
00,10probably est cause that's the time zone the site uses
The button said "That cool energy sword thing" XD
pyrocatboy: That dashboard has new controls every single episode, pretty much.
00,10sound in space
HAha
GilDash: Thats because coop is constantly adding features
The physics is so bad
the dashboard is like castlevania, a being of chaos
La Cucaracha > Laws of physics
00,10"totqaly not the same button coop pressed before"
Fl00t4sh41: I know, but it's made funnier by the fact what was there before is replaced. XD
looks like dead space
Oh shut up and explode already...
Poor captain Harlock
Context sensitive buttons are best buttons

Should have fired your overkill
Needs more
Lololololol
Ehh close enough
Ohhhhh
Should have used more overkill
Wabam
Sumica: Schlock?
00,10wut?
Inb4 more serious shit
Mexican stand off
That quote; it's from Schlock Mercenary no?
00,10throwing up the horns
DANG

Not quite a Mexican Standoff because they're both firing.

Not the Conveniently Placed Oil Refinery!
jcelios: You calling it robotception?
Let us build an oil refinary here!
inb4 it actually does things.
Dat magic
yoink
You could have done that the whole time?
Nope
Dude, the fuck.
So many buildings.
There goes New Jersey
Who cares it's New Jersey
again
and nothing of value was lost
Cosmic: Its only New Jersey. Nothing of value is lost
xD
And they just stand there and watch the Test Pattern
I know your pain prisoners
00,10rant
b4 internet
Destroy ALL the City
Suddenly dat guitar
I love how this is legal.
ofc there was no people in buildings?
I think DVD-R will be Coop's best friend in the future
maser refracor?
maser protons?
Wonder if he rigs Megas to have Wi-Fi in the future
Fail
00,10why do we have a gun
00,10that gives enemys a shield
i think it's a play on meson
Sumica: Could use it on an ally
He should just install his entertainment center in MEGAS
Inb4 he gets defeated again
0,5I am LC #1
just give him some electrons?
Such predictable storylines
Mexican standoff
00,10the secondary bridge has alot of it Kandarihu
Dark_Horst: nah masers are an actualy thing, not realated to mesons
/me wears his #1 soda drinking hat.
I'MMA FIRIN' MA LAZOR
hm
Yes, yes you are.
/me slaps BaconMane around a bit with a large trout
00,10macross time
o.o
suddenly GUN
seems legit
Dakkka time
overkill much?
/me slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
Sumica, Kiva knew about it. It was probably added to MEGAS by the Earth Military in the distant future. And Coop discovered it and mistook it for a weapon.
Oh no, Jersey
A heavy nuclear bomb
Lmfao.
00,10big badda boom
And that's why Jersey is such a shithole
New Jersey destroyed, world a much better place
DerpyMuffins: Do you really care about Jersey being nuked?
really no ones going to say it?
fiiiiine....
You can't read sarcasm can you?
boobies

Rant?

That shit is indestructable
And nothing of value was lost.
Yeah, that explosion looks large enough to affect New York City.
Eh what's one more big city destroying explosion on this show?
Reversed the polarity of the neutron flow?
apparently xD
Cosmic: Anti-neutron flow!
Oh shit
:D
Ded.
And the remote gets trashed
lol
That was anticlimactic
00,10and the day is saved
Cosmic it was protons :D
Not Jersey, though.
dat trumpet
all's well that end's well
fuck jersey
XD
Lmfao.
That dude.
Who the hell's that dude?

They smuggled him into the drive-in movie
Never fail to laugh. Ever.
Simon: Goat
Wendee Lee is in this?
And forgot about him in all the fighting.

its the trunk monster
Simon, Goat, the owner of the junkyard where Coop found MEGAS.
And Goat died the end

Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Spotlight Music: Chasing the Wind / Little Miss Rarity / Aloe & Lotus
aniderp|bestcakeever: Better question: Why are you wearing them?
i wanna steal my ex's boxers o.O
aniderp|bestcakeever: The real question is why you are telling strangers on the internet about stealing your brothers boxer-briefs
idk...
00,10and yes that is prime
aniderp|bestcakeever: Slow day, eh?
boxers are comfy and i thought they were boxers o.O
lol
but they boxer breifs
wait... cullen?
Robo-room 101?
Dat Prisoner reference
kill prime
and here is your clockwork isnt?
00,10yep
That's a really impractical switch.
but if i took my ex's boxers... i would have to wash them twice
00,10but it looks cool
and i doubt they would fit me o.O
nooo number 34353532 you were such a good robot
That won't work on Megas, considering it has no AI
megas ain't an AI :[
jcelios: Unfortunately they can't tell
hmmm dude you're messing with human brains now.... how does the program works in this case?
Waz: electricution\
it doesnt XD
00,10*facepalm*
lol
XD
what Coop said xD
hahahahahah
Best comeback ever
AI pyshics: how do you work
Maybe you should get out of it and show them it's a human piolted craft
No, I think Coop was right.
Intelligence Undetected.
lol
Intelligent undetected... including Kiva?
so.... robot rape time?
They always try to kill the person rather than letting them go, tsk tsk.

Java: Who is the real idiot. The idiot, or the one who follows him?
if she was smart she would have taken Megas back home LOOOOOOOONG ago
Fl00t4sh41: Well..... yeah
aniderp|bestcakeever: ok. good for you
the fluttershy one is funny XD
00,10wait they make those?
Jumpy-starty.
Quick and painless
they kill gundam! you bastard!
dont you just love cartoon death^^
00,10power saw
groovy
bumble bee will save the day
just wait
Java: Gundams are all shit anyway
Megas > Gundams
Fl00t4sh41: Now you take that words back sonny
00,10and he sticks the landing
Hmm, this show is 99% episodic. If this were adapted into a Super Robot Wars game, the writing would have to change into a full-on-continuity, fusing it with other mecha franchises that take itself at least a little bit more seriously, and the jokes about the malfunctions would be a lot harder to portray.
Java: Nope. Gundam Seed and Destiny ruined the whole franchise
Inb4 it doesn't hurt
Fl00t4sh41: You based the whole franchise on Seed series? avoid those crap and enjoy better ones.
More slide shows
00,10ohmy
Java: Because Gundam Wing and Gundam X where such massive improvements
oh. dear.... wait... wut?
no not MTV!
unf
im byack :3
and is this transformers?
No, jcelios, it's Poop TV on this show.
Fl00t4sh41: yes. It's an improvement.
guys
Java: But still shit
http://www.cafepress.com/+derpy_hooves_boxers,557530005
the derpy boxers look like that
im not sure if i want..
Fl00t4sh41: Nope, not shit
00,10the thong looks better
Hating on Gundam because of SEED while watching MEGAS XLR is like hating on all of Star Wars based on the prequels while watching Spaceballs.
202! <3
Is that purple guy supposed to be Zentraedi expy?
101! <3
Spicy ham nuggets.
Kandarihu: Point
gameoner
they male derpy thongs?
*make
Java, I don't see any Macross references i this.
Kandarihu: X
gaverover*
Kandarihu: XD
well... that failed
i can hear you guys thinking up remarks to that typo
Kandarihu: the purple guy? "lesser intelligence being" stuff?
no the flowers nooooo
Kandarihu: I'm more of a battletech/patlabor/ghost in the shell kind of guy
La-la-laaaa!
evil
I prefer my robots with just a hint of realism
Not a lot, just a little
The alien sounds like Optimus Prime.
but.. the thongs are for the girls right? o.O
What? No Konami code?
then stay the fork away from Gurren Lagann :P
Seems like a Konami Code to Me
aniderp|bestcakeever: they are for whoever can rock 'em!
Fl00t4sh41: which kicks gundams out of te contest and leaves pretty much only mechwarrior
up down triangle... damn
but thing is i need to know about the thong so i can order right size if i do get it o.O
Dark_Horst: Which is why I dislike gundam
well done Coop...
turns out it was a prison for evil robots
00,10cruse control, cruse out of control
Dark_Horst: that and the facepalminglly bad writing the series is rife with
Then it turns out Coop screwed over the universe
what DID he build?
...you freed a whole bunch on convicts
Cruisin' USA
'Cruise Out of Control'? XD
Tom Cruise control
bitches love world savers
Bet they were deadly convicts
Yep
ah crap
00,10Jammie just likes to watch the universe burn
Lalalalalaaa.
dat cruise OUT of control button.
i was right
Gurren Laggan gets a pass by actually being funny and entertaing
ohey that's Cam Clarke
well...
shit
DUN DUN DUN
I'm almost surprised.
Lalalaaa.
HAHAHA
Wut
SpeccyRush, ... oh, I guess you're right! He DOES sound like Liquid Snake!
hahahahahha
XD

a couple of fights :/
00,10this will be amusing when finished
define "a couple"
our entire existance is nothing but fighting!
we have had thousands of battles and have killed millions
Java: Equestria wouldn't have an army if they didn't get into fights themselves
i love anthropology <3

The 4th promo
because thats just a couple
:3
MECHA
oh that guy
Who's this guy?
Ohhhh.
Fl00t4sh41: Of course. But we go to war for less reasons.

The first GOOD one that is
You mean Dusk's Dawn wasn't good?
Java: We don't know the reasons why questria go to war
>_>
<_<
00,10well notice how he changed it slightly
Fl00t4sh41: Defense
00,10no longer saying the first
AND he's using it for his school? interesting
00,10but saying the first with a bunch of good things
Delaying episode 3...
00,10Supposedly he's been offered a job already when he graduates
While SMG13 project falling award, this one goes well.... I hope
Dat attack at Dusk's Dawn.

Deacon: early 2013, so the first 3 months of 2013
Sumica: well brag about it why don't you

It kills you
this will be interesting
woink
A different art style

Why do they have hand-drawn animation in there?
OH YEA
Simon: well, this is a collab

HUZZAH

i fucking hate that noise
penguin oh yea, and it's on the hub
Assuming strategy
with...very questionable content
fourth dimension chess! XD
jcelios: how?
I wish I can make that kind of strategy
Deacon: is dan a child or a full grown man?
Yeeeaaah, this guy is a dumbass.
HAHA
Simon: Dan said the dentist was playing fourth dimensional chess XD
penguin: both
penguin manchild would be fitting, but that would only compliment him
Deacon: so... he is a short people
I don't think he's a midget.
He's really short though
lol
Dan <3
Braviary1: i didn't say midget. thats politically correct
Chainsaw Bloodbath does sound like more fun
She sounds awesome. XD
You asked if he was a manchild, and you care about political correctness?
aaa.... so dan is gay
good for him
00,10suddnly sledge hammer
penguin: wat?
And you didn't think of this first?
jcelios: he doesn't like girls. therefore gay
lol, perfect logic
true facts
penguin: It's dan, he hates everyone :<
This isn't akward at all
see
no ask girls out
And yet he does nothing

Fl00t4sh41: sausage

Request: Gravity Falls!

rdibp: He did warn you :I

well, gonna open my last Malzbier :(
08,01question: if we asked for donations, how many of you would donate, and how much would you donate? (realisitically, please)
Sudden yellow appears.
This is ....rulewise Dan :D
05server costs
08,01for server upkeep on bronystate
05keepign the site polished
rdibp: He clearly said knock it off :I
05etc
If I had money... about $10
pitching license
Actually Dan fit perfectly in Baseball....
08,01it costs us $60/year for hosting, etc.
hm... about 20$
Depends if it were an internet ad it would probably be a scam
I would give about....50 a year?
I'm surprised it's that low, to be honest. :S
Probably 5 bucks
MLP_Brovakiin: i though i said it. :T
Consdiering I'm on it almost ever day, I'd feel bad not donating anything...
LOL
AHAHAHAHA
wait we can donate all of a sudden now?
I have been barking up that tree being told no.
:D Genious
00,10it's being thought about Barbetos
Boom
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: "Spike at your Service": Episode Followup
i love these
LOL
Aight. well let me know. I would love to help
I sleep on a big pile of muuneeh!
MilkyWhiskers00 Okay Mr. Crabs
Dan better stay away from Disney World then
08,01would it be more reasonable for us to offer commissions from our artists, rather than ask for donations?
00,10BUNS!
Barbetos: It was in the show - .-
Lawl dat imunity
hahahahaha
LOL
xD
08,01like $15 for a sketch from wrek
05ahem
MACED
05im more expensive than that boy
AHAHAHAHHA
DAT KIDNAPP!
08,01i'm just floating the idea!
lol
08,01it was an example
Wrek: could be just a quick draw...
Monkeyface tape his arms!
Lol
Might want to talk about this on skype? =X
15 bucks for a sketch?
Duct tape fixes everything
Me too buddy
08,01Wrek: i can name some things you'd do fro free.
Some one may be a dick about it if you throw numbers around here, and change them later.
^
^^
05cause i want to do them
monkey face will be jail bait. just like luna
05if i gotta follow someones prerequisites
08,01okay, who thinks it should be the mods' responsibility to contribbute to the server costs?
Not me
We're a group
We live by group
Nah, we all use it, it is a shared effort :)
We fight for group
Welllllll...
they already donate time and effort moderating imo
It is privately owned
08,01oh cool, we have an army
Deef trawp
WAit
I want a hot dog now.
Just make sure no one can throw this place under the bus by making it "everyones"
DEATH TRAP!
i am hungry now
I want to contribute, but i want the mods in controll
08,01Lil_B: i'm not sure how many would *actually* donate if we did it, though
i want hot dogs
05donatiosn would fund server costs keepign the site polished and my cigarretes
Cuase you guys seem to knwo what your doing, and care to od the right thing.
Wrek: hooray for smokes
6So whats up?
I would pay for Wrek smokes
Ima donate cigars to the wrek fund now.
Well, the idea for paid art commission sounds good.
Cigars makes brandy, coffee, whiskey, soda...
Water proof
08,01our current webhost is not the cheapest, but they do give us the best terms, w.r.t. DMCA
Better idea: Make Bronystate Gold a reality. XD
All those things taste amazing after a cigar.
Lol
Dat
Fight
08,01so if we get a DMCA notice from Hasbro, they can get stuck at our webhost
I already have bronystate gold, I can see what you said GilDash XD

Vordox, indeed. But anyone who doesn't please the far left will get the same kind of character assassination that Mitt Romney did.
its just one paragraph
Didn't someone tell you not to impersonate people?
http://imgur.com/mtxM8
but stretched out
Impersonate? Watcha mean?
penguin: There is no denying your logic. Jesus does indeed, hate puppies.
And believe me. It would've happened to Ron Paul if he got the GOP nomination.

I think Air didn't have Lyrics :P
that shinji has a terrible voice actor oO
hey i think i saw derpy
13the dub is just a liiiiittle off in a lot of places
there right there derp
Shizuka: other than that, is it pretty good?
Sumica: Maybe they make the members pay for it at the NerV bookstore, gotta fund it somehow
Sumica what is this film called ?
derpy
penguin: I guess everything produces a sound but as singing is classed as produced by a living organism an inanimate object cannot unless personnified in description?
dat flank
Damn that sexy
Rocket: evangelion rebuilds 1.11
00,10rebuild of eva: 1.11 you are (not) alone
God bless you Bronysith
Shizuka: "Little off" "a lot of places" <-- Woot
Poppycock

pot80: nah in disney movies rocks can sing. therefore your logic is invalid
Sumica i have to watch it >w<

Bronysith Do you like stuff about the mafia
that text is beautiful
yay
00,10the most advance weapon> uses an extention cord to power it
13thx ^^
Why does hurting the machine also hurt the person controlling it?
penguin: but they are created in a personnified manner so all it does is back up my argument
so wait, they will put gozilla VS gozilla ?
Sumica: Ikr
Sumica: We got to start from SSSOMEWHERE

Yes son this will be you at the end of every mission
What's that anime?
1 thing i like better in the original anime is when the eva lifts its hand over shinji from the falling rocks
penguin: that has nothing to do with how inanimate objects can sing when presented in a personnified manner though which is what we were talking about
its just a giant alien monster
now thats the spirit
Have you accepted Scootaloo as your personal lord and savior
00,10needs more thuderbirds are go music
I'm sure he's in the perfect mental state to fight.
pot80: it has everything to do with "fox and the hound" that was a great movie
So about that EVA practice so he can move

shinji is a trap
Rei Shinji and...?
I'm gonna go to sleep. Good night everybody
bobbies
Shizuka - i thought it was a suffix for "young"
ASS AND TITTIES
I see, so it would be a terrible loss if they left that out of the movie. I wonder if it happens in the 3rd movie, too?
seeya Simon, have a nice rest
...
hi
Shizuka: Wrong, chan is a very affinity suffix
ugh
Record_Discord: really? :D
SHUT UP SHINJI
hi
pot80: Oh yah
13yes but more frequently for girls
Don't forget: you're here forever
Yeah, it's often assosciated to girls names

Kun, Chan, Don, Doro...

What other suffixes are there...

Reminds me of the Luxor.
By the way, they are called honorifics.

(Fullr respectful elder) :D
Vordox-dono
00,10altho I bet there is a shit ton of shoes at the botom of that shaft
Hedgehogs?
Shizuka: because there's always nasty crab-like aliens falling down in them?
EXCEPT FOR SONIC
13that too
Sumi why do you say that?
13or demons from hell
Like shoe prints?
13or portal goo
right
13but mostly because they're horribly disorienting
that explains why sonic always runs away from amy

<---- SERIUOSLY HUMANITY
PENETRATED
WHY ARE YOU IDIOTS; FUCK MONEY AND SHIT WHEN HUMANITY IS DYING, RETARDED STORIES
where the fuck did they get all the damn metal for that shit?
Vordox: in the script
Dark_Horst Fuck logic :D
Ma'am throwing paper at the enemy is not only childish, but it would never work.
do they have, like, cows that crap ore?
13Vordox: well, it'd be like draining every penny from the US economy to pay off the debt, you could do it once but then you've destroyed everything you need to do it again
00,10I liked it beter in the show where they just have rei take the gun after she rips the roof off the building
Shizuka: If money comes before humanity, I say fuck humanity
they assemble the evangelions of harmony
Charge the Ion Cannon!
a few favors?
they have ION CANNON ?
good guy money can solve all problems...but scumbag money causes all problems
That amount to HOW MUCH MONEY!?
Dark_Horst: It's japan so I would expect anything
KnightLunaire: My little Gurren Laggan
00,10yes they have an ion cannon
She must be one high priced... nevermind.
13they should use tiberium
But without the pennies, how would we pay to make more pennies?
Shizuka: I wonder how CC is doing...
Record_Discord, for that nge would need more bewbs
Shizuka exactly!
Why is Rei all the sudden interested?
TELL ME SHOW
Well it's midnight you'' all be asleep anyways...except for the people out getting drunk all night that sucks for them
and it sings a happy tune
Barbetos: this show has problem with pacing
Barbetos: Girls in shows always do that kind of thing
00,10wistle while you work Dark_Horst
pot80 oh yeah.. thats right. Tenchi Muyo syndrome I calls it
00,10he Shizuka, thing they will have asuka in the D suit again?
13dunno
Except Tenchi was cooler than Shinji
00,10that would be silly
sooooo...
Barbetos: I just call it lazy steriotyping :D
pot80: Archtypes
Does the kid have 9 lives or something?
gawd, more monologues

08,01who here likes Savage Garden?

Aaaahhh I'm being bombarded with technical terms I don't know :O
00,10Vordox, 1230pm
13shinji has sleep apnea i think
08,01pot80: Saveage Garden is not a technical term
Sumica, If your tired then stop dancing on my screen.
13he keeps waking up gasping
Sumica: ...Does that exist...?
08,01Tie: *you're

I don't have Savage Garden, so no I haven't
Then everyone hated Shinji
Sumica: doesnt really tell me anything
YOU'RE IN TWILIGHT SUMICA?!
KnightLunaire: if you panic you cant get shit done
08,01Tie: #firstworldanarchy
meal in a drawer. Nice.
00,10Dark_Horst, it's an inflation suit, auska pulls a willywonka
08,01MadSurge: i'm good!
Sumica: :D
13rei uses guilt trip
...wat?
13it's... super effective
Shizuka: extremely super duper effective T~T

13shinji is weak against guilt type pokemon
rulebreaker
08,01:P
Sumica: she's still not purple :D
Sumica: i have no idea what willy wonka has to do with it, but i just googled it anyway^^
I hate it when the family fights =(

I guess we can't have an abridging of anything of Evangelion without going there. But I kind of felt it was handled a bit more tastefully than LittleKuriboh's version.
again again again
ok, I'm away, playing Castle Crashers, btw we need a 4th Guy, if anyone is interrested, pm me :)
KnightLunaire: On YouTube of course
Lil_B: you playing my bro's game. Sweet.

And the pony dances to nothing. Which makes perfect sense for Evangelion.
:D
sometimes I wonder if this here rly is a gathering of bronies

Her name is Mari
:P
glasses girl?
Lol
Kandarihu: false, it is mistress sexy
oh my...
13i like that even though mari is so psychotic in rebuild 2, she's useless in 3
Bronysith, XD
asuka in a nutshell
board games have a tendency to piss people off
Shizuka: youve seen 3?
Try playing Mario Party
<--- How to introduce a character. :D
13no but the preview of it
I love Mario Party
That game ruins families and destroys friendships
is it even released yet?
05aaand im free for the rest of the night
Shizuka: So what is Mari...connection to the children?
00,10she comes across as more casual then useles.
05finally
adults seem to have the worst plans ever in this anmie
I went out with my sister and best friend last night for kind of a bachelorette party
Misato's voice actor?
it was pretty awesome
Ohai Wrek :P
girls in a nutshell or nut in a girlshell ?
but that friend has Mario party
and we used to always play it

No thank you

Oh my god yea, that's exactly what I got
00,10eyes on the road misato
I would be even more afraid of r/apple and r/android
haha
Sumica: Yeah it's a heavy traffic
Actually /r/apple and /r/android are not that bad
00,10the road curves
you gotta belieeeeeve
really?
Every time shinji says anything I become more of an angry person
00,10and well that
inb4 cum jokes
13oops
It's /r/technology that you need to watch out for
LOL
13dropped that
You've got the BELIEVE.
I would think they'd both be extremely circlejerky
13useless angel is go
Does he NEED to repeat that????
Yea, /r/apple and /r/android are actually void of most fanboys
00,10better then the undersea one Shizuka
talk about heavy traffic
inb4 shizu arrivfes
hmm
13i mean really the angels show they learn from previous failures, wtf is this one supposed to accomplish
interesting
wat
this thing looks even more stupid
13okay it does that
Well, it made things explode.
it was reincarnated into a crappy jesus clock
13release the shizu~
Asuka \:3/
asuka to the rescue
00,10cool gun is cool
you forgot your gun
Asuka!!!
so why is the ocean filled with red drink anyways?
oh hai Shizuka you going to kick some angel ass?
But no one is interested in that :P
Sunddy Just Cause 2 eva unit
How to jailbreak, mods, consumer advice, etc.
So... is asuka still hormonal in this one?
<--- Who piloting that?
uhm, why's the sea red?
crush it with your constant menstruation powers
so many tentacles.....
Now this is what I'm talkin about
While /r/android is the same thing, except with android.
Obligatoru Guitar
13still a pointless angel
still cant touch that
shoot the glowing testicle maybe?
00,10izuma kicka
Shizuka, ikr
Kicking an Angel...?
that's good
Shizuka but now in 3d!
looks kind of painful
Yes, do flips in the air for speed and power.
ROUNDHOUSE KICK
13momentum
yeah, put that core in the line of fire, for all to see
13how does it work
I never thought I'd see that kind of maturity from reddit

SPLOOOOOOOOOOGE
LMAO
damn. Strong jets
And ded
13what
nice one Asuka
OH myyyyyyyyyyyy
Did shinji die?
so, that was fast
please tell me he died
But they never get very heated
Barbetos, sorry.
no shinji didn't die
nuuuuuuuuuhh!1
but he needs new shorts
Shizuka: "Son of a bitch, GRRRR!"
I would think
these girls kick enough ass, why do they need shinji at all
13it's also not the only thing that's red
ohpleasetellmehe'sded-noooooo
Eww.... red.
/r/trees is the least arguing
ASUKA <3
Hell, people even post their shitty artwork there, and they don't get chewed out.
They're too high to argue
red wunz go fasta
http://imgur.com/2K2Xw Shizuka has arrived
Its true. I did not believe it, but Asuka does make this so much better.
asuka rocks
like today I saw one where people were arguing if the new animation style (which I never even noticed) was a sign of declining quality in the show
http://imgur.com/HPh7e hello asuka
she has the best death in the first movie
YES HE'S STUPID
You mean like the odd angles?
I do not like Asuka
goddamn i hate this bitch
Yeah
She's too perky
please forgive me mistress :<
Vordox nobody does
I saw some screenshots and I agree they look pretty odd
ekips: Shizuka loves her
Asuka is a bitch
but I don't really notice that while I'm watching the show
^
I would never hide behind my daddy in front of you
Shizuka is...an exception
"We are just undestructable angels but we showing this red thing just waiting you to destroy it"
And people were saying the show is dying because of that
srsly?
Its not something that concerns me.
I need an adult!
everyone hits on shinji
EVERYONE
Yeah, the MLP fandom gets worked up over silly things
speaking of which mlp is on in 4 minutes...
No wonder his father hates him
even the angels
Shinji gets all the bitches
00,10shinji is a tri sexual.
08,01btw, i've found the BEST cover of Paint It Black
O_o tri sexual?
well geometry did a pretty decent job
00,10evey one wants to try dat ass
It's like they think every little bad thing is going to destroy the show
XD
he's omnipisexual
13it's marcellus wallace's briefcase
Sumica: WHAT'S THE THIRD SEX THEN? :D Hermaphrodite?
i put my drink down just in time Mica =P
you mean omni-sexual, Sundaysmile.
00,10they stole morphious's ship?
no
Okay
damn thieves
My biggest concern is if that screenshot of that person who says she works on the show is correct, where they are going to have twi go full alicorn and stay that way and continue the series like that.
08,01Vordox: listen to the Tyep O Negative cover
Sexual Tension go
Dat grope.
quistis has a bf?
BAD TOUCH
What does that even mean?
whoa there
I mean a cross between omnipotent and willing to fuck everythign

Old times is a threesome

Shizuka: Well, technically, she's not from Germany...
...she doesnt sell 9t
00,10the magical land of germany
*it
just makes it easier to sex
Shizuka: But that's non-canon bleh
no it was 9
so is this show promoting that germans are bitch?
according to wikipedia
LOL
13ew noncanon
"Keep Calm and Flutter On"

Well...
Depends on how you think it is
I have no idea what they are talking about

13not a symbolic filtration pattern at all
fuck athmosphere

Vordox: TEL'POR'

they did 13 because kids like reruns so they could spend less money on new content.

08,01so, who here agrees with me that Matt Bellamy = sploosh?
it was a continuous story
13jcelios: lots and lots and lots of blood
Ever seen "The Andromeda Strain"?
mlp isn't a continuous story, but it ties in past events.
