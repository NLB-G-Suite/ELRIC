02The only time I’m okay with piracy is if I’ve already bought a previous version of it before
11,01Thrackerzod: I can't understand you with that thick communist accent of yours.
SWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET

Suuuuuusan?
03it's essentially worth nothing
"Oh, now you're doing it on purpose"
its legit, but against the EULA
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wFCwuTiwAo Rainbow Dash Fightiing is Magic Theme! (sadly, only a clip):)
03yeah screw the EULA
03it says it's legit for personal use
03:P
therefore, unethical or illegal
03dude how is it unethical
I never demanded a stream.
03I'm not going to use all 30 serials myself
there is ONE 10 hour challenge
11,01Maid hour is over, but I don't want to quit.

Seriously peeps, don't imply things.
Yo no hablo ingles

That does suck.
03what about an instrumental?>
izotope, autotune, and melodyne have done that for ages
dat kick
HA
WOW that was nuts
03can it find the pitch of an instrumental
The you-know-what?
how many instruments are in the instrumental?
a kick in tha head?
power abuse is always fun
Just finished the fifth book in Harry Potter
Hmm...
HEY GAIZ
03no idea.
Power abuse is best abuse
03with computerized beats
And this is why having... *counts* Eleven admins in one chatroom is a bad plan.
hehe...
.....Goddammit Saxy >___<

/me wubs everypony <3
05typical thigns to avoid: <Lawlz> Da fuck is this? #1
03EW VERSION WHORING
Also, a word of warning to all: If there arent ponies on the stream, and VAL is streaming...DO NOT COMPLAIN FOR THEM TO BE ON THE STREAM.
Next time we drink Cider.
Pinkie is cuter than Fluttershy imo
?
/me Doesn't like people, at all.
Hey
I can I get some help?
Next time, I eat paper
Where is a good place to post pony fanfics?
would you rather everyrthing stay at version 0.9999999999999999999999999?
Nothing can beat fluttershy cuteness
02EW CS6
inb4 yes
I pretty much hate everyone until I get to know them, only because I could care less about the,.
02I'll be keeping CS5
03I have CS5.5 right now

03yay artificial idiocy
me and my constant typos
Can I get some help here?
2,14 I figure tonight's stream needs to be especially awesome, since today is my last day before I start work
Most people I know hate me except my squad and my group of friends. Other than that....:P
6CS4 was awful
02^
6people either have CS3 or 5
RAGGLEFRAGGLE!
Val where are you working at?
03why not just make a revision?
11,01ValtheJean: Congrats on getting a job.
034, 5, 6, 7, 8 were basically the exact same thing
03then 9 added added crap
:3 thats great Val!!!
0310 was the same as 9
Not really
03and then 11 and 12 are the same?
03AFAIK
I cant be a douchebag sadly.... Its just not in my nature :\
03my point being
Nuuuuuuuuuuuu
03remember the 2.0s?
This is like
03it was 2.0.0.16, 2.0.0.18, 2.0.0.20 etc
2,14 and it isn't really *found* work, as I've worked here every summer for like...5 years
0,14Val working The Man, I see
Do you want me to go find the src control system checkin log
03none of this jumping whole numbers crap
I can't be a douchebag, I never was.
......
It's my experience that "He's a douchebag." is a safer assumption than "He's a respectable guy."
0,14*working for
Do i need to quote myself?
/me is a doormat :(
Sigh...so much for any help
...that carries a different set of problems.
I'm not mean to anyone unless they give me a reason to:P
Someone insults me? I just shrug my shoulders and keep wwalkin :D
its ok, have a hug
/me hugs back
/me sighs.
02I do have to agree with drf
i need to stop being sad
Then why did I get a #1?
I just can't do it. I usually end up crying if someone says somethign bad to me...
0,14We recognize pony rights

Without the browser "wars" we would still be using IE6
I copies you whens I wants!
05but then again, usign demeaning terms against someone without a cause seem redundant to me. in the sentence of direct accusation and not generalization.
My little copies: STOPS COPIES ME!

The shit is bananas. B-a-n-ana-a-s
00,10check imdb and roten tomatoes
thx
rotten tomatoes sucks
I cannot permit anyone to eat my brain.
they gave biebers movie a higher score than one of the Star Wars
I am sorry.
00,10high budget and or high rateings is an A
I am not a scared little child!
/me runs away.
/me continues running far far away.
on imdb it got like a 2
00,10Yeah the people paied to give oppinions dont sit well
i think rottentomatoes critics either got paid to do it, or they did it to show how "objective" they are
http://derpy.me/oXM99
xd
hey where do u guys go to check movie ratings
xd
That's a blow to the heart.
00,10not sure
00,10never needed to look
the movie i picked was a 7.4 rating and had a 5.5 million budget
Star Wars 1: 57-62 ratings; fagboy the movie: 64-65 ratings. BULL-SHIT
http://derpy.me/KOd-a
heres somethign happier
although after that the Luna thread I was browsing goes into nsfw territory
http://shwiggityshwah.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d4e0th5
top critics gave SW 38- fagboy the movie got 58
4chan.org is happier?
no matter how relatively bad SW 1 was compared to other parts, its never worse than a movie about fagboy
both images were from 4chan
which is why rottentomatoes suck
*text
huh
but the first one didnt... thats weird
WAZZAAAAAAAAAAP
13thing is, rotten tomatoes uses actual critics to score the movies
Yeah, I could see the first one.
13which makes them more reliable than IMDB's user-only ratings
YO GUYS PICK UP THE PHONE
But the last one, I can't.
alright brb
I have no answers.
me either
SW1 cant be that much worse than fagboy movie
00,10would not be the first subed movie we have done
cool
real critics are jsut as biased as ordinary viewers
i bet they either got payed, or they did it to look "objective"
:)
its called lissi und der wilde kaiser
13oof
/me hugs twilight _sprinkle
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
13that's why i don't use user ratings in the backlog when i can avoid it
i think rottentomatoes just got paid, the audience ratings cant be that different whhen we're talking about bieber
Gonna grab something to eat, be right back.
