Bieber's a Brony. Atleast he has ONE good quality
oh nvm
dat line was pretty good
StinkomanFan, he still sucks
nittany_discord i summoned the main 6 in the front seats, and a viewer up here.
StinkomanFan: actually that istn good at all
StinkomanFan: great, now he's a brony.
IRL shed be sobbing and begging for release
StinkomanFan: what....
StinkomanFan I'm not sure if I should be proud of that
gahh... then everyone will think bronies are girly
StinkomanFan: uhh, here we go again...
oh god.......... he got minced AND froze....AAAWESOOOOOME!
Bieber is a brony...... were f--ked....
Fluttershy: *having a slight* case of vertigo*
StinkomanFan: i thin k its a act to get more fans
StinkomanFan: The twittermessage?
what if he gets on bronystate StinkomanFan
StinkomanFan: I thought that pic was proven to be fake.
fluttershy:sqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqueeeeeeeeeeee
owloysius would that be better, or worse than what they think of us now?
It isnt at least on his twitter anymore
RaveBrony: he tweeted it. saw a screnshot. today is truly a dark day for us
Man, with a truck that big, he could take out, like, 8 Helicorptors.
he's a brony. Should I care?
Dken2021: not sure. We don
Dark_Horst: Damn it......
Alchemist, I am neutral to this development
't need his fans becoming pegasisters
Rainbowdash: Yah, that griffon is so dead
Although Lady Gaga's still a brony
Obsidian he's Canadian and I don't give a buck
Rarity: OH SHE DID NOT!
zhe last thing this fandom needs is beliebers
StinkomanFan: I dont care wheter it is fake or not, just saying.
HIT HIM AGAIN!
bullet to the knee?
Canadian_Brony: My thoughts exactly
and then RAMMED
Dark_Horst i know. they would just do it for the Beiber
oh shit
he pissed
and he gonna fuk u up!
Twilightsparkle: they fail, don't they? This is a action movie with a happy ending type.
"omg raneboe dsh is sew cule"!!!!1!!!111
Not the knee

Wait... is this the Die Hard with the truck vs. Chopper?
Did I miss that scene?!! :D

PinkiePieYoshi64: eeyup

NOW YOU HAVE FUCKED UP
i used to be ok with biebs until his new songs came out
oops, i forgot to fuck up my grammar
PinkiePieYoshi64: better. Truck vs MILITARY TEST PLANE
Rainbowdash: Damn Celestia, Twilight, stop spoiling everything with your egghead nonsense
C'MON FREDY!

Thrackerzod: Can we CARE less, pls?
C'mon Wizard...Warlock...Druid, whatever
Thrackerzod we can but we dont want to
again....
just read that season 3 will be 13 episodes...
Dark_Horst don't complain about their likes. In my eyes, it's just as bad as being a hater. Keep your bitching to yourself (and this is coming from a hater of Justin Beiber)
Alchemist: yup
shacky
Alchemist: only 13?
Golf Tango 5 Niner 2 November.
Thrackerzod: Saddly, it is the one thing they refuse to do, most likley due to the obnxious fanbase
SirGanjalf: seems like.
Here we go again....lol
Alister: Where?
Funfact: There has been no actual sign that Bieber's a brony. Calm thine tits.
Petrified_Discord: EQD
Petrified_Discord: wat ?
Alister: nm wrong ping
RAWRity thank god
00,10so this is how tonights going to be.

...Whoa mama.
/me grabs Petrified_Discord raft
o_o
00,10well he's fucked

00,10oi, where the hell are you going
Seeing as M A Larson, one of the show's writers, was WRITING AN EPISODE a few weeks ago, I'm fairly certain the show's still in production.
becasue that part of the place wouldnt be hot at all
Hello ShadowStep

Sucks to be you McClaneeeeeeeeeeee....

BLUE AND ORANGE EVRYWHERE!
lol, sumica.. get out
BLUE AND TEAL!
Good question, will the plane or that highway cost more to replace?
Look how BROWN this movie is!
Pistol mode activate
ORANGE AND TEAL!
sagas: Portals?
the plae
the plane
It's like COD the movie!
he's not nearly bloody enough for all the shit he went through at this point
SirGanjalf: overused color scheme
StrayPony highway. That needs to be replased ASAP
~yay~~
excepted this is entertaing unlike cod
^^
StinkomanFan: In that he can get shot and be fine after a little rest XD
Dark_Horst: He has his blood replaced with pissed-offedness.
SO MUCH ORANGE AND TEAL HUES!
Thrackerzod: they may have decided it would be more profitable to work on a 13-ep air schedule, or they may have something else in production. Maybe more episodes to be aired during the spring-summer next year. Maybe a movie. Maybe the episodes will be an hour long. WHO KNOWS? CLEARLY NOT US.
The goggles they do nothing...
Dance, man! Dance!
bullet to the knee
Ouch
Thrackerzod: First CoD's were entertaining
inb4 knee jokes
oww...
carful, that's his hacking shin
sagas: complementary color scheme?
THIS IS LIKE TRANSFORMERS!
@ Spriggals LOL
the rules never change..
RAWRity I like the hour-long episode idea
Except better.

SirGanjalf yes but this isnt ww2

NOOOOOOOOO he ded
00,10dat same trick

I think a real man would have died 5 times by now
sagas: not just in movies. I think its a kind of a protocol to make the stuff more appealing to the eye.
PinkiePieYoshi64: That's Sumica's OC, and she likes to dance
PinkiePieYoshi64 that's Sumica's OC, bro. Take a wild guess
Damn
Denied.
11,01Just fire the gun.

I've had a real beef against a lot of western animation in that it seems to move character's bodies all the time for the sake of moving the character's bodies all the time. Disney's been a major offender.
Dken2021: I got a Samsung Galaxy Tab and 50 bucks
lol :D

29 years ago... a wednesday?
PFFFFFFFFYTTT
0,14foot meet mouth
What I prefer to see is every body movement in animation is driven by purpose of some kind.
Specically, he was the director of "Digimon: Our War Game", in which an evil Virus Digimon attempted to destroy the planet by taking out communication lines and then hacking into a secret missle base and firing off dozens of armed nukes.

00,10what are you talking about wrek?

Liokin: well have a nice day then and JUST IGNORE ME THEN.
OVER 9000
05anyways
I'm stille peeved I cant take out liqour from a restuaraunt, they dont trust anybody to have liqour in an "opened container" in their car :|
RAWRity: WAIT really? im 14 fuck yeaaaaaaah
FUCKING KILL HIM
Wrek: hell, japan has an age of consent at 15
otakon: Cause im not easily irritated. So you had to have done something bad.
Wait, what's the age of consent in Sweden again Wrek?
though I believe they have at 13 for males.
NO
i have some machinery i would like to show you
because japan's also rather sexist.
RAWRity: IM 14 AND IM MEXICAN WOOOHO
Liokin: or maybe you're imagining things since I barely know you and I've been a regular here for months.
look at the money i made
05age of consent 15. buying beer at the local store and tobacco products 18. harder liquers at the state own alcohol supplier 20
slapped
BRIBERY
otakon: Tell ya' what appologize and ill let it go
HECH YEAH!
HACK ALL THE SHIT
00,10wait you have levels of drinking wrek?
otakon: doesnt matter what for
Wrek: that's what it's like for a lot of places here, save all alcohol is 21.
O_O
HOLY SHIT
look out, she's got a spear
oops
XD
All it takes, in some places around here, for something to be considered a closed contatiner - is to have the straw wrapper over the top end of the straw - but I still cant order a margarita to go
YESSSSSSSS
Well ok then.
oh shit, grannys pissed
otakon: Just say I appologize for stepping on your foot and ill let it go
Granny LIKE A BOSS
Granny mad
SUPER GRANNY
Liokin: for what though? If I screwed up something I assure you it wasn't intentional.
00,10as I said, bad ass granny
AW SHIT RUN
ooo-eeee-oooooh Killa' Granny.
eeyup, definately my economics teacher
Wrek: HA! we're 2 years ahead of you guys with booze!
Drinking age in aus is 18 and sex age I think is 16. Not 100% positive.
GO GO POWER RANGERS
0,14grandma's got nagata skills
WTF
0,5Liokin what the hell's going on
05Dark_Horst: maybe but whats the german distribution system like?
11,01*gasp*
0,5Are you starting trouble?
Liokin: I'm sorry for stepping on your foot.
BaconMane: I cant remember -lawl
I dont fully understand, why exactly is she angry?
BaconMane: but I hate otakon for something. I cant quite remmebr though...
i am now a jello
BaconMane: My memory is shot >.>
TheHoodyNinja: her half son just made a heap of trouble for Japan for money.
0,5I'm sure it's quite the story. Quit bugging him.
*gasp* SHES BAREFOOT IN JAPN!
otakon: okay then
LEAVE NATSUKI ALONE!!!
forshame
TheRandomkid321: FUCKING CRIME
Wrek: you're allowed to buy beer with 16 and hard liquor with 18. if that'S what you mean
why is it always the us's fault ?
woo, summer wars
TheHoodyNinja: It is because she loves her uncle
i'll be wiating for you upstairs.
what is this anume called?
BaconMane: Fine tell him to fuck off then >:3
Yeah that answer'll help.
BaconMane: oh he wasn't bugging me, but it did put me off when he said "Don't talk to me, I hate you" after I responded to him.
Welp that does it I'm moving to Poland appearently there is a village called Brony there.
this isn't cool enough. you should play it in the shadow realm
CapTaIn_MasterBoss43: not my question but ok
i dont undterstand anything of what happening :3
what are they playing?
05you see. here the local stores can sell beer cinder n shit to the max of i think 3,5% alchohol. higher than that you have to go to the state owned alcohol distributor which keeps a hig hquality sortiment that is very broad from varying price groups. you are also able to special order that special schech beer if you want aswell.
Dov: really?
otakon: I guess so going to look it up now
KOIKOIKOIKOIKOIKOIKOIKOIKOIKOI
3.5%? You wimps
shuddup: I think its japanesse poker
Dov: yeah and theres a equestria in africa
0,5Liokin, how about you quit freaking out, eh? Otakon clearly hasn't done anything.
oh Koi
CapTaIn_MasterBoss43: You mean love in a platonic way or......
oh okay
We should enjoy the movie, not talk about age limits
BaconMane: omg! thats what it was!
cachi01: what...
Wrek: everybody sells everything
BaconMane: I hat eit when ponys say "EH"
BaconMane: well apparently I've done something, although I would like to rectify that if I can.
05then again we can drink our asses off at pups and bars unrestriced at 18
TheHoodyNinja: she trusted him, that is why she's angry
Dov: equestria s an african country
BaconMane: As in why dont you blank "EH"
A fight?
Holy celestia!
I return to Wrek talking about alcohol and Koi on the stream!! I <3 Bronystate! :D
AttacktheAndalite: Love as a family.
05then again everyoen already does at the age of 14 15
FIRE THE FRIENDSHIP CANNON
Liokin: that is it? You hate me for saying "eh" on chat? What are you a grammar nazi?"
what?
0,5Too bad, I'll say "Eh" whenever I like. Is that a problem with you?
BaconMane: Thats just anal to me >.>
In US its 18 to smoke, but 21 to drink - but 18 to join the military - I say, If you join the military to serve, you should be allowed to drink - in case of war, some wont last 3 years
i like it oral

RAWRity 11th one looks weird in a fez

Ok, I missed the explanation to that last part...

Sumica: yes please!
Pudge: Well, noteverypony gets thye HUB.
Sumica SHOW
NOW
7/10 for me. Good, enjoyable movie. But it gets a bit unfocuse in the first act, with trying to establish the plot while also introducing us to the large family. The main character sort of becomes side-lined during the second act, and overall it just has problem keeping everything feeling tonally consistent.
otakon: He's going to bed. It's 5:22am for him
sumica, boogiepop phantom?
Kencolt: I meant on BMN

it's swimming, not flying
00,02RAWRity, thats been in the works for a while now
did it ever occur to any of the crew of the nautilus to call upon the Seaponies?
Phase4: but they announced the price now.
Fishy!
00,02huh
RainRunner um that works better so yes
13gfiber is still not due to start construction til next year, but they just made time warner blow a few gaskets
13i am sure kansas city folk pay more to TWC to get less than what google's offering
Whats gfiber
Shizuka: damn sure.
A GIANT SQEED!
Could this be any worse? OF COURSE IT CAN
03 so, yeah, I'll be streaming that some time soon. Poirot is awesome, and an anime would just be silly, so I think it will be fun.
and twc would just lower the price in that city
like gmail but with optic fibre
BALOONS!
IDK.
03 good good, then
GarrettBrony: basically, google's setting up the tech to have their own, CHEAP AS FUCK internet services.
RainRunner Baloons? do they float?
:O
RAWRity: Cheap as it sucks or cheap as in it wont cost much
00,02wait
DAT PEDOPHILE!
00,02google is offering FREE internet
GarrettBrony: They all float. :)
00,02free after a fee of course
Phase4: no
13lowfn: cheap as in 5/1 free, or 1000/1000 for $70 a month
tentacle rape
00,02but free after that
lowfn: cheap as in 30 dollars for better service than any ISP company out there
Agaiiinsst it
13$300 installation fee since they're laying the fiber themselves, its far and away better than every other isp in the country
Horray for google!
and then Comcast shit their intestines out.
Uay I'm switching to google then
RainRunner BALLOONS? do they float?
§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§
*Yay
08,01i'm off to bed
08,01night all
Dat pedophile!
13not really, kansas city is time warner cable controlled
♀ + ♀
13comcast probably doesn't operate there
let's cook that sucker!!!
GarrettBrony: They do Georgy.
on a side note, many companies formed a consortium to lay underwater fiber to south asia, because internet was patchy
13comcast will surely drop a few bricks once google starts looking at other cities
RainRunner Can I float too?
Because the only way people would put up with higher prices would be if they had good service. And comcast....they treat service like helping somebody makes their urethra invert.
And now, a take from STar Trek.
13twin cities is comcast country, no other provider can come lay cable up here
I hate that crap ^
Shizuka thats why japan is awesome
my electric company is like that
I knew Comcast was fishy
GarrettBrony: Only if you come down here, theres ride and all sorts of suprises down here! And balloons too.
They aren't going to die btw.
It reference
Indeed.
lowfn: wait until something breaks. Then...you'll get to deal with ISP tech support.
they wont let any one else lay line down here, so we have to put up with their crap (like double charging almost all the time) or move
RainRunner are you sure you are not just a spider disguised as a Tim Curry Clown?
Kalimari for all!
13see at least electric company makes sense... sort of... power, water, sewage, those are common lines, you can't say "this volt came from the plant by the river, that volt came from mars"
why amd drivers must be such a pain to install ...
RainRunner, what about the Giant stompy Monsters and or Robots?
and that's like saying you get to deal with a liqoured-up sailor to help you learn how to drive a car.
You don't say?
THEY ALL FLOAT DOWN HERE!
lowfn: >texas
>non shit
13telcos were classed common carriers because AT&T had such an iron grip on infrastructure it was choking business
>bahahahahahaha
And you'll float too!
I'm in oklahoma. It sucks here
00,02internet is not friendly here
00,02but there are laws to prevent monopolys
Alpha-Omega where the winds comes sweeping down the planes
00,02somewhat
00,02telstra finds sneaky ways around it sometimes
I've got TWC here. It is poop.
Alpha-Omega: Be happy your not in Kansas that place was a shithole last time I drove through it.
13course once ma bell was forced to break up, the regional carriers were forced to house startups at cost.. thus why cable shot up for high speed internet
I am in Nebraska ATC Communication does our internet
It is poop on top of a pile of vomit.
13as of yet, cable companies aren't classed as common carriers
13that needs to change and fast
00,02theres more than one documented case of them giving exchange space to a uni, then telling other providers the excange is full
Don't get the reference. I was born in california but moved to oklahoma
I'm in Canada eh.
11,02Dat tunnel
Alpha-Omega its from Oklahoma the musical . Look it up
I just love that Google's just been buying up dark fiber for like...years on end, without telling anybody.
13thing is when a comcast lobbyist gets appointed chair of the FCC, the outlook isn't fantastic
RainRunner but I thought you lived in Derry Maine
Well it's about oklahoma. So maybe when Imove back to california
Plus I don't like plays. I prefer books
there going to be another ep?
GarretBrony Nah Stephen King ruined it for me. Besides theres a festival in this town. And they have BALLOONS!
Alpha-Omega: To much shit happens to California.. Try some other state
11,02inb4 Atlantis in the next episode.
Nah I was born there. I'm going to die there
so, listening to Forest Rain's "Pop-punk Pony" album. Save for the first track, I'm liking it so far.
Alpha-Omega: ave fun dieing then :)
G'day Mates, I was wondering if any of you would be kind enough to give me your oppinion on my poll here: http://micropoll.com/t/KE40pZN5xo Thanks ^_^
uhh next computer i'm getting intel and nvidia
Well I'm off. Night everypony.
Where I was born nothing bad happens
but of course, the first track was a pony cover of "You're Gonna Go Far Kid" by The Offspring, and I've made it no secret around here that I hate that album.
13wish i'd gone nvidia
13asuka was the best i could get though
DuskStarshimmer: thrid word spelt wrong.
Alpha-Omega: Well if you ever try to visit any other state.. never visit New York the crime there horrible.
oooh the narrator voiced the Cat from sailor moon?
I know my friend has a house there
Luna?
i guess?
lowfn: depends on what part of NY ctually. NYC has high crime rates simply because of its population. There are plenty of towns and cities in NY that have no more crime than any other place in the country
11,02Dat hot temperature.
RAWRity: mmmm.. your right
NADIA
MY GAWD
That lecherous look

Ok, gotta go everypony.....see ya all tommorrow

Uhhh sure Polydunami
Don't tell me... they're grand leader is.. Free Willy
Which episode is this, by the way?
Polydunami: 16 or so?
16? Sounds about right

Okay, so I missed the one where they bury the deceased man.
she isn't that fat
Man, that was a major episode and I just had to miss it :(
And poor Jean, is left out.
Damn I never though being would intraduce me to so many things
did it ever occur to any of the crew of the nautilus to call upon the Seaponies?
Now that's an interesting thought
c
So they visited Atlantis while I was away, huh?
What show is this?
11,02Nadia: Secret of Blue Water
an unexpected person
Dear Princess Celestia, Making a new friend... is a most precious thing - Your faithful student :)

Fighting is magic is going to be so eoic
What next? The Chosen One and Betty show up out of nowhere?

"I will tell you when you are older" :p

Aww, so sad :P
So Jean already knows his father is dead, then...
.... THEY ARE SECRETLEY TEACHING US THINGS
nah rainbow dash did it
Hopefully it's not trout flavoured...
He shouldve said he made it just for Nadia
Wait, that's yogurt, isn't it? :S
And then you pee the Earth's history?
Polydunami: frozen yogurt close enough :S
you terrible people, eating the earth's history
Well.. If you think about it...
I don't get it
They're eating 1200+ years of piss history...

lowfn, you cant enjoy anime without that, can you? :|
It's weird, but this old ass show has a more diverse cast than most modern anime.
Shizuka: wow, a companion cube?
Apparently racism flows backwards in Japan.
does anyone else find Nadia Hot?
Rain: Nope
What do you mean, old? :|
11,02Shizuka: Dat car
GarrettBrony: Me Im in her fan club
Is that image an inside joke?
RAWRity, what?

Hmm... I dunno about that. I mean, Nadia's fourteen...
Then again, so it Yoko Littner :P

well, in Japan, she's only 1 year from the legal age of consent.
Yeah, Yoko couldn't possibly have sprouted early... :P
I believe Yoko, supposedly, IS 14 at the start of TTGL.
I bet Nadia will actually turn fifteen in the anime.
... called it
Nice dodge...
11,02Looks like someone is trying to land a plane in Top Gun on the NES
what a pesemistic girl :\
SuperBrony64: do it with the power glove :S

11,02It's super effective!
they really should do that more often it the best part of the show.
Both Jean's and Nadia's VAs were both children in their preteens. Or was it Marie's VA instead of Nadia?
I dunno :P
I got my ass kicked like that when I was 14 too
Not denying the boyfriend thing? :3

So much lagm this is running on a PC I think.
ads are usually determined by ones search history >_>
Usually.
o rly?
Spectrum_Rush|: then why dont I get pony ads?
^
so my ads should be about ponies then
Haven't searched up Asian woman at all, actually :P
Or Russian women
plus i regularly clear my history
TheHoodyNinja, you make a good point.
Or chicas bonitas
TheHoodyNinja: casue the ponies you seach havent been exploited for ads yet
You kidding? I've seen banner ads for pony things around :P
I
Mainly on TV Tropes
Polydurian: yes but if you've searched anything unscrupulus related to those ads it uses a broad spectrum
clear my history as well
Oho?
:3
Spectrum, Spectrum?
Spectrum_Rush|: I saw an ad on youtube that said, and I quote, "Meet hot new brony girls today!"
@SuperBrony64, you are playing this?
i still have history from april
Polydurian: orly? like specifically G4 ponies
hahaha meetbrony girls
And how do you play online on PC version of Rayman Origins for Multiplayer?
Crap!
Dagnabbit, I refresh my stream embed and it asks if I like Asian women all over again :S
Polydurian: what? its the only word that i could think off :S

different tank types?
I would try to see how big of an explosion I could make
Time for a PARTY :$
heres your singing telegram
I love this song :)
I am about 5 secodns behind... No biggy...

Lemme guess. It became mainstream after meet the oyro Alpha-Omega?

01,04We play now o____o
What are you playong?
SuperBrony64: Define ''play''?
00,02D:
00,02Alpha-Omega, kerbal space program
*playing
OH GOD, SuperBrony64 IS POSSESSED BY A DEMON
This game is odd
11,02This game is not Call of Duty.
00,02ladder works
SuperBrony64: dat rage :D
What planet is this? :P
00,02so
Clotheslined by the spaceship!
00,02should i try to get back to kerbin with just the jetpack?
:D
YESSS!
That would be... interesting
We might find some glitches
Probably some beta stuff, too :P
Whats the max speed of the jet pack?
SuperBrony64:What are you playing?
I need more RAM D:
Oh and how far away is Kerbin from Mun?
11,02Alpha-Omega: Nutin :<
Apparently, my video card is pretty damn low (Can't read half of the effects on MMD) and RAM is the only thing why Minecraft is slow for me :(
00,02so
Plus, I need more RAM to play Kerbal either
Noooooooooo D:
00,02turns out the suits simply do not have enough delta-v to escape the mun
00,02BUT
00,02there is enough to escape minmus
Well then what did you mean by must stay up and play games?
00,02there was a bit of debrie stuck inside the mun
00,02and then i broke ksp
Oh well, more RCT3 for me :P
I
00,02disapointed that landing failed
00,02it was a near ideal location
Good morning guys :)
00,02morning max
00,02fallout 3 time
nice :)
ohai MaxTheBrony
I think I'm just gonna ask my mom for an alienware laptop for my birthday

Dat scared of outside
00,02lol
00,02wont go through the door
Hey everypony
Hi ponies
what be streamin?
Fallout 3
I beat this whole game except some of the addons cause they were boring
Wasn't much of a fan of 3... loved 1 and 2.
Phase4: Black widow is great due to most of the people ingame are males
also swift learner is good
00,02i'm thinking swift learner
00,02grinding for xp is booring
Yeah quicker xp lgain is awesome
Phase4: Then why the hell are you playing this? :3
00,02Very_Silly_Filly, because why no
00,02not'
Oh, okay :3
Oh god
My sister loved the Canterlot Wedding episode
didn't you get a gun?
Speaking of ponies
Now she makes weddings between her pony toys
I had a pony related dream last night :3
3 years old girls do shipping too :>
Phase4: Check all the places in the town!
Hm
Who's playing?
The streamer
phase4
man if only this game was co-op
Alpha-Omega: TBH, it would be a bit of a nightmare
not for me and my brother
Alpha-Omega: There is a extremely in alpha mod that's hardly even good at all in works,
Fallout :D
Phase4: Easy locks usually don't require moving the pin mostly
good morning everyone
fallout 3?
reminds me of the time I went to the school house when I was lvl 30
00,02it says danger
00,02is that bad?
Its Inside The School
00,02theres a guy held via invisible chains to the celing
He also needs to get HP
00,02this may be bad for me
11,02night all ^-^
...are people actually talking bout ponies there?
D: try not to be chained up on the wall
tood night superbrony
*good
Phase4: did you just kill that retired prostitute
00,02Spectrum_Rush|Busy, she was shooting at me
00,02i would not sleep in that bed
Phase4: i thinking of a different person pay me no mind
00,02ah
Phase4: my fav rule in bethseda games is if its value to weight is under 10 dont take it
Yay pinkie is bipolar
vers
*very
00,02StaticCloud, but its loot
true
....
Phase4: now you can play how ever you want but i just wanna tell ya if ya like pistols and rifles in this game, put points in small guns
small guns are weak
For everytime you let your child play M games, God incarnates an idiot
00,02how do i drop stuff?
00,02Alpha-Omega, you say as i sneak attack critical a guy
I use rifles
Phase4: right click in the inventory, i thinl
Allo?
Satin: hiya
Plus in any game I use the sneak. And that is how I became a master of sneak in oblivion and skyrim
SPLAT
Sneaking was all I did in Oblivion and Skyrim
oh that was tons of fun. sneak bow everything, problem solved
wow. phase sacked in a lot of crap
Also in Fallout 3 cause those stupid people wouldn't see you and I tend to avoid confrontation
oh that's just no fun
00,02anyone mind if i cheat through the door?
trust me at maxed out level everything become "fun"
00,02just want to see whats on the other side
Phase4: do it. everybody cheated in fallout some time
save before you do it
or just do it
oh no the ant hive
Oh yeah that's why I came back :D
00,02and then it crashed
you might want to put on some barding. just sayan
ah, the freezing problem
funny, i had that too. but it came only with a later reinstallation
/me is eating rice cakes :3
Man mothership zeta is an annoying addon
i liked it
I like operation anchorage better
For whatever reason, this map looks a lot like something you'd expect from Silent Hill
Well it is a wasteland
well, it'S a rotting schoolhoushe
*house
Phase4: been to the dunwich building?
00,02Dark_Horst, just started
VATS makes those surprise encounters a whole lot easier
it also looks neat. you shoudl do more vats^^
oh hell yeah! fallout! so is this 3 or new vegas?
3
3 new vegas sucks
Alpha-Omega: well i dont mind new vegas but i rather 3
depends. for the athmosphere, 3 is better. but new vegas has ore content
especially in forms of weaponry
I just don't like how slow new vegas feels
pew
00,02hmmm
00,02i know theres something to double what books do
gun
Phase4: comprehension
for now, gun nut is a nice one
swift learner is good for the start
that too
and then educated
ded
Phase4: play how you want to even if its not the most optimized just have fun :)
reminds me of the perk mistakes I made oh well.
Phase4: im gonna say now, most things you pick up can be repaired if you have 2-3 others of the same. even if you dont use them, you can seel them for more
Oh can't you get a AR rifle or bolt action rifle at this area?
Kinda have a blurry memory about it
Phase4: btw, after you disarm the bomb in megaton, they give you a house
He needs high demo skills though
High *ish*
not high. 35 is enough
00,02Flyboy, i've been repairing
or he can blow it up and get a suite in tenpenny tower
Phase4: also, how are you going to play, good or evil?
Megaton is overall the better option in the end
^
yeah it is
Spectrum_Rush|Busy: yes, but tenpenny isnt nearly as awesome as megaton
Spectrum_Rush|Busy: The house is bigger in comparison and all that,
00,02Flyboy, probably good
Phase4: then you wont want to listen to the guy in the suit who sits in the megaton pub
Dark_Horst: killerpony7733 i know i've atleast 15 different playthrough of the entire game
played one file and literaly explored the whole map
Spectrum_Rush|Busy: Played enough walkthroughs with almost complete OCD checking everyplace so yeah.....
Oh hes at the mall
someoe should tell him about the experimental mirv
^^^^^
the alien gun?
killerpony7733: same, oh the amount of times i was trundeling across the wasteland over-uncmbered in the high hundreds to 1k walking for ever... and ever
no. the mininuke shotgun
Spectrum_Rush|Busy: Eh my brain was nice enough to tell me to fill up to a certain weight level drop it at the house and back and forth
killerpony7733: sadly my brain didn't think of that till the tenth playthrough :D
didn't care much for special weapons. I just wanted to adventure
For me i just OCD'd the living crap out of the game
find ALL the cool shit
Ol' Painless, man i loved that rifle. simple plenty of repair material in the commom hunting rifles, could one shot a super mutant at max range without a sneak critical... sigh good times
Oh the fond memories of getting your first suit of power armor and eventually enclave power armor :3
I had the lincoln rifle
That gun is extremely powerful with all related perks and what not
that was a good one to, but damn was that ammo hard to come by sometimes
Spectrum_Rush|Busy: Yeah magnum ammo was annoying to find,
And the anchorage armor which never needed to be repaired
Winterized Power Armor
However i remember being easily able to cap almost over 1500 or so microfusion cells for my the unique plasma rifle which i used the whole game
That weapon killed everything in it's path
I used the wazer wifle
it is a sign when I can tell exactly where in fallout 3 this is after looking at it for 5 seconds
killerpony7733: the one from the android guy?
Spectrum_Rush|Busy: Yep, That one
plasma goo piles every with that weapon
I used that weird alien shotgun pistol
It has a extremely good range fire rate and damage once you get all the related perks that helps energy weapons and overall reloading etc etc
been almost 3 years since I last played fallout 3
Alpha-Omega: the what?
Phase4: you here on the quest?
it was a pistol but is sprayed bullets
Dark_Horst: Nope he is casually going to the place
00,02Dark_Horst, nope
Phase4: you should do the starting quest line by moira. really helpful. nice rewards
He needs to get all the rifles and shotguns and whatever guns he can get, As this is the first area in the game that offers you a nice gear boost
there are assault rifle magazines on the counter, btw
Phase4: Consist
Or not
damn... i totally forgot you could do soemthing like that while ahcking
fuuuuuuuck
^Dat realisation
Dat cheat
May require a trip back and forth
send out the robot
I was so thrilled :D
^Yep all the loot was the best way to get started in the game
Such shit computers :D
While they were slow as heck and everything you would be amazed would could be done with them
http://a7.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/599404_264126740367411_1881256092_n.jpg
^That fail information
ROBOT
Phase4: Check the employer thing you have
I love this game's robots
WUT
and then ded
mwa mwa mwaaaaaa
afternoon ponies :)
Just stand back and let the robot do his job!
Hey BronyInstrumental!
BronyInstrumental: good afternoon old chap!
Phase4: oh, that red arrow thingie in your vision? that was a 'nade indicator, btw
00,02ah
I went gun-ho and sneaky hits approach though
Durr
I just realized
something
What?
Phase4: i think if you try and help him, he kills you, dunno why
^
sup everypony :)
anyone here played roblox?
sup Michael
Probably the bot considers you a hostile too
Flyboy: most boring game ever
'sniff' sup
/me hugs BronyInstrumental
dat fallout 3 :D
Phase4 is the stealthiest
BronyInstrumental: well i guess everyone has their opinion and mine is that its a very creative game.
buffer
killerpony7733: yep
00,02killerpony7733, yeah, not sure where it is though
Go back to vault 101
The fast travel is a marvelous thing
You can't mistake the huge place right in the middle of nowhere
And surrounded by tall metal scrapes
phase4, it is pretty much straight away from the city
Phase4: If you can get some way to increase the demo skill and disarm the bomb and get a house looting and what not becomes easy for ya
bandits :D
easy loot
dat face
Dat stupid bandit with a knife
Point blank shooting :D
AP is so OP
point blanc*
The school became my fav bed place :D
MadSurge: Meh, Once you get your house anywhere else became irrelevant
need nuke colas
dun dun dunnn
killerpony7733: never bothered getting one :D
DED
Phase4: Oh take the armor! it's a good piece of early armor
dat asault rifle
NAKED CORPSE
It amazes me how everyone actually has underwear or something like that, Despite the fact most would be destroyed
I love how by fast traveling sometimes you can see the enemies you killed collapse as soon as you spawn :D
Oh yeah those buggy spawns
dat trash
hes gonna die over here
Most likely
Hi everypo- ooh Fallout! :O
Phase may end up getting his butt handed to him as he is travelling a bit too much outside for his current level and gear
howdy MegaMoonShine :)
THE WATER IS DANGEROUS Phase4!

Can you be this careless in the Elder Scrolls?
Sorta?

Well that explains it then :D

Hello MegaMoonShine :)

/me waves to Michael BronyInstrumental and MadSurge
Umm.

Computer science

:D Phase4 is more interested in coding than Fallout 3
Brother-Aura: wikipedia

It's 12:58 right now in good 'ol Britain
Phase+, read that book you picked up. it has weight and it is good for you
Phase4: use up the skill book you picked p. takes 1 weight
damn , can't wait for tomorrow

Phase4: Oh oh if you got books that is said to increase stats read them
Very_Silly_Filly: i say, old chap, you might just be squandaringly correct! :3

And I went to bed at about midnight
AAAAANT
Michael: what is tomorrowß
Dark_Horst: saturday :)
Phase4: dont wait until you get the comprehension perk to read skill books
If at first you don't succeed, skydiving is not for you.

Phase4: You really need to get that 35 ish explosives skill as soon as possible as you can get a house and everything early
00,02i think i have 35 explosives
If so check the nuke
I could imagine the next fallout with skyrim graphics... ME GUSTA!
00,02well thats done
Phase4: talk to simmsfirst
hello all.
the shrrif
Well that was easy
hai WallDives
00,02Dark_Horst, too late
Ohai WallDives :)
Is this what i call an ironman playthrough?
Phase4: Talk to the sheriff
congratz now u have a hose
*house
poor dude only wanted to say hi
omnomnom
Dark_Horst: you can do objectives of quests without talking to the people involded, it'll atomatically update the response, as you're seeing now
Kick the bomb
00,02um
00,02i've seen a lets play of this
Nothing bad will happen
00,02he's suposed to talk to you
Moira <3
00,02THEN you do the bomb
00,02THEN you talk again
00,02did i just break things?
Phase4: either or doesn't matter
Phase4: You avoided him!
Phase4: Nope no breaking things
Anyway Stash your unneeded gear and loot in your hosue
house*
00,02oh, i had 30 explosives
00,02oh well
if this was New Vegas you would have. but not in 3
Spectrum_Rush|Busy: i know. but i picked up the habit of gettingn the quest first since bugs
Phase4: he was supposed to walk up to you and talk at the gate, but you just passed around him :D
I'm back with 6 slices of Toasticles
Dark_Horst: same here, although i saved so often s i didnt always care
gotta level up some speech
Phase4: Barter!
This game is very loose on "breaking quests" though
00,02MadSurge, and disarmed the bomb before he made it down the hill
OW! The toothpick in my sandvich stabbed my lip
You can do everything out of order and you'll still get some loot
Phase4: barter is recommended. speech checks an better prices
TheRandomkid321: Ouch... :(
or ws that only the speec skill in 3?
TheRandomkid321: Pah, I put knives in my sanviches
Very_SIlly_Filly your name fits you
later everypony :p
Later Michael|Lunch :)
TheRandomkid321: Ya don't say :D
wadsworth!
Infinite water?! :O
I miss wadsworth
Oh...
nope
The best skill in NV in my opinion is science. So you can get into the strip for free.... Wait... Madam?
TheRandomkid321: Phase4's character is female
Lololololoolololololollololololololololol
Dat joke
Very_Silly_Filly Only one reason a male would do that... If ya know what I mean.
Well actually, being female in FO3 is better than being male, since more than 3 quarters of the people ingame are male
Yeah and thats where black widow gets really really really useful
Madam? Phase's character is a girl?
Yes
Yep
Very_Silly_Filly but most of the people you can have intercourse with are female.
00,02i asked the chat
00,02they said go female
TheRandomkid321: ...
That explaaaaaaains everything!
Phase4: sleep you'll heal up
His first tiem playing this?
TheRandomkid321: yeah
Playing any fallout?
Inb4 he gets caught
00,02i think it crashed again
00,02thats enough fallout 3 for tonight
It has.
HOORAY :D
Om nom nom nom sandvich ^_^
Phase4: baby steps, one at a time, are good :)
Karma is such a bitch
Very_Silly_Filly: as in, the karma system?
Yeah
If you get -9000 karma a man called karma appears and corrupts your save file.
A little karma can ruin everything for you
Karma system in the game is hardly anything,
It affects your luck
I was jesus I had so much good karma
:O:O
Just use the hobo outside town to up your karma :D
Because I level up by stealing and theft and such
00,02why do you REQUIRE a gfwl account to save the game
My karma was very very low
Arkham Asylum? Sweeeeet
In FONV reputation actually played a part in getting lowered prices information and gear you wouldn't unless you are on good terms with the said town
ohai, so this is what the leading channel on ponychat.net looks like
00,02ah
Very_Silly_Filly: I was a good guy :D
00,02you can create an offline one
And chances are, that karma cost me a good path in the game
00,02Batman time
Enable the batchat
Phase4: Stream is like three minutes behind i think
I had a kid in my class named andrew in primary school... he was a dick.
Mqn I used to have batman Arkum city then my friend's xbox ate it
BATCHEST
Bat nipples
Bat ass
^Such a punny joke
Bat credit card
....?
Mad Surge NO!
Who would win. Batman or Ze spy!
Batman duh
But what is the batman is a spy?
if*
I'd say ze spy. He would disguise himself as robin and then backstab batman
00,02batman is massive
he's ripped yes
why dont they just shoot him.
TheRandomkid321: i was waitinf for you to say that http://www.comicbookmovie.com/images/users/uploads/28226/whos-the-man-assassins-creed-enzio-tom-clancy-spinter-cell-metal-gear-solid-snake-batman-robin-team-fortress-spy.jpg
It blew my mind when I realized who Mark Hamill was
Dat looney toons reference
Spectrum_Rush O:

Those warnings... I can tell something bad is gonna happen
I'm thirsty, and there's no drink in :c
the fighting in this game is awesome
^
why dont they just kill the joker? havent they noticed that jails just dont work?
Dat Killer Croc hugeness
MegaMoonShine: Somehow the joker despite how insane he is he is god damn smart
O______0
Flyboy: Batman does't kill
killerpony7733: That's what makes him so damn scary
god i love this game
MadSurge: batman doesnt. the rest of them should
whats on stream?
Ingwaz: Arkham Asylum
Flyboy: and probably they consider him too insane to be worthy of the death sentence
MegaMoonShine: The condition interests me, Some people are sooo go damn smart but the insanity makes them dangerous
I FREAKIN LOVE SANDVICHES!
god'
Skyrim logo on TV
Flyboy: and anyway the Joker would evade before any capital sentence
they had guns...
SJ+HOOT!
I'M THE GODDAMN BATMAN
I used to be like you then I took a bullet to the parents
^
Dat harley quinn
hmm
ah good

Alpha-Omega: i'd touch it with any pole
00,02see that grate made of steel?
its child-friendly steel
She does itconstantly with joker as mentioned in arkam city the sequel it very disturbing
what is it with superheros/supervillians and monolouging?
It keeps them sane

In a a psychotic way

MadSurge: Whether they want or not.
MadSurge he wont's to turn our sad frowns upsie-down
Lil_B: Skywalker was too good for him :D and yeah, that's his job!

Anyone getting buffer?

Joker = Pinkie and Discord combined?
SirGanjalf|Scarecrow: pretty much

oni_link: Port aventura
Who is streaming? Can you private message me what program you ar using to mix?
Michael: I've actually heard of that one :3 hope you have fun
This smells of DJNilla
DixInfernus: I think this is a youtube video
oni_link: actually have the tallest rollercoaster in europe :$
00,03I can DJ too, you know :(
00,10I would afree but I have heard this song before
Scoot-Scootaloo: Lies
DixInfernus: I think its virtual DJ but if not it looks alot like it UI wise
Scoot-Scootaloo: put your DT pony on screen more peeps will relize its you
Michael: oooh that sound epic, the tallest coasters in US are in New Jersey I believe, California isn't too wild for rides :P
oni_link: I've seen a screencap of that latest virtual DJ, and it seems a bit more intense. I'll probably just go a head and snag the free version and role with it for a bit.
brb
Hmm, maybe it's SlurryMoon. The way the two videos are side-by-side reminds me of when he was doing that thing with the Fighter stick and SFIV
DixInfernus: Thats what I did :P
Been wanting to roll a ponytastic dance party after heard some of the great music out there.
This is pretty epic :3 the transitions are so well done
oni_link: yay gotta mount in it and Dragon khan :D
this is the awesome mixing of Scoot-Scootaloo you know
Scoot-Scootaloo, you show off you
00,10not gonna lie, that was rather well done
Michael: Haha so many loops :D I gotta get to a theme park before summer is over :P
Ohai Sumica!
I agree.
00,10ohhi
oni_link: hope you do it and HF
ohai Mica

Ah, cool.

Michael: I will and thanks. I'm looking foward to going to Six Flags :)
Going to download this thing and have some fun with it for a bit, hehee
I'll be the life of the (dance) party again.
08,01what is Six Flags?#
oni_link: i've heard of it, and looks kinda awesome
00,10I see two turntables but no microphone
00,10it's a chain of themparks that uses the loonytoons chraicters as mascots
oh come on fo3, you dont need to crash so much :(
oni_link: you said you're in california, so is the one in your locale magic mountain?
Michael: Yeah, theres this ride X2, and they have flamethrowers on it :) I kid you not
BronyInstrumental: Yesirreee
Oh, sorry. I remember going to Six Flags about 20 years ago. I remember the rides and atmosphere. I don't remember the mascots.
oni_link: lol flamethrowers, rly?
Oh wow. The UI for Virtual DJ 7 supports 4 songs? oO
Michael: lol eeyup :) Its so awesome
omg gotta watch it :D
00,03Macs have their advantages~

Everyone's amazed at Scoot-Scootaloo's phat beats! :D
Installing Virtual DJ now, This should be fun.
DixInfernus: it does look fun :)
MadSurge: That is does. I used to have Fruity Loops about two years ago. Just never got used to it, and didn't have the patience to properly learn it.
So maybe with mixing I'll have better fortune than actually creating.

Suddenly, dinner.
DixInfernus: You can do soo much with FL Studio but it has the steepest learning curve
0,5No, breakfast
O hai there BaconMane
No, U.
oni_link I had learned. I had some what got the basic gist of it, but then fine tuning a song came around XD
how you doing BaconMane
DixInfernus: Yeah, that I never really had patience for either haha
Hai BaconMane. Speakint of breakfast, I was having cornflakes just now.

DixInfernus: Yeah lol mashups get desynced, samples drag on too long etc. :D
00,10must have taken this program ages to scan all the songs to pick good transisions and such
Was kind of demotivating and frustrating
DixInfernus: Samples are a pain, coming up with original stuff is the worst though :D
dat song is so good
Good morning everypony!! :)
Haha, I'm considering geting fruity loops back and attempting remixes.
Whats this on stream? :o <3

Heya, Michael!
o.o

Hey Scoot-Scootaloo, I might have to ask you where you got all your tune from. :D
08,01Sumica: no, it's a traditional English song
Haha, Pinkie Pie Dancing Machine?

Ok, just need to find a way to preview a track *before* letting it play.
08,01# singing rule Equestria / Equestria rules the waves / Ponies never ever ever shall be / late in winter wrap up / in the village of ponyville #
Wonder if that is what the "sync" button is for?

RaveBrony: Well I WAS fine until Flash derped on me again.
Reikim: It derps alot for me too :(
who's streaming, cause that's quite some good work as a DJ in there
00,10make sure you manualy check for updates with flash

Hopefully it will help this awul derping x_x
*awful
00,10alternitively learn how to disable the new security on it
O.o
new security?
hey guys
good evening
Sumica: Eh...any further instructions on that?
00,10the new security they added to flash badly destablised it
ohai Straisin
heya Michael
Damn you, ADobe.
00,10yeah Reikim, it requires going in to the textfile that controlls flash settings and adding a comand line to it
00,10it was put in there for security which is a good thing
00,10so disable at your own risk
o_o
00,10it's to prevent sites from controlying your computer via flash security holes
Do you think updates will fix that? lol
00,10with tiem yeah they will get it working
Alright
Whelp, might as well just be patient.
00,10but right now it's much like how plugins for browsers run in an isolated setup from the browser
:O Italian Stare Master! :D
Im all for security!! But...its just getting ridiculous now....
00,10well I gave up after 3 weeks Reikim
00,10it was preventing me from being able to do much with youtube videos
I shall endeavour to be patient yet a while longer...
:D
I GOT MY DERPY :3
God im loving this music <3 Keep it up, Scoot-Scootaloo!
Although, last time I tried to be patient for something, it didn't get an international release.
