>Idon'tgiveafuck.jpg

CircutMane prolly not
Derpy's version

http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/27329/Dune+2000.html
Mass Effect 3
Mass Effect 3

can't freaking wait
skyrim ftw

:P
1st one was my favorite
Dune 2k is abandonware now?
lol, MW3 PMVs
I reccomend Dune 2k
Yep
no, look in the related videos
WANT!!!
Mass Effect 3 for the win.
^_^
gow 3 FTW
2nd one was awesome but went down a bit for me
or was that a "Just kidding, I posted Applejack"?
It's abandonware
Mass Effect 3 is looking to be great.
0i really hope they don't screw up ME3 like they did DA2
da2 sucked
Hmm. Might have to grab that.
Also, yes Mass Effect 3 is going to be ... EPIC!
imho
Good RPGs?
The guys on Abandonia make absolutely sure
you and me both, nah
oh, hahaha
That something's abandonware
good thing i didnt buy da2 though
before releasing it
DA?
sooo yeah
I like AJ's version
Frame_Rate_Pony They might need a bit more bonuses to fill a BD imo
isn't ME3 going to be the last one?
I'm really looking forward to MA3
THEN EXPLAIN X-COM!!!!
well
Trust me, they're strict about it
*facehoof
planned?
derp
ME3**
:P
haha
(erm, Gate, not Get.
Not download for free
I kind of like it too
Hold on
Ahh damnit.

ps DNF is shit on the 360
I'm a console peasant

They played it a lot at this camp I went to in 7th grade
oh,and they used the same cave over and over
I got too many FPS games.
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/02/100-things-pinkie-pie-is-not-allowed-to.html

Sorry for the random link
lol

Unique strategy
Like X-Com or WiC
kinnet finally getting some good uses
Outline, it's not on Abandonia
GOG.com is a good place.
ya good one
yes
0ShinChan <3
i am
360 here
I Googled it and some site has it
Requesting Muffinproof.
all of them
pc/360
But I don't trust it
Hrm. That's a shame
seriously
I disagree
fps on consoles is flawed
Oh, there is TeS
anything else consel unless i like to mod it
analog sticks are terrible for accuracy
PONY POLKA
pony polka please
aye, FPSs on consoles are just awkward for me too
on their site for free
yes
yes
And a couple of sequels too
YES!
yes
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPZjo7y2nnE&feature=related
excellent chioce
i grew up with Doom with uncles x3
AgnitioExMachina: If the site is GOG.com, trust it.
I always had a problem with switching between guns and controlling my team without a keyboard
It's not GOG
They're quite legit.
Pinkie's version is to music from my ancestry's homeland
a whole house playing doom on computer x3
i have every single polka on a playslist, and it takes over a half an hour to finish
Well then buy it there :P
oh, by Weird Ak
www.freeoldies.com
Awesome!
Or something else
wish it was longer
yeah
Doom and Doom 2 are still great
I'd play an FPS for my Wii, but I never seem to find the time to go out and buy one...
0does the aftershow just go on the entire night
I just don't trust the site
wii doesnt even have that many first person shooters does it?
I remember when parents shat themselves over DOOM
dude don't do FPS on the wii
BFG
thats a bad idea
someone made doom for wii as a hack
Resident Evil 4 worked really well on wii
I need income uneployment sucks
I like the 2nd DOOM
0bluh
There were a couple of CoDs i think
oh well ok then
Hey are any of the other X-Com games good?
best part now
really hate RE4
RE4 might work
Whenever I get a console I always end up forgetting about it and never playing the thing
FEEL GOOD
11Feel good, inc. Good song
Idk
nn leoshi
it was such a turn off the series
and there were the RE railshooters
0Resident Evil <3
AND WE'LL ON FLOAT ON ALRIGHT
Probably
very good song
Yeah, no, GOG's the only site I know of that distributes it legit right now
Wait hold on
I hear good things about all of the X-COMs
aladdin and starship troopers
I should probably play 'em, since I got 'em for free
0RainBroDash <3
i prefer the pony pokie
sigh
lol
Ohh I would like that song.. Fell good inc

http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/96/UFO+2000.html
more of a caffeine-free mountain dew man myself
0Vodka!
I drink it once in a while, but never get drunk
Beer is good, guinness is good, there is a microbrewery in colorado that makes one of my favorite beers though, called "Hazed and Infuzed"
Great vid
It's X-Com multiplayer evidently
Root beer all the time for me
I only drink if its a special get together
whisky is awesome
0Vodka is the drink of champions!
And it's abandonware
evidently
Caffeine-free, blasphemy!
sigle malts as well
...
do the 8-bit remixs
0Vodka, all day, erry day.
Great Mouse Detective
Kahlua and chocolate milk = delicious
some people don't need caffeine

Night Frame Rate
I found out about it on KYM
In very early March

lol Rainbow
I remember the EXACT moment I joined the herd
0Good ol RP bros
Dosbox + free games = win

http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/195/Elder+Scrolls+-+Arena,+The.html
back
There's the first Elder Scrolls
0Epsiode 5, Day before my birthday
You need Dos-Box to play it though
/me looks back and sees the topic is still free/share/abandonware games, leaves again
and a little loony
0Decided to watch it on my Birthday
Look it up and download it
lol
rawre
my little niece actually introduced me to the show. I was babysitting her and she wanted to watch ponies.
ok
RIGHT ROUND
http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/27432/Elder+Scrolls+-+Daggerfall%2C+The.html
And there's II
0And I have some CRAZY birthdays.
i would like to try to do a my little pony FiM D&D campaign at some point
by 'ignored it', i mean ignored ponies
I watched the first two eps after I got home from work
thats awesome
My Little Seinfeld plox

0My Little Seinfeld

xD
i still think RD is tomboy. not lez
Exclamation Point
she don't know whatg she's missing
^^agreed
I'm packing now
i think she is Tomboy too
ok
Yep, my friend nuke showed me WWU, and I thought it was bad because of of Rarities first lines about boots. I cam to like it eventually
0Broonsbane, I would do anything to get in on that.
RD is more borderline for me
i need more ponies
lawl
I still got the drawing challenge to do, and probably should clean up around my area
ponies ponies ponies
RD is bi as every one cool is BI ( at least in my experirences XD)
i used to know someone like RD, she was totally lesbian
Hey, talk about ponies and I'll probably talk about them too
pony pony pony pony pony pony pony pony pony pony pony pony pony pony pony pony pony pony
0Yeah, neither am I
hehe well, while we are up, how about a good horror movie
YES
PONY
Otherwise, still more abandonware
i'd be one of the ones that follows the rules
MORE PONIES

and kills everyone
oh it's okay
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWw
11:D
awsoem

HEY THERE
DJ-pon 3 x3

I don't think I can get sick of them
...
I think it's software that the rights to have been given up.
i really like how they are reacting to the fanbase
http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/184/Grand+Theft+Auto.html\
Something along those lines.
yeah
6:30
Just gonna leave that there
^ me too! :D
yeah only show eavr that cares about the fans
Rainbooms are epic
its rare to see a show that listens to the fans
cant wait for s1 dvd's
i dont know any other show that does that
pony fabulous
let alone a girl's show
Basically they're not being sold anymore
I just need to move the fuck out
is it fuzzy or furry coats? I never got that
D:
and are public domain now
i know a few shows that did it
I got hooked first episode
Ponies!
Ponies are evil creatures.
Ponies are awesome.
I must agree.
0YEEEEEEEEEEES
Yes, like ghosts.
...and sasparilla
Conversation With Cleverbot.

OMG AWESOME

Cool story
>had ponies in playlist
>pokerface.jpg

:(
:(
wheeee
Cleverbot. Not exactly the most reliable conversation partner.
dude
/me falls asleep
suddenly, loud
Ever since /b/ screwed it over
yea
you could always draw
0Nothin; suits me like a suit
It needs a huge reset
Zoot Suit?
They basically forced meme responses
0Dang, that episode when he got the suit encrested with Diamonds
I finally converted my sister, she agreed to watch the first season if I agreed to watch Supernatural.
I'm surprised there's no My Strongest Suit from Aida
It was the beginning of the cancer era
a few years back
you can also always text me
my bros would just dwell on it way too much if i told them
HIMYM is awesome brb finding torrent
Ironically they also made it popular on the net
lol.
just if I'm not awake yet I won't answer until I am
Wow I just realized where this song is from.
lALW
:P
where is it form?
where is it from?
except they would be sisters
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfoGBVM86PM
LMFAO at the end
lol
oh
Hmm.
0How I met yo motha!
this vid is pretty awesome never saw this one
I also don't have unlimited texting
they'd just make it out as being something it isn't, and probably shout at me for 'going back to the internet' (I'm a recovering WoW player and 4chan addict xD)
Dicks are PG
Yeah, I know
nonsense
exactly
XD
ponies are on TV
i converted 2 people into the fandom x3
500 per month and after that it's $0.20 per text sent and recieved
I was there the day /b/ officially turned catanically cancerous
and he did and the rest was history
Hah no-one can quit WoW
Mine torture me by sending me the most horribly written clopfic they can find. I think they enjoy my rage.
I got on 4chan when it was "new" and I was way too young for it XD
Still gotta say
but if you want to text me just a little bit
i haven't played WoW for a while...
I still call /b/ cancer
Rainbow Dash's armor
Nah, it's been more than a year now, I've got hardcore willpower
but then again i've been busy with other games
ftw
like i want to play it
WoW is shit now anyway
RD armor is awesome
4.2 looks promising
yea it is
Also one of the reasons I no longer use Chans
YTP?
but i'd rather ladder SC2 or play TF2
never liked wow IDKY
lol
ok
The crap I had worked for got taken away by a bunch of little sh**s
i did not think it was worth my money after i hit 65
or 60**
lol
should I try making My little pony skins for tf2 or something?
I liked WotLK pre-Ulduar :/
don't hate
i just thougth of that
LOL
LOL
All other WoW is shit

I'll probably just start over one of my GBA games

adventure
...hm...I have to go to work at 11 in the morning...nah I'm staying up to see the next topic atleast
oh and the sequel
damn those where good games
I'll just set an alarm

derp
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6FUR_nhGX8
i hate the 3D ones in personal opinion
it killed it
ponies are more important than sleep
;o
welcome to the void
which one of you stole my guitar pick, I am livid
I have to at a con in 4 hours
I actually like the song, despite being gibberish
*burrows*
i was a dumb kid
It's the fans that annoy me more than the newer games.
Like that one swedish one
like, Loituma something.
Ivean Polkka?
Something.
It's Ivean Polkka
xD
Sure.
Which con?
man we really like to argue about videogames don't we?
4Silverscreen: Uhhhhhh
i only looked at the SA2 was okay
4No
hey
HaxBrony, no not at all
4Sonic 2 was the best in the series
well its less a con than a writers thingy but still
Hello thar.
Greetings 1597
hello night ponymanguy
of course
i havent played colors
me neither
last year it got one of my 100 word stoies published
Yeah xD
Colors is epic
Color's is a glad exception
wat
WAT
Heard it from my classmate's presentation
11RainBroDash: SA2 was horrible compared to its predecessor. The level structure was weak and linear rather than the freeroam of the first, the graphics actually looked WORSE, not to mention the story was all over the place. I didn't even manage to finish it because I couldn't handle playing it.
It's safe
but theres a pony synchtube marathon going on now
I already got Generations pre-ordered
equestria daily rocks
hated heros
The Russians hated it because it was American or something
it's been there for a while
11But that's my opinoion.
sure
http://ninjawarior.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d3j194p
marathon whut?
I forget the song name, though
thanks muffin_hooves
I'll respectfully disagree with that, Silbverswcreen
11And I hear Color isn't too bad.
about SA2. I like SA and SA2 equaky
4Sonic Colors was actually pretty damn fun
nice xD

FUCK THE BOURGEOISIE
Favorite of the Mane Six?
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Snake! SAKE!
The horror.
11I hate this part. x.x
lol
FOUND MY PICK YEAH
Pinkie Pie for me, sorry, but the show won't be se same whitout Pinkie
brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrb

Madness Returns any good
i ignore all reviers
4God
ebrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr

After all, she's like the LEADER of the PROTAGONISTS
hercules really
well that shortened my lifespan.
lawl
?~!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?! ebrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrb
11Yeah, they dropped the score for Madness Returns BECAUSE OF THE MAP BORDERS!
derp
Well, not really.
a PONY?
I like over-emphasising
It's the only show I've seen where you could put up a viable arguement for ANY of the characters as the "best" one.
why is this being played =(
MAP BORDERS OMFG
11How fucking stupid is that?
windknight...not cool
Yeah xD
gmod
4I wouldn't be surprised if they dropped the score because lack of Multiplayer too. Oh, don't forget that THERE'S PLATFORMING IN IT
did they own FO3 and NV for them
4And it's a fucking platformer
need moar dash
And then basically befriending the mane cast?
quite literally
everything has to have multiplier >.>
OMG a remake of a 3rd person action platphormer has platforming
Without her, there'd be no MOTHERFUCKING CELESTIA
Opinion and preference weigh too heavily.
SHIT1
exactly, i think
11No, they did complain about "a repetetive fighting system"
fo'neva?
celestia could have handled it
You say that like it's a bad thing Agnito :P
never
4I remember hearing that, but otherwise there was actually no mention of gameplay otherwise
lol
exactly
exactly
IGN is just there spouting shite
OH SHI-
LUNA...
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/25356
oh like Fox news?
a bit harsh
11Honestly, I think IGN just hates on anything that doesn't have CALL OF DUTY on the cover.
Agn keep that in EquestriaAfterDark
Luna is a train of severe emotional instability
lol
still a mystery why she haven't appered at all in season one, after the second episode
Nah, IGN hates anything that doesn't pay them
4In fact, was lack of multiplayer and repetitive combat really a reason for giving it a 6.6?
lol
6This is truth.
I have an itching feeling that IGN is a covert branch of Fox News
User, she's locked in a towe
http://imgur.com/QyBsB
Multi-player sucks.
brb
no frigging pony plushies ;-;
I want a twilight plush
Buy dem
it 80% of games its shity xp based grindfests with NO SKILL BAR GETTING A DROP ON SOEM ONE
oh
brb wata
LLLLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG
they might have that show on DVD
cod fighting system is still virtual whack-a-mole
that would be awesome
Outline theres a release date now?
^
lawl
hopes=dashed
Like SC?
I'm still waiting, chomping at the bit in fact, for Guild Wars 2
like warcraft 3
It's fall winter.
lol buffering
On the toys?
It is
hey
they made celestia pink,
CircuitMane like say ME3
at least just a 4 player coop
11CircuitMane: Actually, I could easily see an RPG with multiplayer.
not anymore
xD
CoD is the gaming franchise that could use co-op
I don't really know why it matters.
=/
6There are quite a few good multiplayer RPGs.
does FF6 count? where both player 1 and 2 could select attacks
The toymakers are Chinese
belive me I've hacked it in
Don't expect a quality product
FF6 counts as one
except for Chinese dishes and such
as well as earthbound
same
I mean China
w.e.
11Anypony hear ever hear of Lost Vikings?
Yes
4Kinda like how everyone and their mothers were BEGGING for multiplayer in Skyrim
Oh yeah!
Yeppers
yep
11Sweet
Damn Chinese, stealing the jobs of India
WE SHOULD BE OUTSOURCING MORE TO INDIA
>.>
...
Yes!
Affirmative
yes and no
its single player full stop
Okay, I don't think we should go into the topic of foreign laborers any further.
I think there was a remake on the GBA.
it just make it to try to match todays "modern" gaming
and suger coat it
11Dee_Twenty: That wasn't a remake, it was just a re-release.
sugar**
Domestic laborers, then?
:D
BEST NIGHT EVA
Fable 3 was awesome, well I liked it at least
lets just keep this at ponies
lol
yeah, the first one was good
Billions and billions of stars, billions and billions of specks~ <3
4They're concentrating strictly on first player
fable 3 just isnt as charming or fun
4Silverscreen wut?
ik that
4Robin?
And... well
but I really liked the epic feel of Fable 3
@SherlockHooves considering Fable 2 you can just say hi to everyone and get enough money to do everything in 20 minutes kills a challenge
Ehh, they newed to fix her body type first
11http://gotgame.com/2011/06/16/the-boy-wonder-will-be-in-arkham-city/
yeah likely as DLC/bonus challenge maps
i like bad religion, they make good music

back in 1 and 2
No, prob not
i casually play multiplayer fps
I don't wanna go into why either as it'll piss the mods off
Oh well, not like I was ever going to buy it anyway
There's.... really no way to make it single... unless you wanna play bots
That's possible.
CharlesAppleJackson I think he means one against all
Herbert MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON!

According to madmax, Twilight is link.

Worst thing about applejack is that she sucks.

You said to skip Trigger.
Oh, cool. I've never been to six flags
Tigger? Where?
Yup yup, prenup.

all money, nothing to do with it and everything is shared
Yeah
it was grat
and free

11It does mention how Stalin abused the system for his own gain, and how it smothered the people of the union in the worst of times.
Make way for the Chaotix son
I assume it's not that thorough. Just like birthday benefits. at restaurants.
Yeah
yup

I like ponies.
Er, omit the random period that found its way into that sentence.

0cant beat the Fal'cie in chapter 9
I've ridden horses before
I hate horses
for bolivion horses
They're fuggin stupid
Though the cons camethough to me in sacasum plus I was AFK for a bit of it
Esp drawn ones
lol
Am I weird
???
NOT BYE THEN
lol
kinda

I have ecpresso to make on mass
In order to keep it from getting crowded though, you have to be signed up for their email newsletter to know when it is

no offense, dues extra machina
?
finally a benefit to spam email
:P
oh
guest, none taken
cool
I know how bizarre it seems
I really have no idea, probably tex but I'm not sure.
But I don't like real ponies that much either
yeah
kinda
why?
xD
wtf
Having just rode in from horseville.
lol
Probably because they're too much like horses
They're not cartoon ponies.
Wait wait wait i just noticed this and everpony must know
11o.o
And they're not cartoon ponies
yep
HERE'S FLUTTERSHY!
11what the fuck...
xD
Well, sorta.
But, whatever.
but yeah
there's a vid?
celetia?
Yeah, I always wondered about her size/ shape relative to all her subjects
Yes!
I'd ride Celestia all day...on some horse trails
She's an alicorn, and presumably much, much, muchhhh older than any other pony except maybe Luna.
YES
or else she'd never know about it
even her cousin (?) wasn't like her at all
MY FAVORIT POLKA
And maybe the sky <3
FULY MEMORIZED
oh
YAA
wait
change that name please
Snips?
me too
can someone esplain someting please?
SOAD xD
lololololol
yeah, same here
it open a world of other songs for me
why does everyone mock that one pony?
I think the size of an Alicorn is the Alicorn's power level
the crosseyed one?
THE VINES
way too much to filter through
And Derpy? Go ahead
Yeah, I can imagine.
Derpy is the best pony
Aww, then Luna wouldn't be even half as cute.
Derpy is always relevant
why dost most mock her?
Linker, no, she'll be HAWT
cool
just for her odd eyes
Dittzy Derpy Doo iswin
i always hoped he was
hi
hey hey!
Oh wow

FEAR ME
Someone call the power of the ponies! My net is starting to crap out again!
Why?
*Shepard voice* Charge.
i think i ruptured my spleen at this polka, can't believe i've never heard it
Some people go mad with power.
MY WAY OR THE HIGHWAY
I go mad WITHOUT power.
Mao Zedong for one
I won't need to the ACT for the colleges I'm looking at, but it wouldn't hurt to take it.
lol
It's really boring.
I'm already mad.
PEARZ ABUZ is bad. xP
they are amazing
Power is for wimps.
How ironic.
and there are some good 80's music polkas too
the songs in it though, ASFIJAIKOFAHFN
Don't let me eat pearz. I. HATE. PEARZ.
:D
Orph, I am a godkillerkiller

6duMORI... I dislike you right now.
6I want coffee.
Just kidding
Like, I've gotten more comments on my pony remix than any of my other music ever
On the other hand the 80's and 90's didn't have the epic anti-fail of FiM.
combined
nice
it is soooo good
esspresso is delicious
6Then again, I haven't even had food in over 24 hours.
i remember seeing one somewhere
just really nice beans too
...
ok
11Dee_Tweenty: Then again, 80's and 90's didn't NEED an anti-fail show
this song
:D
Is it just me or does this site/community move at such a breakneck speed that it is hard to keep up.
lol
Hi
6I'm broke, I don't eat much.

11Muuufiiiins

damn you I'm broke
well shit, i could do that
I worry now that I'll only be able to view S2 in the context of "How cool would THIS shot look in a PMV!?"
One side note, DNF was a bit of a let down for me. That's all I got to say. Keeping it on Ponies
why, just why
well i had to set up all his VPN tunnels, RDP, and other shit
Hmm....
*Europe

Whenever I want to read a fanfic I just read Doom: Repercussions of Evil
13Uxie here!
Or already too long to read.
11what the fuck is this?
Some shipping is okay, imho
hi
6It's a parody of a parody
Agreed
13Hey!
Like some of it's really cleverly done
IMHO
of a parody IIRC
cute
and then capt_slowpoke was the demons
How's it goin?
it's the crowning pinnacle of literature
11wow...
11this vid is...
13Good. Exept the ShoutWiki site is down, again!
11so stupid.
4Hey, it was relevant when we were showing The Real Eggman
hehe surprised the world is not imploding in on itself

Oh come on
We need to mash five crossovers in one story.
yeah well the orginal leather pants had a found spoting my heart due to a night out with a massive crush of mine

maybe they would be corrupted like during their trials in the second episode
I HATE crossovers...
No.
Aww that sucks :(
Give them time >_>

4Why is this playing?
Oh hey
4Who suggested it?
and legitimately haunting
not sure x3
hmm
Noone i think
Hmmm..
It has all the plot it needs
11This vid got 20% cooler
13That's where the wiki DSD and I came from is
It's pretty akin to her personality
6I'm playing whatever.
wtf are we talking about?
Then my buddy crashed.
lol
oddly not me
XD nice
Ponies, I guess.
4You should totally stream JJBATAS
wadun't me
Play the Sea Ponies song, it's really catchy.
11how long is this damn vid?
lmao YGOTAS
oh x3 its a playlist x3
yeah, I'm feeling the same way
I don't want sleep

Frightening.
PINKIE AND THE BRAIN

THE OTHER'S INSANEW
lol
11:D
Ppth.

That's five dimensions too few.
but I'm sure it won't take long
Mainstream.
Fell from the sky...
Was this written for My Little Pony or Yu-Gi-Oh
I think we can all agree we need a pony FPS
Hm... I'm just looking at UConn's site now.
I used to be known as Andromeda...
Metal_Link ygotas
4I"m muting this one
4No thank you
6XD
6TROLOLOLOLOL
That's productive
Why does this fit Twilight and Pinkie perectly?
we need an FPonyS
yeah I dislike this xD
4So much right now
11We should start watching some Yu-Gi-OH and DBZ Abridged
6Just messing with you.
Wheee!
best pause ever
hmmm
hah
"The University of Connecticut's Waterbury campus serves more than 1,000 students annually." I lovr how they try to make it sound like that's a lot.
How would it work?
*love
lol
nope.avi
Hahaha, yeah
x.x
11buffer?
ugh
how do any fps games work? you shoot bad guys
keesshhaa
I'm thinking something class-based, like Team fortress 2
4Fist of the North Star, which is just about the manliest fucking anime you'll ever see
*turns off my headphones*
actually brb anyway, gotta get mroe caffine
mfw Ke$ha is a guilty pleasure of mine. HATERS GONNA HATE HARD
That's a little bit more thna my high school.
*than
11ah
meh.
YES
even kesha
is that the population of the entire campus, or just freshman?
make it 720.
32 player multiplayer on cloudsdale
Hey guys
4Also muting this
Well, it says annually, but that could mean either thing.
13Spyropedia's got less pages, and a bigger mess, but I don't mind.
=(
hey
miniguns
Are there any good PMVs? In b4 lol good PMVs
Incoming or total.
only 38 left :(
They used apple pies
There are some
I'm going to assume that's all, though. xD
11I'm gonna go, everypony.
11Goodnight.
as for incoming that's probably close to where I'm going to school
pinkie can double-bounce really high
bye
and goodnight
<3
6I played a ton of PMVs, to be fair.
Nah earth ponies are just straight up inferior to other castes.
this song+ camaro soundsystem= gooooood times.
more even
Gnite!
11I H EARD NANCAT!
lol nyan
11NYANCAT*
They have greater earth-based abilities
11WHERE WAS IT?!
its 7am here man up
6was an add
yep
yeah its 1:30 here
Same lol
6*ad
Even according to Faust herself.
not really that bad honestly
If I have my facts straight, that is.
I thought I was going crazy too
They do the menial tasks.
Maybe earth ponies can work in a supporting context
Have fun with that
Nyan Pinkie is best Nyan.
11okay, I leave now.
just saiyan
this one is public I'm guessing?
really?
ha
is awesome
it really cool
Not by other ponies but we know
we know...
That's CANON
to be honest, I think earth ponies are naturally stronger than pegasi or unicorns
*shrugs* sorry to be random
omg
alright, time to open a bit of Nyan Cat
brb
I've heard that their power is more like a passive buff, like increasing crop yield, superior stamina/strength...
they would have to be, nothing else to rely on
;)
*prepares to not believe*
go on guest
No way. If she can pull 1600 Gs with no problem
has there been any PMV's with pendulum?
*sits on edge of couch*
awesome fact was awesome
GASP
Woohoo!
OMFG
little girls watch this!
16
6lol buffer
Quite.
uh
dude
A NOT 20 SOMETHING MALE WATCHING MLP:FiM?
24
yeah i know
i hate tuning down...
lol
BLASPHEMY
Wut?
Yeah
Hmmm..
a little girl
That's not a kid's show
with her friend!
Yeah... too public.
I have an idea for an alternate take on Derpy's personality
you should cover their eyes
Haha
Isn't nyan really old like 2008
my bass has been in Drop D for ages. never bothered retuning it
She's actually a shell shocked veteran.
it's not for them to watch
Since when have little girls watched FiM? Inconceivable, I tell you!
Man who'd have thought that a show for 18-30 year old males would be popular with little girls?
0love this song
Might have to enroll under an alias.
but you dont really need to drop it to C#
i didnt wanna embarrass her
well that's weird
but aparently
just tune down a halfstep
the nice thing about public is it isn't as spendy
okay what's this other idea for derpy's personality
i got her interested in it
Haha, you should definitely do that
and she got HER friends interested in it
6I'm learning Winter Wrap Up on my keyboard, and my bass.
Ciroton's Derpy.
Nopony: I just told you, shell shocked veteran
well I tune down halfstep, but then to get the lowest bass note in the riffy part in the first verse, it's that low c~
c#*
ohhh
Hahaha, yes!
1000 yard stare
is there tabs or something for Winter Wrap up on bass?
6Not that I can find.
Meh, I wish I hadn't stopped learning the alto sax
I was trying to reference Catch 22
I've seen her depicted in some fics as merely having a vocal disorder.
i always wanted to learn base, its only a 3 string guitar but some reason i feel its much harder >.>
stupid young me
We must act quickle 'o my brothers...
bass*
Get GuitarPro guise!
I think the whole universe can be her dying BZ hallucation, like Jacob's Ladder
quickly*
but I forgot the name of the author they always sign documents as
4 strings.
Though in my headcanon she's pretty intelligent but with terrible hoof-eye coordination.
There's guitarpro tabs for everything
i ahve guitar pro.. i think
oh thats not that bad
there's a torrent for it somewhere
6Bass allows you to be much more creative than guitar, I feel.
Aw, can't remember either.
BELLY FLOP
*splash*
Imagine if I enrolled as Yossarian, though.
=(
as long as you don't succumb to just playing the root note erry time :P
XD
That would be awesome
;p;
KNIVES ARE SLAVES
i must gather the pony folk
I should read that book again
and the pony yolk
i still like the rage against the machine style guitar playing
that was an entertaining read
I need to play more often
and even the pony solk
wait
6I had a guitar, had to sell it for food money.
=(
is there a daymare?
a
6I'm close to doing the same with my bass and keyboard...
daymare sun?
awww
OOOOOOOOOOOOH IDEA!
:(
i have lots and lots of callouses because of my guitar
that makesme sad =(
lol
yeah
callouses
Celestia's evil twin?
6I kind of do.
with a mustache
6I'm 20.
evil superpowered side
lol
i guess
Pff.
i need to learn guitar
agh my tablet is acting up\
4Would you be interested in joining a band?
woohoo
I WOULD
be interested
:)
you have no power here!
Oh gods.
(left my last band a month ago)
I WOULD, oh wait, england for the loss.
EVERYONE MUST EAT MY ICE CREAM
everyone, guard their silverware!
yes
lol
6 1 hour and LOOPING
Washington Irving!
i lost interested in bands when i was 20 x3 i did it all in highschool
That was it!
That was the alias they all used
dont have to be good now, can become good
6Because I have nothing to play.
can become great
Are we really going to go the full hour? XD
Yeah
nice analysis, moon
yes
we are
6XD
going to go
the full hour
:D
for a little while
wait, really? I need to rewatch that
shit I am WIRED now
same
6We're going as long as I feel like it.
Hmmm... You wouldn't mind me putting that armor back together, would you?
I sign everything at school as "Patches O'Hoolihan."
Seriously someone needs to ship NM w. pinkie
canst you speaketh more
pint of ecpresso is trippy
XD
6Which means probably a while, since it's looping.
What's that from?
nyan song = me leaving
ship?
4Is there anyone in the current room that enjoys post-rock music?
=(
Dodgeball. :P
and I'm back on the stream
6And I'm pulling an all nighter for the stream tomorrow.
yes
Oh yeah, hahaha.
is cool
w. spoons
0it shall be stuck in my head for the next 2 weeks
Don't forget those
indie is also
I enjoy all(most music) if its good
cool
no NO SPOON POWERS
muting the stream for a bit, playing winter wrap up for guitaring
<3
One time I jotted down: "If you can read a form, you can dodge a ball."
(yeah all music is pretty good)
except for rap
<3
and pop
especially if you are a lame supervillian
ALL ABBBOOAARDD
The trick is finding an alias you are proficient at writing in cursive
i mean really
I'm sorry, *dodge a form
XD
some rap is ok
Hey there Outline
Not sure I'm proficient at anything in cursive.
oh my sister! Spoonlestia!!

6buffer says no to this vid.
(Any rap from Gurren Lagann doesn't count.)
I'm sooo sorry!!
4So then calvindapanda, and mib_xosqn3 like post-rock. Noted
Haven't practiced it since third grade.
Hey there
thank goodness our only hope@!

=D
Evidently it's on the SAt, though.
Nerdcore <-- best rap
lol
hello spoony@
a mi me gustan las gruperas :)
yes i did
My signature consists of three letters, then scribbles
and id do it again
...uh
though tbh I say tis as a writer with a social group full of performace poets
ok?
My analysis is this, if I was merely a manifestation made physical, then after getting blasted, all traces of me should've disappeared, leaving little Luna on the floor.
wtf
Cha/\/\/\/\/\/\/
why is this stopped
LUNA!!!!!!!!!!!!!
because someone spoke in spanish
are we just playing this for an hour now?
music is like awesome
Hahahaha!
LUNA

FOALS

I read it as "Chav."
moonpie
:D
XD
YES
:/
would she really adress us as such!?
i think not!
I am a chevalier
reveal yourself!
soon
Sleep is for the weak, ponies for the strong!
preferably now
I have to start signing things in graffiti as "Alex DeLarge."
XD
I'll have to see this through
its 3 hours past dawn damn it
that was Catch 22 also, wasn't it?
nop
nope*
I can't belive spoonlestia made me go to spoonyville to make FRIENDS D:
Oh right
um idk luna isnt as good as fluttershy
i think i see spoony pie walking uyp
fluttershy
I'm immune to two things, tiredness and hunger. I did this thing, and now I'm all superhuman and shit, long story

If you go without sleep long enough you'll start to see ponies.
Greetings HeatWave

4Activating Keanu "whoa"
Never got my hands on a copy of the novel.

Me too!
cronicn imsonia is fun
How did you know I was compiled of two different genders, guestpony?!

And second warning. One more and bye bye.

lol
KotOR is awesoem and KotOR 2 is ok-good
I merely decided to stay.
hehe
though I've been learning lately that they sugarcoated the translations when I was younger
:P
lol
Oh. Well that's neat. I do hope you enjoy it here.
/me 4prefers KOTOR 2 to the first KOTOR
Well, that's it for me. Goodnight everypony.
Haha, figures.

Haha, yeah
KotOR 2 without the TSL Restoration mod doesn't exist.
/me takes it out.
lol
luna
:D
You're crazy. I went to sleep at 3 am
How about a war between spoons and chopsticks?
But if you want to just stay here passively... I guess that's also good...
after Alladin
you can't eat ice cream with chop sticks!
YES YOU CAN!
4Dee_Twenty: I played my KOTOR 2 without the mod...on the Xbox multiple times
i went for a bit after that yeah too

Not easily, anyway.
Aw, horseapples
I was able to turn my sister's pet unicorn against her friends that night. I sat by and watched the fireworks.

...WAIT!
OX is a nice area
Port Medow is awesome
I found it...
loaaads of tourists though
Now Painter itself is also full of bugs
It couldn't be any more simpler!
I've been out on it 3am lookign at stars and being befined by horses that scared the shit out of me
I hope we see more Fluttershychosis on se2 <3

yeah, that usually tends to be the case too
ugh
i want more caffine

4Maybe the way i was laying
=(
yeah of course
cool
But yeah
guys you know there's a whole channel just for roleplay, right?
Quite frankly, I enjoy my quiet nights on the roofs of Everfree Castle. I'd like them to stay that way.
it's in the topic
my gamertag is uklldknnyubstrd
yeah
cool got the request
but the massive ammount of talking is done
"Neigh at the moon" would also be acceptible :)
because we are the insomniacs
i have nothing else to do right onw
As I've said before, this is hardly roleplay
=(

it depends on how much typing experience you have too
and i've been drinking monster and vodka outta it
yeah isk
fun
idk even...
Is anyone else having issues?
I forgot there were even passwords on IRC, I haven't used it in years
I often just mix up keys due to typing too fast.
it's not case sensitive...right?
yeah i have
i am going to mix them soon to try the fluttershy one
I have no shot glasses as I need MONEY
i need to give some of them a try
I think it is.
:(
oh, look, there it goes
but i would have to buy various things
I heard the pinkie pie waS GOOD
Yeah it is.
Or at least, the password undoubtedly is.
capslock, woo.
hmm...I'll try again.
39 bucks was worth the 3 shot glasses

oooo...thats gotta hurt
lol
I was trying not to say anything bronyish lol
and yet, you did?
If I met my english teacher I woudl rub my publishedness in their face
well she's one of those no nonsense teachers

thats a bit close minded
english teachers suck

He probably does it for the lols.

=(
13Okay!

remember
Not *that* way, just likes unicorns best.
sorry :(
the other I had where cool
Except Rarity.
But Rarity's a self-absorbed, fussbudget bitch.
I thought of something productive to do
xP
I'm trying to start a ponyfic, but I can't seem to get the inspiration I need.
looking at the code for the first time in months
hmm
damn it I alt f4'd the wrong window
I don't feel like doing it anymore
:P
just a simple ice sliding puzzle
i would, but i suck at stories ='(
i've been looking for a reason to read a pony fic
Oh, cool.
I perfer writing OCs
it works just fine
there are just some changes I want to make
oh no, that suck
*sucks
Aaand I can already feel my mind slipping away from me. I'm gonna leave before I post something incredibly stupid. Goodnight.
hmm
do it!
but I think I need to fix some flaws with Oswald before I try that. He's a bit mary sue and I dont mean him to be
Hahaha
just the way he's writen make him seem to 2d
:P
Well, in a nutshell, it was medieval but with modern weapons. Took place after an apocalypse.
Hahaha, that's awesome.
4Almost got Spyro all leveled
yep
Looking for Jack Sparrow, no doubt.
I just found my first published work in an anthology of young writers work. I didn't know it had a quoat form Ian Macmillan on the back
:P
up is down
cool anyone else?
Which edition? I do both 3.5 and 4th.
Well, that's just maddeningly unhelpful.
was thinking doing 4th to make it easier
Doooo it.
(Would keep this Pirates quote going, but I've only seen the third one twice
*)
Haha, it's fine.
sure is...exciting here
Cya tomorrow!
gn
goodnight
gnight
lol misti

Never tried Savage World, it's a D20 system right?
http://i.imgur.com/iIXml.jpg
yup
yeah it is
13Alright!
I know
Shouldn't be too different from D&D then.
ya i was going to go with that or the 4.0 edition
still deciding
Kenan is kind of a dumbass, isnt he?
I like it.
Thanks
kinda the point x3
really
he's supposed to be
13Proud
You should put it up on Kongregate or something when it's finished.
Never watched the show
I think I've had too much coffee
besides dee
had 2 weeks to do it
Welp...that was stupid
and of course
eh, sure, why not?
maybe
waited til the last night
times would be an issue for me
:P Everyone does it.
does anyone know how to change thier IRC password?
one of the more fun all nighters I've had that was involving homework however
Wow, drawing a pony pic in 40 minutes is not easy, but then again I made it complicated
which is why I intend to keep working on it
gotta ask the nickserv
I've never heard of it before
I don't think I have asking Nickserve down
drawing ponies are easy, just gotta practice
it's complicated
cool
what's the challenge today?
island went down
draw a pony making something. I had me making an apple picker for applejack
woah
I'm a writefriend, though I haven't submitted anything to EQD yet. I'm waiting for sis to finish proofreading my story first.
cute!
awesome
lets go with the savage rules because thats more set up then D&D
that could be bad :P
I think I liked it too
making something? ur probably going to get alot of pinkie pie
do you guys need the link to the sheets?
4and it died at 201
and rules?
Ich
hehehe
It freezes because of all the ice cubes.,
fuck this torrent stuck at 99.8%
that does sound a bit daunting
That's a pretty tall order there rememberme.
alright hold on
Oh, anybody catch the 4chan news?
still its a huge EP dump soo i dont care too mcu
maybe start a...tensy bit smaller
nope.avi
and no it was not going to be on tonight,
Good luck if you really want to attempt it, but I would suggest starting with something of smaller scope.
just getting characters set up and such
they're in another civil war
I was of the impression that's their normal state of affairs.
i set high standerds but i may have a way to do it
oh another wooo
well it flared up again to the point they were down for a while
13Sora, Donald and Goofy are on level 63. Tron is at level 64
13 64's alright, but I plan to break a Level record while in SP
13The record is 86
Just made a Kongregate account
hi

that cover image is epic.

http://i.imgur.com/iIXml.jpg
4Wow

stars are much farther than the moon though.

let me see if i can't get the fillable sheets
XD
...Lol.
thanks!
:P
the level that I have right now isn't very hard
aww here we go
my friend made them all
http://img268.imageshack.us/img268/4980/snapshot20110618144918.png can anyone make sense of this?
Wait, wut?
I suck at making mazex
...
cool
Oh right.
She simply can't resist them.
NMM's sister = Celestia
It's supposed to be ponies building something
this was my maze, and it turned out to be pretty easy
Derpy-de-derp
Man, I feel like an idiot.
!*
Why am I still here?
I am doing fine Paint
http://giftkrieg23.deviantart.com/gallery/30436047#/d3d3nzh here go ahead and right click and download the sheets
Not really a positibe outcome.
4Why did I not post in color?
Because the power of Celestia compels you! :p
I've heard several names...
6COLOR!?
Outline: Unless you land in one, you would be burnt to nothing instantaneously.
0oh, i see
0it looks alot like Rampart
I don't know how to change it at the moment though
hmm
0or that
0that too
give him guns!
jk
::P
xD
Nah, a flamethrower.
Pretty much
XD
He'll melt those pesky cubes.
blah
I should make a flamethrower easter egg
snap
For a player though this should be all I need?
0and it updated...for some reason
but it just melts all the ice and you drown
pretty much
Magic...No need to explain.
Need? No. But they probably enjoy it.
Being able to breath IS nice, I'll admt..
admit*
Well, Celestia and Luna aren't the ones aiming for the stars.
Twilight?
Eos?
Nah, she doesn't explain magic
EOS!
i'll come back to it
trebbles x3
Hahaha, you should.
I hope it has nothing to do with the puppies
Or make it a powerup that allows you to burn one slide.
XD
lol
press p for pony mode
I'll do that
hehe
And that's the story of how Equestria was made...
Thank you.
sleep wellmib
But I think it involved more rocks.
it was fun
i have (maby) done it!
you need me at a latger date I'll dump my email. saundersmitchell@gmail.com
Hi

At least from Pinkie Pie's--yeah.

Speaking of the aforementioned 4-dimensional pony...
lol
0zsmith1744
Only 4 dimensions?
6...are there still ponies here? Oo
Hrm, have to download Skype, unless it can interact with MSN.
At all.
6I wasn't really watching, was busy in a GET battle.
well download it, its nice to just have
6That I just won by a single point.
congratz
4Awesome, Sprinks
sprinks play some kablam
does skype have a push to talk feature yet?
I'm just trying to chill down a bit
lame
13Re-mixing some music is a good idea
She had a squirrel between her teeth.
not yet x.x
it's called a mute button
0get a headset thta mutes
0my PSP had that
i have one but i don't feel like breaking the switch
0ya know, when skype on PSP was still a good idea
13And if I could, I'd do some walkthroughs for the first three games and ETD
Hey, squirrels are terrible
I had to take care of a baby squirrel once, and it was an abomination...
DON'TCHU BE DISSIN' THE SQUIRRELIES
oh well i'll just keep with vent and mumble @_@

Can't stand the connects/disconnects
Well, then again. Pinkemena took over at that time.
I'll unjupe it when I get it back online
Pinkie Pie was somewhere else...
There is. Unfortunately, the triggers are "Hair droopy, Angry feeling, allucination"
HAYO
Sick bastards.
Wut?
yeah, skype is a lot easier. besides vent tends to have static issues at times since you need a server for it

I noticed.
/me monologues like a boss.

4I get to fight him
Cats like me...they like seek me out....but I'm allergic.
I'm hiding in a dimensional rift, if you all want to die during a battle between two Nightmares, suit yourselves!
xD
Not evil enough.
13Cool~
okay
Diet coke of evil?
XD
4Color = purple
4Cynder=black but purple
/me does not compute
when you hit p, instead of saying "Quest for Booty... On Ice!"
13Okay!
=.=
4Used XD
XD
awesome this is going to be fun
13Music videos. There's plenty, but whole remixes are great!
xd
awkward
You know what's really seriously weird?
I'm used to having no money
XD
[00:21] <@Lambda> when you hit p, instead of saying "Quest for Booty... On Ice!"
Welcome to global economy of the present.
Ha
my connection died
xD
UPDATE!
But now that I have money I can just eat since I can buy food properly
Alright, all set.
4Hm
Money is a nice thing
And that's weird... because?
4Whats the deal with darkenss in this set of games?
Possibly.
!*
XD
that's awesome
4Cynders evil in the first got that
It's weird because I still have the whole "I'll just try to deal with it" thing going on in my head when I'm hungry as heck
But that's TrollHasbroia.
I need to learn to actually get up and go eat
How do you pronouce that?
I'm not gonna tell anyone but you about this change either
4And in the third they both have moments
13Darkness is evil
I didn't like it
xD
13That's right
Nothing wrong with it.
I excercise enough
eh, I'm not skinny or anything.
:P
I have a medical condition that requires me to eat something sugary every few hours
XD
13Darkness appears to be hate and rage
Jack Daniels?
I'll play it in that mode whenever it's done
Hahaha
Diabetes type (1 or 2 forget which)
added
installing skype
*?
4Right
But being hungry makes it really freaking difficult to work on any drawings or projects
hipoglicimc
Hypoglycemic actually
4But Cynder doesn't seem to hate
5 people :3
great turn out
its like bizarro diabetes.
4Spyro just got caught off guard
13She was controlled
I feel the urge to post a link to a certain drawing.
What's sugary enough? Tea with three spoonfuls?
But I'm worried about two things.
13it's mostly of negitve emotons
haha
....sorry
4Yea
I'll go kick myself now
One: It's on FurAffinity (which I'm part of (bite me if you will))
PFFFFFFFFFFFF
4I thought she had lost them and he does a trick and shes evil
I don't remember this episode xD
Huh? Have I met you before?
Do you go to MSPA forums?
Me?
You
I actually 't drink tea...I have never found a tea I like...
Nnnnooooo.
Hmm..
deviantArt?
4the chain
Have an account there, yes.
Oh well, what's the second point?
4It went poof and came back easy
unless you get the girly flavors. then you're a sissy.
4He didn't even touch it
Wut.
It's related to DarkMemories earlier sentence: "Don't get fat."
:3
that was my point...
Anything that's not "black" can be considered girly by some people xP
Hmm
peppermin Mocha Frappechino.
In regards to coffee.
There's another drawing too.
Nick was full of awesome at one point.
13So, in the KH series, she's pure evil
I need to get another pony on it sometime
yes
Two things really put me off in fanart
It ain't THAT creepy...
*gulp*
It's kinda like that...
Also, that is a great name for a pony...Peppermint Mocha....
13:/
:D
I just need to make a Derpy picture
HEY!
If this episode were on today there'd be people all up in arms about it encouraging homosexuality.
Anything that isn't based off of a traditional pony body is kinda weird to me, imo.
13Good and bad
Anthro? Yuck.
Are you implying something about Furries?
if you don't wanna make one I could try my hand at it
No, I'm just saying it's not my thing at all
But mixing features? Ugh, I don't like it.
4And i won without dieing
Sure!
13Cool!
Thanks
:D
13Yikes!
lmao yeah dumb america
But you're not bashing it, right>
?*
but still
4See in the cutscene it shows a whole world
D:
You're paranoid xD
alright
4Theres no way it was all done
Just overly sensitive...
should I make it with the same style as the pic you posted?
13*Gulp*
yeah that's fine
its all stupid here right now x.x
:P
silly america
With a bad temper
yeah, that would be nice
alright
I have no reason to bash things just because I don't find the concept attractive.
4More boss fight while we fall
4Reminds me of kh2
same here
still our polotics are LAME atm
XD
13Yeah, it does
That's a weird thing to ask
Maybe I shouldn't have said that...
But Anthros...I'm seasoned...I've seen it all...I'm no longer surprised
but there's a carnival in town I want to go to sometime tomorrow
haha
oh cool
...did they have to die all at once, or separately?
Just can't see the appeal.
D:
Society avoids me, despite it happening 6 years ago... It was ONE killing spree Illinois! ONE!
xD
xD
D:
yeah
Uh huh
wait... sweden, seriously?
Yeah.
that's the last place I'd think of that happening
http://cdn1.knowyourmeme.com/i/000/107/432/original/i_hug_that_feel.png?1300595876
Why would "furries" give a warning?
weird
Oh Celestia--what gingerale said.
well yeah I guess that might have something to do with it
Well, we don't want it to turn into pornagraphic discussion.
they have huge anit discrimation laws ect
I guess the mod thought things were going down a non PG road
Hang on.
but they GO TOO FAR
Because it's easy to go from Furry to Interent Rules.
Or anythign suggestive, for that matter.
I might go to a concert at the last minute tomorrow but it's not a sure thing
You can't discuss the pornographic side of everything.
Why is it that when sombody says furry, they instantly go to pornagraphic things?
But, enough on this.
somebody*
Oh that would be cool
its illegal to disagree about the holocaust to the point of saying that certain touted facts are illogical can get you arested.
The term is stained
who's concert is it?
Oh well
4The Queen
of corse
but if I go it's mainly just to see my friends, I have a couple of their albums though
because It's full of morons?
Yes.
I'm going to stop, yes.
one of my friends was talking about it, and it's her first time in the pit completely by herself since none of her other friends are coming
I was a moron once!
the creepiest people also seem to be the most vocal
Just going a little to in-depth on my reasons, sorry.
13She's not as evil as Lady Tremaine and her daughters, though
oh man
Oh cool
13Remember when they tried to murder Cindy?
I'm one of the quiet ones. They never expected me to kill...
that should be fun
yeah, if I get to go
Yeah.
yeah
Okay, I'm going to call it a night. Take care, all!
niight.
i added you Dee just letting you know
G'night mate.
they have bands at this carnival tomorrow too
Like drawing characters like that is fun, you can d alot of things with it...but then theres those really loud weird guys, that wear the suits...
the show's not too bad
And I'm gonna go eat cheesecake!
but you have to be 21 to go to the concert
do you know the names of any of them?
ahhhh
that sucks
i want cheescake.
because there's implied drinking involved
aye
Me too...
Oh!
My breakfast!
I forgot
/me is off
his last show here was 21+ too
4Yea
are you kidding
Oh yeah
I was wondering why he hadn't left earlier.
it's more than not too bad
and faster pussycat in july is 21+ but we might sit outside and listen for that one
I'm one of the quiet ones too
But I have military training
\o/
Breakfast?
I used to watch All That
Off again!

Oh wait.

Lol, insomnia is cereal business
I'm quiet, and have four swords, and 2 clubs stashed around my house
can you send those links again ruben?
Yeah, if that would work that would be cool
sure
I prefer knives of any kind.
on skype or here?
i know karate, kung fu and several other dangerous words.
Off once more!
xD
Any burgular that comes in here is going to get the broad side of a claymore
Lol
Slice, slice, cut, cut, slit, slit!
Can't wait to see that reaction.
I bought Amnesia.
I still haven't played it.
xD
I'm a wuss when it comes to horror games.
yeah and it's on a saturday
13Put all the villains you know into one, then times it by three. The trio are even more evil than all that
Probably be back here tomorrow too, or rather today since it's Saturday here. XD
I can't get enough horror film...
I labled one of the clubs "Stun" and the Machete "Kill"
faster pussycat was my first concert ever I was 8 years old
But I just can't do games.
doesnt matter
4Almost killed him
Yeah, that would be really cool
4Just missed a button
MAKE US WHOLE!
Lol
Oh
Danit
Breakfast
13Okay
*darnit
Off agaiiiiiin!
I think that's cool that you've been going to shows since you were
8
oops
stupid enter key
STEP THREE!!
Cross my heart and hope to die...
4I would, but sadly, I'm sleepy as shit
/me sticks his arm out, and turns it
4God he doesn't die even when you hit beat him twice
4I appreciate the offer, though
/me then takes his hand, puts it in his mouth, and gulps
yeahh
13I'll say
Darnit, where is that shirt of miiine? Got to get dressed properly finally. (Past 10 am) :I
/me puts an arm within the outline
done with the rough draft of my fanfic here is it any good https://docs.google.com/document/d/11_ETMXlvbZCATU4Nawn-WEigPcCQfDAVg_AXstXMelc/edit?authkey=CMPz3ugC&hl=en_US

Forcing schizophrenia on yourself isn't easy...
oh hey
Gives me someone to talk to.
XD that's awesome
Never thought about that.
4I need to fury the third part
4Fury!!!
But, I AM demented after all...
Oh man, I broke prime directive...I wasn't supposed to tell you that.
Reverse psychology.
6What's going on now?
I hate thinking of ideas that sound like they came from a stoners mouth.
Which is why I contradict and plan EVERYTHING I say...
6...YES
we are just getting contacts out of the way and plesentries
good :3
Wait, are you implying that I'm on drugs?
cool
I think I was implying I'm on drugs
which I'm not
hai
but I often sound like it
13I'm sick of having to repeat the story for Agrabah, Wonderland and Olympus Coliseum in THREE games
sooo twitchy :P
Caffeinne is a drug.
4RainBroDash, seemingly awakening from idleness
4Ah
don't be hatin' now
It makes you think, "Wow. I wish I really was that guy..."
:D
<3
4Even if it does suck :P
:P
hmm
It means you have an extreme ego, I know that much.
4wow
6...skype...that might be an issue.
6I have to check and see if it's blocked.
Well, I didn't want to start a dialogue about
it
welcome to Rule 63.
workin on the derpy eyes though
I didn't know...at the time, this was years ago
Okay, no more on this I suppose.
4i got two of the Achievements for one go
Oh my Celestia it never stops...
I was merely giving an example.
4Beating his lair and beating him with out dieing
4 32/50
I talk far too much here.

i concor
haha, nice. I was thinking clouds maybe
My self would kill me online...
13Cool!
4Wow
probably stupid though
This hasn't gone unnoticed Balloons :P
xD
13Wow!
why woudl they block skype
DarkMemories. My twin.
Hahaha
xD
6Cafe
or just Pinkie Pie making an evil face
6It's not blocked.
XDDD
awesome
6But some of the most RANDOM things are blocked.
I'll do balloons
I like that idea
I would live in the one that's exactly like this one, only Billy Mays didn't die
lol
Only IRL.
I was kidding but that could work :P
thats the kind of answer I like to hear.
:P
13Sweet!
I flip and flop between misanthropicness...
4Nice world is saved
xP
Like children
I hate children
its frezzeing in the frezzer OMFG
wtf is that place
/me works with children
13That's right!
of Souldead...miserable people...
4Dragon is stars looks nice
walking meatsacks with moutholes, with little failure trails behind them...
@ Paintsplash, I'd probably head to a universe where the technology to freely travel between these universes had been developed, and the people were responsible enough to refrain from abusing it.
DarkMemories: You're hanging out with the wrong people IRL.
13Hm
I mean, my roommates are kind of anti-pony.
I want to kick my siblings' in the teeth every single time I see or hear their voices...
I mean, I don't get a choice.
13Yes, you sure do
But they're not going to get on my case for it.
Outline, I'd go the same way pretty much...the ability to visit ther unvierses in said universe is sort of the "infinite wishing" rule.
4I still think my plot idea would tie it all in
Oh I hate my family...
13True
And I met them on the internets.
actually, I feel nothing...I'd say thats worse
what's this you guys be up to?
oh, D&D?
cause at least if you feel...you care.
4Hm
4Thats a tuff one
They drive me to drink.
A world where communism works.
4They are all good
http://i248.photobucket.com/albums/gg185/Aicebo/derpy.png

13They are all good!
Can you down 6 bottles of vodka and stay sober?
Hahaha, no that's good, I'll use it
13That's right!

It's fun and easy.

For once, I lol'd.

Also, drink.
BEER IS GOOD.
13What about in the KH series
LET'S GO DRINK SOME BEEEEERRRRR!!!

CroupDockHaunch: I've had apfelwein in a fermenter for, uh

Getting close to a year now. I should probably drink that.

mhm
Thoguh also secondary in Euphonium/Baritone, Tuba, and Piano
And tequila.
Acoustic...
Like a monarch
@DarkMemories: Is it foolhardy to try to teach oneself a brass instrument?
Not any moreso than... Well, any other instrument.
[!Isukra vars reset]
I'm self teaching myself Cello.
It's going quite roughly to say the least xD
I know how to play just about everything on earth you don't have to blow into
Not a cello
F*CK
(thankfully I didn't have a meeting that morning)
Back to fics...
Why is it that 80% of RD fics have her falling from the sky?
Fanon?
It's easy drama
How does the trixe/twilight pairing work out?
It's hawt.
Twixie is my favourite pairing
i hear its for comedy
But it's cute.
I hear a skype
I'm not sure how to phrase the rest
They're sort of doppelganger versions of each other

@PaintSplash: Already doing that with the female CMC, I'm sure they don't want to do it with another group, especially one not beneficial to a young female audience.
/me hugs all
Hmm..
12hi
Fluttershy can't NOT be in an episode.
cool, skype is fun

^----
Greetings Everypony
I can do treble, but it starts getting a little to falsetto
..am i the only one that has tiramisù for breakfast?
Exactly.
Let's just say...
xD
Sort of been rickrolled...I think
Well, it's not my fault you thought of it
when I hear his name, I think the song...therefor you got me
You didn't have to think about Never gonna Give You Up
Now, seriously
03o.o
Yes.
I was born the year Never gonna give you up was top of the charts....
crap
xD
I forgot how to change the hostname
At least that was when pop was good
POST
Music is unfortunate now
Well, sorta, as good as pop could be
We're talking about music?
Yes, quite.
And... yes, quite.
we just got there
But it faile.d
No miserably, but if failed.
aww
Todays music is not BAD... I enjoy some
But nothing is GREAT
Still: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEbFXzZiuG8
This is going to happen.
Volbeat is GREAT
And it's today's music
I would totally perform that live
xD
My pitch sucks when I have allergies, like right now
but I'm quite good after clearing my throat and warming up xP
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEN3mQ0ql30 <3
heh, Volbeat.
See?
I was my friends rockband frontman....I was the best singer out of 10 people...plus I was bad with the instruments.
Today's music and it's great
ohsi
ohai*
hi
I got a woman's deodorant commercial.
!fight lightumbreon|mibbit
!chatstats
xP
But
12OMG that took AGES >v>
Volbeat is mainstream
... since when?
I don't think they play that on 106
This is the first time I've heard this song
12I had to clean it all up first
I am kinda sick of music for the most pasrt
part
Since they got sold out whenever they play live?
I like instrumental music
And I pop between, uh...
And J-Pop, but that's a different xtory from my weaboo times xD
lol
Five or six stations when I'm driving
The deodorant thing
Before the YT vid of that song.
lmfao
It's plenty sure music
probably not as bad as mine
Give me either good vocals or *really* good instrumentals and I'm in.
It's hella good instrumental music.
lol
I loves me a Dream Theater.
Wut?
Unless it's not from the games.
Dream Theater <3
it's not from the games.
I know...I know, Heresy
The anime?

Oh yeah
And good music

Right here downtown
I doubt I could beat that
But I have... all of.. the YTMND soundtrack?
and I am nerd shamed
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3UT8bfp0ow
I have a shit tonne of Powerpuff Girls music on my phone
That's pretty cool
oh my, i was beaten hard
And then http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pKByy53JY
argh damnit, this thing is making me set up IPv6
/me bawwwwwwwwwws
But I listen to Six Degrees more
(like every day)
That live performance is absolutely *spectacular*
yea
Hah
I know, man
(the suite, anyway)
I have the album
Well, while I'm still thinking about BGM, I gotta say that these two BGMs are among my favorites of all time:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNvHGXbdO5I http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfgZOTuu6J0
Funnily enough
Good, just checking ;)
The Record I'm listening to now
I went to go looking for Dream Theater Vinyls today
haha
Where it was just him singing and playing piano (and his samples)
Cool man
Nothing beats Propaganda from Beyond Good & Evil
ù_U
Lemme put that up...
But I admit
I haven't made it around all their albums yet
They have like
9001 hours of music
I calculated their average song length
nice :3
It was narly 9 minutes e_e
heya
Even without Six Degrees on Score
Hey
Oh, and the demo for "A Change of Seasons" (which was originally supposed to be on Images and Words)? Beautiful.
Hahahahahahahaa, I hadn't seen this one before xD http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/25312
That was while they were auditioning other singers.
lol
@PaintSplash: Yeah, same.
Anyone home?
Plus most of the characters were cnsistently unlikeable
Man
xD
I heard about it first when that film came out
Welcome back to Pocahontas
I need to watch it; it's supposed to be good
I hated Avatar.
But then I find it it's like... a comic...
But it's drawn like a web comic
I don't even
it's always such a pain
I liked the visuals and concepts in that regard.
Only thing it's good at is the 3D.
gtfo
I kid
But seriously
*soul
lalalaalaa
Films today are generally boring
In idea
They are quite watchable
I can't wear 3d specs...I get sick
yes
12Why? ovO
yeah
whats up
all 2 of you
But they're entertaining at least.
Unlike most other things.
xP
nothing much
3d is such a gimmick and I continue to boycott it
Well, I have to go for a week.
Watching boast busters
Goodbye, everypony!
I like Avatar, it was really pretty; but it was just a closetFur plot
:D
Really quiet. You have to crank it up.
Bye DarkMemories ;_;
xP

But one of the most obscure, and maybe one of the most haunting DT tracks you'll ever hear.

03want these ones then? They sound like a roaring engine
12probably because they drowned out all the noise my parents used to make past 11pm >v>
12Nah, I don't keep my computer in my room anymore
12Ascendant, no
I can't say that makes it right
But it's wrong to expert quality from anything
that pretty much says it all
You can't have depth in this economy!

This is a controversial film for some reason

The comics are weird; man
12how often can you do it
It's like a webcomic
But published to paper for some reason
Yep.
-has a problem with this-
I like Comic stories...but I can't comment on Pilgrim...
I never read the books...
Don't really want too though
whatevs.
I also swear it's not native and it's being tunnelled through he.net, but maybe I'm just doing it wrong
sooo
Once a week (with cards) and free rebirth at the age of 21
how's everyone doing?

Not that I know of.
Lots of really limited CD releases.

Hating Twilight means that you're sane.
Book or pony?
lol
Have you seen the movie Vampires Suck?
No.
It makes fun out of the Twilight series, and has vampires speeding around on Segways.
I can't say I've watched Twilight
Nothing can be that good; but I can't really comment on it until then
peabnuts: keep it that way.
Not even FiM is THAT GOOD.
I have at least 2 of the films on my Hard Drive
You should watch Vampires SUck
Maybe one day I'll see them

oh crap

oh and it's debian, need to install build-essentials too

No I disagree
I can't prove anything to be impossible... well. very little.
you*
but there are too many variables, in a situation like that, i would act like the church did all those years
or at least say it's faulty
:3
that worked for 2000 years, why would it work now?
well, what's changed?
Still
There aren't that many variables
pony rights activists? Moon. Pony rebeliion? Moon. Sister trying to make the world into eternal night? Moon.
as there would be a way to run away
ugh, darnit
I forgoti had thisplace upagain

Hey
and hi Coz
I just lurk on this
oh
what's this
An abridged episode
oh my.
More importantly, is it a /good/ abridged episode?
Yet to see one
It's amazing

on here
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/06/friendship-is-witchcraft-lucky-number.html
That's one good thing.
lol
"We just watched Gremlins and an episode of Star Trek and went straight to bed!"
That was really good
Fortenheit 451
Lol
Pinkie- check out har far I can slide!
how *
A lot of the voices don't really work.
They're good enough
It's all done by one girl, lol
excpet for
2 people
That
And he did an episode
But it was a different kind of humour
This was probably the best Abridged episode I've seen
I remember that.
It's the only one that actually made me laugh out loud.
Hahaha
I
EV-ERY-THIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIN

bawww

HAHA; balls.
okay island is back up
a phineas and ferb cover?
asiodguyhjaskld;
wtf i hate phineas and ferb
do not mention that show
Dude
That show is awesome.
What's bad about it?
regardless
are amazing
http://www.youtube.com/user/Arraitchgee
idk it just bothers me that much
it relies on the jokes and not the actual character developement
Alright. I've never seen.
seen it*
And they have ridiculously quality music
ok i admit their music is decent
/me likes Phineas & Ferb.
check it out
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwf86ndqsBs&feature=channel_video_title
but that platypus
lol
Perry
i just don't get it
Lol
It's just lolrandom
yeah that's the word
too random
Not pinkie random
/me points at the infinitely brighter light of ponies.
the crap on TV now
if i ever see another unoriginal drama/action tv show, i'll barf
or another pointless and unfunny cartoon
I have to admit
I can watch it
yeah TV has that effect
lol
isn't something you really even think about. you just... watch it
Ren and Stimpy, anyone?
yes
that and Dexter's Lab
I only saw one episode of Dexter's Lab. It was hilarious.
Dexter's Lab was amazing
Totally
Wow
Did you see that Celestia cosplay on ED?
yeah i saw.
man she's beautiful
next up, Luna
That is amazing
*munch*
i just had an idea
and add RD's cutiemark on it
wooooo
Totally
Man
Do it
yeah i saved it
it was my display pic for a while now
But they are impossible to play -_-
BUT IT'D BE WORTH IT
yeah the shape is for show off-y reasons
i'd rather play my SG
It's a cool shape but
I don't want to ALWAYS STAND UP while playing
Um
Okay; you know explorers?
or... X-plorer or W/E...
yeah i know the explorer
well dayum
But I have a really nice acoustic guitar
semi-acoustic
and also a cheap acoustic guitar
My instrument collection is; erratic at best
Epiphone SG Special guitar, Semi Acoustic APX guitar, and a nylon guitar
Nice, guys xD
My semi-acoustic is Ibanez
http://www.dv247.com/assets/products/38277_l.jpg <This one
both acoustics and semi acoustics i own is Yamaha loo
nice 8)
lol*
lol xD
MTM2 Mick Thompson Signature!
That looks similar to mine.
dat head
I play Bass, too
400 off
But my bass is... not mine ... ?
It's technically my friend's
lawl
I also play bass
me too
but not really professionally.
learning guitar means knowing somewhat how to play the bass. the fretting hand at least
Totally
Does anyone have a seven-string guitar?
Pssh
no, lol
nah
dads
but I played one in the shope
BC Rich guitars are good
but mostly for show
Egh those are nice but... I don't like metally shapes
Not even
It's totally 16.6 percent cooler
lackluster
Yeah its overly metal!
I don't like them lol
I did not know this;
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twist_tie
http://profile.ultimate-guitar.com/profile_mojo_data/6/1/0/1/610178/pics/_c728831_image_0.jpg
my guitar
But they color code bread bags with the appropriate date the bread was baked
Oh
for example, if the bread was baked on monday, they'd use a blue twist tie
imagine that guitar light blue instead
this guitar is awesomez > http://www.espguitars.com/guitars/signature/esp-truckster.html
I know that; but in NZ they don't use twist-ties on bread...
ESP guitars are nice
yea
we have
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread_clip
bread clip wat?
oh they use those here sometimes as well
They are great projectiles

Does Equestria have a flag? Is there anything from the show or fanon?
Yea
Link please <3
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/06/equestria-flags-event-post.html
ten seconds flat.
i should learn some pony songs...
Hmmmm
None of them is really a simple flag
My Little Pony METAL!
Lol
I was figuring out Winter Wrap up
I swear
that is like
50 guitars
It's too complex
i make tabs :D
I managed to transcribe the beginning up until "Winter wrap up..." and was like WE'RE DONE HERE
There is a WHOLE WEBSITE for guitar tabs and sheet music
Everypony Sings
yep I submitted tabs for CMC theme song over there
I'll just have to design my own flag for Equestria when the time comes
That's the one
http://www.everyponysings.com/
Oh ...
I've seen more too
Boy do I feel silly.
lolcats :p
Thank you.
make sure to comment on my tabs >:O
I figured out the lead guitar bits to CMC when they were doing that sing-along on Ponychan
But the project got weird, and I didn't submit
yeah it's actually pretty hard
the opening solo at least
Eb, man?
Yeah.
you mean the tuning?
Why?
Eb is the tuning for CMC theme song.
i mean, half step down
how do you figure that
worked perfectly
speakingof music, i should play the piano.
Hmm
you should. if my parents didn't force me to play piano, i wouldn't give two shits about music
I can't play piano
Oh I used to play keyboard when I was much younger but forgot ALL of it
I can play a few things on keyboard
i only remember the mortal kombat theme song on piano now
hahaha
and to think i could've played Fur Elise before
That's enough.
wow
like i said, i played for a long time
That must've beenweird having to be forced to play an instrument
well if you're asian, then no not really that weird
Lol xD
Asian parents HAVE to teach their kids musical instruments
i honestly don't know why
hmm
I learned all the instruments i know by myself
Same here
Well
yeah me too, except piano
drums, guitar, all that crap
But I played a lot of instruments when I was earlier
by myelf
lmfao yep
Cool.
Same here, man
i got 2nd D:
d'aw lol
oh nice whath kinda peab!
that makes sense shaico
t
XM Drums
he was 25, i was 15
lolo
I did a drum competition when i was 12 and got 2nd lol.
It's taiwanese or something
iz good
I figured it would be good for learning on
and quiet
wow 12 and 2nd place in a competition is quite impressive
likewise for 15 lol.
It was guitar center's drumoff at any rate
for me, it was my school's drum off
oh wait
sorry it was just a drum competition
oh okay
i'm mixing it with my school's talent show, for which I got second place also
damn that ventriloquist.
whoah
maybe i just said it in my head.
I just play music in my room, lawl
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7grA1jnsLKQ
I don't have any friends close enough at a similar skill level
i do it in my music room
awh i know that feel pea!
in fact i had a band once
oh that's brilliant
I had a band with my friends in 9th grade with originals and such. we were a metal band lol.
I play the intro an octave higher than you
lol wow
aw :(
Lol
lol
she loves music. just different tastes than mine
Classical music lover
with a classical guitar?
I don't have a classical ;_;
d'aw lol
lol
I'm not sure a classical would sound that good with the idea anwyway
Both my acoustics are steel string :p
oh lol
i learned the guitar using nylon
then went on to semi
but it was good to learn on though
Makes you a MAN
lol
awesome xD
but nylon bends really easy
I had my friend's classical for a while, once
It was REALLY CRAP
But it sounded _amazing_
yeah nylons are great for that acoustic guitar solo.
e_e
the only song that I can name that has an acoustic guitar solo is....
uh
Dream Theater
Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence
Part.. 7 or something
Dream Theater does that also?
nice
solitary shell is the one you're talking bout <.<
You're talking about Solitary Shell.
Yea man
i know the keyboard parts to it lol
It uses a 12-string.
It's like
The best sounding guitar
i don't really listen to Dream Theatre much
EVER
not into prog metal
of that song?
Of... like the "whole" song
pretty much everything of it with a half assed piano solo
The intro bit
I <3 that
Hmm
I tried to learn it a few years ago, I have the sheet music to it lol
I can play the guitar intro? Lol
like, drop D and going up and down the neck
Lol
Dropped tuning
yep
but it's still damn good
It's awesome lol
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17mD4reFUlw
drop D song
I want to hear it when you're done, peabnuts.
Thanks
It's a few years off
lol
I'm not surprised.
I think one of the least metal Dropped D songs I know is Everlong
Everlong - Foo Fighters?
Yea
that's drop D? lol
the more you know
I'm a sucky guitarist, but I always want to try playing Dream Theater.
It's a curse.
Eh
that's how i was evolution
It's a learning process
I've been learning Rush's YYZ on Bass for like
3 years now
and I've only been played 3 years, lol
tbh i just picked up the guitar and start practicing dt crap the best i could. i'll get it eventually lmao
yeah i'm not even that good at guitar yet
It's legit
DT is the reason I got a seven-string.
Yea
the hardest i can play right now is Bohemian Rhapsody solo
I wanted to play the intro to A Change of Seasons.
Glass Prison e_e
lolglassprison
Glass Prison is a good song
I know.
ee
It's one of my favourites.
Just the difficulty ...
Lol
Everything is that hard, man
Yep.
I want to learn riffs from songs like the beginning of Great Debate
I'm going to learn them to spite you.
And that's like
i can't keep up with this dream theatre talk D:
lolcats
oh gawd
lolwtf
I am ashamed I have not made it to that album yet
Aw
Like I said before
DT has like
9001 hours of muisc
music
Scenes From a Memory is one of their best.
that's the only song I know from DT
It's my favourite album actually.
fine
*puts it on*
My favourite song from it is probably Home.
Typical Dream Theater
none of this "okay; this is pretty cool.."
:D
i actually had that feel with octavarium..it was my first album from them i got
and it was an okay this is pretty cool. whoah why did they not play 4\4 there.
And I listened to it like
oh snap
Lol
heaps
I'm ashamed to say Pull Me Under was the first song I heard of theirs.
On Guitar Hero ...
d'aw
dat overture 1928
Probably my favourite song by DT
Well, fav is pretty... redundant
My currently most enjoyed is prolly something like
War inside my head? or something
Actually I've had a hungering from These Walls lately
in the chorus?
Yea
or Great Debate
that was the first song where i was like
wtf time signatures
I've stopped listening to that all the time now though
TEAR DOWN THIS WALL.
uh
*looks up spelling*
Erotomania
Erotomania is like erotica to my ears.
LOL
I guess that's the point e_e
Oh gosh.I got to see dream theater live and they did that song and they messed up
Hah.
Can you really blame them?
I really want to see them live.
nopey dopey lol.
Hopefully they'll be coming to Australia sometime soon.
Dream Theater is on my (extensive) list of "Awesome bands that played here before I found them"
I feel for you.
But I sort of; don't get excited over gigs for some reason
I mean
I enjoy them
and I imagine them being fun
But when they come around i'm always just like "meh"
like disturbed WAS on that list but they played here again recently
and I didn't go
Just because
And metallica even played
I have the hair for headbanging in a mosh, but I never do it.
But I kinda just, cbf
Hmmm
I knew that long ago. :p
*out of the loop* ..portnoy...?
I didn't ;_;
LOL
*buck
no*
he left the band.
;_;
He wanted to take a break.
No one agreed.
But I shit dicks evvery day listening to him
Well he deserves a break, man
yeah you're right.

I'm trying to find the actual post on his forum.

That is four sides on it's own.
And Metallica's S&M is 6 sides

Gah, Portnoy must have removed the post from his site.

st angers sucks.
just saiyin
It's different
no doubt about it
hey
i've listened to them for too long
you certainly can
I am just back on them
In a casual kind of way
8Hi
Not listening to them hardcore
metallica's in my top 15 favourite artist/bands
But if they come on I fucking Jam

top goes to daft punk
eh
I'm a tad bit early. lol
http://myfacewhen.com/thumbs/tn_36.jpg

<3 Primus
actually tbh, i dont respect any band
Primus is meh
It's easy to hate primus
They play such weird music.
I missed those two because I went to Dairy Queen last night at around 7 PM
But Les' Bass lines make me jizz
He's just... really good at bass
Star- something
Primus is not about being weird
Primus ARE weird

Seriously. He's talented
2 is Saltakrits
daft punk

Gonna be 23 this October

Hi celestia
Booty Wars
Plot Wars
I mean
hehe
Do eeet!
It'd be a good learn for netcode
Come on I'll make the room in Booty Wars
I've never dabbled
durrr :(
I closed it because it had a tutorial
e_e
well just skip it
There's a lot I want to do, but I dont because of laziness and because I'm not already good at them. Durrrr
it's pretty simple
It took too long
Booty Wars doesn't sound too fun anyway.
Try it any evo
It kinda doesn't.
It has nothing to do with Booty
at all
Play it for the plot
Then i'm not interested
My brain was on derp mpode all day
*mode
Which booty are we talking about?
mine
lots of lol to be ha

Pearly's booty?

Thiiiiiiis is wiiiiiiiiiiine!
here comes another chinese earthquake
i still learning photoshop! I selcet all the lines, i have not really tried strokes!
brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
I dunno Celestia; I just look for artists on IRC when I see them
Stroke is
Disappointing
Its take about half an hour when i do it...
And everything is the same width
Unless you use similate pen pressure
simulate*
Yea but...
yeah to match the still of width of the show
How do with Stroke... e_e
Huh.
;o
I made THIS with Pen tool and stroke
http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v41/peabnuts123/Twilight_Running.gif

I'm not talented enough to draw properly =D
Hmm
http://i.imgur.com/jJMLJ.png
Me neither
thats the best i can do
oh man
I can draw ponies - in a standing upright position
I wish I knew more about coloring..
And I can draw them pretty well; but THAT'S IT
i suck at drawing
really suck
I think I would like to try a tablet
And then, one last nickchange.
I feel my drawing skills would improve vastly
!todo list
Yesssss.
the thing that bothers me is the head shape
i can't draw head shapes at ALL
http://img9.imageshack.us/img9/8977/rbdyo.png
Their head shape is a circle...
I just used the pony generator, Evo
aww ^_^
http://i.imgur.com/jJMLJ.png is the best i can do, but that's derpy
I found out about the pony generator afterwards.
i can't draw circles
Maeni
That's awesome
Not to mention how i messed up Lilpip
I still try to draw ponies though.
thanks :3
I spent time looking at a still picture of them
and copying it down
and just memorising all their details
i want to learn how to draw pony
Hm ...
and nopony thinks my derpy is any good\
:(
not even a comment
not a sausage
I totally commented on it
I- i ..!
Oh
I forgot to relate my comment
I said I could draw them standing
But forgot to say
It's just the shapes in the body that are off~
yeah i dont like strokes... just tried it
my animation was just a trace from the show :p
It didn't require any artistic skill
and
midnightshadow
i'll brb, going out to eat with the rents
It is a really good story
like, really.
While not very Pony, I think the style on derpy's head is cool
I'll go read it.
yeah, its kind of halfway between male and female, isnt it?
And of course, work on coloring, those damn colors *angerfist*
ugh, yeah, i SUCK at colouring
lolcats
Hahaha, Eee-nope.
ultimately
maybe my colouring ruined it
drawing is just for fun
oi!
Hahaha
yeah, caramels not allowed to help build bigmacs house of cards
!!!
AWESOME!
thats...pretty good!
=D
She's not impressed

srsly pen tool everwhere.
i have gimp
(and twilight's)
LOL my first attempt with pen tool http://blowingbomb.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d3gn9al
You just have to befriend pen tool
does it smooth out jitters of the strokes?
You don't draw with it
You click point
vertices
:O
and it interpolates between them
ohhhhhhhh
yep
well fuck me again
go away ;_;
i'll see if I can get the handle on that
...
you're too good :(
It's REALLY WEIRD
But you get used to it
DAYUM you're good
and you learn how it fits together
That looks exactly like the show

otherwise, really really good

You nailed her tail
dawwwww
Sooo..
Well we haven't left yet
Just draw for the fun of it
But i'm picking up a job application at some pizza place
the yellow line that forms her plot, when it hits her hair, I can spot some eraser tool ;]
Anyways~
what's a plot?
Here is my first attempt at drawing ponies on paper every and that sucked http://blowingbomb.deviantart.com/gallery/30029013#/d3eb4c1
Huzzah, all.
You mean 'before watching MLP'.
Aye
Plot
lol celestia. the squigglies under her make her look like
plot = I watch it for the "plot"
oh that plot
http://s1223.photobucket.com/albums/dd502/Immortalshippo/?action=view&current=Pony11001.jpg
That's like my first pony except
Oh :(
I only did the guide circles because of the drawing guides
Hai lucas.
my first pony was that rbdyo.png lol.
*Lucas
yeah i do the circles
I read up lots of them before even trying
They helped a lot
http://blowingbomb.deviantart.com/gallery/30029013#/d3em6g5
I don't do the guide circles, lol.
:D
I read it in Ron Perlman's voice.
Damn you, vectors.
wow not bad celestia
Vectors!
Vectooooooors!!!
I havve to pay my cousin for vectors.
I drew a Luna for today's training ground. it's terrible xP
i do vectors for free i took a few requests recently
Primarily because I don't own anything beyond MS Paint.
http://img850.imageshack.us/img850/4290/abandonedponies.jpg these two were some of my first few ponies I drew
This makes me sad.
All vectoring is is just cropping out a pony right? but to like, the finest degree
Aka before I saw all those shape guides
i drew this for i think the 3rd training grounds http://blowingbomb.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d3gslvx
Cute :3
Bonjour!
Hello.
Vectoring is drawing with vector-based shapes
Hekki Flamester
hay?
What's a vector based shape?
That's adorable.
try wikipedia if you want to no http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics
oh wow
that's neat
Vectors are made out of pure
MATHEMATICS
Looks like Illustrator.
I have been using photoshop... not exactly a vector
interesting
okay, tell a lie. THIS is my first pony.
http://i.imgur.com/c9SVP.jpg
Lol maeni you made me giggle
:D
oh....
Mission accomplished
oh, nice.
They are cool
But really, you should use Illustrator for vectors.
I dont know why people use photoshop for them.
i cant get used to illustrator... the tools dont work right...
Hello again.
Photoshop works for everything
can only see mind
I tried using inkscape
also i would then need to but Illustrator!
buy
They are different
It's easy enough to copy someone's style
I draw ponies, but they turn out like this.
http://s1223.photobucket.com/albums/dd502/Immortalshippo/?action=view&current=Pony11001.jpg
I havent drawn a pony.
yet.
I pony pony pony
I just photo'd my pony drawings
anyone? helpme?
How am I even supposed to vector that?
.. Hey, I actually like that style

If she does have that why do ti in front of everyone?
It's still fillyslaughter
8Spider's Web: A Pig's Tale
It's illogical.
Celestia, stop.
HMMF
*teleports*
No banishing, until we have discussed.
*teleports back*
If she wasn't guilty then why does she keep teleporting??
Oh. Yeah I remember it being something I've never heard of
/me plays with Light's tail
Reidculous
It's basically a ripoff of Charlotte's web.
ANyway
Look.
You're the ruler.
This isn't a trial
ohshit
Celestia has ultimate power
*raises hoof*
8a really, really bad, low budget rip off
I disagree.
*points at Lucas*
And since this is a biarchy, this is kind of normla for people to be afraid of you..
Well Oviously... Oh it was Lucas???
/me watches :3
No It was Rainbow Dash
No.
we're in for some fun then
No It wasn't me.
I saw her do it
I'm saying HE has the ultimate power.
In this case.
no
he
does
not
Yess.
He.
Does.
just
going
to

Fact of the matter is
banishment
We have a body on our hands
*teleports*
and somebody is going down for it
*teleports*
Alright someoen is gonna get banished!
Why not Celestia?
And..
*moment of truth*
SHE is supposed to PROTECT ponies from mares like me.
Did it work?
If PEABLES is correct, then no!
Banishing me would put a word on YOU!
as a fair and decent ruler.
Really? *sarcastic* OH NOES!
lol
She is UPHOLDING the law!
Lolyeah.
Upholding?
Pfft.
Wait.
lol hai murasaki!
8its a horrible, godawful movie with no cinematic value whatsoever
Right.
Hey
Omg, I just had this incredibly far out dream that I need to tell you guys
Guys
You were with here at the time!
...
GUYS
Look.
In my dream I got to see a sneak preview of the next season of FiM
Biarchy, people tends to be afraid of kings and queens
Ok?
And the episode was about rainbow dash and her real origins
And that's normal here...
Uh huh *listening to Avian*
I know that this is most likely not going to be 100% real but it seemed real to me
ocrapI'mnotgonnareadthatfic.
*sigh*
thats IT, I QUIT. I AM RETIRING!
with Apple Bloom!
She can't have sole decision..
You also found out that Rainbow Dash is only really half Pegasis
Celestia is banishing HERSELF!
since it's a biarchy
Really?
Cool.
lol wut
I get the palace.
Peab, pausing Scoot's revival is menaningless now..
I WIN!
Oh SHI-
Aww.
THat was in my dream though
*Lucas uses Lifenoodles*
That's pretty far out
Avian
But it seemed like I was watching the real show

Anyway the episode ended sadly though
Yes peabnuts?
Sorry i meant to add Avian to the end of my sentance but forgot
*breaks through and breaks Peab's pause effect*
8never heard of it
I have overthrown Tailight!
Avian, how would that even WORK? I mean, ADOPTION? In a CHILDREN'S SHOW?
Apple Bloom is adopted!
...
Interesting start...
*Lucas uses Lifenoodles and it works! COMPLETELY on Scoot!*
Anyway, at the end of the episode the entire village is swallowed up by mudslide killing everyone except Rainbow Dash

Whatever.
Um, walk downstairs.
Well, it was low budget
Please.
she was goona kill Dash Rainbow!
lol, Spider's Web doesn't even have a movie poster.

Would random acts of violance count as evil, y'all?
yes
Oh, well. I'm always free for helping the undead fill their evil quotas.
DOWNSTAIRS
Now
Later, Lucas.
Well, as this one hero said before I struck him down... "In the name of meaningless battle!"
*Stabs Derpy*

That was evil, right?
Consarnit.
*regenerates*
*takes Derpy by the neck and dissapears*
I suppose attacking an immortal is still an evil act. Foolish or not.

*comes back* hello
That was the moon, heh heh.
that was fun!
What'd sis call it?
Irony/
*derp*
*dink*
*shoves Derpy to the moon again*
O:
Well then, Spider's Web is a parody. Nothing more, nothing less
*telesports back*
*Stabs Dinky*
And if done right, parodies can be excellent movies all their own
Does this happen all the time, here? ...
silly
....
she is my daughter
and the heir to the throne
Consarnit, dag-nabit, dangit.
8no, its pretty much a straight rip off
stabes apple bloom*
then it's a Knockbuster
8yeah, more or less
A Mockbuster can be termed as a parody. a Knockbuster is a simple rip off
i dunno i just got here
Which onslaught?
Sorry applebloom
Movies like Spaceballs and Young Frankenstein are parodies.
This looks....ugh.
I can't even watch the trailer for it.
*wiping coat*
Derpy and Appleblooms
I can't even take it off ta wash it.
Maybe they could have made it into a parody with more effore
effort*
tell you*
That's how they work, like Transmorphers, and Land That Time Forgot
You killed the element of Honesty? I don't believe you, nothing can kill the element of Honesty, she's practically a mortal goddess!
But not immortal, I suppose.
[[ Bitch be strong yo ]]

It's got a 0% on Rotten Tomatoes
GRR, YOU KILLED APPLEJACK AND MADE MY INTERNETS DIE!
She didn't need to because Celestia did.

Probably had to be to get him to stay there.
You need to stop living in the past
and get over it
I TAKE OVER.
MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

I'm going to engage an EPIC BATTLE with Derpy for the throne now.
Wait, it still looks like Derpy has managed to at least be rid of Celestia.
