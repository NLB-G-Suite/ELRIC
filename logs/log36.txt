poor twilight
Civ I is extremely basic anyways
But you wanna play Dune 2?
can I request a video?
wait...that didn't come out right
i really gotta switch from Shaw
im saying, it was worth my money disregarding my discount
Speaking of, don't know if someone already said it but what is it for time warner cable, anyone know?
Balls of Steel version needed actual balls of steel.
So frickin' stoked that they're working on DVDs now
http://www.abandonia.com/fr/games/12166/Dune+II+-+The+Building+of+a+Dynasty.html
Sure
i have a bust of duke, im happy

lol whups linked to the french translation
0@dashite just steel spheres? what would be the point?
I'll buy it with pride when that dvd comes out
@BronyJack just hope they don't make them $72 :P
$60 I could use to preorder a copy of ME3 instead.
Carpe Nukem?
ME3?
jesus, i've been here since 2 arizona time, it's 9:30 now.
>Idon'tgiveafuck.jpg
oh no
wtf
CircutMane prolly not
Derpy's version
D:
There's Dune 2k also
http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/27329/Dune+2000.html
Mass Effect 3
Mass Effect 3
ah right
awesome game
it is
can't freaking wait
skyrim ftw
that's Applejack
:P
1st one was my favorite
I really want a Blu Ray version ... it might happen, seeing how they have HD versions
Dune 2k is abandonware now?
lol, MW3 PMVs
I reccomend Dune 2k
Yep
no, look in the related videos
WANT!!!
Mass Effect 3 for the win.
^_^
gow 3 FTW
2nd one was awesome but went down a bit for me
or was that a "Just kidding, I posted Applejack"?
It's abandonware
I hope mass effect 3 is better than da2
Mass Effect 3 is looking to be great.
0i really hope they don't screw up ME3 like they did DA2
look what song Derpy's version has
i love my PS3
Well, what about RPGs?
da2 sucked
Hmm. Might have to grab that.
Also, yes Mass Effect 3 is going to be ... EPIC!
imho
Good RPGs?
The guys on Abandonia make absolutely sure
you and me both, nah
oh, hahaha
im hesistant to buy another bioware game after DA2
That something's abandonware
they are adding MP to ME3 so says the rumor mill
good thing i didnt buy da2 though
before releasing it
DA?
sooo yeah
never played dragon age 2, why did it suck
I like AJ's version
fuck you EA
Frame_Rate_Pony They might need a bit more bonuses to fill a BD imo
dragon age 2
isn't ME3 going to be the last one?
I'm really looking forward to MA3
Dragon Age
THEN EXPLAIN X-COM!!!!
well
Trust me, they're strict about it
Is Baldur's Get abandonware yet? Because get that if so.
*facehoof
planned?
EA really needs to go away
derp
ah dragon age did not grew on me
Mass Effect, 360, PS3 or PC? What's your preference?
ME3**
i got bored
:P
Ivan, it says you can BUY it
haha
Dragon Age
(erm, Gate, not Get.
PC
Not download for free
PC
PC
I kind of like it too
Hold on
bioware would have made da2 better if EA didnt give them such a short development time i think
PC PC PC PC PEEE CEEEE
PC!
Fighting was bad, storyline was nowhere near as epic
pc
Ahh damnit.
0@misery let me fix that for you
I'm a PC gamer though and thopugh
I know
PC for skins, PS3 for gameplay
lol
allright guys, see ya next week.
That's false, Bioware confirmed in a magazine article there will be absolutely none of that multi-player shit in ME3.
0"Activision really needs to go away"
PC - and I only own a 360.
haha
the only song I enjoyed dancing to back in PE
yea
PC
ps DNF is shit on the 360
I'm a console peasant
:P
They played it a lot at this camp I went to in 7th grade
oh,and they used the same cave over and over
Im PC, but I think I'm going to switch to 360 for the kinnect support
activision needs to go away also
I got too many FPS games.
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/02/100-things-pinkie-pie-is-not-allowed-to.html
controlls are lame
gah
Found it.
Or indie games
just blocked off some passages
so a lot of it's nostalgia I guess
13I love this song
Wrong channel
same here
DNF is better on PS3
xD
Shin Chan
PC is okauy
So, I want some good Strategy and RPGs
brings me back to high school gym class
Sorry for the random link
We should watch Equestrian Gurls
kennect SKD is out and allows PC suport
Great.. now I need to go watch Shin Chan again
lol
so why 360
Pinkazoid
can we get some epic rap battles of history up in here
Unique strategy
Hmm, that gives me an idea of a poll, how many of us bronies are PC or PS3/360 gamers
Like X-Com or WiC
kinnet finally getting some good uses
there's a few new suggestions in the thread
PC only here
Outline, it's not on Abandonia
GOG.com is a good place.
ya good one
i play pc
yes
pc
depends on the game
0ShinChan <3
i am
360 here
I Googled it and some site has it
Requesting Muffinproof.
all of them
pc/360
PC here
But I don't trust it
FPS has to be a PC thing
Those aren't your typical RTS or TBS
im PC/360. mainly 360
Hrm. That's a shame
PC here
@ RainbowSmash how about all of the above?
seriously
I disagree
PC, 360, .....and WII
fps on consoles is flawed
Oh, there is TeS
anything else consel unless i like to mod it
i'm PC... with an unloved Wii
analog sticks are terrible for accuracy
PONY POLKA
pony polka please
The original Elder Scrolls and stuff but Bethesda actually released it
aye, FPSs on consoles are just awkward for me too
yay pony polka
I have Civ V for all my Turn-based needs, and Typical RTS games bore me.
Holy batshit, Weird Al likes this?
on their site for free
LOVE
yes
oh god i memorized this polka
yes
And a couple of sequels too
YES!
i love this one
yes
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPZjo7y2nnE&feature=related
Wii is the best for FPS. You can't get better controls for a shooter than the Wii.
excellent chioce
i grew up with Doom with uncles x3
AgnitioExMachina: If the site is GOG.com, trust it.
i like the second one a little better
I always had a problem with switching between guns and controlling my team without a keyboard
It's not GOG
So that's why I want some good unique strategy games.
They're quite legit.
Pinkie's version is to music from my ancestry's homeland
Weird Al is now officially 20% cooler.
so how long does the aftershow last?
a whole house playing doom on computer x3
i have every single polka on a playslist, and it takes over a half an hour to finish
Well then buy it there :P
oh, by Weird Ak
Al
www.freeoldies.com
Awesome!
Or something else
i love the "float on" part
I think it's a pirate site tbh
wish it was longer
yeah
Doom and Doom 2 are still great
I'd play an FPS for my Wii, but I never seem to find the time to go out and buy one...
I'm not linking the game
i love doom 1 and 2
0does the aftershow just go on the entire night
I just don't trust the site
wii doesnt even have that many first person shooters does it?
I remember when parents shat themselves over DOOM
dude don't do FPS on the wii
@SherlockHooves until they get bored or enough bronies leave
BFG
thats a bad idea
someone made doom for wii as a hack
Resident Evil 4 worked really well on wii
I need income uneployment sucks
I like the 2nd DOOM
0bluh
There were a couple of CoDs i think
oh well ok then
Hey are any of the other X-Com games good?
best part now
I'm out. Later bronies.
really hate RE4
Anyways Ivan hold on
RE4 might work
though tbh im brithish I coudl just go on he dole for a bit
Whenever I get a console I always end up forgetting about it and never playing the thing
FEEL GOOD
11Feel good, inc. Good song
Idk
nn leoshi
it was such a turn off the series
gotta love dat super shotgun
and there were the RE railshooters
0Resident Evil <3
AND WE'LL ON FLOAT ON ALRIGHT
Probably
very good song
What movies did you guys watch tonight?
Yeah, no, GOG's the only site I know of that distributes it legit right now
Wait hold on
StarShine <3
I hear good things about all of the X-COMs
aladdin and starship troopers
Ivan, there ARE articles on Abandonia of people rating games
so hold up
I should probably play 'em, since I got 'em for free
LOVE the music video to Feel Good Inc.
0RainBroDash <3
i prefer the pony pokie
sigh
lol
Ohh I would like that song.. Fell good inc

I only drink for the sake of seeing what something new tastes like.

But you wanna know the best part?
http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/96/UFO+2000.html
more of a caffeine-free mountain dew man myself
0Vodka!
I drink it once in a while, but never get drunk
Beer is good, guinness is good, there is a microbrewery in colorado that makes one of my favorite beers though, called "Hazed and Infuzed"
Great vid
It's X-Com multiplayer evidently
Root beer all the time for me
I only drink if its a special get together
I don't drink so my opinions are useless in the coversation
whisky is awesome
I'm a hardcore Pepsi Max addict
0Vodka is the drink of champions!
And it's abandonware

Mongoose, yep
Ruben you got the fluttershy shot glass?!
:O
be right back, need caffine

I think it's because its not a full game.
Yep
Cali brony here!
Hold on I'll link it for you

I'm gonna cook up a pint of ecpresso soon keep ne going all day in myy thermis flask cos I cooll like that
Well guys just popped in to see how my bronies have been. I usually don't miss brony movie night. Goodnight everyone.
Ponycraft 2 convinced me to look into it
Also Ivan, look here to find more strategy games
http://www.abandonia.com/en/game/Strategy
huh
^
Does the glass etching look nice?
Mongoose hold on
this for me
I've been so tempted by it
Same here
brb
it's remi's bedtime
I want the pony shot glasses
i started to watch MLP cuz my cousins watched it while i was babysittin them
for me it was this and that moonbase alpha parody
i actually saw Bridle gossip first and that was enough to get me interested
0If You Seek Amy.
Night Frame Rate
I found out about it on KYM
I woudl love a MLP sake set but so not going to happen
i got it from watching moonbase alpha lol
I seem to be the only brony who was convinced by CR from That Guy With the Glasses.
A furry friend that likes to RP different stories with me (mind out of gutter) convinced me to get into ponies to do another big RP, and it stuck to me :)
Dude, I love you so much now.
In very early March
unless I get out and make one
lol Rainbow
I remember the EXACT moment I joined the herd
i got so annoyed because i thought it was some BS main stream stuff going on, so i popped the first episode on and i got hooked
0Good ol RP bros
Dosbox + free games = win
Ive been thinking, what made you watch MLP, For me I saw it constantly over the net and I finally caved in and started to watch it and got hooked.
hell yeah
first episode i saw was the pilot first part with my cousins. I can say i enjoyed it more them
http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/195/Elder+Scrolls+-+Arena,+The.html
SoCal brony here
I started watching because of the trolls.
back
There's the first Elder Scrolls
MLP came to me really
0Epsiode 5, Day before my birthday
You need Dos-Box to play it though
and i was tired
/me looks back and sees the topic is still free/share/abandonware games, leaves again
and a little loony
0Decided to watch it on my Birthday
Look it up and download it
so i watched it
lol Dark
lol
0Became a brony.
before i saw ponycraft i was seeing alot of pony pictures on /v/ so i was curious
I saw a lot of the MLP trailers and the brony threads on the escapist and when humm looks intresting
rawre
good birthday i take it starshine?
my little niece actually introduced me to the show. I was babysitting her and she wanted to watch ponies.
ok
0Best of my life.
that and swithcing between Heavy Rain and MLP is kinda fun in a sick way
RIGHT ROUND
http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/27432/Elder+Scrolls+-+Daggerfall%2C+The.html
I ignored it on 4chan's pokemon board, then forgot MLP was a thing for a while after i quit 4ch. then I re-discovered it, but i dont remember what exactly sparked my decision to try watching the first ep.
And there's II
0And I have some CRAZY birthdays.
CR did a Pinkie Pie in five seconds video, that was enough to convince me, he's got excellent taste in animation.
I hear you can download them direct from Bethesda, though
i would like to try to do a my little pony FiM D&D campaign at some point
by 'ignored it', i mean ignored ponies
I watched the first two eps after I got home from work
I felt bad for making fun of MLP after I found out I loved it
thats awesome
My Little Seinfeld plox
alrighty then
i'd love to do a FiM DnD campaign sometime
0Yes pleas
im up for nother few hours
jumped into my truck and went to McDonalds at 2 am to buy toys
0My Little Seinfeld
But you need Dos-Box to play them, though
dam.
i gots the caffine
once again
one of my exs ribs me for being openly brony
lol BronyJack
that would be awesome, Broonsbane.
xD
i still think RD is tomboy. not lez
Exclamation Point
she don't know whatg she's missing
^^agreed
im glad i didnt brush it off as a cartoon for little girls
I'm packing now
i think she is Tomboy too
ok
Yep, my friend nuke showed me WWU, and I thought it was bad because of of Rarities first lines about boots. I cam to like it eventually
0Broonsbane, I would do anything to get in on that.
RD is more borderline for me
i need more ponies
So sorry if I'm slow to answer
lawl
I still got the drawing challenge to do, and probably should clean up around my area
ponies ponies ponies
possibly lesbo but is in denial
RD is bi as every one cool is BI ( at least in my experirences XD)
well i'm no DM though
i used to know someone like RD, she was totally lesbian
Hey, talk about ponies and I'll probably talk about them too
pony pony pony pony pony pony pony pony pony pony pony pony pony pony pony pony pony pony
0Yeah, neither am I
I've read too much fanfic to ever think rbd is anything but a lesbian >.<
I'm more convinced Twilight is a fillyfooler than Rainbow is
what challenge CircutMane?
hehe well, while we are up, how about a good horror movie
YES
PONY
Otherwise, still more abandonware
i'd be one of the ones that follows the rules
duMORI mm.. I can live with that!
awkward when your parents find you coming back at three with eight happy meal toys
MORE PONIES
yes!
and kills everyone
oh it's okay
didnt some finland brony change his name to RD?
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWw
11:D
awsoem
the girl toys
THERE IS PLACE
Also I don't want you guys getting sick of ponies
yes
EQGirls!
I understand
What is the definition of Abandonware, exactly?
AND BRONIES
yay
woot
bronies
so you'll be leaving pretty early tomorrow?
HEY THERE
They own my soul
DJ-pon 3 x3
No one can groove like the girls with the hooves!
yeah that one mad me laught
I don't think I can get sick of them
...
I think it's software that the rights to have been given up.
i really like how they are reacting to the fanbase
http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/184/Grand+Theft+Auto.html\
BRONIES
it makes me happy
Something along those lines.
yeah
6:30
Just gonna leave that there
^ me too! :D
yeah only show eavr that cares about the fans
Yep Dark
Rainbooms are epic
its rare to see a show that listens to the fans
cant wait for s1 dvd's
i dont know any other show that does that
Yeah tbh I think me being a brony would only be one thing I'm hiding from my 'rents
and DJ Pon-3
pony fabulous
let alone a girl's show
Basically they're not being sold anymore
I just need to move the fuck out
is it fuzzy or furry coats? I never got that
It wasn't until the 3rd episode is when I got hooked, I was immediately hooked when Pinkie Pie was describing about the gala during her imagination.
D:
and are public domain now
this song came on the radio the otherday at work and I had to fight the urge to sing this version
i know a few shows that did it
I got hooked first episode
Ponies!
Ponies are evil creatures.
used my laptop to show vid in airframe class
do you have something to do for the car ride?
Ponies are awesome.
I must agree.
Bronies are easily the best received and most widespread fandoms I've seen
So you like evil things?
Why did she say Bronies?
is dj pon-3 suposed to be vynl scratch?
0YEEEEEEEEEEES
Yes, like ghosts.
Make me happy
...and sasparilla
Conversation With Cleverbot.
0OH GOD YEEEEES/
Its probably the best rated show on the Hub or at least in the top 3
OMG AWESOME
yes
Cool story
0This Video, more than anythign
Dude, don't fight it, dance through your workplace singing it! :p
>had ponies in playlist
prince glueblood
I've hatched a master plan to get one of my bros to watch an episode with me: gonna offer him beer and fried chicken at mine, paid for by me, as long as we watch MLP
DJ-PON3 is the stagename i believe
>pokerface.jpg
...no
:(
:(
wheeee
Cleverbot. Not exactly the most reliable conversation partner.
dude
/me falls asleep
ah, thanks raindbowsmash
nope
suddenly, loud
Ever since /b/ screwed it over
yea
you could always draw
0Nothin; suits me like a suit
I told one of my close mates then I found it awesome when I frist turned brony and now she's hooked
It needs a huge reset
or play pokemon
What did /b/ do to it?
I think the guys in the receiving bay tossing heavy boxes would hit me if I started singing EQ girls
Zoot Suit?
They basically forced meme responses
0Dang, that episode when he got the suit encrested with Diamonds
I finally converted my sister, she agreed to watch the first season if I agreed to watch Supernatural.
I'm surprised there's no My Strongest Suit from Aida
It was the beginning of the cancer era
a few years back
you can also always text me
cleverbot knows about the weeping angels, I laughed.
my bros would just dwell on it way too much if i told them
HIMYM is awesome brb finding torrent
Ironically they also made it popular on the net
lol.
just if I'm not awake yet I won't answer until I am
Wow I just realized where this song is from.
The Weeping angels are dicks.
lALW
:P
Same here RainBro
where is it form?
where is it from?
except they would be sisters

my mates really have nothing to say about my MLP fandom
LMFAO at the end
lol
A show called "How I Met Your Mother"
oh
im not sure how to tell my serious friend that im a brony...
I thought so!
Hmm.
0How I met yo motha!
I told my best brofriend about it once, i think he's a brony but he won't admit it lol
this vid is pretty awesome never saw this one
I also don't have unlimited texting
they'd just make it out as being something it isn't, and probably shout at me for 'going back to the internet' (I'm a recovering WoW player and 4chan addict xD)
Dicks are PG
Yeah, I know
nonsense
exactly
XD
ponies are on TV
i converted 2 people into the fandom x3
500 per month and after that it's $0.20 per text sent and recieved
I was there the day /b/ officially turned catanically cancerous
and he did and the rest was history
Hah no-one can quit WoW
you will be back
Or rather the days
Mine torture me by sending me the most horribly written clopfic they can find. I think they enjoy my rage.
true
I got on 4chan when it was "new" and I was way too young for it XD
Still gotta say
but if you want to text me just a little bit
i haven't played WoW for a while...
I still call /b/ cancer
Rainbow Dash's armor
BADASS.
Nah, it's been more than a year now, I've got hardcore willpower
but then again i've been busy with other games
ftw
i need to draw my brony, and then get an identiy, then i gotta start converting
like i want to play it
I promise I won't text you too much so that you go over the limit
WoW is shit now anyway
RD armor is awesome
4.2 looks promising
got a bud who will watch if I watch his cartoon
I stopped playing wow like 3 years ago, best decision of my life
yea it is
Also one of the reasons I no longer use Chans
YTP?
but i'd rather ladder SC2 or play TF2
never liked wow IDKY
i got bored when it was vanilla WoW
lol
ok
So ya'll are finally talking about ponies now?
The crap I had worked for got taken away by a bunch of little sh**s
RainBroDash >Implying WoW wasn't ALWAYS shit.
Must admit, I've never really had much of an opinion of /b/. It's just a place on the internet to avoid, that occasionally attacks othe places. That's all.
i did not think it was worth my money after i hit 65
and i've been playing more or less since late vanilla
Giuld Wars gets me hooks for a month or two each year though
or 60**
lol
should I try making My little pony skins for tf2 or something?
I liked WotLK pre-Ulduar :/
don't hate
i just thougth of that
Vanilla WoW was great
LOL
LOL
All other WoW is shit
:3
I'll probably just start over one of my GBA games
by pre-Ulduar I mean pre-ToTC
im waiting for guide wars 2
ah
which means I'll have to find a GBA
lol
crap
yeah
I need good MLP sprays
Ulduar was fxcking SEXY
TotC was horrible
that hm?
cata heroics were kinda fun until warrior tanks were nerfed hardcore
back in black
guild**
*hm
./b/ is where a bunch of "good" memes came from in the past
Macho Man!
I have two
dam i dont like ACDC
Before a bunch of schoolchildren found it
cata suck
but I don't know where either are
i love acdc =D
D:
Ulduar was awesome
warr tanks ftw ;)
Google it RainBroDash
MACHO SPIKE!
Although I think Dio Brando was more /v/
i wetn to a concert
all about WOTLK
what you don't like ACDC
cata is better than wrath
DIO FTW!
Nacho Man!
...
wrath was boring
NO its no
Ehh. Everything seems to be better before the masses are introduced to it.
Blinded by the liiight
and...the guy next to me was smoking pot, a bit ackward....but oh well
run
But now it's just a moshpit of filth and idiocy with the occasional bright spark that gets dulled down by a bunch more idiocy and filth.
wrath was awsome
xP
Outline, yep, that'
is all like pew pew
/b/ is just an imageboard that got discovered by kids trying to look cool.
That's what I see it as.
I'm against any game that expects me to pay a monthly fee for the continued privilege to play a game I ALREADY paid for.
F*** yeah!
is the way of the hipster
like every game?
lol
dam
fuck...rick rolled
rick rollin DJ PON-3
@Outline: That's a very hipster view on things. xP
11RICKROLLED!
DJRoll?
lol
an your DS can't play GBA games
But oh so true
Gordon, basically, and they ruined it to Dark's description
...yes
*and
dear god spike
yes to this
i feel sad after that XD
Hey, Hipsters were cool before being one was popular...
11XD
So So true
lol
fuuuuuu
They hear it's "omg SO HARDCORE" and then it became hipster central.
hamma time
I've always been a fucking Hipster
lool
now to be fair you do get content expansions every once and awhile for "free" from WoW
Now it's a paradox
NOTHING AT ALL
stupid flander
s
Like those Goth kids
lol nothing at all
refreash
stupid sexy Rarity
11Stupid Sexy Rarity
Sonnava!
from South Park
this is great
just 2 more hours before I can go to sleep
I just dislike how casuals in that game believe that they are entitled to 'see all the content' when they're just not good enough. so nerfs happen all the time, everywhere
yeah
Mmmhmm.
I miss my old DS
You're a hipster if you aren't a hipster, because being a hipster is too mainstream.
Hey, can't be hipster 100% of the time
I wish it didn't die
:(
XD
we should watch some flying circus stuff :3
I'm really sorry about that
LAWL
it ruins the game for skilled players :L
i'm kinda casual but i like it hard
Mostly browse /tg/ nowadays.
Well look at the upcoming nerfs...
KHAAAAN!
I'd rather pay for the free expansions than a monthly fee.
and the nerfs made me said
KAAAAHHHN!
It's a paradox
KHAAAAAAN
Dark, I've said that before but that isn't very hipster to disregard definition
11XD
lol
said? i mean sad
XDD
LAWL
KAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHN!
...FLYING CIRCUS PARROT SKETCH HAS BEEN DONE WITH PONIES

This song is in Mushroom Kingdom Fusion.
OH MY DEAR GOD YES
lol
fuck the neighbours
I loved that game
Wut.
If I saw Flutterguy first, I would have really known I was a brony
i like this sonic the hedgehog song, regardless of the fact thats its a bit overused
sonic got bad after the dreamcast one
Dark, read the crap I typed
Ahh, the Dreamcast days, its a shame the console didn't survive.
Oh right, the Trolololo song.
LIVE AND LEARN / HANGING ON THE EDGE OF TOMORROW
I loved the sonic parts of the game
Just listening to this makes me want to play SA2
yep
forgetting whats it called on the dreamcast again
what
Agnitio is talking to himself
adventure
eeyup
what iiiis thiiis
Sonic Adventure 2
sonic adventure
/me tries to de-numb himself back into the convo
...hm...I have to go to work at 11 in the morning...nah I'm staying up to see the next topic atleast
oh and the sequel
damn those where good games
I'll just set an alarm
just two more hours
screw sleep
derp
We need more links, as if anypony hasn't heard it yet. xP
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6FUR_nhGX8
i hate the 3D ones in personal opinion
it killed it
ponies are more important than sleep
;o
welcome to the void
which one of you stole my guitar pick, I am livid
when i was a kid i awlways thought he said save ur beans and bacon
I have to at a con in 4 hours
I actually like the song, despite being gibberish
*burrows*
i like adventure, but other than that's it's the sega genesis for me
i was a dumb kid
It's the fans that annoy me more than the newer games.
so screw sleep
Like that one swedish one
Holy shit, that went on the Colbert Show?
11RubenFionne12: Sonic Adventure was 3D, and it was the best game of the series, IMO
like, Loituma something.
Ivean Polkka?
your wellbeing is less than ponies
Something.
Sonic Adventure 2 was ok :o
It's Ivean Polkka
xD
i thought sonic and knuckles was x3
Sure.
Which con?
Especially the ones who insist on calling him Soniku or whatever.
man we really like to argue about videogames don't we?
is it odd that i have dead space 2 paused to watch this?
4Silverscreen: Uhhhhhh
i only looked at the SA2 was okay
4No
hey
I loved the Chao garden rehash in Sonic Adventure 2, it was sexy. but I was a child
I like the two sonic adventure games, the rest of the 3D ones...not so much.
HaxBrony, no not at all
4Sonic 2 was the best in the series
well its less a con than a writers thingy but still
Hello thar.
its a small UK one
I'm sure we can all agree that it was Sonic Hero's and beyond where it all went to pot
Greetings 1597
yeah sonic 2 was the first one i beat
hello night ponymanguy
Dark, dude, you should listen to the non-censored one
of course
I <3 Sonic Colors and Sonic Adventure (1&2)
It's trololo because the Soviets didn't like his lyrics
i havent played colors
me neither
So he basically mocked the government
last year it got one of my 100 word stoies published
Yeah xD
Colors is epic
Color's is a glad exception
i need to try sonic colors, i been hearing good things about it from people who agree with me on old sonic games
And that's the trololo song today
wat
Sonic & Knuckles was the first Sonic game I beat
WAT
Heard it from my classmate's presentation
sonic 4 though disappointed me, it was a copy paste
bloody Sonic Heroes. honestly that game was so poor I cried
Is there a link to te uncenored one? assuming it's safe... Thoguh I guess it's Russian, so it doesn't matter much.
hey fun fact: did you know atari is responsible for chuck e. cheeses?
so... this just in
It's so funny though that I heard about it again months after I originally posted it
4Sonic Generations though, that game looks AMAZING
11RainBroDash: SA2 was horrible compared to its predecessor. The level structure was weak and linear rather than the freeroam of the first, the graphics actually looked WORSE, not to mention the story was all over the place. I didn't even manage to finish it because I couldn't handle playing it.
It's safe
first time in this chat, I didn't know you have one
sonic heros was compelty shit
but theres a pony synchtube marathon going on now
It's about a cowboy going home
I already got Generations pre-ordered
equestria daily rocks
just started
oh, anyone wanna see a twilight sparkle figure?
Good job duMORI.
hated heros
SA was the BEST 3d sonic EVER
it's been there for a while
11But that's my opinoion.
sure
marathon whut?
Sonic Generations looks awesome.
I forget the song name, though
No no fair point silver
Heh, it's true 5752 :)
so Can't help you there
11Pat: Hell yes.
thanks muffin_hooves
I'll respectfully disagree with that, Silbverswcreen
11Generations looks badass
11And I hear Color isn't too bad.
4I liked both Sonic Adventure and Sonic Adventure 2
about SA2. I like SA and SA2 equaky
4Sonic Colors was actually pretty damn fun
nice xD
oh god guitar awsomeness
jawfldukjhesf
Colours is a fantastic game.
me has a small spaz attack
but rairty white?
well i gotta go
lawl
i thought it looked neat
Silverscreen Colors is better than not too bad
laters
im getting sick of todays gaming community
/me meant to say /me
Anywho, long story short, I found the trololol video, posted it, forgot about it

After all, she's like the LEADER of the PROTAGONISTS
hercules really
well that shortened my lifespan.
lawl
what i have?
?~!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?! ebrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrb
11Yeah, they dropped the score for Madness Returns BECAUSE OF THE MAP BORDERS!
derp
aeiou
time to perform a rendition of Open Your Heart, at 6am with both sets of neighbours asleep #ComeAtMeBro
Alright I gtg now. Thanks for the awesome and hilarious time fellow bronies. See you guys around.
Well, not really.
a PONY?
I like over-emphasising
Moonbase Alpha is the best game ive played on Steam XD
she's just portrayed because she's so damn magical
It's the only show I've seen where you could put up a viable arguement for ANY of the characters as the "best" one.
why is this being played =(
gnite bob
MAP BORDERS OMFG
11How fucking stupid is that?
windknight...not cool
Yeah xD
duh
gmod
Dark, then can you imagine the show without her?
true
You know, I like all the six except for Applejack, I mean, is cool, talks funny but I think she DESERVES more character development
it's on steam
what did duke nukem get
4I wouldn't be surprised if they dropped the score because lack of Multiplayer too. Oh, don't forget that THERE'S PLATFORMING IN IT
did they own FO3 and NV for them
Without her discovering Nightmare Moon?
they even all have specific elements they contribute
4And it's a fucking platformer
need moar dash
I mean, her cutie mark story was the weakeast by far
And then basically befriending the mane cast?
quite literally
But the personalities are so different, they can't be compared viably.
nah it was actually Portal
Silverscreen I think we all know IGN is lame. It's a simple fact of liffe.
everything has to have multiplier >.>
OMG a remake of a 3rd person action platphormer has platforming
Without her, there'd be no MOTHERFUCKING CELESTIA
Opinion and preference weigh too heavily.
SHIT1
exactly, i think
NIGHTMARE MOON FOREVER
11No, they did complain about "a repetetive fighting system"
Meh, when was the last time IGN rated a game successfully?
fo'neva?
Somepony said my name! Why have I been summoned?
celestia could have handled it
You say that like it's a bad thing Agnito :P
never
Your fault.
4I remember hearing that, but otherwise there was actually no mention of gameplay otherwise
lol
exactly
exactly
IGN is just there spouting shite
nightmare moon is lame pony
She jsut wanted Twilight to do it 'cuz she's a lazy troll.
OH SHI-
I like Luna but Nightmare Moon is a cunt
LUNA...
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/25356
oh like Fox news?
a bit harsh
I hate IGN cause for one reason, they dont give a shit for sonic. Seriously a 4.4/10 for Sonic Adventure 1?!
11Honestly, I think IGN just hates on anything that doesn't have CALL OF DUTY on the cover.
Agn keep that in EquestriaAfterDark
But WHO ARE THEIR PARENTS
true
Luna is a train of severe emotional instability
lol
I WILL NEVER FORGIVE WHAT NIGHTMARE MOON DID TO YOU!
still a mystery why she haven't appered at all in season one, after the second episode
Nah, IGN hates anything that doesn't pay them
4In fact, was lack of multiplayer and repetitive combat really a reason for giving it a 6.6?
lol
6This is truth.
you know the worst thing about nightmare moon
Call of Duty Alice
I have an itching feeling that IGN is a covert branch of Fox News
Silverscreen, that's the truth.
4Call of Alice
User, she's locked in a towe
sorry but I dont get this MP love
http://imgur.com/QyBsB
not a question, by the way
Actually Season 2 will probably answer that
mp makes the game extended for a few years
Multi-player sucks.
6...and then video died. ;-;
brb
So i hate toys'r'us in canada.
They better have a valid excuse
lol Call of alice, madness warfare
no frigging pony plushies ;-;
11Ghosties: considering that Multiplayer wasn't promised and that the fighting system is as repetative as ANY OTHER GAME LIKE IT, I'd say no.
I want a twilight plush
Buy dem
it 80% of games its shity xp based grindfests with NO SKILL BAR GETTING A DROP ON SOEM ONE
oh
brb wata
LLLLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG
they might have that show on DVD
cod fighting system is still virtual whack-a-mole
Season 2... goddamnit why does oct/dec have to be so far away.
and screw up caps lock I didn't touch you
that would be awesome
Bollocks. You know what really extends a game for years? Being a good fucking game.
I demand instant gratification!
Outline theres a release date now?
^
Silverscreen Thats actually not true cause they want to not like a game thats why they're called Internet Gaming News and not Internet Gaming Reviews
lawl
hopes=dashed
Like SC?
4Makes no sense. One of the best things about Alice Madness Returns is that you get a free copy of the original Alice game if you buy it new
I'm still waiting, chomping at the bit in fact, for Guild Wars 2
like warcraft 3
Dee_Twenty well said
It's fall winter.
Nope. No release date. Just working off guesse.
lol buffering
s
which game is this from again?
they better make celestia white or i'm causing someone's ass to catch the pink disease
that's the longest played game I can remember
4And since I've never played the original Alice, needless to say, I'm pretty excited
sounds like sonic
On the toys?
Ghosties but I still have mine on disk :)
It is
what?
Personally I can understand if the game needs or can make good use of multiplayer but there are some games that will not work as well with it. I'd hate to see an RPG with a forced Multiplayer in it
hey
We should paint the Hasbro HQ pink.
the orginal is fun btw
who is the best person here?
they made celestia pink,
Sonic Heroes Final Boss theme
well oblivion could use multiplayer
CircuitMane like say ME3
at least just a 4 player coop
Is the Hasbro HQ white?
Love this song
11CircuitMane: Actually, I could easily see an RPG with multiplayer.
oblivion
not anymore
That's because the Hasbro toymakers are fuckin' dumb
it'll be pink
4 player coop or dm
NO, just no anon, no multiplayer in my oblivion
xD
CoD is the gaming franchise that could use co-op
I don't really know why it matters.
=/
11But a game like Madness Returns that relies on a story around a single character?
4duMORI, that's some awesome dedication to keeping up with a decade old game disk
6There are quite a few good multiplayer RPGs.
not TES dosen;t work with MP
does FF6 count? where both player 1 and 2 could select attacks
Pink is generally more appealing to girls in their opinion. >.>
@silverscreen I'm not saying don't do it, just if it's designed for multi then go ahead, but don't force it in if it doesn't fit
The toymakers are Chinese
@Silverscreen *cough*Tales of Vesperia*Cough*
belive me I've hacked it in
It's still Celestia pink or white.
Don't expect a quality product
FF6 counts as one
Decade old game disks? I still have my original copy of Command and COnquer.
except for Chinese dishes and such
as well as earthbound
same
I mean China
w.e.
11Anypony hear ever hear of Lost Vikings?
Yes
4Kinda like how everyone and their mothers were BEGGING for multiplayer in Skyrim
Oh yeah!
Indeed.
Eeyup
I was playing Red Alert 2 tonight ftw when i couldnt sleep
Yeppers
yep
4And then Todd Howard shut them all down
11Sweet
I have the mega drive verson some place
i love red alert 3
old fun puzzle game
Damn Chinese, stealing the jobs of India
4I don't, Silver
red alert 2****
11Any of you want a remake of said game as much as I do?
WE SHOULD BE OUTSOURCING MORE TO INDIA
>.>
...
I think I have an old Diablo disk somewhere
Yes!
TES with MP is just no
Affirmative
Ghosties: Sweet
yes and no
11I mean, that'd be a badass game.
its single player full stop
Okay, I don't think we should go into the topic of foreign laborers any further.
What?
I think there was a remake on the GBA.
just liek when the added MP to the fable games and lo it sucked
it just make it to try to match todays "modern" gaming
@Ghosties games like that and Fallout 3 would be hazardous for multi, it would probably break the game and ruin the atmosphere to a bit extent
and suger coat it
11Dee_Twenty: That wasn't a remake, it was just a re-release.
sugar**
Domestic laborers, then?
:D
BEST NIGHT EVA
Fallout 3 is already broken. Multi couldn't break it more.
Dark, which nationality are you?
Fable 3 was awesome, well I liked it at least
lets just keep this at ponies
4And I agree that multiplayer should never have even been considered for it. Likewise, I'm also glad that multiplayer won't be a problem for Batman Arkham City
Oh I just being funny
white made celestia look more holy and powerful, pink makes her look like a princess wannabe
it was ok but the frist is stil better imho
lol
11I heard they're puting ROBIN in Arkham City.
yeah, the first one was good
Billions and billions of stars, billions and billions of specks~ <3
She is a princess
4They're concentrating strictly on first player
fable 3 just isnt as charming or fun
4Silverscreen wut?
A pretty princess
ik that
4Robin?
And... well
who here likes batches and horse?
but I really liked the epic feel of Fable 3
@SherlockHooves considering Fable 2 you can just say hi to everyone and get enough money to do everything in 20 minutes kills a challenge
fable 1 still king
4I know Catwoman will be playable in there
Ehh, they newed to fix her body type first
11http://gotgame.com/2011/06/16/the-boy-wonder-will-be-in-arkham-city/
I felt so bad when so many of my people died at the end
yeah likely as DLC/bonus challenge maps
The only thing worse than a game that's got a tacked on multi-player mode is a game that ONLY offers multi-player.
Anyways if Celestia got married, would she still be a Princess?
Well this has been the Best Night Eva for me, but its getting late for me so good night everyone, see you all tomorrow! :)
i like bad religion, they make good music
lol
which is like the highest title
oh yeah
goodnight darf
You know what?
Night Darf.
Yeah I guess Fable 3 had that going for it
dont you know how royalness works?
She should be called the High Priestess
gnite
HOW COULD YOU
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Yeah, that sounds right
WTFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
...
pink makes her look like she's pushing the "princess" title too far, but white makes her look like REAL royalite
but I don't feel anything for my PC he's cut out mac bob
;w;
fallout veges was okay, they made the brother hood such asses
?
Celestia and Lune the High Priestesses
hhhhhhhhhhuuuuuuruuruurururururururrurururururuururuurruuruururuuuruururu
CHACCARON
Wha?
11What the hell is that song?
who here knows morse code?
Queen Celestia. it's not as catchy xP
Luna
4Well, at least he won't be actually involved in the sotry
4*story
The Brotherhood are supposed to be jerks.
Chacaron
lulz
Chaccaron
what is this song called anyway?
Maccaron Chaccaron
oh...
...___...
SOS
brother hood asses they always have been
theres only 2 legible words in this song
That's the only thing that keeps me from playing Team Fortress 2, there's no single player option.
I perfer Left for Dead
who here knows horse code?
So are they ever going to fix that color of Celestia?
well not i remembered back in the old fallout games
No
i don't really like single player fps
back in 1 and 2
Well I guess then a game should have a solid single player to start off and begin with, and then multiplayer if it works for the game and is designed very well
No, prob not
Dee_Twenty, you can play offline.
Because TF2... is a Multiplayer game
i casually play multiplayer fps
and there's a derpy video for that
I don't wanna go into why either as it'll piss the mods off
i laged and didnt notice
Oh well, not like I was ever going to buy it anyway
There's.... really no way to make it single... unless you wanna play bots
nightmare moooooooooooooooooooooooooon!
did i miss anything?
That's possible.
Herbert MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON!
YES
I'd prefer bots, yes.
cant wait to see a Giga Drill Break in mlp ='D
THOUSAND TIMES YES
6Sorry about that, was making sure everypony was paying attention still. XD
wait
Moooooriella.
It's possible
Is the best pony
why dont they have sunny d
Discuss if you will.
oh ya.....now you reminded me of that
YES
Tenaris, my drill will pierce the heavens
for the MOOOOOOON
And a story mode would be nice.
DEAD PARROT! THANKYOU

unleash the power of the moon
it's not a palladrome! boldon backwards is nodlob!
well brotherhood has good intentions
Just out of curiousity how did Lyra pop into the popularity so fast?
hooah
Well guys and girls that's it for me
SITTING
epic human sit
See you all next week
Brotherhood was only interested in technology.
Because Lyra's the bench pony
filamena. Y U NO HEALTHY
g'night
Fallout 3 turned them into lawful good paladins.
Screencap? I forgot that scene
Take care
for bettering the future
Lyra is to ponies what furries are to humans. :B
Someone find it for this sucka
what
Dragonshy is the episode
Oh, hello. Thought I might be too late.
Filamena learns from the best of course
gnite!
i love this sketch
Thanks for a lovely night
How's it going?
So did tactics
Good
not too late for me
And now i know and knowing is half the battle
not on a weekend
:P
Bettering their own future. They weren't sharing anything they had.
should be in the first few mins after the intro
Because Lyra is Bon Bon's eternal lover.
how about you?
Haha, good news, good news.
GIJOOOOOOOOEE
11It's not pining, it's passed on. This parrot is no more. It has ceased to be. It's expired and gone to meet its maker. This is a late parrot. It's a stiff. Bereft of life, it rests in peace. If you hadn't nailed it to the perch, it would be pushing up the daisies. It's rung down the curtain and joined the choir invisible. THIS. IS AN EX. PARROT!!!
Yus =D
Not much. Just watched Thor with a friend. Made fun of it throughout.
look matty
:P
argh
now we need to watch flying circus now x3
Bon Bon's lovely
this parrot would voom if i put 400 volts though it
:brohoof Silverscreen
my stream isnt resetting
to bad they broke them up mid season
Anyways I still remember the whole Lyra Colgate argument lol
sounds like my way of enjoying a movie
/me 11brohoofs back
What? Lyra and Bon-Bon aren't lovers, silly. They're just roommates and best friends. While everyone around them does think they're a couple they're completely oblivious to this.
yep
wait nvm
Ohhhhh
LEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOY JEEEEEEEEEEEEENKIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINS
6And then buffer.
This is still going wow.
depends on the movie really
So THIS is where NC got that joke
It's too corny to be taken seriously. xD
11dat buffer
Firends with benefits =/= lovers
But yeah, it depends on the movie.
yeah, I imagine
Lyra and Bon bon are as platonic in their relationship as Bert and Ernie.
ew
BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUfer
I just got this awesome image of Elipizo riding Rainbow Dash through the skies.
...pushing up the daisies
xD
I am back
WOO HOO OPEN YOUR HEART
11Sol: correct. He's said he's a fan of Flying Circuis.
Oh wait, it already exists
what is wrong witch y
I have yet to see it, but I don't imagine myself taking any life lessons from it when I do
y'all*
Wow, the secret's out
You know, the Italian Assassin's Creed dude
11FUCKING BUFFER!
MOAR BUFFERING!
hells yeah
Lyra and BonBon are just heterosexual life partners
ASSASSIN'S STEED
open ur heart is my favorite sonic song
I don't want to open my heart.
better than laG?
It sounds painful.
eeyup
:D
Oh God it Sonic '06 all over again with the loading screens
EVERYPONY is a fan of Monty Python, even the ones who say they aren't are just in denial.
4More Crush 40 I see
buffering gives me the wierdest boner
x.x
Buffering or lag?
Lyra and Bon Bon OTP.
http://i.imgur.com/m71R2.jpg
i love this song
XD
more sonic stuff
more like open your youtube channel
Haha, believe me, all you'll learn is that "magic and science are the same."
And there's no unresolved sexual tension
11Sonic Adventure Theme FTW!!!!!
Don't underestimate the power of love
xD
Haha, wow
FUCK YEAH
<3 <3 <3
WOOOOO
lol
Back and forth
Seriously? Buffering in 2011?
yep
oh
its not that good of an internet
Metal_Link YouTube sucks.
meh bandwidth issues
I've never played more than 10 minutes of any Sonic game. >_>
what's that song at the beginning of the game when Sonic is skyboarding after falling out of the helicopter?
who here has ever heard of the legend of zelda?
Who here hasn't?
That also needed more ponies.
me
11Dashite: WHAAAAAAAT?!
The guys on the Minecraft topic want a Phineas and Ferb crossover.
NEVER
It's a little too obscure for most of you
Ive played more than 20 sonic games
anyone know which one I'm talking about?
Legend of Lyra
well
sonic 1-3 and SA is all you need
sonic riders?
PonyCraft :3
SONIC ADVENTURE @
4You guys are gonna make me wanna play Sonic Adventure with all this damn Crush 40 >_<
ewwww sonic riders
2*
no...
@LogicalFailure: Really? I need to check there more often, that's really... weird.
visited my cousin who is an animator for season two
LEGEND OF LYRA?
lol, I gotta admit they did a good job on the vid so far
I just realized something...
Ossala, you just won the internet
"Who are we, wakin' with youuuu?"
*blows dust off my old dreamcast*
weird lyrics
YAY!!
I still have my old Sonic Racers CD
and got her to draw me epona, mlp style
Is Twilight link?
/me drafts up a fanfic right away
Didn't like Sonic Adventure. :<
11The poor dreamcast.
Is that the one with the space ships or the mines?
They play this song a lot on Celestia Radio.
lol ne
Never had access to a console back then. I was strictly PC.
Lyra of Time?
As Madmax depicts her?
*walkin'
it was the one on the gamecube with Knuckles
11That thing got a beating that it didn't deserve.
According to madmax, Twilight is link.
yep
4The Dreamcast was an awesome console
But any pony could fit the part.
and the first game with Shadow
That was my reference
:D
i love dreamcats
4Too bad it didn't live long T_T
Well, actually, it's Lyra of Ages.
cast...
I still have my Dreamcast
BonBon is link :DD
yeah
oh
Lyra of Seasons
other than the movie, what have you been up to lately?
mine can play playstation games x3
i gotta fun idea
BonBon's awakening
genesis though, was next to godliness
11Ghosties: that's because it kept having shitty games made for it.
But yeah.
what is the worst thing about each pony?
I WENT AFK AND YOU PLAYED THIS
Lyra would fit Link better than Bonbon.
even though i had a playstation x3
Q_Q
PonyAge: Oranges
BonBon to the Past
They kind of brought it on themselves with the Dreamcast and their ad campaign of "It's thinking."
oh well, jamming along now <3
BonBon's Awakening
Well right now the guys on the topic just are getting over a troll attack. I meant to say server.
11It had three good games: Sonic Adventure, Power stone, and Marvel Vs. Capcom.
Worst thing about applejack is that she sucks.
4But you have to admit that there were some seriously top notch games made for Dreamcast: Sonic Adventure, Shenmue, Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio
4Dude
Ah, I see.
lol
Soul Calibur
don't forget MvC2
what
Dash to the Past would work as a punny name
11oh, and those that you mentioned.
4Jet Set Radio was fucking awesome
Who's being trolled?
ginger, that it would
Hah Crazy Taxi
i'd like to know
Crazy Taxi is awesome
oh and powerstone 2
4But Power Stone was a pleasant surprise too
lol
Sonic Adventure, Shenmue, Jet Set Radio Squeeeeeeeeee
hello crashman
Nightmare moon is a pun without even trying
JSRF.
yes
jet radio was a fun one x3
3 good games. Oh and those other 3. Wait, can't forget those 2 as well. :p

There is a sonic ad at the top of the chat.

There's like 3 difffernt puns that can be made with my name
@Ghosties yep, they did
Mmmhmm...

In fact, Nightmare was made by adding night and mare when English was being into

Heh 2 more days until I get 200$

I LOVE THIS SONG, I too know the words

I've got adblock on my own PC, but not on this one.

Oh cool
4Cause you know, Chrono Cross is fucking amazing
Whoa.
my favorite games: FF6, chrono trigger, earthbound, and super mario RPG legend of the seven stars
Uhh...
Oh hell no.

Let's not go there.
I misread that.
Both, actually.

LLALALAAAAAAAAG
Lol

that is
Ah, cool
I loved the orignal Black and White
Super Mario RPG was great.
anyone ever seen Angry Tetris God?

Well, my dad and a couple friends.
guestpony, congrats
trigger >>>>>>> cross
4I never once said Cross > Trigger. I just said CC was amazing

yes lolol, that collegehumor one>
You made a South Park mistake here
4 days without sleep = mistaking vowels, and that's all I'm gunna say
?*
congrats for what
@rubenflonne12 okay, my opinion has gone higher on you
CircuitMane I do like a lot of CoD, Medal of Honor, Battlefield series, Left for Dead 1 and 2, GTA IV, and almost all the Halo games
You said to skip Trigger.
also I know for a fact I played against Bill Gates in MP
Oh, cool. I've never been to six flags
Aeiou
Tigger? Where?
cross is a nice game, just a crappy sequal
Yup yup, prenup.
As-in you referenced a episode
on B&W
i did?
Valley Fair though, there I've been twice
a good game on its own
and sucessfully got the mods to believe that you were racist
Wheel of Fortune mistake
Dark ,yep
windknight, ya need to play more old games.
4WindKnight114...you really should look to the past
cross is a good game on its own**
xd
yeah that's the one RainBroDash, I can't play tetris without thinking about it
Were you serious about drafting up a Phineas and Ferb crossover fic, DarkMemories?
"People who annoy you"
Lucky I remember that.
Really? There aren't any near you, huh?
What?
13ALRIGHTY MY FRIENDS
I neever said that...
@WindKnight114 Congrats, you convinced me of nothing! So far all I know is you have a FPS fetish with a cut in for GTA
O.o
13I had a great time tonight but I must take my leave
there are, I just haven't been to any
pff
13Love ya all <3
4Sure, I said to skip Trigger because Cross is an awesome game Dashite
I said that the stuff going on there were weird.
Like the classic Gensis games and the NES games too, yeah ive played those
Seeyah Brony
Baldur's Gate trilogy are my favourite games of all time.
Night good sir sleep well
Anyways who here thinks Victoria II is a good game and should I get it?
wait
Ah. Well, I wonder if I should know what Valley Fair is.
I said I was going to draft a fic about the Legend of Lyra.
adieu!
maybe not
can someone explaing what i did?
Also who knows how many gigs the expansions are?
Aeiou
But why would you tell him to skip the better game?
it's like six flags, but there's only one
11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The original vid was for a College project.
But no SNES in there

@DarkMemories, why haven't you slept in 4 days and why are you on here if that's the case? You got pony dedication, pretty seriously I might add.
why is Applejack a Commie?
Oh, gotcha. The CT equivalent is Lake Compounce.
Ah
Nogger
no, besides that
Yeah, quite.
aeiou
i don't see how the N word is racist....and i don't see how black guys can say it to echother, but if a white guy says it to a black guy, he gets pissed.. that seems more racist to me..
yeah, I haven't heard of that one
Because apples are red, and red represents communism.
no idea
Also Dee_Twenty is cool.
i was called a cracker
I had to finish a full semester of an online class in two days.
Is it just me or is Vinyl Scratch a way better name than DJ-Pon3?
*shakes head*
Valley Fair is Minnesota
i cried
There is a difference, cracker
why does blocks have everythign to do with communism?
Ooooooohhh
So I was awake 48 straight hours.
here in Wisconsin we have the Wisconsin Dells
4Hey, Sprinkles, I got something for you to stream
A new Voodoopony album
She's a manule labourer
4Just this once
Firetrucks are red because they're always rushin'.
a whole city of water parks and theme parks
6?
But now I can't fall asleep.
that place is fun
Tetris is a Russian game.
Haha, that sounds amazing.
Dark i suggest you get some sleep. it's not healthy
So I fill it with ponies.
11Anon: Tetris was a game from Russia.
blocks, as in tetris, as in that russian popular puzzle game :L
its the symbolization of even if you build, it will go no where
Dark, get sleeping pills
sabatoge that was a terrible pun
Too bad I'm leaving for a week.
OMG I CANST BELIIIIIIIEEEEVEEEEE that you SAID THAT
I'm going to sleep.
DJ-Pon3 is cool in writing, but sounds awkward in speech.
And don't die from sleep deprivation
lol
I have worse
Sort of like Ocean City in Maryland.
yeah, I've been there once a year as long as I can remember
hello crashstuntman
Got a 10 hour car ride up to a wifi-less cabin in Georgia today.
this is too fast for me >.<
11So the theme of it was turned to tell the history of the USSR
bloody tetris theme
Two goldfish in a tank, one says "you shoot, I drive"
and yeah i know it's the tetris theme song -_-
tht sux
And you're doing that while you're tired?
So, plenty of time for sleep, don't worry.
pretty much
Or are you a passenger?
4Sprinks, check your messages
it's a "pro" comunisum song to tetirs song
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N57VrjyD_r8
yep
wait
Ride, not drive.
at one of the waterparks they have this deal where if your report card has at least one A on it you can get in free
sounds fun, except for the 10 hour drive
you're a mod?
Thank god.
k lol
they call it A-Day
No distractions Dark mean you might get some sleep i think.
Half-mod.
Dark is a mod
LOL
Well half mod
and it applies for college students too :D
god damn those commies making a catchy song
Can you forge a report card?
GASP{
I want a mod for Oblivion to replace the skins of the horses with ponies.
knuckles chaotix! :O
% is half mod
A DEMIMOD
! is mod
Awesome Chaotix
I mean @
4Yep, enjoy guys
My mom always uses my sister's old one
Ew Knuckles Chaotix
:P
gotta rejoin
It doesn't really mean anything.
and...what was admin again?
11DuMORI: actually, it does a good job at explaining both the pros and cons of communisim.
dee_twenty, what is the skin's format?
I'm out, net is crappin out. Gnite Bronies!
And Seth is ~, right
?
NO CLUE how she gets away with it though XD
I just have the ability to kick people.
4You may not have liked the game, but you gotta admit the music was awesome as shit
goodnight
What's Fireant's symbol?
She looks young, sure, but 16?
admin is &
wait no after this song lol
yeah
dont kick me
all money, nothing to do with it and everything is shared
Yeah
im sore
it was grat
Which really is insignificant to my presence here as a brony
and free
&
11It does mention how Stalin abused the system for his own gain, and how it smothered the people of the union in the worst of times.
I haven't kicked anypony yet, don't want to have to
Make way for the Chaotix son
I assume it's not that thorough. Just like birthday benefits. at restaurants.
who here likes PONIES
That wired article where they interviewed Seth was interesting.
question mark
Yeah
yup
ur not my father.
I'm just here to keep the chat in line when I need to.
I like ponies.
Er, omit the random period that found its way into that sentence.
Ponies!?
oh
Not sure. I know I saw somepony post an image of a mod to ride Big Mac on Ponibooru, but no download link.
that makes sense
Ponies are wonderful
That Wired article was awkward as I have ever seen
PONIES
lol
they probably could care less who they let in as long as they get payed
SEINOP
Seriously, that fucking creeper at the top of the article?
who here has ridden one before?
@guestpony: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tZMYryMyBE
Silverscreen I heard
I haven't heard of anyone liking ponies around here.
Yup. :P
I mean seriously
wait guess I'm not out, net is cooperating again
well, yeah. there was that
0cant beat the Fal'cie in chapter 9
I've ridden horses before
wait what is the image format for the skin? i could try my hand at it if it's easy enough
I hate horses
Bye RainbowSmash!
for bolivion horses
They're fuggin stupid
Though the cons camethough to me in sacasum plus I was AFK for a bit of it
But I love ponies
the power of the ponies has brought my internet back to life!
Esp drawn ones
there needs to be a mod for fallout or oblivion that changes player and NPC models to ponies.
lol
Am I weird
???
NOT BYE THEN
giant overhaul, but it'd be worth it
hai rainbowsmash
Eh, horses could be better.
lol
kinda
Ponies rock though.
oh by
Indeed.
i wont be able to tell who's who now
I have ecpresso to make on mass
In order to keep it from getting crowded though, you have to be signed up for their email newsletter to know when it is
year!
>implying he could change horses to make them better xD
no offense, dues extra machina
?
finally a benefit to spam email
:P
oh
duh...
For some reason, I think it'd be kinda funny if a horse showed up in Ponyville.
guest, none taken
cool
I know how bizarre it seems
I really have no idea, probably tex but I'm not sure.
But I don't like real ponies that much either
yeah
4LOL Shining
kinda
why?
xD
wtf
Having just rode in from horseville.
lol
Probably because they're too much like horses
They're not cartoon ponies.
Isn't princess CElestia a horse given her size?
Wait wait wait i just noticed this and everpony must know
Ah, I see. Does it really get sent to Spam?
11o.o
what?
And they're not cartoon ponies
yep
HERE'S FLUTTERSHY!
She's a god.
11what the fuck...
xD
Well, sorta.
if it isnt too annoying ill make a mlp horse skin for oblivion
But, whatever.
depends on your email client
SUPREME OVERLORD CELETIA
meh bad edit x3 was expecting it through the door
but yeah
there's a vid?
I don't think it does for my mom though
celetia?
x3 heres jonny
who dat
Yes!
I'd ride Celestia all day...on some horse trails
She's an alicorn, and presumably much, much, muchhhh older than any other pony except maybe Luna.
YES
or else she'd never know about it
even her cousin (?) wasn't like her at all
MY FAVORIT POLKA
what is a celetia?
Love the Flutter! LOVE HER!
And maybe the sky <3
YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE ME!
There hasnt been any Ponifyed version Street fighter Guile yet =0
FULY MEMORIZED
this is NEW
PRINCESS CELETIA
oh
YAA
wait
I look through Spam every once in a while, since it tends to detain stuff that is actually important.
change that name please
6I'm a weird al freak. Deal.
Snips?
me too
can someone esplain someting please?
SOAD xD
lololololol
yeah, same here
it open a world of other songs for me
so now i liek most sogs
why does everyone mock that one pony?
Who need's to ride an Alicorn? Just have her use her telekinetic powers to fly you around.
I think the size of an Alicorn is the Alicorn's power level
the crosseyed one?
THE VINES
when helping my mom with computer problems though I noticed she gets a lot of it
LOVE THIS SONG
way too much to filter through
Luna will become as large as Celestia once she gets her power back
what is everyone mocking her for?
And Derpy? Go ahead
WAIT YOUR MOCKING THE MONOCOL EYE TOP HAT WEARING PONY CAESAR =0
Yeah, I can imagine.
What does Derpy have to do with anything?
Derpy is the best pony
Aww, then Luna wouldn't be even half as cute.
Derpy is always relevant
why dost most mock her?
an alicorn would be too proud to give people a ride on their backs, that is for a lesser being. She will use telekinesis to fly you around.
i know weird al irl, great guy
Linker, no, she'll be HAWT
cool
hi bronies
just for her odd eyes
Dittzy Derpy Doo iswin
i always hoped he was
hi
hai calvin :)
A lot of my SAT stuff was caught in spam, and since it's sent to my mom's email I missed crucial stuff I needed before taking it.
11ruben: cool story, bro
hey hey!
its funny, it was not intentional to meet him x3
quicksilver >implying I won't be a demigod myself by then
Al so needs to appear in season 2.
Oh wow
that must've been bad
the strokes <3
What do you mean mock her? Who mocks her? You been by drawing comics where she acts loopy?
*You mean by
Pinkie and Al doing an epic polka battle.
my sister just did her ACT last weekend
Ended up not being able to get in, since the ticket was in there. >_<
11AH! PRE 4-GEN!
lol
Watch it Agnitio, asking (or implying) for a mod position gets you nowhere.
xP
this is perfect
11IT BURNS!
hahaha OOO-AH-AH-AH-AH
I wasn't asking for a mod position, silly
op me plz
ah gods!
:D
oh my jesus
k thx
I AM SICK WITH DEMIGOD POWER
FEAR ME
Someone call the power of the ponies! My net is starting to crap out again!
Why?
*Shepard voice* Charge.
i think i ruptured my spleen at this polka, can't believe i've never heard it
Some people go mad with power.
/me 11wonders if somepony did THEY'RE COMING TO TAKE ME AWAY with Pinkie yet...
MY WAY OR THE HIGHWAY
I go mad WITHOUT power.
Mao Zedong for one
I won't need to the ACT for the colleges I'm looking at, but it wouldn't hurt to take it.
lol
It's really boring.
Goodnight bronies! See you next friday, and you guys, again, fucking rock!
I'm already mad.
6@Silver I hope so
cya Sol! <3
Night Sol!
I'm insane enough as it is
PEARZ ABUZ is bad. xP
rainbrodash, ingest more polka song or you will be sad that youve never herd all of them
Who needs power?
they are amazing
Power is for wimps.
gnite sol!
Nobody.
I NOT ASKING FOR TEH PEAR
what colleges are you looking at?
How ironic.
6I used to have to listen to that song every hour or so when I worked at a Halloween store. I loved it.
and there are some good 80's music polkas too
the songs in it though, ASFIJAIKOFAHFN
so good.
LIFE PEAR MEBE
hey before I forget, do the literal music video of leather pants!
Don't let me eat pearz. I. HATE. PEARZ.
NOT NOT CHAT PEAR

Who else is a godkiller besides me?
UConn, Southern... both local colleges.
Orph, I am a godkillerkiller
Ah
I prefer to commute.

oh, any bronies Incubus fans?
it's local for me too
6Oh, yeah.
11It's not that good.
11http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWfQ_PrjAQE
Celestia and Luna are exceptions.
I'm just a random guy who likes ponies and sometimes chats or forums about it.
11but it's there.
nice for when you have arrangements you don't have to change them over summer
Have a cookie for being honest

Holy moley

I guess I'll keep working on my luna fluff
bloody backstreet boys
6SPAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
Equestria Daily's really growing. I've had three PMVs posted, and each post gets way more comments than the last, and way more views come from ED than ever before...
i miss the 80-90 i don't know why, its not because i was a kid, its just...i don't know i just feel simpler times i guess and when people gave a shit of stuff
omfg I forgot I could make coffe this good on tap
Community's still growing. It's nice.
yeah tbh it's sort of insane
i agree ruben
but I I think i recall why I forgot
11Am I the only guy here who didn't mind the Backstreet Boys and N'Sync?
ruben the majority of us agree :)
Soon the world will be ours...
6duMORI... I dislike you right now.
I don't mind it silver :)
6I want coffee.
Just kidding
Like, I've gotten more comments on my pony remix than any of my other music ever
6Haven't had any in DAYS.
On the other hand the 80's and 90's didn't have the epic anti-fail of FiM.
Does anyone know if there are some PMVs of either Billy Mays or the SlapChop guy?
I am making fresh ecpresso
combined
nice
it is soooo good
this is true
esspresso is delicious
6Then again, I haven't even had food in over 24 hours.
i remember seeing one somewhere
just really nice beans too
so it balances itself
...
ok
11Dee_Tweenty: Then again, 80's and 90's didn't NEED an anti-fail show
Does anypony know how to make animations?
this song
:D
lol SirSprinkles
Is it just me or does this site/community move at such a breakneck speed that it is hard to keep up.
lol
Yes, JUST KIDDING, to any world leaders that may be watching. Ha ha! We're so silly, and just joking. Yup. Nothing more.
Hi
6I'm broke, I don't eat much.
the dope show
lmao
I swear I have a backlog of like fifty fics I'm working my way through
what is this video called?
All of a sudden Bronies are outlawed in all countries.
so yeah not much eatting here
oh ok
SirSprinkles! Get some nutrition in you, or the Flutterstare you shall see
Seriously though, we should have this planet locked down by the end of S2.
11Calvin...
xD
got it
lol
:D
It feels like just the other day I visited at the 10 million visitor mark.
11The name is right there on the vid.

6PMV - Pony Polka Power-video III
i gathered
I would vote for bronybama
11er, above it rather
ohoho
Got my vote
Again, anypony? Animators?
Whoa, Bronybama? ...
6I have no money, RainboSmash
Interesting picture
yeah I'm making a themios of ecrpesso cos I can
aw
That's canon
I spent all day pulling parts off my car only to come inside to watch Starship Troopers with a bunch of Bronies. My day was awesome.
I would vote for Duke Nukem
@RainbowSmash I don't think the promise of seeing Fluttershy is the best argument. :p
BroBama.
screw maikng coffee i can have coffee +
He's gotta be a brony
6Last thing I ate was a bunch of muffins yesterday.
MUFFINS
We need to get the Brony party to take over the Senate and House
i just earned 170$ doing IT for this guy who just got a new mac
obrony
so i have food
ummmm muffins
He's the manliest man on earth :D
w/e
YAY
:D
muffins
imma go get one...
DUKE
NUKEM
He be a Stallion.
i got £270 the other week in this one-day catering job at these dance awards
170? by setting up a Mac?
mufins and coffee really the way to my heart
The Equestrian Social Democratic Party?
or whisky
so all is good
Thank you.
On that note, good night.
heh
11Muuufiiiins
sabotage, you obviousy dont know many mac users XD
Europe will be named...
damn you I'm broke
well shit, i could do that
Since the background music is a differn't genre of music for every character, if Al ever does appear on the show his background music must be polka. An accordian at least.
I worry now that I'll only be able to view S2 in the context of "How cool would THIS shot look in a PMV!?"
One side note, DNF was a bit of a let down for me. That's all I got to say. Keeping it on Ponies
rofl silver
why, just why
well i had to set up all his VPN tunnels, RDP, and other shit
Then we take over the rest of the world with friendship, love, and if needed, toleration
Eruope will be known as Lunar Republic
Hmm....
*Europe
I'll get all distracted.
I shoudl really sign up to job seakers as I've been umempolyed for a year XD
11I love this vid
I didn't even bother with it, I just played STALKER instead
lol
Cupcakes.
duMOR
Hmmmmmmmmmm
I like the title "Lunar Republic" a lot.
u should go get a job
but then I did have 7.6K in dispoable savings
11It makes up for the fact that Eggman is such a fail name for the guy
ah
I just found my new background http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/25504
thats pretty nice
hehe he is so intelligent but so stupid at the same time
That short pause was worth saying it.
*saved*
Holy CRAP.
We need more nightmare moon fanmedia
THANK YOU NOPONY
god dammit ponibooru
lolwut
seriously I have let to read a decent NM fic
go faster
rainbow you crazeh :D
We need more Psychoshy.
/me 11will never acknowledge Robotnik as Eggman on my own.
What about a decent Luna fic?
:D
Ah Nopony, how has your family lineage been?
Dear god that is a nice pic
robotnik will always be robotnik to me
never eggman
?
I have yet to read a decent fanfic
doh ho ho
Hmm.. Africa then.. Zecorian.. something..
...
Ideas?
More of those would be nice.
oh god, pants :D
you mean robuttnik
Luna VS everything is hilarious
wasnt Robotnik explained as someone else in Adventure XD?
How much fic do you guys read? I havn't read any of it yet.
no sorry mib
oh god this one
11Eggman was his nickname Japan gave him since the first game.
6This reminds me... I need to have more GET battles in King's tournament...
oh yay! Love this and the memorys it brings
I am addicted to fics
I've had an idea for an epic story involving Nightmare Moon.
I haven't read any fan fiction. Don't really plan to. D:
I read everything that's not shipping
Whenever I want to read a fanfic I just read Doom: Repercussions of Evil
also yay for YGO abridged
13Uxie here!
Or already too long to read.
11what the fuck is this?
Some shipping is okay, imho
I am back with a FULL cup of expreso
4RANDOM GAME FACT: I used to call Robotnik "Robo Tink" when I was a little kid because I couldn't pronounce his name correctly
hi
6It's a parody of a parody
Agreed
13Hey!
Like some of it's really cleverly done
IMHO
haha ghosties
of a parody IIRC
like Spark
cute
and then capt_slowpoke was the demons
you so random
How's it goin?
just not the cliche ohhh our horns are touching stuff
it's the crowning pinnacle of literature
aw you must've been cute ghosties
11wow...
11this vid is...
13Good. Exept the ShoutWiki site is down, again!
11so stupid.
4Hey, it was relevant when we were showing The Real Eggman
no! You will be KILLED BY PARASPRITES
hehe surprised the world is not imploding in on itself
Shadows of Nightmare Moon slowly possess the Mane Six...
okay someone remake that story w. ponies
Oh please do the White Wedding: Literal Video Version
Oh come on
at least hilite Nightmare_Moon if you're going to talk about her
Actually that's what I'm doing right now
4I was totally cute, RainbowSmash :3
We need to mash five crossovers in one story.
yeah well the orginal leather pants had a found spoting my heart due to a night out with a massive crush of mine
also play take me on literal :3
maybe they would be corrupted like during their trials in the second episode
I HATE crossovers...
11This actually makes the original song sound like an award winner
What if there was a crossover of MLP and Doom?
No.
Aww that sucks :(
well this is a wierd video
and yet funny
mkay this video is
Doom has almost zero plot already, so it wouldn't be hard
Give them time >_>
kinda pissing me off...
though another night out with her wins for weirdist moment ever fucking slowdaceing to I Jizzed my Pants
lol
i dont even like lady gaga...
11can't...handle it.
11I muted the vid. x.x
The applebloom silent hill crossover was really funny and cute too
4Why is this playing?
Oh hey
4Who suggested it?
Dash becomes (obviously) Nightmare Dash, and Shadowshy...
and legitimately haunting
hey what about the "i threw it on the ground: thing?
not sure x3
hmm
what to do, what to do
cos YGOTAS is win?
Noone i think
Ah, let the shadowbolts rise.
Hmmm..
hello random bronies who I don't know at all
It has all the plot it needs
sup brahny
I've designed Nightmare Dash's armor.
4I think SirSprinkles should stream better stuff!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
11GHOST NAPPA!
very true, games should really have less plot
11This vid got 20% cooler
13That's where the wiki DSD and I came from is
13But that also means DSD and I will be more active at Spyropedia
It's pretty akin to her personality
oh, this sounds interesting to walk in to
Fluttershy, AppleJack and Rarity would be Prospit dreamers and.. Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie and Twilight Sparkle would be Derse dreamers. <3
Rainbow Doom sounds like a better name
6I'm playing whatever.
I don't know what to do with myself. I had a fusion of Monster and Red Bull about an hour ago.
wtf are we talking about?
Then my buddy crashed.
6Somepony asked for this video.
lol
Rainbow Death
oddly not me
XD nice
is this doom still, or what?
ghost nappa will never leave vageta alone :D
Ponies, I guess.
4You should totally stream JJBATAS
so now you're the only one up?
A Doom/MLP crossover
wadun't me
Play the Sea Ponies song, it's really catchy.
11how long is this damn vid?
play the eurobeat Brony vs. Alex S. Luna video
that sounds like an interesting crossover
Yup. xD He has to get up early, so I understand, but now what do I do?
lmao YGOTAS
okay how about ponies+The Longest Journey
oh x3 its a playlist x3
Nightmare Dash Armor? Image plz?
Twilight's planet would be filled with dragons as consorts, Spike being one of the consorts through time travel shenanigans.
Oh, wait... When did Nightmare Moon get here?
yeah, I'm feeling the same way
imho best video game ever
I don't want sleep
Nor am I tired
WIT
I will attempt to draw a cacodemon in the style of FiM
WAIT
Orpheon, I've been here all your life.
granted, I still want to lengthen my Geass/MLP crossover to hopefully get it up
k cool
but I don't know what to do
Ever since the 1000 years were up, Orpheon
What about MLP/Duke Nukem 8D
11A ROCK?!
Frightening.
PINKIE AND THE BRAIN
YES
4Gilbert Gottfried: DUMB ROCK
you mean 3D right?
THE OTHER'S INSANEW
lol
Actually... I've been here since you and your sister were Foals.
11:D
nope, 8 Dimensions
Duke would so look baller riding dashie
Ppth.
8D is a smiley face
:]
sooo much caffine soo bitter soo gooooooooood
how about literal version of take me on x3 thats pretty funny one x3
we gotta invent 4 of them
That's five dimensions too few.
but I'm sure it won't take long
Mainstream.
Fell from the sky...
Was this written for My Little Pony or Yu-Gi-Oh
I think we can all agree we need a pony FPS
Hm... I'm just looking at UConn's site now.
I used to be known as Andromeda...
Metal_Link ygotas
4I"m muting this one
4No thank you
6XD
I mean there are platformers, a couple MMOS and a rutting fighting game
6TROLOLOLOLOL
That's productive
Why does this fit Twilight and Pinkie perectly?
we need an FPonyS
4I hate you SirSprinkles
yeah I dislike this xD
4So much right now
11We should start watching some Yu-Gi-OH and DBZ Abridged
6Just messing with you.
Wheee!
I should follow your example and do something productive!
best pause ever
hmmm
4WE NEED TO SEE SOME GODDAMN HOKUTO NO KEN
I have almost a pint of ecpresso im in god damn heaven.
hah
I really want to play that fighting game.
"The University of Connecticut's Waterbury campus serves more than 1,000 students annually." I lovr how they try to make it sound like that's a lot.
How would it work?
4FIST OF THE NORTHSTAR
11Hokuto no ken?
*love
lol
nope.avi
Toei had Team Four Star's newer videos pulled from YouTube.
can we do older song? im not really likeing the mordern songs
Hahaha, yeah
x.x
Vanilla coke. that is all.
11buffer?
6Trolling so hard.
ugh
how do any fps games work? you shoot bad guys
no flutter ponies, those would be OP
keesshhaa
I'm thinking something class-based, like Team fortress 2
4Fist of the North Star, which is just about the manliest fucking anime you'll ever see
*turns off my headphones*
actually brb anyway, gotta get mroe caffine
mfw Ke$ha is a guilty pleasure of mine. HATERS GONNA HATE HARD
That's a little bit more thna my high school.
*than
11ah
meh.
So like, there are flying ponies, ponies w. magic, applejack has tons of HP, etc..
YES
its true, ponies make everything better
even kesha
is that the population of the entire campus, or just freshman?
In an MLP FPS, what are you supposed to shoot with?
11The Street Fighter version of this song is better :P
make it 720.
32 player multiplayer on cloudsdale
Hey guys
sounds better
4Also muting this
magic? apples? Take your pick
Well, it says annually, but that could mean either thing.
13Spyropedia's got less pages, and a bigger mess, but I don't mind.
=(
hey
true
miniguns
Are there any good PMVs? In b4 lol good PMVs
Incoming or total.
only 38 left :(
Apples could make okay grenades
AJ chose apples.
yeah, that's why I'm confused
instead of muting, hw about to get a cup of coffee or soemthing
They used apple pies
Aj should have a dash ability
There are some
this video <3
13That means I can hit big points!
I'm going to assume that's all, though. xD
11I'm gonna go, everypony.
11Goodnight.
as for incoming that's probably close to where I'm going to school
Pinkie Pie meets The BLU Heavy.
pinkie can double-bounce really high
bye
4Later Silverscreen
night silver!
and goodnight
<3
4A cup of coffee?
6I played a ton of PMVs, to be fair.
Nah earth ponies are just straight up inferior to other castes.
this song+ camaro soundsystem= gooooood times.
more even
Gnite!
NN sir may yopu sleep be restful
4It's almost 2 AM over where I'm at
The Trouble is a Friend PMV is pretty awesome.
6See ya Silver
Pinkie Pyro :D
11I H EARD NANCAT!
lol nyan
11NYANCAT*
Is it a private college?
They have greater earth-based abilities
11WHERE WAS IT?!
its 7am here man up
6was an add
yep
yeah its 1:30 here
4Silver rushes back for Nyancat
Same lol
6*ad
Even according to Faust herself.
not really that bad honestly
Like not flying and not magic
Then that's not so bad.
If I have my facts straight, that is.
I thought I was going crazy too
11lol, ads using Nyancat
They do the menial tasks.
Maybe earth ponies can work in a supporting context
But general harvesting, land-working, menial work type things.
4Have a good night, Silver
Have fun with that
but then I realized I was around bronies, so it's cool
or medic
Nyan Pinkie is best Nyan.
if you open the original nyancat video on youtube, the progress meter is a nyan cat
11okay, I leave now.
just saiyan
you shoot with pillows, duh
And they're not considered any more inferior for being able to do so.
this one is public I'm guessing?
really?
ha
yeah i just watch the original nyan cat video today
is awesome
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YMFSeZV1v4 sonic rainboom goes with everything, sorry just sharing for lols *shrugs*
it really cool
Not by other ponies but we know
we know...
btw earth ponies can stand firm
What caused you to disbelieve the fact that ponies did enjoy your Night, Nightmare...?
just something funny and random sonic rainboom music goes with everything
That's CANON
to be honest, I think earth ponies are naturally stronger than pegasi or unicorns
*shrugs* sorry to be random
omg
alright, time to open a bit of Nyan Cat
brb
I've heard that their power is more like a passive buff, like increasing crop yield, superior stamina/strength...
they would have to be, nothing else to rely on
you better be :P
you will NEVER believe this
;)
Like, if RD tried to buck as hard as jack, she'd break all her pony bones
Personally I like Luna (Dream Mode) better than this.
*prepares to not believe*
go on guest
i just caught my little sister WATCHING my little pony friendship is magic!
No way. If she can pull 1600 Gs with no problem
has there been any PMV's with pendulum?
*sits on edge of couch*
awesome fact was awesome
GASP
Woohoo!
OMFG
so you guise. just tuned my guitar down half a step and dropped to C# so I can jam along to Winter Wrap Up. Commitment? Yes.
yay.
what episode?
little girls watch this!
16
6lol buffer
Quite.
uh
dude
A NOT 20 SOMETHING MALE WATCHING MLP:FiM?
24
what is this blasphemy?!
yeah i know
i hate tuning down...
lol
BLASPHEMY
Wut?
Yeah
Hmmm..
a little girl
That's not a kid's show
with her friend!
Death to the buffer!
im to lazy to tune down to C#
Yeah... too public.
I have an idea for an alternate take on Derpy's personality
you should cover their eyes
make her watch it's always sunny in philly
Haha
Isn't nyan really old like 2008
my bass has been in Drop D for ages. never bothered retuning it
She's actually a shell shocked veteran.
it's not for them to watch
Since when have little girls watched FiM? Inconceivable, I tell you!
Man who'd have thought that a show for 18-30 year old males would be popular with little girls?
0love this song
Might have to enroll under an alias.
but you dont really need to drop it to C#
i didnt wanna embarrass her
well that's weird
Send in the ShadowBolts! I DEMAND an explanation to this travesty of little girls watching MLP!
but aparently
just tune down a halfstep
the nice thing about public is it isn't as spendy
okay what's this other idea for derpy's personality
i got her interested in it
Haha, you should definitely do that
I'm tired of her being characterized as a full on retard
and she got HER friends interested in it
6I'm learning Winter Wrap Up on my keyboard, and my bass.
Ciroton's Derpy.
Yeah, that's the thing. Also, I'll be living off-campus, so that's another 5k knocked off.
Nopony: I just told you, shell shocked veteran
well I tune down halfstep, but then to get the lowest bass note in the riffy part in the first verse, it's that low c~
new student, name Herman Melville
c#*
ohhh
Hahaha, yes!
1000 yard stare
is there tabs or something for Winter Wrap up on bass?
my god, before long little girls everywhere will be watching my little pony
so I have to drop my E down to C#
who could have ever imagined that?
6Not that I can find.
what have we done?
Meh, I wish I hadn't stopped learning the alto sax
I was trying to reference Catch 22
I've seen her depicted in some fics as merely having a vocal disorder.
i always wanted to learn base, its only a 3 string guitar but some reason i feel its much harder >.>
stupid young me
We must act quickle 'o my brothers...
bass*
Get GuitarPro guise!
I think the whole universe can be her dying BZ hallucation, like Jacob's Ladder
nope this time last year
not thinking about brony me
quickly*
but I forgot the name of the author they always sign documents as
4 strings.
Though in my headcanon she's pretty intelligent but with terrible hoof-eye coordination.
There's guitarpro tabs for everything
belly zecora?
ah still I though I was past thi when it got huge
i ahve guitar pro.. i think
oh thats not that bad
But hey, I also like the idea of her being a shell shocked veteran. :B
there's a torrent for it somewhere
You'd have to ask Luna that, by the time I stepped into the scene the little foal had already let herself go and I took the reigns. She wanted people to not sleep through her night? Simple Solution, let the night last forever.
What now?
6Bass allows you to be much more creative than guitar, I feel.
Aw, can't remember either.
BELLY FLOP
*splash*
=(
as long as you don't succumb to just playing the root note erry time :P
XD
BURN ALL YOUR FORKS
That would be awesome
;p;
6Well duh.
NO NOT NIGHTMARE SPOON DEAR GLOB
the spoon will last forever?
KNIVES ARE SLAVES
I love my guitar though, even though I've never had lessons, i love playing it
i must gather the pony folk
I should read that book again
and the pony yolk
Where are you truly from, Nightmare? I apologize for asking you these questions, for I am merely curious...
it's like a safe haven from bad stuff :D
i still like the rage against the machine style guitar playing
that was an entertaining read
I need to play more often
and even the pony solk
wait
6I had a guitar, had to sell it for food money.
4Gotta admit, there's some pretty disturbing shit in Hokuto no Ken though
=(
is there a daymare?
a
The soup... will last... FOREVER
6I'm close to doing the same with my bass and keyboard...
daymare sun?
awww
OOOOOOOOOOOOH IDEA!
:(
i have lots and lots of callouses because of my guitar
that makesme sad =(
lol
yeah
We have a RD Nyancat
callouses
well, it had some pretty dark stuff too, but the humor was classic
Celestia's evil twin?
If you don't mind me asking, how old are you Sprinkles?
4Wait, Sprinkles, you play instruments?
now we need a Fluttershy Yay!
6I kind of do.
with a mustache
6I'm 20.
evil superpowered side
lol
i guess
Celestia is the nightmare moon version of her filly self
Pff.
i need to learn guitar
agh my tablet is acting up\
4Would you be interested in joining a band?
yay
you rock
woohoo
shut up SPOON
I WOULD
be interested
:)
you have no power here!
Oh gods.
(left my last band a month ago)
Celestia's Evil Twin? Covenant Mothership with Plasma Cannon.
=D and thus, the coolest brony band ever was born
I WOULD, oh wait, england for the loss.
Yeah, overall it was really good. I'm glad my uncle pestered me to read it.
EVERYONE MUST EAT MY ICE CREAM
everyone, guard their silverware!
yes
You will address her as Nightmare Spoon!
0oh god 1 hour
6I'm not that good yet, Ghosties.
lol
I was at one time nothing more than the manifestation of Luna's hate, fear, and jealousy, but appearently, getting blasted by the elements of harmony seperated me from luna's body as evidenced by my armor still remaining a broken heap on teh floor in the castle ruins
6 1 hour and LOOPING
Washington Irving!
i lost interested in bands when i was 20 x3 i did it all in highschool
That was it!
That was the alias they all used
dont have to be good now, can become good
6Because I have nothing to play.
Sleepy Hollow guy.
can become great
Are we really going to go the full hour? XD
Yeah
4It's just an idea, Sprinkles :) Besides, we haven't gotten off the ground yet
on teh floor!?
nice analysis, moon
yes
we are
6XD
I actually started signing stuff as that
going to go
the full hour
:D
Teh floor.
for a little while
wait, really? I need to rewatch that
shit I am WIRED now
you has teh good talks nightlymare!
same
6We're going as long as I feel like it.
Hmmm... You wouldn't mind me putting that armor back together, would you?
ah caffine
I sign everything at school as "Patches O'Hoolihan."
Seriously someone needs to ship NM w. pinkie
canst you speaketh more
pint of ecpresso is trippy
XD
6Which means probably a while, since it's looping.
What's that from?
nyan song = me leaving
ship?
it sounds so familiar
4Is there anyone in the current room that enjoys post-rock music?
=(
like on a boat
Dodgeball. :P
and I'm back on the stream
but i love the nyan song
6And I'm pulling an all nighter for the stream tomorrow.
yes
post rock
Oh yeah, hahaha.
yeah on a boat
on a shipper boat
is cool
w. spoons
0it shall be stuck in my head for the next 2 weeks
I don't even know what that means.
on a stripper shipper boat
Honestly, mistyping The as teh is one of the worst habits to break.
Don't forget those
indie is also
I enjoy all(most music) if its good
cool
well i like post rock, although it's not my favorite stuff
no NO SPOON POWERS
muting the stream for a bit, playing winter wrap up for guitaring
<3
One time I jotted down: "If you can read a form, you can dodge a ball."
(yeah all music is pretty good)
lets play some ozzy music
except for rap
<3
and pop
especially if you are a lame supervillian
ALL ABBBOOAARDD
The trick is finding an alias you are proficient at writing in cursive
i mean really
I'm sorry, *dodge a form
RainBroDash FTW
You can't spell crap without rap.
XD
some rap is ok
Hey there Outline
Not sure I'm proficient at anything in cursive.
oh my sister! Spoonlestia!!
music is like candy
me neither
6buffer says no to this vid.
(Any rap from Gurren Lagann doesn't count.)
I'm sooo sorry!!
4So then calvindapanda, and mib_xosqn3 like post-rock. Noted
Haven't practiced it since third grade.
Hey there
thank goodness our only hope@!
you throw out the rappers
=D
Evidently it's on the SAt, though.
Nerdcore <-- best rap
lol
hello spoony@
Did you call Nightmare Moon a lame supervillan?
a mi me gustan las gruperas :)
yes i did
My signature consists of three letters, then scribbles
and id do it again
...uh
though tbh I say tis as a writer with a social group full of performace poets
4I'd ask RainBroDash, but then he's all in England >_<
ok?
My analysis is this, if I was merely a manifestation made physical, then after getting blasted, all traces of me should've disappeared, leaving little Luna on the floor.
........Where's Seth?
wtf
she is a lame super vilain
Cha/\/\/\/\/\/\/
why is this stopped
who is seth?
LUNA!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Nightmare spoon is way better
because someone spoke in spanish
are we just playing this for an hour now?
music is like awesome
Hahahaha!
YAY
LUNA
lol
:D
FOALS
wait
lol
I read it as "Chav."
moonpie
:D
XD
YES
:/
only poni i love more than Fulttershy
are you REALLY princess spoona?!?
or we would if it didn't just lag
I'm all in England, yes. It's 7am. I would ask 'should i pull an all-nighter', but, too late? :D
Oh Luna... You are really the lonely astronaut
would she really adress us as such!?
i think not!
I am a chevalier
4Dude, go to bed RainBroDash
reveal yourself!
6We probably would have, Circuit.
Yeah RainBroDash I'm doign the same
soon
Sleep is for the weak, ponies for the strong!
That's no spoon, that's a space station
NO GHOSTIES, I'VE GONE TOO FAR
preferably now
bed? He needs to get out of bed!
I have to start signing things in graffiti as "Alex DeLarge."
XD
lol you teh a dork able
I'll have to see this through
Nightmare Moon, most people consider Luna/NM's "time" on the moon was spent in physical form, giving her/you the ability to walk around normally upon the surface, merely unable to jump back to Earth. Is this correct?
its 3 hours past dawn damn it
then go to bed early tonight
4DON'T DO IT, RAINBRO!
that was Catch 22 also, wasn't it?
nop
nope*
I can't belive spoonlestia made me go to spoonyville to make FRIENDS D:
Nope, A Clockwork Orange.
Oh right
um idk luna isnt as good as fluttershy
lol this is so funny
I do believe someone would like to have a word with you... though I wouldn't want to impede on your conversation... I shall take my leave and regroup with Twilight Sparkle.
i think i see spoony pie walking uyp
fluttershy
Almost the same time of publishing, though.
I'm immune to two things, tiredness and hunger. I did this thing, and now I'm all superhuman and shit, long story
up*
That was the main character's name
(this video...)
(awesome)
13I will!
If you go without sleep long enough you'll start to see ponies.
Greetings HeatWave
eyup
H-h-Sponllo?
wait androdgemous
and rainbooms
Technically we were both trapped on the moon. Luna was there in body, I was in control.
I'm going to admit that I've only seen the movie.
I was told I look like the film version of him back when I had long hair
you were?
me too
4Activating Keanu "whoa"
I'm going to bed after my stake tonigh. Today would have been so much cooler if my mat didn't have to cancle on me though
Never got my hands on a copy of the novel.
wait, you on teh internets?
Don't forget Pink bolts
Hullo.
it is the weirdest movie I own
Oh, really? That's kinda cool.
well wasn't NMM trapped IN the moon?
so yeah
If you go without sleep long enough evrythign is fun
wait
i always wanted to stay up for a bunch of days... but i always get sleepy and fall asleep
no one gonna make a brony band?
so weak
Okay one second
I wanna learn Nadsat. xD
so was celestia IN the sun?
out of character
i was never fond of reading fan fictions,
I wish I could smirk like he does :P
70-100 hour is my haultiontion point
I know that. I simply was asking if you while you were there you were represented by any physical form.
Me too!
cronicn imsonia is fun
The ponytale says "THE STARS WILL AID HER ESCAPE"
How did you know I was compiled of two different genders, guestpony?!
why did those stars aid in her escape?
best I've gone without sleep is about 2.5 days
wtf does that mean nightmare moon
me and my friends did as much as we could all the time when we first saw it
I've hit 144 hors beofre
(fan fic is ok)
guestpony, aaaand
A warning for you.
(bubbles is amazing ff)
http://soomka.com/nadsat.html
how did they aid her escape?
with hallucinations at the 2 day mark
just btw
lol
a brony band sounds fun.
Just found this handly little link.
yeah
you start tripping balls at 2 days
magic, androidman
I've gone four days without collapsing.
yeah, that was the website we used
that sounds average to me because of my insomnia
really fireant?
sorry
what i do?
Like, how the heck does a star aid anything ever
Because Stars are just friendly like that. Always willing to lend a helping hoof to the local sealed-evil-in-a-can
lol
I've blacked out and fought with people due to fatigue.
we mainly said "appypollylogy" and "right, right, right"
possibly scattered pieces of her soul?
And second warning. One more and bye bye.
shit
What Outline said, really.
thats no good
Though I am androgynous, I control the stars... I aided Nightmare Moon's escape...
what?
lolol
luna
I've tried for 3 before, but I'm a natural insomniac
:D
oh, and we always called my math teacher the word for "old man"
2 days and you really do start seeing stuff
That and NMM probably promised them a portion of Equestria in return for their help.
its 3 for me as I regualy go for 48 sprints fucking 48 awake 6 asleep
is it like shrooms trippin balls or something else
/me ctrl+f's
if not less
6I'll probably pull 3 this weekend.
I must go, for I have said too much...
eh
not like shrooms
my metabaism is ownage
uh
just like..
fireant
wierd
that is only part of it
idk
no its more odd then shrooms
you for seriousness?
the full word is dedootchka
sleep dep is just fun
kinda like magic mint
Oh yes. Yes indeed.
(salvia)
I remember it now
That Luna and Moon Pie image is my favourite GIF.
whycome you be?
yes
for what?
:D
guestpony, quick, call mayor mare a hot pony
ah ic
I tend to just see pattern in everything like dragons in pages of words ect
Fireant will love tyou
oh yeah
-t
Those stars would've been the newest compass points in the sky had I suceeded.
and eggiwegg
that was always fun to say
That's kind of cool
thats at 50-70 after 70 I start really tripping
mayor mare a what?
when I go 2 nights skipped I start talking really strangely. I get really enthusiastic and confidently and matter-of-factly logical. It's like drunken confidence in my opinions being fact, but through tiredness. it's so strange
You guys are still at it?
hearing things, seeing things ect
suck my di-
and ew
lol
two rabis walk into a bar, suck my dick
They all are.
lol
id sooner call that pony ugly as truck than hot
lol
Of all the.... What evil Shadow Being f*cks up their own name I swear...
cuz that sounds odd
clop to twilight?
hmm
Guest, really. Don't.
A lot of it is directly cognate to Russian, too.
lol
Luna can clop to this.
spoonman!
Wait, why are you even here, Nightmare Moon?
You gonna take that, Fireant? >:o
Yeah, I thought that was cool
quit forkin around!
4You know what? I'm gonna listen to "Horse With No Name" and nopony can stop me!
Did I get my spoony mark? Did I, did I??
Because she knows she's gonna have your heads sooner or later, foals...
it aint like id call my dog hot
/me sighs and rolls his eyes
Eastern European languages sound so cool
wait
it
hotdog
lol
lol
so yeah
again
Squeee I just found my KOTOR discs
lol
brony band seems awesome
I admit, I chuckled
yup
They really do. My uncle's wife is from Belaruse, so I picked up some of it.
>*the sound of nopony trying to stop you*
;D
Ah want it now!!!
I mena the feel on my head from oin top of the dresser but YAY
KotOR is 20% cooler than the prequels.
yeah, I know bits and pieces of Polish from my family
YOU CANNOT HAVE YOUR SOUP!
lol
Last week... or was it two weeks ago... Either one... Seth and Cereal got to arguing about who the best pony was, it started this whole argument in the comments. I fed off the hate and spite and was able to remanifest myself from the remains of my armor.
KotOR is awesoem and KotOR 2 is ok-good
I merely decided to stay.
hehe
dependign on if you fan patch it
though I've been learning lately that they sugarcoated the translations when I was younger
:P
lol
I love how Charlie = Chaplain just because of Charlie Chaplin the actor. xD
B-but my sister spoonplejack said that if I was super good I'd get my spoony mark and all the ncie soup!
Oh. Well that's neat. I do hope you enjoy it here.
So it's been like what... 12 hours since the start of this? Was anyone here since the beginning?
it was a good game but the badly cut content was like FO2
/me 4prefers KOTOR 2 to the first KOTOR
Well, that's it for me. Goodnight everypony.
Haha, figures.
I was Apokalipse
when I thought I was saying "butt" when I was actually saying "ass" for example
guess thas what happens with THOSE people
haters gonna hate
lol
spoonight!
i loved that mod war
take out the first "when" in that sentence
but won't being around so much love and tolerance cause you to wither?
oh, and should I mention this isn't even my timezone. the films started at midnight my time
Haha, yeah
KotOR 2 without the TSL Restoration mod doesn't exist.
Ah... I was kinda hoping for a, y'know, war between shadows and light...
/me takes it out.
lol
luna
:D
You're crazy. I went to sleep at 3 am
How about a war between spoons and chopsticks?
Ghosties I agrees 2 is more fun to replay as Kotor's polt twrist fucks with replays
But if you want to just stay here passively... I guess that's also good...
after Alladin
you can't eat ice cream with chop sticks!
YES YOU CAN!
4Dee_Twenty: I played my KOTOR 2 without the mod...on the Xbox multiple times
i went for a bit after that yeah too
sure you can
Not easily, anyway.
ended up almost 1-shotting the Red Alert 2 allies campaign
It's unnatural. Did I get my spoony mark?
pffft, who wants to do something easily? You don't get achievements by doing things the easy way.
Aw, horseapples
I was able to turn my sister's pet unicorn against her friends that night. I sat by and watched the fireworks.
Lies! The game was never released until it could be patched and played properly!
then I realised that I should get off Red Alert 2. ended up here
fuck you PC
So where are you from, since we seem to be in the same timezone?
well my tablet is not behaving at all. I'm not gonna draw anything, looks like.
south england, berks
:(
what tablet are you running?
4*points at Dee_Twenty* AHA! That's what you think! But I have, in fact, played it!
I really want to get one
South Yorkshire
here
xD this makes me want to see the real ones of this x3
Oh neat. Need to go now though. Get some sleep xD
Yorks? Nice. My father lives in north yorkshire
No U apokalipse
4...just how many British bronies do we have in this chat?
Ooh look, Nightmare. You're on the cover of the new drawfriend.
Hahahahaa... that was an amazing sight. Sadly, the Dark Mane Six were defeated all too easily by that... poser, Orpheon...
3?
3 i think
i think
no idea
OHOHOHOHO
I think I'm British, does that count? :p
WAT
think?
except im chineses
and mexican
:D
Dee, where ya from buddy?
im chixmex
4Well, anybody can think they're British, Dee_Twenty
Ha, it's the image I linked about a halfhour ago, this should be good.
4I think I'm British
lol@chixmex :D
Hell. AKA Florida.
His damned... Friendship is Power...
jajajaja chizmex XD
RainBroDash where south sir?
Berkshire dude, near Reading
Bullsh*t...
as in the abysmal ex-Premiership team
ah
I dont tend to travle down that way often
i dont tend to get up your way that often ;)
I bounch from her to Oxford a fair bit
orly, not far from me dude
I'm using an intuos3
Have some girly RD
that's a bit of a trek innit?
lol
Relatives plus I love the area
kinda curious and So Cal bronies in here other than me?
and for some reason today it decided to not use my settings with Painter
...WAIT!
OX is a nice area
Port Medow is awesome
I found it...
loaaads of tourists though
Now Painter itself is also full of bugs
It couldn't be any more simpler!
The Eclipse!
I've been out on it 3am lookign at stars and being befined by horses that scared the shit out of me
I hope we see more Fluttershychosis on se2 <3
brb bronies, more caffeine and i need to stretch my legs and do something about this pain in my neck
yet the exact same settings work fine in photoshop and everything else I try them in. Just not what I actually want to use to draw.
If I ever get the chance I'll read A Clockwork Orange. The books seems much better than the movie.
I guess but I tend to go there at less tourist friendly times
When she went all Fluttershychosis.. I wanted to squee so much! <3
yeah, that usually tends to be the case too
ugh
RainBroDash ditto to that
i want more caffine
fuck
im a SoCal brony

You may have overdone it, though...
Heya Vividikins.

Really now? I'll need to start writing my exploits down. That or read more fanfic, there's appearently entire dimensional crossings I've been through.

I always actually liked Good Burger.

Hi... Failure.

Holy hell that's some cosplay http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/25509
Oh yea, NM, you see the one where you forced humanity into a galactic war?

Holy shit.

Last few times I've been here it's been..

No I haven't, I'm currently reading 3 variations on the time when I first came into existance and fought with my sister.
kk
4Could be anything :/
My lung hurt
I will..as soon as i get one.
Getting knocked up on your Xbox is easy, at least for a fem!brony, first you seduce a man, then invite him over to the house...
(OSHI PEOPLE KNOW MY NAME IRL ISN'T ACTUALLY RAINBRODASH)
blah, sexbox 720 is okay
(MY LIFE R RUIN)
back had a quick shave
its not the 'shit' everyone titles it
4Uxie
thankyou dee, i didnt think anyone got that
ohai duMORI, we might be gonna play some xbawks. wanna play?
lol
I particularly liked the whole Elements of Disharmony though.
Why haven't you decided to fight her again, wicked Lord of Shadows?
4one of snds b-crat
yeee
xbawks ftw
If I can remeber how to XD and what game as I don't think I have many
any CoD i think really
You mean the Elements of Discord?
lol
Black Ops most probably peeps?
wait...anyone know how to fix an xbox with a busted diskdrive?
yeah I'm CoD less XD
yeah
black ops
Me, a hero with Celestia a terrible inhumane tyrant? It's been a surprisingly good read, actually.
Yes, that.

Back with a quick spelling nazi reccomendation, and then I'm off xD
lolol
actually, pretty sure discord is the correct spelling there.
stop with the puns please
ZSabotage open it up
*recommendation
It is.

you can replace it with any dvd drive
ooh hey new drawfriend on EQDaily
In the name of Luna I PUNish you!
(i suggest samsung)

wut??
Confound that DarkMemories, he drives me to correct my spelling before I post.
aww sweet!
YAY
DRAWFRIEND
:D
kk just need to get my headset switched up and move some windows onto my other screen, THEN get a beer, THEN i'll get on xbawxcks
Someone please ponify Ozzy. "Bark at the Luna" would rock so much. http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/25509
Oops
It didn't ocpy
Well, chord is the correct spelling.
*copy
fine that was funny, but i ment for bad games like CoD
i might go buy my friends busted up 360 then.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMLwslRNThM
There
sweet
Bark at the Luna
mr. moocow
And dis-chord referes to the absence of proper or pleasing (aka harmonious) chords.
ZSabotage make sure you look up the right drives to use (they sell for like 30-40$)
So, yeah, it's dischord.
ugh I have 1 and a half hour till i need to be out
But, I'm a spelling nazi, a lesser branch of the Grammar division.
odds are i ahve the right drive (I have a crapton of drives laying about)
Funfact, Elements of Destruction are MLP canon
So, jsut something I need to do xD
Been here, feel sorry for Kenan.
I'll gladly discuss your stay in Equestria with Celestia. In the meantime, do try to keep HIM from ruining any plans you may have by going on an all out killing spree across Canterlot?
Yeah, it wasn't just the ending, though. There were graphic sex scenes that caused it to originally be released with an X rating.
What.
G4 canon?
http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/discord
yeah
I think it was G1
13You okay
Ah.
So, outdated canon.
lol rainbrodash my xbox live account got raped by microsoft
so it looks pretty sad
space
Never knew this chat was on EQD. go figure
The Dark Centaur Tirok held them and used them to turn ponies into dark ponies (nightmares).
i dont care dude ;)
the more you know
(hacked my live account, got caught :(
;D
lol
I was watching the movie with a few other people in the dorms freshman year
serves you right
h8rz gonna hate
lol
who hacks games....
and some other people came in the lounge at the worst of times
13TTEchidna has Bureaucrat rights now. If we can get a lot of work done, we'll both obtain the rights
me
but for the fun of it
not for cheating

LOL
Escape from Nightmare Castle
i only mod games, and thats for PC
13He's normally active about a few times a week.
Nightmare? Permission to follow and kill?
where its easier
ive played hacked Halo maps, fun as hell
I thought he turned them into dragons
yes
i mod alot of xbox originals
Really?
Could be
and i mod halo 2
for some reason I feel pirating is much better than actually hacking
I can't remember that well
my computer is a xbox 360
It's on Youtube
yeah xbxo originals are fun to hack
very
wait u use emulator rubnflonne12?
4I'm not sure
I was born '86 so I kind of missed the most of the G1 pony craze..
yup
righto, im on my xbox
4Could be something wrong
thats how i care for the 360 ever
calvin, gamertag?
which emulator?
I watched them as an adult actually.
my PS3 had Linux on it, till sony fucked it all up with an update
last time i checked they sucked
my own
4or a bubble of gas
Though I did grow up watching 80's cartoons. Man I loved MASK and BraveStar
some of the episodes are hilariously bad
4Maybe the way i was laying
=(
yeah of course
Obliveon, you can honestly do as you please, so long as it's not under my banner. I will end you if I so much as hear a rumor that you're doing this for me.
cool
But yeah
(yeah i got linux on my PS3, but i fucked up the normal PS3 partition, so its only a linux box
guys you know there's a whole channel just for roleplay, right?
Quite frankly, I enjoy my quiet nights on the roofs of Everfree Castle. I'd like them to stay that way.
Ozzy should be ponified and had sing "Bark at the Luna" (or "Loon") :B
it's in the topic
6Still so many ponies here...
my gamertag is uklldknnyubstrd
yeah
As you command, Nightmare.
6I'm so used to there being NOPONY after 2 AM
you can reset the defaults calvin
cool got the request
but the massive ammount of talking is done
"Neigh at the moon" would also be acceptible :)
because we are the insomniacs
Sprinkles, it's cause I'm here dude
Well, Captain. It's so much more fun to have a tad of the roleplay element even in the general chatroom.
duh
im only here because im just chilling
i have nothing else to do right onw
ok this video is pissing me off
As I've said before, this is hardly roleplay
=(
i never make it to these things early enough to see the real stuff
one date, three girls

THE POWER OF PONIES COMPELLS MY INTERNET!!!

Yes, I'm in character to a fault, but I'm not spamming the room with giant hufe walls of sun blocking text.
Misti you literally just missed it

yep
MLP is a powerful force
(by like a quarter of a day)
You can catch the restream tomorrow.
"Sun Blocking" I c what u did there
well i saw some of the end pmvs
ill be watching it tomorow
Or is it sun-blocking

Now that hardly seems in character. You should be out there blocking as much sun as possible :P
13Er?
omggotoropleplayloliamgoingtobeamodbecauseIinforcerules.

yeah im a pc gamer
D: y u leave chat
i miss my dreamcast
miss?
mouse > anolog sticks
yeah
i love mouses
4Two more elites to go
agreed duMORI
PC is pretty nice
4Then they all are done
Mongoose|Postal2, spelling's even worse if your lights are out and you can't see where your keyboard is. Unless you've completely memorized the layout of the keyboard itself
analog control is much better with a mouse
brb coffe to fix
4 80/100
depends on the game
Crud, My Password isn't working...what the hell?
Is your monitor too dark to see the keyboard?
LED backlight keyboard ftw
but anything FPS is on computer
and is worth playing
well flight sims are usually the exception
just sleepy.
driving sims too
The computer screen shines enough light for me to see the board. Not like I need it, only rarely do I miss a key.
o crap so poni stuff
i got one of the 20% drunker rbd shot glasses
it depends on how much typing experience you have too
and i've been drinking monster and vodka outta it
yeah isk
fun
idk even...
Is anyone else having issues?
I forgot there were even passwords on IRC, I haven't used it in years
nope
I often just mix up keys due to typing too fast.
chat killer
Of course, sometimes I'll just be tired enough that I type random words.
it's not case sensitive...right?
have you seen renard's mix drink cards for MLP?
i got 3 shot glasses, fluttershy that says party soft, pinkie pie that says party time, and the 20% RBD
yeah i have
i am going to mix them soon to try the fluttershy one
I find myself doing pickle that too
I have no shot glasses as I need MONEY
i need to give some of them a try
I think it is.
:(
oh, look, there it goes
but i would have to buy various things
I heard the pinkie pie waS GOOD
Yeah it is.
Or at least, the password undoubtedly is.
capslock, woo.
I need to read up on my mixing again I'm a bit rusty atm
hmm...I'll try again.
39 bucks was worth the 3 shot glasses
I mean like typing something like "table" when I mean "chair". Random "do"s or "the"s, stuff like that.
i love mine
I want them
4 29/50 Achievements unlocked
And that's how I killed the chat...?
I can understand that
i really want pj pants with cutie mark flanks
it is robots time.
and I'm kind of mid writing at the moment, and 4 other conversations
it has always been robots time.
bucket head?
lol
Chat windows, other browser tabs....
play some guitar!
love old shows like this
yeah
I'm not a pj person
Who wants to know something awkward that happened to me today?
as cool as those would be
kablame would be nice right now
what happened smashed
i like em when it's cold
intreged yopu have me
I was at the mall today
...random lulls...
and I bumped into my former English teacher
yuck
ouch
and her dress and shirt was in the colors of Fluttershy
indeed
oooo...thats gotta hurt
lol
I was trying not to say anything bronyish lol
and yet, you did?
If I met my english teacher I woudl rub my publishedness in their face
well she's one of those no nonsense teachers
really?
so I guess the password isn't working out
thats a bit close minded
does anypony else love how seth's favorite pony seems to change hour by the hour? xD
english teachers suck
haha
so true.
depends i got a few that loved my creative writing
He probably does it for the lols.
maybe his favorite pony is everypony
so he has to
nah they didn't say it but still
=(
13Okay!
he's gotta get even time
Well, he's obviously into unicorns.
love and tolerate bronies
give*
put on some kablam sprinkles
remember
Not *that* way, just likes unicorns best.
sorry :(
the other I had where cool
Except Rarity.
But Rarity's a self-absorbed, fussbudget bitch.
I thought of something productive to do
xP
I'm trying to start a ponyfic, but I can't seem to get the inspiration I need.
work on a simple game I've been working on
And then Seth thought it was a good idea to come in chat
looking at the code for the first time in months
hmm
damn it I alt f4'd the wrong window
I don't feel like doing it anymore
:P
i would to but, meh, im not into fan fics at all
What kindof game?
know of any fun rbd fluttershy ones?
just a simple ice sliding puzzle
i would, but i suck at stories ='(
like they have in the pokemon games
I don't like wrint fan fics
i've been looking for a reason to read a pony fic
Oh, cool.
I perfer writing OCs
it works just fine
only time a fan fic would be written would be after a D&D pony session
and having more grip on what I'm wrting
I was working on an RPG a while back, but the game got corrupted.
there are just some changes I want to make
oh no, that suck
*sucks
Aaand I can already feel my mind slipping away from me. I'm gonna leave before I post something incredibly stupid. Goodnight.
what was it like?
I really need to tie up the short stories I have in to one of those anthology books
hmm
do it!
yopu know a set of short stories linked by another about a char
It was pretty simple. One main quest. Setting was sort of like Dark Tower, if you're familiar with it.
nope, sorry
but I think I need to fix some flaws with Oswald before I try that. He's a bit mary sue and I dont mean him to be
The graphics level was on par with Gold and Silver version. xD
Hahaha
SirSprinkles you are officially my favorite person ever.
i have never been good at getting things on paper but i love to make up storys
just the way he's writen make him seem to 2d
my graphics for this game were made in MSPaint
I haven't seen this show in so long and it's so amazing.
also, I gave it a pirate theme
:P
self.text = self.font.render(("Argh! Ye' found the treasure! Your final score is... " + str(self.score)
anyone willing to do a online session of D&D of MLP FiM?
ah, that's pretty cool
Hahaha, that's awesome.
I'm game.
So pirates in icy waters?
4Almost got Spyro all leveled
yep
no story behind it though so it makes no sense
Looking for Jack Sparrow, no doubt.
I just found my first published work in an anthology of young writers work. I didn't know it had a quoat form Ian Macmillan on the back
:P
ah, yes
up is down
cool anyone else?
Which edition? I do both 3.5 and 4th.
Fuck I'm pround he's saying that about a book im IN!
Well, that's just maddeningly unhelpful.
was thinking doing 4th to make it easier
I'll get a screenshot of the game and show it to you
Doooo it.
(Would keep this Pirates quote going, but I've only seen the third one twice
*)
Haha, it's fine.
or maybe trying that savage world edition of MLP to test it but still figuring it
Erh, internet has finally crapped out for good tonight, stream isn't loading...

Well, gnite bronies!

http://i.imgur.com/iIXml.jpg
yup
yeah it is
13Alright!
I know
there be a poni rules set already
Presea: Yes I sure am alive, . It's great to be alive, isn't it?
Shouldn't be too different from D&D then.
ya i was going to go with that or the 4.0 edition
still deciding
what the f
13Hey, DSD, what level should I reach before the MCP battle? I'm currently on level 63
It might be MS Paint, but you've made it your own art style.
Kenan is kind of a dumbass, isnt he?
I like it.
Thanks
kinda the point x3
really
4What game mode?
he's supposed to be
to be honest I made this game in a single night
13Proud
You should put it up on Kongregate or something when it's finished.
Never watched the show
I think I've had too much coffee
so ya anyone game for the savage world or D&D of MLP?
besides dee
had 2 weeks to do it
on my 3rd cup of ecpresso
Welp...that was stupid
and of course
eh, sure, why not?
maybe
waited til the last night
times would be an issue for me
:P Everyone does it.
does anyone know how to change thier IRC password?
one of the more fun all nighters I've had that was involving homework however
we will try work a schedule around the players
Wow, drawing a pony pic in 40 minutes is not easy, but then again I made it complicated
which is why I intend to keep working on it
what is Kongregate?
I forget how to register my nickname, haha
i can't draw poni
I've never heard of it before
I've got no life, so I'm flexible. XD
4Try 64 for save side
I'm kindo life less
drawing ponies are easy, just gotta practice
lol, I'm doing the drawing challenge for practice. I've gotten a lot better
it's complicated
keeps giving me error messages
4 200 hits so close to 300
cool
what's the challenge today?
Oh, it's just a more legit free game site than, say, addictinggames or Newgrounds.
What happened
island went down
Ah
draw a pony making something. I had me making an apple picker for applejack
woah
cute!
awesome
weird bug that did not exist before
and absol just had a unstable connection to begin with
lets go with the savage rules because thats more set up then D&D
I think I;ve seen your work on EqD
the joke in it is that pinkie pie interrupted the process banging on the door
game freezes when you solve the puzzle
nevermind...
that could be bad :P
I think I liked it too
making something? ur probably going to get alot of pinkie pie
You might have, it's not great but you know what it is
do you guys need the link to the sheets?

and rules?
What a reward. xD
Ich
hehehe
It freezes because of all the ice cubes.,
macking a fan made preqwal to the lingering nightmare and i am going to try to make it tiein with allmost any other fanfics i may be in WAY over my head here (never made a fanfic before)
Would be helpful, I've never played it before but as long as it's as instinctive as 3.5 or 4E it should be simple enough to jump in.
fuck this torrent stuck at 99.8%
now, if I were really dedicated I'd make this but a small part of a bigger game
that does sound a bit daunting
I'd love to join you but sadly I have too much going on to play it right now
Haha, I see what you did there
That's a pretty tall order there rememberme.
alright hold on
Oh, anybody catch the 4chan news?
still its a huge EP dump soo i dont care too mcu
maybe start a...tensy bit smaller
nope.avi
and no it was not going to be on tonight,
Good luck if you really want to attempt it, but I would suggest starting with something of smaller scope.
just getting characters set up and such
they're in another civil war
im just discussing it right now x3
I was of the impression that's their normal state of affairs.
i set high standerds but i may have a way to do it
oh another wooo
well it flared up again to the point they were down for a while
meh anon is allways in war with its self just atm its not anon as they have group names
though I doubt their attackers will be around long, since afterwards they decided to attack cia and bring them down
13Sora, Donald and Goofy are on level 63. Tron is at level 64
13 64's alright, but I plan to break a Level record while in SP
13The record is 86
13 90 if you count Pokemon
Just made a Kongregate account
hi
meh this bisness is just dumb tbh
that cover image is epic.
want to see a game I made that I'm working on?
sure!
http://i.imgur.com/iIXml.jpg
4Wow
it's not playable yet by anyone not on my computer
always reach for the moon, even if you miss you'll land among the stars
yeah, I just ran across it when I was checking out some blistered thumbs news
but there's a picture
it is quite epic
awesome!
stars are much farther than the moon though.
dude at first when I read that I was like oh my god is this gonna be a black themed whore game but then I was like OH pirates
Nightmare, if you're still here. I had forgotten something I wanted to say.
looks cool!
let me see if i can't get the fillable sheets
it's an ice sliding maze, like in pokemon
XD
...Lol.
thanks!
ahhhh yay I love those when I'm not spending 20 minutes on them
So, theoretically, if you were going fast enough to reach the stars, having hit the moon would have been quite painful.
:P
the level that I have right now isn't very hard
So how is everypony doing on this fine...evening...erm...morning....depending where you are...
Your sister indeed has a strange weakness to donuts. Don't ask me how I learned this...
aww here we go
I have some super hard ones though
my friend made them all
http://img268.imageshack.us/img268/4980/snapshot20110618144918.png can anyone make sense of this?
Hrm, so this is the only material? It's weird after years of D&D only having one manual. XD
Wait, wut?
I suck at making mazex
...
cool
Oh right.
She simply can't resist them.
NMM's sister = Celestia
13I brought all six party members to level 85 on FFXII once, and one grew by one level
It's supposed to be ponies building something
this was my maze, and it turned out to be pretty easy
herp derp
Derpy-de-derp
circut, that looks like Rampart, only with a security error
Man, I feel like an idiot.
Her name is DITZY DOO@
!*
Landing amidst the stars = drifting in space, frozen and alone forever.
Not lseeping for four days does that to you
or connection error
Why am I still here?
I am doing fine Paint
Not really a positibe outcome.
13Also, one of my Pokemon in HeartGold (Togekiss) reached level 90
Is it Ditzy, or Bright eyes?
4Why did I not post in color?
I am trying to write more so my I can steal an awesome pic for my fic
Because the power of Celestia compels you! :p
I've heard several names...
I prefer Ditzy.
6COLOR!?
Outline: Unless you land in one, you would be burnt to nothing instantaneously.
0oh, i see
looks like an old game
0it looks alot like Rampart
its dawrf fort IIRC
I don't know how to change it at the moment though
hmm
0or that
0that too
give him guns!
So what, is it supposed to be a pony that made that?
Also, good job at sealing your sister right in front of the sun during the Summer Sun Celebration.
that makes any game better!
jk
And since when is Ditzy Luna and Celestia's sister?
well i use also the savage world core book with this x3 but this is the jist of it
So... the moral here is "Don't shoot for the moon, because space is horrible and everything there will kill you"?
::P
yeah it's that says so at the top is DF
xD
Nah, a flamethrower.
Pretty much
give them unicorn horns or pegasus wings
XD
He'll melt those pesky cubes.
0aww snap, my adobe reader broke.
That was very sneaky, nopony could think of where Celestia was. Except Pinkie Pie...
blah
I should make a flamethrower easter egg
snap
oh you silly fillies going and spoiling inspirational stuff
The only confirmed habitable places in the unvierse is about 1/4 of the earth's surface, and only about 1/3 of that space easily
hit f to fire flamethrower
For a player though this should be all I need?
0and it updated...for some reason
but it just melts all the ice and you drown
pretty much
They're Goddesses. They don't need no stinkin' oxygen.
Magic...No need to explain.
Need? No. But they probably enjoy it.
I'll torrent the core book as I'm intrested
Being able to breath IS nice, I'll admt..
admit*
0now i gotta think of a cutie mark....and i got it
I suppose though explaining magic in scientific terms might destroy a persons brain.
Well, Celestia and Luna aren't the ones aiming for the stars.
Twilight?
Eos?
Nah, she doesn't explain magic
EOS!
I've already got a ponysonna, so I can just use him.
i'll come back to it
trebbles x3
Alicorn of--*shot before secret is revealed*
Hahaha, you should.
0so do I, but mine uses guns...so, thinkin thats outta the question
And how fitting that my cutie mark is a D20. XD
What secret is that?
I hope it has nothing to do with the puppies
Or make it a powerup that allows you to burn one slide.
XD
lol
0aaaaannnnd, all my vector work is on my Linux partition, great.
press p for pony mode
I'll do that
Celestia and Luna throw random objects into space for the fun of it, I'm sure.
it turns the game into a ponyville theme instead of a pirate theme
I got a busy day ahead so I ned to start round shit up.
hehe
Alicorn of whatever Celestial body Twilight Sparkle represents...
And that's the story of how Equestria was made...
Thank you.
ok the kehnan and kel is almost over
i am going to go to bed
sleep wellmib
thanks for streaming all the stuff
But I think it involved more rocks.
it was fun
Equestria was made by throwing junk in to space?
i have (maby) done it!
you need me at a latger date I'll dump my email. saundersmitchell@gmail.com
Hi
I should tell you guys my cutie mark story sometime, it's a doozy!
though I might be back soonish
At least from Pinkie Pie's--yeah.
night all, see you tomrorw for the other streaming
0ruben, anyway we can move this chat to skype or something, so i can boot up linux?
anon out
also aim is Dumorimasoddaa
working on my fanfic now
xD
Carrying over from the RP, I'm Pinkie Pie, so sorry guyz xD
sure skype would be fine
Speaking of the aforementioned 4-dimensional pony...
anyone who wants to join, give your skype names
rubenflonne is mine x3
lol
0zsmith1744
Only 4 dimensions?
Why didn't Pinkie Sense activate any time AFTER Feeling Pinkie Keen?
6...are there still ponies here? Oo
Hrm, have to download Skype, unless it can interact with MSN.
Because nothing of importance happened on those days.
4I'm still here, SirSprinkles
At all.
so am I
im still here x3
6I wasn't really watching, was busy in a GET battle.
well download it, its nice to just have
Psychoshy was pretty dangerous if you ask me. (and pretty sexy) Who said that?
6That I just won by a single point.
13Hey, DSD, what should we do with our YouTube account once we make it?
congratz
sweet!
4Awesome, Sprinks
sprinks play some kablam
does skype have a push to talk feature yet?
I'm just trying to chill down a bit
nope
lame
13Re-mixing some music is a good idea
She had a squirrel between her teeth.
not yet x.x
it's called a mute button
0get a headset thta mutes
0my PSP had that
i have one but i don't feel like breaking the switch
0ya know, when skype on PSP was still a good idea
13And if I could, I'd do some walkthroughs for the first three games and ETD
And not just danger twitches, there's falling objects, opening doors, other stuff...
Hey, squirrels are terrible
I had to take care of a baby squirrel once, and it was an abomination...
DON'TCHU BE DISSIN' THE SQUIRRELIES
I've never seen a squirrel. Reasonably happy about that, to be honest. They sound annoying.
oh well i'll just keep with vent and mumble @_@
okay added you zsab
I was very happen to reintroduce it into the wild
0i got it
I'm surprised there's no Pinkie Sense for "it's your birthday and you forgot"
What pony should you play as?
HA!
XDDDD
4Well first we could have vids on music
@pony
derpy
haha
derpy
perfect
i feel skype would be easier chat system, i don't know how to set up a vent server x3
Can't stand the connects/disconnects
Well, then again. Pinkemena took over at that time.
It bit my mom, because I became to afraid of the thing to bathe it, so she did and it bit through the rubber glove...nasty lil fella.
I'll unjupe it when I get it back online
Pinkie Pie was somewhere else...
There is. Unfortunately, the triggers are "Hair droopy, Angry feeling, allucination"
HAYO
in indiana they eat squirrel soup
Sick bastards.
Wut?
yeah, skype is a lot easier. besides vent tends to have static issues at times since you need a server for it
Hello!
ya
How in the hell did the topic shift to squirrel soup?
*sigh*
Hello...?
Hello there RandomlyWier.
Uh
My friend also took care of an abandoned baby squirrel....and that one was awesome...but maybe he was lucky, or I'm severely unlucky.
I remember darkmemories
But...
4of music in spyro
i'm not a fan of listening to people breathe
You need to be more Fluttershy.
0welp, i oughta boot up linux. brb
where did i saw you...?
Everyone does Andromeda.
*Smashes head over wall*
Probably somtime within the last few days.
no
4Like we could link it to the credits page
I've been pretty active.
Unless the squirrel came from Canterlot Gardens...
Not here
Except fluttershy, of course. She's excatly the right amount.
Minecraft Forums?
Ojhh
Yeah
xD
I'm severely unluckyish just came out of heart sergery.
LOL
oh well +_+ hf with the game!
So... there's now another one of me here....
Now i remember
Everyone clear the area!
You posted in.....
Well hello there xD
It's kinda hard to hear people breath unless they're trying to swallow the mic
*Checks*
mai guide
There are TWO Nightmare Moons!
Ok
lol
I am the real Nightmare Moon!
awesomeness thats 2 people for the list
but they do! lol
Not really
There we go. Pain in the ass Skype site made me have to try registering half a dozen times.
so okay who else wanted to join so i could write your names down
Evacuate via Pegasus if you have to@
and ya it can be a pain
!*
You're kidding? You're kidding, right?
But I'm rambling
I'm intrested if timeing is possable am UK brony
dogs always bark at me randomly
Tell them to move the freakin mic away
You foal, you have no IDEA who you challenge.
Not meaning to be offensive or anything. But the other NMM is here, just going really all-out in the RP channel atm.
i know i guy that has 3 of him in his upcomeing comic that has nothing to do with ponys
sure we can try
And there he/she is! xD
I currently only have skype on my Iphone XD
alright Dee
XD'
I noticed.
/me monologues like a boss.
4Malefor
4I get to fight him
Cats like me...they like seek me out....but I'm allergic.
I'm hiding in a dimensional rift, if you all want to die during a battle between two Nightmares, suit yourselves!
The evil twin of Nightmare Moon?
Pinkie Pie is so there
xD
You mean Trollestia?
Not evil enough.
13Cool~
okay
"I am Nightmare Moon, and I've come to eat your Horcruxes!"
so far
Diet coke of evil?
That fan letter was pretty damn evil...
XD
4Color = purple
Evil, yes, but not evil enough to be the evil twin of one who is already evil.
Trollestia? Not evil enough?
4Cynder=black but purple
/me does not compute
when you hit p, instead of saying "Quest for Booty... On Ice!"
13Okay!
=.=
Trollestia is in it for the lulz.
The fan letter she gave Luna that was fake. That was beyond normal evil.
4Used XD
i am hiding outside of the univers if this gets any more uot of wack
XD
awesome this is going to be fun
13Music videos. There's plenty, but whole remixes are great!
more people the better
Everypony who's in it for the lulz is evil
what in the hell
xd
awkward
You know what's really seriously weird?
I'm used to having no money
XD
OHAI KENAN
Welcome to global economy of the present.
Ha
my connection died
So I usually go "gogdamnit I'm hungry, but I'll just deal with it" until afternoon when I finally eat something.
xD
what I was going to say
UPDATE!
But now that I have money I can just eat since I can buy food properly
Alright, all set.
4Hm
Money is a nice thing
TROLLESTIA IS THE PINK CELESTIA HASBRO TOY@
was now it'll change so it says "Derpy's Muffin Adventure!" instead
And that's weird... because?
4Whats the deal with darkenss in this set of games?
Possibly.
!*
Debt is a not so fun game...that you can't win.
XD
that's awesome
4Cynders evil in the first got that
It's weird because I still have the whole "I'll just try to deal with it" thing going on in my head when I'm hungry as heck
But that's TrollHasbroia.
4Spyro went dark in the second
I need to learn to actually get up and go eat
How do you pronouce that?
I'm not gonna tell anyone but you about this change either
Don't get fat.
4And in the third they both have moments
13Darkness is evil
I was fat once,.
I didn't like it
xD
13That's right
Nothing wrong with it.
I excercise enough
yay
eh, I'm not skinny or anything.
and when I upload the game online I'll see if anyone notices
macking a new pony in my fanfic calling him jack
:P
I have a medical condition that requires me to eat something sugary every few hours
XD
13Darkness appears to be hate and rage
Jack Daniels?
I'll play it in that mode whenever it's done
Hahaha
Diabetes type (1 or 2 forget which)
added
installing skype
*?
4Right
But being hungry makes it really freaking difficult to work on any drawings or projects
hipoglicimc
Hypoglycemic actually
4But Cynder doesn't seem to hate
So.. Breakfast time. Off I go
5 people :3
great turn out
its like bizarro diabetes.
4Spyro just got caught off guard
13She was controlled
I feel the urge to post a link to a certain drawing.
What's sugary enough? Tea with three spoonfuls?
can spell if my life depends on it
But I'm worried about two things.
When my doctor can reffer me to docter pepper...thats an odd day
13it's mostly of negitve emotons
haha
....sorry
4Yea
Andromeda: what are you worried about?
I'll go kick myself now
One: It's on FurAffinity (which I'm part of (bite me if you will))
PFFFFFFFFFFFF
4I thought she had lost them and he does a trick and shes evil
I don't remember this episode xD
Huh? Have I met you before?
just one more time, does anyone else want to join? and if your already in it, can you say it again, so i can make sure i have all your names
Your name is familiar
Do you go to MSPA forums?
Me?
Steam chats?
You
I actually 't drink tea...I have never found a tea I like...
Nnnnooooo.
13I've got the same views on Darkness as Aqua, but I hope the villains can relise their ways and change
I'm a coffee guy, a sissy frozen coffee guy...
4Also it seems Malefor did not take it off
Hmm..
4the chain
Have an account there, yes.
frozen coffee is manly.
Oh well, what's the second point?
4It went poof and came back easy
unless you get the girly flavors. then you're a sissy.
4He didn't even touch it
I like chai tea, and green tea isn't bad as a meal drink... but coffee? No thanks!
what constitutes a girly flavor?
Wut.
13The only ones in the KH series who still have a chance are Pete and Barbossa (once he's revived)
anything that isn't as black as night.
oh my god this is amazin
It's related to DarkMemories earlier sentence: "Don't get fat."
:3
that was my point...
Ah
Anything that's not "black" can be considered girly by some people xP
Hmm
yes this show was so great
peppermin Mocha Frappechino.
In regards to coffee.
There's another drawing too.
13Anastasia's even more evil than Malefor
Super Fru Fru...
With Lyra instead of Luna
Nick was full of awesome at one point.
13So, in the KH series, she's pure evil
I need to get another pony on it sometime
but...its so tasty...
nah i'm actually a gigantic sissy too and i have to make my coffee half milk so i don't cringe.
yes
Yeah, I'll pass the creepy fat things <.<
YAY MOAR LYRA.
Two things really put me off in fanart
/me 4is using Fury mode on Malefor
Unless it's... fat Lyra...
It ain't THAT creepy...
*gulp*
It's kinda like that...
Sweet
Also, that is a great name for a pony...Peppermint Mocha....
13:/
Everything is working so far
:D
I just need to make a Derpy picture
The huge fat things and anthros.
I'd say that's a girly cup of coffee.
HEY!
I love humanized ponies though :B
If this episode were on today there'd be people all up in arms about it encouraging homosexuality.
And now, I must sleep. It's morning somewhere
4Almost done but almost dead
What? Anthros just really put me off
G'night NMM
Anything that isn't based off of a traditional pony body is kinda weird to me, imo.
13Good and bad
Anthro? Yuck.
Are you implying something about Furries?
wait anthros in general or anthro ponies?
if you don't wanna make one I could try my hand at it
I can live with human version of the ponies.
No, I'm just saying it's not my thing at all
But mixing features? Ugh, I don't like it.
4And i won without dieing
Sure!
13Cool!
4and the worlds ending
omg yay
Thanks
:D
13Yikes!
how many pixels should it be
I'm okay with uhh.. Well Disney style. Like those on Treasure Planet. They were great.
But you're not bashing it, right>
?*
13*Please, save us Spyro*
and will westan english media tbh
but still
4See in the cutscene it shows a whole world
55 x 55
D:
You're paranoid xD
I know that's small
alright
4Theres no way it was all done
Just overly sensitive...
but it has to be precise or else it gets buggy
should I make it with the same style as the pic you posted?
13*Gulp*
yeah that's fine
its all stupid here right now x.x
:P
With a bad temper
yeah, that would be nice
alright
I have no reason to bash things just because I don't find the concept attractive.
4More boss fight while we fall
4Reminds me of kh2
yep!! I need something to do anyways
That stuff doesn't bother me much cause I'm a internet veteran...except dirty pony stuff...that somehow is the first thing in long time to make me recoil...
I know I watch your media and news and go OMG
same here
which is why I'm making this game
Let me just say this: How many of you here have killed 6 people in real life?
still our polotics are LAME atm
XD
13Yeah, it does
so nothing planned for the weekend? :P
What.
That's a weird thing to ask
Maybe I shouldn't have said that...
But Anthros...I'm seasoned...I've seen it all...I'm no longer surprised
well, not tonight or tomorrow morning
but there's a carnival in town I want to go to sometime tomorrow
haha
Well porn in general makes me recoil still even though I've been active on the 'net for like ten years.
oh cool
the operition is useless and the coaltion is useing the libdems as fall guys
...did they have to die all at once, or separately?
Just can't see the appeal.
mostly due to the tory media making it so
4I died so i'm restarting
the fair doesn't come here til august
13Who do you think is the most evil Disney Villain (other than Maleficent and Pete) in the KH series?
D:
that's forever!
On the bright side we don't have laws against speaking your mind. Sis was telling me about a recent case in Sweden where a guy was thrown in jail for speaking his mind about homosexuality. While I may strongly disagree with him I think it's ridiculous to be thrown in jail for insulting somepony.
Society avoids me, despite it happening 6 years ago... It was ONE killing spree Illinois! ONE!
xD
xD
that's how I feel with warped which is also in august for me
@___@;
I'm serious.
D:
yeah
Uh huh
wait... sweden, seriously?
I'm not sure how far into this coversation we can go...this is the PG chat, last time we mentioned furries we got a warning....
Yeah.
So I have no rebuttal
nazi opupied contrys have dumb laws tbh
that's the last place I'd think of that happening
http://cdn1.knowyourmeme.com/i/000/107/432/original/i_hug_that_feel.png?1300595876
Why would "furries" give a warning?
weird
Oh Celestia--what gingerale said.
well yeah I guess that might have something to do with it
Well, we don't want it to turn into pornagraphic discussion.
they have huge anit discrimation laws ect
I guess the mod thought things were going down a non PG road
Hang on.
but they GO TOO FAR
Because it's easy to go from Furry to Interent Rules.
But.. There's porn of everything. So you couldn't be able to discuss anything.
Or anythign suggestive, for that matter.
I might go to a concert at the last minute tomorrow but it's not a sure thing
wandering into the Everfree Forest so to speak
You can't discuss the pornographic side of everything.
Why is it that when sombody says furry, they instantly go to pornagraphic things?
But, enough on this.
somebody*
Oh that would be cool
its illegal to disagree about the holocaust to the point of saying that certain touted facts are illogical can get you arested.
The term is stained
who's concert is it?
Sitcom tropes say he gets it wrong.
Oh well
taking back sunday
4The Queen
Because of the sstereotype on the furry community, AKA "Yiff in hell furfag". But again, enoug.
of corse
but if I go it's mainly just to see my friends, I have a couple of their albums though
And people wonder why some of us hate the general public...
thats why when artsits who don't want to be associated with it label themselves "Anthro Artists"
Ok dark enough please.
because It's full of morons?
Yes.
I'm going to stop, yes.
one of my friends was talking about it, and it's her first time in the pit completely by herself since none of her other friends are coming
I was a moron once!
I got better ^^
the creepiest people also seem to be the most vocal
HAVE A COOKIE!
Just going a little to in-depth on my reasons, sorry.
Yaaay!
and one of my other friends is going, and I like the band so I figured I'd ask about going last minute to my mom and she said we might depending on how she feels
/me om nom nom
13She's not as evil as Lady Tremaine and her daughters, though
oh man
that's classic
Oh cool
13Remember when they tried to murder Cindy?
I'm one of the quiet ones. They never expected me to kill...
that should be fun
the vocal minority is a big thing in most fandoms/general areas of interest, though.
yeah, if I get to go
Yeah.
I hope so
yeah
Okay, I'm going to call it a night. Take care, all!
niight.
i added you Dee just letting you know
G'night mate.
they have bands at this carnival tomorrow too
Like drawing characters like that is fun, you can d alot of things with it...but then theres those really loud weird guys, that wear the suits...
13That was pure evil. Even Aqua senced their HUGE amont of darkness by just passing them
and stuff
the show's not too bad
And I'm gonna go eat cheesecake!
but you have to be 21 to go to the concert
do you know the names of any of them?
ahhhh
that sucks
i want cheescake.
because there's implied drinking involved
jarrod gorbel was in town tonight and I couldn't go because it was at a bar ;___;
aye
Me too...
Oh!
which sucks I love him so much
My breakfast!
I forgot
/me is off
his last show here was 21+ too
4Yea
are you kidding
Oh yeah
I was wondering why he hadn't left earlier.
it's more than not too bad
I noticed. Looking over these rules while I wait to get an invite to the chat.
and faster pussycat in july is 21+ but we might sit outside and listen for that one
I'm one of the quiet ones too
I have a sudden craving for bacon
NOSTALGIA TELLS ME SO
But I have military training
13Even I made a video to show how evil they really are: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dr8WXLvJGt4
\o/
Breakfast?
I used to watch All That
Off again!
anyway night everypony
Oh wait.
It's almost 4 am
night apple
xD
see y'all next frahday, ya hear?
2:37 here.
Lol, insomnia is cereal business
oh my god you're right. ._.
i don't want to go to bed though.
alright i will start up a chat in a moment
I'm quiet, and have four swords, and 2 clubs stashed around my house
can you send those links again ruben?
Yeah, if that would work that would be cool
sure
I prefer knives of any kind.
13There is nothing nice about them. They are ugly, selfish witches who tourcher others to get their own way.
on skype or here?
i know karate, kung fu and several other dangerous words.
Oh cool, apparently I convinced MadMax to go play Amnesia *proud* :B
Off once more!
xD
Any burgular that comes in here is going to get the broad side of a claymore
Lol
Slice, slice, cut, cut, slit, slit!
Can't wait to see that reaction.
I bought Amnesia.
I still haven't played it.
xD
I'm a wuss when it comes to horror games.
I love horror novels...
yeah and it's on a saturday
13Put all the villains you know into one, then times it by three. The trio are even more evil than all that
Probably be back here tomorrow too, or rather today since it's Saturday here. XD
Amnesia will fix any wussiness over horror games
I can't get enough horror film...
The red starts pouring out their necks then they hear me SING!
I labled one of the clubs "Stun" and the Machete "Kill"
faster pussycat was my first concert ever I was 8 years old
But I just can't do games.
Wouldn't you rather that burglar get the sharp side of said claymore?
Once you're through it no other game will feel good enoguh xD
I want to see them again so bad or at the very least hear them live!!!
:C
doesnt matter
4Almost killed him
I played Dead Space after it and I was just singing to "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" happily at that one point
Yeah, that would be really cool
Actually, the claymore isn't even sharp anymore...except for the tip
4Just missed a button
MAKE US WHOLE!
There's NOTHING scary about Dead Space for me
so I'd have to poke him to death
Lol
Oh
Danit
Breakfast
13Okay
*darnit
Off agaiiiiiin!
I think that's cool that you've been going to shows since you were
8
oops
stupid enter key
What was that other game made by the same developers?
STEP THREE!!
I'm pretty sure it started with a P, or M or something
x3 well let me get you all in a chat
Cross my heart and hope to die...
13Barbossa may be evil, but he's most likely to become a neutral character in a future game
circuit would you like to join? or nah?
Stick a ne--cupcake in my eye...
or sprinkles or ghosties?
4I would, but sadly, I'm sleepy as shit
13Gantu, also, should he ever return in a future game
/me sticks his arm out, and turns it
4God he doesn't die even when you hit beat him twice
4I appreciate the offer, though
Penumbra, but you could fight the monsters on it so it's not as good
/me then takes his hand, puts it in his mouth, and gulps
yeahh
/me then makes an outline around himself
13I'll say
You mean hoof, right?
Darnit, where is that shirt of miiine? Got to get dressed properly finally. (Past 10 am) :I
/me puts an arm within the outline
done with the rough draft of my fanfic here is it any good https://docs.google.com/document/d/11_ETMXlvbZCATU4Nawn-WEigPcCQfDAVg_AXstXMelc/edit?authkey=CMPz3ugC&hl=en_US
I want to eat at Pirate Hank's.
I'm surprised I even remember it all; it was father's day and so my mom bought tickets for us all to go, my dad had me hooked on them since I was 2, since it's 80's music that's one of the bands he was really into back in the day
well we are not starting it soon x3
rememberme: #EquestrianStudy
we are just getting set up and contacts
They discuss stuff like that
AHH!
and the venue was really small, I don't even think it's open anymore
Breakfast!
HAHAHAHAAA!
ok
and figuring times x3
Forcing schizophrenia on yourself isn't easy...
But I did it. ^^
oh hey
Gives me someone to talk to.
sorry for being off topic, but I just wanted to let you know that when you hit p the treasure chest turns into a giant muffin
XD that's awesome
Fluttershy, Fluttershy, oooh Flutter Flutter Flutter, Fluttershy!
This chat could very well be a manifestation of your schizophrenia...and we are all voices.
Never thought about that.
4I need to fury the third part
4Fury!!!
But, I AM demented after all...
Oh man, I broke prime directive...I wasn't supposed to tell you that.
Reverse psychology.
6What's going on now?
I hate thinking of ideas that sound like they came from a stoners mouth.
Which is why I contradict and plan EVERYTHING I say...
getting ready for a MLP D&D would you like to join sprinkles?
My Little Pony: Friendship is Savage.
6...YES
we are just getting contacts out of the way and plesentries
6I love D&D
good :3
Wait, are you implying that I'm on drugs?
cool
rubenflonne is the skype name add me and i will get you in the group :3
I think I was implying I'm on drugs
OHAI GUISE HOW IS TING
which I'm not
hai
but I often sound like it
13DDD's gotta write new plotlines for the worlds
13I'm sick of having to repeat the story for Agrabah, Wonderland and Olympus Coliseum in THREE games
13But, the game's got one new world. I just hope those gypsies won't gag Sora or Riku like they did to the main characters in the film they came from
soo much caffine so twitcy
You're right Andromeda. Fluttershy fits that song so much better than Lollipop.
13Remember the song "The Court of Miracles"? That's what I meant
sooo twitchy :P
so much Kel
Caffeinne is a drug.
4RainBroDash, seemingly awakening from idleness
It's interesting when you look at how you talk online, and then you look at how you act in real life.
I's playing CoD with a brony
4Ah
don't be hatin' now
It makes you think, "Wow. I wish I really was that guy..."
4Hey, you can enjoy whatever game you like
For instance, in an alternate universe where everyones gender was reversed, if you were to go there and date your female self, would that be "incestous?"
:D
<3
4Even if it does suck :P
:P
hmm
It means you have an extreme ego, I know that much.
That's sortof not a good topic for this chat.
I'm proud of that one actually, I came up with that gem at a bonfire
what should the obstacles be?
just cos I don'r enjoy dosen'r mean I hate it
4wow
6...skype...that might be an issue.
The internet had that idea first, for the record.
6I have to check and see if it's blocked.
Well, I didn't want to start a dialogue about
it
welcome to Rule 63.
not sure...@___@; I'm not good with stuff like that haha NO BRAINPOWER ALLOWED WITH ME
workin on the derpy eyes though
well if it is, we will work on something else :3
I didn't know...at the time, this was years ago
Okay, no more on this I suppose.
4i got two of the Achievements for one go
Oh my Celestia it never stops...
I was merely giving an example.
Ehh. I think my internet self and actual self would probably hate eachother.
4Beating his lair and beating him with out dieing
4 32/50
I talk far too much here.
heres a safer topic
i concor
haha, nice. I was thinking clouds maybe
My self would kill me online...
13Cool!
4And i got the game yesterday
i'm very quiet in and out of chat.
4Wow
probably stupid though
This hasn't gone unnoticed Balloons :P
xD
13Wow!
BALLOONS! No, CANDY! NO, STREAMERS!!!
My internet self ischarismatic and happy with whatever the hell happens, while my IRL is like Fluttershy, only more secretly hating the guts of everybody aorund me.
if there were an infinite number of alternate universe, and you had a choice of which one to live in, which would you choose?
why woudl they block skype
DarkMemories. My twin.
Hahaha
where the hell are you?
This one. I love this one.
xD
6Cafe
or just Pinkie Pie making an evil face
6It's not blocked.
XDDD
awesome
ah
6But some of the most RANDOM things are blocked.
4And Malefor lost to dead ghosts
I'll do balloons
I like that idea
Misanthropic eh Dark.
I would live in the one that's exactly like this one, only Billy Mays didn't die
lol
Only IRL.
I was kidding but that could work :P
thats the kind of answer I like to hear.
:P
13Sweet!
I flip and flop between misanthropicness...
I would live in the universe that represents my imagination and fantasies, or Equestria, or what DarkMemories suggested.
But I hang around the minorities like this on the internet, where there're actually intelligent people, so I can actually enjoy conversing.
I will simplify it by saying every trip to wallmart is a ruined day
I don't get to choose who I be around IRL.,
4Nice world is saved
So I end up with idiots.
xP
Like children
I hate children
its frezzeing in the frezzer OMFG
Wallmart is kind of like a mueseum...
wtf is that place
/me works with children
13That's right!
Hate them... so.. much...
of Souldead...miserable people...
do you need my name again for skype sprinkles?
4Dragon is stars looks nice
walking meatsacks with moutholes, with little failure trails behind them...
@ Paintsplash, I'd probably head to a universe where the technology to freely travel between these universes had been developed, and the people were responsible enough to refrain from abusing it.
DarkMemories: You're hanging out with the wrong people IRL.
13Hm
I mean, my roommates are kind of anti-pony.
I want to kick my siblings' in the teeth every single time I see or hear their voices...
4Now i want true ending
I mean, I don't get a choice.
grimdark much?
13Yes, you sure do
Nope.
But they're not going to get on my case for it.
Outline, I'd go the same way pretty much...the ability to visit ther unvierses in said universe is sort of the "infinite wishing" rule.
4I still think my plot idea would tie it all in
....wow my derpy sucks :C
Oh I hate my family...
13True
I love that word...
And I met them on the internets.
Grimdark...
actually, I feel nothing...I'd say thats worse
what's this you guys be up to?
I live in the area where there are both no PC gamers out of the gaming population, and there're a bunch of influxes of ghettos populations.
oh, D&D?
cause at least if you feel...you care.
Point, but think about it. A universe where people could travel to wherever they wanted to go, but didn't see any need to do so. That'd be a worthwhile place to be, imho.
Grimdark.
13What's your favourite world in the classic series?
Cupcakes
4Hm
Confound these consoles.
4Thats a tuff one
They drive me to drink.
I see the other Nightmare Moon is still here.
A world where communism works.
4They are all good
if you don't wanna use it that's fine lol
13I like Shady Oasis, but I would like any world
it looks awful
6It's the same as your chatname here, yes?
13They are all good!
Can you down 6 bottles of vodka and stay sober?
Hahaha, no that's good, I'll use it
13That's right!
you sure?
It's fun and easy.
without the 12 i think
yep
My workday for the last two weeks has been fighting with the PS3.
hurray then
(conversation invadin')
:P
For once, I lol'd.
KILL
Sup everypony
finally got service back?
Also, drink.
BEER IS GOOD.
AND STUFF.
13What about in the KH series
LET'S GO DRINK SOME BEEEEERRRRR!!!
Blegh. Beer doesn't smell nice, I can't imagine it tastes any better.
yes but without the 12
It's actually delish
ya D20 MLP
13What's your favourtie?
Esp. with dried, salted squid
Good beer? Hell yes.
Cured squid?
savage lands
I'm clean...I'm not a beer person...or a smoker, but I respect your right to smoke and drink as you please
Sounds good!
cave men invented beer
lol neopets
my bilge dice options just now were "6 6 6"
Rememberme is Nostradomus
Just...don't smoke near me....I am actually allergic...
I'm Japanese, so it's something that's always gone with beer for me
I don't smoke.
XD
who
I drank during the six years ago where I went on the K-spree.
I surprisingly get that score on neopets alot
I'm Finnish so everything goes with beer to me 8D
dun dun DUN
lol!
One of your identities I'm sure smokes.
wow, why hasn't anyone tried to kill him?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY4-pJ0icfk
Multiple Personality Disorder or not, I stay away from those..
I'm fermenting some organic cider as we speak and I'm gonna make applejack :D
Genius
13DSD?
Damn I could go for some döner kebab today for lunch :(
xD because he is awesome
ha
lol
how about now?
Heineken has me singing that damned song...
LMAO
XD
Ever had kebab?
Food of the gods themselves
xD now he is dead
Oh man I wish...
Depends, is kebab what I think it is?
I just had an ide for a pony that runs a night club and maks his own wine
I could go for a cheeseburger right now
It looks good....
rememberme: I have an OC called Malt Lager :B
BURGER TAAAAANNK!!
And yes, I've eaten kebab.
Bacon, Mushroom, Montery jack cheese burger
It's grilled stuff on a stick.
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/54/D%C3%B6ner_kebab_in_Helsinki.jpg
I had kebab earlier this week
This is kebab
Not some stick stuff
This is proper kebab
saved by dumb luck
CroupDockHaunch: I've had apfelwein in a fermenter for, uh
cho all I GTG
That looks...awesome
Getting close to a year now. I should probably drink that.
later
take care
It's delicious as heck
I would eat that
lol!!
Bacon, provolone, barbeque sauce, green peppers, onions, and if I'm feeling weird, chocolate sauce on top.
Or bottle it or keg it.
now I am hungry
German, Scottish, Irish, and Canadian... do those mix?
Oh god, now I want gyros.
are you a teenage mutant ninja turtle man?
And beer in a fermenter for... seven months?
DarkMemories you are now Celestia's personal chef
xD
I'm honored
whats yours sprinkle?
My mom makes completely boss umeshu
It comes in different forms. Inside a pocket of pita bread, with rice, garlic potatos, fries.. And then of course kebab rolls.. Rolls of that stuff and sallad wrapped inside a roll made out of of pita bread dough.
Best. Things. Ever.
6Sprinkleburg
alright
gtg its 4 in the morning here
It's 4 in the morning here.
hey, its also 4 in the morning here
I wonder if a food addict is reading this somewhere and... doing whatever food addicts do or something..
I'm still up.
xD
Clop?
4Not sure
Yes.
One roll can weigh like an entire kilogram easily.
Oh god, THAT would be weird
4I like them all even the backgrounds
Confound these ponies.
/me 4is in his sandbox working on stuff
Thoguh I guess some people are just that into ood
They drive me to think crazy.
wonder what happened to Kel's career
Meh. If you'd had the foresight to be born on the correct part of the planet, it'd be 4PM now P
13Your KHwiki userpages says you like Space Paranoids!
13:)
Creme fraiche!!
13Same here!
http://i.imgur.com/4A3qb.jpg
tada!
I mean Kenan is on SNL now, but kel....
added
2:00 roundabouts here
6pm here. xP
PM
I read some of the clopfics here and... I gotta say...
xD
Some ponies are just Luna ponies.
who knows what happened to kel
Wow
omg
those balloons are awesome
4am over here
Thanks!
Celestia and Twilight go together WAY TOO WELL...
derpy wants some baked bads
4 AM here too. Ow.
any trumpet players in here?
XD
I am glad this is not a weeknight.
maybe it should be movie....thing....imdb!
LOL
I just saw that episode today
sucks though...I have to get my car worked on at 9:30...
on tv too!
not the internet!
Psh
what's up w. it?
I play Trombone
Violin
Liek a baws
yeah it was on this morning right??
12nooo
:P
I was watching it too
I'm an amatuer guitar player, which in no way is a trumpet and doesn't help you sorry.
mhm
Thoguh also secondary in Euphonium/Baritone, Tuba, and Piano
I mean, I overslept Wednesday night because I stayed up until 5 AM drinking Twilight Sparkle.
And tequila.
Acoustic...
Like a monarch
@DarkMemories: Is it foolhardy to try to teach oneself a brass instrument?
Not any moreso than... Well, any other instrument.
lol pro play Zebranky
[!Isukra vars reset]
I'm self teaching myself Cello.
Octavia!
It's going quite roughly to say the least xD
Hmm, Pink Panther and pals, and battle: los angeles
I know how to play just about everything on earth you don't have to blow into
Octavia plays a contrabass.
Not a cello
So I figure trumpets are reasonably inexpensive
CroupDockHaunch: I think I love my job. :P
F*CK
(thankfully I didn't have a meeting that morning)
Back to fics...
I hope Trixie returns.. I want to see some rival yay between her and Twi. :B
Why is it that 80% of RD fics have her falling from the sky?
Fanon?
It's easy drama
How does the trixe/twilight pairing work out?
It's hawt.
They're frenemies, obviously
Twixie is my favourite pairing
i hear its for comedy
Not hot or sexy, wrong chat for that
But it's cute.
Twilight, Celestia, and luna during We're Gonna Party Like 999 is hot to the point of audible giggling.
I hear a skype
They aren't so different...
It's just adorable ^^
I'm not sure how to phrase the rest
6Yeah, it just started up when I finished installing.
They're sort of doppelganger versions of each other
so how goes the worblegorble in here
Rarely seetrixie paired with anyone else but twi only seen one and thatswith snails
I hope G4 ends with a movie where Twilight takes her place as the Princess of Equestria while Luna and Celestia leave to join the stars.
dude
6TIME TO WRITE
6AND IT FLEW REAL LOW
I could just stare at the screen pressing p again and again all day

Oh

G5 is gonna be awesome
when the show has ground out everything enjoyable based on being on too long...
I also ship Trixie with Fluttershy
but will get a lot of movies knowing because mlp does heck of a lot of em
G5? I can't even imagine G5.
play seashells
It's too awesome to imagine
G5 will be IN SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
My little brony friendship is epic full colt cast what a twist
12Floof
12back
It's like Star Trek but with ponies
No space.
is that a flash game?
They had a th3350m3 in Celestia's bed. I thought, "*girl squeal*" after reading that part.
wb
12Thanks
...I was quoting mlp XD
I'd love to see them do an episode entirely with male ponies...like a backgorund group of friends.
Celestia, Luna, and Twilight, that is.
6lol if you're talking to me I can't hear because of the stream being so loud
IT'S UH. A BIG HOUSE.
Something like that, Tena
oh XD
HARRY LIKES TO COLLECT VOLLEYBALLS AND PLAY SEASHELLS
my bad
hahaha
forgot all about that
next generation?
I hope we get to see a grown up applebloom
My Little Puppy: Cuteness is D'AAAAWWWWW
Or wait no
omg
Side series.
On G5 it will be revealed that Equestria is actually a huge spaceship
I haven't tried actually playing the game as derpy yet
And sun and the moon are artificial
I think it'd work out...
XD
12^v^
you should see it
An Articuno
Heya Articuno :o
it's so cool with her face sliding around
In a way that like some sort of plot you don't know about is going on with the mane cast, meanwhile Bic Macintosh and others are doing stuff that the show is focusing on.
XDDD
@PaintSplash: Already doing that with the female CMC, I'm sure they don't want to do it with another group, especially one not beneficial to a young female audience.
/me hugs all
Hmm..
12hi
Fluttershy can't NOT be in an episode.
I'd upload it right now so you could play
cool, skype is fun
it's what I use for my live show
AND IT FLEW REAL LOW
Or else it won't be as good.
apparently
Good point
but it has a problem where it freezes when you win...
She wasn't in...
Skype is hella fun
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/21055?search=star_trek hows about this
Hmm.
D:
Okay how about this
so that would probably make your internet browser crash
Flutterdata!
:C
Flutterborg.
Hayo!
don't worry about it
probably should've been focusing on that instead of on making this pony mode
the entire universe is Luna's dream as she sleeps restlessly on the moon
BUT THAT'S NOT FUN D:
Oh dear..
XD
You shouldn't have done that.
D:
omg
hey how do you directly acknowledge someone? Just @name?

I don't know how bad the actual Detroit is
Hola Everypony
Its the only city I know thats half abandoned...in the US
!setgen status
1st Gen: on · 2nd Gen: on · 3rd Gen: on · 4th Gen: on · 5th Gen: off
yay
gingerale: I've basically heard "Do you want to play Fallout without actually playing it? Visit Detroit."
Heh
You know how they exaggerate how much Cleveland and New Jersey suck?
There are entirely abandoned skyscrapers...it is fallout.
4and theres the ending
ST_Falcon: New Jersey hurts.
That's pretty cool but I wouldn't visit it ^^
Every time I drive through it
There's two places they're NOT exaggerating about.

Now when you get on the stage you realize you're warming up for some new teen star so the crowd is full of pre-teen kids. The question is, what will you play to them? :B
Whatever.
Witha ll that we've imagined...
The reality of this night is sure to make this...
The Best night EVER!
The end?
Well considering I started watching this 1t 10 pm yesterday and it was already on the way and now it's 10:25, most definately

4Hah, yes, that is true. You're almost in every thread I lurk in
I just lurked on ponychan once. Two weeks ago actually, which is when I heard about this
I ordered Rock Band 3 and the keyboard peripheral for 360
Stream be over?
this is where it gets spotty...theres chorus under the lyric
Hungry ponies, they will buy them, caramel apples apple sweets
ugh, listining to it makes typing it out impossible
D: D:

Amazon sent me the keyboard only for PS3

and We'll have the BEST NIGHT EVER!
AT THE GALA!
If I didn't have a low voice, I would totally cover that song.
xD
^----
I'm a good singer, but... I'm stuck in the nether regions of the bass clef
Yeah, I can't actually pull it off. I like to think I can sing, but my range is... limited.
Greetings Everypony
/me brohoof
I can do treble, but it starts getting a little to falsetto
..am i the only one that has tiramisù for breakfast?
I have a range I have to sing in, or I crackle...Like...Jonathan coulton range but ni higher
Exactly.
Let's just say...
I sing like Rick Astley.
I had a teramisu cake pop a little while ago
xD
I think I will shove that into drf's face later
Sort of been rickrolled...I think
Well, it's not my fault you thought of it
when I hear his name, I think the song...therefor you got me
You didn't have to think about Never gonna Give You Up
Now, seriously
03o.o
He has others songs, it's just they're more obscure, so you probably haven't heard of them.
Can you tell me with a straight face that Rainbow Dash *doesn't* sing in all caps?
I listen to Rick Astley before he went manestream
Yes.
I was born the year Never gonna give you up was top of the charts....
crap
xD
I forgot how to change the hostname
I hear your opinion and promptly discard it.
At least that was when pop was good
POST
Music is unfortunate now
Well, sorta, as good as pop could be
We're talking about music?
Yes, quite.
And... yes, quite.
we just got there
I'm listening to Black Album on Record right now.
We tried sing-a-long-ing At The Gala.
But it faile.d
No miserably, but if failed.
aww
I watched get him to the greek, and the music from the fake band "Infant Sorrow" was better than todays music.
Todays music is not BAD... I enjoy some
But nothing is GREAT
Still: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEbFXzZiuG8
This is going to happen.
With bronies.
Volbeat is GREAT
And it's today's music
I would totally perform that live
xD
And sing lead if they'd let me
My pitch sucks when I have allergies, like right now
but I'm quite good after clearing my throat and warming up xP
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEN3mQ0ql30 <3
heh, Volbeat.
See?
I was my friends rockband frontman....I was the best singer out of 10 people...plus I was bad with the instruments.
Today's music and it's great
ohsi
ohai*
Only because it's based on Pokemon
hi
I got a woman's deodorant commercial.
!chatstats
Chat stats updating.
Dark? What the heck are you watching? xD
Something tells me I've been watching too much MLP.
maybe you haven't heard manestream music....I can't listen to 106.1 without wanting to puncture my eardrums
xP
But
12OMG that took AGES >v>
Volbeat is mainstream
Music is like candy bars
... since when?
12The code on that page was SO badly written and messy
It's better once you throw out the wrappers
I don't think they play that on 106
This is the first time I've heard this song
12I had to clean it all up first
I am kinda sick of music for the most pasrt
part
Since they got sold out whenever they play live?
I'm talking about what the dregs listen too...
I listen to my WHOLE library on shuffle
I like instrumental music
And I pop between, uh...
and my library is mostly POKEMON BGM or YTMND THE SOUNDTRACK
so, not music
And J-Pop, but that's a different xtory from my weaboo times xD
lol
So really; I will listen to anything
Five or six stations when I'm driving
DarkMemories: Where did you get advertisement like that? xD
The deodorant thing
Pokemon music is not BGM?
I've a split between classic/brit rock, and Game stuff.
Before the YT vid of that song.
I mean, Pokemon BGM is not music?
and some MLP stuff...
lmfao
It's plenty sure music
It's BGM and then... WEIRD HIGH PITCHED JAPANESE STUFF
probably not as bad as mine
Give me either good vocals or *really* good instrumentals and I'm in.
It's hella good instrumental music.
I don't think you've heard about 90% of the pokemon music I have
lol
I don't have winter wrap up...but it never grew on me that much...compared to like Art of the dress, or At the gala...
Wut?
Unless it's not from the games.
it's not from the games.
I have all the game music.
I know...I know, Heresy
peabnuts123: ^5
Not a single sing
The anime?
high fives
yes
xD
and it's mostly the japanese anime
Oh yeah
BROHOOF
and live shows and stuff
Well, the game music is music
And good music
The game music is AWESOME
peabnuts123: i have nearly all the songs from all the sonic games
beat that.
The list of bands playing downtown during a weekend in about month http://www.tuska-festival.fi/?sivu=esiintyjat
^^
Hmm
Right here downtown
I doubt I could beat that
I have the soundtracks to sonic 1-3 and knuckles on my Ipod
But I have... all of.. the YTMND soundtrack?
and I am nerd shamed
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3UT8bfp0ow
I have a shit tonne of Powerpuff Girls music on my phone
That's pretty cool
oh my, i was beaten hard
:|
And then http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pKByy53JY
argh damnit, this thing is making me set up IPv6
/me bawwwwwwwwwws
Octavarium is a masterpiece
But I listen to Six Degrees more
(like every day)
That live performance is absolutely *spectacular*
yea
peabnuts123: They did all of Six Degrees at that show too.
Hah
I know, man
(the suite, anyway)
I have the album
Well, while I'm still thinking about BGM, I gotta say that these two BGMs are among my favorites of all time:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNvHGXbdO5I http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfgZOTuu6J0
Funnily enough
Good, just checking ;)
The Record I'm listening to now
I didn't have a lot of time so I could only check 1 store
They didn't have any DT; but they did have Black Album for pretty cheap
12Meowing Lugia = THE END OF THE WORLD!!!!
I went through a phase where I gathered every DT bootleg and B-side I could from the internets
So DT is the reason I'm listening to this right now
Oh god lol
There is some really obscure, *really* awesome stuff.
haha
hipster much?
I can never ever be fucked looking for B sides
I think my favorite obscure track is Kevin Moore's demo of Space Dye Vest.
>implying that the word obscure automatically means hipster
12Articuno page is done ^^
Where it was just him singing and playing piano (and his samples)
Cool man
Nothing beats Propaganda from Beyond Good & Evil
ù_U
Lemme put that up...
But I admit
I haven't made it around all their albums yet
They have like
9001 hours of music
I calculated their average song length
nice :3
It was narly 9 minutes e_e
I always took hipster to be wearing and doing things to be ironic.
heya
Even without Six Degrees on Score
Hey
12Now for the Lugia page >v>
Oh, and the demo for "A Change of Seasons" (which was originally supposed to be on Images and Words)? Beautiful.
Like when I watched scott pilgrim, I culd best describe as a film for guys who wear game shirts, and hats but don't know anything about the games themselves.
Hahahahahahahaa, I hadn't seen this one before xD http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/25312
That was while they were auditioning other singers.
lol
So awesome
Scott Pilgrim is supposed to be good?
You know what's ironic in a hipster sense
@PaintSplash: Yeah, same.
Big Bang Theory.
Anyone home?
Heya Sam
There weren't enoguh actual game reference IMO, rather than just game cliches >.>
Big crunch, heck yeah!
Plus most of the characters were cnsistently unlikeable
Man
I do not understand Scott Pilgrim
but what do I know, I watched Avatar for the story...not the experience...and disliked it immensely.
xD
I heard about it first when that film came out
Welcome back to Pocahontas
I need to watch it; it's supposed to be good
I hated Avatar.
But then I find it it's like... a comic...
bloody hell, I hate setting up IPv6
But it's drawn like a web comic
I don't even
it's always such a pain
I liked the visuals and concepts in that regard.
Only thing it's good at is the 3D.
Sam
gtfo
I kid
I think the guy who made Scott Pilgrim...sold his sole to get fame...
But seriously
*soul
lalalaalaa
What isn't, man
Cameron could've done better with it, really.
indeed
Films today are generally boring
In idea
indeed, that was my issue
They are quite watchable
I can't wear 3d specs...I get sick
yes
12Why? ovO
so
yeah
but there hasn't been a classic film in a while now
whats up
all 2 of you
MLP:FiM has no really original plots, I may add.
and the story was so 2D
But they're entertaining at least.
Unlike most other things.
xP
nothing much
3d is such a gimmick and I continue to boycott it
There are no original plots anymore.
Well, I have to go for a week.
Watching boast busters
Goodbye, everypony!
I like Avatar, it was really pretty; but it was just a closetFur plot
:D
We ran out of those like 3000 years ago.
Really quiet. You have to crank it up.
Bye DarkMemories ;_;
Well...being creative is telling the same story in such a new and different way people don't notice its the same
I'll miss every one of you. Well... most of you.
xP
Bai
lolcats
bye
But one of the most obscure, and maybe one of the most haunting DT tracks you'll ever hear.
bye
I can't Zbranky
Because my brain is full of pony!
My vinyl is playing lol
oh nice
12ovO
I'll tab it
03what
Well, save it and listen later :P
03I just rebooted my desktop
03now I'm going to bed
YAY
:D
12LOL
03the fan I had in here originally sounded like a jet engine was taking off
I thought the Sci-fi elements in Avatar were cool
http://scans-daily.dreamwidth.org/3055836.html xD
03I was like no, and shut it down
the problem is that sullivan didn't do his fucking job
Read it!
also browsing the picasa page me and a few other bronies made on a forum
03trying liquid cooling and having bad luck with it :/
I EAT YOUR SANDWICHES
I EAT EM ALL
cool
oh man
SO LONG
My modern day attention span is too short for this comic
mhm. Ponies everywhere! The forum is about Gran turismo the video game
12Fans always put me to sleep
yes but the characters were so cookie cutter...
lmfao
03want these ones then? They sound like a roaring engine
12probably because they drowned out all the noise my parents used to make past 11pm >v>
So?
Well Articuno, have you ever tried setting up IPv6?
12Nah, I don't keep my computer in my room anymore
What isn't these days?
I can't say that makes it right
Ever see Red letter Medias avartar review?
But it's wrong to expert quality from anything
that pretty much says it all
You can't have depth in this economy!
3671 replies since may 5th
heh well, depending on whether you have a native block or not, it gets really annoying
You here Sprikles? Just got back.
This is a controversial film for some reason
but I think one of the only classics of recent times is something like Watchmen
if you don't have a native block you have to set up your connection to tunnel through something like he.net, configure your router to allow ICMP pings, etc. and then route a lot of stuff for it to work
Sprinkles hasn't been talking, so I guess no
and I never read the novel
12o-o
Also, the point of Scott Pilgrim is that Scott IS a douchebag. He is a complete dickhole.
12RAWR
if you have a native block, you have to configure your interfaces for it to work
12what's the rules for rebirthing in mabi?
Hence Michael Cera?
and because this VPS hasn't properly assigned me a block, they screwed up and now I'm going ffffffffff
The comics go much more in depth with this, obviously.
But pretty much everyone was
in the film
The comics are weird; man
12how often can you do it
It's like a webcomic
But published to paper for some reason
Yep.
-has a problem with this-
I like Comic stories...but I can't comment on Pilgrim...
I never read the books...
Don't really want too though
whatevs.
I also swear it's not native and it's being tunnelled through he.net, but maybe I'm just doing it wrong
sooo
Once a week (with cards) and free rebirth at the age of 21
how's everyone doing?
or 20 can't really remember that well XD
the only book I can say I now I'd hate...is Twilight.
Zebranky
peabnuts123
but thats lit, not comic
Not that I know of.
Lots of really limited CD releases.
I know I bought an massive super edition of an album for a friend
1220
It had a record in it I'm sure
:o
And http://liftingshadows.com/
AWESOME
12i thought that you can rebirth after every saturday at 2PM
128PM your time
Welp, that was fun.
neat
Oh ncie
I just got hte best idea

Nope once a week
NICE*

Hi

Okay, maybe it is right

Dammit. Now I wish I had bought the original edition of Lifting Shadows.
Did you know she released the video for Edge of Glory on her website.
memememe
I gotta go to sleep...night everypony....Or rather good morning
night
awesome!
Hating Twilight means that you're sane.
Book or pony?
Book, duh.
lol
Have you seen the movie Vampires Suck?
No.
It makes fun out of the Twilight series, and has vampires speeding around on Segways.
I wonder how many people will be there. Probably not as many as there are for the normal stream
I can't say I've watched Twilight
Nothing can be that good; but I can't really comment on it until then
peabnuts: keep it that way.
Not even FiM is THAT GOOD.
I have at least 2 of the films on my Hard Drive
You should watch Vampires SUck
Maybe one day I'll see them

Hi
Hello JackiePie.
WHY MUST EVERYTHING ON LINUX BE CASE SENSITIVE
What's up?
Nothing much. Rather quiet here.
i'm half op? Okay.
LOLINUX
xD
linux is awesome lol
but
>case sensitive
mfw
Not alot of mods on atm peabnuts123. You will help right?
Sure, man
I get errors just because I forgot to capitalize an a or something
Thanks
I got nothing much to do
woo
ew....
There are more ponies in #EquestriaAfterDark
i know
oh crap
forgot to install openssl dev
oh and it's debian, need to install build-essentials too
:/
but debian is still awesome anyway
debian > ubuntu
How so?
ubuntu is bloated
has a ton of stuff that doesn't need to be installed
it's basically just debian with extra features that aren't needed
apokalipse
hi
take this
Hmmm
It really depends on what you need and how you define bloated
anyway bbl going to the library
bye
ooooh
I saw a previous version of that soundboard. This one has more stuff to click!
Trixie quotes... sweet
ubuntu is slow
and it's not ideal for servers imo
Hi
ohai
hi
More ponies are chatting in #EquestriaAfterDark

Recruiting
Oh hey. There's still people here.

12Espeon~
Well. I can ressurect it

Were you here for the movie night?
Wololo lolo
Yes.

12Floof~
Yes.
neat. I had to go after Alladin
06:3
Well. Ok, I skipped Dragonshy.
/me floofs
I needed to sleep
because that's kind of important
Sleep is for the weak.
Starship Troopers was great.
I'll see if I can catch it during the re-broadcast
Then people mentioned Robocop in the chat. So I watched that afterwards.
wat.
=b
Certainly wouldn't mind seeing it again.
yeah robocop is awesome
he's like a robot... and a cop... he's also bad ass
I got kind of mistyeyed over the stuff with his wife and all that.
12c:
I haven't actually watched robocop much
I kind of remember there being a TV show too. But don't remember if it was all that good or not.
03*WB02(Drake02)03WB* - <Lyon> 04I hate you all
no idea...
I bet as long as there is a robot that is a cop and is also bad ass it's good
wb Drake
I might go get some sleep, I didn't get much last night, and we danced for hours.
BBL
12Well, good night everyone
Maybe.
I'm pretty excited for next weeks movie
Seven
ohai
Yeah. It's pretty good.
Even though I've seen it plenty of times
I'd go for Fight Club myself over Seven though.
I gotta go now
cya brony
Forever a pone. :<
ohai K2a7s9m
You other guys still sleeping?
wb Drake as welll
04thanks
Drake
I dreamed that we got kidnapped by the Hensh last night ;_;
ohai Espeon
04...Another weird-ass dream?
I am so gonna draw mustaches on your faces
Wasn't that weird
but we did get kidnapped
04o-o
04Why?
06That is all
XD
lmao
04XD
6I see you.
6*stare*

Glad to see someone's alive.
6Only until I can sleep later.
yay
6Post-show went SO LATE.
people are aliveee
I thought the bugs got all of you.
6Nope.
6Killed them all.
6With my lag.
The only good lag is a dead lag.
Chat made up for the lag though.
That and the tank bugs.
6I still have no idea why it was lagging.
Time to replace the Packard Bell computer
6It's a Compaq...
6It's just... ew...
Time to get a chip in it that isn't crunchy.
6But it likes potato chips.
6As do I.
See? You give it junk food and eventually it will slow down.
6Nonsense.
6Just more carbs to keep it running.
Couldn't handle all the 1337 bugs.
6...I'm hungry now...
6THANKS
YOU
;D
So. Looking forward to the next B movie? ;P
6I haven't really looked into it.
Saw alittle of it on YT.
Brace for awful.
Not even sure I wanna watch it. :x
Me?
12hi floofy
But Seven will be a good time.
6I expect next week to be quite odd.
6...alright, I'm hungry.
6I'm going home and eating.
6Be back in a few hours.
See ya

Hi everypony
hihi
Hi Pearly
Gosh I need to come in here more often
D: this is pointless lol
I'll be going, seeya tonight i guess!
Man, I just keep sinking lower and lower. I just made some fanart for a MLP crossover fanfic omake I did for a SI story I'm writing. Sigh
well, author-art technically
>:
Ponies = instant happy :)
(Git your mind out of the gutter! Not like that ) :P
so...
well, off for fishing :3
BBL
I have to say, Twilight disappointed me in Feeling Pinkie Keen, she has a wrong approach to science.
As Cave Johnson said, science is not about "WHY?", but it's about "WHY NOT?"
/me hugs Drake
so she shouldn't have tried to know why Pinkie had those feelings, but why it was impossible
/me hugs back
04random o-o
Uhh
No I disagree
as a scientist I would prefer to know what was causing them
and what the results say about the situation
I can't prove anything to be impossible... well. very little.
you*
but there are too many variables, in a situation like that, i would act like the church did all those years
if you can't control it, destroy it
or at least say it's faulty
:3
If you can't control it, banish it to the moon for a thousand years
that worked for 2000 years, why would it work now?
well, what's changed?
find out what's changed, and banish that to the moon
Still
There aren't that many variables
Recent researches discovered that there's a portal stuck on the moon
You could pretty easily test for causality
pony rights activists? Moon. Pony rebeliion? Moon. Sister trying to make the world into eternal night? Moon.
so it's too risky to banish someone there
as there would be a way to run away
Yea, why didn't Luna just escape through Aperture Science
she tried, but Wheatly getting ejected through the portal klonked her on he head
ugh, darnit
I forgoti had thisplace upagain
Iwon'tleave you eqd chat!
Back laters, watching more FiM ^_^

It's Twixie.

Ghost_apples
It's based on Blogger so I imagine so
Hmm new around here

Everything gets posted to Twitter also if that's any help
No I want RSS for my rainmeter desktop

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf1rjj5lpLA
Well there should be Ghost_Apples

I will thanks
heh
I just ran into Twixie's synchtube on nightly update
You know what I don't get
Seth posts the Nightly Update every day
But... he actually posts at night time, for me
I live in New Zealand...
What time does he POST that?
Seth who?
aww
Sethisto, who runs Equestria Daily
Evening Coz
D'aww I stupidly thought Seth Green
Hey
how can u not know Seth
and hi Coz
I just lurk on this
oh
what's this
An abridged episode
oh my.
More importantly, is it a /good/ abridged episode?
Yet to see one
It's amazing
it's video
1
on here
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/06/friendship-is-witchcraft-lucky-number.html
Fluttershy without a deep voice.
That's one good thing.
lol
"We just watched Gremlins and an episode of Star Trek and went straight to bed!"
Princess Celestia is voiced by a guy
lolol
That was really good
Fortenheit 451
Lol
lolol
"Spike will build it."
Pinkie- check out har far I can slide!
how *
A lot of the voices don't really work.
They're good enough
It's all done by one girl, lol
excpet for
2 people
It is better than others I have seen.
That
Knights of Canterlot guy makes fricken hilarious clips
And he did an episode
But it was a different kind of humour
This was probably the best Abridged episode I've seen
I remember that.
It's the only one that actually made me laugh out loud.
Hahaha
I
LOVE
EV-ERY-THIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIN
G
*cough*
lolol
bawww
balls
HAHA; balls.
okay island is back up
holy shit
a phineas and ferb cover?
asiodguyhjaskld;
wtf i hate phineas and ferb
do not mention that show
Dude
That show is awesome.
What's bad about it?
regardless
The guys who did the cover
are amazing
http://www.youtube.com/user/Arraitchgee
it's that type of show that you can obviously tell when you should be laughing, but aren't
idk it just bothers me that much
Phineas and Ferb isn't a funny show really... it's just awesome
They make awesome stuff
it relies on the jokes and not the actual character developement
Alright. I've never seen.
seen it*
And they have ridiculously quality music
ok i admit their music is decent
/me likes Phineas & Ferb.
check it out
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwf86ndqsBs&feature=channel_video_title
but that platypus
lol
Perry
and that general who NEVER wears his pnts
i just don't get it
Lol
It's just lolrandom
yeah that's the word
too random
Not pinkie random
Ah well; I enjoy it
It's certainly shining out in the rest of television these days
/me points at the infinitely brighter light of ponies.
that much is true
the crap on TV now
So much
if i ever see another unoriginal drama/action tv show, i'll barf
Lolol
or another pointless and unfunny cartoon
I have to admit
THe tv on nowadays is; nothing on what we used to have
but if you're bored and it's just on
I can watch it
yeah TV has that effect
lol
isn't something you really even think about. you just... watch it
Ren and Stimpy, anyone?
yes
that and Dexter's Lab
oh my god i loved Dexter's Lab <3
It's been a couple of New Year's Eve's now we all just have Disney Channel or Nickelodeon on in the background
I only saw one episode of Dexter's Lab. It was hilarious.
Dexter's Lab was amazing
Nostalgia for my age
Totally
Wow
Did you see that Celestia cosplay on ED?
yeah i saw.
man she's beautiful
perfect for celestia
next up, Luna
That is amazing
*munch*
i just had an idea
im gonna paint my guitar light blue
and add RD's cutiemark on it
wooooo
I don't think it would matter who cosplayed Luna, I'd still break my monitor from hugging it.
Totally
Man
Do it
once i do it, i'm gonna go ahead and send it to Seth
Altair should be back soon
Did you ever see that picture of RBD with the Flying V guitar
yeah i saved it
it was my display pic for a while now
If only I had a V...
But they are impossible to play -_-
BUT IT'D BE WORTH IT
yeah the shape is for show off-y reasons
They'd be hard to sit in your lap, at least.
i'd rather play my SG
what guitar you own?
It's a cool shape but
I don't want to ALWAYS STAND UP while playing
Um
Okay; you know explorers?
or... X-plorer or W/E...
and you know how... fender have like a fake version with a similar shape..
yeah i know the explorer
Well I have a knock-off of the fake fender :p
well dayum
But I have a really nice acoustic guitar
fake fake fender explorer?
semi-acoustic
Yea lolol
and also a cheap acoustic guitar
lol almost the exact same here
My instrument collection is; erratic at best
Epiphone SG Special guitar, Semi Acoustic APX guitar, and a nylon guitar
I have an Ibanez electric
what type of Ibanez Muffin?
Nice, guys xD
My semi-acoustic is Ibanez
http://www.dv247.com/assets/products/38277_l.jpg <This one
both acoustics and semi acoustics i own is Yamaha loo
nice 8)
lol*
lol xD
MTM2 Mick Thompson Signature!
That looks similar to mine.
shiiiit that's sexy
dat head
i got it about 400 of on ebay!
I play Bass, too
400 off
But my bass is... not mine ... ?
It's technically my friend's
lawl
I also play bass
me too
but not really professionally.
learning guitar means knowing somewhat how to play the bass. the fretting hand at least
Totally
Does anyone have a seven-string guitar?
Pssh
i love my dad BC Rich Warlock http://www.guitarandampshop.co.uk/acatalog/BCRICHWARLOCKlarge.jpg
no, lol
nah
dads
but I played one in the shope
BC Rich guitars are good
but mostly for show
Egh those are nice but... I don't like metally shapes
A seventh string makes your guitar 20% cooler.
Not even
It's totally 16.6 percent cooler
lackluster
Yeah its overly metal!
I don't like them lol
I did not know this;
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twist_tie
even though I love metal
did not know what
http://profile.ultimate-guitar.com/profile_mojo_data/6/1/0/1/610178/pics/_c728831_image_0.jpg
my guitar
But they color code bread bags with the appropriate date the bread was baked
Oh
for example, if the bread was baked on monday, they'd use a blue twist tie
imagine that guitar light blue instead
with RD's cutie mark on
hell yes
this guitar is awesomez > http://www.espguitars.com/guitars/signature/esp-truckster.html
I know that; but in NZ they don't use twist-ties on bread...
ESP guitars are nice
Ah yeah, it's only in the usa that they do it. are you from nz peab?
Esp make SEXY AS FUCK Basses
Yeah i love them
yea
we have
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread_clip
bread clip wat?
oh they use those here sometimes as well
They are great projectiles
I love autotranscribe <3 http://i.imgur.com/7qpkk.png
anyways, dis guitar
http://i1.lelong.com.my/UserImages/Items/0908/22/trader1@11.jpg
lol
augh my eyes
so bright
Did you guys see that guy singing a couple Pony songs
without music?
yep.
nice voice
http://www.music-town.de/images/product_images/popup_images/40391_0.jpg
guitars*
I transcribed that and it was saying WEIRD stuff about seals.
s-seals?
yea.
Totally made sense as well
It was like
creepy
Does Equestria have a flag? Is there anything from the show or fanon?
Yea
They just had a flag competition like 2 days ago
Link please <3
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/06/equestria-flags-event-post.html
Thanke ^^
ten seconds flat.
i should learn some pony songs...
Hmmmm
None of them is really a simple flag
My Little Pony METAL!
Lol
I was figuring out Winter Wrap up
I swear
number 2 is the best imo
that is like
50 guitars
I'll love anyone who makes guitar tabs or whatever for MLP songs.
lol hard as hell right?
It's too complex
i make tabs :D
I managed to transcribe the beginning up until "Winter wrap up..." and was like WE'RE DONE HERE
There is a WHOLE WEBSITE for guitar tabs and sheet music
Everypony Sings
I'll just have to design my own flag for Equestria when the time comes
That's the one
http://www.everyponysings.com/
Oh ...
I've seen more too
Boy do I feel silly.
lolcats :p
Thank you.
make sure to comment on my tabs >:O
I figured out the lead guitar bits to CMC when they were doing that sing-along on Ponychan
yeah it's actually pretty hard
the opening solo at least
Eb, man?
Yeah.
you mean the tuning?
Why?
Eb is the tuning for CMC theme song.
i mean, half step down
how do you figure that
well i tried Bm chord for the song while tuned half step down
worked perfectly
so yeah
speakingof music, i should play the piano.
Hmm
you should. if my parents didn't force me to play piano, i wouldn't give two shits about music
i played for so many years and quit
I can't play piano
now i forgot holy crap
But I doodle on keyboard
Oh I used to play keyboard when I was much younger but forgot ALL of it
I can play a few things on keyboard
mostly pokemon music
i only remember the mortal kombat theme song on piano now
hahaha
and to think i could've played Fur Elise before
That's enough.
wow
like i said, i played for a long time
That must've beenweird having to be forced to play an instrument
well if you're asian, then no not really that weird
Lol xD
Asian parents HAVE to teach their kids musical instruments
i honestly don't know why
hmm
I learned all the instruments i know by myself
Same here
Well
yeah me too, except piano
drums, guitar, all that crap
But I played a lot of instruments when I was earlier
by myelf
I except trumpet and french horn. but i voluntarily joined band class in 6th grade.
lmfao yep
the point is, i can play so many instruments and i enjoy them all
I actually learned how to play drums because of Rock Band.
True story
Cool.
Same here, man
Rock Band was awesome.
I won a drum competition last year :B
hell yeah
i got 2nd D:
I bought my electric drum kit only a few weeks back
but then again, the guy was 10 years older than me
d'aw lol
oh nice whath kinda peab!
Would anyone believe me if I said Rock Band taught me how to play guitar?
that makes sense shaico
It's an awesome electric drum ki
t
SUPER fake lol
XM Drums
he was 25, i was 15
lolo
I did a drum competition when i was 12 and got 2nd lol.
It's taiwanese or something
iz good
I figured it would be good for learning on
and quiet
wow 12 and 2nd place in a competition is quite impressive
likewise for 15 lol.
I'd like to get an acoustic kit some day but a.) only getting there really and b.) quite impractical
It was guitar center's drumoff at any rate
for me, it was my school's drum off
oh wait
sorry it was just a drum competition
oh okay
i'm mixing it with my school's talent show, for which I got second place also
I was about to wonder what a 25 year old was doing participating in a school drum competition lol.
oh nice :B
damn that ventriloquist.
lolol
whoah
oh. I thought I said lolol for some reason
maybe i just said it in my head.
freaky.
I just play music in my room, lawl
oh yeah, btw check out my CMC theme song cover
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7grA1jnsLKQ
I don't have any friends close enough at a similar skill level
i do it in my music room
So I can't really jam
awh i know that feel pea!
i have lots of friends who know instruments
in fact i had a band once
And we were all bronies, which made it 20% cooler
oh that's brilliant
03*WB02(Ray02)03WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
I had a band with my friends in 9th grade with originals and such. we were a metal band lol.
I play the intro an octave higher than you
but that died after a few years, now i'm in a cover band with my dad
lol wow
Nice. I wish MY dad even cared about music lolo
aw :(
that's how my mom is.
Lol
lol
lol my MOM though was the one who forced me to learn
she loves music. just different tastes than mine
Classical music lover
I've been jotting around with a piece for Octavia recently
Been trying my best to write an almost classical piece on the guitar
with a classical guitar?
I don't have a classical ;_;
But my acoustic sounds good anyway
d'aw lol
ah okay good
lol
wait your acoustic semi string, or nylon?
I'm not sure a classical would sound that good with the idea anwyway
Both my acoustics are steel string :p
oh lol
i learned the guitar using nylon
then went on to semi
then electric
Learnt on my electric and then learnt acoustic on my crappy acoustic lol
The action is SO HIGH
but it was good to learn on though
Makes you a MAN
I recorded this super long crazy piao improv and called it 'this song is pinkie pie'
lol
awesome xD
my first nylon's action was higher than a hippie watching Grateful Dead
but nylon bends really easy
It's so nice
I had my friend's classical for a while, once
It was REALLY CRAP
But it sounded _amazing_
yeah nylons are great for that acoustic guitar solo.
e_e
the only song that I can name that has an acoustic guitar solo is....
uh
Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence
Part.. 7 or something
nice
ah man
I used to be obsessed with 6doit so much
solitary shell is the one you're talking bout <.<
You're talking about Solitary Shell.
Yea man
i know the keyboard parts to it lol
It uses a 12-string.
It's like
The best sounding guitar
i don't really listen to Dream Theatre much
EVER
not into prog metal
How much keyboard parts can you play, Pearly?
yeah it's pretty, i love the build up in that song into the end
of that song?
Of... like the "whole" song
pretty much everything of it with a half assed piano solo
fufufu can you play About To Crash
The intro bit
I <3 that
Hmm
I tried to learn it a few years ago, I have the sheet music to it lol
The intro to the reprise of About to Crash is bloody difficult.
funny how most of the music i listen to have easy ass guitar in it
I can play the guitar intro? Lol
like, drop D and going up and down the neck
Lol
Dropped tuning
yep
but it's still damn good
It sounds so metal
It's awesome lol
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17mD4reFUlw
It's a minor life goal of mine to cover Six Degrees/Octavarium one man band
drop D song
but so so so awesome
oh man yeah i just kinda went through the about to crash intro
I want to hear it when you're done, peabnuts.
Thanks
It's a few years off
lol
I'm not surprised.
speaking of octavarium, i just learned parts of the solo in like part 4 of it
I think one of the least metal Dropped D songs I know is Everlong
Everlong - Foo Fighters?
Yea
that's drop D? lol
the more you know
It's a curse.
Eh
that's how i was evolution
It's a learning process
I've been learning Rush's YYZ on Bass for like
3 years now
and I've only been played 3 years, lol
tbh i just picked up the guitar and start practicing dt crap the best i could. i'll get it eventually lmao
yeah i'm not even that good at guitar yet
It's legit
DT is the reason I got a seven-string.
You eventually get better at it
Yea
the hardest i can play right now is Bohemian Rhapsody solo
I wanted to play the intro to A Change of Seasons.
I am irked that I can't play HEAPS of their stuff
Glass Prison e_e
lolglassprison
Glass Prison is a good song
I know.
ee
It's one of my favourites.
Just the difficulty ...
Lol
i played glass prison on the drums the other day. it's so fun
Everything is that hard, man
Yep.
I want to learn riffs from songs like the beginning of Great Debate
But it's like NOPE seven string.
and even If I get a seven string; I want a decent amp to play it with
I'm going to learn them to spite you.
And that's like
So many moneys.
learn dance of eternity!
i can't keep up with this dream theatre talk D:
lolcats
oh gawd
lolwtf
I think I have a decent enough grasp of changing time signatures but please not Dance of Eternity.
I am ashamed I have not made it to that album yet
Aw
Like I said before
DT has like
9001 hours of muisc
music
Scenes From a Memory is one of their best.
It's one of their best imo. I learned dance of eternity on the drums a few years ago..it took FOREVER and ever
OH i know Dance of Eternity
that's the only song I know from DT
It's my favourite album actually.
i like beyond this life
fine
*puts it on*
My favourite song from it is probably Home.
none of this "okay; this is pretty cool.."
It's instantly bad ass
:D
i actually had that feel with octavarium..it was my first album from them i got
Who needs multiple listenings of songs when they can impress you the first time
and it was an okay this is pretty cool. whoah why did they not play 4\4 there.
Octavarium was the first DT song I EVER HEARD
And I listened to it like
oh snap
Lol
heaps
mine was the big medley
I'm ashamed to say Pull Me Under was the first song I heard of theirs.
On Guitar Hero ...
what time signature is going on here ;_;
d'aw
dat overture 1928
Probably my favourite song by DT
Well, fav is pretty... redundant
My currently most enjoyed is prolly something like
Lolol
War inside my head? or something
Actually I've had a hungering from These Walls lately
I love the synth on that
in the chorus?
Yea
ah yeah
or Great Debate
that was the first song where i was like
wtf time signatures
These Walls sounds ten times deeper than it actually is.
I've stopped listening to that all the time now though
TEAR DOWN THIS WALL.
A new song of theirs I've found is awesoem is
uh
*looks up spelling*
Erotomania
Erotomania is like erotica to my ears.
LOL
I guess that's the point e_e
lolol
Hah.
Can you really blame them?
I really want to see them live.
nopey dopey lol.
are there any lonely ladies out there
Hopefully they'll be coming to Australia sometime soon.
And Auckland, New Zealand is not exactly a well-frequented place for bands
I feel for you.
But I sort of; don't get excited over gigs for some reason
I mean
I enjoy them
and I imagine them being fun
But when they come around i'm always just like "meh"
like disturbed WAS on that list but they played here again recently
and I didn't go
Just because
And metallica even played
I have the hair for headbanging in a mosh, but I never do it.
But I kinda just, cbf
Hmmm
God Hoof.
I knew that long ago. :p
*out of the loop* ..portnoy...?
I didn't ;_;
Dragon kick your flank into milky way!
LOL
*buck
new, mike mangini!
no*
What happened to Portnoy lol
he left the band.
;_;
He wanted to take a break.
I KNOW I WAS SO SAD
No one agreed.
But I shit dicks evvery day listening to him
Well he deserves a break, man
yeah you're right.
Should I be ashamed for wanting them to pick Marco Minnemann just because the guy was wearing a Cookie Monster shirt?
He probably can't even eat his cereal in the morning without making it into a polyrhythm
I'm excited for the new album with mangini though
lmao pea
*can't spell rythm*
that made me giggle
rhyrhm
crap
rhythm
hah
You spelled rhythm right the first time.
It's funny because you know YOU do it.
o rly?
I am awesome.
So this Mike Mangini fellow
Who is he

LOLZER
Mike Patton is better

um...
?
Hello?
lol
Hey
Whatever happened with
not as bad as both ambernova and flame being down lol
Didn't Donati screw up in Dance of Eternity in the audition?
Avenged Sevenfold
02lol
Avenged Sevenfold dumped Mike.
Oh idk, Ididn't watch
Dumped whom?
I meant replacing um
The Rev
Something about the way he handled the publicity.
Mike played in the Rev's place but the band got rid of him afterwards.
He was replaced by some new guy.
Who; Portnoy?
Yeah.
i'm sure portnoy was just filling in for their tour
Damn, that would have been awesome
He said he was having fun with them.
Hehe
After they dumped him he tried getting back in DT.
By that time Mike Mangini had been hired already.
vaaht
where'd you hear the stuff from?
Wikipedia?
Mike Portnoy himself.
I almost feel like i've read it.
that sounds like crazy rumours
Hold on, I'll find a link.
okaky
ok*
Yea
It's on Wikipedia
I totally already read all of this
What is Metropolis Pt.2... Part 2 /of/?
8Hi
I'm trying to find the actual post on his forum.
Man
I want Score to be on Vinyl
Can you imagine how amazing (and many sides) that would be
MORETHAN 2
lol
I bought Black Album today
That is four sides on it's own.
And Metallica's S&M is 6 sides
hai guise
I'm woody
i do not like Metallica anymore
Howdy howdy howdy
Don't like their new stuff?
I need to get Death Magnetic on Vinyl..
no, you're peanuts
not at all
Howdy Howdy howdy
Gah, Portnoy must have removed the post from his site.
Death Magnetic seems like just a compilation of Metallica's riifs
they don't feel like songs
st angers sucks.
St Anger is /okay/ it's really dull though
just saiyin
I love Load/Reload
And Death Magnetic is good but
It's different
no doubt about it
but I'm totally put off by Death Magnetic's CD mastering
It sounds great on Record
hey
i like death magnetic for some reason
i've gotten really really bored of metallica
i've listened to them for too long
you certainly can
I am just back on them
In a casual kind of way
8Hi
Not listening to them hardcore
metallica's in my top 15 favourite artist/bands
But if they come on I fucking Jam
lol rly
top goes to daft punk
eh
I'm a tad bit early. lol
http://myfacewhen.com/thumbs/tn_36.jpg
8sorry, i'm dealing with like 5 different tabs right now, so it might take a while to respond
Daft Punk have like 5 good songs in my book
you're doing it wrong, Pearly
8better early than late, amirite?
no problem
Daft Punk is a decent House group.
you are very right
deadmau5 > Daft Punk
Daft Punk have
yeah i like house music
well i can't make a face here
SO MANY weird songs that you have never heard of and I don't like
u like dubstep?
yep
ehhh
i know most of them
Skrillex?
How many visitors does the re broadcast usually attract?
neal morse was decent though
skillrex's okay
How is everyone?
he's like the only dubstep artist i know lolo
good
rly?
I don't dig it
a bit sleepy
yep
about the only thing I can say I "like" is Originality
Thanks to a certain movie night
Dubstep goes against this
then im with you
However I will jam to it's Transformers samples
8well, this is our 1st week doing the encore presentation, so we dont really know
But it's all the same to me
oh, really?
if u like originality, check out Mr. Bungle
except for the part about dubstep
8could be a ton, could be only a few
holy crap they're awesome
Ah I didn't know
agreed
or, "eyup"
We're doing what movies? Yesterday's?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnLNXquIBVs
prolly my favourite band
yup
and by favourite band i really mean most respected
because I love so much music
Is Primus
cool. I get to catch Best Night Ever, and also Aladdin from the beginning
<3 Primus
actually tbh, i dont respect any band
Primus is meh
It's easy to hate primus
i don't see what the big deal is about Les
They play such weird music.
I missed those two because I went to Dairy Queen last night at around 7 PM
because they WILL have some shitty songs at somepoint of time
But Les' Bass lines make me jizz
I missed the B movie. Can't remember what it was lol
Mr. Bungle is much much weirder trust me
He's just... really good at bass
Star- something
So far it's about even with Primus
Primus is not about being weird
Primus ARE weird
But I just love Les' work
I just love it
in my pants
notacleverpony is number 9 on my list of top musicbros
Cheese.
number 1 for me is Eurobeat Brony
Seriously. He's talented
true
Will this kind of thing happen throughout the Summer, or all year?
2 is Saltakrits
eurobrony is number 10 for me
or however you spell his name
who's your number one?
daft punk
i mean brony musicicians
oh
8Starship Troopers is the movie
well hey hey hey about time Dashie is on
in tat case, it would be notacleverpony
8and the plan is to continue BMN for as long as we possibly can
awesome
ah
Good to hear
Haha
8once the fall rolls around and we get new MLP episodes, we will be live streaming them as well
oh my god
I want to show you a Primus song
But I cannot remember the name of it.
all his songs have the "i can play this FOREVER and not get tired of it" factor
There's not to many events that let us Bronies interact together
oh nice
Tommy the Cat?
That racecar driver song?
Nope
Those are both good songs
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flxy6ILzcx4
Just listen
to his bass tone
lol
And so we don't have any gender confusion, I'm a 22 year old male
me gusta
Gonna be 23 this October
and now I am listening to Primus
except the weird-ass cover art
"primus sucks"
isn't that their motto or something?
Though I can't wait for tomorrow
It's a bit of a catch phrase
lol
Coz; Brutal.
get to it
How come?
gonna need alot of red bull
okay how about
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5cOqCjInYI
diplo's pretty boss too
hows that for a bass line
e_e
oh
oh holy crap
when he played higher on the bass
that lil fil
fill*
wow
Ocarina of time was my favorite Legend of Zelda game, so I hope the 3D version is just as good
why primus isnt eligible for a VEVO, i will never know
Hopefully
Prolly 'cause
Oh wait they are together gain...
New album coming out *SO EXCITED*
I'll be afk for a couple of minutes
So yeah...
because some VEVO artists really suck
for some reason Primus reminds me so much of Butthole Surfers
Totally, man
But
Maybe with a bit more talent, lol
like the cataracs who always have that DEV kid feature in their songs
Primus is the guys in those costumes, yes?
lol definietely.
i dunnno lol
Dashie
you are referring to this
aren't you
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYDfwUJzYQg
Oh hey
Look
PrimusVEVO
cool
finnally
Exactly that son, Pea
I thought so :p
Im not a big fan of Primus tho
I am the only person I know who likes Primus and frankly, it's understandale

How did you learn that? I have a lot of problems with it, I guess I just need to learn how to do certain things
Until you sit down and fiddle with it like "okay, how the fuck does this work."

I now know why today was weird for me
No coffee

anyone click the link?
try the game
make a room
for example you can choose between having it fill automatically, but that blocks your view (hnnngh) but if you choose the other one, you have to fill it later which wont be vector then D:
and play
We should play club penguin/habbo hotel/second life
/me blames Wheatley and Nightmare Moon
Pony MMO. Saliva-worthy.
I just have it fill with 0% opacity on the layer, lool
wow those are amazing cupcake overlord
Thanx :D
Dats cool Cupcake :3

I don't want to play Booty Wars
lol
aww
I wonder how hard it would be to make a really simple online game...
Like what would be the most simple game that would be fun?
The Princess has Arrived!
Hi celestia
Out of nowhere, Princess Celest
Booty Wars
most simple game that would be fun
Plot Wars
justlike at the gala maeni
I mean
I could make a really simple Pony game lol
Don't worry im not evil or anything.....
hehe
Do eeet!
It'd be a good learn for netcode
Come on I'll make the room in Booty Wars
I've never dabbled
durrr :(
I closed it because it had a tutorial
e_e
well just skip it
There's a lot I want to do, but I dont because of laziness and because I'm not already good at them. Durrrr
it's pretty simple
It took too long
Booty Wars doesn't sound too fun anyway.
Lolol
Try it any evo
It kinda doesn't.
It has nothing to do with Booty
at all
Play it for the plot
Then i'm not interested
lololol
My brain was on derp mpode all day
*mode
it's pretty much turn based fighting on a pirate ship
Which booty are we talking about?
mine
:B
lots of lol to be ha
had*
Pearly's booty?
/me pokes
dead
I'm in.
What would be fun in the pony game?
...Bow before your Princess??
!espeon !isukra
Is itreally called booty wars?
/me bows.
It would need
ol yes
chat
Oh wow

Lolol

Yep

trolling unicorn and earth pony players by griefing from above.
i mean

/me BOW BEFORE BEFORE I KILL YOU ALL, thanks Evolution212
It's a bit late for me to play something anyway
I need to get going ~soonish
just one gaaaaaame
I'm not playing Booty Wars, loL!
Stop whining, Shaico!
Say
Overlord Celestia
I am NOT whining
You do vectors
this is whining here it comes.
Yes!
What kinda other art can you do
8what up silver
nah i'm kidding
im not gonna whine
....drawing?
on paper
Hrmm.. Do you use stroke or do you actually select all the lines individually and fill? :s
instead I'll drink this wine
Been busy this morning.
hey silver
derr
deerrrr
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Thiiiiiiis is wiiiiiiiiiiine!
here comes another chinese earthquake
i still learning photoshop! I selcet all the lines, i have not really tried strokes!
8silver: i know that feel bro
brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
I dunno Celestia; I just look for artists on IRC when I see them
In case I need to find somebody to do art for a game
8woke up, got on Brony State, have been doing BMN stuff ever since
Ah, I see.. Sounds better to me, but it just must take so long? D:
Stroke is
Disappointing
eeyup.
Its take about half an hour when i do it...
It doesn't let you have sharp points
And everything is the same width
Unless you use similate pen pressure
simulate*
Yea but...
yeah to match the still of width of the show
How do with Stroke... e_e
Huh.
;o
im gonna give stroke a try
I made THIS with Pen tool and stroke
http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v41/peabnuts123/Twilight_Running.gif
It took me like
A thousand hours
Ouch
It looks mighty nice, Pea
Appreciate the work you put into this
Looks neat tho :D
aw no way peab
that's cute
I put too much time in it, for what it is
Peabnuts123: image moved or deleted :(
Pea
8it's my pleasure
moved or deleted...?
D'aww, she's running away from her fears.
But it's a very clean animation :3
i would love to be able to animate them... but i suck!
8it is a huge time sink, but i love
It's just placeholder art lol
no she's running at the hyrda1
8it
!*
or nmm
Oh right
I didn't tell you
It's traced from Dog and Pony show
When they are running
Been bustin' my flank for The Daily /oat/
oh
Lolol
I'm not talented enough to draw properly =D
Hmm
First thread will be up today @ 5PM EST
http://i.imgur.com/jJMLJ.png
Me neither
thats the best i can do
oh man
I can draw ponies - in a standing upright position
I have a pic of rbd i drew hold on lol
I wish I knew more about coloring..
And I can draw them pretty well; but THAT'S IT
i suck at drawing
really suck
I think I would like to try a tablet
Who has tried to draw themselves as a pony?
And then, one last nickchange.
I feel my drawing skills would improve vastly
!todo list
Yesssss.
the thing that bothers me is the head shape
i can't draw head shapes at ALL
http://img9.imageshack.us/img9/8977/rbdyo.png
Their head shape is a circle...
What
I just used the pony generator, Evo
there's my rbd, i forgot to put wings on her
aww ^_^
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/a1304a753ddbbf49a3a1fa91cc5a9afb/15727%20-%20Fallout%20fallout_equestria%20Littlepip%20original_character%20Velvet_Remedy.jpg I spent gosh knows how long on this too, I just feel I have huge trouble selecting the right colors
http://i.imgur.com/jJMLJ.png is the best i can do, but that's derpy
I found out about the pony generator afterwards.
i can't draw circles
Maeni
That's awesome
Not to mention how i messed up Lilpip
I still try to draw ponies though.
thanks :3
I spent time looking at a still picture of them
and copying it down
and just memorising all their details
i want to learn how to draw pony
Hm ...
so i can draw porny
and nopony thinks my derpy is any good\
:(
not even a comment
not a sausage
I totally commented on it
Is Fallout Equestria a really good story?
I- i ..!
Oh
I forgot to relate my comment
Peabnuts123: you..commented on my pic? whatd you think?
I said I could draw them standing
But forgot to say
It's just the shapes in the body that are off~
Your posing was > mine
yeah i dont like strokes... just tried it
Peabnuts123: yours didnt load for me :(
my animation was just a trace from the show :p
Evolution212: fallout equestria's got 6 stars, but ymmv. i dont know though, im a pre-reader but I didnt read it
It didn't require any artistic skill
and
i'll brb, going out to eat with the rents
It is a really good story
like, really.
While not very Pony, I think the style on derpy's head is cool
It's old timey
like old Disney
Alright, thanks. I was a bit apprehensive because it was a crossover.
I'll go read it.
Peabnuts123: its...not very pony? :(
Yah, the muzzle looks more realistic than in MLP actually, in MLP they're very flash-animation-styled
Peabnuts123: hmm, muzzles ARE difficult though.
It's not very Lauren Faust pony
but so waht?
yeah, its kind of halfway between male and female, isnt it?
midnight, I'd say if you resize the wing, make her chest less large and fix the muzzle (if you want her to look more MLP-like and not horse-like), then it's mighty fine :3
And of course, work on coloring, those damn colors *angerfist*
http://i.imgur.com/kphvm.png is what id id yesterday
ugh, yeah, i SUCK at colouring
lolcats
What a twist
thats much better!
Wth that is indeed
Hahaha, Eee-nope.
yesterdays pic is better?
Eeyup.
ultimately
maybe my colouring ruined it
It's super gay but
drawing is just for fun
oi!
Hahaha
your pic needed some more shading midnight
(not your drawing)
drawing is just for fun and you should just draw no matter what your drawings come out like
yeah, caramels not allowed to help build bigmacs house of cards
FINN
The human
!!!
AWESOME!
thats...pretty good!
=D
Twilight looks like she's deathly tired
:|
She's not impressed
i no
like really exhausted
twi looks like twi, and yeah shes exhausted
look at them bags
XD
i fudged up the eyes
goddamn how do you get lines that DONT SUCK ASS
PEN TOOL
Everywhere
practices
fuck me but i just cant get lines like that
srsly pen tool everwhere.
All over your face
i have gimp
(and twilight's)
Pen tool is a god damn prick, but he has skills
all over your face, in your hair, on your back
Befriend pen tool, and you will have those skills
You just have to befriend pen tool
does it smooth out jitters of the strokes?
You don't draw with it
You click point
vertices
:O
and it interpolates between them
That's your FIRST ATTEMPT, Celest? ...
ohhhhhhhh
yep
well fuck me again
go away ;_;
i'll see if I can get the handle on that
...
you're too good :(
It's REALLY WEIRD
Holy crap Celestia
But you get used to it
DAYUM you're good
i just get the hang of stuff easily
and you learn how it fits together
That looks exactly like the show
http://i.imgur.com/dsalw.png first pony
perfect
have i got better?
Erm... YEP!
Your first pony is way better than mine, lawl
Lol
midnight, you need to add some color to the eyes
Celestia
20% better
otherwise, really really good
I'm admiring Scoot when I notice her eyes
i no
Shaico: tell me about it. i suck at colour
That is good indeed. Have you tried following those guidelines that are around?
http://i.imgur.com/aSlgK.png i want to see THIS pose done properly
I could fix it but... i cant be bothered
I'm reading the intro to Fallout: Equestria. It sounds epic but I know if I read it before watching MLP it would sound cheesy.
Wow, wat
sword pony?
>before watching MLP
wat?
Yea, it's good enough
It was a dark period of my life, Maeni.
that pony-with-sword sketch was done in about ten seconds flat, so..hehe
D;
awww, fillyshy
aww
you're just crushing my hopes and dreams now
You nailed her tail
dawwwww
because i am SO not that good\
Sooo..
Well we haven't left yet
sorry midnight shadow... you can get betters
Just draw for the fun of it
But i'm picking up a job application at some pizza place
the yellow line that forms her plot, when it hits her hair, I can spot some eraser tool ;]
Anyways~
Evo, what was that supposed to mean? D:
what's a plot?
Huzzah, all.
You mean 'before watching MLP'.
Aye
Better than mine.
Plot
And the part about a dark part of your lfie
But I got better.
lol celestia. the squigglies under her make her look like
a rocking horse
plot = I watch it for the "plot"
That meant the time before I watched My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic and became a brony.
oh that plot
does that make anyone feel better...?
That's like my first pony except
Oh :(
I only did the guide circles because of the drawing guides
my first pony was that rbdyo.png lol.
yeah i do the circles
I read up lots of them before even trying
They helped a lot
Well FOE isn't cheesy xD Except maybe at the very start, when you're like "durrr, MLP + fallout, no way"
Evil_Overlord_Celestia: actually yeah, thats making me feel better
I don't do the guide circles, lol.
I love Fallout as well, so I think it's easy to adjust.
And the intro was perfect.
:D
I read it in Ron Perlman's voice.
Damn you, vectors.
wow not bad celestia
Vectors!
Vectooooooors!!!
I havve to pay my cousin for vectors.
VECTOR SIGMA!
I drew a Luna for today's training ground. it's terrible xP
but yeah my newer stuff is 20% better!
i do vectors for free i took a few requests recently
Primarily because I don't own anything beyond MS Paint.
http://img850.imageshack.us/img850/4290/abandonedponies.jpg these two were some of my first few ponies I drew
This makes me sad.
All vectoring is is just cropping out a pony right? but to like, the finest degree
Aka before I saw all those shape guides
So, hello people.
Cute :3
Bonjour!
Hello.
Vectoring is drawing with vector-based shapes
wow that one is really nice evil overlord
Hekki Flamester
Rev
hey flame
hay?
What's a vector based shape?
That's adorable.
try wikipedia if you want to no http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics
A shape that isn't made out of pixels, so you can keep making it larger and it will always be just as detailed
nice. What program do you use?
oh wow
that's neat
Vectors are made out of pure
liquid
MATHEMATICS
Looks like Illustrator.
Ah
I have been using photoshop... not exactly a vector
interesting
okay, tell a lie. THIS is my first pony.
http://i.imgur.com/c9SVP.jpg
Lol maeni you made me giggle
:D
Vectors are made out of pure liquid mathematics
oh....
Mission accomplished
oh, nice.
you almost made me bust out laughing near my dad and i had to change it to a cough
midnight
I still like your faces
They are cool
But really, you should use Illustrator for vectors.
Well true, Celestia, photoshop isn't very vector-like :/ but it does have pen tool so at least it has some
I dont know why people use photoshop for them.
i cant get used to illustrator... the tools dont work right...
Peabnuts123: thanks. you're buttering me up though. im not that good.
how can I see your cAms>
Sadness
Hello again.
Photoshop works for everything
can only see mind
I tried using inkscape
also i would then need to but Illustrator!
No really, I like your faces
buy
but it's just so much easier to use gimp
They are different
I learned it in my advertising and design class
It's easy enough to copy someone's style
I draw ponies, but they turn out like this.
Just yesterday, I discovered content aware scaling and "puppet warp"... Lolz were had
I havent drawn a pony.
Don't you mean "busting your haunch"?
yet.
I pony pony pony
I just photo'd my pony drawings
anyone? helpme?
ponyyyyyyyyyy ponyy.
How am I even supposed to vector that?
.. Hey, I actually like that style
/me hugs Evil_Overlord_Celestia
I like your style Revolver!
I spent time getting them right
http://i53.tinypic.com/317clxe.png
Yay.
Simon.. ?
private me if you know how to work this
Thanks Rust!
oh, thats easy
The flank is closer to the leg than the haunch is.
and I had mucho reference material
http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v41/peabnuts123/ponyPictures.png
I can vector that.
My attempt at luna its bad xP
yay pony
but the haunch is closer to the rear
CHAT TOO FAST

8eh, either way
:B

Whoops.

Night

i like bg horse cock
OH MY GOD THAT WOULD BE AMAZING.
Just saying

Scootaloo doesn't fly
Someone once said that multiple exclamation marks is a sure sign of an insane mind.

Scoot can drive her scooter with her wings

*Laughs Crazily*
Oshit
We certainly aren't RPing
:3
*teleports*
This started out as I think is a stupid guy who won;t teven take a revive.
^ Y U CALL PEOPLE STUPID?
It's only becase you...
I think only reason it's not working it because Scoot wants to be dead...
-killed- Scootaloo
U GOT WARNING FOR THAT!
http://i358.photobucket.com/albums/oo30/JPVG77/Impossibru.png
IMPOSSIBRU!
playing portal 2 for the 2nd time
I totally changed my nickname
gah
woohooooo
No one can be dead forever...
Lolol
And 15 mins is what's left of reversible death..
We need a quote bank for this channel
He is the SPICEPONY.
??
HE CONTROLS THE SPICE.
ohai LU
Ok...
HE CONTROLS THE UNIVERSE
Look, if it's not working then it means that Scoot wants to stay dead.
*referancde
if she doesn't, then she should be alive...
*DAMNIT, REFERANCE
Otherwise, I'm gonna have to break the 4th wall to make it work..
Scoot is dead and it's all RBD fault
Why is it MY fault?
What IS GOING ON HERE!
SHE'S THE ONE WHO- ohshit.
MURDER IN EQUESTRIA!
STOP RIGHT THERE CRIMINAL SCUM
H--H--HOw could you?
Such as peab's action behind scoot, I'm gonna have to stop that...
IDIN'TDOANYTHINGITWASN'TMEHOWCOULDIOHSHIT.
Celestia, please listen...
ohai SS
I see EVERYTHING!
Please.
Okay...
i will be able to turn into your show this evening
Oh you are SO getting moon'd
CELESTIA< WHY WON'T YOU LIIISTEEEN?
*sigh*
As I was saying
Hey guys what's next weeks B movie again?
RD here had no intention of killing Scoot.
my grandma's pc did read the file well
*teleports*
on Windows Media Player >.>
*teleports back with popcorn*
If she does have that why do ti in front of everyone?
It's still fillyslaughter
8Spider's Web: A Pig's Tale
It's illogical.
Celestia, stop.
HMMF
*teleports*
No banishing, until we have discussed.
*teleports back*
If she wasn't guilty then why does she keep teleporting??
Oh. Yeah I remember it being something I've never heard of
Banishing without any notion in your head...
/me plays with Light's tail
Reidculous
It's basically a ripoff of Charlotte's web.
ANyway
Because you aren't fair and might banish me anyways?
Look.
Put your hoof up if i should baish her?!
You're the ruler.
This isn't a trial
ohshit
Celestia has ultimate power
*raises hoof*
Poor scootaloo.
8a really, really bad, low budget rip off
I disagree.
And since this is a biarchy, this is kind of normla for people to be afraid of you..
/me watches :3
No It was Rainbow Dash
No.
we're in for some fun then
No It wasn't me.
I saw her do it
I'm saying HE has the ultimate power.
In this case.
no
he
does
not
Yess.
He.
And as such then, th?e sun is tired, right
Does.
Nope

Nope.
Fact of the matter is
banishment
We have a body on our hands
*teleports*
and somebody is going down for it
*teleports*
Alright someoen is gonna get banished!
Why not Celestia?
And..
Apokalpse: 'CAUSE I'M BUSY AS HELL!!!
*moment of truth*
SHE is supposed to PROTECT ponies from mares like me.
There are some low budget movies I like, so I may come back after Se7en to check it out
Did it work?
Rainbow Dash i know about your 'fillyfoolery' i have pix!
If PEABLES is correct, then no!
so you should get banished
Banishing me would put a word on YOU!
as a fair and decent ruler.
As a FAILURE to your OWN job!
Really? *sarcastic* OH NOES!
lol
She is UPHOLDING the law!
Lolyeah.
BRB, Dinner
Upholding?
06http://wildcritters.ws/data/6298ea80ed1adbf8941d13c7095bff12.jpg?1308408065 what
Pfft.
We have a death, do you not agree banishment is a fair punishment?
Wait.
I didn't see her PREVENT the death.
lol hai murasaki!
As her duty goes as GOD!
8its a horrible, godawful movie with no cinematic value whatsoever
Im not a freaking Superhero!
Right.
Im a flipping Princess
You are GOD.
8basically, we're showing it because the chat is going to be fun
Only GOD.
Hey
Well.... erm Yo MOMMA's GOd!
Omg, I just had this incredibly far out dream that I need to tell you guys
I didn't see YOU try and save here, Rainbow Dash
Guys
God is SUPPOSED to do that sort of thing.
You were with here at the time!
...
GUYS
Look.
Sup?
In my dream I got to see a sneak preview of the next season of FiM
I now appoint LUna as onourary God!
Biarchy, people tends to be afraid of kings and queens
Ok?
And the episode was about rainbow dash and her real origins
And that's normal here...
Uh huh *listening to Avian*
Then, you can't banish me, right?
and sometimes you get ssick of that right Cel?
Only God can do that.
The Sun is tired, right?
I know that this is most likely not going to be 100% real but it seemed real to me
ocrapI'mnotgonnareadthatfic.
And so, If Celestia's the ruler and powerful here...
*sigh*
Basically in teh episode you find out that rainbow dash was actually adopted and lived in a far of village from couldsdale and ponyville
thats IT, I QUIT. I AM RETIRING!
with Apple Bloom!
She can't have sole decision..
You also found out that Rainbow Dash is only really half Pegasis
TWILIGHT CAN BE PRINCESS NOW!
Celestia is banishing HERSELF!
since it's a biarchy
Really?
Cool.
lol wut
I get the palace.
So uh
Who changes nick to Princess_Twilight first.
ah
Peab, pausing Scoot's revival is menaningless now..

I'm going to freak out though if it turns out my dream is right however
And yay.
Heard of it, but thought the box looked like crap to be honest.
ohshit.
Scoot isn't dead...
Why is everypony dead?
Rainbow Dash killed Scootaloo.
I'm dead because of Porky.
I DID NOT.
Wait
Since when was Apple Bloom dead
Um, noneof us are dead now...
Hm.
Hey Eccy Weccy
Applebloom would've made a great minion if she were alive, a shame. I could've used her to help rebuild Everfree Castle.
Honest, I don't think it was RD's fault...
(The top one is what Reconstructed Apple Bloom looks like.)
Not all of it...
I woldn't a helped YOU.

LATERS
Bye Peabnuts
I don't care.
Ah wouldn'ta left mah sister.
Fer nothin'.
Well, I suppose I could always just ponynap you. Fulfill some nonsensical evil villian quota or something.
Ah guess.
Nightmar MOON!
Too late now.
/me le gasp
And scootaboot, I got to go...
Oh, you're still here? I suppose being an internet entity would enable you to do that.
Gasp le
What is it Derpy? Don't you have some kind of wild goose chase of a delivery to be doing?
REV.
YOU HERE?
Speakin' a 'evil villan quotas' mind helpin me fill mine so Ah can go be one o' the good guys?

Hmm, you hardly seem family material. I suppose you can't blame sister for being sympathetic with you.
(RAGE()
Yep i killed her Nightmare, it was so FUNNNN!
Ya WHAT?
And Applebloom, you're undead now, you'll never get your cutie mark.
Killed the Princess silly
Well that's not very nice, Derpy.
sorry...
Whatever.
Um, walk downstairs.
Well, it was low budget
Please.
she was goona kill Dash Rainbow!
But like Ah said, are y'all gonna help me fufill that 'evil villan quota' thing?
if applebloom was undead, couldn't she have the black lantern sybbol as a cutiemark?
Ah dunno.
lol, Spider's Web doesn't even have a movie poster.
Well, Derpy, it is much more of a punishment to have somepony locked away in an eternal prison. Like the moon.
Ah can't take this darned coat off ta look.
8nope
8like i said, really low budget
I buried the princess in MUFFINS!
Alive...
(The top one.)
Y'all what now?
Would random acts of violance count as evil, y'all?
yes
Oh, well. I'm always free for helping the undead fill their evil quotas.
DOWNSTAIRS
Now
Well, as this one hero said before I struck him down... "In the name of meaningless battle!"
*Stabs Derpy*
Im Imortal Silly!

Consarnit.

Well then, Spider's Web is a parody. Nothing more, nothing less
*telesports back*
*Shoves Dinky to the moon*
/me rescues dinky
*Stabs Dinky*
And if done right, parodies can be excellent movies all their own
Does this happen all the time, here? ...
AH think.
Dinky is also imortal
silly
....
she is my daughter
part hellspawn too
and the heir to the throne
8no, its pretty much a straight rip off
satan is my father lol
stabes apple bloom*
then it's a Knockbuster
Ah'm already dead.
no twilg--- i mean erm your farther is not satan...
8yeah, more or less
A Mockbuster can be termed as a parody. a Knockbuster is a simple rip off
im curios, what caused this onslaught of bronies?
i dunno i just got here
Which onslaught?
Great, ya got yer kinfe's blood stains all over mah gosh-darn coat!
Sorry applebloom
Movies like Spaceballs and Young Frankenstein are parodies.
Y'all better be sorry.
This looks....ugh.
I can't even watch the trailer for it.
I haven't seen it for myself, but by your dislike, they didn't put much effort into it
*wiping coat*
Oh qit your whining, the blood will fleck off in a few days
Derpy and Appleblooms
I can't even take it off ta wash it.
Maybe they could have made it into a parody with more effore
Oh i forgot to tell applejack is dead
effort*
8it was made so that people would confuse it with charlottes web and accidentally buy it, pretty much
tell you*
That's how they work, like Transmorphers, and Land That Time Forgot
You killed the element of Honesty? I don't believe you, nothing can kill the element of Honesty, she's practically a mortal goddess!
[[ Bitch be strong yo ]]
I killed your sister and she is an imortal goddess
Both of which I was smart enough to avoid.
Celestia's on the sun, she'll be back in a few days.
No shes dead
seriously...
hi

GRR, YOU KILLED APPLEJACK AND MADE MY INTERNETS DIE!
8pretty sure that the narrator is heavily sedated during this trailer
She didn't need to because Celestia did.
XD
Nightmare Moon... she is dead!
Probably had to be to get him to stay there.
yer dead
You need to stop living in the past
yer all dead
and get over it
I TAKE OVER.
MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Princess_Derpy, I had my sister on the verge of death and she still managed to banish me to the moon. You can't kill Celestia.
we are all just floating in the infinite cosmos called the planets of etheral and its made of darkness. but what you dont know is that its good for you because they are good.
...
I am the Element of MUFFINS, i killed her!
8it seriously sounds like kidnapped and drugged a college student
I'm going to engage an EPIC BATTLE with Derpy for the throne now.
Wait, it still looks like Derpy has managed to at least be rid of Celestia.
You kill her, and the entire natural order crumbles, falls apart, all of ponydom and the universe itself will cease to exist. It's what happenes when a god dies.
8with 0 narrating ability
That's a lot more than whatever you've accomplished, NM.
She did die, though, Nightmare Moon.
Yeeeaaaahhh, it's stupid
And then i took over your position.
when god dies. thats going to be my new novel im working on.
its going to be 10000 pages
I am god now!

13Okay. Just training the Valor Form (not a single Anti yet...)
On endoscopy and colonoscopy, he has patchy inflamed areas in the terminal ileum. Biopsy shows noncaseating granulomas.
Shoot him with a shotgun. Fixed.
What's the point of this again?
Diagnosing patients is fun?
:l
And treating!
Treatment is good too.
Well, I haven't read up on anatomy in FOREVER, and, uh....
*scratches head while alking away*
Anyway, what does he have? Can't treat without a diagnosis!
Well, you can, but you're begging for a malpractice suit.
13Yes! Sora leveled up (Level 66)
LOL
xD
*munch*
Heh, I just killed Dedede by telling everyone Rainbow Dash likes Braeburn.
*Punches Twilight*
RAINBOW PONY IS PRETTIEST PONY
Breaburn is okay.
Ow.
RAINBOW DASH ALWAYS DRESSES IN STYLE.

CELESTIA, WHY DID YOU NOT DELETE GENERATIONS ONE THROUGH THREE FROM EXISTANCE?
Stop being whiney, Rainbow Dash.
Anyway, back to bloody diarrhea! What are you going to do for this poor pegasus?
i just wanted to get a freakin' drink

4Got all those 50 done
I mostly frequent in #mylittlepony on irchigway

Oh yes

Shipping is a no no and fics are allowed to be discussed only if they've been approved first.
13Okay!
But other than that quite nice folks ^^
So I was in JCPenney today.
and no scootaspam... though, let's leave that tale for another day.
And I just thought...
"If this store starts selling brony tees, my head will explode. Twice."
Does JCPenney sell themed Ts?
But wouldn't that make your heart stop for a second or so?
They have Angry Bird tees.
Among others.
Ah, k
CAN THEY DO THAT
They should
CAN THEY EXPLODE TWICE??
Oh
Lol

When the internet makes things happen in real life- that's epic

Is the reason that Scootaloo can't fly related to the whole chicken thing?
i love the moodof it
4both leveled up all the way
hello
you really got the scariness down
:D
XD it's the chord selection.
and the natural vibrato of strings
Yez
Timeto draw twilight sparkle
but basically I chose chords that can't possibly be in the same key musically, which gives it that eerie fear to chromaticism
Ooh, i see. even better than.
13Anti Form's terrible if it involves defence. I'm not Paul from the Pokemon anime, y'know
/end music rant
that reminds me of a crazy piano improv i did and called it 'this song is pinkie pie'

It was forever ago.
