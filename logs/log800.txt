Eh
I didnt really like DS if anything

Applejack has gone full apple...
I feel kinda pathetic I never joined a guild or did a raid till I was lvl 80
I still havent cleared a Cata raid besides DS and most of FL

also the faction community depends on servers
My guild is full of nice people
in some it's the Horde that are nice
in others it's Alliance

WHY?!
how are things Linderman
WHY RUIN A COOL CHARACTER
hi again guys :)
A waffle
Yes, a few hours ago that was me
Well, okay, he was acceptable in SA2.
Damn. Not here
oops
i'm good Linderman
damn distracting ponies
I has work to do!
They left his real fate ambiguous
you already said that
today
And they left his characteristics uninteresting.
There I'll agree with you.
I really like Blaze as a character though
HE SUCKS
Now at least he can act being intolerable.
Look. Its Sumida! The evil version.
Oh jesus..whine whine
He makes you watch streams on dail up.
D=
Ghehehehehe.
The series would've been rather pointless without him. :P
the more the merrier
The more the m- *SHOT*
Yes, he had his awful moments too :P
But Colours was genius.

13hm
i dont even
I do
i was only in bronymusic once that one time with the whole war thing
:D I lol at other pony's non-understanding :D
whats bronymusic? a channel here?
13a channel harboring trolls
0,5Do et
do it then
hehe
13that's why i'm asking, anyone who's in #bronymusic would be effectively banned here
yeah bad idea I think
hey guys
13at least wouldn't be able to speak and wouldn't be able to rejoin after leaving
That's a bit mean :/
0,5Shizuka is the Jarl of another hold
just sayin
when was this incident?
13otakon: am
good :)
havent heard about it
If thats possible
13so far we've had at least three trolls blunder in from there
0,5BlazeAngel Nu
13and a rumor that bronymusic wants to start shit with us
Wouldent it be unfair to the innocent victims?
^
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tt4-HU2FhQ
I'm just saying that banning a whole community would be mean.
bronymusic?
me
a channel
another channel, Socks
Crush 40 always does good music
Socks: Channel.
harboring trolls
0,5Yeah screw 'em
:O
i can see some trolls, impersonators, etc
I still say its being mean to the innocents
^
0,5VIVE LE REVELECIEN
I dont think every single one of them deserves to be banned
Socks: Pretty much.
Ok :)
And then channel wars
13http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/rfc/rfc.html
By JINGO!
Arent we being a little extreme here?
13in any event, trying to start conflicts with other channels is against network rules
/me starwars theme plays
I'm pretty sure that not all of the people in bronymusic should be banned from coming here. That's kind of like banning people here that don't talk and only lurk.
I'm okay
I have a bunker
... "with tonberries"
AND MY SHIELD!
AND MY AXE
I feel like a little child first realising that there are different countries
an entire army of the fuckers
yikes
um
13again, trying to start fights with other channels is against network rules, this would be nipping it in the bud
should we go tell them?
if they can't handle their own users, then they shall be punished...
I mean should someone go tell them what's going on?
ahh is it just me or is it getting a little...morbid in here/
*?
/me grabs his spoon "I shall need this if we're going into battle!" :P

Socks: You have IRC sickness.
Socks: I'm sorry, you're going to die.
