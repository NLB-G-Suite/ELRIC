Cheese + Fries
Buytoast, I know I won't get away with saying this, but please. That enough.
Oh, and some kind of sauce

Polydunami: Actually, it's Fries plus Cheese Curds plus Gravy.
Yeah, I just looked it up
that sounds amazing!
It's a good combination
just give kim jun un enough time and he'll bomb china
n korea is the real nuke power
This is hilarious from a Canadian point of view
I'm calling it now, we're gonna end up blowing everyone up oen of these days
Canadian Apple Nuke
Or boring
Give North Korea time. The Kim Family will somehow historically have invented nuclear power.

Oh my
VenHur: ikr
I recognise that set anywhere
This is incredibly unfitting
mr rogers
Lol
Mr. Rogers...
Polydunami, I wholeheartedly agree.
By the way, this forced me away from Space Pirates and Zombies.
SuperBrony64: lol
When I was a kid-- older kid than intended, pre cable, I saw this llisted in the TV listings as Mistrogers.
05just got back with tea
05adn turend on the news

Well, the Canada video did, anyway.
05cause its 7am

When we finally got a antenna that picked up public TV, I was so damn dissapointed to find it wasn't a SF show like the title looked like.
Wrek: hi
Wrek: Huzzah! Wrek is finally getting his driver license!
Wrek: Normal Day? :P
Wrek: ...Now don't screw up at Boating School...
VenHur: Ah, I see what you did there. :D
Tomorrow's low is 34. 100% chance of rain here.
08,01okay, i'm going to crowdsource opinion on this
08,01does this sound good or bad: "Playing Programmer - Teaching Computational Thinking Through Logic Games"
05-18 as in outside temperature
08,01it's the title of a tlak i'm writing
08,01*talk
Wrek: [facepalm] Ohhh...
Sounds like a good title to me.
^
...But it DOES sounds good to me...
05remind me to bring my own food next time i visit manchester
05i couldnt stand the stuff they served at the hostel
05was starvign most of the day
Romney, go home...you drunk
dose scootaloo have a sister i heard it's cheerli
NocturnalBlade, that's no more the real Mitt Romney than the outsourcing monster that the MSM painted him as.
djxana: Nope, but Sweetie's sister was Cheerilee in G3.
08,01cheers y'all
Cheers...
05:C
Inb4 he does...
THey really like apples.
This is easy humour
dafuck Wrek
05its 7am and i havent slept
05random humor is a go
Wrek: Go home you're drunk
Dat Applejuice
Wrek: Go drunk, you're home.
well that done happened 6_9
VenHur, I can't imagine someone enjoying this without being drunk or worse.
it seams like the same jokes as i find in adult swims live action programs
05ok wtf is this shit
Now you're getting close
Even Wrek questions this
Wrek: It's madness...
Oh, all of a sudden, the guy's screaming made me laugh.
Lol Thursday's forcast was nuke
daaaaaaw <3
Daaaaaww...
aww
Alright. That's cool
Welp, I must go now...

See you, VenHur
05your people needs you VenHur?
i for some reason cant understand the djo jokes is there something i'm missing
bye VenHur
Wrek: Yes, my tacos needs me...They need me to glues the canyon back together...
No, you've got the right idea, djxana
djxana, according to TV Tropes, it's supposed to be nonsensical.
djxana: I don't think so... I think I just figured it out. This isn't really very funny. It's just pointlessly random.
05the V in view
Wrek: ...Yeah...that one canyon...the one with a million of old ET cartridges...Welp, I must go now.
05represents their vagina
05OR
05the pose they sit in
At least... I'm not laughing. I'm gone for now.
/me waves
See you, Kencolt
lol
it's more tollerable than childrens hospital or ntsf sd suv
dat carousel music from Super Mario 64
bye ken
And now for something completely different
Is there a way to send notes to users who are gone?
cocaine
Kandarihu, yes. As long as they're still on the network
We doin' requests?
Spy, calm down.
These guys should not be making those faces
AssaultWithEmbraces, I meant a note system, where I leave a note for someone who left the network that they will see when they come back.
COCAINUM
Kandarihu: I don't think so
Cocainium? What the hell?
We ARE doing requests, right?
Roboda?
dat Goron music ^_^
Damn.
Seems unlikely
05yeah i rarely take requests
Poor Heavy.
XD
ScoutNavi
aaaand that was loud XD
You know what? It doesn't matter. I wanted to tell Kencolt that Wrek got off of the Dayjob Orchestra and onto Source videos right after he left. But it was the RED Team doing Cocaine.
Now that was kind of not there
Noisy TESTICLES?!!
^
That beginning Shh reminded me of the Gracie Films logo
Yeah.
Don't your testicles make noise?
sup, snitches
You might want to have it checked out if they dont.
i'm back
It can be a sign of a serious condition.
i heard there was a little drama earlier
Drama? Bronystate?
Yeesh, I remember that
wait, what?
When does that ever happen?
If there was, I wasn't here for it.
05this guys pretty good
Barbetos: all the god damn time
what did i miss?
I was there when it happened, actually
oh god you guys
oh fuck its emangamer XD
Yeah, since when does Bronystate have any drama? >_>
Just noticed it was one hand
05no?
That impressive
one arm? D:
So, is his left hand paralyzed or something? Or does he have some aspiration that requires his left hand to be free?
I bet he is popular with the ladies.
05he broke it
This man must have some kick-ass masturbation sessions.
-.-
What?

Barbetos, I have a theory about the next episode that makes more sense, but if I'm right, it would be a spoiler.
I'd never tell.
or not
I know what you can do.
Set Fantasy
Off.
Eh.
emangamer: yeah, a while back
like, a year ago-ish
I dun really care for theories or anything at this point.
In any case, I'm quite okay with keeping a lid on the talk about future episodes.
I just can't wait for more pony
Wrek
05doesnt matter
05theres a no talk rule in effect
05about unaired eps
05you dont have to be ok or not ok with it
05its not happenign anyways

:)
Who has the +s Chan Flag, Wrek?
Well then, thanks for the info
rather, he has +f
so that works just as well
All we really know is the title, and nothing else. Let's just keep it that way so we can all enjoy it.
^
niqqa he sleepin
ah well.
Alien "Critters", in Space Pirates and Zombies, the goons who get turned into zombies are called critters. I think the word zombie in that game only apply to the ships.

That'll do the trick.

Sharks have small brains, you see. All they know what to do is to swim, sense their prey, and eat it

Oh, and make new sharks

Polydunami, they can also learn that humans don't taste as good as seals, but they can only do so the hard way.
well i got to go

That's true

Also, humans can be resilient creatures when they know what to do
provided they want to turn off Tom
yeah.

...
Drugs are bad, mkay?
RaveBrony, agreed.
was just watching a video on a gang before I came here....strange
"What will you do if someone offers you drugs?" "Oh why thank you!"
drugs are very expensive now a days if someone offers em ill take it
Thats a shame
those are old numbers
13a person is smart, people are STUPID
aw missed em..
The Curse of Groupthink.
I bet religion is the source of all things evil :)
Woah
pony_2143 :)
13religion itself? no
...i'm tempted to make a comment about that and republicans...
but lets not start that
13people that take it too seriously? absolutely
^
Here we go, arguing about religion again... idiots...
05KrazyNoobs: no not really
13now shut up and take a hit of this muffin
05cause I dont allow it
Wrek :D
We listening to people dropping the "F" bomb and people worried about me calling religion evil?
pony_2143 - swearing is one thing. Religion and Politics just breeds flame wars
It is always good to have an admin controlling things... yesterday, a huge argument of religion broke out among this chatroom, and there were no admins.
It got really stupid.
speaking of TLJ... shown Volcano yet? I know, I do ask a lot
13not yet
Shizuka: ^
"You're Wrong!" "No You're Wrong"; 20 goto 10
Yah so stop believing in religion
HELLO
I had to debate in front of 3 classes Against my ex whether they should legalize weed or not (I was against legalization)
KrazyNoobs: there's always an admin if you know where to look :p
ok thanks Shizuka
05no really
pony_2143 Although you are smart, keep those views to yourself. That is likely to cause an outbreak of argument
13< a good portion of my friends smoked
05profanity isnt a problem here
Shizuka: you should know better than to use performance enhancing muffins
05but starting flamewars over politics and religion
05is a problem
05better drop it now
i agree
oh, Bullshit?
what's it goin on this time?
13NOOOO DON'T BAN THE DONUTS
O_O
lol
I make it a point to try not to flame people under any circumstances. Would it be a flamewar if only one side is flaming the other side?
vietnam has internet...
Kandarihu - nah, that's a Flamethrower
i'm guessing it's about drugs?
MakerDusk ?

13uh... penn.. normally i love ya but...
13those top three causes, are the primary factors that caused the crash... but what caused *them*
man here theres no top causes, you just get hit lol
"All of the Above"
13unsafe speed isn't the root cause, something caused you to travel at the unsafe speed
...wow, you'd never get away with a commercial like that
not today anyways
13which one the "this is your brain on drugs" or the pothead pulling up to the drivethru?
13that latter one was on at least in the late 90s i think
and you've seen the difference between 90s and 00s television
13true
Yeah, his reasoning isn't always spot on. This isn't even worth him having the last word on it.
the drivethru is what i was referring to, regardless
dat pot leaf desklamp

The difference between drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana, is that I don't become a secondhand drinker when people drink alcohol.

hello NocturnalBlade
Shizuka - yes, but how much of that is simple "f*** the government" mentality?
13even still
"Look at me government! I'm breaking the law!"
13it just comes across as immature

What is this?
I just turned this on and am confused...
penn and teller's bullshit

KrazyNoobs: what Yukikaze said lol
he doesn't want weiner to control his body krazynoobs
The only experience with marijuana is that one time, I went into a video game rental that smelled like what I thought was marijuana. It wasn't part of a chain AFAIK.

Now I have something to use against them.

98% of the time it was the dry cold wind
give me a dust storme and some big busgs and lizerds enny day
00,10I realy need to see if I can get my ps2 controler working on my PC again.

Wut

O_O
Do the police really have nothing better to do?

Sumica: it sounded so familiar to me because it was the name of my elementry school :3
00,10ah
I need to find a good deal on an XBOX 360 controller.
Punkie_Pue: well there was the time when they shot a old man dead in rushing the wrong apartment. He shot back however, but considering it was basically a home invasion then yeah.

The war on drugs kills more people than the drugs do.
Punkie_Pue: eeeeeeeeeeyup

they spend more one PRISONERS than SCHOOLCHILDREN
geeky, http://i.imgur.com/5g3hz.jpg
That was my next question
Pot is now legal, in some states...just move them there
AdamTheDuck: =3

What in all of hell??
yeah why is it that punishments for drug charges so harsh ?
Are we alowed to swear when the stream is of mature nature? I don't want to anger any mods.
Punkie_Pue I think so, better let an admin answer you
00,10hey wrek, I am sick of this place can I sleep on your couch?
this is bullshitstate now
the criminal justice is...oatmeal! yeah thats it,oatmeal!
O_o

God that poor man
He better have got money from that shit!

00,10I hope some fuckers swung over that one
KrazyNoobs: ok =3
I BET YOU they didn't give him ANY restitution over it
00,10this guy better be set for life
How does that work?
Sumica - unfortunately, the people responsible were probably already retired
it didn't work
I saw a documentary about prison life. The worst thing about innocent people going to prison is that they have to adapt to a prison culture that will either harden them into potentially violent criminals who cannot live outside of prison, or it will kill them.
IT FUCKING FAILED
though as i recall, he got something to the tune of 700k/year he was in
so much of his life wasted...
00,10wrongfull imprisonment.

You have to wash behind your ears, man.
Thass hygiene, -----
00,10man that must have sucked
Gawd, that was funny
00,10not only wrongfully imprisioned but no pain meds wither
Actually, the example shown wasn't an innocent person, but a young rapist. But a wrongfully accused and convicted person would have to put up with the same culture.
otakon: yeah at least Celestia and Luna arent like these idiots :D
Equestria is a monachy. Im sure they have problems. :)
Did he get his meds in jail? it would suck if he didnt
00,10well one positve for him
Who here has seen that Prison Shower scene from Boondocks?
Punkie_Pue: huh good point but it might better there than here :D
he probably got "some" meds
00,10hard to rape a man whos sitting down
i think he was in jail because he had a stockpile
Certainly.
not because of how much he was taking
that teller

Yukikaze: some times it missed... or it didn't go through all the way
05the guilliotine is actually one of the quickest and least painful execution methods
Drew, I clicked on the link again now and it's letting me vote again. Ballot-stuffing is wrong. If MLP FiM gets taken off the list for this, I wouldn't be surprised.
like an alca aeltzer lol
She <3 her job to much i think..
The head stays alive for 30 seconds
O_o
But the brain doesn't function
An actual shirt??
Shit
Artifact: i want to go there
EW
cool.
0_o
awesome
oh GOD
Anasthaesia, then euthanasia. Best method
Kandarihu: Yeah, it's pretty obvious that a lot of people are.
lethal injection
i think im going to hell
I like the episode where they talk about how removal of the heart couldn't be used to kill prisoners because a doctor would have to do it and...you know...hippocratic oath and all
geeky: what a concentration camp,or that museum
Artifact: the museume
hi all >.>
Lolwut
and then THIS
Actually, not sure if that's penn&teller or not...
I think being killed with mophine would be the most humane
Awww shit, it's a mime
hu Mutterdude
morphine
every other method of execution has a possiblily of failure
I'm thinking of toy story right now
mimes...the WORST kind of execution
Drew, this is the next great brony moral breakdown since the Fighting is Magic leak.
Death by mime
no call
lol
electrocution is a horrible way to die
You've got needles in me, you've got needles in me.
dat mime face at the end
Hahaha
anybody seen green mile
needles?!
Yukikaze ME
I have
05green mile is a fantastic movie
^
Potasium cloride is sold at grocery stores and a sodium free alternitive to salt.
It is, i love that
Yukikaze a good movie, amazing movie, strong message
You know what? I really should be working, see y'all!
on a side note, has anyone seen that Ace attourney MLP thing?
Wrek: Green Mile for A

See y'all!
Bye, donutpop365. :)

Bye AJIsAwesome!
oh my God
Artifact: i have! its neat
Artifact im waiting for part 4
Why is killing so haaaaaaaaaaard? :(
Yukikaze It was an interesting movie, the Green Mile. I loved how it tackled the flaws of the system, and the harmful effects of racism.
did you like it, most people dont But i do
TAKE THEM TO THE VET!
Kandarihu: It's really sad...people are going to start bringing it up a lot.
MEIN FUHRER
no
Oh damn
I did not know that
aight im back got me 2 oranges here ha ha haaaaa whoooooo!
hitler is not that bad i mean he killed hitler
Fire cures everything
Punkie_Pue: Did you like it
Sui_Generis: lol
Yeah, the guy who killed Hitler has all my respect.
(not)
yes Artifact I found it entertaining.
KrazyNoobs: You mean Hitler? :P
KrazyNoobs: hitler killed jitler
KrazyNoobs: hitler killed himself mook
Is part 4 out yet?
DUH
that was the joke
KrazyNoobs, lol. Hitler committed suicide.
I like the people who took care of Hitler's body after Hitler was killed
otakon does not get jokes
they burned it
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: me and two others
Petrified_Discord geeky otakon Kandarihu That was the joke
o_o
KrazyNoobs: ik
KrazyNoobs: i know
I also liked it,but heaps of people don't,the wall is just littered with insults on youtube
i hope it doesnt get to the point where as Rambo said something like "In time,Killing is as easy as breathing..."
Artifact I can immagine.
KrazyNoobs, I kinda figured. Sorry.
PURE EVIL MOTHERFUCKERS
great men.
btw, G-K is officially back on The Hub on Dec 14, prepare yourselves.
Scary people on the screen right now
CTHULHU: you made your self look like a ass
Zuul mother fuckers, zuul!
Well played, auto-kick. Well played.
KrazyNoobs: lol

Aany aus people
Drew, as do I . Let's go kill people.
05if you did i think you'd know
let's tell the thruth >_>
eraykaan: no
Poom: Cool, which city do we meet in?
i would think living in prison would be a worse punishment.
Artifact: it was abolished
Drew, Dallas.
evening everypony
Poom: too far..is sanantonio good?
Evening AppleBloom.
Morning Bloom
AppleBloom: hiya
Hey AppleBloom
heya AppleBloom
Wrek I would also recommend you ban any form of symbol used. Symbols can create words, easily, you know. Problem is, there are so many possible combinations, it would be quite a task.
alo AppleBloom
Hahaha
Symbols used to make the g word, Wrek, of course
This guy looks pretty badass
I'm still waiting for when it's releated to ponies/bronies
eraykaan Good luck with that
what's being streamed?
05KrazyNoobs: which combinatiosn come to mind?
idk
Artifact: reminds me of a police chief in those cop shows
There's a racial component to abortion on demand.
AppleBloom: Pen and Teller's show.
Bullshit, thats what
Penn and Teller: Bullshit
AppleBloom: a very very awesome show
pen and teller's bulls***?
WOOHOO!
a cooler version of tyler from Farenhieght
D:
05give me the first ocne comign to mind
I know that you already fixed @
But I will get one right now, Wrek
lol
:D
Ive pretty sure they cover a bunch when it comes to that word, lol
05heh
welp. later
Wrek, ₳, for example
here's a new plan: do not care about the stream, let's talk about ponies
O_o
05was hopign you'd say g@k
05and then be owned by the script
later Poom
Wrek I already did that before, I was kicked
O.o
eraykaan: OK Raritys the best pony
all because of a bullshit criminal investigation
eraykaan: I agree.
Sui_Generis: australia everypony
o.O
Artifact no! It's dashie!
Rarity is awesome :3
Applebloom best CMC?
what!?
wow!
121
RaveBrony: that is true
psh....scootaloo
It's all about Sweetiebelle
Wrek LO
AppleBloom: *cough* scootaloo *cough*
L
is dis sum Bullshit?
yup
Rainbow Dashis best pony!
My FAV pony is Rarity, and my FAV cmc is Sweetie Belle. lol
Haven't watched this in years lol
Wasn't he hung?
am i the only one who thinks of the Salume witch hunts
Dash and scootaloo
ALL ponies are all adorably equal :) except Tiara :D
period
Applejack and pinkie pie tied for best pony, and sweetie and applebloom tied for best CMC
all ponies are created equally.
no pony is best pony
Guise, please. Fluttershy is best pony
wait I dissconected wat happened?
Everypony is best pony
true dat.
Babs best single episode pony?
KrazyNoobs: NO RARITY BEST PONY
PARADOX?!
agreed Sui_Generis :)
So true!
Unavoidable paradox
Umm atcually yall everypony is best so eeyup
Cannot be avoided
Very true
Don't even try
I do not like babs
Artifact Rarity has good character development, I didn't like her too much in the first few episodes of Season 1, now I like her alot more. She is number 3 on my list
Kandarihu: no in erupe that was difrent that had jews and other relgons
All ponies are best ponies. :)
Artifact: why not?
I feel bad for babs..
why didn't babs go camping with the cmc?
05she was back in manehatten
geeky, it was still wrong.
because she's a city gal?
Yeah, she went back to the city
HAHA PUN
She went to a Smashing Pumpkins concet
Babs seed was awesome, and I have that song caught in my head o.O
Kandarihu: the salume witch hut was staerd by 3 very bord gills
Lives in ManeHatten, but has more of a Boston accent. Pony logic?
*girls
AppleBloom: Well, I geuss its because I don't like episodes that focus on bullying
isn't Penn an athiest?
I thought it was more a bronx accent.
Babs seed is one of my favorites
Dat song in S3E4
Raritys the best pony
Yukikaze, yes he is.
No such thing as best pony, lol
Artifact: well it is a kid show, and that being the case bullying would be in there at one point or another
RaveBrony: i agree
AppleBloom: but the song in that episode is awesome
only yellow quiet is the greatest
Imagine how long the wait will be for Season 4... I'm estimating 9 - 11 months... :(
and that demon horse is terrible
D:
i love the parody called Red Spy!
Punkie_Pue Same
What are we watching?
KrazyNoobs: enjoy S3 and dont think about the futer
O.o

05oh right
05it might use eng by default
have a nice dream about ponies
At least theres no 4kids here
revy is the SHIT!!
05if it does i gotta switch to VLC
oh allo AdamTheDuckhow you doing?
i stay up every night untill 6 over here cause at 6 thats when i go to sleep so yeah
fact: everyone in this show smokes
05it is
the show's good in either language
Wha, huh?
was trigun ever streamed on here?
?????
05but you guys apparently dont midn so
que?
Artifact: lol now im imagining 4kids trying to dub Black Lagoon :D
... ... ... que?
what?
Oh, yeah, Black Lagoon. I have a bit of a confession to make. When Wrek started streaming this, I was honorbanned. But I still watched the stream. What's worse is that I honorbanned myself because Wrek himself kicked me for discussing an upcoming episode.
00,10still have not goten MPC working wrek?
he had to set up the dubbed audio
05Sumica: nah im usign the built in
Sketch_Toku_Brony: I almost thought they were gonna dub Code Geass back in the day
05doesnt have an audio source pick
Honorbanned?
Artifact: lol i hope they shut down before THAT happens :D
rainbow dash is best rainbow dash
otakon is asking for the twins ep
isn't this the first episode of the second barrage?
no I'm not
hell no
the twins
/me shudders
A few days later, I honorban myself again around the beginning of BMN, and I handle it properly, banning myself from the stream too.
anyone think they're going to have a CMC episode based in the future of their lives?
The only thing 4kids is good at is the original Yu-Gi-Oh and Pokemon
Lol
._.
So, I think I'm caught up with this, but only because I committed an honorary network offense.
yeah idiot
05hai gilda
He died as he lived...typing.
Yay, shaving commercial
honorary offense, how does that work
Revy is best drunkard
Wrek thanks now everytime i see Gilda,im gonna hear drop the F bomb everytime she on screen :D
Actually Revy sounds like someone from the walking dead game..
Oh snap
Damn
Artifact: how is the walking dead game?
Lolwut
as i walk through the shadows in the valley of death... I would bring a flashlight
AppleBloom: Its a heart wrenching story that would put any man to tears
nun with a gun
for those who haven't seen the series....Buy it!
TheGreatAndPowerfulT, the way I meant it to work is that a real ban is only from the IRC, but an honorban applies to all of Bronystate-related services. IRC, stream, and outside contact with members of the community.
Hah
It is one of the best series ever made
Nun is the best gun weilder
lol closed church
I love the scene that's coming up
PPPPPANTSU
suddenly panty shot
Hah, wut
lol
yeah nothing like a city of scumbags
Gods a badass
kag
welp dun pissed them off
Luke 11:??
and LET THE KICKASS BEGIN
lol the bible doesnt say that XD
the bible is the best source of qoutes
Bottemless clips?
hacks
god mode
o_o
reply "yes" if this chat's getting off topic
APE REVY
Artifact, yeah, but I think it's obvious they're riddled with extrabiblical doctrines. Tsk tsk tsk
Dem teeth o.o
doomed!
It be funny if the goldeneye gun glitch happened
y'know when they all dance
Bible seems very liberal in this
Oh shit
Golden gun....
O.O
SHE'S GOT THE GOLDEN GUN
dat Nun is EPIC :D
O_O
ONE SHOT KO
dat Deagle... I think
Leave it to the nuns to have the best weapons
i'm out
3D, thats the nasty stuf in anime
*stuff
Yukikaze, I'm calling extrabiblical doctrines on this.
GO INTERWEBZ
:D
tl;dr
oh god I don't care... get to the shooting
money lecture
'extrabiblical doctrines'? is that like the da vinci code?
SHUT UUUPPP
5 HOURS LATER...
Mutterguy: I think its the stuf at the end
theone thing one all of their minds are, Im going to kill her
1000 years later*
Mutterguy: o the bible
*of
Hah
Mutterguy, it's where a pastor starts preaching according to something other than the word of God. Like philosophers or something.
they're both fake
TE BOTH THE FAKIES
Come to think of it, that's what the Catholic church was doing when Martin Luther rebelled and founded the Protestant church.
Hahahaha
the reformation Kandarihu
Artifact, yes
:L
No one ever listens when it comes to anachy
isnt oprah off the air?
Lol
god I love revy
AppleBloom: yes
Oprah was still on air when the dub was made
Oprah got trolled pretty badly :)
God wants more money
OWN
Luke 16:??
Gods just in it for the moniez
They found a plannet made out of diamonds :D
Thats for Catholic church, Artifact
I was missing Black Lagoon? Dang
So what is the occasion?
Im a planet made out of diamonds
Florida is not Texas
Bad Japan
Floridian cowboy. Seems legit.
suddenly cowboy?
that guy aint from florida
ooooooooookay
From florida, looks like a cowboy, perfect logic
Hey its the guy from the extra turnabout in the ds Ace attourney
We didn't change that fact, you guys.

Artifact, I've seen a few 3D CGI anime series in my time.
He's like the pyro smoker kid at school. Nerdy guy modding his Bics
fire cures everything
Assassin carpool
Moopy: its cupcakes right there
Artifact Have you seen Hoshii No Kaabii? Too much 3D in that anime. (It's the Kirby anime)
So much cupcake ingredients

Nice map. How close are you to being done?
Sorry, I meant: :D :D All you have to do is take a cup of flour, add it to the mix. :D :D
hey what game is that
05been working on it for the past 2 days
Starcraft 2, I think
05its a standard tourney 1v1
05its currently playable
Polydunami, it is.
05as in it has all the bases and all presets needed
Now take something sweet not sour, a bit of salt, just a pinch
05it misses backround terrain and final touchign ups
05aswell as balancing
good night everypony, havea awesome day tomorrow, or today depending on your time zone
Good night, AppleBloom
Does it favor protoss, terran, or zerg? Or is it very balanced?
05also i think i crashed the stream client
Goodnight AppleBloom
Wrek, will the balancing require playtesting?
Whoops
Goodnight applebloom
bugger
05Yukikaze: ive been tryign to favor all as much as possible. makign sure locations arent siegeable
05easely atleast
05once i playtest i will know more

I didn't see the map very well. Was there any destructible rocks?
05not designed with those in mind
05might block of 4th or 5th bases with them
Right, just went off air
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXHMPpPjVr4
:>
So basically a fast paced map at this point
No.
05yes albeit large
Yay, slideshow.
Montage time
Gmod voices really really bug me.
LUNA
05heres a screenshot
dat twilight "a"
I like symphony better then Octavia and vinyl
Who?
Hacker https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-8sxEVsTq0&feature=plcp
05though Yukikaze I jsut finished shapign and texturign the main island
Shes sorta like octavia
and looks cooler
D'awwww.
If she's an OC, then I don't really give much of a damn
Okay, back online
05here you go Yukikaze: http://i.imgur.com/Prt5v.jpg
Hey i have a question for minecraft for the xbox: for the dispencer and put a couple gun powder in it can a creeper pop out of the dispencer?
Polydunami: what's so bad about OC's?
The dub of Black Lagoon isn't all that bad.
I enjoy this show
I never said OCs were bad, CTHULHU
05the dub featuers many MLP voices
Actually saw MELL in concert when she was in the states a few years ago
Tabitha being one
What I mean is that Octavia appeared in the show but I don't remember this Symphony at all
Black Lagoon has a badass opening
Really? Who does Tabitha play?
Tabithat is the dub voice of the maid right Wrek ?
05yes
*Tabitha
Oh, I know the maid character
Polydunami: no shes not http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/File:Violin_pony_s02e09.png
Oh
Well, then
I do like her design, that's for sure
Ashleigh was hansel
wrek: from the north and south mineral points is there a way to reach the main?
I do like her design, that's for sure
00,10that guy sounds just like Setsuna F seyay
00,10only happyer
05Yukikaze: tehres a reaper/blinker-observer reach
05but not a ramp
so zerg has to work to make any attemps work
Sumica: It is the same guy
PANTSU
ew
05luckily my main map tester maisn masters zerg :)
Its a flawless plan
http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=6832 for those who were wondering who voiced what character in the dub
Cathy Weseluck voices a character in this anime
Wrek: would mass zergling or roach bust through to reach natural?
LOL
this show is amazing
in the first season she voiced Garcia
more pantsu
Yep
4/7, nice
hi
It worked! LOL
yeah...the only mlp va that you'll hear in the second barrage is Ashleigh
Ohai aniderp|bestcakeever
hey ashleigh ball
00,10ah and the girls voice
05the main has 1 ramp to the natural, that has 1 ramp to the major battlefield.
celery
dat jaymoo on?
Speaking of Cathy Weseluck, we should watch CyberSix sometime
CELERY!!!
must confess, this show is pissing me off
05the map is pretty open with only 2 real chokes
05being main base
APPLEJACK WHATA YOU DOING IN BLACK LAGON
Buytoast, really? You?
she sounds like applejack
can't stand people like these ones
ugh, heart burn to the max! :(
Ashleigh Ball does voice a couple of characters in this show
Applejack best getaway driver
Buytoast, okay, I understand.
SO ASIAN
Moopy: She does the voice to some charcters and i just noticed
ikr
WTF is with Florida cowboys
Yeah, this show pretty much runs on Black and Grey morality.
good map..... I have to see test plays of this. From the way it looks Zerg is going to have a hard time, but I don't play SC2 that much.
holy shit this chick could be like pinkamena
Ahaha, Tabitha voices a maid who takes care of a boy voiced by Cathy Weseluck
05Yukikaze: im hopign the openess of the main area and the close 3rd evens it otu a bit
poly, that would be Garcia
RAINBOW DASH WATTA YOU DOING IN BLACK LAGON
Yeah, Garcia. And the maid is Roberta
I'm still waiting for the R1 release of Roberta's Blood Trail
05i cant say untill it gets playtested
I have not seen this anime for a while
05then i can adjust accordingly
Saw the first episode at Anime Expo when it was announced
05the cake(map) is fresh out of the oven and needs some frosting and sprinkles (balancing) ;)
05<3
all I have to say to that is....Yey blood
Wrek: what about a mass muta?
<_<:D <=Get out o here
*of
This is how haxoring actually works
Wrek: Frosting? Just put it outside, and before you know it I'm sure it'll be.... Iced...
Ashleigh Ball? She'd not the voice of Revy you know
*she's
05map has yet to be tested, massing mutas should work fairly normally
all you gotta do is make banelings
400 banelings and you can't be stopped
revy is Gilda / Spits
Nevermind muta will probably be melted by marines or stalker
Polydunami: I know but shes voiced some characters in the show
That much, I know
Just, not until tonight
/me points to the link that he had posted earlier
05brb gettign some quick breakfast
05also awesome minigun is awesome
and on that note, I'm going to flee for the night

Hay bacon strips

KrazyNoobs: 'im talking about real bacon dude.
Equines are herbivores, so they wouldn't consider eating any meat.
CTHULHU: Well there not pigs, so there would/nt be canbalistic ponys everywhere,...
*'
If they did, though, their digestion system would probably fail in some ways.
I want a pony that eats meat.
that would be cool

08,01hi KrazyNoobs
KrazyNoobs: really?
Im psyced about this friday - not sure if watch movie night or Hobbit in theatre :)
08,01unfortunately, i can't stream for you; i have an exam tomorrow and am deep in studying
Cypresswolf: Always choose ponies
>deep in studying
>on chat
>logic.
08,01(taking a break at the moment, obviously)
KrazyNoobs: You're Right! There ARE ponies in the Hobbit ^_^
08,01must not kickban Meanwhile... must not kickban Meanwhile...
Cypresswolf: Then go and watch it! :D
Da hayall?
It's sometime good to be a NEET.
Hehehe.
08,01OOOO, MAIL
btw, How do you enter the movie night lottery? Do you really get insta-perma banned if your movie is chosen?
Yes, that's how it works.
aww ;_;
I hope that is sarcasm
It isn't.
I want to hear it from an admin before I believe it
if meanwhile gets picked then he gets it i think
But assuming you did get insta-perma banned for having your movie chosen, WHY WOULD THAT BE!?
/me noms on Meanwhile -.-
08,01KrazyNoobs: because we hate you all
If I get picked I'll get rerolled without anyone saying anything.
08,01Meanwhile: that's because you pick shit films
You clearly have no taste.
With your Requiem for a Dream headache.
Cinderella 1997... WHO CHOSE THAT ONE!?
KrazyNoobs: only if your movie choice get WMC - worst movie clause
11,02Speed Racer was an awesome movie~
^
08,01Meanwhile's picks are insta-wmc
Like I said, no taste
LOL, How do you choose a movie? I get led to this graph, but what do I do from there?
woudl you guys like if elf or polar express got picked from my lotto thingy?
08,01anyhoos, i loved requiem for a dream
That says it all really. :P
how do you join the lottery?
how do you join the lottery?
08,01it was a good film!
08,01like trainspotting
I'd like to see Monkey Bone get chosen, just to see if that is WMC worthy - I like to think it is
11,02KrazyNoobs: Enter the lottery survey by going to http://survey.bronystate.net
08,01but less cheery
who likes polar express?
11,02That signs you up for the newsletter.
i get an email tomorow i think?
11,02Yeah
11,02Just need to finish dat newsletter >>;
SuperBrony64: *no survey available*
08,01we really need a better way of signing up to the newsletter
'No available surveys'
08,01you can't sign up unless there's an active survey
11,02KrazyNoobs: You have to wait until a survey is created, it's when the newsletter goes out.
08,01whcih there won't be until newsletter
How do I sign up for the newsletter?
08,01it's a catch-22
11,02Once the survey is available
k, thanks
08,01you sign up to the newsletter- when there's a survey available
guess what my cursor for my laptop is :P
08,01you know when there's a survey available because we send out a newsletter
08,01it's a never-ending cycle of disappointment
11,02You sign up for the newsletter when it's too late to sign up for the newsletter.
08,01just like Meanwhile's sex life
Did the a------ who chose Cinderella (1997) get WMC?
08,01(i <3 you really, man)
and mine!
11,02YOU ARE THE INSULT MASTER - 500 PTS
stream ded?
If it were really like my sex life it'd be nonexistant. <3
If an admin chose Cinderella 1997, i take that back

G/\k is just very silly.
He said that the ₲₳₭ company itself doesn't controll how many ads appear in a row. That is all up to The Hub. Now bronies are tweeting the Hub to make ₲₳₭ go 8 times in a row. LOL

hi
howdy anon pony_2456
how are you this morning?
sleepy, stressed
hmm, stressed about what?
Final exams
I got only one today, but you never can feel too good about a college final
ya, those are always stressful
ouch, well good luck with that
Here's hoping. Its not too hard a class, so much as just a mass wave of info
I've spent all morning so far shoveling snow -.-
I would prefer to shovel snow than take an exam, myself
there's a least 18 inches out there, maybe more in the spots that driffted
and we have a giant driveway to shovel, lol
Still better than exams
I think i'd rather take exams
MadSurge: my god, someone else lives. And trust me, you have no idea how much I secretly study you all...
...
you weren't supposed to hear that...
Sylandest: well you don't study ME in particular, so I'm not worried :D
MadSurge: thats what *you* think~
/me slaps Sylandest around a bit with a large trout
/me slaps Jmo around a bit with finals
/me slaps Sylandest around a bit with a large trout
Het Jmo
/me slaps Jmo around a bit with finals
*hey
/me slaps Sylandest around a bit with a large trout
MadSurge: I'm not sure if I read up on that or not. What did he find?
I'm hungry, skap me too
*slap
/me skaps MadSurge
MadSurge: Well, technically, they do, according to what we've been taught. But its not a bad label, as that connotation is often applied. Its more just that they oppose or do not follow society's typical tracks
Sylandest: indeed
...mine's fancier!
:P
I am not fancy :D
mmm
40k followers for princess molestia
Sylandest: but you are the student, so it's normal you have fancier words~
sweet mother of god, thats a lot of followers
MadSurge: I can read! :D
Bronysith: you count as 40000 people? :D
apparently
mod's asleep? Post pon- oh wait -_-

yeaaaaaaaah, no not really
I remember when this was relevent http://www.dennyweb.com/singing_horses.htm

CrystalPhoenix: lol?
Bronysith, you don't know about singing horses?
Woah, hey there, emangamer!
chat requires more epic final boss music http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndF1y85o4Qw
Hey guys ^_^
It's quite annoying that the battle is about 1 or 2 hours long
How's everyone doing today? :D
good thing the music is good enough to compensate
TwilightSonata: oh hey its the newfoal
sorry, but everyones a newfoal for about 6 months
TwilightSonata: i was told about you, just dont screw this up XD
and I love it only because of the choir
Huh? Screw what up?
I'm so confused...
CrystalPhoenix: isnt the final boss more like 30 hours?
glad im not a newfoal
Bronysith, if you suck
CrystalPhoenix: theres a 10 hour version of that song
What song?
Hi Bronysith and emangamer :3
[10:00:41] <emangamer> glad im not a newfoal , HAHAHAHHAHAA what a lie
I've witness the final boss myself and the guy manage to beat it in about 2-3 hours and he had some difficulty
I don't think I've seen you two around before...
maybe 4
TwilightSonata: im usually lurking
Come to think of it I haven't seen most of the people here haha x
Bronysith, because looping is always fun right?
I'm usually here at night
it's not ten hours it's just the same song on repeat
CrystalPhoenix: goddamn it, why are JRPGs final bosses always so long of a fight?
CrystalPhoenix: still awesome song
Because it's THE
moment
/me farts in emangamer s face
O//O
Well Epic Battles aren't short
haha, classic
How rude...
it's to keep the climate of the game
[Alpha]: this is true
Of course
then again some games are overdoing it
CrystalPhoenix: i mean safer sepiroth is like an hour long battle if you dont have knights of the round XD
So like, um, could you guys tell me some stuff about yourselves then?
pretty much
CrystalPhoenix: or the final raid boss in the MMO FFXI is a 48 hour boss fight
until they nerfed him
I am always hungry I
I'm kinda new to this whole online chat thing, ahahha... ^^
TwilightSonata: run
yea

TwilightSonata: Just read the rules, and youlll have a great time :)

Bronysith: Huh? It can't be that bad here, right?

RaveBrony: Already read them ^__^

TwilightSonata: Nice : D

CrystalPhoenix: thank you mao
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv6xwv4_fuo
Asleep
It's a meme that died 5 years ago
but people still use it because they have no imagination
4chan? I've heard of that from some of my friends but I dunno what it really is, haha...
Vivix: it is a reason why 9gag and memebase still exist
People here are usually very nice, but when it's busy, it's not always so nice
yup
I would avoid it
Sorry, I don't normally use the internet outside of facebook, this is all kinda new to me >.>
Vivix: or you use it for satire like I do
I don't read memebase or 9gag
4chan is a magical place
a magical, fucked up place
imageboard for anime and japan stuff
emangamer, that use is still around yeah
No it's not
well that's what it used to be
satire is best form of comedy
false
Imageboard?
Hehe
Magical at all
false
So is it like, a forum?
Bronysith: you goddamn ninja
Yes
sort of yeah
TwilightSonata: this > is called a chevron along with these two < ^

gimmie gimmie
from what i heard its a good port
http://imgur.com/ToQy9
http://imgur.com/DaOE6 JRP2234
JRP2234: it's not a port, it's a whole different game!
http://imgur.com/t7dhU JRP2234
MadSurge it still uses dooms engin
its techincaly a port
evil point bit level hacking
god, some of these photoshops are really good
JRP2234: it's more like a wad then
Morning.
Dat fluffeh
So I guess you're all guys here then? :P
MadSurge doom 64 is a hevily modified doom engin
AttackWithHugs! <3
hey AttackWithHugs
Hi emangamer
MadSurge! <3
TwilightSonata: not AttackWithHugs :D
what's up
Eh, woke up about 10 minutes ago.
MadSurge: Oh, awesome :3
duke nukem 64 isent a port
duke nukem sucks
it uses a difrent game engin instead of build
Nice to know there are other chicks on here ^_^
it's time to kickass and chew bubblegum
Have class tomorrow so I have to ask my niece's dad if he can watch her. Or his sister.
and I'm all out of gum
http://i.imgur.com/t2Xtd.jpg
and duke nukem is a fag
Bronysith yes the new one sucks but the old ones were awesome
^
nah
AttackWithHugs: So I guess you're a fellow pegasister? Hahaha x
duke was the king
nah
DOOM guy is still king of shooters
TwilightSonata, yes.
AttackWithHugs: *o* SO PRETTY
even though doom is retardedly overrated
Sadly, yes
I liked doom as a kid, but it's not the best game of all time
and so is goldeneye
MadSurge, I want that cotton candy. So much diabetes to be had afterwards, but worth it.
and ocarina of time
I didn't even know goldeneye was popular
and chrono trigger
AttackWithHugs: That's awesome, I haven't met many other girls who like MLP before, surprisingly enough XD
and final fantasy 7
of course neither doom or golden eye are the best game ever of all time
AttackWithHugs: indeed :D
Vivix: to be fair, it brought FPS to the consoles >.>
that game toes to Drake of the 99 dragons
Bronysith, oh yeah- that's true...
plus as far as I know I'm the only one at school who watches it...
Legend of dragoon is probably my fav RPG right behind chrono trigger
doom was the cod backthen
/me smacks JRP2234
no
OVERRATTED
well yea
CoD is overrated, not a bad game but it is the same game rereleased every single fucking year
theres always that one game thats over rated
but heres the thing
overrated=/=bad
true
cod 89 is just the same game as cod 66
die in a final burst
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1355151635828.png
At least Doom had different enemies instead of one guy with different guns
overrated==more hyped than it's worth
guys apparently we all die in 10 days
That is awesome
final fantasy 7 is super fucking overrated
JRP2234: suuuuure :D
I play CoD sometimes, my ex used to play it the whooole time haha
but still one of my fav games of all time
Heya everyone :)
Call of Duty is lame
heres why i stoped playing
ITS
FUCKING
BORING
I never really got into it, but the multiplayer is fuuun ^_^
cloud, even though he is a whiny bitch, is still somewhat a likeable character, he gets WAAAAAAAAAAAAAY too much hate
the same crap every year
I like the storyline though
i mean hes nowhere near as awesome as say, Dart Feld, or Terra
^^^
JRP2234: I mean, it's fun for the first little while but it does get old pretty fast
^^
TwilightSonata: I prefer Team Fortress 2 :)
of course
team fortress 2 is pretty much win >.>
and half life
god
my friend got all the tropies in 1 day
1
another retardedly overrated game
DAY
MadSurge: I've never played Team Fortress 2... is it a ps3 game?
Steam
TwilightSonata: PC
tf2 is fun
TwilightSonata: no, Steam and Xbox
thats the diffrence
and Steam is far surperior
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7l5tybm2LDE have fun
it's okay, but TF2 isnt for everyone
Ohhh, I don't have an xbox and my pc is really sucky haha
the actual encourge you to mod
they*
yeah but that's valve being valve
TF2 is what games are supposed to be, pure fucking fun
TwilightSonata: I know that feeling :D at least it's free to play
http://i.imgur.com/RpEON.jpg
So anyone have pony mods for TF2?
gaben]
I hate how everyone pissed on Shadowrun for being multiplayer only but that's all that TF2 is
left 4 dead 2 is also fun when you have a full party of people WHO KNOW HOW TO FUCKING PLAY THE GAME RIGHT
I look strange without my beard.
AttackWithHugs: dat unfortunate naming

you realize that dark souls is a sequel to demon's souls right?
it isnt
just spiritutal
spiritual
Bronysith: easy, Demon's Souls is still under Sony's copyright while Dark Souls isn't
in the same way dark cloud 2 is a sequal to dark cloud
MadSurge: oh yea
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5253/
Dark souls isnt a direct sequel to demons souls dumbass
I loved Dark Cloud
/me freaking looooooves dark cloud 2
dark cloud is a mess of a game
dark cloud /2/
way better
still a mess of a game
it takes dungeon crawling to a stupid level
your mom's a mess of a game
enough about your sex life

MadSurge, what's Ponygoons?
Who have drawn all them pics we are looking at :O?
is it the mods?
I think some.
“I had Scootachicken put a mirror in front of his door, so he won’t be going anywhere for a while.” “What, is he a weeping angel now?” “No, but it always reminds him that he’s played by Matt Smith, and that usually has him raging at his own reflection for about an hour.”
OH GOD....The matt smith jokes
AttackWithHugs: it's the forum of this site called The Round Stable. It was made by Something Awful goons because the SA thread was eventually gassed
AttackWithHugs: it's also a very nice place and you can talk about ponies with reasonable people :D
MadSurge: like Bronystate?
Alchemist: kinda, yes, but without saucy images :D
oh
so spec ops the line received a 7/10 cause game informer said the multiplayer was uninventive?

Spec ops the line is awesome!

Everlasting_Joy: reading the otakon x daribot ship fic
oh god the nastolgia
nostalgia
emangamer: I think it was read here live once. It was weird.
Everlasting_Joy: it's fucking amazing
"Otakon turned as well, once more gazing into the pitch black eyes of Daribot. Nervously, almost hesitantly, he closed the gap between them, reached out, and took the cold metallic hands in his own. Smiling, a single tear sliding down his left cheek, Otakon closed his eyes and pressed his lips again the unmoving lips of Daribot."
CrystalPhoenix: we dont know. But seeing how Ingram is aware of her and obviously endorses her, she might have a bright future.
indeed
gives me a warm fuzzy fantasy of everyone involved in FiM being best friends and hanging out together
emangamer: Yep, that's the one :D.
Everlasting_Joy: ofc it is, it's amazing
emangamer: I laughed so hard that day
AttackWithHugs: you should read all of the moderator series

Meanwhile: But it isn't the NC, so the VS can get away with it... Magic *snort snort.
NC.....North Carolina or Nostalgia Critic.....i'm lost
Everlasting_Joy: Ikr. Seriously, Esamir's name should just be changed to Vanumir. 80% of the map all day and convoys steamrolling every point of resistance. If I could snipe through the warpgate dome I'd just stay there.
00,10shame they nerfed mines just after I got them too
Sumica: Are you going to play PS2 if/when the servers come back up?
00,10not sure

sotp sucking so hard
why do I want to play this
just another way to rape fans of their wallets
emangamer: the mega man part of it?
Street Fighter VS Megaman.......Capcom, Y U SO GREEDY?
street fighter x megaman is another way of stealling money from players
with on disc DLC and releasing the same game 6 months later witha bonus character
goddamnit capcom
stop being such assholes
this is proof they left Marvel VS Capcom 3 DEAD
street fighter x tekken didnt work
so fucking stop
Y U NO ADDED VENOM? Spiderman in Venom suit wasn't enough
though UMvC3 is fun
it is an insult to their consumers
whatever, i thank them for adding DEADPOOL and PHEONIX WRIGHT
Dark92Enigma: hell yea

Hello everyone. Is the streamer taking suggestions?
Why to male anime heros have such weird hair?
Lunac: no
praise the lord :P

lali-ho Lunac
SpadeKyurem: Cloud strife
Hi Deacon EVTrain
Some of the names in here are too long.
SpadeKyurem becuase they use loreal
i cant believe this is the last week of the semester
holy shit
luna <3 :3
Deacon|EVTrain: Because they're worth it?
I know that feel, Bronysith
dat EileMonty cover <3
SpadeKyurem exactly!
/me glomps AttackWithHugs :3
though the PMV is meh
it doesn't know what style it wants to be
yay ponies
/me pokes Ponies47 :3
/me squeezes Ponies47
not sure what luna would think about ravers since they do party literally all night
Ya know luna, most ponys sleep during the night, maybe thats why they dont apreciate it
luna
and it just doesn't blend well together
you should be more grateful
woona
this must've been out a few weeks ago
couples make love at the nighttime
personally I prefer to sleep all day though :P
or I just haven't heard that many fan songs
Its a good song, though...im impressed.
thelonepony|school, Dang it man! Focus! Get back to work! :D
naw
:3
Sylandest, were you doubting Ponyphonic?
Picture perfect pony=greatest fan song ever
/me takes thelonepony|school's computer
Okie doki loki then thelonepony|school :3
And fan animation
Bronysith, I disagree
CrystalPhoenix: I wasn't. First time I've heard it.
fanimation yes
but song no
Dusks dawn=worst fan animation ever
^
I still think that Luna basically had a tantrum or something because she didnt consider most ponies might be sleeping at night? so maybe thats why they dont apreciate it?
and cause, i'm almost done with a project :3
you know who i'd think would love luna the most? military people. since they often operate at night, and they're less likely to be spotted :P
FUCKING 4 KIDS
DIE
ikr
DIE 4KIDS DIE
Bronysith: Thats a rule for anime in general
00,104kids did't do digimon
digimons 4 the champions
00,10Saban did
SpadeKyurem: i liked the english version of gurren lagann
/me slaps naturesfury
Sumica it's still 4kids fault
Considering Luna's a dreamwalker you think she would've been fine with ponies sleeping at night.
:C
Sumica: At least that's a plus...
someway
4 kids ruined One piece
Bronysith: but it sooooooooo good
You know that blue haired chick from One piece?
so damn catchy
SpadeKyurem: didnt they skip an entire story arc in the middle of a sentence?
LOVE THAT HAIRY THING
I forgot her name
:D
your anime ruined by the dub version? blame 4kids
Turns out SHE DIED
and they NEVER MENTION IT
am i the only one that liked the 4th series of digimon?
could be nostalgia glasses
Bronysith, 4th series?
or generation, whatever
00,10Digimon Frontiear?
that cGi :d
Sumica: the ones where the kids transform into the digimon
>Digimon Frontier
00,10it was kinda meh
was that the one where all the main digimon were humanoid?
ah
DIGIMON
FRONTEIR
Tokyo OF COURSE WHY NOT
Bronysith: damn, i love the opening
GET OUT.
SpadeKyurem: the chick from the desert?
00,10not bad, certnly not as bad as the D foce one
from that Gen.
Sumica: d foce?
Zawan: Idk its been ages
00,10D force
d force?
00,10the digi cops
what about Digimon tamers?
/me kindly escorts Bronysith out <3
But turns out she got killed in the original version
00,10was the 5th gen
Sumica: where that guy punches to get power?
00,10yeah
4kids edited that plot point out
/me takes AttackWithHugs to bed
:D
that face
So a character basically just disappears for no reason
SpadeKyurem: 4kids
Bronysith: digimon tamere is pretty good, i have volume 2 atm
tamer*
woah
what happened to the animation?
Nihoni and Nippon means Japan ?
it got
good
MaxTheBrony, just about
like
I love how NO one NOTICES THIS AT ALL
original evangelion to rebuilds good
holy shit the animation is good now
the hell happened?
SpadeKyurem: im guessing they suddenly got a budget
00,10they do that for this show
this song sounds familier
inb4 nobody's home
00,10so you can tell they are in the real world
How big a jump in animation is this?
SpadeKyurem: see the nose on tai?
Also why does no one react to this kid carrying a pink creature?
its japan
SpadeKyurem: its japan
a little girl reacted earlier
They're used to strange shit
japan is guarded by giant mechs 24/7
im sure they see freakier shit
lol
:D
00,10lol coke and kraft parmishan cheese
that round thingy xD
w...what
Did that say coke a cola?
Or am I seeing things
its only been a day?
SpadeKyurem: it did
00,10not even a day
http://s3.vidimg02.popscreen.com/original/47/eE5QRjdHZ0hweDgx_o_giant-my-little-pony-horse-in-skyrim-rainbow-dash.jpg
00,10it's the same day
PRODUCT PLACEMENT!
Did time stop or something?
lol gdlk_ouo xD
gdlk_ouo: Lol
So basically several days in the Digital World=1 day in the real world
00,10just a few hours later that same day
SpadeKyurem: or went back in time
SpadeyKyurem it's like narnia basically
ah
Kari
ONI CHAN
hello favorite character in the show ever
NOW YOU FUCKED UP
If all of that was a dream, you must have smoked some serious weed
...
what
is with her face
GET A NOSE
shes all "ive seen some shit"
Ok she'd creepy
I think this part is referencing the movie
/me throws a crucifix at Sumica
So cute :3
Guys, if you don't get why Kairi remembers Koromon...
AttackWithHugs: IT NEVER HAPPENED
MaxTheBrony, thelonepony|school try to search 'Giant "My Little Pony" Horse in Skyrim ( Rainbow Dash )' on youtube if want more :D
Watch the freaking first act of the freaking movie.
ONI CHAN
xD
VenHur: the movie sucks
Ok if Kairi and Sora are in this, where are Riku, Donald and Goofy? :P
yamato? thats the name of my weapons in PSO
:C
three?
Bronysith: True, but the first act is the most cannon of the three.
Deacon|EVTrain: Thats why it felt so disjointed?
I thought it was two.
VenHur: *canon
ONII CHAN
SpadeKyurem: Riba, dolan and gooby went to the Digimon world to find hi,
Diaboromon and then Kokomon
it was three or two, can't remember
Ribu*
Also the movie apperently shows that Monks get wi-fi
him*
Holy shit
that looks good
Im always confused when I watch an anime...
Jesus, tai.
MaxTheBrony: tastie ^_^
Fucking control yourself.
Is it me or is the animation better in this episode>
looks like hot eggs on rice
00,10rice omlet
:P
?*
I guess the animation is good because it must be of been animated by the same guys that animated the movie...
hot eggs on rice could be good
Koromon farteds <3
Ew
:C
Where's the ongiri, oh im sorry, JELLY DONUTS
Digimon don't handle human food too well
SpadeKyurem: 4kids?
Pooping all over the place
Scrambled eggs with rice and salt is great.
Omurice. An omelette wrapped around fried rice, (usually chicken) and topped with catsup. A great favorite with Japanese children.
wetting the bed and sitting all over the table are a bit of a jump from eachother
shitting*
Educate them on fucking culture
SpadeKyurem: but...kids are stupid...
Can't be that hard to explain what a rice ball is
ONI CHAN
its a fucking ball of rice
SpadeKyurem: what is this...ball
of rice...
i dont understand...
Jelly donut does nto work at al
VIRUS
SpadeKyurem: thats what 4kids thinks kids act like
SpadeKyurem: Not stupid-- but honestly, how many US kids are gonna know what an onigiri IS? No, make it seem... familiar.
DONUTS HAVE HOLES
call norton
SpadeKyurem: what about donut holes?
Kencolt: It cant be that hard to explain what it is
SpadeKyurem I'd still like a jelly donut shaped like a riceball
what does onii chan mean? little brother?
SpadeKyurem: Jelly Doughnuts do not have holes.
SpadeKyurem: or eclairs?
Bronysith: the fact they tried to pass off Onigiri as jelly donuts
is bullshit
i know SpadeKyurem i know
Alchemist: older or younger
SpadeKyurem: but lets let it go with that 4KIDS FUCKIGN SUCKS DUCK FUCKERS
00,10he's trippen balls
Do people like 4kids just think all kids are ignorant idiots?
Sumica: IM TRIPPING BALLS
Sumica: I feel fine!
onii-chan is little sister/brother
Oh wait there it goes
onee-chan is older brother/sister
BEHOLD MY ULTIMATE TECHNIQUE

00,10ewwwww salt and watermellon

OMNOMNOM

Oh she does have a nose
Sumica: sounds like a form of torture
Hot sauce and watermelon is great also.
cakes of rice drizzled in caramel
/me murders Midnight_Splendor
its nonexistent looking straight at her
Salt on watermelon is delicious
how about salty ice cream
:P
sesalt ice cream?
thelonepony|school: you mean sea salt icecream?
salty and sweet together? blasphemy!
yes
i want to try it so badly
Theres a recpie for that if I remember
damn i havent played that game in a while >.<
Why did they leave a 4-6 year old at home by herself?
BECAUSE ANIME
AttackWithHugs: Japan

blah-blah-blah Tai is full of pride........oh, i remember this episode, and he has his nose back!
would you guys rather have a digimon or a personal robot partner, like in Medabots
KARI
STAHP
Turns out all od this is a REALLY bad acid trip
Deacon|EVTrain: id rather have a medabot
Never watched Medibots
djblazekin: you'll probably get used to it
*medabots
SpadeKyurem: it is pretty fun
*Medabots
And Ogremon waits for the walking signal.
whats up with this music xD
Never seen Medabots either

MaxTheBrony: i think they took lessons from evangelion
PROPERTY DAMAGE
Did digimon rip off evangelion?
ahu
:C
and pokemon at the same time?
CASUALTIES
:<
and yugioh season 0?
Bronysith: that depends on which came first.
man, it's been awhile since I seen medabots, all I remember is metabee and that silver robot
OH GOD WHAT NOW
Dark92Enigma: evangelion
Bronysith: OMG
Oh
SpadeKyurem: have you seen yugioh season 0? it is really quite good
he evolves to the dinosaur?

Bronysith: Screw the rules I have green hair kaiba?

08,01Sumica: that is not a hare guest wing
i dont know any of these stupid kids names
other than tai
Espectially the animation...
Bronysith: whatever, in japan, animes and mangas tend to share plots/character traits, ect
yugioh season 0 is the best and only good yugioh shit
...Now why they didn't use it for the later episodes...Ah well...
I stopped watching Pokemon after the johto saga
Bronysith: Sora, Mimi, Matt....other than that, i don't
i wish
:P
It got bullshit and bull in the hoenn saga and onwards
YOU'VE VIOLATED THE LAW!

Yay! Venture Bros!

I found one interesting glitch if thats what it is in skyrim

Bronysith: All the main ones.

where'd the whole scootaloo being a chiken thing come from
from the stare master
sorry for the slow response. I am bypassing the school firewall with my ipod
bye...
beeeeeeweeeeou
seeya sonicdude558!
she hovered she is getting close to learn how to fly and chikens dont fly
djblazekin, in the episode "The Stare Master", the CMC were searching for Flutteshy's chicken who wandered into the Everfree Forest. Scootaloo changed her mind about the search partway through, and Applebloom, offended by the notion, called her a chicken. Applebloom then proceeded to change her call from "Here, chick chick chick" to "Scootaloo! Scoot-Scootaloo!"

Man I fucking love Black 2
Bronysith: The mods are in the mod tab
11,02Tuition is only 5 easy monthly payments of $4,999.95, that's just pennies a day.
10000000 pennies a day
Yay :3
But....I can't afford that!
whats the prize usually for the lotto
I want to speak to the Financial Aid!
25k per semester?
woo!
I have five bucks
If memory serves right, this Friday's movies are Gladiator and some foreign animated movie called George the Hedgehog.
I'm studying for tomorrow exam from philosophy
SuperBrony64: I can afford that, I just won't eat lunch for two days.
Is that enough?
AttackWithHugs: That'll cost ya...
but, that means i have to work in El Pollo loco again ;3;
11,02djblazekin: Your selection gets featured at Brony Movie Night :)
Mars Attacks is B
Petrified_Discord, well I can't get a grant XD
Mars Attacks?! FUCK YEAH!!!\
It's kinda hard for me to remember all the philosophy stuff
I still lol how Neil acted the next day
thats cool
11,02Everlasting_Joy: Two days? LE HORROR

Or some mushrooms
HoodEevee|Skool: OH U :D

AttackWithHugs: Be nice.
round 3 again
djblazekin: Stop. Sucking.
SuperBrony64: can you guys post the nomination table every week along with the actual winners? sometimes thats the only way to know if our selections are eligible in the first place.
Besides, I'k glad that George the Hedgehog got cut. I looked up the trailer, and it was uglier than my grandmother's ass.
...why were you looking at your grandmother's ass in the first place?
^
Unless you're assisting her?
If George DID get streamed, I think it would get become C-rank in a heartbeat.
have*
C rank?
It would be black listed
Stank rank
fuck i got cornered and downed twice couldn't rebuy quick revive
ohai twilight_sprinkl|afk :3
C-rank movies are below B-rank movies. They are played once and never played again because they are so bad.
To never watch again
twilight_sprinkl|afk: No, gtfo or chang your nick, tis pokehour
basically, WMC'ed
goodluck on it :)
George the Hedgehog would be a C-rank if it were streamed here.
Pokehour? Then I don't have to change anything! XD
George the hedgehog sounds like Sonic's retarded cousin
*does
Kandarihu: Wait, its about hedgehogs and nudity?
Who recomended a furry movie?
I can no inglish
:D
Alchemist: No, I'm pretty sure that's B-grade because it's still fun to watch for shits and giggles.
thx :)
That's too funny
Alchemist: It has been shown and it hasn't been WMCed.
SuperBrony64: Dude, guess what?
Last time I checked, hedgehogs don't wear clothing
NO, SONIC AND CO DOESN'T COUNT
Sexual nudity
HoodEevee|Skool: Oh it's Pokemon hour? LEt me think of am appropriate nick
You know what I meant
Any kind f sex act will render a nomination null and void??
^
HoodEevee|Skool, I only know what I heard here. But the omission of this movie is seen by some as overly oppressive censorship.
Any kind of explicit sex act, anyway.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R8GVUdc9xs Gotta escape fromt eh city
Hi all!
So that means The Room won't be shown anymore.
Gustav: Oi
dammit, I have to change my a movie vote then... :(
Hi Gustav
I saw some of George the Hedgehog, and I think that cutting it was a good choice.
I thought it got WMC
Hai Gustav :)
Ah, nevermind
Hi! This is my first time here! Can anypony explain anything to me?
George's sex scenes are disgusting and vile, much like the rest of the film.
I fucking love City Escape
SpadeKyurem, why escape when you can face your fears http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnUgeEGstDU

There!
SHIZUKA!!!
pssst

City Escape is overrated
No, really, over there! In the ball pit!
Also guards in skyrim have been claling me snek thef
CrystalPhoenix would you prefer speed highway?
/me nuzzles Shizuka's cheek.
Live and Learn is still the best Sonic Final boss song Open Your heart is a close second
SpadeKyurem: you've been stealing. Good, Good.
for one I preffer this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxftbJx_JUE
MadSurge: Madchamp?
But seriously, I hope I get B-movie select for next week. I got a good one planned.
but seriously there is definitely more songs that can par City escape if not best http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptAPujlGcB0
Shizuka: whos lying?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrY5Jwk8gY4 Best Sonic Boss song ever
13they think there is a shizu here
Hello Shizuka :)
But I saw her ;`;
SpadeKyurem, remove your nostalgia goggles
SpadeKyurem: /) agreement
how've you been Shizuka
Oh well, I guess it was just my imagination
But there IS a Shizu here. Right there! *points at Shizuka*
HoodEevee|Skool: or MadSnivy :P
Bronysith: (\
There is a Shizu here :D
I love all the sonic music tracks but Live and Learn is still the best in my opinion
MadSurge: I thought we were sticking to 1st gen, but that could work
round 4 this time
I remember when I said live and learn was the best when I was a teenager
Oh shit, gtg
HoodEevee|Skool: I know little of Pokemon, let me work with what I know :D
Latas
Plz
right now it's really meh
MadSurge: Go ahead
Bye HoodEevee|Skool
seeya HoodEevee|Skool
SpadeKyurem: i just think that the music fits the fight, like it could work with any high action epic boss battle, but couldnt work in a JRPG final boss fight, know what i mean?
bye HoodEevee|Skool :)
damn it
:I
Hey thelonecubone|School!
wut?
SpadeKyurem: it is meant for hot blooded boss fights, that is why it fits the final boss fight for sonic adventure 2 battle perfectly
/me smacks thelonecubone|School with a ruler on his hoof "TOO SLOW"

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbndyrUQkEc I like I am all of me too
Howdy thelonecubone|School!

Why are the youtube links always sanic
Howdy AttackWithHugs!

Best sonic songs are always from the worse sonic games http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRe3h1iQ1Os
thelonecubone|School: unfortunately i cant fill your chat box with it :<
twilight_squirtle: lol
CrystalPhoenix: Sonic music is always great regardless the game imo

you try to hard sprunkls
plsz
Anyone here knows what hour is it in Oregon?
sprunkls, pls
Oregon?
I fucking love the zebra head mix of His World

MadSurge, your santee?

Shizuka: I'd imagine. Plus, it exploded right afterwards.
you can try all you want sprunkls, but i wont be ,ad :3
mad*
13you could probably tell that you can't control those vehicles at all
The Shizubus. Preferred method of transportation to BronyState University
And I already am mad! :D
MadSurge, d'awwwww~
/me slaps twilight_squirtle around a bit with a Large chancla :3
13bus has it a little easier as when it lands on its side it doesn't make wheel contact, but turning the wheels does
Shizuka: Yeah, not if they're flipping around like a cartridge-tilted Goldeneye character.
13so as long as it's on its side you have a small amount of control but not much
MadSurge, but right now it's 12:06 pm in Oregon iirc
damn

can this woman get even more stereotypical? :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q903THPgAM
CrystalPhoenix: wait seriously?
BEHOLD: THE CENTER OF YOUTUBE!! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ5LpwO-An4
and yeah you can only love the game now with nostalgia goggles
MadSurge, hmm. Might wanna take a look at the world clock to be sure
Bronysith: I dont :(
Hi ^^
i dont like the idea of playing through a game twice
What do you mean?
Bronysith, http://youtu.be/7l5tybm2LDE?t=2m37s
Bronysith: even if the game has multiple 2paths"?
AttackWithHugs: they also sent back the previous one because they had the address but not the name :|
well i'll play trough a good game twice :D
Bronysith: I've done it before. Many times, in fact. It's actually rather fun.
Bronysith then you'll absolutely love shadow the hedgehog, where you have to replay the game so many times to unlock the last story
OPPAN GANGNAM STYLE
15 times
Deacombee|EVTrain: fuck that XD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0
AttackWithHugs: I got the money back at least. And now they got the name, so they better not screw up again! :[
I stopped counting how many times I've played thourh Albion and Xcom1-2
but wait oyu can unlock over 600 possible story paths!
SpadeKyurem: fuck that
SpadeKyurem they're all the same with little to no difference
Bronysith: One path is called the power of love
fuck that
THIS IS WHO I AM!
wait, like power in love from sailor moon?
that awesome song?
This is who I am can be a meme
OPPAN GANGNAM STYLE!! OP! OP! OP! OPPAN GANGNAM STYLE!
You say I am Shadow the hedgehog, and end with this is who I am
Instant meme
SpadeKyurem: dont force it
round 5 kino
with ray gun and bough all 3 qr
You gotta beliiiiiiiiiiiieve in the power of love
The more the merrier!
i think kefka and sephiroth are some of my fav final boss fights and charcters of all time
i dont know
Shadow the hedgehog has the most pointless moral choice system ever
I like Golbez, he's the darth vader of the final fantasy series
Nothing you do matters
yup
Help black doom, his troops still attack you
And then he gets pissyw hen you kill said troops
SpadeKyurem: that
that game sucks,
I think the greatest villain of all is.... MANKIND
end of story
i give up on zombies
If you want me to not kill your troops tell them to stop attacking me moron
jcelios the wrestler?
Also the Egg Dealer is the most retarded boss ever
no the anime char
Why would Robotnik program his mech to shoot himself
SpadeKyurem: you know
SpadeKyurem: you know what they say
gtg
THE MORE THE MERRIER
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY, THE MORE THE MERRIER
There one plot hole in Shadow I dont get
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY, THE MORE THE MERRIER
In one path he fires the ARK's laser
wait what do they say?
game of the year, every year http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neFdVIK5xac
wasnt the ark unoperation after SA2?
SpadeKyurem it's for the shadow androids, plus it depends who has the last hit, eggman or shadow
Deacombee|EVTrain: still retarded
Alchemist: it was just released this year
Dont put the damn buttons where shadow can hit them
Bronysith: dont matter
Bronysith: and I was being sarcastic :)
I never really understood why the ARK worked in Shadow
Im pretty sure it stopped working after the Final Hazard fight
SA2B is best 3d sonic game
shadow the hedgehog sucks
get over it
I know that...
Tbh I like how shadow was handled in Heroes
heroes was underrated
It was left ambigous if he was the real shadow or a robot
sonic heroes that is
I liked that
But my god Heroes was shiny as fuck
Scootaflew d'aww
Scootaflew: her face and position is really really...no
Bronysith: But wasn't that how she appeared in the episode?
yea
it is really suggestive though
Still...
O.o
it's only suggestive to the dirty mind.....
What you guys talking bout?
no idea
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODKaVpMYZfg Love this
stream down. =(
Listening to anime music right now. <3
Anime music is best music.
Bronysith: Found a better one, but not scoots D: http://forum.yugiohcardmaker.net/uploads/profile/photo-72432.gif?_r=1354404625
And JAM Project is best band.
Scootaflew: HNNNNGG
Scootaflew: you see, sweetie belles position and facial expression wasnt suggestive
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo4kwf5jBQ4 Go go metal sonic!
NOW LISTENING TO: Fire Wars by JAM Project (theme to Mazinkaiser)
A very badass song
dance party?
my friend had an idea for a sonic game that involved time travel, going back to feudal japan (because he says that's where sonic is from), with eggman kidnapping his ancestry for some reason
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=950j9Kxiwic
Also the riverwood shop owner is down a sister
Guess how
and a whopping 24+ levels
going back to feudal japan because that's where sonic is from
what
OOH!!
Sounds like the next sly cooper
NOW LISTENING TO: It's Love by RABBIT (theme of Ranma 1/2 The Movie)
and I didn;t say anything, but I really don't like that idea
/me loves Ranma 1/2.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CatAO-Kt5Wo I love this fan game's sound track
i do to
/me also loves the theme to the Ranma 1/2 movie.
awesome show.
I used to see the trailer for Ranma 1/2 The Movie on almost every single Pokemon VHS I saw as a kid. I could never get the song out of my head.
I love how you can remove Virgin Media's block on Pirate Bay by adding one line to your hosts file.
Just goes to show how pointless the block was.
Virgin media?
UK ISP
anyone here like shadow of the colossus?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2N5XWD2DQDk
Although I'm baffled as to exactly why VIZ put the trailer for a series as sexual as Ranma 1/2 on Pokemon tapes...
Though the Ranma 1/2 Movie is actually rather tame in comparison to everything else in the franchise...
Your isp was blocking pirate bay?
Ohai

lali-ho aniderp|bestcakeever!
Paladin is best class :3
Horde is beat facion
SpadeKyurem why yes it is
Faction*
Not right now eman
horde is ONLY faction
I hate Garrosh
Once Thrall goes back I'll be good
SpadeKyurem: you mean shinji?
Also Chen Stormstout is best Pandaren
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/dd55486eddaf30f12f059350cf47f755.jpg AttackWithHugs: Prankster, prankster Pinkie Pie! :D
:D
MadSurge: That Pinkie Pie!
Ohau Nittany_Discord
Mists of Pandaria more than make sup for the slight disapointment Catacylsm was
SpadeKyurem: cata was slightly disapointing?
slightly?
Bronysith: To me
only slightly though?
Eh
I didnt really like DS if anything
wrath of the lich king was awesome and burning crusade...
orgasmic
You know what else is a slight disappointment?
Bronysith: God the hellreaver
That was hell
MY MOM!
SpadeKyurem: remember the first time you walked through the gates?
Bronysith: I was flabbergasted
SO many demons
Applejack has gone full apple...
true
SpadeKyurem: i didnt even immediately walk through the dark gates, i just stood there marveling at it, a little scared to go through, and then walked in to a whole new world
and holy fuck
so overwhelming
I feel kinda pathetic I never joined a guild or did a raid till I was lvl 80
I still havent cleared a Cata raid besides DS and most of FL
SpadeKyurem: my guild was top on the horde side of our server, it was awesome
Derpy is a successful business owner http://i.imgur.com/DJITr.png
SpadeKyurem: and when i first got shadowmourne, holy fuck
Scootaflew, well there goes my heart
Most the horde seems like a bunch of assholes so I prefure the Alliance
SpadeKyurem: my guild was awesome though
SpadeKyurem, it's either the snoby prick or the uncouth jerks
choose your poison
The Alliance seems more likeable than the horde
CrystalPhoenix: do you mean the alliance? the faction for 12 year olds
Bronysith: Hey!
:(
Bronysith, I just associate both Alliance and Horde
SpadeKyurem: on my server the horde were nice people
also the faction community depends on servers
My guild is full of nice people
and i mostly stuck with my aweosme guild, i actually hang with some of them in real life
But god help you going on trade
in some it's the Horde that are nice
in others it's Alliance
Bronysith: remember Barrens chat?
SpadeKyurem: my guild leader was actually in the some state as me and she is really awesome
welp, bbl I guess, kinda busy
SpadeKyurem: hehe
SpadeKyurem: thats why i sped through that area for leveling XD
Never ask derpy about her bubbles http://i.imgur.com/2nzl1.jpg
Scootaflew: dat gore
Scootaflew: why
Scootaflew: have fun getting kicked
D;
Scootaflew my poor eyes can't handle all that gore >.>
Imo I think Blizzard made the loot system worse in pandaria for raids
gore!?
:o
15% for any loot same for using a coin, more or less you just get fucking gold
Bronysith, I'm sorry but that's not gore
CrystalPhoenix: it is still not appropriate for chat
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/efcfbbb6e839646e60aa3db5a3748092.png The Paperbag Mare! :D
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtUpWihJJJ4
Bronysith, that can be arguable really
Also the game can be a dick to you and give you the same gear twice
have some Evabridged
I dont know about anyone else but I liked having a confimed chance of getting any gear instead of a slim chance
SpadeKyurem: take the bitching to blizzard
like they give a fuck
I still say 1000000 is way too many lesser charms to have at once
GTG. Bye everypony~

That was sort of the POINT.
Holla everypony! :)

It looks rather boring
/me glomps and licks GilDash|Busy
Well excuuuuse me princess
Ron Weasley will save you!
Hi GilDash|Busy
ron weasely is the shinji ikari of the harry potter universe
Shinji is worse
He does not go fast.
Hai guys
Gotta go fast
and of course shadow was a cool character...then they made him into a shinji
WHY?!
how are things Linderman
WHY RUIN A COOL CHARACTER
Atexxm Sweet, you?
hi again guys :)
The hell is a shinji
A waffle
Yes, a few hours ago that was me
...Shadow was a cool character?
Well, okay, he was acceptable in SA2.
Shadow was filler!
Lasharus: exactly
Damn. Not here
heya sonicdude558 :)
I liked Shadow
s ago
oops
Every game since, however...
i'm good Linderman
Lasharus: but they ruined him in shadow the hedgehog by making hima WHINING EMO BITCH
damn distracting ponies
I has work to do!
"I've got amnesia" What, AGAIN!? Could you bloody well write a DIARY or something?
I kind of liked how Shadow was handled in Heroes
SpadeKyurem: you already said that
They left his real fate ambiguous
you already said that
today
Wheres that DAMN 4th Chaos Emerald?
And they left his characteristics uninteresting.
"Maria?" Oh shut up.
Still more interesting than Silver
There I'll agree with you.
I really like Blaze as a character though
If only because Silver's one of the most preposterously idiotically written characters in the series. Thank you, Sonic 2006. You sick, stupid, moronic game.
Sonic, knuckles, and tails are the only tolerable characters
except current sonic
HE SUCKS
Bronysith: DOCTOR ROBOTNIK!
Bronysith: Da hell
SpadeKyurem: i like old sonic cause current one wont shut the fuck up
Current Sonic is mildly acceptable now that they replaced his Voice Actor, Bronysith. :P
Now at least he can act being intolerable.
Look. Its Sumida! The evil version.
Oh jesus..whine whine
He makes you watch streams on dail up.
D=
Ghehehehehe.
But yeah Bronysith, you can't excluse Dr. Robotnik from the lineup of good Sonic characters.
The series would've been rather pointless without him. :P
Lasharus: you know what they say
the more the merrier
The more the m- *SHOT*
you know what they say, the more the merrier
Yes, he had his awful moments too :P
you know what they say, the more the merrier
But Colours was genius.

AJIsAwesome: Best Santa :3
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Il4VAYYTk0 This is the best glitch of all
first time skyrim was released, it was so inefficiently programmed that some guy made a patch that gae 40% performance boost. bethesda did that too in one of their own patches later
>MFW update on Sonic & all star racing transformed
YES FINALLY
when was the update up for the US?
AJIsAwesome: dawwwww

OMG THIS UPDATE IS GLORIOUS
CrystalPhoenix: Not to hold anytthing against you but you said Sticker star had no story right?
http://i.imgur.com/59Djl.jpg
SpadeKyurem, what are you going to bring in now
well while you guys overslept, this was pretty much me today during the exam http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120804223737/mlp/images/1/12/Twilight_Sparkle_with_a_bird's_nest_on_her_head_S2E03.png
AJIsAwesome: the other tires herself with sick wing tricks :D
Not sure if this is legit but in a Interview Miamoto said he wanted it to have a simple story, not sure if thats true
twilight_squirtle: ._.
SpadeKyurem, that is possible but still I hate that decision of his
cause it removes the charm of Paper Mario
Not sure why he wanted a simple story
He said he didnt want any origonal characters either...seems legit
hmmm
mount and blade looks fun
yeah basically he said that he didn't wanted to make a Paper Mario
are we talking about dissapointment of the series?
AJIsAwesome: owaw, im not the only one running vista

Personally If I didnt have the prima guide I would have died alot to the bosses
was the point of drummer boys in the wars?
thelonecubone: yay kittehs

Wow, I think this is the longest that we have gone on Bronystate where we have not had a stream.
Oh, thanks otakon and Michael|studying. :)
oi otakon i am going to do something that you are expecting
otakon: Streaming stuff can be tiring. I don't blame the mods.
lez watch phoenux wrong
i can already say that chat will be nothing but "MURRICA" during mars attack
twilight_squirtle: ?
It would be cool if they streamed the chat, then we could see ourselves on the screen :O, it would be glorious!
Socks: it would crash the site
why havent the lottery winners been posted on the front page yet?
twilight_squirtle: nah
OH
/me sits on otakon
AJIsAwesome: werent you around for that movie with the us president on the plane?
Socks: Sheepgoesmeep, is that you?
otakon: DO IT ANYWAY!
Bronysith: I'm guessing because they're sill working on it?
I'm ashamed to live in a country full of idiots and morons who can't run a country properly
it'd be like dividing by zero :)
SpadeKyurem: dude, that's most places you know
*still
hello
NO ONE KNOWS WHAT THE FUCK THEY'RE DOING
twilight_squirtle: Not really.
I'm australian we have the worst prime minster at the moment
oi otakon is persona 4 any less grindy?
Socks: You act almost exactly like my friend who goes by that name.
Bronysith: it's a bit less grindy, or at least it's more grind friendly
:D Perhaps I am your friend, It's just I went back in time to meet you :O
otakon: the grind ruins persona 3
God forbid we take care of our own lifes
:O
SpadeKyurem: oh yeah, like MITT "All for the rich" Romney is any better...
AJIsAwesome: well even during that movie, chat was nothing but "MURRICA MURRICA"
so, anyone?
twilight_squirtle: That's understandable.
I don't own it
I got a great choice for B movie next week. But I'm gonna keep it a secret until the day the lotto is announced.
SpadeKyurem: but you don't hate obama cause hes black right....its beacause of his veiws right:'(
No? okay
also, Filies in hoody pajama's are TOO GODDAMN CUTE
SpadeKyurem: its not the worst government out there. at least you can actually choose, whereas in countries like russia you dont even get a say in the matter
Oh dont play the god damn racisim card
Our country is lead by David "Made in a sawmill" Cameron and supposedly co ran by Nick "Wat a Wet" Clegg :/
AJIsAwesome: understandable but its dumb
twilight_squirtle: Agreed.
NO MORE POLITICS...THE END

People always play the racist card as and excuse
*UCK YEAH

Shizuka: ?
Shizuka: like, one
i was only in bronymusic once that one time with the whole war thing
Shizuka: What's going on in bronymusic?
13cause i'm sorely tempted to insert an extban that locks out anyone who's in that channel from joining here
:D I lol at other pony's non-understanding :D
whats bronymusic? a channel here?
Shizuka: after that incident? go for it

13a channel harboring trolls
0,5Do et
do it then
Shizuka: So...4chan?
hehe
What's this Shizuka?
13that's why i'm asking, anyone who's in #bronymusic would be effectively banned here
yeah bad idea I think
Shizuka: never heard of the place
hey guys

13at least wouldn't be able to speak and wouldn't be able to rejoin after leaving

13otakon: am
good :)
havent heard about it
If thats possible
Shizuka: i thought there were only 2-3 of the trolls there, wouldnt it be easier to just ban them?
Shizuka: I don't think that's a good idea. I can see some people who are in bronymusic and here at the same time not being a troll.
JarlBaconTheGreater: Can I be thy court wizard, my jarl?
SpadeKyurem: she's waiting to confer with the other mods
0,5As another mod I support it so far :P

Shizuka: bronymusic mods said that rumor was false though, i asked them that time
I only know one person from bronymusic who doesn't know about bstate but he's harmless
Mlp
dazzle
me
What is BronyMusic?
twilight_squirtle: while one of them actively trolled us. maybe he was a rouge, but whatever
a channel
another channel, Socks
Crush 40 always does good music
Socks: Channel.
harboring trolls
0,5Yeah screw 'em
:O
Socks presumbly music done by bronies
i can see some trolls, impersonators, etc
Shizuka: all i know is that gunny /started/ the incident
JarlBaconTheGreater: Can I be thy.... uh... butler?
I still say its being mean to the innocents
^
Shizuka: They say they want a revolutioooooon
Yeah, Internet newb here, You're gonna have to explain what you mean by "CHannel" another chat?
0,5VIVE LE REVELECIEN
I dont think every single one of them deserves to be banned
Dark92Enigma: Spartans againsted Romans or whatever hm?
Socks: Pretty much.
twilight_squirtle: and hes an OP? huh
Ok :)
And then channel wars
13http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/rfc/rfc.html
da hell is this
Death?
Dark92Enigma: LEt's Give them One :D
By JINGO!
SpadeKyurem: THE VOID
Arent we being a little extreme here?
13in any event, trying to start conflicts with other channels is against network rules
/me starwars theme plays
I'm pretty sure that not all of the people in bronymusic should be banned from coming here. That's kind of like banning people here that don't talk and only lurk.
ah
13so for the three of you that live in bronymusic, you'd better tell them to get a handle on their users
/me protects otakon from the nuclear option
I'm okay
Shizuka: Good point, but surely if only a few of them do, then wouldn't it be unfair to ban the peaceful fellows of Broymusic?
I have a bunker
twilight_squirtle: the guy that Shizuka wound up banning at first was one of the OPs.
... "with tonberries"
AND MY SHIELD!
AND MY AXE
I feel like a little child first realising that there are different countries
otakon: i have tonberries
an entire army of the fuckers
13BlazeAngel: true, but they'd better have a handle on their users then
yikes
Bronysith: I could kill those things easy
Shizuka: Ah.
otakon: not even a nuclear bomb can kill them
um
13again, trying to start fights with other channels is against network rules, this would be nipping it in the bud
SpadeKyurem: without knights of the round?
Shizuka: we're locked and loaded......
should we go tell them?
if they can't handle their own users, then they shall be punished...
I mean should someone go tell them what's going on?
otakon: Maybe they can find out on their own.
ahh is it just me or is it getting a little...morbid in here/
otakon: I think that's a pretty good idea.
otakon: we didnt tell hiroshima, or nagasaki
*?
otakon: the mods can handle that
I mean hell, we don't even get this much grief from #brony
God help you if you ran alot in ff6 and finds a stepmaster
/me grabs his spoon "I shall need this if we're going into battle!" :P
Shizuka: (i'm on THIS channel's side by the way, the mane chat)
SpadeKyurem: O_o
otakon: we never had anything against that channel
Socks: We aren't. Not unless epcified.
specified*
LET ME AT EM!
Shizuka: i can try talking to them again aftr wednesday
:P, me joking
Socks: No. :3
Those fuckers do damage for how long you took steps so you can be easily wrecked
/me holds Socks back :3
some ancient users still hang out there
G'night everypony! :)
its getting scary in here:'(
Night GilDash|Busy :)
Goodnight GilDash|Busy :)
Gnight GilDash|Busy
Night, GilDash|Busy. :)
SpadeKyurem: and in ff7 they do the amount of damage depending on how many things youve killed
/me reads what Shizuka recently posted. *yes, sir, ma'am sir*
They will taste my steel!
13had i known about channelbanning at the start of the year we probably would have locked out #brony for all the trouble they caused us
Night GilDash|Busy
Shizuka: That was bad.
Bronysith: The ultimate anti grinder
Shizuka: eeyup
ff6 is the best ff game
Shizuka: effectively banning Rain, niiiiiice
FOR THE ALLIANCE!
What happened with "brony"?
13nuclear options aren't fun
Artifact: i tied it with final fantasy 7
SpadeKyurem: No. :3
Shizuka: or that
sometimes the end must come
Bronysith:My top 3 are ff1 ff2 ff6
and it must come with a thunderous finish
Buytoast: And somtimes, we must not worry.
13there's a double symbolism with channelbanning being the nuclear option
13it's the option you never want to use
13the threat of it should be sufficient
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq9YM2xg7xg Fitting music? Maybe?
Hm.

Michael|studying: good night
Socks: I'm sorry, you're going to die.
wheres MakerDusk when you need him
I have no clue what's going on besides talk of banning a channel. But that's because I live in only 3 channels, two of which I'm active in
O.O
NOOOO!

Socks: Wait, I was mistaken.
Shizuka: ?

AJIsAwesome: Hush. This be important.
13basically they run the servers
RUN! WOMEN AND PEOPLE CALLED SOCKS FIRST!
AJIsAwesome: there is talk of channel banning, basically the equivalent of NUKING a channel
J_E_Smith71, TLDR they're the big guns
Socks, I dun think so
otakon: ......
13but wait... revere would have said "the british regulars are coming"
Socks: you're not people, you're socks.

Shizuka: RUUUN. RUUUN. I AM COMING FOR YOU.
otakon: change your pants
Shizuka: I CAN'T! I AM A REGULAR! (not a mod, but i am!)

13SpadeKyurem: and even then it would be the regulars
RUN! THE ENIGMA IS COMING!

Shizuka: ....is the chat in trouble?

Hello IRCops, you look funny :)

Socks: Are you demented? HUSH.
Shizuka: the redcoats r comin? 6_9
13but anyway before yall start spreading fud, we've had a handful of trolls stumble in from #bronymusic that seem happy to evade bans in order to troll us, so if they don't cut it out we'll have to lock out the channel
some of the ircops smell funny
lol
Shizuka: so why hasnt he arrived exactly?
but thats neither here nor there :)
13what if..
13HE'S ALREADY HERE

Seeing how he's logged in here, I'm pretty sure he is here.
Do we all go blah blah blah at Bronymusic now?
Shizuka: do you mean....
Shizuka: Do I need to register my name to not get locked?
dawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww

I say we send them Kerbal world
>Shizuka going mad
Pfft
Bronysith: Or like the Genie, Rubbing the lamp ;)
13i'd rather not use the nuclear option, i think we could be better served klining people that go around spamming PM but that's up to the ircops
13>going
Dark92Enigma: thats a good point but it could be A HER
I blme sxyprtndr 4 brnymuzeck

We're going to love and toleratr the fuck out of them!
Shizuka: Are you friends with the men in white coats?
UP THE LCL COMPRESSION LEVELS
otakon: up the lcl compression
NO!
Socks: a troll channel named #bronymusic started sending trolls at us.
13they're nice men, they have happy pills
Ok you went more insane, big deal I still don't know what's happening.
Shizuka: hi
Dark92Enigma: no. they arent a troll channel. you are mistaken. the channel just so happens to harbor trolls
/me boards the Shizubus
/me increases the LCL fluid compression in Shizuka s EVA-02 by 10000000 points

Bronysith: no it's a single player RPG
otakon: or is it going to be baldurs gatey? i dont like baldurs gate T~T
otakon: wait, the New RPG game?
Oi Shizuka, I have a question.
SpadeKyurem: WE NEED.........SUMERPAN.

otakon: looks awesome, but since it lacks multiplayer, the game is going to receive super low scores T~T
Bronysith: I know -_-
otakon: cause you know, multiplayer=quality
BULLSHIT!
hi
otakon: honestly i think skyrim shouldve gotten a 10 from gameinformer, i mean mass effect 3 got a 10 for no good reason other than it had multiplayer
0,5SRS BSNS

JarlBaconTheGreater: YOU HAVE FAILED JARL!
otakon: i feel that skyrim is the better game than mass effect cause it has longevity in single player...well it is only single player, but mass effect 3s multiplayer actually feels well done
Rainfall_Night: um not really
JarlBaconTheGreater: thats my procrastinating boy! ^_^
Bronysith: true but the ending :(
LC, just dont turn into Gaben, k?
SuperBrony64: did you pick up the final issue of Nintendo Power yet?
otakon: "the most perfect ending to any game ever" goddamnit informer
Bronysith: bullshit on a stick
otakon: i was laughing and /)_- when i read that
+BlazeAngel the last thing she said was : and with that i have to go plow the driveway again since we got another foot of snow overnight and the road plows made a mountain at the end

twilight_squirtle: I mean I've been BONING her for years...

SpadeKyurem: um sir, still a bit of a legal issue there

SuperBrony64: oh
SuperBrony64: it's out over here
Yeah, I'm from #bronymusic as well, and I'm curious.
only 2 games I am awaiting next year, SR:R and SRO :)
NeX-x: Oh, your here
Yeah.
me too
And u.
Welcome
ohai
I'm trying to get the logs
Twinkies!
i would remember one of their names if i were to see it
Oh, yeah, no problem.
gotta go, be right back
I heard there were trolls...?
Kill the trolls with fire
naw let's not
:>
just a question
Are we the only ones that don't kill trolls with fire?
burning trolls smell bad
ask away
at least we have something to ook at while we are off air
feed the trolls til they asplode
haha
and kicked
did any of the trolls spam any of you with 'swag' or something like that in private message?
however their tears are sweet nectar :)
because if so I know who he is
Whoa whoa whoa, since when is bold a color?
Somasis: Swaglestia
yeah, him
NeX-x: you can't use colors unless you're a mod, bold is white.
Somasis: hate hi,
him*
and he's not from #bronymusic, he just does that spam thing there too
Seriously?
uh
lol
he seems to do it more often there though
thats odd
hmm
I'm not sure though
wait, white color isnt allowed? D:
I haven't been in here in a while
das raisin!
and we're all rule breakers too then
dats wasist!
twilight_squirtle: bold is considered white
Somasis: No?
:p
BlazeAngel, no about what?
otakon: but all our text is white
Somasis: sometimes he goes as Babseed and someother name. can't remember
Somasis: Haven't been here ina while
Every color is white on my end that doesn't reference me or staff abuse.
hh
What's going on now?
yeah, he was in #bronystate as CutieMare some hours ago
I asked aji to kline him
:3
NeX-x: well apparently bold counts as color
hey Derpy_Hooves
fail
huh, i thought cutiemare was swagestia
that fail
Somasis: ah, so thats his no alias
he was, twilight_squirtle
also
new*
no, U fail :)
ah ok Somasis
thelonecubone, he seems to use many different ones
Somasis: ikr
he does all the time
Better than the GNAA.
basically just look for anyone that ends up with "ri.ri.cox.net" on the end of their host, and then pony_(numbers) as his ident and doesn't talk or anything
hehe cox
his last whois gave me this: * [CutieMare] (pony_45768@jy65-3-357-38.ri.ri.cox.net): https://ponychat.net/
Oi, my buttons on the bottom failed, I can't change channels.
so yeah, look for host similar to that and you'll know who to get rid of
*hostss
gah, *hosts
It's the control code that that's the focus of the kick script.
Thank you fellow
no problem
Sorry for bothering you.
it's fine
We're sure it's that one guy, right?
Well...
from what I'm hearing, it is
there may be more, I dunno
if there is I probably don't know who they are
BlazeAngel: werent you about to pop up some logs?
I cannot get to them.
ah
rev up those logs!
Shizu hd them I think
had*
Shizu...
what?
Shizuka.
Oh.
It got quiet here.
Oh, never mind, I thought it was a guy that also collects NES games.
I have had a go at that guy many times in PM about it and his reasoning was that he is an attention whore :|
ttention whore?
Attention whore?
tension whore?
Oh no.
0,5Whor? >_>
He's doing it wrong.
People looking for people to pay atttention to them
^
Ahhh.
00,02my laptop appears to have woken itself from hibernate
hiya Phase4
Hi Phase4.
Well, I think we know what an attention whore is.
00,02this is most confusing
Phase4: But it isn't spring yet?
:3
Phase4: mine did that all the time
00,02MLP_Brovakiin, exactly
Phase4: Skynet?
for a EX. Bugging someone like you, BlazeAngel like for the past 10 min. non stop
00,02Alchemist, possibly
00,02also hi everyone
Hai Phase4 :)
Hi Phase4 :)
Phase4, MLP_Brovakiin, winter wrap up? :)
Sure?
Say NeX, whenever we may see this guy, we will do something. Sorry for thinking it was you. But there was more than one. That is the problem.
Hey chat.
I didn't think that it was me.
hey Nittany_Discord
Hi Nittany
HI Nittany_Discord :)
I'm just known as the troll in my end. The bad one.
Anyway, I'm off.
Oh dear
Bye, have a good one
sup Nittany_Discord
Thanks and keep us updated.
Bye NeX-x :)
we will
Sure
hiya Nittany_Discord long time no see man :)
/me hugs Nittany_Discord
Dark92Enigma yeah apprently they are making the bret hart dvd
Heya Nittany_Discord :)
Nittany, you came in at a inopertune time, but How are you?
I'm OK.
:3
Nittany_Discord: okay is good :)
There was an issue with bronymusic, but it turns out it most likely isn't them.
So all is good. :3
BlazeAngel: so far
Oh boy.
Yeeeah.
Hope it was SFW.
Well.
Ish.
Nittany_Discord: he dreamt he kissed you
which is odd
since, well he doesn't even know what you look like
>;l
Well, you can dream of people even if you've never seen them. You just imagine what they look like.
yar
Well, I've had enough talking about problems for one day. So can we discuss silly things now? :)
I WANT OCTAVIA SPEAKING ROLE!
and it better be gooooood
Well.
that's a terrible idea
horrible even
Sure is boring around here
BlazeAngel: could i Nom on you + hat :3
I imagine it will be Tar Strong who does, even if that happens.
Anyone feel like streaming
And only if you leave half
no idea

how does a scanning tunneling electron microscope work?

mm sweet cider... yeah sweet cider
jcelios: with its monkey
QUESTION: Why is Twilight Purple?
i'm cursed i'm telling ya. CURSED!
does the monkey need to be calibrated?
in the script
StinkomanFan: it is in the script
StinkomanFan because reasons
StinkomanFan, because she is Twilight Princess :)
shes cursed
also purple is sexy...
"cough"
StinkomanFan: In universe or out of universe?
Why is fluttershy yellow?
cause yellow=urine
I don't follow.
so i finally deduct that my hardware trouble roots in a broken hardrive. so today i got a new one. together with an OS on bootable disk someone was nice enough to burn me
beacuse shes bright like the sun:)
yea but look at it too long and you go blind
daaaaaaaaaw
first thing i realize when i try to install it: mainbord is indeed fucked too
SHouldn't celestia be yellow too?
nope
shes fins how she is
Celestia should be purple...
Twilight should usurpe celestia
so then i take this old spare, cobble it together.... and now for some reason it wont recognize any keybords. or mouses
Artifact: Twilight should be yellow then since she's the "bright"(smart) one of the group
which worked yesterday
it's like it WANTS to break all at once#+
:'(D'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAW
Why are celestia toys purple
Another question: Yellow is the color of Fear, therefor shouldn't Apple Bloom be a deeper orange considering she's more brave than most of the ponies?
Why is Pinkie Pie pink lol?
so yeah, in case any planetsiders are in here. could be a while til i'm with ya again
twilight purple because purple socks

Tons of homework

we know
i wont explain it in detail here now. that would take too long. in short: last week, laptop power inlet fired, sent to the workshop. then my mainboard and harddrive broke, presumably on the same day. and today the replacement hardware i found decided it doesnt want to recognize any input hardware anymore. so those ports are fucked too, it seems
I'm trying to help write a group paper while also working on another paper
i know

All from one lappy?
Fuck life jesus crhist
Jeez. It probably fried the whole thing.
sorry, hello y'all!

Atleast not here, maybe in pms

I am not asking you too. I am just trying to be real with you. In any case I am sure you can figure it out on your own. You have made it this far.
Whatever it is you will deal with it, just like all the other horrible crap that has happened.
Everything leads to a climax, Barbetos
So. Deal with it.
All things must come to an end.
Do you have issues with the end?
It happens to everyone.
IN BED
Yup I do.
But I am not goign there.
stop saying c&@*
I know it does.
Make peace with your turmoil. Just don't push it on others.
And furthermore why would you want to bring anyone else down?
I want help you dummy
Not pushing it on you or other people.
Hm. Well I am done. I has dinner to cook and some anime to watch.
SB64 would help me out but he is afk.
/me sits on Barbetos
Barbetos: your thoughts on dark souls 2?
I still need to look at that.
goodbye
So how are you all?
Later Artifact take it easy.
Hi Irish_Pony

hi Irish_Pony
Hiya Irish_Pony. This evening is starting out pretty well me thinks. How are you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLzr45zpVG4 8 minutes of ponies
Good, talking to my special somepony
And now I get distracted by Cry ENgine 3 stuff. .'/
ha
heh, that face looks funny in the font I'm using
What?
oh
.'/
YES ORANGE CHICKEN! w00t.
o.O
god, batman the animated series is so perfect
ssssssooooooo how but them bronies?
irishpony has a speshal sompony?
worst fandom
Irish_Pony we exsit
ZZZ yup
what is worst fandom?
bronies are the worst...besides homestucks
Eh...I personally don't like cloppers.
11,02poniez o3o
cloppers are a part of bronydom
dat SuperBrony64
pft please Dr. Who is the worst fandom
^
Excuse me, the brony who is both super and sixty-four years of age, it is time for bed.
11,02Dat meh o3o
a show about time travel?? theyre totally ripping off doctor who!
:P
Bronysith: They are the ugly head of the fandom, but yes they are brony.
ohai SuperBrony64 ^_^
dr. who fandom always stoned, so they don't care
/me kidnaps and adopts Scootaflew
11,02Hai BladedWings :D
Okay scartch that the COD fandom is the worst
:(
tries to fly away from alexxm. It's not very effective...
Halo fandom is the worst
Oi.
no....God of War are tight as hell about their fandom
Don't y'all be saying things like that, gdlk_ouo.
/me hugs Scootaflew "i'm your daddy now
Halo fandom does suck too
We're better than the CoD community by far.
All video game fandom is the worst fandom
Anyone have any idea when the next stream is?
lol
alexxm: o.o
Whenever a moderator feels like streaming, Scootaflew.
Scootaflew whenever the mods feel like it
CoD and Halo fandoms are same
whats the matter Scootaflew
Okay thanks
I think the cod fandom needs to be broken up into console and pc
"we need offsite backups"
Actually gdlk_ouo, there are loads more kids in the CoD fandom.
"ok, ill set it up."
next month
DashWithRainbows: aint that the truth
alexxm: PONYNAPPER
I find the pc community to be a lot more considerate than the console
"what the hell we used 500gb of bandwidth last month thats insane why so much whats going on?"
well, maybe
"you asked for offsite backups..."
^
That's because there are less kids, Punkie_Pue.
i find fandoms to suck period
I know.
Scootaflew i didn't kidnap you i adopted you
PC > Console
there is no good fandom, just ones that are slightly more tolerable than the next one
^
Irish_Pony: fanboy get out
there is no surperior system
I hate the TF2 community too, yet I love TF2
13GLORIOUS PC GAMING MASTER RACE BEGS TO DISAGREE
PEE-SEE IS GAWDTIER
alexxm: I don't remember anything http://mlpchan.net/rp/src/1352401393018.png
Bronysith says the guy who plays PC games
Shizuka: but some of the best games of all time are on the console
Irish_Pony: and ps3
and ps2
and original xbox
and gamecube
Shizuka! Stream something!
and NES, SNES,
Bronysith: actually, there is. dependsw on which angle you look at it. in all things hardware, consoles are far behind modern gaming PCs
Dat true, Bronysith
13but dcd wants to stream
and PS1
Anyone into gamecube?
I was
13Bronysith: and all of them can be played on PC now
N64?
gamecube <3
not me
Scootaflew: tales of symphonia was boss
13all those platforms
13in one
that also
emulators
Shizuka: yup, but they are from the SNES
emulators everywhere
Bronysith funny, Im on a PS3 right now
13and psx
13and xbox
13and wii
there is an xbox emulator?
really? the wii?
and ds
Bronysith: I loved playing it when I could, but I never could get it. I understood Vesperia alot better for some reason.
what was psx i forgot
ps1
WiiU > Wii
13it's rule 34.c, if it exists, there is an emulator for it
^
lol
I hated PC gamers they always think they are best no matter what and that PC owns all consoles.
MASF123: have you ever treid mouse?
Shizuka and my mind went dirty
Shizuka: nice, cause then i dont have to spend money on consoles and games to play, but i still respect the games that came out on these consoles
Shizuka So there is a Vivi wub emulator?
Dark_Horst: What is that I am new to this rat thing you call a mouse
13console lock-in isn't something to be proud of, considering how much consoles have been holding back the industry
Eh, emulators rarely ever work well, unless on very old consoles.
13DashWithRainbows: what do you think i am >>
cause Chrono trigger, final fantasy 6, persona 3, legend of dragoon,
My problem with consoles is they are just watered down pcs For the price, why not buy a pc?
Hey Shizuka how do you like the snow?!?
shadow of the colossus, prince of persia sands of time
I tell you, it's near impossible to find a good rom for the original super mario bros for NES
13hate snow
Shizuka, I wanna ask. D'you have any of those old-timey point-'n-click aventure games?
13depends
Punkie_Pue: Agreed source games are like that all the time.
13if you mean myst yes
For consoles I mean
And I couldn't tell you why, but nothing beats playing a game on it's original medium
Like Police Quest or Monkey Island?
13no
i prefer pc over consoles simply because of modding capabilities of games
13i do have freddi fish though
Playing pokemon blue on my gameboy colour just feels perfect.
Shizuka how can you hate snow?!
My friend trolls me at duck hunt... He controls those ducks like its nobodies business...
i just say, play games on whatever the fuck you prefer, if you have fun, then have some fucking fun, just dont try and shove it down my throat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOlJixJAhPM
what about stuf
Haha, you're talking sense there Bronysith.
PLAY FREDDI FISH
Hey arnold was the best
09,01okay so
lol
I want to have a controller, but not all PC games offer gamepad and when they do, not enough buttons for all the inputs.
09,01who here follows JoJo?
I'll sit and watch ANYTHING at this point.
13snow can go die
09,01As in the series, when I stream it
Any of the mods got Pajama Sam?
liek sports fags
Bronysith for once I agree with you
Pajama sam mods lol?
Irish_Pony: die in a fire
NewDCD: i do but im very busy atm, dont think i will be watching
Irish_Pony: Snow sucks. I get cold easily and snow is hard to drive in. :|
i love snow
Or Spy Fox?
not me NewDCD but i'll gladly watch it ^_^
I like Snow
Bronysith love you too~ <3
SNOW SNOW SNOW
09,01not sure if I should just stream it now
i wish it snowed here ;~;
Bronysith: I hate sport fagz
I love the snow. Its by far the best terrain to ski on.
Irish_Pony: you were pulling a fanboy shit earlier, so dont be a liar saying you agree with me
And build bunkers in
You tried concrete too?
Bronysith, that's funny when we have gaming discussion you seem to be offensive on different opinion
We should get Jack T. Herbert on Bronystate.
NewDCD, how could you stream a Manga?
I watch it, DCD. It's hilarious. XD
over here it is snowing tomorow
snow is nice. until you're 18 and have your drivers license. then you will hate snow too
Irish_Pony: earlier you said "PC>consoles" so therefore you are being a lying sack of shit
Bronysith wtf
I haven't tried concrete, but i have tried asphault.
You mad tight
NewDCD: yeah it would be nice if you could stream it closer to friday, a lot of people who follow it arent here, prolly studying for exams
Which is funny because I don't think it's trying to be hilarious
my exams end wednesday tho
09,01true
Driving in snow suck though.
09,01people have exams
Bronysith I was agreeing that as long as you have fun with video games who cares? :/
yes it does.
Especially with bald tired
Exams in January for me. ;___;
09,01guess I'll stream it now and restream it on Thursday alongside the Chuunibyou debut episode
Hydroplaning all day
tires
thanks NewDCD
Irish_Pony: but you were pulling a whole PC superiority, so dont try and fucking lie
In truck with no weight in the back
snow
Dari y u schedule so weird
UK schedule is best schedule
:c
twilight_squirtle: A couple of weeks
That
*weirdest schedule
s the cloud for you.

I hate Crhistmas
damn, thats a errible schedule
*terrible
:P
ANd yes, my mom made orange chicken.
Pft.
U HATE X-MAS?!?!?
Anyone want to stream MvM I will be happy to play
Bronysith why would I lie about have fun with video games? Hell I have a Xbox360, PS3 and getting a PC soon
Physics, Maths, Maths, and Chemistry
Nonsense, my schedule sucks too
I can't blame them if they do as well.
I <3 X-MAS.
ZZZ yes I do only lowered prices and snow I care about.
I don't get X-Mas break until the 21st.
Core 3, core 4, mechanics 2, mechanics 3
MASF123
Irish_Pony: you pulled a superiority bullshit, stop denying it, you are already making yourself look bad
And I return very soon after January starts.
ditto CriticKitten
For maths
ZZZ
?
So basically my schedule sucks too, I'm just not in denial about it sucking. :P
twilight_squirtle: Nah Chemistry is nice too
Ah, well, good luck on those then, Dari. I'm sure you will pass them all.
Charger: Yep
and with that im done
Done with the semester. Don't have to go bacl till January 28th
Bronysith does it look like anyone else think that?
To be honest the only one I really need to work hard for is physics
That's why I dropped maths this year
09,01okay guys
09,01signal get?
*stress
NewDCD: hell yea
Think so
~60% gets you almost 100% UMS sometimes
Damn, Dark_Horst that was dark....

Ah well. It looks like my copy of code geass is broken
09,01you don't have to
I'll just watch this.

COCA-COLA!
09,01and you're about to see why

"i give you free will, so use it EXACTLY how i command you to"
Bronysith: actually, biology explains that quite nicely. it's to motivate you to poop
What's wrong with being gay?
Bronysith: Don't start a religious debate in here please.
yes sir
It was not even him. You should look at MASF123
I could go for a nice pizza with pepperoni and stuffed crust right now
He has been trying to start something all night
^
Barbetos, saying that God sucks is not a debate
It is an opinion
...
thats how debates
are starteed
no
he's a cynical bastard without the charme that would make a cynical bastard interesting to listen to
yea, yea it is
Well don't start goading other users by saying stupid things like that then.
Just stop. really. Just ignore him like the rest of us.
/me grabs Barbetos

Anyways how is everypony?
especially when the teenage mutant ninja turtles showed up Barbetos that was awesome
Irish_Pony excellent
Dark_Horst: I did not read that comment sorry.
same for you Irish_Pony?
Barbetos: or when david tennant showed up in the tardis and brought those hot aliens from the planet of amazonian babes
phoenix wright ace attourney is the best AA game, apollo justice can burn in hell
Dunno why david tennant was there. The guy who the show is based on left.
Don't blame him.
....i want my gauss saw. it's a horrible gun and a tiny insult to balancing... but somehow i grw to like the little fucker
Deacon good, Im talking to my special somepony
Barbetos: you made quite a mess
"cough" bullshit "cough"
It was not me.
Irish_Pony: Awww
Irish_Pony fantabulous
Those alien girls
Barbetos: them and their ...tentacles
Bronysith why? why you hate me?
The bacon was nice.
XD
from behind?
Barbetos: they knew how to fry some bacon
If you want to.
And scooonness
i mean, seriously, one was sooo hot, she could literally fry bacon on her navel
From the planet waifu.
it was weird when she turned out to be a dude
Navel Baconator.
Deacon what about you, you got a special somepony?
I was fine with it. We ahd gone to far for me just to forget the tenderness.
Barbetos: but hey, it was still a great time, those hot aliens were hot, even if half of them were dudes XD
Of love making.
REAL Love making.
O___O
indeed
Unlike Bronysith and Barbetos I need to get out, I can't stay sitting in this chair all day and look at the computer screen my whole life. See you all later. Even you two. ;)
best 84 hours ever
Bronysith: here's one for your things-to-do-in-life-list: climb up statue of liberty and dring bodyshots form her cleavage
Irish_Pony can't say, don't really meet that many people here, but I'm ok with it

and so do chicks
I liek robots.
Of the giant kind.
i love how in almost every episode COOP rants
about shit that happened that is mostly his fault anyways
is Alchemist around? No? Good. What do you call a physicist who's bad at math?
13a consultant?
A Chemist!
but lets be honest here, if anyone here had a robot like megas, we would probably end up doing the same shit he goes through
or be dead
cause you know, its a giant robot
jcelios: BA DUM TSS
so do i
then again, he modded the fuck out of it so that it plays like a video game
13he modded it to play like a CONSOLE game
13ruined the robot entirely
Shizuka: well then you're screwed
and it was all worth it
what's red and bad for your teeth?
Shizuka: but you already have an EVA so stop complaining
13he did not realize megas was built by the GLORIOUS PC GAMING MASTER RACE
a BRICK
Shizuka: you already have a robot,
well...monster robot thing...
just, just go back to your tang
13mmmm taaaang
back in the day i played mechwarrior with wasd and numblock
constantly breathing the tang
while i have mega slush
13orangensaft~
/me giggles.
one day then i realized that i, in fact, CAN enable mouse controls
13but you don't have mega slush
#game got so much more awesome that day
13the slushy is destroyed before you can have one
o rly
Shizuka: then we destroy the Regis MK V and get a free slush machine
Oh wait, this isn't even my final form
just stick with your tang and your whiny partners
*partner
teammate, whatever

I like how people think mando's OC was at the beginning of the episode, even though it wasn't
:D
I'm very hungry!
Scootaflew: just no spoilers about the eps that havent been shown yet, those are not allowed
Give me the salt

I'm looking at you people right now with disgust, about the Photoshopped Luna Picture
So cynical
You know what, that wasn't so bad.
And evil.
I don't need no man in my life!
/me takes Barbetos to bed
Photoshopped Luna picture?
Has everyone in the chat goner insane?
You all better get ready for many Rainbow and Scoots pics... http://i.imgur.com/CZXhq.png

Something like that Vordox
So aside from TvTropes am I the only one who noticed how much Luna sounded like Rarity?
13yaaay logins are finally back
I could reenact with your computer if you want a first hand experience.
13TheGentleManBrony: same VA
TheGentleManBrony: /)_=
Lol
Tabitha ftw :3
13oh wait ffsplit doesn't like streaming to ustream....
http://i.imgur.com/05Hvh.gif
Shizuka: I know that. I mean her Luna voice sounded a lot like her Rarity voice in this episode.
Tabitha was also the old mare
WHo wanted her horse shoe
Does this mean Shizuka will stream the crafting of mines today? :D

Coolio
Owned
but you don't need scrcap
TheGentleManBrony you're indeed a slowpoke
TheGentleManBrony: slowpoke meme. you might want to look that up
13scrcap is more useful for video streams
but Shizuka streams her pc games
Shizuka: You're gonna stream?=3
TheGentleManBrony: Yeah, Tabitha wasnt fully in the "Luna" zone at the start, but she got into it by the end of the ep.
baldurs gate is overrated
Guys. I KNOW ITS THE SAME GODDAMN VA!
No you don't
She's not a tree TheGentleManBrony
TheGentleManBrony: well now you do
13ffsplit+dxtory is great for hooking onto opengl/directx threads
Or a spoon.
13but ffsplit doesn't like ustream
he cursed tabitha. he must die now
Calm yourself
No reason to take drastic measures
I can agree tho.
I WAS COMMENTING ON HOW SIMILAR HER LUNA VOICE WAS TO HER RARITY VOICE AS OPPOSED TO HER FIRST APPEARANCE!
Just use the pistol
