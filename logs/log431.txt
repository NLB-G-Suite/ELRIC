Ya'll wan tto hear how bad it was?
derpy_pony here where i live, it is about getting drunk ^^
Go ahead, Monfang.
Where I live, either nothing happened, or a lot of shit happened I just didnt notice it
for me it was everything is closed and no one could sell me stamps
kinda looks like the beetles
Across the entire nation, less people showed up than there were at the START of the Occupy Movement.
buffering?
nothing happened in england as far as i'm aware
No stores were shut down. No workers walked off the lines, the unions didn't close down the Golden Gate bridge or hender traffic.
nothing happened in england as far as i know either
Monfang: It was because it was much warmer than it was in september. It was a nice day ysterday.
And Im pretty sure nothing happened at all in my city...
Basicly, it's like the advertized setting off the mother of all fire works.. and it fizzled out.
Whats this?
Neverwhere
Monfang Nothing much happened in NYc.just a few marches and whatnot.

Yes.
oh its a twixie pic
yay drawing <3
kirzstryfe, yes.
yeah tis fine kirz
That better be who i think it is...
yup kirz
Both Applejack and Rainbow Dash are competative. However, Applejack takes a loss in stride, complimenting Dashie. But Dash rubs her win in Applejack's face.
1,3it's a unicorn :3
Ninjazz indeed
It's a pony :3
I only hope its the right unicorn. >_<
who's drawing?
ill be back in 20 minutes
...
YEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!~
This song is so awesome ^^
So Twilight's house changes with the seasons. Does that mean the leaves are removed during winter? Did we see that?
1,3what, would you prefer trixie?
listeing to fesr of the dark.
Nope.
Watching someone draw while I draw... interesting xD
I like where this is going.
Please continue :3
kirzstryfe do Lyra <3
I hate doing the lines for faces. Anooys me.
FIRE
WATER
Did you know there is a lot of meaning behind Twilight's race number: 42?
lol
Meaning of Life
1,3no
Twilight has total 7 stars on her flank.
1,3it's the meaning of life, the universe, and everything
1,3big difference :p
Monfang yup
There are exactly 42 points on the stars on her cutiemark
bell rang later!
There wa smore, but I forget. It's on the trope page.
cya
8,1Twilight Sparkle has exactly 42 legs
Malavolent: doesn't she have only 6 stars with the big one?
Title drop!
Invi: There is a big one and a smaller one under it, if you look closely.
Malavolent i know, but that are 6 if i remember right.
8,1i want someone to draw me a Twilight Sparkle with 42 legs
also, hi
and now i want to draw that
hey Chrusalis hows your day been
hey Chrysalis hows your day been
Malavolent dat big one and dat thing behind are 1 star for me ^^
chrysalis hi :)
moin Chrysalis
lots of work annoyingly, hows your been?
morning Invi
and hiya candy-mane
good Chrysalis
Invi: Oh come on, don't ruin the numerology :)
Malavolent 6 makes more sense ^^
/me throws coind
8,1candy-mane: totally draw it
/me throws coins into chat
Invi: Why? 7 is more famous number I'd say.
okay everypony i have to go
bye bye
>:3
cya RainBowJack
Sometimes, I worry about Pinkie Pie.
Malavolent because 1 star for everypony from mane6=harmony=friendship
how come Monfang
/me gets impaled by coins.
Malavolent => 42=Meaning of life=friendship
/me heals pyrocatboy
I think there is a reason for her acting the way she does. Like she's intentionally acting that way to hide from something.
Invi: Ok, ok, 6 is fine too.
:)
Invi: Twi's mom has 3 stars, what would you say about that?
well given how easily pinkamina came out Monfang you may have a point
Malavolent i need more specific information. I need a picture of her cutie mark ^^
So what did Twilight's Dad have? Wasn't it a cresent moon?
http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lxeqc6OH1Q1qincmao1_500.png
There you go.
Hmmm... 5 pointed stars.. Twilight has 6 points.
http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110625163627/mlp/images/3/39/Twilight_Sparkle's_Dad.jpg
Monfang: twilight always had 5 pointed stars
pyrocatboy: how can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat
No, she has 6 points
liking this soundtrack
Her mom has 5 points
Malavolent maybe it is something about Luna? ''Stars help her escape from moon''?
Monfang: i said twilight, not twilight sparkle
And.. they aren't the same thing?
Monfang: http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OXQcDqb1joM/TaqCQUwBF8I/AAAAAAAAA1A/0qW8qfaqwyo/s1600/twilight+mom.jpg
bye guys
bye alexxm
Invi: Or maybe, maybe it doesn't have any secret meaning at all... since everyone from mane 6 except for Twi have 3 of things as a cutie mark.
so i just saw the CollegeHumour My Little Brony animation
a moon inside a moon?
How odd.
8,1and it was very very funny
We drawing Lil Miss Rarity?
Monfang: its just be being very specific and mixing generations
8,1Chrysalis: awesomely!
yes G1 twilight is now twilight's mother
yay the site actually works in school
Malavolent yap. like most of the other background popniez ^^
/me pokes Litwick with a stick
*poniez
Bad.
CCCP, welcome.
too bad i cant see the stream
moien CCCP :)
Invi: Though that one pony with hammer and lightning over it is most probably a reference.
Ninjazz, that wasn't nice. :(
Ah
hello Ninjazz
hi Invi
Litwick: Be happy I only poked you with it. ;)
Malavolent ya maybe a small Thor reference as a gag
also twilight sparkles dad's cutie mark looks like trixies a little bit
what? trixie doesn't have a crescent moon
CCCP kirz is drawing Rarity while listening to music
CCCP: kirzstryfe is drawing bes- my favorite pony :3
thanks :)
brb
kirzstryfe do you have desktop poniez? ^^
LetsGetNekkid: no it doesnt have a moon, it has a wand with a star shape at the end
1,3yes, but I haven't set it up so they appear under the stream window yet
:(
but ultimately i think it looks similar
I see the only pony I need to see :3
No it doesn't, KwakLad.
Nice music, btw
Trixie has a cresent moon and a wand.

its not really a crescent moon
Twilight's dad is a cresent moon with a smaller cresent moon inside reversed.
1,3and just so you know, I'm not drawing a pony
= o
:O
lol
X3
oh snap
So in other words, Rarity?
sup regs?
It's just a sheet of magic
You are right, person's who's nick I refuse to speak.
Holy shit... I have tis song somewhere...
xD
I forgot what its called though.
Anyway, I'm kinda hungery.

This sounds familiar...
Someone else cna theroise what their talents are.

Yeah, I did.

Thanks for reminding me to download all the anime opening songs :)

Ninjazz: they are, just differently so
Their nothing compared to Japan
/me rolls eyes
true *shrugs*
Meh.
brb..finding food.....
I wonder how many bronies are in Japan.
WAIt
Malavolent: Unfortunately, not very many.
bronyinjapan for one :p Malavolent
perhaps a few from that blog I read
I'm more interested how many bronies exist in general.
I don't know if it's bad or good thing.
Is Equestria an country? There was this episode Cutie mark chronicles,and aj said when se was a filly Manhattan was the bla bla bla city in whole equestria??? If its a country why dont they speak their own language?
Could be the whole planet for all we know.

Malavolent: Oh you so silly
Ninjazz: Shush, you.
Mrs is her name ?! :O
Uhhhh. No you.
NO U.
Dat It's not over yet
Well, if I want to be creative.
Consider how Twilight's name is Twilight.
Mrs. Sparkle could be Midnight Sparkle.
yea
But she's too brightly colored.
Whaat??
inb4 Mr Sparkle is Afternoon Sparkle
its not over yet. well duuh!
Ehhh. Let the fic writers deal with it.
Wheres the purr part
Aren't you a fic writer? Just saying.

1,3out of the 2450 songs in there, it seems to like the metal today
Ow.
Whoa
i don't even have that many songs
xD
Bah. I only have 2220.
Hmmm. Sounds around the amount in mine.
I dont even have that many megabytes of space on my hard drive.
I might have more actually.
Malavolent: I have 2220 songs, it's only 14,14 GB.
1,3it's 14.64 GB
I doubt I've listen to all of them.
This is PUNKROCK, not METAL!
Lets see.
Well, I just got back, so I'm going to go eat.
Kammerjunk: Really, I expected it to be around 30 GB.
Whoa, what's your overall capacity, kirz?
35.5 gbs 6_9
I know I havent listened to all of them
Uhm. I feel kinda tiny with about 10gbs :P
Don't be. I download A LOT of stuff. Hence my passion for modding sounds.
damnit Ninjazz beat me by 800mb
that's alot of songs
A lot of it is trailer music and OSTs and usually ambient orchestra
I don't know how you guys can have so much music.
I have around 300 songs and that's enough for me.
1,3around 250 GB I think, using a laptop that's a few years old
I don't listen to all of it.
I actually work with most of them.
my music folder is 6.24 GB

If you walk away, you don't hear me say. Please~ Oh baby~ Don't go! Simple and clean as the wait of your making. Feel tonight. Its hard for light to go...

Ninjazz: I wished that you made the mistake to spell doughnut, because I really need one right now.:D

I know I've heard this...
Ninjazz: Oh, well, I got off of school early, got off at 1:00 PM after starting only at 8:00 AM.:)
I would like bleach, but the lengh of it's story prevents me getting into it

pardon the terrible spelling there
fashionister?

nein! /grammarnazi
Portmandeau of Fashionista and sister?
So what came first, The Halloween episode or Skyrim?
Dken2021 when german, then do it right: grammarnazi = Grammatik-Nazi
halloween ep?
Of mlp
With Luna
¡no! /spanish
Intentionally bad song
Any computer wizard in here?
Hey guys heres the first draft to my new fan fic please tell me your honest opinion http://www.fimfiction.net/story/23903/The-Force-of-Friendship
ah the star wars one?

i edited it a bit more
brb
OHAI!!!!!
so, who's drawing?
allo Hazard, it's Kirakura
er.. kirzstryfe
stupid tab
:D
Dken2021: i know dat feel
hiya im back
now onto ch 2
Bronysith: Oh, thanks for the link! I'll read it right now, and after a while, I'll give you ways that you can improve this story, but mostly points I like about it.:(
:)
Ninjazz|Night: you awake?
1,3poor Kirakura, gets all those tab pings meant for me lol
TheRainbowDash: ty i am just trying to get the story together and then ill edit the punctuation
he should feel honored
may Takeo be with you all!
/me bursts into flames
Bronysith so, wha cha doing may 4th?
Bronysith: Alright then, I'm actually trying to write a fanfic of my own, and will have the draft maybe done by 5/6 (estimated 10-15k words).
It is my first ever fanfic, by that way.
/me douses the flames of Midnight_Tempest with a steaming stream of justice
same here TheRainbowDash
TheRainbowDash: whats it about?
Hazard: i asked for Just Ice... jeeze...
:)
> asks for ice
> Gets pissed on
That's an interesting technique for gradient shading, there.
Hazard: Rainbow Dash joinging the WonderBolts after her sepctualar performace at the Canterlot wedding, but her arrogance dispells her friends away from her. So she must choose her friends, or her life-long dream. (Rainbow Dash Starring in: Alone)
Hazard: oh, you pissed on me... you die now *pulls out a large knife and jumps him*
:<
Pretty basic idea to start out with, but very flexible and workable.
TheRainbowDash: sounds amazing. if you get the wording and spelling and whatnot right you WILL have a FAD going
because of how I launched a FAD of Dead SPace crossovers :)
good luck TheRainbowDash
im happy person
Hazard: Alright then, I even have the idea for my 2nd and 3rd story, and will try to publish them too, 1 a week. But finals and studying have gotten on my way, and so forth for the next 2 weeks/month.
yes from me, a fellow author, to you, an author to be, good luck and best of chances.
hello again
Hey everyone!
Just a quick update to let you know that we're working to unlock Victory & Commendation packs for those of you who played Operation Exorcist, but we've run into some unexpected problems.
TheRainbowDash: i just updated my story for the first time in a month i hope my readers dont hate me :(
damnit, curse you copy paste
Hazard: Oh, I hopew my story is at least decent to read, it mat not be a masterpiece, but at least I tried to make a great story.:)(
TheRainbowDash: i wish to read it :O it will be... glorious :)
SO GLORIOUS!
Hazard: Oh, alright then! However, school may get in my way, if it isn't already. I will actually try to write the frist chapter of my story by today.:)
what site will you be publishing on?
(first)
When dont they have problems with something....
I believe first at fimfiction.net, and if it becomes really good, I may go to Equstria Daily, at a later time.
For my later storied, you know.
(stories)
;) best of luck
things get exponentially harder when you deal with the volumes involved with this
Wish me good luck...:D
Also, up for playing some Chrysalis? Otakon is on playing single player right now
sure, i should be working but this physics is hitting me rather hard atm
is there ANYBODY chating other than us? i mean come on theres like 112 other users in this joint
What kind of perspective is this gonna be?
I know, right Hazard?
either people are idling or busy... or they just don't want to talk
I would, but meh
It happened for the last 5 minutes or so Hazard.:D
Digit|Skyrim: playing Skyrim? oh my...

Actually for me Digit|Skyrim, not interested in Skyrim.
kick ass
I might nap in a bit, idk depending on if my bf gets back on fb in time

TheRainbowDash: when you get into the gameplay its kinda really fun but i lose interest in a few days :)
everybody... glomp the living piss out of xmasskills

I once foun $20 on the ground, holy hay.:I
:O
/me joins the converstation
how coem Google images is so damn dirty?
nuh uh

TheRainbowDash: i was once at target and i was really hungry but had no money i found 5 dollars on the floor and bought myself chips and soda
yea...
well fine then
Hazard: Exactly.
thats nice xmasskills
kinda convenient and inconvenient at the same time if you ask me :D
meh

xmasskills: Awesome then! Once I picked up that $20 bill off of the ground, I did the nom dance.
Hazard: its a rule of the internet if it exists there is pron of it
there's a dance?
my dad found a one hundred dollar bill at work :D
(Yeah
>..>
. . . What is rule 34 ?
(Yeah, let's nom! Put your spoons in the air! Let's nom!)
we never refrenced the number
Princess_Cadence: YOU HAVE THAT LUXURY
..what?
Princess_Cadence: o_o, well, porn for anything exists, that is R34.
Princess_Cadence: NO! You do NOT want to know!!!
I have a story to top all of yours, a vending machine once gave me a gold dollar in my change
TheRainbowDash: i once found a 20$ bill on the floor near my house i was small so i showed it to my sister and she took it and bought pizza
ok..
xmasskills: Wow, so lucky....
hmm
Princess_Cadence: Rule 34 is 'If it exists, there is porn of it.'
hence the quotes
oh
Aww yeah!
TheRainbowDash no it wasnt my sister stole my money bought pizza and i only got a few slices
wait, so is spanish confirmed for equestria?
(makes a Rainbow Dash awesome face for this song):)
so basically there would be pron of Jupiter and an astroid getting it on
xmasskills: Oh....
Hazard: i actually saw that one....
Hazard: exactly
cowvarkian spanish?
mi amore cadenza
Hazard: hard to find perhaps...
:D
iirc, that was italian
I think
well fine then
i WILL find something that doesnt have pron of it
be that way
I WILL!!
Hazard: I don't know, very hard to find some porn, oh, got some R34 Dash now. *pomf*:D
with your extremely similar languages
but whatevs, spanish and italian confirned anyway!
Itailian?
TheRainbowDash: my family enjoys taking money from each other my dad once won a contest and got 100$ for food and my sister took it all
Wait, italian?
wait, latin?
:[ <---- This is my face,when Celestia banishes me to the sun when she finds out how her money was stolen...
why are we waiting for languages
Oh god, it IS Lil Miss Rarity.
xmasskills: Wow, that money balancing, so for my family too, one time, my family almost borrowed $200 from me in a week.:|....they payed me back after a few MONTHS.
what does everyone think the new episode will be about?
everything
..me?
Hazard: Return of Chrysalis, teaming up with Discord.
Episode of what?
i hope it's a CMC episode :(
Hazard it's gonna have ponies
TheRainbowDash: my family borrowed around 70$ in a week i never got payed back....:(
I hope discord will team up with the mane 6, but thatll never happen
New episode will be about Fluttershy fulfilling her destiny as the destoyer of worlds
:D
oh cool stickerbrush symphony
THAT would be fucking canon
no,the new episode will be about me
i hope the CMC get their cutie marks in season 3
bah
theyll never get cutie marks
xmasskills: I hate it when my family says that "Oh, I'll pay you back tommorow", and then they don't, and this repeated for me for over 60 days.
wow..unlucky guy
soo, youre aloan shark with no enforcers
TheRainbowDash: kick your father in the groin and your mother in the taco and take whats yours!
I hope the Cutie Mark Crusaders get their cutie marks at the SERIES finale, Celestia knows how long that will be.:)
In my grand fanfic concept, Apple Bloom and Scootaloo get their cutie marks, but Sweetie Belle doesn't get hers until she's already an adult.
well actuaally im theo ne whos unlucky,im in the hospital ill.
DK+gala?
HEY

*in one
ill watch StupidSexyCJ
:O
Princess_Cadence you are forever doomed as a one-time character
Princess_Cadence: Yeah, possibly, I would want you to show up in that episode too, and me too (Dash):)
Princess_Cadence: congratulations, you're the new Luna
or like nazi germany?
:O new Luna? no.
or communist russia?
cowvarkian: a perfect brony society
hmm
no, luna was a... 4 time cahracter?
*character
Nightmare Moon.
>_>
Luna even got her own unique episode, multiple appearences.
and i got mine..
Nightmare Moon is a forever one-timer.
hmm
HMM'
as far as you know
i think luna's character will be explored alittle more in 3rd season but no princess ever get that much air time
season 1 only had 1 Luna to my knowledge, then i can only remember 2 eps in season 2
hold that though, I smell bacon....
celestia does
no..
>_>
wait what?
..
.
cowvarkian: not really

CrimsonPhoenix: I guess so.

Howdy, everypony! How are you all today?
allo Sylandest
Hey there Sylandest

Sylandest is the best yes he is the best and now we will invite him to the Molest FEST!

Sylandest: I'm doing just fine today, be working on my first ever fanfic later today, the first chapter is expected to be done after today.

TheRainbowDash: Ahh, I see. I wish you the best of luck with it! If you want any advice, feel free to ask! hehe
12oy vey
crack the language and you will get vslr
13you know the food situation here is bad when i'm finally having to add ramen to the grocery list...
12this is STILL disturbing o.x
You DON'T normally?
14o.o?
. . .
Shizuka: pt;u?
13our stock of ramen noodles is supposed to last practically forever ><
Sylandest: Alright then! I even got my ideas for my 2nd and 3rd stories as well, so I'm well prepared!
12Catherine
but ramens are delicious
and horrible for you
D:
1,3one does not simply add ramen
TheRainbowDash: good to hear! Can I ask what they are about, or are you wanting to keep it quiet until the grand reveal?
Ramen doesn't last too long here, too convenient for its own good
ramen is pretty good but it is PACKED with sodium
or, salt
(being)
14..?
14did I miss something?
you disgust me
I think it would take me 150 hours to play all the songs I just downloaded if all in a row, but I'll be playing them through Audiosurf
not really though
(3rd story is military related things)
TheRainbowDash: sounds like they'll be good stories! I'll be looking for them! I've got an idea for a Soarin (soaren?) story, but i need more time before i start working on it
TheRainbowDash: whatchatalkinbout
Sylandest: Oh, alright then.
xmasskills: My fanfics that I'll write in the future. The first one should be done by 5/6.
:O
YAY! :) :)
TheRainbowDash: oh well ill be sure to read them when they are out

No matter..
12I have no idea o.o
And I'mmm...here.

In general i guess =S
12but what woul,d that have toi do with Roara, SS? o-o
TheRainbowDash: did you check it out yet
who's streaming?
12-, -i

lolololo

Its pretty random from picture to picture xD
12that's what I said
anway getting off of logmein
Just for future reference..what color is the ground in Green hill zone supposed to be?
is it supposed ot be orange or brown?
Back
orange
Not much action today...
so both?
Bronysith: hey man long time no fight
Orange AND Brown
hiya xmasskills
Wait, who's streaming if not Wrek?
no fight right now xmasskills im working on a fanfic
I doubt my drawing will get good enough to look like decent art
So.. nobody knows? T.T
Bronysith: awww k is it out yet or you still writing it
kirzstryfe:
its kirzstryfe
I was going to ask if someone would volunteer something for my fanfic. I'm still hoping someone would draw something for it.
I just eradicated the Dark Brotherhood in Skyrim today
also is anypony here a computer wiz?
Airpuff I guess it can be taken advantage of
xmasskills im working on ch 2 right now but you can read my prologue and ch1 if you want
Bronysith: hook me up
I finished editing my fanfic. I just have to go through the final touches.
I can't draw rings for shit
They always come out a bit wonky
Ah alright.. thanks Dken2021..
I'll go back to drawin then x)
I can draw okay circles I just cant get the thickness of the rings right
xmasskills: http://www.fimfiction.net/story/23903/The-Force-of-Friendship
Hey all.
I don't have the patience to draw. I did do some pencil work. Would take me 10 hours to do a piece.
allo Mattcrowley2a
I think i drew a pretty good motobug
But I don't have that passion. It is like everytime I pull the piano to start learning. I don't feel like it.
I have a conflict
I AAAM IRONMAAAAN
I want to make video games but I also want to draw
If I learned how to play the piano, who would listen? Then why bother...
making video games is frustrating.
you can always draw for video games :P
making videogames is like learning a whole new language
indeed
There is a designated artist who draws up everything for the game. The programmer than inputs the data so it animated.
CrimsonPhoenix: http://derpy.me/LkqIJ
My brother made Castle Crashers. I know from what he has to go through.
Yea..but in this econemy theres no way I'm going to do it
flutter_spin really?
Yes. He was 1 of the 8 that made it.
wow...
nice
I would always pitch my ideas to him. Some made it in the game.
i don't suppose any of you know Latin?
nada
Plus I live in Wisconsin..there isnt a place i could do what I wanted for miles
/me gives Umbreon a D for a grade
/me flees
!umbreon !espeon
Also Gamefreak y u no make 3ds pokemon game
I gave up on trying to be a computer programmer. I'm 'good' but definitely not worth the stress.
I've had this idea for a RPG with a linear motion battle system like the tales series
That moment where you spent 2 hours trying to make a thing work when all you needed was a ; on line 97
Ugh, super internet derp.:|
I came up with this idea I think is good but I bet other people will think its stupid
come to think of it, I've never heard of the tales series while thinking the battle system
ha
I never wanted to make something for others. I always wanted to be the one to be told what to do.
script
that's what I meant
who runs it :3
and when I found out it's been done before, I was a bit fustrated, but I'll still make it anyway
I wish I could show you guys the idea I came up with
Dken2021: why frustrated
oh so it's not just a bot
okay
Well, I guess I will get back to my fanfic. I really hope people like it. CCCP has dibs on it :P
CrimsonPhoenix I thought I had an original idea
but oh well, namco beat me to it
I wrote it in Open Office I dont think I can link it
by a long shot
tales series been around for a good long while
I know

11,02All I know is that a reverse bias on an extrinsic semiconductor produces minimal transport of charge carriers across the junction until a breakdown occurs, which results in a massive current flow.

i see....
so many sciency words
ohai
allo Jim
PROFESSOR GET YOUR ASS OVER HERE AND DECIPHER THIS EGYPTIAN LANGUAGE
jk but seriously i get it sorta
All I really understood is that something like a insulator breaks down and a current of idk flows better
SuperBrony64: That fucking confused me.:O
pfft, scientst and their verbose speech
how does that work?
ugh
Magnets
That's how
Sounds electronic
No.
The fact that this old Toshiba computer has 141 GB hard drive nut the macbook air for 1600 dollars has 256 gb flash memory

That's how
True
That bothers me...alot

charge carriers as in pulses of energy? other than that idk what would work on the level of nanotech

He said to me when I didnt want the Air, not sure if it was at my old one or non macs
They've got their demographic
I kinda feel sorry for the consumers who buy apple computers when they only browse the internet
He said "do you want a computer that lasts, or a piece of garbage that puts out
lol
=/ it must have took Wrek years of practice to draw lines so straight
Omega: So he was asking if you wanted a PC or Mac
Its supposed to be MY COMPUTER, MINE so I should get the say on it
Whato_o
CK|Asleep: I think, i had no idea what he ment by garbage
Macs are for Schools. Pcs are for gaming
Probably a Mac
piece of crap?
This is fucking retarded
the cheapest Mac Air costs 1000 dollars
kirzstryfe: Wait,, what song is this? Never heard of this before.:P
Bbl. Bai everypony
and guess how big its GB storage is?
For any purpose beyond graphical design, the PC is generally the superior OS.
Bye RainbowAsh! (kisses you)
Good Ol Days YAY!!!!
bie rainbow ash
TheRainbowDash: Griffin Village - Autumn
64GB with 2GB memory
ded
Jim: Oh, thanks for the information then.:)
That is so pathetic I could cry Apple...
lol
Macs are decent for playing with media, but they're rather poor for doing things like "any sort of office work", "gaming", and "general functionality beyond being a glorified iPad"
What kind of comp costs a grand and has 64GB
Well the only thing I like about Apple is the iPod and ITunes for pony ep pirating
Good afternoon, all.
CK|Asleep: Macs now get the "avoid at all costs" award from me.:|
the most expensive one for 1600 has 256 GB
I find it funny, my little brother put an apple sticker on his laptop to seem "cool"
ohai WallDives
this song where have i heard it
Hello WallDives! (waves and hugs) How are you today?
Ohai WallDives
TheRainbowDash: good.
allo WallDives
hi wall dives
mario_pony: It's Griffin Village - Autumn
He must think its so great because he hardly uses it for non internet stuff
I want to actually play games on mine
That must be why
One must know the demands of the interweb to choose wisely
TheRainbowDash: Pretty much. They're useless for gaming as most games can't play on them. They're bad for office functions to the point where Microsoft had to create a port of its "Microsoft Office" software SPECIFICALLY FOR MACS to give them that functionality, and most menial functionality is worse on Macs. Also, despite what people tell you, they're actually less secure than PCs.
I may sound like a idiot but what is a intel core processor?
that bothers me that most people who buy expensive PCs only use an internet browser, you're using only a fraction of it, just get something cheaper
CK|Asleep: ...."You wrote a whole wall of text, and I didn't even read a single word!" - Dash:D
hmm
O.O
ohh
You're bound to see less viruses only because no one bothers making viruses for Macs. In actuality Mac OS has a very poor backend that has been independently tested and found to be inferior to both PC and open-source.
a third Omega?
I mean look at this a Toshiba comp for 729 dollars has 750 GB hard drive
and a 8GB memory
Domination is at hand....
Apple YOU FAIL
good deal
Know that, had to put up with this guy boasting "LOL Macs are so good they can't get viruses lol"
Also I hate if I show even a little attitude at my dad he gets pissy
I got a terabyte of hard drive space, and 6GB of memory for 800 dollars.:)
i am omega
When I built mine, I gave it a 1 TB HD for pretty cheap actually. I dunno why Macs have such piss poor memory and HDD.
Godd damn this toshiba comp for 379 has 500GB hard drive
I know that feel, my uncle's llikes mac stuff too
Apple YOU FAIL AT COMPUTERS
hmm
kirzstryfe: you should record yourself drawing and upload it to youtube as a Time Lapse video
And I've got enough room in this frame to easily store a couple more TB HDDs in there, though granted it's a desktop but still. Mac computers.... >_>
Can macs to ANYTHING besides just browse the internet?
Got an Asus g74sx laptop, 8gb memory, 1TB HDD
TheRainbowDash: Tell that to my father...
Can anybody do !EQD please, I made my own update script, but I need to make sure I made an exception for this irc :)
He apparently thinks its so great...
quite good for gaming on, but such a hassle to drag around
Jim is it bad that I thought you said Anus instead of Asus?
!EQD
Thanks
Yea TWO OF THEM
Yeah, I would probably not have an anus laptop
Rodonies it only works for you?
To anypony that wants to read my fanfic i just added ch 2 so tell me whatcu think http://www.fimfiction.net/index.php?view=category&search=The+Force+of+Friendship
Thats enough to fucking buy me a comp
Omega: Give me a half hour with him. I've got a CpE degree so I can probably convince him otherwise. :p
He got one for himself and my mom who is has trouble with technology
so.. BLACK OPS 2
Trouble with technology? sounds a hella lot like me
Can someone explain was Wimax is?
Black Ops 2?
U srs bro
eeyup
Wow that's dumb
Ugh Darkts3, do not even mention Steal Your Money 2.
She keeps turning the computer into sleep mode when she's done with it
i want that game for the Zombies
Black Ops wasn't even that "Black Op"y to begin with
One of the comp says 4G Wimax...what the shit is that mean?
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2689/
13http://i.imgur.com/BAWCl.jpg WHAT COULD IT MEAN
Which makes me suspect that the CoD designers do not know what black ops are
TRIPLE RAINBOW Shizuka
And it just sounded like a good name

Bronysith: you mentioned it earlier
How are you today?
Bacon[Hazard]: o yea

Wb Bacon[Hazard]
i use this http://derpy.me/TDHTx
I hear the train a-comin', it's rolling 'round the bend. And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when.
I dislike luck based mini games
Indeed
does anyone want another link to my fic just incase you missed it earlier?
i need publicity anyway :D
Now which ep to pirate next? Any suggestions?
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on. But that train keeps draggin' on.
So i take it theyre humanizing rarity?
OmegaMetroidBrony: Whatcha piratin' ther?
Bacon[Hazard]: ...what kind of fic?
MLP Eps
Kammerjunk: Dabloons
XAX: crossover :)
Quickly came on to ask, would anybody be interested of a livestream from Gamescom this August?
with four Bethesda games
Crossover of... :o
Fallout 3 Fallout NV Oblivion and Skyrim
Oh how I love ALL those games
I swear to god if my dad buys me the Air I will flip my shit
Fun fact: Pirates didn't actually swim in dubloons. They used their coins for useful things, such as not dying in the middle of the ocean.
Good luck...
all these computers in this best buy add are way cheaper and have way better memory
I still dont fucking see why he thinks I want the Macbook Air
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/17867/My-Little-Bethesda#comment/534385

If i can suggest one, i just bought a pavilion g7 and its amazing.

/me is enraged
why WindWhistler?
WindWhistler: Oh god the enrage timer ran out
Wipe it!
OH YEA OH YEA
Okay, so I went to Gamestop today, excited to get the new Animal Crossing game...
Turns out they PUSHED IT BACK AGAIN!!
:O
Now it won't come out until August...
OH HAAAAAAAAAAAAIL NAW
WindWhistler: theyre running on Valve time.
Oh hellllllll naw.
01xD
And to add insult to injury, IT'S COMING OUT AT THE SAME TIME AS BLACK 2 AND WHITE 2!!
I used to have one friend in regular school before I got home schooled
Bacon[Hazard]: Don't worry, they'll release it Soon™
Black 2 and White 2?
lol
Wait, wait, WAIT... Black and White 2?
WindWhistler excellent, and hai
B/W2 > Animal Crossing.
OMYGOSH
Quietly..carefully... AND AGITATE THE HELL OUT OF THIS SNAKE
WindWhistler, I want you to go find who ever did this and BEAT THEM TO DEATH WITH PONIES
That's horrible timing!
Pokemon Black and White 2
Oh.
Well, darn.
You havent heard of black and white 2?
:3
I want Black and white 2 so badly
Black & White 2 was a fantastic game.
I can't get two new games at once!
Or at least my mom won't allow it.
I hadn't heard about Black and White even o_o
I was underwhelmed by black and white.
Also damn it Gamefreak WHEN WILL YOU RELEASE KELDO,MELOTTA AND GENESECT
But this is infuriating...
Jim: Basically, the game is "You're God. Do God-stuff."
did somebody mention black and white 2? http://i1221.photobucket.com/albums/dd467/DKen2021/1334748013842.png
I was so excited...
I'd donate but I have to get monies like an illegal...
is anyone getting Pokemon Conquest?
just curious..
OmegaMetroidBrony: You make video?
Dken2021: That made me laugh.
OTAKON IS PMSING!
BUT I'M STILL MAD
Nope...
Think the last pokemon game I played was gold
/me dies buried in a box.
Love ALL the gens
according to a randomer we picked up
^
<Chrysalis>	OTAKON IS PMSING!
I liked all the gens but black and white.
Pokemon Stadium is best pokemon game.
except gen 4, was lacking a ton of fire types
Black and white was awsome
WHERES OTAKON
Black and White was good, but HG/SS was MUCH better.
Gen 4 and 5 were the first times I didn't get a fire starter...
I swear to god tough if the fire starter for 2 is ANOTHER FIRE FIGHTING TYPE
I felt like they jumped the shark.
I disliked Pkmn stadium because it was so slow
Snivy ftw
Hey, does anypony here know a thing or two about recurve bows?
So any suggestions on which ep to pirate?
Cobellanez: considering Gen 1 and 2 were very slow paced, thats not surprising.
DONT PIRATE.
Support the show,
But I will...
That doesn't matter
The attacks took a long time
Like I'm gonna buy the things off iTunes OH HELL NO
Winners don't do pirating! Good thing I'm not a competitive person.
Bacon[Hazard] why did I laugh at that?
I just download my episodes from YouTube
I love how some people say game freak is running out of ideas
yet look at electrode
YouTube downloader :D
Ditto
its evo is just itself upside down
I'd say you run out of ideas when you change ONE LETTER
and that was gen one
I assume it went like this
I remember being specifically pissed about one pokemon
So..we need a evolution for voltorb
How about we turn it upside down?
lol
GENIUS GIVE THAT MAN A PROMOTION!
They made it bigger too
Fun fact: Pirating has been punished harder than class B murder.
I mad it took 4 gens for my favorite pokemon to get a evolution.
So whats your fave pokemon?
00,10Inb4 cathode
Audino
hands down
I named mine Fluttershy :3
Also Molola doesnt evolve from Ludvisc...why
inb4 anode
The jellecent pokemon creep me out...
1,3Diode: evolves from two voltorbs that got too close
Right now, you're all speaking Greek for me.
have you read their entrys?
	The fate of the ships and crew that wander into Jellicent's habitat: all sunken, all lost, all vanished. This is from the black version
I remember questioning the Pokemon that is part pig part spring
who's drawing?
Hmmm when'd we talk about Pokemon?
Seriously? It stops bouncing and it dies?
What kind of a life is that?
Drifloon's a childnapper according to it's dex entry
Its cute though
ScootaChicken go to bed liek, nao.
a very up-and-down one.
Dken2021: supposedly its too heavy to do so
How are they BORN?
DashWithRainbows: NO
I WON'T
Yes.
You will
I WON'T GO TO BED
NOPE
You will go to bed.
Cobellanez: Bouncing
Yes.

will you go to bread?
Alright, you are not allowed to go to bed then

im reading a clopfic right now
also, Ditto with Imposter is scary as hell.
Cool story Bacon[Hazard].
Laugh Bacon[Hazard] LAUGH AT IT
about SPike and Sweetie Belle
...
Darumaka's droppings are hot, so people used to put them in their clothes to keep themselves warm. This is disgusting
I swear to god there's a new update to be installed every time i start my pc...
Ditto with imposter? What's that?
HOW DARE YOU MENTION THAT OMEGA
Imma see you guys later.
So, what, how do they possibly fight water types?
Does Surf just insta kill them?
bai Arteza147
Jim: Imposter is a ability that lets it transform when it hits the field. (with all the stat boosts).
Dken2021: thats the white version entry for Darumaka
Wait so I'm not allowed to laugh at clopfics?
Litwicks are so ADORABLE
/me Shrugpony
Wait, I thought Ditto only had that transform move
They're soul stealing hellspawn, but adorable ones non the less
It does
the more you learn I guess
Jim: they have a new ability that doesnt let them waste a turn doing that anymore.
Ditto VS Ditto, THE ULTIMATE SHOWDOWN
You know what else is an adorable soul eating hell spawn? baby metroids :3
Well, it DID
hello all

She doesnt talk much
There is some sequence where you fight her with a legendary pokemon
Obviously she's Slender Man
She's
I think it had to do with the shiny legendaries
Man
Hmm
:D
Slender Man don't care as long as it fools you
and apperently once you trigger the event the forrest gets bigger
Which btw he's out to get me...
is this green day
Slender Man is just Slender Man
yay green day
Slenderman just wants 20 dollars.

So you are a stoner?
:D
oh yea, well, that's like your opinion man
no i believe its a drug Cobellanez and im not a stoner
Bronysith: And there are also people saying it's completely harmless. I agree with neither side of the cannabis discussion.
Don't muddle the issue with yer fancy truth strechin
:3
next event: Darkrai distribution.
Kammerjunk: id rather have a muffin
Muffins!
MUFFINS AND CUPCAKES
Can I hug anypony today?
One side of the whole cannabis argument thing claims it's completely harmless, the other makes it sound like even touching the damn stuff gives you cancer.
Also the text in the underwater ruins confuses me
Ponies and Bronystate are drugs

i live in a dorm :\
The University of Hull is a good school ?
Bit of a warning, Bronystate is an EXTREMEMLY addictive drug...
sucks how The Hub isnt a regular channe;
channel*
^
i hate google
*EXTREMELY
OmegaMetroidBrony: Gotta have some more stuff man!
OmegaMetroidBrony: it is
i don't :D i can tell you where i found that
13we're a gateway drug
But if it as, you wouldn't come here!
/me starts twiching
lol
XD
13you came for the live episodes on saturday
want me to pm to you or just here ?
lol
13you stayed to get some of that sweet sweet movies
u stay for everything
stayed for whatever the hell else
its obviously not that hard to find anyway
I came for the saturdays, I stayed for everything else
13and now you're addicted to the midweek streams
god we got crappy movies this week dont we?
02my mouse just died :|
Troll 2 is FUNNY
true
do we really watch movies or pony stuff?
13is the whole thing funny, or just that one scene
Troll 2 is probably going to be WMC
RDashie: are you new???
nah
02well, it didn't die, but it's acting really odd LOL
YES
I was addicted to the midweek streams when I knew they existed
/me implodes
the chat will save troll 2 from wmc
question does your email start with stupid or i'm checking the wrong nathan
13that's what you all said about titanic ii, and yet insurance is our new meme
never watched movie night
probably wrong one anyway
Now I'm trying to get my friend to come on here EVERY MOVIE NIGHT
none of my many emails start with stupid
Don't do drugs kids...unless its Bronystate
Troll 2 ISN'T AS BAD AS everypony says, Sure its horrible made but i think its funny.
Shizuka: it wasnt WMC because of how we had "fun" with the comments.. its kinda of a bad system
Or ponies
to badd i have 3 just for spam
Though he leaves when the pony eps come on :
Guys I'll bbl
*:(
RDashie: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix7vrluEm4E
13if you're having fun mocking the movie, it would be wrong of us to deny that to future audiences
cya luna
mhmm
13compare Epic Movie which no one wanted to see
Darkts3: nah, point of WMC is to neve r watch it again, but titanic 2 was fun with chat
later LunaTheBeloved ~
I like Silence of the lambs also
who the hell is this 123 people and why do they know so much about me
OOOH HOW SWEET THX :3
Chat makes EVERY movie better
didn't know you have your own page
:3
13compare Space Mutiny... i mean really, if it weren't for MST3K, would we have ever wanted to see that again?
Shizuka: I wasnt here for Epic Movie, how bad was it?
well im not that new.....just didnt watch movie night like ever
/me has acquired ribs
whats the current WMC?
they even have my family members listed...
13about fifteen minutes in we'd lost a good chunk of our audience
Shizuka: did u guys keep watching it?
Shizuka: wow....
CCCP: we watched the whole thing
13friday soldiered through it, but we dropped it for the saturday
alexxm: /me has lost ribs.
oh wtf my myspace is still up :O
13we knew it would be WMC from the start
Darkts3: that sucks
Chrysalis i'm guessing for starters using unfoundbug for everything is not a good way to hide info
13but we monitor the viewers reactions
monitor EVERYONE
anyfeather im going guys see allof you at fmn
13so that ultimately it's the viewers as a whole that decide to condemn a movie
Bai RDashie
hence the switch to using multiple
bye RDashie
bb love ya
cya RDashie
i even know your birthday btw
Shizuka: And with Troll 2 Im guessing we might add another member to the hall of garbage movies.
Who chose Epic Movie?
I have nothing to react with
=/
13we might
13Epic Movie was a guaranteed failure cause it tried way too hard to be offensive
ok, you can stop getting all my personal information now
13and succeeded
Troll 2 is probably going to be set in a house... THE END
but isn't it so bad it's good Kipkat07_Mare
Ive seen troll 2
I only know the meme
oh? i should try watching epic movie
also, Uk Of Equerstria lists that to google
But now I know where it came from
kkkk but i like your oc http://i48.tinypic.com/i3f4ls.jpg
her erverperner
me too, i lost the code for it though which is annoying
oh hai IshBestPony *noms*
i lost my code too
hey IshBestPony hows your day been
troll 2 is like watching a movie made by aliens that think they know how to make a movie.
:D
/me nerms alexxm and OmegaMetroidBrony
hi IshBestPony
/me and CCCP
:)
btw you should close your linkedin if you don't want that info out ~
god i need to find a troll movie
Wolfram Alpha is best pony
10Dinner
*gasp* how bout Troll 1
Darkts3 theres a troll movie this week for the b movie
fun fact: Troll 2 has nothing to do with troll
i recomend troll hunter Darkts3
Wolfram Alpha is best pony
woops
Darkts3 how about Meet the Spartans
unfortunately, thats one i was asked to setup by an agency
who wants to play draw my thing with me?
i think The Room is the worst movie ever
Litwick: your....thing?
apparently its easier or something or other
they never messaged me on it
can we nominate The Room again?
It's an online version of pictionary.
or we still have to wait?
CCCP: tommy wiseua or w.e. says he inteneded it to be that
whose drawing?
CCCP: if he did, then its one of the best movies ever
twilight_sprinkle: really?
gerdber everperner
Shizuka: are you guys ever planning to do something like weekend season pony marathons?
twilight_sprinkle: ikr
*erverperner
CCCP: so he says. someone anonymous from the cast said he didnt intend it to be bad, idk
WHOS THE MYSTERIOUS STREAMER!?
13there's a possibility we might do marathons before season 3 starts
well it's there, guessing you could always sent an email asking to take it down
O3O
gerdber erverperner
13we haven't quite pinned down our plans that far out though
)_(
twilight_sprinkle: hmmm
Bai IshBestPony
Networked multiplayer tower defense game ? sounds interesting
Shizuka: how bout a marathon on July 4th
herro Shane377
marathon of s 1 and 2
o hai CCCP
OmegaMetroidBrony wert?
also why when i start getting info on people i can't stop ?
a marathon's a marathon, whats to plan?
13timing, who streams what and when
Sorry but that looks a hella lot like Good Bye every pony
13backups
=/ why does Rarity look like a octopus?
lol
oh now your going through my website
13lots of stuff to work out when we want to do events
isnt there always a mod around?
Ermerger Mertrerd Berner
if everyone gets eps, it should work
oh crud
that means you got my email
13mod yes, mod who can stream not really
hahah
in any case, that would a) fill the long break before season 3 and b) give allt he new guys who come here for pony, pony
I don't follow Ish
13ja but you guys don't come here just for pony do you :3
actually i got that info somewhere else, i havent even started to check your website
...anyone for Smash Bros?
No
nope
OmegaMetroidBrony Er lerk per
wait... what?
Only if Val streams
Chobits is a good anime btw i like it
then I come for the pony :3
ponies are still my fav <3
well, not me, but i've seen how many hop into here and are suprised that there's all kinds of stuff one but no horses
stop researching me god damnit
13i mean we do pony related stuff, kirz and wrek drawing, val playing with you, stuff like that
...again, anyone for Super Smash Bros?
mind you, it's awesome stuff and i love it. usually
Gerdber erverperner
where on earth did you find the tower defense though
if someone stream poniehz = added bonus
imo This stream always has the right amout of pony in it :3
Wrek needs to invite ppl when he plays Starcraft 2
thats my 3rd year project, where else would bother listing that
again linkedin
... i never put that up there
Shizuka: kirzstryfe draws?!
wall of text incoming
13kirz is streaming, silly
Shizuka: Thats a lie though
oh wait... nvm
Kirz is streaming huhhhh
k
i see what it did
It can't be Wrek as he isn't here and plus the eyes aren't like his... soul piercing ones...
Shizuka: of course it's boring. that'S where the idea witht he marathons looks attractive
while i realize that too much ponies will ruin it, imo you guys should at least occasionally stream 1 or 2 eps
i uploaded my CV
ive watch each ep 10+ times
If you want ponies 24/7 use Youtube
and it parsed it, and made everything public
Shizuka: I did not know that :P
I've seen each episode once
OmegaMetroidBrony: plus no Twilight in corner
honestly wen u think about it we dont watch many ponieh episodes theres like four over the weekend and thats it
not demanding, lets not start that, just saying 1-3 eps per day doesnt hurt
04k
And there he is on the names list...
Cobellanez: you need to watch them again
I plan to
Giggle at the Ghostly mashed with Dance Dance by Fallout Boy: YES
All at once only though
pretty much i guess
obtwdrf
BL is up
im gonna watch each episode again
soon
I did that with S1 when I became a brony...
13thing is if you want to watch an episode, there's youtube
13we can't do better than youtube
^
wich game whas the tower one ? i like tower defense
point
Or Piracy
Piracy > Youtube
Its says this shit in the rules
but youtube doesnt have chat, which is a huge part of it
Indeed
13what we can do is a wide variety of stuff to stream
OmegaMetroidBrony: why pirate, youtube has all of it in good quality
13it's more interesting that way
btw, have there been any streamings of the new avatar series after EP 2?
OmegaMetroidBrony http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzhsytrjKG1r683a9o1_500.png
One day... ill stream
http://theadmin.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=14:3rd-year-project&catid=1:projects&Itemid=3
i know, im not saying ponies all day, just 1-2 eps to satisfy hunger
yeah but it rains a bit too often and long sometime here
13sumica does on occasion, not sure when
becasue that was really interesting
it is rather poor
lol because of this stream i ended up watching the Season 2 finale like 5 times
1-2 eps per day, like 1 per 12 hours
idk about sumica
but yeah, just saying that 0 pony eps isnt too good either
Sumica once every solar eclipse of course.
Season finale eh.... Hmmm....
I mean Shizuka >_<
/me cant wait for Sumica to stream Korra eventually :3
0_o a trailer
13dwr~<3
i personally fell in deep love with the season final
Shizuka: which series do you usually stream?
o3o Hey thar Shizuka.
ValtheJean streams ponies all the time >: D
i want code geass stream so bad :O
<3
13since february i've been streaming reboot, beast wars, and wishbone, then added spongebob now and then
just not specific to any Generation...
yeeeeheeeesssss
Shizuka: what i love about this stream is that each streamer shows something unique :)
13^
I'm finally back
He's the only mod to give the viewers what they want
honestly the stream need a little more poniehs but not liek a super lot
RainbowcrashNBurn: thats the idea
RainbowcrashNBurn: agreed

twilight_sprinkle: Read that again
It always upsets me when people say they hate the Beatles
^
The burning rage of a thousand suns.
CCCP: Sorry, I meant I dont like their music, I guess hate is too strong of a word
people are entitled to their opinion, but come on
Polydunami: read what again
CupcakeWarrior: good thats better
http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/online_downloads/glee_cover_alice_coopers_schools_out.html

Feed my Frankenstein
lets see if i can return with something
Polydunami: i was talking about the article.
I mean I'm not really one for the Beatles but MOST of today's music kinda SUCKS
Oh
Today's pop culture as a whole sucks.
What pop culture?

When I was a kid I thought Michael Jackson had the most annoying voice ever
Exactly?!
Ain't That a Kick in the Head?

Er, was

Whoops
Do the mods get pain to do what they do?
8,1my goddamn ISP has throttled my connection to 2mbit/s
2I do that every. single. time
1,3pain, often; paid, never
Oh damn
a real eye opener is to take a look at a chart showing frequency allocations in the US
2Mostly because I save, then don't completely remember if I saved or not lol
or your respective country of residence
its a real eye opener
/me lawll
I wonder if there is one for UK
yep
Kirzstryfe: you sound like a polition

8,1CupcakeWarrior: for realsies, or are you exaggerating?
That is the oposite of a politician
lol Mine's not even 1MB
020_o
it shows that the broadcast bands are only the tip of the iceberg
literally
8,1it's meant to be 8mbit/s
Remember mb is bit 1/8 of a Byte
*noms CupcakeWarrior*
How can I convice my friend to watch ponies?
mine is like 10mbit/s
8,1which, while not blindingly fast, does me fine
1,3I have 1.5, quit your bitching
1.5 bits?
8,1"IP Profile for your line is - 1.75 Mbps" <-- this is the problem
02as a child I thought speakers were speakers |D
I have 2.0
8,1it's basically on the BRAS end
8,1so the step, just after the telephone exchange
I wonder why someone pastebinned those chat logs
8,1the bit that handles authentication, etc.
02didn't really think about them much
so much yellow
quick someone time in blue!

lol
I just thought it was funny
Well then... wb?
8,1see, traffic gets throttled from backhaul to the exchange, to make sure that a bottleneck at the exchange end (eg. from sync issues) does not mean that bandwidth is wasted sending data that won't get through, and will have to be resent
idk I just greet, smile, wave, and wb

light is lot of gigahertz mhz or w/e
03can I rip them to a flash drive/external hard drive or only the interna?
03+l
you can only external
wew
must be FAT32
apparenly excorcist packs should be out soon
8,1because whenever i mention these diagnostics to tech-support at my ISP, they instantly hang up on me

i just got back 15 Mbps using London as connection point
03ah
03OK
03how big would the ISO be, a few gigs?
hello guys
so if a sepaker vibrates in the ghz/mhz/w/e range it could produce light right?
8,1hey Bacon[Hazard]
03I've got some 8GB flash drives
i got 30
It seems I have the slowest internet here :(
3.5-4GB
nah mine is slowest
8,1CupcakeWarrior: where do you live?
03does it split it up?
03>FAT32
no
03so it'll never be >4GB?
cool
probably not
03k
8,1hey WoodenToaster

CupcakeWarrior: I know a guy who still uses Dial-up
03wb

Alright everypony. how long does it take for the moderators (for fimfiction) to accept a story?:P
Oh god
idk
RAWRity: lol
02wb Soital :3
(or approval)
fucking DIAL UP
Hell if i know
Depends I guess
No idea
so just download any CFW you want
TheRainbowDash: about 3 hours to a full day
They add another story every 10 min
Bacon[Hazard]: What....:O
:D
atleast 3 hours
maybe the ones you i linked last night if you want PSN (no guarantees)
/me faints and coughs up awesomeness from fanmgazm
TheRainbowDash: Is it like your other fanfic?
I have about 14 Mbit/s
i had to wait for mine to go up :(
ponies are awesome
^
Wait, I missed it
03I do want PSN
Whoops :$
what CCCP said
TheHoodyNinja: Wait, which one? This is about Dash joining the WonderBolts/
rocking 34 mbit/s!!!
03but I want to put 3.15 on first and see how well Linux runs so I have a comparison
03XD
:$
damn... I think my pirated eps might be taking up too much space on my iPod...
oh drf, you said you don't use Nintendo Zone
Hmmm....
TheRainbowDash: Thats even more concerning
:D
hmm
03I don't, though I did use that exploit to use your own router as a viewer XD
TheHoodyNinja: Wait, why so?
http://derpy.me/1wYfm
Well who cares it's ponies
My upload speed is less than 1 Mbit/s
02http://chzpokememes.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/pokmon-like-a-boss.jpg
aa you knew it already xD
Yeah, who cares? Ponies=good.:)
TheRainbowDash: Well, you see... nevermind
my upload is like 1
03woah
I got the unaltered Derpy >:-)
my uploads between 25-40
TheHoodyNinja: No, it is dire for me to hear this information.
03but I still want a LEGO brick flash drive
Upload is way slower than download usually
ponified memes time ?
02XD
so i took an IQ test, and i got a -7 :(
TheRainbowDash: FIMFiction account link?
They gave the same test to a candy bracelet, and it got a +5
8,1i would like to move to the netherlands and get 100mbit up and down symmetric for €40/month
Bacon[Hazard]: It is the same username as of over here (TheRainbowDash)
serriously TheHoodyNinja
oooooo
i took an iq test and got 4221
My IQ is around 130 last I checked
8,1instead of £15,000/year like it would cost here
OMG it looks EPIC
02http://chzpokememes.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/pokmon-waste-of-a-move-slot.jpg
OmegaMetroidBrony: about how long does it take to download a video?
03haha
its true
8,1last time i had my IQ measured, it was just over the 150 mark, i believe
idk
the don't and will not
*they
those eyes look so souless
but they do work so it's worth the wait
they are
8,1but IQ isn't a good measure of intelligence
No wait, that was my sisters test results :P
03wait what
you can hack flash supp if you jailbreak it
hehe
My IQ is... lets see here
theres a spider in my kitchen D:
...
:D
03this guy was saying you can't pause and slow-motion CLV laserdiscs?
03only CAV
CCCP What's its name?
OVER 9000!
03that somehow doesn't make sense to me
Polydunami: lol
03I just know CAV is better quality
i think mine is 5 to 7
idk
Polydunami: gilda
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VBIe0R2e-A&feature=related
You mean like the movie?
Here we stand, worlds apart, hearts broken in two, two ,two
Speaking of spiders I got my arachnaphobia license renewed :(
8,1and intelligence is partly creativity, which isnn't something IQ is designed to measure
WoodenToaster: i like that song
SPIDERMAN
orly OmegaMetroidBrony
.-.
Yesh saw an ungodly sized spider...
OmegaMetroidBrony: lolwut

Well he told the British to stop fighting the Nazies and just surrender. And he told the Jewish to jump off a cliff so they can keep the moral high ground. As running and excaping from the concencration camps was bad in his eyes.
otakon: got my victory pack but not commendation pack
ok
All the while, he enjoyed little visits with Hitler.
Bronysith i know but your updates are soo short

dat molestia http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2113/
dat puns is bad and you should feel bad
...
also where did the moo come from ? i'm still not sure
For heaven's sake
If the pun isnt bad its not a pun worth moosing
however, by crossing lions and tigers, the growth-repressing genes in the offsprings code get's weakened
so liger are pretty fucking big
blame superbrony
Bronysith: lol
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4619 What a day this'd be for me

lo
mfw Katawa Shoujo ponies
Oh my
iammrcrap: around our names?
twilight_sprinkle: given that it's now 12AM the following day, yes.
Umm
great now he wants facts why macs arent good gamer pcs
CCCP yeah
somehow you endup in a rather adult situation with midnight_tempest Meanwhile
I liek SB64 :3
What.
Meanwhile: you mean you havent slept since then? i wasnt following whole chate
this is interest
Give it to him.... ALL THE REAL FACTS
Seriously: something's wrong here
Yeah, this game has no restraint, at all
iammrcrap: idk i bet sumone else does
twilight_sprinkle: bingo. You win a life time supply of mint icecream.
Or maybe it's just IE9
:D
Apperently he thinks you guys are bullshitting and neevr owned a mac
Woah woah wait wait wait
Ugh, I knew I had a problem
CCCP oh
I know a guy who has a Mac
though i thought the main protagonist was otakon
"rather adult situation"
iammrcrap: sorry
Sax
DAMN IT i got dc and now i had to change my name
He wants evidence why macs are not good gamer computers
Meanwhile: still, it happens. my record is 7 hours of sleep in 5 days
Do you know how much time and money he's spent getting it repaired?
you have epic sax time with midnight_tempest
CCCP its alright;)
I think IE9 is the reason MLFW is bugged like hell for me
lol
I don't think I've ever seen midnight_tempest.
Goddamnit
iammrcrap: :$
lol
apperently he has had "no problems" for 4 years
I used to use IE9, then I downloaded FireFox
Also, why does RAWRity show up and disclose this stuff only when I'm not looking?
i don't write this stuff Meanwhile i just letting you know what was being told in chat
Firefox is free, right?
11,01It is.
yup
i dunno
Idk about him but um... yeah No go
I'll be right back
there was quite a long list of... routes available last time i checked
It costs 300 000$ to use Firefox for 12 seconds.
So any facts why isnt isnt a good gamer pc?
firefox is cool stuff
Plus my friend has trouble running other programs while playing a game
I used to use Firefox, then I downloaded Opera(but now I'm using Chrome)
Chrysalis yeah but that one is the only one i remember right now
and no restriction on charachter m/f human/pony choice
Hey everypony!
Well given RAWRity's grasp of language I'm sure it'll be a colourful, brain scarring, nightmare inducing creation the likes of which H.P.Lovecraft couldn't have concocted.
if you want speed, get chrome, but personally i always preferred the interface of firefox
Happy birthday CCCP!
Oh hai Pinkie_Kittie
hello

l4d2 isnt that harsh if you turn the settings down
I love playing in these matches. I play with these guys daily and they are great.
www.ponibooru.org/post/view/177195
11,01I can run L4D2 on almost max settings on my 5-year-old PC
Rocket launchers are fun :3
You are always in there Jaketehsnake :|
Also, l4d2 isnt that aggresive on your pc woth settings turned down and Textures at llowest
11,01Which was high-end when it was built.
11,01I can't run the game on max settings while streaming though.
Hello, world!

:) I think I'll open up that Single Barrel this friday before the movie stream, can't wait to taste it - it's the kind of whiskey you drink straight! NEVER mix top shelf whiskey - stuff's aged at least 4 years
Look under progress, hit the CPU tab, and see which program is hogging the speed
Meanwhile X His hand named Trixie
why do people alt tab in that game... PLAY IT IN WINDOW MODE AND YOU WONT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE GAME CRASHING...

Glad I'm not in it.
Speaking of fanfiction: I'm doing a panel at PortconMaine where a couple of friends and I are dramatically reading bad fanfiction. If anyone has short, bad pony fics, please link me to them. Thanks!
For a first try, it was pretty good. Although I may need to fix my huge walls of texts, and uneasy dialogue, I did a pretty good job.

my second one kinda sucked...
Calcos4Dead: expensive at $40 for 750ml - aged in the most humid part of their storage - attic, 30% evaporates during aging process, but I've heard it's delicious & worth the price tag
My first fanfic, in all, will be 10-15k words.
my bro is playing cod black ops and he found a scootalo and knifes it and the scootalo was atcully a gernaderroo
Chapter 1 is already nearly 1900 words.
which is why, i dont write fics now.
Cypresswolf: It'd better be worth it at THAT price
Holy!
Do you think I would launch Half Life? My gam crashed and I accidentaly clicked Half Life. It is right above Left 4 Dead

Oh...

Wow.

That explains A HELL OF A LOT
ban evasion, dumbest thing to do here
macs suck unless you build it to work like a pc and its better than your old one, i'd rather have a nokia over a mac, the nokia probly has more memory!
Also he says the os for mac is better
Huh?
/me wails kitty-style because cow friend is gone
actually Shirtless_Tempest, makes sense. bursting in to flames would mean lots of burnt shirts
How do you even ban evade anyway?
wat
/me cries
OMG i almost missed L4D2!!!
so you banned him for being DEPRESSED?
Wait wat?
/me wails kitty-style because cow friend is gone
My dad wont let me...
yeah, I'm sure that'll help him NOT be depressed
Boom!
i will probably transform into 8 before the month is out...
Mutterguy: it is true... i have many burnt shirts, though my pants always make it through unscathed
I dont have my own cash....
otakon: disrupts rest of chat i gues
if being depressed is banable i better go now v.v
Im on my headphones. Too much sounds
DECAPITATIOOOOON
I used to trust the people here . . .
As much as I wish I WAS a giant robot dragon
yikes
But he's not playing...
Ah yes... robbing the elderly blind
Meanwhile X Mandows is only ship now
It wasnt just being depressed, he came in under 2 names and started yelling aat himself for sympathy
yeah
/me does Puss in Boots face at Shirtless_Tempest

does flying attacks do less damage on electric types?
Bronysith: good for you, it's bad for ya

Don't fall for that damn Peer Pressure Hiveind
Alchohol in moderation is amazing
*Hivemind
13nittany probably still can't see me but aim for the legs, it's easier to avoid friendlyfire that way
Bronysith: agreed
Yes it is, Calcos4Dead
Shizuka: I stand BY my teammates in a firing line really
Unsure if I should use a flying move or not
CELESTIA HAVE MERCY http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/411/

13when i take point i crouch
Bronysith: Sure! I'll send it right now!
CHICKEN RIFLE Shamroc
Bronysith, have you ever had a Sea Pony Lyra threaten you before?
13but i've noticed aiming lower makes it way easier to avoid friendly fire
ScootaRifle?
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/24089/%28First-Fanfic%29-Rainbow-Dash-Starring-In%3A-Alone To Bronysith.:)
no pretty sure it's normal damage. not a situation I get into because a flying move implies generally a flying pokemon and thus is bad
Well the question is who is faster? If you think your faster use that flhying move! if not......well idk
oh what the shit
:D FYI I'm still kinda lurking your fic page TRD
1,3friendly fire is the best part though
OmegaMaidtroidBrony: Umm, alright then.:D
