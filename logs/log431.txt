I gave up on trying to be a computer programmer. I'm 'good' but definitely not worth the stress.

come to think of it, I've never heard of the tales series while thinking the battle system

and when I found out it's been done before, I was a bit fustrated, but I'll still make it anyway

Well the only thing I like about Apple is the iPod and ITunes for pony ep pirating
Good afternoon, all.
the most expensive one for 1600 has 256 GB
this song where have i heard it
hi wall dives
I want to actually play games on mine
That must be why
One must know the demands of the interweb to choose wisely
hmm
O.O
ohh
I mean look at this a Toshiba comp for 729 dollars has 750 GB hard drive
and a 8GB memory
Domination is at hand....
Apple YOU FAIL
good deal
When I built mine, I gave it a 1 TB HD for pretty cheap actually. I dunno why Macs have such piss poor memory and HDD.
Godd damn this toshiba comp for 379 has 500GB hard drive
Apple YOU FAIL AT COMPUTERS
hmm
And I've got enough room in this frame to easily store a couple more TB HDDs in there, though granted it's a desktop but still. Mac computers.... >_>
Got an Asus g74sx laptop, 8gb memory, 1TB HDD
Can anybody do !EQD please, I made my own update script, but I need to make sure I made an exception for this irc :)
quite good for gaming on, but such a hassle to drag around
!EQD
Thanks
Yea TWO OF THEM
Yeah, I would probably not have an anus laptop
Thats enough to fucking buy me a comp
Can someone explain was Wimax is?
Wow that's dumb
She keeps turning the computer into sleep mode when she's done with it
One of the comp says 4G Wimax...what the shit is that mean?

13we knew it would be WMC from the start
13but we monitor the viewers reactions
monitor EVERYONE
13so that ultimately it's the viewers as a whole that decide to condemn a movie
hence the switch to using multiple
I have nothing to react with

blacklabels
:D
there is alot of 3d ready in the engine, but i could never get the resources to behave properly, and userinput ontop meant i had to switch to 2d to get it finished
Why does Rarity look like she has human-like shoulders?
Is this anthro?

Hey now Saturn, we use one of the princesses names in here
8,1my goddamn ISP has throttled my connection to 2mbit/s
2I do that every. single. time
1,3pain, often; paid, never
Oh damn
/me lawll
yep
lol
should be for the DTI/Radio Authority
/me brb
inb4 as i child i thought if a speaker vibrated fast enough it could emit light
/me pisses on the planet and laughs then turns into a mix of the mane 6 and humps The UNIVIERSE
8,1CupcakeWarrior: for realsies, or are you exaggerating?
That is the oposite of a politician
Saturn: whats it meant to be?
Saturn: I deal with that all the time
lol Mine's not even 1MB
Saturn: Exxageration, mines at .5 mbps
020_o
literally
8,1it's meant to be 8mbit/s
*noms CupcakeWarrior*
How can I convice my friend to watch ponies?
mine is like 10mbit/s
8,1which, while not blindingly fast, does me fine
Saturn: how can you check the speed?
1.5 bits?
02as a child I thought speakers were speakers |D
I have 2.0
8,1it's basically on the BRAS end
8,1so the step, just after the telephone exchange
8,1the bit that handles authentication, etc.
02didn't really think about them much

03and I can do a SACD rip
light is lot of gigahertz mhz or w/e
03+l
you can only external
wew

hehe
My IQ is... lets see here

Saturn: Is there any definite measure of intelligence, or it is all just potential and personal opinion?
03that somehow doesn't make sense to me
i think mine is 5 to 7
idk
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VBIe0R2e-A&feature=related
8,1TheRainbowDash: well, it's all subjective, really
You mean like the movie?
Speaking of spiders I got my arachnaphobia license renewed :(
8,1and intelligence is partly creativity, which isnn't something IQ is designed to measure
