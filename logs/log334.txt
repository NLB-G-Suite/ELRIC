Ingwaz: thanks for reminding me about it

Drake had long hair? o:

2,14 hope you enjoyed
The Korean jumpscare comic
Shizuka: you're still a pro to me :)
we did
Oh, and hey Shizuka. Welcome to the snuggle pile. There's a fair few ponies here now.

2,14 Shizuka: I'm not wearing underwear?
Shizuka: might as well hear it
Lasharus: what? you read it already?
Shizuka: we're listening

2,14 lol otakon, that link is awesome

10,02I'm going to give streaming on my Mac a try again
don't spoil it
Yes otakon. I have.
SuperBrony64: L4D mp?
2,14 HAI GUISE: HIS LINK DOES *is shot*
/me pats Lasharus on the back "It's okay buddy"
Thank you.
2,14 though fyi, it's probably best to keep these links out of the chat if they get TOO excessive
yeah
otakon: that was creepy butt fun
otakon: i just clicked your link.......
just that one time
can we post scary videos?
no
creepy butt fun is best butt fun
aw
I SHOULD have asked first
holy crap that was startling, but a fairly impressive bit of javascript
or I should have pm'd Fleur with it
yeah, first time I saw it I had to fight back a "OH SHIT!"
:D
#Scary_Videos
I jumped in my seat, mute. Because it was 1 AM
well, Im not going to be taking any horror movie sugestions from otakon. :\
that was dissapointing
I jumped just a lil bit
Fleur: y u no jump?
because it wasnt scary?
not even a little jump?
no
lol
your no fun
everyone else gets the jump
I am used to jump scares
your immune
figures
dat immune
they are not scary
To you Fleur.
otakon: after the first one wich wasnt that suprising because of the leadin, the second is expected
2,14 jumping=/= scared
±p
fsacbv
^
they are bullshit and only horrible horror writers resort to it
2,14 scared is when you're cowering in fear
of course they arent scary... they're just startling
13hey
13hey guys
2,14 being startled is a natural reaction
thats startled
scared is what you THINK is there
well tehn
One moment, I need to quickly restart mIRC. Brb.
13want to know something else really scary?
Anyone here own Amnesia?
startled is what you didnt expect to be there

Shizuka: i never had the same problems with me that everyone else did
^
I'm using Windows ME right now!
Military Intelligence?
13i never actually used it .-.
/me finds out cyanide pill is just sugar pill once again
:(
13aber i know how hacky it was

2,14 also, fleur, GIT OUTTA MAH room

I do have something though!
13aber ME was them trying to hack all kinds of stuff on crumbling DOS

mane money
well... they do have saddlebags so that works too

otakon: wow, that thing you linked to uses ALOT of code and an invisible flash embed to do that scrolling
With saddlebags full of moneeeeeeey
mr krabs is a brony
^
squidward is best brony
mr krabs has crabs
23373 lines of javascript after going though jsbeautify
Phase4: I figured as much, the thing that freaked me out was that it basically locks your browser so you can't scroll up. At least I remember that I was frantically tried to close it the first time I watched it.
Lol
otakon: well it continiously sets position, you can scroll but it resets it
2,14 wait...it locks your browser?
i see the chat
2,14 because I was able to scroll up...
dat chat
well
I scrolled up
for a second
ValtheJean: it might on some browsers, not on firefox though
Hey its the chat!
it did it to me at least
it did stay locked for a second
2,14 I used firefox =/
I use firefox
me too
firefox is best browser
but it kind of locked mine
Hey its the time!
didnt lock mine
/me uses Google Chrome
._.
2,14 hmm...chat on stream? I must take this time to say something memorable which someponies will screencap!
and didnt scare me either
it does kinda, what suprises me is the volume of code
well goodie for you two!
argh
PONIES!
2,14 hmmm
Flibbity Gibber!
:)
otakon: Fleur giggles at the ghosties it's okay
yeah
I dont giggle at ghosts
Hey the smilies dont show up on the screen
I just ignore them
Fleur: Hmmm seems legit
I CAN SEE WORDS
i just tried to pastebin the js they used but its larger than 500kb
2,14 Quick everypony! Watch the stream carefully, one letter of each word is used to create a hidden message!
oh...apparently my brain just shut itself off, thinking about skyrim for a second, go to type in "facebook.com" start typing "fus" before i catch myself
2,14 see if you can decode it!
ValtheJean: if one wants to be technical it is, boiling it should kill the bacteria, but ew
/me knew that SuperBrony64 was streaming
lol comments
Oh god dat song
<--- look my name's on the stream!

Okay, not just me.

I am the White Mare. I am the Soft Pettal. I am the Just Thorn. With rose in hand I will reap the lonelyness of this world and clense it in the Fires of Compassion! I am Shizuka! The Wub is here! (I wrote Shizuka a Hakumen speach. <3)
13i... huh?
that is awesome
TopHat: wat
text wall
Shizuka is best Hakumen
idk
Shizuka is Hakumen
13i am confuse..
:D
i do enjoy hakumen's speeches, particularly the play on words "ware wa jin!"
Hakumen is from Blazblue
13still confuse..
Hakumen is a character from blazblue and he does a long speach
Man I am so fuckin high right now!
:D
sec Shizuka
Ingwaz: I only play with english voices
Shizuka your pony has a rose on its flank <3
on ponies of course
13es ist sakura blossom
Shizuka: Hakumen is from BlazBlue... but all you need to know is this just makes you MOAR AWESOME!
damn
13but i deal in roses
I didnt know that
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8gqDOnN32s
that might help Shizuka
/me goes to rewrite it
that guy died
Shizuka = Hakumen = badass
http://imgur.com/a/A7tLJ#0 i just noticed that both legs on the right hand side are moving at the same time
bed time now
that would be so unstable
anyway, it was basically saying that Shizuka is best pony for making people happy <3

SuperBrony64: i'm a silly filly

Freaking 17 gig torrent kiled by Battlefield 3
2,14 we could make a livestream playlist with only that

PS don't go on the Skype chat right now
oh
I'm sure Mojang will let us know.
"Unsafe JavaScript attempt to access frame with URL" bla bla bla, anyone here got chrome extention experience?
cause personally, it is boring without mods
Pretty harsh to say against Notch
no? alright then, back to google
Phase4 what ya gotta do is take ur computor, run warm water on it throw it out your window and it will be better
Google logic
OneTrickPony: Genius! brb
lol
OneTrickPony: didnt work
awww

Ah..

Something epic is going to happen 8 Feb
hmmm, chrome extentions handle background pages differently, you use a normal iframe instead of firefox's "web worker"
Frank: what?
feb 8th?
Then i will become
21 years old
yay
oh thats right, my internet gets reset on the 8th
Indeed
how'd you know
I know stuff Phase4

Checked
/me wanders in with a concerned look.
Still no Kammerjunk

This is why the world ends in 2012

/me stops walking and looks up at wall, then after a moments pause turns to Phase4, holding his hand up pointing at him.
everyone should use seconds since the epoch
oh

You know what would be most straigtforward date count? 2 numbers for day, 3 letters for month 4 numbers for year
Byebye

I need to get my hands on Kammerjunk before my grammar reserves run out
10,02I do need to go to sleep ;___;
3 letter month/dd/yyyy i have no problem wit, its strange but works
SuperBrony64|Zzz: Indeed you do
mm/dd/yyyy is something someone needs to be shot for
lol it is just 4:17 no big deal
acording to my clock its 7am on the east coast
/me snaps fingers.
Still didn't answer me Phase4
so sleep might be a good idea
/me wishes he had monday off
answe?
Small Soldiers or No Country For Old Men?
answer?
never seen no country for old men
Hm...
small soldiers is the one with the sentient toys right?
Yup
The non Toy Story one
seen that, its fun
with Tommy Lee Jones as one of the voices
'gorgons' right?
Indeed
Wonder off to dream land SuperBrony64|Zzz
nao
Dashie_Dashie is right.
I'll put on a little Ink Spots to get you sleeping
/me clears throat.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pa_nLQmTQc
"Someone's rocking my dreambooooaaaaat... Distubring a wonderful dreaaaaam. Oh I'm sailing along....~"
Phase4: I think I'll watch Small Soldiers. I never saw the english version and I just HAVE to hear Tommy Lee Jones handing out plot whoopings as a 3 inch action figure
As always: if Kammerjunk comes up, tell him that I'm waiting in my #MyOffice
might hire no country for old men, heard the name before juxtoposed to praise

derpy mod?
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/51948537/derpy.xpi for chrome
mabey i'm just a little tired
so Chrome is easier than Firefox?
for extentions yes
unless you want a hidden page
wich SEEMS simple (just use an iframe) but the xss permisions are vague
mooponi: that image is awesome
deadchat is dead
Quite.

strange how you always manage to get into my browswer...
I hate my dad so much
ScootaChicken: you might be a brony
he made me miss Vi's show ;___;
:(
but does he realy deserve hate?
yeah
Phase4: europe, netherlands
there's many reasons why he deserves hate outside of that reason
none of which I really want to go into
ScootaChicken: http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/ae827b611ffe5ba2034f104e824b8492/46594%20-%20confused%20gilda%20griffon%20happy%20hug%20let_go_of_your_hate%20macro%20pinkie_pie%20reaction_face%20reaction_image%20smile.jpg
actually he probably doesn't deserve hate, just abhorrence
i would have shortend the link but aparently my extention broke
dohoho
fine, I'll tolerate him
mfw I log into facebook and 4 notifcations
thats about 4x as many as I usually get...
ScootaChicken: http://mlfw.info/f/887/

lol, i'm using my recording of the episode and chat as background noise, when (spoiler ommited) the chat exceeds 10 posts a second
what recording Phase4?
ScootaChicken: www.youtu.be/mHiRC_sNX4w
y'know Phase4, I genuinely would have loved to have seen a recording of the chat reactions to Derpy in the mane chat
the famous video is just of the Pinkie Pie room
yeah, i;m thinking of doing more
commented on the other guy's video, he might switch to mane chat. dont realy want to do two recordings of the mane room
allso i'm definantly removing the scroll bar next time
if i can get chatlogs i could recreate the mane chat
you could ask Shizuka
anyway I'm off to lunch
see you Phase4 and anyone else
;ater ScootaChicken
later'
bai ScootaChicken
that was really slow, wasn't it?
chat is dead
I just guess people are quite busy doing other stuff at this time of the day
hm...
I'm waiting for my little brother to finish school so I can pick him up
i'm not busy, chats just got no-one in it
blah I give up.
I'm searching through auction sites.
hard to draw really detailed with MS paint.
I need an Illustrator and a tablet
those things are awesome
What are you trying to draw?
Vinyl Scratch Dj-ing
You could try drawing by hand, not sure if that's harder though
meh...
who knows.
I wish I could draw, but it always ends up like one of those childrens drawings
I just saw an ad for pinkie's friendship express on Nick-UK. now
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/51948537/derpy.xpi this works good and proper now, minus bugs caused by the slowness of derpy.me

Phase4: finished the chrome script?
no unfortunatly, cant figure out how xss is suposed to work
oh
it has a different content script system to firefox, arguably better, but it keeps throwing permission errors for seemingly no reason
hmm, seems if you copy links to fast the server throws a 403, wich comes through as a {} at this end. at least its not in my code
Simon2: if i get time i'l try finish the chrome version tomorow, for now i need sleep

Oh great. I'm a UK brony.

^
I think both Discord episodes are playing today

Oh, Woah. ._. This is the tab I'm supposed to chat in, I nev- OH SWEET JESUS IT'S LUNA <3 I have a shirt of you c:
Plutonia Exprement?
OLOLO ITS CRAZY
why do they call it a minigun?
srsly
Google it~
Because 'tis mini if you're a heavy
Sorry, I think Discord was this morning. Its super squeezy cider and best night ever in an hour or so
it's a gatlin gun now.
Now, this is a REAL MAN'S FPS
Sonic rainboom. Should watch?
*yay*
I can't wait for this weeks RD episode :>
But in all seriousnes arrowtobroknee : it's called mini because it's quite small compared to guns with similar fireing mechanisms
i'm prepared for DAWWWWW
ok then
Weird disconnections lol
arrowtobroknee: Also becasue MiniCannon just sounds silly
watching on TV feels weird
what, MLP?
yes
too used to internet
MiniCannon sounds awesome.
I have my xbox with youtube and both Seasons of MLP playlists.
MiniCannon sounds liek a toy
that's how I first watched it.
like*
MMMH
too long
I miss these old graphics. I want to restore one of those early 90's computers to operate like new.
Better than CoD
^truth
It's not hard to beat CoD
Anything > CoD
Very true
So true.
Played it once, sucked at it.
Actually... I've heard legends of a mystical game
same
a game so bad that it is... NOT worse than CoD
no
it isn't true!
I know, it sounds scary
Half-life/any valve FPS are my first favorites
Seconds are mmorpgs or RTS
LoL anyone :>?
Don't play it
I've played it before
Well, it's an okay game if you get practice at it... (not including the singleplayer story) But I'm just tired of people calling them selves MLG and boasting about it all the time~
Since games are the talk again. i have a question I asked a bazillion time but didn't get a single answer to:
didn't like the competition element of it
What's up with Assassin's Creed Revelations?
Did it come out?
Did it not?
No one talks about it!
It came out here.
in the US
Dunno, haven't played assasin's creed since the first game came out
I didnt hear about half life as a kid, I only heard about the game series when 2 came out. I was too busy with Myst during those years
last AC I've play was brotherhood
What's up~ The simulated sky?~
/me slaps Nyria about with a bi.... No
How you can play in this? ITS TOO HARD
Anyone here have PSN?
/me slaps Bronyriffic around a bit with a large trout.
Yes
Xbox LIVE here
...
/me loads Forza Motorsport 4
05DaniilScit|DWARF, you better be joking
^
It's not hard, you're just bad at it
Well~ I'm looking it up Ictiv~
Games these days are generaly too easy
Only real bawses can play doom
liek a baws
Ictiv: Have fun ^^: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin's_Creed:_Revelations
Anyone know where the anti-acta petition on thge uk gov website its?
and SMB: lost levels
Its hard for me... I dont know why,maybe because my hands growing from ass?
sounds painful
indeed
1,3hehe, lost levels
Ill look that up for you, Globetrotter
My TV is 12 years old, which would explain why ponies sound different.
lol
that might be the explaination
hmm..
00,10ho ffffff
>.>
anyone ever played super meat boy?
or meat boy flash?
oh, uk site... Sorry, I dont know where that is. I was thinking Sopa.
I also want a permanent Rainbow dash
I haven'y played it arrowtobroknee but I have seen it been played
I found it but thanks anyway, Cypresswolf
meat boy is brilliantly hard. I got stuck on the hell chapter
00,10wrek mega charge
like the layout of that level
Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results - Einstein
but that's just me.. o_o
Dashie_Dashie: I would give you all my money if you did! :D
Silly, Jim, Doc Browns dog never talked. :3
Who's to say Equestria doesnt already exist somewhere in the universe? :)
my little dahsie?
*dahsie
*dashie
This chat.
rainbows are spicy
Cypresswolf: I agree.
the universe is never ending, who's to say that any idea we come up with isn't floating around somewhere in the universe
if not an alternate universe
Wrek can do it~!
rarity was an alicorn for half an episode, yet she did nothing.
yay~!
Way to go
theory: all of the ideas people have of another plane of existence maybe a connection to a real place somewhere in this universe. Can't prove right or wrong if none of us have explored outside the solar system :P
right?
I've thought of sooo many werid things~
rainbow dash ALWAYS dresses in style
weird*
Yeah, how does that work, Luna is so much smaller then Molestia, Do they keep growing even after 1000 years?
I have a fic going with a theory similar to that one as one of it's plotpoints
well
what if an alien invasion was just ponies from Equestria?
Luna is the younger sister right?
immorethanokwith.jpg
wouldn't she be smaller?
I would welcome out new pony overlords :)
yeah
are the sister's ages ever mentioned?
nope not really
I smell a look back into the past episode.
but they're at LEAST a 1000 years apiece
well
Tia is probably at least 1500
we still don't know what happened on the moon
easy enough
luna may have been sleeping
NMM got sealed inside the moon
It's magic, I ain't got to explain anything
he's how I see it
mobs, mobs everywhere
remember: over analysis keeps the internet intelligent.
When Luna transformed into NMM, she sinced being Luna at that moment.
She was kind of stasis locked
If an alien invasion were equestrian ponies, would they be horrified at our treatment to horses Earth has? I've seen Planet of the Apes, that scenario doesnt end well
lolwiut#
that's why when NMM was purged of all of that jealousy and anger
Yes~ I don't think they would like it~
we got a little Luna
at first
planet of the apes but ponified?
lyra would be so happy
i imagine that we could explain it to the ponies Cypresswolf
get your hooves off of my you damn dirty pony!
jk we can hug.
^mindreader
Use the BFG, if you have it, that is
:3
not seen the BFG yet, I think he hasn't got that far
he would use his BFG, he doesn't have any cell ammunition
http://d24w6bsrhbeh9d.cloudfront.net/photo/2176304_460s.jpg
he has the BFG
Well, that's why I added the "if you have it" at the end
hehe Ingwaz~
00,10no ammo
What WAD is this...
Ingwaz: I'll have to correct you: >turn up speakers to 11 >enjoy
>YFW iplayer volume goes up to 11
PARTY HARD!

Then I crashed it :c

brb
Rainbow dash, front wing
baaaaaad pun is baaaaaaaad
No
very bad
Globetrotter: dunno, i think the stress is not worth it tbh
Thimk Indycar
Spiderman, spiderman
nwn is a pretty old game, i dont know how many bronys are still playing it
Good point ekips I've already got tonnes of stress as it is.
NWN?
Which pony should I draw next?
nwm????
Never Winter Nights?
Chaaaaaaaaingun!
Vinyl?

Fun game
Berserker, that's Quaddamage no?
Or dual
lots
hmm
*Can't remember*
I can only Remember quake
I always preferred the tried and true sword and board fighter
Which was Quad Damage
Monks are hilarious
Goslap the door won't help
Doom beats all modern FPS games easily
Lookatmeimrunningreallyfastyoucan'tgetmehahahaha
yeah
Doom and quake are very arguable
did doom ever have multiplayer?
afk for a bit, parents calling :D
if only it didn't looke like drek
/me catches Globetrotter~
Caught you~
also, brb need coffee
/me stops drops and rolls
I want a remake of the 3 games, and more
well
Not for the graphics
I would LOVE a remake for Doom
But for the gameplay, as it would be much easier nowadays
05things is
using new graphics and such
I thought DOOM 3 was supposed to be DOOM 1 but flashy
yeah
It basically was.
Well, Doom is a classic, they would probably ruin it by trying to remake it
05cant change the gameplay
Doom 3 was more or less Doom
05at all
they could do what happened with mega man 9 and 10
Wrek: enope you can't or it's not Doom
They can leave all the same, but mouselook would be really epic
Which pony, aside from viny Fazana, should I draw. I'm trying to get better.
at the very least I'd like to see some high res textures in this!
8-bit graphics and difficulty on modern console download
Plasma gun :D
00,10hey wrek try the zerker on them
inb4 dead
yeah
zerker should work
Wrek, tip: Don't shoot enemies NEAR you with the plasma
Globetrotter, you could try and do Carrot Top
Done her too Fazana
just draw the body first
*Rage*
creepy
Cherilee?
derpy?
Isn't MLP on right now?
Trying to think of a pony that's moderate to draw, and isn't overused
no
Cherilee it is Jim
no, it just finished
Ahh
Fazana: Lyra
Tbh, I'drather watch doom

I failed fluttershy a bit, she's a little chubby.
I love poking holes in pony haters logic.
sniffle
My cat is like when it's hungry it's really cosy and then it goes: "FEED ME"

why is noone talking to me?
Someone needs to make a ponified version of Doom...
Rest of the day it's ignoring me/sleeping

Pistol bro

WHo's hating on ponies?
Dashie
there are 10,000 bronies roughly
give us his youtube name,we will troll
I heard a voice from Q2? :O
arrow
I need to love and tolerate the s*** outta them
We will love and tolerate him
there's far more than that arrowtobroknee
I think someone needs to make a ponified version of Doom, if it hasn't been done already, that is
ofna01: love and tolerance dude
there is a hell alot more then 10,000
we're at least in the 100k
if not far more than that
Quake and Doom are made from the same people I *think*
i say the millions
we have our own sites
WE HAVE PONYCHAN
I dunno, the cenus figures are inaccurate
I know they teamed to make Q3
well eqd is roughly one year old and got 100million views
Bronies are like the Empire from star wars only we can shoot~
as i was saying
ekips - yes, but that doesn't account for how many individual computers visited it
lol
im with ofna! we need the youtube name
we have ponychan
our stormtroopers are actually worth something!
give...us...the...naaame
We all know storm troopers can't aim
trolololol
indeed
Ah yes,bronies. Does haters trolls you with tons of R34?
yes
oh hold on ofna01
-_-
>.<
Most of them talk about R34
indeed
I've been trolling him for the past 2 days now.
>.>
name plz
But less than 1/16th of the Brony community do R34
I'll link, give me a sec.
:D
: D
i had a dream, where there existed a radical faction of bronies called Gilda's Griffons who were about war on the haters
Don't fuel the fire please
Because our (Russian) haters trolls us everyday,every hour. This is so funny <3
i wish it was real id join >: D
http://www.youtube.com/user/Whyamibzsdmh
don't feed the trolls
das dah guy ^
I've nothing agaisn't russians
05good thing i only do boarderlien then
I have a russian friend :3
brony's,attack!
I just want to laugh at him
love and tolerate him :)
not this time
no, ponychan must approve any attack
I Tolerate, but not love
we must face hoove him
>:D
the description of the video says, that it is a joke and he does not really care about mlp
Woah, as soon as I clicked that youtube link the song "Proud to be a brony" Just went on~
people said he was an untouchable brony hater.
I'll put test to that claim.
don't feed the troll
please
former /b/tard of 3 years, I'm a damn good anti-troll. :>
Okie dokie lokie (okayface)
I personally am an anti-troll
okie dokie lokie
lol
didn't bronyism begin as trolling?
i say war on the haters, griffons rise up!
no
aye!
*Clap clap*
@Quin aye!
My theroy is, if you hate something you MUST give a logical explanation on why.
Quin: stop feeding the hatred :O
I agree, Dashie_Dashie
just let R19 deal with the haters
we dont hate him
Logical explanation on why I hate justin Beiber: Because. kthxbai
we are going to love and tolerate him to death
this guy is hillarious
who
ofna01: I almost cried laughing when that guy said ponies ruins lives.
ydfgjsfJSAGNsang
send him to EqD then
he needs to go to a mental ward
send him to the moon
Take him to Nurse Redheart
to thw mooooooooooon!
Or take him to Trollestia, to send him to the moon for 10k years
He's another troll~ Just don't bother with him if you can manage~
My macintosh vid almost has 100 views
/me yay~
I like how he thinks us bronies will attack poeple who aren't bronies for not being bronies
Hey,take the KillDDoSers too,these parasprites are cool...
i just read rainbow factory :S
I hate SUVs and the people that drive them, because a teenager driving his parent's SUV was doing double the speed limit in a school zone, and instead of slowing down for a turn, swerved into oncoming traffic, hitting my girlfriend's car head on, eventually she died due to her injures... (
like seriously?
Critchley: oh god why?
Critchley: Oh... Are you okay my friend?~
Genuine?
xD fine lol
What just happened
HeavyMetalDash: right? pony haters have no logic.. I swear.

Hitting on sexy alien women

It's just that today's telescopes can see 100,000+ light years way
and this is 300 yrs ahead of us

How much longer until science reaches that level of tech? Mind, we should have had flying cars by now

13you run out of fuel or collide midair, where do you go
Dont listen to her!!!, she just want Interprise for herself! argH!
emergency parachut's shizu
1,3Shizuka: down :3
if it falls a certain distance,the parachutes deploy
then you call upon the sea ponies
13and if you're not quite far enough above ground for them to deploy?
yep. without a system to keep each vehicle from colliding and falling, its just trouble.
then it wont hurt you
13are you kidding?
new drivers licenses
if it fell more then 30 feet,they would deploy
cock blocked by an ensign
falling 30 feet inside a car would hurt your face quite a bit though
13^
00,1030ft is not enough time to deply a chute fully
13it's plenty of time to mess you up good though
well,thats why it has padded interiors
dont ask me im only 15 XD
Wait, wut?
Take technology by force.

ahem,gentlemen?
13you're still talking about multiple tons of car falling under the influence of gravity hitting this wonderfully immovable thing we call ground
Kira_Pony_Yamato - Prime Directive
it works both ways
Screw the Prime Directive...
13that energy has to go somewhere, and your body is a pretty good outlet
i know
00,10thats asuming they only hit ground on the way down
i need to go back to the drawing board
13that too
i make plans for stuff i design
I wouldn't last long in Starfleet.
13plus there's the issue of traffic jams in 3d space
you got a few hundred years to develop
i doubt that shizu
While floating down with a parachute, if youre still in the air highway (5th Element) + Shizuka's point, all that debris falling from greath heights onto the ground below....yikes

:'(
20 minutes of power left? Clock is ticking Twilight. Clock. is. TICKING!
Ponies + Star Trek = ???
they could use their snouts
13some others i think work by measuring your finger's conductivity
13but given a big enough area ponies could operate touchscreens with just their hooves
there were loads of star trek x ponies stuff after discord = Q

Jim what is your fav pony
mfw I discovered restoring tabs on firefox
I can't surely pick a favourite, I love all of them
I just tend to, as a writer, like to give the main character a bit of redemption so it doesn't seem as if it ends in tragedy.
;D
Speaking of Redemption..
They want her blood
I need to play some Red Dead.
00,10did you know FF can even do that after you closed it fully Dken2021

13DUN DUN DUUUUUUUN
00,10It's that deadly coral toxin
Dun dun dun, I didn't understand
10,02Shizuka: Only if it's a vaccine filled with poison O__O
deadly, deadly, poison
dat cardassia
10,02But actually, you can be dead the next second with poison
00,10hills you before you feal the pain.
0,5Why did you hill him?
13people die when they are hilled
13und need years of therapy
I hate when I get hilled
10,02Most biological poison works to inhibit Ca2+ ion channels, which regulate muscle control throughout the body.
00,10must suck to be the king of the hill then
Do ho
I hilled a mountain

Voyager = pwnage

Tovler - it's an overdone joke at this point
13janeway must have thought this was one of those "everything goes wrong" missions
"Yep, that's a hole"
10,02Actually, lethal injections consist of a high concentration of Ca2+ to depolarize the cell and cause an action potential essnetially shutting down the body.

Misery likes people to be around them.
I liked ponies ever since I saw dee-dee turn into a pony on Dexter
yeah-
not that other people be unhappy.
Dexter was a brony before it was cool
I always deduced it as misery, the feeling, causes other misery

"This thread is huge, and it only started this, morning???"
Hah, meme reference
The magic of ponies
Sumica: that video is epic. Gotta love LRR
00,10I like those guys from unskipable
Sumica: all of their LRR videos are just brillant
My little Bear: Friendship is Mauling
Unskippable spawned from LRR's sucess
"Is someone watching new generation"

later emantrollslayer
Why does pega-sis sound bad when it's said aloud?
I don't get it
:P
its just a joke
It's a bad pun. By the way, is Tengen Toppa: Gurren Lagann good?
but... I don't get it...
Brony is a good pun, Pegasis is a bad pun
ahh
...I could be wrong about the 'pun' part
i believe the term is portmandeau
reasearch!
for science!
or however that french "dew" is spelled
start with the reversal of 'bro' Yes, Portmandeau is right
but yeah, essentially it is a pun
Wait... Bro is a condension of 'brother' so Sis would be a reverse of Bro...
Brother/Sister
Sis... Sis... hmmm...
http://derpy.me/v4ud8 WATCH
Brony came from 'Bro-Pony' which could be read as 'Brother-Pony'
actually, i think it more originated from the /b/ application of Bro
00,10hear I thought it came from /b/+pony
I'm not good with words...
a /b/rony
well that was an awesome video
I used to be embarressed about being a brony, now I'm quite open about it :)
and pegasister originated after Brony became a separate entity from /b/
Who would have though that ponies would be cooler and more awesome than "vampires"
And not so oversaturated?
so there are 4 anons in the chat....
*ehem* 5
10,02Brony = Bro + Pony ^_^

hey everypony
heck, i did it from the front row of my Business Law class before
ohai String_Shredder
No allcaps...
10,02I am in class silly fillies
8,1karaoke <-- good idea or bad idea for a con event?
"Ponystate. Are you in good hooves?"
/me ish joking
10,02Good
00,10depends on who sings
/me 8,1can see it being all kinds of non-fun
when did this happen?
that too
if i sing then good idea
/me could not carry a tune to save his life
sing parody songs - I need to Thu'um a Draugr (Moves like Jagger)

FUS RO yay!
8,1Phase4: what is it?
derpy.me button for firefox
Just drew lyra and bonbon
/me 's Animal Allegiance Thu'um has been modified to "YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE ME!!!"
http://derpy.me/FxGyg for example
/me hugs LunaTheBeloved
Is there any suitable 4th wall pinkie hanging from the ceiling pics anywhere?
/me hugs Natleyn
Hi there
morning LunaTheBeloved
Afternoon Phase4
8,1http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0yxN0ZnQug
8,1oh dear, this is hilarious
^
was thinking of that the entire song
hahahaha
Diftraku: if you click too fast your server emits 403 errors randomly, your rate limiting bugs out on cloudflare i think
Flutterblush in the intro :)
Dat innuendo
/me Fluttershy sleeps naked o.o
Phase4: 403 is what it's supposed to give, afaik
8,1Phase4: you can do that with a bookmarklet
8,1in fact, i think there's the code for that on the site
8,1aye
never heard of a bookmarklet either
i was waiting for someone to make that video
Phase4: http://derpy.me/bookmarklet
8,1Phase4: go to http://du.cx and drag the duck picture to your bookmark bar (or just look at where the link points)
8,1same idea
/me needs motivation to make My Little Pony: Remeber the Name
/me Remember*
/me turns his bookmark bar off
I have most of the 2nd verse thought out in my head
thats a neat trick
/me racks his brain
The addon does work, not sure if it should redirect to the page (ie. work like the bookmarklet) or display the link somewhere in the popup
"Got him out the dryer, he's hot" - Pinkie Pie getting ready for the gala - then a picture of Princess Luna when the "hot" part comes on :), Dat woona <3
'+escape(location.href)); seems so simple now i think about it
Also, I was asked for right click -> Shorten with derpy.me functionality over on dA
Diftraku: the muffin should go bright then notify you if it worked or errored
on linux it uses notifyd, i'l just test it in windows
It uses the same notifications that Firefox uses for notifying of updates
8,1Phase4: encodeURIComponent is better
Does anypony remember, wait... The Pandorica part 2
nevermind :P
or maybe "Let's Kill Hitler"
/me is trying to think of when 11th doctor had on the tux and was "rockin' the booth"
00,10You cant kill Hitler, tvtrops says so
Go back in time to kill Hitler, accidentally save hitler's life
:P
O.O
I JUST REALIZED SOMETHING!
My friend (teh beautiful awesome one, :)) has a friend named Mel
Mel - Melody
Phase4: If you could implement clientside rate limiting on the addon (1 link per minute) that'd tbe awesome
(Well, melony, but close)
Melody... pond...
Timelord (lady?)
:D
Diftraku: probably should, to fast and it errors with a '{}'
8,1Phase4: it works better when you're encoding a URI that has a URI in it
8,1i.e. it's more universal for GET parameters
wow, it doesnt minify at all. just dumps source right into the xpi
AMAZON! Y U SO GLITCHY???!
/me feels like watching some S6 of Doctor Whooves

TRUE!!
Dken2021: Well, I've seen it described this way: It sticks closely to the Pokemon formula for games, but it's the formula perfected. battles are fast paced and the idle animations keep it from feeling like nothing's happening. The story is probably the best/most engrossing of the franchise, and the poke designs are a lot better than Gen 4 IMO

My mamory of it is a bit fuzzy, since I was tired when i read it, maybe I will read it again but one thing that felt a bit off:
attempt to work interupted by otakon
otakon: you missed a bunch of people you dont know making this chat a much more confusing place
your mamory?

http://www.youtu.be/CH4w7UZV3NA
So the one thing I remeber is when you set up the 1500 pound warrior, you note that "Quin often thought how terrible a conversationist he was" on conrtast to his sheer physical power
thank you again
great I divided into two
haha eman
wait, otakon impersonated someone?
I'm sure I can improve
lol emantrollslayer

btw do you think that the makers meant to include that Fluttershy induendo?
clearly as good as the impersonations on Cupcake Time
It just feels out of place in the scenario and I thought maybe it would be better to set things like their social skills up in a chapter where they get to show them off
so it is that one
well
yeah I took that out
I wouldn't go that far
otakon: not quite discord but your voice is awesome
