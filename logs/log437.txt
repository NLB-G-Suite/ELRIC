so i was thinking today...
/me goes back to the fireplace and curls up with Shizuka again, muttering something about being woken up by tests
I'd like to see Spike masturbate his cute little dragon penis until its dripping wet with precum, and then have him stick it inside of Big Macintosh's penis sheath and jack off feverously until he fills up Big Mac's cock pouch like a twinkie. Spike could pull out and watch Big Macintosh become erect as his growing member glistens with Spike's warm sperm. Spike could then jack off Big
Macintosh fast with both hands until Big Mac sprays Spike's face and body down with cum, it would be like a semen fire hose.
Dafuq?
That wall
I recognize it
Same person came here a few days ago, and said exactly that :l
That's inappropriate
:I
can you imagine if Big Macintosh blew his load onto Spike, especially if he saved it up for a few days?
yeah, and got banned I think
I know :(
Spike would be drowning in sperm
Slurreh banned him
its probably not the exact same paragraph, i rewrote it an hour ago :)
._.
and i added the part about the semen fire hose
/me calls in the hit squad
And im sure you had so much fun
HELLO GHOSTIES
oh i did
How art thou?
04Thou art tired
Hellow!
:(
04Thou is also apparently the only mod on at this hour
Ghosties!
/me needs to l2stream
Hey Ghosties!
04Yo
do you prefer Spike having 1 or 2 penises?
I think he looks cuter with just 1
What the fuq
I don't even
Why would he have two anyway?
I never understood that.
Monfang_: some lizards do have two.
Why?
Ghosties, I haven't seen you for a while.
Meh, doesn't matter.
Monfang_: ask that to evolution, I guess
http://tinyurl.com/79lbf8f
OH GOD
WHY DID I CLICK THAT LINK
I don't even want to click that
WHHHYY
Knowing what he has been pasting
04People please don't click the links
Ghosties, couldn't you ban him?
iLoveSpike was kicked from the room by Ghosties. (GOODSIR, I SAY GOOD DAY TO YOU)
he just did >_>
Okay, but I mean "ban ban".
He /did/
HAHAHAHAHAHA I've seen worse. No really, I've seen worse.
He did
[04:17:49] * Ghosties sets mode: +b *!*@75.10.vgj.nxv
^ that
04inb4 he ban evades
04Again
lol
if he does
That would be just saaaaad
call on MakerDusk to k-line 'em
Okay. Well, who's going to watch season 3, when it comes out..? I know I sure am.
I might not
/me shrugs
Why Rain?
Who won't?
I'm going to watch Dan vs. in the MLP off-season.
Depends on my schedule.
because I am slowly loosing intrest in the show
I have school when Season 3 comes out.
Yeah, sometimes life is just hard..
04Wow
04It's weird being in the chat at this hour
wft?
I just finished my homework, due tomorrow.
04It's so quiet
^
04Almost reminds me of last summer
^
Mmhhmm
It has been like this a few nights in a row
04Well, fortunately, this is how things typically are when it comes to mods and shifts
because the season ended (thank god)
04For all this summer I'll be up until like 7 AM in the morning, at least until another mods comes on
Yeah, atleast we won't have as many people as we did when the Canterlot Wedding was on.
Im back
04WELCOME BACK
04I AM YOUR GOD HERE
Hello!
04WELCOME TO BRONYSTATE
implying BS getting 5k people on is a regular occourance
/me lurks in shadows of the chat
04WE HAVE A DELICIOUS BUFFET OF STUFF
back from the dairy
define stuff.
04Nails and shrimp
Ghosties, can I post a funny video about a turtle that explodes and says "Hello!"?
mmmm
Nails
/me sneaks to the table
04Haha
04By the way, XAX, we had over 12,000 unique IPs hitting ponychat for the season 2 finale
Oh mai
04So while 5K is a bit too idealistic at this time, I don't think it'd be too much of a dream to hope for
Well done :D
Brony State ish best Streamer
Man, I loved the songs.
Oh yeah, I looked at that ip map
No dot over my town :(
Ohai everypony.
Hello.
I connected like... 2 minutes before the Finale though
I'll post the vid.
FFUUUU dam mine
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCnj-uiRCn8
WOW my teamate just crashed the Viper
sure is hectic in here
Gmorning everypony~
Hello Starflash, here it is 7:30 P.M
"Everypony" is about 6 people at the moment, Starflash.
04^
And hello :)
ok, good evening Emerald_Chocolate :D
04It's quiet here
04Even though there's 94 people on
Yes, indeed Ghosties.
It's quite, to quite.
Lurkers, Lurkers everywhere :3
quite :o
I remember fondly, the times when there were 50 people idling and maybe 4 active chatters
Quiet*
Yes..
Stop reminiscing Rain. You make me regret not becoming a brony sooner :(
Lol
04Pfft
^
04I can go back even farther
^
Wow Battlefield 3 is making me mad, Im geeting off the game
I'm watching the Nostalgia Critic...
wasnt there a time when you litterally were the chat, Ghosties?
Ghosties: The First Brony: the movie
Me to. I can remember the times when there wer 1000000 people chatting..
dun dun dunn
04I remember on most nights when there'd be 2 people (including myself) in the chat during the night, and every time someone would come in I'd scream "I AM YOUR GOD HERE!" at them. Good times, good times
/me thinks silently to self
...wow.
yup
haha Ghosties
Dat free time./
04But that was in the very beginning
04Like in May of 2011
2 people Connected, Ghosties?
Ghosties is a ghost for a reason
04Yep
._.
when did bronystate get linked from eqd?
he died of old age
Mai gawd
Oh, poor Ghosties.
/me thinks about logging onto Aion.
lol didnt you do that to me earlier Ghosties
ewww
eqd
How did I get here again... oh, thats right. I google'd "Brony chatroom" <_>
04We'd always have a way to contact EqD, but we had help with Hipster_Brony at the time
et voila.
04I did, I did scream my phrase again earlier but I don't remember at who...
Me
04Ah, well
04There you go :P
BronyinJapan
thats who
Feel special, BronyinJapan.
Hello
Ghosties, have you seen "TopHat" Lately?
Rain what wrong with EQ Daily? it's my main source for ponies
*what's
04*ever*
04Ande no, Emerald, I haven't seen him/her :/
XAX Yes Ive been yelled at by a god
Exactly Ghosties...
I was looking for a live stream of the episodes. And even if bronystate was buffering and failing constantly so I often had to watch elsewhere, the community was the largest
Mutterguy_, nothing ^_^
you keep liking it
Ghosties: i heard after the stream in the early days the mods would go into a free for all kick all the other mods off to be the last one in the chat
>Ghosties talks >all the lurkers start talking.
I first heard about bronystate in Ballad of the Brony :(
04Mhm
04That's true, Shane
once you stop liking eqd, you know you are slowly starting to dislike the fandom ^_^
04For fun the mods would kick one another all the time
XAX Same here
oooooh
04Ballad of the Brony?
04Wut dat
Fan documentary
Ghosties: wow really what ended that fun?
04We were mentioned elsewhere?
:O
On bronies
04Wuuuuuuuuuut
It's an hour long
:D
04There was a fan documentary, and we were in it?
04Link please
really where
The site was mentioned, yes.
ye link it
I wish all my other bronies and ponies were here..
NAO XAX
YouTube search it >: ( I'm on my iPod
Ghosties: have u seen this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJ1dYrjuYf4&feature=related
your other bronies and ponies?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE7I_IDX98g
My little bronies! I used to wonder what friendship could be!
when you say ponies, what do you mean, Emerald_Chocolate?
Ghosties here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE7I_IDX98g
Emerald_Chocolate: then u became a brony
Female bronies of course.
NO
that is not cool
04Huh, interesting
I'm a female.
/me winced at that
as am I
04Don't think I'll sit through the whole thing
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4826/
04But I'll definitely keep it in mind
Ghosties: lol my link or XAX s?
I find it stupid to give different names based on gende
r
it makes the fandom look like two different parts
Shane377: BronyinJapan's :p
which it's not
Shane377 Mine
XAX: ahh k
Ghosties: did u see my link
>__>
04I saw both links but typed it in myself
Anywho, Rain, what has your favourite part of MlP FIM been?
hmm
LOL wtf is with that Nigel meme, its sooo funny :D
I was going to say the community, but that has started to fade for me
04Oh yeah, some female fans call themselves 'pegasisters'
ewwwwww
Das silly
04Nothing wrong with that in my mind
Ghosties: yea same
Just a name.
I know, but it just makes it look like a different fandom
haha i kno BronyinJapan
BronyinJapan: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qwRbOm2Pvg
/me is all about equallity of the sexes
Pegasi, Unicorns, Earth ponies, Princess Celestias twins, what else is new?
as in, giving a different name just because of gender just doesnt sit right with me :\
besides, Im pretty bro :p
As am I.
/me read that as "I'm pretty, bro"
:(
lol
Im not a narsacist
:p
Look rain,Males should have a males name, and Females should have a females name
Just sayin
I know a guy named Sue and a girl named Henry
Love it how 92 people are on but only like 6 ponies are chatting
04You know a girl named "Henry?"
Rain: wow
That's fine.
lol
Ghosties: theres girls called henri which is short for henriette
Bronies and pegasisters would make sense if Bronydom was modelled on the Catholic Church...
I know a girl calle jack and a boy called lucy.
hmm. Dat documentary is pretty cool oO
04Ah, that makes more sense
Mutterguy lol right
/me 's middle name is "Allen" >_>
WAT
yup
/me FLIPS TABLE
this is MADNESS!
Allen. That is a female and males name. Heard of Ellen Degeneres
but thats el en
L N
04Ellen Page is so cute
Well, I might see yall later.
That lesbian? Yes, I have heard of that pretty lady :3
04See ya, Emerald
allen is pronounced AL Len
bai Emerald_Chocolate
Ellen is awesome, btw
c you Ghosties, Rain, Shane < Brony in japan and any other ponies!
bye

Finding nemo >.>

Ellen > Oprah
meh, I go back to my corner
/me curls up next to her bf and tries to fall asleep again
Hiya
04Bye Emerald
04Hello new person
^ lol
Hello old mod
04...who are you
Ghosties HE IS YOUR GOD NOW
Just your friendly neighbourhood RainbowAsh
04I don't buy that
04Have you been around here before?
maybe he just realizes that any "new" mods to him are probably old mods
BronyinJapan: i dont kno why but i am actually watch that doc
lol
even tho if seen it like 4 times
even tho ive seen it 4 times*
Are you really talking to me?
Shane377 Ive seen it 8 times:P
I have ballad of the brony saved to my PC ^_^
lol 6_9 :p
04Yeah, Ash
It's in the same folder I keep the MLP eps in
XAX Cool
Yes, I have been here quite regularly since around the middle of season 2.
04Hmm, interesting
/me shrugs
04Welcome back
anyone else have at the gala stuck in their head
Thanks. ^^
nope
Love how they put Minecraft on the Xbox 360
04No problem
First episode stream I watched was Dragon Quest, but I was coming regularly about a week or 2 before that
:(
First episode stream I watched was season 2 ep 1
/me was too late to the party
but first time I was here was week 23 of BMN
First episode stream I watched was Green Isn't Your Color. Not on Bronystate, though.
XAX nah we're just early for NEXT season!
:o
haha np RainbowAsh
Babes in Toyland
Oh lord
boy, that was a fun movie night
Why did that get WMC?
Because it ended about 2 hours after everyone wanted it to
Lol
also, it /created/ the WMC
Think mine was Season 2 EP 15
How long is it? :o
04Too long
too damn long
04Babes in Toyland is horrible
^
04Probably the worst film I've seen here
^
04And yes, like Rain said, it created the WMC
the entire chat agreed aswell
LOL Wish I was there to see it
04No you don't >>
no, never wish that
04It was terribad
oh.
:P lol
guys go to 35 minutes and watch for a minute in this vid http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE7I_IDX98g
it was so horrible that I almost turned away from this site
I found Bronystate in the documentary. woohoo
i loled so hard at 35:13
eeyup.
/me became a brony after reading Cupcakes
/me sighs
XAX: really?
04Where Starflash?
04What time?
I'm srs. It was the first MLP related content I ever looked at
XAX LOL Cupcakes is what led me to watch the show
voluntarily
Wait a sec...
04Okay
48:50
BronyinJapan: /)
/me hugs everypony :3
XAX: my condolescences..
(\
/me hugs everypony :3
Starflash: in the documentary?
yeah
/me Hugs back
Its like people said already, just a reference though.
Still cool
04Success, thanks for that
For me it was youtube poops though so I'n on the same boat :D
Sure thing~
04Pretty neat that he mentioned us, kinda wish he would have said something outside the documentary to one of us :I
:I
Hai everybrony
Ohai CountDoofus
You mean told you that he made a reference? meh
#JustinBieberForCandyCuties2012 is trending on Twitter :I
Hi CountDoofus
What.
40:23 in the documentary
04Well yeah, it would have been neat if he had said something to one of us so we'd know
04But still, it's awesome how he mentioned us alongside only EqD and Ponychan
lol This video crackes me up http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zqlVJNsI4o
when did he mention us in the doc?
48:50 or so
That's how awesome this site is Ghosties!
/me is cold
04Thanks, we try :)
oh btws
mofuking winter
Anypony seen Hackers last night?
/me Gives XAX a blacket
I went to bed after Bueller
I wish I could have got up to watch it
The anniversary movie nights start at 6am here
-_-
I was in school:'(
Oh btw, Ghosties, thx for Pi :3 thats just cool.
Starflash: me too
04Oh, hey, no problem :D
Everyone ready for some spaghetti western tonight? (Kurosawa will sue)
04I was planning on changing it if the viewers didn't like Requiem for a Dream too much but it appears that most people really enjoyed the film
Ok
Ghosties: is Pi equally depressing?
Ghosties: Your chat commentary during movie nights make them so much funnier ^_^ Thanks
Just wondering which The Wall you guys will show. There are a lot of The Wall's.
The Pink Floyd one I think
Ghosties: what were u playing on changing it to?
MaidSurge, I love myself a good spagetti western
MaidSurge: Pi isn't really depressing, rather thrilling
so it's rather a connection of emotional weight, I guess
RainbowAsh: my mom hates them, I don't mind them :)
MaidSurge: u mum h8 ponies/
?
My mom hates spaghetti western
Or western in general
what do you guys mean with spaghetti.
MaidSurge, I was about to say that I don't understand how someone can dislike an entire genre, but then again, Romantic Comedies.
oh lawd
Starflash, because they are filmed mostly in Italy
oo ok.
Dat stereotypical naming
i heard the part about colgate
lol she was named that cause her mane loooked like toothpaste
ehm.. yeah
I'm iffy about romantic comedies too, unless they're something like Shaun of the Dead :D
why did you think :P
I watched Ballad of the Brony before i ever watched an episode of the show
Imma get off, bye everypony;)
XAX: were you impressed?
MaidSurge, I wouldn't put Shaun of the Dead in that category, though
So when I finally did, I sat there saying "OH LOOK, THERE'S THAT BACKGROUND PONY BALLAD OF THE BRONY WAS TALKING ABOUT"
MaidSurge: Mmm
It's a mix of zombie movies and romantic guwaffing, really
04<Shane377> Ghosties: what were u playing on changing it to? <-- Probably Shawshank Redemption
ahh k
04<XAX> Ghosties: Your chat commentary during movie nights make them so much funnier ^_^ Thanks <-- I appreciate the compliment :)
We need to put Fargo or The Big Lebowski as movie night candidates
I'll probably only be able to catch Friday's anniversary movies (Friday 2 pm in the states is Saturday 6am here)
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4826/
Good guy Ghosties > reacting to old comments he missed~
MaidSurge, true, but, strange as it sounds, it isn't as shallow as most mainstream romantic comedies. Also everything is better with zombies. And bromance.
XAX: where do you live?
MaidSurge: New Zulund
yeah yeah, *Zealand. I know.
RainbowAsh: Ikr :) that's how most comedies should be, zombies or not
and MaidSurge maid time is over
XAX: I'm a master of typos, so I won't say anything
I LOOK GOOD IN THIS SO I WON'T TAKE IT OFF
MaidSurge, yrah, there are too many movies that just don't care about characters and messages.
I only accept shallowness as a parody
hello there everybody :)
04Hello new person
probably only knew to you, Ghosties
:p
Hai Candy_Mane
new*
Hai Candy_Mane
Even in parodies I find shallowness sometimes grating, especially if it's attempted to make it the only trait of a character. It's just been done to death and the parody often isn't that different from what 'serious' movies contain.
ugh. mfw I missed like 4 out of 6 of them nominated B movies. =w= I should come here more often
04Indeed, I suppose Candy_Mane is new to me :P
God, someone donated $10,000 to that bronycon documentary project...?
You should Starflash :3c
Hey Rain! :>
But but but I was so busy T_T
/me hugs Rain
/me hugs back
Hey Starflash.
Sorry, but I'll keep that little money I have with me (if there's no big charity involved)
MaidSurge,
well not really but ...
04Oh hey, the chatroom is alive again
2O_o
ikr~
2I like this nick
Who?
Ghosties: YAY
What RainbowAsh?
04YOU KNOW WHO, YOU BRITISH ASSCLOWN
MaidSurge, as long as you don't have money, like me, that's ok. But there are also fans out there that do have some disposable income and it comes quite natural to spend it on what they like.
Trolololo. (:
MaidSurge, sorry, I spoke too soon before. ^^;
04Oh, Dari
i has prove
04Dude
04have you been around lately?
I still don't have an income :(
Nope, exams
Taking a break today though
04Wow
04You missed it
It?
04In the midst of our anniversary weekend, Silverscreen returned
Wow
04And he rejoined the team
HAH, that's AWESOME
04I KNOW RIGHT
04I knew you'd be stoked to see him back :D
Rebuilding the OG team! :D
04I know :)
04Except Hipster hasn't returned any of my messages >_<
:<
04Yeah, I know
04But still, almost all of the original crew is here
04You should definitely hang out Friday, Silverscreen will be around for BMN
02derp
What is this, +m?
Why is nobody else talking? XD
Nah, the rest of the room is lettin em reminiscence for a bit.
I'll definitely turn up if I can
MaidSurge, keep looking, I am sure something will turn up for you eventually. ^^
Im all for that, but still
04Awesome man, I look forward to some classic BronyState :>
woohoo~
04He even brought back his RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA too XD
Now all we need is some Battlefield Leverage.
ohhh. That was silverscreen?
Hahaha, damn I've missed his movie trivia
04Speaking of that, I'm incredibly disappointed that Battlefield Leverage didn't even make Best B film nomination
cool.
What
04Seriously
Fuck leverage, we require more vespene gas!
04It didn't make it
But it's the best film we've ever shown
04I know
04I know
04Leverage didn't even win best meme :(
Damn, I am disappointed.
Sea ponies won
What was the leverage thing again? <.<
...
04...
Clearly too many new members Ghosties, not enough OG who remember the good times.
04Too true
/me remembers
04I miss how things were
so does pepridge farm
04It was such an awesome night
Yeah, I'm with you there...
Oh don't make me feel bad :'(
So, whats it then =w= sorry for only being here for 7-8 months
04I counted how many times Leverage was said and then at the climax of the film everybody started RPing with the film and saying leverage all over the place XD
04Like it was one big damn warfield in chat
Virtually every single comment during the whole film was about leverage
Herp
/me remembers bowing down to the Bowie crotch
Leverage was said > 1000 times
Not enough leverage?
It was just amazing
04NEVER ENOUGH LEVERAGE
04Red Leverage, reporting
Oh damn, I just remembered pizzacake as well. XD
PIZZACAKEPIZZACAKEPIZZACAKE
04Pizzacake?
04>feels bad he doesn't know what Dari's talking about
I think Rain is really the only old timer
._.
04@Mutterguy: I hope you're only talking about viewerwise
04Because I've been here since the very first Movie night
mfw older people calling me new and shit. =w=
oh wells.
of course!
/me nods
But where was Gondor when we required more leverage?
04Eh, don't take too much offense Starflash
Naw, I just wanna see BF earth right now :D
*throws railings into the mix*
04This kinda happens when two or more people of the original team get together
how many weeks has BMN ran so far?
one simplly doesn't walk into Mordor, they take the bus!
Ty, it was because all the humans kept shouting pice of cake. :P
because I came in at weak 23
CountDoofus: you saw that railing animation last night?
piece*
04OH GOD
That was simply awesome.
04YOU MEAN WHEN THAT WAS LIKE THEIR FIRST WORDS
04THAT THEY LEARNED
Wasn't here last light, so nope, sadly :(
Yeah!
PIZZACAKE PIZZACAKE
aw ok :T
04XDDD Fucking hilarious!
Piece of cake
04Man, shit, we gotta show Battlefield Leverage again
/me has bussed across 'The Desert' where Mordor was set
light? night*
Evil Dead 2 needs a restream as well.
04Speaking on that...
04Oh, I can't say anything :I
Anyways (I believe it was Luna?) there was a pony animation about the necessity of railings.
Had a busy week thus far, haven't been able to catch any movie :'(
Is it just me, or the films we streamed back then were so much more awesome?
almost gave something away, Ghosties. you need to be more careful :p
We got memes out of the films every week
04Times were different
04To be fair we got a meme out of a movie on Monday
OH GOD, now I'm thinking about FLOOT and barrels.
04...though you'll never guess which one
..Meanwhile still gets memes out of films every week though
04OH
04AND
04DUDE
04speaking of FLOOT and barrels
04We're showing A Fistful of Dollars today
HAHA, AWESOME
So much nostalgia.
Meme outta the movies on Monday?
You mean Sumerpan?
All this Battlefield talk and no "when you were learning how to SPELL YOUR NAME"
04Yeah
This happens every time we talk Ty. XD
Well yeah.
04Since we showed it on Monday
04Nittany accidentally called him 'Sumerpan'
Lawl
04And I immediately started noticing how awesome it was
04So I called attention to it
And then someone made a poster about Sumerpan - The warrior of Bronystate.
04We got a new pic and a new drawing out of it :D
Sumerpan is an awesome name.
Hahaha. XD
04But man, I expect you to be there for a restream of Battlefield Leverage
Oh, don't worry, I wouldn't miss it for anything.
Ferris Bueller should be "Ferris Bufferin's day off"
Were you there Ghosties?
Although, MaidSurge, the "So much bufferiiiiiiing" doesnt count as a meme
Plus we already have a better buffering pic out of the iron giant :D
02:3
We got a few new pics out of the movie though, courtesy of Meanwhile
And a new "haha! time for ponies" pic
Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!
04Awesome Dari :D
04Was I there for what, MaidSurge?
INB4 BronyState worst movie night with Epic Movie, Spider's Web, and Babe's in Toyland.
04NO
:D
For Ferris Bueller
04We can't do that :O
04It's against the rule
Thank god.
Rules were made to be broken.
04Oh, for Bueller? Nope ><
04There's no way in hell we'd show those three films again
One day...
SOON.jpg
Showing horrible movies is against the rules?
04Least of all fucking Babes in Toyland
suddenly ALL the wc's...
04Oh man, SOON.jpg
04...you just made me think of Bjornfot
04I miss Bjornfot :(
At least Spider's Web isn't WMCed.
Nya
Haha, that crazy bastard.
02hi
Bjornfort is best fort.
04Yes he is
04Man I miss him
04And his crazy eggface pictures
LOL
THE EGGFACE
I'd completely forgotten that.
XD
what is going OOOOOOOON!?
AHAHAHAHAHA
04You forgot eggface?!
04What's wrong with you, man?! :O
I know, I'm ashamed. XD
*came too late to Bronystate to understand the references :'( *
You scare me ghosties
aww MaidSurge :<
But he hasn't been here for so long, I haven't seen it in ages
04Ah, don't mind me I'm just reminiscing
04Yeah, I know ._.
since when were you here anyways?
04He isn't around anymore
Who isnt around?
Damn, we need some Gokaiger and shit, I swear.
Starflash: since Read It And Weep
04Old viewer by the name of Bjornfot
Sound the DCD call!
oh. ehmm
04Resident BronyState viking
Haha, yeah
brb.
MaidSurge: you caught the Railing meme, right? :T
You mean before Wrek?
I think so
irc... blowing itself up and shit
Hey, Ty.
I just realised we missed something out of our reminiscing.
hai everybody
Hey EpicPwnTime3
Ghosties - you should add Ty to your highlight list so I can type that to get your attention
:P
the stream still isnt working?
its not that it isnt working
its that nobody is streaming
the streamers are sleeping
Hai EpicPwnTime3
04Oh, no, I saw you I was just in the kitchen :P
I dunno, I think I saw Wrek in Skype, so he might come on and stream soon
04But what did we leave out?
ooooohhh
Ahh.
Ghosties: http://instantbutton.me/buttons/ds2_20110710044121.html
riiiight
BWEEEEEEEEEEUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Huh? Wha.....o_o
04Death Stalkerrrrrrrr
04>yfw I didn't even have to open the link to know what you were referring to :D
XD
04That was another good film with over the top sound effects
04But I love how Death Stalker made womanizing acceptable in that film XD
That is just an odd sentance.
Lawl, and of course there was Super Mario Bros. as well. XD
DO YOU EAT?!
back
A BOB-OMB?
So no stream?
Currently, no
04Haha, yeah I remember that one
04Too bad no one on the team didn't
Good i can have some tracks in the BG
Blah, most of the team didn't see the movies we remember as the best. :/
04Yeah, I know what you mean
04But some good times can be made now
Yeah
04Sumerpan happened and that was with the current team :P
Heheh
Ok, BBL, going out for a bit.
04Alright man, see ya
I'm okay with already streamed movies making a comeback, especially Battlefield Earth :D
Y NO Who Framed Roger Rabbit?
Im browsing google maps for some f'ed up s.
Propose that for next week's stream
I would if I'd get a newsletter. For some reason, I stopped getting it.
04Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a great film too
^
04And Doofus have you checked your spam? The newsletters like to appear there
One of my childhood favorites, alongside Beetlejuice.
And yep.
04In that case contact fluttercry, Val, or SuperBrony when they come on
Sure thing, thanks :)
04No problem
brb

Hey does anyone have a link to the bronystate group pic?
Texas is indeed big.

We've got a construction job in Odessa - thats an 8 hour drive from houston
TheRandomkid321: Is the link above what you were talking about?
Yes
there still aren't any hacks for the stupid Nano 4G
I want rockbox or something decent on there
Now there needs to be a drawing of all the ponies who visit bronystate.
Well... it remains to be seen, then. I'm visiting a friend in Amarillo, and I don't want him to feel snubbed if I decide to cut my visit short with 3 days, plus I've also paid for a hotel room I won't be using for 3 days.
Who is this Diftaku person?
lol. Visit? That would be tough
Alll i can hear now is BLARGRYGYRGRHG DAMN YOU NIGEL THORNBERRY!
CountDoofus|ME3: :) That's alright - Don't forget to get some Blue Bell ice cream while your here, start with vanilla
TheRandomkid321: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpNoJPxJtCU&feature=related
hmm. I'm still debating if when I finish my fanfic whether to pour it all on the site or do something fun and upload it a chapter per day
Please stream "Last roundup" this sunday morning at 8/7c so we can all see if derpy was resureccted by the power of love.
I'm craving some KFC, actually, but Blue Bell vanilla ice cream sounds good for dessert :)
It's 8:15 pm here, which was the former airtime of Regular show.
I can't believe I lost 15 pounds
/me hugs Shane377
flutter_spin: good for you!
/me gives VioletGreySha a hug

http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/01/ponies-perfect-for-travel.html

Well, whenever she cooks a meal, she makes enough to last 4 days
a soldier died in the field of battle and came up to the gates of heaven,where he met god. He said to god,"Lord,i know i did many things im not proud of,and many more you wouldnt approve of,so if you send me to hell,i wont argue. god stood there for a moment,then turned to the gatekeeper. "let him in", he said. the gatekeeper,confused,asked why. god looked down at the soldier and said,"this man just came from hell."
its funny when everyone takes teh time to read such a textwall xD

He means Saturday.
His rythm matches teh level of superbronies.

Saturday they're doing a mare-athon of some popular episodes.

Litwick: Actually, It is coming sunday morning at 8:04 am.

i thought last round up was shown before premier of the finale, and derpy was edited version
Oh celesti
you kno u can die doing this
and then you die
/me checks the hub schedule.
CINNAMON CHALLENGE
Yeah. You can die.
8:04? Yeah that is a lie.
You could only die if you inhaled it.
ORLLY shane?
Which would be kind of stupid
Hahaha
I LOVE DIS CHICK!
Glozell, my sister showed me this video
XD
a ladle istead os a teaspoon.
8:04 is because the scene itself does not begin until then. The four minutes before that is the intro, ads, etc.
Good news story
8:00 EST is too early for an episode.
is it good if u have a big heart?
To a point, but too big is bad
Ironman
Litwick: It's not a new episode, it's a rerun of episode 214.
isnt it
not if itd to big
depends on what you mean by it
Gotcha.

Oh, this fandom.
>complains about cloppers >bronies is about accepting people despite who they are
Wat.
Yes!
What's the name of the video
This is like Pony Thread Simulator 4.2.
WAT!
...
Poor Dash
Damn this is messed up
LOL
Seriously. Bitching about cloppers when you're a brony is ridiculous.
sooooooooooooooooooo Wrong!
0.o
this is actually messed up
WROOOOOOOOOONG
9.51 am BST (Bronystate Time) now.
Why isn't there a seperate Internet for those ppl ...
Ok: beware an incoming rant from me.
NOVA
Dat Ghost.
Wat.
So much for love and tolerence....
NOVA is that u

it was nova
I saw a video of the guy saying GOD DAMMIT
Why...
This is so many kinds of funny.

i don't want to know the title anymote
/me cries.
/me shudders
anymore*
LOL!!!
Bitching about cloppers when you're a brony is retarded beyond beleif and eliminates the sole purpose of bronies.
ShiningArmor: It sounded like Ghost from True Capitalist Radio to me.
Thank god I muted before it said *censored*.
Wait who r we watching click videos
ok just talking
i dont want to live on this planet anymore....
THIS WAS.........shocking
I agree with Litwick
AND THAT'S MY EVERYDAY FOLKS!!
Oh yes.
Clash.
yay ^_^
yay
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJ6gC_4q9tg
It's back to the better part of the fandom! :D
Bleh, too many requests.
Litwick: I agree. I myself don't "clop", but I don't have a problem with people who do. I've spent enough time on the Internet to see worse things.
By being a brony, you accept people into your fandom for who they are, regardless of what they do. Insulting cloppers because of who they are AS broies is EXTREMELY hypocritical.
R we watching people here click videos o-o?
Glad to get that off my chest.
I love Clash, though I wish I could understand what the hay they're saying.
It loops
OOPS! My baaaaad
aww
derpy
DERPY!!!
Clash

Lol...
o_o
i think next one is mine
GIIIIIIILLLLLLLDAAAAAAAAAASSSSSHHHHH YOU'RE LATE!!!!
Seriously, you guys can make anything funny.
This was my request.

I can whistle.....
Just gunna play a few more videos, then I'm done with requests.
I got a freaking add saying "Click to download!" God i hate ads
yea mines next
I can't whistle for my life.
Litwick: I always thought that if you see rule 34 of ponies it's pretty much your fault because you wandered off in the weird part of the fandom :D

I was right
/me shrugs
0,5If any of you wonder who my best ship is
0,5Don't.
10Challenge accepted?
0,5Everyone knows that I have a secret alternate universe ship with everybody I meet
Warning considered
LordCelestia's banana x ScootaJailbait
LordCelestia: According to the theory of the multiverse, I suppose that'd always be true.
LordCelestia: I don't care about any shipping, so I won't care about yours either
0,5x3
0,5by state, so the age at which a person can be considered "jailbait' varies.
wat
0,5So THATS what it means.....
10... you didn't know?
You didn't know?
I always thought it meant something different.
0,5Not completely
10get out of my head!
That's why Scootachicken is jailbait.
10^
I thought it meant someone who was above the legal age of consent, but looked younger.
10the opposite :D
0,5I actually thought it meant someone who gets raped in jail a lot and loves it
wat
10O________________________________O
xD
If you think about the word, it makes sense.
Wow
...
Jail...Bait...
0,5Which is why I thought Scootachicken was jailbait
Lol, LordCelestia
Old people in a nutshell
Because you are younger than you look.
LC, if you ship me, I'm voting for Luna.
10indeed, and you're like bait for jailtime :D
0,5Huh
I'm no jaibait
And I'm always in your head Olly.
:P
3heheheh x3
0,5I knew it meant a young sexual person, but I didnt know the exact words for it
scotaloo is jailbait indeed
Not Scootaloo.
Scootachicken.
:P
NO she no Chicken :[
LordCelestia, this explains SO MUCH
What's this about best mod?
Not a clue
RainBowJack: No no, the person on BronyState named Scootachicken.

your just messed up
how's it going dari?

Om: What you did not?! o.o
I really don't like it when stories for children are "dumbed down" for their audience. Okay, so young children don't all know how to read. So do we fill all of their entertainment that doesn't challenge them? Do we treat that time in their life as a disability that has to be accomodated?
Can anyine speak Swedish in here to translate this?
Airpuff: Not much
lolwut
Litwick it isnt sweedish =O
Or wait

You just got CLINT'D.

Calcos323: What about Weird Al Yan- wait...
Airpuff: You're a coffin maker and a hearse wagon driver!

Om: You say that like it's a bad thing. :D
whenever you say SlurryMoon, it emits a yay
00,03Was it a Liberty Gun?
East Clintwood :3
I don't think it was even a real gun
*walks back in* What's going on now?
LilB: gatlings use 5 to 6 rotating barrels. this thing had 20 barrels and nothing rotating
GilDash: You could tell could you.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim_gun
fluttercry Know that you mention it... I remember reading about that
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volley_gun
But that's false alarm, as it always makes me think it's Sumica
It wasn't a Maxim or a Volley gun
OH YEAH

Dark_Horst: But it doesn't fire like a volley gun
let's just agree on the regisseur having derped hard
3^Sumerpan
/me kisses Om.
Sumerpan is best hero
Om: You're forgiven. :)
Man, I'm really not following this story very well.
He is not the hero BronyState needs.
Midnight_Fyre: course it didnt. the guy who wanted this in the movie appearantly didnt do his homework. it looked liek a volley gun and behaved like a browning
05,15Kandarihu he's playing both sides of the conflict for money. He works for both crime lords
Shaddap Kammerjunk, you're ruining the moment
Kandarihu: Westerns have story beyond honour and shootings?
GilDash: That didn't make me feel forgiven.
Very_Silly_Filly: Sorry D:
I'm sorry, I was harsh :c
Okay. Thanks
/me hugs GilDash
/me likes this film
Hmm... it looked like a volley gun, but fired more like a gatling or maxim... in other words it's movie convention.
/me spins and explodes
GilDash: Ha ha ha. Story.
Very_Silly_Filly: wat
the story in this is actually quite nice..if lifted directly from another movie
inb4 Troll_manwithnoname
Om: Believe me, if you weren't forgiven the punishment would be *much* more severe. ;)
Yes, Terry. Mine for BRAINS!
/me hugs alexxm.
GilDash of course they have! Just like Japanese movies have more then just Honour and Samurais
Clint Eastwood is going to be troll
GilDash: So you admit it was a punishment.
LilB: ... Oh course...
HAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHA THATs so funny...
/me laughs maniacally.
(Was previously TheSonicdude97)
WAHAHAHAHAahahahahahahaha. Okaym lets do this.
i dont get it :/
05,15red_ony2 yeah Sergio Leone admits that this is a remake of Yojimbo. But the other two of the series are also very good and those are original stories
Om: Maybeee... Keep asking and you'll get another. ;)
........
he had to pay royalties as well imo
for zthis movie
/me brushes Om's mane.
Another what? Can I haz? :3
e_o
Om: Your hair is all tangled...
Fun Fact: There was another remake of this story also with Bruce Wilis in the 20s or 30s, but nobody cares about that one
^
GilDash: Its wavy, its gets that way.
whats it called Midnight_Fyre
fluttercry it's funny another western (whos name i can't recall) is also just a Western version of The Seven Samurai, the smae director who made Yojimbo
alexxm: Last Boy Scout
alexxm: Last Man Standing
Om: Don't worry, I'll straighten y-it out. ;)
05,15Yup. The Magnificent Seven
>_<
i was thinkiung abput that myself just now..thats it!
Last Boy Scout is something else
thanks SirGanjalf and Midnight_Fyre
Om: Brushie, brushie, brushie... :)
The remake of the Seven Samuraio was called "The Magficent Seven"-- which oddly enough was Kurosawa's first choice of titles for HIS movie.
i'm gonna go now. bye
cya Flutters
Have fun, Flutters.
I'm back
Flutters: See ya! :)
GilDash: Stop that, its imposible to hate brussies!

They're alive!
05,15MaidSurge yes. yes I do
PrincessLuna: Certe.
DUN DUN DUN
Kammerjunk: :O
11,01We're going to have fun with them!
Fun Fact: Kurosawa got started by making propaganda movies during WWII. They were OK, but not as good as his later stuff
Google is retardedly slow today
And then: RDR Undead Nightmare
thepiratebay is blazingly fast today
Rashomon is my favourite kurasawa
PrincessLuna: Qui? ._.
simple and brilliant
I heard they were under a ddos attack a few hours ago, Tovler|Twibfm
Et "quod".
Seven Samurai was the first Kurosawa film I saw. It's also my favorite
Kammerjunk: Where's you other one? The upside-downy one?
02*WB03(Ray03)02WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
05,15Fun Fact: RDR has 3 chapters, each based off of the different styles of westerns. Chapter1: Classic John Wayne, Chapter 2: Spaghetti Westerns, Chapter 3: New, gritty westerns
Midnight_Fyre mine too. Such an awesome movie
GilDash: Non intellego.
it is :)
fluttercry: Cool, I never noticed that while playing
Piratebay's been gone for over a day. That's all I know.
wat movie is this?
pirate bay's gone now?
So a Space Western would be out of the question for RDR orwhat?
*hops around the place randomnly*
Space Cowboys?
showing up late. fashionably.
What about acid western?
If I pick Seven Samurai for A movie would they play it, or would they not like the idea of a 3.5 hour black and white foreign film?
Cowboy Bebop?
^
Kammerjunk: Non comprehende? :D
IIRC, Outland, a "sapce western", was based on High Noon.
Kandarihu they had zombies, what's stoping them from that?
lol.

Om: Just like you don't believe me, but you'll learn... :)
I wonder if people would like 7 samurai..
*bops everypony lightly on the nose as he passes by*

Calcos323: Do it! That's my favorite movie of all time
GilDash: ^^ Heehee!

GilDash: Is that incentive?
I would love to watch The Hunger Games whenever the DVD comes out. meh. I don't believe anybody would want to stream it. x3

HORSES. LETS CALL THEM PONIES.
PONIES
Om: If you're incented, then by all means. ;)

Dohohoho.
*randomnly hugs PrincessLuna* Hai! :3
HELLOOO, what are we watching !?! SUP
preemptive yay
Midnight_Fyre, next movie should have been first choice
Midnight_Fyre: Because most people don't have good taste, unlike us

Midnight_Fyre: I don't want to see Clockwork Orange. But I wouldn't mind seeing Rashomon
Kammerjunk: can't wait :$
MaidSurge: I more or less know the entire album by heart ._.
clockwork pinkie!
Midnight_Fyre, I understand it's Sherlock Holmes, don't get me wrong, Clint is definetly a first choice movie, but for another day.
I have Clockwork Orange somewhere on my hard disk, but I've never watched it.
Kandarihu: It's a classic, a perfect character study
you should
Same here oO
I'm back! Again... :|
all the mod picks are A movies
I already sent my E-Mail for next Lottery with Citicen Kane and Metropolis as my Picks, but next time I'm gonna choose a real B movie XD
Kammerjunk: Watch it. It's amazing
SirGanjalf: :D
Kammerjunk: I don't but Pink Floyd are an immensely awesome band
the new restored version of metropolis`?
DitzyHooves, first choice I said :P

You guys should stream EDEN OF THE EAST
Resaluta itera!
PrincessLuna: You leave a lot.
its a good show
13DitzyHooves: except RHPS and Hackers
05,15LilB that's not how the Lottery works

MaidSurge: That they are.
Om: Sorry :( A friend of mine that was visiting from out of state just left
Om: You try to. ;)
HAckers was an A movie
Also I'd love to see my favourite Kubrick movie: FMJ

Very.

Yeah
GilDash: Soo >>

I dunno, it looked kinda cool
13do you ever sleep? :3
they all die so clean. no one pukes out his intestines or cries for his mother two hours long
yes ^_^
It ruined Spyro. :/
And shat on my childhood
I slept well, Shizu dear <3
Meh.
I didn't know so many people here had really good taste in movies! :D (no offence)
I would love to see Rescuers down under

/me hugs Midnight_Fyre for choosing nosferatu
derpy_pony: It's not Saving Private Ryan;)
/me hugs somepony_else back
I pick the 10th One Piece movie as my A Movie.
/me has no idea what Skylanders is. oO
ohai everypony
/me checks her skype for her last message sent
Has anybody here seen Felidae? Probably too gory to show here but just a random question.. I was just curious considering it's not that well known.
hi Jim
Eventually they're all just going to be laying on the stomachs reading comics and occasionally shooting at each other looking bored
i hAVCE FELIDAE
they were already dead you idiot
I fell asleep around 6:35am, Shizuka
I am off again, visiting a friend. Bai
What are we watching?
Ohai Jim :3
13oh my
its a nice enough movie
fluttercry ok... :/ Then the persorn i asked about how to make an movie entry ether lied or derped :/
Jim: A Fistful of Dollars
red_ony2: I really loved Felidae. ^^ more than I thought I would.
but I slept until 12:40, so it is ok, Shizu <3
Well, I was never into Spyro
ooh, neat
the sex scene was great :D
I also have the book, but it's on my kindle and I'm missing the charger.. so.. oops. XD
leather bags!
red_ony2: I laughed through that scene XD I thought he and Felicity were adorable though ;_;
You made a mistake, Clint.
falcopunch!
The PS1 Spyro games are just awesome.
She got hit.
TLOS is meh.
errr... woopsie
But I guess the 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 6th could be considered A movies. 1st, 7th, 8th, and 9th would be B movies. 3rd is WMC material.
And the PS2 Spyro games are pretty meh
Clint would be the best Brony (inb4 Chuck Norris sells out again)
And Skylanders is a piece of shit.
bury her in desert before someone misses her
too late
Surprise buttsecks
oh. Ok
It's like that stupid cartoony version of Prince Of Persia that came along and shat all over the GOOD PoP games.
PrincessLuna: ... Yes please. ;)

HALF SQUAT!
That's part of this trilogy
PrincessLuna: -_-;
Poor half squat...
Nittany_Discord: that or once upon a time in the west
Oh damn, that Dahaka.
/me hugs Om
Or BTTF Part 3?
Om: Aw, she likes you. :)
NIttany_Discord: They really should have just picked a day to show the whole trilogy
The chase scenes were so intense
Link it.
BTTF 3 is good
yeah.
Nittany speaks the truth
11,01It has what's his name playing The Bad.
GilDash: I know her form another place.
Nittany_Discord, we should have a western movie week
Lee Van Cleef

Lee van Cleef

bad acting
How did that Sumerpan meme get started anyway?
Who would win? Sumerpan, or Clint Eatwood
Ramone's hostage more like
Om: I'm sorry D:
*Eastwood
Goku vs Sumerpan in a fight
GilDash: No, you are a compleate stranger to me.
Clint
Oh my.
Most of the voices are dubbed over, so the acting can be weird
This gon b gud
Kandarihu: I think Nittany_Discord misspelt it... We latched on. :)
tv savvyness tells me the kid will die
05,15It was an Italian film
Ah, okay.
Om: Exotic, isn't it. ;)
I have to see the western with Klaus Kinski and Terence Hill again...
Or how about "How the West Was Won"?
GilDash: I would use the word untrusted.
/me licks GilDash's cheek
Lots of western movies, but I don't watch them sadly
Midnight_Fyre: I always wondered, did Clint spoke italian in the original or did he was dubbed?
11,01I actually laughed at the mistake.
LilB "Il mio nome è Nessuno"?
MaidSurge sorry I don't speak that Language
Rio Bravo is a good western
Nittany_Discord: Oh, well, it was still you who started it. :p
He's thinking "Awkward..."
SirGanjalf: I think he speaks English in them. He does speak Italian though
05,15Clint spoke english
"My name is nobody"?
Om: I would use the term, "exciting." ;)
/me licks PrincessLuna right back. ;)
Right... my name is nobody
dat cigar....
not once in 3 whole movies do we learn his name
Clint with FLOOT vs Sumerpan, who wins?
"Blondie"
Pony with noname
Pony: You like cigars, do you?
GilDash: I bet you have other words in mind -_-

GilDash, indeed I do.
I died. meh

GilDash, I'm into all the sins

Clint translated for Ennio Morricone when he was honored at the Oscars a few years back

I'm sorry. I just can't pay attention to this movie for the life of me. My mind is all over the place right now.
Heart shot... <.<
dat buffering
FROMHIP!
Om: I can be more obvious if you'd like? ;)
GilDash: That's a relief, I have an oath to follow
BOOM, Right in the heart!
Look at that town. No wonder everyone kills each other. It would be boring as hell there otherwise
Aww, he has a heart
Pony: What exactly is that?
45> Rifle
Shot through the heart, and you're too late darlin you give loove a bad name
GilDash: You know what I like.
I'm no expert, but I don't think the heart will care if it was shot with a pistol or a rifle.
eeenope.
Om: You might have to remind me... ;)
Suckface!
I have sworn celibacy, like a good priest should, in the honor of Nittany.
fluttercry: can you believe that there's plenty of semi-desertic landscapes here in Italy? :D
How can it be an "old Mexican proverb" when the revolver and Winchester were relatively new inventions at the time?
Pony: Then you're a very, *very* naughty sinner, aren't you...? ;)
It's paraphrasing a scene in Yojimbo where an antagonist, who has a sixgun, says that a gun will always beat a sword.
11,01Pony: Don't start.
Kammerjunk: I guess that armor will stop a bullet from a pistol, but not a rifle.
rifles and pistols werent
05,15MaidSurge I would believe that yes
the man with the laser shark launcher always wins
Hey everypony!! What is this were watching??
new inventions
:)
05,15Though I believe this was filmed in Spain
GilDash: I'm just guna drop this topic here.
Fistful of money RaveBrony
Nittany_Discord, he asked, I answered.
Midnight_Fyre: Didn't you know? The Mexicans used to consist of Time Lords.
Drunk Blondie
Some sort of Mexican western.
idk
derpy_pony: I agree.
Ah, ty PrincessLuna :P
This was filmed in Spain, fluttercry
Kammerjunk: Oh yeah, I forgot
Kandarihu: But Clint Eastwood shot it just before with his pistol, didn't he?
RaveBrony: No problem :)
Om: I wonder what you'd be liked gagged...
SHOOT ALL THE ROJOS
11,01Spain is a desert?
Not so drunk after all
GilDash, oh yeah, I'm going back to hell when I die.
It has some.
GilDash: Use a ball gag :)
05,15Nittany_Discord some parts
Spain has a lot of desert region in it
GilDash: I would assume I would look gaged >>
Okay. That must've happened while I was randomly wandering around my house. I fail at this movie.
southeast, yeah
Om: PrincessLuna is giving me wonderful ideas. ;)
PrincessLuna: You, are cruel.
The King of Kong: With a Handfull of Quaters was the best Sequell too a Fistfull of Dollars
spain is kinda like mexico I guess
Pony: I'll be right beside you. ;)
Zorro is also a good mexican western, I completely forgot.
GilDash: And don't forget the Cat of 9 tail whip ;)
Nittany_Discord: it's got many parts where there's very little vegetation and dry land
PrincessLuna: Ohh, kinky! :)
I don't even know what the three of you are talking about anymore. It's all oatmeal to me.
11,01K.

Hey, when does this movie end? I wanna take a nap, but I don't want to miss the next movie
Mmmm...Oatmeal..

What the hay!?
Pony: I'll be singing, "~I'm on the highway to hell!~" :D
Break it ALL!

I like the notion of everyone dying with a single shot.
machete>gun
Om: Well, you're not supposed to enjoy it. ;)
Epic knife throw
derpy_pony, what aim? the targets literally stand on the way of his gun.
Clint eastwood with a machete.... gentlemen, we have reached a singularity of badass

Now that's not a knife. :P There's a big difference between them.

So the natural solution to a budget shortfall is "just get rid of those evil greedy teachers and their UNIONS, it's ruining EVERYTHING"
otakon, you're not a potato, but a french person
Nittany_Discord: And we <3 you. :)

I don't want to live in the US for all my life...

Shaken not stern
Yes. He cheats. And very well, I might add.

Vordox But ron paul is like 9001 years old. He'd probably die before he gets into office. Plus, he's a little cooky.

icybeauti: No, that's the way the media has spun him.
I think its my router

Ohai Sumerpan

Fun Fact: Man with no name took that idea from Marty McFly, while he was in the Old West
fluttercry which coincedentally I watched last night for the first time
Paul's the only one of the lot who knows what the hell he's talking about, honestly.
alexxm: Well, the fact that I have finals tomorrow, I have a bad day.:(
CriticKitten: He's been predicting a recession for decades. It's been bound to happen sooner or later
^
Ooh, a political debate. /popcorn
I <3 a pony :D
didn't they try to ban interracial marriage in the 1950s, its the same thing. It's denying a group of citizens their rights, which violates the 14th amendment
how do you not know them?
Yumm politics
We'll see. The elections and stuff are in a few months
alexxm: I took it to class

I like it, Clint is best...man. Not pony.
14th says: No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.
I came in in the middle of it so I'm not even watching it.
Ron Paul's campaign is pretty much over. It's time for his fans to change their strategy to supporting the next-best-thing: Mitt Romney... and also pay attrention Congressional elections too
13!eonget
And besides I need to study for exams.
The only thing I know about Obama is all the gay ppl are backing him up.
13whee
And there's another Luna in chat now, and it gets me confused
This movie was brought to you by the Man With No Name

You laugh at me, I shoot you in the head:[
Too bright to be blood
I'd rather write in a vote for Paul than DARE to vote Romney. A vote for Romney is a vote for Obama. Second verse, same as the first.
/me nuzzles TheRainbowDash
PrincessLuna, And LunaTheBeloved

I gotta say..I'm glad I don't have to vote in the us ..your political spectrum is screwed..oo
LunaTheMostLovedNextToModLuna
GilDash: Just stopping by here for a second, and then going again for studying, I got a mental countdown of the exam date in my head.:D
If they start using LunaThe____ I'm gonna get pissd
CriticKitten: Obama is a full-fledged communist. Romney isn't.
hey WallDives what have you been up to
GilDash: Only from being spanked for course ;)
05,15Obama isn't a communist :/
CCCP: D'awwww....(hugs you back)

icybeauti: Moderate actually.
Sorry LTB but mod luna always comes first
You laugh at me...
13asdfgh
Register ALL the LunaThe...'s
Personally, we should get rid of democrats and republicans
Romney is for taking away people's rights
05,15BUT ANYWAY
I'm with RedOny2 here. If we don't like our system, we change it, HEAVILY. >.>
I wrath at you
:)
TheRainbowDash: Well, I hope all goes well. Try not to fret too much. :)
00,03Sommunism makes me :(
CriticKitten: Okay.
fluttercry: Make it stop :(:(:(
>mfw people don't know the difference between socialism and communism.
alexxm: training, playing, losing, being pissed and frustrated.
I alreadt registered a lot >.<
PrincessLuna: Oh my, I think I'm meeting my match. ;)
I vote Twilight Sparkle for president!
Ohai!! TheRainbowDash :3
00,03Communism on the other hand...
11,01Ron Paul doesn't have enough money behind him.
14lol
I have TheDoctor registered I think
11,01So of course he'll lose.
GilDash: Yeah, I was really fretting on Mobday, but today, very relaxed.
14wait
Kandarihu: Care to point out precisely how Romney differs from Obama?
MFW we're still talking about this.
but I know I have emantrollslayer registered
I'll wait. :P
Socialism gave us many good things
O_O YES! I didn't miss Clint Eastwood ^_^
14I repeated the same message three times
What happened to Herman Cain
<PrincessLuna> Where are youuu :(
/me slaps himself
GilDash: As long as I'm on top :)
i dont have CCCP registered :/
Obama sorta has more chances of winning though
as a european i have to say...you have no idea what communism or socialism are
and I come back to politics. great.
Gunthler|Xbox: Oh hello there!
13y u so unoriginal D:
Public roads, national parks, public education
He was raised on communism from an early age. Romney wasn't.
You might want to
TheRainbowDash: That said, don't get too relaxed. :D You need a little bit of nervous energy.
Nittany_Discord: that is a scary thought, I dont want ron paul to win but if thats the reason he'll lose...
/me hugs TheRainbowDash closely
were i live obama would be far right
ShiningArmor: OH SHINING ARMOR, I'LL BE THERE VERY SOON!
and thus Clint and his pony head into the sunset
Please, SlurryMoon: Put on +m and ask to stop the Political?><
red_ony2: But isn't most of europe in the toliet?
hi TheRainbowDash.
eh im too lazy
yeah
CriticKitten: There are many differences between Obama and Romney.
PrincessLuna: If you think you can take me. :p
NOt that anyone else would use it
do eeet
Let's face it. Obama ran on a campaign that said he'd be different than Bush. LOL DIDN'T HAPPEN.
Moive body count: Clint Eastwood - 638, Arnold Schwarzenegger - 547, Sylvester Stallone - 492, Chuck Norris - 338, so who's the best pony?
nope
i dont know how it works though
ron paul has to many radical plans...makes too much trouble...people don't like when politicians interfere too much, Nittany_Discord
<PrincessLuna> Hahaha!
/me hugs Nittany_Discord, RedScootScootaloo, fluttercry, and SlurryMoon. HUG PILE!
its great here in germany^^
GIVE INTO PEER PRESSURE
Now Romney is saying "I won't be like Obama!"
Cue Yay
GilDash: Too relaexed=I'll sleep during the tests=big 0.:D

/me hugs everyone back
/me 11,01hugs Pinkies4thWall
Pony: All of the above.
And I'm supposed to buy this why?
It the racist free market would ruin my life so, I'm glad Ron Paul is gone.
What? No - It's over? :(
GilDash: It's not about if I think I can handle you, can you survive me ;)
so we dont have that shit going on again
And don't forget about CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCP
/me nuzzles TheRainbowDash
TheRainbowDash: Exactly. :D

emangamer: no one has be a cloned me in a while
great movie
...too long
00,03Whats with all this political talk? Aren't we here to watch Red Dead Redemption the movie?
My lucky guess: This country will have corruption for liek the next few years.
fluttercry: true dat
/me isnt hugged by Nittany_Discord ;___;

thank you all for choosing this, it been far too fucking long since i saw that
Chuck Norris had to license his badassery from Clint Eastwood-- and he's still paying royalties.
TO THE LOBBY
Popcorn time!
How did politics even start here?
/me 11,01bear hugs emangamer
Too bad there's no sequel to that amazing movie!
And Clint goes away, going to kick ass somewhere else wherever he's needed.
but seriously how do i register?
I love this!
:)
Midnight: Such as?
/me GilDash|EqD
there is
/me explosed in Nittany_Discord's arms

/me nuzzles TheRainbowDash
I really hope the pirates vanish in a few years in germany..but enough about that^^
Hopefully, they reform the filibuster so we can get the Obama we hoped for in 2008.
Derpyyyyyy
/me spanks GilDash gently
Curese you United Artistts!
Ask one of the mods
I'm so glad the intermission song hasnt changed <3
Movie body count: Clint Eastwood - 638, Arnold Schwarzenegger - 547, Sylvester Stallone - 492, Chuck Norris - 338, so who's the best pony? you may choose only one.
CritticKitten: Healthcare, for starters
Now i gotta find some pmv with music like in the movie.
its called FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE
he eradicated the whole town, time to go
I love that movie and all of Clint's spaghetti westerns. Good pick Fluttercry!
CCCP: I can teach you
Derpycorn

PrincessLuna: Hey, hey, it's not 6 yet... naughty. ;)

Midnight: Romney-Care?

/me has seen the next film so is catching up on EqD.
ccp
05,15Thank you Fleta
Need more Inigo Montoya.
Movie that is not James Bond in it=not good. (just kidding):D
Midnight: It functions very, very similarly to Obama-Care, just at a state level. People have analyzed them and the similarities are undeniable.
ShiningArmor: Hopefully, if I'm not on watch
RedScootScootaloo: agreed
RedScootScootaloo, Your name is plagiarism! You're also advertising a game here reckless ly! You MUST BE SUED! :P
my personal first and last world about Politics: It's not about wats best for you, it's about what doesn't sucks as much
PrincessLuna: You might want to tell Ommy that. ;)
RedScootScootaloo: Oh come on, you know that if clint and marston ever met, it would herald ragnerok and everything would die in a sea of blood and testosterone
thanks all?
My school's quad line needs more not using drumsticks.
00,03:O
ShiningArmor: But I can't neglect my duties :(
thats*
CriticKitten: The GOP doesn't care about that now, and he will do what they say. They want him to kill Obamacare and he would do it
/me Wonders why this is BronyState if it shows no pony shows
needs more hugs from RedScootScootaloo
follow the instructions
The romney ads don't even attack Obama properly.
/me hugs the hugless~
it should tell you what to do
GilDash|EqD: Ommys a prude sometimes :S
/me hugs RedScootScootaloo back
ShiningArmor, it's a community of bronys
Hey everyone talking about political talk: would you care for a nice pot of shut the fuck up?
/me bounces on otakon's head
wait RedScootScootaloo isnt that an paradox?
ouch!
PrincessLuna: He doesn't seem to like me. Can't possibly imagine why... ;)
To get the story straight about politics, anyone will cause damage, you just pick the president that will do the least amount of damage. No one president has greatly denefitted the country.
I find Romney to be a prick ALL of the time, imo.
05,15ShiningArmor should pay more attention to the name and realize it's BRONYstate not PONYstate
Anyways, gonna be gone for a while. Need to inform my parents that they might need to clear out a room for me after all.
also add email after the password
We should jsut get damn free health care like everyone else. This contry is ful of hipsters that say "Metric is too mainstream" and shit.
:3
MUFFINS! :3
00,03Hey yeah....
it tells you to do that or something allong the lines
00,03OH SHI-
okay
yeah email too
ShiningArmor: DO NOT ASK FOR PONIES!
/me 11,01buffs ShiningArmor
MOAR PONIES
:P
RedScootScootaloo: you just ended the universe you know what that means?
icybeauti: Exactly. There's a *reason* everyone else uses it. :D
Yeah, the last time otakon asked for ponies he ended up being a French person.
When someone tries to block, show them your cock
Wait hang on.
6_9
how nice.
I want my muffins! :(
brb
attack the real issues, not that the person is going on a TV show
ScootaChicken: I DID NOT ASK FOR PONIES!
god i remember the music from Civ 3
11,01You ask for ponies, you'll get ponies. You just won't always like what you get.
holy shit
because it makes more sense to use metric instead of imperial?
this is insane
http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m44sgrDoNi1r3oznx.gif
GilDash|EqD: It's so easy! Customary is way too complex.
:P
00,03I never asked for this....
I hope in after Obama get reelected, we hit the ground running and see if we can get some French-style Socialists into Washington.
apparently, you can link certain nicknames to a registered account
this is fucking insane
http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m44sgrDoNi1r3oznx.gif
imperial is insane..
yeah
actually, no, I need to stay out of this.
icybeauti: Free leathcare will put this country in so much debt, oh wait, this country is already in debt. That will cause unbelievably negative consequences.
:o emangamer
I want G4 pon ies as seen on the Hub
Yea, earlier sucked T_T
I have 2 additional ones

ShiningArmor: Huh?
00,03Because I must Redeem myself B)
TheRainbowDash: Heck, we're pretty screwed already. Why not jump on the wolrd train.
RedScootScootaloo: you got some red on you
Nittany_Discord: Yes
another civ 3 song
05,15Kandarihu.....my mind is full of wut. You make Obama sound like Stalin
<PrincessLuna> Celestia Said Cadence has been replaced o_o
Well, no. Lobbying needs to be reformed, not outright banned.
/me sighs
/me has strawberry Pocky
00,03On my face? Yeah I'm blushing~
11,01Step 2: Vote. Vote out the corrupt politicians.
icybeauti: We might as well say, "I'm joinging Luna on the Moon. Fuck everyone!":D
Public education, national parks, public roads
RedScootScootaloo: twas a Shaun of the dead reference :P
Ohhh...awesome music
11,01Like that shithead Lamar that created SOPA or PIPA.
ShiningArmor: I dont see my sister :o
Nittany_Discord: I just can't trust any politican anymore.
TheRainbowDash: I wanna move to europe. It's less worst there.
The Constitution is so vague. It's no wonder other countries haven't modeled their governments after it.
so yeah, someone get me when political discussion is over.
Nittany_Discord: when do you think we can portal it up?
00,03Sorry twilight_sprinkle, I don't listen to rap~
brb
11,01emangamer: After the movies.
Tovler: it's ment to be vague

00,03Why can't I hold all these walls of texts?
CCCP SPARKLE SPARKLE SPARKLE
/me hugs Midnight
step 4: COMMUNISM
Obsidian: Holla! :)
GilDash|EqD: Do you have cents in...where ever your at?
MaidSurge: Europe is in a better position, or not?
11,01Obama is not a socialist.
fucking daribot...
RedScootScootaloo: ikr?
sparkly CCCP
emangamer: which mean it can say exactly what we want it to say. It's meaningless
Y'know what?
I'm gonna do something
step 4: establish Bronystate Party
twilight_sprinkler: O_O
So I was taking an AP test today, and I drew this awesome Applejack in the margins of the packet, but I'm pretty sure they burn them after the test so it will never survive.
Om: Nope. I was being metaphorical, silly filly. ;)
11,01That's just a buzzword tagged on him by his opponents.
/coolstorybro
step 5: ???
political discussion is worthless, because no one does anything.
GilDash|EqD: I was just wondering >>
You gunna jailtrap someone?
step 6: Profit
Do ho ho
Tovler: not exactly waht we want it to say, but it is open to interpretation to a degree to fit the times
icybeauti: I wasn't following, sorry. You mean about politics?
SO what movie is next
woa
GOP=extremeists, Obama=freamed by doing the wrong thin, but is trying to fiz stuff, but is denied by Republican legislature and a more dominant conservative house. Romney is absolute trash. Obama is well, ok.
Om: Feel free to wonder about me some more. ;)
ScootaChicken!!!!!!!!
WallDives: yeah which is why i dont even bother learning about politics
(framed)
I hate you dari.
Europe is STABLE considering the bubble bursts, siure we may not have the MOST safest ground, but better a ground at all then none at all.

There's no such thing as free. You talk about Free Health Care as if it just comes from nothing.
Hey guys :3
neat
11,01We're headed to a point where the rich and big business will run the country.
twilight_sprinkler: no, learning is fine, its just the "what we should do", even though realistically, no one that makes less than 500k/yr has a real voice. either have a revolution or shut up.

TheRainbowDash: That you're contributing to. :D
Nittany_Discord, while universal healthcare sounds great, can our country even support that?
Hello SuperBrony64!
Foreign policy as in he thinks that the Islamists will leave us alone if we just leave them alone. It's not that serious.
11,01Not really.
11,02Hai :D
WallDives: politics is a game of egoism and lies. i dont believe in the politics syste in general, so i dont bother with it
SuperBrony64: wat kind of figures are you collecting?
/me dying of hunger

Some people want to deny other people the freedom of getting married

Hi SuperBrony64
Kandarihu: His economic policy is to some extent OK, but he is way too extreme. If the GOP wants to remain relevent it needs to find a sane middle ground between the Santorum/Gingrich wing and the Paul wing of the party
11,01And the current form is crap TBH.

RedScootScootaloo: But what if the keys can not be found?
This chat is moving way to fast for me to keep up.
TheRainbowDash: Just leave it alone. It'll do that by itself. :)
11,02loooool rip off of Spike
Not that ugly fucker who just grunts. :/
This music is from Civilization 3
so, GilDash|EqD, still chasing people?
It bugs the crap out of me that the southerners were all Dixiecrats and love big government. Suddenly women and black got a people of the pie and then those same Dixiecrats discovered their inner Ron Paul.
11,02What? O.O
What the heck did I just say. When I said serious, I meant simple.
Much about the current system of everything is crap
