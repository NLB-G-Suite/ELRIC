._.
/me calls in the hit squad

Hellow!
:(
04Thou is also apparently the only mod on at this hour
/me needs to l2stream
04Yo
do you prefer Spike having 1 or 2 penises?
I think he looks cuter with just 1
I don't even
Why would he have two anyway?
I never understood that.
Why?
Meh, doesn't matter.
http://tinyurl.com/79lbf8f
WHY DID I CLICK THAT LINK
I don't even want to click that
WHHHYY

That would be just saaaaad
Okay. Well, who's going to watch season 3, when it comes out..? I know I sure am.

Why Rain?
Depends on my schedule.

I have school when Season 3 comes out.
04Wow
wft?
I just finished my homework, due tomorrow.
^
04Almost reminds me of last summer
^
Mmhhmm
It has been like this a few nights in a row
04Well, fortunately, this is how things typically are when it comes to mods and shifts
because the season ended (thank god)
04WELCOME BACK
Hello!
implying BS getting 5k people on is a regular occourance
back from the dairy
mmmm
Nails
04Haha
Oh mai
04So while 5K is a bit too idealistic at this time, I don't think it'd be too much of a dream to hope for
Well done :D
Man, I loved the songs.
Oh yeah, I looked at that ip map
No dot over my town :(
Hello.
I connected like... 2 minutes before the Finale though
I'll post the vid.
FFUUUU dam mine
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCnj-uiRCn8
sure is hectic in here
Gmorning everypony~
04^
And hello :)
04It's quiet here
04Even though there's 94 people on
It's quite, to quite.
Lurkers, Lurkers everywhere :3
quite :o
I remember fondly, the times when there were 50 people idling and maybe 4 active chatters
Quiet*
Yes..
Lol
04Pfft
^
04I can go back even farther
^
Me to. I can remember the times when there wer 1000000 people chatting..
dun dun dunn
/me thinks silently to self
...wow.
yup
Dat free time./
04But that was in the very beginning
04Like in May of 2011
04Yep
._.
he died of old age
Mai gawd
/me thinks about logging onto Aion.
ewww
eqd
How did I get here again... oh, thats right. I google'd "Brony chatroom" <_>
04We'd always have a way to contact EqD, but we had help with Hipster_Brony at the time
et voila.
Me
04Ah, well
04There you go :P
Hello
*what's
04*ever*
you keep liking it
>Ghosties talks >all the lurkers start talking.
04Mhm
once you stop liking eqd, you know you are slowly starting to dislike the fandom ^_^
04For fun the mods would kick one another all the time
oooooh
04Wut dat
04We were mentioned elsewhere?
:O
04Wuuuuuuuuuut
It's an hour long
:D
04Link please
really where
The site was mentioned, yes.
ye link it
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE7I_IDX98g
NO
that is not cool
04Huh, interesting
I'm a female.
/me winced at that
as am I
04Don't think I'll sit through the whole thing
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4826/
04But I'll definitely keep it in mind
I find it stupid to give different names based on gende
r
it makes the fandom look like two different parts
which it's not
>__>
04I saw both links but typed it in myself
hmm
04Oh yeah, some female fans call themselves 'pegasisters'
ewwwwww
Das silly
04Nothing wrong with that in my mind
Just a name.
I know, but it just makes it look like a different fandom
/me is all about equallity of the sexes
as in, giving a different name just because of gender just doesnt sit right with me :\
As am I.
/me read that as "I'm pretty, bro"
:(
lol
:p
Look rain,Males should have a males name, and Females should have a females name
Just sayin
04You know a girl named "Henry?"
Rain: wow
That's fine.
lol
I know a girl calle jack and a boy called lucy.
hmm. Dat documentary is pretty cool oO
04Ah, that makes more sense
/me 's middle name is "Allen" >_>
WAT
yup
this is MADNESS!
Allen. That is a female and males name. Heard of Ellen Degeneres
Well, I might see yall later.
That lesbian? Yes, I have heard of that pretty lady :3
bye
no Rain she's a FISH!!
fish?
Finding nemo >.>
ok then?
Ellen > Oprah
meh, I go back to my corner
/me curls up next to her bf and tries to fall asleep again
Hiya
^ lol
Hello old mod
04...who are you
04I don't buy that
04Have you been around here before?
maybe he just realizes that any "new" mods to him are probably old mods
lol
even tho if seen it like 4 times
even tho ive seen it 4 times*
Are you really talking to me?
lol 6_9 :p
04Yeah, Ash
Yes, I have been here quite regularly since around the middle of season 2.
04Hmm, interesting
/me shrugs
04Welcome back
04No problem
:(
First episode stream I watched was season 2 ep 1
but first time I was here was week 23 of BMN

Babes in Toyland
Oh lord

Why did that get WMC?
Because it ended about 2 hours after everyone wanted it to
Lol
also, it /created/ the WMC
Think mine was Season 2 EP 15
How long is it? :o
04Too long
too damn long
04Babes in Toyland is horrible
^
04Probably the worst film I've seen here
^
04And yes, like Rain said, it created the WMC
LOL Wish I was there to see it
04No you don't >>
no, never wish that
04It was terribad
oh.
