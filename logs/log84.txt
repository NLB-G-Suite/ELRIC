*Enters chat**Sees this*What the hell?
I hope not
9it's somewhat related to ponies
OH, THOSE images.
9SOMEWHAT
I remember now.
Anyways Hi everypony.
9here http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/8cf081064fbf91cfde15d50b9ca0c620/19727%20-%20gundam%20rainbow_dash%20super_robot_wars.png
Everyone doing good?
9sup Jon
Sup jon
Hello Jon.
ohai Jon
...Isn't there EVA Pony art?
Dash has too much emotion to play setsuna.
hoy hoy jon
9yeah, but only one pic that I can recall
God why am I capping random letters...Sorry I'll stop.
9obviously Setsuna is Scootaloo
9Just look at them.
I recall a dude on DA doing some..
9they're fucking identical aside from hair and eye color
the hair works
/me 7is still stumped as for a name for her image.
Give me a second.
9Oh God
9....this is glorious http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/0c570ed967488396d9801da2e10217ec/18453%20-%20Sweetie_Belle%20apple_bloom%20comic%20mecha%20robot%20scootabeam%20scootaloo%20super_robot_wars.png
Does this count?
also not sure if this will work
9that's pretty cool
9also
9I just realized
9Alto = Perfect Caramel
If any thing I see dash being um, what the hell was the one from gunbuster.
6uhgudxdkjgvndf
>mfw I have TWELVE tabs open.
9Noriko
that's the one
6I forgot the continues are different in SA
/me 7is thinking about just calling it 'Birds'. O_o
6just fok and see what comes up
I have far more than that.
7o.o?
6fok = face on keyboard
6like so
I normally have 4-5 tabs open.
buster kick so fits with a rainboom.
7Ah.
13LOL
7Interesting abbreviation.
7D:
9quite frankly
9if I were to put Dash in a mech
9it'd have to be something much faster than that
9probably Cybuster
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CW6zX7kzO0w/TkRqho2mDMI/AAAAAAAAKQg/awuWXvLZzSw/s1600/rainbow_dash_nanosuit_by_hereticofdune-d4650x9.jpg
WHAT BUTTON DID I PRESS LOL
7Weeeeeell, you disconnected.
what mechs that can move in FTL are not fast enough =p
For once i use this name while I'm still actually connected, but I'll be back in not so long :p
9Twilight Sparkle is perfect for Nu Gundam though
/me 7pseudorandomly types and see what she can interpret out of her doodle.
>mfw I have no clue whats going on cause I don't watch anything mecha
9hence why I said Cybuster
9Cybuster, the Elemental Lord of the Wind
Jon, all you have to do is watch.
9is probably the fastest mech in fictional history
And enjoy the sight.

{1,0You0,4Tube}: "Sweetie Belle - Oh my, sounds serious" -

9Dash'd be a good Valkyrie pilot
the one marked self destruct?
/me runs

So, any idea what pony Simon would be?
Skip of 3 seconds long
skip of 7 seconds
skip of 1 seconds
9huh

he's saying the streem is lagging again
yeah it just began skipping like crazy
7Birds is still my best option. X.x
9downloading OOO's is taking a lot of my bandwidth
9give me a moment to cancel that download
9and get one via mediafire
ah, much more fluid now
you gonna try it too, angel?
who needs to aim when you have raie of fire.
9welp

OOO?
9give me a moment
what's OOO?
9gonna bump up the quality
"It was part of a yacht club."
9and start the LQ Stream as well
What's OOO DCD?
Big O?
9Kamen Rider OOO
OH
9what we used to watch in Post-Show
suddenly geting a mental image from the sleep over ep.
...umm...Is there any way to make it so i can keep an eye on both stream and chat without messing with zoom?
Cause zoom makes the text tiny.
dont fullscreen the streem
is this really whats going on 3 hours before anything starts? >_>
yes, TTS
this is what happens before anything start.
Isn't this DCD's last stream?
This is what happens when we're not Friday or Saturday watching movies
9LQ Broadcast is live!
9Thetrollside: till the preshow officially starts
DCD
9which will be later
9basically
for your last broadcast
9it's not even preshow time yet
do what i suggested
So if I fall asleep to BMN, will I wake up to dramatic readings of clopfics?
if oyu dont remember
cupcakes :S
...This looks like fire emblem with mechas.
9but I am Le Tired
I'm okay with this.
9man I like FE a lot
9I WISH animations in FE were THIS crazy
sleep is for the weak
Best game?
Oh god if FE had these animations
9suddenly Laguz doing crazy million-hit combos on enemies
But when I sleep, I dream of ponies...
*Squee*
9and Sain multi-stabbing with his lance
Do Cyberponies dream of electronic sheeps?
Lyn I think her name was?
9and then Aether looks like a fucking DBZ attack
doesn't she just crit everything?
SO, is the lottery today or tomorrow?
9man I love this dynamic kill
9I think it's today
Lottery is today
9SOKOOOOO
Oh god lyn is broken as fuck...*remembers 100% crit rate*
I sense badass.
no kill like overkill
oh my bad japanese
Jon, there are things even more awesome than what's already on stream ATM.
if only i understood japanese :S
Wait 'til you see Gurren Lagann or Dai-Guard in action.
Those two are insane.
9I don't but I STILL ENJOY THE SHIT OUT OF THIS GAME
Is this one of the original units?
9e'yup
soooo
Purple, that's the player character.
you dont know the story
just like the explosions
mecha man
9well there are translation guides for the story in development
If you think Dai-Guard is awesome, just wait until you see ponies, it'll blow your fuckin' mind
9but yeah, I'm clueless
9but then again
Why not aim for the head? where the pilot is?
9Pinkie
Jon, pilot is way too small?
9why do you settle for less?
...Not if you just blow off the head.
besides the pilots are always in the chest.
9why not
...Ok i'll buy it sumica.
9PONIES IN DAI-GUARD?!
oh god
on the GROUND?!
What? Should I go for Dai-Guard with ponies instead?
NewDCD that would be flipping awesome.
WANT NOW DCD
I wonder. What pony would Justice be?%
Well, they already kinda did the magical girls thing in season 1
lets see them do Magic Knight Rayearth for season 2
9http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/18116?search=super_robot_wars
(Dai-Guard pilot is justice-like)
9PONIS IN DAI-GUARD
OH RIGHT
Scoot is everypilot
Hers is the drill that will pierce the heavens?
7Hrm...
wrong drill =p
/me 7decides to ninja-upload that drawing.
^^
9yeah
...*shrug*You can always use a drill.
Hers is the scoots that will scoot all over heaven
9Dai-Guard's is the Drill of Awesome Suckage
Is Scoot simon too?
Holy bananas! Super Robot Taise.
that just sounds wrong
Awesome...suckage?
ohai Solarboy
*blinkblink*
9if you watch the series
Wich SRT is this? Hi Dermathil, do I know you? o_o
9it's pretty much the most realistic Super Robot show till now
9SRWZ2
9because when they activate the drill
9they lost control of it at first
9due to FUCKING TORQUE
DCD you need to watch what ya type people like me will twist what you type
yeah
They took TORQUE in account
lol
Haha, the counter almost killed him
9we watched Dai-Guard here in BronyState
9the whole series
yeah
9during this week
9in two days
toque but not mass eh?
at my request I think?
9GO, SCOOTALOO F. SEIEI
9ohai Molestia
Sumica, the only thing they don't take into account in Dai-Guard is the Square/Cube rule.
MOLESTIA
Where if you put the size to the square the mass is put to the cube and so on
The CMC would Pilot Shin Getter Robo
LUNA IS BETTER D:<
Yes, that is me.
...
9Molestia
9I have a special surprise for you next turn
CUTIE MARK CRUSADER SUPER ROBOT PILOTS, YAY!
@pony The pony most likely to molest Molestia

Such a coincidence, I was playing SRTW earlier today
orly?
^ Sapphire Shores

7Okay, now that's done...
Sorry purple it needs to start with a C =p
7Off to do my other homework.
NewDCD, are you DLing something again?

6 The Next pony to be molested by Molestia is 7G5ild15a
9okay

I'm okay with Gilda being molested.
How does death work in this game?
OH YES

Oh colt here we go.
/me marks Gilda on her list.

And so a new crater was created on the moon.
MOON-TOUCHING PUNCH!
I think its dead.*looks at moon*
See? I'm so awesome even the streamer's game takes ideas from me.
9LUNA! EINA!
GRAVION!!!
viva la resistance?
If there is a 1Â° reason to play SRT it's the overly dramatic battles.
Oh god manly tears moment in Torchwood. Fuck this show for making me cry. :(
It's liek playing a Michael bay movie.
Except it's good and has 20% mreo explosions.
so DCD how do you play if you dont understand the controls? just hope w/e you press kills something?
mech-ael baysplosions
aw, lookit the chibi gundam
The commands are easy to learn troll.
Most stuff is trial and error at the begining, but you get the hang of it really fast.
9or
9you could play one of the English SRW first
9and get the hang of it
That helps too.
SRW-J is good to try to get the hang
wheres the fun in that? 8D
the more en it cost the more it hurts =p
hi fellow bronies
hi mib
...Did the mech just go underwater?
*blink*
yes he did
from below
One of the keys to a successful game franchise is to never drastically change the controls that work well.
also online guides help with Japanese games
the japanses, how do you they work? Dx
ugh
japanese*
Wait, why don't Gndams have their obnoxius theme like in the rest of the SRT games? D:
9is anybody checking the LQ stream?
They work diligently and with lots of gusto
nope
...L...Q?
*blink blink*
the what now?
This is actually the first time the HQ stream is working for me, so I don't feel like looking.
Low Quality
For people with lower bandwidths.
*cough*lunaisbest*cough*

Is it just me, or is the LQ stream acutally ahead of the HQ Stream?
11split? what split?
the split in the game.
12so i left the bucket in my room until he gets back
He's only got a limited series of shows to play with ATM
no Dai-Guard or TTGL
SCRAMBLE! SCRAMBLE!
12and i look over and there's the cat with the bucket tipped over and all the water seeping into the carpet

Moonshot incoming?

What would Fluttershy pilot?
9the Dragon Gundam
probably one of the support bots
11Fluttershy would pilot a giant robot of Angel. :3
9due to Sai's finisher being A FUCKING BUTTERFLY
Pinkie Pie piloted Wing Gundam ZERO for too long, and look what happened...
More letters por favor
She wouldt fight, she would be support.
06what
Fluttershy would probably be on a Capital Ship
Great, my internet and Nickname both derped :3
brb
lol Silverscreen
What's the Cap-Ship that Lacus Clyne pilots?
so what happened to the giant interdimensional lizard bots?
High quality? oooh when did that happen?
NewDCD, are you DLing something? It is lagging slightly in my 60Mbps Download.
9it's called "U.S.S. Useless Mary Sue Bitch"
lol
I was thinking one of the 00 support ships, the one that did't blow up =p
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/43735?search=cutie_mark_crusaders The CMC would so ride in Shin Getter
9better?
yeah
9it was youtube
heheheh
/me counters with the aura and puts Umbreon in Espeon floof instead
/me wants to see a dynamic kill :P
12xx
4Just wanted to tell DCD that I'm having slight hiccups every now and then for the High Quality stream. And I wanted to ask him if he changed anything from last night when we were testing.
CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS GIANT MECHA PILOTS! YAY!
9didn't change anything. It's probably because I had YT open
oh hey
that was a veritech
me gusta
What would Rarity be in?
something flashy ;)
and lol! I just took this from my batman animated series DVD http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b88/nick-metroid/d7566b72.jpg
Something flashy and classy
4Do you run anything else while Streaming, DCD?
Joker troll face?
9Rarity in the Nobel Gundam
now that I picture it I can see rainbow dash with a gundam. it could even have the hairdo.
Nah
9the other stream
Angelg
9but now everything else is closed
9good choice, Purple
Joker > Troll Face
4And you just started the LQ stream today right?
Rainbow woudl have to be in something from G Gundam, though.
o_O
correction
9yeah
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Sleeping with a blue bird.
4I wonder if that's why...
INTERESTING.
9yesterday we were testing with LQ as well though
Definitely not Gundam Wing. Those mechas run on emo.
9I think I'll tweak the quaity an eenzy weenzy bit
4Yeah, and I was slightly freezing a couple times
and we all know what blue bird that is
4And now the stream is gone
lol freeze
My stream had no lag actually
9and it's back again
just reload
9lowered from 600 to 550
4I'm guessing my stream drops now
9quality difference should not be very noticeable
@pony Solarboy27's waifu
looks fine
6 Solarboy27's waifu is 8Bo12nB13on
yeah it pretty much looks the same
though I just had a hiccup
4Either I'm not getting enough mbps to properly allow for fluid streaming, or it's on your end
/me has looked forward to his first movie night :) make it work damit
9how is it now?
I can't see the chat, I'm forever alone here ):
It's fine here
this your first one stripes? welcome in that case :)

@pony The pony most appropriate to play Domon Kashu, King of Hearts,
6 The pony most appropriate to play Domon Kashu, King of Hearts, is 8Bo12nB13on
4Well, it's not like the stream freezes every two seconds. It's sporadic, so I can't really gauge the quality of a frozen stream
I can let you know every time it freezes
but like ghosties said, it isn't consistent
9please do so
@pony The bonbonest bonbon in the entire world
6 The bonbonest bonbon in the entire world is 5A8ce
Doesn't freeze for me. It did before when you had Youtube open
9I want zero freezes
4I'm guessing it freezes for Val too?
eeyup
4How's your mbps, Val?
11if you're referring to the HQ stream, mine is running smoothly
eh...not sure...last time I checked it was like...I don't even remember...19? 16? I dunno
been fine here from the point you stoped OOO
I forgot the link to check >.<
Myeah HQ stream is fine.
9speedtest.net
if yer wondering, mine's 63.06. and I get slight lag.
one every two minutes or so
there
*once
just had one
4Silver, weren't you having problems last night wit hthe stream?
11Yes I was.
and there
4It's hiccuping
4The stream, that is
11And suddenly a hiccup
oh, actually got a short hiccup there
11that was weird.
4Freeze
again
there
and again
13asdfgh
9there
9lowered bandwidth consumption a bit
13adorable Touhou and Puella Magi-related images http://danbooru.donmai.us/post?tags=haru_%28kyou%29&commit=Search
Ra
13<3
9from now on, it should run pretty smooth
4As long as it allows for fluid streaming with no freezes or hiccups
OK
That's adorable
9how is it right now?
apparently my download speed is 11 right now, though I am running 3ds max here...which drains memory like a bitch
No freeze again thus far.
well it's fine now, but again it happens randomly, not consistently
4slight hiccup
the best I can do is let you know whenever it happens
http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b88/nick-metroid/trollfaces.jpg
4It appears to happen during battle sequences
the similarities...o0
I wub dis guy
More motion then, so yeah
/me mmmmm's
hit em again hit em again, harder harder.
4DCD, can you understand all that kanji?
/me is getting no probs on streams..smooth here
9is everyone getting hickups?
9and no, I'm just a SRW veteran
no
no
no
still good here.
4Ah. Well, currently, it's fine
9huh
ghosties comp just sucks
9it's probably
9his hardware, yeah
06but joker IS basically a trollface with a body
no hiccups my end
True dat
9gonna increase bandwidth a bit on the LQ side
well, it was happening to me too if that contributes
no hiccups since I last mentioned
4@Thetrollside, it wouldn't be my comp. it would have to be my net connection
9increased
4My laptop is less than a year old
DONT GET TECHNICAL WITH ME

4It's less than a year old, Sumica
the moment you open the box it's outdated

God I love this game
/me 4has never been big on Mechs or Mecha anime
/me is confused by flashy anime
Good ol' Rocket Punch
hahaha
he just webbed your shit dcd
4Actually
4Now that I recall
Dai-Guard has a rocket punch. Well, a thrown punch.
4There was Mech Warrior and Mech Commander
4Those games were fun ^_^
06hump day 365 days a year it seems
4Especially Mech Commander
ahhhh mech warrior
I loved that game
flashy anime...mmmmm.../me puts on some kimba for Thetrollside
9Also
9you might have noticed
Lol
9but the Static we used to have before in the stream is all but gone now
lover the elemental and the mad cat from those.
9derp
9I mean
9Gone
4There's a slight fuzzy sound when there's nothing going on screen
That jet has legs.
what.
dude, moar veritechs and gundams
4But it's not entirely noticeable
That's a bit of a stretch for a simple typo lol
>wants more veritechs and gundams!
>moar TTGL and Dai-Guard
4Yeah, there it was
4that sound
4Like a low rumble
lol true Espeon
>MOAR MOON
4very low rumble
9oh Ghosties
9that's not the static we used to get before
but I just happened to notice that face as I paused the DVD to go get a drink o0
9that's just my PSP
I was like OMFG ITS TROLLFACE
4Oh
9when you connect both an USB cable and a cable into the audio jack
9they resonate and make that rumbling sound
/me has potentially discovered a new meme!?
4Do you know what was causing the static before?
ahhh...
I never noticed any static. Must have not been paying attention
06I think I've seen a few Joker trollfaces before not sure if it was that particular one though.
oh, question about tonight's stream
My speakers are shit, so no low rumbling, yay!
oh really? *googles*
how long is the movie first showing?
9yeah, it was my Stereo Mix setting
9I believe 90 minutes
9I haven't checked the running times
90? gotcha
/me doesn't want to miss the auction on account of driving home >.<
4Not sure about This Island Earth
We gonna watch This Island Earth or Scott Pilgrim first? I forgot
4This Island Earth, Dermathil
darnit.
TIE.
4We save the better movie for last :D
jease that guy cant hit a dam thing.
if its a b movie its shit :S
yeahGhosties.
or a comedy
*Yeah, Ghosties.
4If what's a b movie, trollside?
4Like, any movie that's chosen as b movie?
any movie thats picked in here
4...
4No
4Evil Dead II, Army of Darkness, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes
4All those beg to differ
i said shit or comedy
Dammit ghosties, you need to rig the draw for me!
and spiders web
9>rig the draw
4Evil Dead II wasn't exactly a comedy
Evil Dead 2 isn't comedy...
9>Implying we could rig the draw
4It was more of a horror film
DON'T SAY THAT NAME, ZECORA.
it acted like it
4It had some elements of comedy, but it wasn't outright comedy like Army of Darkness
that's more that the main character was that era's equivalent of Jim Carrey
You're a smart guy NewDCD. I'm sure you'll figure something out.
The movies that get picked as a B movie here are either old, bad, a comedy or cheap
4Evil Dead II is the best example of a horror comedy
Scootaloo attack!
4Well, Apok, that's the point of a b movie
phfff, give me the B choice this week and I will prove you the fuck wrong :P
Attack of the killer scootaloo's
4I mean, I personally believe Army of Darkness was badass
4And good
I'd go on a rant about B movies again, but I'm sure you know how it goes by now
WTF is his name "Lock On"?
That's because Army of Darkness is both those things.
lol
lockon stratous

11FREEZEFRAME!
O_o
Anyway, about the B movie thing. I think you should call it something else. Like humorous movie (because we usually make more fun of B movies) and serious movie because it's usually more serious like Inception and has better production values so we can't really make fun of the movie being bad
24....THOUSAND damage
that's a ton of damage
Oh wait, it's a plot fight. nevermind,.
4I want a firebird gundam
4freeze
4FREEZE JUST GOT REAL
11A and B movie have been working fine so far.
4That wouldn't work Apok
It's confusing
well if your going to get the job done
OHSHI-
for anyone that knows what a B movie is
ValtheJean, TTGL has an attack that does 150K dmg in a cutscene.
REINFORCEMENTS
9>enemy reinforcemnts
4So much rendering going on in the stream
niiiiice
9.............
9okay
9episode preview
That picture...
4Case in point, Apok, the A movie this week is Scott Pilgrim which is by no means a "serious" film
9we'll continue this shit post-MN
9since, y'know, it's preshow time
Touhou is the bottom of the screen scrolling shooter game isn't it?
yeah, but I'm sure we will make more fun of the B movie than Scott Pilgrim
ooo
if I remember
4Still, it's not a serious movie. It doesn't work
Yeah and the B movie isn't alwayws a B movie
Yep
HAYAKU MODOTTE KOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOI
cos I thought 1945 was insane for projectiles, but the vids I saw of touhou!
9okay
9gonna start the preshow
4Like when, Apok
9TRANSLATOR'S NOTE: That means "PLEASE HURRY AND COME BAAAAAAAAAAAAAACK!"
By staying at the bottom is a one sure way to die
4Can you give me an example?
Baaa baba baaaa baba baaaa baba barararararara
a hair could get hit lol
Like I said before a B movie is a cheap movie. Nothing more, nothing else. It can be good or bad
...I'm back DCD.
Big O! Show Time!!
Does that count?
That is the definition of a B movie
11Anypony want to see what I've been working on recently?
by that definition Battlefield Earth was the exact opposite of one
wait, Dai-Guard Babababababababa?
4B movie isn't always a "cheap" movie. The actual definition for what we have is "B/cult" film
Shhuure?
11meaning the thing I did just five minutes ago?
clopfic?
4So anything that's art house, cult status, or cheap
Yes sir
Yes, what you have. And funny, this is the first time I've heard the movies being reffered to as cult films
11http://i51.tinypic.com/10d9oup.jpg
And yet people are pro at that game
10My internet is hardcore derped tonight.
Just saying, that your definitions and the actual ones aren't the same
4We've done it the entire BMN history
10 0.32 Mbps d/l...
Beating yukari in no deaths
Good lord
cool
lol rainbrodash
Oh, Heromachine, Silverscreen?
11si
I recognise the style.
4Whenever you see us saying "pick the b film" we're implying B or cult
I've always heard it refered to as B movie in the chat, the newsletters and the threads
13everyone goes through the "omg that looks impossible" when they first find Touhou
11I call it the Ponyzord. XD
13but once you're past that stage
4Because that's what we recognize as our definition
13it's easy to get hooked |D
Used to use that thing about 4 years ago
I've actually seen ppl complete the NES dragon's lair game with no deaths
Because the videos often show the most insane battles
THAT'S insane!
Well if you have your own definition for a B movie that is diferent from the regular definition then call it something else is all I'm saying
4B/cult is anything art house, cheap, bad, or cult status
06isn't dragon's lair that terrible like
06interactive movie of sorts
4And Battlefield Earth was a *bad* film
4Real bad
06that was re-released for the pstriple at one point? (like with many consoles before it)
Yes, it was, but it wasn't cheap
06If not, sorry
06xD
There is no way BE was an 'a' film for sure
4But it was bad
phhffff >implying leverage isn't badass :P
RainBroDash: , im only on 256k atm!
there's a reason Battlefield Earth is part of the bottom 250 movies on IMDb
4That's honestly what we classify a b/cult film as
10stripes... how
4those four requirement
4s
11It's only confusing to people who actually know the technical term. If that's the only reason for needing to change it, then I don't agree with the need to change it.
Yes, but like I said before you're judging the movies by your own standards not the standards that are normal for a B movie
This Island Earth is B in the sense that it's old and somewhat campy. It's a very good film though
Do you know what my choice is for B-movie?
9and we're live.
9do you get signal?
yup
RainBroDash: , isb stick on eeepc at work!
yes

Rainbow-: Meh, I'll just play it on my Wii.

Especially New Vegas itself. I've been to Vegas, it should've been much bigger and stuff.

HOW DID NOBODY SEE THAT?
DOUBLE JUMP
Double jumping during a long jump event.

Lyra?

chickes dig her
AJ won that
damn ungrateful chickens
ckicks is pissed
FLUTTERPEANUT
Trixie is best pony
technically, they never said wings were off limits.
DOUBLE JUMP.PROBLEM?
The only place Oblivion beats out Morrowind is graphics and an improved gameplay system, both of which can be attributed to its being five years newer.
how are you?
Lyra wins all events
8o hai peanut
how was that a contest?
0And for humour, cause I'm salt free, donut free, and cupcake free

Seriously, AJ won

Are there more RBD>AJ bronies here than AJ>RBD?

PINKIE PIE IS HIGH

Kent Brockpony: "We now go over to Pinkie Pie in the Sky! Whats the weather Pinkie?"
4Morrowind has plenty of good mods
ghosties both act like jerks in this one. Dash's competitiveness started it, but AJ still cheats too
I am high!
LordEchimaru: She's high on life.
PINKIE STOLE TWILIGHT'S BALLOON

Whoever gave Pinkie that job was high at the time
Really, in this episode, TS > both of them
Pegacorn: Mostly life.
Morrowind has a lot of great content and expansions but it is way too clunky
every time Dash laughs at someone I laugh too
0dash being a second tier species pony as well as being just awesome she is clearly superier
HEAD EGG
Morrowind has a much better world, an actually good main quest, way more content, better balance/level/loot system . . . etc.
I can't tell who is higher, Pinkie or the balloon.

Twilight is gonna be first
IMO morrowind is slightly better than oblivion

Pony QWOP needs to happen. Maybe QWOP:ASKL Four limbs = extra hard
The difference between AJ and RD is that AJ actually listens to Twilight.
BARACK OBAMA IS BEST PONY
0ghosties , then again, with her competative "top of the world" attitude and personality, she would probably get much farther in life and be more successfull, but then again again, happiness is the true measure of a good life
applejack's destiny is a rock

Dash trips over a tree stump, and is completely convinced that AJ cheated despite her pulling ahead by a good distance by then.
you can hate all you want ^_^
rainbow's destiny is a stump
Dude, she was AHEAD of you!
SHES STUMPED LOL AND SHE HAD TO LEAF
We can all be turds

How did she trip? I guess im STUMPED!
Dman: Too bad I have very little coding experience.
RD's only real competition for best pony is fluttershy, because Pegasus ponies are the best ponies
Goddammit Obama!
how could u not see that stump
Rezo-chan2: Remember episode 16?
Tyranico - feelsbadpony
It was my birthday last week, and I got Portal 2
Applejack was like, five feet away from her, and Dash still thinks AJ tripped her. :<
espylacopa well then technically, the bullies are the saviors of Equestria. Which would mean Fluttershy is the real savior for being picked on. FLUTTERSHY IS THE SAVIOR OF THE WORLD
OH MY GOD A GIANT STUMP

CELESTIA BURN THEM WITH THE SUN

I will never understand how two ponies not running means that half the leaves didn't fall...
Are we watching the A movie first?
TAKE IT FROM THE BITCH PRINCESS
She forces them to run again by themselfs, TROLLESTIA!!!!
you lost the race, run it again!

Answer the last question first? WHY?
Ballooooooons

So they just joined in with no resistance?
OMG! My hands are made out of metal!

my ears
>preeson
Magnets? How do they work...?
Magnets. HOW DO THEY WORK ON ORGANIC MATTER?

I was just figuring, this started after a 22 minute pony episode, which started at 7, so it's been about an hour going.
LET ME SPIN THE COLOR WHEEL

HAND MAGNETS HOW DO THEY WORK
I like how future gadgets look like toddler toys

For the love of god, don't fart.

"Hey captain, why don't we have any seats"
and uranium blows up
crono_flash their foreheads?

listen to the forehead
WELCOME...TO PANDORA

Ionized layer is good protection against meteroites.
Why not mine Uranus?

Why don't they just switch to using shields that turn on where the meteors are going to hit instead of a shield covering the hole planet?
But do not be fooled by what Pandora appears to be!

And there was our brothel.
AND THERE....is the remains of our porno theatre
That green screen...
And now smile, because we are making photos you have to buy for high prices at the end of the ride.
So long as there's no Endermen.
Why would we want the movie to make fun of itself? We do a good enough job on our own.

Ruth has ceased all pretense of competence now
And there was Sugarcube corner

Rescue from Midnight Castle has horrible pacing (It really should've been two episodes), but art & animation are quite decent for an 80s cartoon, and as stated, it's amazing to see how the main villain and his number two basically merged to become Luna/ Nightmare Moon in the G4 incarnation.
HIS LEG IS STL MOVING.

It killed him.
Kick is ass!
