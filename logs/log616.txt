00,02JRP, just doesnt appeal to me that much
00,02but only once in a while
but you host a server with low ping
and not 213213231 ping
00,02that runs on my home connection

Still here!
00,02yay~
00,02killerpony7733, trying to not play it for a bit :P
massive performance problems?
00,02yeah
00,02when episodes air, we get a few thousand viewers
00,02who all refresh at once
00,02its a little harsh on the server
I can see that being a problem :/
00,02when this finishes doing whatever its doing, i'll show you some numbers
FOR LUNA
/me salutes
00,02this is hack together make it work
00,02if you were to actually run the commands i just run you'd be shot
00,02now, lets use apachebench to simulate, say, 100 users
00,02hitting the site 1000 times
I promise not to use this as a guide>_>
00,02immposibly fast
00,02AdamTheDuck, ^_^
00,02this may take a while
You know, the text is hard to read here.
00,02i know
00,02there we go
00,10phase, are you breaking the server again?
00,02"Requests per second: 26.37 [#/sec] (mean)"
00,02XD
00,02during episodes we get thousands of hits a second
00,02well, during the stream switch
00,02hence the performance problem
00,02i'ma try the same thing with a static file
00,025K Req/s
00,02limited by the benchmarking app
00,02it pegged a cpu, rest of them were near idle
00,02and i forgot where i was going with this

Aww yeaah

00,02crap
00,02wrong button
Uhh... where is he supposed to be? Is this a mod?
:D
00,02i needed to press a different button
00,10woops

WHY DIDNT U DO THAT THE FRIST TIME
uh houston. we need a tow, pronto

00,10gyros are magic

TO GLORY!
time to explore minmus

00,10now they can die together
00,02well
Imagine all the vomit in that capsule-
You move like the tentacles from day of the tentacle do.
Hi guys, we're watching some KSP?
00,02now i might try nudging that ship
00,02with my ship
That's all you can do now isn't it

Wait, wait, WAIT. Is that the moon?! HAWLY SHEET!

00,02Dark_Horst, magic
00,10why not bump him with kerble
thx
epseically if they added lasers
opperation nudge is a go
00,10no RCS again I see
aeoiuaeoiuaeoiu
you're doing the most scientifically precise thing you can
00,10shame cause you could lateral with that
00,10not the mun.
00,02good thing i'm on minmus
00,10this is the other satelight minmus
That is some really, really fine control.
probably soon....
roflol at the music to whats going on
00,10some realy good fine controll seeing as he is useing just gimbls and gyros
now entering orbit
Are you leaving him?
i whould like to see that
its good with people
It's good fun for a few times. It's really realistic.
00,10Nyst, there are some videos of people using landing struts as claws
It's also very slow and repetitive, but that's to be expected from something realistic.
00,10guy grabs another pod using the struts and take both the grab pod and the grashed pod backe to kerth
brace for it
o.O
or a name
old dr.who
00,10not off hand no
00,10Wrek, arts =p
05FNV is tempting
Oh fair enough o.o

NO,NO,NOOOOOO
00,02crap
nooooooooooooo
ABANDON SHIP
lol
00,02man, some rcs would be nice
00,10Phase4, why dont you bump him with the other kerble instead?
Just over half a tank of fuel left.
The fuel has me really worried
00,02wait
00,02i have idea
Ideeeeaaaaaa!
00,02Sumica, dont want them both getting stuck
tractor beam?
do idea
00,02Sumica, i have the debris set to 0
00,10should be ok if he has his pack on.
*have
00,10it might remove the ship if the pod is gone from it.
00,10good thinking
very slow but intence
YESHHHH
It sounded like something out of LoTR...
lol yup
00,02DAMNIT
00,10time for third resque ship equiped with rcs
soon you'll have a whole colony
of ships needing rescue
can he wiggle his way out
How was he going home with just half a tank fuel, anyway?
you need to send jebediah kerbel
Can EVA'd kerbals run out of jetpack fuel?
00,10yeah
00,10I think it's refilled when they dock
ram the ship with his body!
Yes.

00,10who>
Time to go home
MY LITTLE BATTLETECH?!
00,02:3
they have to return to kerth
Is there room for three in that capsule?
00,10I think this might be a first
inb4 they die coming home
hopefully there is enough fuel
00,02hmmm
00,10one mission coming back with crew from another
Looks like there's room.
00,02seems kerbin is tidally locked too
we have retrived the stuck one and are now coming home
00,02ONWARD
FOR GREAT JUSTICE
FOR EQUESTRIA!
AND TSFH!

00,02ah
for great justice
00,10this is a 3man pod
00,02Nyst, no, rotation is implimented
00,10seems he kickd one out on the pad though
00,02Nyst, its just that both moons are tidally locked
Do it!
DO IT
00,02didnt even touch the outer tanks
math
and magic
00,10it caculates alot of that
alright evry pony its been pleasent but i must bid farwell
00,10some of it you just play by ear
but then that wouldn't be very fun
00,10like if you are going to the mun
or lunas theme
00,10you orbet kerblin and just as the mun is riseing you burn at it.
or hers sisters
This looks like a good place to land
00,10when the line changes to yellow he has an intercept corce set
Is it going to overshoot?
00,10red is a colision
do they have a exosphere on kerbin?
00,10woops
Oh that is NICE!
Oh mai
no resistance from the atmosphere?
00,02might be a bit fast
00,10there is resistance but no friction
Man where are the rockets going to land
00,02nvm, seem to be slowing
i bet 5 bits for a splashdown
00,10the rockets that is
splashdown is best down in this case
00,10including kerbals
00,02thats jeb
football mode
00,02he's always like that

Actually, even the parachute has explosives in it.
You spin me right round
Jeb has no fear
Do you think my name is a noob name?

<3
I don't think they look at most of the images
or music
only fanfiction
which is interesting. since most of the fanfiction is pretty bad anyway
lol
Hehhe
or it is
someone leaked it
and they're apparently cracking it in various ways
cool
00,10dat machinima
all you gotta do is to crack the laucnehr and voila
Guild Wars 2 soon! Who's playing?
it was crazy high
i would play guild wars 2 but its not free to play ;_;
ie. the last round up start
I live in Northern Ireland

Since I tend to act like a maid sometimes.

AHHHHHHHHHH
twilight is best sniper
cool weapon :p

those aren't games imo :P
00,10ah

/me facehoofs at DoctoDoctorWho's qustion
x.x
Trixie wasn't mean enough
brb
I'm curious. Why is she a maid?
well i play now Divinity 2 as Warrior xd
wish me luck I'm going to try to get my xlive working..
back
It's good, but I felt it was a bit- average in quality at times
It didn't get me, really, as a shipfic
Yup yup
Night all
twilights and the lognsword sniper works well together :3
00,10yeah I prefer that over the bazzar bargen that she always seems to be using in the videos
(sorry for wall o' text)
it*
Oh, I was only half way through it, didn't know she got worse-
Nah, sadly. Wish I had that much talent :)
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck damn that Gigabit and his supposed fucking up my xlive!
Maybe I'll pick it up again, reading Twilight Effect atm
oh well
gona finish my stream
And let me guess, there's Twixie clop in it?
the @ by their names
but I didn't like of maids very much, I thought was a bit eh..hard to feel
wasn't cheerilees garden that fic with all the child murder and shit?
and that we use colors
00,10the ones with @ or % infrom of there name
mine isnt working today s'all
You all scare me away from fics i swear :D
Not only that, the guy's Belgian. Like me. We're all a little messed up in the head :D
Child torture and murder.
Fics are great, I don't read gore
Maybe we should change the subject............:S
but*
I've read 8.5 million words at the moment-
i liek pie
And then there's a sequel, but the Mane 6 die in it.
I never read it, but I read his comments as to why he wrote it- sounded sane enough
A fic I could recommend is "My Roommate is a Vampire". No gore, no clop.
I just dont see how people can do it! x_x
:O

Ayn Rand has some interesting points, even if she ultimatly was betrayed by the very tennants of Objectivism that she espoused.

sometime si ahte you.....
Nitt, why not go in for computer programming?
hate*
11,02Mooooo ^-^
Brb guys.
11,01PillowPoni: Maybe I should.
11,01If the market's good.
Because there is a larger % of people with a programming degree (SE, CS, ect) then with the IT degree
11,01I learned computer languages on my own. I always wanted to take formal classes in college and grad school.
11,01I wanted a doctorate in meteorology.
i got an internship based on the fact i knew Cobol and damn near got a job based on it as well
11,01But due to untreated disabilities and a medical problem I had in 2008 - 2009, I might not be able to get one.
11,01My advisors didn't seem confident that I could.
11,01They wanted to push me towards getting a masters followed by a job.
11,01Or career.
13i would rifftrax
Damnit.
11,01Kawaii_icybeauti: I'm a Penn State graduate.
I was only still awake for Azkaban.
11,01It's why I have Nittany in my name.
speaking of rifftrax, what's the movies for tomorrow?
11,01I formed my nick Nittany Tiger when I was accepted to Penn State in 2007.

11,01MirrorImage: If I ever have a kid.
I dont want kids, then i have to pay for them
11,01And then move there if we decide to get married.
Well, as long as that's the case I'm gonna go get some sleep.
My parents met through the peace corps. Try that.
Night everyone.
11,01As long a Latvia isn't crappier than the US.
11,01Kandarihu: I have.
11,01It's awesome.
night Me... fuck
missed him
11,01Someone posted it in a Linked In group.
theres always skype though
Godzilla Wednesday :D
I blame my lack of sleep on my part-time job,
11,01So, if I go back to school, I'll do one of three things: Enter a Ph.D. program, go for a bachelors in IT or computer programming, or get certified as a teacher.
teacher certified is the backup plan for me
11,01I'll just need to seek an internship before I graduate.
11,01But it depends on how much I can do during school.
great company, and not just saying that because i work for them
11,01No. I had to move in with my grandmother back in PA.
11,01I did apply to a Sheetz store before I left, but they never even called me back.
Trust me, it's going to go from 105 people on a weekday to like 40 something.
i don't mean a store, i mean something like the corporate offices
*Would
yes
sure
11,01*tests
Balls to it goodnight everyone :)
11,01MirrorImage: Whatever. They pretty much determine if you're going to be a model employee or not.
if that were the case, i would have never gotten in
^
11,01And since I'm an introvert, I can fucking forget about being considered when they want outgoing people.
All this job talk is making me think that I'm a year away from legally being able to hold a job o.O
it's more about keeping the bits a flowing
All this job talk makes me a little depressed.
11,01PillowPoni: I'll stop.

You know one line of work that is desperately needed nowadays? Farmers.
I hope the economy bounds back before I have to start my job hunt.
Is the stream down?
11,01I really hope the economy improves.
11,01And wealth spreads around instead of the rich getting richer and poor getting poorer.
11,01Greed is ruining the economy.
No

Money is
Money is everything in this "democracy" we live in
greed is everything
