MASF123|The_Jinx: why is pinkie pie so pink?
Flyboy YES
Flyboy: because pink is the manliest color ever!

Snips n Snails are worst ponies. IMO.
No Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon are worst ponies.
Really?
I like Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon over them
how old do you think celestia and luna are
They remind me of every damn bully bitch girl that harassed me in grade school.
Over 100 years
1000
o.o
So does Gilda. I can't stand Gilda
/me hugs Jmo
Gold_Demona, you got bullied by rich girls?
/me slaps XAX around a bit with a large trout
:>
gilda shouted at fluttershy i really don't ike her :|
:<
Gold_Demona: bitch girl and yesgirl?
She made fluttershy cry, Gold_Demona
That is punishable by death :[
MASF123|The_Jinx: Not rich girls. What MadSurge said.
MadSurge: Yes, and I was always their easiest target. >:C
I have been buliied by those girls too but whatever it's MLP
bullied
Wow, really? All those people cannot take out ONE guy?!
Gold_Demona: I had trouble with male bullies, but girls always liked me :3
One Man Army
I've been bullied by both male and female.
MadSurge: Usually people get bullied by people of their own gender, I notice.
Everyone's an asshole.
hi
hi assole
i shouted in assembly ages abo i am a brony and 6 people stood dup and said the same and now we are best friends
hi XylemTube :)
I mean hi
Gold_Demona: So you're a girl?
Gold_Demona: it was only teasing anyway, and they grew out of it
XAX: Yesh
XAX LMAO
MASF123|The_Jinx: LOLWHATSFUNNY?
gilda is a chav. luna and celestia are the head and deputy head. twilight is the nerd. rarity is the transfer from the private school. fluttershy is the... shy one. rainbow dash is the chav pretending to be cool. applejack is the hard worker. pinkie pie is the weird one and of course, derpy hooves is the special needs student.
Gold_Demona: Awesome.
00,10Phase4, did you want to take over here?
00,02uh
00,02was busy doing tech stuff
00,02eh, what the hay, i can do this from windows. one sec
So Phase4, what are we going to do tomorrow night? :3
Flyboy: Derpy is more like the funny looking girl that is a bit weird but all round lovable :P
MadSurge: good point
MadSurge: Yesh

00,10well if you dont want to or are busy I can keep going
Phase4: Wah, what are we going to do on the bed? Pomf =3
00,10Just thought I would ask first
Gold_Demona: not fond of "special needs Derpy"
Phase4?
:(
00,02Sumica, it'll take me some time
00,02gota clean everything up
MadSurge: Me neither. My headcanon Derpy isn't special needs. Just derp-eyed and clumsy
00,0215 minutes or so
00,10ok I will keep going then
0.0 i wont even ask
Maybe forgetful at times
Hey Sumica. :)
Gold_Demona: pretty much what we've seen on canon then :D
Yes
Gold_Demona: also YESH, Derpy is just clumsy :D
what are war assets?
...
:(
Sumica, I heard that they made it so you don't NEED to do Multiplayer to get max assets.
Flyboy: a percentual for the ending...
Hey MadSurge

I wondered why Sumica's OC was a girl
Now I know

Howdy y'all!
oh, tf2
BOOO
AH!
o.O
00,10wth, this is not MvM
What's up with this MvM mod?
Sumica: normal servers are almost empty :D
00,02Sumica, ikr
00,10flutter medic
00,10ponies on a 3v3 seems unfare
Especially sense one can fly and one casts magic ;)
since*
00,10well I meen more of one team dont have one
oh i see
I know very little about TF2, let alone any modding or w/e
Phase4: Phase4 Phase4 has been tripled
Dat Twilight
AdamTheDuck: Day bipedal means of walking
Dat*
00,10twi plays like a medic iirc
00,10with a bit of magic bolts
Wouldn't Fluttershy make more sense as medic?
00,10she is a medic
Oh ok then
darn xP
No hands :D
Phase4: ima comming
/me thought that was TMI for a moment, realized what JRP actually meant.
00,02we need more players
It's strange watching Phase play something other than MvM for once lol
joing the game
Phase4: im comming
TWLIGHT STARES INTO YOUR SOUL
00,10man those models are freeky
AdamTheDuck: When she bothers to look up from her book ;D
00,10they need to use the pony skins from DA
Phase4: and my tf2 froze
Oh, that's right. I've gotten used to seeing PF2, so it's not strange to me.
00,02i sware that guy is teleporting
00,10what guy?
Twitchy twitcha twitchy twitch
/me almost thought Bronyville was starting for a second.
Ah, the Valve "pick up health" sound :)
/me wish it had.
wishes*
00,10Phase4 spends too much time looking at scoreboard
00,02i'm waiting for people to join
GAH! the first thing i see when i join is a bunch of creppy pony tf2 models
what makes us bronies who we are???
rigid_hoof: the fact that we are pretty good guys
rigid_hoof: We got fresh 'cupcakes'
perhaps
or the fact that we say "fuck off" to anybody is is an ass twords us
I like to think it's like being a Nerdfighter. If you want to be one, you are one. =P
instead of going on a tangent of rage
howdy everypony im back
Does phase have the pony voice pack?
Hello Thunder-Crescent
Howdy Thunder-Crescent
00,10scout hunter match eh?
00,10wait no
00,10a normal cart match
its rarity
vs twighliht
loose lips create very slow fights
twilights got this
00,02changing servers
00,10wait it's thursday
00,02its not fun with 4 players
That sounded almost like a Wilhelm scream.
00,10mvm time?
well, i guess ill see you guys laster time for school
Bye PsychoticDoc
se ya
00,10dat unfair team stacking
00,02i sware
00,02its just the pro's left on tf2 normal
dafack am i watching here just somepony playing tf2?
rigid_hoof, yup.
00,02his shotgun has nockback
Gotta' love staring at Phasepony in the middle of the screen
Aww he moved it
it was very distracting tho
00,02what the heck
00,02i was backstabbed during a rocket jump
gotta love tf2
That's tf2 for ya
Wells, fillies and gentlecolts, I've had a good time this evening, but this is saiyonara. Bye bye!
Goodbye tSpa - oh well...
00,02bbl
yay music
Phase4: GMOD?
i think he went afk
bbl - Be back later
so yeah he probably is afk
00,02back
00,02JRP, dont realy want to play gmod
Welcome back
but
00,02i love this music
why
00,02JRP, just doesnt appeal to me that much
00,02minecraft is similar, i will enjoy it once in a while
00,02but only once in a while
but you host a server with low ping
and not 213213231 ping
00,02that runs on my home connection
00,02the one i need for streaming :P
yesh
00,02so who's still here?
here
/me raises his hand
I am
Still here!
00,02yay~
Phase4: MVM?
00,02who's interested to know about the massive performance problem that is bronystate?
00,02killerpony7733, trying to not play it for a bit :P
o-O
massive performance problems?
00,02yeah
00,02when episodes air, we get a few thousand viewers
00,02who all refresh at once
00,02its a little harsh on the server
Phase4: If not alot cause some people have unstable connections and all
I can see that being a problem :/
00,02when this finishes doing whatever its doing, i'll show you some numbers
Yay numbers
NEW LUNAR REPUBLIC
FOR LUNA
/me salutes
00,02do not use what i'm doing as a guide for setting up websites
00,02this is hack together make it work
00,02if you were to actually run the commands i just run you'd be shot
00,02now, lets use apachebench to simulate, say, 100 users
00,02hitting the site 1000 times
I promise not to use this as a guide>_>
00,02immposibly fast
00,02AdamTheDuck, ^_^
00,02this may take a while
You know, the text is hard to read here.
00,02i know
00,02there we go
00,10phase, are you breaking the server again?
00,02"Requests per second: 26.37 [#/sec] (mean)"
00,02Sumica, local server, so yes but its ok
Lol cops are on you Phase :D
00,02XD
00,02that number there is the problem, 26 per second
00,10well at least he's not testing it on the live side server
00,02would never manage the kinda breakage i need over the internet
00,02during episodes we get thousands of hits a second
00,02well, during the stream switch
00,0226 is a bit small
00,02hence the performance problem
00,02i'ma try the same thing with a static file
00,025K Req/s
00,02limited by the benchmarking app
00,02it pegged a cpu, rest of them were near idle
00,02and i forgot where i was going with this
good morning Phase4
00,02morning TheKoreanBrony1354
No morning to everyone else on bronystate? :(
good morining Sumica
stupid rain
good morining AdamTheDuck
Aww yeaah
/me hugs TheKoreanBrony1354 :P
Kerbal is awesome
hugs back
type /me for the bracket removal
annnnnnnd back to killing all the Kerbals
good morning Shortcuit42
00,02lets try this rocket again
good afternoon thekoreanbrony1354
AdamTheDuck: Well it's afternoon and around 3 PM here
4pm in ol' uk
9am over here in "sunny" Florida
What is this monstrosity?
dat game lag
how is that thing staying upright?
It can't handle the awesome of Phase's rockets
Dat Kerbal's face XD
00,02somehow its alive
lolwut :D
Phase4: cool rocket
Yeah what EonMaster said, how is it still upright? XD
00,02magnets
Phase4: I blame luck :P
00,02'blame'
luck, magic, and just a dash of skill
pha
Phase4: whats the objective of this game
00,02go up
TheKoreanBrony1354: To kill as many Kerbal in the most creative way possible.
00,02prefferably to space
Kerbals*
00,02'in flames' is also an option
cooleo
My personal goal is to reach the sun
something tells me my 2007 laptop would implode trying to start this game
00,02this might achive kerbin escape
00,02Shortcircuit42, i've done that :P
00,02its quite boring actually
really
SPACE :O
dat buddingfrienship music
Pony Kart music :)
WOOOO
is iiiiiiit
whoops
Videogame musiiiiiic
I muted the chat and put on brodyquest, wow thats catchy. 0_0
Shortcircuit42: I'm not into MMOs, does it look any good? :D
00,02so
00,02that happened
00,02this thing can make the mun
Say Hi to Luna for me!
budding frienship is a harvest moon style pony game :)
DoctoDoctorWho: Adrien Brody, Adrien Bro-dy.
00,10dafak
bro day everyday
looks good, I harassed the graphics developer for about 2 hours on sunday
Sumica: Hi :3
00,02trying to turn this rocket is proving rahter foolish
00,02Sumica, i made it launch
Shortcircuit42: then it might be worthwhile :D
00,02somehow
mlp:online is an mmo
00,10gonna try for torsion gravity?
you were rolling natural 20s on the takeoff
MadSurge: walking to the sun and coming out with an electric guitar, Best Day EVER!
the developers awarded me the title muffin menace after I attacked kitmit (their spriter) with a muffin
DoctoDoctorWho: and still it's probably his average day (aka all days are best day :D )
incomming!
00,02dis will be interesting
00,02Sumica, nah
nuclear explosion!!!!!!!!!
nice music choice
00,02XD
LOL
00,02its climbing
i didnt know rockets could bend
00,10it broke?
lolwut xD
they shouldn't
00,02this one can hover
00,02Sumica, yeah
its defying gravity
cool
hey its derpy
MadSurge: thats an average day on par with the "like a boss" video
00,02seems to be falling again
00,10somthing about all those fins and the change to the way air works in .16
CALL THE SEAPONIES!
Shoo be doo shoo shoo be doo
This is good falling music
:D dat monstruosity
WOOOO
00,02weeeeeeeeeee
Um..... wut
WUT :D
this is rediculous
dizzy
Takes a while to fall don't it
lol screw physics
seems legit
00,02i have no clue what its doing
Pinkie took over :D
like how the rocket was falling slower than the shute
Phase4: You have to quit letting Pinkie pilot the rocket. =P
00,02XD
Gold_Demona: Pinkie would be the best airpilot ever :D
This stream is the best stream
MadSurge: She'd explode the aircraft... And then explode it again.
Well I'm off to bed, goodnight everyone :)
Night AdamTheDuck
night]
Night AdamTheDuck
Gold_Demona: and still, the aircraft would be fine afterwards :D
MadSurge: Yup
PhasePony will never make it to uranus.
Gold_Demona: and then explode it a third time which would somehow put it all back together, how? cuz pinkie
DoctoDoctorWho: LOL Yes, exactly. XD
So.... Phase4's just making a phallic symbol?
oh no, tripod
00,02....
im back
Next Phase4 animations should be doing the Batman glide and falling on his face, or getting into a car from the fifties and crashing into everything :D
will it fly
00,02XD
00,02Dr_Arcea, yeah
Dr_Arcea: but more importantly, will it blend?
00,02watch
Whats up everybrony
yes :)
wooooow
What? Your Mag is evolving?
Mag has evolved into Lyra
we have liftoff!
00,10of dear god wut
FLY PHALLIC SYMBOL
hello HiImSpike! We're watching Phase4 making impossible rockets
FLY FOR GREAT JUSTICE
00,10roto rocket is go
How does that even....
thanks MadSurge hows that going
00,10and I thought the one I got to fly like a helocopter was off the wall
Phase makes rockets only Pinkie can fly
00,02what this really needs is another stage
Nice my rocks alwasy crash and burn
It looks like Pinkie is the pilot, HiImSpike :D
00,02its clearly not tall enough
00,10it's fun breaking psysics in kerbal
rockets
yeah, needs to be taller
00,10needs cluster bomb srb's
00,02in all honesty i cant make it taller
Good morning, everypony!
00,02not without hacking save files
Physics? PHYSICS ARE FOR PUSSIES
00,02morning AJIsAwesome
well, do it anyways, make Pinkie proud
00,02if i make the outer rockets detatchable and add a few srb's
Phasepony just doesn't understand why his rocket won't work
00,02i could totally go to the mun with this
will it go to the moon and back again
00,02StinkomanFan, ikr
00,02Dr_Arcea, not in its current state
hi!
aw
00,02actually nvm
00,02it will probably get to the moon
would probably crash into the moon
Phase4: needs moar kaboom
00,02just cant land
Look at that sad face on him
LOL its pinkies flying bike 3000
00,02JRP, give it a minute :P
He's so depressed
00,02i cannot turn this thing
you say
00,02it just cannot be done
Phase4: youdontsay.jpg
should have added fins
Somebody needs all the RCS
That KErbal looks overjoyed to be in that flying deathtrap
Phase4: are you trying to land your ship on the moon???
As opposed to horrified while in the last one.
00,02HiImSpike, nope
He already gave Luna her dinner. :)
Or missle it to earth directly
Phase4: where is it
00,02?
shit buffer
now
WHY
NOW
WELP TIME TO FALL
now fire your death beam
time for an emergency water landing
KErbal is so fucking happy right now
00,02lol
lol falling music
00,02it ejected its engiens
00,02'we dont need those'
Love how the kerble is smiling
LOLOLOLOLOL
Must be Jebediah
THEY ARE ALL GONNA DIE! just sayen
WOOO

I wonder what the Kerbal's Sea Program is like...
more levels
Moar rockets!

00,02kaboom's are unplanned
00,02Shortcircuit42, me too ^_^
worked pretty well!
00,02mine broke
00,02bugger to get them to water
Phase4: theres somthing wrong with it
How do you link peoples names?
00,02JRP, i know
00,02it needs more rockets
00,02Shortcircuit42, press tab
Phase4: it dosent have enough rockets
Shortcircuit42:
Phase4: ooh thanks
Play Herbie Hancock! Rockit would fit so WELL with your failures
Anyone here made a land vehicle to explore kerbin?
Kerbin looks like a boring planet, no wonder they want to go to Luna
it has trees
would laugh if that rocket blew up in the hanger :D
HiImSpike: can't happen... yet :F
00,02brb
sweet jesus rockets
*:D
that looks awsome
So it has Fluttershys. I have five, maybe six Fluttershies in my yard.

Fluttershies are not hard to find
Not enough rockets
MOOOOOOAAR FUEL
i make chiptune stuff
more nuclear warheads!
I see bright things in this rockets futcher
ah spelling
00,10this can only end in tears
or with a bang
00,02almost done
PhasePony looks so close to crying whenever he fails
It's tragic really
hmmm... nah
i say we destroy kearth with a tactical nuclear missile and gloat in the face of al the dying and irradiated kerbals while we slowly mutate into superior beings
Phase4: needs more rockets
Flyboy: naaah that will be tooo easy
00,02oops
HiImSpike: oh and i almost forgot. all that... WITHOUT STRUTS
ded
TRAGEDY
weeeeellllll
it was the most perfect rocket ever
Flyboy: Now your talking

Phase4: thanks, thats awesome
Kerbel children... What do you want to be when you grow up. Kid: A Lawyer... Adult: Well you have to be an astronaut because that the only job we have now.

Werdna213: its me! payback137!
oh wow
Sumica: All I have seen is thousands of ships made to see if they "could" fly
00,10phase actaly takes his to orbit
00,02there we go
spaceships were made to fly
00,02plenty of fuel to spare
Werdna213: its been too long my freind
i know how r u doing

wtf Phase4
00,02?
Phase4: dat red line
00,02yeah
00,02it looks a few more orbits ahead than the stock config
fast forward a bit
00,02it thinks i'm gona orbit minmus, then impact the mun, then leave kerbin gravity
A two manned flight :o
He'll get there eventually
00,10wait, how did you get 2?
must ahve ejected somebody
00,10I dont think you can continue with a man outside
didnt know this version yet. anybody got a link?
00,10song or game?
00,02you can continue with people outside
3rd stage released
Sumica: song
Test
wassup evry pony im back
Okay, thought my chat derped.
rigid_hoof: Welcome back!
wave to luna everyone
ICE
Oh, it's the Mun
still on the rescue mission i see
waves to Luna
00,02forgot they changed hwo that works
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: ScrewAttack's 48 Hour Marathon
00,02gona need to actually change my orbit
wheres the other rocket
Phase4: whatcha listening to there?
00,02http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLmAlskhRZc&feature=autoplay&list=PLE1ED57BE70156AB0&playnext=26
Phase4: i have a TSFH playlist if you want to use it. but its up to you
TSFH=Two Steps From Hell
Phase4: knew that sounded familiar, there'S an awesome makkon vs jeffthestrier remix of that
00,02hopefully i dont explode
well if anyone need some good music to listen t (not saying that this isnt good music) then here you go: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF26AA922E33F2C44&feature=edit_ok
00,02i've never been very good at precision flight
please dont hate me
naw man u got dis
00,02Flyboy, after this song finished
Phase4: kk.
Hello everypony
So... we gonna see the Kerbals walking on the Mun or what?
flyboy i have a youtube to

CCCP: Hello!
Phase4: please shave
Hai AJIsAwesome
CCCP! :$
/me hugs MadSurge

Fraaaaaance
is he a friend madsurge?
hey flyboy
Phase4: night..uhh again
for real
CAREFUL
CAREFUL SPONGEBOB
do you start every mission with Space Oddity by david bowie?
00,02night JRP
CAREFUL SPONGEBOB

CAAAAAAAREFUUUUUL SPOOOOOOOONGEBOOOOOB
/me zzz
how much ram do you have phase?
00,0216GB
Phase4: quad to I assume
8 16
SPOOOOOOOOONGGGGGEBUUUUUBLE!
Ooh, is that Minmus?
hopefully the makers of kerbel go full star trek with what you can build
But star trek is soft sci-fi.
/me Zzz
MAKE A TIE FIGHTER NEXT!
soft core sci-fi?
make a nuclear missle!
oh and i'm back
:D
hi Flyboy
hi CCCP
ooh yay! TO GLORY!
hero fryboy
i know all of these songs :)
flyboy i have a youtube account
Space stations, moon bases etc fine. Warp engines no.
/me hugs CCCP
hi Maid_Rainbow
add me
/me hugs back
We're not Saving Luna, we're feeding her.
/me nuzzles CCCP
fine, no warp engines. but moon bases, space stations and maybe extra planets to visit would be cool
00,02problem wiht minmus is that its very easy to start going up again
yeah bye
HERE LUNA, GET THE NUMMY NUMMY KERBALS
00,02TheMaster, extra planets are my most wanted feature
I don't know anything about Minmus. Is the gravity there lower then on Mun?
Maid_Rainbow: Hello!
mmmmmmmm taysth kerbals
taysty*
StinkomanFan: this is minmus not mun luna is not here, someone else is though
AJIsAwesome : hello there
/me tackles Vivix
The second they add another planet you'll see people doing gravity slingshots.
Phase4 stream!
nemnemnemnem
Hii Jmo
Haaaai Vivix :3
you can't do that with the sun?
Maybe? I dunno. But where would you go?
is he landing on the moon?
minmus
mum
CANGRATURATION
YOU MADE IT TO URANUS
MINMUS
Hi again dudes :)
Same thing
Wow, this game has updated a lot since I played it
easyyy
Hai MegaMoonShine
00,02there we go
CARE
FUL
and we have touchdown
Wow he did it! :O
00,02363 meters away
Phase4: you've angered the queen with your countless visit, http://derpy.me/9fDaC run RUN FOR YOUR LIFE D8
now how to rescue our fellow cosmakerbels?
I suppose that, even with it's low gravity, you could still sling around Mun to make it to Minmus with less fuel.
Yaaaaaaaaay!
00,02not particuarly close but considering i traversed space
bueno....
00,02Spectrum_Rush, Argh
Phase4: Niiice
00,02wow
time to reascue
00,02was not expecting that Spectrum_Rush
all she needs is a hug
gah!
bye
Chrysalis <3
protectors of the kearth
00,10wait, this is a resque ship?
Protectors of the Kerbin
Oh man, I gotta get the update of this game-
I sorry Phase4 :(, i did warn ya before though
phew... i thought he was stuck then
And he dies on the moon
:o
00,10wow, low gravity
Yeah
FLY KERBAL
FLY
Really low
Is he stuck?
00,10so you go ram the other poor bastard loose or just jack his ride
they are both gonna get stuck...
00,02crap
00,02wrong button
Uhh... where is he supposed to be? Is this a mod?
:D
00,02i needed to press a different button
00,10woops
well now
uh houston. we have two kerbels stuck
send another ship
WHY DIDNT U DO THAT THE FRIST TIME
So what happened here? How did they get stuck there?
uh houston. we need a tow, pronto
naild it
00,103 if you count the one in the other ship
Walking spaceship
00,02the galoping space capsules of minmus
How is that moving?
mitamaking: magic
The capsule should have wheels on it :)
magic
Phase4: defender of earth?
00,10gyros are magic
Nyst: my attempts at making a landable car has been difficult
Dark_Horst: ah, i see that i'm not the only lover of TSFH
now if you can just build up enough inertia you should be able to break the gravity of minmus
lol. the capsule can walk
TO GLORY!
time to explore minmus
Can't you just add landing gear to the capsule itself?
00,10it's a space qwopsle
Flyboy: i'd be disappointed if you were
Send the 3rd kerbal to fix this
this is a rescue misson
So Phase4 you got to Minmus and saves some dude from dying alone. What are you gonna do now?
they'll edit this part out of the movie
lol
00,10now they can die together
00,02well
Imagine all the vomit in that capsule-
You move like the tentacles from day of the tentacle do.
Hi guys, we're watching some KSP?
00,02now i might try nudging that ship
00,02with my ship
Hi VenHur :)
00,10so you gonna go knock the other guy off the wing?
has anypony here seen the grand galloping collab?
That's all you can do now isn't it
do eet
this one would fit better for takeoffs^^
rigid_hoof: I have.
Wait, wait, WAIT. Is that the moon?! HAWLY SHEET!
Phase4: how do you steer his thrusters?
which song is this?
nice AJ
VenHur, no it's URANUS
VenHur: it's the SECOND moon!
what you need is iron man to save the day
00,02Dark_Horst, magic
00,10why not bump him with kerble
EonMaster: to glory by two steps from hell
thx
this game with co-op would be fun
Your fuel will run out before getting to Earth at this rate
epseically if they added lasers
Phase4: retrezct the landing gear so you dont damage when bump
space duels
00,10it's called moonbase alpha Dr_Arcea
opperation nudge is a go
00,02i dont know what i'm doing
mitamaking: capsule duels. it'd be like smashing eggs together to see which one survives
00,10no RCS again I see
aeoiuaeoiuaeoiu
you're doing the most scientifically precise thing you can
Welp, we're on the moon, but where's Woona?
00,10shame cause you could lateral with that
mitamaking: whoops, wrong ping
Phase4: Don't say that when you are on the moon
00,10not the mun.
VenHur: not the moon, Minmus
00,02good thing i'm on minmus
00,10this is the other satelight minmus
so the kerbel is stuck on the spaceship?
is he dead?
Maybe if his head wasn't so big
That is some really, really fine control.
probably soon....
roflol at the music to whats going on
I'm jealous! Compared to this I steer my rockets like a drunken whale!
00,10some realy good fine controll seeing as he is useing just gimbls and gyros
now entering orbit
Are you leaving him?
i whould like to see that
i am gooing to play moon base alpha is it any good
its good with people
The game could really use a grappling hook or magnetic hook.
and microsoft sam engaged
It's good fun for a few times. It's really realistic.
Vivix b busy? o:
awsome
00,10Nyst, there are some videos of people using landing struts as claws
It's also very slow and repetitive, but that's to be expected from something realistic.
Sumica: people are amazing.
Nyst: Well how many times do people go to a satellite of their planet?
Jmo what now?
00,10guy grabs another pod using the struts and take both the grab pod and the grashed pod backe to kerth
brace for it
You're quiet so it seems that you're busy.
o.O
Sumica: got a link?
05i has teh bored, suggestions?
or a name
old dr.who
00,10not off hand no
Wrek: wait for the crash
Sumica niiice- man I only have the old version without..anything really
oh god wat are u doing
00,10Wrek, arts =p
Wrek: F:NV?
Jmo oh no, I'm just chilling, reading and stuff
05FNV is tempting
Perfect music.
Oh fair enough o.o
oh gooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
here it comes
oh no
Oh god. Imagine this. Landing vessels, designed in such a way what each next lander can land ON TOP of the other. Make a massive tower of landers!
Wrek: MVM maybe?
Nyst: Oh my.
SO EPIC
00,10oh god
This can only end well
Each lander hooks into the one below it, making it a massive rocket again.
NO,NO,NOOOOOO
00,02crap
nooooooooooooo
Whatchu reading Vivix o.o
ABANDON SHIP
lol
save it save it
Wrek: Hm... Doctor Who?
MVM is fun, but I have to password protect it so people don't join before I do.
00,02man, some rcs would be nice
Kammerjunk: We got phases servers if we want to play
Was reading "What Princesses Need" Jmo, but now I'm just browsing. Going to save the update for FOE Heroes until later
00,10Phase4, why dont you bump him with the other kerble instead?
killerpony7733: Orly?
Just over half a tank of fuel left.
That's a good one Vivix.
The fuel has me really worried
Yeah, pretty funny, and serious
Indeed
Kammerjunk: Yep one of his servers currently which is the only i can see is up
00,02wait
00,02i have idea
Ideeeeaaaaaa!
00,02Sumica, dont want them both getting stuck
tractor beam?
do idea
Phase4: That is a bad idea
00,02Sumica, i have the debris set to 0
So like yesterday, we'll has another Rifftrax.
00,10should be ok if he has his pack on.
*have
00,10it might remove the ship if the pod is gone from it.
This music just makes this so intense
00,10good thinking
mitamaking: This.
very slow but intence
rigid_hoof: Very realistic if this really happened
You have two kerbals. In a kerban society they ship them to the mun for no other reason than to show they're better than you.
YESHHHH
It sounded like something out of LoTR...
lol yup
StinkomanFan: I thought you had 3
00,02DAMNIT
So now we build a rescue ship to rescue the rescue ship?
00,10time for third resque ship equiped with rcs
This will be fun.
soon you'll have a whole colony
of ships needing rescue
Sumica: or we could nuke the planet from orbit... just to be sure
can he wiggle his way out
How was he going home with just half a tank fuel, anyway?
Try equipping your third ship with a grappling hook made out of landing gear!
And so eventually all of Kerban Society went to Minmus
00,10still think the other guy could bump him out if he stays in rcs mode
you need to send jebediah kerbel
if at first you dont succeed, throw more stuff at it until you do
Jebediah can save the day
Can EVA'd kerbals run out of jetpack fuel?
00,10yeah
00,10I think it's refilled when they dock
Hello everypony and what be this
Ah.
I can only imagine the kerbal scientests getting so pissed off right now
I guess I will ask, how did it get stuck?
ram the ship with his body!
lowfn|: Phase's playing that Kerbal game.
I can't get over just how low the gravity there is. Is that moon made out of sponge?
Yes.
inb4 stuck #2
Hello lowfn| :)
death
wat
concussion
tap
trolololololololol
I wish we get more updates to this in the near future, i'm interested to see several citys Kerbal'ed, plus better texturing.
00,10bonk
Did he just spin around?
:(
:'(
Jump on top of his head!
Man this game looks fun.
there gonna get stuck......
This may work
yes? YYES?
00,02well
00,02shit
slide!!!
yes
victory!
lol
Yes!
yay
SEY!
DUN DUN DUUUN
YESH
YES
00,02i saved bill
EXCELLENT
or did the other kerbel get stuck?
00,10yay
You still have that other kerbal right?
is the other kerbal stuck now?
...So now you have TWO stuck Kerbals?
00,02now cammy is stuck
Did the other one get stuck?
epic win music
WAT?
00,10lawl
CALLED IT
Pfff hahahahaa
lowfn: SUOICILED SI SIHS!
wth is a kerbal?
the magic of kerbel friendship will save the day
SIHT* goddammit
00,10the little green guys
Yay, Bill Cosby is saved! Now let's go down the slope going Zip Zop Boopedy BOP!
CCCP: The little astronaut dudes are Kerbals
"I'm up, I'm up."
CCCP: This is a Kerbal.
Kerbals are the astronauts here.
Doesn't look stuck
oh
Kammerjunk: Sey
if only they could pick other kerbals up
Now /dance
Switch kerbals and check
ty Gold_Demona Kammerjunk
yay
success!
YES
No problem CCCP
YEEEEES
SSECCUS!
now to get all 3 kerbals bak to kerbin
00,10awsome
misson succes
Sorry mission control, the problem is fixed
you can stop building rocket #3 now
00,10see phase
So who were you rescuing
Wait a sec... GOD DAMN IT JEREMIAH! YOU LEFT THE ENGINE RUNNING!
00,10the one stuck on the fins
oh hey, thta'S the song used for the my little battletech loading screen
Anyone else singing Tobuscus' lyrics to this song?
00,10who>
I love the way they waddle.
Robot insect aliens~ Not to be confused with ladybugs~ Shoot at the ground~
Time to go home
So all three of them are safe now?
MY LITTLE BATTLETECH?!
00,02:3
they have to return to kerth
Is there room for three in that capsule?
00,10I think this might be a first
Dark_Horst: Tell me more
Shortcircuit42: wait a second
Phase4: as you arent going to use it afterwards, can you nuke the left over spaceship?
inb4 they die coming home
Phase4: Now we must get the kerbals back to kerbin!
hopefully there is enough fuel
00,02hmmm
00,10one mission coming back with crew from another
Looks like there's room.
Kerbals, write a letter to the Princess!
00,02seems kerbin is tidally locked too
we have retrived the stuck one and are now coming home
00,02Sumica, for bronystate yeah
Sumica I have seen a rescue mission before
00,02ONWARD
00,10same here Barbetos|AtWork
FOR GREAT JUSTICE
Phase4: While that might be deliberate; chances are it's just something that's not implemented yet.
Why did you have to send another ship to save him?
AND CUPCAKES
AND MUFFINS
FOR EQUESTRIA!
AND TSFH!
mitamaking, the other one was out of fuel and he was stuck in the fins
oh hell yeah
Half a tank of fuel...WILL THEY MAKE IT?
00,10he was stuck in the fins mitamaking
FOR NARNI-I mean...EQUESTRIA
TAKE OFF EVERY ZIG
best music for the return trip
00,02Nyst, what might be?
/)_(\
StinkomanFan: What about the other two kerbals with him or was it a solo mission
Phase4: the planet being tidally locked.
MOVE ZIG
whats the eta
mitamaking Solo
Shortcircuit42: there was a (quite good, imo) fafic that crossovered mechwarrior and mlp. somebody liked it so much that he made a concept of how a loading screen of a crossover game could look like
00,02ah
for great justice
00,10he was solo in a small pod
StinkomanFan: of course he got stuck
00,10this is a 3man pod
00,02Nyst, no, rotation is implimented
Dark_Horst: thanks for the info!
00,10seems he kickd one out on the pad though
00,02Nyst, its just that both moons are tidally locked
Phase4: interesting.
dark side of the mun?
00,10needs some major tom
Space Oddity by David Bowie plz
Do it!
Okay so this is the bit I don't understand.
DO IT
What have you learned abut solo missions?
00,02didnt even touch the outer tanks
How to get the trajectory of the rocket to be so, that the rocket and the planet cross each other at the exact same time.
00,02mitamaking, always have a spare rocket incase shit breaks
math
and magic
00,10it caculates alot of that
alright evry pony its been pleasent but i must bid farwell
on reentry u should play smile smile smile
00,10some of it you just play by ear
Later rigid_hoof :)
pahse4 could do the calculus himself
but then that wouldn't be very fun
00,10like if you are going to the mun
if one of you have silent hunter that could be a fun game to stream
TheMaster: Sure it would
or lunas theme
How does he know the planet will be there? All it shows is a blue line.
00,10you orbet kerblin and just as the mun is riseing you burn at it.
or hers sisters
This looks like a good place to land
00,10when the line changes to yellow he has an intercept corce set
Is it going to overshoot?
00,10red is a colision
do they have a exosphere on kerbin?
00,10woops
Oh that is NICE!
what line?
Oh mai
And now gravity takes him in
inb4 horrible crash
no resistance from the atmosphere?
00,02might be a bit fast
00,10there is resistance but no friction
Next he'll make a perfect landing on the launch platform. Wouldn't surprise me.
Man where are the rockets going to land
Like the ending of Two Thousand One
mitamaking: you can track those
00,02nvm, seem to be slowing
00,10they will explode on impact
i bet 5 bits for a splashdown
00,10the rockets that is
Phase4: SPIN
splashdown is best down in this case
00,10he will know where he will land if he zooms out
Kerbals like to put explosives in everything. Anything without a parachute to slow it's decent will explode.
Phase4: the kerbal in the middle "some kerbals just want to watch the world burn"
00,10including kerbals
00,02thats jeb
football mode
00,02he's always like that
figures
Actually, even the parachute has explosives in it.
You spin me right round
Flyboy: HE's just happy not to be stuck on the moon anymore
Jeb has no fear
Do you think my name is a noob name?
Dearly, my frank, I don't damn a give.
JEB FEARS NOPONY
00,02very calm re-entry this one
00,10snap
should put some more 420s and 'noscopes'
Sumica: don't joke
and xXx
Very classic sideways reentry.
00,10he's done it before
dang
00,10big chute is twice the force at half the tensile
I think i am changing name to MilkyWhiskers, but who else has {CapTaIn} before his name? (It is a clan name yes)
it looks like its orbiting 0.0
Yeah the parachute icon is yellow.
a pony clan?
00,10yelow meens midphase deployed
{CapTaIn}MasterBoss: No one I've seen.
it better open
00,10landing strust go yellow too when in mid opening
TheMaster, yes and no but i am recruiting real pro gamerz
00,10chute will fully open around 500m
^Hahahahaha
uh, I don't think this is that kind of stream
Kammerjunk that is what i mean XD
Ah. I thought it meant they were under greater then average stress.
Where is your speed?
good
Trees everywhere!
Above the blue circle.
hopefully the parachute won't detach
00,10speed is above the ball
Testing 1234
KERBAL SHALL LIVE
Yesh
the only game i'm pro at is Europa Universalies 3
7.8 kph
That isn't bad
Oh man the music fits so well.
^
TheMaster: I'm a fairly average and ok tribes ascend player
:)
Nyst: Yeshhh
:O
00,10lands in a tree
yay
PEEEERFAICT
sucess!
TheMaster: The only game I'm pro at is Barbie's Magical Adventure Party 3.
Unfortunatly you landed in Ghana
You have... Waait for it.... SUCCESED
Like a leaf on the wind.
00,02i call that a success
that game is too l33t for me Kammer
And they all lived happily ever after
Phase4: I'm taking a note here, Huge success :3
00,10and they all lived to die on the next flight
yay call pinkie and vinyl its time to party
That is one massive rocket, jeez!
00,02and with that i go to bed
Wow, I need the full version-
Phase4: night night
00,02killerpony7733, oh you
Night Phase4 :)
night
YAAAAAAAAAAY
Phase4: Yes oh me :P
Niight Phase4
HAPPY END
good night
good night sir!
Phase4: Night! Sleep well!
00,02cant belive i managed to get those craft soo close
00,02i meen i screwed it up and flew away but still
00,02need to designe lighter craft at some point
What time is it over there, anyway?
play this when i sleep
00,021
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pBd3QXt20I&feature=plcp
Oh.
Well, then go to bread.
Put wheels on a full fuel tank; drive it around like you're playing happy wheels.
ROFLOL
now what
We wait till another mod will stream
how long will that take
Depends
on?
If mods are awake
And have stuff to stream
Mods asleep.
Post humans.
if I was a mod i'd be streaming one of my favorite games. Silent Hunter 3.
You can dream
if you've ever watched a movie called Das Boot, its like that
No, but I've watched Die Welle.
That was pretty good.
no stream?
though instead of hunting merchant ships i'd probably go hunt destroyers
CCCP: Stream is ded.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D-QD_HIfjA
If the stream is that that means you can post video links :p
anyone seen the old transfromer movie
80's > 2000's
^
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJDnJ0vXUgw
no stream?
g1
/me hugsgies Major i wub that song
I prefer Beatles over Rolling Stones.
That's not to say I don't like Rolling Stones, though.
this is what its like to play silent hunter 4

We should watch "The Wizard"
for movie night
CCCP: I've never heard of it.
To the newsletter! *Cue Batman music*
Crono_brony its pretty bad
quick find that sound clip
CCCP: Why is that?
Crono_brony: It's a 100 minute long Nintendo commercial, basically.
Crono_brony it just is, its an hour aand a half long nintendo commercial
Stream! :O
Woo!
fallout :D
dat stream
ahh, good
:o
the heck the game is this
e.r..

Werdna213: F:NV
the stream noticed we saw it
CCCP: Wow. that's.... odd for a movie.
oh
God, I hate Mr. New Vegas.
O.o
and that was the mysterious magnum
^
Crono_brony well it pretends to have a story, its slightly entertaining actually but still really bad
CCCP: So, we'd just watch it for the laughs? (on how bad it is)
Crono_brony pretty much
CCCP: XD
This song is so chill.

/me fluffs all the pillowa in chat
Crono_brony: That's another relaxing song.
Werdna213 try not to link videos during stream
Perfect end to For Lack of a Better Name.
oh sorry my bad
Kammerjunk: Exactly, that's my thinking music.
:(
Werdna213: Hmm your name seems new, Are you by any chance a newcomer?
I met a person that thought all Fallout 3 and New Vegas music was made for the game -_-
not really
lol
Werdna213: Ah
where is this
I just put on No Words by Replacer. That guy is underloved.
CCCP: Oh wow.
i thought it was kinda funny
i whatched chats on youtube and i been here before a long time ago
Kammerjunk: I know. He's one of my favorite artists.
Werdna213: How long?
CCCP, I've heard people joking around like that a lot, that they hear 50's music and identify it as Fallout music.
idk really
Question: Is ED-E pronounced Eddie or Eat E?
i belive to watch the mystery on the friendship express

I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars!

HOLEY CRUD
Quick, fetch the battlesaddle!
WHAT HAPPEND TO HER
ohai everypony!
ohai Biglaw :)
Werdna213: she is a goul
Werdna213: She is a ghoul
Werdna213: Drugs
define goul in this game
Wrek is playing FANV?
i knew i forgot a letter somewhere
or FA3?
NV
Biglaw: nv
okay
Does that music play every time he pulls the gun out?
MegaMoonShine: yes
Werdna213: Someone who has been exposed to too much radiation
That's pretty cool :D
oh
Dovah: Why
Why does a revolver sound like a god dammed cannon?
ouch
lowfn: because that is an epic gun..
Dovah: Makes sense.
Golakka: you never heard a magnum revolver fire before, did you?
hello
o_o
Hai SirGanjalf
hi SirGanjalf
Is this the regular FNV or some DLC
Hallo SirGanjalf
?
Ive heard a few types of weapon fire, but being a brifag, those are few and far between
hunting shotgun. loved it in nv. less a gun, more a multipurpose tool of death and destruction
SirGanjalf: Regular and most likely with DLC on it
This is a vanilla area
especially with the shotgun surgeon perk and gun runners arsenal addon
O_O
Ma leeegs
O.o
o_O
It reminds of that Hotel from "Shining"6_9
My Legs!
This is a random phrase that you have just read.
Master's Army? Dat first Fallout reference.
Wrek: do you have any idea why music plays when you pull out that pistol? :P
Wrek: Oi have you updated your tribes as of late?
GIANT BUGS
Major: Sounds like the Mysterious Stranger perk sound.
pop
i've had pet mantises...
Major: It is a rare item, the mystterious magnum
*mysterious
MLP_Brovakiin: ah okay :P
i found cazadors surprisingly easy to kill with a shotgunn skilled character
Wrek: so did you ever look for the Holy Hand Grenades in this game? :P
They are generally easy to kill. But hell they are annoying
cazadores = poachers?
killerpony7733: if cazadors are easy to kill, you picked the wrong difficulty
killerpony7733: they're usually worse than deathclaws
Dark_Horst: Depends on how you spec and what weapons you pick
Old World Blues makes them much easier to kill
SirGanjalf: cazador is the Spanish word for "hunter", some of which could also be poachers. =P
I wish I had FA NV or FA3 :I
killerpony7733 shotgun surgeon, upgraded hunting shotgun and magnum rounds work
killerpony7733: what did you use?
oh, thx Gold_Demona
No problem
Dark_Horst: Mostly gatling laser or with the gun runners arsenal gatling laser/plasma gun
well everypony i have to go
bye bye
Bye Maid_Rainbow1 :)
Goodbye Maid_Rainbow1
Dark_Horst: I mostly go energy weapons
bai maid...
:D
:(
killerpony7733: problem is, gatlings are usually effective middle to late game. cazadors are everywhere
killerpony7733: Same here.
To hay with these russian duck face ads
We are the champions my friends!
Dark_Horst: Still don't have a huge problem with em. TBH
Well, I gotta be a good house wife and go clean the house. I'll see y'all later. :P
though the day i found the avenger gatling, there wasnt really any enemy that gave me trouble
Holla everypony! :)
Dark_Horst: Well add that, I use enclave power armor
And we'll keep on fighting - till the end -
Goodbye gold_Demona
We are the champions -
CCCP No duck face is better than another, they all suck
cya Gold_Demona

GilDash|Gaming: Hello!:)
Dark_Horst: Again depends on gear and weapons
has this come down to say hi, bye, quotes, and emotes
GilDash|Gaming: still gaming I see :P
Overencumbered? Eat 20 pounds of food!
Werdna213: what has?
Dark_Horst: And having the perks that helps with damage or killing insect enemies quicker
Major: But of course. :)

Werdna213: then you're here at the wrong times
oh
ok
dat Werdna
what
well then it looks like im going down...
GilDash|Gaming: just playing long enough to avoid the hunters? :P
Werdna213: if we start debating something, you can be sure that it comes close to war
roflol
Major: What? :S I've put 60+hrs into this one playthrough, if that's what you mean? :S
rolling on floor luaghing out loud
GilDash|Gaming: No I mean the "hunters" :P
Werdna213: I'm well aware what that mean
ok just in case not all people do
Wrek:Now go and kill the Legendary Deathclaw :D
Major: I don't know what you're on about. :S
hey cant u find aliens in thi game
GilDash|Gaming: nvm >_>
Werdna213: One time if you got the wild wasteland perk
Werdna213: only with the wild wasteland perk
05MLP_Brovakiin: i have already killed the quarry and dead wind cavern
ok
05i killed clawy in lonesome road aswell
05not many deathclaws left
Wrek: what about the unmarked location with the enclave armor?
Oh :S
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Music: So Great and Powerful : E48
Dark_Horst: Oh hell that place. That wasn't fun to visit the first time
Wrek: he number of deathclaws that spawn there depends on your level. i had near 3ß0
*30
05Dark_Horst: foudn the helmet, gona try and find the armor now
05thing is ive never found it

08,01but my favourite changeling is queen chrysalis
im going to the airshow this year, we should go for a drink!
08,01Major: there are things in there that should ne'er see the light of day
Wrek: it's an encounter though, chances are it bugs and the corpses along with the main pack dont show up. save and reload should fix that, though then you might find yourself surrounded by deathclaws. lots of them
happened to me
:P
lowfn: Changeling #26

I really can’t stay,
Baby, it’s cold outside
I’ve got to go ‘way
so these legion fucks arent so random after all
Baby, it’s cold outside
i encountered the exact same patrol while looking for the armor
CCCP is on drugs again
The evening has been, I’ve been hopin’ that you’d drop in
So very nice...
I’ll hold your hand, they’re just like ice
by the way what armor is he looking for
just asking
My mother will start to worry
Werdna213: remnant power armor
enclave
wich is
Hey beautiful, what’s your hurry?
And father will be pacing the floor ...
Listen to that fireplace roar
So really, I’d better scurry (Beautiful, please don’t hurry)
Werdna213: what remained from the old world usa
Well, maybe just a half a drink more...
ahh
CCCP: I fear for you
Put some music on while I pour :)
MLP_Brovakiin, me too.
i not a big fan fallout
Nice view
The neighbors might think (Baby, it’s bad out there)
?
?*
oops
Werdna213: they're part of a military organization that fled to an oilrig when the bombs fell. isolated from the rest of the wasteland and it'S mutation they had this idea that for civilization to rise again, only pure, unmutated humans must be allowed to live
Werdna213: ergo, they're evil purists
Say, what’s in this drink?
ahhhhhh
CCCP: whats in your drink :P
that makes sense i think
No cabs to be had out there...
I wish I knew how (Your eyes are like starlight now) :)
Werdna213: though, they dont appear in nv. but in fallout 3, they play a major role
sup
So whats so important about this area?
To break this spell...
ok i am with u so far
I’ll take your hat, your hair looks swell ;)
Hey Everypony!

Hackalot: Well are you new to BS?
Oh baby, don’t hold out!
So whats up there?
Yea
DAT STEALTH
Oh, but it’s cold outside!!!!
Hackalot: Alright read the rules yet?
Plus I'm a newfound brony
I simply must go (It’s cold outside)
Hackalot: When did you become one?
And yes I read the rules
Hackalot: Welcome to BS then
Like a couple of days ago
My sister will be suspicious... gee Your lips look delicious
Follow the rules and your gonna have fun :P
Good to know :)
My brother will be there at the door...
Hackalot: Well welcome to bronystate! Hope you have a great time here!:)
amused i notice that wrek is using the exact same tactic and weaponry against those deathclaws as is did :)
DAT HEADSHOT
anti material rifles tend to be effective
o_O
I've been trying to fill my iPod Touch to the brim with pony stuff...however I'm missing a element
The ability to read fanfics offline...
Dark_Horst: haha so do I, it is either this or the alien blaster :P
boom head shot
Hackalot: What fanfics have you read?
My Little Dashie, Cupcakes (Never want to read that AGAIN *shivers*), And Spike's Rainbow Dash
It's that one where Rainbow Dash tries to make Spike fall in love with him
*her
i read my little dashie it was sad
Ah Spike's Rainbow Dash, how I can't wait to see the outcome.
Hackalot: I read MLD, and I didn't cry. Not sure if I have no feelings >.>
Hackalot: I can see why you wouldn't want to read Cupcakes.......*shiver*. I'm reading this fanfic about Blueblood that was posted on Equestria Daily.
Biglaw heretic :[
I havent read my little dashie. i heard it breaks your soul and makes you sad forever. xD thats how sad it is
i have never read cupcakes but with the reviews and comments its been getting i dont know if i want to
^
CCCP what?
I liked cupcakes ^^
I can't wait to see the outcome either...but like I said...I really want to read fanfics on my iPod Touch 4G and then save them for Offline Reading later
Biglaw: Same here. It's a great fanfic, but I didn't cry at all. I was sad, though.
^
pony_4484: WHAT O_o
people that liked cupcakes only like it so they can feel cool, its a bad fic even for Grim Dark ones
read mld then cupcakes
i didnt cry ether but i was sad, it felt like my hreat was crying
Apparantly I sound like microsoft sam when I talk 0.o
O_O?
I did the other way around...Cupcakes then MLD
^^ nah. i just like violence.
Hackalot: Sorry, I can't help with that.:( You can ask some other people, though.
it works
pony_4484 my point made :3
Happy tree friends is worse than cupcakes. 0-0
pony_4484: that show is awful
Its funny though
happy tree friends is funny for the shock but thats all
;A;
I am cool with violence, but I could never bring my self to mix it with MLP
Also I just happen to be on Ponychat IRC on my Chromebook!
^^ lumpy is an idiot. he always gets everyone killed
lumpy is my hero
MLP_Brovakiin: Same here. I can never see that happen IMO.
never seen happy tree friends and never will
Flippy is my hero >:)
honestly i would rather watch cupcakes then read it, thats how fuck up my mind is
/me hugs pony_4484
sweet apple massacre was just fucked up.
Dovah: No, you're not f***** up. You're just different, and that's fine by me.:)
Dovah well there's a flash animation on newgrounds of it -.-
what about the season 2 wedding episodie
the flash wasnt bad.
I wouldn't read gorefics, but if you read them that's fine.
AJIsAwesome: my sister laughed at cupcakes... and she's 10...
wtf
she IS fucked up
Dovah: Did you ask her why?
AJIsAwesome: what....
when people reacted to the royal wedding it was weird...
Dovah derp
Biglaw: What do you mean?
Dovah why did you let your sister read cupcakes? WTF
people were all like: OMG WTF BBQ ZOMG
Anypony else know some good Pony stuff to put on my iPod Touch...FYI It's Jailbroken
Thats like the time derpy was introduced
AJIsAwesome: I meant that to go to Dovah, I derped when I read the person who said it
well the hacksaw joke was pretty funny
you have to admit
yeah
well i have one hold on
CCCP: I didnt! i mentioned mlp then she said when she was on youtube she watched it 3 times...
I do have to say, Cupcakes has become way too popular. Most non-bronies become haters because Cupcakes is a popular video on Youtube
Story of the blanks wasnt THAT bad...
this is a good brony song http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPfMb50dsOk
Dovah O_o
pony_4484: I read a story called Frienship is Tragic, that made me cry
pony_4484: why you no hug back? :[
Dr_Arcea: Sorry, no video links during stream.
;~;
oh sorry
It was pretty cheesy. story of the blanks wasnt scary...

SOO CUTE
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB1n3XGViOM
No available in my country sonicandmario85 :(
The world could end at ANY second. It could end because a black hole has just shot a burst of radiation. It could end because of a meteor, it could end of sudden combustion. We all live on the brink of death every second of our lives.
D'AWWW!
now I'm depressed lowfn...
Hey stallions ever heard of StumbleUpon?
I'll find more D'aww
ekips: Why? We survived this long without being destroyed! Its pretty impressive to me.
There's a stream guys, just because Wrek isn't here doesn't mean you can post video links.
AJIsAwesome Mods ARe asleep!
but to come so far just to see that our effort is, in the end, pointless...
Hackalot: Hmm?
Well some guys are working on a StumbleUpon for Bronies! It's known as TrotUpon and it needs help adding sites to its database
Werdna213: I do.
Just about everyone does Werdna213
lowfn:if our planet ends it will probaly get life on it again since its in the goldylox zone and all life will reform if a comet hits it because cells are in comets
do you know why?
i have his page up if u guys wan to see some clips
ekips: Every end leads to a new beginning.
lowfn: You've seen It's About Time, right?
AJIsAwesome: Yes.
Werdna213 Best not cause i have seen 99% of not 100% of all his clips
YES there is life in the universe in other galaxys and solar systems
lowfn: You know the moral behind it, right?
yea
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yfs4FKbJzL0
13MadSurge: send what
lowfn: It saddens me to know that I won't see the new beginning
sorry Shizuka
sonicandmario85: It would be stupid not to accept that.
just because were the only life planet in the solar system doesnt mean theres none far away out there
how about Pony In A Box Productions
OMG prepare your hearts: http://derpy.me/87Fxp
Nintendo decided to get out of the magazine business I guess?
YourLittleDahie: Stop it, my heart cannot take it 6_9
and stick to the Internet now for news
ekips: But... it will still happen. THATS what keeps me from being saddened about the end.
http://www.n-europe.com/news/nintendo-power-to-close-after-24-years
YourLittleDashie: HNNNNNNGGGGGG

MadSurge: Yep. Same here.:D
Hopefully
Random question time! Which do you like better: Cake or Cupcakes?
I cant say i like one over the other in general...

I personally like cake more than cupcakes. They're both delicious, but I like cake more for some reason........:S

LadyFluxum: I'm doing pretty good. How about you?:)
I'm doing pretty good
Bronysith: :S
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: The Garden
that's gonna be a pretty rifle, i'd say
Bronysith: That is why I don't :S
05this pose will work I think :D
Thanks for asking. Today was a good day
Wrek: very nice man
is the rifle in front of or behind her neck?
Is it Twilight?
:D
MaxTheBrony: Yep.
it is
lolz
Wrek, what ya drawing?
ah k
brb 5 mins, bog
<3 pyro
and scout
brb gotta go do some...business
O.o
Bronysith: Thanks for that :|
A gunblade?
part of me imagines twilight wouldnt use a rifle
more... Cannon...
So thats what BerryPunch is for, huh.
Oh my.... they are remaking Riven!
Really?
I can finally complete a part of my childhood
LadyFluxum on LoL?
Hey everypony. I see we are speedpainting.
Heya Flootahshy its not speedpainting :d its regular
Hey Flootahshy :)
Its Wrek Painting :d
MegaMoonShine: Yeah, they made a kickstarter apparently. Same game, better graphics, aslo freeroaming
MaxTheBrony: It's not? Wha?
Its not speedpainting, Wrek is just this awesome :D
Hallo Flootahshy
If this is speedpainting then wrek is a pretty damn slow painter
haha :P
AJ is Awesome, actually Zecora's the Demoman and Spike is soldier.
Takes one hour just to make a line
That's cool LadyFluxum :)
Havent played any Myst games
Alchemist: Riven is the one and only if you plan to do so
Just.... keep a piece of pen and paper net to you
next*
ded?
I wish i had someone to play Tribes Ascend with right now. Being in normal matches with no friend to help is bleh
Twilight, I could imagine leveting this and firing it with magic or something
http://usarmy.vo.llnwd.net/e2/-images/2008/10/15/23835/army.mil-2008-10-15-073924.jpg
Alchemist: It's a point and click adventure with an IMMENSE lore behind. No, items. Just pure frustrating puzzle solving
lolwut
StinkomanFan: Whoops...forgot.:$
And you don't play as a chracter. You play as Yourself
IT's ok man.
Someone was streaming Riven here once
MegaMoonShine: No way! WHo did?
05love riven <3
I think it was wrek
MegaMoonShine: shizu
Vivix|Stuff so much stuffff ;~;
Wrek, you cool. You cool
05and it was shizu
Oh
Ah yes, I remember
Never cleared that game. Haven't touched it in like 13 years.....
I'm so getting the remake
Jmo: I WAS PLAYING SKYRIM <3
brfb
So I finally got a new internet connection set up in my apartment yesterday. Anybody know how long it's gonna be crap?
Vivix|Stuff DAT SKYRIM >:3
LadyFluxum: Im reading bout Riven on Wiki and it looks good. Do I need to play the previous myst games to enjoy it?
Alchemist: There IS a big ammount of lore but i never played Myst before i played Riven. You get a book at the beginning with everything you need to know
Basically, there is a race of people under the earth writing books that acts as links to other worlds/diemnsions. One of these worlds is Riven that is falling apart due to poor writing of the letters in the book
I wonder if anyone has Ponified MXC from SpikeTV
LadyFluxum: I think Ill give it a try. I just dont want to look up lets plays about it on youtube. It would spoil the fun.
Wait, wrek stopped :S
Alchemist: Just a heads up. It requires alot of your attention and you need to take notice to small details
05MegaMoonShine: hm?
LadyFluxum: I will have my pen and paper ready :)
Just noticed the drawing seems to have stopped
Alchemist: Go with D'ni. Catheryn needs you
Are you doing something else right now?
Nevermind
o.o
05think that mane will work?
I'm watching MXC while I chat on the Ponychat IRC
05guise?
oh shit son
i haven't seen MXC in years
looks fine
Looks good to me
btw do we have some trilogy planned for tonight? or any movie?
Wrek: Looks fantastic.
Hey everypony
saw that the newsletter is jammed up and I was out of the loop
Serenity: Hey, Serenity!
Halla Serenity
if that thing fires, would the mane be blown outward?
i
i'm wondering becasue, quite frankly, i have absolutely no idea^^
05if she fires the longsword the mane would be blown back yes
05but in this shot she is aiming post already firing
05hence ruffled
Dark_Horst: I think she's just holding it up, and the mane is being blown back by the wind.
Heya everypony. Refreshed the Internet and am typing on a shifty iPod
Hey Serenity :)
Dark_Horst: if the bullet is big enough and fast enough it could create a vacuum behind it and "suck" the mane front :D
have you heard of facade?
broscience ftw
nope
is it some game?
*forward*
ya
Hey everpony on an iPod atm
is she supposed to hold that thing in telekinesis?
Dark_Horst: Yes.
that might hurt. hope it has some serious recoil dampening
i cant really explain it, but basically you go into somebodies house and you talk to them and stuff
Dark_Horst: I always think the horn is more of a medium in which unicorns can concentrate their magical powers onto, so I don't think it'll hurt her.
i love my civ class in college
Bronysith: How is it?
awesome
the professor is nice and passionate for her job
Bronysith: Sweet!
looking good so far Wrek :)
i think i just had an idea on how to secure the rifle
Wrek: explosive rounds?
Test
yes AJIsAwesome ?
Okay, nvm.
Hello everypony :)

fuck sake wrek you drunk cunt
Hi Everypony, I was just wondering if anypony knew the movie selelction for this week? Without the new letter I can never tell if there is one or not. Sorry to be a bother.
pony_2404: They haven't said.
Can I safely assume there will be one though? Or do I have to change my friday night plans?
pony_2404: You're not a bother. It's okay to ask questions.:)
Well rest assured there will be a movie night,
pony_2404: I'm not sure. You can ask the mods if you want to.
Dat Vivix b finished adventurin'
Okay. Thank you killerpony7733, that is awesome! And thank you AJIsAwesome for answering me!
Yess, mate
I also, Jmo, read about Wasteland 2 today, so I'm pretty excited
pony_2404: No problem.
Only just today?
o.o
they got a 2.9 million dollar kickstarter budget, and it's most of the F1 and F2 guys making a sequel to Wasteland-
yeah, I just randomly found it on wikipedia
Pretty--elated, even if it's not Fallout, it looks damn cool
Brb
Someone is excited
/me grins while shaking
/me slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
dat metal...Is it norwegian or swedish?
/me weeps
YES:
Vivix: I just now found it on Wikipedia aswell.
WREK IS DRAWING.
Dat reaction^
Welp
I'm listening to master of puppets, I'm going to go back to that.
Also, does anyone here have a brony teacher?
lowfn|Minecraft: Like what you see? I''ve never played Wasteland, but- it sounds like a cool game
Emil: I could only dream.
i am listening to bronyville
Kawaii_icybeauti: Is it rare?
Emil: I bet it is. But if I had a brony teacher...ehmagawd.
Kawaii_icybeauti: Am I alone with having one then? ;.;
o.o
Emil: WAIT YOU HAVE ONE?!?
wtf I just hallowed out an entire mountian down to bedrock and still no slime....
Kawaii_icybeauti: Yeah.
Emil: Glomp him courtousy of bronystate.
Kawaii_icybeauti: *her
Emil: How did you find this out..That's probably the coolest thign ever.
Who is wrek drawing?
chat derp?
It'was alright, but yeah, he was a nerd and kinda liked--saying weird things, fun teacher
yes yes it did
Chrysalis: Twilight
Kawaii_icybeauti: I was wearing my Pinkie Pie T-shirt, and she asked why.
seems a bit... pink for twilight
Jmo: it's a tiny series, so you could totally do that, some of the episodes are like--7 minutes long
or is that just a trick of the light
Eh it's only 3AM, I'm gonna go through it now.
What day is it?
wrek, what the hell are you drawing?
Kawaii_icybeauti: She then said she was jealous and had spent the summer watching through all the season after seeing it on the news here in Sweden.
Emil: I bet you guys went into asking each other who is best pony.
/me is too lazy to hover over clock with mouse
Golakka: Twilight
/me slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
Kawaii_icybeauti: Didn't get to that, we had to go eat lunch.
/me is wearing fisherman clothes, is immune to trout
I got thst Ponies47... but what
Sonova.
Vivix weak to rain though
oh yeah...but I'm inside, right?
TAKE THAT!
Emil: And ask her if she's ever heard of bronystate.
As long as Jmo don't got a hose, I'm safe
Not if I drag you outside.
*SHe
Kawaii_icybeauti: Might do.
**No he never mind
god dammit Ponies47, more TF2 shit
Golakka: Hey I like TF2 D:
Fact.
It's weird, I can't watch people play video games.
Twilight is best magician of the living ponies, now that's fact
Vivix: Yep.
Kawaii_icybeauti: Why not?
I watch people play games more than I play games nowadays- I just like doing other stuff while watching
Emil: I don't know, it's weird.

Dovah: Have you tryed any tutorials?
MLP_Brovakiin: yup

Pinkie_Brony: I'm not sure. They haven't said anything yet. I'm pretty sure there's a movie.
MLP_Brovakiin: wtf is that?
It sucks, whenever I click on a tab, I come back and the stream is messed up.
Pinkie_Brony: Did that link work?
Hello Kawaii_icybeauti! How you've been?

AJIsAwesome: I love it :D
Dark92Enigma: Yes.
Just asking......
I knew it...
Dark92Enigma: Can't you see that?
Wrek: It's coming along nicely.
The horn, the color, you know?
It took me a while to figure it out
LOL
I see.
lol
I can't wait till this is finished.
Don't get your hopes up.
/me is listening to ''PUT THAT COOKIE DOWN'' remix
So, do I need to make an account for this website or did I just have to type in my name like I did and its done?
It's sad to think that the outsiders think we're all a bunch of cloppers when we have many talented artist, musicians,etc.
Pinkie_Brony: Just type in.
also with the slime thing. can they spawn on peaceful cuz all my weapons are broke now...
Emil: Sweet
Kawaii_icybeauti: Tough love, sugarcube.
Pinkie_Brony: It's really simple.
http://theadmin.co.uk/ScrSnp/g5B7SN.png
Emil: I guess so
Kawaii_icybeauti: Ikr, what is normal anyways, by whos definition?
*Whose
Chrysalis: Oh, Tekkit?
Chrysalis: that's insane! :O
Chrysalis: Then you will NEVER have enough stuff.
Pinkie_Brony: If beung normal means being guido and saying "swag" and "yolo" being normal aucks
Chrysalis: Looks very high def
oh god not
tekkit is terrible
custom mod set
Kawaii_icybeauti: It's because they're being judgemental and closeminded.
http://theadmin.co.uk/ScrSnp/g5B7SN.png
Chrysalis: I see.
oops relink
I REALLY hate YOLO.
AJIsAwesome: Yeah. Nut this fanbase kicks ass, and I wish people saw that.
http://theadmin.co.uk/ScrSnp/ny9ZAD.png
Technic was great, I play 6.0.7, but the newest update is terrible. Never really played tekkit
Kawaii_icybeauti: Same here.
Kawaii_icybeauti: Normal is just a way of saying that you're boring and not awesome
AJIsAwesome: I think of it as "You obviously love octavia"
just to show much much i mines out
Dat Vivix
AJIsAwesome: You Obviously Love Octavia.
Chrysalis: Why does it look like it's in HD
mined*
Kawaii_icybeauti: we're all a little insane :D
Kawaii_icybeauti: Emil :D Nice!
killerpony7733 16x faithful texture pack
MadSurge: It's like all the misfits teamed up. I love that.
And the thing about life is that we're just one in 7 billion.
We're not important.
I can't do computer art like this but I can draw awesomelyness
i have the draw distance on so low or the server lags HORRIBLY cause of how much i have running
We have 2 goals in life.
Survival and reproduction.
That's it.
Drawing isn't my cutie mark. My friend is an awesome artist though.
LOL
Kawaii_icybeauti: but we're almost all good misfits :3
is there an equestria minecraft multiplayer surver
Emil: But we're growing every day, so that's a plus.
Thunder-Crescent: think so.
emil there is a 3rd,
Ponies
AJIsAwesome: Still, we're not important.
I can draw an awesome Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash :D
Emil: Who says?
Chrysalis: True true.
MadSurge: Yeah, like my mom said when she brought me to broyncon, there will always be the creeps, but they're everywhere. She said that most of the peopel she saw looked nice and shy.
We're too many to all be important
but that makes life worth living
We're important to eachother
You know, you have more chances to get autism than to get famous.
Vivix: True words
Vivix: Excactly. Only way to be important is to be colsely related to someone.
screw quarrys, THIS is a resource collector http://theadmin.co.uk/ScrSnp/0vo9GZ.png
Vivix: So true.
*closely
Kawaii_icybeauti: all fandoms have creeps and jerks, that can't be helped. We have little of those luckily :$
MadSurge: I am tired of that excuse.
We do have the fastest growing porn archive at r34 though
MadSurge: But it's ture.
*true
You know, I don't care if other people don't like the show, just don't criticize me for liking it
Pinkie_Brony: Same here.
Pinkie_Brony: That ain't gonna work.
MadSurge: Yeah. I did mention to my mom there are creeps in the catholic church (My family is catholic) so she kind of just went with it.
/me slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
;__;
that poor trout
lol
Emil: You're right, it won't, but I wish it would
/me hugs Jmo like an abused wife
/me sends the trout for councelling
D'awwwwww
Hi everypony
Pinkie_Brony: Self pity doesn't help. And prayer neither.
/me glomps Vivix
Heya CrazyHippie1234

Pinkie_Brony: Action does, however. ;)
Hi Kawaii_icybeauti
CrazyHippie1234*
tab fail
hi Chrysalis
howdy and do you know the ame of the equuestria surver or no
Emil: Just violent acts
I LOVE this fandom, even if it has its ups and downs. I'm glad to be a strong supporter of this AMAZING community.
Man tab is a girl's best friend in here.
Whose streaming?
Hiya Chrysalis!!
lolwut.
CrazyHippie1234: Hello!
ohai CrazyCherry anyway!
Hi AJIsAwesome
CrazyHippie1234: Wrek
Emil: I know, I'm not saying we should ignore the creeps. I'm just saying it's inevitable and we should deal with it
CrazyHippie1234: Hi :)
Pinkie_Brony: Violent ones are the most easy ones.
oh wow
MadSurge: Yeah.
Well hi Pinkie_Brony
Wreky is best artist.
that eye was DAMN creepy
Pinkie_Brony: You want emotions. Fellings.
*Feelings.
I loved draeing hazel eyes in art class.
CrazyHippie1234: welcome to the herd ^_^
emil http://i128.photobucket.com/albums/p192/kitty_anime_luvr/Tumblr%20GIFs%20and%20Pics/tumblr_m41hitGu6P1qe4w2s.gif
Emil: Yes
Pinkie_Brony: Only way to make people care.
Pinkie_Brony: What do you mean? Ive been with the herd for awhile now
I like the eyes\
CrazyHippie1234:Oh sorry, didn't know.. I'm new XD
I like the eyes. Brings a serious tone.
wow, I'm 14 mintues away from finishing the master of puppets album.
Welcome to the herd Pinkie_Brony
Indubatubly CrazyHippie1234

AJIsAwesome: /)(\!
Emil: Goodbye
He was a good Emil
?
Bye
Bye.
Be brave
CrazyHippie1234: /)
Pinkie_Brony: (\
It's funny how fussing on such a small detail like white in a eye and added color can bring it to life.
CrazyHippie1234: Goodbye
Gotta love rammstein except this is one of their songs done by someone else
CrazyHippie1234: /)(\
Bye MLP_Brovakiin
The music I'm listening to is SO different from the music Wrek is playing O_o
Wrek: is this rammstein remix or something?
Bai MLP_Brovakiin
and so they went and made a rammstein cover. and they didnt fail
lowfn|Minecraft: whatchu listening to?
Wrek: cover by sabaton
lowfn|Minecraft: I was saying goodbye to someone else :P
Oh it is rammsteing
Wrek: whoops, wrong ping
rammstein*
Vivix: The Gypsy Bard (Extended Edition)
Gypsy bard is a good song
:O
lowfn|Minecraft: Ooh, I like her voice. Didn't really sound like pinkie, but amazing singing voice
In fact- I don't know if she's supposed to sound like Pinkie-
Jenny does have a good singing voive.
I also like lyrics-
they are closed for unnoficial streams
but for events such as new eps
theyre used for crowd control
Vivix: When your loved ones have been mangled!
Pinkie_Brony: When they strat streaming the new episodes, the rooms will come out liek that.
Aah Yeaah
In fact, I'll go listen to it now
Vivix: /)
heylo there
(\

survivor: Haha it's not technically videos /)
yay!
When are the new episodes airing for MLP, does anyone know?
We aren't allowed to link profiles either, during stream
this fall
*anypony
Pinkie_Brony: There still isn't a release date.
anyone and anypony are interchangable, for ponies anybody and anypony are different
Kawaii_icybeauti: But they're making them?
Oh yeah, here comes the mane....
BTW, no plans for Movie Night?
Pinkie_Brony: Oh yeah, they're more or less done. Rumour is September, but it could be Sep-Dec
Pinkie_Brony: Of course! But this season only has 13 episodes due to some legal stuff the company had. It's no biggie though.
Ooh, that was the reason? Wil just said "certain" or something- many thought it was hint at movie
Kawaii_icybeauti really?
Kawaii_icybeauti: Sounds good to me (:
Kawaii_icybeauti: They will be 30mins long instead of 22 though
Just so long as it starts ebfore competition season.
Vivix: Yes!
22:44 is animation standard, with ads thats 30 minutes
I'm on my third runthrough for season 1 and 2
so I think they'll still be 22:44
MLP_Brovakiin: Wait, adding comercials or not?
Of COURSE! I leave to help my father with something and miss the EYE!!! :'(
Kawaii_icybeauti: No adds I think
/me flips his desk
MLP_Brovakiin: Oh cool
but that would be breaking all standards of modern TV
I don't think it's 30 minutes minus ads-
If onyl no commercials lol
RaveBrony: O.O
Vivix: They would be 45 mins with ads probably
but that's drama slot-
I always miss the drawing of the eye :'(
where did you hear this?
Hello
YESSSSSSS!!!!MOAR PONY!
everypony*
or actually drama slot is 40 minutes withou ads
Hey there, CCCP :P
:$ RAMMSTEIN!
Hallo CCCP
CCCP: Hello!
thanks for letting me know!
/me huggies RaveBrony MLP_Brovakiin and AJIsAwesome :)
So far, I have to say that this is my favorite MLP related site.
LINKS, LINKS, LINKS ZU DREI FEAR :D
This, then EQD, then my little brony.
Pinkie_Brony: Same here. Same here.:)
Never seen MLB
CCCP: have you calmed down now :P

AJIsAwesome: Yay! (\
Vivix: It's part of the chain of memebase sites.
Hiya CCCP
MLP_Brovakiin what do you mean?
Pinkie_Brony: /)
Hai Vivix *hugs*
Well hello CCCP
Oh, I don't watch meme related things, but yeah-
/me hugs CCCP
EQD is alright I guess, never really got into it.. barely spent anyt time on it
hallo CrazyHippie1234 *huggies*
back guys :d
CCCP: You where a tad bit hyperactive earlier :D
EQD is good for news, but that's all it is, really. It's not a hangout spot
oops
I like EQD over most brony related sites
HI Panda
you know what? screw slime I'll just say my house is done and when i find slime Ill add to it....
MLP_Brovakiin oh :3
Welcome back Panda
05hows that? :D
Vivix: its why I like this site
CrazyHippie1234 :D hiya
Yeah
MLP_Brovakiin :D herro
05i think i finally figured out a way to make twi's straight cut mane look good
Wrek: looking good, and the rammsteint adds nicely.
I think for me it's EQD, FIM/Ponyfic Archive and This in a bundle
though FIM can get on my nerves-
Wrek: SUCCESS!!! /)
Wrek: Are you doing this live or is it recorded? jw
So with that being said: yay I finally finished my first ligit house on minecraft :)
05always live
oh thats what I'll listen to next.
Wrek: Amazing!
Pinkie_Brony: 99% of everything streamed is live,
wait, movies and shows, and youtube
Nice Dovah!
killerpony7733: awesome ha
I'd like to see a color swap and a hidden wizzard hat at the last second to make trixie. Just to see everybody's reaction.
episodes and games, and this, is probably onlie 'live'
Vivix: So in short, 99% of not 100% is live
More lke 40% is live, rest is stream
XylemTube: :D
Vivix: I was talking as far as, When a mod streams it's live. But yes they do live stream things that are recorded in a sense
Wrek gonna take a guess and say, her mane flowing like its in the wind?
Ah yes, I was refering to how- only the games and art are are live, and I don't know how often they're shown by the mods- wrek and phase4 does the most of live I think-
YESH!
brb everypony, got some homework I have to attend to :/
FEUER FREI!
BANG BANG
DOUBLE KILL
ahh now this sounds more like rammstien
wow
Wished out of existance? Almost sounds like DBZ XD

MadSurge: I see.
We must break the roof
05Golakka: hm?

Hallo Eli
Hai Eli
Hey Eli!
Eli: Welcome back!
As you can see Wrek is making another masterpiece
good evening :) thx AJIsAwesome
and yeah MadSurge i see ;)
though she doesn't seem quite happy, that Twily :(
Fucking hell, I put salt in my coffee, make one later
Her horn reminds me of the drills from Gurren Lagann...
Given how tall she in in this pic. I would call her Princess Twilight
Bunny-Striker: why would you put salt in your coffe?
I hate plastic bezels for laptops. <<
Eli: Salt and sugar look the same
Eli: she's having a badass moment though
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m97tufBNDr1res3imo1_1280.gif
lol
MadSurge: lol, from just sehing her head, i thought she would be lying in bed, sulking or something. i didn't see the pose at first :) badass
Major pretty sure that is waht FIM would of looked like if it weren't for Fuast.
http://www.youtube.com/user/TheSHHAS/videos
Barbetos|AtWork: hell TF2 + Ponies - Fuast = Me Approve :D
hi everypony
Quick_Thinker: Hello!
Major: did you see the Pyro's version of Smile Smile Smile? :D
dat twighlight
oh hey
it's minecraft again
MadSurge: nope, but Im sure I dont want to :D
that art is much MUCH MUCH better then i can do :l
Major: It's hilarious, youtube "fire fire fire" :D
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: The Great Cartoon Character Secret Santa / Won't Sompony Think of the Trees / You Haven't Aged A Day
MadSurge: by that title I already regret hearing about it XD
also newsflash on my dilema with my parents about the hoodie they are probely going to allow to keep it ,BUT now another dilema has popped up
Major: it's so happy :D and that's how I play pyro :D
Quick_Thinker: What is it?
moo
well my lifelonf best friend saw the READ A BOOK bag and immeaditly declared me gay, I know what most what say then he's not a very good friend then you should leave ,but the thing is he was my friend from my childhood and we have been friends for a long time i don't know what to do or tell him
let him walk it off
People say stupid things- and he'll probably pull himself together
Quick_Thinker: Try explaining to him. Did he listen to reason?
Quick_Thinker: Show him Cupcakes
Ha'
Hey y'all! How is everypony doing? :)
well he thinks that ponys are gay and i have not been able to get him to watch the show or give it an honest fair shot
No, but honestly. People say rash things when annoyed or confronted, he'll probably ignore it if you just- let him
Quick_Thinker: if he cant exept it then he isnt your friend.
Fisheh_Fish: Hello!
Do not try to make him watch teh show
he'll just get more annoyed with it
Hallo Fisheh_Fish :)
accept
Ohai Fisheh_Fish! Doing good!
*
Quick_Thinker: Just give him time. Don't try to force him to like something he doesn't.
^
^^
Dovah i know that but i have been his friend for my entire life im just trying to make him stop being an ass
^^^
People come around, even if you do something they don't like that you're doing, they usually come around
but hes been hanging around the wrong crowd in high school and i fear i may have lost him
wait, what's all this about books?
Quick_Thinker: Bullet can be pretty persuasive..
did someone wear a pony shirt or something?
Read a book bag
heavy*
Take the guy I work with for example. I got him to like apple bloom a few months back. This morning he told me how he started reading wikis on MLP: FiM, and at lunch he watched the first episode today XD
Nice!
Quick_Thinker: Then try to bring him out of that group. Have a personal conversation with him and tell him that you don't like how he's become.
if it's anything pony related you had it coming
None of my friends watch the show, but none of htem care that I do
if not then i dunno
im going to hit the hay ill be on TF2 tomorrow so ill see you whe i see you bye bronies *brohoofs to everypony ?)
So the trick is get them to like a single pony, and then it just snowballs after that.
Thunder-Crescent: Night!
I'm not in touch with any of my childhood friends-
wtf happend to teh musics!
all moved away and stuff changes
well my other best friend couldn't stand the show but soon he found he liked RD and next thing i know yesterday he sent pony swag pics from hot topic
I think Wrek went offline
hey guys.... if bronyfunds working?
yeah he's not even in chat atm
Goodnight Thunder-Crescent
I`m not going to be here tonight, got go to sleep at 8:30 for football tryouts
Quick_Thinker: Aww, that's nice.
need to wake up early
shameful
even more disgraceful he likes rainbow bitch
bleh time for my own tunes then -_-
But yeah, I'm no good with heart to heart, but that might be the best way if he's falling into the wrong crowd. More so than he not liking that you enjoy the show
Buytoast please stop
no more stream or is that just me?
i'm trying to get commissions to help pay $200 rent... extra goes to $1000 eye surgery. reached so far $30
Buytoast: Don't be a dick, dude.

rammstein
Can't go wrong with Rammstein.
the primary reason some people want to learn german is to understand rammstein
ehh he can't do anything with it anyway no credit card info
their lyrics are surprisingly inteligent most of the time
also it seems that my name is lee tom and i live in begin
and back
the account is limited until y add credit info and other stuff wich i'm not going to do
Wrek: Not more metal, you have already got me hooked on RAUBTIER 6_9
the bad part is that i can't close it until i add that stuff
>.<
so slow
chat is so slow today
<.<
>.>
NEKKID TIME
/me dances about
one question: is Ramstein that famous because the music is good, or because you all think german is funny?
/me joins Bronysith and dances
i blame paypal for not asking email confirmation when singing to their service
/me collapses from lack of oxygen
When we heard rammstein as kids, we were like "German is cool, man"
but- I never listened to rammstein fater that
after*
00,10good song
ooo, du hast
bah, stupid stream lag

13clearly you have never heard blumchen
Blumchen?
Vivix: true. as a kid i thought french is cool :P silly me
O_o?
Hehe

I don't really like any metal anymore
when I was 12 I really liked black metal
Blümchen? what's that Shizuka?
13i will have to queue some up next time i stream

disapointing
Don't worry
There's a welcome song? o.o
CrimsonPhoenix: no vid links on stream :(
"No bun intended" >.<
I got the theme looping in my youtube anyway.
SnowyFluttershy: http://derpiboo.ru/2604
00,10so how many people notived the Twi in that picture before the loaf of bread?
Shizuka: "No bun intended" OH YOU!
Sumica: really?
Hey Shizuka! That bread is gigantic and looks delicious >Q
Sumica, actually I noticed the business card before the bread than the note
Haha thanks AJ. I've only been apart of it for a week...
*:Q
explains where Shizuka's been all day :)
I completely missed Twilight
SnowyFluttershy: Well then, welcome to the herd! :D
^
SnowyFluttershy: No problem. I hope you have a great time here!:)
you're so lucky snowy. you have a whole new season to look forward to
with none of the anguish of waiting
HELLO!
IM back
Haio Golakka
hai Golakka
for now, also GilDash|Gaming is a slaaaaaaaahhhg
What do you mean?
Golakka: Welcome back!
and 18 hours of content to start with
WB Golakka
00,10hey I just noticed, I now have a scroll bar on my games list on steam.
dayum now that I started paying attention to all the new bronies here... i think we may make the 300 mark
because season 3 is (hopefully) starting soon. some of us have been here fromt he beginning
Sumica, really?
I've already watched the first two series twice each.
SnowyFluttershy: enjoy our mod Wrek's art and chat with us about what you like! :)
Nice dude
SnowyFluttershy: There's a season 3 coming soon.:)
MadSurge, I liek ponies
do u?
Sumica: how many games do u have?
Yeah, i've been listening to the music.
dat ping
13only now you do?
http://i.imgur.com/1LmS9.jpg
CrimsonPhoenix: Like? I don't like them, I LOVE them!
00,1049 and yes Shizuka
MadSurge, I like chocolate milk
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Wallpaper Compilation #63
Golakka: Be careful what you post, dude.:S
really Golakka?
Thats absentia :D
every time I see the eqd update I hope for a moment its going to be something like "SEASON 3 BEGINS X DATE"
CrimsonPhoenix: shush, you're lactose intolerant! :D
what did he say?
and then have my hopes dashed.
BTW Ello Everypony!
Shizuka: the Pyro's version of Smile Smile Smile is hilarious! :D
Haio Dj_Cyber-4G
Hey Dj_Cyber-4G
00,10my guss is 2weeks 2 days.
ohai Dj_Cyber-4G
Dj_Cyber-4G: Hello!
2 weeks until announced start?
when was season 2 announced?
dammit stream died
otakon: It did naaaaht.
00,10mind you I am just going by hub having showen all of s1 and 2 on the weekends
TheMaster: Oh it's funny EQD were that stupid to believe a rumor, And then said sorry for saying it was highly likely
13no comments on bread .-.
00,10they have showen all the eps in order
13just one fav..
Sumica: really? i havnt noticed that...
so...in 2 weeks you think season 3 will become real?
What bread? :o
So what's this ''Friday movie night''?
without even a announcment to get hyped?
00,10not counting this weekend due to event they last 2 eps will be next weekend
SnowyFluttershy: We watch movies :D
killerpony7733: Well, everyone makes mistakes. It's a fact of life.
Ello again sumica i was in the mass effect stream you did a while ago
This -> makes more sense than it should http://derpy.me/3qWSL
SnowyFluttershy: watch movies and 2 MLP ep
I guess it makes sense that the target audience isn't internet savvy to -get- hyped.
I must verify what Sumica says
I mean what sort of movie's?
00,10hello Dj_Cyber-4G
Just random or what?
Random
but by now you think they'd give a tweet or something.
Lolwut
SnowyFluttershy: random
They will give sound when they can
Business is business
AJIsAwesome: Eeeeh, As a brony news site. You need to have evidence backing the news if it's very important. But in that case it was purely stupid of them
S1 of simpsons was delayed 3 months 3 weeks or so before premiere?
SnowyFluttershy: There is a lottery they announce when they pool all of our suggested movies/episodes and choose a select few.
00,10then again I still belive we will have another 13 eps anounced by november so take what I say worth a grain of salt
lol
killerpony7733: it's not like they're gettin payd...
Hehe
Ah ok
I want to believe Sumica
SnowyFluttershy: unfortunately they had problems with it lately
killerpony7733: It's still a mistake, though. Nothing to get hung up about.
my heart won't be able to take breaks for too long though.
I didn't even see said mistake
like that 2 week wait inbetween eps 2 and 3 for season 3
or was it a whole month
To be honest, i'm still quite new to this whole thing, although I want to get more involved, so anyting you could share with me about MLP would be appreciated ^^
season 2*
AJIsAwesome: Eh i just think it was silly of them. Cause many people were getting so hyped and some are still fooled by the rumor due to it
Ill speak to you lot tomorrow!
Seeya Golakka
killerpony7733: Remeber one of the PR's for Care Bears sent that strange email talking about the show?
00,10funfact eqd dose make money
I just found the ginyu force full theme song, my life is complete
killerpony7733: it was silly of them, but- they were probably so hyped they wanted to believe it? Either way
Seth must be pretty happy then.
what is eqd making money on?
Goodbye Golakka
Golakka: Bye!
Ads
bye Golakka
Bye Golakka
Cya
love this song
their are 2 things i like but shouldn't pokemon [GAMES NOT ANIME] and a bit of star wars [the OLDER star wars games ]
00,10on things they dont even own TheMaster
SnowyFluttershy: Do you know the basic IRC commands?
Goodbye SnowyFluttershy
Vivix: Still they ARE a news site for anything MLP FIM related and something as big as when the season starts has to be fact
Gah... I see wrek doing it, but can't determine what tools he's using -.-
IRC Commands?
killerpony7733: totally agree with you, they probably totally lapsed on it and made a bad decision. Not really--any doubt that they shouldn't have though
what i'm seeing thats interesting is that at this rate of creativity the fandom may just start producing its own animated, and voice acted episodes on its own.
[In other words, no]
EqD has posted false rumors and outright incorrect reports in the past, multiple times
I don't watch much fanmade content, so fanmade sodes--I probably would not watch
also true
SnowyFluttershy: There's an action command that you can do by typing "/me" infront of what you want to type
Not even the Picture Perfect music video?
TheMaster: since the "movie" of photo finish song, i believe it
SnowyFluttershy: if you want to change nick without exiting the chat or use a third person for yourself :D
Picture Perfect Pony*
CountDoofus: I don't know that one, is that the luna one?
/me Test
No, it's finished?
hi all
And to quickly say someone's name, partially type out their name, and hit "Tab"
Hallo Bigjack
There ya go SnowyFluttershy :)
Fisheh_Fish: Test
SnowyFluttershy: perfect!
hai Bigjack
Nah, it's a song with Photo Finish. If you didn't know it was fanmade, you'd SWEAR it's a season 3 leak.
Bigjack: Hello!
Heya Bigjack
horry shit what sumica saz is true!
Hey
nice picture ^^
Haio Bigjack
so does anyone else remember a year or so ago when the drawfriends started, and they said that they'd only post canon ponies and nothing sexual?
SnowyFluttershy: When you partially type out the name, and hit "Tab", it makes a Ping noise
CountDoofus: TBH, I could already tell it was a fanmade music video by the beginning.
CountDoofus: ah nice, but yeah- I tend to stay away from fananimation- I get a bit starstruck and jealous, ha. But, fanmade episodes would make me cringe with eh fanon vs canon issues-- but..you never know
00,10well the observation is trew Dovah
kirzstryfe: What's wrong?
Ah ok
Oh yeah, No OC's and child friendly
So it sort of let's them know your asking them a qustion
Sumica: I didnt belive u so I had to check....
what a program do you use?
it has skidded out of that, but all their vaginas have been accidental
Yeah, pretty much
SnowyFluttershy: another thing is that links are allowed, but video links are forbidden during streams and all links are forbidden during movie night
otakon: so pyromancer is a good starter class in dark souls?
Vivix: What?:S
YES
Got it
My latest comic had like 13 OCs, and EqD accepted that in a comic post.
I've told you before YES
also, i'm out for now
gotta mow the grass
/me will be right back.
bbl guys!
AJIsAwesome: Whenver EqD has accidentally posted something mature
Seeya, otakon
otakon: gnight otakon
not sleeping
See ya later otakon
"accidentally" my ass :P
bye otakon
o ahh he gone
Ich will!
<3
I don't think they look at most of the images
or music
only fanfiction
Goodbye otakon
SnowyFluttershy: also, request ponies to mods at your own risk :D you may not get Friendship is Magic!
Can everyone calm down about EQ Daily? It was a mistake, and it's in the past.
which is interesting. since most of the fanfiction is pretty bad anyway
00,10It's ok Dovah, I would not belive me either
lol
Hehhe
the game dark souls its on pc too?
it will be soon
or it is
An AJIsAwesome I'm not mad at EQD or anything, I like them, just making smalltalk
Bigjack: it's coming out in a few days
i know its already out on pirate bay and what not
Vivix: Okay, just didn't want things to escalate.
someone leaked it
MadSurge: What do you mean?
and they're apparently cracking it in various ways
cool
MadSurge: cool ;D
im not suprised darksouls is alreayud out on TPB
I wonder how many more viewers we'll have at season 3 start compared to season 2 start
the fiels are available from steam
00,10dat machinima
all you gotta do is to crack the laucnehr and voila
you'd think anyone on the internet would have already heard about my little pony by now
TheMaster: Everyone has their own opinion. Some people may like it, some people won't. It's a fact of life.
Guild Wars 2 soon! Who's playing?
Wrek: wait what? it wont unlock for another 10 hours...
SnowyFluttershy: I mean that the mods will stream whatever they like, and if you request ponies to be streamed you might get the older series instead :D
damn i can only see as far as when the last round up is on btw Sumica it appears that lunar eclipse wont be on unless i missed it somehow.
what do you think about darksider 2?
What wa the viewcount on S2 premier? I remember at end of season it was around.. 3000? wow my memory is crap
less than a week CountDoofus :)
Haha ok ^^
it was crazy high
i would play guild wars 2 but its not free to play ;_;
00,10that was some time ago. Dovah
chat is pretty much unreadable even in the individual groups
it is free to play, you just have to buy the game
ie. the last round up start
SnowyFluttershy: so where are you from? :)
Yeah, I never chat during saturday ponies, soo much chat
Bigjack: i played it and its awesome
/me wishes S3 would be announced already
I live in Northern Ireland
though, oh man. that chat speed when derpy first appeared.
like a tidal wave
Nittany_Discord: everybrony wish
Nittany_Discord: Hello, Nittany_Discord!
Nittany_Discord: yeah .__. also HIIII
The_Browncoat: Oooh yeah, that was an EXPLOSION
Michael: Well i saw it and its awesome but i dont like to pay months xd
SnowyFluttershy: What's it like there? I've never been outside of the states
also hai Nittany_Discord
Nittany_Discord: you along with everyone else in the herd.
Hallo Nittany_Discord :)
you only pay the game Bigjack
kirzstryfe: I'm really gonna luck out with that game. My friends wanna play it, some of my co-workers gonna play it, and Bronystaters gonna play. Plus I just started a massive drawing project. Combine that with work... *bursts into tears*
/me glomps Nittany_Discord and puts him in a maid corset
/me is overwhelmed by love <3
Hi everyone.
The weather isn't great, but the countryside is beutifull and there's allot of thing's to sightsee
Dark souls isn't a mmo
Haio Nittany_Discord
Michael: well i read and they said no free to play gw 2
Sumica: dont u dare use your fancy mathmatics on me!
DARK SOULS IS GOING TO MURDER ME AND I WILL LOVE IT
THIS SONG! :'(
/me takes maid corset off for a while
kirzstryfe: wait are you getting dark souls?
Bigjack: it's free, believe me
Bigjack, you have to buy the game itself, but there's no monthly fee
00,102+2+2+2+2+
Nittany why are you in a maid outfit?
hmmm k
SnowyFluttershy: :) lots of pretty landscape and countryside I bet
when is prepare to die comeing out anyway? isnt it tomarrow?
Are we allowed to post youtube link's?
Because Bronysith likes to put me in maid outfits
SnowyFluttershy: only if the stream is off
SnowyFluttershy: Not during a stream, no.
oh okay. makes sense
duuno i just read it about guild wars 2 and they wroten ot free to play but if oyu said its free then k ;D
Since I tend to act like a maid sometimes.
./)
WHAT A GUN!
ok i'll wait then. And yes, MadSurge , there is some very nice landscape.
AHHHHHHHHHH
3 levels of mmo: free-to-play (cash shop driven, buy once w/no monthly fee, and buy game + monthly fee
cool weapon :p
dark souls was supposed to unlock in 4 hours
00,10new bond movie Dovah?
Nittany_Discord: I got JUST the fanfic for you. Starring Trixie as a maid.
now it is 10 hours, ughhhhhh
kirzstryfe don't forget pay to win
SnowyFluttershy: image links are fine though, as long as it's nothing nasty :D
Pass if it's clop.
k ^^
so twilight hold iwth hoofs or magic ;D?
with magic of course
those aren't games imo :P
Sumica: say what now? I mean DaS: prepare to die edition
Nittany_Discord: want some suggestive pics?
00,10ah
Nittany_Discord: are you insinuating that your behavior mimics that of the female gender currently employed in the cleaning service?
00,10sounded liek the title of a bond movie
what do you think about DARKSIDER 2?
DoctoDoctorWho: Yes.
Nittany_Discord: Well, it HAS clop scenes, but the author marks them as such and provides a non-clop version of those chapters.
/me facehoofs at DoctoDoctorWho's qustion
Pass
Bigjack: I'm curious if they'll ever do a game with Pestilence or Famine :D
x.x
Nittany_Discord: Good man :D
That fanfic was okay- but I got kindof bored of it-
better than expected
Trixie wasn't mean enough
brb
I'm curious. Why is she a maid?
well i play now Divinity 2 as Warrior xd
MadSurge: The second is about Death, but the third game is actually going to be multiplayer with all 4 available
Nittany_Discord: Twilight thinks it will help her release her good side
Nittany_Discord: you dont want any suggestive pics? okay then
Not really Bronysith.
Nittany_Discord: mmmk
SnowyFluttershy: aha, a game nerd! Welcome aboard :$
Vivix: "Of Maids and Mistresses", right?
Yay <3
Yeah, that's the one CountDoofus
wish me luck I'm going to try to get my xlive working..
back
It's good, but I felt it was a bit- average in quality at times
SnowyFluttershy: I assume you like 'Shy the most, yes?
It didn't get me, really, as a shipfic
ok i go now bye all bro hoofs all (\^^/)
Yup yup
Later Bigjack
Bye Bigjack!
Night all
or what do you say sumica?
bye Bigjack (\
Bigjack: Bye! /)
Cya Bigjack
Goodbye Bigjack
Shizuka: that bread looks delicious
00,10yeah I prefer that over the bazzar bargen that she always seems to be using in the videos
Nittany_Discord: in that fic, Twilight realizes Trixie is surpressing bad foalhood memories by forcing herself into the role of a showmare. In an attempt to break her out of it, she forces Trixie into another role; that of a maid. Only, it only makes things worse... And Twilight doesn't realize is, until it's almost too late.
(sorry for wall o' text)
it*
Oh, I was only half way through it, didn't know she got worse-
CountDoofus: u made the fanfic?
... Woops.
No problem ^^
Nah, sadly. Wish I had that much talent :)
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck damn that Gigabit and his supposed fucking up my xlive!
Maybe I'll pick it up again, reading Twilight Effect atm
oh well
gona finish my stream
It was written by the same author who wrote "Cheerilee's Garden", though. I LOVED that fic.
Dovah: :S
thx Wrek for the stream
And let me guess, there's Twixie clop in it?
CountDoofus: Reaaally? I never read that, but he sounded like a great guy
How do I know who the mod's are?
SnowyFluttershy: They have the @ symbol.
Nittany_Discord: Oh yeah. Applejack and Rainbow get a slice too.
the @ by their names
but I didn't like of maids very much, I thought was a bit eh..hard to feel
wasn't cheerilees garden that fic with all the child murder and shit?
Ah ok
and that we use colors
00,10the ones with @ or % infrom of there name
mine isnt working today s'all
Buytoast: yeah, he wrote it to creep himself out
Buytoast: Yep.
SnowyFluttershy: also only they can use colored text
You all scare me away from fics i swear :D
Not only that, the guy's Belgian. Like me. We're all a little messed up in the head :D
Child torture and murder.
Fics are great, I don't read gore
but*
Is it on the same f***ed up level as cupcakes and related?
ah, who am i kidding, i dont have time for reading!! Haha :D
Not something you want to read unless you don't mind something grimdark like that.
Who likes pie?
I've read 8.5 million words at the moment-
i liek pie
CUPCAKES
And then there's a sequel, but the Mane 6 die in it.
Ill read a paragraph and forget about whatever im reading :D
new idea instead of blaming gigabit form my broken xlive i balme DoctoDoctorWho!
I never read it, but I read his comments as to why he wrote it- sounded sane enough
A fic I could recommend is "My Roommate is a Vampire". No gore, no clop.
AJIsAwesome: no, let's keep talking about shitty grimdark fanfics :D
I just dont see how people can do it! x_x
:O
i see star trek?
AJIsAwesome: apple pie is the best
E-mail!
Star Trek tiem!
CountDoofus: I was thinking abou reading that, but I'm wary of commedy- and Vinly
How do I make Ponie emoticons?
Michael: you do? i see wrek drawing
Michael: oh, THAR it is
funny
MLP_Brovakiin: That and Lemon Merengue.
SnowyFluttershy: : ) = :)

Goodbye SirGanjalf
MLP_Brovakiin: I still agree, though.
SnowyFluttershy: LOVE HER

SnowyFluttershy: Flutterrage:D
Is this a qpisode?
RED KEY OPENS RED DOOR
SnowyFluttershy: everypony <3 fluttershy
of course
SnowyFluttershy: I love Flutterrage, though.
00,10it's a big battery
SnowyFluttershy: also because she's cute and shy, right?
Sumica: calibrations
I love every aspect of her.
SnowyFluttershy: that's the spirit!
DUN DUN DUN

Cow
Q is best pony
Nittany_Discord: yes
aye it iss Nittany_Discord
I think that her mean scary side wouldn't be anywhere near as awesome if she wasn't nomally so shy.
11,01If so, cool.
Darnit Sumica
00,10^_^
Q episode, yet still DS9... so torn
And yet she's so kind, all she REALLY wanted was to befriend some people.
looks like we're in for a big ol' storm of shi-I mean chaos, :3
Uhh... ponies.
SnowyFluttershy: my favs are 'Shy and Pinkie :D
Rarity, Shy and pinkie here
people said that enterprises intro was a modo kilelr for the quick intro
if thats true
then DS9's msut be a snorefest
SnowyFluttershy: Mine's obvious.:D
mood killer*
i wub all the ponies
Enterprise was jarring because it was suddenly dur all over the place
Wrek: I like this intro
Major*
I got a few more fics I'd recommend, but... You know... option to go beyond PG-13 is there, so I'll keep quiet.
but I liked the Enterprise intro nontheless
...DIng
Gotta be Shy, Angle and Derpy forme.
Wrek: Are you going to change your text color?
CountDoofus: How is My roomate is a vampire, though? I've got tons to read now, but- I was curious about that one
not untill i get back on mIRC
and stop pinging me
Sorry.:$
SnowyFluttershy: who doesn't love Derpy? :P
k kerW no more ping
If you got W 7 you can mute the window with webclient
Haha.
Im getting pings but I see nothing? what is this witchcraft?
Streamer is using webclient, pingnoises galore
I love how they put angle there to compliment Fshy's bad side.
DoctoDoctorWho: you can here wreks pings
DoctoDoctorWho: that's Wre k's pings
so dont ping him
oh, k
exactly
so Q is in TNG and DS9?
"Silver and- Oh wait..."
what's that?
wasnt he in voyager too?
And in Voyager.
atleast one?
yeh
He was in a couple at least.
i still need to watch more TNG
just cant be bothered ATM
12345
Vivix: Well, it's written from Octavia's point of view. She begins to suspect Vinyl is a vampire, later developes a supernatural condition of herself, and at this point, they're at war with some sort of neighborhood watch group dedicated to eradicating the supernatural.
Bronysith: TNG? what's that?
What's the point of an access code if you can scan your eye?!
I seriously hope the Cutie Pie Crusaders finally realise their talent's in season three. It bother's me that none of the older ponie's have realised it yet.
hola everypony
Michael: star trek the next generation
Deadlypon3: someone could cut out that eye?
Double protection layer Deadlypon3.
hai mitamaking
Whaateva
Haio mitamaking
SnowyFluttershy: the older ones know, but they have to find out themselves, and if they do they're out of the show-
hallo mitamaking
DS9 huh, done with Enterprise
CountDoofus: Thanks! It sounds- checkout worthy, a bit highconcept but still, so was after that fateful night
SnowyFluttershy: so as you can see our current streamer wrek likes artsing and Star Trek. Sometimes also Gmod videos and various Steam games
SnowyFluttershy: Well, not in season 3 IMO. It removes the whole point of the CMC. Maybe in the final season.
I once met Robert Picardo. He played the doctor in Star Trek Voyager :)
CountDoofus: oh, I like the doctor! :)
I've never really liked star trek that much haha. I prefer fantasy to futeristic.
[No offense wr3k]
SnowyFluttershy: same :P
What is O'Brian doing on DS9 again?
SnowyFluttershy: this is fantasy and futeristic tho...
scifi vs fantasy nerds, the eternal battle
I mean like olden day's magic and myth's and stuff
Dat ship getting Discord'ed!
shame that Q is only in 1 DS9 episode eh Wrek
aye
Look at that Spacetalk
Vivix: and TNG vs TOS nerds, the eternal battle
SnowyFluttershy: but that isnt futeristic...
That loud ping
It's so dense you can literally SEE IT
I don't remember her on TNG
I've seen at least one fanart of Discord making the cast of TNG into ponies :D
Dovah: I mean I prefer that kind of olden day's fantasy to this futeristic stuff.
00,10damn that bed is tall
MadSurge: I must see this picture
lol
SnowyFluttershy: oh that makes sence.
SnowyFluttershy: LOTR then :)
i heard discord?
Suddenly Q
DAT DIS- I MEAN Q
damn voice
/me did not know this was the Q episode
mitamaking: hold on, I'll search for it
MadSurge: I've only actually seen each movie once
ping?
w r e k damn man your ping is loud
00,10Q is best troll
lol
JOHN DE LANCIE YOU DID NOT AGE WELL
We must stream a playthrough of Star Trek Borg
Am I the only one not listening to what John is saying, but rather listen to Q sounding like Discord?
mitamaking: MadSurge http://derpy.me/VskvC
00,10I have one of the DS9 games
Lol Spectrum_Rush
Sumica: Is it the SNES one?
Spectrum_Rush: Is that Wesley?
Mr. Quuuaaaaakk
00,10PC
Oh.
I played one on the SNES.
Spectrum_Rush: dammit, you beat me to it! :D
Bleh. Trolls.
the ears
Shizuka: MIND BLOWN
Star Trek Borg is awesome, imagine a game where Q controls your playthroughs
of course its the ears
00,10I never finshed it though.

nothing not even any BOO'S damn tough crowd
/me gives Quick_Thinker a "Boo"
fuck
XD
/me is scared and runs away from the boo and looks at the boo and it turns to brick
My bro said that honey mustard and jalepeno vinager would be good ideas. Feedback
Quick_Thinker: http://derpy.me/YItAo
?
yes that boo
im so clever some times :3
Honey mustard? you can just get rugular chips and DIP them in it.
sometimes is the keyword
regular*
also ponies the reason no skype is i have cold so yeah :l
Quick_Thinker: I'll hold onto this "Boo" for now http://derpy.me/7EAaq
Kawaii_icybeauti: Granny Smith?
Petrified_Discord: Oh you.
AHHHHHHHHHHH GET IT AWAY AHHHHHHHHHH *runs off stage*
AJIsAwesome: I saw someone who wrote apple flavored. Mabe I could use the name rainbow dash and then a list of ingredients.
why did no pony like Vinyl Butterscotch it sounds pretty tastey to me
/me pulls Quick_Thinker back on stage
So, apparently the winning name so far for Mountain Dew's newest flavor is "Hitler did nothing wrong". IDWLOTPA
IDWLOTPA?
DA FAQ!
I don't want to live on this planet anymore

Oh yeah, Hitler totally did nothing wrong. You know, besides burning and killing thousands of Jewish people, invading a non hostile country, and almost turning the entire world upside down.:|
where
sometime last week
huh AJ ones
Quick_Thinker: Petrify: to frighten or turn to stone. Your context is silly :/
How could they approve a stupid name like that?:|
Eddmario: Where did you see that?
AJIsAwesome: Internet
you can turn something to stone in FIRE silly :D
Quick_Thinker: You're thinking of a kilm?
maybe

Kawaii_icybeauti: I saw an image online that had the list of the top 10 voted names
Did they do this for lulz? Because to me this isn't really funny.:S

5.5 mb
the bid wasn't as high as I expected
00,02it'll tell you when its done

Well, speaking of cheap knockoffs of Macross...
oh derp
...
CHEAP?
...time to show my mom another episode of Macross II

makes me think of casshern sins/MLP
is that a mech anime?
I've never seen it so I can't say
RUBBER DUCKEH
ofc it is
00,02Malk, so 5.5 down, how much up?

/me demands Gen 3,6 Scootaloo
3.6*
no please no
This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen a channel fight over, *and* it's the most immaturely I've seen people act toward mods. Disgraceful. I wanna be able to use me at will, but I respect the mods. I'm out until y'all settle down on this.
I love Luna

Of course. Is it me or is chat really whiny tonight?
ValtheJean: oh yes the NBCs i forgot

Evening Ponies
IshGirlfriendlesPony: We get it. Cool it with the /me

PaladinDrakkenwolf: Hello!
nice we're watching DBZ abridged
13sigh...
:D
hai PaladinDrakkenwolf
lol
anyone else lagging?
I'm not whiny. I'm complainy.
a bit before
13val should just give me the stream, i will put all the whiners through the atlas shrugged movie
what's wrong Shizuka?
Shizuka: please no, and there is no whining just /me spam
Shizu: doitdoitdoitdoitdoitdoitdoit
13that would teach them right quick about how to behave in a privately-owned community
xD
dat realization
Shizuka: You. Are. Evil. Good Job!
oh god
I have no idea what Atlas Shrugged is.
XD
dis gun be gud
HA
O_O
That sounds like paradise
13(to be fair the movie is bad but not appallingly so, compare it to the later harry potter movies, just have a lot to fit in)
Meanwhile: ever play bioshock? It's what that is based off of
Really? That sounds cool.
I liked Bioshock.,
00,10ah yes Home For Infinate loosers
Shizuka: Babes in Toyland
Unnr: first off, we're talking about the movie. Second off, watch it. Some people actually like Ayn Rand
XD
Lol
I've never heard of or seen it either.
Meanwhile: The book is also painfully long
lol
Guys your whining that your not whining ......(flawless logic)
fecking lag
13bioshock is as based of ayn rand as harry potter is based off lord of the rings
HELL > HFIL
A movie that's Bioshock-esque only sounds like a good thing.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_Shrugged
ValtheJean: I don't mind ayn rand, but she literally wrote most of her works on the toilet
11,01Wow. Can't believe how much a sleep med killed my anxiety.
same with Martin Luther
It doesn't seem that bad.
I heard there was a case of posterior punishment about 5 minutes ago
Nitt so you're feeling better?
Shizuka: I guess 'Influenced' is a better term
11,01For now.
I'll take whatever youre taking Nittany
11,01I've had trouble sleeping lately because my mind races so much at night, it keeps me up.
ValtheJean: i have not had my daily dose, could you pm me the gen 3.5 scootaloo video? :3
eh?
3.6
get it right
How do you function?
oh, the whining
3.5 was good
I remember when my mind raced every night.
was this seriously over RP?
lol
okay, 3.6 :3
:D
Shizuka: Can you show this Atlas Shrugged thing at some point please?
ValtheJean: WAT
lol
IT NEVER ENDS >_<
at least he doesn't drown ponies
13i've been pondering it hard
13eeeeyup
otakon he never said he didn't
Shizuka: have you been at your thoughtful spot?
11,01It's funny. I thought I was done with anxiety in June. Then I get severe anxiety a few weeks later.
Of course it doesn't. Stupid never ends.
it was more the 2 people being stupid, but they were using a lot of /me spam
Ayn Rand has some interesting points, even if she ultimatly was betrayed by the very tennants of Objectivism that she espoused.
I see #bronystate hasn't changed too much since I've been absent.
You've been absent?
13xkcd gets it right, you're with rand 90% of the way, up until she settles on "therefore be a jerk to everyone"
00,02your welcome
Meanwhile: From #bronystate, yeah.
:D
Not skype though.
13you can be self-serving and not a jerk
Nittany_Discord: Dibs on your leftover meds, I cannot sleep for shit lately
You're on Skype?
Shizuka, that about sums it up
O U
11,01Mom thinks I don't need anxiety meds.
GENERAL MOUNTAIN!
I COMMAND YOU TO STREAM Bronies React to: Season 2 Finale
But can you block

YourLittleDashie: you make NO commands

YOU. DO. NOT. COMMAND. ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING
11,01And I can't really afford them.
do not command ponies

The problem is that through rational egoism, she tended to forget part of her own tenants in her philosophy, the whole not "sacrificing yourself to others *AND* not sacrificing others to yourself"

yeah really
Puky!
we all have master degrees
wait... only the blue part was supposed to be weighted
so long
XD
13looking at bioshock i get the sense that galt's gulch wouldn't scale at all... it only worked because everyone there shared the same ideals, and galt put them through hell to be certain they did
11,01I actually do have a master's degree.
In what Nittany?
in what? may i ask
so longa frieza
11,01Meteorology.
HA
fecking lag
LOL
11,01I should post my master's thesis as proof.
Nittany_Discord are you a weather man?
11,01I wish.
Meteorology is awesome.
11,01Job market and my lack of cash is keeping me from a weather job.
Dat status report.
I wanted to be one for the storms.
Giant Rocks in space awesome
Naked Vegeta incoming
farr aalllgaaa res in peace
11,01And the fact that I don't have a bachelors in meterology.
I have one more semester before I get my Associates Degree in Graphic Design and Interactive Media
11,01*meteorology
hai everyone ^_^
XD
11,01Just Physics.
XD
Hallo OneTrickPony
OneTrickPony: Hello!
XD
That is the problem with rapture, it relied too heavily on everyone sharing a same ideological stance, the very degredation and lack of regard for the survival of the colony shows what happens as core values change over time, but not consistantly through the population
:D
lol wut
LOL
kik
Nittany_Discord I wanted to major in Archeology but the market and and you dodnt get paid enough
major lag
I love this series
11,01I have powerful degrees. There's just little out there for startup meterologists or physicists.
Nitt have you looked at any schools that have your field in it in this accursed state of ours? I think USC has one....? Or Clemson...? I forgot.
Kaio what?
Nittany_Discord heard of overqualifed?
13innit a wonderful economy?
11,01I got my physics degree at Clemson.
11,01Shizuka: Yep.
XD
welp, that's all for today everyone

Shizuka: could we possibly get another Rifftrax movie?
PillowPoni, ValtheJean just finished.

woot
remember my sister having some of those toys
Kandarihu I'm on my phone and my lappies are ded
11,01My fault for being lazy and not seeking work while writing my thesis.
Nittany_Discord its fairly common now my uncle has 3 masters and cant get job so he is going back to college
11,01Malk: I might do the same.
I was watching Rpattz' interview on the daily show.
lol
PillowPoni, okay. I thought Val stopped, but he's streaming other stuff.

Its princess starla/gunivere and the jewel riders

Nittany_Discord but at the same time hes becoming a cop
it was an awesome show
11,01I do love computer programming.
but uncle Val, they're so shiny
Nittany_Discord - IT is never a bad degree with the way technology is going
caramel....
11,01And my mom's friend make a truckload of money doing and IT job from home right now.
PillowPoni, the stream is really down now.
sometime si ahte you.....
Nitt, why not go in for computer programming?
hate*
11,02Mooooo ^-^
Brb guys.
11,01PillowPoni: Maybe I should.
11,01If the market's good.
hiya SuperBrony64 what's up man?
dat silly filly SuperBrony64
Nittany_Discord I pretty much know what I want to do Ill be the guy that maintains internet and local phone lines and I shall be paid well
Because there is a larger % of people with a programming degree (SE, CS, ect) then with the IT degree
Hallo SuperBrony64
11,01I learned computer languages on my own. I always wanted to take formal classes in college and grad school.
11,01I wanted a doctorate in meteorology.
Nittany_Discord - Cobol would definitely be a language to pick up. all the old programmers who know Cobol are reaching retirement age and they'll need replaced
i got an internship based on the fact i knew Cobol and damn near got a job based on it as well
11,01But due to untreated disabilities and a medical problem I had in 2008 - 2009, I might not be able to get one.
I am kindof glad I am taking an engineering degree, that area is so broad
I jsut saw the new webkinz list...One of the dogs looks oike a stoner.
MirrorImage: I have two words for you... Cobol .NEt
11,01My advisors didn't seem confident that I could.
Unnr - 1 word. Mainframe.
MirrorImage: scarier: VAX
11,01They wanted to push me towards getting a masters followed by a job.
Nittany_Discord you collect disabilities?
11,01Or career.
banks aren't going to be upgrading their stuff to Windows just because it's new - they're going to milk their ancient equipment for all its worth
Nittany_Discord: I was reading an article in the new SI about penn state. When I saw the word nittany, I thougt of this place.
13i would rifftrax
13but sb is going now
13and would finish too late for me to start
Damnit.
11,01Kawaii_icybeauti: I'm a Penn State graduate.
I was only still awake for Azkaban.
SuperBrony64: Aaaa Ohia
11,01It's why I have Nittany in my name.
speaking of rifftrax, what's the movies for tomorrow?
Shizuka: oh okay
11,01I formed my nick Nittany Tiger when I was accepted to Penn State in 2007.
Nittany_Discord: Yeah, I remember you tellign us how your name came to be.
Nittany_Discord - please tell me if you have a kid you'll reserve the nickname Nittany_Liger for him/her
Meanwhile: wat now?
Spectrum_Rush: Azkaban Rifftrax would be on but apparently timing.
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
MirrorImage: Dat Napoleon Dynamite reference.
11,01MirrorImage: If I ever have a kid.
Kawaii_icybeauti - ...what?
Why no est Tom
MirrorImage: Remember the liger part?
/me is dissapearing for a bit. Thanks for the chat Shizuka. (Its fun havind random discussions on philosophy and liteary analysis)
I dont want kids, then i have to pay for them
never watched napoleon dynamite
/me ducks and covers
11,01If I ever have money, I want to travel to Latvia so I can ask this amazing girl I met online out.
11,01And then move there if we decide to get married.
Superbrony64 don't leave
Well, as long as that's the case I'm gonna go get some sleep.
My parents met through the peace corps. Try that.
Night everyone.
Nittany_Discord, not sure if you've seen this before but http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7GT7n09zpo
11,01As long a Latvia isn't crappier than the US.
Meanwhile: oh because is sgetting real late for you is wat you mean?
0,14later Meanwhile
Meanwhile: dream of ponies
nite Meanwhile
Meanwhile: Night!
Goodnight Meanwhile
Spectrum_Rush: Actually it's too late to show Azkaban, but yeah it's 4:30 AM.
I think I should join the red cross easiest job on earth
11,01Kandarihu: I have.
11,01It's awesome.
Meanwhile: go sleep ya crazy brit
night Me... fuck
missed him
11,01Someone posted it in a Linked In group.
theres always skype though
Meanwhile http://derpibooru.org/75658?scope=scpe3125a2fdbbd5d9f1698be5f970a7a7aef2641afa
Kandarihu: :D
I almost posted a link to it that spoils what's awesome about it and the top suggested video at the end shows a victim of a cannibal attack. Not a pleasant sight.
4am has been my adverage bedtime for the past month and school starts in a week, I blame bronystate!
MLP_Brovakiin - blame well assigned and accepted
MLP_Brovakiin: Ikr. I'm going to miss getting up at 1pm everyday :(
Godzilla Wednesday :D
I blame my lack of sleep on my part-time job,
11,01So, if I go back to school, I'll do one of three things: Enter a Ph.D. program, go for a bachelors in IT or computer programming, or get certified as a teacher.
teacher certified is the backup plan for me
Kawaii_icybeauti: Haha so true I am screwed on a schoolday I wake up at 6:30am
11,01I'll just need to seek an internship before I graduate.
Nittany_Discord: go for bachelores in computer programming!
MLP_Brovakiin: Ikr. They should start school at least at like 10am. I'd be better off with that.
11,01But it depends on how much I can do during school.
Nittany_Discord - you're in central pennsylvania? definitely look at an intern with Sheetz if you can
Nittany_Discord those feilds will be hard to get a job with
great company, and not just saying that because i work for them
11,01No. I had to move in with my grandmother back in PA.
11,01I did apply to a Sheetz store before I left, but they never even called me back.
Trust me, it's going to go from 105 people on a weekday to like 40 something.
i don't mean a store, i mean something like the corporate offices
11,01And I had to take one of those fucking assessment test for them.
Kawaii_icybeauti: I qould be fine to drop lunch time and wake up an hour later :D
*Would
Im telling you Telecomunications is where the mony is
11,02So, does anypony want to watch me make my dungeon in Minecraft? o.o
MLP_Brovakiin: I want to get a free when I'm a senior in high school so I can wake up later.
yes
SuperBrony64: Sure!
SuperBrony64 - kinky dungeon or deathly dungeon?
SuperBrony64: sure, why not? :P
SuperBrony64: sure.
sure
11,02Deathly dungeon o-o
Kawaii_icybeauti: same here
SuperBrony64: I want to watch you give me slime in minecraft...
11,01I hate employment assessment test. I can pretty much forget about working at that job when I see one.
11,01*tests
SuperBrony64: aw, I was gonna ask if I could rent it if it was kinky, oh well, I guess you dont want 500 bits.... :D
Balls to it goodnight everyone :)
MLP_Brovakiin: Hey, you should check this little reading section out. http://www.thewaronkids.com/student.pdf
night MLP_Brovakiin
MLP_Brovakiin: Night! Sleep well.
MLP_Brovakiin: Remember to sing the sleep song!
Nittany_Discord - Sheetz doesn't give those tests to be a deciding factor. It's more something that they do so supervisors have a personality idea for you
11,01MirrorImage: Whatever. They pretty much determine if you're going to be a model employee or not.
if that were the case, i would have never gotten in
^
what does an assessment test assess?
11,01And since I'm an introvert, I can fucking forget about being considered when they want outgoing people.
All this job talk is making me think that I'm a year away from legally being able to hold a job o.O
so don't apply for an "outgoing people" position?
IT isn't about human interaction
it's more about keeping the bits a flowing
11,01I'm 29. I'm supposed to have a job though I've been in grad school. False expectations have helped cause me to be so anxious and depressed all of the time.
All this job talk makes me a little depressed.
11,01PillowPoni: I'll stop.
time to hit the hay for me, bye http://derpibooru.org/75658?scope=scpe3125a2fdbbd5d9f1698be5f970a7a7aef2641afa
You know one line of work that is desperately needed nowadays? Farmers.
I hope the economy bounds back before I have to start my job hunt.
11,01I hope so too.
Kandarihu: We can work on an apple farm!
Is the stream down?
night thelonepony
Nitt, its not you. Its just in general. I can't seem to get a job yet when I go to a store they havve different. Employees almost every single time.
11,01I really hope the economy improves.
Apples, certainly. But everything else.
11,02Refresh embed :)
Minecraft
It won't improve as long as Obama is in office.
Superbrony64 y u no check
Kandarihu - lets NOT bring politics into this...
11,01And wealth spreads around instead of the rich getting richer and poor getting poorer.
I was watching this thing that says that the federal reserve could be on of the major causes of the economy being sucky.
dat seaponies
heeeeey SuperBrony64 give meh all you slimez
11,01Greed is ruining the economy.
No
Nittany_Discord, that's not how economies work.
13greed is the economy
Money is
Money is everything in this "democracy" we live in
greed is everything
u know wait i'll stay up a bit for now
wat*
This mentality that pits the rich vs the poor IS the cancer that is destroying the economy.
11,02Since I realized that Minecraft music is boring, I'll play some Brony/Pony music >>
11,01Well, when a few people hold onto the wealth instead of spending their money, it doesn't go to hard working people.
This sounds nothing like sea ponies, I'm sorry.
Shizuka: and economy = a US Congress Man
Oh my fuck, why does it feel later than it is?????
inb4 creeper eats SB
gooooood mooooorning everypony! ;)
its night over here

somepony_else: Good morning in whatever timezone you're in o.O
gah! he does have slime!!!
11,01I don't want to start a political discussion. This is not PoliticsState.
is this pc or 360 version?
pc me thinks
Nittany_Discord: inb4 PoliticsState :D
Remember the 3 things you can't talk about.
PonyStationVita - pc of course
somepony_else hai http://derpibooru.org/75886?scope=scpe3125a2fdbbd5d9f1698be5f970a7a7aef2641afa
#State-Politico ? :3
lol ok then
why would you get the 360 version of minecraft?
do you hate yourself that much?
its a matter of self hate?
~yay~

Buytoast: U u give me yo slime!
Buytoast, SuperBrony64 isn't much of a PC gamer
I mostly watch Minecraft Griefing videos whenever I watch anything about minecraft on Youtube

3rd fav song
4th for me
hugs AJIsAwesome PaladinDrakkenwolf somepony_else
11,01I wouldn't hate the 360 so much if they didn't lock the console down tighter than Fort Knox and make you pay to do 80% of the things on that console.
SuperBrony64: pft, you should see the Iphone version :P
What version of MC is the 360 anyway?
God I'm so bored and my computer is broken. I'm going to browse Reddit on the phone. Be back later
now i must go, my sleep needs me
heres my opinion PC>360>Ipan/Iphone
lava dripping from the ceiling
11,01And forced almost all DLC to be paid.
ZAMBIES!
I never got the point of this game. It's cubes....
Wait you dont get the full version if you buy it Nittany_Discord ?
Its a TARP
11,01Spademagnes[R]: Minecraft?
11,01I dunno.
HOUSE KEEPING
11,02btw, anypony who wants to play this themselves later without the secrets spoiled, please don't watch the stream :)
Nittany_Discord: If thats what we're talking about, I might be a bit lost
00,02security on the 360 is interesting
So I might be talking out of my ass
Any you guys watch syndicateproject
11,01I think you can get the full version on the 360. You just can't mod it since you might have to mod your console.
00,02when Nittany_Discord says 'its locked down tighter than fort knox' he meensi t
00,02it '
13so kirz
13about to unleash a ton of chickens?
dat color
11,01Well, that means you can't customize it with custom-made content.
Just how strong is 360 security?
00,02Spademagnes[R], depends
11,01You have to buy what Microsoft sells.
is this classic texture pack?
00,02its code signing is quite rigid
and what song i this?
btw how doth i join other ppls minecraft games?
00,02only a few bugs have ever been found, all patched
11,01With my PS3, I was able to install free MLP themes without hardware mods.

00,02but if your a pirate, just flash the drive
cause it is
i used usb with ps3 themes
00,02then you can use burnt games
How much is Minecraft as of now?
oh singing telegram
0,14PUNCHING THIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIING
25$
i think
11,01The PS3 went the longest time without being jailbroken.
all dat emerald SuperBrony64
I might get it when I get a better comp
Nittany_Discord: Jailbroken ?
11,01And the they pulled update 3.14 on everyone, which pissed off the hacking community.
Nittany_Discord - because it had Linux. That's almost the first goal of "jailbreaking" a console
11,01Yep.
yeah... THEN it was game on
the ps3 hack thing back last year?
PonyStationVita - no, different kind of hacking
when the PS3 first came out, it had native "put your own OS" support on it
11,01And then some asshole that did an insanely-difficult jailbreak posted that he jailbroke his PS3.
i.e. you put in a Linux Live Disc, and your PS3 now runs Linux
11,01And Sony responded by removing the OtherOS feature.
Am I stupid if I think Hacking seems pointless?
11,01Which led to the PS3 being jailbroken.
WTF advertisement for Russian Wives.
Combat Arms has the most hackers in a pc game
SuperBrony64: jump
Spademagnes[R]: No.
How do I make ti go away?
buy one?
I just dont see why hacking would be benifitical to ANYONE
get adblock?
Its just going to bite you in the arse sooner or later
Spademagnes[R] - you obviously haven't met /b/...
I keep AdBlock off so i can help contribute to good videos. :S
Spademagnes[R]: It's only beneficial to the user, IMO.
gah, my headphones!
13i hacked my kindle
13best thing i ever did
kindle fire?
tbh
what'd you make it do Shizuka?
Dat bass
13no, don't want backlight
Zomeh!
you had to hack a kindle to turn OFF the backlight?
die
13kindle fire is ipad for people that can't afford ipad
so, say I wanna play this dungeon latter.... how would I go about joining?
I use a nook
Why the fuck would you hack a kindle?
Its a fucking book reader
13http://i.imgur.com/PvNPs.jpg so that i could make it do this
Spademagnes[R] - in cases like that, it's more on principle
13instead of ads
when I buy a console it is MINE to do with as I see fit, if I want to use online services with said console, I have that option, but the core is that *I* bought it with *MY* money so it is *MY* property to do with as I see fit
13^
SuperBrony64: same server right?, i havent been able to log on it for a few days now
case in point, that image
11,02Same server :)
who's streaming? :3
Hacking just seems unessicary
I dun know how to join server :(
now all you need to do it make it become self aware so then it can learn to KILL
you cannot do the same thing with automobiles, so why do I have to do that with my PS3?
I mean hacking a freaking book reader sounds stupid
13mfw sb uses essentials mod and DIDN'T turn off the tilde for nicks

Ryunosuke - are you referring to hacking or not hacking an automobile?
Nyan cat!
nyan cat

11,02I don't know how to use any of the mods...
WUB WUB WUB
13what plugins are you running
11,02I just put them there for people to use :/
13other than essentials
MirrorImage, I am talking about the ability to alter my property as I see fit
13you had better have worldedit and worldguard in there
13no worldedit..
13for shame..
broken back mountain is on yay
13FOR SHAME
if I want another OS on my PS3, that should be my choice, as if I want to put in another engine in my automobile, I have that choice
134SHM
SuperBrony64: wat do you think of the Rainbow Dash cutiemark i made?
I would never hack because, one I would most likely break shit and it usualy gets you in trouble
11,02I should have World Edit on here...
this is classic texture pack
is it
Spademagnes[R] - trouble with who? that's the point
13ja that's default textures
hello mr creeper
^^
lol creeper
kirzstryfe: you look cute on the stream :3
Wub wub wub
13SuperBrony64: not before he dropped a few hundred chickens down
00,02Spademagnes[R], the break shit part is what makes it fun
Oh hi creepers
13then you'd really wish you had worldedit for the mass entity kill
00,02Spademagnes[R], the 'getting in trouble' part is what people complain about
Phase4: I mean in the bad sense
XD
Like I would cause it to stop working
00,02it should not be ilicit for me to try change the software on my ps3
00,02Spademagnes[R], yeah, as i said, fun :P
wouldnt it be cool if minecraft came to ps vita or 3ds or fk how about ps3?
13as i suspected, creative for sb, survival for everyone else
So how deep are we?
uh Shizuka ...
11,02Pretty much everyone has creative Shizuka, kirzstryfe just only entered the server.
00,02Spademagnes[R], you learn much more from breaking something than you do from doing something right
0,14^
13inb4 someone gives him eggs :3
I would prefer to not brea something I dont have a replacement of
Majorly expensive equipment
Phase4: we learn from our mistakes, thats what makes us human
00,02^
Spademagnes[R]: dat ping :P
Shizuka Herobrine will provide the eggs to kirzstryfe
13back to mine anyway
Not that I have a issue with green but why so much Emeralds?
dat cutiemark crusaders theme
00,02Spademagnes[R], you can usualy be fairly safe, i brick my router every now and again trying to get new firmware onto it, but theres a recovery mode i can use to unbrick it
Spademagnes[R]: because theyre freaken Emerals :P
why do i have a feeling my power is going to go out any minute?
You..brick it?
00,02there are ways i can break the recovery mode but they're unlikely
00,02Spademagnes[R], make it unbootable
nether rock
o wait nvr mind
00,02^
Best term ever
well atleast we know you took all dem emarods, SuperBrony64 did
00,02was typing that but shizy explained it better

well i mean the glitch
spartan133t:its a bug in 1.4 its still on 1.3 so were safe
for now...
because it cant stay on 1.3 forever
DUN DUN DUN!
They'll fix the bug before 1.4 gets released, but as far as I know, the zombie children aren't supposed to burn in the day.
SuperBrony64: how I join servers?
What is he making?
Dovah: 1. enter server ip
11,02Dovah: You got to Multiplayer, then select 'Add' and type in the address for the server.
11,02go*

Dovah: 2. play
and in 1.4 zombies sometime shave iron shovels or have armor same with skeletions exept theyll have enchanted bows and sometimes have armor
SuperBrony64: ty!

I thought the main stereotype for Texans was thinking they were better than everyone else
no its that they r fat
ohai Dovah
hi HoodyNinja
I know way too many skinny people from texas
Its no fatter than the rest of the south
Germany?
texarkana?
Dovah: But that doesnt mean everyone is fat
Spademagnes[R]: but we are
I'm a stick
HoodyNinja: means everyone in those cities and everyone within 20 miles is fat.
its mostly true, though.
lots of fat people here.
Theres a stereotype in arkansas that everyone is either an inbred racist or involved in gangs, and its all true
^lol
Sigh...
Im not kidding
Wisconsin: It's too cold to be sober.
lol
Okay maybe their not inbred
argh i miss the winter :P
Sigh...
Bronystate or sleep
I live in Wisconsin, not sure how to respond to that comment Dovah
Hey everypony
There is some truth to every stereotype
hi DerpStar
Spademagnes[R]: I live in wisconsin too, the coldest part to be exact
Did I miss comminity?
DerpStar: Hello!

you must always remember that

DerpStar: yes
hi DerpStar how ya doin girl
Good and you HoodyNinja ?

Meh I feel like going to sleep, its 12:04 here but fuck that
^ But I have school
Oh wow
BTW.....nothing planned for tommorrow night?
Wait what happened
Why would over 1000 inmates want one guy dead?
someone want someone ded
It's 12 here also ^^
Oh i can't wait for RD to be in the game
Could be an elaborate prank
HoodyNinja: I want u ded
or do i 0.o
Dovah: dead*
you*
HoodyNinja: no ded not dead there is a difference and it is not a misspelling
Why would inmates care about that? Not to sound like a dick
So, 1000 inmates that are in there for similar reasons want to kill him?
Pfff.. really?
0,14You'd be surprised
People who are in jail actually care about kids?
Dovah: mispelling
0,14inmates have their own code of honors of sorts
HoodyNinja: Do i get to try out the ignore command for the first time?
0,14child molesters and their ilk tend to not last long in prison
Barbetos: No that was Afghanistan
Dovah: We have an ignore command?
that's what I heard
I'm surprised criminals actually gave a shit about kids
mmhmm
0,14hey
0,14even criminals have their own standards
inb4 SaxyPretender is really in prison
0,14pfffft
0,14I'm too much of a good guy to do crimes
Mmh mh
So why dont they let this guy die allready?

We understand XAX

Just in case.
XAX: Oh okay then

Polydunami: bl as in bad luck?
Bad luck?

Oh gag...
Not on my end
but i still like snow and stuff
Maid_RainBow: no stream did not dead you just too alive
SuperBrony64: needs repeaters
Oh geeze
I remember that game :S
ohh
eh Polydunami what you read is up to you, not a personal fan, but if the story is good i might consider it
that sucks, how come you don't have any AC?
*console
Yeah, I only read those books because they got high ratings on baka-updates :P
Move the repeater back a couple spots an you'll be fine.
i saw the word baka
...or that
are you talking about hentai?
It's a website and no, not hentai per se
11,02Spectrum_Rush: Already put repeaters on it :)
baka=idiot
youyube.
Buytoast: I think he means romance novels
Although I've seen high ratings for some of those, too.
Manga :P
oh okay
well i know what baka means, just i've seen it in alot of hentai
well theres not really a point cuz the summers pretty short. its ok right now, but during the middle of the summer its really hot
I read shipfics sometimes, doesnt mean im a lesbian
or does it?
wait imma guy, nvm
damn
SuperBrony64: i went by the fact that redstone dust doesn't hold power past 15 blocks... which is the problem you had afew times
Dang, this came about because of a misunderstanding on my part :S
Sorry, I must have missed something; what is being built at this moment?
11,02Well, I made sure to put in Red Stone repeaters on each floor for multiple purposes, including that one :)
Yes its all your fault

Im jus messin witcha :D
HoodyNinja: hey! dont be a jerk thats my job!

Something is wrong with this song :S

That's right
