Technically he said more, it's just impossible to comprehend any of it
thelonepony: There's a quote page on Wikia MLP
Hello. Came by after you suggested it on Omegle.
Because he was muttering his lines. >_>
with famous quotes
but Sombra only had 5 lines of dialogue
awesome, thanks :)
Don't you diss Admiral Sombrero of the Chilly Nip Tundra
Of course!
He's the king of the cuban beat~
hehe : 3
So what you up to?
Nothing really. Hanging around, I suppose.
Discussion topic: Favorite copypasta?
Buytoast: But adimral Sombrero is best guy ;3;
they're all terrible
Mine's the Internet Tough Guy.
oh, COPYpasta
Bet you thought iI said creepypasta.
some of these people can't shut up about those
Like Squidwards Suicide.
copypasta? wut?
Or how Pinkie is an undead being.
don't you start calling them out of the woodworks
Mike: okay, let's not go tthat deep into that conversation :S
that*
thelonepny: But I have the .png version of the pinkie one!
pls. let's not talk about creepypastas pls :S
awwwwwww
I just saw the news WOW
mitamaking: What was it covering?
what news
did someone get a cheap kill or something?
A thought:
mitamaking: Oh, the homepage news. Okay.
There was an interview?
i don't even know which horse she speaks for
mitamaking: pretty suprising I know right?
what news did you think?
mitamaking: General TV news.
Buytoast: Yellow quiet and Party Gum
Control will never conceal infantility.
Buytoast: Pinkie and Flutershy.
*Fluttershy
well at least she's the voice of the best horse
ugh
Well the US recognizing Syrian rebels is big, but not something I would discuss here
maybe i wont mute that pre thing then
Harmonica microphones are awesome.
05aaw yeah
AWWWWW YIS.
:/
who was that?
That feel when I could've seen The Wall live this year... ;___;
huh @__@.....
Drawing ponies is harder than I thought... http://imgur.com/ARJ0u
regrets were had LadyCanary : <?
Yes. But all good.
HEY. TEACHER! LEAVE THEM KIDS ALONE
Scootaflew: yeah, but you'll improve if you keep at it
someone I talked to on omegle
it's okay Scootaflew. :>
wat D:
All and all you're just another, brick in the wall~
NullRadix: I plan too
Keep on with it, and think simpler and simpler shapes all the time. And think fun and happy and the things you like about ponyness c:
:D
HEY
TEACHER
LEAVE THEM KIDS ALONE
Scootaflew: Practice Practice. You have to get through all your bad drawings to reach your good ones.
I just finished my OC... Should I share?
05say what you want
All and all, you're just another brick in the wall
05but you cant deny the awesomeness of the lighshow on thsi live play
LT_SKINNY: Go ahead. :)
LT_SKINNY: YESH c:
Wrek: a very anarchistic song. :P
Anyone know of any software that has better shapes than MS Paint?
funny, this time of the evening you can't even say what you want
Wrek: there's nothing i can say that has already been said by this masterpiece
Scootaflew: I think SAI is a good option.
never heard of it
of* this masterpiece
AJIsAwesome: I'll check it out
Sai is locked to windows. Try FireAlpaca, runs on anything and is free and launches in one second!
http://imgur.com/OSQ0M <-- Criticisms welcome :P
>_>
<_<
05there is a mac version of SAI
05but i dont know how stable it is
Scootaflew: SO, learn anything from MLPDS?
Oh right Wrek, but it doesn't work much...
LT_SKINNY, simple, you didn't draw it
FireAlpaca Scootaflew, MyPaint, even Seashore on OS X! :D
05CrystalPhoenix
05"<LT_SKINNY> I just finished my OC... Should I share?"
What's up?
05he didnt state he drew it
^ Thank you
DUUUUUUUUH?
wb Ponies47 :3
LT_SKINNY: The rear legs are closer to the viewer than the front legs.
/me noms on Ponies47 :3
LT_SKINNY: Hmm, not bad for your first try. The coat sort of clashes with the yellow boots, though. :)
hey everypony what's up
Mike: Well at the moment no response on my drawing. But it did help me realize what I learned from the drawing itself and to draw first in shapes, then everything else
WHOOOOO
Hi, StuffCrusader. Just enjoying Wrek stream.
Well then
LT_SKINNY: I dunno about them yellow cuffs man... ;3 X3 Do silver cufflinks on yellow cuffs!
LT_SKINNY: not bad, bro, not bad
hmm, so what's this?
Hi StuffCrusader
Dat bass. Mmmhmm
remove the clothes and your good
you're even
The idea was to make firefighter turnouts :P
I hate that typo
that bass is so badass
Scootaflew: Also, do you use a drawing tablet?
oh really? then yah yellow.
Cause, well Im a firefighter xD
Mike: No, but I have an iPhone, if that counts for anything :P
05i love when he rusn the steel guitar
is this a live concert
05liek 88 fingers edd
LT_SKINNY: Well, in that case the yellow's fine. :)
Mmmm.
Then I suggest for starting to draw, use good ol' pencil and paper.
^
ooh i ove drawing! who's drawing?
That's what I'm doing. I'm trying to get into drawing.
*love
When you get good, then save up for a good tablet for drawing.
I'd definitely like to start drawing. Maybe then I can move past Pony Creator :3
Why my back twitch.... ffffs
Stuffcrusader: Giving Scootaflew a first-flyers guide to drawing, MLPDrawingSchool STyle.
drawing ponies can be a pain for me. either their noses are wrong or their hair is screwed up
thinking of drawing... I should stream again one day
PIGGIES
Stuffcrusader: Try going from drawing anime to ponies. Doesn't fit well.
StuffCrusader: My logic is, it makes them unique
Kurra: Id like to watch :)
@_@....
Oh!
I has a thing
why is there a pig
no one approved of this
oh for fluff-- this still going on....
Yes <3
Wrek: What band was this again?
05Pink Floyd
Ah. Thanks. :)
Reminds me of NC... "Ask me what it means! Ask me what it means!"
meh i'm gonna go draw some stuff. by everypony
Bye, StuffCrusader.

LT_SKINNY: wanna see a thing? :D
Kurra: Sure! :P
it's an art I did years ago, just practicing, and it turned out poor by what I can do now, but it was still fun and a learning experience.
I'll be going. so tired right now -w-;;;;
Bye, Roxsnow. :)
/me yawns
Take care!
So there are still people in here.

Intersting show.

Pink Floyd.
Pink FLoyd Live.

It's designed by MC Esher.
Everything Pink Floyd can be classified "interesting" :D
This animation brought to you by....acid? ._.
CriticKitten: And MC Escher.
CriticKitten: and AEON FLUX
Pretty sure that
*that's the same thing
"To get back to the warning that I received. You may take it with however many grains of salt that you wish. That the brown acid that is circulating around us isn't too good. It is suggested that you stay away from that. Of course it's your own trip. So be my guest, but please be advised that there is a warning on that one, ok?"
-The host of Woodstock
Doctor: are you sexually active?
saw that in the youtube comments
uhhh
thats pretty random lol
I remember somebody making a comment on youtube
and then replys to himself
That keyboard setup is orgasmic.
to answer his own question
That's one big ass synth.
http://i47.tinypic.com/2qa5mdl.jpg
This is the slowest I've seen Manechat in...ever.
Me too.
.... o///o
Hi
hey
A year here, and this is the first time I've seen it slow down below a message every half a minute.
Kurra: What're you blushing about?
this music is helping me write
Vunderbar.
...God I feel old now.
YOU ARE OLD Reikim :|
I'm not watching stream, so I can only guess, but saying a keyboard setup is... that... must be some keyboard setup... I'd never use orgasmic to describe much outside of reproduction XDDDDD
one of my uncles is claiming that all bronies are gay he's never seen the episode i'm trying to defend my friends and my gf what do i do
YOU'RE OLDER, CANARY
SHUSH REIKIM
<3
OLD LADY
WRINKLES AND EVERYTHING
Old ladeeeeee
.___.
I'm likely older.
Kencolt beats me, but...
Kurra: I use it often to describe things of epic proportions.
i'm 20 and my gf is 13
Isn't Ken our resident geezer?
indeed. Understandable.
Like: Any riff by Jimmy Page is orgasmic.
I beat all the admins I think
Reikim: You could say that.
Are we back on age again?
Not really. :D
I'm one year older than you. >:|
Ah, the old age debate.
haha sorry Ive been moving in and out of the stream :D
xD
Permission to facedesk, Reikim?
DJBlaziken: I'd be hating if my son, 20 years old, had a thirteen year old GF.
permission granted
Canary, you may facedesk.
Facedesk commence
What, why are we facedesking?
*Wait
/me facedesks
20 years old with a 13 year old girlfriend?
what?
because you dont need all those braincells :D
Ohhh Mike beats me I think
she asked me
braincells are for the weak
Oh I have braincells.
djblazekin: what country you live in?
Buytoast: DJBlaziken's dad is hati ng on bronies and he, 2 years old, has a 13 year old GF
weakness is for the weak
usa the country that killed bin laden
Kurra: What do I beat You in?
age? no?
this shit sounds like a Maury special episode or something
Kurra: I'm fourteen.
/me facedesks once more
OOH MONEY :3
///)_-
/me follows Canary's lead
dat bass...
can't wait for the wall
PS4, possibly coming Summer 2013
"My daddy doesn't like my thirteen year old girlfriend of my obsession with horses, and I'm twenty years old!"
oh never mind then
the two are not blood related i hope
:o really?
this is much more interesting than my homework
who's dad is this then that doesn't like his son's 13 year old girlfriend or whatever :p
lol
DJBlazikens
I got my game informer magazine in the mail today, was reading it
me and her are not related
It just says that there are dev kits being sent out to some companys
hello everypony
well thank god for that :P
Hi, texasboykc09. :)
and a possible release date by Mid June
Ah, well that's something
Hello, someone with a name too hard to type out
hey texasboykc09
hi texasboykc09
Hi texasboykc09 :)
i hope that your "girlfriend" isn't just a waifu pillow with a picture of one of the horses on it
because then Maury might not even let you on
lol
Mike: lol
Mike: Type part of their name and push tab.
I hope when it comes out PS3 stays around as long as PS2 did
^
Buytoast: And I thought we were a nice fandom.
I hate having to buy new consoles
NICE?
We are... generally :D
Mike, would you like to learn about the wonders of tabbing nicks?
no my gf is a flesh and blood human
how is streaming?
*who
texasboykc09: Wrek is. :)
Streaming is good ^_^
Wrek
I hope that the PS4 can play PS3 games
/me abuses butter cookies
Wrek is baking, he's not here.
/me crumples in shame in his addiction
Buytoast, I've come to realize what we all have in common in this fandom.
I HAVE A PROBLEM i know oh luna waahhaah ;.
We all like My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic... and that's the one thing that all bronies have in common for sure.
pray tell, what is it
YOU DONT SAY.
WELL
Yeah
Kandarihu, I disagree
well i aint a brony so your logic is flawed from the get go
YOU MUST SO ENLIGHTENED
pink floyd
Thank you, captain obvious.
some bronies are only fan of the fandom
Can someone get that gif up here? :D
LT_SKINNY: Which one?
you know the one...
some bronies doesn't even watch the show
CrystalPhoenix: tru dis
I'm still hanging on to my PS2 because my PS3 isn't one of the backwards compatible ones =/
like in Touhou
did the wall part 1-3 play before i got here
the 2006 models of the PS3 play PS2 games...
Don't know the exact version though
_And_ my PS2 refuses to play PS1 games for some strange reason...
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-s36L0_gcaFw/TzK3C6a_g0I/AAAAAAAADlA/evP1hIwgZ2s/s1600/misc-you-dont-say-l.png
Yeah, a couple of the early models did
Hey. Touhou games are hard as balls. Can't blame half the fanbase for not having the willpower to play them.
But they're really rare
Nope.
No one wants to sell it if they have one
Reikim, one could AT LEAST TRY
Its definately on my collectors list
DJBlaziken: Non-DSotM like WYWH and a bit of The Wall played before you were here.
a lot in the fanbase doesn't even know it's a game
and if they do it's like $500
One does not simply TRY to play Touhou...
I found myself another atari computer today :D
Eh, you kind of learn to just deal with it.
oh nice
Like how bronies get to deal with...certain other segments of the fanbase.
definately made my morning :]
Reikim: Please don't hate on clopping.
I never said that...
Its called an Atari ST computer, released in 1985
Mike: Who said he was?
Reikim, you mean a dark part that's in EVERY FANBASE EVER
^
Anyway.
I don't get that
all the games for it are floppy disk based
do you ever boot them up and play with them, or are they just for collecting?
of course I boot them up
As long as the fanbase keeps cranking out quality fanart and remixes, I really couldn't care less how many of them have actually played the game.
What? "^"?
I'm just pointing out not to before someone does.
But collecting is a big part of it too
If the price is cheap enough, ill buy it because of how expensive they are online
LT_SKINNY: "^" means that you agree with the previous comment.
my uncle said i should bring and shoot all my mlp figures without crying
The one I bought today cost me $7 bucks
oh man
Wow, good deal
I know. I was refering to CyrstalPhoenix's "I don't get that"
Speaking of remixes, I ought to go pick up some more of TAM's stuff. Dude knows his way around a violin.
i'm sorry but i'm dying over here
it'd be like Old Yeller
they normally cost at least $50 online
"No pa, I'll put down ol' Twilight."
and if they have accessories, it can cost you close to $100
"Uncle, They're my toys, I
*'ll do it"
oh and for the record
the power adaptor is twice the size as the 360
XD
That's awesome
its insanely big
"Remember boy, right between the stickers."
ill have to take a pic of it sometime
O_O;
I'd hate to see what that would do to my electricty bill x_x
Buytoast: Okay, now its just getting dark...
who are we watching playing on stage?
Pink Floyd
^
good thing i haven't seen Old Yeller then
It's worth seeing.
oh I dont think it uses a lot of power
^
The old original movie.
US......AND Theeeem~
Yep. Good book, good movie
its big because its old
It can be very sad, and boring maybe, but... jeez i'm showing my age
ah, true
I probably won't be able to watch it seeing as my dog recently was euthanized about 6 months ago.
Screw it, go rave offa walls doing freerunning! XD
whats amazing is
it actually has a GUI
Mike: Apologies :(
Ouch, that sucks Mike.
awwh yah D:
Yeah, sucks. He was two months older than I was.
he was long lived!
wow
he even wants to burn my rd hoodie
Especially for a bigger dog like a pringer-spaniel.
*springer
I think that's awesome that a dog can live their entire life as you've lived all of yours so far.
^
Yep
in 1985? wow
I find it brings the tragic brevity of life into stark, poignant relief.
imagine living with someone all your life that you can play, cry, be with, and they never ever leave in all your life.
yup
well. To the good times in life that are worth remembering. *lifts his gatorade bottle*
you have your own trash bin, folders that you can click on the desktop
what's the OS called?

Eh, already been through the nostalgia pond once today. I'll pass.
Hi, Barbetos.
To Tigger
*slinks
ohai Barbetos
I saw the name somewhere, id have to look for it
Down, and UUUP~
Hi Barbetos
LadyCanary: Denied
What I found hilarious was that the VA for Winnie the Pooh was the VA for Robotnik in the SATam cartoon, if I recall.
?
Its cute when you try to be a grammer nazi Reikim
Pardon me, Mike?
I just got highlighted o_O
:D
Do it again you tool
AJIsAwesome: JIM CUMMINGS?
I don't try, my good friend.
You know you want too.
*It's
I learned from Meanwhile.
I don't have to try, because I am.
You missed grammar.
LadyCanary: The lyric goes " DOwn, and Out"
AJIsAwesome: Jeez, the more you know :D
Now you know----
*to on that last one.
Ho. So adorable. He even thinks that Meanwhile is a mentor.
Could've corrected me then Mike. >_>
KNOWING IS HALF THE BATTLE
AND KNOWING IS HALF THE BATTLE
Why does Meanwhile hate me? T_T
Meanwhile hates everyone
Barbetos: He hates you?
and I don't blame him
I wish he would take me under his swasticha.
Swastiker
swashbuckler
why hate lets hug
One may learn via simple observation.
Meanwhile DOES hate everyone.
I'm gonna get off, bai
Ok, gotta go everypony. gotta hit the hay........
Bye, Mike and Dark92Enigma-.
cya, Dark92Enigma-

Some times I ask myself, do I really care.
*Sometimes
And I always answer yes. Fsk this shit!
Hah. I knew I could get you to correct something from me. I betI cna gain.
=D
*I bet I can again
You really miss Meanwhile, don't you.

How about you dont run away.
Running is good for you
Cardio
MURIKA will never go to shit.
It's too mighty.
Because you're 20 years old, and that's such a childish thing to do.
Even gods may fall with the relentless passage of time.
LadyCanary ooooooohhhh.
MURIKA is stronger than gods.
ZUUUL
Does it make you feel like an adult to say childish?
i mean if we fall off the fiscal cliff
We have Uncle Sam's blood coursing through our rivers.
Barbetos: ...No...
His heart pumping courage into our souls.
Wow. I am being such a troll right now.
djblazekin: what fiscal cliff?
Dude, what did I ever do to you.
And his mind granting us wisdom beyond our years.
Nothing. I did not mean it in a mean way honestly.
my filter seems to be broken
Well it seemed liek you did.
The only constant in life is that there are no constants. This is the truth of impermanence; this is the imperfection of our world.
has anypony been watching the news
Best picture ever http://25.media.tumblr.com/36d1e422efe67bec399fff2710c01c26/tumblr_mewj0lwxcY1rvl3xdo2_1280.png
LadyCanary Yeah. I know. I am being a huge troll. I dunno why.
The only constant is that MURIKA will stand strong, on a mountain of eagles and Big macs.
Must be these drugs
CrystalPhoenix: :D
Barbetos: you mean those Cheetos?
They are pretty old
my gf told me age is just a number
The courts will tell you otherwise.
djblazekin, You are the biggest twat I've ever seen.
I apologize LadyCanary, and to everyone else in advance.
You aren't 20.
But not to Jmo
If you are honestly 20, you need to grow a fucking brain.
Barbetos, you rustle some jimmies
?**
we just wont let this age discussion die, will we? :D
age discussion
CrystalPhoenix Only my own.
17 HMU BOIZ
lel
XD
how dare you
HMU?
insult MURIKA'S proud boys
So djblazekin, for the love of god. Just go.
jmo.....
how many you?
Barbetos, Shhhh no tears, only dreams
Uncle Sam will hammer down his vengeance.
I dont freaking know...
lol, there is still age discussion
And you will beg the Mega Eagles for mercy.
Like IT Crowd.
And we would speak normal.
And we will grant it for we are true compatriots.
Also we would use metric
i thought we were done with this age talk
AVS619: We were...
Put THAT in your Oxford and dictionize it.
If there's one thing the US has to do pronto it's convert to metric already.
Barbetos, keep running around with the word 'troll' stamped to your forehead in dreams that you'll be one.
I think the problem with Barbetos tonight is that he took one too many of the smartass pills
If you want to be a troll, then you need a hobby.
We don't need no fancy metric system.
negitive vibes man lets get some positive vibes in here
Hell, the rest of the world should switch to ours!
Huh. I am really not trying to be a troll though.
Then don't say you are one.
If you think so, does that just justify me being one though?
You see what you want.
Even if it is not there.
so anyone here familliar with Pendulum
And I hate everything now
Ill just put a disclaimer before everything I say when I want to be a jackass :D
Hate everything?
Barbetos, what you want you to do is be smart.
You aren't Meanwhile, son.
Don't be like every other retard.
Barbetos: you aint Meanwhile, son
herdmiiiiiiiiiiind
I don't want to be anything but myself.
what I want you do to do*
And I don't have to justify anything to you.
i heard this for the end of lords of dogtown man best skate flick ever
Barbetos: HATERZ GONNA H8
....
GUISE
This song.
Gives me horrible feels.
i'm not sure wtf is going
Me neither.
You never will.
Let the positive vibrations of this song wash over this chat...
I am just talking on Bronystate like I normally do.
Good vibratios
/me sobs.
There's at least two different flavours of bullshit going on at the same time. It's wonderful.
*vibrations
The only good vibrations are the ones from those tootsie machines they got at Six flags.
Reikim: i sense a third tasting of sprinkles...
\
Oh how I wish...how I wish you was here.
Hell no.
Now.
I guess I pissed off the wrong people or something.
inb4 someone makes the obvious innuendo.
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl.
if anypony could be a hippie charecter in the show who would it be
Barbetos: somehow, yes
Gona get fitted for some cement shoes.
Reikim: ?
Oh don't you worry.
goodnight everypony
Night AVS619
Barb, drowning's a horrible way to die.

Drowning is one of the most horrible and painful ways to die, right up there with burning to death.

djblazekin, if anypony could give a shit, who would it be? No-one.

Although to be honest there aren't all that many pleasant ways to die outside of medically-administered euthanasia.
Is there anybody in there

Reikem that joke is far outdated
Goblins
Eh, I was out of material.

Here I was thinking you were reading a guide on landwhales potato.
Tried Erfworld yet?
Jmo: cut that out dammit
Reikim: enope, I'll check it later
LOl
so much to read
so little time
Potato, go read Erfworld.
Jmo: Chapter 5: they dont inhabit tivers
i think i'm tripping just from a combo of the lights and music
*rivers
otakon: Potato, go read Erfworld.
djblazekin, no, you're just being a retard and pretending that.
I'm sure you'll sympathize with the protagonist.
djblazekin: congrats, you're having a seizure
I will
Never go full retard :|
If he was having a seizure he wouldn't of even been able to type that.
^
Jmo: shush you, i want him to think hes having a seizure
mostly feeling light headed
Can't you get really mild seizures that leave you mostly conscious?
djblazekin: from all those Gummy vitamins amirite?
what a bad-ass we have here
Must be all that love for your under-aged girlfriend, going to your head.
Reikim depends. Theres the petite-mal and the grand-mal seizure
i wish i had gummy vitamins
nope
all i got are these walgreens ones you swallow whole and taste like cardboard
Reikim: Look em' up. Theyre both TL;DR
SO MUCJ SMOKE
*much
OH GOD Jmo
Pills aren't all that bad to swallow.
OH GOD LadyCanary.
:3
OH GOD DAMMIT DEARIES
Agreed, Reikim.
Reikim: some times they are
well no they aren't
Sorry, family medical history means I have no sympathy for anyone who complains about swallowing pills.
still, annoying that they taste shitty
Dry swallowing sucks ass. I always use water.
I never water
Anything. o_o
Swallowing them with water does help.
Well arent we quite the badass? :P
no we arent
No. I just smell bad.
Stimulates the natural swallowing motion of the esophagus.
Sexy
Esophagus?
We don't have snails in our mouths boy.
Its a kind of tomb.
doitagain
ZOMG JELLYFISH
Oh shit. I just did it again
Trying to decide whether you're really that stupid or just doing it because it's supposed to be funny.
^
Well maybe it's a throw up between them then.
No, Barb. It's two completely different kinds of stupidity. They're mutually exclusive stupidities.
Reikim if you have to think that hard you already lost your own battle in logic.
Try hard more.
And why do you care?
You should always ask that first
Cause I know sure as hell that I don't/
Barbetos, go eat some McDonalds, Reikim, go shag some meese.
Drop it and move on.
Meesen
^^
Its just for fun man, and if you don't get that then I am done with you.
Reikim isn't finding this fun.
Fuck that, the bastards have been chewing on my cables for ages. The only "shag" I'll get in relation to them will be the shag rug I make out of their fur.
i'm swettin like crazey still from playing dance central and ddr brb
Fun is not allowed here.
Fun is barred.
Reikim is shagadelic?
If I have offended you then I sincerely apologize.
YA BABY
Groovy, baby
\m/
djblazekin, quit trying to burn your calories, you'll forever be a bakery.
i cant sleep anymore..
Still though, this is the internet. Take it in jest or get out.
Its not all shitting rainbows all the time
ffs
i love how, if djblazekin is truly tripping off something, he decides to go on bronystate out of all possible things
Ponies have made you soft, and me sick
aniderp|bestcakeever: well stay with us then :P
Cool it, slick. Can't remember when you were made a mod.
Well, in order to shit rainbows, you'd need to eat lightly.
Hah. Its not even about that.
Gah. You pretentious ass holes make me nucking futs
05my timing seems good
Buytoast: :D
Wrek: So how are the scones?
Wreky!
hello Wrek
no it's the pink flod music that made me trip
I am done Wrek. I dunno why I am even trying.
Welcome back Wrek
and then everyone shuts up
or not
yey~ Wrek
05the yare jsut done
I am sorry to disturb everyones evening. Again.
You were trying now?
05ive set up my breakfast and is all ready to eat
djblazekin, the only thing you tripped was your feet.
05waitign for this to end so i can go eat
But aplogizing just gets me chastized more.
Wrek: how much longer
05a few minutes
A wise Buddhist once said: when nothing you do seems to work, do nothing.
^
When did gahndi say that?
afk for a moment
A wise shaman once said "It's not what about has I caused, it's what's on the Inside" XD]
05a wise teacher ones said: "read through, think through, act, control, control again."
05once*
A wise man once said, "Once man must stand on top a hill with his mouth open for a very very long time before a duck flies in"
that man was dari
Dabi isn't wise. He wishes he was.
A wise man once said :"Hello!"
05rock farm
05more commonly known as mine
05but without the digging into the earth
Mine?
Oi, rock farms confirmed for being around for the purposes of finding geodes.
mine mine mine mine

This isn't Finding Nemo.
Jmo: +mine my ass then
No
05aaand im done
NO

05this ending to this show is fantastic
Thanks, Wrek.

Fancy shmancy light show there

Thanks Wrek.

djblazekin: how do you know its red then?
thanks for the music Wrek
:)
sorry but i'm visually impared
that's not the only thing about you that's impaired
That's not the only thing.
djblazekin: to that extent, you must be legally blind and therefore cant type
Good BG music to work to Wrek, thanks.
HERD MIND Buytoast
guess so
Well he could be colour blind. But then, I've never heard of red/black colour blind. I'd call it unlikely.
IM ONLY BLIND FOR LOVE MAN ;___;
DONT H8
Go shag Neil in the closet.
No, that's just all the salt spray in your eyes.
gladly >:D
It's an original color blind Reikim
/me drops on the floor and head gets hit
Don't steal it
Ahahaha I'll admit that one was actually kind of good.
no i'm leagaly blind but i can type and read everypony who is not typing in red clearly
IM MY OWN ORIGINAL COLOR BLIND CHARACTER
BLEEJAYBLAZEKIN
djblazekin, are you also legally retarded?
no
illegally it is then
legally blind but can still type

13psst
MY CHARACTER IS PURPLE/WHITE COLOUR BLIND AND CONFUSES THE PRINCESSES AND KISSES CELESTIA INSTEAD OF LUNA AND *more bullshit*
well then again
ohai Shizuka.
13legally blind doesn't mean can't see light at all
ohey Shizuka
i guess there can be braile things
Hi Shizuka
Shizu!
^What Shizu said
Legal blindness can be corrected with glasses
hello Shizuka
13legally blind means your vision is impaired beyond the point of you being able to use your eyes effectively at all
shit, how is it spelled? braille?
13corrections or not
Legally blind is...what..0.5?
Back
13braille
13also canary canary <33
Jmo: ...dont tempt me
there we go
DO IT.
ohai Shizuka
fiiiine
Chirpy demands it.
Legally blind is...I believe 10% or less of your sight. Above that and you're merely visually impaired.
Huehuehuehue,
i can see well enough with my left eye but my right eye is fucked from birth blame my ex dad
yes, i thought about that. There is no such thing as Mine, they call it 'Rock farm' and there is no such thing as slavery, they call it friendship.
:p
djblazekin: Ouch
No, there are mines.
Rarity's been down them.
HAHAHA
yep, slavery was only friendship
13there is something greatly annoying me tonight...
Shizuka: Hai..?
Is it djblazekin?
I'll leave Shizuka :(
AJIsAwesome: jokez
Damn.
Shizuka: Make on
oen*
Notch is a lazy bastard
Shizuka because life's a bitch
13i found one..... for 1.0
13minecraft modding is stupid hard
Reikim: I dunno, but he looks fucking ghey
Shizuka: If it is, why is there gazillions of mods?
13they are better at it
^
13see, sure i coded the embed switcher in a day for this site
Reikim: If I recall, he's one of the characters on that internet show Epic Meal Time. Eggh, never really liked that show.
'It's like making love in a canoe.'
13but the code is hideous
Did a bit of sailing or some junk.
Reikim: yeah, the fucker
13so i'm going to try and fake it with redstone torches
is it working?
Awesome
Ah wait, maybe I'm confusing it with the glasses. Disregard what I said.
already done
AJ, don't worry about it~
Seriously don't.
jmo i feel offended by you can you pleez apologyze and stop being a parasprite
'tis all good
djblazekin, No.
Hah.
Wow.
so....
*Jmo *I *Please * apologize *douche
Here's a deal djblazekin, you go back to school and actually get an IQ level then I might consider saying sorry.
Shizuka: Redstone, Lava.... What more red is there?
Wool
mushrooms
mooshrooms
mushrooms on mooshrooms
djblazekin don't mind them. They just a little cranky.
Man it sure has been a slow week for streams hasn't it?
i graduated highscool with a c average
minecraft talk is shizu streaming ?
ohai TheGreatAndPowerfulT
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Nope.
Hm. This whole sitation seems fake.
All of it.
Hi Jmo
Reikim: Negative
13why so surprised
Because...
Yeah. I even think college is that way here too
...
Sure we may not be as great as China but who gives a crap
MURIKA strong.
The world does.
MURIKA mighty.
...You know, Shizu, you got a point.
Hai Jmo
Uncle Sam only grades us on our hearts.
lol
Hi Buytoast
What do you want The_Browncoat?
TheGentleManBrony*
Buytoast you are favorite now
We're pretty strongheaded when it comes to using the archaic imperial system, among others.
Barbetos . . . wat
Jmo I'm just saying hi.
damn
Hello to you too then.
What is so hard about it? Buytoast = favorite.
what's your problem?
. . . WAT
For now. I change my mind a lot though.
GOOD
I'm back again. What's going on now?
Archaic. Good word for the Imperial system. Personally I prefer outmoded and outdated, though.
You've done wrong by me. That's what.
AttackWithHugs stuff
AttackWithHugs: Not much
AttackWithHugs: Random as always.
Canadian_Brony: Again?
wb AttackWithHugs, nothin much
What did I do?
AttackWithHugs always o__O
LT_SKINNY, AJIsAwesome, thelonepony: nothing new
You bad mouthed a friend of mine, that's what.
Well then, lets play a game :)
Which friend was this?
LadyCanary ring any bells?
I already apologized to her.
Im thinking of a # between 1 and 100000
You better have.
79846
i have pretty close the iq of twilight
What do I win?
Buytoast: :O
And I was just sticking up for the other guy.
You were sticking up for a retard.
djblazekin, you have the IQ of Tom.
Buytoast: um... hugz?
No
Aren't you afraid of being a bit over baring Jmo ?
I don't want that
Tom has a positive IQ, Jmo.
*overbearing
lmao well I got $20?
Reikim, he does? Go figure.
Okay I'm not gonna argue cus I don't wanna get back into this.
I've already let it go.

Reikim: Forgive but never forget?
Reikim Ill remember that.
/me huggles aniderp|bestcakeever
I guess
I forget shit easily.
I am not being an ass or anything. I am just trying to understand why people seem to want to protect LadyCanary so much, or be nice to her. Hell even I do it.
Write it down on a note.
Must be the name.
Keep trying to understand. Maybe one day you'll get there.
I aint sayin nothin

Thanks, Wrek.
So four cm. I was close.

054cm!?
You were close Buytoast
No Wrek

Wrek that's what she said
05schools here dont close unless its -35 and snowing 1 meter a minute
community college exactly
hey Wrek again
Wrek same with Minnesota.
Well then its agreed. It sucks to be Wrek.
and parts of indiana
It sucks to be Minnesotan.
Schools don't close up here.
13but wrek makes awesome art
Ever.
I live in Canada. We've already had iced roads.
05Shizuka!!!!!
05<3
ie. the northern parts
13<3
also hi Shizuka
Snow; its all fun and games until you have to clear it out of the drive way
I hate Minnesota and love it at the same time.
But that's fun.
Reikim: Canada's main exports are snow and syrup :)
05mark knopfler is awesome
And candian accents
Haul out the snowblower and toss that crap around like you're some kind of mechanical snow god.
Reikim I've had ice roads since mid-November and snow back in early October.
Here I was thinking it was sheep and iron.
Eh
mmmmmmmm maple syrup
Damn, CB, where are you?
Reikim look at Vancouver
I thought it was shitty musicians with the exception of Rush and Guess Who.
LT_SKINNY bitch please, china makes those for us
Ahaha, yes.
now look 7 hours north

hiya Shizuka
Shizuka <3
Wrek I never thought I would see the day. Don't you mean Creed over Beiber? XD
Hi Shizuka
celien dion was greate
Lets just make it worse.
i'll be honest
no clue who this is
djblazekin, how would you know what talent is.
Hi Shizuka
In the same boat Buytoast
No clue who who is?
05Buytoast: main guitar/main singer of Dire straits
Haku1013: Last time I checked, they were flocking INTO our country, rather than China's trying to get out of their own country :P
Oh, stream.
anyone who thinks bieber has talent, has never heard real music :)
05made songs like money for nothin'
13http://i5.minus.com/id1ULp6Z3yWUD.png
can't say i'm familiar with em
05the really early MTV stuff
i was a 90's kid i listened to nirvana, stone tempal pilots, and beck
/me headdesks
Pics like that make me want to play minecraft.
good news guys
ah
Bitch, the only time we flock over to the US is to take advantage of your ridiculous sales weekend and the currency being at par.
would explain it
Yes, Starchaser?
Thats a beautiful MC house there, Shizuka.
I believe that in Chattanooga (I could be wrong about this), schools close if a single snowflake is seen.
Then I remember why I don't play it any more.
goddamned kids
We'll keep our healthcare thank you.
Canadian healthcare.
im going to bronycon 2013
Lies
Shameful
lucky bastard
excluding addele and korn most of all hit radio music is manufactured bs
I'll be sure not to go now.
Starchaser: NIce.
Jmo, it's still better than US healthcare.
Kandarihu: I know Austin, and for that matter Dallas, Tx does
Reikim, oh I know that. Very well
There should be an international Brony radio station
05US healthcare is great
There is.
Starchaser: You Tell Me This
05problem is only a small % can afford it
Okay, two things.
So Haku had an idea earlier
Don't make a radio station.
05but lets not start a political debate again
05so drop it
Haku1013: Im gonna call it off and give you the win :)
Pretty house, Shizuka
hell in 2002(?) austin tx was shut down for a week or two because of a dusting of snow
There's a brony radio station, it's called Celestia Radio, it's Internet and therefore beyond national boundaries.
13http://i1.minus.com/ibcTz4CrEpFH3r.png
We have a "Top Brony Songs" and "Top Brony Movies" lists
You should of posted a pic of ponies after that Wrek
What we need is a "Top Brony Fanfics" list thing
Ryunosuke: Wow.
Also the US healthcare is the best in the world...to those who can afford it.
Wrek, only a small proportion of the population can pay for it out of pocket. Everyone else depends on insurance.
Wrek Just like the top movies.songs
Haku, no "best" lists. That's just asking for crap.
"Top" Brony Fanfics
Stright from the bottom of the barrel
^
Its all community voted
05even if you havent ehard of him Buytoast
05its easy to enjoy :D
13http://i7.minus.com/ibkzhQbQflxL6V.png
No, not on Bronystate
How about no.
an actually event
this guy aint too bad
Like what Jaller and SS do on youtube
Seen too much crap writing.
not something i'd listen to all the time but not what i'd turn off immediately
THATS WY ITS COMMUNITY VOTED FOR THE BEST
Just a suggestion...
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Music of the Day #38
whos in favor of getting howar stern off the air and make everfree radio a satalit radio station
> implying community voting is a good thing
^
05eeeeeew everfree radio
All brains.
/me pukes
You know what else is community voted? That Top T.V. poll /mlp/ is rigging like a brand new ship.
Its better than most voting systems
13http://i3.minus.com/intFulh9Chb95.png
Well thats because we're organized
We MAKE ponies win
> implying we need to vote for something in the first place
Your idea is horrible.
Please stop.
Buytoast: ah yeah, that one. Who's winnig so far? :P
NO
Haku1013: By rigging the votes?
no -_-
Well last I saw the horses had like 2 million votes or something
and the closet to em
http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/cnishared/tools/shared/mediahub/05/20/00/slideshow_1002059578_rbz_Austin_in_Snow_43.jpg --- they call this "inclement weather" in austin tx
heheh
Wrek: whats wrong woth everfree radio
Yeah, I'm not usually one to shoot down ideas, but I'm forced to bring out the hunting rifle on this one.
Haku1013, the people who are voting multiple times are ruining it for the rest of us.
was like 50k with korra
Come on, help me lead it out behind the shed.
Even Vermin Supreme can come up with better ideas then you. Jeez.
The ones SS and Jaller use dont let you do multiple vots
05behave jmo
Lel.
I am behaving.
This conversation is slowly killing me...
cant wait till 2014 the journy of the spark releases
05not really you're beign an asshole
Can't you see the halo hovering over my head?
Jmo You can insult me all you want; you can even call my ideas terrible, but no one... NO ONE makes fun of Vermin Supreme
I wasn't making fun of him.
besides, if there was a "top" fanfic thing, it'd just be filled with the stories applauded by Sir Dragonwanker of the Truffle Bluffed Hills
Jmo I was making a point. Shut up, Haku wins, end of story
Haku, it's a wonderful idea. Not the best place to be airing it, though. You'd have better luck on /mlp/ or some other forum.
nyeh
13all right seriously
13chill
^
05xXDr4g0nSlay3rXz_98
Jmo Is that a fat joke?
05best
05username
05ever
Why are you here giving it to us where nothing will be done, anyway? Take it to /mlp/ and make it happen.
/me applauds
Haku: whats the significane of the third person thing?
I make ideas, but I dont take action
05also my hands smell of flour and butter
05i.e baking
LT_SKINNY eh, something I do.
05i can see why you enjoy baking bread Shizuka :D
13wrek muscling in on mah turf :P
Haku1013: Ty. Just curious.
05oh please, I am but an amateur
needs moar cupcakes
negative vibes man lets breath in and out and spread positive vibes everypony
Haku is a baker in training
Wrek: How were the scones?
You aren't a hippy.
13minecraft sucks for interior design..
If you cannot act on your ideas then they are useless. You cannot rely on others to make them happen; if you want something to happen you have to roll up your sleeves and get 'er done. This is how good ideas become good realities.
Something I have learned over the years.
Not in the mood for a lecture man
positive wubs.
13did rei just quote larry the cable guy
what did I deidle to? D:
Then get off the internet.
Mebbe.
goddamn you two are at it like two ants at the lion's pit
Jmo, I'm getting something done right now.
Seriously, I need to go to bread
13i don't care who you are that's funny right there
Im about to collapse
Not you Reikim.
Reikim: Shizu saw wat u did there :P
but I dont want to
Bronystate calls me
Then shush with your ideas.

It's a wrong number then Haku1013.
Buytoast what number?
You said it's calling you.

Haha
05back with more coffee

Can we get a new thread going here?
Im off to bread
Night, Haku1013.
NEW THREAD: pi

If I had a nickel for every happy-go-lucky kid running around yelling "I'VE GOT THE BEST IDEA" I'd be a damn millionaire.

Eeyup.

I dont normally like talk-singing, but this guy pulls it off
Indeed.... -.-
13i tripped on a power cable is that bad?
13it was labelled "bronystate chat"
D:
Chat's quiet and lively sometimes.

I guess you're on a POWER TRIP?
Chat's actually more lively than it was an hour ago.

Gah, I hate it when I forget to type out words.

13travel five minutes to get somewhere, die in three seconds
So anyway, I had fun showing off my new jaded glasses today, but I'm probably off to bed now.
Shizuka: PS2 is a team based vehicles game, if you didnt do a team in vehicles you didnt do it right
Night, Reikim. :)
Night Reikim.
Shizuka: death jump :)
13everyone else is spending gobs of money on certs to win
night everypony
g'night, Reikim
Night Reikim :)
night, texasboykc09. :)
05Shizuka: you cant buy certs with cash
Night texasboykc09 :)
Good night, Bronystate.
13can buy weapons though
13and cert boost
also, having the best weapons means absolutely DICK
Shizuka: can buy weapons in team fortress 2 also, doesnt make you win
you can be quite proficient with non-best weapons
hello chat thing ima tree and a potato
Hey JRP2234
You're also a third thing that you'll never know.
Hi JRP2234
13that's cause TF2 works hard to make everything balanced, plus random drops
13the statistics i've been reading is you have to play around 70 hours or more to generate enough certs for a single weapon for a single class for a single character
05only if you want the 100 cert ones
05there are plenty of good 100, 250 and 500 cert oens
on my primary weapon for infiltrator
05heck the GD-22S is the most well used and considered best in slot for ehavy assault
ive got 200 certs and only have about 8 hours in
05it costs 100 to unlock
Sounds like a certain Gameloft P2W game I know of... :P
I have EXACTLY 1 mod for it, the 12x scope
05but i agreee
13is mostly turning me off by how little it does to entice a player used to faster paced and more balanced things like tf2
05unlocked items being character bound and not account bound
05that is bullshit
13going the MMO route means they need to have income, so the price balance tilts heavily towards pay2win
05i wouldnt say the game is released yet though
05it sayd it went to open beta
^
13like i said on /r/planetside, they've taken the minecraft approach
05for isntance it still lacks alot of icnentive and meta game features that were promised
13slap a "released!" sticker on it and fix no more bugs than in beta
meh its a sony mmo, they will find a way to screw it up
05hehe
05taken all quirks i have with the game into account
13it works for minecraft because minecraft is very simple and bugs are well expected
05ocne i got a hang of takign myself around the maps
05etc
and some can be exploited
05im realyl enjoying it
Didnt MC also have a pretty sizeable community upon release?
13planetside is a massive game with one of the most massive developers behind it, bugs at release of the magnitude reported is just stupid
05Shizuka: for isntance you missed a blatant speedhacker on stream when i was playing earlier
@wreck who is the artist
05was a scattermax though so i woned his faic
i just think flying the airships is too complex...
13was just not as much fun :/
05djblazekin: Mark Knopfler
05once of my favorite guitarists
LT_SKINNY yes, and it's development stages lasted for years.
for my first time hearing him
13so much time wasted on respawning or just getting to your objective, not that your objective will be there when you get there an hour later
05TTK could be anotehr second
05that way youd be abel to react when shot :|
it doesnt take an hour to get where you are going, or you are doing something wrong, which I admit doing sometimes :)
That would mean there was plenty of time between alpha and release for the community to help Mojang QT the game.
05instead of spawnign and everyoen beign careful with their spawn life
13run to objective, instakilled from behind, wait 10 seconds to respawn, try spawning closer, get spawncamped
05the respawn is so farst it warrants sheep herds of players
05marchign togetehr
thats your problem Shizuka, you dont spawn as close as you can
05pushign agasint a wall untill it finally falls over
13sometimes i don't get a choice
13plenty of times they were all up at the front managing to not die
13the nearest i was allowed to get was a cell back
05djblazekin: u like? :p
13which led to hiking for ten minutes only to die two seconds upon reaching the front, assuming i got up that far
i've had to hike up to 1500m on more than one occasion
thats a bitch
13it's just so much "go here and die over and over and over"
yes it's 20% cooler than whats on the radio right now
13tf2 i can at least HIT something..
13even once..
Goodmorning **
^^
I can hit things up to... 600m off?
Hi, Arcium.
Shizuka: Was there anything good you found about the game, at least?
13it looks pretty
ya, the bolt rifle is nice :)
:D
13that's... about it
Hi Arcium
:D
05ooooo
05dat guitar
13capturable cells is nice but that's just a three way larger version of 5CP, and i don't like 5CP
05shiiinyy
13too much stalemate not enough accomplishment
i would agree with that
Thats war in general...?
05CTF cap bases are coming :3
there isnt that great of an incentive to conquer continents imo
13getting even a single damage dealing hit, let alone a single kill, was my greatest accomplishment possible with PS2... even with all these guys that have been on it for months
oh trust me, you will die more often than not
13don't feel like i'm part of a bigger thing, just feel like it's doing everything it can to keep me from playing
at least for me, and what I have seen of wrek :p
That sounds like me on any online deathmatch :P
13and when a game doesn't want me to play, i just don't, i have 200 other games in my library perfectly happy to take me back
05Ryunosuke: hey ive had my fair share of streaks :P
as have I :)
Well I apologize about the hard time you had, Shizuka.
/me sneaks up behind Jmo and hugs him
05oh also
05Shizuka
but when you have the large fights, you have to be a bit more... intelligent than Run forward, guns blazing
13if anything i was very very spoiled by tf2's careful design... SOE must have not heard of silhouettes at all because every single player, friendly or not, looks identical
/me hands Shizuka one of his scones with lemon marmelade and a cup o' tea
13scoooooones~
13we got some blueberry muffin mix, will have to make that tomorrow~
/me huggles AttackWithHugs
Dat fluffeh :3
Shizuka: Nice.... :O
/me turns into a jumbo pillow
Dat Jaymo :3
05i wish the game had a recert
05i would even pay for one
05casue id put all certs ive spent on infiltrator in max unit and liberator
05as it is now the infil is so under performing its silly
05we can snipe
dat feel when your on your computer and your mum decides to turn off your power with no warning
05but thats about it
wb JRP2234 :D
JRP lol
it happend to me today
13i used to do that with tribes...
i rarely use the cloak myself
05luckily they are doing class "revamps"
05they are starting with MAX and light assault
oh good
05definign their roles a bit more
05dunno which two comes aftrer that
05but i hope infil is in there
Good to hear theyre dedicating time to something important like that
00,10So I walk past the vending machines at work today.

13sumi
13http://i3.minus.com/intFulh9Chb95.png
I'm making a desktop pony sprite for her and a cutie mark would be nice
Is that her, Shizuka?
00,10nice shizu
13all today so far
00,10also did not know you could hang up clocks in MC
05there you had it
Yep, Canadian_Brony. :)
13ja item frames 1.4.0
Very beautiful
00,10spiffty

Maps, clocks, compasses, literally ANYTHING can be put in an item frame
05did you get it Canadian_Brony?
00,10Lady C is almost as good a looking pony as I am =p
13still need to fill in the kitchen and dining area and figure out what to do with the massive open area....

13it's big enough for a thaumcraft infusion altar
comin' along pretty good.
00,10a what?
back to her sprite
Not bad, then again, Wrek doesn't do bad.
13i would probably have to stream to get proper input on this
13but will be too late at night before wrek finishes so maybe tomorrow
BRAIN: You need to get some sleep befor school!
00,10Shizu should try towns
hmm
Bronystate: How about no.
Sleep? On Bronystate? Never. :D
what would an invisible cutie mark look like?
:p
:D
invisible
next time I see Canary I'll have to ask her if she has an /idea/ for her cutie mark, even that I can work off of.
applebloom is HAWT
Ask applebloom

there's this one guy in the programming class I'm always complaining about
He knows like everything about the language we're using and loves it
whereas I hate it and find it so confusing it makes me want to punch things
another new artist for me
So of course that guy does all the work

Well, I'm awake now :P METAL! :D

Night
hopefully :)
05love this song
needs 20% more siezure
LT_SKINNY speed diffrence
that would be nice
JRP2234: Oh silly me :P
pal = 50fps ntsc = 60fps
were you going to bed too Afflict?
Couldnt cartridge tilting certain games switch that around? I vaguely remember LoZ being capable of doing it
05that works
no
oh ok
no the hardware in a pal n64 pervents it from playing at 60 fps
idk why jmo was mean to me
I could list the reasons.
its somthing to do with the voltage diffrence
djblazekin: butthurt most likely
Lol 'butthurt'
a pal n64 runs at a diffrent voltage rate
soit can only run at 50fps
so it*
JRP2234: I read you. I was thinking of Mhz :)
Jmo, mean. Nah that's just Jmo being nice.
mean?*
Have you lost any loved ones before Afflict?
Rainbow Dash? Not sure. :D
and do you consider baking a cooking 2 different skills?
Yes.
In some cases, yes.
so by that logic can pinkie pie cook?
Id be eager to try something Pinkie Pie cooked :)
it would prolly be loaded with diabeetus
especialy her cupcakes
Dont care; worth it. :D
So there name IS Sabaton !
luckily no
their*
wrek should i get ps2?
ps2 is free
if spike actualy was a full grown he'd eat meat not jewls so thus there'd be bbq in equestria
djblazekin: are dragons eating flesh canon?
05god i love this band :D
djblazekin: its widely acepted gryphons eat meat
how is wrek playing ps2 and watching this
JRP2234, two monitors?
multiple pcs
the magic of win 7
053 monitors
3? :O
damn
3...
2 more than I got :D
I hope you wont have to experience what I had to go through for a real long time
how big are they
05go the concert on one
heh i could technically hook up 5 to my pc..
05together with streamign software
05chat on one
05game oncenter
They're great!
Id never make it as a mod :P
but parsing out the sounds is a pain.. setting each app to a different audio
Gah, I'm going to clock out early. I have one of my finals early in the morning. Night, everyone. :)
Goodnight AJIsAwesome, try to sleep this time :P
Good night AJIsAwesome. Good luck on those finals!

You can only imagine the connection they had in 35A.D.
man, atleast they had one XD
thanks
erm.. you know A.D is after death...
yeah, but bc would be worse
I thought 0 signified his birth... no...?
It did.
05A.D
05who's he?
Im a lapsed Catholic, so Im gonna take what youre saying and assume youre right :D
Who's who?
AD is not after his death.
Drew: Its a joke :P
oh lol :(
i didn't catch that
Please repeat entire speech in English? xD
yeah...!
LT_SKINNY: fat chance of that happening
11,02Does anyone remember those scenes in manga where a character is depressed and it gets all black the background with lines around the character to represent how down he/she feels?
otakon: fair enough... but a Yankee can dream.
hi SuperBrony64
ohai SuperBrony64
11,02Hai :)
SuperBrony64: yeah?
and no, never read manga
SuperBrony64: what about them?
Ohai SuperBrony64
11,02Anyone have a link to a sample image of it?
...
I think so...?
lemme see...
pfft you seem to think anyone here reads
enope
Well i'm going to sleep, Goodnight everyone

That is a very interesting post on the front page, SuperBrony64
11,02Polydunami: Indeed it is
SuperBrony64: Like this? http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Manga_emotions-EN.jpg
Well, this place is going to be jammed for longer than usual
On Saturday, that is
I, for one, am looking forward to it :) :P
Uhh, I remember singing this in the morning after a late night Wrek stream haha
11,02LT_SKINNY: Sort of, but instead it's with the background. Kind of like where there are all lines in the background to represent sudden shocking moments? Instead it's a black background with lines to represent depression
SuperBrony64: Shit... I know what youre talking about but Im blanking on examples...
I've seen good examples on Azumanga Daioh, if I know what you guys are talking about... :S
11,02I'm kind of thinking of a scene with Foxy from One Piece when someone tells him something negative...but I can't think of a moment when he does it
Hmm..
well, I'm getting real sleepy, am going to head off to bed
Blockhead
05he lost his pilot sunglasses durign the intro
As far as the anime is concerned, this happens right after the G8 filler arc.
05and asked the crowd if anyone could spare a pair
As in, the arc where Foxy appears
05but then they pointed out they fell behind him
xD
yeah me to

They seem really friendly

Are you looking for a model to work from or something?
11,02Okay, thanks~ That helps a bit :3
Glad I could help :)
05please dont think pewdiepie when you hear sweden
05think these guys
05:P
My first thought is, "Who is Pewdiepie?"
I havent watched his stuff in awhile...
^
And how would I associate him with Sweden?
^
I mean, he does have something of an accent, but I had no idea it was Swedish
08,01who would have a bigger funeral, shatner or patrick stewart?
Besides, I dont associate Swedes as scared little pussies

"Not my job to spin the Wheels of Torment. 's Brother Plasterer's job, spinning the Wheels of Torment--"
Well, Patrick Stewart is kind of British.
and Stewart is British so...?
pfft
British
Now now, Canada was once a British colony
And French, but that's beside the point
And French*
we still are . . .
kinda
Didnt you claim independence or something?
ehh, somethin' like that. We don't get to learn about awesome stuff like that in Social Studies. It's going to be Aboriginals this year . . . eeugh
Canada is an independent republic, but still has connections with the British Royal Crown
Sounds murky and uninteresting :I
Grade 10 Social Studies is so boring, the human incarnation of Pinkie Pie (aka my SS teacher in Grade 8+9) has trouble making it interesting
Wait, it's not a republic. Its official name is just that. Canada.
C. Eh. N. Eh. D. Eh.
or, as 'Muricans pronounce it, Cah-Nay-Dah
Whoa there, Canadian_Brony. SS can stand for something else entirely.
But I digress
to the internet!
away!
FML.... spreck en ze engrish??
let's see, we got something about the Nazis, and . . . . .
O_____O
Shh
Now is not the time

Hi Allegr0

08,01PonyNegZero: yup
I'm rather disappointed in myself for taking that long to think of it....
08,01which can actually be simplified to e(t - 1)
It was stupid hard unless you read the book
Never would have heard of the book without TV Tropes :P
08,01er, e^(t - 1)
Oh whoops

Yes, TV Tropes can be good for some things :P

(obvious pony reference should have been obvious)
08,01i love computer architecture
I love mechanical engineering and design
Oh god... Katawa Shoujo :I
Hm? Is that a problem?
No, Im just recalling the feels :D
I want to know what something does, why it does that, and how can I turn it into a toaster.
Oh, I see
-_(\
Canadian_Brony: my desktop used to make a fantastic toaster until I added more fans...
'tis all good, brother :)
PonyNegZero xD
Canadian_Brony: it could toast a graphics card, I don't see why it couldn't do bread...

RawketLawnchair: Nah I would ..well.. take a stance
RawketLawnchair: Only way for Revy to think
Revy, where?
i think i'd be able to calm her down and get her to run my way
Wrek: Trouble with Ustream? You dc from the embed sometimes when changing movie/Show?
djblazekin: ha good luck with that
and I get random feed blackouts too
05nah im usign the built in media player casue its easier than havign say VLC playing in the backround
you think i would die before i could make her my gf
05but for some reason it freezes when i try to add a new file
Wrek: Make sense.
fun fact, a lot of the MLP VAs did the the English dub of Black Lagoon
[]DeadpoolDash: Fun fact, been told
djblazekin: you'd be lucky to finish a sentence
You need to pique her curiosity to speak to her
Therefore, a stance
That's the edged conversation
but shes selfish too
dont forget that
That's why you should pique her interest
It's HER interest after all
so dose revvy have a love life outside this
but that would only work for so long
then she looses interest
and then ded
oni_link: Siblinghood to Rock
oni_link: As I said, edged conversatio
<--- War begun
Step 3
Sneaky.
hey wrek do you have Roberta's Blood Trail OVAs?
they are all fucked
best eyes
Tiny.
<--- Dat Limo
Now she gets it
Dat radio pack
Shot the tvs lol
What about the video tape
Screw your TV show!
they wanted the COD4 achievement
XD
cod4 achievment
dat spetznaz
<--- Rock's getting naive again
aw I do see the soft spot she has with Rock now Vordox
its cute hahahah
oni_link: Siblinghood :P
yeah
:3
But may become more
But...
We're talking about Revy, so I have low hope
IKR
but who knows
what was the cod 4 achievement you were talking about oni_link
He was capable of breaking her down
oni_link: Once
djblazekin: Your show sucks
you shoot every tv
Vordox: if there's an opening, theres a chance
djblazekin: yeah thats why I brought it up when those guys shot up the TVs
rock and revvy or genji and revvy
Well
Cop time
Oooh
HAHAHAH
I see what they are doing
lol
smart
Revy has feelings for Rock, but those feelings get all confused. Plus Rock is pretty oblivious to it.
Well that f'cked up Hotel Moscow's first disguise
Funny how it works eh?
<---
Suddenly
They know EVERY LOCATION
lol smoke
I hate you
Why though?
She's too torn
Torn?
Yes
We've managed to avoid drowning.
Her ideals
dat pontiac gto
I like the way she gets things done
That's the thing
She gets things done
Not questioning them
Is there any need to
she is surgical and sticks to the plan
?
[]DeadpoolDash: That's why.....
I see holes in all her words.
11,02Happy 12/12/12 day everyone!
Rock, logic doesn't work on her
she NEVER can see the logic...
Gettin' emotionally involved.
woot!
<--- This is why I dislike her
She's torn
:| darkness once more
everyone is a potential enemy
SuperBrony64, I would have noticed XD
wouldnt have **
oni_link: Got a glimpse of what I see?
and should be crushed when they are no longer useful
Vordox: kinda but not as much as if I didn't keep getting blackouts :/
Thereby, torn ideals. :P
Happy 12/12/12, SuperBrony64. :)
her ideal is to win
oh yeah 12/12/12
<--- This is what I like about Rock
lol wow
my head was in the clouds
And this is how you pique interest
Stance of value
entertainment: check
NOT EVEN CLOSE
lol
daww, she likes him
lmao XD
Dark__Horst: More like jealousy
this is funny right here
basicly revvy is the sam jackson of anime chaerecters dropping f bombs left and right
SuperBrony64: May I ask for your help with something? :)
All I heard was ," Anyone but you I wouldn't risk myself for"
Chat, why do you crash so much? :D
<--- wtf Revy

Wrek: Got no school today?

Post Mortem
Ah, I see.
Where I discuss the end of an project to a finicky details that's the learning experience of the 2 week project I had last week
this scene, lolz
I've fired an M16A4,M203 underbarrel grenade launcher, M249 SAW and an M240B
i gungasm'd
that sounds like fun
I've used Shotgun(Not sure what kind), AK4, Ak5, KSP90, Gun(not sure on kind); Grenades(Shock and explosive)
yeah real fun
but what range lets you fire 40mm grenades?
Of course, AK4-5 had attachments, including Red Sight, Iron Sight, Grenade Launcher.
okay you lot
I'm out of here for now
Black Lagoon? Well ok then.
it's 5:20 in the am
Weird
I'm not getting a stream
otakon: good morning to you

Vordox: there is one
Is the stream going?
I have nothing

Vordox: refresh, Black Lagoon
Den här webbsidan är inte tillgänglig

JRP2234: lol wow
You all know what's scary?

Yukio's vision was the same as Rock's first vision
Dark__Horst: I'm still waiting for female protagonist in GTA. Maybe Rockstar will ad one in DLC to V...
Vordox: ghosties?
SirGanjalf: meh
Brb guys going to gp take my quick shower
i can do with out and if its a good enough character, ill get behind it
hopefully the English dub of the OVAs using the original VAs
AWW COME ON
good alloy
Sword guy should have died in two second
or better yet gta vi a charecter creater
She had at least 3 instances to finish it already
*s
damn your ridicouls sword fighting skills! In the Raiders of the Lost Ark this was much easier!
SirGanjalf: Ikr :D
<--- This is the worst speech
Not as in quality
But content
FUCK BARETTA
wonder if i shoudl enter quilibrium into the lottery
*equilibrium
I want that scene to be seen in an anime :D just to establish that guns>swords
ded
HOW
Damnit Recy youre getting sloppy
ouch
That looks painful.
that's gotta hurt
*revy
ow
That makes sense
Welcome to consequences Yukio.....
inb4 sepukku
simpaku time?
revvy used to be a gun slinger till she took a sward to the knee
ahhhh
sword*
:O
djblazekin: Leave.
AW COME ON
^^^
u did it worng!!!!!
Dem sounds
very wrong
y u censor :c
Why anime people are so eager to kill themselves
IKR
you stab it in the belly and them move it around
MadSurge: To teach us
Dark__Horst: And you should do it with a shorter sword
no suicide scene then again i saw many deaths in higurashi
She's wearing a wig XD
OOPS I AM FREE NO I CAN'T GO ON *slits throat*
djblazekin: I loved that one too.
MadSurge: Wrong MadSurge
SirGanjalf: they call those wakizashi
eeyup
MadSurge: It's teaching us to think
more of a knife than a sword
Vordox: well I think all day
rika's suicide made my date almost barf
MadSurge: Would you think of these scenes without the influence of Black Lagoon?
the OVAs are so much more gruesome
djblazekin: how, you see nothing
Vordox: I know nothing of this anime...
MadSurge: Good
djblazekin: lol i was shocked but thats it
i see well with my left eye it's my right eye thats fucked up
Lawl Eda
she cant stand mk9 and the fatalities
Guess she's a wuss.
why Eda remind me of that red head chick from Bleach who ALWAYS try to hit on chicks? :D
suddenly trailer
Planetside 2! :D
o.o
<... HAHAHAHHAHA NOT BRAINWASHED
WTF
Yeah NC!
HAHHAHAHAHAHAH
FUCKING IDIOTS
and that's why you go NC
'MURIKA
Live free in the NC.
FUCK YEAH
Wrek: Are you seeing these people's reaction...?
So is there any difference between the factions?
AdamTheDuck:the terrans actually, that's more
Good morning Bronystate
Too bad I can't run it
wut
Mornin' Gold_Demona
did just happen to my sentence
Gold_Demona! <3
05yes there is difference
Dark__Horst, but freedom and all that ;~;
Yay, Wrek stream! =D
AdamTheDuck: sure, but thge nc fights for it's OWN freedom, not playing world police. they're rebels
MadSurge: Mostly in weapon and vehicle specifics. There's not a lot of the political stuff relevant to gameplay.
This sounds just like an Army ad XD
civilians that took up arms
I don't know, I just see the NC as the "fuck you we do what we fucking well want" faction
there real isnt any ingame storyline
Meanwhile: well of course, I meant gameplay differences
Meanwhile: seems every faction is a bunch of jerks anyway
my problem with TR is their weapons handle like CoD guns with built in no-spread hacks
MadSurge, ikr XD
SO you can choose factions?
Everyone is a jerk, just pick the jerks you like.
sure
oni_link, you side with one, yes/
one of my other fave animes are angel beats and deadman wonderland
Meanwhile: exactly
that is pretty badass
05the Vanu
I wish I could run this game :c
05spandex wearing dubsteppers
^
religious cultist fanatics
lmao
Wrek: You know what...
Wrek: Ordos, Harkonnen and Atreides
05and to plug my own faction
The best faction you mean.
damn, i must finally check ou PS2. Maybe in New Year...
violence
SirGanjalf: it's free
me too SirGanjalf
hopefully by then
<--- I create my own Faction
The Straighteners
00,10dat video
05come to th NC
05we got flamethrower MAX units
And we dont take any shizzz
00,10and best looken tanks
Amen to that.
Wrek: But your faction has no form
also our guns fell like GUNS!
I will once I can run it!
Can you shuffle between factions or are you permanently stuck to one after you choose?
*feel
lol am i the only one seeing these 3 factions as the 3 pony tribes? :D
MadSurge: you make a character, he has a faction
MadSurge: You can have multiple characters but you're restricted to one faction per server. (I think)
Meanwhile, ^
hey loojk a poni http://www.loscaballos.org/images/poni.jpg
11,02New newsletter posted on the site~ http://www.bronystate.net/newsletter/
Sketch_Toku_Brony: naaah someone probably already made the connection :D
i hope my new parts arrive til weekend. would suck if i'd miss the firday session
holy sheeeet its Slayer
MadSurge: oh :P
ouo: aaaah pretty horsie :3
hey, wrek stole my reaver
MadSurge: lol it would be more like Luna Rebuplic vs Solar Empire vs...Discord maybe? :D lol idk
i just need to replace my amd atlon x2 5000+
Sketch_Toku_Brony: egghead union
and my graphics card then i'm set
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Pegasi vs Unicorns vs Earth Ponies :D
lol
Dark__Horst: lol if they do Twi's adorkable dance then count me in :D
that's one thing missing in this game. dance emotes
every mmo needs dance emotes
Im hoping that by next month I can get my new laptop and then shortly a desktop
And then Ill pick this game up
MadSurge c:
http://www.freewebs.com/onnelantila/poni.jpg fluffy one
Sketch_Toku_Brony: I don't trust no unicorn nor pegasuseseseseseses
What was that thing he just put on the floor?
MadSurge: lol
Is PS2 Free?
with the processor i mentioned would i be able to run this game
ouo: dat pony
Vordox, yes
Okay fine
I'll help you Wrek
But not because of the faction
F2P
it has micro transactions though be weary
or am I thinking of Tribes Ascend
how mutch is tribes assend
its free as well
what are the system requirements to run games like Minecraft,TF2 ect.? kind of a pc noob and was thinkin of upgrading my pc next year :$
so since this is a persistant game, is there ever going to be an end to it?
cuz i got the cod blops ii care package for ps3 and now i need a good pc fps to counter the console
oni_link, nope
Sketch_Toku_Brony: you can check most of that stuff on Steam or google the game for the system reqs
oni_link: i see thanks :$
There room in your squad Wrek?
Sketch_Toku_Brony: you can also use can you run it to check if your current hardware can run stuff
http://funzoo.ru/uploads/posts/2010-05/thumbs/1272988162_poni_001.jpg
can you run it requires a plugin install but its a one time thing
oni_link: huh yeah though i hope to find out what i can do to make my pc stop from lagging as much as it does on YT or Stream,ect. then work that out :)
i know crysis 3 is out of the question for me
that awkward thing
oni_link: THAT and play HD vids w/ little to no prob at all :$
Sketch_Toku_Brony: might be ram or a lack of processing power
still dont get why they didnt just keep working with the first crysis engine. that one was efficient as hell
or maybe its a gpu thing too
oni_link: hmm any recommendations for upgrading?
Well what do you currently have?
i'm going to upgrade my desktop and i'm wondering if i should get the i 5 or i7 overclocked
i5 should bhe enough
i7s are usually way more money for a only a small edge
athlon x2 5000+
but if you have the money of course
djblazekin: well if you can afford an i7 it doesnt hurt to go all the way lol (dirty mind sorry) if not an i5 is enough
not really, i have i7 3770k with 670gtx, 16gb ram and ps2 still laging after playing 2 hours or more
and what graphics card
ouo: then you're cooling is inefficient
no
it 45C
then again, planetside eats a lot of performance
all time
djblazekin: IMO, AMD gives you more for your money
*your
i feel so bad about that
05planetside 2 is far from optimized
right now i have a geforce 6150le
05an i5 should run it easely once the opt patch comes
last time i checked, amd processors are usually behind intel
the bulldozer system doesnt really cut it
sorry for the long postoni_link: not a PC expert so yeah :$ lets see here... an emachines W3107 pc w/ AMD Sempron Processor 3100+ (1.80 GHz,1600 MH FSB,256 KB L2 Cache) 100 GB ATA Hard Drive, 512MB DDR SDRAM, 56 K ITU V92
512...
`?
yep ps2 retty bad optimzid, i beleave it has some bad memleaks
wow. that machine is WAY behind middle class
ouo more like LOD
Well... Maybe it would be better to just buy a new machine Sketch_Toku_Brony
building one is pretty cheap
btw, if anyone things about more ram, always go for ddr3
it'S dead cheap
Planetside 2 = Take you to a gay bar 0 NC
:D
XD
it's gameplay befor graphics for me like girls personality befor looks
I think my motherboard is too old for ddr3. =/
for example, a kingston hyperx ddr3 8GB set only costs 35 bucks. the same in ddr2 would be over 100+
to me at the end of the day, ram is ram
im not so picky with it
Hey night all got to hit the hey
Ram = power
night Moopy
2gb ddr2 ram
Not CPU
Night Moopy
8gb ram is something everybody should have these days
23 bucks, it's cheap
*
35
Dark__Horst: If you have the motherboard for it, lol
Vordox: yeah I meant in terms of capacity though
I care more about getting 8GB and up more than if its DDR3 or whatever
Ram is the capacity
Gold_Demona: that's the trick the industry does. and the reason ddr2 is so expensive. if you're stuck with an ddr2 only board, you'll have to pay many, many moneys
so what machine would be good?
Let's put an analogy
We have a sprinter
He has a Mind(CPU) that handles things in accordance
Sketch_Toku_Brony: whats your budget?
His muscles are the RAM
Dark__Horst: Yeah, that's what I have. ddr2 =/
Gold_Demona: asrock z77 pro3. four ddr3 slots, costs about 85
hi
that's what i ordered recently
hiyo aniderp|bestcakeever
oni_link: well this feb. im gettin 500$ i hope anyway :$
also a nice 1155 cpu socket
Dark__Horst: When we get around to rebuilding my computer, I'll consider that. If there's not something better by then. :D
that's the one you want
Sketch_Toku_Brony: theres alot of 500 and below kits shown on youtube
oni_link: yeah i ve seen them but im such a PC noob im worried i would screw it up :D
Sketch_Toku_Brony: should be way enough for a proper gaming rig
ps2 almost has some similaroties to hslo i'm liking it
Sketch_Toku_Brony: well theres websites you can try that build them for you and ship em to your home
i know alternate in germany
otherwise, no idea
oni_link: huh didnt know that,are they expensive?
My hubby and I like to buy the parts and build them together. :>
Makes the PCs more special
Sketch_Toku_Brony: usually not. those are like amazon, only for hardware
dose new egg do the pre install
Sketch_Toku_Brony: I recommend you get around 800 bucks to get a decent Desktop
I know that ibuypower and cyberpowerpc do prebuilt
used to have a desktop from them
Sketch_Toku_Brony: the construction service usually costs extra though. i know one that charges 70
cyberpower pc that is
then I had to sell it since i was short money for bills and such
800 can build a pretty smoking fast machine, if done right
hi Gold_Demona
PonyNegZero speaks the truth
you also have to plan ahead for upgrades
oni_link: I speak from experience...
when in doubt, reag gaming magazines
hi aniderp|bestcakeever :>
i feel better
they usually have hardware testing parts and shopping guides
11,02Anypony wanna see one of the first newsletters I ever did? /).(\
the real trick is to find someone who actually knows what they're doing...
SuperBrony64: Sure. :)
huh anyone know a good Guide on YT or something?
SuperBrony64: doooiiit+
when do i gte the email? xD
11,02http://i1204.photobucket.com/albums/bb401/SuperBrony64/BronyStateNewsletter10132011.jpg Moo~
PonyNegZero: as do I. I spent 640 on a SLI desktop with an X4 black edition processor like a few years ago. that was the one I had to sell
SuperBrony64, sure :$
larger numbers aren't always better
just the username is good no links :P
SuperBrony64, so MLG :P
11,02ikr~
ha, i rmember that one
i'm getting sleepy /) to everypony thanks for the pc advice
11,02Now it looks like this :3 http://i.imgur.com/J0TKq.png
oni_link: why did you sell it?
SuperBrony64: This is from the beginning of Season 2? :O
11,02Yesh :o
Wow, that's OLD.
11,02I was a mod on the site for about 13 days~
lol
PonyNegZero: I needed moeny to help out my parents with their bills and such
SuperBrony64: It's a great improvement since then. :)
that was from 2011...
oni_link: fair enough. I've meant to build a computer for the last 5 years, finally got to it last summer
wow how the hell did I get down to 72MB of storage space...
11,02Also note how I screwed up the name of the episode in it :P
oni_link, you got to cut off on the porn man
lol cant believe my pc is sooo old :D i feel like a blank flank :$
oni_link: windows 7?
PonyNegZero: Yeah, after I buy a new laptop Im gonna get to building another desktop :3
Dark__Horst: eyup
oni_link: yeah, does weird things to your harddrive
i'm going to hit the hay i'm a vampire good day everypony/)
11,02And yes, people fought us on the 'Twister is an A Movie' thing~
SuperBrony64: What? :D
is DELL a good machine? my friend's pc is dell and despite the hate of it,it looked like it ran amazing
11,02AJIsAwesome: The newsletter :3
SuperBrony64: do i get email today?
oni_link: celest, how much money do you have?
of course he built it and what not :$
11,02aniderp|bestcakeever: You will sometime today~
SuperBrony64: No, I mean the whole Twister debate. XD
ok
http://fav.me/d5nw13b
11,02AJIsAwesome: Yeah, people were upset saying that Twister wasn't an A movie
PonyNegZero: Well I know that by next month if I don't spend anything I'll have $1800
There were people who thought Twister was a B movie? O_o
and then the following month Ill buy a desktop
Gold_Demona, Twister IS a B movie
i got question
AdamTheDuck: lmao I has no pronz in here
oni_link: if that's what you really want to spend your money on, fine by me
what is the diference between a and b movie?
11,02Also notice how I won the pony episode that week /)u(\ It was the first week of having movies and pony episodes picked using a survey instead of picking names randomly in the chat.
wasnt twister acclaimed for being a B movie when it came out and they were surprised a B movie was getting the press it was
11,02aniderp|bestcakeever: Check the FAQs on the site :P
Maybe it's because I grew up in a place where Twister was a really popular movie, but I don't see it. >.>
PonyNegZero: It is, Im only going to work for a year and then I'm going to school to become a network administrator.
didnt people die in twister?
aniderp|bestcakeever: Yup
and some lady held onto the house during it barely holding on?
aniderp|bestcakeever: Lots of people died in that movie. :P
Im working for the sake of getting money, still live with parents and theyre going to pay for my college
am i right about the lady grabbing onto the house about to fall?
oni_link: I wouldn't, but hey, it's not my money
oh btw, to all of you planning on building their own desktops, do NEVER buy CPUs with their stock fans. buy both extra. becasue these stock fans are usually far from sufficient
11,02The first week of October was the first time we ever did the surveys for the lottery, the method that you use today for entering the lottery~
aniderp|bestcakeever: I don't think so...
11,02It was my idea /)u(\
they're only made strong enough to keep the cpu from dying during open office or things like that
I can count the number of people who care on one hand.
how do i get to the chat while on my ipod touch? o.O
ipod can do irc chat?
PonyNegZero: oh dont get me wrong though. After I get things off my list of stuff to buy, Im going to save the rest. In two months, I should have enough to buy everything I need and then I'll put the rest of my earnings in a savings accont
11,02I think Meanwhile was there too~
well i tried coming here from quakenet.. but didnt work
last chance to chose on the regalia SpeccyRush
need to find the client that will do this place..
can i make a newsletter? :D
So, just minding my own business, playing Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops, and what just happens to intrude in my espionage game?

11,02aniderp|bestcakeever: Sure :D
oni_link: if you say so (half of my problem was I didn't have a 64 bit machine and I'm a computer engineering major)
neat
XD
but i need all the info o.O
You can't escape ponies.
11,02aniderp|bestcakeever: All of it...even...the secrets?
>.>
secrets?
dem secrets <.<
11,02You know, secret mod stuff.
D:
i dotn nmeed that stuff
SuperBrony64, first rule of BronyState secrets, you do not talk abour BronyState secrets >.>
i mean the info for the newsletter
about*
08,01PonyNegZero: do you use pi or tau usually?
so, ampstations looking like big spaceships parked for anyone elseß
?
guess what pony i will choose for thing thingy :D
08,01you should start using tau instead
08,01you all should
08,01because it makes more sense.
11,02aniderp|bestcakeever: If you want to make up a newsletter, try using the info I put in to this week's newsletter and let me see what you can do :3
05electric six music on stream
I don't even know what that is. >.>
PonyNegZero: Thats part of my problem now. I bought a Macbook (used-late 2008[the model since Apple is kinda derpy in their model identification]) with gift money and I can't run Windows 7 in 64 bit and Im stuck with the gpu in this thing for now
i swear, if you fly in from the side with the landing pads, it looks like the gargantuan love-child of a reaver and a galaxy
/me 08,01uses tau in exams; makes a note at top of paper "for this script, let tau = 2*pi, globally"
11,02aniderp|bestcakeever: Note we're not hiring, but it's cool to see what you can do anyway :D
oni_link: my laptop is 32 bit, but it works for what I need it to do
08,01PonyNegZero: none of mine do either, but i just set it for courseworks and exams
08,01and memorise anything i need to memorise using tau instead of pi
05this is a good time for lunch
I also wanted to try OSX and see if all the bashing on Apple was just for the heck of it or not and I can honestly say without prejudice that I don't like Apple in terms of laptops...
08,01Vordox: this is more important
08,01PonyNegZero: well, fair enough; we don't have any electronic assessment here
Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops is ruined for me now. I can't take this game seriously.
...
oni_link: bashing apple has nothing to do with thei os, it's becasue of their bullshit price policies+
You're not SUPPOSED to take ANY of the series seriously
hmm but i wouldnt know if there would be guest stars xD
08,01Moonbutt: coming from someone called "moonbutt", this is quite a statement
A relative term :P
maybe i can be a guest star? xD
Dark__Horst: and also being stuck with the components they choose and not being able to do simple upgrades
08,01Dark__Horst: exactly
It's just hard to get into the mood of the game when Tara Strong voices a major character.
oni_link: that too
08,01in fact, Mac OS X is a brilliant OS
08,01iOS isn't really to my taste, but it's not bad
Thats the main reason I don't like em Dark__Horst
but i would be sorta nervous ;_;
It's like when I was playing Command and Conquer 3, and Dr. Cameron, Lando, and that guy from Lost are the entire cast.
I grew bored of iOS because I used to use an iPod Touch for everything (this was before I had a phone)
i once heard in na digimon episode the entire german cast of SG1
Android has so many options and its so... open
i would say sea ponies :P
imagine that brick
ya know what would be an awesome idea? Cutie Mark pc skins and horn/wings for each CM :D
pc skins? Like case covers? O_o
Tara Strong is awesome, but, she's forever Twilight Sparkle in my head. Hard to see the actual character when I hear purple smart.
Gold_Demona: YEAH! :D
that'S called case-modding
05i like this song
05anyways
05I will be grabbing lunch
PonyNegZero: https://www.dropbox.com/s/g4hvs2to938pql9/system%20specs.png This is what I've been stuck with for the last few years now. the gpu is at 256MB and it says I have 2.7GB of RAM but thats usable RAM. I don't get why that is though. I guess its because Im on 32 bit or something. And Apple being Apple doesn't allow 64 bit
05might show a movie after that if you guys are interested
Dark__Horst: yeah but like have funny little things like a Dash one would have little wings :D lol
Wrek: i would be
I would love to have a Pinkie Pie mouse pad
Wrek, which movie?
oni_link: I don't know my graphics card offhand, but I have 2.2 core 2 duo, and 4 gigs of ram (upgraded from 2 over last summer)
When was Planetside 2 released Wrek?
As far as doing any pony case mods, I feel its a bit too much. But they do look cool
PonyNegZero: We have similar hardware :o
Wrek what server do you play PS2 on?
oni_link: and mine works great still...
oni_link: i was thinking more like those nfl wall things that ya can remove? sort of like that
but ah well :D
oni_link: but Pinkie hates arrows :D
PonyNegZero: Yeah, this works fine too. its just that Ive been yearning for some pc gaming and being limited to this hardware kinda reminds me that I should upgrade and get a new laptop
Does anyone use a drawing tablet here? I have a question :p
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Ummmmm like sticker skins?
MadSurge: lol too bad for her then
oni_link: but what do you really plan to do with your laptop if you have a good desktop?
My PC has an apple decal on it, just because I like to be contrary. :I
05back with lucnh
oni_link: yeah! something like that
Is it yummy lucnh, Wrek? :D
05who many are here
Sketch_Toku_Brony: decals!
05and will stay for aprox 2 hours?
oni_link: yes!
Wrek: yo
I never leave, does that count?
Wrek: Whatcha' got?
I'l be here as many hours as you want, Wrek. ;D
Wrek: not going anywhere
ohai Mojay!~
/me hugs Jmo
Allo Dema
/me huggles Gold_Demona
Gold_Demona: so what you've been playing lately?
i'll be in here for a while
MadSurge: Lately? Mostly Star Wars: The Old Republic. Got a little further on Assassin's Creed a couple days ago. I'll eventually finish it and get to the second game, I swear. :D
oni_link, not playing your games on the desktop?
oni_link: well, I don't have that kind of money to just throw around, it just seems excessive in my mind
where's you brain?
MadSurge: Also a lot of Pokemon White 2
I'll eventually get back to my Nuzlocke, I swear. :D
Gold_Demona: :D
>_>
OH MY GOD.
dat stream
YOU SLACKER DEMA.
http://funzoo.ru/uploads/posts/2010-05/1272988162_poni_001.jpg cute boy c:
CrystalPhoenix: Knowing me, if I did I would have to invest in a high end monitor and a new desk and get a nice mouse and keyboard and get my surround system up again even though I cant use it here since its too loud
05my audio driver bucked up
Gold_Demona: I just finished an obscure Squaresoft RPG and now playing a freeware metroidvania called An Untitled Story
A laptop is simpler to use
I dont have to be in a desk for it
Thats just me though
ouo: HNNNNGH
PonyNegZero: Not really HTPCs are fairly cheap
Thats what the desktop will be
05fixed it
05starting back up
Yay~
05casue i promised id show these 2 again
MadSurge: which Squaresoft RPG?
oni_link: if you say so, I built my good desktop (which was actually a lot less than most of my friends) and I expect it to last at least 4 years
oni_link: I your 1800 is way over what I plan to spend in a while
oni_link: Treasure of the Rudra
I spent 1800 over the course of 2 years I think
I don't expect to upgrade anything but hdd for quite a while
05ok
PonyNegZero: Its a hell of alot cheaper to get a desktop of course but I mean if I can afford it, why not?
05ill play this song
05then start
08,01http://i.imgur.com/AeDGT.jpg
11,02And then we need to do the secret BronyState thing
11,02Opps...wrong channel.
SuperBrony64: What, open the Bronystate Forum for public?
I mean
what
MadSurge: oh awesome I can get that rom :3
11,02lol wut
oni_link: because you have to worry about heat, batteries, and the future of the machine
11,02Forums are just a myth~
oni_link: get the translated version :D it never left japan
05SuperBrony64 should definetly stay and watch what im going to show next
11,02Wrek: But...but...3:45 AM ;3;
SuperBrony64: Yeaaah.. a myth~
05nonsense
SuperBrony64: dat "mistake" >_>
PonyNegZero: Yeah, thats true. Cooling solutions suck for laptops and its slim to no chance I can upgrade
SuperBrony64: but but 6:45 am...
11,02Alright, I'm watching for a little bit Wrek ><
11,02btw, I want your art skillz Wrek~
PonyNegZero: I guess if I get a nice enough place to set it down and a good enough seat then its worth not having the comfort of staying in bed to use it
aww yeah
11,02This about poniez?
SuperBrony64: There's a few Horses yes
Yay! I finished hand drawing my OC guys!

AJIsAwesome: How does "Mystic Lore" sound for a pony name?
:O AJIsAwesome!
Rule nr 1: You shalt not kill
Reality : Woot?

Vordox: This is war, killing is okay. God says so.
DoctoDoctorWho: Seems like an interesting name, go for it. :)

Sketch_Toku_Brony: Thats good, I was shooting for a name that expresses my special talent.
Translation error

DoctoDoctorWho: cool,so what would his talent be? a historian of some sort?

D:
DECAPITATIOOOOON!
<--- Wrek: Was that Skåne's mark?
05no,
05closer to norway
REally?
05but below stockholm
i can't read words like Skåne :O
Did you know that full plate armor gives a higher range of motion than chain mail?
Wrek: http://images.vector-images.com/132/skane.gif You sure?
Along with better protection.
DoctoDoctorWho: Wrong
Chain mail is safer against everything
05Vordox: boarders were different back then silly filly :P
Wrek: Damn my history knowledge
DoctoDoctorWho: Chain Mail stops any kind of attacks that's bigger then the chain mail's holes
DoctoDoctorWho: No matter what type, it's WAY heavier though then Plate
05which is why arrows were effective agaisnt cahinmail
05the tip broke the chains
Yeah
05and it jsut pierced the thin plate
Vordox: It cant stop a stab worth its life and slashing is only moderatly garunteed to be stopped. They tested it on deadliest warrior.
Wrek: YOu COULD lower the hole radius but...heavier.
It has zero advantages
05best defence is to be the one that strieks first
If I would go to war, I would wear it. :P
(Back then that is)
Also, you forgot a few things DoctoDoctorWho
In Deadliest Warriors, they are testing things wrongly
Unless you were wearing like, battleship chains, its not gonna stop shit.
08,01my god, i cannot concentrate today
08,01i have an exam tomorrow, and i'm finding it so hard to revise
o.o
08,01maybe drinking large amounts of caffeine will help
Exam?
DoctoDoctorWho: Besides, I prefer mobility of Chain Mail over the mobility restrictions of Full Plate
08,01AdamTheDuck: Programming Language Design and Implementation exam
08,01it's my last one
If it's only tomorrow, go caffeine crazy
08,012.5 hours long
I have a circuits exam in 5 hours from now (no sleep for me...)
You can sleep after you've finished them
So , a little boy fell from a tower , and theres a crow , and winter is coming ...... this could crossover into game of thrones at any moment.
08,01it's only midday anyway
I have an exam in a couple hours, but I think I'm ready.
gtg
But they forgot the most important part
Human Mind
Wrek: Mail armour provided an effective defence against slashing blows by an edged weapon and penetration by thrusting and piercing weapons; in fact a study conducted at the Royal Armouries at Leeds concluded that "it is almost impossible to penetrate using any conventional medieval weapon"
as I said
If I got to war, Chainmail is the first thing I would take
05a cloth shirt
05then the mail on top of that
05then a leatehr tunic
05adn a cape/hood
05sword
05hidden dagger in case of emergency
05(or axe)
05and bow n arrow
05and im set
Also this Wrek
Some evidence indicates that during armoured combat the intention was to actually get around the armour rather than through it—according to a study of skeletons found in Visby, Sweden, a majority of the skeletons showed wounds on less well protected legs.
Gold_Demona: muffin?
aniderp|bestcakeever:
Sure =D
Wrek: Bow and arrow, you mean LongBow right?
05duh
/me gives muffins
I see we have almost equal taste of equipment. :P
For veik for veik er kongens bue!
Yey :>
/me noms muffin
longbow would be tricky to move with
english longbow, at least
they're really, really long
dafuq is this?
Dark__Horst: True, but it's range is REALLY REALLY ood
infantry carried artillery, pretty much
And the precision...
Gah, gotta reboot. Bbl
05if im moving throug hthe forsest
05sneaking up on an encampment
what is on right now?
oh, i also missed the start, what are we watching?
/me grans Gold_Demona to dance
05takign out with arrows before meleeing would give you better odds

oh, i remmber that movie
http://news.astv.ru/files/news/imagecache/one_new/front/76833388_2222299_poni3.jpg
it's a good one
Wrek: I wish I could live once in the medieval times...
fluffy
I wish I could go to the future. First thing I will do is go onto Youtube, and look up MLP:FiM S3E7, then 8, then 9, all the way to where it is up to. Yeah. :)
05an axe is also a good tool to parry with
Vordox, you probably got slaved then...
Vordox: no you dont. you really dont
ouo: Hardly.
I said wish to live "ONCE"
implying, a test trial period :P
h

nope. Arn

SuperBrony64|Zzz your still sleeping

AJIsAwesome: also, break a leg! :D

i probably would fucked up if i seen that one in my bed http://www.arachne.org.au/_dbase_upl/P1011611.jpg
Vordox: It's three 12's. That's it. :P
Gold_Demona: I'm sorry I can't find it interesting :P
there actually are flying scorpions
BOOOBIEEEES
look ouo, it's a spider with wings
Vordox: Cuz you're weird. ¬_¬
OoO
Tabrenus: COMIC SANS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I might do something special for this day. XD
he can fly?
Gold_Demona: Yeah sorry for thinking Universe. :P
Vordox, don't worry, you're not alone :P
Vordox: Huh? O_o
<--- Virginity failure :P
yep flying spiders.
But it's funny. :<
look at this little fucker
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wUA9SFYCfRw/TJtRAH62bTI/AAAAAAAABNw/AwCKfOEKTAI/s1600/scorpion_fly01.jpg
Hmm, I wonder if a new version of CCCP is coming out today.
it's a scorpion
You don't often see a date where all three numbers are the same. :<
with wingsa
Gold_Demona: I see time as something unthinkable, therefore it does not exist. :P
I see time as a clock
everything else is phsyics and uninteresting to me
Gold_Demona: I see it all the time. :D
01.01.01 = Noone was happy about that
02.02.02 = Noone complaind about that too
Or was happy
numbers are forbidden in ponyville
10/10/10: the best date ever :$
Then when 12 12 12 comes, It's all "yay" while I go "urgh"...
I just find it funny and interesting. =/
I don't most people even notice
Gold_Demona: As I said, it's your fun. :P
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xA1wiD8KzoU/T9VnqC4DSDI/AAAAAAAAUF0/Q_8FpJl_BJ4/s1600/Flying%2BSpider.jpg
Neither happy or sad about it, just amused
I remember 7/7/7. Loved that day. :D
It's unique if time was correct, but time is not correct. XD
For the past few years, the CCCP Project timed their releases on the dates that matched the month and year.
ouo: yeah, but that one's not real
Gold_Demona: It's complicated,but you are right, this is a once in history moment
057/7/7 was awesoem due to 7 beign the number for infinity
Vordox: Well, once a century anyway. :P

^^
Oh yeah
1111-11-11- <-- Now we're talking :P

Meanwhile: unlike words that are not

I think swedish cheif should be a language
aniderp|bestcakeever, aww, but it was just a dream :<
SpeccyRush: Indeed.
08,01oh! sumica!
08,01i had a dream about you last night!
00,10ohmy
08,01you were eating cheese, seductively

05sumis OC has kidn of become the bronystate neighborhod joyride
it wasnt my fault.. and i took a elevator down or something then had something like work enviroment dream o.O
08,01it didn't leave much to the imagination
Wrek, ikr :$
Wrek: <.<
00,10lawl wrek
Wrek: And who can we blame?
08,01Wrek: it wasn't his OC
05im innosint
aniderp|bestcakeever, that's one strange dream .-.
00,10well then wrek we need more arts then

/me 08,01is keeping a tally of bronystate dreams
and chat start being too colored
/me bakes aniderp|bestcakeever a cookie cake to feel better
08,01recently, i've had one about nittany, sumi, and shizu
Creepy.
00,10inb4 group orgi dream

/me wants his text to be colorful
Sumica, XD

i forgot what happend though
08,01ouo: all the homo!
lawl
05ouo: implying homo matters
/me 08,01homos at wrek
08,01i was a hobo once
/me watches
stay classy mane
/me 08,01homos AdamTheDuck
Implying you still aren't.
/me homos SpeccyRush
i once lived in the streets myself
08,01it's homo hour, in #bronystate
00,10Can I sleep on your couch, no hobo
go fuck yourself sith :)
it was fun, i stole everything i needed to survive
i was once an orphan
SpeccyRush: already did
08,01Rose`Bed: livin' rough brohoof /)
<--- In your face Rikissa
(\
who wants to hear the story of my orphanhood?
Nobody.
Dpm
aniderp|bestcakeever: sure
08,01i had to dumpster dive for food
xD
Don't be mean Meanwhile :<
00,10Never got to the point where I was on the streets but did spend alot of tome liveing in a motel
well i was beaten often ;_;
There's mean and there's honest, that was the latter.
Hahah
:D
i was blamed for lots of stuff i didnt do
i stole from men, and made them happy for it
08,01actually, just before that, when i still had a flat, i was so poor that i was literally living day to day with my only money for food being what i could make from busking with my cello
who doesnt want to get pilfered by a feral starving girl?
"don't be mean Meanwhile "? that's an oxymoron
winter is coming
i wonder what would happen if i was really an orphan o.O
08,01Rose`Bed: if only i had your sex appeal
Meanwhile: huyrry up and end your pathetic existance
i felt like one though
08,01i'd have become a prostitute
IM Mean
psh
prostitution is below me.
<--- Queen vs Abbedissa
:D
A *cute* feral starving girl
08,01in fact, i was very close to becoming a male escort once
How much more "feck you" can it be
If prostitution is below anyone I don't think it's you.
with my sex appeal, you would become a seductress, its like a prostitute, but more long term with a client
like a gold digger, or a black widow
lol
Cherchez la femme~
08,01AdamTheDuck: yeah; i would have done it too, if circumstances hadn't forced me out of the city i was living in
/me 08,01has absolutely no qualms about it
/me she got paid for midding some chats on chatango
08,01it's fun and good money
05but srsly
the heck? it cut words out
/me wishes she got paid for modding on chatango chats
05i get disgusted hearing about peopel that cant have a safe haven they can call home
I'll avoid it if at *all* possible. Being both trans and a prostitute doesn't sound too safe.
08,01Wrek: it wasn't so bad actually; it was summer, so i didn't freeze
i lived in a shut down warehouse for half a year
europe wasnt good to me
dont say the titanic song again :<
Wrek: Same here
are we friends, wrek?
08,01Rose`Bed: come over to scotland at some point; we can get hilariously drunk and poke the pondlife
I let ANYONE I know into my house
:D
No matter how little I know them
05even you Rose`Bed
youre the best wrek! when i rule the world, you can be an earl
08,01Wrek: aye; luckily, i had friends of a similar opinion, so i sometimes managed to actually have a bed
Rose`Bed: Earl of Sandvich? :D
08,01actually, that's how a really stupid relationship with my best friend started
08,01my god, that was such a bad idea...
08,01she offered me a bed for the night
08,01unfortunately, this bed was her bed
Gold_Demona: be my vice president? xD
muffins and sea ponies!
o,o
08,01and she's the female version of me, but with possibly *more* libido
aniderp|bestcakeever: Yesh! :D
08,01we were both in vulnerable place then, so we just went for it
o,o - wingdoomed face
....
08,01Vordox: i'm bisexual
WHAT?!
That's CHEATING
08,01ha
say WHAT
Hahaha XD
That's cheatin!
Vordox, oh you :$
08,01lulz
that's having your cake and eating it too
100% of the world is yours to choose from
:(
08,01Vordox: well, in reality, i only get 10% more choice
<.<
Err I don't
Since it's you, those will be included.
08,01good, neither do i
As will the recently deceased.
i never saw mature mans dick >_>
you'd only be 100% if you were Everysexual
The not so recently deceased.
And trees.
08,01gdlk_ouo: this implies that you see children's dicks
oh dear..
gdlk_ouo >_> neither did i
08,01Vordox: various reasons; primarily that my male best friend was her fuck buddy
honestly >_>
I have! =D
08,01but there was a positive that came out of it
08,01she realised that she was in love with him
bi/pan best sexual
08,01they're now engaged!
....
Yay!
What a odd consequence
08,01and i'm gonna be their best man
oh sweet
Daww :>
LAwlSat :D
Mention doing her in the best man's speech.
That'll go down splendid.
08,01Meanwhile: we do not speak of that. ever.
08,01the three of us, never.
pan sexuals in the house!
will you have to throw both bachelor parties ?
08,01pansexuals in the house, eyeing up the crockery
Lawl TrixieMuffin
05good question
raise raise raise your pansexual hoofs! (\
05if a male gay couple marry
o/
/)
05do you hold 2 separate bachelor parties?
08,01Wrek: i guess
wait
(\ /)
Perhaps you hold one and then hold it again for the other one.
about 2 lesbian woman getting married then what?
05do you have 2 best men?
08,01probably
2 bridal shower things?
<--- They forgot the arrow ambush
08,01aniderp|bestcakeever: since neither is the bride, i'm guessing not
/)6_9(\
it would be awkward to have both bridal showers at the same strip club
2 lesbians getting married no birdal shower? D:
08,01gay weddings are great, in that there are no established customs
ARMUND!
08,01oh wait, yeah, women exist too
/me 08,01sometimes forgets
man no
well then i probly wont have a bridal shower D:
Love is in bloom , a beautifull groom , a handsome groom.....
>neither is the bride
stoppit
Get to Armund
08,01Rose`Bed: I'M KIDDING :p
QUICK
Is just me, or something homosexual in air here?
ARMUUUND!
;_;
2 bridal shower? or just 1 big one?
:D
08,01gdlk_ouo: as i said, all the homo
05also DNA proves all humans origin from africa, which is good news since it means racist peopel can retire.
oh wait
:'(
crap
that's better
2 brides 1 shower
yeup >_>
Wrek: Dude. Check Everything is a remix
I am going to be a bride dammit >.<

also, i love pick up pup
08,01which he only told me in the morning
lol :D
08,01was a pity; he was really sweet
Too bad he turned out to be a tool.
08,01no no, he was austrian
08,01you're thinking of poland
O u immigrants.
08,01Meanwhile: i'll have you know, i'm a native
You're Indian.
08,01i'm bloody well scottish
08,01my mum's indian
08,01i'm the only brown person i know who has freckles

i did that once
ONCE!
08,01Wrek: you've never seen me in a kilt ;)
Braveheart would be terrible at tech support.
YOU CAN TAKE MY LINE, BUT YOU CAN NEVER TAKE MY DIAL UUUUUUUUUUUP.

Wrek: What about the sheep? :P

08,01it's so inaccurate
annnnnnnd now I partake in slumber
Hush, that's exactly what happened.
Meanwhile: :D

08,01Wrek: aye
05well duh

Goodngiht BronyState. :P
05i always forget his name
The Battle of Stirling Bridge-less.
08,01oh... yeah... what's his name... named after a computer...
08,01Mel Gibson
05ah yes
Wrek: May I request ONE single video?

05then im napping
wrek, can i give your girlfriend one hug? as a friend.
05twilies complainin
platonically!
Are you playing the NC vid again?
05Rose`Bed: i think she'd avoid you liek the plague
08,01actually, The Gibson (from the film Hackers) is a reference to William Gibson, author of Neuromancer, the book that (arguably) started the cuyberpunk genre
aww ._.
NC...AS in Nostalgia Critic?
movie+
*
NC as in New Conglomerate.
oh
Sign up today get a free t-shirt.
:D
I saw NC
08,01Wrek: can i give your girlfriend a sexy hug?
is it wrong to be ready to be both parties rebound in a friends relationship? because there is this one girl i really wanna get with, but her boy is a captain.
05i like that movie
and immediately though NCR
05hackers that is
FREE!
followed by New California Republic
05she's free to hug whomever she likes
Because apparently groping people's other halves is ok if you ask first.
08,01Rose`Bed: no, it's fune
08,01Rose`Bed: HUG PARTY! \o/
\o/~
08,01fuck yeah, sparkle sparkle sparkle
tink and twinkle
bronystate, i have a confession

08,01i should be studying...
08,01instead, i'm on IRC and noodling on my bass guiatar
LYRA! MWAHAHAH
lyra!
Implying that wasn't common knowledge.
/me takes Lyra` to bed
Oh hey, I was right.

/me gets days of our lives dramatic
08,01hoi, boy, what about me?
08,01Lyra`: i have an evil twin!
STOLEN! i've been STOLEN! R2D2 WHERE ARE YOU!'¡?
08,01actually, i suspect i'm the evil twin
Probably.
wouldnt doubt it
the thing is Meanwhile has no good half
anyway, im going to grab brekkie
be back in about half an hour babe
08,01my twin has a girlfriend
08,01i hate her
08,01absolutely despise her
Is she nice polite and well adjusted in society?
electric six!
08,01which is odd, because generally, i don't hate people
Because that seems like the type of person you'd hate.
08,01Meanwhile: more orless... slightly more less
Is ''End of days'' in the list'?
08,01it's more that she's taking my brother away from me, i guess
moral question bronystate! is it moraly wrong to use someones insecurites agaisnt them, even if youre helping them with something?
/me 08,01is a bit posessive
05its named jam it in the hole
08,01Lyra`: no
The ends justify the means.
oh good.
i wasnt sure if i needed to act ashamed
or rather, abashed
Meanwhile: kill yourself

morals are your personal standards
and ethics is how other people judge you for the way you act
08,01Wrek: morality is more dependent on beliefs; ethics are more dependant on philosphy
Ironic that the two most lacking in both of those have the answers.

/me 08,01is very unfocussed today
...........
08,01i think i'll make coffee, that might help
Oh u older versions of fairy tales
You mean original versions, Surge of the Mad.
AttackWithHugs: aye
Dat Nokia
08,01i actually grew up with the original, gory versions of most fairy tales
08,01becaues those versions preserve the morals of the stories
Scootaloo?
And the wicked stepsisters got their eyes gouged out by doves at Cinderella's wedding
08,01and the prince orginally had to stick his foot in her "fur slipper"
And Esmeralda got hanged by Frollo and Quasimodo dies next to her
After they cut off pieces of their feet to fit in the crystal shoe
AttackWithHugs: Victor Hugo was terrible at happy endings
/me takes MadSurge away into megas
Bronysith: WOOHOO GIANT ROBOT
Leave it up to Disney to preserve our childhoods till we can get our hands on the original
lol
AttackWithHugs: THEN
THEN
Childhood ruined moments
like Hunchback of notre dame, though good...god it is not good for children
AttackWithHugs: like, Les Miserables had the happiest ending he ever wrote and tons of people still died
I still like Disney movies, even if the stories are completely wrong. :P
ALL the ruined childhoods!

"30583 hours later"
We need to watch The Black Cauldron, the villain was terrifying
meh
black cauldron gets too much hate
The Black Cauldron was awesome
Yep
I should really get started drawing that picture for my friend.
I LOVE Gurgy
though it is single handedly the downfall of disney
disneys lowest moment
/me goes to find her sketch pad
Why? D:
they spent so much money on animation and so much on advertisements and hype it up to death
and critics destroyed it
Ah
Which is ironic because nobody remembers it
i remember watching it when i was sick
Critics, what do they know :D
looking back on it though, the hero is like shinji
all he does is WHINE
Critics are assholes
Yeah the hero wasn't very brave :D
he just whines
"i want to be a hero"
thats him in a nutshell
"I mustn't run away" :D
shinji is much more enjoyable than whoever the main character of black cauldron was
anyways
my fav disney movie is probably beauty and the beast
^
At least he and his group managed to defeat their villain, unlike Shinji :D
MadSurge: shinji did defeat the enemy
but the world ended
HAHAHAHA
lol oops
Bronysith: well, without destroying the earth then :D
Good job Shinji. You failed at saving humanity. :D
/me carries Bronysith to bed
well
AttackWithHugs: <3
Everyone is now Tang.
Shinji caused the end of humanity
not the world
though it could be looked at as either the end of humanity or a new beginning
A
AHAAHAHAHAHA
goddamnit gainax
Hey guys ^_^ xx
LOL Yeah, a new beginning as a giant puddle of Tang. :D
05nice song
Hey TwilightSonata!
MadSurge: Hi sweetie xx
:)
-emerges several hours later sleeping on Bronysith's back-
Hi TwilightSonata
>.>
<.<
pink elephants on parade
Hai AttackWithHugs ^_^
How you been lately? :)
I have to wonder
AttackWithHugs: why does my backside hurt now?
TwilightSonata: Pretty good.
what sort of shit Gainax will pull at the end of PSG S2
Engi: psg?
Bronysith: Dumbo <3
Awesome to hear ^-^
oh yea
goddamnit gainax
i hate you for evangelion
Bronysith: .......magic? *snort snort* Yeah, just assume magic.
yet i love you for gurren lagann
MARRY ME GAINAX
Oh, they did the same thing at the end of PSG
dunno why they love mindfuck endings so much
gurren lagann is easily my fav anime ever
and evangelion is right behind that
evangelion is good
but i love gurren lagann much more, for it is the exact definition of amazingly epic manliness orgasm causing mech battles AHDFIASDFJIPSDFJ
I generally don't like mindfuck endings. Especially if the series appears to make sense all the way up to that point.
Gold_Demona: I like silly mindfucks though
These endings that swoop in out of nowhere and you're left going "wtf just happened"?
EoE was just a huge mindfuck metaphor for masturbation
If the whole series is a mindfuck, then I don't mind so much, cuz a mindfuck ending would make sense then.
Gold_Demona: like when ALL the series doesn't make sense except for one character that says "wtf just happened"
Yeah
thats why i love gurren lagan
it sticks with what it was from beginning to end
But if you're able to follow a series, but then the ending throws you a complete curveball, that just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. =/
a kickass mech anime
Gold_Demona: Bobobobo Bobobo is funny for that :D
MadSurge: YES! I love Bobobo! :D
i dont know if i want to get into FLCL
yes you do
i havent been disapointed by gainax yet
watch FLCL
FLCL is ... interesting
all in one go
It's worth watching at least once
And it's only 6 episodes long
wait waht?
sounds like a dwarven forge
You *must* watch it at least once
just saying
Also FLCL features human Pinkie Pie :D
"Human" is stretching it
you mean pinkie pie?
It won me over cuz it makes references to Lupin. :>
YESH
doesnt it also have south park animation at some point?
I don't remember... I don't think so
I just know it's a REALLY random ride that throws you all over the place, but for some reason, you're enjoying the ride. :D
so a mindfuck roller coaster?
like a super fast roller coaster and at the end you go "...what just happened?"
Exactly
Question: when was this concert?
It does have a comic strip format at one point :D
05cant recall
05wastn too logn ago sicne i remember the commercials on TV for the tour
lol, yeah I was going to mention that the animation goes all over the place, including some parts where it looks like they just took pages from the manga and pasted it into the screen. XD

What is the big 3 of Gainax?

03 Heya, yeppers, I just came from a final exam
/me hugs Bronysith back
SlurryMoon: im about to go to a final exam, i require your brains
/me pulls out a straw
Final exams, the bane of existence.
Hey Seb, thought you were gonezo.
Hello SlurryMoon! How did it go?
03 nah, I've just been busy with college and all
dem blue gusy
03 Oh it went fine, I already calculated that even if I didn't take the final, I'd still have an A in the class
/me sucks SlurryMoon s brain out of the straw
05SlurryMoon: enjoy soem blue man group on stream
NOW I WILL ACE THOSE FINALS
03 :3
SlurryMoon: Long time no see. How are things?
03 to town*
SlurryMoon: i totally will return the brain to you after finals
The last final exam I had was for Comp II
03 Bearing*

03 sure I guess

05now kiss.
03 Oh AttackWithHugs, this exam I just took was for Muzik
/me blushes and kisses AttackWithHugs
03 ...
Wrek: Some PS2? :P
03 anyway, yeah
Hai Slurry

SlurryMoon: Muzik? Oooh did you pass?
<-- is this Eiffel 62?
SO HAPPY :D
HavokPhone: Oh right, that's today!
whip it
I completely forgot.
Crazy TRAIN
03 um, yes, I just said that I have an A with or without the final. I don't know why I even went to take it... other than just to be sure on my calculations.
Oh it's those blue guys
SlurryMoon is new mod?
:3
Thats pretty good.
SlurryMoon: but if you get a C on the final it brings your A to an F
Havok: nope, old one that was absent for a while
Oh
Slurry is one of the oldest. :D
03 actually, no. If I even make a Zero on the final.. I'd have like a 90.7 in the class
Neat :D
<--- What the f'ck is this? :D
SlurryMoon: not after i rig the grading system
Blue Man group
SlurryMoon: too bad you weren't here to enjoy ponies, but a good score is what matters now :) welcome back!
/me carries SlurryMoon to bed
03 Wow I haven't been to BronyState in a while... Celestia Radio and Everypony Radio are with us now it seems... and I see Ustream here. We never used to have a Ustream here.
howdy SlurryMoon
05SlurryMoon: dont forget the watermarks
03 yesh I see those, too
SlurryMoon: Welcome back =3
03 everything looks tons more professional
i laughed pretty hard
I wonder, about mods, when was SilverScreen coming back?
read the whole thing

TL; d
SlurryMoon: Most likely updating this LightIrc as well soon. :D
TL; DR
We have Ustream Seb because the other ones sucked or got hijacked. Which was quite amusing.

03 Oh right, I used to play the Walking Dead game here. Maybe I should continue soon.
:D

MadSurge: No wai

According to HotTopic she is

03 I think Ditzy would fit her better for an actual name in the show. You know... I don't recall even seeing Derpy yet in Season 3
Has she appeared in any of the episodes?
yes
i think there was a vrief moment in one of the eps
*brief
Disregard hot topic

And my phone's broken so I can't text anyone.

I have two Dreamcast systems. Both broken.
Thanks sanic.
Both of my Playstations are broken. :D
Last game I played on it was Monster Rancher 2, if I recall.
That is funny, considering that mine has some moving part loose and still works.
Meanwhile: Yeah, EQD is not a place of quality :D
The Dreamcast, deader than corduroy flares.

Disco doesn't die.
Deader than DC power.

Perhaps you should be learning math instead of being on chat.
i am already done with my math. i did the ones i could do.
Now do the ones you can't do.
Doing math is better than doing meth.
So get to it.
sonicdude558: i can try to help if you want
sonicdude558: as long as its not a test, cuz then cheating
it is not a test
no no. We have to let him go out into it alone, and face the wild math beasts. Its the only way we will know he is ready.

er twelve what?
13it's 12/12/12
Congrats, you have a calendar.
wow
ah right my birthday tormorow Shizuka
13no i have a reddit
true
If it has the date it's a calendar.
Shizuka: nothing like 10/10/10 though :3
13it doesn't, it has reposts of facebook reposts about twelve
So it has an unorthodox calendar.
13it is therefore superior to your archaic technology
If it tells me the date without having to deal with facebook I'd say it's superior.
say if i wanted to get a new pc,what kind would be good? heard Dell and Sony are good but wanna look around abit :$
'Sony'
LOL
HOLY NOSTALGIA BATMAN
sense not shizuka stream
Shizustream! <3
Building stuff I see
Hey guys. Who's streaming? Wrek?
Oh wait, no, it's Shizuka.
:P
Yay for morning Shizustreams!
:)
Shizu's all: Open close open close
yay Shizustream!
Does anybody know what Shizu looks like IRL?
Nope
:I
It's a secret :3
But I wanna know what she looks liiiiike. :(
Tough cookie :I
:(
I don't like tough cookies.
I prefer them soft and chewy.
J_E_Smith71: That is an insult to best pony.
Well, second best.
Best is Fluttershy.
:3
and Rainbow Dash.
Dashie is third best when she's not being an asshole.
thats why i like her.
Because she's an asshole?
that and other reasons
Wow, then you must LOVE Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon.
fuck no
http://imgur.com/gallery/ZRq4N
oh stream
but i do like to read silver spoon and sweetie belle shipfics.
Barbetos|AtSanic: :D dat Bat Bitchslap
CTHULHU: Why not. They're even bigger assholes that Rainbow Dash, so you must love them, right?
Wait, Silver Spoon x Sweetie Belle? That's an odd toy ship...
there not asshols there just bullies
I don't really like pairing up the Drusaders with anyone anyways.
*Crusaders
Unless it's with Spike. I openly ship SweetieSpike and SpikeBloom.
theres a difference
ESPECIALLY SweetieSpike. Sweetie Belle is the most adorable thing EVER.
Next to Fluttershy.
i agree
Hi, Kandahiru
But do you know who is cuter than Fluttershy?
nice hut
Shizu. :P
now i have this urge to minecraft
My sister has Minecraft on her netbook.
hey again. just wanted to say hi. gotta get back to team sports
gotta be a quite decent netbook
>Never seen someone before
minecraft sint exactly friendly to rescources
>Feel qualified t ocomment on their appearance.
That's a nice house.
Nice logic.
esepcially not with tekkit
NO, THE SHIZUSTREAM!!
and suddenly screensaver
IT IS GOOOOOONE!
Shizuka, the stream broke!
meh.
Meanwhile: Oh, shut up.
hai
Ohai Chrysalis :)
Shizu ACTS cute. That's enough for me.
hey Chrysalis
And she has a cute voice, too.
You've never heard her voice...
shizu has never spoken once
ROFL.
What a slimeball.
also, dat frontpage
Really? I would have sworn she had a a few points...

Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Discussion: Favorite Refence so Far?
oooh minecraft
FTB?
"refence"
seriously, EQD
13hm
discuss redone fences? what?
13have to take care of something for a bit
Shizuka, Meanwhile is being mean to me. :(
Quit being a kiss ass you twat.
13you get used to him
^
13or you just /ignore
i get used to it too
no need to ignore
same
ignoring is easier though
Whatever's going to be seen the weekend after this, I won't be around for it. I'll be on the road all day on that day, and I probably won't get to the hotel until after BMN starts. My hotel has a terribad internet connection that probably won't be enough to handle the stream.
Kandarihu: where are you going?
Dark92Enigma-, Detroit.
Kandarihu: Damn, that'll suck. If any of my movies get chosen, you'll be missing some fantastic Japanese movies.
oh
wuhay ftb pack
Keyword being 'If'
And CTHULHU, I was joking around. I thought THAT was obvious.
Shitty joke bro.
and im just being an asshole
alexxm: My A-movie choice was live-action Space Battleship Yamato and by B-movie choice was Karate-Robo Zaborgar.
its what i do
Meanwhile: Seriously, dude, quit. I've moved on, you should too. And I wasn't being a slimy kissass. I was just being goofy.
no you were being a slimy kissass that much is true
Plus, why can't I call someone cute from the way they act?
Goofy in a way that screams "I long for the acknowledgement of my peers but don't know how to do so."
Girls do that all the time and they don't get shit like this.
you know
meanwhile would be the best hater ever
takes apart a fandom from the inside
no girls get called whores when they do that all the time
Chrysalis: Who says he isn't one already?
Well, my jig is up.
can ya'll drop it its getting boring?
play a new song then Meanwhile
CTHULHU: I agree.
i find this very amusing
it was
Sorry, I checked, all I've got is Disgust of the Masses, Hatred For Scum, Why Won't You Stop Talking, and A One Way Ticket To I-Hate-Youville.
I get enough shit from dicks like you in real life. I don't need it on the internet, too.
still is
Welcome to the internet you twat.
Jmo: hi
The fuck?!
Jmo: no reason to be a dick dude.
Not true Chrysalis, we're assholes to slime.
^
no, your assholes to everyone
you're*
cause you think everyone is slime
you're* And I'm not an asshole to you.
Chrysalis: I dunno, they seem to be focusing quite expressly on me.
Meanwhile no because i'm not new
No because you're not a twonk.
really a twonk?
Hello Everypony !
what is it, the 1950's again
Hi, Cloudrunner.
you too afraid to say naughty words?
Ohai Cloudrunner :)
gotta circulate the slang
how are things Cloudrunner
If you want me to say "you're not a fucking asshole" instead then sure, I just happen to like the word "twonk"
SpeccyRush true, it can get quite old, but twonk went out of style a long time ago
everything is fine and you ?
Oh wow, this is gonna turn into a hate war quick. I'm just gonna bow out for a few hours until you people STOP BEING SUCH GODDAMN IDIOTS.
no u
The irony of hearing you say that.
well then it's about time that it came back in style Chrysalis
:D
Sylandest: Oh you~ :D
:3
Takes a bit of effort to clean the gutters but it's worth it.
You know what, I'm just gonna stay here.
come on, it sounds like the sort of sound effect you would apply to snapping a fat womans bra
hm sweet house :§
Good for you.
what happin to love and tolerate, really.
Because I wanna see what other half-hearted insults Meanwhile can throw out.
Chrysalis: That actually makes sense, when I imagine it
cannot be unseen as well
Anybody have popcorn. I bet this'll be good.
everytime you hear twonk
you'll think of snapping a bra
To be honest I use the word twonk quite abit, I picked it up from an idiot abroad :P
SpeccyRush: Oh please, this is NOTHING.
Eh, twonk is still one of my favourite words.
'until you people STOP BEING SUCH GODDAMN IDIOTS.'
Yeah, I'm real sure.
Bloody twat.
Jmo: HI
Hello to you too wipergone2.
Just over here, eatin' popcorn. *nomnomnom*

golems are damn cute
So, like I was trying to say earlier, who voted for the movie night?
You know, next week's movie night.
whats the movie
there's this thing called the front page
Next week's movie hasn't been chosen yet.
Voting was opened for next week's movie today.
In case anybody missed it, my A-movie choice was Space Battleship Yamato, and my B-movie choice was Karate-Robo Zaborgar.
What were your choices?
If i tell you it wont come true ^_^
None of your business for A, My Secret for B
o cool more minecraft
good evening y'all
howdy ekips
lololol
Hi, ekips.
Ohai ekips :)
hay lo ekips
Any admins online I can talk about regarding a private stream?
Yay stream :3
private?
hi ekips ^_^
ekips: Shizustreams are best streams.
There's pooling around your feet.
xD
Yeah for the next big Dutch Meetup (150+ ppl). We've had private streams before from BS.
Meanwhile: You're still here?
Why would he leave? :P
No, you just wish I was here so you're projecting this image of me into existence.
those lighting bugs...
Just wondering if someone in charge is online atm
they keep "fixing" them
Meanwhile: Why would I wish to be bitched at by a twelve-year old loser with too much time on his hands?
you'd need to put a light source above the half slabs to negate that glitch Shizuka
13can't
13that's the roof
oh well
First off, I'm 20 tommorrow. Second, there's a grand irony in being called a loser with too much time on his hands by someone with nothing better to do than slobber over women in chatrooms.
13Meanwhile: Enough.
Shizuka: THANK YOU.
no ceep going.
The truth is too much for some people.
and?
Jmo: A ha. A ha. No.
hello
I'm just tired of getting hated on everywhere I turn.

Shizuka: You gonna be streaming any anime today?
Shizuka its going to be awesome when it does get released
theres so much new stuff
hi

Hey
Sketch_Toku_Brony neither, make your own
http://www.amazon.com/Apple-30-inch-Flat-Panel-Display-M9179LL/dp/B0002ILKWM
Im going to put it next to my other one.
Chrysalis: Thanks. At least I know someone here knows when to drop something.
sorry, I understand a little the english
The first one I got of craigslist was $275, the one I got today was $400
still smoking deals.
The funny thing is by saying that you've noted you're not dropping anything.
Chrysalis: what do ya recommend partwise?
wow thats cheap
depends on your price tag
Meanwhile: Oh boy, here we go.
I just need one more so I have 3.
Not going anywhere, just saying.
Chrysalis: well i may be getting 500$ this Feb. so lets say thats my budget
haha
not built a computer on a budget that small in a while...
what are you after use wise?

ew uncharted
eyup
same reaction
Chrysalis: hmm i suppose gaming but mostly being able to play hd vids w/o lag for now
gaming on $500?
youngsters these days
well on a budget that low, go for an AMD cpu
intel arnt worht the price hike at those margins
actually, 500 isnt low budget
For a gaming machine it is
not really
French is your first language, right Hypercynder?
secret: buy parts seperate
mine cost me quadruple that
building from components
then you got robbed
oui!
I'm gonna test something. Hey, Meanwhile, Jmo, you still here?!
no, i built for games
What do you want?
yes
Perhaps you should take your own advice and drop it.
how to locked a website ?
2 things to take care of when building a pc
its not worth skimping out and buying a cheap PSU
Well, either they left, or the ignore function is working! :)
Did it now.
Oh hell
weakling
and spending a bit more on a case early will save you in the long term
Shizuka diamonds not that impressive in creative :P
Depending on his client, it could of been a name ignore or IP listing.
i'm upgrading my ram and processore the next few days. new mainboard, i5 with 3,2 each and 8 gbn ram only cost around 300
Chrysalis: i see thanks :)
I'm going with latter.
componants arent that expensive
for most games it isnt worth going for the more cores
Well, props for actually having the brains to use it.
clock cycles are more important
when you can't take the heat , do the wuss out
No clue
^
Shizuka there is a transition rail you have to use
wait, elevator rails
I'm not sure what that means
didnt he patch it so you can basically just run into them when powered

you want to delete your website?
if your heart is set on intel
AAAAAH
Chrysalis: its not
go for an i5 (or an i3 if funds are tight)
Chrysalis: i'm curious. could you post a list of your hardware?
for games the pentium is just gonna slow it down
If you own it, couldn't you just give up the ownership of the url or however it works
"we could kill everyone else except him as punishment"
Just delete all your content and wait for the domain to expire
fanfic break, bbl.
If it's someone else's website then obviously you can't delete it :P
antec 1kw psu, xfx 7870, amd bulldozer (4.2GHzx4core)
Chrysalis: and the other parts?
Getting a bit drowsy. Wonder if I should take a nap or just get some coffee...
no , a deleted this website : http://xlnation.net/
SSD hdds
oups
Shizuka: That's a mod?
Chrysalis: i5 3470. 3.2 gig, can boost to 3.6. should be way enough for most games. only 165

how is everyone doing?
Dark_Horst of course yes, but he was after a pentium
ok
Ohai Bronysith :)
games now would run slower cause its missing chip features
/me flies off from Brosysith's impact. "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!"

ie some of the newer onchip vector functions which games use for physics
*Bronysith's
Fucking caps lock.
ohai Bronysith
xlnation.net is not my website
its not your website so you cannot delete it.
ok
Shizuka: Try the Screw cutoff for your tracks atthe bottom?
rule of thumb: if you want agming, you'll need an intel core quad
you have no authority.
anyone elses stream frozen?
wat
Watching somebody play Minecraft is so relaxing.
a) most games are still at most dual core
yeah, stream down
ack
and only at the top end do you really see a difference between the intels and the amds
I think I must have just not understood his question
13restarted
13don't know why ustream sucks today
Dammit, Bronysith, your explosion made the stream crash!
hi everyone :)
howdy Lil_B!
Everyone should know you can't just go and delete someone else's website
finally, after 2 weeks, I have the Internets again!
Heya Lil_B! :)
welcome back :3
Hi, Lil_B.
Lil_B: the internets welcomes you back
hi Lil_B ^_^
Horsie!
thanks Sylandest MLP_Brovakiin AppleBloom and BladedWings :)
There have been lots of non-native English speakers here lately...
Chrysalis: dunno a bout that. there's a pcgaming magazine i'm reading (yes, neutral guys) and in every test i've read so far, the AMDs brought less power than intel cores
they test quite thoroughly
Sylandest you wanted to tell me something?
really, can you get a 4.2ghz stock intel?
PC minecraft is so much different compared 360
lol another post from the facebook group...
GODAMMIT HELP
Lil_B: yes!
I WAS EATING SCOOTALOO WINGS WITH HOT SAUCE ON THEM
AND I KNOW I CAN'T HANDLE SPICY SHIT
BUT I ATE IT ANYWAYS
AND NOW MY MOUTH IS ON FIRE
WHAT DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
AAAAA
compared to*
Lil_B: I have a proposition for a project for you~
well, it should be
Trance music + Minecraft = Perfect gaming stream. This is why Shizustreams are best streams.
o_o wtf
Lil_B! :$ did you fix your computer?
Someone needs to turn their capslock off
drink milk
quick what kind of grade is 203/250?
*internet
Bronysith: 80% or so
Shizuka: are those crystals or a new type of plant?
probably part of her mod
she has a very extensive mod kit
yeah I know it's part of a mod
i know it has something to do with tekkit
its not in tekkit
so what parts would you recommend Chrysalis and Dark_Horst ? if ya can list them individually *HD=this,Modem= that* that would help lol kind of a pc noob :D
I have a lot of expierence with tekkit!
MadSurge nope, the Problem was "ok Provider, we move from this house, to this house, we don't want to change the contract, just want you to shift it from this house to this house" , Proveiser:"Understood!" , and goes on to cut off Internet :/
Gonna go make some coffee. Be back in a few minutes.
13wtf
Shizuka: Eeeyup
its most certainly NOT tekkit
Check settings for ustream itself?
streaming minecraft? thats a paddlin
a) tekkit is illegal
13never changed
shiz is breaking the interwebs :P
b) this is ftb
c) ftb is legal
Lil_B: so did you fix that now?
Chrysalis: nothing to do with anything XD
Guess Ustream got bored.
MadSurge if you can read this, than I think so :P
i really hate tekkit :P
I gathered
Chrysalis: tekkit?
it is the dick move of modpacks
Lil_B: did you watch the episodes you missed? :D
Vordox I roughly finiushed the running Animation while I had no Internet :D 12 Frames
AppleBloom: ME :$
I personally support FTB also, but I used to play a tekkit server alot so I know all the mods in it etc.
Chrysalis: how so?
Lil_B: Awesome! Mind I see? =3
i'd go for an i5 processor. 3.2GH is a good value for middle class PCs. 8gb ram should be minimum, ddr3 kits are dead cheap right now. the kingston hyperx 8gb one costs 35 (euros). for a graphics card i'd say something out of the geforce 500 series, 560 perhaps (i should note that i never tried something else than geforece, not much of an expert there)
Ouch
Vordox COURSE!
Sketch_Toku_Brony: when you buy procerssor, mainboard and CPU fan, you have to pay attentiuon to the socket. very important. the 1155 socket is very widespread
sweet, i got a B in my math final
EVERYONES DIEING
the asrock Z77 pro3 has 4 ddr4 slots and thaqt socket. costs 85 euros. it's what i'll have delivered the next few day
s
Sketch_Toku_Brony: The makers of Tekkit don't have premission the use some of the mods they include in it so people get bad at that basically
Dark_Horst at this sort of level he shouldnt be buying a CPU fan seperate from the cpu
mad*
you only really need that when you push the top end chips
Chrysalis: course. did that too
the nermax t40 tb fan got good reviews. also 1155 socket
*enermax
/me glompels Chrysalis in celebration
/me dodges
wow, ive been playing the xbox vesion to long, look at all of this new stuff
/me boomerangs
Chrysalis: made the experience that the stock fans intel delivers with their cpus are usually too weak. either that or loud
Yeah with the intels, not with the AMDs though
Rainfall_Night: the Xbox version is literally years behind the PC version, what your watching right now is the PC version that is also heavily modded with Feed The Beast mod pack
my case fans are louder
i dont mind paying a little extra for the fan though , to have the increased performace. but again, jsut my experience
i buy hardware after test tables
yeah, but are you really going to recommend overclocking on hardware that in total is under $500
the board is gonna burn out
jcelios: its just that my computer is old and slow and it is alot more convinet to play xbox, which they need to update
never have decent North/South bridge sinks
Rainfall_Night: play whatever you want I'm just informing :)
Chrysalis: i have an arctic cooling fan. not expensive and very silent
welp
time to check out FLCL
yeah i got the stock cpu fan, but 7 case fans moving air through the case
Stream down again?
i rmember the day i swithced on my tower for the first time
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37gZjFrFRaw&list=FLAViXIrbp86kg5lvVfFdQuQ&feature=mh_lolz
YOINK!
LET THE SCOOT DRUMMO BEGINNO!
i had to double check if it was on becasue i didnt hear the fans at frst
jcelios: well i need a new computer, im temped to blow 1000 bucks on a gaming computer
that was awesome
Chrysalis: sure you need that many?
Dark_Horst theyre all PWM controlled by a dedicated controller
they only really spin up when i play games
*sip* YYYEEEEOOOOOWW!! THAT is some good coffee!
And then Comcast screws up like it does every day
So I guess that's it
one day maybe i should buy a more expensive case though
mine costed 20 bucks
Hope ponies enjoyed while it lasted
aaaaaw, well thanks for the minecrafte Shizuka ^_^
Is shizumobile the same as Shizuka?
Dark_Horst: is that Enermax t40 tb fan an arctic fan?
thanks for the stream Shizuka
Okay, just checking.
also only has one slot for an exit fan
Thanks for the stream, Shizuka.
Sketch_Toku_Brony: dont think so
Thanks for the stream Shizuka :)
new pet hate, setting up a project to be built for both linux and windows
Dark_Horst: ah i see well is it a good fan?
i could use some hayfries about now
i could use some real fries
Sketch_Toku_Brony: test says so. silent and efficient. i can tell you more friday, i expect it to be delivered then^^
http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/456/249/b99.png
Dark_Horst: cool thanks :) got all the parts written down
"who was your favourite president?" "benjamin franklin" *headesk*

hey
Giftcards are the worst gifts, just remember that.
Dark_Horst: know any good places that sell those parts? Bestbuy,amazon,ect.?
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Discussion: Favorite Refence so Far?
Sketch_Toku_Brony: no idea. i ordered at alternate, but that's a german site
awww
seriously? why would you think that?
Dari did that last night too lol
i thought theyd stopped the linking
cause they had spoilers in
Sketch_Toku_Brony: look around, se whats cheaper
Dark_Horst: ah i see,im in US but thanks anyway :)
never buy componants second hand though
NEVER
I think I will buy my sister giftcards because she loves shopping
But for everyone else I'm trying to avoid it
cyborg
ah
Dark_Horst: so buy them new? got it
he just has a script
I would choose a gift card if I can't figure out what they might like
but he does talk in here
I'm looking at little cell phone gadgets for my dad
But everything I'm finding is too expensive or not very useful
Sketch_Toku_Brony: yeah, if they've been in use for a while, they are more prone to malfuntion
gift cards suck because they lock you to a single store.
had my same mainboard for over two years now. but last week, it broke
Give cash instead of gift cards.
Dark_Horst: good to know :)
and dont give Visa or Mastercard prepaid gift cards because they have stupid fees.
I got a $50 gift card once from my godfather that could be used at any store in the mall
that was pretty awesome
It was a while ago, but I think I spend most of it at gamestop...
I dont remember the last time I bought a game at a store.
did I ever link you that ultimate pokemon hack ?
Why didn't I think of this? http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/455/981/8e5.jpg
helloooooooooooooooo
that one where they used the inventory to program the gameboy?
Hi, artist
yeah
ohai artist ^_^
yeah, that was awesome
Hai artist :)
pretty crazy
its a nice day to be alive
with ponies at the end :P
Let the fun begin....
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAabtQZSdlE&list=FLAViXIrbp86kg5lvVfFdQuQ&index=3
haha, yeah
artist: I wonder about that sometimes, though.
I was telling my brother about it and he was like "oh, that's pretty cool"
then I said it played the MLP theme song at the end and he was like "UGH REALLY, PONIES??"
LOLOL
good song Vordox
artist: I know =3
pony rolled?
I pissed off a few friends yesterday
not completely seriously of course
If you have to wonder if it's a good day to be alive do the world a favour and introduce yourself to the bottom of a lake.
artist: Let's just say this -- be glad you weren't in the cat room 30 minute ago.
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Hasbro Combines Forces for Better TV to Toy Integration
I created a special email that crashes the iphone mail client
*chat room, not cat room.
yay cat room
awww
but before it crashes it says "ponies are awesome"
Though a cat room would be awesome.
indeed
so when you try to open the mail client, it just says, ponies are awesome, then crashes
And very soft and fluffy. :3
what was going on in the chat room 30 mins ago then? :o
I'm suddenly very glad I don't have an iphone
He was being a whiny bitch, so people called him a whiny bitch. He whined about it.
someone was being a kiss ass
artist: A bunch of idiots being stupid. Let's leave it at that.
I'll have to remember to be careful of your emails now :P
Crybaby.
hahahahahahaaa
who was whining?
I'm not 100% sure how it works though, I was playing around and found the bug by accident.
Vordox: y does this song make my ears warm?
artist: It's insane
Bronysith: I'd rather not point fingers...
Vordox: loving this song lol ^_^
POINT THEM DAMMIT!
Carnival Cat is an insane Pony with a twist of a senes of reality
Bronysith: because he'd be pointing them at himself.
Which causes ruptures of her existance
See her as... Cheshire Cat
You don't think that sounds more like a highjacker than a virus?
than a bug I mean
However, a very activate part instead, where she "has fun"
i like singing, singing is fun!
I its some kind of memory corruption possibly.
Good day, good day, how are we and all that jazz.
But Im not an ios expert so I don't know.
ohai ScootaChicken

Oh, well, ok then. Stalk someone else.

Shizuka: Still here? =3
But nah, basically, you appear to have shown more signs of intelligence than the majority if this chat.
hi BronyDex
13in and out
13comcast permitting
Shizuka: Oh
Which admittedly isn't hard, seeing as this channel has the combined IQ of a fruit fly with downs syndrome.
no idea, but there's probably a youtube video of it somewhere
Good morning aji :)
/me explodes ScootaChicken
Shizuka: Well I just wondered, if you could hear my plea for a request for a certain "song" To be played during the offline for a while? ^^
ScootaChicken: fr..fru...fruit fly?
actually, its night here in europe so IRONIC
As you can see, Bronysith just proved my point excellently.
13you would have to ask sumica
Woopdedoo, I'm honoured I can fit your definition of "smarter than a fruit fly with downs syndrome."
ScootaChicken: you're welcome
Zeogold: Glad to hear it.
Really? I recall your fire has been on embed within youtube during some offhours
such a waste..
I just walked in and what is this?
im smart.....kinda....
Or were you really there?

I've made bigger shits

Bronysith: Gtfo, now
Meanwhile: i find that hilarious, but im not good in the head, so its alright
Hence why he's an enormous cuntbag.
I've lost two cats so far. And honestly, I've liked the ones I lost more than the ones I still have.

Hi MLP_Brovakiin it's been a while.
MASF123: I know right, how have you been buddy? :)
...eh sort of here and there...
I started working recently.
I'm gonna leave for a little while. Got some stuff to do, and I'll be back in a couple of hours.
im eating 1 day old pizza, guess what it tastes like
Pj's with full sleeves that stops at mini skirt level
...diGoirno?
LOGIC
what is this, if I may ask?
yay
artist: Delicious
Something about chains, idk I was only looking at the fucking intro.
00,10PJ's with a chocker for that matter
Hoody|Skool: delicious isnt a taste
Sumica: what anime is this again?

MASF123: BY CR AND BSTATE
Whoo
When does Hugo Weaving show up and kick her ass?
Yeah. :)
Zeogold Hugo could not be bothered today. Check tomorrow.
Why the fuck am I even in here.
He's probably busy blowing up the houses of parliment or some shit.
Oh yeah, it was to shame Bronysith.
...I don't have a computer though. :'( So will miss it but I have a feeling someone will upload it to Youtube.
ScootaChicken_: You luff us?
Hoody|Skool: Fook right off m8.
Yuu inglesh baad
Ill fokkin drop u bruv.
ScootaChicken, not if you're shaming him for the sake of shaming him.
Oi, stalker chicken thing, don't start talking like a bigger twat.
Asstitties

Kandarihu: Shaming him because of the cat thing earlier, done my bit now more or less.

ScootaChicken is always a twat, Zeogold, so I doubt thats gonna stop.
TRANSLATIOn

Call Me = Change ME
00,10Funny thng is the translation is probably what they ment to say
That much is obvious RX-78-SweetieBot but he could at least talk proper fucking english like he's apparently capable.
Sumica: Such a twist
Zeogold: Are you mad? You seem mad
I'm sensing alot of anger
Engrish is the term.
Were you abused as a small teenager?
aaaand im back
00,10Time to brefriend the shit out of her
Mad like the fucking hatter. If the hatter were on ritalin.
Sumica: GOing all Touhou style?
Hoody|Skool: I was. :'(
Sorry, I live in South London.

So no, great experience
00,10This is that
Sumica: Ah, that paradise?

Your duty to sound like a jerkoff? Wouldn't surprise me, shithole that London is.
anime heaven= having a family
00,10The white hare chick is puting them there
It could be worse.
I could live in Bristol.
00,10the whitehare chick is the bock of darkness
Sumica: So if the White Haired evil girl is ded = break paradise?
i'm bored, i'm out. all i learned today, Bronysith <asshole, Zeogold <thinks hes smart, ScootaChicken_ <on period
True, Bristol is like Hulk Hogans bedpan.
That's a fucking terrifying mental image.

I'm glad the cripple got some insight as to what's going on because I'm fucking lost.

Dohohohoh if you know...
;)
Zeogold: Its one of those things you have to watch, but I wouldn't if I were you, you have to pay attention
It did not ever go there.
Hoody|Skool: I started reading that but then I got distracted.
Anyway, I'm going to fuck off now.

It apears I do not know the times
I did not realize it was even out.

Bronysith: The mashed potatoes
When man crawled out of a fucking cave and invented the wheel he also penned the Hobbit.
Hoody|Skool: use sour cream
So, man has been alive since the late 1800

Wasn't talking to you you fucking shitsack.

Did you know that you fart enough to fill a baloon?
Knowing is half the battle.
In a day*
Wow. I feel so much fucking smarter for knowing that.
:O Nanoha?
What kind of fucking battle are you having that requires you know that anyway? Some sort of really weird balloon blowing contest?
Polydunami: eeyup
Random male teammate
Hello? Not much to say?
seems so
guess not lol
i for one have no idea whats going on
storywise
There are some knights and a book of darkness and some other shit, I don't know.
Whoa, Fate is on Nanoha's side now?
what's an arc-en-ciel? did somebody mispell something?
00,02in orbit in outer sapce
Phase4: YOu caught that too? :D
As opposed to in orbit in the fucking fridge.
/me glomps the out of nowhere Phase4
makes sense
00,02Vordox, XD
/me 00,02hugs Bronysith back
Zeogold: orbit isnt outer-space, its orbit
How can it orbit space, when orbit is around a body of mass?
00,02Dark_Horst, you cant maintain an orbit within the atmosphere
It isn't? Well fuck, got schooled.
Phase4 yes you can, however you would need a constant supply of thrust
00,02Chrysalis, yeah, but then its hardly orbit
defines on your definition of orbit
technically its just going around an object
Hey guys. Got done with my other internet stuff faster than expected.
So is it in fucking space or not.
First things first, you have to throw yourself at the ground and miss.
Phase4: and there i thought they had a distance border
00,02" an orbit is the gravitationally curved path of an object around a point in space,"
00,02:P
"In space." Right, so it's in space.
Phase4: playing all those kerbals payed off
00,10it's falling at the ground and missing
Phase4 so as long as the thrust is always perpendicular to the earth,
00,02^ Sumica
Yaaay
Yes
to resist slowing due to friction
knew orbit was above athmosphere, but i assumed outer space was... more out. why else call it outer space?
00,02Chrysalis, but then the path isnt curved via gravity
skydiving is very risky, 1/5 people dont even make it to the ground
there a word you dont really need
<---wtf
00,10well they cant call it inner space, cause that was a bad movie
Nice use of Blitz of Gold for the bumer there.
*bumper
Sumica: how about just space?
00,02yeah, why do we say outer space
00,02nothing much thats outer about it
<--- WRONG SOUND VOICES
so she has the power of doing the laundry?
Because fucking NASA that's why.
Lol
00,10just dont close your eyes and listen to it Vordox
I really like Fate's costume :3

Can't wait until the DVD/BD of the Nanoha A's movie comes out. I'd LOVE to see what they've done to improve the story. Even though the story is awesome as it is.
Ohai Serenity :)

Rose`Sunlight: tentacoos for the win

00,02Sumica, why didnt they just use the hammer twice?
Rose`Sunlight: actually, he's a dog
or, wolf, i think
Throw all that in a fucking pot and you get anime.
00,02seems like that would have solved it nice and quick
Phase4, obv it has a cool down time
00,02Rose`Sunlight, oh yeah

oh, and nude elfs

/me yawns
Nanoha is way too fucking adorable.
Oh my...feel tied. :/
sooooo anyone give me a quick summary of what they were actually fighting?
tired.
This is just...
typical Shouo
Vordox: ikr
Shoujo*
I'm talking about the character
This isn't exactly Shoujo
This is Seinen.
Magical Girl Shoujo
:P
tf2?
oh hey, this a good one
00,02this is new
ohey not seen this one
MGLN is a Seinen franchise. Intended for adults.
Sumica! Seen the one with RD as drunk flier? :D
Yay, RD! :D
Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica.
MadSurge: You cannot tell me that freaking sharks with freaking laser beams attached to their freaking heads is not adorable?
Need I say more?
Fluttershy!
Vordox: It's true, though.
MASF123|TF2: they're not, but they're badass
:P
Like you'd know what's for adults, you're like fucking 13.
Dude
awesome
Calm down
Vordox: Neither is Japan's, I take it.
Zeogold: I'm one of the oldest here in general. :P
MORE NANOHA!!!
Vordox: for now

Who's talking to you douchenozzle?

Zeogold: why you so hostle?
I'm leaking nice out my nose.
Polydunami: true, but he's being sarcastic
00,10Hi R, pick a longer name please
Zeogold: YOu remind me of Karkat. :P
00,02Zeogold, yeah, well.... your mother
Who the fuck is Karkat.
Zeogold: You are him
what's nicer than the truth
That doesn't make any sense.
Your face.
<--- I*m sorry but this is FAR from Seinen
If you want REAL seinen...
I'm not quite to that part of Homestuck
Watch.....
00,02Zeogold, neither does calling someone a douchenozzle
Damnit I forgot the name
Otaku No Musume San
00,02Zeogold, so lets juse be friends :)

The fuck is juse. Is that like juice?

THAT fucks with your hands
You want BETTER SEINEN from the fricking top!?
Usagi Drop
I've read Bitter Virgin
Do NOT say this is seinen... ever =P
Freaking LOVE that opening theme.
lupin the 3rd
Polydunami: Woot? You okay? D:
Zeogold: he said "Lets just be friends"
I am lost. What is Seinen?
00,02Dark_Horst, yeah, only things that are less usable are onscreen phone keyboards
Should I know?
00,10She has the magic cancer
It was a few years ago
BladedWings: So I am getting any juice or not?
Zeogold: no, u get Karkat lol
Seinen means "for adult audiences"
Polydunami: You forgot the horrors I hope?
I can't remember the names, but I remember what happened
It's pretty hard not to
Sumica I dunno why but that reminded me of onigai teacher and "stand stills"
forget
Magic coma
Polydunami: That's why I say
S'fucking bullshit. I don't know what Karkat is and I don't get any juice.
That's TRUE Seinen, this is just "titled" Seinen for interest of other people
Zeogold: homestuck, that is all :D
Zeogold: YOu can get a bucket with your karkat you know
"I am no longer devouring her" "THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID"
BladedWings: wait, really?
:D
I don't want a fucking bucket I want my damn juice.
But you can fill the bucket with Juice
Fucking orange juice.
D:
Right, one thing. Nanoha first appeared in an adult visual novel.
but orange juice is best jucie ;3;
00,10that is a silly table

that's a weird table
thelonepony: yea lol he yells and cusses just about every other word lol
BladedWings: true
Fanservice!
lol
00,02recompile its programs?
Phase4: Too stupid
Phase4: Therefore, not Seinen :P
00,02must be in the matrix
Phase4 keeps a copy of its source code at all times
00,10they have spacetime magic ships Phase4, they dont have to make sence
Nanoha is NOT stupid. Shaddap.
dat dog just talk? :O
magic programs. becasue why not
00,02Sumica, excuses!
It's pretty fucking stupid.
BladedWings: i thinks its a wolf
whatever, it just talked lol
thelonepony: Dog, Wolf, Turtle Tortoise
okay :P
WHATEVER
00,10Sad girls in snow. What is this megatokyo?
you're watching anime and you find a talking wolf weird?
"You came" THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID

You're a fucking idiot.
Dark_Horst: not weird just caught off guard
Okay, I'm done with the "that's what she said" jokes
00,02Chrysalis, of course! that explains everything!
00,10the drier Polydunami
Sumica: I wonder.. What's your definition of Seinen?
You made 1, but good job on realising you're about as funny as old people falling down stairs.
Seinen is a demographic, guys. Not a genre.
You mean the dryer appliance?
00,10a 6 letter word starting with S Vordox
:P
shitty
Phase4 or if you want more of an in depth explanation http://ct.fra.bz/ol/fz/sw/i59/5/6/19/frabz-japan-62c48f.jpg

smokin
nope. fact
Zeogold: seriously, calm it down
00,10So ponies then Vordox?
BladedWings: I'm totally calm, I just say fucking a lot.
Sumica: Yes, really :P
I love how the Nanoha franchise mixes magic and science into such a cohesive whole. It's really impressive.
Created about...
25 years ago
Rune Magic Coding?
Vordox: Of course.
Yeah THOUGHT so... =P
Good
Welcome to 25 years ago

<-- Programs nowadays are common
hi
why have i never seen magic gauss weapons?
Back then it was a fricking mystery
dat hulk music :D
BladedWings: link the pictue now?
that shizu posted earlier?
Did you say Usagi Drop was a seinen production?
aniderp|bestcakeever: k hold up
Polydunami: One of the better ones, yes
It's kinda fun putting people on ignore. When they start a shitstorm, you only see one half of the conflict!
Because it's kind of not seinen :S
wait that was the fav.me thingy?
That's why I said to Sumica before "Yes, really"
aniderp|bestcakeever: i think?
Keep up with the convo Polydunami :P
more anime?!?!
No, I mean it was published in a Josei magazine.
For me, seinen and josei are the same
butler: YES! MORE ANIME! MUAHAHAHAHAHA!!
Bronies Pegasister, Girly/Guyly
Lesbien, Homo
I want to see a steampunk + scifi + magic world now
Whatever, same name, same target
Actually, I don't let demographics alter my opinion either :$
Shizuka: can you link the thing you linked earlier please?
the fav.me thingy
im pretty sure that was it aniderp|bestcakeever lol
Polydunami: So I say, I love Usagi drop for its' "Seineness" :p
oh
That's a pretty tacky looking necklace.
Right then
Polydunami: If your definition of seinen is exclusively violent or sexual based mangas that would not be released in a "Jump" type publication, you are probably right. Usagi Drop is more of an emotional, relationship based manga that is probably a bit more Josei than Seinen, but calling it a run-of-the-mill Shoujo manga is a little insulting to this story.
No, that's not what a seinen manga is to me
Vordox would lupin the 3rd be seinen
Yes, the Nanoha franchise has a rather complex story.
alexxm|colt: Lupin 3, eh...
Hmmmm
Can't say really.
I love the orchestral version of this BGM used at thestart of the first movie.
dat jaymoo here?
YUUNO!!
Ok guys i must be off to class, see yall later tonight ^_^
See you, BladedWings
Polydunami: You know what's fun
Polydunami: K-On is Seinen Type
I think I just destroyed your world
Oh yeah?
Sorry
00,10Man that atomic ash is still falling
You're not exactly arguing with an idiot, you know
Where the hell does Yuuno GO after A's anyway? He basically disappears off the face of the franchise by the time StrikerS starts.

Fallout Magic Science Whatever-the-fuck Edition.
00,10he's at his job
Polydunami: I know
anyone here play guild wars 2?
Polydunami: But Josei/Seinen for me is the same. :P
The category is failing due to the intersex changes of preferences
Sumica: He should at LEAST write or something.
You've heard of 20th Century Boys, yeah?
Been doing it for years(Heck even as far back as 1800ish)
Nope Polydunami
Oh
Well, have you heard of Monster?
Polydunami: Yes, but haven't read it
Polydunami: I see somebody is a Naoki Urusawa fanboy.
00,10Monster is stupid long
I wouldn't call myself a fanboy
Seriously
Sumica: No, One Piece and Naruto are stupid long.
00,10no they are just stupid
Monster is just long.
I like the mangas he wrote, but I'm not the obsessive type
Yet :P
You know what's fun...?
what?
There are vety few anime creators I'm fanatical about.
I see why I have a differen defintion of Seinen
*very
If you can make a character over the age of 25 interesting in manga, with serious discussion about life = Seinen
That's my definition
And I mean that as a protoganist
00,10I dont even pay any mind to those names Vordox
Yeah, neither do I
The only anime creators I'm fanatical about are Studio Ghibli, SHAFT, Kyoto Animation and GAINAX.
What?
Name?
I haven't said any name
00,10the shit you been discussing for the last hour
The demographics
Oh, the target audience
it really seems pointless semantics
Well yeah but I just found out what I see as Seinen
00,10If I like it I keep watching it if I dont I delete it
I just wished for Poly to understand my view of Seinen.
Sumica: Dat run-on sentence.
HEIL SPELLCHECK
Besides, I'm kinda tired of "HAI I AM 12 YEAR OLD I SAVE THW EOWRLD BEFORE I CAN THINK STRAIGHT YAAAAY" <--- Stories

????????????????????????????????????
:D fanfic?
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Drawfriend Stuff #652
Or is it a joke about VAs?
there's a whole lot of wat here
Okay, that ending isn't right
the joke is that the blue big protoss unit was a stalker
cuz that's what they're called
Did Craig McKraken voice a Protoss unit? :D
dont think so
Now he's in prison?
00,10for killing a cop
I'll be back later
I'm out
Did I miss plot? In this thing?
MadSurge, I think you might've
He was framed.
'cause this doesn't look like the cartoon to have plot
the monarch is in prison, DV and Brock go to a Rocky Horror showing
actually it's pretty plot-heavy
00,10there goes the X-1
And why was everyone hurt?
00,10Brock rampage
inept attack by monarch goons I think
been a while since I saw it
After having seen Rocky Horror Picture Show for what I will insist on being the only time, I think I get the reference, now.
RHPS is awesome though
^
I've had mute on this whole time, I come back see the venture brothers... I hate myself now >.>
rhps?
There was a Scooby Doo reference, though. Where Dr Venture said that you don't need a proton pack to catch a jerk in a rubber mask.
oh
Kandarihu: you don't?
o its easy rider plot twist episode
ugh, this is so frustrating
sry i just ruined it if youve seen easy rider
I'm taking a course at another college next semester and there's this complicated registration process
I went and got all the signatures and everything required and brought it over to the other college
and they're like "Oh okay, we'll just take these and send them over to your college"
MadSurge, they were using equipment resembling that of the Ghost Busters who used energy beams to trap ghosts. Turns out the ghost ws more akin to the ghosts of Scooby Doo who were only people disguised as ghosts who sought to scare away outsiders, the protagonists included.
00,10Dr O amuses me
DO you have a Moxie?
he does that
Birch beer.
Three weeks later I'm still not registered for the course so I go to ask the registrar at my school what's wrong
Mr. Pibb! Tell me you have Mr. Pibb!
they're like "you never gave us your forms, you were supposed to give them to us"
anybody ever had Moxie?
Disco fries?
I have.
Moxie is...interesting.
they call the other college who apparently lost them or something
it sounds good when i read about it
wat
wat.
I'm convinced that Dr. Orpheus is from New England.
Btw you can't get knocked out by a hit on the head. If that's the case, you just suffered potential brain damage
So now I have to get all the signatures _again_
being unconscious is REALLY bad for you
and they're all acting like it's my fault, like "Oh we would never just take those forms from you, that's not how it works
haha i like when punk pony dances
schools and colleges are very good at screwing things up
00,10punk....
The hell, parasitic twin?
more or less
Apparently. =/
The fact that Dr. O likes Moxie and birch beer means he has to be from New England.
DocSane, makes sense.
I am not very happy with them right now
Kandarihu: I say that because I've only ever seen Moxie and birch beer here in New England.
lol you stole my haur!

You dun fucked up. ~The Monarch

So AppleBloom, you, and I area all spoiling.

He's hungry like the wolf.
lel one does not simply escape from brock
They had a lot of trouble getting the rights to this music.
So there are new Venture Bros :D

I can't understand one word he says
The Monarch
Poor Monarch, trapped in Superjail.
one time I had this lady on the phone who didn't understand the concept of typing a URL in the address bar, so every page I told her to go to she was typing in bing...
I never noticed, but Brendon Small voiced Nathan Explosion?
he does like 75% of the voices on that show
nope. it was nolan north >.>
bravo.\
King Gorilla having pet Tarzans?

...King Gorilla is gay that's why he said that

lel, misping
who's the voice actress for Takuma?
not ur fault thelonepony it was on proffesional hyper duper super difficulty
Because they give them more than money needed to make a great show to promote merchandise. It's like what Hollywood does to movies, but screws up the franchises.

i wonder what the anatomy of patamon is
Stopwatch: takura did vadermon
goofbye teeth
if he can compress air like that
takuma*
that would require tissue resembling kevlar in stability
i like that music very 90s anime
00,10So Tai took a trip back to the real world for a few hours
Stopwatch: takeru is yamamoto

00,10adblock+ should prevent that
scootaloo is awesome .-.
It's an ad-on before you ask.
00,10Seems ABP works better on firefox
the only awesome horse is yellow quiet
Buytoast: and Party gum

best horse is rainbow brash
Best horse is White Generous.
Sceptileknight: digimon
rainbow terrible is one of the worst

FreezerBurn: it was Hijacked

00,10Was not a hack but yes
So..
Sumica is the only one here who can make good food
:P
FreezerBurn: there was no hack. just mips being stupid. they dont hide the stream key and it was there for the world to see. so some random kid took over with that
:)
FreezerBurn: it's like leaving a car parked with door open and the keys in the ignition. and then some hobo steals it
i dont make freinds i make evil ppl .-.
Yes they hijacked a stream about bullying
00,10Damn Jyou you suck

00,10Jellybean|Drawing depends
00,10this is ep 23
friggin wormtonguemon
WHY DO YOU FREAKS BELIEVE THIS THING
Jellybean|Drawing: Fluffeh?
This show is my childhood.
this looks like a ripoff of pokemon
00,10Depends on which you count first
FreezerBurn: Oh God, we are NOT going there again.
FreezerBurn: RABBLE RABBLE RABBBL
pokemon was first if i recall correctly
00,10this anime came after pokemon. But the game it's based on came first
i dont like pokemon anyway
i was just sayin
Digimon >>>>>>>>> Pokemon
ONICAHN
Digimon were an outgrowth of the Tamagotchi, which was a early virtual pet. It's really got nothing to do with POkemon, which is a simplified RPG.
the way i see it pokemon does better games digimon does better anime
00,10nice greating. "you are alive"
Pokemon anime is as original as CoD
I almost think activision do the writing
^
00,10matt you doush
<TheGentleManBrony>: I don't know about that. Neither are great but Pokemon was occassionally enjoyable and focused on its license
i think i'l wear a MUSTACHE
this is just relationship drama mostly
MadSurge: yesh.
egg guy is creepy
jellybean!
pwnd
Jellybean|Drawing: watcha drawing? :3

Ponies47: She wubs you :3
MadSurge: Are you thinking of splitting in half, rather than splitting into 2 groups
99 buckets of oats on the wall
If you wait 100 or so eps maybe some "pimple boobs" will grow on the female characters
99 buckets of oast
/me hugs Jellybean|Drawing "silly"

For you, coming into your village might be the most epic day of your life........

Plane pirates, ahoy!
IT WAS TUESDAY

Tailspin!
Kid has balls of steel
aniderp|bestcakeever: well, go drink some coffee then :P

Sumipony!

Barrel rolling before Donkey Kong was cool
wall hacks!!
Another cartoon I watched when it was new. And now that I see it again, I'm really noticing how spastic all of the character movement is.
in a world where hobos with blunderbusses are pirates
00,10slowist take off speed ever
lol
Kandarihu: Ed Edd n' Eddy was the worst for it, but I think it was intentional
I was once a pony/brony hater, until i was bored one day and watched the show to see why bronies liked it
never regreted it
Sumica: you question the flight dynamics of a show that has a giant slab of iron fly on a few tiny rotors
?
>giving alchoholic beverages to kids
cider :P
i think that's soda
00,10it's also got gasbags Dark_Horst
dont do it
Serenity: I don't think that's beer.
Dinsking and piloting :I
It was pretty much a staple of western animation ever since limited animation became taboo. It's why western animation blows through a much larger budget than anime.
Wierdest looking can'o'coke I've seen
Sumica: yeah, but they're tiny for that thing
00,10true
*Cue "Ride of the Valkyries."
was anyone else here once a my little pony hater
00,10then again non of the craft have enough wing for there mass
just came back...
FreezerBurn, eww ponies, they're so gay >_>
I still hate the community
that's an interesting machinegun placement
Everlasting_Joy good queue :D
Oh. It's Tail Spin.
why didnt anybody in world war havwe that idea?
AdamTheDuck: Agreed.
FreezerBurn, maybe when G1 was fresh.
i watched the show cause i wanted to find out why bronies liked it
FreezerBurn, I cannot imagine grown adults coming together to watch unnatural colourful adolescent equine <_<
Dark_Horst: Because trenches are indy
00,10flaps wut
"colourful" <3
he shoulda pulled a crazy ivan
"This is no time for a Chinese fire drill!" Given your operation, I thought it was!
Those fund raisers bronies do are so lame too. >_>
coast guard. savour this moment
<--- I have this game on NES :D
BYE GUYS :)
they'll never be that effective again
See you FreezerBurn
Bye FreezerBurn
00,10if only they could come at the city from some other direction
Bye FreezerBurn
see you saturday
probobly
Haha Wut. :D
<--- This is VERY Grimdark existance....
Why does that kid feel like it's such an honour to be in a plaen?
It's Like BronyState was it's own TV Network. We got a watermark and everything!
Sumica: this hunk of iron probably cant fly high enough to get over the mountains. seeing how it's a miraqcle it flies at all^^
StinkomanFan: Don't say this
StinkomanFan: Nowadays, it's the only "TV" I watch
StinkomanFan: This is highly illegal you now.
know*
Serenity: Maybe because bears don't normally pilot planes.
hey everypony :)
Howdy Sketch_Toku_Brony!
00,10or you know perhaps come in a plane that's not covered in pirate logos
how are things Sketch_Toku_Brony
MASF123|TF2: What do you mean? Are you trying to say that Bears aren't supoosed to be part of the "Fookin' japanese military?"
Hi Sketch_Toku_Brony
Sumica: but how else are they supposed to show everyone how eeeeevil they are?
alexxm|colt: good, just got some jack in the box :D
Serenity: No sir.
And the cap
Serenity, this isn't anime.
Oh uhhh..
00,10By sneaking in and taking over the city
I should report them right? Because I see loadsa bears
Sumica: but that wouldn be piraty. yarrrrr
lol
oh NOW he isn't relaxed

now all we need is a redhead
lel at the zahmbeez
Yeah, but aren't the Scouse enough?
YOU CANNOT AVOID THE BANK
IT'S EVIL
gorilla birds?
err
Gorilla birds? Huh. Points for creativity.
eating the plane ? rly ?
They're eatin' mah brain! :O
:D
ah Tailspin, back when Disney TV cartoons were still good
More Naz- I mean pirates.
Dem bullets in a Disney cartoon.
there was a jungle book series?
...yeah, tha'S a sound flightpath
Back when Disney TV cartoons were block-syndicated.
with bullets?
and planes?
wut
It's definately a fucked yp one
It's a spin-off I heard.
[]DeadpoolDash: lol agreed this and Gargoyles,not like that pair of kings crap they show now :D
00,10his flying is good, but his landings need work
cachi01|blackcops2: Tailsspin
even Duck Tales and Darkwing Duck were good
[]DeadpoolDash: aw yeah those too!
In canada you can't have a childerns TV show with "war" in the title :<
00,10Gargoles is a good show
darkwing duck is the one with pokemons right?
cachi01|blackcops2: it's called tailspin. shirkan is a neutral evil corporation boss
Dark_Horst......................
Beast Wars -> Beasties, War Planets -> Shadow Raiders
nazi?
00,10Deplane deplane
I like Darkwing Duck, because when you're in trouble you call D.W.
I'M GET MY OWN PLANE
and they came
Doctor walrus?
AND HOOKERS
I'm on a boat!
what kind of hookers?
I'm on a boat, muthafu-
Slavery much?
There are a lot of real aviation issues and facts that they deal with in this show
pretty unique villain design. in tailspin he is neither really evil, nor actually good. everything he does he does for the gain of his coporation
:'(
Those gorilla birds are as Baloo described.
he allies with the "good guys" from time to time, if it benefits him
Dark_Horst: oh god
and the feathers
Dark_Horst: apple?
how are these bird related to gorilla ?
cachi01|blackcops2: apple?
idk they eat bananas?
Is that Jim Cummings?
wow. He got offended really quickly
00,10makes you wonder what the turnp and sandpaper were for
Lol.
Sumica: Foxrape
00,10yes MASF123|TF2
Sumica: Well I can understand the sand paper, but the turnip baffles me.
Wrek: You awake? :p
cachi01|blackcops2: not that evil
Damn ads. :(

00,10yeah first ep
I thought so

flutter_spin: whats the deal with your name? :3
00,10plot?
Sumica? is the green maned pony with black atire is your OC? :D
jcelios: First thing that came to my head was Fluttershy & Sonic Spinball
I combined the two
Tail Spin was making deliveries way before Futurama

Tailspin is a classic
Oh I remember this show now!
like Darkwing Duck
weeping_pegasi82: its an old cartoon, was old when i watched it as a kid x.x
remember, this was back in the 90s so the dollar was worth more(and the euro didnt exist)
Whoah, Tailspin? That's nostalga right there.

Alchemist: Havent seen him like... for like 10 days or so
:P

why does it sound like, "Wipe their ass"?
LOL
00,10So far as i know no we are not
I watched it when it was current. That was back when I was in High School, I think. My mother would pick me up every afternoon from school and take me to her workplace where I'd watch it during the last few hours of her workday.
that's like... forever!
home Alone juz leciał :D
thelonepony: I wonder whats up with him...
We should watch Elf
nie masz co sie martwic

Elf
00,10no just skype
Sumica: Oh can I join? :D
Sumica: You're not going to finish the Tailspin pilot?
oh

00,10it's 6 eps long J_E_Smith71
dayum
dats long
O.o
6 episode? a pilot?
We can do it!
wut?
my connection and hardware can't handle skype and a game like PS2 at the same time
sounds like it was meant to be a movie
Wat dis song ?
00,10it was a movie
CrystalPhoenix: It was originally presented as a TV movie on its first airing
I winz!
oooooooh
00,10that was how they did the disney after noon shows
CORN OOOOON
THE COOOOOB
00,10Corndance
What is with that image of her with corn?
I never got the reference.
i still dont get the cadance corn thing
The Disney Afternoon shows did that with DuckTales, Chip n' Dale, and Tailspin. Though they went to just a two-parter pilot for the later shows like DarkWing
Or is the reason pony.
00,10it's one of those pocket meme things
00,10like Trixie and pinecones
cachi01|blackcops2, Barbetos|AtWork all I got is something that cannot be unhear
wat
yeah the first several episodes of tailspin where pretty epic
so were the last ones
CrystalPhoenix: k pls tell us
I forgot what episode that scene is from.
00,10Darkwing had a full movie too
Daring Duck of mystery, champion of right. Swoops right from the shadows...Darkwing owns the night.
season 2 episode 2
00,10as did Gargoyles
SOmewhere some villian schemes, but his numbers up.
3...2...1! Darkwing Duck!
Tiem to get some hot wings.
Wednesday night. Awww yeah
This is madness! lol
Darkwing Duck had a movie for the pilot, Sumi?
Sumica: Darkwing's first ep was just a two-parter
shit, Gqargoyles had this kick ass board game/vhs thing
00,10yeah
where you watch the movie
and play the game based off shit like that
and The Powerpuff girls had a movie for the Pilot I am guessing?
i think my grandma still has that
Buytoast: wait, really? damn

I liked*
Megaman

They streamer does
Ohh, come to think of it, I think it came out around the Saban dub of Dragon Ball Z.
00,10feel free to block them
You know what's sad? The Megaman cartoon was going to look like the games but they changed it because they didn't think the demograph would like it:p
I'll disable the ads then XD

Drew, the Blue Refresh Button under the stream is there so that you can refresh the stream without messing with the IRC
this was actually pretty cool
seriously... creative name for a show
00,10and yes it's in mono
it has lasers too
Wait, what was that cop cartoon, and they worked with "cartoon" characters?
Aww...! I thought we were going to get Cops, as in "Bad boy! What'cha want, what'cha want, what'ca gonna do..."
What? No Cadillacs & Dinosuar fans?
Oh yeah.. Peter Chung did the character designs for this.
lol, thx
Lol. I always laugh when I see this intro. At the time if I watched it, it was probably good.
Is anyone else not getting out of their right channel?
Cadillacs and Dinosaurs was beast
bitch threw a CAR
shoulnt be the theme song to Cops "Bad boys?"
XD
00,10this show had some good desgines
:O

A ROBOCOP SHOW!???
Peter Chung made Aeon Flux.
You know, I've never even seen the actual Robocop.

I...THINK I watched this. Not sure.

They had this on Adult Swim as a joke.
oh yeah. there also was a chuck norris cartoon
Because, you know, this totally makes sense.
00,10bet the next one will be Chucknoris show

Scruff McGruff be damned! We have Robocop!
Forgot if I watched this or not.

Teen Wolf!
AHHH mono hurts my ears
Okay, THIS is 90's, I think.

BEWARE THE FULL MOON DAVID.

The movie of this was....yeah...

Man, the full moon lasts all day.

Not sure if I saw this. Maybe I just saw ads for it.

that castle is giving us the finger
Attack of the Killer Tomatoes! FINALLY something I know I watched!
NO
OK, NEVER SAW THIS ONE
NOT THIS
Attaaaaaaaaaaack of the Killer Tomatooooooooes~
Wait, this was a thing?
Woah, even THIS had a cartoon spinoff?
THIS IS THE WORST THING EVER
ataaack of the killer tomatoes!
wahaaaat? xD
at 1st thoat it was a troll show...
I dont like tomatos
Hahaha whaaaaat?!?!?!?!? :D
YES!
Needless to say, this cartoon did not take itself seriously AT ALL
The movie was awesome, I don't care what anybody says.
o.o
wth is that ? attack of the killer tomato ?
This cartoon was fricking glorious
Who the FUCKIN FUCK greenlighted this?!
damn i type like a drunk
I remember this.
omg i was actually right 0.0
street sharks was decent
:O
it's so ridiculous
STREET SHARKS!
not the best, but i have seen worse
oh shit, street sharks
see previous
The movie series is still enjoyable after all these years
I hear this show is totally jawsome.
oh yeah, street sharks. the less successful show B)
kinda looks like battle toads :X
Street Sharks, back to the cartoons I vaguely remember.
00,10so cheesy a show
haha street sharks
This aired with biker mice, and Biker Mice was much better.
Damn I feel so lame liking this
Sumica: extrem dinosaurs. do it
Street Sharks reminds me a lot of TMNT. Looks like a similar vein.
But they are sharks... on the street!
soooooooo round 30 town solo >.>
CK|ded: same formula
dam adds
A lot of cartoons were made in the image of TMNT CK, so it's not unusal to think that.
I mean...I liked it as a kid
They swim through concrete?
Dark92Enigma: Was it any good?
tankster: adblock+
this was awesome
00,10I kinda liked this one
Robot Chicken made fun of these, saying "this show's totally original! We're not ripping off TMNT!"
I heard that ended in a cliff hanger
This show, however, was great.
Oh, Mighty Max. I loved this show so much.
oh Mighty Max, my uncle was an animator for this ^_^
wat
I never see this one
I actually really did like this.
Oh cool, Mighty Max
ok this looks interesting
Tim Curry and Tony Jay were in this
There was continuity to this one, of sorts.
Oh! I've seen some of this show. The dialogue was very good.
totally NOT aliens
^
Spiiiiiiders!
CK|ded: don't remember much of the show to give it a proper analysis (i refer to the Steet Sharks show)
virgil!
My brother used to have some of the shark toys - wonder what happened to those...
HOORAY! for not knowing any of these!
jcelios: cool!
Odd, but this always reminded me of Bucky O'Hare.
Dark92Enigma: I never saw it so.
Mighty Max was the shit!
ad kicks in just in time :)
This seems cool
cachi01|blackcops2: he's done a lot of animation :3
oh damn i missed alot :(
well 80ies and 90ies were the time mutants and lasers equaled successfull show
00,10fail orignal audo of a good ep
The young boy demographic was powerful, and sold tons of merch >.<
How many software engineers does it take to screw in a lightbulb?
Yeah, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles started the bandwagon.
00,10so more retrojunk
ahh robotech
And then there was Robotech.

derp
one of the best show EVER.
i wonder how bat mobile takes tight turns
Well folks, thanks for the Nostalga overload but I'm off for some DotAII
TAS was THE definitive Batman cartoon to me. The Batman was a pale imitation in my book... even though I still watched that.
or where he can park
Suzano: With grappling hooks.
I WANT TO WRITE A FANFIC
WHY YOU DO THIS SUMICA
Never liked Batman...sorry.
The Batman was a fantastic cartoon.
Suzano: Batman's driving it. THAT'SD how.
