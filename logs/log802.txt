Hi

A year here, and this is the first time I've seen it slow down below a message every half a minute.
this music is helping me write
Vunderbar.
YOU'RE OLDER, CANARY
<3
OLD LADY
WRINKLES AND EVERYTHING
Old ladeeeeee
I'm likely older.
i'm 20 and my gf is 13
I beat all the admins I think
Are we back on age again?
Not really. :D
I'm one year older than you. >:|
haha sorry Ive been moving in and out of the stream :D
xD
DJBlaziken: I'd be hating if my son, 20 years old, had a thirteen year old GF.
permission granted
Canary, you may facedesk.
Facedesk commence
*Wait
/me facedesks
20 years old with a 13 year old girlfriend?
because you dont need all those braincells :D
she asked me
braincells are for the weak
Oh I have braincells.
weakness is for the weak
usa the country that killed bin laden
age? no?
/me facedesks once more
OOH MONEY :3

PS4, possibly coming Summer 2013
oh never mind then
the two are not blood related i hope
:o really?
this is much more interesting than my homework
lol
DJBlazikens
me and her are not related
hello everypony
and a possible release date by Mid June
Hello, someone with a name too hard to type out
because then Maury might not even let you on
lol
I hope when it comes out PS3 stays around as long as PS2 did
^
NICE?
We are... generally :D
how is streaming?
*who
Streaming is good ^_^
I hope that the PS4 can play PS3 games
/me crumples in shame in his addiction
I HAVE A PROBLEM i know oh luna waahhaah ;.
YOU DONT SAY.
WELL
Yeah
Can someone get that gif up here? :D
you know the one...
I'm still hanging on to my PS2 because my PS3 isn't one of the backwards compatible ones =/
like in Touhou
did the wall part 1-3 play before i got here
the 2006 models of the PS3 play PS2 games...
Don't know the exact version though
_And_ my PS2 refuses to play PS1 games for some strange reason...
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-s36L0_gcaFw/TzK3C6a_g0I/AAAAAAAADlA/evP1hIwgZ2s/s1600/misc-you-dont-say-l.png
Yeah, a couple of the early models did
Hey. Touhou games are hard as balls. Can't blame half the fanbase for not having the willpower to play them.
But they're really rare
No one wants to sell it if they have one
Its definately on my collectors list
DJBlaziken: Non-DSotM like WYWH and a bit of The Wall played before you were here.
and if they do it's like $500
One does not simply TRY to play Touhou...
I found myself another atari computer today :D
Eh, you kind of learn to just deal with it.
oh nice
I never said that...
Its called an Atari ST computer, released in 1985
^
Anyway.
I don't get that
all the games for it are floppy disk based
do you ever boot them up and play with them, or are they just for collecting?
of course I boot them up
I'm just pointing out not to before someone does.
If the price is cheap enough, ill buy it because of how expensive they are online
The one I bought today cost me $7 bucks
oh man
Wow, good deal
I know. I was refering to CyrstalPhoenix's "I don't get that"
i'm sorry but i'm dying over here
it'd be like Old Yeller
they normally cost at least $50 online
"No pa, I'll put down ol' Twilight."
and if they have accessories, it can cost you close to $100
"Uncle, They're my toys, I
*'ll do it"
oh and for the record
XD
That's awesome
"Remember boy, right between the stickers."
ill have to take a pic of it sometime
O_O;
^
good thing i haven't seen Old Yeller then
It's worth seeing.
oh I dont think it uses a lot of power
^
US......AND Theeeem~
Yep. Good book, good movie
It can be very sad, and boring maybe, but... jeez i'm showing my age
whats amazing is
it actually has a GUI
awwh yah D:
Yeah, sucks. He was two months older than I was.
he was long lived!
wow
he even wants to burn my rd hoodie

Yep

You should stay in america and confuse even yourselves
How about you dont run away.
Running is good for you
Cardio
Because you're 20 years old, and that's such a childish thing to do.
Even gods may fall with the relentless passage of time.
MURIKA is stronger than gods.
ZUUUL
Does it make you feel like an adult to say childish?
His heart pumping courage into our souls.
Nothing. I did not mean it in a mean way honestly.

how dare you
HMU?
insult MURIKA'S proud boys
how many you?
I dont freaking know...
lol, there is still age discussion
If we had common in America we would have good shows.
Like IT Crowd.
And we would speak normal.
Also we would use metric
i thought we were done with this age talk
If there's one thing the US has to do pronto it's convert to metric already.
negitive vibes man lets get some positive vibes in here
Then don't say you are one.
Even if it is not there.
And I hate everything now
Ill just put a disclaimer before everything I say when I want to be a jackass :D
Hate everything?
Don't be like every other retard.

There's at least two different flavours of bullshit going on at the same time. It's wonderful.
*vibrations
The only good vibrations are the ones from those tootsie machines they got at Six flags.

Oh how I wish...how I wish you was here.
Now.
I guess I pissed off the wrong people or something.
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl.

I'm sure you'll sympathize with the protagonist.
If he was having a seizure he wouldn't of even been able to type that.

Can't you get really mild seizures that leave you mostly conscious?
all i got are these walgreens ones you swallow whole and taste like cardboard

Pills aren't all that bad to swallow.

Oh shit. I just did it again

Well maybe it's a throw up between them then.
No, Barb. It's two completely different kinds of stupidity. They're mutually exclusive stupidities.
Try hard more.
And why do you care?
You should always ask that first
Drop it and move on.
Meesen
Its just for fun man, and if you don't get that then I am done with you.
Fun is not allowed here.

13it was labelled "bronystate chat"
D:

only if you ripped an outlet?
haha
o.o
I guess you're on a POWER TRIP?
Chat's actually more lively than it was an hour ago.
mweh
goodnight.
These are the jokes people.
05was fun to play with her

ARGH okay--
have to sleep, suddenly wanna draw EVERYTHING XD

13ps2 is too spaced out for me .-.
Gah, I hate it when I forget to type out words.
This matches my mood right now
13travel five minutes to get somewhere, die in three seconds
13everyone else is spending gobs of money on certs to win
night everypony
05Shizuka: you cant buy certs with cash
13can buy weapons though
13and cert boost
you can be quite proficient with non-best weapons
You're also a third thing that you'll never know.
13that's cause TF2 works hard to make everything balanced, plus random drops
05only if you want the 100 cert ones
05there are plenty of good 100, 250 and 500 cert oens
on my primary weapon for infiltrator
05heck the GD-22S is the most well used and considered best in slot for ehavy assault
ive got 200 certs and only have about 8 hours in
05it costs 100 to unlock
I have EXACTLY 1 mod for it, the 12x scope
05but i agreee
13is mostly turning me off by how little it does to entice a player used to faster paced and more balanced things like tf2
05unlocked items being character bound and not account bound
05that is bullshit
^
05hehe
05ocne i got a hang of takign myself around the maps
05etc
and some can be exploited
05im realyl enjoying it
Didnt MC also have a pretty sizeable community upon release?
05Shizuka: for isntance you missed a blatant speedhacker on stream when i was playing earlier
13was just not as much fun :/
05once of my favorite guitarists
for my first time hearing him
05TTK could be anotehr second
it doesnt take an hour to get where you are going, or you are doing something wrong, which I admit doing sometimes :)
13run to objective, instakilled from behind, wait 10 seconds to respawn, try spawning closer, get spawncamped
05marchign togetehr
05pushign agasint a wall untill it finally falls over
13sometimes i don't get a choice
13plenty of times they were all up at the front managing to not die
05djblazekin: u like? :p
13which led to hiking for ten minutes only to die two seconds upon reaching the front, assuming i got up that far
i've had to hike up to 1500m on more than one occasion
thats a bitch
yes it's 20% cooler than whats on the radio right now
13tf2 i can at least HIT something..
13even once..
Goodmorning **
I can hit things up to... 600m off?
13it looks pretty
:D
13that's... about it
:D
05ooooo
05dat guitar
13capturable cells is nice but that's just a three way larger version of 5CP, and i don't like 5CP
05shiiinyy
13too much stalemate not enough accomplishment
i would agree with that
05CTF cap bases are coming :3
13getting even a single damage dealing hit, let alone a single kill, was my greatest accomplishment possible with PS2... even with all these guys that have been on it for months
13don't feel like i'm part of a bigger thing, just feel like it's doing everything it can to keep me from playing
05Ryunosuke: hey ive had my fair share of streaks :P
as have I :)
05oh also
05Shizuka
13if anything i was very very spoiled by tf2's careful design... SOE must have not heard of silhouettes at all because every single player, friendly or not, looks identical

05love this song
needs 20% more siezure
that would be nice
pal = 50fps ntsc = 60fps
Couldnt cartridge tilting certain games switch that around? I vaguely remember LoZ being capable of doing it
05that works
no
oh ok
no the hardware in a pal n64 pervents it from playing at 60 fps
I could list the reasons.
Lol 'butthurt'
soit can only run at 50fps
mean?*
Rainbow Dash? Not sure. :D
and do you consider baking a cooking 2 different skills?
Yes.
In some cases, yes.
Baking doesnt allow deviation in most cases from the recipe
Id be eager to try something Pinkie Pie cooked :)
Dont care; worth it. :D

08,01PonyNegZero: you're actually along the right lines
Saturn: my brain is not quite working at 3 am after studying circuits
it gives me a Wikipedia page on "The Ideal Gas Law"
I didnt need to take calculus... Took stat instead
I never did take calculus
08,01PonyNegZero: you're literally one operand off
08,01think chain rule
08,01no
08,01it's maths
lagged out there for a sec
hmm, looks more like math to me
08,01Canadian_Brony: dialects, beeyatch.
I never did take calculus. I'm afraid of change :P
Stop using words I don't know the meaning of!
no -__-
okay, I do now
08,01Dialect - a. A regional or social variety of a language distinguished by pronunciation, grammar, or vocabulary,

Saturn: Guards! Guards! was the only one that showed up that day.
The rest might come later this week hopefully

08,01PonyNegZero: yup
I'm rather disappointed in myself for taking that long to think of it....
08,01which can actually be simplified to e(t - 1)
It was stupid hard unless you read the book
Never would have heard of the book without TV Tropes :P
08,01er, e^(t - 1)
Oh whoops
08,01i'm actually crap at maths
Yes, TV Tropes can be good for some things :P
/me 08,01prefers computers to maths
I found out about Katawa Shoujo by way of TV Tropes

Hm? Is that a problem?
Oh, I see

and I get random feed blackouts too
you think i would die before i could make her my gf
You need to pique her curiosity to speak to her
Therefore, a stance
That's the edged conversation
but shes selfish too
dont forget that
That's why you should pique her interest
It's HER interest after all
then she looses interest
and then ded

Gettin' emotionally involved.

<--- This is why I dislike her
She's torn

Thereby, torn ideals. :P

HAHHAHAHAHAHAH
FUCKING IDIOTS
and that's why you go NC
'MURIKA
Live free in the NC.
FUCK YEAH
AdamTheDuck:the terrans actually, that's more
Too bad I can't run it
wut
did just happen to my sentence
05yes there is difference
civilians that took up arms
Everyone is a jerk, just pick the jerks you like.
sure
one of my other fave animes are angel beats and deadman wonderland
05the Vanu
05spandex wearing dubsteppers
^
religious cultist fanatics
lmao
05and to plug my own faction
The best faction you mean.
violence
hopefully by then
<--- I create my own Faction
The Straighteners
05come to th NC
And we dont take any shizzz
00,10and best looken tanks
Amen to that.
also our guns fell like GUNS!
Can you shuffle between factions or are you permanently stuck to one after you choose?
*feel
lol am i the only one seeing these 3 factions as the 3 pony tribes? :D
11,02New newsletter posted on the site~ http://www.bronystate.net/newsletter/
ouo: aaaah pretty horsie :3
i just need to replace my amd atlon x2 5000+
and my graphics card then i'm set
lol
Is PS2 Free?
ouo: dat pony
Okay fine
But not because of the faction
F2P
it has micro transactions though be weary
or am I thinking of Tribes Ascend
how mutch is tribes assend
its free as well
http://funzoo.ru/uploads/posts/2010-05/thumbs/1272988162_poni_001.jpg
can you run it requires a plugin install but its a one time thing
that awkward thing
or maybe its a gpu thing too
i'm going to upgrade my desktop and i'm wondering if i should get the i 5 or i7 overclocked
i5 should bhe enough
athlon x2 5000+
but if you have the money of course
not really, i have i7 3770k with 670gtx, 16gb ram and ps2 still laging after playing 2 hours or more
ouo: then you're cooling is inefficient
no
it 45C
then again, planetside eats a lot of performance
all time
*your
05planetside 2 is far from optimized
right now i have a geforce 6150le
05an i5 should run it easely once the opt patch comes
last time i checked, amd processors are usually behind intel
the bulldozer system doesnt really cut it
512...
yep ps2 retty bad optimzid, i beleave it has some bad memleaks
ouo more like LOD
building one is pretty cheap
Planetside 2 = Take you to a gay bar 0 NC
:D
XD
it's gameplay befor graphics for me like girls personality befor looks
I think my motherboard is too old for ddr3. =/
for example, a kingston hyperx ddr3 8GB set only costs 35 bucks. the same in ddr2 would be over 100+
to me at the end of the day, ram is ram
Hey night all got to hit the hey
Ram = power
2gb ddr2 ram
Not CPU
23 bucks, it's cheap
*
35
I care more about getting 8GB and up more than if its DDR3 or whatever
Ram is the capacity
Let's put an analogy
We have a sprinter
He has a Mind(CPU) that handles things in accordance
hi
also a nice 1155 cpu socket
that's the one you want
i know alternate in germany
otherwise, no idea
My hubby and I like to buy the parts and build them together. :>
Makes the PCs more special
I know that ibuypower and cyberpowerpc do prebuilt
used to have a desktop from them
800 can build a pretty smoking fast machine, if done right
you also have to plan ahead for upgrades
when in doubt, reag gaming magazines

and then the following month Ill buy a desktop
11,02aniderp|bestcakeever: Check the FAQs on the site :P
Maybe it's because I grew up in a place where Twister was a really popular movie, but I don't see it. >.>
didnt people die in twister?

08,01PonyNegZero: none of mine do either, but i just set it for courseworks and exams

You're not SUPPOSED to take ANY of the series seriously

08,01Moonbutt: coming from someone called "moonbutt", this is quite a statement

Did you know that full plate armor gives a higher range of motion than chain mail?
Chain mail is safer against everything
05which is why arrows were effective agaisnt cahinmail
Yeah
05and it jsut pierced the thin plate
It has zero advantages
05best defence is to be the one that strieks first
If I would go to war, I would wear it. :P

05then a leatehr tunic
05adn a cape/hood
05sword
05hidden dagger in case of emergency

Some evidence indicates that during armoured combat the intention was to actually get around the armour rather than through it—according to a study of skeletons found in Visby, Sweden, a majority of the skeletons showed wounds on less well protected legs.
Sure =D

00,10ohmy
was something about me climbing steps of a slide a lot of steps and 2 kids floowlong me or something then bla,ming me that they fell ;_;
00,10lol wut
Saturn: and then good times?
Saturn, o.o
08,01it didn't leave much to the imagination

Implying you still aren't.
i once lived in the streets myself
it was fun, i stole everything i needed to survive
i was once an orphan

08,01i had to dumpster dive for food
xD
00,10Never got to the point where I was on the streets but did spend alot of tome liveing in a motel
well i was beaten often ;_;
There's mean and there's honest, that was the latter.
Hahah
:D
winter is coming
i felt like one though
08,01i'd have become a prostitute
psh
prostitution is below me.
:D
A *cute* feral starving girl
08,01in fact, i was very close to becoming a male escort once
How much more "feck you" can it be
Saturn, close? .-.
If prostitution is below anyone I don't think it's you.
with my sex appeal, you would become a seductress, its like a prostitute, but more long term with a client
lol
Cherchez la femme~
08,01AdamTheDuck: yeah; i would have done it too, if circumstances hadn't forced me out of the city i was living in
/me 08,01has absolutely no qualms about it
/me she got paid for midding some chats on chatango
08,01it's fun and good money
05but srsly
the heck? it cut words out
05i get disgusted hearing about peopel that cant have a safe haven they can call home
I'll avoid it if at *all* possible. Being both trans and a prostitute doesn't sound too safe.
europe wasnt good to me
08,01Rose`Bed: come over to scotland at some point; we can get hilariously drunk and poke the pondlife
I let ANYONE I know into my house
:D
No matter how little I know them
Saturn, and this was a bad idea? :$
Saturn: And that's bad?

08,01Vordox: well, in reality, i only get 10% more choice
08,01if you don't include farm animals.
<.<
Err I don't
08,01good, neither do i
you'd only be 100% if you were Everysexual
And trees.
08,01gdlk_ouo: this implies that you see children's dicks
oh dear..
Friends can be intimate, Saturn
08,01Vordox: various reasons; primarily that my male best friend was her fuck buddy
honestly >_>
I have! =D
08,01but there was a positive that came out of it
bi/pan best sexual
08,01they're now engaged!

05do you hold 2 separate bachelor parties?
08,01Wrek: i guess

(\ /)
Perhaps you hold one and then hold it again for the other one.
05do you have 2 best men?
08,01probably
2 bridal shower things?
<--- They forgot the arrow ambush
08,01aniderp|bestcakeever: since neither is the bride, i'm guessing not
/)6_9(\
it would be awkward to have both bridal showers at the same strip club
Saturn: Really? that's awesome!
2 lesbians getting married no birdal shower? D:
08,01gay weddings are great, in that there are no established customs
ARMUND!
08,01oh wait, yeah, women exist too
/me 08,01sometimes forgets

Too bad he turned out to be a tool.
08,01no no, he was austrian
08,01you're thinking of poland
00,10the proper responce to that Saturn is well then invite her over
O u immigrants.

You're Indian.

Braveheart would be terrible at tech support.
YOU CAN TAKE MY LINE, BUT YOU CAN NEVER TAKE MY DIAL UUUUUUUUUUUP.

08,01oh... yeah... what's his name... named after a computer...
05ah yes

05i like that movie
and immediately though NCR
05hackers that is
FREE!
05Saturn: why you asking me?
05she's free to hug whomever she likes
Because apparently groping people's other halves is ok if you ask first.
08,01Rose`Bed: no, it's fune
\o/~
tink and twinkle
/me hugs Saturn
i am really...
08,01i should be studying...
08,01instead, i'm on IRC and noodling on my bass guiatar

Oh hey, I was right.
08,01Lyra`: gasp.
/me hugs Saturn
08,01Lyra`: i have an evil twin!
STOLEN! i've been STOLEN! R2D2 WHERE ARE YOU!'¡?
08,01actually, i suspect i'm the evil twin
Probably.
wouldnt doubt it
be back in about half an hour babe
08,01my twin has a girlfriend
08,01i hate her
08,01absolutely despise her
Is she nice polite and well adjusted in society?
08,01which is odd, because generally, i don't hate people
Because that seems like the type of person you'd hate.
08,01Meanwhile: more orless... slightly more less
Is ''End of days'' in the list'?
08,01it's more that she's taking my brother away from me, i guess
/me 08,01is a bit posessive
05i think Saturn would liek this song
05its named jam it in the hole
08,01Lyra`: no
The ends justify the means.
oh good.
i wasnt sure if i needed to act ashamed
or rather, abashed

Kill yourself.
sociopathy for the win!

08,01Bronysith: honestly, why do i sometimes need to treat you like one of my 12 year olds....
05defien the difference between a moral and an ethic
08,01Wrek: morality is more dependent on beliefs; ethics are more dependant on philosphy
Ironic that the two most lacking in both of those have the answers.

"30583 hours later"

Yep
disneys lowest moment
Why? D:
and critics destroyed it
i remember watching it when i was sick
looking back on it though, the hero is like shinji
all he does is WHINE
Critics are assholes
he just whines
"i want to be a hero"
thats him in a nutshell
"I mustn't run away" :D
^
At least he and his group managed to defeat their villain, unlike Shinji :D
but the world ended
HAHAHAHA
lol oops
Good job Shinji. You failed at saving humanity. :D
well
Everyone is now Tang.
Shinji caused the end of humanity
not the world

MARRY ME GAINAX
Oh, they did the same thing at the end of PSG
gurren lagann is easily my fav anime ever
and evangelion is right behind that
evangelion is good
I generally don't like mindfuck endings. Especially if the series appears to make sense all the way up to that point.
These endings that swoop in out of nowhere and you're left going "wtf just happened"?
EoE was just a huge mindfuck metaphor for masturbation
Yeah
a kickass mech anime
i dont know if i want to get into FLCL
yes you do
i havent been disapointed by gainax yet
watch FLCL
FLCL is ... interesting
all in one go
It's worth watching at least once
And it's only 6 episodes long
wait waht?
You *must* watch it at least once
Dammit, I have the heater on and I'm wrapped up in a blanket. Yet the house is still cold (to me)
just saying
"Human" is stretching it
you mean pinkie pie?
It won me over cuz it makes references to Lupin. :>
YESH
doesnt it also have south park animation at some point?
I just know it's a REALLY random ride that throws you all over the place, but for some reason, you're enjoying the ride. :D
Exactly
It does have a comic strip format at one point :D
05cant recall
05wastn too logn ago sicne i remember the commercials on TV for the tour
lol, yeah I was going to mention that the animation goes all over the place, including some parts where it looks like they just took pages from the manga and pasted it into the screen. XD

Seinen manga (青年漫画?) is a subset of manga that is generally targeted at a 18–30 year old male audience, but the audience can be older with some manga aimed at businessmen well into their 40s. In Japanese, the word Seinen means "young man" or "young men" and is not suggestive of sexual matters. (The female equivalent to seinen manga is josei manga.

Did you say Usagi Drop was a seinen production?
It's kinda fun putting people on ignore. When they start a shitstorm, you only see one half of the conflict!
wait that was the fav.me thingy?
more anime?!?!
No, I mean it was published in a Josei magazine.
For me, seinen and josei are the same
butler: YES! MORE ANIME! MUAHAHAHAHAHA!!

Whatever, same name, same target
Actually, I don't let demographics alter my opinion either :$

There are vety few anime creators I'm fanatical about.
I see why I have a differen defintion of Seinen
*very
That's my definition
And I mean that as a protoganist
Yeah, neither do I
The only anime creators I'm fanatical about are Studio Ghibli, SHAFT, Kyoto Animation and GAINAX.
Name?

Oh, the target audience
it really seems pointless semantics
