PeanutButterWolf or they did

04If it was the other team sure but...
without CN there would be no second series

I mean, that as there is no source material to work from, the community is self-propagating the effects it is having on the direction it is taking everything, and hopefully this should be reined in a little (ha ha reined in) when S2 airs.

02ah, I see
Yeah it disappeared for me...
02Just tell me when you want to play :P
There's no theme switcher yet
yea there's no 'switcher'
but you can reobtain the themes to switch. takes 2 seconds
i don't actually mind which you use, just a little upset that people often see images disappear and I dont :(
Naw, links get deactivated once a theme is installed
It switches from "download" to "already installer" or something
Not sure, maybe I'll watch some ponies... or style Pinkie? :P
and style!!1
Because I installed my favorite theme first, then installed a bunch of others thinkin I could switch :P
well i dunno wat do today : /

Why has no-one made a Crysis 2 FIM mod yet
I think the reason is that it takes too much time, and not enough people are cooperating on projects.

Isn't Crysis one of those games that goes for crazy amounts of realistic detail?
yeah pretty much

I want to headbutt him
Because Rarity has a crush on him?
Naw, just because he's more self-centered than Trixie
Oh wait, is this an episode 26 mention?
I haven't watched it yet
IF HE SNOBS RARITY
eh?
No, she has a crush on him since episode 2 :P
or 3, I guess
It's 3, yeah
snobs? or snogs?
But you said he's self-centered, but I haven't seen him anywhere else in the show
It's just weird to have a crush one someone you've never even seen :P
ep 26
Yeah, thought he would appear on episode 26
and ofc u see him in ep 3
I have a crush on all ponies though
Rarity's 'HIM'
yeah yeah
but they're a different race, and fictional D:
lol no, I guess not really
(I say this because I do too and i'm still D; about it )

This scene is hilarious.

That kid is hilarious

People in the 80s were weird.

He dropped his pot....they were talking about drug dealing
6>>;
6I was wondering why you typed out the 0's in the first place.
7:D
Password had to include numbers.
:P
or the gunshots you hear in MLP:FIM. Real gunshots
And no one wanted to suggest one (Sathi did actually, but I'd already changed it by then)
All the gunshots in FiM are real gunshots.

It jumped out of the bushes
A server I've got set up.
I've said that a couple of times.
6Ah.
Which is why I suggested something else.
6Yeah, that's a problem...
It just wanted to be pet by Fluttershy
As in all the mods runs a server each for the duration of the BMN stream at least.
The ones not streaming anyway.
6That would require us all to have the ability to run a server.

*klutz*
To people on mIRC and any other client it wouldn't show lal the different colours.
it's never stable anyway.
Lolumad lady?
all*
U mad
She mad
I also had the idea of adding the ability to play games with people using the same client.
6Then they should be using the client that's built in to the stream page, which would be that client.
6That would be cool.
I haven't really seen that on IRC before.
6Give them something to do when the stream isn't on.

He touched the pepparoni. Ice him!
anyway, I'll be back eventually
and it doesn't follow standards either
6Which is all we'd need initially.
Some of our current users use mibbit to join their own channels though.
6Yeah...
Pedo corpse
Kids screaming and yelling under 2 inches of badly placed wooden floors
Gimme sugar, chump
or, meaning
a Browser isn't CPU intensive at all
6We can deal with mibbit until then.
Never seemed to have that problem with any of my browsers before :P
We'd have a ton of videos calling that corpse a pedo
And suing the producers
Yeah, crap for this time :P
Thank go we have that now

I couldn't tell where I was in that list.
Huh, that was still on...
WHERE IS MY WINTER WRAP UP BEST EPISODE?
:(
/me wonders why there was no film lottery for next week. Did we have that yesterday? I kinda fell asleep halfway during the stream...
I wanted to see Swarm of the Century myself.
No THE GREAT AND POWERFULL TRIXIE?
Awww, no Suited for Success???
6AND ON TO BUCKAROO BANZAI
12 chances and I still didn't win.. D:
I was hoping for Pinkie Keen or Stare master
I would have said Feeling Pinkie Keen.
>mfw faster than dari
Nittany_Tiger_ has good taste
is that INSTEAD of the normal show?
yes
i thought it was a bonus
extended editions
6It was specified at one point during raffle, actually.
Fine, Safari is the worst browser ever made then :P
Lawl
Look Before You Sleep is the worst episode.
EXTENDED YEEEAAA
goddammit, best episodes have to be on the day i can't come
4So HAH!
6I used to put it in the threads "G4 Pony Episode"
Look before you sleep is underrated
Movie ftw
6But I don't bother anymore...
4But man
Suddenly, SW text wall
...
BANZAIIII
I've never seen it specified.
4YFW only one episode that you predicted to get picked got picked
7different intro?
12Back in a bit.
7hahaha
They'Ve been changed a 'lil bit
7smart CB
You want it as a large PNG, Dman?
You read em?
...
...
7this movie... has a different intro :o
Someone needs to fix that graphic.
OH no. Oh no oh no. I don't know if I can take any more Buckaroo Banzai.
uuuhhh, mods, the nrew rules...well, the text...it's uh...pretty stretched out i have to say
10yeah different intro :P
oh wait you found it
GGgala: yfw it's there in RULESA
and the text is way squashed
LBYS is consistently regarded as the worst episode.
also GGgala it's pretty stretched right?
7they areup on the website
IMPOSSIBARU
12Meh, I forgot about Winter Wrap Up. Probably should have picked that.
DMan: mfw it wasn't an hour ago
eyup sathi like I said :3
lol GGgala
Yeah, rules graphic is squashed flat.
6I believe dari put them on the site.
@Dman, I'm on Ridley right now
7also the rules look odd... on the website
12But FWF is still a really great one, def one of my favorites.
Dman: *refreshes* looks like they changed the URL but not the height/width attributes
wait...I just entered the room and he wasn't there...wtf?
thanks!
6GGgala, yeah, I'll fix it when I get a moment, dari forgot to fix it.
7I liked my intro more :P
It's attached to his butt.
6It's because dari didn't fix the height/width of the image, and this one is MUCH larger than the old one.
Pinke Keen is merely the most loudly hated.
I thought they looked weird.
oh, there he is :P, dun dundun DUN DUN dun dundun DUN DUN
Assumed it was just the font or something.
is it for you, dman or someone else?
Nopony likes Feeling Pinkie Keen?
Ahh okay, cool, Dman
Pretty sure I didn't specify a height/width for the image though.
I like Pinkie Keen, people just don't like the moral I think is thing.
>mfw Season 2 has a Brokeback Mountain parody
7patience dman
All I did was put it on the page.

03as there's no point to that script besides pissing me off >_>
xD
06nope, she never told me too, only if people would ABUSE it
12drf just ignore lightumbreon
12XD
not me
Oh, well that makes sense then
only on fridays for me.
sure it does
03yeah, and swear words are just various letters
03what of it
03that does't mean it's not bad
06but since no-one EVER abused my scripts, i'm not going to de-activate them
AWESOME
10WIN
nice
10dari make me one
/me backs away slowly
excellent
It's a screwdriver with something blue in it?
lol
I don't have any of the drinks needed. :<
hypnotic?
13I can understand both sides of this, but I'm leaning more towards drf on this one
it's a rastafarian!
10dari my mate has the blue curacao. fund it
screwdriver+blueberry schnapps?
hypnotic is blue flavored vodka
13It'll take a lot of convincing to get me to believe you made the script for a purpose other than to annoy him :P
I'M BACK
electricity smells?
wait, smell electricity?!
Wtf
Yes, you can.
03^
electricity is supposed to smell of ozone
06why would i even think about annoying drf? i first thought he was joking, and now he's serious..well, no point going into that xD
Arcing electricity through the air creates ozone, which has a distinct odor.
03I can intentionally annoy certain people too, but I'm above that
03unlike some :/
yeah smells like o-zone
12yeah drf already did plenty of that in the past :P
BUCKAROO WAZZAP
12he's hip and up with the times
Satsuma

FFUU
GGgala: LOL
INB4 Rape
PEGACOOOOOOOOOORN<3<3<3<3<3
yup, that was clancy brown, I knew it.
Dman: you used it! :D
Many typos
06but mainly i make these scripts for shitz and giggles
03...
Anyway
03^
lol
I'll ask my parents to get me some blue curacao then.
12i don't quite agree with the situation but let me put it like this, everytime someone activates that script
12this is going to start all over again lightumbreon
12so really there is no point to having that script
*stands around a possibly radioactive ball*
Leaves from the vine
such logic :/
The.
Fuck.
03see
06alright then... if you guys insist
Twi's eyes look... brown in S2
03Aurora told me that she told you to disable it
BUCKAROO WAZZAP
03but apparently youd idn't listen LOL
10dari
10do it
SAY WAT.
03but yeah
the are brown?
lol
06she never told me to get rid of it nor disable
10BAKALOO
Like fragile tiny shells
12drf
12i don't think you intentionally annoyed anyone
Drifting in the foam
12your personality was just unlikeable
12XD
03well yeah
03but then people are all
06i know DRF, i never wanted to annoy you in the first place xd

mfw I just saw that episode
!030
03and when we do talk about it,e veryone's in agreement that they suck :P
03speaking of which

ATlA?
Reptile?
Avatar the last airbender
06o.o
03HP discontinued the TouchPad and made them $100
03instead of $500
oooooh
13!espeon
4Doc Brown PUNCH!
03so I was like DO WANT and bought two
KIACK
Where's Reptile?I don't see him!
03I would have gotten more, but it was a limit of two per person LOL
XD
Luckily, aliens have balls too!
dat truck
03and see
BANZAI!
03Office Depot is sold out again
03so I HOPE they can actually ship mine :/
03though hmm
03what I could do
03is just go to the store
OUTRUN A TRUCK,LIKE A BAWS
This scene totally doesn't reference terminator I & II
We totally need Mortal Kombat: Annihilation in here sometime
03as they said that they'll match the price of officedepot.com
Barry1: "Buccaroo" in a terrible accent
03which has the $149.99 for the 32GB
HELICOPTER OUT OF NOWHERE
MK:A was good in my opinion.
BUKALOO BANZAI
16GB is the $100 I suppose
03yeah
Not bad
bakayarou banzai
dat Commodore 64
03so I got the 32GB for $150
03times two
03I'll probably just sell one to somebody

64GB of tablet storage xD
03and keep the other
6FUCKAYOU IMHAI
Ghosties,YES PLZ
G-Cipher? It's just that easy.

Huh, another season of Zero no Tsukaima.
Hahah
Dem Johns
i cant stand shiva
03mainly just trying it out
hey its that dude from Jurassic Park
In b4 cybernetic killing machine
03why would I actually *need* a tablet if I have a laptop
Same idea here :P
03that's why I can't understand why anyone would actually want an iPad
03I mean
03those things are like $600
03you can get a laptop for $300 now
03laptops have more storage andw ay more featurtes...
03*features
03but I mean hey
03getting a $600 tablet for $150? Sure
I think that is why the tablet failed in 2003~ xD
(lol Casper)
03if they had iPads for $150 I'd buy a bunch and then sell them to fanboys
:P
whoever it was they are pro trolls
Either way, they'll fall for it
03that's the idea
I didn't fight Reptile in the first MK since i never got far because of the goddamn diffuculty.
03incidentally, my friend does the same thing with cars
03he buys used cars and sells them, makes money
Lemons,it was Orson Welles.
Two accidents in a row
How
dat shot
03LOL
03no?>
03only the one accident
ahh ok
03and my friend was like "You should just sell that before it completely breaks down"
Is this Goonies or Buckaroo Banzai?
Haha
03apparently the blue-book value is like $5000
