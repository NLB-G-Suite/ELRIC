samurai champloo must be mentioned if cowboy bebop is mentioned
*wonders if there is a roger smith pony yet*
0Should I click it!?
I still can't help but wonder if this show would be better without the giant fighting robots
0i didnt like champloo
0tbh
Big O: Mecha are Magic
cumfy*
4Samurai Champloo doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as the legendary Cowboy Bebop
12I bid you adieu, gentlecolts. Til next time.

0theyre pretty good
4My personal preference means that despite being made by the same crew, it doesn't mean it's just as good
Samurai champloo is cool and all.

Car needs to be electrified.

Why did I think this guy looked like jet?
Eh samurai champloo was good plain and simple
it's been a long time since i've watched any anime
i kinda miss it
Cowboy Bebop is better though.
0so, has anyone made a party and bullshit pmv yet?
0you gotta share

What, you don't think it matched the hype?
0you gotta care

Besides, I don't think it was THAT hyped

IS THIS BUCKAROO BONZIA?
4Oh, let's see...
Then again I haven't finished any anime ever I think...
....

HI ALFRED

As a little clue look up "Big O Notation"
Well bronies, my shitty video game movie is loaded and I now bid you farewell and sweet dreams.

I love how completely bored she looks while she falls.
The robots are big.

I'm beginning to think giant robots are common around here...
I absolutely love how the robots work in this show.
What do you think? lol
MINT GETTING RAPED
yeah, like that building getting blown up, that was a clue for "there's a giant mother fucking robot"
They're not fast or agile or stupidly acrobatic
04That name kills people </drf>
04I think yes |P
rodo raep
04I mostly stick around TST forums for the DRP, but I do post in some discussions every now and then.

If you find yourself feeling attracted to the ponies in a way that makes you feel uncomfortable, you're not the only one... but resist the urge to tell everyone you meet about it
Exactly.

04So go deal with it
I know. Wish they had been able to do 3...
05Drake I don't need to deal with it
/me hides

Yeah.
DragonRage, we require addition squaddies.

im positive the new game is going to suck
We definitely will if it's a Snakeman base I'm raiding.
@edmar, yeah it was cool the community was great too

It probably will, Shiggy, but I'm willing to give them a chance.

0i like blue bells

Let me think for a minute...
rarity is best pony
0and lyra
0and bonbon

Rarity is best pony. She can get Dash dressed up all frou frou-y in ten seconds flat.
Agreed, Shiggy
12herp
fav Background pony is lyra... i likes lyra...
Out in the cold all this time.

Secretly lurking in plain open sight in the user list. :p
Getting cold outside now. :/
this material is safe, this material is useful, and rarity is the best pony ever

Oh gods, a chrysalid

0DARI GO GO GO GO GO
I still want to do fanfic, but doubt I will despite coming up with a much better idea for one.
One where I know at least of the characters very well.
lol I was just saying yesterday I was supprised no one did Banana phone with ponies yet.
Doesn't matter, shit don't work anyway
Nani
Shutup I'm doing it.
It can at least stay connected, and that's all I need it for.
It's also a million lines shorter than using POE so that's cool.
POE DOESN'T FUCKING WORK.
I'M NOT USING POE.

Something else you should keep in mind
He won't die, even if you kill him.
kill who...
is it anything like farmville?
0its like harvest moon more
0it was on the mainpage a while back
0well the status update anyay
0*anyway
i've come to the realization much to the dismay of a few select people that alot of the good shipping fics i've read have ahd and OC or a fan named character, like when the mane six are involved the romance is usually rushed and poorly thoughtout *not to mention cheesy*
... Plus a question mark somewhere in there
12:o
12http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=ENjmYTB1Ee0 ;D
12:D
0which ones are you reading?

except for twiluna pics, thouse are usually well paced
fics*
0also heres lauren and her animation team in pony costumes
0http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/08/fim-animators-cosplaying-as-ponies.html

50 CONNECTIONS A SECOND

YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH

Party on Luka 3's connections.

12i don't get it
I don't know, but So Long, and Thanks for all the Ponies sure is.
0i dont like sad stories

cute shippy ending though...its only sad for a bit
/me goes back to reading past sins
0oh ok then :D
0whats that 425 page long one?
blues X derpy

03^
Something like that yeah 18chapters so far

0oof
Been trying to take the whole fanfic thing slowly. I tend to be a bit picky when it comes to what i read.
same here
that being said I think I have read all of 3 =p
12!kyu
/me 7does a barrel roll! ._.      |:      .-.      :|      ._.
i was the same way sumica and still am...boy have i stopped reading a fic half way manytimes cus of how bad it was...god especially mane sixshipping its all rushed
But
One that must have been some what poor as the name eludes me past sins and cross and arrow.
but D:
12hi
!Umbreon
12noooo
thats why i dont read ships that much anymore
/me is not owned by Umbreon and never will be! |D
naw some good ol chopin will probably do it
Chopin's bitchin.
there was a ongoing twiluna fic i really liked...which i hope updates soon...
indeed
nope
Sometimes I don't know if it's just random smashing keys or actual music though
last ship i read that i enjoyed was this one fluttershy/luna fic
I have also taken up the habet of keylocking my pc as well I dont think I have closed Eqd or the list of fics I am thinking of reading for around 3 weeks.
i think i know which one your talking about...if only because there is only one lunashy fic on eqd
chopins music is never random :p
/me is not owned by Umbreon and never will be! |D
personally i prefer bachs counterpoint the best
people wonder why, idk i just like counterpoint
12i must be hated ;-;
really?
yeah actually
Hnn I don't hear much of bach often
hm
now ships i hate..... TWIXIE GAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
NEED A MOMENT?
lyra and octavia, sorry shes married
Anyone else noticing less and less scootabuse? in the last few weeks/
thats good
i perfer her to be hero worshipping dash
0octavia is married?
....lyra....
0she is?!?
its fanon....
0to who?
and i was kinda saying it as a joke
/me waits for the joke
bon bon
Bonbon
er yeah
XD
0oh i love bon bon
0:D
Lyra x Bon Bon is the only legitimate lyra ship.
yup
0only real one
Lyra amuses me cause she likes to photo bomb alot of shots.
You know, because they were seen together in almost every scene that had them in the show.
0i love lyra
0omg
0in boast busters when the ursa shows
0bon bon doesnt have a cutie mark
shipping anyone of the mane six to vinyl ihate (also i adore lyra as well being my fav bg pony)
especially ones where she is grinning like a crackhead in the background.
It makes you wonder whether she is like that all the time, or knows when the camera is present.
i play bachs music all the time at church
pinky sense perhaps?
lol
a natural star.
0lyra breaks the 4th wall
i loves lyra
and yes I use Lyra for my icon on eqd.
I want to use Lyra.
and after feedback i adore vinyl soooo much
but I haven't decided yet.
0i dont have an eqd account D;
She seems underappreciated as far as pony icons go
You'll need one to post anything.
me neither
0true
And anyway, I come from places on the internet where there are only accounts, so I feel more comfortable having one.
0who else loves blue bells?
yeah it's kinda odd though you have to use a phone to set up a google account.
...?
0blue bells
I found making a Blogger account easiest. The only thing you need to give it is your email, and then just exit when it asks you to name your blog.
0runs the music shop in ponyville
When in the series was that?
0cutie mark something or another
oh and if you want to see the icon I used. http://miburl.com/j99Dpb
0i think
0ill find him
since i cant draw my ponysona will probably never see light of day, but u guys got one?
Havent realy tryed to flesh one out personaly.
nope.avi
I'm ruminating on the possibilites. Would you illuminate?
thought about marks but never settled on one.
(brohoof if you got that reference)
0hunter pounce
mine would be a quill
aladin
hence the username :P
I think
Easy one. *brohoof*
any of yall have a skype, it'd be cool to keep in touch
Your pony would be a quill? How interesting.
I do.
sleep time
yes me and my pony self wish to be a writer
I thought about architect tools as I am a draftsman but I am also a cook so go figure.
ugh, got disconnected
hee maybe a mix of both ^^
my skype name is creed9294
I used to have a bunch of pianists on iTunes but I totally lost it all
my problem is thought I can draw anything organic forth a damn. Plans no problem but yeah.
cool, thats understandable
0i dont know how to use skype D;
finished that fanfic
its simple
... ADORABLE
So defnatly would use a template if I ever tried to make one. and no dont have skype
did prince ever come back?
My pony would have a chess piece as a cutie mark (probably a knight), as I have a passion for designing . . . things (e.g. abstract strategy game, collectible card games, musical instruments. . . I mean, I'm even going to school to be a chemical engineer).
\:D/
its real simple hunty its just like aim, cept you can mic talk and video chat
Which FlutterHi?
r.r
Anyway, my skype is soltha
my pony would have a couch as his cutie mark
hah
because that is what my life revolves around
William Forte?
Oh I do use steam though.
Could the couch be potato-e?
yeah bro thats me
0potato lump
my hands smell like weed >.>
don't even know why
just a couch
well obviously they're made of weed
no other possibility
:D
EAT THEN
then, them
either works.
couches and quills eh? wasn't that one in an ep
You could sell couches.
Yes. Owls well that ends well.
that's right
eeyup
0ahah omg yes :D
did prince dari ever return?
i think i would develop a plush couch
oh that reminds me I need to check what hubs showing today.
0my cutie mark would be... (IDENTITY CRISIS) OMG BRB D:
No. And I don't even know what is left to stream.
@FlutterHi

0lets stream dot and the kangaroo
0OMG I LOVE FEED BACK <3
heee
seee i told ya its great, you finsih reading both chapters?
Oh I guess sence we were on the topic of marks for a bit. What type of pony?
pegasis
0halfway done with one
normal pony
0BUT ITS SO WELL WRITTEN :S{O
vinyl blind should be fanon
0i want to be a pegasis
0i cant stand being told what to do
what fic?
heh
0i hate limitations too
All of the normal ponies are normal.
i left the link a bit of ways up, its called feed back, and its a vinyl scratch ziggy stardust shipping fic, thats dear to my heart
i would be a normal normal pony
the Ditzy doo one?
I would almost definitely be a unicorn (not by choice).
i would have a ponytail mane and i still have not decided upon a mane or coat color...
i have really long hair
oh there it is way up, was alomst off my log.
lol good you found it
/me adds it to the pile.
My hair is kind of curly (like ringlets), about 10 inches long

0damnit dari
0i need to read this
Custom Vinyl! Woo!
0stop tempting me with new post D;
*eyes brighten*
I imagine I would be in neutral shades.
Would like the whole Pegasis thing but probably would not fit with a craftsman....crafstpony?
ehhh
why should personal decisions have to coincide with pony type?
There were construction pegasi in Cloudsdale. It probably wouldn't be too far off.
*nods* yeah
Speaking of which, what was that jack hammer even supposed to do?
They can manipulate clouds with their hooves.
*pony shrug*
name?
what i loved about that part was when the construction worker went *those wings are gorgeous* because he did it in a perfect new york accent *im from newyork*
0its ponies they dont gotta explain shit
Okay fine. Don't answer my question.
huh?
it was a little vauge sorry
You know a friend of mine at work has one of those 3d printers I should totally get bring him in to the herd and then make my own ponies with it =p
were you asking about pony sona names?
Cual seria tu nombre? (I hope I didn't botch that conjugation)
jah
i have been struggleing with that to be honest, i think i just want to stick to the name Quill but ki dont know if that sounds too bland...
i completely lost track of this conversation
/me goes to spanish dictionary to check. . .
We're talking about our ponysonas.
Would have to stick with Sumica I have been using it for so long no clue on a full name.
hehe yeah
12Paint STILL doesn't let me zoom in as much as I need to. >_>
i'll probably end up shipping my sona to dash, being the horrible fan boy that i am :P
lol
It isn't too bland if you've read Last Man Standing.
ahh
lol, ive spent the last 20 minutes watching some funny ass playthrough of Amnesia
0name?
0what name?
0what do you mean name?
0idgi?
Yeah I don't think I could ever ship my self.

...who is into the sock meme... i have read a disturbing fic by butterscotch sundae about teh socks and now... it makes me cringe
I thought it would be quite clear, since I can see it so well from here
Holy lag.

k/w/e
well my two best decks are my pure black agro and my green white mana ramp beatdown
so i mostly like black and green
it's not much better than a R4 tho
but i have a few decks so colors are not really a problem for me
im just bad with blue is all
03whatever
03some of the CGI looks really good
03like Celebi's evil nest
0yeah that one broke my arm and left me in an alley with half my belongings and set fire to the rest of them
I had a lot of fun recently with a Kudoltha Rebirth deck my friend (who is the one with all of the cards) set up. I mostly play red and green though.
03it looks a lot better to me
03than a DVD
0so yeah, fuck girls
0no offense sotha
As I said, I am horrible with pure blue, but red/blue is great.

Red green too
03all we can get
03I mean, yeah, it's still a bit upscaled
like whit
anything can be resized to any resolution.
03but it looks better than that Blu-Ray of movies 5 and 7 I think XD
1080i means what again?
who's?.... hrnnnn
03interlaced?
Ah
Ewww
WTF?
M7 BD > M4 TS

It's okay. We pretty much finished with it.
I was big in to magic at one point but the card games now just leave me with a bit of huhwah.
anyway
huhwah?
huh+what
in other words a stupid look of i don't get it on my face.
oh okay.
I just have a passion for games (though that mainly applies to board games). I am currently in various stages of designing a spy-themed card game, which is looking pretty cool with what little progress I have made on it so far.
nice
So what do you all do for a living if any thing?
0im a medic
also: a tbs strategy table top game based on a hex grid, an economics themed board game, and various abstract strategy games.
0US army medic
I'm going to school to be a chemical engineer. That's as far as I've gotten so far.
0going to be a doctor when i get out
Oh yes, finally got it to work
TBS strategy was a tad redundant. I apologise. Let's sing the S O N G C A M P F I R E Song now!
well i am going through collage to learn the trade of writer, i am hioping to make something peopkle will enjoy but i guess thats what most writers hope :)

Basically, "Press enter to send text"
0write my little pony friendship is magic! that should be a good idea

Well I was a draftsman back in LA but when I moved to vegas I decided to try being a Chef.
fuck yeah, IPv6 rdns working
and dinner
0hows being a chef going?
04You have dinner early.
04Cya
Just go back in time. I mean, considering how screwed up the Whole Sort of General Mish-Mash is, it shouldn't be too difficult.
I like it. Besides it alws me to tolorate being around a computer at home.
But then again, it shouldn't be too difficult to get to Equestria either if we go off of that premise, so...
0thats good, what do you work as? like position?
Working on a computer all day for a living made me not want to be near one at all for play.
0460kb/s
04kill me
0tell me about it

I hope Quill is drafting some sort of HUGE response to this.

Lauren Faust is a super hero after all.

04How do you LIVE
my bloody bro ate all my bandwidth
I write poetry, but find it difficult to write stories and other things.
04._.
03LOL
What was realy cool was back in school I ended up having to do a report on a chef of my picking. Well I always love iron chef even as a kid. so i wrote Masaharu Morimoto for more infomation about him.
0super hero :D
ooooh Yes Masaharu Morimoto
original Iron Chef is best Iron Chef.
0hey speaking of which, how did you people get into ponies?
He was so flattered that he flew me out to new york to interview him in person and try out his favorite meals
wow
really?
yeah
That is amazing.
I now have more respect for him.
HOW
.-.
/me steps on Chime
yes
now dinner
03:<
03k
Youtube got me hooked it kep poping up in my recomended videos the pmv's and such. so after watching a few I decided to check out the eps
0nice
0brb
Nu
Also
0theres silent hill fog outside
/me squish
0and I MUST GO KILL BAT THINGS
mind you I did it in the dead of night in the dark with every one asleep.
0and get raped by pyramid head
heh
Original Iron Chef is pretty good, but dammit, I like Mario Batali too much to say the original series is better.
And I don't remember what prompted me to first start watching the show, but I do recall I just sat down and watched everything that was out over the course of about 3 nights.
how i got into ponies...well mine was not really to special
this was the first pmv I ever saw.
Well, I was drawn into FiM by a couple different sources. In the only chat I really spent much any time on regularly pre-event, there was a particular person who made ponified pictures of various video game and movie characters, which got me interested because they looked amazing, but for some reason, I never checked it out.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Tjb14VoWjg
Sleep
Night
/me sleeps under Drake's foot :P
ah the whole meme's made me do it?
And then, in a different forum I'm a part of, a thread called "Twenty Percent Cooler" popped up for pony-meme images and stuff, which I found funny, and became more interested. And then when I was skyping one of my friends from said forum, he asked me who my favourite pony was, and since I couldn't answer him until I actually looked into it . . .
I had been asking my self for months before I even was geting the yt videos what is up with all the ponies
. . . I watched the first episode, and then the second, and so on. And then I found EqD.
ahh the anthology, i love that vid
And my heart, mind, life, and soul were all officially taken over by pony.
eqd was easy enough for me to find, the friend s i told you about and their roomates all love the show, so yeah it was pretty easy to become hooked,
I think that vido is one of the best ways to get people hooked or at least get them started down the path.
I never watched the whole thing.
it's realy well done.

after all this time on the fandom...a question still elludes me...why in the hay do sooo many people like trixie!!!! my god i just find her so...damn ANNOYING... okay im done now, she is cute though...
partly cause I watched somthing called AMV hell
I dont mind her when she dosent have the whole I am great act going one.
Like some one said tonight she dosent seem bad without the hat and cape.
which is the whole time she was in the episode...
that would be me...
like i said... she is cute
I think the majority of ponies who like her like her for the personality the fandom created for her, rather than her in-show one.
could be, then again the community at large seems to be shaping alot of the show.
I think that has to do with the fact that there right now is no show.
I said shapeing not shiping mind you.
well derpy for example.

12!Pokemon
Vaporeon, you are a 8Doduo.
i have never read a fic with her in it, so my view on how she is in the fadom would be...skewed
12!pokemon
12:3
12fire :D
12Typhlosion <3
12I'm warm to sleep on. XD
neather have I but I ment more of the looks of derpy went from a one time animation glitch at the start of the show.
12XD
/me is sleepy
was fine for 12 or so eps then became the crosseyed version as part of canon.
hm
I mean, that as there is no source material to work from, the community is self-propagating the effects it is having on the direction it is taking everything, and hopefully this should be reined in a little (ha ha reined in) when S2 airs.
ah yeah I see what you meen
whhich is soon i hope...i've run out of fan fics i actually like...and im starting to go insane...
7good.
Chalk it up to artistic licensing.
12That's good :)
brb
I just hope that they don't modify the show because of things in the fan community to any extent greater than they have with Derpy. And they could have Lyra and Bon bon together, and so on.
7I like pickles.
Yeah i like it more as shoutouts to the fans in the background.
12Pickles taste good
just little details.
Pickles.
nothing that actually changes the show.
still might be intersting to see BG ponies get a line from time to time. Or atleast not be background such as lyra and bonbon in the parasprites one.

much better. Thank you
i am a very very romantic person, while i was not a fan of shipping ponies at first i read some fics and liked them...but like i said...ship fics with the mane six and each other are usually rushed and or badly written
!digimon
So what brings you here at this time of the day... what ever time it is for you.
12!Pokemon

/me RUNS
The only thing you can sue for is pain and suffering.
0Switching to civilian colors. Anyways, I was just around, thought I'd stop in.
There was a bit of shiping in cross and arrow....ok alot of shipping and well it was strange.
Which would be kind of difficult to prove I guess.
mostly cause it was rule 63 shipping.
im sure it was, i hate when in a romantic kind of story that the romance gets rushed its like ooh i like her, then ooh i like you too = end result = boring

ooooh so you read a lime...

Oh right I recall the first one I read now. It had a rushed ending. AJ and Dash swaped roles for a day.
Having one of my organs not function properly isn't suffering?
0ok nvm i dont got it

That is why you can't see anything. There is nothing there.
When you wake up, you will be in another world.

How is that not suffering?

Hey. This is no laughing matter.
I didn't have parents, I was put up for adoption
Parents defined by
the woman whose vagina you passed out of
and male who fertilized the egg.
It is interesting how often the topic/concept of going to Equestria seems to come up in chats and discussions.
Single parents need not apply.
Yes, and I was given up for adoption on the spot
0i have a skype
oki give me a few to get signed up and such
0but i dont know how to use D;
So often casually, but still.

OH GOD

YFW I'm always here...
We've unleashed an unspeakable evil upon the internets
He said this:
Haha yep. There are trixie and fluttershy ones too. Cereal posted it primarily as a joke. I'm not sure if is do more Hah. Sent from my phone! Ignore the typos!
ohai Dashite, mfw you're afk though sometimes
so what he say, Rodman
Hi Dashite
oh that's what he said?
...there's trixie and fluttershy?
link
^^^^^thats what he said
Pfft. I'm here almost as much as Dari.
It seems so, though I've been unable to find them
and dari is also afk half the time. you're not HERE here, so why be here?
Dari actually has his colour kicking script to keep, so he has a reason
Because it's easier to just leave mIRC running than it is to start it up again all the time?
i can't find them either Rodman
start it up? just go to bronystate.co.cc
My little Metro?
I don't use the website except to watch the stream.
I don't think I've seen that one

Except I'm moving to the dorms, but that will take little time and the stream starts after the time I'd do anything related to that
I might ask silverscreen if I can play my versions (i have extended) with commentary on and post some super duper neato trivia!
04Probably not
Oh nice!
well i think 7PM EST
i must ask him though, he may want to do trivia on his own (Which would mean only IMDB trivia, and not super duper neato commentary trivia)

waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
Beat them then
sorry i love freakouts!
i'll view latorz
; )
and we just played rummi, and i wiped the floor xD
04Stupid goddamn router
doesn't help i was educated in UK and did /very/ well adn they were all raised in Spain with it's crap educational system . : ( sadface
basicaly UK > Spain for education. this is fact. i was in spain a few years myself, before UK
what bout you? where are you in life? school? job?
04...
04wat
XD
Drake
I'm sooooooo sad
I'm still trying to decide
What I'll do when Reminiscence is finished
;-;
06marry drake, get children, and die happily after 60 years
/me RUNBS
Lol
and ohai EspyLacopa
Me? University
1 year of Chinese, and about to start 4 in career
Drake != Reminiscence
04no
04just
04no
And dear God, finally I finished that hell
04>|
imo characters of Reminiscence are so much better than its plotline
nice! i wish i could speak chinese
but its plotline is also somewhat interesting
I think
uhm.....xie xie?
04premise is good
premise? lol
xi ne quae le or something?
04execution leaves some things wanting
lmfao
Why are you thanking me?
04...ignore the grammar
XD
thanking? i said NICE cuz that's awesome!
oh right
sorry i don't know chinese
i was just quotinga ll i knew xD
I really can't tell what you're seeing without tones placed ontop of the words
Thats the kicker
<Drake> execution leaves some things wanting
what'd you mean by that though? :p
sowwee
Four tones: One steady and neutral, one quick and hard, one rising but slow, and one continuously low
04The execution of the plot leaves you wondering what the hell happened
you know yer Chinese =]
04And the basic setting of it is rather...lackluster
04Swords in the futute/modern day?
It's kinda disorganized I know >:
plotholes left and right
that's why I'm going to rewrite it
so therefore I have another 2 yaers
ears
years
04ears
I tell you, I can read a story (somewhat) and understand whats going on, and make an essay on agriculture
04wow
.____,.
04that
04just
But I can't speak worth a damn because nobody understands me
04I don't know what to say really
:V
shut up
Anyway
imo the stuff that goes on mightn't make sense
but most of it should
at least the non-basic stuff
04Yeah
: /
04Seran gets turned, Lyon angsts, The Kommander, Hensh and all the DMs are annoying manipulaters and deadpan snarkers
lol oh good morning

MORNIN RobotPinkie !!

lmfao
I'm alright, you?
04Ohey, if you're quiet, you can hear my sister and mother yelling at each other!

<Drake> Seran gets turned, Lyon angsts, The Kommander, Hensh and all the DMs are annoying manipulaters and deadpan snarkers

04XD
06no
06i don't even...
write a mind game fic between Rathicus and Kommander Kulesz
or Rathicus and The Hensh
:D
04Oh yes
...I'm not even sure if I could tolerate that.
Drake actually
04hEH
04No one's actually read how he talks actually
That's why we both read it
04except people in the DRP
er

04and that's not a very good representation of it
I write The Hensh
???

This chat is now about the unanimously appointed new best pony http://www.glogster.com/media/7/40/13/47/40134706.jpg
who, http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/4.jpg ?
lol
This will not end well!
lol, i always just pick another pony and say IT'S the best one, but really I like them all :3
So were there any clips where you'd like the characters isolated from the BG?
not really, but haven't looked really. Why, you want to vector aginz?
Yeah, though I think I'm gonna amend my "mane 6 is best pony" to "all ponies but blueblood, snips and snails are best pony"
true dat
also, why the Gilda hate? D:
I dunno, either vector or cut out?
We don't have to do anything this weekend, really :P
Gilda is worst griffon
no u ziltoid
NOPE
Ziltoid is a griffon?
Yes
ziltoid worst griffon :D
No
Gilda is also best griffon.
Helps that she's the only griffon.
^
lol
Well, that's true...
How was BMN last night?
very fun
Goonies was good until I fell asleep and got a power outage... not sure which order it happened in :P
: /
06can someone try now please?
sadface, RobotPinkie
/me now belongs to Espeon for 16 minutes, and floofs up in Espeon's lap :3
06s
Eh, I'll have to be there tonight
Did they announce anything special?
06:3
yes
and do you know about next week's LOTR marathon?
06of course, when Skylands does it it'll become "Skylands's" but this is an improvement anyway :P
Yup
06thanks alot!
today during lotto 6 draws will be had to determine the 2 per night FIM episodes
Guess I dint get picked for mod lol
04o-o
Also they announced silence for about 5 minutes, not sure what that was about. :P
they're only announcements, other than 'still looking for mods' and 'if you could stream season 2 contact us'
o-o
/me hugs back
ziltoid you had an interview?
lol Xeli
yeah
Orly? what was it like how'd it go?
06someone else try it now please :P
I did awful
/me still belongs to Espeon for 15 more minutes, because there is still Umbreon floof in Espeon's lap >.>
if ($right($nick,1) == s) { blah blah blah $nick $+ ' }
And terrible at everything
Well thats the impression I got
What? They had a quiz or something?
D: how so?
yea what did they do / ask?
I dont know if I should say
I guess not, lol
Ill keep it a secret
06makes sense
spoilers cupcakes
yea actually it would be a possible unfair advantage
04I want
04to kill my sister now
ohey RobotPinkie were you also applying for a position as a moderator?
Not yet
04And no that wasn't my sister
I might if they don't get enough, I guess?
not yet? :P
you so should :3
lol I dunno, I've been a mod before in various places
where?
That would be telling, and then you could trace me down :P
aww cmon :( ok then
i don't even care about anything like dat lol.
lolol not on anything big, communities about this size
i have once moderated 'alphagamers,' a videogame livestream
Also ran my own message board for a while
136 castlemain avenue, bournemouth, dorset, England. =]
i'm 17 male Spanish
there
i don't givea =]
haha
oh name
lolol
Darío Montes - Rodriguez. Nick: Daz
i actually am considering changing bronystate name to Daz, but ppl might forget i am Dman :(
It's not even that, it's just nothing major that I've been a mod on. The only big thing about being a mod is you get to be in on the secret chats/forums
i suppose
It's not like... a major change from anything

lol or well some mods have a LOT of secret chats...
02*WB03(Ray03)02WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
well, from what i've seen, here it's all aobut keeping steam / fb updated, rules kept here, money issues for website, streaming of course, and i guess you get to have colours
02Annnd... I just woke up .-.
saw dat in EQD iltoid - would NOT watch
Ziltoid *
Saw what?
I am very scared
021:40pm ... this what I get for going to sleep at 4am
06ohai Ray
the picture i saw before, RobotPinkie, and lol Ziltoid
02Hiii~ Light
06TF2 is ready, but i may be off soon
06iPad it's home button broke >:
02D:
06going to get a new one, already got the insurance papers here
02ah, I see
Yeah it disappeared for me...
ack! RobotPinkie what browser you use?
02well, I just woke up. but meh I'd play anyways
02Just tell me when you want to play :P
Firefox right now
until I get themes to work in Chrome :P
ah. well, in chrome this extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nonjdcjchghhkdoolnlbekcfllmednbl?hc=search&hcp=main means that NOT ONE PICTURE EVER has disappeared for me
Yeah cant even see what I posted
...RobotPinkie, get chrome right now, and i'll try to help if you want ^_^
Ziltoid, i can : ( get chrome and that extension right there
I dont like Chrome
Um, I just want pony themes, but I can't switch between them in Chrome...
okie then
There's no theme switcher yet
and RobotPinkie you can, so uh yea, but eh u can stick with firefox ; )
yea there's no 'switcher'
but you can reobtain the themes to switch. takes 2 seconds
i don't actually mind which you use, just a little upset that people often see images disappear and I dont :(
Naw, links get deactivated once a theme is installed
hmm. works for me. ah well =]
soo what you gunna do till movie night? gonna go out or something?
It switches from "download" to "already installer" or something
Not sure, maybe I'll watch some ponies... or style Pinkie? :P
yea RobotPinkie but if you install another one that one will be back again. i think.
and style!!1
It's not for me, that's what annoys me...
Because I installed my favorite theme first, then installed a bunch of others thinkin I could switch :P
They've added theme switching to the testing branch, though, so I'll switch fairly soon.
for now I'm stuck here in firefox land, missing half the images in bronystate :P
ah okie
well i dunno wat do today : /
also viewing amnesia now! : D
lets play or?
the one u linked the freakouts =]
BAH BAAAAH BAHBAAH

FFFUUUUU
You got it Ziltoid.

How?
So when do I find the BFG in Amnesia?
preorderin' darksiders II i believe
Oh cool
I preordered Space Marines
oh okie
that's how I got early access to the demo<
:>
I should look more into 40k lore because from what ive heard everything is fucking bananas
Looking forward to Darksiders 2 a whole lot
I wub the first one
i read a little warhammer 40k lore. it is lulzy
ʎʇıʌɐɹƃ ƃuıʎldɯı<
Wut.
lawl, Dmann
>implying gravity back to normal
same, RobotPinkie.
:3
ack, GGgala! sorry, internet derped so dmann
I got Darksiders for free when I preordered Space Marines
ah that was it!
and I LOVED it.
want 2, then, Dermathil ?
aaaand back
I wonder how the Darksiders about Famine will be.......
I mean War, Death and Conquest I can see
i just meant the upside down text was lol, but ok!
darksiders 2 WiiU i'm looking forward to. hatersgonnahate.
yes I do Dmann
Dman again man
Dermathil, my bro, just type 'dm' and hit TAB
a
Darksiders 2 will be best on the PS3, silly.
:P
I'm a PC game
*gamer
it is so weird that a new 3d Legend of Zelda is coming out for the Wii just as the Wii's replacement is about to come out. It's like Twilight Princess and the GameCube all over again
You play as death in DC2 right?
Yep Ziltoid
DS2 derp
oh wait, DC?
RobotPinkie, WiiU has graphical capabilities > PS3. I ain't saying durr nintendofanboy look we're better, it HAS been 6 years since last homeconsole, but yea, wiiu if done rite can have better graficx
lol
yeah, I like the Wii U's prospects better than the 3DS
I'm not sure Wii U has better graphical capabilities, but okay.
i do too!
'durr controller is spaz' no u! all ps and xbax controllers the SAME! ERRY ninty controller always different, and always works :3
I hear it's pretty much on par with 360 and PS3 since the controller will cost a lot to manufacture
RobotPinkie: the iPhone has better graphics capabilities than the ps3 at this point. believe me, it will
eh i ain't buying yet, gonna see what's actually for it
lol fanboys
doesn't mean the ps4, or xbox 720, won't blow Wii U out of the water in turn
Ohai everypony!
GGgala, in graphics yes
If you want to say iPhone has better graphics capabilites than 360 or PS3, than provide a link :P
but to be honest, GGgala, it's all about style and gameplay now, cuz graphics are so good
lolwut
then, even
PEGACORN!
Gameplay over graphics
^
^

Truth
I WIN THE GAME!
I lost.

Dman.

big kahuna or something
/me sees Pegacorn come at this city on his motorcycle. Pegacorn steps off, and approaches him.
pretty sure it was bigkhunabuger
You know, even if he did get one of my vitals, I'd have still been able to return fire if I wanted
I had burgers two days ago
or well, one anyway...
http://bigkahunaburger.net

Are we talking about a Yugioh 5Ds movie, or a Yugioh 5Ds game on the 3DS?

Oh, the movie they're talking about, I aw it

D2 was really good
What does that have to do with Yugioh?
D? I dunno, it wasn't as good as some other FMV games, but I liked the mood.
It has everything to do with everything!
Oh, TVtropes has put a funny spin on Labyrinth Wall in the Duelist Kingdom anime

oh well
"lemme lay sumin fresh on ya" "Yea, jaden- you're not black-"
It says that the way7 it works, which is essentially turning a card game into a dungeon crawler is like saying that playing an ace of spades in poker has everyone play chess for the next hour
lol
lol!
/me rewatches 'sigo aqui' :P
?
My favourite scene in any video media ever created.

brb
Great movie
one complaint: no ponies
7I'm hoping you're correct about what you're saying and that I'm not misunderstanding it.
alien ponies from space?
Damn, now I need to watch that movie again
i watch this movie at least once a month, i can't get bored of it. the story is so simliar ot mine i resonate with it very well, and that obviously helps in making it my favourite movie. I love the music, still laugh at it's jokes, and every watch reminds me of everything that's ever happend in my life. Yea, it's my fave movie
what?
RobotPinkie i was thinking of making it a movie choice but some may get bored
also >implying i'll ever get picked
7By saying 'god', you imply that Espeon has idled for an absurdly long amount of time, right?
wat?
lotto >_<
why would they get bored tho?
ghosties has had 2 picks so far lul
I don't see why people would get more bored with that than... say... Spider's Web
and GGgala eyedunno guss i'm shy about it?? :P
I mean really
hi, GG
Well.
hey Barry (assuming that meant me?)
on another server
yes, it did
but it's a great movie....
Soon you'll be afraid to admit that Scoot Scootaloo is best pony!
^_^
and nah, silly, twi best pony
oh wait in this argument i had chosen rarity! shoops
I knew it...
Rarity best pony then :3
Silly Dman, that's not how you spell Pinkie Pie!
umb dinternet
Fluttershy is best
applejack best pony
Silly Barry, that's now how you spell Applejack!
Fluttershy!
....ohshi-
I mean Rainbow Dash, then
06what
Fluttershy!
06@ Quan
Cheerilee?
lol
I can accept that.
shame on y'all! Colgate!
b'sides, everypony knows Luna is best
I guess Rainbow will do as a second choice, with Cheerilee as a third
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/arch/src/130692387579.png
I mean, how is doctor whooves NOT the best?
it's so obviously celestia
huh?
and that's why applebloom is the best pony
i agree with everything Dman just said!
You keep switching between different ponies
GGgala_, ya darn right
Twilestishy Diane Cake is best pony
also best ship
/me comes back to see best pony discussion
this argument is flawless
I'm back.
hey Pegacorn
ohey Ziltoid
Obviously sluttershy is best pony
Okay lets settle this once and for all
Fluttershy*
Wait, you're saying the best ship is Twilight x Celestia x Fluttershy x Pinkie Pie x Mr/Mrs Cake?
nah, it's actually sweetie belle, the derail master
Dash.End.
@pony Best pony
Best pony is Gilda
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Done.
@pony Sluttershy
Gilda not be pony.
So as you can all clearly see, big macintosh is best pony
Prince Blueblood?
imokaywiththis.jpg
NOPE
hell no
Gilda IS cool though,in the same sense that Francis from L4D is cool.
more like worst pony
trolololo
best ship is Rainbow Dash x anyone
yea, RD gets shipped with erryone
Dunno why.
Best pony is everypony except Snips, Snails & Prince Blueblood
second best is Pinkie Pie x anyTHING
dealwithit.jpg
i don't really have ships. i like reading them, they can be cute :3
>except Snips, Snails & Twist
Fixed that for ya!
but no fave shsps me
7Nyanspeon.
>mfw GGgala_ thinks Prince Blueblood is best pony
7Did you see it?
Gilda x Francis anypony?
lol
lololol
/me has fond memories of treasure planet.
>mfw errypony is actually best pony. protip: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/10.jpg It's my face.
Though I'd add Twist and some other ponies to the list of "not best pony"
Francis is best survivor.
>mfw reports on bronies still say we like the show cuz we're all SOB's from 4chan doing it for the irony. http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/125.png :(
all the NICE ponies are best pony
^
06now I did
Hunter is best infected.
yeah and that it's "/b/ + ponies"
How the fuck is /b/ + ponies bronies?
7Okay. :3
RobotPinkie, that's the origin of the word.
Because it has the letter b in it
"they like ponies. they file in to stay off from work to watch a show for girls. they mentally stick. they 4channers. They-" :(
Some say its /b/ + ponies
That's because /b/ usually uses bro as their word.
it's never ever been /b/ + ponies, it's bros and ponies
RobotPinkie: >implying The Great And Powerful TRIXIE is not best pony
Others say its simply bro + ponies
Same way that /co/ were /co/lts
Rodman: it's 2nd one clearly :P
Inorite
Trixie is now a charger.Deal with it.
GGgala_ >implying Trixie is not a nice pony
RobotPinkie: >iimplying she was ever nice
/b/+ponies=/b/ronies. That's how it has been due to the 4chan roots of the fandom.
(the fandom originally formed on co and moved to B. that's how it was.
i remember at one point the term was /co/lts. but bronies took over
If you say so
02well, bbl
02Back in 1 to 4 hours :D
Knowyourmeme article written by bronies state as such.
and Trixie IS nice
(moved to b cuz co banned it, and then b banned it so made ponychan. they 'one thread at a time' rule for co and b)
she just has a bigger ego than Kanye West
she can't help it
Trixie?Nice?Nope.avi
wanttosee trixie season 2
^This
>mfw nintendo 3ds forums now has a pony mode
BYE RAY!!
eyup Dermathil
I'LL MISS YOU! DON'T FORGET YOUR LUNCH!
02BYE LUNAAA
02I ALREADY ATE MY LUNCH D:

Star Trek 2.
okies
I'm a nerd.Deal with it.
i can do that
specifically, the movie's called Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRnSnfiUI54
/me has never seen any Star Trek movie, but has seen endless "Khaaan" references in other things
Many MANY other things.
/me presses his KHAN button
KHAAAAAAAAAAAAN FAUND THEM
from Seinfeld to Family Guy.
And Nostalgia Critic.
The "Khan" thing is funny in the original movie for two reasons. One: Khan can't hear him when he shouts it. and Two: Everything is going according to Kirk's plan, so he has no reason to shout
It's just really stupid
The many wraths of Khan: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfD143wa2qc

"Creating account..."
HI PINKIE PIE.

Uhoh.

brushie!
so how many hours until "Creating account..." goes away?
lol
I think it's more than just ponies
If only I'd sent my account details via Rainbow Dash, it'd be done in 10 seconds flat
Well... G4 ponies...
:3
I concur
Rofl, her hair asploded
The entire team behind FiM is just awesome
7So, might anyone set it to music and upload it on YouTube or whatnot?
06I dunno what you meant with remixing the music though o.o
"Creating account..."? Are you shitting me, Valve?
7Replacing the 'nyan's with, say, the Espeon sound effect from the game. :P
Time for some ponies before I ragequit the internet
FOREVERRRRRRRRRRR
06Lol
still?
ADORABLE PONYTRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIN
Yeah, still
That happened to me when I tried to install steam.
I'm starting to think something is wrong...
Okay shit
Turns out, the account had finished being created before the "Creating account" Thing went away
I'm only watching the last episode tomorrow night
oh my fuck, pouty face rarity :3
I'd rather be a depressive mule during the week than ruin another weekend
Try logging in through the website to see if it's already been created.
okay, RandomExtra, thx
Hallo everyone

Yep, it's already done, thank you so much RandomExtra!
yay~
You're welcome.

Don't tell me....
Dman, this last rarity picture makes me think of a picasso painting
I dunno why
06<3
post eet
unless ur on about mine
your last Rarity picture
My computer wasn't good enough to actually run steam though. I ended up having to uninstall it (Though I am trying again)
: /
well i'm in l4d2 with like 7 fps right now
Not enough space for TF2, FFFF
I've way too many pony pngs, I'm guessing, lol
uhm
lol
...nope, steam just can't see how much space i have...
10GB?
TF2 is 10 fucking gigs? holy jesus
/me is bored
I thought you were playing L4D2?
left a bit ago
as I said, so repeat:, it runs below 10fps for me on this pc
One could say you left it... *puts on sunglasses* ...for dead...
i only have them cuz was 7 quid for l4d2 and 1
YEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
lol oh okay
any other good free to play games?
uh dunno there may be but i might not like them : /. i don't really play much, so just try some out i guess
Whoa that was a crappy bluescreen
might be time to connect my portal 2 copy...
yay
and um AllisZero we're not all watching what you're watching
lol I think he means he BSOD'd
that still happens in windows?
It does, but it's kinda rare in Windows 7 these days
It probably tells me that my overclock isn't as stable as I thought it'd be, is all
Ah okay
Haven't been on Windows much in the last 10 years
oh okie
brb, time to connect my PSN and Steam accounts...
Linux or OSX now?
Gotta log onto work to check my ESX server, I left some large scripts running last night and I'm afraid I crashed my storage box lul
brb
Holy shit, it's still going strong
16 hours and only about 300 GB Copied. This is gonna suck big time when monday rolls by
Hi
"Luna has a Chill Day" ...Ah, the hilarity.
:P
w00t, now I can play Portal 2 with anyone!
300 out of how many?
950
damn, that's almost a terrabyte
Yeah, it's pretty much six years worth of company data
ah
DELETE DELETE DELETE xD
I'm moving it from a... single 5400 RPM 1TB drive to a raid 6 array of 12 drives, 16 terabytes total
wow
It's... painful, yeah
100 people trying to access files at once is not a pretty sight
ouch
Yeah, every night I go to bed in fear that single drive is going to fail
It's all backed up to tape but it's not something I want to go through
MEANWHILE IN PONYVILLE
I'm also watching ponies while Portal 2 installs...
So now I'm on Steam, I feel cooler already
Just realized this feels like Inception
robotpinkie, add meee
I'm on a VM, VPNed into the work network, remote desktop into my machine, using ESX to manage another VM
I'm RobotPika on steam
managing a vm through a vm? o lol
I have weird shit on my computer, I prefer to log onto work from a clean VM :(
lol
Not Pinkie, Pika :P
got it
uhm im not in steam
like the tiny adorable lagomorph that will be extinct in 50 years
ill add u late r:P
pika pika
okay :P

lolol not like Pikachu, like the pika
I'm afraid I can't do that, gentlecoat
I never really was on your side *stab*
Yayayayaya yayaya yayayay
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVJuRgil0wQ
I so want to know what it feels like
RODMAN IS A SPY
To be minding your own business at a traffic light at 2 in the morning
*stab*
And some weird douche pulls up playing Avast Flutterhsy's Ass loud as fuck
Lol
Yayayayayayayayayy
tell him "LOUDER"
lolol are you saying that loud douche is you?
With the pronounciation of pika as Paika, that means that Pikachu is actually pronounced Paikachu
No, I'm the weird douche who's actually playing it is me
well no, Pikachu is something different...
Or was playing it last night
(Fucking pokemon trivia what did you do to me)
what the heck is wapanese?
White Japanese.
oh
1 hour until I can try to play Portal 2.... hope it works on my PC
Why has no-one made a Crysis 2 FIM mod yet
otherwise I can still play with PC users from my PS3, yay!
I think the reason is that it takes too much time, and not enough people are cooperating on projects.
: /
needs more friendship is fighting
02*WB03(Skylands03)02WB* - <Skylands> 10Apparently I saved myself a memo last night titled "cake" and all it says is "I love it so much"
Isn't Crysis one of those games that goes for crazy amounts of realistic detail?
just imagine if those 100 different guys who are trying to make a 3D adventure did something together :P
O lool wow RobotPinkie
yeah pretty much
Pretty much
That would require an organizer of Twilight Sparkle quality to accomplish.
Myup
Aye, but at the same time
hey skylandser
Copyright claims up their asses if anyone tried to be organized about it
or should I say SL
/me flees!
And then you get into. . .*shudder*. . .beuracracy.
I dunno, Hasbro has been very nice about fan creations thus far
10Skylander > SL
sure has ; )
boy am I glad though
Not even the red tape of copywrite claims, but rather internal beurocracy.
That is inherent of having that many people all working together.
Yep
You'd probably have more luck with a smaller team, maybe 4-6 people.
06!shipping
06lag
You need more NEETs with amazing skills, kinda like the japanese do
Need more people who can do 3D assets, most of all...
maybe I should try to do that... Hmmmm
though the guys who are making the online thing have pretty good artists working on it
13!shipping
13LOL
06it's telling us something
...can't watch ponies while Portal 2 is installing... FFFFFFFF-
I'M GONNA LOVE AND TOLERATE THE SHIT OUT OF YOU
best meme
ssh!
the voice speaks to me..
good meme
RobotPinkie ya can't?
You sure you can actually... play portal two too?
Naw, ponies in HD.... install is taking a surprising amount of horsepower
lolol horse
....
the voice...
the voice is a greasy hobo ):
/me runs
lul
Not sure Portal 2 will work, but eh, it's worth a try
that way I won't have to switch to my PS3 to get my fix
Holy fuck Steam is fast to download from.
XD
Yeah, that it is
Also skyyyy
Alright, time to get my hooves dirty
And go paint a picture of fluttershy
searched google images for "best pony", first FiM result that comes up......
http://fim.413chan.net/art/src/129882304302-the-best-pony.jpg
Oh yeah, it's settled, fillies!
Fluttershy
That's not Fluttershy, though I do agree that Fluttershy is one of the best ponies
who drew dat?
just someone?
no clue
Pretty much, it's not very good
but it IS Pinkie
who is also best pony
Well shit, I can recognize Pinkie... it's alright
yes, ALSO and BEST in same sentence :P
lol
Mane 6 is best pony
and close second is CMC
They're all great
/)^3^(\
10Chimewww
but but luna and celestia!
Want to bet Luna is gonna soar in popularity when she appears more often?
She just has potential to be so adorable
YES! i want this to be so
That's true.... Luna is also best pony
not celestia?
Trollestia is best old mare
trollface.jpg
imagine a living breathing world with currency and opinions, and she keeps peace.
she has it hard you know :(
She also has a sharp horn
She's also the most powerful creature in the world, presumably...
hey Ecco!
Greetings Nick and everyone.
>Prince Blueblood
Discuss
You're the voice, try and understand it.. make some noise and make it real..~
.....no :P
Awww
I want to headbutt him
Because Rarity has a crush on him?
Naw, just because he's more self-centered than Trixie
Rarity's crush on him is funny
Oh wait, is this an episode 26 mention?
RobotPinkie: imo she should be as powerful as luna
I haven't watched it yet
IF HE SNOBS RARITY
eh?
I SWEAR I WILL PRINT A CUTOUT OF HIM
AND TAKE HIM TO THE SHOOTING RANGE
No, she has a crush on him since episode 2 :P
or 3, I guess
It's 3, yeah
Oh, we're all someone's daughter.. we're all someone's son.. How long - can we look at eachother.. down the barrel of a gun?
snobs? or snogs?
or what?
But you said he's self-centered, but I haven't seen him anywhere else in the show
It's just weird to have a crush one someone you've never even seen :P
Tell that to the millions of girls in love with Justin Bieber
lolol sorry
ep 26
Yeah, thought he would appear on episode 26
and ofc u see him in ep 3
I have a crush on all ponies though
Rarity's 'HIM'
so I guess that's weird....
RobotPinkie - 0_o you do?
yeah yeah
but they're a different race, and fictional D:
lol no, I guess not really
(I say this because I do too and i'm still D; about it )
Blueblood x Trixie?
:O
I think more real women should be like Fluttershy
>racism
More women with The Stare?
:P
ohgodyes
Uh
Would you prefer someone who just uses The Stare on dire situations
That's it, they've all just hypnotized me...
Or someone who uses it for EVERYTHING?
10:3
"Go take out the trash John"
"Hold on, Ponies"
* STARE *
Hai :3
Trixie would use it for everything...
"<RobotPinkie>: I have a crush on all ponies though" explain >_<
NOWAI
:P
A crush on their personalities, not their hairy back ends maybe?
I HAPPEN TO BE AN EXPERT ON 2D ATTRACTION
Well yeah
lol
06poof
personalities? so no crush on their fillylike equine physique?
orly?
dat flank
Dman is going into Pinkie Pie interrogation mode!
06got me a neat HDMI cable for my monitor :3
I'm weird, but that just goes beyond the point of no return
omagad my alter ego:
Minnet: My character is a feral raven.
Sorry, I didn't get that.. what was it again?
They're just adowabwe, Dman, that's all
Yay yayayay ayayayayay
Minnet: I hate you.
Excuse me?
Talk, RobotPinkie. You are attracted to their bodies too. lemme hear you say it!
Omagad shuddup Dario_daz_mann
LOLOL 99 bucks for the HP Touchpad
Um, sometimes I look into the mirror and do this
huh? what, NO! I WANT YOU TO CONFESS!
/me flexes his muscles "Lookin' good, RP, lookin' DAMN good!"
I gave up looking at the mirror a long time ago
I want you to tell me that you would tap their flanks and are attracted to more than just their personalities!
Um, they all hate your parties and don't want to be your friends anymore?
D: y u do dis Dario_daz_mann?
Huh? That's not what I said!
06it couldn't take it...
Okay well this is my final reply: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmxyd6co6Qw
14 minute long AFA ftw
/me slaps LightLugia around a bit with a large Great White Shark
/me eats the shark

A HA! I KNEW IT! RobotPinkie IS attracted to the ponies!
NO U
See I don't get the song.
/me suddenly goes ubersad
But obviously I'm kinda slow
Oh no! RobotPinkie is attracted to fictional characters!
What do YOU have against people attracted to fictional characters, mister?
Hair goes floomf
I have nothing against people, being one of them on certain occasions. It's a perfect world, very well told with much depth in story and characters, and by far a better one than THIS world, so who can blame us? I was just doing a funny sketch with RobotPinkie, is all

Out of the ones I've seen, I agree
It zooms in at the right time

ah ok
Speaking of which, Twi didn't have darker-colored eyelids early on did she?
looks like we did a good job on copying the Twi one, RobotPinkieX

That's a though choice. Fluttershy plushie, or the Strike Freedom Lightning edition I've been drooling over for five years?
congrats.
Aw balls
06yes, i failed xD
that plush is going to go for a lot more than 81 bucks, I'm afraid...
Oh yeah.
But the Master grade I want is also $300 bucks
Minnet: my timezone is CET/CEST.
not in my price range!
Of course I need to save for a few months to get that :\

"To bake a pretty cake..."
OMNOMNOMNOM

I don't know where's that from.
No idea, Dmann

That was our Independence Day special.

IIRC, I was watching the movie more than the chat.
also saw 'independende day' :P
/me has a milk lolly
13You should all be jelly :B
but yeah, I thought that was pretty good of me considering I've never baked before.
So the lottery wont have any movie picks right?
and now I bake every other week...
13Hopefully it'll suppress my hunger until the lasagne has finished defrosting
Ziltoid: 6 draws for 6 FiM episodes
Nope, 6 eps is all

13And I swear there's no way of eating a milk lolly without it looking suggestive .w.
Brb going to clop furiously
to what?
everything
o-0;;
I misread that as eating milk.
even ... your mom?
even ... your dad?
even ... blueblood?
Didn't see lolly
L4D2 warns me about my video card, but it still runs fine.
I'm gonna look suggestive while EATING milk.
:|
/me is off for dinner
06no silly lasagna for me!
06BBQ :P
:'(
I want a BBQ
bloody crap weather
06i hope it doesn't smell that bad
I want to travel.
13I've said this before, but I've been to 2 barbecues in a thunderstorm this year :D
I managed to get a taste of those Bowers & Wilkins speakers I have been lusting after
Great sound but
It's too directed to the front
I need speakers that fill a room with sound, not fill the front of it with sound
so what is everyone up to? i'm very bored, just sat here staring into the street
Hmmm, okay, might just need to update Wine
it's supposed to run fine now
I'm just trying to get Portal 2 working, Dman :P
Nah, not gonna work today...
so you're on linux? didn't know this :3
05AW
05AE
/me hugglomps
Yep, Ubuntu
if u use linux, then yah firefox is only way to go :P
Not really, Chrome is nice
Opera is pretty nice too :P
ilike firefox for ubuntu
and opera i don't get y people like it?
sure it's good but so are a few others, it's not one of the best
I guess it's a matter of taste
I kinda prefer Chrome to both Firefox and Opera
same
my fave browsah
but it really bugs me that I can't switch themes in this version...
and in general, plugins are kinda hard to handle
http://doctorwhoovescomic.com/wp-content/webcomic/whooves/6.jpg it got updated!
I can't wait for the Doctor to meet Pinkie
Pinkie will look into the heart of the TARDIS.....
>mfw the Doctor was a pony in the first comic page
He called me a mule!
wut?
was that a flash-forward?
ohai FreezeFrame
Mules should be in S2. They have a bone to pick with Rarity.
: /
i'd prefer they remained a one off joke
GAUNGH GAUNGH GAUNGH GAUNGH
are they still a one off joke if they get used twice?
Perfect sound for Doctor Who...
They could get old.
...screw it, i'm feeling down, and not motivated to do shit. :( feelsbadpony. I'm going for a run. C y'all in an hour or so!
there's already a Token Mule in Ponyville. time for another racism episode!
aw, see you in a bit, Dman
ok Dman, cya later, hope you feel better
Later RobotPinkie, and thanks GGgala
Never seen the mule.
Unless it's off-canon.
Nittany_Tiger: watch Applebuck Season.
K.
Twilight made an anti-mule joke
Racism in a girl's cartoon. :p
See, if that one poorly researched review had just waited a few months, it could've made a point!

:>
13SS, are you doing a show today? Since I know you've had troubles with the RN community recently o-o
By the way, apparently there's a new HUB commercial that may contain S2 footage.
yes
/me types so he isn't the only one idle.
:O
its not really with the community as a whole
Sorry for posting a link, but here it is if anyone wants to see it http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v134/whimg/?action=view&current=lv09.mp4
just the management
i've been getting on their case apparently
You can post links now bro.
Oh.
Outside of our regular stream time.
same with ctr, although both him and i havent done anything wrong
omg, I have the bingest woner right now...
Season 2: implies Celestia is evil.
13If I were you I'd ask what their problem is and if there's a way you can fix it o-o
Very little FiM footage though, but still
I'm desperate for more pony
Matt claim's I have a bad attitude
:/
/me is beggining to make a custom SL desktop wallpaper
arn't we all
So what should I stream?
Princess Celestia's sexy season 2 eyes were all I needed.
PMVs?
Sure.
13Well if they think that, then just do your best to improve this so-called "bad attitude" that they think you have
well he also thinks im absolutely rebellious or w/e the spelling of that word is :P
I might play some Portal 2 though.... got it working, finally
13Sometimes people get the wrong impression from you and use it as a reason to put you down
Reading through all the EQD stuff I missed now.
13:3
>3dsforum>
>now awesome
13Silly example, but my sociology teacher thinks I don't enjoy his lessons at all because I don't contribute to class discussion, but really I'm just quiet and prefer to observe and listen instead
13So fair enough if he thinks that, but I'm trying to prove him wrong through the quality of the work that I do :B
Now.... slightly cooler.
Ok.
Give me a minute to finish reading the EQD articles.
Then I'll start the stream.
What's the schedule today?
05mew
Oh wait.
How late is it?
Hmm.
forty-five minutes to stream right?
Didn't realise it was so close to movie time already.
XD
The Goonies, Cutie Mark Chronicles, Lottery, Buckaroo Banzai, and Boast Busters.
Nevermind.
Gotcha, so a replay of tomorrow. I missed The Goonies yesterday, so now I get another shot. :D
Good
MFW can't have awesome Pinkie molded pony
GOD DAMN YOU HASBRO
WANT TO GIVE YOU MY MONEY BUT YOU WON'T LET ME!
On a side note, are you going to update the homepage for this site? (especially since dinkypage is down)
Meh, I could do, but it's a bit late.
Still though, that ornament looks better than any of the toys they've released
If you want I will do.
I upped the maximum time
Try it
Lowered the minimum time too
I love the molded toys.
13.w.
I know, it's just that that ornament looks so good.
...I only have two of the tiny molded ones
show-accurate toys are best toys
Maximum is 120
If anyone gets that I give him/her free muffins
!espeon !umbreon
aw, i wub the brushables
hello everyone
Oh yeah.
Twilight can come back out of my draw now.
Friends are gone.
ohai Sathi
I always have my ponies out.
Minnet: what's my timezone?
Sorry, I've no info for this channel.
hum..
Hi Sathi
I have money now, and I might, just might give my Punxsutawney Phil beanie baby some frieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeends.
Hi Sathi
Of course, that thing is sitting at my office...
Hey Polarfire.
Office ponies are best ponies.
Hey Dari :)
7how is everyone today then?
Oh, look, Sprinkles.
hai everyone else
:D
I'm good, just got Portal 2 to work on my PC.
I ended up falling asleep on the stairs.
Pretty good, although I'll have to leave near the end of Goonies.
Minnet: what's my timezone?
Lakorv: Your timezone is CET/CEST.
fwee~
Minnet: what's my timezone?
Sorry, I don't know that person.
lolol
interesting.
ah
Hello, BronyState
thanks, I'll fix that response. She meant to say, 'Sorry, I don't know /you/.' :P
Stairs are best beds...
This place is so much calmer before the stream starts :P
3BAM! I'M HITIN' Y'ALL WITH GREEN NOW
hello
6>read as "Stairs are the best bosses"
7depends a bit on the type of stairs
Hi. HOw is everypony?

How high is the reserve?
RobotPinkie, your name sounds like one of the most dangerous things in the world.
O_o
Minnet: what's my timezone?
Sorry, I don't know you yet. You tell me!
xD
That's because I am one of the most dangerous things in the world, herospirit
I am... a pony fanboy...
'Robot Pinkie' just makes me think of that creepy Pinkie Bubble Machine
time for pizza.
Hi new people
06nom
Aw, you never loved me, GGgala :(

Oh hai Barry
Question, should I upload my newest fic to the Pony fiction archive?
Is lottery today or was it yesterday?
you people are, if you can manage not to abuse the function, free to use the 'my X is ···' command for now
Doesn't the show start in half an hour?
Today I think
but please only set relevant information.
It's today
RP! how can you doubt me
4Today, dari
Ok.
it can be fetched through 'what is X's $field' or something like that.
Arg, I've got to decide what movies and episodes I want if I win.
No movies
7just eps
7no movies
Sorry, I don't know that person.
05I had pizza
05bagles
Next week we're doing a Lord of the Rings pseudo marathon
/me now poofs.
05were yum :3
6 eps
Gotcha
episodes as bookends for the movies?
I know which one I'd pick, but I'm not going to win, so....
6Stream's up.
I say it's a pseudo marathon because instead of watching all three movies back to back, we're watching one on Friday, the next on Saturday, and the final on Sunday
...it is?
/me tried it
6...CURSE YOU FME!
Not up for me.
6It gave me an error. One sec.
Let's all laugh at SirSprinkles's pain.
nor me
let's not and say we did
HA.
awww :[
what time of day are the LOTR movies going to show though? 7pm Eastern all days?
13Minnet: my character is a pink Espeon with heterochromia
Got that.
13:D
I believe so
06Lol
6NOW it's up.
lol oh wow, that's gonna be late

7my boss will hate me after the lotr weekend
6It is now.

6FME took forever to actually start. >>;
Why, Sathi?
SirSprinkles: but our streams are evenly split between 7pm Eastern and 2pm Eastern...
Hello
This stream is amazing
What is love?
A miserable pile of secrets!
...wait a sec
Hello everybrony
What is a Pony?
A miserable little pile of friendship!
13I thought you already knew what my character looked like :P
7cause I will be a zombie at the beginning of the week
Hey Sprinkles are you at the cafe?
Did we do the test runs yesterday?
Enough talk have at you!
/me instantly starts to do neckthrusts. Because neckthrusts are best headbobs.
05heh
I'm never miserable with ponies.
no their scheduled after the LotR event
Oh, cool.
05also apparently my sister's dog has sectoral heterochromia
Yeah.
We did introduce Cross as being hired though, yes?
we need to schedule new interviews
oh ok, Sathi, yeah I can see why :P
yes
I know we do.
hey dermathil
Oh dear I just turned on the stream
/me waves at Ziltoid while neckthrusting.
I just put the flags on Cross so he'll auto hop when he joins the channel.
wut neckthrusting?
eeeyup
Hi Ziltoid
Okay so who here ISN'T bobbing their head?
aka what Jim Carrey in the middle does
oh right
cant...stop..bobbing....head
Back, gentlecoats.
oh, the forward-headbob
6Jim Carrey = best neckthruster ever
Headbob includs the lowering of the forehead in a circular fashion. Neckthrusts are then it is done in a line.
welcome back, AllisZero
EEYUP you got THAT right SirSprinkles
06there's this white cat around here that has it and it looks
Oh, and thanks for the blast off kick yesterday Ghosties.
lol oh okay, Dermathil
06rather neat to say the least, but odd too
06xD
I guess I'm neckthrusting, then
13Take a photo of it :P
i didn't think there was an alternative to the neckthrust. i just called it a headbob
4Not a problem Dermathil
/me commences neckthrusting
Ghosties be sure to PM Ziltoid today
>music ends right then
The classical headbob is when you bob your head hard like at a rock/metal show
Oh Sprinkles, a regular user came in to the mod room yesterday
awwww
6It's honestly been a while since we've listened to this one...
Isn't that headbanging
I thought Hipster wanted to emphasize that I not tell him he isn't hired
your talking about headbanging
Oh well, whatever
dermathil
headbanging and headbob are seen as the same
NOPE
06I will try next time I see it
Its only head banging if you include the spider-man hand
05indeed
/me comes back. Sees what we're watching. lol
Yeah, we don't tell them they're not hired.
...and wtf?
06it's always creeping, but when you spot it it's gone within seconds lol
we don't ?
We don't.
nah, we typically don't
13Ninja kitty :3
This song is hilarious. I've never heard it before, what's it called?
In case we decide to bring them back for another interview in the future to see if they've improved.
And I dunno how he got in, but he did
This gif goes with everything
channel is unprotected
that's how
Channel might have dropped the all-ban again...
I guess dari didn't work his code on the mod room
WTF Collective
Unless Sprinkles wants to do it *pokes*
It does it randomly.
I can't.
Ponies + anything is awesome
: (
None of us have mod here.
Can't dari do it then? He has that house thing next to his name
I'll check if I can set us persistant bans.
I just asked my mom I'm decorating a cake for my birthday next week.
He can.
Ziltoid: So if we put this to GUile's theme, would the world blow up from the sheer epicness?
Err, next month
And dari, you should give us all mod here, just in case somepony breaks in again.
Fluttershy cake inc
You're welcome, herospirit
Well I did at one point.
Dunno what happened to it.
Is this channel registered?
It would form a "this goes with everything" black hole
We must make this happen Ziltoid
6No, Ziltoid. Gummy goes with everything.
>mfw my birthday is on a saturday.
Eeyup
Black holes: kings of the universe.
DO IT COLT
Doesn't mean it's registered
I only came here to say hi, I got thing's to do so bye :P

amazing, Ziltoid.
Alright
I'll give you all access then set the channel to restricted - that shouldn't unset.
just amazing.
what if we rename ourselves?
And you put the blanket ban on everyone else?
Im sorry
Eeyup
Sathi, then I'll have to change stuff.
:P
I am abut a dirty boy
*flutterstare*
...it's because yoou're using channel modes instead of flags for it.
The channel modes disappear after a while.
I need to figure out how to assign specific programs to specific outputs
(OHOHOH)
/me explodes twice
I mean, I do enjoy changing my nick ever now and then
you got me there SirSprinkles
It would suck if I couldn't get into the mod room because of that >.>
Can you do that? Can you explode twice?
BAWS
Mostly so I can keep iTunes playing on my laptop while I have my HDMI hooked up.
eeeeeyup
LIKE A BAWS
Well you can join then change your nick.
:P
EAT A BAGEL.
Or I can just put restricted on and add all the mods to the access list.
OH?
Did you set +B *!*@* flag and +E flag on all of us, dari?
That should stay permanent?
Eeyup.
Whatever makes it the simplest for mods

Evil Celestia is evil
and the lack of Rainbowdash and Twilight in the picture actually worries me
How did I miss it? I was just thar. D:
they may be in trouble in that episode
<- lol
0INB4 Trollestia is canon
No. I can't listen to this song!
also, I dunno why but it feels like that may be a scene from the Luna episode.
/me strangles a puppy in front of SirSprinkles
/me 7runs out once more
06:3
6Cool story.
every time I hear this song, I think of that god damn animal pound commercial
0The first episode of season has to be a luna episode
Especially how Celestia seems to be prominently present in the scene in a SERIOUS pose, contrarily to her other appearances.
6Are you gonna stick with that blue?
07then suddenly
THis song makes me a sad pony. :(

Ziltoid
07|3c

/me 7does a barrel roll! ._.      |:      .-.      :|      ._.
7we gonna need more chat colours soon!
no, it was updated
13:D
07@.@
Ziltoid: look at the Celestia image from the tidbit
She's looking serious and not like in other appearances. Also, lack of Twilight and RD when the 4 others are with Celly means trouble for me
6We still have like, four.
My sound's off for the stream. No song for me. SO HA. *listens to Pony Swag*
6Grey, ugly dark pink, dark green, and dark blue
4I WANT COLORS TOO
5bla
14bla
Seriously, why are we playing this?
4But maybe we can add more into our own domain, like a palette wheel of sorts
>_>
12I noticed part of Sathi's duties include being female
0I dont see it dermathil
6Actually, 5, dark grey
What's up Zebras!
Same here, muted it
Oh gog Pony Swag fits this gif really well.
6Yes, Cross.
4Yes, CB, and we all laughed
14hah
0Because trolling
OH MAH GAWD! BJORNFORT
14did you?
4I did
o.o
0always be trolling
/me puts on his viking-rapeface
you don't see the picture with Celestia and Rarity, AJ, Pinkie and Fluttershy behind her?
4Not at you being female, but at the being one of your "duties"
6I did it for the enjoyment I anticipated after permorming said activity
http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a257/GreenGuy1990/131385765929.jpg
The head bobbing is like, exactly in beat with Pony Swag. EXACTLY.
Is this working?
0I must have missed it
4I also enjoyed it, Sprinkles
I'm speaking of this image
/me 7should have more duties added
The four ponies seem to be very happy, though, so I doubt they're visiting twilight in her dungeon
6SPCA headbob. =D
0oh yeah I see it
oh oh oh, Dari, RBD said horrible things about the 10th doctor, you should totally enact mod vengeance against him the next time he's online <.< >.>
I am a tiger, not a zebra.
7Sathi is allrounder
4Yeah, so, I can't find Dystopia by Chaotrope on YouTube and it's pissing me off
I thought they were coughing
You're right, Pony Swag goes really well with this.
The 4 mane ponies look happy behind that serious Celestia
!minnet
See man.
ValtheJean: I banned RainBro so many times it isn't fun any more.
You already own me, silly.
6>implying I'm not going to update all the duties when I add Cross in.
:P
kyu!
/me tackles

Turning on sound again, then
/me slaps Nick with a halibut
4Nope, they haven't been updated
GOONIES.
2 seconds of season 2 animation gets shown, fandom explodes
4Hold on, Dari
Well I couldn't do that yesterday.

Thanks Ghosties.
4No prob

6...sounds good, if they get worked out properly.
ohai.
4I loved the idea
4I think we should do it
6Before we get started, guy, just one quick thing.
6We've updated our rules, (though not in the actual Rules link on the site).
6The new rules are here: http://i55.tinypic.com/294kyzo.gif
12Sounds like a good idea to me.
6Please take a moment to look over them when you can.
4THE CHAMP IS HERE! /JohnCena
7wait... who?
I'm sad the homepage hasn't been updated with today's movie listings yet.
who?
4Nobody
4Just nobody
4Some guy
MFW .gif
Wut.
4I'm sure FreezeFrame knows who he is
Some guy like Severus Mortego Orchevald IV?
I know who it is.
Ah, yes, Appledough
Wait what is airing right now?
0Great
4HAHA :D
Goonies, sotha
7Goonies
ooooooooooh
SHMUCK
4BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR APPLEDOUGH!!!!
0LAWL
Now I have a mental image of Big Mac as John Cena
He's even the right color (for now)
man I forgot how awesome this movie was
No, seriously, no.
4That's great
Oh, it's started.
7any idea's for a theme next week?
4Of course, Cena wouldn't sell though
stream keeps skipping for me
4Except merch
4theme?
Guns do that in real life.
0This is pretty awesome
I swear.
7yes, LotR weekend
rules have now been read.
IS there any way to make is so the chat box is to the right of the stream as it was in Dinkypage? For me it is below, and that is difficult.
It IS awesome.
you can, Sotah
0>victory pyramid
Sotha
The rules are updated on the site page now.
4sotha: CTRL zoom out
try zooming out a bit Sotha
I am watching it sideways right now
6I was going to ask somebody to make a banner for the site... just don't know who's good with photoshop...
sotha: make your window bigger.
(or is your screen not widescreen?)
4Err, ctrl mousewheel down
 ▲
▲ ▲
4Bjornfot
fail, Bjornfot
HAY U GUYz
4Don't spam
:c
Bjornfot can not triforce.
I wish this page looked like the dinkypage one...
What a pony LOTR banner?
6Yeah.
not wide screen. The window is already full.
0wut
DATA
what, is TWO LINES counted as spam?
Hmm
4Huh, maybe Silver
YAY
Ugh. You're right. I had to zoom out. Now everything is just tiny
Could edit the bridlemaids ad vectors.
4HEY THAR MR. JONES
6That would require Silver to be... online.
I was just trying to do a victory pyramid... :c
0AH SHIT
To make them look like a fellowship. :P
CHUNK
4I just know how you like to spam forces
chunk is comic relief
/me rawrs at Kyu
wow, I don't think I've ever seen this unedited
07.-.
/me sits all over Umbreon
4YOU HAVE MY SWORD /obligatory
12I have a pic of LOTR movie poster replaced with ponies you could mess around with.
your chance to shine then Sage
12sure start being all active when i'm not here
/me eeps
13!umbreon
Hmm, that sounds good.
4If you send it in skype, I'll take a look at it
what is it with people climb on top of people and sitting on people?
4I have absolutely no experience with photoshopping, but it might be good as is
6Bjorn, starting the triforcing will only result in others doing it. The "Don't spam" was a preliminary attempt to prevent spam before it started.
a wet sandy beach race... seems wise.
12it's just too insane for you
o
07fuzzy stuff is comfortable
>.<
07or whatever
and then, Samwise Gamgee.

Such window fail. When I'm zoomed out to see both the stream and the chat simultaneously, I can't access the buttons on the bar below the stream, so I have to zoom back in again to pause or change volume, etc.
/me 7likes it
Yes. It is.
OH YES, THIS SCENE.
hmm I'm liking how this new pic is coming along
07.-.
4Oh, I dunno. I'm not typically here when dari streams BBC programming
This scene is hilarious.
6When should we do PotC?
Hi Everypony
4...wait
6I was thinking when Winter break rolls around.
it is really good episode, Ghosties.
0dat CC
4Did we just decide to do PotC?
4Just like that?
Hi!
'Lo Purple!
6We decided to do it a while ago.

L.O.
R.U.B.C?

Hmm...
/me 7will stream house this week again :)
Eeyup.
Ignaesia: it so is
6We said we'd end up doing that, and likely Harry Potter, once the Harry Potter movies are all available... but that'll be a really long thing... and I'm not sure about it.
0so how much longer are they going to be....touching the statue
trolololo
06my new method of escaping stuff
That kid is hilarious
4And how many Pirate films are there
06"kevin? where is your homework?"

06"the bree ate it"
12Espeon is playing more espybutt the movie

7and fifth in the making
That prick looks like my brother
07whazzat
07o3o
6Again, not sure about it.
12i dunno
12i wish he'd tell me
12XD
6A fifth in the making?
I actually have that book that guy's mom is holding in her hand.
6What is this blasphemy?
7yep
07o3o;

That language is English...

The yellow kid has to use the servant's door next time.
12then add Jesp to your friends list
Yep. Still do.
07I did
07.-.
Not suspicuous at all.
12then get on steam
12I doubt they'll stop until Depp stops coming back
6Again, just a rough thought.
07I am
7exactly
6We never decided when to do it.
07.-.
12then add me
/me is working on it digitally
faileon
4Maybe next summer
Kids in the 80s were weird
4Which seems more appropriate
07I can't
Harr Potter has to be done.

6That is an insanely long time...
Harry*
/me ripped your HDD in half Nick

07I haven't put money into steam yet lol
HERR POTTER!
7magic and mystery weekend :P
12oh
07so I can't friend people
6HP would probably be good for summer, seeing as it's so long.
People in the 80s were weird.
07just the other way
07o3o
4It seems like PotC emphasizes summer fun though
0and their moms enjoyed statues with tiny genitals
0._.
6We could make a week out of it...
07XP
12then let me add you
You got it.
The 80s were weird.
4Why not both then
4Do both in the summer
0dat history book
6Or reverse the two... PotC for summer, and HP for the week long spring break.
4The 80's had the best pop
I was only around for the later part of the 80s
80s music rulz
LIES

06and Espybutt the movie is just a silly name I use for non-steam games, right now it's Swat 4: The Stetchkow Syndicate or however it's spelled :P
4.....................nahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, let's do both in the summer
True
It also brought Transformers.
6It would start and end on a Friday.

But MLP from the 80s was weird too,
06But of course, the amount of puns that can be made = endless
... and alive
6>implying we'd have to have every mod here every day
Who's a silly pony?
but without it, we wouldnt have FiM
6>implying we wouldn't have more mods by then

/me makes kyu listen to bon jovi

Ignaesia*
Yeah*
6Yeah, not working.

4Alright, edited the Steam announcement to say the pony eps will be after the movies
12Meh, fair enough. Just giving my thoughts.

6OH.
It sounded like the gunshots you hear in movies. :|'
6It's with 0's, not O's.
Spoiler: The kid's skeletons will be found in 1996
XD
6I thought you were saying with O's not 0's.
He dropped his pot....they were talking about drug dealing
6>>;
and not like the gunshots you hear in bambi
6I was wondering why you typed out the 0's in the first place.
7:D
Password had to include numbers.
:P
or the gunshots you hear in MLP:FIM. Real gunshots
And no one wanted to suggest one (Sathi did actually, but I'd already changed it by then)
Mmmmm, an icemachine rusting for the last twenty years. Let's see, if there is something to eat in it.
All the gunshots in FiM are real gunshots.
Bambi's mother was asking to get shot.
Every single one.
Agreed.

And a glass of cianti
Dman's not there Ziltoid.
Oh yeah.
4And FTP mode and all that jazz?
I made that page, but decided to do it a different way.
Damn*
It's not actually necessary now.
there I did it
lololol
/me claps
6Was it like, script or something? Oo
lol
Epic spelling correction

6Also, I'm going to make a History page for the list of movies we've shown.
Dman is now officially Damn
lol "bullet holes the size of matza balls"
It's wet, ain't it?
It was for the end of my puzzle
and we shall address him as such from now and forever
You had to type the konami code on the home page of our site.
Mantza holes.
/me Pulls Umbreon's tail and runs off
Matza*
6Yeah.
6I thought so.
12o-o
I love bears
6I'll actually use it for scripts, so we can keep the script for the countdown clock on the site.
and siging
4I have no idea what is going on right now :S
>he can feel one eyed willie down there
6Instead of importing it from elsewhere...
he's a bear...
Why am I so interested in this old-ass movie from the 80s which I've seen about a dozen times in the bast when I didn't have stupid cable
I think I'll make a countdown timer that we don't have to update ever week.
I think it's because my brony friends are here.
Because that's just annoying.
:P
Dat mutant
cocks harder than my mama's cannolis
I've never seen it
6It takes me two seconds to do.

/me feels uncool

Meh, sometimes you can't access the page.

6And I prefer it this way for when we do special events.
You're not always at your computer.
ive never seen it either
06you can kill Umbreon, or shave him, even make period jokes about him
Also, it'd take 2 seconds to add in a new date to countdown the way I'd do it.
Me neither
06but stealing his tail is too much!
XML driven flash.
12period jokes?
/me gets out a BFG9000

2Insane_Lugia uses 2Shave on Umbreon! It's a critical hit! Umbreon has 10 HP left!
You just add a new date to the XML file, it'll show the countdown to the closest date in the XML file.

Yeah.
It'd allow for anything you want it to do.

6Could you by chance make a decent chat client, just so that we can have more colors to choose from?
k cya ima go back to lurking
6And a server... we really need our own server...
It jumped out of the bushes
A server I've got set up.
6I'm tired of dealing with tech issues.
I've said that a couple of times.
But I'm not sure if my internet can handle 300 people.
6Cool, we'll switch when we go to our new domain then?
6Ah.
I wonder why it was hiding in the bushes
Which is why I suggested something else.
6Yeah, that's a problem...
It just wanted to be pet by Fluttershy
As in all the mods runs a server each for the duration of the BMN stream at least.
The ones not streaming anyway.
ah yes, the elusive fish-rake.
6That would require us all to have the ability to run a server.
>cockblocked
That chick has the best hair
now is not the time for that activity
Nah, I can set everything up for you guys.
I said before.
You'd just need to run the program.
her lesbian friend sure is jealous
6But I would like a better built in chat client. Not much better, but with at least better color selection.
nor the place for it
read that as furry
I do have a client partially made.
But.
Meh.
6i.e. type in hex, get color.
NOPE
6It doesn't need to be soon, just, at some point.
Fuck you, guys, i am going home!
The problem with that Sprinkles is, it would only work with other people using my client.
YOU SLUT
Shut up lesbo
Chrome can go die in a fire
6>built in client
*klutz*
To people on mIRC and any other client it wouldn't show lal the different colours.
it's never stable anyway.
Lolumad lady?
all*
U mad
She mad
I also had the idea of adding the ability to play games with people using the same client.
6Then they should be using the client that's built in to the stream page, which would be that client.
6That would be cool.
So you could play noughts and crosses, 4 in a row, etc.
I haven't really seen that on IRC before.
6Give them something to do when the stream isn't on.
it's more stable than FIREFOX
Fifty dalla bill
...no
Crazy teenage Eddie Lizzard.
Chromium takes half a year to load a single link at times

Problem is last time I worked on my client was a while ago.
and when at first it gets slow, it stays slow.

Not sure where I got to with it.
Doktah Jones, Doktah Jones.
Or if I remember how it works.
6Again, not something that needs immediately done.
50 bucks?! we can buy back the house with that kinda money!
My coding is usually pretty hard to understand. XD
6Just, whenever you feel like it.
I can't buy a new video game for that kind of money
I suppose I could release a provisional version.
Chocalate eruption?
Icecream has a smell?
he smells ice cream through 3 inches of metal
Because the hard part is making it multiserver/multichannel capable.
Aaaaaaaand?
Chunk is the man
HAhahahah
Which was what I was working on when I last tested it.
They have Grape... and Grape
I can buy a third of Skyrim collectors edition with that money.
c:
Chunk has superpoers
06that be your internet connection lakrov
06a browser doesn't have ANYTHING to do with loading speeds
I could release a quick version which only lets users join one channel or something.
pizzatime
6>smells ice cream
6>doesn't smell dead guy
6...wat
People in the 80s were as dense as the shitty Duke Nukem Forever AI
he could smell icecream through the fourth wall. GODDAMMIT CHUNK GIVE ME MY ICECREAM BACK.
its because hes fat get it? lolololol
Chrome is way better than Firefox lol :p
Selective attention

IE9/10 is still the best
/me flees
He touched the pepparoni. Ice him!
Internet explorer can't even draw pages properly
anyway, I'll be back eventually
and it doesn't follow standards either
It will :p
6Which is all we'd need initially.
Some of our current users use mibbit to join their own channels though.
because frozen food tends to have a strong smell
6Yeah...
Not sure if everyone would be happy only being able to join one.
I know very well what is my connection and what is not.
Pedo corpse
Kids screaming and yelling under 2 inches of badly placed wooden floors
And nobody notices
giving the term "stiff" a new name...
if a BROWSER takes that much CPU then it's your cpu that's crap
6Yeah, be better off if you got it all done and released it.
Gimme sugar, chump
or, meaning
a Browser isn't CPU intensive at all
6We can deal with mibbit until then.
06i only use 2 if 8 CPU's, and my connection is stable enough for 20MB/S internet
I'm sure that if Youtube were around back then
ctr: yeah, sure my Intel dualcore at 1.87 GHz per core is crap..
Never seemed to have that problem with any of my browsers before :P
We'd have a ton of videos calling that corpse a pedo
1.87ghz dual core
And suing the producers
Yeah, crap for this time :P
Thank go we have that now
This is 2011, not 2005 xD
And? :P
Gesundheit!
Chrome doesn't even eat 10% of my 2.0 GHz single core Pentium 4 on my 7 year old PC XD
Most laptops are quad/duo at 2+ ghz

this dualcore at 1.87 outperforms old dualcores at 2.5
worst possible rescuer
And whee, brb
ctr: how many tabs and how long's it been running? :P
Spoiler: Fat guy doesn't fit window
>walking forever
15 tabs and many hours
>3 minutes
Shut up, Eddie Lizzard!
I can usually run Chrome with 25+ tabs fine for a hour or two
And that's a lot of tabs
Lights.
well you're lucky then.. I'm low on tabs (19) and have had this running for about 10 hours I think.
getting slow now.

Chunk used STALL!It's super effective!
They're in a cave
and no, Firefox is memory light compared to Chromium.
because the plot says so
I watch it for the plot
Ohgreat, candles.....

did the kid with asthma spray die in the IT movie?

I'm sure that would have been very effective
Short Round is best round.
Merry-go-round is best Round
I'm just using around 60% of my RAM with mIRC/Chrome/WLM/Powershell and a couple of folders open :p
Go over there, Shorty and don't touch anything - CRASH! - I didn't touch anything!

Nope, lol

Chunk is a supertroll
Watch out for that Batdemic!
I thought of giving Chrome a try
they need to bring ozzy in there, teach those bats a lesson
Shock and Terror
but seeing as its memory intensive I will not
what the hell, the bats disassembled the fireplace?
time for a bat smoothie
omnomnomnom
ok
Now that 47 bronies are here,i could ask if anypony knows who Jonah Hex is.Why would i ask that?Because Josh Brolin is in this movie,and he plays Jonah Hex in the Jonah Hex movie.It makes sense.
SUPER-BATS
plus you are stuck with the interface Google wants you to have
Well
Pegacorn: I know the basics.
Alright, gonna go work on my picture
The interface Firefox has been adopting :P
I am epic nerd.
I kinda want to watch Batman Begins now...
So you gentlecoats have fun with the movie
you can't customize Chorme
There are other builds of Chrome/ium and other browsers too :p
I'll be back for the episode
bye alliszero
you can customize Firefox
whoa
You can have themes on chrome.
Beautiful Waterfalll all the wayyyyyyy
later, AllisZero
I don't know what you're talking about.
You can customise Chrome too?
:P
And LOl personas
Pegacorn: which one is he?
also gentlecoats
No idea.
Jonah hex is a second string DC character right?
Tata
I like the vimium extension for Chrom(e|ium)
I should know (chrome pony theme).
it makes it keyboard-usable.
Jonah Hex is a forgotten DC character,but he's totally BAWS.
How DARE you say he's Kennedy!!!!!
It's Charlie Sheen you moron!
Where's the Charlie Sheen coins?
4About to go idle. Can't have that
WINNING
Not a physics major, that librarian chick...
Charlie sheen coins are more than anyone could survive
He was in the justice league animated series, thats the only reason I remember him
Pegacorn: Ah, it's the big brother guy.
Sooo many coins. Scott Pilgrim must have been here.
7okay this is getting annoying
Keyboard browsing seems very slow
He was in Batman The Animated Series
Multitasking interfaces plz
7need to press refresh every 3 or 5 mins

06dmanit caps lock xD
lol
06nah, not handy hor me xD
nope
'many ram'
sticking with Firefox
Jonah Hex is so BAWS that he can be in a show that's not even his and make it so that the show's main character isn't there!
4Also, I have a question. Would it be okay to pick "Boyz in the Hood" for A movie?
and its Personas
I removed the top of the capslock button
sorry
06got a Philips225B and a HP1740, it's good

It's every boy's dream to make it with Andy

Goonies :D
someone forgot his meeeeeeedddddss...
Fun Fact: You can't slow down your fall, by slashing the sail with a knife.
Mythbusters
ftw
awesome show
4The closest we've come to decide on something like that is where each mod picks their favorite movie we've shown (or favorite A movie shown) and then we restream it
You can prevent death by falling by using commando pro
>yfw that move isn't done to slow fall but to ruin the sail so the bad guys can't escape as fast
COMAAAAAAAAAAAAAANDOOOOOOOOOOOOO
She's the Gooniest of all the Goonies

there are weak spots to anything.

giggle at the ghosties, giggle at the ghosties !!
4I see Pegacorn is a wrestling fan as well
there are such things as PCMCIA USB interfaces
Pegacorn: group?
Evil Dead 2 needs a restream sometime. XD
4Or just a John Cena fan
SHHH anon
I had one that did USB 2.0 back in 2002
Because it's so great.
ARGGGHH
not true
we could go on like this forever.
GGgala,i made a Jonah Hex group earlier today.
4...I concur
all the older ones have PCMCIA
4You should pick it, dari
Dat product placement.
Ghosties,i'm a wrestling fan even though i know it's fake.
4When we do favorite movie
many of which have CardBus which is 32 bit PCMCIA
Chunk's hungry because he's fat.
Scripted
4Yeah, scripted
Pegacorn: OH i see what you mean now :D joined
Right.
And yes, it is an important distinction.
My laptop seems to have two expansion slots on the side o.o
Cannibal kids!
4It really is to pro wrestling enthusiasts
Sorry about that mistake Ghosties.
Also wondering why it seems to have a screw on there, hah
dat kiss
4Haha, it's no problem. I'm not gonna jump down your throat for calling it fake like a lot of other smarks will
ok
It is an important distinction in general. Fake implies that there's no risk going on, while scripted is a much more apt description since it says "the end is determined, but the risk is huge"
its too big
giggity
Greetings.
4And FreezeFrame is right
RUBE GOLDBERG AGAIN
True dat FreezeFrame.But that does bring up a question to me.Why the hell did they make HBK quit?
PCMCIA CardBus provides very fast speeds
that doesnt seem physically possible.
4They didn't force him to quit
4He retired
It was the story for his retirement.
it isn't, EF.
ok
in fact I have seen TV tuner/video capture cards and USB interfaces for it

screw them
I'VE BEEN SAVED BY MY PINCHERS OF PERIL

4I only ask because we're choosing six eps this week and was wondering if any special rules apply
Thank you NIck!
06heya Ecco :3
dat pun
6We're already going to watch 6 eps, which I'm sure we can probably PREDICT what they are, so adding special rules would be annoying.
hey eccy chan
what pun?
Need to refresh stream again, I think, I'm lagging behind
cut
B-flat
flat
"B flat"
oh *hits refresh*
12Oooh, predictions...
see? even pirates love water slides.
^ 3 ^
4On that topic of prediction, I've already got the list of fim eps up so if I get chosen, you best believe I'll pick something we've never seen in Brony State
ESPECIALLY pirates love water slides.
^^
Pirates of the Caribbean (TM) - Water slide (C)
waterslide? I love missing whole scenes due to refresh
6...but we've seen them all in BronyState. =D
fine you?
4...fuck you're right
bummer
4I mean, chosen
HOW DID THAT GET THERE?!?
4I know -_-
06i'm good, just rp'ing at 3 different places, playing a strategy game on my iPad2, and fixing internet
06:3
4What I mean is that I'll pick something that hasn't been chosen yet
Same a car gets in to your basement.
So really at its core this is just a pirate movie?
Omigosh, a man1
4has Applebuck Season been picked before?
He almost kissed Eddie Lizzard
Better go tell Grampa
random trivia from friday: the whole ship was real. THey built it for real and when they were done wanted to give it away for free. Nobody wanted it so they scrapped it. Parts of it became part of the Pirates of the Carribean Disney ride.
6Don't think so.
dat boat
hey guys, been playing Metroid alt-tabbed while watching chat and the Goonies, gimme some encouragement Bronies, I'm facing Ridley!

Rock farm ... yes, likely
RUMB DOCKS
best story is best story
/me is wondering how Equestria was made
FACT: Pinkie's Story is 100% reliable and true.

Pinkie Pie used TELEPORT

SEASON 2 AD
Dat Polka Music
PARTAY!
Dman: sounds fun heh. surprise parkour then.
If you'll notice, this is the smae song used to lure the Parasprites
Pinkie Pie is so clearly adopted.
it's the windmill from Ocarina of Time
inb4 swarm of the century music
Pinkie Pie invented parties
actually Facebook is nice when you are HALFWAY ACROSS THE COUNTRY OR WORLD FROM YOUR FRIENDS
03...Firefox just froze, great
Rodman lol awesome
03and ^
and or classmates
She's the God of parties.
poll: is that filly octavia?
and thats how Equestria was made!
Rodman: Actually, i'm a big participater of it. only once or twice a month with friends though, but it sure is fun :3
You startled the witch.
And thats how Equestria was made.
And that's how Equistria was made.
rear
they like it!
GGgala: did somepony say implying?
Firefox is a very reliable and great browser
*sarcasm*
and tha's how equestria was made
induring equestria was made spam
Dman, what you talking about?
eeyyyyyyyyupppp
tis the same song she played for parasprites
and Chrome is a steaming pile of crap
Hmm
Pinkie Pie you so random
Smileseizures?
6Reused sound clips ftw
NO
@valthejean That's what I said>
Sirsprinkles: eeyup
ack sorry rodman, i meant that for gggala. you two and RobotPinkie here so often my little head gets confused >_<
06atleast it doesnt eat 9999999 gigs of ram
Dman: wait, did you mean me or Rodman?
06just as firefox
Some of the balloons at the party make up Pinkie Pie's cutie mark.
oh you did
ah, sorry. didn't notice that >.<
Pinkie Pie = Lauren Faust?
Defend her honour and let her drop to her death.
06*sarcasm..?*
voice crack go!
ʎʇıʌɐɹפ ƃuıʎldɯı<
GGgala: you! so sorry!
Filly Dash!
actually Chrome does
well
and Dman: no, i added the implying just cuz :p
it eats up your RAM like there is no tomorrow
^
plus the expandibility sucks
Fact: Rainbow Dash is flying through the Starfox 64 training parcour.
Filly dash = awesome dash
When Chrome freezes, at least not every tab does :P
6WINNING
WINNING
DAT SQUEAKY VOICE!
*checks to see if Hipster_Brony is online* whew...alright then *clears throat* Rainbow pony is worst pony
do a barrel role
WINNINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
I checked the extensions and themes
winning¨
NOT IMPRESSED
Well
Pinkie Pie is Equestria's joker, right down to unreliable narrator-ness. The reason she isn't murderously insane is that Equestria is a sugar bowl.
huuuuge G's
She likes winning
And then she lost her mane and tail
I am sticking with Firefox
DAT SMILE
chrome already has firebug built in
Legendary pony
Bjornfot is here too? :O
13I don't care what browser I use, so long as it works
*lulz at Beavis and Butthoof thinking they can beat Rainbow Dash*
"to DEFEND FLUTTERSHY'S HONOR!" and then there was FlutterDash.
at least it has not given me trouble
Adblocker is not very great but works
13I just use firefox because it's what I'm used to
DAHS IS NOT LESBIAN, SHE'S BI. BI-WINNING
12Raibow Dash is best pony.
ctr: my chromium /does/ kill every tab, strangely..
retarded face is retarded
and I set it up so that I like it
AE, Agreed
Tweetdeck is AWESOME
13why change it when this works just fine? :P
wait "against all odds" to defend Fluttershy's honor? What are you saying about Fluttershy?
6...DEMODDING TIME
No, that's how you earn 6 cutie marks.
AT THE SAME TIME.
BAM!
no Dman, it's all in your imagination
Dash is just that awesome.
BAM! there it is!
dash totally dated gilda in high flight schoo
Oh here comes the explanation!
Bjornfot D:
The plot!
the theme
dat halfop
Silly comments. Rainbow Dash isn't a Lesbian. SHE'S NOT EVEN FROM LESBIA!
Got the best pony right.
Trololo
7waaaat
gummy: Yeah, I can totally believe it.
Dash is the cause for 6 cutie marks = 20% most awesome pony
the equestria

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!
Lol Sprinkles. XD
awesome then! yay~
even though fluttershy is totally a hippie
My opinion is that Firefox is faster than Chrome when not many tabs are open
6Dari and I are the only ones that can actually properly fight eachother. XD
Mod War: WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON?!
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
but Chrome wins when more tabs are open
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Can we all agree that if it isn't Safari/Opera, it's a good browser?
6After Two Towers on Saturday is Griffon the Brush Off and Bridle Gossip.

I couldn't tell where I was in that list.
Huh, that was still on...
WHERE IS MY WINTER WRAP UP BEST EPISODE?
:(
/me wonders why there was no film lottery for next week. Did we have that yesterday? I kinda fell asleep halfway during the stream...
I wanted to see Swarm of the Century myself.
RobotPinkie, I have a request, if you don't mind.
No THE GREAT AND POWERFULL TRIXIE?
Episode 8: Look Before You Sleep is really hard to find on Youtube
Awww, no Suited for Success???
6AND ON TO BUCKAROO BANZAI
What, Dman?
12 chances and I still didn't win.. D:
Bjornfot, LOTR marathon
Bjornfot: LOTR event next week
I was hoping for Pinkie Keen or Stare master
I would have said Feeling Pinkie Keen.
Drat, I was just in time to be late
>mfw faster than dari
Nittany_Tiger_ has good taste
ah well
RobotPinkie, could you do a very special vector just for me?
is that INSTEAD of the normal show?
yes
i thought it was a bonus
Dermathil: Typed twice as much as you
extended editions
6It was specified at one point during raffle, actually.
Fine, Safari is the worst browser ever made then :P
Lawl
Look Before You Sleep is the worst episode.
EXTENDED YEEEAAA
goddammit, best episodes have to be on the day i can't come
What do you want me to do a vector of, Dman?
4So HAH!
6I used to put it in the threads "G4 Pony Episode"
Look before you sleep is underrated
At least Zecora episode Bridle Gossip was taken.
Movie ftw
6But I don't bother anymore...
4But man
.... as an anon. Stupid chat client fail.
yay zecora
Suddenly, SW text wall
...
Indeed, I would've picked Look Before You Sleep
BANZAIIII
I've never seen it specified.
4YFW only one episode that you predicted to get picked got picked
Dman, you read the new rules?
7different intro?
12Back in a bit.
7hahaha
They'Ve been changed a 'lil bit
7smart CB
Dermathil, new ru,les finally put in place? : D
You want it as a large PNG, Dman?
Look before you sleep is better than people give it credit for
You read em?
...
...
7this movie... has a different intro :o
Someone needs to fix that graphic.
OH no. Oh no oh no. I don't know if I can take any more Buckaroo Banzai.
6I'm highly surprised, but I did forget about Sonic Rainboom and FWF... which are incredibly popular.
uuuhhh, mods, the nrew rules...well, the text...it's uh...pretty stretched out i have to say
Dman: they postd them earlier in chat, not up on the website yet: http://i55.tinypic.com/294kyzo.gif
10yeah different intro :P
RobotPinkie, i'd like that :3
oh wait you found it
GGgala: yfw it's there in RULESA
and the text is way squashed
LBYS is consistently regarded as the worst episode.
also GGgala it's pretty stretched right?
7they areup on the website
IMPOSSIBARU
12Meh, I forgot about Winter Wrap Up. Probably should have picked that.
DMan: mfw it wasn't an hour ago
eyup sathi like I said :3
lol GGgala
Yeah, rules graphic is squashed flat.
very squishy I feel D:
6I believe dari put them on the site.
@Dman, I'm on Ridley right now
How big, though, Dman? I mean that's a very clear pic, so I could probably mostly auto-vectorize and have it done in 10 minutes
6Yeah, new rules are up on the site.
ReticentSmolder: yeeeaaa
7also the rules look odd... on the website
12But FWF is still a really great one, def one of my favorites.
Dman: *refreshes* looks like they changed the URL but not the height/width attributes
Pinkie Keen usually gets more hate than LBYS
Black Dynamite vs Buckaroo Banzai
wait...I just entered the room and he wasn't there...wtf?
RobotPinkie, please, it's ar equest, so you can take your time =]. I wouldn't mind something 3 or 4 thousand long and however tall though ; )
thanks!
6GGgala, yeah, I'll fix it when I get a moment, dari forgot to fix it.
7I liked my intro more :P
It's attached to his butt.
6It's because dari didn't fix the height/width of the image, and this one is MUCH larger than the old one.
go SirSprinkles !!!
Pinke Keen is merely the most loudly hated.
I thought they looked weird.
oh, there he is :P, dun dundun DUN DUN dun dundun DUN DUN
Assumed it was just the font or something.
I dont know why owlicious gets a bad wrap
is it for you, dman or someone else?
so can somepony give me the sypnosis on this movie?
Rawhide is not a nickname one should have.
Nopony likes Feeling Pinkie Keen?
RobotPinkie: me of course! Ineed an epic vector to base my hairstyling from, and who else to turn to but yourself!
Sumica: better than Bareback
I hear it's the most australian movie since crocodile dundee
I missed this movie yesterday. I fell asleep in my armchair.
10Ignaesia, lots of people say banzai, there's something about the 8th dimension, there was this thing, with some cowboys, oh and rock music.
Ahh okay, cool, Dman
I like Pinkie Keen, it gets a bad rep cause ppl think the moral relates to religion
/me is having a very very hard time reading the new rules. : / dat stretch
10lol bjornfot, you baller
Pretty sure I didn't specify a height/width for the image though.
I like Pinkie Keen, people just don't like the moral I think is thing.
>mfw Season 2 has a Brokeback Mountain parody
7patience dman
All I did was put it on the page.
I actually have school now, rainbrodash! I'm studying science!
10!
10epic
RainBroDash it already sounds awesome
The "star" of this movie was so embariced after do this he did't want to show his face again. So he went and did robocop.
It should just look as it normally does
:>
4"I can dance!" Welp, that's my cue *plays Safety Dance*
10Dman, then right click and open image in new tab
Okies Sathi
7*joins in on the dancing*
Oh didn't know ghosties was here too :3
I still maintain Elements of Harmony, Griffon the Brush-Off and Party of One as the three worst episodes.
ohai guys
RainBroDash, I did. I had to to read the new ones xD
7lo Combustiblelemons
Faust says the moral supposed to be connected to Dark matter and Quantum Physics... ...you know, for kids.
sup Combustiblelemons ya made it!
/me dodges the inevitable flames after mentioning Party of One in the context of 'Bad'
lolwut?
really?
not...enough...MISSILES DAMN YOU RIDLEY
The worst episode is the glossy indians one.
7inb4 brains
No no, the appleloosa ep is worth it for the epic boxing pony

ReticentSmolder: congrats man!
um what
is that a flux capacitor?
Dman, Ridley is super fucking easy compared to his later iteration in Super Metroid
Looks pretty fluxy to me
this is some tron shit here
ReticentSmolder: i no rite. gba games are sorta easy, but hella fun!
"And yes, we have ways of knowing if your are ban evading"
Dat lie
XD
there, finally got some time off to watch this again! :D
I dimension not of space or time but of crap.
6We... technically do.
.... alright, I missed a lot didn't i
>Show microbes as examples of interdimensional predators
ah, so its not nearly as hard as the famicom version?
If they are using a proxy and a different nick we'll never know.
:P
not in my opinion, ReticentSmolder
well, I died once to Ridley, and 3 times to kraid >.>
6The html on the site is giving a size specification for the image.
still is a Metroid game, bro
Hmm
Oh yeah
Fixed.

Not the least bit inspired to dra right now

Draw*
oh hey AllisZero ya got back for movie night?
That looks delicious
I've been here since Goonies, Dman
Is that a... BRAIN?
Ghosties: You know you're a wrestling fan when your first thought for Spanish class about writing an essay on a famous Hispanic person is to write about Eddie Guerrero
ah, AllisZero, I got here like 10 mins ago - was out.
|:-<
Yes, that's what I did. And got an A :D
But I flipped my monitor over to my drawing table and just watched
4>reads it, thinks Eddie when seeing the word "Spanish"
Yup, we missed you
4So, yep. Awesome A by the way XD
what.
oh jesus lithgow?
Goonies is awesome

Yep RobotPinkie
6Yeah, it's good now.
Awesome
This movie hurts my brain with science

ikr
Science drugs!
This movie blinded me.... with science....
In Soviet Russia time machine makes YOU!
so AllisZero how's that hugeass 10 years of work transfer coming along?
The essay was in Spanish, of course.

Good question, I haven't checked since that time
12oh no

Been what, five hours since 11 o-clock?
So not only did I get an A for a writing assignment (when I hate writing), but I also got it writing in a non-native language.

That's not 85 mph, you sillies.
ROFL
AllisZero: mfw it's 11pm CET

...Penny Pretty? Such realistic names
and Rezo the 4ish hour ones so extended ones

Yeah, what I'll do is...
/me points his finger at the crying girl and laughs. "You've terrible 80s hairdo!"
LOTR extended edition guys!
"I know what'll cheer you up! Being the center of attention of a crowd of judgemental strangers
Watch it in 1080p while I'm here with you guys how 'bout that

03*yard
Bjornfot, any idea where Pegacorn is tonight?
Bigbooty?
really
12now you can go outside and watch it drf
armed
03though I'm honestly surprised we still have power
or a commercial pilot
12lightning never strikes in the sameplace :P
Oh SilverMane, I'm so lonely... Pegacorn is nowhere to be seen tonight! Please comfort meee! ;__;
!bike
/me saw Soital stealing his bike 04"ASH STOLE MY BIKE!"
03my street has like the worst power lines ever
03if you even tap it
john bigbooty
03it goes out
03LOL
LOL
This is the A-movie, right?
03that's why we got a generator, way too many power outages
b movie\
12drf knowing you you probably have backup generators that can power your house for 2 years
Kicking doesn't do anything.
nowai
03Umbreon, no
buuckaroo banzai
You have to wait for the nick to timeout.
grrr
o robotpinkie u so crazy
4Sathi, were you blaaaaaaaa
it's big bootay!
03our generator can power our house forever
that was so annoying
03but it runs off natural gase
03-e
RobotPinkie u know goonies was A movee :D
took over 6 mins
I think we had two B movies tonight :o
4So you were blaaaaaa
12so if the gas stations run out of gas
yes
12then you are screwed :P
4Ah
03LOL
...and not a single fuck was given that day.
Little Mac?
03natural gas comes from the power plant dude
Wut.
Hey everypony. How is the movie goign?
going?
I'm sorry Bjornfot, I have other priorities to manage. I give you permission to harrass mai waifu for a little while though
Rezo, goonies is A movie clearly :3
bbl town
No but seriously, just because something is funny doesn't mean it's a B movie
12if the power plants ever shut down
12you are screwed
soltha: like a bad acid trip
it's going crazy
I asked you to link me the safety dance then I crashed
cool
4Ah
4Hold on
Goonies is supposed to be funny.

10....
4there you are
10silvermane
10how very dare you
rainbrodaaash~
RainBroDash, does SilverMane care?
i think goonies is over
sure is hunty
drats
yay thanks
I haven't shed tears in the last ten years
Everypony: Is NewDCD / somemodelse doing after-show?
yes cause lizzardi and wizzard are easily mistaken.
Why do I have my eyes wet reading a Rainbow Dash comic on DA?
>not shedding tears of joy during sonic raijnboom
This show is full of witchcraft, I tell you
and now to put it on loop :)
link allliszero
I shed manly tears during At the Gala when I watched it live
AllisZero, which one? the one with her being olda t the end? link?
was up all night reading dr whooves fan fic and slept through the goonies
Buckaroo Banzai: This movie was intended to be A-movie quality when it was made. Apparently they didn't realize how insane the script was
10bjornfot. don't give me those eyes. I'm not swayed as easily as PEGACRON
Bjornfot: You can just type 'al' and hit TAB. do it, colt!
meh nothing reduces me to tears after watching it
remember to post picture, AllisZero by right clicking opening in new tab, and taking THAT URL and pasting it here :3
pack his saddle bags? But he's not a pony.
Yes that
lolol, some jackass is going to complain about this, but seriously, this movie has a ridiculous amount of good actors in it.
RainBroDash, i said he can harass you; i didn't say you wouldn't beat the tar our of him for it
true dat SilverMane
So... A movie that's trying too hard to be A, and thus fails at even being B?
Rezo, thus by definition a B movie :3 hahaha
even thou it fails at being B, that makes it B lol
Did anypony ever see that comic where the events at the end of Sonic Rainboom didn't happen as RD failed the sonic rainboom and KOed herself, everything was her in a coma
...no, Ignaesia, but that sounds cryworthy ;__;
also, Bjornfot, remember. Mai Waifu RainBroDash is very special to me. You hurt him, and I hurt you. With a wrench.
yeah it was dman...
Well.. A B movie that knows its a B movie and acts accordingly is a great B movie. A B movie that thinks it's an A movie on the other hand, is a shitty B movie
Oh SilverMane, you naughty pony...
10oh dear.
Yes?
Still better than spiders web.
so...SilverMane, you gave permission to harrass RainBroDash, but so that RainBroDash would fight back, and you would then dfend him? so like, you basically set up an ambush for Bjornfot ?
Dman, stop reading the script
7Combustiblelemons: everything beats that movie
Spiders Web is a true work of art. We should watch it aga- *is banned*
goes without saying, comb
oooooh
If you can dodge a Dashie you can dodge a wrench?
clever
Combustiblelemons: *
>implying I'm not a Viking who can do anything
10^
In what way does this movie try to be something it's not? They were obviously aware of how silly the concept was.
Cmon guiz, no A vs B movie arguments. I think this was added to the rules due to the scott pilgrim debacle
I think I can manage
Rezo be trollin'
lol desktop ponies
A ROCK!
Then Dragon Wars is a good B movie according to your logic Rezo
Ignaesia: there was a Scott Pilgrim debacle?
/me missed the Friday Scott Pilgrim showing
No idea, I haven't seen it
GGgala, feelsbadpony. you're here NOW though and that's what counts!
Hope you enjoyed the show AE :3
ÅVÄTHRASTA
its good
GGgala, yes as it was rejected one week for the B movie but accepted as an A movie and there is conflicting opinions over what its classified as
Dman: true dat
its an A movie
baby bang? ._.
Ignaesia: ...ah. That does sound like a recipe for wank
Dragon Wars is a movie on the same level as Godzilla in terms of movie levels
the porduction value is rather high
indeedio
which qualifies it as an A movie
hunty it has an A movie budget but its aimed at a niche/cult group which makes it B it was also not critically recieved that well
l8r
What you talking about?
so there was alot of arguing about it
Scott Pilgrim?
03and, time to try Dream world again
but everyone i met loves that movie
You know what's funny. Banzai was driving on the Bonneville Salt Flats in the beginning of the movie. That's in Nevada, not Texas.
Lets talk about ponies instead.
RobotPinkie: I agree to that
there's the 8th dimension part of things.
i say, RobotPinkie, any tips for Fluttershy hair?
i like blues
(srsly)
Pinkie Pie is best pony
the pony blues
Who's your favorite pony?
Barry1: ERRYPONY! \o/
President Madagascar! A man in Brazil is coughing!
SHUT
DOWN
blues is the best ponie, hes been confirmed for season 2
EVERYTHING.
If you had to pick just one, which would it be?
Lawl.
zappity zap zap
Pandemic.
7all ponies is best pony
/me brohoofs AllisZero
true dat sathi
very true
That's not one
>aliens speak english
>wat
i like zacora
Sathi is correct.
03ew
but shes a zebra
so a giant beet heads towards earth and noone sees it.
03I only like plain cheese or pepperoni
03not fish
I dunno, I stopped when I got to a save crystal.
Was really late.
/me brohoofs GGgala
Early.
Same thing.
still qualifies as a pony, unlike some other characters in the serues
Brush the front part of her hair out gently, don't pull too hard, it's better with repeated strokes to even it out it seems. That's about my only tip, Dman. :P
what the hell
!thriller
/me grabs crotch and moonwalks out of the room
series*
Everypony Best Pony http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/304.jpg
Am I the only one who has no idea whats going on in this movie?
7nope
7not only you
No, I don't either
lmfao
hahaha
I'm pretty sure the actors were pretty clueless, too
03ew
i'lll try dat RobotPinkie, thanks
No one knows, this movie is a mystery even to the writers.
/me brohoof Dman
/me 7gave up on it
Ignaesia, the movie makes NO sense unless you've seen it before or do nothing but watch it
hunty: he was PAR-TAY ING!
12i agree drf
/me brohoofs Ignaesia
12pepperoni and cheese is good
i know that but he was in here at like 4 am
hunty: One of my friends woke up, so I was just messing around with him, mixed vodka with all the juice we had in the house
Pinkie Pie said it's time to PAR-TAY!!
it's crows nest not crotch
ahh, fair enough
Screwdrivers of course.
03LOL what
!o3o
diid you make fuck?
/me o3o o3o o3o o3o o3o o3o o3o o3o o3o o3o o3o o3o o3o o3o o3o o3o
SONIC screwdrivers?
so basically aliens from another dimension have come to invade planet earth and some crazy scientist is helping them
12.
12that's a script now?
10dari, you're a cunt
SilverMane: THAT NEEDS TO BE A DRINK
Argh, I'm gonna go take a shower this is never going to work if I don't start
yup
10someone did that to me.
no the scientist has one of them in his brain
13For some reason, yes
13o-o
RainBroDash, and why is that?
Wut
10They put Ouzo in my unmixed pepsi max.....
06erm
ahh ok
12drf didn't you have that set to an autokill word once?
dat greenscreen
12XD
06i can explain the o3o script
10so for replicating their actions i hate you XD
a screwdriver is an alcoholic mixed drink
03yes
06actually
06i cant
HAHAHAHA RainBroDash what a story mark, that's hillarious
10basically i woke up hungover
Lawl.
03get rid of that script
/me RUNS
03we've already asked you nicely
03to get rid of it
10drank so much accidental ouzo
You just mad because you didn't find my house in time.
Silvermare needs to be a drink? Wut?
06no-one said i should get rid of it
10got absolutely slammed first thing in the morning again by accident
03yes
12oh relax drf
that's for those who don't know
10greaaaaaaaat
03I'm pretty sure Aurora told you to get rid of that too
03as there's no point to that script besides pissing me off >_>
oh wow, lower your hackles, Danny
xD
lol RBD
06nope, she never told me too, only if people would ABUSE it
who drinks first thing in the morning?!
RobotPinkie: <SilverMane> SONIC screwdriver?
it's two oh's and a number 3
12XD
not me
Oh, well that makes sense then
only on fridays for me.
sure it does
03yeah, and swear words are just various letters
03what of it
03that does't mean it's not bad
06but since no-one EVER abused my scripts, i'm not going to de-activate them
There is also an alcoholic drink called a sonic screwdriver, made by combining – 1 1/2 oz Vanilla Vodka – 1 1/2 oz Blue Curaçao (liqueur) – 6 oz Clear Lemon-Lime Soda
AWESOME
10WIN
nice
10dari make me one
/me backs away slowly
excellent
It's a screwdriver with something blue in it?
lol
I don't have any of the drinks needed. :<
hypnotic?
13I can understand both sides of this, but I'm leaning more towards drf on this one
it's a rastafarian!
"The "Sonic Screwdriver" recipe was invented by Liz Mulhern of Omaha Nebraska, as a "companion" drink to go along with her favorite TV show. This recipe was inspired by (and named for) the tool of choice used by the main character in the BBC Sci-Fi show "Doctor Who". Read more: Sonic Screwdriver recipe http://www.drinksmixer.com/drinkb1c6388.html#ixzz1VbdyI
a what?!
10dari my mate has the blue curacao. fund it
Crap didn't mean to copy link too! so sorry!
screwdriver+blueberry schnapps?
hypnotic is blue flavored vodka
13It'll take a lot of convincing to get me to believe you made the script for a purpose other than to annoy him :P
I'M BACK
electricity smells?
wait, smell electricity?!
Wtf
Yes, you can.
03^
So,what did i miss?
electricity is supposed to smell of ozone
06why would i even think about annoying drf? i first thought he was joking, and now he's serious..well, no point going into that xD
Arcing electricity through the air creates ozone, which has a distinct odor.
03I can intentionally annoy certain people too, but I'm above that
There's Old Gary.
03unlike some :/
or so I've heard
yeah smells like o-zone
ah I didnt know that
12yeah drf already did plenty of that in the past :P
BUCKAROO WAZZAP
so tesla coils are good for the enviornment?
4Guys, I updated the Steam page for the upcoming LotR special next week
ozone is made when electricity arcs through oxygen
12he's hip and up with the times
so electricity can't exactly smell :)
Satsuma
yea I got popups ;)
ohshi- I recognize him
10Satsuma XD
oshi-
4Yeah, I did too XD
curse cut short
Bjornfot and Pegacorn in the chat at once? ohshi--
Pegacorn is here?
Satsumas are awesome
FFUU
GGgala: LOL
INB4 Rape
PEGACOOOOOOOOOORN<3<3<3<3<3
atomic f-bomb cut short
Ohai Bjornfot
Bjornfot: PEGACROOOOOOOOOOOON. FTFY
06meh, IF i annoy pweople, thats because i'm either being a troll because they did something, or any other specialr easong not to be mentioned in open
yup, that was clancy brown, I knew it.
Dman: you used it! :D
Many typos
06but mainly i make these scripts for shitz and giggles
03...
03watch your language
Anyway
Or for being an idiot .c.
That script is totally useless
03^
lol
I'll ask my parents to get me some blue curacao then.
12i don't quite agree with the situation but let me put it like this, everytime someone activates that script
06but if you REALLY hate the script, and i mean HATE, i will de-activate it, not delete
12so really there is no point to having that script
Leaves from the vine
such logic :/
The.
Fuck.
Falling so slow
03see
06alright then... if you guys insist
Twi's eyes look... brown in S2
03Aurora told me that she told you to disable it
BUCKAROO WAZZAP
03but apparently youd idn't listen LOL
10dari
10do it
SAY WAT.
Attack of the Killer Tomatoes made more sense than this movie
03but yeah
the are brown?
lol
06she never told me to get rid of it nor disable
03my days of intentionally annoying certain people is over
10BAKALOO
Like fragile tiny shells
03I'm trying to be nicer *cough* giving you a free game code*cough*
06only if the script was causing trouble OR getting abused
12drf
That's true, but that's because Attack of the Killer Tomatoes was a masterpiece.
03it causes trouble in that people use it just to annoy me
12i don't think you intentionally annoyed anyone
Drifting in the foam
12your personality was just unlikeable
12XD
03well yeah
03but then people are all
06i know DRF, i never wanted to annoy you in the first place xd
03"Stop being so annoying"
06*xD
Little Soldier boy
03I mean
03I know I talk fast
foam
Come marching home
03but why am I so hateable :<

06disabled
13I'm a complete grammar/spelling nazi by heart, but I only correct people who I know won't get all annoyed over it :3c
03It's not my fault that most people here like products that I don't XD
06someone try !030?
Brave soldier boy
formula give
Comes marching home
EdwardNewgate: ;_;
12i think in the past
12you were kind of a "know it all"
06to test if it IS de-activated?
mfw I just saw that episode
!030
03like on #P-O, I almost never see anything pro-Apple
03and when we do talk about it,e veryone's in agreement that they suck :P
03speaking of which
03I bought two tablets
03HP ones
12ewww HP
Awesome
06erm not a 0 but a o ^^; my bad
So you finally go it
03well
03yeah HML
HP is nice :<
well
03Office Depot got some :)
there we go, better
*got
mfw that was the first ATLA ep i ever saw
ew ew ew
Niice
HP they discontinued their tablets :P
03ctr
03that's why
13What kind of tablet are we talking about here?
me , fma & puto ?
the alien doesn't give a shit
so early :/
How is WebOS?
03HP TouchPad
03HML
03I don't actually have it yet
03I ordered it
Oh
it's sad
06yep, !o3o is disabled :3
I teared up during the song
03will be here on... Wednesday?
Okay then xD
Reptile?
13When I think of tablets, I either think of medicine tablets or drawing tablets o-o
they should've had some more patience
ATlA?
03but yeah ctr
Rainbrodash: What the hay is a Bakaloo?
03that's why they were so cheap
Reptile?
Avatar the last airbender
06o.o
03HP discontinued the TouchPad and made them $100
03instead of $500
oooooh
13!espeon
4Doc Brown PUNCH!
03so I was like DO WANT and bought two
KIACK
Where's Reptile?I don't see him!
03I would have gotten more, but it was a limit of two per person LOL
XD
Luckily, aliens have balls too!
dat truck
03and see
BANZAI!
03Office Depot is sold out again
03so I HOPE they can actually ship mine :/
4Oh yeah, Silverscreen made a Reptile reference last night during this part
03though hmm
03what I could do
so all the aliens are bad?
03is just go to the store
OUTRUN A TRUCK,LIKE A BAWS
This scene totally doesn't reference terminator I & II
We totally need Mortal Kombat: Annihilation in here sometime
03as they said that they'll match the price of officedepot.com
Barry1: "Buccaroo" in a terrible accent
03which has the $149.99 for the 32GB
HELICOPTER OUT OF NOWHERE
MK:A was good in my opinion.
BUKALOO BANZAI
16GB is the $100 I suppose
03yeah
Not bad
bakayarou banzai
4I'd be all for showing MK as A film and Annihilation as B film
03and I mean, I want as much space as possible LOL
dat Commodore 64
03so I got the 32GB for $150
03times two
03I'll probably just sell one to somebody
mk?
64GB of tablet storage xD
03and keep the other
6FUCKAYOU IMHAI
Ghosties,YES PLZ
G-Cipher? It's just that easy.
what is MK?
03they actually have a 64GB TouchPad
4MK as in the first Mortal Kombat film
03but it's extremely hard to find :|
true, the first MK movie isn't that bad and has some good fight scenes. MK:A is lulz
oh
Yet, what is there to download that uses up 32_ GB
03and not on sale
I'm Old Gary.
Aha
03LOL HML
03you obviously don't know me
Ghosties: I totally approve
you and your acronyms
3Total Free: 5570.41 GB/18630.02 GB
dat guy
03I'm using over 10TB right now
Will the tablet replace the Zune?
LOL
Mortal Kombat?
JOHN
03no
4Except MK has ALWAYS been an acronym for the series X3
03you can't fit a 10" tablet in your pocket
03unless you have HUGE pockets
4Yes, GGgala
psh...
03so yeah, nothing will ever replace my 120GB Zune LOL
i knew that
FINISH HIAM! FEITALITEE
...
Huh, another season of Zero no Tsukaima.
Hahah
MK is one of my favorite video game series of all time.
So what do you plan to use the tablet for anyway?
Dem Johns
i cant stand shiva
john conner...?
John O'Connor?
03mainly just trying it out
hey its that dude from Jurassic Park
John ConnOr.
In b4 cybernetic killing machine
and ghost busters
03why would I actually *need* a tablet if I have a laptop
Same idea here :P
John Small Berries?
03that's why I can't understand why anyone would actually want an iPad
03I mean
03those things are like $600
03you can get a laptop for $300 now
john big booty
/me breaks all the zunes in the world to see what drf does
03laptops have more storage andw ay more featurtes...
03*features
Who you gonna call?Someone else.
03but I mean hey
03getting a $600 tablet for $150? Sure
I think that is why the tablet failed in 2003~ xD
any true MK fan has fought Reptile in the first game.
(lol Casper)
03if they had iPads for $150 I'd buy a bunch and then sell them to fanboys
RobotPInkie in the pit!
:P
who read war of the worlds over the radio?
is it racist the black kid is named casper?
Or just raise them to 500 and make epic profit
whoever it was they are pro trolls
Either way, they'll fall for it
That was just brilliant, btw, having a hidden boss like that.
03that's the idea
I didn't fight Reptile in the first MK since i never got far because of the goddamn diffuculty.
fuckin' internet
dat jump
03incidentally, my friend does the same thing with cars
03he buys used cars and sells them, makes money
03I should ask if he can get me a car :/
Old Gary can jump.
Lemons,it was Orson Welles.
Combustiblelemons WotW was a radio dramatic reading, but it was so realistically sounding that some towns believed we really were being invaded
4I fought him, RobotPinkie
Two accidents in a row
Pegacorn, you can finish the entire game with every character without seeing Reptile
How
dat shot
03LOL
03wait what
03no?>
03only the one accident
I know it was. Just I forgot who read it
03but I'm spending a fortune fixing my car
ahh ok
03and my friend was like "You should just sell that before it completely breaks down"
Is this Goonies or Buckaroo Banzai?
JOHN FINFOOK
I mean, two car screwups
Haha
03apparently the blue-book value is like $5000
03for my car
4And Pegacorn, you think MK1 is difficult?
BB
2nd movie, Barry
03which is more than I expected for an 11 year old SUV
4Play MKII
no fat kids, so its not goonies
ah, so I missed the lottery
4Now that game *trembles*
Nice, a SUV
Hrm
ever fight kintaro on MK2? yeah
03SUVs are nice
also, no sloth, so it's not the goonies
12heh
ALL MK games are hard to me.
03they just have CRAPPY gas mileagfe
03-f
03guess how many miles per gallon I get :/
12i have an 07 PT Cruiser
