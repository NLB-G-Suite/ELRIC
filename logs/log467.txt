04What's wrong with being called Napalm? :P
04That's a pretty badass nickname
lemme guess, is it because you blew up things during chemistry class?
yes, a viscous acidic combustable liquid designed to kill
if that was the case half of our school would have that nickname
which dissolved skin while burning people alive
great nickname
natural gas outlets
Hiya BronyState!!!
and matches
hiya CrazyCherry
ohai CrazyCherry
heya CrazyCherry
04But it's such an ACTION NAME
04NAPALM
like a badass codename
it's better than cheezles
GilDash is probaply so angry at me right now....
why
Ah wasn't here yesterday...
04Because he obviously ate all of GilDash's raspberries
04I would be angry too
I think you have an unhealthy obsession Ghost :P
/me gives Ghosties some raspberries
and some lemons
any idea Where xmasskills went?
/me noms raspberries
Ghosties: How do you know what he's angry at me?
Ghosties: do u still h8 it when people lick u?
04It's not an unhealthy obsession, Life_Essence, it's just my food of the day
i dont mind if its in chat
04I don't know, Crazy
04And yes, no licking me
Imma playing minecraft.
but NO IRL
Ghosties: apparently Twi_Fi is scared of u
CrazyCherry pc or xbox
Pc
awesome
or handheld
oh and Ghosties can i ask u a question?
04NO
04.......................................................................................................yes
too late you've already been asked
lol
04What is your question
umm Ghosties itss related to my head phones umm when i bend the cables a little bit the sound cuts in and out? wut do i do
04Well first
Ghosties: should i just send it back to the company
"Can I ask you a question" "You didn't really give me a chance to object"
dat tech question
04You put them in a trash compactor
04Then
lol
04You take out what's left (whatever's salvageable), then you reconstruct the core of a nuclear reactor
04Then
04You apply duct tape
04And you're good :D
then profit!
note to self dont ask Ghosties a tech question
Now where's my wood....
So ghosties, what do you do when there is a netsplit
Mere coal.
04In all honesty I just keep bending and twisting the wire until I get sound in both phones back, but typically, in my experience, it's a sign that they're dying
04Well
04When there's a netsplit
04First
^ then tape then in the postition they work XD
04You get an IRCop
04Then
Where the hell is my axe?
04You tell them that if they do not have catfish that they should really invest in the tuna market
04Then
04You go to said market (catfish or tuna, either doesn't matter as both will work) and confront the manager
04From there you ask him for the secret password
this is the best tech advice ever
^
04And if he doesn't give you the password then he's a filthy commie, and you should just tar and feather him
04And that's how you fix a netsplit
my sides
oh god
it's like if tech advice was an Adventure Game
04Glad I could help
not really
Dem red text walls....
for a netsplit
thats reasonable advice
just wait it out
Ghosties: You didn't just help. You made my night.
/me salutes
/me shovel salutes
Sword salutes.
/me fail....
04Schwartz salutes
TheRainbowDash :3

RaveBrony: Some amazing tech advice from Ghosties
04I'm a fan of blue-bladed fans, so I feel your pain
Getting timber mod for minecraft....
04There's just no conventions on the wonders of blue-colored fan blades .___.
Ghosties poor you

04I know :(
Ghosties: Man, that sucks...:D
04Maybe one day
XAX: Ah :)
I go nuts over birch wood ceiling fans myself.
04Maybe one day I'll make a convention
04On the wondrous things
NADSOP
04Known as blue-colored blades on fans
Lol :D
Yeah, the Ghosties's convention for the Wub of Blue Blades, or some shit like that.
Wow my internet is lagging way too much....
04And for the floor I'll just have the one fan I could find
04And I'll charge $230 a pop to glance at it from a 5 foot distance
...oh shucks. I got finals tomorrow. Oh well, enjoying my last 10 days of school.
No offense, but blue-bladed fans seems like something out of a baby's room.
TheRainbowDash: y u no listen to me
Hiya Twi_Fi!!!

Airpuff: max payne 3 multiplayer
Shane377|Angry: oo
04You know, one of the best things about Saints Row The Third: They left the zombies in the game on that one island after the campaign concludes
really?
04Endless entertainment and no police to bother you
Max Payne 3 my ass! Diablo 3 looks flipin Awesomeshy !
there r unicorns on diablo 3 verp
Sounds a bit like Dead Rising...but only a teeny(?!) tiny bit
Hello
derp
Hey Resonantwaves !
Ghosties: sometimes theres a glitch where the zombies dont spawn and normal ppls r there
04If you haven't played either titles, go play them
Ghosties: i love games wich have supernatural stuff
like bioshock
Ghosties: i thought u typed funniest
i was like wtf
Onyxia: silent hill?
04Bioshock isn't what I'd consider 'supernatural'
Is funnest the correct komperative(?!?!?!?!)
04But yeah, Silent Hill could be considered 'supernatural'
would be interesting
Shane377|Angry: never played it
What do I even say?!
my brother played it on the ps2
i watched him play for 10 mins
never playing again
xD

Am I the only pony around here who thinks Bronystate needs more Pony emotions?

04It needs more raspberries
raspberries? Well why not?:D
Ghosties: do u kno if the room ban things are time based?
04Indeed, why not? *pours raspberries on the chat*
Shane377|Angry: isnt it 1 hour?
/me cracks knuckles "lets hope so"
04Bans usually aren't time based unless the person timebans on principle
/me eats rapsberries
Ghosties: so u have no idea about channel bans ?
04I do, but what I'm saying is that if someone banned you normally then they're permanent depending on the type of ban they placed
oh gr8

Airpuff: well, we believe in you! :)
Phase4: i used to be a sick mofo on CS surfin like a boss xD
Sylandest: Thanks :P
00,02XD
Da fuuuuuu
My mind
is full of bananas.
:3
Twi_Fi: custom maps, lol. You can do many many things
Twi_Fi: bananas, you say?
Twi_Fi: ... bananas?.......
Tea. Huzzah. :3
potato?
Phase4: .. you have lots to learn.. xD
welcome back, Meanwhile!
00,02Airpuff, ikr
Meanwhile: :|
Dat leg snap.
Meanwhile: Hello :D
Hai Twi_Fi.
00,02hence why i go scout
00,02training wheels
Twi_Fi did you already try to fry a banana?
Meanwhile: ... Good.
I move away from the surf to go scout.
Oh hai Wrek.
Wait dat ain't Wrek.
Invi: No, why would I do that? Such blasphemy.
lold.
Twi_Fi but it is soo delicious O_O
Phase4: lemme give ya a tip. Look downwards.. then go upwards quickly before looking down, making you jump of the surf and making you jump longer
do a 360 off it!
Invi: frying a banana is delicious?
oh god yes
00,02hmmm
but only if you do it right
Phase4: FaN is part of the achievement rewards.
00,02i'll try that
00,02Meanwhile, ah
Invi: I have never attempted it, lol
I love how the scout falls to his death but stops in mid-air, like it's too much trouble to fall al the way.
The others for the scout milestones being the Bonk and the Sandman,
Sylandest look up the recipe and try it. it's worth it ^^
Invi: the last time I tried to legitimately cook something, I triggered the fire alarm in my dorm...:$
00,02i'm killing me btw, have it bound to k
wut? lol
On tha day i decied to get Diablo 3 Blizzard decieds to preform "scedualed matnice"...I hate this
Like all the pros do.
NOOOOOOOOOO
Invi: yep, true story
Phase4: .. try a curvy motion sorry i just said up and down xD
|Discord|: they have it every tuesday or so, i believe
Wooo Crack
00,02hmmm
Sylandest: I know...but why THIS tuesday?
NOOOOOOOOOOOO
well i triggered too the firealarm several times at home because cooking :$ but fire alarms are overrated
so i turned it off ^^
Fun Fact: There are some restaurants where you can order ANY deep fried food: pizza, banana, candy bar - you name it
|Discord|: I actually don't know, because I don't think there's any big patch incoming. There's been no announcements
Follow me doctor! Yadadadada
tuesday? better write a friendship letter to Princess
SirGanjalf: What a revolting concept.
Invi: I can't turn them off at the dorm...lol
valoreins: but we have learned nothing! :O
Hammers turn off fire alarms.
oh god
Phase4 why you no play reg TF2?
00,02|Discord|, what fun is there in that?
Reg TF2 is overrated.
Twi_Fi: But then I get sued for property damage...:(
SLAG gaming is where it's at.
Phase4: I guess you are right?
Sylandest then avoid frying things ^^
no, we will learn something today, i'm sure of it
Invi: I just wanted to cook a steak...:D
Meanwhile: yep, http://www.odditycentral.com/pics/new-york-restaurant-will-deep-fry-anything-you-want.html

I only heard it once, when it was read after the Tom Awards
00,02|Discord|,
00,02sole survivor
HELLYA
what's coming?
i only listened to a dramatic reading of it
Well... I won't cry over everything, even this didn't make me cry, but I've felt sad after I finished it.
i heard jenomorph is making a MLD movie or sumthin
00,02had to check bronystate stuff
And I still feel sad.
00,02stream will start itself again
we know dat feel malavolent
who is still on TF2?
me
Also, on unrelated note, I might check every cardboard box I find from now on.
Lil_B:
I might try to read MLD at a time when getting depressed will now effect anything important in the immediate future.
noted
*not
But the story itself was so entertaining that it took me only like 20 minutes to read it all.
I think someone is already making a short movie based on this, I'm looking forward to it.

hes making a MLD movie
Is it him?
I AM BACK

It's not really a big thing, but I'm happy I'm making small progress: fav.me/d50wrkq
Indeed. :D
Malavolent: you just earned yourself a watcher :D
Oh I remember that one.
Malavolent is it ok if i ad you as a friend on DA?
Yeah... Good lines.
panda: Well thank you, sir :D
Lil_B: But of course, go on.
Malavolent: octavia is my fav background pony... and who ever draws her.... is mah best friend D:
Ninjazz: Really? I guess it's truth if more people say so. I still need a lot of practice though.
panda: She is one of my favourites too. :)
/me is only person without favourite background pony
so who all is on this server
Lil_B: why? :D
/me is enjoying the sounds of combat.
Still good, Malavolent. Looks good.
brony_swan: I've watched the MLD trailer.
The animation of Dashie is surprisingly good.

panda I don't know, I just don't see something special about them :/ not even Derpy
pyrocatboy: its so.... eroooootic
hang on im in game
Ninjazz: Thanks, guess who's next to draw? :D
Well, you don't need a favorite, Lil_B.
Bacon[Hazard] Better than any kind of music.
damn right
Malavolent: You should draw... Lyra is always a popular choice.
Ninjazz: I don't have any strong feelings for Lyra, but I might draw her someday.
Bacon[Hazard] ... we're sick fucks, aren't we?
Why can't I hold all these Bonbons?
The next one is Trixie, though.
pyrocatboy: Indeed.

CrazyCherry: havent seen ya in a while! haha
panda: True, true.

Could I ask the mods a quick question? Would Battle Royale qualify as an A-movie, a B-movie, or neither?
I like Speed Dodgeball better though
panda: No, where have YOU been?
THERE WAS TWO AFTER ME|

So nobody knows?
00,02you heard that right

Perhaps you should consult Imdb, Reikim.
I'm trying to fill out my survey form, but I'm not sure in which category to place it...
For that matter, not sure whether it would actually be permitted here.
ehh Ninjazz no specific mood today?
Tired.
Want me to put the tag up? :$
oh;)
Reikim: You would be surprised.
Ninjazz: Okay, it doesn't explicitly say A/B, so how should I go about this?
No one has taken the Battle net tag name "Discord" yet. I just did
Okay... Let me check this out for myself. Battle Royale was it?
Ninjazz: Yup.
Alright.

Glad to have you back WallDives :)

How long were you out of power, WallDives?
We're not allowed to pick documentaries for our movie choices, right?
Wow. Watching someone watch someone play a a video game. Truely we are through the looking glass :D
I'm sure you can pick one FillyFlam.
Kandarihu: it was out when I woke up, so...more than 4 hours.
It's all up to the mods whether or not they'll show it.
http://blip.tv/joshscorcher/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-a-canterlot-wedding-review-6166403
Ninjazz: Oh, sweet.
12good luck with that :3
03it's on Friday, but thanks
/me breaks the chat silence

Wow. A few weeks ago, I had a power outage that lasted for one hour. It was freaky seeing my laptop running on battery power while nothing else ran... not even my fridge or router.
Laptop > fridge
00,02dinners cooking

Why are we talking about MY power outage? That was weeks ago. WallDives just came back from an even longer one.
/me shrugs
Anyway, welcome back to the internet, WallDives.
yay for being in the middle of nowhere. cant wait until I move to somewhere with a backup generator.
I've had
Can you compare that to having your router screw up and not have internet for 2 days?
In total, one call for an interview
Turns out 2 days is a lot longer than you might think...
That was summer 2010 :I
/me twitches
WallDives: you can buy your own generator, you know. Even if you live in an apartment complex, you can run it from a balcony.
03well, >co-op jobs
Kandarihu: its a money issue, I'm a unemployed student.

Funny thing about GRUB and Mint is that you can hibernate Windows and Mint and be able to resume from either
14xD
da majicks
very carefully
Dat speedreading
FUCK DE MAJICKZ
14how are you two? :3
Petrified_Discord: and backwards reading
Bomberman. Never played this game.
da saiense
I'm okayish
03HML why is that funny o.o
03all hibernation does is make an image file
I played the old Bomberman on PC though, so I think I can probably adapt.
03that it boots from
03LOL
08,01are any of you familiar with the fundamental dogma of electronics?
Because Windows 7 likes to hog the resume
Zap shit?
and when I dualbooted XP and 7
No.
Don't spill water on it?
only bomberman I played was on the gameboy
I don't think so... :S
08,01there are 2 principles of the dogma
I could only hibernate and resume from 1 OS
/me gets a pen and some paper
08,01the first is that all electronics contain magic smoke, which is what makes them work
xD
OF COURSE!
magic smoke, got it
08,01the second is that if the magic smoke escapes, the electronics will no longer work
._.
Everytime... :|
lol
08,01i managed to make the magic smoke escape on the RCD in my shed
Dem magic electronics..
This is epic.
08,01so it no longer works
But now your shed is magical.
Ninjazz: Boo
08,01i just recently bought an electric lawnmower, and was mowing the very long grass
Oh shut up, Om.
08,01suddenly, it stopped working, so i went to check out the RCD in the shed
Wait... Hey Om!
08,01(for those who don't know what an RCD is, think of it as a fuse box. if there's too much current, it will shut everything off)
08,01so, on this RCD unit, there is a button marked test
Ninjazz: You're a slow one aint cha?
Om: Tired as hell, more like.
08,01the 'test' button *should* overcurrent the RCD and switch everything off
08,01y'know, to test
Ninjazz: Ahh, cant blame you for that
wha?
Om: No you can't. You can never blame me for anything.
08,01instead, the test button was, at this moment, not the test button, but the 'release magic smoke' button
lol
08,01this situation has a pro and a con
08,01pro: i don't need to mow the grass anymore
Ninjazz: Not fairly anyway
*smoke, damn.
Pro: It works. Con: You get electrocuted.
08,01con: i now need to replace the RCD
True.
KABOOOM
um, stupid question time.
So, Om. What has been going on for the past 2 days while my freakin router decided to break?
does england/United Kingdom have a professional hockey league?
the UKHL?
08,01anyhoos
Ninjazz: Ehh, nothing much. Tho, there was a while where Gillysuit could not do what she does. And I took full advantage of that
08,01today is proving to be interesting
Technology: noun. Anything that does something cool, but you don't know how it works. If it breaks, you have to buy a new one.
08,01i got my delivery of Club Mate, whic is awesome
08,01my shed exploded, which is not
Om: Banned or something? :S
Om: wait, when was this? Did the mods finally tell him/her to knock it off?
08,01and i have a phonecall later than i'm very nervous about
08,01which is both good and bad
Ninjazz: Nope.
WallDives: And yeah
Om: hai what are ya talkin about?
Heh. I was expecting her to be banned by the time I got back. :S
Bee?
Well, time for a TF2 break.
Airpuff: Nothing much
Lemonade...so awesome
What's going on in here atm?
not sure
Om: Hmpf, very well then. How's your day been?

In other news, http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-omgtoys.gif
Pinkies4thWall you need to have an account in good standing to upload a vid that's >15 mins
RAWRity: how to reg to do so?
You shouldn't light a match when you smell magical smoke.
I think its normally capped at 20 mins or something :s

RAWRity: http://images.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw2933-1329602553300.gif
00,02what the heck is going on
Phase4: Smash bros.
partying reasonably sucks. either be a good DD, or get plastered/be the last person standing.
you tell me
Look out for pyros.
So much Rarity...
Phase they are posting hilarious links
Me likey.
Smash Fortress?
Dat bat.
So...how bout that new season of Red Vs Blue?
sentry launched
So...what's Red Vs Blue.
:I
I dont like halo, and I know what RvB is...
from what ive seen red vs blue has the same jokes over and over
The next Smash Bros. needs Kingof The Hill mode, just sayin
/me shrugpony.
A popular series of Halo Machinima.
twilight_sprinkler: then you're seen wrong.
*King of
PartyCannon: the next smash bros needs actual fighting game mechanics.
WallDives: We already have that. It's called any other fighting game :)
PartyCannon that be a good idea I tell ya hwat
RAWRity: riiiiite
I kinda just stopped watching RvB after the third season I think.
:D
what Petrified_Discord said
Und then Phase4 brought the Slag Shop up.
Petrified_Discord: yes, but I hate the ensuing bitchfest that comes with the SSBB arguement.
the next Smash Bros needs a 16 character roster, and a bunch of DLC character options.
How many games will it take to figure out I wonder.
Batter derp.
also, it should have On-disc DLC
No items Final Destination? Fuck that. ALL ITEMS ON SUMMIT.
RAWRity and they need to be on the disc
We should play Demoknights only.
*THey
All Items on, 200m, READYGO!
Nintendo hasn't gotten into the whole DLC game, have they?
nope
Kandarihu: not really.
Good.
They've dabbled in it
they're still puzzled by online gaming
Nintendo hasn't gotten in to much that they haven't already done a billion times already.
With Nintendo Wi-Fi Plus or whatever it was called
That's how Nintendo works.
03http://chzschooloffail.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/homework-class-test-looks-like-i-need-a-number-pen.png
OR, you could say Nintendo did DLC first with pokemon.
Nintendo makes more couch multiplayer games.
wii doesn't have a hdd so they can't really do dlc
and the first Casino in Ohio is supposed to open today.
LOL SAT/ATC/TerraNova test
I remember those
03TerraNova?
yo
03http://chzdatingfails.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/dating-fails-saving-you-from-two-hours-of-vampiric-romance.jpg
i have a nintendo DS since... oh god i dont remember
So most of the people on this map are playing Scout, I see? Inspired by the Smash Bros theme to go with the character who double jumps?
Onyxia: have had mine since 2004.
So, less than a month til B/W 2 releases in japan!
Dken2021: good point.
02LOL
RAWRity: YES.
gtg bye!

Ninjazz: Pokemon Black/White 2
WallDives: i see :p
Ninjazz: Pokemon Black/White 2.
Oh.
Thanks. :$
CANNOT WAIT
also, 1 month until pokemon conquest comes out here.
I'VE HAD IT WITH THESE MOTHER FUCKING SNAKEMEN IN THAT MOTHER FUCKING UNDERGROUND POOL!
Pokemon the return of the revenge of the rehash.
02http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2008/06/fb147.jpg
god damn it Japan! just start translation earlier, and release them at the same time!
Pokemon Black and White 2: electric boogaloo
03http://chzdatingfails.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/dating-fails-to-answer-your-question-yes.jpg
03LOL
Und then Phase4 went to the mooooooooon
That was a good one.
PartyCannon: where do i go to verify my account
?
not really, remember, GSC was a direct sequal.
and the original title being Pokemon 2.
RAWRity: I'd give you my Kanji study ds study guide, but it's also untranstlated :P
Ima log for a while, talk to you guys later.
Bye
bye Airpuff.
WallDives: of a sort. Though you didn't find out about that until afterwards.
seeya Airpuff
this video took a whole day to save on my computer
Cya Airpuff! Stay puffy!
00,02Meanwhile, ikr
02lmao
Seeya Airpuff
Pinkies4thWall I can't link it directly cause my account is verified already. See the help article I posted
bye Airpuff :D
RAWRity: naturally.
Ninjazz: Always :P
:)
>viagra commercial in class
Ow.
RAWRity: the least you can do is draw the symbols :P but unless you can read kanji, it has no other purpose
RAWRity: I'm almost afraid to ask, but how's your literary stuff doing?
although, B/W actually had a storyline this gen., so I'm actually interested to see what B/W2 adds.
B/W 2 is in the same region, 2 years later, with several characters showing up from the last one.
03http://artoftrolling.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/internet-troll-thats-so-sweet.png

Ninjazz: I just love the reference.
Allo mitamaking.
...I dont know how I feel about that, seriously. Like I thought I'd be repulsed and outraged, but I'm all "meh" about it.
I see no reference, RAWRity. And I'm not calling you one of them.
Does anyone play Team Fortress 1 anymore?
Malavolent : I don't think it is. -gags-
Well, this is why everyone hates us. :S

Ninjazz: the photo I posted is shopped with a reference to a manga.
oh.
No wonder.
cya bros on the flip side...catcha l8er
bai brony_swan.
WallDives: it's what the internet's done to us. We no longer get outraged by perverted stuff like that.
Cya brony_swan.
Personally, my first reaction was "Oh internet, what WON'T you try to fuck?"
hey guys
hi alexxm.
If i was a bit younger in my fandomhood, i probably would be disgsuted.
Hey alexxm!
RAWRity: No exceptions.

Well, you can't make an omelet without starving some dwarves.

WallDives: Well screw them
WallDives: they just jelly

Ninjazz: good attitude, hehehe

It's worked for me.
I don't often play the competitive games, because once I get into a niche and master a character, folk get mad and ragequit...:$
Nothing works for me.
too bad I get destroyed when I go to a actual tournament, although its more for getting matched up against sponsored players.
/me pats Om on the back
Om: you just haven't found the right strategy yet. You'll find one!
thanks
/me hugs Om
Om: practice. srs.

on the flipside, I got free drinks, free admission to a con in december, and a chorus of boos.
i just stick to the easy mode where you can do special and super moves by pressing a buttin
/me sighs
what for WallDives
Sylandest: no, I need to play better and win, the PR comes on its own. besides, I eat hatemail. NOMNOMNOM.

this ipod app is amazing
Anypony here watch the Amvs i linked?
thats unfair, although for me.
that's kind of an oxymoron
also, thats old and I was REALLY n00by.
it's not a joke
it's an app of this like 40 dollar game
which one were you?
is it a dungeon crawler?
I have to get on my other computer to watch it, so i'll let you know when I see it
40 dollar board/card game
no
oh
Ascension
np.
hii glacy
it's this game made by magic players
I was gonna say, because ubisoft pulled that one
;p
with a vita launch game
also, thats where I got the nick from :(
where the goal is to make the best deck
02"OS X Mountain Lion"
Anypony here watch the Amvs i linked?
02for a little bit I thought they were joking
pyrocatboy: no.
pyrocatboy they were ok
I still read that as vineyard o.o
WallDives : Do you want to?
EW VITA
so you were vega?
I'll scroll up and look at them later.
Dken2021: yeah.
WallDives: cherilee is a whore :(
WallDives : ok
02Vita looks pretty good if you ask me :P
Wait... no stream?
02although EW back touch screen
yes but you also think the 3DS is good
/me runs
eenope
then.... watch this?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BZBysLAVUc
panda: You would know >.>
Honda/Claw is a 6-4 disadvantage for Claw.
02I think the 3DS is good for something Nintendo would make XD
Om: oh hi... i didnt see you there
panda: Funny thing, I've seen that like 10 times but still laugh.
Ninjazz: gosh... about 20 times here.... XD
it could definately use just a little more glitter
/me sneaks increaced to 23
/me wants to see DRF and HML argue over the 3DS
Ninjazz: needs MAOR LITTER!
GLITTER.
since usually you two like/dislike the same products
Ninjazz: ninja'd again :D
02does HML like or dislike the 3DS?
02I can't tell
IMO, 3DS>>>Vita, but both are good in their own ways
he likes it
Not really.... What the hell is LITTER? :D
Yeah
02ah
well
Ninjazz: I thought it said litter :s
Ninjazz: another form of glitter? XD
He isn't a ninja, he just distracs ponies with his diamond plot
the fact I've paid for two 3DSes
panda: but I dont have cats, and I dont want to be arrested, so why would I need moar litter?
I obviously don't hate it
its just a major disappointment
drf should give me one
WallDives: arrested? O__o for catts?
for LITTERING.
next time I gift one... LOL
For cheaper price than GameStop is asking for refurbished
Ninjazz: PUNCH!!!!!!!!!
panda What a CATastrophy.
wall.. you are stupid XD
coooooomming
oh howdy, panda!
EW GAMESTOP
Sylandest: :D herro ^^
02don't worry, drf just gives stuff away for free
Amazon or GTFO
GameStop makes it $10 off original price
:I
I've tried second hand stores
panda: how are you today?
They never have any used 3DS
PAWNCH
use Amazon or eBay
Sylandest: good :D and yourself?
Maybe
Ninjazz: do you think miss cherilee and miss cherilee should get married?
And BlueFlare, -_-
the 3DS so far has good software, good apps/downloadable games, and it has a great community behind it
I don't just give things away
I still need that PS2 of yours too :P
02pro tip: Say you hate Apple stuff when you says he got a new 3DS. Then you'll have one
panda: *throws up*
/me runs
02he*
there are only a couple things about it I'm disappointed with and they are relatively minor
panda: im doing good, if a little bored with no stream. its a good day off from work though! :D
Sylandest: haha well... do what I do when there is no stream :D
02same Kosovo
the only good games so far are remakes
cameras suck
resolution sucks
>Resident Evil Revelations
Ninjazz: um... you know... the scootaloo parts make me a tad uncomfortable :s
etc
panda: what do you do?
hey panda hows your day been
to each their own, I hate games like that
02Super Mario 3D land was good
panda: I find those HILLARIOUS. :D
Ohhhh! Coooommmme!
It was annoying
Sylandest: XD ijust derp around, draw and write?
yeah but Mario is Mario
Levels were too short
02true drf XD
Drf
KH 3D should be good when it comes out but I'm not a fan of the voice acting (aside from the TWEWY characters)
DSi X
panda: I can do the writing bit, but not drawing. Stickmen be my limit
02but there's 100 of them Chim
*XL
Mario is Metroid you dumba-
meh KH
I really need to quit being lazy and level up the rest of my pokemon..

WallDives: lol, good idea
I don't worship the series or whatever but I do enjoy it
they're all L75. Need to get them to 100...
TST had super KH fangirla

02did you hears?
coooooooooooooooooommmmmmmmmmmmmmmiiiiiiiiingggggggggggggg
panda: *george takei here*
panda: the accent annoys me too much to even think about that.
Ninjazz: im sos >.>
02They're working on a new Zelda game for the 3DS that's not a remake
WallDives: what accent?
panda: Real sos.
and a new castlevania
the high-pitched southern one?
WallDives: apple blooms?
yeah.
which is going to be 2D but I liked Dawn of Sorrow so I'm not complaining
this guy makes the best tutorials http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KH4NrUxcsYs
02well, 2D can be 3D if you know what I'm saying XD
02things can still pop out
did you hear? if you look out a window, everything is in 3D!
WallDives: :( but... i like her accent...
yeah, but I mean it controls on a 2D plane
02Really?!

02drf, unless it's real life, all 3D is fake
exactly.
/me glomps Shizuka and runs away with her before she can start streaming
going to get diner back soon

is like getting crosseyed
Why does BlueFlare bring up irrelevant things when drf never said 3D is fakr
e
Naw, the mod stole our mod
o.o
if Brave New World is correct, movies will be truly 3D because you'll be directly involved in them o.o

Irish_Pony: 2 bits, and that's final
/me Meow
Shee liiikes him ~
thanks
www
03and got it out of demo mode
03apparently you have to modify some firmware
03not just the unlock codes
/me dusts Mish.
ohhm
lol
03but, apparently I can modify 4.11
03to enable package installation
Guys, don't worry. They'll respawn.
hai Rain
Forced sexy time...
Airpuff: anime: the only reality where killing someone means you love them
SayWhat: :|...Two Bits....Thats it?
"You're next" *dies next*
hi im back my internet died D:
03if that actually works, that would be amazing LOL
Sylandest1: I guess xD
Irish_Pony: :|
to install unsigned packages?
13that's me all over
you internet is dead, why are you here?
03Yep
hai TheDamShadow01
03http://www.ps3hax.net/2011/10/released-ps3mfw-builder-0-2-1/
doggy!
Inb4 boom.
03I had to use it on 3.55
Shizuka: .. you ofthen stream anime? :P
Cwute!!!
I dislike dogs
A lot.
save the puppy, that is clearly fake
Its a bomb
But kitties are fun :3
Offering herself for a plushie xD
03since, there's a spcial flag "promotional to retail" you have to use to permanentny unlock
What, not the puppy!!
:(
Hi Michael
03since, those unlock codes are one time use only, every time you restart the system it re-locks
xD
A guy and a girl alone in a dark cave...
03and it'll prevent you from updating to non-promo firmware
Adorable things are her weakness? Really?!:D
TIME FOR RAPE!
03so I updated to 3.55 official by modifying it with that
2 left >:) and the episode only began
what anime is this???
iMusik: Tom Sawyer all over again
Ponies are her weakness
03but you can modify 4.11 with that as well, and there's a box "allow unsigned packages"
03so LOL
TheDamShadow01: "Angel's Beats"
Irish_Pony: down boy
Irish_Pony: "Thumbs up"
Total times kicked now : 4
:P
Sylandest1: No, not down, up!
/me points to a rainbowdash (doll) thats about to explode with a time bomb
Thanks TheRainbowDash
so? get it!
13time for some heartbreaking back story
TheRainbowDash: Angel beats* xD
Plot inc!
also, is there a way without installing linux to copy-decrypt PS3games?
Airpuff: Whatever, whatever...:D
Suddenly, character depth.
The plot thickens!
Ahh her sotry is quite... sad :'(
whoo! Heartfelt moment!
/me is now watching tv
Irish_Pony: Oh my....o_o
Airpuff: wait, wat
13Airpuff: everyone's is
03yes
Oh noooo
03multiman does it
03the games are decrypted by the PS3 BD drive
Shizuka: .. i guess..
Redwall & Mossflower location found - now for some terraforming
:O
I'm just reading what's on the right side of my screen while Japanese language comes out of my speakers. L00l
03so just use a package manager, install it to a USB drive
03and you'll have decrypted files
Shizuka: but hers.. are just sad....
03I already tried it
13ja
Shizuka: Sad backstory+ god animation= good anime.
*good
i like Mirai Nikki
sad? :(
TheDamShadow01: agree.. its awesome xD Quite... gore though
such an odd anime...then again, I did step out for a fair portion
pff... sad backstories are over-rated... everyone has one of those, its kinda boring...
Sylandest1: You lost 1 episode. xD
Omg.. this soundtrack..
Airpuff: yep
is there a way without installing linux to copy-decrypt PS3games TO ISO?
Beautiful music in this anime if you noticei t.
Airpuff: that one episode could've meant everything!!
i dont notice cause im not watching it...
all dat blood
Sylandest1: Pretty much your understanding of the whole bottom plot xD
D:
xD
Airpuff: Oh my, that plot...o_o:D
someone needs to revise all of the scripts so that prince-lemon is exempt from the kick
Airpuff: why did you say plot....agh my brain!
03um
03use ImgBurn to creat an ISO? :P
Somepony give me some brain bleach
03*create
Crap I missed everything agian
03there's nothing special formatting-wise about PS3 games
XI
TheRainbowDash: .. I'll give ya some of it.. all the people there have died irl, and ended up there, to... say rebel against god for their unfair life.
i thought you said it's encypted?
03and what would you do with teh ISO anyway? All of the package managers, you have to extract them first
03it is
03but it's a regular disc
03the PS3 decrypts on its own
Airpuff: ...I wasn't talking about that plot.
lol
TheRainbowDash: ah Okei xD
TheRainbowDash: lol....*sweatdrops at Airpuff*
Airpuff: Good that you know.:D
his hair just went behind his eye
?ME FACehoof at Airpuff

Thanks for the stream, Shizuka.
Om: Oh hush now and let me be a happy drunk :)
to be fair, streamers, then mods word, is final
02!Shipping
Irish_Pony: As you wish.
13streamers are mods
if they say stop, might want to listen
02!Shipping
Shizuka: phase4 is a techie
02hurr
he streams Shizuka
02ohai
13I'm not playing the semantics game today.
hey derp_derp hows your day been
I mean, streamer has final word, but if a mod in general says stop, then you might want to listen :)
RyunosukeKnT: No kidding.. xD
13When a mod says stop, you stop.
13End of story.
if shizu was streaming, and sumi says stop, still listen :)
00,03No respect, no respect...
I feel oppressed now. :P
02zo Skylands
/me hugs Shizuka
then leave :|
10And if you really want to impress me: mash something up with Agmen clientum, Venari strigas, or Symposium magarum
02what's ur favorite color of 3DS?
Shizuka: but shouldn't we all be equal?
I respect the mods as long as their decisions are fair, if they're not i will argue. But i will not keep on doing whats "wrong" but i will want to hear a raeson. xD
CCCP, um, no
cccp no this isnt a democracy :)
10None
D:
Airpuff: same
10I don't even know what colours it comes in
13Not when it involves making jokes about rape.
^
shits not funny in any way
Shizuka: Agreed. Really just isnt funny.
Blue
:D
yea^
It comes in Blue Black Red and recently, purple
agreed
I agree with that completely.
rawr
whut?
hi
eep
I need some help...
!shipping
Hello flutter_spin
to be honest, this shouldnt even be discussed, he should have had a warning, then ban, then end of story
/me gasps
i need some help with something guys
;c
hi flutter_spin
whats up Alicorn_Prince_Shane
!shipping
I respect the mods as well, because not only Bronystate is a site for everything, no, it's a growing family, and family is one of the most importaint element of life, and we love you guys.
02Blacks, white (coming soon), purple, pink, dark blue, aqua blue, and red
Ryunosuke, he did get a warning, and then he got banned
I need an explanation
13That you need to get a warning about making jokes about rape brings me tremendous sadness.
10I like the blue one
oh
13There is no excuse at all.
10That shade of red is horrifying
Claude is getting really angry at me for getting banned
02^
so?
Tough. >_>
02Flare red
lawl
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: is it your foault?
Tough luck
02Flame*
10Needs more http://i.walmartimages.com/i/p/11/13/00/02/06/1113000206137_500X500.jpg
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: you in a PM?
Right so this sites already going crazy so im just gonna go knock out a tank or two...brb
he was apparently warned, and disregarded said warning
being banned is no fun
The shade of red for the 3ds sucks
Kriel_Pony: nope not my fault
/me happens to know a few folks who would most certainly not find that "joke" very funny.
D
D;
lul
shiz said stop
so i stopped
02are you sures Jet?
CK|Ded: uh oh
claude kept going
!shipping
oh. Did I join a banishment party?
ohai mystic
then there is nothing to contest imo
Then it was claUDE'S FAULT
boring party
oops sorry caps lock
Obsidian: basically
what did you need help with, flutter_spin?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsK4RAAgTRM&feature=BFa&list=PLE3A0309D71C33362
um Shizuka
what would happen if everyone except Tom was permabanned?
Banned is an cruel thing, it's takes everything away from you, because let face it, the person that's got banned has no social life whatsoever.
Yes
o:
02I like black and purple 3DS the most
I'm still looking at this comic and I don't get it at all. People say its brilliant and ... well, I don't get it
13I have no sympathy for someone who makes such callous jokes.
I like blue
:3
^
banned even from bronystate
VenHur96: I have actually had worse
Sky
that DS was mine
x3
13Use the ignore feature of your IRC client.
02which blue?
02dark blue or aqua blue
02?
10Female German voices are manly
which comic?
VenHur96: No need to go on a personal assault.
Aqua o:
they are
flutter_spin: I think Rainbow Dash lost her ability to speak, so Pinkie did her fourth wall breaking thing to use the author's drawing software to resolve the issue
02ah
he's lucky he didnt get k-lined
Shizuka: how does one appeal a ban?
flutter_spin: Take a closer look at the final pannel
RyunosukeKnT & everyone else: i vote we talk about something else = u=
10And male German voices sound like they're mad
VenHur96: he got banned, he did something bad, do not try to push him further down.
13Alicorn_Prince_Shane: http://www.bronystate.net/rules/
That's the joke? .. kind of lame if you ask me
Dem rules
00,03Let's just hope you don't do anything ban-worthy and leave it at that, okay?
one vote for change the topic
i dont agree with rules of anysort but i still follow them
derpy_pony: Two votes
derpy_pony aye
StupidSexyCJ: That's what I thought aswell
derpy_pony: 3 votes
4 votes
aye
5 votes

this is not a democracy
00,03So... how about that Vinyl Scratch?
er, 6
lol
02I liek German voices |D
5 votes derpy_pony
lol Scooterview
Scooterview: how iz u?
10Ickk
NEW TOPIC: did you guys hear about the zombies man in miami?
derpy_pony: it should be a communist chat
What are you guys "voting" for?
flutter_spin, it's a bit clever. But you know how it is with jokes, if they don't work at once they fall flat when you have to explain them
Luna
Vinyl Scratch is a pretty cool pony. She plays music and doesn't afraid of anything.
morning
derp_derp: oh yea the homeless man thing
02leik
that was crazy
vinyl scratch is seventh best pony
I guess its like making a Spongebob reference to someone who has never seen Spongebob.
derp_derp, what did Arnold do now?
Shizuka: Claude is asking me if its perm ban
10Listening to Kyoko's German VA makes it worse
i did derp_derp isn't he the guy who toke some bad LSD and went crazy
there needs to be a communist chat
derp_derp: No, i did not.
13Yes.
aww
Shizuka: A perm ban? You banned him for such ealrier?
/me walks in, naked. notices it , blushes and teleports away. then back with a towel wrapped around him
he should have asked Shizuka or another mod
Just asking..
Magical_pab|Shower: lulz
Is everypony okay with her "cannon" eyes. I am but Im just getting everyone's opinion
Magical_pab|Shower: I saw you. ;)
02hmm
Alexxm they put 7 rounds in him, he was still standing
lol Magical_pab|Shower
Obsidian: Magenta is best eye color :)
GilDash: :P
Obsidian: I don't see why not.
Obsidian: you mean Vynil?
13Rape jokes aren't funny. End of story.
GilDash: STALKER!
Obsidian: red isnt a bad color :)
Yes
hey Magical_pab|Shower what have you been up to
Obsidian: i like them
02that's the voice Skylands wishes she had
00,03I'm glad I missed that.
CCCP: 23 minutes... close enough
Obsidian: I actually think they're better than red
Obsidian: I had no real preference before she had cannon eyes
I love Vinyl Stratch, when she makes the debut on the show, she was no one special, aside from her fans, then came the big change, in "The Canterlot Wedding", the show took the bronies by storms when they revealed Vinyl's eye colour, and no, they're not red.
Om: He walked into my LOS. That's not my fault. :D
Magical_pab|Shower: ha!
alexxm: nick talks on his own :D
Shizuka: Very well.. i think its a bit out of line, but very well, if its your decision
rounds -> bullet
13If Claude so desperately wants to come back and make more rape jokes, they can go through the appeal process.
02amirit?
10Nope
/me flees
GilDash: Oh. Oke den
Besides, in most cases a pony's magic relates to their eye color
poor claude i bet he didn't mean anything by it
sounds like someone didnt read the rules
i gona play battlefield 3 see ya!!
Sorry for my long message, but that's what I think of Vinyl...one of the best characters...
what Magical_pabs|Shower
vinyl isnt bad tbh
02what kind of voices do you like? XD
bye TheDamShadow01
[07:23:15] <Claudey> I understand that and I regret that and I would not do that again but that was too extreme
im going to nap
02on girls
VenHur96: Feel free to speak your mind
Shizuka: I for on support you completely. Not that you need my support but it is the spirit of the thing
She likes
/me shrugs
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: not gonna work! :P
alexxm: i have been up to....shower??? (capitain obvious mode activated)
hey Alicorn_Prince_Shane can you take that to pvt mssg?
Stereotype high pitched anime voices
.w.
VenHur96: are you new here?
10Nothing sqeuaky high, nothing incredibly deep/low
/me nomz off all his limbs
Ryunosuke: it is
02so just normal?
10Suuure
I meant, not in here ;0
;)
im copying something she said
10My voice is inbetween, but I still hate it
she?
Ryunosuke: logic please
02hurr
so who here has heard of a band called alestorm
GilDash: btw i hoped u saw me *sexy face*
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: she?
Ryunosuke: how can i talk with claude in mane chat if shes banned
02mine is inbetween-low
WindWhistler: Not really, been here for almost a month.
Oh. You have to read the book? No wonder. I couldn't even see the book. Well, at least I wasn't losing my mind now.
CCCP: yep
Alicorn_Prince_Shane, does he realize there is no use in telling you all these thing? He can write all that stuff in an official ban appeal
ah
Magical_pab|Shower: I said I did. :D
no season 3 till september
qq
ie. I dont think it is wise to post something that Shizuka said was over and done with in public clhat :)
*chat
RainbowAsh: he is she
mfw some one gets banned in chat, chat talks about it for next 2 hours
GilDash: and i was hoping u did :D
13That makes it even more disgraceful
how would you get banned from chat?
CCCP: yep
Alicorn_Prince_Shane, duely noted, that doesn't invalidate my point, though
this had been going on for two hours?
I won't be here for 2 hours. Just was super annoyed in not getting the joke. That comic tried way too hard to be funny.
GilDash: when i walked in, i mean:D
saying fluttershy sucks?
02Well, it depends. I have a easy time adjusting my pitch XD
hay shizuka best pony in the world
StupidSexyCJ: it wil be
:/
hence the pvt msg, (i meant a pvt convo with shizu)
Magical_pab|Shower: I've got eyes, haven't I? :D
GilDash: Not always
DrPug, no, that would just get some goons sent to your home address
While we wait for the 3rd season, we'll wait for MLP Online, let's face it, the bronies are crazy on the game, We're all going to play it because urimas, the creator of the game, deserves a pat to the back.
....
So how does everypony feel about the movies this week?
every time I see the word goons
GilDash: Your big head consumes them sometimes
hai mario_pony *nomz*
I think Goonswarm
did i, by any chance, miss something interesting?
No season 3 until september? Discord.
Dark_Horst: no
/me is nomed
not really
Om: Go play with some chocolate sauce Om.
VenHur96: Why wait for season 3? Let's make our own episodes! :D
That's ok. I already wrote 2 fanfics. That kept me busy while I wait for season 3
i saw the new karate kid just for jackie chan Obsidian
GilDash: I don't wana.
don't care for first one b movie is awesome
if some one wants to appeal but cant have a email due to personal reasons what do they do
DISCORD IS DELAYING SEASON 3

Alicorn_Prince_Shane, she could just get a webmail account. There are dozens of free services out there.
yeah thespitfirecolt but if you get jackie chan for a film you better have him get the best fight in the film
stream appears to be offline

08,01my first movie night here was the 16th of September 2011
03I was trying to make a hacked 4.11 firmware but apparently it doesn't have a key to decrypt it
alexxm: Tell me about it, it's so humid in New York
Rain: really? cool
08,01from looking at the film backlog
Hi alexx my day was great
My first movie night was...Last Thursday.
Hidden village of Rain is best village
lol naruto revish
08,01that was Blade Runner and My Little Pony: The Movie
my first movie night was in febuary
My first time here was on March 17th, 2012.
ah no wait, it was last Friday. oops
Yuck, I pouring rain here :(
08,01CCCP: well, it wasn't WMC'd, that's for sure
my first movie night was Babes in toy land
I've been here for a week. Wow.
When the episode "Dragon quest" premiered for the first time here on Bronystate.
Woodenfan it means college is uncomfortable as all hell if you have a full day Woodenfan
:[
alexxm: I'm going to college in the fall.
the dub it herts
my first time was the friday we watched revenge of the nerds
/me come to see the chat
If the greatest artists and animators on youtube got together we would have an MLP movie
Back in my days...
/me come to see the chat
Irish_Pony: ....holy hay.....:<
NO
first time here was on friday.. the same friday clue and coraline aired and SB played some rubbing rabbits that was an awesome friday :')
08,01so i probably was here between 2 and 3 months before i became staff
TheRainbowDash: the first episode i saw here was read it and weep
Fun fact: I hated all kinds of dubstep before I discovered Vinyl Scratch
TheRainbowDash: eeyup
Irish_Pony: Wow, that was....something....
Rikku379: That would be a great idea :)
08,01but that's because i'm a special pony with super awesome skills
TheRainbowDash: eeeeeeeeyyyyyyyuuuuuuuppppp

I'm sure it applies otakon
icybeauti: Are you leaving? You said bye in spanish
curse you buffer!

I'm pretty sure drunk Shizu would be amusing, myself, since normal Shizu is friendly and usually drinking just amplifies your normal behavior to silly levels.
Man, The Captain is SO badass
Ponies47: :D I'm not leaving. That's the name of a korn song. Look it up
O____O
Those eyes....

Ok....IM CALLING BULLSHIT
00,10catapults seem redundant in space.
^
icybeauti: I almost never sleep. Some nights I stay up until 5:00 AM and wake up at noon :P
SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE. YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
Or even LATER then 5:00 Am :P
WHAT WASW THAT?
btw Sumica .... Your cutie mark is an Ace???
Ace is the name of one of my book charecters ironically.
I must be pathetic, I just fell while sitting down in my own chair... fml... :'(
00,10it started off as a draftsmans compass but yeah
I remember an anime scene where a guy screams that if a girl doesn't do what he wants, he'll rape her
Sumica: So what does the Ace represent?
He should get a uniform it would make him much more attractive like that other fighter pilot
does he want her to be raped?
00,10it's cause I live in vegas =p
Makes sense
Sumica: So you gamble like a maniac?
Sumica Does it suck to live there?
00,10Or i guess Las Pegisis now
00,10no I dont gamble at all
pegasisisisisisisis
/me likes to believe that Sumica's cutie mark is actually a baked good of some kind, but he keeps it covered up with a fake cutie mark for reasons that are his own
I'm going to get some milk and cookies
Sumica: Do you get Bronycons near your area?
ill brb
00,10and realy it's like any other city other then you can get like any thing delivered at any time of day
OH GOD THOSE YAYS SUMICA THOSE YAYS
What are everypony's cutie marks?
Extreme crime rates, you think it would be a bag place to live in.
If I had an OC, I'd make it a Leaf. Combo of fluttershy and grovyle or something.
00,10crime is't that bad here
bag place?
I'm an owl.
Sumica: Why do you use so much yay? :D
I'm still a blank flank icybeauti
13yayayayayayayayyyyyy
00,10I dont.
Sumica: Yeah, stop making my heart melt
I'm a pegasus :P
owlicious: Who?
Sumica: too much yay
DerpStar: Just keep looking.
00,10you are the ones that keep saying my name
^
I'm off for cookies
13NOT ENOUGH YAY
^^
not a big deal
Sumica: Or do you? :O
00,10nope
00,10it's triggered when you say Sumica
I know
Sumica: LOL so when someone says your name, Fluttershy Yays xD
Sumica: lol who say your foot name?
Sumica: Okie doki loki :)
I say your name a lot
Guys, every time you say Sumica, he gets a ping. His ping happens to be yay

Was it shizuka or sumica that was a girl... i keep forgetting
00,10it has a cooldown so spaming it wont work
13yes
This manga kinda sucks...
00,10lol
I wish I could make an OC. Hmmmmmmmm. I needa learn how. Anyone know how?
Too busy looking at banners :P
owlicious: Shizuka
Hmm
lol
/me hands over muffins to everypony
Sumica: How does the foot ping work?
Death: This is anime, or is there a manga surrounding this?
13but we are both silly fillies~
Stormman3100: DUNNO
Shizuka: Not as silly as SuperBrony64 though :P
13well yeah
/me gives Shizuka a foot ping
Leader of the Bronies? SuperBrony64

03yuou have to create a new one
10:<
/me gives otakon a foot ping

Gmail is so inconsiderate -w-
10I don't want to have to deal with deleting original email on phone, cuz that requires resetting phone and all
DEM BANNERS
Gunthler, what the hell is a foot ping?
Lyra, get out of there!
10I'd have to re-root and redownload certain apps
/me gives Rain a foot ping

IMA FIRIN MA LAZAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
LE GASP!
03you got it rooted?
10Uh
10Whatever it's called when you put apps on the phone without paying for them in the market
Wow, they are REALLY outnumbereed
03unless you literally run your own mail service
03oh
10i.e. Android IRC
03that's just called installing apps LOL
03als why would you have to reset the phone? o_O
03just go into Accounts
thats serious man!
03delete one, add another, done
00,101 super captol ship vs a fleet, yeah they are outnumbered
10/facepalm
10Okay so
heyho!
Sumica: well, not only that but they're taking heavy casualties and they're are only so many humans on that ship
03for what it's worth, I made a new gmail just for my phone and I don't use it anywhere else.
Someone's mad.
03That way I don't get spam
look closely at his mouth
10Even if I add another account and remove the old one on my phone settings
/me foot pings
nvm
FIRE MA LAZA!!!!!!!!!
10All downloaded apps will disappear if I remove the old email account
Derpy_hooves: it's old anime, lip sync will be odd
her face was stretching o_o
/me gives Derpy_hooves a foot ping
So have you guys been streaming Anime all day? I was on when you played Spongebob earlier today lol
eh oh....

10I haven't even made a new account yet
Do you know me anyone

03only apps you got through the marketplace
10Still trying to come up with something short and sweet that isn't long
servers were down for Diablo 3 as well... but there back up now :)
03were any of those paid or were they free ones?
AND EVERYONE DIED! The End :$
RustyMeat: probably more then the casualties the Zentraedi would have caused.
10Free
00,10yes the ship is a giat transformer
Who knows me?
03well then, not really a big deal
10SMS popup, Angry Birds, Temple Run, etc
10Zedge
03there's a way to back up your data from the apps, but it requires root
lyncast me

I used to come here 9 weeks ago
Sumica: how long until they get the poitn force field defense system?

That ship is a gian robot ... a robot ins disguise!
10HML tried twice

Then basic training
03well'

Rain: well, they ARE in a giant space carrier
03it's a bash quote
00,10well the ship was't built with the plans of having a city inside it
Oh
Irish_Pony: Yeah, but I will soon. Basic Concept
God, that memory
lyncast: Why should I have you when I have the Angel of Death with me?
somepony should make a fallout equestria steelhooves' story....... the first chapter could be like this, "in every failure there is achivement, in every defeat there is victory, in darkness﻿ there is light, these are the things that make a great pony a pony, who will risk her life for you, a pony who will be willing to give her last bit of food to you this pony's name is....little pip. i am steel hooves, and this is my stor
