More cheery than anything, I'm not sure if there's even a genre for this type of music.
Annnnnd now everyone knows I secretly like Rarity xD
Thanks for the gaming music AdamTheDuck!
Derpy is not retarded :P
lol
AdamTheDuck: So what if you like RARITY? She's cool :3
Yeah but I used to hate her :D
AdamTheDuck: who? RD?
MadSurge, Rarityy
AdamTheDuck: same :D I love her drama queen moments
AdamTheDuck: I did to because I thought the "THE WROST POSSIBLE THING" was a running gag in the show. NOPE. Only for Lesson Zero. Which was my first episode of MLP FiM I ever watched :>
I know :D at first I couldn't stand her but I eventually liked her drama moments :3
RD became my least favorite instead :D
Rarity is bad
I'll still love Octavia more than anyone else XD
Dash is best
Bitch please, Spike is best pony

Can I share my story of victory with you comrades?

Thank you
alright listen up
haha
So I was just laying down on my futon and this damn roach thinks it can fly on me. So you know what I did? I smack that damn roach off of me and stood up. I saw it trying to crawl back to me. I guess it wanted to slam some more. So I beat the life out of it with a pillow and my bare hands. I proceeded to punch the roach at least 30 times before I left it there and continued watching my shows.
sorry for wall text
it is a great tale of victory
godspeed small roach friend

Sometimes though, running in can be to your advantage.
No one is there!
So who is streaming?
what for?
Running in is an advantage when you're playing the role of "human diversion"

Yeah we hear you please stop attacking our eardrums.
I got here a while ago ^
Jim: I must have missed ya. How, I don't know.
iwhat game is this?
Borderlands?
oh
Isn't a beta?
*isn't it a beta?
Enjoying the last few days before I'm going into military service
Starting monday :P
That by choice Jim?
Jim: You still will be able to visit here, won't you? Sure not often, but still?
im back for now
what I miss? o.o
We have compulsory conscription, so no, not by choice
but I am not really against it. it will be fun
I hope so.
are they gonna kill anything yet
what is this game? o.o
Planetside 2.
ahh..
Will probably be able to poke my head into here once in a while, when my recruit period is over
I did have plan buying it..
Jim, which country?
Kandarihu, Norway.
Jim: At least you're going in with a good attitude. I hope it goes well for you!
Jim, ah. I wish you well
Yeah, I've got three friends who are also going into the same battalion as me
Are they bronies?
Nope
Fair enough.
Hey guys can i ask a question
As long as it isn't about my super powers. . . Yes.
As long as it remains withing legal boundaries :)
iPhone why you hate me? :<
within*
Jim: ur joining the military?
who's the other guy?
Test
Sumica: Wrek it keeps kicking me from game
this shit
Look at all of those AFK players.
fuck this shit, i cant even play the fucking game
Never mind my question is gone in my mind
Bronysith, Yup
Well it was just test but iPhone hates me I'm out
Don't have Planetside 2 :<
i would love to. but i still got no response for my beta application
planetside doesntt want me in there
hey is that guy still looking for the voice acter this guys youtube channel name PwaaMLPfim?
one more time, but i am not going to be in the same vehicle as them cause it will glitch and kick me
the design of those turrets on that car roof looks very... lego
Lego is best turret.
Dark_Horst: How do you get the game, in the sense of, is it via Steam or some other means?
download from homepage, i'd guess
K
applied for beta there
Apply for beta, receive key, use key, receive access to client download.
Presumably.
the receive key is the problematic part
hai guise
I have the same feelings when I'm sniping, "stand still!"
who are we watching?

Dark_Horst, you get some nice perks for paying into it
Bethesda don't make many games, but bethesdap publishing publishes a lot of games

so from oct 1 52 epis/ 3 per day = a date[11:44:40 AM] I_Love_Pinkie_Pie/Lawrence/Insidious: plus a week
ok at 3 epis a day season 2 ends on oct 18th[11:48:37 AM] I_Love_Pinkie_Pie/Lawrence/Insidious: id put season 3 at oct 20 or 27
*My knack for redundancy surprises me, and not in a good way.
Ow My Eyes....
You make a compelling argument I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie-

i live MLP
00,10nah
I haven't seen wrek draw in a while-
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1348814813480.jpg
Vivix: He finished his Viking Pony two days ago, so who knows when he'll start drawing again.
Ooh the viking pony
my MLP youtube channel is darthcarnage3483
I'm gonna go check that out later
i have 11 vids thus far
Wrek Turns out I wasn't the only one getting payment error messages for Alpha. I just tried right now and it went through, too bad this laptop will not handle the game but still...
working on 8 more atm
anypony play friendship is magic epi 1?
it was epic
sorry welcome to ponyville epi 1
oh yeah i played it
it was feaking epic
I loved derpy
a bit dissapointed in how short it was- I was hoping for a CYOA like Choice of games
o.o
but it was scripted in lua, so since the engine is done, ep2 will probably not take six months
now i feel like playing welcome to ponyville epi 1 again
it is moddable too, just look up the images and lua files, really easy to amke your own adventure
the only complaint was some of the voices were not so good
it is fan made
the worst was the person performing scootaloo
I prefer no voices in CYOA, so you can have a name- but voices makes you inable to have a name
it just show that their short in VO
yeah-
they should also have a writer go through it and fix the grammar and such-
best voices were pinkie, rarity and AJ
almost the same as the show
bbbff on Hub <3
I played without voices after the tutorial
thats cool
still cant wait for act 2 ><
no disrespect to the VA's, but I just like it without voice in text games
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTabEPRSEeQ&feature=relmfu
I do wish it was more interactive though
go suggest to them then ask them for option to disable them
Vivix well it is their engine
m is the mute voices button
I_Love_Pinkie_Pie/Lawrence/Insidious is my skype name. If anypony would like to add me
yeah I like the engine, but in the lua you can add even more choices
and in text games i really like the option to choose whenever you have a decision that affects the mood
i wonder when fighting is magic will be playable in full version? meaning it is possible to play it MP
like talking to Trixie, you should have more than one choice direct the entire conversation
remember Vivix this is just act 1
of course of course
but that's how those kind of novelle games play, while I'm more fond of mud or CYOA like Choice of
OMG yinyl was soooo funny
basically one choice per paragraph almost, depending of course
hmm
well Im studying in Game Design and Animation...
breaks into your house and decides to crash with u in your bed
I mean that's just a diference in game type-- you know? But I personally would like a lot of choices-
i feel like making a pony game once im ready..
that would be neat-
a woona game xD
yea the choices were kinda limited
do you know Choicescript? If you like writing stories, it is a great way to attempt and basic--story telling in games
i heard
- the and
id like to get into making a pony RPG
there are attemp or still in develpment i heard
cool
I want a linear story game
as a player that is
like half life?
nnno-well, kinda but not violent
i just watched a pony gmod video... and there was an arabian ben 10 episode in the related bar
or well some violence maybe, depending on the story- but just something yeah linear but with a lot of character interaction and possibility of romance or friendship
ok this may have been discused before, but since im new. What is the 1 thing you would love to see happen in season 3?
sometimes i wonder about youtube
have you tried My Little Investagation?
Noo-
Dark_Horst: I know that feeling.
last I saw it was just a techdemo?
Id love to see if scootaloo has a family or if she doesnt see her become adopted
by FS
well its still under Demo
I dunno- that would change dynamic a lot-
Dark_Horst: I watched a PMV, and one of the videos was on how gender is assigned to a person :S.
Ahh, but yeah I saw and read about it, and it looked like a cool game
maybe save the scootaloo reveal for near the end of series
I would like more AJ info and lore background
she gets adopted and receives her cutie mark shortly therafter
but other than that- I just want ponies
yes more ponies
i want a plush of ponies...
though, I really want to se a deer, and see if they can talk or not
you belive rumor of john de lance returning
and put them on head as a thinking hat..

I Wish I Could Stream...
Theres So Much I Would Share...
Laurayne: not everyone can be mods unfortunately :D wait for the request channels to be opened
indeed
But...I suck HORRIBLY as Medic
and the job they have to preform
yay~ I Play Medic All The Time... Unfortunately Im No Good As Anything Else...
im ok with medic..
I'm alright I guess, I like healing people :D
as long I dont shoot at enemy
I play Medic, everyone dies :D
MadSurge: yea i have u on steam
More people get killed when I play medic X3
Demoman FTW!
Bronysith: when's your bday?
I Feel Overwhelmed When Everyone Spams The Medic Button Though... :(
MadSurge: december 6th
Laurayne: I know that feel soo well
Awww, ten days before my bro :3
Tiny AJ! :D :3
:)
http://imgur.com/AVV5n
I find as medic the best thing to do is ignore people asking for it and concentrate on finding the most injured.
^
thank you Meanwhile
Because bloody hell if people don't just enjoy pressing the button...
Meanwhile - that works to a degree
yeah
Meanwhile: luckily in the servers I've been on people who asked for it really needed health
I choose either the most injured or the one who needs it the most
besides, Meanwhile, what about the people who just fat-finger the W key?
I DOnt Know Who I Should Be Healing When That Happens And I End Up Dieing Before I Get Ubercharge :,(
Laurayne - in that case, heal the fattest thing around
Prioritise people in the line of fire.
Heavy Is A Good Choice For Ubercharge... Right?
More people alive means more guns means less enemy fire means progress.
if that heavy is right in the thick of things, yes
http://imgur.com/uDdzr
I heal those in need the most and STILL end up killing the poor person....
/me belongs in the Medic Hall of Shame
of all the times i've ever hit the E key, 10% of the time I needed a medic, the other 90% was me hitting while trying to move which is sad since my fingers ar skinny as hell or trying to hit the number keys for weapon switch :I
I forgot there was a medic key in TF2
how do you forget that?
I never use it
how do you forget it?
I never use it either.
:D Twitroll
thats Wrek s waifu
Well, considering I've played TF2 maybe 20 times since 2007 or whateveritwas, it's easy to forget keys you don't use
If that counts.
I'm just a klut with my fingers >.>
*klutz
I have yet to use the Gunslinger.....
Probably because my aim is shit
I--really have no idea what anything in TF2 is called
so Wrek whats ur fav metallica album again? black?
It is a fun game, but it's so rare that I play it
Vivix: I think Gunslinger is the one where you control the sentry yourself....lemme check
Ooh
ASoftFluffyThing - that's the Wrangler
Gunslinger gives you a mini-sentry i believe
I am shit at every multiplayer FPS but TF2 is fun to play regardless :D
oh taht you can 'sling' around?
I am pretty shit at most games, but I still have fun
05yeh
Aye Wrangler is the direct sentry control
MirrorImage: Ooh I knew it was one of those....
Gunslinger is the robot hand with the mini sentry.
I have yet to use either, to be honest
wrangler is meh in my personal opinion
http://imgur.com/CzEye
what is the best gaming headset for the purpose of recoeding gameplay
i'd rather do Gunslinger + Shotgun
on ps3
I'd try the Wrangler but knowing me, I'd MISS the enemy
if you want to record yourself talking you're best suited to get a comp'd voice mic
as for the Gunslinger itself, it's a GREAT distraction
like a proper XLR mic
ASoftFluffyThing - it has a bit of an aim-assist
so long as you keep the crosshairs near the enemy, it'll lock on
Hm
is turtle beach good?
Aaah. That will work perfect in MvM
brb grabbing deliciuos sandwiches
I think I'm gonna have to join bronystates server and play a bit sometimes
MvM was fun, but I only tried it once
and then battle axe
Vivix Word of warning, if you play Mann up mode, prepare to many round restarts.
Noot sure what that is- but okay, that's solo?
nice shades bro
Hi Wrek
Aaand PS2 is installed :3
My Computer Would Die If I Tried Running All That On It... :(
suddenly more Wrek
Recomended for all people wanting to get into youtube: Compressor, I'm sick of having to turn my volume up and down when people scream on lets plays-
Isn't Mann Up pay to play?
CountDoofus - "Mann Up" is really more of a difficulty setting
/me does not know
but yes
Mann vs Machine itself is free to play, but if you want to play the Mann Up difficulty, it's 99 cents for a ticket that doesn't get expended unless you win
aah-
then I dunno-
In other words, more money for Gabe's money fort.
I payed for TF2 way back when, haven't played it enouh to justify the money
http://www.vgcats.com/comics/?strip_id=300 *cough*
hehehe
they deserve my moneys!
Well--for games, not so much for..hats
That last panel in that comic.
So sexy
I need to go purge my eyes with cleaning agent.
hehe
Unboxing TF2 crates isn't always bad. My medic now wears a purple confetti-spewing geisha hair thingamabob.

Anyway, back to fic writing.
MirrorImage: same XD

CountDoofus I laughed so hard at the last panel
Good Music~ :)
BladedWings: Planetside 2
Laurayne: agreed ^_^
ASoftFluffyThing: ah cool
Later VGCats comics have a few MLP references in them. :3
CountDoofus did you know the writer is a brony?
That kind of explains the MLP references :D
http://www.vgcats.com/comics/?strip_id=311 Derpy in last panel!

Oh, Wrek's streaming again.
My Computer Is Lagging The Stream So Bad Its Makeing My Brain Hurt :'(
CountDoofus, btw there is a MLP reference here too http://www.vgcats.com/comics/?strip_id=306
Yup. A fairly obvious one :)
CountDoofus, and I think he blogged it somewhere, I'm trying to find it XD
lol Nice Referense :)
hi
He even made a MLP specific comic, but deleted it from his site. Guess it caused quite a stir in the fandom, since it involved the CMC meeting an untimely end.
new nick?
( xX1337Caydz0rzXx)
yeah :p
CountDoofus yeah... pretty much flame from both sides.
lol
whats up
I'd link it right now, but don't think I'll be making any friends by doing so :p
everything is fine
CountDoofus thats what PM is for~
Ah, wanna see it then?
Sorry But I Have To Pause The Stream... My PC Is Haveing A Fit...
God damn it, why is programming so hard!
CountDoofus, yeah. I dont believe I've seen it
at the moment, I am tryint to do point in triangle checking
/me flips a table
/me flips RaveBrony.
of course it is not working :p
Lol :D
but I will figure it out soon
triangle checking?
whats that
How could anyone NOT like Sweetie Belle? My heart skips a dozen beats with every voice crack she makes.
Okay... Now I Have To Read Them All... Be Back In A Bit After Reading All VGCats
Laurayne: thats what i'm doin lol
Laurayne, ive been following him for years :) he is quite awesome
lol
point in triangle checking is algorythm, that check if some point [x,y] is inside triangle[x,y][x,y][x,y]
Imagine if you could run an entire raid via song.
That "picking up quests in Mass Effect 3" comic was both hilarious and creepy.
/me flips Meanwhile
I need it for sphere x triangle checking
CountDoofus hehe but he does have a point
Also fan of the VG Adaptation With No Name.
CountDoofus, I laughed at the comic strip about Shepard being a slut.
ah
"So help me God if I catch anyone else driving 10-fucking-kilometers an hour, I'm gonna drag them out of their car and beat them with oranges!"
Lemons.
/me flips himself.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt6iTwVIiMM
SORRY!
Forgot about the link thing.
Crap.
ASoftFluffyThing he is best slut
Panda: He is' isn't he.
The CAD comics also have a good point concerning Mass Effect. http://www.cad-comic.com/cad/20071119
Panda: Let's hope he doesn't have any diseases
ASoftFluffyThing: havent got to that one yet
If you're going to beat someone with lemons, you need to use combustible lemons.
BladedWings, you'll be fine
ASoftFluffyThing, hm... I would hope that when having sexual relations with any... thing.... he would put on a jimmy capy XD
lol
EspyLacopa: Yep.
Panda: true
Teamkiller!
Panda: I hope so too, even though it's not shown........*shudders* I hate to think what hell he would go through if he ever got an alien STD
ASoftFluffyThing well... then he ded XD I mean... >.> not sure why you would screw something like that.
Panda: Not sure either.
Here's a question. If you could choose to be any race to be in the Mass Effect universe, which race would you be? I'd totally be turian.
Meh, when you want it from somewhere you get it from somewhere ASoftFluffyThing XD
05id be the oen that lives logn and fucks alot
CountDoofus, that a hard que- OMG Wrek XD
Panda: I think I'd rather do that to myself than with an alien.....
ASoftFluffyThing OH! I get it. He was DRUNK!
Panda: OH GOD!
Hmm... Turian or Quarian. Tali is freaking adorable.
Asaaarrrrriiiiiiii.
CountDoofus, lol first comic http://www.vgcats.com/othercomics/?strip_id=0

Disagreed, Red is best color
Panda: :D

Who doesn't like numbers?
LadyCanary: Eeyup.
Who's wrek playing with? Whoever it is sounds like Tony Stark.
donutpop365: Sumica.
donutpop365: ...Cannot unhear.
Ship looks like a Blue Angel
Does that mean Wrek is Thor?
^
GOD
...of Thunder.
Makes sense since he wears Thor's hammer.
Wrek is now the new Thor.
Well he DID make a viking pony.
And he IS Scandinavian.
Sumica, you sound like Tony Stark.
http://www.waltdestler.com/shipbuilder.html this might become as awesome as dwarf fortress
That's a compliment by the way.
he doesnt look as i would have imationed thor would look like.....
Hello LadyCanary! How are you, my fine lass?
...Wrek is making me blush >///////////<
The avengers needed to be about 20% cooler
donutpop365: You're right, actually.
dose glasses
MadSurge: Well, eating a pumpkin muffin.
Also, those are some nice shades.

Huh. I thought that was Robert Downey Jr.

Who the heck is Chace Crawford?
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Instrumental Music: The Long Road Home / The Hydra / Forever Asleep
twilight_sprinkle: Ahaha yep.
He's an actor from the girly show Gossip Girl, Kammerjunk.

Oh.

Ohai.
AJIsAwesome: I was thinking RD would be Iron Man, either that or Twilight 'Cause she's sciency, then AJ for Captain, though the eyepatch totally fits because MLP.
AJIsAwesome: I think AJ and RD should switch in that picture.
Hm.
ponified avengers?
I think there's a Pony-vengers pic somewhere.
You know if you guys fly over the fight the turret can take pots shots.
donutpop365: Agreed.

Sumica is the other voice.
O_o
Hey all.
http://fav.me/d50sji5
hi Randomnerd
Haio Randomnerd
Question: If the area of a triangle can be found by 3*sin(theta), would it be possible to find the angle with only the area?
Ah, I recognize the other voice now
Spectrum_Rush: thats why I said "one of the most upvoted"
Kammerjunk yes
Well, balls.
dat air guitar
<3
Kammerjunk: you cant find an area through one angle
I am so confused now.
LadyCanary: \:3/
:D HIYA SuperBrony64 <3
I can see a Canary of female birth, and a Sprinkle that isnt a sparkly vampire.

SB tends to be naked often, lol.
ohai SuperBrony64
Ohai SuperBrony64
twilight_sprinkle: We'll say, as an example, that the angle is 45. 3*sin(45) = 2,121
'Lo.

Hi, Serenity :)
hi Serenity
noon*
Hell nah, ASoftFluffyThing XD youuuuuuu
Kammerjunk: first of all, area is supposed to be meters, a trig function is unitless. secondly, its supposed to be to the second power, that formula is first powe
Serenity: Mostly for funsies.
Meanwhile, wasnt being funny... but ok ^^
LadyCanary, no youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu :3
*power
hello Everybody :)
god, iris sucks. let me refresh, one sec
AJIsAwesome: Okay. We'll have enough fun it spreads across the world and everyone gets some fun :D
ok back
LadyCanary and ASoftFluffyThing : ladies ladies, you are both awesome ^_^
Randomnerd: Make sure to take some pictures. :)
Sure thing!
hi Lil_B
ASoftFluffyThing: You is lady?! :O
Grena-boom.
Kammerjunk: also, imagine you had an angle between to sides. despite having an angle, the two sides can be of any length, hence there is no way you can derive a triangle area from one angle
AJIsAwesome *gasp*
thanks BladedWings|Laptop :)
LadyCanary: i assumed?
XD
Panda|BL2: *GASP* :O
LadyCanary, YES i AM
That ASoftFluffyThing is a SPAI!

heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeey sexy lady!
btw AJIsAwesome , i need to pay more attention to my schedule, apparently my exam is next week :\
I was just going to say this. there is no way to determine a triangle's area with one trig equation
It's gonna be a good weekend.
I thought Sumica was a lady at first too, BladedWings|Laptop XD
What do you mean? Sumica is a lady.
LadyCanary: i just go by name until told otherwise
And he's a very pretty one too.
what Meanwhile said :3
^
hahahaha
LadyCanary, BladedWings|Laptop I thought the same thing. Lol these names
twilight_sprinkle: Same here. I have a chemistry test coming up.
Sumica is dickshep, Dickjensen and dicknico
Sumica has a rule 63 poneh
That's who he is
ASoftFluffyThing: true
Alchemist: there are trig equations for areas if you have two angles though
Randomnerd: And it is quite sexy.
Okay, who's in the inset stream?
AJIsAwesome: yeah but i though the exam is today :D
Sumica has a pony of ALL THE RULES
twilight_sprinkle: You did? :D
twilight_sprinkle: thats reasonable, but there is no way you can do anything with one angle.
Guy in sunglasses! Who are you???
Randomnerd Wrek
lol
Thank you, Panda|BL2
AJIsAwesome: yeah, i was preparing until i had to run off to the class, because i didnt understand one thing, but it turned out its next week..

Panda|BL2: It demands hugs.
brodashX_ why cant you
Meanwhile, meh, I'll take a hug. Its not that big

Everyone, I believe that it's time we take Meanwhile off his Internets. Yay or nay?
To preserve our sanities from bugs and weird fishes
brodashX_, swim!
ASoftFluffyThing: hmmmm....yay
That's pretty nifty, brodashX_
ASoftFluffyThing nay
XD
twilight_sprinkle: Pardon, I've been ballsing the entire section up. My given text -does- say "T = 3*sin(theta)", but it simply refers to the hypotenuse, which it at 3 (units). Is it still invalid?
Hey, Canary, you got a moment?
Kammerjunk: do you have theta?
twilight_sprinkle: Yes.
is there a way to get winter wrap up out of your head
Kammerjunk, twilight_sprinkle... You've lost me
is it a right angled triangle then?
Kammerjunk: then yes, you can find the area
Fine, Meanwhile keeps his Internet and continues supplying chat with nightmare fuel. >.>
brodashX: Hah, no.
ASoftFluffyThing: damn
brodashX: replace it with love is in bloom.
Panda|BL2: geometry! :3

Kammerjunk: np
Welp.

http://i.imgur.com/1XMP6.png
Panda|BL2: i hated my high school geometry. i was in advanced math class and my teacher was MLG and all out problems were MLG. it involved too much theory memorization so i sucked at it..
Meanwhile: that one is not as bad
Kammerjunk: oh, I just thought it was because you mentioned its hypotenuse.
Meanwhile: That's weirdly pretty. Needs more glowy jellyfishies
^
twilight_sprinkle, geometry theorums were hard for me but I have no problem with psych ones XD
Panda|BL2: my memory sucks so im bad at memorizing things that dont involve logic :P

A cockatrice?
while I agree that another draq(qord i cant spell) would be awsome I mean a changeling that moved to ponyville or the everyfree forest, but in terms another dragon or draq-athingy i agree, that would be awsome
LadyCanary: I was about to bring that point up, actually :3

They eat worker termites on the outside of a nest and then hang the corpse above an entrance as bait for others, then they repeat until they have enough to make a suit with the corpse parts and use it like camo.

Where are you getting all these pictures?
internet.
lolok
AJIsAwesome: TLDR I had a dream where I was camping with two of my friends and had a fever and had to stick a centipede up my nose to keep the fever at bay
Meanwhile: okay. That takes the cake. :d
Coconut crabs!
RAWRity, the hell
ASoftFluffyThing: Oh, my.

Meanwhile: good thing they're fundamentally innocuous
how does that even work

I'm loving these pictures. :D
with out them humping your brain
AJIsAwesome: apparently dreams about centipedes mean that you're letting your fear hinder you from getting something done or achieveing a goal
RAWRity: DAT ONE GUY ON THE LEFT
Meanwhile: Lobster tastes good
I haven't had a good dream in years. :D
actually, this one fits the best. Meanwhile would be the guy in this picture: http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_maols4871L1qcinbmo4_1280.jpg
In this case your letting centipedes into your body because of fever.
I usually have bad dreams when Im stressed.
RAWRity: Pfft.
Meanwhile: crustaceans you say :s http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_marnyd50E01rtj99z.gif

Those girls.
RAWRity: SO what are they reacting to?
Look at the one in the air.
XD
but many times when I am having a bad dream I wake up to realize Im in a weird posture and about to swallow my pillow.
AJIsAwesome: these are pictures from a haunted house. They have a surprise scare at the very end of a maze, and take people's pictures as they scare them.
Ok.
RAWRity: that is hilarious
I think their reacting to the size of justin beibers dick.
RAWRity, nah Meanwhile would be the only one in the pic that would still have a bored expression

Stallion_of_War: worked for the joker :D
Serenity: Probably thE R63 OC.
*the
Presuming Wreky drew it?
Yep
<3
There's your answer
Is it just me, or would anypony else just immediatly start snogging a R63 version of themselves?
snogging?
Snogging?
Nope, I would just to back to back warzone with myself
ohai poner pepple
Hi, IshPonyPony :)
hi IshPonyPony
Double the Serenity, and every country would be fucked.
:D
I'm using that word correctly right? Snogging = making out.
snogging means kissing
/me has a new gaming channel on youtube
Stallion_of_War: Oh. Well then no.
Of course I'm using it right. David Tennant said it.
Stallion_of_War: *AJ voice* Nah

/me giggles.
I don't think I want that game.
Serenity and...Serenity shooting their enemies, eff you see kay eye en gee
Wait, wut
I'd want that game so I can do that cool thing that happens when you microwave a cd.
I can imagine that nothing happens when you microwave a CD
Serenity I see what you did there
well i gotta get ready for class so see yall later tonight, hopefully XD
"Is it a good idea to microwave this" on YouTube
They should be able to tell you
^
Might fuckity fuck the files, but physically shouldn't affect it, snce CD's have no water
The masks, they do nothing
Oh, AJIsAwesome, thanks for the dA watch :)
Most things either melt, explode, or catch fire
Too bad they don't make new episodes anymore. :(
CountDoofus: No problem. :)
If something has water, even a trace in it, it will be affected by microwaves
If not, then nothing happens
CountDoofus: I was wondering who made that "At The Gala" comic strip. :D
And notice the "in" not the on
See, they made an episode where they microwaved themselves, but since it was a bad idea and they died, they didn't upload it
because they were dead
and not Shaun of the Dead style zombies
LOL, see the conspiracy
AJIsAwesome: I wouldn't know. <_< >_>

You remember that episode where Timmy wished that whatever costumes a person wore gave them that costumes powers? We need a world like that, but instead, everyone is ponies.
Someone get on that.
Bronysith: Oh you
Bronysith: :D
I love how Mariopony is just saying "I has a cutie maerk"
Me too. :D
Bronysith wut?
Does he still come here?
I haven't seen him.
who?
Stallion_of_War: Like costume quest?
And I'm here a lot.
Mario_Pony
Maybe?
Wrekwoaoah.gif
He's a pony who came around here a lot like half a year ago
Step 1: Avatar, but not with alien smurf-cats, step 2: Cybermen, step 3: Data, step 4: The Doctor on Voyager - http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/17ur7674mnjd9jpg/original.jpg
Why is Applejack a raccoon?
guys ill go and be back in a hour k? :)
*shrugs shoulders*
Although step 3 could also be repurposed so WE CAN ALL BE ROBOT PONIES!
Serenity: beats me, maybe because they wash apples? :D
Actually, all 4 stages could be repurposed so we could be ponies.
:)
Or...we could not.
GET ON THIS SCIENCE
I'm a warlord pony :3
To be honest, I'm fine just being a human.
^
Stallion_of_War is that shit for real?
I kinda like my opposable thumbs :D
i like being human
All things considered I'd settle for having my brain uploaded to the robot.
I think it's supposed to be - http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2048299,00.html
I doubt it'd work though
Honestly, I don't want to live forever.
It would seem boring to me.
If we reached a point where peoples minds could just be stored on hard drives we'd be like a more complex version of the Geth.
Eventually they could construct a robot that would reconstitute itself when it gets damaged enough; perhaps 13 times?
I want to at least live to see the destruction of humanity
AJIsAwesome: what about deciding when you will die?
it would... regenerate, or something...
Wrek: fuck this shit, until they fix this crashing problem i aint playing
Bronysith: I think that's what happens when your spaceship is shot down.
:3
Thanks for having me in your squad wrek :)
MadSurge: I don't know. Death happens when it happends. I can't be sure.
I would be thrilled to be Avatar B

Sergio_Scriptor: Well that's true, just about everyone is a pillock.
i wish i had half hour classes again
Meanwhile: exactly :D
Ok guys, going to bed now. Goodnight, see you tomorrow!

The invite all neighbors thing is a cheat, type in the cheat, shift+click the mailbox and select invite all neighbors
Shining_Star: Then I started to draw, and I feel it is getting better. I just wish I could do it more.
RAWRity: it's so true :D
it is
RAWRity: is this not common knowledge?
its easy to get away with being a brony when you`re in the football team
its also incredibly easy to procrastinate
hello fellow regulars
Bunny_Striker: that seems strange
Like, I remember the first thing I wrote. It was a Harry Potter fanfic and it was awful.
Hey Bronysith
Everlasting_Joy Well i wish i could have the determination like you i just cant draw after 5 minutes

01,11I'm sorry, but I don't see the issue with Bale's Batman voice. I mean, it does get over the top, but it's not nearly as god-aweful as people make it out to be.
pulled a batman
he noclipped out
so thats what that feels like
how does he do that
I disappear faster when I fart

Silverscreen, just the over-the-top is too much for me
05,15It really isn't that bad. How else is he going to disguise his voice?
if one sign doesn't work, put up another one

BEST. BUTLER. EVER.

how did we get from campy 60's TV show to this?

RIP Batman. Taken too early by severe throat cancer

Ahrlfehd. Whai ahr you heeeeer?

Oh great. Now I have this mental image of Batman calling Gordon up in the middle of the night and Gordon is all like... "... So what are you wearing?"

And then he speaks all natural and he's like "Oh, hey, he sounds pretty awesome!"
a BIG dog
Like Clifford big
I loved the chemistry between Batman and Catwoman in TDKR

Micheal Cine the best Alfred
Was he big and red?
i loved TDKR
00,10I threw a rock at em
and TDK
00,10it was a big rock
One thing I do like about this movie compared to the '89 version is this one feels a little more life-life. The '89 version is very romantic and dark for no good reason..
changelings where? :o
and the animated series
Sumica: was it a ...DAMMIT
05,15I liked Bane. I found him super intimidating
01,11That said, I also liked Bane's voice, and was able to understand him perfectly.
That Batman voice, although effective, has to be a strain on his throat.
Batman vs Clifford
And then he tries being all badass as Batman and he just sounds hilarious.
Joker>Bane.
I`m wearing women`s pants... yeah, I`m that sexy
Character. CHARACTER
hes batman
yay
Silverscreen: you're lucky I couldn't understand him at times
01,11Sumica /)
Copycats? Don't they live in the Kirby Universe?
05,15Bane's voice was kickass
Shirtless.
ouch
i would rather face bane TBH
Silverscreen: just sayin, that's probably the problem ppl have with it. Everywhere else, it's fine.
<3
except hockey pads
BatBunny_Striker: but aren't you a guy?
batman is a douchebag
00,10Silverscreen (\
08,01i think they should replace all the music in this film with th emusic from Batman: The Animated Series
he does. in the next movie
stop YAYING
hes batman
I think a uncharacteristically heroic changeling should become the next Mare-Do-Well. :D
I liked bane's voice too, though I missed what he was saying half the time
Joker was a more intriguing villain, but Bane was both a physical and psychological threat to Batman
Silverscreen: Thye dubed Bane's voice so people could understand it
cause the joker will make you fear him before death
yay
yays, yays everywhere
Bane's voice was hard to understand at the beginning but you got used to it. Too bad they goofed him up in the end.
bane just beats the shit out of you
Pale_Horse: could happen
05,15Bane can snap you in half AND make crazy villain plots. Joker is weak and only can use others to fight
..
6_9
....
harvy!
Arron Eckhart
they should replace all music in this film with MLP music
needs more yay
DERPDERPDERPDERP: I hated how they fucked him up in the end :S
otakon: yes, and like I said "I`m dat sexy"
:P
I think they should have done a James Earl Jones and overdubbed Bale's voice with another actor's or something.
I love Bane !
I never understood why they switched Rachel's actor from the first film.
Chrysalis: hmmmm
dat foreshadowing
Fluttercry: but the joker is still completely insane
Am in the only one who didn't like Bane's voice at the beginning?
FORESHADOWING
Lucky coin
oh shit
I couldn't understand Bane at all. Which was a shame since he dropped a ton of one-liners
so do i
Chrysalis: your right :D
he has a coin
RDash5000: OH SO MUCH
Elmo is best villian.
Gee I wonder who that guy is
DERPDERP: messed up bane in the end?
I liked Bane From the start :)
i liek his coin
2-face?
yoshi is best evil guy
MaxTheBrony: Yup, up to that point I would've considered him the best of the Batman film villains.
is he 2-face?
forshadowing
01,11I was a little blindsided by the gentleman accent, but after the first scene, I realized it fit the character perfectly. A respectable psychopath.
he was a much better 2face then tommy lee suckass was

^^^
xD
Silverscreen: hmmm debatable but he IS good
Silverscreen: funnyjunk never shows the pic
Silverscreen best live action Joker. Mark Hamill is till animated joker
i like feet...
no ceaser romero was best joker
i just realized, he's channeling a teen tiny bit of goldblum in this performance
Nobody will ever be able to play the Joker again without comparing the performance to Ledger's...
otakon: i like hamills joker better
The Brokeback Guy is The Joker? This movie is now ruined! ~2008
Fuck. Skipping all over again.
Spectrum_Rush: yeah i know :s I never get to see the picture from funnyjunk
MaadBunny: no joke you almost killed theking o.o
Fluttercry: or the time CIS New York tried to "trace his IP by making a GUI interface with Visual Basic"
05,15What about Mark Hamil Joker?
The Televisions plan, lol
feet are awesome
05,15yup
Uh, not the Joker debate again

he did only voice
MrBen im with ya
And we have a meme

We kill the Batman
feet tastes soooo good..
Thats the words of wisdom
Anyone else doing the Joker;s lines along with thim? :)

Eeyup.
dat pun
Is it skipping like mad with constant buffering every 10 seconds for anybody else!?
Fluttercry: i like hamils joker better than ledger
They've got every race imaginable around that table.
Hamill is very good too. But he's typically best for the amimated appearances of Joker, in my opinion
puns
/me puts on batman mask(FINALLY!!)
brb again
spiritwaffle theking told me i could eat his feet..
Cypresswolf: I did naaaght. Ohai Mark
http://trolledbot.net/pix/4751.jpg

You can;t tell if the Joker is mad in this version he needs alot of intelligence and a level head for what he does.
01,11What would happen if all jokers got together?
"You think you can steal from us and just walk away!?" "Yeah"
here's my card xD
Michael Jai White wants to fuck you up!

Cypresswolf: I did naht burned her, i did NAHT! O hai Harvey!
but this joker is just insane
Silverscreen: Something....scary and wondorous?
Silverscreen: the horror...THE HORROR!
basically, despite a decade having passed, most shows still think "Hackers" is an accurate depiction of technology.
Silverscreen: DESTORY US ALL!!!
Hey your number not on it

I dont know what Joker does on his freetime D:
lol, going to the joker to take things more seriously

They're hacking the gas lines and the cars and the boats and everything else.
Now he's an Irish cop?
xD
MaadBunny: i mean a spoon... realy
Both sounds reasonable
he could have done both
There's always a cop called Mahoney and Ramirez
at the same time
So Batman goes to China...
It May Sound Bad, But I Must Say, I Kinda Like The Joker... He May Be Psycho And A Villan, But Hes Really Impressive Smart...
Silverscreen: that is SO wrong
STEALTH HI BYE, while being looked at
05,15Ramirez, stop the Joker with this throwing knife

This was actually pretty grim when in TDKR, Bane and his crew took Bat-Man's armory.
After this movie is done, can we watch the "How It Should Have Ended..." for it? :D

MaadBunny: indeed. i mean... dat ass
Cat... Catwoman

Meanwhile: the girl loves batman
Lunac I mean how did Gordon and the DA expect Batman to get to China
Interesting factoid: Skyhook is actually the name of an advanced parachute release system, that automatically activates the reserve parachute when the main is cut away.
*hint hint*
Rottweilers
Bronysith which series is that?
Yeaaah
I see what you did ther, Morgan
Fox. I've never read a set of instructions in my entire life and I'm too old to start now... :|

Batman, how did you get here?
let's say that some people hate for no reason...
13cops get batman, bad guys get joker
batman gets robin, joker gets harley
shut the fuck up this is BATMAN, woman!
13hey um batman, i think your phlegm just contaminated the scene fine
AlienWarhead, the neutral evil are the worst of all.
twilight_sprinkle Well it makes the cape go in a cone uppwards and thus not getting so much friction in the air , so the velocity of the both body masses should be equal to Pinkie
You don't blame Batman for everything!
hopefully Batman won't teleport mid drilling
hey its that one dude from lost
dem hallowpoints
yeah this bit
MaxTheBrony: what i meant is that his cave might have a way to form a shape to slow down, he glides on it afterall
01,11I find it funny that a lot of people complained about Batman NOT doing detective work, yet whenever he DOES do detective work, all people do is bitch about how wrong and innacurate it is.
makes no sense to me
OK, that's scene just buggers me
more louder!
aimbot
Thats cute
twilight_sprinkle :p allright allright i give up ^^
Here at Apature Science we use the whole bullet, that's 65% more bullet per bullet
13too much to ask for both?
Hai Morgan Freeman.
That drill thing made me think of the dentist.
MaxTheBrony: :)
Is there ANYTHING possible in it?
13this weasel does better detective work than batman :3
We want our cake, and we want to eat it too.
Thulu-tan: dude as a gunsmith what is your take on that gun firing scene?
badass morgan freeman moment in 3
Silverscreen, how is it wrong and innacurate?
What was this guys name
?
Sounds like people want to see Batman do REALISTIC detective work.
Pinkie Pie style!
SirGanjalf: Jumping out a window and falling 20 feet and... oh wait...
What scene?
that...
Oh this scene
morgan freeman?
Wait, Batman is doing that.
Laughed so hard
BRB BATHROOOOM D;
http://derpy.me/PtKjq want
Thulu-tan: the one where he's firing the bullets
You want ot black mail batman?
Nope.
a floating ship for the third movie, actually
batwing foreshadowing
HA!
i know who it is
If I discovered Batman's identity, I wouldn't wanna blackmail him. i'd wanna fight crime with him. :D
I love this line
he played god
10 MILLION MONIES
Dat blackmail
twice
nobody challenges God
13aaaand the smile sloooowly fades
dont remember it, didnt see it happen here.
lol
"You really think your client, the WEALTHIEST MAN in the WORLD, spends his time beating up vigilantes? And your plan is to BLACKMAIL this man? ...Good luck."
Nah, the rocket is for the 3rd film.
YOu cant blackmail morgan freeman
:D
lol
Listen to Morgan Freeman, stupid man.
*trollface*
Freeman +9000 intelligence
Nice thinking,.
lololololololololo
genius plan!
Well, when you put it that way, it sounds ridiculous
:D
Pale_Horse: seen the latest movie :)?
HA!
I want a PB&J sandwich next week. Looks like my wish will come true. GL with 10 mil
you know who are you messing?
I love it
eenope

thats nuts
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: i friggin love phoenix wright
I've made a terrible mistake
lol
BURN!
Good Luck!
01,11CrimsonPhoenix: I don't know, but there's aparently big rants on how him figuring out the source and fingerprint on the bullet wouldn't really work.
00,10how dumb are you to blackmail a black male in person
I love that line
God gives you his blessings. Because you'll need it.
xD
dat burn
I would join forces with Batman and become NightWing because Nightwing is awesome.
Bitch, don't you ever mess with Morgan Freeman.
Yeah when you put it like that you realise the stupidity of that idea.
Gen says I'm being mean to her because I don't want to go to her house today and that we were planning it all week when we just decided on it yesterday :P
Sumica: dohoho
13Silverscreen: fingerprint wouldn't survive impact
i don't see the connection
I could become... I dunno.... "THe Fruitbat!" :S
Damn it. I need to take care of something. I'll be back.
IT'S A FINGERPRINNNTTTTT.
LOL
i thought he weared gloves
13ZOOM IN
13ENHANCE
CSI tactics
:p
Sith just likes to yell out that he likes things at random.
01,11See, after that scene, I thought he was going to become The Riddler.
screw CSI
Feel free to ignore him.
this is batman
CSI: Gotham
haha
^^
And I didn't get a chance to explain why I didn't wanna go anymore before she hung up on me
no
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: sorta looked like miles edgeworths outfit
SirGanjalf: YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
Shizuka: Yes it works everytime.
Silverscreen: I can see that happening
I WANT A FOURTH MOVIE WITH RIDDLER
I knows, sad that the Nolan series didn't include Riddler in the series.
not even close
Silverscreen who?
whats the b movie?
what's B movie?
New York Gotham > Chicago Gotham
never say never
Indie-ception.
I thought Nolan said he was done with Batman movies.
come to think of it, I would've enjoyed a Riddler more than Bane, but then that might've been too much work coming up with clever riddles and makign the entire movie a puzzle...
13don't actually care alfred!
01,11Mister Reese. Good with numbers, good with money, and knows Batman's identity. How did he just vanish into the background after this movie?
Fox?
bat bike
13busy looking cool!
Myvlen White google it
OohShiny: Some movie about guys watching a movie about making a movie.
CrimsonPhoenix i think theres some easter egg that the guy blackmailing batman is the Riddler
Oh yeah
Theres some proof out there
RosePetal: He is done. But the producers...
That does make sense.
back
Silverscreen: if I told ya why it'd be a spoiler
whats the real b movie?
is fox there casting? :)
MaxTheBrony, still I want THE villain riddler
inb4 surprising scene #2.
true
Man, the Bat-cycle really got a downgrade didn't it?
That's pretty much what it is.
pokémon black and white
I remember hearing that rumor about Eddie Murphy playing Riddler in the third film.
Its sad that theres no more nollan batmans thio
It's an indie film about filming indie films;
Where do you hid from hundreds of cops? Amongst them. only logical
tho D:
the movie
So many cops.
AJIsAwesome: is it sudden?:S
It sounds skull meltingly dull.
I want life risking riddles and batman managing to figure them out
B-movie, "Living in Oblivion".
13there's a lot of windows up here.. SO WHY DO YOU MAKE THE PARADE FOLLOW THE ROUTE
twilight_sprinkle: JUst watch.
ever heard of president John?
you gonna die mayor
13honestly gotham police deserve everything joker does to them
CrimsonPhoenix so it would be like SAW but with batman?
HOSTAGES.
O.o
eeeeee sound again
Shizuka: bc it's New York
ahh oblvion, how i miss you
Also
Wher does he keep his Batman gear if he doesn't have a bag for them?
01,11The best one I heard was Johnny Depp or David Tennant being the Riddler. That would have been awesome.
ooo sexy
13chicago
Here we go.................
this was filmed in Chicago right?
Good but frankly
everything is filmed in chicago
:)
IT'S A TRAP!
Tennant as the Riddler, now that would be something
Silverscreen: tennant as riddler? FUND THE CRAP OUT OF IT
And something else from the sounds of it
yeah
ew.
He took Old Man Jenkins!
It's fun hearing the Batman voice from Wayne
13he forgot his thinking mask
> Tennant
> Riddler
the music
Love joker with out Make up
:)
Silverscreen, ALL OF MY MONEY
ding
joker no makeup
Look at tahe mouths
Good thing, my body isn't ready for that.
FIRE
DUN
01,11Yes, The Dark Knight was filmed in Chicago, while Dark Knight Rises was filmed in Pittsburgh
THAT WAS THE JOKER WITHOUT HIS MAKEUP!
fast thinking
man, look at that scramble
nice makeup job
Gordon, noooooo
RosePetal: Yes it was
I dont think downtown in any city is a good place for shooting off rifles
RosePetal: i think he had additional makeip
RosePetal: holy crap you are right
13he's dead jim
not gordon!

00,10man down

Shizuka: :D
00,10now teabag the corpse
scar cop just blends right in
RosePetal don;t worry
relax, he'll be fine
isn't that scarecrow?
twilight_sprinkle: no the this Joker didn't get his skin bleached he only has the scars
not gordon
Why must they always be dead, me?!
gary oldman no!
I can't die! I'm Gary Oldman (sp).
:'( NUUUUU
13THEY WON'T FIND YOUR BODY IN MY CHIN NOW TELL ME
Pinky Joker: Chimicherrychanga, b*tch. :O
01,11RANDOM TRIVIA: The picture of the joker without his makeup was posted online. People thought it was a picture of a real Serviceman and bitched at the OP for making fun of a military man with physical scars.
GOOOOOORRRRRRDDDDDOOOONNNNNNNNNN!!! ......'s Fishermaaaan......
otakon: ah ok
Rachel Dawes
Rachel Dawes isrecast AGAIN
Gordon has an extra life

oh hey, mcully kulken
Silverscreen: I saw that one. Many lulz were to be had
haha
Dat kid looks like Mcully.
:'(
That is so not Culkin.
lol Silverscreen I remember that on Tumblr. Freakin idiots. They started whining about everyone being a jerk
Buytoast: no but his brother is in the movies now he played Wallace Wells in Scott Pilgrim
Fun fact, James Gordon Jr. grows up to be a sociopath in the comics.
13he wants to talk to a stripper?
O.O
Suddenly nightclub.
oontzoontzoontz
Batman ruining familys since Allways
Culkin was like 30 at the time this was filmed
Shizuka: sounds good to me
She needs to stop blaming and take responsibly.
/me snuggles up next to otakon
00,10time for the bat watusi
what a terrible fate
strippers make for scintillating conversations
batman beyond memories...
"Kid please, i lost BOTH parents..."
Um.. Batman... That is not how you party in a night club
having to play a role in that terriblem movie
What makes you think I wanna hear you talk?
Holy rave party, Batman!
and then the fight night club
Its not all about Fistycuffs man
I said the kid looked like Mculkin not was him.
Batman in da club
CLASSY
Barbetos: He's the batman.
01,11Also, gordon references his daughter, who in the animated series and the comics grew up to be batgirl.
epic
6_9
hey, now it's a Bat Rave!
I would like to see how they would make a batman beyond Movie :)
batman knows how to party
Barbetos, Batman parties however the fuck he wants.
Would be pretty fun
Barbetos: He's setting a new club fashion trend.
6_9
Needs more multicolored lights
did someone ping me?
club cant even handle Batman right now
This is why you dont invite Batman to clubs
My parents are deeeeeeeeead! :|
Random Movie Trivia: The guy playing Maroney also plays a villian in the classic film, SHARKTAPUS
George Clooney is best Batman
What if they made Teen Titans movie?
A Bat Masterson movie would be pretty wizard
08,01Abed is best Batman
at least there isnt anything stupid like say a bat card or something
otakon: spiritwaffle did.
DERPDERPDERPDERP: classic?

Night alexxm Sleep well :)
Bat shark repelant.

I like to imagine that whenever Batman in this movie is doing something cool, he's humming to himself "Da na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na Me!"

WHERE IS HE??!!!! {:(
:)

Mad Hatter is probably my favorite minor-ish villain.
Lunac too bad
Why hasn't Killer Croc been in a live action Batman movie yet - I bet he'd look amazing with cg tech now
01,11otakon: as outlandish as fear gas made out of toxins poured into the sewer system and released via a big evaporating machine?
Batpants.
Alrighty. Let's try this again, shall we?
Pow!
Cypresswolf would need too much cgi
Time to interogate.
the fact that he's talking is insane. i broke my arm and couldn't do anything but grunt for at least 20 minutes
play some Russian Roulette
dat smile
GIVE ME THE ANSWERS NOW!
Silverscreen: at least THAT is feasable a MIND CONTROL MACHINE is not
/me glomps IshPonyPony
IHE WOUDNT
recoome vibrator
oh he would
is there such a thing as too much cgi?
Killer Croc looks pretty darn good in the Arkham Asylum series.
Bjornfot go molest otakon
00,10Defence noted
his head is on top of it
Cypresswolf yes
:)
That twoface
Pale_Horse: he's too damn big
01,11otakon: outright mind control, yes, but brainwashing has been proven possible.
/me holds otakon down for Bjornfot
why not a body suit
But I've already done that...
Silverscreen: true
Tails. I take your Sonic collection
frmiliar?
0,14...settle down
otakon The mad hatter is one of batmans most feasable enemeies
Cypresswolf: Star Wars Episode 1?
lets try that again
no
-_-
Bjornfot well keep it up
You keep your tail
He's a mutant. he's supposed to be kid of off from human-model. :P

Alright, sith, lets start by dipping half of you into corrosive chemicals.
Night Michael !

You'll have the best two-face costume ever.

YOU CAN'T GIVE IN, BUT I CAN
wich they ruind in the end , thats all i say.

Thulu-tan: you supply the vats of chemicals
YOU CANT GIVE IN
01,11Notice only dent's GOOD side is shown throughout this scene. Very clever lighting.
0,14oh crap, I've brought attention to my self
Jervis was the mad hatters name i guess.
Shizuka RIGHT THERE
pony_300: Nope, it's... something else. Travis I think.
That's your fault.
13HE MUST HAVE FRIENDS
YOU CANT GIVE IN
/me glomps otakon
Silverscreen: eeyup
Hopefully with Avengers we can get some fantastical Batman villans in movies. I can't see these CGI villians in srs Nolanverse
Oh nope, RosePetal is right, it's Jervis Treck, or something like that.
i just need to take half my face and dip it in acid
so many face foreshadowing
/me gives SaxyPretender lots of attention
mad hatter is lewis carrol...get it?
spiritwaffle: okay I have to ask why have you been hanging on me tonight?
I think the villain Batman should fight in his next movie should be SNOWFLAME! THE MAN POWERED BY COCAINE! :D
SaxyPretender: Quick! Put on the tanooki suit.
OpticalPie: yes
lol.
no just gather a group of hero's and whoop there flank :D
Pale_Horse: Cocainium

They're rebooting Batman for the Justice League film actually.
Tovler: isn't there going to be somesort of reboot of Batman so they can work up to a justice league movie?
spiritwaffle: well thanks for that
hey can any pony tell me about how lottery works
damn it he knows
Dat signal.
Justice league directed by Nollan , would be epic :)
Rocket Racoon?
Pale_Horse: Played by Charlie Sheen

Would make Perfect sence
True, Batman Beyond would be interesting.
00,10Whistler you are way behind
New actor :)
Silverscreen: lose*
New villains
he doesn't in the next because Bruce is more or less gonna get himself killed if he tries to be Batman again.
Tovler no we need a Steel reboot
No need to reuse old acotrs
what if there was a new batman movie featuring the kid from TDKR
actors*
people are stupid
wait Howard the Duck was one of the first Marvel Movies?
no thanks

Bronysith: It would be called "Nightwing."
Nope.

Firetruck on fire.

I'm from the GTA generation so seeing cops and SWAT die is GLORIOUS
IshPonyPony: Batman & Robin wasn't a reboot.
xD
it was all cleared
opps
Dat PUn
RAWRity: If he were a Marvel character, he'd probably be dead now because it would look to much like a self-promotion.
theres a large enough gap infront of the fire truck
Lunac: yeah but those guys are assholes
08,01otakon: i've got it: Claudia Black
dat accidental plan
otakon ?
FIRE+TRUCK = FIRETRUCK , ha hi ha ho ho hi
I can't think of anyone to play Wonder Woman so i'm not sure.
for some reason this movie reminds me of the anime Trigun
I could see it
fail
from the cut
Lunac: GTA cops
Splash.
Fail :D
Lock and blub
lock and FAIL
he drives like me
swat truck vs trash truck who will win? :|
i think Tara STrong should be wonder woman
(s)Laughter is best medicine
JOKER.
Slaughter

RPG
Bronysith: most common super power?
Also Retro City Rampage
HE FOUND IT!
nope, rpg
that guy had to say it
then 1966 film also wasn't a film franchise. It was a continuation of the Adam West TV series.
Then he gets a torpedo!
Welp
XD
lol
He never asked for this.
Gumri: at least another hour
00,10so slam on the brakes
he only had 2 days til retirement!
I NEVER ASKED FOR THIS!
13driver is so stoic
Meanwhile: lol
*the
adam west is best batman
I never asked for this

^
Knowing Nolan, that's probably a real bazooka
= me on NFS:C
Yes you did, it's exactly what you signed on for!
Ohgod I haven't seen this for ages. xD
"I'm too old for this shit!:
shot at the joker
-_- an hour! Im getting sleepy :)
Sumica he;s a cop in cGotham he did sign up for this.
How did he get a license?
It's in your contract and everything.
Look outs.

Kevin Conroy is best Blablam
Gumri: georgia
so much perfect timing in this movie
BOOM!

pony_300: agreed
We need some epic music for this chase.
otakon how do you know Wonder womans breast size so exactly?
00,10so that's why they call it the tumbler
badum tssh
Still better than Keaton-Batman bombing the shit out of a factory, I guess.
otakon O.o
lol
05,15these Batman movies do give off a Deus Ex vibe
RosePetal: That would just make it too epic
Would Wonder Woman fly since people don't know she can fly?
Lunac: I don't but she's always been on the busty side. Hell the Powerpuff girls made a JOKE on it
george clooney as batman=shit
well you've got a flight accross the pond then :P
RAWRity: :D You're placement of Clooney.
Tovler: yes
DID THEY?
O.o
Everlasting_Joy: *your
otakon bust jokes are Power Girl department
Kevin Conroy is best Batman
MaxTheBrony: yeah they did it was like a minute joke
13freeman drive this truck
adam west

You know what bothers me about this whole sequence? The driver NEVER talks
WTF
i liek this job
I'll find it and link it hold on

Kevin Conroy
Bronysith: Thank you. How I missed that is beyond me.
WANT!

Transform and roll out
The cop knew all about the Joker. Or he doesnt know.

Batbike engaged.
Barbetos Ofcourse hes not
goodbye
Silverscreen: yeah good idea actually
Batbike time
Poor Batmobile
The Batman has left his car - Let's Loot It!
No batmobile....
Silverscreen Batman is the equal to any marvel hereo
RosePetal: Maybe he hasn't realized Joker is following them yet. :P
Barbetos hes a good driver :p no talking just looking on the road
05,15If Freeman is driving then I want to hear Ross Scott do his internal monologue
A Black Panther movie? Of course not
Silverscreen: thats actually a really good idea
How does no one ever connect Batman to Bruce Wayne without just taking a minor glance at the stuff he's got?
00,10batman gives no fucks for bad luck
takes bat man peices of car X3
Hey everyone
Music has finally played :)
Bat-Tank
Douchebag batman
xD
The audience is the driver? Clever... I guess.
And in 5 seconds it's gone
Still bothers me though.
Ruining 500 mirrors
Hi, Xaiden :)
10000 years missfortune
combo-2xcombo-3xcombo
lol those kids.
The kids broke it!
05,15"Well, I guess the universe DOES want me dead, I escape Black Mesa, and now a psycho clown is trying to KILL me."
Meanwhile Bruse Wayne acts too much like an arshole in public to see viable to be batman
l33t
kewl
Kids are lucky they didn't die
01,11http://fanartexhibit.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/airbrushed_ww_colour_by_joshwmc.jpg
Now those kids are forever traumatized.
This part is always a stretch. Sometimes I think they make Joker TOO clever and plan too far ahead.
lol
bai everypony
BEWSH!
00,10oh come on /sweetiebelle
That's not good. Bit of an understatement there.
:(, take care IshPonyPony.
Colateral Damage - Batman dont give a fuck
Everyone has there opinion.
13DERPDERPDERPDERP: so the entirety of death note
wait, is lottery tonight or tommorrow?
xD
lol batman does not care.
Batman never gives a fuck
IshPonyPony: Tomorrow.
Shizu: Just as planned!
Just doing some batman shoping.
bai everypony
01,11DERPDERPDERPDERP: So knowing that he'll have Arial support is thinking too far ahead?
00,10dont like my driveing, get off the sidewalk

Get out the way!
Shizuka: Hm. This is true.
13you know
Fuck yur trash
13at this point
he went dumpster diving
chicken
13i think batman has caused more property damage than the joker
Jousting!
05,15"It'd be a lot easier to get away from The Joker if I had a grappling hook"
01,11Not to mention that he has ties inside of the police department, so he would know the route that these guys are using.
Shizuka: nah, at times death note wasnt thought through nearly enough
HIT ME!
I can imagine the fine Batman has to pay WITHOUT the use of Bat Credit Card.
Shizuka: yeah but HE hasn't killed anybody
now theres a batman>why so serious
Shizu: Agreed

Epic flip
i actually saw a video of a car flipping like that
Silverscreen: No, but knowing exactly the route the copter will take, how low they'll be flying, etc is a bit of a stretch.

01,11BEST effect in the entire film.
00,10damit joker you pressed z twice
DAYUM

Night night Gumri.

That part with the truck is always awesome.

"Can you just give me a minute?" :D

00,10yeah so how dose it not shock him?
A shit load of cutlery
Look at all of teh weapons.

Guess he must play a thief
Sumica: the charge was spent
Only electrifed on the outside
Enough knives?
movie's over everybody go home!

I just realized that scene from Flash Gordon with BRIAN BLESSED would fit in that previus scene
he hid himself to repair himself
cute
did i just hear "yay"
I thought two would be enough knifes
Wonderful taste in vests though.
Knives and lint.
YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
yay
hello everypony how are y'all :)

WHY?
inb4 divorce
SLAP!!
I dont SEE THE POINT OF THIS?
RosePetal Fluttershy is everywhere at once
I'm at the point where I can't even hear the yays anymore
i just took my headset off and i heard that bitch smack
Why put him In a Public Cell!?
O.o
I'd love to be stuck in a cell with The Joker.
MaxTheBrony: not enough time to process him
Bronysith: Probably because it would take time they don't care to waste?
01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Joker's applause was not scripted. Ledger did it on a whim and Nolan liked it so much that he kept it in the film.
Aircrafter: you'd be ded
He should go to Arkham Dirctly?
MaxTheBrony: Because dumb
O.o
Silverscreen: awesome
Aircrafter, you sure about that?
Silverscreen: just goddamn awesome
and ledgers sexiness would melt everyones faces
Aircrafter: *facepalm*
It's all a matter of volume. I can still hear the yays when it's quiet, not when it's loud.
Silverscreen: THAT IS AWESOME.
00,10that's how in to the role he was
:)
too bad he's dead
Silverscreen: That seems to be a recurring theme in this film...
05,15So basically, Heath Ledger just made everything up, and it was fantastic
otakon / ASoftFluffyThing / Xaiden : I'm kinky like that.
GIVE HIM A KISS MUTHA FU*KA
otakon: yup,
some dad
Fluttercry: eeyup
Fluttecry: prtty much.
^
well well well, mr freeman.
and now i go to bed before the fairys come and get me
XD
Oh, this scene.
Basically yes, Fluttercry. He was dead into the role.
Aircrafter....okaaaay.....um...have fun with that.
Commiiiiishioner
This scene got the sfm tf2 treatment.
inb4 WHERE ARE
i though freeman has a daughter
Who me?
THEY

What if Batman Farted or like cought in this scene xD
I like the Joker's personality, just I don't like to be around him
Source Filmaker FTW.
^^
Ah, the Good Cop, Bat Cop routine.
ASoftFluffyThing: :3
05,15The lip smaking...oh god the lip smaking
why am I thinking of Johnny Depp?
buffer show
and on that note
penis
forever alone
Why would they leave his makeup on?
CrimsonPhoenix: me too
CrimsonPhoenix, probably the way he's talking.
01,11Fluttercry: that a good or bad thing? I find it unsettling, but in a good way for the character.
CrimsonPhoenix: Becuz Jonny plays roles like this
I like the Joker (yes I'm a girl) but I wouldn't wanna go near him. He probably would kill me.
lol
okaaay...
05,15I like it, it makes him creepy as hell
I still have player issues. I had to refresh again. *sigh*
Schrodinger's Cat?
01,11STALLING STALLING STALLING!

A lot of women like dangerous men

Suddenly Batman approaches.

I always thought Batman's mouth looks funny
Dat lip smack.

WHY U WANNA KILL ME?!

WHY DO YOU WANNA KILL ME!?
BARRGBABBAA
Pale_Horse: :D

05,15"Do you have something in your mouth" "I ate a peanut butter sandwich earlier"
Shizuka: You sure it wasnt thelight that suddenly blinds him.
his lipstick must taste good XD
YOU...COMPLETE ME
i love you, batsie..
Tenant as Joker wouldn't be able to stop licking the make-up
I have to admit I loved the white makeup on his face. And it rubbing off.

STUPID FUCKING AD.
13he winces but it's clearly bracing for the slam
01,11"By the way, you have something on your lip"
Kismesis. :D

Natural skin color on the forehead being exposed...
Like a leper!
Why didn't they ever wipe off Jokers' face
/me smacks lips repeatedly
Shizuka the blink was because the lights suddenly turned on
