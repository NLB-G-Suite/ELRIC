o.o
yeah-
they should also have a writer go through it and fix the grammar and such-
bbbff on Hub <3
I played without voices after the tutorial
thats cool
still cant wait for act 2 ><
no disrespect to the VA's, but I just like it without voice in text games
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTabEPRSEeQ&feature=relmfu
I do wish it was more interactive though
go suggest to them then ask them for option to disable them
yeah I like the engine, but in the lua you can add even more choices
and in text games i really like the option to choose whenever you have a decision that affects the mood
like talking to Trixie, you should have more than one choice direct the entire conversation
of course of course
but that's how those kind of novelle games play, while I'm more fond of mud or CYOA like Choice of
hmm
that would be neat-
yea the choices were kinda limited
do you know Choicescript? If you like writing stories, it is a great way to attempt and basic--story telling in games
i heard
- the and
id like to get into making a pony RPG
there are attemp or still in develpment i heard
